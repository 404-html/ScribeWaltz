<v Speaker 2>I forget.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Desires have more than one.</v>

119
00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.800
<v Speaker 2>A can an aim to more than one spot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like with a button.</v>

120
00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:15.361
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

121
00:05:15.361 --> 00:05:18.100
<v Speaker 2>you can move it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's the fact yet.</v>

122
00:05:18.101 --> 00:05:19.750
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then there's also a friendship which</v>

123
00:05:19.751 --> 00:05:20.620
<v Speaker 2>is obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so women,</v>

124
00:05:20.621 --> 00:05:22.230
<v Speaker 2>but for know where that fits.</v>

125
00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.610
<v Speaker 2>Hammer your boss or you can do a ball </v>
<v Speaker 2>shot.</v>

126
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:28.150
<v Speaker 2>I saw some dude on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It got hit no on the Internet.</v>

127
00:05:28.151 --> 00:05:31.630
<v Speaker 2>Rather a video clip of someone who he </v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy in front of,</v>

128
00:05:31.631 --> 00:05:32.464
<v Speaker 2>he was a catcher and the guy in front of</v>
<v Speaker 2>him just barely clipped the ball and it </v>

129
00:05:35.171 --> 00:05:39.510
<v Speaker 2>Corinne to perfectly and it was nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you see this fast ball?</v>

130
00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.840
<v Speaker 2>As hard as Paul just targeted his nut </v>
<v Speaker 2>sack bang.</v>

131
00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:46.020
<v Speaker 2>And even though it's a like an animated </v>
<v Speaker 2>gift,</v>

132
00:05:46.021 --> 00:05:48.820
<v Speaker 2>it's only a couple seconds long and as </v>
<v Speaker 2>soon as that ball hits the ground,</v>

133
00:05:48.821 --> 00:05:51.850
<v Speaker 2>you see his body just given like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

134
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.980
<v Speaker 2>it was like precision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I played lacrosse and that once.</v>

135
00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.520
<v Speaker 2>Oh this is that it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

136
00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:00.800
<v Speaker 3>Well I should have said I should have </v>
<v Speaker 3>retweeted.</v>

137
00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:03.680
<v Speaker 3>That was being selfish with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're being selfish with the ball hit.</v>

138
00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.630
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes I don't read tweak things even</v>

139
00:06:05.631 --> 00:06:07.790
<v Speaker 3>though they're good and then I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why didn't I retweet that?</v>

140
00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:09.380
<v Speaker 3>And then I killed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>try,</v>

141
00:06:09.381 --> 00:06:14.300
<v Speaker 3>go back and find them and they just lost</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sea of replies at replies where they</v>

142
00:06:14.301 --> 00:06:15.530
<v Speaker 3>just get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't.</v>

143
00:06:15.531 --> 00:06:16.940
<v Speaker 3>Here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think this is it.</v>

144
00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:17.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>

145
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:22.550
<v Speaker 3>Watch this and that might have them go </v>
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>

146
00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:23.413
<v Speaker 3>Oh see Bam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it doesn't get any more perfect </v>

147
00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:29.210
<v Speaker 3>because it hits side Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See if you get hit with.</v>

148
00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:31.483
<v Speaker 3>Today's cups are so much better than the</v>
<v Speaker 3>cups we had when we were kids because </v>

149
00:06:34.041 --> 00:06:35.510
<v Speaker 3>the cups we had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you played.</v>

150
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:38.070
<v Speaker 3>Did you play any contact sports?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lacrosse.</v>

151
00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:40.520
<v Speaker 3>So when they have to put those cups in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the jock strap,</v>

152
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:43.160
<v Speaker 3>those fuckers kind of floated around a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit.</v>

153
00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:44.083
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were a terrible where one half the </v>

154
00:06:45.771 --> 00:06:49.010
<v Speaker 3>time I can Lacrosse I stopped wearing a </v>
<v Speaker 3>cup because it was because I would just.</v>

155
00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:52.970
<v Speaker 3>They would just start hurting my balls,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that little line part of that,</v>

156
00:06:52.971 --> 00:06:53.804
<v Speaker 3>like the edge would sometimes just get </v>
<v Speaker 3>above the ball and then one time I got </v>

157
00:06:56.841 --> 00:06:57.674
<v Speaker 3>hit by like a 90 mile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an hour shot and the ball goes 90 miles </v>

158
00:07:01.671 --> 00:07:02.360
<v Speaker 3>an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

159
00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.820
<v Speaker 3>And it's just hard rubber.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ninety miles.</v>

160
00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:06.800
<v Speaker 3>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I use those things for massage.</v>

161
00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:07.940
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're crazy.</v>

162
00:07:07.941 --> 00:07:08.774
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would take one of those Lacrosse </v>

163
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.270
<v Speaker 3>Paul's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you lie on your back folks,</v>

164
00:07:11.271 --> 00:07:12.670
<v Speaker 3>if anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have like,</v>

165
00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:13.543
<v Speaker 3>back soreness and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if you don't want to pay </v>

166
00:07:16.311 --> 00:07:19.310
<v Speaker 3>someone to massage you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you can take the pain,</v>

167
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:20.263
<v Speaker 3>you can do it yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take a Lacrosse ball or we have those </v>

168
00:07:22.911 --> 00:07:24.930
<v Speaker 3>other balls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

169
00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:27.520
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do they mean?</v>

170
00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:28.880
<v Speaker 3>Who makes them row?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

171
00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:30.960
<v Speaker 3>Rogue makes some rogue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Athletics makes them,</v>

172
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.120
<v Speaker 3>they're fucking awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're called um,</v>

173
00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:37.060
<v Speaker 3>a wad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Supernovas Jamie.</v>

174
00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:37.903
<v Speaker 3>Go grab one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've got it like right outside the </v>

175
00:07:38.781 --> 00:07:40.130
<v Speaker 3>door.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what that thing is?</v>

176
00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:44.990
<v Speaker 3>How do these guys can throw like 1:20</v>
<v Speaker 3>right there out of their mind?</v>

177
00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:45.461
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

178
00:07:45.461 --> 00:07:47.660
<v Speaker 3>it's psychotic because it got the </v>
<v Speaker 3>leverage of it.</v>

179
00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:48.523
<v Speaker 3>And it's also a sport where you get </v>
<v Speaker 3>super good at and then what you don't </v>

180
00:07:51.021 --> 00:07:53.480
<v Speaker 3>even have a fucking career until if that</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>

181
00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:58.100
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's guys that are probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>like just fucking aces at that shit,</v>

182
00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:01.060
<v Speaker 3>but they can't go into the nfl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nhl or the.</v>

183
00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:03.620
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was nothing now there Jamie.</v>

184
00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:06.530
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they make them.</v>

185
00:08:06.531 --> 00:08:08.620
<v Speaker 3>I think Kelly started invented it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they,</v>

186
00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:10.940
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if that's not correct,</v>

187
00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:12.780
<v Speaker 3>but they uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know Kelly star,</v>

188
00:08:12.781 --> 00:08:13.614
<v Speaker 3>it was the one of the first guys to </v>
<v Speaker 3>suggest using a Lacrosse ball and you </v>

189
00:08:16.911 --> 00:08:19.190
<v Speaker 3>take this lacrosse ball,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the Wad Supernova,</v>

190
00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:21.080
<v Speaker 3>but you can use a cross ball.</v>

191
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:22.663
<v Speaker 3>I use one all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I take it with me on the road because </v>

192
00:08:23.601 --> 00:08:24.434
<v Speaker 3>it's super little.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you take one of those hard little </v>

193
00:08:25.851 --> 00:08:30.620
<v Speaker 3>fuckers and just lay it on the ground </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then bridge over it like a wrestling</v>

194
00:08:30.621 --> 00:08:31.454
<v Speaker 3>bridge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just put all your weight into that </v>

195
00:08:32.741 --> 00:08:33.574
<v Speaker 3>recall ball and just roll it up and down</v>
<v Speaker 3>like any kind of not you have in your </v>

196
00:08:36.291 --> 00:08:39.260
<v Speaker 3>bag as painful as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need some backstabbing.</v>

197
00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:40.133
<v Speaker 3>Like that's the six,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seven back is not fun after a certain </v>

198
00:08:43.701 --> 00:08:46.820
<v Speaker 3>age just starts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Baxter,</v>

199
00:08:46.821 --> 00:08:49.100
<v Speaker 3>temporary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like tires.</v>

200
00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:50.263
<v Speaker 3>You could wear those fuckers out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to be careful and you have to </v>

201
00:08:52.251 --> 00:08:56.190
<v Speaker 3>do maintenance work like backs or like </v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the most</v>

202
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:58.590
<v Speaker 1>common things that people enjoy and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>changed their life.</v>

203
00:08:58.830 --> 00:08:59.663
<v Speaker 1>Like if you hurt your hand it sucks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it probably isn't going to change </v>

204
00:09:02.431 --> 00:09:03.264
<v Speaker 1>your life like a back thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will he break your hand if you've ever </v>

205
00:09:06.031 --> 00:09:07.220
<v Speaker 1>broken a hand?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

206
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:08.513
<v Speaker 1>I broke my arm once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember I was a little kid and I had </v>

207
00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:11.470
<v Speaker 1>an a cast and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

208
00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:12.323
<v Speaker 1>I didn't learn how to write with my left</v>
<v Speaker 1>hand and it really sunk in my head for </v>

209
00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:15.810
<v Speaker 1>strokes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>

210
00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:16.693
<v Speaker 1>if you're ambidextrous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it lowers your chances of having a </v>

211
00:09:18.031 --> 00:09:19.110
<v Speaker 1>stroke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

212
00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:20.670
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My uh,</v>

213
00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:21.533
<v Speaker 1>my uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uncles and anesthetists or </v>

214
00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:25.290
<v Speaker 1>anesthesiologists and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

215
00:09:25.291 --> 00:09:27.300
<v Speaker 1>just write your name with your left hand</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot.</v>

216
00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:28.453
<v Speaker 1>And he said that there's something about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that keeps the neuroplasticity </v>

217
00:09:30.661 --> 00:09:31.494
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it only writing your name is only </v>

218
00:09:32.551 --> 00:09:34.230
<v Speaker 1>writing or other things as well?</v>

219
00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.690
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just having the skill hand </v>
<v Speaker 1>switch.</v>

220
00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:37.973
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's funny you say that because they </v>

221
00:09:39.091 --> 00:09:39.924
<v Speaker 1>say that that's one of the best ways to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get good at a skill is to practice it </v>

222
00:09:42.361 --> 00:09:44.160
<v Speaker 1>with your opposite side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

223
00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:45.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like um,</v>

224
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:50.040
<v Speaker 1>they say that with striking that when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you learn how to strike,</v>

225
00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:53.580
<v Speaker 1>say like if you stand orthodox means </v>
<v Speaker 1>your left hand is Ford.</v>

226
00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:54.473
<v Speaker 1>When I say striking him in martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you stand with your left hand </v>

227
00:09:57.061 --> 00:09:57.894
<v Speaker 1>forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>usually guys do that because there are </v>

228
00:09:59.911 --> 00:10:02.550
<v Speaker 1>powerful and the right hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if they switched it,</v>

229
00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:05.600
<v Speaker 1>like if you're a right handed person and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you put the power,</v>

230
00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:09.570
<v Speaker 1>the backhand in the left side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it comes out super awkward to me.</v>

231
00:10:09.571 --> 00:10:13.830
<v Speaker 1>To this day I've been doing martial arts</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of my life and my left hand is just</v>

232
00:10:13.831 --> 00:10:14.970
<v Speaker 1>straight dog shit.</v>

233
00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:20.430
<v Speaker 1>Throw a left out of the bag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks so awkward and Clunky,</v>

234
00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:23.220
<v Speaker 1>but my right hand is pretty stout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought.</v>

235
00:10:23.221 --> 00:10:24.001
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for piano,</v>

236
00:10:24.001 --> 00:10:28.200
<v Speaker 1>it's like that with the melody and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy tried to play songs with melodies on</v>

237
00:10:28.201 --> 00:10:29.034
<v Speaker 1>the lefthand and it's so hard that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to almost relearn piano I would </v>

238
00:10:32.851 --> 00:10:33.900
<v Speaker 1>imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

239
00:10:33.901 --> 00:10:36.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean because like you're thinking in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>

240
00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:37.603
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just don't think it's all I played </v>

241
00:10:39.181 --> 00:10:42.750
<v Speaker 1>since I was so young and it's so fast </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can't possibly think.</v>

242
00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.600
<v Speaker 1>And so then like sometimes I'll forget </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way,</v>

243
00:10:45.601 --> 00:10:49.140
<v Speaker 1>like a box songs going and it's almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that south park with Cartman,</v>

244
00:10:49.141 --> 00:10:50.370
<v Speaker 1>like you have to start from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning.</v>

245
00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:52.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I don't know how to just jump in</v>

246
00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:53.700
<v Speaker 1>because I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

247
00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:55.590
<v Speaker 1>it's just instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know what I'm doing.</v>

248
00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:57.000
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're the only.</v>

249
00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:00.390
<v Speaker 1>The only argument for keeping the piano </v>
<v Speaker 1>on stage at the Improv.</v>

250
00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:02.483
<v Speaker 1>And Craig Robinson for Craig Robinson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it brings keyboards with them </v>

251
00:11:04.741 --> 00:11:05.910
<v Speaker 1>places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good point.</v>

252
00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:06.980
<v Speaker 1>You're not really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

253
00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:08.340
<v Speaker 1>bring a keyboard on the road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guy.</v>

254
00:11:08.341 --> 00:11:09.050
<v Speaker 1>Aria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

255
00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:10.680
<v Speaker 1>if they don't have a piano,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

256
00:11:10.681 --> 00:11:12.810
<v Speaker 1>usually they provide it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but every now and then they just won't.</v>

257
00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:15.360
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just forget one when you're in town</v>

258
00:11:15.361 --> 00:11:16.194
<v Speaker 1>or how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you work at like the Improv and </v>

259
00:11:17.641 --> 00:11:20.250
<v Speaker 1>funny bones usually do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if I'm doing like an obscure club,</v>

260
00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:21.031
<v Speaker 1>they'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

261
00:11:21.031 --> 00:11:22.140
<v Speaker 1>it's a contract,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

262
00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:24.530
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't mind because I just,</v>

263
00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:27.300
<v Speaker 1>I usually go to like best buy or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something and then I'll either return it</v>

264
00:11:27.301 --> 00:11:28.134
<v Speaker 1>or give it to a kid or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's funny when someone just doesn't </v>

265
00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:33.310
<v Speaker 1>honor a contract.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a guy once a week for it.</v>

266
00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:34.243
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a club once and like specifically </v>

267
00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:39.270
<v Speaker 1>we laid out that everyone has to have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>seat.</v>

268
00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:42.780
<v Speaker 1>You can have standing room like in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>back of this place.</v>

269
00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:43.673
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then you're going to make less </v>

270
00:11:44.971 --> 00:11:45.421
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

271
00:11:45.421 --> 00:11:48.540
<v Speaker 1>that's okay because this way at least I </v>
<v Speaker 1>know the show will be good.</v>

272
00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:49.700
<v Speaker 1>Like I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to see doug's.</v>

273
00:11:49.701 --> 00:11:52.350
<v Speaker 1>Dan helped me in a couple of friends and</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

274
00:11:52.351 --> 00:11:54.160
<v Speaker 1>it was at a place where I had to stand </v>
<v Speaker 1>long</v>

275
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.140
<v Speaker 3>time ago and I remember going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

276
00:11:56.141 --> 00:11:57.910
<v Speaker 3>this blows right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

277
00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:00.340
<v Speaker 3>this isn't even half as good as sitting </v>
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>

278
00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:02.590
<v Speaker 3>It's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So from then on,</v>

279
00:12:02.591 --> 00:12:03.940
<v Speaker 3>like I used to go to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

280
00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:06.160
<v Speaker 3>house of Blues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are infamous for it.</v>

281
00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:07.003
<v Speaker 3>They'd have a big seating area in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>front and then to the side they have </v>

282
00:12:09.821 --> 00:12:14.470
<v Speaker 3>this open bar area and you would just go</v>
<v Speaker 3>on stage talking at a bar.</v>

283
00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:17.320
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was like people were just </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking.</v>

284
00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:19.090
<v Speaker 3>It's like they're moving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're standing,</v>

285
00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:21.400
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you can do that by the way.</v>

286
00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:25.600
<v Speaker 3>You can get into that road gig mentality</v>
<v Speaker 3>and go up there,</v>

287
00:12:25.601 --> 00:12:28.240
<v Speaker 3>but it's a different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The road gig mentality.</v>

288
00:12:28.241 --> 00:12:29.860
<v Speaker 3>You've got to be prepared for the road </v>
<v Speaker 3>gig.</v>

289
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:30.833
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to be prepared for not getting </v>

290
00:12:31.601 --> 00:12:32.890
<v Speaker 3>crowd consent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

291
00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:34.020
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

292
00:12:34.021 --> 00:12:34.854
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like a lot of crowd can set where I'm </v>

293
00:12:36.311 --> 00:12:36.821
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

294
00:12:36.821 --> 00:12:38.860
<v Speaker 3>you gotta kiss back or we can't do </v>
<v Speaker 3>Doggie.</v>

295
00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:40.503
<v Speaker 3>You also have to be willing to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to understand that there's </v>

296
00:12:43.991 --> 00:12:45.370
<v Speaker 3>going to be like randoms.</v>

299
00:12:49.571 --> 00:12:53.620
<v Speaker 3>of punchlines setups.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If there's anything that requires quiet,</v>

300
00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:56.680
<v Speaker 3>like there's any like weird bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have like a long pause,</v>

<v Speaker 3>he just looked at me.</v>

322
00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:32.343
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're here.</v>

323
00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:33.730
<v Speaker 3>We're doing this show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what we did.</v>

324
00:13:33.731 --> 00:13:35.020
<v Speaker 3>I sold extra tickets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fucked you.</v>

325
00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:37.930
<v Speaker 3>You mother fucker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You was like,</v>

326
00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.000
<v Speaker 3>I'm not motivated by the same shit as </v>
<v Speaker 3>human.</v>

327
00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:41.620
<v Speaker 3>I want the audience to have a good </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>

328
00:13:41.621 --> 00:13:43.810
<v Speaker 3>You just want more cash.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was still made plenty of money.</v>

329
00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:44.933
<v Speaker 3>We're still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about the difference </v>

330
00:13:45.671 --> 00:13:49.840
<v Speaker 3>between like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was like 300 to 500 seats,</v>

331
00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:53.110
<v Speaker 3>so 300 seeds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seeding or you could do 500 years,</v>

332
00:13:53.111 --> 00:13:53.944
<v Speaker 3>200 standing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they filled the whole back of this </v>

333
00:13:55.571 --> 00:14:00.160
<v Speaker 3>era because he had a big bar area,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a big long area and that whole back</v>

334
00:14:00.161 --> 00:14:00.560
<v Speaker 3>area too.</v>

335
00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:03.380
<v Speaker 3>To me it's mostly a place they have </v>
<v Speaker 3>bands right now.</v>

336
00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:07.660
<v Speaker 3>So I've eaten shit with a standing only </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I wasn't,</v>

337
00:14:07.661 --> 00:14:10.670
<v Speaker 3>I didn't make the adjustment pre show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

338
00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:14.410
<v Speaker 3>so in my mind I'm like I'm doing standup</v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy and I go out there and I'm like I</v>

339
00:14:14.411 --> 00:14:15.910
<v Speaker 3>should be a pink floyd cover band </v>
<v Speaker 3>tonight.</v>

340
00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:17.453
<v Speaker 3>Who wants to hear the wall?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got to have a different kind of </v>

341
00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:20.613
<v Speaker 3>energy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have like almost like a carnival </v>

342
00:14:22.001 --> 00:14:24.130
<v Speaker 3>barker energy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

343
00:14:24.131 --> 00:14:26.800
<v Speaker 3>Like you got to get those people </v>
<v Speaker 3>interested in paying attention.</v>

344
00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:27.753
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when I was at a renaissance fair </v>

345
00:14:29.921 --> 00:14:31.660
<v Speaker 3>heckler in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was my job,</v>

346
00:14:31.661 --> 00:14:35.380
<v Speaker 3>like in the stock and people would pay </v>
<v Speaker 3>money to throw tomatoes at me.</v>

347
00:14:35.381 --> 00:14:36.214
<v Speaker 3>So it was all just figuring out what </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone's vulnerability was and just </v>

348
00:14:38.981 --> 00:14:41.340
<v Speaker 3>exploiting it and just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was carnival barking too.</v>

349
00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:44.950
<v Speaker 3>I was working with only the guy's name </v>
<v Speaker 3>was boob and he was a,</v>

350
00:14:44.951 --> 00:14:47.370
<v Speaker 3>a boob full name who you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

351
00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:48.213
<v Speaker 3>And he was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

352
00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:49.890
<v Speaker 3>just gypsies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gypsies,</v>

353
00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:50.733
<v Speaker 3>and I was just trying to beat the joust </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I get big crowds because it was all </v>

354
00:14:55.911 --> 00:14:58.700
<v Speaker 3>about letting them win occasionally </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you couldn't just be like,</v>

355
00:14:58.730 --> 00:14:59.990
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that tomato didn't hurt.</v>

356
00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:01.930
<v Speaker 3>You have to be humiliated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

357
00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:02.600
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

358
00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:03.790
<v Speaker 3>Even play it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

359
00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:06.830
<v Speaker 3>Did I get hammered and let him slap me </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the face for like 20 bucks,</v>

360
00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:10.070
<v Speaker 3>17 I drink,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meet and just be out.</v>

361
00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:13.790
<v Speaker 3>Did you get hurt that way?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know dude knows how to slap good.</v>

362
00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:15.110
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was this one levels,</v>

363
00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:16.420
<v Speaker 3>that slap game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there was a.</v>

364
00:15:16.421 --> 00:15:17.690
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there'd be like a biker.</v>

365
00:15:17.691 --> 00:15:18.201
<v Speaker 3>It'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

366
00:15:18.201 --> 00:15:19.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna throw a rock.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

367
00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:21.140
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'd run to the cornfield.</v>

368
00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:22.233
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's talk to some people did knock you </v>

369
00:15:24.231 --> 00:15:27.190
<v Speaker 3>the fuck out with a slop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We use lab.</v>

370
00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:29.990
<v Speaker 3>It'd be like just some Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you never know who that dickhead.</v>

371
00:15:29.991 --> 00:15:31.160
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

372
00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:33.470
<v Speaker 3>That's super.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the Diaz brothers.</v>

373
00:15:33.471 --> 00:15:34.041
<v Speaker 3>Like you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

374
00:15:34.041 --> 00:15:35.150
<v Speaker 3>you're a normal guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

375
00:15:35.151 --> 00:15:37.150
<v Speaker 3>you're the toughest dude in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

376
00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:39.580
<v Speaker 3>You do not want them slapping you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

377
00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:41.540
<v Speaker 3>Especially if they know they're going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>slap you.</v>

378
00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:42.513
<v Speaker 3>It sounded like an instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like in the middle you said something </v>

379
00:15:43.911 --> 00:15:44.744
<v Speaker 3>stupid to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

380
00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:46.370
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They line up.</v>

381
00:15:46.371 --> 00:15:49.070
<v Speaker 3>But if they like line up and get ready,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is this guy doing?</v>

382
00:15:49.071 --> 00:15:51.640
<v Speaker 3>He's letting the guy slap him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they haven't got a slap off.</v>

383
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.390
<v Speaker 3>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These go are pretty big on the Internet.</v>

384
00:15:54.391 --> 00:15:56.330
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone gets knocked out.</v>

385
00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:57.193
<v Speaker 3>People get knocked the fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That guy just got kod because this guy </v>

386
00:16:00.471 --> 00:16:03.740
<v Speaker 3>hit him right on the job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh wait a minute.</v>

387
00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:06.970
<v Speaker 3>So who went the gift that that was?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was first I come in and.</v>

388
00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:10.170
<v Speaker 3>And so the second,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the second guy killed them.</v>

389
00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:12.350
<v Speaker 3>That's even more impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He took a shot.</v>

390
00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:13.303
<v Speaker 3>Watch this.</v>

391
00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:15.083
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

392
00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:17.203
<v Speaker 3>That dude's out fucking cold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope there was a mat behind him or </v>

393
00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:21.760
<v Speaker 3>someone to catch him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably not</v>

394
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:23.833
<v Speaker 3>less drama,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just because it's the little button and </v>

395
00:16:25.251 --> 00:16:27.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it still shakes the brain.</v>

396
00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:28.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's terrible.</v>

397
00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:32.670
<v Speaker 3>Like that guy's brain got jolted there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His next spun around.</v>

398
00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:35.490
<v Speaker 3>His brain sloshed back and forth and </v>
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

399
00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:36.363
<v Speaker 3>I'm so screwed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to get all that shit when I'm </v>

400
00:16:37.381 --> 00:16:38.214
<v Speaker 3>older from the tomatoes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You probably will a little for real </v>

401
00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:44.080
<v Speaker 3>tomatoes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think hit you $10,000</v>

402
00:16:44.081 --> 00:16:45.510
<v Speaker 3>a day pool?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh No.</v>

403
00:16:45.511 --> 00:16:47.430
<v Speaker 3>They miss a lot that somebody was </v>
<v Speaker 3>thrown.</v>

404
00:16:47.431 --> 00:16:50.400
<v Speaker 3>I was hit hard maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I never got knocked out.</v>

405
00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:51.293
<v Speaker 3>I want to talk to you about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that that might have </v>

406
00:16:54.691 --> 00:16:56.490
<v Speaker 3>something to do with why you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>impulsive?</v>

407
00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:59.240
<v Speaker 3>You're very impulsive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

408
00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:01.290
<v Speaker 3>Wait a good way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you're serious,</v>

409
00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:02.490
<v Speaker 3>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

410
00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:03.150
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

411
00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:07.080
<v Speaker 3>You say some shit online on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're fucking super impulsive.</v>

412
00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:08.760
<v Speaker 3>Like I laugh at him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

413
00:17:08.761 --> 00:17:11.540
<v Speaker 3>this dude just goes for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know about.</v>

414
00:17:11.541 --> 00:17:12.121
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

415
00:17:12.121 --> 00:17:14.060
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just like the art of,</v>

416
00:17:14.061 --> 00:17:18.180
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is an art to saying fucked up shit</v>

417
00:17:18.181 --> 00:17:20.190
<v Speaker 3>and that's one of the things I really </v>
<v Speaker 3>appreciate you about you.</v>

418
00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:21.213
<v Speaker 3>So you're a very smart guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you also appreciate the art of </v>

419
00:17:23.881 --> 00:17:26.900
<v Speaker 3>saying fucked up shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the things that we do and it</v>

420
00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:27.773
<v Speaker 3>doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't get respected enough because </v>

421
00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:31.530
<v Speaker 3>especially today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

422
00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:36.150
<v Speaker 3>you are fucking dancing a fine line </v>
<v Speaker 3>between razor blades and crocodiles.</v>

423
00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:42.270
<v Speaker 3>You offend today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are just super,</v>

424
00:17:42.271 --> 00:17:45.690
<v Speaker 3>Super Cali Audi because I just got a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bull horn sometimes.</v>

425
00:17:45.691 --> 00:17:47.840
<v Speaker 3>I just felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>

426
00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:50.010
<v Speaker 3>I just wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just wanted to keep</v>

427
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:52.200
<v Speaker 1>comedy going mad for myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to.</v>

428
00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:55.500
<v Speaker 1>I just think our job is to not have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>line,</v>

429
00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:56.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try to be kind,</v>

430
00:17:56.971 --> 00:18:00.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time it's like I have to</v>

431
00:18:00.121 --> 00:18:05.040
<v Speaker 1>figure like our job is hyperbole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we work in a truth dungeon and it's</v>

432
00:18:05.041 --> 00:18:05.850
<v Speaker 1>like my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

433
00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:09.060
<v Speaker 1>my thing is I might be wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not lying and I'm wrong a lot.</v>

434
00:18:09.061 --> 00:18:10.940
<v Speaker 1>But in the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

435
00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:12.720
<v Speaker 1>I think what's super important is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

436
00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:16.350
<v Speaker 1>You've made a real good distinction that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you try not to be cruel and.</v>

437
00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:17.910
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's I do too.</v>

438
00:18:17.911 --> 00:18:19.500
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes you miss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

439
00:18:19.501 --> 00:18:22.700
<v Speaker 1>That's another thing about this working </v>
<v Speaker 1>without a net shit boy.</v>

440
00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:24.630
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you miss for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

441
00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:27.930
<v Speaker 1>Something you shouldn't have said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in live shows you try,</v>

442
00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:30.870
<v Speaker 1>you just the impulse comes into your </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind and you go for it.</v>

443
00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:34.860
<v Speaker 1>But under careful consideration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you sat down and thought about it for</v>

444
00:18:34.861 --> 00:18:35.461
<v Speaker 1>a few minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

445
00:18:35.461 --> 00:18:36.294
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't do this bit this and that would </v>

446
00:18:38.071 --> 00:18:38.904
<v Speaker 1>have people misconstrue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if someone took it out of context </v>

447
00:18:40.831 --> 00:18:41.664
<v Speaker 1>would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If someone doesn't understand that this </v>

448
00:18:42.331 --> 00:18:43.164
<v Speaker 1>is what I'm doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just pushing buttons to people who </v>

449
00:18:44.581 --> 00:18:46.650
<v Speaker 1>know him pushing buttons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to be cruel.</v>

450
00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:49.590
<v Speaker 1>They're in the game versus just random </v>
<v Speaker 1>casualties.</v>

451
00:18:49.591 --> 00:18:52.530
<v Speaker 1>And also I think that the outrage Ponzi </v>
<v Speaker 1>scheme people,</v>

452
00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:54.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't even.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even care.</v>

453
00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:58.800
<v Speaker 1>Like I think a lot of people feign </v>
<v Speaker 1>outrage because they don't understand,</v>

454
00:18:58.801 --> 00:18:59.634
<v Speaker 1>but they still want to retain power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then there's people that actually </v>

455
00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:05.280
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll hurt them and that's when I'm like,</v>

456
00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:06.143
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did I?</v>

457
00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:10.170
<v Speaker 1>Because my problem is every now and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll reverse virtue signaling where it's</v>

458
00:19:10.171 --> 00:19:14.640
<v Speaker 1>almost like I'll go farther intense that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I normally would have because I'm trying</v>

459
00:19:14.641 --> 00:19:17.670
<v Speaker 1>to counteract virtue signaling and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

460
00:19:17.671 --> 00:19:18.504
<v Speaker 1>well I'm throwing a punch at someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>that other people don't even might not </v>

461
00:19:21.781 --> 00:19:22.450

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:54.453
<v Speaker 2>Lobsters with and without butter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the difference was dealt with </v>

500
00:20:58.571 --> 00:21:01.330
<v Speaker 2>butter and lobster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This like butter,</v>

00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:02.643
<v Speaker 2>make some shit just way better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that makes way </v>

502
00:21:05.801 --> 00:21:08.950
<v Speaker 2>better as lobster for sure there is no </v>
<v Speaker 2>god damn question.</v>

503
00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:11.240

507
00:21:21.551 --> 00:21:23.800
<v Speaker 2>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just water bugs.</v>

508
00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:24.663

577
00:24:21.651 --> 00:24:23.650
<v Speaker 5>someone's a hypocrite versus other ones </v>
<v Speaker 5>where I'm like,</v>

578
00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:25.250
<v Speaker 5>ah man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel bad for that guy.</v>

579
00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:26.420
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know what you're saying.</v>

580
00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:27.343
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

581
00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:28.200
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

582
00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:31.060
<v Speaker 6>In did you see the hear the podcast I </v>
<v Speaker 6>had the other day with Jamie Kilstein?</v>

583
00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:33.100
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's a good dude,</v>

584
00:24:33.101 --> 00:24:33.934
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The way he came clean about all that </v>

585
00:24:35.591 --> 00:24:36.424
<v Speaker 6>stuff and just talked about how it all </v>
<v Speaker 6>got away from him as like a social </v>

586
00:24:39.401 --> 00:24:40.234
<v Speaker 6>justice warrior and describing in like </v>
<v Speaker 6>really honest and I think super brave </v>

587
00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:46.443
<v Speaker 6>the way he described like this charge </v>
<v Speaker 6>that he would get after going after </v>

588
00:24:49.541 --> 00:24:50.374
<v Speaker 6>someone and calling someone a racist and</v>
<v Speaker 6>getting other people to go after and </v>

589
00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:53.290
<v Speaker 6>trying to get them fired</v>

590
00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:54.203
<v Speaker 5>to gave me a good perspective on myself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like when did the concept of the </v>

591
00:24:56.761 --> 00:24:57.594
<v Speaker 5>attack dog where it's this like an </v>
<v Speaker 5>understood thing where you're going to </v>

592
00:25:01.081 --> 00:25:01.914
<v Speaker 5>attack for the group and then it's like </v>
<v Speaker 5>then you start seeking approval from </v>

593
00:25:05.071 --> 00:25:07.890
<v Speaker 5>strangers and how much of it is actually</v>
<v Speaker 5>your own opinion at that point.</v>

594
00:25:07.891 --> 00:25:10.760
<v Speaker 5>And that's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very profound thing to think about.</v>

595
00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:11.713
<v Speaker 6>We,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we have a series in our brain is filled </v>

596
00:25:14.651 --> 00:25:18.370
<v Speaker 6>with the series of reward systems that </v>
<v Speaker 6>are in place,</v>

597
00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:19.443
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like there's,</v>

598
00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:22.270
<v Speaker 6>there's a need for approval from the </v>
<v Speaker 6>tribe.</v>

599
00:25:22.271 --> 00:25:23.690
<v Speaker 6>There's the need for,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

600
00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:27.170
<v Speaker 6>sexually reproduce.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's the need to accomplish tasks,</v>

601
00:25:27.171 --> 00:25:31.600
<v Speaker 6>has a need to avoid probation,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and we have all these reward systems,</v>

602
00:25:31.601 --> 00:25:34.150
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Where like your body and your,</v>

603
00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:35.133
<v Speaker 6>your,</v>
<v Speaker 6>your organism will reward you with a </v>

604
00:25:37.721 --> 00:25:38.554
<v Speaker 6>positive feeling for reinforcing some of</v>
<v Speaker 6>the patterns of behavior that are </v>

605
00:25:42.281 --> 00:25:44.080
<v Speaker 6>necessary for survival.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

606
00:25:44.081 --> 00:25:46.780
<v Speaker 6>Like the ability to run away from </v>
<v Speaker 6>something when you're scared,</v>

607
00:25:46.781 --> 00:25:50.530
<v Speaker 6>when you get scared and you freak out </v>
<v Speaker 6>that as a jolt of Goji juice,</v>

608
00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:52.870
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You'll buy that Geico insurance.</v>

609
00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:53.793
<v Speaker 6>Fuck you ready to run man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Have you ever been like legitimately </v>

610
00:25:55.901 --> 00:25:57.520
<v Speaker 6>scared for your life and have that </v>
<v Speaker 6>feeling?</v>

611
00:25:57.521 --> 00:25:58.810
<v Speaker 6>Fuck yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's terrible.</v>

612
00:25:58.830 --> 00:25:59.300
<v Speaker 5>Fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

613
00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:01.580
<v Speaker 5>And that's more powerful than,</v>
<v Speaker 5>than desire.</v>

614
00:26:01.581 --> 00:26:02.414
<v Speaker 5>And I think that's one thing we're </v>
<v Speaker 5>facing right now as a society because </v>

615
00:26:04.071 --> 00:26:09.071
<v Speaker 5>it's just planes of Africa running from </v>
<v Speaker 5>a lion versus towards a banana.</v>

616
00:26:09.231 --> 00:26:11.150
<v Speaker 5>Like what's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's crazier?</v>

617
00:26:11.151 --> 00:26:11.984
<v Speaker 5>So I think that that's a way to </v>
<v Speaker 5>supercharge a population into buying a </v>

618
00:26:14.721 --> 00:26:15.554
<v Speaker 5>bunch of dumb shit.</v>

619
00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:16.503
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I still think this is a very important </v>

620
00:26:17.411 --> 00:26:18.244
<v Speaker 6>point that I think a lot of us it takes </v>
<v Speaker 6>a long time to realize is that these </v>

621
00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:24.460
<v Speaker 6>reward systems that we have set up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

622
00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:29.710
<v Speaker 6>Like these patterns that feel good to </v>
<v Speaker 6>follow through with like you know,</v>

623
00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:33.450
<v Speaker 6>the way we handle conflict and </v>
<v Speaker 6>especially at the d,</v>

624
00:26:33.451 --> 00:26:34.284
<v Speaker 6>the need to push yourself and stress </v>
<v Speaker 6>yourself out like some sort of physical </v>

625
00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:38.823
<v Speaker 6>exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've really feel like that those things </v>

626
00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:43.913
<v Speaker 6>like if you can help them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like if you could give them their fuel </v>

627
00:26:47.861 --> 00:26:48.694
<v Speaker 6>and a positive way,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you don't get any of the negative </v>

628
00:26:51.751 --> 00:26:52.584
<v Speaker 6>aspects of it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you get the positive aspects of it </v>

629
00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:57.690
<v Speaker 6>because like especially like the </v>
<v Speaker 6>physical one,</v>

630
00:26:57.880 --> 00:26:58.713
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I really believe this from my own </v>

631
00:27:00.181 --> 00:27:01.014
<v Speaker 6>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We all have physical requirements for </v>

632
00:27:03.121 --> 00:27:03.954
<v Speaker 6>movement and we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We don't give those physical </v>

633
00:27:06.841 --> 00:27:07.674
<v Speaker 6>requirements.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We don't feed the body correctly with </v>

634
00:27:09.121 --> 00:27:09.954
<v Speaker 6>those movements.</v>

635
00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:12.990
<v Speaker 6>And what happens is it gets angst and it</v>
<v Speaker 6>gets weird.</v>

636
00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:15.970
<v Speaker 6>Everybody gets freaked out and it starts</v>
<v Speaker 6>getting fat.</v>

637
00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:16.823
<v Speaker 6>It starts feeling like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And one of the reasons why it's not </v>

638
00:27:19.621 --> 00:27:20.454
<v Speaker 6>functioning right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's because we didn't properly manage </v>

639
00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:24.113
<v Speaker 6>movement,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like making sure your body is getting </v>

640
00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:27.023
<v Speaker 6>exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like put some stress on it so that it </v>

641
00:27:29.461 --> 00:27:32.760
<v Speaker 6>can recover and be stronger and maintain</v>
<v Speaker 6>a certain level of strength.</v>

642
00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:34.500
<v Speaker 6>Because if you don't put any stress on </v>
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>

643
00:27:34.501 --> 00:27:36.170
<v Speaker 6>it stops working and if it stops </v>
<v Speaker 6>working,</v>

644
00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:39.090
<v Speaker 6>you start your.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You start sagging and deteriorating.</v>

645
00:27:39.091 --> 00:27:41.610
<v Speaker 6>And here's the big one.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe you're an intellectual.</v>

646
00:27:41.611 --> 00:27:44.070
<v Speaker 6>Maybe you don't want to have anything to</v>
<v Speaker 6>do with physical stuff because you don't</v>

647
00:27:44.071 --> 00:27:44.904
<v Speaker 6>think you think of it as a base thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That fucking body has a giant influence </v>

648
00:27:49.081 --> 00:27:50.350
<v Speaker 6>on your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Eight apps,</v>

649
00:27:50.351 --> 00:27:52.290
<v Speaker 6>no separation.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's no separation.</v>

650
00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:53.153
<v Speaker 6>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and it is just a discipline issue and </v>

651
00:27:55.261 --> 00:27:56.580
<v Speaker 6>there's nothing else.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's.</v>

652
00:27:56.581 --> 00:27:58.110
<v Speaker 6>I'm not saying it should be a </v>
<v Speaker 6>bodybuilder.</v>

653
00:27:58.200 --> 00:27:59.033
<v Speaker 6>I'm not saying you should go out there </v>
<v Speaker 6>and fucking run marathons or do </v>

654
00:28:02.071 --> 00:28:04.020
<v Speaker 6>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Even the super stressful,</v>

655
00:28:04.021 --> 00:28:06.930
<v Speaker 6>but do some sit ups,</v>
<v Speaker 6>do some pushups,</v>

656
00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:09.000
<v Speaker 6>do some chin ups.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you can do some,</v>

657
00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:11.970
<v Speaker 6>some running up hills,</v>
<v Speaker 6>pickup some heavy stuff.</v>

658
00:28:11.971 --> 00:28:14.850
<v Speaker 6>Move it around and do it regularly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do it all the time.</v>

659
00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:18.360
<v Speaker 6>And do it even if you have no desire </v>
<v Speaker 6>whatsoever to look good naked,</v>

660
00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:21.870
<v Speaker 6>just do it to make your body last </v>
<v Speaker 6>longer.</v>

661
00:28:22.090 --> 00:28:24.160
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's natural anti depressant.</v>

662
00:28:24.161 --> 00:28:26.950
<v Speaker 1>Like I used to live in the Czech </v>
<v Speaker 1>Republic and there was no gems there.</v>

663
00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:28.063
<v Speaker 1>What we do in there studying history and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is no jams and I would have like </v>

664
00:28:32.051 --> 00:28:33.940
<v Speaker 1>a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't feel safe in certain areas,</v>

665
00:28:33.941 --> 00:28:38.080
<v Speaker 1>jogging because it was just intense so I</v>
<v Speaker 1>would just jump up and down.</v>

666
00:28:38.170 --> 00:28:41.410
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would play like disco or something and</v>

667
00:28:41.411 --> 00:28:44.110
<v Speaker 1>just manically jump up and down and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel awesome.</v>

668
00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:46.960
<v Speaker 1>I had this dumb idea once a few years </v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

669
00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:47.801
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

670
00:28:47.801 --> 00:28:51.490
<v Speaker 1>if you just jumped all the time and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>kept jumping,</v>

671
00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:53.890
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't you get better at trumping like</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't you?</v>

672
00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:54.783
<v Speaker 1>Like you get stronger and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a matter of like how many reps you </v>

673
00:28:56.831 --> 00:28:57.610
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't like.</v>

674
00:28:57.610 --> 00:29:01.690
<v Speaker 1>How high could you wind up jumping?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there a point of no return?</v>

675
00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:02.723
<v Speaker 1>Dude?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're telling to a six slash seven guy </v>

676
00:29:03.431 --> 00:29:04.264
<v Speaker 1>who can't dunk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's jumped a lot to try and get up </v>

677
00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:06.583
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

678
00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:10.000
<v Speaker 1>I think I can get really good at long </v>
<v Speaker 1>distance running,</v>

679
00:29:10.001 --> 00:29:14.140
<v Speaker 1>but I don't have the twitch to go up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've tried man.</v>

680
00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:17.530
<v Speaker 1>Well I feel like a cement potato.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't jump at all.</v>

681
00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:19.900
<v Speaker 1>I can't dunk for shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Married little ups.</v>

682
00:29:21.670 --> 00:29:25.780
<v Speaker 1>I could endure some video yesterday of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the highest jump I've ever seen by a guy</v>

683
00:29:25.781 --> 00:29:28.060
<v Speaker 1>that didn't look that tall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His top of his head.</v>

684
00:29:28.150 --> 00:29:28.530
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

685
00:29:28.530 --> 00:29:32.350
<v Speaker 1>the verticals thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had the top one that's unreal.</v>

686
00:29:32.351 --> 00:29:35.020
<v Speaker 1>Like mosquito eggs and spoke video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

687
00:29:35.021 --> 00:29:37.630
<v Speaker 1>I've saw this one dude that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>practicing on those.</v>

688
00:29:37.930 --> 00:29:39.010
<v Speaker 1>You ever see those?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

689
00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:41.540
<v Speaker 1>the Plyo bags,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're the</v>

690
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:43.023
<v Speaker 3>plyo boxes,</v>

00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:44.690
<v Speaker 3>It was the war of 18,</v>
<v Speaker 3>12.</v>

807
00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:45.830
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Civil war,</v>

808
00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:49.490
<v Speaker 3>I mean we're on a dollar a day and </v>
<v Speaker 3>today's money until like 1890.</v>

809
00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:51.260
<v Speaker 3>They were broke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

810
00:34:51.261 --> 00:34:54.200
<v Speaker 3>I mean my mom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>her parents had a dirt floor,</v>

811
00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:56.390
<v Speaker 3>dirt.</v>

812
00:34:56.390 --> 00:35:01.390
<v Speaker 3>My parents were born in America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but my grandparents came over to America</v>

813
00:35:02.421 --> 00:35:07.421
<v Speaker 3>from Italy when they were really young.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I think my grandpa was a before the</v>

814
00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:09.973
<v Speaker 3>teenage years and and he was telling me </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the brutality of life on a farm </v>

815
00:35:13.971 --> 00:35:16.010
<v Speaker 3>when you're poor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>during the depression,</v>

816
00:35:16.650 --> 00:35:17.483
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about how,</v>

817
00:35:17.590 --> 00:35:19.970
<v Speaker 3>how we learned to kill rabbits with his </v>
<v Speaker 3>bare hands,</v>

818
00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:20.973
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how you would explain to me a snapper </v>

819
00:35:22.370 --> 00:35:23.203
<v Speaker 3>rabbits snack and you're looking in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy's eyes that didn't know whether or </v>

820
00:35:25.791 --> 00:35:29.150
<v Speaker 3>not members of his family would starve </v>
<v Speaker 3>to death exactly like this.</v>

821
00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:31.100
<v Speaker 3>There was a different world back then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>

822
00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:32.540
<v Speaker 3>Stakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

823
00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:33.533
<v Speaker 3>No one's worried about pronouns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My grandfather was a very kind and </v>

824
00:35:36.141 --> 00:35:38.580
<v Speaker 3>gentle man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of belied</v>

825
00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:41.420
<v Speaker 6>like almost the rest of my family and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

826
00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:45.030
<v Speaker 6>and his,</v>
<v Speaker 6>his start in life because he,</v>

827
00:35:45.031 --> 00:35:47.160
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he was born during a very,</v>

828
00:35:47.161 --> 00:35:47.994
<v Speaker 6>very,</v>
<v Speaker 6>very difficult time and he was just a </v>

829
00:35:50.101 --> 00:35:52.890
<v Speaker 6>really kind demand who liked to read </v>
<v Speaker 6>books.</v>

830
00:35:52.891 --> 00:35:55.470
<v Speaker 6>He was like the gentle one of my family.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So cool.</v>

831
00:35:55.770 --> 00:35:57.870
<v Speaker 6>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I lived with him when I was a kid when I</v>

832
00:35:57.871 --> 00:35:58.704
<v Speaker 6>was just moving to New York when I had </v>
<v Speaker 6>to leave Boston and I got a manager and </v>

833
00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:05.193
<v Speaker 6>my manager lived in New York who I'm </v>
<v Speaker 6>still with this day and I was like </v>

834
00:36:08.701 --> 00:36:13.350
<v Speaker 6>barely out of the open mic days and um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I couldn't afford to live in New York by</v>

835
00:36:13.351 --> 00:36:14.730
<v Speaker 6>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I tried to figure it out,</v>

836
00:36:14.731 --> 00:36:15.564
<v Speaker 6>like how much money I had,</v>
<v Speaker 6>very little saved up and I basically </v>

837
00:36:19.261 --> 00:36:20.094
<v Speaker 6>just went to New York with my car and </v>
<v Speaker 6>some clothes and my grandpa let me stay </v>

838
00:36:22.591 --> 00:36:23.424
<v Speaker 6>at his place.</v>

839
00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:24.863
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was weird man because my grandmother </v>

840
00:36:26.191 --> 00:36:27.024
<v Speaker 6>was dying.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She had a stroke and they gave her 72 </v>

841
00:36:30.451 --> 00:36:33.490
<v Speaker 6>hours and she lived for 12 years.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Ice.</v>

842
00:36:33.870 --> 00:36:36.930
<v Speaker 6>They thought she was going to be dead.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That like you say your goodbyes,</v>

843
00:36:36.931 --> 00:36:39.460
<v Speaker 6>get the family to fly to her,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

844
00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:40.353
<v Speaker 6>she,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she had a bad aneurysm and she lived </v>

845
00:36:42.631 --> 00:36:43.750
<v Speaker 6>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's crazy.</v>

846
00:36:43.751 --> 00:36:44.584
<v Speaker 6>So your grandpa took care of her.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He took care of her and I was living </v>

847
00:36:46.321 --> 00:36:48.300
<v Speaker 6>with the two of them while that was </v>
<v Speaker 6>going on.</v>

848
00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:51.220
<v Speaker 6>So like while I was going as transition </v>
<v Speaker 6>in my life,</v>

849
00:36:51.221 --> 00:36:52.054
<v Speaker 6>like the most exciting thing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like literally that's ever happened to </v>

850
00:36:54.661 --> 00:36:55.494
<v Speaker 6>me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I get this real legit manager and I </v>

851
00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:01.770
<v Speaker 6>started thinking maybe I can actually do</v>
<v Speaker 6>this,</v>

852
00:37:01.830 --> 00:37:02.663
<v Speaker 6>like maybe I can actually be a comic </v>
<v Speaker 6>because when I was living in Boston I </v>

853
00:37:05.131 --> 00:37:09.240
<v Speaker 6>was doing all sorts of other jobs and it</v>
<v Speaker 6>was never like a professional.</v>

854
00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:10.073
<v Speaker 6>I never had a full.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like I never had enough work where I </v>

855
00:37:12.931 --> 00:37:15.960
<v Speaker 6>could 100 percent be a comic and I've </v>
<v Speaker 6>only been doing it for like three years.</v>

856
00:37:16.170 --> 00:37:17.220
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it was just grinding,</v>

857
00:37:17.221 --> 00:37:19.200
<v Speaker 6>constantly grinding,</v>
<v Speaker 6>doing a bunch of different day jobs.</v>

858
00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:21.630
<v Speaker 6>And so when this opportunity came,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>

859
00:37:21.631 --> 00:37:23.460
<v Speaker 6>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can't believe this is real.</v>

860
00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:27.690
<v Speaker 6>And as like my life was starting to go </v>
<v Speaker 6>into this crazy place,</v>

861
00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:28.703
<v Speaker 6>I spent a good solid three months,</v>
<v Speaker 6>maybe four living with my grandfather </v>

862
00:37:33.571 --> 00:37:36.780
<v Speaker 6>while my grandmother was dying and </v>
<v Speaker 6>that's where I live.</v>

863
00:37:36.781 --> 00:37:38.970
<v Speaker 6>So I'd come home with them and talk to </v>
<v Speaker 6>them all the time.</v>

864
00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:40.193
<v Speaker 6>And they lived in a neighborhood that </v>
<v Speaker 6>used to be a predominantly Italian </v>

865
00:37:41.911 --> 00:37:42.744
<v Speaker 6>American neighborhood in Newark.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But it deteriorated slowly but surely </v>

866
00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:52.440
<v Speaker 6>until it was like a really.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It went from a black people.</v>

867
00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:54.390
<v Speaker 6>It's just like they did a thing called </v>
<v Speaker 6>blockbusting.</v>

868
00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:55.840
<v Speaker 6>You ever heard that story?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know a blog post.</v>

869
00:37:56.700 --> 00:37:58.200
<v Speaker 6>They're trying to get them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

870
00:37:58.201 --> 00:38:00.930
<v Speaker 6>they're trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They did that where they would move into</v>

871
00:38:00.931 --> 00:38:04.350
<v Speaker 6>neighborhoods and I don't know whether </v>
<v Speaker 6>or not it was true or there was doing.</v>

872
00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:05.213
<v Speaker 6>They were doing it to capitalize on </v>
<v Speaker 6>something that was true or whether they </v>

873
00:38:07.381 --> 00:38:08.214
<v Speaker 6>instigated it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they would essentially go door to </v>

874
00:38:09.841 --> 00:38:11.970
<v Speaker 6>door and they would say black people are</v>
<v Speaker 6>moving in,</v>

875
00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:12.893
<v Speaker 6>sell your house now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And most of my grandparents families </v>

876
00:38:17.191 --> 00:38:19.890
<v Speaker 6>around them sold their house.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And my grandfather was like,</v>

877
00:38:20.190 --> 00:38:21.630
<v Speaker 6>I like black people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fuck off.</v>

878
00:38:21.730 --> 00:38:24.600
<v Speaker 6>Literally just shut his door.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's awesome.</v>

879
00:38:24.601 --> 00:38:25.434
<v Speaker 6>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Grandfather was one of those guys as </v>

880
00:38:26.371 --> 00:38:28.980
<v Speaker 6>long as he has a gate and there's a lock</v>
<v Speaker 6>on the gate,</v>

881
00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:31.490
<v Speaker 6>like everything's good in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And he,</v>

882
00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:32.383
<v Speaker 6>he had like.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So when I would visit him like he had </v>

883
00:38:34.321 --> 00:38:36.040
<v Speaker 6>neighbors,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like the next door neighbor right</v>

884
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:38.500
<v Speaker 1>next door got arrested for selling </v>
<v Speaker 1>crack.</v>

885
00:38:38.690 --> 00:38:40.840
<v Speaker 1>This kid had an audi parked in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>driveway.</v>

886
00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:42.730
<v Speaker 1>They broke through his house with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>battering ram.</v>

887
00:38:42.731 --> 00:38:46.840
<v Speaker 1>That was like right before I moved in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is awesome,</v>

888
00:38:46.841 --> 00:38:47.621
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

889
00:38:47.621 --> 00:38:48.454
<v Speaker 1>But I was watching their transition to </v>
<v Speaker 1>death essentially in my transition to </v>

890
00:38:54.011 --> 00:38:56.380
<v Speaker 1>life at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

891
00:38:56.381 --> 00:38:59.770
<v Speaker 1>I'd tell them somewhat similar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that that's to me right now,</v>

892
00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:02.080
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so profound because like now that</v>

893
00:39:02.081 --> 00:39:02.914
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a family and thinking about my </v>

894
00:39:03.761 --> 00:39:05.800
<v Speaker 1>wife and he watched the notebook and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

895
00:39:05.801 --> 00:39:07.180
<v Speaker 1>oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>

896
00:39:07.450 --> 00:39:10.600
<v Speaker 1>my best friend died on my birthday that </v>
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

897
00:39:10.601 --> 00:39:11.434
<v Speaker 1>I was out here a snowboarding and it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>right as I got like punk and the show </v>

898
00:39:15.410 --> 00:39:17.620
<v Speaker 1>punked and he like is the one who got me</v>
<v Speaker 1>into standup.</v>

899
00:39:17.621 --> 00:39:20.160
<v Speaker 1>And it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was so bittersweet,</v>

900
00:39:20.170 --> 00:39:21.040
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

901
00:39:21.041 --> 00:39:26.041
<v Speaker 1>it was like the fragility of life as </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're given this weird ego shot.</v>

902
00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:29.380
<v Speaker 1>Just just was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was so intense.</v>

903
00:39:29.890 --> 00:39:31.720
<v Speaker 1>A good friend of mine died of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>overdose.</v>

904
00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:34.210
<v Speaker 1>Same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Died of an overdose.</v>

905
00:39:34.211 --> 00:39:34.960
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

906
00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:35.793
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't say I was out here maybe three </v>

907
00:39:39.551 --> 00:39:42.790
<v Speaker 1>or four years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He died maybe five at the most.</v>

908
00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:46.450
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spent New Year's Eve,</v>

909
00:39:47.350 --> 00:39:48.183
<v Speaker 1>y two k on the phone with him because we</v>
<v Speaker 1>were wondering whether or not the world </v>

910
00:39:51.881 --> 00:39:52.714
<v Speaker 1>will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then we were just having fun laughing </v>

911
00:39:57.850 --> 00:39:58.683
<v Speaker 1>and then he died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He died of a drug overdose and I found </v>

912
00:40:01.451 --> 00:40:02.284
<v Speaker 1>out about it like secondhand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody found out about it through </v>

913
00:40:04.391 --> 00:40:07.480
<v Speaker 1>somebody else and they called me up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they asked me if I heard and I said,</v>

914
00:40:07.481 --> 00:40:09.880
<v Speaker 1>what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you sure?</v>

915
00:40:09.881 --> 00:40:10.361
<v Speaker 1>And they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

916
00:40:10.361 --> 00:40:12.160
<v Speaker 1>They found his body in a hotel room and </v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

917
00:40:12.250 --> 00:40:17.250
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on real rough.</v>

918
00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:18.213
<v Speaker 1>It was rough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the hardest one next to my </v>

919
00:40:20.711 --> 00:40:21.544
<v Speaker 1>grandpa.</v>

920
00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:23.800
<v Speaker 1>Those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the hardest one.</v>

921
00:40:24.090 --> 00:40:24.923
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Phil Hartman was pretty God damn hard </v>

922
00:40:26.441 --> 00:40:27.700
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a hard one.</v>

923
00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:30.770
<v Speaker 1>That was a hard one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I recently lost a,</v>

924
00:40:30.771 --> 00:40:33.460
<v Speaker 1>got a heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a vet and it was like,</v>

925
00:40:33.690 --> 00:40:34.523
<v Speaker 1>and you saw it coming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was tragic because his ptsd was </v>

926
00:40:37.961 --> 00:40:39.370
<v Speaker 1>so bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was like,</v>

927
00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:40.980
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The story was a,</v>

928
00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:43.900
<v Speaker 1>he was a d one baseball player at </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything going for him.</v>

929
00:40:43.901 --> 00:40:46.750
<v Speaker 1>His Dad dies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wants to join the marines.</v>

930
00:40:46.751 --> 00:40:49.690
<v Speaker 1>He's unbelievable at being a sniper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

931
00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:52.870
<v Speaker 1>they go through how in Afghanistan he </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets on heroin,</v>

932
00:40:52.871 --> 00:40:53.704
<v Speaker 1>ends up in my town,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we become like best friends with my </v>

933
00:40:55.661 --> 00:40:58.570
<v Speaker 1>brother because like a lot of vets want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do tree work because they need that.</v>

934
00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:00.370
<v Speaker 1>Every man needs a purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

935
00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:04.450
<v Speaker 1>and it's like a lack of purpose for like</v>
<v Speaker 1>true warrior hero types,</v>

936
00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:05.313
<v Speaker 1>his death and so like that extreme </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature of climbing up trees and hauling </v>

937
00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:11.270
<v Speaker 1>lumber and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd all do it together.</v>

938
00:41:11.271 --> 00:41:12.104
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what I also like comedy </v>

939
00:41:12.941 --> 00:41:14.140
<v Speaker 1>because the honesty of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

940
00:41:14.141 --> 00:41:14.974
<v Speaker 1>the dude shot tons and tons of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like that feeling of constant </v>

941
00:41:18.671 --> 00:41:19.504
<v Speaker 1>judgment and guilt and pride and guilt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Comedy was like a relief for him and </v>

942
00:41:22.961 --> 00:41:25.150
<v Speaker 1>then he just died of heroin man and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

943
00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:26.433
<v Speaker 1>you get the this because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got him a gym membership and all this </v>

944
00:41:28.811 --> 00:41:31.900
<v Speaker 1>shit and we were all like rooting for </v>
<v Speaker 1>him because he's this beautiful man.</v>

945
00:41:31.901 --> 00:41:34.340
<v Speaker 1>But like there's just a moral injuries</v>

946
00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:36.020
<v Speaker 3>that just can take a toll.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was,</v>

947
00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:37.820
<v Speaker 3>that was brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

948
00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:38.673
<v Speaker 3>There's some injuries of the mind that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are probably more devastating injuries </v>

949
00:41:41.811 --> 00:41:43.520
<v Speaker 3>to the body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

950
00:41:43.521 --> 00:41:44.354
<v Speaker 3>and I think that's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the things that we </v>

951
00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:49.520
<v Speaker 3>overlook,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we can't see.</v>

952
00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:51.410
<v Speaker 3>We think about what we can see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

953
00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:53.120
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy got shot in the shoulder,</v>

954
00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:55.130
<v Speaker 3>but we don't look at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

955
00:41:55.180 --> 00:41:58.650
<v Speaker 3>and watch 10 people die in a fire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

956
00:41:58.651 --> 00:42:00.950
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't think of that as an injury.</v>

957
00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:02.790
<v Speaker 3>But I mean think about like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

958
00:42:02.850 --> 00:42:05.600
<v Speaker 3>I've had some friends that were </v>
<v Speaker 3>paramedics and they'll tell you like,</v>

959
00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:06.853
<v Speaker 3>accents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They roll up on suicides that they roll </v>

960
00:42:08.931 --> 00:42:13.580
<v Speaker 3>up on and just after awhile you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

961
00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:14.473
<v Speaker 3>you feel so vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things that he said is </v>

962
00:42:16.251 --> 00:42:17.084
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people that do that work or </v>

963
00:42:18.951 --> 00:42:23.600
<v Speaker 3>like a very sexually promiscuous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just don't give a fuck.</v>

964
00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:24.493
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they also want to develop the </v>

965
00:42:25.770 --> 00:42:27.590
<v Speaker 3>develop dark humor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gallows humor,</v>

966
00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:28.611
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

967
00:42:28.611 --> 00:42:29.444
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my buddy quinn from the impractical </v>

968
00:42:30.621 --> 00:42:32.570
<v Speaker 3>jokers used to be a New York City </v>
<v Speaker 3>firefighter.</v>

969
00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:35.540
<v Speaker 3>And so we did one of my podcasts </v>
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>

970
00:42:35.541 --> 00:42:37.310
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've been friends since my space.</v>

971
00:42:37.311 --> 00:42:38.260
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these guys are salted,</v>

972
00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:40.640
<v Speaker 3>the earth man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're the fucking greatest dude's like</v>

973
00:42:40.641 --> 00:42:41.474
<v Speaker 3>great statements.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like say we've been friends since my </v>

974
00:42:43.230 --> 00:42:44.063
<v Speaker 3>budget.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We used to write each other about our </v>

975
00:42:45.051 --> 00:42:49.460
<v Speaker 3>sketches and shit and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that dude is seeing just kids torched,</v>

976
00:42:49.461 --> 00:42:49.911
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

977
00:42:49.911 --> 00:42:51.730
<v Speaker 3>and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they had to joke about it.</v>

978
00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:52.573
<v Speaker 3>If not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to just blow your brains </v>

979
00:42:53.391 --> 00:42:54.170
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah.</v>

980
00:42:54.170 --> 00:42:55.670
<v Speaker 3>And then you come home to your own </v>
<v Speaker 3>family,</v>

981
00:42:55.671 --> 00:42:56.910
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

982
00:42:56.920 --> 00:42:59.000
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at England after World War Two.</v>

983
00:42:59.001 --> 00:42:59.631
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

984
00:42:59.631 --> 00:43:01.730
<v Speaker 3>I think that's what spawned so much </v>
<v Speaker 3>great music.</v>

985
00:43:01.731 --> 00:43:02.840
<v Speaker 3>Some great art is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

986
00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:03.973
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their dads all died man and it's like </v>

987
00:43:05.690 --> 00:43:06.523
<v Speaker 3>for their cities are getting bombed and </v>
<v Speaker 3>out of that comes this like desire to </v>

988
00:43:10.581 --> 00:43:11.414
<v Speaker 3>live in the moment and to just be able </v>
<v Speaker 3>to say and do whatever the fuck you can </v>

989
00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:15.110
<v Speaker 3>before you die.</v>

990
00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:16.213
<v Speaker 3>I think you're totally right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the case with Roman art </v>

991
00:43:18.711 --> 00:43:19.544
<v Speaker 3>as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

992
00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:22.850
<v Speaker 3>I mean why is there so much artistic </v>
<v Speaker 3>expression back then?</v>

993
00:43:22.870 --> 00:43:23.703
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why were people so determined to put </v>

994
00:43:25.641 --> 00:43:26.474
<v Speaker 3>their emotions down on campus?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those emotions were like hurricane </v>

995
00:43:29.781 --> 00:43:32.990
<v Speaker 3>swirling in your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>visions of people getting cut in half by</v>

996
00:43:32.991 --> 00:43:33.824
<v Speaker 3>swords and arrows piercing sternums </v>
<v Speaker 3>choking to death on their own blood and </v>

997
00:43:39.621 --> 00:43:43.400
<v Speaker 3>fucking hordes of barbarians coming over</v>
<v Speaker 3>the top of the hill with the horses,</v>

998
00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:46.640
<v Speaker 3>swinging axes like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa,</v>

999
00:43:46.641 --> 00:43:50.720
<v Speaker 3>that was real shit back then know </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone with a blue check mark is mad at</v>

1000
00:43:50.721 --> 00:43:51.840
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

1001
00:43:51.841 --> 00:43:54.970
<v Speaker 3>then people are just getting their heads</v>
<v Speaker 3>chopped off and you know,</v>

1002
00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:55.813
<v Speaker 3>I've been thinking about this a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>lately with this Kevin Spacey thing is </v>

1003
00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:04.700
<v Speaker 3>that pedophilia is horrific.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We all agree it's.</v>

1004
00:44:04.750 --> 00:44:06.490
<v Speaker 3>It's terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1005
00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:07.343
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so devastating because as we were </v>

1006
00:44:09.231 --> 00:44:10.880
<v Speaker 3>talking about before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if someone gets shot,</v>

1007
00:44:11.210 --> 00:44:12.290
<v Speaker 3>you could see the wound.</v>

1008
00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:17.650
<v Speaker 3>If someone gets raped by an act or when </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're 12 years old,</v>

1009
00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:20.040
<v Speaker 3>like how do you fix that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1010
00:44:20.110 --> 00:44:21.080
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is that?</v>

1011
00:44:21.081 --> 00:44:21.914
<v Speaker 3>What kind of psychic wound is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what I was thinking is it's really </v>

1012
00:44:25.371 --> 00:44:26.204
<v Speaker 3>fascinating to me that we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we pretty much acknowledged that </v>

1013
00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:35.320
<v Speaker 3>pederasts were commonplace in the 15th </v>
<v Speaker 3>century,</v>

1014
00:44:36.030 --> 00:44:38.310
<v Speaker 3>the Twelfth Century,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the 13th century,</v>

1015
00:44:38.311 --> 00:44:41.010
<v Speaker 3>the 14th century,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this way,</v>

1016
00:44:41.011 --> 00:44:41.844
<v Speaker 3>way into the 18 hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when you go with the Catholic </v>

1017
00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:46.103
<v Speaker 3>Church,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it is,</v>

1018
00:44:46.650 --> 00:44:47.483
<v Speaker 3>if you're a Catholic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you shut your fucking iphone off right </v>

1019
00:44:49.801 --> 00:44:51.210
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1020
00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:54.240
<v Speaker 3>Nobody raised Catholic and that was as </v>
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

1021
00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:58.440
<v Speaker 3>Don't get your panties in a bundle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is a religion built on kid fucking.</v>

1022
00:44:59.580 --> 00:45:00.413
<v Speaker 3>It is a religion dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all about as a giant history of </v>

1023
00:45:02.821 --> 00:45:03.910
<v Speaker 3>that and it's because they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1024
00:45:04.110 --> 00:45:04.943
<v Speaker 3>they wouldn't let the priests have </v>
<v Speaker 3>families based on land ownership and </v>

1025
00:45:07.951 --> 00:45:12.840
<v Speaker 3>some of these moves can take a beautiful</v>
<v Speaker 3>religion and make it really dark.</v>

1026
00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:15.690
<v Speaker 3>And there was more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't just that they didn't let him,</v>

1027
00:45:15.691 --> 00:45:18.870
<v Speaker 3>they didn't want to fuck women because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were a God damn rock stars.</v>

1028
00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:23.600
<v Speaker 3>The guys who held the Bible and could </v>
<v Speaker 3>lead literally read it right?</v>

1029
00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:27.480
<v Speaker 3>The average person could relax.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're all reading German and all these</v>

1030
00:45:27.481 --> 00:45:28.440
<v Speaker 3>different languages.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't.</v>

1031
00:45:28.441 --> 00:45:29.274
<v Speaker 3>Martin Luther.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever heard the prophets of </v>

1032
00:45:30.861 --> 00:45:31.600
<v Speaker 3>doom?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1033
00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:34.680
<v Speaker 3>Prophets of doom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dan Carlin is one of my favorite fucking</v>

1034
00:45:34.681 --> 00:45:37.320
<v Speaker 3>human beings and several lived and his </v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast.</v>

1035
00:45:37.321 --> 00:45:38.154
<v Speaker 3>Hardcore history is a national treasure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I've learned more about history </v>

1036
00:45:41.521 --> 00:45:46.521
<v Speaker 3>and more about like the mon goals and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>World War II and fucking everything,</v>

1037
00:45:47.370 --> 00:45:50.640
<v Speaker 3>but his podcast on Martin Luther and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>trend,</v>

1038
00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:51.503
<v Speaker 3>the first literal translations of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Bible that regular common folk could </v>

1039
00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:56.460
<v Speaker 3>read who've lost their minds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

1040
00:45:56.461 --> 00:45:57.294
<v Speaker 3>Jesus was poor too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guys dependent wars killed hundreds of </v>

1041
00:46:00.631 --> 00:46:01.470
<v Speaker 3>thousands of people.</v>

1042
00:46:01.850 --> 00:46:06.300
<v Speaker 3>Imagine a world folks were until.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was it like the 15 hundreds?</v>

1043
00:46:06.340 --> 00:46:07.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mid fifties.</v>

1044
00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:10.910
<v Speaker 3>It was round Gutenberg,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that was like a 15 hundreds,</v>

1045
00:46:11.210 --> 00:46:15.420
<v Speaker 3>mid 15 Sinai when Martin Luther was 95 </v>
<v Speaker 3>theses in deck,</v>

1046
00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:20.460
<v Speaker 3>but the bottom line is what he had done </v>
<v Speaker 3>was translate the Bible.</v>

1047
00:46:20.461 --> 00:46:21.294
<v Speaker 3>He Slang.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of Dick guarantee wasn't doing </v>

1048
00:46:22.711 --> 00:46:27.711
<v Speaker 3>this because he just wanted people to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>free to October 31st,</v>

1049
00:46:27.901 --> 00:46:29.250
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Jesus Christ.</v>

1050
00:46:29.251 --> 00:46:31.680
<v Speaker 3>It was yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is crazy.</v>

1051
00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:32.653
<v Speaker 3>Did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was after US sober October 500 years </v>

1052
00:46:34.771 --> 00:46:35.251
<v Speaker 3>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By the way.</v>

1053
00:46:35.251 --> 00:46:37.410
<v Speaker 3>I'm feeling a toasty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel so good right now.</v>

1054
00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:38.940
<v Speaker 3>Filled right back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was worried,</v>

1055
00:46:38.970 --> 00:46:41.430
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was worried that if I smoked a joint,</v>

1056
00:46:41.431 --> 00:46:43.080
<v Speaker 3>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>

1057
00:46:43.081 --> 00:46:47.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Die a worm of paranoia.</v>

1058
00:46:47.550 --> 00:46:49.400
<v Speaker 3>Thinking about girls,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I figured in high school,</v>

1059
00:46:50.820 --> 00:46:52.590
<v Speaker 3>for me it's the adipose man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>

1060
00:46:52.591 --> 00:46:55.680
<v Speaker 3>I don't smoke every now and that if like</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's someone I trust,</v>

1061
00:46:55.681 --> 00:46:58.190
<v Speaker 3>I know as good we will like Seattle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seattle's that.</v>

1062
00:46:58.200 --> 00:46:59.970
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is just flesh,</v>

1063
00:47:00.210 --> 00:47:02.350
<v Speaker 3>but that should make,</v>
<v Speaker 3>makes me like real.</v>

1064
00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:06.050
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so this was the 15 hundreds,</v>

1065
00:47:06.051 --> 00:47:08.280
<v Speaker 3>15,</v>
<v Speaker 3>15 is I would just a 15,</v>

1066
00:47:08.281 --> 00:47:09.114
<v Speaker 3>17.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So think about that like before then </v>

1067
00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:13.013
<v Speaker 3>that we're only talking that we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>literally only talking about 500 years </v>

1068
00:47:16.651 --> 00:47:17.400
<v Speaker 3>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1069
00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:20.700
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the last information overload.</v>

1070
00:47:20.730 --> 00:47:21.563
<v Speaker 3>So think about 500 years in terms of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>life of the human species is mere of </v>

1071
00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:27.593
<v Speaker 3>mere blip and one of the reasons why the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Catholic Church was able to get away </v>

1072
00:47:30.671 --> 00:47:31.504
<v Speaker 3>with just translating things to people </v>
<v Speaker 3>where they couldn't read it is because </v>

1073
00:47:34.181 --> 00:47:38.680
<v Speaker 3>that's how fucking everybody did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They all did it that way.</v>

1074
00:47:38.890 --> 00:47:39.723
<v Speaker 3>You would go to some place and some guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>would tell you what the sacred stuff </v>

1075
00:47:42.641 --> 00:47:43.720
<v Speaker 3>would be and you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1076
00:47:43.721 --> 00:47:44.554
<v Speaker 3>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how many people actually got ahold </v>

1077
00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:49.720
<v Speaker 3>of it and read it all day and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and studied it.</v>

1078
00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:50.553
<v Speaker 3>And made sure there was no </v>
<v Speaker 3>contradictions is why is this guy keep </v>

1079
00:47:52.391 --> 00:47:55.960
<v Speaker 3>fucking my wife Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Catholics were like the buzzfeed.</v>

1080
00:47:56.620 --> 00:47:59.440
<v Speaker 3>They were banging everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guarantee you they had money.</v>

1081
00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:01.340
<v Speaker 3>They were allowed to have wives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1082
00:48:01.390 --> 00:48:04.060
<v Speaker 3>do you know that like early Pope's ran </v>
<v Speaker 3>armies?</v>

1083
00:48:04.090 --> 00:48:04.923
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did.</v>

1084
00:48:04.930 --> 00:48:05.763
<v Speaker 3>They were nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had to go to France for a little </v>

1085
00:48:07.211 --> 00:48:08.520
<v Speaker 3>while to like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1086
00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:13.710
<v Speaker 3>because had so much heat on them because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's what it fused with constantly.</v>

1087
00:48:16.341 --> 00:48:17.174
<v Speaker 3>It's when a fused with the Roman empire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got that Empire Shit because </v>

1088
00:48:19.001 --> 00:48:19.834
<v Speaker 3>Christianity is a beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Religion is more like mellow and </v>

1089
00:48:22.061 --> 00:48:22.890
<v Speaker 3>peaceful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1090
00:48:22.890 --> 00:48:24.870
<v Speaker 3>and then you got constantine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1091
00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:25.773
<v Speaker 3>the Roman Empire is falling apart and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they wanted to get more favor of the </v>

1092
00:48:28.731 --> 00:48:29.564
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they just fuse the two together and </v>

1093
00:48:30.731 --> 00:48:32.200
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1094
00:48:32.201 --> 00:48:34.930
<v Speaker 3>they got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pope's gone crazy.</v>

1095
00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:36.673
<v Speaker 3>They ran armies.</v>

1096
00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:38.770
<v Speaker 3>That was one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened.</v>

1097
00:48:38.771 --> 00:48:42.160
<v Speaker 3>Apparently there was a conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope I'm not fucking this up.</v>

1098
00:48:42.610 --> 00:48:43.443
<v Speaker 3>It was from hardcore history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a conflict where one of the </v>

1099
00:48:46.301 --> 00:48:50.000
<v Speaker 3>earlier pope's didn't want to send </v>
<v Speaker 3>troops to fight gang is con,</v>

1100
00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:51.453
<v Speaker 3>like there was a lot of confusion in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>early days of getting his con because </v>

1101
00:48:54.221 --> 00:48:55.740
<v Speaker 3>before getting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Goddammit,</v>

1102
00:48:56.620 --> 00:48:58.690
<v Speaker 3>I've said it in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you heard it in the past,</v>

1103
00:48:58.691 --> 00:49:01.510
<v Speaker 3>I apologize for repeating myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the wrath of Khan,</v>

1104
00:49:01.540 --> 00:49:05.500
<v Speaker 3>wrath of the con series of Dan Carlin </v>
<v Speaker 3>Sunrail streaks on real.</v>

1105
00:49:05.501 --> 00:49:10.501
<v Speaker 3>One of my favorite pieces of work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's a comedy,</v>

1106
00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:13.780
<v Speaker 3>a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of my favorite creations ever.</v>

1107
00:49:13.930 --> 00:49:15.190
<v Speaker 3>It's unreal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>

1108
00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:18.730
<v Speaker 3>It literally changed my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like I got like a Harvard education</v>

1109
00:49:18.910 --> 00:49:22.450
<v Speaker 3>after paying for a state education for </v>
<v Speaker 3>free.</v>

1110
00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:26.860
<v Speaker 3>I know that in the game and then if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to get the wrath of the cons,</v>

1111
00:49:26.861 --> 00:49:28.600
<v Speaker 3>you could just buy it on itunes.</v>

1112
00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:30.070
<v Speaker 3>It's a dollar a show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

1113
00:49:30.071 --> 00:49:33.250
<v Speaker 3>It's so worth it and I think it's like </v>
<v Speaker 3>each one of them is at least an hour and</v>

1114
00:49:33.251 --> 00:49:33.960
<v Speaker 3>a half long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1115
00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:38.060
<v Speaker 3>some are five.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The blitz or sick to get all of them.</v>

1116
00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:38.913
<v Speaker 3>The whole series,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1117
00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:39.753
<v Speaker 3>The series is fine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not an individual podcast like the </v>

1118
00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:43.093
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>recent blitz a was over five about </v>

1119
00:49:44.861 --> 00:49:47.080
<v Speaker 3>nuclear war and the whole podcast by </v>
<v Speaker 3>itself is fine,</v>

1120
00:49:47.100 --> 00:49:48.960
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then he just had the Gothic,</v>

1121
00:49:49.020 --> 00:49:51.760
<v Speaker 3>a genocide of the gothic Holocaust.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was another fiber.</v>

1122
00:49:51.970 --> 00:49:53.200
<v Speaker 3>So gangster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he,</v>

1123
00:49:53.201 --> 00:49:55.060
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he does this whole himself folks.</v>

1124
00:49:55.090 --> 00:49:55.923
<v Speaker 3>He edits it all himself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was like that dollar is so worth </v>

1125
00:49:57.881 --> 00:49:58.714
<v Speaker 3>it and in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like one of the most people just </v>

1126
00:50:01.541 --> 00:50:02.610
<v Speaker 3>don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1127
00:50:02.620 --> 00:50:03.453
<v Speaker 3>you're not hearing about this on CNN,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you not hear about this on Fox News and </v>

1128
00:50:06.491 --> 00:50:08.020
<v Speaker 3>it is a travesty.</v>

1129
00:50:08.050 --> 00:50:08.883
<v Speaker 3>It is one of the best ways for you to </v>
<v Speaker 3>learn about history because you learn </v>

1130
00:50:11.861 --> 00:50:14.710
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He gives you a broad,</v>

1131
00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:15.753
<v Speaker 3>detailed sense of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He does it in a very entertaining way </v>

1132
00:50:18.881 --> 00:50:22.840
<v Speaker 3>that you want to keep tuning in and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>those memories stick to your brain.</v>

1133
00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:24.633
<v Speaker 3>There's an art to saying things </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting and he has that old whole </v>

1134
00:50:27.951 --> 00:50:30.490
<v Speaker 3>series for 10 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so worth it.</v>

1135
00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:33.100
<v Speaker 3>That one and a half beers guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's so worth it.</v>

1136
00:50:33.220 --> 00:50:35.480
<v Speaker 3>Whereas that is website Dan Carlin Doc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 3>it on itunes and it'll go straight to </v>

1141

<v Speaker 3>your podcasts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1142
00:50:47.451 --> 00:50:49.820

<v Speaker 3>oster front.</v>

1143
00:50:49.860 --> 00:50:50.840
<v Speaker 3>Mm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>

<v Speaker 3>almost like the joker where he keeps </v>

1145

<v Speaker 3>hitting you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like what is a monument of?</v>

<v Speaker 3>entertainment information and humility.</v>

1171
00:51:59.661 --> 00:52:01.580
<v Speaker 3>at all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is why people will say,</v>

1172
00:52:01.581 --> 00:52:04.910
<v Speaker 3>and the Roman gods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they all talk to each other.</v>

1173
00:52:05.300 --> 00:52:06.133
<v Speaker 3>We were kind of wig red around that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's stunning to me that what we </v>

1174
00:52:09.681 --> 00:52:13.430
<v Speaker 3>were originally talking about was like </v>
<v Speaker 3>how common being a pedophile was.</v>

1175
00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:14.513
<v Speaker 3>He was like super common.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That until there is history on fire </v>

1176
00:52:18.550 --> 00:52:23.060
<v Speaker 3>profess or about spartacus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>spudding kids.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1179
00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:28.153
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing how recent it was where </v>

1180
00:52:31.251 --> 00:52:32.810
<v Speaker 3>that was taboo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you weren't,</v>

1181
00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:33.710
<v Speaker 3>where people like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1182
00:52:33.890 --> 00:52:35.200
<v Speaker 3>maybe we should stop fucking kids.</v>

1183
00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:36.410
<v Speaker 3>That's my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's my one.</v>

1184
00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:37.393
<v Speaker 3>Like I have a few rules in life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the number one is don't fuck the </v>

1185
00:52:40.431 --> 00:52:41.111
<v Speaker 3>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1186
00:52:41.111 --> 00:52:42.500
<v Speaker 3>it's 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Number one,</v>

1187
00:52:42.501 --> 00:52:45.150
<v Speaker 3>don't hurt the children.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't hurt the children are physically.</v>

1188
00:52:45.151 --> 00:52:46.970
<v Speaker 3>Don't hurt them sexually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't hurt him mentally.</v>

1189
00:52:47.270 --> 00:52:48.620
<v Speaker 3>Don't hurt the kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's number one.</v>

1190
00:52:48.621 --> 00:52:49.454
<v Speaker 3>Feed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Protect and teach what you are is the </v>

1191
00:52:52.810 --> 00:52:53.643
<v Speaker 3>result of some crazy shit that happened </v>
<v Speaker 3>to you and some awesome shit that </v>

1192
00:52:56.331 --> 00:52:57.164
<v Speaker 3>happened to you and your ability to </v>
<v Speaker 3>manage that fucking the land in between </v>

1193
00:53:01.071 --> 00:53:02.680
<v Speaker 3>the two that causes depression.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1194
00:53:02.690 --> 00:53:03.740
<v Speaker 3>Between chaos and order.</v>

1195
00:53:07.270 --> 00:53:10.200
<v Speaker 3>Law and order.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1196
00:53:11.060 --> 00:53:11.893
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's what our job is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is to figure out a way to make the best </v>

1197
00:53:15.141 --> 00:53:18.650
<v Speaker 3>people we can and raise those people so </v>
<v Speaker 3>that those people are going to impact as</v>

1198
00:53:18.651 --> 00:53:20.270
<v Speaker 3>many people as they can in a positive </v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

1199
00:53:20.540 --> 00:53:22.310
<v Speaker 3>And if this can be done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1200
00:53:22.340 --> 00:53:23.870
<v Speaker 3>you got to realize that the people of </v>
<v Speaker 3>today,</v>

1201
00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:25.113
<v Speaker 3>we're were basically biologically the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same as the people that live in the </v>

1202
00:53:29.041 --> 00:53:29.874
<v Speaker 3>gangs con days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we couldn't be further apart in </v>

1203
00:53:31.861 --> 00:53:34.470
<v Speaker 3>terms of the way we look at the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's our software programming.</v>

1204
00:53:34.530 --> 00:53:35.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

1205
00:53:35.671 --> 00:53:38.520
<v Speaker 3>Think about how you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how Jamie is her,</v>

1206
00:53:38.521 --> 00:53:39.354
<v Speaker 3>most of the people we know are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then think about getting his cons </v>

1207
00:53:41.431 --> 00:53:45.060
<v Speaker 3>mob of savages that were just eating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are like,</v>

1208
00:53:45.061 --> 00:53:45.894
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Syria.</v>

1209
00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:47.790
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Carlin gets into that.</v>

1210
00:53:47.791 --> 00:53:49.620
<v Speaker 3>It's a judgement at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at Nineveh,</v>

1211
00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:50.553
<v Speaker 3>it's like these people were like public </v>
<v Speaker 3>scannings and burnings and because it </v>

1212
00:53:54.781 --> 00:53:55.614
<v Speaker 3>was just all about just the yoke of </v>
<v Speaker 3>oppression in your life was just pain </v>

1213
00:54:01.141 --> 00:54:03.510
<v Speaker 3>and you wanted to inflict that pain on </v>
<v Speaker 3>other people.</v>

1214
00:54:03.620 --> 00:54:05.610
<v Speaker 3>So you agreed to like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was like,</v>

1215
00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:06.473
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's like almost like a sort of an </v>

1216
00:54:09.150 --> 00:54:14.150
<v Speaker 3>evolutionary basis and staying as close </v>
<v Speaker 3>to people as you can while agreeing with</v>

1217
00:54:16.291 --> 00:54:18.510
<v Speaker 3>his little evidence as possible to </v>
<v Speaker 3>murder them all.</v>

1218
00:54:19.380 --> 00:54:20.213
<v Speaker 3>Just like we're like witch trials.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things that freaked me </v>

1219
00:54:23.941 --> 00:54:24.774
<v Speaker 3>out about Dan Carlin's history of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mongols thing was he started talking </v>

1220
00:54:28.111 --> 00:54:33.111
<v Speaker 3>about how there's speculation that </v>
<v Speaker 3>decimation like the term decimation came</v>

1221
00:54:33.991 --> 00:54:36.390
<v Speaker 3>from like a 100.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would eat one of them.</v>

1222
00:54:36.930 --> 00:54:39.600
<v Speaker 3>Oh no way that they need.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would eat one?</v>

1223
00:54:39.690 --> 00:54:42.900
<v Speaker 3>There was speculation that some of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mongols like decimation,</v>

1224
00:54:42.901 --> 00:54:47.340
<v Speaker 3>like decimated and it's like destroying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but would it really is like a desperate,</v>

1225
00:54:47.341 --> 00:54:50.490
<v Speaker 3>like this 10 people you kill one was run</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of supplies,</v>

1226
00:54:50.790 --> 00:54:51.623
<v Speaker 3>but that the Mongols would pick one </v>
<v Speaker 3>amongst them and they would eat them so </v>

1227
00:54:54.991 --> 00:54:56.250
<v Speaker 3>that the rest of the troops would </v>
<v Speaker 3>survive.</v>

1228
00:54:56.250 --> 00:54:59.520
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is so crazy.</v>

1229
00:54:59.580 --> 00:55:03.390
<v Speaker 3>And the guy was pretty hightest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you were above a wagon wheel,</v>

1230
00:55:03.391 --> 00:55:05.670
<v Speaker 3>you just cut your fucking head off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's what decimation means.</v>

1231
00:55:05.671 --> 00:55:06.504
<v Speaker 3>The killing of one in every 10 of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>group of people as a punishment for the </v>

1232
00:55:09.721 --> 00:55:13.980
<v Speaker 3>whole group.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that was just the punishment.</v>

1233
00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:18.810
<v Speaker 3>What Dan Carlin was talking about is </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some people and maybe he doesn't</v>

1234
00:55:18.811 --> 00:55:22.110
<v Speaker 3>agree with them or maybe he does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but some people believe it's possible.</v>

1235
00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:24.750
<v Speaker 3>The Mongols did this practice in order </v>
<v Speaker 3>to stay alive.</v>

1236
00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:25.601
<v Speaker 3>They definitely did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

1237
00:55:25.601 --> 00:55:28.680
<v Speaker 3>they used to suck the blood out of their</v>
<v Speaker 3>horses and they would add milk to it.</v>

1238
00:55:28.770 --> 00:55:29.603
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just,</v>

1239
00:55:29.940 --> 00:55:31.050
<v Speaker 3>they're hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

1240
00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:32.370
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to suck some blood on his</v>

1241
00:55:32.371 --> 00:55:33.001
<v Speaker 3>horse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1242
00:55:33.001 --> 00:55:36.060
<v Speaker 3>that's how they stayed alive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would cut the blood,</v>

1243
00:55:36.061 --> 00:55:36.894
<v Speaker 3>like cut an artery fill like a jug with </v>
<v Speaker 3>blood and then they would milk them and </v>

1244
00:55:40.021 --> 00:55:42.090
<v Speaker 3>mix the blood and the milk together and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they would eat that.</v>

1245
00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:43.033
<v Speaker 3>And then their kids started getting soft</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they became quote unquote </v>

1246
00:55:44.941 --> 00:55:48.090
<v Speaker 3>Chinese.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like they like a Coupla guys.</v>

1247
00:55:48.091 --> 00:55:50.640
<v Speaker 3>They used to have to send them back to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the step to keep their edge.</v>

1248
00:55:50.730 --> 00:55:52.410
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1249
00:55:52.411 --> 00:55:53.460
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I feel like,</v>

1250
00:55:53.461 --> 00:55:54.294
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like when I call someone like ally </v>

1251
00:55:55.631 --> 00:55:56.464
<v Speaker 3>of people and some New York people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I call them a indoor cats warehouse </v>

1252

<v Speaker 3>cats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1253
00:56:00.510 --> 00:56:01.343
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like the difference between a </v>

1254
00:56:03.900 --> 00:56:04.733
<v Speaker 3>pigeon and like a bird of paradise with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the big plumes because they don't have </v>

1255
00:56:06.931 --> 00:56:09.930
<v Speaker 3>any fucking predators.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Moshe Kasher is a house cat big time.</v>

1256

<v Speaker 3>I love him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1297
00:57:54.790 --> 00:57:56.500
<v Speaker 3>He just wanted to look tough and cool to</v>
<v Speaker 3>her.</v>

1298
00:57:56.720 --> 00:57:57.790
<v Speaker 3>It was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

<v Speaker 3>and like it was the worst bouncer in </v>

1300
00:58:00.401 --> 00:58:02.110
<v Speaker 3>history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you're supposed to deescalate.</v>

1301
00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:03.380
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1302
00:58:03.381 --> 00:58:04.550
<v Speaker 3>you spill a drink.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a,</v>

1303
00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:09.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to beat the fuck out of 30 </v>
<v Speaker 3>people a bear must eat 90 pounds of food</v>

1304
00:58:09.071 --> 00:58:10.880
<v Speaker 3>each day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1305
00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:12.233
<v Speaker 3>If you were telling them to fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they may intake one Ali Wong per day </v>

1306
00:58:18.100 --> 00:58:20.410
<v Speaker 3>during the winter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When food is scarce,</v>

1307
00:58:21.010 --> 00:58:21.831
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1308
00:58:21.831 --> 00:58:22.091
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1309
00:58:22.091 --> 00:58:22.924
<v Speaker 3>Grizzly bears are specialized to adapt </v>
<v Speaker 3>during warmer months to eat a massive </v>

1310
00:58:25.721 --> 00:58:26.554
<v Speaker 3>amounts of food so they can live off </v>
<v Speaker 3>during the body fat during the winter </v>

1311
00:58:29.710 --> 00:58:30.760
<v Speaker 3>when food is scarce.</v>

1312
00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:32.740
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't eat during the winter.</v>

1313
00:58:32.741 --> 00:58:34.840
<v Speaker 3>Most of the time they just hibernate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they get like super,</v>

1314
00:58:34.841 --> 00:58:37.780
<v Speaker 3>super fat intake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Forty kilograms,</v>

1315
00:58:37.781 --> 00:58:40.210
<v Speaker 3>90 pounds of food a day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's Alli Ninety.</v>

1316
00:58:40.330 --> 00:58:43.840
<v Speaker 3>Well you were talking about on a podcast</v>
<v Speaker 3>about a when they blueberries.</v>

1317
00:58:43.841 --> 00:58:46.750
<v Speaker 3>It's an interesting flavor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never experienced it,</v>

1318
00:58:46.751 --> 00:58:48.670
<v Speaker 3>but apparently that's what everybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>says.</v>

1319
00:58:48.671 --> 00:58:49.504
<v Speaker 3>And Steven Rinella had a show about it </v>
<v Speaker 3>where he shot a bear on a blueberry </v>

1320
00:58:52.391 --> 00:58:54.770
<v Speaker 3>patch and then when he's opening the bar</v>
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

1321
00:58:54.771 --> 00:58:56.950
<v Speaker 3>But you see purple,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a purple.</v>

<v Speaker 3>then he might be in trouble and the bear</v>

1362
01:00:27.231 --> 01:00:31.220
<v Speaker 3>killed him bear.</v>

<v Speaker 3>the bear was trying to shoo them away </v>
<v Speaker 3>from his cash because he had buried the </v>

1364
01:00:37.821 --> 01:00:41.210

01:01:07.190 --> 01:01:08.023
<v Speaker 3>bear and understand that these are these</v>
<v Speaker 3>things or consequence of the natural </v>

1375
01:01:11.511 --> 01:01:15.560
<v Speaker 3>world that we engage with and you cannot</v>
<v Speaker 3>put them above people.</v>

1376
01:01:15.620 --> 01:01:18.170
<v Speaker 3>It's just you are a trader to your </v>
<v Speaker 3>species.</v>

1377
01:01:18.910 --> 01:01:19.743
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course you're missing the whole </v>

1378
01:01:21.441 --> 01:01:22.274
<v Speaker 3>lesson that was learned by civilization </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we miss it to the people that the </v>

1379
01:01:25.791 --> 01:01:28.850
<v Speaker 3>only thing that civilization is the key </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that fuck the animals,</v>

1380
01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:29.893
<v Speaker 3>they miss it too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the people that don't understand </v>

1381
01:01:31.911 --> 01:01:33.640
<v Speaker 3>what the animals actually are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1382
01:01:33.650 --> 01:01:37.580
<v Speaker 3>you're missing a giant wolves will eat </v>
<v Speaker 3>your family.</v>

1383
01:01:37.610 --> 01:01:38.690
<v Speaker 3>There are a lot of herbivores.</v>

1384
01:01:38.690 --> 01:01:39.523
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like what you were talking about </v>

1385
01:01:40.461 --> 01:01:40.850
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1386
01:01:40.850 --> 01:01:44.060
<v Speaker 3>with the people that used to have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>break a rabbit's snack to,</v>

1387
01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:45.171
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like my,</v>

1388
01:01:45.171 --> 01:01:46.004
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my mom,</v>

1389
01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:49.100
<v Speaker 3>my uncle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my mom's brother there were so poor that</v>

1390
01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:49.993
<v Speaker 3>he used to hunt for their food and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>he became wealthy and now he goes to </v>

1391
01:01:53.090 --> 01:01:54.430
<v Speaker 3>Africa to hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1392
01:01:54.890 --> 01:01:58.580
<v Speaker 3>the Cape Buffaloes and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

1393
01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:01.460
<v Speaker 3>the Cape Buffalo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are really dangerous.</v>

1394
01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:03.260
<v Speaker 3>And they call them the black death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1395
01:02:03.261 --> 01:02:05.540
<v Speaker 3>Though I guess they're more dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 3>than like lions and shit.</v>

1396
01:02:05.590 --> 01:02:08.480
<v Speaker 3>They can rip you apart thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 3>pounds.</v>

1397
01:02:08.810 --> 01:02:11.900
<v Speaker 3>They're enormous animals and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1398
01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:14.750
<v Speaker 3>like even lions have a hard time taking </v>
<v Speaker 3>those fucking things out.</v>

1399
01:02:14.990 --> 01:02:15.823
<v Speaker 3>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a documentary called relentless </v>

1400
01:02:17.301 --> 01:02:20.100
<v Speaker 3>enemies and it's about this one area of</v>

1401
01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:20.933
<v Speaker 1>Africa that something happened in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>river shifted course and when the </v>

1402
01:02:24.871 --> 01:02:27.000
<v Speaker 1>river's shifted course created an </v>
<v Speaker 1>island,</v>

1403
01:02:27.150 --> 01:02:32.150
<v Speaker 1>a very large island,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but on this island was lions and buffalo</v>

1404
01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:37.500
<v Speaker 1>and the lions had to get bigger because </v>
<v Speaker 1>all they could kill was the buffalo.</v>

1405
01:02:37.650 --> 01:02:39.630
<v Speaker 1>So these lines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they.</v>

1406
01:02:39.810 --> 01:02:42.540
<v Speaker 1>It's a really fascinating thing because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they think it only happened,</v>

1407
01:02:43.170 --> 01:02:44.670
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to talk at a school because</v>

1408
01:02:44.671 --> 01:02:47.040
<v Speaker 1>I always do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it was like 200 years ago.</v>

1409
01:02:47.070 --> 01:02:47.903
<v Speaker 1>I think it was like a real recent amount</v>
<v Speaker 1>of time and in that time these lines </v>

1410
01:02:50.671 --> 01:02:52.530
<v Speaker 1>have developed like hulk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like bodies.</v>

1411
01:02:52.770 --> 01:02:56.250
<v Speaker 1>They look freakish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The average female lion is as big as the</v>

1412
01:02:56.251 --> 01:02:59.280
<v Speaker 1>average male lion on mainland Africa </v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

1413
01:02:59.281 --> 01:03:01.320
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy how fast evolution moves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1414
01:03:01.321 --> 01:03:02.154
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this type of math in England </v>

1415
01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:05.640
<v Speaker 1>that was white and it used to hide on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1416
01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:06.713
<v Speaker 1>on the Birch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then when the industrial revolution </v>

1417
01:03:08.460 --> 01:03:09.660
<v Speaker 1>kicked off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1418
01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:10.713
<v Speaker 1>it made everything city in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the fucking mouth was black and like </v>

1419
01:03:13.291 --> 01:03:14.124
<v Speaker 1>30 years because the birds is kept </v>
<v Speaker 1>picking off all the white ones and then </v>

1420
01:03:17.731 --> 01:03:20.910
<v Speaker 1>like the only three that were black or </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting all the pussy.</v>

1421
01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:22.230
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1422
01:03:22.231 --> 01:03:25.500
<v Speaker 1>It's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say a white person becomes black if</v>

1423
01:03:25.501 --> 01:03:28.440
<v Speaker 1>they have to live in African lifestyle </v>
<v Speaker 1>Subsaharan and 20,000</v>

1424
01:03:28.441 --> 01:03:30.990
<v Speaker 1>years like you're totally black.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1425
01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:32.430
<v Speaker 1>Well that's what white is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

1426
01:03:32.431 --> 01:03:35.340
<v Speaker 1>Why does a solar panel for Vitamin d?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>

1427
01:03:35.430 --> 01:03:36.290
<v Speaker 1>That's all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1428
01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:38.700
<v Speaker 1>We're just fucking snow monkeys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody is.</v>

1429
01:03:39.060 --> 01:03:41.250
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We would have been way better off.</v>

1430
01:03:41.251 --> 01:03:42.084
<v Speaker 1>We only looked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all look the same and the only thing </v>

1431
01:03:44.971 --> 01:03:47.230
<v Speaker 1>that separated us were how fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid you were.</v>

1432
01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:49.520
<v Speaker 1>We have been way better off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be an unbelievable.</v>

1433
01:03:49.620 --> 01:03:52.800
<v Speaker 1>We'd be able to categorize people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>like affective ways,</v>

1434
01:03:53.750 --> 01:03:54.583
<v Speaker 1>but instead you get these white people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are only into other white people </v>

1435
01:03:56.851 --> 01:03:57.181
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1436
01:03:57.181 --> 01:04:00.270
<v Speaker 1>fuck heads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the least effective categories.</v>

1437
01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:02.280
<v Speaker 1>So bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's such a bad category.</v>

1438
01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:05.290
<v Speaker 1>Like put dummies versus smarties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good category.</v>

1439
01:04:05.330 --> 01:04:06.570
<v Speaker 1>Credit category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same with like,</v>

1440
01:04:06.571 --> 01:04:07.404
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I judge people based on like pleated </v>

1441
01:04:08.491 --> 01:04:09.240
<v Speaker 1>pants.</v>

1442
01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:12.000
<v Speaker 1>Whether you can keep a secret,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep a secret as massive.</v>

1443
01:04:13.570 --> 01:04:17.130
<v Speaker 1>Like keep a secret is huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's huge.</v>

1444
01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:18.113
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's like I'll get on boards </v>
<v Speaker 1>or like I'll get on board with some </v>

1445
01:04:21.811 --> 01:04:24.150
<v Speaker 1>shit's moving around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't want to.</v>

1446
01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:27.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a big reveal guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that shit's for the birds.</v>

1447
01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:28.673
<v Speaker 1>Big reveal guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when people just talk shit about </v>

1448
01:04:30.841 --> 01:04:35.000
<v Speaker 1>people or it's I guess what I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I know I'm not like that distraction</v>

1449
01:04:35.370 --> 01:04:36.700
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

1450
01:04:37.470 --> 01:04:39.480
<v Speaker 1>if you don't have to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't do that.</v>

1451
01:04:39.481 --> 01:04:40.314
<v Speaker 1>But the only reason why you want to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is we want to create some </v>

1452
01:04:42.631 --> 01:04:47.260
<v Speaker 1>excitement outside of what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually doing to progress the.</v>

1453
01:04:47.350 --> 01:04:49.340
<v Speaker 1>The life that you live in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1454
01:04:49.420 --> 01:04:50.253
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless do like calling someone out like </v>

1455
01:04:51.270 --> 01:04:53.160
<v Speaker 1>someone committed a crime or something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

1456
01:04:53.161 --> 01:04:55.260
<v Speaker 1>We're not talking about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like this idea.</v>

1457
01:04:55.290 --> 01:04:57.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying I could keep a secret </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a crime too.</v>

1458
01:04:57.181 --> 01:05:02.181
<v Speaker 1>If you ever come to the instinct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the instinct to engage in that is all.</v>

1459
01:05:02.911 --> 01:05:04.110
<v Speaker 1>It's all negative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1460
01:05:04.111 --> 01:05:04.791
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

1461
01:05:04.791 --> 01:05:05.624
<v Speaker 1>I think it goes back to that whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>reward system thing were I think in a </v>

1462
01:05:09.271 --> 01:05:10.104
<v Speaker 1>lot of ways we're very program to not </v>
<v Speaker 1>just accept but even seek out conflict </v>

1463
01:05:15.570 --> 01:05:16.403
<v Speaker 1>and to be upset about things and to like</v>
<v Speaker 1>look for those things in the news and </v>

1464
01:05:20.380 --> 01:05:21.213
<v Speaker 1>look for those things because we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How often do you see conflict with </v>

1465
01:05:23.471 --> 01:05:24.340
<v Speaker 1>humans?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1466
01:05:24.341 --> 01:05:26.110
<v Speaker 1>like if you see like Manhattan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1467
01:05:26.250 --> 01:05:28.360
<v Speaker 1>And you see all these people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>driving their cars,</v>

1468
01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:30.280
<v Speaker 1>walk in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get on the bus,</v>

1469
01:05:30.340 --> 01:05:31.173
<v Speaker 1>get on the train.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The vast majority show no conflict with </v>

1470
01:05:35.291 --> 01:05:39.280
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The absolute vast majority.</v>

1471
01:05:39.290 --> 01:05:41.680
<v Speaker 1>It's actually amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking magnificent.</v>

1472
01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:45.070
<v Speaker 1>Chimps were so peaceful compared to what</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could be,</v>

1473
01:05:45.190 --> 01:05:49.510
<v Speaker 1>but now compare that to the vast </v>
<v Speaker 1>majority of interactions online.</v>

1474
01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:56.000
<v Speaker 1>No comparison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The online might be 50 percent conflict.</v>

1475
01:05:57.220 --> 01:05:57.731
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1476
01:05:57.731 --> 01:05:59.140
<v Speaker 1>And it's absurd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Conflict.</v>

1477
01:05:59.141 --> 01:05:59.974
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I'm going to fuck your mouth </v>

1478
01:06:00.881 --> 01:06:01.780
<v Speaker 1>with a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1479
01:06:01.781 --> 01:06:03.030
<v Speaker 1>I thought we were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthcare.</v>

1480
01:06:03.250 --> 01:06:04.083
<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't even do that to someone </v>

1481
01:06:05.141 --> 01:06:07.780
<v Speaker 1>explained to you what fuck is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>

1482
01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:11.860
<v Speaker 1>you know the one on the chalkboard if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you fuck my mouth with a gun.</v>

1483
01:06:12.450 --> 01:06:15.820
<v Speaker 1>It's like when you reveal that you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know something based on an intense.</v>

1484
01:06:15.821 --> 01:06:19.060
<v Speaker 1>And so did you see that thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone wrote about Ivanka trump?</v>

1485
01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:19.933
<v Speaker 1>All the different words that she uses </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong and like that she doesn't </v>

1486
01:06:22.421 --> 01:06:23.254
<v Speaker 1>understand English.</v>

1487
01:06:25.980 --> 01:06:26.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look man,</v>

1488
01:06:26.981 --> 01:06:28.180
<v Speaker 1>how old is she?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like 30.</v>

1489
01:06:28.900 --> 01:06:30.190
<v Speaker 1>Oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's not.</v>

1490
01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:33.640
<v Speaker 1>She's not old right now for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>

1491
01:06:33.641 --> 01:06:35.620
<v Speaker 1>Don't 36,</v>
<v Speaker 1>36.</v>

1492
01:06:37.670 --> 01:06:39.400
<v Speaker 1>I'll give her a pass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she is 38.</v>

1493
01:06:39.550 --> 01:06:40.383
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1494
01:06:41.950 --> 01:06:42.783
<v Speaker 1>most people don't know how to use words </v>
<v Speaker 1>correctly and then all of a sudden your </v>

1495
01:06:45.881 --> 01:06:47.200
<v Speaker 1>fucking dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the president.</v>

1496
01:06:47.201 --> 01:06:47.651
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

1497
01:06:47.651 --> 01:06:49.750
<v Speaker 1>I thought you were reality show host,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1498
01:06:49.751 --> 01:06:52.420
<v Speaker 1>I think I thought it easy road here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck?</v>

1499
01:06:52.820 --> 01:06:55.690
<v Speaker 1>I thought I would never reached the </v>
<v Speaker 1>public guy.</v>

1500
01:06:55.890 --> 01:06:59.600
<v Speaker 1>I'd be fucking flying private jets to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Israel every year if you're like now and</v>

1501
01:06:59.620 --> 01:07:01.950
<v Speaker 1>I need to know what magnanimity means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

1502
01:07:02.050 --> 01:07:05.320
<v Speaker 1>What about the yacht on the Caribbean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

1503
01:07:05.380 --> 01:07:07.930
<v Speaker 1>That's what I was preparing my 35 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>

1504
01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:12.490
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden after figuring out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>correct use of words did I got a massive</v>

1505
01:07:12.491 --> 01:07:16.000
<v Speaker 1>verbal skills and horrible spelling.</v>

1506
01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:18.630
<v Speaker 1>I've liked this weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like my,</v>

1507
01:07:18.660 --> 01:07:20.620
<v Speaker 1>my ability to hear words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember words.</v>

1508
01:07:20.621 --> 01:07:23.560
<v Speaker 1>My vocabulary is huge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I spent like a fucking idiot.</v>

1509
01:07:23.890 --> 01:07:25.930
<v Speaker 1>My spelling's atrocious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like horrible.</v>

1510
01:07:26.110 --> 01:07:26.541
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My.</v>

1511
01:07:26.541 --> 01:07:28.240
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I rely on that squiggly line,</v>

1512
01:07:28.630 --> 01:07:31.360
<v Speaker 1>that red squiggly line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so critical for me.</v>

1513
01:07:31.390 --> 01:07:34.810
<v Speaker 1>But what about no suggestions?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't play that game man.</v>

1514
01:07:35.020 --> 01:07:35.930
<v Speaker 1>That's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1515
01:07:35.940 --> 01:07:37.390
<v Speaker 1>like swinging an ax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1516
01:07:37.391 --> 01:07:38.224
<v Speaker 1>steel toed boots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes I don't realize it's in </v>

1517
01:07:42.581 --> 01:07:43.960
<v Speaker 1>Spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1518
01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.070
<v Speaker 1>And like as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1519
01:07:45.071 --> 01:07:49.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm flying my late night rants and fly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My thumbs are flying thumbs.</v>

1520
01:07:49.330 --> 01:07:51.700
<v Speaker 1>So you do everything 100 percent from </v>
<v Speaker 1>your phone.</v>

1521
01:07:52.060 --> 01:07:52.893
<v Speaker 1>Everything from stronger addiction </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're not even pretending you </v>

1522
01:07:55.871 --> 01:07:58.100
<v Speaker 1>might get a productivity done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you,</v>

1523
01:07:59.110 --> 01:08:02.110
<v Speaker 1>if your laptop and you've got Microsoft </v>
<v Speaker 1>Word Open.</v>

1524
01:08:02.130 --> 01:08:02.963
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and occasionally you check twitter like </v>

1525
01:08:04.630 --> 01:08:06.510
<v Speaker 1>bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know shit about Beethoven,</v>

1526
01:08:08.180 --> 01:08:09.013
<v Speaker 1>but I'm trying to wind down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is crazy because it's like the </v>

1527
01:08:11.711 --> 01:08:14.860
<v Speaker 1>worst way to wind down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like cyber conflict.</v>

1528
01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:16.130
<v Speaker 1>That's not a way to wind down.</v>

1529
01:08:16.190 --> 01:08:17.023
<v Speaker 3>That's not the way to wine because my </v>
<v Speaker 3>wife would fall asleep before me and </v>

1530
01:08:19.341 --> 01:08:22.980
<v Speaker 3>then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to watch TV and be loud and</v>

1531
01:08:23.180 --> 01:08:25.010
<v Speaker 3>sometimes I'll go in other rooms and </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

1532
01:08:25.011 --> 01:08:27.290
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I think,</v>

1533
01:08:27.830 --> 01:08:30.070
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is very pretentious to say </v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1534
01:08:30.110 --> 01:08:31.490
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it is true.</v>

1535
01:08:31.690 --> 01:08:32.523
<v Speaker 3>But I think that all of us who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>having a chance to talk about our </v>

1536
01:08:35.181 --> 01:08:38.780
<v Speaker 3>experiences in this life are influencing</v>
<v Speaker 3>each other.</v>

1537
01:08:38.990 --> 01:08:41.240
<v Speaker 3>That includes you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That includes everybody.</v>

1538
01:08:41.241 --> 01:08:45.710
<v Speaker 3>I know the clues red should fear and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Thompson and Duncan were all influencing</v>

1539
01:08:45.770 --> 01:08:50.770
<v Speaker 3>each other and we were all in some way </v>
<v Speaker 3>helping each other like mitigate all the</v>

1540
01:08:53.121 --> 01:08:56.990
<v Speaker 3>weird influences that we experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's a big one.</v>

1541
01:08:57.320 --> 01:08:58.153
<v Speaker 3>The Big One is our addiction to </v>
<v Speaker 3>information and that the addiction to </v>

1542
01:09:02.121 --> 01:09:06.050
<v Speaker 3>information can overwhelm your ability </v>
<v Speaker 3>to process the information.</v>

1543
01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:07.153
<v Speaker 3>Like if you're just reading shit about </v>
<v Speaker 3>like world news and a breaking news and </v>

1544
01:09:13.821 --> 01:09:17.990
<v Speaker 3>all the craziness you're doing that all </v>
<v Speaker 3>day while you're awake.</v>

1545
01:09:18.140 --> 01:09:19.850
<v Speaker 3>Like I say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you gave your phone,</v>

1546
01:09:20.270 --> 01:09:21.103
<v Speaker 3>like if somebody had a phone and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>had won the mophie packs so they can </v>

1547
01:09:23.991 --> 01:09:26.510
<v Speaker 3>keep that bitch run and check the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Internet all day.</v>

1548
01:09:26.870 --> 01:09:28.580
<v Speaker 3>At the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what have you.</v>

1549
01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:29.473
<v Speaker 3>Have you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you even taken the time to </v>

1550
01:09:31.671 --> 01:09:32.504
<v Speaker 3>momentarily reflect about what any of </v>
<v Speaker 3>this means or are you just taking a </v>

1551
01:09:37.010 --> 01:09:40.610
<v Speaker 3>fucking guy with a truck killed bikers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1552
01:09:40.780 --> 01:09:43.010
<v Speaker 3>oh wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck that guy's guy.</v>

1553
01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:44.053
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dustin Hoffman's a piece of shit to </v>

1554
01:09:45.530 --> 01:09:46.363
<v Speaker 3>retweet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much time are you spending where </v>

1555
01:09:49.911 --> 01:09:54.911
<v Speaker 3>you're thinking about life yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world around you?</v>

1556
01:09:56.780 --> 01:10:00.170
<v Speaker 3>What are the motivations for all this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this kid that ran over these people</v>

1557
01:10:00.171 --> 01:10:01.700
<v Speaker 3>in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's his motivation?</v>

1558
01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:02.713
<v Speaker 3>Who is he?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who did the most awful job ever of </v>

1559
01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:07.500
<v Speaker 3>parenting this fucking monster?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1560
01:10:07.540 --> 01:10:08.373
<v Speaker 3>We think that Allah wants him to stomp </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the gas and run over a bunch of dark </v>

1561
01:10:13.310 --> 01:10:13.470
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>

1562
01:10:13.470 --> 01:10:14.303
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just on that bike path of my son </v>

1563
01:10:16.641 --> 01:10:17.474
<v Speaker 3>and I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to stay objective sometimes </v>

1564
01:10:19.191 --> 01:10:20.240
<v Speaker 3>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eh.</v>

1565
01:10:20.241 --> 01:10:22.220
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck you.</v>

1566
01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:25.910
<v Speaker 3>It's like emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mac Is Peterson talks about how uh,</v>

1567
01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:26.793
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the need for information is the same </v>

1568
01:10:28.401 --> 01:10:29.234
<v Speaker 3>part of the brain for a foraging food </v>
<v Speaker 3>and now that we have all this food </v>

1569
01:10:32.841 --> 01:10:36.050
<v Speaker 3>reforging other shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think it's like all think that's a</v>

1570
01:10:36.051 --> 01:10:39.650
<v Speaker 3>really good point and stressed enough </v>
<v Speaker 3>now that we have all this food,</v>

1571
01:10:39.651 --> 01:10:42.110
<v Speaker 3>we're foraging other shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1572
01:10:42.140 --> 01:10:42.973
<v Speaker 3>We're forging outrage or forging the </v>
<v Speaker 3>need for reform or forging this violent </v>

1573
01:10:48.351 --> 01:10:49.184
<v Speaker 3>interaction between cultures were </v>
<v Speaker 3>forging all this fucking craziness </v>

1574
01:10:53.721 --> 01:10:54.554
<v Speaker 3>online.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like every day you're seeing more and </v>

1575
01:10:56.661 --> 01:10:57.494
<v Speaker 3>more craziness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People telling people they can't wear </v>

1576
01:10:59.481 --> 01:11:02.210
<v Speaker 3>braids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People tell people,</v>

1577
01:11:02.230 --> 01:11:03.063
<v Speaker 3>tells you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Appropriation is the most insane </v>

1578
01:11:04.250 --> 01:11:05.083
<v Speaker 3>psychotic thing and it's getting worse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But my twitter timeline think Jamie </v>

1579
01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:13.440
<v Speaker 3>Kilstein did us all a giant favor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not being disingenuous.</v>

1580
01:11:13.441 --> 01:11:14.250
<v Speaker 3>I think he did</v>

1581
01:11:14.250 --> 01:11:16.020
<v Speaker 6>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I don't hate that guy.</v>

1582
01:11:16.260 --> 01:11:16.890
<v Speaker 6>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've had,</v>

1583
01:11:16.890 --> 01:11:20.340
<v Speaker 6>I've had bad moments by life,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I've made dumb decisions.</v>

1584
01:11:20.910 --> 01:11:21.743
<v Speaker 6>Owning up to those dumb decisions makes </v>
<v Speaker 6>you a real character like someone of of </v>

1585
01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:27.433
<v Speaker 6>real character to me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I want to say I was going to say a real </v>

1586
01:11:29.071 --> 01:11:31.200
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it applies to women as well.</v>

1587
01:11:31.201 --> 01:11:32.034
<v Speaker 6>Like owning up to those fuck ups is so </v>
<v Speaker 6>goddamn huge and Jamie did it and I </v>

1588
01:11:36.661 --> 01:11:40.380
<v Speaker 6>think we need to understand like when </v>
<v Speaker 6>someone does do something like that,</v>

1589
01:11:40.650 --> 01:11:43.800
<v Speaker 6>you gotta,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you gotta stand up and fucking golf clap</v>

1590
01:11:43.860 --> 01:11:45.150
<v Speaker 6>you gotTa,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you gotTa,</v>

1591
01:11:45.151 --> 01:11:45.984
<v Speaker 6>you gotTa,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you gotTa let people know that and </v>

1592
01:11:47.710 --> 01:11:48.543
<v Speaker 6>there's a lot of other people that also </v>
<v Speaker 6>could have these revelations in these </v>

1593
01:11:51.181 --> 01:11:53.210
<v Speaker 6>moments that stand up and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

1594
01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:55.530
<v Speaker 6>and be real with you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then I,</v>

1595
01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:56.473
<v Speaker 6>all of us would recognize those moments </v>
<v Speaker 6>and those feelings in our own self and </v>

1596
01:11:59.821 --> 01:12:01.170
<v Speaker 6>we can move on better.</v>

1597
01:12:01.330 --> 01:12:05.070
<v Speaker 6>We can move on better than we're doing </v>
<v Speaker 6>with Jamie did by coming on this podcast</v>

1598
01:12:05.071 --> 01:12:05.904
<v Speaker 6>and talking about his life as a social </v>
<v Speaker 6>justice warrior and all the nuttiness </v>

1599
01:12:09.361 --> 01:12:11.940
<v Speaker 6>that he was involved in and all the </v>
<v Speaker 6>rules and regulations,</v>

1600
01:12:11.970 --> 01:12:12.803
<v Speaker 6>what you could and couldn't say and how </v>
<v Speaker 6>he knew it and even though he thought </v>

1601
01:12:15.631 --> 01:12:16.464
<v Speaker 6>things were wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he couldn't express himself because it </v>

1602
01:12:17.541 --> 01:12:22.541
<v Speaker 6>would be outside of the progressive </v>
<v Speaker 6>doctrine that they had to all follow by.</v>

1603
01:12:23.300 --> 01:12:24.133
<v Speaker 6>That's giant man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's trying for all of us because just </v>

1604
01:12:26.071 --> 01:12:26.904
<v Speaker 6>like Jordan Peterson has expressed that </v>
<v Speaker 6>we could all be Nazis if we were that </v>

1605
01:12:29.701 --> 01:12:32.100
<v Speaker 6>person insurance circumstance with </v>
<v Speaker 6>those,</v>

1606
01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:34.350
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>those stresses and pressures.</v>

1607
01:12:34.890 --> 01:12:39.750
<v Speaker 6>That's what terrifies us about all this </v>
<v Speaker 6>stuff that you could be that person that</v>

1608
01:12:39.870 --> 01:12:40.703
<v Speaker 6>if you were born in Uzbekistan or </v>
<v Speaker 6>wherever the fuck this terrorist was </v>

1609
01:12:45.091 --> 01:12:47.430
<v Speaker 6>born,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that ran over these people that have all</v>

1610
01:12:47.431 --> 01:12:48.990
<v Speaker 6>the terrible things that happened to </v>
<v Speaker 6>him,</v>

1611
01:12:48.991 --> 01:12:49.920
<v Speaker 6>happened to you.</v>

<v Speaker 6>You could be.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That guy was hitting that gas.</v>

1613
01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:55.770
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's no difference between you and me</v>

1614
01:12:55.771 --> 01:12:56.604
<v Speaker 6>and Jamie and everybody listening.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're all just people and we're a </v>

1615
01:12:59.401 --> 01:13:00.234
<v Speaker 6>combination of biology where a </v>
<v Speaker 6>combination of life experiences and our </v>

1616
01:13:04.021 --> 01:13:04.854
<v Speaker 6>community and our circumstances and what</v>
<v Speaker 6>we've learned that we have to recognize </v>

1617
01:13:09.541 --> 01:13:10.374
<v Speaker 6>that instead of like trying to appear to</v>
<v Speaker 6>have moral superiority over everybody </v>

1618
01:13:14.431 --> 01:13:15.264
<v Speaker 6>above you because you haven't committed </v>
<v Speaker 6>murder yet or you haven't run a red </v>

1619
01:13:19.051 --> 01:13:19.884
<v Speaker 6>light,</v>
<v Speaker 6>were wound up killing someone because </v>

1620
01:13:20.781 --> 01:13:21.614
<v Speaker 6>you had an impulsive desire to get to </v>
<v Speaker 6>work on time or you haven't got drove </v>

1621
01:13:25.411 --> 01:13:26.244
<v Speaker 6>home drunk because you've made a mistake</v>
<v Speaker 6>and your girlfriend left the party and </v>

1622
01:13:29.971 --> 01:13:30.804
<v Speaker 6>you were fucking pissed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You got in your car and you plowed into </v>

1623
01:13:32.851 --> 01:13:35.940
<v Speaker 6>a car.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All those things we want to.</v>

1624
01:13:36.090 --> 01:13:39.990
<v Speaker 6>We want to demonize people because we're</v>
<v Speaker 6>scared to death.</v>

1625
01:13:40.140 --> 01:13:40.973
<v Speaker 6>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Seeing those ideas in ourselves or </v>

1626
01:13:42.181 --> 01:13:43.740
<v Speaker 6>seeing those actions and ourselves.</v>

1627
01:13:43.770 --> 01:13:44.603
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and that and that soldier that's in </v>

1628
01:13:45.391 --> 01:13:46.224
<v Speaker 6>line.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The line between good and evil is right </v>

1629
01:13:48.271 --> 01:13:50.070
<v Speaker 6>down the middle of a person's heart.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1630
01:13:50.460 --> 01:13:51.293
<v Speaker 6>that we have that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>None of us are just good or bad and we </v>

1631
01:13:53.671 --> 01:13:54.580
<v Speaker 6>can't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1632
01:13:54.810 --> 01:13:58.320
<v Speaker 6>just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just proclaim someone as bad and as good</v>

1633
01:13:58.321 --> 01:14:00.240
<v Speaker 6>unfairly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Those are the people I root against.</v>

1634
01:14:00.241 --> 01:14:01.074
<v Speaker 6>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's not the flawed humans that make </v>

1635
01:14:02.491 --> 01:14:03.324
<v Speaker 6>mistakes and just our human,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's the people that demonize everyone </v>

1636
01:14:06.991 --> 01:14:08.880
<v Speaker 6>but damn,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and you see that they're almost just,</v>

1637
01:14:08.881 --> 01:14:11.010
<v Speaker 6>it's projecting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like the biggest homophobes the gay</v>

1638
01:14:11.020 --> 01:14:11.853
<v Speaker 6>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1639
01:14:12.020 --> 01:14:13.150
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

1640
01:14:13.270 --> 01:14:17.800
<v Speaker 1>and that's what gets me angry and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like when you're trying to get social,</v>

1641
01:14:17.801 --> 01:14:18.634
<v Speaker 1>like what happened to me with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a defined that kid situation where </v>

1642
01:14:21.011 --> 01:14:21.490
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1643
01:14:21.490 --> 01:14:23.860
<v Speaker 1>explain that because most people don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know what you're talking about.</v>

1644
01:14:24.190 --> 01:14:25.750
<v Speaker 1>Most people don't know the </v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances.</v>

1645
01:14:25.751 --> 01:14:26.351
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1646
01:14:26.351 --> 01:14:27.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is this,</v>

1647
01:14:27.100 --> 01:14:32.100
<v Speaker 1>this guy who has a three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had a three year old boy did,</v>

1648
01:14:32.500 --> 01:14:36.900
<v Speaker 1>he claimed was transgendered and </v>
<v Speaker 1>identified as a girl and started,</v>

1649
01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>putting dresses on the kid and uh,</v>

1650
01:14:39.730 --> 01:14:40.563
<v Speaker 1>treating them like a girl and I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>planning on giving them hormone therapy </v>

1651
01:14:43.181 --> 01:14:46.570
<v Speaker 1>so they don't go through puberty and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this dude has like power in Hollywood,</v>

1652
01:14:46.571 --> 01:14:47.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

1653
01:14:48.070 --> 01:14:51.240
<v Speaker 1>and I just called them out and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got swarmed and uh,</v>

1654
01:14:51.250 --> 01:14:54.040
<v Speaker 1>I just didn't stop because I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll die on this hill.</v>

1655
01:14:54.370 --> 01:14:55.720
<v Speaker 1>It's a hill to die on.</v>

1656
01:14:55.930 --> 01:14:56.763
<v Speaker 1>When you were deciding that a three year</v>
<v Speaker 1>old has done developing and </v>

1657
01:14:58.991 --> 01:14:59.824
<v Speaker 1>understanding what drives me crazy when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you were talking to is akin to like a </v>

1658
01:15:03.071 --> 01:15:06.820
<v Speaker 1>seance will you find out that you were a</v>
<v Speaker 1>roman emperor from 1700,</v>

1659
01:15:07.030 --> 01:15:11.020
<v Speaker 1>that fucking three year old barely </v>
<v Speaker 1>understands how to express himself.</v>

1660
01:15:11.330 --> 01:15:11.841
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1661
01:15:11.841 --> 01:15:16.841
<v Speaker 1>the idea that a three year old can give </v>
<v Speaker 1>you a complex definition of their sexual</v>

1662
01:15:18.551 --> 01:15:19.384
<v Speaker 1>and gender identity had three and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>this isn't something that you should go </v>

1663
01:15:23.411 --> 01:15:26.940
<v Speaker 1>in and chemically influence that kids </v>
<v Speaker 1>sterile,</v>

1664
01:15:26.950 --> 01:15:28.300
<v Speaker 1>make them a unit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1665
01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:30.240

<v Speaker 1>and it's fucking insane.</v>

1666
01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:33.910
<v Speaker 1>It's a projection of the father's ego.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not even like is it?</v>

1667
01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:35.710

1668
01:15:35.740 --> 01:15:36.573

<v Speaker 1>some fucking reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even as a child,</v>

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1672

<v Speaker 1>You know it because that's you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you mean that's what every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every child is you,</v>

<v Speaker 1>all of us.</v>

1694
01:16:36.580 --> 01:16:37.413
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially when you're a little tiny </v>

1695
01:16:38.711 --> 01:16:39.370
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1696
01:16:39.370 --> 01:16:40.203
<v Speaker 1>you have this insane responsibility as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>big person when you're dealing with a </v>

1697
01:16:44.291 --> 01:16:46.750
<v Speaker 1>little tiny person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now that I have a tiny person,</v>

1698
01:16:46.780 --> 01:16:48.740
<v Speaker 1>that's what it made me more of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

1699
01:16:48.790 --> 01:16:50.610
<v Speaker 1>a man in an adult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>

1700
01:16:50.611 --> 01:16:55.060
<v Speaker 1>I just felt so much more responsibility </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be good 100 percent on the job too.</v>

1701
01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:58.420
<v Speaker 1>He learned on the job like you realize </v>
<v Speaker 1>along the way like,</v>

1702
01:16:58.480 --> 01:16:59.313
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like literally dealing with a blank </v>

1703
01:17:01.361 --> 01:17:05.830
<v Speaker 1>slate and I can't even process this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that my fucking bizarre,</v>

1704
01:17:05.831 --> 01:17:09.860
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous life of telling jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in your case,</v>

1705
01:17:09.861 --> 01:17:10.694
<v Speaker 1>playing songs with pianos and ridiculous</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit that you say on twitter this </v>

1706
01:17:15.170 --> 01:17:20.170
<v Speaker 1>somehow or another qualifies you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>raise a human being so intense.</v>

1707
01:17:20.431 --> 01:17:22.100
<v Speaker 1>It's so it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also it's like I,</v>

1708
01:17:22.101 --> 01:17:22.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1709
01:17:22.920 --> 01:17:23.753
<v Speaker 1>I've always thought I was a good guy but</v>
<v Speaker 1>not like I ever thought I was like </v>

1710
01:17:27.700 --> 01:17:29.570
<v Speaker 1>deserving of anything special,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1711
01:17:29.570 --> 01:17:31.520
<v Speaker 1>But then once you see a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

1712
01:17:32.060 --> 01:17:34.820
<v Speaker 1>he didn't.</v>

<v Speaker 1>good guy.</v>

1725
01:18:02.780 --> 01:18:03.613

<v Speaker 1>as like,</v>

1730
01:18:13.061 --> 01:18:13.894
<v Speaker 1>don't do it.</v>

1731
01:18:14.300 --> 01:18:15.133
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever think about the fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is a conflict that I've </v>

1732
01:18:18.470 --> 01:18:19.303
<v Speaker 1>discussed ad nauseum with some of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends at every one of my friends that </v>

1733
01:18:22.431 --> 01:18:23.264
<v Speaker 1>I know came from fucked up place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the people that I'm friends with </v>

1734
01:18:26.750 --> 01:18:31.750
<v Speaker 1>Cowan or Joey Diaz or anybody read band </v>
<v Speaker 1>or dunk into their childhood was fucking</v>

1735
01:18:33.111 --> 01:18:33.944
<v Speaker 1>chaos already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should fear like everybody's childhood </v>

1736
01:18:36.870 --> 01:18:37.880
<v Speaker 1>was a mess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1737
01:18:37.890 --> 01:18:40.250
<v Speaker 1>I think it's A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's to make a good comic.</v>

1738
01:18:40.251 --> 01:18:41.600
<v Speaker 1>That's still a good dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a,</v>

1739
01:18:41.870 --> 01:18:42.703
<v Speaker 1>it's a combo of like love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like your grandfather and chaos or else </v>

1740
01:18:47.810 --> 01:18:49.940
<v Speaker 1>we're just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Killers were.</v>

1741
01:18:50.020 --> 01:18:51.350
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1742
01:18:51.530 --> 01:18:55.250
<v Speaker 1>I think that goddamn comedy and murder </v>
<v Speaker 1>are so closely related.</v>

1743
01:18:55.251 --> 01:18:57.240
<v Speaker 1>I know and we're just on the good side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Killing.</v>

01:18:57.250 --> 01:18:58.083
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1745
01:18:58.550 --> 01:18:59.383
<v Speaker 1>that is literally Wiley call it because </v>
<v Speaker 1>my mom listened to our last podcast and </v>

01:19:02.211 --> 01:19:03.980
<v Speaker 1>she was like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>But we're,</v>

1756
01:19:25.911 --> 01:19:26.744
<v Speaker 1>we're realizing we're nice people in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>middle of all of like a life with a </v>

1757
01:19:30.321 --> 01:19:32.910
<v Speaker 1>tremendous amount of momentum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of chaos behind chaos.</v>

1763
01:19:37.881 --> 01:19:38.451
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1764
01:19:38.451 --> 01:19:39.284
<v Speaker 1>I might as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had a viking ship for the last 10 </v>

1765
01:19:40.581 --> 01:19:43.550
<v Speaker 1>years where he'd just viking it up and </v>

1766
01:19:43.551 --> 01:19:46.130
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you see that the order you need</v>

1767
01:19:46.131 --> 01:19:47.240
<v Speaker 1>the cast in order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1768
01:19:47.241 --> 01:19:48.074
<v Speaker 1>and you see the order with the child and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you see these people trying to </v>

1769
01:19:50.901 --> 01:19:53.270
<v Speaker 1>exploit children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was just awake,</v>

<v Speaker 1>not good friends,</v>

1774
01:20:00.591 --> 01:20:02.960
<v Speaker 1>not like comics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like middle management.</v>

1775
01:20:02.961 --> 01:20:04.940
<v Speaker 1>That's where the evil is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you know what it is man.</v>

1776
01:20:04.941 --> 01:20:07.130
<v Speaker 1>It's like the supporting</v>

1777
01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:09.053
<v Speaker 6>rights eclipses all the logic involved </v>
<v Speaker 6>in the subtle nuances of human behavior </v>

1778
01:20:14.221 --> 01:20:18.750
<v Speaker 6>and sexuality and the idea that a three </v>
<v Speaker 6>year old could have any,</v>

1779
01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:19.873
<v Speaker 6>any notion of like what it's going to be</v>
<v Speaker 6>like to be eight or what it's going to </v>

1780
01:20:23.281 --> 01:20:24.114
<v Speaker 6>be like to be 16 or whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 6>hormonal changes is going to affect the </v>

1781
01:20:28.201 --> 01:20:29.470
<v Speaker 6>way he expresses himself.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So.</v>

1782
01:20:29.490 --> 01:20:32.940
<v Speaker 6>And also you're looking at this kid and </v>
<v Speaker 6>you're deciding that this kid,</v>

1783
01:20:32.970 --> 01:20:33.803
<v Speaker 6>because there three is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 6>transgender and you want to turn them </v>

1784
01:20:36.211 --> 01:20:37.044
<v Speaker 6>into a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What if this kid decides he's a gay man </v>

1785
01:20:38.911 --> 01:20:41.000
<v Speaker 6>in five years to kill themselves?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right,</v>

1786
01:20:41.130 --> 01:20:41.641
<v Speaker 6>what it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1787
01:20:41.641 --> 01:20:45.390
<v Speaker 6>what if they decide that they're </v>
<v Speaker 6>bisexual in 20 years,</v>

1788
01:20:45.590 --> 01:20:46.423
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can't.</v>

1789
01:20:46.590 --> 01:20:48.900
<v Speaker 6>If you kill,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you care about that child,</v>

1790
01:20:49.260 --> 01:20:50.093
<v Speaker 6>you don't interfere with that process </v>
<v Speaker 6>because I'm not the same thing that I </v>

1791
01:20:52.921 --> 01:20:54.720
<v Speaker 6>was when I was three and you're not </v>
<v Speaker 6>either.</v>

1792
01:20:54.890 --> 01:20:55.723
<v Speaker 6>It is so to inject hormones and </v>
<v Speaker 6>chemicals and even surgery that we </v>

1793
01:21:00.061 --> 01:21:00.894
<v Speaker 6>really have a very limited understanding</v>
<v Speaker 6>about how much this interaction between </v>

1794
01:21:03.991 --> 01:21:08.560
<v Speaker 6>the scalpel and a baby body.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How much of an impact that has you.</v>

1795
01:21:08.620 --> 01:21:09.453
<v Speaker 6>You're giving someone the green light is</v>
<v Speaker 6>that they're talking about making this </v>

1796
01:21:12.271 --> 01:21:13.500
<v Speaker 6>kid a unit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1797
01:21:13.501 --> 01:21:14.334
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they won't go through puberty and so </v>

1798
01:21:15.331 --> 01:21:17.070
<v Speaker 6>then it's like they saying,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what are they saying?</v>

1799
01:21:17.071 --> 01:21:20.340
<v Speaker 6>They were called the hormone blockers </v>
<v Speaker 6>and I kept asking him directly.</v>

1800
01:21:20.341 --> 01:21:21.630
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>say yes or no.</v>

1801
01:21:21.631 --> 01:21:23.670
<v Speaker 6>Are you going to give them hormone </v>
<v Speaker 6>blockers because it's fine.</v>

1802
01:21:23.671 --> 01:21:26.880
<v Speaker 6>If he wants to wear a dress,</v>
<v Speaker 6>have some fun playtime fine,</v>

1803
01:21:27.150 --> 01:21:28.860
<v Speaker 6>but you're going to tell him he's a </v>
<v Speaker 6>girl,</v>

1804
01:21:28.950 --> 01:21:30.440
<v Speaker 6>but here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not even playtime.</v>

1805
01:21:30.450 --> 01:21:31.283
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what if the kid like feels better when </v>

01:21:34.900 --> 01:21:38.640
<v Speaker 6>Like we're all.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We've all decided that pants and a shirt</v>

1808
01:21:38.850 --> 01:21:40.830
<v Speaker 6>is the way to go and if you don't wear </v>
<v Speaker 6>pants and a shirt,</v>

1809
01:21:40.831 --> 01:21:41.420
<v Speaker 6>I know you're home.</v>

1810
01:21:41.420 --> 01:21:46.420

1826
01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:31.640
<v Speaker 6>The right way to approach a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>three year old like you are the problem.</v>

1827
01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:33.713
<v Speaker 6>There's not this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're not talking about one plus one </v>

1828
01:22:35.221 --> 01:22:38.010
<v Speaker 6>equals two.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're talking about a super complex,</v>

1829
01:22:38.130 --> 01:22:43.080
<v Speaker 6>very nuanced issue and if there's child </v>
<v Speaker 6>decides when it's x amount years old,</v>

1830
01:22:43.081 --> 01:22:43.914
<v Speaker 6>whatever we decide 30,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever the fuck we decide to take the </v>

1831
01:22:46.231 --> 01:22:49.440
<v Speaker 6>decision to do to get gender </v>
<v Speaker 6>reassignment,</v>

1832
01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:51.680
<v Speaker 6>that's a 100 percent cool with me </v>
<v Speaker 6>chorus.</v>

1833
01:22:51.810 --> 01:22:52.643
<v Speaker 6>No problem with that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but that's a person who understands who </v>

1834
01:22:55.291 --> 01:23:00.291
<v Speaker 6>they are as a fully developed organism,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not off fucking babies.</v>

1835
01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:01.433
<v Speaker 6>Three.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's a baby dude and part of me it's </v>

1836
01:23:03.991 --> 01:23:05.950
<v Speaker 6>like this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I see myself in the,</v>

1837
01:23:05.990 --> 01:23:06.823
<v Speaker 5>in the kid where I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I played classical piano and knitted </v>

1838
01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:13.060
<v Speaker 5>like I used to like knit cloth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I used to weave,</v>

1839
01:23:13.090 --> 01:23:13.923
<v Speaker 5>I went down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I used to the thing we your piano </v>

<v Speaker 5>my parents are married that have a great</v>

1843
01:23:21.101 --> 01:23:21.934
<v Speaker 5>marriage,</v>

1844
01:23:22.631 --> 01:23:23.464
<v Speaker 5>gender marriage in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Or my dad's like a flamboyant opera </v>

1848
01:23:31.451 --> 01:23:34.660
<v Speaker 5>in the closet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I used to be like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>my dad would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's go see rent again,</v>

<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

1852

<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1853
01:23:42.641 --> 01:23:44.290
<v Speaker 5>uh.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What about your piano teacher?</v>

1854
01:23:44.330 --> 01:23:45.163
<v Speaker 5>When I was 11,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my piano teacher became a dude and the </v>

1855
01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:51.390
<v Speaker 5>bit I tried to work on that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people don't believe some of the best of</v>

1856
01:23:51.391 --> 01:23:52.840
<v Speaker 5>the way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a long time ago.</v>

1857
01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:53.980
<v Speaker 5>How old are you now?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1858
01:23:53.981 --> 01:23:55.360
<v Speaker 5>I'm 37,000.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ninety one.</v>

1859
01:23:55.361 --> 01:23:56.260
<v Speaker 5>That was the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh Gee shit.</v>

1860
01:23:56.310 --> 01:23:57.620
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

1861
01:23:57.900 --> 01:23:59.260
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>gi surgery.</v>

1862
01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:00.113
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's.</v>

1863
01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:02.560
<v Speaker 5>And do my piano teacher right now is </v>
<v Speaker 5>like owens,</v>

1864
01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:04.990
<v Speaker 5>totally trans friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like we're friends.</v>

1865
01:24:04.991 --> 01:24:07.840
<v Speaker 5>But I don't think he realizes what's it </v>
<v Speaker 5>become,</v>

1866
01:24:08.380 --> 01:24:10.510
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because it's like now it's like,</v>

1867
01:24:10.511 --> 01:24:12.010
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't believe in making a three year</v>

1868
01:24:12.011 --> 01:24:13.690
<v Speaker 5>old a year full of Hay.</v>

1869
01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:14.833
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is,</v>

1870
01:24:14.870 --> 01:24:18.870
<v Speaker 6>this is not wise because if you just </v>
<v Speaker 6>look at it in,</v>

1871
01:24:18.950 --> 01:24:21.650
<v Speaker 6>not in terms of like how a child should </v>
<v Speaker 6>identify,</v>

1872
01:24:21.860 --> 01:24:25.550
<v Speaker 6>but in terms of like the biological </v>
<v Speaker 6>process of a developing human being,</v>

1873
01:24:25.551 --> 01:24:27.320
<v Speaker 6>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 6>very touch and go.</v>

1874
01:24:27.470 --> 01:24:30.230
<v Speaker 6>We don't really understand what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is what you should try to do,</v>

1875
01:24:30.231 --> 01:24:31.064
<v Speaker 6>what a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you just try to give them nutrients you </v>

1876
01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:33.713
<v Speaker 6>should try to give them love and try to </v>
<v Speaker 6>give them safety and try to give them </v>

1877
01:24:36.711 --> 01:24:39.050
<v Speaker 6>challenges.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Totally tends to get over,</v>

1878
01:24:39.051 --> 01:24:39.884
<v Speaker 6>but.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But the idea that you are going to </v>

1879
01:24:40.941 --> 01:24:45.941
<v Speaker 6>decide by your conversation with someone</v>
<v Speaker 6>who just started talking 12 months ago,</v>

1880
01:24:46.070 --> 01:24:48.410
<v Speaker 6>they're still shitting themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They don't know how to talk yet.</v>

1881
01:24:48.440 --> 01:24:49.273
<v Speaker 6>They shit in their pants,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they literally don't know how to </v>

1882
01:24:51.051 --> 01:24:51.880
<v Speaker 6>talk yet.</v>

1883
01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:53.650
<v Speaker 5>I know it's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I identify.</v>

1884
01:24:53.651 --> 01:24:55.070
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how the fuck does that work?</v>

1885
01:24:55.071 --> 01:24:58.120
<v Speaker 5>Do you want to be a girl?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like my son's dances,</v>

1886
01:24:58.150 --> 01:25:00.160
<v Speaker 5>like he's always dancing and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He goes to the piano.</v>

1887
01:25:00.161 --> 01:25:00.994
<v Speaker 5>He does with dad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That does and it's like this kid's </v>

1888
01:25:02.681 --> 01:25:06.190
<v Speaker 5>probably trying to impress his dad and </v>
<v Speaker 5>his dad's this fucking asshole.</v>

1889
01:25:06.460 --> 01:25:07.281
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1890
01:25:07.281 --> 01:25:08.114
<v Speaker 5>being trans is brave dad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then they're gonna make they're </v>

1891
01:25:10.541 --> 01:25:12.820
<v Speaker 5>gonna make moves where the kid can't go </v>
<v Speaker 5>back,</v>

1892
01:25:12.821 --> 01:25:14.730
<v Speaker 5>can't go back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's life is over you.</v>

1893
01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:16.520
<v Speaker 5>You literally turned.</v>

1894
01:25:16.830 --> 01:25:20.580
<v Speaker 6>I live down a dark path because here's </v>
<v Speaker 6>the thing,</v>

1895
01:25:20.730 --> 01:25:24.780
<v Speaker 6>and this is super unpopular to say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the bottom line,</v>

1896
01:25:24.810 --> 01:25:27.420
<v Speaker 6>whether you decide to become a </v>
<v Speaker 6>transgender person,</v>

1897
01:25:27.421 --> 01:25:29.410
<v Speaker 6>whether you decide to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1898
01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:30.473
<v Speaker 6>just to suppress those ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it is at this current stage of our </v>

1899
01:25:34.861 --> 01:25:35.694
<v Speaker 6>understanding of medical science.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Impossible to actually turn you into a </v>

1900
01:25:38.101 --> 01:25:39.600
<v Speaker 6>warm,</v>
<v Speaker 6>of course six x,</v>

1901
01:25:39.601 --> 01:25:40.434
<v Speaker 6>y,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so we're going to do is have some </v>

1902
01:25:42.931 --> 01:25:47.931
<v Speaker 6>reasonable facsimile and it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 6>be more reasonable in different people.</v>

1903
01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:50.700
<v Speaker 6>And some people they have a slender </v>
<v Speaker 6>frame,</v>

1904
01:25:50.890 --> 01:25:51.723
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some people have built like David tour </v>

1905
01:25:53.010 --> 01:25:54.780
<v Speaker 6>and it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whoa girl,</v>

1906
01:25:54.850 --> 01:25:55.683
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I gotta go like you don't have David </v>

1907
01:25:57.721 --> 01:26:00.480
<v Speaker 6>[inaudible] was big time heavyweight </v>
<v Speaker 6>boxer from the nineties</v>

1908
01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:01.393
<v Speaker 5>and you've touched on our body </v>
<v Speaker 5>dysmorphia with like weight lifters </v>

1909
01:26:03.650 --> 01:26:04.483
<v Speaker 5>where it's like,</v>

1910
01:26:04.490 --> 01:26:05.323
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's certain people that just aren't </v>

1911
01:26:06.171 --> 01:26:08.000
<v Speaker 1>comfortable in their own skin and want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to alter it.</v>

1912
01:26:08.030 --> 01:26:08.863
<v Speaker 1>Like with like fucking rather that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger boobs or cutting your wiener off </v>

1913
01:26:10.991 --> 01:26:12.170
<v Speaker 1>or some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1914
01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:15.830
<v Speaker 1>and as a very big personal liberty guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm all about you doing that.</v>

1915
01:26:15.831 --> 01:26:17.540
<v Speaker 1>But you don't make that decision for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids.</v>

1916
01:26:17.541 --> 01:26:21.530
<v Speaker 1>You don't make the decision for anyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's under the age of comprehension.</v>

1917
01:26:21.531 --> 01:26:23.510
<v Speaker 1>And here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what is that age?</v>

1918
01:26:23.540 --> 01:26:27.390
<v Speaker 1>Because they say that the frontal lobe </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't really fully developed until 25.</v>

1919
01:26:27.490 --> 01:26:28.910
<v Speaker 1>Asked Geico.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1920
01:26:29.350 --> 01:26:30.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't show you.</v>

1921
01:26:30.770 --> 01:26:32.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to insure you as a male.</v>

1922
01:26:32.361 --> 01:26:36.030
<v Speaker 1>The insurance is up until you're 25 </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're not developing a uh,</v>

1923
01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:38.540
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a little earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think girls develop little earlier.</v>

1924
01:26:38.630 --> 01:26:41.000
<v Speaker 1>I now I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm fucking pissed.</v>

1925
01:26:41.001 --> 01:26:43.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm calling some sort of red pill </v>
<v Speaker 1>organization.</v>

1926
01:26:43.460 --> 01:26:44.293
<v Speaker 1>And so long story short,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I make these problematic statements and </v>

1927
01:26:46.191 --> 01:26:47.600
<v Speaker 1>then my agent drops me.</v>

1928
01:26:48.230 --> 01:26:49.063
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how does your agent drop you for saying </v>

1929
01:26:50.331 --> 01:26:54.880
<v Speaker 1>a three year old shouldn't be given </v>
<v Speaker 1>chemicals that kill his Dick and balls.</v>

1930
01:26:55.030 --> 01:26:56.180
<v Speaker 1>That was rocking the boat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1931
01:26:56.181 --> 01:26:57.890
<v Speaker 1>It's a fucking match if you just put it </v>
<v Speaker 1>that way.</v>

1932
01:26:57.891 --> 01:27:02.891
<v Speaker 1>So what you are is pro giving kids dick </v>
<v Speaker 1>killing chemicals.</v>

1933
01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:04.700
<v Speaker 1>Is that what you are?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just let me know.</v>

1934
01:27:04.760 --> 01:27:05.593
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of like when it's like words </v>

1935
01:27:06.501 --> 01:27:08.600
<v Speaker 1>are violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You hold up your fist and you go word or</v>

1936
01:27:08.601 --> 01:27:10.910
<v Speaker 1>violence like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It immediately cuts through this shit,</v>

1937
01:27:10.911 --> 01:27:14.150
<v Speaker 1>but for some reason it's not these days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or is there violence?</v>

1938
01:27:14.390 --> 01:27:15.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

01:29:31.681 --> 01:29:32.514
<v Speaker 1>who he is and what that whole story is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I don't know whether it's true </v>

2005

<v Speaker 1>or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know what I've seen online and I </v>

2008
01:29:44.341 --> 01:29:47.750
<v Speaker 1>even if I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say he is a black guy with like,</v>

01:29:47.790 --> 01:29:49.830
<v Speaker 1>well even if he is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's be honest,</v>

2010
01:29:49.840 --> 01:29:53.040
<v Speaker 1>like I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not Irish,</v>

2011
01:29:53.520 --> 01:29:54.840
<v Speaker 1>but I'm a quarter Irish.</v>

2012
01:29:55.090 --> 01:29:56.370
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you look at me,</v>

2013
01:29:56.371 --> 01:29:58.830
<v Speaker 1>I look like a Guinea look like an </v>
<v Speaker 1>Italian.</v>

2014
01:29:59.180 --> 01:30:00.013
<v Speaker 1>You know why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I'm three quarters Irish or </v>

2015
01:30:02.011 --> 01:30:03.270
<v Speaker 1>three quarters Italian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So fight.</v>

2016
01:30:03.410 --> 01:30:04.680
<v Speaker 1>If someone says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you Irish?</v>

2017
01:30:04.890 --> 01:30:08.130
<v Speaker 1>If I was going on TV,</v>
<v Speaker 1>identifying as Irish man,</v>

2018
01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:12.920
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What people are infinitely more part.</v>

2019
01:30:13.560 --> 01:30:14.970
<v Speaker 1>How much are Irish?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you?</v>

2020
01:30:15.090 --> 01:30:18.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean people would say that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>disingenuous because no one can tell,</v>

2021
01:30:18.180 --> 01:30:22.290
<v Speaker 1>nor does anyone care about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinction between Irish and Italian.</v>

2022
01:30:22.460 --> 01:30:24.120
<v Speaker 1>You would just a European,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2023

<v Speaker 1>no big deal.</v>

2025
01:30:27.480 --> 01:30:28.313
<v Speaker 1>But there's a reality to that because </v>
<v Speaker 1>like what percentage black do you have </v>

2026
01:30:31.861 --> 01:30:33.300
<v Speaker 1>to be where you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a black man?</v>

2027
01:30:33.350 --> 01:30:34.770
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he wants the points.</v>

2028
01:30:35.220 --> 01:30:37.570
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's not even about pride.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you don't.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's real.</v>

2037
01:30:54.040 --> 01:30:56.430
<v Speaker 1>That is essentially it talks about all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

2038
01:30:56.431 --> 01:30:59.170
<v Speaker 1>Real tweet from Owen's thing that I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking,</v>

2039
01:30:59.260 --> 01:31:00.093
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we did some shit that I've been tricked </v>

2040
01:31:01.670 --> 01:31:05.070
<v Speaker 1>about so I could create that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a guy,</v>

2041
01:31:05.700 --> 01:31:09.780
<v Speaker 1>there was a guy that I was following for</v>
<v Speaker 1>a while that had a parody account and he</v>

2042
01:31:09.781 --> 01:31:10.614
<v Speaker 1>was going by Hashtag wrong skin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a comedian and he was always </v>

2043
01:31:14.371 --> 01:31:17.040
<v Speaker 1>talking about himself as being trans </v>
<v Speaker 1>racial,</v>

2044
01:31:17.160 --> 01:31:21.170
<v Speaker 1>but he was doing it like completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>preposterous and he would be like,</v>

2045
01:31:21.190 --> 01:31:22.023
<v Speaker 1>you take like the ultra progressive </v>
<v Speaker 1>really ridiculous approach to like </v>

2046
01:31:24.961 --> 01:31:28.680
<v Speaker 1>almost every argument and then always </v>
<v Speaker 1>write like Hashtag wrong skin.</v>

2047
01:31:28.740 --> 01:31:30.960
<v Speaker 1>Hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it all started because that dude</v>

2048
01:31:30.961 --> 01:31:31.794
<v Speaker 1>poked at me because I had this bit that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to be a progressive slave owner </v>

2049
01:31:34.500 --> 01:31:35.820
<v Speaker 1>where I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2050
01:31:35.821 --> 01:31:38.610
<v Speaker 1>the reason slavery is wrong is because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's only black people.</v>

2051
01:31:38.611 --> 01:31:40.020
<v Speaker 1>That's not right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's racism.</v>

2052
01:31:40.021 --> 01:31:41.340
<v Speaker 1>I want all the people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

2053
01:31:41.341 --> 01:31:43.140
<v Speaker 1>if you can't outrun the nuts in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>harpoons.</v>

2054
01:31:43.141 --> 01:31:43.974
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>welcome to the club and that's a joke </v>

2055
01:31:45.271 --> 01:31:48.870
<v Speaker 1>about the absurdity of certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>progressive ideals.</v>

2056
01:31:48.871 --> 01:31:51.420
<v Speaker 1>And then he poked at me somehow and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2057
01:31:52.020 --> 01:31:53.610
<v Speaker 1>this guy's fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2058
01:31:53.611 --> 01:31:56.490
<v Speaker 1>if I can be really honest about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw fit and I was like,</v>

2059
01:31:56.550 --> 01:31:58.140
<v Speaker 1>hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see your point,</v>

2060
01:31:58.141 --> 01:32:00.400
<v Speaker 1>but I think that's like first draft</v>

2061
01:32:00.910 --> 01:32:01.743
<v Speaker 3>of an idea of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I bailed on the joke because it </v>

2062
01:32:05.171 --> 01:32:06.850
<v Speaker 3>doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it only works in certain cities,</v>

2063
01:32:07.160 --> 01:32:09.550
<v Speaker 3>but this is why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is how I felt.</v>

2064
01:32:09.551 --> 01:32:10.384
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2065
01:32:10.600 --> 01:32:11.433
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I don't want anybody to be </v>

2066
01:32:12.581 --> 01:32:13.414
<v Speaker 3>slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like so like the joke is like it's kind </v>

2067
01:32:15.251 --> 01:32:16.084
<v Speaker 3>of cruel in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we're not talking about real </v>

2068
01:32:19.361 --> 01:32:20.210
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>

2069
01:32:20.290 --> 01:32:23.440
<v Speaker 3>the sentiment behind it is people who </v>
<v Speaker 3>run slow.</v>

2070
01:32:23.590 --> 01:32:25.680
<v Speaker 3>Anybody who can't get away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she'd be a slave.</v>

2071
01:32:26.030 --> 01:32:26.910
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no read,</v>

2072
01:32:26.980 --> 01:32:27.813
<v Speaker 3>but you don't really feel that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're saying that because you want to </v>

2073
01:32:31.150 --> 01:32:32.350
<v Speaker 3>poke people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2074
01:32:32.351 --> 01:32:34.690
<v Speaker 3>it was extremely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was honestly,</v>

2075
01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:37.150
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want any slaves.</v>

2076
01:32:37.151 --> 01:32:39.640
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was always the upside down,</v>

2077
01:32:40.390 --> 01:32:41.370
<v Speaker 3>upside down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Satire.</v>

2078
01:32:41.410 --> 01:32:42.330
<v Speaker 3>Weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because that was.</v>

2079
01:32:42.350 --> 01:32:45.970
<v Speaker 3>I was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that it wasn't right.</v>

2080
01:32:46.090 --> 01:32:48.100
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't quite there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like you,</v>

2081
01:32:48.101 --> 01:32:50.830
<v Speaker 3>you were in the neighborhood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's what our job is.</v>

2082
01:32:50.960 --> 01:32:52.690
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the whole thing.</v>

2083
01:32:52.691 --> 01:32:56.470
<v Speaker 3>It's like everyone thinks that you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you start knowing the bit,</v>

2084
01:32:56.890 --> 01:32:57.723
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2085
01:32:57.880 --> 01:32:58.713
<v Speaker 3>freedom of speech is all about way </v>
<v Speaker 3>overshooting then pulling back then </v>

2086
01:33:01.181 --> 01:33:02.014
<v Speaker 3>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2087
01:33:02.020 --> 01:33:04.140
<v Speaker 3>and I was overshooting like that's what </v>
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>

2088
01:33:04.141 --> 01:33:09.040
<v Speaker 3>Why don't they laugh where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at how this one phrase hurts people</v>

2089
01:33:09.041 --> 01:33:12.280
<v Speaker 3>and then how you make it not hurt people</v>
<v Speaker 3>based on information I didn't previously</v>

2090
01:33:12.281 --> 01:33:13.140
<v Speaker 3>know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2091
01:33:13.180 --> 01:33:14.140
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's like,</v>

2092
01:33:14.141 --> 01:33:16.980
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my wife gave me info about.</v>

2093
01:33:16.990 --> 01:33:17.823
<v Speaker 3>I was doing some bit about how vampires </v>
<v Speaker 3>or cultural appropriation for Romanians </v>

2094
01:33:20.981 --> 01:33:24.640
<v Speaker 3>and I don't even understand what the </v>
<v Speaker 3>point was,</v>

2095
01:33:24.641 --> 01:33:26.320
<v Speaker 3>but it's something to do with Harry </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mexicans,</v>

2096
01:33:26.750 --> 01:33:28.270
<v Speaker 3>women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is this?</v>

2097
01:33:28.850 --> 01:33:30.550
<v Speaker 3>W Jamie woody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You trying to find it?</v>

2098
01:33:30.551 --> 01:33:31.384
<v Speaker 3>He was one in looking for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He apparently had hit it or deleted </v>

2099
01:33:35.171 --> 01:33:36.004
<v Speaker 3>those tweets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now Shaun King is cranking out a </v>

2100
01:33:38.651 --> 01:33:39.484
<v Speaker 3>boatload of original tweets in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>continued effort to dilute last week's </v>

2101
01:33:43.271 --> 01:33:44.104
<v Speaker 3>Hashtag,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trans black and Hashtag wrong skin </v>

2102
01:33:46.121 --> 01:33:46.954
<v Speaker 3>tweets.</v>

2103
01:33:47.110 --> 01:33:47.943
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you got a bad response to the know </v>

2104
01:33:50.980 --> 01:33:54.670
<v Speaker 3>tweeting about that whole thing for </v>
<v Speaker 3>weeks and going on into 2016 and a bunch</v>

2105
01:33:54.671 --> 01:33:54.971
<v Speaker 3>of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2106
01:33:54.971 --> 01:33:56.860
<v Speaker 3>I don't give a fuck man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you want to,</v>

2107
01:33:57.170 --> 01:33:58.003
<v Speaker 3>I feel the same,</v>
<v Speaker 3>literally the same way as you feeling </v>

2108
01:34:01.001 --> 01:34:04.870
<v Speaker 3>that you are a woman or you feeling </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything,</v>

2109
01:34:04.930 --> 01:34:05.763
<v Speaker 3>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the real problem is like the </v>

2110
01:34:07.631 --> 01:34:12.631
<v Speaker 3>insisting on that definition in a very </v>
<v Speaker 3>specific manner that's disingenuous with</v>

2111
01:34:14.141 --> 01:34:18.610
<v Speaker 3>your actual background because everyone </v>
<v Speaker 3>is essentially.</v>

2112
01:34:19.480 --> 01:34:20.313
<v Speaker 3>We all came from Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the original human beings and </v>

2113
01:34:23.621 --> 01:34:24.454
<v Speaker 3>like we said before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being white is solar panels for vitamin </v>

2114
01:34:27.671 --> 01:34:28.870
<v Speaker 3>D.</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's all it is.</v>

2115
01:34:29.170 --> 01:34:30.003
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We moved to a place that had a lot of </v>

2116
01:34:30.851 --> 01:34:31.684
<v Speaker 3>clouds and it wasn't anything like </v>
<v Speaker 3>Africa and slowly over who knows how </v>

2117
01:34:34.421 --> 01:34:38.920
<v Speaker 3>many fucking years people changed and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you develop paler and Paler skin.</v>

2118
01:34:39.160 --> 01:34:40.140
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2119
01:34:40.180 --> 01:34:42.040
<v Speaker 3>so it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't care,</v>

2120
01:34:42.250 --> 01:34:44.590
<v Speaker 3>but just here's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's a better way to do it.</v>

2121
01:34:44.950 --> 01:34:45.783
<v Speaker 3>Just act the way you feel like you'd </v>
<v Speaker 3>like to act and don't lie about what </v>

2122
01:34:50.471 --> 01:34:51.580
<v Speaker 3>your background is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>

2123
01:34:51.581 --> 01:34:54.070
<v Speaker 3>And you can be the exact same person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one will give a fuck.</v>

2124
01:34:54.071 --> 01:34:58.040
<v Speaker 3>And the irony is he's trying to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>victim status when he's</v>

2125
01:34:58.040 --> 01:34:58.873
<v Speaker 1>not part of a group and because there is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason American slavery is so </v>

2126
01:35:01.521 --> 01:35:02.354
<v Speaker 1>fucking dark is because it was one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the only slave systems based on one </v>

2127
01:35:06.171 --> 01:35:07.004
<v Speaker 1>race.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why like Carlin did an </v>

2128
01:35:08.541 --> 01:35:09.374
<v Speaker 1>unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything's car like dude Carlin's </v>

2129
01:35:11.030 --> 01:35:13.010
<v Speaker 1>covered it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has a blitz episode called,</v>

2130
01:35:13.011 --> 01:35:14.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>addicted to bondage.</v>

2131
01:35:14.281 --> 01:35:15.200
<v Speaker 1>Dan Carlin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2132
01:35:15.201 --> 01:35:18.350
<v Speaker 1>Dan devcon covered a lot of thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were talking about it did.</v>

2133
01:35:18.351 --> 01:35:22.550
<v Speaker 1>I got some of the wolf in May,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like Dan Carlin addicted to bondage.</v>

2134
01:35:22.551 --> 01:35:24.760
<v Speaker 1>We're all related to slaves and slave </v>
<v Speaker 1>owners.</v>

2135
01:35:24.761 --> 01:35:25.461
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

2136
01:35:25.461 --> 01:35:28.130
<v Speaker 1>it was actually progressive because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>genocide.</v>

2137
01:35:28.580 --> 01:35:29.413
<v Speaker 1>That's the irony.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like back in the day and army </v>

2138
01:35:30.831 --> 01:35:32.060
<v Speaker 1>winds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they kill everyone.</v>

2139
01:35:32.360 --> 01:35:33.980
<v Speaker 1>And then some Bernie Sanders guy was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2140
01:35:33.981 --> 01:35:35.690
<v Speaker 1>let's keep something alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

2141
01:35:35.691 --> 01:35:37.570
<v Speaker 1>you're such a fucking lefty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

2142
01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:40.040
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so we grew out of that.</v>

2143
01:35:40.041 --> 01:35:40.760
<v Speaker 1>Thank God.</v>

2144
01:35:40.760 --> 01:35:42.920
<v Speaker 1>Of course I don't like slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm,</v>

2145
01:35:42.980 --> 01:35:43.813
<v Speaker 1>I'm almost in this position where like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a little freaked out that some </v>

2146
01:35:47.330 --> 01:35:49.700
<v Speaker 1>givens aren't given any more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

2147
01:35:49.790 --> 01:35:52.820
<v Speaker 1>Like like that Hitler is bad or I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>like slavery where I'm like,</v>

2148
01:35:53.040 --> 01:35:54.650
<v Speaker 1>it's just a given.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a given.</v>

2149
01:35:55.080 --> 01:35:56.900
<v Speaker 1>Like who the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like slavery.</v>

2150
01:35:56.901 --> 01:35:57.734
<v Speaker 1>It's like owning a human.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's still a bunch of retards out </v>

2151
01:35:59.661 --> 01:36:02.030
<v Speaker 1>there that think it's a good idea to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>a white nationalist.</v>

2152
01:36:02.031 --> 01:36:02.940
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2153
01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:04.353
<v Speaker 1>Like Charlottesville,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when you see that guy got pepper </v>

2154
01:36:05.841 --> 01:36:06.860
<v Speaker 1>sprayed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>takes his shirt off,</v>

2155
01:36:06.861 --> 01:36:09.050
<v Speaker 1>you see a swastika on his chest like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2156
01:36:09.260 --> 01:36:10.093
<v Speaker 1>what about the Nazis is awesome to you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it just fucking gassing random </v>

2157
01:36:14.211 --> 01:36:15.044
<v Speaker 1>children?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2159
01:36:17.691 --> 01:36:18.524
<v Speaker 1>A bad war plan and Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that are you so fucking stupid </v>

2160
01:36:21.711 --> 01:36:22.544
<v Speaker 1>that you really think the only people of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Merit have a genetics that come from a </v>

2161
01:36:26.031 --> 01:36:27.080
<v Speaker 1>certain patch of dirt?</v>

2162
01:36:27.380 --> 01:36:31.550
<v Speaker 1>Because that was one of the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the most toxic ideas.</v>

2163
01:36:31.610 --> 01:36:34.040
<v Speaker 1>So toxic man share and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2164
01:36:34.050 --> 01:36:37.760
<v Speaker 1>it's toxic in the same way that some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the left shit is toxic too and they both</v>

2165
01:36:37.761 --> 01:36:41.360
<v Speaker 1>have this toxic element where like </v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you look at merit and character,</v>

2166
01:36:41.361 --> 01:36:43.220
<v Speaker 1>you're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're like,</v>

2167
01:36:43.221 --> 01:36:44.054
<v Speaker 1>I'm rather or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think white people are special and </v>

2168
01:36:46.641 --> 01:36:48.890
<v Speaker 1>then you should keep them down or boost </v>
<v Speaker 1>them up.</v>

2169
01:36:48.950 --> 01:36:49.783
<v Speaker 1>It's both toxic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think like when it comes to Rachel </v>

2170
01:36:52.670 --> 01:36:53.503
<v Speaker 1>Dolezal like her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her problem is not that she wants to be </v>

2171
01:36:56.211 --> 01:36:57.044
<v Speaker 1>black and she's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her problem is that people give a fuck </v>

2172
01:36:59.901 --> 01:37:03.170
<v Speaker 1>about what she wants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She just didn't have that land.</v>

2173
01:37:03.220 --> 01:37:07.460
<v Speaker 1>It just didn't like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine her whole world could be exactly</v>

2174
01:37:07.461 --> 01:37:11.030
<v Speaker 1>the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way she behaves could be exactly the</v>

2175
01:37:11.031 --> 01:37:13.550
<v Speaker 1>same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way she dresses her actions,</v>

2176
01:37:13.580 --> 01:37:14.413
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If she didn't utter a few words that </v>

2177
01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:19.130
<v Speaker 1>like I'm actually black and people like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait what?</v>

2178
01:37:19.590 --> 01:37:21.230
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they go into her history.</v>

2179
01:37:21.231 --> 01:37:21.381
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2180
01:37:21.381 --> 01:37:21.570
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2181
01:37:21.570 --> 01:37:22.403
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2182
01:37:23.270 --> 01:37:25.460
<v Speaker 1>you want it to be black but you weren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>black.</v>

2183
01:37:25.630 --> 01:37:27.510
<v Speaker 1>You look right.</v>

2184
01:37:29.960 --> 01:37:31.040
<v Speaker 1>And that just quick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quick,</v>

2185
01:37:31.041 --> 01:37:32.000
<v Speaker 1>quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just eyeballs.</v>

2186
01:37:32.030 --> 01:37:32.863
<v Speaker 1>Shaun king,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was a part of black lives </v>

2187
01:37:33.891 --> 01:37:35.750
<v Speaker 1>matter obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to do good.</v>

2188
01:37:35.751 --> 01:37:39.740
<v Speaker 1>Obviously he wanted to spread good ideas</v>
<v Speaker 1>and help people.</v>

2189
01:37:39.741 --> 01:37:41.510
<v Speaker 1>The people that he really identified </v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

2190
01:37:41.740 --> 01:37:45.530
<v Speaker 1>if those tweets are real and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know if they are Hashtag [inaudible] and</v>

2191
01:37:45.531 --> 01:37:48.920
<v Speaker 1>Hashtag trans racial and all that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that's literally how he felt.</v>

2192
01:37:49.130 --> 01:37:51.020
<v Speaker 1>He didn't feel it because he hated those</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

2193
01:37:51.021 --> 01:37:51.854
<v Speaker 1>He felt because he identified with them </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're more attractive to him than </v>

2194
01:37:54.090 --> 01:37:54.923
<v Speaker 1>than what he actually was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if he just Paul Walden and never </v>

2195
01:37:59.881 --> 01:38:00.930
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean Paul Wall,</v>

2196
01:38:00.931 --> 01:38:02.430
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The wrapper with the grill.</v>

2197
01:38:02.640 --> 01:38:03.473
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't that essentially he's a deep love </v>

2198
01:38:06.091 --> 01:38:08.370
<v Speaker 1>of black American culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2199
01:38:08.380 --> 01:38:12.510
<v Speaker 1>Mean there's a lot of people that just </v>
<v Speaker 1>just be themselves and go in.</v>

2200
01:38:12.680 --> 01:38:14.340
<v Speaker 1>Just go in is what I appreciate more.</v>

2201
01:38:14.340 --> 01:38:18.120
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of black people at golf </v>
<v Speaker 1>clubs with fucking Polo shirts on.</v>

2202
01:38:18.150 --> 01:38:19.350
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

2203
01:38:19.351 --> 01:38:21.810
<v Speaker 1>Because they identify with that culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's appealing to them.</v>

2204
01:38:22.110 --> 01:38:24.460
<v Speaker 1>We'll just let people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking cultures,</v>

2205
01:38:24.480 --> 01:38:25.580
<v Speaker 1>everything man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That people.</v>

2206
01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:29.520
<v Speaker 1>And the irony is is Joey Diaz,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to get us grills.</v>

2207
01:38:29.940 --> 01:38:30.773
<v Speaker 1>You heard about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the irony is is like inner city </v>

2208
01:38:32.881 --> 01:38:33.714
<v Speaker 1>black culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like things like comes to my shows and </v>

2209
01:38:35.551 --> 01:38:38.490
<v Speaker 1>thinks I'm funny because they liked that</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy shit.</v>

2210
01:38:39.210 --> 01:38:40.290
<v Speaker 1>Like man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fucking funny,</v>

2211
01:38:40.440 --> 01:38:43.110
<v Speaker 1>you free to talk about things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just think it's funny.</v>

2212
01:38:43.111 --> 01:38:44.100
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think uh,</v>

2213
01:38:44.470 --> 01:38:46.580
<v Speaker 1>when I say they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's annoying because it's like,</v>

2214
01:38:46.620 --> 01:38:48.810
<v Speaker 1>of course not all black people finding </v>
<v Speaker 1>funny,</v>

2215
01:38:48.811 --> 01:38:51.740
<v Speaker 1>but like that culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that black redneck white liberal culture</v>

2216
01:38:51.741 --> 01:38:56.240
<v Speaker 1>where it's like I'm from a culture </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's more similar to American southern</v>

2217
01:38:56.250 --> 01:38:57.083
<v Speaker 1>or urban black culture than a lot of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>liberals calling me names and it's just </v>

2218
01:39:00.401 --> 01:39:03.120
<v Speaker 1>this type of culture that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that bonds through shit talking,</v>

2219
01:39:03.121 --> 01:39:05.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Boston where it's like if you talk,</v>

2220
01:39:05.580 --> 01:39:06.361
<v Speaker 1>if someone's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2221
01:39:06.361 --> 01:39:08.210
<v Speaker 1>you're dead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're dead x like a home.</v>

2222
01:39:08.210 --> 01:39:08.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>A winter is a big thing to make it </v>

2227
01:39:17.911 --> 01:39:21.180
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people in the west coast have like a</v>

2228
01:39:21.181 --> 01:39:22.014
<v Speaker 1>way easier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the idea of what the possibilities </v>

2229
01:39:25.591 --> 01:39:27.290
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the people that the,</v>

2230
01:39:27.420 --> 01:39:28.253
<v Speaker 1>the east coast people in the East Coast </v>
<v Speaker 1>are regularly confronted with potential </v>

2231
01:39:31.770 --> 01:39:34.050
<v Speaker 1>death if they're dressed wrong.</v>

<v Speaker 2>If you saw a boat in the distance and </v>

2281
01:41:46.021 --> 01:41:48.330
<v Speaker 2>that boat and a dragon head at the front</v>
<v Speaker 2>of it and you're like,</v>

2282
01:41:48.360 --> 01:41:49.380
<v Speaker 2>oh fuck.</v>

2283
01:41:49.430 --> 01:41:50.090
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

2284
01:41:50.090 --> 01:41:52.740
<v Speaker 2>They just wrote a across an ocean and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there were giant,</v>

2285
01:41:52.950 --> 01:41:53.783
<v Speaker 2>giant time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My ancestors probably a little smaller </v>

2286
01:41:57.571 --> 01:41:59.070
<v Speaker 2>because it didn't get proper food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2287
01:41:59.190 --> 01:42:00.820
<v Speaker 2>I got better at giant back then was like</v>
<v Speaker 2>six,</v>

2288
01:42:00.830 --> 01:42:02.580

<v Speaker 2>I did breastfeed for awhile.</v>

2289
01:42:02.910 --> 01:42:05.580
<v Speaker 2>Those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing about Jack Johnson,</v>

2290
01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:09.030
<v Speaker 2>Jack Johnson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was the Galveston giant,</v>

2291
01:42:09.031 --> 01:42:09.864
<v Speaker 2>that's what they called him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you find out Jack Johnson's </v>

2292
01:42:11.461 --> 01:42:14.060
<v Speaker 2>Asheville height.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was the heavyweight champion.</v>

2293
01:42:14.061 --> 01:42:16.740
<v Speaker 2>The were the first black heavyweight </v>
<v Speaker 2>boxing champion of the world.</v>

2294
01:42:17.190 --> 01:42:18.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he was any taller than </v>
<v Speaker 2>six.</v>

2295
01:42:18.581 --> 01:42:19.520
<v Speaker 2>Three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

01:42:24.250 --> 01:42:25.560
<v Speaker 2>seven bloods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2300
01:42:25.561 --> 01:42:27.690

<v Speaker 2>Think about that.</v>

2301
01:42:27.930 --> 01:42:31.170

01:43:28.280 --> 01:43:31.070
<v Speaker 2>He died in some strange way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

2324
01:43:31.250 --> 01:43:34.160
<v Speaker 2>he was only 200 pounds to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a giant back then.</v>

2325
01:43:34.230 --> 01:43:36.290
<v Speaker 2>Imagine that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's so intense.</v>

2326
01:43:36.590 --> 01:43:37.371
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's nuts.</v>

2327
01:43:37.371 --> 01:43:38.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to be like 2:40,</v>

<v Speaker 2>How much you want to 50?</v>

2329
01:43:40.101 --> 01:43:41.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like 15.</v>

2330
01:43:41.271 --> 01:43:43.010
<v Speaker 2>Over two because the beers and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fires.</v>

2331
01:43:43.070 --> 01:43:44.810
<v Speaker 2>Beers and fires everyday.</v>

2332
01:43:44.970 --> 01:43:46.940
<v Speaker 2>Shit Buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fire doesn't put weight on you.</v>

2333
01:43:46.970 --> 01:43:47.803
<v Speaker 2>I know it'd be a drink the beers and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>also makes me cook a lot at meet with </v>

2334
01:43:51.531 --> 01:43:53.780
<v Speaker 2>like fucked up sauces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does it say?</v>

2335
01:43:55.240 --> 01:43:56.073
<v Speaker 2>Does it say his death?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a really interesting thing </v>

2336
01:43:59.361 --> 01:44:00.194
<v Speaker 2>because it's pretty widely believed that</v>
<v Speaker 2>he took a dive when he lost the title </v>

2337
01:44:06.590 --> 01:44:07.423
<v Speaker 2>and then he was just tired of getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>arrested constantly and harassed and he </v>

2338
01:44:11.031 --> 01:44:12.410
<v Speaker 2>just wanted out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was sick.</v>

2339
01:44:12.411 --> 01:44:15.350
<v Speaker 2>A crushing sick of white people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2340
01:44:15.351 --> 01:44:18.110
<v Speaker 2>he's banging a little white chicks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the heat.</v>

2341
01:44:18.140 --> 01:44:20.450
<v Speaker 2>That was some heat back then to it that </v>
<v Speaker 2>I could get you killed.</v>

2342
01:44:20.510 --> 01:44:25.040
<v Speaker 2>That was way before [inaudible] dot com.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we didn't have your bag.</v>

2343
01:44:25.041 --> 01:44:25.760
<v Speaker 2>Him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is.</v>

2344
01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:30.380
<v Speaker 2>He died in a car crash on US highway one</v>
<v Speaker 2>near Franklin,</v>

2345
01:44:30.770 --> 01:44:32.990
<v Speaker 2>North Carolina.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2346
01:44:33.140 --> 01:44:33.973
<v Speaker 2>After racing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>angrily from a diner that refused to </v>

2347
01:44:36.141 --> 01:44:36.974
<v Speaker 2>serve him.</v>

2348
01:44:38.020 --> 01:44:38.853
<v Speaker 2>Pissed dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like the opera closest black </v>

2349
01:44:41.630 --> 01:44:42.463
<v Speaker 2>hospital sake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>St Agnes Hospital in Raleigh and he was </v>

2350
01:44:47.001 --> 01:44:50.310
<v Speaker 2>68 years of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2351
01:44:50.700 --> 01:44:55.700
<v Speaker 2>of age at the time of his death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was buried near at a WHO's,</v>

2352
01:44:55.730 --> 01:44:59.750
<v Speaker 2>I guess his last woman has grave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was initially unmarked,</v>

2353
01:44:59.751 --> 01:45:04.100
<v Speaker 2>but a stone that bears on named Johnson </v>
<v Speaker 2>now stands above the plots of check at a</v>

2354
01:45:04.370 --> 01:45:05.450
<v Speaker 2>Anne Irene.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>

2355
01:45:05.451 --> 01:45:07.880
<v Speaker 2>that's dark man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really crazy.</v>

2356
01:45:07.881 --> 01:45:08.714
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy was just born in the wrong </v>

2357
01:45:11.271 --> 01:45:13.340
<v Speaker 2>fucking time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was bain man.</v>

2358
01:45:13.610 --> 01:45:14.443
<v Speaker 2>That guy was born in darkness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like imagine being black in the fucking </v>

2359
01:45:17.211 --> 01:45:20.030
<v Speaker 2>early 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Holy Shit.</v>

2360
01:45:20.031 --> 01:45:24.720
<v Speaker 2>And he just rose champion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He became the champion and a,</v>

2361
01:45:24.740 --> 01:45:27.230
<v Speaker 2>an interesting style.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you watch the way he fought,</v>

2362
01:45:27.290 --> 01:45:29.570
<v Speaker 2>he fought different if different than </v>
<v Speaker 2>other people.</v>

2363
01:45:30.860 --> 01:45:31.730
<v Speaker 2>What did he do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2364
01:45:31.731 --> 01:45:32.564
<v Speaker 2>he just had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just had a long reach and had really </v>

2365
01:45:34.761 --> 01:45:37.190
<v Speaker 2>good power for the time and he was just </v>
<v Speaker 2>very smart.</v>

2366
01:45:37.520 --> 01:45:40.250
<v Speaker 2>He knew what a drag guys that deep water</v>
<v Speaker 2>and beat the fuck out of him,</v>

2367
01:45:40.550 --> 01:45:41.383
<v Speaker 2>but he fought like a murderous puncher </v>
<v Speaker 2>who's a middleweight champion named </v>

2368
01:45:44.331 --> 01:45:47.880
<v Speaker 2>Stanley Ketchel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a fascinating fight because Stanley</v>

2369
01:45:47.880 --> 01:45:51.110
<v Speaker 2>Ketchel only weighed like 160 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this tiny little dude,</v>

2370
01:45:51.111 --> 01:45:53.870
<v Speaker 2>but it was just a little savage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stanley Catcho,</v>

2371
01:45:54.950 --> 01:45:55.783
<v Speaker 2>Jack Johnson on the Chin and fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>dropped him and it was like a big deal </v>

2372
01:45:59.061 --> 01:45:59.894
<v Speaker 2>at the time because everybody wanted a </v>
<v Speaker 2>white guy to beat the heavyweight title </v>

2373
01:46:02.840 --> 01:46:05.180
<v Speaker 2>holder and the White Guy was way </v>
<v Speaker 2>smaller.</v>

2374
01:46:05.181 --> 01:46:06.710
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look how small catchall is.</v>

2375
01:46:07.070 --> 01:46:07.903
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's fucking way smaller than Jack </v>

2376
01:46:10.160 --> 01:46:13.220
<v Speaker 2>Johnson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Jack Johnson overestimated him.</v>

2377
01:46:13.730 --> 01:46:17.120
<v Speaker 2>And Stanley catcho caught him with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>murderous righthand.</v>

2378
01:46:17.360 --> 01:46:18.193
<v Speaker 2>Stanley Catcho was a savage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was the middleweight champion of the </v>

2379
01:46:21.531 --> 01:46:22.940
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ideas at him.</v>

2380
01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:23.833
<v Speaker 2>Sorry this says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tom Burns to like Mike Tyson's punch </v>

2381
01:46:26.931 --> 01:46:28.640
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beat the shit out of Tommy Burns.</v>

2382
01:46:29.270 --> 01:46:30.680
<v Speaker 2>Go see if you can fight any.</v>

2383
01:46:30.800 --> 01:46:33.860
<v Speaker 2>Slowly tortured him and beat him up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See Find Stanley Ketchel.</v>

2384
01:46:34.910 --> 01:46:37.250
<v Speaker 2>Stanley Catcho was the guy who was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>middleweight champion.</v>

2385
01:46:37.700 --> 01:46:38.533
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a really interesting thing </v>

2386
01:46:41.451 --> 01:46:42.284
<v Speaker 2>because Jack Johnson seems like it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>taking it easy with them for a little </v>

2387
01:46:44.301 --> 01:46:47.210
<v Speaker 2>bit and then capital catches him with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bomb.</v>

2388
01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:49.580
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that it?</v>

2389
01:46:50.020 --> 01:46:51.030
<v Speaker 2>This is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2390
01:46:51.031 --> 01:46:51.864
<v Speaker 2>they had like warmup stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were warming up and they showed </v>

2391
01:46:54.421 --> 01:46:56.310
<v Speaker 2>them training,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how they would train back then.</v>

2392
01:46:56.550 --> 01:46:58.680
<v Speaker 2>It's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody knew what the fuck do.</v>

2393
01:46:59.400 --> 01:47:01.020
<v Speaker 2>I'll just run through the streets and </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

2394
01:47:01.050 --> 01:47:02.670
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't be run.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's awesome.</v>

2395
01:47:02.910 --> 01:47:03.743
<v Speaker 2>They're just trying to figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know that Stanley catchall way </v>

2396
01:47:05.911 --> 01:47:09.420
<v Speaker 2>smaller.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just waste more than Jack Johnson.</v>

2397
01:47:10.080 --> 01:47:12.220
<v Speaker 2>Johnson might've been 30 pounds heavier </v>
<v Speaker 2>than him.</v>

2398
01:47:13.380 --> 01:47:14.213
<v Speaker 2>Maybe even more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think like a mighty mouse could </v>

2399
01:47:15.511 --> 01:47:16.920
<v Speaker 2>take that dude right now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

2400
01:47:16.990 --> 01:47:18.900
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2401
01:47:19.360 --> 01:47:20.730
<v Speaker 2>he wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Boxing.</v>

2402
01:47:20.790 --> 01:47:23.350
<v Speaker 2>But in mma you would never hit him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wears.</v>

2403
01:47:23.780 --> 01:47:24.613
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you figured out some way to stop </v>

2404
01:47:26.071 --> 01:47:29.520
<v Speaker 2>him from moving and him in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's so fast.</v>

2405
01:47:29.700 --> 01:47:30.533
<v Speaker 2>He would anticipate your movement and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>would just slowly dragged these fucking </v>

2406
01:47:33.061 --> 01:47:34.080
<v Speaker 2>guys to the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

2407
01:47:34.090 --> 01:47:35.070
<v Speaker 2>Neil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for Matrix.</v>

2408
01:47:35.071 --> 01:47:38.040
<v Speaker 2>It's like I started watching a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>clips based on your indoor,</v>

2409
01:47:38.070 --> 01:47:38.903
<v Speaker 2>like talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were talking about how he's like </v>

2410
01:47:40.051 --> 01:47:42.870
<v Speaker 2>pound for pound.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just the craziest fighter ever.</v>

2411
01:47:42.871 --> 01:47:43.704
<v Speaker 2>So my best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not the craziest because he </v>

2412
01:47:46.231 --> 01:47:47.940
<v Speaker 2>doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't fight crazy.</v>

2413
01:47:47.941 --> 01:47:49.500
<v Speaker 2>Fight Smart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2414
01:47:49.501 --> 01:47:50.334
<v Speaker 2>see if he could find were canceled,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drops them because it's a big deal </v>

2415
01:47:53.250 --> 01:47:54.083
<v Speaker 2>because nobody expected it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this is already will catch us </v>

2416
01:47:56.161 --> 01:47:57.630
<v Speaker 2>getting fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see his face.</v>

2417
01:48:00.420 --> 01:48:05.040
<v Speaker 2>Oh look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got jacked just back it up.</v>

2418
01:48:05.520 --> 01:48:09.270
<v Speaker 2>Just a hair so we can watch that again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a back of the time.</v>

2419
01:48:09.271 --> 01:48:10.104
<v Speaker 2>This is a giant deal because Stanley </v>
<v Speaker 2>Catcho was a white guy and they were </v>

2420
01:48:14.521 --> 01:48:15.354
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>finally we got a black guy down on the </v>

2421
01:48:18.031 --> 01:48:21.270
<v Speaker 2>ground and it wasn't even a big white </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy that did it,</v>

2422
01:48:21.530 --> 01:48:22.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and everybody wanted Jack,</v>

2423
01:48:23.280 --> 01:48:25.050
<v Speaker 2>Jack Dempsey to come back</v>

2424
01:48:28.900 --> 01:48:29.733
<v Speaker 2>there still there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're still in denial at the point that </v>

2425
01:48:30.971 --> 01:48:33.610
<v Speaker 2>like black people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a serious right hand now.</v>

2426
01:48:33.611 --> 01:48:35.470
<v Speaker 2>I think Jack Dempsey actually was after </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

2427
01:48:35.650 --> 01:48:36.760
<v Speaker 2>Now that I'm thinking about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2428
01:48:36.910 --> 01:48:39.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They wanted Jim Jefferies,</v>

2429
01:48:39.670 --> 01:48:42.990
<v Speaker 2>I think no clue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was it that they want he beat?</v>

2430
01:48:43.110 --> 01:48:45.810
<v Speaker 2>Who did he beat towards the end of his </v>
<v Speaker 2>title reign man,</v>

2431
01:48:45.970 --> 01:48:48.000
<v Speaker 2>my boxing histories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Terrible dude.</v>

2432
01:48:48.001 --> 01:48:49.830
<v Speaker 2>After he got knocked down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was almost like he was like,</v>

2433
01:48:49.831 --> 01:48:50.581
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck this.</v>

2434
01:48:50.581 --> 01:48:51.414
<v Speaker 2>And he just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just went crazy and just took them </v>

2435
01:48:52.321 --> 01:48:53.154
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Literally it was going down before you </v>

2436
01:48:54.021 --> 01:48:54.854
<v Speaker 2>got hit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was weird.</v>

2437
01:48:55.180 --> 01:48:56.013
<v Speaker 2>So that again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might have been that he got caught </v>

2438
01:48:57.601 --> 01:49:01.080
<v Speaker 2>with his legs tied up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Watch this step on the foot.</v>

2439
01:49:01.140 --> 01:49:02.240
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

2440
01:49:02.280 --> 01:49:03.240
<v Speaker 2>One more time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One more time.</v>

2441
01:49:03.241 --> 01:49:06.900
<v Speaker 2>Please watch your step forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He.</v>

2442
01:49:06.901 --> 01:49:10.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was almost like going down because he</v>

2443
01:49:10.741 --> 01:49:15.060
<v Speaker 2>knew the power of the punch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He definitely got clipped though as well</v>

2444
01:49:15.061 --> 01:49:19.260
<v Speaker 2>as also ducking his head and got clipped</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the way down,</v>

2445
01:49:19.261 --> 01:49:20.094
<v Speaker 2>but he was ducking way down where he </v>
<v Speaker 2>might've fallen down or at least fallen </v>

2446
01:49:22.441 --> 01:49:26.130
<v Speaker 2>off balance even if you didn't get hit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but who is this?</v>

2447
01:49:26.790 --> 01:49:27.623
<v Speaker 2>Who's the main do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He went back and forth with go to the </v>

2448
01:49:30.241 --> 01:49:31.074
<v Speaker 2>web to is wikipedia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>James Jeffreys may think it is James </v>

2449
01:49:34.440 --> 01:49:35.273
<v Speaker 2>Jeffreys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2450
01:49:37.330 --> 01:49:42.330
<v Speaker 2>but at the time when this was going on </v>
<v Speaker 2>to have a black heavyweight champion,</v>

2451
01:49:43.540 --> 01:49:44.373
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we can even fathom the </v>

2452
01:49:47.531 --> 01:49:50.230
<v Speaker 2>level of racism this guy experience </v>
<v Speaker 2>unreal.</v>

2453
01:49:50.710 --> 01:49:54.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean literally every day worrying for </v>
<v Speaker 2>his life.</v>

2454
01:49:54.850 --> 01:49:58.000
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile throwing hot dick at white </v>
<v Speaker 2>chicks,</v>

2455
01:49:58.750 --> 01:49:59.583
<v Speaker 2>but it's almost like the gang kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing where it's like that environment </v>

2456
01:50:02.441 --> 01:50:05.680
<v Speaker 2>of just darkness made him such a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>diamond.</v>

2457
01:50:05.920 --> 01:50:10.920
<v Speaker 2>J Neil still lived 20 years old and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ralphie may as I bought her man,</v>

2458
01:50:10.961 --> 01:50:12.640
<v Speaker 2>I was a good dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't good dude.</v>

2459
01:50:12.910 --> 01:50:13.330
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2460
01:50:13.330 --> 01:50:16.030
<v Speaker 2>think about the life of a person that </v>
<v Speaker 2>lived back then.</v>

2461
01:50:16.060 --> 01:50:16.893
<v Speaker 2>He made it 68,</v>
<v Speaker 2>died in a car crash because he was mad </v>

2462
01:50:18.671 --> 01:50:21.480
<v Speaker 2>that a bleachers wouldn't serve him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's cool.</v>

2463
01:50:21.810 --> 01:50:24.850
<v Speaker 2>That's good way to go out though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess it's not the worst way.</v>

2464
01:50:25.220 --> 01:50:26.053
<v Speaker 2>It's quick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's better than being hung by some </v>

2465
01:50:27.071 --> 01:50:28.480
<v Speaker 2>racist for sure.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Being hung with suck.</v>

2467
01:50:31.440 --> 01:50:33.500

<v Speaker 2>If you're going to be executed well,</v>

2468
01:50:33.580 --> 01:50:35.420
<v Speaker 2>what do you pick?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are we really doing this kind of stuff?</v>

<v Speaker 2>If someone knows what they're doing,</v>

<v Speaker 2>He survived and he became a fucking </v>

2509
01:52:09.131 --> 01:52:09.964
<v Speaker 2>maniac.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And tHis was talking about you with </v>

2510
01:52:10.781 --> 01:52:14.710
<v Speaker 2>tomatoes he got on twitter and just lost</v>
<v Speaker 2>his representation.</v>

2511
01:52:15.110 --> 01:52:16.040
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that,</v>

2512
01:52:16.600 --> 01:52:21.430
<v Speaker 2>I think that about myself a lot of times</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I got hit in the head a lot when</v>

2513
01:52:21.431 --> 01:52:22.330
<v Speaker 2>I was young and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2514
01:52:22.331 --> 01:52:26.260
<v Speaker 2>how much does that affect me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Affect my rational thinking?</v>

2515
01:52:26.410 --> 01:52:29.230
<v Speaker 2>How much does it affect my ability to </v>
<v Speaker 2>control my impulses?</v>

2516
01:52:29.680 --> 01:52:30.221
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2517
01:52:30.221 --> 01:52:31.660
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

2518
01:52:31.661 --> 01:52:32.494
<v Speaker 2>I'm on a flight once with michael irvin </v>
<v Speaker 2>and michael irvin who's a really good </v>

2519
01:52:35.441 --> 01:52:38.920
<v Speaker 2>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was talking to me about kids who grow up</v>

2520
01:52:38.950 --> 01:52:42.280
<v Speaker 2>in terrible environments in that these </v>
<v Speaker 2>kids,</v>

2521
01:52:42.281 --> 01:52:46.160
<v Speaker 2>if they're in the room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the womb and their mother</v>

2522
01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:50.810
<v Speaker 3>is experiencing violence or stress or </v>
<v Speaker 3>domestic violence or you know,</v>

2523
01:52:50.811 --> 01:52:51.644
<v Speaker 3>she sees crazy shit that those impulses </v>
<v Speaker 3>go through her body and they directly </v>

2524
01:52:56.811 --> 01:52:57.644
<v Speaker 3>affect the way the fetus develops.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the children who grow up with </v>

2525
01:53:00.801 --> 01:53:01.634
<v Speaker 3>violence around them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like literally they're conceived and </v>

2526
01:53:03.951 --> 01:53:06.770
<v Speaker 3>they have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they develop inside the womb of a mother</v>

2527
01:53:06.771 --> 01:53:07.604
<v Speaker 3>is experiencing all that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have a higher propensity for </v>

2528
01:53:09.921 --> 01:53:11.510
<v Speaker 3>violence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a shorter fuse.</v>

2529
01:53:11.690 --> 01:53:16.010
<v Speaker 3>They're more worried about things going </v>
<v Speaker 3>badly and it was more intense.</v>

2530
01:53:16.280 --> 01:53:20.660
<v Speaker 3>More quick to pull the trigger and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>all of that is a direct response,</v>

2531
01:53:20.661 --> 01:53:21.494
<v Speaker 3>like a biological support system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like your body's trying to keep you </v>

2532
01:53:24.021 --> 01:53:29.021
<v Speaker 3>alive and that the more you encounter </v>
<v Speaker 3>that sort of reinforces that.</v>

2533
01:53:30.110 --> 01:53:33.200
<v Speaker 3>The more times you get hit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more times things hit you,</v>

2534
01:53:33.410 --> 01:53:34.243
<v Speaker 3>the more times you get hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more times you know you crash heads </v>

2535
01:53:36.981 --> 01:53:40.190
<v Speaker 3>as a football player,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get punched in the face as a boxer.</v>

2536
01:53:40.340 --> 01:53:43.790
<v Speaker 3>The more times a tomato hits your </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking dome at 90 miles an hour by some</v>

2537
01:53:43.880 --> 01:53:46.460
<v Speaker 3>kid who thinks it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but whatever it is,</v>

2538
01:53:46.461 --> 01:53:47.294
<v Speaker 3>like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever things that are rattling your </v>

2539
01:53:48.531 --> 01:53:52.880
<v Speaker 3>skull,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those things reinforce your brain's idea</v>

2540
01:53:52.881 --> 01:53:57.630
<v Speaker 3>that violence can come at any moment and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to be prepared and that's that.</v>

2541
01:53:57.890 --> 01:54:01.010
<v Speaker 3>That quick alive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the scorpion and the frog.</v>

2542
01:54:01.011 --> 01:54:01.844
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like your nature keeps you alive </v>

2543
01:54:02.900 --> 01:54:03.733
<v Speaker 3>and that quick trigger I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>translates to various aspects of your </v>

2544
01:54:06.951 --> 01:54:07.784
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just to things where there's a real </v>

2545
01:54:08.961 --> 01:54:10.940
<v Speaker 3>situation you have to deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2546
01:54:10.941 --> 01:54:11.774
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to be able to react quickly </v>

2547
01:54:12.590 --> 01:54:14.480
<v Speaker 3>because your body is programmed to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2548
01:54:14.630 --> 01:54:15.950
<v Speaker 3>I get hit a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm ready.</v>

2549
01:54:15.951 --> 01:54:18.050
<v Speaker 3>When things come to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to fucking fight him off.</v>

2550
01:54:18.051 --> 01:54:20.600
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna fight them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm ready for somebody.</v>

2551
01:54:20.601 --> 01:54:21.440
<v Speaker 3>Talked some shit on twitter.</v>

2552
01:54:21.520 --> 01:54:22.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to say something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kevin shit to you,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna.</v>

2554
01:54:24.650 --> 01:54:26.420
<v Speaker 3>Say something that's going to allow me </v>
<v Speaker 3>to call myself a white nigger.</v>

2555
01:54:26.570 --> 01:54:27.403
<v Speaker 3>I'm reading,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I said at first drives drive crazy </v>

2556
01:54:33.471 --> 01:54:34.304
<v Speaker 3>verbal nuclear weapon on people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like I knew a lot of girls that </v>

2557
01:54:37.401 --> 01:54:39.710
<v Speaker 3>were like a sexually abused kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His kids,</v>

2558
01:54:39.711 --> 01:54:41.420
<v Speaker 3>it became promiscuous because they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2559
01:54:41.421 --> 01:54:42.950
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to fuck you before he fucked </v>
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

2560
01:54:43.730 --> 01:54:44.421
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2561
01:54:44.421 --> 01:54:45.380
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's common.</v>

2562
01:54:45.590 --> 01:54:46.430
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is that,</v>

2563
01:54:46.431 --> 01:54:47.264
<v Speaker 3>but I think there's also something that </v>
<v Speaker 3>happens with people that were sexually </v>

2564
01:54:49.041 --> 01:54:52.370
<v Speaker 3>abused as kids where they become </v>
<v Speaker 3>hypersexual as they get older.</v>

2565
01:54:52.371 --> 01:54:53.900
<v Speaker 3>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>

2566
01:54:54.020 --> 01:54:55.610
<v Speaker 3>it's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2567
01:54:55.611 --> 01:54:57.140
<v Speaker 3>we're not looking at this in a positive </v>
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>

2568
01:54:57.141 --> 01:55:01.700
<v Speaker 3>but I think course activity where we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about when it comes to,</v>

2569
01:55:01.701 --> 01:55:03.620

<v Speaker 3>through a history,</v>

<v Speaker 3>that it was insanely common and it </v>

2571
01:55:08.601 --> 01:55:12.290

<v Speaker 3>thing to do.</v>

2620
01:57:36.280 --> 01:57:37.113
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To help these young kids and he's just </v>

2621
01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:39.833
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why I get furious about the </v>

2622
01:57:41.730 --> 01:57:44.150
<v Speaker 1>people that misrepresent themselves a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot more than the.</v>

2623
01:57:44.570 --> 01:57:46.790
<v Speaker 1>Like there's all these scandals in </v>
<v Speaker 1>hollywood now and,</v>

2624
01:57:46.791 --> 01:57:47.624
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the spaces in the weinsteins of the </v>

2625
01:57:49.621 --> 01:57:52.500
<v Speaker 1>world are so much more dark and evil </v>
<v Speaker 1>than like,</v>

2626
01:57:52.800 --> 01:57:53.633
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's that scan with andy dick and I </v>

2627
01:57:54.690 --> 01:57:55.470
<v Speaker 1>like andy dick.</v>

2628
01:57:55.470 --> 01:57:56.303
<v Speaker 1>I'm like the dudes and obvious dick </v>
<v Speaker 1>robber and he feels bad about it and he </v>

2629
01:57:59.071 --> 01:58:02.040
<v Speaker 1>fucking just wants to get punched.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they asked him what did he,</v>

2630
01:58:02.160 --> 01:58:05.010
<v Speaker 1>what was his initial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was his initial comment?</v>

2631
01:58:05.060 --> 01:58:07.980
<v Speaker 1>Was something like a kissing and licking</v>
<v Speaker 1>his.</v>

2632
01:58:07.981 --> 01:58:08.814
<v Speaker 1>What he does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's been doing it for something like </v>

2633
01:58:09.361 --> 01:58:10.280
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2634
01:58:10.320 --> 01:58:11.153
<v Speaker 1>ma misbehaviors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His middle name or misconduct </v>

2635
01:58:15.450 --> 01:58:17.450
<v Speaker 1>misconduct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're signing up for something.</v>

2636
01:58:17.460 --> 01:58:18.540
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2637
01:58:18.690 --> 01:58:19.650
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2638
01:58:19.710 --> 01:58:20.543
<v Speaker 1>they were upset because they fired him </v>
<v Speaker 1>from an indie film because of sexual </v>

2639
01:58:23.731 --> 01:58:24.840
<v Speaker 1>misconduct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

2640
01:58:26.100 --> 01:58:26.933
<v Speaker 1>I hate to be cynical because I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to say that anybody who wasn't </v>

2641
01:58:30.091 --> 01:58:30.924
<v Speaker 1>victimized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if I was running an indie film that </v>

2642
01:58:33.901 --> 01:58:35.970
<v Speaker 1>was so fucking stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hired andy dick.</v>

2643
01:58:36.420 --> 01:58:41.410
<v Speaker 1>I might be the type of guy that would </v>
<v Speaker 1>make a statement about andy being andy,</v>

2644
01:58:41.760 --> 01:58:43.240
<v Speaker 1>just like we're going to put our foot </v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

2645
01:58:43.410 --> 01:58:48.410
<v Speaker 1>he enough capital and you ever have </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough and then,</v>

2646
01:58:48.671 --> 01:58:49.750
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to see this film,</v>

2647
01:58:49.751 --> 01:58:52.480
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be appearing at the sunset</v>
<v Speaker 1>plaza and blah,</v>

2648
01:58:52.481 --> 01:58:52.891
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>

2649
01:58:52.891 --> 01:58:53.724
<v Speaker 1>It's a good move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least gets people talking about </v>

2650
01:58:55.361 --> 01:58:58.810
<v Speaker 1>something that they would never have </v>
<v Speaker 1>talked about because andy dick hops into</v>

2651
01:58:58.811 --> 01:59:01.750
<v Speaker 1>the river of speculation as to who's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>molester.</v>

2652
01:59:01.960 --> 01:59:03.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like for me,</v>

2653
01:59:03.130 --> 01:59:06.130
<v Speaker 1>he's so much law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he's just,</v>

2654
01:59:06.210 --> 01:59:07.410
<v Speaker 1>he's not going to make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2655
01:59:07.420 --> 01:59:09.430
<v Speaker 1>It's not like the snake in the grass </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you like,</v>

2656
01:59:09.431 --> 01:59:11.210
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy's misrepresenting himself,</v>

2657
01:59:11.211 --> 01:59:12.720
<v Speaker 1>don't cosby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2660
01:59:16.720 --> 01:59:20.920
<v Speaker 1>He's always just like a deep rabbit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He tried to grab my dick.</v>

2661
01:59:20.921 --> 01:59:23.920
<v Speaker 1>I knocked them down and then he </v>
<v Speaker 1>apologized and I was like,</v>

2662
01:59:23.921 --> 01:59:26.320
<v Speaker 1>you're all good man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that you're just freaked out.</v>

01:59:26.380 --> 01:59:29.080
<v Speaker 1>You get excited about weans man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And rita was like,</v>

2664

<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thanks for not really fucking up any </v>

2665
01:59:30.731 --> 01:59:31.540
<v Speaker 1>dag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

2666
01:59:31.540 --> 01:59:33.970
<v Speaker 1>he's vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's vulnerability,</v>

2667
01:59:33.971 --> 01:59:34.804
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like some people are just these </v>

2668
01:59:36.131 --> 01:59:40.570
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable people and like I'm a giant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he's not trying to.</v>

2669
01:59:40.600 --> 01:59:43.460
<v Speaker 1>It's not about power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just blacks out and grabs winners,</v>

2670
01:59:44.110 --> 01:59:47.830
<v Speaker 1>but he's also like in a different way </v>
<v Speaker 1>than you.</v>

2671
01:59:47.831 --> 01:59:48.664
<v Speaker 1>He's a perpetual button pusher but it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily like the worst thing in </v>

2672
01:59:52.271 --> 01:59:55.540
<v Speaker 1>the world to be that button pusher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that is what he is.</v>

2673
01:59:57.070 --> 02:00:01.330
<v Speaker 1>He's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not as competent with it as you.</v>

2674
02:00:01.480 --> 02:00:04.270
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't navigate the waters grabbing </v>
<v Speaker 1>dick's,</v>

2675
02:00:04.360 --> 02:00:05.340
<v Speaker 1>andy's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>

2676
02:00:05.380 --> 02:00:06.213
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's hills and valleys to like your </v>

2677
02:00:08.441 --> 02:00:11.150
<v Speaker 1>interactions with people and like </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's certain hills where you like,</v>

2678
02:00:11.160 --> 02:00:11.993

<v Speaker 1>you could just get way too crazy with </v>

2679

<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You bring it down and he tried to figure</v>

2680
02:00:15.731 --> 02:00:17.500
<v Speaker 1>out what's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's a good middle ground?</v>

2681
02:00:17.710 --> 02:00:19.570
<v Speaker 1>Andy just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all spikes.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's all like ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ground and that's what I have a hard</v>

2683
02:00:25.331 --> 02:00:26.164
<v Speaker 1>time judging people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the pr person I've always been is </v>

2684
02:00:29.231 --> 02:00:30.760
<v Speaker 1>trying to not be judgemental.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the,</v>

2685
02:00:30.761 --> 02:00:33.340
<v Speaker 1>it's the snakes that I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>convicting can changing sunlight,</v>

2733
02:02:29.630 --> 02:02:30.463
<v Speaker 3>sunlight into food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>RIght now we're talking about whacking </v>

2734
02:02:31.851 --> 02:02:32.684
<v Speaker 3>on a plant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's not photosynthesis in the </v>

2735
02:02:33.891 --> 02:02:35.030
<v Speaker 3>plant making shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2736
02:02:35.031 --> 02:02:38.660
<v Speaker 3>But photosynthesis is like the specific </v>
<v Speaker 3>process of,</v>

2737
02:02:38.690 --> 02:02:39.511
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

2738
02:02:39.511 --> 02:02:42.290
<v Speaker 3>of a plant converting sunlight into </v>
<v Speaker 3>energy.</v>

2739
02:02:42.320 --> 02:02:44.180
<v Speaker 3>No emphasis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no impulse control.</v>

2740
02:02:44.300 --> 02:02:46.820
<v Speaker 3>Let's find out what that is because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>could easily be wrong,</v>

2741
02:02:47.030 --> 02:02:49.280
<v Speaker 3>but I thought that photosynthesis meant </v>
<v Speaker 3>converting.</v>

2742
02:02:49.290 --> 02:02:50.130
<v Speaker 3>Turning light.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Light.</v>

2743
02:02:50.150 --> 02:02:51.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's sugar,</v>

2744
02:02:51.430 --> 02:02:52.850
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just not come.</v>

2745
02:02:54.170 --> 02:02:56.830
<v Speaker 3>so turned out bro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

2746
02:02:56.840 --> 02:02:59.030
<v Speaker 3>look aT you making sugar out of sight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2747
02:02:59.031 --> 02:03:00.020
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2748
02:03:00.021 --> 02:03:02.960
<v Speaker 3>okaY.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he got excited by the photosynthesis.</v>

2749
02:03:03.230 --> 02:03:04.063
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the thing is now people are </v>

2750
02:03:04.611 --> 02:03:08.060
<v Speaker 3>starting to treat me like I'm this like </v>
<v Speaker 3>moral high ground guy and I don't wait,</v>

2751
02:03:08.061 --> 02:03:10.250
<v Speaker 3>hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who is doing that because of the fucking</v>

2752
02:03:10.251 --> 02:03:11.450
<v Speaker 3>standing up for three year oLds.</v>

2753
02:03:11.660 --> 02:03:12.411
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

2754
02:03:12.411 --> 02:03:16.060
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't judge one plant whack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not as the difference between the,</v>

2755
02:03:16.430 --> 02:03:17.263
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like transgender three year olds and </v>

2756
02:03:19.130 --> 02:03:22.640
<v Speaker 3>some coked up studio executive course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the thing,</v>

2757
02:03:22.820 --> 02:03:23.653
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to excuse anybody's </v>
<v Speaker 3>behavior that's done anything to </v>

2758
02:03:25.791 --> 02:03:26.624
<v Speaker 3>victimize other people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it is a fascinating aspect of </v>

2759
02:03:29.271 --> 02:03:32.330
<v Speaker 3>hollywood culture that forever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you wanted to get a part,</v>

2760
02:03:32.510 --> 02:03:36.410
<v Speaker 3>you had to go to the casting couch and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody knew it and there was a lot of</v>

2761
02:03:36.411 --> 02:03:41.411
<v Speaker 3>those guys that had disproportionate </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationships like they were disgusting.</v>

2762
02:03:42.170 --> 02:03:45.830
<v Speaker 3>He's disgusting and his wife is fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>smoking.</v>

2763
02:03:46.040 --> 02:03:46.873
<v Speaker 3>Ever seen harvey's wife.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's smoking and no need to bring her </v>

2764
02:03:52.371 --> 02:03:53.204
<v Speaker 3>into this at all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm just explaining like this is a </v>

2765
02:03:55.010 --> 02:03:55.843
<v Speaker 3>consistently disproportionate </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship that exists throughout </v>

2766
02:03:58.161 --> 02:03:58.994
<v Speaker 3>hollywood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's the guy who was insanely </v>

2767
02:04:00.951 --> 02:04:01.784
<v Speaker 3>wealthy but physically vial and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>somehow or another managed to dunk his </v>

2768
02:04:06.141 --> 02:04:10.100
<v Speaker 3>dick and attends before he coaxed </v>
<v Speaker 3>himself into an early grave.</v>

2769
02:04:10.340 --> 02:04:14.060
<v Speaker 3>That is a fucking common common common </v>
<v Speaker 3>theme.</v>

2770
02:04:14.210 --> 02:04:15.043
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not judging that guy who's just </v>

2771
02:04:16.551 --> 02:04:19.580
<v Speaker 3>getting tans when he's a two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the american dream.</v>

2772
02:04:19.581 --> 02:04:21.260
<v Speaker 3>How would you do it though?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly?</v>

2773
02:04:21.261 --> 02:04:23.390
<v Speaker 3>It's about hating limit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's about it is about him,</v>

2774
02:04:23.720 --> 02:04:24.553
<v Speaker 3>but thIs is my point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you do not get to dunk your </v>

2775
02:04:27.201 --> 02:04:31.310
<v Speaker 3>dick intends unless you do all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that that guy did.</v>

2776
02:04:31.340 --> 02:04:33.260
<v Speaker 3>He produce shakespeare in love.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a dictum.</v>

2777
02:04:33.280 --> 02:04:35.240
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not excusing him.</v>

2778
02:04:35.241 --> 02:04:40.241
<v Speaker 3>I'm not exonerating him and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>women do not naturally feel attracted to</v>

2779
02:04:40.981 --> 02:04:43.480
<v Speaker 3>obese guys with bad skin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It isn't.</v>

2780
02:04:43.500 --> 02:04:44.333
<v Speaker 3>This is not a common thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>like in order for him to force the </v>

2781
02:04:47.461 --> 02:04:48.294
<v Speaker 3>outcome that he desires,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he has to cross cultural inappropriate </v>

2782
02:04:51.720 --> 02:04:52.553
<v Speaker 3>boundaries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know like this is just like we're </v>

2783
02:04:54.091 --> 02:04:57.210
<v Speaker 3>dealing with like mathematics or </v>
<v Speaker 3>literally,</v>

2784
02:04:57.211 --> 02:04:58.800
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not exonerating him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

2785
02:04:58.801 --> 02:05:01.410
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe I have to say this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't want anybody taking this out</v>

2786
02:05:01.411 --> 02:05:02.244
<v Speaker 3>of context.</v>

2787
02:05:02.250 --> 02:05:04.440
<v Speaker 3>If you are dealing with this as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>system,</v>

2788
02:05:04.710 --> 02:05:05.543
<v Speaker 3>as a biological system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like say if you're looking at it from </v>

2789
02:05:07.141 --> 02:05:09.390
<v Speaker 3>afar and you had no connection to </v>
<v Speaker 3>culture,</v>

2790
02:05:09.530 --> 02:05:11.730
<v Speaker 3>no connection of civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd be like,</v>

2791
02:05:11.731 --> 02:05:12.510
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is this?</v>

2792
02:05:12.510 --> 02:05:13.343
<v Speaker 3>How does this system working?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how is this one like extremely </v>

2793
02:05:16.741 --> 02:05:21.741
<v Speaker 3>flawed biological entity oozing its way </v>
<v Speaker 3>into these perfect shapes?</v>

2794
02:05:22.380 --> 02:05:23.213
<v Speaker 3>A good finds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a way to penetrate these perfect shapes </v>

2795
02:05:25.141 --> 02:05:25.974
<v Speaker 3>with thin waist and perfect asses and </v>
<v Speaker 3>beautiful faces and his face is just </v>

2796
02:05:29.881 --> 02:05:30.714
<v Speaker 3>this pile of slava numbness and just </v>
<v Speaker 3>discussed and is growing hair on top of </v>

2797
02:05:37.111 --> 02:05:37.944
<v Speaker 3>it and a little fat dick and just shoots</v>
<v Speaker 3>incompetent sperm into the mouths of </v>

2798
02:05:42.061 --> 02:05:43.290
<v Speaker 3>tens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>LIke what?</v>

2799
02:05:43.440 --> 02:05:44.910
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is happening here?</v>

2800
02:05:44.940 --> 02:05:45.773
<v Speaker 3>What is happening here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's happening here is there's no way </v>

2801
02:05:49.141 --> 02:05:50.610
<v Speaker 3>he would've been able to do it any other</v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

2802
02:05:50.880 --> 02:05:53.310
<v Speaker 3>It's like so like he's not thor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2803
02:05:53.310 --> 02:05:56.400
<v Speaker 3>He's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not some fucking Ryan Reynolds type</v>

2804
02:05:56.401 --> 02:06:00.050
<v Speaker 3>character with perfect cheekbones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's just like blah.</v>

2805
02:06:00.240 --> 02:06:01.073
<v Speaker 3>And he's just feeding that back with </v>
<v Speaker 3>coke and fucking booze and blow jobs </v>

2806
02:06:05.491 --> 02:06:06.324
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and constantly trying to put out more </v>

2807
02:06:07.741 --> 02:06:10.530
<v Speaker 3>things that allow us to buy the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking house,</v>

2808
02:06:10.531 --> 02:06:11.364
<v Speaker 3>the highest sales.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I mean this is literally the only </v>

2809
02:06:16.021 --> 02:06:19.140
<v Speaker 3>way he can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can do that as to be disgusting.</v>

2810
02:06:19.500 --> 02:06:21.600
<v Speaker 3>Like girls aren't just going to line up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I loved,</v>

2811
02:06:21.900 --> 02:06:25.830
<v Speaker 3>I loved your movies and I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do it to me what you want.</v>

2812
02:06:25.980 --> 02:06:28.380
<v Speaker 3>You'll get one out of a million that do </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2813
02:06:28.560 --> 02:06:29.393
<v Speaker 3>but that's not enough like they have to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would have to find him through the </v>

2814
02:06:31.411 --> 02:06:32.910
<v Speaker 3>crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not gonna work.</v>

2815
02:06:32.940 --> 02:06:37.590
<v Speaker 3>It's not going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like that crazy mindset,</v>

2816
02:06:37.591 --> 02:06:39.030
<v Speaker 3>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not exonerating,</v>

2817
02:06:39.200 --> 02:06:43.170
<v Speaker 3>not excusing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that mindset of like,</v>

2818
02:06:43.800 --> 02:06:45.810
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is the mindset of someone who wants</v>

2819
02:06:45.811 --> 02:06:47.670
<v Speaker 3>to run the fastest race?</v>

2820
02:06:47.760 --> 02:06:52.760
<v Speaker 3>What is the mindset of someone who wants</v>
<v Speaker 3>to make the fastest jet bike zero to 100</v>

2821
02:06:55.021 --> 02:06:57.200
<v Speaker 3>time we fucking hanging onto these </v>
<v Speaker 3>handlebars.</v>

2822
02:06:57.300 --> 02:06:59.490
<v Speaker 3>What is the mindset of that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

2823
02:06:59.491 --> 02:07:02.240
<v Speaker 3>but it seems to be some sort of bizarre </v>
<v Speaker 3>croissant,</v>

2824
02:07:02.640 --> 02:07:07.560
<v Speaker 3>competitive biological environment where</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are chasing some strange,</v>

2825
02:07:07.830 --> 02:07:09.660
<v Speaker 3>unattainable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>highest ground,</v>

2826
02:07:09.750 --> 02:07:10.171
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2827
02:07:10.171 --> 02:07:12.150
<v Speaker 3>It always comes from a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a slight flaw,</v>

2828
02:07:12.151 --> 02:07:15.630
<v Speaker 3>lIke the sand makes the pearl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The calla comedians are little flood.</v>

2829
02:07:15.631 --> 02:07:19.410
<v Speaker 3>Like somebody come at it and I like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were talking shit,</v>

2830
02:07:19.411 --> 02:07:21.600
<v Speaker 3>but I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're so right to go,</v>

2831
02:07:21.601 --> 02:07:24.000
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Owen is the tallest do with the napoleon</v>

2832
02:07:24.001 --> 02:07:26.550
<v Speaker 3>complex I've ever seen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was like,</v>

2833
02:07:26.551 --> 02:07:30.480
<v Speaker 3>you're fucking right man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like ambition comes from this weird</v>

2834
02:07:30.481 --> 02:07:34.670
<v Speaker 3>like feeling of threat where you're like</v>
<v Speaker 3>at any moment I like,</v>

2835
02:07:34.680 --> 02:07:36.160
<v Speaker 3>I gotta try,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I gotta work really</v>

2836
02:07:36.160 --> 02:07:36.993
<v Speaker 1>hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to work on this bit but it </v>

2837
02:07:38.681 --> 02:07:39.514
<v Speaker 1>just never went anywhere about like um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>civilizations based on cock size where </v>

2838
02:07:42.701 --> 02:07:43.534
<v Speaker 1>you got the japanese and the english </v>
<v Speaker 1>took over the whole world because </v>

2839
02:07:45.641 --> 02:07:47.830
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their chick is like we need more,</v>

2840
02:07:47.831 --> 02:07:48.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your dick.</v>

2841
02:07:48.550 --> 02:07:49.383
<v Speaker 1>No good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then like sub saharan africans have </v>

2842
02:07:51.491 --> 02:07:54.280
<v Speaker 1>these monster hammers and their chicks </v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're not taking over shit.</v>

2843
02:07:54.281 --> 02:07:55.114
<v Speaker 1>You got that big old caulk and they just</v>
<v Speaker 1>stay put exactly where it's almost like </v>

2844
02:07:57.940 --> 02:07:59.920
<v Speaker 1>ambition sometimes can come from </v>
<v Speaker 1>insecurity,</v>

2845
02:07:59.921 --> 02:08:03.400
<v Speaker 1>which I am riddled with and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ambitious people are totally.</v>

2846
02:08:03.500 --> 02:08:04.333
<v Speaker 1>Which is the point that I was making is </v>
<v Speaker 1>like you have to be disgusting to want </v>

2847
02:08:06.791 --> 02:08:07.624
<v Speaker 1>to chase down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tail to the point where you're willing </v>

2848
02:08:08.771 --> 02:08:11.350
<v Speaker 1>to rape as like at that level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2849
02:08:11.440 --> 02:08:14.170
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think like that guy gets a billion</v>

2850
02:08:14.170 --> 02:08:16.000
<v Speaker 1>dollars and he realizes chick still </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to fuck him.</v>

2851
02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.580
<v Speaker 1>And he spirals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't think it matters.</v>

2852
02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:22.030
<v Speaker 1>I think he's constantlY caught up in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pursuit of doing it,</v>

2853
02:08:22.600 --> 02:08:23.433
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think probably it was like super </v>

2854
02:08:24.371 --> 02:08:27.400
<v Speaker 1>exciting to get the young starlet who </v>
<v Speaker 1>like didn't know any better,</v>

2855
02:08:27.401 --> 02:08:28.190
<v Speaker 1>didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't,</v>

2856
02:08:28.190 --> 02:08:29.023
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't really 100 percent sure she was </v>

2857
02:08:30.311 --> 02:08:31.144
<v Speaker 1>gonna make it in hollywood and having </v>
<v Speaker 1>that threat of like controlling her </v>

2858
02:08:34.661 --> 02:08:37.450
<v Speaker 1>career over her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a giant vampire.</v>

2859
02:08:39.250 --> 02:08:42.760
<v Speaker 1>And then that Was the horrific nature of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it for those women.</v>

2860
02:08:42.820 --> 02:08:45.550
<v Speaker 1>That's what's getting people </v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly angry about this.</v>

2861
02:08:45.551 --> 02:08:48.010
<v Speaker 1>Not that he was a fat gross guy trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get laid.</v>

2862
02:08:48.011 --> 02:08:51.610
<v Speaker 1>Like we've seen those throughout the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout human history has always been</v>

2863
02:08:51.611 --> 02:08:52.444
<v Speaker 1>people trying to get laid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but is that he was doing it in a way </v>

2864
02:08:54.161 --> 02:08:56.050
<v Speaker 1>that was victimized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2865
02:08:56.380 --> 02:08:58.450
<v Speaker 1>Costing psychic scars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2866
02:08:58.451 --> 02:09:00.890
<v Speaker 1>Because like what does this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brett ratner,</v>

2867
02:09:00.920 --> 02:09:01.770
<v Speaker 1>same stuff today?</v>

2868
02:09:02.120 --> 02:09:04.330
<v Speaker 1>Well now it's just getting crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like,</v>

2869
02:09:04.360 --> 02:09:07.240
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be like kermit the frog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's under control,</v>

2870
02:09:07.480 --> 02:09:09.010
<v Speaker 1>but it's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'm the opposite.</v>

2871
02:09:09.011 --> 02:09:11.020
<v Speaker 1>I need like a ton of consent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm like,</v>

2872
02:09:11.460 --> 02:09:11.921
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2873
02:09:11.921 --> 02:09:12.930
<v Speaker 1>I like your dick six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

2874
02:09:13.030 --> 02:09:13.863
<v Speaker 1>but you don't love the dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen people like there's </v>

2875
02:09:16.390 --> 02:09:17.223
<v Speaker 1>been people that have said that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should have a consent form and that you </v>

2876
02:09:19.721 --> 02:09:22.120
<v Speaker 1>should videotape the signing of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>consent form?</v>

2877
02:09:22.121 --> 02:09:26.080
<v Speaker 1>I was watching this youtube thing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy was talking about consent forms</v>

2878
02:09:26.350 --> 02:09:27.183
<v Speaker 1>and like that you should get people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sign a consent form and like what </v>

2879
02:09:29.430 --> 02:09:30.263
<v Speaker 1>Michael Jordan does that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if you're like a billionaire </v>

2880
02:09:32.111 --> 02:09:33.610
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like that's fucked up.</v>

2881
02:09:33.611 --> 02:09:36.910
<v Speaker 1>That takes away the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's definitely a different thing.</v>

2882
02:09:37.260 --> 02:09:38.093
<v Speaker 1>It's like what a consent form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a merger and acquisition of </v>

2883
02:09:40.890 --> 02:09:45.040
<v Speaker 1>two companies like your dick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dick ink and pussy corp was like,</v>

2884
02:09:45.310 --> 02:09:46.330
<v Speaker 1>are you cool with this?</v>

2885
02:09:46.330 --> 02:09:48.430
<v Speaker 1>And you gotta sign that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2886
02:09:48.610 --> 02:09:49.443
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're seeing things where people</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't feel cool about it many years </v>

2887
02:09:53.140 --> 02:09:55.750
<v Speaker 1>later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the moment maybe they just let it</v>

2888
02:09:55.751 --> 02:10:00.490
<v Speaker 1>happen and then you decide that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>letting it happen was way worse.</v>

2889
02:10:01.260 --> 02:10:02.093
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they were thinking about it at the </v>

2890
02:10:03.281 --> 02:10:04.114
<v Speaker 1>time and then decided some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual assault and then it spirals </v>

2891
02:10:07.421 --> 02:10:08.660
<v Speaker 1>onward and outward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2892
02:10:09.950 --> 02:10:10.783
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be really nice if people were </v>

2893
02:10:12.581 --> 02:10:14.710
<v Speaker 1>just attracted to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

2894
02:10:14.711 --> 02:10:15.544
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like someone pasted some of these </v>

2895
02:10:17.021 --> 02:10:20.050
<v Speaker 1>people though when they're talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>like eye contact being some shit.</v>

2896
02:10:20.380 --> 02:10:22.900
<v Speaker 1>Like I had a friend like this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is dark,</v>

2897
02:10:22.901 --> 02:10:24.260
<v Speaker 1>but whatever.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I want them to die.</v>

2914
02:11:04.790 --> 02:11:06.200
<v Speaker 5>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2915
02:11:06.201 --> 02:11:09.590
<v Speaker 5>there's a nine month wait,</v>

<v Speaker 5>like texting and coming over with </v>

2917
02:11:13.041 --> 02:11:13.611
<v Speaker 5>condoms,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2918
02:11:13.611 --> 02:11:14.444
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we got to start triaging some of this </v>

2919
02:11:16.071 --> 02:11:16.820
<v Speaker 5>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

2920
02:11:16.820 --> 02:11:19.670
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you gotta we have to be very,</v>

2921
02:11:21.020 --> 02:11:23.990
<v Speaker 6>very strict on both sides of what we </v>
<v Speaker 6>tolerate,</v>

2922
02:11:24.410 --> 02:11:25.220
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and we,</v>

2923
02:11:25.220 --> 02:11:25.661
<v Speaker 6>we,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we,</v>

2924
02:11:25.661 --> 02:11:26.494
<v Speaker 6>we cannot tolerate real rape.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But we also cannot tolerate false </v>

2925
02:11:30.651 --> 02:11:35.651
<v Speaker 6>accusations to 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Cannot tolerate indulgences where people</v>

2926
02:11:35.661 --> 02:11:36.494
<v Speaker 6>have distorted perceptions of reality </v>
<v Speaker 6>and they paint what they know somewhere </v>

2927
02:11:41.240 --> 02:11:45.440
<v Speaker 6>at least subconsciously to be some very </v>
<v Speaker 6>inaccurate interpretation of the events,</v>

2928
02:11:45.470 --> 02:11:47.120
<v Speaker 6>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And we also can't,</v>

2929
02:11:47.900 --> 02:11:48.733
<v Speaker 6>can we,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we can't condone the cosby type shit </v>

2930
02:11:51.381 --> 02:11:53.900
<v Speaker 6>that went on for years.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We can't condone rape.</v>

2931
02:11:54.110 --> 02:11:58.050
<v Speaker 6>We can't condone people who drug people </v>
<v Speaker 6>or abuse people.</v>

2932
02:11:58.110 --> 02:12:00.110
<v Speaker 6>We can't condone that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Don't either.</v>

2933
02:12:00.111 --> 02:12:00.944
<v Speaker 6>One of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I think more importantly is there's </v>

2934
02:12:03.741 --> 02:12:07.670
<v Speaker 6>something going on right now where </v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a hypercharged environment where</v>

2935
02:12:07.671 --> 02:12:11.840
<v Speaker 6>people are terrified of being called out</v>
<v Speaker 6>and people are like waiting,</v>

2936
02:12:11.841 --> 02:12:13.490
<v Speaker 6>like looking around like what's gonna </v>
<v Speaker 6>happen next?</v>

2937
02:12:13.640 --> 02:12:14.473
<v Speaker 6>And then people are thinking about some </v>
<v Speaker 6>shit that happened to him a long time </v>

2938
02:12:16.761 --> 02:12:17.211
<v Speaker 6>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2939
02:12:17.211 --> 02:12:20.010
<v Speaker 6>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 6>This has been fucking sitting in my craw</v>

2940
02:12:20.011 --> 02:12:22.640
<v Speaker 6>for 18 years.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Dustin hoffman.</v>

2941
02:12:22.850 --> 02:12:25.970
<v Speaker 6>It's time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The world knows and not like hard boiled</v>

2942
02:12:25.971 --> 02:12:26.780
<v Speaker 6>eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Dustin,</v>

2943
02:12:26.780 --> 02:12:29.510
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what's true and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 6>know what's not true.</v>

2944
02:12:29.511 --> 02:12:32.720
<v Speaker 6>I do not know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I cannot comment and no one can,</v>

2945
02:12:32.960 --> 02:12:33.793
<v Speaker 6>but it's this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's something that's going on where </v>

2946
02:12:35.990 --> 02:12:39.290
<v Speaker 6>this I would hope and I.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is what I always hope.</v>

2947
02:12:39.530 --> 02:12:43.460
<v Speaker 6>I always hope that any wave that goes </v>
<v Speaker 6>this way eventually goes that way.</v>

2948
02:12:43.580 --> 02:12:46.970
<v Speaker 6>And I hope that any outrage leads to </v>
<v Speaker 6>more understanding.</v>

2949
02:12:47.090 --> 02:12:49.760
<v Speaker 6>Yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all of this stuff and all of this,</v>

2950
02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:50.833
<v Speaker 6>especially this fucking rape shit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that I feel like there's more rape talk </v>

2951
02:12:54.530 --> 02:12:55.363
<v Speaker 6>today and more understanding of how many</v>
<v Speaker 6>girls get approached or fucked with or </v>

2952
02:12:59.901 --> 02:13:00.734
<v Speaker 6>harassed or even actually raped or </v>
<v Speaker 6>drugged than we ever thought before </v>

2953
02:13:04.580 --> 02:13:05.413
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm hoping this conversation leads to </v>

2954
02:13:08.450 --> 02:13:09.283
<v Speaker 6>more understanding early on in people's </v>
<v Speaker 6>lives before they formed this idea of </v>

2955
02:13:12.891 --> 02:13:14.570
<v Speaker 6>what is and isn't acceptable.</v>

2956
02:13:14.690 --> 02:13:15.523
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because that's a good thing from it is </v>

2957
02:13:16.511 --> 02:13:19.490
<v Speaker 5>it is making people be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't treat women this way,</v>

2958
02:13:19.520 --> 02:13:20.080

02:13:20.080 --> 02:13:20.913
<v Speaker 6>young kids here at early for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but hear it when you're young so that </v>

2960
02:13:23.911 --> 02:13:24.744
<v Speaker 6>you don't ever grow up in some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 6>an environment where the people around </v>

2961
02:13:27.091 --> 02:13:31.040
<v Speaker 6>you tell you it's okay that it's us </v>
<v Speaker 6>versus them and fuck those bitches.</v>

<v Speaker 6>to fuck you.</v>

<v Speaker 6>he's an ineffective process.</v>

2982
02:14:22.770 --> 02:14:23.603
<v Speaker 6>He's a trial and error process and you </v>
<v Speaker 6>can't judge someone tiredly by the </v>

2983
02:14:26.851 --> 02:14:28.500
<v Speaker 6>errors,</v>
<v Speaker 6>forgiveness and growth.</v>

<v Speaker 6>And the woman is a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And another thing is we can't keep </v>

<v Speaker 6>image of it and they send it to me.</v>

2999
02:15:17.160 --> 02:15:18.780
<v Speaker 6>Whether they tooK it themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It said,</v>

3000
02:15:19.140 --> 02:15:21.480
<v Speaker 6>eliminate masculinity.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Ah,</v>

3001
02:15:22.280 --> 02:15:27.280
<v Speaker 6>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when the vikings come and do that,</v>

3002
02:15:27.451 --> 02:15:28.284
<v Speaker 6>good a need.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Men in the most masculine guys I know </v>

3003
02:15:30.421 --> 02:15:32.550
<v Speaker 6>are the least likely to fucking rape </v>
<v Speaker 6>anybody.</v>

3004
02:15:32.580 --> 02:15:34.770
<v Speaker 6>They're the ones that defend women.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

3005
02:15:34.771 --> 02:15:36.500
<v Speaker 6>there's a few women are attracted to.</v>

3006
02:15:36.610 --> 02:15:37.443
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's,</v>

3007
02:15:37.810 --> 02:15:40.290
<v Speaker 6>there's some dark law.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you know what?</v>

3008
02:15:40.350 --> 02:15:42.090
<v Speaker 6>Here's the thing about a lot of those </v>
<v Speaker 6>dark people,</v>

3009
02:15:42.260 --> 02:15:44.020
<v Speaker 6>the dark,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like the color.</v>

3010
02:15:44.110 --> 02:15:45.840
<v Speaker 6>I mean he meant pigment john.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I didn't,</v>

3011
02:15:45.900 --> 02:15:46.733
<v Speaker 6>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I didn't.</v>

3012
02:15:47.170 --> 02:15:48.750
<v Speaker 6>The dark mindset,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

3013
02:15:48.760 --> 02:15:49.593
<v Speaker 6>the predatorY rapist mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a ton of those people that come </v>

3014
02:15:54.841 --> 02:15:59.310
<v Speaker 6>directly from trauma that come from </v>
<v Speaker 6>being violated themselves.</v>

3015
02:15:59.460 --> 02:16:00.293
<v Speaker 6>TheY come from being in bad situations.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They come from being programmed </v>

3016
02:16:03.241 --> 02:16:05.070
<v Speaker 6>incorrectly and exempt.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Again.</v>

3017
02:16:05.071 --> 02:16:07.710
<v Speaker 6>I'm not exonerating them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not excusing them.</v>

3018
02:16:07.920 --> 02:16:08.753
<v Speaker 6>I'm just thinking that it would do us </v>
<v Speaker 6>all a world of good if we could look at </v>

3019
02:16:11.851 --> 02:16:14.070
<v Speaker 6>these people from afar.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I didn't experience that.</v>

3020
02:16:14.220 --> 02:16:16.320
<v Speaker 6>I didn't grow up in a familY filled with</v>
<v Speaker 6>crime.</v>

3021
02:16:16.350 --> 02:16:19.570
<v Speaker 6>I didn't grow up in a family filled with</v>
<v Speaker 6>violence and murder and,</v>

3022
02:16:19.590 --> 02:16:19.990
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

3023
02:16:19.990 --> 02:16:22.650
<v Speaker 6>and I did a neighborhood filled with </v>
<v Speaker 6>people robbing people left and right.</v>

3024
02:16:22.651 --> 02:16:23.484
<v Speaker 6>I didn't grow up with thAt.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So my looking at it as a complete third </v>

3025
02:16:26.791 --> 02:16:30.430
<v Speaker 6>party outsider.</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I'm thinking I try</v>

3026
02:16:30.430 --> 02:16:35.430
<v Speaker 1>to pretend to imagine what it was like </v>
<v Speaker 1>to grow up in watts in the 19 sixties.</v>

3027
02:16:35.800 --> 02:16:36.633
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Try to pretend what it was like to be </v>

3028
02:16:38.220 --> 02:16:40.360
<v Speaker 1>incompetent in the nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>TrY to pretend.</v>

3029
02:16:40.361 --> 02:16:41.194
<v Speaker 1>Well this is where I think transcends </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is still cruelty because like all </v>

3030
02:16:43.991 --> 02:16:47.560
<v Speaker 1>hang with legit gang members and feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>safe when you're hanging with cameras.</v>

3031
02:16:47.600 --> 02:16:48.433
<v Speaker 1>Well I'll do like cleveland and bravo </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then afterwards I'm smokinG blondes </v>

3032
02:16:51.911 --> 02:16:53.710
<v Speaker 1>with like dudes that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3033
02:16:53.711 --> 02:16:57.430
<v Speaker 1>have leveland improv has gang members </v>
<v Speaker 1>waiting for some fucking people.</v>

3034
02:16:57.431 --> 02:16:58.264
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

3035
02:16:58.360 --> 02:17:00.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's wearing a bulls hat and a city</v>

3036
02:17:00.311 --> 02:17:01.144
<v Speaker 1>without red or like someone's got </v>
<v Speaker 1>teardrop tattoos and like I don't feel </v>

3037
02:17:05.201 --> 02:17:07.960
<v Speaker 1>scared because I don't like if they have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a body count,</v>

3038
02:17:07.961 --> 02:17:08.794
<v Speaker 1>it's because of threats and business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like cruelty and I think that </v>

3039
02:17:12.371 --> 02:17:14.890
<v Speaker 1>there's even in like fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 1>environments,</v>

3040
02:17:14.891 --> 02:17:18.070
<v Speaker 1>you still have the cruel man and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>good man,</v>

3041
02:17:18.071 --> 02:17:22.330
<v Speaker 1>even if they like do things that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't agree with in your social economic</v>

3042
02:17:22.490 --> 02:17:22.790
<v Speaker 1>area.</v>

3043
02:17:22.790 --> 02:17:24.070
<v Speaker 1>THat's the hero's journey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3044
02:17:24.120 --> 02:17:28.780
<v Speaker 1>The strong person that's kind enough to </v>
<v Speaker 1>take care of the people that are weak.</v>

3045
02:17:28.960 --> 02:17:30.640
<v Speaker 1>That's what the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what everybody wants,</v>

3046
02:17:30.641 --> 02:17:31.474
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>As someone who is a strong person that </v>

3047
02:17:32.261 --> 02:17:33.094
<v Speaker 1>looks out for the week person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why everybody like the term </v>

3048
02:17:36.311 --> 02:17:38.410
<v Speaker 1>bully,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think it's overused,</v>

3049
02:17:38.550 --> 02:17:41.290
<v Speaker 1>like sometimes bullying gets used when </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are equals in.</v>

3050
02:17:41.291 --> 02:17:42.670
<v Speaker 1>When someone is critiquing someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3051
02:17:42.671 --> 02:17:43.960
<v Speaker 1>you're a bully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

3052
02:17:44.830 --> 02:17:46.480
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think that's stupid.</v>

3053
02:17:46.660 --> 02:17:49.140
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't make me a bullet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're using it wrong.</v>

3054
02:17:49.160 --> 02:17:51.160
<v Speaker 1>This is not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not talking about children.</v>

3055
02:17:51.280 --> 02:17:53.650
<v Speaker 1>We're not talking about people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>physically weaker than me.</v>

3056
02:17:53.920 --> 02:17:54.753
<v Speaker 1>Like let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's be clear about what the fuck we </v>

3057
02:17:56.051 --> 02:17:58.270
<v Speaker 1>mean when we say this very polarizing </v>
<v Speaker 1>word,</v>

3058
02:17:58.500 --> 02:17:59.333
<v Speaker 1>but that word is polarizing because we </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely don't want to be the person </v>

3059
02:18:02.771 --> 02:18:05.740
<v Speaker 1>that's in the position of physical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>moral,</v>

3060
02:18:05.800 --> 02:18:07.390
<v Speaker 1>ethical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>economic,</v>

3061
02:18:07.391 --> 02:18:08.224
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>superiority who has influence over the </v>

3062
02:18:09.941 --> 02:18:12.820
<v Speaker 1>other person's life and steps in and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucks with it.</v>

3063
02:18:12.940 --> 02:18:14.200
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what it.</v>

3064
02:18:14.320 --> 02:18:15.970
<v Speaker 1>That's what a bully is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spine,</v>

3065
02:18:16.090 --> 02:18:17.800
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With passion can be like,</v>

3066
02:18:17.801 --> 02:18:20.200
<v Speaker 1>fuck these people and people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3067
02:18:20.201 --> 02:18:24.070
<v Speaker 1>even if you're a little off the mark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not trying to hurt people to make</v>

3068
02:18:24.071 --> 02:18:25.960
<v Speaker 1>yourself feel better for your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>inadequacies.</v>

3069
02:18:25.961 --> 02:18:27.790
<v Speaker 1>That's what's evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or if you are,</v>

3070
02:18:27.791 --> 02:18:29.770
<v Speaker 1>you need to understand that that's what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing,</v>

3071
02:18:29.860 --> 02:18:30.880
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we're all equal.</v>

3072
02:18:30.881 --> 02:18:32.830
<v Speaker 1>We're all evil and good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just make the move.</v>

3073
02:18:32.860 --> 02:18:36.100
<v Speaker 1>But also just to have someone like </v>
<v Speaker 1>pointed out makes you go,</v>

3074
02:18:36.340 --> 02:18:37.990
<v Speaker 1>am I like and think about it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

3075
02:18:37.991 --> 02:18:42.250
<v Speaker 1>you're not necessarily your words and </v>
<v Speaker 1>your actions,</v>

3076
02:18:42.370 --> 02:18:43.203
<v Speaker 1>which you are as how you've dealt with </v>
<v Speaker 1>your past words and actions and make </v>

3077
02:18:47.591 --> 02:18:48.401
<v Speaker 1>corrections.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3078
02:18:48.401 --> 02:18:49.690
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really what you are.</v>

3079
02:18:50.140 --> 02:18:50.973
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what's really important </v>

3080
02:18:52.060 --> 02:18:53.920
<v Speaker 1>because if we don't give people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>leeway,</v>

3081
02:18:53.921 --> 02:18:56.650
<v Speaker 1>they don't ever learn from their </v>
<v Speaker 1>mistakes.</v>

3082
02:18:56.820 --> 02:18:57.653
<v Speaker 1>they don't ever learn from their </v>
<v Speaker 1>mistakes than we were essentially </v>

3083
02:19:01.241 --> 02:19:05.530
<v Speaker 1>committing to a future with no one </v>
<v Speaker 1>learning anything.</v>

3084
02:19:05.830 --> 02:19:06.960
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3085
02:19:07.100 --> 02:19:11.110
<v Speaker 1>And it's like I gave on dave smith and </v>
<v Speaker 1>steven crowder both this a compliment.</v>

3086
02:19:11.140 --> 02:19:11.973
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because even if you disagree with </v>

3087
02:19:12.491 --> 02:19:14.860
<v Speaker 1>someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing I love about people is like if</v>

3088
02:19:14.861 --> 02:19:15.694
<v Speaker 1>you make a good point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they look excited and happy versus </v>

3089
02:19:18.461 --> 02:19:19.294
<v Speaker 1>threatened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you're not on the path that I'm </v>

3090
02:19:21.521 --> 02:19:22.354
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're still trying to like carve your </v>

3091
02:19:24.011 --> 02:19:28.190
<v Speaker 1>fucking sculpture with it to look </v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful and not a threatening posture.</v>

3092
02:19:28.230 --> 02:19:29.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that has nothing to do with the left</v>

3093
02:19:29.571 --> 02:19:31.610
<v Speaker 1>or the right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's really Just how you approach</v>

3094
02:19:31.611 --> 02:19:32.540
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3095
02:19:32.570 --> 02:19:33.890
<v Speaker 1>To all 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3096
02:19:33.891 --> 02:19:34.724
<v Speaker 1>Because I think a lot of times people </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the right do not want to accept </v>

3097
02:19:38.481 --> 02:19:41.300
<v Speaker 1>good ideas from the left and vice verse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's just a,</v>

3098
02:19:41.301 --> 02:19:42.950
<v Speaker 1>that's a real issue that people have.</v>

3099
02:19:43.070 --> 02:19:46.910
<v Speaker 1>And that's a weakness too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a weakness and I've experienced it</v>

3100
02:19:46.911 --> 02:19:50.150
<v Speaker 1>from my own mind and I'm sure you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>from yours,</v>

3101
02:19:50.420 --> 02:19:51.350
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've seen my twitter.</v>

3102
02:19:51.890 --> 02:19:52.723
<v Speaker 1>Everybody has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's important that we realize like </v>

3103
02:19:55.311 --> 02:19:56.144
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is that reaction that we had and </v>

3104
02:19:57.681 --> 02:19:58.514
<v Speaker 1>how do we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do we mitigate the negative aspects </v>

3105
02:20:00.171 --> 02:20:01.004
<v Speaker 1>of it and how do we figure out how we </v>
<v Speaker 1>got to that point where we said </v>

3106
02:20:03.291 --> 02:20:05.480
<v Speaker 1>something maybe we didn't believe or we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

3107
02:20:05.481 --> 02:20:06.121
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

3108
02:20:06.121 --> 02:20:10.670
<v Speaker 1>we reacted to something in a way where </v>
<v Speaker 1>if given time to reconsider our,</v>

3109
02:20:10.760 --> 02:20:12.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the potential going this way with it are</v>

3110
02:20:12.891 --> 02:20:15.020
<v Speaker 1>that way with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd probably come up with a better idea</v>

3111
02:20:15.220 --> 02:20:17.960
<v Speaker 1>and a cool thing you do for men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially men,</v>

3112
02:20:17.961 --> 02:20:18.794
<v Speaker 1>because I could speak on behalf of men </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I identify with the winter and </v>

3113
02:20:20.031 --> 02:20:20.840
<v Speaker 1>balls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

3115
02:20:21.760 --> 02:20:24.470
<v Speaker 1>you make people think about their </v>
<v Speaker 1>actions where it's like,</v>

3116
02:20:25.030 --> 02:20:27.500
<v Speaker 1>but I think about mine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about yours too,</v>

3117
02:20:27.501 --> 02:20:30.020
<v Speaker 1>which is why we gravitate to each other </v>
<v Speaker 1>100 percent where it's like,</v>

3118
02:20:30.530 --> 02:20:31.340
<v Speaker 1>is this good?</v>

3119
02:20:31.340 --> 02:20:33.680

<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3140
02:21:14.391 --> 02:21:15.224

<v Speaker 1>justify it with my association with </v>

3141
02:21:18.291 --> 02:21:21.620
<v Speaker 1>people that you fucking could have </v>

<v Speaker 1>supremacist like,</v>

3156
02:21:49.730 --> 02:21:52.430
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see what you're trying to do and it is</v>

3157
02:21:52.431 --> 02:21:56.210
<v Speaker 1>so transparent that it minimizes </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything you're ever going to say ever</v>

3158
02:21:56.211 --> 02:21:58.370
<v Speaker 1>from this point on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on this subject,</v>

3159
02:21:58.490 --> 02:22:00.050
<v Speaker 1>because I always have to think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3160
02:22:00.051 --> 02:22:02.100
<v Speaker 1>you're intentions are disingenuous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3161
02:22:02.101 --> 02:22:05.240
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to do is divert people </v>
<v Speaker 1>from tHe actual reality.</v>

3162
02:22:05.270 --> 02:22:08.270
<v Speaker 1>so this shaun king guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe he's a really good guy.</v>

3163
02:22:08.700 --> 02:22:10.250
<v Speaker 1>He's just a white guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a dickhead.</v>

3164
02:22:10.310 --> 02:22:14.320
<v Speaker 1>Well he's a white guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he's a good guy.</v>

3165
02:22:14.321 --> 02:22:15.154
<v Speaker 1>It could be an albino nigerian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he's that and I don't </v>

3166
02:22:17.031 --> 02:22:17.864
<v Speaker 1>think so either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks just like his dad and his </v>

3167
02:22:18.711 --> 02:22:22.570
<v Speaker 1>brother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he's a really good guy and this is</v>

3168
02:22:22.571 --> 02:22:23.404
<v Speaker 1>just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He hangs out with the wrong people and </v>

3169
02:22:24.960 --> 02:22:26.040
<v Speaker 1>as the wrong ideas in his</v>

3170
02:22:26.040 --> 02:22:26.873
<v Speaker 3>head and he's followed the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 3>operating system to a in a logical </v>

3171
02:22:32.160 --> 02:22:32.993
<v Speaker 3>perspective where the only way to </v>
<v Speaker 3>disagree with is to call you a guy </v>

3172
02:22:36.631 --> 02:22:39.900
<v Speaker 3>married to a home depot mexican or white</v>
<v Speaker 3>supremacist.</v>

3173
02:22:41.640 --> 02:22:44.760
<v Speaker 3>It's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you love your wife joe.</v>

02:22:49.831 --> 02:22:52.770
<v Speaker 3>I've known you for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're the opposite of a racist.</v>

3178
02:22:52.800 --> 02:22:53.910
<v Speaker 3>You're just not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3179
02:22:53.911 --> 02:22:56.250
<v Speaker 3>It's so fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like right now in 2070.</v>

3180
02:22:56.251 --> 02:22:57.084
<v Speaker 3>It's like if you're truly not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you sound almost racist because you're </v>

3181
02:22:59.791 --> 02:23:00.900
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

3182
02:23:00.901 --> 02:23:02.470

<v Speaker 3>to marginalize normal people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's another mcdonald's.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the answer is,</v>

3210
02:24:18.250 --> 02:24:22.610
<v Speaker 3>but you can't say that now have no </v>
<v Speaker 3>repercussions for your actions.</v>

3211
02:24:22.611 --> 02:24:23.444
<v Speaker 3>You can't say all white straight men who</v>
<v Speaker 3>identify as men are shit until proven </v>

3212
02:24:29.491 --> 02:24:32.710

02:24:33.780 --> 02:24:34.613
<v Speaker 3>homophobic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's stupid because if that was the </v>

3215
02:24:36.781 --> 02:24:37.950
<v Speaker 3>case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we were all shit,</v>

3216
02:24:38.130 --> 02:24:43.130
<v Speaker 3>it would be a damn rape festival in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>streets of every major city all over the</v>

3217
02:24:43.951 --> 02:24:44.784
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you really thought that we were all </v>

3218
02:24:46.111 --> 02:24:48.990
<v Speaker 3>bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me tell you what all bad looks like.</v>

3219
02:24:49.380 --> 02:24:50.213
<v Speaker 3>All bad looks like the world filled with</v>
<v Speaker 3>coked up vikings just running through </v>

3220
02:24:55.201 --> 02:24:57.540
<v Speaker 3>this tree mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking everybody you've ever met.</v>

3221
02:24:57.780 --> 02:25:00.900
<v Speaker 3>That's what men can do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not bragging,</v>

3222
02:25:01.140 --> 02:25:02.820
<v Speaker 3>but that's what if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you,</v>

3223
02:25:02.910 --> 02:25:03.743
<v Speaker 3>if you have lingerie on and you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>close your eyes and walk through a </v>

3224
02:25:07.711 --> 02:25:10.440
<v Speaker 3>football field in front of a large </v>
<v Speaker 3>crowd,</v>

3225

<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

3227
02:25:19.441 --> 02:25:24.130

<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>

3228
02:25:24.190 --> 02:25:25.150
<v Speaker 1>That's why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3229
02:25:25.151 --> 02:25:25.984
<v Speaker 1>I'm convinced that's why they keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming at like white american dudes </v>

3230
02:25:28.961 --> 02:25:31.300

<v Speaker 1>they're coming at us for a reason and I </v>

3233
02:25:35.290 --> 02:25:38.050
<v Speaker 1>want to say us now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't have a rape culture though.</v>

3234
02:25:38.051 --> 02:25:38.570
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

3235
02:25:38.570 --> 02:25:40.570
<v Speaker 1>we see a rapist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We go fuck that guy,</v>

<v Speaker 1>but the problem is uNtil now there </v>

3237
02:25:45.491 --> 02:25:50.390
<v Speaker 1>wasn't enough of an ability to express </v>
<v Speaker 1>what written and on both sides,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You were both drunk and it was </v>

3240
02:25:54.311 --> 02:25:55.990
<v Speaker 1>consensual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but It's rain say ruin.</v>

3241

<v Speaker 1>A dude's life falls for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's happened and I had fattiest </v>

3242
02:25:59.111 --> 02:25:59.944

<v Speaker 1>they're both lIke over 18.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They di,</v>

3245
02:26:06.790 --> 02:26:09.430
<v Speaker 1>they got drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they decided to have sex.</v>

02:26:12.850 --> 02:26:13.683
<v Speaker 1>They agreed to get together and after </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact the girls friends decided that </v>

3249
02:26:19.151 --> 02:26:21.730
<v Speaker 1>it was sexual assault because she was </v>
<v Speaker 1>intoxicated,</v>

3250
02:26:21.880 --> 02:26:25.270
<v Speaker 1>not even taking into account.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were both intoxicated,</v>

3251
02:26:25.290 --> 02:26:26.123
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both agreed and there was text messages </v>

3252
02:26:27.581 --> 02:26:28.414
<v Speaker 1>back and forth.</v>

3253
02:26:30.160 --> 02:26:34.100
<v Speaker 1>Remorse does not equal rape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Having a bad experience.</v>

3254
02:26:34.101 --> 02:26:34.934
<v Speaker 1>Percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Both for the guy and the girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just like people fuck up and</v>

3256

<v Speaker 1>You got to figure out what is and what </v>

3257
02:26:42.791 --> 02:26:43.624
<v Speaker 1>isn't.</v>

<v Speaker 1>no repercussions,</v>

3259

<v Speaker 1>but the boy was sober.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Life is over cross.</v>

3260
02:26:52.060 --> 02:26:52.893
<v Speaker 1>there were two people who are attracted </v>
<v Speaker 1>to each other who were exchanging text </v>

3261
02:26:56.171 --> 02:26:57.004

<v Speaker 1>Because I have that instinct of like,</v>

3279
02:27:42.861 --> 02:27:43.694
<v Speaker 1>let's look at what it really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it really just two kids that got </v>

3280
02:27:46.331 --> 02:27:47.164
<v Speaker 1>intoxicated and had intercourse with </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other and then one of them felt </v>

3281
02:27:49.931 --> 02:27:50.980
<v Speaker 1>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>god damn.</v>

3282
02:27:50.981 --> 02:27:52.540
<v Speaker 1>How many times do you feel bad about </v>
<v Speaker 1>sex?</v>

3283
02:27:52.750 --> 02:27:54.340
<v Speaker 1>Because a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because It's almost like that,</v>

3284
02:27:54.341 --> 02:27:54.850
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

3285
02:27:54.850 --> 02:27:59.850
<v Speaker 1>that thing of like the leprechaun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he got caught the leprechaun.</v>

3286
02:28:00.130 --> 02:28:02.350
<v Speaker 1>It's like an old parable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's real short.</v>

3287
02:28:02.351 --> 02:28:03.184
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to drag on a parable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like elaborate guy got caught and </v>

3288
02:28:05.501 --> 02:28:06.170
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

3290
02:28:07.120 --> 02:28:11.110

<v Speaker 1>So he put the ribbon on all the trees.</v>

3291
02:28:11.320 --> 02:28:14.320
<v Speaker 1>So now the ribbon doesn't mean shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So everything's rape.</v>

3292
02:28:14.321 --> 02:28:16.420
<v Speaker 1>Rape isn't rape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like if everything is racist,</v>

3293
02:28:16.421 --> 02:28:18.160
<v Speaker 1>racism isn't racism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>

3294
02:28:18.161 --> 02:28:18.994
<v Speaker 1>you're now taking away our ability to </v>
<v Speaker 1>identify predators and it's a dude's </v>

3295
02:28:22.521 --> 02:28:23.360
<v Speaker 1>like us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

3296
02:28:23.390 --> 02:28:25.190
<v Speaker 1>I promise ladies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I promise you,</v>

3297
02:28:25.191 --> 02:28:26.024
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if a guy breaks about rape will fuck </v>

3298
02:28:27.441 --> 02:28:30.020
<v Speaker 1>that dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like no one likes that guy.</v>

3299
02:28:30.040 --> 02:28:32.930
<v Speaker 1>You're in a small enough community where</v>
<v Speaker 1>people feel responsibility.</v>

3300
02:28:33.350 --> 02:28:36.320
<v Speaker 1>That's the big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read about this once.</v>

3301
02:28:36.321 --> 02:28:37.154
<v Speaker 1>This is a phrase called diffusion of </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility that happens in a large </v>

3302
02:28:40.551 --> 02:28:42.230
<v Speaker 1>group of people that see something </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

3303
02:28:42.530 --> 02:28:43.363
<v Speaker 1>Like there was a picture it genevieve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where she got killed in front of 40 </v>

3304
02:28:45.441 --> 02:28:47.360
<v Speaker 1>people in New York city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly,</v>

3305
02:28:47.600 --> 02:28:51.890
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a picture of video rather from</v>

3306
02:28:51.891 --> 02:28:52.724
<v Speaker 1>chicago.</v>

3307
02:28:52.880 --> 02:28:54.770
<v Speaker 1>Really recently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See if you can find jamie.</v>

3308
02:28:54.980 --> 02:28:59.540
<v Speaker 1>We're a guy assaults a woman and he did </v>
<v Speaker 1>it on a security camera.</v>

3309
02:28:59.570 --> 02:29:04.130
<v Speaker 1>He had kicked her and knocked her out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was fucking awful.</v>

3310
02:29:04.250 --> 02:29:07.550
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what led to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this guy punched her.</v>

3311
02:29:07.640 --> 02:29:11.930
<v Speaker 1>And then I mean like still skillfully </v>
<v Speaker 1>head kicked her.</v>

3312
02:29:11.960 --> 02:29:14.780
<v Speaker 1>Like he took martial arts before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kod.</v>

3313
02:29:14.930 --> 02:29:17.930
<v Speaker 1>She falls down and a bunch of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>walk over and start filming her.</v>

3314
02:29:18.170 --> 02:29:20.420
<v Speaker 1>She's as.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is one that I,</v>

3315
02:29:20.421 --> 02:29:23.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I retweeted because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think I'm not,</v>

3316
02:29:23.610 --> 02:29:25.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm not entirely sure if I remember </v>
<v Speaker 1>correctly,</v>

3317
02:29:25.791 --> 02:29:27.740
<v Speaker 1>but I think I thought about retweet and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3318
02:29:27.741 --> 02:29:29.360
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't need to see this.</v>

3319
02:29:29.440 --> 02:29:33.110
<v Speaker 1>This is not something I want to promote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And support was someone wrote,</v>

3320
02:29:33.230 --> 02:29:34.063
<v Speaker 1>this is like an episode of black mirror </v>
<v Speaker 1>because this guy kicked this girl and </v>

3321
02:29:38.121 --> 02:29:41.210
<v Speaker 1>instead of calling nine one one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people are filming this girl while</v>

3322
02:29:41.211 --> 02:29:44.070
<v Speaker 1>she's curled up in a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you find it this,</v>

3323
02:29:45.380 --> 02:29:45.680
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

3324
02:29:45.680 --> 02:29:47.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know if I want you to find </v>
<v Speaker 1>it this,</v>

3325
02:29:48.250 --> 02:29:49.083
<v Speaker 1>but this girl curls up into a fetal </v>
<v Speaker 1>position on the sidewalk and they're </v>

3326
02:29:51.951 --> 02:29:53.450
<v Speaker 1>standing around her filming it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3327
02:29:53.451 --> 02:29:54.284
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a big political divide isn't </v>

3328
02:29:57.020 --> 02:29:58.520
<v Speaker 1>good evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah blah blah.</v>

3329
02:29:58.560 --> 02:30:02.030
<v Speaker 1>It's population density.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like cities like what we're talking</v>

3330
02:30:02.031 --> 02:30:03.710
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these monkeys going by each other.</v>

3331
02:30:03.711 --> 02:30:04.544
<v Speaker 1>No one's eating each other's faces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want a powerful government to keep </v>

3332
02:30:07.011 --> 02:30:07.844
<v Speaker 1>it chill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you live in a place with a 40 </v>

3333
02:30:09.231 --> 02:30:12.140
<v Speaker 1>minute police response time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's about individuality.</v>

3334
02:30:12.141 --> 02:30:15.680
<v Speaker 1>And that's when he started going more </v>
<v Speaker 1>libertarian because it's like,</v>

3335
02:30:15.770 --> 02:30:18.500
<v Speaker 1>well I have a gun in chickens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3336
02:30:18.530 --> 02:30:19.363
<v Speaker 1>versus like a big city where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need a powerful government to keep </v>

3337
02:30:22.701 --> 02:30:23.920
<v Speaker 1>everyone relaxed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3338
02:30:23.930 --> 02:30:27.050
<v Speaker 1>you can't always rely on daddy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>daddy,</v>

3339
02:30:27.170 --> 02:30:28.003
<v Speaker 1>daddy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all dude.</v>

3340
02:30:28.010 --> 02:30:30.350
<v Speaker 1>I've seen what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking daddy doesn't do shit.</v>

3341
02:30:30.350 --> 02:30:32.450
<v Speaker 1>Daddy's a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wanted a job being daddy.</v>

3342
02:30:32.810 --> 02:30:34.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what police daddy is,</v>

3343
02:30:34.620 --> 02:30:35.451
<v Speaker 1>please.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Daddy is.</v>

3344
02:30:35.451 --> 02:30:38.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean sometimes you get great guys and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you get fooled.</v>

3345
02:30:39.250 --> 02:30:40.083
<v Speaker 1>It's like across the board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you might run into the best guy </v>

3346
02:30:42.110 --> 02:30:46.220
<v Speaker 1>ever when you're shopping at walgreens </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you might run into a fucking moron.</v>

3347

<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And exactly man.</v>

3348
02:30:47.751 --> 02:30:51.110

<v Speaker 1>And you might've hit the perfect guy.</v>

3349
02:30:51.500 --> 02:30:52.333
<v Speaker 1>And I love the way you describe govs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's the hardest job in the </v>

3350
02:30:54.861 --> 02:30:55.880
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hardest,</v>

3351
02:30:55.881 --> 02:30:57.360
<v Speaker 1>the hardest soldier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you,</v>

3352

<v Speaker 1>cops are going to keep us safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are our fucking warrior heroes.</v>

3365
02:31:17.691 --> 02:31:19.350
<v Speaker 1>You know it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

3366
02:31:19.351 --> 02:31:20.160
<v Speaker 1>THis is a very</v>

3367
02:31:20.160 --> 02:31:20.993
<v Speaker 3>easy thing for me to say when I say I </v>
<v Speaker 3>haven't had a bad experience with cops </v>

3368
02:31:24.540 --> 02:31:26.550
<v Speaker 3>because I haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really haven't.</v>

3369
02:31:26.551 --> 02:31:29.010
<v Speaker 3>I mean I've had cops get mouthy with me </v>
<v Speaker 3>before,</v>

3370
02:31:29.011 --> 02:31:30.930
<v Speaker 3>but I've always said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no sir,</v>

3371
02:31:31.260 --> 02:31:33.190
<v Speaker 3>thank you very much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I've always been like,</v>

3372
02:31:33.360 --> 02:31:35.910
<v Speaker 3>I've always like immediately try to </v>
<v Speaker 3>diffuse the situation,</v>

3373
02:31:35.911 --> 02:31:38.410
<v Speaker 3>but I'm a white guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3374
02:31:38.750 --> 02:31:41.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I speak pretty calmly.</v>

3375
02:31:41.521 --> 02:31:43.530
<v Speaker 3>I am a comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm an entertainer.</v>

3376
02:31:43.531 --> 02:31:45.240
<v Speaker 3>A lot of them know me from the ufc at </v>
<v Speaker 3>this point.</v>

3377
02:31:45.241 --> 02:31:47.640
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like I'm out of the game </v>
<v Speaker 3>right this point.</v>

3378
02:31:47.641 --> 02:31:48.474
<v Speaker 3>Like cops run into me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like almost all cops are fans of the </v>

3379
02:31:50.371 --> 02:31:52.470
<v Speaker 3>ufc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if I run into a cop,</v>

3380
02:31:52.860 --> 02:31:54.900
<v Speaker 3>the cops like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh joe rogan,</v>

3381
02:31:54.930 --> 02:31:55.621
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's up man?</v>

3382
02:31:55.621 --> 02:31:56.071
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

3383
02:31:56.071 --> 02:31:57.660
<v Speaker 3>what's up man?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he realized like,</v>

3384
02:31:57.690 --> 02:31:58.321
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a guy,</v>

3385
02:31:58.321 --> 02:32:00.510
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a terrorist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm not,</v>

3386
02:32:00.511 --> 02:32:01.344
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a criminal.</v>

3387
02:32:01.640 --> 02:32:02.600
<v Speaker 3>I'm out of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3388
02:32:02.610 --> 02:32:03.443
<v Speaker 3>the confusion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he doesn't have to worry about me </v>

3389
02:32:05.161 --> 02:32:06.690
<v Speaker 3>shooting him in the head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh totally.</v>

3390
02:32:06.700 --> 02:32:08.370
<v Speaker 3>And shake his hand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

3391
02:32:08.371 --> 02:32:09.360
<v Speaker 3>what's up brother?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How you doing?</v>

3392
02:32:09.580 --> 02:32:10.650
<v Speaker 3>Every.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they were all good.</v>

3393
02:32:10.651 --> 02:32:14.550
<v Speaker 3>So I'm almost looking at it like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>privileged outsider,</v>

3394
02:32:14.820 --> 02:32:17.430
<v Speaker 3>but even when I was young,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>

3395
02:32:17.431 --> 02:32:20.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my actual biological dad was a cop.</v>

3396
02:32:20.910 --> 02:32:22.110
<v Speaker 3>I don't know him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never knew him,</v>

3397
02:32:23.110 --> 02:32:26.700
<v Speaker 3>knew him until I was like six got great </v>
<v Speaker 3>genes and umbro but that.</v>

3398
02:32:28.020 --> 02:32:28.853
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was a kid I remember thinking </v>

3399
02:32:31.051 --> 02:32:31.884
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what a crazy job like he has to go out </v>

3400
02:32:32.641 --> 02:32:35.370
<v Speaker 3>and that is fear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fear,</v>

3401
02:32:35.371 --> 02:32:36.204
<v Speaker 3>fear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also probably one of the reasons </v>

3402
02:32:37.531 --> 02:32:39.990
<v Speaker 3>why that led him to be so fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

3403
02:32:39.991 --> 02:32:42.330
<v Speaker 3>And I never really like let him off the </v>
<v Speaker 3>hook for that.</v>

3404
02:32:42.331 --> 02:32:43.164
<v Speaker 3>But I saw a lot of dark shit from my </v>
<v Speaker 3>actual biological dad when I was a </v>

3405
02:32:46.051 --> 02:32:47.760
<v Speaker 3>little kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like violent stuff.</v>

3406
02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:48.541
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3407
02:32:48.541 --> 02:32:53.541
<v Speaker 3>of course he's lit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a cop in New Jersey in 1967.</v>

3408
02:32:55.020 --> 02:32:57.480
<v Speaker 3>Like how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you not be fucking violent?</v>

3409
02:32:57.510 --> 02:32:58.170
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>totally,</v>

3410
02:32:58.170 --> 02:32:59.940
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to survive.</v>

3411
02:32:59.941 --> 02:33:01.280
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're on the front line.</v>

3412
02:33:01.380 --> 02:33:04.560
<v Speaker 3>And then going from that to a martial </v>
<v Speaker 3>arts,</v>

3413
02:33:04.740 --> 02:33:05.573
<v Speaker 3>from the time I was 15 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was completely immersed in martial </v>

3414
02:33:08.911 --> 02:33:12.540
<v Speaker 3>arts and I ran into a ton of cops and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were all like regular guys.</v>

3415
02:33:12.700 --> 02:33:14.490
<v Speaker 3>And it made me think like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3416
02:33:14.610 --> 02:33:15.870
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I think of a cop,</v>

3417
02:33:15.871 --> 02:33:18.480
<v Speaker 3>I don't think of someone that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>running into the trying to lock me up.</v>

3418
02:33:18.630 --> 02:33:19.463
<v Speaker 3>I think at some poor guy who has this </v>
<v Speaker 3>position in life where he's the guy who </v>

3419
02:33:23.191 --> 02:33:24.024
<v Speaker 3>has to put the badge on and hold the gun</v>
<v Speaker 3>and wear the stupid hat and stand in </v>

3420
02:33:27.331 --> 02:33:29.070
<v Speaker 3>front of the criminal and go put your </v>
<v Speaker 3>hands up.</v>

3421
02:33:29.580 --> 02:33:33.060
<v Speaker 3>I hope he doesn't get shot by a guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>behind him that he doesn't know exists.</v>

3422
02:33:33.300 --> 02:33:34.133
<v Speaker 3>And this is his life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Twenty four slash seven all day long </v>

3423
02:33:36.601 --> 02:33:37.434
<v Speaker 3>comes home to his kids their sleep and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he kisses him on the head and he thinks </v>

3424
02:33:39.721 --> 02:33:43.400
<v Speaker 3>about the kid that he saw shot in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>apartment building in the bronx to it is</v>

3425
02:33:43.410 --> 02:33:44.243
<v Speaker 3>to think about that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like I'm boy with a lot of cops </v>

3426
02:33:46.111 --> 02:33:46.944
<v Speaker 3>where I live and a lot of them are </v>
<v Speaker 3>troopers who were really well trained </v>

3427
02:33:49.111 --> 02:33:51.810
<v Speaker 3>and they're like the coolest dudes ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they just,</v>

3428
02:33:52.050 --> 02:33:52.883
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like the cops emotion is </v>
<v Speaker 3>just like where it's like you just </v>

3429
02:33:57.211 --> 02:33:59.100
<v Speaker 3>microwave your fucking baby dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3430
02:33:59.150 --> 02:33:59.983
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where it's like they see this shit and </v>

3431
02:34:01.651 --> 02:34:02.484
<v Speaker 3>then like I do a benefits for like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>tour de force and shit for like fallen </v>

3432
02:34:05.311 --> 02:34:08.820
<v Speaker 3>officers and because I have so much </v>
<v Speaker 3>compassion for that shit,</v>

3433
02:34:08.821 --> 02:34:09.654
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like they are the watchdogs of our </v>

3434
02:34:11.940 --> 02:34:15.330
<v Speaker 3>area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then you get the bad seed or you get</v>

3435
02:34:15.331 --> 02:34:18.010
<v Speaker 3>someone who makes her horrific mistake </v>
<v Speaker 3>and justice isn't</v>

3436
02:34:18.550 --> 02:34:21.490
<v Speaker 5>given and that's why it's complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

3437
02:34:21.491 --> 02:34:24.250
<v Speaker 5>sometimes it's about like lawsuits where</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>

3438
02:34:24.251 --> 02:34:25.084
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>someone fucks up and no one wants to </v>

3439
02:34:26.591 --> 02:34:27.424
<v Speaker 5>admit they're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then the community that witnessed </v>

3440
02:34:29.561 --> 02:34:31.520
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like they want their,</v>

3441
02:34:31.530 --> 02:34:33.640
<v Speaker 5>like they would just want justice,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but let's also,</v>

3442
02:34:33.641 --> 02:34:35.830
<v Speaker 5>the punishment of fucking up is so </v>
<v Speaker 5>extreme.</v>

3443
02:34:36.010 --> 02:34:36.843
<v Speaker 5>Oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Imagine if we bomb and we fucking </v>

3445
02:34:39.851 --> 02:34:43.300

<v Speaker 5>someone fucking kid dies.</v>

3446
02:34:43.480 --> 02:34:44.860
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's why dude,</v>

3447
02:34:45.070 --> 02:34:48.400
<v Speaker 5>cops deserve a lot of respect to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like it's a crazy job.</v>

3448
02:34:48.430 --> 02:34:49.263
<v Speaker 5>It's a crazy job and you're dealing with</v>
<v Speaker 5>pressure that most of us could never </v>

3449
02:34:52.061 --> 02:34:52.894
<v Speaker 5>possibly imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the life and death decisions that </v>

3450
02:34:55.420 --> 02:34:56.253
<v Speaker 5>happen at the blink of an eye and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>are responsible for those decisions for </v>

3451
02:34:59.651 --> 02:35:00.484
<v Speaker 5>the rest of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And this is something that I talk about </v>

02:37:44.661 --> 02:37:45.950
<v Speaker 6>body weight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think,</v>

3521
02:37:45.960 --> 02:37:48.380
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when I talked about movement before,</v>

3522
02:37:49.010 --> 02:37:49.843
<v Speaker 6>it's one of the things that I got from </v>
<v Speaker 6>this whole month of doing yoga and I </v>

3523
02:37:53.241 --> 02:37:57.170
<v Speaker 6>knew I've been doing yoga pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

3524
02:37:57.980 --> 02:38:00.350
<v Speaker 6>pretty extensively or this guy's a </v>
<v Speaker 6>switching back and forth.</v>

3525
02:38:00.351 --> 02:38:01.310
<v Speaker 6>That's a good move.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That tough.</v>

3526
02:38:01.311 --> 02:38:02.510
<v Speaker 6>I to ask you about that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3527
02:38:02.511 --> 02:38:03.920
<v Speaker 6>it's hard to do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3528
02:38:03.980 --> 02:38:04.400
<v Speaker 6>it's hard.</v>

3529
02:38:04.400 --> 02:38:07.370
<v Speaker 6>It's hard to release.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's because you're essentially throwing</v>

3530
02:38:07.371 --> 02:38:09.860
<v Speaker 6>yourself up and then exploding to catch </v>
<v Speaker 6>yourself.</v>

3531
02:38:10.100 --> 02:38:11.790
<v Speaker 6>I wonder if he whacks off like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He says,</v>

3532
02:38:11.900 --> 02:38:14.540
<v Speaker 6>why not?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why wouldn't you just keep switching?</v>

3533
02:38:14.570 --> 02:38:16.370
<v Speaker 6>What I learned from the yoga thing </v>
<v Speaker 6>though,</v>

3534
02:38:16.810 --> 02:38:18.560
<v Speaker 6>and I've learned over the last few </v>
<v Speaker 6>years,</v>

3535
02:38:18.570 --> 02:38:21.020
<v Speaker 6>is like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a balance issue.</v>

3536
02:38:21.050 --> 02:38:23.090
<v Speaker 6>Like what yoga does is balance </v>
<v Speaker 6>everything out,</v>

3537
02:38:23.330 --> 02:38:26.420
<v Speaker 6>not just balanced in terms of your </v>
<v Speaker 6>ability to stand on one foot,</v>

3538
02:38:26.960 --> 02:38:30.890
<v Speaker 6>but also balance the difference between </v>
<v Speaker 6>the strength of your major muscle groups</v>

3539
02:38:30.920 --> 02:38:35.920
<v Speaker 6>and then your tendons and your back and </v>
<v Speaker 6>your core and the connecting things like</v>

3540
02:38:36.021 --> 02:38:36.854
<v Speaker 6>your knees and your hips and all these </v>
<v Speaker 6>things that you never taken into </v>

3541
02:38:40.711 --> 02:38:41.544
<v Speaker 6>consideration.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like you don't really put a lot of </v>

3542
02:38:43.040 --> 02:38:46.370
<v Speaker 6>emphasis on when you do other things.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But when you do yoga,</v>

3543
02:38:46.640 --> 02:38:47.271
<v Speaker 6>you realize,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

3544
02:38:47.271 --> 02:38:49.250
<v Speaker 6>my feet are giving out first,</v>
<v Speaker 6>huh?</v>

3545
02:38:49.460 --> 02:38:51.470
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like my hips are getting sore when I get</v>

3546
02:38:51.471 --> 02:38:52.550
<v Speaker 6>into triangle pose,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

3547
02:38:52.580 --> 02:38:53.570
<v Speaker 6>oh my,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3548
02:38:53.660 --> 02:38:58.190
<v Speaker 6>and all that different stuff that you do</v>
<v Speaker 6>that I'm like,</v>

3549
02:38:58.191 --> 02:39:02.680
<v Speaker 6>it leads to like the strength and the </v>
<v Speaker 6>strengthening of uh,</v>

3550
02:39:02.960 --> 02:39:05.330
<v Speaker 6>ignored aspects of the entire system</v>

3551
02:39:05.660 --> 02:39:06.493
<v Speaker 5>and it also keeps you off your phone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I've been doing hot yoga with my </v>

3552
02:39:08.551 --> 02:39:13.551
<v Speaker 5>wife and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's so hard and she's so good at it and</v>

3553
02:39:13.740 --> 02:39:14.573
<v Speaker 5>like it's so funny because she'll do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we'll do hot yoga together like once a </v>

3554
02:39:17.101 --> 02:39:17.934
<v Speaker 5>week,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe twice a week and she'll get real </v>

3555
02:39:19.321 --> 02:39:22.490
<v Speaker 5>horny and I'm getting real dehydrated.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's like that.</v>

3556
02:39:22.650 --> 02:39:23.483
<v Speaker 5>It's the most frustrating combination </v>
<v Speaker 5>because it's like she gets really in </v>

3557
02:39:26.641 --> 02:39:29.460
<v Speaker 5>touch with her body and she's so fucking</v>
<v Speaker 5>hot and it's like awesome.</v>

3558
02:39:29.461 --> 02:39:30.271
<v Speaker 5>But then I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

3559
02:39:30.271 --> 02:39:32.250
<v Speaker 5>I need about a gallon of water to make </v>
<v Speaker 5>my cock.</v>

3560
02:39:32.251 --> 02:39:33.084
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>awesome.</v>

3561
02:39:33.510 --> 02:39:36.420
<v Speaker 5>Well just drink that gallon of water.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I work on it.</v>

3562
02:39:36.480 --> 02:39:39.240
<v Speaker 5>But I usually,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I usually under bring water into the hot</v>

3563
02:39:39.250 --> 02:39:39.430
<v Speaker 5>air.</v>

3564
02:39:39.430 --> 02:39:43.170
<v Speaker 6>The key to the the yoga is you got to </v>
<v Speaker 6>drink the water beforehand.</v>

3565
02:39:43.530 --> 02:39:45.900
<v Speaker 6>I'm usually hung over from the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>pbrs.</v>

3566
02:39:46.020 --> 02:39:47.430
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you gotta drink,</v>

3567
02:39:47.700 --> 02:39:49.400
<v Speaker 6>especially the hot yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You gotta drink.</v>

3568
02:39:49.920 --> 02:39:52.770
<v Speaker 6>Try to drink like a leader,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a leader of water,</v>

3569
02:39:52.920 --> 02:39:57.870
<v Speaker 6>like maybe an hour before and even more.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I tried to drink.</v>

3570
02:39:57.900 --> 02:40:01.510
<v Speaker 6>What is 64 ounces.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How much does that have happened ago?</v>

3571
02:40:01.720 --> 02:40:03.660
<v Speaker 6>Ounces to leaders.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's all confusing.</v>

3572
02:40:03.930 --> 02:40:04.763
<v Speaker 6>God,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wish we would switch over to the </v>

3573
02:40:05.131 --> 02:40:05.964
<v Speaker 6>metric system.</v>

3574
02:40:06.200 --> 02:40:10.070
<v Speaker 5>It's way better than english fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>king.</v>

3575
02:40:10.071 --> 02:40:12.700
<v Speaker 5>That just screwed it for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3576
02:40:12.730 --> 02:40:13.563
<v Speaker 5>I did it</v>

3577
02:40:14.400 --> 02:40:15.233
<v Speaker 2>with his foot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we tried it again in the United </v>

3578
02:40:18.330 --> 02:40:21.810
<v Speaker 2>States and I want to say the seventies </v>
<v Speaker 2>or the eighties?</v>

3579
02:40:21.930 --> 02:40:24.310
<v Speaker 2>Two point seven liters per day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hold on.</v>

3580
02:40:24.330 --> 02:40:26.880
<v Speaker 2>Ninety one out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sixty four ounces of water per day.</v>

3581
02:40:28.020 --> 02:40:30.510
<v Speaker 2>Recommended we consume 91 ounces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

3582
02:40:30.511 --> 02:40:31.344
<v Speaker 2>so two point seven liters is 91 ounces,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so 64 liters is probably somewhere in </v>

3583
02:40:34.831 --> 02:40:37.380
<v Speaker 2>the neighborhood of two leaders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

3584
02:40:37.410 --> 02:40:38.550
<v Speaker 2>One point eight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One point eight,</v>

3585
02:40:38.551 --> 02:40:40.860
<v Speaker 2>nine liters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's.</v>

3586
02:40:41.060 --> 02:40:43.980
<v Speaker 2>That's what I bring to yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bring a 64 ounce thing.</v>

3587
02:40:44.190 --> 02:40:48.090
<v Speaker 2>I think you can get that in the before </v>
<v Speaker 2>class,</v>

3588
02:40:48.091 --> 02:40:51.510
<v Speaker 2>like if you could get up early and drink</v>
<v Speaker 2>water with lemon in it,</v>

3589
02:40:51.780 --> 02:40:54.570
<v Speaker 2>you'll have a better performance because</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's literally like,</v>

3590
02:40:54.640 --> 02:40:55.473
<v Speaker 2>like an.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see it a lot from guys that get </v>

3591
02:40:56.881 --> 02:40:59.090
<v Speaker 2>dehydrated and try to make weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

3592
02:40:59.180 --> 02:41:00.013
<v Speaker 2>you're literally dealing with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>electrical signals that go to your </v>

3593
02:41:03.481 --> 02:41:06.510
<v Speaker 2>muscles are not going to fire and brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>and brain.</v>

3594
02:41:06.510 --> 02:41:09.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I got a camel pack and I crush it.</v>

3595
02:41:09.010 --> 02:41:09.843
<v Speaker 2>Why mowing my lawn?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you like a water bladder and with a </v>

3596
02:41:13.561 --> 02:41:14.700
<v Speaker 2>straw?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3597
02:41:14.790 --> 02:41:15.720
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3598
02:41:15.721 --> 02:41:17.090
<v Speaker 2>because they usually when I cross </v>
<v Speaker 2>country skiing,</v>

3599
02:41:17.091 --> 02:41:19.110
<v Speaker 2>because if I pull my hand out of my </v>
<v Speaker 2>glove,</v>

3600
02:41:19.260 --> 02:41:21.760
<v Speaker 2>my hand freezes that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are great for hiking too.</v>

3601
02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:23.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And hot.</v>

3602
02:41:23.920 --> 02:41:27.300
<v Speaker 2>If you're at a hot or cold weather at </v>
<v Speaker 2>high climates,</v>

3603
02:41:27.301 --> 02:41:30.210
<v Speaker 2>at high altitudes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll get dehydrated shit.</v>

3604
02:41:30.220 --> 02:41:31.053
<v Speaker 2>Like an aspen at the aspen comedy </v>
<v Speaker 2>festival back in the day that day I'd </v>

3605
02:41:34.450 --> 02:41:37.440
<v Speaker 2>have like three beers and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm king of the world.</v>

3606
02:41:37.470 --> 02:41:41.040
<v Speaker 2>I did a show with lewis black and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>had oxygen backstage for us.</v>

3607
02:41:41.560 --> 02:41:42.330
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

3608
02:41:42.330 --> 02:41:44.510
<v Speaker 2>louis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is the oxygen for?</v>

3609
02:41:44.650 --> 02:41:45.483
<v Speaker 2>I guess if one of us goes to horror,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they slapped that fucking mask on your </v>

3610
02:41:48.631 --> 02:41:49.680
<v Speaker 2>face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

3611
02:41:49.681 --> 02:41:51.840
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy to training up there.</v>

3612
02:41:51.840 --> 02:41:54.270
<v Speaker 2>That's like where the olympics train and</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit sometimes.</v>

3613
02:41:54.420 --> 02:41:57.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's like a fucking dime for it.</v>

3614
02:41:58.080 --> 02:42:00.340
<v Speaker 2>Anytime you can get it high altitude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just they,</v>

3615
02:42:00.370 --> 02:42:05.220
<v Speaker 2>they say you should actually work out at</v>
<v Speaker 2>low altitude but lived most of your life</v>

3616
02:42:05.280 --> 02:42:07.320
<v Speaker 2>at high altitude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm at like 3000.</v>

3617
02:42:07.620 --> 02:42:08.950
<v Speaker 2>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thousands.</v>

3618
02:42:09.180 --> 02:42:11.250
<v Speaker 2>Definitely better than zero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

3619
02:42:11.251 --> 02:42:14.070
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you can get accustomed to that,</v>

3620
02:42:14.100 --> 02:42:14.933
<v Speaker 2>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talked to a dude once when I lived in </v>

3621
02:42:16.171 --> 02:42:17.004
<v Speaker 2>boulder and he told me that it takes </v>
<v Speaker 2>three years for you to fully acclimate </v>

3622
02:42:20.280 --> 02:42:21.113
<v Speaker 2>to a high altitude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that once you do fully acclimate </v>

3623
02:42:23.731 --> 02:42:26.430
<v Speaker 2>those like extreme,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like cardiovascular benefits,</v>

3624
02:42:26.460 --> 02:42:28.650
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you get a sweet boner.</v>

3625
02:42:29.310 --> 02:42:31.980
<v Speaker 2>Maybe not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe that's the trade off.</v>

3626
02:42:32.070 --> 02:42:34.610
<v Speaker 2>You're going to run forever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but your dick is always recorded mast.</v>

3627
02:42:35.490 --> 02:42:39.920
<v Speaker 2>That's what I miss about la is the beach</v>
<v Speaker 2>runs and then the people like dudes like</v>

3628
02:42:39.930 --> 02:42:40.763
<v Speaker 2>you and like just really brilliantly </v>
<v Speaker 2>creative people and also the beach runs </v>

3629
02:42:44.911 --> 02:42:45.160
<v Speaker 2>and shit.</v>

3630
02:42:45.160 --> 02:42:48.120
<v Speaker 2>It's the physical beauty ir.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't miss that entertainment industry</v>

3631
02:42:48.121 --> 02:42:50.520
<v Speaker 2>and the traffic was a different kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>beauty.</v>

3632
02:42:50.521 --> 02:42:51.660
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you're in the mountains.</v>

3633
02:42:51.830 --> 02:42:53.370
<v Speaker 2>It's so gorgeous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I missed those.</v>

3634
02:42:53.371 --> 02:42:58.371

3639
02:43:10.621 --> 02:43:11.454
<v Speaker 2>is really beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the amount of biomes like </v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3654
02:43:39.190 --> 02:43:40.023
<v Speaker 2>It's easy to get like real accustomed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you see right in front of your </v>

3655
02:43:43.031 --> 02:43:44.230
<v Speaker 2>face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3656
02:43:44.231 --> 02:43:47.260
<v Speaker 2>And like I have so many memories now </v>
<v Speaker 2>with my family there and my chicken just</v>

3657
02:43:47.261 --> 02:43:48.094
<v Speaker 2>giving me food everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just keep shooting out eggs and </v>

3658
02:43:50.860 --> 02:43:52.150
<v Speaker 2>wolves up there either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3659
02:43:52.180 --> 02:43:54.300
<v Speaker 2>We got coyotes and I've learned a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>about guide.</v>

3660
02:43:54.301 --> 02:43:56.740
<v Speaker 2>Who's from your podcast?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dan flores.</v>

3661
02:43:56.800 --> 02:43:57.541
<v Speaker 2>Do you kill them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

3662
02:43:57.541 --> 02:43:59.250
<v Speaker 2>they multiple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>either like gremlins.</v>

3663
02:43:59.290 --> 02:44:02.410
<v Speaker 2>You can't kill coyotes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So actually the worst thing you can do.</v>

3664
02:44:02.690 --> 02:44:05.500
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the things spread their range to me.</v>

3665
02:44:05.670 --> 02:44:06.503
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a type of cat phisher fisher's </v>

3666
02:44:08.260 --> 02:44:11.600
<v Speaker 2>fisher cats to keep jacking my shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

3667
02:44:11.650 --> 02:44:13.600
<v Speaker 2>foxes and raccoons are my enemies.</v>

3668
02:44:13.600 --> 02:44:17.170
<v Speaker 2>Coyote is not so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Coyotes will get a chicken if they can,</v>

3669
02:44:17.171 --> 02:44:20.500
<v Speaker 2>but coyotes are smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are oddly clever,</v>

3670
02:44:20.770 --> 02:44:22.720
<v Speaker 2>like they figured out how to avoid </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

3671
02:44:22.950 --> 02:44:23.783
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that I found most </v>

3672
02:44:24.791 --> 02:44:25.624
<v Speaker 2>fascinating about dan flores book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>iod America was the mythology that the </v>

3673
02:44:31.091 --> 02:44:31.924
<v Speaker 2>native americans had about coyotes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the coyote who was essentially a </v>

3674
02:44:35.321 --> 02:44:38.800
<v Speaker 2>god and the kid was a god that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>watching over you,</v>

3675
02:44:38.830 --> 02:44:42.190
<v Speaker 2>like watching what you did all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly judging you and try.</v>

3676
02:44:43.250 --> 02:44:44.083
<v Speaker 2>It was really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the native american and some </v>

3677
02:44:47.330 --> 02:44:48.163
<v Speaker 2>tribes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their interpretation of what a coyote </v>

3678
02:44:49.290 --> 02:44:50.560
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was really fast.</v>

3679
02:44:50.561 --> 02:44:51.394
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're pretty powerful if like if they </v>

3680
02:44:52.631 --> 02:44:53.464
<v Speaker 2>jack your chickens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like sometimes like we were talking </v>

3681
02:44:54.761 --> 02:44:55.594
<v Speaker 2>about empathy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what's it like to live a different </v>

3682
02:44:56.561 --> 02:44:57.490
<v Speaker 2>life?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3683
02:44:57.491 --> 02:44:58.324
<v Speaker 2>what if I needed these chickens?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I got more chickens but we had one </v>

3684
02:45:00.851 --> 02:45:04.150
<v Speaker 2>chicken holocaust and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're fucked now.</v>

3685
02:45:04.390 --> 02:45:07.240
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if that was like the winter and </v>
<v Speaker 2>like the chickens are gone.</v>

3686
02:45:07.300 --> 02:45:09.220
<v Speaker 2>It's like what do we eat?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But here's the thing,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I had a weird come to jesus moment when </v>

3689
02:45:14.591 --> 02:45:15.424
<v Speaker 2>it came to coyotes when a coyote stole </v>
<v Speaker 2>one of my chickens and I watched her </v>

3690
02:45:17.291 --> 02:45:21.510
<v Speaker 2>talking about a tricky trick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My dog called is a honeybee.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Johnny Cash tore through the chicken </v>
<v Speaker 2>wire with his paws and got in and it was</v>

3696
02:45:41.111 --> 02:45:43.400
<v Speaker 2>a chicken holocaust in there.</v>

<v Speaker 2>but I'm on the road a lot and that's </v>

3718
02:46:36.531 --> 02:46:38.420
<v Speaker 2>what I know she misses me when she's </v>

<v Speaker 2>raccoon.</v>

3721
02:46:42.020 --> 02:46:47.020
<v Speaker 2>It's always just a fucking animal spot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Might have to go.</v>

3722
02:46:47.360 --> 02:46:48.193
<v Speaker 2>David might ask to go yet because my </v>
<v Speaker 2>brother's getting into hunting now and </v>

3723
02:46:50.151 --> 02:46:54.040
<v Speaker 2>like I think he wants to kill spot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have taught you,</v>

3724
02:46:54.100 --> 02:46:54.933
<v Speaker 2>you talked about it before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the podcast that you thought about </v>

3725
02:46:56.330 --> 02:46:58.670
<v Speaker 2>actually getting into hunting yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't want to wound down.</v>

3726
02:46:59.330 --> 02:47:02.680
<v Speaker 2>It has to be a quick kill because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>would love to hunt and,</v>

3727
02:47:02.700 --> 02:47:03.533
<v Speaker 2>and my wife wants me to hide because uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because my uncle hunts a lot and </v>

3728
02:47:06.561 --> 02:47:07.394
<v Speaker 2>whenever we stay with him he's always </v>
<v Speaker 2>got like pheasant and shit and like it </v>

<v Speaker 2>animals.</v>

3730
02:47:12.051 --> 02:47:15.440

<v Speaker 2>It's like there's something different.</v>

3731
02:47:15.441 --> 02:47:16.274
<v Speaker 2>There's something going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does anybody around you hunt and is </v>

3732
02:47:20.301 --> 02:47:21.134
<v Speaker 2>willing to take you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And literally everybody didn't want to </v>

3733
02:47:23.511 --> 02:47:24.020
<v Speaker 2>mentor you.</v>

3734
02:47:24.020 --> 02:47:26.270
<v Speaker 2>Fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All you have to do is learn how to shoot</v>

3735
02:47:26.271 --> 02:47:27.480
<v Speaker 2>a rifle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3736
02:47:27.560 --> 02:47:28.393
<v Speaker 2>And here's the mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot you could read about </v>

3737
02:47:31.251 --> 02:47:32.910
<v Speaker 2>shooting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3738
02:47:33.080 --> 02:47:33.913
<v Speaker 2>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to get someone who sets up the </v>

3739
02:47:34.971 --> 02:47:37.700
<v Speaker 2>scope correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sets up the rifle correctly,</v>

3740
02:47:37.910 --> 02:47:38.743
<v Speaker 2>and then you just have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone have someone teach you the </v>

3741
02:47:40.431 --> 02:47:44.840
<v Speaker 2>proper form and how to just only move </v>
<v Speaker 2>your finger.</v>

3742
02:47:44.841 --> 02:47:45.651
<v Speaker 2>Just pull,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pull,</v>

3744
02:47:46.221 --> 02:47:47.840

<v Speaker 2>pull and get a surprise shot.</v>

3745
02:47:48.120 --> 02:47:51.350
<v Speaker 2>You can't go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You try to shoot because you'll flinch.</v>

3746
02:47:51.351 --> 02:47:52.184
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a minor movement left or right over 100 </v>

3747
02:47:55.731 --> 02:47:56.564
<v Speaker 2>yards could equal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can be the difference between a </v>

3748
02:47:58.461 --> 02:47:59.294
<v Speaker 2>lethal shot and shooting an animal in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the butt and anybody who's shot a rifle </v>

3749
02:48:03.201 --> 02:48:05.510
<v Speaker 2>including me has done that before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not good.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3762
02:48:37.041 --> 02:48:41.440
<v Speaker 2>like syracuse or some shit and then take</v>
<v Speaker 2>a puddle jumper that killed somebody.</v>

3763
02:48:41.540 --> 02:48:42.840
<v Speaker 2>Some lethal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some weeds.</v>

3764
02:48:42.980 --> 02:48:45.740
<v Speaker 2>Flights like body holidays.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's enough,</v>

<v Speaker 2>there's enough like super wealthy people</v>
<v Speaker 2>there that we have like a pretty legit </v>

3766
02:48:49.791 --> 02:48:51.680
<v Speaker 2>airport and this little area because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a.</v>

3767
02:48:51.700 --> 02:48:54.110
<v Speaker 2>But they fly their own jets in those </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuckers.</v>

3768
02:48:54.310 --> 02:48:55.143
<v Speaker 2>They do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they fly their private jets into your </v>

3769
02:48:56.361 --> 02:49:00.050
<v Speaker 2>little funky town and then they just sit</v>
<v Speaker 2>there and then we are always like,</v>

3770
02:49:00.051 --> 02:49:01.380
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you pay us to hunt for you.</v>

<v Speaker 2>dude wants to hunt because it's like,</v>

3773
02:49:07.380 --> 02:49:09.360
<v Speaker 2>how many animals do you have up there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What kind of animals?</v>

3774
02:49:09.610 --> 02:49:11.340
<v Speaker 2>We have moose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deer.</v>

3775
02:49:11.840 --> 02:49:14.850
<v Speaker 2>It's probably hard to get a moose tag </v>
<v Speaker 2>though right now.</v>

3776
02:49:14.851 --> 02:49:18.060
<v Speaker 2>It's not that hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to miss.</v>

3777
02:49:18.600 --> 02:49:20.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're talking about shooting a house.</v>

3778
02:49:20.310 --> 02:49:22.020
<v Speaker 2>They're like an ancient logan animal </v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3779
02:49:22.021 --> 02:49:24.510
<v Speaker 2>It's so crazy looking and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking vicious.</v>

3780
02:49:24.660 --> 02:49:25.493
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well they do.</v>

3781
02:49:25.530 --> 02:49:26.363
<v Speaker 2>They are rare in the deer family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like all deer will fuck you up if they </v>

3782
02:49:30.451 --> 02:49:32.040
<v Speaker 2>have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially when they're in rut.</v>

3783
02:49:32.041 --> 02:49:33.060
<v Speaker 2>They're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3784
02:49:33.090 --> 02:49:33.923
<v Speaker 2>but a moose will try to fuck you up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a difference because they're </v>

3785
02:49:36.541 --> 02:49:37.374
<v Speaker 2>constantly dealing with grizzly bears </v>
<v Speaker 2>and brown bears and they can fuck you </v>

3786
02:49:40.021 --> 02:49:40.790
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can.</v>

3787
02:49:40.790 --> 02:49:44.140
<v Speaker 2>Their big dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw him once up there and it was like.</v>

3788
02:49:44.670 --> 02:49:46.440
<v Speaker 2>It was like a come to jesus moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3789
02:49:46.470 --> 02:49:47.250
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

3790
02:49:47.250 --> 02:49:49.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm a guest in this area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

3791
02:49:49.501 --> 02:49:52.600
<v Speaker 2>I shot one that was young.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

3792
02:49:52.950 --> 02:49:53.783
<v Speaker 2>he had like a little fork on the left </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the fork in the right and each one </v>

3793
02:49:56.161 --> 02:49:56.994
<v Speaker 2>of his legs was over 100 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a scoop his leg up and throw it </v>

3794
02:49:59.641 --> 02:50:01.830
<v Speaker 2>over my shoulder bigger than alwan.</v>

3795
02:50:03.840 --> 02:50:07.650
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like a stone in england </v>
<v Speaker 2>where it's like how many ali wongs way.</v>

3796
02:50:10.320 --> 02:50:11.153
<v Speaker 2>There's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did a cover for peterson's hunting </v>

3797
02:50:13.321 --> 02:50:14.154
<v Speaker 2>magazine and on the cover I'm holding a </v>
<v Speaker 2>moose leg over my shoulder and it's a </v>

3798
02:50:18.121 --> 02:50:18.954
<v Speaker 2>crazy picture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you look at how big that fucking </v>

3799
02:50:20.251 --> 02:50:21.084
<v Speaker 2>leg is and that's not a big moose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The moose that I shot was only like </v>

3800
02:50:24.720 --> 02:50:28.140
<v Speaker 2>maybe 900 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was fairly small for a moose,</v>

3801
02:50:28.200 --> 02:50:31.470
<v Speaker 2>but that's like the entire offensive </v>
<v Speaker 2>line of the dallas cowboys.</v>

3802
02:50:31.890 --> 02:50:33.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right there.</v>

3803
02:50:33.420 --> 02:50:37.050
<v Speaker 2>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That moose would've fucked me up.</v>

3804
02:50:37.700 --> 02:50:40.710
<v Speaker 2>Like there's not a way in hell you could</v>
<v Speaker 2>have stopped.</v>

3805
02:50:40.711 --> 02:50:42.660
<v Speaker 2>That moves from stomping a hole in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>chest.</v>

3806
02:50:43.350 --> 02:50:44.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they want to.</v>

3807
02:50:44.780 --> 02:50:48.480
<v Speaker 2>It's like a lot of prey animals get is </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost as vicious as the predators.</v>

3808
02:50:48.960 --> 02:50:51.570
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though I don't feel as much empathy</v>

3809
02:50:51.571 --> 02:50:54.900
<v Speaker 2>for the prior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like if I wounded a fucking cat,</v>

3810
02:50:54.930 --> 02:50:55.770
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be like,</v>

3811
02:50:55.771 --> 02:50:57.120
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you learn your lesson brow.</v>

3812
02:50:57.220 --> 02:51:00.000
<v Speaker 2>Like my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my brother recently hit A raccoon with a</v>

3813
02:51:00.030 --> 02:51:02.580
<v Speaker 2>pitchfork and lived.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

3814
02:51:02.581 --> 02:51:06.210
<v Speaker 2>I didn't feel bad at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well he lived as far as you know.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>coming in and trying to get our hands.</v>

3819
02:51:15.121 --> 02:51:16.860

<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3820
02:51:16.861 --> 02:51:18.720

<v Speaker 2>Like what he's doing,</v>

3821
02:51:18.721 --> 02:51:22.310
<v Speaker 2>he's just trying to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just found a way to eat and we starve</v>

3822
02:51:22.320 --> 02:51:26.940
<v Speaker 2>and he's in that hardscrabble life of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the wilderness and there's,</v>

3823
02:51:27.540 --> 02:51:30.420
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of food up there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's a beautiful area.</v>

3877
02:54:18.131 --> 02:54:18.964
<v Speaker 2>plague?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was reading something about the black </v>

3878
02:54:20.321 --> 02:54:24.220
<v Speaker 2>death is spreading because people like </v>

<v Speaker 2>and it was.</v>

3882
02:54:29.960 --> 02:54:30.793
<v Speaker 2>They were talking indie or some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were talking about how there's a </v>

3883
02:54:34.571 --> 02:54:38.500
<v Speaker 2>problem with a culture where people pull</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bodies out of the ground,</v>

3884
02:54:38.501 --> 02:54:39.400
<v Speaker 2>the zoom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bodies,</v>

3885
02:54:39.401 --> 02:54:40.234
<v Speaker 2>and we're dancing around them and it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>literally causing the black death </v>

3886
02:54:42.740 --> 02:54:44.470
<v Speaker 2>display.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dancing with death.</v>

3887
02:54:44.590 --> 02:54:45.423
<v Speaker 2>Madagascar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Plague is spreading because relatives </v>

3888
02:54:47.711 --> 02:54:48.544
<v Speaker 2>are digging up their black death corpses</v>
<v Speaker 2>and dancing as part of an ancient fama </v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean that's commitment to dance.</v>

3890
02:54:58.540 --> 02:55:00.670
<v Speaker 2>That's commitment to stupidity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>where if someone's like,</v>

3891
02:55:00.671 --> 02:55:01.960
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna die if you do that.</v>

3892
02:55:01.961 --> 02:55:02.321
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

<v Speaker 7>They're not honorable.</v>
<v Speaker 7>more.</v>

3900
02:55:15.141 --> 02:55:15.974
<v Speaker 7>I think like that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The fake old fake news thing from the </v>

3901
02:55:18.141 --> 02:55:20.200
<v Speaker 7>grocery store that you'd always see,</v>

<v Speaker 7>I have no idea.</v>

3905
02:55:30.800 --> 02:55:31.633
<v Speaker 7>It's almost like the opium wars where </v>
<v Speaker 7>it's like we're just flooded with </v>

3906
02:55:33.711 --> 02:55:35.810
<v Speaker 7>fucking info at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which said jeremy.</v>

3907
02:55:35.811 --> 02:55:37.140
<v Speaker 7>So that's what those hearings are about </v>
<v Speaker 7>to.</v>

3908
02:55:37.160 --> 02:55:37.993
<v Speaker 7>I was just reading.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's something tim cook gave a talk </v>

3909
02:55:39.771 --> 02:55:41.240
<v Speaker 7>this afternoon.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The apple guy?</v>

3910
02:55:41.320 --> 02:55:42.530
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>based off of the.</v>

3911
02:55:42.560 --> 02:55:43.393
<v Speaker 7>He said is that the fake news spreading </v>
<v Speaker 7>is probably the bigger problem than the </v>

3912
02:55:45.981 --> 02:55:46.700
<v Speaker 7>russian ads.</v>

3913
02:55:46.700 --> 02:55:47.533
<v Speaker 7>He says the ads is probably like a point</v>
<v Speaker 7>one percent of the actual problem and </v>

3914
02:55:51.710 --> 02:55:52.543
<v Speaker 7>the ability for fake news to spread,</v>
<v Speaker 7>manipulate people through social media </v>

3915
02:55:55.381 --> 02:55:58.370
<v Speaker 7>is problems one through 10 and you can </v>
<v Speaker 7>be fixed.</v>

3916
02:55:58.510 --> 02:56:01.400
<v Speaker 7>It's a judge that that was almost like a</v>
<v Speaker 7>martin luther catholic church thing.</v>

3917
02:56:01.401 --> 02:56:02.000
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh no,</v>

3918
02:56:02.000 --> 02:56:02.833
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no.</v>

3919
02:56:02.960 --> 02:56:04.760
<v Speaker 7>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Who gets to judge.</v>

3920
02:56:04.820 --> 02:56:05.653
<v Speaker 7>It's whether or not it's fake.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like concentrating on who the person is </v>

3921
02:56:08.930 --> 02:56:11.330
<v Speaker 7>that gets the judge.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's not helping anybody,</v>

3922
02:56:11.540 --> 02:56:13.820
<v Speaker 7>but what?</v>
<v Speaker 7>What's fake and what's not fake?</v>

3923
02:56:13.910 --> 02:56:17.450
<v Speaker 7>There's gotta be a way to differentiate.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This should be like a pregnancy test</v>

3924
02:56:17.600 --> 02:56:22.340

02:58:29.780 --> 02:58:30.950
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's uh,</v>

3975
02:58:31.020 --> 02:58:32.460
<v Speaker 2>he didn't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who said it?</v>

3976
02:58:32.790 --> 02:58:34.410
<v Speaker 2>It's a point of weinstein.</v>

3977
02:58:34.410 --> 02:58:37.260
<v Speaker 2>Pals said that his pals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

3978
02:58:37.700 --> 02:58:39.870
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Weinstein tells pals.</v>

3979
02:58:39.990 --> 02:58:40.823
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there you go.</v>

3980
02:58:41.280 --> 02:58:42.390
<v Speaker 2>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey.</v>

3981
02:58:42.420 --> 02:58:44.430
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is secondhand information.</v>

3982
02:58:44.490 --> 02:58:48.360
<v Speaker 2>He wasn'T loaded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>he tells pals is a scandal happens so he</v>

3983
02:58:48.361 --> 02:58:50.490
<v Speaker 2>could change the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I said.</v>

3984
02:58:50.640 --> 02:58:53.760
<v Speaker 2>So I'll make it larger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the hero's journey for perverts.</v>

3985
02:58:54.150 --> 02:58:54.983
<v Speaker 2>It says disgraced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Harvey weinstein has been telling what </v>

3986
02:58:57.960 --> 02:58:58.793
<v Speaker 2>friends he has left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If there's a bigger reason that he's </v>

3987
02:59:01.681 --> 02:59:02.514
<v Speaker 2>embroiled in the ever wielding a </v>
<v Speaker 2>widening sexual harassment scandal to </v>

3988
02:59:06.361 --> 02:59:09.120
<v Speaker 2>change the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sources tell page six.</v>

3989
02:59:10.020 --> 02:59:13.620
<v Speaker 2>I hate when they say sources say he's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>savior.</v>

3990
02:59:13.760 --> 02:59:15.510
<v Speaker 2>A hollywood insider says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3991
02:59:15.850 --> 02:59:18.120
<v Speaker 2>this is all bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every swing,</v>

3992
02:59:18.390 --> 02:59:20.580
<v Speaker 2>but it's an interesting angle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's keep going.</v>

3993
02:59:21.120 --> 02:59:23.670
<v Speaker 2>A source adds that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The pervy wow.</v>

3994
02:59:23.671 --> 02:59:25.890
<v Speaker 2>That's rude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Former weinstein.</v>

3995
02:59:27.920 --> 02:59:30.540
<v Speaker 2>Miramax,</v>

3997
02:59:31.970 --> 02:59:34.870
<v Speaker 2>Some might have left out a word or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>letter word?</v>

3998
02:59:35.300 --> 02:59:36.510
<v Speaker 2>Miramax.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Marcher.</v>

3999
02:59:36.570 --> 02:59:37.530
<v Speaker 2>Mocker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

4002
02:59:41.440 --> 02:59:46.440
<v Speaker 2>You never heard it used acidic word big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know there's like big maka,</v>

4003
02:59:51.000 --> 02:59:53.550
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think it's my her person who</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets things done.</v>

4004
02:59:53.600 --> 02:59:55.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is big monster.</v>

4005
02:59:55.940 --> 02:59:57.450
<v Speaker 2>Nice yiddish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There we go.</v>

4006
02:59:57.890 --> 02:59:58.723
<v Speaker 2>Has been telling a confidence that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>was born to take the fall for his </v>

4007
03:00:02.821 --> 03:00:03.654
<v Speaker 2>behavior in order to change the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is resigned to his punishment as a </v>

4008
03:00:07.681 --> 03:00:10.140
<v Speaker 2>martyr for social change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But here's the thing,</v>

4009
03:00:10.340 --> 03:00:13.740
<v Speaker 2>a comment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A rep for weinstein commented.</v>

4010
03:00:13.950 --> 03:00:16.050
<v Speaker 2>That's absurd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is absurd.</v>

4011
03:00:16.200 --> 03:00:17.970
<v Speaker 2>But.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But here's the thing.</v>

4012
03:00:19.020 --> 03:00:19.853
<v Speaker 2>I think that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that there's like some </v>

4013
03:00:21.961 --> 03:00:22.794
<v Speaker 2>crazy fucking destiny that he has the </v>
<v Speaker 2>golden ring and he was supposed to take </v>

4014
03:00:26.791 --> 03:00:30.090
<v Speaker 2>the fall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but through his own folly,</v>

4015
03:00:30.420 --> 03:00:31.253
<v Speaker 2>through his own greedy fat chubby dick </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to pump his ineffective lowe's </v>

4016
03:00:37.321 --> 03:00:40.350
<v Speaker 2>into the mouths of tens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he really is going to change the world.</v>

4017
03:00:40.380 --> 03:00:42.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he doesn't get to say it though,</v>

4018
03:00:42.350 --> 03:00:44.760
<v Speaker 2>like the other people have to feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if he did.</v>

4019
03:00:44.761 --> 03:00:45.361
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

4020
03:00:45.361 --> 03:00:47.430
<v Speaker 2>it's one of these insiders that don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>exist.</v>

4021
03:00:47.880 --> 03:00:50.130
<v Speaker 2>They Might've been real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they might've been fake.</v>

4022
03:00:50.460 --> 03:00:53.220
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you do if you were a writer,</v>

4023
03:00:53.300 --> 03:00:54.133
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not saying this person did that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could have made that quote up and </v>

4024
03:00:56.131 --> 03:00:56.964
<v Speaker 2>just wrote an article,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but of course juicy headline that gets </v>

4025
03:00:58.561 --> 03:00:59.680
<v Speaker 2>talked about podcasts.</v>

4026
03:01:00.280 --> 03:01:03.000
<v Speaker 6>Sources could be like your horses.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean that was a.</v>

4027
03:01:03.110 --> 03:01:07.630
<v Speaker 6>I mean I hate to exonerate him,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but trump has said that many times about</v>

4028
03:01:07.631 --> 03:01:10.030
<v Speaker 6>some of the stores.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is it the stories written about him?</v>

4029
03:01:10.270 --> 03:01:12.640
<v Speaker 6>They keep saying according to sources,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's like,</v>

4030
03:01:12.641 --> 03:01:13.474
<v Speaker 6>you don't have any sources.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The sources do need to be protected for </v>

4031
03:01:15.551 --> 03:01:16.840
<v Speaker 6>journalists.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're right,</v>

4032
03:01:16.870 --> 03:01:20.470
<v Speaker 6>so is a really weird sort of gray area.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're right.</v>

4033
03:01:21.040 --> 03:01:21.830
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean there's.</v>

4034
03:01:21.830 --> 03:01:26.500
<v Speaker 6>There's only one way that someone's </v>
<v Speaker 6>going to give you information that could</v>

4035
03:01:26.501 --> 03:01:28.900
<v Speaker 6>possibly threatened their life if they </v>
<v Speaker 6>are.</v>

4036
03:01:28.950 --> 03:01:30.730
<v Speaker 6>There's no financial benefit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

4037
03:01:31.630 --> 03:01:35.830
<v Speaker 6>No societal benefit for them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They have to be anonymous.</v>

4038
03:01:36.550 --> 03:01:37.960
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We've always been.</v>

4039
03:01:38.220 --> 03:01:42.010
<v Speaker 6>That was one of the main problems that I</v>
<v Speaker 6>had with the obama administration.</v>

4040
03:01:42.310 --> 03:01:44.230
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>people sort of let them slide on that,</v>

4041
03:01:44.231 --> 03:01:47.260
<v Speaker 6>but it was one of the worst with whistle</v>
<v Speaker 6>ever.</v>

4042
03:01:48.220 --> 03:01:51.280
<v Speaker 6>There was a part of the hope and change </v>
<v Speaker 6>website,</v>

4043
03:01:51.600 --> 03:01:56.600
<v Speaker 6>a part of the hope and change website </v>
<v Speaker 6>that was later redacted or a deleted was</v>

4044
03:01:57.281 --> 03:01:58.114
<v Speaker 6>that they were talking about expanding </v>
<v Speaker 6>protection for whistleblowers who are </v>

4045
03:02:02.591 --> 03:02:03.424
<v Speaker 6>exposing someone breaking the law,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is exactly what edward snowden </v>

4046
03:02:08.831 --> 03:02:09.140
<v Speaker 6>did.</v>

4047
03:02:09.140 --> 03:02:09.640
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That,</v>

4048
03:02:09.640 --> 03:02:12.530
<v Speaker 5>like obama trick me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he tricked the trick me,</v>

4049
03:02:12.540 --> 03:02:14.630
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've already checked himself $2,</v>

4050
03:02:14.631 --> 03:02:18.920
<v Speaker 5>like this is going to unite the races of</v>
<v Speaker 5>America and he's going to be transparent</v>

4051
03:02:19.160 --> 03:02:19.993
<v Speaker 5>and he's such a good speaker.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's made me cry like literally with </v>

4052
03:02:22.941 --> 03:02:25.410
<v Speaker 5>hope and then I see what the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what he's,</v>

4053
03:02:25.490 --> 03:02:26.810
<v Speaker 5>what he does.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>

4054
03:02:26.870 --> 03:02:28.910
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4055
03:02:28.911 --> 03:02:29.744
<v Speaker 5>seventy seven cents is bullshit man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's like those little things where </v>

4056
03:02:32.241 --> 03:02:33.290
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what that is.</v>

4057
03:02:33.650 --> 03:02:34.483
<v Speaker 5>Oh the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they say the wage gap between men and </v>

4058
03:02:36.141 --> 03:02:37.730
<v Speaker 5>women is seventy seven cents on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>dollar.</v>

4059
03:02:37.731 --> 03:02:39.770
<v Speaker 5>And he said that publicly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>publicly.</v>

4060
03:02:39.771 --> 03:02:41.450
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's one thing if it's buzzfeed,</v>

4061
03:02:41.451 --> 03:02:45.430
<v Speaker 5>it's the president of United States and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that is completely bullshit.</v>

4062
03:02:45.431 --> 03:02:48.560
<v Speaker 5>It's been debunked by the female </v>
<v Speaker 5>president of harvard.</v>

4063
03:02:48.830 --> 03:02:51.230
<v Speaker 5>Like this is not reality at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like.</v>

4064
03:02:51.830 --> 03:02:54.230
<v Speaker 5>And so when I see claim what it really </v>
<v Speaker 5>is though,</v>

4065
03:02:54.320 --> 03:02:56.750
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it really is more like a four cents.</v>

4066
03:02:56.751 --> 03:02:58.900
<v Speaker 5>Maybe it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4067
03:02:59.070 --> 03:02:59.903
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't include a factors such as </v>

4068
03:03:02.211 --> 03:03:03.044
<v Speaker 5>quitting for having a children or </v>
<v Speaker 5>dangerous jobs or all this shit that's </v>

4069
03:03:06.531 --> 03:03:07.364
<v Speaker 5>just a rough average.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But if you look at this man and a woman </v>

4070
03:03:10.281 --> 03:03:13.340
<v Speaker 5>with the same job for the same amount of</v>
<v Speaker 5>years with the same education,</v>

4071
03:03:13.580 --> 03:03:15.920
<v Speaker 5>it's basically the same.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's very close</v>

4072
03:03:16.480 --> 03:03:17.313
<v Speaker 6>jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A man makes more and they have </v>

4073
03:03:19.231 --> 03:03:22.510
<v Speaker 6>attributed that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>although there's no real way to tell,</v>

4074
03:03:22.570 --> 03:03:23.150
<v Speaker 6>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4075
03:03:23.150 --> 03:03:23.983
<v Speaker 6>they believed that's attributable to man</v>
<v Speaker 6>is more aggressive in negotiating his </v>

4076
03:03:29.171 --> 03:03:32.050
<v Speaker 6>initial salary total and subsequent </v>
<v Speaker 6>raises.</v>

4077
03:03:32.160 --> 03:03:32.993
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the,</v>

4078
03:03:33.080 --> 03:03:36.780
<v Speaker 5>the interesting thing is women are </v>
<v Speaker 5>better at negotiating for other people.</v>

4079
03:03:37.020 --> 03:03:39.060
<v Speaker 5>Like I've had female female agents that </v>
<v Speaker 5>are like,</v>

4080
03:03:39.120 --> 03:03:42.180
<v Speaker 5>vicious and awesome because they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

4081
03:03:42.181 --> 03:03:44.010
<v Speaker 5>it's almost like their baby cops where </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're like,</v>

4082
03:03:44.011 --> 03:03:44.970
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they deserve more.</v>

4083
03:03:44.971 --> 03:03:47.040
<v Speaker 5>That's my baby.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But for themselves point.</v>

4084
03:03:47.220 --> 03:03:48.360
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for themselves.</v>

4085
03:03:48.361 --> 03:03:49.194
<v Speaker 5>They're not as alpha because I think </v>
<v Speaker 5>their attractiveness isn't bret </v>

4086
03:03:52.141 --> 03:03:54.660
<v Speaker 5>weinstein shit where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>their attractiveness is.</v>

4087
03:03:54.661 --> 03:03:55.494
<v Speaker 5>So given that they don't have to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like most men didn't fucking procreate </v>

4088
03:03:58.881 --> 03:04:02.090
<v Speaker 5>for most of human civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so we're always just trying to be like,</v>

4089
03:04:02.300 --> 03:04:03.770
<v Speaker 5>look dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got a car,</v>

4090
03:04:04.260 --> 03:04:07.280
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's an interesting point because like</v>

4091
03:04:08.150 --> 03:04:12.690
<v Speaker 5>if you have a view like there's two </v>
<v Speaker 5>girls and one girl is like kind of gross</v>

4092
03:04:13.010 --> 03:04:15.440
<v Speaker 5>and overweight and the other girl is </v>
<v Speaker 5>really pretty.</v>

4093
03:04:15.560 --> 03:04:20.000
<v Speaker 5>The gross overweight girl will protect </v>
<v Speaker 5>that pretty girl,</v>

4094
03:04:20.030 --> 03:04:22.520
<v Speaker 5>like a fucking german shepherd.</v>

4095
03:04:22.550 --> 03:04:23.383
<v Speaker 5>Totally shielded,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that the gross overweight girl will </v>

4096
03:04:29.541 --> 03:04:34.400
<v Speaker 5>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then tire bus load of willing men of</v>

4097
03:04:34.401 --> 03:04:35.550
<v Speaker 5>course.</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

4098
03:04:35.590 --> 03:04:38.720
<v Speaker 5>Like men are like super excited about </v>
<v Speaker 5>her.</v>

4099
03:04:38.870 --> 03:04:39.703
<v Speaker 5>All the standards get out the window.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She has a couple of shots of vodka and </v>

4100
03:04:42.381 --> 03:04:46.890
<v Speaker 5>she's like fucking taking her bra off as</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's walking through those ills.</v>

4101
03:04:46.910 --> 03:04:50.910
<v Speaker 5>Expanding school bus doors for us </v>
<v Speaker 5>though,</v>

4102
03:04:50.980 --> 03:04:53.540
<v Speaker 5>tourists,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they call desert roses where it's like,</v>

4103
03:04:54.050 --> 03:04:55.700
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a is a 10,</v>

4104
03:04:55.730 --> 03:04:57.710
<v Speaker 5>but that doesn't happen the other way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if,</v>

4105
03:04:57.730 --> 03:05:00.350
<v Speaker 5>if there's a bunch of women on a desert </v>
<v Speaker 5>island,</v>

4106
03:05:00.351 --> 03:05:03.860
<v Speaker 5>there's some fucking weinstein with no </v>
<v Speaker 5>movie credentials,</v>

4107
03:05:04.240 --> 03:05:06.830
<v Speaker 5>they don't read them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They can just be like,</v>

4108
03:05:06.831 --> 03:05:08.870
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we can just hang out with each other and</v>

4109
03:05:08.871 --> 03:05:11.480
<v Speaker 5>just kind of cuddle and fuck anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>RighT.</v>

4110
03:05:11.481 --> 03:05:14.120
<v Speaker 5>But like dudes are like as low as it </v>
<v Speaker 5>goes,</v>

4111
03:05:14.121 --> 03:05:17.450
<v Speaker 5>we will potentially meet that standard </v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's.</v>

4112
03:05:17.840 --> 03:05:20.280
<v Speaker 5>And that's why it's like men can highly </v>
<v Speaker 5>spa,</v>

4113
03:05:20.600 --> 03:05:21.433
<v Speaker 5>get specific with their skillset,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we're more susceptible to brain </v>

4114
03:05:24.681 --> 03:05:25.514
<v Speaker 5>damage.</v>

4115
03:05:25.670 --> 03:05:26.503
<v Speaker 5>But it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're talking about like a woman </v>

4116
03:05:27.980 --> 03:05:31.320
<v Speaker 5>protecting that other woman.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

4117
03:05:31.321 --> 03:05:32.154
<v Speaker 5>100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I do a bit about how women are </v>

4118
03:05:33.321 --> 03:05:35.810
<v Speaker 5>socialist mentor capital.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's where it's like women,</v>

4119
03:05:35.811 --> 03:05:36.321
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

4120
03:05:36.321 --> 03:05:38.810
<v Speaker 5>she's having a bad night.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We all have to go home,</v>

4121
03:05:38.811 --> 03:05:40.400
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a linker tiers.</v>

4122
03:05:40.401 --> 03:05:43.070
<v Speaker 5>Ice cream man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Or like he's been a buzzkill fucking cut</v>

4123
03:05:43.071 --> 03:05:43.904
<v Speaker 5>the week.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4124
03:05:44.180 --> 03:05:47.210
<v Speaker 5>And the opposite is true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We have to go home for debbie.</v>

4125
03:05:47.270 --> 03:05:48.200
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the opposite is true.</v>

4126
03:05:48.201 --> 03:05:50.330
<v Speaker 5>Where it's like he's the fastest.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's like he's the funniest.</v>

4127
03:05:50.331 --> 03:05:52.070
<v Speaker 5>Let's make him king.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And women are like,</v>

4128
03:05:52.071 --> 03:05:53.720
<v Speaker 5>she has herpes tell everyone or.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

4129
03:05:53.730 --> 03:05:54.970
<v Speaker 5>she's the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's the prettiest.</v>

4130
03:05:55.000 --> 03:05:58.730
<v Speaker 5>Everyone she has herpes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the tallest nail gets hammered down</v>

4131
03:05:58.731 --> 03:05:59.564
<v Speaker 5>because in a galitary in societies like </v>
<v Speaker 5>the gatherers have to be like the same </v>

4132
03:06:02.421 --> 03:06:04.700
<v Speaker 5>and the hunters value skill,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it's like,</v>

4133
03:06:04.701 --> 03:06:06.710
<v Speaker 5>can you shut your mouth and shoot a </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking gun?</v>

4136
03:06:11.601 --> 03:06:12.261
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's share.</v>

4137
03:06:12.261 --> 03:06:15.850

<v Speaker 5>I don't want to talk shit about debbie.</v>

4138
03:06:16.070 --> 03:06:18.140
<v Speaker 5>I just realized while drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're definitely drunk.</v>

4139
03:06:18.170 --> 03:06:19.580
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the point I made is still valid.</v>

4140
03:06:19.610 --> 03:06:20.443
<v Speaker 5>The were good for awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he didn't know how to get off the </v>

4141
03:06:22.341 --> 03:06:24.890
<v Speaker 5>horse.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I said babies instead of berries.</v>

4142
03:06:24.920 --> 03:06:25.790
<v Speaker 5>That happens,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
