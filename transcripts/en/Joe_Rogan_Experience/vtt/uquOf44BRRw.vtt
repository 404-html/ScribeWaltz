1
00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.051
<v Speaker 1>Try My day,</v>

2
00:00:01.051 --> 00:00:03.720
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.</v>

3
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:04.681
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're,</v>

4
00:00:04.681 --> 00:00:08.300
<v Speaker 1>you're seeing all these new approaches constantly changing.</v>

5
00:00:08.301 --> 00:00:09.540
<v Speaker 1>So many great minds involved.</v>

6
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:10.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

7
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.051
<v Speaker 1>that's what I liked.</v>

8
00:00:11.051 --> 00:00:14.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean fear us a hobby and I meet them on the list can go on,</v>

9
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:14.910
<v Speaker 1>but that's what,</v>

10
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:15.360
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>

11
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.650
<v Speaker 1>that's what I've become now a bit of more of a nerd because you call somebody</v>

12
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:19.440
<v Speaker 1>fights and you,</v>

13
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.760
<v Speaker 1>you try to have a life as well,</v>

14
00:00:20.761 --> 00:00:22.350
<v Speaker 1>but I'm really now getting back into,</v>

15
00:00:22.351 --> 00:00:22.770
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

16
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.230
<v Speaker 1>let's catch up and see what these different minds are saying.</v>

17
00:00:25.231 --> 00:00:26.310
<v Speaker 1>Well you yourself sir,</v>

18
00:00:26.311 --> 00:00:27.150
<v Speaker 1>even you know,</v>

19
00:00:27.151 --> 00:00:27.931
<v Speaker 1>listening to this,</v>

20
00:00:27.931 --> 00:00:31.620
<v Speaker 1>it's just always so cool to hear different perspectives and okay,</v>

21
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:32.693
<v Speaker 1>what's going to work.</v>

22
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:34.800
<v Speaker 1>It's super important for all of us.</v>

23
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.630
<v Speaker 1>I think that's why Bj's going to do good.</v>

24
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:37.321
<v Speaker 1>It really,</v>

25
00:00:37.321 --> 00:00:40.830
<v Speaker 1>I truly believe because he changed cab.</v>

26
00:00:40.831 --> 00:00:42.060
<v Speaker 1>I think talent,</v>

27
00:00:42.061 --> 00:00:44.520
<v Speaker 1>like Bj in his training in Hawaii,</v>

28
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.061
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

29
00:00:45.061 --> 00:00:46.800
<v Speaker 1>he kind of dictates whatever he wants to do.</v>

30
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:47.670
<v Speaker 1>He's so talented.</v>

31
00:00:47.671 --> 00:00:48.660
<v Speaker 1>He schools people around.</v>

32
00:00:48.661 --> 00:00:50.550
<v Speaker 1>And that's why when you put people like that on a pressure,</v>

33
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.060
<v Speaker 1>they get tired because they never experienced that in the ring because he's so</v>

34
00:00:54.061 --> 00:00:55.470
<v Speaker 1>way ahead above of everybody else.</v>

35
00:00:55.471 --> 00:00:58.680
<v Speaker 1>So if they want to do extra three rounds with them and he doesn't want to do it,</v>

36
00:00:58.681 --> 00:00:59.370
<v Speaker 1>he's going to have,</v>

37
00:00:59.370 --> 00:00:59.951
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to do it.</v>

38
00:00:59.951 --> 00:01:02.360
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a batch of that trick at Greg Winkle.</v>

39
00:01:02.361 --> 00:01:02.940
<v Speaker 1>John,</v>

40
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:03.241
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

41
00:01:03.241 --> 00:01:05.040
<v Speaker 1>and there he's got all these guys gunning for him.</v>

42
00:01:05.041 --> 00:01:05.641
<v Speaker 1>It's a legend.</v>

43
00:01:05.641 --> 00:01:06.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm,</v>

44
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.430
<v Speaker 1>I can only imagine the sparring sessions they have going on.</v>

45
00:01:08.431 --> 00:01:09.960
<v Speaker 1>I think it's going to do really well for him.</v>

46
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.980
<v Speaker 1>It's opponent.</v>

47
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.521
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

48
00:01:11.521 --> 00:01:12.570
<v Speaker 1>Rodriguez is really good.</v>

49
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:13.220
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

50
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.480
<v Speaker 1>But I think the whole,</v>

51
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.991
<v Speaker 1>honestly,</v>

52
00:01:15.991 --> 00:01:16.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean the,</v>

53
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.490
<v Speaker 1>he's a hall of Famer,</v>

54
00:01:17.491 --> 00:01:20.070
<v Speaker 1>done everything of w we saw against Frankie Edgar.</v>

55
00:01:20.071 --> 00:01:20.580
<v Speaker 1>What does it,</v>

56
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.110
<v Speaker 1>we talked about our podcast the last,</v>

57
00:01:22.111 --> 00:01:23.070
<v Speaker 1>when was Matt Hughes?</v>

58
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.460
<v Speaker 1>2010 do you,</v>

59
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:26.130
<v Speaker 1>why do you think he's still fighting?</v>

60
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.731
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

61
00:01:26.731 --> 00:01:28.950
<v Speaker 1>he probably feels like he didn't do it right.</v>

62
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.860
<v Speaker 1>He probably feels like the fights he took with Frankie.</v>

63
00:01:31.861 --> 00:01:36.370
<v Speaker 1>We had that really bizarre standups stance was that was the weirdest thing guy</v>

64
00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.111
<v Speaker 1>I've ever seen.</v>

65
00:01:37.111 --> 00:01:40.380
<v Speaker 1>He decided that he was gonna fight that way because it was more efficient and it</v>

66
00:01:40.381 --> 00:01:43.260
<v Speaker 1>didn't use as much energy as like widening his stance.</v>

67
00:01:43.261 --> 00:01:43.981
<v Speaker 1>And He,</v>

68
00:01:43.981 --> 00:01:48.981
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of his career he was concerned with losing his energy in the ring.</v>

69
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.620
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

70
00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:50.311
<v Speaker 1>A lot of his crew,</v>

71
00:01:50.311 --> 00:01:51.570
<v Speaker 1>he's worried about gassing him.</v>

72
00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.190
<v Speaker 1>So then he went with Mark Marinovich.</v>

73
00:01:53.191 --> 00:01:53.461
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

74
00:01:53.461 --> 00:01:57.000
<v Speaker 1>So he does these two camps with Marvin or intervention at least two camps.</v>

75
00:01:57.001 --> 00:01:57.450
<v Speaker 1>Correct?</v>

76
00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.970
<v Speaker 1>He did Sean Sherk and I think he did Diego Sanchez.</v>

77
00:01:59.971 --> 00:02:00.391
<v Speaker 1>I know he did.</v>

78
00:02:00.391 --> 00:02:01.230
<v Speaker 1>Diego Sanchez.</v>

79
00:02:01.231 --> 00:02:05.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah cause I know also that Steve Maxwell was training Diego Sanchez got Sanchez</v>

80
00:02:05.401 --> 00:02:06.490
<v Speaker 1>and incredible shame.</v>

81
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.190
<v Speaker 1>But that was Bj in his prime and when Bj wasn't tired when he was in shape and</v>

82
00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.630
<v Speaker 1>he was joking around about it.</v>

83
00:02:12.631 --> 00:02:13.680
<v Speaker 1>Like when I have a six pack,</v>

84
00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.110
<v Speaker 1>oh my aunt took him know what was it?</v>

85
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.390
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't just a different animal back then,</v>

86
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.300
<v Speaker 1>but it was only sustainable for like a few fights.</v>

87
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.410
<v Speaker 1>I think like Bj,</v>

88
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.320
<v Speaker 1>it's for whatever reason,</v>

89
00:02:25.321 --> 00:02:29.280
<v Speaker 1>it was hard for him to get totally motivated to get into that kind of shape</v>

90
00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.731
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

91
00:02:29.731 --> 00:02:30.350
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

92
00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:31.111
<v Speaker 1>when he described it,</v>

93
00:02:31.111 --> 00:02:33.720
<v Speaker 1>it sounded helacious like he couldn't hold his daughter literally,</v>

94
00:02:33.721 --> 00:02:37.710
<v Speaker 1>literally so tired after working out that he couldn't even hold his kid.</v>

95
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.700
<v Speaker 1>And they have a very specific training philosophy to the Marinovich is,</v>

96
00:02:41.701 --> 00:02:42.270
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

97
00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.410
<v Speaker 1>in a lot of ways,</v>

98
00:02:43.411 --> 00:02:44.010
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

99
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

100
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.360
<v Speaker 1>some of the guys that,</v>

101
00:02:45.361 --> 00:02:45.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

102
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.500
<v Speaker 1>like nick curse on who trains under his philosophy and a speed of sport in</v>

103
00:02:49.501 --> 00:02:50.334
<v Speaker 1>California,</v>

104
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.090
<v Speaker 1>they want strength and conditioning to be number one priority number one,</v>

105
00:02:54.091 --> 00:02:54.980
<v Speaker 1>you already know how to fight.</v>

106
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.853
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>

107
00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:56.281
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

108
00:02:56.281 --> 00:02:57.900
<v Speaker 1>And the idea is that you already know how to find,</v>

109
00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.650
<v Speaker 1>so since [inaudible] how to fight,</v>

110
00:02:59.651 --> 00:03:04.090
<v Speaker 1>you should just work on having the most incredible aerobic threshold that goes</v>

111
00:03:04.091 --> 00:03:07.930
<v Speaker 1>back to frank and a plan to Ortiz.</v>

112
00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

113
00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.680
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

114
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.070
<v Speaker 1>but even Franco with the,</v>

115
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.140
<v Speaker 1>why am I going to Kip Maury Smith with a node deck partner show you at the</v>

116
00:03:14.141 --> 00:03:14.501
<v Speaker 1>beginning,</v>

117
00:03:14.501 --> 00:03:16.310
<v Speaker 1>that's what frank was all about was the,</v>

118
00:03:16.311 --> 00:03:17.200
<v Speaker 1>the couldn't be cardio.</v>

119
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.120
<v Speaker 1>Cardio was on the bus back.</v>

120
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.690
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

121
00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.450
<v Speaker 1>when Tito loss to frank,</v>

122
00:03:22.451 --> 00:03:25.200
<v Speaker 1>I was in the same bus going back to the airport at Tito,</v>

123
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.450
<v Speaker 1>jump next to me and he starts asking me question about stamina because I always</v>

124
00:03:28.451 --> 00:03:31.480
<v Speaker 1>said is the most important thing you can never have enough stamina.</v>

125
00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.810
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

126
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.210
<v Speaker 1>The most important that you start asking drills and doing the all these things.</v>

127
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.530
<v Speaker 1>And then he became debt.</v>

128
00:03:35.531 --> 00:03:37.210
<v Speaker 1>Crazy cycle,</v>

129
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.571
<v Speaker 1>cardio,</v>

130
00:03:37.571 --> 00:03:38.380
<v Speaker 1>cardio,</v>

131
00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.680
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

132
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:39.790
<v Speaker 1>And he started beating everybody,</v>

133
00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.633
<v Speaker 1>showing me,</v>

134
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.900
<v Speaker 1>transferred that to Kendall Grove and trained under the ultimate fighter when</v>

135
00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.090
<v Speaker 1>Kendell came out of that show.</v>

136
00:03:46.091 --> 00:03:46.960
<v Speaker 1>And that's what he told me.</v>

137
00:03:46.961 --> 00:03:47.231
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

138
00:03:47.231 --> 00:03:48.160
<v Speaker 1>it's all cardio man.</v>

139
00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:50.650
<v Speaker 1>Everything is about cardio and but again,</v>

140
00:03:50.651 --> 00:03:52.090
<v Speaker 1>cardio also.</v>

141
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.790
<v Speaker 1>What about the nerves then in how much panicking and your,</v>

142
00:03:55.791 --> 00:03:56.890
<v Speaker 1>your emotions drained?</v>

143
00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.840
<v Speaker 1>Like what I'm saying is a factor in it,</v>

144
00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.040
<v Speaker 1>but the actual real cold hard cardio plays a factor too.</v>

145
00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.340
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

146
00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:04.960
<v Speaker 1>And it also plays a factor in your nerves.</v>

147
00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

148
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.430
<v Speaker 1>Because if you know that you have a small gas tank and they started to give it</v>

149
00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.720
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

150
00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:09.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

151
00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.050
<v Speaker 1>And especially when you walk to the ring.</v>

152
00:04:11.051 --> 00:04:12.220
<v Speaker 1>Did I train hard enough?</v>

153
00:04:12.221 --> 00:04:12.441
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

154
00:04:12.441 --> 00:04:14.320
<v Speaker 1>cause you know that you can really go,</v>

155
00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

156
00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:15.710
<v Speaker 1>after work I done,</v>

157
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:16.391
<v Speaker 1>we'll do seven,</v>

158
00:04:16.391 --> 00:04:17.260
<v Speaker 1>six minutes round.</v>

159
00:04:17.261 --> 00:04:18.910
<v Speaker 1>So the type at full blast,</v>

160
00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:20.500
<v Speaker 1>that's like 42 minutes.</v>

161
00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.950
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

162
00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:21.330
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

163
00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:22.870
<v Speaker 1>and but that was after a workout.</v>

164
00:04:22.871 --> 00:04:24.340
<v Speaker 1>But I knew that nobody did that.</v>

165
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:25.960
<v Speaker 1>So I was not going to run out against,</v>

166
00:04:25.961 --> 00:04:27.370
<v Speaker 1>because we had half our fights in the,</v>

167
00:04:27.371 --> 00:04:28.180
<v Speaker 1>in Japan.</v>

168
00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:29.760
<v Speaker 1>But it's the only way to do it.</v>

169
00:04:29.761 --> 00:04:30.670
<v Speaker 1>Chances are they go hard.</v>

170
00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.690
<v Speaker 1>And I had guys coming who couldn't do the warmup in my class.</v>

171
00:04:33.691 --> 00:04:37.190
<v Speaker 1>This is a 20 minute warmup is the boss where workout with the sprawls and in a</v>

172
00:04:37.191 --> 00:04:37.930
<v Speaker 1>minutes we built,</v>

173
00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.110
<v Speaker 1>I fill them up with the IDA pushups or with the Kettlebell swings.</v>

174
00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.340
<v Speaker 1>So it's 20 minutes straight.</v>

175
00:04:42.341 --> 00:04:46.300
<v Speaker 1>People come in who had a fight like in two weeks in Japan and he couldn't do it.</v>

176
00:04:46.301 --> 00:04:46.931
<v Speaker 1>They had dead man.</v>

177
00:04:46.931 --> 00:04:47.201
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

178
00:04:47.201 --> 00:04:47.770
<v Speaker 1>don't fight.</v>

179
00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.951
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

180
00:04:47.951 --> 00:04:48.311
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean?</v>

181
00:04:48.311 --> 00:04:48.551
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

182
00:04:48.551 --> 00:04:49.240
<v Speaker 1>this is the warmup.</v>

183
00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.020
<v Speaker 1>We didn't even start now and neutral.</v>

184
00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.620
<v Speaker 1>So say they lost because of cardio over there,</v>

185
00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:54.760
<v Speaker 1>but he's not shy.</v>

186
00:04:54.761 --> 00:04:55.650
<v Speaker 1>But how do you do this?</v>

187
00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:55.901
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

188
00:04:55.901 --> 00:04:56.681
<v Speaker 1>it's just baby steps.</v>

189
00:04:56.681 --> 00:05:00.130
<v Speaker 1>It is just get yourself to the point where you can get through that entire warm</v>

190
00:05:00.131 --> 00:05:00.401
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

191
00:05:00.401 --> 00:05:01.970
<v Speaker 1>full clip and then just get,</v>

192
00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.921
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

193
00:05:02.921 --> 00:05:03.591
<v Speaker 1>just keep doing it.</v>

194
00:05:03.591 --> 00:05:04.424
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

195
00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.153
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

196
00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:13.470
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
