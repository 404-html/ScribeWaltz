00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.350
<v Speaker 1>Almost too huge.</v>

45
00:01:31.351 --> 00:01:32.310
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was almost to the month,</v>

46
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:33.260
<v Speaker 1>but then,</v>

47
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

48
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:34.530
<v Speaker 1>when I first got it,</v>

49
00:01:34.531 --> 00:01:37.890
<v Speaker 1>I took it to England and that was on the phone a lot,</v>

50
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.650
<v Speaker 1>like doing text messages and emails and stuff.</v>

51
00:01:40.651 --> 00:01:41.011
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

52
00:01:41.011 --> 00:01:44.160
<v Speaker 1>this is a much better experience for that much better.</v>

53
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to shut it off.</v>

54
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:47.573
<v Speaker 1>So if everything,</v>

55
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.810
<v Speaker 1>so you were just a here just with a hearing and Henner in Manchester,</v>

56

57
00:01:54.931 --> 00:01:55.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

58
00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:56.240

64
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:02.110
<v Speaker 1>is that who you're talking to?</v>

65
00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.750
<v Speaker 1>And I was training with him and I'm a black belt under here and in Henner and</v>

66
00:02:06.751 --> 00:02:10.170
<v Speaker 1>then I kind of migrated to hearing you the bad ass of the intellectuals.</v>

67
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.060
<v Speaker 1>Now when you go look the skeptic conferences,</v>

68
00:02:12.061 --> 00:02:12.930
<v Speaker 1>they have seminars.</v>

69
00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:14.530
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.770
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

71
00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:15.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

72
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I've been to a skeptic's conference since I started,</v>

73
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.961
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

74
00:02:18.961 --> 00:02:20.460
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't say Steph skeptic conference,</v>

75
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:21.570
<v Speaker 1>I should say debate.</v>

76
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.450
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

77
00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.890
<v Speaker 1>you've,</v>

78
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.560
<v Speaker 1>you've been in quite a few very entertaining debates online,</v>

79
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:26.340
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

80
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.720
<v Speaker 1>more atheist than skeptic,</v>

81
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.201
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

82
00:02:28.201 --> 00:02:28.960
<v Speaker 1>With the,</v>

83
00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:29.200
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

84
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.440
<v Speaker 1>there was one that you did with this really smart dude.</v>

85
00:02:31.441 --> 00:02:32.460
<v Speaker 1>It was really fascinating.</v>

86
00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:33.150
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

87
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.440
<v Speaker 1>I believe he was a Jewish guy and he was so passionate about,</v>

88
00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.341
<v Speaker 1>about religion.</v>

89
00:02:38.341 --> 00:02:42.510
<v Speaker 1>He was so passionate about the intellectual pursuit of religion and it was</v>

90
00:02:42.511 --> 00:02:44.640
<v Speaker 1>really fascinating to watch him like we've,</v>

91
00:02:44.641 --> 00:02:45.474
<v Speaker 1>his dance,</v>

92
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.700
<v Speaker 1>like he tried to make it seem like it made sense.</v>

93
00:02:47.701 --> 00:02:48.534
<v Speaker 1>It clearly didn't,</v>

94
00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.520
<v Speaker 1>but it was fascinating to watch him.</v>

95
00:02:50.521 --> 00:02:55.521
<v Speaker 1>We've this dance and it was all pros and delivery and drama and you put it</v>

96
00:02:56.461 --> 00:02:57.770
<v Speaker 1>together in such an entertaining for,</v>

97
00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:58.690
<v Speaker 1>you almost want to go with them.</v>

98
00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:59.020
<v Speaker 1>Like God,</v>

99
00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.620
<v Speaker 1>maybe.</v>

100
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:00.453
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there is a god.</v>

101
00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:01.660
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the Bible's true.</v>

102
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.450
<v Speaker 1>I think you're talking about a rabbi Wolpe yes,</v>

103
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.600
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what I'm talking about.</v>

104
00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:06.443
<v Speaker 1>Debate at twice,</v>

105
00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:07.211
<v Speaker 1>once alone,</v>

106
00:03:07.211 --> 00:03:12.211
<v Speaker 1>and once with Hitchins and it was Hitchins and I against role hoping in another</v>

107
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:13.623
<v Speaker 1>rabbi.</v>

108
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.080
<v Speaker 1>You get accused of something that I think is very fascinating.</v>

109
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.940
<v Speaker 1>You get accused of Islamophobia and it's by liberals and progressives.</v>

110
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.260
<v Speaker 1>There's this new thing that's really interesting to me that you can goof on</v>

111
00:03:26.261 --> 00:03:28.270
<v Speaker 1>Christianity to the fucking cows come home,</v>

112
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.420
<v Speaker 1>you can shit on Mormonism and polygamy and any other cult Scientology.</v>

113
00:03:34.211 --> 00:03:35.770
<v Speaker 1>You can goof on anything and no one says a peep.</v>

114
00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.380
<v Speaker 1>But if you say anything about Islam,</v>

115
00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.510
<v Speaker 1>progressive people will dean you Islamophobic and they'll say there's something</v>

116
00:03:43.511 --> 00:03:43.991
<v Speaker 1>wrong with you.</v>

117
00:03:43.991 --> 00:03:47.200
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a really interesting thing that we do.</v>

118
00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.330
<v Speaker 1>And I show there's a lot of psychological reasons because you know we're,</v>

119
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.340
<v Speaker 1>we're bombing them because here there's less bendy right here and going back to</v>

120
00:03:57.341 --> 00:03:59.710
<v Speaker 1>this and you've gotta I handle,</v>

121
00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.100
<v Speaker 1>don't put your hand around.</v>

122
00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:02.083
<v Speaker 1>Put It on this.</v>

123
00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:03.140
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

124
00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.973
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

125
00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:05.870
<v Speaker 1>And if you're going to put your hand around,</v>

126
00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.750
<v Speaker 1>go like this and squeeze the fingers together.</v>

127
00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:09.440
<v Speaker 1>You like that?</v>

128
00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.681
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

129
00:04:09.681 --> 00:04:12.500
<v Speaker 1>not the small finger right here.</v>

130
00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.911
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

131
00:04:13.911 --> 00:04:14.744
<v Speaker 1>now it's squeezed them.</v>

132
00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:16.310
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

133
00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.220
<v Speaker 1>now you're cutting the blood spy off the thumb a little bit.</v>

134
00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.940
<v Speaker 1>A little bit.</v>

135
00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:20.773
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

136
00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.370
<v Speaker 1>This is a curl.</v>

137
00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.900
<v Speaker 1>This is a rip curl and rip curl and rip.</v>

138
00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.310
<v Speaker 1>And you get used to that.</v>

139
00:04:28.311 --> 00:04:31.220
<v Speaker 1>And when you're cranking guy's neck or choking him,</v>

140
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.810
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't slip.</v>

141
00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.650
<v Speaker 1>If you squeeze the thumb and also you know,</v>

142
00:04:36.651 --> 00:04:36.861
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

143
00:04:36.861 --> 00:04:39.380
<v Speaker 1>you're going like this and it might slip off.</v>

144
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.790
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

145
00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:40.780
<v Speaker 1>But it's my slip.</v>

146
00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:41.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

147
00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:42.110
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

148
00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:43.010
<v Speaker 1>not that finger.</v>

149
00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:44.473
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

150
00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:45.261
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

151
00:04:45.261 --> 00:04:46.580
<v Speaker 1>Now Curl and Rep.</v>

152
00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.630
<v Speaker 1>So you feel like this is more stable than I do of all.</v>

153
00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.560
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

154
00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:52.393
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

155
00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.230
<v Speaker 1>I always see this this way.</v>

156
00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.270
<v Speaker 1>Now you're going like this,</v>

157
00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:01.540
<v Speaker 1>you're using your back to c and you're pulling them in clothes.</v>

158
00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:04.670
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't feel like you smash your fingers.</v>

159
00:05:04.671 --> 00:05:06.050
<v Speaker 1>Like this is the time.</v>

160
00:05:06.051 --> 00:05:06.580
<v Speaker 1>But just,</v>

161
00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:07.550
<v Speaker 1>just the thumb.</v>

162
00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:09.290
<v Speaker 1>Squeeze the thumb.</v>

163
00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.300
<v Speaker 1>Are you squeezing the thumb,</v>

164
00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:12.500
<v Speaker 1>your theater,</v>

165
00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:13.333
<v Speaker 1>getting red.</v>

166
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.150
<v Speaker 1>Now as you squeeze the thumb and go like this,</v>

167
00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:18.230
<v Speaker 1>that's a curl.</v>

168
00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.250
<v Speaker 1>And this is a rep across his face.</v>

169
00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:24.643
<v Speaker 3>I like that.</v>

170
00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:25.710
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

171
00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:27.000
<v Speaker 1>Now do it the other side.</v>

172
00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:31.593
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

173
00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.110
<v Speaker 1>And go this way.</v>

174
00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:36.720
<v Speaker 1>Now you're still working out at the Machados or any of that.</v>

175
00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:37.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

176
00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:39.140
<v Speaker 1>And then he brought was to everybody.</v>

177
00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.501
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

178
00:05:39.501 --> 00:05:43.250
<v Speaker 1>I've been injured for a little bit about how big of a neck injury and it just</v>

179
00:05:43.251 --> 00:05:48.251
<v Speaker 1>got of time go car said to come by our place of not to prove yourself,</v>

180
00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:50.601
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

181
00:05:50.601 --> 00:05:54.910
<v Speaker 1>just to go there and see the place I used to have those days.</v>

182
00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:56.510
<v Speaker 1>They are,</v>

183
00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:57.610
<v Speaker 1>these are uh,</v>

184
00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.833
<v Speaker 2>peer counseling.</v>

185
00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.073
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

186
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.300
<v Speaker 2>I like to use these for the hook because even for,</v>

187
00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:06.951
<v Speaker 2>for kids,</v>

188
00:06:06.951 --> 00:06:09.110
<v Speaker 2>I had also it teaches the,</v>

189
00:06:09.111 --> 00:06:09.944
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

190
00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:10.980
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>

191
00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:11.310
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

192
00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:15.530
<v Speaker 2>it simulates a lot better cause I feel the pad when you're hitting something,</v>

193
00:06:15.531 --> 00:06:16.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm holding the myths,</v>

194
00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.890
<v Speaker 2>but they can actually see the power in this one.</v>

195
00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:20.061
<v Speaker 2>So when I teach it,</v>

196
00:06:20.061 --> 00:06:21.920
<v Speaker 2>I teach you like the karate kid hook.</v>

197
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:23.420
<v Speaker 2>Even all my students do this.</v>

198
00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:24.641
<v Speaker 2>So you didn't,</v>

199
00:06:24.641 --> 00:06:27.770
<v Speaker 2>you know the credit kid when he has a on the bow and the,</v>

200
00:06:27.771 --> 00:06:29.210
<v Speaker 2>he was in the island and the guy was,</v>

201
00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.980
<v Speaker 2>he had the drum thing,</v>

202
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.370
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

203
00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:32.930
<v Speaker 2>And everybody was doing it right.</v>

204
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:36.950
<v Speaker 2>So it's kind of like that because you're spinning your hip and your whole hook</v>

205
00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:40.970
<v Speaker 2>comes from your hip and your arm is just a rope in your hand as a rock.</v>

206
00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:42.261
<v Speaker 2>So I tell people,</v>

207
00:06:42.261 --> 00:06:43.910
<v Speaker 2>visualize your hand being a rock.</v>

208
00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:44.601
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

209
00:06:44.601 --> 00:06:45.830
<v Speaker 2>and you're harming a rope,</v>

210
00:06:45.831 --> 00:06:47.120
<v Speaker 2>no power in your arm.</v>

211
00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:48.440
<v Speaker 2>Your arm is relaxed,</v>

212
00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:49.700
<v Speaker 2>your hand is tight,</v>

213
00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.590
<v Speaker 2>and it all starts from your hip.</v>

214
00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:56.780
<v Speaker 2>So just so just turns that way and you spin it and you don't stop.</v>

215
00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:01.080
<v Speaker 2>You go in this direction has almost the same with the right hook,</v>

216
00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:02.240
<v Speaker 2>but it's mainly the left took,</v>

217
00:07:02.241 --> 00:07:03.110
<v Speaker 2>I teach that way.</v>

218
00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:04.610
<v Speaker 2>So it's like a whip,</v>

219
00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:05.541
<v Speaker 2>it's like a whip,</v>

220
00:07:05.541 --> 00:07:09.200
<v Speaker 2>but you're hitting them with a rock and most efficient use of movements.</v>

221
00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:09.980
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

222
00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:11.690
<v Speaker 2>and then the commitment is not there.</v>

223
00:07:11.691 --> 00:07:12.710
<v Speaker 2>Like with a right hand,</v>

224
00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:13.970
<v Speaker 2>if I throw it hard,</v>

225
00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:17.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm giving the person my hip so the wrestler could get my hip.</v>

226
00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.040
<v Speaker 2>When I'm throwing my hook,</v>

227
00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:22.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying my hip over there on the way past,</v>

228
00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:24.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to hit their chin from my hip's going here.</v>

229
00:07:24.951 --> 00:07:26.480
<v Speaker 2>So even if it's a wrestler,</v>

230
00:07:26.481 --> 00:07:27.770
<v Speaker 2>I just step out this way.</v>

231
00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:31.340
<v Speaker 2>It's easier to defend a take down cause I'll commit all the way.</v>

232
00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:34.670
<v Speaker 2>Even taking my eyes off him cause it's really hard to counter this hook.</v>

233
00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.130
<v Speaker 2>He might grab her single and I can step through,</v>

234
00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:39.350
<v Speaker 2>but I want all my coat hook.</v>

235
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:41.510
<v Speaker 2>So when I'm did hooks I did it this way.</v>

236
00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:42.583
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

237
00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:43.630
<v Speaker 2>and when I,</v>

238
00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:46.040
<v Speaker 2>when I teach them not coming back first,</v>

239
00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:50.120
<v Speaker 2>the way I teach them to not pull back first is have this guy tried to drop it</v>

240
00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:54.410
<v Speaker 2>because you'll see a guy like this and then they pulled back to,</v>

241
00:07:54.411 --> 00:07:55.880
<v Speaker 2>so the hook every time.</v>

242
00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:58.490
<v Speaker 2>But if you're out here more like I used to have chuck find out here.</v>

243
00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:01.100
<v Speaker 2>So then from here it says he steps in,</v>

244
00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:02.540
<v Speaker 2>you can just turn it right over.</v>

245
00:08:02.541 --> 00:08:03.560
<v Speaker 2>So if he's right here,</v>

246
00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:05.420
<v Speaker 2>you don't pull it back first.</v>

247
00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:06.283
<v Speaker 2>He can drill that.</v>

248
00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:07.600
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>

249
00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:08.433
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>

250
00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:11.370
<v Speaker 4>And so it's ascending,</v>

251
00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:13.890
<v Speaker 4>it's going to get a network connection with other second.</v>

252
00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:14.641
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

253
00:08:14.641 --> 00:08:15.360
<v Speaker 4>great.</v>

254
00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.193
<v Speaker 4>So this is easy.</v>

255
00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:17.543
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

256
00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:19.820
<v Speaker 4>yeah android APP is much nicer than the iPhone is it?</v>

257
00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:20.170
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

258
00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:23.280
<v Speaker 4>Cause at first it was really annoying.</v>

259
00:08:23.281 --> 00:08:24.114
<v Speaker 4>So that's gone.</v>

260
00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:26.070
<v Speaker 4>So now if you go into your piggy bank,</v>

261
00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:30.030
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

262
00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:30.760
<v Speaker 4>wait a bit.</v>

263
00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:31.170
<v Speaker 4>That's all right.</v>

264
00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:31.920
<v Speaker 4>Don't phone.</v>

265
00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:32.760
<v Speaker 4>So I go send.</v>

266
00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:34.103
<v Speaker 4>That's all.</v>

267
00:08:34.290 --> 00:08:35.123
<v Speaker 4>I liked the Samsung.</v>

268
00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:35.730
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>

269
00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:36.510
<v Speaker 4>This is cool.</v>

270
00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:37.343

273
00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.540
<v Speaker 4>You know that resolution is not as good.</v>

274
00:08:48.541 --> 00:08:50.220
<v Speaker 4>It's actually the guts of the gs three,</v>

275
00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:51.643
<v Speaker 4>a galaxy</v>

276

<v Speaker 4>guts.</v>

277
00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:55.770
<v Speaker 4>It's not that good.</v>

278
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:57.300
<v Speaker 4>It's just big.</v>

279
00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:00.140
<v Speaker 4>But I gotta copy George Dress.</v>

280
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:01.050
<v Speaker 4>You see how it says one,</v>

281
00:09:01.051 --> 00:09:01.720
<v Speaker 4>three HC.</v>

282

<v Speaker 4>It's just to send me this in an easy way.</v>

283
00:09:03.421 --> 00:09:05.130
<v Speaker 4>You could also copy paste that in an email.</v>

284
00:09:05.131 --> 00:09:06.330
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing secret about this.</v>

285
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:07.590
<v Speaker 4>It's like an email address.</v>

286
00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:08.490
<v Speaker 4>Just your identifier.</v>

287
00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:11.430
<v Speaker 4>And at one point I say 0.005</v>

288
00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:13.993
<v Speaker 4>and said,</v>

289
00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.550
<v Speaker 4>and asked me for a second password because I'm trying to send money</v>

290
00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:26.960
<v Speaker 4>and then you just wait a few seconds.</v>

291
00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:28.820
<v Speaker 4>It's still sending on this side.</v>

292
00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:30.651
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

293
00:09:30.651 --> 00:09:31.484
<v Speaker 4>thank you.</v>

294
00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:36.993
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

295
00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:40.770
<v Speaker 4>Now this was not from my phone to your phone.</v>

296
00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:42.690
<v Speaker 4>This was from me to the bitcoin network.</v>

297
00:09:42.691 --> 00:09:44.040
<v Speaker 4>From the Big Horn network to your phone.</v>

298
00:09:44.041 --> 00:09:44.670
<v Speaker 4>So if you weren't,</v>

299
00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:46.500
<v Speaker 4>Kuala Lumpur would have taken the same amount of time.</v>

300
00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:48.473
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

301
00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:51.730
<v Speaker 4>Let's just mediated by the network.</v>

302
00:09:51.731 --> 00:09:56.620
<v Speaker 4>Now tell me when you could send $5 electronically to some random person without</v>

303
00:09:56.650 --> 00:09:58.660
<v Speaker 4>jumping through hoops and taking seven days.</v>

304
00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:02.320
<v Speaker 4>And I know this is a lot more than paypal obviously,</v>

305
00:10:02.321 --> 00:10:03.470
<v Speaker 4>but even as,</v>

306
00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:05.920
<v Speaker 4>as to how it does such a better job.</v>

307
00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:08.950
<v Speaker 4>And if I wanted to,</v>

308
00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:10.330
<v Speaker 4>I want them to freeze this by the way.</v>

309
00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:11.140
<v Speaker 4>No one,</v>

310
00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:11.973
<v Speaker 4>oh no,</v>

311
00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:16.210
<v Speaker 4>this is sitting on keys or a wallet on this phone.</v>

312
00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.150
<v Speaker 4>Also on the website to best as a backup.</v>

313
00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:19.871
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

314
00:10:19.871 --> 00:10:22.300
<v Speaker 4>if somebody wanted to buy more bitcoin,</v>

315
00:10:22.301 --> 00:10:23.470
<v Speaker 4>how would they go about doing that?</v>

316
00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:25.420
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

317
00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:26.560
<v Speaker 4>two ways for Americans.</v>

318
00:10:26.561 --> 00:10:30.910
<v Speaker 4>Probably the easiest one is you go to coinbase.com I can write it down for you.</v>

319
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
<v Speaker 4>So Coinbase is a San Francisco company.</v>

320
00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:35.530
<v Speaker 4>They work with the banks,</v>

321
00:10:35.531 --> 00:10:37.210
<v Speaker 4>they're registered as a money transmission.</v>

322
00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:38.860
<v Speaker 4>They've done some of the regulation.</v>

323
00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:41.140
<v Speaker 4>So connect via ACH,</v>

324
00:10:41.141 --> 00:10:42.430
<v Speaker 4>direct debit to your bank account.</v>

325
00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:45.730
<v Speaker 4>They'll do two small deposits to verify that it's yours and you give them,</v>

326
00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:46.031
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

327
00:10:46.031 --> 00:10:46.900
<v Speaker 4>like paperworks.</v>

328
00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:48.790
<v Speaker 4>And then once they've got that link up,</v>

329
00:10:48.791 --> 00:10:49.211
<v Speaker 4>you say,</v>

330
00:10:49.211 --> 00:10:52.480
<v Speaker 4>buy bitcoin $5,000 boom.</v>

331
00:10:52.481 --> 00:10:52.901
<v Speaker 4>It's going to say,</v>

332
00:10:52.901 --> 00:10:54.190
<v Speaker 4>this is the price we're going to get you.</v>

333
00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:58.150
<v Speaker 4>It's going to debit your account in four days and four days later your account</v>

334
00:10:58.151 --> 00:11:00.250
<v Speaker 4>debits the dollar accounts,</v>

335
00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:05.440
<v Speaker 4>and it's a bit coin appears in your bitcoin account and the long time it takes</v>

336
00:11:05.441 --> 00:11:06.940
<v Speaker 4>just because the dollar side is slow.</v>

337
00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:08.440
<v Speaker 4>Then once you have it in Bitcoin,</v>

338
00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:10.570
<v Speaker 4>you can send it to anywhere for 40 cents.</v>

339
00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:12.340
<v Speaker 4>It's the standard say by,</v>

340
00:11:12.341 --> 00:11:13.030
<v Speaker 4>it's great meeting you.</v>

341
00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:13.600
<v Speaker 4>Thank you so much.</v>

342
00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:14.590
<v Speaker 4>Can't wait to talk to you again.</v>
