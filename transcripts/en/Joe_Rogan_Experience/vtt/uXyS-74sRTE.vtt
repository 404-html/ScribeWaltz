1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:00.903
<v Speaker 1>Shy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2
00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:05.830
<v Speaker 1>we feel professional with headsets on </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're live.</v>

3
00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.100
<v Speaker 1>Welcome back Louis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.680
<v Speaker 1>thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nice to be back.</v>

5
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:09.893
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was saying before the podcast started </v>

6
00:00:11.381 --> 00:00:14.860
<v Speaker 1>that you sent me down a scientology </v>
<v Speaker 1>rabbit hole last night,</v>

7
00:00:14.861 --> 00:00:16.510
<v Speaker 1>my friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been down those before,</v>

8
00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.560
<v Speaker 1>but last night knowing that you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be on and looking forward to it</v>

9
00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.290
<v Speaker 1>eagerly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I uh,</v>

10
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:24.700
<v Speaker 1>I watched a lot of stuff.</v>

11
00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:26.540
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

12
00:00:26.541 --> 00:00:29.950
<v Speaker 2>I spent three years down the rabbit hole</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a,</v>

13
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:31.633
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when were you on the Internet where </v>

14
00:00:33.531 --> 00:00:34.940
<v Speaker 2>you just clicking around?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

15
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.210
<v Speaker 2>just on Youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's various very,</v>

16
00:00:38.211 --> 00:00:42.320
<v Speaker 2>very well resourced websites.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's one called clam bake.</v>

17
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:43.640
<v Speaker 2>I've been to that one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

18
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.070
<v Speaker 2>And then there's all the Tony Ortega </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

19
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's just whole worlds.</v>

20
00:00:48.111 --> 00:00:48.944
<v Speaker 2>And actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I know there's a lot to talk </v>

21
00:00:50.421 --> 00:00:51.254
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but perhaps the biggest obstacle to </v>

22
00:00:53.211 --> 00:00:57.980
<v Speaker 2>making a documentary about scientology </v>
<v Speaker 2>is the over abundance of material,</v>

23
00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.913
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's just so many ways to </v>

24
00:01:01.521 --> 00:01:02.354
<v Speaker 2>come in on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you could just chase intriguing </v>

25
00:01:04.431 --> 00:01:08.380
<v Speaker 2>leads and then months go by and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>known narrative filming it.</v>

26
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.560
<v Speaker 1>I had a lot of thoughts on this and one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the thoughts when I was really trying</v>

27
00:01:12.561 --> 00:01:17.561
<v Speaker 1>to unpack it all is that I feel like one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the reasons why a lot of these people</v>

28
00:01:17.751 --> 00:01:20.600
<v Speaker 1>defend scientology there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's several reasons.</v>

29
00:01:20.601 --> 00:01:21.434
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's their team and once you </v>

30
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:24.223
<v Speaker 1>become a part of a team,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes something that you identify </v>

31
00:01:26.361 --> 00:01:27.920
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes very important to you.</v>

32
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.200
<v Speaker 1>And then you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to defend that.</v>

33
00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:31.303
<v Speaker 1>So I think there's that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But also I think some people take some </v>

34
00:01:36.441 --> 00:01:40.730
<v Speaker 1>benefit in what l Ron Hubbard created </v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

35
00:01:40.731 --> 00:01:41.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

36
00:01:41.631 --> 00:01:43.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you read going clear.</v>

37
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.080
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I read going clear,</v>

38
00:01:45.081 --> 00:01:45.914
<v Speaker 1>I watched the documentary and then I </v>
<v Speaker 1>read the book and one of the things it </v>

39
00:01:47.391 --> 00:01:48.224
<v Speaker 1>was more fascinating about the book was </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that he was essentially trying </v>

40
00:01:51.501 --> 00:01:53.840
<v Speaker 1>to diagnose and treat himself.</v>

41
00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.890
<v Speaker 1>And he was essentially a really nutty </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

42
00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.080
<v Speaker 1>You was very damaged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

43
00:02:00.081 --> 00:02:01.850
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had a lot going on.</v>

44
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.013
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a guy who was trying to sort of </v>

45
00:02:07.281 --> 00:02:08.114
<v Speaker 1>sort it out himself and in the process </v>
<v Speaker 1>brought a lot of people in and then </v>

46
00:02:12.321 --> 00:02:17.060
<v Speaker 1>created this thing and some people they </v>
<v Speaker 1>get some benefit from this thing because</v>

47
00:02:17.061 --> 00:02:19.520
<v Speaker 1>like I was watching like some of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are upset with you,</v>

48
00:02:19.521 --> 00:02:20.354
<v Speaker 1>like that woman or that there was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>trailer where this woman was upset at </v>

49
00:02:23.361 --> 00:02:25.940
<v Speaker 1>you because you were in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen the documentary yet.</v>

50
00:02:25.941 --> 00:02:28.670
<v Speaker 1>It comes out in America in January.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

51
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.870
<v Speaker 1>but you were on a road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had a permit for and she was telling</v>

52
00:02:32.871 --> 00:02:34.100
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are on private land.</v>

53
00:02:34.101 --> 00:02:36.080
<v Speaker 1>And I'm looking at this woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

54
00:02:36.081 --> 00:02:38.180
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like a reasonable,</v>

55
00:02:38.181 --> 00:02:39.650
<v Speaker 1>intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>assertive,</v>

56
00:02:39.651 --> 00:02:43.040
<v Speaker 1>confident woman that would probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if she didn't get into scientology,</v>

57
00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.030
<v Speaker 1>she would have been successful in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporate world I'm sure.</v>

58
00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:48.283
<v Speaker 1>But here she is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her Corporation is written by a nutty </v>

59
00:02:52.401 --> 00:02:53.234
<v Speaker 1>science fiction writer who wrote more </v>
<v Speaker 1>fiction than any human has ever walked </v>

60
00:02:57.771 --> 00:03:00.050
<v Speaker 1>the face of the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

61
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.113
<v Speaker 2>he made up more shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wrote down more things that never </v>

62
00:03:03.881 --> 00:03:08.220
<v Speaker 2>happened than anyone who's ever lived.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they don't have a problem with that.</v>

63
00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.400
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

64
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:14.050
<v Speaker 2>you've said about 10 different things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I could break down and analyze.</v>

65
00:03:14.051 --> 00:03:15.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I basically on the same page as you.</v>

66
00:03:15.821 --> 00:03:16.654
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the first thing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>acknowledge about scientology is that </v>

67
00:03:19.241 --> 00:03:24.241
<v Speaker 2>it's a religion and that all religions </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a very high portion of,</v>

68
00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.430
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

69
00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.960
<v Speaker 2>to try to put it politely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just bogus,</v>

70
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.390
<v Speaker 2>fallacious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clearly nonsensical material.</v>

71
00:03:31.391 --> 00:03:33.400
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>In scientology is,</v>

72
00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:34.130
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

73
00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the same as all of those.</v>

74
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:36.543
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a lot of people who've </v>
<v Speaker 2>had derived a lot of benefit from </v>

75
00:03:38.531 --> 00:03:40.660
<v Speaker 2>scientology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think people probably.</v>

76
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.530
<v Speaker 2>There's people whose lives have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>saved by it.</v>

77
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.960
<v Speaker 2>Kirstie Alley,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll say at any opportunity that it was</v>

78
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.860
<v Speaker 2>scientology that got her off drugs.</v>

79
00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.730
<v Speaker 2>But I think a lot you have to sorta take</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole package.</v>

80
00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.100
<v Speaker 2>And we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as far as Hubbard goes,</v>

81
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.140
<v Speaker 2>he was an only child.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a fantasy,</v>

82
00:03:56.141 --> 00:04:00.040
<v Speaker 2>just a lonely guy who was also a </v>
<v Speaker 2>narcissist.</v>

83
00:04:00.041 --> 00:04:01.760
<v Speaker 2>And I think as a writer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

84
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:02.633
<v Speaker 2>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things in treatments about </v>

85
00:04:03.491 --> 00:04:05.890
<v Speaker 2>scientology is created by Scifi writer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

86
00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.250
<v Speaker 2>There's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most other religions are created by sort</v>

87
00:04:09.251 --> 00:04:12.610
<v Speaker 2>of desert mystics or mores or people </v>
<v Speaker 2>introspective people,</v>

88
00:04:12.611 --> 00:04:13.444
<v Speaker 2>but a modern day Scifi writer who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>writing things about aliens taking over </v>

89
00:04:17.651 --> 00:04:21.100
<v Speaker 2>foreign galaxies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's really that it accounts for a lot</v>

90
00:04:21.101 --> 00:04:22.210
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's um,</v>

91
00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.940
<v Speaker 2>it's very bizarre inflection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what I mean?</v>

92
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.511
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

93
00:04:25.511 --> 00:04:26.344
<v Speaker 2>not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he wrote a second draft </v>

94
00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:28.660
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

95
00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.330
<v Speaker 2>he didn't have time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was just sending it out.</v>

96
00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.490
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of the stuff that they say</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wrote,</v>

97
00:04:33.491 --> 00:04:34.324
<v Speaker 2>he didn't write like because he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>married three times and at least one of </v>

98
00:04:36.701 --> 00:04:38.950
<v Speaker 2>his wives took credit for writing some </v>
<v Speaker 2>of his stuff.</v>

99
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.903
<v Speaker 2>I think even some stuff of scientology </v>
<v Speaker 2>may be written by a second wife who we </v>

100
00:04:43.001 --> 00:04:43.834
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he subsequently disavowed said he was </v>

101
00:04:45.131 --> 00:04:47.320
<v Speaker 2>never married to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm,</v>

102
00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:48.880
<v Speaker 2>the guy was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

103
00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.560
<v Speaker 2>he lied about so many things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was also abusive to his wife.</v>

104
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.180
<v Speaker 2>Wives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think plural.</v>

105
00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.100
<v Speaker 2>So physically he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

106
00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:57.993
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

107
00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.040
<v Speaker 2>abusive to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was very,</v>

108
00:05:00.041 --> 00:05:00.874
<v Speaker 2>very troubled and suicidal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the most intriguing things in </v>

109
00:05:03.371 --> 00:05:06.090
<v Speaker 2>going clear is reading this list of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

110
00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:07.053
<v Speaker 2>I think they call them affirmations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which when he was in after the Second </v>

111
00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.190
<v Speaker 2>World War,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was right with self doubt.</v>

112
00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:13.293
<v Speaker 2>He thought it was a failure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was embarrassed about his sexual </v>

113
00:05:15.161 --> 00:05:16.300
<v Speaker 2>urgency,</v>
<v Speaker 2>urgency's,</v>

114
00:05:16.301 --> 00:05:19.240
<v Speaker 2>compulsive masturbation and so on and so</v>
<v Speaker 2>forth.</v>

115
00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:22.930
<v Speaker 2>And he wrote down a list of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember this section of it where</v>

116
00:05:22.931 --> 00:05:27.931
<v Speaker 2>it says you do not feel compelled to </v>
<v Speaker 2>mass conveyed 24 times a day?</v>

117
00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.130
<v Speaker 2>It's not literally everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

118
00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.680
<v Speaker 2>You are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were not a disgrace to the military.</v>

119
00:05:32.681 --> 00:05:34.870
<v Speaker 2>You were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you acquitted your service in the navy,</v>

120
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.033
<v Speaker 2>very creditably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was all these sort of lies he was </v>

121
00:05:37.601 --> 00:05:38.434
<v Speaker 2>telling himself to reassure himself that</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was actually to feel okay about </v>

122
00:05:42.731 --> 00:05:43.564
<v Speaker 2>himself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very humanizing document because </v>

123
00:05:45.701 --> 00:05:46.534
<v Speaker 2>you just see all his neurotic </v>
<v Speaker 2>inclinations laid bare that then </v>

124
00:05:50.681 --> 00:05:54.520
<v Speaker 2>subsequently informed his lifelong </v>
<v Speaker 2>attempt to,</v>

125
00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.980
<v Speaker 2>as you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of therapeutically healing himself.</v>

126
00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:58.100
<v Speaker 2>And I think</v>

127
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:03.100
<v Speaker 1>there's other people that identify with </v>
<v Speaker 1>those self sort of damaged thoughts,</v>

128
00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:06.980
<v Speaker 1>these thoughts where they don't like </v>
<v Speaker 1>their past.</v>

129
00:06:06.981 --> 00:06:09.140
<v Speaker 1>They don't like who they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't like the pattern that they're</v>

130
00:06:09.141 --> 00:06:09.974
<v Speaker 1>on and they seek to try to change that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and improve upon their position and </v>

131
00:06:14.421 --> 00:06:17.090
<v Speaker 1>improve upon their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their understanding and their acceptance</v>

132
00:06:17.091 --> 00:06:20.930
<v Speaker 1>of themselves and I think that's where </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientology does benefit a lot of people</v>

133
00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:23.960
<v Speaker 1>and so it is tricky like many things in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this life.</v>

134
00:06:23.961 --> 00:06:27.590
<v Speaker 1>It's not that black and white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean is it black and white that it's a</v>

135
00:06:27.591 --> 00:06:30.230
<v Speaker 1>cult and that there's a lot of damaging </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspects of that?</v>

136
00:06:30.231 --> 00:06:31.370
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

137
00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:32.353
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty clear when you see the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that have tried to leave it and </v>

138
00:06:35.141 --> 00:06:35.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

139
00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:37.980
<v Speaker 1>and tell the truth about their </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences in it and what,</v>

140
00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:40.820
<v Speaker 1>how they've been harassed and hounded </v>
<v Speaker 1>and yeah,</v>

141
00:06:40.821 --> 00:06:41.654
<v Speaker 1>that's all pretty black and white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think we can in some ways we can </v>

142
00:06:46.851 --> 00:06:49.190
<v Speaker 1>sympathize with some of the people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are in it.</v>

143
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:51.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

144
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:52.183
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the other thing to say is because </v>

145
00:06:53.491 --> 00:06:54.324
<v Speaker 2>you started by asking what was it that </v>
<v Speaker 2>made some people defend scientology and </v>

146
00:06:58.501 --> 00:06:59.334
<v Speaker 2>is it loyalty to the team?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I also think that I'm on the outer </v>

147
00:07:03.511 --> 00:07:06.150
<v Speaker 2>periphery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are concentric rings of commitment</v>

148
00:07:06.151 --> 00:07:08.070
<v Speaker 2>to scientology and in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>

149
00:07:08.071 --> 00:07:08.904
<v Speaker 2>in a circle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is extremely demanding and I would </v>

150
00:07:13.561 --> 00:07:16.710
<v Speaker 2>argue abusive and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

151
00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:20.850
<v Speaker 2>and cult like on the outer circles as </v>
<v Speaker 2>you get further from the center,</v>

152
00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:21.773
<v Speaker 2>I think it can be relatively benign and </v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're a vip or a </v>

153
00:07:25.231 --> 00:07:26.064
<v Speaker 2>celebrity in which you're exposed only </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the best sorts of treatment you're </v>

154
00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:33.240
<v Speaker 2>given kind of platinum card treatment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go to the celebrity center,</v>

155
00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:34.283
<v Speaker 2>they rolled out the red carpet for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think those people feel immensely </v>

156
00:07:37.381 --> 00:07:38.214
<v Speaker 2>indebted to scientology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that explains a lot about Tom </v>

157
00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:41.933
<v Speaker 2>Cruise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he's only ever been treated like a </v>

158
00:07:44.431 --> 00:07:46.940
<v Speaker 2>prince when he's been in scientology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he,</v>

159
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.590
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he feels so grateful for everything that</v>

160
00:07:49.591 --> 00:07:50.460
<v Speaker 2>they've done for him.</v>

161
00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:53.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think his experience when,</v>

162
00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:56.020
<v Speaker 1>when he talks about them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he's being honest,</v>

163
00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:58.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if everyone had that experience,</v>

164
00:07:58.991 --> 00:08:01.630
<v Speaker 1>scientology would be amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

165
00:08:01.631 --> 00:08:02.464
<v Speaker 1>when you see him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they had the happy birthday thing </v>

166
00:08:04.121 --> 00:08:06.460
<v Speaker 1>for him and he's dancing and everybody's</v>
<v Speaker 1>cheering,</v>

167
00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:09.850
<v Speaker 1>like imagine if you just people treated </v>
<v Speaker 1>you like that all the time.</v>

168
00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:13.550
<v Speaker 2>Oh my goodness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Auditioning actors like female actors to</v>

169
00:08:13.551 --> 00:08:16.460
<v Speaker 2>see if they were going to be your </v>
<v Speaker 2>girlfriend or did you read that whole,</v>

170
00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:17.393
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine if they rounded up the most </v>

171
00:08:19.461 --> 00:08:21.980
<v Speaker 2>attractive young female actors in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hollywood,</v>

172
00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:22.843
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to see whether they would go on a date </v>

173
00:08:24.351 --> 00:08:25.030
<v Speaker 2>with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

174
00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:27.920
<v Speaker 2>it would make life very simple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you weren't married as I am,</v>

175
00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:31.820
<v Speaker 2>would it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know man.</v>

176
00:08:31.821 --> 00:08:35.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean dealing with a bunch of nutty </v>
<v Speaker 2>paid through that process.</v>

177
00:08:35.571 --> 00:08:36.404
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And actually because it would be like </v>

178
00:08:38.841 --> 00:08:42.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm almost king midas thing where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't trust any of your instincts.</v>

179
00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:43.603
<v Speaker 2>You won't feel as though people were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were erecting potemkin villages </v>

180
00:08:47.061 --> 00:08:48.680
<v Speaker 2>everywhere you went.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what I mean?</v>

181
00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:50.180
<v Speaker 2>Nothing would feel quite real.</v>

182
00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:52.040
<v Speaker 1>That's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

183
00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:52.883
<v Speaker 1>like imagine your wife today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you found out that your wife today </v>

184
00:08:55.651 --> 00:08:56.010
<v Speaker 1>was one</v>

185
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:58.860
<v Speaker 3>of the people that had auditioned to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>Tom Cruise's wife.</v>

186
00:08:58.920 --> 00:08:59.753
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you don't make the cut,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're damaged goods for the rest of </v>

187
00:09:02.041 --> 00:09:03.270
<v Speaker 3>your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting too.</v>

188
00:09:03.271 --> 00:09:04.104
<v Speaker 3>You're a nutty broad who is willing to </v>
<v Speaker 3>go and sign up to become Tom Cruise's </v>

189
00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:09.360
<v Speaker 3>new wife.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

190
00:09:09.361 --> 00:09:10.194
<v Speaker 3>to be fair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't know that was the job they </v>

191
00:09:11.221 --> 00:09:13.230
<v Speaker 3>were going in to be fair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

192
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:14.410
<v Speaker 3>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

193
00:09:14.411 --> 00:09:15.244
<v Speaker 3>so just being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just thought they were up for some </v>

194
00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:19.980
<v Speaker 3>Gig,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you know what I mean?</v>

195
00:09:19.981 --> 00:09:22.470
<v Speaker 3>Maybe a Sitcom was essentially they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were.</v>

196
00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:28.210
<v Speaker 3>And then there's also all of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult things get screwed around with</v>

197
00:09:28.951 --> 00:09:32.130
<v Speaker 3>the scientology treatment of </v>
<v Speaker 3>homosexuals.</v>

198
00:09:32.131 --> 00:09:37.131
<v Speaker 3>Were they sort of shield them from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>press or hide their activity and sort of</v>

199
00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:40.350
<v Speaker 3>you don't want a beard is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do,</v>

200
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:42.900
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They hire beards,</v>

201
00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:44.011
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

202
00:09:44.011 --> 00:09:44.844
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's a great point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think actually that's another one </v>

203
00:09:46.951 --> 00:09:47.930
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

204
00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:49.200
<v Speaker 3>I guess we've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

205
00:09:49.201 --> 00:09:52.290
<v Speaker 3>we as a society have evolved a lot over </v>
<v Speaker 3>the last 50 years to some extent.</v>

206
00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:56.040
<v Speaker 3>Hubbard was a creature of his times in </v>
<v Speaker 3>his attitudes towards homosexuality.</v>

207
00:09:56.041 --> 00:09:59.430
<v Speaker 3>The trouble is because they're saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a religion that's been enshrined as</v>

208
00:09:59.431 --> 00:10:00.870
<v Speaker 3>scripture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so there are,</v>

209
00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:02.340
<v Speaker 3>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is l,</v>

210
00:10:02.341 --> 00:10:07.341
<v Speaker 3>Ron Hubbard scripture that dictates that</v>
<v Speaker 3>homosexuals are perverts.</v>

211
00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:12.120
<v Speaker 3>They're one point one on the tone scale,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the same as John List's,</v>

212
00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:13.470
<v Speaker 3>oddly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's very,</v>

213
00:10:13.471 --> 00:10:14.640
<v Speaker 3>very low.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Basically,</v>

214
00:10:14.641 --> 00:10:16.930
<v Speaker 3>you are kind of broken,</v>
<v Speaker 3>deceitful,</v>

215
00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:19.590
<v Speaker 3>a devious character.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Journalists are one point,</v>

216
00:10:19.591 --> 00:10:21.470
<v Speaker 3>one of the tone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>same as us,</v>

217
00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:23.100
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that she,</v>

218
00:10:23.101 --> 00:10:25.490
<v Speaker 3>I think quite explicitly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>explicitly.</v>

219
00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:26.483
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could go down and that explains a lot </v>

220
00:10:27.331 --> 00:10:30.810
<v Speaker 3>about why it's so hard to make a </v>
<v Speaker 3>documentary in practical terms,</v>

221
00:10:30.811 --> 00:10:32.640
<v Speaker 3>why they don't cooperate with </v>
<v Speaker 3>documentaries.</v>

222
00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:34.830
<v Speaker 3>They just see you as a pervert,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

223
00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:37.560
<v Speaker 3>if someone who's dedicated to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the,</v>

224
00:10:37.561 --> 00:10:38.394
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>basement of humanity and so someone </v>

225
00:10:39.581 --> 00:10:41.820
<v Speaker 3>who's holding humanity back from being </v>
<v Speaker 3>what it should be,</v>

226
00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:46.850
<v Speaker 3>but that's just incredible that he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>managed to define journalists under that</v>

227
00:10:47.521 --> 00:10:48.354
<v Speaker 3>category,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the very people that we rely upon to </v>

228
00:10:50.221 --> 00:10:52.600
<v Speaker 3>investigate the truth and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

229
00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:54.930
<v Speaker 3>and express that truth.</v>

230
00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:55.793
<v Speaker 3>Thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Disseminate that true to the general </v>

231
00:10:56.851 --> 00:10:59.220
<v Speaker 3>public.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those people are perverts and,</v>

232
00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:00.570
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

233
00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:02.490
<v Speaker 3>and that scripture as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

234
00:11:02.491 --> 00:11:03.324
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's not like you can argue against </v>

235
00:11:04.831 --> 00:11:05.664
<v Speaker 3>it until,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean one of the big things they're up </v>

236
00:11:08.581 --> 00:11:10.620
<v Speaker 3>against is any attempt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most,</v>

237
00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:14.190
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of malfunctioning regimes,</v>

238
00:11:14.191 --> 00:11:16.520
<v Speaker 3>whether it's a corporate entity or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something else.</v>

239
00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:18.030
<v Speaker 3>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this isn't working,</v>

240
00:11:18.031 --> 00:11:21.270
<v Speaker 3>let's try something else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So much of what happened in scientology,</v>

241
00:11:21.271 --> 00:11:24.750
<v Speaker 3>this was explained to me by one of our </v>
<v Speaker 3>sources in the in the film,</v>

242
00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:28.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm a guy called Marty Rathman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who was very high up in scientology.</v>

243
00:11:28.051 --> 00:11:31.470
<v Speaker 3>He said something could be working </v>
<v Speaker 3>extremely badly inside scientology,</v>

244
00:11:31.471 --> 00:11:35.190
<v Speaker 3>but if it came out of Hubbard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you couldn't really change it.</v>

245
00:11:35.191 --> 00:11:36.350
<v Speaker 3>Hubbard apparently once said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

246
00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:40.230
<v Speaker 3>the best way to wash windows is using </v>
<v Speaker 3>vinegar.</v>

247
00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:42.150
<v Speaker 3>Don't use windex,</v>
<v Speaker 3>use vinegar,</v>

248
00:11:42.151 --> 00:11:42.984
<v Speaker 3>and because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whenever they washed windows in the sea </v>

249
00:11:44.731 --> 00:11:46.770
<v Speaker 3>org and the inner sanctums of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Scientology,</v>

250
00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:50.490
<v Speaker 3>they had to use vinegar because Hubbard </v>
<v Speaker 3>said that was how you was supposed to do</v>

251
00:11:50.491 --> 00:11:53.950
<v Speaker 3>it and nothing can be changed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a bit like Mormons.</v>

252
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:55.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean now Mormons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how they got rid of.</v>

253
00:11:55.631 --> 00:11:57.490
<v Speaker 1>They say that you don't have to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>polygamous,</v>

254
00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:00.370
<v Speaker 1>but so it's like turning an aircraft </v>
<v Speaker 1>carrier around.</v>

255
00:12:00.371 --> 00:12:03.220
<v Speaker 1>If it comes from basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's Gospel,</v>

256
00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:05.460
<v Speaker 1>then how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you refer,</v>

257
00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:08.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God's changed his mind is basically what</v>

258
00:12:08.651 --> 00:12:09.910
<v Speaker 1>you have to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

259
00:12:09.911 --> 00:12:10.744
<v Speaker 1>that is the real problem with religion </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we all recognize that no one </v>

260
00:12:14.711 --> 00:12:18.460
<v Speaker 1>person has ultimate truth and especially</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're just going through this life</v>

261
00:12:18.461 --> 00:12:19.294
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure out yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure out what is this all </v>

262
00:12:21.431 --> 00:12:22.264
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this strange spinning ball that's </v>

263
00:12:23.981 --> 00:12:28.000
<v Speaker 1>floating in the sky and were hurling </v>
<v Speaker 1>through infinity and what is the purpose</v>

264
00:12:28.001 --> 00:12:28.834
<v Speaker 1>of this existence?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of open ended </v>

265
00:12:30.581 --> 00:12:31.414
<v Speaker 1>questions that never have any answers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when someone comes along and they </v>

266
00:12:34.991 --> 00:12:38.860
<v Speaker 1>have this rigid ideology where things </v>
<v Speaker 1>are very clearly defined,</v>

267
00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:42.310
<v Speaker 1>you must ask who is defining these </v>
<v Speaker 1>things?</v>

268
00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:43.233
<v Speaker 1>Who is this person that is beyond </v>
<v Speaker 1>reproach and when that person is a </v>

269
00:12:46.451 --> 00:12:47.284
<v Speaker 1>yellow tooth weirdo that's dressed like </v>
<v Speaker 1>a captain with some medals that he put </v>

270
00:12:51.281 --> 00:12:52.114
<v Speaker 1>himself on his own jacket and he's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>science fiction author who wrote more </v>

271
00:12:57.071 --> 00:13:00.280
<v Speaker 1>bullshit than any human beings ever and </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote bad books.</v>

272
00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:01.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a bad writer.</v>

273
00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:04.060
<v Speaker 1>I've only,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't read any of it.</v>

274
00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.690
<v Speaker 1>I've read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've tried to read dianetics uh,</v>

275
00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:10.150
<v Speaker 1>several times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost unreadable in my view.</v>

276
00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:11.133
<v Speaker 1>Have you tried to make Diana bought </v>
<v Speaker 1>dianetics once a late night before the </v>

277
00:13:14.621 --> 00:13:17.050
<v Speaker 1>Internet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a late night infomercial.</v>

278
00:13:17.051 --> 00:13:17.884
<v Speaker 1>I've always been a person who's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a self help and psychology because I </v>

279
00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:23.023
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always tried to figure out like </v>

280
00:13:24.191 --> 00:13:28.120
<v Speaker 1>what is it about why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do people sabotage themselves,</v>

281
00:13:28.121 --> 00:13:31.990
<v Speaker 1>why do I get lazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do I not fulfill some of my goals?</v>

282
00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:33.093
<v Speaker 1>And so I really got into like Anthony </v>
<v Speaker 1>Robbins and I got into a lot of </v>

283
00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:36.333
<v Speaker 1>psychology books and self help books and</v>
<v Speaker 1>one night I was at home and I was </v>

284
00:13:39.941 --> 00:13:42.220
<v Speaker 1>watching this commercial for dianetics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I said,</v>

285
00:13:42.221 --> 00:13:43.450
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to call this.</v>

286
00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:47.110
<v Speaker 1>And I called and I guess I gave my </v>
<v Speaker 1>credit card number or whatever it was.</v>

287
00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:50.080
<v Speaker 1>And this is while you were an actor at </v>
<v Speaker 1>this point?</v>

288
00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:51.940
<v Speaker 1>I was working at quite successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

289
00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:53.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean they wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

290
00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:55.120
<v Speaker 1>If they saw you coming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would have.</v>

291
00:13:55.121 --> 00:13:57.670
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would have made their year.</v>

292
00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:58.810
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never went in.</v>

293
00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:01.060
<v Speaker 1>I've never went there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I did in the future.</v>

294
00:14:01.061 --> 00:14:03.280
<v Speaker 1>I did do the meter thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that was way later.</v>

295
00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:04.233
<v Speaker 1>So this is like 1994 when I first came </v>
<v Speaker 1>to Hollywood and I was alone in my </v>

296
00:14:08.231 --> 00:14:09.064
<v Speaker 1>apartment in north Hollywood pop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably lonely trying to figure things </v>

297
00:14:11.621 --> 00:14:14.140
<v Speaker 1>out and just got here by buy this </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking thing.</v>

298
00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:15.333
<v Speaker 1>Those people sent me pamphlets and </v>
<v Speaker 1>paperwork and an invitation to seminars </v>

299
00:14:21.491 --> 00:14:24.220
<v Speaker 1>and this thing and that thing for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>decade.</v>

300
00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:26.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just never ended.</v>

301
00:14:26.111 --> 00:14:28.540
<v Speaker 1>It was like weekly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>monthly,</v>

302
00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:29.930
<v Speaker 1>constant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This.</v>

303
00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:32.680
<v Speaker 1>They're very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very relentless in their pursuit.</v>

304
00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:35.560
<v Speaker 1>And if you looked at what their </v>
<v Speaker 1>pamphlets were saying,</v>

305
00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:39.040
<v Speaker 1>it was all really reasonable enticing </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

306
00:14:39.041 --> 00:14:42.730
<v Speaker 1>It was all about improving yourself is </v>
<v Speaker 1>all about fulfilling your goals,</v>

307
00:14:42.731 --> 00:14:43.564
<v Speaker 1>eliminating negative thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eliminated other people's negative </v>

308
00:14:45.941 --> 00:14:48.160
<v Speaker 1>thoughts that are influencing the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>you view your life.</v>

309
00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:50.170
<v Speaker 1>Eliminating the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

310
00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:51.163
<v Speaker 1>effect of past experiences that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative and that may have defined you </v>

311
00:14:54.621 --> 00:14:55.454
<v Speaker 1>in some way.</v>

312
00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:56.443
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of that.</v>

313
00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:59.770
<v Speaker 2>But that's basically Freud basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

314
00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:01.273
<v Speaker 2>It's Freud with a lie detector hooked up</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a lie detector that in essence is </v>

315
00:15:06.301 --> 00:15:08.940
<v Speaker 2>auditing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is when you read dianetics,</v>

316
00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:12.370
<v Speaker 2>you realize how loopy it is in my view </v>
<v Speaker 2>at.</v>

317
00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:13.520
<v Speaker 2>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

318
00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:15.000
<v Speaker 2>because some times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

319
00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:15.843
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I praise this sort of skeptical minded </v>

320
00:15:17.581 --> 00:15:19.200
<v Speaker 2>approach where people say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

321
00:15:19.201 --> 00:15:20.790
<v Speaker 2>what's your problem with scientology?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

322
00:15:20.791 --> 00:15:23.190
<v Speaker 2>all religions are Kooky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the fact is,</v>

323
00:15:23.191 --> 00:15:27.570
<v Speaker 2>is just exhibit a is just read dianetics</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you read the Bible,</v>

324
00:15:27.571 --> 00:15:28.404
<v Speaker 2>it's got loony stuff in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's got passages of transcendent </v>

325
00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:32.003
<v Speaker 2>poetry and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just parables that you could </v>

326
00:15:33.961 --> 00:15:36.510
<v Speaker 2>meditate on and a beautifully written </v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

327
00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:38.750
<v Speaker 2>in the translated English,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

328
00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:40.073
<v Speaker 2>you read dianetics and it's just </v>
<v Speaker 2>childish stuff about literally things </v>

329
00:15:44.101 --> 00:15:45.000
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

330
00:15:45.001 --> 00:15:49.200
<v Speaker 2>a lot of your problems may be because </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you were in Utero as a fetus,</v>

331
00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:51.660
<v Speaker 2>your father try to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

332
00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:52.620
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bought you,</v>

333
00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:55.240
<v Speaker 2>your father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tried to abort the fetus are,</v>

334
00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:58.500
<v Speaker 2>and you can still remember that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's holding you back.</v>

335
00:15:58.501 --> 00:15:59.334
<v Speaker 2>And at the same time a record was </v>
<v Speaker 2>playing and every time you hear that </v>

336
00:16:02.131 --> 00:16:02.964
<v Speaker 2>record,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of this sort of Pavlov mixed </v>

337
00:16:05.221 --> 00:16:09.570
<v Speaker 2>with really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm totally unscientific ideas.</v>

338
00:16:10.090 --> 00:16:13.200
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it expands to past lives.</v>

339
00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:17.190
<v Speaker 2>So it's traumas or bad memories from </v>
<v Speaker 2>previous lifetimes.</v>

340
00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:19.290
<v Speaker 2>And at that point I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not on this ship.</v>

341
00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:23.210
<v Speaker 2>I was not a before but even more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

342
00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:24.400
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to be honest,</v>

343
00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:25.233
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's what we were saying earlier </v>

344
00:16:26.621 --> 00:16:27.454
<v Speaker 1>about rigid ideologies that rigid </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideologies are always problematic </v>

345
00:16:30.251 --> 00:16:34.180
<v Speaker 1>because there's so many open ended </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions when it comes to being a human</v>

346
00:16:34.181 --> 00:16:36.970
<v Speaker 1>being on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is a problem with religions.</v>

347
00:16:36.971 --> 00:16:37.804
<v Speaker 1>And that was one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>religions do by creating these rigid </v>

348
00:16:41.441 --> 00:16:42.274
<v Speaker 1>ideologies is they make things so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to question stuff and </v>

349
00:16:45.341 --> 00:16:46.174
<v Speaker 1>that gives some people comfort if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know that these are the rules and you </v>

350
00:16:48.851 --> 00:16:53.140
<v Speaker 1>don't have to think about why </v>
<v Speaker 1>homosexuality is bad or why,</v>

351
00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:55.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fill in the blank,</v>

352
00:16:55.061 --> 00:16:56.590
<v Speaker 1>whatever the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the issue is.</v>

353
00:16:57.490 --> 00:17:00.460
<v Speaker 1>When someone defines something like that</v>
<v Speaker 1>for you,</v>

354
00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:05.640
<v Speaker 1>it makes it so you have less questions </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you have comfort in these truths,</v>

355
00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:07.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>air quotes.</v>

356
00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:10.630
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not good for anybody.</v>

357
00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:11.583
<v Speaker 1>So it's bad for everyone involved </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there are some things that I </v>

358
00:17:15.701 --> 00:17:20.701
<v Speaker 1>think we've all learned a be nice to </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and it feels better to them.</v>

359
00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:21.873
<v Speaker 1>Feels better to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a healthier existence when you </v>

360
00:17:24.461 --> 00:17:25.294
<v Speaker 1>have harmony with your neighbors and </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you can create a good community of </v>

361
00:17:28.181 --> 00:17:30.670
<v Speaker 1>people that are being harmonious </v>
<v Speaker 1>together and friendly together.</v>

362
00:17:30.671 --> 00:17:32.440
<v Speaker 1>It's a really nice place to live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are pretty.</v>

363
00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:34.750
<v Speaker 1>That's a pretty much a universal truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

364
00:17:34.751 --> 00:17:35.584
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of those that exist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even those can be debated and </v>

365
00:17:38.351 --> 00:17:39.910
<v Speaker 1>discussed and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you find,</v>

366
00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:41.163
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wha various approaches to the end goal </v>

367
00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:45.850
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of happiness.</v>

368
00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:48.940
<v Speaker 1>Whenever you have someone who wrote</v>

369
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:51.143
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of Wacky Shit like this and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have seemingly intelligent people </v>

370
00:17:54.451 --> 00:17:55.284
<v Speaker 2>defending it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that woman that we were discussing </v>

371
00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:00.480
<v Speaker 2>when that woman was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she did not seem stupid at all.</v>

372
00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:02.653
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure she will reliably informed </v>

373
00:18:04.441 --> 00:18:05.274
<v Speaker 2>because in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the film we go off and meet her ex </v>

374
00:18:06.931 --> 00:18:07.764
<v Speaker 2>husband who's now no longer in </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientology and he describes her as a </v>

375
00:18:11.131 --> 00:18:12.840
<v Speaker 2>very sensitive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>caring person.</v>

376
00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:15.150
<v Speaker 2>A lot of the assertiveness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>

377
00:18:15.151 --> 00:18:16.200
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she shows,</v>

378
00:18:16.201 --> 00:18:20.380
<v Speaker 2>I think she probably acquired through a </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientology and and and,</v>

379
00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:21.233
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of scientology training in </v>
<v Speaker 2>terms of what it imparts to people is a </v>

380
00:18:25.541 --> 00:18:27.840
<v Speaker 2>quality of being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>direct,</v>

381
00:18:27.841 --> 00:18:29.460
<v Speaker 2>being assertive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being confident,</v>

382
00:18:29.461 --> 00:18:33.570
<v Speaker 2>being in charge and being okay with sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of dominating the situations that you're</v>

383
00:18:33.571 --> 00:18:34.404
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the reasons that I think it </v>

384
00:18:35.911 --> 00:18:38.700
<v Speaker 2>appeals a lot to actors because it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

385
00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:40.680
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it works.</v>

386
00:18:40.681 --> 00:18:41.514
<v Speaker 2>I think for people who have any sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>insecurity or who are going into </v>

387
00:18:43.591 --> 00:18:44.424
<v Speaker 2>situations of uncertainty and it allows </v>
<v Speaker 2>you to almost reprogramming your </v>

388
00:18:48.781 --> 00:18:53.781
<v Speaker 2>circuits in some way and be okay about </v>
<v Speaker 2>using assertive body language and speech</v>

389
00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:56.543
<v Speaker 2>and it also imparts a sense that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have all the traits necessary to save </v>

390
00:18:59.911 --> 00:19:01.200
<v Speaker 2>humanity from itself.</v>

391
00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:02.393
<v Speaker 2>Not just humanity on earth but </v>
<v Speaker 2>throughout a time and space and it is </v>

392
00:19:06.001 --> 00:19:09.480
<v Speaker 2>your obligation to ensure that those </v>
<v Speaker 2>truths are saved,</v>

393
00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:10.373
<v Speaker 2>saved for posterity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and communicated as widely as possible </v>

394
00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:14.063
<v Speaker 2>in a totally unadulterated fashion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because any adulteration of the message </v>

395
00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:22.440
<v Speaker 2>means that not only do they not work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they become toxic and dangerous.</v>

396
00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:23.693
<v Speaker 2>It seems to me that there's a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>things going on and that there's some </v>

397
00:19:27.781 --> 00:19:28.614
<v Speaker 2>aspects of it that maybe could be </v>
<v Speaker 2>beneficial that they could extract from </v>

398
00:19:32.311 --> 00:19:33.144
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Almost like these people that have </v>

399
00:19:34.651 --> 00:19:37.530
<v Speaker 2>abandoned scientology can start </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientology lights.</v>

400
00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:38.161
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do.</v>

401
00:19:38.161 --> 00:19:39.450
<v Speaker 2>They are doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are they?</v>

402
00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:40.373
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But one of the funny things is once you </v>

403
00:19:42.421 --> 00:19:43.254
<v Speaker 2>have scientology light,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's called the indie movement </v>

404
00:19:44.911 --> 00:19:45.744
<v Speaker 2>independent scientology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's often make an analogy is made </v>

405
00:19:48.451 --> 00:19:51.870
<v Speaker 2>with Martin Luther and protestantism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

406
00:19:51.871 --> 00:19:53.670
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

407
00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:54.651
<v Speaker 2>people said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

408
00:19:54.651 --> 00:19:55.484
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing in the Bible about the </v>

409
00:19:56.101 --> 00:19:56.760
<v Speaker 2>papacy.</v>

410
00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:57.593
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing about selling </v>

411
00:19:58.711 --> 00:20:02.100
<v Speaker 2>indulgences and having palaces in Rome </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the Vatican.</v>

412
00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:03.173
<v Speaker 2>So actually really there's just stuff in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Bible about following Jesus and </v>

413
00:20:08.011 --> 00:20:10.320
<v Speaker 2>reading the Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So shouldn't that be what we were doing?</v>

414
00:20:10.321 --> 00:20:12.090
<v Speaker 2>And so they go off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have protestantism.</v>

415
00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:15.000
<v Speaker 2>The trouble with the independent </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement is,</v>

416
00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:17.980
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it turns out that if you remove the,</v>

417
00:20:18.290 --> 00:20:22.560
<v Speaker 2>the raw predatory money raising side and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

418
00:20:22.561 --> 00:20:25.500
<v Speaker 2>and the sort of fundamentalist </v>
<v Speaker 2>controlling side,</v>

419
00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:26.693
<v Speaker 2>you get something a bit wishy washy </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's more or less indistinguishable </v>

420
00:20:29.881 --> 00:20:34.881
<v Speaker 2>from many other self help creates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it sort of loses its potency.</v>

421
00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:38.700
<v Speaker 2>It's almost that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the authoritarian dimension of,</v>

422
00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:40.000
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the,</v>

423
00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:40.893
<v Speaker 2>of scientology and the way in which your</v>
<v Speaker 2>demands total obedience from its </v>

424
00:20:43.651 --> 00:20:48.580
<v Speaker 2>followers is intrinsic to its ability to</v>
<v Speaker 2>have an effect that's fascinating.</v>

425
00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:49.973
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people do in some some way gravitate </v>

426
00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:57.190
<v Speaker 3>towards discipline and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you see that in the military,</v>

427
00:20:57.191 --> 00:20:58.340
<v Speaker 3>like the benefit of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

428
00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:00.080
<v Speaker 3>Yes sir.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No Sir.</v>

429
00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:02.560
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the things I talk about in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the film is,</v>

430
00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:05.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean we talked as well about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>appeal of scientology.</v>

431
00:21:05.321 --> 00:21:07.870
<v Speaker 2>Why do people defend it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it works for some people.</v>

432
00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:11.110
<v Speaker 2>I think there's an obvious thing if the </v>
<v Speaker 2>thin end of the wedge,</v>

433
00:21:11.111 --> 00:21:13.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get in knee deep and then you think,</v>

434
00:21:13.991 --> 00:21:16.840
<v Speaker 2>well I've come in this far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So even though I've got doubts,</v>

435
00:21:16.841 --> 00:21:17.674
<v Speaker 2>I got a little further.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you sort of reach a tipping </v>

436
00:21:19.361 --> 00:21:23.410
<v Speaker 2>point of commitment where it becomes </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost embarrassing to back out.</v>

437
00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:24.473
<v Speaker 2>You're sort of $100,000 or more in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>10 years in your family is annoyed with </v>

438
00:21:29.921 --> 00:21:30.431
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of them,</v>

439
00:21:30.431 --> 00:21:31.740
<v Speaker 2>you don't see you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you read this.</v>

440
00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:34.540
<v Speaker 2>It's very hard to walk away from that </v>
<v Speaker 2>commitment.</v>

441
00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:35.803
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's,</v>

442
00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:39.970
<v Speaker 2>there's all these powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really compelling reasons for why.</v>

443
00:21:39.971 --> 00:21:41.920
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other part of it is,</v>

444
00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:42.933
<v Speaker 2>and this is the part that I as an </v>
<v Speaker 2>outsider appreciate and I own up to in </v>

445
00:21:45.431 --> 00:21:49.060
<v Speaker 2>the film,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that there's something grandiose.</v>

446
00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:50.740
<v Speaker 2>It's a bit like trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

447
00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:56.170
<v Speaker 2>You see these gilded casinos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see these towering shiny buildings,</v>

448
00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:58.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they kind of over the top and grotesque,</v>

449
00:21:58.571 --> 00:22:01.030
<v Speaker 2>but they're also sort of majestic and </v>
<v Speaker 2>imperial.</v>

450
00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:03.670
<v Speaker 2>And if you ever watched scientology </v>
<v Speaker 2>footage,</v>

451
00:22:03.671 --> 00:22:04.504
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of it's on youtube and you see how </v>

452
00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:11.400
<v Speaker 2>they are very good at a certain kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm over the top aesthetic.</v>

453
00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:15.940
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Almost a kind of re Leni Riefenstahl ask</v>

454
00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:17.183
<v Speaker 2>'em with lights and flaming Brazier's </v>
<v Speaker 2>and thousands of people surging up with </v>

455
00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:24.790
<v Speaker 2>in unison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it has an effect,</v>

456
00:22:24.791 --> 00:22:25.481
<v Speaker 2>you sort of think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

457
00:22:25.481 --> 00:22:28.860
<v Speaker 2>these guys know how to run a show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you go into any org,</v>

458
00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:29.703
<v Speaker 2>have you been into an.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They call them all because when the </v>

459
00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:32.410
<v Speaker 2>organization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

460
00:22:32.411 --> 00:22:34.930
<v Speaker 2>so near where I'm staying in Los Felix,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's one,</v>

461
00:22:34.931 --> 00:22:35.764
<v Speaker 2>it's on Hillhurst I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you go in and it feels like you're </v>

462
00:22:38.711 --> 00:22:42.670
<v Speaker 2>kind of in a religious library,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorta,</v>

463
00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:45.760
<v Speaker 2>sorta designed by jp two man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

464
00:22:45.761 --> 00:22:46.594
<v Speaker 2>that like the catalog company and it had</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of old globes and kind of </v>

465
00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:53.860
<v Speaker 2>distressed wooden furniture and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and wicker chairs and it feels like it's</v>

466
00:22:53.861 --> 00:22:57.580
<v Speaker 2>kind of like slightly colonial golden </v>
<v Speaker 2>age of exploration feel.</v>

467
00:22:57.820 --> 00:22:59.860
<v Speaker 2>I know what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it feels very,</v>

468
00:22:59.861 --> 00:23:00.694
<v Speaker 2>it feels very sort of swept up in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>narrative of we're in a place where </v>

469
00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:05.650
<v Speaker 2>there's adventure and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

470
00:23:05.651 --> 00:23:06.460
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

471
00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:08.760
<v Speaker 2>and in a certain sense of order and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

472
00:23:08.761 --> 00:23:11.710
<v Speaker 2>and actually this sort of seductive </v>
<v Speaker 2>quality to it.</v>

473
00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:13.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a seductive quality to it.</v>

474
00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:13.770
<v Speaker 2>A lot of</v>

475
00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:14.850
<v Speaker 3>religions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

476
00:23:14.851 --> 00:23:15.684
<v Speaker 3>I find a seductive quality to people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are very confident in what they're </v>

477
00:23:18.181 --> 00:23:19.014
<v Speaker 3>saying and this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this ultimate truth that they're </v>

478
00:23:21.601 --> 00:23:23.250
<v Speaker 3>espousing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

479
00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:24.353
<v Speaker 3>I went to the Vatican recently and one </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the things that was really apparent </v>

480
00:23:28.381 --> 00:23:32.550
<v Speaker 3>to me was the sheer scale and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the vast,</v>

481
00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:38.780
<v Speaker 3>the size of St Peter's not Saint Peter's</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cathedral.</v>

482
00:23:39.391 --> 00:23:42.000
<v Speaker 3>It's a school pages,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

483
00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:43.531
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The basilica.</v>

484
00:23:43.531 --> 00:23:44.520
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

485
00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:46.130
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was just,</v>

486
00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:47.173
<v Speaker 3>to me the most amazing thing I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>I've ever seen as far as like a human </v>

487
00:23:49.911 --> 00:23:51.640
<v Speaker 3>creation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most amazing thing I've ever seen in</v>

488
00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:55.250
<v Speaker 3>my life other than cheech and eatsa </v>
<v Speaker 3>other than the Mayan Pyramids.</v>

489
00:23:55.670 --> 00:23:56.503
<v Speaker 3>I was just stunned by the amount of work</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the hundreds of years of work that </v>

490
00:24:01.131 --> 00:24:03.590
<v Speaker 3>had gone into creating that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when you're there,</v>

491
00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:04.753
<v Speaker 3>the overall scale of it is so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so immense that it makes you feel </v>

492
00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:11.600
<v Speaker 3>pure and it makes you feel small.</v>

493
00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:14.690
<v Speaker 3>It makes you feel insignificant in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>greater picture.</v>

494
00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:15.763
<v Speaker 3>And I think that that is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a big factor with a lot of </v>

495
00:24:18.351 --> 00:24:19.184
<v Speaker 3>religions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is to eliminate the power of the </v>

496
00:24:21.501 --> 00:24:26.501
<v Speaker 3>individual by making you feel diminished</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the sheer scale of what you're seeing</v>

497
00:24:27.501 --> 00:24:28.560
<v Speaker 3>and what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the,</v>

498
00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:30.020
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the hall that you're in.</v>

499
00:24:30.290 --> 00:24:32.330
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure that's intimidating,</v>

500
00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:33.350
<v Speaker 3>very much so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

501
00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:35.990
<v Speaker 3>and that's one other thing which,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

502
00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:37.040
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

503
00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:40.850
<v Speaker 3>last year on the slightly on the back of</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing the scientology program,</v>

504
00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:41.713
<v Speaker 3>I was trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was living in the UK and I was trying </v>

505
00:24:43.851 --> 00:24:44.684
<v Speaker 3>to get a program going about a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fundamentalist Islam or not even </v>

506
00:24:48.711 --> 00:24:51.800
<v Speaker 3>fundamentalist actually beyond where </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's extreme radical Islam,</v>

507
00:24:51.801 --> 00:24:52.670
<v Speaker 3>so cold,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

508
00:24:53.050 --> 00:24:53.883
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>basically people who support isis of </v>

509
00:24:55.161 --> 00:24:55.994
<v Speaker 3>which there are some in the UK,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although they're hard to interview </v>

510
00:24:58.611 --> 00:25:01.160
<v Speaker 3>because it's actually a crime to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

511
00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:03.650
<v Speaker 3>to glorify terrorism is what it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>called.</v>

512
00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:06.590
<v Speaker 3>And so they have to talk very gingerly </v>
<v Speaker 3>around the subject.</v>

513
00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:07.903
<v Speaker 3>But if you get into a debate about </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone who is sincerely committed to </v>

514
00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:15.500
<v Speaker 3>isis brand of Sunni Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

515
00:25:15.530 --> 00:25:16.730
<v Speaker 3>Where they're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually,</v>

516
00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:18.650
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sex slaves are okay.</v>

517
00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:19.880
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll say like,</v>

518
00:25:19.881 --> 00:25:22.700
<v Speaker 3>slaves isn't quite the right term,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we're approved that and blah,</v>

519
00:25:22.701 --> 00:25:23.480
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah.</v>

520
00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:24.950
<v Speaker 3>And then your throat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They say,</v>

521
00:25:24.951 --> 00:25:25.784
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by what authority do you challenge what </v>

522
00:25:27.591 --> 00:25:28.401
<v Speaker 3>we believe?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

523
00:25:28.401 --> 00:25:31.100
<v Speaker 3>When you start coming at them with some </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of humanistic,</v>

524
00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:34.820
<v Speaker 3>secular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>liberal sort of view of life and you try</v>

525
00:25:34.821 --> 00:25:35.241
<v Speaker 3>to explain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

526
00:25:35.241 --> 00:25:38.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm not basing my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have an authority as such,</v>

527
00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:39.381
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

528
00:25:39.381 --> 00:25:41.330
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not preaching a religion,</v>

529
00:25:41.331 --> 00:25:42.164
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

530
00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:44.090
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of better to be nice to </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

531
00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:46.370
<v Speaker 3>And they said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but based on what,</v>

532
00:25:46.371 --> 00:25:47.204
<v Speaker 3>under what authority that you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you find that you actually don't really </v>

533
00:25:49.821 --> 00:25:50.654
<v Speaker 3>have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's surprisingly difficult when you're </v>

534
00:25:52.311 --> 00:25:57.311
<v Speaker 3>thrown back on first principles to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>the case for um,</v>

535
00:25:57.710 --> 00:26:00.500
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of sensitive a secular way of doing</v>

536
00:26:00.501 --> 00:26:01.010
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

537
00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:02.640
<v Speaker 3>Does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

538
00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:04.333
<v Speaker 3>one of the appeals of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think whether it's scientology or </v>

539
00:26:06.501 --> 00:26:07.650
<v Speaker 3>Islam or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>

540
00:26:07.651 --> 00:26:08.960
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Christianity,</v>

541
00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:11.720
<v Speaker 3>Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever form that takes,</v>

542
00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:12.823
<v Speaker 3>they could say like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have all our answers there in a book </v>

543
00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:18.020
<v Speaker 3>and God told us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so who told you?</v>

544
00:26:18.021 --> 00:26:18.681
<v Speaker 3>And I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

545
00:26:18.681 --> 00:26:23.150
<v Speaker 3>no one told me I'm relying on two </v>
<v Speaker 3>millennia old tradition,</v>

546
00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:24.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>founded in,</v>

547
00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:25.880
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

548
00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:29.920
<v Speaker 3>Greco Roman times with various people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

549
00:26:30.170 --> 00:26:33.040
<v Speaker 3>in interpreters over the years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But actually I,</v>

550
00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:33.980
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

551
00:26:33.981 --> 00:26:36.560
<v Speaker 3>I can't really articulate that in 10 </v>
<v Speaker 3>words.</v>

552
00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:39.080
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's surprisingly hard.</v>

553
00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:42.680
<v Speaker 3>So once you're in the prison of a faith </v>
<v Speaker 3>based system,</v>

554
00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:45.390
<v Speaker 3>it's very hard to kind of leverage your </v>
<v Speaker 3>way out.</v>

555
00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:48.180
<v Speaker 3>I didn't do a good job of trying to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>them out basically.</v>

556
00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:50.700
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very difficult when they say that,</v>

557
00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:51.593
<v Speaker 3>like by what authority and you realize </v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have any and they think they </v>

558
00:26:54.421 --> 00:26:54.870
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

559
00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:56.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's where it gets weird.</v>

560
00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:57.463
<v Speaker 3>And like I don't have a book like </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever we call the other way of doing </v>

561
00:27:00.481 --> 00:27:01.350
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

562
00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:02.700
<v Speaker 3>And also you don't want to say like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

563
00:27:02.701 --> 00:27:03.870
<v Speaker 3>in western trip,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

564
00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:06.540
<v Speaker 3>you're trying not to because whether we </v>
<v Speaker 3>like it or not,</v>

565
00:27:06.541 --> 00:27:07.374
<v Speaker 3>all our beliefs have a um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some sort of geographic contemporarily </v>

566
00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:10.663
<v Speaker 3>specificity to them as much as we might </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to say that there are golden rules </v>

567
00:27:13.951 --> 00:27:17.130
<v Speaker 3>that exist through time and space.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there really are.</v>

568
00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:20.550
<v Speaker 3>These are all kind of constructed golf </v>
<v Speaker 3>culture.</v>

569
00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:21.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like old truths or culture.</v>

570
00:27:21.931 --> 00:27:24.180
<v Speaker 3>And so you're having to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

571
00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:25.043
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>over the last few hundred years since </v>

572
00:27:26.251 --> 00:27:27.660
<v Speaker 3>the enlightenment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

573
00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:31.950
<v Speaker 3>we've found that in general tortures not</v>
<v Speaker 3>a brilliant idea and capital punishments</v>

574
00:27:31.951 --> 00:27:35.340
<v Speaker 3>not great and slavery is largely </v>
<v Speaker 3>discredited and they,</v>

575
00:27:35.341 --> 00:27:35.851
<v Speaker 3>and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

576
00:27:35.851 --> 00:27:38.130
<v Speaker 3>so this is about the Western </v>
<v Speaker 3>enlightenment,</v>

577
00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:42.210
<v Speaker 3>that's your authority and I don't want </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be kinda basing it on that.</v>

578
00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:44.610
<v Speaker 3>So I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I slightly made a hash of it after,</v>

579
00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:46.530
<v Speaker 3>after I did the interview,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my producer said to me,</v>

580
00:27:46.531 --> 00:27:49.290
<v Speaker 3>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he kind of owned you in that.</v>

581
00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:53.300
<v Speaker 3>The guy who's like the isis defend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's now doing,</v>

582
00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:54.630
<v Speaker 3>he's doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's in prison now.</v>

583
00:27:54.810 --> 00:27:55.643
<v Speaker 3>That was why we didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the reasons we didn't finish the </v>

584
00:27:56.551 --> 00:27:59.070
<v Speaker 3>documentary anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's sort of going off on a tangent or</v>

585
00:27:59.110 --> 00:28:02.640
<v Speaker 3>would he go to prison for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for allegedly glorifying terrorism,</v>

586
00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:04.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you hear that twitter yesterday?</v>

587
00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:08.880
<v Speaker 3>Bam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two hundred and 35,000 twitter handles.</v>

588
00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:11.880
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really for promoting terrorism,</v>

589
00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:14.100
<v Speaker 3>really 230,</v>
<v Speaker 3>5,000.</v>

590
00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:16.750
<v Speaker 3>That's incredible how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

591
00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:21.660
<v Speaker 3>I'd be intrigued to know how they define</v>
<v Speaker 3>promoting terrorism as well as it.</v>

592
00:28:21.690 --> 00:28:23.720
<v Speaker 3>Would that all be Islamic or.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

593
00:28:24.130 --> 00:28:29.130
<v Speaker 3>or I would assume because I am not so </v>
<v Speaker 3>must've been that,</v>

594
00:28:30.650 --> 00:28:32.280
<v Speaker 3>but I wonder if they cause this.</v>

595
00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:33.113
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a conservative breitbart </v>

596
00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:36.330
<v Speaker 3>blogger who is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who has been Milo,</v>

597
00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:37.020
<v Speaker 3>Milo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Elena.</v>

598
00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:39.240
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was very sketchy.</v>

599
00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:41.820
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't agree with what he said,</v>

600
00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:42.713
<v Speaker 3>but if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you really pay attention to what he </v>

601
00:28:44.131 --> 00:28:45.690
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was very sketchy that they,</v>

602
00:28:45.770 --> 00:28:46.603
<v Speaker 3>they banned abandoned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you believe in freedom of </v>

603
00:28:48.571 --> 00:28:50.000
<v Speaker 3>speech or you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of.</v>

604
00:28:50.010 --> 00:28:51.180
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what he,</v>

605
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:52.290
<v Speaker 3>what he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all he did was,</v>

606
00:28:52.291 --> 00:28:53.124
<v Speaker 3>he made a post on Breitbart about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ghostbusters movie and it was very </v>

607
00:28:58.801 --> 00:28:59.634
<v Speaker 3>critical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even basically called it a piece of </v>

608
00:29:00.631 --> 00:29:01.990
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a terrible movie.</v>

609
00:29:01.991 --> 00:29:05.520
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is this ridiculous feminist film?</v>

610
00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:06.750
<v Speaker 3>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

611
00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:07.583
<v Speaker 3>creating this all female ghostbusters </v>
<v Speaker 3>cast were all the men are buffoons and </v>

612
00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:13.560
<v Speaker 3>no flame.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The African American actor,</v>

613
00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:14.423
<v Speaker 3>he flamed everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He called them fat and ugly and </v>

614
00:29:16.021 --> 00:29:18.090
<v Speaker 3>disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

615
00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:19.890
<v Speaker 3>what he's saying is essentially like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

616
00:29:19.891 --> 00:29:20.760
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm bitchy,</v>

617
00:29:21.390 --> 00:29:24.210
<v Speaker 3>bitchy all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a very flamboyantly gay guy.</v>

618
00:29:24.211 --> 00:29:26.250
<v Speaker 3>He's been in this podcast a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 3>times.</v>

619
00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:29.660
<v Speaker 3>He's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I find them funny on twitter,</v>

620
00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:30.513
<v Speaker 3>use it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

621
00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:34.830
<v Speaker 3>we used to go only abandoned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But here's what's interesting.</v>

622
00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:36.293
<v Speaker 3>He didn't do anything bad on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you look at what he said on </v>

623
00:29:38.821 --> 00:29:40.110
<v Speaker 3>twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like nothing,</v>

624
00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:41.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like nothing more than</v>

625
00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:43.473
<v Speaker 1>she had said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leslie Jones had said a bunch of things </v>

626
00:29:46.061 --> 00:29:51.061
<v Speaker 1>about him or what other people had said </v>
<v Speaker 1>about her.</v>

627
00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:55.900
<v Speaker 1>And she wrote something down that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>just poor grammar.</v>

628
00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:57.340
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he.</v>

629
00:29:57.341 --> 00:30:00.370
<v Speaker 1>And he wrote a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my word barely literate,</v>

630
00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:01.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>such a shame.</v>

631
00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:03.060
<v Speaker 1>Schools in America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

632
00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:05.170
<v Speaker 1>that's essentially what he wrote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he was banned.</v>

633
00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:07.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is really mild stuff.</v>

634
00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:08.313
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

635
00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:10.480
<v Speaker 1>I think what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a problem,</v>

636
00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:11.583
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he's conservative and they don't </v>

637
00:30:13.751 --> 00:30:14.584
<v Speaker 1>like that and that he does a attack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Feminists and social justice warriors </v>

638
00:30:20.171 --> 00:30:23.770
<v Speaker 1>and progressives and the left and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>goes after them.</v>

639
00:30:23.771 --> 00:30:26.860
<v Speaker 1>And that's essentially the whole base of</v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter.</v>

640
00:30:27.310 --> 00:30:29.680
<v Speaker 1>Twitter has this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do they call it again?</v>

641
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.430
<v Speaker 1>What is their counsel?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have</v>

642
00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:34.790
<v Speaker 3>strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very orwellian.</v>

643
00:30:34.791 --> 00:30:38.690
<v Speaker 3>It's like safety and trust and safety </v>
<v Speaker 3>council where things,</v>

644
00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:39.943
<v Speaker 3>a watchdog group within twitter that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well who decides what is and is not </v>

645
00:30:45.021 --> 00:30:49.820
<v Speaker 3>harassment and sorta.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's sorta like placating people who are</v>

646
00:30:49.821 --> 00:30:52.370
<v Speaker 3>recreationally outraged by other </v>
<v Speaker 3>people's opinions.</v>

647
00:30:52.910 --> 00:30:53.743
<v Speaker 3>The trouble is it's a public space that </v>
<v Speaker 3>is basically a opposed to a corporate </v>

648
00:30:56.511 --> 00:30:57.221
<v Speaker 3>entity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

649
00:30:57.221 --> 00:30:59.830
<v Speaker 3>So in essence they can do whatever they </v>
<v Speaker 3>want legally.</v>

650
00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:01.940
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's very ideologically based.</v>

651
00:31:01.941 --> 00:31:02.774
<v Speaker 3>It's very left wing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very weird and a lot of ways which </v>

652
00:31:04.911 --> 00:31:07.700
<v Speaker 3>I am in many ways leftwing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when I,</v>

653
00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:11.270
<v Speaker 3>when I read what they're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree in some ways,</v>

654
00:31:11.271 --> 00:31:12.104
<v Speaker 3>but outside of actual real harassment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't think that you should be </v>

655
00:31:17.271 --> 00:31:19.680
<v Speaker 3>able to just ban someone because they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

656
00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:22.130
<v Speaker 3>call someone a bitch or call someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>ugly.</v>

657
00:31:22.131 --> 00:31:23.900
<v Speaker 3>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't seem to me.</v>

658
00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:26.030
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to disagree with you.</v>

659
00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:28.040
<v Speaker 3>I mean I feel as though we're in a weird</v>
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>

660
00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:29.830
<v Speaker 3>We don't want to touch it slightly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

661
00:31:29.870 --> 00:31:34.040
<v Speaker 3>it was around the time of Charlie Hebdo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

662
00:31:34.041 --> 00:31:36.920
<v Speaker 3>which was everyone was marching for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>right to be offensive.</v>

663
00:31:36.921 --> 00:31:38.360
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And around the same time,</v>

664
00:31:38.390 --> 00:31:39.223
<v Speaker 3>trolling became a buzzword and it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea that we should stop trolling </v>

665
00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:42.973
<v Speaker 3>and there's a certain disconnect we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>living through as a culture to do with </v>

666
00:31:46.550 --> 00:31:48.500
<v Speaker 3>wanting to defend the right to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>offensive,</v>

667
00:31:48.501 --> 00:31:49.334
<v Speaker 3>but also come down hard on trawling and </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually at a certain point you can't </v>

668
00:31:52.281 --> 00:31:53.690
<v Speaker 3>have it both ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

669
00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:54.583
<v Speaker 3>Well there was also a lot of people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>were defending what had happened in </v>

670
00:31:58.701 --> 00:32:02.240
<v Speaker 3>Charlie Hebdo by saying that those </v>
<v Speaker 3>cartoons were really racist.</v>

671
00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:06.870
<v Speaker 3>They were going so far,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pro Islamic to sort of a bite.</v>

672
00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:08.080
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to say I.</v>

673
00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:08.953
<v Speaker 3>What I heard was because I understood </v>
<v Speaker 3>this was some people saying absolutely </v>

674
00:32:13.311 --> 00:32:13.820
<v Speaker 3>it's a crime.</v>

675
00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:16.480
<v Speaker 3>It's hideous and people have the right </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be um,</v>

676
00:32:17.150 --> 00:32:17.990
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

677
00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:18.913
<v Speaker 3>to be offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I'm not going to valorize the </v>

678
00:32:21.651 --> 00:32:22.484
<v Speaker 3>message or even hold these people up as </v>
<v Speaker 3>free speech monitors anymore than I </v>

679
00:32:26.931 --> 00:32:31.310
<v Speaker 3>would do if temet SCO or Neo Nazi was </v>
<v Speaker 3>killed.</v>

680
00:32:31.670 --> 00:32:35.420
<v Speaker 3>He does not thereby become a hero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He becomes a victim of a,</v>

681
00:32:35.421 --> 00:32:36.560
<v Speaker 3>of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a lynch mob,</v>

682
00:32:36.561 --> 00:32:37.394
<v Speaker 3>of a murderous campaign,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not there by a supporter of his </v>

683
00:32:42.771 --> 00:32:44.540
<v Speaker 3>output.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does that make sense?</v>

684
00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:45.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>

685
00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:47.600
<v Speaker 3>There's a mistake here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

686
00:32:47.601 --> 00:32:50.030
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to text that to Tom.</v>

687
00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:51.950
<v Speaker 3>Pablo thinks he's supposed to be here </v>
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>

688
00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:55.640
<v Speaker 3>Apparently he's outside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's supposed to be in next Monday.</v>

689
00:32:56.090 --> 00:32:57.260
<v Speaker 3>Lips.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tom?</v>

690
00:32:57.980 --> 00:32:59.090
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

691
00:32:59.091 --> 00:33:01.100
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Penn,</v>

692
00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:02.210
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the uh,</v>

693
00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:03.410
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was penn,</v>

694
00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:06.920
<v Speaker 3>the American magician,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no writers union.</v>

695
00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:09.520
<v Speaker 3>It was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a guild of writers.</v>

696
00:33:09.530 --> 00:33:11.870
<v Speaker 3>It supports the rights of writers around</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world in America.</v>

697
00:33:12.050 --> 00:33:12.441
<v Speaker 3>And they said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

698
00:33:12.441 --> 00:33:13.274
<v Speaker 3>we don't want to give an award.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there was a divide in the among </v>

699
00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:17.540
<v Speaker 3>parachute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which should we give an award to Charlie</v>

700
00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:20.160
<v Speaker 3>Hebdo by giving them an award,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

701
00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:25.440
<v Speaker 3>are you there by saying saying we </v>
<v Speaker 3>support you for saying that Mohammed was</v>

702
00:33:25.671 --> 00:33:27.140
<v Speaker 3>a piece of shit or whatever they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>

703
00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:28.820
<v Speaker 3>or are you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in other words,</v>

704
00:33:28.821 --> 00:33:31.250
<v Speaker 3>do you get an award for being killed?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does that.</v>

705
00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:35.120
<v Speaker 3>There's a little bit of a conflict there</v>
<v Speaker 3>in other words,</v>

706
00:33:35.121 --> 00:33:36.200
<v Speaker 3>so I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

707
00:33:36.201 --> 00:33:40.430
<v Speaker 3>I'm sympathetic to people who feel that </v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely was a crime was hideous.</v>

708
00:33:40.431 --> 00:33:43.100
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Islamofascism killed Charlie Hebdo,</v>

709
00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:46.120
<v Speaker 3>but that does not there by mate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Charlie Hebdo message.</v>

710
00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:48.650
<v Speaker 3>A loadable creditable one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

711
00:33:48.651 --> 00:33:49.484
<v Speaker 3>That's a really good point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because what were they doing and what </v>

712
00:33:51.501 --> 00:33:52.730
<v Speaker 3>was the point of what they were doing?</v>

713
00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:55.970
<v Speaker 3>Were they trust trying to be funny?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was it parody?</v>

714
00:33:56.330 --> 00:34:00.200
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it was funny because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't speak French and I haven't,</v>

715
00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:02.650
<v Speaker 3>I haven't really paid any attention to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the translations.</v>

716
00:34:02.670 --> 00:34:06.230
<v Speaker 3>Just to me it didn't seem that fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if joe,</v>

717
00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:07.810
<v Speaker 3>if Julia striker right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

718
00:34:07.811 --> 00:34:08.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

719
00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:09.713
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to compare them directly </v>

720
00:34:11.661 --> 00:34:12.381
<v Speaker 3>with this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

721
00:34:12.381 --> 00:34:15.450
<v Speaker 3>an offensive propagandists for the Nazis</v>
<v Speaker 3>just to take an exam.</v>

722
00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:16.453
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I shouldn't even go down this road </v>

723
00:34:16.881 --> 00:34:19.520
<v Speaker 3>because once you bring the Nazis ended,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just clouds everything.</v>

724
00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:24.550
<v Speaker 3>As soon as you say Hitler thought </v>
<v Speaker 3>blocking it blocks off,</v>

725
00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:26.390
<v Speaker 3>he's worse than Hitler.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's trump.</v>

726
00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:27.320
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

727
00:34:27.830 --> 00:34:28.880
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

728
00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:30.143
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the real bottom line is people were </v>

729
00:34:31.311 --> 00:34:33.380
<v Speaker 3>killed for cartoons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no way to defend that.</v>

730
00:34:33.381 --> 00:34:33.740
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

731
00:34:33.740 --> 00:34:35.190
<v Speaker 3>I think everyone agrees that we agree </v>
<v Speaker 3>with that.</v>

732
00:34:35.410 --> 00:34:37.020
<v Speaker 3>Does that make the cartoons good?</v>

733
00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:37.873
<v Speaker 3>It certainly doesn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They could be shit cartoons and people </v>

734
00:34:39.861 --> 00:34:42.100
<v Speaker 3>were killed for shit cartoons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's wrong to kill people.</v>

735
00:34:42.101 --> 00:34:44.210
<v Speaker 3>We show them cartoons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

736
00:34:44.211 --> 00:34:46.520
<v Speaker 3>the cartoons are still shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even l Ron Hubbard.</v>

737
00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:47.630
<v Speaker 3>Would you agree with that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

738
00:34:47.810 --> 00:34:49.880
<v Speaker 3>Hopefully.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

739
00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:51.103
<v Speaker 3>let's bring it back to scientology </v>
<v Speaker 3>because that's one of the interesting </v>

740
00:34:52.761 --> 00:34:53.594
<v Speaker 3>things about scientology is that anyone </v>
<v Speaker 3>who is a quote unquote opponent of </v>

741
00:34:57.351 --> 00:34:58.184
<v Speaker 3>Scientology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are allowed to violate pretty much </v>

742
00:34:59.991 --> 00:35:02.330
<v Speaker 3>all of their principals and just go </v>
<v Speaker 3>after you.</v>

743
00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:03.710
<v Speaker 3>You are the enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

744
00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:05.350
<v Speaker 3>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in you,</v>

745
00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:10.190
<v Speaker 3>there's a whole different set of rules </v>
<v Speaker 3>for engaging with someone who's an sp,</v>

746
00:35:11.970 --> 00:35:14.600
<v Speaker 3>like how they do that as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what they do in the military too,</v>

747
00:35:14.601 --> 00:35:16.160
<v Speaker 3>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

748
00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:17.203
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they abbreviate acronyms and a lot of </v>

749
00:35:19.131 --> 00:35:19.910
<v Speaker 3>stuff that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

750
00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:22.490
<v Speaker 3>in scientology is based on hubbards </v>
<v Speaker 3>naval experience.</v>

751
00:35:22.491 --> 00:35:23.324
<v Speaker 3>He loved,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they dress up in naval uniforms and </v>

752
00:35:25.671 --> 00:35:26.820
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he loved things like,</v>

753
00:35:27.590 --> 00:35:28.423
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>little bulletins or anything that felt </v>

754
00:35:30.621 --> 00:35:33.170
<v Speaker 3>kind of quasi military and you know what</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean?</v>

755
00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:38.580
<v Speaker 3>They love it in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a mixture of so military can enable</v>

756
00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:41.940
<v Speaker 3>stuff and then some corporate style </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

757
00:35:42.090 --> 00:35:42.923
<v Speaker 3>What it isn't is a lot of religious </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff like that is the one thing that </v>

758
00:35:45.361 --> 00:35:46.194
<v Speaker 3>you don't get a flavor of in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way they dress and drill this in </v>

759
00:35:49.071 --> 00:35:50.190
<v Speaker 3>show business,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

760
00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:53.640
<v Speaker 3>you've got a little touch of Hollywood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to touch of Navel.</v>

761
00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:56.580
<v Speaker 3>You don't have any sense of it being </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of spiritual,</v>

762
00:35:56.600 --> 00:36:00.240
<v Speaker 3>religious and I'm talking the way they </v>
<v Speaker 3>style themselves,</v>

763
00:36:00.241 --> 00:36:01.074
<v Speaker 3>the language they use,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're constantly using abbreviations </v>

764
00:36:03.631 --> 00:36:06.810
<v Speaker 3>that are more or less than </v>
<v Speaker 3>unintelligible to the outsider,</v>

765
00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:07.883
<v Speaker 3>which by the way is a lot of how </v>
<v Speaker 3>allegedly according to the experts on </v>

766
00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:15.480
<v Speaker 3>thought reform or colts so called,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they say,</v>

767
00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:16.343
<v Speaker 3>but by learning a new language,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's part of what kind of gets you </v>

768
00:36:18.511 --> 00:36:23.160
<v Speaker 3>caught up in thought patterns of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of an abusive system.</v>

769
00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:25.020
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's also military people.</v>

770
00:36:25.021 --> 00:36:25.854
<v Speaker 3>If you talked to people who really have </v>
<v Speaker 3>a deep understanding of the military or </v>

771
00:36:28.321 --> 00:36:31.830
<v Speaker 3>people who love the military,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they love to talk and those acronyms,</v>

772
00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:32.873
<v Speaker 3>they love to use them because it sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>lets everybody know that you're on the </v>

773
00:36:35.071 --> 00:36:36.030
<v Speaker 3>inside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

774
00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:38.580
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like when people talk about cars or</v>

775
00:36:38.581 --> 00:36:40.740
<v Speaker 3>anything where it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

776
00:36:40.770 --> 00:36:41.603
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a surface knowledge that most </v>

777
00:36:42.631 --> 00:36:43.441
<v Speaker 3>people have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

778
00:36:43.441 --> 00:36:44.850
<v Speaker 3>that is a Ferrari.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

779
00:36:44.851 --> 00:36:47.280
<v Speaker 3>that is a corvette.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then there's deep,</v>

780
00:36:47.281 --> 00:36:49.970
<v Speaker 3>deep knowledge as you start going into,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

781
00:36:50.050 --> 00:36:53.970
<v Speaker 3>the different types of gearing and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>axles and you know,</v>

782
00:36:53.971 --> 00:36:55.880
<v Speaker 3>it's got 4:11 rear end and this and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

783
00:36:55.881 --> 00:36:56.521
<v Speaker 3>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

784
00:36:56.521 --> 00:36:57.354
<v Speaker 3>he knows he's the deep knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has a deep knowledge of the car with </v>

785
00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:01.913
<v Speaker 3>the deep knowledge of the military.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of that is sort of expressed </v>

786
00:37:05.731 --> 00:37:06.810
<v Speaker 3>through acronyms.</v>

787
00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:08.520
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes they do.</v>

788
00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:10.330
<v Speaker 3>They do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they do stuff.</v>

789
00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:13.230
<v Speaker 3>So that's a big part of how they </v>
<v Speaker 3>operate.</v>

790
00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:14.093
<v Speaker 3>And I think as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is something I mentioned </v>

791
00:37:16.411 --> 00:37:17.244
<v Speaker 3>before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is important to bear in mind as well </v>

792
00:37:18.901 --> 00:37:19.734
<v Speaker 3>that as much as I'm scientology kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>costs the world and us and them terms </v>

793
00:37:25.350 --> 00:37:26.183
<v Speaker 3>which is very characteristic of a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>systems of thought that are inimical to </v>

794
00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:33.000
<v Speaker 3>sort of freedom or free way of thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's us and them.</v>

795
00:37:33.001 --> 00:37:35.910
<v Speaker 3>It's like Bush saying you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're either with us or against us.</v>

796
00:37:35.911 --> 00:37:36.744
<v Speaker 3>And in Scientology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a famous statement of Tom Cruise's </v>

797
00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:39.293
<v Speaker 3>that he gave in 2004 when he was given a</v>
<v Speaker 3>Freedom Medal of valor at a big </v>

798
00:37:41.911 --> 00:37:46.230
<v Speaker 3>scientology wold ceremony in England.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

799
00:37:46.231 --> 00:37:47.064
<v Speaker 3>you're either in or you're either </v>
<v Speaker 3>playing on the pitch or you're out of </v>

800
00:37:49.561 --> 00:37:51.500
<v Speaker 3>the arena.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

801
00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:55.640
<v Speaker 3>that's the one when they gave him that </v>
<v Speaker 3>huge flavor flave style.</v>

802
00:37:56.270 --> 00:37:58.230
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so his thing is like,</v>

803
00:37:58.231 --> 00:38:02.490
<v Speaker 3>you on the pitcher get out of the arena </v>
<v Speaker 3>because there's no half measures you get</v>

804
00:38:02.491 --> 00:38:04.530
<v Speaker 3>in or you're out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that whole idea,</v>

805
00:38:04.531 --> 00:38:05.364
<v Speaker 3>like if you're not part of the solution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you're part of the problem is a </v>

806
00:38:08.131 --> 00:38:10.200
<v Speaker 3>very dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>slippery road to go down.</v>

807
00:38:10.201 --> 00:38:11.034
<v Speaker 3>Because your then by definition saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's good guys and bad guys and if </v>

808
00:38:14.491 --> 00:38:16.170
<v Speaker 3>you're not on my team,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a bad guy.</v>

809
00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:18.120
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's define what the solution is,</v>

810
00:38:18.121 --> 00:38:19.560
<v Speaker 3>Tom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and sit down.</v>

811
00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:21.790
<v Speaker 3>Tell us about what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are thethe?</v>

812
00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:22.673
<v Speaker 3>Agent explained to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how Dayton's they throw them into a </v>

813
00:38:26.611 --> 00:38:27.750
<v Speaker 3>volcano.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happens?</v>

814
00:38:27.790 --> 00:38:28.340
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

815
00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:32.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to sound weird now because one</v>
<v Speaker 3>of my promises that I made to myself was</v>

816
00:38:32.371 --> 00:38:36.250
<v Speaker 3>that I would never gratuitously mark of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the beliefs</v>

817
00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:39.940
<v Speaker 2>of scientology and one of the things </v>
<v Speaker 2>they find offensive is,</v>

818
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:40.833
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is to reveal some of the secret truths </v>

819
00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:44.020
<v Speaker 2>that are unveiled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A.</v>

820
00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:45.910
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I take a step back,</v>

821
00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.090
<v Speaker 2>was unique to scientology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that it's a mystery religion,</v>

822
00:38:49.091 --> 00:38:49.924
<v Speaker 2>meaning that many of its beliefs around </v>
<v Speaker 2>veiled as you advance up the ladder of </v>

823
00:38:53.411 --> 00:38:56.180
<v Speaker 2>enlightenment and okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you don't have day one.</v>

824
00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:57.033
<v Speaker 2>Get told.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unlike with Jesus and Christianity on </v>

825
00:38:59.021 --> 00:38:59.854
<v Speaker 2>day one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're told he died on the cross for </v>

826
00:39:00.761 --> 00:39:03.430
<v Speaker 2>your sins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Believe in him and you will be saved and</v>

827
00:39:03.431 --> 00:39:04.264
<v Speaker 2>go to heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no kind of catch on later sort </v>

828
00:39:07.031 --> 00:39:09.610
<v Speaker 2>of amendment that gets made when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>a year,</v>

829
00:39:09.611 --> 00:39:10.444
<v Speaker 2>two years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three years down the line in </v>

830
00:39:11.921 --> 00:39:14.170
<v Speaker 2>Scientology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you learn more as you go up.</v>

831
00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:16.593
<v Speaker 2>Some say that that is partly something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that owes to Crowley or Alistair </v>

832
00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:20.680
<v Speaker 2>Crowley,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's pronounced,</v>

833
00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:21.853
<v Speaker 2>that Hubbard had practiced a form of </v>
<v Speaker 2>satanism when he was living in Pasadena </v>

834
00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:27.153
<v Speaker 2>in the forties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right after the Second World War and </v>

835
00:39:28.151 --> 00:39:29.620
<v Speaker 2>incorporated that aspect of it.</v>

836
00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:31.720
<v Speaker 2>And it is quite a seductive idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea,</v>

837
00:39:31.721 --> 00:39:32.554
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to learn more as I go on and </v>

838
00:39:33.610 --> 00:39:35.910
<v Speaker 2>kind of unraveling mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

839
00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:36.783
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that is part of scientology and when </v>

840
00:39:39.911 --> 00:39:42.070
<v Speaker 2>you get to own the ot levels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

841
00:39:42.071 --> 00:39:42.904
<v Speaker 2>once you've gone clear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is sort of half ot is operating </v>

842
00:39:46.361 --> 00:39:47.490
<v Speaker 2>fate and yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

843
00:39:47.850 --> 00:39:48.683
<v Speaker 2>so to begin with you're going clear is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was originally the best thing you could </v>

844
00:39:51.761 --> 00:39:54.130
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then subsequently there was,</v>

845
00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:54.983
<v Speaker 2>he added more levels and more layers and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get to the ot and this eight </v>

846
00:39:58.090 --> 00:40:03.090
<v Speaker 2>published ot levels and ot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three various secrets are revealed.</v>

847
00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:06.220
<v Speaker 2>And I'm allegedly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

848
00:40:06.250 --> 00:40:07.083
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if an uninitiated ot or an uninitiated </v>

849
00:40:09.911 --> 00:40:13.330
<v Speaker 2>person is shown the secrets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes them go crazy,</v>

850
00:40:13.690 --> 00:40:16.280
<v Speaker 2>but one of the things that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

851
00:40:16.281 --> 00:40:17.114
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not in a documentary about </v>

852
00:40:19.181 --> 00:40:21.570
<v Speaker 2>scientology rejoices in telling you </v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

853
00:40:21.590 --> 00:40:22.990
<v Speaker 2>what the ot stuff is.</v>

854
00:40:22.990 --> 00:40:24.880
<v Speaker 2>And I think you were about to touch on </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

855
00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:29.560
<v Speaker 2>I promised myself that I wouldn't reveal</v>
<v Speaker 2>them because I sort of felt,</v>

856
00:40:29.561 --> 00:40:30.394
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a little cheap when all these </v>

857
00:40:31.571 --> 00:40:33.460
<v Speaker 2>documentaries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

858
00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:34.211
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

859
00:40:34.211 --> 00:40:37.770
<v Speaker 2>this is what you $100,000 in or 200 or </v>
<v Speaker 2>500,000,</v>

860
00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:40.860
<v Speaker 2>you're going to learn what happens with </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] and then we,</v>

861
00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:42.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they spoil the surprise for everyone.</v>

862
00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:46.120
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I also felt like I'd like to be able</v>

863
00:40:46.121 --> 00:40:47.940
<v Speaker 2>to say to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I ever meet a scientology,</v>

864
00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:48.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure I've met some,</v>

865
00:40:48.991 --> 00:40:50.680
<v Speaker 2>but without knowing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

866
00:40:50.681 --> 00:40:53.260
<v Speaker 2>if I ever meet Tom Cruise or back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to be able to say like,</v>

867
00:40:53.261 --> 00:40:54.730
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't ever do anything.</v>

868
00:40:54.731 --> 00:40:55.564
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a right to know my truth and </v>

869
00:40:57.101 --> 00:40:59.350
<v Speaker 2>express my truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to mock you.</v>

870
00:40:59.351 --> 00:41:00.184
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to make you have a right to</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe what you want to believe and if </v>

871
00:41:02.201 --> 00:41:03.034
<v Speaker 2>you think you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no more than enforced the Jewish guy to </v>

872
00:41:04.421 --> 00:41:07.420
<v Speaker 2>eat pork or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or terrorist baronet to cut his hair.</v>

873
00:41:07.830 --> 00:41:10.850
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm not going to say to an ot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

874
00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:11.703
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what happens to ot three and it </v>

875
00:41:12.971 --> 00:41:15.250
<v Speaker 2>sounds like a bunch of junk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

876
00:41:15.251 --> 00:41:17.320
<v Speaker 2>you don't even have to say that's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of junk,</v>

877
00:41:17.350 --> 00:41:21.760
<v Speaker 2>but just expressing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's what we know.</v>

878
00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:22.833
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well we know about their doctrine or </v>

879
00:41:24.941 --> 00:41:26.650
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever you want to call it,</v>

880
00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:27.850
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their scripture.</v>

881
00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:32.440
<v Speaker 2>And there's an amazing moment in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>documentary,</v>

882
00:41:32.441 --> 00:41:34.090
<v Speaker 2>the hbo where it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was</v>

883
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:36.050
<v Speaker 3>Paul Higgs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that what gets Haggis?</v>

884
00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:37.790
<v Speaker 3>Haggis thank gets to ot three.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

885
00:41:37.791 --> 00:41:38.840
<v Speaker 3>you're going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fine.</v>

886
00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:43.220
<v Speaker 3>He gets to ot three and he starts </v>
<v Speaker 3>reading some of the handwritten stuff by</v>

887
00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:45.370
<v Speaker 3>l Ron Hubbard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a whole palava.</v>

888
00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:47.150
<v Speaker 3>It's an interesting bit in the book too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember?</v>

889
00:41:47.151 --> 00:41:47.984
<v Speaker 3>Like he's guided into a room and </v>
<v Speaker 3>literally it's almost like they take it </v>

890
00:41:50.961 --> 00:41:51.794
<v Speaker 3>out of a safety deposit box and kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>open it up with gloves of white gloved </v>

891
00:41:55.851 --> 00:41:56.684
<v Speaker 3>hands and then there's a hand written </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of piece of parchment inside </v>

892
00:41:59.991 --> 00:42:04.130
<v Speaker 3>written in Hubbard's manuscript and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>read it in that room and then.</v>

893
00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:05.053
<v Speaker 3>And then the guy has a little routine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He follows the person who brought you </v>

894
00:42:08.271 --> 00:42:08.961
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>comes in and says,</v>

895
00:42:08.961 --> 00:42:11.870
<v Speaker 3>has it been read and comprehended or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

896
00:42:12.290 --> 00:42:13.123
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you've read it and you go like </v>

897
00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:14.953
<v Speaker 3>a yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I ask and it shall be done or </v>

898
00:42:17.451 --> 00:42:18.860
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they put it back in and take it</v>

899
00:42:18.861 --> 00:42:19.580
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

900
00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:21.790
<v Speaker 3>Well it must be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a great sense of theater.</v>

901
00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:24.750
<v Speaker 3>Like I love.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like being in the Mason,</v>

902
00:42:24.751 --> 00:42:27.350
<v Speaker 3>so I mean all that secret squirrel </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

903
00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:28.910
<v Speaker 3>It's very appealing.</v>

904
00:42:34.420 --> 00:42:36.560
<v Speaker 3>I forgot about secret squirrel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

905
00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:42.710
<v Speaker 3>But I think it's important to talk about</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we know about what that is about.</v>

906
00:42:42.711 --> 00:42:45.500
<v Speaker 3>What is fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's on the Internet.</v>

907
00:42:46.370 --> 00:42:47.203
<v Speaker 3>What I would say is what they believe is</v>
<v Speaker 3>that man is an immortal in a mortal </v>

908
00:42:50.811 --> 00:42:54.380
<v Speaker 3>spirits and you have not you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are not your body.</v>

909
00:42:54.381 --> 00:42:56.900
<v Speaker 3>You are the spirit and the spirit is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>Fayton.</v>

910
00:42:56.930 --> 00:42:59.810
<v Speaker 3>That's the term they use for spirits and</v>
<v Speaker 3>your spirit.</v>

911
00:42:59.811 --> 00:43:02.180
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in essence have lived multiple lifetimes</v>

912
00:43:02.181 --> 00:43:04.760
<v Speaker 3>in multiple bodies going back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Millennia and going forward,</v>

913
00:43:04.761 --> 00:43:06.740
<v Speaker 3>Millennia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's not a unique thought.</v>

914
00:43:06.770 --> 00:43:07.970
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean unique to them.</v>

915
00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:09.560
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have that in Buddhism.</v>

916
00:43:09.561 --> 00:43:10.394
<v Speaker 3>But unlike in Buddhism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the transmigration of souls does not </v>

917
00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:16.670
<v Speaker 3>resides only in humans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

918
00:43:16.671 --> 00:43:18.300
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you can become a,</v>

919
00:43:18.530 --> 00:43:19.790
<v Speaker 3>a chipmunk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

920
00:43:19.791 --> 00:43:22.300
<v Speaker 3>Which you can in Buddhism I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can you not.</v>

921
00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:24.560
<v Speaker 3>You not know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think you know,</v>

922
00:43:24.590 --> 00:43:27.320
<v Speaker 3>depending on how you're calmer is nest </v>
<v Speaker 3>number one.</v>

923
00:43:27.321 --> 00:43:28.154
<v Speaker 3>And number two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is even more important or just as </v>

924
00:43:30.471 --> 00:43:31.304
<v Speaker 3>important,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that you can carry your memories </v>

925
00:43:32.601 --> 00:43:34.610
<v Speaker 3>through the lifetimes using a </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientology.</v>

926
00:43:34.611 --> 00:43:35.444
<v Speaker 3>And the gift that scientology gives you </v>
<v Speaker 3>is the ability to retain your memories </v>

927
00:43:39.951 --> 00:43:43.220
<v Speaker 3>and your identity across multiple </v>
<v Speaker 3>lifetimes.</v>

928
00:43:43.221 --> 00:43:46.310
<v Speaker 3>And that's why it's so important to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientologist to,</v>

929
00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:49.490
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to recollect his or her past lifetimes.</v>

930
00:43:49.491 --> 00:43:52.970
<v Speaker 3>Because it suggests that you're sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're on,</v>

931
00:43:52.971 --> 00:43:57.140
<v Speaker 3>you're now on your cosmic destiny and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you will carry it forward into your.</v>

932
00:43:57.141 --> 00:43:59.000
<v Speaker 3>When you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you next incarnate.</v>

933
00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:01.880
<v Speaker 3>These are all unique ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they're there,</v>

934
00:44:02.090 --> 00:44:02.923
<v Speaker 3>they're interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you know the source of all of </v>

935
00:44:06.021 --> 00:44:08.260
<v Speaker 3>it and yet they ignore it and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

936
00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:09.113
<v Speaker 3>they choose to not pay attention to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>other things that he read or wrote </v>

937
00:44:11.841 --> 00:44:14.150
<v Speaker 3>rather like a battlefield earth.</v>

938
00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:16.520
<v Speaker 3>That movie with John Travolta Grc that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>never saw.</v>

939
00:44:16.521 --> 00:44:18.080
<v Speaker 3>That one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's wonderful.</v>

940
00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:24.190
<v Speaker 3>It's wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's right up there with GRC showgirls.</v>

941
00:44:24.770 --> 00:44:26.090
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have seen showgirls.</v>

942
00:44:26.091 --> 00:44:26.924
<v Speaker 3>Showgirls is like a tour De Force of </v>
<v Speaker 3>writing a movie while you're high on </v>

943
00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:33.560
<v Speaker 3>cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hoven.</v>

944
00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:34.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Directed it.</v>

945
00:44:34.751 --> 00:44:35.584
<v Speaker 3>It's a great combination.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's in one of the best unintentional </v>

946
00:44:38.821 --> 00:44:41.270
<v Speaker 3>comedy that's ever been mined.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All you could.</v>

947
00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:45.450
<v Speaker 3>Hobans a brilliant director and I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>and starship troopers.</v>

948
00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:48.570
<v Speaker 3>He made and I'm the first Robo Cop he </v>
<v Speaker 3>knew.</v>

949
00:44:48.571 --> 00:44:49.404
<v Speaker 3>I think he knew what he was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he has a keen eye for camp and </v>

950
00:44:52.741 --> 00:44:55.530
<v Speaker 3>thought this is hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't you may ask the house?</v>

951
00:44:55.531 --> 00:44:57.270
<v Speaker 3>Maybe not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could have been,</v>

952
00:44:57.330 --> 00:44:58.440
<v Speaker 3>it could have been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

953
00:44:58.710 --> 00:45:02.550
<v Speaker 3>I think they were just coked out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>their mind and they made a wacky fucking</v>

954
00:45:02.551 --> 00:45:04.050
<v Speaker 3>movie and they probably thought it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>great,</v>

955
00:45:04.051 --> 00:45:05.080
<v Speaker 3>but fuck it.</v>

956
00:45:05.090 --> 00:45:06.720
<v Speaker 3>Print it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's go out.</v>

957
00:45:06.721 --> 00:45:09.030
<v Speaker 3>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's at the Ivy and I don't know,</v>

958
00:45:09.060 --> 00:45:09.893
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they were just out of their </v>

959
00:45:10.231 --> 00:45:10.800
<v Speaker 3>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

960
00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:13.560
<v Speaker 3>if you watch that film,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a scene where,</v>

961
00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:16.110
<v Speaker 3>what is her name?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Elizabeth Berkley.</v>

962
00:45:16.410 --> 00:45:18.440
<v Speaker 3>And the other guy from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

963
00:45:18.570 --> 00:45:21.750
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember who blue lagoon is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was from.</v>

964
00:45:22.110 --> 00:45:22.943
<v Speaker 3>Was He from?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was that TV show that he was on the </v>

965
00:45:24.350 --> 00:45:26.490
<v Speaker 3>handsome on Kyle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck's his name?</v>

966
00:45:27.170 --> 00:45:28.950
<v Speaker 3>Mcconnell lock.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of Caughlin.</v>

967
00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:30.413
<v Speaker 3>This is Kyle mclachlan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're having sex in a pool and she </v>

968
00:45:33.601 --> 00:45:37.530
<v Speaker 3>starts flopping around like a fish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She literally starts having spasms,</v>

969
00:45:37.531 --> 00:45:39.330
<v Speaker 3>like if you continued to have sex with </v>
<v Speaker 3>her,</v>

970
00:45:39.331 --> 00:45:40.164
<v Speaker 3>I feel like that's rape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this is a woman who is having a </v>

971
00:45:41.941 --> 00:45:44.250
<v Speaker 3>goddamn seizure and you're going to keep</v>
<v Speaker 3>having sex with her.</v>

972
00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:46.080
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever seen the scene?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

973
00:45:46.850 --> 00:45:47.400
<v Speaker 3>Seen the movie.</v>

974
00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:47.960
<v Speaker 3>So yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

975
00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:49.230
<v Speaker 3>it must have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's wonderful.</v>

976
00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:50.760
<v Speaker 3>She,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she starts,</v>

977
00:45:50.910 --> 00:45:51.743
<v Speaker 3>they're having sex and she starts </v>
<v Speaker 3>flailing like as if she's having a </v>

978
00:45:54.841 --> 00:45:55.674
<v Speaker 3>goddamn stroke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was in the middle of a heart attack </v>

979
00:45:57.391 --> 00:46:02.391
<v Speaker 3>or a seizure and that choice is the only</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing that haunts me about that movie.</v>

980
00:46:03.631 --> 00:46:05.490
<v Speaker 3>Like maybe it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe it was camp,</v>

981
00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:07.680
<v Speaker 3>maybe they're doing that on purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was,</v>

982
00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:10.500
<v Speaker 3>but I read an interview with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>director of,</v>

983
00:46:10.540 --> 00:46:12.090
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of battlefield,</v>

984
00:46:12.670 --> 00:46:15.150
<v Speaker 3>his battlefield,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he,</v>

985
00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:17.910
<v Speaker 3>he apparently is a pretty good director </v>
<v Speaker 3>and had,</v>

986
00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:22.110
<v Speaker 3>he's a European,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think maybe French and I think he just</v>

987
00:46:22.111 --> 00:46:26.040
<v Speaker 3>didn't know what he was walking into and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he didn't even,</v>

988
00:46:26.070 --> 00:46:28.770
<v Speaker 3>he didn't really check out what he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the Gig was.</v>

989
00:46:28.950 --> 00:46:32.280
<v Speaker 3>Well that was a product of John </v>
<v Speaker 3>Travolta.</v>

990
00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:37.920
<v Speaker 3>Travolta was labor and it's wonderfully </v>
<v Speaker 3>bad.</v>

991
00:46:38.070 --> 00:46:39.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a funny bit in,</v>

992
00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:44.420
<v Speaker 3>in going in the book where they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Cruz sees it and,</v>

993
00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:47.100
<v Speaker 3>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is so embarrassing for him.</v>

994
00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:50.520
<v Speaker 3>He's really upset about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

995
00:46:50.521 --> 00:46:55.521
<v Speaker 3>he was upset that they showed that video</v>
<v Speaker 3>of him saluting to Lrh.</v>

996
00:46:55.970 --> 00:46:58.770
<v Speaker 3>They salute when they got the metal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All that crazy shit.</v>

997
00:46:58.790 --> 00:46:59.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's all.</v>

998
00:46:59.870 --> 00:47:02.900
<v Speaker 3>It's all over youtube recruitment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was he upset about that being.</v>

999
00:47:03.330 --> 00:47:04.163
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they try to get that taken down and of </v>

1000
00:47:05.071 --> 00:47:08.860
<v Speaker 3>course it spread like wildfire through </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Internet because you just,</v>

1001
00:47:08.890 --> 00:47:11.740
<v Speaker 3>you just can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't take things like that down.</v>

1002
00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:13.080
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's classic.</v>

1003
00:47:13.081 --> 00:47:13.914
<v Speaker 3>Although a lot of stuff's been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are a lot of great scientology </v>

1004
00:47:15.841 --> 00:47:17.820
<v Speaker 3>videos that have been taken down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

1005
00:47:18.330 --> 00:47:20.340
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a famous one.</v>

1006
00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:22.073
<v Speaker 3>It's very hard to find.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the orientation video that was </v>

1007
00:47:25.021 --> 00:47:26.840
<v Speaker 3>shown to new parishioners.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1008
00:47:27.070 --> 00:47:30.160
<v Speaker 3>this is back in the eighties and it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>done by an infomercial pitch man</v>

1009
00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:33.080
<v Speaker 2>who was then a scientologist and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1010
00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:34.390
<v Speaker 2>subsequently left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1011
00:47:34.391 --> 00:47:35.350
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you know one of the,</v>

1012
00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:40.440
<v Speaker 2>they don't cost scientologists in </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientology a commercials.</v>

1013
00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:41.760
<v Speaker 2>Do you know why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

1014
00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:42.873
<v Speaker 2>Because they blow to off like they leave</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they no longer want to be in </v>

1015
00:47:46.211 --> 00:47:49.450
<v Speaker 2>the video or it becomes embarrassing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have someone speak.</v>

1016
00:47:49.451 --> 00:47:52.930
<v Speaker 2>Can you imagine if Leah Remini was in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>commercial for scientology?</v>

1017
00:47:52.931 --> 00:47:54.810
<v Speaker 2>They'd never be able to use it again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1018
00:47:55.270 --> 00:47:59.320
<v Speaker 2>So they call it sort of insurance </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they want to be able to use the,</v>

1019
00:47:59.380 --> 00:48:00.720
<v Speaker 2>they spent a lot of money on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>commercial.</v>

1020
00:48:00.730 --> 00:48:04.060
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to be embarrassed when </v>
<v Speaker 2>the scientologists who's The star of the</v>

1021
00:48:04.061 --> 00:48:06.910
<v Speaker 2>commercial leave scientology and says </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they were brainwashed.</v>

1022
00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:09.690
<v Speaker 1>That's their actual reason I'm told.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1023
00:48:09.750 --> 00:48:10.830
<v Speaker 1>How many of them left?</v>

1024
00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:13.160
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I mean say the retention rate.</v>

1025
00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:14.470
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're very,</v>

1026
00:48:14.530 --> 00:48:16.750
<v Speaker 2>they keep the data very close to their </v>
<v Speaker 2>chest.</v>

1027
00:48:16.751 --> 00:48:20.440
<v Speaker 2>So I know that they have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1028
00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:24.460
<v Speaker 2>they say millions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they say $40,</v>

1029
00:48:24.461 --> 00:48:28.150
<v Speaker 2>million and some vast amount worldwide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that in,</v>

1030
00:48:28.830 --> 00:48:31.000
<v Speaker 2>on Tony Ortega's blog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

1031
00:48:31.290 --> 00:48:34.470
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a US census data that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the,</v>

1032
00:48:34.540 --> 00:48:37.900
<v Speaker 2>that perhaps suggesting in the US it </v>
<v Speaker 2>might be 20 or $30,000.</v>

1033
00:48:37.901 --> 00:48:39.400
<v Speaker 2>We should probably get that fact </v>
<v Speaker 2>checked.</v>

1034
00:48:40.090 --> 00:48:44.160
<v Speaker 2>But I believe I read that there are more</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who identify as Jed,</v>

1035
00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:44.780
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1036
00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:45.613
<v Speaker 1>that's their religion and they're all </v>
<v Speaker 1>just decided a long process to become a </v>

1037
00:48:52.971 --> 00:48:53.840
<v Speaker 1>jetta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or can you just,</v>

1038
00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:55.173
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>climate.</v>

1039
00:48:55.350 --> 00:48:57.860
<v Speaker 1>I think this is a long process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's very cheap.</v>

1040
00:48:57.861 --> 00:48:58.880
<v Speaker 1>It's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1041
00:48:58.940 --> 00:49:01.310
<v Speaker 1>well I've watched all the movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm in.</v>

1042
00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:03.360
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

1043
00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:08.740
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing to me that this exists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand that it exists.</v>

1044
00:49:09.291 --> 00:49:12.650
<v Speaker 1>I intellectually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I sit back and I look at the,</v>

1045
00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:13.280
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1046
00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:15.860
<v Speaker 1>the many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many different religions and many,</v>

1047
00:49:15.861 --> 00:49:19.360
<v Speaker 1>many different ideologies that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>subscribe to in the,</v>

1048
00:49:19.470 --> 00:49:20.303
<v Speaker 1>the vast amount of people out there that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are searching for truth and an answer </v>

1049
00:49:23.001 --> 00:49:26.780
<v Speaker 1>and end something to belong to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even that,</v>

1050
00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:30.350
<v Speaker 1>even though all those things make sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>to me intellectually,</v>

1051
00:49:30.770 --> 00:49:31.603
<v Speaker 1>I'm still fascinated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still so puzzled that in 2016 with </v>

1052
00:49:35.571 --> 00:49:36.404
<v Speaker 1>the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with all the access to information that </v>

1053
00:49:38.421 --> 00:49:40.490
<v Speaker 1>we have today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that still exists.</v>

1054
00:49:40.830 --> 00:49:44.300
<v Speaker 2>It's a [inaudible] and you look forward </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you wonder,</v>

1055
00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:48.360
<v Speaker 2>it will you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this going to fizzle out?</v>

1056
00:49:48.540 --> 00:49:53.520
<v Speaker 2>But I think what they've done is they've</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of created a,</v>

1057
00:49:53.521 --> 00:49:54.354
<v Speaker 2>a marketing juggernaut that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if not immune to but at least highly </v>

1058
00:49:59.461 --> 00:50:03.030
<v Speaker 2>resistant to any attempt to discredit or</v>
<v Speaker 2>undermine.</v>

1059
00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:04.650
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read a thing that said,</v>

1060
00:50:04.651 --> 00:50:07.050
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's religion that sells secrets,</v>

1061
00:50:07.051 --> 00:50:08.640
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's its USP.</v>

1062
00:50:09.210 --> 00:50:10.043
<v Speaker 2>You advance something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you pay more money to get the more </v>

1063
00:50:13.171 --> 00:50:14.004
<v Speaker 2>secret levels and the Internet is </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kryptonite to that because the internet </v>

1064
00:50:18.661 --> 00:50:19.494
<v Speaker 2>is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a,</v>

1065
00:50:19.550 --> 00:50:21.870
<v Speaker 2>is a machine revealing secrets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1066
00:50:21.871 --> 00:50:24.480
<v Speaker 2>Wiki leaks and whatnot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can google anything.</v>

1067
00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:25.513
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that will be scientology's waterloo </v>

1068
00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:31.520
<v Speaker 2>will be the fact that we now have </v>
<v Speaker 2>searchable data.</v>

1069
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:32.711
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

1070
00:50:32.711 --> 00:50:35.900
<v Speaker 2>it shows no signs of coming apart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1071
00:50:35.901 --> 00:50:40.670
<v Speaker 2>that the numbers may not be high,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the amounts of revenue coming in and</v>

1072
00:50:40.730 --> 00:50:41.563
<v Speaker 2>are a huge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from what I can tell and I get the </v>

1073
00:50:44.181 --> 00:50:47.630
<v Speaker 2>feeling that um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you just have to see how,</v>

1074
00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:50.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the amount that they're able to spend on</v>

1075
00:50:50.421 --> 00:50:52.910
<v Speaker 2>advertising,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the number of new buildings that go up,</v>

1076
00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:55.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so however small it may be,</v>

1077
00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:56.350
<v Speaker 2>it has a huge.</v>

1078
00:50:56.350 --> 00:50:58.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm punching power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where are they getting the money from?</v>

1079
00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:00.193
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an interesting point are the first </v>

1080
00:51:02.001 --> 00:51:02.834
<v Speaker 2>thing is that it's it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's structured almost like a </v>

1081
00:51:05.150 --> 00:51:06.620
<v Speaker 2>Mcdonald's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1082
00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:08.930
<v Speaker 2>and in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>interestingly in 1950,</v>

1083
00:51:08.931 --> 00:51:09.764
<v Speaker 2>the year that dianetics was published </v>
<v Speaker 2>was also the first year that Mcdonald's </v>

1084
00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:13.693
<v Speaker 2>was established as pointed out by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you've ever read Janet </v>

1085
00:51:15.650 --> 00:51:16.483
<v Speaker 2>Reitman's book inside Scientology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It came up a year before Larry writes </v>

1086
00:51:19.131 --> 00:51:21.260
<v Speaker 2>book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going clear,</v>

1087
00:51:21.261 --> 00:51:22.610
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it was slightly,</v>

1088
00:51:22.611 --> 00:51:23.710
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's done.</v>

1089
00:51:23.711 --> 00:51:24.544
<v Speaker 2>That was stolen by going clear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's also an excellent book and a </v>

1090
00:51:27.141 --> 00:51:28.850
<v Speaker 2>great primary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you enjoyed going clear.</v>

1091
00:51:28.851 --> 00:51:30.860
<v Speaker 2>I really highly recommend inside </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientology.</v>

1092
00:51:30.890 --> 00:51:31.723
<v Speaker 2>She points this out that in 1950 </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mcdonald's was invented and so was </v>

1093
00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:37.520
<v Speaker 2>dianetics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1094
00:51:37.550 --> 00:51:42.550
<v Speaker 2>so they basically kind of a franchise </v>
<v Speaker 2>system in which they are sort of selling</v>

1095
00:51:42.741 --> 00:51:44.320
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they own the property of the,</v>

1096
00:51:44.340 --> 00:51:48.830
<v Speaker 2>of the various buildings in which </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientology is sold.</v>

1097
00:51:49.010 --> 00:51:52.430
<v Speaker 2>And then they licensed the materials but</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can't really,</v>

1098
00:51:52.460 --> 00:51:54.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the franchisees can lose money,</v>

1099
00:51:54.471 --> 00:51:58.640
<v Speaker 2>but scientology itself can't really lose</v>
<v Speaker 2>money because they're just getting rents</v>

1100
00:51:58.641 --> 00:52:01.250
<v Speaker 2>from the people who are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are selling the scientology.</v>

1101
00:52:01.251 --> 00:52:02.630
<v Speaker 2>Does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The services.</v>

1102
00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:06.430
<v Speaker 2>But it doesn't make sense that they get </v>
<v Speaker 2>that much revenue from that.</v>

1103
00:52:07.210 --> 00:52:08.840
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take real estate holders.</v>

1104
00:52:09.060 --> 00:52:10.280
<v Speaker 2>So they have huge amounts of real </v>
<v Speaker 2>estate.</v>

1105
00:52:10.281 --> 00:52:13.430
<v Speaker 2>The other part of it is that they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's a religion,</v>

1106
00:52:13.460 --> 00:52:16.610
<v Speaker 2>the money is a tax deductible or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

1107
00:52:16.611 --> 00:52:18.500
<v Speaker 2>like they don't pay taxes on it in </v>
<v Speaker 2>essence.</v>

1108
00:52:18.501 --> 00:52:19.334
<v Speaker 2>And so I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that means that it's very hard </v>

1109
00:52:21.411 --> 00:52:23.120
<v Speaker 2>for them to lose money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a huge,</v>

1110
00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:26.120
<v Speaker 2>it's a huge cushion against financial </v>
<v Speaker 2>failure.</v>

1111
00:52:26.360 --> 00:52:29.270
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was a really disturbing part of the</v>

1112
00:52:29.271 --> 00:52:30.104
<v Speaker 2>documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It showed how they became a tax exempt </v>

1113
00:52:32.001 --> 00:52:32.801
<v Speaker 2>religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

1114
00:52:32.801 --> 00:52:33.634
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the government essentially caved under </v>

1115
00:52:34.851 --> 00:52:36.980
<v Speaker 2>the threat of massive amounts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>lawsuits.</v>

1116
00:52:37.010 --> 00:52:37.611
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1117
00:52:37.611 --> 00:52:38.630
<v Speaker 2>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1118
00:52:39.770 --> 00:52:40.603
<v Speaker 2>basically the scientologists found a way</v>
<v Speaker 2>to pressure individual irs employees to </v>

1119
00:52:44.961 --> 00:52:48.290
<v Speaker 2>the point where their lives have become </v>
<v Speaker 2>extremely hard so they,</v>

1120
00:52:48.410 --> 00:52:50.430
<v Speaker 2>they'd settled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what year was that?</v>

1121
00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:54.650
<v Speaker 2>When I want to say I'm going to get this</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1122
00:52:54.710 --> 00:52:56.800
<v Speaker 2>Ninety two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say 92,</v>

1123
00:52:57.030 --> 00:52:59.240
<v Speaker 2>93.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing that that's upheld.</v>

1124
00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:01.760
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then again,</v>

1125
00:53:02.010 --> 00:53:03.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1126
00:53:04.170 --> 00:53:08.540
<v Speaker 2>what the benchmark for being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for having charitable status is not that</v>

1127
00:53:08.541 --> 00:53:09.374
<v Speaker 2>high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at the Clinton Foundation right </v>

1128
00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:12.103
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are the people scrutinizing what </v>

1129
00:53:15.081 --> 00:53:18.650
<v Speaker 2>qualifies as a charitable enterprise do </v>
<v Speaker 2>not seem to be.</v>

1130
00:53:18.890 --> 00:53:23.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm working,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially you on top of their game.</v>

1131
00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:28.680
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>

1132
00:53:28.681 --> 00:53:31.500
<v Speaker 2>I think once that's in place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the other part of it is,</v>

1133
00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:33.960
<v Speaker 2>so you paid one of their routes for </v>
<v Speaker 2>finances,</v>

1134
00:53:34.260 --> 00:53:35.790
<v Speaker 2>you pay for services,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you turn up,</v>

1135
00:53:35.791 --> 00:53:37.320
<v Speaker 2>you spent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want auditing,</v>

1136
00:53:37.321 --> 00:53:41.040
<v Speaker 2>so I'll get an order package for $300 </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you get whatever,</v>

1137
00:53:41.041 --> 00:53:41.880
<v Speaker 2>five sessions.</v>

1138
00:53:42.270 --> 00:53:43.103
<v Speaker 2>But the other thing is they solicit </v>
<v Speaker 2>donations and five or six times a year </v>

1139
00:53:46.170 --> 00:53:48.360
<v Speaker 2>they have large events.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1140
00:53:48.390 --> 00:53:51.030
<v Speaker 2>that's the footage of Tom Cruise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it one of these events?</v>

1141
00:53:51.031 --> 00:53:51.864
<v Speaker 2>And they cut their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like these huge Hollywood style award </v>

1142
00:53:54.151 --> 00:53:54.984
<v Speaker 2>ceremonies where they pack hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Scientology's into an auditorium and </v>

1143
00:53:58.651 --> 00:53:59.484
<v Speaker 2>they both looked quite impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to the outside they look kind of </v>

1144
00:54:02.671 --> 00:54:03.504
<v Speaker 2>grandiose and impressive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they are in essence a kind of live </v>

1145
00:54:06.421 --> 00:54:11.421
<v Speaker 2>infomercial event where everyone who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>there is then aggressively reged,</v>

1146
00:54:12.810 --> 00:54:16.500
<v Speaker 2>which means that they're aggressively </v>
<v Speaker 2>hit up for donations.</v>

1147
00:54:16.740 --> 00:54:20.010
<v Speaker 2>Does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anytime you see one of those events,</v>

1148
00:54:20.011 --> 00:54:23.070
<v Speaker 2>all those people who were at the event </v>
<v Speaker 2>before they can leave,</v>

1149
00:54:23.340 --> 00:54:26.340
<v Speaker 2>someone comes up to them and says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how committed to sign Tom Gru,</v>

1150
00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:31.350
<v Speaker 2>we would sincerely appreciate an </v>
<v Speaker 2>expression of your with your support and</v>

1151
00:54:31.351 --> 00:54:33.240
<v Speaker 2>the guilt tripped into making a </v>
<v Speaker 2>donation,</v>

1152
00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:34.890
<v Speaker 2>a tax deductible donation.</v>

1153
00:54:35.220 --> 00:54:37.560
<v Speaker 2>And I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>

1154
00:54:37.561 --> 00:54:39.780
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm rambling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a lot of information so,</v>

1155
00:54:39.781 --> 00:54:40.614
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they get huge amounts of money for </v>

1156
00:54:41.701 --> 00:54:44.020
<v Speaker 2>that and that money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I'm.</v>

1157
00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:45.713
<v Speaker 2>One of the good things about that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that can never be revoked like if you </v>

1158
00:54:48.511 --> 00:54:49.344
<v Speaker 2>leave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one of the problems they had in the </v>

1159
00:54:49.831 --> 00:54:54.720
<v Speaker 2>past was if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you spend $10,000 on credit and say I</v>

1160
00:54:54.721 --> 00:54:55.554
<v Speaker 2>love scientology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be amazing and then you </v>

1161
00:54:57.180 --> 00:55:00.480
<v Speaker 2>like a thousand dollars in your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into your services.</v>

1162
00:55:00.481 --> 00:55:01.314
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this isn't doing anything I want to </v>

1163
00:55:02.041 --> 00:55:04.290
<v Speaker 2>leave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you ask for your money back and</v>

1164
00:55:04.291 --> 00:55:06.270
<v Speaker 2>it's very hard for you to get your money</v>
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>

1165
00:55:06.420 --> 00:55:07.253
<v Speaker 2>Whereas the donations that are made to </v>
<v Speaker 2>something called the Ias in Association </v>

1166
00:55:11.461 --> 00:55:14.400
<v Speaker 2>of Scientologists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't get those back once you leave,</v>

1167
00:55:14.690 --> 00:55:15.523
<v Speaker 2>which I'll make it very simple for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is very rich scientologists who make </v>

1168
00:55:18.451 --> 00:55:20.660
<v Speaker 2>large donations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically.</v>

1169
00:55:20.661 --> 00:55:21.494
<v Speaker 2>There's a guy called Bob Duggan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has a multibillionaire who's donated </v>

1170
00:55:24.721 --> 00:55:26.310
<v Speaker 2>literally tens of millions.</v>

1171
00:55:28.510 --> 00:55:29.180
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's a lot.</v>

1172
00:55:29.180 --> 00:55:31.450
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of actors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who mean.</v>

1173
00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:32.393
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Leah Remini,</v>

1174
00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:33.393
<v Speaker 2>one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1175
00:55:33.930 --> 00:55:38.730
<v Speaker 2>she's one of the most famous detractors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right person who's left,</v>

1176
00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:39.631
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1177
00:55:39.631 --> 00:55:42.480
<v Speaker 2>Until she was like one of his most </v>
<v Speaker 2>famous supporters.</v>

1178
00:55:43.340 --> 00:55:45.100
<v Speaker 2>But that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's weird because like,</v>

1179
00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:47.580
<v Speaker 2>her turnaround was like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1180
00:55:47.581 --> 00:55:49.790
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I have a lot of respect for.</v>

1181
00:55:49.810 --> 00:55:50.643
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a lot of guys like this </v>

1182
00:55:51.211 --> 00:55:52.710
<v Speaker 2>guy who was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was talking about this pitch,</v>

1183
00:55:52.820 --> 00:55:53.653
<v Speaker 2>the infomercial pitch man who did the </v>
<v Speaker 2>orientation video that was taken down </v>

1184
00:55:56.491 --> 00:55:58.320
<v Speaker 2>from youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's called Larry Anderson,</v>

1185
00:55:58.321 --> 00:56:00.100
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And He,</v>

1186
00:56:00.290 --> 00:56:01.123
<v Speaker 2>I really wanted to interview him for our</v>
<v Speaker 2>film because I just thought the </v>

1187
00:56:04.350 --> 00:56:07.050
<v Speaker 2>orientation video is so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of those,</v>

1188
00:56:07.051 --> 00:56:09.560
<v Speaker 2>some is this video where they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1189
00:56:09.660 --> 00:56:11.490
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>welcome to scientology.</v>

1190
00:56:11.850 --> 00:56:15.930
<v Speaker 2>You if at the end of this video you </v>
<v Speaker 2>decide this is not for you,</v>

1191
00:56:16.140 --> 00:56:16.950
<v Speaker 2>that's fine.</v>

1192
00:56:16.950 --> 00:56:20.130
<v Speaker 2>You're welcome to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just as you're free to jump off,</v>

1193
00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:22.560
<v Speaker 2>throw yourself off a bridge or blow your</v>
<v Speaker 2>brains out.</v>

1194
00:56:23.620 --> 00:56:27.040
<v Speaker 2>So it's just very over the top kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

1195
00:56:27.041 --> 00:56:29.860
<v Speaker 2>It's just ludicrous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he left scientology so they couldn't</v>

1196
00:56:29.861 --> 00:56:33.530
<v Speaker 2>show it anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he left an Mo,</v>

1197
00:56:33.570 --> 00:56:34.403
<v Speaker 2>like most high profile defectors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just didn't want anything more to do </v>

1198
00:56:37.751 --> 00:56:38.620
<v Speaker 2>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just like,</v>

1199
00:56:38.621 --> 00:56:39.454
<v Speaker 2>I'm done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And very often they cut a deal where </v>

1200
00:56:41.381 --> 00:56:43.900
<v Speaker 2>they say find the scientology will say </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1201
00:56:43.930 --> 00:56:45.430
<v Speaker 2>we'll let you do the x,</v>
<v Speaker 2>y,</v>

1202
00:56:45.431 --> 00:56:47.650
<v Speaker 2>and Z,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's get some money back,</v>

1203
00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:49.233
<v Speaker 2>speak to your people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your friends and family who is still in </v>

1204
00:56:50.531 --> 00:56:52.990
<v Speaker 2>scientology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we don't want you speaking out.</v>

1205
00:56:53.830 --> 00:56:54.710
<v Speaker 2>And so then the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1206
00:56:54.711 --> 00:56:55.930
<v Speaker 2>the effect will be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1207
00:56:55.931 --> 00:56:57.010
<v Speaker 2>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want a simple life.</v>

1208
00:56:57.660 --> 00:56:58.493
<v Speaker 2>But Leah Remini to her credit has </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually gone out there and absolutely </v>

1209
00:57:03.821 --> 00:57:06.220
<v Speaker 2>made it a mission to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to call them out.</v>

1210
00:57:06.790 --> 00:57:09.330
<v Speaker 2>How far did she get?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know where she,</v>

1211
00:57:09.370 --> 00:57:11.710
<v Speaker 2>I think she was quite far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of the actors.</v>

1212
00:57:11.820 --> 00:57:13.720
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think actors,</v>

1213
00:57:14.050 --> 00:57:14.883
<v Speaker 2>they're considered people of influence </v>
<v Speaker 2>and so they get certain amount of </v>

1214
00:57:17.501 --> 00:57:19.870
<v Speaker 2>services for free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the impression I have.</v>

1215
00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:21.153
<v Speaker 2>And so I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think they're encouraged to go up </v>

1216
00:57:23.021 --> 00:57:26.230
<v Speaker 2>the bridge quite quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a neighbor who was a scientologist</v>

1217
00:57:26.770 --> 00:57:29.640
<v Speaker 2>and he wanted to buy a piece of </v>
<v Speaker 2>property.</v>

1218
00:57:29.670 --> 00:57:33.430
<v Speaker 2>We had a discussion about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how I found out he was scientologists he</v>

1219
00:57:33.431 --> 00:57:34.690
<v Speaker 2>sent out of nowhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1220
00:57:34.780 --> 00:57:35.950
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we started talking about this.</v>

1221
00:57:36.340 --> 00:57:36.761
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1222
00:57:36.761 --> 00:57:38.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking about buying it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

1223
00:57:38.140 --> 00:57:41.400
<v Speaker 2>right now my wife is about to go clear </v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

1224
00:57:41.410 --> 00:57:42.620
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>

1225
00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:43.900
<v Speaker 2>this is a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

1226
00:57:43.901 --> 00:57:44.800
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does that mean?</v>

1227
00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:45.713
<v Speaker 2>And then he starts expressing what it </v>
<v Speaker 2>means and that she's no longer going to </v>

1228
00:57:49.421 --> 00:57:50.254
<v Speaker 2>be influenced by negative thoughts and </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is going to cost $50,000 and it's </v>

1229
00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:57.700
<v Speaker 2>probably more now probably is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>nineties,</v>

1230
00:57:57.701 --> 00:57:58.534
<v Speaker 2>but $50,000 for a ceremony where you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>no longer going to be influenced by </v>

1231
00:58:03.671 --> 00:58:04.504
<v Speaker 2>negative thoughts.</v>

1232
00:58:05.410 --> 00:58:06.243
<v Speaker 2>And then you find out actually footnote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this other thing you have to </v>

1233
00:58:09.611 --> 00:58:13.570
<v Speaker 2>deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's another like 15 levels.</v>

1234
00:58:15.160 --> 00:58:16.260
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1235
00:58:16.261 --> 00:58:17.350
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a funny,</v>

1236
00:58:17.740 --> 00:58:20.020
<v Speaker 2>it's a funny one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you talk to Leah Remini?</v>

1237
00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:20.920
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we approached,</v>

1238
00:58:20.921 --> 00:58:21.190
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1239
00:58:21.190 --> 00:58:23.560
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should explain that we took a specific</v>

1240
00:58:23.561 --> 00:58:25.270
<v Speaker 2>approach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We knew going into it.</v>

1241
00:58:25.570 --> 00:58:26.403
<v Speaker 2>I had been just stating this idea for </v>
<v Speaker 2>years and I'd been fascinated with </v>

1242
00:58:30.521 --> 00:58:35.521
<v Speaker 2>scientology going back to the late </v>
<v Speaker 2>eighties when I was a student and then I</v>

1243
00:58:36.161 --> 00:58:37.840
<v Speaker 2>remember in [inaudible] 90 or </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] 91,</v>

1244
00:58:37.900 --> 00:58:38.733
<v Speaker 2>I took a tour around the l Ron Hubbard </v>
<v Speaker 2>life exhibit there on Hollywood </v>

1245
00:58:42.490 --> 00:58:45.670
<v Speaker 2>Boulevard and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and had this weird feeling of,</v>

1246
00:58:45.730 --> 00:58:47.800
<v Speaker 2>if you've ever gone in where you just </v>
<v Speaker 2>think wow,</v>

1247
00:58:47.801 --> 00:58:48.634
<v Speaker 2>it's like they took a person who was </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of an average Scifi writer and </v>

1248
00:58:52.781 --> 00:58:56.200
<v Speaker 2>attempted to make him sound like he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>the second coming of Jesus.</v>

1249
00:58:56.410 --> 00:59:00.820
<v Speaker 2>And so everything is spun and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just a weird feeling,</v>

1250
00:59:00.821 --> 00:59:01.654
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing a whole museum dedicated to </v>

1251
00:59:03.641 --> 00:59:08.641
<v Speaker 2>someone who seems to have been a </v>
<v Speaker 2>relatively unremarkable person.</v>

1252
00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:11.680
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they're working extremely hard.</v>

1253
00:59:12.470 --> 00:59:13.303
<v Speaker 2>Say like he was one of the youngest ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eagle Scouts to ever qualify in the </v>

1254
00:59:16.481 --> 00:59:17.960
<v Speaker 2>state of Montana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're like,</v>

1255
00:59:17.961 --> 00:59:19.360
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was like,</v>

1256
00:59:19.770 --> 00:59:21.480
<v Speaker 2>my dad was an eagle scout.</v>

1257
00:59:24.040 --> 00:59:26.780
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so then I remember halfway through I</v>

1258
00:59:26.781 --> 00:59:27.590
<v Speaker 2>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well this is,</v>

1259
00:59:27.590 --> 00:59:28.423
<v Speaker 2>this was funny for 10 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then an hour later when you're on </v>

1260
00:59:30.351 --> 00:59:32.210
<v Speaker 2>this guided tour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had enough.</v>

1261
00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:33.820
<v Speaker 2>And so I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really need to leave.</v>

1262
00:59:34.080 --> 00:59:35.290
<v Speaker 2>Where do you need to go?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1263
00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:36.133
<v Speaker 2>what's so important that it's more </v>
<v Speaker 2>important than you've seen in the rest </v>

1264
00:59:37.761 --> 00:59:38.594
<v Speaker 2>of the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I suddenly felt under pressure that </v>

1265
00:59:39.891 --> 00:59:41.570
<v Speaker 2>uncomfortable feeling of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh wow.</v>

1266
00:59:42.110 --> 00:59:42.943
<v Speaker 2>And I had to pretend that I needed to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere just to get out of the </v>

1267
00:59:45.441 --> 00:59:46.280
<v Speaker 2>building.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

1268
00:59:46.700 --> 00:59:49.910
<v Speaker 2>so years go by and I think I'd love to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make a program about it and then I could</v>

1269
00:59:49.911 --> 00:59:53.030
<v Speaker 2>never quite find that I approached them </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they said,</v>

1270
00:59:53.031 --> 00:59:54.680
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>long story short,</v>

1271
00:59:54.681 --> 00:59:55.710
<v Speaker 2>we're not really interested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

1272
00:59:55.720 --> 00:59:56.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1273
00:59:56.200 --> 00:59:58.010
<v Speaker 2>they took me on a tour of the celebrity </v>
<v Speaker 2>center.</v>

1274
00:59:58.011 --> 00:59:58.844
<v Speaker 2>They strung me along for a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was pretty clear quite quickly </v>

1275
01:00:01.071 --> 01:00:02.390
<v Speaker 2>that they weren't going to let me in.</v>

1276
01:00:02.750 --> 01:00:03.583
<v Speaker 2>So a few more years went by and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>approached by a Hollywood producer </v>

1277
01:00:08.691 --> 01:00:09.920
<v Speaker 2>called Simon Chinn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

1278
01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:13.040
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who made a man on wire and searching for</v>

1279
01:00:13.041 --> 01:00:14.470
<v Speaker 2>sugar man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So He's,</v>

1280
01:00:14.530 --> 01:00:16.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's well credentialed and he's like,</v>

1281
01:00:16.251 --> 01:00:17.084
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should do something about </v>

1282
01:00:17.301 --> 01:00:18.134
<v Speaker 2>scientology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gave him the spiel about why I hadn't </v>

1283
01:00:19.521 --> 01:00:21.770
<v Speaker 2>because they won't let me in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as you know,</v>

1284
01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:24.530
<v Speaker 2>my way of making documentaries is by </v>
<v Speaker 2>invitation,</v>

1285
01:00:24.531 --> 01:00:25.364
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I make an approach and people say yes </v>

1286
01:00:26.810 --> 01:00:27.920
<v Speaker 2>and they let me in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1287
01:00:27.921 --> 01:00:30.260
<v Speaker 2>you're very polite in Europe and </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>

1288
01:00:30.261 --> 01:00:34.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done whatever in a big game hunting</v>

1289
01:00:34.281 --> 01:00:37.500
<v Speaker 2>or the Westboro Baptist church or Gurus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1290
01:00:37.510 --> 01:00:38.900
<v Speaker 2>in India.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's always,</v>

1291
01:00:38.901 --> 01:00:40.040
<v Speaker 2>I say like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can we come and film?</v>

1292
01:00:40.041 --> 01:00:41.950
<v Speaker 2>And they say yes and we do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

1293
01:00:42.470 --> 01:00:43.303
<v Speaker 2>I just couldn't get my head around how </v>
<v Speaker 2>you make a film where the people don't </v>

1294
01:00:46.491 --> 01:00:47.930
<v Speaker 2>want you to make the film.</v>

1295
01:00:48.050 --> 01:00:48.883
<v Speaker 2>As I knew they didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And have it be still true to what I do </v>

1296
01:00:52.941 --> 01:00:53.774
<v Speaker 2>in some way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I didn't want it to be a kind of </v>

1297
01:00:56.151 --> 01:00:58.370
<v Speaker 2>just poking them for the sake of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>type of thing.</v>

1298
01:00:58.790 --> 01:01:01.700
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we decided that there was a way of doing</v>

1299
01:01:01.701 --> 01:01:02.534
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>using reenactments in which we took a </v>

1300
01:01:04.131 --> 01:01:04.964
<v Speaker 2>sort of approach to the reenactments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the whole process of casting and </v>

1301
01:01:09.711 --> 01:01:10.544
<v Speaker 2>reenacting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how you do scientology using actors was </v>

1302
01:01:14.451 --> 01:01:15.350
<v Speaker 2>filmed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

1303
01:01:15.351 --> 01:01:16.184
<v Speaker 2>we filmed casting a character to play </v>
<v Speaker 2>Tom Cruise costing an actor to play </v>

1304
01:01:19.491 --> 01:01:20.324
<v Speaker 2>David miscavige a roleplaying the </v>
<v Speaker 2>different lines and used x </v>

1305
01:01:25.310 --> 01:01:28.430
<v Speaker 2>scientologists to kind of co-direct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they were like,</v>

1306
01:01:28.431 --> 01:01:29.270
<v Speaker 2>this is how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1307
01:01:29.450 --> 01:01:32.330
<v Speaker 2>this is how you do it and this is what </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientology is.</v>

1308
01:01:32.540 --> 01:01:34.940
<v Speaker 2>And this was what it was like when I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>in scientology.</v>

1309
01:01:35.630 --> 01:01:36.463
<v Speaker 2>And really a part of it was knowing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>once we did that in and around </v>

1310
01:01:39.651 --> 01:01:40.484
<v Speaker 2>Hollywood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because Hollywood is so central to </v>

1311
01:01:41.781 --> 01:01:42.614
<v Speaker 2>scientology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would get wind of what we were </v>

1312
01:01:44.571 --> 01:01:47.810
<v Speaker 2>doing and would start coming to us.</v>

1313
01:01:48.170 --> 01:01:49.003
<v Speaker 2>So there'd be this wraparound of them </v>
<v Speaker 2>and sure they shut up and stop filming </v>

1314
01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:54.020
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1315
01:01:54.021 --> 01:01:54.854
<v Speaker 2>and it turns out they were making a </v>
<v Speaker 2>documentary about me making my film </v>

1316
01:01:57.861 --> 01:02:00.700
<v Speaker 2>about scientology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then it becomes this sort of whole,</v>

1317
01:02:00.701 --> 01:02:02.570
<v Speaker 2>when is that getting released?</v>
<v Speaker 2>January.</v>

1318
01:02:02.571 --> 01:02:02.931
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1319
01:02:02.931 --> 01:02:04.490
<v Speaker 2>it's out in the UK.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In October.</v>

1320
01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:06.080
<v Speaker 2>January.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Mean Yours.</v>

1321
01:02:06.170 --> 01:02:07.520
<v Speaker 2>The one on you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1322
01:02:07.521 --> 01:02:09.320
<v Speaker 2>there one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1323
01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:11.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it'll come out.</v>

1324
01:02:12.230 --> 01:02:13.420
<v Speaker 2>It's a great question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1325
01:02:13.421 --> 01:02:14.254
<v Speaker 2>I'm surprised it's not out yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it'll come out probably in </v>

1326
01:02:18.141 --> 01:02:18.974
<v Speaker 2>January.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

1327
01:02:19.410 --> 01:02:20.243
<v Speaker 2>And what do you think it'll be about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it'll be a lot like what they </v>

1328
01:02:24.390 --> 01:02:27.840
<v Speaker 2>have done to other journalists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did one to give me.</v>

1329
01:02:27.841 --> 01:02:30.390
<v Speaker 2>They did one on um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Larry,</v>

1330
01:02:30.391 --> 01:02:31.520
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do them on x,</v>

1331
01:02:31.530 --> 01:02:35.340
<v Speaker 2>scientologists midair of sufficient kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of profile.</v>

1332
01:02:35.550 --> 01:02:38.370
<v Speaker 2>It will be a 10 to 15 minute thing.</v>

1333
01:02:38.550 --> 01:02:39.150
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1334
01:02:39.150 --> 01:02:39.983
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll extract any photograph where I </v>

1335
01:02:42.241 --> 01:02:43.570
<v Speaker 2>look like a Dick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1336
01:02:43.571 --> 01:02:44.404
<v Speaker 2>what I look ugly or ludicrous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any ill advised bit of publicity I ever </v>

1337
01:02:48.031 --> 01:02:50.820
<v Speaker 2>did where I was promoting a series and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>

1338
01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:51.673
<v Speaker 2>it looked goofy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll say like this is a serious </v>

1339
01:02:54.211 --> 01:02:55.044
<v Speaker 2>journalist and then they'll take quotes </v>
<v Speaker 2>from interviews out of context to make </v>

1340
01:02:58.051 --> 01:03:00.930
<v Speaker 2>me sound like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>either a goofball or,</v>

1341
01:03:00.931 --> 01:03:04.980
<v Speaker 2>or kind of malicious a deceiver.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1342
01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:06.113
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to really see the DNA of </v>

1343
01:03:07.411 --> 01:03:09.480
<v Speaker 2>scientology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I often think because occasionally I get</v>

1344
01:03:09.481 --> 01:03:11.400
<v Speaker 2>caught in this mindset of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1345
01:03:11.401 --> 01:03:13.440
<v Speaker 2>what is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what is it?</v>

1346
01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:14.513
<v Speaker 2>Just another religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no better or worse than other </v>

1347
01:03:16.531 --> 01:03:18.810
<v Speaker 2>religions really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then some,</v>

1348
01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:21.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes you can slightly lose,</v>

1349
01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:21.953
<v Speaker 2>you go native slightly or you're on </v>
<v Speaker 2>their websites and your thing like it </v>

1350
01:03:24.090 --> 01:03:24.930
<v Speaker 2>covered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of this makes sense.</v>

1351
01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:29.130
<v Speaker 2>But if you look at how they attack their</v>
<v Speaker 2>enemies,</v>

1352
01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:32.360
<v Speaker 2>they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So unlike other religions,</v>

1353
01:03:32.361 --> 01:03:34.440
<v Speaker 2>certainly unlike Christianity for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>most part,</v>

1354
01:03:34.830 --> 01:03:35.663
<v Speaker 2>so official scientology's pronouncements</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they attack x members and </v>

1355
01:03:39.181 --> 01:03:44.181
<v Speaker 2>journalists are so sort of tabloid and </v>
<v Speaker 2>childish and so malicious and nasty,</v>

1356
01:03:45.090 --> 01:03:48.300
<v Speaker 2>you really see into something deep about</v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

1357
01:03:48.330 --> 01:03:49.770
<v Speaker 2>their mindset,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because their view is,</v>

1358
01:03:49.771 --> 01:03:52.590
<v Speaker 2>you mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that if you're a suppressive person,</v>

1359
01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:53.513
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who's attempting to hold </v>

1360
01:03:54.631 --> 01:03:55.464
<v Speaker 2>scientology back then you are fair game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything they could do almost anything </v>

1361
01:04:01.530 --> 01:04:05.820
<v Speaker 2>to try and put you out of business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that these documentaries,</v>

1362
01:04:05.821 --> 01:04:09.360
<v Speaker 2>whether it's going clear the book by </v>
<v Speaker 2>Lawrence Wright or the other woman,</v>

1363
01:04:09.361 --> 01:04:13.590
<v Speaker 2>what was the name of Janet Reitman was </v>
<v Speaker 2>her bucket inside scientology.</v>

1364
01:04:13.591 --> 01:04:14.424
<v Speaker 2>You think that all this data,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this accumulative data reaches any of </v>

1365
01:04:17.791 --> 01:04:19.830
<v Speaker 2>the members that are inside scientology?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't.</v>

1366
01:04:19.930 --> 01:04:21.100
<v Speaker 2>They don't ever examined it.</v>

1367
01:04:21.110 --> 01:04:22.500
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no way.</v>

1368
01:04:22.690 --> 01:04:23.390
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

1369
01:04:23.390 --> 01:04:26.340
<v Speaker 2>it's considered end theater,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a scientology term.</v>

1370
01:04:26.341 --> 01:04:30.010
<v Speaker 2>It means in turbulator good data.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love guy.</v>

1371
01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:33.480
<v Speaker 2>This is like catnip to explaining this </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff kind of.</v>

1372
01:04:33.481 --> 01:04:35.460
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like I said,</v>

1373
01:04:35.461 --> 01:04:40.210
<v Speaker 2>I was steeped in it for three years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kind of absorbing all your whole life or</v>

1374
01:04:41.650 --> 01:04:43.200
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Constantly but,</v>

1375
01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:47.070
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would spend a few days kind of hours</v>

1376
01:04:47.071 --> 01:04:47.904
<v Speaker 2>would go by the end of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were emerging like have I learned </v>

1377
01:04:50.161 --> 01:04:53.430
<v Speaker 2>anything?</v>
<v Speaker 2>All I know now is just absurd terms.</v>

1378
01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:58.920
<v Speaker 2>The no use to anyone like and Feta and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in turbulators data energies,</v>

1379
01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:02.250
<v Speaker 2>fader is Dayton's a spirits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Data is spiritual positive,</v>

1380
01:05:02.251 --> 01:05:04.650
<v Speaker 2>spiritual energy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but interpolated is bad.</v>

1381
01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:06.360
<v Speaker 2>So it's basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Theater.</v>

1382
01:05:06.361 --> 01:05:09.020
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of bad for your energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

1383
01:05:09.030 --> 01:05:09.863
<v Speaker 2>It's [inaudible] to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for you to be in scientology and it can </v>

1384
01:05:12.751 --> 01:05:16.890
<v Speaker 2>be exposed to anything negative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything critical of scientology,</v>

1385
01:05:16.891 --> 01:05:20.980
<v Speaker 2>so encouraged to be off the internet and</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be off,</v>

1386
01:05:21.010 --> 01:05:21.843
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't consume anything you think might </v>

1387
01:05:23.021 --> 01:05:23.854
<v Speaker 2>be critical.</v>

1388
01:05:24.430 --> 01:05:26.230
<v Speaker 2>They're encouraged to be off the </v>
<v Speaker 2>internet.</v>

1389
01:05:26.590 --> 01:05:27.423
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I should say I should say that </v>

1390
01:05:29.621 --> 01:05:33.580
<v Speaker 2>applies to people within the sea org,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the inner circle of scientology and I</v>

1391
01:05:34.090 --> 01:05:34.923
<v Speaker 2>explain that it's a really important </v>
<v Speaker 2>distinction because I'm absolutely </v>

1392
01:05:39.251 --> 01:05:42.700
<v Speaker 2>certain that there's plenty of extremely</v>
<v Speaker 2>nice,</v>

1393
01:05:42.701 --> 01:05:43.534
<v Speaker 2>well adjusted scientologists people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>consider themselves scientologists </v>

1394
01:05:47.230 --> 01:05:48.880
<v Speaker 2>neighbor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a really nice guy,</v>

<v Speaker 2>betty was and I'm sure I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything I hear about Beck,</v>

1396

<v Speaker 2>the musician is that he's a nice guy and</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1397
01:05:55.810 --> 01:05:57.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure Giovanni Ribisi isn't,</v>

1398
01:05:57.991 --> 01:06:00.520
<v Speaker 2>is a nice guy and yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

1401
01:06:04.390 --> 01:06:06.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean she makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

1402
01:06:06.850 --> 01:06:08.350
<v Speaker 2>Juliette Lewis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1403
01:06:08.530 --> 01:06:10.930
<v Speaker 2>I bet she's nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet she's very nice.</v>

1404
01:06:10.970 --> 01:06:12.430
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she and I have gone back and forth.</v>

1405
01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:15.340
<v Speaker 2>We've talked to each other through a </v>
<v Speaker 2>messages on twitter.</v>

1406
01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:16.433
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did it get her in talk to Danny </v>

1407
01:06:18.490 --> 01:06:19.323
<v Speaker 2>Masterson?</v>

1408
01:06:20.230 --> 01:06:24.940
<v Speaker 2>He's from easily that 17th show he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>into.</v>

1409
01:06:25.150 --> 01:06:26.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Woo.</v>

1410
01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:28.120
<v Speaker 2>And Jason Lee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

1411
01:06:28.630 --> 01:06:30.880
<v Speaker 2>I think he might be out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know who I mean?</v>

1412
01:06:30.910 --> 01:06:32.080
<v Speaker 2>My name is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

1413
01:06:32.081 --> 01:06:33.130
<v Speaker 2>that guy's in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1414
01:06:33.220 --> 01:06:34.030
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

1415
01:06:34.030 --> 01:06:36.100
<v Speaker 2>you didn't spend very long down the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rabbit hole.</v>

1416
01:06:36.550 --> 01:06:38.430
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my rabbit hole was not limited.</v>

1417
01:06:38.710 --> 01:06:41.260
<v Speaker 2>I try to avoid any rabbit hole that </v>
<v Speaker 2>involve celebrities,</v>

1418
01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:45.880
<v Speaker 2>but scientology is predicated on one </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing l Ron Hubbard got right.</v>

1419
01:06:45.881 --> 01:06:48.250
<v Speaker 2>Was the idea that if you get celebrities</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1420
01:06:48.310 --> 01:06:49.630
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you,</v>

1421
01:06:49.930 --> 01:06:53.380
<v Speaker 2>you've got a kind of golden ticket to </v>
<v Speaker 2>reaching the masses.</v>

1422
01:06:53.620 --> 01:06:54.371
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1423
01:06:54.371 --> 01:06:56.860
<v Speaker 2>I jokingly thought about joining when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>first came here,</v>

1424
01:06:56.861 --> 01:06:57.850
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe that's the move,</v>

1425
01:06:57.870 --> 01:06:58.703
<v Speaker 2>just get it become a scientologist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could make a documentary about </v>

1426
01:07:00.941 --> 01:07:01.774
<v Speaker 2>scientology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would be totally different because </v>

1427
01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:04.233
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe we've blown it by even talking </v>

1428
01:07:06.221 --> 01:07:07.990
<v Speaker 2>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you'd gone under,</v>

1429
01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:11.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they would listen.</v>

1430
01:07:11.530 --> 01:07:13.690
<v Speaker 2>They would probably fucking hate me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1431
01:07:13.750 --> 01:07:14.583
<v Speaker 2>it depends what you've got out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's too late to a documentary maker </v>

1432
01:07:17.171 --> 01:07:18.004
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't have that sort of attention </v>

1433
01:07:19.271 --> 01:07:20.440
<v Speaker 2>span that you have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could,</v>

1434
01:07:20.441 --> 01:07:22.080
<v Speaker 2>you could go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could have gone undercover.</v>

1435
01:07:22.110 --> 01:07:22.943
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would have been such a great scalp </v>

1436
01:07:23.831 --> 01:07:25.060
<v Speaker 2>for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would have.</v>

1437
01:07:25.061 --> 01:07:27.730
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because when was the last time you heard</v>

1438
01:07:27.731 --> 01:07:30.610
<v Speaker 2>of an established celebrity actor </v>
<v Speaker 2>joining,</v>

1439
01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:32.960
<v Speaker 2>joining like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1440
01:07:33.130 --> 01:07:34.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you imagine if maybe they can.</v>

1441
01:07:35.020 --> 01:07:39.070
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's when will smith,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a sniff that he might be going</v>

1442
01:07:39.071 --> 01:07:42.400
<v Speaker 2>that way and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it went and it didn't pan out.</v>

1443
01:07:42.820 --> 01:07:43.653
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was an unbeliever and they were </v>

1444
01:07:44.891 --> 01:07:45.724
<v Speaker 2>trying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a rumor that David Beckham </v>

1445
01:07:46.631 --> 01:07:47.464
<v Speaker 2>might be flirting with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean none of these things were </v>

1446
01:07:49.930 --> 01:07:53.800
<v Speaker 2>born out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What they could do for you if you were a</v>

1447
01:07:53.801 --> 01:07:54.634
<v Speaker 2>David Beckham or maybe even for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is they could act as like a gang that's </v>

1448
01:07:59.711 --> 01:08:02.470
<v Speaker 2>sort of like your policy covers your </v>
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>

1449
01:08:02.630 --> 01:08:04.120
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that'd be.</v>

1450
01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:07.720
<v Speaker 2>And when I was doing the film,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went in a totally undercover,</v>

1451
01:08:07.721 --> 01:08:10.540
<v Speaker 2>but I went in Norway for a sequence in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the film.</v>

1452
01:08:10.541 --> 01:08:13.630
<v Speaker 2>I just to sort of keep myself grounded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to keep it all real,</v>

1453
01:08:13.780 --> 01:08:14.613
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because one of the challenges with when </v>

1454
01:08:15.921 --> 01:08:16.754
<v Speaker 2>you're not exposed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not actually having day to day </v>

1455
01:08:18.381 --> 01:08:20.270
<v Speaker 2>contact with the subject that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>covering.</v>

1456
01:08:20.271 --> 01:08:25.271
<v Speaker 2>It's very easy to slip into a us and </v>
<v Speaker 2>them mentality of your own and like,</v>

1457
01:08:25.370 --> 01:08:27.360
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>scary scientologists Ooh,</v>

1458
01:08:27.361 --> 01:08:29.060
<v Speaker 2>they're bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And actually,</v>

1459
01:08:29.061 --> 01:08:29.930
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1460
01:08:30.050 --> 01:08:31.040
<v Speaker 2>they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're good people,</v>

1461
01:08:31.041 --> 01:08:31.770
<v Speaker 2>many of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1462
01:08:31.770 --> 01:08:35.140
<v Speaker 2>and so I wanted to make them real and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>went along to um,</v>

1463
01:08:35.430 --> 01:08:36.263
<v Speaker 2>scientology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oregon just sort of chatted to some </v>

1464
01:08:38.451 --> 01:08:39.141
<v Speaker 2>people until,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1465
01:08:39.141 --> 01:08:43.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm a make documentaries and things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm interested in this subject,</v>

1466
01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:44.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's it all about?</v>

1467
01:08:44.871 --> 01:08:45.704
<v Speaker 2>And they really did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things they do is a fairly </v>

1468
01:08:48.321 --> 01:08:49.154
<v Speaker 2>hard sell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you got the impression that they </v>

1469
01:08:51.981 --> 01:08:56.720
<v Speaker 2>would 100 percent kind of take your </v>
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

1470
01:08:59.150 --> 01:09:00.350
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't accept you.</v>

1471
01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:03.020
<v Speaker 2>They would tell you money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they would absolutely,</v>

1472
01:09:03.021 --> 01:09:05.150
<v Speaker 2>I think be right on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1473
01:09:05.350 --> 01:09:05.720
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1474
01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:09.140
<v Speaker 2>I kind of lost confidence in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going to say 100 percent.</v>

1475
01:09:09.141 --> 01:09:10.980
<v Speaker 2>You got to have your back and be or </v>
<v Speaker 2>gang.</v>

1476
01:09:10.981 --> 01:09:13.010
<v Speaker 2>But I don't know if I really did have </v>
<v Speaker 2>that sense.</v>

1477
01:09:13.011 --> 01:09:14.210
<v Speaker 2>I think if you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they know,</v>

1478
01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:16.600
<v Speaker 2>if they knew you were a celebrity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they thought you were,</v>

1479
01:09:17.750 --> 01:09:20.450
<v Speaker 2>they would really go to the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would get special treatment.</v>

1480
01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:23.780
<v Speaker 2>I was in San Diego when I was filming </v>
<v Speaker 2>this television show.</v>

1481
01:09:23.781 --> 01:09:24.614
<v Speaker 2>We had a few hours downtime and they had</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of these booths set up where you </v>

1482
01:09:27.681 --> 01:09:30.680
<v Speaker 2>would go over there and hold onto the </v>
<v Speaker 2>those cans.</v>

1483
01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:33.680
<v Speaker 2>You meet her and I did all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How long did you.</v>

1484
01:09:33.681 --> 01:09:35.720
<v Speaker 2>How many sessions did you do or just </v>
<v Speaker 2>one?</v>

1485
01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:38.240
<v Speaker 2>Just one while I was there and it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty good,</v>

1486
01:09:38.241 --> 01:09:38.970
<v Speaker 2>wasn't it?</v>

1487
01:09:38.970 --> 01:09:41.300
<v Speaker 2>It was boring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was it the guy that.</v>

1488
01:09:41.330 --> 01:09:44.150
<v Speaker 2>The guy who I got was very </v>
<v Speaker 2>unenthusiastic.</v>

1489
01:09:44.151 --> 01:09:46.340
<v Speaker 2>He's just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seemed like something.</v>

1490
01:09:46.350 --> 01:09:49.880
<v Speaker 2>They were exposed to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're supposed to be unenthusiastic.</v>

1491
01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:51.750
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the meters,</v>

1492
01:09:51.770 --> 01:09:54.260
<v Speaker 2>there's a script for how it's called </v>
<v Speaker 2>being an auditor.</v>

1493
01:09:54.290 --> 01:09:55.123
<v Speaker 2>When you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When someone's auditing you in a sense </v>

1494
01:09:55.911 --> 01:09:57.800
<v Speaker 2>being the therapist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have a script.</v>

1495
01:09:57.801 --> 01:09:58.670
<v Speaker 2>They have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's called.</v>

1496
01:09:58.700 --> 01:09:59.533
<v Speaker 2>They have to sit there comfortably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they are not supposed to show any </v>

1497
01:10:03.351 --> 01:10:06.950
<v Speaker 2>emotion when they're auditing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1498
01:10:07.010 --> 01:10:07.843
<v Speaker 2>he's doing it publicly to holding onto </v>
<v Speaker 2>this thing and asking me questions as </v>

1499
01:10:10.641 --> 01:10:13.240
<v Speaker 2>you read in the needle and saying yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and did he say that?</v>

1500
01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:14.113
<v Speaker 2>Is there a prior something that there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>a whole script they'd sort of say and </v>

1501
01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:20.540
<v Speaker 2>did you have to say like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had back pain and then they're like,</v>

1502
01:10:21.270 --> 01:10:23.330
<v Speaker 2>why would you remember what road you </v>
<v Speaker 2>went down with your,</v>

1503
01:10:23.490 --> 01:10:24.380
<v Speaker 2>with what you were saying?</v>

1504
01:10:24.540 --> 01:10:29.060
<v Speaker 2>Partly just remember thinking this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's nothing that's special.</v>

1505
01:10:29.090 --> 01:10:31.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy seemed like he,</v>

1506
01:10:31.580 --> 01:10:32.413
<v Speaker 2>they were forcing them to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't seem like this is something </v>

1507
01:10:34.251 --> 01:10:35.084
<v Speaker 2>that he was interested in is just really</v>
<v Speaker 2>not interested in what he was doing and </v>

1508
01:10:39.460 --> 01:10:41.540
<v Speaker 2>he seemed like a volunteer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's interesting.</v>

1509
01:10:41.541 --> 01:10:42.374
<v Speaker 2>I mean if on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they're auditing they're supposed </v>

1510
01:10:43.941 --> 01:10:46.870
<v Speaker 2>to be somewhat blank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A big thing in scientology is,</v>

1511
01:10:46.910 --> 01:10:47.743
<v Speaker 2>is I'm sort of being comfortable in </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself and not like learning how to </v>

1512
01:10:51.711 --> 01:10:55.760
<v Speaker 2>stare at someone that there's a drill </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we do in the film where you have to</v>

1513
01:10:55.761 --> 01:10:59.840
<v Speaker 2>sit and stare at someone without saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything literally for like minutes,</v>

1514
01:10:59.841 --> 01:11:01.740
<v Speaker 2>if not hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

1515
01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:04.490
<v Speaker 2>it's actually a powerful tool because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's slightly,</v>

1516
01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:05.131
<v Speaker 2>it's all about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1517
01:11:05.131 --> 01:11:06.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm unembarrassed bubble,</v>

1518
01:11:06.890 --> 01:11:07.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna,</v>

1519
01:11:07.550 --> 01:11:08.383
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to own any sort of sense of </v>

1520
01:11:10.190 --> 01:11:14.040
<v Speaker 2>awkwardness by just like I'm impermeable</v>
<v Speaker 2>to any kind of social</v>

1521
01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:16.230
<v Speaker 3>influence you think you can put on me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1522
01:11:17.010 --> 01:11:20.250
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the paradoxes of being kind </v>
<v Speaker 3>of really controlling religious movement</v>

1523
01:11:20.251 --> 01:11:24.030
<v Speaker 3>because so much of it is about </v>
<v Speaker 3>controlling yourself.</v>

1524
01:11:24.090 --> 01:11:26.880
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And not allowing other people's thoughts</v>

1525
01:11:26.881 --> 01:11:28.680
<v Speaker 3>are negative actions to control you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>control you.</v>

1526
01:11:28.681 --> 01:11:29.514
<v Speaker 3>And actually a big thing as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things Tom Cruz talks </v>

1527
01:11:31.441 --> 01:11:36.441
<v Speaker 3>about when he's in his video is a pts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a SP confronting shuttering suppression.</v>

1528
01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:41.800
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1529
01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:44.040
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I said they got my acronym</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1530
01:11:44.041 --> 01:11:46.080
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his thing is,</v>

1531
01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:48.320
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he says like,</v>

1532
01:11:48.330 --> 01:11:49.163
<v Speaker 3>one of the best things he learned in </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientology was how to confront and </v>

1533
01:11:51.661 --> 01:11:52.800
<v Speaker 3>shatter suppression.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1534
01:11:53.010 --> 01:11:53.843
<v Speaker 3>So anytime you see him in an interview </v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's a few of them on youtube </v>

1535
01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:57.593
<v Speaker 3>where he's big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he thinks he's getting a cheeky </v>

1536
01:11:59.311 --> 01:12:00.144
<v Speaker 3>question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can see he kinda gets a steely look </v>

1537
01:12:02.611 --> 01:12:05.430
<v Speaker 3>where it's a sort of it not exactly </v>
<v Speaker 3>adversarial.</v>

1538
01:12:05.430 --> 01:12:06.840
<v Speaker 3>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1539
01:12:06.841 --> 01:12:09.780
<v Speaker 3>you're out of line buddy and we're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to allow our interview.</v>

1540
01:12:09.810 --> 01:12:10.643
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was devastating for his career and </v>

1541
01:12:13.780 --> 01:12:16.200
<v Speaker 3>short term he recovered from it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there was.</v>

1542
01:12:16.260 --> 01:12:21.260
<v Speaker 3>That was a window into madness and into </v>
<v Speaker 3>what he's really all about.</v>

1543
01:12:21.510 --> 01:12:23.760
<v Speaker 3>When you know that's the scary part.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1544
01:12:23.761 --> 01:12:27.210
<v Speaker 3>as much as I say like there's a big </v>
<v Speaker 3>chunk of it that feels kind of valid,</v>

1545
01:12:27.211 --> 01:12:28.770
<v Speaker 3>a normal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe even therapeutic,</v>

1546
01:12:28.771 --> 01:12:32.910
<v Speaker 3>but when you tip into thinking that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're the only one that you have,</v>

1547
01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:33.953
<v Speaker 3>you're the authority on mental illness </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's dangerous individual issues </v>

1548
01:12:38.851 --> 01:12:39.684
<v Speaker 3>with people that you have not diagnosed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have any medical training </v>

1549
01:12:42.091 --> 01:12:42.924
<v Speaker 3>whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't know what their specific </v>

1550
01:12:44.551 --> 01:12:45.384
<v Speaker 3>neurochemistry is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't know the effect of the </v>

1551
01:12:47.431 --> 01:12:48.264
<v Speaker 3>medication and whether it's enhancing or</v>
<v Speaker 3>hurting them and you just have this </v>

1552
01:12:51.211 --> 01:12:52.044
<v Speaker 3>blanket view of psychiatry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was a an issue that l Ron Hubbard </v>

1553
01:12:56.101 --> 01:12:58.620
<v Speaker 3>had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you go down sunset,</v>

1554
01:12:59.700 --> 01:13:03.150
<v Speaker 3>sunset on sunset,</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychiatry kills.</v>

1555
01:13:03.150 --> 01:13:05.190
<v Speaker 3>It's psychiatry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the industry of death.</v>

1556
01:13:05.870 --> 01:13:10.350
<v Speaker 3>That's a fun often and that's one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>their centers,</v>

1557
01:13:10.351 --> 01:13:10.901
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1558
01:13:10.901 --> 01:13:11.734
<v Speaker 3>If you go in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll explain the CC her citizens' </v>

1559
01:13:14.490 --> 01:13:18.540
<v Speaker 3>Commission on Human Rights and here's my</v>
<v Speaker 3>issue with that.</v>

1560
01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:23.190
<v Speaker 3>I think prescription drugs are </v>
<v Speaker 3>overprescribed.</v>

1561
01:13:23.700 --> 01:13:24.533
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a real argument that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of people that are on </v>

1562
01:13:26.950 --> 01:13:29.460
<v Speaker 3>antidepressants that shouldn't be on </v>
<v Speaker 3>antidepressants.</v>

1563
01:13:29.700 --> 01:13:31.740
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a lot of natural </v>
<v Speaker 3>alternatives.</v>

1564
01:13:31.741 --> 01:13:32.574
<v Speaker 3>One of them being exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of them being and enhancing your </v>

1565
01:13:35.251 --> 01:13:39.630
<v Speaker 3>standing in life in terms of like what </v>
<v Speaker 3>you do for a living or where you live or</v>

1566
01:13:39.690 --> 01:13:41.280
<v Speaker 3>you know the people that you hang out </v>
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>

1567
01:13:41.460 --> 01:13:42.293
<v Speaker 3>All those things can affect the way you </v>
<v Speaker 3>feel and that can be interpreted as </v>

1568
01:13:45.841 --> 01:13:47.020
<v Speaker 3>depression.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of.</v>

1569
01:13:47.021 --> 01:13:47.854
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's a reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If your life is shit of all the aspects </v>

1570
01:13:50.971 --> 01:13:52.410
<v Speaker 3>of your life is shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You feel bad,</v>

1571
01:13:52.470 --> 01:13:54.310
<v Speaker 3>the solution is not a pill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1572
01:13:54.780 --> 01:13:59.780
<v Speaker 3>So I think in some ways they've got </v>
<v Speaker 3>something to say that makes some sort of</v>

1573
01:13:59.941 --> 01:14:03.500
<v Speaker 3>sense in a weird way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the dangerous part because it's a</v>

1574
01:14:03.501 --> 01:14:04.334
<v Speaker 3>sec.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's with scientology into sex with a </v>

1575
01:14:05.491 --> 01:14:08.940
<v Speaker 3>totally valid social critique.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1576
01:14:09.390 --> 01:14:11.980
<v Speaker 3>The trouble is if you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have someone who's</v>

1577
01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:16.450
<v Speaker 2>heavily psychotic and it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a medication induced psychosis.</v>

1578
01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:17.433
<v Speaker 2>Psychosis is a real medical phenomenon </v>
<v Speaker 2>and a scientology is not going to take </v>

1579
01:14:22.391 --> 01:14:24.040
<v Speaker 2>them on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you go to scientology and say,</v>

1580
01:14:24.041 --> 01:14:26.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm interested in scientology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had a couple of psychotic breaks.</v>

1581
01:14:27.370 --> 01:14:28.203
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I really think you could help me </v>

1582
01:14:29.291 --> 01:14:30.310
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not going to say,</v>

1583
01:14:30.460 --> 01:14:31.271
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come with us.</v>

1584
01:14:31.271 --> 01:14:31.810
<v Speaker 2>We'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll,</v>

1585
01:14:31.810 --> 01:14:32.643
<v Speaker 2>they'll run a mile from you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they critiquing people who they have </v>

1586
01:14:35.921 --> 01:14:38.770
<v Speaker 2>no intention of helping themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

1587
01:14:39.430 --> 01:14:40.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you say,</v>

1588
01:14:40.481 --> 01:14:41.470
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and by the way,</v>

1589
01:14:41.830 --> 01:14:46.830
<v Speaker 2>I've used some in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was medicated for my psychosis.</v>

1590
01:14:46.990 --> 01:14:47.561
<v Speaker 2>They'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1591
01:14:47.561 --> 01:14:50.620
<v Speaker 2>that disqualifies you from treatment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I went to my one,</v>

1592
01:14:51.030 --> 01:14:52.870
<v Speaker 2>they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you thought forms of intervention,</v>

1593
01:14:52.871 --> 01:14:55.600
<v Speaker 2>have you had in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you done any sort of psychiatry?</v>

1594
01:14:55.601 --> 01:14:57.040
<v Speaker 2>Have you had any problems like that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

1595
01:14:57.041 --> 01:14:57.601
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1596
01:14:57.601 --> 01:14:58.630
<v Speaker 2>but I've had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1597
01:14:59.350 --> 01:15:01.860
<v Speaker 2>a little bit of therapy over the years </v>
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>

1598
01:15:01.890 --> 01:15:03.370
<v Speaker 2>What have you done?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1599
01:15:03.371 --> 01:15:04.204
<v Speaker 2>I did a few sessions of CBT.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cognitive behavior therapy is kind of </v>

1600
01:15:07.181 --> 01:15:08.014
<v Speaker 2>bog standard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about problems or things that </v>

1601
01:15:10.791 --> 01:15:12.370
<v Speaker 2>you could do differently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The woman's like,</v>

1602
01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:13.010
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1603
01:15:13.010 --> 01:15:14.620
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just give me five minutes.</v>

1604
01:15:14.621 --> 01:15:15.454
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she left the room to check whether </v>

1605
01:15:16.691 --> 01:15:19.150
<v Speaker 2>that disqualified me and came back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1606
01:15:19.151 --> 01:15:20.050
<v Speaker 2>That's not a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1607
01:15:20.051 --> 01:15:20.884
<v Speaker 2>let's carry on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you had done on some sort of </v>

1608
01:15:22.340 --> 01:15:23.173
<v Speaker 2>medication,</v>
<v Speaker 2>said I was on Zyprexa for 10 years </v>

1609
01:15:25.121 --> 01:15:29.760
<v Speaker 2>because I had an episode where I thought</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a poached egg for a few weeks that</v>

1610
01:15:30.090 --> 01:15:32.640
<v Speaker 2>she would've said she would have said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1611
01:15:32.641 --> 01:15:34.570
<v Speaker 2>well good luck with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1612
01:15:35.260 --> 01:15:36.093
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't let the door hit you on the way </v>

1613
01:15:36.761 --> 01:15:38.020
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

1614
01:15:38.021 --> 01:15:40.600
<v Speaker 2>So they're not interested in treating </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that have had treatment?</v>

1615
01:15:40.630 --> 01:15:41.463
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1616
01:15:41.470 --> 01:15:42.240
<v Speaker 2>that's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1617
01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:43.690
<v Speaker 2>they say good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1618
01:15:44.190 --> 01:15:45.580
<v Speaker 2>tough break on this live.</v>

1619
01:15:45.580 --> 01:15:50.440
<v Speaker 2>Good luck in your next life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They really check that.</v>

1620
01:15:50.500 --> 01:15:52.870
<v Speaker 2>But I'm pretty sure that's the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh man,</v>

1621
01:15:52.900 --> 01:15:53.733
<v Speaker 2>that's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's an intro if you want to </v>

1622
01:15:54.761 --> 01:15:55.594
<v Speaker 2>read,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't go into this in the </v>

1623
01:15:56.021 --> 01:15:58.630
<v Speaker 2>documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you can read up on,</v>

1624
01:15:59.290 --> 01:16:00.123
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the Internet and about cases where </v>

1625
01:16:02.141 --> 01:16:06.580
<v Speaker 2>there's been people who had mental </v>
<v Speaker 2>illness either within scientology,</v>

1626
01:16:06.581 --> 01:16:07.414
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>perhaps the most famous scandal within </v>

1627
01:16:09.461 --> 01:16:14.461
<v Speaker 2>scientology or the most notorious to </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientology watches was the case of Lisa</v>

1628
01:16:15.490 --> 01:16:16.360
<v Speaker 2>Mcpherson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know about her?</v>

1629
01:16:16.450 --> 01:16:17.650
<v Speaker 2>She's the one that died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1630
01:16:17.670 --> 01:16:20.500
<v Speaker 2>she's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's done in detail in,</v>

1631
01:16:20.501 --> 01:16:22.120
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>inside scientology.</v>

1632
01:16:22.121 --> 01:16:25.390
<v Speaker 2>And the Janet Reitman book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was a paid up scientologists.</v>

1633
01:16:25.391 --> 01:16:26.800
<v Speaker 2>Took it very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very seriously.</v>

1634
01:16:26.801 --> 01:16:29.810
<v Speaker 2>A young woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe 30 and um,</v>

1635
01:16:29.830 --> 01:16:30.663
<v Speaker 2>she had a psychotic episode in Florida </v>
<v Speaker 2>and instead of being taken for a given </v>

1636
01:16:37.810 --> 01:16:38.643
<v Speaker 2>bed care in a facility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was taken by scientologists from a </v>

1637
01:16:42.131 --> 01:16:42.964
<v Speaker 2>hospital and I'm more or less </v>
<v Speaker 2>sequestered in a hotel for a week or </v>

1638
01:16:48.641 --> 01:16:49.474
<v Speaker 2>maybe longer and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and died in the hands of the </v>

1639
01:16:52.541 --> 01:16:54.640
<v Speaker 2>scientology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was the cause of death?</v>

1640
01:16:54.910 --> 01:16:58.360
<v Speaker 2>I believe it was dehydration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should double check on that.</v>

1641
01:16:58.410 --> 01:17:00.550
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a rough way to go.</v>

1642
01:17:01.180 --> 01:17:04.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she'd been having,</v>

1643
01:17:04.630 --> 01:17:06.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>total psychotic break.</v>

1644
01:17:06.250 --> 01:17:10.400
<v Speaker 2>She was attacking people in the who were</v>
<v Speaker 2>attempting to,</v>

1645
01:17:10.490 --> 01:17:11.323
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take care or holding her hostage </v>

1646
01:17:13.011 --> 01:17:16.370
<v Speaker 2>depending on how you define it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1647
01:17:16.940 --> 01:17:17.773
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a whole script that Hubbard </v>

1648
01:17:19.251 --> 01:17:21.110
<v Speaker 2>had for dealing with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1649
01:17:21.740 --> 01:17:24.920
<v Speaker 2>people in psychosis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think it was,</v>

1650
01:17:25.290 --> 01:17:26.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>medically supported.</v>

1651
01:17:26.631 --> 01:17:28.710
<v Speaker 2>It was basically involved ignoring them,</v>

1652
01:17:28.910 --> 01:17:32.180
<v Speaker 1>keeping them secluded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of locking them in a room.</v>

1653
01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:33.793
<v Speaker 1>Now I saw an interview with you where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you were talking about someone who used </v>

1654
01:17:36.021 --> 01:17:38.540
<v Speaker 1>to be a former scientologist a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1655
01:17:38.541 --> 01:17:40.400
<v Speaker 1>she was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she wasn't a former scientologist.</v>

1656
01:17:40.401 --> 01:17:43.070
<v Speaker 1>She had gone undercover to sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>investigate that.</v>

1657
01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:44.513
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were talking about the auditing </v>

1658
01:17:46.850 --> 01:17:48.800
<v Speaker 1>having a positive benefit.</v>

1659
01:17:49.390 --> 01:17:51.490
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it probably does.</v>

1660
01:17:51.491 --> 01:17:53.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think any kind of bolted on,</v>

1661
01:17:53.590 --> 01:17:54.490
<v Speaker 2>on you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1662
01:17:54.491 --> 01:17:56.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the editing I did,</v>

1663
01:17:57.100 --> 01:18:00.490
<v Speaker 2>I only did one session and that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

1664
01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:02.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the main guy in the film.</v>

1665
01:18:03.270 --> 01:18:06.700
<v Speaker 2>It's a guy called Marty Rathbun and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>was in it.</v>

1666
01:18:06.730 --> 01:18:07.563
<v Speaker 2>There's a sense in which the film is as </v>
<v Speaker 2>much about him as it is about </v>

1667
01:18:09.401 --> 01:18:10.450
<v Speaker 2>scientology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>

1668
01:18:10.930 --> 01:18:13.000
<v Speaker 2>he was a Mr. fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Within Scientology,</v>

1669
01:18:13.001 --> 01:18:14.860
<v Speaker 2>he was the number two to David </v>
<v Speaker 2>miscavige.</v>

1670
01:18:14.861 --> 01:18:15.694
<v Speaker 2>David miscavige is the guy who took over</v>
<v Speaker 2>in 1986 or thereabouts from l Ron </v>

1671
01:18:20.260 --> 01:18:21.580
<v Speaker 2>Hubbard and has been running it ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>since.</v>

1672
01:18:21.940 --> 01:18:24.500
<v Speaker 2>He's an unaccountable leader who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1673
01:18:24.570 --> 01:18:26.920
<v Speaker 2>is in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in essence the pope of scientology.</v>

1674
01:18:26.950 --> 01:18:27.783
<v Speaker 2>And there are many allegations of him </v>
<v Speaker 2>being physically abusive towards his </v>

1675
01:18:31.091 --> 01:18:31.924
<v Speaker 2>followers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Marty Rathmann was his right hand man </v>

1676
01:18:33.611 --> 01:18:34.444
<v Speaker 2>for many years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Marty Rathman left in 2004 or </v>

1677
01:18:36.350 --> 01:18:38.280
<v Speaker 2>thereabouts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was so,</v>

1678
01:18:38.290 --> 01:18:39.123
<v Speaker 2>he sort of our deep throat in the film,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he also cops to the fact that when </v>

1679
01:18:43.031 --> 01:18:43.864
<v Speaker 2>he was in scientology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was involved in all kinds of devious </v>

1680
01:18:48.100 --> 01:18:52.450
<v Speaker 2>covert activity involving a private </v>
<v Speaker 2>investigators,</v>

1681
01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:55.210
<v Speaker 2>destruction of documents.</v>

1682
01:18:55.270 --> 01:18:59.050
<v Speaker 2>And I'm also certain amount of physical </v>
<v Speaker 2>violence himself,</v>

1683
01:18:59.230 --> 01:19:02.470
<v Speaker 2>which he has apologized for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he,</v>

1684
01:19:02.471 --> 01:19:03.304
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it becomes a sort of examination of him </v>

1685
01:19:05.291 --> 01:19:06.124
<v Speaker 2>and his ability to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that he's been seduced by this </v>

1686
01:19:09.641 --> 01:19:12.820
<v Speaker 2>thing and it's still in certain ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's still in him,</v>

1687
01:19:12.850 --> 01:19:13.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by,</v>

1688
01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:15.190
<v Speaker 2>by almost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by definition,</v>

1689
01:19:15.191 --> 01:19:17.110
<v Speaker 2>you can't be in something that long and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1690
01:19:17.660 --> 01:19:20.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Leah Remini was a celebrity parishioner,</v>

1691
01:19:20.111 --> 01:19:20.944
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was,</v>

1692
01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:22.710
<v Speaker 2>she was going around the celebrity </v>
<v Speaker 2>century,</v>

1693
01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:25.240
<v Speaker 2>was doing scientology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she was not in the CEO.</v>

1694
01:19:25.300 --> 01:19:26.133
<v Speaker 2>The CEO gets this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Clergy is the intersect is the </v>

1695
01:19:27.551 --> 01:19:31.750
<v Speaker 2>difference between someone who goes to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>Catholic church a few times a year,</v>

1696
01:19:31.751 --> 01:19:35.500
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And eats communion and thinks and praise</v>

1697
01:19:35.501 --> 01:19:37.060
<v Speaker 2>a few times you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's okay.</v>

1698
01:19:37.061 --> 01:19:39.070
<v Speaker 2>You can be a scientologist in that way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1699
01:19:39.730 --> 01:19:42.190
<v Speaker 2>Which maybe your neighbor was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you're in the seal,</v>

1700
01:19:42.220 --> 01:19:45.130
<v Speaker 2>it's somewhere between being in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Vatican and being a monk.</v>

1701
01:19:45.190 --> 01:19:48.010
<v Speaker 2>You take a vow of poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you volunteer,</v>

1702
01:19:48.011 --> 01:19:49.490
<v Speaker 2>you think about poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1703
01:19:49.750 --> 01:19:52.930
<v Speaker 2>You get paid below minimum wage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tiny amounts.</v>

1704
01:19:52.931 --> 01:19:53.764
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're leading a kind of Spartan </v>

1705
01:19:54.880 --> 01:19:58.870
<v Speaker 2>existence to save the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You sign a contract for 40 billion years</v>

1706
01:19:58.871 --> 01:19:59.704
<v Speaker 2>or something I think is interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's supposed to cover all your </v>

1707
01:20:01.541 --> 01:20:04.030
<v Speaker 2>future lifetimes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so when you come back,</v>

1708
01:20:04.031 --> 01:20:06.480
<v Speaker 2>you're still in the sea org.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're um,</v>

1709
01:20:07.660 --> 01:20:12.000
<v Speaker 2>their slogan is something I vein our </v>
<v Speaker 2>business or whatever the Latin is,</v>

1710
01:20:12.001 --> 01:20:12.834
<v Speaker 2>it's we come back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning that we come back in future </v>

1711
01:20:15.421 --> 01:20:18.270
<v Speaker 2>lifetimes and we're still going to be in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sea org anyway.</v>

1712
01:20:18.630 --> 01:20:20.730
<v Speaker 2>So it's really important to get that </v>
<v Speaker 2>distinction because,</v>

1713
01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:22.433
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't want people to have the </v>

1714
01:20:23.311 --> 01:20:27.930
<v Speaker 2>impression that everyone in scientology </v>
<v Speaker 2>is sort of going around in a uniform,</v>

1715
01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:32.730
<v Speaker 2>marching around in a vow of poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just the seal guys.</v>

1716
01:20:32.731 --> 01:20:34.140
<v Speaker 2>And most of them live down.</v>

1717
01:20:34.380 --> 01:20:37.050
<v Speaker 2>Many of them lived down in Hemet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>outside La,</v>

1718
01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:42.560
<v Speaker 2>and that's where it's outside is if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>had towards palm springs,</v>

1719
01:20:42.661 --> 01:20:44.550
<v Speaker 2>basically it's in the desert.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where they live.</v>

1720
01:20:44.610 --> 01:20:45.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a pace down,</v>

1721
01:20:46.140 --> 01:20:46.973
<v Speaker 2>although they have some giant center </v>
<v Speaker 2>down there that they're going to start </v>

1722
01:20:48.781 --> 01:20:49.890
<v Speaker 2>producing movies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1723
01:20:49.980 --> 01:20:52.890
<v Speaker 2>Well that there's a center in Hollywood </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they've just bought.</v>

1724
01:20:52.930 --> 01:20:53.731
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've just,</v>

1725
01:20:53.731 --> 01:20:54.481
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just bought,</v>

1726
01:20:54.481 --> 01:20:56.700
<v Speaker 2>they're just refurbed it and they've </v>
<v Speaker 2>opened it.</v>

1727
01:20:56.880 --> 01:21:00.010
<v Speaker 2>And they're going to open it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is bizarre because they have it.</v>

1728
01:21:00.020 --> 01:21:00.853
<v Speaker 2>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1729
01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:01.873
<v Speaker 2>Thirty dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>million dollar TV studio movie and TV </v>

1730
01:21:04.021 --> 01:21:06.070
<v Speaker 2>Studio Complex in Hollywood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That just opened the.</v>

1731
01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:08.400
<v Speaker 2>But they have a complex in Hemet as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1732
01:21:08.610 --> 01:21:09.443
<v Speaker 2>bizarrely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know why they need another </v>

1733
01:21:10.681 --> 01:21:11.514
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They like buying shit apparently at one </v>

1734
01:21:13.831 --> 01:21:17.220
<v Speaker 2>point in time they were the number two </v>
<v Speaker 2>real estate holders in Los Angeles.</v>

1735
01:21:17.510 --> 01:21:18.270
<v Speaker 2>Well that.</v>

1736
01:21:18.270 --> 01:21:19.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1737
01:21:19.381 --> 01:21:21.930
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's actually maybe Hollywood.</v>

1738
01:21:21.990 --> 01:21:23.040
<v Speaker 2>Not necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe,</v>

1739
01:21:23.190 --> 01:21:24.060
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1740
01:21:24.300 --> 01:21:24.691
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1741
01:21:24.691 --> 01:21:25.524
<v Speaker 2>but the um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think a lot of that is to do with </v>

1742
01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:28.673
<v Speaker 2>someone explained this to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the rules about a nonprofit or </v>

1743
01:21:31.531 --> 01:21:32.364
<v Speaker 2>about being a religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having their religious status is they </v>

1744
01:21:34.681 --> 01:21:38.850
<v Speaker 2>cannot hold their income,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like money that comes in has to be spent</v>

1745
01:21:38.851 --> 01:21:42.030
<v Speaker 2>otherwise they're in violation of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>charitable status.</v>

1746
01:21:42.390 --> 01:21:44.780
<v Speaker 2>So this is this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone just told me this,</v>

1747
01:21:44.781 --> 01:21:45.750
<v Speaker 2>the other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in other words,</v>

1748
01:21:45.770 --> 01:21:46.603
<v Speaker 2>it's in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to kind of keep buying </v>

1749
01:21:47.911 --> 01:21:50.640
<v Speaker 2>buildings because there needs to be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>cash outflow,</v>

1750
01:21:52.370 --> 01:21:53.580
<v Speaker 2>which sort of makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1751
01:21:53.581 --> 01:21:55.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's totally understandable.</v>

1752
01:21:55.710 --> 01:21:56.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes sense.</v>

1753
01:21:57.360 --> 01:21:58.440
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1754
01:21:58.540 --> 01:21:59.373
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1755
01:21:59.400 --> 01:21:59.940
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1756
01:21:59.940 --> 01:22:02.340
<v Speaker 2>so this Guy Marty rathbone who sort of </v>

<v Speaker 3>That's what I have every morning.</v>

1831
01:25:21.731 --> 01:25:22.564
<v Speaker 3>What is the most qualified mct oil?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mct oil that you can mix very easily </v>

1832
01:25:26.531 --> 01:25:30.940
<v Speaker 3>with cold beverages or is mct oil or </v>
<v Speaker 3>medium chain triglyceride oil?</v>

1833
01:25:30.941 --> 01:25:35.380
<v Speaker 3>It's the most nutritious aspects of </v>
<v Speaker 3>coconut oil that are blended together.</v>

1834
01:25:35.381 --> 01:25:39.310
<v Speaker 3>IT's they spin in a centrifuge extract </v>
<v Speaker 3>the bushel.</v>

1835
01:25:41.750 --> 01:25:45.580
<v Speaker 3>You can get it anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mct oil is readily available at any,</v>

1836
01:25:46.540 --> 01:25:47.373
<v Speaker 3>any sort of health food store and a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of erewhon and whole foods and those </v>

1837
01:25:50.891 --> 01:25:52.840
<v Speaker 3>types of places carry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never even heard of it.</v>

1838
01:25:52.900 --> 01:25:53.950
<v Speaker 3>Can you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have coconut oil,</v>

1839
01:25:53.951 --> 01:25:54.640
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1840
01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:55.473
<v Speaker 3>It's their.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're healthy fats that are really </v>

1841
01:25:56.921 --> 01:25:58.510
<v Speaker 3>good for your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good stuff.</v>

1842
01:25:58.550 --> 01:26:00.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it morning thunder,</v>

1843
01:26:00.820 --> 01:26:01.653
<v Speaker 3>the point being it off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what a cop cop as chairman of the </v>

1844
01:26:08.331 --> 01:26:09.164
<v Speaker 3>board.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>

1845
01:26:10.330 --> 01:26:11.860
<v Speaker 3>there we go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cop rtc,</v>

1846
01:26:12.870 --> 01:26:15.440
<v Speaker 3>there's cob and then there's me and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's glib,</v>

1847
01:26:16.840 --> 01:26:17.450
<v Speaker 3>glib,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nicholas,</v>

1848
01:26:17.450 --> 01:26:19.620
<v Speaker 3>matt lauer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then there's ciantra fault.</v>

1849
01:26:19.621 --> 01:26:20.454
<v Speaker 3>It just below matt lauer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they have quite dim view of john </v>

1850
01:26:22.281 --> 01:26:23.910
<v Speaker 3>travolta within science.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

1851
01:26:24.180 --> 01:26:26.720
<v Speaker 3>why this is such.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is called a bud fucking.</v>

1852
01:26:27.770 --> 01:26:30.610
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think massage viewed,</v>

1853
01:26:30.660 --> 01:26:31.980
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Marty raspbian top.</v>

1854
01:26:32.060 --> 01:26:34.010
<v Speaker 3>That's allegedly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can I throw an allegedly,</v>

1855
01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:36.020
<v Speaker 3>allegedly they have a bad view of him.</v>

1856
01:26:36.210 --> 01:26:38.870
<v Speaker 3>Just pause everything now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of what I'm saying,</v>

1857
01:26:38.871 --> 01:26:40.550
<v Speaker 3>it's based on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once he blew,</v>

1858
01:26:40.551 --> 01:26:41.384
<v Speaker 3>once he left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>marty rathbun spilled his guts on the </v>

1859
01:26:43.881 --> 01:26:44.714
<v Speaker 3>internet in all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1860
01:26:44.810 --> 01:26:45.643
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in order to let people know what was </v>

1861
01:26:49.221 --> 01:26:50.054
<v Speaker 3>going on and he kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was the biggest thing I would say in </v>

1862
01:26:53.900 --> 01:26:57.230
<v Speaker 3>sort of in terms of exposing scientology</v>
<v Speaker 3>for what it is,</v>

1863
01:26:57.350 --> 01:27:00.140
<v Speaker 3>probably more probably in the history of</v>
<v Speaker 3>scientology.</v>

1864
01:27:00.410 --> 01:27:01.243
<v Speaker 3>John travolta's wife was on fear factor </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I got to meet john travolta because </v>

1865
01:27:03.861 --> 01:27:06.200
<v Speaker 3>his wife was in the finals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She lost coolio.</v>

1866
01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:10.010
<v Speaker 3>Who was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

1867
01:27:10.190 --> 01:27:11.023
<v Speaker 3>you want to talk about a guy who </v>
<v Speaker 3>performs very well under the influence </v>

1868
01:27:13.431 --> 01:27:14.264
<v Speaker 3>of marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Coolio might be at the top of my list </v>

1869
01:27:16.041 --> 01:27:17.480
<v Speaker 3>right there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right up there with joey diaz,</v>

1870
01:27:17.990 --> 01:27:18.870
<v Speaker 3>coolio,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1871
01:27:18.920 --> 01:27:19.753
<v Speaker 3>where they would open up his trailer and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like a cheech and chong and it </v>

1872
01:27:22.221 --> 01:27:23.054
<v Speaker 3>was hilarious and he would go out there </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he would perform these stocks just </v>

1873
01:27:26.541 --> 01:27:27.830
<v Speaker 3>high as a kite.</v>

1874
01:27:28.250 --> 01:27:29.083
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just gone because you look in his eyes </v>

1875
01:27:31.500 --> 01:27:34.190
<v Speaker 3>were just glazed over and he would </v>
<v Speaker 3>perform flawlessly.</v>

1876
01:27:34.370 --> 01:27:37.610
<v Speaker 3>And the last stunt involved balance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was his balance thing.</v>

1877
01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:38.713
<v Speaker 3>And I had a conversation with him before</v>
<v Speaker 3>we did it and I was a unfortunately </v>

1878
01:27:41.301 --> 01:27:43.760
<v Speaker 3>stone cold sober at the time I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1901
01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:41.660
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

1906
01:28:51.381 --> 01:28:52.214
<v Speaker 3>my neighbor who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my former neighbor many years ago was a </v>

1907
01:28:53.931 --> 01:28:54.764
<v Speaker 3>very nice guy and I've met a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientologists inside of hollywood and </v>

1908
01:28:59.541 --> 01:29:00.374
<v Speaker 3>they all have actory thing going on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is I would like to believe that </v>

1909
01:29:06.121 --> 01:29:07.830
<v Speaker 3>they are as nice as they are pretending </v>
<v Speaker 3>to me,</v>

1910
01:29:07.831 --> 01:29:09.560
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

1911
01:29:09.570 --> 01:29:11.670
<v Speaker 3>Then actory thing like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

1912
01:29:11.671 --> 01:29:12.740
<v Speaker 3>aNd I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1913
01:29:12.870 --> 01:29:13.703
<v Speaker 3>I know one of my early experiences when </v>
<v Speaker 3>I was talking to a scientologist when I </v>

1914
01:29:17.341 --> 01:29:22.341
<v Speaker 3>was trying to first negotiate access to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the church bacK in 2003 was I'd sent her</v>

1915
01:29:23.461 --> 01:29:27.610
<v Speaker 3>some old documentaries that I'd done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so this is who I am,</v>

1916
01:29:27.611 --> 01:29:30.060
<v Speaker 3>this is what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she was on the phone.</v>

1917
01:29:30.090 --> 01:29:31.860
<v Speaker 3>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>

1918
01:29:31.861 --> 01:29:32.694
<v Speaker 3>I got the dvds and watching.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she started laughing in the act of </v>

1919
01:29:38.130 --> 01:29:40.590
<v Speaker 3>talking about liKe a fake laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1920
01:29:40.591 --> 01:29:42.060
<v Speaker 3>And I say that didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1921
01:29:42.061 --> 01:29:44.820
<v Speaker 3>that didn't feel quite real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Later on,</v>

1922
01:29:44.821 --> 01:29:45.654
<v Speaker 3>another person I knew who was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientologist did the same thing where </v>

1923
01:29:48.031 --> 01:29:53.031
<v Speaker 3>like I saw the thing you did on that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>a desert pet peeve of mine.</v>

1924
01:29:54.091 --> 01:29:54.841
<v Speaker 3>I Was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh wow,</v>

1925
01:29:54.841 --> 01:29:56.070
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a giant,</v>

1926
01:29:56.310 --> 01:29:57.143
<v Speaker 3>maybe that's part of what they do is </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of a similar kind of weird love </v>

1927
01:29:59.941 --> 01:30:00.774
<v Speaker 3>bombing.</v>

1928
01:30:00.870 --> 01:30:02.700
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that was just coincidence.</v>

1929
01:30:02.710 --> 01:30:06.060
<v Speaker 3>It makes sense because they're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be influential and they're trying to.</v>

1930
01:30:06.120 --> 01:30:08.790
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to be charming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1931
01:30:09.590 --> 01:30:12.690
<v Speaker 3>I find a lot of the scientologists that </v>
<v Speaker 3>I've met that are actors,</v>

1932
01:30:13.330 --> 01:30:14.520
<v Speaker 3>they're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're extremely charming.</v>

1933
01:30:14.521 --> 01:30:15.840
<v Speaker 3>Like there's one of the things you hear </v>
<v Speaker 3>about tom cruise.</v>

1934
01:30:15.841 --> 01:30:17.630
<v Speaker 3>He looks you in the eye.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He talks to you.</v>

1935
01:30:17.680 --> 01:30:20.790
<v Speaker 3>Remember,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm make sure that's true.</v>

1936
01:30:20.791 --> 01:30:22.230
<v Speaker 3>I mean they drill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as I said,</v>

1937
01:30:22.231 --> 01:30:23.064
<v Speaker 3>they drill on looking people in the eye,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but let's just assume that that's his </v>

1938
01:30:26.071 --> 01:30:27.570
<v Speaker 3>real behavior pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

1939
01:30:27.571 --> 01:30:29.320
<v Speaker 3>It's a very good behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nice.</v>

1940
01:30:29.880 --> 01:30:30.713
<v Speaker 3>I'm in favor of positivity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although I think the world needs </v>

1941
01:30:32.650 --> 01:30:33.483
<v Speaker 3>negative people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think there need to be some what </v>

1942
01:30:36.450 --> 01:30:37.860
<v Speaker 3>do you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But wait a minute,</v>

1943
01:30:37.861 --> 01:30:41.010
<v Speaker 3>but the whole part of the ecology of </v>
<v Speaker 3>life is to have been in the yang.</v>

1944
01:30:41.140 --> 01:30:43.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The one was positive then.</v>

1945
01:30:43.900 --> 01:30:46.290
<v Speaker 3>I mean it would be a little too much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1946
01:30:46.320 --> 01:30:49.350
<v Speaker 3>it would be very strange if the world </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't become enlightened.</v>

1947
01:30:49.620 --> 01:30:52.950
<v Speaker 3>Like what if some pharmaceutical company</v>
<v Speaker 3>device,</v>

1948
01:30:52.951 --> 01:30:55.780
<v Speaker 3>some pill that eliminates all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>negative aspects of humanity,</v>

1949
01:30:55.781 --> 01:30:57.740
<v Speaker 3>so we all just started taking it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1950
01:30:57.960 --> 01:30:59.490
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look how many people brush their teeth.</v>

1951
01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:00.540
<v Speaker 3>pretty much everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1952
01:31:00.750 --> 01:31:01.583
<v Speaker 3>What if everybody started doing whatever</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is and this new thing which </v>

1953
01:31:04.861 --> 01:31:07.410
<v Speaker 3>eliminated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>became prevalent throughout the world.</v>

1954
01:31:07.411 --> 01:31:09.450
<v Speaker 3>Eliminate like vaccinations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1955
01:31:09.720 --> 01:31:11.330
<v Speaker 3>Pretty much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would.</v>

1956
01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:12.193
<v Speaker 3>I would have some at high,</v>
<v Speaker 3>90 percent of the western world is </v>

1957
01:31:15.031 --> 01:31:18.930
<v Speaker 3>vaccinated every now and then our meat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some kid who had hippie parents and they</v>

1958
01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:21.770
<v Speaker 3>gave him apple cider vinegar and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>never vaccinated them.</v>

1959
01:31:21.790 --> 01:31:22.690
<v Speaker 3>There's those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>

1960
01:31:22.700 --> 01:31:24.600
<v Speaker 3>a few of those exist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for the most part,</v>

1961
01:31:24.601 --> 01:31:27.750
<v Speaker 3>most people are vaccinated to prevent </v>
<v Speaker 3>against diseases.</v>

1962
01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:29.153
<v Speaker 3>If we came up with some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>vaccination to prevent the more </v>

1963
01:31:33.990 --> 01:31:38.160
<v Speaker 3>disgusting aspects of human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>negative behavior or aggression,</v>

1964
01:31:38.161 --> 01:31:40.080
<v Speaker 3>meanness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'd be very curious.</v>

1965
01:31:40.081 --> 01:31:41.700
<v Speaker 3>Very curious as to how that would play </v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

1966
01:31:41.880 --> 01:31:46.880
<v Speaker 3>Whether or not that would diminish a </v>
<v Speaker 3>ambition and progress and who knows.</v>

1967
01:31:49.890 --> 01:31:51.540
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was.</v>

1968
01:31:51.570 --> 01:31:53.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought you said the yin and the yang.</v>

1969
01:31:53.370 --> 01:31:56.520
<v Speaker 3>I think scientology aspires to be that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1970
01:31:56.560 --> 01:31:59.680
<v Speaker 3>and I think the danger of it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1971
01:31:59.740 --> 01:32:00.140
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1972
01:32:00.140 --> 01:32:00.710
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1973
01:32:00.710 --> 01:32:05.710
<v Speaker 2>it would be certain similarities to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of almost fascist vision.</v>

1974
01:32:06.070 --> 01:32:07.090
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1975
01:32:07.091 --> 01:32:10.030
<v Speaker 2>I think that there is an overlap there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1976
01:32:10.031 --> 01:32:13.150
<v Speaker 2>the cult of health,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the culture of glowing,</v>

1977
01:32:13.151 --> 01:32:13.984
<v Speaker 2>smiling beacons of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of health and humanity marching up and </v>

1978
01:32:17.351 --> 01:32:18.184
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And actually it's our ability to rub </v>

1979
01:32:20.021 --> 01:32:24.210
<v Speaker 2>along with difficult characters and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

1980
01:32:24.330 --> 01:32:28.280
<v Speaker 2>to sort of embraced the ugly side is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>iron.</v>

1981
01:32:28.300 --> 01:32:29.133
<v Speaker 2>Can't define exactly what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it feels like that's an important </v>

1982
01:32:31.390 --> 01:32:32.440
<v Speaker 2>dimension of life.</v>

1983
01:32:32.650 --> 01:32:35.050
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it certainly seems to be that there's a,</v>

1984
01:32:35.051 --> 01:32:35.884
<v Speaker 1>there's a dynamic that plays out between</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings and that we learn not just </v>

1985
01:32:40.571 --> 01:32:42.850
<v Speaker 1>from the positives but also from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>negatives.</v>

1986
01:32:42.851 --> 01:32:45.940
<v Speaker 1>And I learned a lot from other people's </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative behavior,</v>

1987
01:32:45.941 --> 01:32:49.300
<v Speaker 1>how to never be like that myself without</v>
<v Speaker 1>having to make those same mistakes.</v>

1988
01:32:49.570 --> 01:32:51.790
<v Speaker 1>Also learned from my own mistakes of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

1989
01:32:52.180 --> 01:32:55.600
<v Speaker 1>But when we see horrible things in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>news and negative things,</v>

1990
01:32:55.601 --> 01:32:56.434
<v Speaker 1>I think that does sort of reinforce how </v>
<v Speaker 1>fortunate you are that you're not </v>

1991
01:32:59.411 --> 01:33:00.244
<v Speaker 1>experiencing those horrible things and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there is some sort of an </v>

1992
01:33:03.101 --> 01:33:07.120
<v Speaker 1>understanding of the worst aspects of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people wear it.</v>

1993
01:33:07.130 --> 01:33:09.250
<v Speaker 1>It Broadens your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your spectrum of patients.</v>

1994
01:33:09.640 --> 01:33:10.473
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I also think that many of my </v>

1995
01:33:11.821 --> 01:33:12.654
<v Speaker 2>favorite writers you would probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>defined in some sense as a walking </v>

1996
01:33:16.951 --> 01:33:20.010
<v Speaker 2>negative side of life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about hunter thompson,</v>

1997
01:33:20.310 --> 01:33:21.780
<v Speaker 2>thompson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>william burroughs,</v>

1998
01:33:21.781 --> 01:33:22.790
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1999
01:33:22.830 --> 01:33:24.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for them anyway,</v>

2000
01:33:24.390 --> 01:33:25.223
<v Speaker 2>Philip Roth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you like the talking about the </v>

2001
01:33:28.141 --> 01:33:31.500
<v Speaker 2>absolute most contemptible and </v>
<v Speaker 2>disgusting impulses,</v>

2002
01:33:31.501 --> 01:33:33.840
<v Speaker 2>we feel bukowski.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2003
01:33:33.890 --> 01:33:34.910
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2004
01:33:35.050 --> 01:33:37.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's absolutely rambo,</v>

2005
01:33:37.441 --> 01:33:38.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the french poet,</v>

2006
01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:42.120
<v Speaker 2>this is sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is who we are.</v>

2007
01:33:42.121 --> 01:33:44.660
<v Speaker 2>This is the stuff of life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ineradicable.</v>

2008
01:33:44.670 --> 01:33:47.300
<v Speaker 2>And I think I'm suspicious of anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2009
01:33:47.480 --> 01:33:48.241
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2010
01:33:48.241 --> 01:33:51.030
<v Speaker 2>that pathologizes it too much and says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

2011
01:33:51.031 --> 01:33:53.340
<v Speaker 2>that's sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2012
01:33:53.850 --> 01:33:54.571
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you know,</v>

2013
01:33:54.571 --> 01:33:55.920
<v Speaker 2>which scientology does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

2014
01:33:55.930 --> 01:33:59.370
<v Speaker 2>they say that's your reactive mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a malfunctioning part of your mind.</v>

2015
01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:02.280
<v Speaker 2>It's a pseudo scientific thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas actually christianity,</v>

2016
01:34:02.281 --> 01:34:03.114
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a christian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it sort of embraces the fact that </v>

2017
01:34:05.341 --> 01:34:07.290
<v Speaker 2>it's just your human side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2018
01:34:07.291 --> 01:34:08.124
<v Speaker 2>your human side is his earthly and </v>
<v Speaker 2>twisted and sexual and and actually you </v>

2019
01:34:12.571 --> 01:34:15.210
<v Speaker 2>need to embrace some sort of high empire</v>
<v Speaker 2>being well,</v>

2020
01:34:15.410 --> 01:34:18.780
<v Speaker 1>I think most religions or ideologies </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are,</v>

2021
01:34:19.190 --> 01:34:22.670
<v Speaker 1>that are trying to promote some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>advancement.</v>

2022
01:34:23.060 --> 01:34:28.060
<v Speaker 1>They look to the past and to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>horrific nature of animal behavior,</v>

2023
01:34:28.760 --> 01:34:29.593
<v Speaker 1>the tooth fang and claw of the wild and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the recognition that somehow or another </v>

2024
01:34:33.021 --> 01:34:36.050
<v Speaker 1>we've emerged from that and that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspire to do better.</v>

2025
01:34:36.410 --> 01:34:38.960
<v Speaker 1>And then that we know that in our own </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>

2026
01:34:38.961 --> 01:34:41.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you look at your own life as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>microcosm,</v>

2027
01:34:41.500 --> 01:34:42.171
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2028
01:34:42.171 --> 01:34:43.004
<v Speaker 1>you've sort of fIgured out what you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>done wrong hopefully and have advanced </v>

2029
01:34:48.410 --> 01:34:53.410
<v Speaker 1>past those days of youth and foolish </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior and you're now wiser,</v>

2030
01:34:53.570 --> 01:34:56.990
<v Speaker 1>more educated person and you seek to </v>
<v Speaker 1>continue to advance,</v>

2031
01:34:57.110 --> 01:34:57.943
<v Speaker 1>continue to do better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's sort of like it's all analogous </v>

2032
01:35:00.501 --> 01:35:03.430
<v Speaker 1>at all sort of ties in together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now when,</v>

2033
01:35:03.500 --> 01:35:06.340
<v Speaker 1>when people go too hard with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

2034
01:35:06.341 --> 01:35:10.160
<v Speaker 1>when people to go to hard with </v>
<v Speaker 1>eliMinating the bad behavior,</v>

2035
01:35:10.161 --> 01:35:13.160
<v Speaker 1>I always wonDer if like l ron hubbard </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself,</v>

2036
01:35:13.460 --> 01:35:14.750
<v Speaker 1>if he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2037
01:35:14.751 --> 01:35:15.584
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we talk about him self-diaGnosing </v>

2038
01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:19.880
<v Speaker 1>and self-treating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's what they're doing as well,</v>

2039
01:35:19.900 --> 01:35:20.733
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know that like isn't an old </v>

2040
01:35:22.461 --> 01:35:24.860
<v Speaker 1>expression that a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2041
01:35:24.861 --> 01:35:27.830
<v Speaker 1>there's an old thing that you see with </v>
<v Speaker 1>women,</v>

2042
01:35:28.280 --> 01:35:29.300
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are,</v>

2043
01:35:29.370 --> 01:35:33.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the best way to put this sexually</v>

2044
01:35:33.531 --> 01:35:34.364
<v Speaker 1>loose that they always like to point the</v>
<v Speaker 1>finger at other girls that are sexually </v>

2045
01:35:37.731 --> 01:35:38.564
<v Speaker 1>loose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like one of the first indications </v>

2046
01:35:40.191 --> 01:35:43.890
<v Speaker 1>that girl might be a slut is that she </v>
<v Speaker 1>likes to point at other girls and,</v>

2047
01:35:44.020 --> 01:35:44.853
<v Speaker 1>and that's a real common thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that the things that annoy </v>

2048
01:35:49.731 --> 01:35:54.731
<v Speaker 1>you the most about yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you tend to highlight those aspects when</v>

2049
01:35:56.511 --> 01:35:59.630
<v Speaker 1>you discuss human beings or other people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that irritate you.</v>

2050
01:35:59.770 --> 01:36:04.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure that something in that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

2051
01:36:04.240 --> 01:36:05.440
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

2052
01:36:05.470 --> 01:36:07.480
<v Speaker 2>my dad likes to quote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

2053
01:36:07.481 --> 01:36:08.560
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

2054
01:36:08.561 --> 01:36:11.420
<v Speaker 2>a bulgarian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>last and radical.</v>

2055
01:36:11.430 --> 01:36:14.920
<v Speaker 2>The lights can net huge had enough </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason that the thieves hell is the fear</v>

2056
01:36:14.921 --> 01:36:15.754
<v Speaker 2>of thieves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we sort of project our qualities to </v>

2057
01:36:18.041 --> 01:36:18.874
<v Speaker 2>others and it fills us with anxiety that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they may be that I have to go to the </v>

2058
01:36:23.180 --> 01:36:24.140
<v Speaker 2>other point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>know though,</v>

2059
01:36:24.330 --> 01:36:27.640
<v Speaker 2>it would be wonderful to feel that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>advanced through life acquiring wisdom.</v>

2060
01:36:28.180 --> 01:36:30.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that it's necessarily the </v>
<v Speaker 2>case.</v>

2061
01:36:30.131 --> 01:36:33.700
<v Speaker 2>And what strikes me about hubbard is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2062
01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:34.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2063
01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:35.473
<v Speaker 2>the merit that you see in scientology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The bits that feel workable and make </v>

2064
01:36:38.651 --> 01:36:41.050
<v Speaker 2>sense seem to have come out fairly early</v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

2065
01:36:41.110 --> 01:36:41.943
<v Speaker 2>And then later on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the stuff that was coming out with more </v>

2066
01:36:44.471 --> 01:36:45.304
<v Speaker 2>and more outlandish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever therapies he was evolving it </v>

2067
01:36:47.861 --> 01:36:48.694
<v Speaker 2>when it went to the ot levels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was really getting properly out </v>

2068
01:36:52.481 --> 01:36:53.314
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2069
01:36:53.660 --> 01:36:55.520
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2070
01:36:55.880 --> 01:36:58.000
<v Speaker 2>whether that may be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was spiraling out.</v>

2071
01:36:58.030 --> 01:36:58.863
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's allegations that he was fully </v>

2072
01:37:01.570 --> 01:37:03.160
<v Speaker 2>mentally ill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2073
01:37:03.240 --> 01:37:05.620
<v Speaker 2>at least four episodes towards the end </v>
<v Speaker 2>of his life.</v>

2074
01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:06.513
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2075
01:37:06.930 --> 01:37:07.763
<v Speaker 1>we spent a great deal of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sea org was kind of concocted </v>

2076
01:37:09.901 --> 01:37:12.310
<v Speaker 1>because he had to be in the ocean.</v>

2077
01:37:12.510 --> 01:37:14.190
<v Speaker 2>He had to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

2078
01:37:14.370 --> 01:37:16.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm away from America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he went.</v>

2079
01:37:16.621 --> 01:37:20.390
<v Speaker 2>He took to s to the sea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so didn't prosecuted basically,</v>

2080
01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:21.720
<v Speaker 2>as I understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2081
01:37:21.721 --> 01:37:22.554
<v Speaker 2>And so he had a sort of ocean going </v>
<v Speaker 2>religion where they were kind of </v>

2082
01:37:26.401 --> 01:37:27.234
<v Speaker 2>traveling around and then for a while he</v>
<v Speaker 2>was in england and then for a while he </v>

2083
01:37:29.131 --> 01:37:29.964
<v Speaker 2>was in what was then rhodesia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is now is involved way sort of </v>

2084
01:37:33.181 --> 01:37:34.014
<v Speaker 2>trying to find a niche,</v>
<v Speaker 2>find a kind of new frontier that he </v>

2085
01:37:36.601 --> 01:37:40.800
<v Speaker 2>could more or less make for his own kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of claim for scientology.</v>

2086
01:37:40.980 --> 01:37:41.813
<v Speaker 2>But then even when he came back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was so caught up In lawsuits in the </v>

2087
01:37:45.870 --> 01:37:48.930
<v Speaker 2>last 10 or 15 years of his life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People pursuing him,</v>

2088
01:37:48.980 --> 01:37:51.000
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for money because they,</v>

2089
01:37:51.570 --> 01:37:52.403
<v Speaker 2>they felt scientology had made them </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychotic or they just thought it </v>

2090
01:37:55.110 --> 01:37:55.980
<v Speaker 2>fraudulent or</v>

2091
01:37:55.980 --> 01:37:56.813
<v Speaker 3>that they wanted their money back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had to disappear and was living in </v>

2092
01:37:59.761 --> 01:38:00.594
<v Speaker 3>seclusion more or less hiding out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>while money was kind of shuttled back </v>

2093
01:38:05.581 --> 01:38:06.414
<v Speaker 3>and forth to him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's why I say I said at the </v>

2094
01:38:08.191 --> 01:38:09.024
<v Speaker 3>beginning of the problem with </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientology is an overabundance of </v>

2095
01:38:11.131 --> 01:38:13.590
<v Speaker 3>material.</v>
<v Speaker 3>you probably saw the master right to the</v>

2096
01:38:13.591 --> 01:38:17.700
<v Speaker 3>Paul Thomas Anderson film had fell </v>
<v Speaker 3>asleep as watching it in a hotel room.</v>

2097
01:38:17.701 --> 01:38:19.920
<v Speaker 3>And I passed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it had its moments,</v>

2098
01:38:19.921 --> 01:38:20.754
<v Speaker 3>but there's so many weird stories within</v>
<v Speaker 3>scientology and the master is loosely </v>

2099
01:38:24.781 --> 01:38:26.030
<v Speaker 3>based on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say,</v>

2100
01:38:26.050 --> 01:38:28.920
<v Speaker 3>fairly closely based on aspects of l ron</v>
<v Speaker 3>hubbard.</v>

2101
01:38:29.130 --> 01:38:30.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2102
01:38:30.510 --> 01:38:31.890
<v Speaker 3>was that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that public?</v>

2103
01:38:31.891 --> 01:38:33.810
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they had not acknowledged that,</v>

2104
01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:34.913
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he had a screening for tom </v>

2105
01:38:37.051 --> 01:38:42.051
<v Speaker 3>cruise and I think he publicly said it </v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't based on our ron hubbard and what</v>

2106
01:38:42.481 --> 01:38:44.460
<v Speaker 3>it does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think tom said.</v>

2107
01:38:45.340 --> 01:38:48.480
<v Speaker 3>What do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you hear about tom?</v>

2108
01:38:48.550 --> 01:38:50.250
<v Speaker 3>Like everyone seems to say he's a good </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>

2109
01:38:50.251 --> 01:38:51.930
<v Speaker 3>Like you meet him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

2110
01:38:51.931 --> 01:38:53.310
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2111
01:38:53.340 --> 01:38:54.630
<v Speaker 3>as you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very focused,</v>

2112
01:38:54.631 --> 01:38:56.790
<v Speaker 3>very attentive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2113
01:38:57.320 --> 01:38:58.153
<v Speaker 3>I've heard several things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One that is not as short as everybody </v>

2114
01:38:59.731 --> 01:39:02.940
<v Speaker 3>says [inaudible] lot of people at once.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's like five foot two,</v>

2115
01:39:03.240 --> 01:39:05.550
<v Speaker 3>apparently five foot nine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I've heard.</v>

2116
01:39:06.060 --> 01:39:08.340
<v Speaker 3>But who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He could be wearing some funky stuff.</v>

2117
01:39:08.350 --> 01:39:09.520
<v Speaker 3>And issues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2118
01:39:09.810 --> 01:39:12.480
<v Speaker 3>that he's very friendly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's a very,</v>

2119
01:39:12.930 --> 01:39:14.670
<v Speaker 3>very focused,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very intense,</v>

2120
01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:16.170
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very charming,</v>

2121
01:39:16.171 --> 01:39:17.580
<v Speaker 3>very charismatic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very smart,</v>

2122
01:39:18.030 --> 01:39:20.970
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seems to be genuinely interested in what</v>

2123
01:39:20.971 --> 01:39:22.410
<v Speaker 3>you have to say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2124
01:39:23.610 --> 01:39:25.280
<v Speaker 3>I mean I've heard the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you.</v>

2125
01:39:25.300 --> 01:39:28.080
<v Speaker 3>And what was your line on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would you,</v>

2126
01:39:28.081 --> 01:39:31.230
<v Speaker 3>if tom cruise is interviewed on a chat </v>
<v Speaker 3>show,</v>

2127
01:39:31.231 --> 01:39:33.780
<v Speaker 3>you feel he should be asked about </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientology?</v>

2128
01:39:33.940 --> 01:39:34.750
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd be good.</v>

2129
01:39:34.750 --> 01:39:36.150
<v Speaker 3>I'm ask him about whatever.</v>

2130
01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:37.193
<v Speaker 3>I think chat shows as you put them or </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're pretty much bullshit anyway </v>

2131
01:39:40.440 --> 01:39:41.273
<v Speaker 3>because what they really are as you have</v>
<v Speaker 3>the seven minute chunk where you </v>

2132
01:39:42.881 --> 01:39:43.714
<v Speaker 3>supposed to be promoting some movie </v>
<v Speaker 3>about a super spy that fucking repels </v>

2133
01:39:47.431 --> 01:39:49.930
<v Speaker 3>down from the ceiling and gets passed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lasers and.</v>

2134
01:39:49.931 --> 01:39:51.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>

2135
01:39:51.540 --> 01:39:52.920
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or the other.</v>

2136
01:39:53.100 --> 01:39:55.560
<v Speaker 3>I think he's a great actor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I loved that movie.</v>

2137
01:39:55.860 --> 01:39:57.070
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The edge of tomorrow?</v>

2138
01:39:57.090 --> 01:39:58.240
<v Speaker 3>It was called.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love them.</v>

2139
01:39:58.250 --> 01:40:00.210
<v Speaker 3>and that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was the time travel one.</v>

2140
01:40:00.220 --> 01:40:03.600
<v Speaker 3>My love time travel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like groundhog day meets mission</v>

2141
01:40:03.601 --> 01:40:04.420
<v Speaker 3>impulsive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2142
01:40:04.420 --> 01:40:06.480
<v Speaker 3>Meets alien.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a great movie.</v>

2143
01:40:06.481 --> 01:40:08.700
<v Speaker 3>I really enjoyed it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's a great actor.</v>

2144
01:40:08.701 --> 01:40:11.340
<v Speaker 3>And I think you have to be fucking crazy</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be a great actor.</v>

2145
01:40:11.420 --> 01:40:12.253
<v Speaker 3>He was good in that and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was nice and that was that he </v>

2146
01:40:13.681 --> 01:40:15.160
<v Speaker 3>started out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2147
01:40:15.890 --> 01:40:16.723
<v Speaker 3>in that movie as a kind of non tom </v>
<v Speaker 3>cruise character to remember he's kind </v>

2148
01:40:20.481 --> 01:40:21.314
<v Speaker 3>of cowardly and slightly weak and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>learns in the course of the movie to </v>

2149
01:40:25.261 --> 01:40:26.550
<v Speaker 3>become tom cruise.</v>

2150
01:40:26.720 --> 01:40:27.553
<v Speaker 3>Whereas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it felt refreshing after seeing so </v>

2151
01:40:28.741 --> 01:40:33.741
<v Speaker 3>many kind of cruise as uber manch films,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which by the way,</v>

2152
01:40:33.841 --> 01:40:36.900
<v Speaker 3>I think it's part of a scientology as </v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2153
01:40:36.901 --> 01:40:39.060
<v Speaker 3>is that he doesn't want to take on roles</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are.</v>

2154
01:40:39.110 --> 01:40:40.370
<v Speaker 3>And theta.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2155
01:40:40.410 --> 01:40:41.920
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see,</v>

2156
01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:42.833
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things I learned was members </v>

2157
01:40:43.531 --> 01:40:44.364
<v Speaker 3>of the ceo who had taken this vow of </v>
<v Speaker 3>poverty living extremely abstemious </v>

2158
01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:52.350
<v Speaker 3>cloistered lives and they're not allowed</v>
<v Speaker 3>to go to the movies for the most part,</v>

2159
01:40:52.380 --> 01:40:54.580
<v Speaker 3>except when a tom cruise movie comes </v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

2160
01:40:54.700 --> 01:40:56.410
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it better have a positive,</v>

2161
01:40:56.411 --> 01:40:58.480
<v Speaker 3>uplifting message.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2162
01:40:58.481 --> 01:40:59.650
<v Speaker 3>that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2163
01:40:59.651 --> 01:41:00.484
<v Speaker 3>So they would literally be bust.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was told to the cinemas to watch the </v>

2164
01:41:03.881 --> 01:41:08.500
<v Speaker 3>matinee performances of the early held </v>
<v Speaker 3>back while the previews are playing.</v>

2165
01:41:08.960 --> 01:41:11.500
<v Speaker 3>It's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine they would have to be,</v>

2166
01:41:11.501 --> 01:41:12.334
<v Speaker 3>or they what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What'd you think would be the worst </v>

2167
01:41:13.601 --> 01:41:16.870
<v Speaker 3>thing they could see in probably a </v>
<v Speaker 3>preview for my film?</v>

2168
01:41:17.170 --> 01:41:18.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that wouldn't be good.</v>

2169
01:41:18.630 --> 01:41:21.760
<v Speaker 3>They worked out how ironic their eyes </v>
<v Speaker 3>would drop out of their heads.</v>

2170
01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:22.833
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think that's one of the perhaps </v>

2171
01:41:24.701 --> 01:41:25.534
<v Speaker 3>issues they have with john travolta as </v>
<v Speaker 3>well as that he's playing a heroin </v>

2172
01:41:28.630 --> 01:41:31.420
<v Speaker 3>addict pulp fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That makes sense.</v>

2173
01:41:31.421 --> 01:41:32.254
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he really embraces some very bizarre </v>

2174
01:41:34.301 --> 01:41:35.140
<v Speaker 3>roles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2175
01:41:35.141 --> 01:41:38.920
<v Speaker 3>He was in drag in hairspray.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They probably didn't love that.</v>

2176
01:41:39.840 --> 01:41:41.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's very good.</v>

2177
01:41:41.890 --> 01:41:42.723
<v Speaker 3>He's very good at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't you love john travolta the right </v>

2178
01:41:44.321 --> 01:41:45.154
<v Speaker 3>time?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2179
01:41:45.160 --> 01:41:46.030
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love him.</v>

2180
01:41:46.031 --> 01:41:46.864
<v Speaker 3>I think he's a great actor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you feel like we've been on such a </v>

2181
01:41:49.151 --> 01:41:53.470
<v Speaker 3>journey with him from vinnie barbarino?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

2182
01:41:53.471 --> 01:41:54.620
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

2183
01:41:54.650 --> 01:41:55.780
<v Speaker 3>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a legend.</v>

2184
01:41:55.990 --> 01:41:57.900
<v Speaker 3>He's a fascinating character.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2185
01:41:57.910 --> 01:42:00.520
<v Speaker 3>I met him as well when his wife was on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the show and he was very nice,</v>

2186
01:42:00.521 --> 01:42:01.890
<v Speaker 3>but it was that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2187
01:42:01.960 --> 01:42:04.450
<v Speaker 3>where he's like really engaging,</v>
<v Speaker 3>looks you in the eyes,</v>

2188
01:42:04.480 --> 01:42:06.250
<v Speaker 3>very present,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2189
01:42:06.310 --> 01:42:07.360
<v Speaker 3>you think he's gay.</v>

2190
01:42:07.450 --> 01:42:08.850
<v Speaker 3>is that where we can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2191
01:42:08.950 --> 01:42:11.440
<v Speaker 3>people say that he's gay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2192
01:42:11.500 --> 01:42:12.333
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hAve zero problem with people being </v>

2193
01:42:15.011 --> 01:42:15.844
<v Speaker 3>gay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I do have a liTtle bit of a problem </v>

2194
01:42:17.531 --> 01:42:18.364
<v Speaker 3>with someone who's not gay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pretends that they're in or someone who </v>

2195
01:42:20.491 --> 01:42:22.420
<v Speaker 3>is gay rather.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that would be real problem.</v>

2196
01:42:22.580 --> 01:42:25.330
<v Speaker 3>Someone who's not gay and pretend gay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's hard.</v>

2197
01:42:25.620 --> 01:42:28.030
<v Speaker 3>But that's something like if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you do gay stuff,</v>

2198
01:42:28.031 --> 01:42:28.864
<v Speaker 3>you're just gay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like even if you're not gay and you </v>

2199
01:42:30.161 --> 01:42:30.994
<v Speaker 3>pretend and you like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you start dating guys like I'm not even </v>

2200
01:42:32.591 --> 01:42:34.000
<v Speaker 3>gay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm going to triCk these dudes.</v>

2201
01:42:35.800 --> 01:42:38.250
<v Speaker 3>I got news for your pal.</v>

2202
01:42:40.970 --> 01:42:42.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it could happen.</v>

2203
01:42:42.250 --> 01:42:43.480
<v Speaker 3>It's um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2204
01:42:43.481 --> 01:42:45.550
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an unfortunate as tending.</v>

2205
01:42:45.690 --> 01:42:48.490
<v Speaker 3>Is he pretending not to be gay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Allegedly,</v>

2206
01:42:48.520 --> 01:42:50.840
<v Speaker 3>that's the word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The word is allegedly is that he's,</v>

2207
01:42:50.900 --> 01:42:53.650
<v Speaker 3>he's definitely not out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if he is gay,</v>

2208
01:42:53.680 --> 01:42:54.513
<v Speaker 3>he's pretending to be straight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's photos of him kissing men </v>

2209
01:42:57.101 --> 01:42:57.934
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's allegedly these massage </v>

2210
01:42:59.501 --> 01:43:01.660
<v Speaker 3>therapists that have claimed that he </v>
<v Speaker 3>tried to have sex with them.</v>

2211
01:43:01.870 --> 01:43:02.703
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if they're telling the </v>
<v Speaker 3>truth or if they're just exploiting a </v>

2212
01:43:04.511 --> 01:43:05.344
<v Speaker 3>possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does it make you gay if you have sex </v>

2213
01:43:07.151 --> 01:43:09.520
<v Speaker 3>with a man?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It.</v>

2214
01:43:10.280 --> 01:43:14.140
<v Speaker 3>It definitely helps unless you're in </v>
<v Speaker 3>prison.</v>

2215
01:43:14.610 --> 01:43:15.443
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And even then you're just gay for the </v>

2216
01:43:16.181 --> 01:43:17.014
<v Speaker 3>stay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2217
01:43:17.140 --> 01:43:18.670
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2218
01:43:18.730 --> 01:43:19.563
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2219
01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:24.730
<v Speaker 3>I just think it's an unfortunate aspect </v>
<v Speaker 3>of our society that we're in.</v>

2220
01:43:24.780 --> 01:43:27.340
<v Speaker 3>And this is a reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If tom cruise's gay,</v>

2221
01:43:27.580 --> 01:43:32.580
<v Speaker 3>it would be a very smart business move </v>
<v Speaker 3>for him with his business to stay in the</v>

2222
01:43:32.681 --> 01:43:37.600
<v Speaker 3>closet because he's a leading man and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a leading man that has love affairs</v>

2223
01:43:37.660 --> 01:43:41.020
<v Speaker 3>in these movies with women and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>cannot do that if you're gay.</v>

2224
01:43:41.020 --> 01:43:44.170
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the weird things about being</v>
<v Speaker 3>a gay person,</v>

2225
01:43:44.171 --> 01:43:45.004
<v Speaker 3>even in today's liberated and very </v>
<v Speaker 3>progressive society that a woman can be </v>

2226
01:43:49.271 --> 01:43:53.720
<v Speaker 3>gay and she can play a straight woman in</v>
<v Speaker 3>a movie because no one cares.</v>

2227
01:43:53.990 --> 01:43:56.690
<v Speaker 3>Like if a guy meets a girl and she's </v>
<v Speaker 3>beautiful,</v>

2228
01:43:56.691 --> 01:43:57.524
<v Speaker 3>but she's been gay or whole life and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>turns around and all of a sudden she's </v>

2229
01:43:59.751 --> 01:44:00.584
<v Speaker 3>heterosexual and then he winds up </v>
<v Speaker 3>marrying her and having children with </v>

2230
01:44:02.241 --> 01:44:03.350
<v Speaker 3>her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's like,</v>

2231
01:44:03.351 --> 01:44:05.570
<v Speaker 3>we got our year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like men get excited,</v>

2232
01:44:05.750 --> 01:44:06.583
<v Speaker 3>but if a woman meets a guy who's been </v>
<v Speaker 3>just blowing dudes for the past 20 </v>

2233
01:44:10.161 --> 01:44:10.994
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then all sudden he decides he's not gay </v>

2234
01:44:12.711 --> 01:44:15.210
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not excited about that.</v>

2235
01:44:15.211 --> 01:44:16.610
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you sure you're not gay?</v>

2236
01:44:16.611 --> 01:44:18.560
<v Speaker 3>Like I don'T mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know how I feel about this.</v>

2237
01:44:18.830 --> 01:44:23.000
<v Speaker 3>It's we don't accept a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a gay person yet.</v>

2238
01:44:23.030 --> 01:44:26.990
<v Speaker 3>At least playing a straight man who is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>leading man in a movie.</v>

2239
01:44:26.991 --> 01:44:29.240
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's anyone has been </v>
<v Speaker 3>able to pull that off.</v>

2240
01:44:30.400 --> 01:44:34.070
<v Speaker 3>There's not want to Do doogie howser,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the doogie howser dude.</v>

2241
01:44:34.100 --> 01:44:34.730
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

2242
01:44:34.730 --> 01:44:36.890
<v Speaker 3>he played like a womanizer and some </v>
<v Speaker 3>sitcom,</v>

2243
01:44:36.891 --> 01:44:39.230
<v Speaker 3>but nobody's buying that bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shawn.</v>

2244
01:44:39.231 --> 01:44:42.520
<v Speaker 3>Michael,</v>
<v Speaker 3>patrick or neil Patrick Harris petrie.</v>

2245
01:44:43.130 --> 01:44:44.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2246
01:44:44.310 --> 01:44:45.380
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an interesting.</v>

2247
01:44:45.800 --> 01:44:49.790
<v Speaker 3>One of the allegations about scientology</v>
<v Speaker 3>always used to be that,</v>

2248
01:44:49.870 --> 01:44:52.850
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you spill your secrets in order to.</v>

2249
01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:57.440
<v Speaker 3>Which is like confession and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>suddenly that kept in a locked vault and</v>

2250
01:44:57.441 --> 01:45:01.360
<v Speaker 3>if you leave they become public and sort</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a test set,</v>

2251
01:45:01.900 --> 01:45:06.650
<v Speaker 3>black Male going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>so whether that's really happening,</v>

2252
01:45:07.140 --> 01:45:07.973
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now I Don't know that that may have </v>

2253
01:45:09.621 --> 01:45:11.280
<v Speaker 3>happened in the past diligence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2254
01:45:11.290 --> 01:45:15.200
<v Speaker 3>there is an issue with them going after </v>
<v Speaker 3>detractors and people that leave because</v>

2255
01:45:15.201 --> 01:45:17.470
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't really exist in other </v>
<v Speaker 3>organizations or,</v>

2256
01:45:17.471 --> 01:45:18.740
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or other religions.</v>

2257
01:45:18.740 --> 01:45:20.960
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>perfect example of another religion that</v>

2258
01:45:20.961 --> 01:45:24.860
<v Speaker 3>was most obviously created by a con man </v>
<v Speaker 3>is mormonism.</v>

2259
01:45:25.160 --> 01:45:29.090
<v Speaker 3>Joseph smith was 14 years old when he </v>
<v Speaker 3>claimed to find golden tablets that were</v>

2260
01:45:29.091 --> 01:45:31.700
<v Speaker 3>the last work of jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then only he could read them because</v>

2261
01:45:31.701 --> 01:45:34.820
<v Speaker 3>he had a magic seer stone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a ludicrous story.</v>

2262
01:45:34.821 --> 01:45:36.650
<v Speaker 3>It was a story that was created in 18,</v>
<v Speaker 3>20.</v>

2263
01:45:37.040 --> 01:45:39.890
<v Speaker 3>It's such a ludicrous story that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2264
01:45:39.891 --> 01:45:41.720
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people when they find out about</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2265
01:45:41.810 --> 01:45:42.571
<v Speaker 3>they go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well wait,</v>

2266
01:45:42.571 --> 01:45:42.910
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>

2267
01:45:42.910 --> 01:45:43.820
<v Speaker 3>hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like people,</v>

2268
01:45:43.870 --> 01:45:48.140
<v Speaker 3>people like they become mormon and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>they get deep into it and then they find</v>

2269
01:45:48.141 --> 01:45:49.580
<v Speaker 3>out the roots of this and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute,</v>

2270
01:45:49.581 --> 01:45:51.320
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>

2271
01:45:51.330 --> 01:45:56.330
<v Speaker 3>it's not scientology that mormonism is </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fastest growing religion in America.</v>

2272
01:45:57.470 --> 01:46:01.230
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if they're nice people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They seem very nice.</v>

2273
01:46:01.270 --> 01:46:02.290
<v Speaker 3>They're very nice.</v>

2274
01:46:02.380 --> 01:46:04.670
<v Speaker 3>Would it be you sit against mitt romney?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am,</v>

2275
01:46:04.671 --> 01:46:05.504
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad he's not the president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But whenever I would see him with his </v>

2276
01:46:07.251 --> 01:46:07.911
<v Speaker 3>fAmily,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>

2277
01:46:07.911 --> 01:46:09.290
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2278
01:46:09.380 --> 01:46:11.990
<v Speaker 3>why can't all family be a bit more like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that family.</v>

2279
01:46:12.050 --> 01:46:15.470
<v Speaker 3>I am not glad he's not running for </v>
<v Speaker 3>president right now.</v>

2280
01:46:15.750 --> 01:46:17.780
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's a better choice.</v>

2281
01:46:17.781 --> 01:46:18.614
<v Speaker 3>And I was shocked that he wasn't willing</v>
<v Speaker 3>to oppose Donald Trump because I think </v>

2282
01:46:22.521 --> 01:46:26.030
<v Speaker 3>that that would be a fucking easy run </v>
<v Speaker 3>for people that were conservative,</v>

2283
01:46:26.031 --> 01:46:26.864
<v Speaker 3>that we're uncomfortable with this trump</v>
<v Speaker 3>character and all his fucking loose </v>

2284
01:46:30.411 --> 01:46:32.780
<v Speaker 3>dialogue and all the crazy shit that he </v>
<v Speaker 3>says.</v>

2285
01:46:32.850 --> 01:46:33.683
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what I think what trump has his </v>

2286
01:46:37.150 --> 01:46:39.230
<v Speaker 3>way he's proved so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2287
01:46:39.880 --> 01:46:43.970
<v Speaker 3>so durable and popular is just this </v>
<v Speaker 3>absolute.</v>

2288
01:46:44.090 --> 01:46:45.710
<v Speaker 3>I'm different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

2289
01:46:46.460 --> 01:46:49.370
<v Speaker 3>Fuck everything into establishment at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>

2290
01:46:49.710 --> 01:46:52.280
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly what romney doesn't have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ron miller side,</v>

2291
01:46:52.281 --> 01:46:53.700
<v Speaker 3>the consummate insider.</v>

2292
01:46:54.090 --> 01:46:55.790
<v Speaker 3>He's um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

2293
01:46:56.010 --> 01:46:59.910
<v Speaker 3>he's establishment Washington.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the rest of it and trump seemed is a</v>

2294
01:46:59.911 --> 01:47:01.520
<v Speaker 3>kind of caveman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2295
01:47:01.530 --> 01:47:03.180
<v Speaker 3>he's a weird guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there was,</v>

2296
01:47:03.200 --> 01:47:04.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people out there,</v>

2297
01:47:04.350 --> 01:47:06.120
<v Speaker 3>I think white collar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blue collar,</v>

2298
01:47:06.150 --> 01:47:09.480
<v Speaker 3>kind of white americans on the front </v>
<v Speaker 3>porch see trump and they think,</v>

2299
01:47:09.481 --> 01:47:10.890
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy is my guy.</v>

2300
01:47:11.310 --> 01:47:12.143
<v Speaker 3>While they embrace the strong man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a strong man who doesn't give a </v>

2301
01:47:14.881 --> 01:47:16.230
<v Speaker 3>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says crazy things.</v>

2302
01:47:16.231 --> 01:47:20.610
<v Speaker 3>He talks about our biggest penises.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he does that mean that the run up</v>

2303
01:47:20.611 --> 01:47:21.444
<v Speaker 3>to becoming the republican nominee was </v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the most embarrassing times ever </v>

2304
01:47:24.541 --> 01:47:25.374
<v Speaker 3>for the republican party because you had</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these fools dancing around this </v>

2305
01:47:29.790 --> 01:47:33.090
<v Speaker 3>strong man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really good robo candidates.</v>

2306
01:47:33.091 --> 01:47:37.380
<v Speaker 3>Almost literally in the case of rubio </v>
<v Speaker 3>was malfunctioning with his,</v>

2307
01:47:37.680 --> 01:47:40.200
<v Speaker 3>his kind of soundbite algorithm was </v>
<v Speaker 3>glitching.</v>

2308
01:47:40.201 --> 01:47:43.230
<v Speaker 3>So was coming out with the same sound </v>
<v Speaker 3>bite within 10 seconds,</v>

2309
01:47:43.620 --> 01:47:44.453
<v Speaker 3>but all these robo candidates and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone who seemed like a kind of </v>

2310
01:47:47.010 --> 01:47:50.190
<v Speaker 3>visceral flesh and blood human on stage </v>
<v Speaker 3>and who.</v>

2311
01:47:50.190 --> 01:47:51.023
<v Speaker 3>Moreover,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he said stupid crazy stuff did not </v>

2312
01:47:53.611 --> 01:47:55.920
<v Speaker 3>then hit the trail to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to apologize,</v>

2313
01:47:56.220 --> 01:47:59.310
<v Speaker 3>he would just keep saying weird things </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think felt like,</v>

2314
01:47:59.311 --> 01:48:03.270
<v Speaker 3>you know what he's showing the media for</v>
<v Speaker 3>the shell game that it is.</v>

2315
01:48:03.271 --> 01:48:05.180
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because he's saying,</v>

2316
01:48:05.181 --> 01:48:06.930
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to do that thing if like,</v>

2317
01:48:07.130 --> 01:48:09.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm so sorry I said that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where It's like,</v>

2318
01:48:09.540 --> 01:48:10.373
<v Speaker 3>and also they all cliche,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but who would you want to have a beer </v>

2319
01:48:11.671 --> 01:48:12.504
<v Speaker 3>with?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would you want to have a beer with </v>

2320
01:48:13.081 --> 01:48:13.914
<v Speaker 3>romney?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Romney probably doesn't drink beers and </v>

2321
01:48:15.670 --> 01:48:16.980
<v Speaker 3>drink and then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2322
01:48:16.981 --> 01:48:18.840
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and trump actually,</v>

2323
01:48:18.841 --> 01:48:21.750
<v Speaker 3>you would probably enjoy the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>weird,</v>

2324
01:48:21.751 --> 01:48:22.584
<v Speaker 3>ludicrous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just peering at him would be </v>

2325
01:48:23.971 --> 01:48:27.060
<v Speaker 3>entertaining in itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you ever see the picture that he put</v>

2326
01:48:27.061 --> 01:48:31.140
<v Speaker 3>up on instagram with him in trump tower </v>
<v Speaker 3>eating a taco bowl?</v>

2327
01:48:31.440 --> 01:48:36.000
<v Speaker 3>And this was after all the crazy remarks</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he'd said about Mexico and mexicans</v>

2328
01:48:36.001 --> 01:48:39.450
<v Speaker 3>coming over here and raping,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I talked to the president of Mexico,</v>

2329
01:48:39.451 --> 01:48:40.830
<v Speaker 3>who's going to pay for that wall?</v>

2330
01:48:41.020 --> 01:48:42.330
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not going to pay for that wall.</v>

2331
01:48:42.331 --> 01:48:42.781
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2332
01:48:42.781 --> 01:48:43.614
<v Speaker 3>the wall just got 10 foot higher and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody starts cheering and then he </v>

2333
01:48:46.501 --> 01:48:49.950
<v Speaker 3>takes a photo on instagram of him </v>
<v Speaker 3>smiling,</v>

2334
01:48:50.130 --> 01:48:50.963
<v Speaker 3>eating a taco bowl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at this at trump tower and it says </v>

2335
01:48:55.351 --> 01:48:57.030
<v Speaker 3>he's got the thumbs up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's eating this,</v>

2336
01:48:57.200 --> 01:48:59.490
<v Speaker 3>this taco bone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It said something about like,</v>

2337
01:48:59.550 --> 01:49:03.870
<v Speaker 3>I love hispanics.</v>

<v Speaker 3>in trump tower grille.</v>

2340
01:49:08.730 --> 01:49:10.920
<v Speaker 3>And then he also said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love hispanics.</v>

2341
01:49:11.040 --> 01:49:14.030
<v Speaker 3>Like see if you can find the actual </v>
<v Speaker 3>instagram post.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Because it isn't.</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's his genius is that he could speak</v>

2348
01:49:32.971 --> 01:49:33.451
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'll,</v>

2349
01:49:33.451 --> 01:49:38.451
<v Speaker 3>he'll say something crazy and then 10 </v>
<v Speaker 3>minutes later he'll say,</v>

2350
01:49:39.151 --> 01:49:40.830
<v Speaker 3>he'll say something contradictory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2351

<v Speaker 3>it's fun for us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fun for us.</v>

2352
01:49:42.690 --> 01:49:43.523
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fun for us and also he doesn't </v>

2353
01:49:45.631 --> 01:49:48.070
<v Speaker 3>necessarily represent for</v>

2354
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:49.330
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't like.</v>

2355
01:49:49.331 --> 01:49:51.400
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that romneY </v>
<v Speaker 1>represents,</v>

2356
01:49:51.401 --> 01:49:55.750
<v Speaker 1>it's problematic for people is that not </v>
<v Speaker 1>only is his father a mormon,</v>

2357
01:49:55.800 --> 01:49:56.633
<v Speaker 1>not only is it from the but he's from </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the most bizarre sex of mormons </v>

2358
01:49:59.770 --> 01:50:04.390
<v Speaker 1>were they left the United States so that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can have multiple wives who?</v>

2359
01:50:04.391 --> 01:50:05.410
<v Speaker 1>Romney's family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2360
01:50:05.411 --> 01:50:09.260
<v Speaker 1>You don't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me hook you up.</v>

2361
01:50:10.450 --> 01:50:13.500
<v Speaker 1>Romney's family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2362
01:50:13.660 --> 01:50:16.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the fuck it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was a vice piece on.</v>

2363
01:50:16.661 --> 01:50:18.310
<v Speaker 1>It's a fascinating piece there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There.</v>

2364
01:50:18.311 --> 01:50:22.120
<v Speaker 1>They all live in Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The romney's family.</v>

2365
01:50:22.240 --> 01:50:25.690
<v Speaker 1>I know who you mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They moved to Mexico before romney's dad</v>

2366
01:50:25.691 --> 01:50:26.524
<v Speaker 1>was born.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Romney's dad was not born in the United </v>

2367
01:50:28.120 --> 01:50:28.953
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was born in Mexico and when the </v>

2368
01:50:30.641 --> 01:50:31.474
<v Speaker 1>United States made polygamy illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just said this was in the 18 </v>

2369
01:50:35.111 --> 01:50:36.400
<v Speaker 1>hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't have cars,</v>

2370
01:50:36.580 --> 01:50:37.391
<v Speaker 1>so people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2371
01:50:37.391 --> 01:50:37.990
<v Speaker 1>who gives a shit?</v>

2372
01:50:37.990 --> 01:50:38.823
<v Speaker 1>If we're in the United States or Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're still riding horses and banging </v>

2373
01:50:42.671 --> 01:50:44.350
<v Speaker 1>our nine slash wives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's just go over there.</v>

2374
01:50:44.470 --> 01:50:47.500
<v Speaker 1>So they didn't want to give up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>polygamy aspect of the religion.</v>

2375
01:50:47.501 --> 01:50:48.334
<v Speaker 1>So they just went south to Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was not that Much different than </v>

2376
01:50:51.581 --> 01:50:52.414
<v Speaker 1>the United States back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then when cars were invented in the </v>

2377
01:50:56.051 --> 01:50:56.884
<v Speaker 1>United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really exploded and became much more </v>

2378
01:50:59.141 --> 01:50:59.974
<v Speaker 1>prosperous than Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then ultimately it got even crazier who </v>

2379
01:51:02.971 --> 01:51:06.390
<v Speaker 1>they get involved in the drug war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the drug war where there were,</v>

2380
01:51:06.400 --> 01:51:07.233
<v Speaker 1>there was a drug cartel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were kidnapping people in the </v>

2381
01:51:09.731 --> 01:51:13.000
<v Speaker 1>romney family and other mormons that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>living down there.</v>

2382
01:51:13.090 --> 01:51:13.923
<v Speaker 1>So they started being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had armed gUards on century 24 </v>

2383
01:51:17.351 --> 01:51:17.670
<v Speaker 1>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2384
01:51:17.670 --> 01:51:18.503
<v Speaker 1>it's like a scene from the walking dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all standing there with high </v>

2385
01:51:20.921 --> 01:51:23.390
<v Speaker 1>powered rifle when we're talking with </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

2386
01:51:23.710 --> 01:51:27.010
<v Speaker 1>So family is still down this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2387
01:51:27.160 --> 01:51:27.941
<v Speaker 1>Oh my goodness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2388
01:51:27.941 --> 01:51:31.330
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing right now what ronnie was </v>
<v Speaker 1>born in the United States.</v>

2389
01:51:31.630 --> 01:51:32.463
<v Speaker 1>It's the mexican mormon war and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>vice series and it is wonderful because </v>

2390
01:51:37.241 --> 01:51:38.074
<v Speaker 1>this is something that for whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason was not really discussed during </v>

2391
01:51:41.021 --> 01:51:41.854
<v Speaker 1>the campaign trail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they tried to keep this because </v>

2392
01:51:45.041 --> 01:51:45.874
<v Speaker 1>I think they thought it would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly damaging to the republican </v>

2393
01:51:47.681 --> 01:51:50.830
<v Speaker 1>party because this guy is the front </v>
<v Speaker 1>runner for the republicans.</v>

2394
01:51:50.831 --> 01:51:55.030
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know who the fuck on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>democratic side agreed to not really get</v>

2395
01:51:55.031 --> 01:51:55.864
<v Speaker 1>into this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that means they're not just a part </v>

2396
01:51:57.491 --> 01:51:58.324
<v Speaker 1>of a cult or a part of a gun toting </v>
<v Speaker 1>polygamous cult that has an armed </v>

2397
01:52:02.261 --> 01:52:05.950
<v Speaker 1>compound in Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do I not know this?</v>

2398
01:52:06.010 --> 01:52:06.843
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why romney's dad wanted to be </v>

2399
01:52:09.221 --> 01:52:10.054
<v Speaker 1>president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but could not run for president because </v>

2400
01:52:11.321 --> 01:52:12.154
<v Speaker 1>he was born in Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He came out of his mother's body in the </v>

2401
01:52:15.731 --> 01:52:19.240
<v Speaker 1>wrong patch of dirt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we did not allow him to run our great</v>

2402
01:52:19.241 --> 01:52:21.720
<v Speaker 1>nation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2403
01:52:21.740 --> 01:52:23.620
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did he become a senator?</v>

2404
01:52:23.920 --> 01:52:25.750
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do not remember.</v>

2405
01:52:25.780 --> 01:52:30.400
<v Speaker 1>It was involved in politics in some way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ted cruz was born in Canada though,</v>

2406
01:52:30.401 --> 01:52:32.680
<v Speaker 1>running.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So did they change the rules?</v>

2407
01:52:32.681 --> 01:52:35.580
<v Speaker 1>Dirty canadian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not one of us to love canadians.</v>

2408
01:52:35.581 --> 01:52:37.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did they change the rules?</v>

2409
01:52:37.540 --> 01:52:38.680
<v Speaker 1>A?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2410
01:52:38.740 --> 01:52:43.740
<v Speaker 1>because he has dual citizenship because </v>
<v Speaker 1>his mother was a can be born.</v>

2411
01:52:44.410 --> 01:52:46.070
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like my friend</v>

2412
01:52:46.070 --> 01:52:48.800
<v Speaker 3>brian was born in the Philippines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's american because he was born.</v>

2413
01:52:49.610 --> 01:52:50.750
<v Speaker 3>He was going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2414
01:52:50.960 --> 01:52:51.793
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can't be president and not born </v>

2415
01:52:53.241 --> 01:52:55.340
<v Speaker 3>in the us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In my book,</v>

2416
01:52:55.341 --> 01:52:57.830
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>

2417
01:52:57.831 --> 01:52:58.664
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was not given the god given right to </v>

2418
01:53:00.951 --> 01:53:04.070
<v Speaker 3>be born the right patch dirt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So fuck him.</v>

2419
01:53:04.730 --> 01:53:07.190
<v Speaker 3>That's in my book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but constitution.</v>

2420
01:53:07.210 --> 01:53:08.660
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was something that Donald Trump was</v>

2421
01:53:08.690 --> 01:53:09.321
<v Speaker 3>bringing up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2422
01:53:09.321 --> 01:53:11.990
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people do forget conveniently,</v>

2423
01:53:11.991 --> 01:53:14.510
<v Speaker 3>the Donald Trump was one of the primary </v>
<v Speaker 3>birthers.</v>

2424
01:53:14.900 --> 01:53:15.733
<v Speaker 3>He was one of the biggest proponents of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea that obama was not born in </v>

2425
01:53:19.821 --> 01:53:21.830
<v Speaker 3>America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he was born in Kenya.</v>

2426
01:53:22.100 --> 01:53:23.540
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was a bIg issue.</v>

2427
01:53:23.870 --> 01:53:24.860
<v Speaker 3>Big time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huge.</v>

2428
01:53:24.861 --> 01:53:25.880
<v Speaker 3>He was a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He still.</v>

2429
01:53:25.940 --> 01:53:28.760
<v Speaker 3>It's a propounding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

2430
01:53:28.761 --> 01:53:31.720
<v Speaker 3>Fringe conspiracy nut beliefs about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2431
01:53:31.730 --> 01:53:36.140
<v Speaker 3>he said that obama founded isis right at</v>
<v Speaker 3>a rally in Florida.</v>

2432
01:53:37.100 --> 01:53:39.920
<v Speaker 3>Did he find Iceland?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did he,</v>

2433
01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.180
<v Speaker 3>the atom bomb?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had started ice,</v>

2434
01:53:42.250 --> 01:53:43.083
<v Speaker 3>but did he decide to say this at a rally</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Florida or did obama found isis in a </v>

2435
01:53:49.201 --> 01:53:52.370
<v Speaker 3>rally in Florida?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he said it the rally.</v>

2436
01:53:52.380 --> 01:53:56.750
<v Speaker 3>I said that obama founded it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oba,</v>

2437
01:53:57.470 --> 01:53:59.210
<v Speaker 3>let me hear this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's hear this</v>

2438
01:53:59.350 --> 01:54:04.180
<v Speaker 4>all over the middle east and it was a </v>
<v Speaker 4>terrible mistake.</v>

2439
01:54:04.690 --> 01:54:09.160
<v Speaker 4>And then obama came In and normally you </v>
<v Speaker 4>want to clean up.</v>

2440
01:54:09.400 --> 01:54:10.233
<v Speaker 4>He made a bigger mess out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He made such a mess and then you had </v>

2441
01:54:13.751 --> 01:54:14.860
<v Speaker 4>hillary with Libya.</v>

2442
01:54:16.500 --> 01:54:19.450
<v Speaker 5>So sad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>

2443
01:54:20.830 --> 01:54:23.170
<v Speaker 5>in many respects,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2444
01:54:23.260 --> 01:54:28.260
<v Speaker 5>they honor president obama.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Isis is honoring president obama.</v>

2445
01:54:32.230 --> 01:54:35.950
<v Speaker 5>He is the founder of isis.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's the founder of isis.</v>

2446
01:54:37.370 --> 01:54:42.370
<v Speaker 5>The founder said it three times and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>would say the cofounder would be crooked</v>

2447
01:54:48.460 --> 01:54:51.920
<v Speaker 5>hillary clinton.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wonder</v>

2448
01:54:51.920 --> 01:54:55.310
<v Speaker 3>if he knows what the word found means.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't give a fuck.</v>

2449
01:54:55.520 --> 01:54:57.860
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a pro wrestling candidate.</v>

2450
01:54:57.920 --> 01:55:02.920
<v Speaker 3>I had a bit about this in 2005.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a bit about George Bush in that.</v>

2451
01:55:04.460 --> 01:55:05.293
<v Speaker 3>He was so dumb that I don't think that </v>
<v Speaker 3>he was really the candidate that the </v>

2452
01:55:10.191 --> 01:55:12.200
<v Speaker 3>republicans like the best candIdate that</v>
<v Speaker 3>could have.</v>

2453
01:55:12.350 --> 01:55:15.800
<v Speaker 3>I think it was a test to find out how </v>
<v Speaker 3>dumb people are because there's only one</v>

2454
01:55:15.801 --> 01:55:18.740
<v Speaker 3>way to tell if the people that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bankers and the industrialists,</v>

2455
01:55:18.741 --> 01:55:21.200
<v Speaker 3>they don't really know how dumb </v>
<v Speaker 3>americans are.</v>

2456
01:55:21.201 --> 01:55:24.650
<v Speaker 3>They know about pop culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They know what people like and that they</v>

2457
01:55:24.651 --> 01:55:26.750
<v Speaker 3>the only.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was only one way to find out.</v>

2458
01:55:26.780 --> 01:55:31.780
<v Speaker 3>You put a dumb guy in the office and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>see how people react and that at the end</v>

2459
01:55:32.330 --> 01:55:32.770
<v Speaker 3>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2460
01:55:32.770 --> 01:55:35.750
<v Speaker 3>the first year when he won again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or the first term when you want again,</v>

2461
01:55:36.490 --> 01:55:39.260
<v Speaker 3>I think there were sitting around going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we can go dumber,</v>

2462
01:55:40.980 --> 01:55:44.250
<v Speaker 3>and they just decided to get some </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking</v>

2463
01:55:44.670 --> 01:55:47.910
<v Speaker 1>pro wrestling type president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some,</v>

2464
01:55:47.940 --> 01:55:48.773
<v Speaker 1>some dude who's like a combination of </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a drill sergeant and have a pro </v>

2465
01:55:52.381 --> 01:55:54.170
<v Speaker 1>wrestler who just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2466
01:55:54.190 --> 01:55:56.680
<v Speaker 1>you just go to ted nugent concert and </v>
<v Speaker 1>scoop people up,</v>

2467
01:55:56.681 --> 01:56:00.960
<v Speaker 1>but nets and you just set them up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that this is kind of what he is.</v>

2468
01:56:01.130 --> 01:56:02.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you watched that.</v>

2469
01:56:02.341 --> 01:56:06.930
<v Speaker 1>That is like the way the audience is </v>
<v Speaker 1>yelling along and cheering.</v>

2470
01:56:07.290 --> 01:56:09.060
<v Speaker 1>It's theatrical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

2471
01:56:09.090 --> 01:56:11.830
<v Speaker 1>this is all like a parade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's theater.</v>

2472
01:56:12.210 --> 01:56:13.043
<v Speaker 1>They don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't necessarily think that obama </v>

2473
01:56:14.821 --> 01:56:19.380
<v Speaker 1>really founded isis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't care if he did or not.</v>

2474
01:56:19.680 --> 01:56:20.910
<v Speaker 1>There's no thinking there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>

2475
01:56:20.920 --> 01:56:24.480
<v Speaker 1>there's a box that they operate on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very small box.</v>

2476
01:56:24.690 --> 01:56:27.180
<v Speaker 1>They operate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All their thoughts exist inside this box</v>

2477
01:56:27.480 --> 01:56:29.430
<v Speaker 1>and they never expand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd never go there.</v>

2478
01:56:29.431 --> 01:56:30.840
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no nuance.</v>

2479
01:56:30.841 --> 01:56:32.190
<v Speaker 1>There's no subtlety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no,</v>

2480
01:56:32.191 --> 01:56:35.460
<v Speaker 1>there's no broad spectrum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no big picture.</v>

2481
01:56:35.630 --> 01:56:39.810
<v Speaker 1>There was none of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just assholes have their king.</v>

2482
01:56:40.230 --> 01:56:42.930
<v Speaker 1>We have a lot of assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really easy to survive.</v>

2483
01:56:43.080 --> 01:56:44.570
<v Speaker 1>It's real easy to have.</v>

2484
01:56:45.160 --> 01:56:47.400
<v Speaker 2>You can't have thought when this started</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2485
01:56:47.570 --> 01:56:49.940
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't have thought that this </v>
<v Speaker 2>would get this far,</v>

2486
01:56:50.380 --> 01:56:53.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seemed like a joke to begin with.</v>

2487
01:56:53.840 --> 01:56:54.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2488
01:56:54.490 --> 01:56:57.610
<v Speaker 1>I thought somewhere along the line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cooler heads will prevail,</v>

2489
01:56:59.200 --> 01:56:59.800
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2490
01:56:59.800 --> 01:57:03.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm torn because as a comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2491
01:57:03.191 --> 01:57:05.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is a fucking gold mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are,</v>

2492
01:57:05.950 --> 01:57:06.783
<v Speaker 1>they're about to open up a dam of gold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to break down the dam and </v>

2493
01:57:10.230 --> 01:57:12.910
<v Speaker 1>gold is going to flow down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be amazing.</v>

2494
01:57:12.911 --> 01:57:13.744
<v Speaker 1>But as a human being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this kid literally lead to the end of </v>

2495
01:57:17.230 --> 01:57:17.850
<v Speaker 1>civilization.</v>

2496
01:57:17.850 --> 01:57:18.560
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All.</v>

2497
01:57:18.560 --> 01:57:20.660
<v Speaker 2>So as a student,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as myself,</v>

2498
01:57:20.670 --> 01:57:21.503
<v Speaker 2>as a sort of student of kind of self </v>
<v Speaker 2>sabotage and the puzzle at [inaudible] </v>

2499
01:57:27.501 --> 01:57:29.460
<v Speaker 2>of the human condition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you know what I mean?</v>

2500
01:57:29.700 --> 01:57:31.560
<v Speaker 2>I find it fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2501
01:57:31.920 --> 01:57:34.140
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could be the end of the world,</v>

2502
01:57:34.170 --> 01:57:35.003
<v Speaker 2>but it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just see things happening that </v>

2503
01:57:37.820 --> 01:57:40.490
<v Speaker 2>absolutely are unprecedented and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's.</v>

2504
01:57:40.560 --> 01:57:44.730
<v Speaker 2>I have a kind of chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chaotic streak that enjoys.</v>

2505
01:57:44.731 --> 01:57:45.564
<v Speaker 2>It's like that feeling you get in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>playground as a kid when a fight breaks </v>

2506
01:57:48.481 --> 01:57:49.410
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight,</v>

2507
01:57:49.500 --> 01:57:50.310
<v Speaker 2>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>

2508
01:57:50.310 --> 01:57:51.450
<v Speaker 2>You just sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's.</v>

2509
01:57:51.460 --> 01:57:55.200
<v Speaker 2>It was an arsonist thrill of seeing </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization burned.</v>

2510
01:57:55.270 --> 01:57:57.150
<v Speaker 1>Something's gonna happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something's crazy.</v>

2511
01:57:57.151 --> 01:57:58.900
<v Speaker 1>It's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not business as usual.</v>

2512
01:57:58.910 --> 01:58:00.430
<v Speaker 1>Here's another thing that I like about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2513
01:58:00.490 --> 01:58:01.323
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of things that he says </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are absolutely true and here's one </v>

2514
01:58:03.881 --> 01:58:05.920
<v Speaker 1>of the things that I like about what </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump represents.</v>

2515
01:58:06.100 --> 01:58:10.720
<v Speaker 1>He is not the political establishment </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the political establishment sucks.</v>

2516
01:58:10.810 --> 01:58:13.390
<v Speaker 1>It really does suck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a corrupt,</v>

2517
01:58:13.600 --> 01:58:14.433
<v Speaker 1>completely corrupt institution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what he's saying about crooked </v>

2518
01:58:16.871 --> 01:58:18.220
<v Speaker 1>hillary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

2519
01:58:18.370 --> 01:58:19.930
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the clinton foundation,</v>

2520
01:58:19.931 --> 01:58:20.764
<v Speaker 1>you look at what they've been able to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the laws they've been able to skirt </v>

2521
01:58:23.411 --> 01:58:24.244
<v Speaker 1>and the amount of influence they're able</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have and the amount of money that </v>

2522
01:58:26.801 --> 01:58:27.634
<v Speaker 1>they're able to generate and where that </v>
<v Speaker 1>money goes and how ambiguous it is and </v>

2523
01:58:30.280 --> 01:58:32.860
<v Speaker 1>how would that hasn't been investigated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's right.</v>

2524
01:58:33.190 --> 01:58:34.023
<v Speaker 1>He's right in a lot of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I hope that a lot of what he's doiNg </v>

2525
01:58:37.001 --> 01:58:39.370
<v Speaker 1>is theatrical and if he does wind up </v>
<v Speaker 1>winning,</v>

2526
01:58:39.610 --> 01:58:40.443
<v Speaker 1>I hope that he puts around hiM some real</v>
<v Speaker 1>political advisors that understand </v>

2527
01:58:44.561 --> 01:58:46.600
<v Speaker 1>international policy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that understanding the,</v>

2528
01:58:46.630 --> 01:58:47.860
<v Speaker 1>he tones everything down.</v>

2529
01:58:48.040 --> 01:58:50.110
<v Speaker 1>And This was all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the ultimate hope,</v>

2530
01:58:50.320 --> 01:58:52.690
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't necessarily think it's true that</v>

2531
01:58:52.691 --> 01:58:55.480
<v Speaker 1>he loses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you hope that hillary wins?</v>

2532
01:58:55.830 --> 01:58:57.220
<v Speaker 1>Because I hope that she doesn't win </v>
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>

2533
01:58:57.380 --> 01:59:00.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't see what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't see jill stein winning.</v>

2534
01:59:00.101 --> 01:59:01.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think It's either.</v>

2535
01:59:01.180 --> 01:59:02.930
<v Speaker 1>What about Gary Johnson here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My.</v>

2536
01:59:02.980 --> 01:59:04.750
<v Speaker 1>Who is Gary Jones?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How dare you.</v>

2537
01:59:05.110 --> 01:59:05.950
<v Speaker 1>He's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2538
01:59:06.160 --> 01:59:08.830
<v Speaker 1>he's an independent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a Gary Johnson.</v>

2539
01:59:08.860 --> 01:59:10.900
<v Speaker 1>The libertarian candidate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very reasonable.</v>

2540
01:59:10.901 --> 01:59:13.860
<v Speaker 1>Gun weld was the libertarian candidate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2541
01:59:13.960 --> 01:59:16.090
<v Speaker 1>it was johnson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>johnson with weld as well.</v>

2542
01:59:16.091 --> 01:59:16.924
<v Speaker 1>Does well device.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to find johnson is the form </v>

2543
01:59:20.161 --> 01:59:25.161
<v Speaker 1>of government hillary and and trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would go trump.</v>

2544
01:59:26.380 --> 01:59:27.700
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2545
01:59:28.040 --> 01:59:28.541
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2546
01:59:28.541 --> 01:59:31.060
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Asteroid which opened.</v>

2547
01:59:31.061 --> 01:59:36.061
<v Speaker 1>Asteroid hits like I don't like either </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of them.</v>

2548
01:59:38.170 --> 01:59:43.030
<v Speaker 1>What you said about it took a orange </v>
<v Speaker 1>head casino magnate.</v>

2549
01:59:44.160 --> 01:59:47.950
<v Speaker 1>Pathological lying issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Point out the truth about the american,</v>

2550
01:59:47.980 --> 01:59:49.400
<v Speaker 1>the brokenness of the american.</v>

2551
01:59:49.600 --> 01:59:51.880
<v Speaker 1>Gary johnson and bill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well bill weld as his vice president.</v>

2552
01:59:51.881 --> 01:59:52.760
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2553
01:59:52.780 --> 01:59:53.613
<v Speaker 1>I think we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're in a bad place with either one of </v>

2554
01:59:56.891 --> 01:59:57.724
<v Speaker 1>them because either one of them are </v>
<v Speaker 1>exposing the ridiculous aspects of our </v>

2555
02:00:01.120 --> 02:00:04.960
<v Speaker 1>society and the ridiculous aspects of </v>
<v Speaker 1>our political establishment,</v>

2556
02:00:05.170 --> 02:00:07.420
<v Speaker 1>our political system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just not a good system.</v>

2557
02:00:07.600 --> 02:00:08.433
<v Speaker 1>Representative government doesn't make </v>
<v Speaker 1>any sense when people can represent </v>

2558
02:00:10.451 --> 02:00:11.284
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it made sense back when it was </v>

2559
02:00:13.121 --> 02:00:16.390
<v Speaker 1>impossible to get word to Washington how</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these people felt.</v>

2560
02:00:16.780 --> 02:00:18.460
<v Speaker 1>But now that people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2561
02:00:18.550 --> 02:00:19.383
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're almost saying by continuing </v>

2562
02:00:21.431 --> 02:00:24.970
<v Speaker 1>representative government in 2016,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're almost saying that,</v>

2563
02:00:24.971 --> 02:00:25.804
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't have one person one vote </v>

2564
02:00:27.940 --> 02:00:29.800
<v Speaker 1>because people are too fucking stupid </v>
<v Speaker 1>for that.</v>

2565
02:00:30.160 --> 02:00:31.550
<v Speaker 1>Mean you're almost saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2566
02:00:31.610 --> 02:00:33.700
<v Speaker 1>maybe they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but are they,</v>

2567
02:00:34.150 --> 02:00:34.983
<v Speaker 1>and if that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to fix that instead of just </v>

2568
02:00:37.061 --> 02:00:41.530
<v Speaker 1>continuing business as usual to figure </v>
<v Speaker 1>out how to expand our educational system</v>

2569
02:00:41.531 --> 02:00:42.364
<v Speaker 1>or enlightened some of these people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe drop mushrooms everywhere or </v>

2570
02:00:45.221 --> 02:00:46.054
<v Speaker 1>something when there's gotta be a better</v>
<v Speaker 1>way than just continuing business as </v>

2571
02:00:49.391 --> 02:00:49.900
<v Speaker 1>usual.</v>

2572
02:00:49.900 --> 02:00:53.380
<v Speaker 1>And that business has been shown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in hillary clinton's case,</v>

2573
02:00:53.381 --> 02:00:55.510
<v Speaker 1>to be completely corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think?</v>

2574
02:00:56.050 --> 02:00:59.680
<v Speaker 1>How would you rate obama?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked him as a human.</v>

2575
02:00:59.890 --> 02:01:02.500
<v Speaker 1>What I like about obama is he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>measured,</v>

2576
02:01:02.560 --> 02:01:05.440
<v Speaker 1>he's intelligent and I think there's one</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that has.</v>

2577
02:01:05.640 --> 02:01:08.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean as much as when you look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>politics,</v>

2578
02:01:08.381 --> 02:01:09.820
<v Speaker 1>you look at someone who's running the </v>
<v Speaker 1>president,</v>

2579
02:01:09.850 --> 02:01:11.890
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of speculation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much power does he have?</v>

2580
02:01:11.891 --> 02:01:14.770
<v Speaker 1>What does it like behind closed doors?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are those meetings like is,</v>

2581
02:01:14.960 --> 02:01:17.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like sam harris is an interesting point.</v>

2582
02:01:17.640 --> 02:01:18.473
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is obama a guy who was lying all along </v>

2583
02:01:21.760 --> 02:01:25.090
<v Speaker 1>or when he was running for president and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then gets into office and does different</v>

2584
02:01:25.091 --> 02:01:25.924
<v Speaker 1>things like keeps guantanamo bay open </v>
<v Speaker 1>and doesn't leave Iraq and all the </v>

2585
02:01:28.421 --> 02:01:30.880
<v Speaker 1>different things that he sort of reneged</v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

2586
02:01:31.240 --> 02:01:32.073
<v Speaker 1>or is it that you become president and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you are briefed and then someone </v>

2587
02:01:36.221 --> 02:01:39.980
<v Speaker 1>sits down and explains to you the </v>
<v Speaker 1>horrific nature of the outside world and</v>

2588
02:01:39.981 --> 02:01:42.560
<v Speaker 1>here are the threats to civilization </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

2589
02:01:42.800 --> 02:01:45.470
<v Speaker 1>Here are The threats in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrorism,</v>

2590
02:01:45.710 --> 02:01:46.543
<v Speaker 1>in terms of these different </v>
<v Speaker 1>dictatorships that are seeking to gain </v>

2591
02:01:50.421 --> 02:01:53.090
<v Speaker 1>nuclear arms and here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's some real problems and here's the</v>

2592
02:01:53.091 --> 02:01:53.924
<v Speaker 1>strategies and here's what we have to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>and here's why we can't do what you </v>

2593
02:01:55.491 --> 02:01:58.310
<v Speaker 1>promIse is that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what we don't know,</v>

2594
02:01:58.580 --> 02:02:00.440
<v Speaker 1>but what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what obama does represent,</v>

2595
02:02:00.441 --> 02:02:03.800
<v Speaker 1>and here's what trickles down is as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2596
02:02:04.010 --> 02:02:06.890
<v Speaker 1>he's very measured.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's very intelligent.</v>

2597
02:02:07.130 --> 02:02:09.260
<v Speaker 1>He's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's very articulate.</v>

2598
02:02:09.410 --> 02:02:14.270
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't lose his cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't respond to nonsense,</v>

2599
02:02:14.600 --> 02:02:15.433
<v Speaker 1>and the speeches that he gives are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are a great representative of </v>

2600
02:02:21.260 --> 02:02:23.750
<v Speaker 1>education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of dignity,</v>

2601
02:02:23.990 --> 02:02:28.010
<v Speaker 1>of a guy who speaks very well and a guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>who is smarter than most people that,</v>

2602
02:02:28.011 --> 02:02:30.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's something to be said for</v>

2603
02:02:30.621 --> 02:02:34.460
<v Speaker 1>that and I think that that is what </v>
<v Speaker 1>George Bush wasn't and that was what was</v>

2604
02:02:34.461 --> 02:02:37.380
<v Speaker 1>appealing to me about obama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

2605
02:02:37.460 --> 02:02:39.380
<v Speaker 1>but he bullshits too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2606
02:02:39.381 --> 02:02:40.214
<v Speaker 1>so it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at what point in time do you get to </v>

2607
02:02:42.651 --> 02:02:43.880
<v Speaker 1>speak your mind?</v>

2608
02:02:43.910 --> 02:02:44.743
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever get to say What you really </v>

2609
02:02:46.191 --> 02:02:47.750
<v Speaker 1>think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that's what he really thinks.</v>

2610
02:02:47.751 --> 02:02:51.500
<v Speaker 1>If that's who we really is it when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a politician,</v>

2611
02:02:52.010 --> 02:02:57.010
<v Speaker 1>you are almost required to try to play </v>
<v Speaker 1>this game of not pissing people off,</v>

2612
02:02:59.180 --> 02:03:03.400
<v Speaker 1>over expressing your true feelings on </v>
<v Speaker 1>things like you.</v>

2613
02:03:03.401 --> 02:03:05.750
<v Speaker 1>You've got to kind of play it as MuCh </v>
<v Speaker 1>down The middle.</v>

2614
02:03:05.751 --> 02:03:06.584
<v Speaker 1>You know that there's going to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of people on this side that are </v>

2615
02:03:07.881 --> 02:03:08.714
<v Speaker 1>going to hate you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be a bunch of people on </v>

2616
02:03:09.651 --> 02:03:11.270
<v Speaker 1>that side that don't think you're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>far enough,</v>

2617
02:03:11.540 --> 02:03:14.510
<v Speaker 1>but you shoot down the middle and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>get the best results.</v>

2618
02:03:15.170 --> 02:03:16.003
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like pretending to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who you're not to try to pick </v>

2619
02:03:18.351 --> 02:03:22.520
<v Speaker 1>people up at a bar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's a bullshit act and that's what</v>

2620
02:03:22.521 --> 02:03:24.800
<v Speaker 1>politicians are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're bullshitters there.</v>

2621
02:03:24.801 --> 02:03:25.634
<v Speaker 1>They're really good at bullshitting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's bizarre about trump is that he's </v>

2622
02:03:28.581 --> 02:03:31.490
<v Speaker 1>not doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is who he is.</v>

2623
02:03:31.930 --> 02:03:34.020
<v Speaker 2>I think that that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

2624
02:03:34.220 --> 02:03:37.200
<v Speaker 2>but I go to your point about where the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are stupid or not.</v>

2625
02:03:37.590 --> 02:03:40.110
<v Speaker 2>I think that's an unkind way of phrasing</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2626
02:03:40.560 --> 02:03:41.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm an uncommon dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2627
02:03:41.950 --> 02:03:44.580
<v Speaker 2>but actually no one has the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2628
02:03:44.630 --> 02:03:45.463
<v Speaker 2>we have jobs to do and to be informed on</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the subjects you would need to be </v>

2629
02:03:48.661 --> 02:03:52.910
<v Speaker 2>informed on to make the right decisions </v>
<v Speaker 2>to run the country you would.</v>

2630
02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:54.780
<v Speaker 2>No one has the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So very good point.</v>

2631
02:03:54.781 --> 02:03:55.614
<v Speaker 2>We need people to specialize in these </v>
<v Speaker 2>things and it's like brexit was a </v>

2632
02:03:58.591 --> 02:03:59.980
<v Speaker 2>triumph of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2633
02:03:59.981 --> 02:04:02.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the uk when it was put to the vote,</v>

2634
02:04:02.191 --> 02:04:04.410
<v Speaker 2>this massive decision whether to be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>eu.</v>

2635
02:04:04.770 --> 02:04:05.603
<v Speaker 2>No one in that space of time as a member</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the electorate could educate </v>

2636
02:04:09.061 --> 02:04:13.290
<v Speaker 2>themselves to the point where they could</v>
<v Speaker 2>make an informed choice on and so people</v>

2637
02:04:13.291 --> 02:04:14.160
<v Speaker 2>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

2638
02:04:14.161 --> 02:04:16.680
<v Speaker 2>I just want to have something different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's vote for a change.</v>

2639
02:04:16.681 --> 02:04:19.530
<v Speaker 2>And we had brexit with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would argue,</v>

2640
02:04:19.531 --> 02:04:20.880
<v Speaker 2>disastrous results</v>

2641
02:04:21.560 --> 02:04:22.393
<v Speaker 1>temporarily disastrous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to be seen whether or not it was </v>

2642
02:04:28.140 --> 02:04:32.060
<v Speaker 1>disastrous friend steve hilton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who a very bright guy who's been on this</v>

2643
02:04:32.061 --> 02:04:34.490
<v Speaker 1>podcast before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was david cameron's righthand man.</v>

2644
02:04:34.850 --> 02:04:35.683
<v Speaker 1>He actually is a supporter of brexit and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the things that he had a </v>

2645
02:04:37.921 --> 02:04:40.110
<v Speaker 1>problem with cameron over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had a falling out.</v>

2646
02:04:40.480 --> 02:04:41.550
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk to him,</v>

2647
02:04:41.551 --> 02:04:43.200
<v Speaker 1>sit down with him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know enough of it.</v>

2648
02:04:43.201 --> 02:04:46.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't really follow any politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I barely follow the United States.</v>

2649
02:04:46.660 --> 02:04:47.493
<v Speaker 1>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know what the fuck brexit was </v>

2650
02:04:48.811 --> 02:04:51.090
<v Speaker 1>until it was going down and everybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>was saying is the end of the world.</v>

2651
02:04:51.730 --> 02:04:52.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2652
02:04:53.100 --> 02:04:53.933
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I feel as though it's easy to go </v>

2653
02:04:56.401 --> 02:05:00.230
<v Speaker 1>along with the group think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

2654
02:05:01.980 --> 02:05:03.660
<v Speaker 1>I was in favor of staying in europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2655
02:05:03.661 --> 02:05:04.494
<v Speaker 1>when I'm talking about representative </v>
<v Speaker 1>government when I'm talking about is </v>

2656
02:05:06.571 --> 02:05:07.404
<v Speaker 1>like this electoral college set up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the one person one vote set up and that </v>

2657
02:05:13.460 --> 02:05:14.293
<v Speaker 1>the idea that 300 plus million people </v>
<v Speaker 1>are going to be represented by just a </v>

2658
02:05:18.601 --> 02:05:19.530
<v Speaker 1>handful of people.</v>

2659
02:05:19.530 --> 02:05:20.880
<v Speaker 1>I agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2660
02:05:20.881 --> 02:05:24.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean the whole way in which bernie </v>
<v Speaker 1>saunders was marginalized I think,</v>

2661
02:05:25.280 --> 02:05:29.280
<v Speaker 1>and likewise in a way the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump could run away with it.</v>

2662
02:05:29.281 --> 02:05:32.330
<v Speaker 1>It's me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just fascinating how he managed opt</v>

2663
02:05:32.480 --> 02:05:34.720
<v Speaker 1>overturned the apple cart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hadn't,</v>

2664
02:05:34.810 --> 02:05:35.643
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't really grappled with the </v>

2665
02:05:36.091 --> 02:05:36.924
<v Speaker 1>minutia of how us democracy works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it seems to me like it's a really </v>

2666
02:05:40.470 --> 02:05:43.950
<v Speaker 1>bizarre arcane system with delegates and</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatnot.</v>

2667
02:05:44.010 --> 02:05:45.480
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who came up with that?</v>

2668
02:05:45.600 --> 02:05:47.760
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they caMe up with it back when there was</v>

2669
02:05:47.761 --> 02:05:48.594
<v Speaker 1>nO communication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they came up with it back when you </v>

2670
02:05:50.581 --> 02:05:51.414
<v Speaker 1>had to take a horse and you had to carry</v>
<v Speaker 1>a handwritten letter across the country </v>

2671
02:05:54.241 --> 02:05:57.390
<v Speaker 1>to communicate with people and that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>just ineffective.</v>

2672
02:05:57.600 --> 02:05:58.433
<v Speaker 1>They had to figure out how to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>people in your various states and </v>

2673
02:06:01.201 --> 02:06:05.190
<v Speaker 1>various counties and various districts </v>
<v Speaker 1>represent the greater good of the people</v>

2674
02:06:05.191 --> 02:06:09.210
<v Speaker 1>and also have the ability to decide over</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of the people.</v>

2675
02:06:09.450 --> 02:06:10.283
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't even realize in representative </v>

2676
02:06:11.941 --> 02:06:12.774
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you have this one person who </v>

2677
02:06:14.071 --> 02:06:16.170
<v Speaker 1>represents a group of the people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the group of the people,</v>

2678
02:06:16.380 --> 02:06:18.690
<v Speaker 1>the group decides to vote for hillary </v>
<v Speaker 1>clinton,</v>

2679
02:06:18.691 --> 02:06:20.370
<v Speaker 1>that one person doesn't have to agree </v>
<v Speaker 1>with that.</v>

2680
02:06:20.910 --> 02:06:21.743
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>funky system and it's designed for back </v>

2681
02:06:24.691 --> 02:06:25.524
<v Speaker 1>when people were illiterate and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of farmers and pilgrims and </v>

2682
02:06:29.251 --> 02:06:30.084
<v Speaker 1>savages that came over from europe on </v>
<v Speaker 1>rafts and made it to America and just </v>

2683
02:06:34.620 --> 02:06:35.453
<v Speaker 1>fucking have at it and they're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to manage this and trying to to </v>

2684
02:06:39.290 --> 02:06:40.123
<v Speaker 1>try to figure out how to take the </v>
<v Speaker 1>founder fathers ideas and best keep it </v>

2685
02:06:45.181 --> 02:06:46.014
<v Speaker 1>all together while they're exploring </v>
<v Speaker 1>this whole new world and dealing with </v>

2686
02:06:50.460 --> 02:06:51.293
<v Speaker 1>governing these people that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>literally thousands of miles away that </v>

2687
02:06:53.581 --> 02:06:57.300
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't even reach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can do that now instantaneously.</v>

2688
02:06:57.301 --> 02:06:58.920
<v Speaker 1>Someone can send a facebook message.</v>

2689
02:06:59.160 --> 02:07:00.390
<v Speaker 1>They can send an email,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can,</v>

2690
02:07:00.420 --> 02:07:01.253
<v Speaker 1>they can tweet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can find out what people's opinions </v>

2691
02:07:03.091 --> 02:07:05.490
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then it becomes whether or not these</v>

2692
02:07:05.491 --> 02:07:10.140
<v Speaker 1>people are qualified to decide which </v>
<v Speaker 1>direction the country goes.</v>

2693
02:07:10.680 --> 02:07:12.090
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're not qualified,</v>

2694
02:07:12.091 --> 02:07:16.800
<v Speaker 1>we should probably figure out what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck we can do to make people more aware</v>

2695
02:07:17.010 --> 02:07:20.550
<v Speaker 1>of what are the consequences of all </v>
<v Speaker 1>these different decisions that are going</v>

2696
02:07:20.551 --> 02:07:21.384
<v Speaker 1>to be made by our politicians because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of stuff that gets made </v>

2697
02:07:25.830 --> 02:07:28.440
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to disasters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>implications for the environment.</v>

2698
02:07:28.441 --> 02:07:31.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean when obama was in office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he.</v>

2699
02:07:31.030 --> 02:07:31.863
<v Speaker 1>He is set so much in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in order are so much in motion that </v>

2700
02:07:37.630 --> 02:07:41.860
<v Speaker 1>environmentalists and people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>against offshore drilling.</v>

2701
02:07:42.080 --> 02:07:42.913
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a lot of fracking and </v>
<v Speaker 1>offshore drilling and all sorts of </v>

2702
02:07:45.311 --> 02:07:46.144
<v Speaker 1>things that could potentially have </v>
<v Speaker 1>disastrous implications that were set </v>

2703
02:07:50.021 --> 02:07:53.740
<v Speaker 1>forth by him that no one had any say in </v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2704
02:07:53.741 --> 02:07:54.574
<v Speaker 1>No person in America that it was just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>regular citizen had any say in these </v>

2705
02:07:58.571 --> 02:08:00.430
<v Speaker 1>major decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2706
02:08:00.550 --> 02:08:01.383
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mark ruffalo just tweeted something </v>

2707
02:08:02.501 --> 02:08:03.334
<v Speaker 1>about all the different offshore oil </v>
<v Speaker 1>rigs that obama had agreed to while he </v>

2708
02:08:09.281 --> 02:08:11.320
<v Speaker 1>was in office.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's disturbing really.</v>

2709
02:08:11.380 --> 02:08:11.940
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

2710
02:08:11.940 --> 02:08:13.020
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to say,</v>

2711
02:08:13.021 --> 02:08:14.430
<v Speaker 2>is it someone who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2712
02:08:14.431 --> 02:08:15.264
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who resides in the uk and more used to </v>

2713
02:08:17.191 --> 02:08:18.024
<v Speaker 2>the british system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the biggest shock when you come over </v>

2714
02:08:20.791 --> 02:08:21.624
<v Speaker 2>here is during the election cycle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the amount of money that gets spent and </v>

2715
02:08:24.571 --> 02:08:25.404
<v Speaker 2>the length of the campaigns and for all </v>
<v Speaker 2>its flaws and in britain there's a cap </v>

2716
02:08:30.121 --> 02:08:32.010
<v Speaker 2>on how much they can spend on their </v>
<v Speaker 2>campaign.</v>

2717
02:08:32.011 --> 02:08:36.480
<v Speaker 2>So they have like one or two tv ads each</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then a couple of posters,</v>

2718
02:08:36.481 --> 02:08:37.314
<v Speaker 2>but they do not do anything on the scale</v>
<v Speaker 2>of what happens here and the amount of </v>

2719
02:08:40.801 --> 02:08:43.080
<v Speaker 2>money that gets spent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's just insane.</v>

2720
02:08:43.680 --> 02:08:44.513
<v Speaker 2>So it does seem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has all the hallmarks of a broken </v>

2721
02:08:46.321 --> 02:08:47.460
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say.</v>

2722
02:08:47.600 --> 02:08:48.351
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only that,</v>

2723
02:08:48.351 --> 02:08:51.050
<v Speaker 1>there's two recognized parties in </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything else.</v>

2724
02:08:51.051 --> 02:08:52.700
<v Speaker 1>You're throwing your vote away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the,</v>

2725
02:08:52.710 --> 02:08:54.050
<v Speaker 1>that's the implication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what,</v>

2726
02:08:54.051 --> 02:08:55.980
<v Speaker 1>that's how people think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

2727
02:08:56.010 --> 02:08:56.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2728
02:08:57.140 --> 02:08:57.973
<v Speaker 1>tom rhodes friend of mine was in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he lived in holland for quite a quite a </v>

2729
02:09:01.671 --> 02:09:02.504
<v Speaker 1>while and he was talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>variety of candidates to choose from in </v>

2730
02:09:05.541 --> 02:09:08.390
<v Speaker 1>holland and now they just have so many </v>
<v Speaker 1>different people.</v>

2731
02:09:08.660 --> 02:09:09.493
<v Speaker 1>They have conservative liberals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have conservative green party </v>

2732
02:09:11.901 --> 02:09:12.734
<v Speaker 1>candidates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have liberal green party </v>

2733
02:09:13.851 --> 02:09:14.684
<v Speaker 1>candidates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have,</v>

2734
02:09:14.930 --> 02:09:15.763
<v Speaker 1>I mean it just goes across this wide </v>
<v Speaker 1>range of different philosophies on how </v>

2735
02:09:20.331 --> 02:09:21.164
<v Speaker 1>to govern and people get a better sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>of what would they would like or what </v>

2736
02:09:25.971 --> 02:09:28.790
<v Speaker 1>they agree with most because this hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>line,</v>

2737
02:09:28.791 --> 02:09:29.624
<v Speaker 1>right and hard line left in this rigid </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideology that you have to subscribe to </v>

2738
02:09:33.201 --> 02:09:35.420
<v Speaker 1>on both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're on the right,</v>

2739
02:09:35.421 --> 02:09:38.030
<v Speaker 1>you don't support gay marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're antiabortion,</v>

2740
02:09:38.080 --> 02:09:39.020
<v Speaker 1>you're this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're that,</v>

2741
02:09:39.021 --> 02:09:40.760
<v Speaker 1>you want gun rights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want this,</v>

2742
02:09:40.790 --> 02:09:43.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck immigration,</v>

2743
02:09:43.461 --> 02:09:44.294
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's all this stuff that you have to </v>

2744
02:09:45.411 --> 02:09:47.570
<v Speaker 1>kind of agree to if you agree to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2745
02:09:47.780 --> 02:09:48.613
<v Speaker 1>And then on the left you have to agree </v>
<v Speaker 1>to a lot of things that people may not </v>

2746
02:09:52.011 --> 02:09:54.820
<v Speaker 1>necessarily agree as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

2747
02:09:54.830 --> 02:09:55.663
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so complicated to have a two party </v>

2748
02:09:57.411 --> 02:10:01.580
<v Speaker 1>system and try to pretend that there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>real democracy that is.</v>

2749
02:10:01.740 --> 02:10:04.700
<v Speaker 1>And it's not really democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So representative governor.</v>

2750
02:10:04.800 --> 02:10:06.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's,</v>

2751
02:10:06.110 --> 02:10:06.943
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think trump's got a chance of </v>

2752
02:10:08.521 --> 02:10:08.830
<v Speaker 2>winning?</v>

2753
02:10:08.830 --> 02:10:09.790
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

2754
02:10:09.791 --> 02:10:14.290
<v Speaker 1>Especially if if people find out what </v>
<v Speaker 1>hillary has really been involved in,</v>

2755
02:10:14.590 --> 02:10:16.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean if they really start hammering </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2756
02:10:16.350 --> 02:10:16.601
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

2757
02:10:16.601 --> 02:10:18.880
<v Speaker 1>we've a few months to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's only august.</v>

2758
02:10:19.090 --> 02:10:22.870
<v Speaker 1>We have to go through all of september,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of october and then november.</v>

2759
02:10:23.350 --> 02:10:26.440
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of time and in that time </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy shit can come out</v>

2760
02:10:26.510 --> 02:10:27.343
<v Speaker 2>and it seems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've read in the la times that </v>

2761
02:10:29.091 --> 02:10:34.091
<v Speaker 2>he's already on a mini rebound based on </v>
<v Speaker 2>this semi he delivered last week</v>

2762
02:10:34.490 --> 02:10:35.323
<v Speaker 3>and that if he could tone it down a </v>
<v Speaker 3>couple of notches and just sort of </v>

2763
02:10:39.111 --> 02:10:43.100
<v Speaker 3>appeal to a few more women just seem a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit less insane.</v>

2764
02:10:43.210 --> 02:10:45.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He will climb in the poll numbers,</v>

2765
02:10:45.470 --> 02:10:48.650
<v Speaker 3>he could do it while she's under to </v>
<v Speaker 3>criminal investigations.</v>

2766
02:10:48.651 --> 02:10:49.484
<v Speaker 3>And there's also plenty of video out </v>
<v Speaker 3>there where there's a direct </v>

2767
02:10:51.501 --> 02:10:52.334
<v Speaker 3>contradiction between what the fbi has </v>
<v Speaker 3>said they were investigating what she </v>

2768
02:10:55.431 --> 02:10:58.340
<v Speaker 3>was guilty of and then what she has said</v>
<v Speaker 3>they said.</v>

2769
02:10:58.580 --> 02:11:01.010
<v Speaker 3>So she's not honest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's just not.</v>

2770
02:11:01.400 --> 02:11:02.233
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's pretty clear when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>compare many things to what she said </v>

2771
02:11:06.201 --> 02:11:09.320
<v Speaker 3>versus the actual facts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just she's a lawyer,</v>

2772
02:11:09.470 --> 02:11:13.310
<v Speaker 3>she's a lawyer who became a politician.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's a career politician.</v>

2773
02:11:13.311 --> 02:11:14.540
<v Speaker 3>She knows what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's,</v>

2774
02:11:14.840 --> 02:11:18.980
<v Speaker 3>she's got teflon and her dna and she </v>
<v Speaker 3>keeps plowing forward no matter what.</v>

2775
02:11:18.981 --> 02:11:21.590
<v Speaker 3>She doesn't do interviews,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's not doing these rallies.</v>

2776
02:11:21.590 --> 02:11:23.780
<v Speaker 3>She's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's just going forward.</v>

2777
02:11:23.781 --> 02:11:26.240
<v Speaker 3>And It's very bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 3>this also a lot of questions.</v>

2778
02:11:26.241 --> 02:11:27.074
<v Speaker 3>I mean dr drew did some big thing the </v>
<v Speaker 3>other day talking about her health </v>

2779
02:11:30.350 --> 02:11:31.183
<v Speaker 3>because she had fallen down in 2012 and </v>
<v Speaker 3>apparently like had a blood clot in her </v>

2780
02:11:35.091 --> 02:11:38.870
<v Speaker 3>brain and really hurt herself really </v>
<v Speaker 3>badly and it her advanced age,</v>

2781
02:11:38.871 --> 02:11:39.704
<v Speaker 3>this is a really dangerous condition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he talked about her healthcare and </v>

2782
02:11:42.711 --> 02:11:45.950
<v Speaker 3>talked about the care that she received </v>
<v Speaker 3>and what the diagnosis was.</v>

2783
02:11:45.951 --> 02:11:47.120
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not.</v>

2784
02:11:47.340 --> 02:11:52.160
<v Speaker 3>This is dangerous stuff and so who knows</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much of her behavior,</v>

2785
02:11:52.170 --> 02:11:53.003
<v Speaker 3>because traumatic brain injuries are </v>
<v Speaker 3>really significant when it comes to the </v>

2786
02:11:55.791 --> 02:12:00.710
<v Speaker 3>way your brain works post injury,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although the way you behave,</v>

2787
02:12:01.220 --> 02:12:03.040
<v Speaker 3>impulsive behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2788
02:12:03.080 --> 02:12:06.050
<v Speaker 3>I made a prediction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I made a program on that subject.</v>

2789
02:12:06.140 --> 02:12:08.330
<v Speaker 3>Did you last year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was it about?</v>

2790
02:12:08.860 --> 02:12:09.980
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was cold,</v>

2791
02:12:10.010 --> 02:12:12.300
<v Speaker 3>it was cold,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a different brain and it was,</v>

2792
02:12:12.360 --> 02:12:13.193
<v Speaker 3>it was set in a brain injury </v>
<v Speaker 3>rehabilitation clinic in the uk and it </v>

2793
02:12:16.401 --> 02:12:20.450
<v Speaker 3>was basically about serious personality </v>
<v Speaker 3>changes in the wake of a traumatic brain</v>

2794
02:12:20.451 --> 02:12:22.580
<v Speaker 3>injury,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you say,</v>

2795
02:12:22.581 --> 02:12:23.660
<v Speaker 3>impulsivity.</v>

2796
02:12:23.710 --> 02:12:25.670
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes a lack of empathy,</v>

2797
02:12:26.540 --> 02:12:30.110
<v Speaker 3>erratic behavior and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was about a god.</v>

2798
02:12:30.260 --> 02:12:31.093
<v Speaker 3>People inevitably is about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationships that they're in and the </v>

2799
02:12:34.161 --> 02:12:38.660
<v Speaker 3>way in which people have to adapt around</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the new needs and you know.</v>

2800
02:12:38.720 --> 02:12:39.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

2801
02:12:39.620 --> 02:12:41.540
<v Speaker 3>it's unbelievable stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2802
02:12:41.541 --> 02:12:42.231
<v Speaker 3>you told you about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2803
02:12:42.231 --> 02:12:43.064
<v Speaker 3>you know better than anyone from those </v>
<v Speaker 3>sports kind of interest that I'm post </v>

<v Speaker 3>if you're a fighter in hockey team and </v>
<v Speaker 3>pr pro wrestling too,</v>

2807
02:12:53.660 --> 02:12:55.610
<v Speaker 3>there's Been several terrific </v>
<v Speaker 3>documentaries.</v>

2808
02:12:55.611 --> 02:13:00.611
<v Speaker 3>One by steve james cold,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm head games and a few others that all</v>

2809
02:13:00.870 --> 02:13:05.870
<v Speaker 3>examine the levels of erratic behavior </v>
<v Speaker 3>after an nfl career.</v>

2810
02:13:06.200 --> 02:13:09.230
<v Speaker 3>Unreal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's divorce,</v>

<v Speaker 3>or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2813
02:13:12.200 --> 02:13:14.390
<v Speaker 3>serious depression.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's off the charts.</v>

2814
02:13:14.570 --> 02:13:15.291
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2815
02:13:15.291 --> 02:13:16.124
<v Speaker 3>I've seen it firsthand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen it firsthand from friends who </v>

2816
02:13:19.220 --> 02:13:20.053
<v Speaker 3>became erratic and became really </v>
<v Speaker 3>unstable after getting beat a few times </v>

2817
02:13:24.051 --> 02:13:26.840
<v Speaker 3>in mixed martial arts fights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen it from boxers,</v>

2818
02:13:26.841 --> 02:13:29.210
<v Speaker 3>people that I knew when I was young and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then I met them 10,</v>

2819
02:13:29.211 --> 02:13:31.740
<v Speaker 3>15 years later and they were just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Life was a mass.</v>

2820
02:13:31.741 --> 02:13:32.100
<v Speaker 3>They become.</v>

2821
02:13:32.100 --> 02:13:32.933
<v Speaker 1>Alcoholics have a huge issue with their </v>
<v Speaker 1>endocrine system and they supplement </v>

2822
02:13:37.531 --> 02:13:40.440
<v Speaker 1>with alcohol and drugs to try to self </v>
<v Speaker 1>medicate.</v>

2823
02:13:40.980 --> 02:13:44.430
<v Speaker 1>It becoMes a real problem in the brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>is very fragile.</v>

2824
02:13:44.431 --> 02:13:47.190
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's connected with this very,</v>

2825
02:13:47.191 --> 02:13:50.850
<v Speaker 1>very sOft connective tissue that keeps </v>
<v Speaker 1>it in place inside the head.</v>

2826
02:13:50.851 --> 02:13:53.670
<v Speaker 1>It's just not meant to be hit that much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2827
02:13:53.671 --> 02:13:57.070
<v Speaker 1>you're meant to like survive a few bumps</v>
<v Speaker 1>and bruises and that's what it's kind of</v>

2828
02:13:57.090 --> 02:13:58.740
<v Speaker 1>designed for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And anything else,</v>

2829
02:13:59.130 --> 02:13:59.963
<v Speaker 1>especially prolonged continued abuse </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that can have dire consequences or </v>

2830
02:14:04.530 --> 02:14:07.800
<v Speaker 1>one significant injury can have dire </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>

2831
02:14:07.870 --> 02:14:08.703
<v Speaker 1>The one significant one that can be life</v>
<v Speaker 1>changing or in the sports context to </v>

2832
02:14:12.450 --> 02:14:13.283
<v Speaker 1>concussions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you know back to back within a </v>

2833
02:14:14.731 --> 02:14:15.564
<v Speaker 1>single sort of space of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like one game you're the first one is </v>

2834
02:14:18.531 --> 02:14:19.364
<v Speaker 1>not good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the second one is cataclysmic </v>

2835
02:14:21.480 --> 02:14:22.313
<v Speaker 1>happens a lot of times where people deny</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first concussion and they go right </v>

2836
02:14:24.811 --> 02:14:27.540
<v Speaker 1>back to playing football or they go </v>
<v Speaker 1>right back to sparring.</v>

2837
02:14:27.990 --> 02:14:32.610
<v Speaker 1>It's a huge issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think hillary may have a tbi,</v>

2838
02:14:32.880 --> 02:14:34.530
<v Speaker 1>traumatic brain injury?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2839
02:14:34.710 --> 02:14:38.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm no doctor obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she definitely had a traumatic brain</v>

2840
02:14:38.641 --> 02:14:41.280
<v Speaker 1>injury.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She fell and she had a blood clot in her</v>

2841
02:14:41.281 --> 02:14:42.114
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is all open public record </v>

2842
02:14:43.741 --> 02:14:46.500
<v Speaker 1>that diagnosis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you have a blood clot on your brain</v>

2843
02:14:46.501 --> 02:14:50.160
<v Speaker 1>at 60 something years of age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is incredibly dangerous.</v>

2844
02:14:50.460 --> 02:14:51.293
<v Speaker 1>It's really bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to dress like what </v>

2845
02:14:53.041 --> 02:14:53.874
<v Speaker 1>made her pass out in the first place?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what made her black out when she </v>

2846
02:14:56.341 --> 02:14:58.620
<v Speaker 1>fell down and hit her head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not good.</v>

2847
02:14:58.920 --> 02:14:59.753
<v Speaker 1>I think what we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we really need in this country is </v>

2848
02:15:02.611 --> 02:15:07.060
<v Speaker 1>like some altruistic elan musk type </v>
<v Speaker 1>character,</v>

2849
02:15:07.061 --> 02:15:07.894
<v Speaker 1>some real genius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone who's like a really brilliant </v>

2850
02:15:10.531 --> 02:15:11.364
<v Speaker 1>person who sees the state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the country's in and offErs some </v>

2851
02:15:14.791 --> 02:15:15.624
<v Speaker 1>intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well thought out solutions that doesn't </v>

2852
02:15:18.481 --> 02:15:21.360
<v Speaker 1>exist because those people are too busy </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing whatever they're doing.</v>

2853
02:15:21.450 --> 02:15:25.400
<v Speaker 1>So what we're left with his career </v>
<v Speaker 1>politicians and then this madman.</v>

2854
02:15:25.410 --> 02:15:28.440
<v Speaker 1>Who's a reality tv star,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a casino man.</v>

2855
02:15:29.160 --> 02:15:32.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that our system is good.</v>

2856
02:15:32.880 --> 02:15:33.713
<v Speaker 1>I think it's very archaic and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just not the best we can do and I </v>

2857
02:15:38.041 --> 02:15:41.610
<v Speaker 1>think we're just going to continue to </v>
<v Speaker 1>use it until it blows up in our face.</v>

2858
02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:42.833
<v Speaker 1>It's like instead of redesigning cars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got some model t and we're keep </v>

2859
02:15:45.871 --> 02:15:50.070
<v Speaker 1>adding turbo chargers to it and fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger wheels and someone says,</v>

2860
02:15:50.071 --> 02:15:51.870
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we can make a better car.</v>

2861
02:15:51.871 --> 02:15:54.320
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is our car usa,</v>

2862
02:15:54.360 --> 02:15:55.780
<v Speaker 1>usa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they keep.</v>

2863
02:15:56.060 --> 02:15:56.893
<v Speaker 1>They keep slapping bolts and fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>rivets and screwing this thing in place </v>

2864
02:16:00.811 --> 02:16:01.644
<v Speaker 1>and it's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a good system and it's not the </v>

2865
02:16:03.991 --> 02:16:04.824
<v Speaker 1>best we can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly not ideal and I think </v>

2866
02:16:06.361 --> 02:16:10.320
<v Speaker 1>human beings in all areas of life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other than our political system,</v>

2867
02:16:10.620 --> 02:16:13.470
<v Speaker 1>we have advanced radically since the 17 </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds.</v>

2868
02:16:13.710 --> 02:16:17.340
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the way we approach </v>
<v Speaker 1>education,</v>

2869
02:16:17.550 --> 02:16:19.890
<v Speaker 1>if you look at our ability to </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate with each other,</v>

2870
02:16:19.891 --> 02:16:22.210
<v Speaker 1>you look at technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the innovation and the,</v>

2871
02:16:22.211 --> 02:16:22.581
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2872
02:16:22.581 --> 02:16:23.414
<v Speaker 1>the constant expanding of our horizons </v>
<v Speaker 1>and possibilities as far as what we're </v>

2873
02:16:26.881 --> 02:16:27.714
<v Speaker 1>capable of with technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All those things radically improved </v>

2874
02:16:30.101 --> 02:16:32.860
<v Speaker 1>since then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we still have this goofy system that</v>

2875
02:16:32.861 --> 02:16:36.220
<v Speaker 1>was created back when people rode.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Horses wrote with feathers.</v>

2876
02:16:36.430 --> 02:16:38.250
<v Speaker 1>And when you wanted a picture of </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

2877
02:16:38.260 --> 02:16:39.880
<v Speaker 1>you had to draw it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2878
02:16:39.910 --> 02:16:41.470
<v Speaker 1>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is done.</v>

2879
02:16:41.650 --> 02:16:42.483
<v Speaker 2>But that's great because that's a great </v>
<v Speaker 2>metaphor for the human brain in a way </v>

2880
02:16:44.851 --> 02:16:47.560
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and kind of a big thought to carry us as</v>

2881
02:16:47.561 --> 02:16:50.770
<v Speaker 2>we sort of Georgia the closer barbecue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

2882
02:16:51.010 --> 02:16:52.840
<v Speaker 2>because that is the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2883
02:16:53.590 --> 02:16:55.810
<v Speaker 2>our brains are hinged around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2884
02:16:56.080 --> 02:16:58.270
<v Speaker 2>the of most parts of our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of our brain,</v>

2885
02:16:58.271 --> 02:16:59.104
<v Speaker 2>the amygdala,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is essentially reptilian in </v>

2886
02:17:00.731 --> 02:17:01.541
<v Speaker 2>origin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2887
02:17:01.541 --> 02:17:02.374
<v Speaker 2>and so many of our deepest impulses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fear response and so forth are </v>

2888
02:17:06.881 --> 02:17:10.000
<v Speaker 2>programmed from a kind of evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 2>heritage.</v>

2889
02:17:10.001 --> 02:17:10.834
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got neurocircuits that go back </v>

2890
02:17:13.060 --> 02:17:16.260
<v Speaker 2>thousands if not millions of years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

2891
02:17:16.300 --> 02:17:17.133
<v Speaker 2>that metaphor you use to describe our </v>
<v Speaker 2>political system of being an old jalopy </v>

2892
02:17:19.751 --> 02:17:23.320
<v Speaker 2>that's been turbocharged is in essence </v>
<v Speaker 2>what our brains are.</v>

2893
02:17:23.321 --> 02:17:25.510
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as muCh as it would be lovely to believe</v>

2894
02:17:25.511 --> 02:17:26.344
<v Speaker 2>that technology and our ability to </v>
<v Speaker 2>control nature and control our </v>

2895
02:17:29.081 --> 02:17:33.880
<v Speaker 2>environment had been hand in hand with </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of a moral and civilizational,</v>

2896
02:17:34.380 --> 02:17:35.213
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>improvement that you could deduce maybe </v>

2897
02:17:38.171 --> 02:17:39.004
<v Speaker 2>as many examples that suggests that all </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's done is allowed us to do </v>

2898
02:17:43.960 --> 02:17:46.630
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether for good or ill more efficiently</v>

2899
02:17:46.631 --> 02:17:49.360
<v Speaker 2>and more effectively.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we can help more people,</v>

2900
02:17:49.361 --> 02:17:52.030
<v Speaker 2>we can blow more people up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can drive faster,</v>

2901
02:17:52.031 --> 02:17:54.160
<v Speaker 2>but you can drive faster away from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>crime.</v>

2902
02:17:54.220 --> 02:17:55.660
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2903
02:17:55.690 --> 02:17:58.750
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't hold out any huge hope,</v>

2904
02:17:58.830 --> 02:18:03.430
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there'll be a positive change.</v>

2905
02:18:03.460 --> 02:18:04.840
<v Speaker 2>We also see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

2906
02:18:04.870 --> 02:18:06.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might be wrong sometimes I read things</v>

2907
02:18:06.701 --> 02:18:07.534
<v Speaker 2>that persuade me otherwise</v>

2908
02:18:07.760 --> 02:18:11.430
<v Speaker 1>I think that were more advanced and more</v>
<v Speaker 1>safe now than ever before.</v>

2909
02:18:11.431 --> 02:18:13.620
<v Speaker 1>I think if you look back on 2000 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>

2910
02:18:13.621 --> 02:18:14.454
<v Speaker 1>when you look at today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is just a blink of the eye in </v>

2911
02:18:15.571 --> 02:18:16.404
<v Speaker 1>terms of the age of the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's infinitely better to live today </v>

2912
02:18:19.171 --> 02:18:19.800
<v Speaker 1>than it is</v>

2913
02:18:19.800 --> 02:18:22.170
<v Speaker 2>certainly here in America or in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>west.</v>

2914
02:18:22.171 --> 02:18:23.020
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in an,</v>

2915
02:18:23.080 --> 02:18:25.650
<v Speaker 2>in a global six,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it 6 billion?</v>

2916
02:18:25.760 --> 02:18:27.060
<v Speaker 2>So I think it's seven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you were going to,</v>

2917
02:18:27.150 --> 02:18:30.540
<v Speaker 2>if you were dropped at random on earth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where would you wear?</v>

2918
02:18:30.541 --> 02:18:32.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chances are You wouldn't be joe rogan.</v>

2919
02:18:32.371 --> 02:18:36.030
<v Speaker 2>You would probably be what I would you </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably be.</v>

2920
02:18:36.060 --> 02:18:41.060
<v Speaker 2>Well there's places makIng apple phones </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a factory.</v>

2921
02:18:41.160 --> 02:18:41.993
<v Speaker 1>You could be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you could be in China living in some </v>

2922
02:18:44.011 --> 02:18:44.844
<v Speaker 1>sky rise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being some multibillionaire cell phone </v>

2923
02:18:49.020 --> 02:18:51.240
<v Speaker 1>magnate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who the hell knows,</v>

2924
02:18:51.330 --> 02:18:51.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2925
02:18:51.940 --> 02:18:55.800
<v Speaker 1>there's certainly some wonderful spots </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world outside of America.</v>

2926
02:18:55.870 --> 02:18:57.390
<v Speaker 1>There's certainly some great places to </v>
<v Speaker 1>live.</v>

2927
02:18:57.391 --> 02:19:00.450
<v Speaker 1>Even if you live in poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could live a wonderful,</v>

2928
02:19:00.451 --> 02:19:01.284
<v Speaker 1>happy life that's way safer than it </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be thousands and thousands of </v>

2929
02:19:04.741 --> 02:19:07.140
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The internet is pretty much worldwide.</v>

2930
02:19:07.960 --> 02:19:10.740
<v Speaker 1>Cell phones are pretty much available </v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere now.</v>

2931
02:19:10.920 --> 02:19:14.490
<v Speaker 1>And so I think that access to </v>
<v Speaker 1>communication is going to change the way</v>

2932
02:19:14.491 --> 02:19:17.880
<v Speaker 1>people view the world because they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to have more data to choose from.</v>

2933
02:19:17.881 --> 02:19:20.850
<v Speaker 1>They're gonna have more cherry picking </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they can do.</v>

2934
02:19:20.851 --> 02:19:24.240
<v Speaker 1>They can certainly have more </v>
<v Speaker 1>confirmation bias and stick to their own</v>

2935
02:19:24.241 --> 02:19:25.074
<v Speaker 1>group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we're talking about when </v>

2936
02:19:25.891 --> 02:19:26.724
<v Speaker 1>scientologists who don't go on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>internet and don't take any suppressive </v>

2937
02:19:29.211 --> 02:19:32.210
<v Speaker 1>information and don't watch any videos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think,</v>

2938
02:19:32.211 --> 02:19:33.044
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what I'd like about your </v>

2939
02:19:35.181 --> 02:19:36.014
<v Speaker 1>approach and what I like about what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're saying when it comes to </v>

2940
02:19:37.971 --> 02:19:40.280
<v Speaker 1>scientology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you're not a mean person.</v>

2941
02:19:40.281 --> 02:19:42.800
<v Speaker 1>You're not like mocking them and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to shit on them.</v>

2942
02:19:43.070 --> 02:19:47.000
<v Speaker 1>What you want to do is you want to look </v>
<v Speaker 1>at them for what they really are and try</v>

2943
02:19:47.001 --> 02:19:47.834
<v Speaker 1>to get a real good understanding of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of my favorite parts of the trailer </v>

2944
02:19:51.140 --> 02:19:54.050
<v Speaker 1>was that guy filming you and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>filming him and you go,</v>

2945
02:19:54.180 --> 02:19:55.760
<v Speaker 1>are you making a documentary too?</v>

2946
02:19:56.670 --> 02:19:57.910
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's it,</v>

2947
02:19:57.911 --> 02:19:59.370
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you don't want to,</v>

2948
02:19:59.371 --> 02:20:01.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I can quote nature,</v>

2949
02:20:01.660 --> 02:20:03.490
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of a sophomore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do,</v>

2950
02:20:03.491 --> 02:20:06.760
<v Speaker 2>but it's the idea of like you do when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you were.</v>

2951
02:20:06.830 --> 02:20:08.860
<v Speaker 2>When you look into the obesity of </v>
<v Speaker 2>bisquick sold to and to you,</v>

2952
02:20:08.861 --> 02:20:12.070
<v Speaker 2>like when you fiGht monsters don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>become a monster and I don't want to.</v>

2953
02:20:12.380 --> 02:20:13.213
<v Speaker 2>They're the bullies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In many cases I didn't want to bully </v>

2954
02:20:15.611 --> 02:20:16.444
<v Speaker 2>them back and I didn't want to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>trapped into a paradigm of us against </v>

2955
02:20:19.541 --> 02:20:22.210
<v Speaker 2>them and I was really trying to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2956
02:20:22.211 --> 02:20:23.310
<v Speaker 2>let's keep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want.</v>

2957
02:20:23.311 --> 02:20:25.360
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to see the human in you,</v>

2958
02:20:26.080 --> 02:20:29.050
<v Speaker 2>not just an agent for an oppressive </v>
<v Speaker 2>regime.</v>

2959
02:20:29.140 --> 02:20:30.610
<v Speaker 2>I think that's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I reallY do</v>

2960
02:20:30.630 --> 02:20:35.510
<v Speaker 1>do and I think that is a very measured </v>
<v Speaker 1>and intelligent and wise way to approach</v>

2961
02:20:35.511 --> 02:20:38.570
<v Speaker 1>this and I I've enjoyed that about your </v>
<v Speaker 1>other videos as well.</v>

2962
02:20:38.900 --> 02:20:39.733
<v Speaker 1>I think in that Sense you're very unique</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the way you approach documentary </v>

2963
02:20:43.220 --> 02:20:46.460
<v Speaker 1>filmmaking and I think the </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientologists,</v>

2964
02:20:46.490 --> 02:20:49.190
<v Speaker 1>they're not our enemies and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>gentleman who left,</v>

2965
02:20:49.191 --> 02:20:50.520
<v Speaker 1>who was the number two guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was his name?</v>

2966
02:20:51.320 --> 02:20:52.153
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a perfect example that you're </v>

2967
02:20:53.001 --> 02:20:53.834
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A guy who was in it for two plus </v>

2968
02:20:54.951 --> 02:20:55.784
<v Speaker 1>decades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he left and he's sort of coming clean </v>

2969
02:20:58.341 --> 02:21:00.320
<v Speaker 1>about all the stupid shit that he did </v>
<v Speaker 1>when he was in there.</v>

2970
02:21:00.590 --> 02:21:04.820
<v Speaker 1>People become a prisoner of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>earliest ideology,</v>

2971
02:21:05.400 --> 02:21:06.233
<v Speaker 1>the earliest ideology that they adopt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's one of the problems with any </v>

2972
02:21:09.351 --> 02:21:11.960
<v Speaker 1>sort of a group think whether it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cult,</v>

2973
02:21:12.010 --> 02:21:13.640
<v Speaker 1>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck you want to call it,</v>

2974
02:21:14.270 --> 02:21:17.270
<v Speaker 1>ideologies become problematic when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't escape.</v>

2975
02:21:17.300 --> 02:21:18.860
<v Speaker 1>You can't vary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't.</v>

2976
02:21:18.920 --> 02:21:19.753
<v Speaker 1>You have to stick to the dogma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to stick to the doctrine and </v>

2977
02:21:23.720 --> 02:21:26.180
<v Speaker 1>that's not good for people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not healthy.</v>

2978
02:21:26.210 --> 02:21:27.043
<v Speaker 1>It's not smart because I think the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to communicate and open debate </v>

2979
02:21:30.770 --> 02:21:33.950
<v Speaker 1>is why we've advanced to the point we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>at in the first place.</v>

2980
02:21:34.190 --> 02:21:38.390
<v Speaker 1>The suppressing of that is almost always</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who has a bad idea.</v>

2981
02:21:38.660 --> 02:21:39.493
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to shelter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you see people that are chasing </v>

2982
02:21:41.541 --> 02:21:42.374
<v Speaker 1>after someone because they're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate about something like you </v>

2983
02:21:45.710 --> 02:21:48.820
<v Speaker 1>who's doing it super diy respectfully,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

2984
02:21:48.890 --> 02:21:49.723
<v Speaker 1>when you see that what you have is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of people that are trying to </v>

2985
02:21:52.071 --> 02:21:55.280
<v Speaker 1>defend a bad idea and defend it with </v>
<v Speaker 1>aggression.</v>

2986
02:21:55.370 --> 02:21:55.630
<v Speaker 1>Exactly</v>

2987
02:21:55.630 --> 02:21:56.463
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if the more you kind of become a </v>

2988
02:21:59.131 --> 02:22:02.190
<v Speaker 2>mirror image of whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever they're projecting,</v>

2989
02:22:02.220 --> 02:22:03.053
<v Speaker 2>you reinforce them in that position as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well as from doing other stories about </v>

2990
02:22:06.541 --> 02:22:09.210
<v Speaker 2>extreme religious beliefs like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>westboro baptist church.</v>

2991
02:22:09.211 --> 02:22:10.044
<v Speaker 2>I know from people who I met who were in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the church when I made my documentary </v>

2992
02:22:13.411 --> 02:22:16.470
<v Speaker 2>and then subsequently left that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2993
02:22:16.471 --> 02:22:21.360
<v Speaker 2>what short circuits their beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what allows them to see something bigger</v>

2994
02:22:21.361 --> 02:22:24.330
<v Speaker 2>than what they're in is when you treat </v>
<v Speaker 2>them with kindness,</v>

2995
02:22:24.350 --> 02:22:25.183
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and instead of shouting back at them or </v>

2996
02:22:28.140 --> 02:22:28.973
<v Speaker 2>hurling abuse back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which just reinforces their view of you </v>

2997
02:22:31.831 --> 02:22:35.970
<v Speaker 2>as an enemy of god or suppressive or </v>
<v Speaker 2>however they characterize it,</v>

2998
02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:36.833
<v Speaker 2>if you actually behave decently and </v>
<v Speaker 2>attempt to robustly present your </v>

2999
02:22:40.501 --> 02:22:41.334
<v Speaker 2>position,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in a respectful way and with a kind </v>

3000
02:22:43.291 --> 02:22:48.291
<v Speaker 2>of coming from a place of caring and </v>
<v Speaker 2>empathy as opposed to sort of sense,</v>

3001
02:22:48.780 --> 02:22:53.780
<v Speaker 2>so hostile attitude that actually can be</v>
<v Speaker 2>much more effective.</v>

3002
02:22:54.390 --> 02:22:55.230
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3003
02:22:55.231 --> 02:22:57.810
<v Speaker 2>as well as being humane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kudos to you sir.</v>
