00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.670
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience,</v>

2
00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:01.821
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3
00:00:01.821 --> 00:00:06.620
<v Speaker 1>like we always argue that marijuana is a mild hallucinogenic and you know,</v>

4
00:00:06.621 --> 00:00:07.454
<v Speaker 1>therefore,</v>

5
00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:09.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6
00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:09.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7
00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.090
<v Speaker 1>a safer and fun or alternative to being drunk and necessarily or blah,</v>

8
00:00:14.091 --> 00:00:14.211
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

9
00:00:14.211 --> 00:00:14.720
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>

10
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:15.650
<v Speaker 1>As Louis Armstrong said,</v>

11
00:00:15.651 --> 00:00:16.250
<v Speaker 1>what it's worth,</v>

12
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:17.690
<v Speaker 1>it's worth a hundred assistants,</v>

13
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

14
00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:20.450
<v Speaker 1>worth a hundred assistance.</v>

15
00:00:20.451 --> 00:00:21.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

16
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.680
<v Speaker 1>When you said eight,</v>

17
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:22.101
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

18
00:00:22.101 --> 00:00:22.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

19
00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:23.091
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>

20
00:00:23.091 --> 00:00:24.860
<v Speaker 1>He would have said it's better than a hundred whiskeys.</v>

21
00:00:24.861 --> 00:00:25.430
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

22
00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.250
<v Speaker 1>He said he always considered it a friend and assistant.</v>

23
00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:28.700
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

24
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:29.180
<v Speaker 1>that's funny.</v>

25
00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:30.170
<v Speaker 1>Which I thought was really funny,</v>

26
00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:30.760
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

27
00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:31.970
<v Speaker 1>but psychedelics are like,</v>

28
00:00:31.971 --> 00:00:32.391
<v Speaker 1>if you say,</v>

29
00:00:32.391 --> 00:00:33.350
<v Speaker 1>if you took psychedelics,</v>

30
00:00:33.351 --> 00:00:33.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

31
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:34.753
<v Speaker 1>people go,</v>

32
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:36.111
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

33
00:00:36.111 --> 00:00:36.944
<v Speaker 1>you're a drug addict.</v>

34
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.891
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

35
00:00:37.891 --> 00:00:38.611
<v Speaker 1>if you smoke weed,</v>

36
00:00:38.611 --> 00:00:39.444
<v Speaker 1>you're a pothead.</v>

37
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:40.523
<v Speaker 1>You know what I am,</v>

38
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.030
<v Speaker 1>I am as well.</v>

39
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.160
<v Speaker 1>But what I found out that you were,</v>

40
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:44.641
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

41
00:00:44.641 --> 00:00:45.361
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

42
00:00:45.361 --> 00:00:45.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

43
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.931
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

44
00:00:45.931 --> 00:00:46.051
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

45
00:00:46.051 --> 00:00:49.620
<v Speaker 1>I found out that you were the one who actually did you introduce Doug Benson to</v>

46
00:00:49.621 --> 00:00:50.454
<v Speaker 1>marijuana?</v>

47
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.293
<v Speaker 1>That's the legend.</v>

48
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.510
<v Speaker 1>If you saw that Werner Herzog movie,</v>

49
00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:55.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

50
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.520
<v Speaker 1>it's written on one of the cave walls.</v>

51
00:00:56.521 --> 00:00:57.354
<v Speaker 1>There's this,</v>

52
00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.540
<v Speaker 1>there's a Petroglyph of Doug and I stylized.</v>

53
00:01:00.541 --> 00:01:00.961
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

54
00:01:00.961 --> 00:01:02.160
<v Speaker 1>you can't hardly recognize it.</v>

55
00:01:02.161 --> 00:01:03.120
<v Speaker 1>So you can see my glasses.</v>

56
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.090
<v Speaker 1>It's a from hundreds of years ago.</v>

57
00:01:06.091 --> 00:01:09.360
<v Speaker 1>And Doug and I were in San Diego at the Pacific Beach Improv.</v>

58
00:01:09.361 --> 00:01:10.200
<v Speaker 1>If you remember that one.</v>

59
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.561
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

60
00:01:10.561 --> 00:01:10.981
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

61
00:01:10.981 --> 00:01:12.930
<v Speaker 1>Well here was this 58,</v>

62
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:14.593
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

63
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.860
<v Speaker 1>we had just finished doing a roast at the friars [inaudible] we're playing San</v>

64
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.380
<v Speaker 1>Diego and he claims that he had smoked before,</v>

65
00:01:22.381 --> 00:01:23.071
<v Speaker 1>but knock on high,</v>

66
00:01:23.071 --> 00:01:23.521
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

67
00:01:23.521 --> 00:01:24.810
<v Speaker 1>Like he'd had some,</v>

68
00:01:24.811 --> 00:01:25.950
<v Speaker 1>so cause a lot of times,</v>

69
00:01:25.951 --> 00:01:26.161
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

70
00:01:26.161 --> 00:01:28.800
<v Speaker 1>you have to get high a few times before it kicks in.</v>

71
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.353
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

72
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.170
<v Speaker 1>and then I brought a bunch of weed and,</v>

73
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.390
<v Speaker 1>and I remember what I remember is the Condo was near the beach and we were just</v>

74
00:01:36.391 --> 00:01:38.250
<v Speaker 1>fucking doofuses and you know,</v>

75
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.560
<v Speaker 1>we would just go to the beach every day you get high.</v>

76
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.700
<v Speaker 1>And then when we weren't at the beach,</v>

77
00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:44.160
<v Speaker 1>we would watch MTVs beach party.</v>

78
00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:45.181
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

79
00:01:45.181 --> 00:01:48.360
<v Speaker 1>I remember him laying on the couch laughing hysterically at one point and</v>

80
00:01:48.361 --> 00:01:49.260
<v Speaker 1>kicking his legs in the air.</v>

81
00:01:49.261 --> 00:01:49.651
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

82
00:01:49.651 --> 00:01:50.730
<v Speaker 1>let's go get this tacos.</v>

83
00:01:50.731 --> 00:01:51.121
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>

84
00:01:51.121 --> 00:01:51.541
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

85
00:01:51.541 --> 00:01:51.781
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

86
00:01:51.781 --> 00:01:54.990
<v Speaker 1>and like it was just that stupid of that weekend.</v>

87
00:01:54.991 --> 00:01:55.141
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

88
00:01:55.141 --> 00:01:55.950
<v Speaker 1>let's fucking,</v>

89
00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.800
<v Speaker 1>and then at night we'd go desats we're working at the Improv.</v>

90
00:01:59.250 --> 00:01:59.551
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

91
00:01:59.551 --> 00:01:59.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

92
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.350
<v Speaker 1>he claims that was where he started.</v>

93
00:02:01.351 --> 00:02:06.351
<v Speaker 1>And I guess the carefree lifestyle that we were living that week seduced him so</v>

94
00:02:06.391 --> 00:02:10.800
<v Speaker 1>hard because if it's beguiling poetry that he realized he as an independent</v>

95
00:02:10.801 --> 00:02:11.131
<v Speaker 1>soul,</v>

96
00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:12.780
<v Speaker 1>he could finally take control of his own destiny.</v>

97
00:02:12.781 --> 00:02:17.010
<v Speaker 1>But I had a kid say to me once where I was on the road and like Addison,</v>

98
00:02:17.011 --> 00:02:20.490
<v Speaker 1>Texas or something and that the guy was working with a nice fellow and he would</v>

99
00:02:20.491 --> 00:02:23.580
<v Speaker 1>go out and you buy it like peanut that I ran like cereal that you'd see on TV</v>

100
00:02:23.581 --> 00:02:24.001
<v Speaker 1>and stuff,</v>

101
00:02:24.001 --> 00:02:25.710
<v Speaker 1>which made me laugh cause I'm from San Francisco,</v>

102
00:02:25.711 --> 00:02:25.921
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

103
00:02:25.921 --> 00:02:26.260
<v Speaker 1>and I'm like,</v>

104
00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.640
<v Speaker 1>he would come back with like what a shopping lists you'd see on television,</v>

105
00:02:29.641 --> 00:02:30.780
<v Speaker 1>like wonder bread and,</v>

106
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.400
<v Speaker 1>and he's a nice fellow.</v>

107
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:33.733
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

108
00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.591
<v Speaker 1>and he would,</v>

109
00:02:34.591 --> 00:02:35.790
<v Speaker 1>he would run and whatnot.</v>

110
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:36.630
<v Speaker 1>And I was late.</v>

111
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:37.620
<v Speaker 1>I remember what year it was.</v>

112
00:02:37.621 --> 00:02:37.801
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

113
00:02:37.801 --> 00:02:41.730
<v Speaker 1>I was watching the needed hill hearings on TV and that was a Raiders game that</v>

114
00:02:41.731 --> 00:02:44.550
<v Speaker 1>weekend or niners game and there was a fire in the East Bay and you can see the</v>

115
00:02:44.551 --> 00:02:47.670
<v Speaker 1>fire [inaudible] was 90 90 91 somewhere in there,</v>

116
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:49.531
<v Speaker 1>laying on the couch,</v>

117
00:02:49.531 --> 00:02:50.221
<v Speaker 1>smoking weed,</v>

118
00:02:50.221 --> 00:02:51.054
<v Speaker 1>and he goes,</v>

119
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.950
<v Speaker 1>you're going to smoke pot all fucking day proofs.</v>

120
00:02:52.951 --> 00:02:53.784
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>

121
00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:54.990
<v Speaker 1>let me ask you something.</v>

122
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.681
<v Speaker 1>Whatever his name was,</v>

123
00:02:55.681 --> 00:02:56.514
<v Speaker 1>Danny,</v>

124
00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:57.443
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

125
00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.010
<v Speaker 1>let me ask you something.</v>

126
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.000
<v Speaker 1>Who kills every night and you,</v>

127
00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.183
<v Speaker 1>you do</v>

128
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:05.800
<v Speaker 1>you have your program?</v>

129
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:07.211
<v Speaker 1>Well people,</v>

130
00:03:07.211 --> 00:03:07.991
<v Speaker 1>his board too.</v>

131
00:03:07.991 --> 00:03:09.130
<v Speaker 1>I was trapped in the condo.</v>

132
00:03:09.131 --> 00:03:09.710
<v Speaker 1>There was no,</v>

133
00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:11.680
<v Speaker 1>it was one of those ones that wasn't near anything.</v>

134
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.120
<v Speaker 1>I think a waffle house or something.</v>

135
00:03:13.121 --> 00:03:18.121
<v Speaker 1>But if you wanted it to be tactical about like a comics time creating,</v>

136
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.510
<v Speaker 1>it's all day and it's all day watching TV and you're,</v>

137
00:03:21.511 --> 00:03:25.120
<v Speaker 1>you could be scanning for something that inspires you enough to be your next</v>

138
00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:25.954
<v Speaker 1>closing bit.</v>

139
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:27.160
<v Speaker 1>So you're actually working.</v>

140
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:28.900
<v Speaker 1>So even when you're lounging,</v>

141
00:03:28.901 --> 00:03:29.734
<v Speaker 1>you're working.</v>

142
00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.360
<v Speaker 1>I think of Stephanie and Dad,</v>

143
00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:32.471
<v Speaker 1>I man,</v>

144
00:03:32.471 --> 00:03:32.710
<v Speaker 1>Dad,</v>

145
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:34.150
<v Speaker 1>and if I wake up in the middle of the night,</v>

146
00:03:34.151 --> 00:03:34.870
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

147
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.060
<v Speaker 1>I need to do the thing tomorrow.</v>

148
00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.420
<v Speaker 1>I have to think of this.</v>

149
00:03:37.421 --> 00:03:39.400
<v Speaker 1>And then I think of it and you know,</v>

150
00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:42.160
<v Speaker 1>I would argue that the creative process,</v>

151
00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:43.660
<v Speaker 1>you can manufacture it.</v>

152
00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:44.583
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

153
00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.190
<v Speaker 1>But it works better if you down.</v>

154
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:48.191
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

155
00:03:48.191 --> 00:03:49.024
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

156
00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.900
<v Speaker 1>everybody goes dry.</v>

157
00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:50.980
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you get to drive it.</v>

158
00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.080
<v Speaker 1>Also working hard makes you not go dry.</v>

159
00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:54.071
<v Speaker 1>That's true too.</v>

160
00:03:54.071 --> 00:03:54.904
<v Speaker 1>It's a muscle.</v>

161
00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

162
00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:56.161
<v Speaker 1>I think the,</v>

163
00:03:56.161 --> 00:03:56.600
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

164
00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.400
<v Speaker 1>there's like a vibe that you get into when you're really writing a lot and that</v>

165
00:04:00.401 --> 00:04:01.660
<v Speaker 1>vibe sort of like,</v>

166
00:04:01.661 --> 00:04:02.040
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>

167
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.250
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

168
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.740
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

169
00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.420
<v Speaker 1>it becomes like a part of your consciousness and then the,</v>

170
00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.690
<v Speaker 1>the more you feed it and the more you do it,</v>

171
00:04:07.691 --> 00:04:09.820
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what the thing with everything,</v>

172
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.481
<v Speaker 1>every,</v>

173
00:04:10.481 --> 00:04:11.770
<v Speaker 1>everything that a person does,</v>

174
00:04:11.771 --> 00:04:14.500
<v Speaker 1>whether it's an art form or a musical instrument,</v>

175
00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.520
<v Speaker 1>and if it isn't an art form,</v>

176
00:04:15.521 --> 00:04:16.390
<v Speaker 1>it's not important Joe,</v>

177
00:04:16.391 --> 00:04:16.870
<v Speaker 1>but go on.</v>

178
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:17.140
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>

179
00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.973
<v Speaker 1>It is true.</v>

180
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:18.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

181
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.270
<v Speaker 1>The idea of the creative process is something that's always been so fascinating</v>

182
00:04:22.271 --> 00:04:22.541
<v Speaker 1>to me.</v>

183
00:04:22.541 --> 00:04:22.810
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>

184
00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.760
<v Speaker 1>I love listening to how other people do it.</v>

185
00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.110
<v Speaker 1>And especially comics,</v>

186
00:04:26.111 --> 00:04:27.490
<v Speaker 1>like some of them are just fucking,</v>

187
00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.040
<v Speaker 1>they just sit down and put in the time.</v>

188
00:04:30.041 --> 00:04:34.630
<v Speaker 1>They just put in the hours and some of them just sit around and watch things all</v>

189
00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.690
<v Speaker 1>day and scratch their head and look at the Internet and just poke around and</v>

190
00:04:37.691 --> 00:04:38.524
<v Speaker 1>prod,</v>

191
00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:39.491
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

192
00:04:39.491 --> 00:04:41.200
<v Speaker 1>and then some of them,</v>

193
00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.831
<v Speaker 1>they just,</v>

194
00:04:41.831 --> 00:04:42.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

195
00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.380
<v Speaker 1>they just write in and stand up for them.</v>

196
00:04:44.381 --> 00:04:45.880
<v Speaker 1>Some people write in blog form,</v>

197
00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.990
<v Speaker 1>don't you love when you think a joke springs fully formed from your breast and</v>

198
00:04:52.601 --> 00:04:53.620
<v Speaker 1>you haven't thought of it.</v>

199
00:04:53.621 --> 00:04:56.590
<v Speaker 1>It just comes out and you do it and it's perfect and you go,</v>

200
00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:57.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

201
00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:58.390
<v Speaker 1>like people always say,</v>

202
00:04:58.391 --> 00:04:59.224
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

203
00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.580
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

204
00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:00.413
<v Speaker 1>the Beatles,</v>

205
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:01.390
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

206
00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:02.320
<v Speaker 1>how did you write that song?</v>

207
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.280
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes they'll go,</v>

208
00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.233
<v Speaker 1>honestly,</v>

209
00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:05.830
<v Speaker 1>I sat down and it,</v>

210
00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:06.963
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

211
00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.810
<v Speaker 1>I had it,</v>

212
00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:08.650
<v Speaker 1>I didn't write it.</v>

213
00:05:08.651 --> 00:05:09.210
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

214
00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.950
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

215
00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:14.890
<v Speaker 1>came out and like every once in a while there'll be a joke that you think of and</v>

216
00:05:14.891 --> 00:05:16.510
<v Speaker 1>it's just the right one.</v>

217
00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.630
<v Speaker 1>And it made it not be like genius or anything.</v>

218
00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.240
<v Speaker 1>It's just that feeling of when it um,</v>

219
00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:24.010
<v Speaker 1>that your,</v>

220
00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:28.870
<v Speaker 1>that your subconscious pushed it out and you weren't fucking with it in any way</v>

221
00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.070
<v Speaker 1>and therefore it's,</v>

222
00:05:30.071 --> 00:05:32.170
<v Speaker 1>perfection is different than something you worked on.</v>

223
00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:32.921
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

224
00:05:32.921 --> 00:05:34.570
<v Speaker 1>There's this weird thing of,</v>

225
00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:36.250
<v Speaker 1>again it goes back to the ego,</v>

226
00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.960
<v Speaker 1>this weird thing of what whoever the fuck you think of yourself as,</v>

227
00:05:40.961 --> 00:05:41.231
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

228
00:05:41.231 --> 00:05:44.020
<v Speaker 1>this self defining sort of image that,</v>

229
00:05:44.021 --> 00:05:44.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

230
00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.110
<v Speaker 1>you put up as like sort of a wall for tuck very much.</v>

231
00:05:47.111 --> 00:05:47.411
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

232
00:05:47.411 --> 00:05:49.960
<v Speaker 1>And when you want to take credit for the idea,</v>

233
00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:50.803
<v Speaker 1>what would,</v>

234
00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:51.970
<v Speaker 1>the way creativity comes,</v>

235
00:05:51.971 --> 00:05:54.290
<v Speaker 1>it comes when you're in the state of like,</v>

236
00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.770
<v Speaker 1>like open when you're open to receive it.</v>

237
00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:00.140
<v Speaker 1>When you're really thinking about things like completely all your resources are</v>

238
00:06:00.141 --> 00:06:00.974
<v Speaker 1>on the thing.</v>

239
00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:02.150
<v Speaker 1>Not about the bullshit,</v>

240
00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:06.290
<v Speaker 1>not about like trying to craft an image on stage or trying to formulate</v>

241
00:06:06.291 --> 00:06:09.860
<v Speaker 1>something that you think is going to make the back of the room laugh and of that</v>

242
00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:13.850
<v Speaker 1>it's all coming from like a true openness.</v>

243
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:14.811
<v Speaker 1>And then they did.</v>

244
00:06:14.811 --> 00:06:16.760
<v Speaker 1>It just comes like as you,</v>

245
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.100
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it's just like moments,</v>

246
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:19.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

247
00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:20.090
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

248
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:23.450
<v Speaker 1>these bursts of ideas will come to you and they are just gifts from the</v>

249
00:06:23.451 --> 00:06:26.240
<v Speaker 1>university and they hit you like waves and you can't even write them down quick</v>

250
00:06:26.241 --> 00:06:27.700
<v Speaker 1>enough and you're giggling while you're writing on it.</v>

251
00:06:27.701 --> 00:06:28.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

252
00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:29.420
<v Speaker 1>And it's like a gift.</v>

253
00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:33.710
<v Speaker 1>It's like a gift for thinking the right way or a gift for approaching it with</v>

254
00:06:33.711 --> 00:06:35.000
<v Speaker 1>the correct respect.</v>

255
00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.630
<v Speaker 1>Like realizing that you are the lucky one to be able to tune into this.</v>

256
00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:42.800
<v Speaker 1>It's not that you're this fabulous person who you know is so awesome because you</v>

257
00:06:42.801 --> 00:06:43.581
<v Speaker 1>say funny shit.</v>

258
00:06:43.581 --> 00:06:43.730
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

259
00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:48.200
<v Speaker 1>you're the lucky one that has found this ability to tune into these ideas and</v>

260
00:06:48.201 --> 00:06:51.200
<v Speaker 1>you should praise these ideas and honor these ideas.</v>

261
00:06:51.201 --> 00:06:52.034
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>

262
00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.220
<v Speaker 1>I think just pushing yourself to think of something.</v>

263
00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:57.320
<v Speaker 1>I repeat myself a million times,</v>

264
00:06:57.321 --> 00:06:59.270
<v Speaker 1>but to think of something new when you're riffing.</v>

265
00:06:59.420 --> 00:06:59.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

266
00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.220
<v Speaker 1>It's how I hard.</v>

267
00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:02.363
<v Speaker 1>That's really hard.</v>

268
00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:04.100
<v Speaker 1>Like on the podcast,</v>

269
00:07:04.101 --> 00:07:04.640
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

270
00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:05.240
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

271
00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.570
<v Speaker 1>I'll just attempt things sometimes that aren't that funny,</v>

272
00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:09.800
<v Speaker 1>but I'm like trying to,</v>

273
00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:11.143
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

274
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:12.950
<v Speaker 1>like disconnect.</v>

275
00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:14.001
<v Speaker 1>So that you're,</v>

276
00:07:14.001 --> 00:07:15.380
<v Speaker 1>you're kind of trying to automatic,</v>

277
00:07:15.381 --> 00:07:15.651
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

278
00:07:15.651 --> 00:07:16.484
<v Speaker 1>If you can,</v>

279
00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:46.350
<v Speaker 1>you're a fucking human being.</v>
