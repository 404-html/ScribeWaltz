62
00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.280

63
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.090
<v Speaker 2>Did you know that if two white guys go </v>
<v Speaker 2>head to head that they're allowed to say</v>

64
00:03:16.091 --> 00:03:18.600
<v Speaker 2>the n word once each?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

66
00:03:19.091 --> 00:03:24.091
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They allowed to allow me to put their </v>

67
00:03:24.091 --> 00:03:27.781
<v Speaker 2>phones in a basket when they go into </v>
<v Speaker 2>that because someday someone's going to </v>

68
00:03:27.781 --> 00:03:30.430
<v Speaker 2>be on stage and the people that are like</v>

<v Speaker 2>super progressive blog that gets US </v>

70
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.450
<v Speaker 2>radio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure Brian said something about it </v>

71
00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:39.450
<v Speaker 2>the other night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

73
00:03:40.121 --> 00:03:42.820
<v Speaker 2>get the fuck outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happened on a blog?</v>

74
00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.910
<v Speaker 2>Somebody wrote about like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the n the n word is thrown </v>

75
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.770
<v Speaker 2>around a lot in that room from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whites only from the black guys,</v>

76
00:03:50.771 --> 00:03:55.210
<v Speaker 2>from the judges,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the all Negro wave crew.</v>

77
00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.780
<v Speaker 2>They say it a lot and who is the was </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody went home and blogged about it.</v>

78
00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:59.870
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

79
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.830
<v Speaker 2>As that's how it goes down now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Los Angeles,</v>

80
00:04:02.831 --> 00:04:07.831
<v Speaker 2>the comedy store giving white comics as </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're saying,</v>

81
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.010
<v Speaker 2>it's gotten more professional at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy store,</v>

82
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.220
<v Speaker 2>but that's so far old school that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so funny that someone,</v>

83
00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:20.490
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's someone just doesn't get what </v>

84
00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:21.400
<v Speaker 2>they're doing at a place like the comedy</v>
<v Speaker 2>store in a show like the roast battle,</v>

85
00:04:21.401 --> 00:04:25.510
<v Speaker 2>like the whole point of the thing is </v>
<v Speaker 2>pushing it over the top way over the top</v>

86
00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.620
<v Speaker 2>in the most ridiculous unrealistic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one's actually saying that it's </v>

87
00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.550
<v Speaker 2>almost the white section is almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>progress.</v>

88
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.760
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing is pretty much progress </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a lot of ways,</v>

89
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.120
<v Speaker 2>which is one of the reasons why </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hinchcliffe fucking loves it.</v>

90
00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.160
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Love it.</v>

91
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.680
<v Speaker 2>Great God damn show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I went there for that and then I went</v>

92
00:04:47.681 --> 00:04:51.010
<v Speaker 2>there for red taping of his show and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was just too fun.</v>

93
00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.150
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to come back.</v>

94
00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.180
<v Speaker 2>It just doesn't seem like what I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>running from the old school vibe is </v>

95
00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.580
<v Speaker 2>there again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like just,</v>

96
00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:59.410
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just really cool.</v>

97
00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.000
<v Speaker 2>It's like Swanky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>classy and,</v>

98
00:05:03.001 --> 00:05:06.010
<v Speaker 2>but kinda dirty and down and out at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same time.</v>

99
00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.920
<v Speaker 2>There's just no place like that and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>felt it when I was there.</v>

100
00:05:08.921 --> 00:05:09.820
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this place,</v>

101
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.600
<v Speaker 2>there's something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

102
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:14.920
<v Speaker 2>it used to be Ciro's nightclub in the 19</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatevers,</v>

103
00:05:14.921 --> 00:05:19.921
<v Speaker 2>the early,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Bugsy Siegel owned it and the story </v>

104
00:05:19.921 --> 00:05:21.970
<v Speaker 2>that we always heard from everybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>there was at taunted and that a bunch of</v>

105
00:05:21.971 --> 00:05:26.971
<v Speaker 2>people had been killed there and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>say there's a sniper point in the green </v>

106
00:05:26.971 --> 00:05:29.170
<v Speaker 2>room looking down on them and well there</v>
<v Speaker 2>is not a sniper point,</v>

107
00:05:29.171 --> 00:05:30.940
<v Speaker 2>but there's a small window.</v>

108
00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.610
<v Speaker 2>But apparently it was like with Jerry </v>
<v Speaker 2>Lewis wanted,</v>

109
00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.210
<v Speaker 2>like Jerry Lewis wanted to watch the </v>
<v Speaker 2>opening act so you could,</v>

110
00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.530
<v Speaker 2>I guess know where they're at so he </v>
<v Speaker 2>could get nervous,</v>

111
00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she can get a view,</v>

112
00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:45.780
<v Speaker 2>see how everything's going right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like in case they didn't have cell </v>

113
00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:45.780
<v Speaker 2>phones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it couldn't tech somebody,</v>

114
00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:45.780
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

115
00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:47.500
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this fucking crowd sucks at Dick.</v>

116
00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:49.720
<v Speaker 2>He couldn't just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no way to let each other know.</v>

117
00:05:49.721 --> 00:05:50.380
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't call.</v>

119
00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:56.850
<v Speaker 2>a drunk guy in the front row.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I guess he just would watch the </v>

120
00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:57.890
<v Speaker 2>opening or maybe he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

121
00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.300
<v Speaker 1>he's insecure you opening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

122
00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:06.310
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's kinds of tell you to take it </v>

123
00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:08.201
<v Speaker 1>down a notch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got guys on the road like a work </v>

124
00:06:08.201 --> 00:06:08.201
<v Speaker 1>with guys and the guys tell him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

125
00:06:08.201 --> 00:06:10.040
<v Speaker 1>you're going a little too hard down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

126
00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:15.900
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had people tell me not to do </v>

127
00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:15.900
<v Speaker 1>certain jokes really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

128
00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.330
<v Speaker 1>that really didn't kill their jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

129
00:06:17.331 --> 00:06:17.810
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

130
00:06:17.811 --> 00:06:22.811
<v Speaker 1>well did they tell you not to do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I was just starting out and I had </v>

131
00:06:22.811 --> 00:06:26.711
<v Speaker 1>this closer and it was very hip hop </v>
<v Speaker 1>oriented and this guy and he's awesome </v>

132
00:06:26.711 --> 00:06:30.971
<v Speaker 1>comic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't even say who it is because I </v>

133
00:06:30.971 --> 00:06:30.971
<v Speaker 1>think he's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he was like,</v>

134
00:06:30.971 --> 00:06:35.231
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got one hip hop joke so you can't </v>

135
00:06:35.231 --> 00:06:36.971
<v Speaker 1>throw it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it really hurt me at the time </v>

136
00:06:36.971 --> 00:06:36.971
<v Speaker 1>because it's all I really had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

137
00:06:36.971 --> 00:06:38.060
<v Speaker 1>But that's life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't,</v>

138
00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:40.430
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't seem too bad.</v>

139
00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.680
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a tricky one man.</v>

140
00:06:42.681 --> 00:06:47.681
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've worked with guys before and they </v>

141
00:06:47.681 --> 00:06:48.020
<v Speaker 1>were opening for me and they touch on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same subject that I'm going to touch</v>

142
00:06:48.021 --> 00:06:53.021
<v Speaker 1>on later and so unless you already been </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing a bit and then the dude does it </v>

143
00:06:53.871 --> 00:06:56.900
<v Speaker 1>and he's opening for you and then it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kinda like you're paying someone to trip</v>

144
00:06:56.901 --> 00:06:58.730
<v Speaker 1>you up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

145
00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:00.130
<v Speaker 1>you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That can,</v>

146
00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:01.310
<v Speaker 1>that can be argued,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

147
00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:03.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we maybe it was,</v>

148
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:05.830
<v Speaker 1>it didn't harm is bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You said,</v>

149
00:07:05.831 --> 00:07:10.831
<v Speaker 1>no way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy is way too funny to have </v>

150
00:07:10.831 --> 00:07:11.240
<v Speaker 1>anything I say harm them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's just like a maybe a paranoia</v>

151
00:07:11.241 --> 00:07:12.850
<v Speaker 1>or something there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

152
00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:14.400
<v Speaker 1>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

153
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:19.600
<v Speaker 1>I was telling Brian earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like all the road trick is just to </v>

154
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:19.600
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

155
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.290
<v Speaker 1>Brian was talking about this earlier and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you do your fucking thing.</v>

156
00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:23.150
<v Speaker 1>That is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all you have to do.</v>

157
00:07:23.151 --> 00:07:23.770
<v Speaker 1>Real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

158
00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:25.150
<v Speaker 1>That's the road trick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

159
00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:30.160
<v Speaker 1>And that's a great way to segue into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't pretend that it wasn't already </v>

160
00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.640
<v Speaker 1>discussed exactly 40 minutes ago where </v>
<v Speaker 1>the subject wasn't.</v>

161
00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:32.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

162
00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian Cowen had a,</v>

163
00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:38.590
<v Speaker 1>an interaction with a guy on the road </v>
<v Speaker 1>once and it was,</v>

164
00:07:38.591 --> 00:07:43.591
<v Speaker 1>it was real weird because I was on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian's side because Brian's a great </v>

165
00:07:43.591 --> 00:07:44.360
<v Speaker 1>friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was also not on the side,</v>

166
00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:46.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard.</v>

167
00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:51.730
<v Speaker 1>He worked with some guy and the guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>opened for him and the guy apparently in</v>

168
00:07:52.461 --> 00:07:56.180
<v Speaker 1>the course of like his bombing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he wasn't doing so well,</v>

169
00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:01.990
<v Speaker 1>he started talking to the crowd and like</v>
<v Speaker 1>telling the crowd just some shit that </v>

170
00:08:03.381 --> 00:08:08.381
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just something about like the way they </v>

171
00:08:08.381 --> 00:08:10.980
<v Speaker 1>were reacting or the way the show is </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be for the rest of it.</v>

172
00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:15.980
<v Speaker 1>It was some non funny thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were just talking to them and Brian </v>

173
00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:15.980
<v Speaker 1>Goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing?</v>

174
00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:16.760
<v Speaker 1>Like why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are you just talking to them?</v>

175
00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:17.660
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

176
00:08:17.661 --> 00:08:18.980
<v Speaker 1>that's my time on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

177
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.010
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're opening up for me and you weird.</v>

178
00:08:21.011 --> 00:08:23.540
<v Speaker 1>And the whole crowd out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just like started bombing.</v>

179
00:08:23.541 --> 00:08:28.541
<v Speaker 1>Then he started talking about comedy or </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about why they're not laughing </v>

180
00:08:28.541 --> 00:08:29.720
<v Speaker 1>at you or whatever the fuck it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember specifically,</v>

181
00:08:29.721 --> 00:08:31.130
<v Speaker 1>but I remember thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

182
00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:34.280
<v Speaker 1>I kind of see both sides part like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy sucked,</v>

183
00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:35.930
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't doing well,</v>

184
00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:40.610
<v Speaker 1>but we all sucked at one point in time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how do you not suck?</v>

185
00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:44.210
<v Speaker 1>And that's also how you get past sucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to go.</v>

186
00:08:44.211 --> 00:08:46.040
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jokes are off the table.</v>

187
00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:48.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to talk like a regular </v>
<v Speaker 1>human being now.</v>

188
00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:53.320
<v Speaker 1>Sort of maybe your jokes are not funny </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

189
00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:56.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a bunch of things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you do,</v>

190
00:08:56.730 --> 00:09:01.730
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's weird when a guy tells you not to </v>

191
00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:01.730
<v Speaker 1>do something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is in you.</v>

192
00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:02.590
<v Speaker 1>Just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

193
00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:05.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the only thing that I could see.</v>

194
00:09:05.221 --> 00:09:07.950
<v Speaker 1>It's like what I said earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd say if you have your bit about uh,</v>

195
00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:11.010
<v Speaker 1>the Dolphin bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you had a guy who went on before</v>

196
00:09:11.011 --> 00:09:16.011
<v Speaker 1>you who also did like a super similar </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit about having sex with something like</v>

197
00:09:16.681 --> 00:09:18.090
<v Speaker 1>really similar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

198
00:09:18.091 --> 00:09:20.280
<v Speaker 1>like a monkey or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something smart,</v>

199
00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:23.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can be like super trippy.</v>

200
00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:24.870
<v Speaker 1>Like it would trip you up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meaning,</v>

201
00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:26.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you went up and did your bid,</v>

202
00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:30.300
<v Speaker 1>the whole premise has been kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>beaten down even if it's a different.</v>

203
00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:31.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

204
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:36.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's my dolphin bed actually </v>

205
00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:38.031
<v Speaker 3>started as a sex type joke about having </v>
<v Speaker 3>sex with a dolphin and then now it's </v>

206
00:09:38.031 --> 00:09:38.031
<v Speaker 3>nine</v>

207
00:09:38.031 --> 00:09:39.430
<v Speaker 1>has nothing to do with sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with adults.</v>

208
00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:44.480
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that interesting how that happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like when you come up with a bit </v>

209
00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.460
<v Speaker 1>like it starts off as like a seed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then from there it goes off and </v>

210
00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:51.150
<v Speaker 1>sometimes like just a tag line becomes a</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally different branch that becomes a </v>

211
00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:55.651
<v Speaker 1>totally different tree and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of the lines come from our </v>

212
00:09:55.651 --> 00:09:58.710
<v Speaker 1>eating didn't get a laugh at first and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're trying to save it and then </v>

213
00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:01.660
<v Speaker 1>you're on a totally different page in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just some weirdness in the room.</v>

214
00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:04.930
<v Speaker 1>You went left when you should've went </v>
<v Speaker 1>right and a new line just pops into your</v>

215
00:10:04.931 --> 00:10:05.880
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

216
00:10:05.881 --> 00:10:09.580
<v Speaker 1>Whatever weird reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I like the act of comedy,</v>

217
00:10:09.581 --> 00:10:12.100
<v Speaker 1>like creating comedy is so it's so </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated.</v>

218
00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:17.420
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one exactly knows where all that </v>

219
00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:19.351
<v Speaker 1>shit's coming from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like the only consistent thing </v>

220
00:10:19.351 --> 00:10:22.051
<v Speaker 1>that seems to work for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you just got to do a ton of </v>

221
00:10:22.051 --> 00:10:22.051
<v Speaker 1>sets.</v>

222
00:10:22.051 --> 00:10:22.051
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's about.</v>

223
00:10:22.051 --> 00:10:25.981
<v Speaker 1>It's about doing it because like you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>sit there and memorize your bit and </v>

224
00:10:25.981 --> 00:10:26.350
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got to go exactly like this.</v>

225
00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:28.900
<v Speaker 1>You do it exactly like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't go over that well.</v>

226
00:10:28.901 --> 00:10:33.901
<v Speaker 1>Then you start talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start riffing and all of a sudden </v>

227
00:10:33.901 --> 00:10:34.840
<v Speaker 1>all this stuff you just made up on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>spot is way funnier,</v>

228
00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:37.320
<v Speaker 1>way funnier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you need the audience there.</v>

229
00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:42.040
<v Speaker 1>Dick Sandwich sign.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it's Dick and poop on bread.</v>

230

247

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

250
00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:37.880
<v Speaker 3>because it could go really bad and it </v>

<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Luckily there was a lot of funny people </v>

252
00:11:42.881 --> 00:11:42.881

<v Speaker 3>was some of the worst comedy you ever.</v>

255
00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:52.990
<v Speaker 3>It's one of those words that guy's </v>

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

261
00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:01.120
<v Speaker 1>homeboys in a panic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it angry?</v>

262
00:12:01.121 --> 00:12:05.920
<v Speaker 1>It was just loud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>loud in just inexperienced and just like</v>

263
00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:08.110
<v Speaker 1>the audience just sat there and watched </v>
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>

264
00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:10.510
<v Speaker 1>but he was like trying to get them like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

265
00:12:10.511 --> 00:12:12.700
<v Speaker 1>you have to respond,</v>
<v Speaker 1>respond,</v>

266
00:12:12.701 --> 00:12:14.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was bullying,</v>

267
00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:16.480
<v Speaker 1>bullying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bullying.</v>

268
00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:17.770
<v Speaker 1>Well you know what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

269
00:12:17.771 --> 00:12:22.771
<v Speaker 1>It's just misguided energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just trying to get a result and </v>

270
00:12:22.771 --> 00:12:23.140
<v Speaker 1>it's just not happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he thinks that he's just really big.</v>

271
00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:26.050
<v Speaker 1>Like people will like watch some standup</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they go,</v>

272
00:12:26.051 --> 00:12:27.070
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know how to make it.</v>

273
00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:28.270
<v Speaker 1>I know how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

274
00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:33.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do with Kevin Hart's House.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to do that kind of thing </v>

275
00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:35.380
<v Speaker 1>and we'll just literally try to emulate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Kevin Hart's funny is his funny.</v>

276
00:12:35.381 --> 00:12:36.430
<v Speaker 1>He knows how to do that.</v>

277
00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:41.430
<v Speaker 1>Funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you try to do that funny it </v>

278
00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:43.561
<v Speaker 1>could fuck you up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And definitely it'll definitely like </v>

279
00:12:43.561 --> 00:12:45.820
<v Speaker 1>sort of hide what ever real funny is </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside of you.</v>

280
00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:49.720
<v Speaker 1>You'll be trying to be Dane Cook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll be trying to be Steve Byrne,</v>

281
00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:51.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoever it is that you think is funny.</v>

282
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:52.840
<v Speaker 1>And when you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

283
00:12:52.841 --> 00:12:54.730
<v Speaker 1>it can really fuck with your head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

284
00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:58.150
<v Speaker 1>It takes so many years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes longer and comedy than anything</v>

285
00:12:58.151 --> 00:12:58.750
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

286
00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:02.270
<v Speaker 1>Neurosurgery is probably weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Comedy,</v>

287
00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:04.600
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a bunch of things you do quicker</v>

288
00:13:04.601 --> 00:13:09.601
<v Speaker 1>than or they would take a way longer </v>
<v Speaker 1>time than being able to get a laugh </v>

289
00:13:09.601 --> 00:13:10.630
<v Speaker 1>consistently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're right about that,</v>

290
00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:14.260
<v Speaker 1>but doesn't it take most guys like three</v>
<v Speaker 1>years to even be somewhat funny?</v>

291
00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:19.290
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some didn't really funny out of the </v>

292
00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:19.290
<v Speaker 1>gate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like with her a couple of years.</v>

293
00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:22.531
<v Speaker 1>Like it depends on how much alcoholics </v>
<v Speaker 1>anonymous they've had up in front of </v>

294
00:13:22.531 --> 00:13:22.531
<v Speaker 1>those people and talk.</v>

295
00:13:22.531 --> 00:13:23.800
<v Speaker 1>How about substitute teaching?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've done,</v>

296
00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:27.910
<v Speaker 1>do we have guy back in Boston?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A rest his soul.</v>

297
00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:30.700
<v Speaker 1>He's passed since.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But his name is Dave Fitzgerald.</v>

298
00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:32.290
<v Speaker 1>And it was a funny guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

299
00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:36.100
<v Speaker 1>And he fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He learned how to do stand up completely</v>

300
00:13:36.101 --> 00:13:38.950
<v Speaker 1>from a do an alcoholics anonymous </v>
<v Speaker 1>speeches.</v>

301
00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:42.430
<v Speaker 1>He was a guy who like was longstanding </v>
<v Speaker 1>drunk,</v>

302
00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:44.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then got his shit together.</v>

303
00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:46.240
<v Speaker 1>Started doing stand up at these </v>
<v Speaker 1>meetings.</v>

304
00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:50.170
<v Speaker 1>Started telling us stories and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories were fucking hilarious.</v>

305
00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:53.830
<v Speaker 1>His stories of excess and just had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>great delivery and timing.</v>

306
00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:58.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That fucking guy was a solid </v>

307
00:13:58.890 --> 00:13:58.890
<v Speaker 1>professional like inside of a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>

308
00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:00.190
<v Speaker 1>He just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason,</v>

309
00:14:00.191 --> 00:14:02.980
<v Speaker 1>like we were all like marveling at him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the guy used to be a drunk,</v>

310
00:14:02.981 --> 00:14:05.070
<v Speaker 1>but look at how organized he is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

311
00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:08.590
<v Speaker 1>he's constantly performing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>networking and he got sick.</v>

312
00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:11.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't know whatever happened to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy but something,</v>

313
00:14:11.621 --> 00:14:12.880
<v Speaker 1>some cancer or something.</v>

314
00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:14.770
<v Speaker 1>He died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A couple of guys from Boston were really</v>

315
00:14:14.771 --> 00:14:15.820
<v Speaker 1>funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Died of cancer,</v>

316
00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:21.630
<v Speaker 1>but this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my point being that he did something </v>

317
00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:21.630
<v Speaker 1>else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you do something else,</v>

318
00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:23.650
<v Speaker 1>like some guys like uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like your buddy was in bands.</v>

<v Speaker 1>being in bands.</v>

322
00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:34.050
<v Speaker 1>He had a point about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like kind of understand what it's </v>

323
00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:36.400

<v Speaker 2>The one he and I did,</v>

365
00:16:07.731 --> 00:16:10.320
<v Speaker 2>it was just so good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's such a cool,</v>

366
00:16:10.321 --> 00:16:15.321
<v Speaker 2>like I love a classic standup comic book</v>
<v Speaker 2>that with the attitude and the authority</v>

367
00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:18.410
<v Speaker 2>and just the jokes and the whole deal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole deal,</v>

368
00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:20.260
<v Speaker 2>the whole deal just loved that car.</v>

369
00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:21.590
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

370
00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:26.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw him the other day to joey was </v>

371
00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:26.770
<v Speaker 2>there the other day at the comedy store </v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

372
00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:28.910
<v Speaker 2>It just felt great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It felt great to just be there.</v>

373
00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:31.040
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was watching the uh,</v>

374
00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:36.180
<v Speaker 2>I was watching the youtubes last night </v>
<v Speaker 2>with you fight and hosting the show </v>

375
00:16:36.981 --> 00:16:40.880
<v Speaker 2>tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would be hilarious.</v>

376
00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:43.940
<v Speaker 2>I almost asked you should ask.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if that would've been,</v>

377
00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:49.180
<v Speaker 2>it would've been the funny shit of all </v>
<v Speaker 2>time and say yet I was actually on that </v>

378
00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:52.181
<v Speaker 2>show that night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I opened up the show that you really </v>

379
00:16:52.181 --> 00:16:52.880
<v Speaker 2>have 2007.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a 2007,</v>

380
00:16:52.881 --> 00:16:55.890
<v Speaker 2>I believe it was February or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

381
00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.870
<v Speaker 2>I still have the seven page letter that </v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy sent me from the comedy store.</v>

382
00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:02.630
<v Speaker 2>So did you get in trouble with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy store after that?</v>

383
00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:07.010
<v Speaker 2>A little bit or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What exactly did they say?</v>

384
00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:09.850
<v Speaker 2>It's a long story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A guy behind it is gone.</v>

385
00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:11.270
<v Speaker 2>Gotcha.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all,</v>

386
00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:13.550
<v Speaker 2>it's different there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went there the other night too,</v>

387
00:17:13.551 --> 00:17:15.420
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when he was filming a special,</v>

388
00:17:15.421 --> 00:17:20.210
<v Speaker 2>I plopped myself down next to polly and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I almost shit myself because people were</v>

389
00:17:20.211 --> 00:17:20.570
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

390
00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:22.940
<v Speaker 2>go look inside this room right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I look over and I'm like,</v>

391
00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:23.600
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe?</v>

392
00:17:23.601 --> 00:17:26.180
<v Speaker 2>And polly's sitting there talking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I looked at him like,</v>

393
00:17:26.181 --> 00:17:29.120
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a problem with this dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go be friendly with this dude.</v>

394
00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:34.130
<v Speaker 2>I just sat down next time I shook his </v>
<v Speaker 2>hand and we had a nice little </v>

395
00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:34.130
<v Speaker 2>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have a nice little conversation about</v>

396
00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:36.680
<v Speaker 2>how happy he was that he was doing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>special in the original room.</v>

397
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:37.940
<v Speaker 2>Really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

398
00:17:37.941 --> 00:17:39.840
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a classic room and you know.</v>

399
00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:40.550
<v Speaker 2>And Paula was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

400
00:17:40.551 --> 00:17:45.551
<v Speaker 2>And he's so comfortable here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he was a nice little conversation </v>

401
00:17:45.551 --> 00:17:45.551
<v Speaker 2>we had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was good.</v>

402
00:17:45.551 --> 00:17:45.551
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's very.</v>

403
00:17:45.551 --> 00:17:49.290
<v Speaker 2>A poly is very matured now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like the more I lately</v>

404
00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:55.140
<v Speaker 1>I think it's totally unfair to judge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>judge,</v>

405
00:17:55.141 --> 00:17:59.100
<v Speaker 1>judge anybody based on who they were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you kind of know who they are.</v>

406
00:17:59.101 --> 00:18:04.101
<v Speaker 1>But to say that that's who you are that </v>
<v Speaker 1>defines you right now in this current </v>

407
00:18:04.101 --> 00:18:04.101
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty unfair,</v>

408
00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:06.390
<v Speaker 1>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try not to do it as much as possible,</v>

409
00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:07.740
<v Speaker 1>but there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

410
00:18:07.741 --> 00:18:10.170
<v Speaker 1>there's obviously exceptions like Ted </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bundy was out.</v>

411
00:18:10.171 --> 00:18:11.520
<v Speaker 1>I'd probably have to kill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>

412
00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:16.580
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the certain dudes like you can't </v>

413
00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:19.401
<v Speaker 1>get away with what you can't cut women's</v>
<v Speaker 1>pussies out and put them on your head </v>

414
00:18:19.401 --> 00:18:21.390
<v Speaker 1>and some things you can't shake on </v>
<v Speaker 1>photos and then you get out of jail.</v>

415
00:18:21.391 --> 00:18:23.340
<v Speaker 1>And then I'm gonna yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you did that in the past.</v>

416
00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:26.390
<v Speaker 1>We're going to judge you on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to hold you to that which is</v>

417
00:18:26.391 --> 00:18:27.490
<v Speaker 1>going to end it for you.</v>

418
00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:29.730
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

419
00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:35.020
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's people that you become enemies </v>

420
00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:37.341
<v Speaker 1>with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like getting a pattern of </v>

421
00:18:37.341 --> 00:18:38.740
<v Speaker 1>remaining their enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>

422
00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:42.240
<v Speaker 1>and that was never enemies with poly </v>
<v Speaker 1>entries had been been CEO.</v>

423
00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:47.400
<v Speaker 1>Never really enemies with poly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you get into this sort of a thing </v>

424
00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:49.020
<v Speaker 1>where it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is just what we do.</v>

425
00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:50.760
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't just let it go.</v>

426
00:18:50.761 --> 00:18:55.761
<v Speaker 1>Like I fucking hate that fucking guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What he tried to do to me and fucking </v>

427
00:18:55.761 --> 00:18:59.151
<v Speaker 1>this and that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he turned around when the shit </v>

428
00:18:59.151 --> 00:19:02.280
<v Speaker 1>goes on for like years and years where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you think the echoes of one conversation</v>

429
00:19:02.281 --> 00:19:06.510
<v Speaker 1>or the echoes of one interaction can </v>
<v Speaker 1>remain with you for your whole life just</v>

430
00:19:06.511 --> 00:19:08.640
<v Speaker 1>because you choose it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that person remains your enemy.</v>

431
00:19:08.641 --> 00:19:12.300
<v Speaker 1>You put so much vested interest in </v>
<v Speaker 1>energy into it's a complete waste.</v>

432
00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:17.750
<v Speaker 1>And if you can just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever you have like these little </v>

433
00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:19.230
<v Speaker 1>conflicts with people just as many times</v>
<v Speaker 1>as possible,</v>

434
00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:20.190
<v Speaker 1>resolve them.</v>

435
00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:25.370
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd be amazed at the psychic weight </v>

436
00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:25.860
<v Speaker 1>that's lifted off your soul when you do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

437
00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:30.980
<v Speaker 1>I think you're in a really negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>space every time you think about that.</v>

438
00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:32.610
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

439
00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:34.380
<v Speaker 1>totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

440
00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:36.130
<v Speaker 1>People that you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's.</v>

441
00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:40.260
<v Speaker 1>There's some conflict in life that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>unnecessarily necessary.</v>

442
00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:42.900
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's necessary,</v>

443
00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:47.730
<v Speaker 1>but it's unnecessary in the sense that </v>
<v Speaker 1>if we were all living in Utopia,</v>

444
00:19:47.731 --> 00:19:50.610
<v Speaker 1>if we all had our shit together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if everybody was cool and balanced,</v>

445
00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:55.670
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't be taking place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the vast majority of conflict </v>

446
00:19:55.670 --> 00:20:00.161
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't be taken place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you really think about how </v>

447
00:20:00.161 --> 00:20:03.351
<v Speaker 1>many people there are on earth and think</v>
<v Speaker 1>about how little actual conflict or is </v>

448
00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:08.990
<v Speaker 1>everybody was always wants to dwell on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the horrible aspects of our current </v>

449
00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:13.071
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They won't get Iraq and Afghanistan and </v>

450
00:20:13.071 --> 00:20:15.920
<v Speaker 1>murder and crime and a woman walked down</v>
<v Speaker 1>New York City Street for 10 hours and </v>

451
00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:17.640
<v Speaker 1>all she got was met at wanted to fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>

452
00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:20.130
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand that.</v>

453
00:20:20.131 --> 00:20:22.020
<v Speaker 1>That's an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do understand.</v>

454
00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:23.100
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have daughters.</v>

455
00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:26.490
<v Speaker 1>I have a mom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want anybody feeling harassed by</v>

456
00:20:26.491 --> 00:20:28.500
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of apes shares because some </v>
<v Speaker 1>dudes like,</v>

457
00:20:28.501 --> 00:20:29.020
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>

458
00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:30.660
<v Speaker 1>I got some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a picture on my wall.</v>

459
00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:32.520
<v Speaker 1>I think I've told,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talked about it before,</v>

460
00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:36.940
<v Speaker 1>but it's for like 1951.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an American woman in uh,</v>

461
00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:38.910
<v Speaker 1>in Italy and she's walking down the </v>
<v Speaker 1>street.</v>

462

<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a classic image of it's huge </v>

<v Speaker 1>And this is like,</v>

468
00:20:58.150 --> 00:21:01.060
<v Speaker 1>I used to think that people were like </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking father knows best back then.</v>

469
00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:01.900

<v Speaker 1>acted like that.</v>

472
00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:10.140
<v Speaker 1>But I read that that photo was somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 1>staged in that they did a couple takes </v>

473
00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:10.290
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

<v Speaker 1>picture.</v>

00:21:23.351 --> 00:21:24.550
<v Speaker 1>that up kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

480
00:21:24.551 --> 00:21:27.570
<v Speaker 1>even though they're actually really a </v>

<v Speaker 1>Italian.</v>

485
00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:42.990

<v Speaker 1>could shit on an Italian behavior.</v>

<v Speaker 1>which is one guy who stood next to her </v>

496
00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:12.160
<v Speaker 1>and kept walking with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy was a creep.</v>

499
00:22:18.331 --> 00:22:20.590
<v Speaker 1>think should have been highlighted in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that video that these guys are out there</v>

500
00:22:20.591 --> 00:22:21.910
<v Speaker 1>and that a girl could get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

501
00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:23.980
<v Speaker 1>your wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your girl,</v>

502
00:22:23.981 --> 00:22:28.210
<v Speaker 1>your mom stuck next to some asshole </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's creeping on her.</v>

<v Speaker 3>this has to be annoying.</v>

508
00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:43.600
<v Speaker 3>Because I was thinking if it was me just</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to walk down the street for me,</v>

509
00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:51.700

<v Speaker 3>stick their penis inside you and </v>

511
00:22:54.191 --> 00:22:54.920
<v Speaker 3>ejaculate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want any interaction with people</v>

512
00:22:54.921 --> 00:22:56.960
<v Speaker 3>that I don't know.</v>

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:22.470
<v Speaker 1>And here's something that someone told </v>
<v Speaker 1>me online them I read this.</v>

544
00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:27.890
<v Speaker 1>Someone was saying that they have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend who's a girl who's from South </v>

545
00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:29.580
<v Speaker 1>America and in South America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women like it.</v>

546
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:35.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we will be upset if they made cat calls </v>

<v Speaker 1>the illegal what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Girls like it when they walk down the </v>

548
00:24:37.591 --> 00:24:37.591
<v Speaker 1>street and guys talk,</v>

552
00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:47.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the issue is that they,</v>

553
00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:51.650
<v Speaker 1>it's a different culture and that our </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture is becoming hypersensitive,</v>

554
00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:54.900
<v Speaker 1>acutely aware of sexual assault and rape</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>

555
00:24:55.340 --> 00:25:00.340
<v Speaker 1>they connect every single act of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't even say aggression,</v>

556
00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:05.420
<v Speaker 1>but like enthusiastic courting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like on the street,</v>

557

00:25:55.610 --> 00:25:56.710
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>leave me alone.</v>

576
00:25:56.711 --> 00:25:58.510
<v Speaker 3>I'm just trying to walk for the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>part.</v>

577
00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:00.070
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most girls,</v>

578
00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:02.770
<v Speaker 3>the reality of being a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but don't women,</v>

579
00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:07.830
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>accept or love aggressiveness on some </v>

580
00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:10.651
<v Speaker 3>level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe like a subtle aggressive because </v>

581
00:26:10.651 --> 00:26:12.781
<v Speaker 3>they don't like to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not guys they liked though women,</v>

582
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:13.000
<v Speaker 3>I</v>

583
00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:18.690
<v Speaker 1>can appreciate a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>aggression from a person that they like </v>

584
00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:22.441
<v Speaker 1>and trust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a certain amount of aggression like </v>

585
00:26:22.441 --> 00:26:22.441
<v Speaker 1>that kind of an aggression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

586
00:26:22.441 --> 00:26:23.230
<v Speaker 1>The average person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously there's going to be with women</v>

587
00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:25.900
<v Speaker 1>and no one likes to say this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be women that have rape</v>

588
00:26:25.901 --> 00:26:29.260
<v Speaker 1>fantasies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's men who have rape fantasies.</v>

589
00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:32.200
<v Speaker 1>Men who have rape fantasies of them </v>
<v Speaker 1>being raped.</v>

590
00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:33.260
<v Speaker 1>There's everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's.</v>

591
00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:36.660
<v Speaker 1>Everybody has their own kink share now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there are some people that have like,</v>

592
00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:39.730
<v Speaker 1>maybe they have fantasies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like have you ever see that?</v>

593
00:26:39.731 --> 00:26:41.980
<v Speaker 1>Louis ck jokes got a great joke about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

594
00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:44.010
<v Speaker 1>about how we made out with this girl</v>

595
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:49.010
<v Speaker 2>and tried to push it and she said no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he stopped and then the next day </v>

596
00:26:49.010 --> 00:26:49.410
<v Speaker 2>she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happened last night?</v>

597
00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:51.090
<v Speaker 2>And he said what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she goes,</v>

598
00:26:51.091 --> 00:26:52.290
<v Speaker 2>I thought you were just going to go for </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

599
00:26:52.291 --> 00:26:54.500
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck are you talking about?</v>

600
00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:59.660
<v Speaker 2>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was hoping you were just going to go </v>

601
00:26:59.660 --> 00:26:59.660
<v Speaker 2>for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

602
00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:02.080
<v Speaker 2>what do you think I'm going to take a </v>
<v Speaker 2>chance on the off chance that you're </v>

603
00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:02.180
<v Speaker 2>into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be really into rape.</v>

604
00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:04.950
<v Speaker 2>It's a really funny bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like there are.</v>

605
00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:07.090
<v Speaker 2>Those people do exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

606
00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:12.200
<v Speaker 2>But that said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the majority of women don't want to be </v>

607
00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:12.270
<v Speaker 2>cat called when they walked on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>street.</v>

608
00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:17.420
<v Speaker 2>But this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a difference between like some </v>

609
00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:20.571
<v Speaker 2>of what we saw on that video and some of</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're just going to get when you </v>

610
00:27:20.571 --> 00:27:20.571
<v Speaker 2>pass by a group of men.</v>

611
00:27:20.571 --> 00:27:25.330
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know there's going to be a group of </v>

612
00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:25.330
<v Speaker 2>men that go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God damn,</v>

613
00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:26.880
<v Speaker 2>even if they don't look at you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're hot and you walked by men,</v>

614
00:27:26.881 --> 00:27:29.850
<v Speaker 2>they'll go cheat us is what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that.</v>

615
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.830
<v Speaker 2>Is that cat calling?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that bad?</v>

616
00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:36.920
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you're wearing a fucking tiny </v>

617
00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:39.561
<v Speaker 2>miniskirt that's just clinging to your </v>
<v Speaker 2>ass and you have high heels on and you </v>

618
00:27:39.561 --> 00:27:43.521
<v Speaker 2>smelled like the nectar of the Gods and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're walking past a group of men and </v>

619
00:27:44.071 --> 00:27:45.670
<v Speaker 2>there's more than two guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

620
00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:47.550
<v Speaker 2>we're going to curse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One guy is probably gonna.</v>

621
00:27:47.551 --> 00:27:48.670
<v Speaker 2>Keep talking about shut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

622
00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:53.680
<v Speaker 2>There's something that happens when we </v>
<v Speaker 2>get in packs of apes where it's almost </v>

623
00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:56.090
<v Speaker 2>like if you get over it exponentially </v>
<v Speaker 2>gets more likely that someone's going to</v>

624
00:27:56.091 --> 00:28:01.091
<v Speaker 2>say something or three almost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of it is men trying to make </v>

625
00:28:01.091 --> 00:28:01.091
<v Speaker 2>each other laugh.</v>

626
00:28:01.091 --> 00:28:05.930
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of it is not even like trying to </v>

627
00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:08.631
<v Speaker 2>pick up the girl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's certainly not being considered the </v>

628
00:28:08.631 --> 00:28:08.631
<v Speaker 2>girl's feelings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of is like,</v>

629
00:28:08.631 --> 00:28:09.180
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I would do to that,</v>

630
00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:12.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people fall down laughing or we make</v>

631
00:28:12.751 --> 00:28:14.950
<v Speaker 2>each other laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a victim in that column.</v>

632
00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:18.150
<v Speaker 2>We're to feel like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just curse quietly to myself.</v>

633
00:28:18.151 --> 00:28:23.151
<v Speaker 2>I can't help.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just gonna come kind of like that.</v>

634
00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:29.910
<v Speaker 2>That's quieter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

635
00:28:30.050 --> 00:28:32.370
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just go Jesus Christ,</v>

636
00:28:32.371 --> 00:28:34.110
<v Speaker 2>but it's in A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it's positive,</v>

637
00:28:34.111 --> 00:28:36.750
<v Speaker 2>but I keep it to myself because I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>like to make people feel uncomfortable.</v>

638
00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:38.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Problem is,</v>

639
00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:41.010
<v Speaker 2>isn't like there's five or six guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>

640
00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:43.050
<v Speaker 2>That's when it gets uncomfortable and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what you saw.</v>

641
00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:45.090
<v Speaker 2>Like even like two or three when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>saw,</v>

642
00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:50.120
<v Speaker 2>when you saw like a lot of what she's </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting catcalled it was dudes like </v>

643
00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:52.140
<v Speaker 2>almost making each other laugh as they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were doing it as like passing the comedy</v>

644
00:28:52.141 --> 00:28:53.160
<v Speaker 2>store on sunset.</v>

645
00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:53.600
<v Speaker 2>If you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

646
00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:55.470
<v Speaker 2>all the comics are sitting there on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>patio.</v>

647
00:28:55.471 --> 00:28:57.840
<v Speaker 2>Anytime a girl walks by like a mini </v>
<v Speaker 2>dress.</v>

648
00:28:57.841 --> 00:29:02.841
<v Speaker 2>It's just kind of what did you just do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to do social justice </v>

649
00:29:02.841 --> 00:29:06.291
<v Speaker 2>warriors going to be out on sunset,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to strap a camera to the most </v>

650
00:29:06.291 --> 00:29:07.980
<v Speaker 2>attractive woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They could find the best.</v>

651
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.350
<v Speaker 2>The best looking one is passed back and </v>
<v Speaker 2>forth.</v>

652
00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:15.420
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a game show or that show right </v>

653
00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:15.420
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just go back and forth at the comedy.</v>

654
00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:20.320
<v Speaker 2>We should make a show called I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>offended and just get offended at </v>

655
00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:23.220
<v Speaker 2>virtually everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see the fucking latest thing.</v>

656
00:29:23.221 --> 00:29:24.540
<v Speaker 2>I tweeted this today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is.</v>

657
00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:26.670
<v Speaker 2>This is not bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is actually real.</v>

658
00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:31.850
<v Speaker 2>There is a Portland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oregon teacher that is against peanut </v>

659
00:29:32.161 --> 00:29:36.300
<v Speaker 2>butter and jelly sandwiches because she </v>
<v Speaker 2>says they're inherently racist.</v>

660
00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:40.400
<v Speaker 2>That's peanut butter and jelly getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>along post.</v>

661
00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:42.910
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Peanut butter and Jelly Racist</v>

662
00:29:43.090 --> 00:29:47.170
<v Speaker 1>Portland school principal tie sandwich </v>
<v Speaker 1>to white privilege.</v>

663
00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:50.790
<v Speaker 1>This is where we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ladies and gentlemen in 2000 and fucking</v>

664
00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:53.650
<v Speaker 1>14.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're saying black people can't afford</v>

665
00:29:53.651 --> 00:29:54.330
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man,</v>

666
00:29:54.550 --> 00:29:55.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't even.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

667
00:29:55.540 --> 00:30:00.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why my trash isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peanut butter and Jelly.</v>

668
00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:02.230
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Super White.</v>

669
00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:07.180
<v Speaker 1>What about Somali or Hispanic students </v>
<v Speaker 1>who might not eat sandwiches?</v>

670
00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:09.640
<v Speaker 1>You?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tara says according to the Tribune.</v>

671
00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:13.750
<v Speaker 1>Another way would be to say Americans </v>
<v Speaker 1>eat peanut butter and jelly.</v>

672
00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:16.270
<v Speaker 1>Do you have anything like that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me tell you.</v>

673
00:30:16.450 --> 00:30:19.900
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they eat torta or Peta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ugh,</v>

674
00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:24.960
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is going on in this </v>

675
00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:25.720
<v Speaker 1>country?</v>
<v Speaker 1>For Real?</v>

676
00:30:25.721 --> 00:30:27.550
<v Speaker 1>It's just a god peanut butter and Jelly </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sandwich.</v>

677
00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:30.200
<v Speaker 1>There's not even any meat in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't even get Vegan pissed.</v>

678
00:30:30.270 --> 00:30:32.080
<v Speaker 1>I really think that what's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

679
00:30:32.081 --> 00:30:37.081
<v Speaker 1>this is going to sound completely crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I really think that what's going on </v>

680
00:30:37.081 --> 00:30:40.410
<v Speaker 1>when we're becoming more and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypersensitive and more and more aware </v>

681
00:30:40.410 --> 00:30:44.521
<v Speaker 1>of like these little things that don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean a goddamn thing and focusing on </v>

682
00:30:44.521 --> 00:30:47.791
<v Speaker 1>them and spending all this energy while </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have this finite amount of time in </v>

683
00:30:47.791 --> 00:30:47.791
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

684
00:30:47.791 --> 00:30:48.880
<v Speaker 1>I think people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially as we get older,</v>

685
00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:52.780
<v Speaker 1>our fucking terrified of death were </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrified of death,</v>

686
00:30:52.810 --> 00:30:53.920
<v Speaker 1>of death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the planet,</v>

687
00:30:53.921 --> 00:30:55.090
<v Speaker 1>of death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of our children,</v>

688
00:30:55.091 --> 00:30:56.800
<v Speaker 1>death of our friend's death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of our loved ones,</v>

689
00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:59.080
<v Speaker 1>and as it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as things move on,</v>

690
00:30:59.081 --> 00:31:04.081
<v Speaker 1>we concentrate more and more a </v>
<v Speaker 1>nonsensical minutia more and more on </v>

691
00:31:04.081 --> 00:31:06.690
<v Speaker 1>Pulse Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more stupidity and it just,</v>

692
00:31:06.910 --> 00:31:11.910
<v Speaker 1>it gets more and more ridiculous and </v>
<v Speaker 1>even intelligent people if that's the </v>

693
00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:13.060
<v Speaker 1>creepiest thing about these social </v>
<v Speaker 1>justice warrior folks that are just.</v>

694
00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:15.490
<v Speaker 1>Some of them are just completely out to </v>
<v Speaker 1>lunch on some shit,</v>

695
00:31:15.850 --> 00:31:19.060
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things about them is </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're almost all well read,</v>

696
00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:24.120
<v Speaker 1>almost all articulate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost all intelligent be at the </v>

697
00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:25.360
<v Speaker 1>beginning completely roped up and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>nonsense like wha,</v>

698
00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:29.320
<v Speaker 1>what do they call outs and the doxing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're just spending all their time</v>

699
00:31:29.321 --> 00:31:33.510
<v Speaker 1>online going after perceived slights and</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of it is legit.</v>

700
00:31:33.511 --> 00:31:35.010
<v Speaker 1>Like this bill cosby Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

701
00:31:35.170 --> 00:31:37.450
<v Speaker 1>That's legit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some of it is like peanut butter and</v>

702
00:31:37.451 --> 00:31:39.460
<v Speaker 1>Jelly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking sandwiches are racist.</v>

703
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.350
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

704
00:31:41.351 --> 00:31:42.520
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing?</v>

705
00:31:42.521 --> 00:31:44.770
<v Speaker 1>You're an adult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Couldn't be any less important.</v>

706
00:31:45.210 --> 00:31:48.720
<v Speaker 1>You're not even an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're making up an issue now.</v>

707
00:31:48.730 --> 00:31:49.380
<v Speaker 1>I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

708
00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:54.440
<v Speaker 1>you're definitely avoiding your more </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated thoughts when you start </v>

709
00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:58.620
<v Speaker 1>bringing trivia into your fucking brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Complete total trivia and I also think </v>

710
00:31:58.620 --> 00:31:58.620
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

711
00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:03.820
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just super bad for your </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>

712
00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:06.640
<v Speaker 1>It's super bad for your brain to </v>
<v Speaker 1>concentrate too much on.</v>

713
00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:11.720
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if especially if it's making </v>

714
00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:11.720
<v Speaker 1>you angry because then you're just </v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting in a chair anger,</v>

715
00:32:11.770 --> 00:32:16.770
<v Speaker 1>angry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's like you need to use that </v>

716
00:32:16.770 --> 00:32:16.770
<v Speaker 1>energy in other ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

717
00:32:16.770 --> 00:32:21.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just that basic primal like ready </v>

718
00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:22.120
<v Speaker 1>to fight feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're just sitting in a chair.</v>

719
00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:25.090
<v Speaker 1>You don't put that energy anywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's bad for your body to.</v>

720
00:32:25.270 --> 00:32:27.790
<v Speaker 1>I've been paying attention to a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people's twitters lately,</v>

721
00:32:27.910 --> 00:32:30.040
<v Speaker 1>like watching people that get into </v>
<v Speaker 1>consistent twitter,</v>

722
00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:32.450
<v Speaker 1>twitter wars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you just look at them.</v>

723
00:32:32.451 --> 00:32:35.740
<v Speaker 1>You're like this person sleeping four </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours a night madness.</v>

724
00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:38.290
<v Speaker 1>It's the whole lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're fighting with strangers too.</v>

725
00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:43.320
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people that are like </v>
<v Speaker 1>living in front of the computer saying </v>

726
00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:47.471
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>waiting for someone to respond and then </v>

727
00:32:47.471 --> 00:32:47.471
<v Speaker 1>saying something back.</v>

728
00:32:47.471 --> 00:32:47.620
<v Speaker 1>Like sometimes it's a tweet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something mean to me,</v>

729
00:32:47.621 --> 00:32:51.100
<v Speaker 1>I'll just go to their site and see what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they do and it's like all mean tweets to</v>

730
00:32:51.130 --> 00:32:56.130
<v Speaker 1>to other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to everybody responds and they always </v>

731
00:32:56.130 --> 00:32:57.350
<v Speaker 1>have about 13 followers and you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>gotTa let it go.</v>

732
00:32:57.410 --> 00:32:59.990
<v Speaker 1>Even if you have a good comeback,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to let it go.</v>

733
00:32:59.991 --> 00:33:01.970
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise you're in a twitter fight in </v>
<v Speaker 1>public.</v>

734
00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't care if they have hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of followers.</v>

735
00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:05.860
<v Speaker 1>It's still the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you.</v>

736
00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:07.380
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

737
00:33:07.381 --> 00:33:12.381
<v Speaker 1>like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one thing if there's something </v>

738
00:33:12.381 --> 00:33:12.381
<v Speaker 1>legitimate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's something legitimate,</v>

739
00:33:12.381 --> 00:33:16.720
<v Speaker 1>vast majority of these discussions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you paid any attention to Gamer </v>

740
00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:16.720
<v Speaker 1>Gate?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what Gamergate is?</v>

741
00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:18.800
<v Speaker 1>What's said about fucking completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>baffled.</v>

742
00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:24.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I backed out like I did when those </v>

743
00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:24.070
<v Speaker 1>things were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I walked in and he's like,</v>

744
00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:24.070
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

745
00:33:24.670 --> 00:33:26.840
<v Speaker 1>well I definitely care,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's,</v>

746
00:33:26.841 --> 00:33:28.070
<v Speaker 1>it's so confusing.</v>

747
00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:31.940
<v Speaker 1>There's so many sides to it for this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea behind it.</v>

748
00:33:31.941 --> 00:33:34.610
<v Speaker 1>The idea is ethics in journalism on one </v>
<v Speaker 1>side,</v>

749
00:33:34.611 --> 00:33:39.611
<v Speaker 1>that's what they're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ethics in game journalism and the other </v>

750
00:33:39.611 --> 00:33:41.210
<v Speaker 1>side is saying it's really about </v>
<v Speaker 1>harassing women and that this,</v>

751
00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:44.180
<v Speaker 1>this woman who they initially went </v>
<v Speaker 1>after,</v>

752
00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:45.160
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

753
00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:45.770
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

754
00:33:45.771 --> 00:33:49.820
<v Speaker 1>who gives a shit and what's the big deal</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she's just a game designer.</v>

755
00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:53.690
<v Speaker 1>Apparently she slept with some guy's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm butchering this story.</v>

756
00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:56.210
<v Speaker 1>I've heard a little bit about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the worst part of it,</v>

757
00:33:56.211 --> 00:34:01.211
<v Speaker 1>the absolute worst part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but was all the death threats and all </v>

758
00:34:01.211 --> 00:34:04.391
<v Speaker 1>the negative people speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is feminist chick and Anna,</v>

759
00:34:05.841 --> 00:34:10.841
<v Speaker 1>I think analysts are keys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything thunder foot as a bunch of </v>

760
00:34:10.841 --> 00:34:11.960
<v Speaker 1>hilarious videos on her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but whatever's her,</v>

761
00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:16.550
<v Speaker 1>her idea is that she's trying to promote</v>
<v Speaker 1>gender,</v>

762
00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:20.720
<v Speaker 1>not just um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say like equality and gains,</v>

763
00:34:20.721 --> 00:34:25.100
<v Speaker 1>but she just wants to discourage </v>
<v Speaker 1>stereotypes and she wants cheese showing</v>

764
00:34:25.101 --> 00:34:30.101
<v Speaker 1>that there's some aspects of video games</v>
<v Speaker 1>that show women as objects like,</v>

765
00:34:30.111 --> 00:34:35.111
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the fucking what is the vice grand </v>

766
00:34:35.111 --> 00:34:35.360
<v Speaker 1>theft auto,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grand theft auto game.</v>

767
00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:39.250
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of bad shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

768
00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:42.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't think she's necessarily saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>censor it.</v>

769
00:34:42.410 --> 00:34:44.150
<v Speaker 1>I think she wants people to be aware of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

770
00:34:44.151 --> 00:34:44.810
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

771
00:34:44.811 --> 00:34:47.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to be super open minded on </v>
<v Speaker 1>all this stuff,</v>

772
00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:52.280
<v Speaker 1>but the worst aspects of it for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the death threats,</v>

773
00:34:52.430 --> 00:34:54.680
<v Speaker 1>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is where it gets really crazy.</v>

774
00:34:54.681 --> 00:34:57.770
<v Speaker 1>Some people believe this is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy theory.</v>

775
00:34:57.771 --> 00:35:02.771
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people believe that some of these </v>

776
00:35:02.771 --> 00:35:04.040
<v Speaker 1>in fact death threats or some of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>threats aren't real.</v>

777
00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:09.460
<v Speaker 1>That what they're doing is trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>discredit the gamergate movement by </v>

778
00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:12.971
<v Speaker 1>making it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That there are all these massages and </v>

779
00:35:12.971 --> 00:35:15.131
<v Speaker 1>creeps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then these other people that are </v>

780
00:35:15.131 --> 00:35:15.680
<v Speaker 1>involved in Gamergate started this thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>calling not your Hashtag,</v>

781
00:35:15.681 --> 00:35:18.890
<v Speaker 1>not your shield and it's all people of </v>
<v Speaker 1>color or women.</v>

782
00:35:18.891 --> 00:35:23.891
<v Speaker 1>All these people who support ethics in </v>
<v Speaker 1>game journalism who think this whole </v>

783
00:35:23.891 --> 00:35:26.810
<v Speaker 1>issue is getting sort of misconstrued </v>
<v Speaker 1>and distorted and twisted,</v>

784
00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:27.800
<v Speaker 1>but it's so.</v>

785
00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:32.860
<v Speaker 1>It's so convoluted and multi-sided.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think both sides have some sort of a </v>

786
00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:37.331
<v Speaker 1>point for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't want an involved like deeply</v>

787
00:35:37.921 --> 00:35:40.920
<v Speaker 1>in video games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think what they're trying to do is</v>

788
00:35:40.921 --> 00:35:45.921
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to discourage this </v>
<v Speaker 1>extreme left from taking over from </v>

789
00:35:46.861 --> 00:35:51.861
<v Speaker 1>controlling the narrative from like </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying that all video gamers are </v>

790
00:35:51.861 --> 00:35:55.700
<v Speaker 1>misogynists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All video gamers are assholes and I </v>

791
00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:56.790
<v Speaker 1>think for a lot of these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're super socially awkward.</v>

792
00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:58.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of video gamers,</v>

793
00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:00.360
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

794
00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:03.810
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're online all the time,</v>

795
00:36:03.811 --> 00:36:05.310
<v Speaker 1>like it's a big percentage of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>social life.</v>

796
00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:10.640
<v Speaker 1>I know this because I used to be in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking quake clan and I used to hang </v>

797
00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:14.001
<v Speaker 1>out with these dudes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we used to get together and have </v>

798
00:36:14.001 --> 00:36:15.711
<v Speaker 1>land parties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had dudes come over my house man when </v>

799
00:36:15.711 --> 00:36:15.711
<v Speaker 1>I was on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

800
00:36:15.711 --> 00:36:16.020
<v Speaker 1>I met dudes online.</v>

801
00:36:16.070 --> 00:36:21.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all came over to my house and we </v>

802
00:36:21.070 --> 00:36:21.070
<v Speaker 1>had a fucking land party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

803
00:36:21.070 --> 00:36:22.590
<v Speaker 1>I was a super dork.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to make my own computers.</v>

804
00:36:22.591 --> 00:36:25.350
<v Speaker 1>I would go down to fry's electronics and</v>
<v Speaker 1>buy a motherboard and a case.</v>

805
00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:26.880
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Put the ad.</v>

<v Speaker 1>the whole deal.</v>

807
00:36:28.290 --> 00:36:31.020
<v Speaker 1>My friend Andrew would talk me through </v>
<v Speaker 1>it when shit would go bad,</v>

808
00:36:31.021 --> 00:36:33.450
<v Speaker 1>but for the most part I kind of figured </v>
<v Speaker 1>it out.</v>

809
00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:35.430
<v Speaker 1>Andrew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who developed my website?</v>

00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:37.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>menthol.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking jumpers.</v>

812
00:36:38.970 --> 00:36:43.970
<v Speaker 1>Jumpers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like one little jumper could make the </v>

813
00:36:43.970 --> 00:36:43.970
<v Speaker 1>whole computer work or not work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a Christmas light.</v>

814
00:36:43.970 --> 00:36:47.700
<v Speaker 1>And this was guys that were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were like overclocking.</v>

815
00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:49.500
<v Speaker 1>They went over clock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would get these,</v>

816
00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:50.730
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

817
00:36:51.090 --> 00:36:53.690
<v Speaker 1>these cpas that weren't as strong like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the seller.</v>

818
00:36:53.691 --> 00:36:55.440
<v Speaker 1>Ron's memory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those celeron processors.</v>

819
00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:59.760
<v Speaker 1>You can get a 300 Celeron and you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>jack that sucker up to like four,</v>

820
00:36:59.761 --> 00:37:04.761
<v Speaker 1>25 and guys would put like extra fans </v>
<v Speaker 1>and shit and he'd blow cold air on it.</v>

821
00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:06.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were just trying to like.</v>

822
00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:09.950
<v Speaker 1>And so I was involved in this culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this is not,</v>

823
00:37:10.110 --> 00:37:12.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm not talking out of my ass when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about these guys.</v>

824
00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:15.330
<v Speaker 1>And for a lot of these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

825
00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:18.240
<v Speaker 1>they're very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're very sexually inexperienced.</v>

826
00:37:18.241 --> 00:37:19.530
<v Speaker 1>Some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

827
00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:22.050
<v Speaker 1>some of them are there shut-ins a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>

828
00:37:22.051 --> 00:37:24.360
<v Speaker 1>They don't go out and they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't meet a lot in.</v>

829
00:37:24.361 --> 00:37:27.330
<v Speaker 1>So like this idea that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

830
00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:29.910
<v Speaker 1>objectifying women in these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in these video games,</v>

831
00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:35.510
<v Speaker 1>I see your point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you look at the people that are </v>

832
00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:36.420
<v Speaker 1>watching these things and playing these </v>
<v Speaker 1>games,</v>

833
00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:39.240
<v Speaker 1>if you really want to think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

834
00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:45.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you can make a real </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument that it's affecting their </v>

835
00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:45.500
<v Speaker 1>behavior and making them go out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>assault and rape and others.</v>

836
00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:50.540
<v Speaker 1>They're very shy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People that aren't aggressive in the </v>

837
00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:50.540
<v Speaker 1>least.</v>

838
00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:51.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean that's a huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's a huge generalization.</v>

839
00:37:51.631 --> 00:37:56.631
<v Speaker 1>Obviously I've made a generalization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that it becomes an issue of </v>

840
00:37:57.870 --> 00:38:02.870
<v Speaker 1>you can be a really good person who </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have any malice towards any sex,</v>

841
00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:05.540
<v Speaker 1>any gender,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any orientation.</v>

842
00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:08.460
<v Speaker 1>A huge could be just non-racist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>normal,</v>

843
00:38:08.461 --> 00:38:12.690
<v Speaker 1>cool person and enjoy playing some </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking crazy game.</v>

844
00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:13.990
<v Speaker 1>We will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you a,</v>

845
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.880
<v Speaker 1>you can smack a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

846
00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:20.900
<v Speaker 1>there's a game when you're in a fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're shooting guns at people and </v>

847
00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:20.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every now and then a girl comes out,</v>

848
00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:24.360
<v Speaker 1>you screaming at a time the pimp slap </v>
<v Speaker 1>swatter,</v>

849
00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:25.710
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you get a 10,</v>

850
00:38:25.770 --> 00:38:30.770
<v Speaker 1>like 10 shows up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you can really catch her perfect </v>

851
00:38:30.770 --> 00:38:30.770
<v Speaker 1>with the pimp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Slap this.</v>

852
00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:32.230
<v Speaker 1>Not a real person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

853
00:38:32.290 --> 00:38:37.290
<v Speaker 1>It's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be terrible to actually slap a </v>

854
00:38:37.290 --> 00:38:37.290
<v Speaker 1>woman in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be terrible.</v>

855
00:38:37.290 --> 00:38:41.130
<v Speaker 1>One of the worst things you could do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I really think that you can do that </v>

856
00:38:41.130 --> 00:38:45.811
<v Speaker 1>game where you can slap a cartoon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women in the face and you're not a bad </v>

857
00:38:45.811 --> 00:38:46.020
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

858
00:38:46.021 --> 00:38:47.200
<v Speaker 1>could it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's fantasy.</v>

859
00:38:47.201 --> 00:38:52.201
<v Speaker 1>It's just like when you watch a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like think of any number of movies that </v>

860
00:38:52.201 --> 00:38:56.971
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have horrible scenes where women get </v>

861
00:38:56.971 --> 00:38:56.971
<v Speaker 1>beat up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or how about that fucking.</v>

862
00:38:56.971 --> 00:39:00.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm the Quentin Tarantino movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>True Romance.</v>

863
00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:03.070
<v Speaker 1>Perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was um,</v>

864
00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:08.280
<v Speaker 1>James James Gandolfini and applegate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our cat,</v>

865
00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:10.660
<v Speaker 1>our cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Patricia Arquette,</v>

866
00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:11.260
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

867
00:39:11.410 --> 00:39:13.750
<v Speaker 1>Fuck too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's tough to watch.</v>

868
00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:15.130
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's tough to watch.</v>

869
00:39:15.131 --> 00:39:17.220
<v Speaker 1>He beats the shit out of her and she </v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually kills them.</v>

870
00:39:17.290 --> 00:39:22.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean he's beating the shit out of </v>

871
00:39:22.290 --> 00:39:22.290
<v Speaker 1>it and you're watching it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

872
00:39:22.290 --> 00:39:23.800
<v Speaker 1>You're watching this fucking movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you controlling it?</v>

873
00:39:23.830 --> 00:39:28.830
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're watching a movie that's </v>

874
00:39:28.830 --> 00:39:31.000
<v Speaker 1>depicting a horrific scene that could </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly happen now.</v>

875
00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:36.000
<v Speaker 1>I guess you could say that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>different if you're playing a game </v>

876
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.270
<v Speaker 1>because then you're an objector.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have an objective,</v>

877
00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:38.980
<v Speaker 1>you know you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're accomplishing something,</v>

878
00:39:38.981 --> 00:39:42.040
<v Speaker 1>and if this is a part of your objective </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you get to slap girls.</v>

879
00:39:42.370 --> 00:39:44.080
<v Speaker 1>I could see how that could be kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked up,</v>

880
00:39:44.081 --> 00:39:46.570
<v Speaker 1>but all of it is fantasy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

881
00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:51.820
<v Speaker 1>And if you're a good person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the real issue is how much to </v>

882
00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:55.300
<v Speaker 1>games or any media for that matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much they actually affect the way we</v>

883
00:39:55.301 --> 00:40:00.301
<v Speaker 1>behave and how much of it is how our </v>
<v Speaker 1>parents raised us and the environment </v>

884
00:40:00.301 --> 00:40:03.931
<v Speaker 1>that we lived in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The actual real human friendships that </v>

885
00:40:03.931 --> 00:40:03.931
<v Speaker 1>we had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much of is that?</v>

886
00:40:03.931 --> 00:40:08.880
<v Speaker 1>All I know is I've smacked the girl in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the video game but never in real life </v>

887
00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:10.270
<v Speaker 1>and I and I don't intend to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that real life,</v>

888
00:40:10.330 --> 00:40:15.330
<v Speaker 1>unless it girl smacked you really </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking hard and really got your Irish </v>

889
00:40:15.330 --> 00:40:15.330
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

890
00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:18.950
<v Speaker 1>My Irish ego driven this flash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hm.</v>

891
00:40:19.730 --> 00:40:20.680
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

892
00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:25.710
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the argument when that dude </v>

893
00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:25.710
<v Speaker 1>knocked the girl out in the elevator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was his name?</v>

894
00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:29.080
<v Speaker 1>The football player,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shawn Ray Rice Ray Rice,</v>

895
00:40:29.350 --> 00:40:34.350
<v Speaker 1>who uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his girlfriend cracked him or his </v>

896
00:40:34.350 --> 00:40:34.350
<v Speaker 1>fiance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever she is.</v>

897
00:40:34.350 --> 00:40:35.620
<v Speaker 1>And then he left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hooked her and knocked her unconscious.</v>

898
00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:36.640
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

899
00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:38.500
<v Speaker 1>It's fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But is he right handed?</v>

900
00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:43.060
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter because it was a short</v>
<v Speaker 1>left hook because very good punch punch.</v>

901
00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:46.840
<v Speaker 1>But the point being like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

902
00:40:46.841 --> 00:40:50.470
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's way fucked up to knock someone out.</v>

903
00:40:50.471 --> 00:40:52.600
<v Speaker 1>That's your wife or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody like that.</v>

904
00:40:52.601 --> 00:40:57.601
<v Speaker 1>Especially a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you couldn't control her in some </v>

905
00:40:57.601 --> 00:40:57.601
<v Speaker 1>other way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

906
00:40:57.601 --> 00:40:58.630
<v Speaker 1>she shouldn't have had him either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

907
00:40:58.690 --> 00:41:03.690
<v Speaker 1>She shouldn't have hit him and no one's </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying she shouldn't have hit him </v>

908
00:41:03.690 --> 00:41:03.690
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

909
00:41:03.690 --> 00:41:03.850
<v Speaker 1>you crazy bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why'd you hit ray rice?</v>

910
00:41:03.970 --> 00:41:06.940
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like because of what he did </v>
<v Speaker 1>to her in response to what she did,</v>

911
00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:08.950
<v Speaker 1>she doesn't get blamed for what she did.</v>

912
00:41:08.970 --> 00:41:13.970
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if there was a video where she just </v>

913
00:41:13.970 --> 00:41:14.680
<v Speaker 1>punched him in the face in an elevator </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they left,</v>

914
00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:19.860
<v Speaker 1>do you think there would be this giant </v>
<v Speaker 1>outrage where everybody was like ray </v>

915
00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:22.510
<v Speaker 1>rice got assaulted by his wife?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That woman is a terrible person.</v>

916
00:41:22.511 --> 00:41:25.240
<v Speaker 1>She needs to be in jail with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it based?</v>

917
00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:30.070
<v Speaker 1>Is it the action I've seen this is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>action or is it based on how much damage</v>

918
00:41:30.310 --> 00:41:33.680
<v Speaker 1>you actually do with what you've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what your action is?</v>

919
00:41:33.770 --> 00:41:38.770
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if this woman is hitting this guy </v>

920
00:41:38.770 --> 00:41:39.380
<v Speaker 1>and then he smacks her in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

921
00:41:39.450 --> 00:41:40.880
<v Speaker 1>take this off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to watch a shit.</v>

922
00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:43.160
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

923
00:41:43.161 --> 00:41:44.000
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but look,</v>

924
00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:49.150
<v Speaker 1>both people did the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just one person was better at it </v>

925
00:41:49.150 --> 00:41:49.810
<v Speaker 1>and one person actually started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

926
00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:50.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

927
00:41:50.301 --> 00:41:53.420
<v Speaker 1>it's more fucked up because he's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful man.</v>

928
00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:58.420
<v Speaker 1>He's a professional athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He obviously knocked completely </v>

929
00:41:58.420 --> 00:41:58.420
<v Speaker 1>unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

930
00:41:58.420 --> 00:42:00.580
<v Speaker 1>a whole lot of brain trauma there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She could have died all the about me.</v>

931
00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:05.540
<v Speaker 1>She fucking clanged her head off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That bar handlebars was playing.</v>

932
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:07.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was out.</v>

933
00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:09.460
<v Speaker 1>Do was one of the worst knockouts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it.</v>

934
00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:10.990
<v Speaker 1>I've seen a lot of people get knocked </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

935
00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:16.020
<v Speaker 1>That was a bad doc out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no one is saying she's a bad person </v>

936
00:42:16.020 --> 00:42:16.780
<v Speaker 1>for hitting him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

937
00:42:16.850 --> 00:42:18.680
<v Speaker 1>I haven't heard it once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

938
00:42:18.681 --> 00:42:20.210
<v Speaker 1>but it's not cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

939
00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:21.830
<v Speaker 1>that's what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's supposed to hit anybody.</v>

940
00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:22.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

941
00:42:22.521 --> 00:42:26.330
<v Speaker 1>And you definitely shouldn't hit a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking super athlete and a small space.</v>

942
00:42:26.331 --> 00:42:27.800
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

943
00:42:27.801 --> 00:42:29.150
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

944
00:42:29.151 --> 00:42:32.510
<v Speaker 1>It's not good that he hit her for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you're also dealing with dudes.</v>

945
00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:37.840
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked to Michael Irvin about this </v>

946
00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:39.341
<v Speaker 1>once and Michael Irvin works with a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of young kids that are coming up that </v>

947
00:42:39.550 --> 00:42:40.190
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

948
00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:45.200
<v Speaker 1>have been in impoverished situations </v>
<v Speaker 1>growing up and they've had a lot of </v>

949
00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:49.091
<v Speaker 1>violence in the family and he was saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>that your body just gets when you're </v>

950
00:42:49.131 --> 00:42:50.630
<v Speaker 1>young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when you're going through the</v>

951
00:42:50.631 --> 00:42:55.631
<v Speaker 1>womb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when your mother is going through a </v>

952
00:42:55.631 --> 00:42:57.100
<v Speaker 1>tremendous amount of stress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body gets almost designed to react </v>

953
00:42:57.100 --> 00:43:00.941
<v Speaker 1>instantaneously and make poor choices </v>
<v Speaker 1>like your body almost as response just </v>

954
00:43:00.941 --> 00:43:05.560
<v Speaker 1>so shellshocked that your body's </v>
<v Speaker 1>designed to like it's set up to deal </v>

955
00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:07.790
<v Speaker 1>with the trauma of a bad neighborhood </v>
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>

956
00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:09.380
<v Speaker 1>And it's based on when you're still in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the womb.</v>

957
00:43:09.590 --> 00:43:12.010
<v Speaker 1>So based on the stress that your mother </v>
<v Speaker 1>experienced as well,</v>

958
00:43:12.011 --> 00:43:14.450
<v Speaker 1>she's got you in her womb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ,</v>

959
00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:17.180
<v Speaker 1>crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you make worse decisions based on</v>

960
00:43:17.181 --> 00:43:17.970
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

961
00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:20.150
<v Speaker 1>you follow your instincts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>follow your instincts.</v>

962
00:43:20.151 --> 00:43:23.210
<v Speaker 1>You become more aggressive and violent </v>
<v Speaker 1>and more aggressive and violent.</v>

963
00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:26.600
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times leads to poor thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poor,</v>

964
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:28.910
<v Speaker 1>poor planning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

965
00:43:28.911 --> 00:43:33.911
<v Speaker 1>he was saying that this is what a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>these guys are dealing with a lot of </v>

966
00:43:33.911 --> 00:43:34.310
<v Speaker 1>these nfl players,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of young athletes,</v>

967
00:43:34.311 --> 00:43:39.311
<v Speaker 1>it's like they were literally program </v>
<v Speaker 1>different than people that grew up in a </v>

968
00:43:39.311 --> 00:43:41.870
<v Speaker 1>nice house with a nice family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nice environment.</v>

969
00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:44.960
<v Speaker 1>Like they're literally hardwired in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>different way because your brain thinks,</v>

970
00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:46.670
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well this is the game we're playing.</v>

971
00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:52.060
<v Speaker 1>We're not playing pokemon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to go ahead and we're going </v>

972
00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:54.081
<v Speaker 1>to play fucking aliens vs Predator and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm low on armor and it's best to act </v>

973
00:43:54.081 --> 00:43:54.800
<v Speaker 1>quick before you're in trouble.</v>

974
00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:59.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you see a guy like ray rice </v>

975
00:43:59.880 --> 00:43:59.880
<v Speaker 1>clock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a chick like that,</v>

976
00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:03.320
<v Speaker 1>literally that guy might not even be </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to control that kind of a thing.</v>

977
00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:06.710
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not giving him a free pass at all.</v>

978
00:44:07.010 --> 00:44:09.170
<v Speaker 1>What he did was totally fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would've never done it.</v>

979
00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:12.890
<v Speaker 1>But when you're dealing with head </v>
<v Speaker 1>trauma,</v>

980
00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:16.400
<v Speaker 1>major head trauma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy has been hit who knows how many</v>

981
00:44:16.401 --> 00:44:18.380
<v Speaker 1>times throughout high school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>College.</v>

982
00:44:18.381 --> 00:44:23.381
<v Speaker 1>And in the pros,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he has collided with some giant </v>

983
00:44:23.381 --> 00:44:23.381
<v Speaker 1>men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

984
00:44:23.381 --> 00:44:26.270
<v Speaker 1>there is a hundred percent likelihood of</v>
<v Speaker 1>head trauma going on there.</v>

985
00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:29.810
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you punch him,</v>

986
00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:32.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and who knows</v>

987
00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:35.070
<v Speaker 2>how much control he has over that </v>
<v Speaker 2>switch.</v>

988
00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:37.470
<v Speaker 2>You would like to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well me Matt,</v>

989
00:44:37.471 --> 00:44:40.470
<v Speaker 2>the full charge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have full control of my situation,</v>

990
00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:44.220
<v Speaker 2>but I don't claim to know what it's like</v>
<v Speaker 2>to operate his body and mind.</v>

991
00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:46.830
<v Speaker 2>I definitely don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or hers.</v>

992
00:44:46.860 --> 00:44:48.900
<v Speaker 2>Why did she punch him?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't have praised them.</v>

993
00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:52.140
<v Speaker 2>Bitch woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>

994
00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:53.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean who knows?</v>

995
00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:56.400
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he did something but we didn't see</v>
<v Speaker 2>before that,</v>

996
00:44:56.820 --> 00:45:01.820
<v Speaker 2>but it's just craziness and should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>avoided at all costs and definitely </v>

997
00:45:02.041 --> 00:45:07.041
<v Speaker 2>don't get married to somebody that that </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened with the to the fence or unless</v>

998
00:45:07.171 --> 00:45:09.420
<v Speaker 2>you really both don't ever do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

999
00:45:09.421 --> 00:45:10.890
<v Speaker 2>is that possible?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again?</v>

1000
00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:15.440
<v Speaker 2>Can people grow and learn and so this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is beyond say sister is the head.</v>

1001
00:45:15.441 --> 00:45:19.200
<v Speaker 2>This was no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it doesn't really different story.</v>

1002
00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:21.270
<v Speaker 2>You son of a bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're racist.</v>

1003
00:45:22.330 --> 00:45:24.090
<v Speaker 2>He's a totally different groups of black</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1004
00:45:24.250 --> 00:45:26.010
<v Speaker 2>Say sister started hitting Jay Z.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1005
00:45:26.011 --> 00:45:26.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I thought.</v>

1006
00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:27.800
<v Speaker 2>Who knows what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1007
00:45:28.050 --> 00:45:28.610
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mixed.</v>

1008
00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:32.700
<v Speaker 2>Jay Z just dealt with it like a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He threw money at it.</v>

1009
00:45:33.010 --> 00:45:35.940
<v Speaker 2>It should have not a fifth should </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking thrown diamonds on the ground.</v>

1010
00:45:35.941 --> 00:45:36.600
<v Speaker 2>So she slipped.</v>

1011
00:45:40.250 --> 00:45:43.200
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it funny what pitches we are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We get a fascinating.</v>

1012
00:45:43.201 --> 00:45:48.201
<v Speaker 2>What do you think he said?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She said to him exactly what you're </v>

1013
00:45:48.201 --> 00:45:48.930
<v Speaker 2>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So worried,</v>

1014
00:45:49.270 --> 00:45:53.820
<v Speaker 2>worried about death and obscurity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Worried about space.</v>

1015
00:45:54.450 --> 00:45:56.760
<v Speaker 2>Worried about the fact that we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>floating around.</v>

1016
00:45:56.910 --> 00:45:57.900
<v Speaker 2>They landed A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1017
00:45:57.901 --> 00:46:00.720
<v Speaker 2>here's a great story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They landed a fucking comment.</v>

1018
00:46:00.990 --> 00:46:05.990
<v Speaker 2>They landed on a comet and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy who landed on the comet was </v>

1019
00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:09.060
<v Speaker 2>wearing a shirt that had all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>photos,</v>

1020
00:46:09.620 --> 00:46:14.460
<v Speaker 2>are these drawings of women on it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>land on a comment.</v>

1021
00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:17.070
<v Speaker 2>They landed a drone on a comment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It says,</v>

1022
00:46:17.071 --> 00:46:19.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't care if you landed on </v>
<v Speaker 2>spacecraft,</v>

1023
00:46:19.470 --> 00:46:21.330
<v Speaker 2>landed a spacecraft.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll say it again.</v>

1024
00:46:21.570 --> 00:46:24.030
<v Speaker 2>I don't care if you land a space craft </v>
<v Speaker 2>on a comet,</v>

1025
00:46:24.210 --> 00:46:28.050
<v Speaker 2>your shirt is sexist and ostracizing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not kidding.</v>

1026
00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:31.470
<v Speaker 2>This is where our world is today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pull this up,</v>

<v Speaker 2>landed a spacecraft on a comment.</v>

1032
00:46:43.470 --> 00:46:48.470
<v Speaker 2>Your shirt is sexist and ostracizing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just God damn a beautiful </v>

1033
00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:51.270
<v Speaker 2>representation by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the shirt is designed by a woman.</v>

1034
00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:53.940
<v Speaker 2>And who said that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who said that to him?</v>

1035
00:46:53.941 --> 00:46:55.410
<v Speaker 2>That's an article.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was an article.</v>

1036
00:46:55.440 --> 00:47:00.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just a social justice </v>

1037
00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:00.720
<v Speaker 2>warrior status.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is funny about the Internet is that</v>

1038
00:47:00.721 --> 00:47:02.190
<v Speaker 2>everyone has.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone has a voice,</v>

1039
00:47:02.191 --> 00:47:04.110
<v Speaker 2>but the bad thing is everyone has a </v>
<v Speaker 2>voice.</v>

1040
00:47:04.460 --> 00:47:09.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at this carefully and is fucking </v>

1041
00:47:13.531 --> 00:47:15.090
<v Speaker 2>beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's beautiful.</v>

1042
00:47:15.091 --> 00:47:19.020
<v Speaker 2>And it's just women in scantily clad </v>
<v Speaker 2>outfits.</v>

1043
00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:20.190
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's my question.</v>

1044
00:47:20.310 --> 00:47:22.190
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're willing to get real with this.</v>

1045
00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:24.700
<v Speaker 2>When you see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1046
00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:29.840
<v Speaker 2>maybe there's a better picture of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we can get a close up look at his </v>

1047
00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:29.840
<v Speaker 2>face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at his,</v>

1048
00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:29.840
<v Speaker 2>find his name and find a shirt.</v>

1049
00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:32.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there's some closeup photos of </v>
<v Speaker 2>it because there's a big event that they</v>

1050
00:47:32.891 --> 00:47:37.891
<v Speaker 2>had and this guy chose to wear this </v>
<v Speaker 2>shirt and everybody's freaking out that </v>

1051
00:47:37.891 --> 00:47:38.090
<v Speaker 2>he chose to wear the shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1052
00:47:39.250 --> 00:47:40.180
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are saying,</v>

1053
00:47:40.181 --> 00:47:42.520
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they wonder why women aren't accepted in</v>

1054
00:47:42.521 --> 00:47:44.770
<v Speaker 2>science and I don't even know that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>

1055
00:47:45.570 --> 00:47:49.930
<v Speaker 2>How much or how hard it is for women to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get into science or how easy it is.</v>

1056
00:47:49.931 --> 00:47:52.090
<v Speaker 2>I really don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not going to be talking out of my</v>

1057
00:47:52.091 --> 00:47:52.860
<v Speaker 2>ass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but look it.</v>

1058
00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:57.870
<v Speaker 2>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can see the picture and it's just </v>

1059
00:47:57.870 --> 00:47:59.080
<v Speaker 2>women in lingerie and fetish outfits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Comic Book.</v>

1060
00:47:59.081 --> 00:48:01.630
<v Speaker 2>It looks like wonder woman in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1061
00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:03.100
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say that.</v>

1062
00:48:03.101 --> 00:48:08.101
<v Speaker 2>I mean that chick has like a skin tight </v>
<v Speaker 2>leather core set and I can just now make</v>

1063
00:48:09.581 --> 00:48:10.450
<v Speaker 2>it out though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1064
00:48:10.451 --> 00:48:13.000
<v Speaker 2>it's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems like kind of cosmic too,</v>

1065
00:48:13.001 --> 00:48:13.210
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1066
00:48:13.210 --> 00:48:14.800
<v Speaker 2>What is that a son behind that one </v>
<v Speaker 2>chick?</v>

1067
00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:16.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks like Superhero.</v>

1068
00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:19.930
<v Speaker 2>Other planets involved in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it is.</v>

1069
00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:24.960
<v Speaker 2>You should be able to wear a shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of those of like someone's killing </v>

1070
00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:25.150
<v Speaker 2>children are those online and I'll wear </v>
<v Speaker 2>it for the next podcast.</v>

1071
00:48:26.310 --> 00:48:28.660
<v Speaker 2>You can order a bunch of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>find it,</v>

1072
00:48:29.350 --> 00:48:34.350
<v Speaker 2>find out who makes it online,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's where I'm willing to make the </v>

1073
00:48:34.350 --> 00:48:35.080
<v Speaker 2>guests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were it for a week at your hazing?</v>

1074
00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:36.500
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1075
00:48:36.970 --> 00:48:40.030
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if a woman makes it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how it could be sexist.</v>

1076
00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:42.100
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess it could be if you were.</v>

1077
00:48:42.101 --> 00:48:47.101
<v Speaker 2>It was sexist intentions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for some women it's not sexist at </v>

1078
00:48:47.101 --> 00:48:50.671
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For some women it's just sexy women in </v>

1079
00:48:50.671 --> 00:48:53.100
<v Speaker 2>seductive poses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like would you think that it would be </v>

1080
00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:54.640
<v Speaker 2>sexist if a woman had like Chippendale's</v>
<v Speaker 2>dudes all over her shirt?</v>

1081
00:48:54.700 --> 00:48:57.890
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't get upset about it and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't think it's either.</v>

1082
00:48:59.170 --> 00:49:02.380
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I wouldn't even necessarily think </v>
<v Speaker 2>she was a horny chick.</v>

1083
00:49:02.381 --> 00:49:07.381
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the dicks route that's a different </v>

1084
00:49:07.381 --> 00:49:07.381
<v Speaker 2>story had their dicks out and they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>holding onto him like,</v>

1085
00:49:07.381 --> 00:49:10.500
<v Speaker 2>like shotguns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't ignore dicks that events.</v>

1086
00:49:10.790 --> 00:49:12.280
<v Speaker 2>That wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't be mad.</v>

1087
00:49:12.281 --> 00:49:13.720
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say that shirt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexist.</v>

1088
00:49:13.810 --> 00:49:18.220
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't be upset at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So is the object objectification of men?</v>

1089
00:49:18.221 --> 00:49:19.930
<v Speaker 2>Is that acceptable?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the objective,</v>

1090
00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:22.810
<v Speaker 2>it is acceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's fine with that.</v>

1091
00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:25.000
<v Speaker 2>Do you see what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man?</v>

1092
00:49:25.210 --> 00:49:28.180
<v Speaker 2>You're going crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world's going to go a little crazy,</v>

1093
00:49:28.181 --> 00:49:33.181
<v Speaker 2>but there there is a double standard </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the sexes and I think it has a lot </v>

1094
00:49:33.181 --> 00:49:36.301
<v Speaker 2>to do with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you know when men are the </v>

1095
00:49:36.301 --> 00:49:36.790
<v Speaker 2>aggressors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>

1096
00:49:37.420 --> 00:49:39.460
<v Speaker 2>And that's the difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1097
00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:41.620
<v Speaker 2>and when we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we get raped,</v>

1098
00:49:41.621 --> 00:49:42.190
<v Speaker 2>nobody cares.</v>

1099
00:49:42.460 --> 00:49:46.360
<v Speaker 2>No one cares that it's a joke photo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a big joke,</v>

1100
00:49:46.361 --> 00:49:49.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I put up the other day of this dude</v>

1101
00:49:49.121 --> 00:49:54.121
<v Speaker 2>who was blacked out in these three girls</v>
<v Speaker 2>with bikinis or climbing all over him </v>

1102
00:49:54.121 --> 00:49:55.480
<v Speaker 2>and the caption was captured,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was poorly spelled,</v>

1103
00:49:55.481 --> 00:49:57.210
<v Speaker 2>but it was something like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1104
00:49:57.220 --> 00:49:59.980
<v Speaker 2>how different would it be if the sexes </v>
<v Speaker 2>were reversed?</v>

1105
00:50:00.090 --> 00:50:04.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In this particular photo blacked out.</v>

1106
00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:06.280
<v Speaker 2>You almost go to jail just for that </v>
<v Speaker 2>photo.</v>

1107
00:50:06.281 --> 00:50:11.281
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if it was an overweight woman that </v>

1108
00:50:11.281 --> 00:50:11.350
<v Speaker 2>was blacked out and a bunch of guys that</v>
<v Speaker 2>were like studly,</v>

1109
00:50:11.410 --> 00:50:16.120
<v Speaker 2>every woman wants to fuck guys still.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It still be a creepy photo.</v>

1110
00:50:16.970 --> 00:50:19.240
<v Speaker 2>Go down as harassment and borderline sex</v>
<v Speaker 2>crime.</v>

1111
00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:22.330
<v Speaker 2>Why are they giving this guy a hard time</v>
<v Speaker 2>for his fucking shirt?</v>

1112
00:50:22.340 --> 00:50:23.140
<v Speaker 2>They sit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let them.</v>

1113
00:50:23.141 --> 00:50:25.730
<v Speaker 2>God Damn bought on a comment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let them have.</v>

1114
00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:28.670
<v Speaker 2>Can you land a robot on the comment I </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't even know was possible.</v>

1115
00:50:28.910 --> 00:50:32.630
<v Speaker 2>I wish a hundred miles an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish his reaction though when she said</v>

1116
00:50:32.631 --> 00:50:34.310
<v Speaker 2>that to him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish he would just be like,</v>

1117
00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:38.240
<v Speaker 2>shut the fuck up and locked away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But hold on a second.</v>

1118
00:50:38.241 --> 00:50:39.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't think someone said anything to </v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

1119
00:50:39.770 --> 00:50:44.090
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This isn't someone who interviewed him.</v>

1120
00:50:44.270 --> 00:50:47.050
<v Speaker 2>This is a review of him doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1121
00:50:47.060 --> 00:50:48.660
<v Speaker 2>The girl with the mic doesn't care at </v>
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

1122
00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:50.420
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the eyes.</v>

1123
00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:53.210
<v Speaker 2>I thought this was him going like her </v>
<v Speaker 2>freaking out.</v>

1124
00:50:53.211 --> 00:50:54.040
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1125
00:50:54.060 --> 00:50:56.330
<v Speaker 2>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's by a dude,</v>

1126
00:50:56.420 --> 00:51:01.420
<v Speaker 2>the articles written by two and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimately just trying to get laid to.</v>

1127
00:51:02.020 --> 00:51:05.360
<v Speaker 2>That's the funny part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is doing what he thinks is right.</v>

1128
00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:06.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1129
00:51:06.141 --> 00:51:07.490
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's pointing it out.</v>

1130
00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:12.520
<v Speaker 2>He thinks it's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we could disagree with them all </v>

1131
00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:12.520
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

1132
00:51:13.020 --> 00:51:15.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's a big deal,</v>

1133
00:51:15.051 --> 00:51:18.770
<v Speaker 2>but I also think people are so fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>hung up on bodies,</v>

1134
00:51:18.771 --> 00:51:23.771
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are really hung up on the use of </v>

1135
00:51:23.771 --> 00:51:24.820
<v Speaker 2>people's bodies and imagery and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1136
00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:30.100
<v Speaker 2>comic book depictions of bodies and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>primarily a female issue,</v>

1137
00:51:30.530 --> 00:51:32.900
<v Speaker 2>primarily of objectification of female </v>
<v Speaker 2>issue.</v>

1138
00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:38.290
<v Speaker 2>Like if a guy showed up at work and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>had a bunch of male bodies,</v>

1139
00:51:38.930 --> 00:51:43.070
<v Speaker 2>just like really yolked superhero male </v>
<v Speaker 2>bodies all over his shirt,</v>

1140
00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:44.660
<v Speaker 2>it would just be hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It will be fine.</v>

1141
00:51:44.690 --> 00:51:45.980
<v Speaker 2>It would be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be funny.</v>

1142
00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:51.100
<v Speaker 2>But if he shows up with these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these looking at these women in these </v>

1143
00:51:51.100 --> 00:51:51.100
<v Speaker 2>photos are these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1144
00:51:51.100 --> 00:51:54.110
<v Speaker 2>these images on a shirt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just all like perfect specimen.</v>

1145
00:51:54.380 --> 00:51:55.160
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1146

1150
00:52:08.710 --> 00:52:12.770

<v Speaker 2>fat shaming version.</v>

1151
00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:15.100
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1152
00:52:15.110 --> 00:52:15.800
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1153
00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:19.010
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of people that think those </v>
<v Speaker 2>images look good.</v>

1154
00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:20.680
<v Speaker 2>Is it sexist?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

1155
00:52:21.060 --> 00:52:22.650
<v Speaker 2>what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because of sexless Matt.</v>

1156
00:52:22.790 --> 00:52:27.790
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is sexy exactly is sexist is when </v>

1157
00:52:27.790 --> 00:52:30.851
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think discriminator treat people </v>

1158
00:52:30.851 --> 00:52:31.280
<v Speaker 2>differently based on their sex or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way they look.</v>

1159
00:52:31.390 --> 00:52:36.390
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so is having a shirt with a bunch of </v>

1160
00:52:36.390 --> 00:52:37.220
<v Speaker 2>pretty women on it like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that objectifying women?</v>

1161
00:52:37.370 --> 00:52:38.140
<v Speaker 2>Kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1162
00:52:38.350 --> 00:52:40.190
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to some degree.</v>

1163
00:52:40.490 --> 00:52:43.150
<v Speaker 2>But if you're asking me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't find it offensive ones.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Just all cock and balls shaped right.</v>

1191
00:53:54.810 --> 00:53:59.810
<v Speaker 2>Bushes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that would get you in </v>

1192
00:53:59.810 --> 00:53:59.810
<v Speaker 2>trouble with the Neighborhood </v>
<v Speaker 2>Association?</v>

<v Speaker 2>would not like that one.</v>

1194

<v Speaker 2>They know exactly what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a Bush.</v>

1195
00:54:02.940 --> 00:54:07.940

<v Speaker 2>Once you're in a neighborhood,</v>

1198
00:54:09.181 --> 00:54:14.181
<v Speaker 2>like I'm assuming like if you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>people cutting your bushes that it's a </v>

1199
00:54:14.181 --> 00:54:14.181
<v Speaker 2>nice neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they can see that shit,</v>

1200
00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:16.140
<v Speaker 2>they feel like they can say shit about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1201
00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:18.140
<v Speaker 2>I assume.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What could,</v>

00:54:18.270 --> 00:54:19.170
<v Speaker 2>what does that,</v>

<v Speaker 2>this fabric,</v>

1204
00:54:20.890 --> 00:54:23.430
<v Speaker 2>a fabric.com</v>
<v Speaker 2>has all these sexual.</v>

1205
00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:26.250
<v Speaker 2>That's fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fabric that is sexist,</v>

1206
00:54:26.251 --> 00:54:28.590
<v Speaker 2>Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's male.</v>

1207
00:54:28.591 --> 00:54:32.730
<v Speaker 2>Patriarchy and I'm all bad things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1208
00:54:33.060 --> 00:54:34.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to write a blog about how </v>
<v Speaker 2>great that is.</v>

1209
00:54:37.890 --> 00:54:38.780
<v Speaker 2>How much of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1210
00:54:39.090 --> 00:54:44.090
<v Speaker 2>how much of it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there a line that ever has to be </v>

1211
00:54:44.090 --> 00:54:44.090
<v Speaker 2>drawn?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1212
00:54:44.090 --> 00:54:45.600
<v Speaker 2>what if you had like tits?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if,</v>

1213
00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:48.780
<v Speaker 2>what if these girls on this shirt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're completely naked instead of these.</v>

1214
00:54:48.980 --> 00:54:50.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these outfits are tiny.</v>

1215
00:54:50.251 --> 00:54:53.490
<v Speaker 2>They're wearing these little corsets and</v>
<v Speaker 2>thongs.</v>

1216
00:54:53.491 --> 00:54:56.310
<v Speaker 2>They're acids are hanging out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you ask me totally naked,</v>

1217
00:54:56.490 --> 00:54:57.600
<v Speaker 2>if you ask me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fine.</v>

1218
00:54:57.720 --> 00:54:59.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just the body.</v>

1219
00:54:59.910 --> 00:55:01.500
<v Speaker 2>But if you're a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1220
00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:04.290
<v Speaker 2>And you're working with a guy and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of creepy anyway.</v>

1221
00:55:04.340 --> 00:55:09.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he's got a shirt with naked chicks </v>

1222
00:55:09.340 --> 00:55:11.151
<v Speaker 2>all over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It probably wouldn't like it if I was a </v>

1223
00:55:11.151 --> 00:55:11.151
<v Speaker 2>walking hate it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that is kind of sexual harassment,</v>

1224
00:55:11.151 --> 00:55:11.151
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1225
00:55:11.151 --> 00:55:15.980
<v Speaker 2>So if that sexual harassment and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>take it just one step before that,</v>

1226
00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:20.100
<v Speaker 2>which is their scantily clad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty God damn close to them being</v>

1227
00:55:20.101 --> 00:55:22.730
<v Speaker 2>naked step before it.</v>

1228
00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:26.400
<v Speaker 2>Got to see how if you were a chick and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you around a guy wearing that,</v>

1229
00:55:26.401 --> 00:55:31.401
<v Speaker 2>that would be on the creep tip because </v>
<v Speaker 2>although we would like to compare it to </v>

1230
00:55:31.401 --> 00:55:33.440
<v Speaker 2>men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem is like a woman with a,</v>

1231
00:55:33.540 --> 00:55:36.450
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of men on her shirt is probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>not going to rape you.</v>

1232
00:55:36.570 --> 00:55:38.100
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1233
00:55:38.180 --> 00:55:39.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's not even the worst thing in the</v>

1234
00:55:39.781 --> 00:55:40.870
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If a woman ramps you,</v>

1235
00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:44.850
<v Speaker 2>not that most men wearing this shirt </v>
<v Speaker 2>would rape you because most wouldn't.</v>

1236
00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:49.940
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's a few guys who would rape </v>

1237
00:55:49.940 --> 00:55:51.940
<v Speaker 2>you and it only takes one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's face it before just,</v>

1238
00:55:51.950 --> 00:55:56.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a huge inconvenience or they </v>

1239
00:55:56.950 --> 00:55:58.521
<v Speaker 2>probably would wear like some Mr Rogers </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit so that you would never see it </v>

1240
00:55:58.521 --> 00:55:58.521
<v Speaker 2>coming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1241
00:55:58.521 --> 00:56:00.820
<v Speaker 2>You got to watch out with those guys for</v>
<v Speaker 2>that with the sweater vest sweater.</v>

1242
00:56:01.420 --> 00:56:03.030
<v Speaker 2>That's a dead giveaway.</v>

1243
00:56:04.850 --> 00:56:06.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just to make a good point,</v>

1244
00:56:07.020 --> 00:56:12.020
<v Speaker 2>I would hate to be a chick working in an</v>
<v Speaker 2>office with a dude who was creeping on </v>

1245
00:56:12.020 --> 00:56:12.020
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1246
00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:17.120
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever worked in an office where </v>

1247
00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:17.120
<v Speaker 2>chick was creeping on you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1248
00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:19.050
<v Speaker 2>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember a chick creeping on me.</v>

1249
00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:24.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was definitely flirting and </v>

1250
00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:24.080
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1251
00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:24.080
<v Speaker 2>Now that you mentioned I did hook up </v>
<v Speaker 2>with this,</v>

1252
00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:24.730
<v Speaker 2>that I worked at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that seems fun.</v>

1253
00:56:24.790 --> 00:56:26.980
<v Speaker 2>That's like voluntary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fun and say Hook Up.</v>

1254
00:56:27.750 --> 00:56:32.750
<v Speaker 2>But you hear about the one dude that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like jizzing in this chick's coffee for </v>

1255
00:56:32.750 --> 00:56:32.750
<v Speaker 2>like a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1256
00:56:32.750 --> 00:56:32.810
<v Speaker 2>That's awful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1257
00:56:32.890 --> 00:56:37.890
<v Speaker 2>And then they caught him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He admitted he'd been in her coffee for </v>

1258
00:56:37.890 --> 00:56:37.890
<v Speaker 2>a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's so great.</v>

1259
00:56:37.890 --> 00:56:39.980
<v Speaker 2>How long did it take from an admitted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whereas he just like bad.</v>

1260

01:02:21.940 --> 01:02:26.190
<v Speaker 2>but if you got caught drinking come,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd be like police,</v>

1375

<v Speaker 2>You'd go right to be like,</v>

1376
01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:34.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to drink.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I might be a little embarrassed </v>

1377
01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:34.160
<v Speaker 2>to admit that I drank com.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you found a.</v>

1379
01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:38.580
<v Speaker 2>Have you found a dude he knew that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>came and your Coffee Cup.</v>

1380
01:02:38.970 --> 01:02:40.830
<v Speaker 2>Would you be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you be like,</v>

1381
01:02:40.831 --> 01:02:42.780
<v Speaker 2>look man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't do that anymore.</v>

1382
01:02:43.450 --> 01:02:46.380
<v Speaker 2>It was at work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it was like at a job.</v>

1383
01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:48.050
<v Speaker 2>Can we talk about this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1384
01:02:48.060 --> 01:02:49.110
<v Speaker 2>would you be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1385
01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:51.300
<v Speaker 2>don't do this anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you hit them?</v>

1386
01:02:51.510 --> 01:02:53.640
<v Speaker 2>Would you just go immediately to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>authorities?</v>

1387
01:02:53.641 --> 01:02:56.340
<v Speaker 2>Like how would you handle it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've kissed him on the cheek and go,</v>

1388
01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:58.350
<v Speaker 2>you fucked up buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea.</v>

1389
01:02:58.351 --> 01:03:03.351
<v Speaker 2>I think I will report it within the </v>
<v Speaker 2>company and let them take it to the </v>

1390
01:03:03.351 --> 01:03:03.351
<v Speaker 2>cops.</v>

1391
01:03:03.351 --> 01:03:06.170
<v Speaker 2>Don't you think that a dude coming into </v>
<v Speaker 2>your coffee cup is so extreme that you'd</v>

1392
01:03:06.180 --> 01:03:08.340
<v Speaker 2>be real cautious about how you </v>
<v Speaker 2>interacted with them?</v>

1393
01:03:09.180 --> 01:03:11.430
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you'd beat his ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you that.</v>

1394
01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:13.910
<v Speaker 2>This is why if a guy came in your crop </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you drank it,</v>

1395
01:03:13.940 --> 01:03:15.060
<v Speaker 2>you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

1396
01:03:15.690 --> 01:03:16.980
<v Speaker 2>Like what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1397
01:03:16.981 --> 01:03:18.230
<v Speaker 2>who?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who are you man?</v>

1398
01:03:18.231 --> 01:03:19.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you a fucking serial killer?</v>

1399
01:03:19.861 --> 01:03:24.150
<v Speaker 2>Or something like what kind of a person </v>
<v Speaker 2>can jerk off in your coffee and then sit</v>

1400
01:03:24.151 --> 01:03:27.540
<v Speaker 2>back and watch as you drink it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like a mentally ill person.</v>

1401
01:03:27.541 --> 01:03:29.700
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you didn't have to think like how you</v>

1402
01:03:29.730 --> 01:03:32.040
<v Speaker 2>handled that situation whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 2>you beat their ass.</v>

1403
01:03:32.530 --> 01:03:33.990
<v Speaker 2>No violent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What'd you go?</v>

1404
01:03:34.070 --> 01:03:36.450
<v Speaker 2>Then I would take the Coffee Cup and </v>
<v Speaker 2>smashed it over his head.</v>

1405
01:03:36.451 --> 01:03:40.050
<v Speaker 2>And then to that man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you hit someone with a Coffee Cup,</v>

1406
01:03:40.051 --> 01:03:41.340
<v Speaker 2>that's like a fucking deadly weapon.</v>

1407
01:03:41.340 --> 01:03:46.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if he had to come in my fucking </v>

1408
01:03:46.340 --> 01:03:46.340
<v Speaker 2>coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1409
01:03:46.340 --> 01:03:47.890
<v Speaker 2>But if he had saliva and your coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you stab them with a broken clock?</v>

1410
01:03:48.170 --> 01:03:49.560
<v Speaker 2>Spit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would scream at him.</v>

1411
01:03:49.561 --> 01:03:52.380
<v Speaker 2>They'd go to the bus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But comes completely different.</v>

1412
01:03:52.381 --> 01:03:57.381
<v Speaker 2>What if your hot cocoa is different?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you have to be pretty close Cox </v>

1413
01:03:57.381 --> 01:03:57.690
<v Speaker 2>not regular snack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would.</v>

1414
01:03:57.760 --> 01:03:59.860
<v Speaker 2>It would get violent probably if I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it.</v>

1415
01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:01.520
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you rather drink guys?</v>

1416
01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:06.560
<v Speaker 2>Louis or a load?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably a load because I'm sure it </v>

1417
01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:09.471
<v Speaker 2>tastes better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It tastes better smoke because there's </v>

1418
01:04:09.471 --> 01:04:09.471
<v Speaker 2>not one girl that goes.</v>

1419
01:04:11.730 --> 01:04:16.730
<v Speaker 2>He's a mediator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He opens your mouth and spit it.</v>

1420
01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:20.940
<v Speaker 2>That should be a fucking new game show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should be a new game.</v>

1421
01:04:20.941 --> 01:04:25.941
<v Speaker 2>Show me smokers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Spit in your mouth and see how many </v>

1422
01:04:25.941 --> 01:04:29.060
<v Speaker 2>times you can take without swallowing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Throwing up a smoker,</v>

1423
01:04:29.070 --> 01:04:31.950
<v Speaker 2>hooking longyis and spitting in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>mouth and the every.</v>

1424
01:04:31.951 --> 01:04:33.960
<v Speaker 2>For every lucky that goes in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get 10 grand.</v>

1425
01:04:34.020 --> 01:04:35.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that'd be fun to train for.</v>

1426
01:04:35.491 --> 01:04:37.140
<v Speaker 2>I know that much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know why?</v>

1427
01:04:37.141 --> 01:04:39.600
<v Speaker 2>Because there's some people with some </v>
<v Speaker 2>serious fucking student loans.</v>

1428
01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:42.930
<v Speaker 2>You know like I know a friend who has </v>
<v Speaker 2>$300,000</v>

1429
01:04:42.931 --> 01:04:47.931
<v Speaker 2>in student loans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet you could hook loogies in his </v>

1430
01:04:47.931 --> 01:04:50.061
<v Speaker 2>mouth for a couple of days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would be very tempted this month to do</v>

1431
01:04:50.641 --> 01:04:51.630
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to play that game.</v>

1432
01:04:52.290 --> 01:04:53.640
<v Speaker 2>I hate to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I do it,</v>

1433
01:04:53.641 --> 01:04:56.430
<v Speaker 2>but I think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you could start to think about it.</v>

1434
01:04:56.640 --> 01:05:01.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to start a business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I look into some Novacane from my </v>

<v Speaker 2>worked as a contractor a couple of </v>

1441
01:05:13.971 --> 01:05:15.120
<v Speaker 2>times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did it twice.</v>

1442
01:05:15.660 --> 01:05:20.660
<v Speaker 2>He did it just because he needed money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does he work for when he does not have </v>

<v Speaker 2>I know people,</v>

1446
01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:31.320
<v Speaker 2>people get to that situation where they </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a serious debt and no way out of </v>

<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

1449
01:05:32.501 --> 01:05:35.590
<v Speaker 2>There's no doubt about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Spitting out cum in your mouth.</v>

1450
01:05:35.591 --> 01:05:37.810
<v Speaker 2>That's a different game show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's higher stakes.</v>

1451
01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:39.730
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what God fear factor cancel.</v>

1462

<v Speaker 2>They had to see how I would interact </v>

1476
01:06:41.010 --> 01:06:41.230
<v Speaker 2>with people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So um,</v>

<v Speaker 2>camera crew and just stuck cameras in </v>

1478
01:06:47.250 --> 01:06:47.590
<v Speaker 2>people's faces and start asking them </v>
<v Speaker 2>questions like,</v>

01:07:11.670 --> 01:07:13.390
<v Speaker 2>You're getting too busy already,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1489
01:07:13.910 --> 01:07:16.150
<v Speaker 2>I'll do be doing less of this and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>better at this.</v>

1490
01:07:16.180 --> 01:07:20.410
<v Speaker 2>What if somebody like live leak bought </v>
<v Speaker 2>the name fear factor in like,</v>

1491
01:07:20.411 --> 01:07:25.411
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we want you to do fear of not doing </v>

1492
01:07:25.411 --> 01:07:25.411
<v Speaker 2>anything different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1493
01:07:25.411 --> 01:07:27.910
<v Speaker 2>The only way I would ever do that again </v>
<v Speaker 2>is if they broke the bank.</v>

1494
01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:33.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean they'd have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd have to literally do some shit that </v>

1495
01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:35.350
<v Speaker 2>would bankrupt a small foreign country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Drown you in cash.</v>

1496
01:07:35.740 --> 01:07:37.690
<v Speaker 2>I'd have to literally make so much </v>
<v Speaker 2>money,</v>

1497
01:07:37.691 --> 01:07:41.450
<v Speaker 2>I would think about like giant hunting </v>
<v Speaker 2>preserves that I could buy,</v>

1498
01:07:41.950 --> 01:07:44.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in Colorado by a thousand acres and</v>

1499
01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:49.050
<v Speaker 2>set up a fucking solar log cabin and </v>
<v Speaker 2>vibe Brian over for dinner and then hunt</v>

1500
01:07:49.090 --> 01:07:52.980
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No ever have things like Brian.</v>

1501
01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:55.450
<v Speaker 2>Brian's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like the puppy.</v>

1502
01:07:55.451 --> 01:07:58.220
<v Speaker 2>You keep her on the house barks when </v>
<v Speaker 2>Shit's going down.</v>

1503
01:07:59.870 --> 01:08:01.900
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to chase him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So rude.</v>

1504
01:08:02.380 --> 01:08:04.930
<v Speaker 2>I had a friend that went to one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>

1505
01:08:04.931 --> 01:08:06.580
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have these hunting ranches.</v>

1506
01:08:06.610 --> 01:08:09.590
<v Speaker 2>It's really kind of fucked up where they</v>
<v Speaker 2>will let an animal out there,</v>

1507
01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:12.380
<v Speaker 2>like which animal do you want to hunt </v>
<v Speaker 2>and what not,</v>

1508
01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:15.290
<v Speaker 2>like have a menu and you go and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>point it.</v>

1509
01:08:15.291 --> 01:08:16.010
<v Speaker 2>And like this is</v>

1510
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:17.910
<v Speaker 1>one deer that has awesome antlers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1511
01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:19.700
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let out number a.</v>

1512
01:08:19.850 --> 01:08:23.480
<v Speaker 1>So the open the cage and this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing goes wandering out.</v>

1513
01:08:23.481 --> 01:08:28.481
<v Speaker 1>It goes right to the feeder because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's like a feeder that the deer's </v>

1514
01:08:28.481 --> 01:08:31.570
<v Speaker 1>eat from every day and you just sit and </v>
<v Speaker 1>wait in front of the feet or for him to </v>

1515
01:08:31.570 --> 01:08:31.620
<v Speaker 1>show up and then you blast them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oof,</v>

1516
01:08:31.660 --> 01:08:33.650
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean look,</v>

1517
01:08:33.710 --> 01:08:38.710
<v Speaker 1>I guess that's better than farming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess that's better than just,</v>

1518
01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:42.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>raise their cow houses I guess,</v>

1519
01:08:43.250 --> 01:08:44.710
<v Speaker 1>but it's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the only thing,</v>

1520
01:08:44.980 --> 01:08:47.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not a big area either,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so like a couple hundred acres.</v>

1521
01:08:47.530 --> 01:08:50.150
<v Speaker 1>It's a pretty small.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's big for a yard,</v>

1522
01:08:50.510 --> 01:08:52.850
<v Speaker 1>but it's not big for where a deer can </v>
<v Speaker 1>get away from you.</v>

1523
01:08:52.940 --> 01:08:53.560
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1524
01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:55.580
<v Speaker 1>they just let us fuck her out and you go</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking for them,</v>

1525
01:08:55.581 --> 01:08:56.890
<v Speaker 1>but they keep pens.</v>

1526
01:08:57.080 --> 01:09:02.080
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is one of the craziest things I've </v>

1527
01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:02.080
<v Speaker 1>ever heard of in my life and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>totally legal.</v>

1528
01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:02.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it is.</v>

1529
01:09:03.050 --> 01:09:04.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about all that.</v>

1530
01:09:05.510 --> 01:09:07.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems.</v>

1531
01:09:07.610 --> 01:09:11.470
<v Speaker 1>It seems like a good way to get antlers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1532
01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:16.480
<v Speaker 1>if you want to make sure you shoot a </v>
<v Speaker 1>deer with a big giant fucking head of </v>

1533
01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:16.480
<v Speaker 1>antlers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

1534
01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:21.520
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's what the supermarket,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if somebody wanted to kill you just for </v>

1535
01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:24.310
<v Speaker 1>like your teeth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to know that you're so crazy.</v>

1536
01:09:24.330 --> 01:09:29.330
<v Speaker 1>It's worse than your teeth because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>lose your antlers every year and then </v>

1537
01:09:30.940 --> 01:09:33.080
<v Speaker 1>the that baby teeth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give them to you.</v>

1538
01:09:33.140 --> 01:09:36.320
<v Speaker 1>There's a whole thing about collecting </v>
<v Speaker 1>sheds.</v>

1539
01:09:36.380 --> 01:09:39.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like people collect these deer sheds and</v>

1540
01:09:39.231 --> 01:09:44.231
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that does is it lets </v>
<v Speaker 1>them know what kind of deer on their </v>

1541
01:09:44.231 --> 01:09:44.231
<v Speaker 1>land.</v>

1542
01:09:44.231 --> 01:09:44.780
<v Speaker 1>So if you go collect the sheds and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>find these big antlers,</v>

1543
01:09:44.781 --> 01:09:45.140
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

1544
01:09:45.141 --> 01:09:50.141
<v Speaker 1>there's a big deer on this land I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>even know about because a lot of them </v>

1545
01:09:50.141 --> 01:09:50.141
<v Speaker 1>they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there'll be like nocturnal,</v>

1546
01:09:50.141 --> 01:09:55.090
<v Speaker 1>like especially when there's like </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting pressure or they think that </v>

1547
01:09:55.090 --> 01:09:57.521
<v Speaker 1>there's too many people around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They bed down during the day and they </v>

1548
01:09:57.521 --> 01:09:57.521
<v Speaker 1>only come out and eat at night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you don't,</v>

1549
01:09:57.521 --> 01:10:00.560
<v Speaker 1>you don't even see them there until you </v>
<v Speaker 1>find these antlers like running around.</v>

1550
01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:05.800
<v Speaker 1>So it's worse than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone would want to kill you for some </v>

1551
01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:07.070
<v Speaker 1>shit that you throw away every year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then there's the meat,</v>

1552
01:10:07.810 --> 01:10:12.810
<v Speaker 1>the meat's delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So sweet potato and garlic,</v>

1553
01:10:14.310 --> 01:10:19.310
<v Speaker 1>little semen and coffee to full charge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to wear that fucking shirt with</v>

1554
01:10:20.961 --> 01:10:22.520
<v Speaker 1>all the guys on it and go sit in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>corner.</v>

1555
01:10:23.270 --> 01:10:25.160
<v Speaker 1>Fuckin terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible person shirt.</v>

1556
01:10:25.580 --> 01:10:30.580
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This shirt with all with all the tax on </v>

1557
01:10:30.580 --> 01:10:30.580
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1558
01:10:30.580 --> 01:10:30.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1559
01:10:30.580 --> 01:10:30.740
<v Speaker 1>We need a name for that shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should do that.</v>

1560
01:10:30.741 --> 01:10:34.070
<v Speaker 1>Like one day where the shirt will get </v>
<v Speaker 1>them tailored.</v>

1561
01:10:34.100 --> 01:10:35.540
<v Speaker 1>Would you wear them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I got stuff tailored,</v>

1562
01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:37.350
<v Speaker 1>I'll wear a cream pie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1563
01:10:37.940 --> 01:10:42.940
<v Speaker 1>Try to find the gayest material that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could find online and we'll bring it to </v>

1564
01:10:42.940 --> 01:10:43.700
<v Speaker 1>a tailor and we'll have some suits made </v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

1565
01:10:44.060 --> 01:10:45.860
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen David shows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Butthole hat?</v>

01:12:24.420 --> 01:12:29.420
<v Speaker 1>This is a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just recently did this mural that he </v>

1603
01:12:30.091 --> 01:12:32.340
<v Speaker 1>posted on his instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Check this out.</v>

1604
01:12:32.610 --> 01:12:33.790
<v Speaker 1>How awesome.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He's a bad motherfucker,</v>

1606
01:12:36.180 --> 01:12:39.000
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's such a good guy too,</v>

1607
01:12:39.001 --> 01:12:40.710
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just like such a sweetheart.</v>

1608
01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:42.570
<v Speaker 1>And he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1609
01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:47.600
<v Speaker 1>he enjoys being shocking and he was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>victim of a lot of people freaking out </v>

1610
01:12:48.451 --> 01:12:52.860
<v Speaker 1>about one of his podcasts because he had</v>
<v Speaker 1>said something crazy about how uh,</v>

1611
01:12:53.250 --> 01:12:56.340
<v Speaker 1>he got a massage and forced them to suck</v>
<v Speaker 1>his dick forced.</v>

1612
01:12:56.760 --> 01:12:59.520
<v Speaker 1>But people got mad at him because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>raped somebody who kind of,</v>

1613
01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:00.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he exaggerates shit.</v>

1614
01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:05.280
<v Speaker 1>It's a girl he actually is dating or has</v>
<v Speaker 1>sex with on a regular basis.</v>

1615
01:13:05.281 --> 01:13:09.360
<v Speaker 1>Like his version of the story is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely accurate.</v>

1616
01:13:09.790 --> 01:13:14.790
<v Speaker 1>Like he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he leaves out stuff and add stuff to </v>

1617
01:13:14.790 --> 01:13:14.790
<v Speaker 1>make it more fucked up because he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

1618
01:13:15.010 --> 01:13:16.290
<v Speaker 1>he's fucking with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1619
01:13:16.350 --> 01:13:21.350
<v Speaker 1>You go down until you find this one that</v>
<v Speaker 1>looked good.</v>

1620
01:13:21.810 --> 01:13:22.570
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1621
01:13:25.020 --> 01:13:28.570
<v Speaker 1>He's got underwear on his face and him </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Bobby Lee and it's just,</v>

1622
01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:31.710
<v Speaker 1>it's so ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're doing all these crazy videos.</v>

1623
01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:33.510
<v Speaker 1>Hong Galaxies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other one.</v>

1624
01:13:33.810 --> 01:13:37.530
<v Speaker 1>There's Hong Dynasty and Hong Galaxy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just having fun.</v>

1625
01:13:37.620 --> 01:13:39.060
<v Speaker 1>That's what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just having fun.</v>

1626
01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:44.040
<v Speaker 1>He was on vice for awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when he did that thing where they're</v>

1627
01:13:44.041 --> 01:13:48.030
<v Speaker 1>doing the wrestling girls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when he did that thing where he,</v>

1628
01:13:48.031 --> 01:13:53.031
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>told that story about getting the </v>

1629
01:13:53.031 --> 01:13:53.031
<v Speaker 1>massage lady to blow them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1630
01:13:53.031 --> 01:13:53.910
<v Speaker 1>They kicked them off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vice.</v>

1631
01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:55.130
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1632
01:13:55.590 --> 01:14:00.590
<v Speaker 1>He got kicked off the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know a girl that used to write for </v>

1633
01:14:00.590 --> 01:14:03.081
<v Speaker 1>advice and she got kicked off for </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing something racist like two years </v>

1634
01:14:03.081 --> 01:14:03.480
<v Speaker 1>ago on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They went through a whole twitter feed.</v>

1635
01:14:03.510 --> 01:14:05.400
<v Speaker 1>I should rephrase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't get kicked off,</v>

1636
01:14:05.401 --> 01:14:10.401
<v Speaker 1>but they gave him an option.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The option was get rid of your </v>

1637
01:14:10.401 --> 01:14:10.401
<v Speaker 1>instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get rid of your twitter.</v>

1638
01:14:10.401 --> 01:14:12.070
<v Speaker 1>No more social media stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get rid of your podcasts.</v>

1639
01:14:12.610 --> 01:14:13.450
<v Speaker 2>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

1640
01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:18.550
<v Speaker 2>That's what I did my thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He spelled it w t two.</v>

1641
01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:23.560
<v Speaker 2>It was a fuck outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He pulled out his bank card.</v>

1642
01:14:24.541 --> 01:14:29.050
<v Speaker 2>I just want to show you how many Zeros.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of Zeros.</v>

1643
01:14:29.310 --> 01:14:31.960
<v Speaker 2>Those don't give a fuck points.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is fuck you money.</v>

1644
01:14:31.961 --> 01:14:36.380
<v Speaker 2>So fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1645
01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:36.800
<v Speaker 2>I see it.</v>

1646
01:14:36.990 --> 01:14:37.890
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1647
01:14:38.010 --> 01:14:40.650
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the real problem with twitter and</v>

1648
01:14:40.651 --> 01:14:45.651
<v Speaker 1>blogs is you get one point and even </v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter it's one point and then one </v>

1649
01:14:45.651 --> 01:14:50.271
<v Speaker 1>point and then one point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then when you know one person back and </v>

1650
01:14:50.271 --> 01:14:50.271
<v Speaker 1>you're playing tennis back and forth </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the idea,</v>

1651
01:14:50.910 --> 01:14:54.780
<v Speaker 1>it's just an ineffective way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate and resolve things.</v>

1652
01:14:55.080 --> 01:14:57.840
<v Speaker 1>Communicating live in person is the only</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

1653
01:14:57.930 --> 01:14:59.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything else is.</v>

1654
01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:04.760
<v Speaker 1>It only works if everybody agrees to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain series rules and like you </v>

1655
01:15:05.821 --> 01:15:10.821
<v Speaker 1>establish that you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate with someone the way you </v>

1656
01:15:10.821 --> 01:15:11.760
<v Speaker 1>would expect to be communicated with by </v>
<v Speaker 1>then like best case scenario.</v>

1657
01:15:11.790 --> 01:15:14.760
<v Speaker 2>I saw you on twitter sticking up for </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody that was just getting hammered.</v>

1658
01:15:15.510 --> 01:15:20.510
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was a person who wrote something </v>

1659
01:15:20.510 --> 01:15:20.640
<v Speaker 2>bad about me too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you were like,</v>

1660
01:15:20.641 --> 01:15:22.050
<v Speaker 2>hey look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can all have our opinions.</v>

1661
01:15:22.051 --> 01:15:22.590
<v Speaker 2>It's all good.</v>

1662
01:15:22.690 --> 01:15:27.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I never said anything shitty to </v>

1663
01:15:27.690 --> 01:15:27.690
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1664
01:15:27.690 --> 01:15:27.690
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1665
01:15:27.690 --> 01:15:30.571
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we went back and forth on twitter </v>

1666
01:15:30.571 --> 01:15:32.670
<v Speaker 1>we were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about the actual issue </v>

1667
01:15:32.670 --> 01:15:34.801
<v Speaker 1>at hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said a few ad homonym things about </v>

1668
01:15:34.801 --> 01:15:34.801
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they weren't anything really bad,</v>

1669
01:15:34.801 --> 01:15:36.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like something about um,</v>

1670
01:15:37.190 --> 01:15:40.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what qualifies you to that opinion?</v>

1671
01:15:40.271 --> 01:15:45.271
<v Speaker 1>Is it making people eat bugs on fear </v>
<v Speaker 1>factor things along those lines was </v>

1672
01:15:45.271 --> 01:15:45.271
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1673
01:15:45.370 --> 01:15:50.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you say something mean to me it </v>

1674
01:15:50.370 --> 01:15:52.681
<v Speaker 1>just means I'm going to stop </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicating with you because I know </v>

1675
01:15:52.681 --> 01:15:52.681
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting better at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1676
01:15:52.681 --> 01:15:56.691
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know when to engage people when not </v>

1677
01:15:56.691 --> 01:15:58.591
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I also know like what I get out of </v>

1678
01:15:58.591 --> 01:15:58.591
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1679
01:15:58.591 --> 01:15:58.591
<v Speaker 1>what do I get out of it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it,</v>

1680
01:15:58.591 --> 01:16:02.910
<v Speaker 1>something out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we can get a little long and get </v>

1681
01:16:02.910 --> 01:16:03.010
<v Speaker 1>through something civilly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get something out of it.</v>

1682
01:16:03.010 --> 01:16:03.870
<v Speaker 1>I feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1683
01:16:03.940 --> 01:16:08.940
<v Speaker 1>When I have an interaction with somebody</v>
<v Speaker 1>online and if there's some sort of a </v>

1684
01:16:08.940 --> 01:16:08.950
<v Speaker 1>minor disagreement we could end with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all good.</v>

1685
01:16:08.951 --> 01:16:10.690
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well thank you very much.</v>

1686
01:16:10.691 --> 01:16:11.470
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cool man.</v>

1687
01:16:11.930 --> 01:16:13.510
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked that.</v>

1688
01:16:13.690 --> 01:16:18.610
<v Speaker 1>So I go towards that as much as I can in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this life and I've made mistakes.</v>

1689
01:16:18.611 --> 01:16:23.611
<v Speaker 1>I think we all have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I go to someone's twitter page </v>

1690
01:16:23.611 --> 01:16:25.990
<v Speaker 1>and it's just a constant series of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking bitter back and forth feuds,</v>

1691
01:16:25.991 --> 01:16:28.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing it wrong,</v>

1692
01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:29.680
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're doing it wrong.</v>

1693
01:16:29.770 --> 01:16:30.540
<v Speaker 1>We're all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1694
01:16:30.700 --> 01:16:32.320
<v Speaker 1>we're all learning this as we go along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

1695
01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:34.800
<v Speaker 2>How'd you feel after the men see a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight?</v>

1696
01:16:34.801 --> 01:16:36.840
<v Speaker 2>I hate to keep bringing it up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just watched it last night.</v>

1697
01:16:36.841 --> 01:16:41.841
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brian and I have talked about this a </v>

1698
01:16:41.841 --> 01:16:41.841
<v Speaker 2>million times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brian's favorite piece of,</v>

1699
01:16:41.841 --> 01:16:46.230
<v Speaker 2>or my favorite piece of Brian's work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was this cool to get all these </v>

1700
01:16:46.340 --> 01:16:47.590
<v Speaker 2>pieces,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it easy songs.</v>

1701
01:16:48.580 --> 01:16:50.220
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

1702
01:16:50.790 --> 01:16:52.320
<v Speaker 2>there was a lot of negativity attached </v>
<v Speaker 2>to it,</v>

1703
01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:57.440
<v Speaker 2>a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of negative fucking comments and </v>

1704
01:16:57.440 --> 01:16:59.160
<v Speaker 2>tweets and messages I guess was like my </v>
<v Speaker 2>space back then.</v>

1705
01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:01.170
<v Speaker 2>But it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a lot of email.</v>

1706
01:17:01.171 --> 01:17:02.960
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people got my email and sent me</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of,</v>

1707
01:17:02.970 --> 01:17:06.030
<v Speaker 2>like really nasty shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was so poorly spelled,</v>

1708
01:17:06.810 --> 01:17:09.730
<v Speaker 2>like the majority of it to save.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think he's still</v>

1709
01:17:15.410 --> 01:17:20.410
<v Speaker 1>got a folder on my fucking email called,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just called fans because it was so </v>

1710
01:17:21.951 --> 01:17:23.540
<v Speaker 1>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was so ridiculous.</v>

1711
01:17:23.541 --> 01:17:24.500
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>

1712
01:17:24.501 --> 01:17:26.980
<v Speaker 1>Is this real?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is real.</v>

1713
01:17:26.990 --> 01:17:30.260
<v Speaker 1>People like it didn't even like the big </v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

1714
01:17:30.261 --> 01:17:32.810
<v Speaker 1>One of the big ones was them saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1715
01:17:32.811 --> 01:17:34.460
<v Speaker 1>he did it better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1716
01:17:34.461 --> 01:17:39.080
<v Speaker 1>I heard that cause he did it better just</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he did it better.</v>

1717
01:17:39.230 --> 01:17:44.230
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like fucking all jealous over </v>

1718
01:17:44.230 --> 01:17:46.961
<v Speaker 1>there because he did it better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But even that died off.</v>

1719
01:17:47.931 --> 01:17:51.440
<v Speaker 1>Man Stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a moment in comedy history.</v>

1720
01:17:51.620 --> 01:17:53.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But a lot of negativity,</v>

1721
01:17:53.541 --> 01:17:55.280
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of negativity attached to it.</v>

1722
01:17:55.580 --> 01:17:57.410
<v Speaker 1>But sometimes you gotta get your hands </v>
<v Speaker 1>dirty.</v>

1723
01:17:57.470 --> 01:17:59.300
<v Speaker 1>Well you stuck up for a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>

1724
01:17:59.301 --> 01:18:00.830
<v Speaker 1>And I remember you used to write about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1725
01:18:00.980 --> 01:18:02.930
<v Speaker 1>I think I used to see it on my space or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

1726
01:18:03.290 --> 01:18:05.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean you stick up for a lot of little </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys when you did that,</v>

1727
01:18:05.710 --> 01:18:07.370
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's where it all came from.</v>

1728
01:18:07.371 --> 01:18:12.371
<v Speaker 1>It came from guys like Johnny Sanchez </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting fucked over and are we getting </v>

1729
01:18:12.371 --> 01:18:14.480
<v Speaker 1>fucked over?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And countless numbers of dues.</v>

1730
01:18:14.481 --> 01:18:19.481
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes for a hostile environment when </v>

1731
01:18:19.481 --> 01:18:22.110
<v Speaker 1>you have to hit that flashing light at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the store because you know he's in the </v>

1732
01:18:22.110 --> 01:18:22.110
<v Speaker 1>back of the room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If everyone comics,</v>

1733
01:18:22.110 --> 01:18:22.910
<v Speaker 1>I'll have that little little signal </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1734
01:18:23.300 --> 01:18:28.300
<v Speaker 1>They would go over and flick the light a</v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of times because he was in the </v>

1735
01:18:28.300 --> 01:18:28.300
<v Speaker 1>back of the room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1736
01:18:28.300 --> 01:18:29.300
<v Speaker 1>That's just dark dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1737
01:18:29.780 --> 01:18:32.330
<v Speaker 1>but we're learning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1738
01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:33.380
<v Speaker 1>and we're learning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

1739
01:18:33.381 --> 01:18:38.381
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he had to start his career over </v>

1740
01:18:38.381 --> 01:18:38.381
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dudes,</v>

1741
01:18:38.381 --> 01:18:38.381
<v Speaker 1>good performer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1742
01:18:38.381 --> 01:18:40.400
<v Speaker 1>If he could start his career over again </v>
<v Speaker 1>and just do it the right way,</v>

1743
01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:41.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1744
01:18:41.751 --> 01:18:46.751
<v Speaker 1>he would have been a different person if</v>
<v Speaker 1>he started out today as opposed to back </v>

1745
01:18:46.751 --> 01:18:46.751
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1746
01:18:46.751 --> 01:18:48.950
<v Speaker 1>probably be a different person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you get off on the wrong foot and</v>

1747
01:18:48.951 --> 01:18:52.160
<v Speaker 1>you stay on that wrong foot and then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>justify your actions all along the way,</v>

1748
01:18:52.370 --> 01:18:57.370
<v Speaker 1>you get to a point where you're two </v>
<v Speaker 1>decades into a career that's bullshit </v>

1749
01:18:57.370 --> 01:18:57.370
<v Speaker 1>and you don't know how to write.</v>

1750
01:18:57.370 --> 01:18:58.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know how to write it all.</v>

1751
01:18:58.490 --> 01:19:00.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a super common thing.</v>

1752
01:19:00.290 --> 01:19:05.290
<v Speaker 1>You see that with biters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see that with guys going back and </v>

1753
01:19:05.290 --> 01:19:05.290
<v Speaker 1>trying to create new stuff and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1754
01:19:05.290 --> 01:19:06.560
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're lost at sea.</v>

1755
01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:09.320
<v Speaker 1>Like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you literally don't know how to do it.</v>

1756
01:19:10.330 --> 01:19:15.330
<v Speaker 1>Like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would see the contrast between the </v>

1757
01:19:15.330 --> 01:19:16.700
<v Speaker 1>stuff that they obviously stole and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stuff they obviously wrote.</v>

1758
01:19:16.810 --> 01:19:17.600
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

1759
01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:22.720
<v Speaker 1>oh good Lord,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this is like you're speaking two </v>

1760
01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:25.901
<v Speaker 1>different languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like one of these things is made </v>

1761
01:19:25.901 --> 01:19:25.901
<v Speaker 1>out of vegetables and one of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>things made out of shit.</v>

1762
01:19:28.390 --> 01:19:30.530
<v Speaker 1>It's so obvious to anybody who's paying </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention,</v>

1763
01:19:31.580 --> 01:19:32.390
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1764
01:19:32.420 --> 01:19:37.420
<v Speaker 1>It's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it's important to do negative </v>

1765
01:19:37.420 --> 01:19:37.420
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1766
01:19:37.420 --> 01:19:39.590
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depends on what's happening.</v>

1767
01:19:39.890 --> 01:19:44.890
<v Speaker 1>But it also exposed a lot about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>businessman that people didn't want to </v>

1768
01:19:44.890 --> 01:19:44.960
<v Speaker 1>believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1769
01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:49.520
<v Speaker 1>Because nobody wanted to believe that if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you like,</v>

1770
01:19:49.550 --> 01:19:52.160
<v Speaker 1>had a beef with some famous person who </v>
<v Speaker 1>had it out for you,</v>

1771
01:19:52.190 --> 01:19:53.830
<v Speaker 1>that they could ruin your career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1772
01:19:54.110 --> 01:19:55.820
<v Speaker 1>But he tried to do that to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1773
01:19:55.970 --> 01:19:58.220
<v Speaker 1>And he said he didn't have the power to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

1774
01:19:58.550 --> 01:20:01.070
<v Speaker 1>It did it work so far as the comedy </v>
<v Speaker 1>store,</v>

1775
01:20:01.100 --> 01:20:03.380
<v Speaker 1>was that where you work that weekend?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1776
01:20:03.381 --> 01:20:05.580
<v Speaker 1>he got me banned from that weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1777
01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:08.160
<v Speaker 1>But he made a deal with the guy that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not there anymore.</v>

1778
01:20:08.250 --> 01:20:11.250
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the exact details of it,</v>

1779
01:20:11.251 --> 01:20:13.350
<v Speaker 1>but it was the only time ever where his </v>
<v Speaker 1>name was on the marquee.</v>

1780
01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:18.350
<v Speaker 1>He never let them put his name on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>marquee names on the marquee and he was </v>

1781
01:20:18.350 --> 01:20:18.350
<v Speaker 1>headlining the whole weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1782
01:20:18.350 --> 01:20:21.080
<v Speaker 1>So it was like this big thing that I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>gone and he was headlining,</v>

1783
01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:25.260
<v Speaker 1>put his name on the Marquee and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forgot my point.</v>

1784
01:20:25.780 --> 01:20:30.780
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a pointless beaten into the ground </v>

1785
01:20:30.780 --> 01:20:34.010
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the bottom line was after all the </v>

1786
01:20:34.010 --> 01:20:37.680
<v Speaker 1>dust settled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody sort of eventually got a sense</v>

1787
01:20:37.681 --> 01:20:42.681
<v Speaker 1>of what it really was all about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really all about is all these </v>

1788
01:20:42.681 --> 01:20:45.261
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some have a similar story and we're all </v>

1789
01:20:45.261 --> 01:20:45.261
<v Speaker 1>dealing with something that is just </v>
<v Speaker 1>undeniable.</v>

1790
01:20:45.420 --> 01:20:46.800
<v Speaker 1>Is that door open back there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie?</v>

1791
01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:49.710
<v Speaker 1>See if that fucking doors up because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that shit is super loud.</v>

1792
01:20:50.970 --> 01:20:55.970
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need to figure out a way to like </v>

1793
01:20:55.970 --> 01:20:58.190
<v Speaker 1>soundproof the ceiling because when they</v>
<v Speaker 1>those guys are banging shit over there </v>

1794
01:20:58.770 --> 01:20:59.340
<v Speaker 1>banging shit.</v>

1795
01:20:59.460 --> 01:21:04.460
<v Speaker 1>Not like that kind of bang.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was at a hotel and I heard someone </v>

1796
01:21:04.460 --> 01:21:06.490
<v Speaker 1>fucker did happen in a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in a hotel.</v>

1797
01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:11.520
<v Speaker 1>I was 18.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in a hotel room with my parents </v>

1798
01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:11.880
<v Speaker 1>and the people next door were fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We beat each other.</v>

1799
01:21:12.040 --> 01:21:13.440
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not at all.</v>

<v Speaker 1>in the same room with my parents and </v>

<v Speaker 1>Everyone.</v>

1803
01:21:20.460 --> 01:21:22.800
<v Speaker 1>We wanted the elephant in the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>room,</v>

1804
01:21:23.010 --> 01:21:24.960
<v Speaker 1>like good white people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

<v Speaker 1>She's been rattled.</v>

1808

1817
01:21:55.180 --> 01:21:57.431
<v Speaker 1>stay in this creaky ass fucking hotel </v>
<v Speaker 1>where when someone flushes their toilet </v>

1818
01:21:57.431 --> 01:22:02.050
<v Speaker 1>three floors above you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a roaring train is running </v>

1819
01:22:02.050 --> 01:22:05.291
<v Speaker 1>through your room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time someone walked above me or </v>

01:22:12.530 --> 01:22:12.530
<v Speaker 3>more expensive than like some of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>newer hotels.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you can smell it.</v>

1830
01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:34.870
<v Speaker 3>That's how bad the hotels where there </v>
<v Speaker 3>was this place in Arizona,</v>

1831
01:22:34.871 --> 01:22:37.420
<v Speaker 3>we stayed at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The bottom of the door had like a good,</v>

1832
01:22:37.421 --> 01:22:42.421
<v Speaker 3>like three inches underneath it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you would just be in bed and you </v>

1833
01:22:42.421 --> 01:22:44.050
<v Speaker 3>would see people walking down the </v>
<v Speaker 3>hallway.</v>

1834
01:22:44.920 --> 01:22:45.540
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1835
01:22:46.040 --> 01:22:47.840
<v Speaker 1>that's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1836
01:22:47.841 --> 01:22:50.330
<v Speaker 1>but that's part of the fun of the road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially,</v>

1837
01:22:50.630 --> 01:22:53.600
<v Speaker 1>you know when you're with friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The early days especially,</v>

1838
01:22:54.020 --> 01:22:56.900
<v Speaker 1>I stayed once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a Gig on this fucking island,</v>

1839
01:22:57.080 --> 01:22:59.720
<v Speaker 1>block island,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an island outside of Rhode Island.</v>

1840
01:22:59.750 --> 01:23:02.320
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a black guy on a blog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

1841
01:23:02.340 --> 01:23:07.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the people that lived there were </v>

1842
01:23:07.340 --> 01:23:10.860
<v Speaker 1>the drunkest troglodytes I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>performed in front of ever.</v>

1843
01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:12.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy,</v>

1844
01:23:12.221 --> 01:23:17.221
<v Speaker 1>Scott Scott was the guy who booked it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was the opening act and he went </v>

1845
01:23:17.221 --> 01:23:20.281
<v Speaker 1>up and just ate a plate of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just no one was getting anything </v>

1846
01:23:20.281 --> 01:23:21.550
<v Speaker 1>out of this crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We both sucked at the time,</v>

1847
01:23:21.970 --> 01:23:26.970
<v Speaker 1>but I mean it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Gig was impossible because no one </v>

1848
01:23:26.970 --> 01:23:27.450
<v Speaker 1>was getting through this alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

1849
01:23:27.460 --> 01:23:30.850
<v Speaker 1>there was maybe 30 people in the room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like they had a bar and then they</v>

1850
01:23:30.851 --> 01:23:32.560
<v Speaker 1>just announced the show was going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

1851
01:23:32.710 --> 01:23:35.410
<v Speaker 1>It was the first one ever first and only</v>
<v Speaker 1>one it was me and him.</v>

1852
01:23:36.010 --> 01:23:37.900
<v Speaker 1>So we did the Gig gigs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>death,</v>

1853
01:23:37.901 --> 01:23:42.901
<v Speaker 1>just hot death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't want to pay us because it </v>

1854
01:23:42.901 --> 01:23:42.901
<v Speaker 1>was awful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said,</v>

1855
01:23:42.901 --> 01:23:43.450
<v Speaker 1>we've salted the people that were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that came there.</v>

1856
01:23:43.540 --> 01:23:45.500
<v Speaker 1>There wasn't a yelling shit the moment </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>

1857
01:23:47.900 --> 01:23:49.620
<v Speaker 1>It was just monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were,</v>

1858
01:23:49.650 --> 01:23:53.710
<v Speaker 1>there were pirates and then we had to </v>
<v Speaker 1>stay in a supply room.</v>

1859
01:23:53.890 --> 01:23:58.890
<v Speaker 1>We had cots that they had set up in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>room with stacks of like canned tomatoes</v>

1860
01:23:59.111 --> 01:24:00.320
<v Speaker 1>and fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1861
01:24:00.550 --> 01:24:05.550
<v Speaker 1>Syrup for soda machines and Shit and </v>
<v Speaker 1>containers of nitrous oxide,</v>

1862
01:24:05.651 --> 01:24:10.651
<v Speaker 1>that kind of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like a storage room and they put </v>

1863
01:24:10.651 --> 01:24:10.651
<v Speaker 1>two cots there with no bathroom and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where we slept.</v>

1864
01:24:11.210 --> 01:24:13.840
<v Speaker 1>Shakey's they said they had a room for </v>
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>

1865
01:24:13.841 --> 01:24:14.770
<v Speaker 1>Where's the room?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1866
01:24:14.810 --> 01:24:18.810
<v Speaker 1>we take it back here and they brought us</v>
<v Speaker 1>to this room and it was a storage room.</v>

1867
01:24:18.830 --> 01:24:22.660
<v Speaker 1>They put a cotton you could sleep here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fairy comes at six in the morning.</v>

1868
01:24:22.810 --> 01:24:25.960
<v Speaker 1>So we had to sleep there and then we had</v>
<v Speaker 1>to leave on the ferry at 6:00</v>

1869
01:24:25.961 --> 01:24:26.710
<v Speaker 1>in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

1870
01:24:26.740 --> 01:24:28.010
<v Speaker 1>Time was fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1871
01:24:28.060 --> 01:24:31.320
<v Speaker 1>it was gross.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the dude I was with was partying.</v>

1872
01:24:31.340 --> 01:24:34.630
<v Speaker 1>So he was a disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just,</v>

1873
01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:37.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you wanted to get drunk and do coke,</v>

1874
01:24:37.271 --> 01:24:38.540
<v Speaker 1>it was there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1875
01:24:38.590 --> 01:24:40.900
<v Speaker 1>It was just everybody was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no cops here.</v>

1876
01:24:42.070 --> 01:24:43.830
<v Speaker 1>The cops are coming this fucking crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>island.</v>

1877
01:24:44.690 --> 01:24:49.690
<v Speaker 1>There's only 100 people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone is like one drink away from </v>

1878
01:24:49.690 --> 01:24:51.610
<v Speaker 1>death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just barely hanging on.</v>

1879
01:24:51.640 --> 01:24:56.640
<v Speaker 1>You might as well stay up until six.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could hear their liver like pop </v>

1880
01:24:56.640 --> 01:24:59.920
<v Speaker 1>rocks going off under their skin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're shouting so much liver.</v>

1881
01:24:59.930 --> 01:25:02.530
<v Speaker 1>It's just fucking struggling to stay </v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

1882
01:25:04.570 --> 01:25:06.400
<v Speaker 1>Like the Millennium Falcon when it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>shaking,</v>

1883
01:25:06.401 --> 01:25:10.710
<v Speaker 1>trying to achieve the warp speed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the liver.</v>

1884
01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:17.640
<v Speaker 1>I'll just never forget.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was this table of like three or </v>

1885
01:25:17.640 --> 01:25:20.281
<v Speaker 1>four people together talk and and Scott </v>
<v Speaker 1>starts to show when he starts to show </v>

<v Speaker 1>the fucking cold wind and the sea water.</v>

1889
01:25:36.290 --> 01:25:39.160
<v Speaker 1>It's death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was one of those places you could not</v>

1890
01:25:39.161 --> 01:25:44.161
<v Speaker 1>live if you lived.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody would just slowly start </v>

<v Speaker 1>disappearing and horrible accidents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1892
01:25:44.420 --> 01:25:45.910

<v Speaker 1>but if you're in a bad neighborhood,</v>

1904
01:26:18.250 --> 01:26:19.790
<v Speaker 1>that's why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1905
01:26:19.890 --> 01:26:22.760
<v Speaker 1>Like anybody thinks kids should pull </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves up by their bootstraps.</v>

1906
01:26:22.850 --> 01:26:27.850
<v Speaker 1>It's tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine being born and fucking watts </v>

1907
01:26:27.850 --> 01:26:29.180
<v Speaker 1>living in the worst sections of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Inglewood or or you know,</v>

1908
01:26:29.181 --> 01:26:33.080
<v Speaker 1>being a Gypsy Caravan family and fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>England.</v>

1909
01:26:33.230 --> 01:26:35.810
<v Speaker 1>You might not even know someone that </v>
<v Speaker 1>could teach you how to do it.</v>

1910
01:26:35.900 --> 01:26:39.500
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot about examples all </v>
<v Speaker 1>over the place of what to do and like we</v>

1911
01:26:39.501 --> 01:26:41.750
<v Speaker 1>were talking about with Michael Irvin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like kids,</v>

1912
01:26:42.020 --> 01:26:45.350
<v Speaker 1>everyone's programmed differently so it </v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes like this repeating cycle.</v>

1913
01:26:45.830 --> 01:26:49.730
<v Speaker 1>Unless you get out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you are a performer or athlete or</v>

1914
01:26:49.731 --> 01:26:54.731
<v Speaker 1>someone who figures out a way to start a</v>
<v Speaker 1>business and get out of the get out of </v>

1915
01:26:54.731 --> 01:26:55.340
<v Speaker 1>the neighborhood and sort of reset </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself and figure out what the foot.</v>

1916
01:26:55.341 --> 01:26:59.090
<v Speaker 1>What kind of fucking trial was I on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What kind of path was I riding on?</v>

1917
01:27:00.650 --> 01:27:02.960
<v Speaker 1>It must be weird to mix with the rich </v>
<v Speaker 1>after that.</v>

1918
01:27:03.690 --> 01:27:04.850
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what's the weirdest shit?</v>

1919
01:27:05.450 --> 01:27:07.580
<v Speaker 1>You could just drive to Beverley hills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1920
01:27:07.581 --> 01:27:09.830
<v Speaker 1>it's right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't take long to get there.</v>

1921
01:27:09.890 --> 01:27:14.890
<v Speaker 1>So you could live in the worst </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood in La and just close your </v>

1922
01:27:14.890 --> 01:27:14.890
<v Speaker 1>door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Start Your car,</v>

1923
01:27:14.890 --> 01:27:19.720
<v Speaker 1>start driving in 15 minutes later you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>standing in front of a house that's </v>

1924
01:27:19.720 --> 01:27:20.310
<v Speaker 1>worth $50 million.</v>

1925
01:27:22.790 --> 01:27:24.320
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's weird.</v>

1926
01:27:24.380 --> 01:27:27.310
<v Speaker 1>It is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that we are.</v>

1927
01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:32.320
<v Speaker 1>And then how about this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The person who lives in Compton or </v>

1928
01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:35.320
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit neighborhood they could get in </v>

1929
01:27:35.320 --> 01:27:35.320
<v Speaker 1>their car and drive to Tijuana and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:37.460
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought I had it.</v>

1931
01:27:37.850 --> 01:27:39.760
<v Speaker 1>Let's get back to compton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm worried.</v>

1932
01:27:39.780 --> 01:27:41.750
<v Speaker 1>Get away from this cardboard house with </v>
<v Speaker 1>no windows.</v>

1933
01:27:42.140 --> 01:27:44.660
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are we allowed to make fun of Gypsies?</v>

1934
01:27:44.661 --> 01:27:47.630
<v Speaker 1>Like is there any kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Except for gypsy.</v>

1935
01:27:47.631 --> 01:27:48.950
<v Speaker 1>That's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not true.</v>

1936
01:27:48.980 --> 01:27:51.110
<v Speaker 1>There's some feedback.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some blow back in England.</v>

<v Speaker 1>If you start shitting on Gypsies in </v>

1938
01:27:56.300 --> 01:27:56.300
<v Speaker 1>other countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get very upset.</v>

1939
01:27:56.300 --> 01:27:57.880
<v Speaker 1>Can we still call them Gypsies?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rogatory yet?</v>

1940
01:27:58.280 --> 01:28:00.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's derogatory.</v>

1941
01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:01.880
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's look it up.</v>

1942
01:28:02.150 --> 01:28:06.470
<v Speaker 1>Someone is offended.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of Gypsies in Burbank and they,</v>

1943
01:28:06.471 --> 01:28:11.471
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're always hanging out in my </v>

1944
01:28:11.471 --> 01:28:11.471
<v Speaker 1>dumpster there.</v>

1945
01:28:11.471 --> 01:28:11.471
<v Speaker 1>American Gypsy hanging out in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>dumpster.</v>

1946
01:28:11.480 --> 01:28:16.480
<v Speaker 1>They pull up in these weird vans that </v>
<v Speaker 1>have beads all over on me just like all </v>

1947
01:28:16.480 --> 01:28:20.471
<v Speaker 1>come out of this van and they all just </v>
<v Speaker 1>start going through all the trash and </v>

1948
01:28:20.471 --> 01:28:21.200
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of bands in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood recently,</v>

1949
01:28:21.201 --> 01:28:24.950
<v Speaker 1>like people just live on my street now </v>
<v Speaker 1>in advance.</v>

1950
01:28:24.980 --> 01:28:26.060
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ready?</v>

1951
01:28:26.630 --> 01:28:27.890
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's racist.</v>

1952
01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:32.560
<v Speaker 1>A racial slur.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was a surprise.</v>

1953
01:28:32.570 --> 01:28:37.570
<v Speaker 1>The end where it wasn't in the retort </v>
<v Speaker 1>article on Gawker about a child that was</v>

1954
01:28:38.241 --> 01:28:42.770
<v Speaker 1>taken away from a couple because she </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't look like them and it says police</v>

1955
01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:43.910
<v Speaker 1>rescue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mystery,</v>

1956
01:28:43.911 --> 01:28:48.911
<v Speaker 1>blonde child from Gypsy couple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then this article goes on to </v>

1957
01:28:48.911 --> 01:28:52.970
<v Speaker 1>describe that it says the term Gypsies </v>
<v Speaker 1>and non preferred and often derogatory </v>

1958
01:28:52.970 --> 01:28:56.000
<v Speaker 1>term for Roma people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For those of you who aren't aware of the</v>

1959
01:28:56.060 --> 01:29:01.060
<v Speaker 1>Anti Roma Bigotry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Roma are an indigenous people of </v>

1960
01:29:01.060 --> 01:29:03.420
<v Speaker 1>Europe who continued to be pushed from </v>
<v Speaker 1>nation to nation and mistreated.</v>

1961
01:29:03.750 --> 01:29:08.750
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one take on it by a friend who </v>

1962
01:29:08.750 --> 01:29:12.711
<v Speaker 1>lived outside of London who had these </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gypsies move into the lot near their </v>

1963
01:29:12.711 --> 01:29:14.430
<v Speaker 1>friend's house and absolutely destroy </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1964
01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:17.250
<v Speaker 1>destroy the neighborhood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leave their trash everywhere.</v>

1965
01:29:17.251 --> 01:29:22.251
<v Speaker 1>Rob,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the houses in the neighborhood like </v>

1966
01:29:22.251 --> 01:29:23.640
<v Speaker 1>there are also notorious criminals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>notorious,</v>

1967
01:29:23.740 --> 01:29:24.750
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's no.</v>

1968
01:29:24.850 --> 01:29:27.060
<v Speaker 1>They're not all criminals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of them.</v>

1969
01:29:27.090 --> 01:29:29.850
<v Speaker 1>They live a crazy lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're always bare knuckle fighting.</v>

1970
01:29:30.030 --> 01:29:32.130
<v Speaker 1>They have these videos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they challenge each other online.</v>

1971
01:29:32.150 --> 01:29:37.150
<v Speaker 1>It's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Various beautiful slice of our human </v>

1972
01:29:37.150 --> 01:29:41.691
<v Speaker 1>culture in 2012,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to this portrayal of it is so </v>

1973
01:29:41.691 --> 01:29:43.570
<v Speaker 1>ridiculously one side of him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1974
01:29:43.950 --> 01:29:47.150
<v Speaker 1>They are pushed from nation to nation </v>
<v Speaker 1>and mistreated.</v>

1975
01:29:47.340 --> 01:29:48.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

1976
01:29:48.061 --> 01:29:53.061
<v Speaker 1>We don't want you leaving your garbage </v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere and fighting in the streets </v>

1977
01:29:53.061 --> 01:29:53.061
<v Speaker 1>and stabbing my friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1978
01:29:53.130 --> 01:29:55.350
<v Speaker 1>please don't do that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or whatever you been doing.</v>

1979
01:29:55.690 --> 01:30:00.690
<v Speaker 1>Say stabbing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they're involved in </v>

1980
01:30:00.690 --> 01:30:02.631
<v Speaker 1>stabbing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's part of the game is we got a </v>

1981
01:30:02.631 --> 01:30:02.631
<v Speaker 1>row of town to town and we got to hustle</v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

1982
01:30:02.631 --> 01:30:02.850
<v Speaker 1>They're wild people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1983
01:30:02.940 --> 01:30:03.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fascinating.</v>

1984
01:30:03.961 --> 01:30:05.650
<v Speaker 1>The movie snatch was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1985
01:30:05.651 --> 01:30:06.050
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1986
01:30:06.051 --> 01:30:07.260
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're actually moving on it.</v>

1987
01:30:07.320 --> 01:30:10.770
<v Speaker 1>Fucking awesome with the way Brad Pitt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that whole dialect,</v>

1988
01:30:11.100 --> 01:30:13.770
<v Speaker 1>so fucking awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The article goes on.</v>

1989
01:30:13.910 --> 01:30:18.600
<v Speaker 1>They are frequently denied legal status </v>
<v Speaker 1>and therefore social services.</v>

1990
01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:20.910
<v Speaker 1>There are many stereotypes about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Roma,</v>

1991
01:30:21.060 --> 01:30:24.150
<v Speaker 1>but the most predominant is that they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>all sociopathic.</v>

1992
01:30:24.151 --> 01:30:29.151
<v Speaker 1>Drifters who steal children and anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>else that isn't tied down well.</v>

1993
01:30:29.990 --> 01:30:34.990
<v Speaker 1>It's been my experience that very few </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who do nothing wrong or labeled </v>

1994
01:30:34.990 --> 01:30:36.840
<v Speaker 1>as sociopathic thieves who steal </v>
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>

1995
01:30:37.320 --> 01:30:42.320
<v Speaker 1>Very few people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that they don't say </v>

1996
01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:44.721
<v Speaker 1>about those Tibetan Buddhist monks is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's sociopathic thieves who </v>

1997
01:30:44.721 --> 01:30:44.721
<v Speaker 1>steal children.</v>

1998
01:30:44.721 --> 01:30:49.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said that about a mother theresa a </v>

1999
01:30:49.400 --> 01:30:49.400
<v Speaker 1>lot to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

2000
01:30:49.400 --> 01:30:49.830
<v Speaker 1>and all the stationary I think feeds who</v>
<v Speaker 1>steal children.</v>

2001
01:30:49.860 --> 01:30:54.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know man ejaculates in people's </v>

2002
01:30:54.860 --> 01:30:59.331
<v Speaker 1>coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not healthy to paint things in a </v>

2003
01:30:59.331 --> 01:31:02.301
<v Speaker 1>completely unrealistic biased way like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy is doing just to prove that </v>

2004
01:31:02.301 --> 01:31:03.080
<v Speaker 1>you're not racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2005
01:31:03.150 --> 01:31:04.530
<v Speaker 1>That shit's not healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

2006
01:31:04.531 --> 01:31:07.530
<v Speaker 1>I know you should talk about the reality</v>
<v Speaker 1>of their life.</v>

2007
01:31:07.770 --> 01:31:11.880
<v Speaker 1>Like it doesn't help anybody if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit people on what these folks do.</v>

2008
01:31:11.940 --> 01:31:13.470
<v Speaker 1>Right in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

2009
01:31:13.471 --> 01:31:18.471
<v Speaker 1>it's not all of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the fact that you're saying that </v>

2010
01:31:18.471 --> 01:31:18.960
<v Speaker 1>Gypsy's haven't been involved in </v>
<v Speaker 1>conflicts or the Roma people,</v>

2011
01:31:18.961 --> 01:31:21.450
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck you want to call them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be lying.</v>

2012
01:31:21.540 --> 01:31:22.250
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2013
01:31:22.260 --> 01:31:27.120
<v Speaker 1>When we could all come up with different</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons for why cultural biological,</v>

2014
01:31:27.121 --> 01:31:32.121
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's all sorts of variables that are </v>

2015
01:31:32.121 --> 01:31:32.121
<v Speaker 1>entering into this equation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to portray it like this,</v>

2016
01:31:32.121 --> 01:31:36.771
<v Speaker 1>like these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these beautiful people that are just </v>

2017
01:31:36.771 --> 01:31:38.481
<v Speaker 1>roaming from town to town and everyone's</v>
<v Speaker 1>just pushing them away because of the </v>

2018
01:31:38.481 --> 01:31:41.340
<v Speaker 1>patriarchy because white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>white people privileged.</v>

01:32:18.790 --> 01:32:23.790
<v Speaker 1>What's going on in this world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something strange going on in </v>

2038
01:32:23.790 --> 01:32:23.790
<v Speaker 1>this world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2039
01:32:23.790 --> 01:32:24.190
<v Speaker 1>Just something strange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2040
01:32:24.220 --> 01:32:28.060
<v Speaker 1>this article is proof of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are going way out of their way to</v>

2041
01:32:28.061 --> 01:32:33.061
<v Speaker 1>show that they're sensitive and open </v>
<v Speaker 1>minded to the point where they're not </v>

2042
01:32:33.061 --> 01:32:33.061
<v Speaker 1>really open minded.</v>

2043
01:32:33.061 --> 01:32:33.330
<v Speaker 1>You're denying reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2044
01:32:33.340 --> 01:32:38.340
<v Speaker 1>It's like it doesn't help anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't help anybody to only only </v>

2045
01:32:38.651 --> 01:32:43.651
<v Speaker 1>side with the maligned and mistreated in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the misrepresented to always side with </v>

2046
01:32:43.651 --> 01:32:44.030
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2047
01:32:44.160 --> 01:32:45.880
<v Speaker 1>That's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not healthy.</v>

2048
01:32:46.500 --> 01:32:50.050
<v Speaker 1>Like marginalized people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's marginalized groups for sure and</v>

2049
01:32:50.051 --> 01:32:53.170
<v Speaker 1>it's good to recognize when they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>being mistreated,</v>

2050
01:32:53.230 --> 01:32:56.080
<v Speaker 1>but the reality of their behavior can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>be ignored.</v>

2051
01:32:56.290 --> 01:32:57.450
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2052
01:32:57.620 --> 01:32:59.350
<v Speaker 1>It muddies up the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2053
01:32:59.380 --> 01:33:04.380
<v Speaker 1>You can still sign with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to admit the facts and you </v>

2054
01:33:04.380 --> 01:33:07.531
<v Speaker 1>have to admit that they survive ways </v>
<v Speaker 1>that can hurt other civilians.</v>

2055
01:33:09.251 --> 01:33:10.130
<v Speaker 1>Other people.</v>

<v Speaker 1>thrust into.</v>

2058
01:33:15.340 --> 01:33:16.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you were there,</v>

2059
01:33:16.601 --> 01:33:17.160
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2060
01:33:17.170 --> 01:33:21.360
<v Speaker 1>I watched this video on poachers in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Africa and all these people that like,</v>

2061
01:33:21.730 --> 01:33:22.360
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2062
01:33:22.361 --> 01:33:25.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they illegally capture these animals and</v>

2063
01:33:25.781 --> 01:33:28.510
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it's the only food that these </v>
<v Speaker 1>people can get,</v>

2064
01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:31.420
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they're in terrible situations.</v>

2065
01:33:31.630 --> 01:33:33.940
<v Speaker 1>They have these ridiculous guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They construct,</v>

2066
01:33:34.280 --> 01:33:37.000
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they make their own charges and light.</v>

2067
01:33:37.001 --> 01:33:40.360
<v Speaker 1>They're gone sometimes with a lighter </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then shoot it at these animals.</v>

2068
01:33:40.361 --> 01:33:42.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean they pack these things like </v>
<v Speaker 1>muskets.</v>

2069
01:33:42.491 --> 01:33:44.680
<v Speaker 1>I think a rifle and a packet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a musket and then like,</v>

2070
01:33:44.970 --> 01:33:46.120
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a fuse,</v>

2071
01:33:46.121 --> 01:33:47.050
<v Speaker 1>like it's a bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2072
01:33:47.051 --> 01:33:51.460
<v Speaker 1>it's ridiculous how poor and rudimentary</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of this shit is.</v>

2073
01:33:51.461 --> 01:33:53.260
<v Speaker 1>These guys are doing.</v>

01:34:01.740 --> 01:34:01.740
<v Speaker 1>poaching animal's needs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2078
01:34:01.740 --> 01:34:02.650
<v Speaker 1>It's terrible to shoot someone else's </v>
<v Speaker 1>property.</v>

2079
01:34:02.651 --> 01:34:04.390
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you are starving to death,</v>

2080
01:34:04.391 --> 01:34:05.530
<v Speaker 1>it seems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems wrong,</v>

2081
01:34:05.531 --> 01:34:07.540
<v Speaker 1>but moved to America and work on Wall </v>
<v Speaker 1>Street.</v>

2082
01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:10.500

<v Speaker 1>He knows it's this should.</v>

2083
01:34:10.690 --> 01:34:14.170
<v Speaker 1>Why doesn't he get an education?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>

2087
01:34:21.850 --> 01:34:26.850
<v Speaker 1>You can't judge people like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way you would judge a person from a </v>

2088
01:34:26.850 --> 01:34:27.370
<v Speaker 1>normal neighborhood with a normal </v>
<v Speaker 1>background.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You're not in that situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't seek that situation.</v>

01:34:37.230 --> 01:34:38.920
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2095
01:34:40.140 --> 01:34:45.140
<v Speaker 1>that's the real problem with the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real problem in the world is like </v>

2096
01:34:45.140 --> 01:34:48.420
<v Speaker 1>the one percent that everybody wants to </v>
<v Speaker 1>think about that if you make more than </v>

2097
01:34:48.420 --> 01:34:49.120
<v Speaker 1>$34,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year,</v>

2098
01:34:49.121 --> 01:34:51.160
<v Speaker 1>you're in the top one percent of all </v>
<v Speaker 1>people on the planet.</v>

2099
01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.160
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did not know that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>this podcast before too.</v>

2102
01:34:59.250 --> 01:34:59.570
<v Speaker 1>That's a real number.</v>

2103
01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:02.330
<v Speaker 1>That's so when you talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>poachers,</v>

2104
01:35:02.331 --> 01:35:04.130
<v Speaker 1>are you talking about impoverished </v>
<v Speaker 1>people?</v>

2105
01:35:04.520 --> 01:35:07.640
<v Speaker 1>The level of poverty that the people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>work at Foxconn have.</v>

2106
01:35:07.940 --> 01:35:08.720
<v Speaker 1>When you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2107
01:35:08.721 --> 01:35:11.210
<v Speaker 1>those people live there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nets around the building to keep</v>

2108
01:35:11.211 --> 01:35:16.211
<v Speaker 1>them jumping off the roof,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we can't even imagine what that </v>

<v Speaker 1>life is like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those are people just like,</v>

2112
01:35:20.241 --> 01:35:21.650
<v Speaker 1>if we were born in China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd be like,</v>

2113
01:35:21.651 --> 01:35:23.090
<v Speaker 1>fuck dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got to go to the Foxconn.</v>

<v Speaker 1>We can't have the option to go to the </v>

2115

<v Speaker 1>store tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what's called perform at the </v>

2116
01:35:30.161 --> 01:35:30.161
<v Speaker 1>comedy store?</v>

<v Speaker 1>We have to make cell phones for a nickel</v>

2118
01:35:30.261 --> 01:35:30.680
<v Speaker 1>an hour.</v>

2119
01:35:30.730 --> 01:35:33.980
<v Speaker 4>I got a suicide at noon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2120
01:35:34.720 --> 01:35:37.330
<v Speaker 4>how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how does that work?</v>

2121
01:35:37.331 --> 01:35:40.330
<v Speaker 4>They don't like apply for those jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do they just kind of.</v>

2122
01:35:40.630 --> 01:35:44.080
<v Speaker 4>If they can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know if there's enough jobs</v>

2123
01:35:44.081 --> 01:35:47.920
<v Speaker 4>to supply all the people that are poor </v>
<v Speaker 4>and looking for jobs there.</v>

2124
01:35:48.490 --> 01:35:50.830
<v Speaker 4>There's a billion people in China.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>

2125
01:35:50.890 --> 01:35:53.110
<v Speaker 4>A billion and they just hacked our </v>
<v Speaker 4>weather system.</v>

2126
01:35:53.111 --> 01:35:58.111
<v Speaker 4>Did you see that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're talking about the US said today </v>

2127
01:35:58.111 --> 01:36:01.141
<v Speaker 4>that China has hacked our radar and </v>
<v Speaker 4>satellite are or whether or like one of </v>

2128
01:36:01.770 --> 01:36:06.770
<v Speaker 4>our things that we use for our news </v>
<v Speaker 4>every day and they packed it or </v>

2129
01:36:06.770 --> 01:36:11.701
<v Speaker 4>satellite and that's why I pull up an </v>
<v Speaker 4>article on it so we can get a more </v>

2130
01:36:11.701 --> 01:36:12.220
<v Speaker 4>definitive description of what's going </v>
<v Speaker 4>on.</v>

2131
01:36:12.280 --> 01:36:14.170
<v Speaker 4>That's why I feel like the whole month </v>
<v Speaker 4>of October,</v>

2132
01:36:14.171 --> 01:36:19.171
<v Speaker 4>I think there was very limited radar in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the news and the consumer from China </v>

2133
01:36:19.171 --> 01:36:20.820
<v Speaker 4>hacked our radar dishes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>governments,</v>

2134
01:36:20.821 --> 01:36:23.450
<v Speaker 4>but that's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>China,</v>

2135
01:36:23.740 --> 01:36:28.480
<v Speaker 4>so the Chinese government hacked our </v>
<v Speaker 4>radar system or whether system,</v>

2136
01:36:28.481 --> 01:36:30.530
<v Speaker 4>whether it radar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are they doing with it?</v>

2137
01:36:30.550 --> 01:36:33.480
<v Speaker 4>They stealing the data.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why do they care what the temperature is</v>

2138
01:36:33.490 --> 01:36:38.490
<v Speaker 4>over here?</v>
<v Speaker 4>US weather's so much while I'm at 75 </v>

2139
01:36:40.781 --> 01:36:42.400
<v Speaker 4>degrees in Los Angeles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>

2140
01:36:42.401 --> 01:36:43.790
<v Speaker 4>terrible accidents.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Both of us,</v>

2141
01:36:43.840 --> 01:36:47.200
<v Speaker 4>both of us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know which way to go to go.</v>

2142
01:36:47.201 --> 01:36:48.760
<v Speaker 4>Super Chinese are just weird.</v>

2143
01:36:50.950 --> 01:36:52.090
<v Speaker 4>Weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you don't know what you're doing.</v>

2144
01:36:52.091 --> 01:36:54.610
<v Speaker 4>Chinese reportedly hack us weather </v>
<v Speaker 4>systems.</v>

2145
01:36:54.640 --> 01:36:59.320
<v Speaker 4>What Chinese hackers allegedly broke </v>
<v Speaker 4>into the US weather systems in September</v>

2146
01:36:59.500 --> 01:37:04.500
<v Speaker 4>and caused federal cyber security forces</v>
<v Speaker 4>to block sensitive data needed for </v>

2147
01:37:04.500 --> 01:37:08.911
<v Speaker 4>crucial uses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>including disaster planning and </v>

2148
01:37:08.911 --> 01:37:08.911
<v Speaker 4>aviation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they,</v>

2149
01:37:08.911 --> 01:37:13.330
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they fucked with like a lot more than </v>

2150
01:37:13.330 --> 01:37:13.330
<v Speaker 4>just like the weather radar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

2151
01:37:13.330 --> 01:37:14.980
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who knows who's doing that though?</v>

2152
01:37:15.180 --> 01:37:16.150
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we say China,</v>

2153
01:37:16.170 --> 01:37:21.170
<v Speaker 4>like who just is a billion people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Could be one asshole would call it </v>

2154
01:37:21.170 --> 01:37:22.220
<v Speaker 4>China.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2155
01:37:22.221 --> 01:37:24.610
<v Speaker 4>It's only like one to 10 assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who were they saying,</v>

2156
01:37:26.880 --> 01:37:28.960
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be food in China.</v>

2157
01:37:28.961 --> 01:37:30.430
<v Speaker 4>Did this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we're blaming China.</v>

2158
01:37:30.460 --> 01:37:31.450
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's go to war.</v>

2159
01:37:31.480 --> 01:37:31.950
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is this.</v>

2160
01:37:31.980 --> 01:37:36.980
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is this an official government a thing </v>

2161
01:37:36.980 --> 01:37:38.800
<v Speaker 4>that did this or looking by the way </v>
<v Speaker 4>while we're looking.</v>

2162
01:37:38.801 --> 01:37:43.801
<v Speaker 4>Did you try to sit in that chair?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You prefer better?</v>

2163
01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:46.360
<v Speaker 4>This is way better for my posture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2164
01:37:46.390 --> 01:37:49.090
<v Speaker 4>Better for my back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I knew I was going to need to lounge</v>

2165
01:37:49.091 --> 01:37:50.320
<v Speaker 4>a little bit while I was here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2166
01:37:50.330 --> 01:37:53.950
<v Speaker 4>That's your thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this is a clearly better chair,</v>

2167
01:37:54.670 --> 01:37:56.490
<v Speaker 4>but this me more relaxed.</v>

2168
01:37:57.320 --> 01:37:59.670
<v Speaker 2>I'll give up relaxation for posture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2169
01:37:59.980 --> 01:38:01.830
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm still with the Ergonomic chairs,</v>

2170

2191
01:39:02.060 --> 01:39:04.650
<v Speaker 2>It could be someone blaming the Chinese </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they are doing it.</v>

2192
01:39:05.080 --> 01:39:08.010
<v Speaker 2>Know who the fuck knows.</v>

01:40:18.450 --> 01:40:23.450
<v Speaker 2>You can throw one bitch a set in there </v>

2291
01:43:29.921 --> 01:43:31.900
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that like this already laying thing that</v>

2292
01:43:31.901 --> 01:43:34.240
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about yesterday and we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we played his,</v>

2293
01:43:34.241 --> 01:43:39.241
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we read rather his tweet the other day </v>

2294
01:43:39.241 --> 01:43:42.660
<v Speaker 2>during the Dahmer podcast and we were </v>
<v Speaker 2>shocked at what everybody was upset </v>

2295
01:43:42.791 --> 01:43:46.310
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now did he said this on the podcast,</v>

2296
01:43:46.360 --> 01:43:48.100
<v Speaker 2>is that what happened with twitter?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twitter,</v>

2297
01:43:48.340 --> 01:43:52.010
<v Speaker 2>he tweeted it as a fucking comedian </v>
<v Speaker 2>known for being</v>

2298
01:43:52.010 --> 01:43:55.490
<v Speaker 4>dirty and because he said something </v>
<v Speaker 4>about an African American woman,</v>

2299
01:43:55.491 --> 01:43:59.930
<v Speaker 4>but her whipping him and him coming all </v>
<v Speaker 4>over himself,</v>

2300
01:43:59.931 --> 01:44:01.640
<v Speaker 4>like a fat father.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just,</v>

2301
01:44:01.641 --> 01:44:04.580
<v Speaker 4>it was about her disrespecting the </v>
<v Speaker 4>plantation.</v>

2302
01:44:04.581 --> 01:44:06.050
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his tweets were hilarious,</v>

2303
01:44:06.830 --> 01:44:10.310
<v Speaker 4>but people were so offended that he was </v>
<v Speaker 4>kicked off of that midnight show.</v>

2304
01:44:10.311 --> 01:44:14.000
<v Speaker 4>He couldn't do the midnight show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then on top of that he,</v>

2305
01:44:14.001 --> 01:44:16.130
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he got banned from Espn.</v>

2306
01:44:16.131 --> 01:44:21.131
<v Speaker 4>He can't go on espn to care of ESPN.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Last night he torched espn for ripping </v>

2307
01:44:23.271 --> 01:44:24.950
<v Speaker 4>him off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He got up,</v>

2308
01:44:25.250 --> 01:44:27.400
<v Speaker 4>he got it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a phrase or a bit stolen yet.</v>

2309
01:44:27.770 --> 01:44:30.440
<v Speaker 4>And so he just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he redid a whole sketch,</v>

2310
01:44:30.441 --> 01:44:35.441
<v Speaker 4>ripping them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tasha has this thing called Web </v>

2311
01:44:35.441 --> 01:44:35.441
<v Speaker 4>redemption,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2312
01:44:35.441 --> 01:44:35.441
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where he's,</v>

2313
01:44:35.441 --> 01:44:36.180
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he watches like famous,</v>

2314
01:44:36.181 --> 01:44:37.870
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like videos and just,</v>

2315
01:44:38.030 --> 01:44:38.420
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

2316
01:44:38.460 --> 01:44:43.460
<v Speaker 4>let's get redemption for this lien.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so he meets the people there in the </v>

2317
01:44:43.460 --> 01:44:43.460
<v Speaker 4>veil.</v>

2318
01:44:43.460 --> 01:44:44.450
<v Speaker 4>They pretty much exactly did the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

2319
01:44:44.510 --> 01:44:47.960
<v Speaker 4>And so she's been on there since like </v>
<v Speaker 4>six years or something.</v>

2320
01:44:48.380 --> 01:44:53.380
<v Speaker 4>So they're doing the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're just calling it a different </v>

2321
01:44:53.380 --> 01:44:53.380
<v Speaker 4>name.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't play it,</v>

2322
01:44:53.380 --> 01:44:56.180
<v Speaker 4>don't play it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'll get us kicked off of youtube every</v>

2323

<v Speaker 4>time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every fucking time.</v>

2324
01:44:58.041 --> 01:45:00.860
<v Speaker 4>Even though I've got a comedy central </v>
<v Speaker 4>special coming out next week,</v>

2492
01:51:41.910 --> 01:51:41.980
<v Speaker 2>ivory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just,</v>

2494
01:51:44.321 --> 01:51:46.680
<v Speaker 2>and storm into villages and stomp </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything down,</v>

2495
01:51:46.700 --> 01:51:49.690
<v Speaker 2>but look,</v>

01:51:52.421 --> 01:51:57.421
<v Speaker 2>how they used to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They electrocuted an elephant as an </v>

2498
01:51:57.421 --> 01:51:57.610
<v Speaker 2>experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You can just,</v>

2501
01:52:04.990 --> 01:52:07.780
<v Speaker 2>you can cook an elephant and Times </v>
<v Speaker 2>Square and nobody gives a shit.</v>

2502
01:52:07.780 --> 01:52:12.780
<v Speaker 2>Back then it was for a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that video is the advancement that </v>

2503
01:52:12.780 --> 01:52:13.500
<v Speaker 2>video gets pulled,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if we do like a screenshot,</v>

2504
01:52:13.570 --> 01:52:14.730
<v Speaker 2>it really goes both ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2509
01:52:26.081 --> 01:52:31.081
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's worth watching because it feels </v>

2510
01:52:31.081 --> 01:52:32.581
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A young elephant fights 14 lines and </v>

2511
01:52:32.581 --> 01:52:32.581
<v Speaker 2>wins,</v>

<v Speaker 2>if you shot one of those lines,</v>

2513
01:52:33.011 --> 01:52:37.330
<v Speaker 2>everybody was super mad at you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he was sitting there watching,</v>

2514
01:52:37.331 --> 01:52:38.590
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine this is what happens.</v>

2515
01:52:38.720 --> 01:52:43.720
<v Speaker 2>You're sitting there watching this </v>
<v Speaker 2>elephant getting fucked up by these </v>

2516
01:52:43.720 --> 01:52:46.291
<v Speaker 2>lines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you just fucking pull out of your </v>

2517
01:52:46.291 --> 01:52:46.291
<v Speaker 2>four by four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>climb up on the roof,</v>

2518
01:52:46.760 --> 01:52:51.050
<v Speaker 1>line this motherfucker up and you see </v>
<v Speaker 1>this lion's body.</v>

2519
01:52:52.310 --> 01:52:54.740
<v Speaker 1>You'd be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People would be really pissed at you,</v>

2520
01:52:54.840 --> 01:52:57.850
<v Speaker 1>dear Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe they shot that line,</v>

2521
01:52:57.890 --> 01:52:59.440
<v Speaker 1>but if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2522
01:52:59.441 --> 01:53:03.980
<v Speaker 1>if you'll just sit back and let the </v>
<v Speaker 1>lions killed the elephant to do you pick</v>

2523
01:53:03.981 --> 01:53:06.260
<v Speaker 1>a side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you pick a side when you see 14 lines</v>

2524
01:53:06.261 --> 01:53:08.300
<v Speaker 1>trying to kill an elephant?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Elephant.</v>

2525
01:53:08.330 --> 01:53:10.190
<v Speaker 1>You've picked us out to the alpha.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so too,</v>

2526
01:53:10.250 --> 01:53:13.400
<v Speaker 1>because elephants are herbivores.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not predators.</v>

2527
01:53:13.460 --> 01:53:15.590
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But isn't that just how it works,</v>

2528
01:53:15.620 --> 01:53:18.050
<v Speaker 1>man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the lions can bring down the elephant</v>

2529
01:53:18.060 --> 01:53:19.160
<v Speaker 1>to eat it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how it works.</v>

2530
01:53:19.310 --> 01:53:22.100
<v Speaker 1>That's the game plan is not the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're all playing.</v>

2531
01:53:22.190 --> 01:53:23.410
<v Speaker 1>That is the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all planning.</v>

2532
01:53:23.440 --> 01:53:28.440
<v Speaker 1>Like if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's a person like some chick on </v>

2533
01:53:28.440 --> 01:53:29.210
<v Speaker 1>facebook posing with a deadline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's the cont.</v>

2534
01:53:29.430 --> 01:53:30.170
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2535
01:53:30.440 --> 01:53:32.670
<v Speaker 1>But if the lions take this elephant out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

2536
01:53:32.690 --> 01:53:35.720
<v Speaker 1>like the lion had to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chick took a flight over here.</v>

2537
01:53:35.840 --> 01:53:37.760
<v Speaker 1>She's an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's just doing this for fun,</v>

2538
01:53:38.300 --> 01:53:43.300
<v Speaker 1>just like a homo gypsy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if the chick was there and she was </v>

2539
01:53:43.300 --> 01:53:44.180
<v Speaker 1>doing it for fun and she saw this and </v>
<v Speaker 1>she said,</v>

2540
01:53:44.181 --> 01:53:45.200
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck these lines.</v>

2541
01:53:45.201 --> 01:53:46.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kill one of those lines.</v>

2542
01:53:46.550 --> 01:53:48.950
<v Speaker 1>Would people be angry at her?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they probably.</v>

2543
01:53:48.951 --> 01:53:50.390
<v Speaker 1>Would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People pick teams?</v>

2544
01:53:50.510 --> 01:53:51.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even when it comes to animals.</v>

2545
01:53:52.200 --> 01:53:53.930
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a little weird.</v>

2546
01:53:53.960 --> 01:53:58.960
<v Speaker 1>I love lions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I just know elephants are way </v>

2547
01:53:58.960 --> 01:53:58.960
<v Speaker 1>fucking smarter than A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2548
01:53:58.960 --> 01:54:00.290
<v Speaker 1>They can paint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can paint their face.</v>

2549
01:54:01.470 --> 01:54:02.410
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2550
01:54:02.411 --> 01:54:02.900
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2551
01:54:02.960 --> 01:54:05.210
<v Speaker 1>That'll get us pulled too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's a video.</v>

2552
01:54:05.211 --> 01:54:10.211
<v Speaker 1>If you go and Google it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a video of an elephant painting </v>

2553
01:54:10.211 --> 01:54:11.930
<v Speaker 1>his own portrait or her own portrait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a,</v>

2554
01:54:12.090 --> 01:54:13.880
<v Speaker 1>there's only the males have the horns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is?</v>

2555
01:54:13.910 --> 01:54:17.330
<v Speaker 1>The tusks?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't know about that.</v>

2556
01:54:17.720 --> 01:54:22.720
<v Speaker 1>Would they use only.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the only antlered animal that's a </v>

2557
01:54:22.720 --> 01:54:24.230
<v Speaker 1>female.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2558
01:54:24.750 --> 01:54:28.430
<v Speaker 1>as far as like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like deer and elk and Caribou.</v>

2559
01:54:28.580 --> 01:54:31.070
<v Speaker 1>Female Caribou.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have Antlers coming out of the fight off</v>

2560
01:54:31.071 --> 01:54:35.000
<v Speaker 1>wolves and shit to female elephants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about female rams?</v>

2561
01:54:35.300 --> 01:54:36.920
<v Speaker 1>Female Rams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>GotTa have horns,</v>

2562

<v Speaker 1>It's a sheep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Females,</v>

2564
01:54:44.990 --> 01:54:49.990
<v Speaker 1>sheep rams just swayed on fuck ramps </v>
<v Speaker 1>growing up.</v>

2565
01:54:53.780 --> 01:54:57.850
<v Speaker 1>Both male and female.</v>
<v Speaker 1>African elephants have tusks unlocked or</v>

2566
01:54:57.860 --> 01:55:02.430
<v Speaker 1>Asian relatives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um.</v>

2567
01:55:02.900 --> 01:55:04.790
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not like their ancient relatives.</v>

2568
01:55:04.791 --> 01:55:08.270
<v Speaker 1>African elephants are not easily </v>
<v Speaker 1>domesticated in incorrect sentence.</v>

2569
01:55:08.271 --> 01:55:10.910
<v Speaker 1>I only had to click on it here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

2570
01:55:10.940 --> 01:55:13.880
<v Speaker 1>they both have tusks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys hear about these cat dicks.</v>

2571
01:55:14.010 --> 01:55:15.970
<v Speaker 1>They have little knives in them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all have good nights.</v>

2572
01:55:15.980 --> 01:55:20.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They stick in like a bb fishing the </v>

2573
01:55:20.980 --> 01:55:22.250
<v Speaker 1>fishing for pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get cat calls.</v>

2574
01:55:22.310 --> 01:55:25.420
<v Speaker 1>You ever heard cat cat screaming every </v>
<v Speaker 1>night?</v>

2575
01:55:25.430 --> 01:55:26.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like they're fighting.</v>

2576
01:55:26.570 --> 01:55:31.570
<v Speaker 1>You hear it night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a lot of feral cat in my </v>

2577
01:55:31.570 --> 01:55:31.570
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did Gypsies brought on.</v>

2578
01:55:31.740 --> 01:55:36.740
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you live in a neighborhood where </v>

2579
01:55:36.740 --> 01:55:36.740
<v Speaker 1>people just let their cats out and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>they.</v>

2580
01:55:36.740 --> 01:55:39.380
<v Speaker 1>They like people like let their cats </v>
<v Speaker 1>free.</v>

2581
01:55:39.380 --> 01:55:44.380
<v Speaker 1>Especially male cats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people don't want to get their </v>

2582
01:55:44.380 --> 01:55:44.380
<v Speaker 1>mail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cats fixed.</v>

2583
01:55:44.380 --> 01:55:47.861
<v Speaker 1>It's paying the asset of the money and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so just let the little cute ball you </v>

2584
01:55:47.861 --> 01:55:50.991
<v Speaker 1>want to look at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird because you could tell that </v>

2585
01:55:50.991 --> 01:55:51.210
<v Speaker 1>there was a couple of the cats that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>just like they don't have homes,</v>

2586
01:55:51.300 --> 01:55:54.510
<v Speaker 1>but then there's cats because I live in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a nicer neighborhood that are mixed with</v>

2587
01:55:54.511 --> 01:55:56.520
<v Speaker 1>like Persian cats that have callers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

2588
01:55:56.690 --> 01:56:01.690
<v Speaker 1>it's a gangs of cats though and at night</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just fucking hanging out on your </v>

2589
01:56:01.690 --> 01:56:05.091
<v Speaker 1>car where you rarely see a cat with his </v>
<v Speaker 1>balls and really see a male cat with </v>

2590
01:56:05.401 --> 01:56:07.200
<v Speaker 1>balls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you go over people's houses,</v>

2591
01:56:07.320 --> 01:56:12.320
<v Speaker 1>their cats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their male cats are always neutered </v>

2592
01:56:12.320 --> 01:56:12.320
<v Speaker 1>because if you're your male cat is </v>
<v Speaker 1>annuity pisses everywhere.</v>

2593
01:56:12.320 --> 01:56:13.740
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Back up and Piss on your wall.</v>

2594
01:56:13.741 --> 01:56:15.970
<v Speaker 1>This is mine and you can't stop them </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

2595
01:56:15.990 --> 01:56:17.550
<v Speaker 1>You're going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a cat do it.</v>

2596
01:56:17.640 --> 01:56:19.740
<v Speaker 1>I had my feral cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you ever met him.</v>

2597
01:56:20.040 --> 01:56:22.160
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever meet Jack Dempsey?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was the all black cat?</v>

2598
01:56:22.450 --> 01:56:25.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they'll kill them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2599
01:56:25.201 --> 01:56:25.800
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>

2600
01:56:25.920 --> 01:56:28.590
<v Speaker 1>Frank Sinatra.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The pit bull told them was awful.</v>

2601
01:56:29.880 --> 01:56:32.910
<v Speaker 1>He just got cocky one too many times </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the dog.</v>

2602
01:56:34.270 --> 01:56:36.360
<v Speaker 1>He's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a fierce little cat,</v>

2603
01:56:36.540 --> 01:56:37.740
<v Speaker 1>but he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had him neutered,</v>

2604
01:56:38.160 --> 01:56:43.160
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very rare that you find one that's </v>

2605
01:56:43.160 --> 01:56:43.160
<v Speaker 1>not neutered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2606
01:56:43.160 --> 01:56:44.190
<v Speaker 1>that my cat was feral,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I got him.</v>

2607
01:56:44.191 --> 01:56:48.600
<v Speaker 1>He was a couple months old and my friend</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lanie had rescued him and it was a total</v>

2608
01:56:48.601 --> 01:56:49.280
<v Speaker 1>disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

2609
01:56:49.290 --> 01:56:51.300
<v Speaker 1>I should never done it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when I brought him home,</v>

2610
01:56:51.301 --> 01:56:52.470
<v Speaker 1>he's pissing everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

2611
01:56:52.471 --> 01:56:54.420
<v Speaker 1>He's picking his ass up and trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>piss on the walls.</v>

2612
01:56:54.421 --> 01:56:55.950
<v Speaker 1>When I had to bring him to the vet to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get them,</v>

2613
01:56:55.951 --> 01:56:57.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get them neutered,</v>

2614
01:56:57.570 --> 01:57:01.440
<v Speaker 1>I literally had a throw a bathrobe over </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and tackle them in the bathroom.</v>

2615
01:57:01.950 --> 01:57:04.250
<v Speaker 1>I trapped them in the bathroom and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

2616
01:57:04.251 --> 01:57:06.150
<v Speaker 1>hissing at me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>climbing up the drapes.</v>

2617
01:57:06.151 --> 01:57:07.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen motherfucker,</v>

2618
01:57:07.260 --> 01:57:08.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love you.</v>

2619
01:57:09.240 --> 01:57:12.360
<v Speaker 1>Just here to take you to the vet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I picked him up once I picked them up</v>

2620
01:57:12.361 --> 01:57:13.680
<v Speaker 1>and start preparing like instantly,</v>

2621
01:57:16.980 --> 01:57:19.410
<v Speaker 1>like he would know that I was okay once </v>
<v Speaker 1>I picked them up,</v>

2622
01:57:19.411 --> 01:57:24.411
<v Speaker 1>but on the way to pick them up and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but fucking scramble up the walls and </v>

2623
01:57:25.641 --> 01:57:28.290
<v Speaker 1>it's run from me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the funniest shit ever.</v>

2624
01:57:28.650 --> 01:57:31.380
<v Speaker 1>And then I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I first adopted him,</v>

2625
01:57:32.160 --> 01:57:35.160
<v Speaker 1>I slept with him in a room for like </v>
<v Speaker 1>several days,</v>

2626
01:57:35.161 --> 01:57:37.950
<v Speaker 1>just me and him in the room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I pushed a bed into this room.</v>

2627
01:57:37.951 --> 01:57:39.820
<v Speaker 1>I had a spare bedroom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2628
01:57:40.030 --> 01:57:45.030
<v Speaker 1>I pushed a push some books in there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>like how to keep shutting the door real </v>

2629
01:57:45.030 --> 01:57:45.700
<v Speaker 1>quick so he couldn't run out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put them in there,</v>

2630
01:57:45.730 --> 01:57:48.840
<v Speaker 1>put a litter box in there and put some </v>
<v Speaker 1>food in there and just hung out with him</v>

2631
01:57:49.260 --> 01:57:51.960
<v Speaker 1>just so he totally got used to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I come near them,</v>

2632
01:57:52.020 --> 01:57:55.080
<v Speaker 1>even like after he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I picked him up a bunch of times.</v>

2633
01:57:55.440 --> 01:58:00.440
<v Speaker 1>I come here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to run across the walls.</v>

2634
01:58:01.010 --> 01:58:03.630
<v Speaker 1>He was a little tiny thing man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when I finally would get them</v>

2635
01:58:05.350 --> 01:58:05.710
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

2636
01:58:06.090 --> 01:58:09.000
<v Speaker 1>but as long as I kept a hold of him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was cool.</v>

2637
01:58:09.001 --> 01:58:12.090
<v Speaker 1>But as soon as I put them down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking started hitting,</v>

2638
01:58:12.140 --> 01:58:13.170
<v Speaker 1>running away.</v>

<v Speaker 4>That guy was nuts,</v>

2641
01:58:19.061 --> 01:58:21.010

<v Speaker 4>I had all black cat when I was a kid.</v>

2642
01:58:21.011 --> 01:58:23.430
<v Speaker 4>What do you think my mother named this </v>
<v Speaker 4>cat face?</v>

2643
01:58:24.560 --> 01:58:25.930
<v Speaker 4>Sam.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sambo.</v>

2644
01:58:25.990 --> 01:58:28.060
<v Speaker 4>Sambo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nice parents you got there,</v>

2645
01:58:28.240 --> 01:58:31.150

<v Speaker 4>the cat racist,</v>

2646
01:58:33.520 --> 01:58:36.070
<v Speaker 4>but those are too fucked up things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's very fucked up.</v>

2647
01:58:36.550 --> 01:58:39.670
<v Speaker 4>Why Sambo?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does sambo?</v>

2648
01:58:39.950 --> 01:58:42.280
<v Speaker 4>Sambo is reference to a chain</v>

2649
01:58:42.280 --> 01:58:45.310
<v Speaker 2>of restaurants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess 100 years ago,</v>

2650
01:58:45.311 --> 01:58:49.480
<v Speaker 2>it's very.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That aunt Jemima minstrel show.</v>

2651
01:58:49.510 --> 01:58:51.910
<v Speaker 2>Cartoonish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A minstrel.</v>

2652
01:58:51.911 --> 01:58:52.970
<v Speaker 2>Not Menstrual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2653
01:58:53.460 --> 01:58:56.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The racist thing.</v>

2654
01:58:57.060 --> 01:58:59.470
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's very like black face.</v>

2655
01:59:00.070 --> 01:59:02.220
<v Speaker 2>And there was a chain of restaurants </v>
<v Speaker 2>called Sam Bose.</v>

2656
01:59:02.770 --> 01:59:07.770
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2657
01:59:07.770 --> 01:59:08.170
<v Speaker 2>in the Bible named sambo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think that's true.</v>

2658
01:59:08.890 --> 01:59:11.980
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will Your Parents Bible thumpers?</v>

<v Speaker 2>so they're not really into it.</v>

2788
02:04:38.260 --> 02:04:41.280
<v Speaker 1>in a business that she started crying </v>
<v Speaker 1>and she said the problem was girls would</v>

2789
02:04:41.281 --> 02:04:43.320
<v Speaker 1>masturbate inside of them and they had </v>
<v Speaker 1>to clean it.</v>

2790
02:04:43.700 --> 02:04:45.680
<v Speaker 4>She does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes she could smell it.</v>

2791
02:04:45.930 --> 02:04:47.530
<v Speaker 4>She would go in there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could smell it.</v>

2792
02:04:47.540 --> 02:04:52.540
<v Speaker 4>These chicks just been fingering </v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves,</v>

<v Speaker 4>especially since the beats off </v>

<v Speaker 4>So you're just like naked or going,</v>

<v Speaker 4>always those hollow shitty doors shut </v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

2802
02:05:15.400 --> 02:05:16.660
<v Speaker 4>Clung,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Echo.</v>

2803
02:05:16.670 --> 02:05:21.050
<v Speaker 4>It's like this barely anybody could just</v>
<v Speaker 4>punch their hand through that door.</v>

2804
02:05:21.770 --> 02:05:23.990
<v Speaker 4>The shade design,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know like the shades,</v>

2805
02:05:23.991 --> 02:05:26.270
<v Speaker 4>like the window shade design where you </v>
<v Speaker 4>can actually see through it.</v>

2806
02:05:26.271 --> 02:05:28.850
<v Speaker 4>So if you walk past one you can see like</v>
<v Speaker 4>a second,</v>

2807
02:05:28.851 --> 02:05:30.190
<v Speaker 4>you could see a woman like laying there.</v>

2808
02:05:30.200 --> 02:05:31.820
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's Kinda crazy.</v>

2809
02:05:31.821 --> 02:05:36.821
<v Speaker 4>Like you're naked and you're compressed </v>
<v Speaker 4>in this thing that puts a light on you </v>

2810
02:05:36.821 --> 02:05:38.840
<v Speaker 4>that comes from metal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>glass tubes.</v>

2811
02:05:39.020 --> 02:05:44.020
<v Speaker 4>Like how weird are people man lying </v>
<v Speaker 4>there and you got little goggles on and </v>

2812
02:05:44.020 --> 02:05:47.591
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you're buttholes this but hold the </v>

2813
02:05:47.591 --> 02:05:49.811
<v Speaker 4>glass and you get that Weird Tan spot </v>
<v Speaker 4>where you get a little white spot in </v>

2814
02:05:50.631 --> 02:05:53.660
<v Speaker 4>between your ass cheeks because your </v>
<v Speaker 4>cheeks compressed when you lie there.</v>

2815
02:05:53.780 --> 02:05:57.800
<v Speaker 4>So like I would try to spread my ass </v>
<v Speaker 4>cheeks while we're in there to make sure</v>

2816
02:05:57.801 --> 02:06:01.430
<v Speaker 4>that I got some tanning on that one area</v>
<v Speaker 4>at tech.</v>

2817
02:06:01.431 --> 02:06:06.431
<v Speaker 4>My Dick though in between.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I don't want my Dick Tam for some </v>

2818
02:06:06.431 --> 02:06:06.860
<v Speaker 4>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It never needs a 10 but it could make it</v>

2819
02:06:06.861 --> 02:06:07.860
<v Speaker 4>look bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

2820
02:06:08.240 --> 02:06:09.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't.</v>

2821
02:06:09.490 --> 02:06:10.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it was bigger than their </v>
<v Speaker 1>white.</v>

2822
02:06:10.730 --> 02:06:12.590
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that why overweight people like to</v>
<v Speaker 1>wear black?</v>

2823
02:06:14.030 --> 02:06:17.000
<v Speaker 1>Black is slimming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why black dicks are so impressive</v>

2824
02:06:17.030 --> 02:06:22.030
<v Speaker 1>and seem like Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if it was white.</v>

2825
02:06:23.200 --> 02:06:27.200
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if you had a white Dick was all </v>
<v Speaker 1>white and it was giant.</v>

2826
02:06:27.560 --> 02:06:31.040

2869
02:08:24.700 --> 02:08:26.140
<v Speaker 1>Could hold my breath for like three </v>

<v Speaker 1>Show me okay on Ge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The inside of my pussy for three minutes</v>

<v Speaker 1>each.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The g spot?</v>

2872
02:08:34.030 --> 02:08:39.030
<v Speaker 1>Well there's certain animals that have </v>
<v Speaker 1>absorbed the mail after they breed a </v>

2873
02:08:40.120 --> 02:08:41.130
<v Speaker 1>black widow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2874
02:08:41.140 --> 02:08:45.430
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of a bunch of bugs that </v>
<v Speaker 1>kill the male after.</v>

2875
02:08:45.431 --> 02:08:47.500
<v Speaker 1>After they breed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think females do too.</v>

2876
02:08:47.501 --> 02:08:48.970
<v Speaker 1>I think praying mantis do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't they?</v>

2877
02:08:49.500 --> 02:08:51.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a bunch of.</v>

2878
02:08:51.281 --> 02:08:54.400
<v Speaker 1>A bunch of bugs that do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Black widows do the.</v>

2879
02:08:54.430 --> 02:08:59.430
<v Speaker 1>There's quite a few.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's one aunt where they take the </v>

2880
02:08:59.430 --> 02:09:00.940
<v Speaker 1>mail and they bite all of his fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>limbs off.</v>

2881
02:09:00.941 --> 02:09:05.941
<v Speaker 1>Like the male is like bigger and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>take them and they bite all of his legs </v>

2882
02:09:05.941 --> 02:09:09.991
<v Speaker 1>and wings off and then they bring them </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the hive and then they make them </v>

2883
02:09:09.991 --> 02:09:13.011
<v Speaker 1>breed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's weird that there's this society </v>

2884
02:09:13.011 --> 02:09:13.011
<v Speaker 1>where like that's all the males are good</v>
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>

2885
02:09:13.011 --> 02:09:13.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's the society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2886
02:09:13.991 --> 02:09:18.991
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy little and it's a group </v>

2887
02:09:18.991 --> 02:09:21.370
<v Speaker 1>that's the real danger about spaceman is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that like a starship trooper style.</v>

2888
02:09:21.700 --> 02:09:25.420
<v Speaker 1>You could land somewhere and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>giant bugs like that.</v>

2889
02:09:25.421 --> 02:09:26.930
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the reality.</v>

2890
02:09:27.210 --> 02:09:29.320
<v Speaker 1>Like we're lucky to have plugs are </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking little man.</v>

2891
02:09:29.350 --> 02:09:30.790
<v Speaker 1>No kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They live with us.</v>

2892
02:09:30.940 --> 02:09:32.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean they are in our world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2893
02:09:32.870 --> 02:09:35.620
<v Speaker 1>I found a praying mantis the other day </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I got a video of this.</v>

2894
02:09:35.920 --> 02:09:40.920
<v Speaker 1>My daughter found it and I put it on her</v>
<v Speaker 1>hand and then she was holding it and </v>

2895
02:09:40.920 --> 02:09:42.570
<v Speaker 1>they try to get you and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they can't get you there,</v>

2896
02:09:42.730 --> 02:09:45.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can get like a bug or a hummingbird</v>

2897
02:09:45.641 --> 02:09:50.641
<v Speaker 1>or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they really can't get a person and </v>

2898
02:09:50.641 --> 02:09:54.720
<v Speaker 1>we put it on this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this branch and just right where we put </v>

2899
02:09:54.720 --> 02:09:54.720
<v Speaker 1>it just by total luck.</v>

2900
02:09:54.720 --> 02:09:57.220
<v Speaker 1>It was a bunch of ants crawling on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>branch and just starts eating the ants.</v>

2901
02:09:57.340 --> 02:10:02.340
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just picking him up and eating them </v>

2902
02:10:02.340 --> 02:10:03.460
<v Speaker 1>while sitting there and they were going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

2903
02:10:03.461 --> 02:10:04.420
<v Speaker 1>he's eating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The aunts were like,</v>

2904
02:10:04.421 --> 02:10:05.530
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is so cool.</v>

2905
02:10:05.680 --> 02:10:08.800
<v Speaker 1>And I tried to video it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just hard to like get that in,</v>

2906
02:10:09.010 --> 02:10:10.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

2907
02:10:10.750 --> 02:10:13.540
<v Speaker 1>that's going on right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

2908
02:10:13.541 --> 02:10:15.130
<v Speaker 1>Like that is a reality of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

2909
02:10:15.131 --> 02:10:20.131
<v Speaker 1>if that thing was as big as a giraffe </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the answer to the size of pigs and </v>

2910
02:10:20.131 --> 02:10:24.541
<v Speaker 1>you open your window,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you looked out there and you see this </v>

2911
02:10:24.541 --> 02:10:26.461
<v Speaker 1>fucking eating paste the pigs can and </v>
<v Speaker 1>try to get away.</v>

2912
02:10:28.240 --> 02:10:31.270
<v Speaker 1>We would live in a horrific environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like starship troopers.</v>

2913
02:10:31.570 --> 02:10:34.540
<v Speaker 1>Like the only difference between that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

2914
02:10:34.610 --> 02:10:39.610
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and our reality is that these bugs are </v>

2915
02:10:39.610 --> 02:10:39.610
<v Speaker 1>small,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2916
02:10:39.610 --> 02:10:39.610
<v Speaker 1>But there bugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man bugs.</v>

2917
02:10:39.610 --> 02:10:41.780
<v Speaker 1>They have a Dev,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no motions yet.</v>

2918
02:10:42.080 --> 02:10:43.150
<v Speaker 1>As far as we know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2919
02:10:43.220 --> 02:10:47.430
<v Speaker 1>they lived this very alien,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost mechanical life there.</v>

2920
02:10:47.431 --> 02:10:52.431
<v Speaker 1>They're like similar to like robots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like a little weird robotic </v>

2921
02:10:53.060 --> 02:10:56.060
<v Speaker 1>alien creature that lives side by side </v>
<v Speaker 1>with us.</v>

2922
02:10:56.061 --> 02:10:59.170
<v Speaker 1>It's just so small we don't think about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't a word.</v>

2923
02:10:59.190 --> 02:10:59.530
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2924
02:10:59.560 --> 02:11:02.540
<v Speaker 1>like the see all their friends getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>eaten and they don't react to it,</v>

2925
02:11:02.541 --> 02:11:07.541
<v Speaker 1>but they just walk right into the walk </v>
<v Speaker 1>right into it because they're </v>

2926
02:11:07.541 --> 02:11:07.541
<v Speaker 1>programmed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not</v>

2927
02:11:07.541 --> 02:11:08.680
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I almost think like in the future way,</v>

2928
02:11:08.710 --> 02:11:13.710
<v Speaker 3>thousands of years we're going to find </v>
<v Speaker 3>out the bugs and stuff are actually </v>

2929
02:11:13.710 --> 02:11:14.630
<v Speaker 3>completely way more advanced than us and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2930
02:11:14.900 --> 02:11:15.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2931
02:11:15.730 --> 02:11:18.280
<v Speaker 3>look at hummingbirds that doesn't look </v>
<v Speaker 3>like nature,</v>

2932
02:11:18.290 --> 02:11:20.560
<v Speaker 3>that it looks like a fucking jet </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighter.</v>

2933
02:11:21.150 --> 02:11:26.150
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that does not seem like the same thing </v>

2934
02:11:26.150 --> 02:11:26.150
<v Speaker 3>as a snail.</v>

2935
02:11:26.150 --> 02:11:30.450
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you imagine if someone could figure </v>

2936
02:11:30.450 --> 02:11:30.450
<v Speaker 1>out a way to make a military aircraft </v>
<v Speaker 1>that can maneuver like a hummingbird,</v>

2937
02:11:30.520 --> 02:11:32.530
<v Speaker 1>like a large military occur,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ethical,</v>

2938
02:11:35.610 --> 02:11:39.280
<v Speaker 1>like what they can do is incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ways that we can move back and forth</v>

2939
02:11:39.281 --> 02:11:39.910
<v Speaker 1>and all around,</v>

02:12:46.851 --> 02:12:48.350
<v Speaker 1>that was just a short amount of time </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>

2970
02:12:49.610 --> 02:12:52.670
<v Speaker 1>But if we ever landed on another planet </v>
<v Speaker 1>and found bugs,</v>

2971
02:12:52.700 --> 02:12:55.160
<v Speaker 1>like big giant bugs like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2972
02:12:55.161 --> 02:12:57.830
<v Speaker 1>what a mind fuck that would be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you landed on some planet?</v>

2973
02:12:57.831 --> 02:13:02.831
<v Speaker 1>And it was enormous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dinosaur size praying mantises running </v>

2974
02:13:02.831 --> 02:13:03.170
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They attack the drone.</v>

2975
02:13:03.340 --> 02:13:08.340
<v Speaker 1>Like we landed drone somewhere and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking picks up the drone and crushes </v>

2976
02:13:08.340 --> 02:13:08.540
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>starts sucking the batteries out of it,</v>

2977
02:13:09.010 --> 02:13:11.530
<v Speaker 3>or if it had all the same animals and </v>
<v Speaker 3>people and stuff,</v>

2978
02:13:11.531 --> 02:13:16.531
<v Speaker 3>but mixed together weird like humans </v>
<v Speaker 3>were like in love with ostriches or </v>

2979
02:13:16.531 --> 02:13:19.520
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>

2980
02:13:19.610 --> 02:13:24.610
<v Speaker 1>what about a species specific meeting </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't necessarily that everything </v>

2981
02:13:24.610 --> 02:13:25.420
<v Speaker 1>fucked everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hybrids.</v>

2982
02:13:25.460 --> 02:13:27.980
<v Speaker 1>Everywhere you looked like dog hybrids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can fucking.</v>

2983
02:13:29.040 --> 02:13:30.800
<v Speaker 1>You can fucking anything you wanted and </v>
<v Speaker 1>every.</v>

2984
02:13:30.870 --> 02:13:35.870
<v Speaker 1>Whenever you fuck something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would make a combination like </v>

2985
02:13:35.870 --> 02:13:35.870
<v Speaker 1>everybody get everybody pregnant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including animals.</v>

2986
02:13:35.870 --> 02:13:36.960
<v Speaker 1>Get people pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be so much fun.</v>

2987
02:13:37.440 --> 02:13:39.030
<v Speaker 1>So cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd be in the old comedy.</v>

2988
02:13:39.090 --> 02:13:41.190
<v Speaker 1>That little bear you get herpes out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2989
02:13:41.191 --> 02:13:44.190
<v Speaker 1>but it'd be worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be figuring out a way to make a</v>

2990
02:13:44.191 --> 02:13:46.390
<v Speaker 1>weapon to protect your butthole </v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere you.</v>

2991
02:13:46.440 --> 02:13:48.720
<v Speaker 1>Every time you left the house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something will be trying to fuck you and</v>

2992
02:13:48.721 --> 02:13:53.721
<v Speaker 1>get you pregnant and then you try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell people about this planet and all </v>

2993
02:13:53.721 --> 02:13:54.190
<v Speaker 1>they care about is your fucking tee </v>
<v Speaker 1>shirt.</v>

2994
02:13:54.240 --> 02:13:55.200
<v Speaker 1>Imagine how much.</v>

2995
02:13:57.450 --> 02:14:00.210
<v Speaker 1>Imagine how much more sensitive we would</v>
<v Speaker 1>all be to each other if we could.</v>

2996
02:14:00.211 --> 02:14:03.990
<v Speaker 1>All get pregnant if it was universal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if everybody got pregnant,</v>

2997
02:14:03.991 --> 02:14:07.500
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't trust anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if there was no disparity.</v>

2998
02:14:08.840 --> 02:14:13.840
<v Speaker 1>Sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about how much disparity there is </v>

2999
02:14:13.840 --> 02:14:15.120
<v Speaker 1>and like physical strength and ability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we were looking at Shaquille o'neal</v>

3000
02:14:15.121 --> 02:14:20.121
<v Speaker 1>and his wife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously he's just so much bigger and </v>

3001
02:14:20.121 --> 02:14:20.121
<v Speaker 1>stronger than her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

3002
02:14:20.121 --> 02:14:20.760
<v Speaker 1>but what if everybody was the exact same</v>
<v Speaker 1>size,</v>

3003
02:14:20.761 --> 02:14:23.670
<v Speaker 1>like all people are the exact same size </v>
<v Speaker 1>and everybody could get everybody.</v>

3004
02:14:23.910 --> 02:14:25.260
<v Speaker 1>Now you're talking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

3005
02:14:25.620 --> 02:14:27.390
<v Speaker 1>What would the reality of this world </v>
<v Speaker 1>bait?</v>

3006
02:14:27.420 --> 02:14:31.590
<v Speaker 1>Would there be more people or less </v>
<v Speaker 1>people will depend on our urges,</v>

3007
02:14:31.591 --> 02:14:33.450
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have the same urges.</v>

3008
02:14:33.451 --> 02:14:38.451
<v Speaker 1>It's probably the same amount of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just figured out a way to deal with </v>

3009
02:14:38.451 --> 02:14:38.730
<v Speaker 1>the fact that we're just going to fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>

3010
02:14:39.480 --> 02:14:39.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3011
02:14:39.810 --> 02:14:42.270
<v Speaker 1>I think it would be relatively the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of people because most.</v>

3012
02:14:42.271 --> 02:14:46.110
<v Speaker 1>I'd say most children come from a a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mutual relationship.</v>

3013
02:14:46.390 --> 02:14:49.440
<v Speaker 1>We'll just think about how many people </v>
<v Speaker 1>back in the Roman days,</v>

3014
02:14:49.470 --> 02:14:54.470
<v Speaker 1>how many men went gay because they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>just off on campaign together in there,</v>

3015
02:14:55.080 --> 02:15:00.080
<v Speaker 1>but fucking fees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Musky unshaven shit.</v>

3016
02:15:00.150 --> 02:15:05.150
<v Speaker 1>Smeared assholes have soared murderer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No babies should be born that way.</v>

3017
02:15:05.480 --> 02:15:10.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is not a love child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason why they went case because </v>

3018
02:15:10.480 --> 02:15:13.940
<v Speaker 1>back then they didn't have anything to </v>
<v Speaker 1>clean their pussies and then he just </v>

3019
02:15:13.940 --> 02:15:16.491
<v Speaker 1>smelled really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really bad like pussy smell and dude's </v>

3020
02:15:16.491 --> 02:15:19.630
<v Speaker 1>ass hole unless you're shooting out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your pussy because you can wipe the </v>

3021
02:15:19.630 --> 02:15:22.080
<v Speaker 1>outside of your butthole out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like there's just like shit dying in</v>

3022
02:15:22.081 --> 02:15:27.081
<v Speaker 1>those pussies some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think some of it probably smelled </v>

3023
02:15:27.081 --> 02:15:28.120
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet people you know,</v>

3024
02:15:28.121 --> 02:15:30.810
<v Speaker 1>like people are not supposed to be like </v>
<v Speaker 1>washing with soap,</v>

3025
02:15:30.870 --> 02:15:35.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they said that they say that like when </v>

3026
02:15:35.870 --> 02:15:37.701
<v Speaker 1>you wash with like one of the things a </v>
<v Speaker 1>big mistake people make when they do </v>

3027
02:15:37.701 --> 02:15:40.521
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't take a shower right before you go </v>

3028
02:15:40.521 --> 02:15:40.521
<v Speaker 1>to class.</v>

3029
02:15:40.521 --> 02:15:40.521
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You actually shouldn't.</v>

3030
02:15:40.521 --> 02:15:45.050
<v Speaker 1>You should like limit your showering to </v>
<v Speaker 1>about two hours before class because </v>

3031
02:15:45.050 --> 02:15:46.500
<v Speaker 1>when you shower it takes about a half an</v>
<v Speaker 1>hour.</v>

3032
02:15:46.530 --> 02:15:51.530
<v Speaker 1>Supposedly from the stuff I've read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously I'm no expert for your body's </v>

3033
02:15:51.530 --> 02:15:53.220
<v Speaker 1>natural flora to start to replenish </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

3034
02:15:53.610 --> 02:15:58.610
<v Speaker 1>So if you go get scratched or you do </v>
<v Speaker 1>something where you're going to be in </v>

3035
02:15:58.610 --> 02:16:00.730
<v Speaker 1>physical contact with someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3036
02:16:01.210 --> 02:16:06.210
<v Speaker 1>then you take a shower first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a higher likelihood of you not </v>

3037
02:16:06.210 --> 02:16:08.310
<v Speaker 1>having the skin flora to fight off any </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential.</v>

3038
02:16:08.370 --> 02:16:13.370
<v Speaker 1>Weird Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting because I always </v>

3039
02:16:13.370 --> 02:16:13.370
<v Speaker 1>shave after I shower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can do that.</v>

3040
02:16:13.370 --> 02:16:13.590
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

3041
02:16:13.770 --> 02:16:14.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's different.</v>

3042
02:16:14.491 --> 02:16:15.820
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3043
02:16:15.880 --> 02:16:18.180
<v Speaker 1>that's not the same as shaving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like an injury.</v>

3044
02:16:19.140 --> 02:16:22.530
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing when you're shaving?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always cut myself.</v>

3045
02:16:22.800 --> 02:16:24.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I missed,</v>

3046
02:16:24.690 --> 02:16:26.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu.</v>

3047
02:16:26.461 --> 02:16:29.530
<v Speaker 1>You get staph infections and funk.</v>

3048
02:16:29.770 --> 02:16:34.770
<v Speaker 1>Gotcha to ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think the point being that a </v>

3049
02:16:34.770 --> 02:16:36.370
<v Speaker 1>woman's natural flora,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the natural bacteria in her body,</v>

3050
02:16:36.550 --> 02:16:41.380
<v Speaker 1>that's why one of the reasons why women </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposedly are more susceptible to yeast</v>

3051
02:16:41.381 --> 02:16:46.381
<v Speaker 1>infections when they take antibiotics </v>
<v Speaker 1>because antibiotics kills all the </v>

3052
02:16:46.381 --> 02:16:47.560
<v Speaker 1>bacteria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The good stuff too.</v>

3053
02:16:47.920 --> 02:16:52.920
<v Speaker 1>And so they can get the poster form and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a smell.</v>

3054
02:16:57.540 --> 02:16:59.620
<v Speaker 1>And this is not any woman's fault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3055
02:16:59.621 --> 02:17:04.621
<v Speaker 1>This is just unfortunate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a smell that is capable of </v>

3056
02:17:04.621 --> 02:17:06.460
<v Speaker 1>coming out of a vagina that until you </v>
<v Speaker 1>smell it,</v>

3057
02:17:06.520 --> 02:17:08.830
<v Speaker 1>you can't believe it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when you do smell it and you go,</v>

3058
02:17:08.831 --> 02:17:12.040
<v Speaker 1>how is this possible?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How is it possible that the human body,</v>

3059
02:17:12.250 --> 02:17:13.630
<v Speaker 1>what is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the human body?</v>

3060
02:17:13.640 --> 02:17:17.460
<v Speaker 1>St will warn you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to say this is good,</v>

3061
02:17:17.710 --> 02:17:19.090
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't go down there.</v>

3062
02:17:20.170 --> 02:17:21.670
<v Speaker 1>How come?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that's the case,</v>

3063
02:17:21.700 --> 02:17:23.860
<v Speaker 1>why doesn't hurt me smell?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3064
02:17:23.861 --> 02:17:25.120
<v Speaker 1>It should.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How come?</v>

3065
02:17:25.140 --> 02:17:28.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeast infection smell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but why doesn't venereal disease isn't a</v>

3066
02:17:28.331 --> 02:17:29.340
<v Speaker 1>person smell again.</v>

3067
02:17:31.640 --> 02:17:36.640
<v Speaker 4>And how can dog sometimes smell cancer?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what they train them to smell </v>

3068
02:17:36.640 --> 02:17:40.861
<v Speaker 4>cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you hear about this guy that </v>

3069
02:17:40.861 --> 02:17:42.931
<v Speaker 4>recently lost his hearing and he can now</v>
<v Speaker 4>only here like Wifi signals wherever he </v>

3070
02:17:43.121 --> 02:17:46.410
<v Speaker 4>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's almost deaf,</v>

3071
02:17:46.420 --> 02:17:49.870
<v Speaker 4>but it's driving him crazy because he </v>
<v Speaker 4>can only hear Wifi signals.</v>

3072
02:17:50.080 --> 02:17:52.030
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That sounds like hell on her.</v>

3073
02:17:53.030 --> 02:17:53.350
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3074
02:17:53.351 --> 02:17:56.320
<v Speaker 4>they say that bees can hear cell phone </v>
<v Speaker 4>signal's really.</v>

3075
02:17:57.040 --> 02:17:58.990
<v Speaker 4>Is that where they're dying off?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's that.</v>

3076
02:17:58.991 --> 02:18:00.820
<v Speaker 4>And there's also pesticides,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3077
02:18:00.821 --> 02:18:03.880
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have a bunch of bs,</v>

3078
02:18:03.881 --> 02:18:08.881
<v Speaker 4>died off really recently,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like millions of bees and it coincided </v>

3079
02:18:08.881 --> 02:18:13.261
<v Speaker 4>with the production of some genetically </v>
<v Speaker 4>modified crop that resist pesticides was</v>

3080
02:18:13.871 --> 02:18:15.580
<v Speaker 4>real recent story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll pull it up.</v>

3081
02:18:16.240 --> 02:18:21.240
<v Speaker 4>That's why these a big gossipy lately.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And bees bees going extinct as a way </v>

3082
02:18:21.431 --> 02:18:23.620
<v Speaker 4>bigger problem than say Koala bears go </v>
<v Speaker 4>extinct.</v>

3083
02:18:23.621 --> 02:18:23.860
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3084
02:18:23.930 --> 02:18:24.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3085
02:18:24.791 --> 02:18:25.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3086
02:18:25.530 --> 02:18:27.880
<v Speaker 1>These are really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really a big issue.</v>

3087
02:18:27.920 --> 02:18:29.050
<v Speaker 1>When,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when bees die,</v>

3088
02:18:29.110 --> 02:18:32.680
<v Speaker 1>it's not good at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trying to find the most recent shit.</v>

3089
02:18:34.020 --> 02:18:34.290
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

3090
02:18:34.690 --> 02:18:39.160
<v Speaker 4>it's a very recent story you've ever met</v>
<v Speaker 4>a guy that collected butterflies?</v>

3091
02:18:40.240 --> 02:18:43.300
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the pins in the box.</v>

3092
02:18:43.310 --> 02:18:45.250
<v Speaker 4>I was just seeing that like in movies </v>
<v Speaker 4>and shit,</v>

3093
02:18:45.251 --> 02:18:46.750
<v Speaker 4>but I've never seen anyone actually do </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

3094
02:18:47.030 --> 02:18:50.830
<v Speaker 1>A man who can hear Wifi wherever you </v>
<v Speaker 1>will.</v>

3095
02:18:51.640 --> 02:18:54.910
<v Speaker 1>There's insecticides that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>blaming on killing off bs.</v>

3096
02:18:54.911 --> 02:18:58.630
<v Speaker 1>I think apparently the Wifi signals and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3097
02:18:58.631 --> 02:19:03.631
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any like radio signals and cell phone </v>

3098
02:19:03.631 --> 02:19:06.541
<v Speaker 1>signals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all have the potential to disrupt </v>

3099
02:19:06.541 --> 02:19:09.511
<v Speaker 1>the natural communication methods that a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of insects use and beads especially </v>

3100
02:19:09.511 --> 02:19:13.000
<v Speaker 1>are sort of susceptible to a cell phone </v>
<v Speaker 1>signals the flux with them.</v>

3101
02:19:13.810 --> 02:19:16.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of bees.</v>

3102
02:19:16.601 --> 02:19:21.601
<v Speaker 1>Did I to find this be used to because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were trying to figure out what it </v>

3103
02:19:23.861 --> 02:19:26.950
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did $37 million bees fall out of the</v>

3104
02:19:26.960 --> 02:19:28.880
<v Speaker 1>air?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thirty 7 million.</v>

3105
02:19:28.910 --> 02:19:31.070
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty crazy.</v>

3106
02:19:31.700 --> 02:19:33.740
<v Speaker 1>And they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to put it together.</v>

3107
02:19:33.741 --> 02:19:36.950
<v Speaker 1>But some people of course are connecting</v>
<v Speaker 1>it with genetically modified corn.</v>

3108
02:19:36.951 --> 02:19:41.951
<v Speaker 1>So as the shock incident came just weeks</v>
<v Speaker 1>after genetically modified corn was </v>

3109
02:19:41.951 --> 02:19:45.761
<v Speaker 1>planted in Ontario,</v>
<v Speaker 1>according to the local honey gatherers </v>

3110
02:19:45.761 --> 02:19:49.750
<v Speaker 1>beekeeper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dave Schultz lost about $37 million </v>

3111
02:19:49.750 --> 02:19:50.990
<v Speaker 1>bees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is around 600 hives.</v>

3112
02:19:51.770 --> 02:19:53.990
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Urban homestead,</v>

3113
02:19:53.991 --> 02:19:55.850
<v Speaker 1>honey.com</v>
<v Speaker 1>is where he,</v>

3114
02:19:55.851 --> 02:19:57.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did this interview.</v>

3115
02:19:57.531 --> 02:19:59.780
<v Speaker 1>He said once the corn started to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>planted,</v>

3116
02:19:59.781 --> 02:20:04.781
<v Speaker 1>our bees died by the millions that </v>
<v Speaker 1>collapsed in the local honeybee </v>

3117
02:20:04.781 --> 02:20:07.520
<v Speaker 1>population is called why caused </v>
<v Speaker 1>widespread concern with many pointing to</v>

3118
02:20:07.521 --> 02:20:11.360
<v Speaker 1>pesticides as the cause in the decline </v>
<v Speaker 1>of colonies.</v>

3119
02:20:11.660 --> 02:20:13.360
<v Speaker 1>Yet supposedly they were making a </v>
<v Speaker 1>comeback though.</v>

3120
02:20:14.030 --> 02:20:16.310
<v Speaker 1>Some recent reports like this one says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after decline,</v>

3121
02:20:16.311 --> 02:20:18.570
<v Speaker 1>honey bears are appear to making honey </v>
<v Speaker 1>bees.</v>

3122
02:20:18.760 --> 02:20:19.290
<v Speaker 1>Honey bees.</v>

3123
02:20:22.800 --> 02:20:26.960
<v Speaker 1>Bigger bus kids need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3124
02:20:27.530 --> 02:20:29.140
<v Speaker 1>yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3125
02:20:29.290 --> 02:20:34.290
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like when people fuck with nature </v>

3126
02:20:34.290 --> 02:20:37.961
<v Speaker 1>like that and you start messing around </v>
<v Speaker 1>adding pesticides and pesticide </v>

3127
02:20:37.961 --> 02:20:41.970
<v Speaker 1>resistant plants and you start fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>with what that plan is and then these be</v>

3128
02:20:41.971 --> 02:20:44.760
<v Speaker 1>started dying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3129
02:20:44.770 --> 02:20:46.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm all for.</v>

3130
02:20:48.170 --> 02:20:49.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm all for people trying to improve </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

3131
02:20:49.911 --> 02:20:50.610
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

3132
02:20:50.611 --> 02:20:55.611
<v Speaker 1>this seems like a complete disaster if </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what it actually turns out to be </v>

3133
02:20:55.611 --> 02:20:56.150
<v Speaker 1>doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's scary shit too man.</v>

3134
02:20:56.360 --> 02:20:58.100
<v Speaker 1>That someone could just invent something</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

3135
02:20:58.340 --> 02:21:00.800
<v Speaker 1>Thirty 7 million bees can die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like instantly.</v>

3136
02:21:01.100 --> 02:21:02.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That we're capable of doing that.</v>

3137
02:21:02.830 --> 02:21:07.830
<v Speaker 1>It was just total unintended consequence</v>
<v Speaker 1>of creating this pesticide resistant </v>

3138
02:21:08.030 --> 02:21:13.030
<v Speaker 1>plant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You plant it and then just everything </v>

3139
02:21:13.030 --> 02:21:15.101
<v Speaker 1>dies dear start fucking stiff leg and in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the middle of the street and you don't </v>

3140
02:21:15.111 --> 02:21:17.900
<v Speaker 1>even fall from the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't really know how it happened.</v>

3141
02:21:18.320 --> 02:21:23.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because birds eat the insects and </v>

3142
02:21:23.320 --> 02:21:25.331
<v Speaker 1>insects eat the pesticides and all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit just comes together and then you </v>

3143
02:21:25.331 --> 02:21:29.621
<v Speaker 1>get cancer from eating the birds and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're promoting pseudoscience.</v>

3144
02:21:30.440 --> 02:21:35.440
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you just stand those </v>

3145
02:21:35.440 --> 02:21:38.120
<v Speaker 1>anti-vaccine man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're anti science.</v>

3146
02:21:38.300 --> 02:21:43.300
<v Speaker 1>I think it's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's science in $37 million bees </v>

3147
02:21:43.300 --> 02:21:47.260
<v Speaker 1>dying right after genetically modified </v>
<v Speaker 1>corn is being planted.</v>

3148
02:21:47.661 --> 02:21:51.200
<v Speaker 1>I think there's probably like science to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be had there.</v>

3149
02:21:51.260 --> 02:21:56.260
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like if you studied it and you </v>

3150
02:21:56.260 --> 02:21:56.630
<v Speaker 1>analyze the data,</v>

3151
02:21:58.140 --> 02:22:00.400
<v Speaker 1>just the idea of being a b is pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking trippy.</v>

3152
02:22:02.320 --> 02:22:04.270
<v Speaker 1>Living with a bunch of other assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3153
02:22:04.271 --> 02:22:09.271
<v Speaker 1>Making this weird fucking geometric </v>
<v Speaker 1>pattern with little cubicles and </v>

3154
02:22:09.271 --> 02:22:10.870
<v Speaker 1>everybody lives in these cubicles and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they all know how to do it.</v>

3155
02:22:11.140 --> 02:22:16.140
<v Speaker 1>They all know no bees come along with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They forget the old ways and I had to </v>

3156
02:22:16.140 --> 02:22:19.790
<v Speaker 1>make hives every year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They figured out how to make homes and </v>

3157
02:22:19.790 --> 02:22:22.650
<v Speaker 1>then that queen can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She goes around stabbing all the female </v>

3158
02:22:22.650 --> 02:22:25.561
<v Speaker 1>babies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Queen Bee is the only one that </v>

3159
02:22:25.561 --> 02:22:26.660
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have a retractable removable </v>
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>

3160
02:22:26.670 --> 02:22:28.500
<v Speaker 1>Her little pincher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her little,</v>

3161
02:22:28.770 --> 02:22:30.980
<v Speaker 1>her little pussy nail that she has down </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

3162
02:22:31.080 --> 02:22:34.860
<v Speaker 1>Her Stinger doesn't go out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She can stinky all day.</v>

3163
02:22:34.960 --> 02:22:39.960
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason why so that she can </v>

3164
02:22:39.960 --> 02:22:39.960
<v Speaker 1>murder female babies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she goes near the hive,</v>

3165
02:22:40.260 --> 02:22:43.610
<v Speaker 1>sniffs out when she smells a female one </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the actual steps.</v>

3166
02:22:43.770 --> 02:22:44.850
<v Speaker 1>That shit out of it.</v>

3167
02:22:46.230 --> 02:22:48.560
<v Speaker 1>She's stabbing babies so she doesn't get</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

3168
02:22:48.570 --> 02:22:50.880
<v Speaker 1>It can be born so she doesn't get </v>
<v Speaker 1>overthrown by a female.</v>

3169
02:22:50.881 --> 02:22:52.650
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there can be only one.</v>

3170
02:22:52.651 --> 02:22:57.651
<v Speaker 1>It's like highlander which goes around </v>
<v Speaker 1>with their sword pussy and just starts </v>

3171
02:22:57.651 --> 02:23:01.371
<v Speaker 1>stabbing little little baby females in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their box before they even get hatched </v>

3172
02:23:01.590 --> 02:23:03.360
<v Speaker 1>and they spend their whole lives just </v>
<v Speaker 1>making honey.</v>

3173
02:23:03.361 --> 02:23:05.670
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they could be the size of horses.</v>

3174
02:23:05.820 --> 02:23:07.590
<v Speaker 1>It's more humane way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine.</v>

3175
02:23:07.950 --> 02:23:10.200
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck that match.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they were like elephants,</v>

3176
02:23:12.750 --> 02:23:17.280
<v Speaker 1>big conti flying elephants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That stang babies would be.</v>

3177
02:23:17.500 --> 02:23:20.530
<v Speaker 1>Would we still be so kind?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they gave us honey now.</v>

3178
02:23:20.580 --> 02:23:25.580
<v Speaker 1>Fuck honey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At that point in fighter jets after </v>

3179
02:23:25.580 --> 02:23:27.480
<v Speaker 1>those bitches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hae a batch.</v>

3180
02:23:27.520 --> 02:23:29.070
<v Speaker 1>Would have been due to a fighter jet </v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

3181
02:23:29.071 --> 02:23:31.590
<v Speaker 1>Probably just grab it and rip it apart </v>
<v Speaker 1>for b.</v>

3182
02:23:31.591 --> 02:23:36.591
<v Speaker 1>was the size of an elephant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It probably just throw jets out of the </v>

3183
02:23:36.591 --> 02:23:36.591
<v Speaker 1>sky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just grab bitch.</v>

3184
02:23:36.591 --> 02:23:38.970
<v Speaker 1>Stick a Stinger right through it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take you to a volcano.</v>

3185
02:23:39.060 --> 02:23:42.660
<v Speaker 1>We see fucking live video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The pilot screaming is the bees flew him</v>

3186
02:23:42.661 --> 02:23:44.100
<v Speaker 1>over the volcano and drop them in.</v>

3187
02:23:49.210 --> 02:23:52.800
<v Speaker 1>I hope we never get to this point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>

3188
02:23:52.890 --> 02:23:55.890
<v Speaker 1>What do you think we would do if if </v>
<v Speaker 1>insects started getting bigger?</v>

3189
02:23:56.530 --> 02:24:01.530
<v Speaker 1>They just kept getting bigger and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know how like every year it gets a </v>

3190
02:24:01.530 --> 02:24:04.371
<v Speaker 1>little warmer as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First I'd panic and not know what the </v>

3191
02:24:04.371 --> 02:24:08.721
<v Speaker 1>fuck did though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long would it take before we would </v>

3192
02:24:08.721 --> 02:24:10.860
<v Speaker 1>act if bees started getting like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>big of bees started getting that big and</v>

3193
02:24:10.861 --> 02:24:15.861
<v Speaker 1>if kids kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm holding up is a coffee stirrer </v>

3194
02:24:15.861 --> 02:24:16.980
<v Speaker 1>that's probably about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was at about four inches.</v>

3195
02:24:17.010 --> 02:24:17.730
<v Speaker 1>Five inches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It was only like a day or so old because</v>

3273
02:27:50.911 --> 02:27:52.900
<v Speaker 1>there was still meat on the bones and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're still like,</v>

3274
02:27:53.490 --> 02:27:57.300
<v Speaker 1>like the tissue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the meat tissue around the legs.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's all moose hair.</v>

3281
02:28:10.200 --> 02:28:15.200
<v Speaker 1>And they uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wolves had drawn a calf and calves </v>

3282
02:28:15.200 --> 02:28:15.740
<v Speaker 1>are huge.</v>

<v Speaker 1>of a big deer,</v>

3284
02:28:19.330 --> 02:28:24.330
<v Speaker 1>like they're really big and just tore </v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing apart and we came upon it </v>

3285
02:28:24.330 --> 02:28:28.830
<v Speaker 1>whatever a day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two days after they did it and we came </v>

3286
02:28:28.830 --> 02:28:30.800
<v Speaker 1>upon it because the Guy Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the guy that we were with,</v>

3287
02:28:30.801 --> 02:28:33.200
<v Speaker 1>he saw crows flying overhead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>

3288
02:28:33.240 --> 02:28:35.650
<v Speaker 1>let's go find out what these guys are </v>
<v Speaker 1>eating right.</v>

3289
02:28:35.840 --> 02:28:40.790
<v Speaker 1>And we could smell it as we got closer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just so eerie to be right there</v>

3290
02:28:40.791 --> 02:28:45.791
<v Speaker 1>where you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that some wolves were like howling and </v>

3291
02:28:45.791 --> 02:28:46.040
<v Speaker 1>ripping apart this thing and he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>still alive.</v>

3292
02:28:46.820 --> 02:28:47.630
<v Speaker 1>The.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

3293
02:28:47.780 --> 02:28:50.660
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well the horror of all that shit.</v>

3294
02:28:51.020 --> 02:28:56.020
<v Speaker 1>This guy who was there said that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>Guy Mike said that his friend had found </v>

3295
02:28:56.721 --> 02:29:01.721
<v Speaker 1>a moose that had lived for three days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why wolves were eating it's ass and </v>

3296
02:29:01.721 --> 02:29:05.450
<v Speaker 1>somehow stayed alive and in shock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when they came upon the happened,</v>

3297
02:29:05.451 --> 02:29:10.451
<v Speaker 1>it took three days and they were there </v>
<v Speaker 1>when it first started and they didn't </v>

3298
02:29:10.451 --> 02:29:13.991
<v Speaker 1>step in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't intervene and the wolves I </v>

3299
02:29:13.991 --> 02:29:13.991
<v Speaker 1>can and they came back two and a half </v>
<v Speaker 1>days later.</v>

3300
02:29:13.991 --> 02:29:18.731
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking Moose was still alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then shock while the wolves were like </v>

3301
02:29:18.731 --> 02:29:22.370
<v Speaker 1>eating its legs and its asset end </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if they eat it slowly,</v>

3302
02:29:22.520 --> 02:29:27.520
<v Speaker 1>like it just goes into shock and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't die like he has no idea how it </v>

3303
02:29:27.520 --> 02:29:31.811
<v Speaker 1>stayed alive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was alive for three fucking days </v>

3304
02:29:31.811 --> 02:29:34.510
<v Speaker 1>before they finally killed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they were just feeding off of it </v>

3305
02:29:34.510 --> 02:29:37.900
<v Speaker 1>while it was still alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And oftentimes they eat it from the ass </v>

3306
02:29:37.900 --> 02:29:37.900
<v Speaker 1>first.</v>

3307
02:29:37.900 --> 02:29:40.490
<v Speaker 1>For whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a natural instinct to take out</v>

3308
02:29:40.491 --> 02:29:43.580
<v Speaker 1>the back legs because the hamstring you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they take out the back legs,</v>

3309
02:29:43.581 --> 02:29:45.530
<v Speaker 1>you can't run away and then just start </v>
<v Speaker 1>eating you.</v>

3310
02:29:46.010 --> 02:29:51.010
<v Speaker 1>And so there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this crazy video of these two </v>

3311
02:29:51.010 --> 02:29:55.420
<v Speaker 1>deer that had gotten into a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were like clashing antlers </v>

3312
02:29:55.420 --> 02:29:56.660
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when they clashed antlers together,</v>

3313
02:29:56.870 --> 02:29:59.060
<v Speaker 1>they got stuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes this happens,</v>

3314
02:29:59.240 --> 02:30:01.640
<v Speaker 1>deer get stuck and they can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't get away and they're like,</v>

3315
02:30:01.880 --> 02:30:04.340
<v Speaker 1>they're moving around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their antlers are so interlocked,</v>

3316
02:30:04.370 --> 02:30:06.140
<v Speaker 1>they literally pulling apart and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't.</v>

3317
02:30:06.440 --> 02:30:10.760
<v Speaker 1>So the coyotes ate one of them while the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other one was still alive.</v>

3318
02:30:11.350 --> 02:30:16.350
<v Speaker 1>And so there's this video of these two </v>
<v Speaker 1>deer stuck together and one of the deer </v>

3319
02:30:16.350 --> 02:30:19.700
<v Speaker 1>is dead and these hunters had found it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it had asshole first.</v>

3320
02:30:19.790 --> 02:30:24.790
<v Speaker 1>So these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this pack of coyotes got ahold of the </v>

3321
02:30:24.790 --> 02:30:26.120
<v Speaker 1>one deer was eating it asshole first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while the other deer was like,</v>

3322
02:30:26.300 --> 02:30:31.100
<v Speaker 1>move in and flip and attached to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rest of the carcass is this deer.</v>

3323
02:30:31.730 --> 02:30:34.400
<v Speaker 1>So they finally went over and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>separated the two of them.</v>

3324
02:30:34.401 --> 02:30:39.401
<v Speaker 1>And then the one deer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they let them go and then they took </v>

3325
02:30:39.401 --> 02:30:39.530
<v Speaker 1>photos and videos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the deer that it was all fucked up,</v>

3326
02:30:39.531 --> 02:30:42.320
<v Speaker 1>but it had literally eating it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Asshole first.</v>

3327
02:30:42.380 --> 02:30:43.380
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

3328
02:30:43.430 --> 02:30:45.830
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the other deer is alive.</v>

3329
02:30:46.040 --> 02:30:47.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well this is happening.</v>

3330
02:30:47.570 --> 02:30:49.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck man.</v>

3331
02:30:49.610 --> 02:30:54.610
<v Speaker 1>Nature is a scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a bunch of coyotes in </v>

3332
02:30:54.610 --> 02:30:54.610
<v Speaker 1>Griffith Park.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah,</v>

3333
02:30:54.610 --> 02:30:55.400
<v Speaker 1>there are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see them running around all the time.</v>

3334
02:30:55.620 --> 02:30:57.380
<v Speaker 1>Be like they go into the neighborhoods </v>
<v Speaker 1>and stuff.</v>

3335
02:30:57.410 --> 02:30:58.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

3336
02:30:58.280 --> 02:30:59.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As long as they have food,</v>

3337
02:30:59.631 --> 02:31:00.780
<v Speaker 1>you're okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3338
02:31:01.100 --> 02:31:04.490
<v Speaker 1>But as soon as they run out of rabbits </v>
<v Speaker 1>and squirrels and shoot to kill and cats</v>

3339
02:31:04.610 --> 02:31:07.220
<v Speaker 1>and dogs and they start going into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>suburbs,</v>

3340
02:31:07.520 --> 02:31:10.940
<v Speaker 1>they start looking around for other shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>he buries too.</v>

3341
02:31:10.941 --> 02:31:14.570
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes he'll come across like coyote </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit that's filled with berries,</v>

3342
02:31:15.110 --> 02:31:15.500
<v Speaker 1>which I was.</v>

3343
02:31:15.550 --> 02:31:20.550
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that coyotes weren't </v>

3344
02:31:20.550 --> 02:31:20.550
<v Speaker 1>totally carnivores and I'd never heard </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3345
02:31:21.090 --> 02:31:26.090
<v Speaker 1>So just now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think you could eat a coyote if </v>

3346
02:31:26.090 --> 02:31:26.090
<v Speaker 1>you had to stay alive?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I had to.</v>

3347
02:31:26.090 --> 02:31:30.530
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like a lot of work though and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I really know how to do </v>

3348
02:31:30.530 --> 02:31:30.530
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do I have a knife?</v>

3349
02:31:30.620 --> 02:31:35.620
<v Speaker 1>How to kill it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mean I have a knife and do I have </v>

3350
02:31:35.620 --> 02:31:35.620
<v Speaker 1>fire one thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3351
02:31:35.620 --> 02:31:37.650
<v Speaker 1>you have fire and yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a knife because you have to gut</v>

3352
02:31:37.651 --> 02:31:38.320
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3353
02:31:38.470 --> 02:31:38.940
<v Speaker 1>Then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3354
02:31:38.941 --> 02:31:43.941
<v Speaker 1>I could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to cook it with the guts </v>

3355
02:31:43.941 --> 02:31:43.941
<v Speaker 1>in tact.</v>

3356
02:31:43.941 --> 02:31:44.100
<v Speaker 8>Hmm.</v>

3357
02:31:45.200 --> 02:31:45.810
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3358
02:31:45.830 --> 02:31:46.760
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you got to take,</v>

3359
02:31:46.770 --> 02:31:48.650
<v Speaker 1>you got gut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to skin it,</v>

3360
02:31:49.640 --> 02:31:51.770
<v Speaker 1>you got to cook it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the world of nature,</v>

3361
02:31:51.771 --> 02:31:56.771
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you've got to eat it and then </v>

3362
02:31:56.771 --> 02:31:56.771
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

3363
02:31:56.771 --> 02:31:56.771
<v Speaker 1>Then you got to do it again tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The full charge.</v>

3364
02:31:56.771 --> 02:31:56.771
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever thought about going </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting?</v>

3365
02:31:57.420 --> 02:31:59.330
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went hunting one time.</v>

3366
02:31:59.331 --> 02:32:01.350
<v Speaker 1>I shot a bird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What kind of,</v>

3367
02:32:01.950 --> 02:32:03.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you eat it?</v>

3368
02:32:04.110 --> 02:32:05.150
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was terrible.</v>

3369
02:32:05.151 --> 02:32:09.170
<v Speaker 1>It was a terrible thing to do and I felt</v>
<v Speaker 1>horrible and I moved on with my life.</v>

3370
02:32:09.171 --> 02:32:11.600
<v Speaker 1>It was a shotgun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bird had no chance whatsoever.</v>

3371
02:32:12.140 --> 02:32:15.080
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People say,</v>

3372
02:32:15.860 --> 02:32:18.530
<v Speaker 1>why don't you make it fair?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't.</v>

3373
02:32:18.531 --> 02:32:19.550
<v Speaker 1>We can't make it fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

3374
02:32:19.840 --> 02:32:22.220
<v Speaker 1>A beaver will kill you if you try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make it fair.</v>

3375
02:32:22.480 --> 02:32:24.140
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beaver will fuck you up.</v>

3376
02:32:24.560 --> 02:32:26.780
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't use your hands and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to like get on the ground trying to</v>

3377
02:32:26.781 --> 02:32:27.110
<v Speaker 1>bite it.</v>

3378
02:32:27.150 --> 02:32:29.780
<v Speaker 1>I think that the beaver will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they eat trees with their face,</v>

3379
02:32:30.310 --> 02:32:32.540
<v Speaker 1>how are you going to kick a beaver's </v>
<v Speaker 1>asked now you got to use a weapon.</v>

3380
02:32:32.570 --> 02:32:34.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to win.</v>

3381
02:32:34.490 --> 02:32:36.800
<v Speaker 1>There's no fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing's fair.</v>

3382
02:32:36.830 --> 02:32:38.600
<v Speaker 1>We should have fucking shotguns for this</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

3383
02:32:38.750 --> 02:32:43.750
<v Speaker 1>People want to like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This one thing that people want to say </v>

3384
02:32:43.750 --> 02:32:43.750
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't you make it fair?</v>

3385
02:32:43.750 --> 02:32:47.440
<v Speaker 1>To make it fair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would have to be like a 50 slash 50 </v>

3386
02:32:47.440 --> 02:32:48.470
<v Speaker 1>proposition that you would die and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the animal would kill you.</v>

3387
02:32:48.650 --> 02:32:50.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fifty slash 50.</v>

3388
02:32:50.120 --> 02:32:51.470
<v Speaker 1>The animal will die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 slash 50.</v>

3389
02:32:51.471 --> 02:32:53.960
<v Speaker 1>You would die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to happen.</v>

3390
02:32:53.961 --> 02:32:56.210
<v Speaker 1>Why would an animal is going to win?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would you do that?</v>

3391
02:32:56.600 --> 02:32:59.560
<v Speaker 1>That seems so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like such.</v>

3392
02:32:59.600 --> 02:33:04.600
<v Speaker 1>That's distorting what's going on </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we ultimate fighting with </v>

3393
02:33:04.600 --> 02:33:04.600
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are we eating them?</v>

3394
02:33:04.750 --> 02:33:05.630
<v Speaker 1>Like what's going on?</v>

3395
02:33:06.630 --> 02:33:09.260
<v Speaker 1>We're eating though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean do we have animal weight classes?</v>

3396
02:33:09.290 --> 02:33:14.290
<v Speaker 1>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we have to find out like what was </v>

3397
02:33:14.290 --> 02:33:15.470
<v Speaker 1>our will fuck up a 20 pound house cat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I get ahold of it,</v>

3398
02:33:15.860 --> 02:33:20.860
<v Speaker 1>it'll probably scratch me up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the bottom line is if I can get </v>

3399
02:33:20.860 --> 02:33:22.250
<v Speaker 1>ahold of it and get its back legs just </v>
<v Speaker 1>bashed his head on the ground,</v>

3400
02:33:22.580 --> 02:33:24.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to kill that cat most likely </v>
<v Speaker 1>with my hands.</v>

3401
02:33:25.130 --> 02:33:29.540
<v Speaker 1>But a 30 pound cat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he might fuck me up a 40 pound cat.</v>

3402
02:33:30.110 --> 02:33:32.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be really scared of 50 </v>
<v Speaker 1>pound cat will probably kill me.</v>

3403
02:33:32.990 --> 02:33:37.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fifty pound cat will most likely kill </v>

3404
02:33:37.990 --> 02:33:37.990
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you'd have to like for,</v>

3405
02:33:37.990 --> 02:33:41.670
<v Speaker 1>for fairness sake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to have like a 35 pound cat </v>

3406
02:33:41.670 --> 02:33:41.670
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3407
02:33:41.670 --> 02:33:45.980
<v Speaker 1>Or normal person do trust me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I tell you that I was scared of this</v>

3408
02:33:45.981 --> 02:33:49.220
<v Speaker 1>kitten that I had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Feral kitten.</v>

3409
02:33:50.720 --> 02:33:55.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when when the shit goes down and cats </v>

3410
02:33:55.720 --> 02:33:55.720
<v Speaker 1>are fighting for their lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a 30 pound,</v>

3411
02:33:56.000 --> 02:34:00.560
<v Speaker 1>35 pound cat will give you a beating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll look at that report or that video.</v>

3412
02:34:00.561 --> 02:34:02.940
<v Speaker 1>The reporter then they kept going up the</v>
<v Speaker 1>record,</v>

3413
02:34:02.960 --> 02:34:05.570
<v Speaker 1>his leg and two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll fuck you up man.</v>

3414
02:34:05.960 --> 02:34:07.760
<v Speaker 1>They live in a totally different world </v>
<v Speaker 1>of movement.</v>

3415
02:34:07.790 --> 02:34:09.980
<v Speaker 1>They live in a world of superhuman </v>
<v Speaker 1>athleticism.</v>

3416
02:34:09.981 --> 02:34:10.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3417
02:34:10.941 --> 02:34:15.941
<v Speaker 1>a 35 pound cat as a formidable foe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 five pound pit bull is a dangerous </v>

3418
02:34:15.941 --> 02:34:17.410
<v Speaker 1>little dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You versus a kangaroo fighting.</v>

3419
02:34:17.980 --> 02:34:21.070
<v Speaker 2>Trying to kick my ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kangaroo would kick my ass.</v>

3420
02:34:21.640 --> 02:34:26.640
<v Speaker 2>The only way I'd be able to beat a </v>
<v Speaker 2>kangaroo is if it didn't understand not </v>

3421
02:34:26.640 --> 02:34:26.640
<v Speaker 2>to give up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's back.</v>

3422
02:34:26.640 --> 02:34:30.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean if there's somehow or another </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I could scramble with the kangaroo,</v>

3477
02:36:51.541 --> 02:36:52.530
<v Speaker 2>Dead Kangaroo right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I get that position,</v>

3478
02:36:52.720 --> 02:36:54.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm throwing the hooks in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm riding his back.</v>

3479
02:36:55.070 --> 02:36:58.070
<v Speaker 2>He's not going to know what's up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll choke the shit out of a kangaroo.</v>

3480
02:36:59.500 --> 02:37:00.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I changed the position.</v>

3481
02:37:01.100 --> 02:37:03.470
<v Speaker 2>If I was that guy in the suit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm killing that kangaroo with my hands.</v>

3482
02:37:06.510 --> 02:37:08.150
<v Speaker 2>That's just how it's gone down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What can you do?</v>

3483
02:37:08.190 --> 02:37:10.430
<v Speaker 2>I would never be in that position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would never fucking buck.</v>

3484
02:37:10.431 --> 02:37:11.630
<v Speaker 2>I think it's cool as shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3485
02:37:11.670 --> 02:37:16.670
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that funny?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He such like known as such an </v>

3486
02:37:16.670 --> 02:37:16.670
<v Speaker 2>intellectual comedian that woody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3487
02:37:16.670 --> 02:37:20.561
<v Speaker 2>And then he just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then he just fights a kangaroo is a </v>

3488
02:37:20.561 --> 02:37:20.561
<v Speaker 2>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not his idea.</v>

3489
02:37:20.561 --> 02:37:20.810
<v Speaker 2>Obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might've been.</v>

3490
02:37:21.130 --> 02:37:22.300
<v Speaker 2>He was young.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I seems fake.</v>

3491
02:37:22.550 --> 02:37:24.410
<v Speaker 2>Piss and vinegar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like fun.</v>

3492
02:37:24.800 --> 02:37:26.060
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seems terrifying.</v>

3493
02:37:26.170 --> 02:37:30.050
<v Speaker 2>You Woody Allen moves pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty impressed.</v>

3494
02:37:30.080 --> 02:37:31.730
<v Speaker 2>I bet he boxed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really do.</v>

3495
02:37:31.790 --> 02:37:33.530
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's definitely into something.</v>

3496
02:37:33.530 --> 02:37:38.530
<v Speaker 2>The way he moved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's always talking about fights and </v>

3497
02:37:38.530 --> 02:37:38.660
<v Speaker 2>going to fights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't move like a,</v>

3498
02:37:38.661 --> 02:37:43.661
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's some guys that go to </v>

3499
02:37:43.661 --> 02:37:43.661
<v Speaker 2>boxercise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Bryan county goes to this place box</v>

3500
02:37:43.661 --> 02:37:47.951
<v Speaker 2>and burn going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get a lot of these executives that </v>

3501
02:37:47.951 --> 02:37:50.201
<v Speaker 2>have never barks a day in their life and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're in there at like drawing these </v>

3502
02:37:50.201 --> 02:37:52.250
<v Speaker 2>ridiculously uncoordinated punches and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's comical to watch.</v>

3503
02:37:53.090 --> 02:37:54.560
<v Speaker 2>But that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was not that.</v>

3504
02:37:54.590 --> 02:37:55.790
<v Speaker 2>Like the way he was moving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3505
02:37:55.820 --> 02:37:56.990
<v Speaker 2>He looked like he knew what he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

3506
02:37:57.140 --> 02:38:01.130
<v Speaker 2>Would you fight Woody Allen today?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A Yes for a lot of money or whatever.</v>

3507
02:38:01.490 --> 02:38:06.490
<v Speaker 2>How much?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much publicity stunt to fight woody </v>

3508
02:38:06.490 --> 02:38:06.740
<v Speaker 2>Allen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you fucked him up,</v>

3509
02:38:07.220 --> 02:38:08.150
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd back off.</v>

3510
02:38:08.151 --> 02:38:10.280
<v Speaker 2>There'd be a ref you back off if you had</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

3511
02:38:10.290 --> 02:38:15.290
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I were talking about like a boxing </v>

3512
02:38:15.290 --> 02:38:15.290
<v Speaker 2>match,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

3513
02:38:15.290 --> 02:38:15.290
<v Speaker 2>whatever you want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you want to do it?</v>

3514
02:38:15.290 --> 02:38:15.530
<v Speaker 2>You could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tom.</v>

3515
02:38:15.531 --> 02:38:17.180
<v Speaker 2>Post little funny looking glass and </v>
<v Speaker 2>rope.</v>

3516
02:38:18.810 --> 02:38:21.290
<v Speaker 2>Claude van Damme.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't want referees.</v>

3517
02:38:21.291 --> 02:38:26.291
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to be like a civil fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't wanna I wouldn't wanna beat </v>

3518
02:38:26.291 --> 02:38:28.070
<v Speaker 2>up with woody allen too bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like you're saying,</v>

3519
02:38:28.100 --> 02:38:33.100
<v Speaker 2>he looked like he knew what he was doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know what I'm doing so who </v>

3520
02:38:33.100 --> 02:38:33.100
<v Speaker 2>knows?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think I could take them,</v>

3521
02:38:33.100 --> 02:38:34.030
<v Speaker 2>but he's older now and I think we can </v>
<v Speaker 2>take them.</v>

3522
02:38:34.040 --> 02:38:36.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And pushed both the public shame.</v>

3523
02:38:36.071 --> 02:38:37.820
<v Speaker 2>There's experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably fuck with the psyche.</v>

3524
02:38:38.430 --> 02:38:41.750
<v Speaker 2>Like he doesn't deserve to win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would fight him for money,</v>

3525
02:38:41.751 --> 02:38:43.400
<v Speaker 2>but I wouldn't want to hurt him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like him.</v>

3526
02:38:43.940 --> 02:38:44.630
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's sweet.</v>

3527
02:38:44.660 --> 02:38:46.100
<v Speaker 2>Do you still like them even though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3528
02:38:46.101 --> 02:38:47.300
<v Speaker 2>he's kind of a creeper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3529
02:38:47.301 --> 02:38:50.570
<v Speaker 2>that really creeps me out actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I still kinda like his,</v>

3531
02:38:52.190 --> 02:38:53.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a weird thing with the guy like</v>

3532
02:38:53.451 --> 02:38:54.820
<v Speaker 2>woody Allen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3533
02:38:54.830 --> 02:38:57.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotta you still like Roman Polanski.</v>

3534
02:38:57.141 --> 02:39:02.141
<v Speaker 2>People still support him as an artist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you find out he drugged and </v>

3535
02:39:02.141 --> 02:39:02.300
<v Speaker 2>fucked a 13 year old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3536

<v Speaker 2>it's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What Rosemary's baby wasn't that good </v>

3537
02:39:07.310 --> 02:39:08.150
<v Speaker 2>that I'm fucking sticking up for Roman </v>
<v Speaker 2>Polanski,</v>

3538
02:39:08.151 --> 02:39:09.170
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But woody,</v>

3539
02:39:09.171 --> 02:39:10.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a greater connection to,</v>

3540
02:39:11.010 --> 02:39:13.670
<v Speaker 2>but I'm also completely grossed out by </v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea.</v>

3541
02:39:13.700 --> 02:39:18.700
<v Speaker 2>It's basically a step kid that he raised</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that's very strange where </v>

3542
02:39:18.700 --> 02:39:22.901
<v Speaker 2>there's an image of her sitting on his </v>
<v Speaker 2>lap as like a father figure or going to </v>

3543
02:39:22.901 --> 02:39:23.600
<v Speaker 2>a basketball game and then an image </v>
<v Speaker 2>later,</v>

3544
02:39:23.780 --> 02:39:25.790
<v Speaker 2>many years later was holding her hand as</v>
<v Speaker 2>a boyfriend,</v>

3545
02:39:25.791 --> 02:39:29.270
<v Speaker 2>girlfriend at a basketball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's really manipulative.</v>

3546
02:39:29.510 --> 02:39:30.230
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>100 percent.</v>

3547
02:39:30.860 --> 02:39:34.610
<v Speaker 2>But that's why I want to fight him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got it.</v>

3548
02:39:34.610 --> 02:39:39.610
<v Speaker 2>There's a great comedy album that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>downloaded accidentally that I thought </v>

3549
02:39:40.160 --> 02:39:42.740
<v Speaker 2>was a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have that phone anymore,</v>

3550
02:39:42.770 --> 02:39:47.770
<v Speaker 2>so I don't have it on me here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a great comedy album that I </v>

3551
02:39:47.770 --> 02:39:49.780
<v Speaker 2>downloaded that I thought was woody </v>
<v Speaker 2>Allen doing stand up.</v>

3552
02:39:49.820 --> 02:39:54.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it turned out to be woody Allen </v>

3553
02:39:54.820 --> 02:39:56.280
<v Speaker 2>giving an interview about standup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it was like woody Allen on Standup,</v>

3554
02:39:56.300 --> 02:39:59.240
<v Speaker 2>I think it's called and it's really </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting man,</v>

3555
02:39:59.241 --> 02:40:01.640
<v Speaker 2>because it sort of applies to stand up </v>
<v Speaker 2>today,</v>

3556
02:40:02.070 --> 02:40:07.070
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the ideas and the principles </v>
<v Speaker 2>and leverage these talking about </v>

3557
02:40:07.070 --> 02:40:08.240
<v Speaker 2>performers versus writers and what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>good and what's not good.</v>

3558
02:40:08.241 --> 02:40:10.220
<v Speaker 2>And it was really interesting man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was good man.</v>

3559
02:40:10.560 --> 02:40:15.560
<v Speaker 2>When I first started doing standup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody had like an open mic at the </v>

3560
02:40:15.560 --> 02:40:15.560
<v Speaker 2>coconut</v>

3561
02:40:15.560 --> 02:40:15.560
<v Speaker 4>teaser,</v>
<v Speaker 4>handed me a tape.</v>

3562
02:40:15.560 --> 02:40:18.450
<v Speaker 4>I had one side was bill Hicks dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the other side with some woody Allen</v>

3563
02:40:18.450 --> 02:40:22.150
<v Speaker 4>Stanhope record and it was a pretty good</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking tape that somebody handed him.</v>

3564
02:40:22.320 --> 02:40:22.830
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3565
02:40:22.831 --> 02:40:23.850
<v Speaker 4>It was not bad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

3566
02:40:23.910 --> 02:40:26.370
<v Speaker 4>I think this one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this one audio thing,</v>

3567
02:40:26.400 --> 02:40:31.400
<v Speaker 4>woody Allen on standup a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this one audio thing really should be </v>

3568
02:40:31.801 --> 02:40:33.380
<v Speaker 4>something that people should,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3569
02:40:34.710 --> 02:40:39.710
<v Speaker 4>should play,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a comics should play and listen to </v>

3570
02:40:39.710 --> 02:40:42.721
<v Speaker 4>it because just to get a historical </v>
<v Speaker 4>perspective of what it was like to be </v>

3571
02:40:42.721 --> 02:40:44.070
<v Speaker 4>kind of at the forefront.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3572
02:40:44.071 --> 02:40:47.970
<v Speaker 4>if you think about like you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about the early sixties.</v>

3573
02:40:48.110 --> 02:40:48.540
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3574
02:40:48.840 --> 02:40:50.880
<v Speaker 4>it was before it was the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3575
02:40:51.700 --> 02:40:56.040
<v Speaker 4>the people talk about stand up in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>seventies and was like when,</v>

3576
02:40:56.041 --> 02:40:59.040
<v Speaker 4>when it got crystallized as what standup</v>
<v Speaker 4>is today,</v>

3577
02:40:59.640 --> 02:41:01.080
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but those guys in the sixties,</v>

3578
02:41:01.081 --> 02:41:03.000
<v Speaker 4>like Woody Allen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he tells jokes,</v>

3579
02:41:03.001 --> 02:41:05.310
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's pretty similar to what happens now.</v>

3580
02:41:05.670 --> 02:41:09.660
<v Speaker 4>Go to woody Allen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stand up 65 rare.</v>

3583
02:41:15.190 --> 02:41:17.340
<v Speaker 4>Kangaroo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kangaroo may fight.</v>

3584

<v Speaker 4>There was movies that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can we scratch that guy up?</v>

3585
02:41:20.310 --> 02:41:20.970
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was.</v>

3587
02:41:24.150 --> 02:41:29.150
<v Speaker 4>Is this real?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a movie about a guy for a </v>

3588

<v Speaker 4>movie that's definitely breaks the legs.</v>

<v Speaker 4>movies,</v>

3591
02:41:37.441 --> 02:41:38.810
<v Speaker 4>I feel like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Came out in the eighties.</v>

3597
02:41:56.821 --> 02:41:58.860
<v Speaker 4>Stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sixty five rare.</v>

3598
02:41:58.890 --> 02:42:01.860
<v Speaker 4>It's a more subtle form of comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This woody Allen,</v>

3599
02:42:01.920 --> 02:42:06.840
<v Speaker 4>but it'll do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really good though.</v>

3600
02:42:06.990 --> 02:42:11.070
<v Speaker 4>It's really good to see like what comedy</v>
<v Speaker 4>was in 1965,</v>

3601
02:42:11.130 --> 02:42:16.130
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to see like this guy who is known more </v>

3602
02:42:16.130 --> 02:42:16.470
<v Speaker 4>of like as a film maker and play it a </v>
<v Speaker 4>little bit</v>

3603
02:42:16.940 --> 02:42:21.940
<v Speaker 6>and when I was younger I used to hang </v>
<v Speaker 6>out a lot the museum in search of a </v>

3604
02:42:21.940 --> 02:42:26.861
<v Speaker 6>meaningful social relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I used to look for girls.</v>

3605
02:42:29.170 --> 02:42:34.010
<v Speaker 6>We played this before the world was a </v>
<v Speaker 6>new group,</v>

3606
02:42:34.310 --> 02:42:39.310
<v Speaker 6>but our real succulent nude,</v>
<v Speaker 6>naked huntress stabbing to death,</v>

3607
02:42:41.541 --> 02:42:46.180
<v Speaker 6>a warthog and I got very emotionally </v>
<v Speaker 6>involved with the painting,</v>

3608
02:42:46.190 --> 02:42:49.040
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to God had to restrain me,</v>

3609
02:42:50.060 --> 02:42:52.100
<v Speaker 6>write the lyrics over the oil,</v>
<v Speaker 6>off the camera.</v>

3610
02:42:53.730 --> 02:42:58.730
<v Speaker 4>It's one of those things where like when</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know his history now it's kind of </v>

3611
02:42:58.730 --> 02:42:59.100
<v Speaker 4>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Washington talk about sex and perversion</v>

3612
02:42:59.101 --> 02:43:01.610
<v Speaker 4>and giving into indulgence and idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3613
02:43:01.620 --> 02:43:01.970
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

02:43:01.980 --> 02:43:02.340
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3615
02:43:02.341 --> 02:43:05.230
<v Speaker 4>he seems obsessed with sex.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But yeah.</v>

3616
02:43:06.510 --> 02:43:09.630
<v Speaker 4>It's also interesting though to see like</v>
<v Speaker 4>just how physically was.</v>

3617
02:43:09.650 --> 02:43:11.070
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not over the top,</v>

3618
02:43:11.080 --> 02:43:11.800
<v Speaker 4>but he's doing like</v>

3619
02:43:12.040 --> 02:43:15.490
<v Speaker 2>his tricks that he's obviously learned </v>
<v Speaker 2>to make people pay attention.</v>

3620
02:43:15.550 --> 02:43:16.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's moving around a lot.</v>

3621
02:43:16.900 --> 02:43:18.330
<v Speaker 2>That's a good way to put.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3622
02:43:18.580 --> 02:43:23.580
<v Speaker 2>dance moves because some dance moves and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he used to do like cafe wha and that he </v>

3623
02:43:24.821 --> 02:43:27.730
<v Speaker 2>used to do like those folk scene.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mike's really?</v>

3624
02:43:27.790 --> 02:43:28.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3625
02:43:28.441 --> 02:43:29.020
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3626
02:43:29.190 --> 02:43:30.490
<v Speaker 2>They'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does cafe wall.</v>

3627
02:43:30.520 --> 02:43:34.030
<v Speaker 2>It's like we're a Hendrix and dylan and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody played in the village.</v>

3628
02:43:34.120 --> 02:43:36.970
<v Speaker 2>Really share the stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joan rivers was there.</v>

3629
02:43:36.971 --> 02:43:38.670
<v Speaker 2>Bob Dylan was there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was nuts,</v>

3630
02:43:38.700 --> 02:43:43.700
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was this one venue where like people </v>

3631
02:43:43.700 --> 02:43:45.300
<v Speaker 2>tried out more artistic things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3632
02:43:45.490 --> 02:43:48.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's got to be really bizarre,</v>

3633
02:43:48.731 --> 02:43:49.740
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And do standup.</v>

3634
02:43:49.860 --> 02:43:52.600
<v Speaker 2>The intermixed with all these other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3635
02:43:52.770 --> 02:43:54.190
<v Speaker 2>because yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>standup wasn't.</v>

3636
02:43:54.670 --> 02:43:59.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there used to be shows </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you go see a whole standup show </v>

3637
02:43:59.670 --> 02:43:59.670
<v Speaker 2>back in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just part of the show.</v>

3638
02:43:59.830 --> 02:44:01.840
<v Speaker 2>That's why in Annie Hall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Woody Allen Goes,</v>

3639
02:44:02.110 --> 02:44:03.700
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to go on after a comedian.</v>

3640
02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:05.750
<v Speaker 2>You know why you have to be going on </v>
<v Speaker 2>after comedian.</v>

3641
02:44:05.980 --> 02:44:10.150
<v Speaker 2>Like that wasn't done back in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was more of a variety show thing.</v>

3642
02:44:10.180 --> 02:44:14.050
<v Speaker 2>Magicians jugglers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hat tricks and yeah,</v>

3643
02:44:14.260 --> 02:44:19.260
<v Speaker 2>in musicians and makes you realize like </v>
<v Speaker 2>how young stand up comedy really is all </v>

3644
02:44:20.460 --> 02:44:22.420
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all our forms of human expression.</v>

3645
02:44:22.660 --> 02:44:27.660
<v Speaker 2>Think about like films,</v>
<v Speaker 2>films only been around for 100 or so </v>

3646
02:44:27.660 --> 02:44:27.660
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3647
02:44:27.660 --> 02:44:27.970
<v Speaker 2>books,</v>
<v Speaker 2>books,</v>

3648
02:44:27.971 --> 02:44:32.971
<v Speaker 2>literature has only been around for 100 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years or something like that to people </v>

3649
02:44:32.971 --> 02:44:35.761
<v Speaker 2>and writing things down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's obviously written </v>

3650
02:44:35.761 --> 02:44:35.761
<v Speaker 2>language from way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

3651
02:44:35.761 --> 02:44:39.421
<v Speaker 2>way back in the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the cuneiform tablets and shit for </v>

3652
02:44:39.421 --> 02:44:39.421
<v Speaker 2>like 6,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>

02:44:39.421 --> 02:44:43.051
<v Speaker 2>But like how long has it been where </v>
<v Speaker 2>people have like acknowledged that with </v>

3654
02:44:43.051 --> 02:44:45.100
<v Speaker 2>their writing is bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this is fiction.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

3660
02:44:54.520 --> 02:44:59.520
<v Speaker 2>But not that long in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective of the age of the human </v>

3661
02:44:59.590 --> 02:45:01.690

<v Speaker 2>He put a meme generator on his own </v>
<v Speaker 2>website that said,</v>

<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

3685
02:45:59.470 --> 02:46:00.790
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

3691
02:46:12.561 --> 02:46:13.160
<v Speaker 2>seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 2>enough to construct a website is going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be like in tune with the Internet.</v>

<v Speaker 2>the bus,</v>

3697
02:46:27.830 --> 02:46:31.260
<v Speaker 2>but that person has to know what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck is going to happen.</v>

3698
02:46:31.340 --> 02:46:36.340
<v Speaker 2>Very attuned to the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You put a meme generator up after the </v>

3699
02:46:36.340 --> 02:46:38.660
<v Speaker 2>Hannibal burress video comes out and </v>
<v Speaker 2>after all these people are talking about</v>

02:46:46.170 --> 02:46:51.170
<v Speaker 2>Spatially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything's too funny and vicious at the </v>

3704
02:46:51.170 --> 02:46:54.131

<v Speaker 2>light.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

3706
02:46:54.131 --> 02:46:54.131
<v Speaker 2>If you're a drugging rapist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all bets are off,</v>

3707
02:46:54.131 --> 02:46:55.070
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

02:46:55.130 --> 02:46:59.780
<v Speaker 2>But it's Cosby cosby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

3709
02:46:59.781 --> 02:47:02.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a weird almost epilogue.</v>

3710
02:47:02.900 --> 02:47:05.930
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say his career's over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a weird,</v>

3711
02:47:07.340 --> 02:47:09.890
<v Speaker 2>he said such a long career.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a weird thing to be happening at</v>

3712
02:47:09.891 --> 02:47:10.550
<v Speaker 2>the last minute.</v>

3713
02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:16.000
<v Speaker 2>It's not just the last minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was clear the last minute of his </v>

3714
02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:16.000
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3715
02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:19.551
<v Speaker 2>And if it was only like dementia and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>was doing things recently and you get </v>

3716
02:47:19.551 --> 02:47:19.640
<v Speaker 2>attributed to like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well there's something wrong with them,</v>

3717
02:47:19.880 --> 02:47:24.880
<v Speaker 2>but then these people coming out with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the stories that he's been doing this </v>

3718
02:47:24.880 --> 02:47:24.880
<v Speaker 2>since the seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3719
02:47:24.880 --> 02:47:26.390
<v Speaker 2>And as late as 2004.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So after the cosby show.</v>

3720
02:47:28.070 --> 02:47:31.160
<v Speaker 2>Damn Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it,</v>

3721
02:47:31.161 --> 02:47:36.161
<v Speaker 2>man?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That goes on in a person's brain that </v>

3722
02:47:36.161 --> 02:47:39.881
<v Speaker 2>makes them completely disconnect from </v>
<v Speaker 2>humanity that makes them just be able </v>

3723
02:47:39.881 --> 02:47:43.931
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fame can get you their candidate fame </v>

3724
02:47:43.931 --> 02:47:43.931
<v Speaker 2>and money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you think that's it?</v>

3725
02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:45.330
<v Speaker 2>That's all it takes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

3726
02:47:45.370 --> 02:47:48.140
<v Speaker 2>Drugging women and raping them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3727
02:47:48.141 --> 02:47:53.060
<v Speaker 2>but I think it can help you feel like </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're above the law or you're entitled.</v>

3728
02:47:53.510 --> 02:47:54.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it can,</v>

3729
02:47:54.830 --> 02:47:56.840
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rich privilege.</v>

3730
02:47:57.260 --> 02:47:59.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Black privilege.</v>

3731
02:47:59.650 --> 02:48:02.500
<v Speaker 2>Now I can't say that Black Gypsy </v>
<v Speaker 2>privilege.</v>

3732
02:48:02.501 --> 02:48:03.380
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't say that.</v>

3733
02:48:04.160 --> 02:48:05.480
<v Speaker 2>Can't say any of those things you just </v>
<v Speaker 2>said.</v>

3734
02:48:07.550 --> 02:48:09.590
<v Speaker 2>Giving famous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kind of make you go a little crazy.</v>

3735
02:48:09.591 --> 02:48:14.591
<v Speaker 2>Too famous too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely can make you go crazy and </v>

3736
02:48:14.591 --> 02:48:14.660
<v Speaker 2>famous can definitely make you think </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're different from other people.</v>

3737
02:48:14.690 --> 02:48:16.670
<v Speaker 2>Especially if you get fame when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>young.</v>

3738
02:48:16.671 --> 02:48:21.671
<v Speaker 2>I think when you live like all </v>
<v Speaker 2>throughout your puberty and adulthood,</v>

3739
02:48:21.970 --> 02:48:22.580
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

3740
02:48:22.730 --> 02:48:24.260
<v Speaker 2>everywhere you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People Kissing your ass.</v>

3741
02:48:24.410 --> 02:48:29.410
<v Speaker 2>Your idea of how you interact with </v>
<v Speaker 2>people is you will literally think of </v>

3742
02:48:29.410 --> 02:48:29.850
<v Speaker 2>yourself as being like royalty or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

3743
02:48:29.890 --> 02:48:31.820
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can't there be a lot of suppressed anger</v>

3744
02:48:31.850 --> 02:48:34.700
<v Speaker 2>with someone like bill cosby too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he,</v>

3745
02:48:34.790 --> 02:48:37.850
<v Speaker 2>he had to um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be a very like,</v>

3746
02:48:37.851 --> 02:48:42.851
<v Speaker 2>friendly black entertainer for like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of white audiences even though </v>

3747
02:48:42.851 --> 02:48:43.520
<v Speaker 2>probably a lot of the venues he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>playing,</v>

3748
02:48:43.521 --> 02:48:45.620
<v Speaker 2>they wouldn't even let him go in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dressing room and shit.</v>

3749
02:48:45.890 --> 02:48:50.890
<v Speaker 2>Like there could be a lot of suppressed </v>
<v Speaker 2>anger from someone that had to go </v>

3750
02:48:50.890 --> 02:48:51.530
<v Speaker 2>through something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's possible.</v>

3751
02:48:51.590 --> 02:48:54.080
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>since the 19 eighties,</v>

3752
02:48:54.540 --> 02:48:55.790
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3753
02:48:55.820 --> 02:48:59.030
<v Speaker 2>It's like you've got to feel like that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>a long time to harbor a grudge.</v>

3754
02:48:59.150 --> 02:49:00.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But 34,</v>

3755
02:49:00.830 --> 02:49:05.140
<v Speaker 2>35 years of like undeniable success.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3756
02:49:05.540 --> 02:49:10.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many years has he been super </v>

3757
02:49:10.540 --> 02:49:10.540
<v Speaker 2>successful for?</v>

3758
02:49:10.540 --> 02:49:10.890
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd say since at least the seventies.</v>

3759
02:49:10.891 --> 02:49:14.010
<v Speaker 1>Probably the sixties and all throughout </v>
<v Speaker 1>the eighties.</v>

3760
02:49:14.011 --> 02:49:19.011
<v Speaker 1>When I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we played that Noah's ark thing like </v>

3761
02:49:19.011 --> 02:49:20.100
<v Speaker 1>Noah and talking to God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We played that when I was a little kid.</v>

3762
02:49:20.101 --> 02:49:21.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know Noah,</v>

3763
02:49:22.940 --> 02:49:27.940
<v Speaker 1>what God right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was.</v>

3764
02:49:28.670 --> 02:49:33.670
<v Speaker 1>That was a great bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a great bit and we played that </v>

3765
02:49:33.670 --> 02:49:34.410
<v Speaker 1>on a record.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like a fucking album.</v>

3766
02:49:36.410 --> 02:49:38.340
<v Speaker 1>We'd sit there with the headphones on </v>
<v Speaker 1>and listen to that.</v>

3767
02:49:38.490 --> 02:49:43.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy just doesn't seem right that </v>

3768
02:49:43.490 --> 02:49:46.971
<v Speaker 1>that guy was the rapist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like the sweaters alone are </v>

3769
02:49:46.971 --> 02:49:48.300
<v Speaker 1>enough to make you think that's not a </v>
<v Speaker 1>rapist.</v>

3770
02:49:48.330 --> 02:49:53.330
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One thing that kind of leads me in that </v>

3771
02:49:53.330 --> 02:49:56.061
<v Speaker 1>direction besides all the obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that he always into like people being</v>

3772
02:49:56.701 --> 02:50:01.701
<v Speaker 1>clean and always into like yelling at </v>
<v Speaker 1>comics for using dirty word pressing.</v>

3773
02:50:02.670 --> 02:50:04.740
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember like the whole Eddie </v>
<v Speaker 1>Murphy thing?</v>

3774
02:50:04.830 --> 02:50:05.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I called up,</v>

3775
02:50:05.821 --> 02:50:08.730
<v Speaker 1>Richard just said I have a coconut smile</v>
<v Speaker 1>and shut the fuck up.</v>

3776
02:50:09.030 --> 02:50:10.230
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did,</v>

3777
02:50:10.410 --> 02:50:15.410
<v Speaker 1>did the audience laugh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you get paid to have a coconut smile</v>

3778
02:50:16.561 --> 02:50:21.561
<v Speaker 1>and shut the fuck up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mean that was Richard Pryor given </v>

3779
02:50:21.561 --> 02:50:23.100
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Murphy advice in which apparently </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a real conversation.</v>

3780
02:50:23.110 --> 02:50:24.720
<v Speaker 1>The next time he calls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell him I said,</v>

3781
02:50:24.721 --> 02:50:25.040
<v Speaker 1>suck</v>

3782
02:50:31.780 --> 02:50:34.000
<v Speaker 1>you gotta think like if a comic called </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

3783
02:50:34.260 --> 02:50:39.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like say if like Jerry Seinfeld called </v>

3784
02:50:39.260 --> 02:50:40.090
<v Speaker 1>you up and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

3785
02:50:40.630 --> 02:50:41.950
<v Speaker 1>you're very funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3786
02:50:42.020 --> 02:50:44.140
<v Speaker 1>All you're doing is wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3787
02:50:44.141 --> 02:50:47.800
<v Speaker 1>you're always seeing you out there on </v>
<v Speaker 1>stage and talking about your Dick.</v>

3788
02:50:47.880 --> 02:50:48.910
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stopped doing it.</v>

3789
02:50:49.270 --> 02:50:51.370
<v Speaker 1>You're making white America look bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3790
02:50:51.790 --> 02:50:54.100
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine if someone came up to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you and was like,</v>

3791
02:50:54.250 --> 02:50:56.170
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>

3792
02:50:56.171 --> 02:51:00.040
<v Speaker 1>I think Eddie was like kind of confused </v>
<v Speaker 1>now that you're doing this to me.</v>

3793
02:51:00.400 --> 02:51:01.440
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

3794
02:51:01.640 --> 02:51:03.640
<v Speaker 1>is he right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he's right or not.</v>

3795
02:51:03.641 --> 02:51:06.160
<v Speaker 1>Let me call Richard Skinner you to stop </v>
<v Speaker 1>swearing.</v>

3796
02:51:06.170 --> 02:51:11.170
<v Speaker 1>Mediamath Eddie Murphy back then was um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so far like during delirious when he </v>

3797
02:51:12.011 --> 02:51:15.040
<v Speaker 1>would go on stage with that fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>leather suit on and shit.</v>

3798
02:51:15.041 --> 02:51:16.870
<v Speaker 1>And Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so funny man.</v>

3799
02:51:16.900 --> 02:51:20.200
<v Speaker 1>He was like the original arena comic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3800
02:51:20.201 --> 02:51:25.201
<v Speaker 1>he was doing back then and to get a call</v>
<v Speaker 1>from bill cosby telling you to stop </v>

3801
02:51:27.161 --> 02:51:27.820
<v Speaker 1>being dirty.</v>

3802
02:51:28.060 --> 02:51:33.060
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a little jealousy in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and I think there's a little bit </v>

3803
02:51:33.060 --> 02:51:33.060
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3804
02:51:33.060 --> 02:51:34.210
<v Speaker 1>things are changing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I better try to slow them down part.</v>

3805
02:51:34.990 --> 02:51:39.150
<v Speaker 1>Or he had this idea in his head that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>just immobile.</v>

3806
02:51:39.630 --> 02:51:41.560
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dirty is bad and eat.</v>

3807
02:51:42.020 --> 02:51:47.020
<v Speaker 1>There's so many people that still think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that like that's an easy way out or </v>

3808
02:51:47.020 --> 02:51:47.020
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

3809
02:51:47.500 --> 02:51:50.140
<v Speaker 1>it's like saying rock and rock and roll </v>
<v Speaker 1>music is not,</v>

3810
02:51:50.350 --> 02:51:55.350
<v Speaker 1>it's not the way to go in all the drums </v>
<v Speaker 1>and heavy bass and classical music is </v>

3811
02:51:55.350 --> 02:51:57.400
<v Speaker 1>where it's at now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Classical music,</v>

3812
02:51:57.730 --> 02:52:00.430
<v Speaker 1>classical music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dirty comedy is comedy.</v>

3813
02:52:00.480 --> 02:52:02.880
<v Speaker 1>So it's like there's this kind of comedy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those,</v>

3814
02:52:02.890 --> 02:52:07.890
<v Speaker 1>that kind of comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is comedy that's clean but fucking </v>

3815
02:52:07.890 --> 02:52:07.960
<v Speaker 1>hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Hedberg,</v>

3816
02:52:08.110 --> 02:52:09.670
<v Speaker 1>Mitch Hedberg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>squeaky clean.</v>

3817
02:52:10.060 --> 02:52:14.560
<v Speaker 1>Almost all of his jokes were clean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>still unbelievably fucking hilarious.</v>

3818
02:52:15.370 --> 02:52:20.370
<v Speaker 1>So funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's Joey Diaz who's never </v>

3819
02:52:20.370 --> 02:52:23.461
<v Speaker 1>done a clean set ever in his life and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes me laugh harder than any person </v>

3820
02:52:23.461 --> 02:52:24.460
<v Speaker 1>that's ever walked the face of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

3821
02:52:24.880 --> 02:52:26.740
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just comedy,</v>

3822
02:52:26.741 --> 02:52:27.530
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3823
02:52:28.510 --> 02:52:30.310
<v Speaker 1>So if a guy like bill crosby calls you </v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

3824
02:52:31.300 --> 02:52:32.700
<v Speaker 1>fucks with you like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3825
02:52:35.000 --> 02:52:37.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile it was a chick tied to his bed</v>

3826
02:52:37.640 --> 02:52:42.640
<v Speaker 1>and he's talking to Eddie Murphy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You hear in the background mark,</v>

3827
02:52:43.120 --> 02:52:45.820
<v Speaker 1>good to you later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Deb.</v>

3828
02:52:45.821 --> 02:52:48.650
<v Speaker 1>Barb it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jello pudding.</v>

3829
02:52:51.540 --> 02:52:52.390
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't he?</v>

3830
02:52:52.391 --> 02:52:56.380
<v Speaker 1>By the little rascals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He bought the little rascals and stopped</v>

3831
02:52:56.381 --> 02:52:58.840
<v Speaker 1>it from ever being distributed because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was so racist.</v>

3832
02:52:59.570 --> 02:53:01.430
<v Speaker 4>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Didn't Michael Jackson do something like</v>

3833
02:53:01.431 --> 02:53:03.530
<v Speaker 4>that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Also wasn't little rascals,</v>

3834
02:53:03.531 --> 02:53:07.370
<v Speaker 4>but Michael Jackson did something very </v>
<v Speaker 4>similar where he bought good times,</v>

3835
02:53:07.371 --> 02:53:08.630
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was it good times?</v>

3836
02:53:08.690 --> 02:53:09.560
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so.</v>

3837
02:53:10.780 --> 02:53:15.010
<v Speaker 1>I think you're thinking of the Beatles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He bought the Beatles music,</v>

3838
02:53:15.300 --> 02:53:20.300
<v Speaker 1>the Beatles music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just butchering history and then </v>

3839
02:53:20.300 --> 02:53:20.300
<v Speaker 1>you put it in a nike commercial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember that?</v>

3840
02:53:20.300 --> 02:53:21.220
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Snipes.</v>

3841
02:53:21.250 --> 02:53:23.920
<v Speaker 1>It might be a snopes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rather it says it might not be true.</v>

3842
02:53:23.921 --> 02:53:25.530
<v Speaker 1>It's false.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3843
02:53:25.531 --> 02:53:28.450
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bill cosby bought the rights,</v>

3844
02:53:28.460 --> 02:53:33.460
<v Speaker 1>the little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the little rascals or our gang comedies </v>

3845
02:53:33.460 --> 02:53:35.770
<v Speaker 1>or to keep them off television because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they depict racial stereotypes,</v>

3846
02:53:35.771 --> 02:53:37.660
<v Speaker 1>false spanky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alfalfa,</v>

3847
02:53:37.661 --> 02:53:38.620
<v Speaker 1>buckwheat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Darla,</v>

3848
02:53:38.621 --> 02:53:43.621
<v Speaker 1>just a few of the easily recognizable </v>
<v Speaker 1>names that were found were fond part of </v>

3849
02:53:43.621 --> 02:53:45.460
<v Speaker 1>the childhoods of generations of kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck?</v>

3850
02:53:45.461 --> 02:53:47.800
<v Speaker 1>Why aren't they on TV?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In 1989,</v>

3851
02:53:47.810 --> 02:53:52.810
<v Speaker 1>the began circulating the entertainer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill cosby had bought up the rights a </v>

3852
02:53:52.810 --> 02:53:54.340
<v Speaker 1>little rascals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla.</v>

3853
02:53:55.240 --> 02:53:56.350
<v Speaker 1>Nothing to do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

3854
02:53:56.351 --> 02:54:01.351
<v Speaker 1>king world productions has owned and </v>
<v Speaker 1>licensed the rights to little rascals </v>

3855
02:54:01.351 --> 02:54:04.921
<v Speaker 1>for over 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This series has been syndicated </v>

3856
02:54:04.921 --> 02:54:06.970
<v Speaker 1>television many times in the video </v>
<v Speaker 1>rights to some episodes were licensed to</v>

3857
02:54:06.971 --> 02:54:08.950
<v Speaker 1>cabin fever entertainment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen 97.</v>

3858
02:54:08.951 --> 02:54:12.580
<v Speaker 1>So bill cosby has never owned any part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the right to little rascals.</v>

3859
02:54:14.660 --> 02:54:16.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So who the fuck owns that shit?</v>

3860
02:54:16.720 --> 02:54:20.680
<v Speaker 1>Cosby was one of the prominent names who</v>
<v Speaker 1>campaign to pressure CBS,</v>

3861
02:54:20.700 --> 02:54:25.540
<v Speaker 1>do withdrawing Amos and andy from </v>
<v Speaker 1>syndication back in the 19 sixties.</v>

3862
02:54:25.570 --> 02:54:27.430
<v Speaker 1>My mom loved that show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amos and Andy,</v>

3863
02:54:28.780 --> 02:54:29.560
<v Speaker 1>did she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3864
02:54:29.690 --> 02:54:31.110
<v Speaker 1>did she yell racial?</v>

3865
02:54:31.620 --> 02:54:32.410
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3866
02:54:32.460 --> 02:54:37.460
<v Speaker 4>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there wasn't a lot of racism in the </v>

3867
02:54:37.460 --> 02:54:37.460
<v Speaker 4>house,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but to facts name the cat,</v>

3868
02:54:37.460 --> 02:54:40.881
<v Speaker 4>sambo and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>said she liked Amos and Andy and even </v>

3869
02:54:40.881 --> 02:54:41.780
<v Speaker 4>used to do the voice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where'd you grow up?</v>

3870
02:54:42.170 --> 02:54:45.060
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I grew up in southern Maryland but she's</v>

3871
02:54:45.061 --> 02:54:47.010
<v Speaker 4>from New Jersey and that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I swear to God,</v>

3872
02:54:47.220 --> 02:54:49.080
<v Speaker 4>these things I'm bringing it up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>make it sound crazy.</v>

3873
02:54:49.260 --> 02:54:54.150
<v Speaker 4>But these are like two isolated </v>
<v Speaker 4>incidences that never really added up to</v>

3874
02:54:54.151 --> 02:54:56.220
<v Speaker 4>much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I remember them because there was so</v>

3875
02:54:56.221 --> 02:54:59.430
<v Speaker 4>weird and out of place in my household.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What made you become a comic?</v>

3876
02:54:59.580 --> 02:55:01.250
<v Speaker 4>What went wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

3877
02:55:01.251 --> 02:55:02.160
<v Speaker 4>I dunno,</v>
