<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.880
<v Speaker 2>So you were just two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One.</v>

4
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:09.710
<v Speaker 2>Hello?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Peter Schiff.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Hello Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just what we're going to,</v>

6
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.500
<v Speaker 2>we're going to ask.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just did a whole other show before </v>

7
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:16.500
<v Speaker 2>this one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did three hours.</v>

8
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.180
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two hours.</v>

9
00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:17.920
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>alright.</v>

10
00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:18.880
<v Speaker 2>So it's not hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

11
00:00:18.881 --> 00:00:19.970
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well the comedian,</v>

12
00:00:19.971 --> 00:00:21.070
<v Speaker 2>those are the easy ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

13
00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.570
<v Speaker 2>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just basically talking to a friend.</v>

14
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:24.860
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I'm a friend.</v>

15
00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.180
<v Speaker 2>You are a friend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

16
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember when I first saw you when you</v>

17
00:00:28.611 --> 00:00:31.340
<v Speaker 2>were doing that octopus is occupied Wall</v>
<v Speaker 2>Street thing anymore.</v>

18
00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.080
<v Speaker 2>Did they give up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They stop occupying?</v>

19
00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they did.</v>

20
00:00:34.041 --> 00:00:34.910
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just.</v>

21
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.100
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you saw that on my youtube </v>
<v Speaker 2>channel.</v>

22
00:00:37.101 --> 00:00:40.550
<v Speaker 2>I know we just reposting the occupy Wall</v>
<v Speaker 2>Street video.</v>

23
00:00:40.551 --> 00:00:42.910
<v Speaker 2>I never actually had it on my channel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>

24
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.820
<v Speaker 2>But because it was originally done by </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason this about five years ago or so,</v>

25
00:00:46.821 --> 00:00:51.821
<v Speaker 2>five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six years ago and so reason tv did it </v>

26
00:00:51.821 --> 00:00:52.100
<v Speaker 2>and so I let them promote it on their </v>
<v Speaker 2>site.</v>

27
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.100
<v Speaker 2>I didn't copy it and they got millions </v>
<v Speaker 2>and millions of views and there was some</v>

28
00:00:55.101 --> 00:00:59.680
<v Speaker 2>other sites that that that went with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was asking a one percenter,</v>

29
00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.100
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't that what you called it?</v>

30
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.730
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was down there with a sign that said I</v>

31
00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:06.380
<v Speaker 2>am the one percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's talk,</v>

32
00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.860
<v Speaker 2>and I went into Zucotti Park and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>only reason I stopped that if you the </v>

33
00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:12.740
<v Speaker 2>long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the long one,</v>

34
00:01:12.741 --> 00:01:14.600
<v Speaker 2>the long version is just under two </v>
<v Speaker 2>hours,</v>

35
00:01:14.601 --> 00:01:19.601
<v Speaker 2>which is on my youtube channel now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the other reason we stopped is </v>

36
00:01:19.601 --> 00:01:21.710
<v Speaker 2>because we ran out a ca,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a candidate batteries,</v>

37
00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.420
<v Speaker 2>batteries in the camera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The camera died,</v>

38
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.120
<v Speaker 2>but I could have kept talking and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>were losing the light.</v>

39
00:01:26.121 --> 00:01:27.880
<v Speaker 2>You can see by the end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know it's getting dark.</v>

40
00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.740
<v Speaker 2>It's getting darker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Swatching them get frustrated with you,</v>

41
00:01:30.741 --> 00:01:35.741
<v Speaker 2>but not having the words nor the </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge to compete with what you were </v>

42
00:01:35.741 --> 00:01:39.401
<v Speaker 2>saying was very entertaining,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like agree with you or disagree with </v>

43
00:01:39.401 --> 00:01:39.401
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

44
00:01:39.401 --> 00:01:43.210
<v Speaker 2>It was just hilarious watching someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>so completely outmatched or a group of </v>

45
00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.291
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so completely outmatched trying to </v>

46
00:01:47.291 --> 00:01:47.300
<v Speaker 2>debate economics with you and trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand the way business works,</v>

47
00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.690
<v Speaker 2>except they didn't even realize they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were out match.</v>

48
00:01:49.691 --> 00:01:51.980
<v Speaker 2>They thought they were smarter than me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

49
00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.240
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the main reason I went there was not so </v>

50
00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.120
<v Speaker 2>much to try to convince the people there</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they were wrong and that,</v>

51
00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>capitalism was,</v>

52
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the solution,</v>

53
00:02:01.521 --> 00:02:06.521
<v Speaker 2>not the source of their problems and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they should be protesting </v>

54
00:02:06.521 --> 00:02:07.430
<v Speaker 2>Washington,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Federal Reserve or Congress.</v>

55
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.700
<v Speaker 2>It was for the people that I knew that </v>
<v Speaker 2>would watch it on the internet and I </v>

56
00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.871
<v Speaker 2>still get emails even now at least I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't think a week goes by where </v>

57
00:02:16.871 --> 00:02:20.810
<v Speaker 2>somebody from somewhere in the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't send me an email about that.</v>

58
00:02:20.811 --> 00:02:24.020
<v Speaker 2>And I know another website,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget the name of it,</v>

59
00:02:24.021 --> 00:02:27.410
<v Speaker 2>re posted it about a year ago and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>got a couple of million views on it.</v>

60
00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.310
<v Speaker 2>Just posting it again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of people have watched it and I</v>

61
00:02:31.311 --> 00:02:34.550
<v Speaker 2>get comments from people saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what changed me.</v>

62
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.370
<v Speaker 2>I was socialist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very left wing.</v>

63
00:02:37.371 --> 00:02:39.500
<v Speaker 2>I watched this and that was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>epiphany.</v>

64
00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.680
<v Speaker 2>That was the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I did more research and I </v>

65
00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.051
<v Speaker 2>learned more and now thanks to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a total libertarian or free market </v>

66
00:02:47.051 --> 00:02:48.560
<v Speaker 2>capitalist and so it's served its </v>
<v Speaker 2>purpose.</v>

67
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it was enlightening.</v>

68
00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.830
<v Speaker 2>It was good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's good to see people that are so </v>

69
00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.070
<v Speaker 2>involved in something that they'll go </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they'll protest will hang out in the</v>

70
00:02:58.071 --> 00:03:00.610
<v Speaker 2>park,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they can't articulate their feelings</v>

71
00:03:00.611 --> 00:03:03.790
<v Speaker 2>or their thoughts in a well reasoned </v>
<v Speaker 2>debate.</v>

72
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.060
<v Speaker 2>They really don't have the facts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yet they're dedicating their entire </v>

73
00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.120
<v Speaker 2>life to protesting something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really interesting that people will</v>

74
00:03:10.121 --> 00:03:15.121
<v Speaker 2>spend so much energy and effort on </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that they're really not even </v>

75
00:03:15.121 --> 00:03:15.121
<v Speaker 2>educated.</v>

76
00:03:15.121 --> 00:03:16.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's a lot easier just to talk about</v>

77
00:03:16.901 --> 00:03:21.901
<v Speaker 2>something just emotionally instead of </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually taking the time to learn about </v>

78
00:03:23.921 --> 00:03:26.430
<v Speaker 2>economics and to understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

79
00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.070
<v Speaker 2>the source of the problems because </v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody could just blame it on some rich</v>

80
00:03:30.071 --> 00:03:32.930
<v Speaker 2>person who's hoarding money and </v>
<v Speaker 2>discriminating.</v>

81
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.560
<v Speaker 2>They loved doing that and then just say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

82
00:03:35.561 --> 00:03:40.561
<v Speaker 2>this solution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see if you blame the problems on some </v>

83
00:03:40.561 --> 00:03:40.561
<v Speaker 2>rich person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

84
00:03:40.561 --> 00:03:41.140
<v Speaker 2>the solution is easy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just take his money,</v>

85
00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.910
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have the government come in and,</v>

86
00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.720
<v Speaker 2>and redistribute the wealth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is another word for steel.</v>

87
00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.930
<v Speaker 2>Take money from somebody who earned it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and give it to somebody who didn't,</v>

88
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.730
<v Speaker 2>but if you actually take a little bit of</v>
<v Speaker 2>time and use your head instead of your,</v>

89
00:03:54.731 --> 00:03:55.180
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

90
00:03:55.181 --> 00:03:56.320
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your heart,</v>

91
00:03:56.321 --> 00:03:57.670
<v Speaker 2>your feelings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

92
00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.730
<v Speaker 2>you'll learn that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the source of the problems is </v>

93
00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.971
<v Speaker 2>government interference in the economy </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that the protest should be directed </v>

94
00:04:06.311 --> 00:04:09.550
<v Speaker 2>at government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at their regulations and their subsidies</v>

95
00:04:09.551 --> 00:04:14.551
<v Speaker 2>and their taxes and all the things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>government does to stifle economic </v>

96
00:04:14.551 --> 00:04:16.240
<v Speaker 2>growth and deny opportunities to people.</v>

97
00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.120
<v Speaker 2>I think that would be a really funny </v>
<v Speaker 2>documentary if you could do like a </v>

98
00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.521
<v Speaker 2>documentary on the last occupier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the last person to occupy Wall </v>

99
00:04:26.521 --> 00:04:28.570
<v Speaker 2>Street because they had to be like </v>
<v Speaker 2>stragglers,</v>

100
00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.660
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eventually must have gotten to the point</v>

101
00:04:31.661 --> 00:04:35.050
<v Speaker 2>where there was like 30 people left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 people left that one guy,</v>

102
00:04:35.051 --> 00:04:36.350
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck these people man.</v>

103
00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.820
<v Speaker 2>They started occupying different areas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

104
00:04:39.821 --> 00:04:41.860
<v Speaker 2>Because it caught on and it was all over</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

105
00:04:41.861 --> 00:04:45.310
<v Speaker 2>They were occupying here and occupying </v>
<v Speaker 2>there and they were setting up camps.</v>

106
00:04:45.311 --> 00:04:46.540
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're essentially living there.</v>

107
00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:47.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

108
00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.650
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows what else they were doing </v>

109
00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.650
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

110
00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.860
<v Speaker 2>but now the occupy a movement kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>morphed into the Bernie Sanders </v>

111
00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.860
<v Speaker 2>Movement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

112
00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:56.890
<v Speaker 2>Because that's where all those guys are </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

113
00:04:56.891 --> 00:05:01.550
<v Speaker 2>They were volunteering for the sanders </v>
<v Speaker 2>campaign and socialism is really kind of</v>

114
00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:06.570
<v Speaker 2>going mainstream now because they put </v>
<v Speaker 2>the word Democrat in front of it as if </v>

115
00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.790
<v Speaker 2>somehow that changes the meeting.</v>

116
00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:08.200
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a socialist.</v>

117
00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:13.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm a democratic socialist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meaning I want to vote for socialism as </v>

118
00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:14.680
<v Speaker 2>opposed to just have an armed </v>
<v Speaker 2>revolution.</v>

119
00:05:14.681 --> 00:05:16.720
<v Speaker 2>But the end is still the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

120
00:05:16.721 --> 00:05:18.820
<v Speaker 2>It's still a socialism and it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>

121
00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:24.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was watching an interview with Tucker </v>

122
00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:24.370
<v Speaker 2>Carlson and some guidance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a professor at Harvard and he said,</v>

123
00:05:24.371 --> 00:05:26.950
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you the last word you guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>said socialism is gonna win.</v>

124
00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.440
<v Speaker 2>I made the piece on like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is that?</v>

125
00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.920
<v Speaker 2>What does that even mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like socialism is going to win.</v>

126
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:34.330
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>

127
00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.360
<v Speaker 2>What is socialism?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it could win at the polls.</v>

128
00:05:37.361 --> 00:05:42.361
<v Speaker 2>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very intoxicating to people who </v>

129
00:05:42.361 --> 00:05:43.290
<v Speaker 2>don't know any better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the interesting thing people,</v>

130
00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.210
<v Speaker 2>they have too much money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The interesting thing about socialism is</v>

131
00:05:46.211 --> 00:05:49.930
<v Speaker 2>that no matter how many times it fails,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people expect it to succeed,</v>

132
00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.330
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the definition of insanity,</v>

133
00:05:52.331 --> 00:05:57.331
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doing something over and over again and </v>

134
00:05:57.331 --> 00:05:57.331
<v Speaker 2>expecting a different result.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

135
00:05:57.331 --> 00:05:58.010
<v Speaker 2>the Socialists always expect a</v>

136
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.990
<v Speaker 3>different result from doing something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that has never succeeded in</v>

137
00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:04.110
<v Speaker 4>pass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So socialism by definition is one thing,</v>

138
00:06:04.111 --> 00:06:07.710
<v Speaker 4>but by the emotional reaction that </v>
<v Speaker 4>people have is kind of another thing.</v>

139
00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.520
<v Speaker 4>The emotional reaction is there's rich </v>
<v Speaker 4>people that are a real problem.</v>

140
00:06:11.521 --> 00:06:15.540
<v Speaker 4>They're hoarding their greedy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not concerned with money.</v>

141
00:06:15.541 --> 00:06:20.541
<v Speaker 4>I want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm concerned with people and community </v>

142
00:06:20.541 --> 00:06:23.850
<v Speaker 4>and feelings and health and welfare and </v>
<v Speaker 4>education and all of that money.</v>

143
00:06:23.851 --> 00:06:28.851
<v Speaker 4>We should take it from those rich people</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we should funnel it into education </v>

144
00:06:28.851 --> 00:06:33.051
<v Speaker 4>and community.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they say all these words that make </v>

145
00:06:33.051 --> 00:06:33.051
<v Speaker 4>people feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

146
00:06:33.051 --> 00:06:33.420
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're not about money either.</v>

147
00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:37.820
<v Speaker 3>It's all about feeling good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what the liberals are about.</v>

148
00:06:37.821 --> 00:06:40.850
<v Speaker 3>It's about feeling that they're better </v>
<v Speaker 3>than everybody else because they're,</v>

149
00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:41.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

150
00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:45.410
<v Speaker 3>they're higher up on this moral pedestal</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they don't care about money,</v>

151
00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.140
<v Speaker 3>they just care about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

152
00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:50.360
<v Speaker 3>people and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you talk about rich people,</v>

153
00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:51.980
<v Speaker 3>they don't hoard money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

154
00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:57.010
<v Speaker 3>the way you get rich is not by hoarding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The way you get rich is by trying to </v>

155
00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:59.060
<v Speaker 3>figure out what problems people have </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you can solve,</v>

156
00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:04.090
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whether it's inventing something that </v>

157
00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:06.311
<v Speaker 3>makes their lives better or providing a </v>
<v Speaker 3>service that makes their lives better </v>

158
00:07:06.311 --> 00:07:08.240
<v Speaker 3>because the customers are in charge </v>
<v Speaker 3>individuals,</v>

159
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:09.680
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That that's what's gonna.</v>

160
00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.540
<v Speaker 3>Allocate wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's if,</v>

161
00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:16.560
<v Speaker 3>if somebody is better than somebody else</v>
<v Speaker 3>at satisfying the desires that people </v>

162
00:07:17.331 --> 00:07:17.960
<v Speaker 3>have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

163
00:07:17.961 --> 00:07:20.240
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I can come up with something that you</v>

164
00:07:20.241 --> 00:07:25.241
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you want to buy that's cheaper and </v>

165
00:07:25.241 --> 00:07:25.241
<v Speaker 3>better than what somebody else has come </v>
<v Speaker 3>up with,</v>

166
00:07:25.241 --> 00:07:26.390
<v Speaker 3>then you're going to buy from me.</v>

167
00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:30.560
<v Speaker 3>And so the person who ends up with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>most money is the person who's satisfied</v>

168
00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:34.280
<v Speaker 3>the most desires,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most needs in the most efficient way</v>

169
00:07:34.281 --> 00:07:37.040
<v Speaker 3>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what's benefiting society.</v>

170
00:07:37.041 --> 00:07:42.041
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's great to have charity and I'm all </v>

171
00:07:42.041 --> 00:07:42.230
<v Speaker 3>for private charity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you look at the wealthiest men in</v>

172
00:07:42.231 --> 00:07:47.231
<v Speaker 3>history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though they've been incredible </v>

173
00:07:47.231 --> 00:07:47.231
<v Speaker 3>philanthropists and they've given away a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of money,</v>

174
00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:52.300
<v Speaker 3>they helped a lot more people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a massing their fortunes than gifting </v>

175
00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:55.010
<v Speaker 3>away what they made.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was the businesses that they created,</v>

176
00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:55.850
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

177
00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:59.870
<v Speaker 3>the products that they invented,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the services that they provided,</v>

178
00:07:59.871 --> 00:08:01.070
<v Speaker 3>and the employment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

179
00:08:01.071 --> 00:08:04.010
<v Speaker 3>That was all a function of they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>creating their wealth.</v>

180
00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:09.220
<v Speaker 3>That's what did a lot more to help </v>
<v Speaker 3>society than simply giving away some of </v>

181
00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:13.721
<v Speaker 3>the money that they earned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever had a debate with a </v>

182
00:08:13.721 --> 00:08:13.721
<v Speaker 3>democratic socialist?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

183
00:08:13.721 --> 00:08:15.290
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most Democrats are socialists.</v>

184
00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:17.420
<v Speaker 3>They just don't know it or they don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to admit it,</v>

185
00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:20.870
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of people don't even </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand what socialism is because you</v>

186
00:08:20.871 --> 00:08:22.130
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll have the left.</v>

187
00:08:22.131 --> 00:08:24.650
<v Speaker 3>I'll always consider somebody like even </v>
<v Speaker 3>Donald Trump,</v>

188
00:08:24.651 --> 00:08:24.980
<v Speaker 3>they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

189
00:08:24.981 --> 00:08:26.030
<v Speaker 3>he's a fascist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

190
00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:30.320
<v Speaker 3>They don't even realize that fascism is </v>
<v Speaker 3>part of socialism.</v>

191
00:08:30.321 --> 00:08:35.321
<v Speaker 3>Socialism is a broad concept that </v>
<v Speaker 3>includes things like Communism and </v>

192
00:08:35.321 --> 00:08:37.160
<v Speaker 3>fascism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you're a communist,</v>

193
00:08:37.161 --> 00:08:39.080
<v Speaker 3>you are a socialist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But by,</v>

194
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:42.650
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't mean that if you're a </v>
<v Speaker 3>socialist or communist because you could</v>

195
00:08:42.651 --> 00:08:44.480
<v Speaker 3>be the fastest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could be for a lot of things,</v>

196
00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:49.720
<v Speaker 3>but fascism is a form of socialism where</v>
<v Speaker 3>the government doesn't just steal all </v>

197
00:08:50.421 --> 00:08:55.421
<v Speaker 3>the property,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the communists want to nationalize </v>

198
00:08:55.421 --> 00:08:57.120
<v Speaker 3>everything and take legal ownership of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the means of production.</v>

199
00:08:57.121 --> 00:08:58.950
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The government just owns all the capital</v>

200
00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:00.990
<v Speaker 3>under,</v>
<v Speaker 3>under fascism,</v>

201
00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:03.330
<v Speaker 3>but government is a little bit smarter.</v>

202
00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:08.570
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they realize that people will work </v>

203
00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:08.570
<v Speaker 3>harder if they think they're working for</v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves.</v>

204
00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:11.040
<v Speaker 3>So the fastest doesn't want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>nationalize businesses,</v>

205
00:09:11.041 --> 00:09:13.860
<v Speaker 3>they just want to control it through </v>
<v Speaker 3>regulation and taxes.</v>

206
00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:16.230
<v Speaker 3>And that's pretty much what the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Democrats want to do.</v>

207
00:09:16.231 --> 00:09:20.250
<v Speaker 3>They want to control everything by </v>
<v Speaker 3>taxing it heavily and regulating it.</v>

208
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.060
<v Speaker 3>And those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's an important aspect of fascist.</v>

209
00:09:23.061 --> 00:09:28.061
<v Speaker 3>I mean a lot of people associate fascism</v>
<v Speaker 3>with racism just because the Nazis were </v>

210
00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.090
<v Speaker 3>racist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you don't have to be racist.</v>

211
00:09:30.091 --> 00:09:35.091
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fascism started in Italy and that there </v>

212
00:09:35.091 --> 00:09:37.680
<v Speaker 3>wasn't any racism there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you go back to the Nazi party,</v>

213
00:09:37.681 --> 00:09:40.290
<v Speaker 3>it's the National Socialist Party of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Germany.</v>

214
00:09:40.291 --> 00:09:42.450
<v Speaker 3>That's what the Nazis are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's socialist.</v>

215
00:09:42.451 --> 00:09:47.451
<v Speaker 3>So fascism is a form of social and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why the communists and the </v>

216
00:09:47.451 --> 00:09:47.451
<v Speaker 3>fascists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

217
00:09:47.451 --> 00:09:50.970
<v Speaker 3>are you so much because they're really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're fighting over the same turf.</v>

218
00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:55.680
<v Speaker 3>It's which brand of socialism is better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fascism or communism,</v>

219
00:09:55.681 --> 00:09:58.440
<v Speaker 3>but they're not at opposite ends of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>political spectrum.</v>

220
00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:00.450
<v Speaker 3>They're on the same end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So do you think</v>

221
00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:05.580
<v Speaker 4>people are frustrated with the current </v>
<v Speaker 4>system and so they see someone like </v>

222
00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:06.790
<v Speaker 4>Bernie Sanders come along that offers </v>
<v Speaker 4>this radical change of pace.</v>

223
00:10:06.791 --> 00:10:07.630
<v Speaker 4>He saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

224
00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:12.640
<v Speaker 4>we need to end income inequality and </v>
<v Speaker 4>redistribute wealth and all these </v>

225
00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:17.431
<v Speaker 4>different things and it just sparks a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an emotional reaction in people that </v>

226
00:10:17.441 --> 00:10:19.900
<v Speaker 4>they know that the current system,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way it's in place,</v>

227
00:10:19.901 --> 00:10:23.080
<v Speaker 4>especially the way it was under Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they didn't like how things were that in</v>

228
00:10:23.081 --> 00:10:28.081
<v Speaker 4>like how things were under Bush.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They think we need someone who's not a </v>

229
00:10:28.081 --> 00:10:29.110
<v Speaker 4>career politician or someone who has got</v>
<v Speaker 4>a radical new approach.</v>

230
00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:32.410
<v Speaker 4>Oh look at this Bernie Sanders guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He wants to do some stuff with money.</v>

231
00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:33.730
<v Speaker 4>Let's vote for him.</v>

232
00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:34.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

233
00:10:34.431 --> 00:10:39.431
<v Speaker 3>people are grasping for straws when </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're looking for a solution that </v>

234
00:10:39.431 --> 00:10:40.590
<v Speaker 3>that's why trump is president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

235
00:10:40.591 --> 00:10:44.940
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people think that trump's </v>
<v Speaker 3>election maybe shows that the UK,</v>

236
00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:47.030
<v Speaker 3>the US electorate has moved,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

237
00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:52.150
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That were more republican or more free </v>

238
00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:54.911
<v Speaker 3>market,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's not what that election was </v>

239
00:10:54.911 --> 00:10:57.911
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was about the fact that we had a </v>

240
00:10:57.911 --> 00:10:58.730
<v Speaker 3>lousy economy and trump was honest about</v>
<v Speaker 3>that too.</v>

241
00:10:58.731 --> 00:11:03.731
<v Speaker 3>The voters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trump told people that the numbers are </v>

242
00:11:03.731 --> 00:11:06.761
<v Speaker 3>phony.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't believe these unemployment </v>

243
00:11:06.761 --> 00:11:06.761
<v Speaker 3>numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>four or five percent.</v>

244
00:11:06.761 --> 00:11:07.160
<v Speaker 3>It's a lie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fraud,</v>

245
00:11:07.161 --> 00:11:12.161
<v Speaker 3>it's fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was right because the way they </v>

246
00:11:12.161 --> 00:11:12.161
<v Speaker 3>calculated today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't calculate that.</v>

247
00:11:12.161 --> 00:11:15.170
<v Speaker 3>Millions and millions of people who I've</v>
<v Speaker 3>given up looking for work,</v>

248
00:11:15.171 --> 00:11:20.171
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't count the people who just </v>

249
00:11:20.171 --> 00:11:20.171
<v Speaker 3>have a part time job and they're still </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking for a full time job.</v>

250
00:11:20.171 --> 00:11:22.550
<v Speaker 3>So the real unemployment number is much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>much higher.</v>

251
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:24.200
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and trump talked about that and,</v>

252
00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:25.670
<v Speaker 3>and he called out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

253
00:11:25.671 --> 00:11:27.880
<v Speaker 3>all the politicians from both sides,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

254
00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:30.650
<v Speaker 3>Not just the Democrats to Republicans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>

255
00:11:30.651 --> 00:11:31.910
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to clean house.</v>

256
00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:34.040
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a politician.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vote for me,</v>

257
00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.810
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to make America great again.</v>

258
00:11:35.811 --> 00:11:37.660
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to drain the swamp,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

259
00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:39.430
<v Speaker 3>and he appealed to people's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

260
00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:40.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>

261
00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.990
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their fears about immigrants.</v>

262
00:11:41.991 --> 00:11:45.560
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to build this wall as if the </v>
<v Speaker 3>reason that things are bad is because we</v>

263
00:11:45.561 --> 00:11:47.690
<v Speaker 3>have too many immigrants taking away the</v>
<v Speaker 3>jobs.</v>

264
00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:49.190
<v Speaker 3>And so people decided,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

265
00:11:49.191 --> 00:11:50.480
<v Speaker 3>what the hell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me,</v>

266
00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:52.910
<v Speaker 3>let me give this guy a trance because </v>
<v Speaker 3>things are.</v>

267
00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:55.930
<v Speaker 3>The media is lying to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wall Street's lined to me.</v>

268
00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:57.080
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

269
00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:58.060
<v Speaker 3>trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trump won.</v>

270
00:11:58.061 --> 00:12:03.061
<v Speaker 3>But unfortunately now trump is part of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the establishment and now all of a </v>

271
00:12:03.491 --> 00:12:06.460
<v Speaker 3>sudden the fake economic numbers are </v>
<v Speaker 3>legit.</v>

272
00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:08.620
<v Speaker 3>Now every time there was an unemployment</v>
<v Speaker 3>number out,</v>

273
00:12:08.621 --> 00:12:10.810
<v Speaker 3>he tweets about how it's the lowest it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever been.</v>

274
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:15.070
<v Speaker 3>So I think that when we get this next </v>
<v Speaker 3>recession,</v>

275
00:12:15.071 --> 00:12:18.400
<v Speaker 3>which is going to happen while trump is </v>
<v Speaker 3>president during,</v>

276
00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:20.950
<v Speaker 3>during this first term,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I think will be the only term,</v>

277
00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:24.100
<v Speaker 3>but when all the why do you think those </v>
<v Speaker 3>two things?</v>

278
00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:29.280
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I think the economy is going to </v>

279
00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:30.140
<v Speaker 3>fall into a severe recession.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What makes you say the well a,</v>

280
00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:30.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

281
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:32.140
<v Speaker 3>we're overdue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

282
00:12:32.141 --> 00:12:37.141
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't normally have an expansion </v>

283
00:12:37.141 --> 00:12:37.141
<v Speaker 3>that lasts as long as this one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that we're,</v>

284
00:12:37.141 --> 00:12:40.981
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're the second longest in history and </v>

285
00:12:40.981 --> 00:12:40.981
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we go for another year,</v>

286
00:12:40.981 --> 00:12:41.440
<v Speaker 3>it will be the longest expansion in </v>
<v Speaker 3>history.</v>

287
00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:46.470
<v Speaker 4>Two thousand eight is when it started to</v>
<v Speaker 4>turn around to the end is kind of the </v>

288
00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:51.211
<v Speaker 4>end of 2009 years in exactly what is a </v>
<v Speaker 4>usual expansion and compression</v>

289
00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:52.900
<v Speaker 3>out of five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>six years.</v>

290
00:12:52.901 --> 00:12:54.520
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so this one is long,</v>

291
00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:59.610
<v Speaker 3>but it also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this one required more government </v>

292
00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:00.010
<v Speaker 3>stimulus than any other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

293
00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:03.040
<v Speaker 3>recovery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I don't think we actually recovered.</v>

294
00:13:03.041 --> 00:13:08.041
<v Speaker 3>I think the government simply injected a</v>
<v Speaker 3>bunch of cheap money into the economy </v>

295
00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:10.740
<v Speaker 3>and exacerbated the real problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

296
00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:14.320
<v Speaker 3>reflated the bubbles in the stock market</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the housing market.</v>

297
00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:16.390
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody talks about how the economy is</v>

298
00:13:16.391 --> 00:13:21.391
<v Speaker 3>doing so great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's really not much better than it </v>

299
00:13:21.391 --> 00:13:21.391
<v Speaker 3>was under Obama.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it's any better at all.</v>

300
00:13:21.391 --> 00:13:24.220
<v Speaker 3>And we GDP growth for trump's first year</v>
<v Speaker 3>in office.</v>

301
00:13:24.221 --> 00:13:26.220
<v Speaker 3>Last year was two point three percent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

302
00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:28.510
<v Speaker 3>nothing great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First quarter was two percent,</v>

303
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:31.000
<v Speaker 3>this quarter might be a better than </v>
<v Speaker 3>three,</v>

304
00:13:31.001 --> 00:13:31.870
<v Speaker 3>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe not,</v>

305
00:13:31.871 --> 00:13:36.871
<v Speaker 3>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's going to be the second </v>

306
00:13:36.871 --> 00:13:36.871
<v Speaker 3>quarter will probably be the best </v>
<v Speaker 3>quarter of the year.</v>

307
00:13:36.871 --> 00:13:37.810
<v Speaker 3>Maybe we're probably going to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>downhill,</v>

308
00:13:37.811 --> 00:13:42.811
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>last year was I think the weakest year </v>

309
00:13:42.811 --> 00:13:42.811
<v Speaker 3>of job growth since 2011.</v>

310
00:13:42.811 --> 00:13:45.160
<v Speaker 3>So people want to talk about how great </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything is,</v>

311
00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:49.210
<v Speaker 3>but it's more a function of people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>hoping things are going to turn around.</v>

312
00:13:49.211 --> 00:13:51.880
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of optimism now that </v>
<v Speaker 3>things are going to get better.</v>

313
00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:54.250
<v Speaker 3>But I think that the people who are so </v>
<v Speaker 3>optimistic,</v>

314
00:13:54.251 --> 00:13:56.270
<v Speaker 3>a lot of them are going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>disappointed because we're,</v>

315
00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:58.600
<v Speaker 3>we're going to end up with is a weaker </v>
<v Speaker 3>economy.</v>

316
00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:00.890
<v Speaker 3>The only thing that's really </v>
<v Speaker 3>strengthening is inflation.</v>

317
00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:04.330
<v Speaker 3>Inflation is going to pick up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the cost of living is really going to</v>

318
00:14:04.331 --> 00:14:07.510
<v Speaker 3>be rising as the economy is falling into</v>
<v Speaker 3>recession.</v>

319
00:14:07.511 --> 00:14:09.610
<v Speaker 3>So we get stagflation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

320
00:14:09.611 --> 00:14:13.360
<v Speaker 3>which is probably the worst possible </v>
<v Speaker 3>economic scenario.</v>

321
00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:16.420
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that the,</v>

322
00:14:16.421 --> 00:14:19.450
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the left and even the Fed is going to be</v>

323
00:14:19.451 --> 00:14:24.451
<v Speaker 3>able to blame it on trump because trump </v>
<v Speaker 3>has come in and claim credit for this </v>

324
00:14:24.451 --> 00:14:29.340
<v Speaker 3>great economy that he believes we have </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's claimed credit for the record </v>

325
00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:33.180
<v Speaker 3>in the stock market,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's basically put his name on a </v>

326
00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:33.180
<v Speaker 3>bubble and when it pops,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

327
00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:37.920
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be hard for him to try to </v>
<v Speaker 3>blame the next recession on Obama when </v>

328
00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:37.920
<v Speaker 3>he's already said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

329
00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:38.980
<v Speaker 3>this is my economy.</v>

330
00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:44.190
<v Speaker 3>I created it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so people are going to be </v>

331
00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:45.570
<v Speaker 3>disappointed and they're going to vote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think for a,</v>

332
00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:51.180
<v Speaker 3>another person whose promises change and</v>
<v Speaker 3>unfortunately that's going to come from </v>

333
00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:52.040
<v Speaker 3>the left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you think this is going to</v>

334
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.380
<v Speaker 2>happen in the next three years?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

335
00:14:54.381 --> 00:14:55.140
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

336
00:14:55.210 --> 00:15:00.210
<v Speaker 2>one is what is the bubble?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think is going to cause it </v>

337
00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:00.320
<v Speaker 2>to crash commercial real estate?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it credit?</v>

338
00:15:00.321 --> 00:15:01.220
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

339
00:15:01.221 --> 00:15:06.221
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>commercial real estate is expensive </v>

340
00:15:06.221 --> 00:15:06.221
<v Speaker 2>being it's in a bubble,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that,</v>

341
00:15:06.221 --> 00:15:06.221
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not going to cause it.</v>

342
00:15:06.221 --> 00:15:07.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean going gonna come out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bubble.</v>

343
00:15:07.521 --> 00:15:11.630
<v Speaker 2>I think we would already be in a pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>severe recession now,</v>

344
00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:14.990
<v Speaker 2>had it not been for trump winning had </v>
<v Speaker 2>hillary won.</v>

345
00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.020
<v Speaker 2>I think we'd already be there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think that makes you say that.</v>

346
00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:23.080
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got a lot of false optimism as a </v>

347
00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:23.080
<v Speaker 2>result of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of trump.</v>

348
00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:25.280
<v Speaker 2>And we did get the tax cuts and the tax </v>
<v Speaker 2>cuts,</v>

349
00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:27.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like any kind of artificial drug,</v>

350
00:15:27.831 --> 00:15:29.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can inject yourself and,</v>

351
00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:31.790
<v Speaker 2>and get a little bit of a phony high.</v>

352
00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:36.500
<v Speaker 2>Because remember the tax cuts were paid </v>
<v Speaker 2>for with debt.</v>

353
00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:38.630
<v Speaker 2>We didn't shrink government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

354
00:15:38.631 --> 00:15:40.640
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you make government smaller,</v>

355
00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:45.880
<v Speaker 2>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you can cut taxes because now </v>

356
00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:45.880
<v Speaker 2>government doesn't need as much money </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can,</v>

357
00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:50.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can relieve the taxpayer of the </v>

358
00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:50.350
<v Speaker 2>burden of paying for it and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>

359
00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:52.970
<v Speaker 2>But if you just cut taxes but you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>cut government spending.</v>

360
00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:55.320
<v Speaker 2>And of course what the trump </v>
<v Speaker 2>administration did was,</v>

361
00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:58.070
<v Speaker 2>was even worse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they increased government spending.</v>

362
00:15:58.071 --> 00:16:01.460
<v Speaker 2>We increased welfare spending,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we increased warfare spending.</v>

363
00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:03.830
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so spending is more,</v>

364
00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:08.920
<v Speaker 2>but they reduced their tax revenue so </v>
<v Speaker 2>the deficits are just exploding out of </v>

365
00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:12.020
<v Speaker 2>control and those deficits are going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do more damage to the economy.</v>

366
00:16:12.021 --> 00:16:15.680
<v Speaker 2>Then the tax cuts were benefit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>except you get the benefit first,</v>

367
00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:19.670
<v Speaker 2>maybe for the first year and then you </v>
<v Speaker 2>start to deal with the pain after that.</v>

368
00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:22.070
<v Speaker 2>And so I think that's going to set in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

369
00:16:22.071 --> 00:16:27.071
<v Speaker 2>long before the end of trump's term.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you think that this is what is </v>

370
00:16:27.071 --> 00:16:30.620
<v Speaker 2>causing the economy to be in a really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least a two to look like.</v>

371
00:16:30.621 --> 00:16:31.940
<v Speaker 2>It's in a really healthy state right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

372
00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:33.980
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the numbers,</v>

373
00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:35.870
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of the numbers look better,</v>

374
00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:38.270
<v Speaker 2>but beneath the surface,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

375
00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:39.920
<v Speaker 2>it's not improving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>

376
00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:41.960
<v Speaker 2>just like it wasn't improving under </v>
<v Speaker 2>Obama.</v>

377
00:16:41.961 --> 00:16:46.961
<v Speaker 2>That's what laid the foundation for </v>
<v Speaker 2>trump's victory was because obama and </v>

378
00:16:46.961 --> 00:16:49.310
<v Speaker 2>everybody kept talking about how great </v>
<v Speaker 2>the recovery was,</v>

379
00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:54.490
<v Speaker 2>but the average voter knew that that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>all a bunch of nonsense because he </v>

380
00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:58.121
<v Speaker 2>wasn't living in that reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you were the financial advisor to </v>

381
00:16:58.551 --> 00:17:00.680
<v Speaker 2>the president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you tell him?</v>

382
00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:06.340
<v Speaker 2>How would you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you do to try to keep the </v>

383
00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:08.870
<v Speaker 2>economy moving in the same direction?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it possible to ward off any kind of a</v>

384
00:17:08.871 --> 00:17:09.200
<v Speaker 2>crash?</v>

385
00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:14.200
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we don't want to keep it moving in </v>

386
00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:14.200
<v Speaker 2>the same direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's in the same direction it was</v>

387
00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:17.210
<v Speaker 2>going in before trump came in and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>towards the edge of a cliff.</v>

388
00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:18.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what we do,</v>

389
00:17:18.531 --> 00:17:22.520
<v Speaker 2>we need is an about face and trump is </v>
<v Speaker 2>not doing that.</v>

390
00:17:22.521 --> 00:17:27.521
<v Speaker 2>I mean about face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like for the people that are </v>

391
00:17:27.521 --> 00:17:27.620
<v Speaker 2>listening to this that don't understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they're saying,</v>

392
00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:32.650
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your comedy is supposed to be doing </v>

393
00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:34.361
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A black unemployment is the lowest it's </v>

394
00:17:34.361 --> 00:17:34.361
<v Speaker 2>ever been on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unemployment is down.</v>

395
00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:37.610
<v Speaker 2>All these jobs have been created.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

396
00:17:37.611 --> 00:17:42.611
<v Speaker 2>Well remember again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the unemployment rate is mainly down </v>

397
00:17:42.611 --> 00:17:44.330
<v Speaker 2>because so many people that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>unemployed are no longer counted as part</v>

398
00:17:44.331 --> 00:17:46.810
<v Speaker 2>of the statistics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know that that's.</v>

399
00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:50.190
<v Speaker 2>If you look at the labor force </v>
<v Speaker 2>participation rate near record,</v>

400
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:55.190
<v Speaker 3>low mean certainly for men it's the </v>
<v Speaker 3>lowest and spending in the history of </v>

401
00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:55.500
<v Speaker 3>the republic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>

402
00:17:55.590 --> 00:18:00.590
<v Speaker 3>And look at the workers to population.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So fewer and fewer people are actually </v>

403
00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:05.001
<v Speaker 3>working and more and more of the people </v>
<v Speaker 3>who aren't working are not included in </v>

404
00:18:05.001 --> 00:18:09.651
<v Speaker 3>the unemployment statistics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you backed all those people in </v>

405
00:18:09.651 --> 00:18:13.020
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>able bodied people who don't have jobs </v>

406
00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:13.290
<v Speaker 3>but should be working,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the unemployment rate is much,</v>

407
00:18:13.291 --> 00:18:16.680
<v Speaker 3>much higher so that that doesn't really </v>
<v Speaker 3>paint a good picture.</v>

408
00:18:16.681 --> 00:18:17.010
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

409
00:18:17.011 --> 00:18:20.700
<v Speaker 3>you look at the fact that so many </v>
<v Speaker 3>Americans are unqualified,</v>

410
00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:25.940
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of jobs out there that go </v>

411
00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:27.741
<v Speaker 3>unfilled because American workers aren't</v>
<v Speaker 3>qualified to fill those positions </v>

412
00:18:27.741 --> 00:18:28.380
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

413
00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:33.480
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we take a lot of our kids and we keep </v>

414
00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:34.620
<v Speaker 3>them in high school until they're 18,</v>
<v Speaker 3>19 years old.</v>

415
00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:38.190
<v Speaker 3>Many of these kids should drop out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>high school and learn a trade.</v>

416
00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:39.420
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people,</v>

417
00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:44.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't have the aptitude for </v>

418
00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:46.880
<v Speaker 3>academics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no point in just being in high </v>

419
00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:47.040
<v Speaker 3>school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of times they're glorified daycare</v>

420
00:18:47.041 --> 00:18:49.560
<v Speaker 3>centers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they should be out learning trades.</v>

421
00:18:49.561 --> 00:18:54.561
<v Speaker 3>And of course we make it harder for </v>
<v Speaker 3>employers to train people on the job </v>

422
00:18:54.561 --> 00:18:56.580
<v Speaker 3>with occupational licensing laws and </v>
<v Speaker 3>minimum wage laws.</v>

423
00:18:56.730 --> 00:19:01.730
<v Speaker 3>So we destroy a lot of the opportunities</v>
<v Speaker 3>for younger kids to get skills and then </v>

424
00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:03.840
<v Speaker 3>the ones that we send the college,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they waste their time,</v>

425
00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:05.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>majoring in liberal arts.</v>

426
00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:09.300
<v Speaker 3>So they spend four or five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>six years in college learning nothing of</v>

427
00:19:09.301 --> 00:19:13.140
<v Speaker 3>any real value in the market.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They accumulate a massive amount of debt</v>

428
00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:14.580
<v Speaker 3>in the process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

429
00:19:14.581 --> 00:19:19.581
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have a labor force that's highly </v>

430
00:19:19.581 --> 00:19:19.581
<v Speaker 3>educated and that they've got a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 3>degrees,</v>

431
00:19:19.581 --> 00:19:21.540
<v Speaker 3>maybe they didn't learn anything but </v>
<v Speaker 3>they got a piece of paper,</v>

432
00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:23.340
<v Speaker 3>but then what they have is a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>debt.</v>

433
00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:26.670
<v Speaker 3>And so we don't have a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 3>qualified to do a lot of the things that</v>

434
00:19:26.671 --> 00:19:31.671
<v Speaker 3>need to be done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what would you tell the president if </v>

435
00:19:31.671 --> 00:19:31.671
<v Speaker 3>you were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you said,</v>

436
00:19:31.671 --> 00:19:32.130
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Peter Schiff,</v>

437
00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:34.260
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know shit about the economy.</v>

438
00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:37.830
<v Speaker 3>You obviously do help me out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do I stop this bubble?</v>

439
00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:39.360
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

440
00:19:39.361 --> 00:19:41.190
<v Speaker 3>you can't stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to let it deflate.</v>

441
00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:46.280
<v Speaker 3>But the question is how does it deflate?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then what do you propose as the </v>

442
00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:46.280
<v Speaker 3>solution?</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

443
00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:49.950
<v Speaker 3>the problem that trump already made was </v>
<v Speaker 3>when he first got elected,</v>

444
00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:53.400
<v Speaker 3>he should not have changed his </v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective.</v>

445
00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:54.480
<v Speaker 3>He shouldn't have said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

446
00:19:54.481 --> 00:19:59.481
<v Speaker 3>everything is great right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's planning on running at his next </v>

447
00:19:59.481 --> 00:20:00.120
<v Speaker 3>campaign is keep America great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

448
00:20:00.121 --> 00:20:05.121
<v Speaker 3>When trump ran for office,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said America was an economic </v>

449
00:20:05.121 --> 00:20:05.370
<v Speaker 3>wasteland,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it was a disaster.</v>

450
00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:07.320
<v Speaker 3>He's been president for a little over a </v>
<v Speaker 3>year.</v>

451
00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:10.350
<v Speaker 3>All of a sudden it's the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 3>economy in the history of the country,</v>

452
00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:13.500
<v Speaker 3>which is not even close to being true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if he's gonna,</v>

453
00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:18.530
<v Speaker 3>try to run for reelection on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've already made America great and now </v>

454
00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:20.430
<v Speaker 3>we just want to keep it great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not going to resonate.</v>

455
00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:24.300
<v Speaker 3>So what he should have done from day one</v>
<v Speaker 3>is leveled with the American public.</v>

456
00:20:24.301 --> 00:20:29.301
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is how bad the problem is and this </v>

457
00:20:29.301 --> 00:20:30.390
<v Speaker 3>is what it's gonna take to solve it </v>
<v Speaker 3>because there's a lot of,</v>

458
00:20:30.391 --> 00:20:35.391
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a pain short term pain that we're </v>

459
00:20:35.391 --> 00:20:39.111
<v Speaker 3>going to need to go through in order to </v>
<v Speaker 3>come to the other side in order to get </v>

460
00:20:39.111 --> 00:20:40.650
<v Speaker 3>rid of all these problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right now,</v>

461
00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:41.820
<v Speaker 3>look at the trait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

462
00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:45.680
<v Speaker 3>Trump is making a big deal about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>trade deficits and he's launching,</v>

463
00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:49.510
<v Speaker 3>terrorist is going to have this trade </v>
<v Speaker 3>that he's convinced that we could win.</v>

464
00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:54.960
<v Speaker 3>And this is very misguided.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The trade deficits are not the problem.</v>

465
00:20:56.140 --> 00:21:01.140
<v Speaker 3>They are the consequence of the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem is that we have bad monetary</v>

466
00:21:02.951 --> 00:21:05.290
<v Speaker 3>policy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bad fiscal policy,</v>

467
00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:10.440
<v Speaker 3>too much regulation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why we have a trade deficit </v>

468
00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:11.140
<v Speaker 3>because American industry is not </v>
<v Speaker 3>productive enough.</v>

469
00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:16.380
<v Speaker 3>We don't save enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't make the right capital </v>

470
00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:19.261
<v Speaker 3>investment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's because interest rates have been </v>

471
00:21:19.261 --> 00:21:19.261
<v Speaker 3>kept too low.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

472
00:21:19.261 --> 00:21:19.500
<v Speaker 3>our tax code,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

473
00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:20.840
<v Speaker 3>favors debt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

474
00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:25.920
<v Speaker 3>and we have a lot of regulations that </v>
<v Speaker 3>make American businesses less </v>

475
00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:30.331
<v Speaker 3>competitive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the result is that we import a </v>

476
00:21:30.331 --> 00:21:30.640
<v Speaker 3>lot of products rather than making them </v>
<v Speaker 3>ourselves.</v>

477
00:21:30.641 --> 00:21:35.641
<v Speaker 3>And it's not because the other countries</v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't fair or because they have </v>

478
00:21:35.641 --> 00:21:40.110
<v Speaker 3>terrorists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Terrorists are very low around the </v>

479
00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:40.110
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

480
00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:42.400
<v Speaker 3>there's tariffs are not the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so if trump is simply going to erect</v>

481
00:21:42.401 --> 00:21:47.401
<v Speaker 3>tariffs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that's going to do is tax the </v>

482
00:21:47.401 --> 00:21:50.041
<v Speaker 3>American public because the American </v>
<v Speaker 3>public has to pay the terrorists </v>

483
00:21:50.041 --> 00:21:50.230
<v Speaker 3>whenever they buy imported products.</v>

484
00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:53.920
<v Speaker 3>So this is not going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to turn the economy around,</v>

485
00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:55.930
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trump is right.</v>

486
00:21:55.931 --> 00:21:56.980
<v Speaker 3>He points out that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

487
00:21:56.981 --> 00:22:01.981
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at one point in time America ran on </v>

488
00:22:01.981 --> 00:22:03.550
<v Speaker 3>terrace,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is true during the 19th century,</v>

489
00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:05.470
<v Speaker 3>the government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

490
00:22:05.471 --> 00:22:07.660
<v Speaker 3>raised money pro predominately by </v>
<v Speaker 3>tariffs,</v>

491
00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:09.910
<v Speaker 3>but we didn't have an income tax,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

492
00:22:09.911 --> 00:22:14.911
<v Speaker 3>And so this is the irony of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reason we have an income tax today </v>

493
00:22:14.911 --> 00:22:19.590
<v Speaker 3>is because the populist politicians of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the day told the American voter,</v>

494
00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:23.380
<v Speaker 3>if we can tax the rich with an income </v>
<v Speaker 3>tax,</v>

495
00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:27.580
<v Speaker 3>then we can get rid of terrorists that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the average person is paying.</v>

496
00:22:27.581 --> 00:22:32.581
<v Speaker 3>So the average person understood that </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrorists cost them money and the </v>

497
00:22:32.581 --> 00:22:34.690
<v Speaker 3>politicians said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's get rid of these tariffs and let's</v>

498
00:22:34.691 --> 00:22:39.691
<v Speaker 3>just tax the rich.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the income tax that was originally </v>

499
00:22:39.691 --> 00:22:40.660
<v Speaker 3>proposed really was attacks on the very </v>
<v Speaker 3>rich.</v>

500
00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:42.850
<v Speaker 3>I mean even doctors and lawyers didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>pay it.</v>

501
00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:48.030
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you had to be super rich before you pay </v>

502
00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:48.030
<v Speaker 3>the tax.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then it was like,</v>

503
00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:48.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one percent to four percent.</v>

504
00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:52.090
<v Speaker 3>So it was a small tax and it wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>taken from your paycheck,</v>

505
00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:52.750
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

506
00:22:52.751 --> 00:22:53.170
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if.</v>

507
00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:54.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you've got a paycheck,</v>

508
00:22:54.461 --> 00:22:59.461
<v Speaker 3>he didn't pay the tax,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we didn't have withholding until </v>

509
00:22:59.461 --> 00:23:02.311
<v Speaker 3>1943.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was part of the victory tax to pay </v>

510
00:23:02.311 --> 00:23:05.491
<v Speaker 3>for the Second World War.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But Americans were told let's tax the </v>

511
00:23:05.491 --> 00:23:08.470
<v Speaker 3>rich and you won't have to pay </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrorists anymore.</v>

512
00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:10.020
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was the minute that you know,</v>

513
00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:11.950
<v Speaker 3>the government got the nose under the </v>
<v Speaker 3>tent,</v>

514
00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:16.980
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of a sudden now the income tax </v>

515
00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:16.980
<v Speaker 3>effects everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

516
00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:20.161
<v Speaker 3>People pay a lot more in income taxes </v>
<v Speaker 3>today than they used to pay and </v>

517
00:23:20.161 --> 00:23:20.380
<v Speaker 3>terrorists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But now,</v>

518
00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:25.060
<v Speaker 3>now the president wants to bring the </v>
<v Speaker 3>towers back on top of the income tax.</v>

519
00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:30.270
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if trump wants to repeal the income tax </v>

520
00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:30.400
<v Speaker 3>and get rid of it entirely and then have</v>
<v Speaker 3>some terrorists,</v>

521
00:23:30.401 --> 00:23:35.401
<v Speaker 3>I'd be okay with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you can't do that unless you </v>

522
00:23:35.401 --> 00:23:35.590
<v Speaker 3>dramatically shrink the size of </v>
<v Speaker 3>government,</v>

523
00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:38.440
<v Speaker 3>which is the most important thing to </v>
<v Speaker 3>trump needs to do.</v>

524
00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:41.800
<v Speaker 3>But what he's not doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he has to make the military smaller.</v>

525
00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:42.910
<v Speaker 3>Not Bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

526
00:23:42.911 --> 00:23:47.911
<v Speaker 3>he's talking about a space force.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we can't even afford the air </v>

527
00:23:47.911 --> 00:23:49.160
<v Speaker 3>force navy marines that we got now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We will be going to make money for space</v>

528
00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:51.320
<v Speaker 3>force,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we have to cut everything.</v>

529
00:23:51.321 --> 00:23:53.080
<v Speaker 3>We got to cut entitlements,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

530
00:23:53.130 --> 00:23:55.340
<v Speaker 3>He's think we should be the first people</v>
<v Speaker 3>to have a space for us.</v>

531
00:23:55.370 --> 00:24:00.370
<v Speaker 3>What are the Russians come up with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>space for us and no one's going to come </v>

532
00:24:00.370 --> 00:24:00.370
<v Speaker 3>out of luck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are,</v>

533
00:24:00.370 --> 00:24:00.370
<v Speaker 3>what are you going?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What did he do?</v>

534
00:24:00.370 --> 00:24:02.180
<v Speaker 3>Is space for it so we can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who are going to fight in space?</v>

535
00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:05.160
<v Speaker 3>Maybe we fight the Russians is space </v>
<v Speaker 3>for.</v>

536
00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:07.220
<v Speaker 3>Why would we fight them in space?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their doubt earth?</v>

537
00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:08.900
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe they want to fight in space.</v>

538
00:24:08.901 --> 00:24:10.100
<v Speaker 3>It's more novel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

539
00:24:10.101 --> 00:24:12.050
<v Speaker 3>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think anybody wants to fight,</v>

540
00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:14.840
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Want to be protected,</v>

541
00:24:14.841 --> 00:24:15.200
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

542
00:24:15.201 --> 00:24:16.970
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we got that covered.</v>

543
00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:19.250
<v Speaker 3>I think we've got a pretty good sized </v>
<v Speaker 3>military.</v>

544
00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:21.080
<v Speaker 3>I don't think anyone's going to mess </v>
<v Speaker 3>with us.</v>

545
00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:25.070
<v Speaker 3>The problem is our economy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you say let the bubble crash,</v>

546
00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:26.990
<v Speaker 3>like what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would that entail?</v>

547
00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:28.760
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>basically the problem,</v>

548
00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:32.450
<v Speaker 3>the basic problems with the US economy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is because of monetary policy,</v>

549
00:24:32.451 --> 00:24:35.150
<v Speaker 3>fiscal policy is we don't save anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

550
00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:37.370
<v Speaker 3>And because we don't save enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't invest enough.</v>

551
00:24:37.371 --> 00:24:40.010
<v Speaker 3>We don't produce enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't make enough real things,</v>

552
00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:40.340
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

553
00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:44.450
<v Speaker 3>I mean when trump wants to say that </v>
<v Speaker 3>foreigners are taking advantage of us by</v>

554
00:24:44.451 --> 00:24:47.480
<v Speaker 3>running these huge trade surpluses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got it backwards.</v>

555
00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:51.530
<v Speaker 3>We're taking advantage of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They like the Chinese are sending us all</v>

556
00:24:51.531 --> 00:24:56.531
<v Speaker 3>these products that they worked hard to </v>
<v Speaker 3>produce and they had to use real </v>

557
00:24:56.531 --> 00:24:56.570
<v Speaker 3>resources,</v>
<v Speaker 3>land,</v>

558
00:24:56.571 --> 00:25:01.571
<v Speaker 3>labor capital to make these products and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they send them here and what do we give </v>

559
00:25:01.571 --> 00:25:01.960
<v Speaker 3>them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We give them ious,</v>

560
00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:04.940
<v Speaker 3>we give him a piece of paper and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>buy our treasury bonds.</v>

561
00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:08.600
<v Speaker 3>So in the short run,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Americans are just putting everything on</v>

562
00:25:08.601 --> 00:25:09.380
<v Speaker 3>a credit card,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

563
00:25:09.381 --> 00:25:14.381
<v Speaker 3>We're living a higher standard of living</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we can consume what we didn't </v>

564
00:25:14.381 --> 00:25:14.900
<v Speaker 3>make.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when you do that,</v>

565
00:25:14.901 --> 00:25:16.130
<v Speaker 3>you become poorer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

566
00:25:16.131 --> 00:25:18.920
<v Speaker 3>America used to be the richest creditor </v>
<v Speaker 3>nation in the world,</v>

567
00:25:18.921 --> 00:25:20.600
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The world owed us a lot of money.</v>

568
00:25:21.050 --> 00:25:23.000
<v Speaker 3>Today we're the world's biggest debtor </v>
<v Speaker 3>nation.</v>

569
00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:26.450
<v Speaker 3>How did we go from being the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 3>creditor to the biggest debtor?</v>

570
00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:31.510
<v Speaker 3>It was trade deficits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every year we keep borrowing money to </v>

571
00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:34.301
<v Speaker 3>consume and what this has done is this </v>
<v Speaker 3>has turned to rich Davidson into a poor </v>

572
00:25:34.301 --> 00:25:39.011
<v Speaker 3>nation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we just don't live like a </v>

573
00:25:39.011 --> 00:25:39.011
<v Speaker 3>coordination yet because we're still </v>
<v Speaker 3>borrowing.</v>

574
00:25:39.011 --> 00:25:43.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you can be a rich individual yet </v>

575
00:25:43.450 --> 00:25:45.761
<v Speaker 3>maintain a rich lifestyle on debt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but eventually you know that's going to </v>

576
00:25:46.671 --> 00:25:49.520
<v Speaker 3>catch up with you and then your </v>
<v Speaker 3>lifestyle is going to come crashing down</v>

577
00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:54.850
<v Speaker 3>and this is what's going to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what we should do instead of having </v>

578
00:25:54.850 --> 00:25:58.660
<v Speaker 3>a crisis imposed on us globally with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>crisis and the dollar and a crisis and </v>

579
00:25:59.211 --> 00:26:01.790
<v Speaker 3>our bond market,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we should do it ourselves.</v>

580
00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:04.820
<v Speaker 3>We should set these forces in motion </v>
<v Speaker 3>ourselves.</v>

581
00:26:04.821 --> 00:26:06.530
<v Speaker 3>So what we have to do is shrink </v>
<v Speaker 3>government,</v>

582
00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:11.650
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have to cut a lot of government </v>

583
00:26:11.650 --> 00:26:11.650
<v Speaker 3>spending,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get rid a lot of government agencies and</v>

584
00:26:11.650 --> 00:26:14.780
<v Speaker 3>departments to get government out of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>way so we can lower taxes legitimately.</v>

585
00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:20.200
<v Speaker 3>And then we have to allow the Federal </v>
<v Speaker 3>Reserve to let the market set interest </v>

586
00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:23.591
<v Speaker 3>rates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Interest rates have to be much higher </v>

587
00:26:23.591 --> 00:26:23.591
<v Speaker 3>than they are now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

588
00:26:23.591 --> 00:26:23.600
<v Speaker 3>That because that's going to encourage </v>
<v Speaker 3>people to save.</v>

589
00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:28.750
<v Speaker 3>If interest rates are high,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll put your money in the bank to </v>

590
00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:29.000
<v Speaker 3>earn that high rate of interest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When money goes into a bank,</v>

591
00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:31.250
<v Speaker 3>it can get loaned out to businesses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right now,</v>

592
00:26:31.251 --> 00:26:36.251
<v Speaker 3>all that money is going to government or</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's in the corporate bond market where </v>

593
00:26:36.261 --> 00:26:40.170
<v Speaker 3>it's not growing the economy or the </v>
<v Speaker 3>money is being used to finance stock buy</v>

594
00:26:40.171 --> 00:26:43.250
<v Speaker 3>backs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need money on main street financing,</v>

595
00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:45.330
<v Speaker 3>capital formation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

596
00:26:45.331 --> 00:26:46.770
<v Speaker 3>entrepreneurship,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

597
00:26:46.771 --> 00:26:48.060
<v Speaker 3>new businesses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>new jobs.</v>

598
00:26:48.061 --> 00:26:50.250
<v Speaker 3>So we get higher interest rates will get</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

599
00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:53.280
<v Speaker 3>And we need people to stop buying things</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can't afford.</v>

600
00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:54.840
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you buy something,</v>

601
00:26:54.841 --> 00:26:57.930
<v Speaker 3>if you have the money to pay for it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't just put it on a credit card,</v>

602
00:26:58.410 --> 00:27:03.410
<v Speaker 3>but if and if credit card interest rates</v>
<v Speaker 3>went up and if credit was contracted so </v>

603
00:27:03.410 --> 00:27:05.910
<v Speaker 3>that credit card companies were not </v>
<v Speaker 3>giving out as much credit,</v>

604
00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:11.250
<v Speaker 3>they're giving out a lot of credit now </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the government is misdirecting </v>

605
00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:11.880
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if we slow down our consumption,</v>

606
00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:15.720
<v Speaker 3>we increased our savings and investment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the economy can actually grow,</v>

607
00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:19.800
<v Speaker 3>but if interest rates go up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>asset prices have to come down.</v>

608
00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:24.830
<v Speaker 3>The stock market has to come down a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Real estate prices have to come down a </v>

609
00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:28.311
<v Speaker 3>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now that means people are going to lose </v>

610
00:27:28.311 --> 00:27:29.931
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not going to be happy about </v>

611
00:27:29.931 --> 00:27:29.931
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

612
00:27:29.931 --> 00:27:31.780
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This sounds counterintuitive to </v>

613
00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:31.780
<v Speaker 4>everything that I've always heard about </v>
<v Speaker 4>how to boost up the economy.</v>

614
00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:33.380
<v Speaker 4>The idea would be that spending and </v>
<v Speaker 4>people buying things,</v>

615
00:27:33.381 --> 00:27:35.120
<v Speaker 4>it's great for the economy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We need more of that.</v>

616
00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:35.910
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's</v>

617
00:27:36.130 --> 00:27:41.130
<v Speaker 3>put the cart before the horse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't buy something that doesn't </v>

618
00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:44.731
<v Speaker 3>exist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something has to be produced before it </v>

619
00:27:44.731 --> 00:27:47.151
<v Speaker 3>can be consumed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's the production that drives the </v>

620
00:27:47.151 --> 00:27:47.200
<v Speaker 3>economic trade,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not consumption.</v>

621
00:27:47.290 --> 00:27:52.290
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right now we're just consuming what the </v>

622
00:27:52.290 --> 00:27:52.290
<v Speaker 3>Chinese produce,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

623
00:27:52.290 --> 00:27:55.470
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the consumption doesn't mean </v>

624
00:27:55.470 --> 00:27:55.470
<v Speaker 3>anything unless you produce something </v>
<v Speaker 3>first.</v>

625
00:27:55.470 --> 00:27:57.880
<v Speaker 3>So you drive an economy by creating </v>
<v Speaker 3>supply.</v>

626
00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:02.190
<v Speaker 3>It's supply that creates demand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you just try to create demand without</v>

627
00:28:02.191 --> 00:28:03.580
<v Speaker 3>the supply,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just inflation.</v>

628
00:28:03.790 --> 00:28:08.790
<v Speaker 4>It's weird too that we keep hearing </v>
<v Speaker 4>things about Chinese telecommunications </v>

629
00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:13.411
<v Speaker 4>companies like Walway in particular.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're always telling you to not buy </v>

630
00:28:13.411 --> 00:28:13.411
<v Speaker 4>their stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That wasn't there.</v>

631
00:28:13.411 --> 00:28:17.020
<v Speaker 4>There was something about something in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the paper today about Walway.</v>

632
00:28:17.410 --> 00:28:18.400
<v Speaker 4>It was about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

633
00:28:18.401 --> 00:28:21.450
<v Speaker 4>I think another country saying no to </v>
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>

634
00:28:21.451 --> 00:28:26.451
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess Walway in particular is the </v>

635
00:28:26.451 --> 00:28:29.350
<v Speaker 4>third largest cell phone manufacturer in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the world and they have a close tie with</v>

636
00:28:29.351 --> 00:28:31.690
<v Speaker 4>the communist government and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>believe that there's,</v>

637
00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:33.910
<v Speaker 4>there might be some shenanigans going on</v>
<v Speaker 4>with them,</v>

638
00:28:34.090 --> 00:28:35.530
<v Speaker 4>their electronics.</v>

639
00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:36.850
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

640
00:28:36.851 --> 00:28:38.560
<v Speaker 3>I'm not familiar with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

641
00:28:38.561 --> 00:28:41.260
<v Speaker 3>I know that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

642
00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:41.670
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

643
00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:43.720
<v Speaker 3>there's constant talk about trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

644
00:28:43.721 --> 00:28:46.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just don't buy a certain product</v>

645
00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:52.080
<v Speaker 4>the way they were actually the State </v>
<v Speaker 4>Department told people to stop buying </v>

646
00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:53.150
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they have a national security threat</v>

647
00:28:53.151 --> 00:28:58.151
<v Speaker 4>or something or something along the </v>
<v Speaker 4>lines of I'm a third party spying the </v>

648
00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:00.130
<v Speaker 4>concerns,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what does it say here,</v>

649
00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:04.490
<v Speaker 4>Australia to band while away from five g</v>
<v Speaker 4>rollout amid security concerns,</v>

650
00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:09.260
<v Speaker 4>but us had an issue and I think the US </v>
<v Speaker 4>issue was slightly different.</v>

651
00:29:09.261 --> 00:29:14.261
<v Speaker 4>US was um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who was the State Department that was </v>

652
00:29:14.261 --> 00:29:15.340
<v Speaker 4>saying for security concerns to not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

653
00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:16.470
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>

654
00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:17.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whenever they talk,</v>

655
00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:18.380
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're talking about these,</v>

656
00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:23.480
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the auto terrorists from and they say </v>

657
00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:25.961
<v Speaker 3>it's national security as if somehow my </v>
<v Speaker 3>buying a foreign car is somehow </v>

658
00:29:25.961 --> 00:29:27.180
<v Speaker 3>jeopardizing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is the national.</v>

659
00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:32.340
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean even the Canadians have called </v>

660
00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:32.340
<v Speaker 3>trump out on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what do you mean we,</v>

661
00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:34.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we fought as allies in every single war.</v>

662
00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:38.030
<v Speaker 3>How are you saying that you have to put </v>
<v Speaker 3>tariffs on Canadian?</v>

663
00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:40.120
<v Speaker 4>So why is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why is trump doing this?</v>

664
00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:42.250
<v Speaker 4>Look again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's going after</v>

665
00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:45.850
<v Speaker 3>the symptom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trade deficits are the consequences of a</v>

666
00:29:45.851 --> 00:29:50.851
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most politicians ignored the trade </v>

667
00:29:50.851 --> 00:29:50.851
<v Speaker 3>deficits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

668
00:29:50.851 --> 00:29:52.720
<v Speaker 3>At least Donald trump is putting them on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the spotlight and saying,</v>

669
00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:54.010
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a problem.</v>

670
00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:59.100
<v Speaker 3>It is a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not for the reason that trump </v>

671
00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:01.231
<v Speaker 3>believes in the short run in the here </v>
<v Speaker 3>and now the trade deficits benefit </v>

672
00:30:01.231 --> 00:30:06.211
<v Speaker 3>America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because the world is subsidizing our </v>

673
00:30:06.211 --> 00:30:09.091
<v Speaker 3>standard of living.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're getting to buy things that we </v>

674
00:30:09.091 --> 00:30:09.091
<v Speaker 3>otherwise wouldn't be able to have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

675
00:30:09.091 --> 00:30:13.261
<v Speaker 3>without these trade deficits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we wouldn't have all these consumer </v>

676
00:30:13.261 --> 00:30:13.261
<v Speaker 3>goods on all these shelves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

677
00:30:13.261 --> 00:30:16.330
<v Speaker 3>people would not be able to buys them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Prices would be much higher if we had to</v>

678
00:30:16.331 --> 00:30:19.240
<v Speaker 3>make stuff ourselves by having the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Chinese make it,</v>

679
00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:21.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a lot cheaper and plus,</v>

680
00:30:21.281 --> 00:30:22.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's great for the,</v>

681
00:30:22.091 --> 00:30:27.091
<v Speaker 3>our environment because we don't have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>pollute our own air because the </v>

682
00:30:27.091 --> 00:30:27.091
<v Speaker 3>factories are over there.</v>

683
00:30:27.091 --> 00:30:31.500
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's so he's right that it's a </v>

684
00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:34.501
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in that it's a reflection of the </v>

685
00:30:34.501 --> 00:30:38.281
<v Speaker 3>fact that the economy is inefficient and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what needs to be addressed.</v>

686
00:30:38.441 --> 00:30:38.950
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

687
00:30:38.951 --> 00:30:43.951
<v Speaker 3>we have cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you just can't put bandaids on the </v>

688
00:30:43.951 --> 00:30:45.820
<v Speaker 3>blemishes or something to cover it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to actually get to the source of</v>

689
00:30:45.821 --> 00:30:50.821
<v Speaker 3>those blemishes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the the Federal Reserve and </v>

690
00:30:50.821 --> 00:30:54.121
<v Speaker 3>their bad monetary policy and our </v>
<v Speaker 3>government policy or our fiscal policy </v>

691
00:30:54.121 --> 00:30:58.591
<v Speaker 3>or regulatory policy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need to have that type of change and </v>

692
00:30:58.591 --> 00:31:02.281
<v Speaker 3>then the trade deficits will go away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if we simply tried to put tariffs </v>

693
00:31:02.281 --> 00:31:03.670
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just going to make our own problems</v>

694
00:31:03.671 --> 00:31:08.671
<v Speaker 3>worse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All that's going to do is make prices </v>

695
00:31:08.671 --> 00:31:08.671
<v Speaker 3>higher.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is this going to mean that Americans are</v>

696
00:31:08.671 --> 00:31:12.301
<v Speaker 3>gonna have to spend more money buying </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff and it also actually undermines a </v>

697
00:31:12.301 --> 00:31:16.561
<v Speaker 3>lot of American businesses that export </v>
<v Speaker 3>into countries that are retaliating and </v>

698
00:31:16.561 --> 00:31:20.641
<v Speaker 3>also a lot of us businesses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a import components and then they </v>

699
00:31:20.641 --> 00:31:24.991
<v Speaker 3>assemble the components here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now those important parts are going </v>

700
00:31:24.991 --> 00:31:28.221
<v Speaker 3>to be more expensive and so their net </v>
<v Speaker 3>exports are more expensive and so they </v>

701
00:31:28.221 --> 00:31:28.221
<v Speaker 3>become less efficient.</v>

702
00:31:28.221 --> 00:31:32.960
<v Speaker 4>The people that are supporting trump,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that people that are happy with the way </v>

703
00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:35.691
<v Speaker 4>things are going have have said that him</v>
<v Speaker 4>lowering taxes for corporations </v>

704
00:31:35.881 --> 00:31:40.881
<v Speaker 4>encourages growth and encourages it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It gets more jobs and there's more </v>

705
00:31:41.581 --> 00:31:43.800
<v Speaker 4>economic activity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does that make sense?</v>

706
00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:44.370
<v Speaker 4>Well look,</v>

707
00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:46.480
<v Speaker 3>if we eliminate taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

708
00:31:46.481 --> 00:31:51.481
<v Speaker 3>that'd be great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the lower taxes are the better </v>

709
00:31:51.481 --> 00:31:54.001
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not if you borrow the money to pay </v>

710
00:31:54.001 --> 00:31:56.701
<v Speaker 3>for the tax cuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the idea is if the government now has</v>

711
00:31:56.861 --> 00:32:01.120
<v Speaker 3>to go into the market and borrow money </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it no longer collects and taxes,</v>

712
00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:03.490
<v Speaker 3>that's going to have an impact on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>economy,</v>

713
00:32:03.491 --> 00:32:06.460
<v Speaker 3>that's going to further deplete our </v>
<v Speaker 3>savings pool.</v>

714
00:32:06.461 --> 00:32:11.461
<v Speaker 3>That's going to put real upward pressure</v>
<v Speaker 3>on interest rates and obviously the Fed </v>

715
00:32:11.461 --> 00:32:15.571
<v Speaker 3>is trying to counteract that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know what they did with the tax </v>

716
00:32:15.571 --> 00:32:17.500
<v Speaker 3>code though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they dramatically complicated it.</v>

717
00:32:17.501 --> 00:32:22.501
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot more complexity in the </v>

718
00:32:22.501 --> 00:32:23.050
<v Speaker 3>code now than there was before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not like it wasn't complex before.</v>

719
00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:25.750
<v Speaker 3>So initially they talked about </v>
<v Speaker 3>simplifying the code.</v>

720
00:32:25.751 --> 00:32:27.260
<v Speaker 3>They didn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

721
00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:28.330
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they made the,</v>

722
00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:33.380
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the code a lot more complex and they </v>

723
00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:33.380
<v Speaker 3>certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

724
00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:35.620
<v Speaker 3>they lowered,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they raised lower taxes for some people,</v>

725
00:32:35.621 --> 00:32:37.680
<v Speaker 3>but they raise taxes for other people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Me,</v>

726
00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:39.920
<v Speaker 3>depending on what state you're in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are a of people now that are going</v>

727
00:32:39.921 --> 00:32:39.980
<v Speaker 3>to</v>

728
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:41.290
<v Speaker 2>pay higher taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

729
00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:42.560
<v Speaker 2>See what people are doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

730
00:32:42.561 --> 00:32:44.410
<v Speaker 2>people in California are you gotTa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

731
00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:49.720
<v Speaker 2>you got a 13 percent income tax in </v>
<v Speaker 2>California that's no longer deductible </v>

732
00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:50.390
<v Speaker 2>on your state income tax,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on your federal income tax.</v>

733
00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:52.160
<v Speaker 2>So that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a new thing.</v>

734
00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:52.670
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

735
00:32:52.671 --> 00:32:55.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>up until this year you could deduct your</v>

736
00:32:55.431 --> 00:32:57.440
<v Speaker 2>state income tax from your federal </v>
<v Speaker 2>income tax.</v>

737
00:32:57.441 --> 00:33:01.160
<v Speaker 2>So you did the effective tax rate was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

738
00:33:01.210 --> 00:33:06.210
<v Speaker 2>maybe 40 percent less because it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>just money you would've sent to </v>

739
00:33:06.210 --> 00:33:06.650
<v Speaker 2>Washington.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So instead you send it to Sacramento.</v>

740
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:11.950
<v Speaker 2>But basically the state tax rates are </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost double now what they were last </v>

741
00:33:11.950 --> 00:33:12.150
<v Speaker 2>year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

742
00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:14.600
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way it impacts the payer.</v>

743
00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:18.230
<v Speaker 2>So there's a big increase in state taxes</v>
<v Speaker 2>for individuals.</v>

744
00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:19.610
<v Speaker 2>You didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't know that?</v>

745
00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:20.890
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

746
00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:25.900
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotta you know you're going to move </v>

747
00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:25.900
<v Speaker 2>to Puerto Rico with me.</v>

748
00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:28.120
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I hear you guys don't have any </v>

749
00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:28.120
<v Speaker 2>power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

750
00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:28.120
<v Speaker 2>we got power now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now many months.</v>

751
00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:28.870
<v Speaker 2>Did it take?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

752
00:33:28.871 --> 00:33:30.740
<v Speaker 2>Don't I have generator?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

753
00:33:30.741 --> 00:33:35.741
<v Speaker 2>but you're the only one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like guards outside making sure </v>

754
00:33:35.741 --> 00:33:37.250
<v Speaker 2>nobody steals your water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

755
00:33:37.251 --> 00:33:37.840
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

756
00:33:37.841 --> 00:33:40.640
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact we were laughing about it,</v>

757
00:33:40.641 --> 00:33:43.250
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was on your show a year ago,</v>

758
00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:43.990
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We talked,</v>

759
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.390
<v Speaker 2>we talked a lot about Puerto Rico.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was post trump.</v>

760
00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:48.500
<v Speaker 2>Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trump was.</v>

761
00:33:48.501 --> 00:33:52.280
<v Speaker 2>Trump had won but it was before Maria,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

762
00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:57.340
<v Speaker 2>And so I was on the show and we were </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about Puerto Rico and we also </v>

763
00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:59.810
<v Speaker 2>talked about cryptocurrencies and </v>
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin and stuff like that.</v>

764
00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:05.350
<v Speaker 2>But since then hundreds and hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>crypto guys have moved to Puerto Rico.</v>

765
00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.510
<v Speaker 2>I met some of my neighbors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now are these crypto millionaires?</v>

766
00:34:11.511 --> 00:34:13.410
<v Speaker 2>They're living on the beach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

767
00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:14.960
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they weren't there a year ago.</v>

768
00:34:15.220 --> 00:34:16.410
<v Speaker 2>They're there now.</v>

769
00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:16.920
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

770
00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:18.860
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they call it a poor topia.</v>

771
00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:22.040
<v Speaker 2>They all want to come there because </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no capital gains tax.</v>

772
00:34:22.041 --> 00:34:23.270
<v Speaker 2>But I got to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

773
00:34:23.271 --> 00:34:26.390
<v Speaker 2>kind of credit you because I think a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of these guys didn't know about it until</v>

774
00:34:26.391 --> 00:34:28.790
<v Speaker 2>they heard about it on this podcast and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they said,</v>

775
00:34:28.791 --> 00:34:33.791
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no taxes down there in Puerto </v>

776
00:34:33.791 --> 00:34:36.160
<v Speaker 2>Rico and now they're all there and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>moved there just in time for the </v>

777
00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:36.160
<v Speaker 2>hurricane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

778
00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:40.541
<v Speaker 2>they moved after the hurricane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I moved before the hurricane is moving </v>

779
00:34:40.541 --> 00:34:41.240
<v Speaker 2>after the hurricane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a better move.</v>

780
00:34:41.241 --> 00:34:46.241
<v Speaker 2>Financially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's probably cheaper land easier now </v>

781
00:34:46.241 --> 00:34:51.100
<v Speaker 2>know I can't even tell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of the real estate has actually </v>

782
00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:51.100
<v Speaker 2>gone up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

783
00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:56.080
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like the real estate that was </v>

784
00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:56.080
<v Speaker 2>untouched,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

785
00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:56.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean my community a weathered the </v>
<v Speaker 2>storm pretty well,</v>

786
00:34:56.541 --> 00:35:00.180
<v Speaker 2>so maybe it made it more desirable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really Widens your community.</v>

787
00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:01.400
<v Speaker 2>You do so well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just,</v>

788
00:35:01.401 --> 00:35:02.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

789
00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:02.960
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

790
00:35:02.961 --> 00:35:04.720
<v Speaker 2>even though I'm on the beach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the elevation is,</v>

791
00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:08.900
<v Speaker 2>is very high so we didn't get any </v>
<v Speaker 2>flooding and I guess the construction is</v>

792
00:35:08.901 --> 00:35:10.040
<v Speaker 2>much better there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

793
00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:13.360
<v Speaker 2>the houses are built better so they </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't know.</v>

794
00:35:13.390 --> 00:35:18.390
<v Speaker 2>They didn't withstand the damage and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>community got up and up and running a </v>

795
00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:18.740
<v Speaker 2>lot quicker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how long were you without power?</v>

796
00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:19.760
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was.</v>

797
00:35:19.761 --> 00:35:24.761
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>officially there was probably no power </v>

798
00:35:24.761 --> 00:35:24.761
<v Speaker 2>for a couple months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I have a,</v>

799
00:35:24.761 --> 00:35:28.591
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my condo has power just as a big </v>

800
00:35:28.591 --> 00:35:28.591
<v Speaker 2>generator and so we had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had condo power there right away,</v>

801
00:35:28.591 --> 00:35:31.070
<v Speaker 2>but the house that I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ended up buying a house there too,</v>

802
00:35:31.071 --> 00:35:36.071
<v Speaker 2>right before the hurricane and I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>have the generator put in yet so the </v>

803
00:35:36.071 --> 00:35:36.590
<v Speaker 2>house didn't have power for months and </v>
<v Speaker 2>months,</v>

804
00:35:36.591 --> 00:35:38.010
<v Speaker 2>which just exasperate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I</v>

805
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:43.010
<v Speaker 3>had some damage to the house and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fact that there is no power made it </v>

806
00:35:43.010 --> 00:35:43.380
<v Speaker 3>worse because it got very humid in </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

807
00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:48.500
<v Speaker 3>But I've since purchased a generator and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got it all installed and so I'm </v>

808
00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:49.590
<v Speaker 3>ready for the next,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the next hurricane.</v>

809
00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:51.470
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

810
00:35:51.590 --> 00:35:54.240
<v Speaker 3>I got those funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>funny they'd before the hurricane.</v>

811
00:35:54.810 --> 00:35:59.730
<v Speaker 3>There was a lot of controversy from this</v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast from my,</v>

812
00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:00.420
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

813
00:36:00.450 --> 00:36:00.990
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

814
00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:03.240
<v Speaker 3>my talk about Puerto Rico because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>mentioned on,</v>

815
00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:07.230
<v Speaker 3>on the show that I had moved some </v>
<v Speaker 3>employees to Puerto Rico.</v>

816
00:36:07.231 --> 00:36:11.040
<v Speaker 3>I have three single guys that used to </v>
<v Speaker 3>live out in southern California and they</v>

817
00:36:11.041 --> 00:36:14.880
<v Speaker 3>all moved out to Puerto Rico because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>moved my business there.</v>

818
00:36:14.881 --> 00:36:17.820
<v Speaker 3>This was in 2013.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I moved my asset management company.</v>

819
00:36:17.821 --> 00:36:19.820
<v Speaker 3>You're Pacific asset management,</v>
<v Speaker 3>moved it to,</v>

820
00:36:19.830 --> 00:36:21.030
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to Puerto Rico.</v>

821
00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:26.540
<v Speaker 3>And so these guys moved out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're single guys that I mentioned </v>

822
00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:26.540
<v Speaker 3>that they were having a good time there.</v>

823
00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:27.900
<v Speaker 3>A lot of very beautiful women in Puerto </v>
<v Speaker 3>Rico,</v>

824
00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:29.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

825
00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:32.610
<v Speaker 3>I mentioned I think five Ms Dot Universe</v>
<v Speaker 3>has been from Puerto Rico,</v>

826
00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:35.160
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a lot for a small place.</v>

827
00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:40.820
<v Speaker 3>And I said that know they have a good </v>
<v Speaker 3>time there because the labor force </v>

828
00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:41.640
<v Speaker 3>participation rate in Puerto Rico is </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible.</v>

829
00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:43.440
<v Speaker 3>I mean hardly anybody has a job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe,</v>

830
00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:46.950
<v Speaker 3>maybe a third of the people who should </v>
<v Speaker 3>be working or working.</v>

831
00:36:46.951 --> 00:36:47.550
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

832
00:36:47.551 --> 00:36:52.551
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again because of the socialism down </v>

833
00:36:52.551 --> 00:36:52.551
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the welfare state that's there and it,</v>

834
00:36:52.551 --> 00:36:57.040
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the minimum wage in Puerto Rico is </v>

835
00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:57.040
<v Speaker 3>effectively like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

836
00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:57.450
<v Speaker 3>it's the medium wage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like having a $15,</v>

837
00:36:57.451 --> 00:37:02.451
<v Speaker 3>$17 an hour minimum wage year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it destroys a lot of employment </v>

838
00:37:02.451 --> 00:37:02.451
<v Speaker 3>opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dying island.</v>

839
00:37:02.451 --> 00:37:03.570
<v Speaker 3>So I mentioned that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

840
00:37:03.571 --> 00:37:04.680
<v Speaker 3>if they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

841
00:37:04.681 --> 00:37:09.681
<v Speaker 3>they have a good time down there because</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of women and if you're a </v>

842
00:37:09.681 --> 00:37:09.681
<v Speaker 3>guy and you got a job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

843
00:37:09.681 --> 00:37:10.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could write your own ticket,</v>

844
00:37:10.411 --> 00:37:14.940
<v Speaker 3>that's a big plus to have a job because </v>
<v Speaker 3>women want to date guys with jobs.</v>

845
00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:17.040
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this was controversial,</v>

846
00:37:17.070 --> 00:37:18.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't think it would be,</v>

847
00:37:18.301 --> 00:37:22.620
<v Speaker 3>but all of a sudden all these big guys </v>
<v Speaker 3>down there in Puerto Rico,</v>

848
00:37:22.621 --> 00:37:27.621
<v Speaker 3>they'll probably say something again </v>
<v Speaker 3>because obviously they watch your </v>

849
00:37:27.621 --> 00:37:27.621
<v Speaker 3>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

850
00:37:27.621 --> 00:37:31.540
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>couple of really big guys were calling </v>

851
00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:33.120
<v Speaker 3>me out saying that I'm insulting Puerto </v>
<v Speaker 3>Rican women.</v>

852
00:37:33.121 --> 00:37:33.600
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

853
00:37:33.601 --> 00:37:38.601
<v Speaker 3>I'm calling them whores or something </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I said that they want to date </v>

854
00:37:38.601 --> 00:37:38.601
<v Speaker 3>guys with jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

855
00:37:38.601 --> 00:37:38.601
<v Speaker 3>why</v>

856
00:37:38.601 --> 00:37:41.200
<v Speaker 2>doesn't every woman want a data guy with</v>
<v Speaker 2>a job?</v>

857
00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:46.260
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just Puerto Rican into running </v>

858
00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:46.260
<v Speaker 2>around going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to go with a job.</v>

859
00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:46.260
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

860
00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:49.270
<v Speaker 2>Of course a girl wants a god that has a </v>
<v Speaker 2>job.</v>

861
00:37:49.271 --> 00:37:50.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every girl.</v>

862
00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:55.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean probably one of the main reasons </v>

863
00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:55.680
<v Speaker 2>we get jobs is to get girls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

864
00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:56.020
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

865
00:37:56.021 --> 00:38:01.021
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>generally the more attractive the woman </v>

866
00:38:01.021 --> 00:38:04.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more the better your job's going to </v>

867
00:38:04.170 --> 00:38:04.170
<v Speaker 2>have to be to attract her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

868
00:38:04.170 --> 00:38:07.441
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a term for that high pergamum </v>

869
00:38:07.441 --> 00:38:10.970
<v Speaker 2>like women tend to gravitate towards men</v>
<v Speaker 2>with higher social status status and </v>

870
00:38:10.970 --> 00:38:11.560
<v Speaker 2>higher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well first of all,</v>

871
00:38:11.561 --> 00:38:13.240
<v Speaker 2>if you want a guy to take you out on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>date,</v>

872
00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:15.070
<v Speaker 2>if he doesn't have a job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where's he going to take you?</v>

873
00:38:15.130 --> 00:38:16.050
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

874
00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:17.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I mean it's not.</v>

875
00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:22.440
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think it was a controversial </v>
<v Speaker 2>statement is I think that point just </v>

876
00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:25.891
<v Speaker 2>making much ado about nothing these days</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they can write a blog and then you </v>

877
00:38:25.891 --> 00:38:29.101
<v Speaker 2>talk about what they wrote because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>were upset that them being upset at you </v>

878
00:38:29.101 --> 00:38:29.620
<v Speaker 2>on the podcast and talking about it </v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

879
00:38:29.621 --> 00:38:30.730
<v Speaker 2>So you're feeding it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

880
00:38:30.731 --> 00:38:31.920
<v Speaker 2>but I'm correcting it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

881
00:38:31.921 --> 00:38:33.790
<v Speaker 2>I just want to say that it's not just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

882
00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:37.720
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing wrong with a woman </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanting a guide that,</v>

883
00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:40.450
<v Speaker 2>that has a good job and not only that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's favorable.</v>

884
00:38:40.590 --> 00:38:41.000
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

885
00:38:41.001 --> 00:38:46.001
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not only just because he can </v>

886
00:38:46.001 --> 00:38:46.001
<v Speaker 2>take her on a date.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

887
00:38:46.001 --> 00:38:48.960
<v Speaker 2>when a woman is on a date with a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean everybody is a potential husband </v>

888
00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:49.210
<v Speaker 2>and you've got to bring something to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>table.</v>

889
00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:50.250
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotta you know,</v>

892
00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:53.670
<v Speaker 2>You gotTa,</v>

<v Speaker 2>basement.</v>

<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to get a job right to get the </v>

895
00:39:02.690 --> 00:39:02.690
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then when you get some money,</v>

896
00:39:02.690 --> 00:39:03.610
<v Speaker 2>you get the power to get the whipping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How are they saying?</v>

897
00:39:03.611 --> 00:39:08.611
<v Speaker 2>What was the protest that I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>insulting Puerto Rican women by saying </v>

898
00:39:08.611 --> 00:39:12.121
<v Speaker 2>they want a man with a job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they're just all gold diggers or </v>

899
00:39:12.121 --> 00:39:12.121
<v Speaker 2>something and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

900
00:39:12.121 --> 00:39:12.940
<v Speaker 2>I didn't say that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

901
00:39:12.941 --> 00:39:13.830
<v Speaker 2>it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they only,</v>

902
00:39:13.930 --> 00:39:15.550
<v Speaker 2>they only wanted money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But look,</v>

903
00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:18.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having a job is a key thing.</v>

904
00:39:18.251 --> 00:39:18.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

905
00:39:18.970 --> 00:39:23.970
<v Speaker 2>we don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guys don't care as much what the </v>

906
00:39:23.970 --> 00:39:23.970
<v Speaker 2>woman does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But women,</v>

907
00:39:23.970 --> 00:39:24.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's a big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most nothing.</v>

908
00:39:24.281 --> 00:39:25.690
<v Speaker 2>They don't care at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If she's hot,</v>

909
00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:28.360
<v Speaker 2>if it takes a lot of money and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>girl's hot.</v>

910
00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:29.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

911
00:39:29.091 --> 00:39:31.230
<v Speaker 2>look here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she got nice to read.</v>

912
00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:35.200
<v Speaker 2>If a guy was going to set up a guy right</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a friend,</v>

913
00:39:35.201 --> 00:39:37.720
<v Speaker 2>the first thing that guy's going to say </v>
<v Speaker 2>ask is what does she look like?</v>

914
00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:38.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

915
00:39:38.171 --> 00:39:39.880
<v Speaker 2>That's the first question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is She nice?</v>

916
00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:44.230
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If a woman is going to tell a girlfriend</v>

917
00:39:44.231 --> 00:39:46.060
<v Speaker 2>about a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the first question?</v>

918
00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:49.080
<v Speaker 2>Probably what it looks like first know </v>
<v Speaker 2>what is he doing?</v>

919
00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:51.640
<v Speaker 2>I guarantee it's what is he doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does he do for a living?</v>

920
00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:55.140
<v Speaker 2>I think first it's what he looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Second is what is he not know?</v>

<v Speaker 2>down on.</v>

922
00:39:57.250 --> 00:39:58.990
<v Speaker 2>I think it's what does he do for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>living?</v>

923
00:39:58.991 --> 00:40:00.740
<v Speaker 2>Is He.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does he have a nice personalities?</v>

924
00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:03.040
<v Speaker 2>They have a good sense of humor I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

925
00:40:03.130 --> 00:40:08.130
<v Speaker 2>How does he look?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is a little bit lower down on a woman's </v>

926
00:40:08.130 --> 00:40:08.130
<v Speaker 2>totem pole.</v>

927
00:40:08.130 --> 00:40:08.410
<v Speaker 2>Have to pass it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How hot she is.</v>

928
00:40:09.730 --> 00:40:11.280
<v Speaker 2>Well maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

929
00:40:11.290 --> 00:40:13.380
<v Speaker 2>It depends on how good she's doing in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the marketplace.</v>

930
00:40:13.410 --> 00:40:14.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean,</v>

931
00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:17.650
<v Speaker 2>but all this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's almost,</v>

932
00:40:17.651 --> 00:40:22.651
<v Speaker 2>it was almost part of the whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>political correctness thing of it like </v>

933
00:40:22.651 --> 00:40:22.651
<v Speaker 2>or the me too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you can't,</v>

934
00:40:22.651 --> 00:40:22.720
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

935
00:40:22.721 --> 00:40:24.130
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't say something.</v>

936
00:40:24.131 --> 00:40:27.040
<v Speaker 2>Anything that you say is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>spun like this is,</v>

937
00:40:27.041 --> 00:40:31.810
<v Speaker 2>this is against women because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>stating something that's very obvious,</v>

938
00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:32.650
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>

939
00:40:32.651 --> 00:40:34.990
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that so can't state obvious anymore.</v>

940
00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:36.500
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

941
00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:37.510
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it.</v>

942
00:40:37.610 --> 00:40:42.610
<v Speaker 2>It's all like look like you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I think these outrage peddlers </v>

943
00:40:42.610 --> 00:40:43.960
<v Speaker 2>that make these articles and write these</v>
<v Speaker 2>blogs,</v>

944
00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:46.270
<v Speaker 2>who the fuck is agreeing with them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

945
00:40:46.271 --> 00:40:51.271
<v Speaker 2>I just don't buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what they're doing is they're </v>

946
00:40:51.271 --> 00:40:52.900
<v Speaker 2>striking a chord and a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a few malcontents go along with it.</v>

947
00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:55.490
<v Speaker 2>But you read those things and you think </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

948
00:40:55.510 --> 00:41:00.510
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some validity to this because </v>

949
00:41:00.510 --> 00:41:01.510
<v Speaker 2>it's in x publication.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I got a comment on this.</v>

950
00:41:01.511 --> 00:41:03.340
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're misrepresenting what I said,</v>

951
00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:05.490
<v Speaker 2>but they're outraged merchants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

952
00:41:05.491 --> 00:41:10.491
<v Speaker 2>And everybody wants to act like you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't say something that's offensive to </v>

953
00:41:10.491 --> 00:41:15.121
<v Speaker 2>anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if somebody gets offended then you </v>

954
00:41:15.121 --> 00:41:15.121
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

955
00:41:15.121 --> 00:41:15.121
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

956
00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:15.820
<v Speaker 2>what was this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

957
00:41:15.821 --> 00:41:18.280
<v Speaker 2>this one of these contestants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read this story,</v>

958
00:41:18.281 --> 00:41:20.890
<v Speaker 2>but one of the contestants on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bachelorette,</v>

959
00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:26.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm apparently on his instagram page.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He liked some jokes that,</v>

960
00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:28.690
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

961
00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:33.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe off color a little bit offensive </v>

962
00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:33.720
<v Speaker 2>jokes that right wing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody on the.</v>

963
00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:38.560
<v Speaker 2>I had posted on their instagram page and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like a big deal to take that as </v>

964
00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:39.980
<v Speaker 2>whole instagram page.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

965
00:41:40.070 --> 00:41:42.560
<v Speaker 2>it's obviously jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're jokes.</v>

966
00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:45.320
<v Speaker 2>Jokes are offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's part of what makes them funny.</v>

967
00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:50.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean how it almost all the jokes </v>

968
00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:52.541
<v Speaker 2>offend somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now you can't even have a sense of </v>

969
00:41:52.541 --> 00:41:52.670
<v Speaker 2>humor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything has to be,</v>

970
00:41:52.671 --> 00:41:53.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't,</v>

971
00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:59.000
<v Speaker 2>you can't offend anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you don't have a right not to be </v>

972
00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.411
<v Speaker 2>offended.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the whole part of freedom of </v>

973
00:42:02.411 --> 00:42:04.121
<v Speaker 2>speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are going to say things and do </v>

974
00:42:04.121 --> 00:42:06.551
<v Speaker 2>things that you might be offended by and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just gotta you just gotTa deal with </v>

975
00:42:06.551 --> 00:42:07.100
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't be looking like,</v>

976
00:42:07.101 --> 00:42:07.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

977
00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:09.890
<v Speaker 2>I got to have a law against that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or,</v>

978
00:42:09.891 --> 00:42:10.850
<v Speaker 2>but these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

979
00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:14.180
<v Speaker 2>these offense merchants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people that get offended,</v>

980
00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:15.110
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

981
00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:16.610
<v Speaker 2>that's their currency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

982
00:42:16.611 --> 00:42:21.611
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they trade in being offended and then </v>

983
00:42:21.611 --> 00:42:23.540
<v Speaker 2>once they find something that's in any </v>
<v Speaker 2>way offensive,</v>

984
00:42:23.570 --> 00:42:26.390
<v Speaker 2>they just start writing blogs about it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and making videos about it.</v>

985
00:42:26.391 --> 00:42:28.010
<v Speaker 2>And that's their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's their,</v>

986
00:42:28.011 --> 00:42:33.011
<v Speaker 2>in their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in is finding something Peter Shifts </v>

987
00:42:33.011 --> 00:42:35.921
<v Speaker 2>said about Puerto Rican women women's </v>
<v Speaker 2>offensive because it's just,</v>

988
00:42:37.391 --> 00:42:38.540
<v Speaker 2>this is the world we live in.</v>

989
00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:43.540
<v Speaker 2>A white guy like you wealthy guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to talk about Puerto Rican </v>

990
00:42:43.540 --> 00:42:44.150
<v Speaker 2>women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you fucking piece of shit.</v>

991
00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:44.830
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

992
00:42:44.890 --> 00:42:46.460
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're white,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of,</v>

993
00:42:46.461 --> 00:42:49.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean there are a little darker skin </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the most complicated,</v>

994
00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:52.670
<v Speaker 2>but in this day and age that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>Latino,</v>

995
00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:54.650
<v Speaker 2>they're people of color.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What color am I?</v>

996
00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:55.830
<v Speaker 2>I got to La.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

997
00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:56.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a little color.</v>

998
00:42:56.691 --> 00:43:01.691
<v Speaker 2>To me that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an interesting conversation I </v>

999
00:43:01.691 --> 00:43:01.691
<v Speaker 2>just had with a friend of mine who she </v>
<v Speaker 2>claimed she's black.</v>

1000
00:43:01.691 --> 00:43:02.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm darker than you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1001
00:43:02.511 --> 00:43:03.810
<v Speaker 2>you black.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1002
00:43:03.950 --> 00:43:08.950
<v Speaker 2>But it's all like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's this whole mentality that people </v>

1003
00:43:08.950 --> 00:43:11.921
<v Speaker 2>have now about not being offended is </v>
<v Speaker 2>about feeling that they have a right to </v>

1004
00:43:11.921 --> 00:43:16.280
<v Speaker 2>something or not being entitled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tyler people confusing a privilege with,</v>

1005
00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:16.850
<v Speaker 2>with the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1006
00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:17.630
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1007
00:43:17.631 --> 00:43:19.520
<v Speaker 2>So you have all these groups that </v>
<v Speaker 2>demand,</v>

1008
00:43:19.521 --> 00:43:21.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>women's rights or gay rights,</v>

1009
00:43:22.370 --> 00:43:27.370
<v Speaker 2>women or gays,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't have rights because they're </v>

1010
00:43:27.370 --> 00:43:27.370
<v Speaker 2>women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1011
00:43:27.410 --> 00:43:32.410
<v Speaker 2>We all have individual rights and so men</v>
<v Speaker 2>and women have rights because they're </v>

1012
00:43:32.410 --> 00:43:34.160
<v Speaker 2>individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't get a separate.</v>

1013
00:43:34.161 --> 00:43:36.240
<v Speaker 2>Right because they fit into a group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1014
00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:41.270
<v Speaker 2>All that is about privilege and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have special privileges granted to</v>

1015
00:43:41.271 --> 00:43:46.271
<v Speaker 2>you by the constitution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all have rights and when people try </v>

1016
00:43:46.271 --> 00:43:50.831
<v Speaker 2>to pretend that a privilege or a group </v>
<v Speaker 2>privilege and try to give that the </v>

1017
00:43:50.831 --> 00:43:53.660
<v Speaker 2>status of a right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you talked about it on your,</v>

1018
00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:58.720
<v Speaker 2>on your podcast when we had the supreme </v>
<v Speaker 2>court ruling recently regarding the gay </v>

1019
00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:03.050
<v Speaker 2>couple that wanted a wedding cake and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1020
00:44:03.230 --> 00:44:08.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they sued because the baker wouldn't </v>

1021
00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:12.281
<v Speaker 2>make a wedding cake with a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys on the top and decorated in a way </v>

1022
00:44:12.281 --> 00:44:16.901
<v Speaker 2>that it was obviously for a gay wedding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a bottom is understanding about </v>

1023
00:44:16.901 --> 00:44:21.881
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've read something recently that </v>

1024
00:44:21.881 --> 00:44:23.350
<v Speaker 2>not only did they not do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they weren't making custom cakes so </v>

1025
00:44:23.661 --> 00:44:25.490
<v Speaker 2>they didn't make custom cakes for </v>
<v Speaker 2>weddings.</v>

1026
00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:27.010
<v Speaker 2>So when these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1027
00:44:27.030 --> 00:44:29.470
<v Speaker 2>the gay couple came in so they wanted a </v>
<v Speaker 2>custom cake.</v>

1028
00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:29.840
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1029
00:44:29.841 --> 00:44:34.841
<v Speaker 2>we don't make that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that was also part of the problem </v>

1030
00:44:34.841 --> 00:44:34.841
<v Speaker 2>was they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not something they even did.</v>

1031
00:44:34.841 --> 00:44:38.050
<v Speaker 2>They could've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would've sold them a cake theory had one</v>

1032
00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:39.520
<v Speaker 2>or two dudes holding hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1033
00:44:39.540 --> 00:44:43.110
<v Speaker 2>the bigger problem is first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they.</v>

1034
00:44:43.111 --> 00:44:48.111
<v Speaker 2>It's not like you have this gay couple </v>
<v Speaker 2>that just went into a bakery and then </v>

1035
00:44:48.111 --> 00:44:50.130
<v Speaker 2>they were denied the ability to buy a </v>
<v Speaker 2>cake.</v>

1036
00:44:50.370 --> 00:44:55.370
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They probably went to 100 bakeries to </v>

1037
00:44:55.370 --> 00:44:56.230
<v Speaker 2>find the one that wouldn't make the </v>
<v Speaker 2>vacation specifically do that.</v>

1038
00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:59.700
<v Speaker 2>Part of the story was that they wanted </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone to deny them.</v>

1039
00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:01.200
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And had a story.</v>

1040
00:45:01.250 --> 00:45:02.430
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course,</v>

1041
00:45:02.450 --> 00:45:03.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're a baker,</v>

1042
00:45:03.930 --> 00:45:04.360
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1043
00:45:04.361 --> 00:45:06.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the margins are on </v>
<v Speaker 2>wedding cakes,</v>

1044
00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:09.360
<v Speaker 2>but wedding cakes are probably like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>holy grail of cakes,</v>

1045
00:45:09.361 --> 00:45:09.570
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1046
00:45:09.570 --> 00:45:09.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're.</v>

1047
00:45:10.170 --> 00:45:12.120
<v Speaker 2>If you're sitting there on the small </v>
<v Speaker 2>bakery shop,</v>

1048
00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:17.510
<v Speaker 2>you're waiting for somebody to call for </v>
<v Speaker 2>a wedding cake because those are the </v>

1049
00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:18.570
<v Speaker 2>biggest case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could make very expensive cake.</v>

1050
00:45:18.571 --> 00:45:22.640
<v Speaker 2>So everybody wants to do a wedding cake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody cares whether there's two guys or</v>

1051
00:45:22.641 --> 00:45:27.641
<v Speaker 2>a guy and a girl on the top of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just want to make the money that </v>

1052
00:45:27.641 --> 00:45:27.641
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get from baking wedding </v>
<v Speaker 2>cake.</v>

1053
00:45:27.641 --> 00:45:31.470
<v Speaker 2>Now you come across a guy who just has a</v>
<v Speaker 2>strong religious conviction.</v>

1054
00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:33.110
<v Speaker 2>He just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1055
00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:36.330
<v Speaker 2>doesn't want to bake a cake for a gay </v>
<v Speaker 2>wedding.</v>

1056
00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:37.530
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1057
00:45:37.531 --> 00:45:39.550
<v Speaker 2>he's the one that's losing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's losing out on the,</v>

1058
00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:40.170
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1059
00:45:40.171 --> 00:45:43.380
<v Speaker 2>the commission to bake the cake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1060
00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:48.240
<v Speaker 2>the gay couple isn't hurt by that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so many bakeries that would bake</v>

1061
00:45:48.241 --> 00:45:50.640
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That cake was this couple.</v>

1062
00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:53.010
<v Speaker 2>Were they denied because of religious </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasons?</v>

1063
00:45:53.010 --> 00:45:54.720
<v Speaker 2>Is that why the people said they </v>
<v Speaker 2>weren't,</v>

1064
00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:56.270
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't make the case that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1065
00:45:56.280 --> 00:46:01.280
<v Speaker 2>they said it was religious reasons and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what the supreme court I think </v>

1066
00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:02.040
<v Speaker 2>went on religious freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as far as I'm concerned,</v>

1067
00:46:02.070 --> 00:46:03.540
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter what their religion </v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

1068
00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:09.140
<v Speaker 2>Nobody is required to perform a service </v>
<v Speaker 2>for somebody else if they don't want to.</v>

1069
00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:12.450
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if it was a black couple?</v>

1070
00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:17.480
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what if these people are racist and </v>

1071
00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:17.850
<v Speaker 2>what have they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't want to bake a cake for a Black</v>

1072
00:46:17.850 --> 00:46:19.710
<v Speaker 2>Cup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well then the black couple can go find a</v>

1073
00:46:19.711 --> 00:46:21.540
<v Speaker 2>bakery that we'll bake them a cake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1074
00:46:21.870 --> 00:46:25.860
<v Speaker 2>what's the odds of there being a racist </v>
<v Speaker 2>Baker out there?</v>

1075
00:46:25.890 --> 00:46:26.370
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1076
00:46:26.371 --> 00:46:28.740
<v Speaker 2>I mentioned if I was today's Day and </v>
<v Speaker 2>age,</v>

1077
00:46:28.741 --> 00:46:30.350
<v Speaker 2>it's less than ever before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1078
00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:31.470
<v Speaker 2>But let's look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

1079
00:46:31.590 --> 00:46:32.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's still possible,</v>

1080
00:46:32.611 --> 00:46:33.570
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm Jewish,</v>

1081
00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:33.960
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1082
00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:36.690
<v Speaker 2>Let's say there's an anti Semite Baker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1083
00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:40.890
<v Speaker 2>And if he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I go in there and the guy says,</v>

1084
00:46:41.350 --> 00:46:42.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1085
00:46:42.001 --> 00:46:44.490
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to bake cake for Jews,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fine,</v>

1086
00:46:44.710 --> 00:46:49.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because let's assume that he knows I'm </v>

1087
00:46:49.710 --> 00:46:49.800
<v Speaker 2>Jewish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He hates Jews and he spits in the cake.</v>

1088
00:46:49.830 --> 00:46:51.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to know,</v>

1089
00:46:51.341 --> 00:46:55.410
<v Speaker 2>like right up front that this guy who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>about to bake my cake hates Jews.</v>

1090
00:46:55.470 --> 00:46:58.740
<v Speaker 2>So then I'll go and buy my cake from </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody who doesn't hate Jews because I</v>

1091
00:46:58.741 --> 00:47:01.530
<v Speaker 2>don't want to worry about what I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be putting them in my mouth.</v>

1092
00:47:01.531 --> 00:47:06.531
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would you want to even force </v>

1093
00:47:06.531 --> 00:47:08.810
<v Speaker 2>somebody to bake a cake for you that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to eat if you're forcing it </v>

1094
00:47:08.810 --> 00:47:10.140
<v Speaker 2>to do it or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is all nonsense.</v>

1095
00:47:10.141 --> 00:47:10.900
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1096
00:47:11.050 --> 00:47:15.210
<v Speaker 2>the idea that you can't discriminate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can't make choices,</v>

1097
00:47:15.211 --> 00:47:15.390
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1098
00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:15.900
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1099
00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:19.670
<v Speaker 2>I have a right as an individual to um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1100
00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:22.680
<v Speaker 2>to do things that I want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can't force somebody else.</v>

1101
00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:28.100
<v Speaker 2>Writes are about big government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could you can't rob from me and you </v>

1102
00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:30.760
<v Speaker 2>can't steal from me so you can't take </v>
<v Speaker 2>away from me something that I have,</v>

1103
00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:36.060
<v Speaker 2>but I can't force you to give me </v>
<v Speaker 2>something I don't have and just because </v>

1104
00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:37.260
<v Speaker 2>I feel a certain way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you go back to the,</v>

1105
00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:38.030
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1106
00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:39.340
<v Speaker 2>the gay couple to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1107
00:47:39.341 --> 00:47:42.230
<v Speaker 2>you can't discriminate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did the Supreme Court ruling that by</v>

1108
00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:42.550
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1109
00:47:42.551 --> 00:47:43.000
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1110
00:47:43.010 --> 00:47:45.940
<v Speaker 2>they uphold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>held the right of this individual,</v>

1111
00:47:45.941 --> 00:47:48.640
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't like a real individual to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get.</v>

1112
00:47:48.940 --> 00:47:52.210
<v Speaker 2>But I think it had to do with some </v>
<v Speaker 2>esoteric state law.</v>

1113
00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:56.920
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't a definitive ruling that says </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you have a right to discriminate,</v>

1114
00:47:56.921 --> 00:47:58.600
<v Speaker 2>which I believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe you do.</v>

1115
00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:01.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't think the government should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>discriminating but private individuals.</v>

1116
00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:03.910
<v Speaker 2>But the point I was about to make is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1117
00:48:03.911 --> 00:48:04.410
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

1118
00:48:04.450 --> 00:48:06.760
<v Speaker 2>for gay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's say that you,</v>

1119
00:48:06.820 --> 00:48:08.260
<v Speaker 2>Joe Rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

1120
00:48:08.590 --> 00:48:13.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm working as a Gigolo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was your job.</v>

1121
00:48:13.270 --> 00:48:16.760
<v Speaker 2>You just had sex with women and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>charge them money nights.</v>

1122
00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:17.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's your job.</v>

1123
00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:20.890
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if a dude comes up to you and wants</v>

1124
00:48:20.891 --> 00:48:24.220
<v Speaker 2>to partake in your services?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have to serve him?</v>

1125
00:48:24.820 --> 00:48:26.170
<v Speaker 2>That's not the job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sir.</v>

1126
00:48:26.370 --> 00:48:27.600
<v Speaker 2>The job was women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1127
00:48:27.601 --> 00:48:28.810
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't discriminate.</v>

1128
00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:30.670
<v Speaker 2>What's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my point.</v>

1129
00:48:30.671 --> 00:48:33.370
<v Speaker 2>Discriminate in terms of having sex with</v>
<v Speaker 2>men.</v>

1130
00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:35.120
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not if you're doing it for business.</v>

1131
00:48:35.230 --> 00:48:37.770
<v Speaker 2>If it's your business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now my job is Gigolo.</v>

1132
00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:39.920
<v Speaker 2>Gigolo was a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has sex with women.</v>

1133
00:48:39.930 --> 00:48:42.220
<v Speaker 2>I know that's the job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're asking a firefighter to</v>

1134
00:48:42.221 --> 00:48:45.520
<v Speaker 2>dig a hole for the Gigolo is a guy that </v>
<v Speaker 2>has sex for money.</v>

1135
00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:47.530
<v Speaker 2>It matter whether it's a guy or a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1136
00:48:47.550 --> 00:48:49.470
<v Speaker 2>that's the point though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Women Bro.</v>

1137
00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:51.040
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then your business card,</v>

1138
00:48:51.041 --> 00:48:52.780
<v Speaker 2>but then you're discriminating against </v>
<v Speaker 2>men.</v>

1139
00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:56.320
<v Speaker 2>How could you deny?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How could you deny a man the opportunity</v>

1140
00:48:56.321 --> 00:48:58.060
<v Speaker 2>to have sex with you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

1141
00:48:58.210 --> 00:49:00.130
<v Speaker 2>Sees the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't look and you can say,</v>

1142
00:49:00.131 --> 00:49:01.660
<v Speaker 2>what if?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if it's not sex?</v>

1143
00:49:01.661 --> 00:49:02.660
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's mess.</v>

1144

<v Speaker 2>If you're a business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want your business to be limited.</v>

00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:24.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

1154
00:49:24.310 --> 00:49:24.900
<v Speaker 2>But why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

1155
00:49:24.940 --> 00:49:28.240
<v Speaker 2>but you should have a right to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then once you extrapolate it,</v>

1156
00:49:28.241 --> 00:49:29.560
<v Speaker 2>you just make a decision.</v>

1157
00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:34.560
<v Speaker 2>Now you could make more money if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>massage girls and guys because you have </v>

1158
00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:38.821
<v Speaker 2>a bigger market.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you want to limit your business </v>

1159
00:49:38.821 --> 00:49:39.070
<v Speaker 2>opportunity to just women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that hurts you.</v>

1160
00:49:39.220 --> 00:49:41.290
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then it's your right to do that.</v>

1161
00:49:41.530 --> 00:49:46.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a massage therapist that doesn't </v>

1162
00:49:46.530 --> 00:49:47.080
<v Speaker 2>want a massage guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You never hear about those and you don't</v>

1163
00:49:47.081 --> 00:49:49.450
<v Speaker 2>get offended.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Men Don't get offended by that.</v>

1164
00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:52.780
<v Speaker 2>Guys want massage me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1165
00:49:52.781 --> 00:49:54.210
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could do it as a,</v>

1166
00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:55.620
<v Speaker 2>as a customer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1167
00:49:55.621 --> 00:49:55.960
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1168
00:49:55.961 --> 00:49:59.260
<v Speaker 2>let's just say I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want a massage and I can say,</v>

1169
00:49:59.261 --> 00:50:01.120
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I prefer to get a massage by a woman.</v>

1170
00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:06.360
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean most guys would probably prefer </v>

1171
00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:06.360
<v Speaker 2>to get a massage by a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1172
00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:06.760
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that that that's totally legal.</v>

1173
00:50:06.820 --> 00:50:09.850
<v Speaker 2>They always let the customer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the customer can discriminate.</v>

1174
00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:12.130
<v Speaker 2>The employee can discriminate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1175
00:50:12.130 --> 00:50:13.640
<v Speaker 2>Nobody would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1176
00:50:13.690 --> 00:50:14.260
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I,</v>

1177
00:50:14.410 --> 00:50:18.520
<v Speaker 2>let's say I happen to be black and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to work for a black boss,</v>

1178
00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:24.000
<v Speaker 2>nobody would say that was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could go to a white boss and I could </v>

1179
00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:24.000
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1180
00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:28.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to take the job because I </v>

1181
00:50:28.580 --> 00:50:28.580
<v Speaker 2>want to work for some in black bay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You sue me for not breaking.</v>

1182
00:50:28.580 --> 00:50:31.430
<v Speaker 2>You're actively seeking out a black </v>
<v Speaker 2>boss,</v>

1183
00:50:31.490 --> 00:50:36.490
<v Speaker 2>which is the difference between that and</v>
<v Speaker 2>being approached by a bunch of white </v>

1184
00:50:36.490 --> 00:50:36.490
<v Speaker 2>people and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1185
00:50:36.490 --> 00:50:36.490
<v Speaker 2>I hate white people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1186
00:50:36.490 --> 00:50:36.890
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1187
00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:37.790
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The point is,</v>

1188
00:50:37.791 --> 00:50:41.060
<v Speaker 2>if a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if a white person or even a black person</v>

1189
00:50:41.061 --> 00:50:44.160
<v Speaker 2>was seeking out a job application of </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

1190
00:50:44.420 --> 00:50:46.760
<v Speaker 2>they would say that's illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't discriminate,</v>

1191
00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:49.570
<v Speaker 2>but the employer can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the employee can do it all.</v>

1192
00:50:49.571 --> 00:50:51.800
<v Speaker 2>He was right customers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1193
00:50:51.801 --> 00:50:53.840
<v Speaker 2>If I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I was a.</v>

1194
00:50:54.100 --> 00:50:59.100
<v Speaker 2>If a gay couple wanted to have a cake </v>
<v Speaker 2>baked and I went and they went into a </v>

1195
00:50:59.100 --> 00:51:01.790
<v Speaker 2>bakery and they said yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd like to have a cake bake,</v>

1196
00:51:01.791 --> 00:51:06.740
<v Speaker 2>are you straight or gay because we want </v>
<v Speaker 2>our cake to be baked by a gay baker,</v>

1197
00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:08.210
<v Speaker 2>and the straight guy said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1198
00:51:08.211 --> 00:51:09.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm straight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

1199
00:51:09.081 --> 00:51:13.430
<v Speaker 2>They find they can keep searching until </v>
<v Speaker 2>they found the gay and no one would say,</v>

1200
00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:16.190
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not saying that we should make </v>
<v Speaker 2>that illegal.</v>

1201
00:51:16.191 --> 00:51:18.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying the laws should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>consistent.</v>

1202
00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:23.500
<v Speaker 2>That means that is interesting that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>employer or rather the customer can </v>

1203
00:51:23.500 --> 00:51:27.911
<v Speaker 2>basically go wherever they like and no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one says you didn't go into this </v>

1204
00:51:27.911 --> 00:51:31.631
<v Speaker 2>restaurant because you don't like gay </v>
<v Speaker 2>people because gay people run this </v>

1205
00:51:31.631 --> 00:51:31.631
<v Speaker 2>restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody ever says that.</v>

1206
00:51:31.631 --> 00:51:33.500
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they can't force you to eat there if</v>

1207
00:51:33.501 --> 00:51:35.660
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to go the other way.</v>

1208
00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:40.660
<v Speaker 2>They can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can force you to use or to have </v>

1209
00:51:40.660 --> 00:51:42.840
<v Speaker 2>someone use your services even if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't believe in what they stand.</v>

1210
00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:43.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they.</v>

1211
00:51:43.510 --> 00:51:45.830
<v Speaker 2>And then the left always tries to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>it out.</v>

1212
00:51:45.831 --> 00:51:47.510
<v Speaker 2>Like if you have this perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1213
00:51:47.511 --> 00:51:48.200
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1214
00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:50.330
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you must be a racist if you believe that</v>

1215
00:51:50.331 --> 00:51:52.190
<v Speaker 2>people have a right to discriminate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

1216
00:51:52.420 --> 00:51:53.240
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1217
00:51:53.450 --> 00:51:58.450
<v Speaker 2>I believe that people have a right to </v>
<v Speaker 2>say a lot of things that I disagree </v>

1218
00:51:58.450 --> 00:52:01.631
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to stop them from saying </v>

1219
00:52:01.631 --> 00:52:01.631
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1220
00:52:01.631 --> 00:52:02.180
<v Speaker 2>I believe in free speech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if what you're saying is idiotic or</v>

1221
00:52:02.181 --> 00:52:07.181
<v Speaker 2>offensive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I believe people ever right to </v>

1222
00:52:07.181 --> 00:52:10.061
<v Speaker 2>discriminate against it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The bigger problem is when the </v>

1223
00:52:10.061 --> 00:52:12.701
<v Speaker 2>government becomes the thought police </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the minute you make it illegal </v>

1224
00:52:12.701 --> 00:52:14.060
<v Speaker 2>to discriminate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now you have to get into people's minds,</v>

1225
00:52:14.061 --> 00:52:19.061
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If somebody doesn't promote somebody or </v>

1226
00:52:19.061 --> 00:52:22.481
<v Speaker 2>fire somebody and they happened to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>black or a woman or too old or </v>

1227
00:52:22.671 --> 00:52:24.710
<v Speaker 2>handicapped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you assume their motive,</v>

1228
00:52:24.740 --> 00:52:25.730
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now you're going to say,</v>

1229
00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:30.760
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you fired that person a b because he's </v>

1230
00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:33.911
<v Speaker 2>black,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what if that had nothing to do with </v>

1231
00:52:33.911 --> 00:52:33.911
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>

1232
00:52:33.911 --> 00:52:35.520
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're assuming the motive for firing </v>

1233
00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:37.181
<v Speaker 2>people and now I got to prove that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't do something for what I was </v>

1234
00:52:37.181 --> 00:52:37.181
<v Speaker 2>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I did.</v>

1235
00:52:37.181 --> 00:52:37.181
<v Speaker 2>Something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1236
00:52:37.430 --> 00:52:38.630
<v Speaker 2>none of that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1237
00:52:38.660 --> 00:52:42.230
<v Speaker 2>All of that too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes it so much harder for employers.</v>

1238
00:52:42.290 --> 00:52:43.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at what just happened.</v>

1239
00:52:43.221 --> 00:52:44.750
<v Speaker 2>This isn't race,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's part of it.</v>

1240
00:52:44.910 --> 00:52:46.170
<v Speaker 2>Do you see that story?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1241
00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:51.760
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other day about trump's driver is </v>

1242
00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:52.160
<v Speaker 2>suing him for overtime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1243
00:52:52.161 --> 00:52:52.970
<v Speaker 2>I did see that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1244
00:52:52.971 --> 00:52:57.410
<v Speaker 2>So this guy worked for the trump </v>
<v Speaker 2>organization for like 25 years,</v>

1245
00:52:57.680 --> 00:53:02.680
<v Speaker 2>drive into his personal driver for </v>
<v Speaker 2>Donald Trump and he's now suing him </v>

1246
00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:07.270
<v Speaker 2>because he claims that he worked more </v>
<v Speaker 2>than 40 hours a week and so he wants </v>

1247
00:53:07.270 --> 00:53:09.380
<v Speaker 2>more money right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course he worked for 25 years.</v>

1248
00:53:09.410 --> 00:53:12.560
<v Speaker 2>Why didn't he ask for a raise like </v>
<v Speaker 2>during those 25 years?</v>

1249
00:53:12.561 --> 00:53:15.230
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But apparently his job,</v>

1250
00:53:15.231 --> 00:53:17.900
<v Speaker 2>he had to be on call for maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1251
00:53:17.901 --> 00:53:19.280
<v Speaker 2>10 hours a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1252
00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:22.580
<v Speaker 2>And an on call doesn't mean he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually driving.</v>

1253
00:53:22.610 --> 00:53:25.500
<v Speaker 2>He just had to be available to trump if </v>
<v Speaker 2>trump needed them,</v>

1254
00:53:25.950 --> 00:53:26.160
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

1255
00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:26.590
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1256
00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:29.580
<v Speaker 3>he could be on the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he could be watching a movie,</v>

1257
00:53:29.581 --> 00:53:31.300
<v Speaker 3>it could be reading the books and in </v>
<v Speaker 3>emails,</v>

1258
00:53:31.301 --> 00:53:32.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>traded stocks,</v>

1259
00:53:32.281 --> 00:53:34.510
<v Speaker 3>whatever he wants to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's not like it was that,</v>

1260
00:53:34.550 --> 00:53:39.550
<v Speaker 3>like he was really working,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he had to be available so he </v>

1261
00:53:39.550 --> 00:53:39.550
<v Speaker 3>couldn't go out of town.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1262
00:53:39.580 --> 00:53:41.760
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's going back and he says that,</v>

1263
00:53:41.761 --> 00:53:46.761
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had to be available for more than 40 </v>

1264
00:53:46.761 --> 00:53:49.251
<v Speaker 3>hours a week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well maybe it was 50 hours a week or 55 </v>

1265
00:53:49.251 --> 00:53:50.250
<v Speaker 3>hours a week and now he wants back pay </v>
<v Speaker 3>time and a half.</v>

1266
00:53:50.251 --> 00:53:52.170
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because overtime laws say you got to get</v>

1267
00:53:52.171 --> 00:53:53.760
<v Speaker 3>time and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But first of all,</v>

1268
00:53:54.030 --> 00:53:56.940
<v Speaker 3>he wasn't even an hourly worker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guy collected a salary,</v>

1269
00:53:56.941 --> 00:53:59.100
<v Speaker 3>something like 65,</v>
<v Speaker 3>$70,000</v>

1270
00:53:59.101 --> 00:54:04.101
<v Speaker 3>a year was his salary and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he knew what the salary was when he took</v>

1271
00:54:04.951 --> 00:54:05.460
<v Speaker 3>the job.</v>

1272
00:54:05.730 --> 00:54:07.770
<v Speaker 3>He knew what the hours were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If he didn't like it,</v>

1273
00:54:07.860 --> 00:54:12.860
<v Speaker 3>he could have said something to trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He could have demanded higher pay or he </v>

1274
00:54:12.860 --> 00:54:12.860
<v Speaker 3>could have quit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1275
00:54:12.930 --> 00:54:17.930
<v Speaker 3>But instead he works without complaint.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then 25 years later files a big </v>

1276
00:54:17.930 --> 00:54:21.560
<v Speaker 3>lawsuit now the toys out of work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now he's working there.</v>

1277
00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:22.920
<v Speaker 3>He's still working.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There he is.</v>

1278
00:54:22.980 --> 00:54:26.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's suing Balis working in which,</v>

1279
00:54:26.101 --> 00:54:27.450
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then of course,</v>

1280
00:54:27.451 --> 00:54:29.100
<v Speaker 3>if you fire them when they sue you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

1281
00:54:29.101 --> 00:54:30.990
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's retaliation that it makes it worse.</v>

1282
00:54:31.290 --> 00:54:32.950
<v Speaker 3>But the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1283
00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:35.130
<v Speaker 3>trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got a lot of money.</v>

1284
00:54:35.131 --> 00:54:36.330
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he can deal with this,</v>

1285
00:54:36.540 --> 00:54:39.270
<v Speaker 3>but your average small businessman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1286
00:54:39.570 --> 00:54:42.090
<v Speaker 3>this kind of stuff kills you when people</v>
<v Speaker 3>start suing you,</v>

1287
00:54:42.510 --> 00:54:46.680
<v Speaker 3>it costs a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of that happens too with um,</v>

1288
00:54:46.710 --> 00:54:47.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1289
00:54:47.151 --> 00:54:48.810
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the discrimination laws,</v>

1290
00:54:48.811 --> 00:54:53.811
<v Speaker 3>I mean because a small business owners </v>
<v Speaker 3>are so concerned about getting sued that</v>

1291
00:54:54.061 --> 00:54:57.240
<v Speaker 3>they try to hire people that they think </v>
<v Speaker 3>are less likely to sue them.</v>

1292
00:54:57.240 --> 00:55:02.240
<v Speaker 3>And then it ends up backfiring because </v>
<v Speaker 3>it works against all the people who are </v>

1293
00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:04.030
<v Speaker 3>protected classes who are now able to </v>
<v Speaker 3>sue you.</v>

1294
00:55:04.260 --> 00:55:09.260
<v Speaker 3>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I also wanted to point out on the </v>

1295
00:55:09.260 --> 00:55:09.260
<v Speaker 3>overtime laws because so many people </v>
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>

1296
00:55:09.260 --> 00:55:09.840
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is terrible,</v>

1297
00:55:09.841 --> 00:55:11.250
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he should pay overtime.</v>

1298
00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:16.560
<v Speaker 3>Overtime is those laws are probably some</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the worst laws out there because they</v>

1299
00:55:17.281 --> 00:55:18.990
<v Speaker 3>don't protect workers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1300
00:55:18.991 --> 00:55:23.991
<v Speaker 3>Because what happens is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say you got a job and you're </v>

1301
00:55:23.991 --> 00:55:26.790
<v Speaker 3>working 40 hours a week and you're an </v>
<v Speaker 3>hourly worker and you want,</v>

1302
00:55:26.820 --> 00:55:28.650
<v Speaker 3>you want more hours,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want more money.</v>

1303
00:55:29.210 --> 00:55:30.360
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe you want to,</v>

1304
00:55:30.361 --> 00:55:30.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1305
00:55:30.871 --> 00:55:35.871
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to track the higher </v>
<v Speaker 3>caliber of girls who try to get more </v>

1306
00:55:35.871 --> 00:55:35.871
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to work more hours,</v>

1307
00:55:35.871 --> 00:55:39.860
<v Speaker 3>so sexist what you just said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So say in a blog so you can tell it.</v>

1308
00:55:39.930 --> 00:55:41.490
<v Speaker 3>You tell your boss,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1309
00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:44.040
<v Speaker 3>can I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can I work an extra 10 hours a week?</v>

1310
00:55:44.100 --> 00:55:45.450
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to get some.</v>

1311
00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:47.160
<v Speaker 3>I want to get some.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to make some more money.</v>

1312
00:55:47.161 --> 00:55:49.200
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well your boss says,</v>

1313
00:55:49.201 --> 00:55:54.201
<v Speaker 3>well I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to let you work an extra 10 </v>

1314
00:55:54.201 --> 00:55:54.201
<v Speaker 3>hours,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I have to pay a time and a half.</v>

1315
00:55:54.201 --> 00:55:55.050
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the guys look,</v>

1316
00:55:55.051 --> 00:56:00.051
<v Speaker 3>well I don't need time and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll just work 10 hours for the same </v>

1317
00:56:00.051 --> 00:56:00.051
<v Speaker 3>pay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's illegal.</v>

1318
00:56:00.051 --> 00:56:01.200
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would like to do it,</v>

1319
00:56:01.590 --> 00:56:03.000
<v Speaker 3>but I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if the,</v>

1320
00:56:03.090 --> 00:56:08.090
<v Speaker 3>if that boss needs extra workers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he has to go bring on a part time </v>

1321
00:56:08.090 --> 00:56:11.781
<v Speaker 3>worker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now let's say if I want to get an </v>

1322
00:56:11.781 --> 00:56:13.710
<v Speaker 3>extra 10 hours work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to find another job someplace else</v>

1323
00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:16.390
<v Speaker 3>where I can work part time where the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1324
00:56:16.420 --> 00:56:21.420
<v Speaker 3>the time and a half law doesn't apply.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But now I got to get from my full time </v>

1325
00:56:21.871 --> 00:56:23.980
<v Speaker 3>job to my part time job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How long does that</v>

1326
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:25.480
<v Speaker 2>take me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How common is this though?</v>

1327
00:56:25.481 --> 00:56:28.470
<v Speaker 2>That people are denying people extra </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

1328
00:56:28.471 --> 00:56:31.170
<v Speaker 2>It's very needed because they don't want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to pay the time of the half.</v>

1329
00:56:31.210 --> 00:56:32.170
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it happens all the time.</v>

1330
00:56:32.171 --> 00:56:34.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where moonlighting came from.</v>

1331
00:56:34.241 --> 00:56:39.241
<v Speaker 2>That's the whole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean obviously people you're going to </v>

1332
00:56:39.241 --> 00:56:41.880
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can have people that worked for two </v>

1333
00:56:41.880 --> 00:56:41.880
<v Speaker 2>employers and then other people working </v>
<v Speaker 2>in there.</v>

1334
00:56:41.880 --> 00:56:43.840
<v Speaker 2>They're going back and forth between the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same company.</v>

1335
00:56:43.841 --> 00:56:47.380
<v Speaker 2>So what you're saying is it's weird if </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone has to work extra hours,</v>

1336
00:56:47.381 --> 00:56:51.040
<v Speaker 2>why you paying them double the money or </v>
<v Speaker 2>time and a half,</v>

1337
00:56:51.070 --> 00:56:53.440
<v Speaker 2>five and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why paying the extra money?</v>

1338
00:56:53.441 --> 00:56:58.441
<v Speaker 2>Because they're doing just just because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're working more than eight hours a </v>

1339
00:56:58.441 --> 00:56:58.441
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1340
00:56:58.441 --> 00:57:03.000
<v Speaker 2>but the thing is the employer doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to pay the extra and he doesn't </v>

1341
00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:03.250
<v Speaker 2>have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he can hire somebody part time,</v>

1342
00:57:03.251 --> 00:57:06.820
<v Speaker 2>but the point is that all of these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1343
00:57:07.140 --> 00:57:07.640
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1344
00:57:07.780 --> 00:57:12.780
<v Speaker 2>the details of employment should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>negotiated by the employer and the </v>

1345
00:57:13.241 --> 00:57:14.860
<v Speaker 2>employee that government should stay out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of it,</v>

1346
00:57:15.310 --> 00:57:17.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that time and a half is a government</v>

1347
00:57:17.201 --> 00:57:17.470
<v Speaker 2>law.</v>

1348
00:57:17.530 --> 00:57:19.200
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's nationwide yet.</v>

1349
00:57:19.570 --> 00:57:24.570
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different states can have different </v>

1350
00:57:24.570 --> 00:57:25.230
<v Speaker 2>rules and federally they have different </v>
<v Speaker 2>rules over what constitutes a,</v>

1351
00:57:25.290 --> 00:57:28.840
<v Speaker 2>how much pay do you have to earn before </v>
<v Speaker 2>the overtime rules apply.</v>

1352
00:57:28.900 --> 00:57:33.900
<v Speaker 2>What's also isn't a pretty arbitrary </v>
<v Speaker 2>like this decision that's 40 hours a </v>

1353
00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:33.900
<v Speaker 2>week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1354
00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:33.900
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1355
00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:34.810
<v Speaker 2>everything the government does is </v>
<v Speaker 2>arbitrary.</v>

1356
00:57:34.811 --> 00:57:36.970
<v Speaker 2>That's what laws are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to come up with a number.</v>

1357
00:57:37.210 --> 00:57:41.570
<v Speaker 2>But all of this should be free for </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussion.</v>

1358
00:57:41.571 --> 00:57:46.571
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting because you have the </v>

1359
00:57:46.571 --> 00:57:46.571
<v Speaker 2>liberals believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1360
00:57:46.571 --> 00:57:48.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two people should be able to,</v>

1361
00:57:48.410 --> 00:57:49.050
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1362
00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:51.700
<v Speaker 2>have a relationship without the </v>
<v Speaker 2>government interfering,</v>

1363
00:57:51.860 --> 00:57:52.370
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1364
00:57:52.570 --> 00:57:54.110
<v Speaker 2>they can have a sexual relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1365
00:57:54.280 --> 00:57:56.370
<v Speaker 2>it's none of the government's business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1366
00:57:56.380 --> 00:57:57.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who you're,</v>

1367
00:57:57.351 --> 00:57:58.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're sleeping with well,</v>

1368
00:57:58.991 --> 00:58:03.991
<v Speaker 2>why don't they have the same belief in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same freedom when it comes to </v>

1369
00:58:03.991 --> 00:58:04.030
<v Speaker 2>economic relationships.</v>

1370
00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:07.060
<v Speaker 2>If an employee and employer or having a </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship,</v>

1371
00:58:07.090 --> 00:58:12.090
<v Speaker 2>why doesn't the government just butt out</v>
<v Speaker 2>and let the employer and the employee </v>

1372
00:58:12.090 --> 00:58:15.990
<v Speaker 2>negotiate the relationship and the terms</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the relationship that they think is </v>

1373
00:58:15.990 --> 00:58:18.040
<v Speaker 2>best for them because there are a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>workers that,</v>

1374
00:58:18.100 --> 00:58:19.450
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't need the overtime,</v>

1375
00:58:19.451 --> 00:58:24.100
<v Speaker 2>but maybe there's another benefit that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>would prefer to have a that I could get,</v>

1376
00:58:24.101 --> 00:58:27.610
<v Speaker 2>but I can't because of government laws </v>
<v Speaker 2>are requiring things that I don't want.</v>

1377
00:58:28.180 --> 00:58:33.180
<v Speaker 2>So you're against minimum wage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're against essentially all these </v>

1378
00:58:33.180 --> 00:58:34.150
<v Speaker 2>government regulations in terms of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you paid.</v>

1379
00:58:34.390 --> 00:58:38.030
<v Speaker 2>The minimum wage is probably the dumbest</v>
<v Speaker 2>law that we talked about that on the,</v>

1380
00:58:38.090 --> 00:58:40.690
<v Speaker 2>on the last podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's probably the dumbest law,</v>

1381
00:58:41.110 --> 00:58:43.810
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can come up with because all it</v>

1382
00:58:43.811 --> 00:58:48.811
<v Speaker 2>does is hurt the very people that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>are intending to help you.</v>

1383
00:58:50.110 --> 00:58:52.750
<v Speaker 2>You're hurting the least skilled people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A,</v>

1384
00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:56.650
<v Speaker 2>you're preventing people from getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>jobs in the first place and you're,</v>

1385
00:58:56.680 --> 00:59:00.910
<v Speaker 2>you're creating extra incentives for </v>
<v Speaker 2>employers to eliminate jobs,</v>

1386
00:59:00.911 --> 00:59:04.990
<v Speaker 2>to try to use capital instead of labor </v>
<v Speaker 2>to try to outsource.</v>

1387
00:59:04.991 --> 00:59:09.991
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody is going to hire somebody if </v>

1388
00:59:09.991 --> 00:59:09.991
<v Speaker 2>they're losing money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1389
00:59:09.991 --> 00:59:14.881
<v Speaker 2>People have a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>productivity that they can bring to the </v>

1390
00:59:14.881 --> 00:59:18.190
<v Speaker 2>table and when an employer makes a </v>
<v Speaker 2>decision on who to hire,</v>

1391
00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:22.430
<v Speaker 2>they have to hire somebody that brings </v>
<v Speaker 2>them at least enough productivity</v>

1392
00:59:22.430 --> 00:59:24.180
<v Speaker 3>to cover the wages.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1393
00:59:24.310 --> 00:59:26.220
<v Speaker 3>and so what happens is when you haven't </v>
<v Speaker 3>been in waves,</v>

1394
00:59:26.221 --> 00:59:31.221
<v Speaker 3>let's say the minimum wage is $8 an hour</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm an unskilled worker and I have </v>

1395
00:59:32.211 --> 00:59:34.910
<v Speaker 3>to convince an employer to pay me $8 an </v>
<v Speaker 3>hour.</v>

1396
00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:40.120
<v Speaker 3>I have to also convince him that I can </v>
<v Speaker 3>deliver more than $8 an hour of </v>

1397
00:59:40.120 --> 00:59:43.040
<v Speaker 3>productivity to his organization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if I can't do that,</v>

1398
00:59:43.041 --> 00:59:44.540
<v Speaker 3>I can't get a job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1399
00:59:44.541 --> 00:59:47.420
<v Speaker 3>what if I can only bring $5 of </v>
<v Speaker 3>productivity?</v>

1400
00:59:47.990 --> 00:59:49.430
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that means you can't get hired.</v>

1401
00:59:49.850 --> 00:59:51.100
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if I could,</v>

1402
00:59:51.110 --> 00:59:56.110
<v Speaker 3>if I only have $5 an hour worth of </v>
<v Speaker 3>skills and I can't get a job to improve </v>

1403
00:59:56.110 --> 00:59:58.850
<v Speaker 3>my skills,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm stuck in unemployment forever.</v>

1404
00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:04.000
<v Speaker 3>I mean the worst thing you can do to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy with minimal skills is prevent them </v>

1405
01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:08.141
<v Speaker 3>from getting a job because it's the job </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's going to enable them to increase </v>

1406
01:00:08.141 --> 01:00:08.990
<v Speaker 3>their skills so they can earn more money</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the future.</v>

1407
01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:14.240
<v Speaker 4>I know what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the idea is that if you have a </v>

1408
01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:14.640
<v Speaker 4>minimum amount that you allow people to </v>
<v Speaker 4>pay the least.</v>

1409
01:00:14.641 --> 01:00:19.641
<v Speaker 4>The people that are working for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>company will have a real income where </v>

1410
01:00:19.641 --> 01:00:21.660
<v Speaker 4>they can pay their bills and feed </v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves and that this company,</v>

1411
01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:26.900
<v Speaker 4>because they have all the power,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have all the money and a poor </v>

1412
01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:28.660
<v Speaker 4>worker who's stepping into the market </v>
<v Speaker 4>for the first time or you know,</v>

1413
01:00:28.730 --> 01:00:33.420
<v Speaker 4>just hasn't been been able to acquire </v>
<v Speaker 4>job skills that would allow them to make</v>

1414
01:00:33.421 --> 01:00:37.830
<v Speaker 4>much more money per hour that they would</v>
<v Speaker 4>be taken advantage of by this</v>

1415
01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:43.360
<v Speaker 3>corporations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The corporations don't have all the </v>

1416
01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:43.360
<v Speaker 3>power because they're not the only </v>
<v Speaker 3>employer.</v>

1417
01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:47.981
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all employers compete with one another </v>

1418
01:00:47.981 --> 01:00:47.981
<v Speaker 3>for labor and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1419
01:00:47.981 --> 01:00:48.980
<v Speaker 3>and they bid up wages.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1420
01:00:48.981 --> 01:00:53.981
<v Speaker 3>you can't pay people less than the </v>
<v Speaker 3>market value of their labor because </v>

1421
01:00:53.981 --> 01:00:54.980
<v Speaker 3>somebody else will hire them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1422
01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:58.250
<v Speaker 3>so that you could talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1423
01:00:58.251 --> 01:01:01.640
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't it be great if everybody can </v>
<v Speaker 3>earn more money?</v>

1424
01:01:01.690 --> 01:01:06.690
<v Speaker 4>Has there ever been a proven example of </v>
<v Speaker 4>this where they've had no minimum wage </v>

1425
01:01:06.690 --> 01:01:07.840
<v Speaker 4>and it's been a financial boom?</v>

1426
01:01:08.050 --> 01:01:08.740
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

1427
01:01:08.741 --> 01:01:09.280
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

1428
01:01:09.281 --> 01:01:11.320
<v Speaker 3>we didn't always have a minimum wage in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the United States.</v>

1429
01:01:11.321 --> 01:01:11.590
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1430
01:01:11.650 --> 01:01:12.010
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1431
01:01:12.011 --> 01:01:17.011
<v Speaker 3>it happened really in the 19 thirties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you can look at situations of </v>

1432
01:01:17.011 --> 01:01:21.151
<v Speaker 3>countries that have no minimum wage and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they have very low levels of </v>

1433
01:01:21.151 --> 01:01:22.870
<v Speaker 3>unemployment and you can look at areas </v>
<v Speaker 3>where the government using this.</v>

1434
01:01:23.260 --> 01:01:23.800
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1435
01:01:23.830 --> 01:01:25.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't have a minimum wage in,</v>

1436
01:01:25.261 --> 01:01:26.320
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Singapore.</v>

1437
01:01:26.740 --> 01:01:27.730
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

1438
01:01:27.731 --> 01:01:28.770
<v Speaker 3>and there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are countries that,</v>

1439
01:01:28.771 --> 01:01:32.020
<v Speaker 3>since Singapore example though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an extremely wealthy country,</v>

1440
01:01:32.021 --> 01:01:32.340
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1441
01:01:32.350 --> 01:01:34.880
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the reasons they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1442
01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:40.040
<v Speaker 3>it's very easy to do business,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can look at examples where the </v>

1443
01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:42.970
<v Speaker 3>United States has imposed a minimum wage</v>
<v Speaker 3>on other countries.</v>

1444
01:01:42.971 --> 01:01:45.520
<v Speaker 3>I mean the minimum wages did a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>damage in Puerto Rico,</v>

1445
01:01:45.521 --> 01:01:50.521
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at another American territory of </v>

1446
01:01:50.521 --> 01:01:50.521
<v Speaker 3>American Samoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1447
01:01:50.521 --> 01:01:54.211
<v Speaker 3>American Samoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We basically destroyed American Samoa </v>

1448
01:01:54.211 --> 01:01:54.211
<v Speaker 3>with our minimum wage.</v>

1449
01:01:54.211 --> 01:01:54.920
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Samoans are,</v>

1450
01:01:54.940 --> 01:01:56.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are furious about it.</v>

1451
01:01:56.861 --> 01:01:59.260
<v Speaker 3>This happened years ago actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

1452
01:01:59.290 --> 01:02:04.290
<v Speaker 3>the reason I even found out about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was watching 60 minutes and they were </v>

1453
01:02:04.290 --> 01:02:06.370
<v Speaker 3>doing a report about I think football </v>
<v Speaker 3>players in Samoa.</v>

1454
01:02:07.110 --> 01:02:12.110
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and during their report they mentioned </v>

1455
01:02:12.110 --> 01:02:14.971
<v Speaker 3>that there was a depression going on in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Somalia and it was like there was 30 </v>

1456
01:02:14.971 --> 01:02:15.160
<v Speaker 3>percent unemployment and really high </v>
<v Speaker 3>inflation.</v>

1457
01:02:15.161 --> 01:02:16.750
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the hell is going on in Samoa?</v>

1458
01:02:17.050 --> 01:02:22.050
<v Speaker 3>So I wanted to research that on my own </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I out that we impose the minimum </v>

1459
01:02:22.050 --> 01:02:23.190
<v Speaker 3>wage on Samoa and we destroyed all their</v>
<v Speaker 3>jobs.</v>

1460
01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:28.340
<v Speaker 3>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the two biggest employers were to a </v>

1461
01:02:28.340 --> 01:02:29.160
<v Speaker 3>chicken of the sea and starkist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were canning tuna.</v>

1462
01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:31.470
<v Speaker 3>And then they were shipping the tune of </v>
<v Speaker 3>back to the mainland,</v>

1463
01:02:31.830 --> 01:02:33.690
<v Speaker 3>but the minute they raised the minimum </v>
<v Speaker 3>wage,</v>

1464
01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:35.790
<v Speaker 3>they made the production,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1465
01:02:35.810 --> 01:02:38.700
<v Speaker 3>uncompetitive because now you had to pay</v>
<v Speaker 3>the higher wages,</v>

1466
01:02:38.701 --> 01:02:41.100
<v Speaker 3>plus the shipping costs to get the tune </v>
<v Speaker 3>it back to the mainland.</v>

1467
01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:46.520
<v Speaker 3>So they all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the canneries shut down and then it </v>

1468
01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:48.270
<v Speaker 3>created massive unemployment and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>prices went way up on the island because</v>

1469
01:02:48.271 --> 01:02:51.210
<v Speaker 3>they no longer had boats coming back and</v>
<v Speaker 3>forth to pick up the tuna.</v>

1470
01:02:51.390 --> 01:02:54.150
<v Speaker 3>So now all of a sudden the shipping cost</v>
<v Speaker 3>of imports went way up.</v>

1471
01:02:54.151 --> 01:02:57.150
<v Speaker 3>So they had massive inflation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sky high unemployment,</v>

1472
01:02:57.270 --> 01:03:02.270
<v Speaker 3>all because the minimum wage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you could look at examples of how </v>

1473
01:03:02.270 --> 01:03:04.200
<v Speaker 3>minimum wage destroys jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1474
01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:05.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right there.</v>

1475
01:03:05.071 --> 01:03:09.300
<v Speaker 3>Yet they continued to advocate for these</v>
<v Speaker 3>higher wages because it sounds good.</v>

1476
01:03:09.330 --> 01:03:11.910
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody should earn a decent living.</v>

1477
01:03:12.030 --> 01:03:12.480
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1478
01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:15.510
<v Speaker 3>not if you don't have any skills,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't until of course,</v>

1479
01:03:15.511 --> 01:03:17.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of kids,</v>

1480
01:03:17.210 --> 01:03:18.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're 16,</v>

1481
01:03:18.211 --> 01:03:19.020
<v Speaker 3>17,</v>
<v Speaker 3>18,</v>

1482
01:03:19.021 --> 01:03:19.740
<v Speaker 3>19,</v>
<v Speaker 3>20.</v>

1483
01:03:19.741 --> 01:03:21.180
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people live with their parents.</v>

1484
01:03:21.181 --> 01:03:26.181
<v Speaker 3>Still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most important thing is getting a </v>

1485
01:03:26.181 --> 01:03:28.100
<v Speaker 3>job so you can acquire the skills to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>a better job to,</v>

1486
01:03:28.130 --> 01:03:30.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to move up the ladder in an organization</v>

1487
01:03:30.331 --> 01:03:32.130
<v Speaker 3>to enhance your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1488
01:03:32.131 --> 01:03:34.710
<v Speaker 3>your value to employers in general.</v>

1489
01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:39.090
<v Speaker 4>What's the argument against this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Against what you're saying about minimum</v>

1490
01:03:39.091 --> 01:03:42.170
<v Speaker 4>wage gangsta,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all these ideas that you're,</v>

1491
01:03:42.171 --> 01:03:44.700
<v Speaker 4>you're just proposing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you do get a lot of pushback?</v>

1492
01:03:44.790 --> 01:03:46.740
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure what you're saying,</v>

1493
01:03:46.741 --> 01:03:50.190
<v Speaker 4>this free market capitalism approach is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1494
01:03:50.191 --> 01:03:51.330
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of people that oppose it.</v>

1495
01:03:51.810 --> 01:03:56.810
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's a lot of people that </v>

1496
01:03:56.810 --> 01:03:58.521
<v Speaker 3>don't think it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They think with their mind or are there </v>

1497
01:03:58.521 --> 01:04:02.090
<v Speaker 3>others and they don't even get the read.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The origin of the minimum wage was </v>

1498
01:04:02.090 --> 01:04:03.780
<v Speaker 3>racism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the first minimum wages here,</v>

1499
01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:08.960
<v Speaker 3>it was designed to keep employers from </v>
<v Speaker 3>hiring the Chinese are from hiring </v>

1500
01:04:09.031 --> 01:04:12.300
<v Speaker 3>blacks because they know that that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>where the minimum wage came from,</v>

1501
01:04:12.540 --> 01:04:17.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to try to prevent employers from hiring </v>

1502
01:04:17.540 --> 01:04:17.540
<v Speaker 3>certain people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they said,</v>

1503
01:04:17.540 --> 01:04:20.811
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's have a minimum wage and that will </v>

1504
01:04:20.811 --> 01:04:20.811
<v Speaker 3>reduce our hiring of people who have </v>
<v Speaker 3>less skills.</v>

1505
01:04:20.811 --> 01:04:21.130
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1506
01:04:21.140 --> 01:04:22.650
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the labor unions,</v>

1507
01:04:22.651 --> 01:04:27.651
<v Speaker 3>the biggest supporters of the minimum </v>
<v Speaker 3>wage are the labor unions and none of </v>

1508
01:04:27.651 --> 01:04:30.480
<v Speaker 3>the labor unions workers earn the </v>
<v Speaker 3>minimum wage.</v>

1509
01:04:30.481 --> 01:04:31.830
<v Speaker 3>So you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why are they,</v>

1510
01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:36.860
<v Speaker 3>do they so care about the minimum wage </v>
<v Speaker 3>if they don't get paid a lot higher </v>

1511
01:04:36.860 --> 01:04:36.860
<v Speaker 3>than,</v>
<v Speaker 3>than wage?</v>

1512
01:04:36.860 --> 01:04:40.970
<v Speaker 3>And it's because you always have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>competition between skilled labor and </v>

1513
01:04:40.970 --> 01:04:41.550
<v Speaker 3>unskilled labor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1514
01:04:41.551 --> 01:04:45.630
<v Speaker 3>So let's say a business,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a businessman has the option of hiring a</v>

1515
01:04:45.631 --> 01:04:50.631
<v Speaker 3>skilled person to do something and let's</v>
<v Speaker 3>say the skilled person is going to </v>

1516
01:04:50.631 --> 01:04:54.711
<v Speaker 3>charge $20 an hour or an unskilled </v>
<v Speaker 3>person and let's say I can hire three </v>

1517
01:04:55.681 --> 01:04:59.520
<v Speaker 3>unskilled people for $5 an hour and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>equals 15.</v>

1518
01:04:59.670 --> 01:05:00.300
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1519
01:05:00.301 --> 01:05:02.730
<v Speaker 3>I'd rather hire the unskilled worker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can pay three,</v>

1520
01:05:02.731 --> 01:05:05.880
<v Speaker 3>$5 an hour to do the same job of one </v>
<v Speaker 3>skilled worker.</v>

1521
01:05:06.150 --> 01:05:10.200
<v Speaker 3>But now if the skilled worker can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could lobby for $7 minimum wage,</v>

1522
01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:12.450
<v Speaker 3>now if I have to hire three unskilled </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

1523
01:05:12.451 --> 01:05:14.310
<v Speaker 3>it costs $21.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Aha.</v>

1524
01:05:14.490 --> 01:05:16.590
<v Speaker 3>Now all of a sudden I hire the guy with </v>
<v Speaker 3>skills.</v>

1525
01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:21.960
<v Speaker 3>So the labor unions benefit by keeping </v>
<v Speaker 3>unskilled people unemployed because they</v>

1526
01:05:22.841 --> 01:05:25.630
<v Speaker 3>have more skills and therefore they can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1527
01:05:25.631 --> 01:05:30.631
<v Speaker 3>they can get more work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That sounds like a complicated mess to </v>

1528
01:05:30.631 --> 01:05:31.300
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is a mess for the,</v>

1529
01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:36.480
<v Speaker 3>for the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the people that get get priced out </v>

1530
01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:36.480
<v Speaker 3>of a job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1531
01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:37.400
<v Speaker 4>Now Democratic Socialism is the thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>right now.</v>

1532
01:05:37.430 --> 01:05:39.050
<v Speaker 4>This is the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're hearing it all the time.</v>

1533
01:05:39.051 --> 01:05:40.310
<v Speaker 4>You're hearing it constantly in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>news.</v>

1534
01:05:40.510 --> 01:05:41.810
<v Speaker 4>What do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you attribute that?</v>

1535
01:05:42.050 --> 01:05:46.700
<v Speaker 4>Do you think it's a frustration with </v>
<v Speaker 4>this lifelong politicians?</v>

1536
01:05:46.890 --> 01:05:50.750
<v Speaker 4>Like what do you think it is that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>causing this upper eyes and upswing?</v>

1537
01:05:50.900 --> 01:05:52.010
<v Speaker 4>The woman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is her name?</v>

1538
01:05:52.011 --> 01:05:53.390
<v Speaker 4>That one in New York?</v>

1539
01:05:53.830 --> 01:05:54.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1540
01:05:54.311 --> 01:05:56.800
<v Speaker 3>she's actually half Puerto Rican.</v>

<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

1542
01:05:58.601 --> 01:06:01.170
<v Speaker 3>I forget her name and country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Puerto Rico.</v>

1543
01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:02.140
<v Speaker 3>United States.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1544
01:06:02.141 --> 01:06:02.950
<v Speaker 3>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1545
01:06:02.990 --> 01:06:05.410
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I found this out as I'm traveling now.</v>

1546
01:06:05.450 --> 01:06:07.270
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still have an American passport,</v>

1547
01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:12.720
<v Speaker 3>but when I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I mentioned what country I'm from </v>

1548
01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:13.330
<v Speaker 3>and where you live,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always have to select Puerto Rico as a</v>

1549
01:06:13.331 --> 01:06:15.310
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even though it's part of America,</v>

1550
01:06:15.590 --> 01:06:20.590
<v Speaker 3>it's still considered its own country </v>
<v Speaker 3>even though you still are American </v>

1551
01:06:20.590 --> 01:06:21.970
<v Speaker 3>citizens when you live there and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>travel on a,</v>

1552
01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:26.180
<v Speaker 3>on a US passport,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's listed as a separate country from,</v>

1553
01:06:26.181 --> 01:06:31.181
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the battle to the reader name from </v>

1554
01:06:31.181 --> 01:06:31.181
<v Speaker 3>a twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alexandria.</v>

1555
01:06:31.181 --> 01:06:31.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1556
01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:33.220
<v Speaker 3>Cortez,</v>
<v Speaker 3>28 years old.</v>

1557
01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:34.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well she beat,</v>

1558
01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:38.530
<v Speaker 3>she beat a 10 term incumbent comment and</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course he was a white guy.</v>

1559
01:06:38.531 --> 01:06:40.030
<v Speaker 3>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a negative for him,</v>

1560
01:06:40.330 --> 01:06:42.370
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a woman of color.</v>

1561
01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:43.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1562
01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.690
<v Speaker 3>Latina woman to actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1563
01:06:45.950 --> 01:06:46.660
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1564
01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:47.230
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1565
01:06:47.290 --> 01:06:52.290
<v Speaker 3>but the thing is people I think in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>community are just voting at a </v>

1566
01:06:52.290 --> 01:06:52.540
<v Speaker 3>frustration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

1567
01:06:52.541 --> 01:06:54.640
<v Speaker 3>I looked at her commercial,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1568
01:06:54.641 --> 01:06:56.530
<v Speaker 3>and it's a very powerful commercial,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1569
01:06:56.531 --> 01:06:57.880
<v Speaker 3>Kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know about,</v>

1570
01:06:57.881 --> 01:07:02.881
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>women like me are not supposed to run </v>

1571
01:07:02.881 --> 01:07:05.851
<v Speaker 3>for office.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not supposed to have court when </v>

1572
01:07:05.851 --> 01:07:08.290
<v Speaker 3>this whole bunch of nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's a story that I think resonated </v>

1573
01:07:08.290 --> 01:07:08.290
<v Speaker 3>with a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1574
01:07:08.290 --> 01:07:09.490
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's stick it to the man.</v>

1575
01:07:09.660 --> 01:07:10.590
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1576
01:07:10.810 --> 01:07:12.430
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's what they did.</v>

1577
01:07:12.790 --> 01:07:17.790
<v Speaker 3>But I think that this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this wave is going to be bigger than </v>

1578
01:07:17.790 --> 01:07:19.300
<v Speaker 3>people think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think people are underestimating.</v>

1579
01:07:19.301 --> 01:07:19.750
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1580
01:07:19.751 --> 01:07:21.430
<v Speaker 3>this is unique because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1581
01:07:21.730 --> 01:07:22.540
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1582
01:07:22.630 --> 01:07:23.520
<v Speaker 3>she's in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1583
01:07:23.530 --> 01:07:27.580
<v Speaker 3>a heavily minority community.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that message work better.</v>

1584
01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:29.550
<v Speaker 3>But look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bernie Sanders</v>

1585
01:07:29.770 --> 01:07:31.290
<v Speaker 4>read this here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jamie just pulled up.</v>

1586
01:07:31.650 --> 01:07:34.140
<v Speaker 4>She won in a district where she didn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>even run.</v>

1587
01:07:34.430 --> 01:07:35.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Progressive candidate</v>

1588
01:07:35.700 --> 01:07:39.300
<v Speaker 4>also won a primary and our neighboring </v>
<v Speaker 4>district in the bronx</v>

1589
01:07:39.620 --> 01:07:42.080
<v Speaker 3>as a write in for the reform party.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1590
01:07:42.081 --> 01:07:43.370
<v Speaker 3>well that's alright.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But she won.</v>

1591
01:07:43.550 --> 01:07:44.980
<v Speaker 3>She won.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1592
01:07:45.990 --> 01:07:46.670
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1593
01:07:47.110 --> 01:07:49.790
<v Speaker 3>you think you could have two house seats</v>
<v Speaker 3>simultaneously,</v>

1594
01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:50.730
<v Speaker 3>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>

1595
01:07:51.320 --> 01:07:56.320
<v Speaker 3>But the eyesight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you look at Bernie Sanders </v>

1596
01:07:56.320 --> 01:07:57.020
<v Speaker 3>appeal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't just,</v>

1597
01:07:57.021 --> 01:07:57.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1598
01:07:57.930 --> 01:08:02.930

<v Speaker 3>that were attracted to the sanders </v>

1599
01:08:02.930 --> 01:08:07.811
<v Speaker 3>message.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what was that message that was </v>

1600
01:08:07.811 --> 01:08:07.811
<v Speaker 3>attractive?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

1601
01:08:07.811 --> 01:08:07.811
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1603
01:08:07.811 --> 01:08:08.150
<v Speaker 3>giving ratios.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we got,</v>

1604
01:08:08.151 --> 01:08:13.151
<v Speaker 3>we got to tax the rich,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we got a tax fusion of wealth and it's </v>

1605
01:08:13.151 --> 01:08:14.360
<v Speaker 3>all about getting stuff for free,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1606
01:08:14.361 --> 01:08:15.770
<v Speaker 3>It's all about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want,</v>

1610
01:08:21.300 --> 01:08:23.980
<v Speaker 3>they want the government to guarantee </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody at chomp.</v>

1611
01:08:24.060 --> 01:08:29.060
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was one of the things that Bernie </v>

1612
01:08:29.060 --> 01:08:29.060
<v Speaker 3>said that he could guarantee people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>

1613
01:08:29.060 --> 01:08:29.060
<v Speaker 3>you can't hear in the country.</v>

1614
01:08:29.220 --> 01:08:30.670
<v Speaker 3>How's the governor getting guaranteed </v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1615
01:08:30.690 --> 01:08:31.880
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where's the government saying,</v>

1616
01:08:31.910 --> 01:08:32.870
<v Speaker 3>where's the governor going to get the </v>
<v Speaker 3>money?</v>

1617
01:08:32.871 --> 01:08:34.640
<v Speaker 3>They did that in the Soviet Union.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1618
01:08:34.641 --> 01:08:36.890
<v Speaker 3>everybody has a job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but nobody makes anything.</v>

1619
01:08:36.891 --> 01:08:38.600
<v Speaker 3>And so everybody is poor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1620
01:08:38.601 --> 01:08:43.601
<v Speaker 3>you can't say what they want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>guarantee a $15 an hour job plus </v>

1621
01:08:43.601 --> 01:08:46.250
<v Speaker 3>benefits plus vacation plus health care </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do what?</v>

1622
01:08:46.460 --> 01:08:47.450
<v Speaker 3>And of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the governor?</v>

1623
01:08:47.451 --> 01:08:49.490
<v Speaker 3>The governor's going to assign jobs to </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody.</v>

1624
01:08:49.491 --> 01:08:51.140
<v Speaker 3>What are they all going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1625
01:08:51.141 --> 01:08:56.141
<v Speaker 3>people forget that we don't want jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We want the productivity that result </v>

1626
01:08:56.661 --> 01:08:59.090
<v Speaker 3>from the job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's about productive employment,</v>

1627
01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:00.770
<v Speaker 3>not make work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1628
01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:03.110
<v Speaker 3>We don't want it to government digging </v>
<v Speaker 3>holes and filling them.</v>

1629
01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:04.530
<v Speaker 3>We want real jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1630
01:09:04.531 --> 01:09:09.531
<v Speaker 3>and how do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how does the private sector know what </v>

1631
01:09:09.531 --> 01:09:10.160
<v Speaker 3>jobs are needed?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's demand.</v>

1632
01:09:10.161 --> 01:09:13.190
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's individuals that want something,</v>

1633
01:09:13.191 --> 01:09:14.930
<v Speaker 3>they're guided by a profit motive.</v>

1634
01:09:15.230 --> 01:09:20.230
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the government that have governed </v>

1635
01:09:20.230 --> 01:09:21.571
<v Speaker 3>doesn't make a profit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing to guide them to </v>

1636
01:09:21.571 --> 01:09:24.221
<v Speaker 3>efficiently allocate resources and how's</v>
<v Speaker 3>the government going to just figure out </v>

1637
01:09:24.221 --> 01:09:25.820
<v Speaker 3>what people should do and just assign </v>
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>

1638
01:09:25.910 --> 01:09:27.410
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the job you're going to do.</v>

1639
01:09:27.411 --> 01:09:28.160
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1640
01:09:28.161 --> 01:09:30.940
<v Speaker 3>it would destroy employment in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>country if,</v>

1641
01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:33.530
<v Speaker 3>if you did that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which this doesn't even make sense,</v>

1642
01:09:33.531 --> 01:09:38.531
<v Speaker 3>that you could offer everyone a job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you don't have those jobs first of </v>

1643
01:09:38.531 --> 01:09:39.350
<v Speaker 3>all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the idea that,</v>

1644
01:09:39.351 --> 01:09:40.700
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are we going to do?</v>

1645
01:09:40.701 --> 01:09:45.701
<v Speaker 3>We're going to create x amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>construction jobs and x amount of </v>

1646
01:09:45.701 --> 01:09:46.400
<v Speaker 3>dishwashing jobs and x amount of carwash</v>
<v Speaker 3>jobs.</v>

1647
01:09:46.401 --> 01:09:48.710
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and where's the money gonna come from to</v>

1648
01:09:48.711 --> 01:09:49.660
<v Speaker 3>pay for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to,</v>

1649
01:09:49.700 --> 01:09:54.700
<v Speaker 3>they're going to have to take the money </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the private sector that would have </v>

1650
01:09:54.700 --> 01:09:57.821
<v Speaker 3>created efficient jobs and they're going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to give it to the government to create </v>

1651
01:09:57.821 --> 01:09:57.821
<v Speaker 3>inefficient jobs.</v>

1652
01:09:57.821 --> 01:09:58.860
<v Speaker 3>It's a disaster,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the the,</v>

1653
01:09:58.940 --> 01:10:03.940
<v Speaker 3>the problem that I mentioned earlier is </v>
<v Speaker 3>the economy is in bad shape because of </v>

1654
01:10:04.011 --> 01:10:09.011
<v Speaker 3>all the government.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what go went back to the occupy </v>

1655
01:10:09.011 --> 01:10:12.251
<v Speaker 3>Wall Street is that the people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>protesting because there are serious </v>

1656
01:10:12.251 --> 01:10:17.170
<v Speaker 3>problems in the country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't realize that it's not </v>

1657
01:10:17.170 --> 01:10:17.720
<v Speaker 3>capitalism that is creating those </v>
<v Speaker 3>problems.</v>

1658
01:10:17.721 --> 01:10:22.721
<v Speaker 3>Capitalism would solve those problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's government interference that is </v>

1659
01:10:22.721 --> 01:10:26.831
<v Speaker 3>causing the problems that they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>protesting and so the same thing with </v>

1660
01:10:26.831 --> 01:10:26.990
<v Speaker 3>the socialists that they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1661
01:10:26.991 --> 01:10:29.480
<v Speaker 3>they understand that their standard of </v>
<v Speaker 3>living is falling,</v>

1662
01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:34.760
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at one of the things they want to </v>

1663
01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:34.760
<v Speaker 3>do is they want to give free education,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1664
01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:38.921
<v Speaker 3>Because the liberals are all complaining</v>
<v Speaker 3>about the fact that college is so </v>

1665
01:10:38.921 --> 01:10:39.800
<v Speaker 3>expensive and that students have so much</v>
<v Speaker 3>debt.</v>

1666
01:10:40.370 --> 01:10:42.740
<v Speaker 3>That's because the government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>before the government got involved,</v>

1667
01:10:42.741 --> 01:10:47.741
<v Speaker 3>college was cheap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean government drove up the cost of </v>

1668
01:10:47.741 --> 01:10:50.270
<v Speaker 3>college by guaranteeing student loans.</v>

1669
01:10:50.270 --> 01:10:53.120
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's how the government got the</v>
<v Speaker 3>votes of students.</v>

1670
01:10:53.121 --> 01:10:55.070
<v Speaker 3>They promised the students something for</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>

1671
01:10:55.071 --> 01:10:55.430
<v Speaker 3>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1672
01:10:55.431 --> 01:11:00.230
<v Speaker 3>vote for me and I'll guarantee I'll make</v>
<v Speaker 3>it easier for you to get a loan to go to</v>

1673
01:11:00.231 --> 01:11:01.040
<v Speaker 3>college.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1674
01:11:01.041 --> 01:11:06.041
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the minute colleges knew that people </v>

1675
01:11:06.041 --> 01:11:09.161
<v Speaker 3>could get these loans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They started jacking up the tuition so </v>

1676
01:11:09.161 --> 01:11:09.590
<v Speaker 3>they could benefit from all this </v>
<v Speaker 3>government money,</v>

1677
01:11:09.770 --> 01:11:14.770
<v Speaker 3>so the college has benefited.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The banking system benefited by making </v>

1678
01:11:14.770 --> 01:11:16.440
<v Speaker 3>riskless loans at the taxpayer was on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the hook for,</v>

1679
01:11:16.770 --> 01:11:21.770
<v Speaker 3>but the byproduct of all this cheap </v>
<v Speaker 3>money being funneled that the colleges </v>

1680
01:11:21.770 --> 01:11:23.640
<v Speaker 3>was that the colleges kept raising the </v>
<v Speaker 3>tuition higher and higher and higher,</v>

1681
01:11:23.790 --> 01:11:28.790
<v Speaker 3>and then the politicians kept increasing</v>
<v Speaker 3>the amount of loans they would </v>

1682
01:11:28.790 --> 01:11:31.941
<v Speaker 3>subsidize,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so all of this is the fault of </v>

1683
01:11:31.941 --> 01:11:34.851
<v Speaker 3>government.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The government created the problem that </v>

1684
01:11:34.851 --> 01:11:34.851
<v Speaker 3>they're not complaining about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you,</v>

1685
01:11:34.851 --> 01:11:35.130
<v Speaker 3>the students don't understand that.</v>

1686
01:11:35.130 --> 01:11:38.040
<v Speaker 3>That's why college is so expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1687
01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:43.100
<v Speaker 3>no one sees a clear way out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's part of the problem and that's </v>

1688
01:11:43.100 --> 01:11:44.430
<v Speaker 3>one of the reasons why socialism is so </v>
<v Speaker 3>compelling.</v>

1689
01:11:44.730 --> 01:11:49.730
<v Speaker 3>It's like this seems like it's an </v>
<v Speaker 3>alternative to what we're currently </v>

1690
01:11:49.730 --> 01:11:50.280
<v Speaker 3>experiencing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So people look at that and go,</v>

1691
01:11:50.281 --> 01:11:51.890
<v Speaker 3>maybe that's the solution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I look.</v>

1692
01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:56.900
<v Speaker 3>People want something different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said that's why trump was able to </v>

1693
01:11:56.900 --> 01:12:00.411
<v Speaker 3>claim that he was going to shake things </v>
<v Speaker 3>up and make America great again because </v>

1694
01:12:00.411 --> 01:12:02.460
<v Speaker 3>I'm different because what's working,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we have now is not working.</v>

1695
01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:07.410
<v Speaker 3>That's why I'm so afraid that when </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who voted for trump,</v>

1696
01:12:07.950 --> 01:12:12.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>end up being disillusioned because </v>

1697
01:12:12.950 --> 01:12:12.950
<v Speaker 3>nothing changes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their lives don't get better,</v>

1698
01:12:12.950 --> 01:12:17.540
<v Speaker 3>and you're completely convinced that </v>
<v Speaker 3>this is going to be a crash coming in </v>

1699
01:12:17.540 --> 01:12:17.540
<v Speaker 3>the next three years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1700
01:12:17.540 --> 01:12:17.540
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1701
01:12:17.540 --> 01:12:18.990
<v Speaker 3>there's going to be a big recession,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1702
01:12:18.990 --> 01:12:21.810
<v Speaker 3>I think it's going to be worse than the </v>
<v Speaker 3>2008 financial crisis.</v>

1703
01:12:21.811 --> 01:12:25.740
<v Speaker 3>I mean that because the government was </v>
<v Speaker 3>able to bail everybody out that time,</v>

1704
01:12:25.741 --> 01:12:30.741
<v Speaker 3>they were able to print a bunch of money</v>
<v Speaker 3>and go deeper into debt and the </v>

1705
01:12:30.741 --> 01:12:34.041
<v Speaker 3>financial crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you didn't have money in the stock </v>

1706
01:12:34.041 --> 01:12:34.140
<v Speaker 3>market and you didn't lose your job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't that bad,</v>

1707
01:12:34.170 --> 01:12:34.650
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1708
01:12:34.830 --> 01:12:36.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know you were fine,</v>

1709
01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:40.860
<v Speaker 3>but this next crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if you don't lose your job,</v>

1710
01:12:41.010 --> 01:12:42.780
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be affected by </v>
<v Speaker 3>inflation.</v>

1711
01:12:42.990 --> 01:12:47.990
<v Speaker 3>Prices are gonna go way up because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think this is going to be a dollar </v>

1712
01:12:47.990 --> 01:12:50.751
<v Speaker 3>crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is going to be a sovereign debt </v>

1713
01:12:50.751 --> 01:12:52.761
<v Speaker 3>crisis and investors were bailed out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The government was able to bail out </v>

1714
01:12:52.761 --> 01:12:56.190
<v Speaker 3>investors last time with quantitative </v>
<v Speaker 3>easing and all tarp and all that,</v>

1715
01:12:56.580 --> 01:12:59.370
<v Speaker 3>but the next time investors are not </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to get bailed out,</v>

1716
01:12:59.400 --> 01:12:59.610
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1717
01:12:59.610 --> 01:13:04.610
<v Speaker 3>They're going to go down for the count </v>
<v Speaker 3>because if they try and I believe they </v>

1718
01:13:04.610 --> 01:13:08.241
<v Speaker 3>will try to reflate the bubbles again by</v>
<v Speaker 3>printing even more money doing another </v>

1719
01:13:08.241 --> 01:13:12.741
<v Speaker 3>round of quantitative easing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to destroy the dollar so </v>

1720
01:13:12.741 --> 01:13:14.580
<v Speaker 3>they're not going to reflate the bubble </v>
<v Speaker 3>in stocks.</v>

1721
01:13:14.581 --> 01:13:19.581
<v Speaker 3>They're going to prick the bubble in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>dollar and so when the dollar loses </v>

1722
01:13:19.581 --> 01:13:21.510
<v Speaker 3>value and prices go up and you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>stagflation,</v>

1723
01:13:21.900 --> 01:13:23.630
<v Speaker 3>you have a combination of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a,</v>

1724
01:13:23.660 --> 01:13:26.130
<v Speaker 3>of a recession and inflation at the same</v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

1725
01:13:26.310 --> 01:13:31.310
<v Speaker 3>and then of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is the Fed going to do in that </v>

1726
01:13:31.310 --> 01:13:31.970
<v Speaker 3>circumstance because they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1727
01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:35.730
<v Speaker 3>their playbook is if you have recession,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you ease.</v>

1728
01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:37.770
<v Speaker 3>If you have inflation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you tighten.</v>

1729
01:13:38.220 --> 01:13:39.720
<v Speaker 3>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What if you have them both together?</v>

1730
01:13:39.810 --> 01:13:41.640
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just did these stress tests,</v>

1731
01:13:41.730 --> 01:13:46.730
<v Speaker 3>you're here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these bank stress tests and the Federal </v>

1732
01:13:46.730 --> 01:13:48.030
<v Speaker 3>Reserve came out and they said that all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the banks passed.</v>

1733
01:13:48.060 --> 01:13:49.200
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What a shocker,</v>

1734
01:13:49.201 --> 01:13:54.201
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Fed came up with a test that </v>

1735
01:13:54.201 --> 01:13:55.260
<v Speaker 3>everybody passed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you look at the assumptions that,</v>

1736
01:13:55.420 --> 01:14:00.420
<v Speaker 3>that they made about the economy under </v>
<v Speaker 3>the worst case scenario that they </v>

1737
01:14:00.420 --> 01:14:05.091
<v Speaker 3>assumed interest rates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tenure rates go no higher than three </v>

1738
01:14:05.091 --> 01:14:05.460
<v Speaker 3>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't go.</v>

1739
01:14:05.490 --> 01:14:06.420
<v Speaker 3>They don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't go down,</v>

1740
01:14:06.421 --> 01:14:11.421
<v Speaker 3>they just don't go up and they assume </v>
<v Speaker 3>that inflation stays below two percent </v>

1741
01:14:11.421 --> 01:14:15.560
<v Speaker 3>under the case scenario,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they assume that the Fed is able to </v>

1742
01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:16.120
<v Speaker 3>lower interest rates to one percent to </v>
<v Speaker 3>zero.</v>

1743
01:14:16.121 --> 01:14:18.220
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to stimulate the economy.</v>

1744
01:14:18.430 --> 01:14:19.010
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1745
01:14:19.270 --> 01:14:21.610
<v Speaker 3>what happens if inflation doesn't go </v>
<v Speaker 3>down?</v>

1746
01:14:21.611 --> 01:14:23.530
<v Speaker 3>What if it goes up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if it goes up to five percent,</v>

1747
01:14:23.710 --> 01:14:25.390
<v Speaker 3>eight percent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

1748
01:14:25.391 --> 01:14:28.090
<v Speaker 3>If interest rates go up to five percent </v>
<v Speaker 3>or eight percent,</v>

1749
01:14:28.091 --> 01:14:29.860
<v Speaker 3>10 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happens then?</v>

1750
01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:35.160
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the banks collapsed because what </v>

1751
01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:36.540
<v Speaker 3>happens if we have a recession where the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fed can't stimulate because inflate,</v>

1752
01:14:36.580 --> 01:14:41.580
<v Speaker 3>they have to fight inflation or what </v>
<v Speaker 3>happens if we have a recession and the </v>

1753
01:14:41.580 --> 01:14:45.151
<v Speaker 3>government has to raise taxes during the</v>
<v Speaker 3>recession because the budget deficit is </v>

1754
01:14:45.151 --> 01:14:47.260
<v Speaker 3>exploding and they don't have the money </v>
<v Speaker 3>to pay the interest on the debt.</v>

1755
01:14:47.650 --> 01:14:48.970
<v Speaker 3>What does happen?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1756
01:14:49.110 --> 01:14:49.520
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1757
01:14:49.521 --> 01:14:54.521
<v Speaker 3>I think that the political politics are </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to play come into play and that </v>

1758
01:14:56.231 --> 01:14:59.680
<v Speaker 3>the Fed is going to air on allowing </v>
<v Speaker 3>inflation to run out of control.</v>

1759
01:15:00.010 --> 01:15:03.360
<v Speaker 3>They're going to do what they can to try</v>
<v Speaker 3>to prop up the economy and they're going</v>

1760
01:15:03.361 --> 01:15:05.530
<v Speaker 3>to sacrifice the dollar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to say,</v>

1761
01:15:05.531 --> 01:15:10.531
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>inflation is the lesser of the two </v>

1762
01:15:10.531 --> 01:15:10.531
<v Speaker 3>evils,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's actually gonna end up being the</v>

1763
01:15:10.531 --> 01:15:11.740
<v Speaker 3>greater evil and member,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1764
01:15:12.070 --> 01:15:14.260
<v Speaker 3>when Nixon imposed wage and price </v>
<v Speaker 3>controls,</v>

1765
01:15:14.261 --> 01:15:17.200
<v Speaker 3>which was a very misguided effort.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's Kinda like,</v>

1766
01:15:17.201 --> 01:15:19.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what trump is doing with the,</v>

1767
01:15:19.001 --> 01:15:21.070
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with terrorists trying to cure the trade</v>

1768
01:15:21.071 --> 01:15:26.071
<v Speaker 3>deficit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rising prices are the result of </v>

1769
01:15:26.071 --> 01:15:26.071
<v Speaker 3>inflation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not the cause.</v>

1770
01:15:26.071 --> 01:15:30.391
<v Speaker 3>And so price controls don't work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They simply try to mask the problem </v>

1771
01:15:30.391 --> 01:15:34.740
<v Speaker 3>while it while it a while it gets worse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think they're going to let </v>

1772
01:15:34.740 --> 01:15:35.080
<v Speaker 3>inflation get a lot worse.</v>

1773
01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:39.700
<v Speaker 3>And what that's gonna mean is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1774
01:15:40.300 --> 01:15:41.980
<v Speaker 3>people need to prepare for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1775
01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:47.320
<v Speaker 3>people need to do something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We talked about that when I was on your </v>

1776
01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:47.320
<v Speaker 3>show before about buying gold,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1777
01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:48.610
<v Speaker 3>we talked about cryptocurrencies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I talked about,</v>

1778
01:15:48.611 --> 01:15:50.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gold money and by the way,</v>

1779
01:15:50.381 --> 01:15:55.381
<v Speaker 3>this is when we talked about gold money </v>
<v Speaker 3>on your show before and so many people,</v>

1780
01:15:56.350 --> 01:15:59.110
<v Speaker 3>this just shows you how many people </v>
<v Speaker 3>listen to this podcast.</v>

1781
01:15:59.470 --> 01:16:04.470
<v Speaker 3>So many people tried to open up accounts</v>
<v Speaker 3>at gold money because of our </v>

1782
01:16:04.470 --> 01:16:06.160
<v Speaker 3>conversation that the regulators </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually shut them down.</v>

1783
01:16:06.161 --> 01:16:11.161
<v Speaker 3>They actually stopped them from </v>
<v Speaker 3>onboarding new customers because there </v>

1784
01:16:11.161 --> 01:16:12.310
<v Speaker 3>was too many people coming onto the </v>
<v Speaker 3>platform and,</v>

1785
01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:13.810
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1786
01:16:13.811 --> 01:16:15.930
<v Speaker 3>and the reason that this is the bay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is this,</v>

1787
01:16:15.931 --> 01:16:17.110
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the system that we're in now.</v>

1788
01:16:17.111 --> 01:16:19.240
<v Speaker 3>Because when you have a gold money </v>
<v Speaker 3>account,</v>

1789
01:16:19.241 --> 01:16:19.420
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1790
01:16:19.420 --> 01:16:24.420
<v Speaker 3>It's not like just buying gold,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have gold that you can actually </v>

1791
01:16:24.420 --> 01:16:29.340
<v Speaker 3>transact in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can take my golden and I can send it </v>

1792
01:16:29.340 --> 01:16:30.340
<v Speaker 3>to anybody I want anywhere in the world </v>
<v Speaker 3>who has an account for free,</v>

1793
01:16:30.550 --> 01:16:33.700
<v Speaker 3>so it's like a money transfer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So gold has to be actually stored.</v>

1794
01:16:34.620 --> 01:16:36.670
<v Speaker 3>Some real golden it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1795
01:16:36.671 --> 01:16:39.100
<v Speaker 3>There's gold stored in a brink's vault </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

1796
01:16:39.101 --> 01:16:44.101
<v Speaker 3>they have vaults all around the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I can transfer my ownership of that </v>

1797
01:16:44.101 --> 01:16:48.391
<v Speaker 3>goal to you or anybody else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but because I can do that now all of a </v>

1798
01:16:48.391 --> 01:16:50.110
<v Speaker 3>sudden the regulations there because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're worried about terrorists,</v>

1799
01:16:50.111 --> 01:16:53.470
<v Speaker 3>they're worried about money laundering </v>
<v Speaker 3>and so everybody who has an account,</v>

1800
01:16:53.650 --> 01:16:56.650
<v Speaker 3>there has to be a lot of scrutiny about </v>
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>

1801
01:16:56.710 --> 01:16:59.680
<v Speaker 3>those accounts and those transactions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just like it was a bank.</v>

1802
01:17:00.070 --> 01:17:02.860
<v Speaker 3>And so this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this and a lot of people got frustrated.</v>

1803
01:17:02.861 --> 01:17:04.630
<v Speaker 3>I got a lot of emails from people who </v>
<v Speaker 3>were frustrated.</v>

1804
01:17:04.631 --> 01:17:09.631
<v Speaker 3>They try to open up an account and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't realize that it was the </v>

1805
01:17:09.631 --> 01:17:09.631
<v Speaker 3>regulators,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1806
01:17:09.631 --> 01:17:10.010
<v Speaker 3>they get mad at gold money because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're</v>

1807
01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:12.200
<v Speaker 2>not opening up their account or </v>
<v Speaker 2>improving their account,</v>

1808
01:17:12.470 --> 01:17:16.400
<v Speaker 2>but it's the regulations that are the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cog in the machine.</v>

1809
01:17:16.580 --> 01:17:18.180
<v Speaker 2>But the good news is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they've,</v>

1810
01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:23.240
<v Speaker 2>they've made,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've satisfied the regulators </v>

1811
01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:23.240
<v Speaker 2>recently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've come up with some new systems,</v>

1812
01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:27.751
<v Speaker 2>so the process is a lot more efficient </v>
<v Speaker 2>now for people to go online and buy gold</v>

1813
01:17:28.131 --> 01:17:30.140
<v Speaker 2>and you don't get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can buy know 25,</v>

1814
01:17:30.141 --> 01:17:35.141
<v Speaker 2>50 bucks worth 100 bucks worth of gold </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you actually have another store of </v>

1815
01:17:35.351 --> 01:17:40.351
<v Speaker 2>value,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another means of transacting with other </v>

1816
01:17:40.351 --> 01:17:42.440
<v Speaker 2>people where you can have some </v>
<v Speaker 2>protection against,</v>

1817
01:17:42.441 --> 01:17:43.700
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>against inflation.</v>

1818
01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:44.990
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I showed you,</v>

1819
01:17:44.991 --> 01:17:45.770
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

1820
01:17:45.771 --> 01:17:47.180
<v Speaker 2>they're sending you one of those gold </v>
<v Speaker 2>carts.</v>

1821
01:17:47.181 --> 01:17:49.150
<v Speaker 2>I talked to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1822
01:17:49.290 --> 01:17:50.990
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I showed you this car that I have to do,</v>

1823
01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:52.880
<v Speaker 2>have to send them some money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're going to have to get,</v>

1824
01:17:52.940 --> 01:17:54.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure if they're going to preload</v>
<v Speaker 2>your account,</v>

1825
01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:56.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went through,</v>

1826
01:17:56.001 --> 01:17:57.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I brought this card through the,</v>

1827
01:17:57.830 --> 01:17:58.850
<v Speaker 2>through the security today.</v>

1828
01:17:58.870 --> 01:18:02.750
<v Speaker 2>And of course every time I go through </v>
<v Speaker 2>security with discard it rings.</v>

1829
01:18:02.900 --> 01:18:05.240
<v Speaker 2>So I always have to take my wallet out </v>
<v Speaker 2>and put it in a,</v>

1830
01:18:05.260 --> 01:18:07.220
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a little the little bin.</v>

1831
01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:08.550
<v Speaker 2>And it freaked out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1832
01:18:08.570 --> 01:18:11.120
<v Speaker 2>they can never figure out what's going </v>
<v Speaker 2>on because Satan and they see this thing</v>

1833
01:18:11.121 --> 01:18:12.380
<v Speaker 2>a metal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have no idea what it is.</v>

1834
01:18:12.381 --> 01:18:13.400
<v Speaker 2>So it's always like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1835
01:18:13.820 --> 01:18:16.030
<v Speaker 2>it stops me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's a conversation piece.</v>

1836
01:18:16.031 --> 01:18:19.100
<v Speaker 2>But I had about three or four different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A Tsa guys were all like,</v>

1837
01:18:19.130 --> 01:18:21.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at this card is that gold places</v>

1838
01:18:21.290 --> 01:18:22.580
<v Speaker 2>we'll go though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is pure gold.</v>

1839
01:18:22.610 --> 01:18:23.360
<v Speaker 2>It's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is.</v>

1840
01:18:23.361 --> 01:18:23.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

1841
01:18:23.990 --> 01:18:27.890
<v Speaker 2>this is a 24 karat gold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So is gold mixed with metal,</v>

1842
01:18:27.891 --> 01:18:28.940
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mixed with steel.</v>

1843
01:18:28.970 --> 01:18:31.490
<v Speaker 2>It's not mixed with anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's 24 karat gold,</v>

1844
01:18:31.500 --> 01:18:36.500
<v Speaker 2>like gold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also mixed with something else as </v>

1845
01:18:36.500 --> 01:18:36.500
<v Speaker 2>pure gold.</v>

1846
01:18:36.500 --> 01:18:36.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1847
01:18:36.500 --> 01:18:37.610
<v Speaker 2>that's like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you go buy gold jewelry,</v>

1848
01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:42.640
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're getting an 18 carat gold or 14 </v>

1849
01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:42.640
<v Speaker 2>karat gold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how much does this card worth?</v>

1850
01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:43.940
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of like 14,</v>
<v Speaker 2>1400 bucks.</v>

1851
01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.560
<v Speaker 2>This would be an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Melted down.</v>

1852
01:18:45.980 --> 01:18:47.270
<v Speaker 2>It's heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1853
01:18:47.390 --> 01:18:48.830
<v Speaker 2>But I mean compared to other cards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1854
01:18:49.070 --> 01:18:54.070
<v Speaker 2>gold money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another way that people can buy gold </v>

1855
01:18:54.070 --> 01:18:54.070
<v Speaker 2>pimps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>labs,</v>

1856
01:18:54.590 --> 01:18:57.140
<v Speaker 2>they launched a company called Monet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1857
01:18:57.141 --> 01:18:58.700
<v Speaker 2>The website pulled up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a m,</v>

1858
01:18:58.701 --> 01:19:03.701
<v Speaker 2>e n e Dot Com,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is a great way for average </v>

1859
01:19:03.831 --> 01:19:08.480
<v Speaker 2>people to own gold but also killed two </v>
<v Speaker 2>birds with one stone because when you go</v>

1860
01:19:08.481 --> 01:19:09.680
<v Speaker 2>out and buy jewelry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1861
01:19:09.681 --> 01:19:13.370
<v Speaker 2>and you buy typical jewelry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's 14 karat gold,</v>

1862
01:19:13.371 --> 01:19:18.371
<v Speaker 2>18 carat gold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the men a jewelry is 24 carat gold and </v>

1863
01:19:18.371 --> 01:19:19.850
<v Speaker 2>they sell it by the weight of gold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you,</v>

1864
01:19:19.851 --> 01:19:24.851
<v Speaker 2>let's say you went and you went into a </v>
<v Speaker 2>department store and you spent a </v>

1865
01:19:24.851 --> 01:19:24.950
<v Speaker 2>thousand dollars on a gold necklace,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1866
01:19:25.190 --> 01:19:27.560
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you'd have $100 worth of gold </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>

1867
01:19:27.590 --> 01:19:32.590
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you spend a thousand dollars at </v>

1868
01:19:32.590 --> 01:19:35.011
<v Speaker 2>Manet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get $800 worth of gold </v>

1869
01:19:35.011 --> 01:19:37.880
<v Speaker 2>and manet will buy that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that necklace back from you at any point</v>

1870
01:19:37.881 --> 01:19:39.470
<v Speaker 2>in time in the future,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two years from now,</v>

1871
01:19:39.471 --> 01:19:44.471
<v Speaker 2>five years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 years from now at whatever the gold </v>

1872
01:19:44.471 --> 01:19:47.321
<v Speaker 2>value of the necklaces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's say gold goes up by 30 percent </v>

1873
01:19:47.321 --> 01:19:51.701
<v Speaker 2>from the time you buy the necklace,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can actually sell it back to monet </v>

1874
01:19:51.701 --> 01:19:52.820
<v Speaker 2>for more than you paid for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if you know,</v>

1875
01:19:52.821 --> 01:19:55.610
<v Speaker 2>if you have used jewelry that you buy at</v>
<v Speaker 2>a department store,</v>

1876
01:19:55.611 --> 01:19:57.230
<v Speaker 2>what's it worth on the secondhand </v>
<v Speaker 2>market?</v>

1877
01:19:57.280 --> 01:19:58.940
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ten cents on the dollar,</v>

1878
01:19:58.970 --> 01:19:59.930
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twenties maybe.</v>

1879
01:20:00.230 --> 01:20:05.230
<v Speaker 2>So this allows people to have nice </v>
<v Speaker 2>jewelry but also own real goal that the </v>

1880
01:20:05.230 --> 01:20:05.600
<v Speaker 2>same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1881
01:20:05.810 --> 01:20:07.920
<v Speaker 2>you're going to pay a higher premium to </v>
<v Speaker 2>buy</v>

1882
01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:09.870
<v Speaker 3>a gold necklace.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a pair of gold,</v>

1883
01:20:09.890 --> 01:20:12.150
<v Speaker 3>a gold cufflinks that I wear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my wife,</v>

1884
01:20:12.300 --> 01:20:17.300
<v Speaker 3>my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where's this been a jewelry all the </v>

1885
01:20:17.300 --> 01:20:17.300
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She wears it every day.</v>

1886
01:20:17.300 --> 01:20:17.300
<v Speaker 3>And so it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1887
01:20:17.300 --> 01:20:19.320
<v Speaker 3>you can buy it instead of buying other </v>
<v Speaker 3>jewelry,</v>

1888
01:20:19.890 --> 01:20:22.950
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not throwing your money away.</v>

1889
01:20:23.100 --> 01:20:24.780
<v Speaker 3>You're actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're actually getting also p.</v>

1890
01:20:24.900 --> 01:20:29.900
<v Speaker 3>But the point is that people need to </v>
<v Speaker 3>protect themselves from the inflation </v>

1891
01:20:29.900 --> 01:20:31.950
<v Speaker 3>that's coming because that is where </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're headed,</v>

1892
01:20:31.980 --> 01:20:32.270
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

1893
01:20:32.330 --> 01:20:37.330
<v Speaker 3>the government is going to continue to </v>
<v Speaker 3>print money to try to prop everything up</v>

1894
01:20:37.501 --> 01:20:39.570
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>try to delay the day of reckoning for as</v>

1895
01:20:39.571 --> 01:20:41.400
<v Speaker 3>long as they can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1896
01:20:41.401 --> 01:20:44.340
<v Speaker 3>we've had a rally in the dollar recently</v>
<v Speaker 3>because people think,</v>

1897
01:20:44.341 --> 01:20:46.200
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the trade war is good for the dollar.</v>

1898
01:20:46.350 --> 01:20:48.390
<v Speaker 3>They're wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a disaster for the dollar.</v>

1899
01:20:48.540 --> 01:20:50.190
<v Speaker 3>America can't win the trade war.</v>

1900
01:20:50.190 --> 01:20:55.190
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we benefit from the trade deficit right </v>

1901
01:20:55.190 --> 01:20:55.190
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All we can do is lose in the short run.</v>

1902
01:20:55.190 --> 01:20:59.990
<v Speaker 3>If we lose access to all those goods </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we're not having to pay for with </v>

1903
01:20:59.990 --> 01:20:59.990
<v Speaker 3>exports,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1904
01:20:59.990 --> 01:21:02.520
<v Speaker 3>they're actually trying to say that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>budget deficit is going up,</v>

1905
01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:07.880
<v Speaker 3>is good for the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a is good for the is good for the </v>

1906
01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:07.880
<v Speaker 3>dollar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When it's not,</v>

1907
01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:10.010
<v Speaker 3>I mean big budget deficits are always </v>
<v Speaker 3>bad for the dollar because it means that</v>

1908
01:21:10.011 --> 01:21:15.011
<v Speaker 3>government is creating more debt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're selling more bonds around the </v>

1909
01:21:15.011 --> 01:21:15.011
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>

1910
01:21:15.011 --> 01:21:19.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the supply of dollars also includes the </v>

1911
01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:19.920
<v Speaker 3>surprise of treasuries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so if you're flooding the world with</v>

1912
01:21:19.921 --> 01:21:20.600
<v Speaker 3>treasuries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

1913
01:21:20.670 --> 01:21:25.670
<v Speaker 3>you've got a surplus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a dollar's a dollar is going to lose </v>

1914
01:21:25.670 --> 01:21:27.891
<v Speaker 3>value.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so people have to find a way to </v>

1915
01:21:27.891 --> 01:21:27.891
<v Speaker 3>protect themselves and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the average guy,</v>

1916
01:21:27.891 --> 01:21:29.490
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gold is the easiest way to do that.</v>

1917
01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:30.520
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

1918
01:21:30.521 --> 01:21:32.310
<v Speaker 3>with the gold money account,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could do it very,</v>

1919
01:21:32.610 --> 01:21:33.600
<v Speaker 3>very inexpensive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>

1920
01:21:33.601 --> 01:21:35.790
<v Speaker 3>if you want to buy bigger amounts of </v>
<v Speaker 3>goal,</v>

1921
01:21:35.791 --> 01:21:38.130
<v Speaker 3>if someone wants to put $50,000,</v>
<v Speaker 3>$100,000</v>

1922
01:21:38.131 --> 01:21:40.170
<v Speaker 3>with a gold,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't spend it on jewelry,</v>

1923
01:21:40.650 --> 01:21:42.630
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could just buy regular goal.</v>

1924
01:21:42.631 --> 01:21:45.790
<v Speaker 3>I got a company shift gold,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right where I sell a,</v>

1925
01:21:45.810 --> 01:21:46.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maple leafs,</v>

1926
01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:52.040
<v Speaker 3>Krugerrands us a US buying gold jewelry </v>
<v Speaker 3>should be in addition to not,</v>

1927
01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:54.240
<v Speaker 3>not a primary investment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1928
01:21:54.300 --> 01:21:55.890
<v Speaker 3>because of the higher markup,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1929
01:21:55.891 --> 01:21:58.350
<v Speaker 3>When I sell gold bullion to people </v>
<v Speaker 3>coins,</v>

1930
01:21:58.440 --> 01:21:59.310
<v Speaker 3>we mark it up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1931
01:21:59.330 --> 01:22:00.240
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two percent.</v>

1932
01:22:00.270 --> 01:22:05.270
<v Speaker 3>It's a small markup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The markup on jewelry is higher because </v>

1933
01:22:05.270 --> 01:22:08.511
<v Speaker 3>we had to pay to make the jewelry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's more expensive to make a gold </v>

1934
01:22:08.511 --> 01:22:10.830
<v Speaker 3>necklace or a gold bracelet or a gold </v>
<v Speaker 3>ring than to make a gold coin,</v>

1935
01:22:11.100 --> 01:22:14.040
<v Speaker 3>so you wouldn't want to have all your </v>
<v Speaker 3>gold and jewelry,</v>

1936
01:22:14.370 --> 01:22:16.530
<v Speaker 3>but to the extent that you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>buy jewelry anyway,</v>

1937
01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:21.680
<v Speaker 3>you might as well buy real gold because </v>
<v Speaker 3>now you actually have some savings that </v>

1938
01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:24.420
<v Speaker 3>has value in addition to having </v>
<v Speaker 3>something you can wear.</v>

1939
01:22:24.420 --> 01:22:24.870
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

1940
01:22:24.871 --> 01:22:29.310
<v Speaker 3>I don't get a lot of value a day to day </v>
<v Speaker 3>by having golden is safe,</v>

1941
01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:31.800
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're wearing it right,</v>

1942
01:22:31.801 --> 01:22:36.801
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so then now you're getting an extra </v>

1943
01:22:36.801 --> 01:22:37.110
<v Speaker 3>benefit from the fact that you have gold</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you now,</v>

1944
01:22:37.111 --> 01:22:42.111
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get to enjoy it on a daily basis if </v>

1945
01:22:42.111 --> 01:22:42.510
<v Speaker 3>you're wearing it and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and obviously too,</v>

1946
01:22:42.511 --> 01:22:47.511
<v Speaker 3>if you don't have that much money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if someone's not going to buy any goal </v>

1947
01:22:47.511 --> 01:22:47.511
<v Speaker 3>that someone has a couple thousand </v>
<v Speaker 3>dollars and that's,</v>

1948
01:22:47.511 --> 01:22:48.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were going to spend it on jewelry.</v>

1949
01:22:48.990 --> 01:22:53.990
<v Speaker 3>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll spend it on gold jewelry because </v>

1950
01:22:53.990 --> 01:22:53.990
<v Speaker 3>at least you still have the money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1951
01:22:53.990 --> 01:22:56.090
<v Speaker 3>At least 80 percent of what you spent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You still have a.</v>

1952
01:22:56.160 --> 01:23:00.270
<v Speaker 3>well it makes sense to me and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>know much about gold,</v>

1953
01:23:00.810 --> 01:23:05.810
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's weird that gold is one of those </v>

1954
01:23:05.810 --> 01:23:05.810
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like universally been thought of as</v>

1955
01:23:05.810 --> 01:23:05.920
<v Speaker 3>valuable</v>

1956
01:23:06.310 --> 01:23:07.880
<v Speaker 2>like forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1957
01:23:07.881 --> 01:23:08.530
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's why.</v>

1958
01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:11.300
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean gold is always been a or anything</v>

1959
01:23:11.301 --> 01:23:12.710
<v Speaker 2>else like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me.</v>

1960
01:23:12.850 --> 01:23:14.740
<v Speaker 2>There are other metals that had been </v>
<v Speaker 2>used as money.</v>

1961
01:23:14.741 --> 01:23:16.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>silver has been used as money,</v>

1962
01:23:16.860 --> 01:23:21.860
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean gold has been the choice and </v>

1963
01:23:21.860 --> 01:23:23.230
<v Speaker 2>it looks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>central banks own a lot of gold.</v>

1964
01:23:23.350 --> 01:23:26.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean not as much as they used to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not as much as they should.</v>

1965
01:23:26.590 --> 01:23:27.810
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but central banks own it.</v>

1966
01:23:27.820 --> 01:23:29.020
<v Speaker 2>Gold's a monetary metal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1967
01:23:29.230 --> 01:23:31.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gold is used in a lot of things.</v>

1968
01:23:31.451 --> 01:23:32.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's in,</v>

1969
01:23:32.061 --> 01:23:34.780
<v Speaker 2>in cell phones and computers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's used in,</v>

1970
01:23:34.781 --> 01:23:35.300
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1971
01:23:35.310 --> 01:23:35.950
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1972
01:23:35.951 --> 01:23:37.900
<v Speaker 2>in medicine and dentistry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dentistry.</v>

1973
01:23:37.901 --> 01:23:42.901
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there are a lot of uses for it </v>

1974
01:23:42.901 --> 01:23:44.320
<v Speaker 2>because gold has properties that other </v>
<v Speaker 2>metals don't have that gives it value,</v>

1975
01:23:44.380 --> 01:23:48.190
<v Speaker 2>not just its physical beauty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also the things that you can do with</v>

1976
01:23:48.191 --> 01:23:48.310
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1977
01:23:48.370 --> 01:23:48.740
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1978
01:23:48.741 --> 01:23:50.740
<v Speaker 2>you can do things with gold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1979
01:23:50.770 --> 01:23:54.250
<v Speaker 2>that you can't do with other metals and </v>
<v Speaker 2>gold is not going to tarnish.</v>

1980
01:23:54.280 --> 01:23:55.180
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1981
01:23:55.181 --> 01:23:55.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rust,</v>

1982
01:23:56.130 --> 01:23:56.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's,</v>

1983
01:23:56.711 --> 01:24:01.711
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can make something out of it and </v>

1984
01:24:01.711 --> 01:24:01.711
<v Speaker 2>it's not going anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1985
01:24:01.711 --> 01:24:01.711
<v Speaker 2>You can also plate things with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rallies.</v>

1986
01:24:01.711 --> 01:24:03.430
<v Speaker 2>You can take a small piece of gold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could play this entire table.</v>

1987
01:24:03.490 --> 01:24:04.420
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1988
01:24:04.421 --> 01:24:06.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen that happen,</v>

1989
01:24:06.281 --> 01:24:08.530
<v Speaker 2>but I've had it explained to me it seems</v>
<v Speaker 2>very strange.</v>

1990
01:24:08.620 --> 01:24:10.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The property is that it has,</v>

1991
01:24:10.270 --> 01:24:15.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no other metal can replicate and that's </v>

1992
01:24:15.270 --> 01:24:16.480
<v Speaker 2>what are the reasons that it's been so </v>
<v Speaker 2>desirable for so many years,</v>

1993
01:24:16.660 --> 01:24:18.610
<v Speaker 2>but it also makes it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1994
01:24:18.670 --> 01:24:20.830
<v Speaker 2>ideally suited to be money and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1995
01:24:20.910 --> 01:24:25.910
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that we know Bitcoin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin is trying to digitally replicate</v>

1996
01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:27.490
<v Speaker 2>the properties of gold.</v>

1997
01:24:27.490 --> 01:24:32.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the whole selling point of </v>

1998
01:24:32.490 --> 01:24:32.490
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They say it's digital gold,</v>

1999
01:24:32.490 --> 01:24:32.490
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2000
01:24:32.490 --> 01:24:36.540
<v Speaker 2>and it does have a lot of golds </v>
<v Speaker 2>properties that helped it succeed as </v>

2001
01:24:36.540 --> 01:24:39.070
<v Speaker 2>money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't have any of gold physical</v>

2002
01:24:39.071 --> 01:24:41.530
<v Speaker 2>properties that gave it so much value in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first place.</v>

2003
01:24:42.070 --> 01:24:46.480
<v Speaker 2>And so you can't separate the intrinsic </v>
<v Speaker 2>value of money from money.</v>

2004
01:24:46.540 --> 01:24:49.180
<v Speaker 2>Money has to be a commodity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has to have value.</v>

2005
01:24:49.450 --> 01:24:51.310
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that that's where bitcoin fails.</v>

2006
01:24:51.311 --> 01:24:51.900
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just had it.</v>

2007
01:24:51.901 --> 01:24:56.410
<v Speaker 2>I had a debate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in New York and Soho last last week,</v>

2008
01:24:56.890 --> 01:25:00.090
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on bit coin a bit,</v>

2009
01:25:00.170 --> 01:25:05.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it was going to succeed and a </v>

2010
01:25:05.170 --> 01:25:06.200
<v Speaker 2>replace if he at currencies and </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically,</v>

2011
01:25:06.201 --> 01:25:07.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>candidly,</v>

2012
01:25:07.601 --> 01:25:09.580
<v Speaker 2>I lost a debate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it was rigged.</v>

2013
01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:11.650
<v Speaker 2>Was it really well because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2014
01:25:11.651 --> 01:25:12.580
<v Speaker 2>the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way they,</v>

2015
01:25:12.581 --> 01:25:16.040
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they decide to written the winter is um,</v>

2016
01:25:16.750 --> 01:25:21.750
<v Speaker 2>before the debate they have a poll and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they ask everybody where they stand and </v>

2017
01:25:22.061 --> 01:25:27.061
<v Speaker 2>then after the debate they asked them </v>
<v Speaker 2>where they stand now to see if people </v>

2018
01:25:27.061 --> 01:25:29.040
<v Speaker 2>changed their opinion and since </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody in there was,</v>

2019
01:25:29.041 --> 01:25:34.041
<v Speaker 2>it was a whole bitcoin audience and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>had a confirmed to me from several </v>

2020
01:25:34.041 --> 01:25:36.010
<v Speaker 2>sources that basically everybody was </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

2021
01:25:36.190 --> 01:25:41.190
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make sure you vote this way before the </v>

2022
01:25:41.190 --> 01:25:41.190
<v Speaker 2>debate.</v>

2023
01:25:41.190 --> 01:25:44.850
<v Speaker 2>So you can change your mind after the </v>
<v Speaker 2>debate so that the pro bitcoin guy is </v>

2024
01:25:44.850 --> 01:25:45.540
<v Speaker 2>going to win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

2025
01:25:45.630 --> 01:25:46.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2026
01:25:46.111 --> 01:25:46.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So did you,</v>

2027
01:25:47.020 --> 01:25:49.840
<v Speaker 2>did the initially vote neutral or anti </v>
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin?</v>

2028
01:25:49.841 --> 01:25:50.100
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2029
01:25:50.230 --> 01:25:55.230
<v Speaker 2>So the proposition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the proposition is we'll bitcoin replace</v>

2030
01:25:56.590 --> 01:25:59.350
<v Speaker 2>the dollar or other Fiat currencies </v>
<v Speaker 2>right in the future.</v>

2031
01:25:59.380 --> 01:26:02.530
<v Speaker 2>But they wanted to propose it initially </v>
<v Speaker 2>before the debate,</v>

2032
01:26:02.580 --> 01:26:03.680
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get your thoughts,</v>

2033
01:26:03.890 --> 01:26:07.250
<v Speaker 2>but they rigged it by having these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people have contrary thoughts.</v>

2034
01:26:07.251 --> 01:26:11.360
<v Speaker 2>Before the debate was if bitcoin was </v>
<v Speaker 2>evangelize to them,</v>

2035
01:26:11.361 --> 01:26:11.780
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2036
01:26:11.781 --> 01:26:16.781
<v Speaker 2>now I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea is to have as like a bunch of </v>

2037
01:26:16.781 --> 01:26:19.040
<v Speaker 2>people were in this debate that didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe bitcoin was the future,</v>

2038
01:26:19.310 --> 01:26:24.310
<v Speaker 2>but now after this hour debate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were convinced by my opponent that </v>

2039
01:26:24.310 --> 01:26:25.550
<v Speaker 2>it was the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because then,</v>

2040
01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:30.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I read all the stories and if you </v>

2041
01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:30.600
<v Speaker 2>go online,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you read the stories about the debate.</v>

2042
01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:33.560
<v Speaker 2>It's always like Peter Shift last.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Peter gets bested shift loses.</v>

2043
01:26:33.740 --> 01:26:35.090
<v Speaker 2>So it's all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like I got.</v>

2044
01:26:35.091 --> 01:26:37.460
<v Speaker 2>I got caught up in the bitcoin </v>
<v Speaker 2>propaganda,</v>

2045
01:26:37.490 --> 01:26:41.060
<v Speaker 2>but this is so much like you want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about tribalism,</v>

2046
01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:44.510
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin and crypto currency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those people are all in.</v>

2047
01:26:44.580 --> 01:26:45.120
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As I said,</v>

2048
01:26:45.290 --> 01:26:47.830
<v Speaker 2>my giant group of them that are just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2049
01:26:47.870 --> 01:26:49.670
<v Speaker 2>they're all in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said they're all in Puerto Rico now,</v>

2050
01:26:49.671 --> 01:26:54.160
<v Speaker 2>so I'm hanging around more of the crypto</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys than I used to.</v>

2051
01:26:54.170 --> 01:26:56.330
<v Speaker 2>And what is your take look?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2052
01:26:56.510 --> 01:26:58.490
<v Speaker 2>I feel badly in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2053
01:26:58.491 --> 01:27:00.080
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of them got very rich,</v>

2054
01:27:00.081 --> 01:27:03.030
<v Speaker 2>so I don't feel bad for these guys that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that,</v>

2055
01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:04.190
<v Speaker 2>that got rich.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They put,</v>

2056
01:27:04.191 --> 01:27:09.191
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a few thousand dollars in and not </v>

2057
01:27:09.191 --> 01:27:09.191
<v Speaker 2>millions of dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2058
01:27:09.191 --> 01:27:09.191
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously I,</v>

2059
01:27:09.191 --> 01:27:09.250
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2060
01:27:09.251 --> 01:27:10.850
<v Speaker 2>I've missed out on that myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2061
01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:14.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a lot of bubbles that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>missed out.</v>

2062
01:27:14.210 --> 01:27:16.310
<v Speaker 2>I didn't make anything on the DOTCOM </v>
<v Speaker 2>bubble.</v>

2063
01:27:16.311 --> 01:27:21.311
<v Speaker 2>I mean I made money when it came down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't make any money on the housing </v>

2064
01:27:21.311 --> 01:27:22.170
<v Speaker 2>bubble until it went down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2065
01:27:22.210 --> 01:27:24.110
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I missed out on the bitcoin bubble butt,</v>

2066
01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:27.430
<v Speaker 2>but this bubble was tailor made for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If there was ever a bubble that I should</v>

2067
01:27:27.431 --> 01:27:28.730
<v Speaker 2>have been part of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was this one,</v>

2068
01:27:28.731 --> 01:27:30.740
<v Speaker 2>this was all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was all for the Libertarians,</v>

2069
01:27:30.741 --> 01:27:32.150
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Free market guys,</v>

2070
01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:34.700
<v Speaker 2>anti a Fiat currency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2071
01:27:34.760 --> 01:27:36.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew about it early on.</v>

2072
01:27:36.351 --> 01:27:41.351
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not at the very beginning when it was </v>

2073
01:27:41.351 --> 01:27:41.390
<v Speaker 2>like pennies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I knew about it before it was $10.</v>

2074
01:27:41.450 --> 01:27:46.450
<v Speaker 2>I knew about it when it was pretty low.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much do you have invested in </v>

2075
01:27:46.450 --> 01:27:46.450
<v Speaker 2>Bitcoin?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2076
01:27:46.450 --> 01:27:46.450
<v Speaker 2>zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Zero.</v>

2077
01:27:46.450 --> 01:27:46.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2078
01:27:46.450 --> 01:27:46.450
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

2079
01:27:46.450 --> 01:27:51.340
<v Speaker 2>Oh actually no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got 50 bucks worth because no big </v>

2080
01:27:51.340 --> 01:27:51.340
<v Speaker 2>spender.</v>

2081
01:27:51.340 --> 01:27:51.340
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2082
01:27:51.340 --> 01:27:52.100
<v Speaker 2>what happened is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2083
01:27:52.101 --> 01:27:53.390
<v Speaker 2>after,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after,</v>

2084
01:27:53.450 --> 01:27:54.480
<v Speaker 2>after the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2085
01:27:54.530 --> 01:27:59.530
<v Speaker 2>the debate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went out to dinner with Eric </v>

2086
01:27:59.530 --> 01:27:59.530
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is my opponent,</v>

2087
01:27:59.530 --> 01:27:59.930
<v Speaker 2>his wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my wife was there,</v>

2088
01:27:59.940 --> 01:28:02.990
<v Speaker 2>we had a group of people and so they </v>
<v Speaker 2>gave me to show me how it works.</v>

2089
01:28:02.991 --> 01:28:06.320
<v Speaker 2>They gave me $100 with the bitcoin and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then I gave somebody back 50,</v>

2090
01:28:06.321 --> 01:28:08.600
<v Speaker 2>but I kept 50 of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I just in case.</v>

2091
01:28:08.601 --> 01:28:13.601
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although now it's only worth 40 acres </v>

2092
01:28:13.601 --> 01:28:13.601
<v Speaker 2>and it's gone down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It moves all over the place.</v>

2093
01:28:13.601 --> 01:28:13.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2094
01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:14.570
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2095
01:28:14.630 --> 01:28:16.160
<v Speaker 2>so I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel badly that,</v>

2096
01:28:16.161 --> 01:28:21.161
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of these guys looked into having a </v>

2097
01:28:21.161 --> 01:28:23.021
<v Speaker 2>lot of money or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's luck or they took a shot and it </v>

2098
01:28:23.021 --> 01:28:23.021
<v Speaker 2>paid off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2099
01:28:23.021 --> 01:28:23.021
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2100
01:28:23.021 --> 01:28:23.280
<v Speaker 2>they got in and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>

2101
01:28:23.350 --> 01:28:27.230
<v Speaker 2>the market exploded and they have an </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunity to cash out at a profit,</v>

2102
01:28:27.231 --> 01:28:28.760
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of them are not cashing out.</v>

2103
01:28:28.760 --> 01:28:30.560
<v Speaker 2>They're gonna I think they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go down with the ship.</v>

2104
01:28:31.010 --> 01:28:32.480
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

2105
01:28:32.490 --> 01:28:34.310
<v Speaker 2>when you say that you think it's going </v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

2106
01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:35.080
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause it's,</v>

2107
01:28:35.090 --> 01:28:37.940
<v Speaker 2>it's look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to succeed as money.</v>

2108
01:28:37.941 --> 01:28:40.550
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a highly speculative asset,</v>

2109
01:28:40.551 --> 01:28:42.590
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the last time I did your show,</v>

2110
01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:43.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people are,</v>

2111
01:28:43.850 --> 01:28:48.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what Peter Shift got wrong on Joe Rogan </v>

2112
01:28:48.850 --> 01:28:51.251
<v Speaker 2>about bitcoin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean everybody thinks I don't </v>

2113
01:28:51.251 --> 01:28:51.251
<v Speaker 2>understand it and that's why I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe in it.</v>

2114
01:28:51.251 --> 01:28:55.960
<v Speaker 2>It's because I do understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't believe that the people who </v>

2115
01:28:55.960 --> 01:28:59.080
<v Speaker 2>think it's going to work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they may understand the technology but </v>

2116
01:28:59.080 --> 01:28:59.360
<v Speaker 2>they don't understand money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2117
01:28:59.361 --> 01:29:01.230
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what I talked to these people,</v>

2118
01:29:01.231 --> 01:29:02.470
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2119
01:29:02.700 --> 01:29:05.700
<v Speaker 2>it's very much like a cult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2120
01:29:05.820 --> 01:29:06.620
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2121
01:29:06.621 --> 01:29:07.150
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2122
01:29:07.650 --> 01:29:10.080
<v Speaker 2>they believe so strongly in this.</v>

2123
01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:15.080
<v Speaker 2>They're so caught up in the hype and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>hysteria and maybe they're blinded by </v>

2124
01:29:15.080 --> 01:29:16.680
<v Speaker 2>the money they think they're gonna make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2125
01:29:16.681 --> 01:29:17.310
<v Speaker 2>when this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2126
01:29:17.311 --> 01:29:19.960
<v Speaker 2>these things are a million dollars a </v>
<v Speaker 2>piece or wherever they,</v>

2127
01:29:20.010 --> 01:29:25.010
<v Speaker 2>they believed they're going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the thing that's going to think it's </v>

2128
01:29:25.010 --> 01:29:25.010
<v Speaker 2>going to go to a million,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well there was an article last week,</v>

2129
01:29:25.010 --> 01:29:27.680
<v Speaker 2>some guy was saying 100 million,</v>
<v Speaker 2>$100,</v>

2130
01:29:27.681 --> 01:29:29.160
<v Speaker 2>million of Bitcoin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2131
01:29:29.161 --> 01:29:31.640
<v Speaker 2>that's why nobody wants to sell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2132
01:29:31.650 --> 01:29:34.270
<v Speaker 2>But the smart people are selling the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that got in early.</v>

2133
01:29:34.271 --> 01:29:39.271
<v Speaker 2>You're trying to con people into holding</v>
<v Speaker 2>on so that they can get out of $100 </v>

2134
01:29:39.271 --> 01:29:43.121
<v Speaker 2>million.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're talking about $100 million and </v>

2135
01:29:43.121 --> 01:29:43.121
<v Speaker 2>it's basically some numbers on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did they ever figure out who.</v>

2136
01:29:43.121 --> 01:29:45.630
<v Speaker 2>That's a Toshi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Toshi.</v>

2137
01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:48.690
<v Speaker 2>Dr Laura Nakamura.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2138
01:29:48.691 --> 01:29:51.030
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've been at the.</v>

2139
01:29:51.360 --> 01:29:54.150
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why the guy hasn't come </v>
<v Speaker 2>forward if it's a guy at all.</v>

2140
01:29:54.150 --> 01:29:56.160
<v Speaker 2>Someone said that they think it's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Elon Musk.</v>

2141
01:29:57.010 --> 01:29:58.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoever you,</v>

2142
01:29:58.080 --> 01:30:00.090
<v Speaker 2>whoever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you figure they've got a lot of bitcoin.</v>

2143
01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:05.720
<v Speaker 2>If they're real person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it might have been a group of </v>

2144
01:30:05.720 --> 01:30:05.720
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet.</v>

2145
01:30:05.720 --> 01:30:05.730
<v Speaker 2>Of course now it's not just bitcoin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2146
01:30:05.740 --> 01:30:10.740
<v Speaker 2>There's 1500 to 2000 of these other </v>
<v Speaker 2>cryptocurrencies will not just that </v>

2147
01:30:10.740 --> 01:30:11.130
<v Speaker 2>there's a bunch of different ones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2148
01:30:11.160 --> 01:30:13.280
<v Speaker 2>There's different variants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2149
01:30:13.290 --> 01:30:15.960
<v Speaker 2>And that's part of the problem because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they think,</v>

2150
01:30:15.961 --> 01:30:20.961
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's 21 million bitcoin and they </v>

2151
01:30:20.961 --> 01:30:20.961
<v Speaker 2>think that that means they're scarce.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2152
01:30:20.961 --> 01:30:25.191
<v Speaker 2>they're not scarce.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so many other currencies out </v>

2153
01:30:25.191 --> 01:30:25.860
<v Speaker 2>there and it's only scarce because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>coded to be scarce.</v>

2154
01:30:26.070 --> 01:30:28.500
<v Speaker 2>Gold is scarce because it really is </v>
<v Speaker 2>scarce.</v>

2155
01:30:28.760 --> 01:30:33.760
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin is scarce because they decided </v>

2156
01:30:33.760 --> 01:30:34.050
<v Speaker 2>to make it scarce,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not scarce in that bit.</v>

2157
01:30:34.110 --> 01:30:39.110
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing that any other </v>
<v Speaker 2>cryptocurrency can't do that bitcoin is </v>

2158
01:30:39.110 --> 01:30:39.110
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

2159
01:30:39.110 --> 01:30:43.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're looking at it as an </v>

2160
01:30:43.820 --> 01:30:45.171
<v Speaker 2>alternative not to gold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to the currency that we currently </v>

2161
01:30:45.171 --> 01:30:45.171
<v Speaker 2>use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well no,</v>

2162
01:30:45.171 --> 01:30:48.891
<v Speaker 2>they literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they look at it as an alternative to </v>

2163
01:30:48.891 --> 01:30:48.891
<v Speaker 2>both.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of them,</v>

2164
01:30:48.891 --> 01:30:49.800
<v Speaker 2>although some people think it's maybe a </v>
<v Speaker 2>compliment of goal,</v>

2165
01:30:49.801 --> 01:30:51.780
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't have any actual value.</v>

2166
01:30:51.781 --> 01:30:54.960
<v Speaker 2>And that's where I get into a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>arguments with these crypto guys because</v>

2167
01:30:54.961 --> 01:30:55.440
<v Speaker 2>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2168
01:30:55.441 --> 01:30:57.300
<v Speaker 2>gold doesn't have any actual value </v>
<v Speaker 2>either,</v>

2169
01:30:57.540 --> 01:31:00.780
<v Speaker 2>which is laughable because of course </v>
<v Speaker 2>gold has actual value.</v>

2170
01:31:00.990 --> 01:31:05.990
<v Speaker 2>There are lots of things that I can do </v>
<v Speaker 2>with gold and that shows that it has </v>

2171
01:31:05.990 --> 01:31:09.441
<v Speaker 2>value.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing that I can do with </v>

2172
01:31:09.441 --> 01:31:09.441
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin other than give it to somebody </v>
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>

2173
01:31:09.441 --> 01:31:13.251
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the whole purpose of it is to </v>

2174
01:31:13.251 --> 01:31:13.251
<v Speaker 2>give it to somebody else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but our whole economy's kind of screw.</v>

2175
01:31:13.251 --> 01:31:14.860
<v Speaker 2>It's entirely possible that it could </v>
<v Speaker 2>shift over to,</v>

2176
01:31:14.870 --> 01:31:16.950
<v Speaker 2>as a Crypto,</v>
<v Speaker 2>coin based economy,</v>

2177
01:31:18.130 --> 01:31:22.440
<v Speaker 2>cryptocurrency based economy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>governments could certainly issue crypto</v>

2178
01:31:22.640 --> 01:31:25.920
<v Speaker 2>Fiat currency the same way they issue </v>
<v Speaker 2>paper Fiat currency.</v>

2179
01:31:25.920 --> 01:31:30.920
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of our paper currency transactions </v>

2180
01:31:30.920 --> 01:31:30.920
<v Speaker 2>are digital anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2181
01:31:30.920 --> 01:31:32.100
<v Speaker 2>how much cash do you use on a daily </v>
<v Speaker 2>basis?</v>

2182
01:31:32.101 --> 01:31:35.430
<v Speaker 2>You use your credit card and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so banks are transferring.</v>

2183
01:31:35.610 --> 01:31:40.610
<v Speaker 2>They're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not shipping bills back and </v>

2184
01:31:40.610 --> 01:31:40.740
<v Speaker 2>forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mostly it's just numbers on a computer.</v>

2185
01:31:41.060 --> 01:31:46.060
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the government could certainly do </v>

2186
01:31:46.060 --> 01:31:46.060
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

2187
01:31:46.060 --> 01:31:48.111
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that would probably give them even </v>

2188
01:31:48.111 --> 01:31:50.151
<v Speaker 2>more control over the economy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a negative thing because at </v>

2189
01:31:50.151 --> 01:31:51.000
<v Speaker 2>least if you have cash,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can,</v>

2190
01:31:51.060 --> 01:31:54.180
<v Speaker 2>I can give you $100 and the government </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't see that transaction.</v>

2191
01:31:54.181 --> 01:31:59.181
<v Speaker 2>They're not spying on us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if they eliminated all cash and all </v>

2192
01:31:59.181 --> 01:32:00.850
<v Speaker 2>transactions were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they would know everything I did.</v>

2193
01:32:00.880 --> 01:32:05.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every dollar I spent would be recorded </v>

2194
01:32:05.880 --> 01:32:05.980
<v Speaker 2>on some government computer and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

2195
01:32:05.981 --> 01:32:07.750
<v Speaker 2>that's something that I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I don't want.</v>

2196
01:32:07.751 --> 01:32:08.320
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2197
01:32:08.321 --> 01:32:13.321
<v Speaker 2>Libertarians certainly don't want that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is one way cryptocurrencies could </v>

2198
01:32:13.321 --> 01:32:16.730
<v Speaker 2>backfire is if the governments end up </v>
<v Speaker 2>monopolizing a crypto currency,</v>

2199
01:32:16.940 --> 01:32:17.940
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

2200
01:32:18.070 --> 01:32:23.070
<v Speaker 2>and an issue cryptocurrency alongside or</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of the paper currencies that </v>

2201
01:32:23.171 --> 01:32:23.740
<v Speaker 2>they issue now.</v>

2202
01:32:23.740 --> 01:32:28.740
<v Speaker 2>But I think part of the biggest damage </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's ultimately going to come from it </v>

2203
01:32:28.740 --> 01:32:32.790
<v Speaker 2>is when the cryptocurrency currencies </v>
<v Speaker 2>collapsed and people lose a lot of </v>

2204
01:32:32.790 --> 01:32:32.790
<v Speaker 2>money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is going to happen.</v>

2205
01:32:33.040 --> 01:32:38.040
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the government is going to be able to </v>

2206
01:32:38.040 --> 01:32:38.040
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see,</v>

2207
01:32:38.040 --> 01:32:38.110
<v Speaker 2>we told you to free enterprise </v>
<v Speaker 2>capitalism is no good.</v>

2208
01:32:38.111 --> 01:32:39.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look what happens when you trust,</v>

2209
01:32:39.770 --> 01:32:40.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2210
01:32:40.370 --> 01:32:41.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bit coin,</v>

2211
01:32:41.980 --> 01:32:42.760
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's gonna,</v>

2212
01:32:42.761 --> 01:32:47.761
<v Speaker 2>it's gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's gonna help make the dollar and the </v>

2213
01:32:47.761 --> 01:32:47.761
<v Speaker 2>euro and the yen look good by </v>
<v Speaker 2>comparison.</v>

2214
01:32:47.761 --> 01:32:49.720
<v Speaker 2>Even though these are fatally fraud </v>
<v Speaker 2>currencies,</v>

2215
01:32:50.610 --> 01:32:55.610
<v Speaker 2>they're still going to look better than </v>
<v Speaker 2>the cryptocurrencies to the people who </v>

2216
01:32:55.610 --> 01:32:55.630
<v Speaker 2>have lost a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See Right now people,</v>

2217
01:32:55.740 --> 01:33:00.740
<v Speaker 2>there are a lot of people that like </v>
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin because they bought it real </v>

2218
01:33:00.740 --> 01:33:01.300
<v Speaker 2>cheap and even though it's gone down 70 </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent from its high,</v>

2219
01:33:01.301 --> 01:33:04.680
<v Speaker 2>it got up to 20,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now it's about 6,400.</v>

2220
01:33:05.410 --> 01:33:10.410
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of people that bought it </v>

2221
01:33:10.410 --> 01:33:10.410
<v Speaker 2>and still have big profits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what about the people that bought it</v>

2222
01:33:10.410 --> 01:33:11.570
<v Speaker 2>at 20,000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>18,000,</v>

2223
01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:13.360
<v Speaker 2>15,000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>$10,000,</v>

2224
01:33:13.450 --> 01:33:18.450
<v Speaker 2>they're losing money and if it keeps </v>
<v Speaker 2>falling and it goes down to 1000 or </v>

2225
01:33:18.450 --> 01:33:18.640
<v Speaker 2>lower,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where I think it's going,</v>

2226
01:33:19.030 --> 01:33:24.030
<v Speaker 2>you have a lot of people that have lost </v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of money and so that's going to </v>

2227
01:33:24.030 --> 01:33:28.291
<v Speaker 2>create a lot of problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think the government's gonna come </v>

2228
01:33:28.291 --> 01:33:30.661
<v Speaker 2>in with all sorts of new rules and new </v>
<v Speaker 2>regulations on transactions to try to </v>

2229
01:33:30.661 --> 01:33:33.010
<v Speaker 2>protect us from ourselves is again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just gonna,</v>

2230
01:33:33.390 --> 01:33:38.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>try to make government look good in the </v>

2231
01:33:38.390 --> 01:33:38.390
<v Speaker 2>free market,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look bad.</v>

2232
01:33:38.390 --> 01:33:39.850
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people get caught up in frenzies all the</v>

2233
01:33:39.851 --> 01:33:44.851
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean that the free market </v>

2234
01:33:44.851 --> 01:33:44.851
<v Speaker 2>needs to be shut down just because every</v>
<v Speaker 2>once in awhile you know,</v>

2235
01:33:44.851 --> 01:33:49.830
<v Speaker 2>people get greedy and get nuts and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>not a reason to expand the power of </v>

2236
01:33:50.351 --> 01:33:55.351
<v Speaker 2>government because government will do </v>
<v Speaker 2>much more damage to an economy then </v>

2237
01:33:55.351 --> 01:33:56.900
<v Speaker 2>small bubbles will do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you know,</v>

2238
01:33:56.920 --> 01:33:58.960
<v Speaker 2>when you have a boom and a bust because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a mania.</v>

2239
01:33:59.350 --> 01:34:00.080
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that</v>

2240
01:34:00.100 --> 01:34:02.380
<v Speaker 4>there's any cryptocurrencies that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>compelling?</v>

2241
01:34:02.770 --> 01:34:07.770
<v Speaker 4>Is there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is there anyone other than bitcoin that </v>

2242
01:34:07.770 --> 01:34:07.770
<v Speaker 4>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2243
01:34:07.770 --> 01:34:08.380
<v Speaker 4>this one has a different set of </v>
<v Speaker 4>parameters or different set of rules?</v>

2244
01:34:08.460 --> 01:34:09.390
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because to me,</v>

2245
01:34:09.391 --> 01:34:10.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2246
01:34:10.120 --> 01:34:12.240
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just can't have a,</v>

2247
01:34:12.360 --> 01:34:13.560
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

2248
01:34:13.561 --> 01:34:18.561
<v Speaker 2>a digital token that you just create </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's going to have going to be a store</v>

2249
01:34:19.430 --> 01:34:20.070
<v Speaker 2>value.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2250
01:34:20.071 --> 01:34:22.470
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Money has to be a store of value.</v>

2251
01:34:22.471 --> 01:34:24.330
<v Speaker 2>It has to be a medium of deferred </v>
<v Speaker 2>payment.</v>

2252
01:34:24.450 --> 01:34:26.100
<v Speaker 2>So what that means is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2253
01:34:26.101 --> 01:34:28.740
<v Speaker 2>I have to be able to take my money and </v>
<v Speaker 2>save it for a year,</v>

2254
01:34:28.770 --> 01:34:29.970
<v Speaker 2>five years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 years.</v>

2255
01:34:30.090 --> 01:34:31.830
<v Speaker 2>I have to be able to make a loan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2256
01:34:31.831 --> 01:34:35.430
<v Speaker 2>I can loan you money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't loan you a bitcoin and you say,</v>

2257
01:34:35.431 --> 01:34:38.530
<v Speaker 2>I'll pay the bitcoin back in 10 years </v>
<v Speaker 2>because none of us know what the bitcoin</v>

2258
01:34:38.531 --> 01:34:41.100
<v Speaker 2>is going to be worth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how do you know what kind of interest</v>

2259
01:34:41.101 --> 01:34:44.070
<v Speaker 2>rate to charge a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to have stable money.</v>

2260
01:34:44.360 --> 01:34:49.360
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't think any of these </v>

2261
01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:51.021
<v Speaker 2>cryptocurrencies can ever be stable </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's no real value to </v>

2262
01:34:51.021 --> 01:34:51.360
<v Speaker 2>stabilize.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People say it's a store of value,</v>

2263
01:34:51.361 --> 01:34:56.361
<v Speaker 2>but there's no value to store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the only cryptocurrencies that would </v>

2264
01:34:56.361 --> 01:34:57.950
<v Speaker 2>work would be crypto currencies that </v>
<v Speaker 2>were backed by</v>

2265
01:34:58.010 --> 01:35:00.350
<v Speaker 3>a real commodity like gold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that can work.</v>

2266
01:35:00.620 --> 01:35:05.620
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what gold money does is actually </v>

2267
01:35:05.620 --> 01:35:06.140
<v Speaker 3>something better because you don't have </v>
<v Speaker 3>to have a crypto currency,</v>

2268
01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:11.560
<v Speaker 3>you just have actual goal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See the reason that currency existed in </v>

2269
01:35:11.560 --> 01:35:13.460
<v Speaker 3>the first place because currency was </v>
<v Speaker 3>always backed by real money.</v>

2270
01:35:13.670 --> 01:35:15.720
<v Speaker 3>So let's say I had gold,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2271
01:35:15.740 --> 01:35:18.500
<v Speaker 3>that I was storing at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at a blacksmith.</v>

2272
01:35:19.030 --> 01:35:21.590
<v Speaker 3>I had a bar gold and I had a piece of </v>
<v Speaker 3>paper that said,</v>

2273
01:35:21.620 --> 01:35:22.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2274
01:35:22.700 --> 01:35:24.980
<v Speaker 3>pay to the bear on demand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know this bar gold,</v>

2275
01:35:25.010 --> 01:35:30.010
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was written from a reputable </v>

2276
01:35:30.010 --> 01:35:31.130
<v Speaker 3>blacksmith.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could negotiate that piece of paper.</v>

2277
01:35:31.131 --> 01:35:32.720
<v Speaker 3>I can give you that piece of paper and </v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

2278
01:35:32.721 --> 01:35:37.721
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I own some goal that this blacksmith </v>

2279
01:35:37.721 --> 01:35:37.721
<v Speaker 3>take this piece of paper and now you own</v>
<v Speaker 3>the gold.</v>

2280
01:35:37.790 --> 01:35:42.790
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And and so that piece of paper is </v>

2281
01:35:42.790 --> 01:35:42.790
<v Speaker 3>functioning as a money substitute as </v>
<v Speaker 3>currency,</v>

2282
01:35:42.790 --> 01:35:43.880
<v Speaker 3>but the real money is in a vault.</v>

2283
01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:46.010
<v Speaker 3>It's gold,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's.</v>

2284
01:35:46.011 --> 01:35:47.450
<v Speaker 3>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard for me to.</v>

2285
01:35:47.510 --> 01:35:50.900
<v Speaker 3>I can't break up that bar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't just give you a small portion of</v>

2286
01:35:50.901 --> 01:35:55.901
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what gold money is doing is taking </v>

2287
01:35:55.901 --> 01:35:58.211
<v Speaker 3>that old blacksmith concept and bring it</v>
<v Speaker 3>into the modern era because I can store </v>

2288
01:35:58.851 --> 01:36:03.851
<v Speaker 3>my gold in a vault at breaks through </v>
<v Speaker 3>gold money and now I can transfer any </v>

2289
01:36:04.761 --> 01:36:07.070
<v Speaker 3>portion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can give you a gram of my goal,</v>

2290
01:36:07.071 --> 01:36:12.071
<v Speaker 3>that tiny amount of goal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can just send it to you for free and </v>

2291
01:36:12.071 --> 01:36:15.851
<v Speaker 3>now you own that goal because now the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ownership register is going to be </v>

2292
01:36:15.851 --> 01:36:19.421
<v Speaker 3>changed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And instead of being in Peter Schiff's </v>

2293
01:36:19.421 --> 01:36:19.421
<v Speaker 3>name,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be in Joe Rogan's name.</v>

2294
01:36:19.421 --> 01:36:24.250
<v Speaker 3>And so once you can do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once I can take a bar of gold and and </v>

2295
01:36:24.250 --> 01:36:28.690
<v Speaker 3>turn it into liquid money that can be </v>
<v Speaker 3>used to buy a cup of coffee and you're </v>

2296
01:36:28.690 --> 01:36:32.190
<v Speaker 3>doing all these without having physical </v>
<v Speaker 3>control of the Gold Nano,</v>

2297
01:36:32.220 --> 01:36:33.920
<v Speaker 3>some physically holding it in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>hands.</v>

2298
01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:35.120
<v Speaker 3>It's in a vault somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2299
01:36:35.121 --> 01:36:40.121
<v Speaker 3>Well somebody has to have physical </v>
<v Speaker 3>control and that's what a lot of the </v>

2300
01:36:40.121 --> 01:36:42.000
<v Speaker 3>bitcoin advocates don't like about </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like a gold mine.</v>

2301
01:36:42.001 --> 01:36:42.290
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2302
01:36:42.291 --> 01:36:44.840
<v Speaker 3>you have to trust a third party to store</v>
<v Speaker 3>your goal.</v>

2303
01:36:45.020 --> 01:36:46.820
<v Speaker 3>Yes you do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2304
01:36:46.821 --> 01:36:50.510
<v Speaker 3>but people have been trusting third </v>
<v Speaker 3>parties with gold for thousands of years</v>

2305
01:36:50.750 --> 01:36:53.840
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have reliable third parties that can</v>

2306
01:36:53.841 --> 01:36:58.160
<v Speaker 3>hold onto something of real value </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you have to have stability.</v>

2307
01:36:58.190 --> 01:37:03.190
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's the big problem that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>have in the world today is we have no </v>

2308
01:37:03.190 --> 01:37:06.161
<v Speaker 3>real money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just have these Fiat currencies that </v>

2309
01:37:06.161 --> 01:37:09.071
<v Speaker 3>governments create out of thin air and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no real stability in the </v>

2310
01:37:09.071 --> 01:37:10.190
<v Speaker 3>monetary system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we had real money,</v>

2311
01:37:10.191 --> 01:37:15.191
<v Speaker 3>if we were on a gold standard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I believe we will be on again </v>

2312
01:37:15.191 --> 01:37:18.101
<v Speaker 3>eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because that is the norm throughout </v>

2313
01:37:18.101 --> 01:37:18.101
<v Speaker 3>history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is to be on a gold standard.</v>

2314
01:37:18.101 --> 01:37:19.610
<v Speaker 3>All these experiments with Fiat </v>
<v Speaker 3>currency,</v>

2315
01:37:19.611 --> 01:37:24.611
<v Speaker 3>they don't work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They haven't done in a gold standard </v>

2316
01:37:24.611 --> 01:37:24.611
<v Speaker 3>since when the seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2317
01:37:24.611 --> 01:37:24.611
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2318
01:37:24.611 --> 01:37:25.400
<v Speaker 3>we went off at 1971.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>

2319
01:37:25.401 --> 01:37:27.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>w w we were on a pure gold standard,</v>

2320
01:37:28.190 --> 01:37:28.850
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2321
01:37:28.851 --> 01:37:32.090
<v Speaker 3>in the 19th century and certainly the </v>
<v Speaker 3>latter part of it.</v>

2322
01:37:32.420 --> 01:37:34.610
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and even think we're going to go back to</v>

2323
01:37:34.611 --> 01:37:36.890
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think so because that's what works.</v>

2324
01:37:37.070 --> 01:37:39.140
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we have now works for government,</v>

2325
01:37:39.141 --> 01:37:42.290
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't work for the people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't work for prosperity.</v>

2326
01:37:42.291 --> 01:37:42.650
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

2327
01:37:42.800 --> 01:37:46.970
<v Speaker 3>when trump is out there trying to say we</v>
<v Speaker 3>have the greatest economy in history.</v>

2328
01:37:47.060 --> 01:37:47.930
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it isn't,</v>

2329
01:37:48.200 --> 01:37:49.340
<v Speaker 3>it isn't even close.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2330
01:37:49.341 --> 01:37:54.341
<v Speaker 3>forget about the fact that it's not even</v>
<v Speaker 3>better than it was when Obama was </v>

2331
01:37:54.341 --> 01:37:54.470
<v Speaker 3>president and he said that was an </v>
<v Speaker 3>economic wasteland.</v>

2332
01:37:54.740 --> 01:37:56.130
<v Speaker 3>But go back to</v>

2333
01:37:56.400 --> 01:37:58.530
<v Speaker 2>the period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say 18,</v>

2334
01:37:58.531 --> 01:38:02.630
<v Speaker 2>70 through 1910 are in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2335
01:38:02.820 --> 01:38:06.510
<v Speaker 2>that was the golden age of America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2336
01:38:06.511 --> 01:38:09.960
<v Speaker 2>that is what created the middle class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The middle class was,</v>

2337
01:38:10.130 --> 01:38:14.400
<v Speaker 2>was a byproduct of the economic growth </v>
<v Speaker 2>that took place in America.</v>

2338
01:38:14.730 --> 01:38:15.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

2339
01:38:15.220 --> 01:38:20.220
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we basically had tremendous economic </v>

2340
01:38:20.220 --> 01:38:23.601
<v Speaker 2>growth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We absorbed tens of millions of </v>

2341
01:38:23.601 --> 01:38:26.810
<v Speaker 2>immigrants that were coming from all </v>
<v Speaker 2>over the world and they weren't coming </v>

2342
01:38:26.810 --> 01:38:28.200
<v Speaker 2>here for welfare and food stamps because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't exist.</v>

2343
01:38:28.380 --> 01:38:30.440
<v Speaker 2>There was no minimum wage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2344
01:38:30.500 --> 01:38:35.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was just freedom here and people </v>

2345
01:38:35.500 --> 01:38:38.181
<v Speaker 2>came here from all around the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they can be freer in America </v>

2346
01:38:38.181 --> 01:38:41.211
<v Speaker 2>than they could be any place else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was those free Americans working </v>

2347
01:38:41.211 --> 01:38:44.980
<v Speaker 2>with a gold standard with a solid sound </v>
<v Speaker 2>money that created the greatest amount </v>

2348
01:38:44.980 --> 01:38:49.071
<v Speaker 2>of economic growth that the world has </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever seen in the shortest amount of </v>

2349
01:38:49.071 --> 01:38:49.071
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

2350
01:38:49.071 --> 01:38:49.071
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people talk about,</v>

2351
01:38:49.071 --> 01:38:50.040
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how great the Chinese economy is,</v>

2352
01:38:50.041 --> 01:38:50.370
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2353
01:38:50.371 --> 01:38:53.610
<v Speaker 2>look back at the American economy during</v>
<v Speaker 2>that period.</v>

2354
01:38:53.970 --> 01:38:56.430
<v Speaker 2>And that was tremendous growth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>

2355
01:38:56.431 --> 01:38:58.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could have great growth again,</v>

2356
01:38:59.030 --> 01:39:04.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the extent that we do substantially </v>

2357
01:39:04.030 --> 01:39:07.190
<v Speaker 2>diminished the size of government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but part of that would be to return to </v>

2358
01:39:07.190 --> 01:39:10.200
<v Speaker 2>sound money and that would be gold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the cult of personality,</v>

2359
01:39:10.290 --> 01:39:10.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2360
01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:12.720
<v Speaker 2>it's one of those things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2361
01:39:12.750 --> 01:39:17.750
<v Speaker 2>I don't know this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is such a fascinating conversation </v>

2362
01:39:17.750 --> 01:39:21.981
<v Speaker 2>because I would love to have a person </v>
<v Speaker 2>who's equally educated on this stuff </v>

2363
01:39:21.981 --> 01:39:24.690
<v Speaker 2>that opposes your viewpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'd love to see.</v>

2364
01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:25.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well they're,</v>

2365
01:39:25.351 --> 01:39:25.820
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

2366
01:39:25.850 --> 01:39:27.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's certainly people that have posed</v>

2367
01:39:27.531 --> 01:39:29.040
<v Speaker 2>my viewpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no shortage of them.</v>

2368
01:39:29.540 --> 01:39:30.310
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2369
01:39:30.360 --> 01:39:31.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2370
01:39:31.080 --> 01:39:33.420
<v Speaker 2>I'd be happy to come on to show you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't think they're correct.</v>

2371
01:39:33.480 --> 01:39:34.290
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2372
01:39:34.291 --> 01:39:35.340
<v Speaker 2>they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not correct at all.</v>

2373
01:39:35.370 --> 01:39:35.940
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2374
01:39:36.030 --> 01:39:41.030
<v Speaker 2>before I forget too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forgot to bring this up because you </v>

2375
01:39:41.030 --> 01:39:41.730
<v Speaker 2>mentioned it on the other podcast and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

2376
01:39:41.731 --> 01:39:43.630
<v Speaker 2>I wish somebody would come in and talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>to me about it.</v>

2377
01:39:43.680 --> 01:39:43.950
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2378
01:39:43.951 --> 01:39:44.550
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got It.</v>

2379
01:39:44.570 --> 01:39:47.220
<v Speaker 2>I got to talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is the act 20,</v>

2380
01:39:47.250 --> 01:39:52.250
<v Speaker 2>22 in Puerto Rico and whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 2>Puerto Rico is in trouble because you </v>

2381
01:39:52.250 --> 01:39:53.880
<v Speaker 2>have a bunch of rich people who were </v>
<v Speaker 2>there who are not paying taxes.</v>

2382
01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:54.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the,</v>

2383
01:39:54.731 --> 01:39:55.560
<v Speaker 2>the charge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2384
01:39:55.561 --> 01:40:00.561
<v Speaker 2>The reason why it was so difficult to </v>
<v Speaker 2>rebuild the infrastructure post Maria </v>

2385
01:40:00.561 --> 01:40:05.240
<v Speaker 2>was that all you rich guys come there </v>
<v Speaker 2>and soaked up the economy and that's why</v>

2386
01:40:05.791 --> 01:40:07.980
<v Speaker 2>you're there because you weren't paying </v>
<v Speaker 2>any taxes.</v>

2387
01:40:08.010 --> 01:40:09.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so first of all,</v>

2388
01:40:09.230 --> 01:40:09.990
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2389
01:40:10.230 --> 01:40:13.380
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tax breaks didn't start until 2012.</v>

2390
01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:17.010
<v Speaker 2>And before that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was going on in the same,</v>

2391
01:40:17.190 --> 01:40:17.820
<v Speaker 2>it changed.</v>

2392
01:40:17.850 --> 01:40:19.350
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you were rich in Puerto Rico,</v>

2393
01:40:19.351 --> 01:40:22.920
<v Speaker 2>you paid the same 30 percent tax,</v>
<v Speaker 2>federal tax.</v>

2394
01:40:22.921 --> 01:40:25.710
<v Speaker 2>Everybody else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody in Puerto Rico has to pay federal</v>

2395
01:40:25.711 --> 01:40:30.711
<v Speaker 2>income taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is one of the big benefits that </v>

2396
01:40:30.711 --> 01:40:30.990
<v Speaker 2>Puerto Rico has.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to pay the federal income</v>

2397
01:40:30.991 --> 01:40:33.780
<v Speaker 2>tax if you live there when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>working there on the money you earned.</v>

2398
01:40:34.410 --> 01:40:39.150
<v Speaker 2>So if I had moved to Puerto Rico in 2010</v>
<v Speaker 2>or 2011,</v>

2399
01:40:39.180 --> 01:40:41.580
<v Speaker 2>which I did not do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but how do I move there?</v>

2400
01:40:41.581 --> 01:40:46.581
<v Speaker 2>Then I would have had to pay the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>high Puerto Rican income tax that </v>

2401
01:40:46.581 --> 01:40:50.211
<v Speaker 2>everybody else in Puerto Rico's pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what enticed a lot of people to move</v>

2402
01:40:50.311 --> 01:40:52.920
<v Speaker 2>to Puerto Rico was the fact that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>reduced the taxes.</v>

2403
01:40:53.260 --> 01:40:55.300
<v Speaker 2>Now the taxes are in zero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2404
01:40:55.720 --> 01:40:57.190
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you come there,</v>

2405
01:40:57.400 --> 01:41:02.400
<v Speaker 2>you're still gonna pay taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm on some of the money that you </v>

2406
01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:07.231
<v Speaker 2>weren't like my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my business pays a four percent </v>

2407
01:41:07.231 --> 01:41:07.231
<v Speaker 2>corporate tax.</v>

2408
01:41:07.231 --> 01:41:10.650
<v Speaker 2>So it's not zero pay four percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can give myself a dividend that's tax </v>

2409
01:41:10.650 --> 01:41:12.820
<v Speaker 2>free,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the corporations are required to pay</v>

2410
01:41:12.821 --> 01:41:15.700
<v Speaker 2>out a certain amount of taxable salary </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the owners.</v>

2411
01:41:15.790 --> 01:41:20.200
<v Speaker 2>So some of my salary is taxed as high as</v>
<v Speaker 2>30 percent.</v>

2412
01:41:20.590 --> 01:41:23.950
<v Speaker 2>The majority of it is taxed basically at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the four percent,</v>

2413
01:41:23.951 --> 01:41:27.520
<v Speaker 2>but four percent of something is better </v>
<v Speaker 2>than 30 percent of nothing.</v>

2414
01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:29.590
<v Speaker 2>Plus they're getting 30 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

2415
01:41:29.740 --> 01:41:33.970
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of the people who have moved to</v>
<v Speaker 2>Puerto Rico over the last,</v>

2416
01:41:33.990 --> 01:41:34.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five,</v>

2417
01:41:34.511 --> 01:41:39.511
<v Speaker 2>six,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven years that didn't live there </v>

2418
01:41:39.511 --> 01:41:41.341
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are paying a lot of taxes now to the </v>

2419
01:41:41.341 --> 01:41:43.270
<v Speaker 2>Puerto Rican government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though the rate is very low,</v>

2420
01:41:43.480 --> 01:41:48.480
<v Speaker 2>the dollar amount is very high and each </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual person who was moved there is</v>

2421
01:41:49.001 --> 01:41:52.660
<v Speaker 2>paying a lot more taxes than the average</v>
<v Speaker 2>Puerto Rican who's already living there,</v>

2422
01:41:52.870 --> 01:41:53.740
<v Speaker 2>paying the higher rate.</v>

2423
01:41:53.740 --> 01:41:58.740
<v Speaker 2>So the people who moved there bought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brought significant tax revenue that </v>

2424
01:41:58.740 --> 01:42:00.310
<v Speaker 2>Puerto Rico never was going to get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because remember,</v>

2425
01:42:00.311 --> 01:42:02.290
<v Speaker 2>if they were taxing people at 30 </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent,</v>

2426
01:42:02.500 --> 01:42:05.800
<v Speaker 2>people from California wouldn't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>moved their people from New York.</v>

2427
01:42:06.160 --> 01:42:07.870
<v Speaker 2>People from New Jersey wouldn't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>moved there.</v>

2428
01:42:07.990 --> 01:42:12.990
<v Speaker 2>It was the low taxes that brought all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these people to Puerto Rico who never </v>

2429
01:42:12.990 --> 01:42:14.230
<v Speaker 2>would have been there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're now paying taxes.</v>

2430
01:42:14.290 --> 01:42:19.290
<v Speaker 2>But more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're hiring people who are also </v>

2431
01:42:19.290 --> 01:42:22.291
<v Speaker 2>paying taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're spending a lot of money locally </v>

2432
01:42:22.291 --> 01:42:23.830
<v Speaker 2>in the economy generating revenue and </v>
<v Speaker 2>jobs.</v>

2433
01:42:24.050 --> 01:42:25.720
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they've been a big plus.</v>

2434
01:42:25.900 --> 01:42:29.230
<v Speaker 2>And I can tell you the people who have </v>
<v Speaker 2>moved their,</v>

2435
01:42:29.231 --> 01:42:34.231
<v Speaker 2>myself included,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we donated a lot of money to the relief </v>

2436
01:42:34.231 --> 01:42:38.191
<v Speaker 2>efforts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean as soon as that hurricane was </v>

2437
01:42:38.191 --> 01:42:38.191
<v Speaker 2>over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the acts 20,</v>

2438
01:42:38.191 --> 01:42:42.091
<v Speaker 2>22 people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what they'd be called because </v>

2439
01:42:42.091 --> 01:42:42.091
<v Speaker 2>they went there to participate.</v>

2440
01:42:42.091 --> 01:42:44.230
<v Speaker 2>They were raising money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were helping out.</v>

2441
01:42:44.231 --> 01:42:46.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's a lot of charity that came to</v>

2442
01:42:46.541 --> 01:42:51.541
<v Speaker 2>Puerto Rico that a lot of these people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they wouldn't have thought of it that </v>

2443
01:42:51.541 --> 01:42:54.571
<v Speaker 2>they didn't already live there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But by bringing a lot of wealthy people </v>

2444
01:42:54.571 --> 01:42:55.330
<v Speaker 2>down there to Puerto Rico and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're living it,</v>

2445
01:42:55.630 --> 01:43:00.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're more inclined to help out their </v>

2446
01:43:00.630 --> 01:43:00.630
<v Speaker 2>neighbors then when they were still </v>
<v Speaker 2>living in the US.</v>

2447
01:43:00.630 --> 01:43:05.110
<v Speaker 2>So Puerto Rico has derive significant </v>
<v Speaker 2>benefit from an influx of wealthy </v>

2448
01:43:05.981 --> 01:43:10.981
<v Speaker 2>entrepreneurs who have taken advantage </v>
<v Speaker 2>of them and that you move in there and </v>

2449
01:43:11.621 --> 01:43:15.400
<v Speaker 2>just exploiting that place by getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>paid and low taxes and that it's,</v>

2450
01:43:15.520 --> 01:43:20.520
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a bad thing for the people that </v>

2451
01:43:20.520 --> 01:43:20.520
<v Speaker 2>live there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a false still.</v>

2452
01:43:20.520 --> 01:43:22.930
<v Speaker 2>It's a great thing for the people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>lived there because people are coming to</v>

2453
01:43:22.931 --> 01:43:24.820
<v Speaker 2>the island,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bringing capital,</v>

2454
01:43:25.060 --> 01:43:28.180
<v Speaker 2>bringing businesses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bringing employment opportunities,</v>

2455
01:43:28.390 --> 01:43:30.670
<v Speaker 2>paying taxes that they never would have </v>
<v Speaker 2>paid.</v>

2456
01:43:30.720 --> 01:43:32.800
<v Speaker 2>And let me ask you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is key you ever anticipated.</v>

2457
01:43:32.801 --> 01:43:37.801
<v Speaker 2>I mean it seems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is Puerto Rico as big as any state </v>

2458
01:43:37.801 --> 01:43:38.080
<v Speaker 2>is as big as Rhode Island?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how big?</v>

2459
01:43:38.360 --> 01:43:39.480
<v Speaker 2>It's small.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2460
01:43:39.481 --> 01:43:44.481
<v Speaker 2>I mean geographically it may be about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the size is like 30 miles maybe and </v>

2461
01:43:44.481 --> 01:43:46.060
<v Speaker 2>that's the length.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's skinnier than that.</v>

2462
01:43:46.240 --> 01:43:49.120
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a small place but you know,</v>

2463
01:43:49.121 --> 01:43:54.121
<v Speaker 2>relative to the Caribbean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you compare it to other </v>

2464
01:43:54.121 --> 01:43:54.121
<v Speaker 2>Caribbean islands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty big.</v>

2465
01:43:54.121 --> 01:43:55.610
<v Speaker 2>How long is the flight from New York to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Puerto Rico?</v>

2466
01:43:55.970 --> 01:43:57.710
<v Speaker 2>Actually in the air it's about three </v>
<v Speaker 2>hours,</v>

2467
01:43:57.740 --> 01:43:58.970
<v Speaker 2>but I think the airlines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2468
01:43:58.971 --> 01:44:00.130
<v Speaker 2>they leave about four.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2469
01:44:00.150 --> 01:44:05.150
<v Speaker 2>if you look at the flight time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but actually from wheels up to wheels </v>

2470
01:44:05.150 --> 01:44:05.900
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's about a three hour flight.</v>

2471
01:44:05.901 --> 01:44:07.940
<v Speaker 2>So it's not far and there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2472
01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:11.720
<v Speaker 2>there are a lot of places that you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>fly direct to go to the west coast.</v>

2473
01:44:11.750 --> 01:44:12.430
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotTa,</v>

2474
01:44:12.440 --> 01:44:17.440
<v Speaker 2>you know you got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would there be a way that all these </v>

2475
01:44:17.440 --> 01:44:20.120
<v Speaker 2>people coming in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they could somehow or another fix this,</v>

2476
01:44:20.670 --> 01:44:23.150
<v Speaker 2>the whole electrical system that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>have their,</v>

2477
01:44:23.151 --> 01:44:24.890
<v Speaker 2>their power grid and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2478
01:44:24.891 --> 01:44:26.210
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the power grid,</v>

2479
01:44:26.211 --> 01:44:29.720
<v Speaker 2>this just shows you all the people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>think socialism is so great.</v>

2480
01:44:30.170 --> 01:44:33.050
<v Speaker 2>Look at Puerto Rico.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why they're broke,</v>

2481
01:44:33.320 --> 01:44:36.200
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The socialist destroyed Puerto Rico,</v>

2482
01:44:36.320 --> 01:44:41.320
<v Speaker 2>the socialist in Puerto Rico,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and of course the ones that we have in </v>

2483
01:44:41.320 --> 01:44:42.680
<v Speaker 2>Washington because all their problems </v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't self inflicted,</v>

2484
01:44:42.980 --> 01:44:46.400
<v Speaker 2>but we created a problem for Puerto Rico</v>
<v Speaker 2>a number,</v>

2485
01:44:46.490 --> 01:44:48.320
<v Speaker 2>a number of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

2486
01:44:48.410 --> 01:44:50.330
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have the minimum wage that,</v>

2487
01:44:50.490 --> 01:44:55.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the average income in Puerto Rico is </v>

2488
01:44:55.490 --> 01:44:55.700
<v Speaker 2>half of the poorest state in the United </v>
<v Speaker 2>States,</v>

2489
01:44:56.060 --> 01:44:57.200
<v Speaker 2>which I forget.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget,</v>

2490
01:44:57.201 --> 01:44:58.970
<v Speaker 2>which is the poorest states like </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kentucky,</v>

2491
01:44:58.971 --> 01:45:00.280
<v Speaker 2>Kentucky maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

2492
01:45:00.390 --> 01:45:02.210
<v Speaker 2>it's half of half of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2493
01:45:02.210 --> 01:45:05.330
<v Speaker 2>But now you've got a minimum wage that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same as Kentucky,</v>

2494
01:45:05.630 --> 01:45:09.500
<v Speaker 2>so it is basically keeping a lot more </v>
<v Speaker 2>people unemployed.</v>

2495
01:45:09.650 --> 01:45:11.450
<v Speaker 2>But then you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you still have welfare,</v>

2496
01:45:11.451 --> 01:45:13.550
<v Speaker 2>you still have food stamps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you have all these people.</v>

2497
01:45:13.551 --> 01:45:16.820
<v Speaker 2>Now that are not working because they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting paid by the government,</v>

2498
01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:18.740
<v Speaker 2>but then you have the Puerto Rican </v>
<v Speaker 2>government,</v>

2499
01:45:18.741 --> 01:45:23.741
<v Speaker 2>which is a major employer of gay people </v>
<v Speaker 2>work for the government and a lot of </v>

2500
01:45:23.741 --> 01:45:25.100
<v Speaker 2>them are just doing nonsense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2501
01:45:25.101 --> 01:45:28.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's so many people that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>working for the government.</v>

2502
01:45:28.520 --> 01:45:33.520
<v Speaker 2>They're not productive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're draining resources from the </v>

2503
01:45:33.520 --> 01:45:33.520
<v Speaker 2>Puerto Rican economy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2504
01:45:33.520 --> 01:45:35.110
<v Speaker 2>part of it was a power company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2505
01:45:35.150 --> 01:45:37.940
<v Speaker 2>you mean it's a disaster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the government is running everything</v>

2506
01:45:37.941 --> 01:45:42.941
<v Speaker 2>there and so everything is inefficient </v>
<v Speaker 2>and meanwhile a lot of the productive </v>

2507
01:45:42.941 --> 01:45:47.591
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who want jobs have left the </v>

2508
01:45:47.591 --> 01:45:47.591
<v Speaker 2>island.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you think a high minimum wages,</v>

2509
01:45:47.591 --> 01:45:47.591
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>

2510
01:45:47.630 --> 01:45:52.070
<v Speaker 2>All the people who are leaving Puerto </v>
<v Speaker 2>Rico to go to Florida are effectively,</v>

2511
01:45:52.071 --> 01:45:57.071
<v Speaker 2>even though it's the same minimum wage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're actually going to a state that </v>

2512
01:45:57.071 --> 01:46:00.011
<v Speaker 2>has a much lower minimum wage relative </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the medium wage because they can get </v>

2513
01:46:00.011 --> 01:46:03.230
<v Speaker 2>jobs in Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can't get them in in Puerto Rico.</v>

2514
01:46:03.590 --> 01:46:08.590
<v Speaker 2>So you have that situation where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know very few people are actually </v>

2515
01:46:08.590 --> 01:46:09.560
<v Speaker 2>employees so you don't have a real tax </v>
<v Speaker 2>space.</v>

2516
01:46:09.920 --> 01:46:14.920
<v Speaker 2>And then what America did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but really screwed them over was we made</v>

2517
01:46:15.021 --> 01:46:17.960
<v Speaker 2>all their bonds triple tax free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We said,</v>

2518
01:46:17.961 --> 01:46:22.961
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you live in New York and you buy </v>

2519
01:46:22.961 --> 01:46:25.520
<v Speaker 2>Puerto Rican government bonds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to pay any local income</v>

2520
01:46:25.521 --> 01:46:30.521
<v Speaker 2>taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to pay any federal </v>

2521
01:46:30.521 --> 01:46:30.521
<v Speaker 2>income taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all tax free.</v>

2522
01:46:30.521 --> 01:46:32.450
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you loan money to a poor Puerto Rican</v>

2523
01:46:32.451 --> 01:46:33.830
<v Speaker 2>company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2524
01:46:33.831 --> 01:46:36.140
<v Speaker 2>If you loan money to a private business </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Puerto Rico,</v>

2525
01:46:36.141 --> 01:46:38.510
<v Speaker 2>you got to pay taxes on whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They pay you an interest.</v>

2526
01:46:38.690 --> 01:46:40.790
<v Speaker 2>But if you loan money to the Puerto </v>
<v Speaker 2>Rican government,</v>

2527
01:46:41.060 --> 01:46:46.060
<v Speaker 2>the interest is tax free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So America subsidized invest in loaning </v>

2528
01:46:46.060 --> 01:46:48.890
<v Speaker 2>money to the government in Puerto Rico,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not to the private.</v>

2529
01:46:49.620 --> 01:46:50.010
<v Speaker 2>And so they</v>

2530
01:46:50.010 --> 01:46:55.010
<v Speaker 3>made it very easy for Puerto Rican </v>
<v Speaker 3>politicians to go into debt because all </v>

2531
01:46:55.010 --> 01:46:59.271
<v Speaker 3>these Muni bond funds all over the </v>
<v Speaker 3>country needed Puerto Rican paper to </v>

2532
01:46:59.271 --> 01:47:01.800
<v Speaker 3>increase the yield on their fund.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you have everybody wants Puerto Rican</v>

2533
01:47:01.801 --> 01:47:06.801
<v Speaker 3>government bonds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the Puerto Rican government is </v>

2534
01:47:06.801 --> 01:47:06.801
<v Speaker 3>creating these bonds and they can now </v>
<v Speaker 3>buy votes.</v>

2535
01:47:06.801 --> 01:47:09.540
<v Speaker 3>They can promise all sorts of goodies to</v>
<v Speaker 3>people who vote for them.</v>

2536
01:47:09.630 --> 01:47:12.510
<v Speaker 3>They can overpay government workers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>give them all sorts of holidays,</v>

2537
01:47:12.511 --> 01:47:17.511
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lots of time off and they can keep </v>

2538
01:47:17.511 --> 01:47:19.450
<v Speaker 3>borrowing money so they got deeper and </v>
<v Speaker 3>deeper into debt because we created a,</v>

2539
01:47:19.520 --> 01:47:24.520
<v Speaker 3>an incentive for them to do that and and</v>
<v Speaker 3>now they have a debt crisis because all </v>

2540
01:47:24.520 --> 01:47:29.211
<v Speaker 3>of a sudden Puerto Rican bondholders </v>
<v Speaker 3>realize that Puerto Rico is never going </v>

2541
01:47:29.211 --> 01:47:32.801
<v Speaker 3>to pay back their money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the other thing that we did to </v>

2542
01:47:32.801 --> 01:47:34.230
<v Speaker 3>them and I talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think on the show is the Jones Act,</v>

2543
01:47:34.470 --> 01:47:39.470
<v Speaker 3>which if you remember trump suspended it</v>
<v Speaker 3>for like a week or two after Maria,</v>

2544
01:47:40.110 --> 01:47:43.260
<v Speaker 3>but the Jones act should be completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>repealed.</v>

2545
01:47:43.260 --> 01:47:45.830
<v Speaker 3>And especially if donald trump's going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be talking about,</v>

2546
01:47:46.770 --> 01:47:49.020
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a number of aspects of it,</v>

2547
01:47:49.021 --> 01:47:54.021
<v Speaker 3>but the most significant to Puerto Rico </v>
<v Speaker 3>is that the Jones Act says that if you </v>

2548
01:47:56.191 --> 01:48:00.930
<v Speaker 3>want to transport goods from one US port</v>
<v Speaker 3>to another us port,</v>

2549
01:48:01.530 --> 01:48:03.870
<v Speaker 3>it has to be an American ship,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2550
01:48:03.960 --> 01:48:06.210
<v Speaker 3>So trump is out there talking about free</v>
<v Speaker 3>trade.</v>

2551
01:48:06.240 --> 01:48:11.240
<v Speaker 3>We need free trade.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Jones Act is the opposite of free </v>

2552
01:48:11.240 --> 01:48:11.310
<v Speaker 3>trade.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's complete protectionism.</v>

2553
01:48:11.460 --> 01:48:14.790
<v Speaker 3>It's saying that if you want to take </v>
<v Speaker 3>something from Florida,</v>

2554
01:48:15.390 --> 01:48:16.210
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

2555
01:48:16.250 --> 01:48:17.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you want to take something,</v>

2556
01:48:17.560 --> 01:48:22.560
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you want to take something a between </v>

2557
01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:23.700
<v Speaker 3>the US and Puerto Rico,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got to use a US ship.</v>

2558
01:48:23.701 --> 01:48:25.110
<v Speaker 3>You can't use a foreign ship,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2559
01:48:25.111 --> 01:48:30.111
<v Speaker 3>So there's no competition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what this has done is this has </v>

2560
01:48:30.111 --> 01:48:30.900
<v Speaker 3>dramatically increased the cost of </v>
<v Speaker 3>living.</v>

2561
01:48:30.901 --> 01:48:35.901
<v Speaker 3>So even though the average person in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Puerto Rico earns half of what the </v>

2562
01:48:35.901 --> 01:48:39.351
<v Speaker 3>average person in Kentucky earns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>groceries in Puerto Rico are more </v>

2563
01:48:39.351 --> 01:48:39.420
<v Speaker 3>expensive than groceries in Kentucky.</v>

2564
01:48:39.990 --> 01:48:44.990
<v Speaker 3>So you have lower income but a higher </v>
<v Speaker 3>cost of living that's thanks to the </v>

2565
01:48:44.990 --> 01:48:47.100
<v Speaker 3>Jones Act.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if they repealed the Jones Act,</v>

2566
01:48:47.220 --> 01:48:49.080
<v Speaker 3>the cost of living in Puerto Rico and </v>
<v Speaker 3>punch.</v>

2567
01:48:49.081 --> 01:48:51.420
<v Speaker 3>And that's one of the reasons too that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the tourism industry,</v>

2568
01:48:51.630 --> 01:48:53.850
<v Speaker 3>Puerto Rico is a beautiful island.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2569
01:48:53.851 --> 01:48:55.800
<v Speaker 3>if you haven't been there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should come.</v>

2570
01:48:55.830 --> 01:48:57.150
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a magnificent island.</v>

2571
01:48:57.240 --> 01:49:00.780
<v Speaker 3>And what's also great about it is it has</v>
<v Speaker 3>a real culture as a real vibe to it.</v>

2572
01:49:00.781 --> 01:49:01.830
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a city.</v>

2573
01:49:01.831 --> 01:49:04.620
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's a Latin American city on </v>
<v Speaker 3>an island.</v>

2574
01:49:04.920 --> 01:49:06.630
<v Speaker 3>It's not just like a remote little </v>
<v Speaker 3>island,</v>

2575
01:49:06.631 --> 01:49:09.930
<v Speaker 3>so it's a really nice place to be and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's one of the only places that I think</v>

2576
01:49:09.931 --> 01:49:12.010
<v Speaker 3>you can really live in the Caribbean </v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2577
01:49:12.070 --> 01:49:13.590
<v Speaker 3>and not feel like you're just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2578
01:49:13.940 --> 01:49:15.660
<v Speaker 3>on Gilligan's island or not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just,</v>

2579
01:49:15.661 --> 01:49:17.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like on vacation all the time.</v>

2580
01:49:17.400 --> 01:49:20.010
<v Speaker 3>It's a real city with real stuff going </v>
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

2581
01:49:20.340 --> 01:49:22.140
<v Speaker 3>And I've been there now long enough </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2582
01:49:22.600 --> 01:49:23.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2583
01:49:23.430 --> 01:49:24.630
<v Speaker 3>I would go there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2584
01:49:24.631 --> 01:49:27.210
<v Speaker 3>you even without the tax breaks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like being there.</v>

2585
01:49:27.270 --> 01:49:32.270
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I look forward to going about crime and </v>

2586
01:49:32.270 --> 01:49:34.821
<v Speaker 3>poverty and there's crime there in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>big city in San Juan and certain areas </v>

2587
01:49:34.821 --> 01:49:37.920
<v Speaker 3>just like there are in New York and just</v>
<v Speaker 3>like all major US cities.</v>

2588
01:49:37.921 --> 01:49:40.500
<v Speaker 3>You've got crime problems and again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's there.</v>

2589
01:49:40.620 --> 01:49:42.870
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of reasons for that.</v>

2590
01:49:42.871 --> 01:49:44.430
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has to do with government,</v>

2591
01:49:44.431 --> 01:49:46.680
<v Speaker 3>it has to do with the drug laws and all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the other things.</v>

2592
01:49:46.681 --> 01:49:48.370
<v Speaker 3>Although they medical marijuana</v>

2593
01:49:48.940 --> 01:49:50.200
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Puerto Rico,</v>

2594
01:49:50.201 --> 01:49:52.240
<v Speaker 2>I think eventually they'll probably have</v>
<v Speaker 2>recreational,</v>

2595
01:49:52.241 --> 01:49:54.400
<v Speaker 2>but at least they have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have medical.</v>

2596
01:49:54.970 --> 01:49:56.470
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was I,</v>

2597
01:49:56.530 --> 01:49:58.150
<v Speaker 2>what was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just lost my train of thought.</v>

2598
01:49:58.480 --> 01:50:00.790
<v Speaker 2>What was I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we're talking about.</v>

2599
01:50:00.850 --> 01:50:02.120
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Jones Act Jones Act,</v>

2600
01:50:02.500 --> 01:50:03.640
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so.</v>

2601
01:50:03.641 --> 01:50:05.560
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how it hurts the tourism industry.</v>

2602
01:50:05.561 --> 01:50:10.120
<v Speaker 2>So the Jones Act makes a Puerto Rican </v>
<v Speaker 2>hotels,</v>

2603
01:50:10.530 --> 01:50:11.400
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2604
01:50:11.800 --> 01:50:16.800
<v Speaker 2>unable to compete on the low end with </v>
<v Speaker 2>hotels and other Caribbean islands </v>

2605
01:50:16.800 --> 01:50:21.150
<v Speaker 2>because everything is so expensive </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of the Jones Act and because </v>

2606
01:50:21.150 --> 01:50:22.660
<v Speaker 2>they have the US minimum wage </v>
<v Speaker 2>specifically is the Jones Act.</v>

2607
01:50:22.840 --> 01:50:23.460
<v Speaker 2>How does it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does it,</v>

2608
01:50:23.550 --> 01:50:25.900
<v Speaker 2>it's on the shipping imports,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2609
01:50:25.901 --> 01:50:28.450
<v Speaker 2>So all the food in Puerto Rico is more </v>
<v Speaker 2>expensive.</v>

2610
01:50:28.600 --> 01:50:31.360
<v Speaker 2>All the supply.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So hotels have a lot of things.</v>

2611
01:50:31.361 --> 01:50:33.990
<v Speaker 2>Were you going to a hotel?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's all kinds of products.</v>

2612
01:50:33.991 --> 01:50:37.810
<v Speaker 2>You got bath products in there has to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>shipped and all the food that you eat,</v>

2613
01:50:37.811 --> 01:50:39.610
<v Speaker 2>all the drinks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all this stuff is shipped in.</v>

2614
01:50:39.820 --> 01:50:44.820
<v Speaker 2>And to bring it to Puerto Rico is a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>more expensive than the bring it to the </v>

2615
01:50:44.820 --> 01:50:47.950
<v Speaker 2>Bahamas or bring it to Barbados or </v>
<v Speaker 2>someplace else.</v>

2616
01:50:47.951 --> 01:50:52.951
<v Speaker 2>So all these other Caribbean islands can</v>
<v Speaker 2>get a lot of American tourists to go </v>

2617
01:50:52.951 --> 01:50:54.580
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On for bargain vacations,</v>

2618
01:50:54.730 --> 01:50:57.160
<v Speaker 2>but Puerto Rico can't compete on the low</v>
<v Speaker 2>end,</v>

2619
01:50:57.370 --> 01:50:58.610
<v Speaker 2>on the real high end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2620
01:50:58.660 --> 01:51:02.440
<v Speaker 2>they can compete because their people </v>
<v Speaker 2>are not as concerned about the cost.</v>

2621
01:51:02.680 --> 01:51:04.840
<v Speaker 2>But on the lower end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the budget traveler,</v>

2622
01:51:05.170 --> 01:51:10.170
<v Speaker 2>a lot more people would be going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Puerto Rico if it wasn't for the Jones </v>

2623
01:51:10.170 --> 01:51:12.730
<v Speaker 2>Act because they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hotels would be able to cater to,</v>

2624
01:51:12.990 --> 01:51:17.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lower price point because they could </v>

2625
01:51:17.990 --> 01:51:17.990
<v Speaker 2>hire the chamber maid for less money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They could,</v>

2626
01:51:17.990 --> 01:51:19.800
<v Speaker 2>they could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they could have lower prices at,</v>

2627
01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:23.920
<v Speaker 2>at the restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is really destroying the tourism</v>

2628
01:51:23.921 --> 01:51:26.620
<v Speaker 2>industry in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Puerto Rico,</v>

2629
01:51:26.621 --> 01:51:28.570
<v Speaker 2>which could be thriving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2630
01:51:28.571 --> 01:51:33.571
<v Speaker 2>but for the Jones Act,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also it is diminishing the standard </v>

2631
01:51:33.571 --> 01:51:36.020
<v Speaker 2>of living of Puerto Rican who are forced</v>
<v Speaker 2>to pay higher prices.</v>

2632
01:51:36.020 --> 01:51:36.350
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>

2633
01:51:36.370 --> 01:51:41.370
<v Speaker 2>what happens is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say there's a big ship coming in </v>

2634
01:51:41.370 --> 01:51:43.060
<v Speaker 2>from China with all sorts of goods and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's gonna.</v>

2635
01:51:43.061 --> 01:51:43.400
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2636
01:51:43.570 --> 01:51:48.370
<v Speaker 2>it's headed for a US port.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it could stop off at Puerto Rico,</v>

2637
01:51:48.490 --> 01:51:51.310
<v Speaker 2>drop a few things off and then continue </v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

2638
01:51:51.660 --> 01:51:52.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>its destination.</v>

2639
01:51:53.290 --> 01:51:55.700
<v Speaker 2>That would be great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be inexpensive for,</v>

2640
01:51:55.740 --> 01:51:58.030
<v Speaker 2>they can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What it has to do is it has to bring all</v>

2641
01:51:58.031 --> 01:52:03.031
<v Speaker 2>this stuff that's going to Puerto Rico </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the u s unloaded and then load it </v>

2642
01:52:03.031 --> 01:52:05.500
<v Speaker 2>back on a US flag ship and then send it </v>
<v Speaker 2>back to Puerto Rico,</v>

2643
01:52:05.890 --> 01:52:10.890
<v Speaker 2>which costs a fortune.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the same thing with Puerto </v>

2644
01:52:10.890 --> 01:52:10.890
<v Speaker 2>Rican exports.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So their whole.</v>

2645
01:52:10.890 --> 01:52:15.750
<v Speaker 2>The whole Puerto Rican international </v>
<v Speaker 2>commerce is being limited by the Jones </v>

2646
01:52:16.990 --> 01:52:18.490
<v Speaker 2>Act.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now this also affects Hawaii.</v>

2647
01:52:18.610 --> 01:52:23.610
<v Speaker 2>Hawaii suffers from the Jones Act two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Hawaii is much richer than Puerto </v>

2648
01:52:23.610 --> 01:52:27.840
<v Speaker 2>Rico.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have a much higher average income </v>

2649
01:52:27.840 --> 01:52:27.840
<v Speaker 2>and so even though it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2650
01:52:27.840 --> 01:52:29.140
<v Speaker 2>it affects them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not as.</v>

2651
01:52:29.170 --> 01:52:34.170
<v Speaker 2>It's not as big a deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the same thing with Hawaii even </v>

2652
01:52:34.170 --> 01:52:34.170
<v Speaker 2>though Hawaii is a state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2653
01:52:34.170 --> 01:52:35.920
<v Speaker 2>Because yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because Hawaii is a US port,</v>

2654
01:52:36.100 --> 01:52:41.100
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hawaii has to have all these Jones act </v>

2655
01:52:41.100 --> 01:52:41.530
<v Speaker 2>ships as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so the.</v>

2656
01:52:41.540 --> 01:52:46.540
<v Speaker 2>If something gets delivered to Hawaii,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has to get delivered to somewhere </v>

2657
01:52:46.540 --> 01:52:46.540
<v Speaker 2>first and then shipped</v>

2658
01:52:46.540 --> 01:52:48.620
<v Speaker 3>to Hawaii to go to California.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For us,</v>

2659
01:52:48.650 --> 01:52:51.920
<v Speaker 3>most stuff that's going to Hawaii,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this coming from the Pacific,</v>

2660
01:52:52.610 --> 01:52:54.440
<v Speaker 3>they don't stop off at Hawaii.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They made.</v>

2661
01:52:54.520 --> 01:52:58.160
<v Speaker 4>Seems so crazy of Hawaii is actually a </v>
<v Speaker 4>state like Puerto Rican.</v>

2662
01:52:58.280 --> 01:53:00.020
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because that was a strange thing.</v>

2663
01:53:00.021 --> 01:53:01.370
<v Speaker 4>It's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a territory,</v>

2664
01:53:01.380 --> 01:53:01.710
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2665
01:53:01.950 --> 01:53:03.880
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the best thing that Puerto Rico's</v>

2666
01:53:03.900 --> 01:53:05.970
<v Speaker 3>got going for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it was a state,</v>

2667
01:53:06.060 --> 01:53:09.360
<v Speaker 3>they'd have to pay the state income tax.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'd have to pay the obamacare tax,</v>

2668
01:53:09.510 --> 01:53:12.840
<v Speaker 3>they'd have to pay the federal gas tax.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're exempt from all that stuff,</v>

2669
01:53:13.080 --> 01:53:18.080
<v Speaker 3>but the Jones Act has to do with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't take a ship between two US </v>

2670
01:53:18.641 --> 01:53:19.560
<v Speaker 3>ports.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have.</v>

2671
01:53:19.580 --> 01:53:21.630
<v Speaker 3>It has to be a foreign port to a US </v>
<v Speaker 3>port,</v>

2672
01:53:21.870 --> 01:53:24.480
<v Speaker 3>so Puerto Rico is not considered a </v>
<v Speaker 3>foreign port.</v>

2673
01:53:24.930 --> 01:53:29.930
<v Speaker 3>It's a domestic port.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hawaii of course is the mess they pick </v>

2674
01:53:29.930 --> 01:53:32.791
<v Speaker 3>us for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is the state and so Hawaii things </v>

2675
01:53:32.791 --> 01:53:35.991
<v Speaker 3>are very expensive in Hawaii for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same reason that they're expensive in </v>

2676
01:53:35.991 --> 01:53:37.560
<v Speaker 3>Puerto Rico,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Hawaiians can afford it more because</v>

2677
01:53:37.561 --> 01:53:42.561
<v Speaker 3>Hawaiians on average have more money and</v>
<v Speaker 3>so if your average income is higher than</v>

2678
01:53:43.040 --> 01:53:43.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

2679
01:53:43.610 --> 01:53:48.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your food budget is not as important to </v>

2680
01:53:48.610 --> 01:53:48.610
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

2681
01:53:48.610 --> 01:53:51.050
<v Speaker 3>So if we got rid of the Jones Act,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be a big benefit for Puerto </v>

2682
01:53:51.050 --> 01:53:51.050
<v Speaker 3>Rico.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

2683
01:53:51.050 --> 01:53:55.161
<v Speaker 3>the worst thing that can happen to </v>
<v Speaker 3>Puerto Rico is it becomes a state and I </v>

2684
01:53:55.161 --> 01:53:58.371
<v Speaker 3>get tired of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I keep hearing these politicians say </v>

2685
01:53:58.371 --> 01:54:00.210
<v Speaker 3>Puerto Rico needs to be a state and all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the problems will be solved.</v>

2686
01:54:00.630 --> 01:54:05.630
<v Speaker 3>Their problems will go through the roof.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only thing that will happen if </v>

2687
01:54:05.630 --> 01:54:08.700
<v Speaker 3>Puerto Rico becomes a state is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>welfare checks will get bigger to people</v>

2688
01:54:08.701 --> 01:54:13.701
<v Speaker 3>in Puerto Rico,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's the last thing they need is </v>

2689
01:54:13.701 --> 01:54:13.701
<v Speaker 3>more welfare.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They need more freedom.</v>

2690
01:54:13.701 --> 01:54:18.501
<v Speaker 3>They need more opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They need more free enterprise and all </v>

2691
01:54:18.501 --> 01:54:18.960
<v Speaker 3>that will go away if they become a </v>
<v Speaker 3>state.</v>

2692
01:54:19.080 --> 01:54:24.080
<v Speaker 3>Because if you imagine all the problems </v>
<v Speaker 3>a Puerto Rican has now imagine leveling </v>

2693
01:54:24.080 --> 01:54:27.570
<v Speaker 3>the income tax on top of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine sending the irs to Puerto Rico.</v>

2694
01:54:27.600 --> 01:54:28.860
<v Speaker 3>They've mapped their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not even down there.</v>

2695
01:54:28.861 --> 01:54:30.470
<v Speaker 3>Now imagine have an irs agent</v>

2696
01:54:30.690 --> 01:54:35.690
<v Speaker 4>with this real support for socialism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is there any place where socialism has </v>

2697
01:54:35.690 --> 01:54:40.191
<v Speaker 4>worked where there's like some extreme </v>
<v Speaker 4>benefits to the people that lived there </v>

2698
01:54:40.191 --> 01:54:41.850
<v Speaker 4>where they can show you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because there are guys like you,</v>

2699
01:54:41.851 --> 01:54:44.310
<v Speaker 4>the free market capitalist guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're always saying like,</v>

2700
01:54:44.490 --> 01:54:46.320
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is the solution.</v>

2701
01:54:46.620 --> 01:54:48.510
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>capitalism is solution.</v>

2702
01:54:48.511 --> 01:54:51.030
<v Speaker 4>Give people freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Solution deregulation.</v>

2703
01:54:51.180 --> 01:54:53.640
<v Speaker 4>That's the solution.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let businesses thrive.</v>

2704
01:54:53.670 --> 01:54:56.400
<v Speaker 4>More people to make money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Businesses will grow.</v>

2705
01:54:56.430 --> 01:54:57.950
<v Speaker 4>People have more opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2706
01:54:57.950 --> 01:55:00.500
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people think it's worked in Scandinavia.</v>

2707
01:55:00.501 --> 01:55:03.140
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they always want to talk about Sweden as</v>

2708
01:55:03.141 --> 01:55:05.780
<v Speaker 3>an example of where socialism works </v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2709
01:55:05.781 --> 01:55:07.190
<v Speaker 3>poc to a suite,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2710
01:55:07.310 --> 01:55:09.020
<v Speaker 3>And they'll tell you that it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>work,</v>

2711
01:55:09.021 --> 01:55:11.600
<v Speaker 3>but if you want to look at the history </v>
<v Speaker 3>of Swedish socialism,</v>

2712
01:55:11.870 --> 01:55:16.870
<v Speaker 3>Sweden became a very wealthy country </v>
<v Speaker 3>before they had that socialism,</v>

2713
01:55:17.541 --> 01:55:22.541
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were very much of a free market </v>

2714
01:55:22.541 --> 01:55:23.180
<v Speaker 3>economy and it was the freedom that </v>
<v Speaker 3>produced all the wealth,</v>

2715
01:55:23.360 --> 01:55:25.610
<v Speaker 3>but then whenever you have wealth and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you have freedom,</v>

2716
01:55:25.611 --> 01:55:27.260
<v Speaker 3>you're always going to have any quality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2717
01:55:27.261 --> 01:55:29.660
<v Speaker 3>Because people are smarter than other </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

2718
01:55:29.661 --> 01:55:31.250
<v Speaker 3>more ambitious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>harder working.</v>

2719
01:55:31.430 --> 01:55:36.430
<v Speaker 3>So whenever you have freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to have equality and </v>

2720
01:55:36.430 --> 01:55:40.061
<v Speaker 3>outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even if everybody has an equal </v>

2721
01:55:40.061 --> 01:55:40.370
<v Speaker 3>opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And of course even that's not true,</v>

2722
01:55:40.371 --> 01:55:41.400
<v Speaker 3>equal opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every.</v>

2723
01:55:41.440 --> 01:55:43.980
<v Speaker 3>Everybody is equal in the eyes of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's always going to be</v>

2724
01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:45.990
<v Speaker 2>some people that will have an advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2725
01:55:45.991 --> 01:55:49.730
<v Speaker 2>maybe they have better connections.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were born to parents that are,</v>

2726
01:55:49.770 --> 01:55:51.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have more money and they can give them,</v>

2727
01:55:51.540 --> 01:55:52.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give them a leg up.</v>

2728
01:55:53.400 --> 01:55:56.070
<v Speaker 2>So you're always gonna have unequal </v>
<v Speaker 2>outcomes.</v>

2729
01:55:56.071 --> 01:55:58.410
<v Speaker 2>Some people are going to be rich </v>
<v Speaker 2>relative to other people,</v>

2730
01:55:58.411 --> 01:56:03.411
<v Speaker 2>but the beauty of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of capitalism is that everybody is </v>

2731
01:56:03.411 --> 01:56:04.650
<v Speaker 2>better off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you end up with socialism,</v>

2732
01:56:04.780 --> 01:56:06.450
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you equalize everybody,</v>

2733
01:56:06.451 --> 01:56:09.570
<v Speaker 2>but you equalize them at a lower level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You redistribute the poverty,</v>

2734
01:56:09.690 --> 01:56:13.140
<v Speaker 2>the people who end up wealthy or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who have political connections.</v>

2735
01:56:13.141 --> 01:56:15.700
<v Speaker 2>So the wealthy people in socialist </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries are,</v>

2736
01:56:15.790 --> 01:56:20.790
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are the people who have political </v>

2737
01:56:20.790 --> 01:56:20.790
<v Speaker 2>connections.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happened with Sweden?</v>

2738
01:56:20.790 --> 01:56:20.790
<v Speaker 2>So let me go up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2739
01:56:20.790 --> 01:56:24.501
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go back to Sweden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Sweden was very rich and then of </v>

2740
01:56:24.501 --> 01:56:27.561
<v Speaker 2>course you have the demographics to </v>
<v Speaker 2>politicians who will get votes by </v>

2741
01:56:27.561 --> 01:56:28.590
<v Speaker 2>appealing to envy.</v>

2742
01:56:28.800 --> 01:56:30.780
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy has more than you.</v>

2743
01:56:31.140 --> 01:56:33.540
<v Speaker 2>It's not fair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course,</v>

2744
01:56:33.541 --> 01:56:36.000
<v Speaker 2>politicians always promised something </v>
<v Speaker 2>for nothing,</v>

2745
01:56:36.120 --> 01:56:41.120
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vote for me and I'll give you this that </v>

2746
01:56:41.120 --> 01:56:41.120
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to work for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2747
01:56:41.120 --> 01:56:42.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean that is the problem with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>democracy.</v>

2748
01:56:42.211 --> 01:56:44.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people vote for crazy things.</v>

2749
01:56:44.220 --> 01:56:47.490
<v Speaker 2>That's why the founding fathers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they created America,</v>

2750
01:56:47.520 --> 01:56:49.320
<v Speaker 2>they created a republic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2751
01:56:49.321 --> 01:56:54.321
<v Speaker 2>People don't understand the distinction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're not supposed to be a </v>

2752
01:56:54.321 --> 01:56:57.441
<v Speaker 2>democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The word democracy does not appear in </v>

2753
01:56:57.441 --> 01:56:57.700
<v Speaker 2>the constitution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does not appear in the,</v>

2754
01:56:57.780 --> 01:57:00.210
<v Speaker 2>in the declaration of independence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2755
01:57:00.310 --> 01:57:05.310
<v Speaker 2>just read the pledge of allegiance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I pledge allegiance to the flag of </v>

2756
01:57:05.310 --> 01:57:05.430
<v Speaker 2>United States of America and to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>republic,</v>

2757
01:57:05.490 --> 01:57:06.420
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're a republic.</v>

2758
01:57:06.421 --> 01:57:11.421
<v Speaker 2>We're not a democracy because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>founding fathers knew the dangers of </v>

2759
01:57:11.421 --> 01:57:11.421
<v Speaker 2>democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2760
01:57:11.421 --> 01:57:16.101
<v Speaker 2>democracy is what brought socialism into</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sweden and it's screwed them up.</v>

2761
01:57:16.680 --> 01:57:21.680
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It screwed the economy up so much that </v>

2762
01:57:21.680 --> 01:57:22.680
<v Speaker 2>in the last 10 years they've gone the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other way in.</v>

2763
01:57:22.800 --> 01:57:27.800
<v Speaker 2>They've lowered income taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've abolish the inheritance tax in </v>

2764
01:57:27.800 --> 01:57:27.870
<v Speaker 2>Sweden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2765
01:57:28.060 --> 01:57:29.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they got rid of,</v>

2766
01:57:29.221 --> 01:57:31.350
<v Speaker 2>does that sound socialists the last 10 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years?</v>

2767
01:57:31.351 --> 01:57:33.840
<v Speaker 2>So previous to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>socialism had a stronghold.</v>

2768
01:57:33.870 --> 01:57:34.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>

2769
01:57:34.520 --> 01:57:36.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it was getting bigger and bigger,</v>

2770
01:57:36.541 --> 01:57:38.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably going from the seventies,</v>

2771
01:57:38.311 --> 01:57:38.870
<v Speaker 2>eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2772
01:57:38.920 --> 01:57:42.600
<v Speaker 2>the sweetest mixed economy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like it bankrupted New Zealand.</v>

2773
01:57:42.630 --> 01:57:47.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean New Zealand used to be the poster</v>
<v Speaker 2>boy for mixed economy socialism until </v>

2774
01:57:47.630 --> 01:57:48.600
<v Speaker 2>they got bankrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

2775
01:57:48.601 --> 01:57:51.210
<v Speaker 2>And then is the only successful?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2776
01:57:51.300 --> 01:57:52.590
<v Speaker 2>they're not sick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Know,</v>

2777
01:57:52.591 --> 01:57:57.591
<v Speaker 2>but we're just going to say that that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>the only example that someone can say </v>

2778
01:57:57.591 --> 01:58:00.570
<v Speaker 2>they'll cite Norway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the Scandinavian countries,</v>

2779
01:58:00.571 --> 01:58:05.571
<v Speaker 2>Denmark,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have to look at how successful </v>

2780
01:58:05.571 --> 01:58:05.850
<v Speaker 2>they were before they became socialist.</v>

2781
01:58:05.970 --> 01:58:10.970
<v Speaker 2>And then you also have to look at what </v>
<v Speaker 2>the government is doing there because </v>

2782
01:58:10.970 --> 01:58:14.960
<v Speaker 2>the taxes on business are not extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The taxes are on the average guy.</v>

2783
01:58:16.381 --> 01:58:17.670
<v Speaker 2>They have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in Sweden,</v>

2784
01:58:18.090 --> 01:58:19.170
<v Speaker 2>I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2785
01:58:19.500 --> 01:58:22.380
<v Speaker 2>the VAT is about 30 percent sales tax </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you have to pay.</v>

2786
01:58:22.710 --> 01:58:27.710
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is a high sales tax and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>income taxes impact average people.</v>

2787
01:58:27.991 --> 01:58:32.991
<v Speaker 2>So because they know the Swedes know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they really jack up taxes on </v>

2788
01:58:32.991 --> 01:58:37.131
<v Speaker 2>businesses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the businesses will just leave and </v>

2789
01:58:37.131 --> 01:58:39.771
<v Speaker 2>they'll destroy their economy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So at least they're trying to </v>

2790
01:58:39.771 --> 01:58:40.650
<v Speaker 2>redistribute the wealth from the middle </v>
<v Speaker 2>class to the middle class,</v>

2791
01:58:40.651 --> 01:58:41.700
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>

2792
01:58:41.701 --> 01:58:43.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this stuff doesn't work and you create a</v>

2793
01:58:43.961 --> 01:58:48.961
<v Speaker 2>generations of people who now don't want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to work who just want to live off of </v>

2794
01:58:48.961 --> 01:58:49.900
<v Speaker 2>other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You destroy the initiatives,</v>

2795
01:58:49.901 --> 01:58:54.901
<v Speaker 2>you destroy the incentives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the success that Sweden enjoyed </v>

2796
01:58:54.901 --> 01:58:56.920
<v Speaker 2>is a byproduct of freedom and </v>
<v Speaker 2>capitalism.</v>

2797
01:58:57.160 --> 01:59:01.450
<v Speaker 2>And since they moved in that direction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have slowed down that progress.</v>

2798
01:59:01.810 --> 01:59:06.810
<v Speaker 2>But the Swedish people have recognized </v>
<v Speaker 2>that and that's why the reforms that </v>

2799
01:59:06.810 --> 01:59:10.480
<v Speaker 2>have been made over the last decade or </v>
<v Speaker 2>two had been to turn back the clock,</v>

2800
01:59:10.660 --> 01:59:15.450
<v Speaker 2>to move away from those socialist </v>
<v Speaker 2>policies and to try to dismantle.</v>

2801
01:59:15.451 --> 01:59:17.920
<v Speaker 2>And now they haven't gone completely the</v>
<v Speaker 2>other way.</v>

2802
01:59:18.070 --> 01:59:20.680
<v Speaker 2>Just like New Zealand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean New Zealand went so far.</v>

2803
01:59:20.830 --> 01:59:25.830
<v Speaker 2>They became,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they went from like a totally socialist </v>

2804
01:59:25.830 --> 01:59:27.400
<v Speaker 2>type economy one that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2805
01:59:27.610 --> 01:59:30.250
<v Speaker 2>this was the example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you believed in socialism,</v>

2806
01:59:30.251 --> 01:59:32.820
<v Speaker 2>you would point to New Zealand as see </v>
<v Speaker 2>this shows you.</v>

2807
01:59:32.821 --> 01:59:34.060
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they went bankrupt.</v>

2808
01:59:34.061 --> 01:59:38.020
<v Speaker 2>They went through a huge economic crisis</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the eighties bank.</v>

2809
01:59:38.021 --> 01:59:41.710
<v Speaker 2>Previous to being socialists were the </v>
<v Speaker 2>successful with capitalism.</v>

2810
01:59:41.760 --> 01:59:42.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>

2811
01:59:43.540 --> 01:59:48.540
<v Speaker 2>Because if you're always socialist than </v>
<v Speaker 2>you never have any wealth to </v>

2812
01:59:48.540 --> 01:59:51.991
<v Speaker 2>redistribute it's capitalism that </v>
<v Speaker 2>creates the wealth that the socialist </v>

2813
01:59:51.991 --> 01:59:51.991
<v Speaker 2>want to redistribute.</v>

2814
01:59:51.991 --> 01:59:54.700
<v Speaker 2>So let me ask you this though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we're going to keep going around</v>

2815
01:59:54.790 --> 01:59:58.720
<v Speaker 2>in circles with this year ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>studied this for a long period of time.</v>

2816
01:59:59.200 --> 02:00:02.830
<v Speaker 2>What is it about socialism that's so </v>
<v Speaker 2>appealing to p two people?</v>

2817
02:00:02.831 --> 02:00:05.350
<v Speaker 2>If there's no examples of it being </v>
<v Speaker 2>effective?</v>

2818
02:00:05.620 --> 02:00:06.250
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2819
02:00:06.251 --> 02:00:08.140
<v Speaker 2>as I keep coming up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well again,</v>

2820
02:00:08.200 --> 02:00:11.920
<v Speaker 2>when is it a lack of education or lack </v>
<v Speaker 2>of understanding of economics?</v>

2821
02:00:12.070 --> 02:00:17.070
<v Speaker 2>Like what is it about it that keeps like</v>
<v Speaker 2>when this woman who just won and she </v>

2822
02:00:17.070 --> 02:00:21.150
<v Speaker 2>seems like a very nice person when she </v>
<v Speaker 2>talks about being a democratic socialist</v>

2823
02:00:21.151 --> 02:00:24.140
<v Speaker 2>and nobody gets fired up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And is it ignorance like.</v>

2824
02:00:24.470 --> 02:00:25.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2825
02:00:25.031 --> 02:00:30.031
<v Speaker 2>it certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a lack of understanding of </v>

2826
02:00:30.031 --> 02:00:30.280
<v Speaker 2>economics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most people don't understand it,</v>

2827
02:00:30.281 --> 02:00:35.281
<v Speaker 2>but look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there are a lot of reasons that </v>

2828
02:00:35.281 --> 02:00:36.430
<v Speaker 2>socialism is appealing to people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when they're young,</v>

2829
02:00:36.490 --> 02:00:38.980
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's an old saying that if you're not</v>

2830
02:00:39.190 --> 02:00:43.360
<v Speaker 2>a socialist or if you're not a liberal </v>
<v Speaker 2>by the time you're 21,</v>

2831
02:00:43.361 --> 02:00:44.110
<v Speaker 2>you don't have a heart.</v>

2832
02:00:44.380 --> 02:00:46.570
<v Speaker 2>If you're not a conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the time you're 28,</v>

2833
02:00:46.571 --> 02:00:47.680
<v Speaker 2>you don't have a headache.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2834
02:00:47.681 --> 02:00:50.680
<v Speaker 2>So liberals are just people that never </v>
<v Speaker 2>grew up.</v>

2835
02:00:50.740 --> 02:00:51.190
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2836
02:00:51.191 --> 02:00:51.960
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

2837
02:00:52.330 --> 02:00:54.190
<v Speaker 2>it's like they still believe in Santa </v>
<v Speaker 2>Claus.</v>

2838
02:00:54.340 --> 02:00:55.390
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

2839
02:00:55.450 --> 02:01:00.450
<v Speaker 2>you just never socialists and </v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly not necessarily liberal </v>

2840
02:01:00.450 --> 02:01:00.450
<v Speaker 2>even.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2841
02:01:00.450 --> 02:01:02.290
<v Speaker 2>even people believing in big garbage </v>
<v Speaker 2>because usually what happens is,</v>

2842
02:01:02.430 --> 02:01:03.880
<v Speaker 2>you know when you're a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2843
02:01:03.881 --> 02:01:08.881
<v Speaker 2>And when you're in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've never had a job and all this </v>

2844
02:01:08.881 --> 02:01:10.420
<v Speaker 2>stuff sounds great until you're out in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the real world paying taxes,</v>

2845
02:01:10.600 --> 02:01:12.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why it was a mistake to lower the</v>

2846
02:01:12.551 --> 02:01:16.210
<v Speaker 2>voting age down to 18.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I don't even think 21.</v>

2847
02:01:16.570 --> 02:01:21.570
<v Speaker 2>It should be higher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you think about the original voting </v>

2848
02:01:21.570 --> 02:01:22.780
<v Speaker 2>age when it was 21 100 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>150 years ago,</v>

2849
02:01:23.110 --> 02:01:28.110
<v Speaker 2>think about a guy who was 21 back in 18.</v>
<v Speaker 2>50 different person.</v>

2850
02:01:28.420 --> 02:01:33.420
<v Speaker 2>I think about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the guy probably got out of </v>

2851
02:01:33.420 --> 02:01:33.420
<v Speaker 2>school when he was 10.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He probably already has been working.</v>

2852
02:01:33.420 --> 02:01:35.590
<v Speaker 2>He has got a family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's in the real world and I know people</v>

2853
02:01:35.591 --> 02:01:36.220
<v Speaker 2>are gonna say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2854
02:01:36.221 --> 02:01:37.660
<v Speaker 2>women were in voting fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2855
02:01:37.661 --> 02:01:38.300
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>

2856
02:01:38.301 --> 02:01:39.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that.</v>

2857
02:01:39.231 --> 02:01:41.900
<v Speaker 2>How old do you think it should be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think maybe 28,</v>

2858
02:01:41.901 --> 02:01:42.350
<v Speaker 2>30.</v>

2859
02:01:44.510 --> 02:01:47.420
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2860
02:01:48.440 --> 02:01:52.520
<v Speaker 2>let me make it fit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's the reason.</v>

2861
02:01:52.730 --> 02:01:57.730
<v Speaker 2>The reason they re,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all the reasons would be 28 years </v>

2862
02:01:57.730 --> 02:01:58.250
<v Speaker 2>old enough sun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2863
02:01:58.310 --> 02:02:03.310
<v Speaker 2>the reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason they raised the voting age </v>

2864
02:02:03.310 --> 02:02:03.310
<v Speaker 2>was because of Vietnam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of the draft,</v>

2865
02:02:03.310 --> 02:02:04.580
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were saying old enough to fight old</v>

2866
02:02:04.581 --> 02:02:09.581
<v Speaker 2>enough to vote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was a bunch of lower the voting </v>

2867
02:02:09.581 --> 02:02:09.581
<v Speaker 2>age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2868
02:02:09.581 --> 02:02:09.581
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they.</v>

2869
02:02:09.581 --> 02:02:09.770
<v Speaker 2>They lowered it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2870
02:02:09.771 --> 02:02:12.590
<v Speaker 2>Because he used to get drafted when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>were 18 and they were saying,</v>

2871
02:02:12.591 --> 02:02:13.160
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2872
02:02:13.520 --> 02:02:14.720
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to drop and look,</v>

2873
02:02:14.721 --> 02:02:19.721
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe in the draft.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would rather get rid of the draft and </v>

2874
02:02:19.721 --> 02:02:21.140
<v Speaker 2>leave it with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That 21 sounds better.</v>

2875
02:02:21.141 --> 02:02:24.860
<v Speaker 2>I would say 25 because that's the age to</v>
<v Speaker 2>your frontal cortex develops,</v>

2876
02:02:25.010 --> 02:02:25.500
<v Speaker 2>but no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

2877
02:02:25.501 --> 02:02:25.800
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>

2878
02:02:25.860 --> 02:02:28.070
<v Speaker 2>what's important about voting is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>voting.</v>

2879
02:02:28.100 --> 02:02:29.810
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I moved to Puerto Rico,</v>

2880
02:02:29.811 --> 02:02:31.280
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gave up my right to vote.</v>

2881
02:02:31.280 --> 02:02:36.280
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the things I can don't </v>

2882
02:02:36.280 --> 02:02:36.280
<v Speaker 2>vote at all for president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for anything.</v>

2883
02:02:36.280 --> 02:02:36.280
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't vote for congressmen.</v>

2884
02:02:36.280 --> 02:02:40.900
<v Speaker 2>They don't have a congress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is nobody that is still a state </v>

2885
02:02:40.900 --> 02:02:41.690
<v Speaker 2>territory territory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But.</v>

2886
02:02:41.830 --> 02:02:46.830
<v Speaker 2>So if you live in Puerto Rico and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>move to Florida now you can vote for </v>

2887
02:02:46.830 --> 02:02:48.560
<v Speaker 2>congressmen in your district.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can vote for a Florida senator.</v>

2888
02:02:48.561 --> 02:02:53.330
<v Speaker 2>How much time to spend in Florida to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>officially living there?</v>

2889
02:02:53.360 --> 02:02:53.990
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2890
02:02:54.320 --> 02:02:57.560
<v Speaker 2>if you kept your place in Puerto Rico,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I wouldn't want to do that.</v>

2891
02:02:57.590 --> 02:02:58.640
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>

2892
02:02:58.641 --> 02:03:01.070
<v Speaker 2>if you're important,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're in 100,</v>

2893
02:03:01.071 --> 02:03:04.940
<v Speaker 2>83 days is the cutoff for where your </v>
<v Speaker 2>residence is going to be.</v>

2894
02:03:05.360 --> 02:03:09.560
<v Speaker 2>But the important thing about voting is </v>
<v Speaker 2>not that you get to vote.</v>

2895
02:03:10.070 --> 02:03:12.410
<v Speaker 2>The important thing is to have good </v>
<v Speaker 2>government,</v>

2896
02:03:12.500 --> 02:03:13.670
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what is good government?</v>

2897
02:03:13.671 --> 02:03:18.671
<v Speaker 2>Good government is government that </v>
<v Speaker 2>respects a private property that </v>

2898
02:03:18.671 --> 02:03:18.671
<v Speaker 2>respects that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2899
02:03:18.671 --> 02:03:19.560
<v Speaker 2>if you go back and look at.</v>

2900
02:03:19.560 --> 02:03:21.920
<v Speaker 2>I mentioned this on one of my own </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast recently,</v>

2901
02:03:22.100 --> 02:03:25.580
<v Speaker 2>I talked about the meaning of America </v>
<v Speaker 2>and what government is for in America.</v>

2902
02:03:25.581 --> 02:03:30.581
<v Speaker 2>American.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you go back to the declaration of </v>

2903
02:03:30.581 --> 02:03:30.581
<v Speaker 2>independence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just had,</v>

2904
02:03:30.581 --> 02:03:30.581
<v Speaker 2>we celebrated our independence day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2905
02:03:30.581 --> 02:03:32.630
<v Speaker 2>just a couple of weeks ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2906
02:03:32.870 --> 02:03:36.290
<v Speaker 2>but government is here to protect life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>liberty,</v>

2907
02:03:36.291 --> 02:03:41.291
<v Speaker 2>and the pursuit of happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their government is here to protect our </v>

2908
02:03:41.291 --> 02:03:41.300
<v Speaker 2>rights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not here to give us free stuff.</v>

2909
02:03:41.450 --> 02:03:44.000
<v Speaker 2>It's not here to take stuff from other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people and give it to us.</v>

2910
02:03:44.210 --> 02:03:46.310
<v Speaker 2>It's there to protect us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2911
02:03:46.311 --> 02:03:47.960
<v Speaker 2>It's there protecting life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>liberty,</v>

2912
02:03:47.961 --> 02:03:52.961
<v Speaker 2>property.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the goal of government or the </v>

2913
02:03:52.961 --> 02:03:53.000
<v Speaker 2>goal of an election is to have good </v>
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>

2914
02:03:53.240 --> 02:03:54.590
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as far as I'm concerned,</v>

2915
02:03:55.010 --> 02:04:00.010
<v Speaker 2>I would rather have good government </v>
<v Speaker 2>where I don't vote then bad government </v>

2916
02:04:00.010 --> 02:04:00.010
<v Speaker 2>where I do vote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2917
02:04:00.010 --> 02:04:01.430
<v Speaker 2>Because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that people said,</v>

2918
02:04:01.431 --> 02:04:02.930
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to move to Puerto Rico.</v>

2919
02:04:02.930 --> 02:04:04.460
<v Speaker 2>You can't vote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who Cares?</v>

2920
02:04:04.461 --> 02:04:09.461
<v Speaker 2>I voted for the loser in every election.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What difference does it make when some </v>

2921
02:04:09.461 --> 02:04:10.630
<v Speaker 2>idiots are going to outvote me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2922
02:04:10.631 --> 02:04:15.631
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's basically who's voting in </v>

2923
02:04:15.631 --> 02:04:15.631
<v Speaker 2>America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2924
02:04:15.631 --> 02:04:18.070
<v Speaker 2>if you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the elections are decided by the TV </v>

2925
02:04:18.070 --> 02:04:18.620
<v Speaker 2>commercials,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2926
02:04:18.621 --> 02:04:19.940
<v Speaker 2>Because most people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2927
02:04:19.941 --> 02:04:23.030
<v Speaker 2>they know who they're gonna vote for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you imagine the person who's,</v>

2928
02:04:23.210 --> 02:04:25.850
<v Speaker 2>who decides who's going to vote for </v>
<v Speaker 2>based on a TV commercial?</v>

2929
02:04:25.910 --> 02:04:27.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these guys are more on the swing.</v>

2930
02:04:28.070 --> 02:04:31.340
<v Speaker 2>The swing voters are determining the </v>
<v Speaker 2>outcome of these elections.</v>

2931
02:04:31.610 --> 02:04:33.440
<v Speaker 2>And we ended up with horrible </v>
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>

2932
02:04:33.441 --> 02:04:38.441
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>government democracy almost guarantees </v>

2933
02:04:38.441 --> 02:04:40.960
<v Speaker 2>horrible government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what are the things you want to do </v>

2934
02:04:40.960 --> 02:04:40.960
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to have democracy is </v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2935
02:04:40.960 --> 02:04:44.640
<v Speaker 2>let's have responsible people voting who</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand what they're voting for,</v>

2936
02:04:44.641 --> 02:04:47.070
<v Speaker 2>who have actually lived and worked in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the economy,</v>

2937
02:04:47.071 --> 02:04:49.620
<v Speaker 2>who have had a job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who have paid taxes,</v>

2938
02:04:49.680 --> 02:04:52.230
<v Speaker 2>who have run businesses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who have employed people.</v>

2939
02:04:52.290 --> 02:04:57.290
<v Speaker 2>If you've never had a job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're still living with your </v>

2940
02:04:57.290 --> 02:04:57.290
<v Speaker 2>parents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are you voting?</v>

2941
02:04:57.290 --> 02:05:01.341
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we might as well lower the voting age </v>

2942
02:05:01.341 --> 02:05:01.341
<v Speaker 2>and let people in kindergarten vote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2943
02:05:01.341 --> 02:05:04.850
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they can vote for whoever promises </v>

2944
02:05:04.850 --> 02:05:06.831
<v Speaker 2>them free toys and people so you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2945
02:05:07.111 --> 02:05:08.340
<v Speaker 2>it's unfair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

2946
02:05:08.400 --> 02:05:11.850
<v Speaker 2>if we could have good government without</v>
<v Speaker 2>18 year olds voting,</v>

2947
02:05:11.970 --> 02:05:13.260
<v Speaker 2>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2948
02:05:13.261 --> 02:05:18.261
<v Speaker 2>but the left wants the young people </v>
<v Speaker 2>voting because they're stupid enough to </v>

2949
02:05:18.261 --> 02:05:18.390
<v Speaker 2>vote for their.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2950
02:05:18.391 --> 02:05:23.391
<v Speaker 2>And you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is socialism appealing to somebody </v>

2951
02:05:23.391 --> 02:05:23.391
<v Speaker 2>who's young?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they don't know any better.</v>

2952
02:05:23.391 --> 02:05:26.690
<v Speaker 2>They haven't lived and it sounds good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2953
02:05:26.910 --> 02:05:27.600
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2954
02:05:27.690 --> 02:05:32.690
<v Speaker 2>I care about people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why liberals think conservatives </v>

2955
02:05:33.180 --> 02:05:34.570
<v Speaker 2>are mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2956
02:05:34.630 --> 02:05:39.630
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Conservatives don't think liberals are </v>

2957
02:05:39.630 --> 02:05:39.630
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just think they don't understand.</v>

2958
02:05:39.630 --> 02:05:40.620
<v Speaker 2>They're misinformed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2959
02:05:40.700 --> 02:05:41.080
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

2960
02:05:41.081 --> 02:05:41.820
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't.</v>

2961
02:05:41.821 --> 02:05:42.570
<v Speaker 2>They don't get it.</v>

2962
02:05:42.630 --> 02:05:44.610
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's sort of shifting.</v>

2963
02:05:44.880 --> 02:05:49.880
<v Speaker 2>It seems like there's more people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are thinking that liberals are mean now </v>

2964
02:05:49.880 --> 02:05:51.510
<v Speaker 2>than ever before because of the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're attacking thing.</v>

2965
02:05:51.511 --> 02:05:53.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because liberals are now so intolerant,</v>

2966
02:05:53.431 --> 02:05:55.630
<v Speaker 2>which is the craziest part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they like to pretend that there are</v>

2967
02:05:55.631 --> 02:06:00.631
<v Speaker 2>so tolerant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're the most intolerant people </v>

2968
02:06:00.631 --> 02:06:00.740
<v Speaker 2>out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Only tolerant if you agree with yes.</v>

2969
02:06:00.840 --> 02:06:05.280
<v Speaker 2>And to be tolerant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to tolerate intolerance.</v>

2970
02:06:05.520 --> 02:06:06.460
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That see,</v>

2971
02:06:06.700 --> 02:06:08.370
<v Speaker 2>when we talked earlier about </v>
<v Speaker 2>discrimination,</v>

2972
02:06:08.371 --> 02:06:10.560
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if somebody is a racist,</v>

2973
02:06:10.650 --> 02:06:12.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to tolerate that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fine.</v>

2974
02:06:12.480 --> 02:06:15.240
<v Speaker 2>You can have your own opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can disagree with your opinion,</v>

2975
02:06:15.360 --> 02:06:16.800
<v Speaker 2>but fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Live and let live.</v>

2976
02:06:16.801 --> 02:06:19.500
<v Speaker 2>I live in a free country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People can do things I don't like,</v>

2977
02:06:19.630 --> 02:06:21.270
<v Speaker 2>but to a liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't,</v>

2978
02:06:21.271 --> 02:06:23.400
<v Speaker 2>if you don't think exactly the way they </v>
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>

2979
02:06:23.700 --> 02:06:24.480
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh they,</v>

2980
02:06:24.540 --> 02:06:25.150
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

2981
02:06:25.390 --> 02:06:26.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>harass you.</v>

2982
02:06:26.580 --> 02:06:31.580
<v Speaker 2>So they're becoming evil and mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they used to just be ignorant now.</v>

2983
02:06:31.771 --> 02:06:32.470
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now they're.</v>

2984
02:06:32.550 --> 02:06:34.950
<v Speaker 2>Now they're ignorant at admin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2985
02:06:34.951 --> 02:06:37.170
<v Speaker 2>not just mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but harassing people,</v>

2986
02:06:37.171 --> 02:06:42.171
<v Speaker 2>encouraging people to harass people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>have separate political views and </v>

2987
02:06:42.171 --> 02:06:42.190
<v Speaker 2>opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

2988
02:06:42.191 --> 02:06:42.550
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2989
02:06:42.600 --> 02:06:44.730
<v Speaker 2>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very strangely.</v>

2990
02:06:44.731 --> 02:06:49.731
<v Speaker 2>Anybody who supports the trump </v>
<v Speaker 2>administration or is even a part of it </v>

2991
02:06:49.930 --> 02:06:52.520
<v Speaker 2>is people to get harassed at restaurants</v>
<v Speaker 2>and.</v>

2992
02:06:52.830 --> 02:06:53.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

2993
02:06:53.431 --> 02:06:55.860
<v Speaker 2>I wish I could be a bigger supporter of </v>
<v Speaker 2>trump.</v>

2994
02:06:55.861 --> 02:06:57.080
<v Speaker 2>I mean I voted for him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2995
02:06:57.081 --> 02:07:02.081
<v Speaker 2>I really liked trump as a candidate a </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he was saying a lot of the same </v>

2996
02:07:02.081 --> 02:07:02.820
<v Speaker 2>things I was saying when he was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>candidate.</v>

2997
02:07:02.940 --> 02:07:07.940
<v Speaker 2>It's just at the minute he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well about the phony economy and you </v>

2998
02:07:07.940 --> 02:07:07.950
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how we have to,</v>

2999
02:07:08.100 --> 02:07:10.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the numbers are not right and we have to</v>

3000
02:07:10.741 --> 02:07:15.741
<v Speaker 2>shrink government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So from you economically it made more </v>

3001
02:07:15.741 --> 02:07:15.741
<v Speaker 2>sense than Hillary.</v>

3002
02:07:15.741 --> 02:07:20.080
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean Hillary would be certainly a </v>

3003
02:07:20.080 --> 02:07:22.581
<v Speaker 2>disaster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the irony of it is why would she be </v>

3004
02:07:22.581 --> 02:07:22.581
<v Speaker 2>a disaster because she was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you no more big government.</v>

3005
02:07:22.581 --> 02:07:23.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3006
02:07:23.011 --> 02:07:25.770
<v Speaker 2>and I think she would have continued the</v>
<v Speaker 2>failed policies,</v>

3007
02:07:25.980 --> 02:07:30.980
<v Speaker 2>but unfortunately trump has continued </v>
<v Speaker 2>those policies as well and he could end </v>

3008
02:07:30.980 --> 02:07:35.330
<v Speaker 2>up being a bigger disaster if he is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>catalyst to put a Bernie Sanders type </v>

3009
02:07:35.330 --> 02:07:40.290
<v Speaker 2>into the White House in response in </v>
<v Speaker 2>response to how much worse the economy </v>

3010
02:07:40.691 --> 02:07:43.760
<v Speaker 2>gets and he takes the blame for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But do you.</v>

3011
02:07:43.780 --> 02:07:47.560
<v Speaker 2>So this is all predicated on your </v>
<v Speaker 2>initial view that the economy's going to</v>

3012
02:07:47.561 --> 02:07:50.300
<v Speaker 2>crash inside the next three years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it doesn't it,</v>

3013
02:07:50.301 --> 02:07:51.640
<v Speaker 2>it does really well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3014
02:07:51.641 --> 02:07:53.590
<v Speaker 2>it stays in this state that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

3015
02:07:53.790 --> 02:07:56.560
<v Speaker 2>Is it doing that well now it's just a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bubble.</v>

3016
02:07:56.620 --> 02:07:57.090
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

3017
02:07:57.120 --> 02:07:57.720
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3018
02:07:57.860 --> 02:08:01.000
<v Speaker 2>it's no different than it was when Obama</v>
<v Speaker 2>was president.</v>

3019
02:08:01.390 --> 02:08:03.760
<v Speaker 2>There's just some more optimism that </v>
<v Speaker 2>things are going to change.</v>

3020
02:08:03.761 --> 02:08:08.761
<v Speaker 2>But when you were talking about this </v>
<v Speaker 2>before it happened and I remember you </v>

3021
02:08:08.761 --> 02:08:10.300
<v Speaker 2>going on these different talk shows </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying this is going to crash and people</v>

3022
02:08:10.301 --> 02:08:11.710
<v Speaker 2>weren't listening to you and they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3023
02:08:11.711 --> 02:08:16.711
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Peter Shifts does nobody's talking </v>

3024
02:08:16.711 --> 02:08:16.711
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it did crash and then they,</v>

3025
02:08:16.711 --> 02:08:21.420
<v Speaker 2>they listened to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're the only one that's saying it's </v>

3026
02:08:21.420 --> 02:08:21.420
<v Speaker 2>going to crash again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3027
02:08:21.420 --> 02:08:22.330
<v Speaker 2>they never really listened to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They kind of tolerated me.</v>

3028
02:08:22.331 --> 02:08:23.500
<v Speaker 2>Here's the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had to.</v>

3029
02:08:23.510 --> 02:08:28.510
<v Speaker 2>Because you are right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well here's the irony of it all because </v>

3030
02:08:28.510 --> 02:08:32.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>leading up to the 2008 financial crisis </v>

3031
02:08:32.130 --> 02:08:34.000
<v Speaker 2>and if you go to my youtube channel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could see like my introductory video</v>

3032
02:08:34.270 --> 02:08:39.040
<v Speaker 2>is a little montage that I actually shot</v>
<v Speaker 2>as part of my senate campaign when I ran</v>

3033
02:08:39.041 --> 02:08:40.850
<v Speaker 2>for Senate in 2010,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a,</v>

3034
02:08:40.870 --> 02:08:45.870
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of people you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mocking me and then a lot of the shows </v>

3035
02:08:45.870 --> 02:08:46.210
<v Speaker 2>that I went on where they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

3036
02:08:46.211 --> 02:08:46.750
<v Speaker 2>you were right.</v>

3037
02:08:46.750 --> 02:08:48.040
<v Speaker 2>You know where the one guy that called </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

3038
02:08:48.280 --> 02:08:52.030
<v Speaker 2>So I used to be on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was on television a lot on Fox,</v>

3039
02:08:52.031 --> 02:08:53.530
<v Speaker 2>CNBC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>CNN,</v>

3040
02:08:53.560 --> 02:08:58.560
<v Speaker 2>Bloomberg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably once a week for three or four </v>

3041
02:08:58.560 --> 02:08:58.560
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was on something.</v>

3042
02:08:58.560 --> 02:09:01.120
<v Speaker 2>And then I used to get the Washington </v>
<v Speaker 2>Post used to call me the New York Times.</v>

3043
02:09:01.320 --> 02:09:01.750
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3044
02:09:01.760 --> 02:09:06.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people magazine articles were written </v>

3045
02:09:06.760 --> 02:09:09.361
<v Speaker 2>about me when I was just lone kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy guy talking about a housing </v>

3046
02:09:09.361 --> 02:09:13.561
<v Speaker 2>bubble,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about a financial crisis that </v>

3047
02:09:13.561 --> 02:09:15.391
<v Speaker 2>was coming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They at least gave me a platform to air </v>

3048
02:09:15.391 --> 02:09:17.790
<v Speaker 2>my views even though they mocked them </v>
<v Speaker 2>and laugh at them.</v>

3049
02:09:17.950 --> 02:09:20.440
<v Speaker 2>I was still there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like the gloom and doom guy,</v>

3050
02:09:20.470 --> 02:09:21.610
<v Speaker 2>Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doom.</v>

3051
02:09:21.930 --> 02:09:26.930
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Time magazine did an article </v>

3052
02:09:26.930 --> 02:09:26.930
<v Speaker 2>with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to pay,</v>

3053
02:09:26.930 --> 02:09:26.930
<v Speaker 2>had a sickle in my hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3054
02:09:26.930 --> 02:09:29.560
<v Speaker 2>like the grim reaper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>

3055
02:09:29.770 --> 02:09:32.260
<v Speaker 2>so then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we get the financial crisis and all</v>

3056
02:09:32.261 --> 02:09:34.360
<v Speaker 2>of a sudden I get a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>notoriety,</v>

3057
02:09:34.361 --> 02:09:35.480
<v Speaker 2>you knows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to Domus Ah,</v>

3058
02:09:35.590 --> 02:09:36.430
<v Speaker 2>Peter Schiff was right.</v>

3059
02:09:36.940 --> 02:09:41.740
<v Speaker 2>But all in all over the last few years </v>
<v Speaker 2>that nobody will talk to me.</v>

3060
02:09:41.741 --> 02:09:44.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm not on any television shows about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

3061
02:09:44.620 --> 02:09:45.100
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3062
02:09:45.120 --> 02:09:48.490
<v Speaker 2>I think that at this point people just </v>
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>

3063
02:09:48.491 --> 02:09:48.930
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3064
02:09:49.080 --> 02:09:51.700
<v Speaker 2>I've been saying talking about this </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem for so long.</v>

3065
02:09:51.701 --> 02:09:53.350
<v Speaker 2>They look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't know what he's talking about.</v>

3066
02:09:53.351 --> 02:09:58.351
<v Speaker 2>They forget that I was warning about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>problems in the housing market for four </v>

3067
02:09:58.351 --> 02:09:58.420
<v Speaker 2>or five years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3068
02:09:58.421 --> 02:10:00.460
<v Speaker 2>as the prices kept going up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3069
02:10:00.550 --> 02:10:02.890
<v Speaker 2>it's not like the things that I see </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen immediately,</v>

3070
02:10:03.220 --> 02:10:04.280
<v Speaker 2>but I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3071
02:10:04.480 --> 02:10:09.480
<v Speaker 2>at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe in the past they thought maybe </v>

3072
02:10:09.480 --> 02:10:09.730
<v Speaker 2>there was a chance I could be right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though it was a slim chance.</v>

3073
02:10:09.731 --> 02:10:12.160
<v Speaker 2>Now they probably think it's impossible </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I could be right.</v>

3074
02:10:12.310 --> 02:10:17.310
<v Speaker 2>So why even give me any air time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean like I come on shows like </v>

3075
02:10:17.310 --> 02:10:17.710
<v Speaker 2>yours and people actually get to hear </v>
<v Speaker 2>the truth,</v>

3076
02:10:17.860 --> 02:10:20.560
<v Speaker 2>but if you go back to what I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually predicting,</v>

3077
02:10:21.550 --> 02:10:26.260
<v Speaker 2>2008 financial crisis was the beginning </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the end,</v>

3078
02:10:26.261 --> 02:10:27.040
<v Speaker 2>not the end.</v>

3079
02:10:27.250 --> 02:10:28.660
<v Speaker 2>What I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I was predicting.</v>

3080
02:10:28.661 --> 02:10:30.790
<v Speaker 2>And I wrote a book about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crash proof,</v>

3081
02:10:30.791 --> 02:10:32.740
<v Speaker 2>how to profit from the coming economic </v>
<v Speaker 2>collapse.</v>

3082
02:10:32.741 --> 02:10:34.270
<v Speaker 2>It came in February.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh seven.</v>

3083
02:10:34.760 --> 02:10:39.760
<v Speaker 2>I said we have this huge bubble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have this housing bubble that the </v>

3084
02:10:39.760 --> 02:10:39.760
<v Speaker 2>Federal Reserve created,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3085
02:10:39.760 --> 02:10:41.960
<v Speaker 2>Not the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not the private enterprise.</v>

3086
02:10:41.990 --> 02:10:44.240
<v Speaker 2>It was created by government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in fact,</v>

3087
02:10:44.270 --> 02:10:47.570
<v Speaker 2>after the financial crisis happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Congress had a,</v>

3088
02:10:47.571 --> 02:10:48.500
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

3089
02:10:48.540 --> 02:10:51.230
<v Speaker 2>a hearing to try to determine why we had</v>
<v Speaker 2>a financial crisis.</v>

3090
02:10:51.320 --> 02:10:56.320
<v Speaker 2>And I tried my best to get invited to </v>
<v Speaker 2>testify and they refused to let me be </v>

3091
02:10:56.320 --> 02:10:59.801
<v Speaker 2>there because they didn't have anybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>there that predicted it because they </v>

3092
02:10:59.801 --> 02:11:02.190
<v Speaker 2>wanted to basically come to a conclusion</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they had already arrived.</v>

3093
02:11:02.191 --> 02:11:06.290
<v Speaker 2>That was that it was caused by a lack of</v>
<v Speaker 2>regulation and we need more government.</v>

3094
02:11:06.291 --> 02:11:11.291
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they didn't want me there to say it </v>

3095
02:11:11.291 --> 02:11:11.291
<v Speaker 2>was caused by government and we needed </v>
<v Speaker 2>less government,</v>

3096
02:11:11.291 --> 02:11:13.250
<v Speaker 2>although by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have testified at Congress twice since</v>

3097
02:11:13.251 --> 02:11:16.370
<v Speaker 2>then and both of my testimonies are on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the,</v>

3098
02:11:16.390 --> 02:11:16.970
<v Speaker 2>on Youtube.</v>

3099
02:11:16.970 --> 02:11:19.130
<v Speaker 2>And you got to watch him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's incredible stuff.</v>

3100
02:11:19.280 --> 02:11:24.280
<v Speaker 2>And in fact after I was on the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>time I was convinced they would never </v>

3101
02:11:24.280 --> 02:11:26.330
<v Speaker 2>invite me back because I don't treat </v>
<v Speaker 2>these guys with the type of respect that</v>

3102
02:11:26.331 --> 02:11:31.331
<v Speaker 2>they normally get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I thought they would never invite me </v>

3103
02:11:31.331 --> 02:11:31.830
<v Speaker 2>back and they actually invited me back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the guy that invited me back on</v>

3104
02:11:31.870 --> 02:11:34.250
<v Speaker 2>fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3105
02:11:34.460 --> 02:11:35.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'll never.</v>

3106
02:11:35.700 --> 02:11:38.180
<v Speaker 2>There's no way that they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>bring me out again.</v>

3107
02:11:38.750 --> 02:11:43.750
<v Speaker 2>Much better suited for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean in those talk shows they bring </v>

3108
02:11:43.750 --> 02:11:47.171
<v Speaker 2>you on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're so much better suited to doing </v>

3109
02:11:47.171 --> 02:11:47.530
<v Speaker 2>your own videos or doing something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>this where you could just go on,</v>

3110
02:11:47.540 --> 02:11:48.040
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3111
02:11:48.110 --> 02:11:50.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now see now a complex issues.</v>

3112
02:11:51.140 --> 02:11:56.140
<v Speaker 2>Now I have my own platform.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a lot more people who listen to </v>

3113
02:11:56.140 --> 02:11:57.650
<v Speaker 2>my podcast and who you know then that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>did back then,</v>

3114
02:11:57.651 --> 02:12:02.651
<v Speaker 2>but the point that I wanted to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the crisis is I wrote back then </v>

3115
02:12:02.651 --> 02:12:04.280
<v Speaker 2>that we had this bubble and we were </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to have this crash,</v>

3116
02:12:04.970 --> 02:12:08.660
<v Speaker 2>but the economic crisis was not going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be that.</v>

3117
02:12:08.660 --> 02:12:11.780
<v Speaker 2>It was that the collapse that I saw </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming in,</v>

3118
02:12:11.781 --> 02:12:14.840
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight was the beginning.</v>

3119
02:12:14.960 --> 02:12:19.960
<v Speaker 2>I said that we have this disease that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Fed has created and it's manifested </v>

3120
02:12:19.960 --> 02:12:22.340
<v Speaker 2>itself in this housing bubble and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to pop and we're going to have the</v>

3121
02:12:22.341 --> 02:12:24.200
<v Speaker 2>worst recession since the great </v>
<v Speaker 2>depression.</v>

3122
02:12:24.410 --> 02:12:26.270
<v Speaker 2>We're going to have double digit </v>
<v Speaker 2>unemployment.</v>

3123
02:12:26.271 --> 02:12:27.860
<v Speaker 2>We're going to have trillion dollar </v>
<v Speaker 2>deficits,</v>

3124
02:12:28.190 --> 02:12:30.290
<v Speaker 2>but I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not what's going to kill us.</v>

3125
02:12:30.320 --> 02:12:32.690
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to die of that disease.</v>

3126
02:12:32.780 --> 02:12:35.090
<v Speaker 2>That disease is survivable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

3127
02:12:35.091 --> 02:12:37.400
<v Speaker 2>what's going to kill us is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>government's cure.</v>

3128
02:12:37.730 --> 02:12:42.730
<v Speaker 2>They're going to print so much money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to try to reflate these </v>

3129
02:12:42.730 --> 02:12:45.650
<v Speaker 2>bubbles and that's going to cause a </v>
<v Speaker 2>dollar crisis and a bond crisis,</v>

3130
02:12:45.651 --> 02:12:49.010
<v Speaker 2>and that was what was gonna destroy the </v>
<v Speaker 2>economy and that's not happened yet.</v>

3131
02:12:49.430 --> 02:12:52.700
<v Speaker 2>Now what I did not know at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I didn't put a date on it,</v>

3132
02:12:53.150 --> 02:12:54.590
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know it would take so long.</v>

3133
02:12:54.710 --> 02:12:56.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean here we are 10 years later </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost,</v>

3134
02:12:57.110 --> 02:12:58.880
<v Speaker 2>and it has.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That hasn't happened yet,</v>

3135
02:12:58.881 --> 02:13:02.360
<v Speaker 2>but you think it's got to happen and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what I got wrong,</v>

3136
02:13:02.900 --> 02:13:06.830
<v Speaker 2>I said the government was going to try </v>
<v Speaker 2>to reflate the bubbles.</v>

3137
02:13:07.130 --> 02:13:09.950
<v Speaker 2>I assume they would fail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They succeeded.</v>

3138
02:13:10.280 --> 02:13:13.300
<v Speaker 2>The bubbles now are bigger than the ones</v>
<v Speaker 2>that popped in.</v>

3139
02:13:13.301 --> 02:13:18.301
<v Speaker 2>Oh eight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what's the difference between </v>

3140
02:13:18.301 --> 02:13:19.370
<v Speaker 2>bubbles and an actual functioning </v>
<v Speaker 2>economy that's sustainable,</v>

3141
02:13:19.490 --> 02:13:21.050
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if it's doing well right now,</v>

3142
02:13:21.051 --> 02:13:23.060
<v Speaker 2>you agree it's doing well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not doing well.</v>

3143
02:13:23.061 --> 02:13:28.061
<v Speaker 2>It's a mobile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the difference between a real </v>

3144
02:13:28.061 --> 02:13:30.761
<v Speaker 2>economy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the real economy grows from production </v>

3145
02:13:30.761 --> 02:13:30.761
<v Speaker 2>and savings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3146
02:13:30.761 --> 02:13:30.761
<v Speaker 2>And the real.</v>

3147
02:13:32.030 --> 02:13:37.030
<v Speaker 3>We're making stuff and consuming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you look right now at the </v>

3148
02:13:37.030 --> 02:13:37.030
<v Speaker 3>savings rate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3149
02:13:37.030 --> 02:13:40.530
<v Speaker 3>The savings rate is near record low and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the politicians try to say,</v>

3150
02:13:40.770 --> 02:13:42.870
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is because the economy is so good,</v>

3151
02:13:42.900 --> 02:13:44.430
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody is out there spending.</v>

3152
02:13:44.520 --> 02:13:47.370
<v Speaker 3>That's a bunch of nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If the economy was good,</v>

3153
02:13:47.371 --> 02:13:48.810
<v Speaker 3>people would have more savings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3154
02:13:48.811 --> 02:13:49.080
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

3155
02:13:49.260 --> 02:13:54.260
<v Speaker 3>if you ran into a friend of yours that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you hadn't seen in awhile and you ask </v>

3156
02:13:54.260 --> 02:13:54.260
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

3157
02:13:54.260 --> 02:13:55.050
<v Speaker 3>how you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>

3158
02:13:55.200 --> 02:13:57.270
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I've maxed out all my credit cards.</v>

3159
02:13:57.271 --> 02:13:59.430
<v Speaker 3>I took out a second mortgage on my </v>
<v Speaker 3>house.</v>

3160
02:13:59.640 --> 02:14:00.430
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3161
02:14:00.490 --> 02:14:03.030
<v Speaker 3>I blew through my retirement account.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3162
02:14:03.240 --> 02:14:04.020
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3163
02:14:04.021 --> 02:14:07.170
<v Speaker 3>you're doing great work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas if another friend said,</v>

3164
02:14:07.380 --> 02:14:08.340
<v Speaker 3>how you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3165
02:14:08.341 --> 02:14:11.760
<v Speaker 3>I just fully funded my pension.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got massive savings.</v>

3166
02:14:11.761 --> 02:14:12.350
<v Speaker 3>I got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3167
02:14:12.510 --> 02:14:14.610
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I paid off all my credit cards.</v>

3168
02:14:14.610 --> 02:14:18.050
<v Speaker 3>I own my house free and clear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the guy that's doing well right?</v>

3169
02:14:18.120 --> 02:14:19.440
<v Speaker 3>When you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're doing well,</v>

3170
02:14:19.550 --> 02:14:20.850
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get out of debt.</v>

3171
02:14:21.420 --> 02:14:25.440
<v Speaker 3>So we're not doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're all living based on a bubble based</v>

3172
02:14:25.441 --> 02:14:28.470
<v Speaker 3>on cheap money being spread out into the</v>
<v Speaker 3>economy.</v>

3173
02:14:28.560 --> 02:14:30.240
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is the stock market going up?</v>

3174
02:14:30.241 --> 02:14:32.850
<v Speaker 3>Because the buybacks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why are people spending,</v>

3175
02:14:32.851 --> 02:14:36.180
<v Speaker 3>because they're going deeper into debt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have record student loans,</v>

3176
02:14:36.270 --> 02:14:40.020
<v Speaker 3>record credit card debt record autodebt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's loaded up with that.</v>

3177
02:14:40.021 --> 02:14:45.021
<v Speaker 3>They just had a survey out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that less than half the people </v>

3178
02:14:45.021 --> 02:14:48.210
<v Speaker 3>could come up with like 400 bucks if </v>
<v Speaker 3>they had an emergency.</v>

3179
02:14:48.390 --> 02:14:49.650
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's nothing.</v>

3180
02:14:49.920 --> 02:14:54.920
<v Speaker 3>People have nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're living paycheck to paycheck and </v>

3181
02:14:54.920 --> 02:14:54.920
<v Speaker 3>even that they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

3182
02:14:54.920 --> 02:14:57.270
<v Speaker 3>they need credit cards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have huge budget deficits.</v>

3183
02:14:57.271 --> 02:14:59.020
<v Speaker 3>We have huge trade deficits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3184
02:14:59.090 --> 02:15:01.850
<v Speaker 3>we got record numbers of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>older people that,</v>

3185
02:15:01.890 --> 02:15:04.170
<v Speaker 3>that are working because they can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>afford to retire.</v>

3186
02:15:04.380 --> 02:15:09.380
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the young people can't get jobs because </v>

3187
02:15:09.380 --> 02:15:09.380
<v Speaker 3>they have those skills and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>still.</v>

3188
02:15:09.380 --> 02:15:09.930
<v Speaker 3>So the economy is not real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3189
02:15:09.931 --> 02:15:11.630
<v Speaker 3>It's all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all disillusion.</v>

3190
02:15:11.760 --> 02:15:16.760
<v Speaker 3>Just like it was what was going on </v>
<v Speaker 3>before 2008 people were living off their</v>

3191
02:15:17.701 --> 02:15:18.600
<v Speaker 3>home equity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3192
02:15:18.601 --> 02:15:21.210
<v Speaker 3>out here in California,</v>
<v Speaker 3>homes are going up.</v>

3193
02:15:21.211 --> 02:15:23.520
<v Speaker 3>People were taking out home equity lines</v>
<v Speaker 3>of credit.</v>

3194
02:15:23.700 --> 02:15:26.850
<v Speaker 3>They were taken vacations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were buying new cars,</v>

3195
02:15:26.851 --> 02:15:30.630
<v Speaker 3>they were remodeling their houses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All that prosperity was phony.</v>

3196
02:15:30.660 --> 02:15:33.240
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't run well upon fake wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3197
02:15:33.241 --> 02:15:36.330
<v Speaker 3>And then the wealth came down and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>talked about that for years,</v>

3198
02:15:36.331 --> 02:15:39.600
<v Speaker 3>what we have even faker prosperity now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not,</v>

3199
02:15:39.601 --> 02:15:44.601
<v Speaker 3>it's even less prosperous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even fewer people are feeling the </v>

3200
02:15:44.601 --> 02:15:44.601
<v Speaker 3>benefits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3201
02:15:44.601 --> 02:15:49.310
<v Speaker 3>than before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the real economy is getting sicker </v>

3202
02:15:49.310 --> 02:15:52.341
<v Speaker 3>and sicker as it takes more and more air</v>
<v Speaker 3>to inflate the bubble because in order </v>

3203
02:15:52.341 --> 02:15:56.331
<v Speaker 3>to keep the bubbles from popping,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the government and the central bank has </v>

3204
02:15:56.331 --> 02:15:59.970
<v Speaker 3>to keep misdirecting resources out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the real economy to sustain the bubbles.</v>

3205
02:16:00.050 --> 02:16:02.050
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so talk me through two things.</v>

3206
02:16:02.051 --> 02:16:07.051
<v Speaker 4>One,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is going to happen that's going to </v>

3207
02:16:07.051 --> 02:16:09.841
<v Speaker 4>cause this big collapse?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You predicted way back in 2007 that </v>

3208
02:16:09.841 --> 02:16:11.230
<v Speaker 4>hasn't actually hit yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's going to cause that?</v>

3209
02:16:11.231 --> 02:16:16.231
<v Speaker 4>How's it going to go down?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what can the average person like me </v>

3210
02:16:16.231 --> 02:16:18.490
<v Speaker 4>that knows Jack Shit about economics?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What can we do to protect ourselves?</v>

3211
02:16:18.670 --> 02:16:19.120
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

3212
02:16:19.121 --> 02:16:24.121
<v Speaker 3>you probably know more about economics </v>
<v Speaker 3>than the average guy with an economics </v>

3213
02:16:24.121 --> 02:16:24.850
<v Speaker 3>degree from American University to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3214
02:16:24.851 --> 02:16:26.410
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or just for having common sense.</v>

3215
02:16:26.411 --> 02:16:26.780
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

3216
02:16:26.920 --> 02:16:29.200
<v Speaker 3>when you go to a US college and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>study economics,</v>

3217
02:16:29.350 --> 02:16:31.480
<v Speaker 3>they basically beat all the common sense</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of you,</v>

3218
02:16:31.660 --> 02:16:34.360
<v Speaker 3>and by the time you graduate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a complete moron when it comes to</v>

3219
02:16:34.361 --> 02:16:35.590
<v Speaker 3>economics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do they do?</v>

3220
02:16:35.950 --> 02:16:38.340
<v Speaker 3>What would they teach them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>All this nonsense,</v>

3221
02:16:38.550 --> 02:16:38.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

3222
02:16:38.910 --> 02:16:39.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

3223
02:16:39.590 --> 02:16:43.840
<v Speaker 3>and that's why all the big economists in</v>
<v Speaker 3>academia on Wall Street,</v>

3224
02:16:43.841 --> 02:16:48.841
<v Speaker 3>at government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're all a bunch of idiots when it </v>

3225
02:16:48.841 --> 02:16:48.841
<v Speaker 3>comes to economics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

3226
02:16:48.841 --> 02:16:48.910
<v Speaker 3>a lot more than they do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3227
02:16:48.940 --> 02:16:50.260
<v Speaker 3>not that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're an idiot.</v>

3228
02:16:50.261 --> 02:16:51.010
<v Speaker 3>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just,</v>

3229
02:16:51.100 --> 02:16:53.530
<v Speaker 3>you just have to have common sense </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they lack lack,</v>

3230
02:16:53.531 --> 02:16:55.390
<v Speaker 3>common sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But to get back to your question,</v>

3231
02:16:55.560 --> 02:16:56.260
<v Speaker 3>this is horrible.</v>

3232
02:16:56.460 --> 02:17:01.460
<v Speaker 3>This is going to go down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is how I think it's going to go </v>

3233
02:17:01.460 --> 02:17:03.571
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So everybody believes that the Fed's </v>

3234
02:17:03.571 --> 02:17:05.070
<v Speaker 3>policy of quantitative easing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3235
02:17:05.080 --> 02:17:06.330
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

3236
02:17:06.460 --> 02:17:07.060
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3237
02:17:07.061 --> 02:17:10.540
<v Speaker 3>low zero percent interest rates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody believes it was a success.</v>

3238
02:17:10.630 --> 02:17:13.970
<v Speaker 3>They believe the Fed revive the economy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they put out the fire.</v>

3239
02:17:13.971 --> 02:17:14.720
<v Speaker 3>That's the narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3240
02:17:14.830 --> 02:17:19.830
<v Speaker 3>They still don't realize that the Fed </v>
<v Speaker 3>lit the fire and they didn't really put </v>

3241
02:17:19.830 --> 02:17:19.830
<v Speaker 3>it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just Kinda,</v>

3242
02:17:19.830 --> 02:17:20.710
<v Speaker 3>it's simmering and people don't notice </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

3243
02:17:21.160 --> 02:17:23.140
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

3244
02:17:23.220 --> 02:17:27.640
<v Speaker 3>what's going to happen is the Fed never </v>
<v Speaker 3>was able to normalize interest rates,</v>

3245
02:17:27.641 --> 02:17:29.380
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rates or stole two percent.</v>

3246
02:17:29.440 --> 02:17:30.850
<v Speaker 3>That's still really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really low.</v>

3247
02:17:31.090 --> 02:17:33.760
<v Speaker 3>And for all the talk about shrinking </v>
<v Speaker 3>their balance sheet,</v>

3248
02:17:33.880 --> 02:17:35.160
<v Speaker 3>it really hasn't shrunk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3249
02:17:35.161 --> 02:17:40.161
<v Speaker 3>It's still enormous and I think that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>economy is going to slip into recession,</v>

3250
02:17:40.330 --> 02:17:40.600
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3251
02:17:41.020 --> 02:17:44.590
<v Speaker 3>And when it does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Fed never got interest rates back to</v>

3252
02:17:44.620 --> 02:17:47.110
<v Speaker 3>five percent or six percent where they </v>
<v Speaker 3>normally bring them.</v>

3253
02:17:47.650 --> 02:17:52.650
<v Speaker 3>They never shrink the balance sheet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now all of a sudden we go into this </v>

3254
02:17:52.650 --> 02:17:52.720
<v Speaker 3>recession,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's going to be as a,</v>

3255
02:17:52.780 --> 02:17:57.780
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a stagflation because inflation is now </v>

3256
02:17:57.780 --> 02:17:57.780
<v Speaker 3>really starting to pick up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3257
02:17:57.780 --> 02:18:02.340
<v Speaker 3>prices rise with a lag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The inflation is the expansion of the </v>

3258
02:18:02.340 --> 02:18:03.430
<v Speaker 3>money supply.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what the word inflate means.</v>

3259
02:18:03.490 --> 02:18:04.930
<v Speaker 3>It comes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's to expand,</v>

3260
02:18:04.931 --> 02:18:06.670
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't expand prices.</v>

3261
02:18:06.671 --> 02:18:11.671
<v Speaker 3>Prices can go up and they go down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they go and expand what expands as the </v>

3262
02:18:11.671 --> 02:18:15.121
<v Speaker 3>supply of money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the supply of money expanded and </v>

3263
02:18:15.121 --> 02:18:16.240
<v Speaker 3>a lot of that went into financial </v>
<v Speaker 3>assets.</v>

3264
02:18:16.241 --> 02:18:18.520
<v Speaker 3>So inflation costs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stock prices to go up,</v>

3265
02:18:18.521 --> 02:18:20.140
<v Speaker 3>it caused real estate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>prices go up,</v>

3266
02:18:20.320 --> 02:18:24.700
<v Speaker 3>it caused bond prices go up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it caused the price of rare art to go up</v>

3267
02:18:24.701 --> 02:18:27.460
<v Speaker 3>and all sorts of things went up because </v>
<v Speaker 3>of inflation.</v>

3268
02:18:27.800 --> 02:18:32.800
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ultimately a lot of that inflation that </v>

3269
02:18:32.800 --> 02:18:32.800
<v Speaker 3>was going to end up in the supermarket,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3270
02:18:32.800 --> 02:18:33.000
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at,</v>

3271
02:18:33.001 --> 02:18:34.300
<v Speaker 3>at the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the gas station.</v>

3272
02:18:34.301 --> 02:18:39.301
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so you're going to have that at the </v>

3273
02:18:39.301 --> 02:18:40.651
<v Speaker 3>same time that we have the recession.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now the Fed is going to have to go back </v>

3274
02:18:40.901 --> 02:18:45.901
<v Speaker 3>to the only thing it knows how to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to do qe four and we're </v>

3275
02:18:45.901 --> 02:18:49.921
<v Speaker 3>going to cut rates back to zero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But now the markets are going to see </v>

3276
02:18:49.921 --> 02:18:53.680
<v Speaker 3>this and they're going to wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You never normalized interest rates,</v>

3277
02:18:53.830 --> 02:18:57.520
<v Speaker 3>you never shrunk your balance sheet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now you're going to expand it again.</v>

3278
02:18:57.790 --> 02:19:00.250
<v Speaker 3>Now you're going back to zero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wait a minute,</v>

3279
02:19:00.251 --> 02:19:03.910
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you couldn't normalize interest rates</v>

3280
02:19:04.300 --> 02:19:09.300
<v Speaker 3>following this last recession,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how are you going to do it in the </v>

3281
02:19:09.300 --> 02:19:09.760
<v Speaker 3>future?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you couldn't shrink a four and</v>

3282
02:19:09.761 --> 02:19:12.290
<v Speaker 3>a half trillion dollar balance sheet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how are you going to drink?</v>

3283
02:19:12.490 --> 02:19:17.490
<v Speaker 3>Drink a six or a $7,000,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>balance sheet if you couldn't raise </v>

3284
02:19:17.490 --> 02:19:18.460
<v Speaker 3>interest rates back to normal when the </v>
<v Speaker 3>national debt,</v>

3285
02:19:18.670 --> 02:19:22.870
<v Speaker 3>our national debt is not 21 trillion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What if it goes up to 25 trillion,</v>

3286
02:19:22.871 --> 02:19:24.250
<v Speaker 3>30 trillion?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3287
02:19:24.251 --> 02:19:27.530
<v Speaker 3>one of the reasons the Fed can't raise </v>
<v Speaker 3>rates is because we have too debt.</v>

3288
02:19:27.740 --> 02:19:32.740
<v Speaker 3>Nobody can afford to pay the higher </v>
<v Speaker 3>rates when inflation was running out of </v>

3289
02:19:32.740 --> 02:19:35.750
<v Speaker 3>control in the 19 seventies and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be a lot worse now.</v>

3290
02:19:35.751 --> 02:19:40.751
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The inflation that we had in the 19 </v>

3291
02:19:40.751 --> 02:19:42.470
<v Speaker 3>seventies was created in the 19 sixties </v>
<v Speaker 3>by Lyndon Johnson,</v>

3292
02:19:42.590 --> 02:19:45.590
<v Speaker 3>right by the great society,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the war on poverty,</v>

3293
02:19:45.710 --> 02:19:47.990
<v Speaker 3>the Vietnam War,</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to the moon.</v>

3294
02:19:48.020 --> 02:19:53.020
<v Speaker 3>We borrowed all sorts of money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We ran big deficits and the consequence </v>

3295
02:19:53.020 --> 02:19:55.910
<v Speaker 3>was the dollar crashed in the seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gold went through the roof,</v>

3296
02:19:55.970 --> 02:19:58.850
<v Speaker 3>oil went through the roof and finally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3297
02:19:58.851 --> 02:20:01.950
<v Speaker 3>we had to do something about it at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>end of the seventies because when,</v>

3298
02:20:01.951 --> 02:20:02.360
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

3299
02:20:02.390 --> 02:20:05.840
<v Speaker 3>when Nixon came in and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Ford came in,</v>

3300
02:20:05.880 --> 02:20:08.210
<v Speaker 3>they just continued the same policies.</v>

3301
02:20:08.210 --> 02:20:11.300
<v Speaker 3>They were know very liberal Republicans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rockefeller Republicans,</v>

3302
02:20:12.140 --> 02:20:17.140
<v Speaker 3>and we didn't do anything about </v>
<v Speaker 3>inflation until Reagan came in and </v>

3303
02:20:17.140 --> 02:20:19.811
<v Speaker 3>Volcker was there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so how did they stop the inflation </v>

3304
02:20:19.811 --> 02:20:23.261
<v Speaker 3>from running out of control?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Volcker jacked interest rates up to 20 </v>

3305
02:20:23.261 --> 02:20:23.270
<v Speaker 3>percent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>20 percent.</v>

3306
02:20:23.360 --> 02:20:26.960
<v Speaker 3>And we had a recession where the Fed was</v>
<v Speaker 3>raising interest rates,</v>

3307
02:20:27.230 --> 02:20:30.170
<v Speaker 3>but that saved the dollar and it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

3308
02:20:30.180 --> 02:20:35.180
<v Speaker 3>it broke the inflationary cycle that was</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the economy raising the interest </v>

3309
02:20:35.180 --> 02:20:35.180
<v Speaker 3>rates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes they will.</v>

3310
02:20:35.180 --> 02:20:36.520
<v Speaker 3>They had to stop the inflation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3311
02:20:36.530 --> 02:20:37.020
<v Speaker 3>They had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had,</v>

3312
02:20:37.110 --> 02:20:38.540
<v Speaker 3>they had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had a break and of course,</v>

3313
02:20:38.630 --> 02:20:39.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Reagan did some other,</v>

3314
02:20:39.800 --> 02:20:41.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tax reform and things like that.</v>

3315
02:20:41.301 --> 02:20:43.340
<v Speaker 3>But the Fed really finally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3316
02:20:43.341 --> 02:20:48.341
<v Speaker 3>got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got out in front of the inflation curve </v>

3317
02:20:48.341 --> 02:20:50.710
<v Speaker 3>and they brought it down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you think about the difference </v>

3318
02:20:50.710 --> 02:20:53.120
<v Speaker 3>between the United States in 1980 and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the United States today,</v>

3319
02:20:53.270 --> 02:20:56.690
<v Speaker 3>we were still the world's biggest </v>
<v Speaker 3>creditor nation in 1980,</v>

3320
02:20:56.730 --> 02:20:58.280
<v Speaker 3>not the world's biggest debtor nation.</v>

3321
02:20:58.520 --> 02:21:00.920
<v Speaker 3>The national debt was a fraction of what</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is now.</v>

3322
02:21:00.921 --> 02:21:02.480
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe it was like a half a billion,</v>

3323
02:21:02.630 --> 02:21:04.490
<v Speaker 3>500 billion or I don't know the exact </v>
<v Speaker 3>amount,</v>

3324
02:21:04.491 --> 02:21:06.830
<v Speaker 3>but well under a trillion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3325
02:21:07.130 --> 02:21:12.130
<v Speaker 3>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the national debt was financed with long</v>

3326
02:21:12.431 --> 02:21:17.431
<v Speaker 3>term bonds like 10 year 30 year bonds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when interest rates went up to 20 </v>

3327
02:21:18.111 --> 02:21:23.111
<v Speaker 3>percent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that didn't affect the majority of the </v>

3328
02:21:23.111 --> 02:21:26.291
<v Speaker 3>debt that was out there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that only increased the cost to the </v>

3329
02:21:26.291 --> 02:21:27.950
<v Speaker 3>government of the new debt that came </v>
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>

3330
02:21:27.951 --> 02:21:28.850
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The new borrowing.</v>

3331
02:21:29.030 --> 02:21:34.030
<v Speaker 3>But today the $21,000,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>national debt is predominantly treasury </v>

3332
02:21:34.461 --> 02:21:36.710
<v Speaker 3>bills,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff that matures in a year or less.</v>

3333
02:21:37.220 --> 02:21:39.470
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so if interest rates had to go up to</v>

3334
02:21:39.471 --> 02:21:44.471
<v Speaker 3>let's say 10 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the government would have to pay 10 </v>

3335
02:21:44.471 --> 02:21:45.560
<v Speaker 3>percent within a few years on the entire</v>
<v Speaker 3>national debt.</v>

3336
02:21:45.890 --> 02:21:48.110
<v Speaker 3>So where were the government get all </v>
<v Speaker 3>that money?</v>

3337
02:21:48.350 --> 02:21:49.060
<v Speaker 3>And it's not this.</v>

3338
02:21:49.070 --> 02:21:51.650
<v Speaker 3>The government corporations have never </v>
<v Speaker 3>been this levered up.</v>

3339
02:21:51.940 --> 02:21:54.070
<v Speaker 3>Individuals have never been this level </v>
<v Speaker 3>of.</v>

3340
02:21:54.110 --> 02:21:56.330
<v Speaker 3>They didn't have adjustable rate </v>
<v Speaker 3>mortgages back then.</v>

3341
02:21:56.331 --> 02:22:01.331
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now you've got to have a lot of people </v>

3342
02:22:01.331 --> 02:22:01.331
<v Speaker 3>that have arms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3343
02:22:01.331 --> 02:22:01.331
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3344
02:22:01.331 --> 02:22:05.010
<v Speaker 3>their mortgage debt would go up with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So at this point the Fed can't really </v>

3345
02:22:05.010 --> 02:22:09.260
<v Speaker 3>fight inflation because it doesn't have </v>
<v Speaker 3>the tools because we have so much debt.</v>

3346
02:22:09.440 --> 02:22:12.680
<v Speaker 3>If they raised interest rates to fight </v>
<v Speaker 3>inflation,</v>

3347
02:22:13.070 --> 02:22:15.920
<v Speaker 3>the collapse would be so much worse than</v>
<v Speaker 3>2008.</v>

3348
02:22:16.010 --> 02:22:18.590
<v Speaker 3>All the banks that they bailed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would fail again,</v>

3349
02:22:18.830 --> 02:22:23.830
<v Speaker 3>but they couldn't bail them out a second</v>
<v Speaker 3>time because they can't bail them out </v>

3350
02:22:23.830 --> 02:22:27.491
<v Speaker 3>and fight inflation at the same time </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you can't ease and tightened </v>

3351
02:22:27.491 --> 02:22:27.690
<v Speaker 3>simultaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one or the other.</v>

3352
02:22:27.750 --> 02:22:32.340
<v Speaker 3>So I think when the markets see that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going back to Qe,</v>

3353
02:22:32.550 --> 02:22:37.550
<v Speaker 3>that we're going back to zero,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to realize that this is </v>

3354
02:22:37.550 --> 02:22:38.220
<v Speaker 3>not temporary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that this is permanent,</v>

3355
02:22:38.460 --> 02:22:41.040
<v Speaker 3>that the Fed can never normalize </v>
<v Speaker 3>interest rates.</v>

3356
02:22:41.160 --> 02:22:43.260
<v Speaker 3>That the balance sheet is never going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>shrink.</v>

3357
02:22:43.380 --> 02:22:46.680
<v Speaker 3>That we're a banana republic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we are monetizing our debt,</v>

3358
02:22:46.980 --> 02:22:51.980
<v Speaker 3>that the Fed has no ability to drain </v>
<v Speaker 3>that liquidity and no ability to fight </v>

3359
02:22:51.980 --> 02:22:56.331
<v Speaker 3>inflation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That means the dollar is a bottomless </v>

3360
02:22:56.331 --> 02:22:58.761
<v Speaker 3>pit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That means a dollar is going to keep </v>

3361
02:22:58.761 --> 02:23:00.621
<v Speaker 3>falling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That means nobody is going to want to </v>

3362
02:23:00.621 --> 02:23:00.621
<v Speaker 3>own it and everybody's going to want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get out of dollars and everybody's going</v>

3363
02:23:00.621 --> 02:23:05.351
<v Speaker 3>to want to get out of any bond that has </v>
<v Speaker 3>dollar denominated in dollars and then </v>

3364
02:23:05.351 --> 02:23:06.780
<v Speaker 3>the Federal Reserve in order to keep </v>
<v Speaker 3>interest rates from rising,</v>

3365
02:23:06.930 --> 02:23:08.760
<v Speaker 3>they might have to start buying Muni </v>
<v Speaker 3>bonds,</v>

3366
02:23:08.880 --> 02:23:10.740
<v Speaker 3>they might have to start buying </v>
<v Speaker 3>corporate bonds.</v>

3367
02:23:10.741 --> 02:23:15.741
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise interest rates are going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>skyrocket and that just fuels the </v>

3368
02:23:15.741 --> 02:23:19.041
<v Speaker 3>inflationary fire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then we get a currency crisis right </v>

3369
02:23:19.041 --> 02:23:21.210
<v Speaker 3>where the dollar is plunging.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Prices are skyrocketing,</v>

3370
02:23:21.450 --> 02:23:24.120
<v Speaker 3>that is real pain and who knows what </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to do.</v>

3371
02:23:24.240 --> 02:23:29.240
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they're going to have a price </v>
<v Speaker 3>controls which are just going to </v>

3372
02:23:29.240 --> 02:23:29.490
<v Speaker 3>backfire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then we're going to have shortages.</v>

3373
02:23:29.491 --> 02:23:32.100
<v Speaker 3>We're going to have rationing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to have civil unrest.</v>

3374
02:23:32.101 --> 02:23:37.101
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is going to be ugly when it hits </v>

3375
02:23:37.101 --> 02:23:39.921
<v Speaker 3>the fan and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's dangerous to do this and the </v>

3376
02:23:39.921 --> 02:23:41.820
<v Speaker 3>backdrop where so many people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>inclined to vote for a socialist because</v>

3377
02:23:41.821 --> 02:23:46.821
<v Speaker 3>that's going to be the type of economic </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment where socialism can thrive </v>

3378
02:23:46.821 --> 02:23:50.811
<v Speaker 3>because socialists always want to look </v>
<v Speaker 3>for a scapegoat who can we blame this on</v>

3379
02:23:51.150 --> 02:23:56.150
<v Speaker 3>and it's very easy to blame it on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rich or the businesses or the </v>

3380
02:23:56.150 --> 02:23:59.181
<v Speaker 3>corporations or the Republicans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's what's gonna happen </v>

3381
02:23:59.181 --> 02:23:59.550
<v Speaker 3>if this happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3382
02:23:59.580 --> 02:24:04.580
<v Speaker 3>sometime over the next few years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if it doesn't happen in trump's </v>

3383
02:24:04.580 --> 02:24:07.431
<v Speaker 3>first term,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no way he finishes his second </v>

3384
02:24:07.431 --> 02:24:09.000
<v Speaker 3>term without this happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No Way I can ask you this.</v>

3385
02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:12.510
<v Speaker 3>If he calls you and says Peter Schiff </v>
<v Speaker 3>had on the Joe Rogan podcast,</v>

3386
02:24:12.530 --> 02:24:14.910
<v Speaker 3>it was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do I do?</v>

3387
02:24:15.420 --> 02:24:16.790
<v Speaker 3>What do you tell them to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3388
02:24:16.910 --> 02:24:21.910
<v Speaker 3>I think he has people that were </v>
<v Speaker 3>listening to me on the campaign trail </v>

3389
02:24:21.910 --> 02:24:25.611
<v Speaker 3>because I used to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say things on my podcast or </v>

3390
02:24:25.611 --> 02:24:25.611
<v Speaker 3>tweet something and the next day I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3391
02:24:25.611 --> 02:24:27.200
<v Speaker 3>he'd say something pretty similar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So just like,</v>

3392
02:24:27.510 --> 02:24:29.220
<v Speaker 3>because he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my rhetoric,</v>

3393
02:24:29.221 --> 02:24:29.490
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pete,</v>

3394
02:24:29.550 --> 02:24:31.740
<v Speaker 3>he had to appeal to certain voters that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3395
02:24:31.741 --> 02:24:33.600
<v Speaker 3>and so he was throwing them this type of</v>
<v Speaker 3>red meat.</v>

3396
02:24:33.990 --> 02:24:34.620
<v Speaker 3>But look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

3397
02:24:34.621 --> 02:24:37.440
<v Speaker 3>I know some of the guys that are close </v>
<v Speaker 3>to him,</v>

3398
02:24:37.800 --> 02:24:38.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3399
02:24:38.640 --> 02:24:41.430
<v Speaker 3>like Larry Kudlow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Steve Moore.</v>

3400
02:24:41.610 --> 02:24:42.090
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3401
02:24:42.091 --> 02:24:47.091
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know Steve Moore pretty well at </v>

3402
02:24:47.091 --> 02:24:47.091
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>We speak in a lot of the same things.</v>

3403
02:24:47.091 --> 02:24:48.150
<v Speaker 3>I used to be on Larry's show a lot back </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the day when he used to have his,</v>

3404
02:24:48.420 --> 02:24:50.430
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his show on CNBC.</v>

3405
02:24:50.940 --> 02:24:52.680
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I know some of these guys,</v>

3406
02:24:52.681 --> 02:24:54.180
<v Speaker 3>I don't know her as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

3407
02:24:54.181 --> 02:24:55.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>art laffer,</v>

3408
02:24:55.141 --> 02:25:00.141
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you go look at the debate I did with </v>

3409
02:25:00.141 --> 02:25:00.141
<v Speaker 3>Art Laffer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3410
02:25:00.141 --> 02:25:00.900
<v Speaker 3>in 2006 when he said everything was </v>
<v Speaker 3>great,</v>

3411
02:25:01.170 --> 02:25:02.010
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

3412
02:25:02.011 --> 02:25:04.170
<v Speaker 3>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no recession coming and then he bet me a</v>

3413
02:25:04.171 --> 02:25:05.770
<v Speaker 3>penny and Wellstar on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3414
02:25:05.771 --> 02:25:06.840
<v Speaker 3>if you can't even send.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3415
02:25:06.841 --> 02:25:11.841
<v Speaker 3>well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he bet me a penny that everything was </v>

3416
02:25:11.841 --> 02:25:14.811
<v Speaker 3>great and there was nothing to worry </v>
<v Speaker 3>about and we weren't gonna have a major </v>

3417
02:25:14.811 --> 02:25:15.900
<v Speaker 3>decline and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then he wouldn't even pay up,</v>

3418
02:25:15.980 --> 02:25:17.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but let me ask you this.</v>

3419
02:25:17.191 --> 02:25:19.380
<v Speaker 3>If he calls you up and says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do I do,</v>

3420
02:25:19.500 --> 02:25:20.860
<v Speaker 3>what does he do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3421
02:25:20.880 --> 02:25:21.810
<v Speaker 3>at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

3422
02:25:22.170 --> 02:25:23.680
<v Speaker 3>it would have been better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as I said,</v>

3423
02:25:23.681 --> 02:25:24.010
<v Speaker 3>had he</v>

3424
02:25:24.010 --> 02:25:27.130
<v Speaker 2>come clean right away about what does he</v>
<v Speaker 2>do now?</v>

3425
02:25:27.460 --> 02:25:29.260
<v Speaker 2>Now he's got to have to come back and </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

3426
02:25:29.261 --> 02:25:34.261
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just listened to the Joe Rogan </v>

3427
02:25:34.261 --> 02:25:35.941
<v Speaker 2>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I listened to Peter Schiff and you guys </v>

3428
02:25:35.941 --> 02:25:37.710
<v Speaker 2>guys a genius.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Financial Genius is huge.</v>

3429
02:25:37.810 --> 02:25:40.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a genius.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just have common sense.</v>

3430
02:25:40.810 --> 02:25:42.790
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's these other guys that are just,</v>

3431
02:25:42.960 --> 02:25:43.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

3432
02:25:43.510 --> 02:25:44.320
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're so,</v>

3433
02:25:44.370 --> 02:25:49.370
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their judgment is so clouded by the </v>

3434
02:25:49.370 --> 02:25:49.370
<v Speaker 2>bubble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

3435
02:25:49.370 --> 02:25:52.411
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you get a lot of people that can </v>

3436
02:25:52.411 --> 02:25:52.411
<v Speaker 2>see things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason I saw the crisis coming,</v>

3437
02:25:52.411 --> 02:25:52.510
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3438
02:25:52.570 --> 02:25:54.850
<v Speaker 2>the housing bubble,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't that I was so smart,</v>

3439
02:25:55.090 --> 02:26:00.090
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just thinking clearly everybody </v>

3440
02:26:00.090 --> 02:26:00.090
<v Speaker 2>else was so delusional.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what does he do though?</v>

3441
02:26:00.090 --> 02:26:00.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3442
02:26:00.090 --> 02:26:03.430
<v Speaker 2>so what he's got to do is basically has </v>
<v Speaker 2>got to come clean now and tell the truth</v>

3443
02:26:03.431 --> 02:26:08.431
<v Speaker 2>about how screwed up this country is </v>
<v Speaker 2>after years of big government and after </v>

3444
02:26:08.431 --> 02:26:11.560
<v Speaker 2>years of a central bank that is inflated</v>
<v Speaker 2>bubble after bubble and say,</v>

3445
02:26:11.561 --> 02:26:16.561
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what we need to do to really </v>

3446
02:26:16.561 --> 02:26:16.561
<v Speaker 2>make America great again.</v>

3447
02:26:16.561 --> 02:26:20.540
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to have to shrink </v>

3448
02:26:20.540 --> 02:26:22.021
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I said I wasn't going to cut </v>

3449
02:26:22.021 --> 02:26:22.021
<v Speaker 2>entitlements,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we got to do that.</v>

3450
02:26:22.021 --> 02:26:22.720
<v Speaker 2>We can't afford to make these </v>
<v Speaker 2>commitments.</v>

3451
02:26:22.810 --> 02:26:25.960
<v Speaker 2>We can't pay all of his social security </v>
<v Speaker 2>benefits that have been promised because</v>

3452
02:26:25.961 --> 02:26:28.300
<v Speaker 2>if we try,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to destroy the dollar,</v>

3453
02:26:28.450 --> 02:26:33.450
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if the government tries to give </v>

3454
02:26:33.450 --> 02:26:35.581
<v Speaker 2>everybody a social security check,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can't do it without destroying the </v>

3455
02:26:35.581 --> 02:26:35.581
<v Speaker 2>dollar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we've got to,</v>

3456
02:26:35.581 --> 02:26:38.140
<v Speaker 2>we've got to shrink the program.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've got a means tested program,</v>

3457
02:26:38.290 --> 02:26:40.720
<v Speaker 2>we've got to make it a lot smaller.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got to end it for the future.</v>

3458
02:26:40.780 --> 02:26:45.780
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can't have this intergenerational </v>

3459
02:26:45.780 --> 02:26:45.780
<v Speaker 2>Ponzi scheme,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3460
02:26:45.780 --> 02:26:45.780
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3461
02:26:45.780 --> 02:26:46.960
<v Speaker 2>it was a mistake to create it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3462
02:26:46.961 --> 02:26:51.961
<v Speaker 2>a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody wants to admit that social </v>

3463
02:26:51.961 --> 02:26:51.961
<v Speaker 2>security was a mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Medicare was a mistake.</v>

3464
02:26:51.961 --> 02:26:56.251
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things about social security </v>

3465
02:26:56.251 --> 02:26:56.710
<v Speaker 2>that's been harped on and on is that one</v>
<v Speaker 2>day it's not going to work.</v>

3466
02:26:56.740 --> 02:26:57.550
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't work.</v>

3467
02:26:57.670 --> 02:27:02.670
<v Speaker 2>It's never worked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the idea is that you're paying into </v>

3468
02:27:02.670 --> 02:27:02.670
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

3469
02:27:02.670 --> 02:27:02.670
<v Speaker 2>If you're your 30 year old person paying</v>
<v Speaker 2>into it,</v>

3470
02:27:02.670 --> 02:27:04.540
<v Speaker 2>now this straight on odds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to get it,</v>

3471
02:27:04.541 --> 02:27:06.270
<v Speaker 2>but you're not paying into anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3472
02:27:06.370 --> 02:27:11.370
<v Speaker 2>social security is a Ponzi scheme.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a legitimately funded </v>

3473
02:27:11.370 --> 02:27:12.730
<v Speaker 2>retirement program.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like your social security money</v>

3474
02:27:12.940 --> 02:27:17.020
<v Speaker 2>is putting a real trust funds somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 2>in invested and when you retire,</v>

3475
02:27:17.140 --> 02:27:19.000
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get payments out of this</v>
<v Speaker 2>trust fund.</v>

3476
02:27:19.020 --> 02:27:24.020
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your money is going to the people that </v>

3477
02:27:24.020 --> 02:27:24.020
<v Speaker 2>are spending it right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3478
02:27:24.020 --> 02:27:24.910
<v Speaker 2>and so when it first started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>social security started a long time ago.</v>

3479
02:27:24.911 --> 02:27:29.911
<v Speaker 2>The first woman that got a check was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm more fuller or something was her </v>

3480
02:27:29.911 --> 02:27:30.460
<v Speaker 2>name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she lived to be 100 years old.</v>

3481
02:27:30.820 --> 02:27:35.820
<v Speaker 2>And for her social security was a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a windfall because she paid into it </v>

3482
02:27:35.820 --> 02:27:36.190
<v Speaker 2>for a couple of years.</v>

3483
02:27:36.280 --> 02:27:40.090
<v Speaker 2>She collected for like 40 years and when</v>
<v Speaker 2>full security started,</v>

3484
02:27:40.240 --> 02:27:43.870
<v Speaker 2>it was a one percent tax on payroll and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was only a small amount.</v>

3485
02:27:43.871 --> 02:27:46.870
<v Speaker 2>And then the employer paid one percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which of course comes from the employee.</v>

3486
02:27:47.020 --> 02:27:48.220
<v Speaker 2>That's part of the fraud,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3487
02:27:48.221 --> 02:27:49.870
<v Speaker 2>I mean the employee pays the whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

3488
02:27:50.010 --> 02:27:52.060
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't matter if the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's considered the employer,</v>

3489
02:27:52.240 --> 02:27:53.340
<v Speaker 2>but it didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3490
02:27:53.560 --> 02:27:54.310
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3491
02:27:54.340 --> 02:27:56.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm self employed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People weren't even included.</v>

3492
02:27:56.470 --> 02:27:59.230
<v Speaker 2>I think we didn't include the self </v>
<v Speaker 2>employed until like the fifties,</v>

3493
02:27:59.550 --> 02:28:00.820
<v Speaker 2>Greg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the government figured if you're</v>

3494
02:28:00.821 --> 02:28:05.821
<v Speaker 2>smart enough to run your own business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well then you're smart enough to save </v>

3495
02:28:05.821 --> 02:28:05.821
<v Speaker 2>for your own retirement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3496
02:28:05.821 --> 02:28:06.880
<v Speaker 2>but the government tried to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

3497
02:28:06.881 --> 02:28:09.070
<v Speaker 2>some Americans are not smart enough to </v>
<v Speaker 2>save,</v>

3498
02:28:09.071 --> 02:28:14.071
<v Speaker 2>which I think was a mistake because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>government didn't save anything because </v>

3499
02:28:14.071 --> 02:28:14.440
<v Speaker 2>what the government did is the minute </v>
<v Speaker 2>they got the money,</v>

3500
02:28:14.441 --> 02:28:15.130
<v Speaker 2>they spent it.</v>

3501
02:28:15.670 --> 02:28:20.670
<v Speaker 2>But before they spend it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they write themselves an Iou and they </v>

3502
02:28:20.670 --> 02:28:23.911
<v Speaker 2>call it a trust fund.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See what happens is the government </v>

3503
02:28:23.911 --> 02:28:26.471
<v Speaker 2>collects the social,</v>
<v Speaker 2>social security money and then they </v>

3504
02:28:26.471 --> 02:28:27.950
<v Speaker 2>spend the money on the current </v>
<v Speaker 2>employees,</v>

3505
02:28:28.400 --> 02:28:30.090
<v Speaker 2>but what they don't spend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

3506
02:28:30.091 --> 02:28:30.480
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

3507
02:28:30.540 --> 02:28:35.540
<v Speaker 2>they put into this so called trust fund,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then they borrow it right out and </v>

3508
02:28:35.540 --> 02:28:36.500
<v Speaker 2>they write themselves an iou call the </v>
<v Speaker 2>government bond.</v>

3509
02:28:36.830 --> 02:28:41.830
<v Speaker 2>But if the government owns its own bond,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not an asset because they keep </v>

3510
02:28:41.830 --> 02:28:46.001
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well the trust funds are going to be </v>

3511
02:28:46.001 --> 02:28:46.001
<v Speaker 2>solvent until the year 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>40 or something like that,</v>

3512
02:28:46.001 --> 02:28:50.801
<v Speaker 2>but they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're insolvent right now because </v>

3513
02:28:50.801 --> 02:28:50.990
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing in them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if the government has to tap the</v>

3514
02:28:50.991 --> 02:28:53.900
<v Speaker 2>trust fund,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has to sell a bond to the public,</v>

3515
02:28:54.170 --> 02:28:59.170
<v Speaker 2>which is what it would do if there was </v>
<v Speaker 2>no trust when it's like if you wrote me </v>

3516
02:28:59.170 --> 02:29:01.010
<v Speaker 2>a check for $10,000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3517
02:29:01.580 --> 02:29:03.770
<v Speaker 2>And I had that check.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would be an asset to me.</v>

3518
02:29:03.950 --> 02:29:08.950
<v Speaker 2>If I had your check for $10,000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you wrote yourself a check for </v>

3519
02:29:08.950 --> 02:29:12.431
<v Speaker 2>$10,000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not an asset to you because it's </v>

3520
02:29:12.431 --> 02:29:16.090
<v Speaker 2>an asset and the liability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The same time you owe yourself the </v>

3521
02:29:16.090 --> 02:29:16.090
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if I,</v>

3522
02:29:16.090 --> 02:29:18.350
<v Speaker 2>if I buy a government bond,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I owned the government bond,</v>

3523
02:29:18.470 --> 02:29:22.040
<v Speaker 2>it's an asset to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the government owns its own bond,</v>

3524
02:29:22.070 --> 02:29:23.870
<v Speaker 2>it's not an asset at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>

3525
02:29:23.871 --> 02:29:28.871
<v Speaker 2>It's a liability and asset sales.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the trust funds have been a fiction </v>

3526
02:29:28.871 --> 02:29:33.340
<v Speaker 2>from day one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean Roosevelt sold this to the </v>

3527
02:29:33.340 --> 02:29:33.340
<v Speaker 2>American public.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a con.</v>

3528
02:29:33.340 --> 02:29:35.780
<v Speaker 2>That's why they call it social security </v>
<v Speaker 2>contributions.</v>

3529
02:29:35.960 --> 02:29:38.750
<v Speaker 2>They call it you're paying premiums.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a trust.</v>

3530
02:29:38.900 --> 02:29:41.270
<v Speaker 2>They tried to make it sound like </v>
<v Speaker 2>legitimate insurance,</v>

3531
02:29:41.390 --> 02:29:46.390
<v Speaker 2>but it was never legitimate insurance </v>
<v Speaker 2>because that would have actually been </v>

3532
02:29:46.390 --> 02:29:46.390
<v Speaker 2>unconstitutional.</v>

3533
02:29:46.390 --> 02:29:49.900
<v Speaker 2>The reason that the supreme court said </v>
<v Speaker 2>social security was constitutional was </v>

3534
02:29:49.900 --> 02:29:50.210
<v Speaker 2>because it wasn't legitimate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>

3535
02:29:50.211 --> 02:29:55.211
<v Speaker 2>They said it was like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just like any other welfare </v>

3536
02:29:55.211 --> 02:29:55.211
<v Speaker 2>programs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3537
02:29:55.211 --> 02:29:55.310
<v Speaker 2>We went off on a deep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's wants you to bring back though,</v>

3538
02:29:55.311 --> 02:29:57.410
<v Speaker 2>because we're getting off track.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really want you to say,</v>

3539
02:29:57.411 --> 02:29:59.540
<v Speaker 2>what would you tell them to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3540
02:29:59.570 --> 02:30:02.900
<v Speaker 2>So social security limit entitlements or</v>
<v Speaker 2>eliminate them.</v>

3541
02:30:03.020 --> 02:30:08.020
<v Speaker 2>We've got to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got to start eliminating lots of </v>

3542
02:30:08.020 --> 02:30:09.770
<v Speaker 2>government agencies and departments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether it's education,</v>

3543
02:30:09.780 --> 02:30:14.780
<v Speaker 2>energy mean they're all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all sorts of government </v>

3544
02:30:14.780 --> 02:30:17.081
<v Speaker 2>departments that we need to abolish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to cut back on government </v>

3545
02:30:17.081 --> 02:30:17.081
<v Speaker 2>spending,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to economize,</v>

3546
02:30:17.081 --> 02:30:20.360
<v Speaker 2>we need to make government as lean as </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible because we're broke.</v>

3547
02:30:20.660 --> 02:30:21.650
<v Speaker 2>Government is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3548
02:30:21.770 --> 02:30:26.770
<v Speaker 2>it's like if you're trying to run a </v>
<v Speaker 2>marathon and you've got a 50 pound sack </v>

3549
02:30:26.770 --> 02:30:26.770
<v Speaker 2>on your back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3550
02:30:26.770 --> 02:30:27.770
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to run very fast.</v>

3551
02:30:27.770 --> 02:30:31.280
<v Speaker 2>The secret is to take some of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>weight out of the pack.</v>

3552
02:30:31.400 --> 02:30:36.400
<v Speaker 2>So you think that limiting government </v>
<v Speaker 2>and getting rid of all the spending is </v>

3553
02:30:36.400 --> 02:30:39.140
<v Speaker 2>going to allow the economy to be more </v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful.</v>

3554
02:30:39.350 --> 02:30:42.920
<v Speaker 2>But yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but initially we know it's like if,</v>

3555
02:30:43.140 --> 02:30:48.140
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to train somebody to </v>

3556
02:30:48.140 --> 02:30:48.690
<v Speaker 2>come into your gym and they come in and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're real fat and they're,</v>

3557
02:30:48.720 --> 02:30:49.110
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

3558
02:30:49.120 --> 02:30:50.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're adequate,</v>

3559
02:30:50.090 --> 02:30:52.160
<v Speaker 2>they're overweight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have a lousy diet,</v>

3560
02:30:52.161 --> 02:30:53.210
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you say,</v>

3561
02:30:53.211 --> 02:30:58.211
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got a plan for you that's going to </v>

3562
02:30:58.211 --> 02:30:59.650
<v Speaker 2>get you into shape in the short run.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not going to like that plan.</v>

3563
02:30:59.840 --> 02:31:02.510
<v Speaker 2>They can't eat their favorite foods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to be,</v>

3564
02:31:02.590 --> 02:31:07.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting up early and training and so </v>

3565
02:31:07.590 --> 02:31:09.940
<v Speaker 2>their lifestyle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to be as enjoyable to </v>

3566
02:31:09.940 --> 02:31:09.940
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to.</v>

3567
02:31:09.940 --> 02:31:09.940
<v Speaker 2>There's going to be all this pain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3568
02:31:10.070 --> 02:31:13.190
<v Speaker 2>So in order to do the right thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying there's a panacea,</v>

3569
02:31:13.430 --> 02:31:15.740
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>In order to fix the economy,</v>

3570
02:31:16.160 --> 02:31:18.770
<v Speaker 2>we are going to have to go through a </v>
<v Speaker 2>recession,</v>

3571
02:31:18.771 --> 02:31:19.980
<v Speaker 2>a very bad one</v>

3572
02:31:19.980 --> 02:31:24.980
<v Speaker 3>in order to reallocate resources to </v>
<v Speaker 3>where they need to be to let the free </v>

3573
02:31:24.980 --> 02:31:29.511
<v Speaker 3>market reallocate them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when the government gets out of the </v>

3574
02:31:29.511 --> 02:31:31.911
<v Speaker 3>way and starts shrinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people who were getting </v>

3575
02:31:31.911 --> 02:31:32.610
<v Speaker 3>government checks are not going to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>those checks.</v>

3576
02:31:33.060 --> 02:31:36.270
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people who had government jobs </v>
<v Speaker 3>are not going to have jobs.</v>

3577
02:31:36.360 --> 02:31:39.090
<v Speaker 3>They're going to have to get productive </v>
<v Speaker 3>jobs in the private sector.</v>

3578
02:31:39.150 --> 02:31:40.710
<v Speaker 3>So there's going to be some transition </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

3579
02:31:40.910 --> 02:31:45.910
<v Speaker 3>We're going to also have to get rid of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of regulations that make it so </v>

3580
02:31:45.910 --> 02:31:47.130
<v Speaker 3>difficult and expensive to hire people </v>
<v Speaker 3>and train people.</v>

3581
02:31:47.190 --> 02:31:49.650
<v Speaker 3>So we have to downsize government.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>

3582
02:31:49.651 --> 02:31:53.190
<v Speaker 3>they said we have to let interest rates </v>
<v Speaker 3>go up so that people will save.</v>

3583
02:31:53.280 --> 02:31:58.280
<v Speaker 3>So that entrepreneurs can get the </v>
<v Speaker 3>capital they need to make the </v>

3584
02:31:58.280 --> 02:31:59.550
<v Speaker 3>investments to make the tools that their</v>
<v Speaker 3>workers need to be more productive.</v>

3585
02:31:59.880 --> 02:32:02.190
<v Speaker 3>But then we have to let asset prices </v>
<v Speaker 3>fall.</v>

3586
02:32:02.280 --> 02:32:05.280
<v Speaker 3>We have to stop trying to create this </v>
<v Speaker 3>phony wealth effects.</v>

3587
02:32:05.281 --> 02:32:10.281
<v Speaker 3>Either the central bank thinks what we </v>
<v Speaker 3>need is to make the stock market go up </v>

3588
02:32:10.281 --> 02:32:11.520
<v Speaker 3>and then people will think they're rich </v>
<v Speaker 3>and go out and spend money.</v>

3589
02:32:11.820 --> 02:32:14.250
<v Speaker 3>Stocks are not supposed to be the stock </v>
<v Speaker 3>price.</v>

3590
02:32:14.251 --> 02:32:16.830
<v Speaker 3>Appreciation is not supposed to be the </v>
<v Speaker 3>source of wealth.</v>

3591
02:32:17.010 --> 02:32:22.010
<v Speaker 3>It's companies becoming more valuable </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they're earning more in </v>

3592
02:32:22.010 --> 02:32:25.681
<v Speaker 3>producing more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's supposed to make the price go up </v>

3593
02:32:25.681 --> 02:32:25.681
<v Speaker 3>there trying to put the cart before the </v>
<v Speaker 3>horse.</v>

3594
02:32:25.681 --> 02:32:28.860
<v Speaker 3>They think that just making the stock </v>
<v Speaker 3>market go up is going to make us richer.</v>

3595
02:32:28.900 --> 02:32:29.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3596
02:32:29.240 --> 02:32:31.230
<v Speaker 4>So in your opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>deregulation,</v>

3597
02:32:31.231 --> 02:32:36.231
<v Speaker 4>smaller business,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all these things are going to help </v>

3598
02:32:36.231 --> 02:32:38.000
<v Speaker 4>letting people know that the god that we</v>
<v Speaker 4>are fucked and that this is this,</v>

3599
02:32:38.120 --> 02:32:43.120
<v Speaker 4>this whole.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The economy's doing great thing is a </v>

3600
02:32:43.120 --> 02:32:43.120
<v Speaker 4>route.</v>

3601
02:32:43.120 --> 02:32:45.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of people who are not working </v>

3602
02:32:45.520 --> 02:32:45.520
<v Speaker 3>half the start working,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they got to start doing stuff.</v>

3603
02:32:45.520 --> 02:32:46.710
<v Speaker 3>We got to get people off of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3604
02:32:46.730 --> 02:32:48.830
<v Speaker 3>the Dole and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and start and you know,</v>

3605
02:32:48.831 --> 02:32:49.190
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

3606
02:32:49.191 --> 02:32:49.670
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

3607
02:32:49.671 --> 02:32:54.671
<v Speaker 3>they're riding into wagon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They got to start pulling it like </v>

3608
02:32:54.671 --> 02:32:54.671
<v Speaker 3>everybody else</v>

3609
02:32:54.671 --> 02:32:55.970
<v Speaker 4>and you think smaller government and </v>
<v Speaker 4>less regulation is going to enhance</v>

3610
02:32:56.050 --> 02:33:01.050
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's what's keeping them from </v>

3611
02:33:01.050 --> 02:33:01.050
<v Speaker 3>getting jobs in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

3612
02:33:01.050 --> 02:33:04.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they make it hard for you to get a job </v>

3613
02:33:04.560 --> 02:33:06.870
<v Speaker 3>with rules and regulations and taxes and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then they reward you for not working </v>

3614
02:33:06.870 --> 02:33:07.420
<v Speaker 3>with all sorts of subsidies</v>

3615
02:33:07.600 --> 02:33:09.330
<v Speaker 4>programs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean end.</v>

3616
02:33:09.450 --> 02:33:14.050
<v Speaker 4>There's also a fear of automation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Automation is going to eliminate a large</v>

3617
02:33:14.051 --> 02:33:16.060
<v Speaker 4>amount of jobs including driving jobs.</v>

3618
02:33:16.120 --> 02:33:16.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

3619
02:33:17.020 --> 02:33:20.080
<v Speaker 3>that's all gonna make us richer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we've had automation,</v>

3620
02:33:20.290 --> 02:33:22.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>since the industrial revolution,</v>

3621
02:33:22.151 --> 02:33:24.610
<v Speaker 3>but even before that there was </v>
<v Speaker 3>automation.</v>

3622
02:33:24.611 --> 02:33:26.050
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at people on the farms,</v>

3623
02:33:26.051 --> 02:33:28.040
<v Speaker 3>look at how many people don't work on </v>
<v Speaker 3>farms</v>

3624
02:33:28.110 --> 02:33:33.110
<v Speaker 4>now because we have machines,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but people are worried about universal </v>

3625
02:33:33.110 --> 02:33:34.780
<v Speaker 4>basic income that this is the only </v>
<v Speaker 4>solution for solution</v>

3626
02:33:34.960 --> 02:33:39.960
<v Speaker 3>automation makes us wealthier as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>society because it eliminates work.</v>

3627
02:33:41.530 --> 02:33:45.220
<v Speaker 3>Work is not an end in and of itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Work is a means to an ends.</v>

3628
02:33:45.310 --> 02:33:48.730
<v Speaker 3>Nobody wants to work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want the fruits of the labor and so</v>

3629
02:33:48.731 --> 02:33:51.460
<v Speaker 3>to the extent that we can have a machine</v>
<v Speaker 3>do the work for us,</v>

3630
02:33:51.760 --> 02:33:54.160
<v Speaker 3>that frees us up to do other things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

3631
02:33:54.180 --> 02:33:57.820
<v Speaker 3>if we have autonomous cars and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to drive anymore,</v>

3632
02:33:58.120 --> 02:34:03.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a trump won't have that problem being </v>

3633
02:34:03.120 --> 02:34:04.390
<v Speaker 3>sued for overtime by his ex driver </v>
<v Speaker 3>because he won't need somebody to drive.</v>

3634
02:34:04.391 --> 02:34:08.050
<v Speaker 3>But imagine if everybody had a self </v>
<v Speaker 3>driving car.</v>

3635
02:34:08.140 --> 02:34:10.180
<v Speaker 3>Think of all the free time now that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have,</v>

3636
02:34:10.181 --> 02:34:12.130
<v Speaker 3>you can work while you're in your car or</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can,</v>

3637
02:34:12.280 --> 02:34:17.280
<v Speaker 3>you can do other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could watch a movie while you're in </v>

3638
02:34:17.280 --> 02:34:17.280
<v Speaker 3>the car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you won't be dreading a long trip</v>

3639
02:34:17.280 --> 02:34:18.040
<v Speaker 3>because you'll be to be productive</v>

3640
02:34:18.280 --> 02:34:20.620
<v Speaker 2>while you're in there in that car and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

3641
02:34:20.621 --> 02:34:22.150
<v Speaker 2>So there's a lot of things that will </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

3642
02:34:22.151 --> 02:34:24.280
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll eliminate truck driver jobs,</v>

3643
02:34:24.760 --> 02:34:25.350
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll,</v>

3644
02:34:25.351 --> 02:34:26.890
<v Speaker 2>we'll have safer streets and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3645
02:34:26.891 --> 02:34:27.280
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3646
02:34:27.520 --> 02:34:29.830
<v Speaker 2>and it'll be less expensive to transport</v>
<v Speaker 2>goods.</v>

3647
02:34:30.040 --> 02:34:35.040
<v Speaker 2>But that frees up that worker to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>something else with their time now that </v>

3648
02:34:35.040 --> 02:34:38.740
<v Speaker 2>they don't have the drive that truck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the idea of universal basic income is</v>

3649
02:34:38.741 --> 02:34:43.741
<v Speaker 2>the only solution that isn't appealing </v>
<v Speaker 2>to you because you think that they </v>

3650
02:34:43.741 --> 02:34:47.160
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The real solution is not to give them </v>

3651
02:34:47.160 --> 02:34:49.441
<v Speaker 2>free money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The real solution is for them to find </v>

3652
02:34:49.441 --> 02:34:50.560
<v Speaker 2>something else to do the the physical </v>
<v Speaker 2>attributes of the appeal.</v>

3653
02:34:50.770 --> 02:34:54.190
<v Speaker 2>The appeal of universal basic income is </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost like two wrongs make a right.</v>

3654
02:34:54.191 --> 02:34:59.191
<v Speaker 2>I mean the problem is the welfare state </v>
<v Speaker 2>discourages people from working at the </v>

3655
02:34:59.321 --> 02:35:04.321
<v Speaker 2>highest marginal tax rate that anybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>pays is going from welfare to work.</v>

3656
02:35:04.660 --> 02:35:07.540
<v Speaker 2>Because not only do you pay the taxes on</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you earn,</v>

3657
02:35:07.810 --> 02:35:10.660
<v Speaker 2>but you lose all the benefits because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you now have a job.</v>

3658
02:35:10.840 --> 02:35:15.820
<v Speaker 2>So welfare and the welfare state creates</v>
<v Speaker 2>a huge incentive for people not to work.</v>

3659
02:35:16.090 --> 02:35:18.760
<v Speaker 2>So at least the argument with universal </v>
<v Speaker 2>income is,</v>

3660
02:35:18.761 --> 02:35:23.761
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to take away your </v>

3661
02:35:23.761 --> 02:35:23.761
<v Speaker 2>welfare if you get a job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you improve your lot in life,</v>

3662
02:35:23.761 --> 02:35:24.970
<v Speaker 2>if you go out there and you become </v>
<v Speaker 2>productive,</v>

3663
02:35:24.971 --> 02:35:27.940
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to punish you by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3664
02:35:27.990 --> 02:35:29.860
<v Speaker 2>by taking away your welfare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3665
02:35:30.010 --> 02:35:33.130
<v Speaker 2>the better answer is let's not punish </v>
<v Speaker 2>you for working.</v>

3666
02:35:33.280 --> 02:35:36.580
<v Speaker 2>Let's get rid of the income tax.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's not tax labor.</v>

3667
02:35:36.581 --> 02:35:39.430
<v Speaker 2>Let's get rid of the payroll tax to make</v>
<v Speaker 2>it more.</v>

3668
02:35:39.431 --> 02:35:42.040
<v Speaker 2>You ever foresee getting rid of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>income tax?</v>

3669
02:35:42.050 --> 02:35:42.790
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this country,</v>

3670
02:35:42.800 --> 02:35:47.800
<v Speaker 2>and yet we didn't have it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but since the 19 forties when it was </v>

3671
02:35:48.611 --> 02:35:53.611
<v Speaker 2>introduced in 1913,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but nobody really paid it until 1943 </v>

3672
02:35:53.611 --> 02:35:55.330
<v Speaker 2>when we had the withholding tax.</v>

3673
02:35:55.330 --> 02:35:58.570
<v Speaker 2>But we could get rid of the income tax.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really think that that would ever fly in</v>

3674
02:35:58.571 --> 02:36:00.240
<v Speaker 2>this country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope so.</v>

3675
02:36:00.241 --> 02:36:02.020
<v Speaker 2>When people are so addicted to that </v>
<v Speaker 2>money,</v>

3676
02:36:02.500 --> 02:36:03.430
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people don't.</v>

3677
02:36:03.431 --> 02:36:08.431
<v Speaker 2>People don't like paying the income tax,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we can't get rid of the income tax </v>

3678
02:36:08.431 --> 02:36:12.181
<v Speaker 2>unless we shrink government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean back in 1900 government was only </v>

3679
02:36:12.181 --> 02:36:13.240
<v Speaker 2>like five percent of the GNP.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All Levels,</v>

3680
02:36:13.241 --> 02:36:14.230
<v Speaker 2>state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>federal and local.</v>

3681
02:36:14.320 --> 02:36:19.320
<v Speaker 2>Now it's like 40 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we can't have no income tax and no </v>

3682
02:36:19.320 --> 02:36:20.980
<v Speaker 2>payroll tax.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we want to have all this government,</v>

3683
02:36:21.220 --> 02:36:23.080
<v Speaker 2>but if we're willing to do without the </v>
<v Speaker 2>government,</v>

3684
02:36:23.081 --> 02:36:24.870
<v Speaker 2>then we don't need the taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if we don't,</v>

3685
02:36:24.890 --> 02:36:27.910
<v Speaker 2>most of this government is ineffective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>

3686
02:36:27.911 --> 02:36:28.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3687
02:36:28.900 --> 02:36:30.420
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's always inefficient.</v>

3688
02:36:30.430 --> 02:36:34.390
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a necessary evil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's why you want to minimize.</v>

3689
02:36:34.391 --> 02:36:38.320
<v Speaker 2>So what would you want to keep power?</v>

3690
02:36:38.350 --> 02:36:41.620
<v Speaker 2>Maintaining streets?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things about maintenance.</v>

3691
02:36:41.680 --> 02:36:43.870
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know these on a federal level.</v>

3692
02:36:44.300 --> 02:36:49.300
<v Speaker 2>Education,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both the federal government should not </v>

3693
02:36:49.300 --> 02:36:51.691
<v Speaker 2>be involved in education at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in fact if you look at the </v>

3694
02:36:51.691 --> 02:36:51.920
<v Speaker 2>constitution to get the word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>education is not mentioned.</v>

3695
02:36:51.990 --> 02:36:56.400
<v Speaker 2>The school is not meant all had buggies </v>
<v Speaker 2>back then and they were feathers,</v>

3696
02:36:56.410 --> 02:36:58.210
<v Speaker 2>but they had schools.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They knew what they were.</v>

3697
02:36:58.211 --> 02:37:03.211
<v Speaker 2>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so how do you fund education and the </v>

3698
02:37:03.211 --> 02:37:05.941
<v Speaker 2>department that the Department of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Education didn't even exist until what </v>

3699
02:37:05.941 --> 02:37:05.941
<v Speaker 2>we did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was it in the sixties?</v>

3700
02:37:05.941 --> 02:37:07.270
<v Speaker 2>I forget when they started it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but look,</v>

3701
02:37:07.510 --> 02:37:12.510
<v Speaker 2>the federal government should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>involved primarily with external </v>

3702
02:37:12.510 --> 02:37:14.410
<v Speaker 2>matters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we should have a national defense.</v>

3703
02:37:14.440 --> 02:37:15.920
<v Speaker 2>I think it should much smaller.</v>

3704
02:37:16.070 --> 02:37:19.100
<v Speaker 3>I think that we spend more money than we</v>
<v Speaker 3>need on the military.</v>

3705
02:37:19.280 --> 02:37:22.250
<v Speaker 3>I think we could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we could have a defensive military for a</v>

3706
02:37:22.251 --> 02:37:27.251
<v Speaker 3>fraction of what we currently pay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think the federal government </v>

3707
02:37:27.251 --> 02:37:28.760
<v Speaker 3>should be predominantly focused on </v>
<v Speaker 3>external matters,</v>

3708
02:37:29.250 --> 02:37:34.250
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the extent that we're going to have </v>

3709
02:37:34.250 --> 02:37:34.250
<v Speaker 3>public education or government spending </v>
<v Speaker 3>money on the schools,</v>

3710
02:37:34.250 --> 02:37:35.960
<v Speaker 3>let them do it on a state level or local</v>
<v Speaker 3>level.</v>

3711
02:37:35.961 --> 02:37:36.410
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3712
02:37:36.470 --> 02:37:39.290
<v Speaker 3>it should not be done at the federal </v>
<v Speaker 3>level,</v>

3713
02:37:39.380 --> 02:37:44.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are issues that can be the manage </v>

3714
02:37:44.380 --> 02:37:44.380
<v Speaker 3>by stats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the state tax money.</v>

3715
02:37:44.380 --> 02:37:45.040
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

3716
02:37:45.380 --> 02:37:49.010
<v Speaker 3>see what happens now is everybody sends </v>
<v Speaker 3>all this money to the federal government</v>

3717
02:37:49.011 --> 02:37:50.510
<v Speaker 3>and then they beg to get some of it </v>
<v Speaker 3>back,</v>

3718
02:37:50.511 --> 02:37:52.340
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have state aid where you send money</v>

3719
02:37:52.341 --> 02:37:57.341
<v Speaker 3>out and you try to get some of it back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just don't send it to Washington in the </v>

3720
02:37:57.341 --> 02:37:57.341
<v Speaker 3>first place.</v>

3721
02:37:57.341 --> 02:38:01.030
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at the five richest counties in </v>

3722
02:38:01.030 --> 02:38:01.030
<v Speaker 3>America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They all surround Washington DC.</v>

3723
02:38:01.030 --> 02:38:02.840
<v Speaker 3>It's all the lobby lobbyists where all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the power is.</v>

3724
02:38:02.841 --> 02:38:04.220
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we got to get rid of that.</v>

3725
02:38:04.221 --> 02:38:05.870
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the federal government is like a cancer,</v>

3726
02:38:06.280 --> 02:38:06.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have,</v>

3727
02:38:06.831 --> 02:38:11.831
<v Speaker 3>we know we now we were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we got a new nominee for the supreme </v>

3728
02:38:11.831 --> 02:38:11.831
<v Speaker 3>court.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Talk about,</v>

3729
02:38:11.831 --> 02:38:11.831
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>

3730
02:38:11.831 --> 02:38:14.630
<v Speaker 3>but nobody really talks about the role </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the constitution.</v>

3731
02:38:14.631 --> 02:38:15.210
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3732
02:38:15.250 --> 02:38:20.250
<v Speaker 3>are we going to repeal roe versus Wade </v>
<v Speaker 3>is if the most important thing is </v>

3733
02:38:20.250 --> 02:38:20.510
<v Speaker 3>whether or not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3734
02:38:20.511 --> 02:38:22.090
<v Speaker 3>there's this federal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3735
02:38:22.340 --> 02:38:27.340
<v Speaker 3>abortion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The important part of the constitution </v>

3736
02:38:27.340 --> 02:38:28.550
<v Speaker 3>is that it is the law that applies to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the government.</v>

3737
02:38:28.910 --> 02:38:33.910
<v Speaker 3>It limits the power of government.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thomas Jefferson said that we will bind </v>

3738
02:38:33.910 --> 02:38:38.261
<v Speaker 3>up the con,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the government in the chains of the </v>

3739
02:38:38.261 --> 02:38:40.511
<v Speaker 3>constitution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But at this point the government does </v>

3740
02:38:40.511 --> 02:38:40.511
<v Speaker 3>whatever it wants.</v>

3741
02:38:40.511 --> 02:38:41.990
<v Speaker 3>The government is not abiding by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>law.</v>

3742
02:38:42.050 --> 02:38:44.900
<v Speaker 3>I mean they try to pretend that we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>interpreting the constitution.</v>

3743
02:38:45.260 --> 02:38:50.260
<v Speaker 3>It's not up for interpretation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The constitution is not written in </v>

3744
02:38:50.260 --> 02:38:50.420
<v Speaker 3>Chinese.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to interpret it,</v>

3745
02:38:50.480 --> 02:38:55.480
<v Speaker 3>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the government likes to talk about </v>

3746
02:38:55.480 --> 02:38:55.480
<v Speaker 3>interpreting the constitution because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they want to ignore it.</v>

3747
02:38:55.480 --> 02:38:59.390
<v Speaker 3>They want to do all sorts of things that</v>
<v Speaker 3>are not authorized by the constitution.</v>

3748
02:38:59.391 --> 02:39:03.770
<v Speaker 3>The constitution only authorizes a few </v>
<v Speaker 3>powers to the federal government.</v>

3749
02:39:03.771 --> 02:39:08.771
<v Speaker 3>There are enumerated in the constitution</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the Constitution doesn't say the </v>

3750
02:39:08.771 --> 02:39:08.771
<v Speaker 3>government can do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can't do it,</v>

3751
02:39:08.771 --> 02:39:12.230
<v Speaker 3>and almost everything that government </v>
<v Speaker 3>does today is unconstitutional,</v>

3752
02:39:12.231 --> 02:39:15.080
<v Speaker 3>is doing so that it has no constantly </v>
<v Speaker 3>authority to do.</v>

3753
02:39:15.230 --> 02:39:17.360
<v Speaker 3>And that's what we need a supreme court </v>
<v Speaker 3>for him.</v>

3754
02:39:17.361 --> 02:39:21.020
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of people don't like Congress,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very low opinion of Congress.</v>

3755
02:39:21.130 --> 02:39:22.940
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people don't necessarily like </v>
<v Speaker 3>the president,</v>

3756
02:39:23.120 --> 02:39:24.770
<v Speaker 3>but everybody loves the judiciary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3757
02:39:24.770 --> 02:39:26.960
<v Speaker 3>We have three branches of government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the executive,</v>

3758
02:39:27.230 --> 02:39:30.530
<v Speaker 3>the legislature and the judiciary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and everybody likes to judiciary,</v>

3759
02:39:30.680 --> 02:39:35.680
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's the judiciary that has </v>
<v Speaker 3>sold us out the most because they have </v>

3760
02:39:35.680 --> 02:39:39.071
<v Speaker 3>let the government get away with murder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are not enforcing the law on the </v>

3761
02:39:39.071 --> 02:39:39.930
<v Speaker 3>government and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

3762
02:39:39.940 --> 02:39:42.530
<v Speaker 3>and making the government abide by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>law.</v>

3763
02:39:42.531 --> 02:39:46.250
<v Speaker 3>I mean the laws that apply to me and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>are up for interpretation,</v>

3764
02:39:46.340 --> 02:39:47.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they mean what they say,</v>

3765
02:39:48.080 --> 02:39:53.080
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But somehow the laws that apply to the </v>

3766
02:39:53.080 --> 02:39:53.080
<v Speaker 3>government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3767
02:39:53.080 --> 02:39:53.080
<v Speaker 3>will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can be interpreted,</v>

3768
02:39:53.080 --> 02:39:53.780
<v Speaker 3>which means they can be ignored,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3769
02:39:53.781 --> 02:39:54.410
<v Speaker 3>They want to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3770
02:39:54.411 --> 02:39:58.010
<v Speaker 3>the constitution is a living,</v>
<v Speaker 3>breathing document so that it can change</v>

3771
02:39:58.011 --> 02:40:00.620
<v Speaker 3>with the times is a way of saying it </v>
<v Speaker 3>means nothing,</v>

3772
02:40:00.980 --> 02:40:05.980
<v Speaker 3>so we need to reclaim the republic by </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually forcing the government to live </v>

3773
02:40:06.350 --> 02:40:08.690
<v Speaker 3>by the constitution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the things trump can do is</v>

3774
02:40:08.691 --> 02:40:09.110
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

3775
02:40:09.350 --> 02:40:13.560
<v Speaker 3>we're going to restore constitutional </v>
<v Speaker 3>government to this republic.</v>

3776
02:40:13.820 --> 02:40:14.070
<v Speaker 3>We</v>

3777
02:40:14.070 --> 02:40:19.070
<v Speaker 2>are going to make sure that government </v>
<v Speaker 2>only does what it's authorized to doing </v>

3778
02:40:19.070 --> 02:40:21.090
<v Speaker 2>the constitution and the smaller you </v>
<v Speaker 2>make government,</v>

3779
02:40:21.091 --> 02:40:22.580
<v Speaker 2>the freer you make people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3780
02:40:22.650 --> 02:40:25.080
<v Speaker 2>That's what it's all about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said earlier in the podcast about this</v>

3781
02:40:25.081 --> 02:40:30.081
<v Speaker 2>whole idea about group privileged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The more privileges that you give </v>

3782
02:40:30.081 --> 02:40:33.621
<v Speaker 2>groups,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fewer rights that you have for </v>

3783
02:40:33.621 --> 02:40:33.621
<v Speaker 2>individuals and the more government you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>

3784
02:40:33.621 --> 02:40:38.330
<v Speaker 2>the less free we are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's the actually the real </v>

3785
02:40:38.330 --> 02:40:40.911
<v Speaker 2>definition of freedom is freedom from </v>
<v Speaker 2>government and so the smaller </v>

3786
02:40:40.911 --> 02:40:42.420
<v Speaker 2>government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the less they regulate your activity,</v>

3787
02:40:42.700 --> 02:40:44.880
<v Speaker 2>the the and the less money they take </v>
<v Speaker 2>from you,</v>

3788
02:40:44.970 --> 02:40:47.910
<v Speaker 2>the more freedom you have and the more </v>
<v Speaker 2>free we are,</v>

3789
02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:50.370
<v Speaker 2>the more freely we can interact with one</v>
<v Speaker 2>another,</v>

3790
02:40:50.640 --> 02:40:53.070
<v Speaker 2>the more prosperous we're going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

3791
02:40:53.130 --> 02:40:56.670
<v Speaker 2>second step,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does a person like me do to stop or</v>

3792
02:40:56.671 --> 02:40:58.530
<v Speaker 2>to mitigate the effects of this bubble?</v>

3793
02:40:58.530 --> 02:40:59.880
<v Speaker 2>That's gonna crash.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3794
02:40:59.940 --> 02:41:00.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I said,</v>

3795
02:41:00.450 --> 02:41:05.450
<v Speaker 2>the only thing you can do personally </v>
<v Speaker 2>because politically there's really very </v>

3796
02:41:05.450 --> 02:41:05.670
<v Speaker 2>little we can do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's gonna hit the fan,</v>

3797
02:41:05.700 --> 02:41:10.700
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's nothing we can do about </v>

3798
02:41:10.700 --> 02:41:10.700
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3799
02:41:10.700 --> 02:41:13.220
<v Speaker 2>because trump's not going to call me </v>
<v Speaker 2>down to the White House and they will </v>

3800
02:41:13.220 --> 02:41:13.220
<v Speaker 2>add to this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Peter,</v>

3801
02:41:13.700 --> 02:41:18.700
<v Speaker 2>I love on the Joe Rogan podcast even </v>
<v Speaker 2>though sometimes he touched shit about </v>

3802
02:41:18.700 --> 02:41:18.700
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that little weasel,</v>

3803
02:41:18.700 --> 02:41:23.690
<v Speaker 2>you know I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was his biggest defender after the </v>

3804
02:41:23.690 --> 02:41:24.070
<v Speaker 2>access Hollywood stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was on podcast.</v>

3805
02:41:24.071 --> 02:41:29.071
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I defended him when nobody would defend </v>

3806
02:41:29.071 --> 02:41:31.521
<v Speaker 2>them for that because I understood those</v>
<v Speaker 2>comments and how and what he was doing </v>

3807
02:41:31.521 --> 02:41:31.880
<v Speaker 2>and I called everybody talking shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3808
02:41:31.890 --> 02:41:36.890
<v Speaker 2>he look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was just being a guy with other guys </v>

3809
02:41:36.890 --> 02:41:36.890
<v Speaker 2>and he didn't know he was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't know he was being.</v>

3810
02:41:36.890 --> 02:41:38.070
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't saying that for public </v>
<v Speaker 2>consumption.</v>

3811
02:41:38.070 --> 02:41:43.070
<v Speaker 2>Imagine saying something funny and my </v>
<v Speaker 2>friends have said horrible things to me </v>

3812
02:41:43.070 --> 02:41:43.070
<v Speaker 2>and I've laughed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3813
02:41:43.070 --> 02:41:45.600
<v Speaker 2>And of course the thing that billy billy</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bush got in trouble for sitting next to.</v>

3814
02:41:45.601 --> 02:41:46.860
<v Speaker 2>I know laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't.</v>

3815
02:41:46.870 --> 02:41:49.200
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't like taking a stand.</v>

3816
02:41:49.350 --> 02:41:54.350
<v Speaker 2>He's in a broadcast next to a guy who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>a crazy person who is literally known </v>

3817
02:41:54.350 --> 02:41:56.520
<v Speaker 2>for being a crazy person saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>outrageous stuff.</v>

3818
02:41:56.670 --> 02:41:58.830
<v Speaker 2>His tagline is your fire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3819
02:41:58.831 --> 02:42:03.831
<v Speaker 2>you know some of the stuff that women </v>
<v Speaker 2>say about guys when they're just </v>

3820
02:42:03.831 --> 02:42:03.831
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Women chatting.</v>

3821
02:42:03.831 --> 02:42:06.690
<v Speaker 2>I mean it looks so what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But now I forgot your question about,</v>

3822
02:42:06.800 --> 02:42:07.590
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do we fix?</v>

3823
02:42:07.620 --> 02:42:09.850
<v Speaker 2>How do we personally me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3824
02:42:10.310 --> 02:42:11.150
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not,</v>

3825
02:42:11.580 --> 02:42:16.580
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to prevent it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I am hoping like you and people </v>

3826
02:42:16.580 --> 02:42:20.511
<v Speaker 2>like me after it collapses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that if we can at least come out there </v>

3827
02:42:20.511 --> 02:42:22.800
<v Speaker 2>with an alternative version of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened,</v>

3828
02:42:22.801 --> 02:42:24.600
<v Speaker 2>like after the financial crisis </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>

3829
02:42:24.900 --> 02:42:27.300
<v Speaker 2>And I was one of the few people saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

3830
02:42:27.610 --> 02:42:29.070
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't the banks,</v>

3831
02:42:29.071 --> 02:42:31.140
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't greed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was government.</v>

3832
02:42:31.141 --> 02:42:33.660
<v Speaker 2>It was the Federal Reserve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.</v>

3833
02:42:33.720 --> 02:42:37.410
<v Speaker 2>They were the problem right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the government got away with blaming</v>

3834
02:42:37.411 --> 02:42:42.411
<v Speaker 2>capitalism and making government bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we need to do and what you can do </v>

3835
02:42:42.411 --> 02:42:43.830
<v Speaker 2>with your audience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is much bigger than mine,</v>

3836
02:42:44.220 --> 02:42:49.220
<v Speaker 2>is when it hits the fan again to put the</v>
<v Speaker 2>blame where it belongs on government and</v>

3837
02:42:49.861 --> 02:42:54.861
<v Speaker 2>state government did this to us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not an accident that we have all </v>

3838
02:42:54.861 --> 02:42:58.221
<v Speaker 2>this government and we have all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems and you know it's government </v>

3839
02:42:58.221 --> 02:42:58.980
<v Speaker 2>interference in capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the problem,</v>

3840
02:42:59.070 --> 02:43:01.470
<v Speaker 2>not capitalism itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the government stayed out,</v>

3841
02:43:01.471 --> 02:43:06.471
<v Speaker 2>it would be working beautifully,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we don't want to throw the baby out </v>

3842
02:43:06.471 --> 02:43:06.600
<v Speaker 2>with the bath water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We want to preserve the baby,</v>

3843
02:43:06.720 --> 02:43:08.050
<v Speaker 2>the governments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bath water.</v>

3844
02:43:08.070 --> 02:43:12.340
<v Speaker 2>So what you can do with your soap box is</v>
<v Speaker 2>get people to understand</v>

3845
02:43:12.490 --> 02:43:14.920
<v Speaker 3>the real source.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now what you can do now,</v>

3846
02:43:14.921 --> 02:43:19.600
<v Speaker 3>what your audience can do now to protect</v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves so they don't go broke.</v>

3847
02:43:19.750 --> 02:43:22.570
<v Speaker 3>And I think that to the extent that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't go broke,</v>

3848
02:43:23.050 --> 02:43:26.500
<v Speaker 3>you're in a better position to help the </v>
<v Speaker 3>economy and help the country if you have</v>

3849
02:43:26.501 --> 02:43:27.520
<v Speaker 3>resources,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3850
02:43:27.521 --> 02:43:28.270
<v Speaker 3>If you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

3851
02:43:28.271 --> 02:43:30.730
<v Speaker 3>if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if a ship is going to sink and I can get</v>

3852
02:43:30.731 --> 02:43:33.730
<v Speaker 3>you off the ship onto a lifeboat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then when the ship goes down,</v>

3853
02:43:33.731 --> 02:43:35.590
<v Speaker 3>you might be able to help some of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>people you know,</v>

3854
02:43:35.650 --> 02:43:38.050
<v Speaker 3>out of the water if you're not drowning </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself.</v>

3855
02:43:38.051 --> 02:43:43.051
<v Speaker 3>So what you could do is protect your </v>
<v Speaker 3>finances if you've got a large </v>

3856
02:43:43.051 --> 02:43:43.210
<v Speaker 3>portfolio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3857
02:43:43.211 --> 02:43:45.940
<v Speaker 3>What I do with my own money and what I </v>
<v Speaker 3>advise people,</v>

3858
02:43:45.941 --> 02:43:47.770
<v Speaker 3>I manage money at Europe Pacific,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3859
02:43:47.771 --> 02:43:52.771
<v Speaker 3>asset management at my broker dealer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>years of capital is I invest in </v>

3860
02:43:52.771 --> 02:43:52.930
<v Speaker 3>countries that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3861
02:43:53.090 --> 02:43:55.540
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think are relatively better shape,</v>

3862
02:43:55.570 --> 02:43:58.780
<v Speaker 3>whether it's Switzerland or Singapore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3863
02:43:58.840 --> 02:44:00.220
<v Speaker 3>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>New Zealand.</v>

3864
02:44:00.220 --> 02:44:02.360
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though New Zealand just left a,</v>

3865
02:44:02.420 --> 02:44:03.920
<v Speaker 3>a leftist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3866
02:44:04.110 --> 02:44:09.110
<v Speaker 3>they are calm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He is strong enough that I think they </v>

3867
02:44:09.110 --> 02:44:09.110
<v Speaker 3>can withstand it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've made enough progress,</v>

3868
02:44:09.110 --> 02:44:13.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there are countries out there that </v>

3869
02:44:13.830 --> 02:44:13.830
<v Speaker 3>are not nearly as screwed up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody is perfect.</v>

3870
02:44:13.830 --> 02:44:18.430
<v Speaker 3>Nobody is as good as America used to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there are a lot of countries that </v>

3871
02:44:18.430 --> 02:44:21.811
<v Speaker 3>are much better than we are now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they have assets that you can own </v>

3872
02:44:21.811 --> 02:44:22.600
<v Speaker 3>that are not in bubbles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can get good dividends,</v>

3873
02:44:22.780 --> 02:44:25.870
<v Speaker 3>you can protect yourself from this </v>
<v Speaker 3>coming stock market crash,</v>

3874
02:44:25.871 --> 02:44:26.920
<v Speaker 3>dollar crash,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bond,</v>

3875
02:44:26.921 --> 02:44:28.870
<v Speaker 3>market crash,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you can preserve your wealth.</v>

3876
02:44:28.871 --> 02:44:33.871
<v Speaker 3>And as the dollar goes down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you went through the 19 seventies </v>

3877
02:44:33.871 --> 02:44:37.231
<v Speaker 3>and you had your portfolio,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the 19 seventies the stock </v>

3878
02:44:37.231 --> 02:44:37.780
<v Speaker 3>market went way down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the dollar went down even more,</v>

3879
02:44:37.781 --> 02:44:39.550
<v Speaker 3>the dollar lost two thirds of its value.</v>

3880
02:44:39.730 --> 02:44:42.610
<v Speaker 3>The reason oil prices went up 10 fold in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the seventies,</v>

3881
02:44:42.730 --> 02:44:47.730
<v Speaker 3>the reason gold went from $35 an ounce </v>
<v Speaker 3>to 850 was because the dollar collapsed.</v>

3882
02:44:48.340 --> 02:44:53.340
<v Speaker 3>While the dollar is going to have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bigger collapse this time than it did </v>

3883
02:44:53.340 --> 02:44:53.340
<v Speaker 3>last time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right this time,</v>

3884
02:44:53.340 --> 02:44:55.810
<v Speaker 3>I think the dollar is going to lose its </v>
<v Speaker 3>status as the reserve currency.</v>

3885
02:44:56.140 --> 02:45:01.140
<v Speaker 3>Last time it didn't lose the status,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just got marked down because we went </v>

3886
02:45:01.140 --> 02:45:01.990
<v Speaker 3>off the gold standard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it didn't get knocked out.</v>

3887
02:45:01.991 --> 02:45:03.880
<v Speaker 3>I think the next one is gonna be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>knockout.</v>

3888
02:45:03.881 --> 02:45:06.220
<v Speaker 3>So you got to invest your money outside </v>
<v Speaker 3>theu ,</v>

3889
02:45:06.350 --> 02:45:11.350
<v Speaker 3>s to preserve your wealth when everybody</v>
<v Speaker 3>else is going broke and you got to own </v>

3890
02:45:11.350 --> 02:45:12.250
<v Speaker 3>real money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to own gold,</v>

3891
02:45:12.400 --> 02:45:14.140
<v Speaker 3>you own physical gold,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3892
02:45:14.141 --> 02:45:18.010
<v Speaker 3>Which you can buy larger quantities of </v>
<v Speaker 3>gold through shift goals.</v>

3893
02:45:18.190 --> 02:45:18.790
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got,</v>

3894
02:45:18.960 --> 02:45:20.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very low prices.</v>

3895
02:45:20.140 --> 02:45:22.810
<v Speaker 3>You've got to be careful out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are a lot of companies that'll try</v>

3896
02:45:22.811 --> 02:45:25.300
<v Speaker 3>to bait and switch you into collectible </v>
<v Speaker 3>coins.</v>

3897
02:45:25.301 --> 02:45:27.490
<v Speaker 3>Rare coins with these huge markups.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Twenty,</v>

3898
02:45:27.491 --> 02:45:28.990
<v Speaker 3>30,</v>
<v Speaker 3>40 percent markups,</v>

3899
02:45:29.080 --> 02:45:31.780
<v Speaker 3>sometimes 100 percent markups.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stay away from that.</v>

3900
02:45:32.020 --> 02:45:37.020
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just want to buy bullion and you </v>

3901
02:45:37.020 --> 02:45:37.020
<v Speaker 3>want to buy it as cheap as you can over </v>
<v Speaker 3>spot.</v>

3902
02:45:37.020 --> 02:45:41.250
<v Speaker 3>The only time you'd want to pay a little</v>
<v Speaker 3>bit more is to get some jewelry because </v>

3903
02:45:41.250 --> 02:45:44.641
<v Speaker 3>you want to wear it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then it's probably worth it to pay a </v>

3904
02:45:44.641 --> 02:45:44.641
<v Speaker 3>little extra if you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3905
02:45:44.641 --> 02:45:47.830
<v Speaker 3>buy something that you can wear it many.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But so you can do that.</v>

3906
02:45:48.190 --> 02:45:50.230
<v Speaker 3>I think the stocks that are going to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>up the most,</v>

3907
02:45:50.260 --> 02:45:53.950
<v Speaker 3>if you really want to potentially make a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of money on this crisis,</v>

3908
02:45:53.951 --> 02:45:58.120
<v Speaker 3>it will be gold stocks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gold bullion is not about getting rich.</v>

3909
02:45:58.390 --> 02:46:00.970
<v Speaker 3>It's about staying rich.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's about not getting poor.</v>

3910
02:46:01.120 --> 02:46:04.240
<v Speaker 3>Buying physical gold is about preserving</v>
<v Speaker 3>the wealth that you have,</v>

3911
02:46:04.600 --> 02:46:07.060
<v Speaker 3>but I think that these gold mining </v>
<v Speaker 3>companies,</v>

3912
02:46:07.061 --> 02:46:10.040
<v Speaker 3>when the price of gold goes up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think some of stocks go up 10,</v>

3913
02:46:10.040 --> 02:46:11.750
<v Speaker 2>20 times or more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you're,</v>

3914
02:46:11.751 --> 02:46:14.210
<v Speaker 2>if you know you can tolerate the risk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because if I'm wrong,</v>

3915
02:46:14.211 --> 02:46:16.730
<v Speaker 2>you know these stocks would go way down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if I'm right,</v>

3916
02:46:16.940 --> 02:46:20.390
<v Speaker 2>they're going to go way up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a way that you can really profit from</v>

3917
02:46:20.420 --> 02:46:25.420
<v Speaker 2>what's gonna happen is by having some </v>
<v Speaker 2>money investing in these coal mining </v>

3918
02:46:25.420 --> 02:46:28.331
<v Speaker 2>companies and then when we have a dollar</v>
<v Speaker 2>crisis and the price of gold goes way </v>

3919
02:46:28.331 --> 02:46:28.520
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these stocks can go ballistic.</v>

3920
02:46:29.480 --> 02:46:31.280
<v Speaker 2>The Voice of doom and the voice of </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason.</v>

3921
02:46:31.281 --> 02:46:33.200
<v Speaker 2>All in one man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Peter Schiff.</v>

3922
02:46:33.201 --> 02:46:35.180
