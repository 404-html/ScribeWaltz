00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.740
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's one of the rarest people I've ever</v>

13
00:00:24.741 --> 00:00:27.360
<v Speaker 2>met in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know anyone like that now.</v>

14
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.640
<v Speaker 2>There's a few guys that I know that is</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a stone cold,</v>

15
00:00:31.641 --> 00:00:34.760
<v Speaker 2>original.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Duncan's one of those.</v>

16
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:35.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's hilarious.</v>

17
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:36.620
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did He,</v>

18
00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.210
<v Speaker 2>did he give you the full virtual reality</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience?</v>

19
00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.150
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That stuff's amazing.</v>

20
00:00:41.151 --> 00:00:44.150
<v Speaker 2>I can't let any.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He told me that the porn is really crazy</v>

21
00:00:44.151 --> 00:00:45.950
<v Speaker 2>in it too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he didn't show me any of the point.</v>

22
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.280
<v Speaker 2>Gave me close to the porn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He gave me the headset like judy got.</v>

23
00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:50.301
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

24
00:00:50.301 --> 00:00:52.220
<v Speaker 2>I got right up to the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

25
00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going into the matrix.</v>

26
00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:56.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hit.</v>

27
00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.670
<v Speaker 2>I hit like a wall in his room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like shooting or dodging a thing or</v>

28
00:01:01.671 --> 00:01:04.670
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is exceptionally realistic.</v>

29
00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.230
<v Speaker 2>It's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you do the archery game where they.</v>

30
00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.070
<v Speaker 2>The little guys?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

31
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's another art tree one that I</v>

32
00:01:13.921 --> 00:01:15.090
<v Speaker 2>played to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was A.</v>

33
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's awesome.</v>

34
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.560
<v Speaker 2>There's one that you had to an archery</v>
<v Speaker 2>game where you had to dodge like and</v>

35
00:01:20.561 --> 00:01:23.530
<v Speaker 2>you're like moving like the Matrix to</v>
<v Speaker 2>dodge away from there.</v>

36
00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.030
<v Speaker 2>It was like a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like a good workout.</v>

37
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.720
<v Speaker 2>Can see the arrows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

38
00:01:27.721 --> 00:01:28.300
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

39
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.881
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

40
00:01:28.881 --> 00:01:32.060
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine it is a good workout</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I did his boxing one and that's</v>

41
00:01:32.061 --> 00:01:34.490
<v Speaker 2>a good workout.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You look boxing against this guy,</v>

42
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.340
<v Speaker 2>this video guy and I showed it to some</v>
<v Speaker 2>fighters and I was like,</v>

43
00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.690
<v Speaker 2>I really think that this could be an</v>
<v Speaker 2>amazing training tool if they could</v>

44
00:01:41.691 --> 00:01:46.691
<v Speaker 2>figure out how to make the headset so</v>
<v Speaker 2>that maybe for the cord was in the back.</v>

45
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.700
<v Speaker 2>If it didn't interfere as long as you</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't do anything where you had to spin</v>

46
00:01:49.701 --> 00:01:51.800
<v Speaker 2>around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would probably be effective,</v>

47
00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.610
<v Speaker 2>but it can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can map your body movements like</v>

48
00:01:55.611 --> 00:01:56.990
<v Speaker 2>they had that Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd notice that,</v>

49
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.480
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't there an xbox one,</v>

50
00:01:59.481 --> 00:02:03.110
<v Speaker 2>we're just sort of takes a picture of</v>
<v Speaker 2>your body as you're standing there,</v>

51
00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.980
<v Speaker 1>connect had this fixed before the show</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you got to connect.</v>

52
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:11.040
<v Speaker 1>Can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can read your like heat body heat.</v>

53
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.450
<v Speaker 1>It can pick up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort.</v>

54
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.770
<v Speaker 1>Not like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not reading your skeleton,</v>

55
00:02:13.771 --> 00:02:17.460
<v Speaker 1>but it can pick up your limbs and stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it picks up the length of your lens</v>

56
00:02:17.461 --> 00:02:18.540
<v Speaker 1>as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they're moving.</v>

57
00:02:18.541 --> 00:02:19.450
<v Speaker 1>Like if you do the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

58
00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.960
<v Speaker 1>insanity or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that will work out.</v>

59
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.840
<v Speaker 1>It can tell how high you're lifting your</v>
<v Speaker 1>knees up and if you're not bringing them</v>

60
00:02:24.841 --> 00:02:27.030
<v Speaker 1>up to the right level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll tell you like bring them up</v>

61
00:02:27.031 --> 00:02:28.220
<v Speaker 1>higher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lift your legs higher level.</v>

62
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.380
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>High enough.</v>

63
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.950
<v Speaker 2>Like give you points based on how you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing and whatnot.</v>

64
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.550
<v Speaker 2>Obviously this is rudimentary in</v>
<v Speaker 2>comparison to what it's going to be in a</v>

65
00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:38.330
<v Speaker 2>few years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah.</v>

66
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.700
<v Speaker 2>And with police training and stuff like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

67
00:02:40.701 --> 00:02:43.400
<v Speaker 2>especially once,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know exactly how they do it,</v>

68
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.240
<v Speaker 2>but once it's like kind of wireless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you don't have the cord attached to</v>

69
00:02:47.241 --> 00:02:52.160
<v Speaker 2>you and then maybe you could have like</v>
<v Speaker 2>larger facilities than just a small room</v>

70
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.130
<v Speaker 2>eventually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

71
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.023
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

72
00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.510
<v Speaker 2>doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't you say that we're already doing</v>

73
00:02:56.511 --> 00:02:57.770
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're doing warehouses,</v>

74
00:02:57.771 --> 00:03:00.040
<v Speaker 2>they're setting up warehouses for VR VR</v>

75
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.450
<v Speaker 3>sets and they're going to have feedback</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the warehouses like,</v>

76
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.830
<v Speaker 3>like fans that blow a wind on you and is</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be like movement and some parts</v>

77
00:03:08.831 --> 00:03:11.310
<v Speaker 3>of the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some shit.</v>

78
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:12.331
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

79
00:03:12.331 --> 00:03:13.480
<v Speaker 3>I played,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

80
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.190
<v Speaker 3>I played one of the ones was a paintball</v>
<v Speaker 3>one with other people that were online</v>

81
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.610
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I guess we've had kind of,</v>

82
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.440
<v Speaker 3>people have been playing other people</v>
<v Speaker 3>online,</v>

83
00:03:23.441 --> 00:03:25.300
<v Speaker 3>but when you're doing it in virtual</v>
<v Speaker 3>reality,</v>

84
00:03:25.301 --> 00:03:27.940
<v Speaker 3>it's just a totally different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

85
00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:31.480
<v Speaker 3>I can only imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw there was one that they had these</v>

86
00:03:31.481 --> 00:03:34.690
<v Speaker 3>people on an omnidirectional treadmill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen those?</v>

87
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:36.160
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You sit,</v>

88
00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.570
<v Speaker 3>I can get the idea that you're in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>circular containment and you have like a</v>

89
00:03:40.571 --> 00:03:44.170
<v Speaker 3>harness on your waist so you don't ever</v>
<v Speaker 3>walk forward and touch the bars.</v>

90
00:03:44.171 --> 00:03:46.000
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're kind of strapped in place.</v>

91
00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.180
<v Speaker 3>And then your feet dictate which way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This surface that you're on spins,</v>

92
00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.530
<v Speaker 3>it's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a treadmill,</v>

93
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.440
<v Speaker 3>but it's not a treadmill like it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>always going.</v>

94
00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.120
<v Speaker 3>So you have to keep up with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a treadmill that you propel,</v>

95
00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.430
<v Speaker 3>which I've seen before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people actually liked those.</v>

96
00:04:00.431 --> 00:04:04.530
<v Speaker 3>They put them on like a serious incline</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they do crazy sprints on these.</v>

97
00:04:04.531 --> 00:04:07.750
<v Speaker 3>A self propelling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>self moving treadmills.</v>

98
00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.620
<v Speaker 3>So this guy had this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh here.</v>

99
00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.570
<v Speaker 3>Is that it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

100
00:04:10.571 --> 00:04:12.700
<v Speaker 3>there it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's the omnidirectional treadmill.</v>

101
00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.890
<v Speaker 3>So they got to see how he's hooked up to</v>
<v Speaker 3>this harness.</v>

102
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.180
<v Speaker 3>So he's in the center of it and it seems</v>
<v Speaker 3>to spin on bearings or something.</v>

103
00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.860
<v Speaker 3>And so he's moving like literally moving</v>
<v Speaker 3>through this,</v>

104
00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.490
<v Speaker 3>this virtual world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could have just enormous landscapes</v>

105
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.070
<v Speaker 3>that play out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>

106
00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

107
00:04:36.071 --> 00:04:37.600
<v Speaker 3>people are going to get lost in there.</v>

108
00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.840
<v Speaker 3>You're also going to get really fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>tired because I'll tell you what,</v>

109
00:04:40.841 --> 00:04:45.841
<v Speaker 3>like playing that archery game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my arms were so tired just from holding</v>

110
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.660
<v Speaker 3>like it's like a static thing with your</v>
<v Speaker 3>left arm and particularly you're holding</v>

111
00:04:49.661 --> 00:04:52.960
<v Speaker 3>your arm in one position and then your</v>
<v Speaker 3>right arm that you're drawn the</v>

112
00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.630
<v Speaker 3>bowstring back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're holding that in one position,</v>

113
00:04:55.631 --> 00:04:58.090
<v Speaker 3>like constantly game is like 20 minutes</v>
<v Speaker 3>long.</v>

114
00:04:58.091 --> 00:05:01.180
<v Speaker 3>Did he do the paint brush stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did not.</v>

115
00:05:01.181 --> 00:05:03.010
<v Speaker 3>I only did two things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did the boxing one.</v>

116
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:04.810
<v Speaker 3>Well I did three.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did the boxing one.</v>

117
00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.070
<v Speaker 3>I did the archery one than I did the one</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you just stand there and the whale</v>

118
00:05:09.071 --> 00:05:14.071
<v Speaker 3>comes up to you saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well the paint stuff I think is going to</v>

119
00:05:14.231 --> 00:05:17.470
<v Speaker 3>be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that is one that's kind of like</v>

120
00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.710
<v Speaker 3>almost there already as far as how good</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>

121
00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:22.390
<v Speaker 3>You know that the archery one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

122
00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:25.660
<v Speaker 3>oh these little like two dimensional</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of things that are,</v>

123
00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:26.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not,</v>

124
00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.500
<v Speaker 3>it's not like amazing graphics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that was amazing though,</v>

125
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.810
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it will be a lot better in the</v>

126
00:05:31.811 --> 00:05:33.210
<v Speaker 3>future,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the paint one is,</v>

127
00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:38.250
<v Speaker 3>is just this virtual paint.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you paint like you use a spray can</v>

128
00:05:38.441 --> 00:05:41.340
<v Speaker 3>hear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you put sparks in this area and</v>

129
00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:44.740
<v Speaker 3>then you can like walk through it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can make a circle around yourself</v>

130
00:05:44.741 --> 00:05:48.250
<v Speaker 3>and then walk through it and shrink it</v>
<v Speaker 3>and enlarge it and you can see all these</v>

131
00:05:48.251 --> 00:05:52.600
<v Speaker 3>people that have like painted entire</v>
<v Speaker 3>ships like spaceships that you can then</v>

132
00:05:52.601 --> 00:05:57.601
<v Speaker 3>go inside and walk around and see all</v>
<v Speaker 3>the different areas they've made and</v>

133
00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:01.010
<v Speaker 2>you can add your own graffiti to it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that.</v>

134
00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.570
<v Speaker 2>I think that's going to be like to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone like Alex grey or something like</v>

135
00:06:05.571 --> 00:06:06.470
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get in there,</v>

136
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:07.820
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

137
00:06:07.821 --> 00:06:09.970
<v Speaker 2>I saw a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw a demonstration of that.</v>

138
00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:11.760
<v Speaker 2>Or they're doing it in three dimensional</v>
<v Speaker 2>deal.</v>

139
00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:13.580
<v Speaker 2>It's going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy made something like you're</v>

140
00:06:13.581 --> 00:06:18.581
<v Speaker 2>describing as for little different rooms</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he has within the little.</v>

141
00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:22.580
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the virtual world is a big room.</v>

142
00:06:22.581 --> 00:06:24.560
<v Speaker 2>You have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you made for little ones than the.</v>

143
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:28.130
<v Speaker 2>And these are all little paint things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you could make using the program.</v>

144
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:32.360
<v Speaker 2>And what a program is he on this call?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's on vive.</v>

145
00:06:32.361 --> 00:06:34.250
<v Speaker 2>It's called tilt brush.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does the actual program.</v>

146
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.770
<v Speaker 2>Did you know the guy who invented</v>
<v Speaker 2>oculus?</v>

147
00:06:36.771 --> 00:06:39.520
<v Speaker 2>There's only like 24.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

148
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.650
<v Speaker 2>Did you hear about the stuff going on</v>
<v Speaker 2>with them this weekend?</v>

149
00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:45.770
<v Speaker 2>He's a trump supporter and his</v>
<v Speaker 2>girlfriend's a Gamer.</v>

150
00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:49.790
<v Speaker 2>Gator paid like billion dollar million</v>
<v Speaker 2>dollar girlfriend.</v>

151
00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:50.893
<v Speaker 2>Hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What'd he say?</v>

152
00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:54.620
<v Speaker 2>He paid for a fund that funded those</v>
<v Speaker 2>memes.</v>

153
00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:58.220
<v Speaker 2>Like the trump memes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a meme.</v>

154
00:06:58.221 --> 00:06:59.054
<v Speaker 2>Funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

155
00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:00.860
<v Speaker 2>I'll look it up while we're talking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about.</v>

156
00:07:00.861 --> 00:07:03.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's hilarious.</v>

157
00:07:03.441 --> 00:07:05.660
<v Speaker 2>There's a strange world that we're in</v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

158
00:07:05.661 --> 00:07:07.430
<v Speaker 2>Thinks his name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like Palmer Luckey.</v>

159
00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:08.660
<v Speaker 2>Does that sound right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

160
00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:10.760
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How weird.</v>

161
00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:15.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm a meme fund that seems so counter</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it was more effective than the</v>

162
00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:23.820
<v Speaker 2>commercials they put on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably everyone on facebook and</v>

163
00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:29.090
<v Speaker 2>especially because facebook's kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a lot of older people are on there</v>

164
00:07:29.091 --> 00:07:34.091
<v Speaker 2>now and they're real suckers for those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I like America share this.</v>

165
00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:41.560
<v Speaker 2>If you're brave enough</v>
<v Speaker 2>to share it.</v>

166
00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:47.990
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of that going around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like those old letters that like</v>

167
00:07:47.991 --> 00:07:50.210
<v Speaker 2>when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the chain letters had come and if you</v>

168
00:07:50.211 --> 00:07:53.780
<v Speaker 2>didn't send it to like seven people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd have bad luck or you know,</v>

169
00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:54.580
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is.</v>

170
00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:57.770
<v Speaker 2>And now people are falling for that with</v>
<v Speaker 2>like trump memes.</v>

171
00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:01.220
<v Speaker 2>Are you aware of shit posting?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

172
00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:02.270
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie.</v>

173
00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:07.420
<v Speaker 2>Jamie alerted me to this new thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie's already interests catchy name.</v>

174
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:10.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I need Jamie to keep me in touch with</v>

175
00:08:10.641 --> 00:08:12.220
<v Speaker 2>the young folk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

176
00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:16.260
<v Speaker 2>but there's a thing called shit posting</v>
<v Speaker 2>and which shit posting is a,</v>

177
00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:18.980
<v Speaker 2>correct me if I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's part of the alt right.</v>

178
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:22.730
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that how it's not necessarily they do</v>

179
00:08:22.731 --> 00:08:23.850
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think it has to end.</v>

180
00:08:23.851 --> 00:08:24.830
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

181
00:08:24.831 --> 00:08:26.840
<v Speaker 2>doesn't have an affiliation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>

182
00:08:26.841 --> 00:08:31.841
<v Speaker 2>but the idea is you just posting a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 2>of ridiculous shit like just to do it</v>

183
00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.870
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you maybe your intelligence level,</v>

184
00:08:35.871 --> 00:08:40.280
<v Speaker 2>maybe several steps above the stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're posting and you're kind of half</v>

185
00:08:40.281 --> 00:08:44.470
<v Speaker 2>trolling and being shitty at the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>time before the idea to form a trolling,</v>

186
00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:45.830
<v Speaker 2>trolling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking the new.</v>

187
00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:47.720
<v Speaker 2>It's a new turn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The but by the same,</v>

188
00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:50.810
<v Speaker 2>by the same shit posting like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's shit.</v>

189
00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:53.540
<v Speaker 2>Is that the idea behind it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The value of what you're posting is</v>

190
00:08:53.541 --> 00:08:54.374
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

191
00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:55.630
<v Speaker 2>The description,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

192
00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:56.250
<v Speaker 2>That</v>

193
00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:57.930
<v Speaker 3>you're aware of it when you're doing it</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

194
00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:02.170
<v Speaker 3>That's why it's like trolling yet and so</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea is just to rile people up who</v>

195
00:09:02.171 --> 00:09:03.810
<v Speaker 3>were like Hillary supporters or</v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

196
00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:09.480
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the most bizarre political event</v>

197
00:09:09.481 --> 00:09:12.210
<v Speaker 3>I can ever remember in my life is too</v>
<v Speaker 3>much.</v>

198
00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.570
<v Speaker 4>I don't handle it well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I try to not watch the news and stuff</v>

199
00:09:16.571 --> 00:09:18.220
<v Speaker 4>and it's still just so pervasive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have</v>

200
00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:19.300
<v Speaker 3>to watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

201
00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:21.420
<v Speaker 3>It's like a sports that you have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>follow.</v>

202
00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.880
<v Speaker 3>It's like a sporting event you have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>follow.</v>

203
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.080
<v Speaker 3>There was a video that a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 3>celebrities put out that is so god damn</v>

204
00:09:28.081 --> 00:09:33.081
<v Speaker 3>confusing because it's celebrities</v>
<v Speaker 3>telling you to go out and vote and</v>

205
00:09:33.511 --> 00:09:37.980
<v Speaker 3>they're showing all this stuff that</v>
<v Speaker 3>makes both of them look fucking</v>

206
00:09:37.981 --> 00:09:39.960
<v Speaker 3>terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's such a confusing video because</v>

207
00:09:39.961 --> 00:09:44.961
<v Speaker 3>there's all this stuff about Bengazi,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all this stuff about like the Hillary</v>

208
00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:47.460
<v Speaker 3>Clinton scandals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the various scandals is playing on in</v>

209
00:09:47.461 --> 00:09:52.461
<v Speaker 3>the background while I'm ironman fuck's</v>
<v Speaker 3>named Robert Downey jr talks and then a</v>

210
00:09:54.541 --> 00:09:58.530
<v Speaker 3>bunch of other celebrities talk and some</v>
<v Speaker 3>of them are like really ridiculous,</v>

211
00:09:58.531 --> 00:10:01.590
<v Speaker 3>like some of them were starting to cry</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they're talking.</v>

212
00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:03.450
<v Speaker 3>This is so important.</v>

213
00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:08.570
<v Speaker 5>Being a part of that decision,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I might think it's not important.</v>

214
00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:12.450
<v Speaker 5>I think you are not important,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's not true and the only one,</v>

215
00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.570
<v Speaker 3>but there's another version of this that</v>
<v Speaker 3>has.</v>

216
00:10:14.571 --> 00:10:16.790
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe maybe this is different.</v>

217
00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:20.900
<v Speaker 3>I think I've been hoodwinked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think this is probably the real one</v>

218
00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:25.220
<v Speaker 3>because it says save the day and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>channel saved the day and the other one</v>

219
00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:28.730
<v Speaker 3>is someone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone made it and took their speeches</v>

220
00:10:28.731 --> 00:10:32.060
<v Speaker 3>with some of their imagery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then put a bunch of stuff in the</v>

221
00:10:32.061 --> 00:10:36.710
<v Speaker 3>background showing like how fucked up</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Benghazi situation is.</v>

222
00:10:36.711 --> 00:10:40.820
<v Speaker 3>How fucked up Donald Trump's past is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many people are suing trump</v>

223
00:10:40.821 --> 00:10:45.821
<v Speaker 3>university and then it all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it makes this thing about saving the</v>

224
00:10:45.951 --> 00:10:49.870
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess most of what saved the day is is</v>

225
00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:53.930
<v Speaker 3>like anti-trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you see the video that whoever</v>

226
00:10:53.931 --> 00:10:57.440
<v Speaker 3>has created this put together online,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it shows a lot of fucked up hillary</v>

227
00:10:57.441 --> 00:11:00.110
<v Speaker 3>stuff too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really lets you know like,</v>

228
00:11:00.111 --> 00:11:01.580
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you ain't saving shit stupid.</v>

229
00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:07.590
<v Speaker 4>We're the other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's changing this culture and memes and</v>

230
00:11:07.821 --> 00:11:08.530
<v Speaker 4>everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

231
00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:13.070
<v Speaker 4>it's completely changing what the role</v>
<v Speaker 4>of politicians is,</v>

232
00:11:13.071 --> 00:11:16.160
<v Speaker 4>what the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the president actually does.</v>

233
00:11:16.161 --> 00:11:19.940
<v Speaker 4>Whereas it used to be like you'd need a</v>
<v Speaker 4>representative to ride on horseback or</v>

234
00:11:19.941 --> 00:11:23.150
<v Speaker 4>whatever and and now it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't really need any of that</v>

235
00:11:23.151 --> 00:11:24.500
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so now it's just,</v>

236
00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:28.370
<v Speaker 4>these are just people that are going</v>
<v Speaker 4>around giving pep talks because by</v>

237
00:11:28.371 --> 00:11:31.880
<v Speaker 4>necessity they have to raise a certain</v>
<v Speaker 4>amount of money so they have to go to</v>

238
00:11:31.881 --> 00:11:34.670
<v Speaker 4>each town and say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>America,</v>

239
00:11:34.671 --> 00:11:37.940
<v Speaker 4>I liked America the most.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The other guy doesn't like America the</v>

240
00:11:37.941 --> 00:11:41.330
<v Speaker 4>best and I support the troops the most.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The other person doesn't and they're</v>

241
00:11:41.331 --> 00:11:44.270
<v Speaker 4>just giving the same talk and every.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not actually.</v>

242
00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:47.600
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how much,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how they could have any time to actually</v>

243
00:11:47.601 --> 00:11:49.790
<v Speaker 4>be doing the job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

244
00:11:49.791 --> 00:11:53.230
<v Speaker 4>they're just going around marketing and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of by necessity and how about</v>

245
00:11:53.231 --> 00:11:54.064
<v Speaker 4>when they have,</v>

246
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:57.190
<v Speaker 2>when they're marketing and they have</v>
<v Speaker 2>another job already,</v>

247
00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:59.920
<v Speaker 2>like they're already a senator or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that and they don't,</v>

248
00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:02.860
<v Speaker 2>they don't give up the job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just start campaigning.</v>

249
00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.950
<v Speaker 2>Like when the camp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the president was campaigning for</v>

250
00:12:05.951 --> 00:12:10.060
<v Speaker 2>reelection,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a good percentage of him working</v>

251
00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:13.270
<v Speaker 2>with him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing his job was him campaigning to do</v>

252
00:12:13.271 --> 00:12:18.160
<v Speaker 2>it again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what the fuck that's.</v>

253
00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:20.050
<v Speaker 2>And it's getting earlier and earlier</v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

254
00:12:20.051 --> 00:12:21.880
<v Speaker 2>So we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll be done what we've been hearing</v>

255
00:12:21.881 --> 00:12:26.560
<v Speaker 2>about this for like two years now and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then after the election we'll maybe get</v>

256
00:12:26.561 --> 00:12:30.430
<v Speaker 2>like maybe a year break before they'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>start in on what the,</v>

257
00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:34.720
<v Speaker 2>what the next election cycle is going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be and everyone thinking this is very</v>

258
00:12:34.721 --> 00:12:38.410
<v Speaker 2>important and very exciting and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>time to change things.</v>

259
00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:41.380
<v Speaker 2>Very important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a solution,</v>

260
00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:46.500
<v Speaker 2>but I do have a question like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't it be better for everybody if</v>

261
00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:52.440
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't advertise better for</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody if you also couldn't pay</v>

262
00:12:53.201 --> 00:12:57.760
<v Speaker 2>people to put promos up or posters up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that was completely off the table.</v>

263
00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:59.320
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

264
00:12:59.321 --> 00:13:00.154
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the deal.</v>

265
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:03.220
<v Speaker 2>People can support your campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

266
00:13:03.221 --> 00:13:05.230
<v Speaker 2>they can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can get behind you,</v>

267
00:13:05.231 --> 00:13:07.750
<v Speaker 2>they can endorse you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no ads.</v>

268
00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:08.471
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

269
00:13:08.471 --> 00:13:12.250
<v Speaker 2>Like we need a cultural spam filter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

270
00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:17.400
<v Speaker 2>Because now even if these people</v>
<v Speaker 2>genuinely say it's just this person who</v>

271
00:13:17.741 --> 00:13:21.790
<v Speaker 2>genuinely wants to make a difference as</v>
<v Speaker 2>super smart that they know just how to</v>

272
00:13:21.791 --> 00:13:23.980
<v Speaker 2>do the job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they won't be able to write.</v>

273
00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:25.840
<v Speaker 2>They have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to go out.</v>

274
00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:27.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obama's very bright dude.</v>

275
00:13:27.731 --> 00:13:30.460
<v Speaker 2>Seems like a hard working guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's still,</v>

276
00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just out there giving pep talks and</v>

277
00:13:32.561 --> 00:13:33.960
<v Speaker 2>having to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

278
00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:38.080
<v Speaker 2>raise funds and I think it's ridiculous</v>
<v Speaker 2>to try to pretend that one person is</v>

279
00:13:38.081 --> 00:13:40.450
<v Speaker 2>even capable of running the United</v>
<v Speaker 2>States government.</v>

280
00:13:40.451 --> 00:13:44.800
<v Speaker 2>Something so monstrously huge</v>
<v Speaker 2>encompassing the irs,</v>

281
00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:46.240
<v Speaker 2>the CIA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the NSA,</v>

282
00:13:46.241 --> 00:13:51.241
<v Speaker 2>the FBI fucking garage down the line</v>
<v Speaker 2>with every union and all the different</v>

283
00:13:51.371 --> 00:13:54.360
<v Speaker 2>special interest groups that he has to</v>
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>

284
00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:56.200
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they all contribute to his campaign.</v>

285
00:13:56.201 --> 00:13:58.570
<v Speaker 2>He has to help them out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's just so many different people as</v>

286
00:13:58.571 --> 00:14:01.000
<v Speaker 2>to me from other countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so many different foreign</v>

287
00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:03.970
<v Speaker 2>interests he has to address.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so many different deals that are</v>

288
00:14:03.971 --> 00:14:06.310
<v Speaker 2>on the table.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How the fuck could he.</v>

289
00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:11.460
<v Speaker 2>It's like having 100 jobs and why not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rather than going to each small town and</v>

290
00:14:11.981 --> 00:14:14.440
<v Speaker 2>giving the same speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we have the Internet,</v>

291
00:14:14.441 --> 00:14:18.370
<v Speaker 2>we have TV.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why not just get together and have like</v>

292
00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:23.200
<v Speaker 2>a podcast or like once a week where you</v>
<v Speaker 2>just talk about what you're doing and</v>

293
00:14:23.201 --> 00:14:26.270
<v Speaker 2>what your plans are and you're shooting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're getting together with certain W,</v>

294
00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:31.860
<v Speaker 2>whatever experts you're working with and</v>
<v Speaker 2>giving a summary on what's actually</v>

295
00:14:32.021 --> 00:14:37.021
<v Speaker 2>happening and how things work so people</v>
<v Speaker 2>are involved and understand and can give</v>

296
00:14:37.151 --> 00:14:42.151
<v Speaker 2>feedback on it rather than 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's because right now there's</v>

297
00:14:43.061 --> 00:14:44.490
<v Speaker 2>just no substance and even.</v>

298
00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:47.350
<v Speaker 2>I used to think that debate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the debates were like,</v>

299
00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:48.371
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

300
00:14:48.371 --> 00:14:52.250
<v Speaker 2>Finally there they're going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

301
00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:54.170
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're a of substance,</v>

302
00:14:54.171 --> 00:14:56.750
<v Speaker 2>but it's just you have one person on one</v>
<v Speaker 2>side,</v>

303
00:14:56.751 --> 00:15:01.130
<v Speaker 2>one on the other in and they're just</v>
<v Speaker 2>digging their trenches and they're not</v>

304
00:15:01.131 --> 00:15:04.310
<v Speaker 2>open to the other person's idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not having a conversation like,</v>

305
00:15:04.311 --> 00:15:09.311
<v Speaker 2>I wish I wish someone would just make</v>
<v Speaker 2>these two children just sit down and</v>

306
00:15:09.351 --> 00:15:14.250
<v Speaker 2>have a fucking conversation over over</v>
<v Speaker 2>tea or something like that.</v>

307
00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:15.620
<v Speaker 2>Because all they're trying to do is</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

308
00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:17.360
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's really what they're trying to do.</v>

309
00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:19.850
<v Speaker 2>Trying to employ the best strategy for</v>
<v Speaker 2>success.</v>

310
00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:22.060
<v Speaker 2>They're going to figure out a way to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that fucking White House.</v>

311
00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:24.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just so stressful.</v>

312
00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:28.610
<v Speaker 2>It's so strange and it goes along the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same lines to me is there's some certain</v>

313
00:15:28.611 --> 00:15:31.820
<v Speaker 2>things that have been around for a long</v>
<v Speaker 2>time that I'm like,</v>

314
00:15:31.821 --> 00:15:33.950
<v Speaker 2>how did they ever let this get in?</v>

315
00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:37.340
<v Speaker 2>Like if you are operating for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>greater good of the people,</v>

316
00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:40.640
<v Speaker 2>not for the most amount of money that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to receive for making these</v>

317
00:15:40.641 --> 00:15:43.280
<v Speaker 2>decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you're operating for the greater</v>

318
00:15:43.281 --> 00:15:46.430
<v Speaker 2>good of the people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would you let pharmaceutical drug</v>

319
00:15:46.431 --> 00:15:50.420
<v Speaker 2>companies make advertisements?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would you let politicians make</v>

320
00:15:50.421 --> 00:15:53.840
<v Speaker 2>advertisements?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would you let all the cigarette</v>

321
00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:56.540
<v Speaker 2>industry?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How the fuck is that still around?</v>

322
00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:57.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How?</v>

323
00:15:57.340 --> 00:16:00.320
<v Speaker 2>Hi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how are you still allowing that and then</v>

324
00:16:00.321 --> 00:16:02.060
<v Speaker 2>you're saying that marijuana should be</v>
<v Speaker 2>illegal.</v>

325
00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:05.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's so many of these ancient</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that are so ridiculous that had</v>

326
00:16:05.961 --> 00:16:07.160
<v Speaker 2>been around forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

327
00:16:07.161 --> 00:16:09.780
<v Speaker 2>and then things like the dea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which just a.</v>

328
00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:12.020
<v Speaker 2>What was that three weeks ago when they</v>
<v Speaker 2>decided what?</v>

329
00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:15.650
<v Speaker 2>They weren't going to reschedule it even</v>
<v Speaker 2>though everything's going that direction</v>

330
00:16:15.651 --> 00:16:19.730
<v Speaker 2>clearly and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing pointing the other</v>

331
00:16:19.731 --> 00:16:20.531
<v Speaker 2>direction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

332
00:16:20.531 --> 00:16:21.140
<v Speaker 2>There's no.</v>

333
00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:22.010
<v Speaker 2>There's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

334
00:16:22.011 --> 00:16:26.420
<v Speaker 2>we have some conflicting studies and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>looks like marijuana could possibly do</v>

335
00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:28.240
<v Speaker 2>some sort of memory damage or this or</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

336
00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:29.113
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's none of that.</v>

337
00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:30.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

338
00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:32.270
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of like.</v>

339
00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:36.320
<v Speaker 2>I remember the gay marriage debate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like 10 years ago it was just like,</v>

340
00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:38.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't care if you're the most</v>
<v Speaker 2>homophobic,</v>

341
00:16:38.781 --> 00:16:41.120
<v Speaker 2>you have your religious beliefs or</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>

342
00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:44.930
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the inability to see that this is</v>

343
00:16:44.931 --> 00:16:47.720
<v Speaker 2>happening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this is where it's going and you're</v>

344
00:16:47.721 --> 00:16:52.721
<v Speaker 2>just wasting a lot of time on a losing</v>
<v Speaker 2>battle is kind of troubling that people</v>

345
00:16:53.541 --> 00:16:57.530
<v Speaker 2>aren't able to look at society and be</v>
<v Speaker 2>able to make better predictions.</v>

346
00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.930
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they got caught up in a lot of it is</v>

347
00:16:59.931 --> 00:17:03.410
<v Speaker 2>religious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A giant percentage of it is the beliefs</v>

348
00:17:03.411 --> 00:17:07.190
<v Speaker 2>that people have about key people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are based on whatever religion they grew</v>

349
00:17:07.191 --> 00:17:08.024
<v Speaker 2>up with.</v>

350
00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:11.000
<v Speaker 2>It's the only reason why you would care</v>
<v Speaker 2>nipple.</v>

351
00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:12.770
<v Speaker 2>We're agnostic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guarantee you if you like,</v>

352
00:17:12.771 --> 00:17:17.771
<v Speaker 2>did some sort of a survey and checked</v>
<v Speaker 2>atheist versus pick whatever religious</v>

353
00:17:17.961 --> 00:17:21.770
<v Speaker 2>designation and saw which ones were</v>
<v Speaker 2>against gay marriage,</v>

354
00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:24.120
<v Speaker 2>it would be almost all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The religious ones.</v>

355
00:17:24.121 --> 00:17:27.650
<v Speaker 2>So there's no like there's no secular</v>
<v Speaker 2>argument against it.</v>

356
00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:29.360
<v Speaker 2>The only argument against that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

357
00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:32.090
<v Speaker 2>you fucking people got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Light Gay folk style.</v>

358
00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:33.770
<v Speaker 2>Don't get married,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't do it.</v>

359
00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:37.930
<v Speaker 2>Like you can't get pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can't rope you in illegally.</v>

360
00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:40.460
<v Speaker 2>Entangled to some other dude that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>might get tired of blowing.</v>

361
00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:41.373
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

362
00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:42.490
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

363
00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:46.280
<v Speaker 2>just don't buy into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of like A.</v>

364
00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:49.450
<v Speaker 2>I feel that way about some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

365
00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:53.010
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they celebrate like Jessica Jones</v>

366
00:17:53.011 --> 00:17:56.940
<v Speaker 2>or something like that where a sec.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Finally there's like a strong female</v>

367
00:17:56.941 --> 00:17:59.400
<v Speaker 2>leader and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was Jessica Jones.</v>

368
00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:03.570
<v Speaker 2>It's a TV show on Netflix,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like one of those comic book TV show.</v>

369
00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:07.730
<v Speaker 2>It's just the idea of how dare you think</v>
<v Speaker 2>we should know that fee.</v>

370
00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:13.410
<v Speaker 2>Been some new store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like up epo or whatever it was.</v>

371
00:18:13.790 --> 00:18:16.140
<v Speaker 2>John's capital.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Siri fucked up and he didn't know what</v>

372
00:18:16.141 --> 00:18:18.930
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the idea of have like a strong</v>

373
00:18:18.931 --> 00:18:23.130
<v Speaker 2>female lead being being a shitty like</v>
<v Speaker 2>action movie,</v>

374
00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:27.540
<v Speaker 2>but like women can make shitty mindless</v>
<v Speaker 2>shooter movies too.</v>

375
00:18:27.541 --> 00:18:28.890
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is it,</v>

376
00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:33.090
<v Speaker 2>why is that a positive thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rather rather than having like a female</v>

377
00:18:33.091 --> 00:18:35.160
<v Speaker 2>be president in a movie or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>

378
00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:39.060
<v Speaker 2>some substantial already had that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Angela Bassett was president in one</v>

379
00:18:39.061 --> 00:18:43.110
<v Speaker 2>movie one time and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the big one was of course a Gorney</v>

380
00:18:43.111 --> 00:18:47.190
<v Speaker 2>weaver in fucking alien.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's the best bad ass chick ever.</v>

381
00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:50.790
<v Speaker 2>Who's more bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She didn't have any fucking superpowers.</v>

382
00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:56.210
<v Speaker 2>Just a woman who survived on a spaceship</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a fucking creature that nobody had</v>

383
00:18:56.281 --> 00:18:59.280
<v Speaker 2>ever seen before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That movie was the shit.</v>

384
00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:02.460
<v Speaker 2>And nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody disliked that movie because a</v>

385
00:19:02.461 --> 00:19:03.960
<v Speaker 2>woman was the lead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

386
00:19:03.961 --> 00:19:06.540
<v Speaker 2>that's where all this ghostbusters shit</v>
<v Speaker 2>falls apart.</v>

387
00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:07.890
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are crying,</v>

388
00:19:07.891 --> 00:19:10.320
<v Speaker 2>sexism and all the sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

389
00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:13.320
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just wasn't good.</v>

390
00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:14.700
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of.</v>

391
00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:18.090
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was that movie that everyone loves</v>

392
00:19:18.091 --> 00:19:19.590
<v Speaker 2>the wedding movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The wedding planner.</v>

393
00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:21.600
<v Speaker 2>No bridesmaids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bridesmaids.</v>

394
00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:24.600
<v Speaker 2>Everybody loves that fucking movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like universally,</v>

395
00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:26.160
<v Speaker 2>I've never heard anybody who saw that</v>
<v Speaker 2>movie.</v>

396
00:19:26.161 --> 00:19:28.500
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think it was funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've only watched like an hour,</v>

397
00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:32.100
<v Speaker 2>but I was laughing my ass off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking funny and it's just funny.</v>

398
00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:34.770
<v Speaker 2>It's funny with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like when Sarah Silverman goes up,</v>

399
00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:38.310
<v Speaker 2>she's not funny for a chick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking funny.</v>

400
00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:39.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

401
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.890
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like that's when,</v>

402
00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:45.950
<v Speaker 2>when it's just that it's undeniable</v>
<v Speaker 2>alien is an undeniable movie and it</v>

403
00:19:46.471 --> 00:19:48.970
<v Speaker 2>doesn't matter if like you would if it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was brewed.</v>

404
00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:53.460
<v Speaker 2>It's perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's perfect as it is.</v>

405
00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:58.050
<v Speaker 2>So like the idea that we need a female</v>
<v Speaker 2>leader so badly that we're willing to</v>

406
00:19:58.051 --> 00:20:00.360
<v Speaker 2>take this one that's embroiled in</v>
<v Speaker 2>controversy.</v>

407
00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:02.070
<v Speaker 2>She's in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she faints,</v>

408
00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:03.690
<v Speaker 2>she's fainting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we bring it up,</v>

409
00:20:03.691 --> 00:20:06.360
<v Speaker 2>we're a sexist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not supposed to fall asleep when</v>

410
00:20:06.361 --> 00:20:09.080
<v Speaker 2>you're just walking around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a,</v>

411
00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:14.540
<v Speaker 2>I mostly just don't like the idea of</v>
<v Speaker 2>anytime there's like another Clinton or</v>

412
00:20:15.031 --> 00:20:17.940
<v Speaker 2>another Bush just because like someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>else,</v>

413
00:20:17.941 --> 00:20:21.060
<v Speaker 2>their father made it or her husband or</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever else made it.</v>

414
00:20:21.061 --> 00:20:23.530
<v Speaker 2>So now they also get to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

415
00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:24.480
<v Speaker 2>and people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

416
00:20:24.481 --> 00:20:27.180
<v Speaker 2>I remember that name change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

417
00:20:27.181 --> 00:20:28.730
<v Speaker 2>that's why we keep doing spiderman</v>
<v Speaker 2>movies.</v>

418
00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:31.210
<v Speaker 2>There's another spiderman reboot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to reboot the whole.</v>

419
00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:32.671
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what we do.</v>

420
00:20:32.671 --> 00:20:35.290
<v Speaker 2>We like to reboot things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many King Kong?</v>

421
00:20:35.291 --> 00:20:37.530
<v Speaker 2>So they made it's fucking crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

422
00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:39.990
<v Speaker 2>a gang of the hawks.</v>

423
00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:42.720
<v Speaker 2>There's three different guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have been the hook in modern days.</v>

424
00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:44.100
<v Speaker 2>Eric Bana,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

425

<v Speaker 2>campaign.</v>

429
00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:55.680
<v Speaker 2>He's very politically active.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That microflow guy.</v>

430
00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:58.750
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people that don't</v>

461
00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:07.893
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

462
00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:11.350
<v Speaker 2>Natasha zero and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Moshe,</v>

463
00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:12.213
<v Speaker 2>Moshe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kasher.</v>

464
00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:15.450
<v Speaker 2>They call a like game of thrones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They call it make them ups.</v>

465
00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:19.980
<v Speaker 2>They don't like fiction things because</v>
<v Speaker 2>he could just make up anything.</v>

466
00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:21.880
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now the dragon comes at Eatsa.</v>

467
00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:27.100
<v Speaker 2>I love it on TV and I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that if I read more fiction I</v>

468
00:22:27.101 --> 00:22:28.180
<v Speaker 2>would have a.</v>

469
00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:31.420
<v Speaker 2>I think it would help my vocabulary and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

470
00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:35.080
<v Speaker 2>I'd be a better communicator possibly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just don't attach to it.</v>

471
00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:36.393
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like it.</v>

472
00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:39.760
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like a preposterous science fictiony</v>

473
00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:42.710
<v Speaker 2>type stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that would be my way in like</v>

474
00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:46.000
<v Speaker 2>stuff that dealing with physics and</v>
<v Speaker 2>future and technology stuff.</v>

475
00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:49.270
<v Speaker 2>I like horror ones too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was always a huge Stephen King fan</v>

476
00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:52.240
<v Speaker 2>just because it's just such a escape,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

477
00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:56.080
<v Speaker 2>like to read about something that's just</v>
<v Speaker 2>fun but crazy,</v>

478
00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:58.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just get lost in someone else's</v>

479
00:22:58.901 --> 00:23:01.450
<v Speaker 2>ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone else's creativity and the only</v>

480
00:23:01.451 --> 00:23:06.070
<v Speaker 2>way they really get to express it fully</v>
<v Speaker 2>is to just make up an entire world,</v>

481
00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:07.780
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas like if someone.</v>

482
00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:09.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you obviously your creative when you</v>

483
00:23:09.941 --> 00:23:12.280
<v Speaker 2>write a book about anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could write a book about nature.</v>

484
00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:15.540
<v Speaker 2>He could be a wildlife biologist that</v>
<v Speaker 2>writes an amazing book about nature and</v>

485
00:23:15.541 --> 00:23:18.850
<v Speaker 2>you can be creative in your telling of</v>
<v Speaker 2>these stories and make it exciting.</v>

486
00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:23.850
<v Speaker 2>But this is kind of a difference to me</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I'm listening to a song or I'm</v>

487
00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:29.040
<v Speaker 2>watching a movie or reading a book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always try to think this is someone's</v>

488
00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:32.050
<v Speaker 2>creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this is coming out of a person's</v>

489
00:23:32.051 --> 00:23:35.050
<v Speaker 2>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Invented this whole idea.</v>

490
00:23:35.051 --> 00:23:36.480
<v Speaker 2>That's the premise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

491
00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:38.110
<v Speaker 2>That's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To me,</v>

492
00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:43.380
<v Speaker 2>you don't have a mind for that for well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like people who are into like creating</v>

493
00:23:43.931 --> 00:23:48.931
<v Speaker 2>movies especially think that's a very</v>
<v Speaker 2>specific mindset of like looking at all</v>

494
00:23:49.521 --> 00:23:50.960
<v Speaker 2>these different things and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

495
00:23:50.961 --> 00:23:54.800
<v Speaker 2>I've got to piece these together and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to have an arc and you have to have</v>

496
00:23:54.801 --> 00:23:56.750
<v Speaker 2>a hero and I have to have with this and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to have a.</v>

497
00:23:57.050 --> 00:23:58.070
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do I,</v>

498
00:23:58.100 --> 00:23:59.900
<v Speaker 2>how do I mix this up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do I make it good?</v>

499
00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:04.730
<v Speaker 2>I know that's like when I watch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I watch like Christopher Nolan or,</v>

500
00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:07.370
<v Speaker 2>or Quintin Tarantino or something like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

501
00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:08.780
<v Speaker 2>like the story is so good.</v>

502
00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:11.270
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll like get teary eyed just at the</v>

503
00:24:11.271 --> 00:24:12.890
<v Speaker 2>story structure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

504
00:24:12.891 --> 00:24:15.020
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it'll end up being like,</v>

505
00:24:15.021 --> 00:24:18.740
<v Speaker 2>that was perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly how it needed to end and</v>

506
00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:22.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm blown away by that and jealous</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I can't imagine myself ever</v>

507
00:24:22.821 --> 00:24:24.390
<v Speaker 2>thinking of anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

508
00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:25.880
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some movies that you just walk</v>

509
00:24:25.881 --> 00:24:28.400
<v Speaker 2>out of there you like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do better at whatever I do</v>

510
00:24:28.401 --> 00:24:29.990
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw that movie.</v>

511
00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:31.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You only used to tell me all the time</v>

512
00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:35.300
<v Speaker 2>that all the time it was Paul Mooney,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paul Mooney used to always say that when</v>

513
00:24:35.301 --> 00:24:37.340
<v Speaker 2>he wanted to write,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would go get entertained.</v>

514
00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:39.080
<v Speaker 2>It goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go see a show,</v>

515
00:24:39.081 --> 00:24:40.940
<v Speaker 2>go see a live show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to the movies,</v>

516
00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:42.170
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go be entertained,</v>

517
00:24:42.171 --> 00:24:43.820
<v Speaker 2>and then you'll write better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

518
00:24:43.821 --> 00:24:44.461
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

519
00:24:44.461 --> 00:24:46.040
<v Speaker 2>I thought that with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I,</v>

520
00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:50.420
<v Speaker 2>when I kind of got into doing more</v>
<v Speaker 2>science stuff with my work rather than</v>

521
00:24:50.421 --> 00:24:52.290
<v Speaker 2>just straight stand up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

522
00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:54.080
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

<v Speaker 2>say Kratom I think we call Kratom and</v>

531
00:25:12.891 --> 00:25:15.770
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

550
00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:06.410
<v Speaker 2>I still have some pain management issues</v>
<v Speaker 2>from an injury and the injury because</v>

551
00:26:06.411 --> 00:26:07.670
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

554
00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:16.520
<v Speaker 2>I was in the best shape of my life and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was rock climbing like three,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it was that much.</v>

576
00:27:25.981 --> 00:27:27.770
<v Speaker 4>It was significant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>

577
00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:32.780
<v Speaker 4>well over a hundred pounds</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he and then he.</v>

578
00:27:33.871 --> 00:27:37.890
<v Speaker 4>So then he started doing like Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of like becoming active for the</v>

579
00:27:37.891 --> 00:27:41.310
<v Speaker 4>first time in his life and was like all</v>
<v Speaker 4>excited about this.</v>

580
00:27:41.311 --> 00:27:42.720
<v Speaker 4>And so he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

581
00:27:42.721 --> 00:27:45.180
<v Speaker 4>I have this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's this one shortcut that I want to</v>

582
00:27:45.181 --> 00:27:47.180
<v Speaker 4>take my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my wife will never let me,</v>

583
00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:50.040
<v Speaker 4>so let's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's go ahead and do that now.</v>

584
00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:52.710
<v Speaker 4>And I liked that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It let me take a shortcut because it was</v>

585
00:27:52.711 --> 00:27:57.090
<v Speaker 4>too high of a jump and then I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we got to this and um,</v>

586
00:27:57.150 --> 00:27:59.220
<v Speaker 4>and I looked and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

587
00:27:59.221 --> 00:28:01.350
<v Speaker 4>that's too high.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he was like,</v>

588
00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:03.720
<v Speaker 4>so because he's been so huge his whole</v>
<v Speaker 4>life,</v>

589
00:28:03.721 --> 00:28:07.720
<v Speaker 4>he has no idea of how high you can jump</v>
<v Speaker 4>from like this.</v>

590
00:28:08.530 --> 00:28:12.650
<v Speaker 4>He's never been able to show before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

591
00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:15.180
<v Speaker 4>and I know because I'm an adrenaline</v>
<v Speaker 4>junkie,</v>

592
00:28:15.181 --> 00:28:18.120
<v Speaker 4>I love heights.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been climbing trees and jumping off</v>

593
00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:20.970
<v Speaker 4>shit my whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

594
00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:23.310
<v Speaker 4>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is too high.</v>

595
00:28:23.311 --> 00:28:23.931
<v Speaker 4>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

596
00:28:23.931 --> 00:28:26.260
<v Speaker 4>I think if we like climb down a little</v>
<v Speaker 4>it be okay.</v>

597
00:28:26.261 --> 00:28:27.210
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

598
00:28:27.410 --> 00:28:31.860
<v Speaker 4>And I was wearing barefoot running shoes</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the time and then he was determined</v>

599
00:28:31.861 --> 00:28:35.670
<v Speaker 4>he was going to do it in high psych,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it was jumping from a cliff onto</v>

600
00:28:35.671 --> 00:28:36.504
<v Speaker 4>another cliff.</v>

601
00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:41.900
<v Speaker 4>And so if you couldn't roll and if you</v>
<v Speaker 4>landed it wrong and you rolled off,</v>

602
00:28:43.231 --> 00:28:46.700
<v Speaker 4>it was like death on hundreds of feet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

603
00:28:47.530 --> 00:28:49.200
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so now I'm like,</v>

604
00:28:49.201 --> 00:28:54.201
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna Watch this guy roll off this</v>
<v Speaker 4>cliff because he's new to like physical</v>

605
00:28:54.481 --> 00:28:56.430
<v Speaker 4>activity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't know what the fuck he's</v>

606
00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:58.590
<v Speaker 4>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he's about to jump off this thing.</v>

607
00:28:58.591 --> 00:29:02.400
<v Speaker 4>That's the lie on the other side.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's been carrying around an extra 100</v>

608
00:29:02.401 --> 00:29:05.340
<v Speaker 4>plus pounds on his legs his whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His legs are probably strong as hell.</v>

609
00:29:05.341 --> 00:29:05.971
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

610
00:29:05.971 --> 00:29:07.740
<v Speaker 4>I imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

611
00:29:07.741 --> 00:29:11.490
<v Speaker 4>it was weird because he had like weird</v>
<v Speaker 4>skin hanging off everywhere.</v>

612
00:29:11.491 --> 00:29:15.030
<v Speaker 4>It's tough from a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like stretch marks and stuff.</v>

613
00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:16.350
<v Speaker 4>But he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

614
00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:19.230
<v Speaker 4>so he was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was determined and I was like,</v>

615
00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:20.970
<v Speaker 4>I was looking at it and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>

616
00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:22.920
<v Speaker 4>I think that I could make it.</v>

617
00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:24.410
<v Speaker 4>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I can,</v>

618
00:29:24.650 --> 00:29:28.560
<v Speaker 4>I can like at least be there so he make</v>
<v Speaker 4>sure he doesn't roll off this fucking</v>

619
00:29:28.561 --> 00:29:29.970
<v Speaker 4>cliff up front of me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>God.</v>

620
00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:31.670
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

621
00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:32.491
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

622
00:29:32.491 --> 00:29:34.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of those things you feel like a</v>

623
00:29:34.021 --> 00:29:36.990
<v Speaker 4>fool in hindsight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

624
00:29:36.991 --> 00:29:37.590
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>

625
00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:41.010
<v Speaker 4>I've jumped off stuff higher than this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just that I'm wearing bad shoes.</v>

626
00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:43.510
<v Speaker 4>I can't roll.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to have to take with my feet.</v>

627
00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:45.100
<v Speaker 4>And I even told them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

628
00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:49.750
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to be risking breaking a heel</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I broke a heel once before when</v>

629
00:29:49.751 --> 00:29:51.760
<v Speaker 4>I was a teenager.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love jumping off shit.</v>

630
00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:54.190
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so,</v>

631
00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:56.950
<v Speaker 4>but it wasn't like the end of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

632
00:29:56.951 --> 00:29:57.580
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if that,</v>

633
00:29:57.580 --> 00:29:59.980
<v Speaker 4>if I break a hail,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it won't,</v>

634
00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:03.820
<v Speaker 4>I'll still be able to get around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just like a couple month thing.</v>

635
00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:04.720
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in my mind,</v>

636
00:30:04.721 --> 00:30:06.700
<v Speaker 4>this is the worst of what's going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>happen.</v>

637
00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:12.360
<v Speaker 4>And so I went for it and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I jumped and I landed.</v>

638
00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:14.380
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then,</v>

639
00:30:14.650 --> 00:30:16.420
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as soon as I landed,</v>

640
00:30:16.421 --> 00:30:19.330
<v Speaker 4>I heard both of my heels break.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

641
00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:22.810
<v Speaker 4>it just the sound shot through my body</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I heard it,</v>

642
00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:26.770
<v Speaker 4>it sounded like a branch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like snapping underwater and,</v>

643
00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:29.860
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>

644
00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:32.990
<v Speaker 4>I think I was in shock or something</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I just kind of turned and looked</v>

645
00:30:32.991 --> 00:30:35.950
<v Speaker 4>down on my side.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just broke both my heels and I started</v>

646
00:30:35.951 --> 00:30:38.080
<v Speaker 4>just like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so he thought I was like joking.</v>

647
00:30:38.081 --> 00:30:39.430
<v Speaker 4>So he was just about to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

648
00:30:39.431 --> 00:30:39.701
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

649
00:30:39.701 --> 00:30:41.590
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really broke both my heels.</v>

650
00:30:41.591 --> 00:30:44.530
<v Speaker 4>You're going to have to go around and</v>
<v Speaker 4>try to help me down.</v>

651
00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:46.650
<v Speaker 4>And I started making my way down.</v>

652
00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:49.720
<v Speaker 4>It took them like a half hour,</v>
<v Speaker 4>45 minutes to get to me and I had to</v>

653
00:30:49.721 --> 00:30:52.630
<v Speaker 4>kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you remember when you were in school</v>

654
00:30:52.631 --> 00:30:56.030
<v Speaker 4>and gym class to be able to do that crab</v>
<v Speaker 4>block thing where like your bellies</v>

655
00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:57.970
<v Speaker 4>facing the air?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

656
00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:02.860
<v Speaker 4>so I had my left foot just was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was already like five times that size</v>

657
00:31:02.861 --> 00:31:06.700
<v Speaker 4>within like 30 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I couldn't use that at all.</v>

658
00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:08.350
<v Speaker 4>And then my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my right foot,</v>

659
00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:10.660
<v Speaker 4>it's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't even tell if it was totally</v>

660

<v Speaker 4>broken or bruised,</v>
<v Speaker 4>real bad buys,</v>

661

<v Speaker 4>And so I had to Kinda like a w,</v>

662
00:31:17.890 --> 00:31:22.890
<v Speaker 4>one foot crab walk down and then he got</v>
<v Speaker 4>around to me and was like a couple of</v>

663
00:31:24.541 --> 00:31:28.180
<v Speaker 4>people were trying to help me for a</v>
<v Speaker 4>little bit too steep for anyone to help</v>

664
00:31:28.181 --> 00:31:30.160
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I just kinda had to make it down on</v>

<v Speaker 4>which took like three hours of just like</v>

<v Speaker 4>I'd have to take a break for a few</v>

<v Speaker 4>your heels and like 20 pieces.</v>

690
00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:51.980
<v Speaker 4>Oh Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>give extra so I could freak out.</v>

691
00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:53.120
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's um,</v>

692
00:32:53.150 --> 00:32:54.840
<v Speaker 4>it's actually the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the uh,</v>

693
00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:57.940
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I made an album about it called my big</v>

694
00:32:57.960 --> 00:33:02.960
<v Speaker 4>break and that's Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the cover art as the x ray of,</v>

695
00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:06.770
<v Speaker 4>of my heel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So say x Ray postsurgery.</v>

696
00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:08.390
<v Speaker 4>It's got all the screws and plates in</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

697
00:33:08.430 --> 00:33:09.410
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

698
00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:10.550
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

699
00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:12.740
<v Speaker 4>I imagine I have the originals around</v>
<v Speaker 4>somewhere.</v>

700
00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:17.090
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm maybe somewhere way back in my</v>

701
00:33:17.091 --> 00:33:20.000
<v Speaker 4>facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could see some of the scars and</v>

702
00:33:20.001 --> 00:33:21.650
<v Speaker 4>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's real grill,</v>

703
00:33:21.651 --> 00:33:23.450
<v Speaker 4>so I'm not sure if you'd be able to find</v>
<v Speaker 4>it or not.</v>

704
00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:25.400
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

705
00:33:25.401 --> 00:33:25.971
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

706
00:33:25.971 --> 00:33:30.971
<v Speaker 4>so they put these metal plates in and</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of screwed in the pieces of the</v>

707
00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:33.290
<v Speaker 4>bigger pieces of bone that were still</v>
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>

708
00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:36.530
<v Speaker 4>like where they wanted them to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>eventually because it's,</v>

709
00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:38.690
<v Speaker 4>you can't just put the bone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like if you,</v>

710
00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:41.810
<v Speaker 4>if you snap like a candy bar and try to</v>
<v Speaker 4>put it together,</v>

711
00:33:41.811 --> 00:33:43.940
<v Speaker 4>there's all these crumbs and stuff like</v>
<v Speaker 4>that missing.</v>

712
00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:47.330
<v Speaker 4>And so they just kind of put it in place</v>
<v Speaker 4>where it was supposed to be.</v>

713
00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:48.530
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

714
00:33:48.531 --> 00:33:50.150
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they were like,</v>

715
00:33:50.151 --> 00:33:53.060
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hopefully it just kinda grows back and</v>

716
00:33:53.150 --> 00:33:54.830
<v Speaker 4>comes together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

717
00:33:55.010 --> 00:33:56.870
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it did,</v>

718
00:33:57.010 --> 00:34:00.860
<v Speaker 4>it really the real issue was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they,</v>

719
00:34:00.861 --> 00:34:03.680
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way they did the surgery,</v>

720
00:34:03.681 --> 00:34:05.510
<v Speaker 4>they told me ahead of time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ladies and gentlemen,</v>

721
00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:06.650
<v Speaker 4>it's a first,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you see that,</v>

722
00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:08.810
<v Speaker 4>what am I looking at right here?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

723
00:34:08.811 --> 00:34:11.930
<v Speaker 4>what is it that's the from where they</v>
<v Speaker 4>went in with the surgery.</v>

724
00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:13.790
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

725
00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:15.030
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

726
00:34:15.150 --> 00:34:17.960
<v Speaker 4>they said they didn't want to do the</v>
<v Speaker 4>surgery at first because they're like,</v>

727
00:34:17.961 --> 00:34:21.050
<v Speaker 4>this is really complicated surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if we don't do it,</v>

728
00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.840
<v Speaker 4>don't think you're ever going to walk</v>
<v Speaker 4>right again.</v>

729
00:34:23.930 --> 00:34:26.630
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why did they not want to do they weren't</v>

730
00:34:26.631 --> 00:34:27.980
<v Speaker 4>qualified to do it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that the idea?</v>

731
00:34:27.981 --> 00:34:30.680
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy was like this guy,</v>

732
00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:33.940
<v Speaker 4>I got referrals and this guy was like as</v>
<v Speaker 4>good of theirs.</v>

733
00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:37.310
<v Speaker 4>Theirs go further back than that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's some real disgusting stuff.</v>

734
00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:40.770
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so um,</v>

735
00:34:41.180 --> 00:34:45.320
<v Speaker 4>they just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just the area that it's in and so</v>

736
00:34:45.321 --> 00:34:46.700
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>

737
00:34:46.850 --> 00:34:49.490
<v Speaker 4>it's like a 90 degree angle that they</v>
<v Speaker 4>have to cut in,</v>

738
00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:50.700
<v Speaker 4>in the corner of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

739
00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:51.860
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there we go.</v>

740
00:34:52.850 --> 00:34:54.140
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't look good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That.</v>

741
00:34:54.141 --> 00:34:57.990
<v Speaker 4>And that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was like months and months later</v>

742
00:34:57.990 --> 00:35:00.440
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was post surgery.</v>

743
00:35:00.441 --> 00:35:03.610
<v Speaker 4>This is like four months after the fact</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it looks like what it looked like.</v>

744
00:35:03.830 --> 00:35:05.480
<v Speaker 4>Tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

745
00:35:05.481 --> 00:35:08.560
<v Speaker 4>a lot of scar tissue and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So see where it's open there in that</v>

746
00:35:08.570 --> 00:35:09.680
<v Speaker 4>corner.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ripped open.</v>

747
00:35:09.681 --> 00:35:12.170
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hope this corner doesn't rip open</v>

748
00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:15.830
<v Speaker 4>because this sometimes happens with this</v>
<v Speaker 4>surgery and if it does,</v>

749
00:35:15.831 --> 00:35:17.870
<v Speaker 4>you're going to be really susceptible to</v>
<v Speaker 4>infection.</v>

750
00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:23.030
<v Speaker 4>And so I had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't when I was at the time I</v>

751
00:35:23.031 --> 00:35:26.760
<v Speaker 4>lived in Malibu and my place had like 50</v>
<v Speaker 4>steps and there's no way I could like</v>

752
00:35:26.810 --> 00:35:29.690
<v Speaker 4>get up with groceries and everything</v>
<v Speaker 4>with two broken feet.</v>

753
00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:32.300
<v Speaker 4>I could get around on crutches a little</v>
<v Speaker 4>bit.</v>

754
00:35:32.810 --> 00:35:35.240
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I ended up having to spend like three</v>

755
00:35:35.241 --> 00:35:39.420
<v Speaker 4>months in my parents basement because I</v>
<v Speaker 4>couldn't care for myself or anything.</v>

756
00:35:39.421 --> 00:35:44.421
<v Speaker 4>So like on top of having to cancel three</v>
<v Speaker 4>months of work and not have,</v>

757
00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:48.660
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't have a safety net and having no</v>

758
00:35:48.661 --> 00:35:51.660
<v Speaker 4>income and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>

759
00:35:51.690 --> 00:35:54.320
<v Speaker 4>it was actually like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm very grateful for my parents and</v>

760
00:35:54.321 --> 00:35:55.050
<v Speaker 4>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>

761
00:35:55.050 --> 00:35:57.150
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just embarrassing and you're like,</v>

762
00:35:57.180 --> 00:35:59.130
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had to move him at my parents</v>

763
00:35:59.131 --> 00:36:01.070
<v Speaker 4>basement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure they understand them.</v>

764
00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:03.360
<v Speaker 4>It's not like you just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

765
00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:07.530
<v Speaker 4>we were a loser and wake up on time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lost your apartment,</v>

766
00:36:07.531 --> 00:36:09.960
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is just fuck man.</v>

767
00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:12.900
<v Speaker 4>The worst part to come to start walking</v>
<v Speaker 4>again.</v>

768
00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:18.230
<v Speaker 4>So after three months I got back on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>road and um,</v>

769
00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:23.010
<v Speaker 4>and there was still this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this little kind of wound that it opened</v>

770
00:36:23.011 --> 00:36:25.740
<v Speaker 4>up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wasn't healing and then I started,</v>

771
00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:29.610
<v Speaker 4>it was just taking the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they told me it was going to take like</v>

772
00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:34.640
<v Speaker 4>at least six months to like start</v>
<v Speaker 4>walking and it ended up taking much</v>

773
00:36:35.791 --> 00:36:38.790
<v Speaker 4>longer than that because so about four</v>
<v Speaker 4>or five months in,</v>

774
00:36:38.791 --> 00:36:41.130
<v Speaker 4>I got on the road and then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

775
00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:45.540
<v Speaker 4>and then a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a doctor thought that maybe I was</v>

776
00:36:45.541 --> 00:36:48.180
<v Speaker 4>getting a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like just a topical infection and gave</v>

777
00:36:48.181 --> 00:36:52.500
<v Speaker 4>me some stuff that wasn't good enough</v>
<v Speaker 4>for the infection.</v>

778
00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:53.370
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

779
00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:57.060
<v Speaker 4>I started.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So about four or five months later I</v>

780
00:36:57.061 --> 00:37:01.200
<v Speaker 4>started having fevers and then I went</v>
<v Speaker 4>into the hospital and then they're like,</v>

781
00:37:01.201 --> 00:37:03.390
<v Speaker 4>you have a bone infection.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

782
00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:04.710
<v Speaker 4>Ugh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>God.</v>

783
00:37:04.711 --> 00:37:07.580
<v Speaker 4>Because they are like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is really serious because that's</v>

784
00:37:07.590 --> 00:37:10.770
<v Speaker 4>when you can lose your foot and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If they can't stop the infection,</v>

785
00:37:10.771 --> 00:37:14.310
<v Speaker 4>they just have to cut it off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus came back,</v>

786
00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:16.500
<v Speaker 4>canceled every,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all my work again.</v>

787
00:37:16.830 --> 00:37:21.330
<v Speaker 4>Came back to La.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They did a surgery and um,</v>

788
00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:26.040
<v Speaker 4>and I was really thankful that I'd</v>
<v Speaker 4>happened to sign up for the health care.</v>

789
00:37:26.041 --> 00:37:28.000
<v Speaker 4>This was right when the universal</v>
<v Speaker 4>healthcare,</v>

790
00:37:28.070 --> 00:37:30.300
<v Speaker 4>it just came out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Otherwise I'd be bankrupt from it,</v>

791
00:37:30.301 --> 00:37:34.110
<v Speaker 4>but it was still certainly it was not</v>
<v Speaker 4>perfect at all.</v>

792
00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:35.700
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they wouldn't let me do stuff out of</v>

793
00:37:35.701 --> 00:37:38.370
<v Speaker 4>state.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had to get myself back to California.</v>

794
00:37:38.371 --> 00:37:39.000
<v Speaker 4>And.</v>

795
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.830
<v Speaker 4>And what do you mean by stuff out of</v>
<v Speaker 4>state?</v>

796
00:37:40.831 --> 00:37:44.280
<v Speaker 4>You mean surgical procedure?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Surgery and hospital checkups I had to</v>

797
00:37:44.281 --> 00:37:46.770
<v Speaker 4>pay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like do them in California because of</v>

798
00:37:46.771 --> 00:37:47.790
<v Speaker 4>your insurance?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

799
00:37:47.791 --> 00:37:51.680
<v Speaker 4>And so when I was in Wisconsin I had to</v>
<v Speaker 4>pay out of pocket for that and,</v>

800
00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:54.660
<v Speaker 4>and it's like kind of not supposed to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>that way either,</v>

801
00:37:54.661 --> 00:37:57.210
<v Speaker 4>but there was the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I would,</v>

802
00:37:57.270 --> 00:38:00.150
<v Speaker 4>I would call and try to in the insurance</v>
<v Speaker 4>company will be like,</v>

803
00:38:00.151 --> 00:38:01.620
<v Speaker 4>you need this one form.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

804
00:38:01.621 --> 00:38:03.900
<v Speaker 4>I call this company and they'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

805
00:38:03.930 --> 00:38:07.080
<v Speaker 4>only doctors can get that form.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I'd tell my doctor and he'd be</v>

806
00:38:07.081 --> 00:38:07.561
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

807
00:38:07.561 --> 00:38:09.060
<v Speaker 4>you can get that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to go here.</v>

808
00:38:09.061 --> 00:38:12.570
<v Speaker 4>And then it was like around and around,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes I'd have to like pretend I was</v>

809
00:38:12.571 --> 00:38:15.960
<v Speaker 4>a doctor and then I was on the phone</v>
<v Speaker 4>with people just to get this fucking</v>

810
00:38:15.961 --> 00:38:17.040
<v Speaker 4>form that I need.</v>

811
00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:19.560
<v Speaker 4>And so I paid out of pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I was like,</v>

812
00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:22.350
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting medical bills were piling up.</v>

813
00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:26.430
<v Speaker 4>And so the second surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what they did was they just cut out,</v>

814
00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:28.410
<v Speaker 4>they took out the hardware,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what,</v>

815
00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:32.760
<v Speaker 4>that's what got infected.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then they kind of were where the</v>

816
00:38:32.761 --> 00:38:34.800
<v Speaker 4>holes were from the screws.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

817
00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:39.700
<v Speaker 4>they kind of drill those out a little</v>
<v Speaker 4>bit and then they just cut off it cut as</v>

818
00:38:39.790 --> 00:38:43.990
<v Speaker 4>big of a hole as they possibly could in</v>
<v Speaker 4>my foot to suck out as much of the</v>

819
00:38:43.991 --> 00:38:47.680
<v Speaker 4>infection as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I thought I was going to be in a</v>

820
00:38:47.681 --> 00:38:50.260
<v Speaker 4>hospital for and I still hadn't walked</v>
<v Speaker 4>at this point.</v>

821
00:38:50.261 --> 00:38:51.670
<v Speaker 4>And then I thought I was going to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>

822
00:38:51.671 --> 00:38:55.420
<v Speaker 4>like you'll be in a hospital for like a</v>
<v Speaker 4>week and a half or so,</v>

823
00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:57.220
<v Speaker 4>two weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

824
00:38:57.221 --> 00:38:58.060
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fine.</v>

825
00:38:58.120 --> 00:38:58.950
<v Speaker 4>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm in.</v>

826
00:38:58.950 --> 00:39:00.970
<v Speaker 4>I finally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone's going to be like,</v>

827
00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.100
<v Speaker 4>taking care of me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're just going to get this done,</v>

828
00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:03.610
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

829
00:39:03.610 --> 00:39:06.280
<v Speaker 4>I have my computer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was in good spirits and,</v>

830
00:39:06.330 --> 00:39:08.560
<v Speaker 4>and getting a lot of work done and</v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>

831
00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:11.770
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then like two days later they were</v>

832
00:39:11.771 --> 00:39:14.350
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your insurance is saying that they think</v>

833
00:39:14.351 --> 00:39:18.670
<v Speaker 4>you're better and you need to go home</v>
<v Speaker 4>and now we need to show you how to care</v>

834
00:39:18.671 --> 00:39:22.210
<v Speaker 4>for yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I had to train me on how to.</v>

835
00:39:22.211 --> 00:39:26.020
<v Speaker 4>I had to give Myself Ivy antibiotics</v>
<v Speaker 4>three times a day.</v>

836
00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:27.843
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they had,</v>

837
00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:29.630
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they put ivy,</v>

838
00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:34.270
<v Speaker 4>they put lines in my arm and I had to</v>
<v Speaker 4>like make sure that their sanitary all</v>

839
00:39:34.271 --> 00:39:36.250
<v Speaker 4>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'd have to get a minute.</v>

840
00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:39.520
<v Speaker 4>Hold on a second.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a complex medical procedure.</v>

841
00:39:39.521 --> 00:39:41.950
<v Speaker 4>Giving yourself an ivy dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had to google it.</v>

842
00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:45.400
<v Speaker 4>I like fucking Google.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's the name of your insurance</v>

843
00:39:45.401 --> 00:39:47.020
<v Speaker 4>company?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

844
00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:49.680
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do I have the.</v>

845
00:39:51.610 --> 00:39:53.020
<v Speaker 4>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

846
00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:54.093
<v Speaker 4>the fact I'm trying.</v>

847
00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:58.300
<v Speaker 4>So that's the other thing is I have like</v>
<v Speaker 4>two different insurance companies.</v>

848
00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:02.010
<v Speaker 4>So this is like health net and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's like this lakeside medical,</v>

849
00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:06.970
<v Speaker 4>which one will never know which one is</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the I call one and they'd be like,</v>

850
00:40:06.971 --> 00:40:07.804
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's your,</v>

851
00:40:07.810 --> 00:40:09.430
<v Speaker 4>your other company.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I called the other one.</v>

852
00:40:09.431 --> 00:40:10.264
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's kind of,</v>

853
00:40:10.570 --> 00:40:14.890
<v Speaker 4>it was just a year of dealing with this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So because of the fact that this was so</v>

854
00:40:14.891 --> 00:40:16.450
<v Speaker 4>expensive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they just decided to say,</v>

855
00:40:16.451 --> 00:40:19.120
<v Speaker 4>fuck this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's make him do all the medical stuff</v>

856
00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:20.140
<v Speaker 4>himself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

857
00:40:20.141 --> 00:40:21.970
<v Speaker 4>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have you ever heard of that before?</v>

858
00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:23.770
<v Speaker 4>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well he's a young guy.</v>

859
00:40:23.771 --> 00:40:26.680
<v Speaker 4>He seems like he's in good spirits and</v>
<v Speaker 4>healthy.</v>

860
00:40:26.681 --> 00:40:29.620
<v Speaker 4>Seems like a bright guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he could take care of himself.</v>

861
00:40:29.621 --> 00:40:32.700
<v Speaker 4>I think it was the logic behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so let's,</v>

862
00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:34.900
<v Speaker 4>let's get them out of here because it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>is expensive.</v>

863
00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:36.910
<v Speaker 4>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Could you fight it?</v>

864
00:40:36.970 --> 00:40:38.320
<v Speaker 4>I tried.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

865
00:40:38.321 --> 00:40:39.154
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your,</v>

866
00:40:39.330 --> 00:40:41.950
<v Speaker 4>I can't do this on my own.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then when they showed me what I had to</v>

867
00:40:41.951 --> 00:40:45.400
<v Speaker 4>do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was so once I get the ibs hooked up</v>

868
00:40:45.401 --> 00:40:48.520
<v Speaker 4>and I'd have to figure out how to like</v>
<v Speaker 4>get bubbles out of the lines and stuff</v>

869
00:40:48.521 --> 00:40:49.810
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I was googling,</v>

870
00:40:49.811 --> 00:40:53.540
<v Speaker 4>how do you get bubbles out of the lines</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's literally what I say.</v>

871
00:40:53.830 --> 00:40:57.280
<v Speaker 4>Then I had to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the first time they showed me what I had</v>

872
00:40:57.281 --> 00:40:58.280
<v Speaker 4>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

873
00:40:58.430 --> 00:41:00.010
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>

874
00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:01.510
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>watch this because you're going to have</v>

875
00:41:01.511 --> 00:41:04.990
<v Speaker 4>to do this yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then so this huge hole in my foot</v>

876
00:41:04.991 --> 00:41:08.380
<v Speaker 4>was packed full of gauze and they</v>
<v Speaker 4>started pulling out this gauze.</v>

877
00:41:08.381 --> 00:41:10.510
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know how big the hole was at</v>
<v Speaker 4>first,</v>

878
00:41:10.511 --> 00:41:15.130
<v Speaker 4>but then it was like one of those magic</v>
<v Speaker 4>scarves on calming.</v>

879
00:41:15.250 --> 00:41:17.380
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then they're like,</v>

880
00:41:17.381 --> 00:41:20.290
<v Speaker 4>so you're gonna need to take this out</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then look in here.</v>

881
00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:23.370
<v Speaker 4>Look in your whole.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to need to clean it out and</v>

882
00:41:23.371 --> 00:41:25.700
<v Speaker 4>like clean off your bone and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

883
00:41:25.930 --> 00:41:28.240
<v Speaker 4>everyday you could see your bone it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

884
00:41:28.241 --> 00:41:33.241
<v Speaker 4>I had to like scrub it off and then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I had to pack it full of Shit</v>

885
00:41:34.521 --> 00:41:39.521
<v Speaker 4>again and all of this with like wearing</v>
<v Speaker 4>gloves and a mask and everything like</v>

886
00:41:39.891 --> 00:41:40.724
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

887
00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:44.000
<v Speaker 4>and then I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then I'd have to like put a rubber</v>

888
00:41:44.001 --> 00:41:46.340
<v Speaker 4>thing on to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to take a shower.</v>

889
00:41:46.341 --> 00:41:49.940
<v Speaker 4>I had to do this three times a day and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then I couldn't sleep either because I</v>

890
00:41:49.941 --> 00:41:53.900
<v Speaker 4>needed the IB antibiotics had to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>every eight hours and it took two hours</v>

891
00:41:53.901 --> 00:41:57.140
<v Speaker 4>to do them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I could never get like a full</v>

892
00:41:57.170 --> 00:41:59.180
<v Speaker 4>eight hour rest.</v>

893
00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:02.380
<v Speaker 4>So I was like mad it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

894
00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:05.840
<v Speaker 4>took two hours for the IB fluids to go</v>
<v Speaker 4>in and kick in.</v>

895
00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:06.651
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

896
00:42:06.651 --> 00:42:07.540
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you have to do.</v>

897
00:42:08.010 --> 00:42:10.370
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I'd hang up these bags and stuff.</v>

898
00:42:10.371 --> 00:42:14.510
<v Speaker 4>I'd hook up the ivs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then I'd spend 20 minutes with my foot</v>

899
00:42:15.410 --> 00:42:17.990
<v Speaker 4>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then after,</v>

900
00:42:18.050 --> 00:42:20.420
<v Speaker 4>after like a few weeks of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>see,</v>

901
00:42:20.421 --> 00:42:22.340
<v Speaker 4>they would always be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

902
00:42:22.341 --> 00:42:25.820
<v Speaker 4>we can get you another home visit or</v>
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>

903
00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:30.590
<v Speaker 4>It would be like a week after I actually</v>
<v Speaker 4>needed it because then I got,</v>

904
00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:35.240
<v Speaker 4>I got this vacuum Suction Cup thing that</v>
<v Speaker 4>they put on my feet and um,</v>

905
00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:37.520
<v Speaker 4>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

906
00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:41.720
<v Speaker 4>and it just kind of sucks all the</v>
<v Speaker 4>infection stuff out and,</v>

907
00:42:41.810 --> 00:42:43.330
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

908
00:42:43.420 --> 00:42:44.730
<v Speaker 4>gets,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gets rid of it,</v>

909
00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:48.950
<v Speaker 4>closes up and creates like blood flow</v>
<v Speaker 4>into that area.</v>

910
00:42:48.951 --> 00:42:52.130
<v Speaker 4>So it generates the things that actually</v>
<v Speaker 4>work amazingly well.</v>

911
00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:55.220
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but so then I had this device and like a</v>

912
00:42:55.221 --> 00:42:59.720
<v Speaker 4>vacuum and I started performing again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd have to like take this vacuum off</v>

913
00:42:59.721 --> 00:43:04.721
<v Speaker 4>myself and like close up my fucking foot</v>
<v Speaker 4>hole and then go on stage and perform</v>

914
00:43:05.001 --> 00:43:07.970
<v Speaker 4>and then get off and put this back on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>back on.</v>

915
00:43:07.971 --> 00:43:09.050
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

916
00:43:09.051 --> 00:43:09.940
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

917
00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:15.020
<v Speaker 4>I remember it because I had before I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>before I,</v>

918
00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:18.530
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went through a big breakup,</v>

919
00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:22.190
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>before I broke my feet and when I,</v>

920
00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:24.770
<v Speaker 4>and I had been in like 12 years of</v>
<v Speaker 4>relationships.</v>

921
00:43:24.771 --> 00:43:27.830
<v Speaker 4>And so I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not dating for a year.</v>

922
00:43:27.890 --> 00:43:31.280
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to have sex.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to think about women for a</v>

923
00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:32.810
<v Speaker 4>year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just going to get my head straight</v>

924
00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:37.490
<v Speaker 4>and I did that and it was great and got</v>
<v Speaker 4>tons of work done and then then when I</v>

925
00:43:37.491 --> 00:43:39.840
<v Speaker 4>started getting back into things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>broke feet,</v>

926
00:43:40.070 --> 00:43:43.580
<v Speaker 4>it was a no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had already I broke my feet during</v>

927
00:43:43.581 --> 00:43:44.320
<v Speaker 4>this time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which,</v>

928
00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:47.990
<v Speaker 4>which helped when like can you just</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't have a sex drive with both of your</v>

929
00:43:47.991 --> 00:43:50.930
<v Speaker 4>feet are broken and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then,</v>

930
00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:54.710
<v Speaker 4>but when I started getting back into it</v>
<v Speaker 4>and like I remember I brought a girl</v>

931
00:43:54.711 --> 00:43:58.700
<v Speaker 4>back back to my hotel when I still had</v>
<v Speaker 4>this fucking vacuum,</v>

932
00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:02.060
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on my foot and I was just like,</v>

933
00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:06.290
<v Speaker 4>it was fucking awkward and I hadn't had</v>
<v Speaker 4>sex in like a year or two.</v>

934
00:44:06.290 --> 00:44:08.450
<v Speaker 4>So I'm like trying to figure out how to</v>
<v Speaker 4>have sex again.</v>

935
00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:11.630
<v Speaker 4>I got a fucking vacuum attached to my</v>
<v Speaker 4>foot hole.</v>

936
00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:13.320
<v Speaker 4>Was your health like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

937
00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:15.420
<v Speaker 4>what kind of like energy levels did you</v>
<v Speaker 4>have?</v>

938
00:44:15.421 --> 00:44:16.940
<v Speaker 4>It would seem like if you're going</v>
<v Speaker 4>through,</v>

939
00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:20.090
<v Speaker 4>your body's trying to repair itself for</v>
<v Speaker 4>such a long period of time it has to</v>

940
00:44:20.091 --> 00:44:20.960
<v Speaker 4>wear on you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

941
00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:22.820
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

942
00:44:22.850 --> 00:44:25.970
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was more just the depression of it</v>

943
00:44:26.090 --> 00:44:27.650
<v Speaker 4>all in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the stress was,</v>

944
00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:30.740
<v Speaker 4>was harder than I was getting plenty of</v>
<v Speaker 4>sleep and stuff,</v>

945
00:44:30.741 --> 00:44:32.550
<v Speaker 4>but was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a depressing time,</v>

946
00:44:32.551 --> 00:44:37.551
<v Speaker 4>but ultimately it was kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was kind of good in a way in building</v>

947
00:44:38.020 --> 00:44:39.870
<v Speaker 4>and some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a little bit.</v>

948
00:44:39.930 --> 00:44:41.150
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

949
00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:43.740
<v Speaker 4>I got a good elvanto um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

950
00:44:44.310 --> 00:44:47.280
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean when I started in Boston and I</v>

951
00:44:47.281 --> 00:44:49.620
<v Speaker 4>started doing comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was fearless.</v>

952
00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:53.970
<v Speaker 4>I would do like a ballsiest stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>always trying new material and I just</v>

953
00:44:53.971 --> 00:44:58.170
<v Speaker 4>did not give a shit and I got a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 4>attention for it and I caught some</v>

954
00:44:58.171 --> 00:45:02.820
<v Speaker 4>breaks early on and once I started</v>
<v Speaker 4>making money and doing the road it was</v>

955
00:45:02.821 --> 00:45:05.910
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you're worried about like getting</v>

956
00:45:05.911 --> 00:45:10.110
<v Speaker 4>negative comment cards and all this shit</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's like my livelihood.</v>

957
00:45:10.111 --> 00:45:12.660
<v Speaker 4>And it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was just watering down what I was</v>

958
00:45:12.661 --> 00:45:15.480
<v Speaker 4>doing and I wasn't fearless on stage</v>
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>

959
00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:16.920
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

960
00:45:17.310 --> 00:45:20.700
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so after breaking my feet and having</v>

961
00:45:20.701 --> 00:45:22.890
<v Speaker 4>three months of my parents' house,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it kind of was just like,</v>

962
00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:26.580
<v Speaker 4>I don't give a fuck anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just doing exactly what I want to do</v>

963
00:45:26.910 --> 00:45:28.620
<v Speaker 4>and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>

964
00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:30.640
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it really created a change in,</v>

965
00:45:30.810 --> 00:45:33.240
<v Speaker 4>in my career.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought that album and like the new</v>

966
00:45:33.241 --> 00:45:36.120
<v Speaker 4>act that I'm doing now or the best that</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've ever been.</v>

967
00:45:36.270 --> 00:45:38.880
<v Speaker 4>How long ago was the incident and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>accident?</v>

968
00:45:38.910 --> 00:45:41.520
<v Speaker 4>And how long did it take you to recover?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

969
00:45:41.550 --> 00:45:43.620
<v Speaker 4>so it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was two years ago,</v>

970
00:45:43.890 --> 00:45:45.420
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in May.</v>

971
00:45:45.690 --> 00:45:50.690
<v Speaker 4>And then I about one year in I started</v>
<v Speaker 4>using a cane and then that's when I,</v>

972
00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:58.260
<v Speaker 4>that was really hard when I started</v>
<v Speaker 4>using a cane because I was like,</v>

973
00:45:58.261 --> 00:46:00.030
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the light at the end of the tunnel.</v>

974
00:46:00.031 --> 00:46:01.350
<v Speaker 4>And then I realized,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

975
00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:06.440
<v Speaker 4>every other step that I take for the</v>
<v Speaker 4>rest of my life I think is going to hurt</v>

976
00:46:06.570 --> 00:46:08.820
<v Speaker 4>just every other step.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so it's like always.</v>

977
00:46:09.210 --> 00:46:11.830
<v Speaker 4>That's why,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's why I take kratom before podcasts</v>

978
00:46:11.850 --> 00:46:15.090
<v Speaker 4>because there's always a part of my</v>
<v Speaker 4>brain that can't stop talk.</v>

979
00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:18.300
<v Speaker 4>I can't stop thinking about my stupid</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking foot.</v>

980
00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:21.000
<v Speaker 4>Is it hurting you right now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

981
00:46:21.001 --> 00:46:22.290
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right now it feels fine,</v>

982
00:46:22.291 --> 00:46:24.280
<v Speaker 4>but when you would walk here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

983
00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:26.640
<v Speaker 4>well the Kratom helps,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if I,</v>

984
00:46:26.641 --> 00:46:31.641
<v Speaker 4>if I'm not on that most days it's just</v>
<v Speaker 4>like having a pretty sore foot and then</v>

985
00:46:32.281 --> 00:46:36.240
<v Speaker 4>some days,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like probably now it's coming along</v>

986
00:46:36.241 --> 00:46:39.150
<v Speaker 4>better than I thought it would actually</v>
<v Speaker 4>about three days out of a month.</v>

987
00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:41.760
<v Speaker 4>I have like this streak and I don't know</v>
<v Speaker 4>what causes it.</v>

988
00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:43.500
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it's inactivity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the weather,</v>

989
00:46:43.501 --> 00:46:46.110
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a streak of like three days where</v>

990
00:46:46.111 --> 00:46:48.930
<v Speaker 4>I can just be where I should be using a</v>
<v Speaker 4>cane again,</v>

991
00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:51.780
<v Speaker 4>where if you saw me it'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's wrong with that guy?</v>

992
00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:53.310
<v Speaker 4>Years later?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

993
00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:54.920
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

994
00:46:54.930 --> 00:46:57.300
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>about a year and a half after I started</v>

995
00:46:57.301 --> 00:47:00.900
<v Speaker 4>using a cane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I was on a cane for about six months</v>

996
00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:04.500
<v Speaker 4>and then I started going without the</v>
<v Speaker 4>cane and just using it sometimes.</v>

997
00:47:04.830 --> 00:47:06.330
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

998
00:47:06.331 --> 00:47:10.910
<v Speaker 4>So it's been quite an ordeal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you doing any exercising?</v>

999
00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:13.560
<v Speaker 4>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm as crazy as this might sound.</v>

1000
00:47:13.850 --> 00:47:16.700
<v Speaker 4>I got back into rock climbing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1001
00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:19.230
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know how that sounds.</v>

1002
00:47:19.470 --> 00:47:23.130
<v Speaker 4>Hear me out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I only do indoor stuff.</v>

1003
00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:26.430
<v Speaker 4>So here's what I can't do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't run or jump,</v>

1004
00:47:26.460 --> 00:47:28.710
<v Speaker 4>I can't do any quick activities and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>couldn't,</v>

1005
00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:31.570
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't do like squats or anything</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that on it.</v>

1006
00:47:31.890 --> 00:47:35.350
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what I can do is slow,</v>

1007
00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:39.100
<v Speaker 4>deliberate movement that will help with</v>
<v Speaker 4>flexibility.</v>

1008
00:47:39.101 --> 00:47:44.101
<v Speaker 4>Right now it's mostly flexibility and</v>
<v Speaker 4>mobility issues and nerve damage issues</v>

1009
00:47:44.741 --> 00:47:46.270
<v Speaker 4>like the bones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Totally fine.</v>

1010
00:47:46.330 --> 00:47:47.470
<v Speaker 4>Can you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1011
00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:51.010
<v Speaker 4>stand on your tippy toes?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can you stand on the balls of your feet?</v>

1012
00:47:51.250 --> 00:47:55.870
<v Speaker 4>I can a little bit on my bad foot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't do like a,</v>

1013
00:47:55.930 --> 00:47:59.520
<v Speaker 4>I can't do a calf raise like a one</v>
<v Speaker 4>legged calf raise on you.</v>

1014
00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:05.220
<v Speaker 6>Could you bend down with your heels up?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Could you go all the way down?</v>

1015
00:48:05.550 --> 00:48:08.570
<v Speaker 6>Like could you stay on the balls of your</v>
<v Speaker 6>feet and then</v>

1016
00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:10.690
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>down in the squat position with your</v>

1017
00:48:10.691 --> 00:48:13.990
<v Speaker 4>heels off the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a little bit</v>

1018
00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:16.510
<v Speaker 6>what I was thinking of.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a thing called the Hindu squat</v>

1019
00:48:16.690 --> 00:48:20.140
<v Speaker 6>and what a Hindu squad is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a bodyweight squat and I'm a big</v>

1020
00:48:20.141 --> 00:48:21.400
<v Speaker 6>proponent of it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I love them.</v>

1021
00:48:21.401 --> 00:48:26.050
<v Speaker 6>I do them all the time and I do them in</v>
<v Speaker 6>sets of like 150,</v>

1022
00:48:26.051 --> 00:48:28.510
<v Speaker 6>160.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sometimes when I'm in really good shape,</v>

1023
00:48:28.540 --> 00:48:33.520
<v Speaker 6>I do 200 at a time and then I do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is my main leg workouts.</v>

1024
00:48:33.521 --> 00:48:36.460
<v Speaker 6>I do those and then I do kettle bell</v>
<v Speaker 6>squats afterwards,</v>

1025
00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:39.640
<v Speaker 6>but the thing about the Hindu squats is</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's all body weight.</v>

1026
00:48:39.910 --> 00:48:42.010
<v Speaker 6>You don't use any weight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sometimes I put a weight vest on,</v>

1027
00:48:42.011 --> 00:48:43.810
<v Speaker 6>but most of the time I don't do any</v>
<v Speaker 6>weight,</v>

1028
00:48:43.811 --> 00:48:45.400
<v Speaker 6>but if you look at that diagram up</v>
<v Speaker 6>there,</v>

1029
00:48:45.610 --> 00:48:50.350
<v Speaker 6>you see when you go down your heels come</v>
<v Speaker 6>off the ground,</v>

1030
00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:55.560
<v Speaker 6>your hands go behind your heels and then</v>
<v Speaker 6>as you go up your hands stay parallel to</v>

1031
00:48:55.931 --> 00:48:58.120
<v Speaker 6>the floor in front of you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So you go.</v>

1032
00:48:58.121 --> 00:49:00.470
<v Speaker 6>As you go up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you push off with the balls of your feet</v>

1033
00:49:00.471 --> 00:49:02.690
<v Speaker 6>and not with your heel.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So as opposed to a regular,</v>

1034
00:49:02.970 --> 00:49:05.140
<v Speaker 6>a regular squat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Rather if you had weight behind your</v>

1035
00:49:05.141 --> 00:49:08.560
<v Speaker 6>back with a bar,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that weight would be on your heel.</v>

1036
00:49:08.620 --> 00:49:11.320
<v Speaker 6>You would actually concentrate on</v>
<v Speaker 6>keeping it on your heel,</v>

1037
00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:13.410
<v Speaker 6>concentrated on keeping your.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1038
00:49:13.450 --> 00:49:16.210
<v Speaker 6>when I do squats with weight,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I look up,</v>

1039
00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:18.980
<v Speaker 6>look straight up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so I make sure that my spines and</v>

1040
00:49:18.981 --> 00:49:20.680
<v Speaker 6>alignment,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but there's a lot of weight on your heel</v>

1041
00:49:20.681 --> 00:49:21.130
<v Speaker 6>there.</v>

1042
00:49:21.130 --> 00:49:21.760
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1043
00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:23.260
<v Speaker 4>With the squats.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1044
00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:27.460
<v Speaker 4>actually that doesn't the weight on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>heel that like the heels totally fine.</v>

1045
00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:28.690
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1046
00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:33.610
<v Speaker 4>it's more of a mobility issue and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and like all the tendons and stuff like</v>

1047
00:49:33.611 --> 00:49:36.700
<v Speaker 4>that that they went through during the</v>
<v Speaker 4>surgery and all the nerve damage from</v>

1048
00:49:36.701 --> 00:49:39.490
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like actually going up on my toes is,</v>

1049
00:49:39.550 --> 00:49:43.720
<v Speaker 4>is one of the harder parts maybe be a</v>
<v Speaker 4>good thing to break everything up in</v>

1050
00:49:43.721 --> 00:49:44.950
<v Speaker 4>there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1051
00:49:45.130 --> 00:49:47.710
<v Speaker 4>it does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I do like a really intense hike,</v>

1052
00:49:48.010 --> 00:49:50.110
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my foot feels better.</v>

1053
00:49:50.440 --> 00:49:51.340
<v Speaker 4>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1054
00:49:51.341 --> 00:49:53.230
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well you should definitely do these then</v>

1055
00:49:53.670 --> 00:49:57.580
<v Speaker 4>I guarantee you they would help.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to get on the fucking Joe Rogan</v>

1056
00:49:57.640 --> 00:49:59.200
<v Speaker 4>program it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tell it,</v>

1057
00:49:59.410 --> 00:50:00.250
<v Speaker 4>tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1058
00:50:00.310 --> 00:50:02.380
<v Speaker 4>give me a rundown.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything I needed to do.</v>

1059
00:50:02.381 --> 00:50:05.740
<v Speaker 4>I want to start a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was in the best shape of my life and</v>

1060
00:50:05.790 --> 00:50:08.500
<v Speaker 4>in this whole thing it made me fall out</v>
<v Speaker 4>of all of it.</v>

1061
00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:10.390
<v Speaker 4>And I would love to get back there again</v>

1062
00:50:10.490 --> 00:50:13.770
<v Speaker 6>to you if it's just a mobility issue,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you don't have actual pain,</v>

1063
00:50:13.771 --> 00:50:15.600
<v Speaker 6>your heel,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I bet you can get back to it because I</v>

1064
00:50:15.601 --> 00:50:17.760
<v Speaker 6>know a lot of guys have plates all over</v>
<v Speaker 6>their body.</v>

1065
00:50:18.530 --> 00:50:21.870
<v Speaker 6>They have all sorts of different things</v>
<v Speaker 6>holding their bones together and they</v>

1066
00:50:21.871 --> 00:50:22.440
<v Speaker 6>get back.</v>

1067
00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:23.490
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I do.</v>

1068
00:50:23.491 --> 00:50:27.380
<v Speaker 4>I need to like break up the scar tissue</v>
<v Speaker 4>and all that kind of stuff to see woman</v>

1069
00:50:27.381 --> 00:50:28.160
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1070
00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:31.340
<v Speaker 3>She's doing it wrong because you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually supposed to go on the balls of</v>

1071
00:50:31.341 --> 00:50:36.341
<v Speaker 3>your feet and you're supposed to drop</v>
<v Speaker 3>your ass all the way down to the back of</v>

1072
00:50:36.651 --> 00:50:40.940
<v Speaker 3>your calves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People doing youtube things that to do</v>

1073
00:50:40.941 --> 00:50:43.370
<v Speaker 3>it right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a guy named Matt fury is kind of</v>

1074
00:50:43.371 --> 00:50:44.990
<v Speaker 3>an odd duck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

1075
00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:47.870
<v Speaker 3>he's a big proponent of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got a bunch of videos of him doing</v>

1076
00:50:47.871 --> 00:50:49.820
<v Speaker 3>it online.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here you go.</v>

1077
00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:51.320
<v Speaker 3>That's how you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See how this guy,</v>

1078
00:50:51.530 --> 00:50:55.860
<v Speaker 3>as he goes down his heels come off the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ground and they touches the ground in a</v>

1079
00:50:55.861 --> 00:50:58.160
<v Speaker 3>circular motion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he brings his arms parallel in</v>

1080
00:50:58.161 --> 00:50:59.750
<v Speaker 3>front of him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are great.</v>

1081
00:50:59.930 --> 00:51:02.150
<v Speaker 3>I think I could do that there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Super easy.</v>

1082
00:51:02.210 --> 00:51:06.330
<v Speaker 3>For the first 10,</v>
<v Speaker 3>20 gets a little harder than than 30.</v>

1083
00:51:06.331 --> 00:51:07.910
<v Speaker 3>He gets a little harder than 40.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a little harder.</v>

1084
00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:10.340
<v Speaker 3>And then he started hitting like 90 and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go,</v>

1085
00:51:10.341 --> 00:51:12.740
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got 60 more of these motherfuckers to</v>

1086
00:51:12.741 --> 00:51:13.790
<v Speaker 3>go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you know,</v>

1087
00:51:14.420 --> 00:51:16.340
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your legs get super fatigued.</v>

1088
00:51:16.341 --> 00:51:19.070
<v Speaker 3>But that's like what I like to do for</v>
<v Speaker 3>legs.</v>

1089
00:51:19.071 --> 00:51:22.940
<v Speaker 3>I start off with Kettlebell swings just</v>
<v Speaker 3>to sort of get everything loosened up.</v>

1090
00:51:23.330 --> 00:51:26.270
<v Speaker 3>I do it light for a couple sets than I</v>
<v Speaker 3>do heavy ones.</v>

1091
00:51:26.420 --> 00:51:30.440
<v Speaker 3>And then from there everything's all</v>
<v Speaker 3>warmed up and loosened up.</v>

1092
00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:33.740
<v Speaker 3>Then I get into those Hindu squats and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>just do because I feel like that's</v>

1093
00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:39.040
<v Speaker 3>something that's always hard to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I went hiking in Nevada with a</v>

1094
00:51:40.191 --> 00:51:42.350
<v Speaker 3>couple friends of mine that were very</v>
<v Speaker 3>fit.</v>

1095
00:51:42.351 --> 00:51:45.710
<v Speaker 3>My friend Dan Dodi who was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were doing a TV show up there and</v>

1096
00:51:45.711 --> 00:51:48.680
<v Speaker 3>he's the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was the camera man and he was much</v>

1097
00:51:48.681 --> 00:51:52.610
<v Speaker 3>better than me at doing these things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was realizing when I was doing</v>

1098
00:51:52.620 --> 00:51:53.570
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God damn it,</v>

1099
00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:56.510
<v Speaker 3>this is a very specific thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you do it all the time,</v>

1100
00:51:56.810 --> 00:52:00.620
<v Speaker 3>if you like a camera cameraman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially have the get in some really</v>

1101
00:52:00.621 --> 00:52:03.890
<v Speaker 3>incredible shape and they do these</v>
<v Speaker 3>outdoor shows because they're constantly</v>

1102
00:52:03.891 --> 00:52:06.350
<v Speaker 3>carrying this camera and walking around.</v>

1103
00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:09.680
<v Speaker 3>So like if you were doing a show on</v>
<v Speaker 3>hiking and you had a guy following you,</v>

1104
00:52:09.681 --> 00:52:13.790
<v Speaker 3>this guy has to follow you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of a sudden he's carrying a big ass</v>

1105
00:52:13.791 --> 00:52:14.624
<v Speaker 3>fucking camera</v>

1106
00:52:15.180 --> 00:52:19.470
<v Speaker 4>as he's sitting there shooting what's</v>
<v Speaker 4>supposed to be you doing some impressive</v>

1107
00:52:19.471 --> 00:52:21.360
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

1108
00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:25.090
<v Speaker 4>He's the real athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

1109
00:52:25.170 --> 00:52:26.070
<v Speaker 4>just the ability to</v>

1110
00:52:26.190 --> 00:52:29.280
<v Speaker 3>pick your body up and down for long</v>
<v Speaker 3>periods of time.</v>

1111
00:52:29.281 --> 00:52:30.210
<v Speaker 3>Just hiking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1112
00:52:30.211 --> 00:52:34.290
<v Speaker 3>like you could lift weights and you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>do a lot of stuff that you feel like,</v>

1113
00:52:34.310 --> 00:52:35.280
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in pretty good shape,</v>

1114
00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:39.750
<v Speaker 3>but it's the monotonous grind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have hours and hours of going up hills.</v>

1115
00:52:39.751 --> 00:52:40.501
<v Speaker 3>You Go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

1116
00:52:40.501 --> 00:52:41.490
<v Speaker 3>this is something different.</v>

1117
00:52:41.580 --> 00:52:43.920
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it also with hiking it,</v>

1118
00:52:44.090 --> 00:52:45.600
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your foot goes in all these</v>

1119
00:52:45.601 --> 00:52:49.520
<v Speaker 4>unpredictable angles and that that is</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's helping the most.</v>

1120
00:52:49.590 --> 00:52:52.170
<v Speaker 4>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do stretches and stuff like that,</v>

1121
00:52:52.171 --> 00:52:55.830
<v Speaker 4>but I feel like the stretches,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not mixing it up and was like,</v>

1122
00:52:55.831 --> 00:52:59.100
<v Speaker 4>I do a yoga has been helping when I got</v>
<v Speaker 4>back into rock climbing,</v>

1123
00:52:59.101 --> 00:53:01.380
<v Speaker 4>my gym had a yoga class so I was able to</v>
<v Speaker 4>do that.</v>

1124
00:53:01.410 --> 00:53:04.470
<v Speaker 4>I can't balance on one foot a little</v>
<v Speaker 4>bit.</v>

1125
00:53:04.471 --> 00:53:07.730
<v Speaker 4>Not very well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does it get shaky or like my,</v>

1126
00:53:07.790 --> 00:53:11.160
<v Speaker 4>my also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean fortunately it was my dominant</v>

1127
00:53:11.161 --> 00:53:14.370
<v Speaker 4>leg that got hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I think it will keep on recovering</v>

1128
00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:17.100
<v Speaker 4>well because there was a little more</v>
<v Speaker 4>strength to start with,</v>

1129
00:53:17.370 --> 00:53:20.010
<v Speaker 4>but my calf is pretty atrophied and</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything,</v>

1130
00:53:20.011 --> 00:53:22.830
<v Speaker 4>so it's just also have to get a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 4>strength back.</v>

1131
00:53:22.831 --> 00:53:25.650
<v Speaker 4>Which was um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've also of been,</v>

1132
00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:29.580
<v Speaker 4>when I fill out a exercising,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been a little lazy about it too.</v>

1133
00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:31.860
<v Speaker 4>Isn't that interesting how easy that is</v>
<v Speaker 4>to do,</v>

1134
00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:34.470
<v Speaker 4>like even for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I've been exercising my whole life,</v>

1135
00:53:34.471 --> 00:53:38.130
<v Speaker 4>but if I take a few days off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know I have to get back to it.</v>

1136
00:53:38.580 --> 00:53:40.980
<v Speaker 4>But part of me is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>come on man,</v>

1137
00:53:40.981 --> 00:53:44.610
<v Speaker 4>fuck this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never been an exercise guy,</v>

1138
00:53:44.611 --> 00:53:49.050
<v Speaker 4>but I was probably working out like</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing something about three hours a day,</v>

1139
00:53:49.051 --> 00:53:54.051
<v Speaker 4>like rock climbing or swimming,</v>
<v Speaker 4>jogging or crossfit or doing some boxing</v>

1140
00:53:55.141 --> 00:53:56.100
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1141
00:53:56.101 --> 00:53:59.190
<v Speaker 4>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was just like on a kick because I also</v>

1142
00:53:59.191 --> 00:54:00.720
<v Speaker 4>had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had quit drinking,</v>

1143
00:54:00.721 --> 00:54:02.910
<v Speaker 4>which I drank again now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

1144
00:54:02.911 --> 00:54:05.760
<v Speaker 4>I quit drinking and smoking cigarettes</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so I was,</v>

1145
00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:07.560
<v Speaker 4>he smoke cigarettes now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1146
00:54:07.561 --> 00:54:11.280
<v Speaker 4>I'm vaping now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I started after I started drinking</v>

1147
00:54:11.281 --> 00:54:14.880
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cigarettes followed shortly after and</v>

1148
00:54:14.881 --> 00:54:17.310
<v Speaker 4>then I saw I've been smoking cigarettes</v>
<v Speaker 4>for about a year,</v>

1149
00:54:17.311 --> 00:54:19.440
<v Speaker 4>which I fucking can't stand cigarettes.</v>

1150
00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:23.550
<v Speaker 4>And so I've been vaping and I'm hoping</v>
<v Speaker 4>in like three months I'll be able to go</v>

1151
00:54:23.551 --> 00:54:28.551
<v Speaker 4>from vaping to chew.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I want to do the dip.</v>

1152
00:54:28.750 --> 00:54:31.380
<v Speaker 4>I tried dip recently.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It gives you a quite a buzz.</v>

1153
00:54:31.381 --> 00:54:33.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's interesting stuff actually</v>

1154
00:54:33.300 --> 00:54:35.340
<v Speaker 4>accidentally swallowed it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1155
00:54:35.430 --> 00:54:38.310
<v Speaker 4>but here's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the most interesting things that</v>

1156
00:54:38.311 --> 00:54:41.970
<v Speaker 4>I learned from the injury was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was how,</v>

1157
00:54:42.330 --> 00:54:47.330
<v Speaker 4>how your physical health or wellbeing</v>
<v Speaker 4>alters your perception of the world.</v>

1158
00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:51.330
<v Speaker 4>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1159
00:54:51.420 --> 00:54:52.820
<v Speaker 4>have you ever heard of the study?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

1160
00:54:52.870 --> 00:54:55.230
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they do like the hot and Cold Cup study</v>

1161
00:54:55.231 --> 00:54:57.990
<v Speaker 4>where they have someone come in to fill</v>
<v Speaker 4>out a survey,</v>

1162
00:54:58.010 --> 00:54:59.910
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what they tell them and then a</v>

1163
00:54:59.911 --> 00:55:03.560
<v Speaker 4>person gets in an elevator and they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1164
00:55:03.570 --> 00:55:04.403
<v Speaker 4>and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1165
00:55:04.410 --> 00:55:06.720
<v Speaker 4>there's someone in there like</v>
<v Speaker 4>confederate,</v>

1166
00:55:06.721 --> 00:55:09.390
<v Speaker 4>an actor is in there that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here I,</v>

1167
00:55:09.420 --> 00:55:11.550
<v Speaker 4>my hands are full,</v>
<v Speaker 4>could you hold this cup for me?</v>

1168
00:55:11.580 --> 00:55:14.010
<v Speaker 4>And it's either like a hot cup of coffee</v>
<v Speaker 4>or whatever,</v>

1169
00:55:14.011 --> 00:55:17.190
<v Speaker 4>or cold drink and the person says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sure takes the drink,</v>

1170
00:55:17.580 --> 00:55:19.500
<v Speaker 4>goes up the elevator,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gets off,</v>

1171
00:55:19.930 --> 00:55:21.750
<v Speaker 4>gives it back to them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1172
00:55:22.020 --> 00:55:25.020
<v Speaker 4>says Bob goes in and takes the survey</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then afterwards,</v>

1173
00:55:25.290 --> 00:55:27.930
<v Speaker 4>and this is what it's actually about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Afterwards they go,</v>

1174
00:55:27.931 --> 00:55:32.220
<v Speaker 4>did you meet anyone in the way in?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I actually,</v>

1175
00:55:32.221 --> 00:55:34.620
<v Speaker 4>someone I met someone in the elevator</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then they'll,</v>

1176
00:55:34.710 --> 00:55:35.640
<v Speaker 4>they'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

1177
00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:37.350
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can you,</v>

1178
00:55:37.410 --> 00:55:39.660
<v Speaker 4>can you describe that person?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if they had,</v>

1179
00:55:39.990 --> 00:55:41.730
<v Speaker 4>if they had the hot drink,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll,</v>

1180
00:55:42.210 --> 00:55:44.040
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were more,</v>

1181
00:55:44.100 --> 00:55:46.620
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would more often describe them as</v>

1182
00:55:46.621 --> 00:55:49.710
<v Speaker 4>being like warm or friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if they had the cold drink,</v>

1183
00:55:49.711 --> 00:55:52.530
<v Speaker 4>they would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would describe them as like cold or</v>

1184
00:55:52.531 --> 00:55:54.300
<v Speaker 4>distant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1185
00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:55.950
<v Speaker 4>and the idea is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that,</v>

1186
00:55:56.280 --> 00:55:57.180
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1187
00:55:57.510 --> 00:56:02.100
<v Speaker 4>that the way our,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our brains evolved kind of these,</v>

1188
00:56:02.310 --> 00:56:05.910
<v Speaker 4>these higher ideas of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of what like being distant as a</v>

1189
00:56:05.911 --> 00:56:10.710
<v Speaker 4>personality trait or whatever means he</v>
<v Speaker 4>has to be built over this preexisting</v>

1190
00:56:10.711 --> 00:56:14.640
<v Speaker 4>kind of a five senses kind of software.</v>

1191
00:56:14.910 --> 00:56:17.040
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so,</v>

1192
00:56:17.130 --> 00:56:21.030
<v Speaker 4>so there's all these metaphors for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you call someone like bright or you</v>

1193
00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:23.980
<v Speaker 4>say we're having a deep conversation or</v>
<v Speaker 4>shallow.</v>

1194
00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:27.910
<v Speaker 4>So a lot of these ways in which we</v>
<v Speaker 4>describe life is,</v>

1195
00:56:28.270 --> 00:56:32.290
<v Speaker 4>is kind of used through these physical</v>
<v Speaker 4>metaphors.</v>

1196
00:56:32.530 --> 00:56:35.080
<v Speaker 4>And I remember when I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I broke my feet,</v>

1197
00:56:35.710 --> 00:56:40.300
<v Speaker 4>I remember thinking the whole fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>world is broken.</v>

1198
00:56:40.540 --> 00:56:44.710
<v Speaker 4>Like I remember thinking like eyes on</v>
<v Speaker 4>eyes going down this mountain for like</v>

1199
00:56:44.711 --> 00:56:46.360
<v Speaker 4>three,</v>
<v Speaker 4>three hours.</v>

1200
00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:50.680
<v Speaker 4>And I wasn't just worried about my feet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I also like in the fucking political</v>

1201
00:56:50.681 --> 00:56:54.820
<v Speaker 4>system is like everything just seemed</v>
<v Speaker 4>broken like the whole world.</v>

1202
00:56:55.150 --> 00:56:59.320
<v Speaker 4>And then I also remember after I got the</v>
<v Speaker 4>second surgery,</v>

1203
00:56:59.321 --> 00:57:01.900
<v Speaker 4>after the bone infection and stuff and</v>
<v Speaker 4>having to change all this,</v>

1204
00:57:01.901 --> 00:57:06.901
<v Speaker 4>I remember feeling like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like something like this nagging feeling</v>

1205
00:57:08.711 --> 00:57:12.730
<v Speaker 4>that I couldn't get over as like some</v>
<v Speaker 4>things like missing from my life.</v>

1206
00:57:12.790 --> 00:57:17.710
<v Speaker 4>There's just this deep like hole</v>
<v Speaker 4>somewhere in my soul in my feet.</v>

1207
00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:19.480
<v Speaker 4>And then one day I realized I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1208
00:57:19.481 --> 00:57:23.680
<v Speaker 4>there's a fucking hole in my foot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's an actual hole in my foot.</v>

1209
00:57:23.710 --> 00:57:25.620
<v Speaker 4>That's what's missing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1210
00:57:25.740 --> 00:57:28.360
<v Speaker 4>and just how much that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that your,</v>

1211
00:57:28.590 --> 00:57:33.430
<v Speaker 4>your physical senses can alter what your</v>
<v Speaker 4>perception of the world is for sure.</v>

1212
00:57:33.460 --> 00:57:36.100
<v Speaker 4>How you feel physically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1213
00:57:36.590 --> 00:57:38.930
<v Speaker 6>Changes how you interact with other</v>
<v Speaker 6>people.</v>

1214
00:57:38.931 --> 00:57:41.440
<v Speaker 6>It changes how people perceive you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Attend changes,</v>

1215
00:57:41.450 --> 00:57:44.960
<v Speaker 6>the kind of conversations you have</v>
<v Speaker 6>because maybe you'll have more</v>

1216
00:57:44.961 --> 00:57:49.940
<v Speaker 6>enthusiasm or energy or friendliness or</v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever it is that when you engage</v>

1217
00:57:49.941 --> 00:57:50.360
<v Speaker 6>with.</v>

1218
00:57:50.360 --> 00:57:52.120
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then you can have two broken feet and</v>

1219
00:57:52.121 --> 00:57:53.530
<v Speaker 4>they can give you morphine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You going to be like,</v>

1220
00:57:53.620 --> 00:57:55.180
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>life's fine.</v>

1221
00:57:55.200 --> 00:57:59.110
<v Speaker 4>That it's going to be great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you go from morphine to this</v>

1222
00:57:59.111 --> 00:58:00.400
<v Speaker 4>Kratom stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1223
00:58:00.401 --> 00:58:02.830
<v Speaker 4>this kratom stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just discovered like three weeks ago,</v>

1224
00:58:02.831 --> 00:58:05.560
<v Speaker 4>I haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I haven't taken painkillers in like a,</v>

1225
00:58:05.910 --> 00:58:08.290
<v Speaker 4>and this isn't a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

1226
00:58:08.291 --> 00:58:11.320
<v Speaker 4>I think the research is out on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying people should do Kratom.</v>

1227
00:58:11.380 --> 00:58:13.140
<v Speaker 4>It's working for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1228
00:58:13.150 --> 00:58:16.090
<v Speaker 4>do you ever try a cannabis edible?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cannabis?</v>

1229
00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:17.530
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like edibles.</v>

1230
00:58:17.531 --> 00:58:20.350
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a big weed smoker.</v>

1231
00:58:20.351 --> 00:58:23.350
<v Speaker 4>I probably smoke like twice a week maybe</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the most.</v>

1232
00:58:23.430 --> 00:58:25.060
<v Speaker 4>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Only in California.</v>

1233
00:58:25.061 --> 00:58:27.280
<v Speaker 4>Can you say that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>A big weed smoker.</v>

1234
00:58:27.281 --> 00:58:29.680
<v Speaker 4>I take days off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have like,</v>

1235
00:58:29.681 --> 00:58:30.520
<v Speaker 4>I've probably,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1236
00:58:30.521 --> 00:58:33.700
<v Speaker 4>probably once or twice a week.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have like a hit of weed,</v>

1237
00:58:34.170 --> 00:58:38.470
<v Speaker 4>but I'm out of bolts help a bit and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the CBDS,</v>

1238
00:58:38.740 --> 00:58:41.830
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if I can't tell if the CBDS</v>
<v Speaker 4>are helping or not.</v>

1239
00:58:42.010 --> 00:58:44.170
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it seems like they do a little bit,</v>

1240
00:58:44.470 --> 00:58:46.570
<v Speaker 4>but I'm still experimenting with some of</v>
<v Speaker 4>that stuff.</v>

1241
00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:48.370
<v Speaker 4>The kratom I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was just in,</v>

1242
00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:50.980
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was in Wilmington,</v>

1243
00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:52.720
<v Speaker 4>North Carolina,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1244
00:58:52.870 --> 00:58:55.930
<v Speaker 4>doing this dead crow club and I had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>

1245
00:58:56.200 --> 00:59:01.180
<v Speaker 4>when I'm doing lots of standup and on my</v>
<v Speaker 4>feet in one place is when it seems to</v>

1246
00:59:01.240 --> 00:59:06.130
<v Speaker 4>have a lot of trouble and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I was just like bitching about it</v>

1247
00:59:06.131 --> 00:59:08.410
<v Speaker 4>because I was just having,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was one of those three days where I</v>

1248
00:59:08.411 --> 00:59:11.080
<v Speaker 4>was just having a rough few days with it</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they're like,</v>

1249
00:59:11.081 --> 00:59:12.730
<v Speaker 4>you should go to the Kratom bar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1250
00:59:12.731 --> 00:59:16.390
<v Speaker 4>what's that freedom bar?</v>
<v Speaker 4>These bars that they have,</v>

1251
00:59:16.391 --> 00:59:20.500
<v Speaker 4>like Kava and Kratom and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I went pretty skeptical,</v>

1252
00:59:20.501 --> 00:59:22.370
<v Speaker 4>especially when something's legal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1253
00:59:22.790 --> 00:59:24.200
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not going to do anything.</v>

1254
00:59:24.590 --> 00:59:27.030
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>

1255
00:59:27.031 --> 00:59:29.930
<v Speaker 4>I had some.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And right away it was a,</v>

1256
00:59:30.670 --> 00:59:32.050
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

1257
00:59:32.560 --> 00:59:34.370
<v Speaker 4>like within an hour I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1258
00:59:34.371 --> 00:59:37.940
<v Speaker 4>my foot feels perfect right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I walked just like a normal person</v>

1259
00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:40.730
<v Speaker 4>when I'm on the stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a little skeptical,</v>

1260
00:59:40.731 --> 00:59:42.910
<v Speaker 4>I imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I imagine there's some addictive.</v>

1261
00:59:42.950 --> 00:59:43.710
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1262
00:59:43.710 --> 00:59:47.060
<v Speaker 4>I had a scientist sent me a paper about</v>
<v Speaker 4>it and I guess there are some side</v>

1263
00:59:47.061 --> 00:59:48.380
<v Speaker 4>effects.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I haven't read them all yet,</v>

1264
00:59:48.381 --> 00:59:51.500
<v Speaker 4>but it's just not near what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like any other pain killer,</v>

1265
00:59:51.740 --> 00:59:54.680
<v Speaker 3>why are they making it a schedule one?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there a real issue that people could</v>

1266
00:59:54.681 --> 00:59:57.620
<v Speaker 3>die from it or what's the ld 50 with</v>
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>

1267
00:59:57.621 --> 01:00:01.130
<v Speaker 3>which is if people don't know lethal</v>
<v Speaker 3>dose at 50 percent,</v>

1268
01:00:01.131 --> 01:00:04.610
<v Speaker 3>meaning that if you give 100 rats a</v>
<v Speaker 3>certain amount,</v>

1269
01:00:04.611 --> 01:00:07.460
<v Speaker 3>50 percent of them are going to die at a</v>
<v Speaker 3>certain.</v>

1270
01:00:07.550 --> 01:00:09.410
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have no idea.</v>

1271
01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:10.330
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1272
01:00:10.470 --> 01:00:12.880
<v Speaker 4>I haven't done enough research into it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1273
01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:15.230
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I imagine it's not that well</v>

1274
01:00:15.231 --> 01:00:17.450
<v Speaker 4>studied,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I understand why,</v>

1275
01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:20.120
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the FDA or whatever,</v>

1276
01:00:20.121 --> 01:00:22.730
<v Speaker 4>can't just have companies making,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1277
01:00:22.731 --> 01:00:24.500
<v Speaker 4>who knows what they're putting in a</v>
<v Speaker 4>bottle.</v>

1278
01:00:24.530 --> 01:00:25.610
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get that.</v>

1279
01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:27.080
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

1280
01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:31.580
<v Speaker 4>but I mean if you look at what people</v>
<v Speaker 4>are saying about Kratom people that</v>

1281
01:00:31.970 --> 01:00:36.830
<v Speaker 4>people that are trying to manage their</v>
<v Speaker 4>pain and nothing else works or</v>

1282
01:00:36.831 --> 01:00:39.710
<v Speaker 4>everything else is really addictive or</v>
<v Speaker 4>makes the movie or whatever.</v>

1283
01:00:40.300 --> 01:00:43.130
<v Speaker 4>This stuff is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like very energetic,</v>

1284
01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:48.220
<v Speaker 4>energetic and enthusiastic and just</v>
<v Speaker 4>sharper than normal when I do it helped</v>

1285
01:00:48.681 --> 01:00:50.910
<v Speaker 4>people get off of opiates.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1286
01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:53.630
<v Speaker 4>because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a partial opiate.</v>

1287
01:00:54.050 --> 01:00:55.710
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1288
01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:59.210
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know exactly what that means.</v>

1289
01:00:59.211 --> 01:01:01.250
<v Speaker 4>Stuff all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How come you not like reading things on</v>

1290
01:01:01.251 --> 01:01:02.280
<v Speaker 4>it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm</v>

1291
01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.270
<v Speaker 4>a smart guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1292
01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:08.240
<v Speaker 4>probably taken it like 15 times now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>

1293
01:01:08.330 --> 01:01:09.380
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something like that.</v>

1294
01:01:09.381 --> 01:01:10.214
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1295
01:01:10.220 --> 01:01:12.760
<v Speaker 4>and twice in front of me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1296
01:01:13.290 --> 01:01:18.290
<v Speaker 4>Well I call that once.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That will count that as one eye.</v>

1297
01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:22.160
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be illegal next month.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'm like,</v>

1298
01:01:22.190 --> 01:01:24.530
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to try this stuff and see how</v>
<v Speaker 4>it feels.</v>

1299
01:01:24.970 --> 01:01:27.670
<v Speaker 3>What's the justification?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there any justification for the,</v>

1300
01:01:27.671 --> 01:01:30.610
<v Speaker 3>a scheduled one classification.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it something that people need to</v>

1301
01:01:30.611 --> 01:01:31.440
<v Speaker 3>worry about?</v>

1302
01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:33.660
<v Speaker 4>I mean if you look at how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how the uh,</v>

1303
01:01:33.661 --> 01:01:37.520
<v Speaker 4>the Da just just didn't reschedule</v>
<v Speaker 4>marrow,</v>

1304
01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:39.420
<v Speaker 4>which has.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Think about it.</v>

1305
01:01:39.421 --> 01:01:42.030
<v Speaker 4>If you're them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you reschedule marijuana,</v>

1306
01:01:42.031 --> 01:01:44.430
<v Speaker 4>it's basically like you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

1307
01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:47.610
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>should we just get rid of our own jobs?</v>

1308
01:01:47.820 --> 01:01:48.653
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>should,</v>

1309
01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:52.830
<v Speaker 4>should we just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>should we just make a law that gets rid</v>

1310
01:01:52.831 --> 01:01:55.170
<v Speaker 4>of our jobs and that's a way of looking</v>
<v Speaker 4>at it.</v>

1311
01:01:55.190 --> 01:01:58.430
<v Speaker 3>That's a cynical way of looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The people who aren't aware of the</v>

1312
01:01:58.550 --> 01:02:02.000
<v Speaker 3>reality of all the facts and statistics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they will look at you and go,</v>

1313
01:02:02.001 --> 01:02:03.500
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's ridiculous hippie bullshit.</v>

1314
01:02:03.501 --> 01:02:04.220
<v Speaker 3>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nope.</v>

1315
01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:05.340
<v Speaker 3>It's not know that that</v>

1316
01:02:05.690 --> 01:02:07.700
<v Speaker 4>is going on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the was no way out.</v>

1317
01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:09.710
<v Speaker 4>There's no other way around it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1318
01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:11.150
<v Speaker 4>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1319
01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:12.690
<v Speaker 4>the maps,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1320
01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:16.100
<v Speaker 4>organization which is actually</v>
<v Speaker 4>sponsoring my tour that I'm doing,</v>

1321
01:02:16.430 --> 01:02:19.320
<v Speaker 4>they have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I've had them on maps,</v>

1322
01:02:19.321 --> 01:02:22.230
<v Speaker 4>the Multidisciplinary Association of</v>
<v Speaker 4>Psychedelic Studies.</v>

1323
01:02:22.650 --> 01:02:23.890
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and they're,</v>

1324
01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:28.200
<v Speaker 7>they're the ones doing the MTMA trials</v>
<v Speaker 7>and stuff for ptsd and whatnot.</v>

1325
01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:32.010
<v Speaker 7>And they say they actually like working</v>
<v Speaker 7>with the FDA.</v>

1326
01:02:32.420 --> 01:02:36.840
<v Speaker 7>The FDA is not the problem at all.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's the diy.</v>

1327
01:02:36.940 --> 01:02:38.640
<v Speaker 7>A bunch of cops.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1328
01:02:38.641 --> 01:02:39.110
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1329
01:02:39.110 --> 01:02:40.070
<v Speaker 6>Bunch of.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Listen,</v>

1330
01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:43.520
<v Speaker 6>one of the big issues with medical</v>
<v Speaker 6>marijuana or legalizing marijuana is</v>

1331
01:02:43.521 --> 01:02:45.710
<v Speaker 6>prison guard unions,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is kind of hilarious.</v>

1332
01:02:45.930 --> 01:02:48.200
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like they are literally trying to</v>

1333
01:02:48.230 --> 01:02:51.110
<v Speaker 6>keep things illegal so they keep their</v>
<v Speaker 6>jobs.</v>

1334
01:02:51.111 --> 01:02:52.510
<v Speaker 6>So they have more hours.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Exactly.</v>

1335
01:02:52.610 --> 01:02:53.870
<v Speaker 6>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's again,</v>

1336
01:02:53.871 --> 01:02:55.310
<v Speaker 6>one of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It shouldn't be legal,</v>

1337
01:02:55.340 --> 01:02:57.050
<v Speaker 6>just like advertising drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's one of those.</v>

1338
01:02:57.130 --> 01:02:59.770
<v Speaker 7>Well one was when Nixon scheduled it in</v>
<v Speaker 7>the first place,</v>

1339
01:02:59.771 --> 01:03:04.771
<v Speaker 7>he hired a team of scientists and all of</v>
<v Speaker 7>these different different politicians</v>

1340
01:03:05.021 --> 01:03:08.680
<v Speaker 7>and different,</v>
<v Speaker 7>different experts in different fields to</v>

1341
01:03:09.430 --> 01:03:14.110
<v Speaker 7>advise him and then they advised him to</v>
<v Speaker 7>not schedule it,</v>

1342
01:03:14.260 --> 01:03:17.230
<v Speaker 7>to have it be legal and focus on</v>
<v Speaker 7>treatment for things.</v>

1343
01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:18.670
<v Speaker 7>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>nope,</v>

1344
01:03:18.671 --> 01:03:20.860
<v Speaker 7>we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We've got to get rid of these hippies.</v>

1345
01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:22.800
<v Speaker 6>Well that's what it did.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It really.</v>

1346
01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:24.930
<v Speaker 6>And this was something that came out</v>
<v Speaker 6>over the last year,</v>

1347
01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:26.940
<v Speaker 6>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was a freedom of information act or</v>

1348
01:03:26.941 --> 01:03:28.800
<v Speaker 6>whatever it was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they released some papers that</v>

1349
01:03:28.801 --> 01:03:33.420
<v Speaker 6>showed that what the drug war was truly</v>
<v Speaker 6>all about was the civil rights movement</v>

1350
01:03:33.510 --> 01:03:35.520
<v Speaker 6>in the hippies,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the antiwar movement and the civil</v>

1351
01:03:35.521 --> 01:03:39.780
<v Speaker 6>rights movement and that they were</v>
<v Speaker 6>trying to attack the leaders of the</v>

1352
01:03:39.781 --> 01:03:42.600
<v Speaker 6>civil rights movement and the leaders of</v>
<v Speaker 6>the antiwar movement.</v>

1353
01:03:42.601 --> 01:03:46.530
<v Speaker 6>And one thing they all had in common was</v>
<v Speaker 6>marijuana and LSD.</v>

1354
01:03:47.610 --> 01:03:48.690
<v Speaker 6>Mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure too because.</v>

1355
01:03:48.710 --> 01:03:52.710
<v Speaker 6>So that's when the sweeping psychedelics</v>
<v Speaker 6>act of 1970 was passed.</v>

1356
01:03:52.711 --> 01:03:56.910
<v Speaker 6>It was all passed under the guise of</v>
<v Speaker 6>attacking the political forces that were</v>

1357
01:03:56.911 --> 01:04:00.570
<v Speaker 6>trying to take Nixon out of office.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Nixon was such a piece of shit.</v>

1358
01:04:00.990 --> 01:04:02.340
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>such a horrible,</v>

1359
01:04:02.341 --> 01:04:04.590
<v Speaker 6>horrible piece of shit when you're</v>
<v Speaker 6>really.</v>

1360
01:04:04.650 --> 01:04:09.090
<v Speaker 6>When you go back and see what that guy</v>
<v Speaker 6>did and who he was and what he stood</v>

1361
01:04:09.091 --> 01:04:09.790
<v Speaker 6>for.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's</v>

1362
01:04:09.790 --> 01:04:12.020
<v Speaker 7>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 7>When you're like getting impeached,</v>

1363
01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:14.530
<v Speaker 7>I have to resign.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Wouldn't you like go back and look at</v>

1364
01:04:14.531 --> 01:04:16.780
<v Speaker 7>the things that he did and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know what?</v>

1365
01:04:16.810 --> 01:04:21.040
<v Speaker 7>Maybe we do a Redo on that whole</v>
<v Speaker 7>presidency and whatever he did,</v>

1366
01:04:21.041 --> 01:04:21.900
<v Speaker 7>just that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We,</v>

1367
01:04:21.970 --> 01:04:24.310
<v Speaker 7>we reexamined that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1368
01:04:24.311 --> 01:04:25.240
<v Speaker 7>All the different things</v>

1369
01:04:25.330 --> 01:04:26.270
<v Speaker 6>was involved in.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1370
01:04:26.271 --> 01:04:27.920
<v Speaker 6>They should have gone over every one of</v>
<v Speaker 6>his.</v>

1371
01:04:28.220 --> 01:04:29.990
<v Speaker 6>Everything that he passed with a fine</v>
<v Speaker 6>tooth comb,</v>

1372
01:04:29.991 --> 01:04:32.510
<v Speaker 6>but you got a crooked office.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not a crook.</v>

1373
01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:35.330
<v Speaker 6>He was a real cook.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Will scary guy.</v>

1374
01:04:36.070 --> 01:04:36.903
<v Speaker 7>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

1375
01:04:36.910 --> 01:04:41.570
<v Speaker 7>I might take on,</v>
<v Speaker 7>on why all of that happened was because</v>

1376
01:04:41.571 --> 01:04:44.360
<v Speaker 7>of psychedelics.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Psychedelics have this testable effect</v>

1377
01:04:44.361 --> 01:04:45.190
<v Speaker 7>on,</v>
<v Speaker 7>on,</v>

1378
01:04:45.190 --> 01:04:46.023
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

1379
01:04:46.220 --> 01:04:49.880
<v Speaker 7>a person's openness.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So if I'm like,</v>

1380
01:04:49.881 --> 01:04:54.020
<v Speaker 7>there's big five personality indicator</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's not perfect by any means,</v>

1381
01:04:54.410 --> 01:04:55.750
<v Speaker 7>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's,</v>

1382
01:04:55.790 --> 01:04:59.720
<v Speaker 7>it's used quite a bit in psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So you have conscientiousness,</v>

1383
01:04:59.721 --> 01:05:04.450
<v Speaker 7>like I'm low in conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm a very disorganized person and I'm a</v>

1384
01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:07.490
<v Speaker 7>kind of messy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm a agreeableness,</v>

1385
01:05:07.491 --> 01:05:09.950
<v Speaker 7>I'm a little low in agreeableness,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like I liked to argue with people and</v>

1386
01:05:09.951 --> 01:05:12.050
<v Speaker 7>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then there is stability or sometimes</v>

1387
01:05:12.051 --> 01:05:14.900
<v Speaker 7>called neuroticism.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm in the middle there and then there's</v>

1388
01:05:14.901 --> 01:05:16.850
<v Speaker 7>extroversion also in the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then there's.</v>

1389
01:05:17.710 --> 01:05:22.150
<v Speaker 7>So if you're very high in openness,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that means like you not only are you not</v>

1390
01:05:22.151 --> 01:05:25.060
<v Speaker 7>averse to novelty or you can't get</v>
<v Speaker 7>enough of it,</v>

1391
01:05:25.061 --> 01:05:27.520
<v Speaker 7>you love new restaurants,</v>
<v Speaker 7>traveling,</v>

1392
01:05:27.521 --> 01:05:29.230
<v Speaker 7>meeting New People,</v>
<v Speaker 7>having,</v>

1393
01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:30.540
<v Speaker 7>having,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

1394
01:05:30.541 --> 01:05:32.590
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>going on adventures and,</v>

1395
01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:37.920
<v Speaker 7>and if your in the side effect is you're</v>
<v Speaker 7>the kind of person that maybe ends up</v>

1396
01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:41.170
<v Speaker 7>not having respect for authority and</v>
<v Speaker 7>ends up like getting in trouble with the</v>

1397
01:05:41.171 --> 01:05:45.250
<v Speaker 7>law or you're a little overly</v>
<v Speaker 7>spontaneous or a little too adventurous</v>

1398
01:05:45.251 --> 01:05:46.810
<v Speaker 7>and you break your feet or whatever it</v>
<v Speaker 7>might be.</v>

1399
01:05:46.990 --> 01:05:50.020
<v Speaker 7>Are you a Tarot card reader?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1400
01:05:50.021 --> 01:05:53.260
<v Speaker 7>I know it sounds a lot like Taro cards</v>
<v Speaker 7>and really some of these things</v>

1401
01:05:53.261 --> 01:05:56.140
<v Speaker 7>shouldn't be taken much more seriously</v>
<v Speaker 7>than Tarot cards,</v>

1402
01:05:56.141 --> 01:05:58.260
<v Speaker 7>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I do a nice job of you.</v>

1403
01:05:58.270 --> 01:06:00.610
<v Speaker 7>So you asked,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you asked people questions like,</v>

1404
01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:03.640
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>do you consider yourself a clean person?</v>

1405
01:06:03.641 --> 01:06:05.410
<v Speaker 7>Like strongly agree,</v>
<v Speaker 7>strongly disagree,</v>

1406
01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:08.290
<v Speaker 7>where wherever in between,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and so you're filling out questions like</v>

1407
01:06:08.291 --> 01:06:11.320
<v Speaker 7>that and that's how it's kind of</v>
<v Speaker 7>determining and it's self evaluation,</v>

1408
01:06:11.321 --> 01:06:13.300
<v Speaker 7>which there's problems there or there's</v>
<v Speaker 7>this,</v>

1409
01:06:13.330 --> 01:06:15.740
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's a website called apply apple</v>

1410
01:06:15.741 --> 01:06:18.610
<v Speaker 7>sauce.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You'd go to it in and plug it in and it</v>

1411
01:06:18.611 --> 01:06:21.880
<v Speaker 7>goes through everything you've liked on</v>
<v Speaker 7>facebook and kind of determines your</v>

1412
01:06:21.940 --> 01:06:26.710
<v Speaker 7>personal traits based on that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So if you're really low on openness,</v>

1413
01:06:26.740 --> 01:06:29.450
<v Speaker 7>you're like the kind of person that's</v>
<v Speaker 7>always been in their hometown,</v>

1414
01:06:29.470 --> 01:06:31.330
<v Speaker 7>kind of why go anywhere else?</v>

1415
01:06:31.330 --> 01:06:34.030
<v Speaker 7>This is great to traveling and scary to</v>
<v Speaker 7>you.</v>

1416
01:06:34.060 --> 01:06:36.010
<v Speaker 7>Your country is the best.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You haven't been to other countries,</v>

1417
01:06:36.011 --> 01:06:39.330
<v Speaker 7>but you know that your country is the</v>
<v Speaker 7>best and you're whatever church you're</v>

1418
01:06:39.370 --> 01:06:41.140
<v Speaker 7>brought up in is absolutely the right</v>
<v Speaker 7>one.</v>

1419
01:06:41.150 --> 01:06:42.700
<v Speaker 7>The other one's kind of sound</v>
<v Speaker 7>ridiculous.</v>

1420
01:06:42.701 --> 01:06:45.910
<v Speaker 7>And,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and outsiders are very scary and one</v>

1421
01:06:45.911 --> 01:06:46.840
<v Speaker 7>thing that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

1422
01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:51.550
<v Speaker 7>that psychedelics have been pretty well</v>
<v Speaker 7>studied to do now is that a single dose</v>

1423
01:06:51.551 --> 01:06:53.770
<v Speaker 7>of psychedelics will for a good amount</v>
<v Speaker 7>of time,</v>

1424
01:06:54.090 --> 01:06:56.710
<v Speaker 7>it often a year sometimes for the rest</v>
<v Speaker 7>of your life,</v>

1425
01:06:56.980 --> 01:07:00.490
<v Speaker 7>you'll be more open,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you'll rate higher in openness for the</v>

1426
01:07:00.491 --> 01:07:03.430
<v Speaker 7>rest of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So people were doing more psychedelics</v>

1427
01:07:03.431 --> 01:07:08.431
<v Speaker 7>at this time and they were in.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So if you're low country or if you're</v>

1428
01:07:08.681 --> 01:07:10.320
<v Speaker 7>low in openness,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're like,</v>

1429
01:07:10.630 --> 01:07:13.630
<v Speaker 7>you're often a pillar of the community</v>
<v Speaker 7>because you love laws.</v>

1430
01:07:13.820 --> 01:07:16.300
<v Speaker 7>Laws are your favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You have this nice little playbook that</v>

1431
01:07:16.301 --> 01:07:20.020
<v Speaker 7>you can live life by and you wish there</v>
<v Speaker 7>were stricter so more people would</v>

1432
01:07:20.021 --> 01:07:21.940
<v Speaker 7>follow them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So if you're a law maker,</v>

1433
01:07:21.941 --> 01:07:25.000
<v Speaker 7>these are your favorite people.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then if these people were,</v>

1434
01:07:25.030 --> 01:07:26.710
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>young and in college and like,</v>

1435
01:07:26.711 --> 01:07:27.431
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what the heck,</v>

1436
01:07:27.431 --> 01:07:30.370
<v Speaker 7>everyone else is doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then all of a sudden becoming more</v>

1437
01:07:30.371 --> 01:07:34.540
<v Speaker 7>open and starting to question authority.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think it did play a little bit of a</v>

1438
01:07:34.541 --> 01:07:36.020
<v Speaker 7>factor in,</v>
<v Speaker 7>in</v>

1439
01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:39.680
<v Speaker 3>I'm a little bit of the civil rights</v>
<v Speaker 3>movement.</v>

1440
01:07:39.740 --> 01:07:43.340
<v Speaker 3>So you think this was a conscious</v>
<v Speaker 3>decision by the powers that be to try to</v>

1441
01:07:43.341 --> 01:07:46.760
<v Speaker 3>limit psychedelics because they were</v>
<v Speaker 3>worried specifically about people</v>

1442
01:07:46.761 --> 01:07:47.840
<v Speaker 3>becoming more open?</v>

1443
01:07:47.900 --> 01:07:48.733
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think.</v>

1444
01:07:48.740 --> 01:07:51.380
<v Speaker 7>I don't think that they understood that</v>
<v Speaker 7>what was happening.</v>

1445
01:07:51.710 --> 01:07:53.720
<v Speaker 7>I think that psychedelics had this</v>
<v Speaker 7>effect.</v>

1446
01:07:53.721 --> 01:07:55.370
<v Speaker 7>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't think the government knows a</v>

1447
01:07:55.371 --> 01:07:56.350
<v Speaker 7>lot,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1448
01:07:56.351 --> 01:07:56.570
<v Speaker 7>I</v>

1449
01:07:56.570 --> 01:07:58.680
<v Speaker 3>do either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they did do those other.</v>

1450
01:07:58.710 --> 01:08:00.890
<v Speaker 3>There's quite a few,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of tests that went on with,</v>

1451
01:08:01.010 --> 01:08:03.470
<v Speaker 3>especially with Lsd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the military.</v>

1452
01:08:03.471 --> 01:08:05.300
<v Speaker 3>And then of course there was the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Harvard,</v>

1453
01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:09.920
<v Speaker 3>the very famous Harvard Lsd Studies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which there's a good argument created</v>

1454
01:08:09.921 --> 01:08:12.020
<v Speaker 3>Ted Kaczynski.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you're aware of that,</v>

1455
01:08:12.021 --> 01:08:12.980
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1456
01:08:12.981 --> 01:08:13.520
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1457
01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:16.840
<v Speaker 3>the was the German documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>believe it's called the net and it was</v>

1458
01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:21.470
<v Speaker 3>all highlighted how Ted Kaczynski the</v>
<v Speaker 3>unibomber was a part of these lsd</v>

1459
01:08:21.471 --> 01:08:25.130
<v Speaker 3>studies at Harvard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They fucking fried that dude's brain.</v>

1460
01:08:25.340 --> 01:08:27.350
<v Speaker 3>He went to Berkeley.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was probably crazy already,</v>

1461
01:08:27.530 --> 01:08:29.540
<v Speaker 3>but he went to Berkeley,</v>
<v Speaker 3>became a professor,</v>

1462
01:08:29.610 --> 01:08:33.490
<v Speaker 3>hoarded off all his money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just saved enough money to implement his</v>

1463
01:08:33.491 --> 01:08:36.920
<v Speaker 3>plan and then bought that little cabin</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the woods and started killing people</v>

1464
01:08:36.921 --> 01:08:40.100
<v Speaker 3>who were involved in technology because</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was convinced because it was lsd</v>

1465
01:08:40.101 --> 01:08:43.400
<v Speaker 3>trips that and really he's right,</v>

1466
01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:47.080
<v Speaker 4>exceptionally bright guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that that?</v>

1467
01:08:47.081 --> 01:08:49.690
<v Speaker 4>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was what was kind of peculiar and</v>

1468
01:08:49.691 --> 01:08:51.880
<v Speaker 4>very scary about him like he was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was a genius.</v>

1469
01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:53.340
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's how they found him out.</v>

1470
01:08:53.450 --> 01:08:58.450
<v Speaker 3>His brother recognized his crazy</v>
<v Speaker 3>rumbling scribe from the manifesto.</v>

1471
01:08:59.220 --> 01:09:03.240
<v Speaker 3>Brother met recognize the manifesto and</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably is thinking it might be his</v>

1472
01:09:03.241 --> 01:09:06.210
<v Speaker 3>brother anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because when his brother came back from</v>

1473
01:09:06.330 --> 01:09:09.060
<v Speaker 3>the lsd trips,</v>
<v Speaker 3>apparently he was absolutely convinced</v>

1474
01:09:09.090 --> 01:09:11.850
<v Speaker 3>that technology was going to be the end</v>
<v Speaker 3>of mankind,</v>

1475
01:09:11.851 --> 01:09:15.600
<v Speaker 3>that we had to stop it in its tracks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it was just a Trojan horse and that</v>

1476
01:09:15.601 --> 01:09:17.040
<v Speaker 3>people were creating all this</v>
<v Speaker 3>technology,</v>

1477
01:09:17.041 --> 01:09:19.020
<v Speaker 3>but he was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was extrapolating who's seeing the</v>

1478
01:09:19.021 --> 01:09:21.120
<v Speaker 3>future and seeing everything and he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1479
01:09:21.330 --> 01:09:21.901
<v Speaker 3>He's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1480
01:09:21.901 --> 01:09:25.410
<v Speaker 3>this is one of the things we're talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about today as ai becomes more and more</v>

1481
01:09:25.411 --> 01:09:26.550
<v Speaker 3>of a reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1482
01:09:26.670 --> 01:09:28.920
<v Speaker 3>even Elon Musk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that famous speech,</v>

1483
01:09:28.921 --> 01:09:33.060
<v Speaker 3>he said that we're summoning the demon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this is essentially what Ted</v>

1484
01:09:33.060 --> 01:09:35.640
<v Speaker 3>Kaczynski saw.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's just in his crazy fucking head.</v>

1485
01:09:35.641 --> 01:09:38.540
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way to fix this is to kill the algae</v>

1486
01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:42.890
<v Speaker 3>mean he's not idea poor execution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1487
01:09:42.900 --> 01:09:44.490
<v Speaker 3>not even a good idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just a,</v>

1488
01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:46.500
<v Speaker 3>an,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an odd reality.</v>

1489
01:09:46.870 --> 01:09:48.600
<v Speaker 3>The possibilities of the future.</v>

1490
01:09:50.010 --> 01:09:51.300
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so to clarify,</v>

1491
01:09:51.301 --> 01:09:55.020
<v Speaker 4>just so just so I'm not coming off like</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a conspiracy.</v>

1492
01:09:55.021 --> 01:09:56.730
<v Speaker 4>I don't think the government knew any of</v>
<v Speaker 4>this stuff.</v>

1493
01:09:56.731 --> 01:09:58.470
<v Speaker 4>I don't think anyone knew a lot of these</v>
<v Speaker 4>effects.</v>

1494
01:09:58.471 --> 01:10:00.900
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think like a lot of these cultural</v>

1495
01:10:00.901 --> 01:10:02.130
<v Speaker 4>memes are lost.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That happened.</v>

1496
01:10:02.131 --> 01:10:05.900
<v Speaker 4>It's just kind of something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something that just kind of happened at</v>

1497
01:10:05.901 --> 01:10:10.901
<v Speaker 4>an idea that was stumbled upon that just</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of ended up working in the interest</v>

1498
01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:13.490
<v Speaker 4>of the lawmakers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

1499
01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:18.640
<v Speaker 4>So I think people happened to start</v>
<v Speaker 4>taking more psychedelics because they're</v>

1500
01:10:19.580 --> 01:10:22.110
<v Speaker 4>popularized for therapy use and whatnot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

1501
01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:25.170
<v Speaker 4>So it just happened to be that people</v>
<v Speaker 4>started doing second Alex and it</v>

1502
01:10:25.171 --> 01:10:28.830
<v Speaker 4>happened to be during the civil rights</v>
<v Speaker 4>movement time and when people did take</v>

1503
01:10:28.831 --> 01:10:31.080
<v Speaker 4>psychedelics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they happen and people didn't know this</v>

1504
01:10:31.081 --> 01:10:33.390
<v Speaker 4>at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>happened to be opening themselves up and</v>

1505
01:10:33.391 --> 01:10:36.330
<v Speaker 4>questioning authority more because</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what they happened to make you</v>

1506
01:10:36.331 --> 01:10:39.540
<v Speaker 4>do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then all of a sudden there's a lot</v>

1507
01:10:39.541 --> 01:10:42.270
<v Speaker 4>more troublemakers out there for the</v>
<v Speaker 4>government.</v>

1508
01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:43.950
<v Speaker 4>And then the associate those two</v>
<v Speaker 4>together.</v>

1509
01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:46.610
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the things that I find</v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting.</v>

1510
01:10:47.090 --> 01:10:52.090
<v Speaker 3>I think it was timothy leary said this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but apparently Terence Mckenna asked</v>

1511
01:10:52.611 --> 01:10:54.650
<v Speaker 3>Timothy leary and he denied that he ever</v>
<v Speaker 3>said it.</v>

1512
01:10:54.770 --> 01:10:57.380
<v Speaker 3>So no one knows who said it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was one of those guys during that</v>

1513
01:10:57.381 --> 01:11:01.680
<v Speaker 3>time said that LSD has been known to</v>
<v Speaker 3>create a,</v>

1514
01:11:01.820 --> 01:11:03.680
<v Speaker 3>to cause people to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1515
01:11:03.890 --> 01:11:07.070
<v Speaker 3>lsd has been known to cause people who</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't take it to go crazy.</v>

1516
01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:13.040
<v Speaker 3>Like that's a fun way more elegant than</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1517
01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:13.890
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1518
01:11:13.890 --> 01:11:14.130
<v Speaker 3>that</v>

1519
01:11:14.130 --> 01:11:14.940
<v Speaker 4>was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1520
01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:17.700
<v Speaker 4>that's really the way it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I know so many people that don't</v>

1521
01:11:17.701 --> 01:11:19.980
<v Speaker 4>smoke pot and when they hear I smoked</v>
<v Speaker 4>pot all the time,</v>

1522
01:11:20.260 --> 01:11:22.500
<v Speaker 4>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's you smoke pot all the time?</v>

1523
01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:24.930
<v Speaker 4>Like how do you get things done?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like potheads are lazy.</v>

1524
01:11:24.931 --> 01:11:26.910
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're saying that you on smoke pot?</v>

1525
01:11:26.911 --> 01:11:28.260
<v Speaker 4>Like how can you say that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1526
01:11:28.261 --> 01:11:30.420
<v Speaker 4>I think it ended.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It affects everyone differently.</v>

1527
01:11:30.421 --> 01:11:35.421
<v Speaker 4>I know people that function at very high</v>
<v Speaker 4>levels and pretty much only do when</v>

1528
01:11:35.551 --> 01:11:36.540
<v Speaker 4>they're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When they're on,</v>

1529
01:11:36.541 --> 01:11:37.950
<v Speaker 4>we'd like if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they,</v>

1530
01:11:38.010 --> 01:11:40.780
<v Speaker 4>if they stopped taking pot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they become like,</v>

1531
01:11:41.630 --> 01:11:44.190
<v Speaker 4>become like dumbed down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it helps them.</v>

1532
01:11:44.250 --> 01:11:46.230
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it's a dependency or</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatnot but,</v>

1533
01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:49.350
<v Speaker 4>but some people like motivates them and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they can clean the house.</v>

1534
01:11:49.351 --> 01:11:53.010
<v Speaker 4>They can take care of shit and it</v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't have that effect on me.</v>

1535
01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:54.570
<v Speaker 4>It makes me a little paranoid.</v>

1536
01:11:54.570 --> 01:11:55.540
<v Speaker 4>It makes me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

1537
01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:58.140
<v Speaker 4>it dulls me down a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like hm.</v>

1538
01:11:58.830 --> 01:12:00.270
<v Speaker 4>But edibles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like edibles,</v>

1539
01:12:00.271 --> 01:12:03.270
<v Speaker 4>don't have that effect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll do different strains have an</v>

1540
01:12:03.271 --> 01:12:05.310
<v Speaker 4>effect on any differently or.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1541
01:12:05.311 --> 01:12:08.220
<v Speaker 4>I feel like I've tried a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 4>different strains and I can't find</v>

1542
01:12:08.221 --> 01:12:12.840
<v Speaker 4>anything that I like to at the end of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the night have a hit of weed if I'm like</v>

1543
01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:15.990
<v Speaker 4>by myself and watch a movie or something</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that,</v>

1544
01:12:15.991 --> 01:12:19.620
<v Speaker 4>or if I'm just hanging out with a friend</v>
<v Speaker 4>watching a movie in a social situation,</v>

1545
01:12:20.030 --> 01:12:22.950
<v Speaker 4>like I wouldn't want us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The reason why I wouldn't want to smoke</v>

1546
01:12:22.951 --> 01:12:26.940
<v Speaker 4>weed like before doing this podcast is</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I would worry that I would get</v>

1547
01:12:26.941 --> 01:12:31.170
<v Speaker 4>in my head too much and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and be over analyzing things.</v>

1548
01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:32.690
<v Speaker 4>Well also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

1549
01:12:33.090 --> 01:12:36.180
<v Speaker 4>when you're doing something like this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's being broadcast.</v>

1550
01:12:36.181 --> 01:12:38.580
<v Speaker 4>Like if you and I were just hanging out</v>
<v Speaker 4>together.</v>

1551
01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:41.770
<v Speaker 4>Ridiculous Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1552
01:12:42.370 --> 01:12:45.210
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the things that we've done</v>
<v Speaker 4>on this podcast a million times.</v>

1553
01:12:45.211 --> 01:12:47.370
<v Speaker 4>Just just do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>

1554
01:12:47.371 --> 01:12:49.650
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people say ridiculous Shit and say,</v>

1555
01:12:49.651 --> 01:12:50.484
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

1556
01:12:51.060 --> 01:12:52.320
<v Speaker 4>And then people realized,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1557
01:12:52.710 --> 01:12:54.330
<v Speaker 4>everybody gets retarded when they smoke</v>
<v Speaker 4>pot.</v>

1558
01:12:54.331 --> 01:12:56.630
<v Speaker 4>It's not just me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1559
01:12:56.970 --> 01:12:58.800
<v Speaker 4>But I think that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1560
01:12:59.010 --> 01:13:03.000
<v Speaker 4>there's some people like you that say</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the different strains don't affect</v>

1561
01:13:03.001 --> 01:13:05.330
<v Speaker 4>them any differently.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I don't know that they don't,</v>

1562
01:13:05.340 --> 01:13:08.280
<v Speaker 4>I just can't figure out what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what it is for me,</v>

1563
01:13:08.281 --> 01:13:12.510
<v Speaker 4>there's a real big difference,</v>
<v Speaker 4>particularly with like the cushions,</v>

1564
01:13:12.870 --> 01:13:15.570
<v Speaker 4>like any,</v>
<v Speaker 4>any like serious indicas,</v>

1565
01:13:15.790 --> 01:13:18.210
<v Speaker 4>like Degas have almost like a narcotic</v>
<v Speaker 4>effect.</v>

1566
01:13:18.211 --> 01:13:19.440
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I enjoy it,</v>

1567
01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:22.110
<v Speaker 4>I enjoy it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not what I would smoke before I</v>

1568
01:13:22.111 --> 01:13:24.630
<v Speaker 4>would go on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>see when I now I.</v>

1569
01:13:25.050 --> 01:13:27.630
<v Speaker 4>So here's the other problem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess with my,</v>

1570
01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:29.460
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way that I smoke,</v>

1571
01:13:29.470 --> 01:13:33.930
<v Speaker 4>when I first started my first got my</v>
<v Speaker 4>medical marijuana card went in to this</v>

1572
01:13:34.110 --> 01:13:34.710
<v Speaker 4>amazing.</v>

1573
01:13:34.710 --> 01:13:37.080
<v Speaker 4>The first time you walk into a</v>
<v Speaker 4>dispensary is like,</v>

1574
01:13:37.830 --> 01:13:39.960
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the future.</v>

1575
01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:42.210
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>

1576
01:13:42.300 --> 01:13:43.200
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>went crazy.</v>

1577
01:13:43.201 --> 01:13:47.370
<v Speaker 4>I spent like 700 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Give me like money is no object.</v>

1578
01:13:47.430 --> 01:13:49.800
<v Speaker 4>Got Me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want the finest of every kind of</v>

1579
01:13:49.801 --> 01:13:54.780
<v Speaker 4>everything that you had have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I realized that what happens</v>

1580
01:13:54.781 --> 01:13:59.010
<v Speaker 4>when you smoke the best of the best is</v>
<v Speaker 4>it for me.</v>

1581
01:13:59.100 --> 01:14:01.380
<v Speaker 4>I have one hit and then I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't,</v>

1582
01:14:01.381 --> 01:14:03.000
<v Speaker 4>I'm in a coma,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one hit,</v>

1583
01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:07.510
<v Speaker 4>one hit and I am out or I'm like crazy</v>
<v Speaker 4>paranoid or a it.</v>

1584
01:14:07.650 --> 01:14:12.250
<v Speaker 4>But so now what I do is I just get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Usually if I'm going to get we'd rather</v>

1585
01:14:12.251 --> 01:14:13.810
<v Speaker 4>than edibles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just get,</v>

1586
01:14:14.740 --> 01:14:18.570
<v Speaker 4>just get stuff out of the shake jar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like five bucks a gram or whatever</v>

01:14:33.210 --> 01:14:36.280

<v Speaker 4>but you're only supposed to take six</v>

1594
01:14:36.281 --> 01:14:39.160
<v Speaker 4>pumps and you get a thousand milligrams</v>
<v Speaker 4>or something.</v>

1601
01:14:49.530 --> 01:14:52.930
<v Speaker 4>The whole bottle is that much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But milligrams of spray.</v>

1602
01:14:53.230 --> 01:14:53.770
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1603
01:14:53.770 --> 01:14:54.610
<v Speaker 4>Can I try it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

1604
01:14:54.910 --> 01:14:58.510
<v Speaker 4>That's probably under my tongue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I think there's some that are</v>

1605
01:14:58.511 --> 01:15:00.580
<v Speaker 4>more potent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This one's the most potent.</v>

1606
01:15:00.910 --> 01:15:02.560
<v Speaker 4>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this one that's the most potent.</v>

1607
01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:05.280
<v Speaker 4>This is the thousand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This was like a thousand milligrams</v>

1608
01:15:05.290 --> 01:15:07.210
<v Speaker 4>brown and you're not supposed to eat the</v>
<v Speaker 4>whole thing at one time.</v>

1609
01:15:07.211 --> 01:15:08.830
<v Speaker 4>You supposed to take like a nibble.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1610
01:15:08.831 --> 01:15:12.250
<v Speaker 4>he makes it 1,502,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is really problematic.</v>

1611
01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:16.280
<v Speaker 4>What I like about edibles is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is how it's measured in.</v>

1612
01:15:16.330 --> 01:15:19.840
<v Speaker 4>There seems to be like a little</v>
<v Speaker 4>difference in between brands and stuff,</v>

1613
01:15:19.841 --> 01:15:24.841
<v Speaker 4>but I know five milligrams now thing 10</v>
<v Speaker 4>milligrams just kind of feel a little</v>

1614
01:15:25.031 --> 01:15:26.560
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fifteen milligrams.</v>

1615
01:15:26.561 --> 01:15:31.561
<v Speaker 4>I'm starting to get high 20 now I'm high</v>
<v Speaker 4>25 now I'm really high and I don't do</v>

1616
01:15:31.811 --> 01:15:36.220
<v Speaker 4>more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I took 10 sprays and then did a podcast</v>

1617
01:15:36.250 --> 01:15:39.910
<v Speaker 4>and I was shitting my pants.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it might have been 12.</v>

1618
01:15:40.180 --> 01:15:43.570
<v Speaker 4>I might've done 12,</v>
<v Speaker 4>12 sprays and I did a podcast where the</v>

1619
01:15:43.571 --> 01:15:46.150
<v Speaker 4>whole time was doing the podcast as I</v>
<v Speaker 4>was skiing downhill.</v>

1620
01:15:46.420 --> 01:15:49.290
<v Speaker 4>Just hoping I didn't have to change like</v>
<v Speaker 4>an opening.</v>

1621
01:15:49.310 --> 01:15:51.670
<v Speaker 4>I didn't have to turn or avoided another</v>
<v Speaker 4>skier.</v>

1622
01:15:51.910 --> 01:15:52.930
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh Jesus.</v>

1623
01:15:53.260 --> 01:15:54.430
<v Speaker 4>Oh Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stay up.</v>

1624
01:15:54.670 --> 01:15:57.220
<v Speaker 4>Just stay up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1625
01:15:57.221 --> 01:15:58.380
<v Speaker 4>I uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1626
01:15:58.620 --> 01:16:01.600
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been high on stage probably 20</v>

1627
01:16:01.601 --> 01:16:04.840
<v Speaker 4>times in my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been doing comedy for like 12 years</v>

1628
01:16:04.841 --> 01:16:09.841
<v Speaker 4>or something like that and I probably</v>
<v Speaker 4>had 10 of those times where I felt like</v>

1629
01:16:10.630 --> 01:16:15.310
<v Speaker 4>I was giggling and having fun and it</v>
<v Speaker 4>helped the show and then I had 10 of</v>

1630
01:16:15.311 --> 01:16:18.760
<v Speaker 4>those times where I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't think straight,</v>

1631
01:16:18.761 --> 01:16:22.480
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't remember anything and it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>just not worth the risk for me.</v>

1632
01:16:22.570 --> 01:16:23.440
<v Speaker 4>It's total crap.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shoot.</v>

1633
01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:24.340
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1634
01:16:24.341 --> 01:16:28.660
<v Speaker 4>one time I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said the setup of one joke with the</v>

1635
01:16:28.661 --> 01:16:33.661
<v Speaker 4>punch line of another joke and at the</v>
<v Speaker 4>time like it was just a really hot</v>

1636
01:16:33.850 --> 01:16:38.500
<v Speaker 4>audience and I was doing really well and</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the time they laughed and I was like,</v>

1637
01:16:38.860 --> 01:16:40.480
<v Speaker 4>I realized why I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wait a second,</v>

1638
01:16:41.110 --> 01:16:44.860
<v Speaker 4>what are you guys laughing at?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I went back and I told both</v>

1639
01:16:44.890 --> 01:16:47.460
<v Speaker 4>jokes and explained what I screwed up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I like,</v>

1640
01:16:47.461 --> 01:16:50.860
<v Speaker 4>so I don't know what the fuck you guys</v>
<v Speaker 4>were laughing because what I said made</v>

1641
01:16:50.861 --> 01:16:53.410
<v Speaker 4>no sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it was just my inflection was</v>

1642
01:16:53.411 --> 01:16:55.210
<v Speaker 4>funny or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow,</v>

1643
01:16:55.211 --> 01:16:56.230
<v Speaker 4>that's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1644
01:16:56.410 --> 01:16:58.200
<v Speaker 4>Maybe they didn't want to seem stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1645
01:16:58.201 --> 01:16:59.560
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like one of those Dennis Miller</v>

1646
01:16:59.561 --> 01:17:02.650
<v Speaker 4>things laugh at as reference.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yes.</v>

1647
01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:04.600
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a heartbreaker for me.</v>

1648
01:17:04.601 --> 01:17:06.580
<v Speaker 4>Somebody told me he doesn't really know</v>
<v Speaker 4>what he's talking about,</v>

1649
01:17:06.581 --> 01:17:11.030
<v Speaker 4>that he just comes up with these really</v>
<v Speaker 4>obscure because they work well in a joke</v>

1650
01:17:11.031 --> 01:17:13.010
<v Speaker 4>for him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mcdonald told me that,</v>

1651
01:17:13.150 --> 01:17:14.660
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he doesn't even know those things.</v>

1652
01:17:15.030 --> 01:17:15.863
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

1653
01:17:16.310 --> 01:17:18.080
<v Speaker 4>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1654
01:17:18.230 --> 01:17:20.630
<v Speaker 4>there is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just had a podcast talking with a guy,</v>

1655
01:17:20.631 --> 01:17:24.620
<v Speaker 4>like one of the reasons why we laugh at</v>
<v Speaker 4>things is because is because you're,</v>

1656
01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:28.220
<v Speaker 4>you're conveying that you have that same</v>
<v Speaker 4>knowledge.</v>

1657
01:17:28.460 --> 01:17:29.480
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you get it,</v>

1658
01:17:29.510 --> 01:17:31.820
<v Speaker 4>that you understand the context for it</v>
<v Speaker 4>or whatever.</v>

1659
01:17:31.821 --> 01:17:36.821
<v Speaker 4>It's like advertising that you also know</v>
<v Speaker 4>this or you want to be in with the cool</v>

1660
01:17:37.850 --> 01:17:40.070
<v Speaker 4>crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Crowd knows the joke.</v>

1661
01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:41.450
<v Speaker 4>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's hilarious.</v>

1662
01:17:41.451 --> 01:17:42.031
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1663
01:17:42.031 --> 01:17:43.060
<v Speaker 4>Is it hilarious,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shane?</v>

1664
01:17:45.410 --> 01:17:47.790
<v Speaker 4>Because I want you to like me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know</v>

1665
01:17:49.450 --> 01:17:51.290
<v Speaker 4>it's weird that a lot of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some,</v>

1666
01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:54.290
<v Speaker 4>and I have plenty of movie references</v>
<v Speaker 4>and stuff now,</v>

1667
01:17:54.291 --> 01:17:56.300
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it seems like a lot of the,</v>

1668
01:17:56.930 --> 01:17:57.560
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1669
01:17:57.560 --> 01:18:01.490
<v Speaker 4>quote unquote like smart comedy these</v>
<v Speaker 4>days is just like movie references.</v>

1670
01:18:01.500 --> 01:18:02.031
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1671
01:18:02.031 --> 01:18:06.080
<v Speaker 4>why is that you watch a lot of TV,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I don't get why that's smart that,</v>

1672
01:18:06.081 --> 01:18:09.550
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of this obscure show that like you just</v>

1673
01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:10.930
<v Speaker 4>watch tv,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want,</v>

1674
01:18:10.980 --> 01:18:12.800
<v Speaker 4>you're going to alt rooms or something</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that,</v>

1675
01:18:12.801 --> 01:18:14.870
<v Speaker 4>is that happens in all rooms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's kind of.</v>

1676
01:18:15.410 --> 01:18:17.750
<v Speaker 4>But I mean I like art rooms as well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

1677
01:18:17.751 --> 01:18:19.070
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I,</v>

1678
01:18:19.150 --> 01:18:23.540
<v Speaker 4>I see that sometimes where I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's just a movie that no one knows</v>

1679
01:18:23.541 --> 01:18:26.780
<v Speaker 4>about that you watched.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I don't get why that's smart.</v>

1680
01:18:26.810 --> 01:18:29.580
<v Speaker 4>That's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not like addictive.</v>

1681
01:18:29.590 --> 01:18:31.400
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>intelligence is just like,</v>

1682
01:18:31.430 --> 01:18:32.840
<v Speaker 4>OOO,</v>
<v Speaker 4>other people don't know that.</v>

1683
01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:34.460
<v Speaker 4>So it seems like it's smart,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1684
01:18:34.461 --> 01:18:36.350
<v Speaker 4>You're clever because you remembered</v>
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>

1685
01:18:36.470 --> 01:18:37.880
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's pointless.</v>

1686
01:18:39.590 --> 01:18:42.890
<v Speaker 4>That was a complete waste of time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So back to this Kratom stuff,</v>

1687
01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:44.510
<v Speaker 4>would you buy it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1688
01:18:44.511 --> 01:18:48.110
<v Speaker 4>you can get it on a head shop or you can</v>
<v Speaker 4>get it online for about another week.</v>

1689
01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:51.690
<v Speaker 4>That is so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so then once it becomes schedule</v>

1690
01:18:51.691 --> 01:18:53.960
<v Speaker 4>one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it's like pot or heroin.</v>

1691
01:18:53.961 --> 01:18:55.430
<v Speaker 4>Like if you get caught with it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to jail.</v>

1692
01:18:55.730 --> 01:18:56.570
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>

1693
01:18:56.800 --> 01:19:01.610
<v Speaker 4>I mean the schedules don't necessarily</v>
<v Speaker 4>affect what the penalties are.</v>

1694
01:19:01.611 --> 01:19:05.300
<v Speaker 4>Like you'll get in more trouble for a</v>
<v Speaker 4>scheduled to cocaine then you will a</v>

1695
01:19:05.310 --> 01:19:07.760
<v Speaker 4>schedule one marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1696
01:19:07.820 --> 01:19:10.540
<v Speaker 4>but so I don't know what the actual</v>
<v Speaker 4>penalties will be for,</v>

1697
01:19:10.570 --> 01:19:12.260
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it will be a scheduled one.</v>

1698
01:19:12.261 --> 01:19:14.750
<v Speaker 4>So they didn't have to establish</v>
<v Speaker 4>penalties but to the established</v>

1699
01:19:14.751 --> 01:19:16.370
<v Speaker 4>penalties based on science.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1700
01:19:16.371 --> 01:19:19.190
<v Speaker 4>did they have any logic behind what</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're saying or they just know.</v>

1701
01:19:19.250 --> 01:19:19.631
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1702
01:19:19.631 --> 01:19:23.000
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they establish and any</v>

1703
01:19:23.001 --> 01:19:26.330
<v Speaker 4>penalties based on science.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think our prison system,</v>

1704
01:19:26.570 --> 01:19:29.780
<v Speaker 4>I think if the scientists were running</v>
<v Speaker 4>the prison system,</v>

1705
01:19:29.870 --> 01:19:32.630
<v Speaker 4>they would get scrap it and start all</v>
<v Speaker 4>over.</v>

1706
01:19:32.631 --> 01:19:34.850
<v Speaker 4>It'd be about reforming and</v>
<v Speaker 4>rehabilitation,</v>

1707
01:19:34.851 --> 01:19:37.880
<v Speaker 4>which is what it's supposed to be about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

1708
01:19:37.881 --> 01:19:38.990
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think.</v>

1709
01:19:39.590 --> 01:19:44.590
<v Speaker 4>I don't think we're doing great science</v>
<v Speaker 4>with our prison system in any way he</v>

1710
01:19:44.691 --> 01:19:47.510
<v Speaker 4>had.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The whole thing is just one person</v>

1711
01:19:47.511 --> 01:19:51.680
<v Speaker 4>telling another person what they can and</v>
<v Speaker 4>cannot put in their body where you can't</v>

1712
01:19:51.681 --> 01:19:53.480
<v Speaker 4>demonstrate that it's hurting anybody</v>
<v Speaker 4>else,</v>

1713
01:19:53.481 --> 01:19:55.550
<v Speaker 4>but that person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to me that's like,</v>

1714
01:19:55.551 --> 01:19:56.540
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if that's the case,</v>

1715
01:19:56.570 --> 01:19:59.720
<v Speaker 4>well why is it okay to rock climb?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was rock climbing is obviously</v>

1716
01:19:59.721 --> 01:20:01.670
<v Speaker 4>dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why is it okay to Bungee jump?</v>

1717
01:20:01.700 --> 01:20:04.200
<v Speaker 4>Why is it okay to jump out of airplanes?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1718
01:20:04.230 --> 01:20:07.170
<v Speaker 4>that stuff's all legal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can't take this kratom stuff and</v>

1719
01:20:07.171 --> 01:20:08.004
<v Speaker 4>you can.</v>

1720
01:20:08.110 --> 01:20:09.540
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you can,</v>

1721
01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:12.060
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>where is it that they,</v>

1722
01:20:12.150 --> 01:20:17.150
<v Speaker 7>that they use those bullet ants and like</v>
<v Speaker 7>put them on their hands and like you can</v>

1723
01:20:17.881 --> 01:20:22.881
<v Speaker 7>trip doing that from the pain.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The pain is so intense that they trip</v>

1724
01:20:23.161 --> 01:20:25.020
<v Speaker 7>like they do with this during</v>
<v Speaker 7>ceremonies.</v>

1725
01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:30.050
<v Speaker 7>You can run a marathon and get into a</v>
<v Speaker 7>transcendental state because your body's</v>

1726
01:20:30.060 --> 01:20:34.530
<v Speaker 7>going through such torture that it goes</v>
<v Speaker 7>into this different part of your brain</v>

1727
01:20:34.531 --> 01:20:37.080
<v Speaker 7>that pushes you through it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And um,</v>

1728
01:20:37.350 --> 01:20:39.780
<v Speaker 7>I mean you can hallucinate from lack of</v>
<v Speaker 7>sleep.</v>

1729
01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:40.840
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>

1730
01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:43.620
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>for for like six months in my life,</v>

1731
01:20:43.621 --> 01:20:46.890
<v Speaker 7>I was trying to do the thing where every</v>
<v Speaker 7>two hours you sleep for like 20 minutes</v>

1732
01:20:46.891 --> 01:20:49.860
<v Speaker 7>or whatever for how long,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like six months.</v>

1733
01:20:50.630 --> 01:20:53.250
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I like trying like crazy weird different</v>

1734
01:20:53.251 --> 01:20:56.760
<v Speaker 7>things and um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I go on all these weird different kicks.</v>

1735
01:20:56.780 --> 01:20:58.260
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it was a nightmare.</v>

1736
01:20:58.260 --> 01:21:01.800
<v Speaker 7>I started hallucinating after awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So explain every two hours you sleep for</v>

1737
01:21:01.801 --> 01:21:04.710
<v Speaker 7>20 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I would set the alarm for like 20</v>

1738
01:21:04.711 --> 01:21:09.070
<v Speaker 7>minutes and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1739
01:21:09.380 --> 01:21:12.420
<v Speaker 7>so I was,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it was before as a comedian and it was,</v>

1740
01:21:12.421 --> 01:21:15.270
<v Speaker 7>I was trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was trying to,</v>

1741
01:21:15.720 --> 01:21:19.200
<v Speaker 7>I was working third shift in a factory</v>
<v Speaker 7>and then at the same time I was going to</v>

1742
01:21:19.201 --> 01:21:21.660
<v Speaker 7>school,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like just tech school for like a backup</v>

1743
01:21:21.661 --> 01:21:22.980
<v Speaker 7>plan.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I wanted to be a comedian,</v>

1744
01:21:22.981 --> 01:21:25.640
<v Speaker 7>but I also like very scared and didn't</v>
<v Speaker 7>know how to start and,</v>

1745
01:21:26.220 --> 01:21:30.720
<v Speaker 7>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and so I was taking like 16 or 18</v>

1746
01:21:30.721 --> 01:21:33.150
<v Speaker 7>credits or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And um,</v>

1747
01:21:33.270 --> 01:21:36.090
<v Speaker 7>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and I also had a social life,</v>

1748
01:21:36.091 --> 01:21:38.880
<v Speaker 7>so I was every two hours I just had a</v>
<v Speaker 7>time to take a nap.</v>

1749
01:21:39.150 --> 01:21:41.340
<v Speaker 7>And the crazy thing was,</v>
<v Speaker 7>is all ran together.</v>

1750
01:21:41.341 --> 01:21:44.430
<v Speaker 7>So if I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if I was in there for a lecture,</v>

1751
01:21:44.431 --> 01:21:46.320
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Monday and then,</v>

1752
01:21:46.610 --> 01:21:48.780
<v Speaker 7>and then on Friday there was a test on</v>
<v Speaker 7>it.</v>

1753
01:21:49.020 --> 01:21:51.360
<v Speaker 7>It was as if I just heard it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it was like,</v>

1754
01:21:51.361 --> 01:21:52.920
<v Speaker 7>it was all one day,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it was like,</v>

1755
01:21:52.921 --> 01:21:56.490
<v Speaker 7>can't we just talked about this</v>
<v Speaker 7>really weird.</v>

1756
01:21:56.880 --> 01:21:59.580
<v Speaker 7>And then I tried taking supplements and</v>
<v Speaker 7>stuff like that too,</v>

1757
01:21:59.581 --> 01:22:04.581
<v Speaker 7>like do energy boosting things and um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and then one day,</v>

1758
01:22:05.910 --> 01:22:10.500
<v Speaker 7>one day my eye,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I got anal leakage from like all these</v>

1759
01:22:10.770 --> 01:22:15.090
<v Speaker 7>supplements I was taking and then I</v>
<v Speaker 7>decided to stop doing that.</v>

1760
01:22:15.091 --> 01:22:18.630
<v Speaker 7>It was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it was like a Tan,</v>

1761
01:22:18.990 --> 01:22:23.100
<v Speaker 7>a oily</v>
<v Speaker 7>oil.</v>

1762
01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:25.030
<v Speaker 7>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know what,</v>

1763
01:22:25.090 --> 01:22:27.910
<v Speaker 7>this isn't worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I and I dropped out of school,</v>

1764
01:22:28.410 --> 01:22:33.090
<v Speaker 7>Jesus Christ and started sleeping</v>
<v Speaker 7>regularly and a weird life.</v>

1765
01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:34.980
<v Speaker 7>So if you went out like at 9:00 at</v>
<v Speaker 7>night,</v>

1766
01:22:34.981 --> 01:22:37.860
<v Speaker 7>you and your friends went out,</v>
<v Speaker 7>would you go somewhere at 11 and take a</v>

1767
01:22:37.861 --> 01:22:38.950
<v Speaker 7>nap?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh yeah,</v>

1768
01:22:39.690 --> 01:22:41.490
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I couldn't go out that often.</v>

1769
01:22:41.491 --> 01:22:44.800
<v Speaker 7>But then most of the most ridiculous</v>
<v Speaker 7>things I've ever heard,</v>

1770
01:22:45.110 --> 01:22:49.830
<v Speaker 7>which she takes 20 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>two hours later,</v>

1771
01:22:49.831 --> 01:22:50.700
<v Speaker 7>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you guys want to eat?</v>

1772
01:22:50.701 --> 01:22:54.330
<v Speaker 7>And I got to take a nap.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'll meet you guys there.</v>

1773
01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:57.060
<v Speaker 7>The thing was,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if you didn't like follow the schedule</v>

1774
01:22:57.090 --> 01:22:59.880
<v Speaker 7>really strictly is when,</v>
<v Speaker 7>when you'd get fucked.</v>

1775
01:22:59.881 --> 01:23:03.060
<v Speaker 7>So if I did end up having some drinks or</v>
<v Speaker 7>something like that and hanging out with</v>

1776
01:23:03.061 --> 01:23:06.100
<v Speaker 7>friends and not doing that nap or if I</v>
<v Speaker 7>was at work in</v>

1777
01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:08.060
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't get my break when I suppose</v>

1778
01:23:08.061 --> 01:23:09.430
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1779
01:23:09.670 --> 01:23:11.230
<v Speaker 4>it would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would really fucked me up.</v>

1780
01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:13.870
<v Speaker 4>And I started hallucinating when I was</v>
<v Speaker 4>driving.</v>

1781
01:23:13.871 --> 01:23:16.730
<v Speaker 4>I fell asleep behind the wheel once and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

1782
01:23:16.750 --> 01:23:19.720
<v Speaker 4>like almost crashed my car,</v>
<v Speaker 4>went into a ditch and was able to drive</v>

1783
01:23:19.721 --> 01:23:21.120
<v Speaker 4>out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I,</v>

1784
01:23:21.140 --> 01:23:23.050
<v Speaker 4>I've put an end to that experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>

1785
01:23:23.051 --> 01:23:25.540
<v Speaker 4>last week I couldn't believe I did it</v>
<v Speaker 4>for as long as I did.</v>

1786
01:23:25.570 --> 01:23:27.130
<v Speaker 4>Looking back on it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

1787
01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:29.410
<v Speaker 4>it didn't seem that crazy to me at the</v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

1788
01:23:29.411 --> 01:23:30.130
<v Speaker 4>I don't know why.</v>

1789
01:23:30.130 --> 01:23:35.130
<v Speaker 3>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is a 12 hours at 20 minutes?</v>

1790
01:23:35.171 --> 01:23:37.210
<v Speaker 3>Because it's half,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's double right every,</v>

1791
01:23:37.211 --> 01:23:40.180
<v Speaker 3>every two hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So 12 hours at 20 minutes.</v>

1792
01:23:40.510 --> 01:23:42.430
<v Speaker 3>So you were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're essentially sleeping in.</v>

1793
01:23:42.750 --> 01:23:44.610
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like four hours a day I guess,</v>

1794
01:23:46.190 --> 01:23:50.210
<v Speaker 3>but by doing it in these long stretches</v>
<v Speaker 3>where two hours and 20 minutes,</v>

1795
01:23:50.211 --> 01:23:53.000
<v Speaker 3>two hours and 20 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You never really get into like heavy rem</v>

1796
01:23:53.001 --> 01:23:53.834
<v Speaker 3>sleep or.</v>

1797
01:23:53.850 --> 01:23:55.050
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so.</v>

1798
01:23:55.200 --> 01:23:56.030
<v Speaker 4>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would,</v>

1799
01:23:56.030 --> 01:23:58.770
<v Speaker 4>I would start to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would like wake up in a little bit of</v>

1800
01:23:58.771 --> 01:24:00.720
<v Speaker 4>a dream state.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1801
01:24:01.170 --> 01:24:02.280
<v Speaker 4>It was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Weird.</v>

1802
01:24:02.281 --> 01:24:04.020
<v Speaker 4>Don't recommend it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did it for six months.</v>

1803
01:24:04.021 --> 01:24:05.660
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's amazing that you have that kind</v>

1804
01:24:05.661 --> 01:24:10.320
<v Speaker 4>of like sticktuitiveness</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I get focused on something like.</v>

1805
01:24:10.321 --> 01:24:11.400
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1806
01:24:11.490 --> 01:24:12.960
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the point is,</v>

1807
01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:16.770
<v Speaker 4>is there's a million ways to trip.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't stop people from tripping.</v>

1808
01:24:16.830 --> 01:24:18.810
<v Speaker 4>Have you done the holotropic breathing</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing?</v>

1809
01:24:18.980 --> 01:24:20.010
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1810
01:24:20.011 --> 01:24:22.110
<v Speaker 4>but I just started hearing about this</v>
<v Speaker 4>recently.</v>

1811
01:24:22.111 --> 01:24:23.050
<v Speaker 4>Can you explain it to me?</v>

1812
01:24:23.290 --> 01:24:25.180
<v Speaker 3>Done it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had a friend and my friend rob has</v>

1813
01:24:25.181 --> 01:24:27.320
<v Speaker 3>done it several times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a,</v>

1814
01:24:27.700 --> 01:24:30.040
<v Speaker 3>there's people who really know how to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>it correctly.</v>

1815
01:24:30.041 --> 01:24:33.730
<v Speaker 3>There's a couple of different states.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wolfen or what's that guy's name?</v>

1816
01:24:33.820 --> 01:24:34.120
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1817
01:24:34.120 --> 01:24:38.350
<v Speaker 3>Wim Hoff Hoff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Similar Wim Hof has some pretty some</v>

1818
01:24:38.351 --> 01:24:40.360
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic aspects to his breathing</v>
<v Speaker 3>technique.</v>

1819
01:24:40.361 --> 01:24:42.280
<v Speaker 3>I think too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It definitely puts you in a state of</v>

1820
01:24:42.281 --> 01:24:44.680
<v Speaker 3>mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the holotropic breathing thing,</v>

1821
01:24:44.681 --> 01:24:47.740
<v Speaker 3>somehow or another,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it forces your body into a psychedelic</v>

1822
01:24:47.741 --> 01:24:49.450
<v Speaker 3>state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had actually a couple people that</v>

1823
01:24:49.451 --> 01:24:51.040
<v Speaker 3>have done it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It takes awhile,</v>

1824
01:24:51.250 --> 01:24:54.450
<v Speaker 3>but through the specific style of</v>
<v Speaker 3>breathing cv find it Jamie.</v>

1825
01:24:54.460 --> 01:24:56.410
<v Speaker 3>So we could tell people what the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about.</v>

1826
01:24:56.440 --> 01:24:58.750
<v Speaker 3>I haven't done it obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>

1827
01:24:59.140 --> 01:25:02.500
<v Speaker 3>I know of several people who do</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kundalini Yoga,</v>

1828
01:25:02.830 --> 01:25:07.720
<v Speaker 3>who have also done dmt and they say that</v>
<v Speaker 3>through coon Daleney practice.</v>

1829
01:25:07.721 --> 01:25:10.000
<v Speaker 3>When you get deep into it on a regular</v>
<v Speaker 3>basis,</v>

1830
01:25:10.001 --> 01:25:14.590
<v Speaker 3>when you do it daily,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can achieve dmt like states on the</v>

1831
01:25:14.591 --> 01:25:15.400
<v Speaker 3>natch.</v>

1832
01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:18.610
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went since doing dmt.</v>

1833
01:25:18.611 --> 01:25:23.611
<v Speaker 4>Now if I much mushrooms I can meditate</v>
<v Speaker 4>myself into a dmt state for like five to</v>

1834
01:25:24.401 --> 01:25:26.900
<v Speaker 4>10 minutes while you're on mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1835
01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:28.630
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did mushrooms in a float tank</v>

1836
01:25:28.660 --> 01:25:30.930
<v Speaker 4>recently.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I the.</v>

1837
01:25:31.690 --> 01:25:34.690
<v Speaker 4>And that was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it's because of how much</v>

1838
01:25:34.691 --> 01:25:37.840
<v Speaker 4>dmt I do or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that was like a dmt trip to me.</v>

1839
01:25:37.930 --> 01:25:40.840
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was like a little more controlled and</v>

1840
01:25:40.841 --> 01:25:42.970
<v Speaker 4>I could pop out of it anytime that I</v>
<v Speaker 4>wanted to.</v>

1841
01:25:42.971 --> 01:25:47.260
<v Speaker 4>But that was like for four.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it would take me like five</v>

1842
01:25:47.261 --> 01:25:49.740
<v Speaker 4>minutes to get into it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1843
01:25:50.110 --> 01:25:55.110
<v Speaker 4>and then within five minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I had music playing inside of my</v>

1844
01:25:55.721 --> 01:25:59.950
<v Speaker 4>head and like these crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like dmt stories happening in different</v>

1845
01:25:59.951 --> 01:26:04.720
<v Speaker 4>worlds that I was seeing and like</v>
<v Speaker 4>palaces and unlike other areas with like</v>

1846
01:26:04.730 --> 01:26:07.040
<v Speaker 4>scary,</v>
<v Speaker 4>weird clowns and stuff like that.</v>

1847
01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:10.010
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I was the best trip of my life</v>

1848
01:26:10.011 --> 01:26:14.630
<v Speaker 4>and it was like full on hallucinations</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I did float tanks a couple times</v>

1849
01:26:14.631 --> 01:26:16.820
<v Speaker 4>just sober and I never really saw</v>
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>

1850
01:26:16.850 --> 01:26:19.760
<v Speaker 4>I didn't like hallucinate or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just kinda like meditation on</v>

1851
01:26:19.761 --> 01:26:20.800
<v Speaker 4>steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I felt like</v>

1852
01:26:20.920 --> 01:26:22.690
<v Speaker 3>that definitely like meditation on</v>
<v Speaker 3>steroids,</v>

1853
01:26:22.691 --> 01:26:26.460
<v Speaker 3>but flow tanks or something where the</v>
<v Speaker 3>more comfortable you get with the more</v>

1854
01:26:26.630 --> 01:26:28.900
<v Speaker 3>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the easier you slip into it.</v>

1855
01:26:29.260 --> 01:26:32.470
<v Speaker 3>So the quicker you slip into it into</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when I go into it,</v>

1856
01:26:32.471 --> 01:26:36.460
<v Speaker 3>I've done it so many times now because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's in my house that I lay down and my</v>

1857
01:26:36.461 --> 01:26:37.630
<v Speaker 3>body goes up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here we go again.</v>

1858
01:26:37.690 --> 01:26:40.750
<v Speaker 3>Good to good times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just relaxed like I've done it.</v>

1859
01:26:40.751 --> 01:26:43.540
<v Speaker 3>Like it's not like when we go to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't believe I'm floating like those</v>

1860
01:26:43.541 --> 01:26:47.320
<v Speaker 3>states of mind that you get to when</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're in that I don't.</v>

1861
01:26:47.350 --> 01:26:49.840
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe I'm floating thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It takes you a while to relax.</v>

1862
01:26:50.230 --> 01:26:52.240
<v Speaker 3>Floating around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're bumping against the wall.</v>

1863
01:26:52.241 --> 01:26:56.470
<v Speaker 3>You're trying to center yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that state though combined with</v>

1864
01:26:56.471 --> 01:26:58.960
<v Speaker 3>the mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this has gotta be an accelerant.</v>

1865
01:26:59.140 --> 01:27:03.360
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you've done that mushrooms and ended</v>

1866
01:27:03.370 --> 01:27:05.140
<v Speaker 4>up bringing on hallucinations for you as</v>
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>

1867
01:27:05.540 --> 01:27:09.140
<v Speaker 3>The strongest hallucinations honestly is</v>
<v Speaker 3>from too much edibles.</v>

1868
01:27:09.770 --> 01:27:13.170
<v Speaker 3>I've had too much edibles where I went</v>
<v Speaker 3>into the tank where I just got to when</v>

1869
01:27:13.180 --> 01:27:18.180
<v Speaker 3>we're going to die and you get in there</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I just have had full blown.</v>

1870
01:27:18.860 --> 01:27:23.860
<v Speaker 3>I had this one insane intense experience</v>
<v Speaker 3>where I felt like I was in a jungle,</v>

1871
01:27:25.490 --> 01:27:29.600
<v Speaker 3>like I was in a jungle and I was walking</v>
<v Speaker 3>through the jungle with these people and</v>

1872
01:27:29.930 --> 01:27:34.930
<v Speaker 3>they were all speaking the language and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understood the language and in my mind</v>

1873
01:27:35.060 --> 01:27:38.390
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking in their language and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I realized it.</v>

1874
01:27:38.391 --> 01:27:39.290
<v Speaker 3>I went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

1875
01:27:39.291 --> 01:27:41.420
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking of this other lane,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I'm out of it.</v>

1876
01:27:41.940 --> 01:27:45.110
<v Speaker 3>It went away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for the brief few moments where it</v>

1877
01:27:45.111 --> 01:27:48.230
<v Speaker 3>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I could remember feeling that the</v>

1878
01:27:48.590 --> 01:27:53.590
<v Speaker 3>dew on the ground and feeling the leaves</v>
<v Speaker 3>under my feet and walking through the</v>

1879
01:27:54.081 --> 01:27:55.310
<v Speaker 3>jungle with these people.</v>

1880
01:27:56.150 --> 01:28:00.230
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of folks that believe that</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reason why we have instincts,</v>

1881
01:28:00.260 --> 01:28:02.870
<v Speaker 3>the reason why you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like an animal comes out of its mother's</v>

1882
01:28:03.470 --> 01:28:07.060
<v Speaker 3>body immediately goes to the breast and</v>
<v Speaker 3>instinctively start sucking at.</v>

1883
01:28:07.070 --> 01:28:12.070
<v Speaker 3>There's certain data that's just encoded</v>
<v Speaker 3>in our body and when it comes from is</v>

1884
01:28:12.230 --> 01:28:16.670
<v Speaker 3>the experiences of all the different</v>
<v Speaker 3>beings that existed before us,</v>

1885
01:28:16.671 --> 01:28:20.930
<v Speaker 3>that bread and eventually became us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That this is just massive database of</v>

1886
01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:23.900
<v Speaker 3>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All your ancestors and they're all sort</v>

1887
01:28:23.901 --> 01:28:27.650
<v Speaker 3>of collected together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the idea is that occasionally you can</v>

1888
01:28:27.710 --> 01:28:32.450
<v Speaker 3>tap into some distant memory that's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>locked in like,</v>

1889
01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:33.560
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look what I found.</v>

1890
01:28:33.590 --> 01:28:35.720
<v Speaker 3>It's our high school yearbook.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is crazy.</v>

1891
01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:40.850
<v Speaker 3>And you open up what's essentially your</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dnas high school yearbook from some</v>

1892
01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:45.650
<v Speaker 3>fucking Subsaharan experience when you</v>
<v Speaker 3>were half a monkey person.</v>

1893
01:28:45.870 --> 01:28:48.780
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lakers are stored in DNA or something</v>

1894
01:28:48.781 --> 01:28:49.614
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1895
01:28:49.660 --> 01:28:52.050
<v Speaker 4>so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean my,</v>

1896
01:28:52.250 --> 01:28:54.740
<v Speaker 4>my scientific mind would just say that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1897
01:28:54.760 --> 01:28:59.760
<v Speaker 4>it genes that are set up to have this</v>
<v Speaker 4>inclination to uh,</v>

1898
01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:03.770
<v Speaker 4>suck on your tits ended up being,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1899
01:29:04.100 --> 01:29:06.120
<v Speaker 4>passed on easier and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

1900
01:29:06.250 --> 01:29:07.890
<v Speaker 4>and whatnot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I have,</v>

1901
01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:09.940
<v Speaker 4>I've had full on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1902
01:29:10.390 --> 01:29:14.400
<v Speaker 4>I remember specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a mushroom trip like 10 years ago</v>

1903
01:29:14.700 --> 01:29:18.510
<v Speaker 4>where I must have taken a ton.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What happened was I was blackout drunk,</v>

1904
01:29:18.650 --> 01:29:21.000
<v Speaker 4>I took mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember any of it.</v>

1905
01:29:21.300 --> 01:29:25.200
<v Speaker 4>And then I must've passed out and I just</v>
<v Speaker 4>woke up a trip.</v>

1906
01:29:25.330 --> 01:29:27.420
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It took me like a couple minutes to</v>

1907
01:29:27.421 --> 01:29:28.830
<v Speaker 4>realize what was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1908
01:29:28.831 --> 01:29:30.360
<v Speaker 4>am I dreaming?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did I go crazy?</v>

1909
01:29:30.361 --> 01:29:31.170
<v Speaker 4>What happened,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1910
01:29:31.170 --> 01:29:33.240
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had mushrooms in the fridge.</v>

1911
01:29:33.241 --> 01:29:34.620
<v Speaker 4>I bet I gobbled those things.</v>

1912
01:29:35.010 --> 01:29:40.010
<v Speaker 4>And then I closed my eyes and I saw,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw like inside my brain was kind of</v>

1913
01:29:40.621 --> 01:29:42.450
<v Speaker 4>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1914
01:29:43.110 --> 01:29:46.230
<v Speaker 4>the opening scene of fight club with</v>
<v Speaker 4>like electricity shooting around</v>

1915
01:29:46.231 --> 01:29:47.011
<v Speaker 4>different neurons,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>

1916
01:29:47.011 --> 01:29:49.500
<v Speaker 4>blah blah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then it zoomed in and then I saw</v>

1917
01:29:49.501 --> 01:29:52.830
<v Speaker 4>like an individual neuron and then it</v>
<v Speaker 4>zoomed in and then I saw like a strip of</v>

1918
01:29:52.831 --> 01:29:57.831
<v Speaker 4>DNA and then it zoomed in and then I saw</v>
<v Speaker 4>like this little section of Dna and then</v>

1919
01:29:57.911 --> 01:30:02.280
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then it just exploded and I saw all</v>

1920
01:30:02.281 --> 01:30:05.340
<v Speaker 4>of life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like going all the way back to.</v>

1921
01:30:05.550 --> 01:30:07.410
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I saw like all these different</v>

1922
01:30:07.411 --> 01:30:11.520
<v Speaker 4>battles and stuff and I'm like my</v>
<v Speaker 4>ancestors.</v>

1923
01:30:11.521 --> 01:30:15.420
<v Speaker 4>And then it went all the way back to</v>
<v Speaker 4>like being monkeys and all that and went</v>

1924
01:30:15.421 --> 01:30:18.840
<v Speaker 4>back to like this first little plant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>see the,</v>

1925
01:30:18.841 --> 01:30:23.841
<v Speaker 4>like springing spring sprouting and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then it was over.</v>

1926
01:30:24.331 --> 01:30:26.070
<v Speaker 4>And that's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1927
01:30:26.130 --> 01:30:29.010
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't an accurate representation of</v>

1928
01:30:29.011 --> 01:30:32.280
<v Speaker 4>the history of evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's still insane that my brain was</v>

1929
01:30:32.281 --> 01:30:34.080
<v Speaker 4>able to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pardon me?</v>

1930
01:30:34.240 --> 01:30:35.380
<v Speaker 3>Creativity though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1931
01:30:35.381 --> 01:30:38.560
<v Speaker 3>isn't that you're bringing on mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absorbing information that you already</v>

1932
01:30:38.561 --> 01:30:41.470
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of manipulating it and</v>

1933
01:30:41.710 --> 01:30:43.720
<v Speaker 4>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it will be hard to have a</v>

1934
01:30:43.721 --> 01:30:44.590
<v Speaker 4>mechanism where</v>

1935
01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:47.210
<v Speaker 3>memories are stored and the problem with</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1936
01:30:47.300 --> 01:30:50.660
<v Speaker 3>there's been studies done that show that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they exist and here's what they did.</v>

1937
01:30:50.661 --> 01:30:55.661
<v Speaker 3>They took these rats or mice and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>put a citrus spray in the air and then</v>

1938
01:30:56.541 --> 01:30:59.150
<v Speaker 3>they electrocuted their feet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so every time they sprayed the citrus</v>

1939
01:30:59.151 --> 01:31:01.240
<v Speaker 3>smell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they gave them a charge on their feet</v>

1940
01:31:01.241 --> 01:31:05.480
<v Speaker 3>and they're hurt them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their children who never experienced any</v>

1941
01:31:05.481 --> 01:31:09.380
<v Speaker 3>of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their DNA from these mice created these</v>

1942
01:31:09.381 --> 01:31:10.910
<v Speaker 3>children.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The children,</v>

1943
01:31:10.940 --> 01:31:14.570
<v Speaker 3>they would spray the citrus spray in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>air and they would automatically have</v>

1944
01:31:14.571 --> 01:31:17.210
<v Speaker 3>this terror response.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they would freak out.</v>

1945
01:31:17.240 --> 01:31:20.330
<v Speaker 3>They have accelerated panic level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>measurable.</v>

1946
01:31:20.660 --> 01:31:23.420
<v Speaker 3>So they realized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they weren't pregnant when they did</v>

1947
01:31:23.421 --> 01:31:24.480
<v Speaker 3>this or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

1948
01:31:24.530 --> 01:31:25.400
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>

1949
01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:27.590
<v Speaker 3>They.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had a significant amount of time</v>

1950
01:31:27.650 --> 01:31:31.550
<v Speaker 3>between the actual experiences and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they're pregnant and you know,</v>

1951
01:31:31.910 --> 01:31:33.260
<v Speaker 3>rats and mice and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

1952
01:31:33.261 --> 01:31:37.820
<v Speaker 3>they're not pregnant for very long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I think a rat is pregnant for like</v>

1953
01:31:37.821 --> 01:31:41.210
<v Speaker 3>16 days or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they give birth,</v>

1954
01:31:41.250 --> 01:31:42.980
<v Speaker 3>something crazy like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's what I am.</v>

1955
01:31:42.981 --> 01:31:44.090
<v Speaker 3>A hamster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I'm,</v>

1956
01:31:44.150 --> 01:31:47.660
<v Speaker 3>maybe I'm confusing hamster,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a hamster is pregnant for like 16</v>

1957
01:31:47.661 --> 01:31:50.630
<v Speaker 3>days and shit's out a letter and then 16</v>
<v Speaker 3>days later get pregnant again.</v>

1958
01:31:51.260 --> 01:31:54.920
<v Speaker 3>They could just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so 21 days for a wrap.</v>

1959
01:31:55.070 --> 01:31:55.903
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1960
01:31:55.910 --> 01:31:57.230
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's real quick.</v>

1961
01:31:57.320 --> 01:31:59.920
<v Speaker 3>So they did these studies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1962
01:32:00.150 --> 01:32:03.910
<v Speaker 6>they torture these little nieces,</v>
<v Speaker 6>zap their feet with that citrus spray in</v>

1963
01:32:03.911 --> 01:32:07.900
<v Speaker 6>the air and then there's a clear</v>
<v Speaker 6>indication that that memory of that</v>

1964
01:32:07.901 --> 01:32:11.230
<v Speaker 6>smell being attached to danger was</v>
<v Speaker 6>transmitted to their children.</v>

1965
01:32:12.940 --> 01:32:13.950
<v Speaker 6>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1966
01:32:14.650 --> 01:32:16.870
<v Speaker 6>So this is why I think,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

1967
01:32:17.110 --> 01:32:18.700
<v Speaker 6>it only makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1968
01:32:18.701 --> 01:32:22.030
<v Speaker 6>I don't know why people would be</v>
<v Speaker 6>incredulous about it because how else do</v>

1969
01:32:22.031 --> 01:32:23.200
<v Speaker 6>we get all these instincts?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1970
01:32:23.201 --> 01:32:27.160
<v Speaker 6>why would we assume that memories are</v>
<v Speaker 6>not somehow or another stored in the</v>

1971
01:32:27.161 --> 01:32:30.540
<v Speaker 6>very genetic meet like well members and</v>
<v Speaker 6>more bright?</v>

1972
01:32:30.541 --> 01:32:32.620
<v Speaker 6>It's in my hard drive.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I take it out.</v>

1973
01:32:32.621 --> 01:32:35.590
<v Speaker 6>I move it around.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Know your memory somehow or another is</v>

1974
01:32:35.591 --> 01:32:38.410
<v Speaker 6>in your consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We don't exactly know where.</v>

1975
01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:40.810
<v Speaker 6>We know when areas of the brain get</v>
<v Speaker 6>injured.</v>

1976
01:32:40.811 --> 01:32:44.080
<v Speaker 6>It affects memory.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We know that it could very well be that</v>

1977
01:32:44.110 --> 01:32:46.510
<v Speaker 6>the areas of the brain are involved in</v>
<v Speaker 6>processing memory,</v>

1978
01:32:46.660 --> 01:32:48.430
<v Speaker 6>not necessarily storing memory.</v>

1979
01:32:48.670 --> 01:32:50.870
<v Speaker 6>We don't know really.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Whoa.</v>

1980
01:32:50.920 --> 01:32:55.030
<v Speaker 6>Realistically that there's only one a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like there's certain things like dmt is</v>

1981
01:32:55.031 --> 01:32:58.120
<v Speaker 6>produced not just in the brain but it's</v>
<v Speaker 6>also produced in the liver and in the</v>

1982
01:32:58.121 --> 01:32:59.650
<v Speaker 6>lungs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They know this for a fact,</v>

1983
01:32:59.890 --> 01:33:04.890
<v Speaker 6>so it's one of those things where maybe</v>
<v Speaker 6>other things are stored in other parts</v>

1984
01:33:06.221 --> 01:33:09.850
<v Speaker 6>of the body.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We just assume that the very body itself</v>

1985
01:33:09.970 --> 01:33:13.240
<v Speaker 6>doesn't have some sort of memory,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you know when you talk to people</v>

1986
01:33:13.241 --> 01:33:16.420
<v Speaker 6>that have limbs that have been removed,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they have phantom itches and things</v>

1987
01:33:16.421 --> 01:33:19.930
<v Speaker 6>along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's one explanation for that</v>

1988
01:33:19.931 --> 01:33:22.380
<v Speaker 6>phenomenon is that you have a memory.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Your,</v>

1989
01:33:22.440 --> 01:33:25.090
<v Speaker 6>your actual tissue has a memory of that</v>
<v Speaker 6>limb.</v>

1990
01:33:26.100 --> 01:33:27.500
<v Speaker 7>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>

1991
01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:29.860
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well there's also a body map in,</v>

1992
01:33:29.940 --> 01:33:32.770
<v Speaker 7>in the brain and um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

1993
01:33:32.771 --> 01:33:34.270
<v Speaker 7>maybe that's why she's a good example.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1994
01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:36.220
<v Speaker 7>But the mice examples,</v>
<v Speaker 7>probably the best one.</v>

1995
01:33:36.430 --> 01:33:39.040
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it does make me think of how,</v>

1996
01:33:39.130 --> 01:33:42.280
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how information from our environment</v>

1997
01:33:42.460 --> 01:33:43.820
<v Speaker 7>can,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

1998
01:33:43.990 --> 01:33:48.040
<v Speaker 7>can affect the fetal environment.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like females,</v>

1999
01:33:49.240 --> 01:33:54.240
<v Speaker 7>females in lower income places or are in</v>
<v Speaker 7>lower parts of the social kind of</v>

2000
01:33:55.650 --> 01:34:00.550
<v Speaker 7>hierarchy in humans will tend to have.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And there's all these different species</v>

2001
01:34:00.551 --> 01:34:03.580
<v Speaker 7>that have where the species can kind of</v>
<v Speaker 7>pick,</v>

2002
01:34:03.940 --> 01:34:06.280
<v Speaker 7>depending on the environment,</v>
<v Speaker 7>whether it's going to be a male or</v>

2003
01:34:06.281 --> 01:34:11.281
<v Speaker 7>female.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So lower status females tend to have a</v>

2004
01:34:11.351 --> 01:34:16.150
<v Speaker 7>daughter is more in like the kings that</v>
<v Speaker 7>are higher status tend to have more sons</v>

2005
01:34:16.151 --> 01:34:18.250
<v Speaker 7>because sons,</v>
<v Speaker 7>sons,</v>

2006
01:34:18.251 --> 01:34:22.360
<v Speaker 7>if they're doing very well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>have the opportunity to make a bunch and</v>

2007
01:34:22.390 --> 01:34:24.400
<v Speaker 7>spread their genes on quite a bit more.</v>

2008
01:34:24.610 --> 01:34:26.200
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but a female,</v>

2009
01:34:26.201 --> 01:34:29.470
<v Speaker 7>even if it's like a lower status female</v>
<v Speaker 7>or low income or whatever,</v>

2010
01:34:29.471 --> 01:34:31.840
<v Speaker 7>female can always have at least a couple</v>
<v Speaker 7>of children.</v>

2011
01:34:31.841 --> 01:34:35.170
<v Speaker 7>Whereas a lot of men get kind of our</v>
<v Speaker 7>evolutionary dead ends,</v>

2012
01:34:35.230 --> 01:34:35.950
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if,</v>

2013
01:34:35.950 --> 01:34:39.520
<v Speaker 7>if a dudes brought up poor,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he's going to have a harder time finding</v>

2014
01:34:39.610 --> 01:34:41.380
<v Speaker 7>a mate basically.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So.</v>

2015
01:34:41.440 --> 01:34:45.820
<v Speaker 7>So it does seem like there's some</v>
<v Speaker 7>environmental influence that is somehow</v>

2016
01:34:45.821 --> 01:34:50.821
<v Speaker 7>recognized in the brain that has been</v>
<v Speaker 7>kind of selecting a little bit better</v>

2017
01:34:51.131 --> 01:34:53.650
<v Speaker 7>than chance whether you're going to have</v>
<v Speaker 7>like a male or female.</v>

2018
01:34:53.651 --> 01:34:58.010
<v Speaker 7>So there might be other mechanisms in</v>
<v Speaker 7>there like that can affect.</v>

2019
01:34:58.430 --> 01:34:59.241
<v Speaker 7>I just.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2020
01:34:59.241 --> 01:35:02.180
<v Speaker 7>I can't conceptualize how,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how it would work,</v>

2021
01:35:02.181 --> 01:35:03.140
<v Speaker 7>but that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I have,</v>

2022
01:35:03.230 --> 01:35:06.770
<v Speaker 7>I've read other studies like that and I</v>
<v Speaker 7>don't know enough about them,</v>

2023
01:35:06.780 --> 01:35:07.613
<v Speaker 7>haven't read it,</v>

2024
01:35:08.030 --> 01:35:09.750
<v Speaker 6>conceptualize why,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2025
01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:12.770
<v Speaker 6>there would be a strong connection</v>
<v Speaker 6>between that smell,</v>

2026
01:35:12.771 --> 01:35:14.480
<v Speaker 6>which was always followed by an</v>
<v Speaker 6>electrocution.</v>

2027
01:35:14.481 --> 01:35:16.760
<v Speaker 6>That it's somehow to be stored in the</v>
<v Speaker 6>DNA of the animal,</v>

2028
01:35:16.910 --> 01:35:18.500
<v Speaker 6>which would be a smart thing to pass on</v>
<v Speaker 6>to them</v>

2029
01:35:18.570 --> 01:35:19.381
<v Speaker 7>children.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

2030
01:35:19.381 --> 01:35:20.290
<v Speaker 7>would be.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2031
01:35:20.291 --> 01:35:21.124
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>

2032
01:35:21.390 --> 01:35:26.390
<v Speaker 6>Rupert sheldrake had an example about</v>
<v Speaker 6>this where he was talking about children</v>

2033
01:35:27.480 --> 01:35:31.860
<v Speaker 6>in inner cities.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're not afraid of car accidents or</v>

2034
01:35:31.920 --> 01:35:36.360
<v Speaker 6>murder or a bank.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Robbers are real real threats that</v>

2035
01:35:36.361 --> 01:35:39.300
<v Speaker 6>worried about monsters even though they</v>
<v Speaker 6>don't ever see monsters.</v>

2036
01:35:39.301 --> 01:35:43.410
<v Speaker 6>They're worried about monsters in the</v>
<v Speaker 6>closet and he correlated it to an</v>

2037
01:35:43.411 --> 01:35:48.411
<v Speaker 6>ancient fear of cats like Jaguars and</v>
<v Speaker 6>leopards and lions and things that</v>

2038
01:35:48.961 --> 01:35:53.580
<v Speaker 6>killed people forever and that at night</v>
<v Speaker 6>these things with big teeth that hide in</v>

2039
01:35:53.581 --> 01:35:58.581
<v Speaker 6>the dark and we to get you the monsters,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you know there's a video of this guy</v>

2040
01:35:59.821 --> 01:36:04.500
<v Speaker 6>where a lion or a tiger rather charges</v>
<v Speaker 6>them full clip,</v>

2041
01:36:04.501 --> 01:36:09.000
<v Speaker 6>charges them and it is as terrifying as</v>
<v Speaker 6>any harm movie you'll ever seen in your</v>

2042
01:36:09.001 --> 01:36:12.000
<v Speaker 6>life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The thing veers off about 30 or 40 yards</v>

2043
01:36:12.001 --> 01:36:14.010
<v Speaker 6>away from him and decided not to run at</v>
<v Speaker 6>him,</v>

2044
01:36:14.340 --> 01:36:19.010
<v Speaker 6>but it's running at him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Full clip with this insane speed that I</v>

2045
01:36:19.020 --> 01:36:21.360
<v Speaker 6>kind of knew the Tigers could run that</v>
<v Speaker 6>fast,</v>

2046
01:36:21.660 --> 01:36:23.790
<v Speaker 6>but until you see it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you go,</v>

2047
01:36:23.910 --> 01:36:26.340
<v Speaker 6>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're so fast.</v>

2048
01:36:26.410 --> 01:36:31.410
<v Speaker 6>It's just this furious snarl and just</v>
<v Speaker 6>unbelievable pace as it moves towards</v>

2049
01:36:33.841 --> 01:36:36.240
<v Speaker 6>him and it's monster.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2050
01:36:36.241 --> 01:36:38.970
<v Speaker 6>and if you saw that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if that killed one of your friends and</v>

2051
01:36:38.971 --> 01:36:42.570
<v Speaker 6>you have children that would be passed</v>
<v Speaker 6>onto their kids,</v>

2052
01:36:42.571 --> 01:36:44.520
<v Speaker 6>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>be scared of monsters.</v>

2053
01:36:44.940 --> 01:36:45.860
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

2054
01:36:45.990 --> 01:36:49.320
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well sometimes some people take Iowasca</v>

2055
01:36:49.321 --> 01:36:54.270
<v Speaker 7>they report seeing like snakes or worms</v>
<v Speaker 7>as well.</v>

2056
01:36:54.570 --> 01:36:55.920
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>jaguars too.</v>

2057
01:36:55.980 --> 01:36:59.430
<v Speaker 7>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I think that there's a physiological</v>

2058
01:36:59.431 --> 01:37:03.540
<v Speaker 7>reaction where your body's being</v>
<v Speaker 7>thinking that has been poisoned,</v>

2059
01:37:03.541 --> 01:37:05.910
<v Speaker 7>which it kind of has been in a little</v>
<v Speaker 7>bit of a way.</v>

2060
01:37:06.300 --> 01:37:09.630
<v Speaker 7>And I think that maybe in the</v>
<v Speaker 7>nonconscious there's,</v>

2061
01:37:10.020 --> 01:37:15.020
<v Speaker 7>there's this a projection of,</v>
<v Speaker 7>because I'm in your ancestral past,</v>

2062
01:37:17.041 --> 01:37:19.860
<v Speaker 7>if you're a poisoned,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it was probably because of a snake or</v>

2063
01:37:19.861 --> 01:37:22.170
<v Speaker 7>some parasite or bacteria or something</v>
<v Speaker 7>like that.</v>

2064
01:37:22.171 --> 01:37:25.920
<v Speaker 7>So maybe maybe that because that is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like you said,</v>

2065
01:37:25.921 --> 01:37:28.440
<v Speaker 7>maybe stored in the DNA or in the memory</v>
<v Speaker 7>somehow.</v>

2066
01:37:28.441 --> 01:37:32.880
<v Speaker 7>Even if you've never ran into a snake,</v>
<v Speaker 7>perhaps you would hallucinate one.</v>

2067
01:37:32.881 --> 01:37:36.060
<v Speaker 7>If your body thinks that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you've been poisoned being like what</v>

2068
01:37:36.061 --> 01:37:40.350
<v Speaker 7>happened here and kind of running</v>
<v Speaker 7>through a simulation of what must have</v>

2069
01:37:40.351 --> 01:37:42.450
<v Speaker 7>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That certainly could be possible.</v>

2070
01:37:42.451 --> 01:37:43.560
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's a lot of variables.</v>

2071
01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:45.820
<v Speaker 7>I don't think it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's Zinnia</v>

2072
01:37:46.100 --> 01:37:50.030
<v Speaker 6>clear way at this time to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 6>what the hell's going on or you know,</v>

2073
01:37:50.050 --> 01:37:52.240
<v Speaker 6>like people that interpret dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2074
01:37:52.280 --> 01:37:54.500
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well that means is you don't know what</v>

2075
01:37:54.501 --> 01:37:55.010
<v Speaker 6>the fuck.</v>

2076
01:37:55.010 --> 01:37:55.650
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2077
01:37:55.650 --> 01:37:59.460
<v Speaker 3>I had a dream that I was running from</v>
<v Speaker 3>Godzilla on a skateboard with my cousin</v>

2078
01:37:59.461 --> 01:38:01.180
<v Speaker 3>who I haven't seen in 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think that's.</v>

2079
01:38:01.470 --> 01:38:02.790
<v Speaker 3>You can interpret that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2080
01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:03.900
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

2081
01:38:03.900 --> 01:38:04.200
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2082
01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:06.000
<v Speaker 3>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're troubled by your past.</v>

2083
01:38:06.220 --> 01:38:10.110
<v Speaker 3>You and your cousin have this tension</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the last time you saw them,</v>

2084
01:38:10.111 --> 01:38:13.950
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you saw lizard and maybe or maybe the</v>

2085
01:38:13.951 --> 01:38:15.960
<v Speaker 3>human imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just bizarre.</v>

2086
01:38:16.010 --> 01:38:17.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very,</v>

2087
01:38:17.371 --> 01:38:20.400
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very strange and incredibly powerful.</v>

2088
01:38:20.401 --> 01:38:24.670
<v Speaker 3>I mean the idea that we can dream and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>can have a dream where,</v>

2089
01:38:25.100 --> 01:38:29.460
<v Speaker 3>where I'm making up all of these people</v>
<v Speaker 3>or people that I know in doing perfect</v>

2090
01:38:29.461 --> 01:38:34.461
<v Speaker 3>impressions of them in maybe different</v>
<v Speaker 3>languages that you don't normally know</v>

2091
01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:38.340
<v Speaker 3>and you do it all without even realizing</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're doing it.</v>

2092
01:38:38.341 --> 01:38:41.700
<v Speaker 3>You think it's happening to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't even realize you're making up</v>

2093
01:38:41.701 --> 01:38:46.690
<v Speaker 3>the story line and writing the script</v>
<v Speaker 3>and putting together the actors and we</v>

2094
01:38:46.691 --> 01:38:50.040
<v Speaker 3>are doing it in your sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you wake up well rested.</v>

2095
01:38:50.070 --> 01:38:52.410
<v Speaker 3>If you sit and like read a book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll get tired,</v>

2096
01:38:53.110 --> 01:38:55.500
<v Speaker 3>you'll get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll get fatigued using your brain</v>

2097
01:38:55.501 --> 01:38:57.930
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but your brain can do all of that in</v>

2098
01:38:57.931 --> 01:39:01.200
<v Speaker 3>your sleep and you wake up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well rested like it took.</v>

2099
01:39:01.230 --> 01:39:03.360
<v Speaker 3>It took no energy at all for the brain</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do that.</v>

2100
01:39:03.510 --> 01:39:04.950
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's got to be drugs,</v>

2101
01:39:04.951 --> 01:39:07.320
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's gotTa have something to do</v>

2102
01:39:07.321 --> 01:39:09.690
<v Speaker 3>with dmt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't know for sure,</v>

2103
01:39:09.691 --> 01:39:12.390
<v Speaker 3>but they do believe that one year in</v>
<v Speaker 3>heavy rem sleep,</v>

2104
01:39:12.391 --> 01:39:16.050
<v Speaker 3>your brain is producing all this dmt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now that they know now the con would</v>

2105
01:39:16.051 --> 01:39:19.920
<v Speaker 3>research foundation has done those</v>
<v Speaker 3>studies on rats where they've proven</v>

2106
01:39:19.921 --> 01:39:23.820
<v Speaker 3>that live rats are producing</v>
<v Speaker 3>dimethyltryptamine and the pineal gland.</v>

2107
01:39:23.850 --> 01:39:25.830
<v Speaker 3>They know that this is actually the</v>
<v Speaker 3>source of it.</v>

2108
01:39:25.890 --> 01:39:28.020
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like the first time before it was</v>

2109
01:39:28.021 --> 01:39:32.100
<v Speaker 3>all just anecdotal evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now that they know that it's totally</v>

2110
01:39:32.101 --> 01:39:35.850
<v Speaker 3>possible that wants testing measures get</v>
<v Speaker 3>better and they can figure out how to</v>

2111
01:39:35.851 --> 01:39:40.170
<v Speaker 3>detect things at a more accurate rate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are eventually going to do studies</v>

2112
01:39:40.171 --> 01:39:42.870
<v Speaker 3>on people that are asleep and they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be able to measure your dmt</v>

2113
01:39:42.871 --> 01:39:46.440
<v Speaker 3>levels and where it's coming from and</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it spikes and if they can somehow</v>

2114
01:39:46.441 --> 01:39:47.340
<v Speaker 3>or another,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2115
01:39:47.370 --> 01:39:52.370
<v Speaker 3>they're starting to be able to do things</v>
<v Speaker 3>now where they can show you images and</v>

2116
01:39:52.861 --> 01:39:56.250
<v Speaker 3>you can receive those images in your</v>
<v Speaker 3>visual cortex.</v>

2117
01:39:57.100 --> 01:40:00.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That I have to think that eventually</v>

2118
01:40:01.140 --> 01:40:06.140
<v Speaker 3>they're going to be able to interpret</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever kind of dreamed data is going</v>

2119
01:40:07.381 --> 01:40:10.230
<v Speaker 3>on in your head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least in some sort of crude form.</v>

2120
01:40:10.231 --> 01:40:14.520
<v Speaker 3>Dvr your dreams kind of eventually get</v>
<v Speaker 3>better and if we live a thousand years</v>

2121
01:40:14.521 --> 01:40:15.360
<v Speaker 3>from now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2122
01:40:15.361 --> 01:40:17.100
<v Speaker 3>who knows what he's shown me here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie.</v>

2123
01:40:17.360 --> 01:40:18.290
<v Speaker 3>I was looking something up</v>

2124
01:40:18.300 --> 01:40:21.450
<v Speaker 1>that I remember someone came in here and</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking to us about this is called</v>

2125
01:40:21.451 --> 01:40:24.390
<v Speaker 1>dreams fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an APP that people were supposed to</v>

2126
01:40:24.391 --> 01:40:27.750
<v Speaker 1>download and type in what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the dreams they just had an APP is</v>

2127
01:40:27.900 --> 01:40:29.400
<v Speaker 1>getting what it's called,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like big data.</v>

2128
01:40:29.430 --> 01:40:33.450
<v Speaker 1>It's getting all the information on what</v>
<v Speaker 1>metrics people are dreaming about</v>

2129
01:40:33.451 --> 01:40:34.270
<v Speaker 1>colors.</v>

2130
01:40:34.270 --> 01:40:36.130
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they showed you the people around</v>

2131
01:40:36.131 --> 01:40:36.964
<v Speaker 3>you who are dreaming.</v>

2132
01:40:37.160 --> 01:40:38.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is like 2 million people have</v>

2133
01:40:38.901 --> 01:40:41.510
<v Speaker 1>downloaded this and you can find out</v>
<v Speaker 1>what other people are dreaming about.</v>

2134
01:40:41.530 --> 01:40:45.650
<v Speaker 1>Kind of like based on a map.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the person that was in here</v>

2135
01:40:45.651 --> 01:40:47.540
<v Speaker 1>that was talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said that they're finding out people</v>

2136
01:40:47.541 --> 01:40:50.720
<v Speaker 1>are dreaming about the same things at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same time as all over the world or</v>

2137
01:40:51.080 --> 01:40:52.520
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who said that.</v>

2138
01:40:52.580 --> 01:40:54.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't because he said</v>

2139
01:40:54.070 --> 01:40:55.650
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't official data.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

2140
01:40:56.530 --> 01:40:58.120
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember exactly.</v>

2141
01:40:59.050 --> 01:41:01.480
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if it's everybody dreaming about</v>
<v Speaker 3>having sexual.</v>

2142
01:41:01.510 --> 01:41:03.670
<v Speaker 3>Hillary realized like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

2143
01:41:03.671 --> 01:41:05.860
<v Speaker 3>it's an epidemic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we realized she put it out there</v>

2144
01:41:06.030 --> 01:41:08.260
<v Speaker 3>from chem trails.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She spray it in the sky.</v>

2145
01:41:08.610 --> 01:41:12.800
<v Speaker 7>It's interesting that they have the um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2146
01:41:12.980 --> 01:41:15.800
<v Speaker 7>people,</v>
<v Speaker 7>people that can't talk or whatever.</v>

2147
01:41:16.040 --> 01:41:21.040
<v Speaker 7>I'm all like Stephen Hawking.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Basically you can show.</v>

2148
01:41:21.890 --> 01:41:24.530
<v Speaker 7>You can now show them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You can give them Mris.</v>

2149
01:41:24.620 --> 01:41:28.580
<v Speaker 7>Show them pictures of,</v>
<v Speaker 7>of certain words,</v>

2150
01:41:28.620 --> 01:41:29.960
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that are useful,</v>

2151
01:41:29.961 --> 01:41:34.961
<v Speaker 7>like bathroom or whatever it might be.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then it can determine what part of</v>

2152
01:41:35.271 --> 01:41:40.271
<v Speaker 7>the brain is lighting up when they are</v>
<v Speaker 7>thinking of a bathroom and then on the</v>

2153
01:41:40.720 --> 01:41:44.780
<v Speaker 7>and then you can hook them up and you</v>
<v Speaker 7>can just concentrate on the word</v>

2154
01:41:44.781 --> 01:41:48.740
<v Speaker 7>bathroom and then it will know that</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're saying bathroom.</v>

2155
01:41:48.950 --> 01:41:50.360
<v Speaker 7>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and so,</v>

2156
01:41:50.510 --> 01:41:54.710
<v Speaker 7>so this is Stephen hawkings just like</v>
<v Speaker 7>hates using new technology and shit.</v>

2157
01:41:54.711 --> 01:41:56.630
<v Speaker 7>So I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's why the.</v>

2158
01:41:56.631 --> 01:41:57.500
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he hates it.</v>

2159
01:41:57.610 --> 01:41:59.960
<v Speaker 7>Hates Tech.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's why his voice is still like the</v>

2160
01:41:59.961 --> 01:42:02.960
<v Speaker 7>fucking shittier than my gps.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He likes old computers.</v>

2161
01:42:03.020 --> 01:42:05.650
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He just doesn't like learning the new</v>

2162
01:42:05.660 --> 01:42:08.990
<v Speaker 7>technology stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's like what gets them around and</v>

2163
01:42:08.991 --> 01:42:10.400
<v Speaker 7>talks for him and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's like,</v>

2164
01:42:10.401 --> 01:42:12.050
<v Speaker 7>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>who needs that new shit?</v>

2165
01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:13.490
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

2166
01:42:13.640 --> 01:42:14.473
<v Speaker 7>but,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2167
01:42:14.750 --> 01:42:17.180
<v Speaker 7>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so once we can map the brain and figure</v>

2168
01:42:17.181 --> 01:42:19.010
<v Speaker 7>out.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But I mean,</v>

2169
01:42:19.070 --> 01:42:21.500
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's the dream to Dvr,</v>

2170
01:42:21.501 --> 01:42:26.501
<v Speaker 7>like dreams or do a dmt trip or</v>
<v Speaker 7>something like that and then slow it</v>

2171
01:42:26.991 --> 01:42:31.040
<v Speaker 7>down because it's a dmt trip.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's just a billion things happening</v>

2172
01:42:31.041 --> 01:42:33.020
<v Speaker 7>all at once and it's impossible to</v>
<v Speaker 7>articulate.</v>

2173
01:42:33.050 --> 01:42:35.120
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you're ever going to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>able to slow it down because I think we</v>

2174
01:42:35.121 --> 01:42:38.750
<v Speaker 3>look at it in terms of what we would see</v>
<v Speaker 3>in normal reality,</v>

2175
01:42:38.780 --> 01:42:41.030
<v Speaker 3>like if you had a scene that you could</v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

2176
01:42:41.031 --> 01:42:46.031
<v Speaker 3>when you know a you were 15,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you hit a home run and a little league</v>

2177
01:42:46.250 --> 01:42:48.520
<v Speaker 3>game and you remember it so clearly</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he was the.</v>

2178
01:42:48.530 --> 01:42:49.850
<v Speaker 3>You were the hero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You came back.</v>

2179
01:42:49.851 --> 01:42:53.480
<v Speaker 3>Everybody carried you on your shoulders.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you could go back and replay that</v>

2180
01:42:53.481 --> 01:42:55.430
<v Speaker 3>over and over again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you had a recording of it in your</v>

2181
01:42:55.431 --> 01:42:58.240
<v Speaker 3>mind and you can go back and see in real</v>
<v Speaker 3>time and replay it,</v>

2182
01:42:58.280 --> 01:43:00.650
<v Speaker 3>it would all make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd see the grass moving in the</v>

2183
01:43:00.651 --> 01:43:03.560
<v Speaker 3>breeze.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would see the clouds floating gently</v>

2184
01:43:03.561 --> 01:43:05.820
<v Speaker 3>overhead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd see the players in the field.</v>

2185
01:43:05.840 --> 01:43:08.120
<v Speaker 3>You see people talking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>laughing in the stands.</v>

2186
01:43:08.360 --> 01:43:13.360
<v Speaker 3>It would all make sense because it's all</v>
<v Speaker 3>references and things that exist in this</v>

2187
01:43:14.090 --> 01:43:17.510
<v Speaker 3>dimension and this plane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem with DMT is if you took even</v>

2188
01:43:17.511 --> 01:43:21.200
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>100th of the images that you're seeing,</v>

2189
01:43:21.201 --> 01:43:25.640
<v Speaker 3>just a little corner of it and just</v>
<v Speaker 3>looked at it and tried to examine what</v>

2190
01:43:25.641 --> 01:43:28.730
<v Speaker 3>the fuck it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's constantly changing geometric</v>

2191
01:43:28.731 --> 01:43:30.970
<v Speaker 3>pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's somehow and intelligent don't like</v>

2192
01:43:30.980 --> 01:43:34.580
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So to zoom in and it has some things</v>

2193
01:43:34.581 --> 01:43:38.380
<v Speaker 3>have an effect on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like have you ever done dmt to a egos?</v>

2194
01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:40.820
<v Speaker 3>Those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a South American songs that they can</v>

2195
01:43:40.821 --> 01:43:41.480
<v Speaker 3>play?</v>

2196
01:43:41.480 --> 01:43:42.620
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

2197
01:43:42.621 --> 01:43:43.320
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I do.</v>

2198
01:43:43.320 --> 01:43:45.320
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>although I did,</v>

2199
01:43:45.350 --> 01:43:48.390
<v Speaker 7>I think he was,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the Shaman was doing them on my couple</v>

2200
01:43:48.391 --> 01:43:52.310
<v Speaker 7>of Iowasca ceremony singing,</v>

2201
01:43:52.540 --> 01:43:56.260
<v Speaker 4>but I asked her didn't really take for</v>
<v Speaker 4>me it was a bit of a disappointment or</v>

2202
01:43:56.270 --> 01:43:58.030
<v Speaker 4>did you go to a bad place?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2203
01:43:58.040 --> 01:44:00.710
<v Speaker 4>I just didn't have enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm strong enough.</v>

2204
01:44:00.740 --> 01:44:03.770
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I told them my mom and I was like,</v>

2205
01:44:03.771 --> 01:44:05.210
<v Speaker 4>I do lots of DMT.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm ready.</v>

2206
01:44:05.211 --> 01:44:07.070
<v Speaker 4>I just want to like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking get there,</v>

2207
01:44:07.071 --> 01:44:09.440
<v Speaker 4>let's go for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then it wasn't enough.</v>

2208
01:44:09.441 --> 01:44:11.030
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was like a good mushroom trip.</v>

2209
01:44:11.510 --> 01:44:13.040
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it was good,</v>

2210
01:44:13.041 --> 01:44:14.040
<v Speaker 4>but it wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2211
01:44:14.070 --> 01:44:17.030
<v Speaker 4>it was enjoyable other than like sitting</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a room,</v>

2212
01:44:17.031 --> 01:44:19.180
<v Speaker 4>listen to other people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>throw up guy,</v>

2213
01:44:19.630 --> 01:44:22.910
<v Speaker 4>I just don't have the stomach for that</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it was also like,</v>

2214
01:44:23.480 --> 01:44:24.820
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was</v>

2215
01:44:26.570 --> 01:44:29.510
<v Speaker 4>my bullshit detector was just kind of</v>
<v Speaker 4>going off a lot.</v>

2216
01:44:29.511 --> 01:44:34.190
<v Speaker 4>There's just a lot of people dressed in</v>
<v Speaker 4>white move things.</v>

2217
01:44:34.520 --> 01:44:37.280
<v Speaker 4>I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2218
01:44:37.281 --> 01:44:39.640
<v Speaker 4>there's a girl had a magic wand and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>thought</v>

2219
01:44:41.510 --> 01:44:44.720
<v Speaker 4>she was so hot to eyes like to sell hot.</v>

2220
01:44:44.760 --> 01:44:47.480
<v Speaker 4>No one's ever called your bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2221
01:44:47.481 --> 01:44:47.991
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

2222
01:44:47.991 --> 01:44:49.590
<v Speaker 4>The personnel would be banging it right</v>
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>

2223
01:44:49.620 --> 01:44:53.060
<v Speaker 4>Would wouldn't be on the spot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like a dude.</v>

2224
01:44:53.061 --> 01:44:57.440
<v Speaker 4>It never be able to fucking carrier out</v>
<v Speaker 4>a magic wand without some lady being</v>

2225
01:44:57.441 --> 01:44:58.550
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's up with that?</v>

2226
01:44:58.580 --> 01:45:01.100
<v Speaker 4>You're could Kanye West have a line of</v>
<v Speaker 4>magic ones?</v>

2227
01:45:01.101 --> 01:45:01.831
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 4>It was the whole.</v>

2231
01:45:08.070 --> 01:45:10.370
<v Speaker 4>I was trying to be as open minded as</v>
<v Speaker 4>possible,</v>

2232
01:45:10.371 --> 01:45:15.371
<v Speaker 4>but it was also like the Shaman going</v>
<v Speaker 4>around and like blowing smoke on the</v>

2233
01:45:15.531 --> 01:45:17.750
<v Speaker 4>crown of my head was like a bit much for</v>
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>

2234
01:45:17.751 --> 01:45:18.351
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

<v Speaker 6>I know the smoke</v>

2238
01:45:27.440 --> 01:45:31.410
<v Speaker 4>and then I didn't like that you had to</v>
<v Speaker 4>like go and kneel in front of them to do</v>

<v Speaker 4>giving someone Iowasca I wouldn't be</v>
<v Speaker 4>bowing to them for being brave enough to</v>

2250

2260
01:46:18.710 --> 01:46:23.710
<v Speaker 6>what you're experiencing is so beyond</v>
<v Speaker 6>the reality that we all know that all</v>

<v Speaker 6>the other silly shit almost seems okay.</v>

2265
01:46:38.750 --> 01:46:40.400

2269
01:46:46.640 --> 01:46:48.050
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they say to set an intention and</v>

2270
01:46:48.051 --> 01:46:49.680
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I set an intention.</v>

2271
01:46:49.681 --> 01:46:54.250
<v Speaker 4>I was like I want to understand why I</v>
<v Speaker 4>have some self esteem issues and why I</v>

2272
01:46:54.300 --> 01:46:57.760
<v Speaker 4>don't have more confidence and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>

2273
01:46:57.850 --> 01:46:59.370
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2274
01:46:59.371 --> 01:47:02.520
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to be as open minded as</v>
<v Speaker 4>possible and I will say during the</v>

2275
01:47:02.521 --> 01:47:07.470
<v Speaker 4>Iowaska trip I was the most confident</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've ever felt in my entire life.</v>

2276
01:47:07.471 --> 01:47:09.900
<v Speaker 4>Like it was just a feeling like I could</v>
<v Speaker 4>do anything.</v>

2277
01:47:10.200 --> 01:47:12.000
<v Speaker 4>Unfortunately.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was all geared toward like,</v>

2278
01:47:12.120 --> 01:47:16.050
<v Speaker 4>well this is a bunch of bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I was pretty confident that it was.</v>

2279
01:47:16.350 --> 01:47:18.480
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can I just go outside and like trip by</v>

2280
01:47:18.481 --> 01:47:22.410
<v Speaker 4>myself because I feel great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just in a room of people like puking</v>

2281
01:47:22.411 --> 01:47:24.480
<v Speaker 4>and farting everywhere and like I just</v>
<v Speaker 4>can't.</v>

2282
01:47:24.750 --> 01:47:29.750
<v Speaker 4>It's not for me this thing and Boeing</v>
<v Speaker 4>magic wands and um,</v>

2283
01:47:29.910 --> 01:47:31.500
<v Speaker 4>and I also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have,</v>

2284
01:47:32.760 --> 01:47:33.580
<v Speaker 4>I have a couple things.</v>

2285
01:47:33.580 --> 01:47:36.870
<v Speaker 4>I think some people are misrepresenting</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's happening.</v>

2286
01:47:36.900 --> 01:47:40.300
<v Speaker 4>I think that I think that when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2287
01:47:40.380 --> 01:47:43.460
<v Speaker 4>as,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as someone who's almost died like</v>

2288
01:47:43.500 --> 01:47:47.040
<v Speaker 4>probably 20 times in my life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've had like a near death experience</v>

2289
01:47:47.041 --> 01:47:51.570
<v Speaker 4>and like breaking my feet kind of</v>
<v Speaker 4>triggered the same sort of response and</v>

2290
01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:56.040
<v Speaker 4>your life flashes before your eyes and</v>
<v Speaker 4>goes kind of back in time a little bit.</v>

2291
01:47:56.250 --> 01:47:59.400
<v Speaker 4>Really that's underselling what the</v>
<v Speaker 4>brain does because it also projects all</v>

2292
01:47:59.420 --> 01:48:02.610
<v Speaker 4>these options going forward of like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do I call an ambulance right now?</v>

2293
01:48:02.611 --> 01:48:03.444
<v Speaker 4>Do I cut it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2294
01:48:03.930 --> 01:48:06.300
<v Speaker 4>Am I going to be able to make it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's my life going to be like?</v>

2295
01:48:06.310 --> 01:48:08.010
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>

2296
01:48:08.430 --> 01:48:11.190
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I think that one,</v>

2297
01:48:11.191 --> 01:48:13.950
<v Speaker 4>when your life flashes before your eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not like some,</v>

2298
01:48:14.370 --> 01:48:17.160
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's just have a quick fond in this</v>

2299
01:48:17.170 --> 01:48:20.190
<v Speaker 4>stall.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jic Run through what our life was and</v>

2300
01:48:20.191 --> 01:48:21.360
<v Speaker 4>visit some old memories.</v>

2301
01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:24.930
<v Speaker 4>This is your brain going like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do we have anything for this situation?</v>

2302
01:48:24.931 --> 01:48:28.260
<v Speaker 4>Do we have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have we seen a TV show that will get us</v>

2303
01:48:28.261 --> 01:48:31.440
<v Speaker 4>out of this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do we do we remember first aid class and</v>

2304
01:48:31.441 --> 01:48:34.830
<v Speaker 4>it's going back and back and back and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm wondering if it's going back far</v>

2305
01:48:34.831 --> 01:48:38.580
<v Speaker 4>enough to what the fetal environment was</v>
<v Speaker 4>like.</v>

2306
01:48:38.581 --> 01:48:42.180
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if we do have memories</v>
<v Speaker 4>somewhere stored in it and because the</v>

2307
01:48:42.181 --> 01:48:46.320
<v Speaker 4>fetal environment could have easily been</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of these weird structures in cities</v>

2308
01:48:46.321 --> 01:48:48.300
<v Speaker 4>and fractal like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it,</v>

2309
01:48:48.530 --> 01:48:52.020
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't seem that odd to me that</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what the environment before you</v>

2310
01:48:52.021 --> 01:48:55.480
<v Speaker 4>came out of the womb could look like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if it's taking you back,</v>

2311
01:48:56.060 --> 01:48:57.690
<v Speaker 4>do you mean before you came out of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>womb?</v>

2312
01:48:57.691 --> 01:49:01.290
<v Speaker 4>You mean like what you were experiencing</v>
<v Speaker 4>while you're in your mother's womb?</v>

2313
01:49:01.291 --> 01:49:04.170
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>With your eyes closed and the little</v>

2314
01:49:04.171 --> 01:49:06.480
<v Speaker 4>bits of consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you think the first little bits of</v>

2315
01:49:06.481 --> 01:49:07.680
<v Speaker 4>conscious might be tripping?</v>

2316
01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:09.031
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2317
01:49:09.031 --> 01:49:11.970
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like these kind of fractal structures.</v>

2318
01:49:11.971 --> 01:49:15.000
<v Speaker 4>I think fractals are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean fractals,</v>

2319
01:49:15.001 --> 01:49:19.380
<v Speaker 4>you're able to put a finite it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're able to fit infinity into a</v>

2320
01:49:19.381 --> 01:49:21.780
<v Speaker 4>finite space somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the weird.</v>

2321
01:49:22.270 --> 01:49:26.100
<v Speaker 4>I'm a counterintuitive thing about</v>
<v Speaker 4>fractals,</v>

2322
01:49:26.101 --> 01:49:30.150
<v Speaker 4>but if you were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you made packets of information that</v>

2323
01:49:30.151 --> 01:49:33.090
<v Speaker 4>were fracked alike,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that would be a great way to transport</v>

2324
01:49:33.330 --> 01:49:36.540
<v Speaker 4>information or like transport ideas I</v>
<v Speaker 4>think.</v>

2325
01:49:36.541 --> 01:49:41.010
<v Speaker 4>And so I think that could be the very</v>
<v Speaker 4>origins of consciousness and then when</v>

2326
01:49:41.011 --> 01:49:44.430
<v Speaker 4>we came out we were seeing this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was all like a blob you didn't</v>

2327
01:49:44.431 --> 01:49:47.070
<v Speaker 4>see like walls or pictures or like you</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't,</v>

2328
01:49:47.580 --> 01:49:48.040
<v Speaker 4>so it</v>

2329
01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:52.690
<v Speaker 7>was just a blob of information coming at</v>
<v Speaker 7>you that you later had to be taught or</v>

2330
01:49:52.691 --> 01:49:54.550
<v Speaker 7>decipher and,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and,</v>

2331
01:49:54.610 --> 01:49:57.480
<v Speaker 7>but I think the origins of it could have</v>
<v Speaker 7>been like um,</v>

2332
01:49:57.640 --> 01:50:00.250
<v Speaker 7>these,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like I've seen a lot of holographic</v>

2333
01:50:00.251 --> 01:50:03.790
<v Speaker 7>cities and that kind of looked like</v>
<v Speaker 7>computer chips a little bit and that</v>

2334
01:50:03.791 --> 01:50:07.210
<v Speaker 7>sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And it wouldn't surprise me if that's</v>

2335
01:50:07.211 --> 01:50:10.600
<v Speaker 7>what the first little like say you get</v>
<v Speaker 7>this machine where you can record</v>

2336
01:50:10.601 --> 01:50:14.410
<v Speaker 7>dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If we can record then what's happening</v>

2337
01:50:14.740 --> 01:50:17.590
<v Speaker 7>when you're a fetus?</v>
<v Speaker 7>It wouldn't surprise me if it was</v>

2338
01:50:17.591 --> 01:50:21.550
<v Speaker 7>something like this and I think that I</v>
<v Speaker 7>think that um,</v>

2339
01:50:21.760 --> 01:50:26.760
<v Speaker 7>Iowaska and DMT have a way of triggering</v>
<v Speaker 7>a near death experience,</v>

2340
01:50:27.190 --> 01:50:29.230
<v Speaker 7>whether you're consciously aware of it</v>
<v Speaker 7>or not.</v>

2341
01:50:29.231 --> 01:50:31.000
<v Speaker 7>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what the fuck is happening right now?</v>

2342
01:50:31.240 --> 01:50:33.080
<v Speaker 7>Just like when,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2343
01:50:33.140 --> 01:50:37.870
<v Speaker 7>why do you think it triggers near death</v>
<v Speaker 7>experiences or it tricks your brain into</v>

2344
01:50:37.871 --> 01:50:39.220
<v Speaker 7>thinking maybe you're dying.</v>

2345
01:50:40.310 --> 01:50:44.040
<v Speaker 6>I've never had that experience on dmt.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Never had the experience where if it</v>

2346
01:50:44.060 --> 01:50:49.060
<v Speaker 6>made me feel like maybe I was dying,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it had made me feel like maybe I went</v>

2347
01:50:49.101 --> 01:50:51.040
<v Speaker 6>somewhere where I wasn't supposed to be.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2348
01:50:51.110 --> 01:50:52.820
<v Speaker 6>Like all my God,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you fucked up now.</v>

2349
01:50:52.821 --> 01:50:54.950
<v Speaker 6>You went to a place where you're not</v>
<v Speaker 6>even supposed to see this yet.</v>

2350
01:50:55.310 --> 01:51:00.080
<v Speaker 7>I haven't necessarily felt it that much</v>
<v Speaker 7>myself either other than I felt like I,</v>

2351
01:51:00.320 --> 01:51:02.720
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've forgotten that I'm a human that</v>

2352
01:51:02.780 --> 01:51:04.790
<v Speaker 7>smoke dmt.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm just like a different thing</v>

2353
01:51:04.791 --> 01:51:05.710
<v Speaker 7>entirely.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But I</v>

2354
01:51:06.010 --> 01:51:08.120
<v Speaker 6>just a little bit though,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for people that are like these fucking</v>

2355
01:51:08.121 --> 01:51:09.290
<v Speaker 6>hippies,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what are the yapping about?</v>

2356
01:51:09.820 --> 01:51:13.520
<v Speaker 6>The brain does produce endogenous</v>
<v Speaker 6>psychedelic chemicals.</v>

2357
01:51:13.580 --> 01:51:18.380
<v Speaker 6>It produces five methoxy DMT,</v>
<v Speaker 6>produces and dimethyltryptamine to super</v>

2358
01:51:18.381 --> 01:51:21.710
<v Speaker 6>potent psychedelic drugs the brain</v>
<v Speaker 6>produces and we don't understand why</v>

2359
01:51:22.010 --> 01:51:24.980
<v Speaker 6>it's entirely possible that if the adult</v>
<v Speaker 6>human brain produces it,</v>

2360
01:51:24.981 --> 01:51:26.660
<v Speaker 6>that a baby's brain producers at as</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

2361
01:51:27.020 --> 01:51:31.730
<v Speaker 6>so if it's in that womb state,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is in a lot of ways sort of like a</v>

2362
01:51:31.731 --> 01:51:35.360
<v Speaker 6>sensory deprivation tank,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but with of course the feeling and the</v>

2363
01:51:35.361 --> 01:51:38.670
<v Speaker 6>cortisol effect of the mother and the</v>
<v Speaker 6>oxytocin and all the,</v>

2364
01:51:39.110 --> 01:51:43.160
<v Speaker 6>all the different hormones and</v>
<v Speaker 6>responding directly to the stress of the</v>

2365
01:51:43.161 --> 01:51:45.680
<v Speaker 6>mother.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot going on with the body</v>

2366
01:51:45.830 --> 01:51:49.700
<v Speaker 6>inside the body,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but we should assume that those brains</v>

2367
01:51:49.701 --> 01:51:53.060
<v Speaker 6>are experiencing what we know to be</v>
<v Speaker 6>possible in the human mind,</v>

2368
01:51:53.090 --> 01:51:54.440
<v Speaker 6>which is psychedelic chemicals.</v>

2369
01:51:54.510 --> 01:51:58.680
<v Speaker 7>And I've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've seen actual dreams on DMT trips</v>

2370
01:51:58.740 --> 01:52:02.100
<v Speaker 7>like a regular dream like you're used to</v>
<v Speaker 7>having,</v>

2371
01:52:02.101 --> 01:52:05.340
<v Speaker 7>which is unusual because that's nothing</v>
<v Speaker 7>what the normal dmt world.</v>

2372
01:52:05.400 --> 01:52:06.360
<v Speaker 7>See me look while you're talking</v>

2373
01:52:06.490 --> 01:52:08.070
<v Speaker 6>dmt or while you're dreaming.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because I've,</v>

2374
01:52:08.090 --> 01:52:11.070
<v Speaker 6>I've had dreams where you go into the</v>
<v Speaker 6>DMT world.</v>

2375
01:52:11.830 --> 01:52:13.820
<v Speaker 7>I've experienced both.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

2376
01:52:13.850 --> 01:52:18.010
<v Speaker 7>but I've had,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've smoked dmt and then I'd see like a,</v>

2377
01:52:18.320 --> 01:52:23.320
<v Speaker 7>a guy like walking down a hall holding a</v>
<v Speaker 7>box and then I'd look at them and he'd</v>

2378
01:52:23.801 --> 01:52:26.080
<v Speaker 7>look at me and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

2379
01:52:26.270 --> 01:52:28.800
<v Speaker 7>and then start like twitching,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

2380
01:52:28.860 --> 01:52:31.010
<v Speaker 7>like there was a glitch in the metrics</v>
<v Speaker 7>and he's like,</v>

2381
01:52:31.050 --> 01:52:32.090
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

2382
01:52:32.180 --> 01:52:33.860
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like making fun of me.</v>

2383
01:52:34.410 --> 01:52:37.100
<v Speaker 7>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and then he just reached back and</v>

2384
01:52:37.101 --> 01:52:41.330
<v Speaker 7>grabbed the wall and pull it and it</v>
<v Speaker 7>would be like this veil that.</v>

2385
01:52:41.331 --> 01:52:45.110
<v Speaker 7>Then it became the whole world and</v>
<v Speaker 7>started like the DMT space.</v>

2386
01:52:45.500 --> 01:52:46.333
<v Speaker 7>You're more familiar.</v>

2387
01:52:46.390 --> 01:52:49.180
<v Speaker 3>Have you could sell that in a virtual</v>
<v Speaker 3>reality environment.</v>

2388
01:52:49.181 --> 01:52:51.130
<v Speaker 3>Like here's the game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You wake up,</v>

2389
01:52:51.131 --> 01:52:52.540
<v Speaker 3>you're in a classroom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you will,</v>

2390
01:52:52.541 --> 01:52:53.650
<v Speaker 3>you like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you lift your head up.</v>

2391
01:52:53.651 --> 01:52:53.891
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2392
01:52:53.891 --> 01:52:56.110
<v Speaker 3>I must have fallen asleep in class.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And everybody left me here.</v>

2393
01:52:56.490 --> 01:52:58.930
<v Speaker 3>You go out in the hallway and there's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy walking down the hallway and he's</v>

2394
01:52:58.931 --> 01:53:00.760
<v Speaker 3>carrying a box of books and you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>excuse me,</v>

2395
01:53:00.970 --> 01:53:02.500
<v Speaker 3>excuse me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you go up to him and he grab his</v>

2396
01:53:02.501 --> 01:53:03.760
<v Speaker 3>shoulder and he turns and looks at me</v>
<v Speaker 3>and goes,</v>

2397
01:53:04.510 --> 01:53:06.790
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be.</v>

2398
01:53:07.850 --> 01:53:09.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's inevitable though.</v>

2399
01:53:09.400 --> 01:53:12.250
<v Speaker 3>They're going to be able to figure out a</v>
<v Speaker 3>way to create a virtual.</v>

2400
01:53:12.330 --> 01:53:15.130
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the acts of the things that</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually Mckenna believed that they were</v>

2401
01:53:15.131 --> 01:53:18.640
<v Speaker 3>going to be able to figure out how to</v>
<v Speaker 3>create a virtual dmt world,</v>

2402
01:53:18.910 --> 01:53:22.570
<v Speaker 3>which would give people the dmt</v>
<v Speaker 3>experience without actually taking dmt</v>

2403
01:53:22.780 --> 01:53:25.960
<v Speaker 3>is that your brain was somehow or</v>
<v Speaker 3>another synchronize with this virtual</v>

2404
01:53:25.961 --> 01:53:29.020
<v Speaker 3>world and you would have a full blown</v>
<v Speaker 3>dmt trip with.</v>

2405
01:53:29.290 --> 01:53:31.300
<v Speaker 3>And this is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He thought this up.</v>

2406
01:53:31.600 --> 01:53:34.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure he was tripping,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he thought this up,</v>

2407
01:53:34.130 --> 01:53:36.670
<v Speaker 3>like I believe the nineties or maybe</v>
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>

2408
01:53:36.671 --> 01:53:39.790
<v Speaker 3>He might might've even been the eighties</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was talking about this is when</v>

2409
01:53:39.820 --> 01:53:44.350
<v Speaker 3>virtual reality was still like people</v>
<v Speaker 3>had predicted it's,</v>

2410
01:53:44.770 --> 01:53:47.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that virtual reality was going to blow</v>

2411
01:53:47.171 --> 01:53:50.620
<v Speaker 3>up and going to be huge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it took a long time until recently</v>

2412
01:53:50.621 --> 01:53:52.720
<v Speaker 3>where the technology caught up to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>concept.</v>

2413
01:53:52.830 --> 01:53:53.530
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2414
01:53:53.530 --> 01:53:56.050
<v Speaker 7>Like they finally are starting to get</v>
<v Speaker 7>that hoverboard.</v>

2415
01:53:57.170 --> 01:53:59.150
<v Speaker 3>The Lexus one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that the one you mean?</v>

2416
01:53:59.470 --> 01:54:00.290
<v Speaker 3>The one with the</v>

2417
01:54:00.290 --> 01:54:03.070
<v Speaker 7>error?</v>
<v Speaker 7>The same guy that made the pack,</v>

2418
01:54:03.071 --> 01:54:06.520
<v Speaker 7>that goes in water and then shoots the</v>
<v Speaker 7>air he made.</v>

2419
01:54:06.730 --> 01:54:11.730
<v Speaker 7>He made a board that you stand on that</v>
<v Speaker 7>uses fans and he hovers like 30,</v>

2420
01:54:13.550 --> 01:54:16.570
<v Speaker 7>40 feet above the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Have you seen that video?</v>

2421
01:54:16.600 --> 01:54:17.750
<v Speaker 7>No.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2422
01:54:17.760 --> 01:54:18.480
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>

2423
01:54:18.480 --> 01:54:23.340
<v Speaker 3>Talking about the Orioles Hoverboard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which uses magnets somehow it's got like</v>

2424
01:54:23.341 --> 01:54:27.240
<v Speaker 3>some super cooled magnets with liquid</v>
<v Speaker 3>nitrogen or something like that I</v>

2425
01:54:27.241 --> 01:54:30.480
<v Speaker 3>believe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the Lexus one is really cool because</v>

2426
01:54:31.280 --> 01:54:35.340
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of a proof of concept.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what they're doing right now is</v>

2427
01:54:35.341 --> 01:54:38.980
<v Speaker 3>they're using it and the guy stands on</v>
<v Speaker 3>it like a skateboard and he,</v>

2428
01:54:39.060 --> 01:54:42.660
<v Speaker 3>he sort of slides around on things and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's only a couple inches off the</v>

2429
01:54:42.661 --> 01:54:44.460
<v Speaker 3>ground,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's clearly floating like you're</v>

2430
01:54:44.480 --> 01:54:46.590
<v Speaker 3>here now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is another one.</v>

2431
01:54:46.620 --> 01:54:49.080
<v Speaker 3>This is the other one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is another one called Arco Board.</v>

2432
01:54:49.350 --> 01:54:50.820
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so this one's all fans.</v>

2433
01:54:51.520 --> 01:54:53.850
<v Speaker 3>This isn't the one that I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it might not be real.</v>

2434
01:54:53.851 --> 01:54:56.430
<v Speaker 3>This looks fake as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This looks like a sitcom actor.</v>

2435
01:54:56.790 --> 01:54:59.340
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well it was that real.</v>

2436
01:54:59.590 --> 01:55:01.880
<v Speaker 8>So,</v>
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

2437
01:55:03.370 --> 01:55:06.550
<v Speaker 3>I could run fast and that I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 3>impressed on find the lexis one.</v>

2438
01:55:06.580 --> 01:55:07.870
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is pretty dope though.</v>

2439
01:55:08.790 --> 01:55:09.660
<v Speaker 3>So is this real?</v>

2440
01:55:11.320 --> 01:55:13.700
<v Speaker 8>I don't believe that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Oh Wow.</v>

2441
01:55:13.720 --> 01:55:15.380
<v Speaker 3>A bunch of fans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2442
01:55:16.090 --> 01:55:19.780
<v Speaker 3>So if you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you just put flyboard air test one,</v>

2443
01:55:19.990 --> 01:55:22.190
<v Speaker 3>try to go to the lexus thing first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to.</v>

2444
01:55:22.270 --> 01:55:24.430
<v Speaker 3>I want to show you this lexus thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I haven't seen this,</v>

2445
01:55:25.210 --> 01:55:28.030
<v Speaker 3>this is Alexis ones on magnets and</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

2446
01:55:28.060 --> 01:55:30.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's super cooled magnets with some sort</v>

2447
01:55:30.641 --> 01:55:32.380
<v Speaker 3>of liquid nitrogen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at that.</v>

2448
01:55:32.381 --> 01:55:34.900
<v Speaker 3>See how it's so all that air that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>coming out of the bottom.</v>

2449
01:55:35.140 --> 01:55:39.430
<v Speaker 3>That's the liquid nitrogen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think lexus is assuming that this</v>

2450
01:55:39.431 --> 01:55:44.310
<v Speaker 3>technology sort of like back to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>futures shit that this technology</v>

2451
01:55:44.310 --> 01:55:46.500
<v Speaker 2>is eventually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How are we going to get around with cars</v>

2452
01:55:47.010 --> 01:55:48.720
<v Speaker 2>and one of the interesting things about</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2453
01:55:48.721 --> 01:55:50.670
<v Speaker 2>if they really do figure out how to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

2454
01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:55.350
<v Speaker 2>if we get around in cars that are not</v>
<v Speaker 2>connected to the ground with wheels,</v>

2455
01:55:55.410 --> 01:55:58.680
<v Speaker 2>even though there will be momentum as we</v>
<v Speaker 2>collide with each other,</v>

2456
01:55:58.681 --> 01:56:00.930
<v Speaker 2>if we fuck up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it won't have nearly the same kind of</v>

2457
01:56:00.931 --> 01:56:04.680
<v Speaker 2>impact because you won't have the</v>
<v Speaker 2>friction of the row that makes the</v>

2458
01:56:04.681 --> 01:56:07.230
<v Speaker 2>vehicle absorb the energy of the other</v>
<v Speaker 2>vehicle.</v>

2459
01:56:07.820 --> 01:56:09.990
<v Speaker 2>It'll absorb it a little bit and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>bounce you back.</v>

2460
01:56:10.560 --> 01:56:11.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2461
01:56:11.160 --> 01:56:14.840
<v Speaker 2>Well with having.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eventually our power lines will be super</v>

2462
01:56:14.841 --> 01:56:18.150
<v Speaker 2>conductors to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're cooled down enough so you're</v>

2463
01:56:18.151 --> 01:56:21.930
<v Speaker 2>not losing all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're losing something like a quarter</v>

2464
01:56:21.931 --> 01:56:25.230
<v Speaker 2>of the energy is just lost in the wires</v>
<v Speaker 2>and transit.</v>

2465
01:56:25.370 --> 01:56:26.203
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2466
01:56:26.850 --> 01:56:29.400
<v Speaker 2>so I had to find the flyboard.</v>

2467
01:56:29.410 --> 01:56:32.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm flyboard air test.</v>

2468
01:56:32.161 --> 01:56:34.860
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy's flying.</v>

2469
01:56:35.070 --> 01:56:35.701
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2470
01:56:35.701 --> 01:56:37.710
<v Speaker 2>This is way cooler than that other piece</v>
<v Speaker 2>of shit</v>

2471
01:56:39.290 --> 01:56:41.400
<v Speaker 2>quit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is nuts.</v>

2472
01:56:41.430 --> 01:56:44.850
<v Speaker 2>How long can this guy stay on this thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>for like five or 10 minutes or something</v>

2473
01:56:44.851 --> 01:56:48.510
<v Speaker 2>like that in Wa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Watch him stick this landing to it's,</v>

2474
01:56:48.600 --> 01:56:51.160
<v Speaker 2>it's incredible how much control he has</v>
<v Speaker 2>over it.</v>

2475
01:56:51.300 --> 01:56:52.770
<v Speaker 2>This is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

2476
01:56:52.771 --> 01:56:54.540
<v Speaker 2>is this available for public</v>
<v Speaker 2>consumption?</v>

2477
01:56:54.600 --> 01:56:56.100
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this is.</v>

2478
01:56:56.450 --> 01:56:59.010
<v Speaker 2>I think it will be a representative of</v>
<v Speaker 2>this company.</v>

2479
01:56:59.680 --> 01:57:03.690
<v Speaker 2>Employee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope to be at will happily represent</v>

2480
01:57:03.720 --> 01:57:05.760
<v Speaker 2>the hover board company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to.</v>

2481
01:57:05.761 --> 01:57:09.060
<v Speaker 2>I want to be associated with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at the crazy wind is coming from it</v>

2482
01:57:09.061 --> 01:57:11.940
<v Speaker 2>and that other frame you could see like</v>
<v Speaker 2>when there's a dark background,</v>

2483
01:57:11.941 --> 01:57:14.910
<v Speaker 2>you could see the force of the air below</v>
<v Speaker 2>it back up a little bit.</v>

2484
01:57:14.911 --> 01:57:16.710
<v Speaker 2>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She could see the force of the air below</v>

2485
01:57:16.711 --> 01:57:17.544
<v Speaker 2>that thing.</v>

2486
01:57:18.450 --> 01:57:19.440
<v Speaker 2>See if you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2487
01:57:19.441 --> 01:57:21.570
<v Speaker 2>look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See that force like backup a little bit</v>

2488
01:57:21.571 --> 01:57:23.730
<v Speaker 2>so he could see it like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look as he's flying,</v>

2489
01:57:24.030 --> 01:57:26.850
<v Speaker 2>how much air that thing must be pumping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>

2490
01:57:27.360 --> 01:57:31.000
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's fucking up the water underneath</v>

2491
01:57:31.001 --> 01:57:33.180
<v Speaker 2>him as he's swimming around or is flying</v>
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>

2492
01:57:33.200 --> 01:57:35.430
<v Speaker 2>Whether that's incredible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2493
01:57:35.550 --> 01:57:37.920
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've watched the landing here.</v>

2494
01:57:38.700 --> 01:57:43.110
<v Speaker 2>Look at how accurate this is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2495
01:57:43.510 --> 01:57:46.950
<v Speaker 2>That's like a five by five space that he</v>
<v Speaker 2>just landed dead center.</v>

2496
01:57:47.160 --> 01:57:49.680
<v Speaker 2>And he landed right next to two guys</v>
<v Speaker 2>that were so confident.</v>

2497
01:57:49.681 --> 01:57:54.120
<v Speaker 2>They just stood there while he's flying</v>
<v Speaker 2>around on what it looks like.</v>

2498
01:57:54.190 --> 01:57:56.280
<v Speaker 2>It's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a box.</v>

2499
01:57:56.450 --> 01:57:58.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't even look like a skateboard.</v>

2500
01:57:58.411 --> 01:58:01.620
<v Speaker 2>It looks like a circular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a small trampoline.</v>

2501
01:58:01.680 --> 01:58:03.410
<v Speaker 2>It's so small.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2502
01:58:04.020 --> 01:58:06.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mission one coming soon.</v>

2503
01:58:06.840 --> 01:58:08.510
<v Speaker 2>Flyboard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2504
01:58:08.730 --> 01:58:10.110
<v Speaker 2>what is the data on this video?</v>

2505
01:58:10.110 --> 01:58:12.750
<v Speaker 2>Jamie is like a year ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe</v>

2506
01:58:14.430 --> 01:58:15.840
<v Speaker 2>April of this year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2507
01:58:16.260 --> 01:58:18.720
<v Speaker 2>it's just a matter of time before</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone has one of those in.</v>

2508
01:58:18.721 --> 01:58:19.860
<v Speaker 2>They're flying right in front of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>window,</v>

2509
01:58:19.861 --> 01:58:22.980
<v Speaker 2>jerking off on your house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent going to happen,</v>

2510
01:58:23.820 --> 01:58:25.560
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone's going to be the first guy.</v>

2511
01:58:25.590 --> 01:58:27.620
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're shooting down drones.</v>

2512
01:58:27.630 --> 01:58:30.870
<v Speaker 2>Someone's going to shoot one of those</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's going to go to Britney Spears</v>

2513
01:58:30.870 --> 01:58:33.120
<v Speaker 2>House and walk off on her roof and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to get arrested.</v>

2514
01:58:33.480 --> 01:58:37.170
<v Speaker 2>And it'll be like the new thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like planking was a thing for awhile.</v>

2515
01:58:38.340 --> 01:58:42.220
<v Speaker 2>Jerking off Hubbard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eric's famous people's be a new thing.</v>

2516
01:58:42.880 --> 01:58:44.830
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're going to not be able to control</v>

2517
01:58:44.831 --> 01:58:46.420
<v Speaker 6>the skies.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's sorta like the ocean.</v>

2518
01:58:46.490 --> 01:58:50.200
<v Speaker 6>I think the ocean is fascinating for</v>
<v Speaker 6>friends who have friends that have</v>

2519
01:58:50.560 --> 01:58:51.460
<v Speaker 6>boats,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2520
01:58:51.461 --> 01:58:55.060
<v Speaker 6>the guys liked to go fishing and I've</v>
<v Speaker 6>never had a boat,</v>

2521
01:58:55.240 --> 01:58:57.530
<v Speaker 6>but one of the things that I've always</v>
<v Speaker 6>thought was incredible.</v>

2522
01:58:57.531 --> 01:59:00.820
<v Speaker 6>It was like if you live like Siri,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Marina del Rey or something like that</v>

2523
01:59:00.821 --> 01:59:02.830
<v Speaker 6>and you have a boat and you hop out and</v>
<v Speaker 6>your boat,</v>

2524
01:59:02.860 --> 01:59:04.960
<v Speaker 6>you go out into another world,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're,</v>

2525
01:59:05.290 --> 01:59:09.370
<v Speaker 6>you're a fucking space traveler on a</v>
<v Speaker 6>boat and you're roaming around this</v>

2526
01:59:09.371 --> 01:59:14.371
<v Speaker 6>enormous swath of ocean and you're free</v>
<v Speaker 6>to go left and right and up and down,</v>

2527
01:59:15.100 --> 01:59:17.410
<v Speaker 6>and there's no roads and there's no</v>
<v Speaker 6>restrictions.</v>

2528
01:59:17.620 --> 01:59:18.453
<v Speaker 6>You can do whatever you want.</v>

2529
01:59:18.640 --> 01:59:20.690
<v Speaker 7>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I can't believe like people are so I,</v>

2530
01:59:20.691 --> 01:59:23.230
<v Speaker 7>I mean I think space travel is exciting</v>
<v Speaker 7>and everything,</v>

2531
01:59:23.231 --> 01:59:26.050
<v Speaker 7>but everyone's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what if we found aliens?</v>

2532
01:59:26.051 --> 01:59:29.980
<v Speaker 7>There's like there's aliens,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're in the ocean and it's cheap to</v>

2533
01:59:29.981 --> 01:59:32.800
<v Speaker 7>get to them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Just go to every time we go down deeper,</v>

2534
01:59:32.860 --> 01:59:36.670
<v Speaker 7>we've discovered all these new worlds</v>
<v Speaker 7>down there and they're constantly</v>

2535
01:59:36.720 --> 01:59:40.110
<v Speaker 6>finding crazy new life forms.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wonder if like what would the number</v>

2536
01:59:40.111 --> 01:59:43.740
<v Speaker 6>or the percentage of documented life</v>
<v Speaker 6>forms in the ocean are because they're</v>

2537
01:59:43.741 --> 01:59:48.540
<v Speaker 6>always finding new freaky variations.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Did you ever see that m squared that</v>

2538
01:59:48.541 --> 01:59:51.020
<v Speaker 6>they found that has crab legs?</v>
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

2539
01:59:51.270 --> 01:59:52.550
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's crazy man.</v>

2540
01:59:52.551 --> 01:59:56.190
<v Speaker 6>It's a giant squid that they found in</v>
<v Speaker 6>Mexico and it was a camera that was</v>

2541
01:59:56.191 --> 02:00:01.191
<v Speaker 6>attached to one of those oil rigs,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so they were essentially just checking</v>

2542
02:00:01.741 --> 02:00:04.620
<v Speaker 6>the oil rig and there was this thing</v>
<v Speaker 6>that was floating right next to the</v>

2543
02:00:04.700 --> 02:00:09.700
<v Speaker 6>which is really freaky looking alien</v>
<v Speaker 6>squid that has like crab legs,</v>

2544
02:00:12.240 --> 02:00:15.480
<v Speaker 6>like really bizarre,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like obvious bends to the legs.</v>

2545
02:00:15.481 --> 02:00:16.230
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>check this out,</v>

2546
02:00:16.230 --> 02:00:18.840
<v Speaker 6>look at this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>look at that fucking thing man.</v>

2547
02:00:19.940 --> 02:00:24.000
<v Speaker 6>Like look how long it's tentacles are.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's enormous.</v>

2548
02:00:24.001 --> 02:00:27.000
<v Speaker 6>This is 2007.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Was the name of this video?</v>

2549
02:00:27.001 --> 02:00:27.960
<v Speaker 6>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so people could</v>

2550
02:00:29.980 --> 02:00:34.120
<v Speaker 7>alien like squid filmed in oil drilling</v>
<v Speaker 7>site is this one I picked,</v>

2551
02:00:34.121 --> 02:00:38.620
<v Speaker 7>but that's exactly what I would call it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Video courtesy of the Shell oil company</v>

2552
02:00:38.650 --> 02:00:41.710
<v Speaker 7>Shell doing a good job at finding aliens</v>
<v Speaker 7>in the ocean.</v>

2553
02:00:42.070 --> 02:00:44.140
<v Speaker 7>There's like that blue planet or</v>
<v Speaker 7>something.</v>

2554
02:00:44.160 --> 02:00:46.720
<v Speaker 7>One of those BBC documentaries like</v>
<v Speaker 7>planet earth,</v>

2555
02:00:46.721 --> 02:00:50.850
<v Speaker 7>but just ocean stuff and you watch it</v>
<v Speaker 7>and it's like you could show people and</v>

2556
02:00:50.851 --> 02:00:55.570
<v Speaker 7>they and they would think that you're</v>
<v Speaker 7>watching like Cgi made up thing like</v>

2557
02:00:55.571 --> 02:00:57.610
<v Speaker 7>about aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like have you ever seen anything like</v>

2558
02:00:57.611 --> 02:00:59.180
<v Speaker 7>this before?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

2559
02:00:59.210 --> 02:01:00.970
<v Speaker 7>that back it up.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So you can see that,</v>

2560
02:01:00.971 --> 02:01:03.430
<v Speaker 7>that image again with articulating bent</v>
<v Speaker 7>arms,</v>

2561
02:01:03.431 --> 02:01:05.230
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what the fuck is that man?</v>

2562
02:01:05.530 --> 02:01:06.790
<v Speaker 7>Just look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you,</v>

2563
02:01:07.030 --> 02:01:09.820
<v Speaker 7>if you saw that thing floating in space,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

2564
02:01:09.821 --> 02:01:11.980
<v Speaker 7>If they were already.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

2565
02:01:12.040 --> 02:01:14.770
<v Speaker 7>if they were on their way to the moon</v>
<v Speaker 7>and they saw that thing floating in</v>

2566
02:01:14.771 --> 02:01:15.320
<v Speaker 7>space,</v>

2567
02:01:15.320 --> 02:01:16.220
<v Speaker 6>go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whoa.</v>

2568
02:01:17.250 --> 02:01:20.180
<v Speaker 6>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's an alien in space that's</v>

2569
02:01:20.181 --> 02:01:22.490
<v Speaker 6>watching over the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Found that too.</v>

2570
02:01:22.491 --> 02:01:24.950
<v Speaker 6>They're very intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They can solve puzzles.</v>

2571
02:01:25.460 --> 02:01:27.080
<v Speaker 6>We would,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we would think that is the most</v>

2572
02:01:27.081 --> 02:01:29.510
<v Speaker 6>incredible discovery ever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But we see this thing in the ocean like,</v>

2573
02:01:29.540 --> 02:01:30.470
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's just here.</v>

2574
02:01:30.660 --> 02:01:34.100
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It depends on where you put things,</v>

2575
02:01:34.101 --> 02:01:36.410
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like if you put anything is more</v>

2576
02:01:36.411 --> 02:01:39.080
<v Speaker 6>interesting as you put it in space.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There was an orange,</v>

2577
02:01:39.290 --> 02:01:41.450
<v Speaker 6>we found an orange on the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God.</v>

2578
02:01:41.530 --> 02:01:44.740
<v Speaker 7>And there's like that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like I was talking about how your brain</v>

2579
02:01:44.770 --> 02:01:48.880
<v Speaker 7>perceives things as metaphors,</v>
<v Speaker 7>everything that's like getting high is</v>

2580
02:01:48.881 --> 02:01:53.710
<v Speaker 7>good or you're feeling like up or rather</v>
<v Speaker 7>than down as bad,</v>

2581
02:01:53.711 --> 02:01:56.890
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and held under the Earth and heavens up</v>

2582
02:01:56.891 --> 02:01:58.630
<v Speaker 7>in the clouds and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's something,</v>

2583
02:01:58.870 --> 02:02:03.760
<v Speaker 7>I don't know if it's just this natural</v>
<v Speaker 7>like are inherent fight against gravity</v>

2584
02:02:04.090 --> 02:02:09.090
<v Speaker 7>that makes us think like that's what you</v>
<v Speaker 7>want to pain to lift off to be up there.</v>

2585
02:02:10.290 --> 02:02:13.270
<v Speaker 7>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Hell is definitely because of volcanoes.</v>

2586
02:02:13.650 --> 02:02:15.520
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it only makes sense.</v>

2587
02:02:15.580 --> 02:02:16.413
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

2588
02:02:16.760 --> 02:02:17.340
<v Speaker 7>it makes sense.</v>

2589
02:02:17.340 --> 02:02:18.990
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>have you ever been near a volcano</v>

2590
02:02:18.991 --> 02:02:20.040
<v Speaker 6>before?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

2591
02:02:20.041 --> 02:02:22.560
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The Big island has awesome tours.</v>

2592
02:02:22.590 --> 02:02:25.860
<v Speaker 6>You could hop in a helicopter,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you fly over the big island of Hawaii</v>

2593
02:02:26.070 --> 02:02:30.240
<v Speaker 6>and you could actually watch the island</v>
<v Speaker 6>grow because the island grows something</v>

2594
02:02:30.241 --> 02:02:31.740
<v Speaker 6>like a foot a day or something like</v>
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>

2595
02:02:31.920 --> 02:02:35.040
<v Speaker 6>Like you can literally see the lava come</v>
<v Speaker 6>out of the,</v>

2596
02:02:35.190 --> 02:02:39.000
<v Speaker 6>out of the chutes and go into the ocean</v>
<v Speaker 6>and create new land.</v>

2597
02:02:39.160 --> 02:02:41.490
<v Speaker 6>And that's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fucking awesome.</v>

2598
02:02:41.840 --> 02:02:45.000
<v Speaker 6>And you're flying over this helicopter,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the helicopter rather.</v>

2599
02:02:45.060 --> 02:02:49.320
<v Speaker 6>You're flying over this volcano and you</v>
<v Speaker 6>look down into lava,</v>

2600
02:02:49.530 --> 02:02:54.530
<v Speaker 6>you see the very center of the earth</v>
<v Speaker 6>oozing out of it's out of this weird</v>

2601
02:02:54.991 --> 02:02:57.870
<v Speaker 6>surface which has created the entire</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hawaiian island chain by the way,</v>

2602
02:02:57.930 --> 02:03:00.480
<v Speaker 6>the entire Hawaiian island chain.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's just volcanoes.</v>

2603
02:03:00.690 --> 02:03:02.880
<v Speaker 6>That's all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Volcanoes in the middle of the ocean</v>

2604
02:03:03.120 --> 02:03:06.900
<v Speaker 6>that erupted millions of years ago and</v>
<v Speaker 6>poke their way through the top and</v>

2605
02:03:06.901 --> 02:03:08.730
<v Speaker 6>there's constantly growing and changing</v>

2606
02:03:09.610 --> 02:03:14.050
<v Speaker 7>reality is far more interesting than</v>
<v Speaker 7>what humans were able to make up in</v>

2607
02:03:14.051 --> 02:03:16.600
<v Speaker 7>their wildest fantasies of trying to</v>
<v Speaker 7>explain it.</v>

2608
02:03:16.620 --> 02:03:17.850
<v Speaker 6>What was happening?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2609
02:03:17.851 --> 02:03:21.570
<v Speaker 6>once we get a grip on reality or we get</v>
<v Speaker 6>a good account of reality,</v>

2610
02:03:21.571 --> 02:03:23.880
<v Speaker 6>then you can get pretty creative with</v>
<v Speaker 6>your imagination.</v>

2611
02:03:24.170 --> 02:03:25.080
<v Speaker 6>But the.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2612
02:03:25.081 --> 02:03:30.000
<v Speaker 6>the this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the actual reality of space is insane.</v>

2613
02:03:30.180 --> 02:03:34.470
<v Speaker 6>The idea that there's hundreds of</v>
<v Speaker 6>billions of galaxies out there and that</v>

2614
02:03:34.500 --> 02:03:38.790
<v Speaker 6>each one of them has an infinite</v>
<v Speaker 6>possibilities about what kind of planets</v>

2615
02:03:38.791 --> 02:03:40.980
<v Speaker 6>around there,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how far they are from their stars.</v>

2616
02:03:41.190 --> 02:03:45.330
<v Speaker 6>How many stars are in the solar system,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what else is out there in terms of life?</v>

2617
02:03:45.630 --> 02:03:48.330
<v Speaker 6>What are the possibilities of things</v>
<v Speaker 6>surviving out there?</v>

2618
02:03:48.331 --> 02:03:51.780
<v Speaker 6>They think it's possible that some</v>
<v Speaker 6>living things could maybe even survive</v>

2619
02:03:51.781 --> 02:03:53.940
<v Speaker 6>in space,</v>
<v Speaker 6>detached from a planet,</v>

2620
02:03:54.270 --> 02:03:55.240
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2621
02:03:55.280 --> 02:03:57.330
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>even the reality of evolution,</v>

2622
02:03:57.331 --> 02:03:58.164
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

2623
02:03:59.040 --> 02:04:01.830
<v Speaker 7>I mean when you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>when you get far enough into it and you</v>

2624
02:04:01.831 --> 02:04:05.790
<v Speaker 7>look at all these different examples,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's the reality of evolution is</v>

2625
02:04:06.060 --> 02:04:10.080
<v Speaker 7>actually crazier than like there was a</v>
<v Speaker 7>god and he had a son named Jesus.</v>

2626
02:04:10.280 --> 02:04:12.990
<v Speaker 7>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's also more accurate.</v>

2627
02:04:13.260 --> 02:04:15.140
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I,</v>

2628
02:04:15.270 --> 02:04:18.780
<v Speaker 7>I remember I used to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how could anyone believe it?</v>

2629
02:04:18.890 --> 02:04:21.810
<v Speaker 7>I was very angry.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I raised a strictly Catholic,</v>

2630
02:04:21.811 --> 02:04:24.000
<v Speaker 7>so I had some bitterness about all of</v>
<v Speaker 7>that.</v>

2631
02:04:24.420 --> 02:04:27.090
<v Speaker 7>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but then once I started learning more</v>

2632
02:04:27.091 --> 02:04:29.850
<v Speaker 7>about evolution and it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

2633
02:04:29.851 --> 02:04:32.340
<v Speaker 7>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I didn't know half of this stuff.</v>

2634
02:04:32.610 --> 02:04:34.810
<v Speaker 7>It's no wonder these people,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2635
02:04:35.460 --> 02:04:37.530
<v Speaker 7>no one's been given the opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 7>learn it,</v>

2636
02:04:37.680 --> 02:04:39.660
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and when you're brought up in a small</v>

2637
02:04:39.661 --> 02:04:41.910
<v Speaker 7>town and that's just your upbringing,</v>
<v Speaker 7>never.</v>

2638
02:04:42.880 --> 02:04:43.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2639
02:04:44.590 --> 02:04:47.560
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just stop and think about the big bang.</v>

2640
02:04:48.310 --> 02:04:49.870
<v Speaker 3>If you want a mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck yourself.</v>

2641
02:04:50.200 --> 02:04:53.260
<v Speaker 3>Think about the idea that these</v>
<v Speaker 3>scientists are proposing that the</v>

2642
02:04:53.261 --> 02:04:55.330
<v Speaker 3>universe itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything that you say,</v>

2643
02:04:55.331 --> 02:04:59.080
<v Speaker 3>it was smaller than the head of a pin</v>
<v Speaker 3>and had infinite mass and somehow or</v>

2644
02:04:59.081 --> 02:05:01.690
<v Speaker 3>another exploded and created everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've seen the stars today.</v>

2645
02:05:03.270 --> 02:05:07.720
<v Speaker 3>What are you sure</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's under debate?</v>

2646
02:05:07.780 --> 02:05:08.980
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's other proposals.</v>

2647
02:05:09.010 --> 02:05:11.210
<v Speaker 3>There's other scientific,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2648
02:05:11.230 --> 02:05:14.140
<v Speaker 3>ideas that have been bandied about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>parallel universes,</v>

2649
02:05:14.350 --> 02:05:16.540
<v Speaker 3>brains,</v>
<v Speaker 3>membranes colliding,</v>

2650
02:05:16.800 --> 02:05:17.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2651
02:05:17.330 --> 02:05:20.470
<v Speaker 3>there's different universities in</v>
<v Speaker 3>dimensions or like just slightly</v>

2652
02:05:20.471 --> 02:05:25.360
<v Speaker 3>separated from each other and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>collide the endless process of expansion</v>

2653
02:05:25.361 --> 02:05:28.810
<v Speaker 3>and contraction and that that's what</v>
<v Speaker 3>happens at the entire universe.</v>

2654
02:05:28.811 --> 02:05:33.190
<v Speaker 3>Expands infinitely and then pulls back</v>
<v Speaker 3>into an infinitely small spot and then</v>

2655
02:05:33.191 --> 02:05:33.611
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2656
02:05:33.611 --> 02:05:36.910
<v Speaker 3>every x amount of billion years just</v>
<v Speaker 3>repeats the cycle.</v>

2657
02:05:37.250 --> 02:05:37.851
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

2658
02:05:37.851 --> 02:05:39.080
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think that our,</v>

2659
02:05:39.200 --> 02:05:43.130
<v Speaker 7>I think that our brains are endlessly</v>
<v Speaker 7>fascinating to just that.</v>

2660
02:05:43.190 --> 02:05:45.890
<v Speaker 7>I mean humans like to give themselves a</v>
<v Speaker 7>lot of credit,</v>

2661
02:05:46.310 --> 02:05:50.180
<v Speaker 7>but I think that we have like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like kind of like the movie inside out.</v>

2662
02:05:50.181 --> 02:05:55.181
<v Speaker 7>I think we have vast universes inside of</v>
<v Speaker 7>our head that seem all expensive.</v>

2663
02:05:55.281 --> 02:05:56.370
<v Speaker 7>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>because I,</v>

2664
02:05:56.490 --> 02:06:01.490
<v Speaker 7>I think that dreams and hallucinating</v>
<v Speaker 7>are coming from within sight,</v>

2665
02:06:02.720 --> 02:06:05.000
<v Speaker 7>from inside the mind.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't believe that you're connecting</v>

2666
02:06:05.001 --> 02:06:06.800
<v Speaker 7>with different dimensions and stuff like</v>
<v Speaker 7>that,</v>

2667
02:06:06.801 --> 02:06:09.080
<v Speaker 7>but it certainly looks like it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which means you have,</v>

2668
02:06:09.230 --> 02:06:10.820
<v Speaker 7>if I'm right,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a which,</v>

2669
02:06:10.821 --> 02:06:13.820
<v Speaker 7>who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 7>then it means that you have this whole</v>

2670
02:06:13.821 --> 02:06:18.080
<v Speaker 7>like multiverse set up just for running</v>
<v Speaker 7>all these different tests just for like</v>

2671
02:06:18.170 --> 02:06:23.030
<v Speaker 7>walking around and making decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's entire universes inside of your</v>

2672
02:06:23.031 --> 02:06:24.230
<v Speaker 7>head,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which</v>

2673
02:06:24.230 --> 02:06:26.150
<v Speaker 3>is totally possible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't,</v>

2674
02:06:26.151 --> 02:06:28.400
<v Speaker 3>I don't have a position.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have a position on whether or</v>

2675
02:06:28.401 --> 02:06:30.560
<v Speaker 3>not it's in my mind or whether or not</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's real.</v>

2676
02:06:31.130 --> 02:06:33.800
<v Speaker 3>And I think it's entirely possible that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need,</v>

2677
02:06:33.860 --> 02:06:38.000
<v Speaker 3>need to consider the possibility that</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything that's in your mind,</v>

2678
02:06:38.001 --> 02:06:40.550
<v Speaker 3>everything that's imaginary is actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>real.</v>

2679
02:06:40.790 --> 02:06:44.750
<v Speaker 3>Meaning that the imagination is</v>
<v Speaker 3>responsible for every single thing any</v>

2680
02:06:44.770 --> 02:06:47.030
<v Speaker 3>human has ever done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every car that's ever been built,</v>

2681
02:06:47.031 --> 02:06:50.600
<v Speaker 3>every podcasts ever been made.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every television has ever been designed.</v>

2682
02:06:50.810 --> 02:06:52.730
<v Speaker 3>All of that has come out of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>imagination.</v>

2683
02:06:52.980 --> 02:06:57.290
<v Speaker 3>The imagination is as strange force</v>
<v Speaker 3>inside of human,</v>

2684
02:06:57.291 --> 02:07:00.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>quote unquote consciousness that living,</v>

2685
02:07:00.261 --> 02:07:04.640
<v Speaker 3>physical or not living but solid</v>
<v Speaker 3>physical things come from like</v>

2686
02:07:04.641 --> 02:07:07.040
<v Speaker 3>literally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the seed of these solid physical</v>

2687
02:07:07.041 --> 02:07:09.050
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when we say that,</v>

2688
02:07:09.430 --> 02:07:13.040
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were imagining or hallucinating that</v>

2689
02:07:13.041 --> 02:07:17.800
<v Speaker 3>we're experiencing some divine entity to</v>
<v Speaker 3>comes to us from another dimension and</v>

2690
02:07:17.801 --> 02:07:19.970
<v Speaker 3>explains the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the nature of reality.</v>

2691
02:07:20.510 --> 02:07:24.020
<v Speaker 3>It's entirely possible that that is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>hallucination.</v>

2692
02:07:24.021 --> 02:07:26.240
<v Speaker 3>Meaning that physical thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't kidnap it.</v>

2693
02:07:26.241 --> 02:07:30.230
<v Speaker 3>You can't throw a net on it and bring it</v>
<v Speaker 3>back from you know the wormhole and Plop</v>

2694
02:07:30.231 --> 02:07:31.730
<v Speaker 3>it down in front of the police</v>
<v Speaker 3>department.</v>

2695
02:07:31.731 --> 02:07:32.181
<v Speaker 3>Say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2696
02:07:32.181 --> 02:07:35.830
<v Speaker 3>I found it a proof of another dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I brought something right?</v>

2697
02:07:35.960 --> 02:07:36.160
<v Speaker 3>But</v>

2698
02:07:36.160 --> 02:07:39.060
<v Speaker 6>if you went to visit with God,</v>
<v Speaker 6>say if,</v>

2699
02:07:39.061 --> 02:07:39.894
<v Speaker 6>if,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if,</v>

2700
02:07:39.940 --> 02:07:44.200
<v Speaker 6>if someone proves that there is a heaven</v>
<v Speaker 6>and that God is real and you can have a</v>

2701
02:07:44.201 --> 02:07:47.340
<v Speaker 6>brief visit with God and you go to God</v>
<v Speaker 6>and you,</v>

2702
02:07:47.341 --> 02:07:50.890
<v Speaker 6>you talked to him and in 15 minutes</v>
<v Speaker 6>explains the nature of the universe and</v>

2703
02:07:50.891 --> 02:07:53.680
<v Speaker 6>love and the concept of positive energy</v>
<v Speaker 6>and all these different things.</v>

2704
02:07:53.950 --> 02:07:56.800
<v Speaker 6>Please take this back with you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Please take this back with you and do</v>

2705
02:07:56.801 --> 02:07:58.270
<v Speaker 6>what you can to make the world a better</v>
<v Speaker 6>place.</v>

2706
02:07:58.990 --> 02:08:02.440
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you have a trip or if you actually go</v>

2707
02:08:02.441 --> 02:08:06.670
<v Speaker 6>to meet God and or if you have a trip</v>
<v Speaker 6>where you imagine you meet God,</v>

2708
02:08:06.671 --> 02:08:09.020
<v Speaker 6>the experience is exactly the same.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like we,</v>

2709
02:08:09.160 --> 02:08:12.280
<v Speaker 6>I don't think we know what's real and</v>
<v Speaker 6>what's not real.</v>

2710
02:08:12.281 --> 02:08:14.980
<v Speaker 6>I think we're super cocky and were real</v>
<v Speaker 6>nervous.</v>

2711
02:08:14.981 --> 02:08:17.950
<v Speaker 6>Like one of the reasons why we get</v>
<v Speaker 6>paranoid when we smoked pot is because</v>

2712
02:08:18.010 --> 02:08:21.640
<v Speaker 6>we start becoming aware of variables</v>
<v Speaker 6>that we might have suppressed or chosen</v>

2713
02:08:21.641 --> 02:08:24.730
<v Speaker 6>to ignore and then they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're confronted with them and all of</v>

2714
02:08:24.731 --> 02:08:28.480
<v Speaker 6>our insecurities and like a cascade tied</v>
<v Speaker 6>away sort of a situation where you can</v>

2715
02:08:28.481 --> 02:08:30.700
<v Speaker 6>handle all the data that you've been</v>
<v Speaker 6>putting aside like,</v>

2716
02:08:30.701 --> 02:08:31.534
<v Speaker 6>oh fuck</v>

2717
02:08:31.570 --> 02:08:33.370
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I smoke weed and I'm like,</v>

2718
02:08:33.460 --> 02:08:35.410
<v Speaker 7>oh my fucking to do list.</v>

2719
02:08:35.590 --> 02:08:37.600
<v Speaker 6>I think about bills that didn't pay when</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was 18.</v>

2720
02:08:38.050 --> 02:08:39.970
<v Speaker 6>Like what do I do?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to do you.</v>

2721
02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:45.000
<v Speaker 6>There's weird things that happened to</v>
<v Speaker 6>the mind and I don't know how much of</v>

2722
02:08:45.880 --> 02:08:49.780
<v Speaker 6>what we call the imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how we try to think of it as like,</v>

2723
02:08:49.810 --> 02:08:51.340
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's just imagining things,</v>

2724
02:08:51.820 --> 02:08:52.780
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

2725
02:08:52.870 --> 02:08:53.703
<v Speaker 6>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't.</v>

2726
02:08:53.750 --> 02:08:56.710
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it's entirely possible that were</v>

2727
02:08:56.711 --> 02:09:01.120
<v Speaker 6>really hung up on this word real.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like what's real and what's not real.</v>

2728
02:09:01.121 --> 02:09:03.870
<v Speaker 6>I think we're real hung up on that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Real real.</v>

2729
02:09:04.010 --> 02:09:06.580
<v Speaker 7>Our Day to day lives is dependent on</v>
<v Speaker 7>imagination.</v>

2730
02:09:06.600 --> 02:09:09.860
<v Speaker 7>We've all imagined democracy are these</v>
<v Speaker 7>laws came.</v>

2731
02:09:09.890 --> 02:09:14.450
<v Speaker 7>We're a human invention that came from</v>
<v Speaker 7>imagination that we imagine is real.</v>

2732
02:09:14.480 --> 02:09:17.360
<v Speaker 7>Even even every corporation isn't an</v>
<v Speaker 7>actual thing.</v>

2733
02:09:17.361 --> 02:09:20.390
<v Speaker 7>It's an idea that we just imagined and</v>
<v Speaker 7>we take it for granted.</v>

2734
02:09:20.391 --> 02:09:25.391
<v Speaker 7>You don't have to go like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you don't have to go like do I believe</v>

2735
02:09:26.211 --> 02:09:30.350
<v Speaker 7>in seven slash 11 or like you take it</v>
<v Speaker 7>for granted that seven slash 11 is just</v>

2736
02:09:30.351 --> 02:09:32.270
<v Speaker 7>an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's a,</v>

2737
02:09:32.330 --> 02:09:33.620
<v Speaker 7>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's a,</v>

2738
02:09:33.980 --> 02:09:38.390
<v Speaker 7>a judge could close down seven slash 11</v>
<v Speaker 7>with one of his ideas at any moment and</v>

2739
02:09:38.391 --> 02:09:41.390
<v Speaker 7>then it would no longer exist,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but the buildings are still there,</v>

2740
02:09:41.990 --> 02:09:44.300
<v Speaker 7>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>7:11 is not the building.</v>

2741
02:09:44.540 --> 02:09:46.610
<v Speaker 7>It's not the employees,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's,</v>

2742
02:09:46.970 --> 02:09:50.990
<v Speaker 7>it's just an idea,</v>
<v Speaker 7>an idea implemented in the physical form</v>

2743
02:09:50.991 --> 02:09:52.220
<v Speaker 7>that you can experience,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

2744
02:09:52.280 --> 02:09:52.650
<v Speaker 7>You can go ahead</v>

2745
02:09:52.650 --> 02:09:53.850
<v Speaker 6>touch it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can walk in the door,</v>

2746
02:09:53.851 --> 02:09:58.140
<v Speaker 6>you could smell it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I just don't know if that makes it</v>

2747
02:09:58.141 --> 02:10:01.680
<v Speaker 6>real and then everything that happens to</v>
<v Speaker 6>you in your dream is not real.</v>

2748
02:10:01.980 --> 02:10:03.300
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

2749
02:10:03.320 --> 02:10:06.030
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what really is in terms of like,</v>

2750
02:10:06.031 --> 02:10:07.470
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you want to be successful in this</v>

2751
02:10:07.471 --> 02:10:09.420
<v Speaker 6>world,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you want to be successful in this</v>

2752
02:10:09.421 --> 02:10:11.610
<v Speaker 6>material world,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you have to consider the fact that laws</v>

2753
02:10:11.611 --> 02:10:13.650
<v Speaker 6>are real.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can't drive a thousand miles an hour</v>

2754
02:10:13.651 --> 02:10:16.230
<v Speaker 6>in a 20 mile zone.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can't punch babies.</v>

2755
02:10:16.350 --> 02:10:20.160
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of real consequences for</v>
<v Speaker 6>real actions because this world has</v>

2756
02:10:20.161 --> 02:10:21.020
<v Speaker 6>rules.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

2757
02:10:21.021 --> 02:10:25.080
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But it doesn't mean that the trips that</v>

2758
02:10:25.081 --> 02:10:28.650
<v Speaker 6>you have,</v>
<v Speaker 6>these intense transcendent psychedelic</v>

2759
02:10:28.651 --> 02:10:32.010
<v Speaker 6>experiences are hallucinations.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't mean that they're not real.</v>

2760
02:10:32.430 --> 02:10:36.860
<v Speaker 6>It means we be entirely hung up on</v>
<v Speaker 6>containing our consciousness and our</v>

2761
02:10:36.861 --> 02:10:41.861
<v Speaker 6>thinking and our awareness to what we</v>
<v Speaker 6>can touch and bang on and pick up and</v>

2762
02:10:42.801 --> 02:10:43.810
<v Speaker 6>measure and the look.</v>

2763
02:10:43.820 --> 02:10:48.080
<v Speaker 6>I put it on a scale.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know it's real and these physical laws</v>

2764
02:10:48.081 --> 02:10:51.140
<v Speaker 6>that we've applied to this reality,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what we call reality,</v>

2765
02:10:51.620 --> 02:10:56.240
<v Speaker 6>don't necessarily know if that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it's entirely possible to me</v>

2766
02:10:56.390 --> 02:11:00.800
<v Speaker 6>that that might be a limiting factor on</v>
<v Speaker 6>how we perceive the universe around us</v>

2767
02:11:00.980 --> 02:11:05.210
<v Speaker 6>and that it's leftover from having to</v>
<v Speaker 6>worry about predators and hunting and</v>

2768
02:11:05.211 --> 02:11:07.010
<v Speaker 6>gathering.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And we're moving,</v>

2769
02:11:07.100 --> 02:11:09.960
<v Speaker 6>I believe slowly away from that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2770
02:11:10.140 --> 02:11:15.140
<v Speaker 6>not even slowly and I think our ability</v>
<v Speaker 6>to alter reality through virtual reality</v>

2771
02:11:16.100 --> 02:11:20.300
<v Speaker 6>and even through our understanding and</v>
<v Speaker 6>application of psychedelic drugs,</v>

2772
02:11:20.480 --> 02:11:25.480
<v Speaker 6>there's like a psychedelic technology as</v>
<v Speaker 6>well as virtual technology and all of</v>

2773
02:11:26.031 --> 02:11:31.031
<v Speaker 6>these things are giving us this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this ability to change the concept of</v>

2774
02:11:31.101 --> 02:11:31.920
<v Speaker 6>real,</v>

2775
02:11:31.920 --> 02:11:35.070
<v Speaker 7>like the realm of possibilities as we</v>
<v Speaker 7>can imagine that.</v>

2776
02:11:36.120 --> 02:11:38.760
<v Speaker 7>Because even to say that punching babies</v>
<v Speaker 7>is a bad thing,</v>

2777
02:11:38.780 --> 02:11:39.470
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>who,</v>

2778
02:11:39.470 --> 02:11:44.470
<v Speaker 7>who I'm fucking single guy and your baby</v>
<v Speaker 7>punch,</v>

2779
02:11:44.810 --> 02:11:47.310
<v Speaker 7>I um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but here,</v>

2780
02:11:47.320 --> 02:11:50.760
<v Speaker 7>here's where I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I try to be very,</v>

2781
02:11:50.761 --> 02:11:55.761
<v Speaker 7>very skeptical of my trips because I've</v>
<v Speaker 7>seen God in different universes and like</v>

2782
02:11:56.041 --> 02:11:59.130
<v Speaker 7>the whole bit and it seems like as real,</v>
<v Speaker 7>as anything I've ever experienced did</v>

2783
02:11:59.880 --> 02:12:02.940
<v Speaker 7>my,</v>
<v Speaker 7>my problem with my memory and perception</v>

2784
02:12:02.941 --> 02:12:05.940
<v Speaker 7>of it is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>is that it's just such a short amount of</v>

2785
02:12:05.941 --> 02:12:09.420
<v Speaker 7>time and it's so different and so</v>
<v Speaker 7>exciting that I think the brain,</v>

2786
02:12:09.840 --> 02:12:12.360
<v Speaker 7>I think that the brain just</v>
<v Speaker 7>automatically,</v>

2787
02:12:12.361 --> 02:12:14.550
<v Speaker 7>I think that's very salient in the</v>
<v Speaker 7>brain,</v>

2788
02:12:14.551 --> 02:12:18.630
<v Speaker 7>really attaches to this,</v>
<v Speaker 7>these new and novel new information</v>

2789
02:12:18.631 --> 02:12:21.960
<v Speaker 7>that's very exciting and it's a little</v>
<v Speaker 7>scary to your brain.</v>

2790
02:12:21.961 --> 02:12:25.710
<v Speaker 7>Remembers his scary things a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Tricker is a bit of a stress response.</v>

2791
02:12:26.250 --> 02:12:29.340
<v Speaker 7>And I think that I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I like to say that imagine instead there</v>

2792
02:12:29.341 --> 02:12:31.570
<v Speaker 7>was someone who was,</v>
<v Speaker 7>who was born on,</v>

2793
02:12:31.880 --> 02:12:33.480
<v Speaker 7>on a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2794
02:12:33.620 --> 02:12:35.970
<v Speaker 7>it was like they just have the brain</v>
<v Speaker 7>chemistry,</v>

2795
02:12:35.971 --> 02:12:40.971
<v Speaker 7>like the brains on Lsd all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then one day things are rainbow</v>

2796
02:12:41.011 --> 02:12:41.701
<v Speaker 7>colored,</v>
<v Speaker 7>whatever.</v>

2797
02:12:41.701 --> 02:12:44.340
<v Speaker 7>And that's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and then one day when I get around just</v>

2798
02:12:44.341 --> 02:12:47.190
<v Speaker 7>fine and then one day when they're 30,</v>
<v Speaker 7>someone gives them a pill that brings</v>

2799
02:12:47.191 --> 02:12:51.660
<v Speaker 7>them to our reality.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It would seem just as mind blowing and</v>

2800
02:12:51.661 --> 02:12:56.280
<v Speaker 7>just as true like I get it now there's</v>
<v Speaker 7>these things called jobs and like these</v>

2801
02:12:56.281 --> 02:13:00.090
<v Speaker 7>entry level positions and like these</v>
<v Speaker 7>hierarchies and you can,</v>

2802
02:13:00.200 --> 02:13:05.040
<v Speaker 7>if you show up on time each day you can</v>
<v Speaker 7>establish yourself in this hierarchy,</v>

2803
02:13:05.041 --> 02:13:05.970
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and then you,</v>

2804
02:13:06.690 --> 02:13:09.510
<v Speaker 7>if you went in on different days,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it would seem like a different world.</v>

2805
02:13:09.511 --> 02:13:12.900
<v Speaker 7>Like I thought I had it all figured out,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but then I was like this person that was</v>

2806
02:13:12.901 --> 02:13:16.170
<v Speaker 7>in a cube typing away.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then you think you have that figured</v>

2807
02:13:16.171 --> 02:13:18.810
<v Speaker 7>out and then you hit a casual Friday and</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're like,</v>

2808
02:13:18.811 --> 02:13:20.940
<v Speaker 7>it was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I thought they all had uniforms and then</v>

2809
02:13:20.941 --> 02:13:22.650
<v Speaker 7>they all looked different.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

2810
02:13:22.680 --> 02:13:24.870
<v Speaker 7>like this is this.</v>
<v Speaker 7>To me,</v>

2811
02:13:24.900 --> 02:13:29.900
<v Speaker 7>this perception is just as much the trip</v>
<v Speaker 7>as any psychedelic will will ever get</v>

2812
02:13:30.541 --> 02:13:31.351
<v Speaker 7>you on.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's that,</v>

2813
02:13:31.351 --> 02:13:32.040
<v Speaker 7>that's such a</v>

2814
02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:33.440
<v Speaker 6>short amount of time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>In reality,</v>

2815
02:13:33.450 --> 02:13:36.090
<v Speaker 6>it's very bizarre and we're.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're accustomed to it.</v>

2816
02:13:36.150 --> 02:13:37.930
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're just used to this.</v>

2817
02:13:39.020 --> 02:13:44.020
<v Speaker 6>It's entirely possible that your reality</v>
<v Speaker 6>is different than his reality,</v>

2818
02:13:45.390 --> 02:13:47.280
<v Speaker 6>than my reality.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then another person's reality.</v>

2819
02:13:47.281 --> 02:13:50.820
<v Speaker 6>Then what you were talking about before</v>
<v Speaker 6>being how the way you view the world and</v>

2820
02:13:50.821 --> 02:13:54.040
<v Speaker 6>how the world seems to you is more</v>
<v Speaker 6>fucked up when you're hurt you,</v>

2821
02:13:54.100 --> 02:13:55.410
<v Speaker 6>when you were,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you were injured.</v>

2822
02:13:55.500 --> 02:13:59.100
<v Speaker 6>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It might entirely be possible that when</v>

2823
02:13:59.101 --> 02:14:01.920
<v Speaker 6>you make good decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you decide to take care of your</v>

2824
02:14:01.921 --> 02:14:03.450
<v Speaker 6>body,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you started to eat healthy,</v>

2825
02:14:03.451 --> 02:14:08.451
<v Speaker 6>when you side to meditate or do yoga or</v>
<v Speaker 6>practice mindfulness or set out an</v>

2826
02:14:08.941 --> 02:14:12.600
<v Speaker 6>intention for your day and say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know today I'm not going to complain</v>

2827
02:14:12.601 --> 02:14:13.470
<v Speaker 6>about anything.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2828
02:14:13.471 --> 02:14:15.150
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to show up on time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not going to complain.</v>

2829
02:14:15.151 --> 02:14:17.100
<v Speaker 6>I'm being nice person and I'm going to</v>
<v Speaker 6>try to.</v>

2830
02:14:17.730 --> 02:14:19.470
<v Speaker 6>When I went to a negative thought comes</v>
<v Speaker 6>into my main,</v>

2831
02:14:19.620 --> 02:14:21.490
<v Speaker 6>my brain,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's going to be a mandate.</v>

2832
02:14:21.491 --> 02:14:24.360
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to do my best to push that out</v>
<v Speaker 6>and replace it with a positive thought.</v>

2833
02:14:24.810 --> 02:14:29.810
<v Speaker 6>When someone chooses to exercise like</v>
<v Speaker 6>that sort of a protocol chooses to go</v>

2834
02:14:32.401 --> 02:14:35.240
<v Speaker 6>forth with like a like a list of things</v>
<v Speaker 6>that they're going to,</v>

2835
02:14:35.460 --> 02:14:37.830
<v Speaker 6>this is how I'm going to treat life as</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to think about life and I'm</v>

2836
02:14:37.831 --> 02:14:40.160
<v Speaker 6>going to be fluid while I'm doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I'm not gonna.</v>

2837
02:14:40.180 --> 02:14:43.830
<v Speaker 6>Allow all these things that I know to be</v>
<v Speaker 6>detrimental aspects of life.</v>

2838
02:14:43.920 --> 02:14:45.750
<v Speaker 6>I'm not gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Allow those in if I can help it.</v>

2839
02:14:46.320 --> 02:14:48.180
<v Speaker 6>Just doing that changes the world.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

2840
02:14:48.240 --> 02:14:52.130
<v Speaker 6>I mean she literally changes your world</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I think it's.</v>

2841
02:14:52.260 --> 02:14:55.590
<v Speaker 6>It's entirely possible that what you're</v>
<v Speaker 6>talking about when you're saying that</v>

2842
02:14:55.620 --> 02:14:58.410
<v Speaker 6>when you're enthusiastic and you're</v>
<v Speaker 6>embracing the psychedelic experience,</v>

2843
02:14:58.411 --> 02:15:01.890
<v Speaker 6>that it's possible that your brain</v>
<v Speaker 6>creates all this new stuff,</v>

2844
02:15:01.891 --> 02:15:03.450
<v Speaker 6>but that might be the point.</v>

2845
02:15:03.900 --> 02:15:07.830
<v Speaker 6>That might be the point of all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When you have these psychedelic trips</v>

2846
02:15:07.831 --> 02:15:12.360
<v Speaker 6>and your brain on the psychedelic trips</v>
<v Speaker 6>interacts with those songs and the</v>

2847
02:15:12.361 --> 02:15:13.700
<v Speaker 6>music,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the ECO rose,</v>

2848
02:15:13.701 --> 02:15:15.420
<v Speaker 6>what?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know you didn't have like the best</v>

2849
02:15:15.421 --> 02:15:19.200
<v Speaker 6>experience of it because you're the DMT,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which wasn't as strong in the IOWASCA,</v>

2850
02:15:19.620 --> 02:15:24.620
<v Speaker 6>but I've had experiences with the songs</v>
<v Speaker 6>where you see the experience moving to</v>

2851
02:15:25.291 --> 02:15:25.921
<v Speaker 6>the song,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

2852
02:15:25.921 --> 02:15:30.390
<v Speaker 6>if a song can alter the way,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I know there's something special</v>

2853
02:15:30.391 --> 02:15:34.530
<v Speaker 6>about sounds and music,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's some special connection between</v>

2854
02:15:34.800 --> 02:15:39.800
<v Speaker 6>creative and creative sounds that people</v>
<v Speaker 6>have put together and concocted and put</v>

2855
02:15:40.321 --> 02:15:42.360
<v Speaker 6>together in some sort of a a beautiful</v>
<v Speaker 6>song.</v>

2856
02:15:42.540 --> 02:15:45.000
<v Speaker 6>There's A.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a response that the body has to</v>

2857
02:15:45.001 --> 02:15:47.250
<v Speaker 6>those like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like if you're on a treadmill and a</v>

2858
02:15:47.251 --> 02:15:49.350
<v Speaker 6>great song comes on,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you feel like he could run faster.</v>

2859
02:15:50.340 --> 02:15:53.750
<v Speaker 6>Music contains some sort of inspiration.</v>

2860
02:15:54.450 --> 02:15:54.841
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's A.</v>

2861
02:15:54.841 --> 02:15:55.860
<v Speaker 6>There's an effect,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2862
02:15:56.130 --> 02:15:59.370
<v Speaker 6>But that effect also has an effect on</v>
<v Speaker 6>the psychedelic world when you're</v>

2863
02:15:59.371 --> 02:16:01.360
<v Speaker 6>tripping.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Those songs have an effect.</v>

2864
02:16:01.500 --> 02:16:04.860
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My thought is that your mind and your</v>

2865
02:16:04.861 --> 02:16:09.861
<v Speaker 6>attitude might not just have an effect</v>
<v Speaker 6>on experiences when you're running into</v>

2866
02:16:10.561 --> 02:16:12.630
<v Speaker 6>people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It might have an effect on the</v>

2867
02:16:12.631 --> 02:16:16.200
<v Speaker 6>psychedelic dreams might have an effect</v>
<v Speaker 6>on your future and it might not just be</v>

2868
02:16:16.201 --> 02:16:19.560
<v Speaker 6>hippy bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The thinking positive and choosing to</v>

2869
02:16:19.561 --> 02:16:23.490
<v Speaker 6>act and go forth in a positive way is</v>
<v Speaker 6>just a,</v>

2870
02:16:24.120 --> 02:16:29.120
<v Speaker 6>just like a good Karma Sorta Hippie,</v>
<v Speaker 6>nonsensical way of trying control</v>

2871
02:16:30.130 --> 02:16:32.890
<v Speaker 2>the uncontrollable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is this random world we live in</v>

2872
02:16:33.230 --> 02:16:36.910
<v Speaker 2>might not be true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just might think that because it's</v>

2873
02:16:36.911 --> 02:16:40.630
<v Speaker 2>comforting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might want to think that there's less</v>

2874
02:16:40.631 --> 02:16:42.220
<v Speaker 2>control than there actually is.</v>

2875
02:16:43.150 --> 02:16:45.080
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think that.</v>

2876
02:16:45.760 --> 02:16:47.000
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's a lot.</v>

2877
02:16:47.240 --> 02:16:48.510
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>

2878
02:16:48.710 --> 02:16:52.430
<v Speaker 7>so one way in the way in which,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

2879
02:16:52.730 --> 02:16:55.340
<v Speaker 7>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I sometimes at home I'll have a,</v>

2880
02:16:55.580 --> 02:16:58.620
<v Speaker 7>I'll have like an animal planet,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like planet earth or whatever on,</v>

2881
02:16:58.700 --> 02:17:03.700
<v Speaker 7>on mute and then I'll be playing music</v>
<v Speaker 7>and I'll have people over and people</v>

2882
02:17:04.311 --> 02:17:06.860
<v Speaker 7>think that it's because I'm playing the</v>
<v Speaker 7>music through the TV.</v>

2883
02:17:06.861 --> 02:17:09.050
<v Speaker 7>People think that they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what is this program?</v>

2884
02:17:09.051 --> 02:17:09.950
<v Speaker 7>What's this?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm like,</v>

2885
02:17:09.951 --> 02:17:12.920
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's just that it's just on mute with</v>

2886
02:17:12.921 --> 02:17:16.580
<v Speaker 7>music playing over it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But if I don't tell people that they'll</v>

2887
02:17:16.590 --> 02:17:20.300
<v Speaker 7>be watching it and if it's like a happy</v>
<v Speaker 7>go lucky song,</v>

2888
02:17:20.630 --> 02:17:21.830
<v Speaker 7>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh man,</v>

2889
02:17:21.831 --> 02:17:23.000
<v Speaker 7>these animals.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Sure.</v>

2890
02:17:23.001 --> 02:17:23.781
<v Speaker 7>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Good.</v>

2891
02:17:23.781 --> 02:17:27.590
<v Speaker 7>Don't they look at how.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Look at how relaxing that looks just</v>

2892
02:17:27.591 --> 02:17:30.530
<v Speaker 7>laid out in the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then if it's like a real intense</v>

2893
02:17:30.531 --> 02:17:31.460
<v Speaker 7>dark song,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're like,</v>

2894
02:17:31.490 --> 02:17:33.860
<v Speaker 7>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 7>are they ever going to make it?</v>

2895
02:17:33.861 --> 02:17:36.080
<v Speaker 7>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it completely changes their perception</v>

2896
02:17:36.081 --> 02:17:38.210
<v Speaker 7>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This is why we have soundtracks and</v>

2897
02:17:38.211 --> 02:17:40.270
<v Speaker 7>everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And um,</v>

2898
02:17:40.370 --> 02:17:44.690
<v Speaker 7>I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I actually think that music altering the</v>

2899
02:17:44.720 --> 02:17:49.720
<v Speaker 7>psychedelic state or world or perception</v>
<v Speaker 7>or whatever you want to say,</v>

2900
02:17:49.850 --> 02:17:53.780
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>is like I listen to this band spawn goal</v>

2901
02:17:53.790 --> 02:17:55.790
<v Speaker 7>that makes music specifically for an</v>
<v Speaker 7>emt.</v>

2902
02:17:56.240 --> 02:17:57.060
<v Speaker 7>I think that that's</v>

2903
02:17:57.060 --> 02:18:02.060
<v Speaker 2>is one of my rants really spangle song</v>
<v Speaker 2>that has this long rant where me and Jim</v>

2904
02:18:03.090 --> 02:18:03.810
<v Speaker 2>Breuer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

2905
02:18:03.810 --> 02:18:08.810
<v Speaker 2>we're so barbecued on a pot lollipops</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this was like the early two</v>

2906
02:18:10.231 --> 02:18:14.060
<v Speaker 2>thousands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some guy called in and um,</v>

2907
02:18:14.370 --> 02:18:14.970
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2908
02:18:14.970 --> 02:18:17.730
<v Speaker 2>asked us a question about something</v>
<v Speaker 2>about dmt.</v>

2909
02:18:17.731 --> 02:18:22.731
<v Speaker 2>And I went on this crazy rant about dmt</v>
<v Speaker 2>state and they put it into a song.</v>

2910
02:18:23.590 --> 02:18:24.540
<v Speaker 7>But that's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2911
02:18:24.940 --> 02:18:27.060
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I wouldn't want to hear that while I'm</v>

2912
02:18:27.061 --> 02:18:28.890
<v Speaker 7>tripping.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't like when there's words in their</v>

2913
02:18:28.891 --> 02:18:31.500
<v Speaker 7>songs.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I try to only listen to music one's way</v>

2914
02:18:31.501 --> 02:18:32.334
<v Speaker 7>to aggro</v>

2915
02:18:33.200 --> 02:18:36.140
<v Speaker 2>Tuesday astic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I was just hanging out with my</v>

2916
02:18:36.141 --> 02:18:39.650
<v Speaker 2>friend and we were just so high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're barely should be talking to</v>

2917
02:18:39.651 --> 02:18:41.330
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely not answering phone calls.</v>

2918
02:18:41.650 --> 02:18:46.540
<v Speaker 7>See to me that the fact that a different</v>
<v Speaker 7>song and I'll see like a different story</v>

2919
02:18:46.541 --> 02:18:49.690
<v Speaker 7>and it's pretty predictable.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like I'll play the song again and I know</v>

2920
02:18:49.691 --> 02:18:51.970
<v Speaker 7>I'm going to see like this purple woman</v>
<v Speaker 7>dancing around or whatever.</v>

2921
02:18:52.420 --> 02:18:56.470
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and the fact that that influences that</v>

2922
02:18:56.980 --> 02:19:00.640
<v Speaker 7>perception,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that world that you're in is more of an</v>

2923
02:19:00.641 --> 02:19:05.641
<v Speaker 7>indicator to me that it's coming from</v>
<v Speaker 7>within your head and not like</v>

2924
02:19:07.510 --> 02:19:10.480
<v Speaker 7>transporting you to a different</v>
<v Speaker 7>dimension or making you perceive a</v>

2925
02:19:10.481 --> 02:19:13.720
<v Speaker 7>different dimension because why?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Why would it influence that dimension?</v>

2926
02:19:13.721 --> 02:19:16.330
<v Speaker 7>A better example,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I smoked dmt wants that.</v>

2927
02:19:16.331 --> 02:19:17.760
<v Speaker 7>I had my,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2928
02:19:17.770 --> 02:19:22.770
<v Speaker 7>my dog jumped on my lap while I was on a</v>
<v Speaker 7>dmt trip and then it came into my dmt</v>

2929
02:19:24.431 --> 02:19:27.230
<v Speaker 7>trip,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like all colorful and in codes and</v>

2930
02:19:27.231 --> 02:19:29.270
<v Speaker 7>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then I saw like,</v>

2931
02:19:29.650 --> 02:19:34.400
<v Speaker 7>like kind of a bit of a dream state of,</v>
<v Speaker 7>of where I would.</v>

2932
02:19:34.790 --> 02:19:39.290
<v Speaker 7>I saw myself setting my dog down.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But I was like sitting in a different</v>

2933
02:19:39.291 --> 02:19:41.510
<v Speaker 7>spot.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was at the kitchen table and it's</v>

2934
02:19:41.511 --> 02:19:45.470
<v Speaker 7>where my dog would normally jump on my</v>
<v Speaker 7>lap and where I'd normally be like no,</v>

2935
02:19:45.471 --> 02:19:48.440
<v Speaker 7>and sit down.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And so it was like accessing that part</v>

2936
02:19:48.441 --> 02:19:52.280
<v Speaker 7>of the brain that has the memory,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like this is when we put the dog down</v>

2937
02:19:52.520 --> 02:19:54.890
<v Speaker 7>and then I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I lifted it off of me and I think</v>

2938
02:19:54.891 --> 02:19:57.680
<v Speaker 7>there's all these.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I see lots of things like that,</v>

2939
02:19:57.681 --> 02:19:58.910
<v Speaker 7>like these,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2940
02:19:59.420 --> 02:20:04.420
<v Speaker 7>like these exemplars,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like these kind of prototype objects</v>

2941
02:20:05.930 --> 02:20:08.600
<v Speaker 7>that your brain is using to retrieve.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like if you,</v>

2942
02:20:08.870 --> 02:20:12.890
<v Speaker 7>if you're gonna throw a Frisbee,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think that you're accessing like this,</v>

2943
02:20:13.400 --> 02:20:17.750
<v Speaker 7>this ideal frisbee throw in your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You could probably close your eyes and</v>

2944
02:20:17.751 --> 02:20:19.550
<v Speaker 7>picture it right now.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And,</v>

2945
02:20:19.700 --> 02:20:23.240
<v Speaker 7>and I think that that's in there like</v>
<v Speaker 7>these prototypes that we,</v>

2946
02:20:23.360 --> 02:20:27.290
<v Speaker 7>that our brain draws off of because I've</v>
<v Speaker 7>seen that on a dmt trip,</v>

2947
02:20:27.320 --> 02:20:31.760
<v Speaker 7>like a silhouette of like a perfect</v>
<v Speaker 7>frisbee throw and then the guy's like</v>

2948
02:20:32.620 --> 02:20:35.090
<v Speaker 7>100 times doing like the same movement</v>
<v Speaker 7>or whatever.</v>

2949
02:20:35.600 --> 02:20:40.600
<v Speaker 7>And just things like that make me think</v>
<v Speaker 7>that it's just some neural process and</v>

2950
02:20:42.490 --> 02:20:47.490
<v Speaker 7>how the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how the brain interprets reality at</v>

2951
02:20:47.811 --> 02:20:50.300
<v Speaker 7>different levels.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You might be right or</v>

2952
02:20:50.680 --> 02:20:53.350
<v Speaker 3>they might not be mutually exclusive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they might intertwine.</v>

2953
02:20:53.710 --> 02:20:56.920
<v Speaker 3>It's entirely possible that everything</v>
<v Speaker 3>is connected and that when you are</v>

2954
02:20:56.921 --> 02:21:00.220
<v Speaker 3>imagining things in the DMT realm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're imagining things in another</v>

2955
02:21:00.221 --> 02:21:03.940
<v Speaker 3>dimension and they're happening in that</v>
<v Speaker 3>dimension because your imagination can</v>

2956
02:21:03.941 --> 02:21:08.941
<v Speaker 3>create things in that bizarre,</v>
<v Speaker 3>detached from your body world that you</v>

2957
02:21:09.971 --> 02:21:12.040
<v Speaker 3>experienced under intense psychedelic</v>
<v Speaker 3>states.</v>

2958
02:21:12.041 --> 02:21:14.260
<v Speaker 3>It might not be mutually exclusive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it might not be,</v>

2959
02:21:14.261 --> 02:21:15.940
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is all my imagination.</v>

2960
02:21:16.540 --> 02:21:18.300
<v Speaker 3>That might be true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You like,</v>

2961
02:21:18.310 --> 02:21:22.240
<v Speaker 3>you might be creating this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that also might be real in that</v>

2962
02:21:22.241 --> 02:21:25.330
<v Speaker 3>dimension,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in that state as far as real goals,</v>

2963
02:21:25.570 --> 02:21:27.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this 15 minute lifetime.</v>

2964
02:21:28.020 --> 02:21:30.640
<v Speaker 3>And that's what you have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have a 15 minute dmt lifetime.</v>

2965
02:21:30.641 --> 02:21:31.620
<v Speaker 3>You're there for 15 minutes.</v>

2966
02:21:31.910 --> 02:21:34.130
<v Speaker 7>I have a most at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you got to go deeper.</v>

2967
02:21:34.131 --> 02:21:39.131
<v Speaker 7>So I</v>
<v Speaker 7>usually use a,</v>

2968
02:21:39.171 --> 02:21:41.810
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a vape pen and vape pen.</v>

2969
02:21:41.870 --> 02:21:43.310
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I have a,</v>

2970
02:21:43.740 --> 02:21:45.680
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>why do you use one of those?</v>

2971
02:21:46.190 --> 02:21:49.060
<v Speaker 7>Because it's a lot smoother.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And um,</v>

2972
02:21:49.190 --> 02:21:52.670
<v Speaker 7>and you can just draw bigger hits and</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's fast.</v>

2973
02:21:52.840 --> 02:21:55.400
<v Speaker 7>Do you use like a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's like an oil vaporizer.</v>

2974
02:21:55.401 --> 02:22:00.401
<v Speaker 7>It has like a little cup in it and you</v>
<v Speaker 7>put the dmt in this little cup and.</v>

2975
02:22:01.100 --> 02:22:02.840
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So you're not talking about like a,</v>

2976
02:22:02.870 --> 02:22:06.080
<v Speaker 7>like a blue cigarette pen talking about</v>
<v Speaker 7>like a fat one,</v>

2977
02:22:06.081 --> 02:22:07.730
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like you would use for your vaping?</v>

2978
02:22:08.060 --> 02:22:08.840
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2979
02:22:08.840 --> 02:22:10.130
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So there's not really a pen,</v>

2980
02:22:10.131 --> 02:22:12.230
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like a more of a vape pipe?</v>

2981
02:22:12.450 --> 02:22:13.750
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

2982
02:22:13.770 --> 02:22:15.660
<v Speaker 7>just that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's uh,</v>

2983
02:22:16.590 --> 02:22:18.980
<v Speaker 7>it's pretty um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>put in,</v>

2984
02:22:19.020 --> 02:22:21.770
<v Speaker 7>put it in cheap pen and you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 7>like a g pen.</v>

2985
02:22:21.890 --> 02:22:22.520
<v Speaker 7>I know what it is.</v>

2986
02:22:22.520 --> 02:22:23.130
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2987
02:22:23.130 --> 02:22:25.100
<v Speaker 7>So one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

2988
02:22:25.920 --> 02:22:28.080
<v Speaker 7>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've tried so many different methods of</v>

2989
02:22:28.081 --> 02:22:30.990
<v Speaker 7>smoking and that's just I think the most</v>
<v Speaker 7>potent way.</v>

2990
02:22:31.590 --> 02:22:36.590
<v Speaker 7>And so I had an intense one about a week</v>
<v Speaker 7>or two ago and I had um,</v>

2991
02:22:38.190 --> 02:22:41.160
<v Speaker 7>I had about six big reps,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I was already in there.</v>

2992
02:22:41.640 --> 02:22:45.390
<v Speaker 7>And then I had two more big ones.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was a,</v>

2993
02:22:45.391 --> 02:22:48.390
<v Speaker 7>it was a bit much.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's going to be a little while before I</v>

2994
02:22:48.391 --> 02:22:50.180
<v Speaker 7>can go back in there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2995
02:22:50.181 --> 02:22:54.060
<v Speaker 7>I'm going to have to process for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I went for years after one or I do want</v>

2996
02:22:54.061 --> 02:22:54.650
<v Speaker 7>to go back.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2997
02:22:54.650 --> 02:22:55.320
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I wonder.</v>

2998
02:22:55.320 --> 02:22:56.340
<v Speaker 7>I went months recently.</v>

2999
02:22:57.180 --> 02:23:00.390
<v Speaker 6>It was so.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was so heavy that I.</v>

3000
02:23:00.390 --> 02:23:01.330
<v Speaker 6>Reality was a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

3001
02:23:01.340 --> 02:23:03.030
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the way I describe it as very slippery</v>

3002
02:23:03.031 --> 02:23:05.760
<v Speaker 6>for like two weeks or everything seemed</v>
<v Speaker 6>fake.</v>

3003
02:23:06.050 --> 02:23:09.120
<v Speaker 6>Like every car driving cars.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was constantly worried about cars</v>

3004
02:23:09.121 --> 02:23:11.780
<v Speaker 6>flying over from other lanes and</v>
<v Speaker 6>smashing into my windshield,</v>

3005
02:23:11.781 --> 02:23:16.781
<v Speaker 6>like all this weird paranoid thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Whereas when I logically and objectively</v>

3006
02:23:18.090 --> 02:23:23.090
<v Speaker 6>feel feel like it's possible that it was</v>
<v Speaker 6>the ego trying to regain control by like</v>

3007
02:23:25.260 --> 02:23:30.260
<v Speaker 6>activating distress and like physical</v>
<v Speaker 6>worry sort of intentions,</v>

3008
02:23:31.260 --> 02:23:35.640
<v Speaker 6>like worry about strangers,</v>
<v Speaker 6>worried about random crime or accidents</v>

3009
02:23:35.641 --> 02:23:36.720
<v Speaker 6>and things along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3010
02:23:36.721 --> 02:23:38.160
<v Speaker 6>that it was like my brain was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>

3011
02:23:38.161 --> 02:23:39.630
<v Speaker 6>the world's a hard fucking place.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>

3012
02:23:39.631 --> 02:23:43.590
<v Speaker 6>It's like the conservative right wing</v>
<v Speaker 6>aspect of the mind sort of kicks in</v>

3013
02:23:43.860 --> 02:23:44.590
<v Speaker 6>tenfold.</v>

3014
02:23:44.590 --> 02:23:45.560
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>

3015
02:23:45.561 --> 02:23:47.000
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've experienced that.</v>

3016
02:23:47.090 --> 02:23:47.923
<v Speaker 7>I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've,</v>

3017
02:23:48.170 --> 02:23:51.050
<v Speaker 7>I've experienced where I'm walking down</v>
<v Speaker 7>the street and then I have to be like,</v>

3018
02:23:51.110 --> 02:23:52.910
<v Speaker 7>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 7>is this real?</v>

3019
02:23:52.970 --> 02:23:55.670
<v Speaker 7>Or was that real?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Because it seemed really real,</v>

3020
02:23:55.700 --> 02:23:59.000
<v Speaker 7>but here's my.</v>
<v Speaker 7>My take on it is that DMT is,</v>

3021
02:23:59.090 --> 02:24:02.720
<v Speaker 7>is to perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like everything's too perfect in there</v>

3022
02:24:02.721 --> 02:24:06.680
<v Speaker 7>and symmetrical like it take,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it would take say this where this world</v>

3023
02:24:06.681 --> 02:24:10.340
<v Speaker 7>that we know is a simulation,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it would take far more computational</v>

3024
02:24:10.341 --> 02:24:14.840
<v Speaker 7>power to put all these little flaws in</v>
<v Speaker 7>to put like a spill on the coffee table</v>

3025
02:24:14.841 --> 02:24:18.470
<v Speaker 7>or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was a 11 billion years since the big</v>

3026
02:24:18.471 --> 02:24:23.471
<v Speaker 7>bang and 4 billion years of evolution</v>
<v Speaker 7>all to get this fucking little spill on</v>

3027
02:24:23.721 --> 02:24:27.290
<v Speaker 7>a coffee table.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Whereas DMT is like these.</v>

3028
02:24:27.890 --> 02:24:31.250
<v Speaker 7>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you can make good dmt representations</v>

3029
02:24:31.251 --> 02:24:35.180
<v Speaker 7>just using some fractal programs and</v>
<v Speaker 7>Alex gray paintings.</v>

3030
02:24:35.300 --> 02:24:38.630
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and that's with like we're doing this</v>

3031
02:24:38.631 --> 02:24:41.930
<v Speaker 7>with computers that we built in where</v>
<v Speaker 7>monkeys,</v>

3032
02:24:42.400 --> 02:24:42.760
<v Speaker 7>right.</v>

3033
02:24:42.760 --> 02:24:44.500
<v Speaker 6>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 6>isn't it just what we're used to.</v>

3034
02:24:44.650 --> 02:24:47.410
<v Speaker 6>We're used to this imperfect world,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so we think the imperfect world is</v>

3035
02:24:47.411 --> 02:24:48.310
<v Speaker 6>normal.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3036
02:24:48.311 --> 02:24:51.550
<v Speaker 6>maybe this is the oddity.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe the oddity of coffee spills is</v>

3037
02:24:51.551 --> 02:24:54.730
<v Speaker 6>what's really strange and that dmt</v>
<v Speaker 6>represents,</v>

3038
02:24:54.731 --> 02:24:57.340
<v Speaker 6>is the energy that creates the world</v>
<v Speaker 6>itself.</v>

3039
02:24:57.370 --> 02:25:01.750
<v Speaker 6>Unharnessed sort of unbridled,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not an unattached to culture,</v>

3040
02:25:01.751 --> 02:25:03.340
<v Speaker 6>language,</v>
<v Speaker 6>physical bodies.</v>

3041
02:25:03.900 --> 02:25:06.790
<v Speaker 6>Any anything that we come to accept as</v>
<v Speaker 6>being a normal thing,</v>

3042
02:25:07.180 --> 02:25:11.080
<v Speaker 7>I think there's a perfect world</v>
<v Speaker 7>simulated within our mind that we're</v>

3043
02:25:11.081 --> 02:25:11.914
<v Speaker 7>trying to act</v>

3044
02:25:12.040 --> 02:25:14.880
<v Speaker 6>hold on bae,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but why make that distinction is the</v>

3045
02:25:15.010 --> 02:25:17.470
<v Speaker 6>question and not that there's anything</v>
<v Speaker 6>wrong with what you're doing versus what</v>

3046
02:25:17.471 --> 02:25:21.040
<v Speaker 6>I'm doing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but why make a choice that it's in your</v>

3047
02:25:21.041 --> 02:25:24.790
<v Speaker 6>mind versus where a lot of people like</v>
<v Speaker 6>to say,</v>

3048
02:25:24.791 --> 02:25:25.630
<v Speaker 6>who the fuck knows?</v>

3049
02:25:25.710 --> 02:25:26.460
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>

3050
02:25:26.460 --> 02:25:28.560
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I say who the fuck knows as well.</v>

3051
02:25:28.890 --> 02:25:31.620
<v Speaker 7>I'm just trying to be objective,</v>
<v Speaker 7>scientific,</v>

3052
02:25:31.621 --> 02:25:32.790
<v Speaker 7>objective,</v>
<v Speaker 7>scientific,</v>

3053
02:25:32.791 --> 02:25:35.190
<v Speaker 7>skeptical of my own perceptions because</v>
<v Speaker 7>when I'm in there,</v>

3054
02:25:35.940 --> 02:25:36.990
<v Speaker 7>I'll come out.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'll be like,</v>

3055
02:25:37.080 --> 02:25:38.490
<v Speaker 7>I just saw God,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no doubt about it.</v>

3056
02:25:39.250 --> 02:25:41.380
<v Speaker 6>Do you feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and this is one of the reasons why I'm</v>

3057
02:25:41.381 --> 02:25:43.420
<v Speaker 6>getting to this line of questioning,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is actually a point to it.</v>

3058
02:25:43.510 --> 02:25:45.520
<v Speaker 6>Do you feel like.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because I know that you do a lot of</v>

3059
02:25:45.521 --> 02:25:48.430
<v Speaker 6>stuff with science and your part of your</v>
<v Speaker 6>presentation,</v>

3060
02:25:48.431 --> 02:25:52.480
<v Speaker 6>your comedy show involve science and</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you're under the scrutiny,</v>

3061
02:25:52.540 --> 02:25:55.720
<v Speaker 6>and this is a very good thing of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>of other scientists and other people</v>

3062
02:25:55.721 --> 02:25:58.640
<v Speaker 6>that are going to judge what you're</v>
<v Speaker 6>saying and making sure that you're,</v>

3063
02:25:58.670 --> 02:25:59.081
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're,</v>

3064
02:25:59.081 --> 02:26:02.560
<v Speaker 6>you're correct about your facts.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you find that you tend to be more</v>

3065
02:26:02.561 --> 02:26:07.561
<v Speaker 6>skeptical or tend to lean towards</v>
<v Speaker 6>outcomes razor more acceptable answers,</v>

3066
02:26:10.180 --> 02:26:15.070
<v Speaker 6>more scientifically plausible or at</v>
<v Speaker 6>least a more scientifically acceptable</v>

3067
02:26:15.071 --> 02:26:16.960
<v Speaker 6>in like academic circles?</v>

3068
02:26:17.060 --> 02:26:18.350
<v Speaker 7>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

3069
02:26:18.351 --> 02:26:21.890
<v Speaker 7>I think that one,</v>
<v Speaker 7>my brain just likes working that way</v>

3070
02:26:21.891 --> 02:26:23.540
<v Speaker 7>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

3071
02:26:23.710 --> 02:26:28.100
<v Speaker 7>I was always like a big fan of math and</v>
<v Speaker 7>a very good at it and I kind of liked</v>

3072
02:26:28.190 --> 02:26:31.220
<v Speaker 7>numbers because you could make sense of</v>
<v Speaker 7>the world.</v>

3073
02:26:31.221 --> 02:26:32.260
<v Speaker 7>And,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and um,</v>

3074
02:26:32.870 --> 02:26:36.200
<v Speaker 7>and I would say that I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was actually scared to the psychedelic</v>

3075
02:26:36.201 --> 02:26:39.170
<v Speaker 7>show that I do now.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was planning on doing it like five</v>

3076
02:26:39.171 --> 02:26:40.490
<v Speaker 7>years from now or so.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was just,</v>

3077
02:26:40.491 --> 02:26:42.680
<v Speaker 7>I've been sitting on it for like a</v>
<v Speaker 7>couple of years really.</v>

3078
02:26:42.980 --> 02:26:44.750
<v Speaker 7>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was like,</v>

3079
02:26:44.751 --> 02:26:47.060
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>once I'm like a bigger name or</v>

3080
02:26:47.061 --> 02:26:49.040
<v Speaker 7>something,</v>
<v Speaker 7>then maybe I'll have the power to go out</v>

3081
02:26:49.041 --> 02:26:52.850
<v Speaker 7>and do this because I have my podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I interviewed scientists each week and I</v>

3082
02:26:52.851 --> 02:26:54.260
<v Speaker 7>need to reach out to these people.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm like,</v>

3083
02:26:54.290 --> 02:26:55.910
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't want them thinking I'm like some</v>

3084
02:26:55.911 --> 02:26:58.640
<v Speaker 7>burnout or some lunatic or something</v>
<v Speaker 7>like that.</v>

3085
02:26:58.940 --> 02:27:01.370
<v Speaker 7>So absolutely that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Absolutely,</v>

3086
02:27:01.640 --> 02:27:03.590
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>factors in,</v>

3087
02:27:03.591 --> 02:27:08.591
<v Speaker 7>in my perception of things as does.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean also,</v>

3088
02:27:08.660 --> 02:27:11.000
<v Speaker 7>none of,</v>
<v Speaker 7>none of my memories of any of this stuff</v>

3089
02:27:11.001 --> 02:27:13.790
<v Speaker 7>are reliable.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You don't be interesting with your,</v>

3090
02:27:14.210 --> 02:27:16.640
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>with the idea you're talking about</v>

3091
02:27:16.641 --> 02:27:18.650
<v Speaker 7>before,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if you scan someone's brain and then you</v>

3092
02:27:18.651 --> 02:27:21.320
<v Speaker 7>saw,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you watched the replay of them hitting a</v>

3093
02:27:21.321 --> 02:27:25.250
<v Speaker 7>home run or something.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well that memory wouldn't necessarily be</v>

3094
02:27:25.251 --> 02:27:26.300
<v Speaker 7>accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 7>In fact,</v>

3095
02:27:26.301 --> 02:27:27.920
<v Speaker 7>there's a good chance that it wouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 7>be.</v>

3096
02:27:27.950 --> 02:27:29.210
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And so you could,</v>

3097
02:27:29.300 --> 02:27:34.300
<v Speaker 7>you could see different people's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how people's memory looks as opposed to</v>

3098
02:27:35.570 --> 02:27:40.130
<v Speaker 7>what was actually captured on,</v>
<v Speaker 7>on CC TV or whatever it might be,</v>

3099
02:27:40.160 --> 02:27:41.030
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>as a,</v>

3100
02:27:41.031 --> 02:27:41.500
<v Speaker 7>your exam.</v>

3101
02:27:41.500 --> 02:27:42.610
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the hot and cold thing,</v>

3102
02:27:42.611 --> 02:27:45.580
<v Speaker 6>but how all the different factors that</v>
<v Speaker 6>sort of are involved.</v>

3103
02:27:45.581 --> 02:27:47.170
<v Speaker 6>And how you feel about things.</v>

3104
02:27:47.330 --> 02:27:48.220
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And,</v>

3105
02:27:48.340 --> 02:27:51.710
<v Speaker 7>and just everyone also were very ego</v>
<v Speaker 7>driven.</v>

3106
02:27:51.711 --> 02:27:56.600
<v Speaker 7>We tend to think that we tend to think</v>
<v Speaker 7>that we're smarter and more attractive</v>

3107
02:27:56.601 --> 02:28:00.020
<v Speaker 7>and more skilled driver or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 7>All the above,</v>

3108
02:28:01.170 --> 02:28:02.270
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that uh,</v>

3109
02:28:02.330 --> 02:28:05.840
<v Speaker 7>do you know the study where they took</v>
<v Speaker 7>the faces and they morph to them.</v>

3110
02:28:05.870 --> 02:28:10.160
<v Speaker 7>I'm like 10 degrees,</v>
<v Speaker 7>five times in each way to make them more</v>

3111
02:28:10.161 --> 02:28:12.950
<v Speaker 7>or less attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So you take your face and then you make</v>

3112
02:28:12.951 --> 02:28:15.830
<v Speaker 7>it 10 percent more symmetrical,</v>
<v Speaker 7>20 percent more symmetrical,</v>

3113
02:28:15.860 --> 02:28:19.640
<v Speaker 7>so on to like 50 percent and then you</v>
<v Speaker 7>make it less symmetrical.</v>

3114
02:28:19.641 --> 02:28:23.060
<v Speaker 7>And so you get a job,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a real faced by that and not in the ugly</v>

3115
02:28:23.061 --> 02:28:25.520
<v Speaker 7>one.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then you mix up all of those faces</v>

3116
02:28:25.910 --> 02:28:29.080
<v Speaker 7>and you have a.</v>
<v Speaker 7>and you flash,</v>

3117
02:28:29.360 --> 02:28:32.180
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>all of the pictures I'll all mixed up to</v>

3118
02:28:32.181 --> 02:28:34.760
<v Speaker 7>a person and give them a second to pick</v>
<v Speaker 7>it or whatever.</v>

3119
02:28:34.761 --> 02:28:39.020
<v Speaker 7>And people,</v>
<v Speaker 7>pr people predictively a,</v>

3120
02:28:39.680 --> 02:28:43.310
<v Speaker 7>we'll pick the one that's 10 to 20</v>
<v Speaker 7>percent more attractive.</v>

3121
02:28:43.580 --> 02:28:46.520
<v Speaker 7>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you think of yourself as like 10 to 20</v>

3122
02:28:46.521 --> 02:28:49.640
<v Speaker 7>percent,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like around 50 percent smarter,</v>

3123
02:28:49.641 --> 02:28:50.900
<v Speaker 7>more attractive,</v>
<v Speaker 7>more skilled.</v>

3124
02:28:50.901 --> 02:28:53.780
<v Speaker 7>At driving whatever it might be,</v>
<v Speaker 7>because that gives you the confidence</v>

3125
02:28:53.781 --> 02:28:56.960
<v Speaker 7>which is often beneficial in life,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it's not,</v>

3126
02:28:57.170 --> 02:29:01.730
<v Speaker 7>you're not thinking 30 percent more</v>
<v Speaker 7>because now you're delusional if some</v>

3127
02:29:01.731 --> 02:29:03.590
<v Speaker 7>people do though some.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh yeah,</v>

3128
02:29:03.591 --> 02:29:06.680
<v Speaker 7>there's tip that scale and,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and there's people with low self esteem</v>

3129
02:29:06.681 --> 02:29:07.670
<v Speaker 7>that don't,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3130
02:29:08.120 --> 02:29:08.953
<v Speaker 7>there's a lot of factors.</v>

3131
02:29:08.960 --> 02:29:09.793
<v Speaker 2>Various.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3132
02:29:09.840 --> 02:29:13.320
<v Speaker 2>there are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also one person's perception of you</v>

3133
02:29:13.380 --> 02:29:17.190
<v Speaker 2>like objective perception might be very</v>
<v Speaker 2>different like you and I might observe</v>

3134
02:29:17.191 --> 02:29:20.320
<v Speaker 2>someone and you might come away with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>take like,</v>

3135
02:29:20.340 --> 02:29:21.930
<v Speaker 2>oh this guy is this and that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'd be like,</v>

3136
02:29:21.960 --> 02:29:23.610
<v Speaker 2>hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought he was this or that.</v>

3137
02:29:23.730 --> 02:29:25.560
<v Speaker 2>And then we would discuss it and then I</v>
<v Speaker 2>figured out,</v>

3138
02:29:25.561 --> 02:29:29.010
<v Speaker 2>well he reminded you of this asshole</v>
<v Speaker 2>used to know and he reminded me and my</v>

3139
02:29:29.011 --> 02:29:31.500
<v Speaker 2>best friend from high school and just</v>
<v Speaker 2>weird</v>

3140
02:29:33.300 --> 02:29:34.350
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

3141
02:29:34.380 --> 02:29:37.500
<v Speaker 2>things we bring into how we approach</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

3142
02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:40.830
<v Speaker 2>Your brain to save.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can't,</v>

3143
02:29:41.190 --> 02:29:45.480
<v Speaker 2>you just can't sit and analyze every</v>
<v Speaker 2>little aspect every.</v>

3144
02:29:45.660 --> 02:29:50.010
<v Speaker 2>I could sit in this table and like</v>
<v Speaker 2>really see every single little grain of</v>

3145
02:29:50.011 --> 02:29:52.710
<v Speaker 2>it if I wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at some point the brain has to be</v>

3146
02:29:52.711 --> 02:29:53.431
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who cares?</v>

3147
02:29:53.431 --> 02:29:55.410
<v Speaker 2>That's not valuable information.</v>

3148
02:29:55.410 --> 02:29:57.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to eat unless you're going to</v>

3149
02:29:57.790 --> 02:29:59.880
<v Speaker 2>sleep too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of conclusions.</v>

3150
02:29:59.881 --> 02:30:01.800
<v Speaker 2>We stereotype.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We simplify,</v>

3151
02:30:01.830 --> 02:30:05.130
<v Speaker 2>overly simplify everything and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the reasons why we chastise</v>

3152
02:30:05.131 --> 02:30:09.120
<v Speaker 2>people for racism because we know how</v>
<v Speaker 2>easily the inclination to judge people</v>

3153
02:30:09.121 --> 02:30:14.121
<v Speaker 2>specifically on what they look like and</v>
<v Speaker 2>how unfair it is and how reminding</v>

3154
02:30:14.251 --> 02:30:16.350
<v Speaker 2>ourselves over and over again and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>not cool.</v>

3155
02:30:16.490 --> 02:30:20.160
<v Speaker 2>It gives the whole culture more of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>relaxed feeling.</v>

3156
02:30:20.520 --> 02:30:23.460
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Humans are so strange,</v>

3157
02:30:23.461 --> 02:30:24.240
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're so.</v>

3158
02:30:24.240 --> 02:30:26.310
<v Speaker 2>It's so cool to be a person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

3159
02:30:26.311 --> 02:30:28.590
<v Speaker 2>It's so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so bizarre when you think about all</v>

3160
02:30:28.591 --> 02:30:32.640
<v Speaker 2>the variables and the possibilities of</v>
<v Speaker 2>human behavior and how different</v>

3161
02:30:32.641 --> 02:30:35.970
<v Speaker 2>cultures except certain things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we look different and we live in</v>

3162
02:30:35.971 --> 02:30:40.560
<v Speaker 2>different climates and we're such an odd</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking creature that's just completely</v>

3163
02:30:40.561 --> 02:30:41.850
<v Speaker 2>overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This globe.</v>

3164
02:30:42.020 --> 02:30:45.350
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's existence is a bizarre thing that I</v>

3165
02:30:45.360 --> 02:30:47.780
<v Speaker 7>just,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I can't get my head around existence.</v>

3166
02:30:47.781 --> 02:30:49.790
<v Speaker 7>I always,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I never really liked it that much.</v>

3167
02:30:49.850 --> 02:30:51.090
<v Speaker 7>But existence.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3168
02:30:51.770 --> 02:30:55.200
<v Speaker 2>Broke your heels or after.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Before when I was a kid.</v>

3169
02:30:55.260 --> 02:30:57.480
<v Speaker 2>When you were all crossfitted up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't like existence.</v>

3170
02:30:57.880 --> 02:30:58.411
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>

3171
02:30:58.411 --> 02:31:01.160
<v Speaker 2>Then</v>
<v Speaker 2>A.</v>

3172
02:31:01.160 --> 02:31:01.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

3173
02:31:01.760 --> 02:31:04.470
<v Speaker 2>Then you were healthy and vibrant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3174
02:31:04.530 --> 02:31:05.230
<v Speaker 2>Energy.</v>

3175
02:31:05.230 --> 02:31:06.290
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

3176
02:31:06.310 --> 02:31:11.050
<v Speaker 7>I mean when I was like a young angsty,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like [inaudible] young man,</v>

3177
02:31:11.110 --> 02:31:15.250
<v Speaker 7>I'm very bitter about the world,</v>
<v Speaker 7>about a lot of very depressed.</v>

3178
02:31:15.790 --> 02:31:16.480
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>

3179
02:31:16.480 --> 02:31:18.760
<v Speaker 7>I mean when I'd be,</v>
<v Speaker 7>when I started comedy,</v>

3180
02:31:18.761 --> 02:31:21.870
<v Speaker 7>when I've,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean I used to drink like a lunatic,</v>

3181
02:31:21.871 --> 02:31:24.450
<v Speaker 7>now I drink more like a normal person,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but um,</v>

3182
02:31:24.900 --> 02:31:29.900
<v Speaker 7>I would when I was my most hung over,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which I'd only get like four hangover as</v>

3183
02:31:30.241 --> 02:31:31.420
<v Speaker 7>a year.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

3184
02:31:31.620 --> 02:31:34.350
<v Speaker 7>but when I was as sick as I've ever</v>
<v Speaker 7>been,</v>

3185
02:31:34.410 --> 02:31:38.550
<v Speaker 7>that's when I get my best writing done.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was like some self defense mechanism</v>

3186
02:31:38.551 --> 02:31:41.160
<v Speaker 7>where something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>My brain doesn't operate like that</v>

3187
02:31:41.161 --> 02:31:41.994
<v Speaker 7>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But,</v>

3188
02:31:42.060 --> 02:31:44.010
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think when you're in periods of</v>

3189
02:31:44.150 --> 02:31:49.150
<v Speaker 3>extreme emotion or energy or just a</v>
<v Speaker 3>transitionary mode in your life,</v>

3190
02:31:49.581 --> 02:31:52.880
<v Speaker 3>whether it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a breakup or the end of a job,</v>

3191
02:31:52.881 --> 02:31:56.090
<v Speaker 3>or moving to a new place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of kicks in this,</v>

3192
02:31:56.900 --> 02:32:01.670
<v Speaker 3>this effect is the newness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the novelty of that experience sort of</v>

3193
02:32:01.671 --> 02:32:04.640
<v Speaker 3>kicks in this effect where you want to</v>
<v Speaker 3>express yourself.</v>

3194
02:32:04.641 --> 02:32:06.850
<v Speaker 3>You want to sort of reestablish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3195
02:32:06.851 --> 02:32:08.510
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your point of view on things,</v>

3196
02:32:08.511 --> 02:32:11.120
<v Speaker 3>your perspective on things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of great stuff comes from that.</v>

3197
02:32:11.121 --> 02:32:11.954
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of,</v>

3198
02:32:12.240 --> 02:32:14.170
<v Speaker 3>a lot of great music especially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3199
02:32:14.200 --> 02:32:16.790
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>teen angst and anger is like,</v>

3200
02:32:16.830 --> 02:32:19.220
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where's the nirvana without angst,</v>

3201
02:32:20.320 --> 02:32:21.050
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3202
02:32:21.050 --> 02:32:24.200
<v Speaker 3>one of the greatest bands of all time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he raped me,</v>

3203
02:32:24.201 --> 02:32:25.190
<v Speaker 3>my friend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

3204
02:32:25.191 --> 02:32:26.060
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3205
02:32:26.090 --> 02:32:29.390
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is just pure response to just the,</v>

3206
02:32:29.480 --> 02:32:30.021
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3207
02:32:30.021 --> 02:32:31.930
<v Speaker 3>the frustrations of the world,</v>

3208
02:32:32.020 --> 02:32:34.840
<v Speaker 7>preaching to the choir.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And Nirvana was my first love dude</v>

3209
02:32:35.600 --> 02:32:38.540
<v Speaker 3>to this day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember Buddy mind playing it for me.</v>

3210
02:32:39.170 --> 02:32:40.250
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

3211
02:32:40.251 --> 02:32:42.860
<v Speaker 3>it was a cassette tape and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're in Newton,</v>

3212
02:32:42.861 --> 02:32:44.660
<v Speaker 3>Massachusetts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't even my friend who's my</v>

3213
02:32:44.661 --> 02:32:46.130
<v Speaker 3>friend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jimmy's friend were over his house.</v>

3214
02:32:46.131 --> 02:32:47.120
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to hear this.</v>

3215
02:32:47.180 --> 02:32:48.980
<v Speaker 3>It's called Nirvana.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we play.</v>

3216
02:32:48.981 --> 02:32:50.540
<v Speaker 3>And we were both like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>

3217
02:32:51.380 --> 02:32:54.260
<v Speaker 3>This guy's went deep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was smells like teen spirit,</v>

3218
02:32:54.261 --> 02:32:54.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3219
02:32:54.800 --> 02:32:57.640
<v Speaker 7>I hadn't really listened to any music.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

3220
02:32:57.650 --> 02:33:01.550
<v Speaker 7>at the time that I discovered Nirvana,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I discovered Nirvana through weird Al</v>

3221
02:33:01.610 --> 02:33:04.250
<v Speaker 7>did a parody of smells like teen spirit</v>
<v Speaker 7>that I liked.</v>

3222
02:33:04.251 --> 02:33:07.250
<v Speaker 7>And then I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that music sounds pretty cool.</v>

3223
02:33:07.251 --> 02:33:10.170
<v Speaker 7>And then I found the real version and</v>
<v Speaker 7>that was like the first time I found</v>

3224
02:33:10.171 --> 02:33:12.470
<v Speaker 7>that I enjoyed music.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That wasn't a joke.</v>

3225
02:33:12.770 --> 02:33:15.950
<v Speaker 7>My friend Eddie was in a band back in</v>
<v Speaker 7>those days and he was like,</v>

3226
02:33:16.070 --> 02:33:18.320
<v Speaker 7>he was in a metal,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it was like a metal band.</v>

3227
02:33:18.710 --> 02:33:20.810
<v Speaker 7>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he was like,</v>

3228
02:33:20.870 --> 02:33:22.010
<v Speaker 7>that song,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

3229
02:33:22.011 --> 02:33:26.570
<v Speaker 7>that band completely killed metal.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They completely killed hair bands like</v>

3230
02:33:26.600 --> 02:33:31.580
<v Speaker 7>poison and those kinds of bands,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they just died because they seem so</v>

3231
02:33:31.581 --> 02:33:32.414
<v Speaker 7>silly,</v>

3232
02:33:33.510 --> 02:33:34.343
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3233
02:33:34.920 --> 02:33:39.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just seemed like a,</v>

3234
02:33:41.820 --> 02:33:42.620
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

3235
02:33:42.620 --> 02:33:43.630
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3236
02:33:43.770 --> 02:33:47.490
<v Speaker 3>it's like you had water in your ear and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got the water out of your ear and</v>

3237
02:33:47.870 --> 02:33:49.790
<v Speaker 3>you could hear and you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

3238
02:33:49.800 --> 02:33:51.830
<v Speaker 3>what's your stuff at Europe with cotton</v>
<v Speaker 3>mouth?</v>

3239
02:33:52.380 --> 02:33:53.980
<v Speaker 3>Do not wear makeup,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no,</v>

3240
02:33:53.990 --> 02:33:56.400
<v Speaker 3>putting on hairspray.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not teasing my hair up.</v>

3241
02:33:57.480 --> 02:34:01.680
<v Speaker 3>This is something about the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the real rawness of that music.</v>

3242
02:34:02.170 --> 02:34:03.750
<v Speaker 3>I mean even guns n roses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3243
02:34:03.930 --> 02:34:05.820
<v Speaker 3>Remember when Axel rose used to tease</v>
<v Speaker 3>his hair?</v>

3244
02:34:06.060 --> 02:34:08.910
<v Speaker 3>He says Harris all sprayed up and fucked</v>
<v Speaker 3>up like a,</v>

3245
02:34:08.940 --> 02:34:11.820
<v Speaker 3>like an eighties girl from Dallas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That.</v>

3246
02:34:12.120 --> 02:34:14.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when Nirvana came along and it was like</v>

3247
02:34:14.071 --> 02:34:15.480
<v Speaker 3>losing them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No more hairspray,</v>

3248
02:34:15.481 --> 02:34:17.890
<v Speaker 3>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's just not working,</v>

3249
02:34:17.891 --> 02:34:18.724
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3250
02:34:18.850 --> 02:34:19.683
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

3251
02:34:20.190 --> 02:34:22.360
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's so much great comedy that came</v>

3252
02:34:22.361 --> 02:34:24.240
<v Speaker 7>out of anger and go to.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

3253
02:34:24.290 --> 02:34:25.123
<v Speaker 7>there is areas</v>

3254
02:34:25.260 --> 02:34:30.030
<v Speaker 2>is teased up here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you go to the welcome to the jungle,</v>

3255
02:34:30.180 --> 02:34:33.720
<v Speaker 2>welcome to the jungle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A video is the best example of it.</v>

3256
02:34:34.620 --> 02:34:35.700
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

3257
02:34:35.701 --> 02:34:39.900
<v Speaker 2>that the different shifts in culture and</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's acceptable and then just becomes</v>

3258
02:34:39.901 --> 02:34:42.390
<v Speaker 2>completely ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that,</v>

3259
02:34:44.840 --> 02:34:46.370
<v Speaker 3>get all that hair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's great</v>

3260
02:34:46.390 --> 02:34:49.030
<v Speaker 2>busy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that was what people did back then.</v>

3261
02:34:49.690 --> 02:34:51.700
<v Speaker 2>That was like a big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a big look.</v>

3262
02:34:52.570 --> 02:34:53.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had so many tattoos.</v>

3263
02:34:53.921 --> 02:34:54.760
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

3264
02:34:54.761 --> 02:34:56.560
<v Speaker 2>that guy's ruined his body with all</v>
<v Speaker 2>those tattoos,</v>

3265
02:34:56.561 --> 02:34:59.080
<v Speaker 2>but I remember thinking that when I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>a kid,</v>

3266
02:35:00.760 --> 02:35:02.570
<v Speaker 7>still aI.</v>
<v Speaker 7>still haven't.</v>

3267
02:35:02.630 --> 02:35:07.630
<v Speaker 7>I'm a natural like midwestern aversion</v>
<v Speaker 7>to tattoos that like I think tattoos are</v>

3268
02:35:09.930 --> 02:35:12.750
<v Speaker 7>like I'm starting to grow and</v>
<v Speaker 7>appreciation for them,</v>

3269
02:35:12.751 --> 02:35:17.400
<v Speaker 7>but it's taken me work to,</v>
<v Speaker 7>to get there and I don't have any</v>

3270
02:35:17.401 --> 02:35:19.400
<v Speaker 7>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's embracing in the</v>

3271
02:35:19.520 --> 02:35:22.700
<v Speaker 3>finite</v>
<v Speaker 3>aspect of life.</v>

3272
02:35:22.760 --> 02:35:25.940
<v Speaker 3>This is not going to last like this idea</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're going to ruin your body</v>

3273
02:35:25.941 --> 02:35:27.410
<v Speaker 3>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your body's not going to be around</v>

3274
02:35:27.411 --> 02:35:28.440
<v Speaker 3>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3275
02:35:28.460 --> 02:35:30.060
<v Speaker 3>like what's it gonna look like when</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're 80?</v>

3276
02:35:30.070 --> 02:35:32.770
<v Speaker 3>Do you think anybody wants to see your</v>
<v Speaker 3>back when you're 80?</v>

3277
02:35:33.280 --> 02:35:36.380
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter if this unit looks</v>
<v Speaker 3>like shit,</v>

3278
02:35:37.020 --> 02:35:40.100
<v Speaker 3>crazy wrinkly back and back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then when that time comes,</v>

3279
02:35:40.101 --> 02:35:41.960
<v Speaker 3>you're just going to be concentrating on</v>
<v Speaker 3>staying alive.</v>

3280
02:35:42.300 --> 02:35:46.410
<v Speaker 7>I liked the idea of having like little</v>
<v Speaker 7>snapshots from your life.</v>

3281
02:35:46.470 --> 02:35:49.830
<v Speaker 7>Even if even if say or tattoo has</v>
<v Speaker 7>nothing to do with anything,</v>

3282
02:35:49.980 --> 02:35:54.120
<v Speaker 7>the cool design,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you'll still remember that period of</v>

3283
02:35:54.121 --> 02:35:57.750
<v Speaker 7>your life a little bit more.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think looking at that tattoo,</v>

3284
02:35:57.751 --> 02:36:00.480
<v Speaker 7>you'll remember when you got it and</v>
<v Speaker 7>where you were at that state.</v>

3285
02:36:00.630 --> 02:36:01.880
<v Speaker 7>That's what Anthony Bourdain has.</v>

3286
02:36:01.950 --> 02:36:04.270
<v Speaker 3>It was a gang of tattoos all from</v>
<v Speaker 3>different trips,</v>

3287
02:36:04.450 --> 02:36:06.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like get some different trips and so it</v>

3288
02:36:06.610 --> 02:36:08.290
<v Speaker 3>reminds them of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got this in Bali,</v>

3289
02:36:08.291 --> 02:36:09.850
<v Speaker 3>this was from Hawaii.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is.</v>

3290
02:36:10.210 --> 02:36:13.630
<v Speaker 3>And having something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's to him,</v>

3291
02:36:13.631 --> 02:36:17.500
<v Speaker 3>it's like these anchors for these</v>
<v Speaker 3>incredible experiences that he's at</v>

3292
02:36:17.510 --> 02:36:20.680
<v Speaker 3>because who the fuck has traveled more</v>
<v Speaker 3>over the world and that guy,</v>

3293
02:36:20.681 --> 02:36:22.660
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you'd look good in a Japanese</v>

3294
02:36:22.661 --> 02:36:23.494
<v Speaker 3>body suit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>

3295
02:36:23.540 --> 02:36:26.830
<v Speaker 3>What do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the Japanese body suit go crazy</v>

3296
02:36:26.831 --> 02:36:31.320
<v Speaker 3>Yakuza style that go from the neck down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have everything all the way your</v>

3297
02:36:31.330 --> 02:36:32.800
<v Speaker 3>butt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the way down to your feet.</v>

3298
02:36:33.400 --> 02:36:35.360
<v Speaker 3>I'm not picturing what you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This guy.</v>

<v Speaker 7>shift.</v>

3393
02:40:34.861 --> 02:40:39.570

<v Speaker 7>We raised the guy that I know.</v>

3394
02:40:40.530 --> 02:40:45.530
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so the cop was driving past me and then</v>

3395
02:40:45.720 --> 02:40:50.110
<v Speaker 7>he saw me and then he had to turn around</v>
<v Speaker 7>and uh,</v>

3396
02:40:50.111 --> 02:40:52.530
<v Speaker 7>I think guys like speeding or something</v>
<v Speaker 7>like that and then,</v>

3397
02:40:52.620 --> 02:40:55.740
<v Speaker 7>but he had to go past me and turned</v>
<v Speaker 7>around and it was like in my</v>

3398
02:40:55.741 --> 02:40:59.280
<v Speaker 7>neighborhood and I knew exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I just took a couple turns quick and hid</v>

3399
02:40:59.281 --> 02:41:02.820
<v Speaker 7>behind a building,</v>
<v Speaker 7>turned my lights off and I saw like I</v>

<v Speaker 7>Pull up to the stop sign.</v>

3402
02:41:06.030 --> 02:41:09.900
<v Speaker 7>I saw him looking for me back and forth</v>
<v Speaker 7>through this road and then I saw him</v>

3403
02:41:09.901 --> 02:41:13.950
<v Speaker 7>take off in the other direction and then</v>
<v Speaker 7>I just fucking flipped around and I got</v>

02:41:42.800 --> 02:41:47.800
<v Speaker 7>I was driving and I was like flying.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know what my reasoning was</v>

3415
02:41:48.361 --> 02:41:49.470
<v Speaker 7>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like I said,</v>

3416
02:41:49.471 --> 02:41:52.530
<v Speaker 7>I was an adrenaline junkie but I was</v>
<v Speaker 7>like flying through stop signs and</v>

3417
02:41:52.531 --> 02:41:54.780
<v Speaker 7>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was going 70 miles an hour in a 20</v>

3418
02:41:54.781 --> 02:41:59.490
<v Speaker 7>mile an hour zone and like three or four</v>
<v Speaker 7>in the morning I was trying to get back</v>

3419
02:41:59.491 --> 02:42:01.620
<v Speaker 7>to my friend's house before they went to</v>
<v Speaker 7>bed.</v>

3420
02:42:01.621 --> 02:42:05.850
<v Speaker 7>So I go to have a place to crash.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That was like my weird logic behind it.</v>

3421
02:42:06.240 --> 02:42:11.240
<v Speaker 7>And also it was fun for me to be be</v>
<v Speaker 7>trunk and driving this past and I blew</v>

3422
02:42:12.481 --> 02:42:17.481
<v Speaker 7>through stop signs and then I saw and</v>
<v Speaker 7>then I saw this car with its lights on</v>

3423
02:42:18.140 --> 02:42:18.901
<v Speaker 7>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>fuck,</v>

3424
02:42:18.901 --> 02:42:21.440
<v Speaker 7>that's a cop.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But I just kept on driving anyway.</v>

3425
02:42:21.450 --> 02:42:23.670
<v Speaker 7>And I that fast.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I kept on,</v>

3426
02:42:23.671 --> 02:42:27.750
<v Speaker 7>like swerving around corners and he was</v>
<v Speaker 7>catching up to me like pretty easily.</v>

3427
02:42:28.170 --> 02:42:32.040
<v Speaker 7>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and then when he put his lights on I</v>

3428
02:42:32.041 --> 02:42:34.530
<v Speaker 7>pulled over and then he came up and I</v>
<v Speaker 7>was like,</v>

3429
02:42:34.860 --> 02:42:37.890
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>thank God I thought you were this person</v>

3430
02:42:37.891 --> 02:42:39.750
<v Speaker 7>that was chasing me.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They had this,</v>

3431
02:42:39.900 --> 02:42:44.470
<v Speaker 7>this dodge neon that was like similar</v>
<v Speaker 7>kind of a made up like headlights that</v>

3432
02:42:44.480 --> 02:42:46.620
<v Speaker 7>would look similar.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Instastory yeah.</v>

3433
02:42:46.650 --> 02:42:48.660
<v Speaker 7>And,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and there's like a couple people,</v>

3434
02:42:48.900 --> 02:42:51.540
<v Speaker 7>a couple of cops showed up and I was,</v>
<v Speaker 7>because they called me in when,</v>

3435
02:42:51.541 --> 02:42:52.440
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>when they're like,</v>

3436
02:42:52.441 --> 02:42:53.760
<v Speaker 7>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this is chase.</v>

3437
02:42:53.761 --> 02:42:55.140
<v Speaker 7>But as soon as the guy put his lights</v>
<v Speaker 7>on,</v>

3438
02:42:55.141 --> 02:42:58.860
<v Speaker 7>I pulled right over and um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and he,</v>

3439
02:43:00.030 --> 02:43:03.540
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3440
02:43:03.541 --> 02:43:06.140
<v Speaker 7>these two dudes or what,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it's like,</v>

3441
02:43:06.210 --> 02:43:11.210
<v Speaker 7>I think they're kind of let me go.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then this woman cop showed up that</v>

3442
02:43:11.531 --> 02:43:15.100
<v Speaker 7>knew me because I have like $1,100</v>
