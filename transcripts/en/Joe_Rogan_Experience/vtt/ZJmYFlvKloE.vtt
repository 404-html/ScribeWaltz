<v Speaker 1>anymore?</v>

3
00:00:06.541 --> 00:00:08.880
<v Speaker 1>We'd killed that were good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nick,</v>

4
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:09.870
<v Speaker 1>how are you buddy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty good.</v>

5
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.180
<v Speaker 1>Well thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've got this hat on.</v>

6
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.720
<v Speaker 1>Nick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Curse on that.</v>

7
00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:15.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying not last name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Curtis in Carson.</v>

8
00:00:15.811 --> 00:00:17.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Chris and have you.</v>

9
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.480
<v Speaker 1>You train a Hofeld Osan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe's a Russell on providing the cough </v>

10
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.570
<v Speaker 1>and you've got his hat on roofs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Salons hat on.</v>

11
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:29.620
<v Speaker 1>It says what does it say again?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ratzy bowler hats and in Russian I </v>

12
00:00:29.701 --> 00:00:34.190
<v Speaker 1>believe that translates to something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like young warrior or young fighter,</v>

13
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.260
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's funny because I ran into a couple</v>

14
00:00:37.261 --> 00:00:42.261
<v Speaker 1>of Russians the other day and asked them</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they knew what it meant and they </v>

15
00:00:42.261 --> 00:00:42.261
<v Speaker 1>didn't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just need.</v>

16
00:00:42.261 --> 00:00:44.110
<v Speaker 1>The last part was fighter and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't know that the first apartment.</v>

17
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.180
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy is a character providing the </v>

18
00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.180
<v Speaker 1>crops.</v>

19
00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.780
<v Speaker 1>One of my favorite fighters to watch </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he can't be in a boring fight.</v>

20
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.830
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't have it at him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that guy fights like the most </v>

21
00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:58.320
<v Speaker 1>exciting style of fighting inboxing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

22
00:00:58.321 --> 00:01:01.020
<v Speaker 1>It just comes at you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

23
00:01:01.021 --> 00:01:03.550
<v Speaker 1>he's just an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately.</v>

24
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.400
<v Speaker 1>He takes a little too much punishment </v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

25
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well he's almost too brave.</v>

26
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

27
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.530
<v Speaker 1>almost two brave in too tough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but fucking not fight with Matisa.</v>

28
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.330
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was insane.</v>

29
00:01:15.331 --> 00:01:17.190
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was what everybody was hoping.</v>

30
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.530
<v Speaker 1>Floyd Mayweather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be made with a pack.</v>

31
00:01:19.531 --> 00:01:24.531
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what everybody was hoping it </v>

32
00:01:24.531 --> 00:01:24.531
<v Speaker 1>would be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

33
00:01:24.531 --> 00:01:24.531
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys are out of your mind.</v>

34
00:01:24.531 --> 00:01:25.380
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what you're about to </v>
<v Speaker 1>watch.</v>

35
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.240
<v Speaker 1>You guys are spending millions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars.</v>

36
00:01:27.241 --> 00:01:28.800
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be like the biggest gate </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>

37
00:01:28.801 --> 00:01:33.801
<v Speaker 1>And what you're going to watch is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>floyd mayweather exhibition on movement </v>

38
00:01:33.801 --> 00:01:37.140
<v Speaker 1>and Jabbing and straight rights lead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

39
00:01:37.141 --> 00:01:39.570
<v Speaker 1>Hands clench.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get out of the way.</v>

40
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you're going to say.</v>

41
00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:42.750
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what it was.</v>

42
00:01:42.751 --> 00:01:44.430
<v Speaker 1>But providing a cough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

43
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.810
<v Speaker 1>how do you think the guys feel the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

44
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.500
<v Speaker 1>tuned into the child's junior fight that</v>
<v Speaker 1>night and miss the Monica?</v>

45
00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:52.710
<v Speaker 1>They were silly.</v>

46
00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:56.400
<v Speaker 1>I watched both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

47
00:01:56.401 --> 00:01:59.540
<v Speaker 1>that's the beautiful thing about dvrs </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chavez Jr.</v>

48
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.230
<v Speaker 1>Looks like he's phoning it in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

49
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.560
<v Speaker 1>He just does not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look like the same guy like daddy </v>

50
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.540
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't when he was younger and much </v>
<v Speaker 1>more exciting and just looked,</v>

51
00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.900
<v Speaker 1>looked like a real promising future </v>
<v Speaker 1>champion.</v>

52
00:02:09.901 --> 00:02:12.120
<v Speaker 1>He just doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have the volume anymore.</v>

53
00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.690
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't look like he's in shape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fighting much heavier,</v>

54
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.590
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

55
00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm a tsa and providing a cup fight with</v>
<v Speaker 1>something else.</v>

56
00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.630
<v Speaker 1>So you're a strength and conditioning </v>
<v Speaker 1>coach.</v>

57
00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.850
<v Speaker 1>And one of the reasons whY I wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>call you and here is because I am </v>

58
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.500
<v Speaker 1>absolutely fascinated by the marina </v>
<v Speaker 1>bitches,</v>

59
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.620
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guys who taught you a lot of what </v>

60
00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.800
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

61
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm also fascinated by just tHe </v>
<v Speaker 1>boundaries of human potential when it </v>

62
00:02:39.001 --> 00:02:40.800
<v Speaker 1>comes to strength and conditioning </v>
<v Speaker 1>because as,</v>

63
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.430
<v Speaker 1>as an analyst,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a guy who sits there and watch his </v>

64
00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.221
<v Speaker 1>fights and I've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know how many fights would </v>

65
00:02:49.221 --> 00:02:51.870
<v Speaker 1>have probably professionally called </v>
<v Speaker 1>several thousand fights at this point.</v>

66
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know how many it's been </v>
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>

67
00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.240
<v Speaker 1>It's been at least 1500 or something of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the best fights ever.</v>

68
00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.450
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you start seeing things over and </v>

69
00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.821
<v Speaker 1>over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And occasionally there's these outliers </v>

70
00:03:05.821 --> 00:03:10.650
<v Speaker 1>and these outliers are guys who just </v>
<v Speaker 1>have way more gas than anybody else.</v>

71
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.010
<v Speaker 1>Guys who have way more ability to push </v>
<v Speaker 1>deep into the fourth and fifth rounds </v>

72
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.230
<v Speaker 1>and you just wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how much of what we're seeing in </v>

73
00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.240
<v Speaker 1>terms of what a fighter can do inside </v>
<v Speaker 1>the octagon or inside the ring,</v>

74
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.270
<v Speaker 1>how much of it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much endurance they have.</v>

75
00:03:28.271 --> 00:03:31.030
<v Speaker 1>And I maintain that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a significant amount.</v>

76
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.770
<v Speaker 1>AbsoLutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>

77
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.950
<v Speaker 1>I think it's everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be 90 percent of it or </v>

78
00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.741
<v Speaker 1>something like that at least because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>seems like everybody is pretty skillful </v>

79
00:03:40.741 --> 00:03:45.210
<v Speaker 1>once they get to the upper levels of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ufc when you're dealing with a pedes or </v>

80
00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:47.800
<v Speaker 1>a dose on joe's or all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all across the board.</v>

81
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.620
<v Speaker 1>When you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you hit those high level guys,</v>

82
00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.860
<v Speaker 1>they're all very skillful and some are </v>
<v Speaker 1>better at certain aspects of fighting </v>

83
00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.041
<v Speaker 1>than other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it seems like the ones who can win </v>

84
00:03:59.041 --> 00:04:01.300
<v Speaker 1>and win the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way pedis and dos just went down the</v>

85
00:04:01.301 --> 00:04:03.020
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dos anjos just dominated paddocks,</v>

86
00:04:03.021 --> 00:04:08.021
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to have a fucking insane gas </v>

87
00:04:08.021 --> 00:04:08.021
<v Speaker 1>tank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

88
00:04:08.021 --> 00:04:12.370
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you've see my instagram </v>

89
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.370
<v Speaker 1>and seeing some of the videos I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

90
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.370
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

91
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:13.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fascinated by it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>

92
00:04:13.991 --> 00:04:15.580
<v Speaker 1>Rafael,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he first came to me,</v>

93
00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:21.090
<v Speaker 1>this was after the [inaudible] fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd tried several other strength and </v>

94
00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:22.720
<v Speaker 1>conditioning coaches as we came to me </v>
<v Speaker 1>about two or three workouts in.</v>

95
00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:23.290
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

96
00:04:23.291 --> 00:04:25.570
<v Speaker 1>this is already amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel the difference.</v>

97
00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.350
<v Speaker 1>And that's when I began to assess like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a longterm plan.</v>

98
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:35.010
<v Speaker 1>So like when I first get a new athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't just look at the immediate </v>

99
00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.010
<v Speaker 1>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look where I want,</v>

100
00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:39.451
<v Speaker 1>I want them to be about a year from now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six months from now and three or four </v>

101
00:04:39.451 --> 00:04:39.451
<v Speaker 1>fights from that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

102
00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.520
<v Speaker 1>But I kind of knew like some things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>were holding him back and areas that </v>

103
00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.090
<v Speaker 1>weren't trained properly that we needed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to rectify.</v>

104
00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.610
<v Speaker 1>What do you see when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you start working out with a guy,</v>

105
00:04:48.611 --> 00:04:50.670
<v Speaker 1>like how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you first of all realize it?</v>

106
00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:51.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'd like to do,</v>

107
00:04:51.821 --> 00:04:56.821
<v Speaker 1>like this is something that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>marinovich has did with bj penn was the </v>

108
00:04:56.821 --> 00:04:57.610
<v Speaker 1>first thing they did was they got a </v>
<v Speaker 1>heart rate monitor on them,</v>

109
00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.940
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they put them through sparring </v>

110
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.381
<v Speaker 1>to find out what areas tax them the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then that's what they would kind of </v>

111
00:05:04.381 --> 00:05:07.670
<v Speaker 1>designed the camp towards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if wrestling taxes you the most,</v>

112
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.300
<v Speaker 1>so that's the energy system we need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>train the most for you.</v>

113
00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:11.500
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

114
00:05:11.501 --> 00:05:16.501
<v Speaker 1>like with bj,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he never had any problem with his </v>

115
00:05:16.501 --> 00:05:18.541
<v Speaker 1>longterm arabic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was always as anaerobic energy </v>

116
00:05:18.541 --> 00:05:18.541
<v Speaker 1>systems.</v>

117
00:05:18.541 --> 00:05:19.640
<v Speaker 1>So it was always sprinting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

118
00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.570
<v Speaker 1>The big burst,</v>
<v Speaker 1>short burst and long bursts.</v>

119
00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:27.640
<v Speaker 1>So entire amount.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The issue was the recovery from short </v>

120
00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.640
<v Speaker 1>burst.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

121
00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:28.480
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

122
00:05:28.481 --> 00:05:29.510
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if,</v>

123
00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:34.530
<v Speaker 1>if your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if your anaerobic systems aren't chain </v>

124
00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.631
<v Speaker 1>properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you won't get that recovery in between </v>

125
00:05:36.631 --> 00:05:38.491
<v Speaker 1>the burst and some guys will go their </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire career without ever correcting </v>

126
00:05:38.491 --> 00:05:42.931
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're always exactly in this weird </v>

127
00:05:42.931 --> 00:05:43.510
<v Speaker 1>limbo state where you're scared to push </v>
<v Speaker 1>it too hard.</v>

128
00:05:43.511 --> 00:05:44.890
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

129
00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:50.190
<v Speaker 1>Now you take a guy like hoffeld dos </v>
<v Speaker 1>anjos that has beaten donald cerrone.</v>

130
00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:56.070
<v Speaker 1>So when he came to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's already world class one of the </v>

131
00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.341
<v Speaker 1>best fighters in the division,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was ranked 10th when I </v>

132
00:05:59.341 --> 00:05:59.341
<v Speaker 1>started with</v>

133
00:05:59.341 --> 00:05:59.341
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's a good fighter.</v>

134
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:02.270
<v Speaker 2>And that time we began training for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>roost.</v>

135
00:06:02.271 --> 00:06:07.271
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was scheduled to fight roost on copy </v>

136
00:06:07.271 --> 00:06:07.970
<v Speaker 2>of exactly and we did a pretty much a </v>
<v Speaker 2>full training camp.</v>

137
00:06:07.971 --> 00:06:12.971
<v Speaker 2>We did six weeks of training and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>colby law pulled out I think two weeks </v>

138
00:06:12.971 --> 00:06:15.080
<v Speaker 2>prior to the fight with a hurt finger or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

139
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:20.590
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so then we had a break for about three </v>

140
00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:21.170
<v Speaker 2>weeks in between and then he got the </v>
<v Speaker 2>news that he's gonna fight khabib.</v>

141
00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:26.120
<v Speaker 2>So he did another full training camp and</v>
<v Speaker 2>prior to the cubby fight I actually left</v>

142
00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:31.570
<v Speaker 2>for weeks before the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we stopped strength and conditioning </v>

143
00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:34.901
<v Speaker 2>for weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he missed the complete peak to peak </v>

144
00:06:34.901 --> 00:06:35.630
<v Speaker 2>fanny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a peak training phase of the,</v>

145
00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:40.760
<v Speaker 2>of the conditioning program.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's one of the reasons </v>

146
00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:40.760
<v Speaker 2>why you lost that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Partially.</v>

147
00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:45.681
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel a little bit of a responsibility </v>

148
00:06:45.681 --> 00:06:45.681
<v Speaker 2>for that.</v>

149
00:06:45.681 --> 00:06:45.681
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

150
00:06:45.681 --> 00:06:48.841
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>also you have to admit habib number </v>

151
00:06:48.841 --> 00:06:48.950
<v Speaker 2>grumet off is a fucking monster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is.</v>

152
00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:49.910
<v Speaker 2>He's a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a,</v>

153
00:06:49.911 --> 00:06:51.240
<v Speaker 2>he's a good fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

154
00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:54.410
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I hate to make excuses,</v>

155
00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:59.800
<v Speaker 2>but I think if people understood like </v>
<v Speaker 2>what referral went through before that </v>

156
00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.460
<v Speaker 2>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would be a little more accepting of</v>

157
00:07:01.461 --> 00:07:04.240
<v Speaker 2>the fact that he might kick khabib's ass</v>
<v Speaker 2>next time they fight.</v>

158
00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:10.260
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people are already saying </v>

159
00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:11.741
<v Speaker 2>kebabs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A new champion I did roughly almost had </v>

160
00:07:11.741 --> 00:07:14.321
<v Speaker 2>his fricking eye gouged out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>THe whites of his eyes like this was </v>

161
00:07:14.321 --> 00:07:18.011
<v Speaker 2>during the training camp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he had to take another couple of </v>

162
00:07:18.011 --> 00:07:18.011
<v Speaker 2>weeks off in the middle of the training </v>
<v Speaker 2>camp.</v>

163
00:07:18.011 --> 00:07:20.810
<v Speaker 2>The whites of his eyes were literally </v>
<v Speaker 2>hanging down from guys fingernails where</v>

164
00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:24.740
<v Speaker 2>he though they're sparring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they got poked his finger nails into his</v>

165
00:07:24.741 --> 00:07:29.741
<v Speaker 2>eyes and the whites of the eyes were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were stripped of it were hanging down </v>

166
00:07:29.741 --> 00:07:29.741
<v Speaker 2>below his eyelid.</v>

167
00:07:29.741 --> 00:07:29.990
<v Speaker 2>Oh god.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

168
00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:35.340
<v Speaker 2>And then so what they do to fix that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess they just trimmed it off and </v>

169
00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:35.960
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just turned it off.</v>

170
00:07:35.961 --> 00:07:37.000
<v Speaker 2>And then let.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

171
00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:42.520
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could trim the whites of your eye </v>

172
00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:42.520
<v Speaker 2>level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apparently.</v>

173
00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:42.650
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

174
00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:48.190
<v Speaker 2>Rafael is a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like people don't understand is because </v>

175
00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:49.130
<v Speaker 2>the guy had fingernails.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fingernails.</v>

176
00:07:49.131 --> 00:07:54.131
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's farming and he went to push </v>

177
00:07:54.131 --> 00:07:57.230
<v Speaker 2>them back or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two fingers went right into his eye and </v>

178
00:07:58.170 --> 00:07:58.980
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

179
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.730
<v Speaker 2>obviously he's not going to put that out</v>
<v Speaker 2>there on the internet and show people,</v>

180
00:08:01.731 --> 00:08:02.690
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at my fucked up.</v>

181
00:08:02.691 --> 00:08:06.530
<v Speaker 2>I or she should not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen his ear?</v>

182
00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:10.040
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you saw the picture of </v>
<v Speaker 2>his ear recent.</v>

183
00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:10.530
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

184
00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:12.500
<v Speaker 2>This is the same thing leading up to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>khabib fight.</v>

185
00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.930
<v Speaker 2>Prior to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his ear was ripped off in the cage.</v>

186
00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:20.320
<v Speaker 2>So it got stuck in between.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A couple of the links have seen that </v>

187
00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:21.230
<v Speaker 2>picture and his ear was hanging on by a </v>
<v Speaker 2>thread.</v>

188
00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:27.510
<v Speaker 2>It is jesus christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is all going on during training </v>

189
00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:28.340
<v Speaker 2>camp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

190
00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:31.700
<v Speaker 2>One thing after the other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I leave for weeks out.</v>

191
00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:35.780
<v Speaker 2>Not to mention he switched to a vegan </v>
<v Speaker 2>diet.</v>

192
00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:36.530
<v Speaker 2>What's?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

193
00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:37.910
<v Speaker 2>for that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why did he do that?</v>

194
00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:40.040
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea who told,</v>
<v Speaker 2>told him to do that.</v>

195
00:08:40.041 --> 00:08:43.130
<v Speaker 2>No idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have any response?</v>

196
00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:46.010
<v Speaker 2>I just ate vegan lunch by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So talking shit.</v>

197
00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:49.250
<v Speaker 2>I eat a lot of vegan food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talk a lot of shit about vegans,</v>

198
00:08:49.251 --> 00:08:50.350
<v Speaker 2>but my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

199
00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:55.620
<v Speaker 2>my diet consists mostly of vegan meals </v>
<v Speaker 2>and murdered animals are combined those </v>

200
00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:56.160
<v Speaker 2>two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty</v>

201
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.470
<v Speaker 3>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

202
00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:02.480
<v Speaker 3>I feel like you can't get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very difficult to get everything </v>

203
00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:06.441
<v Speaker 3>you need from just vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I feel like you really can't eat </v>

204
00:09:06.441 --> 00:09:09.861
<v Speaker 3>enough vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think vegetables are super important </v>

205
00:09:09.861 --> 00:09:10.200
<v Speaker 3>for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that it's one of the main issues</v>

206
00:09:10.201 --> 00:09:14.370
<v Speaker 3>that people suffer from when it comes to</v>
<v Speaker 3>health anD nutrition.</v>

207
00:09:14.371 --> 00:09:19.371
<v Speaker 3>even a lot of vegan people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they too much breads and pastas and rice</v>

208
00:09:19.771 --> 00:09:24.771
<v Speaker 3>and things along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think you need a lot of </v>

209
00:09:24.771 --> 00:09:26.931
<v Speaker 3>vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's super important for it to </v>

210
00:09:26.931 --> 00:09:26.931
<v Speaker 3>change is the way I think and feel.</v>

211
00:09:26.931 --> 00:09:27.350
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever tried to supplement called</v>
<v Speaker 2>dim?</v>

212
00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:28.820
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dim?</v>

213
00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:29.580
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is it?</v>

214
00:09:29.581 --> 00:09:32.550
<v Speaker 2>What does this diane doll me thinking?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

215
00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:36.920
<v Speaker 2>And it's supposedly like a concentration</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the cruciferous vegetables,</v>

216
00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:40.050
<v Speaker 2>but it helps lower like estrogen levels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scott phytoestrogen.</v>

217
00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:44.090
<v Speaker 2>So it helps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It helps your body metabolize estrogen.</v>

218
00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:46.400
<v Speaker 2>And I tell you what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it actually works.</v>

219
00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:48.740
<v Speaker 2>It gives you gnarly gas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it works.</v>

220
00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.620
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if I'm willing to make that</v>
<v Speaker 3>trade off.</v>

221
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:53.170
<v Speaker 3>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's worth it.</v>

222
00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:59.370
<v Speaker 3>Take it on an empty stomach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Back room.</v>

223
00:09:59.371 --> 00:10:01.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus.</v>

224
00:10:01.321 --> 00:10:02.280
<v Speaker 3>Crazily.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

225
00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:04.020
<v Speaker 3>Don't tell certain people that I know </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

226
00:10:04.021 --> 00:10:09.021
<v Speaker 3>Not blowing Farts on folks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other night my fiance and my baby </v>

227
00:10:09.021 --> 00:10:13.431
<v Speaker 3>woke me up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was laughing or that,</v>

228
00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.520
<v Speaker 3>that poop?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

229
00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:19.010
<v Speaker 3>it was very funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

230
00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:22.140
<v Speaker 3>so who talked a dos anjos into going </v>
<v Speaker 3>vegan?</v>

231
00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:23.130
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

232
00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:24.930
<v Speaker 2>I don't know to be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember.</v>

233
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:27.770
<v Speaker 2>I think he just kinda something he </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to try and his own and,</v>

234
00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.520
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you notice in that fight he looks</v>

235
00:10:29.521 --> 00:10:34.521
<v Speaker 2>quite a bit smaller too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like his shoulders look smaller and he </v>

236
00:10:34.521 --> 00:10:34.521
<v Speaker 2>looks</v>

237
00:10:34.521 --> 00:10:34.670
<v Speaker 3>loss of muscle mass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

238
00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:36.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some health benefits to eating a</v>

239
00:10:36.321 --> 00:10:37.610
<v Speaker 3>lot of vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't,</v>

240
00:10:37.611 --> 00:10:41.690
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's enough evidence to</v>
<v Speaker 3>promote veganism.</v>

241
00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:44.170
<v Speaker 3>I just don't think it's worth the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the,</v>

242
00:10:44.171 --> 00:10:47.960
<v Speaker 3>the tradeoff is too significant and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think your body,</v>

243
00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:53.010
<v Speaker 3>I mean we're omnivores,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just the way it is and especially </v>

244
00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:55.901
<v Speaker 3>when you're dealing with high level </v>
<v Speaker 3>athletes that are blowing down a lot of </v>

245
00:10:55.901 --> 00:11:00.581
<v Speaker 3>muscle tissue on a regular basis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a lot of recovery that needs to be </v>

246
00:11:00.581 --> 00:11:03.861
<v Speaker 3>done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're just a regular person going </v>

247
00:11:03.861 --> 00:11:03.861
<v Speaker 3>through life without any significant </v>
<v Speaker 3>stress on your body,</v>

248
00:11:03.861 --> 00:11:04.420
<v Speaker 3>you probably can get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get through,</v>

249
00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:09.490
<v Speaker 3>fine with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think for high level athletes are </v>

250
00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:09.590
<v Speaker 3>very difficult to find a vegan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>high level athlete,</v>

251
00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:12.050
<v Speaker 3>especially in an explosive combat </v>
<v Speaker 3>sports.</v>

252
00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:17.930
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you don't have anything to do with </v>

253
00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:17.930
<v Speaker 3>the diet stuff.</v>

254
00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:17.930
<v Speaker 2>If a guy needs my help,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then yeah,</v>

255
00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:22.891
<v Speaker 2>I'll do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But a lot of these guys now have </v>

256
00:11:22.891 --> 00:11:24.361
<v Speaker 2>nutritionist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that kind of takes a lot of work off </v>

257
00:11:24.361 --> 00:11:24.430
<v Speaker 2>of my back workload off my back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

258
00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:28.940
<v Speaker 3>it's funny because fighters have a short</v>
<v Speaker 3>window of time to be the best,</v>

259
00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:31.340
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean a fighter's career,</v>

260
00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:34.970
<v Speaker 3>like somebodY pointed it out once,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was on mixed martial arts.com</v>

261
00:11:34.971 --> 00:11:38.690
<v Speaker 3>that there's like a nine year period </v>
<v Speaker 3>where a guy can really fight great.</v>

262
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:40.040
<v Speaker 3>RIght.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then after that,</v>

263
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:45.550
<v Speaker 3>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the wheels just sorta start to fall off </v>

264
00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:45.800
<v Speaker 3>and just the body can only take so much </v>
<v Speaker 3>finding.</v>

265
00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:48.110
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think that's a mental Thing though?</v>

266
00:11:48.111 --> 00:11:49.910
<v Speaker 2>Do you think they get too comfortable </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they loSe it?</v>

267
00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:52.520
<v Speaker 2>It's possible thAt I think that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

268
00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:56.710
<v Speaker 2>I think why gsp quit at the right time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

269
00:11:56.770 --> 00:12:01.770
<v Speaker 2>He's got all these like gq magazine </v>
<v Speaker 2>things coming up and I don't know how </v>

270
00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:02.470
<v Speaker 2>much money that guy's work now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he doesn't need to fight.</v>

271
00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:04.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe the same thing happened with bj.</v>

272
00:12:04.481 --> 00:12:06.760
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he quit a little too late,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

273
00:12:06.761 --> 00:12:09.380
<v Speaker 2>I think once they get too comfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think then it's,</v>

274
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:09.830
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

275
00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:11.760
<v Speaker 3>Silver.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is possible.</v>

276
00:12:11.761 --> 00:12:16.380
<v Speaker 3>I think the mental strain of camps is </v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely brutal on these guys.</v>

277
00:12:16.381 --> 00:12:18.660
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would know as good as anybody,</v>

278
00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:19.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

279
00:12:19.781 --> 00:12:24.781
<v Speaker 3>I've been to high level training camps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've watched guys go out and I've </v>

280
00:12:24.781 --> 00:12:26.820
<v Speaker 3>watched guys go do their strength and </v>
<v Speaker 3>conditioning routines and it's fucking,</v>

281
00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:32.170
<v Speaker 3>it's an ungodly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I barely can get through a fucking yoga </v>

282
00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:32.170
<v Speaker 3>class,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

283
00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:35.840
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these guys are doing two a days and </v>

284
00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:35.840
<v Speaker 3>strength and conditioning in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>morning,</v>

285
00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:38.480
<v Speaker 3>beating the fuck out of each other at </v>
<v Speaker 3>night and going home and exhausted.</v>

286
00:12:38.481 --> 00:12:43.481
<v Speaker 3>And then one of the things that bj said </v>
<v Speaker 3>about training with the marinda bitches </v>

287
00:12:43.481 --> 00:12:43.560
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was just too much.</v>

288
00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:46.410
<v Speaker 3>Like his performances were legendary,</v>

289
00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:48.280
<v Speaker 2>legendary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So was,</v>

290
00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:50.690
<v Speaker 2>was it the training really too much read</v>
<v Speaker 2>bj had enough.</v>

291
00:12:50.691 --> 00:12:51.920
<v Speaker 2>that's the question to ask.</v>

292
00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:53.810
<v Speaker 3>That's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

293
00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:57.710
<v Speaker 3>By the time the has got a hold of him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'd already had a 10 plus year career.</v>

294
00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:59.030
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

295
00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:01.220
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You look at that diego sanchez fight,</v>

296
00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:04.370
<v Speaker 3>I maintain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's very few people ever that fought</v>

297
00:13:04.371 --> 00:13:09.371
<v Speaker 3>at 1:55.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could fuck with bj when he was in </v>

298
00:13:09.371 --> 00:13:09.830
<v Speaker 3>that mode.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Goddamn he waS a killer.</v>

299
00:13:09.831 --> 00:13:10.290
<v Speaker 3>That.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

300
00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:14.900
<v Speaker 2>It's funny because I just talked to </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] about this the other day.</v>

301
00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:16.100
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

302
00:13:16.101 --> 00:13:21.101
<v Speaker 2>just to clarify why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happened with us and it came down </v>

303
00:13:21.101 --> 00:13:24.761
<v Speaker 2>to what gary explained to me was they'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>reached a point in training where they </v>

304
00:13:24.761 --> 00:13:25.430
<v Speaker 2>were doing their strength training in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the morning.</v>

305
00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:30.850
<v Speaker 2>Then they had the spine was going on in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the afternoons and pj approach them and </v>

306
00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:35.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't like a dick about it or </v>

307
00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:35.890
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's totally cool.</v>

308
00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:35.890
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

309
00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:35.890
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

310
00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:37.830
<v Speaker 2>how would you guys feel if we did the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

311
00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:40.970
<v Speaker 2>strength training on another day so that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can do my sparring,</v>

312
00:13:40.971 --> 00:13:42.230
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm fresh for sparring.</v>

313
00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:45.620
<v Speaker 2>And I think marvin gary took that as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

314
00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:51.250
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't ready for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't at that level yet or they're </v>

315
00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:51.250
<v Speaker 2>ready to back off the air conditioning </v>
<v Speaker 2>training.</v>

316
00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:56.560
<v Speaker 2>They don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I mean there's a method behind their </v>

317
00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:59.351
<v Speaker 2>training and it's very rational.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think the fact that he was </v>

318
00:13:59.351 --> 00:13:59.750
<v Speaker 2>questioning them at that point was just </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

319
00:13:59.751 --> 00:14:01.400
<v Speaker 2>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe there's some other stuff goIng on.</v>

320
00:14:01.401 --> 00:14:06.401
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think the questioning of their </v>

321
00:14:06.401 --> 00:14:11.050
<v Speaker 2>abilities as trainers at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like as if they didn't know what they </v>

322
00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:12.610
<v Speaker 2>were doing was enough to turn them off </v>
<v Speaker 2>and kinda well wish.</v>

323
00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:16.130
<v Speaker 3>I think what the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mindset of fighters when it comes to</v>

324
00:14:16.131 --> 00:14:21.131
<v Speaker 3>strength conditioning versus versus </v>
<v Speaker 3>skill work is that it's very important </v>

325
00:14:21.891 --> 00:14:25.250
<v Speaker 3>to stay sharp with the skill work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very difficult to do that if you're</v>

326
00:14:25.251 --> 00:14:27.200
<v Speaker 3>already exhausted from strength and </v>
<v Speaker 3>conditioning.</v>

327
00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:29.090
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how do you find that balance?</v>

328
00:14:29.091 --> 00:14:34.091
<v Speaker 3>Is it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it smarter to do the skill work in </v>

329
00:14:34.091 --> 00:14:36.851
<v Speaker 3>the morning and then the strength and </v>
<v Speaker 3>conditioning later on the evening or </v>

330
00:14:36.851 --> 00:14:36.851
<v Speaker 3>like how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you,</v>

331
00:14:36.851 --> 00:14:40.670
<v Speaker 3>how do you find that balance?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are we talking about in general here?</v>

332
00:14:40.671 --> 00:14:42.820
<v Speaker 3>Are we talking about general?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I would perceive for,</v>

333
00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:47.320
<v Speaker 3>for bj either are either we're like if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I was closer and closer to my side,</v>

334
00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:49.110
<v Speaker 3>if I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a,</v>

335
00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:51.980
<v Speaker 3>I probably would've done the same thIng </v>
<v Speaker 3>and maybe</v>

336
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:54.440
<v Speaker 2>tone down the sparring a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>already.</v>

337
00:14:54.441 --> 00:14:59.441
<v Speaker 2>Phenomenally skilled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe the one of the most skilled </v>

338
00:14:59.441 --> 00:14:59.840
<v Speaker 2>fighters we've ever seen in the ufc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a fan of his before.</v>

339
00:14:59.841 --> 00:15:04.841
<v Speaker 2>He was even in the ufc,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told people this dude when I saw him </v>

340
00:15:04.841 --> 00:15:05.630
<v Speaker 2>at tournament's as a blue belt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>black belt in jujitsu,</v>

341
00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:06.710
<v Speaker 2>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

342
00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:10.490
<v Speaker 2>so I've seen these guys from the start.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

343
00:15:10.491 --> 00:15:12.020
<v Speaker 2>this kid's going to be freaking </v>
<v Speaker 2>phenomenal.</v>

344
00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:14.840
<v Speaker 2>You said the same thing about nick diaz </v>
<v Speaker 2>two years ago,</v>

345
00:15:14.841 --> 00:15:16.040
<v Speaker 2>and I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he was a purple belt,</v>

346
00:15:16.041 --> 00:15:17.840
<v Speaker 2>I'd seen him at tournament.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a blue belt even.</v>

347
00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:19.160
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy,</v>

348
00:15:19.161 --> 00:15:24.161
<v Speaker 2>when he gets you watch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going to be a fighter and he's </v>

349
00:15:24.161 --> 00:15:24.161
<v Speaker 2>going to be phenomenal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like tear these guys up.</v>

350
00:15:24.161 --> 00:15:27.680
<v Speaker 2>So pj skill has never been in question </v>
<v Speaker 2>right there that tells you,</v>

351
00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:32.740
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>conditioning has always been the issue </v>

352
00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:32.740
<v Speaker 2>with bj.</v>

353
00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:33.710
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen him outclass like skill </v>
<v Speaker 2>wise by anybody,</v>

354
00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:39.210
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's always been a strength and </v>

355
00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:39.210
<v Speaker 2>conditioning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

356
00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:39.210
<v Speaker 2>that's costume.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His fights.</v>

357
00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:41.450
<v Speaker 2>What did you think when you saw his last</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight with frankie edgar?</v>

358
00:15:41.451 --> 00:15:46.451
<v Speaker 2>Would he adopted that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very strange blown away at how stupid </v>

359
00:15:46.451 --> 00:15:46.451
<v Speaker 2>that was?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

360
00:15:46.451 --> 00:15:47.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean that was just ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like why would you.</v>

361
00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:52.660
<v Speaker 2>You're pretty much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just had this conversation with </v>

362
00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:55.121
<v Speaker 2>freddie roach about a month ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>he told me bj penn was one of the best </v>

363
00:15:55.121 --> 00:15:58.271
<v Speaker 2>boxers he's ever trained.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really like even out of the boxers in </v>

364
00:15:58.271 --> 00:16:01.241
<v Speaker 2>the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bj penn was one of the best natural </v>

365
00:16:01.241 --> 00:16:01.241
<v Speaker 2>boxers he's ever trained for folks who </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know what</v>

366
00:16:01.241 --> 00:16:06.120
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bj had adopted this very strange style </v>

367
00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:09.570
<v Speaker 3>that I'd never seen before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas feet were very close together </v>

368
00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:11.260
<v Speaker 3>and he was just moving really ending up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

369
00:16:11.261 --> 00:16:16.261
<v Speaker 3>Like iT's a raf almost completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>straight up instead of like the classic </v>

370
00:16:16.261 --> 00:16:19.210
<v Speaker 3>style of a stand up fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's various it,</v>

371
00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:22.960
<v Speaker 3>there's variables when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 3>standup fighting for mma because you,</v>

372
00:16:22.961 --> 00:16:27.961
<v Speaker 3>you have a more squared off stance </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you want to have your hips in </v>

373
00:16:27.961 --> 00:16:30.751
<v Speaker 3>place to take down defense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the classic stances shoulders or a </v>

374
00:16:30.751 --> 00:16:33.610
<v Speaker 3>pi hands are right by the face,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

375
00:16:33.611 --> 00:16:38.030
<v Speaker 3>head movement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bj did this weird thing where it just,</v>

376
00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:43.080
<v Speaker 3>he looked like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like almost like a guy playing </v>

377
00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:47.250
<v Speaker 3>pretending to be a fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he was doing this weird and he had </v>

378
00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:48.100
<v Speaker 3>said afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which really bothered me.</v>

379
00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:50.410
<v Speaker 3>He said that he did it to conserve </v>
<v Speaker 3>energy.</v>

380
00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:53.540
<v Speaker 2>That is again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>conserved energy.</v>

381
00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:58.570
<v Speaker 2>There it is again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought he said because his trainers </v>

382
00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:00.500
<v Speaker 2>really felt that he generated more </v>
<v Speaker 2>forced that way.</v>

383
00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:03.410
<v Speaker 2>There's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's insane,</v>

384
00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:07.700
<v Speaker 2>but I love whatever conditions there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't need to worry about concerns.</v>

385
00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:08.910
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

386
00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:14.780
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what was the consensus that made them</v>

387
00:17:14.781 --> 00:17:19.781
<v Speaker 2>part ways because the performances that </v>
<v Speaker 2>he put on with them or individuals war </v>

388
00:17:19.781 --> 00:17:21.830
<v Speaker 2>legendary really work some of the best </v>
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>

389
00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:26.890
<v Speaker 2>WhAt was it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It florian and then they did the diego </v>

390
00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:30.401
<v Speaker 2>sanchez fight and then they left about </v>
<v Speaker 2>five weeks out from the frankie edgar </v>

391
00:17:30.401 --> 00:17:31.310
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

392
00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:36.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So five weeks at this type of training </v>

393
00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:36.370
<v Speaker 2>needs to be done pretty much up until </v>
<v Speaker 2>the day of the fight.</v>

394
00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:38.570
<v Speaker 2>So they did train him a little bit for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the frankie edgar,</v>

395
00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:43.900
<v Speaker 2>three weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe four weeks at the most and what </v>

396
00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:45.971
<v Speaker 2>happened and that's when they had the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dIscussion about changing up the </v>

397
00:17:45.971 --> 00:17:49.901
<v Speaker 2>program,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a can we do the conditioning on </v>

398
00:17:49.901 --> 00:17:50.190
<v Speaker 2>different days and so they just decided</v>

399
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:51.060
<v Speaker 1>to walk away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

400
00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:56.360
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just felt it wasn't going the way </v>

401
00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:56.640
<v Speaker 1>they want it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

402
00:17:56.641 --> 00:17:57.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they were.</v>

403
00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.990
<v Speaker 1>They respected frankie edgar is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy's going to be trouble.</v>

404
00:18:00.991 --> 00:18:03.240
<v Speaker 1>This guy's coming to fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has got a gas tank.</v>

405
00:18:03.241 --> 00:18:05.010
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's no pushover,</v>

406
00:18:05.011 --> 00:18:06.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and who's a motherfucker.</v>

407
00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:12.020
<v Speaker 1>He's a relentless motherfucker which </v>
<v Speaker 1>shows you how god damn good uriah </v>

408
00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:12.060
<v Speaker 1>favorites because they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

409
00:18:12.061 --> 00:18:17.061
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your rise to fighting one weight class </v>

410
00:18:17.061 --> 00:18:17.061
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

411
00:18:17.061 --> 00:18:17.061
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>usually fights it.</v>

412
00:18:17.061 --> 00:18:17.910
<v Speaker 1>One 35 finding 1:45</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>

413
00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:21.990
<v Speaker 1>they went five rounds and I mean frankie</v>
<v Speaker 1>won a decision,</v>

414
00:18:21.991 --> 00:18:24.840
<v Speaker 1>but there was no point in that fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>where he was going to finish your Ohio.</v>

415
00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:27.180
<v Speaker 1>No point where you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in significant trouble,</v>

416
00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:32.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were pretty much gone blow for </v>

417
00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:34.161
<v Speaker 1>blow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but frankie was getting an edge and </v>

418
00:18:34.161 --> 00:18:36.611
<v Speaker 1>basically every round,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think frankie is one of the best </v>

419
00:18:36.611 --> 00:18:40.551
<v Speaker 1>condition guys and I would love to find </v>
<v Speaker 1>out what he does for his strength and </v>

420
00:18:40.551 --> 00:18:41.400
<v Speaker 1>conditioning because he's never fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>tired.</v>

421
00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:44.550
<v Speaker 1>He's always able to push that same pace </v>
<v Speaker 1>every round.</v>

422
00:18:44.551 --> 00:18:49.551
<v Speaker 1>And that seems to be what separates the </v>
<v Speaker 1>greats that truly grades from everybody </v>

423
00:18:49.561 --> 00:18:50.370
<v Speaker 1>else underneath them.</v>

424
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:51.170
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's funny.</v>

425
00:18:51.171 --> 00:18:54.500
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of people are talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the dust angeles pettis fight,</v>

426
00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:57.620
<v Speaker 2>but between me and the yield and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rest of the world,</v>

427
00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:01.370
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rafael is in better conditioning,</v>

428
00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:03.800
<v Speaker 2>better shape for the benson henderson </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>

429
00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:04.820
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

430
00:19:04.821 --> 00:19:06.290
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't a fight.</v>

431
00:19:06.291 --> 00:19:10.220
<v Speaker 2>He was injured so three weeks out he </v>
<v Speaker 2>injured his knee and aspiring accident.</v>

432
00:19:10.221 --> 00:19:13.220
<v Speaker 2>And so we had to change things up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We couldn't do any more field work,</v>

433
00:19:13.221 --> 00:19:15.080
<v Speaker 2>we couldn't do any writing or anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

434
00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:18.650
<v Speaker 2>So we had to kind of modify it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's when you see,</v>

435
00:19:18.651 --> 00:19:23.651
<v Speaker 2>I got them during the sprints on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>airdyne bicycle and only pretty much </v>

436
00:19:23.651 --> 00:19:23.870
<v Speaker 2>something safe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

437
00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:26.870
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I had him at like 12,000</v>

438
00:19:26.871 --> 00:19:29.600
<v Speaker 2>feet elevation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gradually built them up to that.</v>

439
00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:30.590
<v Speaker 2>so we're at high altitude</v>

440
00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:34.280
<v Speaker 1>to the benson henderson fight was </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly impressive because he was the</v>

441
00:19:34.281 --> 00:19:39.281
<v Speaker 1>first guy to ever stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Benson was strikes and benson is just </v>

442
00:19:39.281 --> 00:19:41.270
<v Speaker 1>notoriously durable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably tough,</v>

443
00:19:41.271 --> 00:19:45.240
<v Speaker 1>big for the weight class and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and dos anjos just jumped all over him.</v>

444
00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:47.450
<v Speaker 1>He had destroyed him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a big fight.</v>

445
00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:48.840
<v Speaker 1>It was a big like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

446
00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:51.020
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy's on another level right now.</v>

447
00:19:51.021 --> 00:19:56.021
<v Speaker 1>That's why it kind of blew my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like why people pay to keep reminding </v>

448
00:19:56.021 --> 00:19:56.021
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it closer to get sentenced.</v>

449
00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:57.560
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sounds good to us,</v>

450
00:19:57.710 --> 00:19:59.620
<v Speaker 1>but the recording is weird.</v>

451
00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:00.800
<v Speaker 2>I got you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

452
00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:03.590
<v Speaker 1>Don't need to repeat anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

453
00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:05.300
<v Speaker 1>it's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

454
00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:06.450
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

455
00:20:06.451 --> 00:20:09.570
<v Speaker 1>I think he was in better shape for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the benson henderson fight,</v>

456
00:20:09.571 --> 00:20:14.571
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why people couldn't see </v>

457
00:20:14.571 --> 00:20:14.571
<v Speaker 1>this coming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

463
00:20:23.281 --> 00:20:25.140
<v Speaker 1>He's fucking big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a big.</v>

464
00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:26.790
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a good size one.</v>

465
00:20:26.791 --> 00:20:27.750
<v Speaker 1>80 five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

466
00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:31.470
<v Speaker 1>and as a seventies fucking huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And benson handled him.</v>

467
00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:33.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think people just thought,</v>

468
00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:35.190
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a great fight.</v>

469
00:20:35.191 --> 00:20:38.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't necessarily count dosantos out,</v>

470
00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:42.540
<v Speaker 1>but I certainly didn't think he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna stop them the way you just fucking</v>

471
00:20:42.541 --> 00:20:43.530
<v Speaker 1>beat his ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

472
00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:48.920
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was gonna be a really good </v>

473
00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:48.920
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I thought.</v>

474
00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:48.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean</v>

475
00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:51.610
<v Speaker 3>hence pharma champion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>been there with some of the best ever.</v>

476
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.000
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've thought this is gonna be a great </v>

477
00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:57.000
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>

478
00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:57.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's interesting.</v>

479
00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.641
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kinda knew like at the end of the </v>

480
00:20:59.641 --> 00:20:59.641
<v Speaker 2>training camp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the different sites,</v>

481
00:20:59.641 --> 00:21:04.080
<v Speaker 2>the difference we've made in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>training camp in terms of speed and </v>

482
00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:07.441
<v Speaker 2>power and his stamina.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just knew like I knew where he was </v>

483
00:21:07.441 --> 00:21:09.640
<v Speaker 2>before and I knew where he was after and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said he's just going to destroy him.</v>

484
00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:14.840
<v Speaker 2>Like I hope I almost wanted it to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>five rounds so he could show like what </v>

485
00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:15.640
<v Speaker 2>it was capable of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

486
00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:18.210
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's pretty crazy that he,</v>

487
00:21:18.211 --> 00:21:23.211
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we found out after the pettis </v>

488
00:21:23.211 --> 00:21:25.221
<v Speaker 3>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where he won the title and just one by </v>

489
00:21:25.221 --> 00:21:28.140
<v Speaker 3>just dominating the champion and a guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>who dana white had been pretty public </v>

490
00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:31.080
<v Speaker 3>saying he thought was the best pound for</v>
<v Speaker 3>pound fighter in the sport.</v>

491
00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:33.060
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't,</v>

492
00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:38.120
<v Speaker 3>I didn't agree with that necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'd certainly did take the kid was </v>

493
00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:38.120
<v Speaker 3>spectacular.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

494
00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:39.090
<v Speaker 3>the way he stopped donald cerrone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the waist up,</v>

495
00:21:39.091 --> 00:21:41.790
<v Speaker 3>joe lozan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he was capable of just unleashing</v>

496
00:21:41.791 --> 00:21:44.940
<v Speaker 3>these kicks out of nowhere to put people</v>
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>

497
00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:48.150
<v Speaker 3>He just fucking good way arm barred </v>
<v Speaker 3>benson.</v>

498
00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:53.390
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's just in the way he caught </v>
<v Speaker 3>gilbert to mean called gIlbert and good </v>

499
00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:53.390
<v Speaker 3>team.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's fucking good.</v>

500
00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:54.150
<v Speaker 3>And you think he</v>

501
00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:55.990
<v Speaker 2>gilbert in that or do you think it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost.</v>

502
00:21:56.110 --> 00:22:01.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not saying that fight was rig or </v>

503
00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:01.110
<v Speaker 2>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but gilbert made a terrible mistake.</v>

504
00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:01.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's sitting on his knees with </v>
<v Speaker 2>his head up.</v>

505
00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:02.760
<v Speaker 2>He had been tagged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

506
00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:03.550
<v Speaker 2>that's what it was.</v>

507
00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:05.030
<v Speaker 3>Been hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

508
00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:07.530
<v Speaker 3>if you watch that fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've watched it several times.</v>

509
00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:12.770
<v Speaker 3>A pet his had caught him several times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some pretty hard shots when gilbert was </v>

510
00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:13.690
<v Speaker 3>coming in because he knew gilbert </v>
<v Speaker 3>strategy was.</v>

511
00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:18.820
<v Speaker 3>It was no secret.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gilbert was just gonna stay on the </v>

512
00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:18.990
<v Speaker 3>outside a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>press hIm up against the cage.</v>

513
00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:21.570
<v Speaker 3>Who's this to the clay guido strategy </v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially.</v>

514
00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:22.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was.</v>

515
00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:24.160
<v Speaker 3>Which was his first loss.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

516
00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:26.130
<v Speaker 3>that was pegasys first loss in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>octagon.</v>

517
00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:29.430
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he first came to the ufc,</v>

518
00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:32.850
<v Speaker 3>he was the wec champion and clay gui to </v>
<v Speaker 3>beat him.</v>

519
00:22:32.851 --> 00:22:33.540
<v Speaker 3>And everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

520
00:22:33.541 --> 00:22:35.610
<v Speaker 3>welcome to the ufc dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

521
00:22:35.611 --> 00:22:37.260
<v Speaker 3>And everybody kind of knew,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

522
00:22:37.261 --> 00:22:42.261
<v Speaker 3>well this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least at this stage of his career is </v>

523
00:22:42.261 --> 00:22:43.380
<v Speaker 3>vulnerable to something like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

524
00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:48.870
<v Speaker 3>But gilbert just didn't have the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>tools that dosantos house until sandra </v>

525
00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:50.040
<v Speaker 3>says much faster,</v>
<v Speaker 3>much faster.</v>

526
00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:51.330
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a fucking.</v>

527
00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:53.430
<v Speaker 3>He's a dangerous dangerous right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

528
00:22:53.431 --> 00:22:58.431
<v Speaker 3>he's extremely dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And his conditioning was off the charts </v>

529
00:22:58.431 --> 00:23:02.751
<v Speaker 3>and then when you tell me that he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>knee was hurt three weeks out and he </v>

530
00:23:02.751 --> 00:23:02.751
<v Speaker 3>couldn't do anything but airdyne </v>
<v Speaker 3>sprints.</v>

531
00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:04.680
<v Speaker 3>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

532
00:23:04.681 --> 00:23:05.370
<v Speaker 3>that's amazing.</v>

533
00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:07.180
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're at high altitudes,</v>

534
00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:08.870
<v Speaker 2>so that's pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

535
00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:10.400
<v Speaker 2>how's he doing it at a highlight?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have the,</v>

536
00:23:10.401 --> 00:23:13.790
<v Speaker 2>I have an altitude simulator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have the hypoxic altitude simulator,</v>

537
00:23:13.791 --> 00:23:18.791
<v Speaker 2>not the little velcro masks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is the actual one that thins </v>

538
00:23:18.791 --> 00:23:19.640
<v Speaker 2>the air and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and changes your blood oxygen levels.</v>

539
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:25.000
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it takes time to build up to </v>

540
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:25.000
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't recommend anyone go try it at</v>

541
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:25.430
<v Speaker 2>12,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>feet right now.</v>

542
00:23:25.431 --> 00:23:26.990
<v Speaker 2>You're going to have like a seizure or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

543
00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:28.910
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I aneurism,</v>

544
00:23:28.911 --> 00:23:33.911
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it took probably three weeks to get </v>

545
00:23:33.911 --> 00:23:35.840
<v Speaker 2>them to that point where he was able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>sprint on that thing.</v>

546
00:23:35.841 --> 00:23:40.841
<v Speaker 2>So I mean we'd been building up for </v>
<v Speaker 2>awhile and then there's things.</v>

547
00:23:41.031 --> 00:23:46.031
<v Speaker 2>Obviously I can't tell you on the air </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I don't give away too many </v>

548
00:23:46.031 --> 00:23:46.160
<v Speaker 2>people that I tell</v>

549
00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:51.160
<v Speaker 1>you it was rigorous and there was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was times when I would watch and </v>

550
00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:51.980
<v Speaker 1>I'd want to pull the plug and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

551
00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:54.080
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you gotta listen to your gut.</v>

552
00:23:54.550 --> 00:23:59.550
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just keep pushing them and know what </v>

553
00:23:59.550 --> 00:23:59.550
<v Speaker 1>they can take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that a factor,</v>

554
00:23:59.550 --> 00:24:03.611
<v Speaker 1>a big factor when you're working with an</v>
<v Speaker 1>athlete that you have to know what this </v>

555
00:24:03.611 --> 00:24:05.690
<v Speaker 1>athlete is capable of and where were you</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to break them that?</v>

556
00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:10.710
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's probably the most </v>

557
00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:12.491
<v Speaker 1>critical factor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you hit it right on the head </v>

558
00:24:12.491 --> 00:24:13.430
<v Speaker 1>because it seems like you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're dancing that line,</v>

559
00:24:13.431 --> 00:24:18.431
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a thin line man and that's the </v>

560
00:24:18.431 --> 00:24:18.431
<v Speaker 1>way you get a guy better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

561
00:24:18.431 --> 00:24:19.790
<v Speaker 1>You gotta get them right to that fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>ads and then pull them back.</v>

562
00:24:19.791 --> 00:24:21.620
<v Speaker 1>How have you seen the movie whiplash?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

563
00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:24.020
<v Speaker 1>That's basically sums it up.</v>

564
00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:29.020
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that teacher was so good at </v>

565
00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:29.020
<v Speaker 1>what he did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He brought out the best.</v>

566
00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:32.120
<v Speaker 1>I've got the wrong move in my head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about the movie.</v>

567
00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:35.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't tell me about it,</v>

568
00:24:35.181 --> 00:24:37.400
<v Speaker 1>but I saw the ads are screaming and </v>
<v Speaker 1>yelling at somebody.</v>

569
00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:39.830
<v Speaker 1>I was confused.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

570
00:24:39.831 --> 00:24:44.831
<v Speaker 1>how does that factor in?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the thing in a totally </v>

571
00:24:44.831 --> 00:24:44.831
<v Speaker 1>different movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is,</v>

572
00:24:44.831 --> 00:24:44.831
<v Speaker 1>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

573
00:24:44.831 --> 00:24:48.490
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

574
00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:50.790
<v Speaker 1>is he going to make this a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

575
00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:54.530
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's it.</v>

576
00:24:54.531 --> 00:24:59.531
<v Speaker 1>The intuition and the I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that I as the most important </v>

577
00:24:59.531 --> 00:24:59.960
<v Speaker 1>in what you see and what your athletes </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>

578
00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:02.810
<v Speaker 1>you see the speed deteriorate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you've gone too far.</v>

579
00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:08.330
<v Speaker 1>You need to know how to get your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got a peak In every exercise and then </v>

580
00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:11.891
<v Speaker 1>cut it off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's the variability as far as </v>

581
00:25:11.891 --> 00:25:11.891
<v Speaker 1>recovery?</v>

582
00:25:11.891 --> 00:25:11.891
<v Speaker 1>Does everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

583
00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:14.450
<v Speaker 1>people must recover at different rates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

584
00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:19.840
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it also depends on their past like </v>

585
00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:19.840
<v Speaker 1>conditioning too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

586
00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:23.711
<v Speaker 1>So like if a guy's never had a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>type of aerobic or anaerobic training </v>

587
00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:27.050
<v Speaker 1>and of course it's going to take a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>more days to recover,</v>

588
00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:28.820
<v Speaker 1>that's going to take a lot longer to </v>
<v Speaker 1>develop.</v>

589
00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:31.430
<v Speaker 1>That was one of the things that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>arrive,</v>

590
00:25:31.431 --> 00:25:34.670
<v Speaker 1>faber said was one of the reasons why </v>
<v Speaker 1>his team,</v>

591
00:25:34.671 --> 00:25:39.671
<v Speaker 1>the team alpha male has so few injuries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like there's some camps that have </v>

592
00:25:39.671 --> 00:25:41.970
<v Speaker 1>amazing records,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

593
00:25:41.971 --> 00:25:44.220
<v Speaker 1>as far as their fighters fighters when </v>
<v Speaker 1>grape,</v>

594
00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:46.820
<v Speaker 1>but they have a giant amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>injuries.</v>

595
00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:48.860
<v Speaker 1>But his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his camp team,</v>

596
00:25:48.861 --> 00:25:50.330
<v Speaker 1>alpha male,</v>
<v Speaker 1>occasionally guys get hurt.</v>

597
00:25:50.331 --> 00:25:53.570
<v Speaker 1>LIke tj had to pull out of the head and </v>
<v Speaker 1>brow fight because of a broken rib,</v>

598
00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:56.900
<v Speaker 1>but those are just bones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like you can only take so much.</v>

599
00:25:56.900 --> 00:26:01.900
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your bone is like benevidez said it </v>

600
00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:01.900
<v Speaker 1>best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like a rib at the end of the day is</v>

601
00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:04.040
<v Speaker 1>just a rib and it can only take so much </v>
<v Speaker 1>and when it breaks it breaks.</v>

602
00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:06.980
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but those guys are always in shape.</v>

603
00:26:06.981 --> 00:26:11.981
<v Speaker 1>And you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was saying that it's like a lifestyle </v>

604
00:26:11.981 --> 00:26:11.981
<v Speaker 1>thing that they never get out of shape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're always training very hard.</v>

605
00:26:11.981 --> 00:26:14.600
<v Speaker 1>They're always in peak condition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not about getting,</v>

606
00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:16.820
<v Speaker 1>having to get into shape already in </v>
<v Speaker 1>shape.</v>

607
00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:21.970
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd also wonder what kind of strength </v>

608
00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:21.970
<v Speaker 1>and strength training they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to this day,</v>

609
00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:25.541
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're doing heavy weight lifting </v>

610
00:26:25.541 --> 00:26:25.541
<v Speaker 1>and you're doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're around,</v>

611
00:26:25.541 --> 00:26:25.700
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just going to happen.</v>

612
00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:29.780
<v Speaker 1>It destroys the muscular equilibrium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's been proven.</v>

613
00:26:29.781 --> 00:26:34.781
<v Speaker 1>So if he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you got a good program and it helps </v>

614
00:26:35.001 --> 00:26:38.230
<v Speaker 1>maintain the health of the athletes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that's something.</v>

615
00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:43.540
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you say that heavy weightlifting </v>

616
00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:43.950
<v Speaker 1>destroys the equilibrium of the athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would exactly do you mean by.</v>

617
00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:49.090
<v Speaker 2>so what I mean by that is let's say a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say you're doing bicep curls for </v>

618
00:26:49.090 --> 00:26:50.050
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're.</v>

619
00:26:50.051 --> 00:26:53.400
<v Speaker 2>You're doing a heavy weight lifting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing heavy bicep curls,</v>

620
00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:58.020
<v Speaker 2>you're shortening that bicep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

621
00:26:58.650 --> 00:27:00.060
<v Speaker 2>We know the one that has a muscle gets </v>
<v Speaker 2>bigger,</v>

622
00:27:00.061 --> 00:27:01.860
<v Speaker 2>it gets shorter because of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cross-bridging.</v>

623
00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:07.370
<v Speaker 2>So when you shorten one muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you lengthen the opposite muscle and </v>

624
00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:09.120
<v Speaker 2>that puts the joint and the tendons and </v>
<v Speaker 2>ligaments are at risk for injury.</v>

625
00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:12.040
<v Speaker 3>Hm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you do like,</v>

626
00:27:12.041 --> 00:27:14.290
<v Speaker 3>say if you're doing something along the </v>
<v Speaker 3>lines of bicep curls,</v>

627
00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:19.620
<v Speaker 3>it must be critical that you do tricep </v>
<v Speaker 3>extensions or dips or something along </v>

628
00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:19.620
<v Speaker 3>those lines.</v>

629
00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:20.960
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what's more,</v>

630
00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:24.620
<v Speaker 2>what's even more important is to engage </v>
<v Speaker 2>the tendons and ligaments,</v>

631
00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:27.200
<v Speaker 2>the elastic components of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the,</v>

632
00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:32.280
<v Speaker 2>of the connective tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the musculaR attending unit as a </v>

633
00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:32.330
<v Speaker 2>whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now that's on a,</v>

634
00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:33.790
<v Speaker 2>that's a whole nother level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>ThAt's like a.</v>

635
00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:36.590
<v Speaker 2>It requires a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>essential overload.</v>

636
00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:38.540
<v Speaker 2>Essentially it would be like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement coming downward,</v>

637
00:27:38.541 --> 00:27:41.000
<v Speaker 2>like when you do a bench press,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the negative portion of that,</v>

638
00:27:41.001 --> 00:27:46.001
<v Speaker 2>that's the eccentric portion of the lift</v>
<v Speaker 2>has to come down with approximately 40 </v>

639
00:27:46.011 --> 00:27:51.011
<v Speaker 2>percent greater force downward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then it goes up to maintain muscular </v>

640
00:27:51.011 --> 00:27:52.250
<v Speaker 2>equilibrium.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you do that?</v>

641
00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:57.580
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>biometrics biometrics are a perfect </v>

642
00:27:57.580 --> 00:27:57.580
<v Speaker 2>example of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like</v>

643
00:27:57.580 --> 00:28:02.260
<v Speaker 3>do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would not just incorporate bench </v>

644
00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:02.260
<v Speaker 3>press,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would do</v>

645
00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:02.260
<v Speaker 2>like a plow metric.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Manage press.</v>

646
00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:03.660
<v Speaker 2>How's that work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

647
00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:05.860
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you have video or </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything that,</v>

648
00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:06.710
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>

649
00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:11.130
<v Speaker 2>you can probably see on my instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

650
00:28:11.170 --> 00:28:13.340
<v Speaker 2>you probably seen bj penn doing it too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

651
00:28:14.170 --> 00:28:17.100
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so plyometric bench press?</v>

652
00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:22.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As opposed to a traditional bench trust </v>

653
00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:22.260
<v Speaker 2>on what happens with that is I can </v>
<v Speaker 2>describe it when,</v>

654
00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:23.290
<v Speaker 2>if he brings it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

655
00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:26.260
<v Speaker 2>I can describe it now if you like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see anything on this room?</v>

656
00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:30.800
<v Speaker 2>Is it a speed of sport?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

657
00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:31.950

<v Speaker 2>speed of sport.</v>

658
00:28:31.951 --> 00:28:34.370

<v Speaker 2>see one I hope finally here,</v>

659
00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:37.260
<v Speaker 2>here go plyometric ballistic bench </v>
<v Speaker 2>press.</v>

660
00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:38.880
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I'd use that one to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>honest.</v>

661
00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:40.260
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

<v Speaker 3>because it's a dude with crazy hair.</v>

675
00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:16.680

<v Speaker 3>that's the most bad ass chick of all </v>

676
00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:16.680
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you took a jump like that.</v>

677
00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:20.941
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's like the ronda rousey of box </v>

678
00:29:20.941 --> 00:29:20.941
<v Speaker 3>jumpers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

679
00:29:20.941 --> 00:29:21.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That looks like a girl.</v>

680
00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:23.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>up until you go.</v>

681
00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:28.350
<v Speaker 3>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is she even doing with our </v>

682
00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:28.350
<v Speaker 3>endocrine system?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

683
00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:31.120
<v Speaker 3>Like jesus christ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are crazy jumps,</v>

684
00:29:31.121 --> 00:29:31.540
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

685
00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:33.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are.</v>

686
00:29:33.741 --> 00:29:38.741
<v Speaker 2>This kid came to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was about five weeks after a grade </v>

687
00:29:38.741 --> 00:29:41.171
<v Speaker 2>two ankle sprain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you can see this heels don't even </v>

688
00:29:41.171 --> 00:29:41.171
<v Speaker 2>touch there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just All balls of the feet,</v>

689
00:29:41.171 --> 00:29:43.150
<v Speaker 2>the toes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is similar to what,</v>

690
00:29:43.151 --> 00:29:45.130
<v Speaker 2>like an ice have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>excuse me,</v>

691
00:29:45.131 --> 00:29:46.660
<v Speaker 2>a plow plow metric,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

692
00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:48.020
<v Speaker 2>bench press would look like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they,</v>

693
00:29:48.030 --> 00:29:50.620
<v Speaker 2>we're doing with the feet right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So these jumps,</v>

694
00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:56.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm like your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your big obviously on explosive </v>

695
00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:56.280
<v Speaker 2>movements,</v>
<v Speaker 2>plyometrics.</v>

696
00:29:56.280 --> 00:30:01.050
<v Speaker 2>So this thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen this on the ba bj penn </v>

697
00:30:01.050 --> 00:30:04.200
<v Speaker 2>training things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said this kid is sitting with his </v>

698
00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:04.200
<v Speaker 2>back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's lying on his back rather,</v>

699
00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:06.400
<v Speaker 2>but it's but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but has a bounce ball under it.</v>

700
00:30:06.401 --> 00:30:09.130
<v Speaker 2>And then there's this padded thing above</v>
<v Speaker 2>him that he keeps kicking up.</v>

701
00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:12.880
<v Speaker 2>and what's the philosophy behind that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

702
00:30:12.881 --> 00:30:14.620
<v Speaker 2>you learn how to control your limb </v>
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>

703
00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:16.990
<v Speaker 2>When you're upside down like that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no load.</v>

704
00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:20.650
<v Speaker 2>You get greater control of your limb at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same time you can,</v>

705
00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:22.930
<v Speaker 2>you can work the full extension of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>foot,</v>

706
00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:26.470
<v Speaker 2>which is crucial in pretty much every </v>
<v Speaker 2>sport.</v>

707
00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:28.950
<v Speaker 2>So he's catching these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these guys,</v>

708
00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:30.790
<v Speaker 2>these things for arms to now and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>

709
00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:35.800
<v Speaker 2>So that's like a plant metric movement </v>
<v Speaker 2>right there for the upper body right </v>

710
00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:35.800
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's explosive.</v>

711
00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:36.220
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's interesting is that these,</v>

712
00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:41.310
<v Speaker 2>other than this particular exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are machines and a lot of people </v>

713
00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:42.790
<v Speaker 2>right here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This when joe right there.</v>

714
00:30:42.791 --> 00:30:44.260
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is the bench?</v>

715
00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:45.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

716
00:30:45.941 --> 00:30:47.820
<v Speaker 2>so it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You catch it with your hands.</v>

717
00:30:47.821 --> 00:30:50.390
<v Speaker 2>There's pads,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he's throwing it off so he.</v>

718
00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:53.670
<v Speaker 2>He's maximizing this contraction as it </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes off him.</v>

719
00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:55.600
<v Speaker 2>He's not shortening his reach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

720
00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:58.780
<v Speaker 2>he's got to produce a great amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>force to throw that off his fingers.</v>

721
00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:01.690
<v Speaker 2>That last thing he did was crazy balance</v>
<v Speaker 2>ball thing.</v>

722
00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:04.510
<v Speaker 2>This is nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's some incredible movement.</v>

723
00:31:04.570 --> 00:31:09.570
<v Speaker 2>He's a kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a three time national champion for </v>

724
00:31:09.570 --> 00:31:10.450
<v Speaker 2>taekwondo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus christ.</v>

725
00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:13.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That kid is ridiculously flexible.</v>

726
00:31:13.271 --> 00:31:16.240
<v Speaker 2>Look at that fucking leg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's that kid's name?</v>

727
00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:18.250
<v Speaker 2>Ryan tucker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

728
00:31:18.251 --> 00:31:20.620
<v Speaker 2>Where's he out of torrance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Torrance,</v>

729
00:31:20.621 --> 00:31:22.900
<v Speaker 2>California.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's in national taekwondo champion.</v>

730
00:31:22.910 --> 00:31:23.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>

731
00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:27.630
<v Speaker 2>Taekwondo has its fault,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but god was.</v>

732
00:31:27.670 --> 00:31:32.670
<v Speaker 2>When it comes to leg dexterity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of those guys have the most </v>

733
00:31:32.670 --> 00:31:35.260
<v Speaker 2>unbelievable leg dexterity and if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could teach them all the other skills,</v>

734
00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:37.300
<v Speaker 2>thai wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all this stuff,</v>

735
00:31:37.301 --> 00:31:39.190
<v Speaker 2>they have such a weird advantage with </v>
<v Speaker 2>their legs.</v>

736
00:31:39.191 --> 00:31:40.570
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like looking at that guy.</v>

737
00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:43.000
<v Speaker 2>Fucking people can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not many.</v>

738
00:31:43.150 --> 00:31:45.130
<v Speaker 2>That's not what that kind of range of </v>
<v Speaker 2>motion.</v>

739
00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:47.390
<v Speaker 2>And he's doing it with ankle weights on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what going?</v>

740
00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:48.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many,</v>

741
00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:49.030
<v Speaker 2>how much pounds?</v>

742
00:31:49.030 --> 00:31:50.860
<v Speaker 2>Probably like two and a half pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>just very light.</v>

743
00:31:50.890 --> 00:31:55.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just enough to get a stretch out of the </v>

744
00:31:55.890 --> 00:31:55.890
<v Speaker 2>muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's what we're trying to do.</v>

745
00:31:55.890 --> 00:31:55.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole method.</v>

746
00:31:55.890 --> 00:32:00.480
<v Speaker 2>Here's the stretch shortening cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you want to stretch the muscle before</v>

747
00:32:01.331 --> 00:32:06.331
<v Speaker 2>you shorten it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so stretch it before you can track that </v>

748
00:32:06.331 --> 00:32:06.490
<v Speaker 2>plan metrics through the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They put the tendons,</v>

749
00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:10.270
<v Speaker 2>ligaments and muscles stretch and I just</v>
<v Speaker 2>snapped back with greater force.</v>

750
00:32:10.930 --> 00:32:12.700
<v Speaker 2>So that's called the stretch shortening </v>
<v Speaker 2>cycle.</v>

751
00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:18.180
<v Speaker 2>So now the benefit of that is it trains </v>
<v Speaker 2>fast twitch at a speed also that's </v>

752
00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:23.880
<v Speaker 2>relevant to the sport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're not training at the speed </v>

753
00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:23.880
<v Speaker 2>of sport,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're training any slower than that.</v>

754
00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:24.790
<v Speaker 2>you're training slow twitch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're training,</v>

755
00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:28.630
<v Speaker 2>you're doing a detrimental a exercise </v>
<v Speaker 2>for your sport.</v>

756
00:32:29.050 --> 00:32:33.730
<v Speaker 2>So anytime you're doing like a heavy </v>
<v Speaker 2>lift that slow.</v>

757
00:32:33.790 --> 00:32:35.980
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think that that's bad for the sport?</v>

758
00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:37.480
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Without a doubt.</v>

759
00:32:37.510 --> 00:32:37.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

760
00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:38.940
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

761
00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:43.990
<v Speaker 2>well it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it makes sense if you look at the </v>

762
00:32:43.990 --> 00:32:45.710
<v Speaker 2>best athletes are the ones that have the</v>
<v Speaker 2>highest rate of forced development,</v>

763
00:32:45.970 --> 00:32:50.970
<v Speaker 2>the ones that can produce the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of force in the least amount of </v>

764
00:32:50.970 --> 00:32:50.970
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

765
00:32:50.970 --> 00:32:53.240
<v Speaker 2>So that means like a guy that can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

766
00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:58.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jump and touch his head on the ceiling </v>

767
00:32:58.780 --> 00:32:58.780
<v Speaker 2>versus a guy that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

768
00:32:58.780 --> 00:32:59.300
<v Speaker 2>in a split second person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy who would take him three or four</v>

769
00:32:59.301 --> 00:33:04.301
<v Speaker 2>seconds to get up there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that will be a comparison between a </v>

770
00:33:04.301 --> 00:33:07.781
<v Speaker 2>plyometric band trust.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I just showed you on the video </v>

771
00:33:07.781 --> 00:33:09.350
<v Speaker 2>there as compared to like a 225,</v>
<v Speaker 2>250 pound bench press.</v>

772
00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:13.490
<v Speaker 2>So you're a biG fan of doing everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just exploded everything.</v>

773
00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:18.520
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting because there is a </v>

774
00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:19.400
<v Speaker 2>school of thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially along with jujitsu guys,</v>

775
00:33:19.401 --> 00:33:23.750
<v Speaker 2>were they like a super super slow </v>
<v Speaker 2>training where they'll do like a chin up</v>

776
00:33:23.751 --> 00:33:25.850
<v Speaker 2>and each chinup takes like 15,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 seconds.</v>

777
00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:27.020
<v Speaker 2>You seen that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

778
00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:29.150
<v Speaker 2>Do you think about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just a pretty much,</v>

779
00:33:29.151 --> 00:33:34.151
<v Speaker 2>that's an isotonic contraction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't see how that even helps jujitsu </v>

780
00:33:34.151 --> 00:33:34.151
<v Speaker 2>at all either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

781
00:33:34.151 --> 00:33:36.920
<v Speaker 2>the idea is that if you get someone's </v>
<v Speaker 2>back and you're working the choke,</v>

782
00:33:36.970 --> 00:33:38.840
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know your arms might gas out,</v>

783
00:33:38.841 --> 00:33:41.660
<v Speaker 2>but this way they won't match up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you right now,</v>

784
00:33:41.661 --> 00:33:46.661
<v Speaker 2>as soon as the whole thing with bj penn </v>
<v Speaker 2>opened my eyes to so many different </v>

785
00:33:46.661 --> 00:33:50.441
<v Speaker 2>things and what I felt when I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>training with him was there was no </v>

786
00:33:50.441 --> 00:33:52.160
<v Speaker 2>strength.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His technique was so precisely time that</v>

787
00:33:52.161 --> 00:33:54.030
<v Speaker 2>he needed absolutely no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no strength.</v>

788
00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:55.430
<v Speaker 2>Literally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

789
00:33:55.431 --> 00:34:00.431
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was more about timing and the speed </v>

790
00:34:00.431 --> 00:34:01.250
<v Speaker 2>at which he moved and so if you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>squeezing the guy,</v>

791
00:34:01.251 --> 00:34:03.490
<v Speaker 2>maybe you need to brush up on your </v>
<v Speaker 2>technique a little bit,</v>

792
00:34:03.491 --> 00:34:05.060
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what I mean?</v>

793
00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:07.400
<v Speaker 2>Like when you've trained with john.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jock I ticket.</v>

794
00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:08.440
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

795
00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:10.760
<v Speaker 2>When I started jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started with hixon gracie.</v>

796
00:34:10.761 --> 00:34:15.761
<v Speaker 2>I was there for three years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got my blue belt from hixson and then </v>

797
00:34:15.761 --> 00:34:17.510
<v Speaker 2>I went to the machado school in redondo </v>
<v Speaker 2>beach and I went there at a time.</v>

798
00:34:17.511 --> 00:34:19.910
<v Speaker 2>When you show up on saturdays,</v>
<v Speaker 2>john,</v>

799
00:34:19.911 --> 00:34:21.170
<v Speaker 2>john,</v>
<v Speaker 2>john,</v>

800
00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:22.430
<v Speaker 2>he again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>haji,</v>

801
00:34:22.431 --> 00:34:24.440
<v Speaker 2>and they're all on the mat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are training with the students.</v>

802
00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:26.480
<v Speaker 2>Plus you have bob bass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have rick williams,</v>

803
00:34:26.481 --> 00:34:31.481
<v Speaker 2>you have all these great black belts </v>
<v Speaker 2>underneath them where are training with </v>

804
00:34:31.481 --> 00:34:32.760
<v Speaker 2>all the students deaf and so how can you</v>
<v Speaker 2>beat that role?</v>

805
00:34:32.810 --> 00:34:33.710
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like amazing.</v>

806
00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:38.950
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's like these guys have these </v>

807
00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:38.950
<v Speaker 2>red things on their black lady,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

808
00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:39.200
<v Speaker 2>what the heck is this man?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

809
00:34:39.201 --> 00:34:39.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

810
00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:41.180
<v Speaker 2>what planet is this?</v>

811
00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:46.310
<v Speaker 2>Are these guys good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

812
00:34:47.150 --> 00:34:50.420
<v Speaker 2>but you've trained with john jockey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You feel how he just effortless whatever</v>

813
00:34:50.421 --> 00:34:52.430
<v Speaker 2>you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do it to yourself.</v>

814
00:34:53.180 --> 00:34:54.980
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the same thing with bj penn.</v>

815
00:34:55.200 --> 00:35:00.200
<v Speaker 2>It's like I was a decent black belt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was okay when I first got my black </v>

816
00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:02.330
<v Speaker 2>belt and then after training with bj and</v>
<v Speaker 2>those guys,</v>

817
00:35:02.331 --> 00:35:03.140
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being in a,</v>

818
00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:07.790
<v Speaker 2>in that training camp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it completely opened my mind to fuck.</v>

819
00:35:07.791 --> 00:35:10.370
<v Speaker 2>I've been doing everything wrong for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>last 20 years.</v>

820
00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:13.010
<v Speaker 2>How so?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Forcing things.</v>

821
00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:15.200
<v Speaker 2>I was forcing everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my workouts,</v>

822
00:35:15.201 --> 00:35:17.540
<v Speaker 2>I was forcing everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was pushing myself to the limit.</v>

823
00:35:17.541 --> 00:35:18.920
<v Speaker 2>I was lifting heavy weights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Money.</v>

824
00:35:18.921 --> 00:35:21.800
<v Speaker 2>I could squat 425 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can bench three.</v>

825
00:35:21.801 --> 00:35:26.801
<v Speaker 2>Oh five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I weighed 168 pounds so people can talk </v>

826
00:35:26.801 --> 00:35:27.230
<v Speaker 2>to me all they want about weightlifting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I tell you right now,</v>

827
00:35:27.590 --> 00:35:30.710
<v Speaker 2>I am far more far stronger than I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever been.</v>

828
00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:32.720
<v Speaker 2>Like I might not look it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like,</v>

829
00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:34.610
<v Speaker 2>just great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't be hard on yourself.</v>

830
00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:35.230
<v Speaker 2>Thanks man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>

831
00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:40.270
<v Speaker 2>You don't think I needed a nose job or </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything but,</v>

832
00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:42.810
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

833
00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:46.710
<v Speaker 2>it's the way the body moves as a unit as</v>
<v Speaker 2>compared to weightlifting,</v>

834
00:35:46.711 --> 00:35:49.560
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which actually fragments muscle groups.</v>

835
00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:54.620
<v Speaker 2>So things along the lines of like bench </v>
<v Speaker 2>presses and curls and absolutely it's in</v>

836
00:35:56.900 --> 00:35:59.730
<v Speaker 2>a sensitivity training is training the </v>
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>

837
00:35:59.970 --> 00:36:02.040
<v Speaker 2>But what about like guys who want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>bulk up,</v>

838
00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:07.070
<v Speaker 2>like I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what meckey shall stone when he </v>

839
00:36:07.070 --> 00:36:09.471
<v Speaker 2>trained evander holyfield to get them up</v>
<v Speaker 2>to heavyweight and he had them do all </v>

840
00:36:09.471 --> 00:36:10.920
<v Speaker 2>this crazy weightlifting stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think about that?</v>

841
00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:13.250
<v Speaker 2>A lot of that's genetics really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

842
00:36:13.251 --> 00:36:14.130
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

843
00:36:14.131 --> 00:36:15.570
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's mexican supplements.</v>

844
00:36:15.571 --> 00:36:18.240
<v Speaker 2>Could be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could be very well,</v>

845
00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:23.720
<v Speaker 2>but I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think genetics play a huge role in </v>

846
00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:23.720
<v Speaker 2>that and what's your frame can handle.</v>

847
00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:25.950
<v Speaker 2>There's an optimal size for your frame.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

848
00:36:25.951 --> 00:36:30.690
<v Speaker 2>My guys I've seen ultimately times guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>would put on more muscle than their body</v>

849
00:36:30.691 --> 00:36:32.520
<v Speaker 2>can handle on their performance </v>
<v Speaker 2>deteriorates.</v>

850
00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:34.980
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vanda was a fairly big guy.</v>

851
00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:40.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he can handle it with this frame </v>

852
00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:40.060
<v Speaker 2>plus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

853
00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:40.060
<v Speaker 2>you have to look at the genetics of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>athlete too,</v>

854
00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:42.810
<v Speaker 2>but if you take a guy like I'm perfect </v>
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>

855
00:36:42.811 --> 00:36:46.770
<v Speaker 2>maybe like Michael Jordan when Michael </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jordan was playing against the pistons,</v>

856
00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:51.800
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like one of the things that he realized </v>

857
00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:51.800
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jesus,</v>

858
00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:51.800
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting pushed around and getting my</v>

859
00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:54.210
<v Speaker 2>ass kicked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to bulk up when a guy wants a bulk</v>

860
00:36:54.211 --> 00:36:59.211
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's very few ways to bulk up other </v>

861
00:36:59.211 --> 00:36:59.211
<v Speaker 2>than lifting heavy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

862
00:36:59.211 --> 00:37:01.920
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say no,</v>

863
00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:03.360
<v Speaker 2>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

864
00:37:03.361 --> 00:37:03.850
<v Speaker 2>let me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me,</v>

865
00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:08.860
<v Speaker 2>let me say this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's too much of an emphasis </v>

866
00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:11.550
<v Speaker 2>on getting bigger and it might've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>more advisable to train your body.</v>

867
00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:16.580
<v Speaker 2>Maybe there were certain weaknesses in </v>
<v Speaker 2>his hips or his feet or lower back or </v>

868
00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:20.511
<v Speaker 2>obliques that were making him weaker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen plenty of guys whose whose </v>

869
00:37:20.511 --> 00:37:22.530
<v Speaker 2>bodies are working as a unit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like with my,</v>

870
00:37:22.590 --> 00:37:27.590
<v Speaker 2>with the type of training that I offer a</v>
<v Speaker 2>that can literally bullied like guys </v>

871
00:37:27.590 --> 00:37:29.220
<v Speaker 2>that are way bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more muscular,</v>

872
00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:32.820
<v Speaker 2>and it all comes down to the efficiency </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the movement.</v>

873
00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:35.460
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But a guy like,</v>

874
00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:38.340
<v Speaker 2>here's a good example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a guy like brock lesnar,</v>

875
00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:43.520
<v Speaker 2>you can't get that fucking big and less.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're throwing some really heavy shit </v>

876
00:37:44.731 --> 00:37:45.460
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

877
00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:48.800
<v Speaker 2>Or taking mexican style bowl a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit.</v>

878
00:37:48.810 --> 00:37:50.250
<v Speaker 2>A little bit of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

879
00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:51.720
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're absolutely right.</v>

880
00:37:51.721 --> 00:37:53.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean there is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is,</v>

881
00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:57.000
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it then again,</v>

882
00:37:57.730 --> 00:38:01.530
<v Speaker 2>haines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alaska as who beat him with more or less</v>

883
00:38:01.531 --> 00:38:03.150
<v Speaker 2>the bj penn approach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

884
00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:05.070
<v Speaker 2>Look at cain when cain is thrown a </v>
<v Speaker 2>punch,</v>

885
00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:08.890
<v Speaker 2>you never see like there's no tension.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no efficiency.</v>

886
00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:14.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's actually a good point because </v>

887
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.880
<v Speaker 2>that's been proven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that repetitive bouts of absolute </v>

888
00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:20.601
<v Speaker 2>strength training,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is like your maximum strength </v>

889
00:38:20.601 --> 00:38:20.601
<v Speaker 2>training,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like maximum bench press,</v>

890
00:38:20.601 --> 00:38:23.850
<v Speaker 2>the heavy lifts will deteriorate a </v>
<v Speaker 2>boxer's punching power and accuracy.</v>

891
00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:29.270
<v Speaker 2>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's been proven by the russians to </v>

892
00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:31.720
<v Speaker 2>erie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fast and it can last for up to </v>

893
00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:32.870
<v Speaker 2>several months still.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

894
00:38:32.871 --> 00:38:33.570
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>

895
00:38:33.571 --> 00:38:34.470
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

896
00:38:34.471 --> 00:38:36.070
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like say if</v>

897
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:39.820
<v Speaker 3>a guy goes through your conventional </v>
<v Speaker 3>strength program,</v>

898
00:38:40.270 --> 00:38:45.270
<v Speaker 3>a dead lifts bench press,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that can deteriorate his punching power</v>

899
00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:48.400
<v Speaker 2>because it deteriorates the speed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Strength qualities.</v>

900
00:38:48.401 --> 00:38:50.950
<v Speaker 2>There's different types of strength.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Speed.</v>

901
00:38:50.951 --> 00:38:53.740
<v Speaker 2>Strength is one that emphasizes speed </v>
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>

902
00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:56.530
<v Speaker 2>It would be like maybe like 60 percent </v>
<v Speaker 2>speed,</v>

903
00:38:56.531 --> 00:38:59.730
<v Speaker 2>40 percent strength.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if I had to put a ratio on,</v>

904
00:39:00.010 --> 00:39:05.010
<v Speaker 2>the emphasis is primarily on speed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every sport is one by a fraction of a </v>

905
00:39:05.010 --> 00:39:05.140
<v Speaker 2>second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just About,</v>

906
00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:10.710
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like even like a basketball team that's </v>

907
00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:12.691
<v Speaker 2>domInating the entire season,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something about every play that </v>

908
00:39:12.691 --> 00:39:16.861
<v Speaker 2>might be 1000th of a second faster than </v>
<v Speaker 2>the other teams that's making them </v>

909
00:39:16.861 --> 00:39:18.250
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then at the end it's cumulative.</v>

910
00:39:18.270 --> 00:39:23.270
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>It all adds up and it compounds on top </v>

911
00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:23.270
<v Speaker 2>of each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So at the end of the game it's,</v>

912
00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:24.520
<v Speaker 2>it's a mismatch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

913
00:39:24.530 --> 00:39:29.530
<v Speaker 2>So even though the pettis fight was </v>
<v Speaker 2>closer than people think it was a </v>

914
00:39:29.530 --> 00:39:32.620
<v Speaker 2>fraction of a second difference between </v>
<v Speaker 2>rafael striking and,</v>

915
00:39:33.150 --> 00:39:38.150
<v Speaker 2>and strike every time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every time and that compounds and </v>

916
00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:38.150
<v Speaker 2>compounds and how.</v>

917
00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:40.660
<v Speaker 3>that's a funny way to look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think you're right.</v>

918
00:39:40.930 --> 00:39:42.790
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he lAnded that straight left in the</v>

919
00:39:42.791 --> 00:39:46.450
<v Speaker 3>first round crack and you see pedis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his head snapped back.</v>

920
00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:51.840
<v Speaker 3>I was stunned first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the speed in which he threw that </v>

921
00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:51.840
<v Speaker 3>shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

922
00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:51.840
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

923
00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:56.170
<v Speaker 3>I was very impressed with the speed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also that,</v>

924
00:39:56.320 --> 00:40:01.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was able to keep that speed up </v>

925
00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:01.540
<v Speaker 3>through the fourth and fifth rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

926
00:40:01.541 --> 00:40:04.660
<v Speaker 3>when he nailed them in the first round,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean petta said from then on,</v>

927
00:40:04.661 --> 00:40:05.930
<v Speaker 3>he was having a hard time seeing out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

928
00:40:05.970 --> 00:40:09.250
<v Speaker 3>It was getting pretty much fucked from </v>
<v Speaker 3>then on that.</v>

929
00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:13.290
<v Speaker 3>That was super impressive because if you</v>
<v Speaker 3>go back and watch his earlier fights,</v>

930
00:40:13.330 --> 00:40:18.330
<v Speaker 3>like go back and watch them against </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jeremy Stevens were early in his career </v>

931
00:40:18.330 --> 00:40:20.560
<v Speaker 3>where he lost by knockout though the </v>
<v Speaker 3>stevens highlight reel.</v>

932
00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.390
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just was different guy,</v>

933
00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:24.880
<v Speaker 3>different fucking human being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

934
00:40:24.881 --> 00:40:29.881
<v Speaker 3>very few guys when you look at their </v>
<v Speaker 3>early ufc career and then look at their </v>

935
00:40:29.881 --> 00:40:32.230
<v Speaker 3>peak performance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which dos anjos clearly is in his peak.</v>

936
00:40:32.231 --> 00:40:35.380
<v Speaker 3>He just won the title against one of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>best guys ever in that division.</v>

937
00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:38.320
<v Speaker 3>But he's a different human being all </v>
<v Speaker 3>around.</v>

938
00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:44.020
<v Speaker 2>The funny thing is I don't really read </v>
<v Speaker 2>too much on the internet and I that I </v>

939
00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:44.020
<v Speaker 2>had to have this one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

940
00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:46.480
<v Speaker 2>people sayIng pdds and all this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

941
00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:52.270
<v Speaker 2>and others I see comments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no strength training program </v>

942
00:40:52.270 --> 00:40:52.580
<v Speaker 2>that can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he look,</v>

943
00:40:52.581 --> 00:40:53.930
<v Speaker 2>it's been going on for a year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

944
00:40:53.931 --> 00:40:56.180
<v Speaker 2>we've been building it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

945
00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:57.950
<v Speaker 2>so if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you compare,</v>

946
00:40:57.951 --> 00:40:59.480
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like his fight with serone,</v>

947
00:40:59.481 --> 00:41:00.880
<v Speaker 2>he's really stiff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

948
00:41:00.970 --> 00:41:03.420
<v Speaker 2>he told me himself by the third round he</v>
<v Speaker 2>was gas.</v>

949
00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:04.460
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fatIgue.</v>

950
00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:08.030
<v Speaker 2>And so this doesn't like one training </v>
<v Speaker 2>camp,</v>

951
00:41:08.031 --> 00:41:13.031
<v Speaker 2>I mean this has been going on for a year</v>
<v Speaker 2>of really good trading where he and I </v>

952
00:41:13.031 --> 00:41:13.400
<v Speaker 2>are trading like three or four times a </v>
<v Speaker 2>week.</v>

953
00:41:13.401 --> 00:41:14.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

954
00:41:14.390 --> 00:41:16.850
<v Speaker 2>granted that separate the times in </v>
<v Speaker 2>between fights when he,</v>

955
00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:18.900
<v Speaker 2>he's got his downtime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>

956
00:41:18.930 --> 00:41:20.660
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's been very consistent with it.</v>

957
00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:23.660
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get after about three months of this</v>

958
00:41:23.661 --> 00:41:28.661
<v Speaker 2>as when you see the tendons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ligaments and everything really start </v>

959
00:41:28.661 --> 00:41:29.570
<v Speaker 2>working as a unit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's when it really,</v>

960
00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:32.150
<v Speaker 2>the power and everything really come </v>
<v Speaker 2>into play.</v>

961
00:41:32.151 --> 00:41:33.620
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so safe.</v>

962
00:41:33.621 --> 00:41:34.010
<v Speaker 2>He took a</v>

963
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:35.420
<v Speaker 3>guy like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

964
00:41:35.450 --> 00:41:36.240
<v Speaker 3>let's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's this?</v>

965
00:41:36.290 --> 00:41:39.290
<v Speaker 3>Pull a guy out of the roster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's go with matt mitrione.</v>

966
00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:43.330
<v Speaker 3>Big heavyweight fast guy moves really </v>
<v Speaker 3>well for a heavyweight.</v>

967
00:41:43.610 --> 00:41:45.350
<v Speaker 3>What would you do with a guy like that?</v>

968
00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:47.900
<v Speaker 2>First thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy comes to me the first day,</v>

969
00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:53.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do muscle tests on them and</v>
<v Speaker 2>find out what's going on with his body </v>

970
00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:54.710
<v Speaker 2>and find out if there's any types of </v>
<v Speaker 2>weaknesses in his feet.</v>

971
00:41:54.711 --> 00:41:57.680
<v Speaker 2>And the rotational power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his hips lower back,</v>

972
00:41:57.681 --> 00:42:00.470
<v Speaker 2>especially a big guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lower back and lower abdominal cavity.</v>

973
00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:05.840
<v Speaker 2>A flexibility his shoulders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't stress that enough for punching </v>

974
00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:09.581
<v Speaker 2>power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is an optimal range of motion </v>

975
00:42:09.581 --> 00:42:11.780
<v Speaker 2>where you produce the greatest amount of</v>
<v Speaker 2>force in all of your joints.</v>

976
00:42:12.290 --> 00:42:16.280
<v Speaker 2>So does that mean that pretty makes is </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty easy to understand,</v>

977
00:42:16.281 --> 00:42:16.700
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

978
00:42:16.730 --> 00:42:19.010
<v Speaker 2>so if my shoulder flection or my </v>
<v Speaker 2>shoulder,</v>

979
00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:20.500
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>flexibility is,</v>

980
00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:21.950
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is here,</v>

981
00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:24.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to lose speed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's,</v>

982
00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:25.820
<v Speaker 2>if it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's.</v>

983
00:42:25.821 --> 00:42:26.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

984
00:42:26.421 --> 00:42:28.400
<v Speaker 2>If it's too short,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to lose speed too long.</v>

985
00:42:28.401 --> 00:42:30.340
<v Speaker 2>You're going to lose speed to islam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

986
00:42:30.350 --> 00:42:34.190
<v Speaker 2>There's two flexible acts really just </v>
<v Speaker 2>too much slack in the muscle.</v>

987
00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:37.430
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how would a guy get to flexible?</v>

988
00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:40.470
<v Speaker 2>Some people are born with that and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know what I mean,</v>

989
00:42:40.471 --> 00:42:45.471
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that can be a genetic thing or like </v>

990
00:42:45.471 --> 00:42:46.110
<v Speaker 2>swimmers tend to have a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>flexibility in the shoulders.</v>

991
00:42:46.111 --> 00:42:47.490
<v Speaker 2>But I mean for that support their </v>
<v Speaker 2>support,</v>

992
00:42:47.491 --> 00:42:50.280
<v Speaker 2>that's okay because they're kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>dragging that resistance,</v>

993
00:42:50.281 --> 00:42:52.500
<v Speaker 2>that slower resistance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But for,</v>

994
00:42:52.530 --> 00:42:55.020
<v Speaker 2>for a snap in the muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's gotta be a little,</v>

995
00:42:55.050 --> 00:42:59.320
<v Speaker 2>just the right amount of tension in </v>
<v Speaker 2>order for that muscle to activate as,</v>

996
00:42:59.321 --> 00:43:00.480
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as quickest.</v>

997
00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:03.270
<v Speaker 2>So if it's too long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine like a rubber band.</v>

998
00:43:03.271 --> 00:43:04.790
<v Speaker 2>If it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they're slacking the rubber band,</v>

999
00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:06.960
<v Speaker 2>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't get the snap out of it.</v>

1000
00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:07.810
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see.</v>

1001
00:43:07.870 --> 00:43:08.860
<v Speaker 3>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then is that,</v>

1002
00:43:08.890 --> 00:43:11.230
<v Speaker 3>does that make one more prone to </v>
<v Speaker 3>injuries as well?</v>

1003
00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:17.020
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can cause joint instability or </v>

1004
00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:17.330
<v Speaker 2>impingement?</v>
<v Speaker 2>All kinds of stuff.</v>

1005
00:43:17.331 --> 00:43:19.610
<v Speaker 2>Like I've heard of that with knees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

1006
00:43:19.611 --> 00:43:22.340
<v Speaker 2>And that goes back to the muscular </v>
<v Speaker 2>equilibrium thing I was talking about.</v>

1007
00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:27.760
<v Speaker 2>So let's imagine you're doing heavy </v>
<v Speaker 2>front squats every day for like three </v>

1008
00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:27.760
<v Speaker 2>times a week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1009
00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:30.050
<v Speaker 2>80 percent of your one rep max or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

1010
00:43:30.290 --> 00:43:33.230
<v Speaker 2>and you're doing your max is on one </v>
<v Speaker 2>every other week or whatever.</v>

1011
00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:37.000
<v Speaker 2>You're developing those quadriceps at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the expense of the hamstrings.</v>

1012
00:43:37.010 --> 00:43:40.190
<v Speaker 2>It's not even a running movement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really just a front squat.</v>

1013
00:43:40.191 --> 00:43:45.191
<v Speaker 2>That's just a movement up and down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's good for like putting groceries </v>

1014
00:43:45.191 --> 00:43:45.191
<v Speaker 2>on a top of a shelf or something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1015
00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:46.940
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

1016
00:43:46.941 --> 00:43:48.950
<v Speaker 2>you're going to shorten those quadricep </v>
<v Speaker 2>muscles,</v>

1017
00:43:48.951 --> 00:43:49.640
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna,</v>

1018
00:43:49.641 --> 00:43:54.641
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Build them and make them bigger and </v>

1019
00:43:54.641 --> 00:43:54.641
<v Speaker 2>shorter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what happens with the hamstring,</v>

1020
00:43:54.641 --> 00:43:59.471
<v Speaker 2>it gets longer and weaker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now you've got an imbalance between </v>

1021
00:43:59.471 --> 00:43:59.471
<v Speaker 2>the two.</v>

1022
00:43:59.630 --> 00:44:02.360
<v Speaker 3>So if someone was going to do front </v>
<v Speaker 3>squats,</v>

1023
00:44:02.361 --> 00:44:04.580
<v Speaker 3>they would have to do something to </v>
<v Speaker 3>compensate for that.</v>

1024
00:44:04.581 --> 00:44:08.120
<v Speaker 3>Like maybe some sort of a dead lift,</v>
<v Speaker 3>straight leg dead lift or something that</v>

1025
00:44:08.121 --> 00:44:09.110
<v Speaker 3>hamstring oriented</v>

1026
00:44:09.990 --> 00:44:14.990
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you're training the hampshire </v>

1027
00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:14.990
<v Speaker 2>depends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1028
00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:14.990
<v Speaker 2>let's put it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It depends on the sport they're going to</v>

1029
00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:15.340
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if it's.</v>

1030
00:44:15.341 --> 00:44:18.300
<v Speaker 2>If it's a fighter fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to have him doing that.</v>

1031
00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:19.350
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no squats,</v>

1032
00:44:19.530 --> 00:44:20.310
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No fronts,</v>

1033
00:44:20.311 --> 00:44:25.311
<v Speaker 2>but it's not practical for the sport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the most vital elements for </v>

1034
00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:28.680
<v Speaker 2>fighting in my opinion and is neglected </v>
<v Speaker 2>his feet.</v>

1035
00:44:28.690 --> 00:44:30.990
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like yoU hear mark talk about the Feet.</v>

1036
00:44:31.330 --> 00:44:36.330
<v Speaker 2>I talk about the feet all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The strength in the feet and what it </v>

1037
00:44:36.330 --> 00:44:40.230
<v Speaker 2>does for the nervous system are Crucial </v>
<v Speaker 2>for athletic performance.</v>

1038
00:44:40.231 --> 00:44:42.600
<v Speaker 2>And yet it's like one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>neglected areas.</v>

1039
00:44:43.290 --> 00:44:48.000
<v Speaker 2>The feet like the neural impulses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the sensory and motor nerves are very</v>

1040
00:44:48.001 --> 00:44:50.730
<v Speaker 2>highly active in the forefoot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

1041
00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:56.000
<v Speaker 2>And this can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this can actually help speed up your </v>

1042
00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:00.170
<v Speaker 2>reflexes by type or training the feet on</v>
<v Speaker 2>different planes like balance exercises </v>

1043
00:45:00.170 --> 00:45:04.461
<v Speaker 2>and stuff like that will actually speed </v>
<v Speaker 2>up that circuitry between the reaction </v>

1044
00:45:04.461 --> 00:45:06.420
<v Speaker 2>between the foot and the spinal cord </v>
<v Speaker 2>through,</v>

1045
00:45:06.421 --> 00:45:07.050
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1046
00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:12.080
<v Speaker 2>as you speed up the neural impulses </v>
<v Speaker 2>speed up the neural impulses by </v>

1047
00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:14.940
<v Speaker 2>strengthening the feet by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>without like reactive,</v>

1048
00:45:14.941 --> 00:45:15.840
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exercises,</v>

1049
00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:18.830
<v Speaker 2>balance exercises on like slant boards </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1050
00:45:18.831 --> 00:45:22.410
<v Speaker 2>and disks and stuff that forced the feet</v>
<v Speaker 2>to stay reactive.</v>

1051
00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:23.730
<v Speaker 2>Like is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1052
00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:27.360
<v Speaker 2>it can actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that reaction can kind of relay into the</v>

1053
00:45:27.361 --> 00:45:28.050
<v Speaker 2>whole body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1054
00:45:28.051 --> 00:45:33.051
<v Speaker 2>can can affect the entire body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you've ever been ice skating or </v>

1055
00:45:33.051 --> 00:45:34.800
<v Speaker 2>something and you slip like your hands </v>
<v Speaker 2>are already like,</v>

1056
00:45:34.810 --> 00:45:36.120
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

1057
00:45:36.121 --> 00:45:41.121
<v Speaker 2>They're already reacting before your </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain even has time to think because </v>

1058
00:45:41.121 --> 00:45:44.901
<v Speaker 2>it's processed in the spinal cord.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't even get processed in the </v>

1059
00:45:44.901 --> 00:45:48.261
<v Speaker 2>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your reaction from your lower limbs can </v>

1060
00:45:48.261 --> 00:45:50.421
<v Speaker 2>actually be processed in the lower </v>
<v Speaker 2>portion of your spinal cord and right </v>

1061
00:45:50.421 --> 00:45:51.690
<v Speaker 2>back out to your limbs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're like a safety mechanism.</v>

1062
00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:56.720
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you bought as sort of a fail safe </v>

1063
00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:56.720
<v Speaker 2>act.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1064
00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:56.720
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1065
00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:58.020
<v Speaker 2>there's no weight on the feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>put your fucking hands out dude.</v>

1066
00:45:58.080 --> 00:45:59.130
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1067
00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:02.430
<v Speaker 2>Can you put your brain doesn't even know</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's going on too late?</v>

1068
00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:03.750
<v Speaker 2>It would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it did,</v>

1069
00:46:03.751 --> 00:46:04.380
<v Speaker 2>it would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1070
00:46:04.381 --> 00:46:05.100
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>

1071
00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:10.220
<v Speaker 2>So by hyper training the feet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you keep the body in sort of a ready </v>

1072
00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:13.860
<v Speaker 2>state for reaction and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like manipulating the safety device</v>

1073
00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:17.760
<v Speaker 2>to increased sports performance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guys at the ana Jim were telling me,</v>

1074
00:46:17.761 --> 00:46:21.120
<v Speaker 2>the cub swanson does virtually all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>his workouts on a balance board.</v>

1075
00:46:21.390 --> 00:46:23.640
<v Speaker 2>It does either a balance board or </v>
<v Speaker 2>balanced ball,</v>

1076
00:46:23.641 --> 00:46:25.770
<v Speaker 2>like everything he does and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>extremely athletic.</v>

1077
00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:26.640
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1078
00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:31.530
<v Speaker 2>So when you're doing these heavy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heavy lifting it dead ends.</v>

1079
00:46:31.531 --> 00:46:35.860
<v Speaker 2>That impulse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it slows it down and not.</v>

1080
00:46:35.950 --> 00:46:37.950
<v Speaker 2>Not to mention you're neglecting the </v>
<v Speaker 2>forefoot.</v>

1081
00:46:37.951 --> 00:46:40.620
<v Speaker 2>All these exercises are pretty much done</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the ball on the hill.</v>

1082
00:46:41.330 --> 00:46:44.580
<v Speaker 2>I was squatting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember I was taught to press through</v>

1083
00:46:44.581 --> 00:46:46.860
<v Speaker 2>the heel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deadlifting the same thing,</v>

1084
00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:47.680
<v Speaker 2>so your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

1085
00:46:47.681 --> 00:46:52.681
<v Speaker 2>your training over and over these </v>
<v Speaker 2>movements that are not practical for a </v>

1086
00:46:52.681 --> 00:46:56.451
<v Speaker 2>sports movement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which pretty much every sport is played </v>

1087
00:46:56.451 --> 00:46:56.451
<v Speaker 2>on the forefoot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1088
00:46:56.451 --> 00:46:57.450
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you never really in a sport.</v>

1089
00:46:57.451 --> 00:47:00.090
<v Speaker 2>You very rarely push off the back of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>foot.</v>

1090
00:47:00.270 --> 00:47:03.830
<v Speaker 2>So kind of moving forward when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>punching the back heels around.</v>

1091
00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:08.040
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so knoWing that it's kind of like,</v>

1092
00:47:09.390 --> 00:47:10.500
<v Speaker 2>why are we doing this?</v>

1093
00:47:12.790 --> 00:47:15.450
<v Speaker 2>It's improper training.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it really makes sense.</v>

1094
00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:18.510
<v Speaker 2>Has been preaching this for years and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1095
00:47:18.660 --> 00:47:21.470
<v Speaker 2>and people kind of scoff at it and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>

1096
00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:26.500
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gotta get my heavy back squat and </v>

1097
00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:26.500
<v Speaker 2>that's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maybe this can help you with it,</v>

1098
00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:27.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>start training the feet,</v>

1099
00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:29.650
<v Speaker 2>looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at what we're talking about here</v>

1100
00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:34.800
<v Speaker 2>and the sequence of muscles that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to start firing when you do start </v>

1101
00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:38.791
<v Speaker 2>training the feed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how is this a better option for </v>

1102
00:47:38.791 --> 00:47:43.020
<v Speaker 2>squatting would be a front squat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now let's say you take a couple of </v>

1103
00:47:43.020 --> 00:47:45.610
<v Speaker 2>45 pound plates and you put them onto </v>
<v Speaker 2>the balls of your feet.</v>

1104
00:47:46.150 --> 00:47:51.150
<v Speaker 2>So now you're engaging more of a sports </v>
<v Speaker 2>movie and you're on the balls of your </v>

1105
00:47:51.150 --> 00:47:51.270
<v Speaker 2>feet and you're loading up the front </v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of the back,</v>

1106
00:47:51.271 --> 00:47:54.490
<v Speaker 2>which is the back squat is technically a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lower back exercise.</v>

1107
00:47:54.490 --> 00:47:56.710
<v Speaker 2>It really hits the lumbar and his lower </v>
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>

1108
00:47:56.711 --> 00:48:01.711
<v Speaker 2>A lot of front squats going to hit more </v>
<v Speaker 2>quadricep muscles require for jumping,</v>

1109
00:48:02.050 --> 00:48:07.050
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as well as the core and stabilizing the </v>

1110
00:48:07.050 --> 00:48:07.660
<v Speaker 2>spine with the abdominals and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

1111
00:48:07.661 --> 00:48:10.870
<v Speaker 2>So that's just a thought like maybe you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can do that.</v>

1112
00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:15.880
<v Speaker 2>You think like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>start thinking in that process where </v>

1113
00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:16.300
<v Speaker 2>you're training from the feet up the </v>
<v Speaker 2>forefoot up,</v>

1114
00:48:16.301 --> 00:48:21.301
<v Speaker 2>not just the heels of the forefoot up </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you'll start connecting different </v>

1115
00:48:21.301 --> 00:48:22.580
<v Speaker 2>muscles require for sports movements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1116
00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:27.660
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were talking before the podcast that </v>

1117
00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:28.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm really getting into yoga recently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>last couple of weeks I've been into it,</v>

1118
00:48:28.841 --> 00:48:33.841
<v Speaker 2>like in one of the things that is really</v>
<v Speaker 2>shocking to me is how much my feet hurt.</v>

1119
00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:39.630
<v Speaker 2>Like all the bouncing on my feet give </v>
<v Speaker 2>out before a lot of other stuff and.</v>

1120
00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:41.800
<v Speaker 2>But I do so many things barefoot.</v>

1121
00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:46.090
<v Speaker 2>I lift barefoot box all jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff's barefoot.</v>

1122
00:48:46.091 --> 00:48:47.800
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But for whatever reason,</v>

1123
00:48:48.070 --> 00:48:53.070
<v Speaker 2>like just standing there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>holding your foot up in the air and </v>

1124
00:48:53.070 --> 00:48:55.020
<v Speaker 2>stretching out my foot is the one that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>having a hard time dealing with it.</v>

1125
00:48:55.060 --> 00:48:55.960
<v Speaker 2>It's kinda.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1126
00:48:55.961 --> 00:49:00.961
<v Speaker 2>It's very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously I've weak feet in some weird </v>

1127
00:49:00.961 --> 00:49:01.210
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1128
00:49:01.330 --> 00:49:02.470
<v Speaker 2>it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just.</v>

1129
00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:05.860
<v Speaker 2>It never was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was never tested before.</v>

1130
00:49:06.370 --> 00:49:09.190
<v Speaker 2>The problem with that is when you do </v>
<v Speaker 2>have weakness in the feet,</v>

1131
00:49:09.250 --> 00:49:11.560
<v Speaker 2>other things start to compensate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like your hips,</v>

1132
00:49:11.860 --> 00:49:14.200
<v Speaker 2>your hips start to compensate for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>weaknesses and the feet.</v>

1133
00:49:14.650 --> 00:49:19.650
<v Speaker 2>I'd say a lot of guys have flat feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have poor hip abduction and </v>

1134
00:49:19.650 --> 00:49:22.471
<v Speaker 2>adduction or tight hamstrings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Flatfooted guys almost always are a </v>

1135
00:49:23.471 --> 00:49:25.300
<v Speaker 2>little hamstring dominant when they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>sprinting.</v>

1136
00:49:25.301 --> 00:49:27.280
<v Speaker 2>They're good at like the acceleration </v>
<v Speaker 2>phase,</v>

1137
00:49:27.281 --> 00:49:30.310
<v Speaker 2>but the tops the tops be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it lacking?</v>

1138
00:49:30.550 --> 00:49:31.300
<v Speaker 2>I have flat feet.</v>

1139
00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:33.400
<v Speaker 2>Do you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you get tight in the hamstrings?</v>

1140
00:49:33.610 --> 00:49:34.510
<v Speaker 2>Not really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1141
00:49:34.630 --> 00:49:35.560
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he might be.</v>

1142
00:49:35.561 --> 00:49:38.130
<v Speaker 2>The exception to the rule will have very</v>
<v Speaker 2>flexible hamstrings.</v>

1143
00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:42.470
<v Speaker 2>Probably the weed weed my hamstrings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nah,</v>

1144
00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:43.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm just kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1145
00:49:43.421 --> 00:49:45.610
<v Speaker 2>I just uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grew up doing taekwondo.</v>

1146
00:49:46.380 --> 00:49:49.590
<v Speaker 2>I have a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for whatever reason I don't,</v>

1147
00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:52.360
<v Speaker 2>I don't have tiging back there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

1148
00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:53.720
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1149
00:49:53.730 --> 00:49:55.390
<v Speaker 2>I definitely a flat fee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can we start?</v>

1150
00:49:55.460 --> 00:49:56.320
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kelly,</v>

1151
00:49:56.790 --> 00:49:58.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wrote that book,</v>

1152
00:49:58.061 --> 00:49:59.650
<v Speaker 2>the sub sea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The crossword guy.</v>

1153
00:49:59.700 --> 00:50:00.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1154
00:50:00.510 --> 00:50:05.510
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wrote a book called the supple </v>

1155
00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:05.510
<v Speaker 2>leopard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

1156
00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:06.160
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't even believe in flat feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said he thinks it's like you said,</v>

1157
00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:11.280
<v Speaker 2>it's like you're sort of almost like </v>
<v Speaker 2>learning from people around you to walk </v>

1158
00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:15.601
<v Speaker 2>and stand a certain way and it's almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a laziness of the posture of your </v>

1159
00:50:15.601 --> 00:50:16.030
<v Speaker 2>foot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To paraphrase him,</v>

1160
00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:16.770
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1161
00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:21.250
<v Speaker 2>I'd have to read it thoroughly and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinks that you could retrain someone to</v>

1162
00:50:21.251 --> 00:50:22.520
<v Speaker 2>have a hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't.</v>

1163
00:50:22.521 --> 00:50:23.590
<v Speaker 2>ABsolutely real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1164
00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:27.080
<v Speaker 2>Done it really from a guy like me </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I guy like,</v>

1165
00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:32.320
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the balance balancing type </v>

1166
00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:34.430
<v Speaker 2>exercises we have and the foot </v>
<v Speaker 2>strengthening modalities that we use.</v>

1167
00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:35.690
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely,</v>

1168
00:50:36.770 --> 00:50:37.420
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1169
00:50:37.570 --> 00:50:41.270
<v Speaker 2>I challenge you to try this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you try like a calf raise,</v>

1170
00:50:41.290 --> 00:50:46.290
<v Speaker 2>like or you can go on like a seated </v>
<v Speaker 2>seated a leg press and don't put any </v>

1171
00:50:46.431 --> 00:50:48.560
<v Speaker 2>weight on there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just do a few of your shoes on.</v>

1172
00:50:49.010 --> 00:50:54.010
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then take your shoes on and try a few </v>

1173
00:50:54.010 --> 00:50:54.260
<v Speaker 2>without your shoes and really </v>
<v Speaker 2>accentuated the movement and the toes to</v>

1174
00:50:54.261 --> 00:50:56.690
<v Speaker 2>the tip of the toe and not just to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pad of the toe,</v>

1175
00:50:56.691 --> 00:50:59.540
<v Speaker 2>but to the tip of the toe and see the </v>
<v Speaker 2>difference you feel on your achilles and</v>

1176
00:50:59.541 --> 00:51:00.230
<v Speaker 2>your calves.</v>

1177
00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:05.950
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guarantee you it's going to blow you </v>

1178
00:51:05.950 --> 00:51:07.811
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A tremendous difference when you just </v>

1179
00:51:07.811 --> 00:51:10.901
<v Speaker 2>use that little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that little extra inch of your toes and </v>

1180
00:51:10.901 --> 00:51:15.581
<v Speaker 2>you feel it all through the arch of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>foot and you fill it all the way up </v>

1181
00:51:15.581 --> 00:51:16.290
<v Speaker 2>through the calf.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really police something else.</v>

1182
00:51:16.310 --> 00:51:18.590
<v Speaker 2>that's where I always have pain in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>foot.</v>

1183
00:51:18.620 --> 00:51:20.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's always like a.</v>

1184
00:51:20.391 --> 00:51:25.391
<v Speaker 2>I got pain there from skiing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get pain there from sometimes hiking </v>

1185
00:51:25.391 --> 00:51:27.320
<v Speaker 2>gives me some pain there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1186
00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:29.330
<v Speaker 2>that's fixable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

1187
00:51:29.331 --> 00:51:30.950
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll talk about me later in that,</v>

1188
00:51:31.440 --> 00:51:33.190
<v Speaker 2>but that a lot of people have issues </v>
<v Speaker 2>with that.</v>

1189
00:51:33.191 --> 00:51:35.290
<v Speaker 2>A lot of issues with flat feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1190
00:51:35.370 --> 00:51:38.780
<v Speaker 2>do you find that fighters ever have </v>
<v Speaker 2>issues plotting,</v>

1191
00:51:38.781 --> 00:51:43.781
<v Speaker 2>like say if you get a guy and like maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's kind of lumbering like we all know </v>

1192
00:51:43.781 --> 00:51:46.220
<v Speaker 2>fighters that just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just don't move well on their feet.</v>

1193
00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:49.460
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>roselawn has the flattest feet I've ever</v>

1194
00:51:49.461 --> 00:51:54.320
<v Speaker 2>seen an athlete really actually maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>top three and so,</v>

1195
00:51:54.410 --> 00:51:59.410
<v Speaker 2>but surprisingly after this training </v>
<v Speaker 2>camp he had a little bit more strength </v>

1196
00:51:59.901 --> 00:52:02.660
<v Speaker 2>than I noticed that less of a drop in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the arches of his foot.</v>

1197
00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:06.860
<v Speaker 2>And so that says something about what </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're doing and there were points in the</v>

1198
00:52:06.861 --> 00:52:11.861
<v Speaker 2>fight where you can see him bouncing </v>
<v Speaker 2>around on his feet and he looks pretty </v>

1199
00:52:11.861 --> 00:52:14.591
<v Speaker 2>quick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think even like the 10th or 11th </v>

1200
00:52:14.591 --> 00:52:16.211
<v Speaker 2>round,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was popping around on his feet and </v>

1201
00:52:16.211 --> 00:52:16.211
<v Speaker 2>the announcer said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is this?</v>

1202
00:52:16.211 --> 00:52:16.940
<v Speaker 2>He's bounced around his feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks quick.</v>

1203
00:52:16.941 --> 00:52:21.941
<v Speaker 2>What's he doing now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this some kind of strategy or </v>

1204
00:52:21.941 --> 00:52:21.941
<v Speaker 2>whatever?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1205
00:52:21.941 --> 00:52:25.420
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we made incredible gains in like the </v>

1206
00:52:25.420 --> 00:52:25.420
<v Speaker 2>strength of his feet and his cast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1207
00:52:25.420 --> 00:52:28.730
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately he fights flatfooted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He comes at you head first and you know,</v>

1208
00:52:28.731 --> 00:52:29.630
<v Speaker 2>that's just the style.</v>

1209
00:52:29.630 --> 00:52:33.530
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was coming on in the later rounds.</v>

1210
00:52:33.531 --> 00:52:36.740
<v Speaker 2>Matina was cracking him early in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>

1211
00:52:37.470 --> 00:52:40.460
<v Speaker 2>That was a war to comment of the best </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've ever seen could be,</v>

1212
00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:42.230
<v Speaker 2>could very well be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did get hurt.</v>

1213
00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:44.660
<v Speaker 2>He got hurt one of the rounds and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>slowed him down.</v>

1214
00:52:44.750 --> 00:52:47.810
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to not say throws bombs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1215
00:52:47.811 --> 00:52:52.811
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was really pleaseD with his </v>

1216
00:52:52.811 --> 00:52:52.811
<v Speaker 2>conditioning though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He came out,</v>

1217
00:52:52.811 --> 00:52:53.080
<v Speaker 2>he actually came by on the way to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>packet.</v>

1218
00:52:53.081 --> 00:52:55.760
<v Speaker 2>I'll fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He flew into lax and he stopped by my gm</v>

1219
00:52:55.761 --> 00:52:57.890
<v Speaker 2>And he wanted to give me a bonus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1220
00:52:57.891 --> 00:52:59.390
<v Speaker 2>I've never felt like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Am I in a fight?</v>

1221
00:52:59.391 --> 00:53:02.090
<v Speaker 2>Even though I lost like that's the best </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've ever felt.</v>

1222
00:53:02.091 --> 00:53:03.620
<v Speaker 2>Like it's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

1223
00:53:03.621 --> 00:53:04.300
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1224
00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:09.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I looked as managers and actually like </v>

1225
00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:09.600
<v Speaker 2>maybe we should just wait until you win </v>
<v Speaker 2>little accent,</v>

1226
00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:10.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll,</v>

1227
00:53:10.660 --> 00:53:11.600
<v Speaker 2>we'll take care of when it.</v>

1228
00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:14.180
<v Speaker 2>When on a winning day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>so did you see the,</v>

1229
00:53:14.181 --> 00:53:15.940
<v Speaker 2>a urine sample that he gave?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1230
00:53:16.430 --> 00:53:17.090
<v Speaker 2>Tasty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>huh?</v>

1231

1232
00:53:18.801 --> 00:53:22.820

<v Speaker 2>a instagram page was a photo of his,</v>

1233
00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.470
<v Speaker 2>his urine sample looked like coca.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I've heard of that before.</v>

1237

<v Speaker 2>He said pop like coke,</v>

1239
00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:41.250
<v Speaker 2>breaking down muscle and dehydration and</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that and kidneys,</v>

<v Speaker 2>one of the first,</v>

1244
00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:49.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

1245
00:53:49.471 --> 00:53:51.390
<v Speaker 2>I have so much respect for both of those</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys.</v>

1246
00:53:51.450 --> 00:53:54.540
<v Speaker 2>Like when tesa and rose on honor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both in my top five,</v>

1247
00:53:54.570 --> 00:53:58.590
<v Speaker 2>top 10 fighters with tcs punching power </v>
<v Speaker 2>is freaking ridiculous.</v>

1248
00:53:58.590 --> 00:53:59.910
<v Speaker 2>Ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember,</v>

1249
00:53:59.911 --> 00:54:01.050
<v Speaker 2>I was in there and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where am I,</v>

1250
00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:01.980
<v Speaker 2>where am I going to sit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1251
00:54:01.981 --> 00:54:03.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going to be originally going to be</v>

1252
00:54:03.361 --> 00:54:08.361
<v Speaker 2>in a corner and then I ended up getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>a seat at ringside and I turned my back </v>

1253
00:54:08.361 --> 00:54:09.090
<v Speaker 2>and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a first round,</v>

1254
00:54:09.091 --> 00:54:14.091
<v Speaker 2>10 seconds in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm already hearing the punches behind </v>

1255
00:54:14.091 --> 00:54:14.091
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1256
00:54:14.091 --> 00:54:16.940
<v Speaker 2>oh fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to run around and get my ass over </v>

1257
00:54:16.940 --> 00:54:16.980
<v Speaker 2>there as quick as I can because it's go </v>
<v Speaker 2>another round.</v>

1258
00:54:17.330 --> 00:54:22.330
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in a good fight and you can hear </v>

1259
00:54:22.330 --> 00:54:22.650
<v Speaker 2>those punches landing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just ridiculous like the power that</v>

1260
00:54:22.651 --> 00:54:24.350
<v Speaker 2>they generate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But tisa is a monster.</v>

1261
00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:26.610
<v Speaker 2>Puts those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a monster.</v>

1262
00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:30.630
<v Speaker 2>He's the way he keeps coming and coming </v>
<v Speaker 2>and moving and throwing bombs.</v>

1263
00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:32.640
<v Speaker 2>But jesus would've fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was.</v>

1264
00:54:33.060 --> 00:54:33.750
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the.</v>

1265
00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:37.400
<v Speaker 2>And the cool thing about that was I like</v>
<v Speaker 2>roselawn at,</v>

1266
00:54:37.560 --> 00:54:40.200
<v Speaker 2>but the last,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fights year prior to that,</v>

1267
00:54:40.220 --> 00:54:41.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he attended,</v>

1268
00:54:41.011 --> 00:54:44.790
<v Speaker 2>had a tendency to fade after three or </v>
<v Speaker 2>four rounds and whatever that was,</v>

1269
00:54:44.791 --> 00:54:46.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>focus or conditioning,</v>

1270
00:54:46.711 --> 00:54:47.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1271
00:54:47.220 --> 00:54:50.520
<v Speaker 2>But even if his mental focus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to condition that as well.</v>

1272
00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:55.820
<v Speaker 2>And so this training camp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really dedicated a lot of time to </v>

1273
00:54:56.040 --> 00:54:59.490
<v Speaker 2>learning how to push him into the later </v>
<v Speaker 2>rounds and get into bringing it more and</v>

1274
00:54:59.491 --> 00:55:00.990
<v Speaker 2>more as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a fiber grass.</v>

1275
00:55:01.350 --> 00:55:04.410
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm freddie roach trained sim as </v>
<v Speaker 2>boxing.</v>

1276
00:55:04.610 --> 00:55:08.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what was like freddy's assessment of</v>

1277
00:55:08.581 --> 00:55:13.581
<v Speaker 2>like the difference in his performance </v>
<v Speaker 2>from training with you is what we can </v>

1278
00:55:13.771 --> 00:55:16.920
<v Speaker 2>get out of him in the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He looked great.</v>

1279
00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:21.980
<v Speaker 2>Everybody was pleased with his barring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this time they said this is the </v>

1280
00:55:21.980 --> 00:55:24.711
<v Speaker 2>best he's ever looked in inspiring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like phenomenal and a renaissance of </v>

1281
00:55:24.940 --> 00:55:25.860
<v Speaker 2>kind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kinda like a robot.</v>

1282
00:55:25.861 --> 00:55:30.861
<v Speaker 2>Like whatever he does inspiring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's pretty much going to do on the </v>

1283
00:55:30.861 --> 00:55:30.861
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so even in sparring he would come on</v>

1284
00:55:30.861 --> 00:55:33.690
<v Speaker 2>a little slow and then pick it up </v>
<v Speaker 2>towards the later rounds of sparring.</v>

1285
00:55:34.230 --> 00:55:35.410
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>

1286
00:55:35.411 --> 00:55:37.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it surprised anybody in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the performance.</v>

1287
00:55:37.351 --> 00:55:38.760
<v Speaker 2>Like freddy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he even said in the beginning,</v>

1288
00:55:38.761 --> 00:55:39.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a 50 slash 50 fight,</v>

1289
00:55:39.961 --> 00:55:41.400
<v Speaker 2>like I don't know who's going to win </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

1290
00:55:41.740 --> 00:55:43.050
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be honest,</v>

1291
00:55:43.051 --> 00:55:48.051
<v Speaker 2>that fight went down exactly how I </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought I would exactly in the dressing </v>

1292
00:55:48.051 --> 00:55:50.630
<v Speaker 2>room before we walked out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said to the ra,</v>

1293
00:55:50.670 --> 00:55:52.290
<v Speaker 2>I pulled the ref aside and I asked him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1294
00:55:52.291 --> 00:55:57.291
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look what happens if he gets head </v>

1295
00:55:57.291 --> 00:55:57.810
<v Speaker 2>butting in like first or second round,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shit you not.</v>

1296
00:55:57.811 --> 00:55:59.340
<v Speaker 2>I asked him that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1297
00:55:59.510 --> 00:56:01.230
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you going to stop the fight?</v>

1298
00:56:01.231 --> 00:56:03.270
<v Speaker 2>He going to have him check it or You </v>
<v Speaker 2>gonna let him keep fighting.</v>

1299
00:56:03.271 --> 00:56:04.080
<v Speaker 2>If there's blood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1300
00:56:04.081 --> 00:56:06.840
<v Speaker 2>I just want to get some things clear </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I kind of had this weird feeling</v>

1301
00:56:07.260 --> 00:56:08.630
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure enough,</v>

1302
00:56:08.670 --> 00:56:12.350
<v Speaker 2>second round and I had a feeling matina </v>
<v Speaker 2>is going to win by decision and I just,</v>

1303
00:56:12.780 --> 00:56:14.280
<v Speaker 2>sometimes you just get that weird </v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling,</v>

1304
00:56:14.281 --> 00:56:16.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an aura and a,</v>

1305
00:56:17.070 --> 00:56:19.170
<v Speaker 2>you can put all the work and you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

1306
00:56:19.171 --> 00:56:22.170
<v Speaker 2>like if it's not your night and it's not</v>
<v Speaker 2>your night and there's just something.</v>

1307
00:56:22.690 --> 00:56:24.220
<v Speaker 2>So there now provided</v>

1308
00:56:24.230 --> 00:56:26.810
<v Speaker 1>a cough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What kind of diet does that guy follow?</v>

1309
00:56:26.811 --> 00:56:30.640
<v Speaker 1>Because I'd read some crazy shit about </v>
<v Speaker 1>like until he was like,</v>

1310
00:56:31.090 --> 00:56:31.600
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had,</v>

1311
00:56:31.630 --> 00:56:34.950
<v Speaker 1>he'd only eaten raw meat and now he </v>
<v Speaker 1>still eats raw meat.</v>

1312
00:56:35.140 --> 00:56:37.470
<v Speaker 1>Really not when he's here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has a,</v>

1313
00:56:37.510 --> 00:56:42.510
<v Speaker 1>he has a nutritionist here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but where does he like when he's inside </v>

1314
00:56:42.510 --> 00:56:42.640
<v Speaker 1>barrier barrier?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1315
00:56:42.670 --> 00:56:44.770
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They sell it like in his talent.</v>

1316
00:56:44.771 --> 00:56:46.330
<v Speaker 1>I guess they sell it in restaurants and </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

1317
00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:47.920
<v Speaker 1>Like you can go into a restaurant and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just go,</v>

1318
00:56:47.921 --> 00:56:49.060
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll have a moose heart.</v>

1319
00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:52.540
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1320
00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:55.510
<v Speaker 1>So they all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all used to eating raw meat.</v>

1321
00:56:56.020 --> 00:56:57.880
<v Speaker 1>They're like eskimos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1322
00:56:57.940 --> 00:57:00.580
<v Speaker 1>They're really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're really ahead of the times.</v>

1323
00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:04.420
<v Speaker 1>Well there's something to be said for </v>
<v Speaker 1>those genetics,</v>

1324
00:57:04.421 --> 00:57:05.180
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1325
00:57:05.470 --> 00:57:10.470
<v Speaker 1>Because those are some fucking stout </v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings and that diet has got to be</v>

1326
00:57:10.721 --> 00:57:12.940
<v Speaker 1>like incredibly nutrient dense protein.</v>

1327
00:57:12.940 --> 00:57:15.040
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're in as long as you're eating,</v>

1328
00:57:15.070 --> 00:57:17.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>game animals and not predators,</v>

1329
00:57:17.141 --> 00:57:19.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can pretty much get away with that.</v>

1330
00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:21.820
<v Speaker 1>They were eAting bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously you couldn't eat it raw,</v>

1331
00:57:21.821 --> 00:57:24.390
<v Speaker 1>but eating a caribou or something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1332
00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:25.930
<v Speaker 1>Raw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're reading it fine.</v>

1333
00:57:26.260 --> 00:57:27.700
<v Speaker 1>I've eaten cariboU before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1334
00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:29.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1335
00:57:30.220 --> 00:57:31.990
<v Speaker 1>I'd be interested to try that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very.</v>

1336
00:57:31.991 --> 00:57:35.380
<v Speaker 1>It's reindeer reindeer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like santa has reindeer.</v>

1337
00:57:35.381 --> 00:57:37.210
<v Speaker 1>There's caribou.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Elk.</v>

1338
00:57:37.820 --> 00:57:40.130
<v Speaker 1>Elk is delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had a.</v>

1339
00:57:40.131 --> 00:57:44.770
<v Speaker 1>I've had raw horse in montreal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a horse tartare.</v>

1340
00:57:45.460 --> 00:57:50.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ground up this raw horse and served </v>

1341
00:57:50.460 --> 00:57:51.050
<v Speaker 1>it with like egg on it and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like raw egg on it.</v>

1342
00:57:51.051 --> 00:57:52.430
<v Speaker 1>It was a manager saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1343
00:57:52.450 --> 00:57:54.340
<v Speaker 1>there's thIs place called joe beef and </v>
<v Speaker 1>montreal.</v>

1344
00:57:54.460 --> 00:57:56.100
<v Speaker 1>Is that fresh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

1345
00:57:56.110 --> 00:57:57.220
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do that.</v>

1346
00:57:57.230 --> 00:57:59.020
<v Speaker 1>Do they kill the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1347
00:57:59.590 --> 00:58:01.300
<v Speaker 1>Fresh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd think that they'd killed the whole</v>

1348
00:58:01.301 --> 00:58:06.301
<v Speaker 1>horse and some little would spoil or do </v>
<v Speaker 1>they just like take off limbs at a time </v>

1349
00:58:06.301 --> 00:58:06.520
<v Speaker 1>and then like is a good question?</v>

1350
00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:08.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the thing I don't know,</v>

1351
00:58:09.010 --> 00:58:12.230
<v Speaker 1>when you buy beef that you buy from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stores fresh,</v>

1352
00:58:12.900 --> 00:58:15.730
<v Speaker 1>they're not freezing your stakes for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most part.</v>

1353
00:58:15.731 --> 00:58:20.731
<v Speaker 1>Some fish is frozen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but almost all beef you're buying is </v>

1354
00:58:20.731 --> 00:58:22.870
<v Speaker 1>been killed fairly recently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of it's dry aged,</v>

1355
00:58:22.900 --> 00:58:24.910
<v Speaker 1>but this was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this horse was,</v>

1356
00:58:24.940 --> 00:58:26.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I actually,</v>

1357
00:58:26.171 --> 00:58:31.171
<v Speaker 1>they killed a horse in America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't sell it in America in </v>

1358
00:58:31.171 --> 00:58:34.861
<v Speaker 1>stores,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can kill them in America and </v>

1359
00:58:34.861 --> 00:58:34.861
<v Speaker 1>then they export them to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to Canada.</v>

1360
00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:36.310
<v Speaker 1>It's very tricky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1361
00:58:36.311 --> 00:58:40.660
<v Speaker 1>because people have very strong </v>
<v Speaker 1>attachments towards them as animals,</v>

1362
00:58:40.661 --> 00:58:41.860
<v Speaker 1>as pets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1363
00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:45.520
<v Speaker 1>But a delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although weird,</v>

1364
00:58:45.550 --> 00:58:47.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any horse horse,</v>

1365
00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:50.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not about to eat a dog provider.</v>

1366
00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:51.520
<v Speaker 1>Worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Might trip me out.</v>

1367
00:58:51.790 --> 00:58:53.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's with the cats?</v>

1368
00:58:53.651 --> 00:58:55.570
<v Speaker 1>I think I saw a picture of your cats or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

1369
00:58:55.570 --> 00:58:59.400
<v Speaker 1>You got cats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>girl.</v>

1370
00:59:00.430 --> 00:59:02.500
<v Speaker 1>I've always had cats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a 19 year old cat.</v>

1371
00:59:03.270 --> 00:59:04.780
<v Speaker 1>I've had her since she was a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1372
00:59:05.240 --> 00:59:06.340
<v Speaker 1>is that bad?</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1373
00:59:06.420 --> 00:59:11.060
<v Speaker 1>So it's just different when you try to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seemed like a macho guy.</v>

1374
00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:16.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm balanced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to get in touch with the feminine </v>

1375
00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:16.920
<v Speaker 1>side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Touch with my feminine side.</v>

1376
00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:18.340
<v Speaker 1>I like little dogs too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that okay?</v>

1377
00:59:18.400 --> 00:59:19.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>

1378
00:59:19.290 --> 00:59:21.050
<v Speaker 1>What if I have a little dog in a purse?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I carry it around.</v>

1379
00:59:22.360 --> 00:59:24.110
<v Speaker 1>Batman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think you're pushing.</v>

1380
00:59:24.680 --> 00:59:26.060
<v Speaker 1>Chuck liddell does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Desi,</v>

1381
00:59:26.090 --> 00:59:28.970
<v Speaker 1>chuck odell was a little tiny chihuahua.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He used to take with them everywhere.</v>

1382

1452
01:02:25.070 --> 01:02:28.190

<v Speaker 3>It was funny,</v>

1454
01:02:29.670 --> 01:02:34.670
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't want to like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make sure she finds something that's </v>

<v Speaker 3>when she was three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was just something funny,</v>

1459
01:02:44.671 --> 01:02:46.920
<v Speaker 3>but she wasn't even doing it to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>attention or anything.</v>

1460
01:02:46.921 --> 01:02:49.710
<v Speaker 3>She's just looking her suitcase.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My wife has the helmet.</v>

1461
01:02:49.711 --> 01:02:51.000

1476
01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:33.500
<v Speaker 3>imposed upon ourselves with television </v>
<v Speaker 3>is the same censorship that we bring </v>

1477
01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:35.100
<v Speaker 3>into the household and you expect from </v>
<v Speaker 3>kids at school.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Drives me crazy because I know that it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>not like when people are alone,</v>

1497
01:04:24.721 --> 01:04:26.100
<v Speaker 3>when they're comfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they're together,</v>

1498
01:04:26.190 --> 01:04:28.920
<v Speaker 3>when they're out drinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they're at a bar or restaurant,</v>

1499
01:04:28.950 --> 01:04:31.380
<v Speaker 3>they swear and it's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's freeing.</v>

1500
01:04:31.470 --> 01:04:33.840
<v Speaker 3>It's liberating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you're in an office.</v>

1501
01:04:33.841 --> 01:04:35.790
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's dressed like a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>penguin.</v>

1502
01:04:36.030 --> 01:04:38.230
<v Speaker 3>Some weird stupid outfits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1503
01:04:38.231 --> 01:04:39.210
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's dumb.</v>

1504
01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:44.240
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean it's a weird habit that </v>

1505
01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:44.950
<v Speaker 3>we're stuck in that people think is </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1506
01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:50.240
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got a lot of class with your </v>

1507
01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:50.240
<v Speaker 3>language.</v>

1508
01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:50.240
<v Speaker 3>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shut up.</v>

1509
01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:53.580
<v Speaker 3>This is stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So dumb way to express yourself.</v>

1510
01:04:54.140 --> 01:04:55.620
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't make any sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1511
01:04:55.830 --> 01:04:59.190
<v Speaker 3>I don't really think that much about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It drives me nuts.</v>

1512
01:04:59.191 --> 01:05:01.050
<v Speaker 3>It drives me nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1513
01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:06.230
<v Speaker 3>Because I've had people come on my </v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast and I'm like the podcast,</v>

1514
01:05:06.631 --> 01:05:11.631
<v Speaker 3>like someone will say it was a great </v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast except for rogan's language and </v>

1515
01:05:11.871 --> 01:05:14.070
<v Speaker 3>my language like he.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He asked great questions.</v>

1516
01:05:14.071 --> 01:05:15.990
<v Speaker 3>If you get past the language,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a great conversation.</v>

1517
01:05:15.991 --> 01:05:17.500
<v Speaker 3>If you say it in like a foreign </v>
<v Speaker 3>language.</v>

1518
01:05:18.770 --> 01:05:19.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1519
01:05:19.391 --> 01:05:21.760
<v Speaker 3>Some the word french,</v>
<v Speaker 3>french word for fuck.</v>

1520
01:05:21.761 --> 01:05:23.450
<v Speaker 3>It's just silliness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1521
01:05:23.660 --> 01:05:28.660
<v Speaker 3>it's infant tile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's self imposed infantile </v>

1522
01:05:28.660 --> 01:05:30.280
<v Speaker 3>behavior and one year the adult,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're a grown person,</v>

1523
01:05:30.281 --> 01:05:32.080
<v Speaker 3>you're a fully grown adult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You t,</v>

1524
01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:35.530
<v Speaker 3>you pay your own bills,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you feed yourself the whole deal.</v>

1525
01:05:35.531 --> 01:05:40.531
<v Speaker 3>You decide when you go to bed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the idea that you were imposing </v>

1526
01:05:40.531 --> 01:05:40.531
<v Speaker 3>this stupid language restriction.</v>

1527
01:05:40.690 --> 01:05:45.690
<v Speaker 3>The only language I care about is </v>
<v Speaker 3>language that expresses like human </v>

1528
01:05:45.690 --> 01:05:45.690
<v Speaker 3>interaction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1529
01:05:46.260 --> 01:05:49.120
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I care about derogatory language.</v>

1530
01:05:49.121 --> 01:05:51.610
<v Speaker 3>I care about offensive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>evil language,</v>

1531
01:05:51.611 --> 01:05:53.620
<v Speaker 3>racist language.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That kind of stuff bugs me,</v>

1532
01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:56.920
<v Speaker 3>but just saying fuck the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The type of people that do that.</v>

1533
01:05:57.240 --> 01:06:00.220
<v Speaker 3>The good thing about that is if you find</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone who cares about that,</v>

1534
01:06:00.221 --> 01:06:01.810
<v Speaker 3>you know you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're around an idiot.</v>

1535
01:06:02.170 --> 01:06:05.860
<v Speaker 3>Just avoid that dummy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got a little excited,</v>

1536
01:06:06.510 --> 01:06:09.490
<v Speaker 3>I got a little carried away with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That thought we got off track.</v>

1537
01:06:09.491 --> 01:06:12.430
<v Speaker 3>That's why this podcast is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We should change the name of it too.</v>

1538
01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:16.210
<v Speaker 3>Off track.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you see in the store on sunset?</v>

1539
01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:18.430
<v Speaker 3>Pinches tacos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what that means?</v>

1540
01:06:18.460 --> 01:06:20.280
<v Speaker 3>No fucking tacos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

1541
01:06:20.330 --> 01:06:21.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good,</v>

1542
01:06:23.140 --> 01:06:24.190
<v Speaker 3>good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

1543
01:06:24.191 --> 01:06:27.820
<v Speaker 3>I hope somebody protests.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope some social justice warriors have</v>

1544
01:06:27.821 --> 01:06:29.480
<v Speaker 3>it closed down because it's racist or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

1545
01:06:29.481 --> 01:06:30.430
<v Speaker 3>I hope white people on it.</v>

1546
01:06:31.750 --> 01:06:33.120
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fun.</v>

1547
01:06:33.220 --> 01:06:35.110
<v Speaker 3>Google.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1548
01:06:35.111 --> 01:06:36.820
<v Speaker 3>I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think we're.</v>

1549
01:06:36.910 --> 01:06:38.860
<v Speaker 3>We're very childish when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 3>language.</v>

1550
01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:40.510
<v Speaker 3>That's not the point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This podcast,</v>

1551
01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:44.140
<v Speaker 3>the point is pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have just so many questions for you.</v>

1552
01:06:44.141 --> 01:06:46.300
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure I'll get back to this because </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really fascinating.</v>

1553
01:06:47.140 --> 01:06:51.580
<v Speaker 3>What do you think when you watch those </v>
<v Speaker 3>countdown shows and you see like guys do</v>

1554
01:06:51.581 --> 01:06:56.581
<v Speaker 3>with the battle ropes and there's like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>bunch of very specific things that you </v>

1555
01:06:56.581 --> 01:06:58.300
<v Speaker 3>see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see like guys pushing sleds,</v>

1556
01:06:58.301 --> 01:07:03.301
<v Speaker 3>that's a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The weight sled pushing that fucking </v>

1557
01:07:03.301 --> 01:07:03.301
<v Speaker 3>sled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1558
01:07:03.301 --> 01:07:08.011
<v Speaker 3>you see like all these different ways of</v>
<v Speaker 3>training.</v>

1559
01:07:08.450 --> 01:07:10.810
<v Speaker 3>What is like the biggest mistakes that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you see</v>

1560
01:07:12.130 --> 01:07:16.540
<v Speaker 2>or what you feel are based mistakes?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously they exercise modalities like,</v>

1561
01:07:16.541 --> 01:07:21.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how pushing a sled is even </v>
<v Speaker 2>relative to like mma.</v>

1562
01:07:21.090 --> 01:07:23.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean if we're talking about mma guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>up against the cage,</v>

1563
01:07:24.900 --> 01:07:27.370
<v Speaker 2>what if you get pushing them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you holding him?</v>

1564
01:07:27.630 --> 01:07:32.630
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're trying to push the guy up </v>

1565
01:07:32.630 --> 01:07:32.630
<v Speaker 3>against the cage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say if you get,</v>

1566
01:07:32.630 --> 01:07:32.630
<v Speaker 3>you get in a collar tie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1567
01:07:32.630 --> 01:07:32.670
<v Speaker 3>and you want to push the guy up against </v>
<v Speaker 3>the cage,</v>

1568
01:07:32.671 --> 01:07:37.671
<v Speaker 3>you want to work your entire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to work needs to the body that </v>

1569
01:07:37.671 --> 01:07:37.671
<v Speaker 3>seems</v>

1570
01:07:37.671 --> 01:07:38.210
<v Speaker 2>that would be more about leverage of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>leg,</v>

1571
01:07:38.260 --> 01:07:39.650
<v Speaker 2>the leg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the placement of the leg,</v>

1572
01:07:39.651 --> 01:07:41.240
<v Speaker 2>and the leverage and the power of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>foot,</v>

1573
01:07:41.241 --> 01:07:43.160
<v Speaker 2>which I take it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we go back to.</v>

1574
01:07:43.161 --> 01:07:46.160
<v Speaker 2>The strength and the feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The feet of the strength of the foot can</v>

1575
01:07:46.161 --> 01:07:51.161
<v Speaker 2>not be understated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've done studies like on olympic </v>

1576
01:07:51.161 --> 01:07:53.950
<v Speaker 2>weight lifters that show that the force,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1577
01:07:53.990 --> 01:07:58.990
<v Speaker 2>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the foot actually produces the greatest </v>

1578
01:07:58.990 --> 01:07:58.990
<v Speaker 2>amount of force and the olympic weight </v>
<v Speaker 2>lifts.</v>

1579
01:07:58.990 --> 01:07:58.990
<v Speaker 2>So real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1580
01:07:59.350 --> 01:08:02.180
<v Speaker 2>it's the actual foot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look at the leverage of the joint</v>

1581
01:08:02.181 --> 01:08:03.650
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just such a short lever.</v>

1582
01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:07.460
<v Speaker 2>So the pushing off the ground for clean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1583
01:08:08.090 --> 01:08:10.670
<v Speaker 2>That produces more forced than,</v>
<v Speaker 2>than,</v>

1584
01:08:10.730 --> 01:08:12.980
<v Speaker 2>than the quadricep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even even the hip.</v>

1585
01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:14.150
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1586
01:08:14.650 --> 01:08:15.450
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1587
01:08:15.530 --> 01:08:18.160
<v Speaker 2>are you opposed to cleans and presses </v>
<v Speaker 2>and things along that?</v>

1588
01:08:18.180 --> 01:08:23.120
<v Speaker 2>I'll have my guys do them and I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to say there are terrible.</v>

1589
01:08:23.310 --> 01:08:25.340
<v Speaker 2>I think if you start going too heavy </v>
<v Speaker 2>then yeah,</v>

1590
01:08:25.341 --> 01:08:30.341
<v Speaker 2>you're overloading your spine and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing a disservice to the rest of your </v>

1591
01:08:30.341 --> 01:08:31.340
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like what's too heavy?</v>

1592
01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:35.540
<v Speaker 2>I think something that you can't do </v>
<v Speaker 2>quickly and incorporate the stretch,</v>

1593
01:08:35.750 --> 01:08:38.270
<v Speaker 2>the stretch shortening cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>

1594
01:08:38.271 --> 01:08:40.670
<v Speaker 2>plyometrics in my opinion are the king </v>
<v Speaker 2>for strength,</v>

1595
01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:44.450
<v Speaker 2>for strengthening the body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So box jumps,</v>

1596
01:08:45.140 --> 01:08:50.140
<v Speaker 2>those type of exercises.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were you doing the descending exact </v>

1597
01:08:50.140 --> 01:08:53.630
<v Speaker 2>press and catching it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything where the muscles being put on </v>

1598
01:08:53.630 --> 01:08:54.980
<v Speaker 2>stretch and then firing back at a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at a faster rate.</v>

1599
01:08:55.130 --> 01:08:58.190
<v Speaker 2>So you can even do that manually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like to exercise for the hips.</v>

1600
01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:03.520
<v Speaker 2>You can do that with a hand throwing the</v>
<v Speaker 2>leg down and work it in different </v>

1601
01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:04.220
<v Speaker 2>angles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So imagine strengthening every muscle in</v>

1602
01:09:04.221 --> 01:09:09.221
<v Speaker 2>your body plan metrically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you've got like a fast twitch </v>

1603
01:09:09.221 --> 01:09:09.221
<v Speaker 2>animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's highly trained.</v>

1604
01:09:10.070 --> 01:09:15.070
<v Speaker 2>Can you take a guy who's slow and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can make them fast solutely there's </v>

1605
01:09:15.270 --> 01:09:17.180
<v Speaker 2>through the stretch shortening cycle </v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1606
01:09:17.181 --> 01:09:20.100
<v Speaker 2>which is the neural neural impulses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1607
01:09:20.101 --> 01:09:23.720
<v Speaker 2>that go through the muscle and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>stretch shortening cycle actually,</v>

1608
01:09:23.770 --> 01:09:25.820
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me give you an example of this.</v>

1609
01:09:25.850 --> 01:09:29.480
<v Speaker 2>So imagine you go to the doctor and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're sitting in the doctor's chair and</v>

1610
01:09:29.481 --> 01:09:31.460
<v Speaker 2>he comes up and he hits you in the knee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1611
01:09:31.461 --> 01:09:34.640
<v Speaker 2>he does the patellar tests to kick test.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a stretch shortening cycle.</v>

1612
01:09:34.641 --> 01:09:35.570
<v Speaker 2>And what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what he's doing,</v>

1613
01:09:35.571 --> 01:09:39.530
<v Speaker 2>he's testing for any kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>abnormalities like that might be in your</v>

1614
01:09:39.531 --> 01:09:42.140
<v Speaker 2>spine or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or might show up in your nervous system.</v>

1615
01:09:42.141 --> 01:09:44.300
<v Speaker 2>It could be some other kind of disease </v>
<v Speaker 2>or whatever.</v>

1616
01:09:44.750 --> 01:09:47.390
<v Speaker 2>But what it's doing is it's sending a </v>
<v Speaker 2>neural impulse through the,</v>

1617
01:09:47.420 --> 01:09:49.030
<v Speaker 2>through the tendon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1618
01:09:49.730 --> 01:09:51.230
<v Speaker 2>All the way up through the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>through the muscle,</v>

1619
01:09:51.231 --> 01:09:56.231
<v Speaker 2>into the spine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then inhibits the hamstring so it </v>

1620
01:09:56.231 --> 01:09:56.450
<v Speaker 2>switches the hamstring off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1621
01:09:56.451 --> 01:10:01.451
<v Speaker 2>And that's why your leg jerks without </v>
<v Speaker 2>you even having to try to do anything </v>

1622
01:10:01.451 --> 01:10:01.451
<v Speaker 2>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>

1623
01:10:01.451 --> 01:10:01.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just sit there,</v>

1624
01:10:01.551 --> 01:10:04.020
<v Speaker 2>you're not making a kick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's what's going on.</v>

1625
01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:06.230
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So exactly.</v>

1626
01:10:06.231 --> 01:10:07.840
<v Speaker 2>So if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you hit the hand,</v>

1627
01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:09.760
<v Speaker 2>if he hit the right in the patellar </v>
<v Speaker 2>tendon,</v>

1628
01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:14.920
<v Speaker 2>your leg kicks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's actually switching off your </v>

1629
01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:16.460
<v Speaker 2>hamstring simultaneously at the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1630
01:10:16.461 --> 01:10:19.640
<v Speaker 2>It's activating the quadricep so you get</v>
<v Speaker 2>a greater,</v>

1631
01:10:19.670 --> 01:10:22.790
<v Speaker 2>you get a greater contraction now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the quadricep without even trying.</v>

1632
01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:25.280
<v Speaker 2>That's where the efficiency that you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>been talking about comes in.</v>

1633
01:10:26.030 --> 01:10:28.610
<v Speaker 2>So by training the stretch shortening </v>
<v Speaker 2>cycle,</v>

1634
01:10:28.850 --> 01:10:33.850
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can duplicate that throughout the </v>

1635
01:10:33.850 --> 01:10:34.040
<v Speaker 2>entire body as long as you're training </v>
<v Speaker 2>every muscle like that.</v>

1636
01:10:34.670 --> 01:10:39.670
<v Speaker 2>So do you have like a standard mma </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighter protocol that you follow or does</v>

1637
01:10:39.891 --> 01:10:43.820
<v Speaker 2>it vary depending upon what the athlete </v>
<v Speaker 2>brings to you in the first place?</v>

1638
01:10:44.020 --> 01:10:47.960
<v Speaker 2>Do or do you try to get them to a place </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then work from there?</v>

1639
01:10:48.050 --> 01:10:49.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

1640
01:10:49.460 --> 01:10:54.460
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we start with muscle testing to </v>

1641
01:10:54.460 --> 01:10:54.460
<v Speaker 2>determine weaknesses like the feet and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the hips.</v>

1642
01:10:54.460 --> 01:10:55.070
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you do this muscle?</v>

1643
01:10:55.150 --> 01:10:56.730
<v Speaker 2>Manual testing per,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1644
01:10:56.810 --> 01:10:58.790
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all hold your toes and I'll have you try</v>

1645
01:10:58.791 --> 01:11:02.170
<v Speaker 2>to push me back and I'll feel like it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a manual muscle test like something</v>

1646
01:11:02.180 --> 01:11:07.180
<v Speaker 2>a chiropractor might do or our physical </v>
<v Speaker 2>therapists and looking for weaknesses </v>

1647
01:11:07.250 --> 01:11:12.250
<v Speaker 2>and then the hips.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can test the abduction and </v>

1648
01:11:12.250 --> 01:11:12.250
<v Speaker 2>adduction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can turn the person over and you can</v>

1649
01:11:12.250 --> 01:11:13.890
<v Speaker 2>test the rotation of their hip here </v>
<v Speaker 2>which is.</v>

1650
01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:18.570
<v Speaker 2>And all these things play into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanics of sporting movement,</v>

1651
01:11:18.571 --> 01:11:21.360
<v Speaker 2>so the rotational muscles of the hip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you've got,</v>

1652
01:11:21.361 --> 01:11:26.361
<v Speaker 2>let's say you're right handed and you've</v>
<v Speaker 2>got weak rotational muscles in the eye </v>

1653
01:11:26.361 --> 01:11:28.140
<v Speaker 2>and the left and your left leg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's going to affect your left hook,</v>

1654
01:11:28.830 --> 01:11:30.270
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same with the right hand,</v>

1655
01:11:30.300 --> 01:11:31.110
<v Speaker 2>straight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right hand.</v>

1656
01:11:31.350 --> 01:11:33.480
<v Speaker 2>If you got a weak gluten ham </v>
<v Speaker 2>contraction,</v>

1657
01:11:33.780 --> 01:11:38.780
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have a a weakness in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your straight right hand if you're </v>

1658
01:11:38.780 --> 01:11:43.191
<v Speaker 2>punching from the hip,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean assuming you're punching with </v>

1659
01:11:43.191 --> 01:11:43.191
<v Speaker 2>good mechanics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1660
01:11:43.191 --> 01:11:45.450
<v Speaker 2>And so all these factors play into where</v>
<v Speaker 2>we want to get them.</v>

1661
01:11:46.140 --> 01:11:49.440
<v Speaker 2>So first you would remediate the weakest</v>
<v Speaker 2>link first.</v>

1662
01:11:49.860 --> 01:11:51.960
<v Speaker 2>So 99 times out of 100,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the feet.</v>

1663
01:11:51.961 --> 01:11:56.961
<v Speaker 2>And the hips with the guys and then like</v>
<v Speaker 2>usually the lower back and the </v>

1664
01:11:56.961 --> 01:11:57.570
<v Speaker 2>shoulders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you get like,</v>

1665
01:11:57.571 --> 01:12:02.571
<v Speaker 2>watch the video that I remember gary I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think is explaining it when he trained </v>

1666
01:12:02.571 --> 01:12:02.750
<v Speaker 2>bj penn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you know,</v>

1667
01:12:02.790 --> 01:12:07.790
<v Speaker 2>first we fixed his feet and then his </v>
<v Speaker 2>hips and it's the same strategy for </v>

1668
01:12:07.790 --> 01:12:08.810
<v Speaker 2>remediating weakness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you want to,</v>

1669
01:12:09.340 --> 01:12:14.340
<v Speaker 2>you want to strengthen all these weak </v>
<v Speaker 2>links first to get the kinetic chain </v>

1670
01:12:14.340 --> 01:12:14.370
<v Speaker 2>working,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know all the way through.</v>

1671
01:12:14.410 --> 01:12:14.790
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

1672
01:12:15.350 --> 01:12:20.350
<v Speaker 1>So if you get a guy and say the guy has </v>
<v Speaker 1>lower back issues is really common with </v>

1673
01:12:20.350 --> 01:12:21.900
<v Speaker 1>bj players,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brazilian jujitsu guys that work,</v>

1674
01:12:21.901 --> 01:12:26.901
<v Speaker 1>the guard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially a lot of them have lower </v>

1675
01:12:26.901 --> 01:12:26.901
<v Speaker 1>eddie bravo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1676
01:12:26.901 --> 01:12:27.810
<v Speaker 1>He's just serious lower back problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would you do</v>

1677
01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:33.320
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all I'd probably want to turn </v>

1678
01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:36.200
<v Speaker 2>them over and fill with his spine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Feels like and feel for,</v>

1679
01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:38.900
<v Speaker 2>for what the vertebraes lined up like </v>
<v Speaker 2>and his hips.</v>

1680
01:12:39.230 --> 01:12:40.270
<v Speaker 2>And then I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I do</v>

1681
01:12:40.420 --> 01:12:42.500
<v Speaker 1>visual assessment of his lower back and </v>
<v Speaker 1>tests.</v>

1682
01:12:42.550 --> 01:12:44.200
<v Speaker 1>He's extremely flexible guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1683
01:12:44.410 --> 01:12:46.180
<v Speaker 1>In some ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tight hamstrings.</v>

1684
01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:47.470
<v Speaker 1>So tight hamstrings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1685
01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:49.210
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a guy that's fucked up.</v>

1686
01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:50.920
<v Speaker 1>I can probably fix them up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No problem.</v>

1687
01:12:50.970 --> 01:12:51.940
<v Speaker 1>You think so?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

1688
01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:53.680
<v Speaker 1>Guaranteed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eddie bravo.</v>

1689
01:12:53.830 --> 01:12:54.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where are you?</v>

1690
01:12:54.281 --> 01:12:54.850
<v Speaker 1>Gonna?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Call nick.</v>

1691
01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:55.450
<v Speaker 1>Let's go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eddie.</v>

1692
01:12:56.530 --> 01:12:58.000
<v Speaker 1>I think I trained with him a long time </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>

1693
01:12:58.001 --> 01:13:00.100
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He used to wear the head gear and like a</v>

1694
01:13:00.101 --> 01:13:01.630
<v Speaker 1>wetsuit thing on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1695
01:13:02.090 --> 01:13:03.650
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1696
01:13:03.710 --> 01:13:06.030
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was probably like 15 years ago when</v>

1697
01:13:06.031 --> 01:13:08.730
<v Speaker 1>he had really long hair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He used to tuck in a wetsuit.</v>

1698
01:13:08.900 --> 01:13:10.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was pretty cool guy.</v>

1699
01:13:11.450 --> 01:13:12.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's awesome.</v>

1700
01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:14.350
<v Speaker 1>He's a character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but his,</v>

1701
01:13:14.351 --> 01:13:16.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his flexibility's very unusual.</v>

1702
01:13:16.751 --> 01:13:19.060
<v Speaker 1>His leg dexter is very unusual in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hips.</v>

1703
01:13:19.270 --> 01:13:20.630
<v Speaker 1>His ability to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1704
01:13:21.150 --> 01:13:24.100
<v Speaker 1>like when you called jail break,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like say if you have them inside control</v>

1705
01:13:24.101 --> 01:13:29.101
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can pick his foot up without even </v>

1706
01:13:29.101 --> 01:13:29.101
<v Speaker 1>grabbing with his hand.</v>

1707
01:13:29.101 --> 01:13:29.101
<v Speaker 1>Bring it across like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1708
01:13:29.101 --> 01:13:31.300
<v Speaker 1>Get a deep butterfly hook and in turn </v>
<v Speaker 1>and face you.</v>

1709
01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:32.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

1710
01:13:33.850 --> 01:13:36.120
<v Speaker 1>It's an amazing dexterity that he has </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

1711
01:13:36.121 --> 01:13:41.121
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee I can fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fixed nfl player's backs and those </v>

1712
01:13:41.121 --> 01:13:44.701
<v Speaker 1>guys have the worst backs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So savvy guy get a guy who's got some </v>

1713
01:13:44.701 --> 01:13:45.400
<v Speaker 1>bulging disks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of shit going on.</v>

1714
01:13:46.190 --> 01:13:51.190
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of sketchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I don't want to be sued for </v>

1715
01:13:51.190 --> 01:13:51.190
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean,</v>

1716
01:13:51.190 --> 01:13:55.261
<v Speaker 1>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are some tricks like traction </v>

1717
01:13:55.261 --> 01:13:57.511
<v Speaker 1>stretches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do like some manual therapy </v>

1718
01:13:57.511 --> 01:13:57.511
<v Speaker 1>stuff that I've learned from a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1719
01:13:57.511 --> 01:13:57.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1720
01:13:57.940 --> 01:13:59.260
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well respected,</v>

1721
01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:01.870
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neurologist and physiologists,</v>

1722
01:14:02.380 --> 01:14:07.060
<v Speaker 1>crazy russian guy scientists and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we've implemented a lot of that stuff</v>

1723
01:14:07.061 --> 01:14:08.650
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the health of the spine.</v>

1724
01:14:09.220 --> 01:14:10.360
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1725
01:14:10.361 --> 01:14:11.980
<v Speaker 1>there's some stuff you do to relieve the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pressure</v>

1726
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:16.600
<v Speaker 2>there because back and neck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are really common with grapplers.</v>

1727
01:14:16.601 --> 01:14:19.300
<v Speaker 2>So I know so many wrestlers who have </v>
<v Speaker 2>fused disks,</v>

1728
01:14:19.630 --> 01:14:22.270
<v Speaker 2>like tito ortiz,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's got three fused.</v>

1729
01:14:22.510 --> 01:14:27.510
<v Speaker 2>He's got one in his neck fuse and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think he's got to and it's back one of </v>

1730
01:14:27.510 --> 01:14:28.930
<v Speaker 2>his lumbar and maybe one thoracic or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

1731
01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:34.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to have the steroid injections in </v>

1732
01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:34.000
<v Speaker 2>my neck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dji herniated discs,</v>

1733
01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.850
<v Speaker 2>five gen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty aggro back then.</v>

1734
01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:40.510
<v Speaker 2>And so I had the cortisone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1735
01:14:40.511 --> 01:14:41.240
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are they,</v>

1736
01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:42.730
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they put you to sleep for that?</v>

1737
01:14:42.790 --> 01:14:43.720
<v Speaker 2>Is that the cortisone?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1738
01:14:43.721 --> 01:14:44.520
<v Speaker 2>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1739
01:14:44.530 --> 01:14:45.910
<v Speaker 2>they put me under for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1740
01:14:45.911 --> 01:14:46.970
<v Speaker 2>And it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

1741
01:14:47.380 --> 01:14:52.380
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't sleep for three weeks before </v>

1742
01:14:52.380 --> 01:14:52.380
<v Speaker 2>I had the shots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I was up in so much pain.</v>

1743
01:14:52.630 --> 01:14:54.820
<v Speaker 2>My atrophied,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looked like a wet noodle.</v>

1744
01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:57.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you had a pretty good one.</v>

1745
01:14:57.550 --> 01:14:59.060
<v Speaker 2>What happened to your neck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1746
01:14:59.110 --> 01:15:03.400
<v Speaker 2>I got thrown into a wall and jujitsu and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just crunched,</v>

1747
01:15:03.401 --> 01:15:06.400
<v Speaker 2>but I think it was more like years and </v>
<v Speaker 2>years of building up,</v>

1748
01:15:06.401 --> 01:15:11.401
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they found there's like a bone </v>

1749
01:15:11.401 --> 01:15:13.621
<v Speaker 2>spur in there that like irritates the </v>
<v Speaker 2>nerve and so they have to go in there </v>

1750
01:15:13.621 --> 01:15:14.860
<v Speaker 2>and take the bone spur out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I probably will one day,</v>

1751
01:15:14.861 --> 01:15:19.150
<v Speaker 2>but not yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have so many friends that have atrophy</v>

1752
01:15:19.151 --> 01:15:22.920
<v Speaker 2>issues with the neck where their arm </v>
<v Speaker 2>shrinks.</v>

1753
01:15:22.980 --> 01:15:24.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bas rutten.</v>

1754
01:15:24.461 --> 01:15:26.550
<v Speaker 2>He had his neck fused.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

1755
01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:29.530
<v Speaker 2>he actually had some significant neck </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems for years.</v>

1756
01:15:29.710 --> 01:15:33.250
<v Speaker 2>And then he was on thinkers on sons of </v>
<v Speaker 2>anarchy,</v>

1757
01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:38.280
<v Speaker 2>one of those shows where he was doing a </v>
<v Speaker 2>stunt and they throw them on his head </v>

1758
01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:39.760
<v Speaker 2>and just cried,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1759
01:15:39.770 --> 01:15:44.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And his arm just went foreign and then </v>

1760
01:15:44.770 --> 01:15:44.770
<v Speaker 2>it shrunk up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boy calls it baby arm.</v>

1761
01:15:44.770 --> 01:15:46.150
<v Speaker 2>He's got one arm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's still to this day,</v>

1762
01:15:46.151 --> 01:15:47.290
<v Speaker 2>hasn't romoland.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1763
01:15:47.291 --> 01:15:50.890
<v Speaker 2>he had several operations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has disc fused in his neck.</v>

1764
01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:52.430
<v Speaker 2>He uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had um,</v>

1765
01:15:52.490 --> 01:15:55.030
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the nerve opening.</v>

1766
01:15:55.330 --> 01:15:57.820
<v Speaker 2>They go in there and they sort of carve </v>
<v Speaker 2>it out,</v>

1767
01:15:57.960 --> 01:16:02.960
<v Speaker 2>clear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clear the opening to relieve the </v>

1768
01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:05.341
<v Speaker 2>pressure on the nerve and even that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he probably did it all too late in </v>

1769
01:16:05.861 --> 01:16:10.861
<v Speaker 2>his arm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had been atrophied for so many years </v>

1770
01:16:10.861 --> 01:16:10.861
<v Speaker 2>that it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1771
01:16:10.861 --> 01:16:13.480
<v Speaker 2>it's a long process to rebuild the </v>
<v Speaker 2>neuromag I know about that.</v>

1772
01:16:13.990 --> 01:16:15.040
<v Speaker 2>There's out for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1773
01:16:15.130 --> 01:16:18.310
<v Speaker 2>well I was in a car accident till where </v>
<v Speaker 2>I was actually rear ended.</v>

1774
01:16:18.311 --> 01:16:19.990
<v Speaker 2>That guy was going about 100 miles an </v>
<v Speaker 2>hour.</v>

1775
01:16:20.060 --> 01:16:21.130
<v Speaker 2>Geez.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1776
01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:24.220
<v Speaker 2>So shattered my pelvis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>broke my hip.</v>

1777
01:16:24.221 --> 01:16:26.110
<v Speaker 2>I've got a plate in there now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a steel plate.</v>

1778
01:16:26.310 --> 01:16:27.070
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1779
01:16:27.071 --> 01:16:29.560
<v Speaker 2>And so I was in a wheelchair for like </v>
<v Speaker 2>six months,</v>

1780
01:16:30.010 --> 01:16:33.820
<v Speaker 2>but the nerve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like apart from all the muscular,</v>

1781
01:16:33.850 --> 01:16:35.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rebuilding the muscular,</v>

1782
01:16:35.210 --> 01:16:38.680
<v Speaker 2>the muscles and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the nerve pain from the recovery was the</v>

1783
01:16:38.681 --> 01:16:39.250
<v Speaker 2>worst.</v>

1784
01:16:39.310 --> 01:16:41.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean I still have like right now I can</v>
<v Speaker 2>fill it up my foot.</v>

1785
01:16:41.350 --> 01:16:46.350
<v Speaker 2>This is like 10 or 12 years ago and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>just felt like animals were eating my </v>

1786
01:16:46.350 --> 01:16:50.371
<v Speaker 2>toes off man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember waking up one night like </v>

1787
01:16:50.371 --> 01:16:52.651
<v Speaker 2>screaming in pain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like fuck did my foot as something </v>

1788
01:16:52.651 --> 01:16:54.220
<v Speaker 2>eating my foot and I looked down there </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the toes are kind of moving on their</v>

1789
01:16:54.221 --> 01:16:56.860
<v Speaker 2>own and that was the nerve waking back </v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

1790
01:16:56.990 --> 01:16:59.290
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was excruciating.</v>

1791
01:16:59.291 --> 01:17:01.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean even like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even to this day I still feel it,</v>

1792
01:17:01.931 --> 01:17:03.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get some issues in my toes with that.</v>

1793
01:17:03.791 --> 01:17:07.510
<v Speaker 2>But that's why a lot of guys didn't have</v>
<v Speaker 2>back pains and women as well.</v>

1794
01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:11.150
<v Speaker 2>Obviously they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get really hooked on pain pills.</v>

1795
01:17:11.570 --> 01:17:13.680
<v Speaker 2>It's like it gets to a point where I got</v>
<v Speaker 2>hooked on them,</v>

1796
01:17:13.681 --> 01:17:18.681
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not gonna lie to the point where I </v>

1797
01:17:18.681 --> 01:17:20.970
<v Speaker 2>would take my pain pills and then I </v>
<v Speaker 2>would take a laxative because this shit </v>

1798
01:17:20.970 --> 01:17:20.970
<v Speaker 2>makes you constipated.</v>

1799
01:17:20.970 --> 01:17:23.150
<v Speaker 2>So like I was taking a lot of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

1800
01:17:23.151 --> 01:17:28.151
<v Speaker 2>like on a daily basis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing that for four or five </v>

1801
01:17:28.151 --> 01:17:28.151
<v Speaker 2>months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1802
01:17:28.151 --> 01:17:30.420
<v Speaker 2>You're going to get hooked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How'd you get off a?</v>

1803
01:17:30.500 --> 01:17:32.540
<v Speaker 2>My will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that was it.</v>

1804
01:17:32.590 --> 01:17:34.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm weird like that,</v>

1805
01:17:34.551 --> 01:17:38.180
<v Speaker 2>like I don't get addicted to things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like when I go too deep,</v>

1806
01:17:38.181 --> 01:17:39.830
<v Speaker 2>if I feel like something bad's gonna </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen to me,</v>

1807
01:17:39.831 --> 01:17:42.350
<v Speaker 2>like emotionally or I can snap out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1808
01:17:43.220 --> 01:17:45.030
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's self preservation man.</v>

1809
01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:47.390
<v Speaker 2>I got when I used to think about taking </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

1810
01:17:47.391 --> 01:17:50.090
<v Speaker 2>I get that taste like under my tongue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it candy,</v>

1811
01:17:50.091 --> 01:17:52.000
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1812
01:17:52.001 --> 01:17:54.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was brendan schaub said the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same thing.</v>

1813
01:17:55.150 --> 01:17:57.590
<v Speaker 2>A sharp didn't even realize he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>hooked on him.</v>

1814
01:17:57.591 --> 01:18:02.591
<v Speaker 2>He was taking them every day for like </v>
<v Speaker 2>three or four months and then his </v>

1815
01:18:02.591 --> 01:18:04.310
<v Speaker 2>friends apparently intervened and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey dude,</v>

1816
01:18:04.311 --> 01:18:06.320
<v Speaker 2>you're fucking whacked out all day.</v>

1817
01:18:06.660 --> 01:18:08.690
<v Speaker 2>You got to get off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These pills were were the pills?</v>

1818
01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:13.960
<v Speaker 2>They went to his house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cleaned out his bathroom cabinet and </v>

1819
01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:13.960
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>enough,</v>

1870
01:20:30.961 --> 01:20:31.650

<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

1871
01:20:32.210 --> 01:20:35.620
<v Speaker 1>I've had several friends that have had </v>
<v Speaker 1>like serious pill issues.</v>

1872
01:20:35.621 --> 01:20:36.460
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1873
01:20:36.470 --> 01:20:41.470
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's weird how prevalent they are and </v>

1874
01:20:41.470 --> 01:20:41.470
<v Speaker 1>how easy it is to get them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1875
01:20:41.470 --> 01:20:42.620
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had my nose fixed.</v>

1876
01:20:42.621 --> 01:20:44.850
<v Speaker 1>I had a deviated septum so they cleared </v>
<v Speaker 1>it all out,</v>

1877
01:20:44.910 --> 01:20:48.990
<v Speaker 1>cut the turbinates out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stretched open though the openings,</v>

1878
01:20:49.020 --> 01:20:54.020
<v Speaker 1>like put splints in there and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and actually kind of widened the </v>

1879
01:20:54.020 --> 01:20:55.690
<v Speaker 1>physical look of my nose and kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>changed a little bit because it was like</v>

1880
01:20:55.710 --> 01:20:58.020
<v Speaker 1>a little more sucked in like nasal </v>
<v Speaker 1>breathing.</v>

1881
01:20:58.350 --> 01:20:59.100
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Point is,</v>

1882
01:20:59.530 --> 01:21:01.500
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't fucking painful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really mean.</v>

1883
01:21:01.530 --> 01:21:03.750
<v Speaker 1>It was when it was over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was over and I need that.</v>

1884
01:21:04.690 --> 01:21:08.100
<v Speaker 1>I have a deviated septum is one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>best things I've ever done.</v>

1885
01:21:08.310 --> 01:21:13.310
<v Speaker 1>I didn't do it till I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was 39 or something like </v>

1886
01:21:13.310 --> 01:21:13.310
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but once I did it was like,</v>

1887
01:21:13.310 --> 01:21:15.140
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get this big.</v>

1888
01:21:15.540 --> 01:21:17.190
<v Speaker 1>Rafael just had that done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did he?</v>

1889
01:21:17.250 --> 01:21:18.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He because of,</v>

1890
01:21:19.110 --> 01:21:21.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that had been going on </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a long time.</v>

1891
01:21:21.961 --> 01:21:24.320
<v Speaker 1>Like he had it so bad he couldn't even </v>
<v Speaker 1>breathe that junior.</v>

1892
01:21:24.330 --> 01:21:25.660
<v Speaker 1>Joe santos did as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

1893
01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:27.300
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's just fighting,</v>

1894
01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:28.070
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1895
01:21:28.520 --> 01:21:31.230
<v Speaker 1>I had my nose broken for the first time </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was five.</v>

1896
01:21:31.670 --> 01:21:34.770
<v Speaker 1>I fell down a flight of stairs and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was always kind of crooked,</v>

1897
01:21:34.771 --> 01:21:37.100
<v Speaker 1>like the bones kind of weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was inside.</v>

1898
01:21:37.110 --> 01:21:42.110
<v Speaker 1>It was always fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then years of just getting smashed </v>

1899
01:21:42.110 --> 01:21:42.360
<v Speaker 1>in the face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just gets awful.</v>

1900
01:21:42.450 --> 01:21:47.450
<v Speaker 1>It's a point like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you remember vandelay would vandelays </v>

1901
01:21:47.450 --> 01:21:47.450
<v Speaker 1>knows you slipped from flat to his face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1902
01:21:47.450 --> 01:21:49.980
<v Speaker 1>just smushed down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No cartilage at all.</v>

1903
01:21:49.981 --> 01:21:52.520
<v Speaker 1>Everything just mushed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And every bumper door,</v>

1904
01:21:56.810 --> 01:21:58.870
<v Speaker 1>farc the farc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1905
01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:00.210
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1906
01:22:00.211 --> 01:22:05.211
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had his fixed and he went deep the </v>

1907
01:22:05.211 --> 01:22:07.551
<v Speaker 1>other way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got like an extra big nose so he </v>

1908
01:22:07.551 --> 01:22:07.551
<v Speaker 1>could breathe better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they constructed,</v>

1909
01:22:07.551 --> 01:22:09.090
<v Speaker 1>it knows out of his rib.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>

1910
01:22:09.420 --> 01:22:10.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks really.</v>

1911
01:22:11.370 --> 01:22:13.380
<v Speaker 1>How dare you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dare you.</v>

1912
01:22:13.381 --> 01:22:15.150
<v Speaker 1>I see you're being sarcastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1913
01:22:15.180 --> 01:22:17.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean for practical purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to be a fighter,</v>

1914
01:22:17.410 --> 01:22:19.980
<v Speaker 1>really smarter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which shows a lack of vanity.</v>

1915
01:22:20.220 --> 01:22:22.830
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he didn't try to look at all.</v>

1916
01:22:23.010 --> 01:22:25.070
<v Speaker 1>He cut out all the scar tissue in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>neck,</v>

1917
01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:26.330
<v Speaker 1>that eyebrows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1918
01:22:26.430 --> 01:22:27.540
<v Speaker 1>because he was getting that.</v>

1919
01:22:27.780 --> 01:22:30.000
<v Speaker 1>There's another thing that fighters get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that sort of relaxed,</v>

1920
01:22:30.660 --> 01:22:32.380
<v Speaker 1>it impedes vision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

1921
01:22:32.381 --> 01:22:35.940
<v Speaker 1>In some guys have it so bad that you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>see there are lids.</v>

1922
01:22:36.180 --> 01:22:41.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I guess it's from punishment </v>

1923
01:22:41.180 --> 01:22:43.940
<v Speaker 1>from getting hit repetitive scar tissue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scar tissue and also like the relaxation</v>

1924
01:22:44.250 --> 01:22:46.260
<v Speaker 1>of the muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That new nurse probably.</v>

1925
01:22:46.261 --> 01:22:49.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it starts to fall over the eye and it</v>

1926
01:22:49.381 --> 01:22:51.570
<v Speaker 1>actually gets in the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's vandelay,</v>

1927
01:22:51.720 --> 01:22:53.880
<v Speaker 1>but that's vandelay before he got fucked</v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

1928
01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:55.890
<v Speaker 1>That's vandelay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when he was young.</v>

1929
01:22:55.891 --> 01:22:59.070
<v Speaker 1>Probably like 2003.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's uh,</v>

1930
01:22:59.100 --> 01:23:04.100
<v Speaker 1>that's the early days of annually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's vandelay when he was the pride </v>

1931
01:23:04.100 --> 01:23:05.610
<v Speaker 1>channel and labeled knows number one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1932
01:23:05.750 --> 01:23:09.220
<v Speaker 1>you got to see vandelay in like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what he looks like now.</v>

1933
01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:13.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean his eyes are different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not what it looked like right</v>

1934
01:23:13.391 --> 01:23:18.391
<v Speaker 1>after the surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's his face with cat woman </v>

1935
01:23:18.391 --> 01:23:18.500
<v Speaker 1>after the surgery.</v>

1936
01:23:18.500 --> 01:23:21.280
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He came onto the scales,</v>

1937
01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:22.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the,</v>

1938
01:23:22.271 --> 01:23:24.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the ufc and he was cornering.</v>

1939
01:23:24.881 --> 01:23:28.270
<v Speaker 1>Somebody stepped up to the cage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's him.</v>

1940
01:23:28.300 --> 01:23:30.190
<v Speaker 1>You see where the pink tape on his </v>
<v Speaker 1>gloves.</v>

1941
01:23:30.370 --> 01:23:32.560
<v Speaker 1>That's him and his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his best.</v>

1942
01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:35.500
<v Speaker 1>That's before his nose was fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when,</v>

1943
01:23:35.680 --> 01:23:38.530
<v Speaker 1>that's probably him in 2001 or something</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

1944
01:23:38.890 --> 01:23:41.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean that was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was vandelay in his prime.</v>

1945
01:23:41.891 --> 01:23:46.891
<v Speaker 1>I want to say that looks like it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>right before rampage jackson or </v>

1946
01:23:46.891 --> 01:23:46.891
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two thousand one,</v>

1947
01:23:46.891 --> 01:23:47.980
<v Speaker 1>2002.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His nose was fine.</v>

1948
01:23:48.130 --> 01:23:50.230
<v Speaker 1>And then if you see like vandelay versus</v>
<v Speaker 1>chocolate dell,</v>

1949
01:23:50.231 --> 01:23:52.990
<v Speaker 1>I have a poster on my wall in my gym at </v>
<v Speaker 1>home,</v>

1950
01:23:53.290 --> 01:23:58.290
<v Speaker 1>have a vandelay versus chocolate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dell and vandelays knows is just </v>

1951
01:23:58.290 --> 01:24:00.640
<v Speaker 1>smashed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like flattened to his face.</v>

1952
01:24:01.230 --> 01:24:06.230
<v Speaker 1>And that was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that one where his arms are up in </v>

1953
01:24:06.230 --> 01:24:06.230
<v Speaker 1>the air.</v>

1954
01:24:06.230 --> 01:24:06.230
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see that picture up there,</v>

1955
01:24:06.230 --> 01:24:08.380
<v Speaker 1>like click on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go go large on that.</v>

1956
01:24:09.070 --> 01:24:11.330
<v Speaker 1>You could see in that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's,</v>

1957
01:24:11.340 --> 01:24:16.340
<v Speaker 1>that's it seems like after the </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] fight that it's tough to </v>

1958
01:24:16.340 --> 01:24:16.340
<v Speaker 1>tell there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for a lot of tHe fights,</v>

1959
01:24:16.340 --> 01:24:18.640
<v Speaker 1>like his nose was just useless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He couldn't breathe out of it.</v>

1960
01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:23.760
<v Speaker 1>So he went the other way and he got this</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking crazy nose job where they gave </v>

1961
01:24:23.831 --> 01:24:25.660
<v Speaker 1>them a bigger nose so he could breathe </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of it.</v>

1962
01:24:25.661 --> 01:24:27.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you see like knows number three,</v>

1963
01:24:28.250 --> 01:24:30.070
<v Speaker 1>like that image right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1964
01:24:30.330 --> 01:24:31.580
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look how much bigger is this?</v>

1965
01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:37.200
<v Speaker 1>But that's smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like he did that so he could </v>

1966
01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:37.200
<v Speaker 1>breathe out of it better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot bigger,</v>

1967
01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:41.410
<v Speaker 1>like the bone or the cartilage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could see it like goes lower.</v>

1968
01:24:41.860 --> 01:24:46.860
<v Speaker 1>Like when you're talking to them it went</v>
<v Speaker 1>lower to like sort of like he has a big </v>

1969
01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:49.900
<v Speaker 1>accentuated cartlidge there.</v>

1970
01:24:50.940 --> 01:24:53.110
<v Speaker 1>That guy has taken some fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>punishment.</v>

1971
01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:55.900
<v Speaker 1>You want to talk about a warrior for </v>
<v Speaker 1>christ.</v>

1972
01:24:56.590 --> 01:25:01.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean that guy has been in fucking wars</v>
<v Speaker 1>like down there.</v>

1973
01:25:01.420 --> 01:25:06.420
<v Speaker 1>You see all those images.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that one where he's got the </v>

1974
01:25:06.420 --> 01:25:06.420
<v Speaker 1>white tank top right there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the right of that,</v>

1975
01:25:06.420 --> 01:25:06.420
<v Speaker 1>right below.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That it right there.</v>

1976
01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:09.730
<v Speaker 1>That's where you could see a tough now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not even at his worst.</v>

1977
01:25:10.430 --> 01:25:12.910
<v Speaker 1>It's not even at its worst.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At its worst was right before we got the</v>

1978
01:25:12.911 --> 01:25:17.911
<v Speaker 1>operation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was just completely that </v>

1979
01:25:17.911 --> 01:25:20.221
<v Speaker 1>after the operation right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that might be photoshop him.</v>

1980
01:25:21.190 --> 01:25:26.190
<v Speaker 1>He was jimmy duranti for halloween,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's a dated right there.</v>

1981
01:25:26.351 --> 01:25:28.450
<v Speaker 1>Right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That black one in the black shirt.</v>

1982
01:25:28.510 --> 01:25:29.920
<v Speaker 1>Oh man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1983
01:25:29.940 --> 01:25:32.560
<v Speaker 1>His nose pretty smashed there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that might be after a fight.</v>

1984
01:25:33.690 --> 01:25:36.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's not even at the worst.</v>

1985
01:25:36.491 --> 01:25:41.491
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy has taken some fucking insane </v>

1986
01:25:41.491 --> 01:25:43.450
<v Speaker 1>damage in his career and we've watched </v>
<v Speaker 1>his face alter because of that damage.</v>

1987
01:25:43.670 --> 01:25:48.400
<v Speaker 1>Out of all the fighters in the ufc and </v>
<v Speaker 1>in pride and in mma in general.</v>

1988
01:25:48.401 --> 01:25:51.160
<v Speaker 1>His face as altered the most because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>punishment.</v>

1989
01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:54.480
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] probably second close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1990
01:25:54.750 --> 01:25:58.150
<v Speaker 1>but mandalay's more than anybody because</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the one that got it fixed.</v>

1991
01:25:58.180 --> 01:26:03.180
<v Speaker 1>He's the only.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only one of those guys that got it </v>

1992
01:26:03.180 --> 01:26:05.131
<v Speaker 1>fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nick diaz had some stuff done to his </v>

1993
01:26:05.131 --> 01:26:05.131
<v Speaker 1>eyebrows</v>

1994
01:26:05.131 --> 01:26:06.040
<v Speaker 2>till you said he had so much scar tissue</v>
<v Speaker 2>that had.</v>

1995
01:26:06.170 --> 01:26:10.060
<v Speaker 2>He actually had his bone shaved down to </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's the edges of his bones.</v>

1996
01:26:10.920 --> 01:26:12.860
<v Speaker 2>I'll cut you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A couple of guys.</v>

1997
01:26:12.861 --> 01:26:15.890
<v Speaker 2>I trained in the Philippines like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're pretty susceptible to cut.</v>

1998
01:26:15.940 --> 01:26:17.330
<v Speaker 2>You want to see some boxers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1999
01:26:18.380 --> 01:26:20.600
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you see the genetic,</v>

2000
01:26:20.601 --> 01:26:22.950
<v Speaker 2>lufkin and chocolate?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>They got me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

2004
01:26:26.541 --> 01:26:27.470
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to go see chocolate.</v>

2005
01:26:27.471 --> 01:26:29.960
<v Speaker 2>Tito.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tito is a bad dude.</v>

2006
01:26:30.020 --> 01:26:33.410
<v Speaker 2>He is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of my guys fought him in Japan about</v>

2007
01:26:33.860 --> 01:26:37.160
<v Speaker 2>maybe six months ago and I did a hell of</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot better than the other guy.</v>

2008
01:26:37.980 --> 01:26:39.070
<v Speaker 2>Kind of stopped short.</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

2009
01:26:39.140 --> 01:26:41.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we would want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We probably wouldn't have won that fight</v>

2010
01:26:41.901 --> 01:26:42.650
<v Speaker 2>either way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2011
01:26:42.700 --> 01:26:44.000
<v Speaker 2>chocolate tito's amazing.</v>

2012
01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:47.480
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these lighter weight division is 1:12</v>

2013
01:26:47.481 --> 01:26:52.481
<v Speaker 2>division and the [inaudible] eight </v>
<v Speaker 2>division right now are like exciting </v>

2014
01:26:52.481 --> 01:26:55.601
<v Speaker 2>divisions and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just stoked that they got some </v>

2015
01:26:55.601 --> 01:26:56.890
<v Speaker 2>coverage in the us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like on hbo shows.</v>

2016
01:26:56.891 --> 01:26:59.090
<v Speaker 2>Like I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really a stacked.</v>

2017
01:26:59.091 --> 01:27:00.890
<v Speaker 2>If you really look into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>THe lighter weight man,</v>

2018
01:27:00.891 --> 01:27:02.740
<v Speaker 2>it's really stacked and there's a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>action,</v>

2019
01:27:02.900 --> 01:27:06.010
<v Speaker 2>a lot of knockouts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as long as they have short referees,</v>

2020
01:27:07.070 --> 01:27:11.400
<v Speaker 2>like a jockey that'd be sick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't like.</v>

2021
01:27:11.480 --> 01:27:14.300
<v Speaker 2>If you have a 108 pound fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to have a little tiny reference.</v>

2022
01:27:14.301 --> 01:27:15.110
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2023
01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:17.300
<v Speaker 2>and maybe slower the ropes a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

2024
01:27:17.301 --> 01:27:20.120
<v Speaker 2>Like you did a good move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really thought about that.</v>

2025
01:27:20.121 --> 01:27:25.121
<v Speaker 2>The last fight you see better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I got a guy who I trained in the </v>

2026
01:27:25.121 --> 01:27:26.510
<v Speaker 2>Philippines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>daunting yet says noni,</v>

2027
01:27:26.870 --> 01:27:31.870
<v Speaker 2>and yet he's the longest reigning </v>
<v Speaker 2>filipino champion of all time and this </v>

2028
01:27:31.870 --> 01:27:33.110
<v Speaker 2>guy is such an exciting fighter.</v>

2029
01:27:33.110 --> 01:27:34.680
<v Speaker 2>He moved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his nickname is aha.</v>

2030
01:27:34.740 --> 01:27:37.670
<v Speaker 2>Switch in the gulag means snake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

2031
01:27:37.850 --> 01:27:40.850
<v Speaker 2>So he moves like a snake in the ring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like his head movement.</v>

2032
01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:43.670
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his speed and timing are just on another</v>

2033
01:27:43.671 --> 01:27:48.671
<v Speaker 2>level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's got one punch knockout power </v>

2034
01:27:48.671 --> 01:27:48.671
<v Speaker 2>for 100,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight pound fighter.</v>

2035
01:27:48.671 --> 01:27:50.410
<v Speaker 2>It's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The power of this sky generates whatever</v>

2036
01:27:50.420 --> 01:27:51.710
<v Speaker 2>happened in novato,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dinair.</v>

2037
01:27:51.770 --> 01:27:56.770
<v Speaker 2>He's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually gonna be seeing him in a </v>

2038
01:27:56.770 --> 01:27:56.770
<v Speaker 2>few weeks in the Philippines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a,</v>

2039
01:27:56.770 --> 01:28:01.720
<v Speaker 2>I worked with him for one flight and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually ended up having to leave like </v>

2040
01:28:01.720 --> 01:28:01.970
<v Speaker 2>maybe like three or four weeks before </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fight,</v>

2041
01:28:02.630 --> 01:28:03.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some things,</v>

2042
01:28:03.501 --> 01:28:04.780
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

2043
01:28:05.440 --> 01:28:07.330
<v Speaker 2>he kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think my personal opinion,</v>

2044
01:28:07.340 --> 01:28:09.790
<v Speaker 2>I liked the guy as a person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a fucking great guy.</v>

2045
01:28:09.791 --> 01:28:11.720
<v Speaker 2>Did like a really cool person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seems very cool.</v>

2046
01:28:11.750 --> 01:28:14.540
<v Speaker 2>He really is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think what he got that fighter the</v>

2047
01:28:14.541 --> 01:28:17.360
<v Speaker 2>year thing I maybe went to head a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>bit and then,</v>

2048
01:28:17.361 --> 01:28:18.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you're probably hearing this.</v>

2049
01:28:18.630 --> 01:28:21.560
<v Speaker 2>Oh sorry did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think it went to his head a little</v>

2050
01:28:21.561 --> 01:28:26.561
<v Speaker 2>bit and maybe the ego got in the way and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he kind of stopped listening to the </v>

2051
01:28:26.561 --> 01:28:28.100
<v Speaker 2>coaches and it was evident in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>walters fight,</v>

2052
01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:29.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he even said like,</v>

2053
01:28:29.301 --> 01:28:34.301
<v Speaker 2>I stopped listening to my dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should have been listening to my dad </v>

2054
01:28:34.301 --> 01:28:34.301
<v Speaker 2>on the corner and look what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2055
01:28:34.301 --> 01:28:37.100
<v Speaker 2>and I said this in the training camp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people in his entourage.</v>

2056
01:28:37.101 --> 01:28:37.730
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

2057
01:28:38.210 --> 01:28:39.740
<v Speaker 2>He's not listening to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not,</v>

2058
01:28:39.830 --> 01:28:42.290
<v Speaker 2>he's coaching his dad like had to train </v>
<v Speaker 2>him like,</v>

2059
01:28:42.900 --> 01:28:46.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy could potentially be one of the</v>

2060
01:28:46.011 --> 01:28:51.011
<v Speaker 2>best boxers we've ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he just listened and I was at this </v>

2061
01:28:51.011 --> 01:28:51.011
<v Speaker 2>rate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something's going to happen.</v>

2062
01:28:51.011 --> 01:28:52.250
<v Speaker 2>He's going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to get knocked out or he's</v>

2063
01:28:52.251 --> 01:28:57.251
<v Speaker 2>going to get hurt and then everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to snap it and they're going to </v>

2064
01:28:57.251 --> 01:28:57.251
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2065
01:28:57.251 --> 01:28:57.620
<v Speaker 2>we should have fucking done this or we </v>
<v Speaker 2>should've done that.</v>

2066
01:28:58.460 --> 01:29:00.020
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now he's doing it.</v>

2067
01:29:00.050 --> 01:29:02.130
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's back and he's dedicated</v>

2068
01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:04.140
<v Speaker 1>to late.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How old is he now?</v>

2069
01:29:04.141 --> 01:29:05.670
<v Speaker 1>He's 30.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's 31,</v>

2070
01:29:05.700 --> 01:29:08.970
<v Speaker 1>but I have a really lightweight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's fighting a 1:22</v>

2071
01:29:08.971 --> 01:29:09.770
<v Speaker 1>I think now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2072
01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:12.110
<v Speaker 1>Is that right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so killed.</v>

2073
01:29:12.450 --> 01:29:15.060
<v Speaker 1>Did he like the guys in his division?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'll destroy them.</v>

2074
01:29:15.220 --> 01:29:16.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he started to.</v>

2075
01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:21.400
<v Speaker 1>It just seems like that at that age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the lower weight classes,</v>

2076
01:29:21.930 --> 01:29:25.870
<v Speaker 1>age is like if he was 32 years old and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he was fighting and heavyweight,</v>

2077
01:29:25.890 --> 01:29:26.320
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2078
01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:28.080
<v Speaker 1>he's going to keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2079
01:29:28.081 --> 01:29:31.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like heavyweights mature later.</v>

2080
01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:32.850
<v Speaker 1>Do you agree with that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2081
01:29:32.860 --> 01:29:33.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know to be honest.</v>

2082
01:29:33.990 --> 01:29:36.340
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I was wondering about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually.</v>

2083
01:29:36.341 --> 01:29:37.830
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I wanted to ask you </v>
<v Speaker 1>about is it,</v>

2084
01:29:37.890 --> 01:29:42.030
<v Speaker 1>is it because like a guy like vladimir </v>
<v Speaker 1>klitschko,</v>

2085
01:29:42.031 --> 01:29:45.150
<v Speaker 1>so just this massive person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always wondered like,</v>

2086
01:29:45.151 --> 01:29:50.151
<v Speaker 1>does it take longer to develop </v>
<v Speaker 1>efficiency of movement and the ability </v>

2087
01:29:50.761 --> 01:29:53.400
<v Speaker 1>to move your body better to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding your body if you have more</v>

2088
01:29:53.430 --> 01:29:54.600
<v Speaker 1>of it to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to learn.</v>

2089
01:29:55.620 --> 01:29:58.500
<v Speaker 1>If you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say if you're dealing with a much larger</v>

2090
01:29:58.501 --> 01:30:00.420
<v Speaker 1>frame,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much more body mass.</v>

2091
01:30:00.450 --> 01:30:03.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So is it more gravity?</v>

2092
01:30:03.031 --> 01:30:08.031
<v Speaker 1>You're dealing with more gravity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with the influence of </v>

2093
01:30:08.031 --> 01:30:08.031
<v Speaker 1>that gravity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It slows you down.</v>

2094
01:30:08.031 --> 01:30:08.910
<v Speaker 1>You're obviously slower in a lighter way</v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

2095
01:30:08.911 --> 01:30:12.570
<v Speaker 1>Is it more difficult to develop mastery </v>
<v Speaker 1>of skill?</v>

2096
01:30:14.140 --> 01:30:16.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a good question,</v>

2097
01:30:16.391 --> 01:30:17.860
<v Speaker 2>joel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there is some,</v>

2098
01:30:17.890 --> 01:30:21.250
<v Speaker 2>maybe some truth to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the length of the limb requires the</v>

2099
01:30:21.251 --> 01:30:24.490
<v Speaker 2>leverage that you get on the muscles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be a lot greater.</v>

2100
01:30:24.500 --> 01:30:29.500
<v Speaker 2>Like the torque you need to generate out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the smaller muscles to control the </v>

2101
01:30:29.500 --> 01:30:29.830
<v Speaker 2>larger lamb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

2102
01:30:29.831 --> 01:30:34.831
<v Speaker 2>that's gonna play a big role,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the length of the limb can determine </v>

2103
01:30:34.831 --> 01:30:36.460
<v Speaker 2>how much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much force you can produce also,</v>

2104
01:30:36.550 --> 01:30:39.670
<v Speaker 2>so it'll play a role on the mechanics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think uh,</v>

2105
01:30:39.730 --> 01:30:40.700
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think uh,</v>

2106
01:30:41.110 --> 01:30:44.710
<v Speaker 2>I think it is maybe a little bit harder </v>
<v Speaker 2>for some of those big guys just strictly</v>

2107
01:30:44.711 --> 01:30:45.580
<v Speaker 2>like on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the,</v>

2108
01:30:46.570 --> 01:30:49.360
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's the relative strength,</v>

2109
01:30:49.930 --> 01:30:50.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2110
01:30:50.621 --> 01:30:51.970
<v Speaker 2>I really can't answer that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2111
01:30:51.990 --> 01:30:55.830
<v Speaker 1>I always felt like they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're dealing with more gravity.</v>

2112
01:30:56.070 --> 01:30:58.770
<v Speaker 1>Like it seemed to me that like lighter </v>
<v Speaker 1>weight guys,</v>

2113
01:30:59.070 --> 01:31:04.070
<v Speaker 1>especially back in the kickboxing days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had noticed that the lighter weight </v>

2114
01:31:04.070 --> 01:31:06.690
<v Speaker 1>guys seem to learn quicker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They seem to pick up the skills quicker.</v>

2115
01:31:06.740 --> 01:31:08.610
<v Speaker 1>There are obviously always faster</v>

2116
01:31:09.040 --> 01:31:14.040
<v Speaker 2>be a higher degree of relative strength </v>
<v Speaker 2>to like your strength to bodyweight </v>

2117
01:31:14.040 --> 01:31:14.680
<v Speaker 2>ratio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2118
01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:14.840
<v Speaker 2>or</v>

2119
01:31:15.670 --> 01:31:20.670
<v Speaker 1>could have something to do with it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the other thing is you never see</v>

2120
01:31:20.830 --> 01:31:23.650
<v Speaker 1>a guy at heavyweight that can move like </v>
<v Speaker 1>mighty mouse,</v>

2121
01:31:23.710 --> 01:31:25.570
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they just don't exist now.</v>

2122
01:31:25.870 --> 01:31:26.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at,</v>

2123
01:31:26.860 --> 01:31:29.170
<v Speaker 1>if you watch mighty mouse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>demetrius johnson,</v>

2124
01:31:29.200 --> 01:31:32.710
<v Speaker 1>the ufc flyweight champion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy who my opinion is best pound for</v>

2125
01:31:32.711 --> 01:31:37.711
<v Speaker 1>pound fighter in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think when it comes to taking the </v>

2126
01:31:37.711 --> 01:31:41.641
<v Speaker 1>least amount of punishment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ability to make great fighters look </v>

2127
01:31:41.641 --> 01:31:44.821
<v Speaker 1>average,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ability to impose his skillset and </v>

2128
01:31:44.821 --> 01:31:48.210
<v Speaker 1>never runs out of gas and is always </v>
<v Speaker 1>technically he's always in the best </v>

2129
01:31:48.210 --> 01:31:48.970
<v Speaker 1>position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's always doing the right thing.</v>

2130
01:31:48.971 --> 01:31:50.650
<v Speaker 1>Like he's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really well trained.</v>

2131
01:31:51.010 --> 01:31:56.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen a fucking heavyweight </v>

2132
01:31:56.010 --> 01:31:58.260
<v Speaker 1>even remotely move like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the best heavyweight in the world </v>

2133
01:31:58.260 --> 01:31:59.740
<v Speaker 1>is cain velasquez obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's to beat purdue.</v>

2134
01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:00.040
<v Speaker 1>It's</v>

2135
01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:05.040
<v Speaker 3>tough fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very tough fIght because his big </v>

2136
01:32:05.040 --> 01:32:05.570
<v Speaker 3>strength is taking guys down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2137
01:32:05.690 --> 01:32:07.660
<v Speaker 3>take down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're in a world of shit.</v>

2138
01:32:07.750 --> 01:32:10.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That guy is no joke off his back.</v>

2139
01:32:10.570 --> 01:32:15.570
<v Speaker 3>His fucking guard is head and shoulders </v>
<v Speaker 3>above anybody that cane has ever faced </v>

2140
01:32:15.570 --> 01:32:16.480
<v Speaker 3>without a doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

2141
01:32:16.510 --> 01:32:18.400
<v Speaker 3>I don't know who he brought in to train </v>
<v Speaker 3>with it,</v>

2142
01:32:18.520 --> 01:32:19.930
<v Speaker 3>but they're not good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2143
01:32:19.990 --> 01:32:21.940
<v Speaker 3>Who the fuck are you going to bring it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unless you bring it in,</v>

2144
01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:24.030
<v Speaker 3>you'd have to bring in a vinny </v>
<v Speaker 3>magallanes,</v>

2145
01:32:24.280 --> 01:32:29.280
<v Speaker 3>someone who is a go really and only </v>
<v Speaker 3>specifically work the ground aspect of </v>

2146
01:32:29.280 --> 01:32:32.110
<v Speaker 3>it because vinny can't hang with volume </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the feet.</v>

2147
01:32:32.130 --> 01:32:33.990
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>BecAuse hafez,</v>

2148
01:32:33.991 --> 01:32:38.991

<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2163
01:33:16.251 --> 01:33:17.860
<v Speaker 3>he kicked his ass standing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that was crazy.</v>

2164
01:33:18.050 --> 01:33:21.290
<v Speaker 3>Watch him double jab travis brown,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2165
01:33:21.670 --> 01:33:26.670
<v Speaker 3>being that was crazy to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you go back to his fight with </v>

2166
01:33:26.670 --> 01:33:30.930
<v Speaker 3>junior dos santos or even before that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his fights and pride and you see the </v>

2167
01:33:30.930 --> 01:33:33.430
<v Speaker 3>rudimentary striking he had back then </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you look at his abilities now.</v>

2168
01:33:33.700 --> 01:33:34.860
<v Speaker 3>Pretty god damn impressive.</v>

2169
01:33:34.980 --> 01:33:38.550
<v Speaker 2>Cornell has a great striking coach and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>humble guy too.</v>

2170
01:33:38.551 --> 01:33:39.900
<v Speaker 2>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really nice.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You look at the best fighters in the </v>

2173
01:33:46.970 --> 01:33:46.970
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the two best guys,</v>

2174
01:33:46.970 --> 01:33:49.260
<v Speaker 3>the two best guys in the heavyweight </v>
<v Speaker 3>division currently the best of all time.</v>

2175
01:33:50.170 --> 01:33:53.360
<v Speaker 3>I kinda gotta go with fader.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think fade or.</v>

2176
01:33:53.430 --> 01:33:55.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's the best of all time in the</v>

2177
01:33:55.441 --> 01:33:57.080
<v Speaker 3>heavyweight division.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't,</v>

2178
01:33:57.180 --> 01:34:02.180
<v Speaker 3>I mean maybe became with a beat him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would've loved to seen them about the </v>

2179
01:34:02.180 --> 01:34:02.180
<v Speaker 3>natural.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2180
01:34:02.180 --> 01:34:05.790
<v Speaker 3>randy is really a light heavyweight and </v>
<v Speaker 3>heavyweight.</v>

2181
01:34:05.850 --> 01:34:08.160
<v Speaker 3>He was undersized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he was a great,</v>

2182
01:34:08.161 --> 01:34:11.160
<v Speaker 3>great fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think honestly,</v>

2183
01:34:11.190 --> 01:34:13.320
<v Speaker 3>pound for pound,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't.</v>

2184
01:34:13.580 --> 01:34:15.970
<v Speaker 3>I mean fado easily could have been two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2185
01:34:15.971 --> 01:34:16.890
<v Speaker 3>five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two by the way.</v>

2186
01:34:17.330 --> 01:34:18.150
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he waSn't a,</v>

2187
01:34:18.270 --> 01:34:23.270
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't a like when you see a guy like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's carrying around all that extra </v>

2188
01:34:23.270 --> 01:34:23.270
<v Speaker 3>fat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you think about that?</v>

2189
01:34:23.270 --> 01:34:24.180
<v Speaker 3>Like cain carrIes around extra.</v>

2190
01:34:24.540 --> 01:34:25.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2191
01:34:26.730 --> 01:34:27.920
<v Speaker 2>I think as long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2192
01:34:28.410 --> 01:34:28.980
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2193
01:34:28.981 --> 01:34:31.620
<v Speaker 2>that's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't matter,</v>

2194
01:34:32.100 --> 01:34:34.420
<v Speaker 2>obviously not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it does it mean,</v>

2195
01:34:34.510 --> 01:34:35.850
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's obviously a monster,</v>

2196
01:34:36.240 --> 01:34:39.830
<v Speaker 2>but would it be better if he had very </v>
<v Speaker 2>little muslin?</v>

2197
01:34:40.770 --> 01:34:41.820
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not necessarily.</v>

2198
01:34:41.821 --> 01:34:46.821
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that goes back to what we're </v>

2199
01:34:46.821 --> 01:34:46.821
<v Speaker 2>saying about the rate of force </v>
<v Speaker 2>development and how,</v>

2200
01:34:46.821 --> 01:34:51.270
<v Speaker 2>if you look how explosive fader is </v>
<v Speaker 2>despite not being looking like hercules.</v>

2201
01:34:51.540 --> 01:34:52.160
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2202
01:34:52.200 --> 01:34:53.730
<v Speaker 2>That goes back to what we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

2203
01:34:53.731 --> 01:34:55.950
<v Speaker 2>the rate of forced development and how </v>
<v Speaker 2>the nervous system,</v>

2204
01:34:56.400 --> 01:35:01.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>plays the greatest role In how much </v>

2205
01:35:01.400 --> 01:35:02.300
<v Speaker 2>force you produce,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so how explosive you are.</v>

2206
01:35:02.510 --> 01:35:07.510
<v Speaker 2>He's an interesting case too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that he started off his career early </v>

2207
01:35:07.510 --> 01:35:08.240
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was into heavy kettle bells,</v>

2208
01:35:08.241 --> 01:35:10.220
<v Speaker 2>did a lot of lifting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was a thicker,</v>

2209
01:35:10.280 --> 01:35:13.010
<v Speaker 2>bigger guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then as time went on,</v>

2210
01:35:13.160 --> 01:35:18.160
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he talked about how he didn't lift </v>

2211
01:35:18.160 --> 01:35:18.160
<v Speaker 2>weights anymore and he just relied on </v>
<v Speaker 2>skill training.</v>

2212
01:35:18.460 --> 01:35:23.460
<v Speaker 2>He just would wrestle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And sambo and kickboxing and all that </v>

2213
01:35:23.460 --> 01:35:24.270
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember you asking.</v>

2214
01:35:24.290 --> 01:35:26.990
<v Speaker 2>I think I heard a show you're asking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2215
01:35:26.991 --> 01:35:28.550
<v Speaker 2>you're wondering what the russian guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>are doing.</v>

2216
01:35:28.551 --> 01:35:29.840
<v Speaker 2>Like these wrestling guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2217
01:35:29.841 --> 01:35:31.250
<v Speaker 2>what are they doing for their </v>
<v Speaker 2>conditioning?</v>

2218
01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:34.850
<v Speaker 2>The truth is not much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not doing weights.</v>

2219
01:35:34.870 --> 01:35:36.290
<v Speaker 2>a lot of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just wrestling.</v>

2220
01:35:36.740 --> 01:35:38.500
<v Speaker 2>I know this because a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you know,</v>

2221
01:35:38.530 --> 01:35:40.530
<v Speaker 2>I train aaron peko.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you familiar with their agenda?</v>

2222
01:35:40.550 --> 01:35:42.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's one of my guys too.</v>

2223
01:35:42.550 --> 01:35:47.550
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I trained him and he goes out there </v>

2224
01:35:47.550 --> 01:35:49.511
<v Speaker 2>for months at a time and changes with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the russians and the ukrainian national </v>

2225
01:35:49.511 --> 01:35:49.511
<v Speaker 2>teams and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2226
01:35:49.511 --> 01:35:49.970
<v Speaker 2>they're just wrestle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

2227
01:35:50.030 --> 01:35:51.410
<v Speaker 2>No strength and conditioning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not really.</v>

2228
01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:53.350
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think?</v>

2229
01:35:53.351 --> 01:35:54.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna do some running and stuff like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2230
01:35:55.190 --> 01:35:57.770
<v Speaker 2>I think uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well they've got great wrestlers.</v>

2231
01:35:58.040 --> 01:36:01.070
<v Speaker 2>So I would almost rather have that than </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a detrimental thing.</v>

2232
01:36:01.071 --> 01:36:03.500
<v Speaker 2>And they're like heavy weight lifting or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

2233
01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:04.720
<v Speaker 2>So you'd have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2234
01:36:04.820 --> 01:36:09.820
<v Speaker 2>I would rather have them just focusing </v>
<v Speaker 2>all their energy on their skill and </v>

2235
01:36:09.820 --> 01:36:14.111
<v Speaker 2>doing some cardiovascular training.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever seen the workouts that </v>

2236
01:36:14.111 --> 01:36:15.950
<v Speaker 2>cain velasquez don't know how you want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to throw up?</v>

2237
01:36:16.490 --> 01:36:17.440
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2238
01:36:17.630 --> 01:36:19.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean a good way to say it out.</v>

2239
01:36:19.920 --> 01:36:24.920
<v Speaker 2>Cain velasquez has some weight lifting </v>
<v Speaker 2>routines that he has some guy working </v>

2240
01:36:24.920 --> 01:36:25.820
<v Speaker 2>out with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I showed it to steve maxwell.</v>

2241
01:36:25.821 --> 01:36:27.470
<v Speaker 2>Steve maxwell got angry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

2242
01:36:27.500 --> 01:36:28.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's check it out.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2244
01:36:29.511 --> 01:36:34.040
<v Speaker 2>Show show I'm kettle bell swings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's doing like really heavy kettle bell</v>

2245
01:36:34.041 --> 01:36:35.870
<v Speaker 2>swings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not lying.</v>

2246
01:36:35.900 --> 01:36:38.150
<v Speaker 2>Maxwell got angry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You really get angry.</v>

2247
01:36:38.180 --> 01:36:40.100
<v Speaker 2>Steve maxwell the kettlebell and master,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rIght?</v>

2248
01:36:40.101 --> 01:36:43.400
<v Speaker 2>Like I been do it for a long time now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's not just kettlebell master.</v>

2249
01:36:43.401 --> 01:36:48.390
<v Speaker 2>He says like an overall fitness guru.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He understands the human body.</v>

2250
01:36:48.420 --> 01:36:51.770
<v Speaker 2>He's like a real student of all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 2>different modalities.</v>

2251
01:36:51.771 --> 01:36:53.420
<v Speaker 2>Like watch this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>watch this.</v>

2252
01:36:53.870 --> 01:36:56.980
<v Speaker 2>He's got this giant kettle bell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at this.</v>

2253
01:36:59.030 --> 01:36:59.830
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kinda.</v>

2254
01:36:59.870 --> 01:37:03.400
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like he's doing like tend is</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at.</v>

2255
01:37:03.450 --> 01:37:07.070
<v Speaker 2>It's not really a swing because he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of pulling it up more like a,</v>

2256
01:37:07.140 --> 01:37:08.960
<v Speaker 2>like almost like a dead lift.</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2257
01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:11.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's got got to make them </v>
<v Speaker 2>stronger,</v>

2258
01:37:11.481 --> 01:37:16.340
<v Speaker 2>but the lower back thing he's doing is </v>
<v Speaker 2>not swing like he's popping it up.</v>

2259
01:37:16.370 --> 01:37:20.600
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas every other kettle bell swing,</v>

2260
01:37:20.630 --> 01:37:22.120
<v Speaker 2>you'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just fell off.</v>

2261
01:37:22.140 --> 01:37:27.140
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea how it's gonna help in </v>

2262
01:37:27.140 --> 01:37:27.140
<v Speaker 2>the new ufc,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ms.to</v>

2263
01:37:27.140 --> 01:37:27.950
<v Speaker 2>make them stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess it's wrong or it's going to make</v>

2264
01:37:27.951 --> 01:37:32.951
<v Speaker 2>them stronger at doing kettlebell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet about it lay some pipe like a </v>

2265
01:37:32.951 --> 01:37:36.011
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see if he can find a correct technique.</v>

2266
01:37:39.290 --> 01:37:44.290
<v Speaker 2>Double-handed kettlebell swing online,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like maybe maxwell has a video or </v>

2267
01:37:44.290 --> 01:37:46.350
<v Speaker 2>someone or mike mauler is very good at </v>
<v Speaker 2>that and he.</v>

2268
01:37:46.430 --> 01:37:51.430
<v Speaker 2>He's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a great instructor as far as like </v>

2269
01:37:51.430 --> 01:37:56.350
<v Speaker 2>proper fundamentals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a bunch of those that he </v>

2270
01:37:56.350 --> 01:37:56.350
<v Speaker 2>has.</v>

2271
01:37:56.350 --> 01:37:59.830
<v Speaker 2>Like one of them is leg extensions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll show you the cain velasquez leg </v>

2272
01:37:59.830 --> 01:38:02.481
<v Speaker 2>extension one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll throw up at that one too because </v>

2273
01:38:02.481 --> 01:38:05.181
<v Speaker 2>he's doing like 300 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Leg extensions needs to happen.</v>

2274
01:38:07.620 --> 01:38:10.050
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both shoulders blown out,</v>

2275
01:38:10.260 --> 01:38:12.150
<v Speaker 2>shoulders repaired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See this guy,</v>

2276
01:38:12.151 --> 01:38:17.151
<v Speaker 2>this guy's using three pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's might not be the best guy to look </v>

2277
01:38:17.151 --> 01:38:17.730
<v Speaker 2>at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is how it's supposed to look.</v>

2278
01:38:18.610 --> 01:38:23.610
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's popping his hips forward and the </v>

2279
01:38:23.610 --> 01:38:26.300
<v Speaker 2>arm swings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's called the kettlebell </v>

2280
01:38:26.300 --> 01:38:26.300
<v Speaker 2>swing phase two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 10,</v>

2281
01:38:26.300 --> 01:38:28.440
<v Speaker 2>15 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were early adopter.</v>

2282
01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:29.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love them.</v>

2283
01:38:30.330 --> 01:38:32.260
<v Speaker 2>My favorite thing to work out with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I like,</v>

2284
01:38:32.300 --> 01:38:33.730
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for an athlete I wouldn't have them do.</v>

2285
01:38:33.750 --> 01:38:34.650
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be honest.</v>

2286
01:38:34.830 --> 01:38:39.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But for guys like you and me as we're </v>

2287
01:38:39.830 --> 01:38:42.591
<v Speaker 2>getting older and I'm going to be 42,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I need to keep the muscle along a </v>

2288
01:38:42.591 --> 01:38:42.591
<v Speaker 2>little bit.</v>

2289
01:38:42.591 --> 01:38:43.350
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for general fitness,</v>

2290
01:38:43.351 --> 01:38:45.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's anything wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Performance wise.</v>

2291
01:38:46.350 --> 01:38:47.910
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the movement pattern there.</v>

2292
01:38:47.970 --> 01:38:50.100
<v Speaker 2>You're sitting back on your heels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're training.</v>

2293
01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:51.660
<v Speaker 2>Excuse me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're sitting back on your heels,</v>

2294
01:38:51.661 --> 01:38:53.790
<v Speaker 2>you're training yourself to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

2295
01:38:54.420 --> 01:38:59.420
<v Speaker 2>I felt that affect me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I've been in that position where </v>

2296
01:38:59.420 --> 01:38:59.420
<v Speaker 2>I've been training with guys and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2297
01:38:59.420 --> 01:39:00.850
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is this guy taking me down?</v>

2298
01:39:00.860 --> 01:39:05.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm way better than this dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's beating me to the punch every </v>

2299
01:39:05.860 --> 01:39:06.060
<v Speaker 2>time because I was sitting back on my </v>
<v Speaker 2>heels.</v>

2300
01:39:06.061 --> 01:39:08.340
<v Speaker 2>I was in that kettlebell posture when </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm standing there,</v>

2301
01:39:09.620 --> 01:39:12.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm standing there with my back then and</v>
<v Speaker 2>my heels are flat on the ground.</v>

2302
01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:16.740
<v Speaker 2>Why couldn't I get off my toes?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I've trained my body to sit back</v>

2303
01:39:16.741 --> 01:39:18.600
<v Speaker 2>on the heels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>

2304
01:39:18.601 --> 01:39:20.040
<v Speaker 2>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your Body.</v>

2305
01:39:20.041 --> 01:39:22.560
<v Speaker 2>I automatIcally went into that posture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2306
01:39:22.590 --> 01:39:24.150
<v Speaker 2>So you can retrain that though.</v>

2307
01:39:24.150 --> 01:39:26.040
<v Speaker 2>That's the good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It takes some time,</v>

2308
01:39:26.041 --> 01:39:28.090
<v Speaker 2>but he trained the forefoot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're quick around.</v>

2309
01:39:28.590 --> 01:39:30.180
<v Speaker 2>How many times have you heard it in </v>
<v Speaker 2>sports?</v>

2310
01:39:30.181 --> 01:39:31.770
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these guys are on their toes now.</v>

2311
01:39:31.771 --> 01:39:34.200
<v Speaker 2>They really looked great in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

2312
01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:36.480
<v Speaker 2>What do you think about like turkish </v>
<v Speaker 2>getups from grappling?</v>

2313
01:39:36.510 --> 01:39:39.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big fan of those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

2314
01:39:40.530 --> 01:39:42.270
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how that plays into </v>
<v Speaker 2>grappling.</v>

2315
01:39:42.540 --> 01:39:45.090
<v Speaker 2>Just being able to lift heavy weight off</v>
<v Speaker 2>of you,</v>

2316
01:39:45.690 --> 01:39:48.660
<v Speaker 2>get up off your back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have that ct scan like,</v>

2317
01:39:48.661 --> 01:39:49.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think at a high proof,</v>

2318
01:39:50.040 --> 01:39:52.980
<v Speaker 2>really proficient level of jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to lift anything off.</v>

2319
01:39:52.990 --> 01:39:55.230
<v Speaker 2>You're going to move around it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

2320
01:39:55.231 --> 01:39:57.840
<v Speaker 2>like maybe the best shoulder stability,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe.</v>

2321
01:39:57.960 --> 01:40:01.630
<v Speaker 2>Does it help them that way?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's only going to help wherever,</v>

2322
01:40:01.710 --> 01:40:02.850
<v Speaker 2>you know what I don't know.</v>

2323
01:40:03.700 --> 01:40:07.870
<v Speaker 3>This problem with my back and this guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>gave me advice.</v>

2324
01:40:08.200 --> 01:40:12.550
<v Speaker 3>This guy was a strength and conditioning</v>
<v Speaker 3>coach to do a lot of windmills.</v>

2325
01:40:12.730 --> 01:40:14.580
<v Speaker 3>He was like windmills,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2326
01:40:14.630 --> 01:40:18.550
<v Speaker 3>kettlebell wind like dropping down like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that and really good for stabilizing the</v>

2327
01:40:18.551 --> 01:40:21.310
<v Speaker 3>spine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stabilized in the shoulder joint and you</v>

2328
01:40:21.311 --> 01:40:25.580
<v Speaker 3>know that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anything that is in the thoracic area,</v>

2329
01:40:25.760 --> 01:40:29.470
<v Speaker 3>in the cervical area as well?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2330
01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:31.630
<v Speaker 3>What do you think about neck exercises?</v>

2331
01:40:31.930 --> 01:40:35.530
<v Speaker 2>I love him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think on like the neck bridging?</v>

2332
01:40:35.531 --> 01:40:38.080
<v Speaker 2>I think that the desks are so small and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the nac,</v>

2333
01:40:38.110 --> 01:40:43.110
<v Speaker 2>that man I used to do like 45 pound </v>
<v Speaker 2>plates on my chest and do the neck </v>

2334
01:40:43.110 --> 01:40:44.190
<v Speaker 2>bridge is on the back of my head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Real.</v>

2335
01:40:44.191 --> 01:40:49.191
<v Speaker 2>It's just stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got this exercising machine straps </v>

2336
01:40:49.191 --> 01:40:50.920
<v Speaker 2>on your head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you look like a retard,</v>

2337
01:40:50.940 --> 01:40:55.690
<v Speaker 2>like isn't that a good way machine?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that or is it a different thing?</v>

2338
01:40:55.750 --> 01:40:57.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I have a picture or something.</v>

2339
01:40:57.791 --> 01:41:00.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I have a picture on my </v>
<v Speaker 2>instagram or not,</v>

2340
01:41:00.131 --> 01:41:01.220
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

2341
01:41:01.480 --> 01:41:03.220
<v Speaker 2>What's it called?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you call it halo?</v>

2342
01:41:03.700 --> 01:41:04.570
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen that.</v>

2343
01:41:04.600 --> 01:41:09.600
<v Speaker 2>Have you got a strap under the chin and </v>
<v Speaker 2>a velcro strap on the top and you pump </v>

2344
01:41:10.301 --> 01:41:12.340
<v Speaker 2>it up with air and it's like this big </v>
<v Speaker 2>metal thing.</v>

2345
01:41:12.341 --> 01:41:17.341
<v Speaker 2>I mean you look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look ridiculous wearing it and what </v>

2346
01:41:17.341 --> 01:41:17.341
<v Speaker 2>do you do?</v>

2347
01:41:17.341 --> 01:41:18.010
<v Speaker 2>And you can exercise in all ranges of </v>
<v Speaker 2>motion.</v>

2348
01:41:18.011 --> 01:41:23.011
<v Speaker 2>It has like an elastic band that you'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>attach to a wall so you can put just a </v>

2349
01:41:23.011 --> 01:41:26.611
<v Speaker 2>little bit of tension,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tension on it to see if we can find </v>

2350
01:41:26.611 --> 01:41:26.611
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jeremy.</v>

2351
01:41:26.611 --> 01:41:26.611
<v Speaker 2>If not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a video on my phone.</v>

2352
01:41:26.611 --> 01:41:29.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if he can show that on </v>
<v Speaker 2>there but probably will.</v>

2353
01:41:30.520 --> 01:41:32.140
<v Speaker 2>But it's pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you could email it to him,</v>

2354
01:41:32.141 --> 01:41:35.500
<v Speaker 2>he could show it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't give out no battery or though.</v>

2355
01:41:35.860 --> 01:41:38.970
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have a battery charger.</v>

2356
01:41:39.130 --> 01:41:41.220
<v Speaker 2>So I'm sure that's an iphone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2357
01:41:41.450 --> 01:41:42.550
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or this thing.</v>

2358
01:41:42.580 --> 01:41:46.540
<v Speaker 2>Is this it right here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A similar to that halo?</v>

2359
01:41:47.740 --> 01:41:52.740
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this one is a little more hardcore than </v>

2360
01:41:52.740 --> 01:41:52.740
<v Speaker 2>When I got this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>about like seven or 800 bucks.</v>

2361
01:41:53.990 --> 01:41:57.040
<v Speaker 2>Does it have a um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it has a rubber band?</v>

2362
01:41:57.100 --> 01:42:02.100
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's got like a band attachment to that </v>

2363
01:42:02.100 --> 01:42:02.100
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're saying.</v>

2364
01:42:02.100 --> 01:42:03.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'll show you.</v>

2365
01:42:03.250 --> 01:42:05.650
<v Speaker 2>Is there a uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a plug back there somewhere,</v>

2366
01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:09.070
<v Speaker 2>but behind you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it right there.</v>

2367
01:42:09.110 --> 01:42:09.370
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2368
01:42:09.540 --> 01:42:10.750
<v Speaker 2>Take this thing out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2369
01:42:10.751 --> 01:42:15.751
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at this fucking thing spaceship </v>

2370
01:42:15.751 --> 01:42:15.751
<v Speaker 2>looking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2371
01:42:15.751 --> 01:42:16.660
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this,</v>

2372
01:42:16.970 --> 01:42:20.980
<v Speaker 2>I really rotates around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He can hit every angle.</v>

2373
01:42:22.120 --> 01:42:24.460
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the pump up a little.</v>

2374
01:42:25.180 --> 01:42:26.740
<v Speaker 2>So you put it on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2375
01:42:26.741 --> 01:42:28.180
<v Speaker 2>I have seen this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2376
01:42:28.510 --> 01:42:33.510
<v Speaker 2>I've seen this very video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he has this thing on and it's just a </v>

2377
01:42:33.510 --> 01:42:34.930
<v Speaker 2>rubber band.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the resistance.</v>

2378
01:42:35.230 --> 01:42:36.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly like that.</v>

2379
01:42:36.580 --> 01:42:38.120
<v Speaker 2>Or you can use it with like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2380
01:42:38.150 --> 01:42:38.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

2381
01:42:38.700 --> 01:42:40.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he's moving his head,</v>

2382
01:42:40.871 --> 01:42:43.120
<v Speaker 2>in fact running around in a circle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2383
01:42:43.240 --> 01:42:45.010
<v Speaker 2>So you can exercise at all different </v>
<v Speaker 2>angles.</v>

2384
01:42:45.160 --> 01:42:50.160
<v Speaker 2>What is the resistance though?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is the resistance the spinning of his </v>

2385
01:42:50.160 --> 01:42:50.160
<v Speaker 2>head?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So is it pulling a.</v>

2386
01:42:50.160 --> 01:42:52.370
<v Speaker 2>It's a combination of the two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so looks like.</v>

2387
01:42:53.110 --> 01:42:58.110
<v Speaker 2>So if you see it's pulling right there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'll be exercising the side of his </v>

2388
01:42:58.110 --> 01:42:58.110
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he faces it,</v>

2389
01:42:58.110 --> 01:42:58.450
<v Speaker 2>he'll be exercised in the back of his </v>
<v Speaker 2>neck.</v>

2390
01:42:58.480 --> 01:43:03.480
<v Speaker 2>Excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the back side of his neck that he </v>

2391
01:43:03.480 --> 01:43:04.040
<v Speaker 2>looks like he's got a steel cable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he's doing a lat pull.</v>

2392
01:43:04.140 --> 01:43:05.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's probably got it hooked up to like a</v>

2393
01:43:05.920 --> 01:43:09.270
<v Speaker 2>cable machine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I have a guy on training right now.</v>

2394
01:43:09.440 --> 01:43:14.440

<v Speaker 2>he's actually going to Mexico next week </v>

2395
01:43:14.440 --> 01:43:16.351
<v Speaker 2>for a title fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he put on two inches in the last </v>

2396
01:43:16.351 --> 01:43:19.230
<v Speaker 2>month published because that good great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hundred,</v>

2397

<v Speaker 2>eight pounds with a 16 inch neck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She has christ.</v>

2398
01:43:22.930 --> 01:43:27.930
<v Speaker 2>It's called the iron neck dynamic neck </v>
<v Speaker 2>strengthening rotary cable attachment </v>

2399
01:43:27.930 --> 01:43:31.930
<v Speaker 2>gives pointers as he takes a college </v>
<v Speaker 2>football player through the iron neck.</v>

2400
01:43:31.931 --> 01:43:33.590
<v Speaker 2>Basic workout.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

2401
01:43:34.210 --> 01:43:37.660
<v Speaker 2>So you have this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he puts this exact thing on that you got</v>

2402
01:43:37.661 --> 01:43:42.661
<v Speaker 2>right here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then what do you have them do with </v>

2403
01:43:42.661 --> 01:43:42.661
<v Speaker 2>this similar stuff to what you just saw </v>
<v Speaker 2>right there,</v>

2404
01:43:42.661 --> 01:43:44.620
<v Speaker 2>like rotational exercises other than the</v>
<v Speaker 2>neck.</v>

2405
01:43:44.660 --> 01:43:49.660
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's all like circular movements,</v>

2406
01:43:50.051 --> 01:43:52.010
<v Speaker 2>all different movements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that</v>

2407
01:43:52.010 --> 01:43:56.630
<v Speaker 2>doesn't fuck with the discs or anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's a very lightweight.</v>

2408
01:43:56.720 --> 01:44:01.720
<v Speaker 2>Well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to go on there and put </v>

2409
01:44:01.720 --> 01:44:01.720
<v Speaker 2>like 80,</v>
<v Speaker 2>90 pounds,</v>

2410
01:44:01.720 --> 01:44:05.590
<v Speaker 2>100 pounds or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what do you think about those </v>

2411
01:44:05.590 --> 01:44:08.140
<v Speaker 2>traditional ones that people use those </v>
<v Speaker 2>leather things and I'm not a big fan of </v>

2412
01:44:08.140 --> 01:44:11.150
<v Speaker 2>them and I think because it's too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's too linear and again,</v>

2413
01:44:11.151 --> 01:44:13.970
<v Speaker 2>you don't really get the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the stretch out of the muscle.</v>

2414
01:44:14.150 --> 01:44:19.150
<v Speaker 2>It's just like an isotonic contraction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's just the same weight going up </v>

2415
01:44:19.150 --> 01:44:22.691
<v Speaker 2>and down over and over right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you recommend something like that </v>

2416
01:44:22.691 --> 01:44:22.691
<v Speaker 2>to somebody who had a neck injury?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to,</v>

2417
01:44:23.560 --> 01:44:25.640
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think actually I believe they use them</v>

2418
01:44:25.641 --> 01:44:28.050
<v Speaker 2>at the disc institute or the spine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2419
01:44:28.360 --> 01:44:29.270
<v Speaker 2>the place in la,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2420
01:44:29.300 --> 01:44:34.300
<v Speaker 2>marina del rey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the spine or whatever disk or something </v>

2421
01:44:34.300 --> 01:44:34.300
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

2422
01:44:34.300 --> 01:44:34.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they have it there.</v>

2423
01:44:34.430 --> 01:44:36.380
<v Speaker 2>So they use that for rehabilitation?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe so,</v>

2424
01:44:36.381 --> 01:44:38.950
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because there's a lot of um,</v>

2425
01:44:39.530 --> 01:44:40.790
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2426
01:44:40.820 --> 01:44:42.830
<v Speaker 2>kelly started again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate to bring him up again,</v>

2427
01:44:42.831 --> 01:44:43.970
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

2428
01:44:43.971 --> 01:44:48.971
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he hates a lot of these machines that </v>

2429
01:44:48.971 --> 01:44:51.551
<v Speaker 2>are out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like those machines where you can say </v>

2430
01:44:51.551 --> 01:44:51.551
<v Speaker 2>neck flexion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>extension and all that stuff.</v>

2431
01:44:51.551 --> 01:44:53.390
<v Speaker 2>You hate those things too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't hate,</v>

2432
01:44:53.540 --> 01:44:56.470
<v Speaker 2>but I just don't use them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2433
01:44:56.550 --> 01:45:00.620
<v Speaker 2>I think it's to the pattern of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement is to linear,</v>

2434
01:45:00.770 --> 01:45:03.290
<v Speaker 2>it's not efficient enough for like </v>
<v Speaker 2>sports and stuff,</v>

2435
01:45:03.340 --> 01:45:08.340
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it doesn't mimic how you would use </v>

2436
01:45:08.340 --> 01:45:10.631
<v Speaker 2>the neck in real life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seemed like a squat or maybe a bench </v>

2437
01:45:10.631 --> 01:45:10.631
<v Speaker 2>press,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

2438
01:45:10.631 --> 01:45:13.430
<v Speaker 2>So I think if there would be a way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>strengthen your neck up,</v>

2439
01:45:14.030 --> 01:45:16.160
<v Speaker 2>that would be really crucial for </v>
<v Speaker 2>striking sports.</v>

2440
01:45:16.160 --> 01:45:19.340
<v Speaker 2>Anything where your head's getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>jolted back more than it should.</v>

2441
01:45:19.790 --> 01:45:21.920
<v Speaker 2>And then the endurance of the neck as </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2442
01:45:21.921 --> 01:45:23.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in a longer bout,</v>

2443
01:45:23.510 --> 01:45:24.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2444
01:45:24.320 --> 01:45:27.470
<v Speaker 2>you can't resist anymore and pop your </v>
<v Speaker 2>head flies back.</v>

2445
01:45:27.530 --> 01:45:31.520
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely kind of doing their thing has</v>
<v Speaker 2>been shown to reduce concussion.</v>

2446
01:45:31.550 --> 01:45:34.240
<v Speaker 2>Like the damage from head injuries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

2447
01:45:34.400 --> 01:45:36.710
<v Speaker 2>So that line,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we use that frequently.</v>

2448
01:45:36.711 --> 01:45:38.630
<v Speaker 2>You can do it also with like an exercise</v>
<v Speaker 2>ball,</v>

2449
01:45:38.631 --> 01:45:40.100
<v Speaker 2>you can put it against the wall and </v>
<v Speaker 2>roll,</v>

2450
01:45:40.130 --> 01:45:41.450
<v Speaker 2>roll your head against it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2451
01:45:41.790 --> 01:45:43.800
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of different ways you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>use a towel.</v>

2452
01:45:43.801 --> 01:45:48.801
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've got a lot of different </v>

2453
01:45:48.801 --> 01:45:48.801
<v Speaker 2>modalities I use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2454
01:45:48.801 --> 01:45:48.801
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

2455
01:45:48.801 --> 01:45:48.960
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

2456
01:45:49.060 --> 01:45:54.060
<v Speaker 2>we really focus with roselawn like </v>
<v Speaker 2>durability for this training to really </v>

2457
01:45:55.161 --> 01:45:58.970
<v Speaker 2>building the abdominals and the obliques</v>
<v Speaker 2>and lower back and the neck.</v>

2458
01:45:59.300 --> 01:46:04.300
<v Speaker 2>And what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what kind of exercises do for the </v>

2459
01:46:04.300 --> 01:46:04.300
<v Speaker 2>abdominals?</v>

2460
01:46:04.300 --> 01:46:04.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like the,</v>

2461
01:46:04.640 --> 01:46:09.640
<v Speaker 2>we call it the horse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the glute ham machine can do a lot </v>

2462
01:46:09.640 --> 01:46:11.420
<v Speaker 2>of abdominal exercises on there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can like the russian twist.</v>

2463
01:46:11.421 --> 01:46:13.820
<v Speaker 2>I like that exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like a lot of medicine ball,</v>

2464
01:46:13.821 --> 01:46:16.910
<v Speaker 2>rotational medicine ball throws.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the glute ham machine,</v>

2465
01:46:16.911 --> 01:46:19.080
<v Speaker 2>you're like leaning back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

2466
01:46:19.081 --> 01:46:21.270
<v Speaker 2>I back on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the big pattern.</v>

2467
01:46:21.470 --> 01:46:22.370
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That one.</v>

2468
01:46:22.371 --> 01:46:23.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do you,</v>

2469
01:46:23.631 --> 01:46:25.210
<v Speaker 2>why do you like that one particularly?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2470
01:46:25.220 --> 01:46:28.770
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty versatile I think for,</v>

2471
01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:33.800
<v Speaker 2>for how basic it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's pretty versatile as far as </v>

2472
01:46:33.800 --> 01:46:36.521
<v Speaker 2>like the amount of exercises and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the how specific you get with each </v>

2473
01:46:36.521 --> 01:46:38.850
<v Speaker 2>muscle group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if I want to target your obliques,</v>

2474
01:46:38.870 --> 01:46:42.590
<v Speaker 2>like I can hit that oblique so easily </v>
<v Speaker 2>just by turning your hip a certain way,</v>

2475
01:46:43.100 --> 01:46:48.100
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I can find all these little weak </v>

2476
01:46:48.100 --> 01:46:50.081
<v Speaker 2>areas in the abdominals and the feet </v>
<v Speaker 2>lock in on sort of a similar way to like</v>

2477
01:46:50.341 --> 01:46:52.620
<v Speaker 2>an old school like sit up bench.</v>

2478
01:46:52.620 --> 01:46:53.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

2479
01:46:53.850 --> 01:46:56.850
<v Speaker 2>And when you do house those old school </v>
<v Speaker 2>set up benches of those,</v>

2480
01:46:57.960 --> 01:46:59.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't think so.</v>

2481
01:46:59.161 --> 01:47:01.020
<v Speaker 2>I think you can get some good work done </v>
<v Speaker 2>on those.</v>

2482
01:47:01.021 --> 01:47:01.890
<v Speaker 2>Believe it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like yeah,</v>

2483
01:47:01.891 --> 01:47:04.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're not as good as the uh,</v>

2484
01:47:04.810 --> 01:47:06.960
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my preferences is the glue.</v>

2485
01:47:07.170 --> 01:47:08.850
<v Speaker 2>I like that better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the glute ham.</v>

2486
01:47:08.910 --> 01:47:09.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

2487
01:47:09.541 --> 01:47:10.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

2488
01:47:10.770 --> 01:47:13.450
<v Speaker 2>that's a guy facing forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You haven't faced backwards as well.</v>

2489
01:47:13.550 --> 01:47:14.520
<v Speaker 2>Go both ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2490
01:47:14.521 --> 01:47:16.760
<v Speaker 2>Lower back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to get back in there and,</v>

2491
01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:22.000
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that machine seems like it would </v>

2492
01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:22.000
<v Speaker 2>give you some spinal decompression as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

2493
01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.120
<v Speaker 2>It's phenomenal for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the lower back.</v>

2494
01:47:24.121 --> 01:47:29.121
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and is that guy holding a weight in his </v>

2495
01:47:29.121 --> 01:47:30.060
<v Speaker 2>chest when he's doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look up that those two guys doing</v>

2496
01:47:30.061 --> 01:47:32.490
<v Speaker 2>on the right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're banging what to do it.</v>

2497
01:47:32.580 --> 01:47:33.640
<v Speaker 2>If you're in a bad guy.</v>

2498
01:47:34.110 --> 01:47:35.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck is that?</v>

2499
01:47:35.900 --> 01:47:38.450
<v Speaker 2>That's the same guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two different phases.</v>

2500
01:47:39.290 --> 01:47:39.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2501
01:47:39.960 --> 01:47:42.750
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of banging his buddy.</v>

2502
01:47:43.080 --> 01:47:44.640
<v Speaker 2>That's how you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was pretty interesting.</v>

2503
01:47:44.641 --> 01:47:49.641
<v Speaker 2>You know how that was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know how the machine was invented </v>

2504
01:47:49.641 --> 01:47:52.180
<v Speaker 2>was the russians took a pommel horse and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they moved it up to the law.</v>

2505
01:47:52.181 --> 01:47:56.430
<v Speaker 2>They took a two by four on the wall and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they just put their feet on the wall and</v>

2506
01:47:56.930 --> 01:47:59.010
<v Speaker 2>back extensions over it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No shit.</v>

2507
01:47:59.070 --> 01:47:59.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty cool.</v>

2508
01:47:59.761 --> 01:48:01.140
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is pretty cool.</v>

2509
01:48:01.141 --> 01:48:03.200
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen the reverse hyper?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2510
01:48:03.210 --> 01:48:03.690
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have.</v>

2511
01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:04.880
<v Speaker 2>What do you think about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2512
01:48:04.960 --> 01:48:06.930
<v Speaker 2>I think it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's one of those back there.</v>

2513
01:48:07.490 --> 01:48:08.490
<v Speaker 2>I love that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2514
01:48:08.491 --> 01:48:09.750
<v Speaker 2>I think there's some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that better?</v>

2515
01:48:09.990 --> 01:48:14.990
<v Speaker 2>Do you think through the glute ham?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the way you do the exercise is </v>

2516
01:48:14.990 --> 01:48:15.480
<v Speaker 2>the most important.</v>

2517
01:48:16.410 --> 01:48:19.020
<v Speaker 2>That's the key to what's cool about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>reverse.</v>

2518
01:48:19.021 --> 01:48:21.370
<v Speaker 2>Hyper is on the descending.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2519
01:48:21.390 --> 01:48:24.600
<v Speaker 2>it's got like an active decompression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like releasing.</v>

2520
01:48:24.690 --> 01:48:25.260
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that right?</v>

2521
01:48:25.261 --> 01:48:26.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you feel.</v>

2522
01:48:26.251 --> 01:48:26.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2523
01:48:26.670 --> 01:48:31.670
<v Speaker 2>Like fully on your lower back slightly </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you lifting up and </v>

2524
01:48:31.670 --> 01:48:31.670
<v Speaker 2>strengthening all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2525
01:48:31.670 --> 01:48:36.480
<v Speaker 2>So now this like for sports performance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the speed of which you do that would be </v>

2526
01:48:36.480 --> 01:48:40.551
<v Speaker 2>a crucial factor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to feel the stretch out of the </v>

2527
01:48:40.551 --> 01:48:43.401
<v Speaker 2>tendons and ligaments before it fires </v>
<v Speaker 2>back up and the weight that you would </v>

2528
01:48:43.401 --> 01:48:44.020
<v Speaker 2>put on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much weight put on.</v>

2529
01:48:44.910 --> 01:48:48.230
<v Speaker 2>Maybe maybe start off with two and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>half pound ankle weights first.</v>

2530
01:48:48.320 --> 01:48:48.980
<v Speaker 2>Real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2531
01:48:49.110 --> 01:48:49.970
<v Speaker 2>See it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2532
01:48:50.170 --> 01:48:53.740
<v Speaker 2>and just build it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you would explode up lower down.</v>

2533
01:48:54.290 --> 01:48:59.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't load guys up with weight unless </v>
<v Speaker 2>the quality and the speed of the </v>

2534
01:48:59.290 --> 01:49:02.700
<v Speaker 2>movement and the speed will not be </v>
<v Speaker 2>compromised.</v>

2535
01:49:02.730 --> 01:49:05.120
<v Speaker 2>So if that's compromised and there's no </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense in moving it up,</v>

2536
01:49:05.190 --> 01:49:08.250
<v Speaker 2>for me it's all about getting the guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>faster.</v>

2537
01:49:08.400 --> 01:49:11.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm producing more forced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

2538
01:49:11.280 --> 01:49:16.280
<v Speaker 2>So do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you have a guy like dos anjos and </v>

2539
01:49:16.280 --> 01:49:16.280
<v Speaker 2>you obviously got them in incredible </v>
<v Speaker 2>shape,</v>

2540
01:49:16.500 --> 01:49:20.730
<v Speaker 2>do you incorporate any traditional </v>
<v Speaker 2>exercises that people are familiar with?</v>

2541
01:49:20.731 --> 01:49:25.230
<v Speaker 2>Like say hill sprints or sand bags or </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything and he'll like,</v>

2542
01:49:25.560 --> 01:49:28.200
<v Speaker 2>he'll sprinting is kind of like old </v>
<v Speaker 2>school,</v>

2543
01:49:28.201 --> 01:49:30.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I used to do that shit like crazy,</v>

2544
01:49:30.211 --> 01:49:32.640
<v Speaker 2>but fuck man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I pushed myself to the limit.</v>

2545
01:49:32.641 --> 01:49:35.070
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my heart rate's like 190.</v>

2546
01:49:35.071 --> 01:49:36.750
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really pushing it out.</v>

2547
01:49:36.751 --> 01:49:40.050
<v Speaker 2>$100.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it slows you down.</v>

2548
01:49:40.051 --> 01:49:43.440
<v Speaker 2>You just sprinting should be for done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for speed again.</v>

2549
01:49:43.500 --> 01:49:45.720
<v Speaker 2>So running up a hill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would you try to go fast?</v>

2550
01:49:45.740 --> 01:49:47.250
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're running against resistance,</v>

2551
01:49:47.260 --> 01:49:52.260
<v Speaker 2>you're making yourself slow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's actually been shown that it's </v>

2552
01:49:52.260 --> 01:49:52.260
<v Speaker 2>proven.</v>

2553
01:49:52.260 --> 01:49:52.840
<v Speaker 2>You can look this up on the strength and</v>
<v Speaker 2>conditioning manuals,</v>

2554
01:49:52.841 --> 01:49:55.280
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That a downhIll ski,</v>

2555
01:49:55.310 --> 01:50:00.310
<v Speaker 2>downhill sprinting has been shown to </v>
<v Speaker 2>increase the top speed and sprinters </v>

2556
01:50:00.310 --> 01:50:03.661
<v Speaker 2>performance downhill because </v>
<v Speaker 2>decelerating that because because it's </v>

2557
01:50:03.661 --> 01:50:05.590
<v Speaker 2>forcing your body to adapt to a higher </v>
<v Speaker 2>speed.</v>

2558
01:50:06.790 --> 01:50:09.100
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So instead you're going up hills,</v>

2559
01:50:09.101 --> 01:50:11.470
<v Speaker 2>you're forcing your body to adapt to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>slower speed,</v>

2560
01:50:12.790 --> 01:50:16.000
<v Speaker 2>but you feel like you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking face plant at any moment.</v>

2561
01:50:16.020 --> 01:50:21.020
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the biggest misconception with </v>

2562
01:50:21.020 --> 01:50:24.511
<v Speaker 2>all the resistance type training is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>somehow you're going to put the weight </v>

2563
01:50:24.511 --> 01:50:25.860
<v Speaker 2>down and you're going to move faster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2564
01:50:26.260 --> 01:50:27.860
<v Speaker 2>People believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but why?</v>

2565
01:50:29.260 --> 01:50:32.820
<v Speaker 2>Because you can lift the heavier weight </v>
<v Speaker 2>and so your muscles are stronger.</v>

2566
01:50:32.830 --> 01:50:35.560
<v Speaker 2>It makes you faster at exactly that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't work that one out.</v>

2567
01:50:35.650 --> 01:50:40.650
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't work that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a study on power lifters </v>

2568
01:50:40.650 --> 01:50:41.730
<v Speaker 2>that they found out the power lifters </v>
<v Speaker 2>that increase their,</v>

2569
01:50:41.740 --> 01:50:46.740
<v Speaker 2>their ability to do vertical leaps and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of other different explosive </v>

2570
01:50:46.740 --> 01:50:47.710
<v Speaker 2>exercises just because of power lifting.</v>

2571
01:50:47.740 --> 01:50:50.650
<v Speaker 2>there might be some truth to that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>olympic lifting as well.</v>

2572
01:50:50.651 --> 01:50:55.651
<v Speaker 2>They found their good sprinters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you would say that that </v>

2573
01:50:55.651 --> 01:50:55.651
<v Speaker 2>strengthening of the feet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2574
01:50:55.651 --> 01:50:59.900
<v Speaker 2>I'd say that has a lot to do with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also the strength of the quadriceps </v>

2575
01:50:59.900 --> 01:51:00.460
<v Speaker 2>and relation to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2576
01:51:00.461 --> 01:51:02.380
<v Speaker 2>the lag in relation to the rest of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>

2577
01:51:02.381 --> 01:51:07.381
<v Speaker 2>But how do they Move laterally?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do they move rotationally that's </v>

2578
01:51:07.381 --> 01:51:08.300
<v Speaker 2>where they're deficient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2579
01:51:08.310 --> 01:51:13.310
<v Speaker 2>when you see a really big bulky guy in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ufc becomes super obvious when they </v>

2580
01:51:13.310 --> 01:51:15.040
<v Speaker 2>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a guy who can move moves real good.</v>

2581
01:51:15.650 --> 01:51:17.890
<v Speaker 2>They're almost like stuck in mud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2582
01:51:17.980 --> 01:51:20.000
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you seat,</v>

2583
01:51:20.010 --> 01:51:23.050
<v Speaker 2>but for some guys like their style,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like who's smart?</v>

2584
01:51:23.051 --> 01:51:24.350
<v Speaker 2>Paul harris,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2585
01:51:24.580 --> 01:51:29.580
<v Speaker 2>he's a guy where that big beefy fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>build he always tried to do is grab a </v>

2586
01:51:29.591 --> 01:51:30.730
<v Speaker 2>hold of your leg and rip it apart.</v>

2587
01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:36.000
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost for him it seems to benefit </v>

2588
01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.290
<v Speaker 2>him to be like really over muscular and </v>
<v Speaker 2>super strong because he's,</v>

2589
01:51:38.680 --> 01:51:43.680
<v Speaker 2>he's about that very small movement or </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're very small group of movements </v>

2590
01:51:43.680 --> 01:51:48.301
<v Speaker 2>rather.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty interesting because I'm </v>

2591
01:51:48.301 --> 01:51:48.301
<v Speaker 2>actually training another guy from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ufc.</v>

2592
01:51:48.301 --> 01:51:48.460
<v Speaker 2>I just started working with him aBout a </v>
<v Speaker 2>month ago.</v>

2593
01:51:48.461 --> 01:51:53.461
<v Speaker 2>Ricardo dementia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A braille cyborg.</v>

2594
01:51:54.090 --> 01:51:55.780
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ricardo,</v>

2595
01:51:56.250 --> 01:52:01.250
<v Speaker 2>ricardo brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's this guy is another really good </v>

2596
01:52:01.250 --> 01:52:02.520
<v Speaker 2>jujitsu guy from Brazil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this guy is on the ufc a,</v>

2597
01:52:02.530 --> 01:52:05.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how many fights he has now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe this will be the second or third.</v>

2598
01:52:05.291 --> 01:52:10.291
<v Speaker 2>I think he's Pretty new.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think of a cyborg or fighting on the </v>

2599
01:52:10.291 --> 01:52:10.890
<v Speaker 2>june.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sixth garde.</v>

2600
01:52:10.930 --> 01:52:12.470
<v Speaker 2>I think there's one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2601
01:52:12.780 --> 01:52:14.680
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably the fight night.</v>

2602
01:52:14.690 --> 01:52:15.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2603
01:52:15.300 --> 01:52:17.290
<v Speaker 2>He's fighting on that one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2604
01:52:17.291 --> 01:52:18.160
<v Speaker 2>there he is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2605

<v Speaker 2>That's him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many fights in the ufc a?</v>

2606
01:52:23.500 --> 01:52:25.960
<v Speaker 2>Just want one fight night.</v>

2607
01:52:25.960 --> 01:52:29.530
<v Speaker 2>rear naked choke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He fight what nurse?</v>

2608
01:52:29.540 --> 01:52:31.540
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's another guy.</v>

2609
01:52:31.541 --> 01:52:34.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean you look at this guy and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>just like freakishly bill.</v>

2610
01:52:34.770 --> 01:52:38.140
<v Speaker 2>He was in the Brazil card,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the meo chick versus maldonado car.</v>

2611
01:52:38.560 --> 01:52:43.560
<v Speaker 2>Really good jujitsu to the hydro gracie </v>
<v Speaker 2>and all those guys and it's like really?</v>

2612
01:52:44.500 --> 01:52:46.790
<v Speaker 2>But he is classic case of a guy who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>lifting.</v>

2613
01:52:46.970 --> 01:52:51.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's huge but just ripped a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's lifting all these heavyweights </v>

2614
01:52:51.970 --> 01:52:52.850
<v Speaker 2>slowly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

2615
01:52:53.930 --> 01:52:55.430
<v Speaker 2>I got them out to their first day </v>
<v Speaker 2>sprinting.</v>

2616
01:52:55.490 --> 01:52:58.420
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't believe how slow forgot was </v>
<v Speaker 2>slower.</v>

2617
01:52:58.430 --> 01:53:00.320
<v Speaker 2>Molasses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Blew my freaking mind.</v>

2618
01:53:00.321 --> 01:53:03.740
<v Speaker 2>Here's this gigantic muscle bound guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the guy couldn't.</v>

2619
01:53:03.910 --> 01:53:05.900
<v Speaker 2>It looked like he was jogging.</v>
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>

2620
01:53:05.901 --> 01:53:10.901
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I take it slow because you thought </v>

2621
01:53:10.901 --> 01:53:12.851
<v Speaker 2>you're going to torture him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now did go slow to get that time and </v>

2622
01:53:12.851 --> 01:53:14.420
<v Speaker 2>then I have them do like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a throw off,</v>

2623
01:53:14.421 --> 01:53:17.420
<v Speaker 2>like what I showed you with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>plyometric bench press type movement,</v>

2624
01:53:17.460 --> 01:53:20.230
<v Speaker 2>like maybe like 45 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2625
01:53:21.140 --> 01:53:24.020
<v Speaker 2>Guy can barely throw it off six inches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

2626
01:53:24.050 --> 01:53:29.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because his muscles are trained to be </v>

2627
01:53:29.050 --> 01:53:30.851
<v Speaker 2>short and slow here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the body remembers the movement </v>

2628
01:53:30.851 --> 01:53:31.820
<v Speaker 2>pattern and the speed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just,</v>

2629
01:53:32.600 --> 01:53:37.600
<v Speaker 2>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're training slow twitch and now </v>

2630
01:53:37.600 --> 01:53:39.590
<v Speaker 2>already a month later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like getting huge gains.</v>

2631
01:53:40.430 --> 01:53:43.700
<v Speaker 2>Getting explosive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like friday was a breakthrough day,</v>

2632
01:53:43.900 --> 01:53:45.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a month later.</v>

2633
01:53:45.590 --> 01:53:47.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>

2634
01:53:47.560 --> 01:53:48.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>

2635
01:53:48.621 --> 01:53:51.350
<v Speaker 2>So you would take a guy like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a good example.</v>

2636
01:53:51.590 --> 01:53:54.530
<v Speaker 2>Fic fairy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously fricking huge.</v>

2637
01:53:54.531 --> 01:53:55.000
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2638
01:53:55.010 --> 01:53:57.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what do you do with a girl like that?</v>

2639
01:53:57.020 --> 01:54:00.590
<v Speaker 2>Like what's the first thing you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>First thing I do is get a moving dynamic</v>

2640
01:54:00.591 --> 01:54:05.591
<v Speaker 2>movements,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting him to move a little quicker on </v>

2641
01:54:05.591 --> 01:54:06.350
<v Speaker 2>his feet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>learning how more coordination exercises</v>

2642
01:54:06.740 --> 01:54:11.740
<v Speaker 2>but keeping him loose and dynamic rather</v>
<v Speaker 2>than anything that's tense and going to </v>

2643
01:54:11.740 --> 01:54:15.761
<v Speaker 2>tighten them up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like even the shadow boxing a month </v>

2644
01:54:15.761 --> 01:54:15.870
<v Speaker 2>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just like,</v>

2645
01:54:15.871 --> 01:54:17.360
<v Speaker 2>like it looks like slow motion now.</v>

2646
01:54:17.360 --> 01:54:18.830
<v Speaker 2>It looks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks pretty good.</v>

2647
01:54:18.900 --> 01:54:22.580
<v Speaker 2>Like that's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can do such so much progress or make</v>

2648
01:54:22.581 --> 01:54:24.950
<v Speaker 2>so much progress happen in such a short </v>
<v Speaker 2>period of time.</v>

2649
01:54:25.010 --> 01:54:25.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

2650
01:54:25.910 --> 01:54:27.500
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2651
01:54:27.501 --> 01:54:28.160
<v Speaker 2>it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2652
01:54:28.161 --> 01:54:30.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm not gonna say it was easy because </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is one of the harder cases.</v>

2653
01:54:30.681 --> 01:54:33.350
<v Speaker 2>Usually it takes about two weeks before </v>
<v Speaker 2>I start seeing a difference.</v>

2654
01:54:33.830 --> 01:54:35.090
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>

2655
01:54:35.091 --> 01:54:37.790
<v Speaker 2>once you get that breakthrough and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>start seeing them moving differently and</v>

2656
01:54:37.791 --> 01:54:38.420
<v Speaker 2>quicker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2657
01:54:38.421 --> 01:54:40.370
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's on from there it's like okay,</v>

2658
01:54:40.371 --> 01:54:45.371
<v Speaker 2>now we can start really progressing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>hitting the nervous system with really </v>

2659
01:54:45.371 --> 01:54:46.940
<v Speaker 2>like intense plyometrics and stuff like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2660
01:54:47.210 --> 01:54:50.390
<v Speaker 2>How cutting edge is this style of </v>
<v Speaker 2>training?</v>

2661
01:54:50.391 --> 01:54:54.020
<v Speaker 2>I mean marinovich did he invent all </v>
<v Speaker 2>tests or marv?</v>

2662
01:54:54.290 --> 01:54:57.980
<v Speaker 2>Marv did was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he took a scientific studies from,</v>

2663
01:54:58.010 --> 01:55:03.010
<v Speaker 2>from what the russians had developed </v>
<v Speaker 2>back during the cold war period and he </v>

2664
01:55:03.010 --> 01:55:05.330
<v Speaker 2>translated into his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his exercises.</v>

2665
01:55:05.750 --> 01:55:10.750
<v Speaker 2>And so I'd say at least 80 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what I'm doing is stuff that he's come </v>

2666
01:55:10.750 --> 01:55:12.630
<v Speaker 2>up with 80 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2667
01:55:12.650 --> 01:55:13.490
<v Speaker 2>maybe 75,</v>
<v Speaker 2>80.</v>

2668
01:55:13.491 --> 01:55:14.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But something like that.</v>

2669
01:55:14.630 --> 01:55:17.420
<v Speaker 2>And how did you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you do like an internship with him?</v>

2670
01:55:17.421 --> 01:55:20.900
<v Speaker 2>Like how to do that and even if it's not</v>
<v Speaker 2>what he's doing,</v>

2671
01:55:20.930 --> 01:55:22.810
<v Speaker 2>it's something along the lines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2672
01:55:22.820 --> 01:55:25.670
<v Speaker 2>it's something similar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very heavily influenced by what the</v>

2673
01:55:25.671 --> 01:55:28.430
<v Speaker 2>russians came up with and their studies </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the nervous system.</v>

2674
01:55:29.060 --> 01:55:31.810
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so mark took these things and translated</v>

2675
01:55:31.820 --> 01:55:34.310
<v Speaker 2>in exercises and it's just been </v>
<v Speaker 2>phenomenal.</v>

2676
01:55:34.311 --> 01:55:34.880
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2677
01:55:34.881 --> 01:55:37.550
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really,</v>

2678
01:55:37.551 --> 01:55:38.750
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got to try it,</v>

2679
01:55:38.751 --> 01:55:39.420
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2680
01:55:39.540 --> 01:55:42.020
<v Speaker 2>I believe you can work out with me for </v>
<v Speaker 2>two weeks.</v>

2681
01:55:42.021 --> 01:55:44.070
<v Speaker 2>I changed your life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're way the fuck down</v>

2682
01:55:44.080 --> 01:55:45.690
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where are you?</v>

2683
01:55:46.500 --> 01:55:48.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm in woodland hills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh look,</v>

2684
01:55:48.241 --> 01:55:50.790

<v Speaker 1>Burbank.</v>

2685
01:55:50.791 --> 01:55:51.180
<v Speaker 1>We're all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2686
01:55:51.181 --> 01:55:52.570
<v Speaker 1>let's do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2687
01:55:52.650 --> 01:55:54.060
<v Speaker 1>Do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would love to.</v>

2688
01:55:54.090 --> 01:55:55.310
<v Speaker 1>I would love to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your life.</v>

2689
01:55:55.410 --> 01:55:58.360
<v Speaker 1>You're a guy with an open mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd be blown away at the differences.</v>

2690
01:55:58.380 --> 01:56:03.380
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would love to just from the point of </v>

2691
01:56:03.380 --> 01:56:03.380
<v Speaker 1>view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all for a person always,</v>

2692
01:56:03.380 --> 01:56:04.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm always trying to work on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2693
01:56:04.650 --> 01:56:08.520
<v Speaker 1>different things and improve different </v>
<v Speaker 1>things about my performance physically,</v>

2694
01:56:08.521 --> 01:56:12.210
<v Speaker 1>but I also as a commentator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it would help.</v>

2695
01:56:12.300 --> 01:56:16.010
<v Speaker 1>I figured that's one thing I really </v>
<v Speaker 1>liked joe,</v>

2696
01:56:16.020 --> 01:56:21.020
<v Speaker 1>is how you've educated the fat and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>is something I think maybe boxing needs </v>

2697
01:56:21.020 --> 01:56:24.090
<v Speaker 1>a little bit more of is like educating </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fans on the different techniques and</v>

2698
01:56:24.091 --> 01:56:26.720
<v Speaker 1>strategies of the fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You remember that one fight?</v>

2699
01:56:26.730 --> 01:56:29.430
<v Speaker 1>I think it waS who was anderson silva </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the crowd was bullying.</v>

2700
01:56:29.460 --> 01:56:31.470
<v Speaker 1>I think it was anderson facility one and</v>
<v Speaker 1>crowds bullying.</v>

2701
01:56:31.471 --> 01:56:32.380
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are you building?</v>

2702
01:56:32.540 --> 01:56:36.240
<v Speaker 1>That was like a great performance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like fucking strategic performance.</v>

2703
01:56:36.540 --> 01:56:38.760
<v Speaker 1>Well I loved floyd mayweather versus </v>
<v Speaker 1>pack.</v>

2704
01:56:38.761 --> 01:56:39.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't know.</v>

2705
01:56:39.571 --> 01:56:42.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I love skill.</v>

2706
01:56:43.050 --> 01:56:44.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean very important to me.</v>

2707
01:56:44.970 --> 01:56:46.500
<v Speaker 1>I didn't love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I respect it.</v>

2708
01:56:46.610 --> 01:56:49.470
<v Speaker 1>Like I respect me whether skill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he's a phenomenal boxer.</v>

2709
01:56:49.740 --> 01:56:52.110
<v Speaker 1>I just would've liked to see it for 200 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million bucks.</v>

2710
01:56:52.120 --> 01:56:57.120
<v Speaker 1>Like go for the kill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you know that guy's tired on the </v>

2711
01:56:57.120 --> 01:56:57.570
<v Speaker 1>twelfth round?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Put a little something out there for the</v>

2712
01:56:57.571 --> 01:56:58.510
<v Speaker 1>fans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2713
01:56:58.620 --> 01:57:03.620
<v Speaker 1>I loved it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't love it as much as I love </v>

2714
01:57:03.620 --> 01:57:03.620
<v Speaker 1>canelo alvarez.</v>
<v Speaker 1>James kirkland.</v>

2715
01:57:03.770 --> 01:57:06.590
<v Speaker 1>that was more or matisa and provide the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cost.</v>

2716
01:57:06.780 --> 01:57:09.990
<v Speaker 1>That was more my mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was definitely more crazy and watch</v>

2717
01:57:10.680 --> 01:57:12.840
<v Speaker 1>one of my favorite fights of all time in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ufc.</v>

2718
01:57:12.840 --> 01:57:14.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's been a few favorite </v>
<v Speaker 1>fights,</v>

2719
01:57:14.581 --> 01:57:18.240
<v Speaker 1>but dan henderson versus shogun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was just phenomenal.</v>

2720
01:57:18.241 --> 01:57:19.880
<v Speaker 1>I just watched that the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2721
01:57:19.980 --> 01:57:24.980
<v Speaker 1>Oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't be brain damaged just </v>

2722
01:57:24.980 --> 01:57:27.231
<v Speaker 1>watching it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other one I watched the other day </v>

2723
01:57:27.231 --> 01:57:29.091
<v Speaker 1>was the don frye bush versus a takiyama </v>
<v Speaker 1>that exchange,</v>

2724
01:57:31.510 --> 01:57:36.510
<v Speaker 1>two of them were in the corner and we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>just color tie haymaker haymaker out of </v>

2725
01:57:37.970 --> 01:57:38.970
<v Speaker 1>his eyeball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

2726
01:57:38.971 --> 01:57:40.500
<v Speaker 1>that was insanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>

2727
01:57:40.560 --> 01:57:45.560
<v Speaker 1>That was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of those pride fights were fucking </v>

2728
01:57:45.560 --> 01:57:45.560
<v Speaker 1>absolutely nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

2729
01:57:45.560 --> 01:57:50.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fan of skill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's why I said mighty mouse is </v>

2730
01:57:50.490 --> 01:57:53.481
<v Speaker 1>like one of my favorite guys to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But vanderbilt is probably my all time </v>

2731
01:57:53.481 --> 01:57:54.060
<v Speaker 1>favorite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although vendor skillful.</v>

2732
01:57:54.270 --> 01:57:59.270
<v Speaker 1>What I loved about vandelay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which juSt you knew you're going to see </v>

2733
01:57:59.270 --> 01:58:00.330
<v Speaker 1>some fucking chaos and that guy got in </v>
<v Speaker 1>and started rolling his knuckles.</v>

2734
01:58:00.630 --> 01:58:05.630
<v Speaker 1>You're going to see some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so happy that he got that lifetime </v>

2735
01:58:05.630 --> 01:58:07.880
<v Speaker 1>ban rescinded and I don't know whether </v>
<v Speaker 1>or not he was on.</v>

2736
01:58:07.890 --> 01:58:12.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the fuck he was on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do know that the vast majority of </v>

2737
01:58:12.901 --> 01:58:17.901
<v Speaker 1>those guys are doing something to help </v>
<v Speaker 1>them recover in and when you take a guy </v>

2738
01:58:17.901 --> 01:58:19.980
<v Speaker 1>and you take away his livelihood </v>
<v Speaker 1>forever,</v>

2739
01:58:20.010 --> 01:58:23.340
<v Speaker 1>you see you can never fight again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That to me is just disgusting.</v>

2740
01:58:23.400 --> 01:58:26.490
<v Speaker 1>It's disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't do that to come lead to right.</v>

2741
01:58:26.720 --> 01:58:28.450
<v Speaker 1>Or then they send it back or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2742
01:58:29.180 --> 01:58:33.570
<v Speaker 1>they were going to give him a one year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so suspended a one year suspension.</v>

2743
01:58:33.600 --> 01:58:36.780
<v Speaker 1>They were going to give him nine months </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they tried to shift it to one year.</v>

2744
01:58:36.781 --> 01:58:40.590
<v Speaker 1>He had agreed to nine months and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they try to shift it to one year,</v>

2745
01:58:40.591 --> 01:58:42.040
<v Speaker 1>that's when he started hearing</v>

2746
01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:46.540
<v Speaker 3>all these people on the internet that </v>
<v Speaker 3>were saying that the tests that they did</v>

2747
01:58:46.570 --> 01:58:51.570
<v Speaker 3>were not proper,</v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't handle either ms dot handled or</v>

2748
01:58:51.581 --> 01:58:54.130
<v Speaker 3>what it wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The protocol wasn't estaBlished.</v>

2749
01:58:54.131 --> 01:58:58.300
<v Speaker 3>So what the ufc did is they kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>overstepped their ability,</v>

2750
01:58:58.630 --> 01:59:00.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you're going to have someone get</v>

2751
01:59:00.910 --> 01:59:05.910
<v Speaker 3>tested,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you really have to have some water type </v>

2752
01:59:05.910 --> 01:59:09.090
<v Speaker 3>organization come in and handle it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People that have been doing that </v>

2753
01:59:09.090 --> 01:59:12.391
<v Speaker 3>forever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people that handle the testing did </v>

2754
01:59:12.391 --> 01:59:13.480
<v Speaker 3>not do the best job so that the results </v>
<v Speaker 3>were in question.</v>

2755
01:59:13.481 --> 01:59:18.481
<v Speaker 3>They would not have probably held up in </v>
<v Speaker 3>court and the ufc had a stand down and </v>

2756
01:59:18.481 --> 01:59:22.381
<v Speaker 3>so now calmly is involved in some crazy </v>
<v Speaker 3>lawsuit with the ufc and he's a part of </v>

2757
01:59:22.381 --> 01:59:26.611
<v Speaker 3>the whole class action lawsuit thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think he was also kind of on his </v>

2758
01:59:26.611 --> 01:59:26.611
<v Speaker 3>way out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

2759
01:59:26.611 --> 01:59:29.410
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a bit of a money grabbing </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain ways.</v>

2760
01:59:30.100 --> 01:59:31.050
<v Speaker 3>But I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2761
01:59:31.390 --> 01:59:33.880
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bisping fight was,</v>

2762
01:59:34.300 --> 01:59:36.670
<v Speaker 3>it was an interesting fight because con </v>
<v Speaker 3>looked great.</v>

2763
01:59:36.700 --> 01:59:38.230
<v Speaker 3>It was ripped,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chiseled,</v>

2764
01:59:38.530 --> 01:59:41.260
<v Speaker 3>and that's why people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is going on with that guy?</v>

2765
01:59:41.720 --> 01:59:43.930
<v Speaker 3>What is he up to?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He gets these tests,</v>

2766
01:59:44.270 --> 01:59:49.270
<v Speaker 3>the results in question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the tests apparently showed very </v>

2767
01:59:49.270 --> 01:59:51.370
<v Speaker 3>high growth hormone rates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like unusually high.</v>

2768
01:59:51.440 --> 01:59:53.620
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the tests are in question,</v>

2769
01:59:54.250 --> 01:59:56.440
<v Speaker 3>I'm obviously not a doctor or a </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientist.</v>

2770
01:59:56.441 --> 01:59:57.820
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the fuck really </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened.</v>

2771
01:59:58.330 --> 02:00:02.920
<v Speaker 3>Guy looked awesome at 40 something for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the first time I ever talked to jack.</v>

2772
02:00:03.140 --> 02:00:08.140
<v Speaker 2>Pretty good transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kind of like a one one mark as when he </v>

2773
02:00:08.140 --> 02:00:08.140
<v Speaker 2>fought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pack out that.</v>

2774
02:00:08.140 --> 02:00:09.500
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2775
02:00:09.501 --> 02:00:13.070
<v Speaker 2>That was an interesting one too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same gym or something was packet.</v>

2776
02:00:13.080 --> 02:00:15.070
<v Speaker 2>I was guy packing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was old guy.</v>

2777
02:00:15.080 --> 02:00:15.570
<v Speaker 2>Alex.</v>

2778
02:00:17.460 --> 02:00:20.070
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of that going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what,</v>

2779
02:00:20.090 --> 02:00:25.090
<v Speaker 3>when you hear okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we kind of talked about this slightly </v>

2780
02:00:25.090 --> 02:00:27.471
<v Speaker 3>but you didn't touch on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a bunch of like Bobby Green </v>

2781
02:00:27.471 --> 02:00:31.640
<v Speaker 3>was accusing hockfield hassan joe's </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighters high level fighter in the ufc </v>

2782
02:00:31.741 --> 02:00:33.180
<v Speaker 3>lightweight division.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's he ranked?</v>

2783
02:00:33.181 --> 02:00:34.740
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's highly ranked.</v>

2784
02:00:34.770 --> 02:00:35.510
<v Speaker 3>Is he?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2785
02:00:35.540 --> 02:00:37.980
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if he's not 10 or top 15,</v>

2786
02:00:38.200 --> 02:00:40.080
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what rank is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll find out,</v>

2787
02:00:40.770 --> 02:00:43.280
<v Speaker 3>but he's a very good fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he,</v>

2788
02:00:43.420 --> 02:00:46.080
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's exact quotes were pedes got</v>

2789
02:00:46.110 --> 02:00:49.170
<v Speaker 3>played by a ped cheat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what he said.</v>

2790
02:00:49.860 --> 02:00:52.290
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's just speculation right?</v>

2791
02:00:52.300 --> 02:00:52.580
<v Speaker 3>Immediately.</v>

2792
02:00:52.800 --> 02:00:53.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The referral trained with,</v>

2793
02:00:54.230 --> 02:00:59.230
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one I think and I think they train </v>

2794
02:00:59.230 --> 02:01:01.411
<v Speaker 2>together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't he told me about a guy running </v>

2795
02:01:01.411 --> 02:01:02.160
<v Speaker 2>his mouth and then he came up to raphael</v>
<v Speaker 2>was all humble.</v>

2796
02:01:02.161 --> 02:01:04.130
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to train with them and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>they started training.</v>

2797
02:01:04.160 --> 02:01:06.780
<v Speaker 2>the guy was complaining,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't kick me here.</v>

2798
02:01:06.781 --> 02:01:08.490
<v Speaker 2>Don't keep me there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh reAlly?</v>

2799
02:01:08.550 --> 02:01:08.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2800
02:01:08.941 --> 02:01:10.680
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the same guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

2801
02:01:10.950 --> 02:01:12.900
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do I think about that?</v>

2802
02:01:13.220 --> 02:01:14.610
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the guy,</v>

2803
02:01:14.611 --> 02:01:17.550
<v Speaker 2>if he's not top three and he's saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>that he's probably just trying to make a</v>

2804
02:01:17.551 --> 02:01:21.960
<v Speaker 2>name for himself and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty disrespectful to rafael,</v>

2805
02:01:22.410 --> 02:01:24.780
<v Speaker 2>but it's kind of complimentary to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>LIke,</v>

2806
02:01:24.781 --> 02:01:25.540
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>

2807
02:01:25.541 --> 02:01:27.360
<v Speaker 2>It's like stuck anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's that good.</v>

2808
02:01:27.361 --> 02:01:27.960
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on,</v>

2809
02:01:27.961 --> 02:01:32.961
<v Speaker 2>sign up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See what the body does not look that </v>

2810
02:01:32.961 --> 02:01:32.961
<v Speaker 2>much different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't look.</v>

2811
02:01:32.961 --> 02:01:32.961
<v Speaker 2>If you're a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2812
02:01:32.961 --> 02:01:37.510
<v Speaker 2>if you're juicing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have traps up to your </v>

2813
02:01:37.510 --> 02:01:37.510
<v Speaker 2>ears.</v>

2814
02:01:37.510 --> 02:01:37.510
<v Speaker 2>You're going to look like a freak people</v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

2815
02:01:37.510 --> 02:01:38.990
<v Speaker 2>I always look at lance armstrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lance armstrong,</v>

2816
02:01:39.100 --> 02:01:44.100
<v Speaker 2>but he's taken epl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just take an epo and testosterone </v>

2817
02:01:44.100 --> 02:01:44.100
<v Speaker 2>and a bunch of other things as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2818
02:01:44.100 --> 02:01:48.440
<v Speaker 2>I called cocktail wrote to be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not that educated on this stuff,</v>

2819
02:01:48.441 --> 02:01:51.170
<v Speaker 2>but I'll tell you this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I've got him at 12,000,</v>

2820
02:01:51.171 --> 02:01:54.990
<v Speaker 2>500 feet altitude doing sprints,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to have.</v>

2821
02:01:55.010 --> 02:02:00.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to make damn sure he's clean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause if you're taking any kind of </v>

2822
02:02:00.010 --> 02:02:00.110
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the hell that could do</v>

2823
02:02:00.111 --> 02:02:02.720
<v Speaker 2>to your body and your blood up or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that and you want to keep</v>

2824
02:02:02.721 --> 02:02:03.260
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2825
02:02:03.261 --> 02:02:04.880
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could you imagine that?</v>

2826
02:02:04.881 --> 02:02:07.010
<v Speaker 2>And then and then you're taking 12,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>feet,</v>

2827
02:02:07.011 --> 02:02:09.170
<v Speaker 2>that's like ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bobby green or whoever you are,</v>

2828
02:02:09.740 --> 02:02:14.740
<v Speaker 2>come and go through a workout and See </v>
<v Speaker 2>what he does and then you'll see why </v>

2829
02:02:14.740 --> 02:02:14.740
<v Speaker 2>he's the best.</v>

2830
02:02:14.740 --> 02:02:17.390
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that this sport has an </v>
<v Speaker 2>issue?</v>

2831
02:02:17.391 --> 02:02:22.391
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems to at least a perception that </v>

2832
02:02:22.391 --> 02:02:23.540
<v Speaker 2>there's an issue with ped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do I think it does.</v>

2833
02:02:23.630 --> 02:02:25.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there's an issue.</v>

2834
02:02:25.730 --> 02:02:30.730
<v Speaker 2>Why do you think that exists?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think would exist because of </v>

2835
02:02:30.730 --> 02:02:31.340
<v Speaker 2>improper training or because guys want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get an edge.</v>

2836
02:02:31.850 --> 02:02:33.800
<v Speaker 2>I think that man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>joe,</v>

2837
02:02:33.870 --> 02:02:38.870
<v Speaker 2>if you and I are trying to reach for </v>
<v Speaker 2>that cup of coffee and you take </v>

2838
02:02:38.870 --> 02:02:39.530
<v Speaker 2>something and I and I know you took it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I want the coffee,</v>

2839
02:02:39.531 --> 02:02:41.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to take it to if I need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to give me a benefit.</v>

2840
02:02:42.110 --> 02:02:47.110
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's totally understandable if if one </v>

2841
02:02:47.110 --> 02:02:49.841
<v Speaker 2>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't have proper training and </v>

2842
02:02:49.841 --> 02:02:50.120
<v Speaker 2>you feel slow and you need to take some </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit to to feel stronger,</v>

2843
02:02:50.570 --> 02:02:52.700
<v Speaker 2>you're going to do it because you know </v>
<v Speaker 2>the other guys doing it.</v>

2844
02:02:53.060 --> 02:02:54.780
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mEan?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what did you.</v>

2845
02:02:54.830 --> 02:02:59.830
<v Speaker 2>What did you think about the whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>testosterone replacement therapy </v>

2846
02:02:59.830 --> 02:02:59.990
<v Speaker 2>debacle?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which I think is a real debacle.</v>

2847
02:03:00.020 --> 02:03:02.630
<v Speaker 2>I think the way they handled it was just</v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous.</v>

2848
02:03:02.631 --> 02:03:05.210
<v Speaker 2>They gave it to people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They allowed it for a few years.</v>

2849
02:03:05.540 --> 02:03:09.420
<v Speaker 2>You had these staggering perform like </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] is the poster boy for,</v>

2850
02:03:09.560 --> 02:03:14.560
<v Speaker 2>for testosterone replacement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I think if it's a medical </v>

2851
02:03:14.560 --> 02:03:15.890
<v Speaker 2>thing and like you've been to a doctor </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they say,</v>

2852
02:03:15.891 --> 02:03:16.520
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did this,</v>

2853
02:03:16.521 --> 02:03:21.521
<v Speaker 2>is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if it's regulated to the point </v>

2854
02:03:21.521 --> 02:03:22.910
<v Speaker 2>where it doesn't put you above an </v>
<v Speaker 2>average level of testosterone,</v>

2855
02:03:23.630 --> 02:03:26.210
<v Speaker 2>then I don't see what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how it should be a problem to you.</v>

2856
02:03:26.240 --> 02:03:28.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean what benefits you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gives you more quicker.</v>

2857
02:03:28.611 --> 02:03:30.710
<v Speaker 2>Recovery allows you to train harder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2858
02:03:30.711 --> 02:03:33.560
<v Speaker 2>But I'm saying as long as it's not above</v>
<v Speaker 2>an average level,</v>

2859
02:03:33.590 --> 02:03:38.590
<v Speaker 2>so if you're deficient,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say your total testosterone was </v>

2860
02:03:38.590 --> 02:03:41.270
<v Speaker 2>100 and the doctors are moderate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they're monitoring it thoroughly </v>

2861
02:03:41.270 --> 02:03:43.820
<v Speaker 2>and you show up every week and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing a test and they can show like,</v>

2862
02:03:43.821 --> 02:03:45.480
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is his thing and it's 300.</v>

2863
02:03:45.540 --> 02:03:48.530
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I don't know if that would be.</v>

2864
02:03:48.531 --> 02:03:53.531
<v Speaker 2>I'm not condoning drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm just saying maybe that would be </v>

2865
02:03:53.531 --> 02:03:54.020
<v Speaker 2>an acceptable way to let it in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you.</v>

2866
02:03:54.080 --> 02:03:57.370
<v Speaker 2>In a perfect world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's too many variables.</v>

2867
02:03:57.500 --> 02:03:59.780
<v Speaker 2>If your testosterone is low,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you probably shouldn't be a fighter.</v>

2868
02:03:59.930 --> 02:04:04.930
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also probably it's inter indicative </v>

2869
02:04:04.930 --> 02:04:07.970
<v Speaker 2>of one or two things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pituitary gland damage or,</v>

2870
02:04:08.150 --> 02:04:12.990
<v Speaker 2>or gonad damage or you took steroids and</v>
<v Speaker 2>now you're not producing.</v>

2871
02:04:12.991 --> 02:04:14.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And your body shut down.</v>

2872
02:04:14.271 --> 02:04:14.600
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2873
02:04:14.700 --> 02:04:16.340
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what a lot of guys were doing.</v>

2874
02:04:16.610 --> 02:04:18.560
<v Speaker 2>They were taking it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when you,</v>

2875
02:04:18.590 --> 02:04:21.410
<v Speaker 2>when you add in exogenous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I say it,</v>

2876
02:04:21.770 --> 02:04:24.860
<v Speaker 2>I guess I'm testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your body goes,</v>

2877
02:04:24.861 --> 02:04:26.480
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got plenty of this and it stops.</v>

2878
02:04:26.481 --> 02:04:31.481
<v Speaker 2>It's natural production.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then you would do that and then </v>

2879
02:04:31.481 --> 02:04:32.210
<v Speaker 2>go get tested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the doctor would say,</v>

2880
02:04:32.211 --> 02:04:34.100
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your natural production is way down.</v>

2881
02:04:34.130 --> 02:04:36.430
<v Speaker 2>Way down Testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2882
02:04:37.420 --> 02:04:41.460
<v Speaker 2>And that's what a lot of guys were </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting away with it.</v>

2883
02:04:41.530 --> 02:04:46.020
<v Speaker 2>You don't need it with a great diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like raphael liked the guy saying that I</v>

2884
02:04:46.021 --> 02:04:51.021
<v Speaker 2>don't know who he is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have to understand there's a </v>

2885
02:04:51.021 --> 02:04:53.940
<v Speaker 2>reason he's the champion and it starts </v>
<v Speaker 2>with his mind and his discipline and his</v>

2886
02:04:53.941 --> 02:04:56.550
<v Speaker 2>dedication to the fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He came here with nothing.</v>

2887
02:04:56.551 --> 02:04:58.550
<v Speaker 2>Did like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2888
02:04:58.710 --> 02:05:02.430
<v Speaker 2>his diet is impeccable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His training is impeccable.</v>

2889
02:05:02.460 --> 02:05:04.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he drives two hours to train with media.</v>

2890
02:05:04.410 --> 02:05:07.830
<v Speaker 2>That's dedication,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like do all the pds and what you want.</v>

2891
02:05:07.831 --> 02:05:11.280
<v Speaker 2>If you're not willing to make those </v>
<v Speaker 2>sacrifices to beat him,</v>

2892
02:05:11.281 --> 02:05:13.470
<v Speaker 2>like the same sacrifice that he makes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to beat him.</v>

2893
02:05:13.950 --> 02:05:18.950
<v Speaker 2>so when he goes down and train with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many days a week does he do this </v>

2894
02:05:18.950 --> 02:05:18.950
<v Speaker 2>for?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three to four days.</v>

2895
02:05:18.950 --> 02:05:19.670
<v Speaker 2>Three to four days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>depending upon how he's.</v>

2896
02:05:19.820 --> 02:05:21.000
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes I'll go down there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2897
02:05:21.001 --> 02:05:22.290
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or how he feels,</v>

2898
02:05:22.291 --> 02:05:23.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sparring so really hard.</v>

2899
02:05:23.641 --> 02:05:25.270
<v Speaker 2>Or he's got something in the next day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2900
02:05:25.760 --> 02:05:27.780
<v Speaker 2>that we'll take it off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

2901
02:05:27.781 --> 02:05:29.910
<v Speaker 2>I really think it's kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>disrespectful to him.</v>

2902
02:05:29.911 --> 02:05:32.160
<v Speaker 2>Did he put in so much work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many?</v>

2903
02:05:32.190 --> 02:05:34.290
<v Speaker 2>Five flights in the last year or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>

2904
02:05:34.291 --> 02:05:39.291
<v Speaker 2>but six training camps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you look at the guyS who's beaten </v>

2905
02:05:39.291 --> 02:05:41.160
<v Speaker 2>to eating some table guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2906
02:05:41.210 --> 02:05:42.810
<v Speaker 2>And towards the end we're not going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>lie.</v>

2907
02:05:42.811 --> 02:05:47.811
<v Speaker 2>It started to take its toll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking at a partial tear of the </v>

2908
02:05:47.811 --> 02:05:50.151
<v Speaker 2>mcl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was getting worn down and now he </v>

2909
02:05:50.151 --> 02:05:52.581
<v Speaker 2>really needed a break.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the other thing is the guy walks </v>

2910
02:05:52.581 --> 02:05:54.240
<v Speaker 2>around with like one 81 probably about </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] 91 93.</v>

2911
02:05:54.940 --> 02:05:56.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've seen him wiTh the weight cuts,</v>

2912
02:05:56.521 --> 02:06:00.510
<v Speaker 2>you see how holly macerated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he is the guys fighting in an aca state.</v>

2913
02:06:00.510 --> 02:06:05.510
<v Speaker 2>He's probably fighting about one 72,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe [inaudible] 73 when he fight </v>

2914
02:06:05.510 --> 02:06:09.471
<v Speaker 2>night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So imagine you take a guy who's one </v>

2915
02:06:09.471 --> 02:06:11.440
<v Speaker 2>night and strip off 20 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course he's going to look ripped and </v>

2916
02:06:11.440 --> 02:06:11.760
<v Speaker 2>lean like we all look like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>underneath,</v>

2917
02:06:11.761 --> 02:06:15.030
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So these accusations are kind of like,</v>

2918
02:06:15.230 --> 02:06:20.230
<v Speaker 2>they're very disrespectful I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But people think it because we have the </v>

2919
02:06:20.230 --> 02:06:22.110
<v Speaker 2>stamina,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stamina for sure.</v>

2920
02:06:22.140 --> 02:06:23.670
<v Speaker 2>He's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just a monster.</v>

2921
02:06:23.700 --> 02:06:24.250
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

2922
02:06:24.260 --> 02:06:27.330
<v Speaker 2>whenever you see someone who excels at a</v>
<v Speaker 2>very high level,</v>

2923
02:06:27.331 --> 02:06:28.220
<v Speaker 2>people go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hmm,</v>

2924
02:06:28.260 --> 02:06:29.670
<v Speaker 2>how's he doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do that too.</v>

2925
02:06:29.671 --> 02:06:34.671
<v Speaker 2>Like I questioned some guys too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's some guys in the ufc I </v>

2926
02:06:34.671 --> 02:06:36.810
<v Speaker 2>question and it's because their bodies </v>
<v Speaker 2>have changed a lot over time,</v>

2927
02:06:37.030 --> 02:06:38.980
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

2928
02:06:39.310 --> 02:06:41.040
<v Speaker 2>there's some guys you look At it and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2929
02:06:41.041 --> 02:06:41.820
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2930
02:06:41.840 --> 02:06:43.800
<v Speaker 2>what did hector lumbar tested positive?</v>

2931
02:06:43.890 --> 02:06:44.960
<v Speaker 2>Nobody went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

2932
02:06:46.070 --> 02:06:48.450
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't even make sense.</v>

2933
02:06:48.840 --> 02:06:50.880
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hector lumbered had muscles that weren't</v>

2934
02:06:50.881 --> 02:06:53.460
<v Speaker 2>even in books.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go like medical books and they go,</v>

2935
02:06:53.461 --> 02:06:54.720
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that.</v>

2936
02:06:54.721 --> 02:06:56.790
<v Speaker 2>ThAt is not even a human muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

2937
02:06:56.820 --> 02:06:59.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't even understand what drug he </v>
<v Speaker 2>would need to take to.</v>

2938
02:06:59.581 --> 02:07:04.581
<v Speaker 2>How like raphael,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know what drug he would </v>

2939
02:07:04.581 --> 02:07:05.790
<v Speaker 2>need to take to have great stamina.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's easily trainable.</v>

2940
02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:11.000
<v Speaker 2>The problem is all these guys are doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>such improper training that they're </v>

2941
02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:12.420
<v Speaker 2>making me look even better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

2942
02:07:12.840 --> 02:07:15.900
<v Speaker 2>So if you took a guy that had poor </v>
<v Speaker 2>stamina,</v>

2943
02:07:16.010 --> 02:07:18.570
<v Speaker 2>like okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's take bj penn.</v>

2944
02:07:19.230 --> 02:07:21.480
<v Speaker 2>Bj was on pds when he fought diego </v>
<v Speaker 2>santa.</v>

2945
02:07:21.490 --> 02:07:22.770
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

2946
02:07:22.860 --> 02:07:24.660
<v Speaker 2>Why watch this training and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well first of all,</v>

2947
02:07:24.661 --> 02:07:25.680
<v Speaker 2>beaches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of those guys.</v>

2948
02:07:25.860 --> 02:07:27.600
<v Speaker 2>That was only a few guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2949
02:07:27.601 --> 02:07:32.601
<v Speaker 2>he wouldn't even take an fucking ivy for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the frankie edgar fight and wouldn't </v>

2950
02:07:32.601 --> 02:07:32.650
<v Speaker 2>even rehydrate with an iv,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think is crazy.</v>

2951
02:07:32.650 --> 02:07:37.650
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But beach is one of those guys where I </v>

2952
02:07:37.650 --> 02:07:37.650
<v Speaker 2>don't think he's done anything ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't either.</v>

2953
02:07:37.650 --> 02:07:39.610
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he would either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do people think raphael house?</v>

2954
02:07:39.611 --> 02:07:41.410
<v Speaker 2>Because he's brazilian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2955
02:07:41.650 --> 02:07:46.650
<v Speaker 2>that's one reason.</v>

<v Speaker 2>wheaties box.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean he'S obviously done it.</v>

2966
02:08:00.660 --> 02:08:05.660
<v Speaker 2>Even if he had done any sort of ped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no fucking ped in a world that </v>

2967
02:08:05.660 --> 02:08:06.580
<v Speaker 2>makes you that good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2968
02:08:06.650 --> 02:08:09.250
<v Speaker 2>that's hard work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hard work and dedication.</v>

2969
02:08:09.280 --> 02:08:10.450
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>

2970
02:08:10.451 --> 02:08:13.150
<v Speaker 2>but they did blood and urine testing for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fight.</v>

2971
02:08:13.970 --> 02:08:14.210
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2972
02:08:14.340 --> 02:08:16.480
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I think it was three weeks out from</v>

2973
02:08:16.481 --> 02:08:17.690
<v Speaker 2>the fight like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

2974
02:08:18.100 --> 02:08:23.100
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they did urine testing after </v>

2975
02:08:23.100 --> 02:08:23.100
<v Speaker 2>urine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they can detect some stuff.</v>

2976
02:08:23.100 --> 02:08:26.731
<v Speaker 2>From what I understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm not a master of mexicans </v>

2977
02:08:26.731 --> 02:08:26.860
<v Speaker 2>supplements,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I know a little bit.</v>

2978
02:08:27.850 --> 02:08:28.720
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2979
02:08:28.930 --> 02:08:29.560
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

2980
02:08:29.620 --> 02:08:31.660
<v Speaker 2>I just keep bringing the compliments </v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2981
02:08:31.700 --> 02:08:34.560
<v Speaker 2>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you took a guide,</v>

2982
02:08:34.561 --> 02:08:37.940
<v Speaker 2>like a guy that was known for not having</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best stamina in the world,</v>

2983
02:08:37.941 --> 02:08:39.810
<v Speaker 2>the guy who fades,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2984
02:08:39.850 --> 02:08:43.420
<v Speaker 2>how much time would you need to get him </v>
<v Speaker 2>to a point where he had a fight?</v>

2985
02:08:43.480 --> 02:08:47.080
<v Speaker 2>Like say he's fighting a title fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's taking a guy who's a known.</v>

2986
02:08:47.320 --> 02:08:50.170
<v Speaker 2>Here's a good example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tyron woodley was one of the best,</v>

2987
02:08:50.171 --> 02:08:52.850
<v Speaker 2>170 pound fires and world carries a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of muscle memory.</v>

2988
02:08:52.860 --> 02:08:53.070
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2989
02:08:53.320 --> 02:08:56.170
<v Speaker 2>He'll get tyron.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's fucking huge.</v>

2990
02:08:56.171 --> 02:08:57.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing.</v>

2991
02:08:57.191 --> 02:08:59.950
<v Speaker 2>That guy makes one 70 and they're guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>yoked as fuck.</v>

2992
02:09:00.220 --> 02:09:02.320
<v Speaker 2>And when he gets in the cage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how much it weighs,</v>

2993
02:09:02.530 --> 02:09:03.980
<v Speaker 2>but it ain't one 70.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2994
02:09:03.990 --> 02:09:07.090
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's known for being very fast,</v>

2995
02:09:07.100 --> 02:09:12.100
<v Speaker 2>very strong in the first round,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but slows down a little bit in the </v>

2996
02:09:12.100 --> 02:09:12.100
<v Speaker 2>second one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2997
02:09:12.100 --> 02:09:13.240
<v Speaker 2>How much time would you need with a guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that?</v>

2998
02:09:13.241 --> 02:09:16.270
<v Speaker 2>And what would your advice be to a big </v>
<v Speaker 2>muscular guy like that?</v>

2999
02:09:16.420 --> 02:09:18.010
<v Speaker 2>Three weeks?</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably about three weeks.</v>

3000
02:09:18.011 --> 02:09:19.300
<v Speaker 2>I think that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3001
02:09:19.490 --> 02:09:21.270
<v Speaker 2>I can probably get them gone through </v>
<v Speaker 2>weeks.</v>

3002
02:09:21.460 --> 02:09:23.680
<v Speaker 2>Three weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How come you only need that much time?</v>

3003
02:09:23.980 --> 02:09:26.980
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just kind of trying to base that off</v>

3004
02:09:26.981 --> 02:09:31.981
<v Speaker 2>of like past experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd say about three weeks to get them </v>

3005
02:09:31.981 --> 02:09:31.981
<v Speaker 2>ready for about five rounds.</v>

3006
02:09:33.910 --> 02:09:35.410
<v Speaker 2>He might struggle a little in the fifth </v>
<v Speaker 2>round,</v>

3007
02:09:35.411 --> 02:09:37.180
<v Speaker 2>but you made a full training camp with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>

3008
02:09:37.181 --> 02:09:39.090
<v Speaker 2>He'll do like seven or eight rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Heart,</v>

3009
02:09:39.110 --> 02:09:40.450
<v Speaker 2>no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seven,</v>

3010
02:09:40.460 --> 02:09:42.430
<v Speaker 2>eight were not humble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is a full training camp for you?</v>

3011
02:09:42.431 --> 02:09:43.030
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you.</v>

3012
02:09:43.031 --> 02:09:48.031
<v Speaker 2>Ideally roughly eight weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you had a guy and you wanted to </v>

3013
02:09:48.031 --> 02:09:51.010
<v Speaker 2>get a guy to the best possible shape for</v>
<v Speaker 2>five rounds,</v>

3014
02:09:51.280 --> 02:09:53.740
<v Speaker 2>he say he's going to be fighting robbie </v>
<v Speaker 2>lawler for the title.</v>

3015
02:09:54.080 --> 02:09:56.530
<v Speaker 2>You've got to go five rounds through </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking hell.</v>

3016
02:09:58.090 --> 02:10:00.730
<v Speaker 2>How long would it take?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It depends who it is and again,</v>

3017
02:10:00.880 --> 02:10:03.820
<v Speaker 2>what he's had in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'd have to assess them first.</v>

3018
02:10:04.210 --> 02:10:06.730
<v Speaker 2>So if you give me a guy who's got good </v>
<v Speaker 2>cardio and he,</v>

3019
02:10:06.790 --> 02:10:11.230
<v Speaker 2>his stamina has been in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his stamina is not known for stamina.</v>

3020
02:10:11.410 --> 02:10:14.800
<v Speaker 2>He's not known for selling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could have him ready for probably like</v>

3021
02:10:14.801 --> 02:10:15.670
<v Speaker 2>four or five weeks.</v>

3022
02:10:15.880 --> 02:10:19.150
<v Speaker 2>then once you take a guy like that who's</v>
<v Speaker 2>got a lot of extra muscle,</v>

3023
02:10:19.730 --> 02:10:21.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry to interrupt,</v>

3024
02:10:21.041 --> 02:10:26.041
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he did have to prioritize that in this </v>

3025
02:10:26.041 --> 02:10:29.250
<v Speaker 2>training,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so something else might have to be </v>

3026
02:10:29.250 --> 02:10:30.010
<v Speaker 2>substituted it because training energy </v>
<v Speaker 2>systems is very taxing.</v>

3027
02:10:30.011 --> 02:10:35.011
<v Speaker 2>So let's say we're doing sprints or </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're doing something to train the </v>

3028
02:10:35.011 --> 02:10:39.071
<v Speaker 2>energy systems one day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then he might have to shorten his </v>

3029
02:10:39.071 --> 02:10:39.071
<v Speaker 2>wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did.</v>

3030
02:10:39.071 --> 02:10:39.071
<v Speaker 2>He'd have to be willing to make a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sacrifice,</v>

3031
02:10:39.071 --> 02:10:40.040
<v Speaker 2>shortened his wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

3032
02:10:40.820 --> 02:10:42.480
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to find a,</v>

3033
02:10:42.560 --> 02:10:45.530
<v Speaker 2>an even trade off where you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>compromise,</v>

3034
02:10:45.870 --> 02:10:48.410
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the aspects of the,</v>

3035
02:10:48.411 --> 02:10:50.270
<v Speaker 2>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of what the athlete needs.</v>

3036
02:10:50.540 --> 02:10:55.540
<v Speaker 2>So the skills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the skill work almost takes second </v>

3037
02:10:55.540 --> 02:10:57.440
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the guy's conditioning is bad,</v>

3038
02:10:57.441 --> 02:10:58.970
<v Speaker 2>you have to look at the athlete as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole.</v>

3039
02:10:58.971 --> 02:11:01.580
<v Speaker 2>So if the guy sucks at wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's got great stamina,</v>

3040
02:11:01.581 --> 02:11:06.581
<v Speaker 2>then you need to devote more time to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrestling or striking a fist striking </v>

3041
02:11:06.581 --> 02:11:06.710
<v Speaker 2>socks.</v>

3042
02:11:06.710 --> 02:11:08.630
<v Speaker 2>and he's good at jujitsu and he's good </v>
<v Speaker 2>at wrestling.</v>

3043
02:11:08.930 --> 02:11:13.930
<v Speaker 2>He's got no stamina.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you've got to devote your time to </v>

3044
02:11:13.930 --> 02:11:13.930
<v Speaker 2>this a little more time to the stamina </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the striking.</v>

3045
02:11:13.930 --> 02:11:15.440
<v Speaker 2>They try to build that up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>

3046
02:11:15.441 --> 02:11:20.441
<v Speaker 2>with the skill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's only so much you can do on a </v>

3047
02:11:20.441 --> 02:11:20.930
<v Speaker 2>train in one training camp that's more </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a year long process.</v>

3048
02:11:21.400 --> 02:11:26.400
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you hook you guys up with </v>

3049
02:11:26.400 --> 02:11:26.400
<v Speaker 2>nutritionists?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they don't have one?</v>

3050
02:11:26.400 --> 02:11:27.070
<v Speaker 2>Do you have someone that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't.</v>

3051
02:11:27.250 --> 02:11:30.410
<v Speaker 2>Usually they have their own guys and but</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they asked me then I'll help him,</v>

3052
02:11:30.470 --> 02:11:31.650
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

3053
02:11:31.820 --> 02:11:34.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a licensed nutritionist or </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything like that,</v>

3054
02:11:34.731 --> 02:11:39.731
<v Speaker 2>but an older they're raphael's use and </v>
<v Speaker 2>george lockhart who's getting kind of </v>

3055
02:11:39.731 --> 02:11:42.650
<v Speaker 2>popular and he's pretty happy with him </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think ricardo's using him to.</v>

3056
02:11:43.160 --> 02:11:48.160
<v Speaker 2>A lot of these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get their meals prepped way in </v>

3057
02:11:48.160 --> 02:11:48.160
<v Speaker 2>advance.</v>

3058
02:11:48.160 --> 02:11:50.590
<v Speaker 2>They get them in like little tupperware </v>
<v Speaker 2>boxes and they keep them in the fridge </v>

3059
02:11:50.590 --> 02:11:52.750
<v Speaker 2>and then heat them up before each meal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Son some girl or something like that.</v>

3060
02:11:53.280 --> 02:11:55.310
<v Speaker 2>They delivered to your house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>

3061
02:11:55.340 --> 02:12:00.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's one son foods or something like </v>

3062
02:12:00.340 --> 02:12:02.321
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can deliver and it's all athlete </v>

3063
02:12:02.321 --> 02:12:02.321
<v Speaker 2>prepared stuff they can do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can.</v>

3064
02:12:02.321 --> 02:12:04.310
<v Speaker 2>You can tell him what you want and got </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a menu or something like that.</v>

3065
02:12:04.311 --> 02:12:09.311
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's called sun foods or </v>

3066
02:12:09.311 --> 02:12:10.901
<v Speaker 2>something because I would think that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>more things you could take out of the </v>

3067
02:12:10.901 --> 02:12:13.010
<v Speaker 2>athlete's mind that they have to think </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the more happy sources they have.</v>

3068
02:12:13.290 --> 02:12:13.940
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3069
02:12:14.060 --> 02:12:15.250
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3070
02:12:18.930 --> 02:12:23.930
<v Speaker 2>How did one marina ventures when they </v>
<v Speaker 2>developed this sort of style of </v>

3071
02:12:23.930 --> 02:12:26.480
<v Speaker 2>training?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was this met with skepticism?</v>

3072
02:12:27.230 --> 02:12:28.520
<v Speaker 2>Still is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Still is.</v>

3073
02:12:28.550 --> 02:12:33.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's going to be a lot of haters on </v>

3074
02:12:33.550 --> 02:12:33.550
<v Speaker 2>the comments on youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3075
02:12:33.550 --> 02:12:33.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chance squat.</v>

3076
02:12:33.550 --> 02:12:35.030
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean you can't do a dead </v>
<v Speaker 2>lift?</v>

3077
02:12:35.031 --> 02:12:37.630
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like unless you can prove it,</v>

3078
02:12:38.760 --> 02:12:41.540
<v Speaker 2>show us that the proof in what you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying.</v>

3079
02:12:41.541 --> 02:12:43.280
<v Speaker 2>Like we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we already know the proof is out there.</v>

3080
02:12:43.281 --> 02:12:44.900
<v Speaker 2>You just have to to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

3081
02:12:44.950 --> 02:12:47.690
<v Speaker 2>to read the fine tax of the nervous </v>
<v Speaker 2>system training.</v>

3082
02:12:47.750 --> 02:12:52.750
<v Speaker 2>You know the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the records that they have on the </v>

3083
02:12:52.750 --> 02:12:52.750
<v Speaker 2>nervous system training.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3084
02:12:52.750 --> 02:12:55.190
<v Speaker 2>I think my theory is that this whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing with the weight lifting came about</v>

3085
02:12:55.191 --> 02:12:59.750
<v Speaker 2>because they needed like a universal </v>
<v Speaker 2>measurement,</v>

3086
02:12:59.810 --> 02:13:04.810
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they needed to be able to put a </v>

3087
02:13:04.810 --> 02:13:06.671
<v Speaker 2>number on improvement and so they would </v>
<v Speaker 2>use weights because it's universal so </v>

3088
02:13:07.491 --> 02:13:11.180
<v Speaker 2>that can kind of show regardless of </v>
<v Speaker 2>whether or not it's good for sports.</v>

3089
02:13:11.180 --> 02:13:13.340
<v Speaker 2>It's just showing an improvement in </v>
<v Speaker 2>strength.</v>

3090
02:13:13.820 --> 02:13:18.820
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's before they have all the fancy </v>

3091
02:13:18.820 --> 02:13:20.591
<v Speaker 2>monitors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Athletes in the us now are gravitating </v>

3092
02:13:20.591 --> 02:13:20.780
<v Speaker 2>farther and farther away from weight </v>
<v Speaker 2>lifting.</v>

3093
02:13:21.170 --> 02:13:24.050
<v Speaker 2>A lot of the football guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do it because they have to.</v>

3094
02:13:24.051 --> 02:13:29.051
<v Speaker 2>They don't like to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't like the way it makes them </v>

3095
02:13:29.051 --> 02:13:29.051
<v Speaker 2>feel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The boxers hate it.</v>

3096
02:13:29.051 --> 02:13:30.050
<v Speaker 2>Like I haven't met a boxer yet that has </v>
<v Speaker 2>told me,</v>

3097
02:13:30.051 --> 02:13:31.290
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to hit the weights.</v>

3098
02:13:31.830 --> 02:13:34.530
<v Speaker 2>They don't like it because it makes them</v>
<v Speaker 2>too stiff and it makes them to slow.</v>

3099
02:13:34.860 --> 02:13:39.860
<v Speaker 2>Marquez was lifted in a lot of weights </v>
<v Speaker 2>for their pacquiao fight when they </v>

3100
02:13:39.860 --> 02:13:40.910
<v Speaker 2>showed that 24 slash seven or whatever </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fuck hbo corner.</v>

3101
02:13:41.300 --> 02:13:43.920
<v Speaker 2>So what it is 24 slash seven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When they showed his routine,</v>

3102
02:13:43.921 --> 02:13:46.710
<v Speaker 2>I mean a lot of it was like weight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like weight lifting,</v>

3103
02:13:46.711 --> 02:13:48.000
<v Speaker 2>dumbbells,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heavy dumbbells.</v>

3104
02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:49.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty crazy.</v>

3105
02:13:49.531 --> 02:13:50.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3106
02:13:50.610 --> 02:13:53.490
<v Speaker 2>But he wasn't clean for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just.</v>

3107
02:13:53.760 --> 02:13:56.220
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just like I showed it looked like a</v>

3108
02:13:56.221 --> 02:13:58.980
<v Speaker 2>24 year old beach model man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean,</v>

3109
02:13:58.981 --> 02:14:02.180
<v Speaker 2>like 41 mexican,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3110
02:14:02.260 --> 02:14:03.360
<v Speaker 2>like been through wars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3111
02:14:03.790 --> 02:14:05.710
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you guys shut up.</v>

3112
02:14:06.200 --> 02:14:07.480
<v Speaker 2>That was ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3113
02:14:08.070 --> 02:14:09.090
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it might be.</v>

3114
02:14:09.310 --> 02:14:10.580
<v Speaker 2>That might've been a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're packed.</v>

3115
02:14:10.581 --> 02:14:13.460
<v Speaker 2>Y'all was cleaned for the first time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

3116
02:14:13.990 --> 02:14:16.500
<v Speaker 2>Well there was always a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>speculation about him as well.</v>

3117
02:14:16.560 --> 02:14:17.460
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

3118
02:14:17.480 --> 02:14:22.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he found jesus in a very deep and </v>

3119
02:14:22.480 --> 02:14:22.480
<v Speaker 2>meaningful way for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3120
02:14:22.480 --> 02:14:26.750
<v Speaker 2>And his body changed a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His body changed quite a lot of </v>

3121
02:14:27.150 --> 02:14:28.260
<v Speaker 2>divisions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It will,</v>

3122
02:14:28.310 --> 02:14:29.890
<v Speaker 2>the titles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different ways.</v>

3123
02:14:29.900 --> 02:14:31.350
<v Speaker 2>Divisions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty crazy.</v>

3124
02:14:31.380 --> 02:14:36.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And kept his knockout power all the way </v>

3125
02:14:36.380 --> 02:14:38.661
<v Speaker 2>up to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just about it actually hasn't </v>

3126
02:14:38.661 --> 02:14:38.661
<v Speaker 2>knocked anyone out though in the last </v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

3127
02:14:38.661 --> 02:14:39.180
<v Speaker 2>five yeaRs or something like that or </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3128
02:14:39.240 --> 02:14:39.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't have any many.</v>

3129
02:14:40.040 --> 02:14:41.600
<v Speaker 2>You got to be thinking about who he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting.</v>

3130
02:14:41.630 --> 02:14:45.090
<v Speaker 2>No fighting world class competition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You guys are very different.</v>

3131
02:14:45.460 --> 02:14:48.200
<v Speaker 2>Very difficult to hit me in the last big</v>
<v Speaker 2>k.</v>

3132
02:14:48.201 --> 02:14:48.930
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

3133
02:14:48.931 --> 02:14:50.130
<v Speaker 2>Ricky hatton.</v>
<v Speaker 2>YEah,</v>

3134
02:14:50.190 --> 02:14:52.320
<v Speaker 2>but he fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chris algieri.</v>

3135
02:14:52.350 --> 02:14:54.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean he knocked him down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was pretty badly hurt.</v>

3136
02:14:55.470 --> 02:14:57.720
<v Speaker 2>He looked great in that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chris algieri though.</v>

3137
02:14:57.721 --> 02:14:58.770
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got it.</v>

3138
02:14:58.771 --> 02:15:01.790
<v Speaker 2>Some balance issues and his feet and </v>
<v Speaker 2>this I can tell and it doesn't buy.</v>

3139
02:15:01.810 --> 02:15:02.920
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3140
02:15:02.930 --> 02:15:07.560
<v Speaker 2>you can tell by looking at a guy's caps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the gas,</v>

3141
02:15:07.690 --> 02:15:10.380
<v Speaker 2>the two calf muscles on the side of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other calf right there.</v>

3142
02:15:10.381 --> 02:15:11.940
<v Speaker 2>If they're really underdeveloped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guys,</v>

3143
02:15:11.941 --> 02:15:14.150
<v Speaker 2>chances are the guys got poor balance </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] let's do it.</v>

3144
02:15:14.350 --> 02:15:16.800
<v Speaker 2>Sort of fast twitch muscles that control</v>
<v Speaker 2>your balance.</v>

3145
02:15:17.250 --> 02:15:19.950
<v Speaker 2>So like packouts footwork is fricking </v>
<v Speaker 2>amazing,</v>

3146
02:15:19.960 --> 02:15:24.960
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see the size of his cast or </v>

3147
02:15:24.960 --> 02:15:24.960
<v Speaker 2>watermelons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

3148
02:15:24.960 --> 02:15:29.210
<v Speaker 2>So that plays a crucial role iN lateral </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement and footwork.</v>

3149
02:15:29.430 --> 02:15:31.710
<v Speaker 2>So he took a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You look at one more kids,</v>

3150
02:15:31.770 --> 02:15:34.740
<v Speaker 2>doesn't have great footwork,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but have you seen his kaz?</v>

3151
02:15:35.030 --> 02:15:37.380
<v Speaker 2>They're like noodles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about jon jones?</v>

3152
02:15:37.620 --> 02:15:39.550
<v Speaker 2>Jon jones is another guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's really skinny cow.</v>

3153
02:15:39.600 --> 02:15:41.610
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't have very good footwork.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's quick,</v>

3154
02:15:41.611 --> 02:15:43.950
<v Speaker 2>His upper body is quick and he's got </v>
<v Speaker 2>quick leg kicks,</v>

3155
02:15:43.951 --> 02:15:45.800
<v Speaker 2>but he doesn't have the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 2>footwork,</v>

3156
02:15:45.810 --> 02:15:46.920
<v Speaker 2>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

3157
02:15:47.100 --> 02:15:48.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

3158
02:15:48.270 --> 02:15:52.050
<v Speaker 2>Rafael has pretty good footwork now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's in and out real quick.</v>

3159
02:15:52.080 --> 02:15:54.030
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see thAt in the henderson fight?</v>

3160
02:15:54.031 --> 02:15:55.050
<v Speaker 2>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For sure.</v>

3161
02:15:55.350 --> 02:15:57.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you don't want to listen or they don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to have time for that anymore.</v>

3175
02:16:25.351 --> 02:16:27.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm done with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I did that in the beginning.</v>

3176
02:16:27.271 --> 02:16:28.920
<v Speaker 2>I did a lot of shit and had to deal with</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

02:16:28.960 --> 02:16:32.020
<v Speaker 2>Now it's like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm just,</v>

3179
02:16:33.160 --> 02:16:38.160

<v Speaker 2>treated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bj and the sec.</v>

3181
02:16:38.160 --> 02:16:39.580
<v Speaker 2>This camp with frankie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

3182
02:16:39.700 --> 02:16:40.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think,</v>

3183
02:16:40.740 --> 02:16:42.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>miriam is really cared about bj.</v>

3184
02:16:42.941 --> 02:16:43.490
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3185
02:16:43.500 --> 02:16:48.500
<v Speaker 2>it's a funny thing when you're working </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a guy that close you really get </v>

3186
02:16:48.500 --> 02:16:52.051
<v Speaker 2>attached to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You really care about their wellbeing </v>

3187
02:16:52.051 --> 02:16:52.051
<v Speaker 2>and I think they took it aS kind of like</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

3188
02:16:53.050 --> 02:16:55.660
<v Speaker 2>like an insult and kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost like a,</v>

3189
02:16:55.720 --> 02:16:56.200
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3190
02:16:57.310 --> 02:16:59.910
<v Speaker 2>almost like a stab in the back when he </v>
<v Speaker 2>questioned their,</v>

3191
02:17:00.540 --> 02:17:05.540
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their intelligence as far as training </v>

3192
02:17:05.540 --> 02:17:05.540
<v Speaker 2>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3193
02:17:05.540 --> 02:17:05.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>

3194
02:17:05.540 --> 02:17:08.731
<v Speaker 2>their programming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way they programmed the training </v>

3195
02:17:08.731 --> 02:17:08.731
<v Speaker 2>camp.</v>

3196
02:17:08.731 --> 02:17:08.890
<v Speaker 2>So I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they were hurt by that,</v>

3197
02:17:08.891 --> 02:17:10.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to this day.</v>

3198
02:17:10.211 --> 02:17:11.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gary and marv,</v>

3199
02:17:11.171 --> 02:17:12.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he talked to them,</v>

3200
02:17:12.730 --> 02:17:14.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're still saying,</v>

3201
02:17:14.681 --> 02:17:16.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just can't figure out why he,</v>

3202
02:17:16.650 --> 02:17:17.710
<v Speaker 2>he had it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

3203
02:17:17.890 --> 02:17:20.420
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he knew how he felt after the training.</v>

3204
02:17:20.421 --> 02:17:23.740
<v Speaker 2>And why would you get rid of it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why was hard,</v>

3205
02:17:24.320 --> 02:17:29.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also when you're that good and you </v>

3206
02:17:29.320 --> 02:17:29.320
<v Speaker 2>have so many.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

3207
02:17:29.320 --> 02:17:29.320
<v Speaker 2>men around you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the problem.</v>

3208
02:17:29.321 --> 02:17:32.410
<v Speaker 2>It's very hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the biggest problem I was staying</v>

3209
02:17:32.411 --> 02:17:33.340
<v Speaker 2>in Hawaii,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3210
02:17:33.460 --> 02:17:34.660
<v Speaker 2>All the hawaiians is gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hate me now,</v>

3211
02:17:35.170 --> 02:17:40.170
<v Speaker 2>but stay in Hawaii.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason why I stayed in Hawaii </v>

3212
02:17:40.170 --> 02:17:40.230
<v Speaker 2>because Hawaii is fucking awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking great.</v>

3213
02:17:40.400 --> 02:17:45.400
<v Speaker 2>Don't get me wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't just do the same training </v>

3214
02:17:45.400 --> 02:17:46.990
<v Speaker 2>partners over and over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just monotony kills athletes.</v>

3215
02:17:47.140 --> 02:17:50.680
<v Speaker 2>It does and also being the baddest </v>
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker in the room has to be.</v>

3216
02:17:50.790 --> 02:17:52.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to be challenged.</v>

3217
02:17:52.300 --> 02:17:55.450
<v Speaker 2>Even here with the root ca training when</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're at the root of training camp for</v>

3218
02:17:55.451 --> 02:17:57.830
<v Speaker 2>the diego sanchez and we had amazing </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys in there,</v>

3219
02:17:57.831 --> 02:17:59.470
<v Speaker 2>like I was in there training with them </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyday.</v>

3220
02:17:59.880 --> 02:18:04.880
<v Speaker 2>A benson henderson was in there for an </v>
<v Speaker 2>escadera who just won the ultimate </v>

3221
02:18:05.231 --> 02:18:08.680
<v Speaker 2>fighter that year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of other guys,</v>

3222
02:18:08.681 --> 02:18:11.850
<v Speaker 2>division one wrestlers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bj just tore through everybody like they</v>

3223
02:18:11.851 --> 02:18:13.780
<v Speaker 2>are nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't see one person.</v>

3224
02:18:13.781 --> 02:18:15.180
<v Speaker 2>You get the better of him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3225
02:18:15.220 --> 02:18:17.620
<v Speaker 2>Imagine a cage filled with like 15 of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these intense,</v>

3226
02:18:17.621 --> 02:18:21.100
<v Speaker 2>like hardcore lightweights and bj just </v>
<v Speaker 2>walking through all of them.</v>

3227
02:18:21.101 --> 02:18:24.340
<v Speaker 2>His timing was so precise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Elastic energy in his muscles,</v>

3228
02:18:24.341 --> 02:18:28.510
<v Speaker 2>he elastic strength that he had his </v>
<v Speaker 2>explosive power was just remarkable.</v>

3229
02:18:28.600 --> 02:18:33.600
<v Speaker 2>His take down the fence when he was at </v>
<v Speaker 2>his very best was absolutely retarded </v>

3230
02:18:33.600 --> 02:18:34.750
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'd be able to hop around on one leg.</v>

3231
02:18:35.110 --> 02:18:37.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean it just is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Flexibility is ridiculous.</v>

3232
02:18:37.540 --> 02:18:40.670
<v Speaker 2>I tried to take him down many times to </v>
<v Speaker 2>no avail.</v>

3233
02:18:40.690 --> 02:18:45.550
<v Speaker 2>Look kind of flexibility to that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have ridiculous dynamic flexibility.</v>

3234
02:18:45.700 --> 02:18:49.330
<v Speaker 2>He'd do a lot of stuff with like rubber </v>
<v Speaker 2>straps and stuff.</v>

3235
02:18:49.390 --> 02:18:52.750
<v Speaker 2>Pulling on them and resisting and </v>
<v Speaker 2>stretching this camp.</v>

3236
02:18:52.751 --> 02:18:55.270
<v Speaker 2>He was doing all the same stuff that </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically that I'm doing,</v>

3237
02:18:55.290 --> 02:19:00.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I do in my guys like the dynamic </v>

3238
02:19:00.290 --> 02:19:00.290
<v Speaker 2>stretching,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the,</v>

3239
02:19:00.290 --> 02:19:03.740
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the exercises on the stability </v>
<v Speaker 2>ball and workouts in the pool.</v>

3240
02:19:03.820 --> 02:19:07.480
<v Speaker 2>Stuff they use for rehabilitation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can progress that and use it for</v>

3241
02:19:07.481 --> 02:19:10.570
<v Speaker 2>performance as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if it's good for rehabilitation,</v>

3242
02:19:10.571 --> 02:19:12.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you take it to another level,</v>

3243
02:19:12.221 --> 02:19:17.221
<v Speaker 2>it's got to be good for performance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is your education background when </v>

3244
02:19:17.221 --> 02:19:20.971
<v Speaker 2>it comes to this stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to continuation school and high </v>

3245
02:19:20.971 --> 02:19:21.760
<v Speaker 2>school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got obsessed with weird things.</v>

3246
02:19:21.860 --> 02:19:23.440
<v Speaker 2>That's about It.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's continuation school,</v>

3247
02:19:23.441 --> 02:19:28.441
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get kicked out of high school to go </v>

3248
02:19:28.441 --> 02:19:28.441
<v Speaker 2>to like had to go to continuation</v>

3249
02:19:28.441 --> 02:19:28.670
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

3250
02:19:28.790 --> 02:19:30.270
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard that before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3251
02:19:31.130 --> 02:19:34.340
<v Speaker 2>you have an informal background training</v>
<v Speaker 2>background.</v>

3252
02:19:34.380 --> 02:19:35.300
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's funny.</v>

3253
02:19:35.820 --> 02:19:40.580
<v Speaker 2>Mark did to marv.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Marv majored in fine arts from usc.</v>

3254
02:19:40.880 --> 02:19:41.720
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3255
02:19:41.870 --> 02:19:46.870
<v Speaker 2>And that was my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was my major in junior college was </v>

3256
02:19:46.870 --> 02:19:46.870
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Arts and psychology,</v>

3257
02:19:46.870 --> 02:19:50.750
<v Speaker 1>so everything you learn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you sort of learn along the way from </v>

3258
02:19:50.750 --> 02:19:51.610
<v Speaker 1>reading studies and data.</v>

3259
02:19:51.860 --> 02:19:55.140
<v Speaker 2>Rehabilitating my own body after the car</v>
<v Speaker 2>accident that waS,</v>

3260
02:19:55.150 --> 02:20:00.150
<v Speaker 2>that was big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to supposedly the best physical </v>

3261
02:20:00.150 --> 02:20:02.891
<v Speaker 2>therapists in the area and six months </v>
<v Speaker 2>later I've got a huge bill and no </v>

3262
02:20:02.891 --> 02:20:04.570
<v Speaker 2>results so I just took it into my own </v>
<v Speaker 2>hands,</v>

3263
02:20:04.571 --> 02:20:08.330
<v Speaker 2>started researching it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I now what to do and then within a month</v>

3264
02:20:08.331 --> 02:20:10.360
<v Speaker 2>or two I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm already back at work on.</v>

3265
02:20:10.430 --> 02:20:15.430
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then how long have you been training </v>

3266
02:20:15.430 --> 02:20:15.430
<v Speaker 2>fighters now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many fighters?</v>

3267
02:20:15.430 --> 02:20:19.840
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a before I started training the </v>

3268
02:20:19.840 --> 02:20:19.840
<v Speaker 2>fighters and strictly doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>conditioning,</v>

3269
02:20:19.840 --> 02:20:23.381
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was also working with like football </v>

3270
02:20:23.381 --> 02:20:23.450
<v Speaker 2>athletes in soccer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got A ton of college athletes,</v>

3271
02:20:23.451 --> 02:20:28.451
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I can talk about them </v>

3272
02:20:28.451 --> 02:20:30.071
<v Speaker 2>because the ncaa rules or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't use them for reference from </v>

3273
02:20:30.071 --> 02:20:30.071
<v Speaker 2>promotion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

3274
02:20:30.071 --> 02:20:32.030
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some pretty high level ones,</v>

3275
02:20:32.090 --> 02:20:37.090
<v Speaker 2>a lot of high school athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but prior to that I had a jujitsu </v>

3276
02:20:37.090 --> 02:20:38.190
<v Speaker 2>academy also.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

3277
02:20:38.600 --> 02:20:43.600
<v Speaker 2>so I was always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always been in the mix with like </v>

3278
02:20:43.600 --> 02:20:43.910
<v Speaker 2>the jujitsu scene and mac,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that.</v>

3279
02:20:44.300 --> 02:20:49.300
<v Speaker 2>So then I just had so much more success </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the conditioning that I had just </v>

3280
02:20:49.300 --> 02:20:49.940
<v Speaker 2>gone that direction.</v>

3281
02:20:50.310 --> 02:20:55.310
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I like about this </v>

3282
02:20:55.310 --> 02:20:56.901
<v Speaker 1>conversation is there really is no </v>
<v Speaker 1>straight consensus about what's the </v>

3283
02:20:56.901 --> 02:21:00.630
<v Speaker 1>right way to train athletes and fighters</v>
<v Speaker 1>and especially fighters.</v>

3284
02:21:00.870 --> 02:21:04.200
<v Speaker 1>I think when it comes to strength and </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditioning fighters,</v>

3285
02:21:04.201 --> 02:21:08.460
<v Speaker 1>I think did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is probably the most varied.</v>

3286
02:21:08.580 --> 02:21:12.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think the nfl kind of has an </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of how to train football players.</v>

3287
02:21:12.650 --> 02:21:15.510
<v Speaker 1>The nba players train very similar </v>
<v Speaker 1>fashion,</v>

3288
02:21:15.511 --> 02:21:18.240
<v Speaker 1>bUt with the fighters man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's across the meanness.</v>

3289
02:21:18.670 --> 02:21:20.760
<v Speaker 1>It saw the cain velasquez,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cain velasquez,</v>

3290
02:21:20.761 --> 02:21:23.970
<v Speaker 1>that motherfucker on the planet and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>saw what he's going through.</v>

3291
02:21:24.330 --> 02:21:26.460
<v Speaker 1>And I want to see his leg extensions </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

3292
02:21:26.520 --> 02:21:31.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do pull up cain velasquez leg </v>

3293
02:21:31.520 --> 02:21:33.990
<v Speaker 1>extension 100 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just wondering how good this guy </v>

3294
02:21:33.990 --> 02:21:33.990
<v Speaker 1>could be with good training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3295
02:21:33.990 --> 02:21:34.800
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3296
02:21:34.801 --> 02:21:38.330
<v Speaker 1>he's got great wrestling training and </v>
<v Speaker 1>great kickbox training conditioning.</v>

3297
02:21:38.340 --> 02:21:41.010
<v Speaker 1>Let me say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just wondering how good he can be.</v>

3298
02:21:41.011 --> 02:21:43.370
<v Speaker 1>Like with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His fucking conditioning is.</v>

3299
02:21:44.180 --> 02:21:46.680
<v Speaker 1>his stamina is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But his speed and his</v>

3300
02:21:46.800 --> 02:21:48.060
<v Speaker 2>coordination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3301
02:21:48.090 --> 02:21:50.220
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it can be even at another level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>

3302
02:21:50.380 --> 02:21:51.720
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it's going to build up</v>

3308
02:22:14.241 --> 02:22:15.560
<v Speaker 1>his quads.</v>

3313
02:22:26.040 --> 02:22:29.490
<v Speaker 3>This is like nautilus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like jack lalaine type stuff.</v>

3314
02:22:29.520 --> 02:22:32.700
<v Speaker 3>I used to work at a place that I used to</v>
<v Speaker 3>teach people how to do that.</v>

3315
02:22:34.840 --> 02:22:39.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I worked at a place called the boston </v>

3316
02:22:39.840 --> 02:22:40.500
<v Speaker 3>athletic club in south boston to teach </v>
<v Speaker 3>people how to lift weights.</v>

3317
02:22:40.610 --> 02:22:41.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3318
02:22:41.660 --> 02:22:43.960
<v Speaker 2>so when I see that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just wonder how much better they could</v>

3319
02:22:43.990 --> 02:22:45.650
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good training.</v>

3320
02:22:45.710 --> 02:22:46.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

3321
02:22:46.230 --> 02:22:48.320
<v Speaker 2>I know it works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been around this stuff for 15,</v>

3322
02:22:48.321 --> 02:22:49.030
<v Speaker 2>20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3323
02:22:49.040 --> 02:22:52.520
<v Speaker 2>strength and conditioning and seeing </v>
<v Speaker 2>what works and it just,</v>

3324
02:22:53.570 --> 02:22:57.140
<v Speaker 2>I know it works like marv to him and his</v>
<v Speaker 2>brother combined.</v>

3325
02:22:57.141 --> 02:22:58.940
<v Speaker 2>Seventy years of experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe more.</v>

3326
02:22:59.210 --> 02:23:02.150
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's 80 now and they've seen </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

3327
02:23:02.151 --> 02:23:05.330
<v Speaker 2>Marv was one of the guys responsible for</v>
<v Speaker 2>designing the combine,</v>

3328
02:23:05.331 --> 02:23:07.370
<v Speaker 2>the football combine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3329
02:23:07.480 --> 02:23:09.650
<v Speaker 2>for about 40 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>

3330
02:23:09.800 --> 02:23:14.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's seen everything to argue with </v>

3331
02:23:14.800 --> 02:23:15.890
<v Speaker 2>him about it would be just ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're way out of your league,</v>

3332
02:23:15.920 --> 02:23:20.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like talking to helio gracie about </v>

3333
02:23:20.920 --> 02:23:22.781
<v Speaker 2>jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's nothing you're going to </v>

3334
02:23:22.781 --> 02:23:22.781
<v Speaker 2>bring to the table that he hasn't seen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3335
02:23:22.781 --> 02:23:24.980
<v Speaker 2>despite all the monstrous monster </v>
<v Speaker 2>stories that you hear.</v>

3336
02:23:24.981 --> 02:23:27.650
<v Speaker 2>Like on espn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was one of the worst sports father.</v>

3337
02:23:27.651 --> 02:23:30.290
<v Speaker 2>It's all this media did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's bullshit.</v>

3338
02:23:30.291 --> 02:23:35.120
<v Speaker 2>He's actually one of the most generous </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking guys in the training of trainers</v>

3339
02:23:35.121 --> 02:23:37.820
<v Speaker 2>that I've met.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's one of the most generous and it was</v>

3340
02:23:37.821 --> 02:23:39.680
<v Speaker 2>one of the most transparent guys I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever met.</v>

3341
02:23:40.370 --> 02:23:42.110
<v Speaker 2>Honest guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's awesome.</v>

3342
02:23:42.111 --> 02:23:43.610
<v Speaker 2>I think all about the product.</v>

3343
02:23:43.750 --> 02:23:46.990
<v Speaker 3>The problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem with the espn documentary,</v>

3344
02:23:46.991 --> 02:23:50.770
<v Speaker 3>we said his son went off the rails and </v>
<v Speaker 3>when the sun goes off the rails,</v>

3345
02:23:50.771 --> 02:23:54.160
<v Speaker 3>everybody looks for someone to blame.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know that he was too strict,</v>

3346
02:23:54.470 --> 02:23:56.680
<v Speaker 3>didn't give his son sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't even let it sunny meet,</v>

3347
02:23:56.681 --> 02:23:57.690
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3348
02:23:57.940 --> 02:23:58.840
<v Speaker 3>I think he did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3349
02:23:58.841 --> 02:24:00.780
<v Speaker 3>I don't know about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was something on the documentary.</v>

3350
02:24:00.810 --> 02:24:05.810
<v Speaker 3>They were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well it didn't let him have wheat </v>

3351
02:24:05.810 --> 02:24:05.810
<v Speaker 3>gluten.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

3352
02:24:05.810 --> 02:24:05.810
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3353
02:24:05.810 --> 02:24:07.160
<v Speaker 3>Even back then I think they were saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>meet.</v>

3354
02:24:07.200 --> 02:24:10.330
<v Speaker 3>I saw it really recently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it was certain types of meat.</v>

3355
02:24:10.420 --> 02:24:11.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I knew I was going to talk to you.</v>

3356
02:24:12.070 --> 02:24:13.660
<v Speaker 3>I think that's when I watched it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3357
02:24:14.050 --> 02:24:15.850
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

3358
02:24:15.910 --> 02:24:20.910
<v Speaker 3>it's fascinating to see a guy with that </v>
<v Speaker 3>much knowledge take a sun and turn them </v>

3359
02:24:20.910 --> 02:24:22.450
<v Speaker 3>into this fucking super freak athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3360
02:24:22.490 --> 02:24:27.280
<v Speaker 3>as in certain ways it was sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was vindicated.</v>

3361
02:24:27.700 --> 02:24:32.700
<v Speaker 3>His techniques and strategies have been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look how good is god damn son was until </v>

3362
02:24:32.700 --> 02:24:33.970
<v Speaker 3>you go crazy with the drugs and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>partying and all that stuff.</v>

3363
02:24:34.970 --> 02:24:38.110
<v Speaker 3>The idea was that the discipline was too</v>
<v Speaker 3>much and he couldn't take it anymore and</v>

3364
02:24:38.111 --> 02:24:39.730
<v Speaker 3>then he had to start it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

3365
02:24:40.340 --> 02:24:42.340
<v Speaker 2>do you want drugs?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3366
02:24:42.810 --> 02:24:45.630
<v Speaker 2>you can blame it on whatever you want </v>
<v Speaker 2>and only put the stuff into his mouth.</v>

3367
02:24:45.870 --> 02:24:46.290
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

3368
02:24:46.340 --> 02:24:47.660
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good point.</v>

3369
02:24:48.020 --> 02:24:53.020
<v Speaker 3>And you could get 10 different </v>
<v Speaker 3>personalities when you know you have a </v>

3370
02:24:53.020 --> 02:24:53.020
<v Speaker 3>son,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have more kids.</v>

3371
02:24:53.020 --> 02:24:53.870
<v Speaker 3>I have three.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're all,</v>

3372
02:24:53.900 --> 02:24:56.360
<v Speaker 3>they come out of the box completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>

3373
02:24:56.820 --> 02:24:58.760
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just worried about math.</v>

3374
02:24:58.790 --> 02:25:02.570
<v Speaker 3>Like I love my son so much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know anything different,</v>

3375
02:25:02.571 --> 02:25:03.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3376
02:25:03.171 --> 02:25:04.760
<v Speaker 3>believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have two.</v>

3377
02:25:05.060 --> 02:25:07.250
<v Speaker 3>My two youngest are completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>

3378
02:25:07.251 --> 02:25:09.650
<v Speaker 3>I love them equally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're totally different,</v>

3379
02:25:09.950 --> 02:25:11.720
<v Speaker 3>but there they have their own little </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing going on.</v>

3380
02:25:11.721 --> 02:25:15.950
<v Speaker 3>But the point being that it's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>different children,</v>

3381
02:25:15.951 --> 02:25:20.951
<v Speaker 3>different humans will react differently </v>
<v Speaker 3>to different forms of diversity that </v>

3382
02:25:20.951 --> 02:25:22.610
<v Speaker 3>they face and there's only so much you </v>
<v Speaker 3>could do as a parent,</v>

3383
02:25:22.670 --> 02:25:24.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't really</v>

3384
02:25:24.100 --> 02:25:28.180
<v Speaker 1>totally protect them and shield them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it seemed like his son has come back</v>

3385
02:25:28.181 --> 02:25:30.130
<v Speaker 1>from all that stuff and he's okay now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3386
02:25:30.160 --> 02:25:32.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But just as an artist man,</v>

3387
02:25:32.630 --> 02:25:35.230
<v Speaker 1>his arts pretty bitch until now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess he's living up in Oregon,</v>

3388
02:25:35.231 --> 02:25:36.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really know todd very well,</v>

3389
02:25:36.701 --> 02:25:39.040
<v Speaker 1>but I've actually never even met todd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

3390
02:25:39.460 --> 02:25:40.570
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3391
02:25:40.571 --> 02:25:42.940
<v Speaker 1>I guess he's living up in Oregon and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got some killer art man.</v>

3392
02:25:43.210 --> 02:25:47.400
<v Speaker 1>And there's also the reality that when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you push your son or your daughter,</v>

3393
02:25:47.410 --> 02:25:49.180
<v Speaker 1>anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any human being,</v>

3394
02:25:49.480 --> 02:25:52.240
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have a resistance to some of that</v>

3395
02:25:52.241 --> 02:25:54.520
<v Speaker 1>shit and they don't want to do what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want them to do.</v>

3396
02:25:54.760 --> 02:25:56.680
<v Speaker 1>And they developed a distaste for </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

3397
02:25:56.681 --> 02:25:59.740
<v Speaker 1>even something that they're really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really talented at.</v>

3398
02:25:59.741 --> 02:26:01.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's possible as well.</v>

3399
02:26:01.781 --> 02:26:02.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3400
02:26:02.591 --> 02:26:07.591
<v Speaker 1>you know what the funny thIng is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you ever read that story about his </v>

3401
02:26:07.591 --> 02:26:10.450
<v Speaker 1>son run into like a tenncare something </v>
<v Speaker 1>when he was four years old?</v>

3402
02:26:10.510 --> 02:26:15.510
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't really like an eight minute </v>

3403
02:26:15.510 --> 02:26:15.510
<v Speaker 1>mile or something when he's four years </v>
<v Speaker 1>old.</v>

3404
02:26:15.510 --> 02:26:16.870
<v Speaker 1>And I asked them about that one day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

3405
02:26:16.871 --> 02:26:18.410
<v Speaker 1>mom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell is that like,</v>

3406
02:26:18.430 --> 02:26:20.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like an eight minute mile.</v>

3407
02:26:20.351 --> 02:26:21.420
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so yeah.</v>

3408
02:26:21.421 --> 02:26:22.450
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't figure out.</v>

3409
02:26:22.451 --> 02:26:24.610
<v Speaker 1>Nick is why everybody thinks I made him </v>
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

3410
02:26:26.110 --> 02:26:28.790
<v Speaker 1>I didn't make him do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what he said he wanted to do it.</v>

3411
02:26:29.320 --> 02:26:31.570
<v Speaker 1>So he had that drive and that intensity </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

3412
02:26:32.530 --> 02:26:37.530
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's kinda like shed some light on </v>

3413
02:26:37.530 --> 02:26:37.530
<v Speaker 1>some things right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3414
02:26:37.810 --> 02:26:38.800
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3415
02:26:38.920 --> 02:26:41.350
<v Speaker 1>whenever someone comes out in a weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

3416
02:26:41.480 --> 02:26:46.480
<v Speaker 1>you use a lot of people are trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>point blame and a lot of different </v>

3417
02:26:46.480 --> 02:26:46.480
<v Speaker 1>areas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's the fram,</v>

3418
02:26:46.480 --> 02:26:51.150
<v Speaker 1>the friends of the family or the seemed </v>
<v Speaker 1>like just college coaches had a real </v>

3419
02:26:51.150 --> 02:26:51.150
<v Speaker 1>issue with him as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3420
02:26:51.150 --> 02:26:52.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Put them in a box.</v>

3421
02:26:52.660 --> 02:26:54.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a.</v>

3422
02:26:55.810 --> 02:26:58.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he kind of took over and worked</v>

3423
02:26:59.400 --> 02:27:04.400
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was made the coach look foolish and </v>

3424
02:27:04.400 --> 02:27:04.400
<v Speaker 1>they didn't like that either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3425
02:27:04.400 --> 02:27:05.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the name of that documentary?</v>

3426
02:27:05.820 --> 02:27:09.520
<v Speaker 1>But he wants to watch it like a 30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30,</v>

3427
02:27:09.521 --> 02:27:12.100
<v Speaker 1>and 30 or some of the project.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't that it?</v>

3428
02:27:12.340 --> 02:27:17.340
<v Speaker 1>I think that was at a mars in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning talking about he's an </v>

3429
02:27:17.340 --> 02:27:18.610
<v Speaker 1>undefeated wrestler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>undefeated boxer.</v>

3430
02:27:18.850 --> 02:27:23.850
<v Speaker 1>That's great man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people don't know that about </v>

3431
02:27:23.850 --> 02:27:23.850
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a football player too,</v>

3432
02:27:23.850 --> 02:27:24.700
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3433
02:27:24.701 --> 02:27:29.701
<v Speaker 1>but he was also an undefeated boxer and </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestler through the army and college </v>

3434
02:27:29.701 --> 02:27:29.701
<v Speaker 1>and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And his,</v>

3435
02:27:29.701 --> 02:27:34.321
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his fascination with training athletes </v>

3436
02:27:34.321 --> 02:27:34.321
<v Speaker 1>was more powerful than his fascination </v>
<v Speaker 1>with competing.</v>

3437
02:27:34.330 --> 02:27:35.290
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wAs.</v>

<v Speaker 1>weightlifting and he felt the destroyed </v>

3439
02:27:40.291 --> 02:27:44.881
<v Speaker 1>his athleticism once he went to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>raiders and he was competing with the </v>

<v Speaker 1>worse.</v>

3442
02:27:49.800 --> 02:27:54.800

3443
02:27:54.800 --> 02:27:54.800
<v Speaker 1>destroyed his professional career.</v>
