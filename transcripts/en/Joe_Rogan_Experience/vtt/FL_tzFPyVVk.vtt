00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.863
<v Speaker 1>Struggle,</v>

2
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.820
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ladies and gentlemen would live the</v>

3
00:00:09.821 --> 00:00:12.850
<v Speaker 2>presidents now blind spend staring at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sun all day trying to see the</v>

4
00:00:12.851 --> 00:00:14.290
<v Speaker 2>eclipse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's photos of it.</v>

5
00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:16.740
<v Speaker 2>Mike Baker help us out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

6
00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.100
<v Speaker 2>What are we doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man?</v>

7
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:19.270
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dahlia,</v>

8
00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:20.470
<v Speaker 2>that's probably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

9
00:00:20.471 --> 00:00:20.941
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

10
00:00:20.941 --> 00:00:24.790
<v Speaker 2>it's an indication that they don't have</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of discipline in that</v>

11
00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:25.421
<v Speaker 2>Communications Department of the White</v>
<v Speaker 2>House.</v>

12
00:00:25.421 --> 00:00:27.220
<v Speaker 2>No one got him the message,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't Sir Sir.</v>

13
00:00:27.221 --> 00:00:28.930
<v Speaker 2>Don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't look at the sun.</v>

14
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.970
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely don't look at the sun while</v>

15
00:00:30.971 --> 00:00:33.730
<v Speaker 2>people are looking at you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ,</v>

16
00:00:33.731 --> 00:00:36.810
<v Speaker 2>the whole world is going to mock you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't you know that everybody knows is</v>

17
00:00:36.811 --> 00:00:37.930
<v Speaker 2>since they were a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

18
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.120
<v Speaker 2>Even even if you've never been involved</v>
<v Speaker 2>in an eclipse,</v>

19
00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.460
<v Speaker 2>every kid knows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't look at the sun.</v>

20
00:00:42.461 --> 00:00:45.460
<v Speaker 2>It's the one thing that every child</v>
<v Speaker 2>learned somehow.</v>

21
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.420
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I tried to do that,</v>

22
00:00:46.421 --> 00:00:49.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm a fucking idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I took a two dark sunglasses.</v>

23
00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.510
<v Speaker 2>I put them on top of each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That'll where I put one pair and then I</v>

24
00:00:52.511 --> 00:00:54.820
<v Speaker 2>put another layer over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't work folks.</v>

25
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.860
<v Speaker 2>It looks good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does look good,</v>

26
00:00:56.861 --> 00:00:58.440
<v Speaker 2>but I only looked for a second and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>went,</v>

27
00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:59.170
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

28
00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.120
<v Speaker 2>this doesn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know where I could look at it.</v>

29
00:01:01.121 --> 00:01:03.550
<v Speaker 2>I can look at it through my pool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the reflection.</v>

30
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.260
<v Speaker 2>Oh sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll see the eclipse,</v>

31
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.050
<v Speaker 2>but it never really got fully dark here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

32
00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.150
<v Speaker 2>we're too low.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

33
00:01:09.151 --> 00:01:10.180
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just came down from,</v>

34
00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.470
<v Speaker 2>from Idaho.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was up there in the mountains over the</v>

35
00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.890
<v Speaker 2>past few days and it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it did just hippies coming in from left</v>

36
00:01:17.891 --> 00:01:21.490
<v Speaker 2>and right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tire state just overrun with the hippies</v>

37
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.350
<v Speaker 2>and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean their parking and people's,</v>

38
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:24.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ranches,</v>

39
00:01:24.371 --> 00:01:28.880
<v Speaker 2>they just driving up on fields that have</v>
<v Speaker 2>just been planted there just like they</v>

40
00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.890
<v Speaker 2>don't even think.</v>

41
00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.350
<v Speaker 2>And so they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they kept my.</v>

42
00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.871
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

43
00:01:31.871 --> 00:01:34.720
<v Speaker 2>hey God bless him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that I was intellectually</v>

44
00:01:34.721 --> 00:01:37.660
<v Speaker 2>curious enough to really worry about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>eclipse.</v>

45
00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.940
<v Speaker 2>There's a balance in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

46
00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.410
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of intellectual curiosity</v>
<v Speaker 2>is great and a lot of hippie values are</v>

47
00:01:44.411 --> 00:01:46.870
<v Speaker 2>great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you go too far into the hippie</v>

48
00:01:46.871 --> 00:01:51.871
<v Speaker 2>retard gene pool and you get these dopey</v>
<v Speaker 2>hippies that are hippies that know</v>

49
00:01:52.251 --> 00:01:55.690
<v Speaker 2>they're the worst kind of hippies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hippies that don't really want to do any</v>

50
00:01:55.691 --> 00:01:58.380
<v Speaker 2>work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they want universal basic income.</v>

51
00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.180
<v Speaker 2>They want all of these.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These one percenters,</v>

52
00:02:01.181 --> 00:02:05.500
<v Speaker 2>they have plenty of money so that no one</v>
<v Speaker 2>should have to work ever.</v>

53
00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.130
<v Speaker 2>They just passed it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They passed a tax up in Seattle.</v>

54
00:02:09.131 --> 00:02:10.930
<v Speaker 2>It's gonna probably going to get struck</v>
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>

55
00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:12.340
<v Speaker 2>but it basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was up in Seattle,</v>

56
00:02:12.341 --> 00:02:13.360
<v Speaker 2>will got blessed them up there.</v>

57
00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.210
<v Speaker 2>They they've decided that they're going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go against the state charter,</v>

58
00:02:16.211 --> 00:02:18.930
<v Speaker 2>which says you can't have a attacks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

59
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.810
<v Speaker 2>An income tax,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they've gone ahead and done it for</v>

60
00:02:22.811 --> 00:02:26.170
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's for the top two percent.</v>

61
00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.160
<v Speaker 2>The only tax that tax.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The tax people are doing something right</v>

62
00:02:30.161 --> 00:02:32.380
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotta make this thing more</v>

63
00:02:32.381 --> 00:02:33.940
<v Speaker 2>equitable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>

64
00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:35.470
<v Speaker 2>That's really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

65
00:02:35.471 --> 00:02:37.930
<v Speaker 2>what's interesting is that's the whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>reason why a lot of companies like</v>

66
00:02:37.931 --> 00:02:41.380
<v Speaker 2>Amazon and Microsoft is the reason why</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've located to Seattle.</v>

67
00:02:41.381 --> 00:02:44.860
<v Speaker 2>You fucking stomachs and they're going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to pull out and then you wouldn't have</v>

68
00:02:44.861 --> 00:02:49.861
<v Speaker 2>any jobs and then you'll be poor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody is going to pay for that.</v>

69
00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We came from,</v>

70
00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.790
<v Speaker 2>we moved out from fairfield county,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from New Canaan,</v>

71
00:02:54.791 --> 00:02:58.590
<v Speaker 2>Connecticut when we moved out to Idaho,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was the world's greatest movie of</v>

72
00:02:58.591 --> 00:02:59.950
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Connecticut.</v>

73
00:02:59.951 --> 00:03:00.370
<v Speaker 2>Sucks.</v>

74
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.940
<v Speaker 3>I say it over and over again and.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

75
00:03:03.941 --> 00:03:04.940
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they know it.</v>

76
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.770
<v Speaker 3>You better get Noah and then people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you live in a lucky spot and.</v>

77
00:03:08.771 --> 00:03:09.381
<v Speaker 3>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

78
00:03:09.381 --> 00:03:11.190
<v Speaker 3>their plan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

79
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.290
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the plan of the governor and the rest of</v>

80
00:03:14.291 --> 00:03:17.710
<v Speaker 3>the crew there is when you need more</v>
<v Speaker 3>money tax,</v>

81
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.260
<v Speaker 3>fairfield county where I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is home to new Canaan and</v>

82
00:03:20.261 --> 00:03:24.580
<v Speaker 3>Greenwich and Darien and Stanford.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The people that work in the city or the</v>

83
00:03:24.581 --> 00:03:27.040
<v Speaker 3>people that are working in finance and</v>
<v Speaker 3>now what they've,</v>

84
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.800
<v Speaker 3>what they've had over the past three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>four years.</v>

85
00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.930
<v Speaker 3>Ever since the governor's been running</v>
<v Speaker 3>the shop is people moving out.</v>

86
00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.440
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every GE moved out of General Electric,</v>

87
00:03:38.441 --> 00:03:41.650
<v Speaker 3>the entire operation with General</v>
<v Speaker 3>Electric said went to the state and</v>

88
00:03:41.651 --> 00:03:42.730
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know people will think of why are we</v>

89
00:03:42.731 --> 00:03:45.340
<v Speaker 3>talking about this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they went to the State House and</v>

90
00:03:45.341 --> 00:03:47.050
<v Speaker 3>they said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't keep doing this.</v>

91
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.680
<v Speaker 3>You can't keep jacking it up on us to</v>
<v Speaker 3>pay for everything.</v>

92
00:03:50.681 --> 00:03:52.780
<v Speaker 3>We're happy to pay and we are apparent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our fair share.</v>

93
00:03:52.781 --> 00:03:54.520
<v Speaker 3>But so they did that in general.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you said,</v>

94
00:03:54.521 --> 00:03:55.970
<v Speaker 3>we're going to move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The state didn't believe him.</v>

95
00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.450
<v Speaker 3>They've all relocated to Boston.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

96
00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.610
<v Speaker 3>they've got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

97
00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.030
<v Speaker 3>who else is moving to Aetna?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the,</v>

98
00:04:02.031 --> 00:04:03.310
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the large insurance company,</v>

99
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now Connecticut's known as sort of the</v>

100
00:04:05.081 --> 00:04:06.040
<v Speaker 3>insurance capital,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

101
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.760
<v Speaker 3>They're leaving hedge funds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>private equity groups moving down to</v>

102
00:04:09.761 --> 00:04:11.620
<v Speaker 3>Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>

103
00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.500
<v Speaker 3>great pay your fair share,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at a certain point</v>

104
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:20.350
<v Speaker 3>everybody's got to contribute something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't just say that's what you're</v>

105
00:04:20.351 --> 00:04:21.970
<v Speaker 3>gonna do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm not in the one percent.</v>

106
00:04:21.971 --> 00:04:23.770
<v Speaker 3>I wish I was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It used to be when you were a kid,</v>

107
00:04:23.771 --> 00:04:26.300
<v Speaker 3>you wanted to be rich right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

108
00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.210
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what people want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want to be in the middle.</v>

109
00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.610
<v Speaker 3>You want to be comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where you want to be comfortable.</v>

110
00:04:30.611 --> 00:04:31.444
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

111
00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.230
<v Speaker 3>I always thought it'd be pretty cool to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be wealthy and all and,</v>

112
00:04:34.231 --> 00:04:35.470
<v Speaker 3>and I think I'd be pretty good at it.</v>

113
00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:38.730
<v Speaker 4>My friend Brian Cowen said it best once</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it stuck with me forever.</v>

114
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.350
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what you want to be.</v>

115
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.140
<v Speaker 4>You want to be to the point where you</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't have to worry about your bills and</v>

116
00:04:43.141 --> 00:04:45.900
<v Speaker 4>you can go to a restaurant and not worry</v>
<v Speaker 4>about what you order.</v>

117
00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:47.640
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything other than that,</v>

118
00:04:47.641 --> 00:04:48.340
<v Speaker 4>it's bullshit.</v>

119
00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:49.031
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because everybody,</v>

120
00:04:49.031 --> 00:04:49.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's,</v>

121
00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:50.950
<v Speaker 3>that's a good point I guess because</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

122
00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.770
<v Speaker 3>you take that stress out of your life</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I get,</v>

123
00:04:53.771 --> 00:04:55.630
<v Speaker 3>well I guess you're gonna worry about</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

124
00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.330
<v Speaker 4>So people find it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

125
00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.380
<v Speaker 4>Just stress and stress,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

126
00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.770
<v Speaker 4>I mean like look at these assholes that</v>
<v Speaker 4>buy these $500,000,000 yachts.</v>

127
00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.720
<v Speaker 4>It's like they just realized like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

128
00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.930
<v Speaker 4>enough problems in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I need to buy a fucking floating city.</v>

129
00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.160
<v Speaker 4>And then I got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to hire a crew of 100 to hate me,</v>

130
00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.920
<v Speaker 4>talk shit about me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Every time I turned my back they,</v>

131
00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.050
<v Speaker 4>I want to fuck my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dammit.</v>

132
00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:20.770
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to get in line.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bosens made finished.</v>

133
00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:22.450
<v Speaker 4>Compost is made.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know what I came up with.</v>

134
00:05:22.451 --> 00:05:23.560
<v Speaker 4>Bows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And is that a real thing?</v>

135
00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:24.610
<v Speaker 4>I think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

136
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.550
<v Speaker 4>I think there was such thing as a</v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] made this always like this</v>

137
00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:28.960
<v Speaker 4>ebb and flow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

138
00:05:28.961 --> 00:05:32.710
<v Speaker 4>I mean the people that have accumulated</v>
<v Speaker 4>too much wealth,</v>

139
00:05:32.711 --> 00:05:35.590
<v Speaker 4>especially when it comes to like hedge</v>
<v Speaker 4>fund people and finance people.</v>

140
00:05:35.591 --> 00:05:37.570
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are you actually doing?</v>

141
00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.940
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you're using that money to influence</v>

142
00:05:39.941 --> 00:05:43.810
<v Speaker 4>policy and that policy allows you to</v>
<v Speaker 4>extract more money from the system and</v>

143
00:05:43.811 --> 00:05:46.720
<v Speaker 4>it gets real slippery because</v>
<v Speaker 4>occasionally you guys fuck up and it</v>

144
00:05:46.721 --> 00:05:48.580
<v Speaker 4>crashes the whole economy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

145
00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:50.740
<v Speaker 4>Like that kind of money is like really</v>
<v Speaker 4>creepy.</v>

146
00:05:50.741 --> 00:05:53.620
<v Speaker 4>But when you're talking about someone</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's developed a legitimate product,</v>

147
00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:55.690
<v Speaker 4>they sell it and they're successful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they work hard.</v>

148
00:05:55.691 --> 00:05:57.730
<v Speaker 4>They made something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some does business.</v>

149
00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:58.310
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

150
00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:58.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

151
00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:01.330
<v Speaker 2>The hiring people there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know there's a,</v>

152
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:04.070
<v Speaker 2>there's a house for sale up in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hamptons,</v>

153
00:06:04.071 --> 00:06:06.950
<v Speaker 2>now there's a house for $175.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Million Dollars.</v>

154
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:08.160
<v Speaker 2>It seems logical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

155
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.250
<v Speaker 2>One hundred and $75,000,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know what?</v>

156
00:06:10.251 --> 00:06:11.590
<v Speaker 2>It's on the beach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

157
00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.600
<v Speaker 2>it's got waterfront to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I guess that explains the Price Tag.</v>

158
00:06:14.601 --> 00:06:16.070
<v Speaker 2>But here's the thing about that water</v>
<v Speaker 2>fund.</v>

159
00:06:16.071 --> 00:06:17.930
<v Speaker 2>Anybody can walk in front of your house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

160
00:06:17.931 --> 00:06:20.330
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a huge problem in Malibu.</v>

161
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.300
<v Speaker 2>There's this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple of other I'm friends with and</v>

162
00:06:23.301 --> 00:06:26.540
<v Speaker 2>their sons surf and they live in Malibu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have a house in Malibu and they</v>

163
00:06:26.541 --> 00:06:28.460
<v Speaker 2>were surfing in the water in front of</v>
<v Speaker 2>this house.</v>

164
00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.010
<v Speaker 2>This guy comes out and yells and screams</v>
<v Speaker 2>at him,</v>

165
00:06:31.011 --> 00:06:32.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get the fuck off the beach because you</v>

166
00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:35.030
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a $10,000,000 house right there on the</v>

167
00:06:35.031 --> 00:06:36.320
<v Speaker 2>beach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>

168
00:06:36.321 --> 00:06:37.130
<v Speaker 2>what are you talking about?</v>

169
00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:38.960
<v Speaker 2>Like we live right over there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You piece of shit.</v>

170
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.720
<v Speaker 2>And like not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody can be on this beach.</v>

171
00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:43.250
<v Speaker 2>This is the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't,</v>

172
00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:47.690
<v Speaker 2>you don't own the private beach signs up</v>
<v Speaker 2>and ate it and for the most part that's</v>

173
00:06:47.691 --> 00:06:48.950
<v Speaker 2>true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Up and the Hamilton,</v>

174
00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:50.990
<v Speaker 2>I think this actually has some private</v>
<v Speaker 2>beach frontage,</v>

175
00:06:50.991 --> 00:06:54.080
<v Speaker 2>which again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so $175 million seems somewhat</v>

176
00:06:54.081 --> 00:06:56.540
<v Speaker 2>reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hampton's most expensive home.</v>

177
00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.560
<v Speaker 2>There it is right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hundred and $75.</v>

178
00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.380
<v Speaker 2>Got a lake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a.</v>

179
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.490
<v Speaker 2>he's got a lake and then further past</v>
<v Speaker 2>the leg.</v>

180
00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:06.350
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They all have lakes.</v>

181
00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:09.500
<v Speaker 2>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that freshwater or brackish water?</v>

182
00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:10.910
<v Speaker 2>That must be brackish water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

183
00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.670
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess a pretty bad ass don't have fish</v>

184
00:07:13.671 --> 00:07:16.550
<v Speaker 2>in your front yard like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if the kitchen appliances</v>

185
00:07:16.551 --> 00:07:19.790
<v Speaker 2>convey how big is this house?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that.</v>

186
00:07:19.791 --> 00:07:21.770
<v Speaker 2>Wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That overhead view was the entire</v>

187
00:07:21.771 --> 00:07:23.960
<v Speaker 2>property baller.</v>

188
00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:27.410
<v Speaker 2>You know what though?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But look at that picture though.</v>

189
00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:30.250
<v Speaker 2>Does that look like $175?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Million dollars in your mind when you</v>

190
00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.560
<v Speaker 2>think the whole fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She'd be plated in gold.</v>

191
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:35.380
<v Speaker 2>Forty two acres.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

192
00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:36.081
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>

193
00:07:36.081 --> 00:07:37.190
<v Speaker 2>That's what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what it is.</v>

194
00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:38.720
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Ford family.</v>

195
00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:41.170
<v Speaker 2>Oh Ah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

<v Speaker 2>So hashtag balling on Mustang if you</v>

197
00:07:45.561 --> 00:07:46.430

<v Speaker 2>I think you're right,</v>

198
00:07:46.431 --> 00:07:50.900
<v Speaker 2>if you get to that point where you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>entertain the idea of maybe I'll put 10</v>

199
00:07:50.901 --> 00:07:52.880
<v Speaker 2>percent down and then I'll take the rest</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the mortgage.</v>

200
00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:54.470
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then yeah,</v>

201
00:07:54.471 --> 00:07:57.860
<v Speaker 2>you've probably got too much money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He reminds me of that scene in the big</v>

202
00:07:57.861 --> 00:08:01.730
<v Speaker 2>Lebowski when you meet the big Lebowski</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's in the wheelchair and his</v>

203
00:08:01.731 --> 00:08:04.130
<v Speaker 2>wife's off from the suck dude's Dick for</v>
<v Speaker 2>a thousand bucks.</v>

204

<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

205

208
00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:14.240
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to use that movie to judge</v>

209
00:08:14.241 --> 00:08:15.980
<v Speaker 2>whether or not I enjoyed people's</v>
<v Speaker 2>opinions.</v>

210
00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:18.550
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tell me anything about the big Lebowski.</v>

211
00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:22.550
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talked to a lot of people.</v>

212
00:08:22.551 --> 00:08:24.950
<v Speaker 2>They said I couldn't make it through the</v>
<v Speaker 2>first hour and I'm thinking,</v>

213

<v Speaker 2>How do you not find this funny?</v>

<v Speaker 2>away,</v>

216
00:08:33.201 --> 00:08:34.130

<v Speaker 2>be honest with you,</v>

234
00:09:09.421 --> 00:09:11.520
<v Speaker 2>if the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the fish aren't biting,</v>

235
00:09:11.521 --> 00:09:12.800
<v Speaker 2>then we just go hiking.</v>

236
00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:15.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to take my boy will be a first</v>
<v Speaker 2>time for him to go up there and it's</v>

237
00:09:15.751 --> 00:09:16.860
<v Speaker 2>going to be great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got.</v>

238
00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:21.870
<v Speaker 2>But I've just now emptied the freezer of</v>
<v Speaker 2>a salmon and halibut and rock fish from</v>

239
00:09:22.141 --> 00:09:24.300
<v Speaker 2>the last trip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's time to stock up again,</v>

240
00:09:24.301 --> 00:09:26.940
<v Speaker 2>but it's just a great time of year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that a great thing?</v>

241
00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:29.670
<v Speaker 2>To have fish that you caught in your</v>
<v Speaker 2>freezer,</v>

242
00:09:29.671 --> 00:09:31.480
<v Speaker 2>they can go back to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

243
00:09:31.481 --> 00:09:34.710
<v Speaker 2>it was only like an hour old by the time</v>
<v Speaker 2>you threw it on the ice.</v>

244
00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:36.300
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fantastic.</v>

245
00:09:36.301 --> 00:09:38.710
<v Speaker 2>And so if and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just also just getting up there,</v>

246
00:09:38.711 --> 00:09:41.400
<v Speaker 2>if people have been up to Alaska to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>up there and see it before it melts.</v>

247
00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:45.620
<v Speaker 2>I said that I think it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll be fine.</v>

248
00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:47.150
<v Speaker 2>Are you worried about it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

249
00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:50.130
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not in the sense that Oh my God,</v>

250
00:09:50.131 --> 00:09:52.380
<v Speaker 2>if I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I don't quit driving my wagon here,</v>

251
00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.630
<v Speaker 2>the glaciers are going to all melt away.</v>

252
00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:55.320
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

253
00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure we have some impact and it's</v>

254
00:09:57.631 --> 00:09:58.590
<v Speaker 2>like everything else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

255
00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:01.070
<v Speaker 2>The truth is in the middle somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

256
00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:04.980
<v Speaker 2>So I'm sure we should all do our part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but do I think we're all gonna you know,</v>

257
00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:08.250
<v Speaker 2>the polar bears are dying off tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

258
00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:11.550
<v Speaker 2>but well there's definitely somebody</v>
<v Speaker 2>with their ideas.</v>

259
00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:13.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's definitely some issues with</v>

260
00:10:13.201 --> 00:10:17.130
<v Speaker 2>polar bears in areas that have less ice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but apparently the polar bear</v>

261
00:10:17.131 --> 00:10:19.470
<v Speaker 2>population.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is something that I've read about</v>

262
00:10:19.471 --> 00:10:21.240
<v Speaker 2>Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least in Canada,</v>

263
00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:24.180
<v Speaker 2>the polar bear population is higher than</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been in years.</v>

264
00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:27.360
<v Speaker 2>Now there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's not a shortage of polar bears,</v>

265
00:10:27.361 --> 00:10:31.440
<v Speaker 2>but if you go over there to like they</v>
<v Speaker 2>have hunts for polar bears,</v>

266
00:10:31.441 --> 00:10:34.630
<v Speaker 2>like they pay people to take them on</v>
<v Speaker 2>polar bear hunts,</v>

267
00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:38.190
<v Speaker 2>but then you can't bring the polar bear</v>
<v Speaker 2>back to the United States so you can</v>

268
00:10:38.191 --> 00:10:39.420
<v Speaker 2>keep it in Canada.</v>

269
00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:42.790
<v Speaker 2>You can like if you come from Europe and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to hunt a polar bear,</v>

270
00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:44.010
<v Speaker 2>you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all very.</v>

271
00:10:44.011 --> 00:10:46.140
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You mentioned trying to pack a polar</v>

272
00:10:46.141 --> 00:10:49.380
<v Speaker 2>bear back into the states to know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just shot that.</v>

273
00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.630
<v Speaker 2>You can see what the reaction would be</v>
<v Speaker 2>a.</v>

274
00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:55.830
<v Speaker 2>I think it's yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody should do their part,</v>

275
00:10:55.831 --> 00:10:57.060
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no doubt about that.</v>

276
00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:58.690
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't be a Douche and.</v>

277
00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:01.920
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is in part it's like</v>
<v Speaker 2>both sides,</v>

278
00:11:01.921 --> 00:11:03.990
<v Speaker 2>they latch onto one piece of</v>
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>

279
00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:05.430
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like what you just said,</v>

280
00:11:05.431 --> 00:11:07.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the polar bear population to grow so</v>

281
00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:09.540
<v Speaker 2>that once I will latch onto and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>

282
00:11:09.541 --> 00:11:12.480
<v Speaker 2>there's no such thing as climate change</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the other side we'll find one piece</v>

283
00:11:12.481 --> 00:11:13.920
<v Speaker 2>of it and they'll latch onto that and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>

284
00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:15.600
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like I said,</v>

285
00:11:15.601 --> 00:11:17.310
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big believer that somewhere in the</v>

286
00:11:17.311 --> 00:11:21.540
<v Speaker 2>middle is where most of the truth sets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm sure there's definitely polar</v>

287
00:11:21.541 --> 00:11:24.060
<v Speaker 2>bear problems higher north,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right in the ice caps.</v>

288
00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:27.030
<v Speaker 2>And I mean I've seen some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some issues where they're talking about</v>

289
00:11:27.031 --> 00:11:31.380
<v Speaker 2>polar bear starving up there and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>lack of ice contributing to starvation</v>

290
00:11:31.381 --> 00:11:33.120
<v Speaker 2>deaths.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yeah,</v>

291
00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.290
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

292
00:11:34.291 --> 00:11:35.124
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

293
00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.210
<v Speaker 2>regardless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking forward to the last guy.</v>

294
00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:40.800
<v Speaker 2>I think regardless of what the hell</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened to the polar bears,</v>

295
00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:43.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have a good trip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

296
00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:44.700
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a beautiful state.</v>

297
00:11:44.701 --> 00:11:46.170
<v Speaker 2>People should get up there if they</v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't been up there.</v>

298
00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:47.270
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

299
00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:52.170
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the rare places that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>could go to in America that is like real</v>

300
00:11:52.171 --> 00:11:55.180
<v Speaker 2>wilderness and that is a really wild</v>
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

301
00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:56.110
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can get.</v>

302
00:11:56.111 --> 00:11:56.771
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

303
00:11:56.771 --> 00:11:59.570
<v Speaker 2>And it doesn't take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't take much to get up there and</v>

304
00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:00.610
<v Speaker 2>money I just made,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't,</v>

305
00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:03.300
<v Speaker 2>it's not the effort that people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think sometimes imagine it to be</v>

306
00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:04.780
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

307
00:12:04.781 --> 00:12:05.360
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's,</v>

308
00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:07.330
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a great trip.</v>

309
00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:10.960
<v Speaker 2>Kids really looking forward to it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's weird that it's the United States,</v>

310
00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.180
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you look at the map.</v>

311
00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:14.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think about how it was put together.</v>

312
00:12:14.831 --> 00:12:16.350
<v Speaker 2>That's a fascinating story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

313
00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:17.980
<v Speaker 2>for what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's worth people.</v>

314
00:12:17.981 --> 00:12:22.870
<v Speaker 2>That's another good interesting read is</v>
<v Speaker 2>how we cobbled this country together and</v>

315
00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:26.500
<v Speaker 2>sort of some of it was just incredible</v>
<v Speaker 2>genius on the part of some folks.</v>

316
00:12:26.501 --> 00:12:28.210
<v Speaker 2>Some of it was serendipity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of it was,</v>

317
00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:30.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>short sighted vision on the part of the</v>

318
00:12:30.401 --> 00:12:33.120
<v Speaker 2>Russians or the French or oh they fucked</v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

319
00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:35.650
<v Speaker 2>But with Alaska the Russians fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

320
00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:37.930
<v Speaker 2>What did they give that to us for like</v>
<v Speaker 2>50 bucks?</v>

321
00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:40.240
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't much money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't much.</v>

322
00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:42.910
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess we got our money's worth out of</v>

323
00:12:42.911 --> 00:12:44.520
<v Speaker 2>that by now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

324
00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:45.401
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>

325
00:12:45.401 --> 00:12:46.320
<v Speaker 2>we'll do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

326
00:12:46.321 --> 00:12:47.154
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

327
00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:49.090
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I planned this trip.</v>

328
00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:51.970
<v Speaker 2>Of course their school starts tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're there,</v>

329
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.190
<v Speaker 2>all three of them are in elementary</v>
<v Speaker 2>school,</v>

330
00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:58.240
<v Speaker 2>so their school starts tomorrow and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I gave my kid that option.</v>

331
00:12:58.241 --> 00:12:59.030
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you want to,</v>

332
00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:00.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he starts in fifth grade.</v>

333
00:13:00.911 --> 00:13:01.744
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you,</v>

334
00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:04.970
<v Speaker 2>do you want to stay here so you don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>miss the first few days at school?</v>

335
00:13:04.971 --> 00:13:08.410
<v Speaker 2>And he looked at me like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you crazy exactly an idiot.</v>

336
00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:09.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how.</v>

337
00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:10.840
<v Speaker 2>But it's what his eyes said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't say that.</v>

338
00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:13.210
<v Speaker 2>How old is he?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just turned 10.</v>

339
00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:15.220
<v Speaker 2>He's got to learn more in the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

340
00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:16.930
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For a couple of days.</v>

341
00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:18.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have a good time.</v>

342
00:13:18.011 --> 00:13:21.840
<v Speaker 2>Have a wonderful experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because of course the grizzlies are out</v>

343
00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:23.000
<v Speaker 2>looking for the salmon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

344
00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:24.670
<v Speaker 2>and it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just fantastic.</v>

345
00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:27.490
<v Speaker 2>That's the safest time to be around</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

346
00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:28.950
<v Speaker 2>So when their salmon out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

347
00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:31.510
<v Speaker 2>they're just fat and happy there and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't bother you.</v>

348
00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:33.440
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

349
00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:35.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if something happens to my 10 year old</v>

350
00:13:35.351 --> 00:13:36.880
<v Speaker 2>and my wife said it's going to be my</v>
<v Speaker 2>fault,</v>

351
00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:39.100
<v Speaker 2>that's on my head and I can't blame her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would,</v>

352
00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:42.340
<v Speaker 2>that would be true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But do you pack when you're out there,</v>

353
00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:44.050
<v Speaker 2>you packing the side arm?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

354
00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:46.180
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no we don't because we're,</v>

355
00:13:46.181 --> 00:13:49.120
<v Speaker 2>when we go up there and we're going up</v>
<v Speaker 2>with uh,</v>

356
00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:50.220
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

357
00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:54.540
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about a dozen other guys and they pan,</v>

358
00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:57.380
<v Speaker 2>they deal with the lodge does stay in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the small little sort of.</v>

359
00:13:57.381 --> 00:13:57.750
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

360
00:13:57.750 --> 00:13:58.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say launch.</v>

361
00:13:58.601 --> 00:14:00.100
<v Speaker 2>It's a wonderful place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Family owned.</v>

362
00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:03.820
<v Speaker 2>It's not a fancy place at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a great little spot and they do</v>

363
00:14:03.821 --> 00:14:05.650
<v Speaker 2>a great job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guides are fantastic.</v>

364
00:14:05.651 --> 00:14:06.680
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

365
00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:07.960
<v Speaker 2>we'll have a good time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

366
00:14:07.961 --> 00:14:09.580
<v Speaker 2>we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't take anything with us.</v>

367
00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:11.200
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

368
00:14:11.201 --> 00:14:12.070
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes sense.</v>

369
00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:13.630
<v Speaker 2>As long as the people up there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

370
00:14:13.631 --> 00:14:16.570
<v Speaker 2>you probably won't need anything as long</v>
<v Speaker 2>as the bears have fish.</v>

371
00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:18.041
<v Speaker 2>They really have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

372
00:14:18.041 --> 00:14:22.510
<v Speaker 2>There's an area that we've shown this</v>
<v Speaker 2>video before of this enormous grizzly</v>

373
00:14:22.511 --> 00:14:27.460
<v Speaker 2>that gets right next to this guy who's</v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting there photographing these bears,</v>

374
00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:32.350
<v Speaker 2>eating a fish out of the river,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the bear literally couldn't give a</v>

375
00:14:32.351 --> 00:14:34.630
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just looks at him and just sort of</v>

376
00:14:34.631 --> 00:14:38.410
<v Speaker 2>wanders off and there's actually a</v>
<v Speaker 2>statistic that no one has ever died in</v>

377
00:14:38.411 --> 00:14:39.370
<v Speaker 2>this area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

378
00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:42.760
<v Speaker 2>no person has ever been attacked or</v>
<v Speaker 2>killed in this one area just because</v>

379
00:14:42.761 --> 00:14:45.760
<v Speaker 2>it's just overrun with.so preoccupied</v>
<v Speaker 2>this time of year.</v>

380
00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:47.860
<v Speaker 2>But it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

381
00:14:47.861 --> 00:14:51.710
<v Speaker 2>you talk about how things change around</v>
<v Speaker 2>the planet and the salmon runs are</v>

382
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.740
<v Speaker 4>really being impacted right now by a</v>
<v Speaker 4>variety of reasons.</v>

383
00:14:54.741 --> 00:14:56.030
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not just one thing,</v>

384
00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:57.860
<v Speaker 4>but.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So anyway.</v>

385
00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:58.880
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that'll be,</v>

386
00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:00.500
<v Speaker 4>that'll be good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I know that everybody was really</v>

387
00:15:00.501 --> 00:15:02.360
<v Speaker 4>keen to hear about my upcoming trip.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

388
00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:04.730
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

389
00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:08.540
<v Speaker 4>it is interesting to hear people's take</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the climate issue because there's</v>

390
00:15:08.541 --> 00:15:09.920
<v Speaker 4>hard left and hard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

391
00:15:09.921 --> 00:15:11.240
<v Speaker 4>Hard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right is a,</v>

392
00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:13.520
<v Speaker 4>it's a cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's always happened this way and</v>

393
00:15:13.521 --> 00:15:14.750
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're impeding business.</v>

394
00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:18.170
<v Speaker 4>Hard left is we're all going to die and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then Miami's going to drown.</v>

395
00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:19.240
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

396
00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:23.150
<v Speaker 4>an Al Gore had dirty predicted in that</v>
<v Speaker 4>movie an inconvenient truth that we were</v>

397
00:15:23.151 --> 00:15:27.290
<v Speaker 4>going to be covered in water in 2014,</v>
<v Speaker 4>2014.</v>

398
00:15:27.291 --> 00:15:30.560
<v Speaker 4>They were predicting that the ocean</v>
<v Speaker 4>levels are going to rise the point where</v>

399
00:15:30.561 --> 00:15:32.780
<v Speaker 4>we're going to have to start evacuating</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of the coastal cities.</v>

400
00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:34.430
<v Speaker 4>And he missed that one just by a little</v>
<v Speaker 4>bit,</v>

401
00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:35.293
<v Speaker 4>but yeah.</v>

402
00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:37.130
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But baby came out with another movie.</v>

403
00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:41.490
<v Speaker 4>12 people saw an inconvenient truth and</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

404
00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:42.560
<v Speaker 4>nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nobody.</v>

405
00:15:42.561 --> 00:15:44.420
<v Speaker 4>I just watched it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think.</v>

406
00:15:44.421 --> 00:15:48.130
<v Speaker 4>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you see bill Nye when he was on Tucker</v>

407
00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:49.310
<v Speaker 4>Carlson's show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

408
00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:51.710
<v Speaker 4>it was very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was very interesting.</v>

409
00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:55.730
<v Speaker 4>Cause I'm bill Nye who is not really a</v>
<v Speaker 4>scientist.</v>

410
00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:56.571
<v Speaker 4>What is he?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is He,</v>

411
00:15:56.571 --> 00:16:01.571
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's just an engineer's near the base to</v>

412
00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:03.360
<v Speaker 4>have to be smart,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

413
00:16:03.361 --> 00:16:05.030
<v Speaker 4>he calls himself Bill Nye the science</v>
<v Speaker 4>guy.</v>

414
00:16:05.031 --> 00:16:07.070
<v Speaker 4>He's bothered by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as an undergraduate degree,</v>

415
00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:12.100
<v Speaker 4>sunny even a phd I want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they were uh,</v>

416
00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:17.210
<v Speaker 4>they were talking about climate change.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Tucker Carlson said,</v>

417
00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:22.010
<v Speaker 4>I'm willing to absolutely believe that</v>
<v Speaker 4>people have an impact on climate change.</v>

418
00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:23.720
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but can you tell me how much?</v>

419
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:27.830
<v Speaker 4>And then Bill Nye kind of got flustered</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

420
00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:31.820
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he got like little confrontational</v>

421
00:16:31.821 --> 00:16:32.550
<v Speaker 4>defensive.</v>

422
00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:35.400
<v Speaker 4>It's really kind of interesting because</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tucker kept pestering him like,</v>

423
00:16:35.401 --> 00:16:39.230
<v Speaker 4>we're talking about science.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I would like you to tell me how much</v>

424
00:16:39.231 --> 00:16:41.870
<v Speaker 4>of an impact have people had.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are the numbers?</v>

425
00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:44.230
<v Speaker 4>Is it a narrow range?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because you give me a narrow range.</v>

426
00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:49.720
<v Speaker 4>It's just what he does is he publicizes</v>
<v Speaker 4>science for his own personal benefit.</v>

427
00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:54.020
<v Speaker 4>Is that terrible show on Netflix.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bill Nye saves the world,</v>

428
00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:55.980
<v Speaker 4>bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not saving shit then.</v>

429
00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:57.560
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't call your shell.</v>

430
00:16:57.561 --> 00:17:00.530
<v Speaker 4>Bill Nye saves the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not saving the world with this</v>

431
00:17:00.531 --> 00:17:03.170
<v Speaker 4>crazy goddamn song about gender.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he has,</v>

432
00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.670
<v Speaker 4>oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you see that?</v>

433
00:17:04.671 --> 00:17:06.650
<v Speaker 4>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was stunning.</v>

434
00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:11.120
<v Speaker 4>Who The fuck greenlit dad?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I love Netflix,</v>

435
00:17:11.121 --> 00:17:12.700
<v Speaker 4>but hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a little quality controls.</v>

436
00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:15.470
<v Speaker 4>Not a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just have somebody on set to go hope.</v>

437
00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:20.480
<v Speaker 4>What we'll say is this like this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a sensor,</v>

438
00:17:20.541 --> 00:17:21.710
<v Speaker 4>like in the old,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that movie,</v>

439
00:17:21.711 --> 00:17:22.760
<v Speaker 4>good morning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Vietnam,</v>

440
00:17:22.830 --> 00:17:25.760
<v Speaker 4>you know somebody that sits there and</v>
<v Speaker 4>reads through his material before he</v>

441
00:17:25.761 --> 00:17:26.570
<v Speaker 4>does it and I saw that.</v>

442
00:17:26.570 --> 00:17:30.290
<v Speaker 4>Not that you know it clearly they don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>have anybody who has to approve as</v>

443
00:17:30.291 --> 00:17:33.080
<v Speaker 4>content.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That shows you where his mindset that</v>

444
00:17:33.081 --> 00:17:36.110
<v Speaker 4>he's willing to say yes to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's someone who wants to acquiesce</v>

445
00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.390
<v Speaker 4>with no uncertain terms to the left.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

446
00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:42.680
<v Speaker 4>Like he just wants to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Every meanwhile he had a film out of a</v>

447
00:17:42.681 --> 00:17:47.681
<v Speaker 4>movie or a television show out years ago</v>
<v Speaker 4>where he was describing gender and it</v>

448
00:17:47.931 --> 00:17:51.840
<v Speaker 4>was basically saying there's genders and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's about x and y chromosome,</v>

449
00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:54.780
<v Speaker 4>which is what everybody's been told in</v>
<v Speaker 4>science and biology class.</v>

450
00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:57.840
<v Speaker 4>Then he has this show just a few years</v>
<v Speaker 4>later where thou,</v>

451
00:17:57.841 --> 00:18:02.160
<v Speaker 4>the tide has turned politically where</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is such a weird subject about</v>

452
00:18:02.161 --> 00:18:07.161
<v Speaker 4>gender and sexual identity and gender</v>
<v Speaker 4>identity and so he's got these songs</v>

453
00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:08.670
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

454
00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:10.860
<v Speaker 4>like what that lady singing that song</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

455
00:18:10.861 --> 00:18:13.680
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is fucking terrible.</v>

456
00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:16.320
<v Speaker 4>Like what all you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just like the same thing as</v>

457
00:18:16.321 --> 00:18:17.960
<v Speaker 4>president trump staring at the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

458
00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:22.380
<v Speaker 4>All you're doing is setting yourself up</v>
<v Speaker 4>for rootless criticism.</v>

459
00:18:22.381 --> 00:18:25.620
<v Speaker 4>That's going to diminish any potential</v>
<v Speaker 4>legitimate point that you actually have.</v>

460
00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:28.740
<v Speaker 3>But I will say this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he really got pilloried</v>

461
00:18:28.741 --> 00:18:29.251
<v Speaker 3>for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

462
00:18:29.251 --> 00:18:31.320
<v Speaker 3>I mean nobody really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

463
00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:33.750
<v Speaker 3>I mean there was some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some mine.</v>

464
00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:35.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think some people make fun of them,</v>

465
00:18:35.401 --> 00:18:36.630
<v Speaker 3>but I think Bill Knight for the most</v>
<v Speaker 3>part,</v>

466
00:18:36.631 --> 00:18:39.150
<v Speaker 3>he knows it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very comfortable place for him to</v>

467
00:18:39.151 --> 00:18:40.380
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or for a lot of people,</v>

468
00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:41.340
<v Speaker 3>if they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

469
00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:44.430
<v Speaker 3>I just want to get the adulation of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>left,</v>

470
00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:48.690
<v Speaker 3>the far left and then fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's what you want to do,</v>

471
00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:51.930
<v Speaker 3>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you see people that kind of shift</v>

472
00:18:51.931 --> 00:18:55.290
<v Speaker 3>their position and are happy to be there</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they know they're going to be</v>

473
00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:56.740
<v Speaker 3>coddled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I.</v>

474
00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:59.580
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get why he does it because it's a base</v>

475
00:18:59.581 --> 00:19:00.560
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of uh,</v>

476
00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:04.320
<v Speaker 3>it's an audience that he knows is gonna</v>
<v Speaker 3>stick with them as long as he says the</v>

477
00:19:04.321 --> 00:19:06.540
<v Speaker 3>right things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And apparently he doesn't really give a</v>

478
00:19:06.541 --> 00:19:08.760
<v Speaker 3>shit about science.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's happy to say anything.</v>

479
00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:10.320
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he does give a shit about</v>

480
00:19:10.321 --> 00:19:11.154
<v Speaker 3>science.</v>

481
00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:15.940
<v Speaker 4>He gives a shit more about people liking</v>
<v Speaker 4>him and fitting in with this crowd of</v>

482
00:19:15.941 --> 00:19:17.680
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a weird thing that's going on in</v>

483
00:19:17.681 --> 00:19:21.610
<v Speaker 4>science and there's nothing like science</v>
<v Speaker 4>is fantastic.</v>

484
00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:25.630
<v Speaker 4>It's critical for our civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a science criticizer,</v>

485
00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:29.620
<v Speaker 4>but there's a weird thing about people</v>
<v Speaker 4>that are a part of science where their</v>

486
00:19:29.621 --> 00:19:34.621
<v Speaker 4>own egos and their own need for positive</v>
<v Speaker 4>affirmation sort of supersede any</v>

487
00:19:36.041 --> 00:19:38.710
<v Speaker 4>critical thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's certain subjects that cannot</v>

488
00:19:38.711 --> 00:19:41.160
<v Speaker 4>be discussed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's certain things that like,</v>

489
00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:42.160
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're almost like,</v>

490
00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:44.440
<v Speaker 4>it's almost like science,</v>
<v Speaker 4>religion,</v>

491
00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:47.670
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's certain subjects that are,</v>

492
00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:49.750
<v Speaker 4>aren't even open to scrutiny.</v>

493
00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:51.450
<v Speaker 3>Well I think that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think part of it is,</v>

494
00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:54.820
<v Speaker 3>is also we have gotten to a point where</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't,</v>

495
00:19:55.480 --> 00:20:00.480
<v Speaker 3>and I don't know how you walk it back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can't have conflicting ideas in</v>

496
00:20:00.551 --> 00:20:03.960
<v Speaker 3>the same statement or the same sentence</v>
<v Speaker 3>and an idea.</v>

497
00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:05.710
<v Speaker 3>Things conflict all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

498
00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:10.730
<v Speaker 3>And you can have a truths that collide</v>
<v Speaker 3>with each other and don't.</v>

499
00:20:10.961 --> 00:20:12.550
<v Speaker 3>I don't necessarily make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

500
00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:16.810
<v Speaker 3>But it seems as if now everything has to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be an absolute and whether it's climate</v>

501
00:20:16.811 --> 00:20:18.040
<v Speaker 3>change,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you can't say,</v>

502
00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:19.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>

503
00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:22.660
<v Speaker 3>if you just have this middle of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>road,</v>

504
00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:24.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>discussion where you're saying,</v>

505
00:20:24.011 --> 00:20:24.844
<v Speaker 3>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>

506
00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:27.040
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>humans I'm sure have some impact.</v>

507
00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:28.690
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

508
00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:30.560
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a problem,</v>

509
00:20:30.561 --> 00:20:32.560
<v Speaker 3>then we do have to do our part and we do</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to work to,</v>

510
00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:34.360
<v Speaker 3>to try to be the best we can be.</v>

511
00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:37.450
<v Speaker 3>But that's not good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got to,</v>

512
00:20:37.451 --> 00:20:41.500
<v Speaker 3>you've got to be a sort of totalitarian</v>
<v Speaker 3>about the whole issue.</v>

513
00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:44.470
<v Speaker 3>And it's not just that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's any argument,</v>

514
00:20:44.471 --> 00:20:46.980
<v Speaker 3>it just seems as if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's not just a millennial,</v>

515
00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:49.420
<v Speaker 3>so I'm not wanting to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to beat on,</v>

516
00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:51.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the young kids or the generation of</v>

517
00:20:51.851 --> 00:20:54.760
<v Speaker 3>whatever we want to call them nowadays</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I know a lot of good kids that</v>

518
00:20:54.761 --> 00:20:57.850
<v Speaker 3>are out there that are working hard or</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're in the military and it's a</v>

519
00:20:57.851 --> 00:21:01.150
<v Speaker 3>fantastic group of folks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think we're just fine in that</v>

520
00:21:01.151 --> 00:21:02.890
<v Speaker 3>regard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there does seem to be something</v>

521
00:21:02.891 --> 00:21:06.880
<v Speaker 3>about each successive generation and</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've gotten to a point where people</v>

522
00:21:06.881 --> 00:21:11.650
<v Speaker 3>have a hard time processing this</v>
<v Speaker 3>dissenting opinion idea and that starts</v>

523
00:21:11.651 --> 00:21:15.700
<v Speaker 3>to shut down debate and it starts to</v>
<v Speaker 3>shut down the idea that you can have a</v>

524
00:21:15.701 --> 00:21:17.590
<v Speaker 3>discussion about science,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you have,</v>

525
00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:20.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these conflicting ideas and how do you,</v>

526
00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:22.870
<v Speaker 3>how do you resolve them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That used to be the whole concept about</v>

527
00:21:22.871 --> 00:21:27.160
<v Speaker 3>sciences to test theories and with</v>
<v Speaker 3>little works and anyway,</v>

528
00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:29.880
<v Speaker 4>what do I think?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's because we're attaching egos and</v>

529
00:21:29.881 --> 00:21:34.170
<v Speaker 4>personalities and virtue signaling to</v>
<v Speaker 4>the actual hard data itself,</v>

530
00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:36.030
<v Speaker 4>but here's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's the thing that we should all be</v>

531
00:21:36.031 --> 00:21:37.680
<v Speaker 4>concerned with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pollution.</v>

532
00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:39.570
<v Speaker 4>We should all be concerned with human</v>
<v Speaker 4>waste.</v>

533
00:21:39.571 --> 00:21:43.650
<v Speaker 4>We should all be concerned with the</v>
<v Speaker 4>damage that we're doing to our water,</v>

534
00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:46.230
<v Speaker 4>the damage that we're doing to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>environment,</v>

535
00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:49.350
<v Speaker 4>the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a host of different things that</v>

536
00:21:49.351 --> 00:21:53.100
<v Speaker 4>human beings are involved in that are</v>
<v Speaker 4>creating irreparable harm to the</v>

537
00:21:53.101 --> 00:21:54.750
<v Speaker 4>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We should absolutely be concerned with</v>

538
00:21:54.751 --> 00:21:56.790
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what's weird is that you hardly ever</v>

539
00:21:56.791 --> 00:21:59.670
<v Speaker 4>hear about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You hardly ever hear about doing</v>

540
00:21:59.671 --> 00:22:04.320
<v Speaker 4>something to curb the plastic in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>ocean and doing something to eliminate</v>

541
00:22:04.321 --> 00:22:06.060
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some of the sewage waste that goes into</v>

542
00:22:06.061 --> 00:22:07.580
<v Speaker 4>the ocean doing the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

543
00:22:07.610 --> 00:22:10.230
<v Speaker 4>there's a ton of different things that</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're doing that are huge issues,</v>

544
00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:14.610
<v Speaker 4>but instead you hear about climate</v>
<v Speaker 4>change and it becomes this ideological</v>

545
00:22:14.611 --> 00:22:17.970
<v Speaker 4>left versus right battle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is very weird to me.</v>

546
00:22:17.971 --> 00:22:21.960
<v Speaker 4>And I understand that climate change is</v>
<v Speaker 4>a real issue and if the ocean water</v>

547
00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:25.290
<v Speaker 4>continues to rise,</v>
<v Speaker 4>coastal cities really are fucked and if</v>

548
00:22:25.291 --> 00:22:28.620
<v Speaker 4>the temperature does rise,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we really might have to migrate to more</v>

549
00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:33.420
<v Speaker 4>better climates.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there's a lot of other shit going on</v>

550
00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:36.030
<v Speaker 4>that seems to get ignored during this</v>
<v Speaker 4>process.</v>

551
00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:36.240
<v Speaker 4>Just,</v>

552
00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:36.820
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

553
00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:39.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm old enough to remember when a</v>

554
00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:41.500
<v Speaker 3>plastics that was an issue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

555
00:22:41.501 --> 00:22:43.900
<v Speaker 3>Plastic bags or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or um,</v>

556
00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:46.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>keeping the oceans clean or you know,</v>

557
00:22:46.661 --> 00:22:47.600
<v Speaker 3>don't be a little bug.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

558
00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:48.820
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was more of a,</v>

559
00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:52.330
<v Speaker 3>it was things that you could accomplish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

560
00:22:52.331 --> 00:22:54.160
<v Speaker 3>It was things that you could do with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>community.</v>

561
00:22:54.161 --> 00:22:57.160
<v Speaker 3>Could do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you would have these community drive</v>

562
00:22:57.161 --> 00:23:02.161
<v Speaker 3>to pick up trash or to not use plastic</v>
<v Speaker 3>bags or to whatever it is,</v>

563
00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:06.850
<v Speaker 3>and it was stuff that you could do and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could see some results and it felt</v>

564
00:23:06.851 --> 00:23:09.600
<v Speaker 3>good about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

565
00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:11.590
<v Speaker 3>who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe we've gone past that now.</v>

566
00:23:11.650 --> 00:23:12.680
<v Speaker 3>And so now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

567
00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:15.120
<v Speaker 3>that's not good enough because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

568
00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:18.250
<v Speaker 3>now we've got to save the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Will you save the planet these little</v>

569
00:23:18.251 --> 00:23:19.420
<v Speaker 3>steps at a time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

570
00:23:19.690 --> 00:23:21.160
<v Speaker 3>If every,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every community says,</v>

571
00:23:21.161 --> 00:23:21.740
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

572
00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:23.470
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry I can't do anything about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>polar bears,</v>

573
00:23:23.471 --> 00:23:25.360
<v Speaker 3>so fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to worry about myself.</v>

574
00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:27.550
<v Speaker 3>But if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you bring it back down to those</v>

575
00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:29.230
<v Speaker 3>little things like you would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

576
00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:33.040
<v Speaker 3>maybe implying that I think we're better</v>
<v Speaker 3>off.</v>

577
00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:34.520
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And eventually you,</v>

578
00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:38.590
<v Speaker 3>you do make a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if all you do is talk about climate</v>

579
00:23:38.591 --> 00:23:41.140
<v Speaker 3>change and save the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people just get overwhelmed.</v>

580
00:23:41.141 --> 00:23:42.890
<v Speaker 3>It's like a lot of other things in life</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're just thinking,</v>

581
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.950
<v Speaker 3>fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just gonna focus on other shit.</v>

582
00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:45.990
<v Speaker 3>It was just so strange to</v>

583
00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:48.350
<v Speaker 4>climate change.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's become this weird ideological</v>

584
00:23:48.351 --> 00:23:51.470
<v Speaker 4>debate between the left and the right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and is it when it comes to plastic,</v>

585
00:23:51.471 --> 00:23:54.350
<v Speaker 4>there's a solution that's been around</v>
<v Speaker 4>for years for plastic.</v>

586
00:23:54.351 --> 00:23:58.700
<v Speaker 4>There's biodegradable hemp plastic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's existed for a long time.</v>

587
00:23:58.701 --> 00:24:00.950
<v Speaker 4>If they just legalized hemp farming</v>
<v Speaker 4>nationwide,</v>

588
00:24:00.951 --> 00:24:03.860
<v Speaker 4>federally let people grow hemp in mass</v>
<v Speaker 4>quantities.</v>

589
00:24:03.861 --> 00:24:06.530
<v Speaker 4>You could turn that into plastic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You would never have to worry about</v>

590
00:24:06.531 --> 00:24:09.080
<v Speaker 4>water bottles again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'd never have to worry about garbage</v>

591
00:24:09.081 --> 00:24:10.280
<v Speaker 4>bags.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He would never have to worry about</v>

592
00:24:10.281 --> 00:24:12.980
<v Speaker 4>anything because it's all be plant based</v>
<v Speaker 4>plastic,</v>

593
00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:16.070
<v Speaker 4>which is real biodegradable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You put it in the ground,</v>

594
00:24:16.071 --> 00:24:17.530
<v Speaker 4>it becomes dirt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what's the.</v>

595
00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:18.890
<v Speaker 4>What's the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's the holdup?</v>

596
00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:22.040
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>federally hemp has been legal since the</v>

597
00:24:22.041 --> 00:24:23.340
<v Speaker 4>19 thirties.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

598
00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:24.710
<v Speaker 4>that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

599
00:24:24.711 --> 00:24:28.700
<v Speaker 4>and all of that goes back to William</v>
<v Speaker 4>Randolph hearst conning people into</v>

600
00:24:28.701 --> 00:24:32.590
<v Speaker 4>making it illegal so we didn't have to</v>
<v Speaker 4>switch over his paper mills from wood</v>

601
00:24:32.591 --> 00:24:34.220
<v Speaker 4>son of a bitch.</v>

604

<v Speaker 4>what they did is they organized an</v>

608
00:24:45.531 --> 00:24:50.531
<v Speaker 4>actual campaign against Hamp as a</v>
<v Speaker 4>commodity by demonizing this thing that</v>

609
00:24:52.131 --> 00:24:53.780
<v Speaker 4>they called marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which didn't even,</v>

610
00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:58.790
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't even the name of cannabis at</v>
<v Speaker 4>the time that marijuana was a name for a</v>

611
00:24:58.791 --> 00:25:02.630
<v Speaker 4>wild Mexican tobacco.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They applied that name to cannabis to</v>

612
00:25:02.631 --> 00:25:06.470
<v Speaker 4>say that there's this new drug that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>making Mexicans and blacks rape white</v>

613
00:25:06.471 --> 00:25:07.810
<v Speaker 4>women and they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

614
00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:11.360
<v Speaker 4>he was a piece of Shit that William</v>
<v Speaker 4>Randolph hearst and he printed all these</v>

615
00:25:11.361 --> 00:25:14.690
<v Speaker 4>articles and his papers and they made</v>
<v Speaker 4>reefer madness and all that stuff.</v>

616
00:25:14.691 --> 00:25:16.400
<v Speaker 4>All those movies that they made back in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the day.</v>

620
00:25:21.001 --> 00:25:22.720
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then of course they made citizen</v>

621
00:25:22.721 --> 00:25:26.430
<v Speaker 2>Kane and that turned her into a</v>
<v Speaker 2>household name and uh,</v>

622
00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:29.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>relatively benign character,</v>

623
00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:30.243
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Orson Welles,</v>

624
00:25:30.370 --> 00:25:33.130
<v Speaker 2>I wonder what he did to Orson Welles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He must have fucked with them a little</v>

625
00:25:33.131 --> 00:25:33.650
<v Speaker 2>bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't you think?</v>

626
00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:34.483
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

627
00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:35.950
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

628
00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:39.360
<v Speaker 2>When we did that movie come out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>citizen Kane came out in a long time.</v>

629
00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:40.510
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are like,</v>

630
00:25:40.511 --> 00:25:42.700
<v Speaker 2>why are they talking?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to say it was the fifties.</v>

631
00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:46.370
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was earlier than that I think was 19,</v>

632
00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:47.913
<v Speaker 2>19,</v>
<v Speaker 2>41.</v>

633
00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:48.790
<v Speaker 2>Forty one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

634
00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:52.660
<v Speaker 2>Rko pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Still to this day,</v>

635
00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:54.780
<v Speaker 2>it's an airplane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't believe I was.</v>

636
00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:57.300
<v Speaker 2>I was on an airplane not too long ago</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was looking to the movies</v>

637
00:25:57.301 --> 00:25:58.850
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Am I going to watch anything or am I get</v>

638
00:25:59.020 --> 00:25:59.853
<v Speaker 2>up?</v>

639
00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:04.090
<v Speaker 2>And Susan Cain was on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't put,</v>

640
00:26:04.091 --> 00:26:06.370
<v Speaker 2>which was strange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was right there in the middle of all</v>

641
00:26:06.371 --> 00:26:11.140
<v Speaker 2>these typical marvel and DC comics</v>
<v Speaker 2>movies that you would expect on a plane.</v>

642
00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:14.710
<v Speaker 2>That's odd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I started watching it and the,</v>

643
00:26:14.711 --> 00:26:16.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dude next to me in the seat next to</v>

644
00:26:16.601 --> 00:26:19.090
<v Speaker 2>me kind of starts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can tell when someone's watching</v>

645
00:26:19.091 --> 00:26:21.940
<v Speaker 2>your screen over there finally</v>
<v Speaker 2>attachment of the show.</v>

646
00:26:21.941 --> 00:26:23.230
<v Speaker 2>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you watching?</v>

647
00:26:23.770 --> 00:26:27.220
<v Speaker 2>And he was you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was probably a couple of years</v>

648
00:26:27.221 --> 00:26:28.450
<v Speaker 2>younger than me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not much.</v>

649
00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:30.220
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I watch citizen Kane.</v>

650
00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:32.000
<v Speaker 2>Never heard of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never,</v>

651
00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:33.070
<v Speaker 2>never heard of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish,</v>

652
00:26:33.071 --> 00:26:34.300
<v Speaker 2>I guess no big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fine.</v>

653
00:26:34.330 --> 00:26:36.730
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jerry Lewis died and people are probably</v>

654
00:26:36.731 --> 00:26:37.510
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's that?</v>

655
00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:39.070
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably one of those dudes at the gym.</v>

656
00:26:39.071 --> 00:26:42.070
<v Speaker 2>It talks too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's one of those guys that comes up to</v>

657
00:26:42.071 --> 00:26:43.450
<v Speaker 2>you while you're benching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna.</v>

658
00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:44.310
<v Speaker 2>Ask a question,</v>

659
00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:47.310
<v Speaker 4>am I doing this right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or even where I still go,</v>

660
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:52.140
<v Speaker 4>you should drop your shoulder a little</v>
<v Speaker 4>bit with those fucking guys because what</v>

661
00:26:52.141 --> 00:26:55.020
<v Speaker 4>you'll do is you'll stress that and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>that'll be better for you and you'll.</v>

662
00:26:55.650 --> 00:26:56.290
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>

663
00:26:56.290 --> 00:26:59.070
<v Speaker 4>Love those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They use big words.</v>

664
00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:02.250
<v Speaker 4>Try to convince you they know what</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're talking about.</v>

665
00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:06.240
<v Speaker 4>So speaking of a citizen Kane and Orson</v>
<v Speaker 4>Welles and conspiracies,</v>

666
00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:11.350
<v Speaker 4>last night I rewatched the episode of</v>
<v Speaker 4>Geraldo Rivera is good night America</v>

667
00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:15.020
<v Speaker 4>when they introduced the Zapruder</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you know,</v>

668
00:27:15.021 --> 00:27:16.390
<v Speaker 4>Dick Gregory just died.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

669
00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:17.263
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

670
00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:20.060
<v Speaker 4>They introduced this approved or film to</v>
<v Speaker 4>the American public,</v>

671
00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:21.930
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>13 years or 12 years,</v>

672
00:27:21.931 --> 00:27:25.320
<v Speaker 4>12 years after Kennedy's assassination.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

673
00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:28.440
<v Speaker 4>then I went and read that paper,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the articles.</v>

674
00:27:28.441 --> 00:27:30.240
<v Speaker 4>That was the printed a couple of weeks</v>
<v Speaker 4>ago that,</v>

675
00:27:30.241 --> 00:27:31.410
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you even tweeted about it,</v>

676
00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:36.270
<v Speaker 4>about the CIA questioning the official</v>
<v Speaker 4>story of the JFK assassination.</v>

677
00:27:36.271 --> 00:27:36.800
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

678
00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:37.760
<v Speaker 4>That was interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wasn't it?</v>

679
00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:40.290
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the CIA guy,</v>

680
00:27:40.291 --> 00:27:41.640
<v Speaker 4>what do you think about that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

681
00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:42.810
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's approved of film.</v>

682
00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:46.160
<v Speaker 2>That's the most watched piece of film in</v>
<v Speaker 2>history of film has a really,</v>

683
00:27:46.161 --> 00:27:47.360
<v Speaker 2>which is really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

684
00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:48.853
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

685
00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:50.840
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was interesting that the,</v>

686
00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:53.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as typical with a lot of these things</v>

687
00:27:53.691 --> 00:27:56.510
<v Speaker 2>that the headline doesn't necessarily</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually match once you get into the</v>

688
00:27:56.511 --> 00:28:00.560
<v Speaker 2>body of the story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the idea being that the agency</v>

689
00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:07.390
<v Speaker 2>had some concerns over</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea that perhaps a Cuba was behind</v>

690
00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:14.090
<v Speaker 2>the assassination was the Russians to</v>
<v Speaker 2>some degree or some more likely in a</v>

691
00:28:14.091 --> 00:28:16.450
<v Speaker 2>combination of the two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

692
00:28:16.790 --> 00:28:17.623
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

693
00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:19.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do,</v>

694
00:28:19.461 --> 00:28:20.390
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

695
00:28:20.450 --> 00:28:21.283
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

696
00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:23.060
<v Speaker 2>he could have taken that shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

697
00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:24.153
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>

698
00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:24.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was not.</v>

699
00:28:24.890 --> 00:28:28.040
<v Speaker 2>I said I've been up in that book</v>
<v Speaker 2>depository from that point of view,</v>

700
00:28:28.041 --> 00:28:29.720
<v Speaker 2>that vantage point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We did a story on the,</v>

701
00:28:29.721 --> 00:28:30.554
<v Speaker 2>on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

702
00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:31.663
<v Speaker 2>the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

703
00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:34.040
<v Speaker 2>issue that conspiracy theory and what</v>
<v Speaker 2>could have happened.</v>

704
00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:35.630
<v Speaker 2>Then we tried to find some new witnesses</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

705
00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:37.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could he have made that shot?</v>

706
00:28:37.251 --> 00:28:37.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>

707
00:28:37.930 --> 00:28:39.230
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a straightforward,</v>

708
00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:41.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>effort was someone who had some</v>

709
00:28:41.091 --> 00:28:41.781
<v Speaker 2>training.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>

710
00:28:41.781 --> 00:28:43.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't the world's best shot,</v>

711
00:28:43.371 --> 00:28:45.200
<v Speaker 2>but he had sufficient training to make</v>
<v Speaker 2>that shot.</v>

712
00:28:45.201 --> 00:28:46.820
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's separate from</v>

713
00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:53.350
<v Speaker 2>his motivations and any potential</v>
<v Speaker 2>support that he may have gotten a during</v>

714
00:28:53.391 --> 00:28:55.100
<v Speaker 2>the course of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

715
00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:57.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that he,</v>

716
00:28:57.471 --> 00:28:58.580
<v Speaker 2>in his mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

717
00:28:58.910 --> 00:29:02.690
<v Speaker 2>he genuinely felt that this was going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get him into the revolution,</v>

718
00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:03.560
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That this was going to.</v>

719
00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:06.680
<v Speaker 2>It had a very unhappy experience in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russia when he was over there living,</v>

720
00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:08.590
<v Speaker 2>came back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

721
00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:12.650
<v Speaker 2>saw what was happening in Cuba,</v>
<v Speaker 2>desperately wanted to be part of that,</v>

722
00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:16.190
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>took an unexplained trip down to Mexico.</v>

723
00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:19.490
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which could well have been in an effort</v>

724
00:29:19.491 --> 00:29:24.220
<v Speaker 2>to find somebody who could support his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his desire to,</v>

725
00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:27.140
<v Speaker 2>to take some sort of action whether he</v>
<v Speaker 2>had formed in his mind that's what he</v>

726
00:29:27.141 --> 00:29:29.600
<v Speaker 2>was going to do at the time or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

727
00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:32.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there a still a possibility that,</v>

728
00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:33.950
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Cubans,</v>

729
00:29:33.951 --> 00:29:37.310
<v Speaker 2>which they're the Intel service there</v>
<v Speaker 2>would have had to file on him.</v>

730
00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:38.690
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a very,</v>

731
00:29:38.691 --> 00:29:40.580
<v Speaker 2>very well known quantity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously by that time,</v>

732
00:29:40.581 --> 00:29:42.010
<v Speaker 2>for the Russians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Russians</v>

733
00:29:42.410 --> 00:29:45.430
<v Speaker 3>are solely responsible for training up</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Cuban Intel service.</v>

734
00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:50.640
<v Speaker 3>So there's a massive file on him and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they knew who they were dealing with.</v>

735
00:29:51.011 --> 00:29:53.890
<v Speaker 3>They knew his weaknesses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they knew his,</v>

736
00:29:54.250 --> 00:29:56.560
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they knew his motivations,</v>

737
00:29:56.561 --> 00:30:00.070
<v Speaker 3>they knew what to do in terms of trying</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get leverageable,</v>

738
00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:01.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

739
00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:02.650
<v Speaker 3>information on him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think that</v>

740
00:30:04.390 --> 00:30:06.070
<v Speaker 3>the jury's still out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>

741
00:30:06.071 --> 00:30:11.071
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not a conspiracy guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think there's enough there that</v>

742
00:30:11.171 --> 00:30:12.950
<v Speaker 3>says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

743
00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.530
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's Kinda like what we're talking about</v>

744
00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:15.670
<v Speaker 3>climate change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe this,</v>

745
00:30:15.671 --> 00:30:19.510
<v Speaker 3>but this also could be true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he could have taken that shot</v>

746
00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:21.030
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

747
00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:21.531
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

748
00:30:21.531 --> 00:30:26.380
<v Speaker 3>and succeeded,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's also possible that he may</v>

749
00:30:26.381 --> 00:30:30.550
<v Speaker 3>have had the encouragement of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in particular the Cuban Intel service</v>

750
00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:34.390
<v Speaker 3>through the Russians because at that</v>
<v Speaker 3>time in particular they didn't do</v>

751
00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:35.760
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Cubans didn't do anything without</v>

752
00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:38.530
<v Speaker 3>the Russians support blessings and</v>
<v Speaker 3>direction.</v>

753
00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:43.210
<v Speaker 3>So that is entirely possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

754
00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:46.330
<v Speaker 3>do I think that there were a variety of</v>
<v Speaker 3>other things at play,</v>

755
00:30:46.331 --> 00:30:47.164
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>

756
00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:50.170
<v Speaker 3>did they help him get the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

757
00:30:50.190 --> 00:30:50.741
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

758
00:30:50.741 --> 00:30:51.650
<v Speaker 3>the weapon?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did they,</v>

759
00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:52.050
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

760
00:30:52.050 --> 00:30:54.100
<v Speaker 3>was her actual logistical support in</v>
<v Speaker 3>there?</v>

761
00:30:54.101 --> 00:30:56.080
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so,</v>

762
00:30:56.081 --> 00:30:57.220
<v Speaker 3>but that'd be on maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

763
00:30:57.380 --> 00:30:57.901
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

764
00:30:57.901 --> 00:30:59.350
<v Speaker 3>it's a fascinating thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

765
00:30:59.351 --> 00:31:01.810
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody wants to think that something</v>

766
00:31:01.811 --> 00:31:06.700
<v Speaker 3>that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>impactful could have been just one guy</v>

767
00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:08.040
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

768
00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:11.140
<v Speaker 3>had a dream about being a hero of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>revolution.</v>

769
00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:12.360
<v Speaker 3>And I think they just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

770
00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:15.010
<v Speaker 3>it's such an awful thing to think about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want something bigger,</v>

771
00:31:15.011 --> 00:31:17.230
<v Speaker 3>you want something more behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>

772
00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:19.180
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will say the one thing that I think</v>

773
00:31:19.181 --> 00:31:21.940
<v Speaker 3>there was something else too was the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mlk,</v>

774
00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:24.310
<v Speaker 3>Martin Luther King assassination.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

775
00:31:24.311 --> 00:31:25.360
<v Speaker 3>let's get to that for sure,</v>

776
00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:29.220
<v Speaker 4>but here's the thing about the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Lee Harvey Oswald assassination,</v>

777
00:31:29.221 --> 00:31:30.840
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people think that there was</v>

778
00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:34.860
<v Speaker 4>people in the grassy knoll and that they</v>
<v Speaker 4>shot at the president and there was more</v>

779
00:31:34.861 --> 00:31:37.350
<v Speaker 4>than one shooter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's possible too.</v>

780
00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:40.560
<v Speaker 4>And here's the other problem with people</v>
<v Speaker 4>saying that Oswald could have never made</v>

781
00:31:40.561 --> 00:31:43.440
<v Speaker 4>that shot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course he could have 100 percent he</v>

782
00:31:43.441 --> 00:31:44.910
<v Speaker 4>could have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it likely?</v>

783
00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:47.820
<v Speaker 4>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people throw three point shots that have</v>

784
00:31:47.821 --> 00:31:50.800
<v Speaker 4>no fucking business on a basketball</v>
<v Speaker 4>court and they hit nothing but net.</v>

785
00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.530
<v Speaker 4>It happens all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't mean it's not likely that a</v>

786
00:31:55.531 --> 00:31:57.450
<v Speaker 4>guy could get off three shots that</v>
<v Speaker 4>quick,</v>

787
00:31:57.451 --> 00:31:58.284
<v Speaker 4>but it is possible.</v>

788
00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:01.440
<v Speaker 3>There was more time in there than they</v>
<v Speaker 3>originally thought.</v>

789
00:32:01.441 --> 00:32:03.390
<v Speaker 3>There been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some misinformation out there</v>

790
00:32:03.391 --> 00:32:06.470
<v Speaker 3>about how condensed that timeframe was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now after they've,</v>

791
00:32:07.170 --> 00:32:09.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>research has seemed to have a fairly.</v>

792
00:32:09.181 --> 00:32:11.430
<v Speaker 3>Well at that timeframe extended a little</v>
<v Speaker 3>bit,</v>

793
00:32:11.431 --> 00:32:13.980
<v Speaker 3>but he had more importantly he had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He worked up there.</v>

794
00:32:13.981 --> 00:32:15.960
<v Speaker 3>So he had the opportunity to see that</v>
<v Speaker 3>site.</v>

795
00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:17.310
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he was like,</v>

796
00:32:17.311 --> 00:32:20.220
<v Speaker 3>he was sitting in a blind weight and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then figuring out what am I going to be</v>

797
00:32:20.221 --> 00:32:23.820
<v Speaker 3>doing here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's a tremendous advantage and</v>

798
00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:26.400
<v Speaker 3>clear daylight targets moving right in</v>
<v Speaker 3>line with you.</v>

799
00:32:26.401 --> 00:32:27.480
<v Speaker 3>There's no wind.</v>

800
00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:30.060
<v Speaker 4>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not that far shot.</v>

801
00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:30.841
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not.</v>

802
00:32:30.841 --> 00:32:33.960
<v Speaker 4>It's not like everybody thinks it's like</v>
<v Speaker 4>a half mile away or something like that.</v>

803
00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:36.870
<v Speaker 4>I mean how far was it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was 150 yards or something like that</v>

804
00:32:37.290 --> 00:32:37.380
<v Speaker 4>to</v>

805
00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:38.850
<v Speaker 3>go back and find that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I've.</v>

806
00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:39.980
<v Speaker 3>But I've stood on that</v>

807
00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:44.180
<v Speaker 2>spot where the limo was at the site and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I stood up there and that down and it's</v>

808
00:32:44.181 --> 00:32:46.820
<v Speaker 2>not that far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's a total makeup was shot on a</v>

809
00:32:46.821 --> 00:32:47.710
<v Speaker 2>deer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

810
00:32:47.711 --> 00:32:48.950
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to shoot a deer with a</v>

811
00:32:48.951 --> 00:32:49.581
<v Speaker 2>rifle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd be like,</v>

812
00:32:49.581 --> 00:32:51.620
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's definitely my effective range.</v>

813
00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:54.080
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was no how far it would go.</v>

814
00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:56.270
<v Speaker 2>Two hundred and 60.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Five feet.</v>

815
00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:57.930
<v Speaker 2>Eighty one meters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That ain't shit.</v>

816
00:32:58.370 --> 00:33:02.300
<v Speaker 2>That's a bowshot yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could shoot an animal with a bow</v>

817
00:33:02.301 --> 00:33:04.820
<v Speaker 2>from 80 meters if you're really good and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no wind.</v>

818
00:33:05.570 --> 00:33:09.200
<v Speaker 2>So that's a really close shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the idea that he couldn't make that</v>

819
00:33:09.201 --> 00:33:10.790
<v Speaker 2>shot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a bad shot.</v>

820
00:33:10.791 --> 00:33:14.450
<v Speaker 2>That is so fucking stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He absolutely could make that shot and</v>

821
00:33:14.451 --> 00:33:16.820
<v Speaker 2>that will look that he could make that</v>
<v Speaker 2>shot from 81 meters.</v>

822
00:33:16.821 --> 00:33:19.100
<v Speaker 2>That's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We looked at the grassy knoll issue.</v>

823
00:33:19.101 --> 00:33:19.950
<v Speaker 2>We looked at the end of that.</v>

824
00:33:20.010 --> 00:33:20.900
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the,</v>

825
00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:23.500
<v Speaker 2>the train yard engineer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

826
00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:25.540
<v Speaker 2>reported seeing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

827
00:33:26.030 --> 00:33:29.600
<v Speaker 2>with a sort of a puff of smoke that he</v>
<v Speaker 2>thought he saw over by the fence line.</v>

828
00:33:29.601 --> 00:33:31.100
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're looking at like,</v>

829
00:33:31.101 --> 00:33:31.820
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could,</v>

830
00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:32.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from that position,</v>

831
00:33:32.901 --> 00:33:35.480
<v Speaker 2>they opened that place up and we were</v>
<v Speaker 2>able to go back up there and you could</v>

832
00:33:35.481 --> 00:33:37.550
<v Speaker 2>see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We ran a couple of tests and fired off a</v>

833
00:33:37.551 --> 00:33:39.630
<v Speaker 2>few shots and that's always fun if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to have,</v>

834
00:33:39.631 --> 00:33:42.980
<v Speaker 2>I've got a good time to take a rifle to</v>
<v Speaker 2>dealey plaza and fire off a few shots</v>

835
00:33:42.981 --> 00:33:44.840
<v Speaker 2>without the tourist knowing what the</v>
<v Speaker 2>hell is happening.</v>

836
00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:48.200
<v Speaker 2>And The Dallas police by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were tremendous during the course of</v>

837
00:33:48.201 --> 00:33:48.710
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

838
00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:50.750
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when did you guys do this?</v>

839
00:33:50.790 --> 00:33:53.990
<v Speaker 2>We did this a while back for a show</v>
<v Speaker 2>called American declassified,</v>

840
00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:55.700
<v Speaker 2>which isn't running anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

841
00:33:55.730 --> 00:33:58.280
<v Speaker 2>but it was on a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the travel channel.</v>

842
00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:01.610
<v Speaker 2>Jesse Ventura did that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He went up there and with a mandolin</v>

843
00:34:01.611 --> 00:34:06.350
<v Speaker 2>incur carcanos same rifle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was looking for a possible shock.</v>

844
00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:09.430
<v Speaker 2>No one could make the shock camp.</v>

845
00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:13.300
<v Speaker 2>I love Jesse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's awesome.</v>

846
00:34:13.970 --> 00:34:18.970
<v Speaker 2>But you to be conspiracy</v>
<v Speaker 2>significantly on that side to the point</v>

847
00:34:20.841 --> 00:34:21.560
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

848
00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:24.140
<v Speaker 2>that's he's leaning always toward the</v>
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy.</v>

849
00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:25.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you want to do is you want to do</v>

850
00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:28.130
<v Speaker 2>every investigation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I know this company that I've got,</v>

851
00:34:28.150 --> 00:34:31.070
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do a lot of investigations and you've</v>

852
00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:33.440
<v Speaker 2>got a bill just like with a homicide</v>
<v Speaker 2>case or anything else.</v>

853
00:34:33.441 --> 00:34:35.750
<v Speaker 2>You've got to build it on stable ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

854
00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:38.620
<v Speaker 2>So you have to start from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

855
00:34:38.690 --> 00:34:42.770
<v Speaker 2>the very basics because if you start</v>
<v Speaker 2>building ideas and investigative</v>

856
00:34:42.771 --> 00:34:45.860
<v Speaker 2>inquiries on something that's not sturdy</v>
<v Speaker 2>underneath it,</v>

857
00:34:45.890 --> 00:34:49.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not based on evidence and fact then you</v>

858
00:34:49.071 --> 00:34:51.200
<v Speaker 2>got a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing becomes suspect and</v>

859
00:34:51.201 --> 00:34:52.880
<v Speaker 2>usually comes toppling down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

860
00:34:53.330 --> 00:34:54.163
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

861
00:34:54.470 --> 00:34:57.140
<v Speaker 2>you got to keep an open mind about all</v>
<v Speaker 2>these things and I think it's important.</v>

862
00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:58.520
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now people are like,</v>

863
00:34:58.550 --> 00:35:00.470
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I'm sure that agency,</v>

864
00:35:00.471 --> 00:35:03.740
<v Speaker 2>the CIA was involved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm a terrible source of information.</v>

865
00:35:03.741 --> 00:35:04.700
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard that before.</v>

866
00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:07.010
<v Speaker 2>So you can't talk credibly about this</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>

867
00:35:07.011 --> 00:35:09.590
<v Speaker 2>the CIA was involved in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he is a thing of the CIA was</v>

868
00:35:09.591 --> 00:35:10.470
<v Speaker 2>involved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not you,</v>

869
00:35:10.590 --> 00:35:13.460
<v Speaker 2>you weren't there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was 62 last time I checked.</v>

870
00:35:13.461 --> 00:35:17.480
<v Speaker 2>I was not there in 1962 and a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and also I will tell you this much.</v>

871
00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:20.060
<v Speaker 2>Or was it 63?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was 60 slash six slash 63.</v>

872
00:35:20.061 --> 00:35:22.040
<v Speaker 2>If the age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the agency had been involved.</v>

873
00:35:22.370 --> 00:35:26.960
<v Speaker 2>This is the honest to God's truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no way that secret is still</v>

874
00:35:26.961 --> 00:35:29.450
<v Speaker 2>kept.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People can't keep their Yap shut.</v>

875
00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:33.830
<v Speaker 2>They can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And secrets have a way of coming out and</v>

876
00:35:33.831 --> 00:35:35.990
<v Speaker 2>certainly a lot quicker now than they</v>
<v Speaker 2>used to.</v>

877
00:35:36.290 --> 00:35:38.050
<v Speaker 2>So now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I did</v>

878
00:35:38.380 --> 00:35:41.130
<v Speaker 3>the secrets then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we're talking about so long ago</v>

879
00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:43.920
<v Speaker 3>how much talking to them more than 50</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>

880
00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:47.160
<v Speaker 3>Like get out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the DB cooper issue,</v>

881
00:35:47.250 --> 00:35:51.780
<v Speaker 3>my biggest reason for believing db</v>
<v Speaker 3>cooper died and his chute is hanging off</v>

882
00:35:51.781 --> 00:35:53.970
<v Speaker 3>a tree and that's a vast wilderness up</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

883
00:35:53.971 --> 00:35:55.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is,</v>

884
00:35:55.590 --> 00:35:58.680
<v Speaker 3>is that people just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can't help themselves at some point</v>

885
00:35:58.681 --> 00:36:01.860
<v Speaker 3>people talk or somebody talks somebody</v>
<v Speaker 3>associated with or somebody nearby or</v>

886
00:36:01.861 --> 00:36:04.830
<v Speaker 3>somebody involved or somebody on their</v>
<v Speaker 3>deathbed or somebody says something they</v>

887
00:36:04.831 --> 00:36:05.980
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

888
00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:07.680
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

889
00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:11.070
<v Speaker 3>the idea that they've maintained this</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of secret over a period of time.</v>

890
00:36:11.071 --> 00:36:13.710
<v Speaker 3>I find hard to believe I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 3>discounting it.</v>

891
00:36:13.711 --> 00:36:16.170
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got to leave a little space open</v>

892
00:36:16.171 --> 00:36:18.120
<v Speaker 3>for something that could be just</v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing.</v>

893
00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:21.180
<v Speaker 3>But</v>
<v Speaker 3>anyway,</v>

894
00:36:21.181 --> 00:36:22.920
<v Speaker 3>so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was that.</v>

895
00:36:22.921 --> 00:36:23.401
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

896
00:36:23.401 --> 00:36:25.390
<v Speaker 3>I agree that shot was not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

897
00:36:25.410 --> 00:36:28.860
<v Speaker 3>was not a tough shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One meters ain't shit and that's nothing</v>

898
00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:31.140
<v Speaker 3>in particular in those conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I will say those conditions were</v>

899
00:36:31.141 --> 00:36:33.960
<v Speaker 3>ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unfortunately for that event.</v>

900
00:36:34.510 --> 00:36:38.680
<v Speaker 4>People are like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a video of me shooting a fucking</v>

901
00:36:38.681 --> 00:36:43.090
<v Speaker 4>hard drive at a hundred yards,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a hard drive and you must have hit it</v>

902
00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:44.220
<v Speaker 4>that hard drive edge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

903
00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:46.480
<v Speaker 4>we getting rid of some hard yards,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thought it'd be fun to take it to the</v>

904
00:36:46.481 --> 00:36:49.150
<v Speaker 4>rifle range,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I'd take it to the rifle and</v>

905
00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:52.930
<v Speaker 4>obviously we're dealing with modern</v>
<v Speaker 4>rifles are probably more accurate,</v>

906
00:36:53.170 --> 00:36:56.770
<v Speaker 4>but I'm shooting something that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>basically two inches high,</v>

907
00:36:56.860 --> 00:37:00.250
<v Speaker 4>laying it down on the ground at a</v>
<v Speaker 4>hundred yards and blown to smithereens.</v>

908
00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:02.680
<v Speaker 4>That's how accurate a rifle is at a</v>
<v Speaker 4>hundred yards.</v>

909
00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:05.620
<v Speaker 4>You tell me he couldn't get a headshot</v>
<v Speaker 4>at 81 meters.</v>

910
00:37:05.621 --> 00:37:06.140
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy.</v>

911
00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:06.761
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

912
00:37:06.761 --> 00:37:09.520
<v Speaker 3>she caught wind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course he could go to light.</v>

913
00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:12.850
<v Speaker 3>Did he go with he?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's really the question is,</v>

914
00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:15.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have some pretty good indication as</v>

915
00:37:15.641 --> 00:37:18.220
<v Speaker 3>to what he was thinking and what is</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously what his motivations were and</v>

916
00:37:18.221 --> 00:37:19.054
<v Speaker 3>that's important.</v>

917
00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:23.060
<v Speaker 4>It definitely was in with the Russians</v>
<v Speaker 4>definitely was involved in a lot of</v>

918
00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:27.830
<v Speaker 4>weird shit with communism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who knows what his entire full</v>

919
00:37:27.831 --> 00:37:30.810
<v Speaker 4>background was because there was a lot</v>
<v Speaker 4>of covert shit going on.</v>

920
00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:33.640
<v Speaker 3>Did he?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did he express a desire to do something</v>

921
00:37:33.641 --> 00:37:36.730
<v Speaker 3>like this to the Russians at some point</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they know that,</v>

922
00:37:36.731 --> 00:37:38.380
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well here's an interesting opportunity,</v>

923
00:37:38.410 --> 00:37:38.830
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

924
00:37:38.830 --> 00:37:40.900
<v Speaker 3>They would have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would have sparked on that and they</v>

925
00:37:40.901 --> 00:37:43.090
<v Speaker 3>would have thought about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would,</v>

926
00:37:43.091 --> 00:37:45.430
<v Speaker 3>they have actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

927
00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:47.920
<v Speaker 3>play on words intended,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but would they have pulled the trigger</v>

928
00:37:47.921 --> 00:37:52.840
<v Speaker 3>on an operation trying to push him into</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing an act like this indirectly</v>

929
00:37:52.841 --> 00:37:54.040
<v Speaker 3>through the Cubans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

930
00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:57.240
<v Speaker 4>Especially if like this crazy fuck Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go ahead and do this for us.</v>

931
00:37:57.710 --> 00:38:00.660
<v Speaker 4>So after the Bay of Pigs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people have to realize there was a lot</v>

932
00:38:00.661 --> 00:38:02.220
<v Speaker 4>of people pissed off at Kennedy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we lost</v>

933
00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:04.090
<v Speaker 3>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hated Buddy.</v>

934
00:38:04.170 --> 00:38:05.340
<v Speaker 3>Christian hated Kennedy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

935
00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:06.600
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

936
00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:09.540
<v Speaker 4>well that infamous video where he's</v>
<v Speaker 4>banging his shoe down on the table.</v>

937
00:38:09.541 --> 00:38:10.470
<v Speaker 4>We will bury you.</v>

938
00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:11.211
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

939
00:38:11.211 --> 00:38:11.601
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

940
00:38:11.601 --> 00:38:14.600
<v Speaker 3>it was the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the environment was right for them and</v>

941
00:38:14.601 --> 00:38:15.051
<v Speaker 3>they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>

942
00:38:15.051 --> 00:38:16.460
<v Speaker 3>the Russians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It shouldn't be a surprise to anybody</v>

943
00:38:16.490 --> 00:38:18.440
<v Speaker 3>when you talk about what they did during</v>
<v Speaker 3>this election.</v>

944
00:38:18.441 --> 00:38:20.450
<v Speaker 3>I mean they've been doing this forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There you go.</v>

945
00:38:20.451 --> 00:38:24.290
<v Speaker 3>Back to the 19 forties and the Russians,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were you spending a lot of time and</v>

946
00:38:24.291 --> 00:38:27.200
<v Speaker 3>effort and money here in the states</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to keep us out of the war?</v>

947
00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:31.080
<v Speaker 3>Back before Hitler invaded Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they were allied with the Nazi</v>

948
00:38:31.081 --> 00:38:33.330
<v Speaker 3>still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they spent a lot of time.</v>

949
00:38:33.331 --> 00:38:36.460
<v Speaker 3>They set up independent association.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Supposedly</v>

950
00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:38.750
<v Speaker 2>they paid off a lot of unions and union</v>
<v Speaker 2>members,</v>

951
00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:40.990
<v Speaker 2>a journalists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they were doing everything they</v>

952
00:38:40.991 --> 00:38:45.070
<v Speaker 2>could create this or to strengthen the</v>
<v Speaker 2>idea of isolationism just to keep us</v>

953
00:38:45.071 --> 00:38:47.170
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've been doing this for as long as</v>

954
00:38:47.171 --> 00:38:48.920
<v Speaker 2>they've been around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anybody who says,</v>

955
00:38:48.921 --> 00:38:49.261
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't.</v>

956
00:38:49.261 --> 00:38:49.890
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

957
00:38:49.890 --> 00:38:51.850
<v Speaker 2>it's shocking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Russians will be engaged in this is.</v>

958
00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:53.140
<v Speaker 2>It's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've always been.</v>

959
00:38:53.141 --> 00:38:55.270
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we by the way have been engaged doing</v>

960
00:38:55.271 --> 00:38:56.290
<v Speaker 2>that with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

961
00:38:56.940 --> 00:38:58.270
<v Speaker 2>That's what I hear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fine.</v>

962
00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:01.510
<v Speaker 2>I've heard that online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find that hard to leave.</v>

963
00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:04.570
<v Speaker 2>The thing that bothers me the most about</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Kennedy assassination is the</v>

964
00:39:04.571 --> 00:39:07.180
<v Speaker 2>universal support for the magic bullet</v>
<v Speaker 2>theory.</v>

965
00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:09.850
<v Speaker 2>I think that fucking bullet is</v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous.</v>

966
00:39:10.210 --> 00:39:12.340
<v Speaker 2>I've shot things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've shot a lot of things.</v>

967
00:39:12.341 --> 00:39:15.040
<v Speaker 2>I know what happens to bullets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody that I know that's a marksman,</v>

968
00:39:15.041 --> 00:39:16.120
<v Speaker 2>everybody knows it's a hunter.</v>

969
00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:21.010
<v Speaker 2>They see a bullet that has hit bone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It fucking never looks like that.</v>

970
00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:25.420
<v Speaker 2>When a bullet goes through to people and</v>
<v Speaker 2>comes out looking like you shot it into</v>

971
00:39:25.421 --> 00:39:27.580
<v Speaker 2>a pool of water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what it looks like.</v>

972
00:39:27.581 --> 00:39:30.940
<v Speaker 2>I don't buy that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the convenience of finding it on</v>

973
00:39:30.941 --> 00:39:33.700
<v Speaker 2>Connolly's Gurney and they enroll them</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the hospital.</v>

974
00:39:33.730 --> 00:39:35.350
<v Speaker 2>Oh look guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we found the bullet.</v>

975
00:39:35.351 --> 00:39:36.370
<v Speaker 2>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's perfect.</v>

976
00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:38.530
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't buy that for a second.</v>

977
00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:42.760
<v Speaker 2>And the problem is there's more metal</v>
<v Speaker 2>fragments in connally's body.</v>

978
00:39:42.761 --> 00:39:44.410
<v Speaker 2>Then we're missing from the bullet</v>
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>

979
00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:47.110
<v Speaker 2>I think that bullet itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at that bullet.</v>

980
00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:51.340
<v Speaker 2>Get the caddy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That thing didn't hit shit.</v>

981
00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:52.620
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's exactly right.</v>

982
00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:55.600
<v Speaker 2>The conditioned with this with people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that have never shot guns.</v>

983
00:39:55.690 --> 00:39:59.350
<v Speaker 2>And they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well actually proven that broke bones</v>

984
00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:01.420
<v Speaker 2>and a bullet breaks bones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get fucked.</v>

985
00:40:01.470 --> 00:40:02.500
<v Speaker 2>Melissa jacketed bullets.</v>

986
00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:06.400
<v Speaker 2>When it's jacketed bullets breaks bones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gets fucked.</v>

987
00:40:06.730 --> 00:40:08.110
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about something that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>going.</v>

988
00:40:08.111 --> 00:40:10.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how fast is a bullet from that rifle go.</v>

989
00:40:10.810 --> 00:40:13.060
<v Speaker 2>It's got to be that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be interesting thing to pull</v>

990
00:40:13.061 --> 00:40:14.770
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I would imagine it's in the</v>

991
00:40:14.771 --> 00:40:17.140
<v Speaker 2>thousands of feet per second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got to be.</v>

992
00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:20.090
<v Speaker 2>When it hits bone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to it as well.</v>

993
00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:21.630
<v Speaker 2>There's always distortion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if you're.</v>

994
00:40:22.110 --> 00:40:25.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I don't know when you have a</v>

995
00:40:25.211 --> 00:40:29.650
<v Speaker 2>conversation about this and it is</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody who has no shooting experience</v>

996
00:40:29.651 --> 00:40:31.300
<v Speaker 2>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>

997
00:40:31.570 --> 00:40:32.171
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

998
00:40:32.171 --> 00:40:34.210
<v Speaker 2>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand why you're fascinated by</v>

999
00:40:34.211 --> 00:40:35.460
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but do,</v>

1000
00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:37.180
<v Speaker 2>when you do your research,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1001
00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:38.560
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like with news,</v>

1002
00:40:38.590 --> 00:40:39.990
<v Speaker 2>read everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1003
00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.620
<v Speaker 2>Read The Wall Street Journal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>read The New York Times,</v>

1004
00:40:41.621 --> 00:40:42.740
<v Speaker 2>read the Financial Times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>read,</v>

1005
00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:45.100
<v Speaker 2>read the economist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read everything.</v>

1006
00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:46.750
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Before you form your opinion.</v>

1007
00:40:46.751 --> 00:40:47.111
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1008
00:40:47.111 --> 00:40:49.990
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and everybody is so siloed nowadays and</v>

1009
00:40:49.991 --> 00:40:51.460
<v Speaker 2>you get the same thing with conspiracy</v>
<v Speaker 2>theories.</v>

1010
00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:53.470
<v Speaker 2>I absolutely believe this and I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to,</v>

1011
00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:56.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to discount everything else</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's out there and,</v>

1012
00:40:56.441 --> 00:40:58.480
<v Speaker 2>or just not pay any attention to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1013
00:40:59.310 --> 00:41:01.300
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's hard to say.</v>

1014
00:41:01.301 --> 00:41:03.640
<v Speaker 2>And here's another thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the magic bullet path.</v>

1015
00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:04.361
<v Speaker 2>People like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1016
00:41:04.361 --> 00:41:06.120
<v Speaker 2>how is that possible?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1017
00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:09.190
<v Speaker 2>let me tell you something that's the</v>
<v Speaker 2>most believable thing about the magic</v>

1018
00:41:09.191 --> 00:41:11.530
<v Speaker 2>bullet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is the path of the bullet because</v>

1019
00:41:11.531 --> 00:41:14.980
<v Speaker 2>bullets do wacky shit when they hit bone</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can't predict it at all.</v>

1020
00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:16.870
<v Speaker 2>I know a guy who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1021
00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:21.160
<v Speaker 2>in Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they shot a guy in the head from the</v>

1022
00:41:21.161 --> 00:41:25.120
<v Speaker 2>front and it went out as eyeball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The bullet came out of his eyeball back</v>

1023
00:41:25.121 --> 00:41:28.870
<v Speaker 2>forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It ricocheted inside of his skull and</v>

1024
00:41:28.871 --> 00:41:30.720
<v Speaker 2>came out as I know you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1025
00:41:30.730 --> 00:41:31.690
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't put you right,</v>

1026
00:41:31.691 --> 00:41:33.710
<v Speaker 2>you can't predict it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll try to model these things and</v>

1027
00:41:33.711 --> 00:41:35.390
<v Speaker 2>figure out a way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1028
00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:36.500
<v Speaker 2>there's an unknown there.</v>

1029
00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:37.670
<v Speaker 2>And so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

1030
00:41:37.671 --> 00:41:39.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that again,</v>

1031
00:41:39.561 --> 00:41:41.650
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one of those things where it,</v>

1032
00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:44.480
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's never going to get resolved and it,</v>

1033
00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:47.390
<v Speaker 2>it's going to continue to live on</v>
<v Speaker 2>because a,</v>

1034
00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:50.930
<v Speaker 2>it was such an important event in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>history of the country.</v>

1035
00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:52.280
<v Speaker 2>And B,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1036
00:41:52.310 --> 00:41:56.000
<v Speaker 2>I keep going back to that same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People don't want to believe that really</v>

1037
00:41:56.001 --> 00:41:58.820
<v Speaker 2>awful shit can happen sometimes in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>very simple,</v>

1038
00:41:58.821 --> 00:42:02.720
<v Speaker 2>straightforward way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's much easier to think it was</v>

1039
00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:05.930
<v Speaker 2>a broad base conspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were lots of moving parts,</v>

1040
00:42:06.350 --> 00:42:10.040
<v Speaker 2>sometimes bad shit happens and it's just</v>
<v Speaker 2>as simple as it seems that is possible.</v>

1041
00:42:10.041 --> 00:42:11.990
<v Speaker 2>Conversely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people don't like to believe in</v>

1042
00:42:11.991 --> 00:42:13.880
<v Speaker 2>conspiracies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when it's involved in an</v>

1043
00:42:13.881 --> 00:42:15.500
<v Speaker 2>assassination of president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1044
00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:18.980
<v Speaker 2>You know the reason why they came up</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the whole magic bullet theory in</v>

1045
00:42:18.981 --> 00:42:20.810
<v Speaker 2>the first place is pretty shady in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>first,</v>

1046
00:42:20.860 --> 00:42:23.090
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason why they did it because the</v>

1047
00:42:23.091 --> 00:42:28.091
<v Speaker 2>guy got hit by a ricochet underneath the</v>
<v Speaker 2>overpass and they blamed that bullet on</v>

1048
00:42:28.341 --> 00:42:31.160
<v Speaker 2>one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the shots from Lee Harvey Oswald</v>

1049
00:42:31.161 --> 00:42:32.150
<v Speaker 2>and the book depository.</v>

1050
00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:32.871
<v Speaker 2>So they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1051
00:42:32.871 --> 00:42:36.150
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so now we have less bullets that could</v>

1052
00:42:36.151 --> 00:42:38.600
<v Speaker 2>have hit Kennedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have all these wounds and we have to</v>

1053
00:42:38.601 --> 00:42:41.120
<v Speaker 2>attribute a series of wounds to one</v>
<v Speaker 2>bullet.</v>

1054
00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:41.931
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1055
00:42:41.931 --> 00:42:44.090
<v Speaker 2>So that was the thought process behind</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1056
00:42:44.091 --> 00:42:46.760
<v Speaker 2>But this is approved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or film was the one that got people</v>

1057
00:42:46.970 --> 00:42:49.310
<v Speaker 2>weirded out by it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'll tell you about men.</v>

1058
00:42:49.311 --> 00:42:53.420
<v Speaker 2>I've watched that film a bunch of times</v>
<v Speaker 2>and one of the things that don't jive is</v>

1059
00:42:53.421 --> 00:42:55.020
<v Speaker 2>if he did get hit from the front,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1060
00:42:55.090 --> 00:42:58.580
<v Speaker 2>head goes back to the left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is the blood spray out forward?</v>

1061
00:42:59.240 --> 00:42:59.950
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1062
00:42:59.950 --> 00:43:02.420
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's weird the way the impact of the</v>

1063
00:43:02.421 --> 00:43:05.840
<v Speaker 2>blood is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the blood sprays forward and then his</v>

1064
00:43:05.841 --> 00:43:08.720
<v Speaker 2>head goes back into the left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could have possibly been that he was</v>

1065
00:43:08.721 --> 00:43:11.030
<v Speaker 2>hit from the front end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the back at the same time.</v>

1066
00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:12.920
<v Speaker 2>That's entirely possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1067
00:43:12.921 --> 00:43:15.200
<v Speaker 2>that is a tactic you would do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1068
00:43:15.201 --> 00:43:18.560
<v Speaker 2>You would roll someone into an area</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they would be in a crossfire and</v>

1069
00:43:18.561 --> 00:43:21.290
<v Speaker 2>they'd get shot if they came in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If there was,</v>

1070
00:43:21.291 --> 00:43:22.050
<v Speaker 2>if the grass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1071
00:43:22.050 --> 00:43:24.890
<v Speaker 2>it was in fact a second site for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>shooter.</v>

1072
00:43:25.310 --> 00:43:30.310
<v Speaker 2>Then by the time it hits that corner and</v>
<v Speaker 2>starts its path just before the shots</v>

1073
00:43:32.061 --> 00:43:34.550
<v Speaker 2>were fired from the book depository and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oswald,</v>

1074
00:43:34.551 --> 00:43:35.780
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're going with that,</v>

1075
00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:38.720
<v Speaker 2>if you had an another shooter up on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>grass,</v>

1076
00:43:38.721 --> 00:43:40.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1077
00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:44.840
<v Speaker 2>you are basically looking right at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1078
00:43:44.841 --> 00:43:45.351
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1079
00:43:45.351 --> 00:43:47.120
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the front of the vehicle.</v>

1080
00:43:47.450 --> 00:43:50.660
<v Speaker 2>And because of the way that it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>positioned in the nols kind of turned</v>

1081
00:43:50.661 --> 00:43:55.661
<v Speaker 2>and then it's just that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just that there's not a lot of</v>

1082
00:43:57.350 --> 00:44:00.110
<v Speaker 2>concealment up there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they had that.</v>

1083
00:44:00.111 --> 00:44:01.970
<v Speaker 2>They had the fence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>picket fence.</v>

1084
00:44:01.970 --> 00:44:03.380
<v Speaker 2>It's not the original one that Sarah</v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore,</v>

1085
00:44:03.381 --> 00:44:06.050
<v Speaker 2>but it's basically in line with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can see there's plenty of</v>

1086
00:44:06.051 --> 00:44:07.200
<v Speaker 2>pictures of the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1087
00:44:07.330 --> 00:44:09.860
<v Speaker 2>the previous fence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was up there at the time.</v>

1088
00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:12.700
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you had that,</v>

1089
00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:17.600
<v Speaker 2>you did have the train yard engineer</v>
<v Speaker 2>report sometime after the fact that he</v>

1090
00:44:17.601 --> 00:44:20.810
<v Speaker 2>saw a puff of smoke and he wasn't quite</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure what that was all about and he'd</v>

1091
00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:24.710
<v Speaker 2>seen a couple of people back there so</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1092
00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:25.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>

1093
00:44:25.730 --> 00:44:27.920
<v Speaker 2>that's an interesting thread to pull on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1094
00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:28.870
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that,</v>

1095
00:44:28.871 --> 00:44:32.970
<v Speaker 2>that it's been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been ad nauseum doesn't mean that</v>

1096
00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:36.510
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't still find something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It also doesn't mean anybody's going to</v>

1097
00:44:36.511 --> 00:44:39.170
<v Speaker 2>really find a conclusion after the fact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1098
00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:40.530
<v Speaker 2>Firstly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>

1099
00:44:40.530 --> 00:44:41.041
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1100
00:44:41.041 --> 00:44:41.970
<v Speaker 2>And that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1101
00:44:41.971 --> 00:44:44.340
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's like everything else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as time marches on,</v>

1102
00:44:44.490 --> 00:44:46.290
<v Speaker 2>you lose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you lose witnesses,</v>

1103
00:44:46.291 --> 00:44:47.430
<v Speaker 2>you lose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1104
00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:50.910
<v Speaker 2>people that were there on site and even</v>
<v Speaker 2>witnesses when someone gets shot.</v>

1105
00:44:50.980 --> 00:44:52.820
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially with the precedent is not</v>

1106
00:44:52.830 --> 00:44:54.950
<v Speaker 2>credible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Five different stories from five</v>

1107
00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:57.420
<v Speaker 2>different people and gunshots heard from</v>
<v Speaker 2>the moon.</v>

1108
00:44:57.450 --> 00:44:59.520
<v Speaker 2>Nobody will get that just from a</v>
<v Speaker 2>robbery,</v>

1109
00:44:59.550 --> 00:45:02.340
<v Speaker 2>just straight driving in a car accident</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd say you'd say,</v>

1110
00:45:02.341 --> 00:45:03.900
<v Speaker 2>what did you see?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have separate people out,</v>

1111
00:45:03.901 --> 00:45:05.430
<v Speaker 2>you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll get five different versions from</v>

1112
00:45:05.431 --> 00:45:07.980
<v Speaker 2>five different people and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>

1113
00:45:07.981 --> 00:45:12.470
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't a witness accounts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tend not to be a particularly a</v>

1114
00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:14.600
<v Speaker 2>credible and you've got to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1115
00:45:14.601 --> 00:45:15.010
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1116
00:45:15.010 --> 00:45:19.040
<v Speaker 2>you got to take them and then you gotta</v>
<v Speaker 2>match it up with other information that</v>

1117
00:45:19.041 --> 00:45:20.520
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can pull together forensically.</v>

1118
00:45:20.521 --> 00:45:22.770
<v Speaker 2>But it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is fascinating.</v>

1119
00:45:22.771 --> 00:45:26.130
<v Speaker 2>I know who knows where it's going to DB</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cooper's back in the news a little bit</v>

1120
00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:27.120
<v Speaker 2>because it really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1121
00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:28.013
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've uh,</v>

1122
00:45:28.170 --> 00:45:29.790
<v Speaker 2>initially it was because the bureau was</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

1123
00:45:29.791 --> 00:45:30.330
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

1124
00:45:30.330 --> 00:45:31.560
<v Speaker 2>we're closing this case.</v>

1125
00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:34.350
<v Speaker 2>And then there's some talk now over the</v>
<v Speaker 2>past day and a half,</v>

1126
00:45:34.351 --> 00:45:37.710
<v Speaker 2>two days that they might've found</v>
<v Speaker 2>something up in the wilderness that</v>

1127
00:45:37.711 --> 00:45:40.230
<v Speaker 2>might be a piece of the shoot that he</v>
<v Speaker 2>had.</v>

1128
00:45:40.231 --> 00:45:42.930
<v Speaker 2>And I know they haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they haven't bought them that one out</v>

1129
00:45:42.931 --> 00:45:44.280
<v Speaker 2>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Cooper,</v>

1130
00:45:44.281 --> 00:45:47.010
<v Speaker 2>more new evidence of parachute believed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>found.</v>

1131
00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:49.180
<v Speaker 2>But how they know that's his parachute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1132
00:45:49.250 --> 00:45:50.630
<v Speaker 2>The thing about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1133
00:45:50.631 --> 00:45:52.680
<v Speaker 2>it could be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the thing about something that's</v>

1134
00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:56.820
<v Speaker 2>that long ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to realize how many people die</v>

1135
00:45:56.821 --> 00:45:58.060
<v Speaker 2>in the woods every year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1136
00:45:58.180 --> 00:45:59.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you go,</v>

1137
00:45:59.140 --> 00:46:00.650
<v Speaker 2>when you come out the back of that</v>
<v Speaker 2>plane,</v>

1138
00:46:01.110 --> 00:46:02.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1139
00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:05.370
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and also he was in a suit.</v>

1140
00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:07.550
<v Speaker 2>He was wearing loafers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He lost his shoes.</v>

1141
00:46:07.551 --> 00:46:09.840
<v Speaker 2>So he hits those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that wilderness.</v>

1142
00:46:09.841 --> 00:46:14.820
<v Speaker 2>He hits those trees and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was cold that night and it was wet.</v>

1143
00:46:14.910 --> 00:46:18.240
<v Speaker 2>And there's going to be a man hunt on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the morning.</v>

1144
00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:18.841
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had his,</v>

1145
00:46:18.841 --> 00:46:20.570
<v Speaker 2>he had his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had his,</v>

1146
00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:24.240
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a parachute and he had the bag with the</v>

1147
00:46:24.241 --> 00:46:25.930
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd given him money.</v>

1148
00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:26.820
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>

1149
00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:30.540
<v Speaker 2>that was it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm no wilderness gear at all.</v>

1150
00:46:30.570 --> 00:46:32.340
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well not that they know of.</v>

1151
00:46:32.341 --> 00:46:33.001
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows,</v>

1152
00:46:33.001 --> 00:46:35.460
<v Speaker 2>maybe underneath his business suit he</v>
<v Speaker 2>was wearing something,</v>

1153
00:46:35.490 --> 00:46:39.030
<v Speaker 2>but I'm just going to be wearing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what was the time of the year?</v>

1154
00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:40.980
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was late in the year I think.</v>

1155
00:46:41.010 --> 00:46:42.450
<v Speaker 2>I think I have to go back and check</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1156
00:46:42.451 --> 00:46:45.450
<v Speaker 2>but I think it was November,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to say part of the country up in</v>

1157
00:46:45.451 --> 00:46:46.060
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1158
00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:48.510
<v Speaker 2>the wilderness up in Washington state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1159
00:46:48.511 --> 00:46:51.270
<v Speaker 2>he's dead before thanksgiving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Before thanksgiving.</v>

1160
00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:52.113
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy's dead.</v>

1161
00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:55.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just not going to make you</v>

1162
00:46:55.150 --> 00:46:58.320
<v Speaker 2>make your way out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's nighttime and you know that.</v>

1163
00:46:58.321 --> 00:46:59.160
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1164
00:46:59.161 --> 00:47:00.890
<v Speaker 2>they again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be a manhunt starting.</v>

1165
00:47:01.810 --> 00:47:02.550
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's.</v>

1166
00:47:02.550 --> 00:47:05.370
<v Speaker 2>Trout wouldn't survive up there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's been all sorts of theories.</v>

1167
00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:07.830
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he jumped out and then some people met</v>

1168
00:47:07.831 --> 00:47:08.664
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1169
00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:10.890
<v Speaker 2>maybe good luck finding them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1170
00:47:11.070 --> 00:47:13.710
<v Speaker 2>How are you going to be able to be so</v>
<v Speaker 2>silly?</v>

1171
00:47:13.890 --> 00:47:16.710
<v Speaker 2>People jumping out of an airplane with</v>
<v Speaker 2>no gps.</v>

1172
00:47:17.130 --> 00:47:19.140
<v Speaker 2>Do the odds of finding that guy and he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

1173
00:47:19.141 --> 00:47:20.470
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't have a flare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what does,</v>

1174
00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:21.680
<v Speaker 2>what does he have?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How are you going to look at?</v>

1175
00:47:21.710 --> 00:47:24.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to just find him in the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I think there's,</v>

1176
00:47:24.420 --> 00:47:25.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was some talk,</v>

1177
00:47:25.351 --> 00:47:25.800
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1178
00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:27.920
<v Speaker 2>because some of his money was found,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1179
00:47:27.990 --> 00:47:30.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after the fact stacked in a,</v>

1180
00:47:30.431 --> 00:47:31.530
<v Speaker 2>in a little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1181
00:47:32.270 --> 00:47:35.920
<v Speaker 2>a part of the river that seemed unusual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1182
00:47:35.921 --> 00:47:39.340
<v Speaker 2>It seemed like it would have had to make</v>
<v Speaker 2>a pretty amazing journey from the</v>

1183
00:47:39.341 --> 00:47:44.080
<v Speaker 2>wilderness down through the stream</v>
<v Speaker 2>system out to the river and then be</v>

1184
00:47:44.081 --> 00:47:47.950
<v Speaker 2>found on this sandbar and it was all</v>
<v Speaker 2>stacked one on top of the other,</v>

1185
00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:50.980
<v Speaker 2>but it had the light,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it had the serial numbers.</v>

1186
00:47:51.550 --> 00:47:54.240
<v Speaker 2>And so there was some thought that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1187
00:47:54.340 --> 00:47:57.250
<v Speaker 2>how did that get there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did it naturally just float down there</v>

1188
00:47:57.251 --> 00:47:59.730
<v Speaker 2>and ended up on the sandbar and covered</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Santa.</v>

1189
00:47:59.740 --> 00:48:01.720
<v Speaker 2>Eventually was found by some kid that</v>
<v Speaker 2>was on a picnic.</v>

1190
00:48:02.620 --> 00:48:03.910
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1191
00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:08.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm wondering if that's slowly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how long would it take for you get</v>

1192
00:48:08.621 --> 00:48:11.350
<v Speaker 2>busted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was $200,000 back in the day,</v>

1193
00:48:11.970 --> 00:48:14.290
<v Speaker 2>a little bit here and there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now buy a bicycle.</v>

1194
00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:20.140
<v Speaker 2>Seems good by TV.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one saying nothing but bicycle.</v>

1195
00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:23.960
<v Speaker 2>These little kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know my way to California where the</v>

1196
00:48:23.970 --> 00:48:26.550
<v Speaker 2>weather's coming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>room's got a 50 inch tv with the fuck's</v>

1197
00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:29.650
<v Speaker 2>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't even have a job be what the</v>

1198
00:48:29.651 --> 00:48:32.260
<v Speaker 2>hell are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where did you get that transistor radio?</v>

1199
00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:33.610
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's a kid who found it,</v>

1200
00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:35.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure I see what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1201
00:48:35.490 --> 00:48:36.310
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1202
00:48:36.310 --> 00:48:39.030
<v Speaker 2>he reported the kid was with his family</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he reported finding Amelie.</v>

1203
00:48:39.130 --> 00:48:44.130
<v Speaker 2>That bureau went out there and dug up</v>
<v Speaker 2>the entire area and in a fairly large</v>

1204
00:48:44.201 --> 00:48:46.270
<v Speaker 2>effort trying to figure out what is</v>
<v Speaker 2>there more money there?</v>

1205
00:48:46.271 --> 00:48:48.200
<v Speaker 2>How did it get there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Run tests.</v>

1206
00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:50.140
<v Speaker 2>I think if they found his money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's dead.</v>

1207
00:48:50.770 --> 00:48:53.170
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to jump out of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>parachute and then leave the money.</v>

1208
00:48:53.171 --> 00:48:55.390
<v Speaker 2>There was some thought that maybe he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it as a ploy,</v>

1209
00:48:55.490 --> 00:48:56.350
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>To,</v>

1210
00:48:56.650 --> 00:48:58.840
<v Speaker 2>to kind of distract and think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1211
00:48:58.900 --> 00:49:01.740
<v Speaker 2>he's dead because the money's there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1212
00:49:01.770 --> 00:49:04.540
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it falls into the category of,</v>

1213
00:49:04.570 --> 00:49:05.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's never going to be resolved,</v>

1214
00:49:05.921 --> 00:49:07.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's a fascinating story.</v>

1215
00:49:07.781 --> 00:49:10.720
<v Speaker 2>It's Americans only on solved hijacking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Am I right about that?</v>

1216
00:49:10.721 --> 00:49:13.660
<v Speaker 2>I think Americans only unsolved does it</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the money.</v>

1217
00:49:13.661 --> 00:49:16.390
<v Speaker 2>Did they find all of it or what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just a small amount.</v>

1218
00:49:16.490 --> 00:49:17.860
<v Speaker 2>It was not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was not a large amount.</v>

1219
00:49:17.890 --> 00:49:19.480
<v Speaker 2>So he did not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he,</v>

1220
00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:23.140
<v Speaker 2>if he planted the theory was smart</v>
<v Speaker 2>enough not to put it all their weird</v>

1221
00:49:23.141 --> 00:49:25.600
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That db cooper one's a weird one because</v>

1222
00:49:25.601 --> 00:49:28.330
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they tend to look at him like some sort</v>

1223
00:49:28.331 --> 00:49:32.660
<v Speaker 2>of a folk hero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a connection with him that</v>

1224
00:49:32.670 --> 00:49:35.960
<v Speaker 2>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were thinking he was this guy who</v>

1225
00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:39.430
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to say shot family members and</v>

1226
00:49:39.431 --> 00:49:42.160
<v Speaker 2>murdered family members and then went</v>
<v Speaker 2>out and did that crime.</v>

1227
00:49:42.460 --> 00:49:47.460
<v Speaker 2>There was some suspect that was on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>loose from some sort of a homicide that</v>

1228
00:49:47.771 --> 00:49:51.130
<v Speaker 2>they connected to the DB cooper case and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they thought that somehow there was a</v>

1229
00:49:51.131 --> 00:49:53.800
<v Speaker 2>potential that they were related,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it was the same guy.</v>

1230
00:49:53.801 --> 00:49:55.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he loses some of his charm.</v>

1231
00:49:55.331 --> 00:49:56.700
<v Speaker 2>If that's the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1232
00:49:56.710 --> 00:49:58.210
<v Speaker 2>it'd be just a guy that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1233
00:49:58.300 --> 00:50:00.160
<v Speaker 2>thinking I'm going to hijack a plan for</v>
<v Speaker 2>some cash.</v>

1234
00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:03.340
<v Speaker 2>And where'd he get the money?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where did the cash come from?</v>

1235
00:50:03.370 --> 00:50:06.710
<v Speaker 2>They brought it on the plane and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>landed and then they gave him the money</v>

1236
00:50:06.711 --> 00:50:09.910
<v Speaker 2>that they got the passengers and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of the crew off of there.</v>

1237
00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:13.210
<v Speaker 2>And then everybody was in the cockpit</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the door closed when the,</v>

1238
00:50:13.310 --> 00:50:17.860
<v Speaker 2>in the old days in the back door would</v>
<v Speaker 2>open up the steps and he went out the</v>

1239
00:50:17.861 --> 00:50:19.420
<v Speaker 2>back door.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had a backdoor indicator,</v>

1240
00:50:19.450 --> 00:50:22.420
<v Speaker 2>which is how they kind of sensed about</v>
<v Speaker 2>where he would have gone out.</v>

1241
00:50:23.050 --> 00:50:24.610
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>

1242
00:50:24.611 --> 00:50:27.080
<v Speaker 2>I sound like a db cooper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how high was he up there when he</v>

1243
00:50:27.081 --> 00:50:29.620
<v Speaker 2>jumped</v>
<v Speaker 2>again?</v>

1244
00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:33.500
<v Speaker 2>I have to go through my notes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think commercial flight.</v>

1245
00:50:34.330 --> 00:50:34.821
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>

1246
00:50:34.821 --> 00:50:35.361
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1247
00:50:35.361 --> 00:50:35.721
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1248
00:50:35.721 --> 00:50:37.250
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they dropped down to,</v>

1249
00:50:37.790 --> 00:50:41.300
<v Speaker 2>I want to say about 10,000 feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember,</v>

1250
00:50:42.350 --> 00:50:44.390
<v Speaker 2>but they're not really sure because the</v>
<v Speaker 2>door came down.</v>

1251
00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:47.930
<v Speaker 2>He could've been there for any period of</v>
<v Speaker 2>time and he had instructed them to drop</v>

1252
00:50:47.931 --> 00:50:49.870
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget again what altitude he was</v>

1253
00:50:49.871 --> 00:50:50.750
<v Speaker 2>head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1254
00:50:50.751 --> 00:50:53.690
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing that these things continue</v>

1255
00:50:53.691 --> 00:50:58.190
<v Speaker 2>to go on and we love mysteries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love mysteries and conspiracies and</v>

1256
00:50:58.191 --> 00:51:00.620
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why the new trump</v>

1257
00:51:00.621 --> 00:51:02.540
<v Speaker 2>administration is so interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1258
00:51:02.541 --> 00:51:04.490
<v Speaker 2>he loves conspiracies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't he?</v>

1259
00:51:04.550 --> 00:51:08.390
<v Speaker 2>He believes a bunch of crazy ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he was just a retweet that one</v>

1260
00:51:08.391 --> 00:51:09.224
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1261
00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:11.050

<v Speaker 2>pigs.</v>

<v Speaker 2>the bullets in pig's blood.</v>

1264
00:51:15.300 --> 00:51:16.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there was never an attack,</v>

1265

<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Islamic attack at 35 years.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Know who?</v>

1267
00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:21.553
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>

1268
00:51:22.190 --> 00:51:23.960
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why aren't you doing this?</v>

1269
00:51:23.961 --> 00:51:26.280
<v Speaker 2>Why it just stop?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1271
00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:29.600
<v Speaker 2>there's no like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't vote for him.</v>

1272
00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:30.710
<v Speaker 2>I didn't vote for her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1273
00:51:31.390 --> 00:51:33.740
<v Speaker 2>I just thought we could have done better</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a country this size.</v>

1274
00:51:33.741 --> 00:51:35.600
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tell you one thing he's doing.</v>

1275
00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:40.040
<v Speaker 2>He's fucking it up for future idiots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Idiots.</v>

1276
00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:42.230
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1277
00:51:42.260 --> 00:51:45.680
<v Speaker 2>I would not underestimate our ability to</v>
<v Speaker 2>hire somebody worse.</v>

1278
00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:50.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm never going to be as someone like</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe there'll be like a new version of</v>

1279
00:51:50.721 --> 00:51:52.190
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like someone like him,</v>

1280
00:51:52.191 --> 00:51:54.100
<v Speaker 2>but they dial it back a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1281
00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:55.100
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe so.</v>

1282
00:51:55.101 --> 00:51:56.150
<v Speaker 2>I just think people always say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1283
00:51:56.151 --> 00:51:58.580
<v Speaker 2>this will be a course correction and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to go back to having really</v>

1284
00:51:58.581 --> 00:51:59.770
<v Speaker 2>respond and I'm thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1285
00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:00.920
<v Speaker 2>this is America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't,</v>

1286
00:52:01.310 --> 00:52:02.300
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>

1287
00:52:02.301 --> 00:52:04.730
<v Speaker 2>don't imagine that it could actually get</v>
<v Speaker 2>better in that regard.</v>

1288
00:52:04.731 --> 00:52:07.340
<v Speaker 2>We could be even more dysfunctional from</v>
<v Speaker 2>a political point of view,</v>

1289
00:52:07.341 --> 00:52:11.620
<v Speaker 2>but what's weird is I was watching this</v>
<v Speaker 2>interview today where this guy is</v>

1290
00:52:11.660 --> 00:52:16.660
<v Speaker 2>fucking pencil neck dork was supporting</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Tif of violence and saying that the</v>

1291
00:52:17.571 --> 00:52:20.360
<v Speaker 2>only way to fight against fascism is</v>
<v Speaker 2>violence.</v>

1292
00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:22.160
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh Jesus.</v>

1293
00:52:22.161 --> 00:52:25.010
<v Speaker 2>And then there was this other guy next</v>
<v Speaker 2>to him who was saying,</v>

1294
00:52:25.011 --> 00:52:26.630
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not true.</v>

1295
00:52:26.660 --> 00:52:30.170
<v Speaker 2>The way you fight it is with a peaceful</v>
<v Speaker 2>protest like just happened in Boston.</v>

1296
00:52:30.500 --> 00:52:32.360
<v Speaker 2>Like that's the best way to handle it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where there was,</v>

1297
00:52:32.810 --> 00:52:36.140
<v Speaker 2>I want to say there was more than</v>
<v Speaker 2>100,000 people in Boston wasn't there</v>

1298
00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:39.080
<v Speaker 2>was how many people in Boston came out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's see if we could find that out,</v>

1299
00:52:39.380 --> 00:52:41.210
<v Speaker 2>and it was completely peaceful in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>

1300
00:52:41.470 --> 00:52:45.380
<v Speaker 2>I think there was like 400 retards with</v>
<v Speaker 2>KKK banners.</v>

1301
00:52:45.700 --> 00:52:50.480
<v Speaker 2>It's a small,</v>
<v Speaker 2>small group of assholes and you're like,</v>

1302
00:52:50.481 --> 00:52:52.100
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but here's the thing.</v>

1303
00:52:52.101 --> 00:52:54.020
<v Speaker 2>This is where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is where the,</v>

1304
00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:55.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>president trump has just such a.</v>

1305
00:52:56.920 --> 00:52:58.520
<v Speaker 2>he's a great case study at some point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>

1306
00:52:58.540 --> 00:53:00.170
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure people are already,</v>

1307
00:53:00.210 --> 00:53:02.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>writing up their grant proposals to do a</v>

1308
00:53:02.751 --> 00:53:04.460
<v Speaker 2>study on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on his psychology.</v>

1309
00:53:04.461 --> 00:53:06.350
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look at,</v>

1310
00:53:07.700 --> 00:53:12.020
<v Speaker 2>you look at at the first amendment and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think if you like the first</v>

1311
00:53:12.021 --> 00:53:13.910
<v Speaker 2>amendment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you got to be all in,</v>

1312
00:53:13.940 --> 00:53:15.380
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like you can say,</v>

1313
00:53:15.390 --> 00:53:17.330
<v Speaker 2>and that's the kind of the beauty of</v>
<v Speaker 2>this country.</v>

1314
00:53:17.950 --> 00:53:21.500
<v Speaker 2>You got to let that a douchebag speak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1315
00:53:21.860 --> 00:53:23.660
<v Speaker 2>And that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's speech.</v>

1316
00:53:23.690 --> 00:53:26.160
<v Speaker 2>But we've gotten to the point now</v>

1317
00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:29.880
<v Speaker 3>words some by some folks are viewed as</v>
<v Speaker 3>violence.</v>

1318
00:53:30.180 --> 00:53:31.590
<v Speaker 3>Words aren't violence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think.</v>

1319
00:53:31.591 --> 00:53:33.570
<v Speaker 3>This is just my own personal opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boards on violence,</v>

1320
00:53:34.260 --> 00:53:37.500
<v Speaker 3>you gotta let everybody speak because</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the first amendment.</v>

1321
00:53:37.501 --> 00:53:38.580
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd go down and they don't want to</v>

1322
00:53:38.910 --> 00:53:41.160
<v Speaker 3>pick and choose in slope,</v>
<v Speaker 3>slippery slope.</v>

1323
00:53:41.190 --> 00:53:42.023
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1324
00:53:42.730 --> 00:53:44.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

1325
00:53:44.350 --> 00:53:47.520
<v Speaker 3>we can all agree that there is no space</v>
<v Speaker 3>for them.</v>

1326
00:53:47.521 --> 00:53:51.700
<v Speaker 3>They're assholes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's also no space for violent</v>

1327
00:53:53.100 --> 00:53:57.210
<v Speaker 3>counter demonstration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is space for protesting it because</v>

1328
00:53:57.211 --> 00:53:59.160
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're absolutely wrong.</v>

1329
00:53:59.220 --> 00:54:00.000
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1330
00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:01.620
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's again,</v>

1331
00:54:01.621 --> 00:54:05.190
<v Speaker 3>this idea that you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how you should be able to argue both,</v>

1332
00:54:05.230 --> 00:54:06.210
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1333
00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:09.270
<v Speaker 3>you can't respond with violence and yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you guys,</v>

1334
00:54:09.300 --> 00:54:11.370
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't be here.</v>

1335
00:54:11.870 --> 00:54:14.130
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to hold those views,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1336
00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:17.640
<v Speaker 3>it's important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You are protected by the first amendment</v>

1337
00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:22.760
<v Speaker 3>and so that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't mean we have to like it or in</v>

1338
00:54:23.491 --> 00:54:24.810
<v Speaker 3>any way condone it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1339
00:54:25.230 --> 00:54:28.740
<v Speaker 3>but you get an okay that those sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>fringe ideas are going to exist.</v>

1340
00:54:28.980 --> 00:54:32.970
<v Speaker 3>And I agree the best way to resolve it</v>
<v Speaker 3>is peaceful demonstrations,</v>

1341
00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:36.330
<v Speaker 3>massive pieces does demonstrations to</v>
<v Speaker 3>show,</v>

1342
00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:38.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of the weight of where the good</v>

1343
00:54:38.611 --> 00:54:42.810
<v Speaker 3>thoughts are and then a political</v>
<v Speaker 3>process,</v>

1344
00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:44.520
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And sure that,</v>

1345
00:54:44.910 --> 00:54:46.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>work through the political system as</v>

1346
00:54:46.471 --> 00:54:48.180
<v Speaker 3>dysfunctional as it may be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>

1347
00:54:48.490 --> 00:54:49.323
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1348
00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:54.450
<v Speaker 4>just encouraging people to violently</v>
<v Speaker 4>attack people that have differing ideas</v>

1349
00:54:54.451 --> 00:54:57.300
<v Speaker 4>in them that aren't being violent is</v>
<v Speaker 4>never the answer.</v>

1350
00:54:57.330 --> 00:54:59.190
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just not the way to do it.</v>

1351
00:54:59.210 --> 00:55:01.510
<v Speaker 4>And that's just the approach to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

1352
00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:05.270
<v Speaker 4>you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it takes a fascist approach.</v>

1353
00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:07.590
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean literally you're enforcing your</v>

1354
00:55:07.591 --> 00:55:10.380
<v Speaker 4>ideas to the point where you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>silencing others with actual violence.</v>

1355
00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:15.410
<v Speaker 3>The mark of a totalitarian state also is</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you say you can't have these views,</v>

1356
00:55:15.650 --> 00:55:19.220
<v Speaker 3>will get that to hate those views.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But again,</v>

1357
00:55:19.221 --> 00:55:21.650
<v Speaker 3>it's the idea that what you say is</v>
<v Speaker 3>violent to me.</v>

1358
00:55:21.860 --> 00:55:22.551
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not.</v>

1359
00:55:22.551 --> 00:55:25.250
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking speech.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other thing that trump fucked up,</v>

1360
00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:28.310
<v Speaker 3>he called those protesters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anti violent protesters.</v>

1361
00:55:28.340 --> 00:55:30.900
<v Speaker 3>Like anti-police protesters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1362
00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:31.920
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come on</v>

1363
00:55:31.980 --> 00:55:34.380
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is not what they're protesting</v>

1364
00:55:34.381 --> 00:55:38.220
<v Speaker 4>against police.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There might be a few amongst them that</v>

1365
00:55:38.221 --> 00:55:39.120
<v Speaker 4>say stupid shit.</v>

1366
00:55:39.880 --> 00:55:40.980
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but again,</v>

1367
00:55:40.981 --> 00:55:43.530
<v Speaker 3>just like with the other side where</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got what do you,</v>

1368
00:55:43.531 --> 00:55:44.600
<v Speaker 3>what do you got?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A $100,</v>

1369
00:55:44.601 --> 00:55:48.330
<v Speaker 3>$200.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who would imagine $15,000?</v>

1370
00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:50.730
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck are these Nazis hiding?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

1371
00:55:50.950 --> 00:55:51.810
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing.</v>

1372
00:55:52.410 --> 00:55:53.310
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my dad didn't,</v>

1373
00:55:53.430 --> 00:55:55.210
<v Speaker 3>didn't fly in World War Two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1374
00:55:55.380 --> 00:55:58.380
<v Speaker 3>so that somehow you could have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>resurgent,</v>

1375
00:55:58.381 --> 00:56:00.360
<v Speaker 3>not that there is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a small group just like</v>

1376
00:56:00.361 --> 00:56:05.010
<v Speaker 3>it's a small group on the left that</v>
<v Speaker 3>wants a violence solution to this or you</v>

1377
00:56:05.011 --> 00:56:07.290
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>honestly believes that violence against</v>

1378
00:56:07.350 --> 00:56:10.230
<v Speaker 3>police is somehow the answer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is insane.</v>

1379
00:56:10.231 --> 00:56:11.440
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1380
00:56:12.060 --> 00:56:12.960
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there you go.</v>

1381
00:56:13.050 --> 00:56:14.700
<v Speaker 3>Truth is somewhere in the middle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1382
00:56:15.060 --> 00:56:19.600
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've got to get rid of the fringe and</v>

1383
00:56:19.640 --> 00:56:22.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we got to figure out a way for the folks</v>

1384
00:56:22.951 --> 00:56:25.620
<v Speaker 3>that are in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Summoned space.</v>

1385
00:56:25.621 --> 00:56:26.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to work together.</v>

1386
00:56:27.540 --> 00:56:28.930
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean a,</v>

1387
00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:30.980
<v Speaker 3>I don't think the Democrats care whether</v>
<v Speaker 3>Republicans gave.</v>

1388
00:56:31.010 --> 00:56:31.990
<v Speaker 3>In fact they are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're happy.</v>

1389
00:56:31.991 --> 00:56:35.710
<v Speaker 3>That shit's not getting done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But as an American,</v>

1390
00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:37.780
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't vote for him.</v>

1391
00:56:37.781 --> 00:56:40.420
<v Speaker 3>I didn't vote for her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I would like to see the government</v>

1392
00:56:40.421 --> 00:56:41.920
<v Speaker 3>work now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who did you vote for?</v>

1393
00:56:42.430 --> 00:56:43.061
<v Speaker 3>A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>

1394
00:56:43.061 --> 00:56:43.810
<v Speaker 3>I just said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck it.</v>

1395
00:56:43.810 --> 00:56:45.450
<v Speaker 3>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't youtube.</v>

1396
00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:48.580
<v Speaker 3>I know I couldn't bring myself to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't bring us and I hated doing</v>

1397
00:56:48.581 --> 00:56:49.414
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1398
00:56:49.790 --> 00:56:52.840
<v Speaker 3>Because I voted top down right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they call it.</v>

1399
00:56:52.910 --> 00:56:53.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1400
00:56:53.550 --> 00:56:53.970
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1401
00:56:53.970 --> 00:56:55.020
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I did was I,</v>

1402
00:56:55.420 --> 00:56:57.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>state elections important,</v>

1403
00:56:57.941 --> 00:56:58.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those sort of.</v>

1404
00:56:58.570 --> 00:57:00.410
<v Speaker 3>And that's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it,</v>

1405
00:57:00.420 --> 00:57:00.860
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1406
00:57:00.860 --> 00:57:03.610
<v Speaker 3>it's very painful to say I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1407
00:57:03.900 --> 00:57:07.720
<v Speaker 3>can't justify doing that and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I know people and then people lose</v>

1408
00:57:07.721 --> 00:57:08.560
<v Speaker 3>their minds and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1409
00:57:08.561 --> 00:57:10.360
<v Speaker 3>that means you have voted for him or</v>
<v Speaker 3>that means.</v>

1410
00:57:10.700 --> 00:57:14.860
<v Speaker 3>And I know it just means we should have</v>
<v Speaker 3>been able to do better in a country this</v>

1411
00:57:14.861 --> 00:57:15.880
<v Speaker 3>size,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1412
00:57:16.060 --> 00:57:17.620
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1413
00:57:17.621 --> 00:57:21.130
<v Speaker 3>maybe maybe you hold your nose and vote</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the other side.</v>

1414
00:57:21.131 --> 00:57:22.540
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1415
00:57:22.660 --> 00:57:26.830
<v Speaker 3>but at least she represented a</v>
<v Speaker 3>conventional approach to politics.</v>

1416
00:57:26.890 --> 00:57:28.710
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no doubt about that.</v>

1417
00:57:28.750 --> 00:57:32.590
<v Speaker 3>That's super conventional.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't enjoy a lot of aspects of her</v>

1418
00:57:32.591 --> 00:57:37.450
<v Speaker 3>personality and what she's done with her</v>
<v Speaker 3>career and the obvious deception.</v>

1419
00:57:38.230 --> 00:57:42.610
<v Speaker 3>The Clinton Foundation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is just riddled with problems and</v>

1420
00:57:42.611 --> 00:57:47.240
<v Speaker 3>now doesn't even exist anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Apparently they shut it down to wonder</v>

1421
00:57:47.260 --> 00:57:52.260
<v Speaker 3>what they did with the remaining balance</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a horror is flying in from Russia.</v>

1422
00:57:54.070 --> 00:57:55.990
<v Speaker 3>What are we going to deal with this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got all this money.</v>

1423
00:57:55.991 --> 00:58:00.440
<v Speaker 3>We're got to transfer it somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's got to be a place to store it in</v>

1424
00:58:00.700 --> 00:58:05.700
<v Speaker 3>my pants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wad up hundreds stuff and I'm in his</v>

1425
00:58:07.070 --> 00:58:07.780
<v Speaker 3>past.</v>

1426
00:58:07.780 --> 00:58:09.850
<v Speaker 3>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was in a marriage or is.</v>

1427
00:58:09.851 --> 00:58:11.700
<v Speaker 3>I guess he's not dead yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I don't want to kill them off,</v>

1428
00:58:11.710 --> 00:58:12.543
<v Speaker 3>but he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

1429
00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:17.230
<v Speaker 3>he's an amazing political individual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That guy could make you think that,</v>

1430
00:58:17.290 --> 00:58:20.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I met him once overseas is sounds dodgy,</v>

1431
00:58:20.531 --> 00:58:25.531
<v Speaker 3>but in the Saudi at a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a party that does sound really sketching</v>

1432
00:58:26.610 --> 00:58:29.440
<v Speaker 3>and so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he had that ability right now again,</v>

1433
00:58:29.441 --> 00:58:30.470
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't a fan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

1434
00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:31.361
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1435
00:58:31.361 --> 00:58:34.030
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just want whichever administration</v>

1436
00:58:34.031 --> 00:58:36.640
<v Speaker 3>is in charge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want it to work you from country to</v>

1437
00:58:36.641 --> 00:58:38.000
<v Speaker 3>move forward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah.</v>

1438
00:58:38.230 --> 00:58:40.930
<v Speaker 3>But so you met him in it and it's true</v>
<v Speaker 3>what people used to say about them,</v>

1439
00:58:40.931 --> 00:58:45.820
<v Speaker 3>which is that he made you feel like he</v>
<v Speaker 3>was talking right to you and nothing</v>

1440
00:58:45.821 --> 00:58:47.050
<v Speaker 3>else was important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1441
00:58:47.051 --> 00:58:49.180
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't one of those guys that looks</v>
<v Speaker 3>over their shoulder thinking,</v>

1442
00:58:49.181 --> 00:58:53.800
<v Speaker 3>ms dot somebody else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should be talking to over there and he</v>

1443
00:58:53.801 --> 00:58:58.210
<v Speaker 3>was a charmer friend of mine told me he</v>
<v Speaker 3>was talking to him and a woman though</v>

1444
00:58:58.540 --> 00:59:03.540
<v Speaker 3>and Clinton like essentially almost</v>
<v Speaker 3>turned his back to him and like all the</v>

1445
00:59:04.210 --> 00:59:09.210
<v Speaker 3>horse out of the picture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then he just pressed gun.</v>

1446
00:59:09.790 --> 00:59:13.180
<v Speaker 3>I'm just gonna Block you right here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So these honors,</v>

1447
00:59:13.181 --> 00:59:17.830
<v Speaker 3>I got a stack name a pockets man in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>party.</v>

1448
00:59:18.110 --> 00:59:22.160
<v Speaker 3>A party in Saudi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get drunk</v>

1449
00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:23.210
<v Speaker 2>with that dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1450
00:59:24.250 --> 00:59:25.990
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you what's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean George Bush.</v>

1451
00:59:25.991 --> 00:59:28.880
<v Speaker 2>That'd be a guy like to sit down and</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a beer with the Bush family.</v>

1452
00:59:28.881 --> 00:59:30.080
<v Speaker 2>Good bunch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I know people that go,</v>

1453
00:59:30.110 --> 00:59:31.610
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't stand with policies.</v>

1454
00:59:31.611 --> 00:59:33.580
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes you just,</v>

1455
00:59:33.620 --> 00:59:35.510
<v Speaker 2>it comes down to a personal thing and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think,</v>

1456
00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:36.321
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1457
00:59:36.321 --> 00:59:38.300
<v Speaker 2>maybe the guy's got some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know you made.</v>

1458
00:59:38.301 --> 00:59:39.550
<v Speaker 2>I like his principles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You may have,</v>

1459
00:59:39.680 --> 00:59:41.100
<v Speaker 2>but he sticks with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1460
00:59:41.120 --> 00:59:43.630
<v Speaker 2>He looks extremely reasonable now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1461
00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:47.240
<v Speaker 2>exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One time where the supreme court had a</v>

1462
00:59:47.241 --> 00:59:50.870
<v Speaker 2>ruling that he didn't like and there was</v>
<v Speaker 2>a speech where he gave in the.</v>

1463
00:59:50.990 --> 00:59:54.350
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it quoted in print and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone showed a video of it,</v>

1464
00:59:54.650 --> 00:59:56.300
<v Speaker 2>but he was essentially saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1465
00:59:56.301 --> 00:59:58.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to uphold the decision of the</v>

1466
00:59:58.431 --> 00:59:59.110
<v Speaker 2>court,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1467
00:59:59.110 --> 01:00:01.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm not happy with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1468
01:00:01.491 --> 01:00:03.350
<v Speaker 2>this is uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way our system works.</v>

1469
01:00:03.350 --> 01:00:07.970
<v Speaker 2>And then it went to trump talking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>the supreme court,</v>

1470
01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:10.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not backing his travel ban and all the</v>

1471
01:00:10.641 --> 01:00:14.330
<v Speaker 2>different various things that he's lost</v>
<v Speaker 2>in court and he just goes out and he</v>

1472
01:00:14.331 --> 01:00:18.410
<v Speaker 2>just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I just like the personal attacks and</v>

1473
01:00:18.530 --> 01:00:21.080
<v Speaker 2>there's no product,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no discipline in the White</v>

1474
01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:21.271
<v Speaker 2>House.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1475
01:00:21.271 --> 01:00:22.850
<v Speaker 2>and I know that everybody thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1476
01:00:22.851 --> 01:00:24.940
<v Speaker 2>let's get something different in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's get a businessman.</v>

1477
01:00:24.941 --> 01:00:26.490
<v Speaker 2>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't want the politics as usual.</v>

1478
01:00:26.491 --> 01:00:29.930
<v Speaker 2>And well you got that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there is a requirement.</v>

1479
01:00:29.931 --> 01:00:33.980
<v Speaker 2>There is a need for the machine to work</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a certain fashion and in a sense.</v>

1480
01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:34.941
<v Speaker 2>And yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1481
01:00:34.941 --> 01:00:36.470
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's lots of things you can change</v>

1482
01:00:36.471 --> 01:00:38.840
<v Speaker 2>and that that's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There should be some change in the</v>

1483
01:00:39.050 --> 01:00:41.960
<v Speaker 2>government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the way the place works in</v>

1484
01:00:41.961 --> 01:00:44.840
<v Speaker 2>Washington,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the communications there that the</v>

1485
01:00:44.841 --> 01:00:46.700
<v Speaker 2>lack of discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean for crying out loud,</v>

1486
01:00:46.701 --> 01:00:48.590
<v Speaker 2>they just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just put in place the new</v>

1487
01:00:48.591 --> 01:00:50.120
<v Speaker 2>communications director at the White</v>
<v Speaker 2>House,</v>

1488
01:00:50.121 --> 01:00:51.050
<v Speaker 2>28 years old.</v>

1489
01:00:51.530 --> 01:00:53.870
<v Speaker 2>She's 28 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never done this sort of thing before.</v>

1490
01:00:54.140 --> 01:00:55.820
<v Speaker 2>And she's the new communications</v>
<v Speaker 2>director.</v>

1491
01:00:55.821 --> 01:00:59.000
<v Speaker 2>She replaced Scaramucci for his 10 days</v>
<v Speaker 2>of rain.</v>

1492
01:00:59.060 --> 01:01:00.390
<v Speaker 2>And why did she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1493
01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:02.090
<v Speaker 2>wanted to replace him?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because she listens.</v>

1494
01:01:02.210 --> 01:01:04.160
<v Speaker 2>She's just willing to do what trump</v>
<v Speaker 2>says.</v>

1495
01:01:04.161 --> 01:01:05.450
<v Speaker 2>He just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1496
01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:07.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm here for the job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1497
01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:09.090
<v Speaker 2>she says you're the girl for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1498
01:01:09.110 --> 01:01:10.010
<v Speaker 2>for this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she's,</v>

1499
01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:14.960
<v Speaker 2>she's worked within the trump</v>
<v Speaker 2>organization and I guess just viewed as</v>

1500
01:01:14.961 --> 01:01:15.980
<v Speaker 2>loyal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Loyal.</v>

1501
01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:17.021
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what he needs.</v>

1502
01:01:17.021 --> 01:01:19.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He needs loyalty above all else.</v>

1503
01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:20.353
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1504
01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:21.500
<v Speaker 2>so that's it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean,</v>

1505
01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:24.320
<v Speaker 2>there's no consistency and you see these</v>
<v Speaker 2>things happen.</v>

1506
01:01:24.321 --> 01:01:25.370
<v Speaker 2>You'll see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1507
01:01:25.590 --> 01:01:28.060
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the messaging get out and he gets ahead</v>

1508
01:01:28.070 --> 01:01:30.290
<v Speaker 2>of the message or they need to play</v>
<v Speaker 2>catch up then.</v>

1509
01:01:30.291 --> 01:01:34.340
<v Speaker 2>And people like Madison,</v>
<v Speaker 2>John Kelly now and Pompeo and others are</v>

1510
01:01:34.341 --> 01:01:39.341
<v Speaker 2>trying to race to make sense of some of</v>
<v Speaker 2>these things and they just self</v>

1511
01:01:39.381 --> 01:01:42.180
<v Speaker 2>inflicted wound after,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after wound for this,</v>

1512
01:01:42.210 --> 01:01:45.890
<v Speaker 2>this administration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems like one of those homemade</v>

1513
01:01:46.010 --> 01:01:48.800
<v Speaker 2>derby carts that they rolled down the</v>
<v Speaker 2>hill where you know,</v>

1514
01:01:48.801 --> 01:01:52.010
<v Speaker 2>the wheels aren't going to stay on and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you kinda can't look away.</v>

1515
01:01:52.010 --> 01:01:52.581
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1516
01:01:52.581 --> 01:01:55.520
<v Speaker 2>how long is it going to take for this</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing completely falls apart,</v>

1517
01:01:55.550 --> 01:01:57.620
<v Speaker 2>start doing tumbles down the hill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got a name,</v>

1518
01:01:57.621 --> 01:01:59.270
<v Speaker 2>they get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to come up with a name for that</v>

1519
01:01:59.271 --> 01:02:01.970
<v Speaker 2>cart is have the name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your soapbox derby cars.</v>

1520
01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:03.770
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1521
01:02:03.771 --> 01:02:04.360
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1522
01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:08.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't know where it's going to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think I'm the guy who has been in</v>

1523
01:02:08.901 --> 01:02:12.380
<v Speaker 2>the intelligence community for so many</v>
<v Speaker 2>years and you're stepping back and there</v>

1524
01:02:12.381 --> 01:02:16.910
<v Speaker 2>was also a real issue with him being at</v>
<v Speaker 2>odds with the intelligence community and</v>

1525
01:02:16.970 --> 01:02:19.350
<v Speaker 2>diminishing the intelligence community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1526
01:02:19.351 --> 01:02:21.780
<v Speaker 2>That was a strange error.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sort of an interesting narrative.</v>

1527
01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:26.560
<v Speaker 2>It didn't really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It got overblown to some degree.</v>

1528
01:02:26.561 --> 01:02:28.860
<v Speaker 2>I mean the people in the sense that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>people at the agency,</v>

1529
01:02:28.930 --> 01:02:30.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the end of the day,</v>

1530
01:02:30.481 --> 01:02:34.050
<v Speaker 2>they just take whoever's in charge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They take their marching orders from,</v>

1531
01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:34.560
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1532
01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:36.450
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I know people don't believe it</v>

1533
01:02:36.451 --> 01:02:38.790
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody likes to feature films and</v>

1534
01:02:38.791 --> 01:02:39.341
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

1535
01:02:39.341 --> 01:02:43.110
<v Speaker 2>it's a pretty apolitical organization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoever's in the administration,</v>

1536
01:02:43.111 --> 01:02:45.540
<v Speaker 2>they're going to prioritize their</v>
<v Speaker 2>national security concerns.</v>

1537
01:02:45.870 --> 01:02:50.070
<v Speaker 2>You're tasking comes out of that and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you just march on and do your job.</v>

1538
01:02:50.370 --> 01:02:53.750
<v Speaker 2>And yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the is an appointed position and you</v>

1539
01:02:53.751 --> 01:02:55.500
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>John Brennan was certainly much more</v>

1540
01:02:55.501 --> 01:02:57.180
<v Speaker 2>political in the previous administration</v>
<v Speaker 2>than,</v>

1541
01:02:57.210 --> 01:03:00.300
<v Speaker 2>than a previous directors have been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1542
01:03:00.530 --> 01:03:04.500
<v Speaker 2>and the operational level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the street level people just get on with</v>

1543
01:03:04.501 --> 01:03:04.891
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1544
01:03:04.891 --> 01:03:05.850
<v Speaker 2>they're human.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So of course,</v>

1545
01:03:05.851 --> 01:03:07.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they may have their own personal</v>

1546
01:03:07.231 --> 01:03:08.820
<v Speaker 2>preference,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I spent a long time.</v>

1547
01:03:09.420 --> 01:03:12.110
<v Speaker 2>They're in behind the curtain and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1548
01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:14.580
<v Speaker 2>they just tick on and do whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>

1549
01:03:14.581 --> 01:03:16.230
<v Speaker 2>There were people that weren't happy</v>
<v Speaker 2>with Obama.</v>

1550
01:03:16.231 --> 01:03:18.480
<v Speaker 2>There are people that weren't happy with</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bush to people not happy with trump.</v>

1551
01:03:18.510 --> 01:03:21.240
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't just tell us what the</v>
<v Speaker 2>priorities are,</v>

1552
01:03:21.340 --> 01:03:23.560
<v Speaker 2>tell us what the task is and we'll get</v>
<v Speaker 2>on with it,</v>

1553
01:03:23.620 --> 01:03:25.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go out there and do the collection</v>

1554
01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:31.280
<v Speaker 2>operations we're supposed to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just seems like there's no one person</v>

1555
01:03:31.621 --> 01:03:33.930
<v Speaker 2>that's ever going to be able to fill</v>
<v Speaker 2>that position.</v>

1556
01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:36.470
<v Speaker 2>It seems like that position also gets</v>
<v Speaker 2>bigger and bigger,</v>

1557
01:03:36.471 --> 01:03:39.190
<v Speaker 2>like the responsibilities get bigger and</v>
<v Speaker 2>bigger and the president's.</v>

1558
01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:39.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1559
01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:40.561
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

1560
01:03:40.561 --> 01:03:43.100
<v Speaker 2>it seems to me that at this point in</v>
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>

1561
01:03:43.290 --> 01:03:45.390
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our history,</v>

1562
01:03:45.450 --> 01:03:49.080
<v Speaker 2>the history of our society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we kind of have to look at that position</v>

1563
01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:53.430
<v Speaker 2>and wonder whether or not it's even</v>
<v Speaker 2>logical to give so much power to one</v>

1564
01:03:53.431 --> 01:03:54.710
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

1565
01:03:55.170 --> 01:03:55.951
<v Speaker 2>what would you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1566
01:03:55.951 --> 01:03:57.060
<v Speaker 2>how do you have a good question?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1567
01:03:57.061 --> 01:04:00.130
<v Speaker 2>How do you create a Council of Elders</v>
<v Speaker 2>Council?</v>

1568
01:04:02.460 --> 01:04:06.750
<v Speaker 2>Everybody sits around like a hand carved</v>
<v Speaker 2>desk in a underground layer and makes</v>

1569
01:04:06.751 --> 01:04:08.580
<v Speaker 2>decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good.</v>

1570
01:04:08.590 --> 01:04:09.301
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like it.</v>

1571
01:04:09.301 --> 01:04:10.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could be like the knights of the</v>

1572
01:04:10.771 --> 01:04:12.060
<v Speaker 2>round table,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's.</v>

1573
01:04:12.061 --> 01:04:12.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1574
01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:16.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think virtuous people by committee.</v>

1575
01:04:16.201 --> 01:04:17.610
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if the founding fathers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1576
01:04:17.611 --> 01:04:18.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there's been all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1577
01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:20.580
<v Speaker 2>reporting on that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just never read it,</v>

1578
01:04:20.581 --> 01:04:22.890
<v Speaker 2>but the founding fathers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have they considered that as an option,</v>

1579
01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:24.600
<v Speaker 2>as an option?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably not,</v>

1580
01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:28.470
<v Speaker 2>but a wonderful committee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The kind of population growth that we've</v>

1581
01:04:28.471 --> 01:04:30.480
<v Speaker 2>experienced here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the real problem with the founding</v>

1582
01:04:30.481 --> 01:04:33.600
<v Speaker 2>fathers is as brilliant as they were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no way that could have ever seen</v>

1583
01:04:33.601 --> 01:04:37.140
<v Speaker 2>the internet coming now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is what could they have seen</v>

1584
01:04:37.141 --> 01:04:39.930
<v Speaker 2>the people wanting to stay in Washington</v>
<v Speaker 2>for 36 years,</v>

1585
01:04:40.290 --> 01:04:42.450
<v Speaker 2>42 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've become career politicians.</v>

1586
01:04:42.450 --> 01:04:43.900
<v Speaker 2>They were all just interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1587
01:04:43.970 --> 01:04:45.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing their duty and serving the way</v>

1588
01:04:45.931 --> 01:04:48.510
<v Speaker 2>they were supposed to or they felt</v>
<v Speaker 2>obligated to and then getting the hell</v>

1589
01:04:48.511 --> 01:04:48.990
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1590
01:04:48.990 --> 01:04:52.410
<v Speaker 2>Getting back to the farm or whatever</v>
<v Speaker 2>that job was because nobody wanted to</v>

1591
01:04:52.411 --> 01:04:54.600
<v Speaker 2>stay in Washington for any longer than</v>
<v Speaker 2>they needed to.</v>

1592
01:04:54.660 --> 01:04:55.920
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

1593
01:04:55.921 --> 01:04:57.150
<v Speaker 2>They could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have foreseen all.</v>

1594
01:04:57.530 --> 01:04:58.470
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely not.</v>

1595
01:04:58.471 --> 01:05:01.740
<v Speaker 2>And so does that mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does that mean though?</v>

1596
01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:06.660
<v Speaker 2>It means amendments to the Constitution</v>
<v Speaker 2>and as we've done in the past and think</v>

1597
01:05:06.661 --> 01:05:11.661
<v Speaker 2>about how crazy it is that someone forms</v>
<v Speaker 2>a new country and then 400 plus years</v>

1598
01:05:13.291 --> 01:05:16.320
<v Speaker 2>later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is the preeminent superpower in the</v>

1599
01:05:16.321 --> 01:05:17.900
<v Speaker 2>world by far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1600
01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:20.350
<v Speaker 4>that's pretty crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got these countries that have been</v>

1601
01:05:20.351 --> 01:05:22.480
<v Speaker 4>around for thousands and thousands of</v>
<v Speaker 4>years,</v>

1602
01:05:22.870 --> 01:05:27.870
<v Speaker 4>like imagine a group of freaks and</v>
<v Speaker 4>misfits that branch off from America,</v>

1603
01:05:28.001 --> 01:05:32.050
<v Speaker 4>getting a boat and float over to Costa</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rica or wherever and take it over.</v>

1604
01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:33.070
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>

1605
01:05:33.070 --> 01:05:35.490
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then it becomes the superpower.</v>

1606
01:05:35.580 --> 01:05:36.780
<v Speaker 3>It is astounding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then again,</v>

1607
01:05:36.781 --> 01:05:39.390
<v Speaker 3>going back to what we talked about</v>
<v Speaker 3>towards the beginning was cobbling it</v>

1608
01:05:39.391 --> 01:05:43.230
<v Speaker 3>together and understanding that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>needed to get our hands on everything</v>

1609
01:05:43.231 --> 01:05:44.720
<v Speaker 3>west of the Mississippi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1610
01:05:44.970 --> 01:05:47.580
<v Speaker 3>clearly there were some issues there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

1611
01:05:47.610 --> 01:05:50.410
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of that vision that says we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>going all the way to the causeway.</v>

1612
01:05:50.460 --> 01:05:51.600
<v Speaker 3>The water we have to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

1613
01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:52.630
<v Speaker 3>we can control it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1614
01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:53.730
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1615
01:05:53.731 --> 01:05:54.450
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1616
01:05:54.450 --> 01:05:56.400
<v Speaker 3>it's an astounding history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're absolutely right.</v>

1617
01:05:56.460 --> 01:05:57.330
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1618
01:05:58.380 --> 01:06:00.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'll be interesting to see.</v>

1619
01:06:00.300 --> 01:06:03.030
<v Speaker 3>Obviously this is the probably the</v>
<v Speaker 3>stupidest statement people will hear it</v>

1620
01:06:03.031 --> 01:06:05.090
<v Speaker 3>all day is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is you know where we're going to be in</v>

1621
01:06:05.230 --> 01:06:08.820
<v Speaker 3>say another 200 years because I've got a</v>
<v Speaker 3>theory that says we're.</v>

1622
01:06:09.270 --> 01:06:13.470
<v Speaker 3>Every generation is making it easier for</v>
<v Speaker 3>their kids and eventually you hit a</v>

1623
01:06:13.471 --> 01:06:17.880
<v Speaker 3>point of diminishing returns and</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody's just a big pussy and so</v>

1624
01:06:17.970 --> 01:06:20.580
<v Speaker 3>that's my theory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't come up with a name for it.</v>

1625
01:06:20.581 --> 01:06:21.780
<v Speaker 3>You're not alone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1626
01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:23.900
<v Speaker 3>a big pussy pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>

1627
01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:26.690
<v Speaker 3>That could cover different things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah.</v>

1628
01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:30.450
<v Speaker 3>Plus that was great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was a great show.</v>

1629
01:06:30.550 --> 01:06:31.480
<v Speaker 4>Wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1630
01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:35.140
<v Speaker 4>I wonder how much there's going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are parts of the world where</v>

1631
01:06:35.141 --> 01:06:38.200
<v Speaker 4>obviously things are way more difficult</v>
<v Speaker 4>than are here and maybe we're losing</v>

1632
01:06:38.201 --> 01:06:43.090
<v Speaker 4>some sort of a competitive edge because</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've made our lives so easy and haven't</v>

1633
01:06:43.091 --> 01:06:48.091
<v Speaker 4>replaced the convenience of civilization</v>
<v Speaker 4>with something that tempers are human</v>

1634
01:06:49.481 --> 01:06:51.640
<v Speaker 4>instincts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like some difficult tasks,</v>

1635
01:06:51.790 --> 01:06:53.800
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of passage for young men,</v>

1636
01:06:54.090 --> 01:06:56.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something that develops character.</v>

1637
01:06:56.021 --> 01:07:00.130
<v Speaker 4>Instead we're making safe spaces and</v>
<v Speaker 4>making words,</v>

1638
01:07:00.131 --> 01:07:04.750
<v Speaker 4>violence and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>making it so we have trigger warnings</v>

1639
01:07:04.751 --> 01:07:05.190
<v Speaker 4>and</v>

1640
01:07:05.190 --> 01:07:07.450
<v Speaker 3>no winters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Winter when we don't have to,</v>

1641
01:07:07.460 --> 01:07:09.920
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thank God my kids are getting old enough</v>

1642
01:07:09.921 --> 01:07:11.510
<v Speaker 3>now where their sports leagues no</v>
<v Speaker 3>longer,</v>

1643
01:07:11.930 --> 01:07:14.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for awhile there I was just driving me</v>

1644
01:07:14.271 --> 01:07:16.610
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was parent go into a game and</v>

1645
01:07:16.670 --> 01:07:20.570
<v Speaker 3>realizing that they weren't keeping</v>
<v Speaker 3>score because they didn't want to hurt</v>

1646
01:07:20.571 --> 01:07:23.780
<v Speaker 3>anybody's feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the whole reason why people get</v>

1647
01:07:23.781 --> 01:07:24.920
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You fucked me.</v>

1648
01:07:24.930 --> 01:07:27.680
<v Speaker 3>And while the kids are keeping score,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the kids know for sure and kids don't</v>

1649
01:07:27.681 --> 01:07:29.420
<v Speaker 3>want you to blow smoke up their ass,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1650
01:07:29.421 --> 01:07:32.090
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'd come off the court and if you</v>

1651
01:07:32.091 --> 01:07:34.790
<v Speaker 3>know the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the oldest boy a scooter,</v>

1652
01:07:34.791 --> 01:07:37.310
<v Speaker 3>he 10 years old and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he plays a lot of Lacrosse.</v>

1653
01:07:37.311 --> 01:07:39.230
<v Speaker 3>He's been playing for five years and so</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

1654
01:07:39.500 --> 01:07:40.640
<v Speaker 3>he really likes it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he does.</v>

1655
01:07:40.670 --> 01:07:41.930
<v Speaker 3>He does well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

1656
01:07:41.931 --> 01:07:44.600
<v Speaker 3>I'm not raising the Division One</v>
<v Speaker 3>champion there,</v>

1657
01:07:44.601 --> 01:07:45.434
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1658
01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:48.730
<v Speaker 3>But he plays other sports too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's sort of a well roundedness</v>

1659
01:07:48.740 --> 01:07:50.750
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we came off the field one day and we</v>

1660
01:07:50.751 --> 01:07:52.800
<v Speaker 3>were walking along and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

1661
01:07:53.220 --> 01:07:53.511
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all,</v>

1662
01:07:53.511 --> 01:07:57.170
<v Speaker 3>the parents were kind of marching off</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the game was over and he says,</v>

1663
01:07:57.800 --> 01:07:58.401
<v Speaker 3>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how'd I do?</v>

1664
01:07:58.401 --> 01:07:59.234
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1665
01:07:59.270 --> 01:08:00.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could've done better.</v>

1666
01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:02.030
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

1667
01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:05.090
<v Speaker 3>I just get the impression you didn't try</v>
<v Speaker 3>as hard as you could,</v>

1668
01:08:05.300 --> 01:08:07.100
<v Speaker 3>what do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he looked at me,</v>

1669
01:08:07.430 --> 01:08:09.200
<v Speaker 3>irritated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He looked at me like,</v>

1670
01:08:09.201 --> 01:08:10.730
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe you didn't just say I</v>
<v Speaker 3>did great.</v>

1671
01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:14.540
<v Speaker 3>And so he said what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I looked at him,</v>

1672
01:08:14.541 --> 01:08:17.130
<v Speaker 3>I'm walking and I didn't realize the</v>
<v Speaker 3>parents were within earshot.</v>

1673
01:08:17.210 --> 01:08:17.920
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well look,</v>

1674
01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:18.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>school,</v>

1675
01:08:18.570 --> 01:08:20.210
<v Speaker 3>do you want me to blow smoke up your</v>
<v Speaker 3>ass?</v>

1676
01:08:20.250 --> 01:08:23.210
<v Speaker 3>Do you want me to be honest with you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And to his credit,</v>

1677
01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:25.490
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>be honest with me even though it wasn't</v>

1678
01:08:25.491 --> 01:08:26.570
<v Speaker 3>happy about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the honesty.</v>

1679
01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:29.040
<v Speaker 3>So you just be honest with me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we,</v>

1680
01:08:29.090 --> 01:08:31.970
<v Speaker 3>we tell kids that they know better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1681
01:08:31.971 --> 01:08:35.480
<v Speaker 3>if you tell a kid that they're great and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're doing wonderful and they didn't,</v>

1682
01:08:36.110 --> 01:08:39.140
<v Speaker 3>what do they take away from that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They take away from it that you're kind</v>

1683
01:08:39.141 --> 01:08:42.380
<v Speaker 3>of bullshitting them unless they're just</v>
<v Speaker 3>super,</v>

1684
01:08:42.381 --> 01:08:43.770
<v Speaker 3>super young.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're pretty.</v>

1685
01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:45.320
<v Speaker 3>They get it at a pretty early age.</v>

1686
01:08:45.650 --> 01:08:46.240
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's,</v>

1687
01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:50.950
<v Speaker 4>here's something that's important to</v>
<v Speaker 4>relate to children that you are not your</v>

1688
01:08:50.951 --> 01:08:52.900
<v Speaker 4>accomplishments.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You are you,</v>

1689
01:08:52.990 --> 01:08:57.400
<v Speaker 4>and the only way you're going to get</v>
<v Speaker 4>better at accomplishing things is to be</v>

1690
01:08:57.540 --> 01:09:02.170
<v Speaker 4>100 percent honest about the amount of</v>
<v Speaker 4>effort you put in and what the actual</v>

1691
01:09:02.171 --> 01:09:06.820
<v Speaker 4>result of that effort is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whether it's a failure or a success that</v>

1692
01:09:06.821 --> 01:09:10.570
<v Speaker 4>does not define you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that defines your participation in this</v>

1693
01:09:10.571 --> 01:09:12.700
<v Speaker 4>particular activity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is not you.</v>

1694
01:09:12.910 --> 01:09:16.630
<v Speaker 4>You are an individual that will</v>
<v Speaker 4>hopefully learn from all of your</v>

1695
01:09:16.631 --> 01:09:19.630
<v Speaker 4>endeavors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're never going to learn shit if</v>

1696
01:09:19.631 --> 01:09:22.360
<v Speaker 4>you lie to yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He never going to learn shit.</v>

1697
01:09:22.570 --> 01:09:26.050
<v Speaker 4>If somebody makes this nobody's scores</v>
<v Speaker 4>employment and there are no winners and</v>

1698
01:09:26.051 --> 01:09:30.770
<v Speaker 4>there are no losers and everybody's</v>
<v Speaker 4>amazing that that's not good because it</v>

1699
01:09:30.771 --> 01:09:31.511
<v Speaker 4>gives voice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>By the way,</v>

1700
01:09:31.511 --> 01:09:35.680
<v Speaker 4>it's not good because there's going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>be people out there that are fucking</v>

1701
01:09:35.681 --> 01:09:38.590
<v Speaker 4>driven and psychotic and they're going</v>
<v Speaker 4>to get ahead.</v>

1702
01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:42.430
<v Speaker 4>There's people that are task oriented</v>
<v Speaker 4>and goal oriented it and they they have</v>

1703
01:09:42.431 --> 01:09:45.760
<v Speaker 4>an idea ahead of them are going to try</v>
<v Speaker 4>to figure out how to make this happen.</v>

1704
01:09:45.910 --> 01:09:47.500
<v Speaker 4>They have a goal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they want to reach it,</v>

1705
01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:51.610
<v Speaker 4>and if you're competing with that person</v>
<v Speaker 4>in any form of life and they're not</v>

1706
01:09:51.611 --> 01:09:56.590
<v Speaker 4>burdened down by the bullshit that we</v>
<v Speaker 4>give so many kids today,</v>

1707
01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:59.980
<v Speaker 4>they're going to have a massive</v>
<v Speaker 4>advantage and this idea that this kid</v>

1708
01:09:59.981 --> 01:10:03.070
<v Speaker 4>who's been coddled and treated like he's</v>
<v Speaker 4>always going to be a winner,</v>

1709
01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:06.250
<v Speaker 4>that somehow or another they're going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>be happier is fucking crazy.</v>

1710
01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:11.920
<v Speaker 4>Kid can't process what's true and what's</v>
<v Speaker 4>not and the kid can't process criticism,</v>

1711
01:10:12.580 --> 01:10:13.830
<v Speaker 4>constructive criticism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1712
01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:15.430
<v Speaker 4>You don't just stand there and berate</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're kid.</v>

1713
01:10:15.431 --> 01:10:17.950
<v Speaker 4>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's just as bad as the other.</v>

1714
01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:18.280
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1715
01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:19.940
<v Speaker 4>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The guys that stand on it and</v>

1716
01:10:20.060 --> 01:10:20.910
<v Speaker 4>everybody's seen them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1717
01:10:20.950 --> 01:10:23.230
<v Speaker 4>That the Dads,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes moms that stayed on the</v>

1718
01:10:23.231 --> 01:10:27.490
<v Speaker 4>sideline and berate their kid because</v>
<v Speaker 4>kids jeopardizing his scholarship to</v>

1719
01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:29.050
<v Speaker 4>some more on school.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1720
01:10:29.140 --> 01:10:30.490
<v Speaker 4>morons,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but no,</v>

1721
01:10:30.610 --> 01:10:31.443
<v Speaker 4>I think</v>

1722
01:10:31.990 --> 01:10:33.400
<v Speaker 3>you're absolutely right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've got.</v>

1723
01:10:33.900 --> 01:10:38.400
<v Speaker 3>The sooner they're able to assess that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that equation effort,</v>

1724
01:10:38.650 --> 01:10:43.650
<v Speaker 3>a end result and compare it to what's</v>
<v Speaker 3>going on around them and then understand</v>

1725
01:10:44.791 --> 01:10:45.820
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna say what am I?</v>

1726
01:10:45.970 --> 01:10:47.640
<v Speaker 3>And then one of my boys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1727
01:10:47.641 --> 01:10:52.641
<v Speaker 3>they play basketball and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they enjoy it,</v>

1728
01:10:53.551 --> 01:10:55.920
<v Speaker 3>but it's not their primary activity</v>
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>

1729
01:10:56.310 --> 01:11:00.670
<v Speaker 3>So they tried out for a year and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>got and um,</v>

1730
01:11:00.780 --> 01:11:05.780
<v Speaker 3>but not at the top team and they were</v>
<v Speaker 3>upset about not being placed on this top</v>

1731
01:11:07.951 --> 01:11:09.390
<v Speaker 3>team.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

1732
01:11:09.391 --> 01:11:10.870
<v Speaker 3>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did.</v>

1733
01:11:10.871 --> 01:11:12.430
<v Speaker 3>And I didn't say it quite this way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but my,</v>

1734
01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:13.590
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my point was,</v>

1735
01:11:13.591 --> 01:11:14.190
<v Speaker 3>you don't deserve</v>

1736
01:11:14.190 --> 01:11:18.420
<v Speaker 2>to be on the top 10 because you're not</v>
<v Speaker 2>working as hard as those kids that are</v>

1737
01:11:18.421 --> 01:11:20.310
<v Speaker 2>working hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's their thing.</v>

1738
01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:23.040
<v Speaker 2>They wanted to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they put in the effort,</v>

1739
01:11:23.820 --> 01:11:26.670
<v Speaker 2>you are happy playing and you could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could be there,</v>

1740
01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:30.150
<v Speaker 2>but you're not doing it yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so therefore,</v>

1741
01:11:30.151 --> 01:11:31.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1742
01:11:31.201 --> 01:11:33.150
<v Speaker 2>don't get down on yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but b,</v>

1743
01:11:33.151 --> 01:11:36.090
<v Speaker 2>don't certainly don't get down on</v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody else because they put out the</v>

1744
01:11:36.091 --> 01:11:38.580
<v Speaker 2>effort and they accomplished something</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you didn't.</v>

1745
01:11:38.890 --> 01:11:42.240
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you always trying to find that balance.</v>

1746
01:11:42.241 --> 01:11:44.430
<v Speaker 2>It's just I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not doing our kids any favors</v>

1747
01:11:44.431 --> 01:11:45.340
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think we're,</v>

1748
01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:47.790
<v Speaker 2>we're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not obviously as a broad brush</v>

1749
01:11:47.791 --> 01:11:49.950
<v Speaker 2>statement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in general terms,</v>

1750
01:11:50.310 --> 01:11:54.810
<v Speaker 2>I think society is not doing us any</v>
<v Speaker 2>favors.</v>

1751
01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:59.070
<v Speaker 2>We're in and you see that I've got a</v>
<v Speaker 2>daughter that's in college and she talks</v>

1752
01:11:59.071 --> 01:11:59.850
<v Speaker 2>about her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1753
01:11:59.850 --> 01:12:04.440
<v Speaker 2>her classmates and others and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of the conversations they have in</v>

1754
01:12:04.441 --> 01:12:07.800
<v Speaker 2>class and the discussions and what</v>
<v Speaker 2>passes as debate nowadays,</v>

1755
01:12:07.801 --> 01:12:09.360
<v Speaker 2>which is not much right.</v>

1756
01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:11.400
<v Speaker 2>The idea of the old debate where you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can,</v>

1757
01:12:11.430 --> 01:12:14.610
<v Speaker 2>you can voice your opinions and they can</v>
<v Speaker 2>be different than somebody else's and</v>

1758
01:12:14.611 --> 01:12:17.460
<v Speaker 2>you can hash it out and you can have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>winner and a loser,</v>

1759
01:12:17.461 --> 01:12:19.500
<v Speaker 2>but that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You Go away and you come back the next</v>

1760
01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:22.980
<v Speaker 2>day and you have another rousing debate</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that class doesn't really exist.</v>

1761
01:12:23.270 --> 01:12:24.450
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems like anyway,</v>

1762
01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:28.680
<v Speaker 2>because everybody's so afraid of saying</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that might be offensive or not</v>

1763
01:12:28.681 --> 01:12:31.410
<v Speaker 2>offensive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just might be upsetting.</v>

1764
01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:34.320
<v Speaker 2>And there's a difference between being</v>
<v Speaker 2>upsetting and being offensive.</v>

1765
01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:37.890
<v Speaker 2>We're trying to serve the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that really was what we're trying</v>

1766
01:12:37.891 --> 01:12:40.860
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the hard edges that you might bruise</v>

1767
01:12:40.861 --> 01:12:42.040
<v Speaker 2>yourself on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're trying to push a,</v>

1768
01:12:42.130 --> 01:12:44.220
<v Speaker 2>put a cushion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you need to understand that when you</v>

1769
01:12:44.221 --> 01:12:47.070
<v Speaker 2>fall down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to hurt so that way next time</v>

1770
01:12:47.071 --> 01:12:50.280
<v Speaker 2>you're thinking you might fall down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll correct your path because the</v>

1771
01:12:50.281 --> 01:12:53.070
<v Speaker 2>whole reason why people do difficult</v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

1772
01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:55.590
<v Speaker 2>you do difficult things to understand</v>
<v Speaker 2>your boundaries,</v>

1773
01:12:55.591 --> 01:12:58.470
<v Speaker 2>to understand your limitations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then to try to improve those,</v>

1774
01:12:58.740 --> 01:13:01.200
<v Speaker 2>try to raise the roof on your</v>
<v Speaker 2>expectations,</v>

1775
01:13:01.201 --> 01:13:02.610
<v Speaker 2>raised the roof on your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

1776
01:13:02.670 --> 01:13:03.503
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1777
01:13:03.630 --> 01:13:07.050
<v Speaker 2>Limitations of your abilities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>learn from whatever those are and</v>

1778
01:13:07.051 --> 01:13:08.880
<v Speaker 2>improve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like interrogation training.</v>

1779
01:13:08.881 --> 01:13:11.670
<v Speaker 2>You would an interrogation training when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're working with people.</v>

1780
01:13:11.930 --> 01:13:15.630
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the goal is to show them that it's okay.</v>

1781
01:13:15.631 --> 01:13:17.370
<v Speaker 2>At some point they're going to have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk,</v>

1782
01:13:17.450 --> 01:13:20.460
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when you're going through the</v>

1783
01:13:20.461 --> 01:13:23.010
<v Speaker 2>training,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the point of it is to get them to that</v>

1784
01:13:23.011 --> 01:13:24.510
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They realized that,</v>

1785
01:13:24.511 --> 01:13:25.400
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1786
01:13:25.410 --> 01:13:28.050
<v Speaker 2>it's not the end of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that at some point I'm going to</v>

1787
01:13:28.051 --> 01:13:29.160
<v Speaker 2>end up talking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1788
01:13:29.260 --> 01:13:31.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to say something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have to do that because I</v>

1789
01:13:31.591 --> 01:13:33.810
<v Speaker 2>can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>otherwise I'm either dead or I'm</v>

1790
01:13:33.811 --> 01:13:37.170
<v Speaker 2>completely broken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the idea is if you do that and then</v>

1791
01:13:37.171 --> 01:13:38.760
<v Speaker 2>the rest of the training and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and beyond that,</v>

1792
01:13:38.761 --> 01:13:41.340
<v Speaker 2>you're building them back up because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they understand that now if,</v>

1793
01:13:41.490 --> 01:13:44.130
<v Speaker 2>God forbid something should happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get picked up and there's actually</v>

1794
01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:46.320
<v Speaker 2>an interrogation going on in the back of</v>
<v Speaker 2>their mind.</v>

1795
01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:50.130
<v Speaker 2>They understand that and they're able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>process it so that if they do get to</v>

1796
01:13:50.131 --> 01:13:51.960
<v Speaker 2>that point where now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1797
01:13:51.961 --> 01:13:54.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have to talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna have to come up with something</v>

1798
01:13:54.790 --> 01:13:57.030
<v Speaker 2>it's going to add.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it's not completely</v>

1799
01:13:57.031 --> 01:13:58.020
<v Speaker 2>devastating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't,</v>

1800
01:13:58.021 --> 01:14:00.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>leave them completely broken and they</v>

1801
01:14:00.151 --> 01:14:02.670
<v Speaker 2>can walk back because they understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to that point.</v>

1802
01:14:02.700 --> 01:14:04.660
<v Speaker 2>I understand what my boundaries are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1803
01:14:04.830 --> 01:14:06.160
<v Speaker 2>but I can work within that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1804
01:14:06.170 --> 01:14:07.970
<v Speaker 2>I don't know where I'm going with this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that we're seeing,</v>

1805
01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:09.900
<v Speaker 2>are you seeing turkeys and trading like</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

1806
01:14:09.901 --> 01:14:13.540
<v Speaker 2>an agent gets interrogated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>interrogation training in general for,</v>

1807
01:14:13.580 --> 01:14:15.400
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for our outfit,</v>

1808
01:14:15.401 --> 01:14:17.530
<v Speaker 2>for the military.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically the same.</v>

1809
01:14:17.531 --> 01:14:20.830
<v Speaker 2>We do a lot of cross training.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not interrogating an enemy</v>

1810
01:14:20.850 --> 01:14:24.580
<v Speaker 2>combatant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you being going through interrogation</v>

1811
01:14:24.581 --> 01:14:26.530
<v Speaker 2>training,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what do you tell them to do?</v>

1812
01:14:26.550 --> 01:14:29.260
<v Speaker 2>Like in that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like say if someone gets captured in</v>

1813
01:14:29.261 --> 01:14:32.920
<v Speaker 2>Afghanistan or whatever happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever bottom line is,</v>

1814
01:14:32.921 --> 01:14:33.491
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1815
01:14:33.491 --> 01:14:35.710
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you try to avoid talking,</v>

1816
01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:36.790
<v Speaker 2>but it depends.</v>

1817
01:14:36.790 --> 01:14:39.580
<v Speaker 2>Part of it is you've got to assess who</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're dealing with,</v>

1818
01:14:39.581 --> 01:14:40.900
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to assess what you think</v>

1819
01:14:40.910 --> 01:14:43.630
<v Speaker 2>their parameters are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What could be coming down the pike in</v>

1820
01:14:43.631 --> 01:14:45.880
<v Speaker 2>other words.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how is this and that.</v>

1821
01:14:45.881 --> 01:14:48.310
<v Speaker 2>That's part of the training too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is understanding what different groups</v>

1822
01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:50.920
<v Speaker 2>with different places could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could mean.</v>

1823
01:14:50.980 --> 01:14:53.200
<v Speaker 2>What would that would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that interrogation could look like,</v>

1824
01:14:53.201 --> 01:14:56.050
<v Speaker 2>how bad it could get?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're processing that.</v>

1825
01:14:56.320 --> 01:14:59.560
<v Speaker 2>Part of it is understanding what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's okay to give up.</v>

1826
01:14:59.561 --> 01:15:01.060
<v Speaker 2>What are you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you going to say that's not</v>

1827
01:15:01.061 --> 01:15:04.300
<v Speaker 2>going to put anything in jeopardy</v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody's lives or any operation or</v>

1828
01:15:04.301 --> 01:15:05.830
<v Speaker 2>anything in jeopardy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Part of it is,</v>

1829
01:15:05.860 --> 01:15:08.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've then you've got to understand</v>

1830
01:15:08.081 --> 01:15:09.910
<v Speaker 2>that you got to stay close to the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1831
01:15:09.940 --> 01:15:13.210
<v Speaker 2>The problem with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you know where you start getting</v>

1832
01:15:13.211 --> 01:15:17.050
<v Speaker 2>people out on interrogations is where</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can't remember what they've said</v>

1833
01:15:17.820 --> 01:15:20.680
<v Speaker 2>and the closer you are to the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the easier it is to remember what you've</v>

1834
01:15:20.681 --> 01:15:21.280
<v Speaker 2>said.</v>

1835
01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:23.350
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in these things,</v>

1836
01:15:23.351 --> 01:15:25.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's a bad situation and you're in</v>

1837
01:15:25.331 --> 01:15:27.730
<v Speaker 2>there day in and day out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1838
01:15:27.731 --> 01:15:32.200
<v Speaker 2>and your sleep deprivation and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>knocking around and there's no food and</v>

1839
01:15:32.201 --> 01:15:33.190
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna have,</v>

1840
01:15:33.250 --> 01:15:36.430
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna have a hard time keeping</v>
<v Speaker 2>track of even the basic things.</v>

1841
01:15:36.550 --> 01:15:38.500
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to keep it as close to the</v>

1842
01:15:38.501 --> 01:15:41.050
<v Speaker 2>truth as possible and as minimal as</v>
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>

1843
01:15:41.230 --> 01:15:42.030
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in terms of,</v>

1844
01:15:42.030 --> 01:15:43.420
<v Speaker 2>of damage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go in,</v>

1845
01:15:43.430 --> 01:15:45.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>typically you,</v>

1846
01:15:45.210 --> 01:15:47.290
<v Speaker 2>you've thought through all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like everything else,</v>

1847
01:15:47.291 --> 01:15:50.290
<v Speaker 2>you do your homework ahead of time and</v>
<v Speaker 2>God forbid something should happen and</v>

1848
01:15:50.370 --> 01:15:51.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>usually it won't.</v>

1849
01:15:51.281 --> 01:15:53.170
<v Speaker 2>But Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>point being is that,</v>

1850
01:15:53.230 --> 01:15:54.820
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1851
01:15:54.821 --> 01:15:58.450
<v Speaker 2>the ideas in the training portion of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want people to understand that,</v>

1852
01:15:58.560 --> 01:16:00.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's got a breaking point,</v>

1853
01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:01.570
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's just,</v>

1854
01:16:01.950 --> 01:16:03.060
<v Speaker 2>that's the way it works.</v>

1855
01:16:03.100 --> 01:16:04.810
<v Speaker 2>And someone's summits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1856
01:16:04.811 --> 01:16:05.370
<v Speaker 2>it's here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm,</v>

1857
01:16:05.370 --> 01:16:09.880
<v Speaker 2>it's further down the road,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but everybody's going to break and you</v>

1858
01:16:09.881 --> 01:16:12.820
<v Speaker 2>don't want that to devastate the person</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it should happen,</v>

1859
01:16:12.970 --> 01:16:14.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>knock on wood.</v>

1860
01:16:14.081 --> 01:16:16.660
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was apropos of nothing.</v>

1861
01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:17.673
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1862
01:16:17.730 --> 01:16:19.060
<v Speaker 2>it's important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1863
01:16:19.190 --> 01:16:24.190
<v Speaker 2>it's an interesting topic because a mean</v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding that there's going to be</v>

1864
01:16:25.151 --> 01:16:29.460
<v Speaker 2>severe penalties and that there's going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be repercussions there.</v>

1865
01:16:29.730 --> 01:16:31.240
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a,</v>

1866
01:16:31.241 --> 01:16:35.170
<v Speaker 2>this is a bad situation you're in and</v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding that going in is going to</v>

1867
01:16:35.171 --> 01:16:38.050
<v Speaker 2>help you a lot more than if you go in</v>
<v Speaker 2>there from,</v>

1868
01:16:38.070 --> 01:16:38.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a soft.</v>

1869
01:16:39.270 --> 01:16:42.280
<v Speaker 2>But how did world where you don't think</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be any adversity</v>

1870
01:16:42.281 --> 01:16:43.001
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1871
01:16:43.001 --> 01:16:44.590
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's all we're,</v>

1872
01:16:45.310 --> 01:16:46.160
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1873
01:16:46.810 --> 01:16:50.590
<v Speaker 2>just to finish that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a thought is that the interesting thing</v>

1874
01:16:50.591 --> 01:16:53.800
<v Speaker 2>about people talked about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>interrogation program that we had</v>

1875
01:16:53.801 --> 01:16:54.440
<v Speaker 2>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1876
01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:56.280
<v Speaker 2>And I don't want to revisit that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1877
01:16:56.760 --> 01:16:59.560
<v Speaker 2>the left at a very fine job of grabbing</v>
<v Speaker 2>the moral high ground and saying,</v>

1878
01:16:59.561 --> 01:17:01.720
<v Speaker 2>either you're talking to people or it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>all torture,</v>

1879
01:17:02.140 --> 01:17:03.030
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1880
01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:08.520
<v Speaker 2>but the point being is that even if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't ever intend to use any enhanced</v>

1881
01:17:09.621 --> 01:17:10.280
<v Speaker 2>interrogation</v>

1882
01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:15.110
<v Speaker 3>techniques,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to tell the enemy that</v>

1883
01:17:15.590 --> 01:17:20.590
<v Speaker 3>because once you tell them that you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>constrained by the army field manual as</v>

1884
01:17:22.371 --> 01:17:23.900
<v Speaker 3>an example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's all you can do.</v>

1885
01:17:24.350 --> 01:17:28.100
<v Speaker 3>Guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every milk out there fighting us and</v>

1886
01:17:28.101 --> 01:17:30.830
<v Speaker 3>wanting to harm us is carrying a copy of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the army field manual in their back</v>

1887
01:17:30.831 --> 01:17:31.480
<v Speaker 3>pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't,</v>

1888
01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:33.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>despite despite the fact that they did</v>

1889
01:17:33.621 --> 01:17:34.670
<v Speaker 3>for a while,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't live in a cave.</v>

1890
01:17:34.910 --> 01:17:39.770
<v Speaker 3>And so once they know what's coming down</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pike that's gone,</v>

1891
01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:43.310
<v Speaker 3>their incentive is gone right to talk to</v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

1892
01:17:43.460 --> 01:17:46.580
<v Speaker 3>Because once you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once you don't have that unknown,</v>

1893
01:17:46.581 --> 01:17:48.590
<v Speaker 3>if you're not sitting in some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1894
01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:53.000
<v Speaker 3>a squat box and the temperature's up and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you haven't eaten and you're thinking,</v>

1895
01:17:53.001 --> 01:17:55.910
<v Speaker 3>what the hell they got to do to me next?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have no idea.</v>

1896
01:17:56.720 --> 01:17:59.540
<v Speaker 3>If that's gone and you don't have that</v>
<v Speaker 3>anxiety,</v>

1897
01:17:59.541 --> 01:18:02.910
<v Speaker 3>that intense anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you're okay with it.</v>

1898
01:18:02.950 --> 01:18:04.450
<v Speaker 3>Mentally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get yourself to a nice happy.</v>

1899
01:18:04.830 --> 01:18:05.930
<v Speaker 4>You're comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're feeding,</v>

1900
01:18:05.931 --> 01:18:07.000
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're just asking you questions.</v>

1901
01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:08.630
<v Speaker 3>They're just asking questions and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

1902
01:18:08.631 --> 01:18:09.321
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can,</v>

1903
01:18:09.321 --> 01:18:13.160
<v Speaker 3>you can hold out for a much longer</v>
<v Speaker 3>period of time and yeah,</v>

1904
01:18:13.161 --> 01:18:16.190
<v Speaker 3>maybe there'll be some clever person</v>
<v Speaker 3>working in the interrogation facility</v>

1905
01:18:16.191 --> 01:18:18.590
<v Speaker 3>and they'll develop a personal</v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship over a period of time,</v>

1906
01:18:18.591 --> 01:18:19.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know what,</v>

1907
01:18:19.581 --> 01:18:22.490
<v Speaker 3>by then your operational information is</v>
<v Speaker 3>lost.</v>

1908
01:18:22.491 --> 01:18:23.450
<v Speaker 3>It's interest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1909
01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:28.070
<v Speaker 3>And the shelf life on that stuff is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is not particularly long typically.</v>

1910
01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:31.160
<v Speaker 3>So he had a way that says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1911
01:18:31.620 --> 01:18:33.660
<v Speaker 4>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're in a situation where you</v>

1912
01:18:33.661 --> 01:18:36.630
<v Speaker 4>have to extract information in a very</v>
<v Speaker 4>short period of time because it's</v>

1913
01:18:36.631 --> 01:18:41.390
<v Speaker 4>critical because lives are at stake,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like in taking time off and if you're</v>

1914
01:18:41.550 --> 01:18:45.600
<v Speaker 4>stuck in some situation where someone's</v>
<v Speaker 4>got a dirty bomb or what have you,</v>

1915
01:18:45.630 --> 01:18:47.490
<v Speaker 4>there's a terrorist attack is being</v>
<v Speaker 4>planned,</v>

1916
01:18:47.670 --> 01:18:49.440
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy has some information.</v>

1917
01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:51.390
<v Speaker 4>What is the best way to get it out of</v>
<v Speaker 4>them?</v>

1918
01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:53.010
<v Speaker 4>Is there a best way?</v>

1919
01:18:53.180 --> 01:18:54.440
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what does not really,</v>

1920
01:18:54.450 --> 01:18:57.440
<v Speaker 3>because it's all dependent on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>individual and that's where it's so much</v>

1921
01:18:57.441 --> 01:18:59.900
<v Speaker 3>of this and it just again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1922
01:18:59.910 --> 01:19:03.320
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the argument got sort of corrupted,</v>

1923
01:19:03.321 --> 01:19:04.160
<v Speaker 3>hijacked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

1924
01:19:04.550 --> 01:19:07.760
<v Speaker 3>Because of waterboarding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it just became such an emotive</v>

1925
01:19:07.820 --> 01:19:08.950
<v Speaker 3>issue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1926
01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:13.010
<v Speaker 3>but it's an enormously labor intensive</v>
<v Speaker 3>process.</v>

1927
01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:15.410
<v Speaker 3>Even in those cases where you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1928
01:19:15.411 --> 01:19:18.800
<v Speaker 3>we've just picked up a high value target</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we feel that they've got operational</v>

1929
01:19:18.801 --> 01:19:22.100
<v Speaker 3>information that we really need to know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1930
01:19:22.101 --> 01:19:24.340
<v Speaker 3>related to whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1931
01:19:24.830 --> 01:19:25.820
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1932
01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:28.550
<v Speaker 3>it's not as if you don't go in there and</v>
<v Speaker 3>start beating them over the head with a</v>

1933
01:19:28.551 --> 01:19:30.770
<v Speaker 3>two by four and nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody does that,</v>

1934
01:19:30.950 --> 01:19:31.783
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe some,</v>

1935
01:19:31.970 --> 01:19:33.860
<v Speaker 3>maybe some liaison partners,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1936
01:19:33.861 --> 01:19:34.370
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1937
01:19:34.370 --> 01:19:35.690
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1938
01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:37.440
<v Speaker 3>fourth world countries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1939
01:19:37.570 --> 01:19:41.360
<v Speaker 3>would world fifth world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the fifth world country?</v>

1940
01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:43.393
<v Speaker 3>I'd never even heard of that.</v>

1941
01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:47.240
<v Speaker 3>New Jersey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Connecticut,</v>

1942
01:19:47.450 --> 01:19:51.170
<v Speaker 3>Connecticut outside of Dan Malloy is the</v>
<v Speaker 3>president of the fifth World Nation of</v>

1943
01:19:51.171 --> 01:19:52.510
<v Speaker 3>Connecticut.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1944
01:19:52.700 --> 01:19:54.600
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1945
01:19:54.620 --> 01:19:56.210
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's down to the individual is knowing</v>

1946
01:19:56.211 --> 01:19:56.830
<v Speaker 3>your homework.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1947
01:19:56.830 --> 01:19:59.660
<v Speaker 3>it's having all the information that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can at your fingertips about,</v>

1948
01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:01.750
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well who is this person where the</v>

1949
01:20:01.751 --> 01:20:03.980
<v Speaker 3>associates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who else have we picked up and what have</v>

1950
01:20:04.010 --> 01:20:07.470
<v Speaker 3>they said up to this point?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you have anything like that that you</v>

1951
01:20:07.471 --> 01:20:10.920
<v Speaker 3>can walk into there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you walk into an interrogation and</v>

1952
01:20:10.921 --> 01:20:12.600
<v Speaker 3>you haven't done your homework,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're screwed,</v>

1953
01:20:12.690 --> 01:20:14.280
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to show out really quickly</v>

1954
01:20:14.281 --> 01:20:16.290
<v Speaker 3>and they're going to figure it out for</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most part.</v>

1955
01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:18.260
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not to say that there every detainee</v>

1956
01:20:18.300 --> 01:20:20.400
<v Speaker 3>would be a lex Luthor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

1957
01:20:20.401 --> 01:20:23.700
<v Speaker 3>they get a sense pretty quickly so you</v>
<v Speaker 3>really got to have it buttoned up,</v>

1958
01:20:23.701 --> 01:20:27.930
<v Speaker 3>have as much information as possible so</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you know how to direct the</v>

1959
01:20:27.931 --> 01:20:31.010
<v Speaker 3>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If anything is said at all,</v>

1960
01:20:31.030 --> 01:20:33.660
<v Speaker 3>volunteered at all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is there any credibility to it?</v>

1961
01:20:33.690 --> 01:20:35.730
<v Speaker 3>What can you do with that information?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can take it back and get it</v>

1962
01:20:35.731 --> 01:20:38.150
<v Speaker 3>corroborated by another series</v>

1963
01:20:38.180 --> 01:20:41.230

<v Speaker 4>And you'd be.</v>

1971
01:21:05.350 --> 01:21:08.060
<v Speaker 4>You'd be surprised.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's taking a series still listening to</v>

<v Speaker 4>I don't know why we didn't think about</v>

1996
01:21:59.811 --> 01:22:01.460
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it seems like it wouldn't work,</v>

1997
01:22:01.461 --> 01:22:03.970
<v Speaker 4>but you know why you haven't done that.</v>

<v Speaker 4>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm joking around the what that stuff</v>

2006
01:22:22.401 --> 01:22:26.010
<v Speaker 4>does is first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it kills all of your inhibitions are</v>

<v Speaker 4>And everybody,</v>

2011
01:22:39.980 --> 01:22:42.380
<v Speaker 4>if you could give that to enemy</v>
<v Speaker 4>combatants,</v>

2012
01:22:42.381 --> 01:22:45.020
<v Speaker 4>I guarantee you if you could talk to</v>
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>

2013
01:22:45.350 --> 01:22:48.020
<v Speaker 4>you would get shit out of them that they</v>
<v Speaker 4>would never want to discuss.</v>

2014
01:22:48.090 --> 01:22:49.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the</v>

2015
01:22:50.700 --> 01:22:55.700
<v Speaker 3>people will buy it when I say it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there are tremendous constraints on</v>

2016
01:22:56.220 --> 01:22:58.530
<v Speaker 3>what can and can't be done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If people had gone through and actually</v>

2017
01:22:58.531 --> 01:22:59.364
<v Speaker 3>read all those dog</v>

2018
01:22:59.430 --> 01:23:01.120
<v Speaker 4>memos that were released,</v>
<v Speaker 4>me and buddy.</v>

2019
01:23:01.121 --> 01:23:02.100
<v Speaker 4>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I'm talking about.</v>

2020
01:23:02.101 --> 01:23:07.060
<v Speaker 4>The chemist</v>
<v Speaker 4>coat on some fake glasses.</v>

2021
01:23:07.061 --> 01:23:08.770
<v Speaker 4>So I look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look smarter than I am.</v>

2022
01:23:10.070 --> 01:23:13.230
<v Speaker 4>Give me a stethoscope,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe liking club Gary.</v>

2023
01:23:13.240 --> 01:23:15.520
<v Speaker 4>Just show up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You take them out for a rave.</v>

2024
01:23:16.300 --> 01:23:18.640
<v Speaker 4>High water pants,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Italian shoes.</v>

2025
01:23:19.030 --> 01:23:21.580
<v Speaker 4>Now you're talking sort of the seventies</v>
<v Speaker 4>hustle.</v>

2026
01:23:21.640 --> 01:23:22.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just bring me in.</v>

2027
01:23:22.631 --> 01:23:23.890
<v Speaker 4>I'm telling you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just let me try it.</v>

2028
01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:28.060
<v Speaker 4>Once I could fix a lot of shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll put the idea forward.</v>

2029
01:23:28.090 --> 01:23:31.180
<v Speaker 4>I'll see what they say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then if you know the reason why they</v>

2030
01:23:31.181 --> 01:23:33.380
<v Speaker 4>don't think it would work because they</v>
<v Speaker 4>haven't done it yet.</v>

2031
01:23:33.460 --> 01:23:37.150
<v Speaker 4>If you get anybody in the viewer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anybody in the ca or wherever who has</v>

2032
01:23:37.151 --> 01:23:39.400
<v Speaker 4>done ecstasy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would listen to this and they would</v>

2033
01:23:39.401 --> 01:23:42.040
<v Speaker 4>not want to say they've done it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it'd be a real issue.</v>

2034
01:23:42.340 --> 01:23:43.420
<v Speaker 4>But if you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm telling you,</v>

2035
01:23:43.421 --> 01:23:47.260
<v Speaker 4>you give people two tabs of ecstasy and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then start asking them questions.</v>

2036
01:23:47.290 --> 01:23:49.240
<v Speaker 4>Plus also it would've been much happier</v>
<v Speaker 4>facility.</v>

2037
01:23:49.260 --> 01:23:51.350
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can you open the next day?</v>

2038
01:23:51.370 --> 01:23:53.260
<v Speaker 4>Not the next day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Next Day is rough.</v>

2039
01:23:53.530 --> 01:23:55.340
<v Speaker 4>He fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember the first time,</v>

2040
01:23:55.341 --> 01:23:58.090
<v Speaker 4>well I only did it once,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the next day I did it.</v>

2041
01:23:58.091 --> 01:24:01.390
<v Speaker 4>I quit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was in a coffee shop trying to read a</v>

2042
01:24:01.391 --> 01:24:04.210
<v Speaker 4>boxing magazine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I literally could not read.</v>

2043
01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:05.561
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>

2044
01:24:05.561 --> 01:24:08.260
<v Speaker 4>I can't even concentrate enough to read</v>
<v Speaker 4>a full sentence.</v>

2045
01:24:08.261 --> 01:24:12.250
<v Speaker 4>Like this is terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it was just pretty much that day</v>

2046
01:24:12.251 --> 01:24:13.030
<v Speaker 4>after.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2047
01:24:13.030 --> 01:24:15.880
<v Speaker 4>it's good to a couple of days.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That night I went onstage and I was</v>

2048
01:24:15.881 --> 01:24:18.910
<v Speaker 4>terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went on stage that night in Dallas.</v>

2049
01:24:18.911 --> 01:24:21.580
<v Speaker 4>If you went to that show back in 2001 or</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever it was.</v>

2050
01:24:21.581 --> 01:24:23.040
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I was apologizing.</v>

2051
01:24:23.390 --> 01:24:24.510
<v Speaker 4>Terrible show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2052
01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:25.630
<v Speaker 4>I just had no energy.</v>

2053
01:24:25.690 --> 01:24:30.160
<v Speaker 4>My brain was just like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I felt like my brain was a dry sponge.</v>

2054
01:24:30.161 --> 01:24:33.820
<v Speaker 4>Like someone had just squeezed all the</v>
<v Speaker 4>juice out of my brain.</v>

2055
01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:35.550
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See it says after effects,</v>

2056
01:24:35.551 --> 01:24:36.100
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2057
01:24:36.100 --> 01:24:39.040
<v Speaker 4>you're not worth it now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's ways out of that.</v>

2058
01:24:39.220 --> 01:24:40.840
<v Speaker 4>There's a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>just keep on it.</v>

2059
01:24:40.890 --> 01:24:42.550
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's nutrients that you take called</v>

2060
01:24:42.551 --> 01:24:45.700
<v Speaker 4>five htp.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Five htp actually converts.</v>

2061
01:24:45.701 --> 01:24:47.920
<v Speaker 4>The serotonin in your brain is the</v>
<v Speaker 4>building blocks for it,</v>

2062
01:24:47.921 --> 01:24:52.750
<v Speaker 4>so what you do is while you're tripping,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're supposed to double down on five</v>

2063
01:24:52.751 --> 01:24:56.250
<v Speaker 4>htp and it helps you as you come off of</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

2064
01:24:56.260 --> 01:24:58.130
<v Speaker 4>your serotonin jumps back up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2065
01:24:58.270 --> 01:25:01.810
<v Speaker 4>not 100 percent though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but to a manageable state,</v>

2066
01:25:01.910 --> 01:25:03.460
<v Speaker 4>who would.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You do have to be a chemist though to do</v>

2067
01:25:03.461 --> 01:25:04.120
<v Speaker 4>all that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2068
01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:06.490
<v Speaker 4>Just got to be discovered just by a</v>
<v Speaker 4>couple of tabs at the club,</v>

2069
01:25:06.810 --> 01:25:07.780
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>call it good,</v>

2070
01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:09.640
<v Speaker 4>but if you're really smart,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you actually take l,</v>

2071
01:25:09.670 --> 01:25:14.670
<v Speaker 4>Tryptophan and five htp because El</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tryptophan converts to five htp and you</v>

2072
01:25:15.131 --> 01:25:18.130
<v Speaker 4>should also take adaptogens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like some b vitamins and different</v>

2073
01:25:18.131 --> 01:25:18.730
<v Speaker 4>things as well.</v>

2074
01:25:18.730 --> 01:25:19.620
<v Speaker 4>That sense?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

2075
01:25:19.830 --> 01:25:20.770
<v Speaker 4>Is that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's in Turkey?</v>

2076
01:25:21.010 --> 01:25:21.843
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2077
01:25:21.940 --> 01:25:24.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you just have a Turkey club,</v>

2078
01:25:24.600 --> 01:25:29.410
<v Speaker 4>nice Turkey club.</v>
<v Speaker 4>While you're that apparently that's</v>

2079
01:25:29.411 --> 01:25:33.340
<v Speaker 4>bullshit that crashed that people we say</v>
<v Speaker 4>from Turkey that you know,</v>

2080
01:25:33.370 --> 01:25:36.340
<v Speaker 4>it puts you to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Apparently that's all just carbs.</v>

2081
01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:37.930
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that makes sense.</v>

2082
01:25:37.931 --> 01:25:40.390
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And massive amounts of mashed potatoes,</v>

2083
01:25:40.420 --> 01:25:44.200
<v Speaker 4>stuffing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just overeat and I can believe that.</v>

2084
01:25:44.260 --> 01:25:44.960
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2085
01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:47.020
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's happening right now.</v>

2089
01:25:52.091 --> 01:25:55.060
<v Speaker 4>They're hearing us listening to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>watch center.</v>

2090
01:25:55.120 --> 01:25:57.400
<v Speaker 4>They don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's only because they don't know</v>

2091
01:25:57.470 --> 01:25:59.400
<v Speaker 4>Langley there taking notes right now.</v>

<v Speaker 4>They're not going to die.</v>

2095
01:26:03.790 --> 01:26:04.040
<v Speaker 4>You might</v>

2096
01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:06.710
<v Speaker 2>have to change some laws to to get that</v>
<v Speaker 2>to happen.</v>

2097
01:26:06.711 --> 01:26:09.950
<v Speaker 2>Last fucking nose ain't bring me in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no laws.</v>

2098
01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:12.620
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I show up with a suitcase and a smile.</v>

01:26:24.021 --> 01:26:28.670
<v Speaker 2>I guarantee just someone that some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone who's not totally despicable,</v>

2103
01:26:28.671 --> 01:26:31.880
<v Speaker 2>like you just gotta like a little issue</v>
<v Speaker 2>with this guy talking.</v>

2104
01:26:32.390 --> 01:26:34.620
<v Speaker 2>It just changes your chemistry</v>
<v Speaker 2>immediate.</v>

2105
01:26:34.621 --> 01:26:37.370
<v Speaker 2>Just whittle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It will erase any inhibitions.</v>

2106
01:26:37.371 --> 01:26:39.950
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That sounds all very mengele like does,</v>

2107
01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:41.720
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't hurt anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>

2108
01:26:41.900 --> 01:26:43.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2109
01:26:43.251 --> 01:26:47.420
<v Speaker 2>I think right now people are losing</v>
<v Speaker 2>their minds because we got back on the.</v>

2110
01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:50.600
<v Speaker 2>The interrogation thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody thinks I thought that was over</v>

2111
01:26:50.601 --> 01:26:51.360
<v Speaker 2>and done with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2112
01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:53.490
<v Speaker 2>you on your side in the business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2113
01:26:53.750 --> 01:26:54.560
<v Speaker 2>just people in general.</v>

2114
01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:56.840
<v Speaker 2>I think everybody's just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People just got so tired of it.</v>

2115
01:26:58.160 --> 01:27:00.050
<v Speaker 2>Tired of the war on terror.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody wants to talk.</v>

2116
01:27:00.070 --> 01:27:01.400
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not that I want to talk about it,</v>

2117
01:27:01.401 --> 01:27:05.870
<v Speaker 2>but that's what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think where's the end where you</v>

2118
01:27:05.871 --> 01:27:06.321
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2119
01:27:06.321 --> 01:27:08.900
<v Speaker 2>and people just tired of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want to move on.</v>

2120
01:27:08.901 --> 01:27:13.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to think about it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>something happens and people are</v>

2121
01:27:13.161 --> 01:27:15.980
<v Speaker 2>reminded that it's still going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's still people out there that want</v>

2122
01:27:15.981 --> 01:27:18.800
<v Speaker 2>to hurt you and yet we're all just so</v>
<v Speaker 2>exhausted from it.</v>

2123
01:27:19.070 --> 01:27:20.360
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's also.</v>

2124
01:27:20.420 --> 01:27:21.020
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could,</v>

2125
01:27:21.020 --> 01:27:25.450
<v Speaker 2>you could make an analogy to some of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>stupid lies that trump has told that</v>

2126
01:27:25.470 --> 01:27:28.670
<v Speaker 2>tell so many lies that he just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't even be bothered.</v>

2127
01:27:28.671 --> 01:27:30.680
<v Speaker 2>This can't even be a scandal because</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's just,</v>

2128
01:27:30.681 --> 01:27:33.530
<v Speaker 2>there's so many of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just get overwhelmed by it to the</v>

2129
01:27:33.531 --> 01:27:34.460
<v Speaker 2>point where you can't even.</v>

2130
01:27:34.740 --> 01:27:36.710
<v Speaker 2>He can't process it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's exhausting.</v>

2131
01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:37.633
<v Speaker 2>It's exhausting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2132
01:27:37.660 --> 01:27:40.340
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea that it kind of works both</v>

2133
01:27:40.341 --> 01:27:40.851
<v Speaker 2>ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2134
01:27:40.851 --> 01:27:44.900
<v Speaker 2>It works in the sense that the tweets</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the bizarre statements and the</v>

2135
01:27:44.901 --> 01:27:46.790
<v Speaker 2>things are exhausting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then on the,</v>

2136
01:27:46.791 --> 01:27:48.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other side that people that want to</v>

2137
01:27:48.981 --> 01:27:52.100
<v Speaker 2>make all of that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the death of the republic every day,</v>

2138
01:27:52.101 --> 01:27:54.380
<v Speaker 2>it's the death of the republic that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>exhausting.</v>

2139
01:27:55.100 --> 01:27:57.860
<v Speaker 2>And you say who's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's running the shop,</v>

2140
01:27:57.861 --> 01:28:00.650
<v Speaker 2>who's keeping things moving forward?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know,</v>

2141
01:28:01.370 --> 01:28:01.851
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2142
01:28:01.851 --> 01:28:03.260
<v Speaker 2>we've got some good people in</v>
<v Speaker 2>governments,</v>

2143
01:28:03.300 --> 01:28:06.380
<v Speaker 2>really hardworking people for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trying to do the right thing.</v>

2144
01:28:06.680 --> 01:28:10.430
<v Speaker 2>And yet it's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

2145
01:28:10.431 --> 01:28:12.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm not particularly confident right</v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

2146
01:28:12.860 --> 01:28:14.990
<v Speaker 2>What do you think's the worst case</v>
<v Speaker 2>scenario right now?</v>

2147
01:28:16.100 --> 01:28:18.520
<v Speaker 2>So when you say you're not confident.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2148
01:28:18.590 --> 01:28:21.800
<v Speaker 2>well I think we could have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could see the market,</v>

2149
01:28:21.860 --> 01:28:23.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of stall at this point.</v>

2150
01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:25.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think people have been amazed at how</v>

2151
01:28:25.551 --> 01:28:28.340
<v Speaker 2>the market was resilient and not just</v>
<v Speaker 2>resilient,</v>

2152
01:28:28.341 --> 01:28:31.790
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a blasting upwards and showing</v>

2153
01:28:31.791 --> 01:28:34.000
<v Speaker 2>apparently no concern for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2154
01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:37.460
<v Speaker 2>how disheveled the administration has</v>
<v Speaker 2>been over the last several months has</v>

2155
01:28:37.461 --> 01:28:40.760
<v Speaker 2>been on a steady increase since 2007 or</v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

2156
01:28:40.840 --> 01:28:42.430
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the crash,</v>

2157
01:28:42.431 --> 01:28:43.190
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2158
01:28:43.190 --> 01:28:46.070
<v Speaker 2>But since that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>since the recovery of the long time,</v>

2159
01:28:46.100 --> 01:28:47.750
<v Speaker 2>it took a long time to come back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then.</v>

2160
01:28:47.751 --> 01:28:48.201
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2161
01:28:48.201 --> 01:28:49.034
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

2162
01:28:49.220 --> 01:28:51.470
<v Speaker 2>but what I'm talking about is the time</v>
<v Speaker 2>since the election,</v>

2163
01:28:51.770 --> 01:28:53.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the market's showed this ability to kind</v>

2164
01:28:53.691 --> 01:28:56.050
<v Speaker 2>of ignore what was happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2165
01:28:56.060 --> 01:29:01.060
<v Speaker 2>What was sort of the chaos that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>media is reporting on and encouraged</v>

2166
01:29:02.551 --> 01:29:06.240
<v Speaker 2>though by his remarks about business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to encourage tax cuts.</v>

2167
01:29:06.270 --> 01:29:07.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

2168
01:29:07.171 --> 01:29:07.821
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>

2169
01:29:07.821 --> 01:29:09.980
<v Speaker 2>and some of the deregulation which has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2170
01:29:10.050 --> 01:29:10.801
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be fair,</v>

2171
01:29:10.801 --> 01:29:13.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been a lot a fair amount of</v>

2172
01:29:13.321 --> 01:29:14.154
<v Speaker 2>deregulation.</v>

2173
01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:17.250
<v Speaker 2>Tax cuts not so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I think now that,</v>

2174
01:29:17.251 --> 01:29:18.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the market's starting to look at that</v>

2175
01:29:18.961 --> 01:29:21.170
<v Speaker 2>and think maybe we do have an issue</v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

2176
01:29:21.220 --> 01:29:22.370
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2177
01:29:22.410 --> 01:29:23.670
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to work out the way we</v>

2178
01:29:23.671 --> 01:29:25.710
<v Speaker 2>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so maybe that slows down.</v>

2179
01:29:25.711 --> 01:29:28.140
<v Speaker 2>I don't think North Korea is going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>watching any missiles.</v>

2180
01:29:28.141 --> 01:29:29.910
<v Speaker 2>They're not suicidal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2181
01:29:29.911 --> 01:29:32.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to see.</v>

2182
01:29:32.760 --> 01:29:36.470
<v Speaker 2>And Kim Jong Gun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the fuck's his name?</v>

2183
01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:38.520
<v Speaker 2>The basketball player with those shit</v>
<v Speaker 2>and his lips.</v>

2184
01:29:38.550 --> 01:29:42.840
<v Speaker 2>Rodman Rodman said Rodman over there</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a little Kim Yong.</v>

2185
01:29:42.890 --> 01:29:45.530
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I'm sad I can do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That.</v>

2186
01:29:45.540 --> 01:29:48.390
<v Speaker 2>Definitely does ecstasy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's that.</v>

2187
01:29:48.391 --> 01:29:50.790
<v Speaker 2>Now that I could get behind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an operation we could,</v>

2188
01:29:50.820 --> 01:29:55.260
<v Speaker 2>we could work on know because that's not</v>
<v Speaker 2>targeting detainees and then have all</v>

2189
01:29:55.270 --> 01:29:56.580
<v Speaker 2>those regulations we've got to worry</v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

2190
01:29:56.581 --> 01:29:57.840
<v Speaker 2>But I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2191
01:29:58.500 --> 01:29:59.630
<v Speaker 2>if Rodman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2192
01:29:59.730 --> 01:30:02.850
<v Speaker 2>willingly offers up ecstasy and Kim</v>
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>

2193
01:30:02.851 --> 01:30:05.520
<v Speaker 2>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's two consenting adults yet we</v>

2194
01:30:05.521 --> 01:30:07.440
<v Speaker 2>don't even allow Rodman to go back over</v>
<v Speaker 2>there anymore.</v>

2195
01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:08.320
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was.</v>

2196
01:30:08.321 --> 01:30:09.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that Americans aren't allowed to</v>

2197
01:30:09.751 --> 01:30:10.800
<v Speaker 2>go back there and now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now,</v>

2198
01:30:10.801 --> 01:30:12.600
<v Speaker 2>right now I suspect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although if Robin wanted to,</v>

2199
01:30:12.601 --> 01:30:14.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure he.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2200
01:30:14.110 --> 01:30:17.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's our answer to everything sent</v>

2201
01:30:17.800 --> 01:30:20.280
<v Speaker 2>Dennis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a hell of a ballplayer in his</v>

2202
01:30:20.280 --> 01:30:21.240
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People Forget.</v>

2203
01:30:21.241 --> 01:30:23.140
<v Speaker 2>People think Pacino.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's such an interesting cat,</v>

2204
01:30:23.670 --> 01:30:25.980
<v Speaker 2>but people forget what a great</v>
<v Speaker 2>basketball player he was.</v>

2205
01:30:26.190 --> 01:30:27.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just sort of went crazy.</v>

2206
01:30:27.960 --> 01:30:28.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2207
01:30:28.830 --> 01:30:31.350
<v Speaker 2>Look at them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember this picture?</v>

2208
01:30:31.590 --> 01:30:34.650
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bad as I want to be.</v>

2209
01:30:34.651 --> 01:30:37.470
<v Speaker 2>Was that a bookie or something?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2210
01:30:37.480 --> 01:30:40.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can't knock the guy for</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to be unique.</v>

2211
01:30:40.141 --> 01:30:40.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2212
01:30:40.830 --> 01:30:41.880
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's unique.</v>

2213
01:30:41.881 --> 01:30:43.080
<v Speaker 2>But he was again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

2214
01:30:43.310 --> 01:30:44.560
<v Speaker 2>he was a hell of a player.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2215
01:30:44.561 --> 01:30:47.460
<v Speaker 2>he definitely was mad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A good look.</v>

2216
01:30:47.461 --> 01:30:51.120
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen it one for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a jacket just like tropical jacket</v>

2217
01:30:51.121 --> 01:30:55.020
<v Speaker 2>with all the palm trees and what he said</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's wearing around his neck.</v>

2218
01:30:55.020 --> 01:30:57.720
<v Speaker 2>His had a fishing net or is that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could be anything</v>

2219
01:31:01.260 --> 01:31:04.620
<v Speaker 2>mad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a silver Mr t thing.</v>

2220
01:31:04.740 --> 01:31:06.090
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could look at that and say I could</v>

2221
01:31:06.091 --> 01:31:07.650
<v Speaker 2>never pull that off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could never.</v>

2222
01:31:08.040 --> 01:31:09.900
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't do that for Christmas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2223
01:31:10.320 --> 01:31:11.190
<v Speaker 2>Halloween,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not.</v>

2224
01:31:11.220 --> 01:31:14.390
<v Speaker 2>Not for Christmas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Had Christmas and and besides it</v>

2225
01:31:14.490 --> 01:31:16.580

<v Speaker 2>I put on my,</v>

2226
01:31:16.610 --> 01:31:21.510
<v Speaker 2>my handmade New York giants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sweater from my daughter and I don't</v>

2227
01:31:21.511 --> 01:31:24.140
<v Speaker 2>take it off until after the Christmas</v>
<v Speaker 2>season as well.</v>

2228
01:31:24.210 --> 01:31:24.991
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2229
01:31:24.991 --> 01:31:26.630

<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

2230
01:31:27.030 --> 01:31:29.840
<v Speaker 2>that's a great way to do that because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a giant.</v>

2231
01:31:30.130 --> 01:31:31.130
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2233
01:31:35.350 --> 01:31:38.430
<v Speaker 2>cling to the past.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Glories maybe</v>

2234
01:31:41.970 --> 01:31:43.890
<v Speaker 2>not in the government anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

<v Speaker 2>possibility of those days just.</v>

2237
01:31:49.120 --> 01:31:50.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless maybe I get older and I just,</v>

2238
01:31:51.430 --> 01:31:53.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to see kids just slipped out of</v>

01:31:53.821 --> 01:31:54.740
<v Speaker 2>tab,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2240
01:31:54.750 --> 01:31:57.210
<v Speaker 2>and see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told her to calm the fuck down.</v>

2241
01:31:57.240 --> 01:31:58.380
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2242
01:31:58.530 --> 01:31:59.970

<v Speaker 2>Not told</v>

2243
01:31:59.980 --> 01:32:00.551
<v Speaker 3>my kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2244
01:32:00.551 --> 01:32:01.660
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if things get bad,</v>

2245
01:32:01.661 --> 01:32:02.770
<v Speaker 3>if I start to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2246
01:32:02.771 --> 01:32:06.190
<v Speaker 3>I got blessed my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my mom's 98 and she's all there.</v>

2247
01:32:06.220 --> 01:32:08.110

<v Speaker 3>My Dad passed away when he was 90.</v>

2248
01:32:08.111 --> 01:32:11.620
<v Speaker 3>He was all there and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so I've got a knock on wood.</v>

2249
01:32:11.621 --> 01:32:13.660
<v Speaker 3>I'm hoping to make it a good long ways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

2250
01:32:15.930 --> 01:32:18.820
<v Speaker 3>I've also seen folks deal with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>problem of,</v>

2251
01:32:18.850 --> 01:32:21.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>onset dementia and Alzheimer's,</v>

2252
01:32:21.431 --> 01:32:23.770
<v Speaker 3>the problems that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that creates horrible things.</v>

2253
01:32:24.470 --> 01:32:28.010
<v Speaker 3>I told my kids that I haven't told them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I told the oldest one is just we'll</v>

2254
01:32:28.020 --> 01:32:30.710
<v Speaker 3>that out to the back and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you guys all take turns shooting abby</v>

2255
01:32:30.720 --> 01:32:34.210
<v Speaker 3>and whoever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoever wins gets the house.</v>

2256
01:32:34.900 --> 01:32:37.660
<v Speaker 3>So is that really what you told them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

2257
01:32:37.720 --> 01:32:38.553
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the oldest one.</v>

2258
01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:39.430
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shoot you.</v>

2259
01:32:39.910 --> 01:32:41.020
<v Speaker 3>He'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'll win my ways.</v>

2260
01:32:41.080 --> 01:32:42.070
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty good shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2261
01:32:42.071 --> 01:32:43.360
<v Speaker 3>But if then he'll go to jail.</v>

2262
01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:45.550
<v Speaker 3>You don't want that title.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ho sure.</v>

2263
01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:47.860
<v Speaker 3>There's some law on the books that says</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's okay to,</v>

2264
01:32:48.260 --> 01:32:49.190
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2265
01:32:49.410 --> 01:32:50.890
<v Speaker 3>that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're right.</v>

2266
01:32:51.010 --> 01:32:54.130
<v Speaker 3>Where do they have that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Assisted suicide is in California,</v>

2267
01:32:54.131 --> 01:32:55.780
<v Speaker 3>California,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think Oregon.</v>

2268
01:32:55.830 --> 01:32:59.590
<v Speaker 3>You posted something about Idaho,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about people that were going up there</v>

2269
01:32:59.591 --> 01:33:03.100
<v Speaker 3>for the eclipse and I retweeted it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was fucking hilarious from the</v>

<v Speaker 3>sheriff's department,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lincoln County sheriffs that that guy</v>

2271
01:33:06.850 --> 01:33:09.970
<v Speaker 3>knocked it out of the park because</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody was thinking the same thing.</v>

2272
01:33:09.971 --> 01:33:14.070
<v Speaker 3>Everybody was like it because literally</v>
<v Speaker 3>the hippies,</v>

2273

<v Speaker 3>maybe they're not hippie,</v>

2274
01:33:15.251 --> 01:33:16.031
<v Speaker 3>so I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not fair,</v>

2275
01:33:16.031 --> 01:33:18.020
<v Speaker 3>but let's call them hippies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2276
01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:19.210

<v Speaker 3>That field of freshly planted field</v>

2280
01:33:26.290 --> 01:33:27.130
<v Speaker 3>because it's not,</v>

<v Speaker 3>not everything is fenced and gate it out</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

2282

2289
01:33:44.561 --> 01:33:46.690
<v Speaker 3>tumble,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but don't go to pet them.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's their truck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you'll see that you'll see people,</v>

2292
01:33:51.130 --> 01:33:52.270
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get upset because,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I just got stopped.</v>

2307
01:34:23.951 --> 01:34:27.160
<v Speaker 3>I was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were up in the mountains and I was</v>

2308
01:34:27.161 --> 01:34:30.040
<v Speaker 3>racing to get to the airport on Sunday</v>
<v Speaker 3>yesterday.</v>

2309
01:34:30.130 --> 01:34:33.500
<v Speaker 3>And so I was coming through the canyon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2310
01:34:33.890 --> 01:34:38.890
<v Speaker 3>and hidden back into boise from up in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mountains and it's doing well.</v>

2311
01:34:39.220 --> 01:34:41.410
<v Speaker 3>I know what I was doing because the</v>
<v Speaker 3>sheriff told me what I was doing.</v>

2312
01:34:41.411 --> 01:34:44.670
<v Speaker 3>He stopped me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said even [inaudible] 76 and this is</v>

2313
01:34:44.780 --> 01:34:47.200
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a nasty ass canyon following the</v>

2314
01:34:47.201 --> 01:34:48.034
<v Speaker 3>river,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2315
01:34:48.510 --> 01:34:52.090

<v Speaker 3>you should be doing about 35,</v>

2316
01:34:52.091 --> 01:34:54.490

2318
01:34:56.411 --> 01:34:56.650
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

2319
01:34:56.650 --> 01:35:01.100
<v Speaker 3>And the sheriff was out because he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to catch hippies and he stopped</v>

2320
01:35:01.130 --> 01:35:02.780
<v Speaker 3>me and we had it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're just great.</v>

2321
01:35:02.781 --> 01:35:03.380
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you,</v>

2322
01:35:03.380 --> 01:35:06.290
<v Speaker 3>if you show them respect and implied,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a lot of places,</v>

2323
01:35:06.291 --> 01:35:07.240
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not just idle,</v>

2324
01:35:07.550 --> 01:35:09.380
<v Speaker 3>but the guy was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry what to gave you to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

<v Speaker 3>How's everything else?</v>

2327
01:35:13.381 --> 01:35:14.870
<v Speaker 3>And you end up chatting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>having a great time,</v>

2328
01:35:14.871 --> 01:35:17.210
<v Speaker 3>having a conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't mind getting the ticket and</v>

2329
01:35:18.160 --> 01:35:19.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bob's your uncle.</v>

2330
01:35:19.490 --> 01:35:21.800
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we just white privilege of showing.</v>

2331
01:35:21.860 --> 01:35:23.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what's happening right there.</v>

2332
01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:25.610
<v Speaker 3>Is that what's happening to a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 3>white privilege.</v>

2333
01:35:25.620 --> 01:35:26.660
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tammy?</v>

2334
01:35:26.770 --> 01:35:27.610
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

2335
01:35:27.620 --> 01:35:29.870
<v Speaker 3>that's probably,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's probably the case now.</v>

2336
01:35:29.871 --> 01:35:31.310
<v Speaker 3>I feel bad and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I'm gonna do?</v>

2337
01:35:31.311 --> 01:35:33.230
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to double what I sent in to</v>

2338
01:35:33.231 --> 01:35:35.690
<v Speaker 3>the county.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to pay twice the amount that I</v>

2339
01:35:35.691 --> 01:35:36.740
<v Speaker 3>should.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's nice.</v>

2340
01:35:36.741 --> 01:35:38.050
<v Speaker 3>Just so that I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2341
01:35:38.150 --> 01:35:41.790
<v Speaker 3>I self flagellate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2342
01:35:41.990 --> 01:35:44.240
<v Speaker 3>It's not like it's a hobby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most cops are great.</v>

2343
01:35:44.300 --> 01:35:45.140
<v Speaker 3>I've always said that.</v>

2344
01:35:45.180 --> 01:35:48.210
<v Speaker 4>I think that cops will look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most people,</v>

2345
01:35:48.240 --> 01:35:51.360
<v Speaker 4>most people you run into her fine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most people you run into a great,</v>

2346
01:35:51.600 --> 01:35:54.960
<v Speaker 4>occasionally you run into an asshole and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you have a problem and then you run</v>

2347
01:35:54.961 --> 01:35:56.730
<v Speaker 4>around going all people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're all assholes.</v>

2348
01:35:56.860 --> 01:35:59.010
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe one out of 100,</v>

2349
01:35:59.340 --> 01:36:02.940
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think with cops it's an insanely</v>

2350
01:36:02.941 --> 01:36:04.910
<v Speaker 4>difficult job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Insanely stressful.</v>

2351
01:36:04.980 --> 01:36:08.520
<v Speaker 3>And you see that video,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that one officer who was trying to get</v>

2352
01:36:08.521 --> 01:36:11.900
<v Speaker 3>that fellow to stop and he was wearing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was wearing a body camera and so he</v>

2353
01:36:11.901 --> 01:36:15.000
<v Speaker 3>had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had asked him to stop and he matched</v>

2354
01:36:15.001 --> 01:36:18.560
<v Speaker 3>the description of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think of robbery and um,</v>

2355
01:36:18.960 --> 01:36:20.820
<v Speaker 3>it's been on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's been on video of quite a bit.</v>

2356
01:36:20.880 --> 01:36:23.910
<v Speaker 3>And so the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the officer is trying to get him to stop</v>

2357
01:36:24.210 --> 01:36:25.590
<v Speaker 3>trying to him to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He won't stop.</v>

2358
01:36:25.591 --> 01:36:28.230
<v Speaker 3>He says I will tase you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's coming around.</v>

2359
01:36:28.231 --> 01:36:28.920
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So He's,</v>

2360
01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:30.570
<v Speaker 3>the guy won't be take his hand out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>his pocket.</v>

2361
01:36:30.571 --> 01:36:33.120
<v Speaker 3>And that's what the officer sees that</v>
<v Speaker 3>his hands in his pocket when he gets</v>

2362
01:36:33.170 --> 01:36:34.600
<v Speaker 3>kind of starts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2363
01:36:35.100 --> 01:36:40.100
<v Speaker 3>pie in that chart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are any kind of gets around and he</v>

2364
01:36:40.410 --> 01:36:42.480
<v Speaker 3>sees the hand and he starts saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take your hand out,</v>

2365
01:36:42.481 --> 01:36:44.400
<v Speaker 3>take your hand and take in its body</v>
<v Speaker 3>cameras running,</v>

2366
01:36:44.790 --> 01:36:49.260
<v Speaker 3>and the guy pulls out a weapon and shoot</v>
<v Speaker 3>him repeatedly and it's just,</v>

2367
01:36:49.261 --> 01:36:50.760
<v Speaker 3>it's all there on kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

2368
01:36:50.820 --> 01:36:54.600
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a perfect example of how difficult</v>

2369
01:36:54.601 --> 01:36:55.900
<v Speaker 3>that job can be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2370
01:36:55.901 --> 01:36:57.060
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's astounding.</v>

2371
01:36:57.210 --> 01:36:58.710
<v Speaker 3>So I know whether that video is</v>
<v Speaker 3>available.</v>

2372
01:36:58.850 --> 01:36:59.720
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is available.</v>

2373
01:36:59.721 --> 01:37:00.471
<v Speaker 4>I've seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2374
01:37:00.471 --> 01:37:01.640
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a bunch of those.</v>

2375
01:37:01.641 --> 01:37:04.070
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen one of them where a guy pulls</v>

2376
01:37:04.071 --> 01:37:08.450
<v Speaker 4>over this one man and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the guy was a Vietnam vet,</v>

2377
01:37:08.460 --> 01:37:10.050
<v Speaker 4>gets out of his car,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's got a rifle,</v>

2378
01:37:10.051 --> 01:37:11.510
<v Speaker 4>was yelling at him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get back to the car,</v>

2379
01:37:11.511 --> 01:37:13.160
<v Speaker 4>put the rifle down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>put the gun down,</v>

2380
01:37:13.161 --> 01:37:17.150
<v Speaker 4>and the guy starts shooting them and</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's shooting multiple rounds into the</v>

2381
01:37:17.151 --> 01:37:18.560
<v Speaker 4>guy's car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the guy started screaming.</v>

2382
01:37:18.561 --> 01:37:20.780
<v Speaker 4>Then he goes around by the passenger's</v>
<v Speaker 4>side and kills them.</v>

2383
01:37:20.840 --> 01:37:24.380
<v Speaker 4>It's all like on camera and video,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to realize this is a routine</v>

2384
01:37:24.381 --> 01:37:26.540
<v Speaker 4>traffic stop,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pulls them over for speeding or whatever</v>

2385
01:37:26.541 --> 01:37:28.190
<v Speaker 4>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this happens.</v>

2386
01:37:28.191 --> 01:37:31.640
<v Speaker 4>And it can happen all the time and</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's something that's on a cop's mind</v>

2387
01:37:31.670 --> 01:37:34.010
<v Speaker 4>every time he pulls somebody over and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you might think,</v>

2388
01:37:34.011 --> 01:37:35.330
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a good person,</v>

2389
01:37:35.331 --> 01:37:37.670
<v Speaker 4>I'm not doing anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I was going five miles an hour over</v>

2390
01:37:37.671 --> 01:37:38.840
<v Speaker 4>the speed limit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2391
01:37:38.841 --> 01:37:41.360
<v Speaker 4>why is this guy got his hand on his gun?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why this guy freaking out?</v>

2392
01:37:41.390 --> 01:37:44.510
<v Speaker 4>Well maybe watch that video now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe he's thinking about his kids,</v>

2393
01:37:44.660 --> 01:37:46.340
<v Speaker 4>maybe he's thinking about getting home</v>
<v Speaker 4>to his family.</v>

2394
01:37:46.341 --> 01:37:46.580
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

2395
01:37:46.580 --> 01:37:47.413
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's.</v>

2396
01:37:47.570 --> 01:37:49.010
<v Speaker 3>And there's nothing to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>

2397
01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:54.160
<v Speaker 3>this idea that you can't say two things</v>
<v Speaker 3>that some people might think,</v>

2398
01:37:54.231 --> 01:37:54.521
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2399
01:37:54.521 --> 01:37:56.150
<v Speaker 3>that counteracts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2400
01:37:56.160 --> 01:37:57.330
<v Speaker 3>anytime there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2401
01:37:57.331 --> 01:37:59.130
<v Speaker 3>a case of police brutality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>deal with it,</v>

2402
01:37:59.131 --> 01:38:02.610
<v Speaker 3>we got to deal with hard course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a terrible job.</v>

2403
01:38:02.640 --> 01:38:04.980
<v Speaker 3>It's a difficult job and it's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>dangerous job.</v>

2404
01:38:04.981 --> 01:38:08.640
<v Speaker 3>And those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those two statements can coexist.</v>

2405
01:38:08.810 --> 01:38:11.130
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's so you can support the</v>

2406
01:38:11.131 --> 01:38:15.330
<v Speaker 3>police and you can also support efforts</v>
<v Speaker 3>to stop police brutality wherever it</v>

2407
01:38:15.331 --> 01:38:20.331
<v Speaker 3>takes place and ensure that it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you can also support the police and</v>

2408
01:38:20.791 --> 01:38:23.340
<v Speaker 3>the difficult job they do and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>efforts that they try to make them,</v>

2409
01:38:23.420 --> 01:38:24.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>protect communities.</v>

2410
01:38:24.671 --> 01:38:25.270
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

2411
01:38:25.270 --> 01:38:26.440
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the last thing you want to do is</v>

2412
01:38:26.441 --> 01:38:29.200
<v Speaker 4>alienate them further.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mean that doesn't do anybody any good.</v>

2413
01:38:29.210 --> 01:38:32.560
<v Speaker 4>You denine the idea or the possibility</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are any good cops.</v>

2414
01:38:32.561 --> 01:38:35.740
<v Speaker 4>Well that's fucking crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's a really convenient thing for</v>

2415
01:38:35.741 --> 01:38:39.040
<v Speaker 4>people to say fuck the police because</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't get a lot of pushback.</v>

2416
01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:41.960
<v Speaker 4>Especially when something happens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't get a lot of pushback.</v>

2417
01:38:42.040 --> 01:38:42.790
<v Speaker 4>You look like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2418
01:38:42.790 --> 01:38:47.740
<v Speaker 4>you're some sort of a liberal hero.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a very slippery slope.</v>

2419
01:38:47.741 --> 01:38:49.980
<v Speaker 4>And the people that want no cops.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2420
01:38:49.981 --> 01:38:51.670
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well what about guns?</v>

2421
01:38:51.700 --> 01:38:53.830
<v Speaker 4>What are we going to do now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to just let criminals run</v>

2422
01:38:53.831 --> 01:38:54.664
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2423
01:38:54.790 --> 01:38:55.391
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

2424
01:38:55.391 --> 01:38:57.460
<v Speaker 4>The good people with their flowers are</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to take over</v>

2425
01:38:57.870 --> 01:38:59.430
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shit breaks down really quickly,</v>

2426
01:38:59.460 --> 01:39:02.820
<v Speaker 3>real quick and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>spend a long time overseas and some</v>

2427
01:39:02.821 --> 01:39:07.821
<v Speaker 3>pretty difficult environments and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>see sort of the worst nature of people</v>

2428
01:39:08.460 --> 01:39:09.590
<v Speaker 3>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2429
01:39:09.591 --> 01:39:11.250
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and again,</v>

2430
01:39:11.251 --> 01:39:13.060
<v Speaker 3>I agree with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think vast majority of people are</v>

2431
01:39:13.210 --> 01:39:13.801
<v Speaker 3>good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2432
01:39:13.801 --> 01:39:15.780
<v Speaker 3>they want to do good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want to do the right thing,</v>

2433
01:39:16.230 --> 01:39:18.780
<v Speaker 3>don't want conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most people don't want conflict,</v>

2434
01:39:18.810 --> 01:39:19.500
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2435
01:39:19.500 --> 01:39:20.130
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

2436
01:39:20.130 --> 01:39:25.130
<v Speaker 3>but things can break down and people can</v>
<v Speaker 3>do things that other folks that are</v>

2437
01:39:25.231 --> 01:39:27.360
<v Speaker 3>trying to do the right thing couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>even imagine.</v>

2438
01:39:27.780 --> 01:39:29.100
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2439
01:39:29.101 --> 01:39:29.600
<v Speaker 3>So anyway,</v>

2440
01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:30.890
<v Speaker 4>like shoot cops.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2441
01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:32.870
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you have to think I would never</v>

2442
01:39:32.871 --> 01:39:35.990
<v Speaker 4>shoot a cop wise's copy and so mean to</v>
<v Speaker 4>me because he doesn't fucking know you.</v>

2443
01:39:36.020 --> 01:39:36.830
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

2444
01:39:36.830 --> 01:39:38.210
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't know you.</v>

2445
01:39:38.211 --> 01:39:40.920
<v Speaker 4>You're doing something wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's pulling you over and you've got to</v>

2446
01:39:40.921 --> 01:39:45.470
<v Speaker 4>comply and be polite and calm sir.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And try to diffuse the situation and be</v>

2447
01:39:45.471 --> 01:39:47.540
<v Speaker 4>as friendly and as polite as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2448
01:39:47.770 --> 01:39:48.760
<v Speaker 3>And that's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>

2449
01:39:48.761 --> 01:39:49.920
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the same.</v>

2450
01:39:50.260 --> 01:39:52.960
<v Speaker 3>You can give your kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no matter who you are,</v>

2451
01:39:53.020 --> 01:39:55.420
<v Speaker 3>you can give your kid that same advice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

2452
01:39:55.750 --> 01:39:59.520
<v Speaker 3>the law enforcement has a difficult job</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

2453
01:40:00.190 --> 01:40:02.650
<v Speaker 3>so just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're stopped,</v>

2454
01:40:02.890 --> 01:40:04.990
<v Speaker 3>just comply,</v>
<v Speaker 3>comply.</v>

2455
01:40:05.180 --> 01:40:06.590
<v Speaker 3>Nobody's ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2456
01:40:06.700 --> 01:40:10.180
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just gotta you gotta be concise and</v>

2457
01:40:10.181 --> 01:40:13.240
<v Speaker 3>smart about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I tell my kids out and I try to</v>

2458
01:40:13.241 --> 01:40:17.560
<v Speaker 3>demonstrate by like when I stopped you</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the sheriff came up and you know,</v>

2459
01:40:17.561 --> 01:40:18.910
<v Speaker 3>my kids were in the car and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2460
01:40:19.090 --> 01:40:22.630
<v Speaker 3>I was polite and I was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he got to the window and I said,</v>

2461
01:40:22.631 --> 01:40:25.060
<v Speaker 3>I don't have any excuse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was racing to get to the airport.</v>

2462
01:40:25.061 --> 01:40:27.430
<v Speaker 3>I was speeding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know it and I have no excuse.</v>

2463
01:40:27.790 --> 01:40:31.390
<v Speaker 3>And that sets the tone immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he understands right now it helps</v>

2464
01:40:31.391 --> 01:40:32.920
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He looks in there and he sees a big dog</v>

2465
01:40:32.921 --> 01:40:36.430
<v Speaker 3>and the kids and everything and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>brings it down a little bit.</v>

2466
01:40:36.460 --> 01:40:38.000
<v Speaker 3>There's no doubt about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2467
01:40:38.040 --> 01:40:41.530
<v Speaker 3>and so other situations they might be</v>
<v Speaker 3>more on edge because they don't know.</v>

2468
01:40:41.590 --> 01:40:43.990
<v Speaker 3>They're not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

2469
01:40:43.991 --> 01:40:45.610
<v Speaker 3>so yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where there's problems,</v>

2470
01:40:45.611 --> 01:40:46.900
<v Speaker 3>deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got to take care of it,</v>

2471
01:40:47.240 --> 01:40:50.590
<v Speaker 3>but we can also acknowledge the fact</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the police have a damn difficult</v>

2472
01:40:50.591 --> 01:40:51.424
<v Speaker 3>job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2473
01:40:51.490 --> 01:40:54.160
<v Speaker 4>and it doesn't mean that there horrible</v>
<v Speaker 4>mistakes</v>

2474
01:40:54.160 --> 01:40:57.490
<v Speaker 2>and horrible cops and people that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>under pressure to do terrible things.</v>

2475
01:40:57.710 --> 01:40:59.260
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mean there's some videos of people that</v>

2476
01:40:59.261 --> 01:41:00.970
<v Speaker 2>compliance still get shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2477
01:41:01.030 --> 01:41:02.710
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a terrible tragedy.</v>

2478
01:41:02.770 --> 01:41:03.461
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

2479
01:41:03.461 --> 01:41:05.470
<v Speaker 2>They make mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They make mistakes or they had the wrong</v>

2480
01:41:05.471 --> 01:41:10.390
<v Speaker 2>mindset or they're not trained properly</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so their ptsd out and they're just</v>

2481
01:41:10.391 --> 01:41:12.550
<v Speaker 2>not designed for that job in the first</v>
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

2482
01:41:12.590 --> 01:41:13.390
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2483
01:41:13.390 --> 01:41:15.940
<v Speaker 2>it's very difficult to tell who's going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to crack under pressure.</v>

2484
01:41:15.970 --> 01:41:19.660
<v Speaker 2>The pressure of the day to day situation</v>
<v Speaker 2>that a lot of cops find themselves in.</v>

2485
01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:20.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2486
01:41:20.670 --> 01:41:21.503
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2487
01:41:22.080 --> 01:41:23.830
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the idea that you're right,</v>

2488
01:41:23.831 --> 01:41:26.850
<v Speaker 2>the idea that you'd remove law</v>
<v Speaker 2>enforcement and somehow we're all going</v>

2489
01:41:26.851 --> 01:41:30.610
<v Speaker 2>to live in a peaceful community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crazy anarchists driving me fucking</v>

2490
01:41:30.611 --> 01:41:31.230
<v Speaker 2>nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2491
01:41:31.230 --> 01:41:32.320
<v Speaker 2>We don't need laws,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2492
01:41:32.620 --> 01:41:37.620
<v Speaker 2>Shut your fucking mouth and get rid of</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the laws and universal basic income.</v>

2493
01:41:37.780 --> 01:41:41.170
<v Speaker 2>That's going to be a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what did we do out the guns?</v>

2494
01:41:41.171 --> 01:41:43.240
<v Speaker 2>We've gathered them up and melt them</v>
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>

2495
01:41:43.780 --> 01:41:46.240
<v Speaker 2>not mine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Make Martin Luther King Jr statues</v>

2496
01:41:46.241 --> 01:41:50.440
<v Speaker 2>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we know we were talking before the</v>

2497
01:41:50.441 --> 01:41:52.660
<v Speaker 2>podcast started about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2498
01:41:52.720 --> 01:41:53.800
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2499
01:41:53.830 --> 01:41:58.170
<v Speaker 2>what could possibly go wrong in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Afghanistan and that trump was</v>

2500
01:41:59.860 --> 01:42:02.920
<v Speaker 2>trump was going to make some sort of an</v>
<v Speaker 2>announcement and you were talking about</v>

2501
01:42:02.980 --> 01:42:06.190
<v Speaker 2>the idea of privatizing the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2502
01:42:06.191 --> 01:42:07.620
<v Speaker 2>the military over there and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2503
01:42:07.660 --> 01:42:11.230
<v Speaker 2>bringing in contractors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about it from the point of view</v>

2504
01:42:11.231 --> 01:42:12.310
<v Speaker 2>that I don't agree with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>

2505
01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:13.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2506
01:42:13.890 --> 01:42:14.431
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2507
01:42:14.431 --> 01:42:15.370
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2508
01:42:15.371 --> 01:42:17.170
<v Speaker 2>in terms of disclosure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

2509
01:42:17.171 --> 01:42:18.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my company intelligence,</v>

2510
01:42:18.251 --> 01:42:20.080
<v Speaker 2>we've got a security services group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2511
01:42:20.530 --> 01:42:24.370
<v Speaker 2>and starting back in 2003,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we started building up a fairly</v>

2512
01:42:24.371 --> 01:42:26.460
<v Speaker 2>significant presence out in Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right as,</v>

2513
01:42:26.461 --> 01:42:31.461
<v Speaker 2>as private contractors providing support</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the infrastructure operations that</v>

2514
01:42:31.721 --> 01:42:32.500
<v Speaker 2>were going on out there.</v>

2515
01:42:32.500 --> 01:42:36.490
<v Speaker 2>And what's the benefit of having a</v>
<v Speaker 2>private contractor for the military as</v>

2516
01:42:36.491 --> 01:42:38.470
<v Speaker 2>opposed to like military force at that</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

2517
01:42:38.471 --> 01:42:41.560
<v Speaker 2>Most of our work was actually for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>infrastructure companies,</v>

2518
01:42:41.590 --> 01:42:43.780
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the military is not providing</v>

2519
01:42:43.830 --> 01:42:46.960
<v Speaker 2>the support and they need the same level</v>
<v Speaker 2>of security and they have the burden is</v>

2520
01:42:46.961 --> 01:42:48.820
<v Speaker 2>building up some sort of a new business</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

2521
01:42:48.821 --> 01:42:51.010
<v Speaker 2>They would hire you guys to come in and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2522
01:42:51.040 --> 01:42:53.410
<v Speaker 2>And so that's an important effort</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>

2523
01:42:53.411 --> 01:42:56.560
<v Speaker 2>they need the same level of security</v>
<v Speaker 2>that a forward operating base or a</v>

2524
01:42:56.561 --> 01:42:59.110
<v Speaker 2>military base or facility would need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2525
01:42:59.111 --> 01:43:01.840
<v Speaker 2>but the military is not going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>allocate resources for a private</v>

2526
01:43:01.841 --> 01:43:04.000
<v Speaker 2>company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of what the private contractors</v>

2527
01:43:04.001 --> 01:43:05.790
<v Speaker 2>were doing was that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then also private contractors,</v>

2528
01:43:05.860 --> 01:43:09.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting contracts to provide additional</v>

2529
01:43:09.311 --> 01:43:12.710
<v Speaker 2>security support or logistical support</v>
<v Speaker 2>to uh,</v>

2530
01:43:12.730 --> 01:43:15.760
<v Speaker 2>the military to military facilities</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they can't,</v>

2531
01:43:16.130 --> 01:43:16.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2532
01:43:16.580 --> 01:43:21.070
<v Speaker 2>they can't afford to allocate resources</v>
<v Speaker 2>to perimeter security and to the degree</v>

2533
01:43:21.071 --> 01:43:21.640
<v Speaker 2>that they would like.</v>

2534
01:43:21.640 --> 01:43:25.480
<v Speaker 2>So private contractors come in and help</v>
<v Speaker 2>with that or providing support in the</v>

2535
01:43:25.481 --> 01:43:29.890
<v Speaker 2>movement of dignitaries or whatever may</v>
<v Speaker 2>be a point being is we're out there for,</v>

2536
01:43:29.920 --> 01:43:34.540
<v Speaker 2>for quite some time in Iraq doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we were there at the beginning of</v>

2537
01:43:34.541 --> 01:43:36.790
<v Speaker 2>sort of this private contractor thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2538
01:43:36.791 --> 01:43:39.460
<v Speaker 2>And people start becoming aware of it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we started working with groups</v>

2539
01:43:39.461 --> 01:43:44.350
<v Speaker 2>including a Erik prince is a group we</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't work directly with them,</v>

2540
01:43:44.351 --> 01:43:47.470
<v Speaker 2>but what I mean is the various groups</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are out there doing these contracts</v>

2541
01:43:47.471 --> 01:43:48.520
<v Speaker 2>and this work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2542
01:43:48.521 --> 01:43:51.920
<v Speaker 2>realizing that you needed to start to</v>
<v Speaker 2>form an association or started to get</v>

2543
01:43:51.921 --> 01:43:52.130
<v Speaker 2>some</v>

2544
01:43:52.130 --> 01:43:55.670
<v Speaker 3>sort of grip on how this thing would</v>
<v Speaker 3>look.</v>

2545
01:43:55.700 --> 01:43:57.380
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that there was some consistency</v>

2546
01:43:57.381 --> 01:43:59.780
<v Speaker 3>amongst training and what were the</v>
<v Speaker 3>regulations for,</v>

2547
01:43:59.960 --> 01:44:00.793
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2548
01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:02.410
<v Speaker 3>the various companies for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2549
01:44:02.470 --> 01:44:05.240
<v Speaker 3>weapons and everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's complicated,</v>

2550
01:44:05.241 --> 01:44:06.680
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>long story short is,</v>

2551
01:44:06.720 --> 01:44:08.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we had upwards of 400 people I guess out</v>

2552
01:44:08.961 --> 01:44:11.390
<v Speaker 3>there at a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at a point providing security and</v>

2553
01:44:11.480 --> 01:44:15.020
<v Speaker 3>intelligence support.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I've got some experience in this and</v>

2554
01:44:15.021 --> 01:44:20.021
<v Speaker 3>now what's happening with Afghanistan is</v>
<v Speaker 3>that one of the options that's been</v>

2555
01:44:20.841 --> 01:44:24.230
<v Speaker 3>being considered is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is handing over.</v>

2556
01:44:24.231 --> 01:44:27.860
<v Speaker 3>We've got about an 8,400 troops out</v>
<v Speaker 3>there right now doing mostly training</v>

2557
01:44:27.890 --> 01:44:30.230
<v Speaker 3>missions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>training operations and support for the</v>

2558
01:44:30.231 --> 01:44:32.420
<v Speaker 3>Afghan troops.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the idea was,</v>

2559
01:44:33.010 --> 01:44:35.240
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's let the private contractor take</v>

2560
01:44:35.241 --> 01:44:36.260
<v Speaker 3>that over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's,</v>

2561
01:44:36.290 --> 01:44:38.720
<v Speaker 3>let's move that out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And let's not have the brave men and</v>

2562
01:44:38.721 --> 01:44:43.070
<v Speaker 3>women of the US military engaged in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Afghanistan ad Nauseum,</v>

2563
01:44:43.380 --> 01:44:45.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this idea is being pushed to some</v>

2564
01:44:45.351 --> 01:44:46.790
<v Speaker 3>degree by Erik Prince,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2565
01:44:46.791 --> 01:44:48.980
<v Speaker 3>and he's said things like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2566
01:44:48.981 --> 01:44:49.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

2567
01:44:49.320 --> 01:44:51.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you want to keep having this</v>

2568
01:44:51.111 --> 01:44:52.670
<v Speaker 3>conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to have the conversation 10</v>

2569
01:44:52.671 --> 01:44:54.830
<v Speaker 3>years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Friday the military keep doing it,</v>

2570
01:44:54.860 --> 01:44:56.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or we can be more,</v>

2571
01:44:56.150 --> 01:44:58.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somehow efficient.</v>

2572
01:44:58.570 --> 01:45:01.880
<v Speaker 3>And they explained that people who Eric</v>
<v Speaker 3>Princes from Blackwater,</v>

2573
01:45:01.881 --> 01:45:03.530
<v Speaker 3>blackwater and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he came out of a,</v>

2574
01:45:03.580 --> 01:45:06.500
<v Speaker 3>of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a wealthy Michigan based family.</v>

2575
01:45:06.501 --> 01:45:09.800
<v Speaker 3>Betsy devoss the cat or the education</v>
<v Speaker 3>secretary is a sister in the current</v>

2576
01:45:09.801 --> 01:45:13.570
<v Speaker 3>administration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so he started water and you know,</v>

2577
01:45:13.580 --> 01:45:14.401
<v Speaker 3>they uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2578
01:45:14.401 --> 01:45:17.200
<v Speaker 3>they became sort of the face of right</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they,</v>

2579
01:45:17.230 --> 01:45:18.410
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they did very well.</v>

2580
01:45:18.411 --> 01:45:20.690
<v Speaker 3>It's a private contractor business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They got good contracts and that was</v>

2581
01:45:20.691 --> 01:45:22.760
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had some issues and some problems.</v>

2582
01:45:22.761 --> 01:45:24.500
<v Speaker 3>A very controversial,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very controversial.</v>

2583
01:45:24.501 --> 01:45:26.270
<v Speaker 3>They sold the business,</v>
<v Speaker 3>renamed it,</v>

2584
01:45:26.320 --> 01:45:27.500
<v Speaker 3>then renamed it again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Yada,</v>

2585
01:45:27.501 --> 01:45:30.410
<v Speaker 3>Yada Yada.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the point being is that the idea</v>

2586
01:45:30.411 --> 01:45:34.730
<v Speaker 3>that somehow you're going to prioritize</v>
<v Speaker 3>this operation in Afghanistan expecting</v>

2587
01:45:34.731 --> 01:45:36.830
<v Speaker 3>then I guess here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

2588
01:45:36.831 --> 01:45:37.431
<v Speaker 3>because he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2589
01:45:37.431 --> 01:45:40.400
<v Speaker 3>it'd be about $10,000,000,000 a year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which would be a savings on what we</v>

2590
01:45:40.401 --> 01:45:43.550
<v Speaker 3>spend now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You give private contractors,</v>

2591
01:45:43.570 --> 01:45:43.901
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2592
01:45:43.901 --> 01:45:46.520
<v Speaker 3>a $10,000,000,000 trough to eat at.</v>

2593
01:45:46.550 --> 01:45:48.410
<v Speaker 3>You think they're going to end it</v>
<v Speaker 3>anytime soon,</v>

2594
01:45:48.780 --> 01:45:52.610
<v Speaker 3>there's no fucking way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if we want this thing to just drag on</v>

2595
01:45:52.611 --> 01:45:54.200
<v Speaker 3>ad Nauseum,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fine,</v>

2596
01:45:54.230 --> 01:45:58.280
<v Speaker 3>privatized it and put that profit motive</v>
<v Speaker 3>up there and you think somehow it's not</v>

2597
01:45:58.281 --> 01:46:00.980
<v Speaker 3>going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I can ever to say that as a private</v>

2598
01:46:00.981 --> 01:46:03.020
<v Speaker 3>contractor in that had been involved in</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2599
01:46:03.320 --> 01:46:04.430
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I appreciate your honesty.</v>

2600
01:46:04.660 --> 01:46:05.930
<v Speaker 3>Not I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

2601
01:46:06.020 --> 01:46:08.840
<v Speaker 3>it's the wrong thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if not top of that,</v>

2602
01:46:08.841 --> 01:46:10.430
<v Speaker 3>if I guess the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2603
01:46:10.431 --> 01:46:14.510
<v Speaker 3>the overlying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the 30,000 foot view that I've got is</v>

2604
01:46:14.511 --> 01:46:17.660
<v Speaker 3>that if it's important enough for us to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be there,</v>

2605
01:46:17.930 --> 01:46:20.030
<v Speaker 3>then that's a military function.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

2606
01:46:20.100 --> 01:46:23.270
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then we have to commit in a way that,</v>

2607
01:46:23.330 --> 01:46:24.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not right now,</v>

2608
01:46:24.501 --> 01:46:29.270
<v Speaker 3>we've been in this sort of stalemate</v>
<v Speaker 3>situation right over there and now we're</v>

2609
01:46:29.330 --> 01:46:32.150
<v Speaker 3>somewhat surprised.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are people are surprised at the Taliban</v>

2610
01:46:32.390 --> 01:46:33.620
<v Speaker 3>is resurgent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2611
01:46:33.710 --> 01:46:36.140
<v Speaker 3>where the hell did they think they were</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to go?</v>

2612
01:46:36.710 --> 01:46:39.340
<v Speaker 3>There's Taliban don't have any place to</v>
<v Speaker 3>go there.</v>

2613
01:46:39.530 --> 01:46:43.940
<v Speaker 3>So they're gonna wait us out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was entirely predictable that some</v>

2614
01:46:43.941 --> 01:46:47.780
<v Speaker 3>and what we're trying to sell them this</v>
<v Speaker 3>pseudo federal democracy,</v>

2615
01:46:47.870 --> 01:46:49.530
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then the Afghan people don't understand</v>

2616
01:46:49.560 --> 01:46:50.670
<v Speaker 3>for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think,</v>

2617
01:46:50.671 --> 01:46:52.770
<v Speaker 3>maybe I'm just too cynical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they don't understand what the hell</v>

2618
01:46:52.771 --> 01:46:54.240
<v Speaker 3>we've been trying to sell them for all</v>
<v Speaker 3>these years.</v>

2619
01:46:54.840 --> 01:46:59.160
<v Speaker 3>So this doesn't diminish all the pain</v>
<v Speaker 3>and sacrifice and suffering of all</v>

2620
01:46:59.161 --> 01:47:02.070
<v Speaker 3>people that have been out there and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>lives that we've lost.</v>

2621
01:47:02.071 --> 01:47:04.770
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't diminish it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I'm saying is that we need to think</v>

2622
01:47:04.771 --> 01:47:06.780
<v Speaker 3>about what's our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's our end game,</v>

2623
01:47:06.960 --> 01:47:09.810
<v Speaker 3>what's our objective?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if we're worried now about the</v>

2624
01:47:09.811 --> 01:47:12.030
<v Speaker 3>Taliban resurging and Isis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2625
01:47:12.031 --> 01:47:13.770
<v Speaker 3>kind of coming back in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well fine,</v>

2626
01:47:13.800 --> 01:47:16.590
<v Speaker 3>but let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say this is our objective and to</v>

2627
01:47:16.591 --> 01:47:19.410
<v Speaker 3>meet that objective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then we're going to need more troops on</v>

2628
01:47:19.411 --> 01:47:21.330
<v Speaker 3>the ground and let's see how that plays</v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

2629
01:47:21.330 --> 01:47:23.160
<v Speaker 3>I don't think a lot of people are going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be happy about it.</v>

2630
01:47:23.370 --> 01:47:25.290
<v Speaker 3>You don't necessarily do things to make</v>
<v Speaker 3>people happy.</v>

2631
01:47:25.291 --> 01:47:28.350
<v Speaker 3>If it's a national security interests.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we decide that that's in our national</v>

2632
01:47:28.351 --> 01:47:29.760
<v Speaker 3>security interest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then yes,</v>

2633
01:47:29.761 --> 01:47:33.600
<v Speaker 3>we need to commit and do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But handing it over to a privatized,</v>

2634
01:47:34.250 --> 01:47:36.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>force to me is,</v>

2635
01:47:36.470 --> 01:47:37.750
<v Speaker 3>is uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

2636
01:47:37.770 --> 01:47:40.800
<v Speaker 3>is just slightly left of insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't make any sense.</v>

2637
01:47:41.220 --> 01:47:43.710
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's always easy for people to stand</v>

2638
01:47:43.711 --> 01:47:45.900
<v Speaker 3>around and talk tough and say we just</v>
<v Speaker 3>need more troops.</v>

2639
01:47:46.200 --> 01:47:47.033
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2640
01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:52.830
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that the objective is</v>
<v Speaker 3>sufficiently clarified to say that we</v>

2641
01:47:52.831 --> 01:47:54.570
<v Speaker 3>need more troops.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't heard.</v>

2642
01:47:54.571 --> 01:47:57.720
<v Speaker 3>I don't care whether we improve the</v>
<v Speaker 3>literacy rate of the Afghan people by</v>

2643
01:47:57.721 --> 01:48:00.240
<v Speaker 3>another percentage point of if we build</v>
<v Speaker 3>another road.</v>

2644
01:48:00.510 --> 01:48:03.690
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's in our national</v>
<v Speaker 3>security interests and so I think we</v>

2645
01:48:03.691 --> 01:48:05.850
<v Speaker 3>need to be a little bit more clear about</v>
<v Speaker 3>why we're there,</v>

2646
01:48:05.851 --> 01:48:07.290
<v Speaker 3>what we're hoping to accomplish.</v>

2647
01:48:07.290 --> 01:48:10.470
<v Speaker 3>At some point we wanted to be there so</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we wouldn't use it as a playground</v>

2648
01:48:10.740 --> 01:48:14.850
<v Speaker 3>for terrorists to then develop and plot</v>
<v Speaker 3>and plan and attack the West again,</v>

2649
01:48:15.930 --> 01:48:18.630
<v Speaker 3>so maybe the thing that will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we should have done was go in</v>

2650
01:48:18.631 --> 01:48:20.310
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kick the shit out of them that like we</v>

2651
01:48:20.311 --> 01:48:24.300
<v Speaker 3>did in Tora Bora and elsewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>explained to the remnants of the</v>

2652
01:48:24.301 --> 01:48:26.340
<v Speaker 3>government.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you allow that to happen again,</v>

2653
01:48:26.341 --> 01:48:29.220
<v Speaker 3>we're going to come back and we'll do</v>
<v Speaker 3>this again and we're very good at that.</v>

2654
01:48:29.221 --> 01:48:32.670
<v Speaker 3>We're very good at strategic operations</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we could have done that and maybe</v>

2655
01:48:32.671 --> 01:48:35.550
<v Speaker 3>that's the thing we need to do now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then that government's been corrupt</v>

2656
01:48:35.551 --> 01:48:37.710
<v Speaker 3>for a very long time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Karzai government,</v>

2657
01:48:37.711 --> 01:48:40.710
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were completely corrupt and yet we</v>

2658
01:48:40.711 --> 01:48:43.800
<v Speaker 3>all rallied around cars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I as if he was because he dressed well.</v>

2659
01:48:44.290 --> 01:48:45.870
<v Speaker 3>One of his brother was a heroin.</v>

2660
01:48:45.910 --> 01:48:46.970
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2661
01:48:47.030 --> 01:48:48.670
<v Speaker 3>It's awful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

2662
01:48:48.680 --> 01:48:50.520
<v Speaker 3>in the current government is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it any better?</v>

2663
01:48:50.521 --> 01:48:52.260
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're a little more clever at hiding</v>

2664
01:48:52.261 --> 01:48:54.210
<v Speaker 3>their corruption,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's still exists.</v>

2665
01:48:54.211 --> 01:48:56.560
<v Speaker 3>And more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the tribal society there,</v>

2666
01:48:56.700 --> 01:48:58.980
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't really get this idea of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2667
01:48:58.981 --> 01:49:00.960
<v Speaker 3>a strong central government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2668
01:49:01.350 --> 01:49:04.580
<v Speaker 3>it kind of runs counter to thousands of</v>
<v Speaker 3>years of,</v>

2669
01:49:04.620 --> 01:49:06.360
<v Speaker 3>of self governance out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>

2670
01:49:06.840 --> 01:49:07.860
<v Speaker 3>so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the thing.</v>

2671
01:49:07.861 --> 01:49:09.150
<v Speaker 3>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's he gonna say tonight?</v>

2672
01:49:09.151 --> 01:49:10.560
<v Speaker 3>I don't have a clue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think he's,</v>

2673
01:49:10.580 --> 01:49:12.030
<v Speaker 3>he does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got limited opera job.</v>

2674
01:49:12.090 --> 01:49:13.380
<v Speaker 3>What's it going to take?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to cut and run.</v>

2675
01:49:13.381 --> 01:49:15.030
<v Speaker 3>We're going to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one option.</v>

2676
01:49:15.180 --> 01:49:18.600
<v Speaker 3>We're going to increase the number of US</v>
<v Speaker 3>troops on the ground.</v>

2677
01:49:18.630 --> 01:49:21.210
<v Speaker 3>That's one option is right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a trump,</v>

2678
01:49:21.980 --> 01:49:22.780
<v Speaker 3>4,000</v>

2679
01:49:22.780 --> 01:49:24.340
<v Speaker 4>more troops to Afghanistan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that,</v>

2680
01:49:24.520 --> 01:49:27.220
<v Speaker 4>is that good?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now here's the thing about when it comes</v>

2681
01:49:27.221 --> 01:49:30.670
<v Speaker 4>to operations over there and what are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the objectives are.</v>

2682
01:49:30.910 --> 01:49:33.490
<v Speaker 4>One of the things that I've been hearing</v>
<v Speaker 4>from people that are in the military</v>

2683
01:49:33.491 --> 01:49:38.440
<v Speaker 4>that I know is they say they are happy</v>
<v Speaker 4>that trump is supporting them and that</v>

2684
01:49:38.441 --> 01:49:40.930
<v Speaker 4>trump has kind of essentially giving the</v>
<v Speaker 4>reigns,</v>

2685
01:49:40.931 --> 01:49:42.010
<v Speaker 4>the military saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

2686
01:49:42.040 --> 01:49:44.800
<v Speaker 4>this is what you guys do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to get in your way.</v>

2687
01:49:44.801 --> 01:49:47.890
<v Speaker 4>In fact I'm going to support you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there seemed to one of the few</v>

2688
01:49:47.891 --> 01:49:48.610
<v Speaker 4>groups</v>

2689
01:49:48.610 --> 01:49:52.720
<v Speaker 3>that is fairly universally happy with</v>
<v Speaker 3>his decisions in that regard and with</v>

2690
01:49:52.721 --> 01:49:54.490
<v Speaker 3>the people that he's appointed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's right.</v>

2691
01:49:54.491 --> 01:49:56.360
<v Speaker 3>I think law enforcement as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think is it?</v>

2692
01:49:56.380 --> 01:49:58.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you feel like you've got top cover,</v>

2693
01:49:58.430 --> 01:49:59.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you know,</v>

2694
01:49:59.990 --> 01:50:02.120
<v Speaker 3>that was one of the problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean people talked about the art and</v>

2695
01:50:02.140 --> 01:50:05.410
<v Speaker 3>we talked about it briefly about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>idea of the sort of the narrative of</v>

2696
01:50:06.010 --> 01:50:09.400
<v Speaker 3>sort of a battle between trump and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>intel community where the community had</v>

2697
01:50:09.401 --> 01:50:12.280
<v Speaker 3>a problem with the previous</v>
<v Speaker 3>administration because they kept</v>

2698
01:50:12.400 --> 01:50:15.220
<v Speaker 3>shifting the goal posts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were going to criminally prosecute</v>

2699
01:50:15.221 --> 01:50:19.450
<v Speaker 3>people in the agency for engaging in</v>
<v Speaker 3>that interrogation program and rendition</v>

2700
01:50:19.451 --> 01:50:24.380
<v Speaker 3>program that had been approved by the</v>
<v Speaker 3>previous administration that you know,</v>

2701
01:50:24.610 --> 01:50:27.640
<v Speaker 3>that creates some ill will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the fact that you know,</v>

2702
01:50:27.670 --> 01:50:29.320
<v Speaker 3>the military and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and to some degree,</v>

2703
01:50:29.321 --> 01:50:31.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>others and certainly law enforcement of</v>

2704
01:50:31.180 --> 01:50:34.090
<v Speaker 3>feel as if they've got this top cover</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the current administration.</v>

2705
01:50:34.090 --> 01:50:35.290
<v Speaker 3>That is a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you're,</v>

2706
01:50:35.320 --> 01:50:39.340
<v Speaker 3>if you're willing to not politicize all</v>
<v Speaker 3>of this and,</v>

2707
01:50:39.341 --> 01:50:41.680
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and make every decision related to</v>

2708
01:50:41.681 --> 01:50:45.250
<v Speaker 3>national security based on how you think</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's gonna move the polls,</v>

2709
01:50:45.700 --> 01:50:50.470
<v Speaker 3>then that's also a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As long as you're getting good solid</v>

2710
01:50:50.471 --> 01:50:54.340
<v Speaker 3>advice and you're consistent in your</v>
<v Speaker 3>decision making process,</v>

2711
01:50:54.341 --> 01:50:56.030
<v Speaker 3>all those things are good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2712
01:50:56.350 --> 01:51:00.130
<v Speaker 3>I don't know enough about trump to know</v>
<v Speaker 3>how,</v>

2713
01:51:00.280 --> 01:51:02.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he makes those decisions,</v>

2714
01:51:02.681 --> 01:51:05.920
<v Speaker 3>but he does have good of Madison's good</v>
<v Speaker 3>pump peo is a good person.</v>

2715
01:51:06.190 --> 01:51:07.020
<v Speaker 3>John Kelly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>certainly.</v>

2716
01:51:07.020 --> 01:51:07.870
<v Speaker 3>Great Guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mcmaster,</v>

2717
01:51:07.871 --> 01:51:11.590
<v Speaker 3>all these people are solid people who in</v>
<v Speaker 3>any other administration would,</v>

2718
01:51:11.670 --> 01:51:12.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people would be saying,</v>

2719
01:51:12.900 --> 01:51:13.600
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's great.</v>

2720
01:51:13.600 --> 01:51:14.860
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're very highly regarded,</v>

2721
01:51:15.190 --> 01:51:17.230
<v Speaker 3>but it's sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this cloud over because it's</v>

2722
01:51:17.231 --> 01:51:22.231
<v Speaker 3>trump and people are still not sure how</v>
<v Speaker 3>things play out in that administration,</v>

2723
01:51:22.481 --> 01:51:24.640
<v Speaker 3>but if he does listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think yeah,</v>

2724
01:51:24.641 --> 01:51:25.180
<v Speaker 3>that's a good thing.</v>

2725
01:51:25.180 --> 01:51:29.140
<v Speaker 3>But sending 4,000 more troops,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not quite 50 percent on top of</v>

2726
01:51:29.141 --> 01:51:31.490
<v Speaker 3>what we've currently got there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2727
01:51:32.290 --> 01:51:34.050
<v Speaker 3>what does that allow us to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2728
01:51:34.060 --> 01:51:38.440
<v Speaker 3>some of those troops are going to have</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be involved in security operations of</v>

2729
01:51:38.560 --> 01:51:40.060
<v Speaker 3>the trainers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of those troops are going to have</v>

2730
01:51:40.061 --> 01:51:41.320
<v Speaker 3>to be involved in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2731
01:51:41.400 --> 01:51:43.480
<v Speaker 3>logistical support,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Intel collection support.</v>

2732
01:51:43.481 --> 01:51:44.560
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2733
01:51:44.561 --> 01:51:49.561
<v Speaker 3>will it make us more effective in</v>
<v Speaker 3>defeating and the short term some of the</v>

2734
01:51:50.681 --> 01:51:54.880
<v Speaker 3>pushback from the Taliban and</v>
<v Speaker 3>identifying and taking out more isis</v>

2735
01:51:54.881 --> 01:51:55.714
<v Speaker 3>will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

2736
01:51:56.050 --> 01:51:57.880
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

2737
01:51:57.890 --> 01:51:59.580
<v Speaker 3>and then what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess that's my question.</v>

2738
01:51:59.840 --> 01:52:00.530
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

2739
01:52:00.530 --> 01:52:03.430
<v Speaker 3>what are we doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is our objective in Afghanistan</v>

2740
01:52:03.431 --> 01:52:06.070
<v Speaker 3>today in 2017?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is the objective?</v>

2741
01:52:06.880 --> 01:52:10.180
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't eloquently,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not that I could add eloquently do shit,</v>

2742
01:52:10.181 --> 01:52:13.360
<v Speaker 3>but I couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't state what our end game is</v>

2743
01:52:13.361 --> 01:52:14.380
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's,</v>

2744
01:52:14.560 --> 01:52:19.120
<v Speaker 3>I would suppose in a big picture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's to create a stable society that</v>

2745
01:52:19.420 --> 01:52:23.530
<v Speaker 3>will be a bulwark of some form of</v>
<v Speaker 3>democracy.</v>

2746
01:52:23.531 --> 01:52:24.660
<v Speaker 3>Have we ever done that thought?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2747
01:52:24.680 --> 01:52:27.370
<v Speaker 3>we ever had successfully been involved</v>
<v Speaker 3>in nation building.</v>

2748
01:52:27.580 --> 01:52:29.020
<v Speaker 3>We have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what did you think about,</v>

2749
01:52:29.021 --> 01:52:30.790
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>post World War II,</v>

2750
01:52:32.110 --> 01:52:33.770
<v Speaker 3>but that was again at different times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2751
01:52:34.030 --> 01:52:37.260
<v Speaker 3>so you can't compare it necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2752
01:52:37.330 --> 01:52:42.330
<v Speaker 3>chronologically I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so when we've invaded places or when</v>

2753
01:52:42.821 --> 01:52:45.410
<v Speaker 3>we've been a part of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look what's going on in Libya,</v>

2754
01:52:45.770 --> 01:52:46.010
<v Speaker 3>I mean</v>

2755
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:49.160
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we supported that revolution and now</v>

2756
01:52:49.161 --> 01:52:52.820
<v Speaker 2>it's a fucking complete disaster and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrifying part of the world.</v>

2757
01:52:52.821 --> 01:52:55.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a real hot mess and nobody wants to</v>

2758
01:52:55.581 --> 01:53:00.581
<v Speaker 2>talk about Libya and we didn't have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>national security interest in Libya and</v>

2759
01:53:01.010 --> 01:53:03.560
<v Speaker 2>yet we allow ourselves to get in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why did we do that?</v>

2760
01:53:04.070 --> 01:53:07.580
<v Speaker 2>A lot of pressure from the French and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Italians who did,</v>

2761
01:53:08.630 --> 01:53:12.290
<v Speaker 2>and I think we felt it was somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why,</v>

2762
01:53:12.291 --> 01:53:14.630
<v Speaker 2>but maybe there was a feeling as if it</v>
<v Speaker 2>would be easier,</v>

2763
01:53:14.690 --> 01:53:17.240
<v Speaker 2>more containable somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>

2764
01:53:17.480 --> 01:53:19.370
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's more tribal history.</v>

2765
01:53:19.371 --> 01:53:21.530
<v Speaker 2>More tribes in Libya than in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Afghanistan.</v>

2766
01:53:21.531 --> 01:53:21.931
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2767
01:53:21.931 --> 01:53:25.690
<v Speaker 2>you had to get like 130 some odd tribes</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Olympia.</v>

2768
01:53:25.790 --> 01:53:27.860
<v Speaker 2>So another thing that I watched recently</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a,</v>

2769
01:53:27.861 --> 01:53:29.570
<v Speaker 2>as a country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

2770
01:53:31.590 --> 01:53:36.590
<v Speaker 2>watch Qaddafi's death again recently and</v>
<v Speaker 2>watched the whole capture of him and the</v>

2771
01:53:37.190 --> 01:53:37.920
<v Speaker 2>whole thing.</v>

2772
01:53:37.920 --> 01:53:42.920
<v Speaker 2>It was just fascinating to watch his</v>
<v Speaker 2>brutal evil murderer is dictator.</v>

2773
01:53:43.221 --> 01:53:46.370
<v Speaker 2>All the sudden get caught by these</v>
<v Speaker 2>common people.</v>

2774
01:53:46.371 --> 01:53:48.010
<v Speaker 2>These rebels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2775
01:53:48.011 --> 01:53:48.530
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2776
01:53:48.530 --> 01:53:51.950
<v Speaker 2>outside of his palace and freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yeah,</v>

2777
01:53:52.040 --> 01:53:54.560
<v Speaker 2>players all fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the weird thing is he was,</v>

2778
01:53:54.740 --> 01:53:57.380
<v Speaker 2>he was our guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a dictator.</v>

2779
01:53:57.890 --> 01:54:01.720
<v Speaker 2>Renounced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had gotten on board for the most part</v>

2780
01:54:01.730 --> 01:54:06.730
<v Speaker 2>on sort of a counterterrorism program to</v>
<v Speaker 2>provide assistance or support or at</v>

2781
01:54:06.861 --> 01:54:09.710
<v Speaker 2>least not impede A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying it was,</v>

2782
01:54:09.720 --> 01:54:10.151
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a,</v>

2783
01:54:10.151 --> 01:54:13.910
<v Speaker 2>it was a complete son of a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's interesting isn't it?</v>

2784
01:54:13.940 --> 01:54:17.300
<v Speaker 2>The dynamics involved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we decided that it was better to</v>

2785
01:54:17.301 --> 01:54:19.580
<v Speaker 2>support the French and Italians and</v>
<v Speaker 2>topple him.</v>

2786
01:54:20.180 --> 01:54:22.460
<v Speaker 2>And now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2787
01:54:22.490 --> 01:54:23.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's always the case.</v>

2788
01:54:23.541 --> 01:54:25.040
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't always the case too that we have</v>

2789
01:54:25.041 --> 01:54:27.730
<v Speaker 2>these dictators we problem up and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>after a while,</v>

2790
01:54:27.910 --> 01:54:29.030
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this fucking guy,</v>

2791
01:54:29.031 --> 01:54:29.900
<v Speaker 2>we've got to get them out of there.</v>

2792
01:54:30.130 --> 01:54:31.170
<v Speaker 2>Like so dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2793
01:54:31.550 --> 01:54:35.840
<v Speaker 2>Sort of same and Hussein lasted a long</v>
<v Speaker 2>time in that position.</v>

2794
01:54:35.841 --> 01:54:39.230
<v Speaker 2>When you think about the horrific nature</v>
<v Speaker 2>of some of the shit that he did and his</v>

2795
01:54:39.231 --> 01:54:40.450
<v Speaker 2>sons did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2796
01:54:40.540 --> 01:54:43.090
<v Speaker 2>Sons were completely monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2797
01:54:43.460 --> 01:54:44.271
<v Speaker 2>And that's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2798
01:54:44.271 --> 01:54:44.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2799
01:54:44.870 --> 01:54:45.830
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2800
01:54:45.831 --> 01:54:50.831
<v Speaker 2>how did it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how did his presence when they were at</v>

2801
01:54:50.931 --> 01:54:52.230
<v Speaker 2>odds with Iran,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2802
01:54:52.310 --> 01:54:57.310
<v Speaker 2>how did that help our overall sense of</v>
<v Speaker 2>strategic foreign policy?</v>

2803
01:54:59.540 --> 01:55:01.670
<v Speaker 2>So things happen and you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2804
01:55:01.671 --> 01:55:03.140
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't get to pick and choose</v>

2805
01:55:03.141 --> 01:55:05.180
<v Speaker 2>sometimes I guess maybe you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then it'd be,</v>

2806
01:55:05.900 --> 01:55:09.050
<v Speaker 2>it'd be a kind of a strange world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you got to deal with sometimes with</v>

2807
01:55:09.051 --> 01:55:11.830
<v Speaker 2>the people that are out there and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

2808
01:55:12.010 --> 01:55:14.630
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's,</v>

2809
01:55:15.080 --> 01:55:15.890
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

2810
01:55:15.890 --> 01:55:17.850
<v Speaker 2>4,000 more troops in Afghanistan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2811
01:55:18.320 --> 01:55:21.080
<v Speaker 2>is that going to somehow solve a</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem?</v>

2812
01:55:21.081 --> 01:55:22.820
<v Speaker 2>It's going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suspect,</v>

2813
01:55:22.821 --> 01:55:24.490
<v Speaker 2>kick the can down the road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again.</v>

2814
01:55:24.800 --> 01:55:26.090
<v Speaker 2>It's like Vietnam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would you do?</v>

2815
01:55:26.120 --> 01:55:28.340
<v Speaker 2>Where did the vehicle have to go?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had nowhere to go.</v>

2816
01:55:29.140 --> 01:55:30.740
<v Speaker 2>It's a totally different situation</v>
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>

2817
01:55:30.741 --> 01:55:32.210
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the Viet Cong really didn't have</v>

2818
01:55:32.211 --> 01:55:33.710
<v Speaker 2>any threat to us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2819
01:55:33.711 --> 01:55:36.170
<v Speaker 2>what I mean is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is what did we think was gonna Happen?</v>

2820
01:55:36.470 --> 01:55:38.660
<v Speaker 2>They were going to outweighed us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were going to have glasses.</v>

2821
01:55:38.661 --> 01:55:42.200
<v Speaker 2>They were going to say the suffering was</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing in their minds compared to what</v>

2822
01:55:42.201 --> 01:55:44.460
<v Speaker 2>we were going through and how we were</v>
<v Speaker 2>processing.</v>

2823
01:55:44.460 --> 01:55:45.910
<v Speaker 3>And so I guess that's what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't.</v>

2824
01:55:45.930 --> 01:55:46.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything is,</v>

2825
01:55:46.620 --> 01:55:47.221
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

2826
01:55:47.221 --> 01:55:48.480
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is relative,</v>

2827
01:55:48.481 --> 01:55:49.880
<v Speaker 3>but I mean with this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2828
01:55:50.140 --> 01:55:51.580
<v Speaker 3>what would you do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2829
01:55:51.590 --> 01:55:53.460
<v Speaker 3>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were in the situation to call the</v>

2830
01:55:53.461 --> 01:55:54.360
<v Speaker 3>shots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If someone said,</v>

2831
01:55:54.361 --> 01:55:55.860
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mike Baker,</v>

2832
01:55:56.250 --> 01:55:58.170
<v Speaker 3>what do we do about Afghanistan?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2833
01:55:58.340 --> 01:55:59.250
<v Speaker 3>And you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

2834
01:56:00.310 --> 01:56:00.931
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2835
01:56:00.931 --> 01:56:01.690
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2836
01:56:01.690 --> 01:56:04.020
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying it's an easy by any</v>

2837
01:56:04.021 --> 01:56:05.280
<v Speaker 3>means.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

2838
01:56:05.310 --> 01:56:06.630
<v Speaker 3>it's above my pay grade,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but b,</v>

2839
01:56:07.320 --> 01:56:11.610
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isis creates a different situation</v>

2840
01:56:11.640 --> 01:56:15.960
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we hadn't seen isis develop and start</v>

2841
01:56:15.961 --> 01:56:19.680
<v Speaker 3>to impact to some degree things that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>going on in Afghanistan,</v>

2842
01:56:20.100 --> 01:56:23.220
<v Speaker 3>then I think we could be better off just</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>

2843
01:56:23.250 --> 01:56:23.850
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're gonna.</v>

2844
01:56:23.850 --> 01:56:26.670
<v Speaker 3>Figure out a way to work with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Taliban.</v>

2845
01:56:26.710 --> 01:56:30.090
<v Speaker 3>I mean the Taliban,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think at this stage of the game could</v>

2846
01:56:30.091 --> 01:56:34.440
<v Speaker 3>be contained within Afghanistan without</v>
<v Speaker 3>allowing their place to be used as a</v>

2847
01:56:34.441 --> 01:56:35.850
<v Speaker 3>shelter for terrorism.</v>

2848
01:56:36.380 --> 01:56:40.260
<v Speaker 3>I say that now caveating saying now</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got isis and that's a different</v>

2849
01:56:40.261 --> 01:56:42.870
<v Speaker 3>kettle of fish because they're at odds</v>
<v Speaker 3>with each other.</v>

2850
01:56:43.410 --> 01:56:44.460
<v Speaker 3>So what are we going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I ended up,</v>

2851
01:56:44.500 --> 01:56:46.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in some weird fashion supporting the</v>

2852
01:56:46.501 --> 01:56:48.270
<v Speaker 3>Taliban and their efforts to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2853
01:56:48.420 --> 01:56:50.940
<v Speaker 3>stamp out isis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2854
01:56:50.970 --> 01:56:51.803
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

2855
01:56:52.240 --> 01:56:53.550
<v Speaker 3>it's real weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2856
01:56:54.510 --> 01:56:58.260
<v Speaker 3>This is what we're talking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thousands of years of history of failed</v>

2857
01:56:58.261 --> 01:57:01.020
<v Speaker 3>efforts in Afghanistan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And do I think,</v>

2858
01:57:01.021 --> 01:57:03.450
<v Speaker 3>do I have the Hubris to think that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>somehow are going to solve this?</v>

2859
01:57:03.451 --> 01:57:04.830
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2860
01:57:05.760 --> 01:57:09.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe maybe the answer is just find that</v>

2861
01:57:09.001 --> 01:57:13.620
<v Speaker 3>point on the curve where you can support</v>
<v Speaker 3>an existing government that you can hold</v>

2862
01:57:13.621 --> 01:57:15.250
<v Speaker 3>your nose and live with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

2863
01:57:15.270 --> 01:57:18.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's corrupt and you know,</v>

2864
01:57:18.030 --> 01:57:22.020
<v Speaker 3>but at least they're working in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>counter terrorism realm,</v>

2865
01:57:22.230 --> 01:57:24.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're there supporting those sort</v>

2866
01:57:24.601 --> 01:57:26.040
<v Speaker 3>of interests from our perspective.</v>

2867
01:57:26.670 --> 01:57:28.320
<v Speaker 3>And yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2868
01:57:28.321 --> 01:57:31.530
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we're ever going to get to</v>
<v Speaker 3>that point where we see a stable self</v>

2869
01:57:31.550 --> 01:57:32.830
<v Speaker 3>supporting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2870
01:57:33.060 --> 01:57:36.630
<v Speaker 3>pseudo democratic nation exist there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't think it's going to happen.</v>

2871
01:57:37.020 --> 01:57:42.020
<v Speaker 3>So that's a hugely unsatisfying answer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

2872
01:57:42.181 --> 01:57:43.890
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's like pollution.</v>

2873
01:57:43.891 --> 01:57:46.200
<v Speaker 3>You do little things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know and hope that it helps.</v>

2874
01:57:46.680 --> 01:57:48.570
<v Speaker 3>And maybe that's what we're doing here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2875
01:57:48.571 --> 01:57:50.700
<v Speaker 3>if you just start from the point of view</v>
<v Speaker 3>of saying we're going to create a</v>

2876
01:57:50.701 --> 01:57:52.830
<v Speaker 3>bulwark of democracy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you overwhelmed,</v>

2877
01:57:52.831 --> 01:57:54.510
<v Speaker 3>it's never going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you don't do anything.</v>

2878
01:57:54.610 --> 01:57:55.940
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>background.</v>

2879
01:57:56.260 --> 01:57:57.450
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of me just,</v>

2880
01:57:57.451 --> 01:57:59.610
<v Speaker 3>I hate the idea of leaving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2881
01:57:59.660 --> 01:58:02.410
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of people do who are</v>

2882
01:58:02.420 --> 01:58:03.690
<v Speaker 3>living,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to create a vacuum,</v>

2883
01:58:03.691 --> 01:58:04.360
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2884
01:58:04.360 --> 01:58:05.400
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and quite frankly,</v>

2885
01:58:05.401 --> 01:58:07.050
<v Speaker 3>that's typically what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2886
01:58:07.060 --> 01:58:10.440
<v Speaker 3>and particularly with isis president</v>
<v Speaker 3>said they would see that and they would</v>

2887
01:58:10.441 --> 01:58:11.400
<v Speaker 3>see an opportunity.</v>

2888
01:58:11.850 --> 01:58:12.601
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2889
01:58:12.601 --> 01:58:13.140
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

2890
01:58:13.140 --> 01:58:15.750
<v Speaker 3>they're at odds with the Taliban and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Taliban is pretty brutal.</v>

2891
01:58:16.050 --> 01:58:17.880
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could they handle it on their own,</v>

2892
01:58:17.900 --> 01:58:18.511
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning,</v>

2893
01:58:18.511 --> 01:58:21.540
<v Speaker 3>could they destroy isis on their own?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who knows?</v>

2894
01:58:21.570 --> 01:58:23.070
<v Speaker 3>Maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a,</v>

2895
01:58:23.071 --> 01:58:25.320
<v Speaker 3>it certainly complicates the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But now,</v>

2896
01:58:25.400 --> 01:58:30.240
<v Speaker 3>especially if we just decide to switch</v>
<v Speaker 3>somehow or another support isis now,</v>

2897
01:58:30.270 --> 01:58:31.800
<v Speaker 3>that's never going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whenever.</v>

2898
01:58:31.830 --> 01:58:32.663
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2899
01:58:32.670 --> 01:58:34.170
<v Speaker 3>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Taliban,</v>

2900
01:58:34.790 --> 01:58:36.900
<v Speaker 3>their battle against Isis could see</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2901
01:58:37.680 --> 01:58:40.560
<v Speaker 3>I could see elements of the Taliban</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>

2902
01:58:40.561 --> 01:58:42.640
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we just want to self govern.</v>

2903
01:58:42.940 --> 01:58:43.870
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

2904
01:58:43.871 --> 01:58:44.830
<v Speaker 3>we get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you're not going to</v>

2905
01:58:45.030 --> 01:58:48.830
<v Speaker 4>imagine a scenario where the United</v>
<v Speaker 4>States would support the Taliban because</v>

2906
01:58:48.831 --> 01:58:52.400
<v Speaker 4>they were at war with Isis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Taliban could soften their stance on</v>

2907
01:58:52.401 --> 01:58:54.440
<v Speaker 4>some things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We reached some sort of common ground.</v>

2908
01:58:54.610 --> 01:58:58.300
<v Speaker 3>Well look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're kind of on the same side with Iran</v>

2909
01:58:58.301 --> 01:59:01.750
<v Speaker 3>against Isis right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we're not supporting Iran in a way.</v>

2910
01:59:01.751 --> 01:59:05.380
<v Speaker 3>We are in a sense that we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're trying to kill the same people.</v>

2911
01:59:05.500 --> 01:59:07.780
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So who would have thought that,</v>

2912
01:59:07.840 --> 01:59:09.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>four or five years ago.</v>

2913
01:59:09.370 --> 01:59:11.770
<v Speaker 3>So that's how nutty Isis says.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2914
01:59:11.860 --> 01:59:12.551
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2915
01:59:12.551 --> 01:59:14.210
<v Speaker 3>Everybody can agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody get a great.</v>

2916
01:59:14.730 --> 01:59:16.840
<v Speaker 3>That's the one group that everybody can</v>
<v Speaker 3>agree on.</v>

2917
01:59:17.230 --> 01:59:19.270
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

2918
01:59:19.360 --> 01:59:20.380
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting.</v>

2919
01:59:20.381 --> 01:59:22.780
<v Speaker 3>So that's what the president's going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>talk about this evening.</v>

2920
01:59:22.781 --> 01:59:25.270
<v Speaker 3>4,000 more troops.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2921
01:59:25.271 --> 01:59:29.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he could have said we're gonna leave and</v>

2922
01:59:29.350 --> 01:59:32.320
<v Speaker 3>the people that hate trump would be up</v>
<v Speaker 3>in arms.</v>

2923
01:59:32.321 --> 01:59:34.570
<v Speaker 3>You could say we're going to add 40,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>troops are going to be up in arms.</v>

2924
01:59:34.571 --> 01:59:36.580
<v Speaker 3>You could say we're going to give it</v>
<v Speaker 3>over to the private contractors.</v>

2925
01:59:36.581 --> 01:59:37.960
<v Speaker 3>They'd be up in arms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't really matter.</v>

2926
01:59:38.200 --> 01:59:40.240
<v Speaker 3>So there's going to be a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>opposition to this regardless.</v>

2927
01:59:40.810 --> 01:59:43.450
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there's a clear defined mission with</v>

2928
01:59:43.451 --> 01:59:45.250
<v Speaker 3>an end game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fine.</v>

2929
01:59:45.700 --> 01:59:47.470
<v Speaker 3>I just haven't heard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what that is.</v>

2930
01:59:47.740 --> 01:59:49.600
<v Speaker 3>And maybe they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe they've said it and I just haven't</v>

2931
01:59:49.601 --> 01:59:50.150
<v Speaker 3>seen it.</v>

2932
01:59:50.150 --> 01:59:52.640
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it seems like the only way we're ever</v>

2933
01:59:52.641 --> 01:59:56.210
<v Speaker 4>going to get peace and harmony in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>world is if there's no fifth world,</v>

2934
01:59:56.211 --> 01:59:58.430
<v Speaker 4>fourth world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>third world or second world.</v>

2935
01:59:58.460 --> 02:00:02.690
<v Speaker 4>Just one first world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody has like suburban problems.</v>

2936
02:00:02.770 --> 02:00:03.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2937
02:00:04.120 --> 02:00:05.490
<v Speaker 3>Is that even possible?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2938
02:00:05.560 --> 02:00:08.290
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never society where everybody's on the</v>

2939
02:00:08.291 --> 02:00:09.760
<v Speaker 3>same footing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Impossible.</v>

2940
02:00:10.230 --> 02:00:15.230
<v Speaker 3>A universal basic income and a cross the</v>
<v Speaker 3>world and get rid of law enforcement.</v>

2941
02:00:17.100 --> 02:00:19.600
<v Speaker 3>Doing exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No everywhere.</v>

2942
02:00:19.630 --> 02:00:20.680
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2943
02:00:20.710 --> 02:00:22.350
<v Speaker 3>it's not gonna happen and I,</v>

2944
02:00:22.660 --> 02:00:27.110
<v Speaker 4>that's so disheartening for people</v>
<v Speaker 4>though to a guy like you as so many</v>

2945
02:00:27.130 --> 02:00:32.130
<v Speaker 4>years of experience in intelligence</v>
<v Speaker 4>agencies that you would say that there's</v>

2946
02:00:33.431 --> 02:00:36.910
<v Speaker 4>nothing that could ever be done that</v>
<v Speaker 4>would give peace in the world.</v>

2947
02:00:36.911 --> 02:00:40.180
<v Speaker 4>Like generations from now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're still going to be dealing with the</v>

2948
02:00:40.181 --> 02:00:41.014
<v Speaker 4>same issues.</v>

2949
02:00:41.100 --> 02:00:45.560
<v Speaker 3>Maybe if the chemist can figure out a</v>
<v Speaker 3>way to get us all so next to see mean</v>

2950
02:00:45.561 --> 02:00:47.410
<v Speaker 3>that's going to solve it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2951
02:00:47.440 --> 02:00:47.881
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2952
02:00:47.881 --> 02:00:48.250
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2953
02:00:48.250 --> 02:00:49.300
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the way it is.</v>

2954
02:00:49.301 --> 02:00:50.950
<v Speaker 3>It's human nature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

2955
02:00:52.020 --> 02:00:52.853
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2956
02:00:53.330 --> 02:00:54.930
<v Speaker 3>we have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we go through periods of pace,</v>

2957
02:00:54.960 --> 02:00:57.700
<v Speaker 3>you can go through periods of prosperity</v>
<v Speaker 3>and during those periods it kind of</v>

2958
02:00:57.701 --> 02:01:01.030
<v Speaker 3>helps to lift everybody up and they get</v>
<v Speaker 3>to a certain level that they didn't</v>

2959
02:01:01.031 --> 02:01:03.670
<v Speaker 3>imagine before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's still trailing.</v>

2960
02:01:03.700 --> 02:01:05.950
<v Speaker 3>But are we ever going to get to a point</v>
<v Speaker 3>where we're all,</v>

2961
02:01:06.530 --> 02:01:08.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're all the same.</v>

2962
02:01:08.501 --> 02:01:09.334
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2963
02:01:09.820 --> 02:01:11.620
<v Speaker 3>I mean I hate great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't see it.</v>

2964
02:01:12.520 --> 02:01:13.750
<v Speaker 3>Here's the perfect xenical</v>

2965
02:01:13.980 --> 02:01:15.510
<v Speaker 4>the United States in Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2966
02:01:15.511 --> 02:01:18.660
<v Speaker 4>We were at war in the 19 forties and now</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're absolutely a piece.</v>

2967
02:01:19.180 --> 02:01:23.720
<v Speaker 4>I mean this in Germany is prosperous and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a great country and everything's</v>

2968
02:01:23.730 --> 02:01:24.720
<v Speaker 4>great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2969
02:01:25.200 --> 02:01:30.060
<v Speaker 4>I would wonder what would have to take</v>
<v Speaker 4>place for this to be a worldwide thing</v>

2970
02:01:30.120 --> 02:01:34.740
<v Speaker 4>where the rest of the world sort of</v>
<v Speaker 4>rises up to an adequate level of</v>

2971
02:01:34.741 --> 02:01:39.741
<v Speaker 4>civilization and we no longer engage and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the potential global war</v>

2972
02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:42.650
<v Speaker 2>that we're all looking at right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we're really looking at the</v>

2973
02:01:42.651 --> 02:01:47.240
<v Speaker 2>possibility with Russia and with North</v>
<v Speaker 2>Korea and all these different players.</v>

2974
02:01:47.600 --> 02:01:50.380
<v Speaker 2>There could be some sort of a twisted</v>
<v Speaker 2>world war three going on.</v>

2975
02:01:50.620 --> 02:01:53.780
<v Speaker 2>Russia is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russia is punching over its weight.</v>

2976
02:01:54.280 --> 02:01:56.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russia's got to GDP,</v>

2977
02:01:56.900 --> 02:02:00.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>equivalent to a midsize EU country.</v>

2978
02:02:00.320 --> 02:02:00.801
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2979
02:02:00.801 --> 02:02:01.960
<v Speaker 2>so they just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2980
02:02:02.020 --> 02:02:04.610
<v Speaker 2>at Putin is very clear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wants to rebuild the Soviet Union to</v>

2981
02:02:04.611 --> 02:02:06.200
<v Speaker 2>some degree in some fashion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2982
02:02:06.201 --> 02:02:07.980
<v Speaker 2>And he's been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's done it through some territory.</v>

2983
02:02:07.981 --> 02:02:11.450
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't do energy policy through</v>
<v Speaker 2>meddling like they always do,</v>

2984
02:02:11.810 --> 02:02:12.643
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2985
02:02:12.690 --> 02:02:13.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think Russia,</v>

2986
02:02:13.551 --> 02:02:15.650
<v Speaker 2>but to your point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2987
02:02:15.651 --> 02:02:17.590
<v Speaker 2>as with the US Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could we see a,</v>

2988
02:02:17.870 --> 02:02:22.870
<v Speaker 2>a way that the US and Iran for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could find common ground and suddenly 40</v>

2989
02:02:22.971 --> 02:02:26.240
<v Speaker 2>years from now be at peace and not only</v>
<v Speaker 2>a piece but supporting each other's</v>

2990
02:02:26.241 --> 02:02:29.420
<v Speaker 2>economy and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have that sort of interaction.</v>

2991
02:02:29.450 --> 02:02:32.150
<v Speaker 2>And</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>

2992
02:02:32.300 --> 02:02:34.030
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanks.</v>

2993
02:02:34.090 --> 02:02:37.140
<v Speaker 2>So damn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can I pour some coffee and I'm good.</v>

2994
02:02:37.310 --> 02:02:38.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm just thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just like,</v>

2995
02:02:38.920 --> 02:02:41.000
<v Speaker 2>just at a certain point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>

2996
02:02:42.050 --> 02:02:46.430
<v Speaker 2>it's very frustrating to think that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess the pace of progress is so</v>

2997
02:02:46.431 --> 02:02:48.350
<v Speaker 2>incredibly slow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you look back in history,</v>

2998
02:02:48.351 --> 02:02:51.110
<v Speaker 2>this is probably the safest time to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>alive ever.</v>

2999
02:02:51.111 --> 02:02:55.250
<v Speaker 2>So there's been some progress from Roman</v>
<v Speaker 2>times to today.</v>

3000
02:02:55.340 --> 02:02:57.530
<v Speaker 2>There's obviously been some worldwide</v>
<v Speaker 2>progress.</v>

3001
02:02:57.560 --> 02:02:58.011
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

3002
02:02:58.011 --> 02:02:58.701
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3003
02:02:58.701 --> 02:03:01.980
<v Speaker 2>Longevity and stamping out disease and</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the rest of those things.</v>

3004
02:03:02.080 --> 02:03:04.010
<v Speaker 2>Where is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3005
02:03:04.070 --> 02:03:06.770
<v Speaker 2>for what it's worth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a great time to be alive and people</v>

3006
02:03:06.771 --> 02:03:10.280
<v Speaker 2>that are walking around everyday trying</v>
<v Speaker 2>to find a reason to be offended or</v>

3007
02:03:10.340 --> 02:03:14.570
<v Speaker 2>finding that it is because there's no</v>
<v Speaker 2>real conflict that they have these</v>

3008
02:03:14.571 --> 02:03:18.760
<v Speaker 2>issues that the words aren't coming over</v>
<v Speaker 2>the border to know,</v>

3009
02:03:18.880 --> 02:03:19.360
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3010
02:03:19.360 --> 02:03:20.610
<v Speaker 2>to rape and pillage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3011
02:03:20.690 --> 02:03:21.710
<v Speaker 2>Great Depression.</v>

3012
02:03:22.040 --> 02:03:26.090
<v Speaker 2>There's food will display easy to find.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did find the plague that did found</v>

3013
02:03:26.091 --> 02:03:27.740
<v Speaker 2>the P bionic plague on some ticks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3014
02:03:27.800 --> 02:03:29.060
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where was that?</v>

3015
02:03:29.210 --> 02:03:33.050
<v Speaker 2>Was that in Arizona?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I figured it was God Damn Arizona.</v>

3016
02:03:34.290 --> 02:03:36.260
<v Speaker 2>It's a response to Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our pio,</v>

3017
02:03:36.261 --> 02:03:38.060
<v Speaker 2>getting arrested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's mad.</v>

3018
02:03:38.120 --> 02:03:42.080
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if that's what it wasn't there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some talk about trump pardoning him.</v>

3019
02:03:42.170 --> 02:03:43.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does he get?</v>

3020
02:03:43.850 --> 02:03:47.630
<v Speaker 2>His bubonic plague and Arizona Fleas</v>
<v Speaker 2>found carrying the infectious disease.</v>

3021
02:03:47.650 --> 02:03:50.260
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wonderful Guy.</v>

3022
02:03:50.400 --> 02:03:51.770
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's where it's going to be.</v>

3023
02:03:51.771 --> 02:03:52.970
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is my,</v>

3024
02:03:53.450 --> 02:03:55.670
<v Speaker 2>for what it's worth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put this along with my big pussy</v>

3025
02:03:55.671 --> 02:03:58.250
<v Speaker 2>theory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not going to be the North</v>

3026
02:03:58.250 --> 02:03:58.461
<v Speaker 2>Koreans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3027
02:03:58.461 --> 02:04:01.390
<v Speaker 2>firing off a missile or whatever it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>gonna be this idea.</v>

3028
02:04:01.391 --> 02:04:03.560
<v Speaker 2>It's gonna be a pandemic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something that we didn't quite see</v>

3029
02:04:03.561 --> 02:04:07.490
<v Speaker 2>coming mutation of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a disease or something that because I</v>

3030
02:04:07.491 --> 02:04:10.940
<v Speaker 2>do believe in the idea that nature takes</v>
<v Speaker 2>care of its own eventually,</v>

3031
02:04:10.970 --> 02:04:12.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like a deer herd or whatever.</v>

3032
02:04:12.990 --> 02:04:17.990
<v Speaker 2>And eventually the overpopulation issue</v>
<v Speaker 2>becomes a concern and that's how the</v>

3033
02:04:18.801 --> 02:04:21.370
<v Speaker 2>earth tends to reset itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3034
02:04:21.380 --> 02:04:23.060
<v Speaker 2>that is always how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3035
02:04:23.780 --> 02:04:26.300
<v Speaker 2>That would suck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But another reason to be in Idaho,</v>

3036
02:04:26.810 --> 02:04:31.550
<v Speaker 2>bubonic plague and they have three human</v>
<v Speaker 2>cases in New Mexico that article said,</v>

3037
02:04:31.880 --> 02:04:34.130
<v Speaker 2>and then they found it in fleas in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Arizona.</v>

3038
02:04:36.030 --> 02:04:38.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well everybody goes to your doctor.</v>

3039
02:04:38.520 --> 02:04:41.820
<v Speaker 2>Well survive the winter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Idaho,</v>

3040
02:04:42.030 --> 02:04:43.430
<v Speaker 2>what else has been going on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What else?</v>

3041
02:04:43.440 --> 02:04:46.740
<v Speaker 2>You tell me</v>
<v Speaker 2>the inside track.</v>

3042
02:04:46.741 --> 02:04:48.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well there is that a man with a suit</v>

3043
02:04:48.151 --> 02:04:50.270
<v Speaker 2>coat on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I get that and what?</v>

3044
02:04:50.560 --> 02:04:52.260
<v Speaker 2>What I have in here also as a pocket</v>
<v Speaker 2>square,</v>

3045
02:04:53.340 --> 02:04:55.050
<v Speaker 2>I can pull it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I pulled that out when I do a TV</v>

3046
02:04:55.051 --> 02:04:57.210
<v Speaker 2>interview,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I pulled up a pocket square and just to</v>

3047
02:04:57.211 --> 02:04:59.970
<v Speaker 2>get a little classier way how people</v>
<v Speaker 2>tend to think you know what you're</v>

3048
02:04:59.971 --> 02:05:01.560
<v Speaker 2>talking about when you have a Hanky.</v>

3049
02:05:01.680 --> 02:05:05.090
<v Speaker 2>I've learned that from a Guy Ritchie</v>
<v Speaker 2>explained the pocket square to me.</v>

3050
02:05:05.430 --> 02:05:06.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he schooled me in it,</v>

3051
02:05:07.400 --> 02:05:09.720
<v Speaker 2>so it's not something that I was working</v>
<v Speaker 2>on and developing.</v>

3052
02:05:09.721 --> 02:05:11.790
<v Speaker 2>This is his theory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his theory,</v>

3053
02:05:11.791 --> 02:05:16.791
<v Speaker 2>but he is a very well educated and very</v>
<v Speaker 2>well thought out in regards to his</v>

3054
02:05:19.471 --> 02:05:22.570
<v Speaker 2>choice of suits and a man wearing a well</v>
<v Speaker 2>tailored suit.</v>

3055
02:05:22.571 --> 02:05:24.390
<v Speaker 2>Tim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is he still married to Madonna?</v>

3056
02:05:24.760 --> 02:05:27.550
<v Speaker 2>We got rid of the check a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember,</v>

3057
02:05:27.551 --> 02:05:29.520
<v Speaker 2>but he had a kid with her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3058
02:05:30.060 --> 02:05:31.080
<v Speaker 2>there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3059
02:05:31.410 --> 02:05:33.870
<v Speaker 2>I remember Madonna as soon as she</v>
<v Speaker 2>started seeing Guy Richie.</v>

3060
02:05:33.871 --> 02:05:38.871
<v Speaker 2>I was living in England at the time and</v>
<v Speaker 2>she just suddenly out of nowhere had a</v>

3061
02:05:39.870 --> 02:05:40.980
<v Speaker 2>British accent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love it,</v>

3062
02:05:41.010 --> 02:05:41.750
<v Speaker 2>love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People do.</v>

3063
02:05:41.750 --> 02:05:43.740
<v Speaker 2>That's fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that.</v>

3064
02:05:43.800 --> 02:05:46.590
<v Speaker 2>I love when white people talk like black</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

3065
02:05:46.650 --> 02:05:47.570
<v Speaker 2>I love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3066
02:05:47.920 --> 02:05:51.600
<v Speaker 2>it's my favorite or a Chinese guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking like black guy that's even</v>

3067
02:05:51.601 --> 02:05:52.434
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>

3068
02:05:52.680 --> 02:05:54.590
<v Speaker 2>Chinese guy now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I what?</v>

3069
02:05:54.600 --> 02:05:55.800
<v Speaker 2>Have you heard that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it.</v>

3070
02:05:55.860 --> 02:06:00.860
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it many times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big fan of a trans racial,</v>

3071
02:06:01.860 --> 02:06:04.500
<v Speaker 2>like people that think they're the wrong</v>
<v Speaker 2>race.</v>

3072
02:06:04.530 --> 02:06:05.730
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a new thing.</v>

3073
02:06:05.760 --> 02:06:09.390
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the few trans things you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>mock still.</v>

3074
02:06:09.420 --> 02:06:10.770
<v Speaker 2>Can you mock it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3075
02:06:10.810 --> 02:06:13.230
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Letting it go.</v>

3076
02:06:13.710 --> 02:06:14.960
<v Speaker 2>He said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that'd be,</v>

3077
02:06:14.980 --> 02:06:19.890
<v Speaker 2>that would be Rachel Dolezal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Naacp in spokane.</v>

3078
02:06:20.010 --> 02:06:23.010

3080
02:06:24.900 --> 02:06:26.800
<v Speaker 2>but he denies it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says that,</v>

3081
02:06:26.801 --> 02:06:27.720
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's actually,</v>

<v Speaker 2>they all lied to them.</v>

3085
02:06:35.540 --> 02:06:37.620
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're line everybody else and only he</v>

3086
02:06:37.621 --> 02:06:40.140
<v Speaker 2>knows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh well it says his mom had an affair</v>

3087
02:06:40.141 --> 02:06:42.110
<v Speaker 2>with a light skin black man or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

3088
02:06:42.160 --> 02:06:43.830
<v Speaker 2>Somebody who knows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

3089
02:06:43.890 --> 02:06:45.360
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just I can't,</v>

3090
02:06:47.250 --> 02:06:50.940
<v Speaker 2>I can't find enough energy given</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything else that's going to be</v>

3091
02:06:50.941 --> 02:06:53.220
<v Speaker 2>offended by very much frankly.</v>

3092
02:06:53.220 --> 02:06:55.590
<v Speaker 2>I just don't get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like people to live their own lives.</v>

3093
02:06:55.591 --> 02:06:57.930
<v Speaker 2>If you are happy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God bless you.</v>

3094
02:06:57.940 --> 02:07:01.230
<v Speaker 2>Just be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm way more amused that I am ever</v>

3095

<v Speaker 2>blackest name the world has ever known</v>

<v Speaker 2>transformational to do the game.</v>

3113
02:07:54.370 --> 02:07:56.110
<v Speaker 2>I liked the description that they give</v>
<v Speaker 2>her.</v>

3114
02:07:56.350 --> 02:07:59.210
<v Speaker 2>She's a former civil rights activist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Enough.</v>

3115
02:07:59.310 --> 02:07:59.741
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3116
02:07:59.741 --> 02:08:03.160
<v Speaker 2>I guess because she was fired,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but former Afrikanas studies instructor.</v>

3117
02:08:03.161 --> 02:08:05.980
<v Speaker 2>What's Afrikaana?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She decided to give up the civil rights</v>

3118
02:08:05.981 --> 02:08:08.050
<v Speaker 2>activist thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hm.</v>

3119
02:08:08.190 --> 02:08:09.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Silly goose.</v>

3120
02:08:09.730 --> 02:08:11.620
<v Speaker 2>But it was great when she had like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>fro,</v>

3121
02:08:11.650 --> 02:08:14.340
<v Speaker 2>like look at her over there with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3122
02:08:14.610 --> 02:08:18.400
<v Speaker 2>Full white family orange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Spray Tan from Lincoln County,</v>

3123
02:08:18.401 --> 02:08:20.500
<v Speaker 2>Montana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Little Ruth Ann's girl.</v>

3124
02:08:21.310 --> 02:08:24.790
<v Speaker 2>But she feels like she identifies with</v>
<v Speaker 2>black people more.</v>

3125
02:08:24.791 --> 02:08:28.990
<v Speaker 2>She likes the culture more and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's always been people that like the</v>

3126
02:08:28.991 --> 02:08:32.560
<v Speaker 2>culture more and talk less.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure that they're a part of the culture.</v>

3127
02:08:32.561 --> 02:08:34.510
<v Speaker 2>You don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't say you are.</v>

3128
02:08:34.560 --> 02:08:36.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the new thing though,</v>

3129
02:08:36.160 --> 02:08:37.510
<v Speaker 2>isn't that a love of creating and</v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't.</v>

3130
02:08:37.510 --> 02:08:39.970
<v Speaker 2>They aren't the people that are offended</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the idea of appropriating.</v>

3131
02:08:39.971 --> 02:08:43.590
<v Speaker 2>Like if I opened a Mexican restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people would be offended because I</v>

3132
02:08:43.600 --> 02:08:44.770
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should just,</v>

3133
02:08:45.280 --> 02:08:46.020
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3134
02:08:46.020 --> 02:08:49.600
<v Speaker 2>and I know you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know black people that were furious at</v>

3135
02:08:49.601 --> 02:08:52.900
<v Speaker 2>her and I know other people that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>also black that were laughing</v>

3136
02:08:52.901 --> 02:08:55.420
<v Speaker 2>hysterically at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They thought it was what it was.</v>

3137
02:08:55.450 --> 02:08:58.780
<v Speaker 2>I think it really doesn't affect you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's preposterous and not only that,</v>

3138
02:08:58.990 --> 02:09:01.540
<v Speaker 2>don't be infuriated by the fact that she</v>
<v Speaker 2>got caught.</v>

3139
02:09:01.750 --> 02:09:05.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean she's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is not like having any undue</v>

3140
02:09:05.831 --> 02:09:07.630
<v Speaker 2>influence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is all ridiculous.</v>

3141
02:09:07.690 --> 02:09:08.231
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

3142
02:09:08.231 --> 02:09:10.480
<v Speaker 2>And that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also again,</v>

3143
02:09:10.481 --> 02:09:13.240
<v Speaker 2>it's this idea that people are walking</v>
<v Speaker 2>around looking for reasons to be</v>

3144
02:09:13.241 --> 02:09:13.800
<v Speaker 2>offended.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3145
02:09:13.800 --> 02:09:16.720
<v Speaker 2>And it just seems exhausting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like everything.</v>

3146
02:09:16.790 --> 02:09:18.850
<v Speaker 2>And so I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how people do it.</v>

3147
02:09:18.850 --> 02:09:22.270
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why they do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they just don't have enough going</v>

3148
02:09:22.271 --> 02:09:24.880
<v Speaker 2>on in their lives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have enough objectivity and they get</v>

3149
02:09:24.881 --> 02:09:28.150
<v Speaker 2>caught up in the momentum of being</v>
<v Speaker 2>pissed off about something,</v>

3150
02:09:28.660 --> 02:09:32.110
<v Speaker 2>but the cultural appropriation or</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretending you're something like,</v>

3151
02:09:32.170 --> 02:09:34.810
<v Speaker 2>look at how many fucking people pretend</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're native American because it makes</v>

3152
02:09:34.811 --> 02:09:36.700
<v Speaker 2>them seem more spiritual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>

3153
02:09:36.701 --> 02:09:37.850
<v Speaker 2>that's always been an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3154
02:09:38.040 --> 02:09:38.873
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is.</v>

3155
02:09:39.520 --> 02:09:40.930
<v Speaker 2>Elizabeth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why was just trying to remember her</v>

3156
02:09:40.931 --> 02:09:42.790
<v Speaker 2>name?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is she gonna I wonder if she's going to</v>

3157
02:09:42.791 --> 02:09:43.624
<v Speaker 2>run in 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20.</v>

3158
02:09:43.730 --> 02:09:45.170
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3159
02:09:45.320 --> 02:09:48.910
<v Speaker 2>The allied and said you were part native</v>
<v Speaker 2>American to get some sort of</v>

3160
02:09:49.030 --> 02:09:50.130
<v Speaker 2>scholarship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

3161
02:09:50.140 --> 02:09:51.200
<v Speaker 2>Harvard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't it?</v>

3162
02:09:51.520 --> 02:09:52.870
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at that.</v>

3163
02:09:53.310 --> 02:09:55.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will say this.</v>

3164
02:09:55.350 --> 02:09:58.230
<v Speaker 2>The world is so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>After a,</v>

3165
02:09:58.990 --> 02:09:59.751
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

3166
02:09:59.751 --> 02:10:01.930
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we went into Iraq in 2003,</v>

3167
02:10:01.970 --> 02:10:03.940
<v Speaker 2>early 2003,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3168
02:10:05.200 --> 02:10:08.650
<v Speaker 2>people started looking at the business</v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunities that rock.</v>

3169
02:10:08.650 --> 02:10:10.480
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I remember there was that whole</v>

3170
02:10:11.500 --> 02:10:12.340
<v Speaker 2>idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>excuse me,</v>

3171
02:10:12.341 --> 02:10:16.990
<v Speaker 2>that there was gonna be all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 2>business opening up in Iraq because I</v>

3172
02:10:16.991 --> 02:10:18.910
<v Speaker 2>don't know why they were thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

3173
02:10:19.270 --> 02:10:22.660
<v Speaker 2>so then it became people looking for</v>
<v Speaker 2>contracts,</v>

3174
02:10:22.690 --> 02:10:25.240
<v Speaker 2>government contracts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>commercial sector contracts to do</v>

3175
02:10:25.241 --> 02:10:28.480
<v Speaker 2>business in Iraq.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the idea was suddenly there was a</v>

3176
02:10:28.481 --> 02:10:33.481
<v Speaker 2>mad rush to open up a minority owned and</v>
<v Speaker 2>veteran owned and</v>

3177
02:10:37.140 --> 02:10:41.640
<v Speaker 2>women owned businesses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the idea was if you had a,</v>

3178
02:10:42.380 --> 02:10:44.160
<v Speaker 2>like an annual Indian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3179
02:10:44.210 --> 02:10:48.500
<v Speaker 2>Eskimo who was supposedly in charge of</v>
<v Speaker 2>your business that gave you extra points</v>

3180
02:10:48.501 --> 02:10:51.680
<v Speaker 2>when you were weighed in the bid for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>contract that you were going for.</v>

3181
02:10:51.980 --> 02:10:54.160
<v Speaker 2>So there became this cottage industry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3182
02:10:54.170 --> 02:10:58.550
<v Speaker 2>much like the casino business of trying</v>
<v Speaker 2>to find tribes that you can represent in</v>

3183
02:10:58.551 --> 02:11:02.960
<v Speaker 2>order for them to end to open up a and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're creating essentially a tribe to</v>

3184
02:11:03.170 --> 02:11:04.100
<v Speaker 2>have a casino.</v>

3185
02:11:04.620 --> 02:11:06.580
<v Speaker 2>It gives them a certain advantages</v>
<v Speaker 2>which.</v>

3186
02:11:06.830 --> 02:11:07.940
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an interesting,</v>

3187
02:11:07.941 --> 02:11:11.280
<v Speaker 2>it's an interesting world we live in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well the native American casino business</v>

3188
02:11:11.281 --> 02:11:15.740
<v Speaker 2>is very weird in that regard and also</v>
<v Speaker 2>that a lot of people in these areas,</v>

3189
02:11:15.741 --> 02:11:19.700
<v Speaker 2>because there are certain percentage and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's as little as one slash 16th</v>

3190
02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.400
<v Speaker 2>native American,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can get a check.</v>

3191
02:11:22.820 --> 02:11:25.640
<v Speaker 2>So like if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the casinos raking in the cash,</v>

3192
02:11:25.730 --> 02:11:29.030
<v Speaker 2>the people that are a part of that tribe</v>
<v Speaker 2>all get free money.</v>

3193
02:11:29.080 --> 02:11:31.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So these casinos are just generating</v>

3194
02:11:31.341 --> 02:11:34.820
<v Speaker 2>like fucking billions of dollars a year</v>
<v Speaker 2>that just because someone,</v>

3195
02:11:34.830 --> 02:11:36.420
<v Speaker 2>some of them require,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of them are cow,</v>

3196
02:11:36.421 --> 02:11:37.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>marginal.</v>

3197
02:11:37.100 --> 02:11:37.960
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

3198
02:11:37.970 --> 02:11:39.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are a number of them that do,</v>

3199
02:11:39.400 --> 02:11:40.750
<v Speaker 2>do very well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

3200
02:11:40.760 --> 02:11:42.650
<v Speaker 2>wasn't for some of these.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about you,</v>

3201
02:11:42.651 --> 02:11:44.720
<v Speaker 2>but some of the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tell you what,</v>

3202
02:11:44.750 --> 02:11:47.720
<v Speaker 2>I want to be depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to,</v>

3203
02:11:47.810 --> 02:11:49.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's certain Indian reservations in</v>

3204
02:11:49.941 --> 02:11:51.680
<v Speaker 2>this country that are just awful.</v>

3205
02:11:51.830 --> 02:11:53.150
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love her.</v>

3206
02:11:53.151 --> 02:11:56.060
<v Speaker 2>Poverty is just alcoholism down and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and.</v>

3207
02:11:56.061 --> 02:11:56.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

3208
02:11:56.670 --> 02:12:00.620
<v Speaker 2>Substance Abuse and lack of opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lack of educational facilities for the</v>

3209
02:12:00.621 --> 02:12:04.240
<v Speaker 2>kids and that's just not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not right.</v>

3210
02:12:04.650 --> 02:12:07.550
<v Speaker 2>We should do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should be far better than that.</v>

3211
02:12:07.580 --> 02:12:12.580
<v Speaker 2>There should not be a native American</v>
<v Speaker 2>foundations are very strange when you</v>

3212
02:12:13.131 --> 02:12:16.610
<v Speaker 2>think about like how long ago it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these tribes,</v>

3213
02:12:16.611 --> 02:12:21.611
<v Speaker 2>people were roaming the earth and</v>
<v Speaker 2>nomadic fashion and living the life they</v>

3214
02:12:22.011 --> 02:12:27.011
<v Speaker 2>did before the Europeans came and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>now they've become this segmented part</v>

3215
02:12:27.351 --> 02:12:31.700
<v Speaker 2>of our population that's sort of a part</v>
<v Speaker 2>of America but has their own kind of</v>

3216
02:12:31.701 --> 02:12:36.701
<v Speaker 2>like nation inside of a nation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was weird rules like the way they</v>

3217
02:12:36.951 --> 02:12:39.320
<v Speaker 2>have it up in Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they call them first nation people,</v>

3218
02:12:39.650 --> 02:12:43.400
<v Speaker 2>but in candidates real weird in regards</v>
<v Speaker 2>to wildlife,</v>

3219
02:12:43.640 --> 02:12:45.200
<v Speaker 2>like I don't know if you know how it</v>
<v Speaker 2>works up there,</v>

3220
02:12:45.201 --> 02:12:49.010
<v Speaker 2>but they can shoot anything they want</v>
<v Speaker 2>all year round and they have it that way</v>

3221
02:12:49.011 --> 02:12:52.880
<v Speaker 2>in Washington state as well with elk</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunt elk all year round.</v>

3222
02:12:53.060 --> 02:12:55.340
<v Speaker 2>The rules are so different things the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same way.</v>

3223
02:12:55.360 --> 02:13:00.290
<v Speaker 2>They use spotlights for Moose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like they drive at night with four by</v>

3224
02:13:00.291 --> 02:13:02.630
<v Speaker 2>fours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Moose see the spotlight,</v>

3225
02:13:02.631 --> 02:13:04.490
<v Speaker 2>they freeze,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they belong away with high powered</v>

3226
02:13:04.491 --> 02:13:08.280
<v Speaker 2>rifles and they can kill him as many as</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want all year round the same.</v>

3227
02:13:08.390 --> 02:13:12.230
<v Speaker 2>If we used to go spotlighting kangaroos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lived in Australia when I was younger,</v>

3228
02:13:12.260 --> 02:13:16.280
<v Speaker 2>were stationed in England,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Australia.</v>

3229
02:13:16.850 --> 02:13:19.480
<v Speaker 2>I've lived in a lot of places,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm now in my.</v>

3230
02:13:19.570 --> 02:13:21.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm in my last place now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Idaho.</v>

3231
02:13:21.690 --> 02:13:22.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never moved.</v>

3232
02:13:23.180 --> 02:13:25.800
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah we used to go in Australia,</v>

3233
02:13:26.180 --> 02:13:28.310
<v Speaker 2>worked on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lived on a sheep station out there,</v>

3234
02:13:28.610 --> 02:13:33.120
<v Speaker 2>massive property and we get into the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the truck with the spotlights.</v>

3235
02:13:33.121 --> 02:13:36.150
<v Speaker 2>And you go out and those kangaroos are</v>
<v Speaker 2>hard as shit to hit.</v>

3236
02:13:36.330 --> 02:13:37.680
<v Speaker 2>They are tough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Haunting.</v>

3237
02:13:37.710 --> 02:13:39.450
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You guys doing that for population</v>

3238
02:13:39.451 --> 02:13:40.284
<v Speaker 2>control?</v>

3239
02:13:40.320 --> 02:13:41.860
<v Speaker 2>Many of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3240
02:13:42.430 --> 02:13:43.051
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3241
02:13:43.051 --> 02:13:44.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean this would be delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3242
02:13:44.740 --> 02:13:46.120
<v Speaker 2>it can be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3243
02:13:46.140 --> 02:13:48.650
<v Speaker 2>depending on how old they are and which</v>
<v Speaker 2>high.</v>

3244
02:13:48.760 --> 02:13:49.960
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the uh,</v>

3245
02:13:50.250 --> 02:13:53.460
<v Speaker 2>the tail is actually the tastiest part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why Kangaroo tail?</v>

3246
02:13:53.500 --> 02:13:54.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3247
02:13:54.110 --> 02:13:56.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about all that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>

3248
02:13:56.071 --> 02:13:58.590
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean the ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the tail tail because it</v>

3249
02:13:58.591 --> 02:14:02.970
<v Speaker 2>balances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I've seen the idea you go in real</v>

3250
02:14:02.971 --> 02:14:03.721
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3251
02:14:03.721 --> 02:14:04.441
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but anyway,</v>

3252
02:14:04.441 --> 02:14:06.630
<v Speaker 2>they are hard to hit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are completely unpredictable in</v>

3253
02:14:06.631 --> 02:14:10.380
<v Speaker 2>their movement and they just uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they move fast and they,</v>

3254
02:14:10.381 --> 02:14:12.210
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they jump the fences,</v>

3255
02:14:12.211 --> 02:14:13.830
<v Speaker 2>they can clear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's impressive.</v>

3256
02:14:14.480 --> 02:14:18.990
<v Speaker 2>I know why I'm talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we played a video inviting these massive</v>

3257
02:14:18.991 --> 02:14:21.090
<v Speaker 2>herds or packs or whatever you call</v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

3258
02:14:21.091 --> 02:14:24.600
<v Speaker 2>of kangaroos roaming across the field.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like some people have no idea what the</v>

3259
02:14:24.601 --> 02:14:25.700
<v Speaker 2>numbers are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3260
02:14:25.740 --> 02:14:28.260
<v Speaker 2>I have friends that live in Australia</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they tell me like there's places</v>

3261
02:14:28.261 --> 02:14:30.440
<v Speaker 2>that are just infested and there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing they can do.</v>

3262
02:14:30.460 --> 02:14:31.730
<v Speaker 2>They don't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they,</v>

3263
02:14:31.780 --> 02:14:34.590
<v Speaker 2>they literally have to gun them down</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's no predators.</v>

3264
02:14:34.640 --> 02:14:35.640
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3265
02:14:35.641 --> 02:14:37.770
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean when he got dingoes not going to</v>

3266
02:14:37.771 --> 02:14:38.990
<v Speaker 2>bring down a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3267
02:14:39.030 --> 02:14:40.500
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a kangaroo,</v>

3268
02:14:40.740 --> 02:14:42.100
<v Speaker 2>good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Feral cat and you know,</v>

3269
02:14:42.330 --> 02:14:43.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's.</v>

3270
02:14:43.950 --> 02:14:44.783
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this,</v>

3271
02:14:45.170 --> 02:14:46.710
<v Speaker 2>they just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all over the place.</v>

3272
02:14:46.780 --> 02:14:50.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm great little animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

3273
02:14:50.570 --> 02:14:52.270
<v Speaker 2>they're kind of cute and they're tasty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Know,</v>

3274
02:14:52.280 --> 02:14:54.660
<v Speaker 2>look at these fuckers go bouncing all</v>
<v Speaker 2>over the place.</v>

3275
02:14:58.410 --> 02:15:01.850
<v Speaker 2>A kangaroo call starts that Jesus</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christ.</v>

3276
02:15:01.890 --> 02:15:04.800
<v Speaker 2>So many of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Oh,</v>

3277
02:15:05.010 --> 02:15:07.350
<v Speaker 2>people were upset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess people were upset at the</v>

3278
02:15:07.351 --> 02:15:11.450
<v Speaker 2>kangaroo call was going to have that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3279
02:15:11.520 --> 02:15:13.240
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ellen got stuck in a fence.</v>

3280
02:15:13.350 --> 02:15:14.880
<v Speaker 2>That's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3281
02:15:14.881 --> 02:15:18.390
<v Speaker 2>I mean whenever you have an animal that</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't have any sort of a natural</v>

3282
02:15:18.391 --> 02:15:21.180
<v Speaker 2>predator and they can just free free</v>
<v Speaker 2>ball it.</v>

3283
02:15:21.240 --> 02:15:22.073
<v Speaker 2>Exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3284
02:15:22.200 --> 02:15:23.970
<v Speaker 2>That's what they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they and Australia is such an</v>

3285
02:15:23.971 --> 02:15:24.900
<v Speaker 2>interesting place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3286
02:15:24.901 --> 02:15:29.660
<v Speaker 2>every time they introduce a species to</v>
<v Speaker 2>try to solve a problem that's pcs takes</v>

3287
02:15:29.700 --> 02:15:30.301
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3288
02:15:30.301 --> 02:15:30.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just,</v>

3289
02:15:30.960 --> 02:15:32.490
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's never ending.</v>

3290
02:15:32.700 --> 02:15:35.490
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to explain to someone the</v>
<v Speaker 2>other day about the cats there.</v>

3291
02:15:35.670 --> 02:15:36.421
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That they,</v>

3292
02:15:36.421 --> 02:15:39.630
<v Speaker 2>they hunt cats like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what we think of as a pet.</v>

3293
02:15:39.810 --> 02:15:41.010
<v Speaker 2>And they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

3294
02:15:41.630 --> 02:15:42.570
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

3295
02:15:43.170 --> 02:15:47.940
<v Speaker 2>I know it doesn't seem right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the feral cat population is just run</v>

3296
02:15:47.941 --> 02:15:48.660
<v Speaker 2>out of control.</v>

3297
02:15:48.660 --> 02:15:53.240
<v Speaker 2>Like we did a podcast once we pulled up</v>
<v Speaker 2>the feral cat population in America and</v>

3298
02:15:53.250 --> 02:15:58.250
<v Speaker 2>what it does that they killed billions</v>
<v Speaker 2>of birds and rodents in America.</v>

3299
02:15:59.890 --> 02:16:00.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And someone was like,</v>

3300
02:16:01.050 --> 02:16:01.860
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that can't be right.</v>

3301
02:16:01.860 --> 02:16:02.693
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

3302
02:16:02.790 --> 02:16:04.590
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the scientists who did the study of</v>

3303
02:16:04.591 --> 02:16:07.650
<v Speaker 2>shocked cats are fucking murderers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3304
02:16:08.070 --> 02:16:10.740
<v Speaker 2>And we had a cat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a great cat named Charlie who's now</v>

3305
02:16:10.741 --> 02:16:12.160
<v Speaker 2>died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3306
02:16:12.450 --> 02:16:15.030
<v Speaker 2>but he was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was not to a captain most part,</v>

3307
02:16:15.031 --> 02:16:16.000
<v Speaker 2>but he would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3308
02:16:16.200 --> 02:16:21.200
<v Speaker 2>he would kill chipmunks and he would lay</v>
<v Speaker 2>the chipmunks out in a row to get</v>

3309
02:16:21.390 --> 02:16:22.223
<v Speaker 2>offering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3310
02:16:22.320 --> 02:16:24.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was incredibly efficient.</v>

3311
02:16:24.571 --> 02:16:25.920
<v Speaker 2>We try to keep them indoors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

3312
02:16:25.921 --> 02:16:27.450
<v Speaker 2>the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just wanted to be outside killing</v>

3313
02:16:27.451 --> 02:16:30.070
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so just fun time and then come in and</v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3321
02:16:39.101 --> 02:16:41.650
<v Speaker 2>you'd be out repairing fences or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something and yeah,</v>

3322
02:16:41.680 --> 02:16:45.520
<v Speaker 2>you just kinda get off or they'd spook</v>
<v Speaker 2>the horses or you'd get to put your hand</v>

3323
02:16:45.521 --> 02:16:48.160
<v Speaker 2>down to Pixar and Bob,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just come out of nowhere and</v>

3324
02:16:48.161 --> 02:16:49.870
<v Speaker 2>they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're bastards.</v>

3325
02:16:50.120 --> 02:16:51.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not kitty,</v>

3326
02:16:52.100 --> 02:16:53.680
<v Speaker 2>kitty cats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hello Kitty.</v>

3327
02:16:53.740 --> 02:16:56.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like a wild small Predator</v>

3328
02:16:56.261 --> 02:17:00.490
<v Speaker 2>that's extremely vicious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

3329
02:17:00.520 --> 02:17:05.320
<v Speaker 2>they killed things all the time though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The feral cat problem in the United</v>

3330
02:17:05.320 --> 02:17:09.190
<v Speaker 2>States is insignificant in comparison to</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it does in Australia though.</v>

3331
02:17:09.400 --> 02:17:11.620
<v Speaker 2>Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have devastated ground nesting</v>

3332
02:17:11.621 --> 02:17:15.130
<v Speaker 2>birds and all sorts of other species</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're an invasive species and</v>

3333
02:17:15.131 --> 02:17:15.791
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

3334
02:17:15.791 --> 02:17:17.710
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing really good dingoes</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>

3335
02:17:17.711 --> 02:17:19.510
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's that then I can't get a</v>

3336
02:17:19.511 --> 02:17:20.470
<v Speaker 2>deputation is now.</v>

3337
02:17:20.740 --> 02:17:22.720
<v Speaker 2>So it didn't go it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My baby,</v>

3338
02:17:23.470 --> 02:17:25.780
<v Speaker 2>where you live is fascinating because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got,</v>

3339
02:17:25.810 --> 02:17:28.390
<v Speaker 2>you've got everything up there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got grizzly bears.</v>

3340
02:17:28.450 --> 02:17:29.201
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You gotTa,</v>

3341
02:17:29.201 --> 02:17:31.180
<v Speaker 2>you gotta get a healthy grizzly</v>
<v Speaker 2>population.</v>

3342
02:17:31.181 --> 02:17:34.450
<v Speaker 2>I have a buddy who went black bear</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunting up there and they could not find</v>

3343
02:17:34.451 --> 02:17:36.590
<v Speaker 2>black bears.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They found board grizzlies.</v>

3344
02:17:36.990 --> 02:17:39.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They start grizzly after grizzly after</v>

3345
02:17:39.401 --> 02:17:40.510
<v Speaker 2>grizzly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

3346
02:17:40.511 --> 02:17:41.021
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>

3347
02:17:41.021 --> 02:17:42.940
<v Speaker 2>and it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's such a good thing.</v>

3348
02:17:43.030 --> 02:17:45.200
<v Speaker 2>And when you see the sort of the health</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the,</v>

3349
02:17:45.201 --> 02:17:48.460
<v Speaker 2>of the wildlife population and just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes you feel really good,</v>

3350
02:17:48.461 --> 02:17:50.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

3351
02:17:51.250 --> 02:17:52.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to explain.</v>

3352
02:17:52.451 --> 02:17:53.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

3353
02:17:53.140 --> 02:17:55.860
<v Speaker 2>I was up in yellowstone and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

3354
02:17:55.990 --> 02:17:59.110
<v Speaker 2>once again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm always amazed at how people interact</v>

3355
02:17:59.111 --> 02:18:00.760
<v Speaker 2>with wildlife when they're not used to</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

3356
02:18:00.860 --> 02:18:02.590
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Yellowstone is probably the best</v>

3357
02:18:02.591 --> 02:18:07.591
<v Speaker 2>place to see that happen because there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>so many tourists during the busy time of</v>

3358
02:18:08.141 --> 02:18:12.820
<v Speaker 2>year and they'll just say there's no</v>
<v Speaker 2>regard for the fact that it's a wild</v>

3359
02:18:12.821 --> 02:18:13.420
<v Speaker 2>animal.</v>

3360
02:18:13.420 --> 02:18:15.850
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even the Bison and the price will</v>

3361
02:18:15.930 --> 02:18:19.600
<v Speaker 2>kill you in a hot second if they get</v>
<v Speaker 2>pissed off and you'll get these</v>

3362
02:18:19.601 --> 02:18:22.690
<v Speaker 2>tourists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll get out of that car and you know,</v>

3363
02:18:22.691 --> 02:18:23.251
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3364
02:18:23.251 --> 02:18:24.850
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the husband will be taking a picture and</v>

3365
02:18:24.851 --> 02:18:26.140
<v Speaker 2>telling his wife to get a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 2>closer,</v>

3366
02:18:26.180 --> 02:18:28.330
<v Speaker 2>get closer right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he's doing it deliberately,</v>

3367
02:18:28.331 --> 02:18:28.790
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

3368
02:18:28.790 --> 02:18:30.500
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

3369
02:18:30.510 --> 02:18:32.400
<v Speaker 2>it's an amazing thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

3370
02:18:32.640 --> 02:18:34.750
<v Speaker 2>she looks fine and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3371
02:18:34.780 --> 02:18:35.920
<v Speaker 2>but it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an amazing.</v>

3372
02:18:35.921 --> 02:18:38.890
<v Speaker 2>That's another place for people if they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they haven't been to yellowstone,</v>

3373
02:18:38.891 --> 02:18:42.370
<v Speaker 2>go to yellowstone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What seems like a zoo to people,</v>

3374
02:18:42.430 --> 02:18:43.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see these gigantic,</v>

3375
02:18:43.751 --> 02:18:46.570
<v Speaker 2>furry star wars looking things out</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

3376
02:18:46.630 --> 02:18:48.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what a buffalo it looks like when</v>

3377
02:18:48.341 --> 02:18:50.640
<v Speaker 2>you see it real life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that real?</v>

3378
02:18:50.680 --> 02:18:52.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're so big.</v>

3379
02:18:52.450 --> 02:18:53.440
<v Speaker 2>They are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have massive.</v>

3380
02:18:53.441 --> 02:18:57.100
<v Speaker 2>And then we were in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were there and at one point was,</v>

3381
02:18:57.340 --> 02:19:01.840
<v Speaker 2>it was getting to be twilight and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>came around a corner and I was with a</v>

3382
02:19:01.900 --> 02:19:04.760
<v Speaker 2>couple of the rangers and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

3383
02:19:06.310 --> 02:19:09.040
<v Speaker 2>there was a vehicle stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a,</v>

3384
02:19:09.100 --> 02:19:10.240
<v Speaker 2>what do they call it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A minivan.</v>

3385
02:19:10.540 --> 02:19:14.410
<v Speaker 2>And it was stopped on the side of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>road and there were half a dozen people</v>

3386
02:19:14.411 --> 02:19:17.470
<v Speaker 2>out of this minivan and they work all</v>
<v Speaker 2>kinds of fussing about,</v>

3387
02:19:17.530 --> 02:19:20.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it just a little bit in the field</v>

3388
02:19:20.560 --> 02:19:24.220
<v Speaker 2>they're on the side and think what are</v>
<v Speaker 2>they doing?</v>

3389
02:19:24.340 --> 02:19:27.170
<v Speaker 2>And then it became clear that there was</v>
<v Speaker 2>little calf out there.</v>

3390
02:19:27.200 --> 02:19:28.033
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>little</v>

3391
02:19:28.140 --> 02:19:31.040
<v Speaker 3>license calf.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was gotten separated from the herd</v>

3392
02:19:31.550 --> 02:19:33.920
<v Speaker 3>and I guess they had seen it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it now you could hear it.</v>

3393
02:19:33.921 --> 02:19:35.200
<v Speaker 3>It was kinda over there bleeding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

3394
02:19:35.201 --> 02:19:36.260
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

3395
02:19:36.261 --> 02:19:37.940
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they wanted to get it.</v>

3396
02:19:37.941 --> 02:19:39.260
<v Speaker 3>They wanted to wrap it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Meaning bleeding.</v>

3397
02:19:39.300 --> 02:19:40.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They make noise.</v>

3398
02:19:40.520 --> 02:19:40.941
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3399
02:19:40.941 --> 02:19:41.331
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not,</v>

3400
02:19:41.331 --> 02:19:42.920
<v Speaker 3>not bleeding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3401
02:19:42.950 --> 02:19:44.960
<v Speaker 3>although that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was probably the next step in this</v>

3402
02:19:45.710 --> 02:19:47.360
<v Speaker 3>evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3403
02:19:47.420 --> 02:19:48.740
<v Speaker 3>was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were,</v>

3404
02:19:48.770 --> 02:19:52.290
<v Speaker 3>they were trying to figure out how to</v>
<v Speaker 3>round it up and get it back to its.</v>

3405
02:19:53.810 --> 02:19:54.820
<v Speaker 3>And the Rangers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3406
02:19:54.830 --> 02:19:55.663
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3407
02:19:55.850 --> 02:19:56.720
<v Speaker 3>here we go again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

3408
02:19:57.120 --> 02:19:58.130
<v Speaker 3>and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

3409
02:19:58.131 --> 02:20:01.040
<v Speaker 3>this happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unfortunately people don't realize it's</v>

3410
02:20:01.041 --> 02:20:02.450
<v Speaker 3>nature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they had to get out.</v>

3411
02:20:02.451 --> 02:20:05.000
<v Speaker 3>And I stood there and listened while</v>
<v Speaker 3>they explain these people,</v>

3412
02:20:05.001 --> 02:20:07.880
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this calf is somebody's dinner now,</v>

3413
02:20:08.120 --> 02:20:09.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be,</v>

3414
02:20:09.400 --> 02:20:13.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>found and devoured by other forces of</v>

3415
02:20:13.371 --> 02:20:14.010
<v Speaker 3>nature out.</v>

3416
02:20:14.010 --> 02:20:15.170
<v Speaker 3>Luckily wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3417
02:20:15.230 --> 02:20:17.690
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's a wolf population is coming</v>

3418
02:20:17.691 --> 02:20:18.890
<v Speaker 3>back up there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is great.</v>

3419
02:20:19.310 --> 02:20:21.530
<v Speaker 3>And so these people were horrified.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were,</v>

3420
02:20:21.560 --> 02:20:23.660
<v Speaker 3>they were amazed at the rangers wouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>do something like,</v>

3421
02:20:23.690 --> 02:20:27.500
<v Speaker 3>I guess catch the calf,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put it in the back of the truck and</v>

3422
02:20:27.501 --> 02:20:30.110
<v Speaker 3>drive it to the ticket to the zoo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take it to the zoo or take it to the</v>

3423
02:20:30.111 --> 02:20:33.470
<v Speaker 3>herd or take it home and bottle feed it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not much you can do.</v>

3424
02:20:33.471 --> 02:20:35.540
<v Speaker 3>And most likely if it's mother left it</v>
<v Speaker 3>behind,</v>

3425
02:20:35.541 --> 02:20:38.000
<v Speaker 3>maybe there's something wrong with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>mother as well.</v>

3426
02:20:38.760 --> 02:20:39.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3427
02:20:39.360 --> 02:20:40.290
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows what the,</v>

3428
02:20:40.310 --> 02:20:41.990
<v Speaker 3>what the reasoning was behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it was,</v>

3429
02:20:42.230 --> 02:20:43.850
<v Speaker 3>it was interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a good lesson.</v>

3430
02:20:44.840 --> 02:20:47.480
<v Speaker 3>But that place is that the park system</v>
<v Speaker 3>anyway,</v>

3431
02:20:47.510 --> 02:20:51.080
<v Speaker 3>I think we've talked about that before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just astounding in this amazing.</v>

3432
02:20:51.110 --> 02:20:51.710
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

3433
02:20:51.710 --> 02:20:53.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the natural,</v>

3434
02:20:53.101 --> 02:20:53.790
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3435
02:20:53.790 --> 02:20:56.050
<v Speaker 3>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rather the national parks that,</v>

3436
02:20:56.051 --> 02:20:57.140
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we have,</v>

3437
02:20:57.220 --> 02:20:57.710
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

3438
02:20:57.710 --> 02:21:00.570
<v Speaker 3>in Idaho in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you guys have a lot of public ally</v>

3439
02:21:00.730 --> 02:21:01.600
<v Speaker 3>wilderness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3440
02:21:01.610 --> 02:21:02.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>into the Frank Church.</v>

3441
02:21:02.781 --> 02:21:06.130
<v Speaker 3>Wildernesses insane the size.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3442
02:21:06.230 --> 02:21:09.920
<v Speaker 3>I've read a really good book called the</v>
<v Speaker 3>big burn if anybody's looking for a book</v>

3443
02:21:09.921 --> 02:21:14.540
<v Speaker 3>to pick up and read,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's about this massive forest fire that</v>

3444
02:21:14.541 --> 02:21:18.350
<v Speaker 3>took place mostly in Idaho and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3445
02:21:18.890 --> 02:21:20.630
<v Speaker 3>during the course of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3446
02:21:20.840 --> 02:21:23.130
<v Speaker 3>of Teddy Roosevelt's time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it also,</v>

3447
02:21:23.180 --> 02:21:25.380
<v Speaker 3>it also covers Teddy Roosevelt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3448
02:21:25.940 --> 02:21:30.940
<v Speaker 3>and his efforts and the way that he got</v>
<v Speaker 3>turned on to conservation.</v>

3449
02:21:31.850 --> 02:21:35.750
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the beginnings of the firefighting,</v>

3450
02:21:35.890 --> 02:21:36.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3451
02:21:37.010 --> 02:21:42.010
<v Speaker 3>profession a forest fires.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's a fascinating read.</v>

3452
02:21:42.170 --> 02:21:42.921
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think about it,</v>

3453
02:21:42.921 --> 02:21:43.731
<v Speaker 3>people are going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>

3454
02:21:43.731 --> 02:21:45.200
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to read a book about a big</v>
<v Speaker 3>forest fire,</v>

3455
02:21:45.380 --> 02:21:46.460
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's incredible.</v>

3456
02:21:46.460 --> 02:21:49.250
<v Speaker 3>And they weave in the history and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>time of the administration and how they</v>

3457
02:21:49.251 --> 02:21:53.720
<v Speaker 3>were declaring parks and what they were</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing and how they tried to tackle this</v>

3458
02:21:53.721 --> 02:21:56.500
<v Speaker 3>fire and what that meant for future</v>
<v Speaker 3>conservation term.</v>

3459
02:21:56.530 --> 02:21:57.260
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>

3460
02:21:57.260 --> 02:21:58.610
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a fascinating book,</v>

3461
02:21:58.611 --> 02:22:01.040
<v Speaker 3>so it's called the big burn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm drawing a blank on who wrote it,</v>

3462
02:22:01.430 --> 02:22:03.680
<v Speaker 3>but if anybody's out there listening and</v>
<v Speaker 3>wants to book,</v>

3463
02:22:03.740 --> 02:22:06.170
<v Speaker 3>pick it up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how did they try to stop a fire back</v>

3464
02:22:06.171 --> 02:22:08.390
<v Speaker 3>then?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially a massive wildfire,</v>

3465
02:22:08.420 --> 02:22:10.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing a lot of the same things that they</v>

3466
02:22:10.671 --> 02:22:11.620
<v Speaker 3>do now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3467
02:22:11.630 --> 02:22:15.680
<v Speaker 3>Cutting lines and breaks and trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>deprive it of fuel,</v>

3468
02:22:15.681 --> 02:22:18.210
<v Speaker 3>feeding it back on itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3469
02:22:18.980 --> 02:22:19.880
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3470
02:22:20.120 --> 02:22:25.050
<v Speaker 3>just manpower,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just sheer manpower and trying to um,</v>

3471
02:22:25.290 --> 02:22:26.130
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>putting up</v>

3472
02:22:26.140 --> 02:22:27.780
<v Speaker 2>the smoke towers and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3473
02:22:27.781 --> 02:22:28.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>creating a,</v>

3474
02:22:28.811 --> 02:22:32.130
<v Speaker 2>back then that's what they were doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were just out in the middle of</v>

3475
02:22:32.131 --> 02:22:32.870
<v Speaker 2>nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You try to,</v>

3476
02:22:32.870 --> 02:22:34.970
<v Speaker 2>you try to space out these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

3477
02:22:34.971 --> 02:22:36.180
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>outposts,</v>

3478
02:22:36.181 --> 02:22:40.680
<v Speaker 2>these little points on a top of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>mountains where you can identify smoke</v>

3479
02:22:40.681 --> 02:22:42.390
<v Speaker 2>and try to catch it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3480
02:22:42.391 --> 02:22:44.370
<v Speaker 2>like if you've got an electrical storm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>

3481
02:22:44.371 --> 02:22:46.830
<v Speaker 2>then all of a sudden you see some smoke</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you realize you probably got to</v>

3482
02:22:46.831 --> 02:22:48.660
<v Speaker 2>start a fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to get on it as quick as</v>

3483
02:22:48.661 --> 02:22:50.730
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then nowadays you'll call and the</v>

3484
02:22:50.731 --> 02:22:53.160
<v Speaker 2>smoke jumpers and they'll go in and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an insane job,</v>

3485
02:22:53.470 --> 02:22:55.590
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to try to contain it,</v>

3486
02:22:55.591 --> 02:22:57.390
<v Speaker 2>put it out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's always been debate.</v>

3487
02:22:57.450 --> 02:22:58.830
<v Speaker 2>What do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you let it burn,</v>

3488
02:22:58.831 --> 02:23:00.000
<v Speaker 2>do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you,</v>

3489
02:23:00.390 --> 02:23:03.630
<v Speaker 2>how do you deal with it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Depends on the weather forecast as well.</v>

3490
02:23:03.690 --> 02:23:08.170
<v Speaker 2>Weather forecast and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of it was politics and it was me</v>

3491
02:23:08.220 --> 02:23:11.250
<v Speaker 2>back then in Roosevelt's time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was all the timber barons,</v>

3492
02:23:11.251 --> 02:23:13.410
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the mining barons and the railroad</v>

3493
02:23:13.411 --> 02:23:17.550
<v Speaker 2>barons and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they weren't interested in,</v>

3494
02:23:17.551 --> 02:23:21.000
<v Speaker 2>in Roosevelt's idea of claiming land for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the public.</v>

3495
02:23:21.630 --> 02:23:23.280
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>

3496
02:23:23.760 --> 02:23:24.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

3497
02:23:24.440 --> 02:23:26.790
<v Speaker 2>it was so fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a fascinating read.</v>

3498
02:23:26.850 --> 02:23:28.710
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of go back to that same thing that</v>

3499
02:23:28.711 --> 02:23:30.660
<v Speaker 2>we talked about it before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how did this nation could cobbled</v>

3500
02:23:30.661 --> 02:23:32.850
<v Speaker 2>together and how did it end up looking</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way it looked?</v>

3501
02:23:32.851 --> 02:23:35.490
<v Speaker 2>And Roosevelt had some real vision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He really did.</v>

3502
02:23:35.491 --> 02:23:38.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're so thankful we should be so</v>

3503
02:23:38.341 --> 02:23:42.640
<v Speaker 2>thankful because of that vision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have this incredible national park</v>

3504
02:23:42.641 --> 02:23:46.140
<v Speaker 2>system and all this public land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talked to a wildlife biologist who</v>

3505
02:23:46.141 --> 02:23:50.340
<v Speaker 2>said that that's one of the reasons why</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have all these issues with like bark</v>

3506
02:23:50.341 --> 02:23:53.820
<v Speaker 2>beetles and all these different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a dead tree issues that when we get a</v>

3507
02:23:53.821 --> 02:23:57.330
<v Speaker 2>forest fire today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like so out of control because we</v>

3508
02:23:57.331 --> 02:24:01.560
<v Speaker 2>don't allow these burns to take place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which they do naturally in nature.</v>

3509
02:24:01.620 --> 02:24:02.171
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3510
02:24:02.171 --> 02:24:04.590
<v Speaker 2>And that's part of it because you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine what happens if you,</v>

3511
02:24:05.040 --> 02:24:07.350
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't do that,</v>

3512
02:24:07.351 --> 02:24:09.990
<v Speaker 2>you develop the fuel over a long period</v>
<v Speaker 2>of time,</v>

3513
02:24:10.260 --> 02:24:12.150
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you get a devastating fire.</v>

3514
02:24:13.050 --> 02:24:15.240
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and also apparently the carbon from</v>

3515
02:24:15.241 --> 02:24:17.490
<v Speaker 2>those trees burning is actually good for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ground.</v>

3516
02:24:17.491 --> 02:24:19.260
<v Speaker 2>The soil it didn't know it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very,</v>

3517
02:24:19.261 --> 02:24:22.230
<v Speaker 2>it's the ability of the land to bounce</v>
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>

3518
02:24:22.810 --> 02:24:26.700
<v Speaker 2>We see it in not all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you get up in Montana and in other</v>

3519
02:24:26.701 --> 02:24:27.720
<v Speaker 2>parts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>parts of Wyoming,</v>

3520
02:24:27.721 --> 02:24:29.390
<v Speaker 2>you see how quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3521
02:24:29.400 --> 02:24:31.170
<v Speaker 2>the environment can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can bounce back.</v>

3522
02:24:31.320 --> 02:24:35.100
<v Speaker 2>And how often do you see like wolves and</v>
<v Speaker 2>grizzlies and stuff like that where you</v>

3523
02:24:35.101 --> 02:24:38.880
<v Speaker 2>are</v>
<v Speaker 2>wolves more than than grizzlies.</v>

3524
02:24:38.881 --> 02:24:39.920
<v Speaker 2>The grizzlies is still.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3525
02:24:39.930 --> 02:24:40.820
<v Speaker 2>they'll still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

3526
02:24:40.980 --> 02:24:42.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll try to keep to themselves.</v>

3527
02:24:43.160 --> 02:24:44.300
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

3528
02:24:44.460 --> 02:24:45.840
<v Speaker 2>but you're seeing a ton of elk.</v>

3529
02:24:45.870 --> 02:24:47.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>More wolves.</v>

3530
02:24:47.850 --> 02:24:49.680
<v Speaker 2>We had a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's got coyotes,</v>

3531
02:24:50.390 --> 02:24:53.490
<v Speaker 2>so they're so resilient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are like the cockroach of the</v>

3532
02:24:53.491 --> 02:24:54.630
<v Speaker 2>Mammal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

3533
02:24:54.660 --> 02:24:55.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're pretty incredible.</v>

3534
02:24:56.160 --> 02:24:57.470
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

3535
02:24:57.480 --> 02:24:58.900
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3536
02:24:58.920 --> 02:25:01.000
<v Speaker 2>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3537
02:25:01.380 --> 02:25:03.060
<v Speaker 2>I'd say if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>

3538
02:25:04.190 --> 02:25:05.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're looking at,</v>

3539
02:25:05.660 --> 02:25:10.050
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an accessible trip and I get to ask this</v>

3540
02:25:10.051 --> 02:25:10.890
<v Speaker 2>all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you do?</v>

3541
02:25:10.891 --> 02:25:14.910
<v Speaker 2>Where would you go if you had like two</v>
<v Speaker 2>weeks to take the kids and drive him</v>

3542
02:25:14.911 --> 02:25:18.120
<v Speaker 2>somewhere?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would just point the car towards a</v>

3543
02:25:18.210 --> 02:25:19.560
<v Speaker 2>Utah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Idaho,</v>

3544
02:25:19.920 --> 02:25:21.450
<v Speaker 2>Montana,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wyoming and just,</v>

3545
02:25:21.490 --> 02:25:23.950
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just head up there and then just see</v>

3546
02:25:23.951 --> 02:25:24.940
<v Speaker 2>what you can see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3547
02:25:24.941 --> 02:25:28.690
<v Speaker 2>you've got plenty of opportunity to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a tremendous number of excellent parks</v>

3548
02:25:29.200 --> 02:25:31.450
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>show the kids something different.</v>

3549
02:25:31.680 --> 02:25:34.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just let them understand these fats.</v>

3550
02:25:34.510 --> 02:25:38.670
<v Speaker 2>Vast swaths of land that it just open</v>
<v Speaker 2>wilderness.</v>

3551
02:25:38.710 --> 02:25:40.800
<v Speaker 2>Take the electronics away to give me</v>
<v Speaker 2>your.</v>

3552
02:25:40.810 --> 02:25:41.321
<v Speaker 2>I bet.</v>

<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

3555
02:25:45.100 --> 02:25:46.510
<v Speaker 2>we're starting to get the kids all</v>
<v Speaker 2>start.</v>

3556
02:25:47.050 --> 02:25:50.590
<v Speaker 2>I'll start school tomorrow and they know</v>
<v Speaker 2>as soon as the school year starts,</v>

3557
02:25:50.591 --> 02:25:53.140
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't get as much electronics now.</v>

3558
02:25:54.100 --> 02:25:54.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no more.</v>

3559
02:25:55.060 --> 02:25:56.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless they have homework or something</v>

3560
02:25:56.381 --> 02:25:58.920
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just too easy to find like escape</v>

3561
02:25:58.921 --> 02:26:03.921
<v Speaker 2>in that from life and that life is</v>
<v Speaker 2>critical for young minds and even being</v>

3562
02:26:04.391 --> 02:26:06.700
<v Speaker 2>bored.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was reading something about the power</v>

3563
02:26:06.701 --> 02:26:11.260
<v Speaker 2>of boredom and how important it is for</v>
<v Speaker 2>creativity that is kids today are kids</v>

3564
02:26:11.261 --> 02:26:14.470
<v Speaker 2>that are never bored.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They never have to think of something to</v>

3565
02:26:14.471 --> 02:26:16.660
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can always just look at their phone</v>

3566
02:26:16.661 --> 02:26:20.740
<v Speaker 2>or look at the TV and it never activates</v>
<v Speaker 2>that part of their brain where they're</v>

3567
02:26:20.741 --> 02:26:22.930
<v Speaker 2>searching and thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's really interesting.</v>

3568
02:26:22.931 --> 02:26:23.980
<v Speaker 2>I hadn't thought about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're right.</v>

3569
02:26:23.980 --> 02:26:26.350
<v Speaker 2>Because we tend to plan everything for</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

3570
02:26:26.830 --> 02:26:28.720
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you got to go to your uh,</v>

3571
02:26:28.750 --> 02:26:32.050
<v Speaker 2>whatever your hockey lesson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go to Lacrosse,</v>

3572
02:26:32.080 --> 02:26:34.480
<v Speaker 2>now it's going to be baseball,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now you've got chess club or whatever</v>

3573
02:26:34.481 --> 02:26:36.140
<v Speaker 2>the hell you doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3574
02:26:36.490 --> 02:26:37.120
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

3575
02:26:37.120 --> 02:26:38.680
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's also kind of goes back to that</v>

3576
02:26:38.681 --> 02:26:41.410
<v Speaker 2>idea that we use to manage these things</v>
<v Speaker 2>for ourselves.</v>

3577
02:26:41.450 --> 02:26:44.770
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so kids would go out and they would</v>

3578
02:26:44.771 --> 02:26:47.530
<v Speaker 2>organize their own teams and I worry</v>
<v Speaker 2>about that too.</v>

3579
02:26:47.531 --> 02:26:49.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like a God,</v>

3580
02:26:49.031 --> 02:26:52.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the ability for kids to meet up at</v>

3581
02:26:52.091 --> 02:26:53.440
<v Speaker 2>a playground and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3582
02:26:53.441 --> 02:26:54.161
<v Speaker 2>we're going to end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3583
02:26:54.161 --> 02:26:55.960
<v Speaker 2>maybe it happens and I'm making too much</v>
<v Speaker 2>of this,</v>

3584
02:26:55.961 --> 02:26:59.320
<v Speaker 2>but we can't have that because bobby</v>
<v Speaker 2>keeps getting picked last and it's</v>

3585
02:26:59.321 --> 02:27:01.130
<v Speaker 2>terrible for his self esteem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>

3586
02:27:01.131 --> 02:27:04.300
<v Speaker 2>at Bobby's going to become a software</v>
<v Speaker 2>coder that makes the ai that runs the</v>

3587
02:27:04.301 --> 02:27:05.120
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

3588
02:27:05.120 --> 02:27:06.250
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that's what happens,</v>

3589
02:27:06.260 --> 02:27:07.220
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the chickens get.</v>

3590
02:27:07.420 --> 02:27:10.210
<v Speaker 2>Bobby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bobby gets passed and bobby becomes mark</v>

3591
02:27:10.211 --> 02:27:13.330
<v Speaker 2>Zuckerberg or Elon Musk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just said chicks am my lead to say</v>

3592
02:27:13.331 --> 02:27:15.090
<v Speaker 2>chicks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chicks,</v>

3593
02:27:15.250 --> 02:27:16.051
<v Speaker 2>chicks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just like,</v>

3594
02:27:16.051 --> 02:27:18.020
<v Speaker 2>you can still mock transracial people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3595
02:27:18.430 --> 02:27:21.370
<v Speaker 2>Games all the broads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where it gets tricky.</v>

3596
02:27:21.371 --> 02:27:22.930
<v Speaker 2>All abroad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to want bobby.</v>

3597
02:27:22.931 --> 02:27:24.910
<v Speaker 2>They've coder broads a weird one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

3598
02:27:24.940 --> 02:27:26.620
<v Speaker 2>Because they're not really that broad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3599
02:27:26.650 --> 02:27:30.550
<v Speaker 2>I caught that happen in dames.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not really private dix from the 19</v>

3600
02:27:30.551 --> 02:27:32.920
<v Speaker 2>thirties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I guess what Dane was.</v>

3601
02:27:33.060 --> 02:27:34.450
<v Speaker 2>Dane was I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3602
02:27:34.451 --> 02:27:37.020
<v Speaker 2>I think of the Maltese Falcon or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

3603
02:27:37.300 --> 02:27:38.780
<v Speaker 2>Game a private.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3604
02:27:38.800 --> 02:27:39.091
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

3605
02:27:39.091 --> 02:27:40.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they would say they would say</v>

3606
02:27:40.751 --> 02:27:42.430
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dame know walked in.</v>

3607
02:27:42.550 --> 02:27:45.640
<v Speaker 2>My life changed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but broads is a weird one because it's</v>

3608
02:27:45.670 --> 02:27:48.990
<v Speaker 2>fun to say because it's like a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys.</v>

3609
02:27:48.990 --> 02:27:51.030
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking broad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Broad.</v>

3610
02:27:51.130 --> 02:27:53.950
<v Speaker 2>I love the saying that I feel like I</v>
<v Speaker 2>should be smoking a cigarette.</v>

3611
02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:56.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying bring a cigar for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3612
02:27:56.800 --> 02:27:59.350
<v Speaker 2>Martini.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not a whole lot of things that</v>

3613
02:27:59.351 --> 02:28:01.450
<v Speaker 2>chicks can say about us like that</v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

3614
02:28:01.480 --> 02:28:04.420
<v Speaker 2>Like Bros.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's sorta like how black people never</v>

3615
02:28:04.421 --> 02:28:06.760
<v Speaker 2>had a replacement word for the n word</v>
<v Speaker 2>for white people.</v>

3616
02:28:06.940 --> 02:28:10.300
<v Speaker 2>LIke honky just does not have any</v>
<v Speaker 2>negative impact.</v>

3617
02:28:10.301 --> 02:28:13.630
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like it's a throwback.</v>

3618
02:28:13.810 --> 02:28:16.990
<v Speaker 2>It's a real historical throwback.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Honky doesn't work.</v>

3619
02:28:17.020 --> 02:28:19.600
<v Speaker 2>Remember the last time I heard anybody</v>
<v Speaker 2>she trashed like whatever.</v>

3620
02:28:19.690 --> 02:28:20.570
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3621
02:28:20.860 --> 02:28:25.100
<v Speaker 2>But like broads is a funny derogatory</v>
<v Speaker 2>term for what women don't.</v>

3622
02:28:25.101 --> 02:28:28.400
<v Speaker 2>I guess burrows they have bros douche</v>
<v Speaker 2>bags.</v>

3623
02:28:28.450 --> 02:28:29.211
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's probably,</v>

3624
02:28:29.211 --> 02:28:30.590
<v Speaker 2>that's probably what more more to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>

3625
02:28:30.660 --> 02:28:33.500
<v Speaker 2>Frozen perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>White oriented though bros are always</v>

3626
02:28:33.501 --> 02:28:36.110
<v Speaker 2>white people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He never say a bunch of bros and it's</v>

3627
02:28:36.200 --> 02:28:36.980
<v Speaker 2>black eyes.</v>

3628
02:28:36.980 --> 02:28:39.620
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know what jamie.</v>

3629
02:28:40.320 --> 02:28:41.870
<v Speaker 2>If you're younger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd be a fuck boy.</v>

3630
02:28:42.170 --> 02:28:43.250
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>

3631
02:28:43.700 --> 02:28:45.380
<v Speaker 2>That's called a fuckboy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3632
02:28:45.381 --> 02:28:48.560
<v Speaker 2>But that's a lot of people to like black</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

3633
02:28:48.790 --> 02:28:50.810
<v Speaker 2>Like that's ian edwards has that</v>
<v Speaker 2>hilarious bit.</v>

3634
02:28:50.811 --> 02:28:52.190
<v Speaker 2>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's everywhere.</v>

3635
02:28:52.191 --> 02:28:54.530
<v Speaker 2>It's universal though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's across the board.</v>

3636
02:28:54.590 --> 02:28:56.680
<v Speaker 2>So we can all agree on fuckboy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3637
02:28:57.010 --> 02:28:58.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what that means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

3638
02:28:58.531 --> 02:29:02.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean like a derogatory term.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3639
02:29:02.990 --> 02:29:03.823
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3640
02:29:03.870 --> 02:29:05.120
<v Speaker 2>because I mean in some circles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows?</v>

3641
02:29:05.121 --> 02:29:06.540
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3642
02:29:06.700 --> 02:29:09.370
<v Speaker 2>Bright cougar wants to fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boy.</v>

3643
02:29:10.900 --> 02:29:14.210

<v Speaker 2>I'm sure I'm not getting it right.</v>

3644
02:29:14.350 --> 02:29:16.790
<v Speaker 2>You got it right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if you're in a situation where</v>

02:30:10.521 --> 02:30:12.980
<v Speaker 2>you'd post it in the mail and that's how</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get business done.</v>

3670
02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:13.910
<v Speaker 2>And that's aLert.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

3671
02:30:13.911 --> 02:30:15.410
<v Speaker 2>That's a standard thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You gotta look at that.</v>

3672
02:30:16.380 --> 02:30:18.080
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of frauds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that steno pool.</v>

3673
02:30:18.110 --> 02:30:19.460
<v Speaker 2>If I was one of those [inaudible] I'd be</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3674
02:30:19.520 --> 02:30:21.940
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather be a hooker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gotta take this.</v>

3675
02:30:21.950 --> 02:30:25.640
<v Speaker 2>Some dudes in there though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably not be a steno pool now.</v>

3676
02:30:25.940 --> 02:30:27.260
<v Speaker 2>Maybe just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3677
02:30:27.261 --> 02:30:29.390
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guys there,</v>

3678
02:30:29.430 --> 02:30:31.250
<v Speaker 2>they allowed them to work with women</v>
<v Speaker 2>back then.</v>

3679
02:30:31.430 --> 02:30:33.380
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hold on.</v>

3680
02:30:33.410 --> 02:30:37.190
<v Speaker 2>Steno pools to cubicles and back again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3681
02:30:37.400 --> 02:30:40.940
<v Speaker 2>Fuck all that to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Learned about standup pools.</v>

3682
02:30:40.941 --> 02:30:42.050
<v Speaker 2>I learned about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck boys.</v>

3683
02:30:42.460 --> 02:30:43.940
<v Speaker 2>That's a trap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a half though,</v>

3684
02:30:43.941 --> 02:30:45.650
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine working in a place like that.</v>

3685
02:30:45.651 --> 02:30:46.300
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

3686
02:30:46.300 --> 02:30:49.040
<v Speaker 2>Where are you going from here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the other one was the,</v>

3687
02:30:49.041 --> 02:30:49.821
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3688
02:30:49.821 --> 02:30:52.760
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the telephone command center.</v>

3689
02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:56.330
<v Speaker 2>Can we take that picture up on the upper</v>
<v Speaker 2>top colored picture?</v>

3690
02:30:56.331 --> 02:30:58.520
<v Speaker 2>Look right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The one with the color in it.</v>

3691
02:30:59.830 --> 02:31:02.420
<v Speaker 2>No one with the girl holding up the</v>
<v Speaker 2>sign.</v>

3692
02:31:02.490 --> 02:31:03.690
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at that.</v>

3693
02:31:04.370 --> 02:31:07.700
<v Speaker 2>Swimming in the steno pool by lynn</v>
<v Speaker 2>peril.</v>

3694
02:31:07.910 --> 02:31:12.050
<v Speaker 2>Oh god.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A retro guy to make it in the office.</v>

3695
02:31:12.080 --> 02:31:13.790
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>

3696
02:31:13.791 --> 02:31:16.640
<v Speaker 2>Big of that modern office equipment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're there in the lower left hand</v>

3697
02:31:16.641 --> 02:31:20.250
<v Speaker 2>corner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gives you a sense of the date of that</v>

3698
02:31:20.251 --> 02:31:22.110
<v Speaker 2>book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No more writing with a crayon.</v>

3699
02:31:22.350 --> 02:31:23.370
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nowadays,</v>

3700
02:31:24.570 --> 02:31:27.690
<v Speaker 2>a key office environment is much more</v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous now.</v>

3701
02:31:27.780 --> 02:31:31.500
<v Speaker 2>I think it's much more fraught with</v>
<v Speaker 2>potential for hazards and landmines.</v>

3702
02:31:31.710 --> 02:31:34.110
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That recording device there.</v>

3703
02:31:34.260 --> 02:31:35.730
<v Speaker 2>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me do that thing.</v>

3704
02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:39.150
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he was talking and to transcribe all</v>

3705
02:31:39.151 --> 02:31:39.990
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what was going on?</v>

3706
02:31:40.010 --> 02:31:43.140
<v Speaker 2>Like a dictaphone?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is with the guy with a bowler hat?</v>

3707
02:31:43.200 --> 02:31:46.380
<v Speaker 2>This is a movie which was like a spy or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

3708
02:31:46.381 --> 02:31:48.110
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

3709
02:31:48.300 --> 02:31:50.070
<v Speaker 2>Because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we used to wear a dress like that.</v>

3710
02:31:50.280 --> 02:31:51.810
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can zoom in on that,</v>

3711
02:31:51.811 --> 02:31:54.210
<v Speaker 2>but that was actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We would get that after we completed</v>

3712
02:31:54.211 --> 02:31:56.220
<v Speaker 2>training,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would actually give us an outfit</v>

3713
02:31:56.221 --> 02:31:57.950
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the entire weight,</v>

3714
02:31:58.500 --> 02:32:00.390
<v Speaker 2>the bowler hat and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's nice.</v>

3715
02:32:00.570 --> 02:32:02.880
<v Speaker 2>And then we would set off on our</v>
<v Speaker 2>adventures lakes.</v>

3716
02:32:02.881 --> 02:32:04.980
<v Speaker 2>What's that new movie?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The kingsmen.</v>

3717
02:32:05.040 --> 02:32:07.980
<v Speaker 2>So what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of spies out there kicking ass.</v>

3718
02:32:08.060 --> 02:32:10.170
<v Speaker 2>I have not seen that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Teaching you deadly skills.</v>

3719
02:32:10.171 --> 02:32:13.620
<v Speaker 2>Like how to kill people at upenn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would teach you life skills.</v>

3720
02:32:13.621 --> 02:32:18.530
<v Speaker 2>Like how to use regular</v>
<v Speaker 2>field expediency.</v>

3721
02:32:18.531 --> 02:32:21.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like knowing how to fire for</v>

3722
02:32:21.360 --> 02:32:22.920
<v Speaker 2>whatever weapon you pick up off the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ground.</v>

3723
02:32:22.980 --> 02:32:25.620
<v Speaker 2>It's just simply knowing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

3724
02:32:26.320 --> 02:32:29.070
<v Speaker 2>what would work and most of it's common</v>
<v Speaker 2>sense,</v>

3725
02:32:29.100 --> 02:32:31.140
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean in terms of what would actually</v>

3726
02:32:31.830 --> 02:32:35.100
<v Speaker 2>do the job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

3727
02:32:35.130 --> 02:32:36.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

3728
02:32:36.190 --> 02:32:38.970
<v Speaker 2>it's just a field expediency,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is good.</v>

<v Speaker 2>position.</v>

3747
02:33:19.081 --> 02:33:21.750
<v Speaker 2>You want to go with things like that and</v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody who doesn't understand that well</v>

3748
02:33:21.810 --> 02:33:23.250
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad you're not in that position.</v>

3749
02:33:23.251 --> 02:33:23.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because.</v>

3750
02:33:23.670 --> 02:33:25.800
<v Speaker 2>And that goes back to Afghanistan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were talking about what's the end</v>

3751
02:33:25.801 --> 02:33:27.360
<v Speaker 2>game if you're going to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't let it,</v>

3752
02:33:27.950 --> 02:33:28.980
<v Speaker 2>let's not draw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3753
02:33:28.981 --> 02:33:32.160
<v Speaker 2>it kind of lets not do this thing where</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're dying by paper cuts or whatever</v>

3754
02:33:32.161 --> 02:33:32.994
<v Speaker 2>you wanna call it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I just.</v>

3755
02:33:33.420 --> 02:33:35.970
<v Speaker 2>And that's kind of where it's been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just feel like we've been in a Holding</v>

3756
02:33:35.971 --> 02:33:40.890
<v Speaker 2>pattern for years now when it comes to</v>
<v Speaker 2>Afghanistan without really knowing where</v>

3757
02:33:40.891 --> 02:33:44.670
<v Speaker 2>we're going or where we want to be when</v>
<v Speaker 2>we get to the end of that road.</v>

3758
02:33:44.740 --> 02:33:47.730
<v Speaker 2>And you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if somebody like madison and people</v>

3759
02:33:47.731 --> 02:33:50.310
<v Speaker 2>in general in the military,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand if you're going to do</v>

3760
02:33:50.311 --> 02:33:51.510
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do it to win,</v>

3761
02:33:51.511 --> 02:33:53.460
<v Speaker 2>that's your objective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I worry that,</v>

3762
02:33:53.490 --> 02:33:58.490
<v Speaker 2>well maybe 40,000 troops is not exactly</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it to when it's doing what they</v>

3763
02:33:59.161 --> 02:34:02.850
<v Speaker 2>feel they can get away with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know where that gets us.</v>

3764
02:34:02.851 --> 02:34:06.630
<v Speaker 2>At the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this whole tRump thing is getting</v>

3765
02:34:06.631 --> 02:34:09.990
<v Speaker 2>weirder and weirder with every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to even predict where we could be six</v>

3766
02:34:09.991 --> 02:34:12.660
<v Speaker 2>months from now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>forget about four years from now or</v>

3767
02:34:12.661 --> 02:34:16.050
<v Speaker 2>three and a half years from now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that when you look at some of</v>

3768
02:34:16.051 --> 02:34:18.280
<v Speaker 2>the stuff that he does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you really have to wonder</v>

3769
02:34:18.280 --> 02:34:21.430
<v Speaker 4>about his mental health and I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't say that like,</v>

3770
02:34:21.810 --> 02:34:23.440
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of people that are saying</v>

3771
02:34:23.470 --> 02:34:26.350
<v Speaker 4>that I think because,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they would like to think that</v>

3772
02:34:26.351 --> 02:34:29.290
<v Speaker 4>he's mentally incompetent and it became</v>
<v Speaker 4>convenIent for their argument.</v>

3773
02:34:29.560 --> 02:34:31.510
<v Speaker 4>But when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I read that,</v>

3774
02:34:31.840 --> 02:34:36.840
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what agency it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was trying to get the ip addresses of</v>

3775
02:34:37.661 --> 02:34:40.450
<v Speaker 4>people that visited an anti trump</v>
<v Speaker 4>website.</v>

3776
02:34:41.070 --> 02:34:43.390
<v Speaker 4>Did you hear about that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like sessions is working on.</v>

3777
02:34:43.540 --> 02:34:45.250
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's insane.</v>

3778
02:34:45.670 --> 02:34:47.800
<v Speaker 4>Because I could have visited that site</v>
<v Speaker 4>if somebody sent me a link.</v>

3779
02:34:47.801 --> 02:34:49.550
<v Speaker 4>You got to see this crazy anti-trump</v>
<v Speaker 4>site.</v>

3780
02:34:50.050 --> 02:34:52.540
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't mean I'm a part of that</v>
<v Speaker 4>community or anything like that.</v>

3781
02:34:52.690 --> 02:34:56.230
<v Speaker 4>You can't get ip addresses for him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Someone who visits things online either</v>

3782
02:34:56.231 --> 02:34:56.640
<v Speaker 4>side.</v>

3783
02:34:56.640 --> 02:34:58.890
<v Speaker 2>Anytime it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care which administration it is.</v>

3784
02:34:58.891 --> 02:34:59.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can argue.</v>

3785
02:35:01.110 --> 02:35:01.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3786
02:35:01.620 --> 02:35:04.680
<v Speaker 2>it's just the potential for abuse of</v>
<v Speaker 2>power.</v>

3787
02:35:04.681 --> 02:35:07.560
<v Speaker 2>I've always agreed with that idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a small government person,</v>

3788
02:35:07.561 --> 02:35:12.561
<v Speaker 2>so the potential for abuse of power is</v>
<v Speaker 2>always there and needs to be monitored.</v>

3789
02:35:13.690 --> 02:35:15.160
<v Speaker 4>Potential catastrophic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3790
02:35:15.180 --> 02:35:18.040
<v Speaker 4>because as soon as people lose</v>
<v Speaker 4>confidence and that's one of the biggest</v>

3791
02:35:18.041 --> 02:35:21.370
<v Speaker 4>issues with trump as a president,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if people lose confidence in the</v>

3792
02:35:21.371 --> 02:35:24.040
<v Speaker 4>institution,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like one of the things that was very</v>

3793
02:35:24.041 --> 02:35:28.000
<v Speaker 4>disturbing to a lot of people was that</v>
<v Speaker 4>when he had those russians over and he</v>

3794
02:35:28.001 --> 02:35:32.740
<v Speaker 4>was explaining how isis is thinking</v>
<v Speaker 4>about using laptops as bombs and they're</v>

3795
02:35:32.741 --> 02:35:33.790
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>jesus fucking christ,</v>

3796
02:35:33.791 --> 02:35:36.760
<v Speaker 4>this is top secret shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're noT supposed to say that because</v>

3797
02:35:36.761 --> 02:35:41.761
<v Speaker 4>then this could potentially compromise</v>
<v Speaker 4>people that are embedded in isis that</v>

3798
02:35:42.071 --> 02:35:45.380
<v Speaker 4>are distributing this information.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you have a bunch of people that</v>

3799
02:35:45.390 --> 02:35:48.310
<v Speaker 4>you're giving up this information.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a trickle down effect and it</v>

3800
02:35:48.311 --> 02:35:53.311
<v Speaker 4>also diminishes the potential for people</v>
<v Speaker 4>to trust the office person running all</v>

3801
02:35:55.140 --> 02:35:55.980
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see that?</v>

3802
02:35:55.981 --> 02:35:58.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean the previous administration had</v>
<v Speaker 2>problems where they sort of in their</v>

3803
02:35:58.921 --> 02:36:03.540
<v Speaker 2>desire to rush to the podium to declare</v>
<v Speaker 2>a victory and something.</v>

3804
02:36:03.690 --> 02:36:08.690
<v Speaker 2>There was</v>
<v Speaker 2>a disregard for sources and methods of</v>

3805
02:36:08.971 --> 02:36:11.490
<v Speaker 2>disregard for the importance of</v>
<v Speaker 2>occasionally,</v>

3806
02:36:11.520 --> 02:36:14.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>secrets are good on,</v>

3807
02:36:14.100 --> 02:36:14.461
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

3808
02:36:14.461 --> 02:36:17.280
<v Speaker 2>in many cases when it comes to intel</v>
<v Speaker 2>operations,</v>

3809
02:36:17.281 --> 02:36:18.870
<v Speaker 2>you want again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want checks and Balances.</v>

3810
02:36:18.871 --> 02:36:20.250
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I completely get that.</v>

3811
02:36:20.280 --> 02:36:22.200
<v Speaker 2>And of course people are losing their</v>
<v Speaker 2>mindset going,</v>

3812
02:36:22.201 --> 02:36:25.260
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe it's cia guy talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about checks and balances because,</v>

3813
02:36:25.290 --> 02:36:26.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure he doesn't believe it,</v>

3814
02:36:26.790 --> 02:36:30.480
<v Speaker 2>but it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The place you know for that is in the</v>

3815
02:36:31.170 --> 02:36:35.040
<v Speaker 2>committees and up on capital hill where</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're supposed to have an engaged,</v>

3816
02:36:35.340 --> 02:36:38.220
<v Speaker 2>aggressively curious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>inquisitive.</v>

3817
02:36:38.600 --> 02:36:43.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm operation up there between the</v>
<v Speaker 2>various committees that are supposed are</v>

3818
02:36:43.111 --> 02:36:45.230
<v Speaker 2>charged with overseeing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3819
02:36:45.320 --> 02:36:46.830
<v Speaker 2>the work of the intel community.</v>

3820
02:36:47.270 --> 02:36:49.740
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and oftentimes they do know exactly</v>

3821
02:36:49.741 --> 02:36:51.780
<v Speaker 2>what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just play this game where they</v>

3822
02:36:51.980 --> 02:36:54.450
<v Speaker 2>disavow any knowledge when it looks like</v>
<v Speaker 2>this political blow back.</v>

3823
02:36:54.870 --> 02:36:58.980
<v Speaker 2>there's a fairly well worn path between</v>
<v Speaker 2>langley as an example in capitol hill</v>

3824
02:36:59.340 --> 02:37:01.800
<v Speaker 2>for the briefings telling people this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on,</v>

3825
02:37:01.801 --> 02:37:03.120
<v Speaker 2>this is what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

3826
02:37:03.630 --> 02:37:06.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the general unwritten understanding is,</v>

3827
02:37:06.440 --> 02:37:07.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to be assholes.</v>

3828
02:37:07.531 --> 02:37:10.800
<v Speaker 2>If it becomes politically expedient to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do so,</v>

3829
02:37:10.801 --> 02:37:13.680
<v Speaker 2>they'll disavow that they knew about it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they'll demand in,</v>

3830
02:37:13.860 --> 02:37:16.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's just so a game that gets played</v>

3831
02:37:16.011 --> 02:37:17.690
<v Speaker 2>sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

3832
02:37:18.560 --> 02:37:19.550
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

3833
02:37:20.030 --> 02:37:22.170
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that it's,</v>

3834
02:37:22.260 --> 02:37:23.300
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to say I've got,</v>

3835
02:37:23.330 --> 02:37:28.330
<v Speaker 2>I've got friends who are very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a hard left and they're convinced that,</v>

3836
02:37:28.970 --> 02:37:32.000
<v Speaker 2>that trump's on his way out in the not</v>
<v Speaker 2>too distant future.</v>

3837
02:37:33.050 --> 02:37:34.490
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a lot of wishful</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking,</v>

3838
02:37:34.910 --> 02:37:36.590
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think he's gonna make it for</v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

3839
02:37:36.650 --> 02:37:39.140
<v Speaker 2>I might be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just doesn't seem like it.</v>

3840
02:37:39.260 --> 02:37:41.900
<v Speaker 2>I think he's also incredibly resilient</v>
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>

3841
02:37:42.210 --> 02:37:44.600
<v Speaker 2>because he is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's unusual in that regard.</v>

3842
02:37:44.690 --> 02:37:49.690
<v Speaker 2>He's also a guy though that wants love</v>
<v Speaker 2>and respect and wants to be a winner.</v>

3843
02:37:50.150 --> 02:37:55.150
<v Speaker 2>Like everything he does it in regards to</v>
<v Speaker 2>business decisions mean he,</v>

3844
02:37:56.690 --> 02:38:00.020
<v Speaker 2>he'll take something personally himself</v>
<v Speaker 2>to declare a victory.</v>

3845
02:38:00.260 --> 02:38:03.830
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you got to wonder whether or not we</v>

3846
02:38:03.831 --> 02:38:05.690
<v Speaker 2>would put someone in position,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3847
02:38:05.990 --> 02:38:08.330
<v Speaker 2>to say like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fake news is so out to get him to.</v>

3848
02:38:08.331 --> 02:38:11.840
<v Speaker 2>What we've done is we've created a</v>
<v Speaker 2>structure that's the best people for the</v>

3849
02:38:11.841 --> 02:38:13.880
<v Speaker 2>job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I'm going to concentrate on</v>

3850
02:38:13.881 --> 02:38:15.710
<v Speaker 2>business and helping them from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>outside.</v>

3851
02:38:15.790 --> 02:38:19.520
<v Speaker 2>you could escape and have some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>escape route.</v>

3852
02:38:19.790 --> 02:38:21.170
<v Speaker 2>There's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

3853
02:38:21.580 --> 02:38:25.850
<v Speaker 2>it sometimes seems as if there's no</v>
<v Speaker 2>grownups in charge of the messaging that</v>

3854
02:38:25.851 --> 02:38:26.780
<v Speaker 2>comes out of the white house.</v>

3855
02:38:26.780 --> 02:38:28.490
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's Been the case since day one</v>

3856
02:38:28.491 --> 02:38:29.690
<v Speaker 2>basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And part of it is,</v>

3857
02:38:30.440 --> 02:38:31.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe people say,</v>

3858
02:38:31.761 --> 02:38:32.860
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the way he likes to play.</v>

3859
02:38:32.880 --> 02:38:35.300
<v Speaker 2>He likes to play people off of each</v>
<v Speaker 2>other anD he likes the chaos.</v>

3860
02:38:35.301 --> 02:38:36.470
<v Speaker 2>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3861
02:38:36.471 --> 02:38:38.390
<v Speaker 2>you know why he never ran a big</v>
<v Speaker 2>organization.</v>

3862
02:38:38.391 --> 02:38:40.220
<v Speaker 2>People imagined or thought if they</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't,</v>

3863
02:38:40.240 --> 02:38:40.840
<v Speaker 2>if they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3864
02:38:40.840 --> 02:38:44.150
<v Speaker 2>if you didn't spend any time up in New</v>
<v Speaker 2>York and having watched the trump</v>

3865
02:38:44.300 --> 02:38:46.160
<v Speaker 2>organization for years and years and</v>
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>

3866
02:38:46.161 --> 02:38:49.250
<v Speaker 2>if he hadn't done that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you imagine it to be this massive</v>

3867
02:38:49.251 --> 02:38:50.660
<v Speaker 2>organization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it's not,</v>

3868
02:38:50.720 --> 02:38:53.060
<v Speaker 2>it's always been kind of a family</v>
<v Speaker 2>business.</v>

3869
02:38:53.061 --> 02:38:56.150
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's just so the chaos that's</v>

3870
02:38:56.151 --> 02:38:58.580
<v Speaker 2>around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that shouldn't be a surprise.</v>

3871
02:38:58.581 --> 02:39:00.950
<v Speaker 2>What is a surprise is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3872
02:39:00.951 --> 02:39:04.670
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't sharp enough for what I know</v>

3873
02:39:04.671 --> 02:39:06.920
<v Speaker 2>what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They tend to understand the importance</v>

3874
02:39:06.921 --> 02:39:10.820
<v Speaker 2>of inserting the discipline in there and</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least if nothing else,</v>

3875
02:39:10.821 --> 02:39:14.750
<v Speaker 2>being consistent and disciplined with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the messaging that comes out and just</v>

3876
02:39:14.900 --> 02:39:16.460
<v Speaker 2>quit the fucking tweeting.</v>

3877
02:39:19.070 --> 02:39:19.611
<v Speaker 2>People say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3878
02:39:19.611 --> 02:39:22.220
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what makes him him for people.</v>

3879
02:39:22.221 --> 02:39:25.400
<v Speaker 2>It's an entertainment that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3880
02:39:26.140 --> 02:39:28.970
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a portal for fun,</v>

3881
02:39:29.370 --> 02:39:30.650
<v Speaker 2>like fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3882
02:39:30.651 --> 02:39:33.620
<v Speaker 2>that's what you're getting out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You like seeing the stupid shitty rights</v>

3883
02:39:33.621 --> 02:39:34.700
<v Speaker 2>and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my god.</v>

3884
02:39:35.060 --> 02:39:36.950
<v Speaker 2>And you correlate some of the time so</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he writes it.</v>

3885
02:39:37.030 --> 02:39:39.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's 2:00 in the morning.</v>

3886
02:39:39.141 --> 02:39:40.360
<v Speaker 2>Is that interesting?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want,</v>

3887
02:39:40.580 --> 02:39:43.040
<v Speaker 2>but that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3888
02:39:43.070 --> 02:39:43.910
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

3889
02:39:43.911 --> 02:39:44.890
<v Speaker 2>I understand people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3890
02:39:44.930 --> 02:39:48.200
<v Speaker 2>people are excited to have a genuine</v>
<v Speaker 2>person who's not a politician in there</v>

3891
02:39:48.201 --> 02:39:50.360
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some benefit to shake the system</v>

3892
02:39:50.361 --> 02:39:53.690
<v Speaker 2>up for sure and need some shaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

3893
02:39:53.691 --> 02:39:55.880
<v Speaker 2>how much shaking is actually been done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want that.</v>

3894
02:39:55.910 --> 02:39:56.511
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3895
02:39:56.511 --> 02:39:59.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather the president not spend as</v>

3896
02:39:59.301 --> 02:40:03.720
<v Speaker 2>much time watching tv or a tweeting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3897
02:40:03.950 --> 02:40:08.950
<v Speaker 2>and working to try to accomplish</v>
<v Speaker 2>something major in the way of tax reform</v>

3898
02:40:09.740 --> 02:40:11.560
<v Speaker 2>or even the healthcare problem couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>lord,</v>

3899
02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:13.100
<v Speaker 2>we're not even to get that done.</v>

3900
02:40:13.440 --> 02:40:18.440
<v Speaker 2>I think there's also a real problem from</v>
<v Speaker 2>the top down when the commander in chief</v>

3901
02:40:19.240 --> 02:40:22.710
<v Speaker 2>likes to personally insult people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think when you do that,</v>

3902
02:40:22.711 --> 02:40:25.680
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you make that kind of behavior not just</v>

3903
02:40:25.681 --> 02:40:28.390
<v Speaker 2>acceptable but standard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3904
02:40:28.650 --> 02:40:29.161
<v Speaker 2>well it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3905
02:40:29.161 --> 02:40:31.380
<v Speaker 2>with your kids and kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3906
02:40:31.381 --> 02:40:36.270
<v Speaker 2>if they were probably more to the point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like people we talked about the</v>

3907
02:40:36.271 --> 02:40:37.560
<v Speaker 2>fact that nobody can keep their yap</v>
<v Speaker 2>shot,</v>

3908
02:40:37.561 --> 02:40:39.420
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So secrets get out there right now and</v>

3909
02:40:39.421 --> 02:40:43.710
<v Speaker 2>that's because we've created this</v>
<v Speaker 2>environment.</v>

3910
02:40:43.860 --> 02:40:46.140
<v Speaker 2>If it's okay for a former defense</v>
<v Speaker 2>secretary,</v>

3911
02:40:46.141 --> 02:40:49.140
<v Speaker 2>a former head of the cia or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they get out to write a book,</v>

3912
02:40:49.200 --> 02:40:51.450
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're getting paid millions of</v>

3913
02:40:51.450 --> 02:40:52.410
<v Speaker 2>dollars to write that book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

3914
02:40:52.411 --> 02:40:54.120
<v Speaker 2>they got to cough up something</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>

3915
02:40:55.170 --> 02:40:57.750
<v Speaker 2>IF they do that over a period of time</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they've been doing that,</v>

3916
02:40:57.751 --> 02:40:59.490
<v Speaker 2>then people down below think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3917
02:40:59.491 --> 02:41:03.180
<v Speaker 2>why the fuck yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all sign the same agreements to keep her</v>

3918
02:41:03.181 --> 02:41:05.100
<v Speaker 2>yap shut,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maybe it's okay.</v>

3919
02:41:05.520 --> 02:41:07.470
<v Speaker 2>So it starts at the top.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

3920
02:41:07.471 --> 02:41:09.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's just like with parenting,</v>

3921
02:41:09.751 --> 02:41:12.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they got to see you do the things</v>

3922
02:41:12.061 --> 02:41:14.700
<v Speaker 2>that you tell them to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise kids are sharp enough to</v>

3923
02:41:14.701 --> 02:41:16.170
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you're not doing it right.</v>

3924
02:41:16.710 --> 02:41:18.600
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think it's,</v>

3925
02:41:19.900 --> 02:41:21.180
<v Speaker 2>I don't know where I was going with</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

3926
02:41:21.181 --> 02:41:24.540
<v Speaker 2>I tend to get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tend to get down the rabbit hole and</v>

3927
02:41:24.541 --> 02:41:27.030
<v Speaker 2>distracted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a distracting subject because</v>

3928
02:41:27.031 --> 02:41:29.670
<v Speaker 2>it's really difficult to see how do we</v>
<v Speaker 2>get out of this?</v>

3929
02:41:29.930 --> 02:41:30.640
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well okay,</v>

3930
02:41:30.640 --> 02:41:32.550
<v Speaker 2>we've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've obviously got this guy who's</v>

3931
02:41:32.551 --> 02:41:34.800
<v Speaker 2>running the country is doing a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that people don't enjoy.</v>

3932
02:41:35.130 --> 02:41:37.460
<v Speaker 2>They don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They see a lot of problems in it and</v>

3933
02:41:37.461 --> 02:41:40.350
<v Speaker 2>they don't see a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a real light at the end of the tunnel.</v>

3934
02:41:40.620 --> 02:41:43.740
<v Speaker 2>It's like what's the best case scenario?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this guy going to get us in a fucking</v>

3935
02:41:43.741 --> 02:41:45.150
<v Speaker 2>war with North Korea?</v>

3936
02:41:45.150 --> 02:41:46.620
<v Speaker 2>So we realized like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3937
02:41:46.621 --> 02:41:48.930
<v Speaker 2>North Korea and us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know we're going to war now.</v>

3938
02:41:48.960 --> 02:41:50.700
<v Speaker 2>This could have been avoided.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got to get rid of them.</v>

3939
02:41:51.050 --> 02:41:53.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the worst case scenario that has</v>

3940
02:41:53.671 --> 02:41:58.671
<v Speaker 2>to happen where we can survive as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>country but still just recover from</v>

3941
02:42:00.061 --> 02:42:02.970
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The North Korea thing is,</v>

3942
02:42:02.971 --> 02:42:06.900
<v Speaker 2>is uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is kind of frustrating in a sense,</v>

3943
02:42:06.901 --> 02:42:09.390
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because nobody should be out there</v>

3944
02:42:09.391 --> 02:42:11.220
<v Speaker 2>thinking that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm sure you know,</v>

3945
02:42:11.250 --> 02:42:16.250
<v Speaker 2>very few do that somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got to that point with North Korea</v>

3946
02:42:16.740 --> 02:42:19.250
<v Speaker 2>because president trump is president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3947
02:42:19.620 --> 02:42:22.800
<v Speaker 2>We got to this point when North Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we kicked the can down the road</v>

3948
02:42:22.801 --> 02:42:27.801
<v Speaker 2>for two and a half decades of failed</v>
<v Speaker 2>foreign policy with North Korea and in</v>

3949
02:42:28.861 --> 02:42:32.250
<v Speaker 2>part with China.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they've been very clear about</v>

3950
02:42:32.251 --> 02:42:35.790
<v Speaker 2>what they wanted to do and now they've</v>
<v Speaker 2>gotten to that point where they've</v>

3951
02:42:35.791 --> 02:42:39.180
<v Speaker 2>created the weapons program and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ballistic missile program that they want</v>

3952
02:42:39.240 --> 02:42:40.980
<v Speaker 2>or that they are close to having.</v>

3953
02:42:41.460 --> 02:42:44.310
<v Speaker 2>And you knoW,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you get to that point,</v>

3954
02:42:44.370 --> 02:42:47.310
<v Speaker 2>you naturally lose some of your options,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3955
02:42:47.311 --> 02:42:51.000
<v Speaker 2>so the decision tree gets smaller and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3956
02:42:51.001 --> 02:42:55.590
<v Speaker 2>trump happens to be the president in</v>
<v Speaker 2>office now when North Korea reaches that</v>

3957
02:42:55.591 --> 02:42:58.770
<v Speaker 2>stage and North Korea is pretty</v>
<v Speaker 2>consistent in the way that they've been</v>

3958
02:42:58.771 --> 02:42:59.790
<v Speaker 2>behaving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3959
02:42:59.791 --> 02:43:02.970
<v Speaker 2>they're always doing the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They throw their teddy out of the cot</v>

3960
02:43:02.971 --> 02:43:05.670
<v Speaker 2>when they get upset and they want some</v>
<v Speaker 2>attention where they feel they can get</v>

3961
02:43:05.671 --> 02:43:09.120
<v Speaker 2>something out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Typically they do get something or China</v>

3962
02:43:09.150 --> 02:43:12.010
<v Speaker 2>get something that then they're willing</v>
<v Speaker 2>to reign them in</v>

3963
02:43:12.010 --> 02:43:13.410
<v Speaker 3>to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3964
02:43:14.420 --> 02:43:15.540
<v Speaker 3>in just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3965
02:43:15.610 --> 02:43:19.330
<v Speaker 3>trump could well Be the guy sitting in</v>
<v Speaker 3>an office where Iran gets to that point</v>

3966
02:43:19.360 --> 02:43:22.930
<v Speaker 3>because anybody who thinks Iran is not</v>
<v Speaker 3>spinning the centrifuges and continuing</v>

3967
02:43:22.931 --> 02:43:25.150
<v Speaker 3>to work on their weapons capabilities</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

3968
02:43:25.210 --> 02:43:27.430
<v Speaker 3>is somewhat insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that,</v>

3969
02:43:28.180 --> 02:43:30.860
<v Speaker 3>there is no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3970
02:43:31.240 --> 02:43:34.480
<v Speaker 3>john kerry said the whole Iran deal was</v>
<v Speaker 3>based on verification,</v>

3971
02:43:34.790 --> 02:43:35.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

3972
02:43:35.590 --> 02:43:38.470
<v Speaker 3>And we don't have verification.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't have,</v>

3973
02:43:38.471 --> 02:43:40.270
<v Speaker 3>we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we haven't gotten access still to some</v>

3974
02:43:40.271 --> 02:43:44.830
<v Speaker 3>facilities that we would need to see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We signed off with the previous</v>

3975
02:43:44.831 --> 02:43:46.270
<v Speaker 3>administration,</v>
<v Speaker 3>signed off on a,</v>

3976
02:43:46.990 --> 02:43:50.680
<v Speaker 3>on a study or a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an assessment basically just to get the</v>

3977
02:43:50.681 --> 02:43:54.730
<v Speaker 3>deal done because the iranians insisted</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that investigation into their</v>

3978
02:43:54.731 --> 02:43:58.810
<v Speaker 3>capabilities at one of their military</v>
<v Speaker 3>sites come to a close.</v>

3979
02:43:59.180 --> 02:44:02.590
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't like we suddenly got answers</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we were satisfied tHat there was no.</v>

3980
02:44:02.630 --> 02:44:03.490
<v Speaker 3>And we just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3981
02:44:03.491 --> 02:44:06.880
<v Speaker 3>that was part of the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we'll end that investigation,</v>

3982
02:44:06.881 --> 02:44:09.910
<v Speaker 3>but we don't have that verification.</v>
<v Speaker 3>so trump could do my point being trump</v>

3983
02:44:09.911 --> 02:44:12.890
<v Speaker 3>could just be sitting in that seat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3984
02:44:12.910 --> 02:44:16.300
<v Speaker 3>when North Korea gets where they are</v>
<v Speaker 3>when Iran possibly,</v>

3985
02:44:16.360 --> 02:44:17.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because that could happen sooner rather</v>

3986
02:44:17.741 --> 02:44:19.030
<v Speaker 3>than later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

3987
02:44:19.031 --> 02:44:20.770
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you'd like to think that the person</v>

3988
02:44:20.771 --> 02:44:24.670
<v Speaker 3>in that position will be rational.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3989
02:44:24.770 --> 02:44:25.660
<v Speaker 3>Little more reasoned.</v>

3990
02:44:25.840 --> 02:44:27.640
<v Speaker 4>I read an article today that is saying</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

3991
02:44:27.810 --> 02:44:32.350
<v Speaker 4>that him saying all that crazy shit</v>
<v Speaker 4>about fire and fury at the world has</v>

3992
02:44:32.351 --> 02:44:35.560
<v Speaker 4>ever seen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>might've actually Been what he needed to</v>

3993
02:44:35.561 --> 02:44:37.900
<v Speaker 4>say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you're dealing with someone like</v>

3994
02:44:37.901 --> 02:44:39.020
<v Speaker 4>North Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I mean,</v>

3995
02:44:39.021 --> 02:44:43.570
<v Speaker 4>it was obviously an opinion piece,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the argument was that when you're</v>

3996
02:44:43.571 --> 02:44:46.900
<v Speaker 4>dealing with someone does as fucked up</v>
<v Speaker 4>as kim jong,</v>

3997
02:44:47.290 --> 02:44:51.640
<v Speaker 4>you're probably better off having</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone as crazy as trump as president</v>

3998
02:44:51.641 --> 02:44:54.400
<v Speaker 4>who's going to say some ridiculous shit</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>

3999
02:44:54.401 --> 02:44:55.390
<v Speaker 4>So this guy goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

4000
02:44:55.510 --> 02:44:56.980
<v Speaker 4>this guy's just as nuts as me.</v>

4001
02:44:57.780 --> 02:44:59.660
<v Speaker 3>Does that mean that there could be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And frankly,</v>

4002
02:44:59.661 --> 02:45:02.420
<v Speaker 3>those messages that he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he does his things that he said were</v>

4003
02:45:02.421 --> 02:45:04.670
<v Speaker 3>probably more important in terms of how</v>
<v Speaker 3>China received them.</v>

4004
02:45:04.910 --> 02:45:08.720
<v Speaker 3>Then how North Korea received them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and honestly,</v>

4005
02:45:09.100 --> 02:45:13.520
<v Speaker 3>20 plus years of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of measure diplomatic language and</v>

4006
02:45:14.870 --> 02:45:18.080
<v Speaker 3>restrained talk didn't really do</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>

4007
02:45:18.110 --> 02:45:21.680
<v Speaker 3>It just kicked the can down the road.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

4008
02:45:21.710 --> 02:45:25.040
<v Speaker 3>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe a different approach in a measured</v>

4009
02:45:25.041 --> 02:45:27.740
<v Speaker 3>fashion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the problem is because of their sort</v>

4010
02:45:27.741 --> 02:45:31.190
<v Speaker 3>of the perceived chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody has the confidence to believe</v>

4011
02:45:31.191 --> 02:45:34.340
<v Speaker 3>that he's doing it in a disciplined,</v>
<v Speaker 3>reasoned way.</v>

4012
02:45:34.640 --> 02:45:35.690
<v Speaker 3>So they don't look at it and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

4013
02:45:35.691 --> 02:45:37.830
<v Speaker 3>he's saying that's a message he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>sending it.</v>

4014
02:45:37.840 --> 02:45:40.730
<v Speaker 3>Just looked at it and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just go blasting off another tweet</v>

4015
02:45:40.830 --> 02:45:41.840
<v Speaker 3>up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Scott Adams.</v>

4016
02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:44.520
<v Speaker 4>Scott adams is the only one that</v>
<v Speaker 4>believes this is some large,</v>

4017
02:45:44.521 --> 02:45:47.520
<v Speaker 4>clever masterplan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We mIss scott as a dilbert.</v>

4018
02:45:47.550 --> 02:45:48.383
<v Speaker 4>dilbert.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4019
02:45:48.490 --> 02:45:50.450
<v Speaker 4>I know about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Scott adams,</v>

4020
02:45:50.460 --> 02:45:53.010
<v Speaker 4>like the most rational,</v>
<v Speaker 4>logical,</v>

4021
02:45:53.011 --> 02:45:56.470
<v Speaker 4>intelligent trump supporter that's ever</v>
<v Speaker 4>lived and he's not really a trump</v>

4022
02:45:56.471 --> 02:45:56.860
<v Speaker 4>support.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Support.</v>

4023
02:45:56.860 --> 02:45:59.010
<v Speaker 4>Didn't vote for trump because he talks</v>
<v Speaker 4>about these things.</v>

4024
02:45:59.011 --> 02:46:01.650
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't want to vote for president</v>
<v Speaker 4>because he doesn't want to have a stake</v>

4025
02:46:01.651 --> 02:46:03.960
<v Speaker 4>in the game,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he believes that trump is a master</v>

4026
02:46:03.961 --> 02:46:07.920
<v Speaker 4>persuader and that everything he's doing</v>
<v Speaker 4>is because of the art of persuasion.</v>

4027
02:46:08.190 --> 02:46:09.580
<v Speaker 4>It's very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Interesting.</v>

4028
02:46:09.600 --> 02:46:10.080
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4029
02:46:10.080 --> 02:46:13.570
<v Speaker 2>I'd falls apart under scrutiny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kind of fell apart with his art.</v>

4030
02:46:13.760 --> 02:46:16.940
<v Speaker 2>These,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these arguments with a podcast with sam</v>

4031
02:46:16.941 --> 02:46:18.910
<v Speaker 2>harris is pretty fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4032
02:46:19.340 --> 02:46:19.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

4033
02:46:19.850 --> 02:46:21.610
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can see where people.</v>

4034
02:46:21.730 --> 02:46:26.180
<v Speaker 2>I've heard that from trump supporters</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they talk about how he's.</v>

4035
02:46:26.420 --> 02:46:28.970
<v Speaker 2>Everything's measured.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything in his own way.</v>

4036
02:46:28.971 --> 02:46:31.550
<v Speaker 2>His is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is actually disciplined because I've</v>

4037
02:46:31.551 --> 02:46:34.370
<v Speaker 2>said numerous times that I think they</v>
<v Speaker 2>lacked discipline and they said,</v>

4038
02:46:34.371 --> 02:46:34.611
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

4039
02:46:34.611 --> 02:46:34.881
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

4040
02:46:34.881 --> 02:46:39.881
<v Speaker 2>Actually this is all part of the plan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking it doesn't look like it's</v>

4041
02:46:40.101 --> 02:46:43.310
<v Speaker 2>part of the plan because you've got</v>
<v Speaker 2>other people that are in those senior</v>

4042
02:46:43.311 --> 02:46:46.640
<v Speaker 2>positions that seem to be scrambling to</v>
<v Speaker 2>catch up to the plan.</v>

4043
02:46:46.641 --> 02:46:49.310
<v Speaker 2>And if it was part of the plan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'd like to think it was,</v>

4044
02:46:49.630 --> 02:46:50.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

4045
02:46:50.330 --> 02:46:52.320
<v Speaker 2>it was part of a conversation amongst</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

4046
02:46:52.321 --> 02:46:53.091
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cabinet.</v>

4047
02:46:53.091 --> 02:46:54.830
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4048
02:46:54.910 --> 02:46:55.471
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>

4049
02:46:55.471 --> 02:46:57.080
<v Speaker 2>I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4050
02:46:57.110 --> 02:46:57.943
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we're.</v>

4051
02:46:58.550 --> 02:47:00.590
<v Speaker 2>Missiles aren't going to be flying</v>
<v Speaker 2>between us and North Korea.</v>

4052
02:47:00.591 --> 02:47:03.950
<v Speaker 2>I think China may actually see at this</v>
<v Speaker 2>stage of the game,</v>

4053
02:47:03.980 --> 02:47:08.510
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they may see that they need to,</v>

4054
02:47:08.780 --> 02:47:11.270
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>affect the different mindset for North</v>

4055
02:47:11.270 --> 02:47:13.760
<v Speaker 2>Korea and they may be doing that and</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of it may be,</v>

4056
02:47:13.761 --> 02:47:15.800
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not necessarily because it was a reason</v>

4057
02:47:15.801 --> 02:47:18.500
<v Speaker 2>to thought out plan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but trump's comments about the trade</v>

4058
02:47:18.501 --> 02:47:22.520
<v Speaker 2>imbalance with China.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the chinese legitimately thought that</v>

4059
02:47:22.521 --> 02:47:26.180
<v Speaker 2>we were going to put that under the</v>
<v Speaker 2>microscope and maybe attack them on the</v>

4060
02:47:26.181 --> 02:47:29.510
<v Speaker 2>trade imbalance in a serious way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then maybe they look at that and go,</v>

4061
02:47:29.511 --> 02:47:31.160
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well we can get them to back off.</v>

4062
02:47:31.640 --> 02:47:32.361
<v Speaker 2>Then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

4063
02:47:32.361 --> 02:47:35.820
<v Speaker 2>we're willing to extend ourselves and</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually listened to the sanctions and</v>

4064
02:47:35.840 --> 02:47:40.580
<v Speaker 2>take part in the sanctions and exert</v>
<v Speaker 2>some additional pressure on North Korea</v>

4065
02:47:40.581 --> 02:47:43.340
<v Speaker 2>that maybe they weren't in the past</v>
<v Speaker 2>because China always accidents own best</v>

4066
02:47:43.341 --> 02:47:45.650
<v Speaker 2>interest and so they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're looking for something,</v>

4067
02:47:45.651 --> 02:47:47.000
<v Speaker 2>what are we going to get out of this?</v>

4068
02:47:47.300 --> 02:47:49.460
<v Speaker 2>And maybe so maybe that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4069
02:47:50.240 --> 02:47:51.050
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

4070
02:47:51.050 --> 02:47:53.270
<v Speaker 2>in the meantime it seems to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>resolved itself to some degree,</v>

4071
02:47:53.271 --> 02:47:54.350
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do worry that,</v>

4072
02:47:54.490 --> 02:47:55.311
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once again,</v>

4073
02:47:55.311 --> 02:47:57.290
<v Speaker 2>and we're Just kicking it down the road,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4074
02:47:57.430 --> 02:47:59.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean until there's something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sea change where,</v>

4075
02:48:00.340 --> 02:48:03.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe somehow we can affect a unified,</v>

4076
02:48:03.550 --> 02:48:04.383
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4077
02:48:04.430 --> 02:48:07.640
<v Speaker 2>Korea with china's assistance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to have to be with their</v>

4078
02:48:07.641 --> 02:48:11.450
<v Speaker 2>assistants and blessing obviously a or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something along those lines to get</v>

4079
02:48:11.840 --> 02:48:13.630
<v Speaker 2>actual deterrence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4080
02:48:13.640 --> 02:48:17.600
<v Speaker 2>off the table and more of a removal of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the nuclear threat.</v>

4081
02:48:18.680 --> 02:48:20.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're just going to be doing this same</v>

4082
02:48:20.031 --> 02:48:23.300
<v Speaker 2>conversation in another couple of years</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they rattle the cage again and we</v>

4083
02:48:23.301 --> 02:48:26.900
<v Speaker 2>have to figure out how to resolve it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the further you go down the road and</v>

4084
02:48:26.901 --> 02:48:29.780
<v Speaker 2>the better their capabilities get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fewer options you have.</v>

4085
02:48:29.840 --> 02:48:30.970
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well mike,</v>

4086
02:48:30.971 --> 02:48:33.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm sufficiently depressed.</v>

<v Speaker 2>your insight.</v>

4090
02:48:42.560 --> 02:48:44.840
<v Speaker 2>I went off on a tangent there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't we both did.</v>

4091
02:48:45.330 --> 02:48:46.820
<v Speaker 2>That's part of the program.</v>
