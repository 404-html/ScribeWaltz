00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.051
<v Speaker 1>Try My day,</v>

2
00:00:01.051 --> 00:00:03.720
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.</v>

3
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.400
<v Speaker 1>That'd be the best in the world.</v>

4
00:00:05.401 --> 00:00:06.234
<v Speaker 1>You've seen his posters.</v>

5
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.250
<v Speaker 1>He's the one that does all those crazy posters.</v>

6
00:00:08.251 --> 00:00:08.790
<v Speaker 1>Dope.</v>

7
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:09.050
<v Speaker 1>Dope.</v>

8
00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:10.070
<v Speaker 1>Paul Jacobs,</v>

9
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.780
<v Speaker 1>he the one that did Conor McGregor in an MMA glove punching Floyd in the mouth.</v>

10
00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:14.610
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

11
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.220
<v Speaker 1>Here's The New York one with all the dope stuff.</v>

12
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:17.641
<v Speaker 1>Let me tell you,</v>

13
00:00:17.641 --> 00:00:19.290
<v Speaker 1>here's where kind of McGregor to win.</v>

14
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.190
<v Speaker 1>Here's where Conor Mcgregor,</v>

15
00:00:20.191 --> 00:00:22.380
<v Speaker 1>he can win MMA gloves.</v>

16
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.760
<v Speaker 1>Let's have a boxing match with MFA groups.</v>

17
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you need to do that if Floyd's ha at boys had some serious</v>

18
00:00:29.191 --> 00:00:30.540
<v Speaker 1>problems in the past with his hands.</v>

19
00:00:30.541 --> 00:00:30.960
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

20
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.300
<v Speaker 1>And he uses those big ass pillow gloves because of it.</v>

21
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.700
<v Speaker 1>And he's been known to not really sit down and he's punching.</v>

22
00:00:35.701 --> 00:00:36.720
<v Speaker 1>Just picks guys apart.</v>

23
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.980
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt about it.</v>

24
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.570
<v Speaker 1>Floyd is a masterful boxer,</v>

25
00:00:39.571 --> 00:00:43.590
<v Speaker 1>but that's a big transition for him to fighting with small gloves.</v>

26
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.310
<v Speaker 1>He's never been as big as the transition is for Connor to fight with bigger</v>

27
00:00:47.311 --> 00:00:48.144
<v Speaker 1>gloves.</v>

28
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.120
<v Speaker 1>They're going to do boxing.</v>

29
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.760
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>

30
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.160
<v Speaker 1>I honestly think with how Connor moves,</v>

31
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.180
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

32
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.781
<v Speaker 1>don't get me wrong.</v>

33
00:00:54.781 --> 00:00:55.950
<v Speaker 1>Floyd's one of the best of all time,</v>

34
00:00:55.951 --> 00:00:56.784
<v Speaker 1>if not the best,</v>

35
00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.440
<v Speaker 1>but it's a lot for them to adapt to.</v>

36
00:00:58.441 --> 00:00:59.280
<v Speaker 1>Connor's big.</v>

37
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:00.540
<v Speaker 1>He gets fucking hard.</v>

38
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:01.980
<v Speaker 1>He can go both ways.</v>

39
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.993
<v Speaker 1>We'll see.</v>

40
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.571
<v Speaker 1>We'll see.</v>

41
00:01:03.571 --> 00:01:05.080
<v Speaker 1>I want to see what we get.</v>

42
00:01:05.081 --> 00:01:06.210
<v Speaker 1>All of the work that he's going to have.</v>

43
00:01:06.211 --> 00:01:06.870
<v Speaker 1>It's in.</v>

44
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.991
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

45
00:01:06.991 --> 00:01:11.991
<v Speaker 1>is he the one that did the fucking Joey Diaz and me fucking collar beam has got</v>

46
00:01:13.021 --> 00:01:15.050
<v Speaker 1>them chili with his gum flat</v>

47
00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.923
<v Speaker 1>fucking cop,</v>

48
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.620
<v Speaker 1>so he's fine out of his mouth.</v>

49
00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.880
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

50
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:21.580
<v Speaker 1>he's an animal.</v>

51
00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:22.321
<v Speaker 1>Can't really fight.</v>

52
00:01:22.321 --> 00:01:22.981
<v Speaker 1>That's not going to happen.</v>

53
00:01:22.981 --> 00:01:23.340
<v Speaker 1>That fight.</v>

54
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.000
<v Speaker 1>Hey Dude,</v>

55
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.380
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot of fucking money.</v>

56
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:26.243
<v Speaker 1>Here's the deal.</v>

57
00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.070
<v Speaker 1>You made 300,000 by.</v>

58
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.150
<v Speaker 1>Dana had a real good point.</v>

59
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:30.631
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

60
00:01:30.631 --> 00:01:33.230
<v Speaker 1>Connor's last two paper views where 1.3 million,</v>

61
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.081
<v Speaker 1>1.5 million,</v>

62
00:01:34.081 --> 00:01:36.960
<v Speaker 1>he goes Floyd's was 300,000 and it's a great poison.</v>

63
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.080
<v Speaker 1>Floyd's asking for 500 million or 400 million.</v>

64
00:01:40.081 --> 00:01:40.620
<v Speaker 1>Rather.</v>

65
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.921
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

66
00:01:40.921 --> 00:01:41.731
<v Speaker 1>you're out of your fucking mind.</v>

67
00:01:41.731 --> 00:01:41.911
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

68
00:01:41.911 --> 00:01:42.744
<v Speaker 1>here's a real deal.</v>

69
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.400
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you 25 million.</v>

70
00:01:44.401 --> 00:01:47.480
<v Speaker 1>I'll give Connor 25 billion and then we'll talk about paper review after you've</v>

71
00:01:47.481 --> 00:01:48.790
<v Speaker 1>written them a thousand from Reebok,</v>

72
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.770
<v Speaker 1>you get 4,000 not a championship fight,</v>

73
00:01:52.771 --> 00:01:53.604
<v Speaker 1>but it's a main event.</v>

74
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.471
<v Speaker 1>Oh Mom,</v>

75
00:01:55.471 --> 00:01:55.831
<v Speaker 1>look at this.</v>

76
00:01:55.831 --> 00:01:56.280
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

77
00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.790
<v Speaker 1>Hey Be,</v>

78
00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:57.930
<v Speaker 1>this is why it's getting serious.</v>

79
00:01:57.931 --> 00:02:01.380
<v Speaker 1>Cause Dana addresses it made an offer on national TV.</v>

80
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.320
<v Speaker 1>Floyd was on showtime last night and they go,</v>

81
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.960
<v Speaker 1>is there any boxer that could bring you out of retirement?</v>

82
00:02:06.961 --> 00:02:07.171
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

83
00:02:07.171 --> 00:02:07.620
<v Speaker 1>nope.</v>

84
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.950
<v Speaker 1>The only fight that would get me out of retirement is Conor McGregor is the only</v>

85
00:02:10.951 --> 00:02:11.784
<v Speaker 1>fight I want.</v>

86
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.860
<v Speaker 1>He knows there's so much money in that fight.</v>

87
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.820
<v Speaker 1>Conor McGregor is a God damn fucking happened.</v>

88
00:02:17.821 --> 00:02:18.391
<v Speaker 1>But see,</v>

89
00:02:18.391 --> 00:02:21.870
<v Speaker 1>the thing is that's a fight that would transcend into the total casual person</v>

90
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.390
<v Speaker 1>the same way the Ronda Rousey fights do.</v>

91
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.420
<v Speaker 1>But this soul dump on concrete million though.</v>

92
00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.920
<v Speaker 1>This might be like 3 million because he might be like such a freak show,</v>

93
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.420
<v Speaker 1>but he likes three,</v>

94
00:02:33.421 --> 00:02:34.254
<v Speaker 1>four Mil.</v>

95
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.730
<v Speaker 1>I think so Andrea,</v>

96
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.721
<v Speaker 1>what would you say?</v>

97
00:02:39.721 --> 00:02:41.460
<v Speaker 1>Like the biggest paper you fight ever?</v>

98
00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.800
<v Speaker 1>Like what was the number number one of all time?</v>

99
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:45.711
<v Speaker 1>This pack.</v>

100
00:02:45.711 --> 00:02:47.580
<v Speaker 1>Y'All may one is that the biggest of all time,</v>

101
00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.473
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

102
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.310
<v Speaker 1>Before we look at the numbers,</v>

103
00:02:50.311 --> 00:02:51.144
<v Speaker 1>let's guess,</v>

104
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to say 2.5 is that the biggest ever?</v>

105
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.163
<v Speaker 1>I'm say</v>

106
00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying almost three two point it is for that fight.</v>

107
00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.840
<v Speaker 1>It is for Pacquiao.</v>

108
00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:00.300
<v Speaker 1>Mayweather,</v>

109
00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.480
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

110
00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.850
<v Speaker 1>but I'll,</v>

111
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:01.421
<v Speaker 1>it's you're,</v>

112
00:03:01.421 --> 00:03:02.320
<v Speaker 1>you're off on the numbers.</v>

113
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.920
<v Speaker 1>What's the number?</v>

114
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:03.920
<v Speaker 1>I think it's five right?</v>

115
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:04.920
<v Speaker 1>4.6 mil.</v>

116
00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:06.570
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

117
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.690
<v Speaker 1>Connor and them.</v>

118
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.981
<v Speaker 1>But Damn,</v>

119
00:03:08.981 --> 00:03:12.460
<v Speaker 1>how much might it may work mother making that fight revenue of 400 million.</v>

120
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:13.840
<v Speaker 1>Oh my Jesus.</v>

121
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.260
<v Speaker 1>So he probably made at least a hundred plus million that didn't,</v>

122
00:03:17.261 --> 00:03:20.800
<v Speaker 1>they say made 150 160 million impact.</v>

123
00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.650
<v Speaker 1>Y'all made like 80 or a hundred but him and Connor,</v>

124
00:03:23.651 --> 00:03:24.370
<v Speaker 1>you're getting,</v>

125
00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.450
<v Speaker 1>even if you hate Connor,</v>

126
00:03:25.451 --> 00:03:28.090
<v Speaker 1>you're still getting all those MMA fans cause he represents us.</v>

127
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:29.230
<v Speaker 1>Even though you hate Floyd,</v>

128
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.550
<v Speaker 1>get all those boxes and fans.</v>

129
00:03:30.551 --> 00:03:33.010
<v Speaker 1>Even if you hate Floyd and then the two worlds just go.</v>

130
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.770
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

131
00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:34.603
<v Speaker 1>Josh,</v>

132
00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:35.680
<v Speaker 1>do you think that he can,</v>

133
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.010
<v Speaker 1>that they can make it up to that level that you think,</v>

134
00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.890
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

135
00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:39.723
<v Speaker 1>I want to know.</v>

136
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.110
<v Speaker 1>I want to know why Conor or how Connor isn't concerned.</v>

137
00:03:44.111 --> 00:03:45.710
<v Speaker 1>He'll get knocked out in the first round.</v>

138
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:46.600
<v Speaker 1>Nothing to lose.</v>

139
00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.060
<v Speaker 1>He won't get knocked out in the first shot.</v>

140
00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.430
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

141
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:49.560
<v Speaker 1>he won't get knocked down the first time.</v>

142
00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:50.400
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't work that way.</v>

143
00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.730
<v Speaker 1>As a,</v>

144
00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:51.150
<v Speaker 1>you mean you,</v>

145
00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.670
<v Speaker 1>you can protect yourself against even somebody that could cause very high level</v>

146
00:03:54.671 --> 00:03:55.960
<v Speaker 1>and quick and,</v>

147
00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.140
<v Speaker 1>and also it doesn't hit that hard.</v>

148
00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.010
<v Speaker 1>Con is a lot bigger,</v>

149
00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.023
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

150
00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.930
<v Speaker 1>of moves different than a lot of boxers do because he's so used to leg kicks.</v>

151
00:04:04.931 --> 00:04:07.690
<v Speaker 1>He's still used to take downs and he has a different stance.</v>

152
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.100
<v Speaker 1>That alone will be,</v>

153
00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.860
<v Speaker 1>we'll take a little bit of time for me where the to adjust to,</v>

154
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.610
<v Speaker 1>but Mayweather has the ability to be in the right place at the right time.</v>

155
00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:16.100
<v Speaker 1>Always.</v>

156
00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.410
<v Speaker 1>So deceptive.</v>

157
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.590
<v Speaker 1>It's so deceptive because it doesn't look like he's doing anything special,</v>

158
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.060
<v Speaker 1>but if you watch the way he's moving,</v>

159
00:04:22.061 --> 00:04:24.400
<v Speaker 1>he's never had a position and he's always popping.</v>

160
00:04:24.401 --> 00:04:29.401
<v Speaker 1>You went to that chap and he's still even at (373) 083-0930 nine or it might be</v>

161
00:04:29.981 --> 00:04:31.940
<v Speaker 1>40 lightning fast and take it.</v>

162
00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.550
<v Speaker 1>Especially lately though,</v>

163
00:04:33.551 --> 00:04:35.260
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't take advantage of getting out of the way.</v>

164
00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.821
<v Speaker 1>He's kind of,</v>

165
00:04:35.821 --> 00:04:39.110
<v Speaker 1>he's winning rounds with the Jab dicon and dodging.</v>

166
00:04:39.111 --> 00:04:39.890
<v Speaker 1>Get out of the way.</v>

167
00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:40.360
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

168
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.380
<v Speaker 1>I just don't got it.</v>

169
00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.030
<v Speaker 1>I think for common though,</v>

170
00:04:43.031 --> 00:04:43.840
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

171
00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.430
<v Speaker 1>it's a win win for you.</v>

172
00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.640
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if Connor lands the left hand.</v>

173
00:04:48.641 --> 00:04:51.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying that ain't gonna happen,</v>

174
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:53.171
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

175
00:04:53.171 --> 00:04:53.770
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

176
00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:54.910
<v Speaker 1>Connor fought,</v>

177
00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:55.781
<v Speaker 1>I mean rather,</v>

178
00:04:55.781 --> 00:04:56.100
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

179
00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.900
<v Speaker 1>Floyd fought Ricardo Mayorga.</v>

180
00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:58.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

181
00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.931
<v Speaker 1>And no,</v>

182
00:04:58.931 --> 00:05:00.910
<v Speaker 1>not recording my orga you're thinking of Madonna,</v>

183
00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:01.500
<v Speaker 1>Madonna.</v>

184
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:02.310
<v Speaker 1>Mark was my Donna,</v>

185
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.990
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

186
00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.860
<v Speaker 1>Donna connected at the end of one of the rounds.</v>

187
00:05:05.861 --> 00:05:07.980
<v Speaker 1>He connected with a big fucking right man.</v>

188
00:05:07.981 --> 00:05:10.780
<v Speaker 1>And they had had him sit down for a second.</v>

189
00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:14.270
<v Speaker 1>Did he hit 100% but excuse me,</v>

190
00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:16.630
<v Speaker 1>he still,</v>

191
00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.100
<v Speaker 1>he's really hot on one shoulder.</v>

192
00:05:18.101 --> 00:05:18.260
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

193
00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.711
<v Speaker 1>there's really no,</v>

194
00:05:18.711 --> 00:05:18.790
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

195
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.941
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

196
00:05:18.941 --> 00:05:19.150
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

197
00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:20.080
<v Speaker 1>There's a really only once,</v>

198
00:05:20.081 --> 00:05:20.920
<v Speaker 1>but it was the first fight.</v>

199
00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:21.581
<v Speaker 1>The second fight,</v>

200
00:05:21.581 --> 00:05:22.510
<v Speaker 1>Floyd boxes,</v>

201
00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:24.271
<v Speaker 1>Jane Walk.</v>

202
00:05:24.271 --> 00:05:25.120
<v Speaker 1>They will see it here.</v>

203
00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.511
<v Speaker 1>See?</v>

204
00:05:25.511 --> 00:05:26.680
<v Speaker 1>And my Donna is,</v>

205
00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:27.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

206
00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:28.510
<v Speaker 1>murderous puncher just,</v>

207
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.550
<v Speaker 1>and he would throw those crazy chocolate,</v>

208
00:05:30.551 --> 00:05:31.960
<v Speaker 1>Dell style overhand rights.</v>

209
00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.070
<v Speaker 1>So he's all over a Floyd here and at the end was one of the rounds.</v>

210
00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:36.963
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>

211
00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:38.020
<v Speaker 1>But listen,</v>

212
00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.540
<v Speaker 1>this guy is way smaller than Conor.</v>

213
00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:41.403
<v Speaker 1>Let's think of this.</v>

214
00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.970
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about a guy here that's fighting one 47 one 54 Connor,</v>

215
00:05:45.971 --> 00:05:49.870
<v Speaker 1>although he's made it down to one 45 he's physically much larger than this guy.</v>

216
00:05:49.871 --> 00:05:51.090
<v Speaker 1>Connor was walking around.</v>

217
00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:52.030
<v Speaker 1>Am I love that you guys aren't gonna.</v>

218
00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:53.810
<v Speaker 1>He won't put a glove on him and,</v>

219
00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.150
<v Speaker 1>and he will not hit him.</v>

220
00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:55.821
<v Speaker 1>And I think floor,</v>

221
00:05:55.821 --> 00:05:58.210
<v Speaker 1>it's going to do whatever want you want to bet,</v>

222
00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:58.660
<v Speaker 1>Brian.</v>

223
00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:00.470
<v Speaker 1>If you want to bet that re lance one,</v>

224
00:06:00.471 --> 00:06:00.861
<v Speaker 1>Sean,</v>

225
00:06:00.861 --> 00:06:02.060
<v Speaker 1>you pay none of them off.</v>

226
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.180
<v Speaker 1>It's a very strange Connor.</v>

227
00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.670
<v Speaker 1>He always loses a Conor McGregor is you won't land a shot.</v>

228
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:08.240
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

229
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.120
<v Speaker 1>Can You pour me some?</v>

230
00:06:09.121 --> 00:06:09.500
<v Speaker 1>No one.</v>

231
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:09.970
<v Speaker 1>Not at night.</v>

232
00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:11.240
<v Speaker 1>He's starting to something more on a clean.</v>

233
00:06:11.241 --> 00:06:12.011
<v Speaker 1>She up to me and Joe.</v>

234
00:06:12.011 --> 00:06:12.780
<v Speaker 1>No pouring some more.</v>

235
00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:13.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

236
00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:14.760
<v Speaker 1>what I do know is a great fighters have,</v>

237
00:06:14.761 --> 00:06:15.800
<v Speaker 1>they haven't done it.</v>

238
00:06:15.801 --> 00:06:16.410
<v Speaker 1>Haven't we a,</v>

239
00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:16.641
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

240
00:06:16.641 --> 00:06:17.930
<v Speaker 1>I know that he may have no doubt,</v>

241
00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.910
<v Speaker 1>no doubt any pat Carroll look clumsy.</v>

242
00:06:19.911 --> 00:06:20.571
<v Speaker 1>I know that.</v>

243
00:06:20.571 --> 00:06:20.810
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

244
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:21.290
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

245
00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:22.070
<v Speaker 1>I'll have one arm.</v>

246
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.760
<v Speaker 1>I know that.</v>

247
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:23.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

248
00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:23.610
<v Speaker 1>look at this.</v>

249
00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:24.620
<v Speaker 1>He's done it to everybody.</v>

250
00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:24.801
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

251
00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:25.330
<v Speaker 1>see my,</v>

252
00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.070
<v Speaker 1>I clipped him there with a left or a right uppercut rather,</v>

253
00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:29.130
<v Speaker 1>but at the end of a,</v>

254
00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:30.110
<v Speaker 1>one of the Hoa dues,</v>

255
00:06:30.111 --> 00:06:33.050
<v Speaker 1>beautiful box factory wants,</v>

256
00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:33.531
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

257
00:06:33.531 --> 00:06:37.100
<v Speaker 1>you don't get to be 49 and now without being fucking sensation now just don't,</v>

258
00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:38.930
<v Speaker 1>he's the best defensive boxer of all time.</v>

259
00:06:38.931 --> 00:06:39.380
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

260
00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:39.681
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

261
00:06:39.681 --> 00:06:40.400
<v Speaker 1>I would say so.</v>

262
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.233
<v Speaker 1>I would say so.</v>

263
00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

264
00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.390
<v Speaker 1>he's two years,</v>

265
00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:45.510
<v Speaker 1>Pernell Whitaker loss.</v>

266
00:06:45.511 --> 00:06:46.850
<v Speaker 1>Later on in his career,</v>

267
00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.490
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't able to sustain it as long as Mayweather has.</v>

268
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:50.151
<v Speaker 1>So what may,</v>

269
00:06:50.151 --> 00:06:53.360
<v Speaker 1>where there's been able to do is sustain it better than anybody and also keep</v>

270
00:06:53.361 --> 00:06:54.130
<v Speaker 1>improving.</v>

271
00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:54.420
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

272
00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:56.960
<v Speaker 1>Can mean like when he fought Canelo he,</v>

273
00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:00.350
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people thought Canelo was gonna give him a hard time and young Canelo</v>

274
00:07:00.351 --> 00:07:01.200
<v Speaker 1>he's too big for him.</v>

275
00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:02.470
<v Speaker 1>You Fuck Canelo up.</v>

276
00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:12.550
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
