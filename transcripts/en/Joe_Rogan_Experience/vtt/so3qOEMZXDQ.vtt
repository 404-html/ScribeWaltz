1
00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.230
<v Speaker 1>Three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

2
00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:06.663
<v Speaker 1>one</v>

3
00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.340
<v Speaker 2>cool thing going on here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we'll circle,</v>

4
00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:13.080
<v Speaker 2>oh jeff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>merry Christmas.</v>

5
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:13.943
<v Speaker 2>What's up Joe?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Youtube not been the easiest week in my </v>

6
00:00:17.731 --> 00:00:18.564
<v Speaker 2>life or my career is last week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but hanging in there to make this a </v>

7
00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.220
<v Speaker 2>standalone so that people don't have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go figuring this out on their own.</v>

8
00:00:26.431 --> 00:00:29.040
<v Speaker 2>And I'm sure many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many fans are tuning in already.</v>

9
00:00:29.041 --> 00:00:30.810
<v Speaker 2>Know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The gist of the details,</v>

10
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.020
<v Speaker 2>let's lay this out from the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>John Jones.</v>

11
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.870
<v Speaker 2>Initial failed test.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

12
00:00:36.871 --> 00:00:41.871
<v Speaker 2>So that was July of 2017 he tested </v>
<v Speaker 2>positive for approximately 20,</v>

13
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.020
<v Speaker 2>anywhere from 20 to 60 Pika grams of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>longterm metabolite known as the m three</v>

14
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.880
<v Speaker 2>metabolite of a substance called to </v>
<v Speaker 2>hydro chloral methyl testosterone,</v>

15
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.390
<v Speaker 2>Dh cmt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>also known as oral to rentable.</v>

16
00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.630
<v Speaker 2>And this was over a year ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

17
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.500
<v Speaker 2>what was determined to be the source of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this stuff,</v>

18
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:05.393
<v Speaker 2>never determined what the source was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So John went through a full arbitration </v>

19
00:01:09.091 --> 00:01:10.620
<v Speaker 2>hearing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

20
00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.020
<v Speaker 2>was never able to determine where it </v>
<v Speaker 2>came from.</v>

21
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.100
<v Speaker 2>Tested all the supplements he was using,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

22
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.570
<v Speaker 2>went through many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

23
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.940
<v Speaker 2>interviews with Usada,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had a full on arbitration hearing.</v>

24
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.100
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the source was never determined where it</v>

25
00:01:23.101 --> 00:01:23.934
<v Speaker 2>came from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why was his suspension so low or so </v>

26
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.193
<v Speaker 2>short?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

27
00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.123
<v Speaker 2>I mean it wasn't that determined.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean there's many factors that go </v>

28
00:01:32.041 --> 00:01:36.330
<v Speaker 2>into what that suspension was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would argue in the toe tap totality of</v>

29
00:01:36.331 --> 00:01:39.180
<v Speaker 2>the evidence that was presented in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>arbitration that it,</v>

30
00:01:39.181 --> 00:01:42.240
<v Speaker 2>that it wasn't a short suspension.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

31
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.570
<v Speaker 2>because really one key thing came out at</v>
<v Speaker 2>arbitration.</v>

32
00:01:45.571 --> 00:01:46.404
<v Speaker 2>So John went to arbitration before an </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual by the name of Richard </v>

33
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.560
<v Speaker 2>Mclaren.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Richard Mclaren has an arbitration group</v>

34
00:01:52.561 --> 00:01:53.394
<v Speaker 2>up in Canada and Mclaren is probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>worldwide known as one of the most </v>

35
00:01:57.211 --> 00:01:58.044
<v Speaker 2>credible guys in anti-doping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you had the ICARUS producer </v>

36
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:07.370
<v Speaker 2>director on the Mclaren report was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>report that came from all that.</v>

37
00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.710
<v Speaker 2>He basically investigated the Russian </v>
<v Speaker 2>state being involved in doping and Sochi</v>

38
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.750
<v Speaker 2>Games and put out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually a series of reports on it,</v>

39
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.780
<v Speaker 2>detailing it up to 1000 Russian </v>
<v Speaker 2>athletes.</v>

40
00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:19.800
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

41
00:02:19.801 --> 00:02:20.634
<v Speaker 2>we're breaking the rules and the Russian</v>
<v Speaker 2>laboratory was helping them get around </v>

42
00:02:23.551 --> 00:02:25.200
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's a very,</v>

43
00:02:25.201 --> 00:02:29.220
<v Speaker 2>very respected guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's independent of obviously the UFC.</v>

44
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.990
<v Speaker 2>He's independent of Usada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

45
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.850
<v Speaker 2>he acts on his own and his determination</v>
<v Speaker 2>was his determination.</v>

46
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.760
<v Speaker 2>And I'll read you kind of what he said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

47
00:02:38.761 --> 00:02:39.594
<v Speaker 2>I find that all evidence available to me</v>
<v Speaker 2>leads me to conclude that the violation </v>

48
00:02:44.161 --> 00:02:48.660
<v Speaker 2>was not intended,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nor could it have enhanced the athletes'</v>

49
00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.513
<v Speaker 2>performance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a non-intentional so not </v>

50
00:02:53.091 --> 00:02:54.300
<v Speaker 2>unintentional ingestion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

51
00:02:54.301 --> 00:02:55.134
<v Speaker 2>there's no argument that it was in his </v>
<v Speaker 2>system that he found the evidence to </v>

52
00:02:57.181 --> 00:02:58.014
<v Speaker 2>show non-intentional use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he went further saying that </v>

53
00:03:01.391 --> 00:03:02.224
<v Speaker 2>based on the numbers of what he saw and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the evidence that was not even a </v>

54
00:03:05.201 --> 00:03:06.034
<v Speaker 2>performance enhancing benefit afforded </v>
<v Speaker 2>to John for having this longterm </v>

55
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.540
<v Speaker 2>metabolite in his system.</v>

56
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.720
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's significant when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about hey,</v>

57
00:03:13.721 --> 00:03:15.700
<v Speaker 2>15 months is that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

58
00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.130
<v Speaker 2>kind of light being that this is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>second time through.</v>

59
00:03:18.131 --> 00:03:18.964
<v Speaker 2>I would argue that if there was an </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument that maybe it's on the higher </v>

60
00:03:22.241 --> 00:03:23.750
<v Speaker 2>end and certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

61
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.750
<v Speaker 2>we'll talk about the California </v>
<v Speaker 2>commission.</v>

62
00:03:25.751 --> 00:03:28.510
<v Speaker 2>Andy Foster took that position,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

63
00:03:28.511 --> 00:03:32.410
<v Speaker 2>in John's recent California hearing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a little bit critical of Usada.</v>

64
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.300
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he thought,</v>

65
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.253
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's intimately familiar with this </v>

66
00:03:36.191 --> 00:03:39.310
<v Speaker 2>evidence both in the previous case and </v>
<v Speaker 2>this occurrence that,</v>

67
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.240
<v Speaker 2>and he also saw that there was no </v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence that an independent arbitrator,</v>

68
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>made this statement and decision of John</v>

69
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.120
<v Speaker 2>Intentionally cheating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

70
00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.380
<v Speaker 2>so if anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

71
00:03:50.381 --> 00:03:52.800
<v Speaker 2>I'd say that potentially there could be </v>
<v Speaker 2>an argument that,</v>

72
00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.030
<v Speaker 2>that it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

73
00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.873
<v Speaker 2>on the higher end versus the lower end </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of the fact that it was an </v>

74
00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:58.840
<v Speaker 2>unintentional ingestion.</v>

75
00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.540
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now what is John's excuse?</v>

76
00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.351
<v Speaker 2>What is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is,</v>

77
00:04:02.351 --> 00:04:03.184
<v Speaker 2>John said how he got this into a system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll look and it's detailed in the </v>

78
00:04:07.361 --> 00:04:10.210
<v Speaker 2>arbitration hearing at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>John John fully admits that,</v>

79
00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the lifestyle,</v>

80
00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.810
<v Speaker 2>lifestyle decisions he was making,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

81
00:04:13.811 --> 00:04:15.790
<v Speaker 2>the partying and things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

82
00:04:15.791 --> 00:04:16.624
<v Speaker 2>probably did not lead to making smart </v>
<v Speaker 2>decisions and making smart choices in </v>

83
00:04:20.381 --> 00:04:22.990
<v Speaker 2>terms of what was being ingested in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>

84
00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:24.183
<v Speaker 2>But certainly his testimony was under </v>
<v Speaker 2>oath that I have never intentionally </v>

85
00:04:27.761 --> 00:04:31.300
<v Speaker 2>cheated and did not intentionally put </v>
<v Speaker 2>this substance in my body.</v>

86
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:32.163
<v Speaker 2>And not only this case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it as we talk about the subsequent </v>

87
00:04:34.691 --> 00:04:35.524
<v Speaker 2>case here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you'll see that based on the </v>

88
00:04:37.961 --> 00:04:38.980
<v Speaker 2>numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

89
00:04:38.981 --> 00:04:43.330
<v Speaker 2>coming out of his tests and based on </v>
<v Speaker 2>some studies that have been done on some</v>

90
00:04:43.331 --> 00:04:45.580
<v Speaker 2>of these substances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would tend to support that.</v>

91
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.140
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>correct me if I'm wrong,</v>

92
00:04:47.141 --> 00:04:52.141
<v Speaker 2>but didn't John tests negative then test</v>
<v Speaker 2>positive for extremely low numbers?</v>

93
00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.140
<v Speaker 2>This is the initial test before we get </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the most recent field test she did.</v>

94
00:04:56.141 --> 00:04:56.974
<v Speaker 2>So that's negative then test positive </v>
<v Speaker 2>very shortly after with a very small </v>

95
00:05:02.021 --> 00:05:03.100
<v Speaker 2>trace amounts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

96
00:05:03.101 --> 00:05:06.520
<v Speaker 2>So you have two negative tests on July </v>
<v Speaker 2>7th and July 8th,</v>

97
00:05:06.521 --> 00:05:10.090
<v Speaker 2>I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of 2017 and then weigh in day,</v>

98
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.953
<v Speaker 2>I think it was July 28th he was positive</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a very low level of the m three </v>

99
00:05:15.221 --> 00:05:18.130
<v Speaker 2>metabolite and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we might as well start here.</v>

100
00:05:18.131 --> 00:05:20.740
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going back to ICARUS,</v>

101
00:05:20.741 --> 00:05:22.120
<v Speaker 2>remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember the doctor,</v>

102
00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's the main character in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>were chink of,</v>

103
00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:30.030
<v Speaker 2>in 2011 he put out a study on oral </v>
<v Speaker 2>Terenna Ball.</v>

104
00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:31.960
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he actually,</v>

105
00:05:31.961 --> 00:05:32.794
<v Speaker 2>my understanding is dosed himself and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then studied the excretion of his urine </v>

106
00:05:37.751 --> 00:05:38.584
<v Speaker 2>and what was coming out of it over the </v>
<v Speaker 2>weeks and months after and determined </v>

107
00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:42.723
<v Speaker 2>that there were multiple maybe up to 50 </v>
<v Speaker 2>metabolites that once this Dh cmt was </v>

108
00:05:48.251 --> 00:05:52.570
<v Speaker 2>ingested into the body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the body converted into other substances</v>

109
00:05:52.571 --> 00:05:54.490
<v Speaker 2>and these metabolites stayed around.</v>

110
00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:55.323
<v Speaker 2>He identified some short term,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some medium term metabolites and some </v>

111
00:06:00.621 --> 00:06:01.454
<v Speaker 2>longterm metabolites,</v>
<v Speaker 2>specifically the m three that John's </v>

112
00:06:03.471 --> 00:06:04.304
<v Speaker 2>tested positive for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So these longterm metabolites would </v>

113
00:06:07.041 --> 00:06:09.380
<v Speaker 2>indicate that it was taken long time </v>
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>

114
00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.770
<v Speaker 2>They would stay around for the longest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why,</v>

115
00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.530
<v Speaker 2>why was he testing negative and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>testing positive for these extremely,</v>

116
00:06:15.531 --> 00:06:16.940
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the numbers.</v>

117
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:19.670
<v Speaker 2>That's a good question and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's basically the question,</v>

118
00:06:19.671 --> 00:06:20.504
<v Speaker 2>that point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what was not occurring and what has </v>

119
00:06:22.281 --> 00:06:23.114
<v Speaker 2>never occurred in any of John's samples </v>
<v Speaker 2>is any presence of the short and medium </v>

120
00:06:28.821 --> 00:06:33.821
<v Speaker 2>term metabolites.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you look at a [inaudible] study,</v>

121
00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:38.000
<v Speaker 2>he identifies a couple of these medium </v>
<v Speaker 2>term metabolites,</v>

122
00:06:38.001 --> 00:06:38.834
<v Speaker 2>Roman numeral one and Roman numeral two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he says these metabolites based on </v>

123
00:06:43.251 --> 00:06:46.580
<v Speaker 2>his study will stay in the body at least</v>
<v Speaker 2>22 days.</v>

124
00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:48.453
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's look back to the July 7th and </v>

125
00:06:49.611 --> 00:06:51.170
<v Speaker 2>eighth you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>positive tests.</v>

126
00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:53.840
<v Speaker 2>He's negative on July 7th and eighth for</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

127
00:06:53.841 --> 00:06:56.600
<v Speaker 2>For the parent compound,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the short term,</v>

128
00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:01.630
<v Speaker 2>medium term term metabolites and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>longterm metabolites go 2021 days later.</v>

129
00:07:04.161 --> 00:07:04.994
<v Speaker 2>So within that 22 day window,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is study shows the short and </v>

130
00:07:07.431 --> 00:07:08.264
<v Speaker 2>medium term metabolites would still be </v>
<v Speaker 2>showing up and there's no presence </v>

131
00:07:11.121 --> 00:07:14.510
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever of the short or medium term </v>
<v Speaker 2>metabolites.</v>

132
00:07:14.511 --> 00:07:17.090
<v Speaker 2>Now again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll get into this a little bit more,</v>

133
00:07:17.091 --> 00:07:17.924
<v Speaker 2>but I think the science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it's showing is a pulsing effect </v>

134
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:25.400
<v Speaker 2>for this longterm metabolite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meaning once you ingest,</v>

135
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:26.263
<v Speaker 2>whether intentionally or not </v>
<v Speaker 2>unintentionally oral Terenna ball into </v>

136
00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.450
<v Speaker 2>the body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the body breaks it down,</v>

137
00:07:32.451 --> 00:07:35.570
<v Speaker 2>produces short term and medium term,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is you know,</v>

138
00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:38.360
<v Speaker 2>visible for a short and medium amount of</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

139
00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:42.440
<v Speaker 2>And then this end three which is </v>
<v Speaker 2>produced for a long period of time.</v>

140
00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:46.700
<v Speaker 2>I think with the issue appears to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we'll get into this,</v>

141
00:07:46.701 --> 00:07:49.520
<v Speaker 2>the UFC program is not the only program </v>
<v Speaker 2>had seen this.</v>

142
00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:53.240
<v Speaker 2>There's another professional sports </v>
<v Speaker 2>league that has seen it very frequently.</v>

143
00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.940
<v Speaker 2>You saw it as also seen this on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Olympic side,</v>

144
00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:00.980
<v Speaker 2>but we're seeing this strange action </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the longterm and three metabolite.</v>

145
00:08:00.981 --> 00:08:01.814
<v Speaker 2>And the theory is it may be hiding in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fat tissues surrounding organs and </v>

146
00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:07.943
<v Speaker 2>maybe have a pulsing effect where it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>released at certain times and other </v>

147
00:08:11.481 --> 00:08:12.314
<v Speaker 2>times you can't detect it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is not the actual substance </v>

148
00:08:15.321 --> 00:08:17.080
<v Speaker 2>itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a metabolite correct.</v>

149
00:08:17.081 --> 00:08:20.150
<v Speaker 2>Which indicates a reaction to this </v>
<v Speaker 2>substance in the body,</v>

150
00:08:20.151 --> 00:08:20.984
<v Speaker 2>breaking down the parent compound the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the oral Terenna ball and turning it </v>

151
00:08:24.381 --> 00:08:26.670
<v Speaker 2>into these other things which are stored</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the body.</v>

152
00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:27.543
<v Speaker 2>Those metabolites are not performance </v>
<v Speaker 2>enhancing drugs that are the result of </v>

153
00:08:30.591 --> 00:08:33.380
<v Speaker 2>the breakdown of the parent drug in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>

154
00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:38.120
<v Speaker 2>How much time is it detectable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the actual drug itself?</v>

155
00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:39.530
<v Speaker 2>So pretty quick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

156
00:08:39.531 --> 00:08:40.970
<v Speaker 2>it's a pretty quick clearance time.</v>

157
00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:43.010
<v Speaker 2>I think we're Cenk Golf Studies says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

158
00:08:43.011 --> 00:08:44.260
<v Speaker 2>maybe a week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

159
00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:45.133
<v Speaker 2>so it's not around for very long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why he conducted the study </v>

160
00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:48.883
<v Speaker 2>ironically enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was going to go watch bicker is </v>

161
00:08:50.961 --> 00:08:51.794
<v Speaker 2>here last night and I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had too much going on in the last </v>

162
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.640
<v Speaker 2>week to kind of refresh mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

163
00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:57.503
<v Speaker 2>apparently he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he knew this was part of his protocol </v>

164
00:09:00.061 --> 00:09:00.894
<v Speaker 2>for Russian athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He knew a coach that was still giving </v>

165
00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:04.703
<v Speaker 2>the oral Terenna ball to Russian </v>
<v Speaker 2>athletes and he had a falling out with </v>

166
00:09:06.991 --> 00:09:10.650
<v Speaker 2>the coach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he goes off on the side and studies,</v>

167
00:09:10.651 --> 00:09:11.484
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the parent compound is going to get in </v>

168
00:09:13.201 --> 00:09:14.034
<v Speaker 2>and out of the body pretty quick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be difficult to detect </v>

169
00:09:15.871 --> 00:09:16.704
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's try to figure out what stays </v>

170
00:09:17.791 --> 00:09:20.250
<v Speaker 2>around and leaves markers in the body </v>
<v Speaker 2>for a long time.</v>

171
00:09:20.251 --> 00:09:21.084
<v Speaker 2>And so he developed the short and </v>
<v Speaker 2>longterm metabolite tests and was able </v>

172
00:09:24.451 --> 00:09:28.320
<v Speaker 2>to catch some of this coaches athletes </v>
<v Speaker 2>for using the oral terminable.</v>

173
00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:30.930
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the actual drug itself,</v>

174
00:09:30.931 --> 00:09:33.480
<v Speaker 2>it's gone from the system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the metabolite remains.</v>

175
00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:34.343
<v Speaker 2>Now what is the window that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this metabolite is supposed to be </v>

176
00:09:37.741 --> 00:09:39.870
<v Speaker 2>detectable in the body?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause we're talking now,</v>

177
00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.970
<v Speaker 2>what are we at like 18 months?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here,</v>

178
00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:42.863
<v Speaker 2>here's the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the problem is that initial </v>

179
00:09:43.921 --> 00:09:47.540
<v Speaker 2>ingestion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause my question is these same longterm</v>

180
00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:51.390
<v Speaker 2>metabolites,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these existed a year plus ago.</v>

181
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.210
<v Speaker 2>It was more than a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How long ago that that's the thing.</v>

182
00:09:54.211 --> 00:09:56.940
<v Speaker 2>So July,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2017 was your initial test.</v>

183
00:09:56.941 --> 00:09:57.774
<v Speaker 2>So with all the experts and we'll get </v>
<v Speaker 2>through this with all the experts are </v>

184
00:09:59.761 --> 00:10:00.594
<v Speaker 2>telling us is there is no evidence of re</v>
<v Speaker 2>ingestion and most likely this is still </v>

185
00:10:06.181 --> 00:10:09.480
<v Speaker 2>remnants from the July,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2017 tests.</v>

186
00:10:09.481 --> 00:10:12.260
<v Speaker 2>However it was to enter into a system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

187
00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:13.263
<v Speaker 2>and we'll go through some of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>testing numbers that have shown </v>

188
00:10:15.031 --> 00:10:19.700
<v Speaker 2>negatives followed by very low level </v>
<v Speaker 2>Pika Pika gram quantities.</v>

189
00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:20.533
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was that the ingestion that happened </v>

190
00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:28.790
<v Speaker 2>that he tested positive for in July of </v>
<v Speaker 2>2017 indicated a long term effect.</v>

191
00:10:29.011 --> 00:10:31.130
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a long term term metabolite.</v>

192
00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.033
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So meaning it had already been an </v>

193
00:10:33.391 --> 00:10:36.360
<v Speaker 2>assistant for a year or so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It absolutely could have predated,</v>

194
00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:37.353
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the theory the first time through was </v>

195
00:10:38.701 --> 00:10:39.534
<v Speaker 2>something had to have entered a system </v>
<v Speaker 2>between July 7th and July 8th those </v>

196
00:10:42.571 --> 00:10:47.571
<v Speaker 2>negatives and this low pika gram reading</v>
<v Speaker 2>on July 28th over this last year,</v>

197
00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.090
<v Speaker 2>there's been a lot of study into this </v>
<v Speaker 2>longterm metabolite.</v>

198
00:10:51.091 --> 00:10:53.580
<v Speaker 2>As I mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this isn't just a UFC issue.</v>

199
00:10:53.581 --> 00:10:54.414
<v Speaker 2>There's another major professional </v>
<v Speaker 2>sports league that for the time being </v>

200
00:10:57.361 --> 00:10:59.610
<v Speaker 2>wants to keep their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their testing confidential,</v>

201
00:10:59.611 --> 00:11:02.190
<v Speaker 2>but they've shared that information with</v>
<v Speaker 2>scientists,</v>

202
00:11:02.191 --> 00:11:04.020
<v Speaker 2>with Usada,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with myself.</v>

203
00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:05.243
<v Speaker 2>They saw it on multiple occasions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This pulsing effect over a year where </v>

204
00:11:08.431 --> 00:11:11.310
<v Speaker 2>you'd see this positive tests over a </v>
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>

205
00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:13.170
<v Speaker 2>We're talking two and a half years now.</v>

206
00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:14.220
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's a year,</v>

207
00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:15.241
<v Speaker 2>if they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's a,</v>

208
00:11:15.241 --> 00:11:19.350
<v Speaker 2>if in July he had to ride in the 17th </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you were talking a year and a half,</v>

209
00:11:19.351 --> 00:11:20.460
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>July,</v>

210
00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:21.293
<v Speaker 2>2000 second half.</v>
<v Speaker 2>July 17 but it could have been an </v>

211
00:11:23.791 --> 00:11:25.560
<v Speaker 2>assistant a year prior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

212
00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:26.483
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could have been a couple of months a </v>

213
00:11:27.301 --> 00:11:28.081
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

214
00:11:28.081 --> 00:11:28.914
<v Speaker 2>He had never showed up for that end </v>
<v Speaker 2>three metabolite for he had been tested </v>

215
00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:34.470
<v Speaker 2>for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had been tested multiple times in the</v>

216
00:11:34.471 --> 00:11:38.100
<v Speaker 2>program from wrong isn't the same level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

217
00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:39.083
<v Speaker 2>Approximately the same Pika grams that </v>
<v Speaker 2>exists today in 2018 that were there in </v>

218
00:11:44.791 --> 00:11:49.110
<v Speaker 2>2017 generally if you look in and we can</v>
<v Speaker 2>go over these numbers,</v>

219
00:11:49.111 --> 00:11:50.580
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it fluctuates,</v>

220
00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:52.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from single digits and never gets into a</v>

221
00:11:52.561 --> 00:11:55.090
<v Speaker 2>triple digits to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to mid double digits.</v>

222
00:11:55.091 --> 00:11:58.120
<v Speaker 2>So there's some as low as nine peak of </v>
<v Speaker 2>grams over that time.</v>

223
00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.860
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was some at 60 peak of grants,</v>

224
00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:01.723
<v Speaker 2>however,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a peak grant to someone because it's a </v>

225
00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:05.200
<v Speaker 2>preposterously small.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's insane.</v>

226
00:12:05.201 --> 00:12:06.034
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

227
00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:07.293
<v Speaker 2>the analogy that I heard early on was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think John uses throw a pinch of </v>

228
00:12:10.751 --> 00:12:12.610
<v Speaker 2>salt and Olympic swimming pool and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

229
00:12:12.611 --> 00:12:15.280
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's Kinda wrap your head around.</v>

230
00:12:15.281 --> 00:12:16.114
<v Speaker 2>Now let's go the other side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's talk about something really small </v>

231
00:12:18.251 --> 00:12:19.084
<v Speaker 2>that we know of and how many times you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to break down that small particle </v>

232
00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:25.480
<v Speaker 2>to get to a peak of Graham.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one grain of salt.</v>

233
00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:26.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all know what that looks like,</v>

234
00:12:26.831 --> 00:12:27.664
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You put that in front of you and you </v>

235
00:12:29.321 --> 00:12:31.420
<v Speaker 2>split that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'd mentioned this week,</v>

236
00:12:31.421 --> 00:12:33.910
<v Speaker 2>50 million,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's actually 58 million.</v>

237
00:12:33.911 --> 00:12:36.910
<v Speaker 2>If you split that 58 million times a </v>
<v Speaker 2>grain of salt,</v>

238
00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:38.253
<v Speaker 2>each one has a pika gram.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's incomprehensible the </v>

239
00:12:41.651 --> 00:12:44.560
<v Speaker 2>detection level and how small that is.</v>

240
00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:46.510
<v Speaker 2>It really is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

241
00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:49.480
<v Speaker 2>And how many peak of grams that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>find in his system.</v>

242
00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:51.220
<v Speaker 2>So he's gone from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'll,</v>

243
00:12:51.221 --> 00:12:53.050
<v Speaker 2>I'll read through it here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's,</v>

244
00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:56.500
<v Speaker 2>here's since the initial appearance of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the n three metabolite,</v>

245
00:12:56.530 --> 00:13:00.040
<v Speaker 2>here's what John's tests look like and </v>
<v Speaker 2>those peak gram reading.</v>

246
00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:05.080
<v Speaker 2>So the first one was collection date was</v>
<v Speaker 2>July 28th,</v>

247
00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:09.220
<v Speaker 2>2017 he had a concentration of ADP </v>
<v Speaker 2>grams.</v>

248
00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:10.473
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me caution and I'll read something </v>

249
00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:13.023
<v Speaker 2>from an expert.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you get down to these pika gram </v>

250
00:13:15.191 --> 00:13:16.660
<v Speaker 2>levels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

251
00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:21.100
<v Speaker 2>the science is somewhat inexact because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's such a small amount.</v>

252
00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:23.650
<v Speaker 2>So the variable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the plus or minus,</v>

253
00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:27.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can be anywhere from 2030 I've seen in,</v>

254
00:13:27.031 --> 00:13:28.750
<v Speaker 2>in some instances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>50 or 60.</v>

255
00:13:28.751 --> 00:13:32.170
<v Speaker 2>So what this scientist name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his name is Larry Bowers.</v>

256
00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:33.920
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was formerly the,</v>

257
00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:37.630
<v Speaker 2>the Usada Science director.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's currently retired and independently</v>

258
00:13:37.631 --> 00:13:40.300
<v Speaker 2>consults.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Before that he ran an Olympic,</v>

259
00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:43.390
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Olympic Committee,</v>

260
00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:46.110
<v Speaker 2>a accredited laboratory at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>University of Indiana.</v>

261
00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:50.530
<v Speaker 2>The guy's got 20 to 25 years of </v>
<v Speaker 2>anti-doping experience.</v>

262
00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:52.840
<v Speaker 2>Here's what he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he told me about,</v>

263
00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:54.280
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

264
00:13:54.281 --> 00:13:55.114
<v Speaker 2>when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're analyzing small picogram </v>

265
00:13:57.581 --> 00:14:01.130
<v Speaker 2>levels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although the two lab,</v>

266
00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:05.080
<v Speaker 2>a respective laboratories report a </v>
<v Speaker 2>concentration,</v>

267
00:14:05.081 --> 00:14:08.230
<v Speaker 2>I would caution against becoming too </v>
<v Speaker 2>fixated on the numbers.</v>

268
00:14:08.231 --> 00:14:09.064
<v Speaker 2>First,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the numbers are really estimates of </v>

269
00:14:10.031 --> 00:14:10.864
<v Speaker 2>concentration and probably should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>considered a range of about plus or </v>

270
00:14:13.931 --> 00:14:14.764
<v Speaker 2>minus 20 picograms per ml.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said the December 9th result </v>

271
00:14:18.281 --> 00:14:19.114
<v Speaker 2>would be in the range of John's and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll get to that between 60 and a </v>

272
00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:22.213
<v Speaker 2>hundred second while the adjustment of </v>
<v Speaker 2>concentration by specific gravity </v>

273
00:14:25.571 --> 00:14:28.570
<v Speaker 2>attempts to deal with the variability of</v>
<v Speaker 2>urinary excretion rates,</v>

274
00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:29.613
<v Speaker 2>it is an exact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is inexact and adds variability to </v>

275
00:14:32.651 --> 00:14:34.300
<v Speaker 2>the estimates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Finally,</v>

276
00:14:34.301 --> 00:14:35.134
<v Speaker 2>and most importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>science has no clear understanding of </v>

277
00:14:37.061 --> 00:14:41.350
<v Speaker 2>the variance of urinary excretion of </v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs at ultra trace concentration.</v>

278
00:14:41.351 --> 00:14:43.000
<v Speaker 2>So basically saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

279
00:14:43.001 --> 00:14:43.834
<v Speaker 2>I mean we have a general idea how this </v>
<v Speaker 2>works in science but and I think this </v>

280
00:14:47.621 --> 00:14:48.454
<v Speaker 2>instance comes to play,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be real careful if you're to be the guy </v>

281
00:14:52.011 --> 00:14:54.260
<v Speaker 2>with the pseudoscience out there saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a second,</v>

282
00:14:54.261 --> 00:14:55.094
<v Speaker 2>John jumped from 20 to 60 from September</v>
<v Speaker 2>to December and that means he re </v>

283
00:15:00.701 --> 00:15:01.310
<v Speaker 2>ingested it.</v>

284
00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:04.040
<v Speaker 2>What he's saying here is slow your roll </v>
<v Speaker 2>on that.</v>

285
00:15:04.041 --> 00:15:04.874
<v Speaker 2>That that it's such a small </v>
<v Speaker 2>incomprehensible level that we don't </v>

286
00:15:08.691 --> 00:15:11.000
<v Speaker 2>really know what those variances are </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to look like.</v>

287
00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:12.193
<v Speaker 2>Now I think if we saw jumps and John </v>
<v Speaker 2>from single digit eight or nine peak of </v>

288
00:15:15.141 --> 00:15:18.140
<v Speaker 2>Graham to multiple hundred digit Pika </v>
<v Speaker 2>grams,</v>

289
00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:21.200
<v Speaker 2>there would be a concern and maybe some </v>
<v Speaker 2>meat read administration,</v>

290
00:15:21.201 --> 00:15:26.201
<v Speaker 2>but the experts I've speaking to when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're talking variability of 10 2030 40</v>

291
00:15:26.751 --> 00:15:29.510
<v Speaker 2>it's not that significant at the peak of</v>
<v Speaker 2>gram level.</v>

292
00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:34.490
<v Speaker 2>What is the window where this longterm </v>
<v Speaker 2>metabolites starts to express itself?</v>

293
00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:35.443
<v Speaker 2>Like what you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's short term and there's medium </v>

294
00:15:37.311 --> 00:15:38.720
<v Speaker 2>term.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the long term.</v>

295
00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:42.020
<v Speaker 2>How long does it take before the law?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good question.</v>

296
00:15:42.021 --> 00:15:43.670
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have the answer to that.</v>

297
00:15:43.671 --> 00:15:44.504
<v Speaker 2>And maybe in rich hank hubs report here </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I would encourage those that are at </v>

298
00:15:47.661 --> 00:15:48.441
<v Speaker 2>home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

299
00:15:48.441 --> 00:15:51.860
<v Speaker 2>playing playing scientist at their </v>
<v Speaker 2>computer a,</v>

300
00:15:51.861 --> 00:15:55.280
<v Speaker 2>the journal of steroid biochemistry and </v>
<v Speaker 2>molecular biology.</v>

301
00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:56.443
<v Speaker 2>A Raw Chekhov writes a report detection </v>
<v Speaker 2>and mass spec spectrometric </v>

302
00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:01.963
<v Speaker 2>characterization of novel Longterm </v>
<v Speaker 2>Dehydro Chloro method testosterone </v>

303
00:16:05.631 --> 00:16:06.464
<v Speaker 2>metabolites in human urine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure when that longterm </v>

304
00:16:09.051 --> 00:16:11.060
<v Speaker 2>metabolite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how long it takes to to show up.</v>

305
00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:13.490
<v Speaker 2>Here's the problem though with this </v>
<v Speaker 2>substance.</v>

306
00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:14.713
<v Speaker 2>He did a real brief study.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My understanding is administered it to </v>

307
00:16:17.541 --> 00:16:20.450
<v Speaker 2>himself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the only study that exists.</v>

308
00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:22.423
<v Speaker 2>Oral Terenna Ball,</v>
<v Speaker 2>DH CMT to my understanding is not </v>

309
00:16:25.461 --> 00:16:28.910
<v Speaker 2>approved for use for human consumption </v>
<v Speaker 2>consumption anywhere,</v>

310
00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:30.373
<v Speaker 2>anywhere in any country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can't have clinical trials </v>

311
00:16:33.951 --> 00:16:34.784
<v Speaker 2>ethically in the medical world because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just not legal to give this to </v>

312
00:16:38.271 --> 00:16:40.460
<v Speaker 2>human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

313
00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:41.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

314
00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:43.970
<v Speaker 2>we're already kind of behind the eight </v>
<v Speaker 2>ball here and that,</v>

315
00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:45.253
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as compared to other substances where </v>

316
00:16:46.581 --> 00:16:49.140
<v Speaker 2>you can do clinical trials because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're readily available,</v>

317
00:16:49.141 --> 00:16:52.730
<v Speaker 2>would be a per prescription or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This substance is not,</v>

318
00:16:52.731 --> 00:16:53.564
<v Speaker 2>the substance was created by the East </v>
<v Speaker 2>Germans in the seventies and eighties </v>

319
00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:58.183
<v Speaker 2>and was part of their state sponsored </v>
<v Speaker 2>doping program where they were doping </v>

320
00:17:01.281 --> 00:17:02.030
<v Speaker 2>their athletes.</v>

321
00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:02.863
<v Speaker 2>Can you correct me if I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I believe what I've read is that </v>

322
00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:08.300
<v Speaker 2>this is particularly effective when </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are cutting weight.</v>

323
00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:09.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

324
00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:12.770
<v Speaker 2>is that true or is this just more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about that.</v>

325
00:17:12.771 --> 00:17:16.640
<v Speaker 2>I think some may be confusing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>rentable with oral Terenna Ball.</v>

326
00:17:16.641 --> 00:17:19.100
<v Speaker 2>Two completely different substances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually.</v>

327
00:17:19.101 --> 00:17:20.230
<v Speaker 2>Very important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

328
00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:21.183
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's very different effects on the </v>

329
00:17:22.401 --> 00:17:23.234
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's very different windows in terms </v>

330
00:17:24.561 --> 00:17:27.320
<v Speaker 2>of detection time ex explain that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

331
00:17:27.321 --> 00:17:31.130
<v Speaker 2>You gotta be really careful in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>world of performance enhancing drugs.</v>

332
00:17:31.131 --> 00:17:33.920
<v Speaker 2>There's names that are interchangeable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's different,</v>

333
00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:36.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chemical names where you change a little</v>

334
00:17:36.471 --> 00:17:37.304
<v Speaker 2>bit of that chemical name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could mean mean a completely </v>

335
00:17:39.231 --> 00:17:40.064
<v Speaker 2>different substance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's instances where the chemical </v>

336
00:17:42.201 --> 00:17:44.840
<v Speaker 2>name is different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the substance is actually the same.</v>

337
00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:47.690
<v Speaker 2>So when trying to compare two </v>
<v Speaker 2>substances,</v>

338
00:17:47.691 --> 00:17:50.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make sure if you're at home</v>

339
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:52.260
<v Speaker 3>doing that analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're comparing the right ones.</v>

340
00:17:52.261 --> 00:17:55.830
<v Speaker 3>Straight Terenna ball is different than </v>
<v Speaker 3>oral to rentable.</v>

341
00:17:55.831 --> 00:17:57.390
<v Speaker 3>What is the difference?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

342
00:17:57.450 --> 00:17:57.791
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

343
00:17:57.791 --> 00:17:58.624
<v Speaker 3>I can't tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not as familiar with Toronto ball </v>

344
00:18:00.511 --> 00:18:02.970
<v Speaker 3>other than it's not oral to ball.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

345
00:18:02.971 --> 00:18:05.700
<v Speaker 3>but there is a difference in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the detection window.</v>

346
00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:06.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there would be,</v>

347
00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:07.823
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>different substances create and throw </v>

348
00:18:09.211 --> 00:18:11.430
<v Speaker 3>out different metabolites.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

349
00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:14.440
<v Speaker 3>and different substances have different </v>
<v Speaker 3>detection windows.</v>

350
00:18:14.441 --> 00:18:15.274
<v Speaker 3>So I haven't done my study and research </v>
<v Speaker 3>on straight Terenna ball other than </v>

351
00:18:18.121 --> 00:18:19.980
<v Speaker 3>knowing it's different than the </v>
<v Speaker 3>substance here.</v>

352
00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:20.980
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

353
00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:23.160
<v Speaker 3>Gregory reaching cough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's how you say his last name,</v>

354
00:18:23.161 --> 00:18:23.994
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was the only guy to do an actual </v>

355
00:18:26.821 --> 00:18:28.410
<v Speaker 3>verified study?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>

356
00:18:28.411 --> 00:18:31.050
<v Speaker 3>Now is this study been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it been peer reviewed?</v>

357
00:18:31.051 --> 00:18:31.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it will,</v>

358
00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:35.610
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's published in the Journal of steroid</v>

359
00:18:35.611 --> 00:18:38.790
<v Speaker 3>biochemistry and molecular biology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in order to get something published,</v>

360
00:18:38.791 --> 00:18:40.050
<v Speaker 3>it needs to be peer reviewed.</v>

361
00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:43.170
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has it been replicated anywhere?</v>

362
00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:44.100
<v Speaker 3>Not that I'm aware of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

363
00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:45.960
<v Speaker 3>So it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we have one study,</v>

364
00:18:45.961 --> 00:18:49.380
<v Speaker 3>which is really fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we know that w first of all,</v>

365
00:18:49.381 --> 00:18:51.660
<v Speaker 3>we know this is an effect of steroid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know it works.</v>

366
00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:53.003
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These Germans I think show that they </v>

367
00:18:53.881 --> 00:18:55.650
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't have been using it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

368
00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:56.910
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not a difficult,</v>

369
00:18:56.911 --> 00:18:59.790
<v Speaker 3>it's not an easy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>easy substance to get ahold of.</v>

370
00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:03.060
<v Speaker 3>Look when it's not approved for use </v>
<v Speaker 3>anywhere in the world,</v>

371
00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:05.610
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's only available on the black market.</v>

372
00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:07.890
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you'd probably have to go to China to</v>

373
00:19:07.891 --> 00:19:08.724
<v Speaker 3>get it manufactured or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>research chemical supply company that's </v>

374
00:19:12.511 --> 00:19:14.700
<v Speaker 3>not supposed to be provided to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to humans.</v>

375
00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:15.563
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm certainly not attributing this to </v>

376
00:19:16.141 --> 00:19:19.110
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there were rumors,</v>

377
00:19:19.111 --> 00:19:19.944
<v Speaker 3>this was one discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was that one of the possible ways he </v>

378
00:19:24.391 --> 00:19:25.410
<v Speaker 3>could have ingested this.</v>

379
00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:27.630
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and let's be very kind.</v>

380
00:19:27.631 --> 00:19:29.190
<v Speaker 3>John Likes to party.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

381
00:19:29.191 --> 00:19:30.024
<v Speaker 3>One of the things about partying is </v>
<v Speaker 3>people do cocaine and one of the things </v>

382
00:19:32.281 --> 00:19:35.010
<v Speaker 3>about cocaine is sometimes cocaine is </v>
<v Speaker 3>cut with creatine.</v>

383
00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:38.790
<v Speaker 3>One of the things about creatine is </v>
<v Speaker 3>oftentimes you're buying cheap creatine.</v>

384
00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:40.980
<v Speaker 3>I spent a little,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that we've had with on</v>

385
00:19:40.981 --> 00:19:42.790
<v Speaker 3>it on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's our,</v>

386
00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:44.880
<v Speaker 3>our products are all third party </v>
<v Speaker 3>verified,</v>

387
00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:48.870
<v Speaker 3>but in the initial goings when we tried </v>
<v Speaker 3>different manufacturers,</v>

388
00:19:48.871 --> 00:19:52.680
<v Speaker 3>especially for Alpha brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we found there were other trace elements</v>

389
00:19:52.681 --> 00:19:54.750
<v Speaker 3>that were in Alpha brain that weren't </v>
<v Speaker 3>supposed to be in there.</v>

390
00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:57.750
<v Speaker 3>And it's because of the vats that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>mix these things up with.</v>

391
00:19:58.260 --> 00:19:59.093
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things that we had heard </v>
<v Speaker 3>was that creatine oftentimes is made in </v>

392
00:20:03.301 --> 00:20:06.600
<v Speaker 3>the same place where they might be </v>
<v Speaker 3>making oral Terenna Ball,</v>

393
00:20:06.601 --> 00:20:07.434
<v Speaker 3>they might be making animal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they might be making a bunch of </v>

394
00:20:09.001 --> 00:20:09.834
<v Speaker 3>different things and trace amounts of </v>
<v Speaker 3>this stuff can get into the create team </v>

395
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.260
<v Speaker 3>and they use creatine to cut cocaine </v>
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

396
00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:18.360
<v Speaker 3>is this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is this possible or am I just,</v>

397
00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:19.170
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

398
00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:20.730
<v Speaker 3>it's absolutely a theory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

399
00:20:20.731 --> 00:20:21.151
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

400
00:20:21.151 --> 00:20:23.010
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't sit here and said that happened,</v>

401
00:20:23.011 --> 00:20:25.980
<v Speaker 3>but I will have heard similar things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have heard similar things.</v>

402
00:20:25.981 --> 00:20:29.040
<v Speaker 3>I know for a fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>based on my previous career,</v>

403
00:20:29.041 --> 00:20:32.100
<v Speaker 3>I worked closely with the DEA.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was with the FDA,</v>

404
00:20:32.101 --> 00:20:36.000
<v Speaker 3>I worked cases involving street </v>
<v Speaker 3>distribution of recreational drugs,</v>

405
00:20:36.001 --> 00:20:36.834
<v Speaker 3>including cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know for a fact that creatine is one </v>

406
00:20:39.781 --> 00:20:43.940
<v Speaker 3>of the most common substances that </v>
<v Speaker 3>cocaine is cut with because as a similar</v>

407
00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:45.750
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some more color,</v>

408
00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:47.980
<v Speaker 3>some more feel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So getting back to</v>

409
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:48.813
<v Speaker 2>Mclaren's arbitration decision,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is publicly available </v>

410
00:20:51.791 --> 00:20:53.410
<v Speaker 2>records,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying anything new,</v>

411
00:20:53.411 --> 00:20:58.060
<v Speaker 2>but Mclaren addresses at least John's </v>
<v Speaker 2>lifestyle around this time.</v>

412
00:20:58.061 --> 00:20:58.894
<v Speaker 2>And he says the athlete openly admitted </v>
<v Speaker 2>to Usada that prior to and for a period </v>

413
00:21:02.711 --> 00:21:03.544
<v Speaker 2>of time after the reporting of his </v>
<v Speaker 2>second adverse analytical finding on </v>

414
00:21:06.101 --> 00:21:11.101
<v Speaker 2>July 28 2017 the athlete used illicit so</v>
<v Speaker 2>called street drugs,</v>

415
00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:13.840
<v Speaker 2>including cocaine now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

416
00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:14.980
<v Speaker 2>For me to sit here and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

417
00:21:14.981 --> 00:21:16.960
<v Speaker 2>that's where it came from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that.</v>

418
00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:18.570
<v Speaker 2>What's the time period?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's talking about the,</v>

419
00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:21.030
<v Speaker 2>the athlete admitted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

420
00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:22.803
<v Speaker 2>that prior to and for a period of time </v>
<v Speaker 2>after the reporting of a second adverse </v>

421
00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:30.670
<v Speaker 2>analytical finding on July 27,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2017 admitted.</v>

422
00:21:30.671 --> 00:21:35.050
<v Speaker 2>So before that test and sometime after.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

423
00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:37.650
<v Speaker 2>So does that make sense though?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it,</v>

424
00:21:37.651 --> 00:21:39.720
<v Speaker 2>it's cut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that's what where the,</v>

425
00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:40.593
<v Speaker 2>the source of it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does it make sense that that would show </v>

426
00:21:43.361 --> 00:21:45.640
<v Speaker 2>up as a longterm metabolite?</v>

427
00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:50.670
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't it need a long time in the body </v>
<v Speaker 2>to digest or do we not know enough about</v>

428
00:21:50.831 --> 00:21:53.020
<v Speaker 2>the window of time?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

429
00:21:53.021 --> 00:21:55.390
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if we know enough about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>window of time.</v>

430
00:21:55.391 --> 00:21:56.224
<v Speaker 2>You know my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my theory and looking at it is even if </v>

431
00:21:58.121 --> 00:22:03.121
<v Speaker 2>there's a small amount of the oral </v>
<v Speaker 2>Terenna ball in that it's going to for a</v>

432
00:22:04.361 --> 00:22:05.194
<v Speaker 2>period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>show that parent compound at a small </v>

433
00:22:07.811 --> 00:22:08.644
<v Speaker 2>peak of gram amount and the short and </v>
<v Speaker 2>midterm metabolites in the small peak </v>

434
00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:13.103
<v Speaker 2>gram amount.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have never seen those in the history </v>

435
00:22:15.761 --> 00:22:18.640
<v Speaker 2>of Johns testing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's only this longterm metabolite.</v>

436
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.090
<v Speaker 2>So that may be indication that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>occurred.</v>

437
00:22:22.091 --> 00:22:24.460
<v Speaker 2>Maybe even prior to what we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about here.</v>

438
00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:25.503
<v Speaker 2>Is it something that could be </v>
<v Speaker 2>accentuated in some way by the weight </v>

439
00:22:29.891 --> 00:22:30.724
<v Speaker 2>cutting process?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I absolutely think that could be a </v>

440
00:22:32.801 --> 00:22:34.180
<v Speaker 2>factor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

441
00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:36.820
<v Speaker 2>there are studies not necessarily with </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

442
00:22:36.850 --> 00:22:39.730
<v Speaker 2>but another substance clomiphene and </v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

443
00:22:39.731 --> 00:22:40.564
<v Speaker 2>I want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while I'm cautioning people to be </v>

444
00:22:42.311 --> 00:22:44.740
<v Speaker 2>careful about comparing different </v>
<v Speaker 2>substances,</v>

445
00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:46.143
<v Speaker 2>the commonality between Clomiphene,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which there are multiple clinical </v>

446
00:22:49.451 --> 00:22:50.284
<v Speaker 2>studies on cause it is approved for use </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be distributed to humans and oral </v>

447
00:22:54.041 --> 00:22:56.110
<v Speaker 2>Terenna ball is or both chlorinated.</v>

448
00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:59.770
<v Speaker 2>So they both contain a chlorine atom on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the molecule.</v>

449
00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:05.190
<v Speaker 2>And there is a recently published study </v>
<v Speaker 2>on clomiphene and its excretion rates.</v>

450
00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:08.193
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again for those at home that want to </v>

451
00:23:09.521 --> 00:23:12.160
<v Speaker 2>look it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The study was published in the endocrine</v>

452
00:23:12.161 --> 00:23:14.740
<v Speaker 2>society publication.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pure reviewed,</v>

453
00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:16.053
<v Speaker 2>the name of it is hpt axis affects and </v>
<v Speaker 2>urinary detection following clomiphene </v>

454
00:23:20.111 --> 00:23:24.220
<v Speaker 2>administration and males.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what they did is they basically,</v>

455
00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:25.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got a group of males,</v>

456
00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:28.630
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gave them a one month,</v>

457
00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:31.000
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cycle of clomiphene,</v>

458
00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:31.983
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think 25 milligrams a day and then </v>

459
00:23:34.211 --> 00:23:35.044
<v Speaker 2>have them get off and then continue to </v>
<v Speaker 2>look at their year and up to 261 days </v>

460
00:23:39.821 --> 00:23:40.654
<v Speaker 2>after.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what you saw and what you see in </v>

461
00:23:42.431 --> 00:23:46.040
<v Speaker 2>this study is that pulsing effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

462
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:46.903
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking at some of the studies </v>

463
00:23:47.461 --> 00:23:49.150
<v Speaker 2>subjects here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

464
00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:50.113
<v Speaker 2>subject one on day one 21 still showed </v>
<v Speaker 2>147 Pika grams of clomiphene day one 28 </v>

465
00:23:57.170 --> 00:23:59.470
<v Speaker 2>showed 174 pika grams.</v>

466
00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:04.770
<v Speaker 2>Day One 35 shows nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's below the minimum courting,</v>

467
00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:06.050
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reporting limit.</v>

468
00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:09.950
<v Speaker 2>And then day one 49,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's back up to two 36.</v>

469
00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:12.350
<v Speaker 2>There are one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>

470
00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:13.700
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four,</v>

471
00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:14.773
<v Speaker 2>five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six out of I think 12 subjects in that </v>

472
00:24:18.021 --> 00:24:18.854
<v Speaker 2>study that showed this pulsing effect of</v>
<v Speaker 2>this chlorinated substance coming and </v>

473
00:24:23.601 --> 00:24:25.430
<v Speaker 2>going again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

474
00:24:25.431 --> 00:24:27.500
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's different than oral Terenna Ball,</v>

475
00:24:27.501 --> 00:24:32.150
<v Speaker 2>but it has that common factor of being </v>
<v Speaker 2>chlorinated in this study.</v>

476
00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:34.030
<v Speaker 2>They do talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

477
00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:34.873
<v Speaker 2>a fat tissue called the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me look this up and make sure I got </v>

478
00:24:38.121 --> 00:24:39.590
<v Speaker 2>this right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Adipose tissue,</v>

479
00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:42.860
<v Speaker 2>this is fat that surrounds the internal </v>
<v Speaker 2>organs.</v>

480
00:24:42.861 --> 00:24:45.710
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the last things that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>body burns when it's going,</v>

481
00:24:45.711 --> 00:24:47.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>starving itself and going to fat.</v>

482
00:24:47.571 --> 00:24:49.700
<v Speaker 2>It protects those organs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

483
00:24:49.701 --> 00:24:51.790
<v Speaker 2>you look at these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

484
00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:55.400
<v Speaker 2>extreme weight gains and cuts that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>UFC athlete goes through.</v>

485
00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:56.233
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you're going to find </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibly another human subject anywhere </v>

486
00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:04.460
<v Speaker 2>that goes through putting weight on </v>
<v Speaker 2>other than maybe that,</v>

487
00:25:04.461 --> 00:25:07.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't think Olympic wrestling matches </v>
<v Speaker 2>with an MMA fighter,</v>

488
00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:09.230
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>goes through,</v>

489
00:25:09.231 --> 00:25:10.064
<v Speaker 2>at least in my experience over these </v>
<v Speaker 2>three or four years talking to those in </v>

490
00:25:12.531 --> 00:25:15.640
<v Speaker 2>the Olympic world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're at the extreme and it's,</v>

491
00:25:15.641 --> 00:25:17.630
<v Speaker 2>it's something obviously we've talked </v>
<v Speaker 2>about before,</v>

492
00:25:17.631 --> 00:25:19.940
<v Speaker 2>we're trying to curtail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

493
00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:20.863
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's clearly never been a study for </v>

494
00:25:22.611 --> 00:25:23.444
<v Speaker 2>anybody who dehydrates and readwrite </v>
<v Speaker 2>hydrates themselves to the extent that </v>

495
00:25:27.321 --> 00:25:29.540
<v Speaker 2>some of our athletes do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could never find,</v>

496
00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:30.763
<v Speaker 2>there would never be anybody with any </v>
<v Speaker 2>ethics that would support a study </v>

497
00:25:33.261 --> 00:25:37.250
<v Speaker 2>because some of that dehydration exceeds</v>
<v Speaker 2>World Health Organization standards.</v>

498
00:25:37.251 --> 00:25:39.770
<v Speaker 2>So there's no studies out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

499
00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:41.690
<v Speaker 2>on this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But clearly,</v>

500
00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:43.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking from afar I,</v>

501
00:25:43.081 --> 00:25:43.914
<v Speaker 2>I'd say that it likely has some impact </v>
<v Speaker 2>over what's being released by this </v>

502
00:25:46.941 --> 00:25:47.960
<v Speaker 2>adipose tissue.</v>

503
00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:50.330
<v Speaker 2>We should certainly talk about that in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the future,</v>

504
00:25:50.331 --> 00:25:51.950
<v Speaker 2>about the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the weight cutting aspect of it.</v>

505
00:25:51.951 --> 00:25:52.784
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this adipose tissue loss at extreme </v>

506
00:25:55.791 --> 00:25:56.624
<v Speaker 2>weight cuts could potentially be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason why this stuff is excluding </v>

507
00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:01.301
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

508
00:26:01.301 --> 00:26:04.100
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely a theory out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about micro dosing?</v>

509
00:26:04.550 --> 00:26:05.383
<v Speaker 2>So here's the thing with microdosing </v>
<v Speaker 2>microdosing has done with indogenous </v>

510
00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:11.810
<v Speaker 2>substances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So only test,</v>

511
00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:13.183
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean someone could try it with </v>

512
00:26:13.881 --> 00:26:14.714
<v Speaker 2>something else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the reason you microdose with </v>

513
00:26:16.941 --> 00:26:20.180
<v Speaker 2>endogenous substances is there already </v>
<v Speaker 2>produced in the body,</v>

514
00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:21.800
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the theory of,</v>

515
00:26:21.801 --> 00:26:22.634
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to microdose oral Terenna </v>

516
00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:25.033
<v Speaker 2>Ball,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll oral Terenna ball still producing </v>

517
00:26:26.691 --> 00:26:30.950
<v Speaker 2>these short term and longterm </v>
<v Speaker 2>metabolites in theory,</v>

518
00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:31.813
<v Speaker 2>whether you're taking a hundred </v>
<v Speaker 2>milligrams or one milligram of oral </v>

519
00:26:35.871 --> 00:26:36.704
<v Speaker 2>Terenna Ball,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those excretion rates of those </v>

520
00:26:38.961 --> 00:26:40.910
<v Speaker 2>metabolites are still going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>consistent.</v>

521
00:26:40.911 --> 00:26:44.550
<v Speaker 2>They're going to be in a much smaller </v>
<v Speaker 2>level or a way to those excretion rates.</v>

522
00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:48.090
<v Speaker 2>Is there a way to mask that in some way?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not aware of any,</v>

523
00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:50.490
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

524
00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:53.160
<v Speaker 2>The only study we have is Gregory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>correct?</v>

525
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:54.150
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

526
00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:55.403
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just taking it from a common sense </v>

527
00:26:56.791 --> 00:26:58.830
<v Speaker 2>approach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's certainly,</v>

528
00:26:58.860 --> 00:26:59.693
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those that know about micro grossing </v>

529
00:27:00.961 --> 00:27:03.750
<v Speaker 2>know that you microdose with endogenous </v>
<v Speaker 2>substances,</v>

530
00:27:03.751 --> 00:27:04.584
<v Speaker 2>things that are already pouring in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>body so your body knows what to do with </v>

531
00:27:06.871 --> 00:27:07.890
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those what to do.</v>

532
00:27:07.891 --> 00:27:09.300
<v Speaker 2>And you're fooling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

533
00:27:09.301 --> 00:27:13.200
<v Speaker 2>not only are these metabolizing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no metabolites of them,</v>

534
00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:16.200
<v Speaker 2>but you could also be fooling the </v>
<v Speaker 2>biological passport.</v>

535
00:27:16.201 --> 00:27:19.260
<v Speaker 2>That's the concern I think and why </v>
<v Speaker 2>people microdose.</v>

536
00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:23.130
<v Speaker 2>So you saw it as looking not only </v>
<v Speaker 2>testing for specific substances,</v>

537
00:27:23.131 --> 00:27:27.060
<v Speaker 2>but our testosterone epitestosterone </v>
<v Speaker 2>ratio is going up.</v>

538
00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:30.930
<v Speaker 2>They're looking at at blood values,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many young red blood cells,</v>

539
00:27:30.931 --> 00:27:32.610
<v Speaker 2>how many mature red blood cells.</v>

540
00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:33.443
<v Speaker 2>So microdosing and those two areas </v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't set off alarms in the </v>

541
00:27:36.481 --> 00:27:38.820
<v Speaker 2>biological passport world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

542
00:27:38.821 --> 00:27:39.654
<v Speaker 2>I've never heard personally of </v>
<v Speaker 2>microdosing of exotic his substances </v>

543
00:27:42.901 --> 00:27:43.734
<v Speaker 2>that are not found in the body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Microdosing and my understanding has </v>

544
00:27:46.551 --> 00:27:47.384
<v Speaker 2>done with things that are endogenous </v>
<v Speaker 2>body for people that are not familiar </v>

545
00:27:51.001 --> 00:27:51.834
<v Speaker 2>with this terminology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were just talking about microdosing </v>

546
00:27:53.610 --> 00:27:54.443
<v Speaker 2>performance enhancing drugs because a </v>
<v Speaker 2>micro dosing in today's world is a very </v>

547
00:27:58.801 --> 00:28:01.430
<v Speaker 2>common thing with mushrooms and Lsd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of,</v>

548
00:28:01.790 --> 00:28:03.350
<v Speaker 2>I mean I saw a ton of microdosing in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

549
00:28:03.351 --> 00:28:06.350
<v Speaker 2>in the cycling world that was test </v>
<v Speaker 2>towels,</v>

550
00:28:06.370 --> 00:28:08.220
<v Speaker 2>testosterone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>epo,</v>

551
00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:09.233
<v Speaker 2>hgh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all those natural occurring in the body </v>

552
00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:12.193
<v Speaker 2>and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't produce any really a red flag </v>

553
00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:17.520
<v Speaker 2>metabolites if you do them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At very,</v>

554
00:28:17.521 --> 00:28:18.840
<v Speaker 2>very small levels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll,</v>

555
00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:19.703
<v Speaker 2>the parent will clear quickly not </v>
<v Speaker 2>produce any metabolites and will not </v>

556
00:28:22.561 --> 00:28:24.780
<v Speaker 2>throw off the biological passport </v>
<v Speaker 2>analysis.</v>

557
00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:26.093
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there a what you mean when Victor </v>

558
00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:32.140
<v Speaker 2>Conte came out with a clear and all that</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff with ball co,</v>

559
00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:34.470
<v Speaker 2>they were fooling people.</v>

560
00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:35.370
<v Speaker 2>Is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it,</v>

561
00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:36.233
<v Speaker 2>I mean one of the things that we've </v>
<v Speaker 2>talked about before is that it's a </v>

562
00:28:38.341 --> 00:28:41.970
<v Speaker 2>constant race to try to keep up with </v>
<v Speaker 2>more advanced cheaters.</v>

563
00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:43.221
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

564
00:28:43.221 --> 00:28:45.000
<v Speaker 2>and you know what's interesting in this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

565
00:28:45.030 --> 00:28:48.210
<v Speaker 2>if I were to talk to you and maybe the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first time we did talk a couple of years</v>

566
00:28:48.211 --> 00:28:48.831
<v Speaker 2>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

567
00:28:48.831 --> 00:28:50.250
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's come a long way from them,</v>

568
00:28:50.251 --> 00:28:52.590
<v Speaker 2>but clearly if I would have talked to </v>
<v Speaker 2>you 15,</v>

569
00:28:52.591 --> 00:28:53.424
<v Speaker 2>16,</v>
<v Speaker 2>17 years ago when I got my start in the </v>

570
00:28:55.171 --> 00:28:56.004
<v Speaker 2>anti-doping world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have told you definitively the </v>

571
00:28:58.711 --> 00:29:00.600
<v Speaker 2>testing is way behind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

572
00:29:00.601 --> 00:29:02.800
<v Speaker 2>what's being used out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

573
00:29:02.850 --> 00:29:06.240
<v Speaker 2>they were testing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>able to test to multiple nanogram,</v>

574
00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:07.470
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>limits.</v>

575
00:29:07.471 --> 00:29:08.304
<v Speaker 2>That's as far down as we can go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now they can go down to single digit </v>

576
00:29:11.551 --> 00:29:12.384
<v Speaker 2>Pika,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gram.</v>

577
00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:16.260
<v Speaker 2>There's another professional sports </v>
<v Speaker 2>league out there that recently had a one</v>

578
00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:19.080
<v Speaker 2>pika gram and three metabolite case.</v>

579
00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:22.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean do the math coming down from you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

580
00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:23.933
<v Speaker 2>four or five nanograms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which used to be the lower limit now to </v>

581
00:29:26.341 --> 00:29:29.940
<v Speaker 2>one Pika Gram ten thousand twenty </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousand times.</v>

582
00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:30.863
<v Speaker 2>I am almost under the theory that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pendulum has swung maybe a little bit </v>

583
00:29:35.401 --> 00:29:36.234
<v Speaker 2>too far in the other direction and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that certainly is part of my job to the </v>

584
00:29:39.991 --> 00:29:40.771
<v Speaker 2>UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

585
00:29:40.771 --> 00:29:43.720
<v Speaker 2>I want catch every intentional cheater </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's out there.</v>

586
00:29:43.721 --> 00:29:46.000
<v Speaker 2>I want to make sure we have a rock solid</v>
<v Speaker 2>program,</v>

587
00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:48.970
<v Speaker 2>use all the latest and greatest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

588
00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:50.980
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>techniques to do it.</v>

589
00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:51.843
<v Speaker 2>But I also want to keep an eye on it to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make sure it's being administrated </v>

590
00:29:54.851 --> 00:29:55.684
<v Speaker 2>fairly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you're getting down to </v>

591
00:29:57.170 --> 00:29:58.870
<v Speaker 2>detection of one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

592
00:29:58.871 --> 00:30:03.871
<v Speaker 2>single digit Pika Grams,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a concern that what kind of level</v>

593
00:30:03.881 --> 00:30:07.300
<v Speaker 2>of sensitivity we're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are we going to talk about environmental</v>

594
00:30:07.301 --> 00:30:08.134
<v Speaker 2>contamination where you walk through a </v>
<v Speaker 2>room and somebody has just opened a </v>

595
00:30:11.861 --> 00:30:13.480
<v Speaker 2>container of something and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

596
00:30:13.481 --> 00:30:15.550
<v Speaker 2>minuscule powders in the air.</v>

597
00:30:15.850 --> 00:30:16.683
<v Speaker 2>There are documented cases that some of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the regularly prescribed prescription </v>

598
00:30:19.721 --> 00:30:20.554
<v Speaker 2>drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>specifically diuretics are getting in </v>

599
00:30:23.771 --> 00:30:26.260
<v Speaker 2>water supplies in some areas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

600
00:30:26.261 --> 00:30:30.520
<v Speaker 2>you get a lot of old people on them that</v>
<v Speaker 2>flushed their old pills down the toilet.</v>

601
00:30:30.850 --> 00:30:31.683
<v Speaker 2>There's documented cases of it getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the water supply and being </v>

602
00:30:34.871 --> 00:30:39.070
<v Speaker 2>detectable at that peak at ground level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you've gotta be really,</v>

603
00:30:39.071 --> 00:30:40.930
<v Speaker 2>really careful about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>

604
00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:42.153
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this case exemplifies that you saw it </v>

605
00:30:44.610 --> 00:30:45.443
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and really the world antidoping agency </v>

606
00:30:47.381 --> 00:30:50.830
<v Speaker 2>world and community are aware of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

607
00:30:50.831 --> 00:30:51.664
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with greater sensitivity and testing in </v>

608
00:30:53.831 --> 00:30:55.300
<v Speaker 2>my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>

609
00:30:55.570 --> 00:31:00.570
<v Speaker 2>makes greater responsibility to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>objective and look fairly at what really</v>

610
00:31:00.641 --> 00:31:03.220
<v Speaker 2>we're doing here when we're detecting </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that small amount.</v>

611
00:31:03.610 --> 00:31:04.443
<v Speaker 2>But this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this task of John's where he's testing </v>

612
00:31:07.901 --> 00:31:08.734
<v Speaker 2>for the same level of peak of Graham's </v>
<v Speaker 2>today as he was in July of 2017 is it </v>

613
00:31:15.341 --> 00:31:17.410
<v Speaker 2>safe to say that this is unprecedented?</v>

614
00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:19.533
<v Speaker 2>Repeat that again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that John's test for the same levels of </v>

615
00:31:23.201 --> 00:31:24.034
<v Speaker 2>peak of grams of these metabolites in </v>
<v Speaker 2>2018 that he was testing for in 2017 </v>

616
00:31:29.870 --> 00:31:31.570
<v Speaker 2>this is unprecedented.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

617
00:31:31.571 --> 00:31:32.404
<v Speaker 2>If the answer's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so maybe I'm precedent and in the </v>

618
00:31:34.151 --> 00:31:34.984
<v Speaker 2>UFC program,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what the United States anti-doping </v>

619
00:31:37.741 --> 00:31:38.574
<v Speaker 2>agency did over these last five or six </v>
<v Speaker 2>months as they reached out to the </v>

620
00:31:42.041 --> 00:31:45.010
<v Speaker 2>science community outside the scope of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the UFC,</v>

621
00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:48.040
<v Speaker 2>they reached out to other professional </v>
<v Speaker 2>sports organizations.</v>

622
00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:49.173
<v Speaker 2>They reached out to otherwise water </v>
<v Speaker 2>laboratories and what they were seeing </v>

623
00:31:52.390 --> 00:31:53.223
<v Speaker 2>was multiple instances of this pulsing </v>
<v Speaker 2>effect where over time you would see a </v>

624
00:31:58.031 --> 00:31:58.864
<v Speaker 2>reading,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the next test it would go away and the </v>

625
00:32:01.301 --> 00:32:05.440
<v Speaker 2>next time you'd see that reading again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe back up to or even above this much</v>

626
00:32:05.441 --> 00:32:07.450
<v Speaker 2>time was correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

627
00:32:07.451 --> 00:32:10.690
<v Speaker 2>So you see that in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the clomiphene study here too,</v>

628
00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:13.270
<v Speaker 2>I mean almost 260 they stopped the </v>
<v Speaker 2>study,</v>

629
00:32:13.271 --> 00:32:14.104
<v Speaker 2>what it was still appearing and Pika </v>
<v Speaker 2>gram levels in some subjects and they </v>

630
00:32:17.471 --> 00:32:19.840
<v Speaker 2>stopped the study at 261 days.</v>

631
00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:22.580
<v Speaker 2>And you see those numbers I was reading </v>
<v Speaker 2>to you.</v>

632
00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:23.433
<v Speaker 2>See this one subject at one 74,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's negative the next time and then he </v>

633
00:32:27.311 --> 00:32:29.770
<v Speaker 2>pops up to two in the two hundreds </v>
<v Speaker 2>after.</v>

634
00:32:29.771 --> 00:32:32.350
<v Speaker 2>So it's actually more than the time </v>
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>

635
00:32:32.351 --> 00:32:33.790
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>apples and oranges,</v>

636
00:32:33.791 --> 00:32:34.624
<v Speaker 2>different substances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the commonality here is chlorinated </v>

637
00:32:37.001 --> 00:32:39.270
<v Speaker 2>substance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So is the,</v>

638
00:32:39.271 --> 00:32:40.104
<v Speaker 2>is it safe to say that this is an </v>
<v Speaker 2>emerging science and that we're still </v>

639
00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:47.480
<v Speaker 2>learning and understanding this as we go</v>
<v Speaker 2>along?</v>

640
00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:49.640
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's still very young.</v>

641
00:32:49.641 --> 00:32:50.570
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first,</v>

642
00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:51.433
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles were </v>

643
00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:57.650
<v Speaker 2>established the first drug testing </v>
<v Speaker 2>laboratory by Doctor Catlin.</v>

644
00:32:58.160 --> 00:32:59.540
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so really,</v>

645
00:32:59.541 --> 00:33:00.374
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the scope of science going back to </v>

646
00:33:01.821 --> 00:33:04.160
<v Speaker 2>the earliest days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then are talking about,</v>

647
00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:05.023
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

648
00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:06.800
<v Speaker 2>30,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30 years,</v>

649
00:33:06.890 --> 00:33:08.210
<v Speaker 2>30,</v>
<v Speaker 2>35 years.</v>

650
00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:09.740
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

651
00:33:09.770 --> 00:33:12.260
<v Speaker 2>when I started off in this 16 or 17 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>

652
00:33:12.261 --> 00:33:13.940
<v Speaker 2>the science still wasn't good.</v>

653
00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:16.640
<v Speaker 2>They were unable to detect anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the peak of gram level,</v>

654
00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:19.580
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again for reference,</v>

655
00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:20.780
<v Speaker 2>very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>

656
00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:24.260
<v Speaker 2>the Wada,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world anti-doping agencies accredits</v>

657
00:33:24.261 --> 00:33:25.094
<v Speaker 2>laboratories across the world and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>have certain standards that those </v>

658
00:33:28.611 --> 00:33:29.444
<v Speaker 2>laboratories must meet or to retain that</v>
<v Speaker 2>accreditation and keep that </v>

659
00:33:34.101 --> 00:33:37.520
<v Speaker 2>accreditation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they have a technical document called</v>

660
00:33:37.521 --> 00:33:40.790
<v Speaker 2>the minimum required performance levels </v>
<v Speaker 2>of their laboratory.</v>

661
00:33:40.791 --> 00:33:45.500
<v Speaker 2>So would they tell the laboratories is </v>
<v Speaker 2>you must detect these substances down to</v>

662
00:33:45.501 --> 00:33:46.334
<v Speaker 2>this amount.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you can't get them down to this </v>

663
00:33:47.871 --> 00:33:48.704
<v Speaker 2>amount,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can't have an accreditation </v>

664
00:33:50.091 --> 00:33:50.924
<v Speaker 2>from water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the class of substances that oral </v>

665
00:33:54.831 --> 00:33:56.970
<v Speaker 2>Terenna ball would be in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

666
00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:58.183
<v Speaker 2>which would be other anabolic agents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the required minimum level that they </v>

667
00:34:04.791 --> 00:34:08.810
<v Speaker 2>must attack two is only two nanograms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So look,</v>

668
00:34:08.811 --> 00:34:09.830
<v Speaker 2>watch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it even says,</v>

669
00:34:09.831 --> 00:34:13.130
<v Speaker 2>as long as you can get to two nanograms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can retain our accreditation.</v>

670
00:34:13.130 --> 00:34:15.920
<v Speaker 2>Well what's happening is an arms race in</v>
<v Speaker 2>these laboratories,</v>

671
00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:17.113
<v Speaker 2>they're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well two's the minimum standard but I </v>

672
00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:21.410
<v Speaker 2>can get down further.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

673
00:34:21.411 --> 00:34:23.840
<v Speaker 2>these are private entities that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

674
00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:26.930
<v Speaker 2>are looking for customers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to be able to reach out and say,</v>

675
00:34:26.931 --> 00:34:30.320
<v Speaker 2>well even though a lot of tells us too </v>
<v Speaker 2>is as low as we need to go,</v>

676
00:34:30.321 --> 00:34:34.640
<v Speaker 2>we can go down to one pika gram.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in a sense,</v>

677
00:34:34.641 --> 00:34:36.740
<v Speaker 2>maybe you need to slow the reigns on </v>
<v Speaker 2>that a little bit.</v>

678
00:34:36.741 --> 00:34:37.574
<v Speaker 2>That we're getting too far and too </v>
<v Speaker 2>sensitive of a level of detection when </v>

679
00:34:41.331 --> 00:34:42.164
<v Speaker 2>it comes to implementing a fair program </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you can't determine where a one </v>

680
00:34:46.821 --> 00:34:49.430
<v Speaker 2>pika gram co came from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could be breathing again,</v>

681
00:34:49.431 --> 00:34:52.760
<v Speaker 2>contaminated air,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drinking contaminated water.</v>

682
00:34:52.761 --> 00:34:55.010
<v Speaker 2>It gets real dangerous when you get down</v>
<v Speaker 2>that low.</v>

683
00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:58.850
<v Speaker 2>Now how does this reflect on past </v>
<v Speaker 2>suspensions?</v>

684
00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:01.760
<v Speaker 2>This is a what when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you deal with something like,</v>

685
00:35:01.761 --> 00:35:03.770
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's bring up Frank Mir for example.</v>

686
00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:07.220
<v Speaker 2>Didn't frank near also test for oral,</v>
<v Speaker 2>turn the ball.</v>

687
00:35:07.221 --> 00:35:08.054
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to get back to Frank Mir but </v>

688
00:35:08.961 --> 00:35:09.794
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's go back to John and this instance </v>

689
00:35:11.661 --> 00:35:13.580
<v Speaker 2>and why you saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has come out and said,</v>

690
00:35:13.581 --> 00:35:15.830
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not a violation.</v>

691
00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:19.310
<v Speaker 2>So if you go to the Wada,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world anti-doping code,</v>

692
00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:22.430
<v Speaker 2>there's a section 10.7</v>
<v Speaker 2>0.4</v>

693
00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:25.160
<v Speaker 2>0.1</v>
<v Speaker 2>are UFC program.</v>

694
00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:26.113
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically mirrors that and we're </v>

695
00:35:28.401 --> 00:35:29.234
<v Speaker 2>bringing that up on the screen there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for purposes of imposing sanctions </v>

696
00:35:32.481 --> 00:35:36.920
<v Speaker 2>under tab 10.7</v>
<v Speaker 2>and anti doping rule violation will only</v>

697
00:35:36.921 --> 00:35:38.010
<v Speaker 2>be a second</v>

698
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:38.843
<v Speaker 3>violation if the anti-doping </v>
<v Speaker 3>organization can establish the athlete </v>

699
00:35:41.881 --> 00:35:42.714
<v Speaker 3>or other person committed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The second anti-doping rule violation </v>

700
00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:46.193
<v Speaker 3>after the athlete or other person </v>
<v Speaker 3>received notice pursuant to article </v>

701
00:35:49.171 --> 00:35:50.004
<v Speaker 3>seven et Cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what's known as a double </v>

702
00:35:52.111 --> 00:35:56.670
<v Speaker 3>jeopardy clause.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The sanction test positive for something</v>

703
00:35:56.671 --> 00:35:57.504
<v Speaker 3>and if he's test positive for the exact </v>
<v Speaker 3>same substance that is still in his </v>

704
00:36:00.781 --> 00:36:03.960
<v Speaker 3>system a year later or whatever the </v>
<v Speaker 3>amount of time is,</v>

705
00:36:03.961 --> 00:36:06.600
<v Speaker 3>you don't include that as a new positive</v>
<v Speaker 3>tasks.</v>

706
00:36:06.601 --> 00:36:07.434
<v Speaker 3>One more thing has to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Science has to determine that there </v>

707
00:36:09.781 --> 00:36:14.670
<v Speaker 3>hasn't been a real administration so </v>
<v Speaker 3>test positive for the same substance and</v>

708
00:36:14.671 --> 00:36:17.310
<v Speaker 3>science says based on all the numbers we</v>
<v Speaker 3>see,</v>

709
00:36:17.470 --> 00:36:18.303
<v Speaker 3>there is no evidence of any readminister</v>
<v Speaker 3>ration and the non evidence of the </v>

710
00:36:21.841 --> 00:36:26.290
<v Speaker 3>readministered nation is the lack of </v>
<v Speaker 3>short term and medium term singling.</v>

711
00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:27.473
<v Speaker 3>Never ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And John's or an issue though that this </v>

712
00:36:29.821 --> 00:36:30.654
<v Speaker 3>is only one test that gregory would </v>
<v Speaker 3>shank goes test is the only study that </v>

713
00:36:34.201 --> 00:36:39.201
<v Speaker 3>showed at these medium and short term </v>
<v Speaker 3>metabolites exist.</v>

714
00:36:39.930 --> 00:36:40.763
<v Speaker 3>It's the only study,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think then if there's only one </v>

715
00:36:42.841 --> 00:36:45.000
<v Speaker 3>study,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to go to anecdotal evidence.</v>

716
00:36:45.001 --> 00:36:48.150
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why don't we do studies on UFC employees</v>

717
00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:52.170
<v Speaker 3>because we're all Toronto Ball.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'll do it.</v>

718
00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:54.023
<v Speaker 3>Oral Terenna ball is illegal to </v>
<v Speaker 3>distribute what's due to Mexico and any </v>

719
00:36:57.841 --> 00:36:59.540
<v Speaker 3>country throughout the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really eagle.</v>

720
00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:01.333
<v Speaker 3>Every contracts go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just let you do whatever you want </v>

721
00:37:02.371 --> 00:37:03.120
<v Speaker 3>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

722
00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:06.180
<v Speaker 3>maybe we can look into that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but shelby may be out for that.</v>

723
00:37:06.181 --> 00:37:08.160
<v Speaker 3>And that's the reason for living there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

724
00:37:08.450 --> 00:37:11.790
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a problem with that in that we're</v>

725
00:37:11.791 --> 00:37:15.860
<v Speaker 3>relying on one study.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This seems to me to be like a,</v>

726
00:37:15.861 --> 00:37:18.630
<v Speaker 3>a critical thing that could affect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we're,</v>

727
00:37:18.631 --> 00:37:19.230
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

728
00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:21.720
<v Speaker 3>we're hoping and we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

729
00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:22.583
<v Speaker 3>we're putting faith in this study that </v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the only way that these </v>

730
00:37:25.051 --> 00:37:28.650
<v Speaker 3>metabolites express themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it possible that,</v>

731
00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:31.830
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that these be like,</v>

732
00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:32.693
<v Speaker 3>you see what the pulsing effect that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>see positive effects and negative or </v>

733
00:37:36.361 --> 00:37:37.194
<v Speaker 3>positive results and negative results </v>
<v Speaker 3>that these short term and medium term </v>

734
00:37:41.791 --> 00:37:42.624
<v Speaker 3>metabolites don't always express </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves and that what we're </v>

735
00:37:44.701 --> 00:37:48.750
<v Speaker 3>considering a longterm metabolite could </v>
<v Speaker 3>in fact just be a metabolite.</v>

736
00:37:49.530 --> 00:37:50.131
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

737
00:37:50.131 --> 00:37:51.570
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess it's possible,</v>

738
00:37:51.571 --> 00:37:52.404
<v Speaker 3>but what are you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you going to sanction and athlete </v>

739
00:37:53.521 --> 00:37:56.820
<v Speaker 3>again because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>potentially it's possible.</v>

740
00:37:56.821 --> 00:37:59.400
<v Speaker 3>And then the theory of that universe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't do that.</v>

741
00:37:59.401 --> 00:38:01.050
<v Speaker 3>Let me read it to you real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

742
00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:04.800
<v Speaker 3>what these experts came out at and terms</v>
<v Speaker 3>of readministered ration.</v>

743
00:38:04.801 --> 00:38:09.000
<v Speaker 3>So Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Daniel Eichner runs the Salt Lake City.</v>

744
00:38:09.001 --> 00:38:12.240
<v Speaker 3>It's called a smart sports medicine </v>
<v Speaker 3>research testing laboratory,</v>

745
00:38:12.241 --> 00:38:13.074
<v Speaker 3>or smurter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're one of two water accredited </v>

746
00:38:14.731 --> 00:38:17.670
<v Speaker 3>laboratories in the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other one being a ucla,</v>

747
00:38:18.190 --> 00:38:19.140
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

748
00:38:19.141 --> 00:38:23.490
<v Speaker 3>one of the most respected minds in </v>
<v Speaker 3>anti-doping phd chemist.</v>

749
00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:24.773
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his answer in terms of readminister </v>

750
00:38:28.381 --> 00:38:29.730
<v Speaker 3>ration,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

751
00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:30.593
<v Speaker 3>was this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you very rarely see scientists at </v>

752
00:38:32.311 --> 00:38:36.190
<v Speaker 3>his level talk in a absolute absolute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there you go.</v>

753
00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:37.473
<v Speaker 2>And here he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is no evidence that Dh cmt has </v>

754
00:38:41.111 --> 00:38:43.690
<v Speaker 2>been readministered that's in writing to</v>
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>

755
00:38:43.691 --> 00:38:45.400
<v Speaker 2>So very definitive on that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

756
00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:48.550
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you saw it as science director now,</v>

757
00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:52.090
<v Speaker 2>Dan Daniels independent even of Usada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So those who criticize,</v>

758
00:38:52.091 --> 00:38:54.280
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you saw it as in bed with the UFC.</v>

759
00:38:54.610 --> 00:38:56.410
<v Speaker 2>Daniel lackner doesn't work for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Soda.</v>

760
00:38:56.470 --> 00:39:00.460
<v Speaker 2>He runs an independent laboratory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You sought to send samples there.</v>

761
00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:03.520
<v Speaker 2>The NFL send samples,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're major league baseball,</v>

762
00:39:03.521 --> 00:39:05.530
<v Speaker 2>send samples there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The NCA,</v>

763
00:39:05.890 --> 00:39:08.230
<v Speaker 2>he's independent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>owns his own laboratory.</v>

764
00:39:09.010 --> 00:39:10.990
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you saw to also put out,</v>

765
00:39:11.110 --> 00:39:13.360
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a letter to us in,</v>

766
00:39:13.370 --> 00:39:15.010
<v Speaker 2>in writing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

767
00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:19.690
<v Speaker 2>upon careful consideration of the very </v>
<v Speaker 2>low concentration of the DH cmt longterm</v>

768
00:39:19.691 --> 00:39:20.940
<v Speaker 2>metabolite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Mr.</v>

769
00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:25.510
<v Speaker 2>Jones is sample and taking into account </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Human Pharma kinetic characteristics</v>

770
00:39:25.511 --> 00:39:28.150
<v Speaker 2>of this particular longterm anabolic </v>
<v Speaker 2>steroid metabolites,</v>

771
00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:30.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>based on data to which you saw to,</v>

772
00:39:30.601 --> 00:39:34.540
<v Speaker 2>has access to and in consult,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in consultation with scientific experts,</v>

773
00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:37.330
<v Speaker 2>some of whose opinions aren't close,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you sought.</v>

774
00:39:37.330 --> 00:39:40.630
<v Speaker 2>It has concluded consistent with prior </v>
<v Speaker 2>residual amounts detected.</v>

775
00:39:40.631 --> 00:39:43.990
<v Speaker 2>And Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jones sample that the presence of Dh cmt</v>

776
00:39:43.991 --> 00:39:44.824
<v Speaker 2>longterm metabolite is consistent with </v>
<v Speaker 2>residual amounts from exposure prior to </v>

777
00:39:49.790 --> 00:39:52.630
<v Speaker 2>to that July 28th,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2017.</v>

778
00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:54.610
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

779
00:39:54.611 --> 00:39:56.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not an expert.</v>

780
00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:57.920
<v Speaker 2>I don't profess to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

781
00:39:58.030 --> 00:39:58.863
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my background's in finance and </v>

782
00:39:59.951 --> 00:40:02.170
<v Speaker 2>accounting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I traced the money back in the old days,</v>

783
00:40:02.171 --> 00:40:06.970
<v Speaker 2>but I know who those experts are out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there in the world and these are them.</v>

784
00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:08.193
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're my putting these things in </v>

785
00:40:09.641 --> 00:40:10.474
<v Speaker 2>writing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>putting their reputations on the line </v>

786
00:40:11.831 --> 00:40:14.380
<v Speaker 2>now and forever going forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

787
00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:17.170
<v Speaker 2>they're never going to do something like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that because you know,</v>

788
00:40:17.171 --> 00:40:18.004
<v Speaker 2>the UFC pays,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you sought it to administer our program </v>

789
00:40:19.931 --> 00:40:22.110
<v Speaker 2>or because Jon Jones is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

790
00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:24.760
<v Speaker 2>a popular fighter and they want to see </v>
<v Speaker 2>him fight this weekend.</v>

791
00:40:24.761 --> 00:40:27.460
<v Speaker 2>That's just not the way this world </v>
<v Speaker 2>works.</v>

792
00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:29.650
<v Speaker 2>Of course in in fact it works the </v>
<v Speaker 2>opposite way.</v>

793
00:40:29.650 --> 00:40:31.870
<v Speaker 2>There would be a great benefit if they </v>
<v Speaker 2>could catch him cheating.</v>

794
00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:33.670
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

795
00:40:33.671 --> 00:40:34.504
<v Speaker 2>historically experts like this are very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very conservative when it comes to </v>

796
00:40:38.441 --> 00:40:42.340
<v Speaker 2>talking in absolutes like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't normally do it.</v>

797
00:40:42.370 --> 00:40:43.203
<v Speaker 2>In all fairness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The real question is guys like you and </v>

798
00:40:44.951 --> 00:40:49.770
<v Speaker 2>me because we are UFC employees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we got to handle this fairly yet.</v>

799
00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:51.090
<v Speaker 2>That argument,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

800
00:40:51.091 --> 00:40:55.150
<v Speaker 2>and I saw that left and right that hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jeff and joe are paid by the UFC.</v>

801
00:40:55.151 --> 00:40:56.830
<v Speaker 2>Of course they're going to come out and </v>
<v Speaker 2>this way,</v>

802
00:40:56.831 --> 00:40:57.664
<v Speaker 2>but look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these things that I'm reciting </v>

803
00:40:58.841 --> 00:41:00.640
<v Speaker 2>today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do that in regards to cheating,</v>

804
00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:02.140
<v Speaker 2>I would either,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

805
00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:05.230
<v Speaker 2>I side with the UFC on a lot of things </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I support the sport.</v>

806
00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:09.250
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to excel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't side ever with cheating.</v>

807
00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:10.113
<v Speaker 2>If I think that there's some way somehow</v>
<v Speaker 2>that someone has given an unfair </v>

808
00:41:14.501 --> 00:41:16.810
<v Speaker 2>advantage and this is somehow being </v>
<v Speaker 2>covered up,</v>

809
00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:18.460
<v Speaker 2>I would rather not work for them.</v>

810
00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:19.710
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my seven,</v>

811
00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:22.970
<v Speaker 2>my last 17 years of my career,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

812
00:41:23.010 --> 00:41:23.950
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

813
00:41:24.010 --> 00:41:24.843
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything that I've worked for is to </v>

814
00:41:25.961 --> 00:41:29.890
<v Speaker 2>protect the rights of clean athletes and</v>
<v Speaker 2>to eradicate cheating from the sport.</v>

815
00:41:29.891 --> 00:41:32.860
<v Speaker 2>I can't tell you how strongly I feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>about that.</v>

816
00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:33.703
<v Speaker 2>Sports given me everything in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My Dad was a high school basketball </v>

817
00:41:36.711 --> 00:41:38.150
<v Speaker 2>coach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

818
00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:41.270
<v Speaker 2>it paid for my college and scholarships.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

819
00:41:41.330 --> 00:41:43.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least the good characteristics in me.</v>

820
00:41:43.491 --> 00:41:48.260
<v Speaker 2>I can all trace directly to sports and </v>
<v Speaker 2>entering into the equation the issues of</v>

821
00:41:48.261 --> 00:41:49.094
<v Speaker 2>breaking the rules,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the issues of the health and safety </v>

822
00:41:51.051 --> 00:41:54.410
<v Speaker 2>aspects when you have young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I talked to many parents whose kids,</v>

823
00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:55.463
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>use steroids because they saw the </v>

824
00:41:56.991 --> 00:41:57.824
<v Speaker 2>professional athletes doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>answering that into the body when your </v>

825
00:42:00.861 --> 00:42:03.410
<v Speaker 2>homeowner levels are already out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>control is very,</v>

826
00:42:03.411 --> 00:42:05.570
<v Speaker 2>very dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both short and longterm.</v>

827
00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:09.320
<v Speaker 2>Can't tell you how passionate I am about</v>
<v Speaker 2>this issue.</v>

828
00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:14.030
<v Speaker 2>And those out there that are saying that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm corrupt and my reputation has is out</v>

829
00:42:14.031 --> 00:42:14.864
<v Speaker 2>the window.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would never ever in a million years </v>

830
00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:20.330
<v Speaker 2>sales people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you obviously you have,</v>

831
00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:23.060
<v Speaker 2>but you just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't listen to those people because</v>

832
00:42:23.090 --> 00:42:26.880
<v Speaker 2>they want to find things wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

833
00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:28.543
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that I've said about </v>
<v Speaker 2>you is you're a guy loves to catch </v>

834
00:42:30.291 --> 00:42:31.730
<v Speaker 2>people cheating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You like it,</v>

835
00:42:31.970 --> 00:42:33.650
<v Speaker 2>you enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not true,</v>

836
00:42:33.651 --> 00:42:34.370
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You do.</v>

837
00:42:34.370 --> 00:42:35.203
<v Speaker 2>I don't mind if someone is cheating and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you catch them in the UFC program now </v>

838
00:42:40.161 --> 00:42:42.860
<v Speaker 2>with what we've established here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

839
00:42:42.861 --> 00:42:44.780
<v Speaker 2>Back in the old days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we've talked about this,</v>

840
00:42:44.781 --> 00:42:47.690
<v Speaker 2>look when you had in baseball or in </v>
<v Speaker 2>cycling,</v>

841
00:42:48.410 --> 00:42:51.470
<v Speaker 2>no testing going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Literally the organizations were looking</v>

842
00:42:51.471 --> 00:42:53.390
<v Speaker 2>in the other direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've often said that,</v>

843
00:42:53.391 --> 00:42:55.010
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't agree with what they did,</v>

844
00:42:55.011 --> 00:42:55.844
<v Speaker 2>but there's a portion of me and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>why I think a lot of these athletes </v>

845
00:42:58.821 --> 00:43:00.710
<v Speaker 2>respected me and share that information.</v>

846
00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:04.190
<v Speaker 2>But there's a portion of me that said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't agree with what you did.</v>

847
00:43:04.191 --> 00:43:06.110
<v Speaker 2>I like to think I wouldn't make the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>decision,</v>

848
00:43:06.111 --> 00:43:08.270
<v Speaker 2>but I damn well understand why you did </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

849
00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:10.940
<v Speaker 2>You're fighting for millions of dollars </v>
<v Speaker 2>in contracts.</v>

850
00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:12.013
<v Speaker 2>You know your teammates are doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know your competitors are doing it </v>

851
00:43:15.231 --> 00:43:19.100
<v Speaker 2>and your know your professional sports </v>
<v Speaker 2>organization doesn't give a shit because</v>

852
00:43:19.101 --> 00:43:22.070
<v Speaker 2>of the weakness of the testing program </v>
<v Speaker 2>or total lack thereof.</v>

853
00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:24.200
<v Speaker 2>So in instances like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was,</v>

854
00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:27.560
<v Speaker 2>I never came away saying that guy's an </v>
<v Speaker 2>idiot or an asshole for choose.</v>

855
00:43:27.561 --> 00:43:30.350
<v Speaker 2>And I came away saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of get why he did it.</v>

856
00:43:30.351 --> 00:43:32.750
<v Speaker 2>If I was 21 or 22 years old and </v>
<v Speaker 2>immature,</v>

857
00:43:32.751 --> 00:43:37.430
<v Speaker 2>I may have made the same decision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now come into our program here where you</v>

858
00:43:37.431 --> 00:43:39.830
<v Speaker 2>have an organization that cares very </v>
<v Speaker 2>much,</v>

859
00:43:39.831 --> 00:43:40.664
<v Speaker 2>that spends multimillion dollars a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This program has done nothing but costs </v>

860
00:43:44.841 --> 00:43:46.190
<v Speaker 2>the UFC money.</v>

861
00:43:46.430 --> 00:43:47.263
<v Speaker 2>It costs us money and how we implement </v>
<v Speaker 2>the program costs us money on canceling </v>

862
00:43:50.721 --> 00:43:51.554
<v Speaker 2>fights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anybody who thinks moving this fight to </v>

863
00:43:53.871 --> 00:43:57.830
<v Speaker 2>California is that a financial benefit </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the UFC is crazy.</v>

864
00:43:57.831 --> 00:44:01.610
<v Speaker 2>We're taking a bath on this one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People really do need to understand that</v>

865
00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:04.970
<v Speaker 2>the UFC decided themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they self imposed.</v>

866
00:44:04.971 --> 00:44:08.240
<v Speaker 2>You sought as sanctioning of fights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

867
00:44:08.290 --> 00:44:10.070
<v Speaker 2>Nobody forced us to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is a,</v>

868
00:44:10.071 --> 00:44:10.904
<v Speaker 2>this was a big step in the right </v>
<v Speaker 2>direction of trying to make the sport </v>

869
00:44:14.841 --> 00:44:17.570
<v Speaker 2>cleaner because we recognize that first </v>
<v Speaker 2>of all,</v>

870
00:44:17.610 --> 00:44:18.443
<v Speaker 2>there was some legal stuff with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>testosterone replacement therapy that </v>

871
00:44:20.811 --> 00:44:22.190
<v Speaker 2>just threw everything out of whack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

872
00:44:22.490 --> 00:44:26.600
<v Speaker 2>Where it was essentially it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>sanctioned cheating.</v>

873
00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:28.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's be honest about what that was.</v>

874
00:44:28.670 --> 00:44:29.503
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was clearly a my understanding being </v>

875
00:44:30.441 --> 00:44:31.440
<v Speaker 2>manipulated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

876
00:44:31.460 --> 00:44:32.293
<v Speaker 2>I'm the very easy to manipulate when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>get permission to use any prohibited </v>

877
00:44:35.311 --> 00:44:36.180
<v Speaker 2>substance like that.</v>

878
00:44:36.330 --> 00:44:41.160
<v Speaker 2>And we went from that to unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 2>strict protocols.</v>

879
00:44:41.161 --> 00:44:43.890
<v Speaker 2>And now what you're seeing is you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing,</v>

880
00:44:43.891 --> 00:44:46.860
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we saw a radical change in the physiques</v>

881
00:44:46.861 --> 00:44:47.694
<v Speaker 2>of some fighters where we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we did have some suspicions and those </v>

882
00:44:50.461 --> 00:44:53.100
<v Speaker 2>suspicions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least in my eyes had been confirmed.</v>

883
00:44:53.610 --> 00:44:54.443
<v Speaker 2>And now we're seeing the good side of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this with what in your estimation might </v>

884
00:45:01.711 --> 00:45:06.711
<v Speaker 2>have been moved over into a position </v>
<v Speaker 2>where okay now now it's getting a little</v>

885
00:45:07.711 --> 00:45:11.610
<v Speaker 2>bit ridiculous in terms of like what we </v>
<v Speaker 2>can detect and what is,</v>

886
00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:14.580
<v Speaker 2>what is causing fights to be canceled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

887
00:45:14.581 --> 00:45:17.990
<v Speaker 2>So interestingly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world antidoping agency,</v>

888
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:23.000
<v Speaker 2>a lot of their next code revision is </v>
<v Speaker 2>2021 and so they regularly put out,</v>

889
00:45:23.101 --> 00:45:23.934
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are the issues going forward that </v>

890
00:45:25.321 --> 00:45:26.154
<v Speaker 2>we want to address?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the major issues is </v>

891
00:45:28.321 --> 00:45:29.154
<v Speaker 2>potentially establishing thresholds for </v>
<v Speaker 2>these low level substances that keep </v>

892
00:45:34.651 --> 00:45:35.484
<v Speaker 2>appearing.</v>

893
00:45:35.790 --> 00:45:38.370
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>DH cmt being one of them,</v>

894
00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:42.990
<v Speaker 2>Austrian being one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the idea that water is looking at</v>

895
00:45:42.991 --> 00:45:46.020
<v Speaker 2>and has a working group of worldwide </v>
<v Speaker 2>experts is,</v>

896
00:45:46.021 --> 00:45:46.854
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if if something that gets reported back </v>

897
00:45:48.001 --> 00:45:52.290
<v Speaker 2>and under 50 Pika grams,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the evidence is showing,</v>

898
00:45:52.350 --> 00:45:53.183
<v Speaker 2>more likely than not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is from a very low level </v>

899
00:45:55.321 --> 00:45:56.154
<v Speaker 2>contaminant issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've never seen an issue of a micro </v>

900
00:45:58.250 --> 00:46:00.960
<v Speaker 2>dosing or an intentional use that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>reached that level.</v>

901
00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:02.093
<v Speaker 2>Why are the labs even reporting at sub </v>
<v Speaker 2>at quantities lower than 50 pika grams </v>

902
00:46:07.351 --> 00:46:08.184
<v Speaker 2>or 100 peak grounds?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think very soon they're going to come </v>

903
00:46:09.751 --> 00:46:10.584
<v Speaker 2>out with a recommendation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are going to adopt that before 2021 </v>

904
00:46:14.581 --> 00:46:17.820
<v Speaker 2>once that working group and we're in </v>
<v Speaker 2>communication with them,</v>

905
00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:18.953
<v Speaker 2>comes up with those recommendations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll see it it implement it first in </v>

906
00:46:21.451 --> 00:46:22.890
<v Speaker 2>the UFC program,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

907
00:46:23.130 --> 00:46:23.963
<v Speaker 2>I've always said fairness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Due process in a program is just as </v>

908
00:46:28.531 --> 00:46:30.420
<v Speaker 2>important as the strength and </v>
<v Speaker 2>comprehension,</v>

909
00:46:30.750 --> 00:46:32.280
<v Speaker 2>comprehensiveness of that program.</v>

910
00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:33.113
<v Speaker 2>You'll lose faith in your athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could have the strongest loophole </v>

911
00:46:36.571 --> 00:46:37.404
<v Speaker 2>free program in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you start implement tink things </v>

912
00:46:40.530 --> 00:46:43.770
<v Speaker 2>unfairly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll lose faith just as much as if you</v>

913
00:46:43.771 --> 00:46:46.530
<v Speaker 2>had a bunch of loopholes in the program.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got to be fair.</v>

914
00:46:46.890 --> 00:46:51.270
<v Speaker 2>Are you aware of the female skier that </v>
<v Speaker 2>tested positive because of lip balm?</v>

915
00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:53.070
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

916
00:46:53.071 --> 00:46:53.904
<v Speaker 2>it's vaguely recall about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was someone else use the lip balm </v>

917
00:46:56.311 --> 00:46:57.510
<v Speaker 2>before her?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

918
00:46:57.540 --> 00:46:58.081
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

919
00:46:58.081 --> 00:46:59.070
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a,</v>

920
00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:01.020
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lip balm for sunburn.</v>

921
00:47:01.620 --> 00:47:06.620
<v Speaker 2>It was for sunburnt lips and it had some</v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculously small trace amount.</v>

922
00:47:07.410 --> 00:47:09.540
<v Speaker 2>Was it Austin Green cv?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Give her name?</v>

923
00:47:09.541 --> 00:47:12.260
<v Speaker 2>Is Jo Jo Burg?</v>

924
00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:15.590
<v Speaker 2>Trying to remember her name?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

925
00:47:15.690 --> 00:47:18.510
<v Speaker 2>there was the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cocaine kissing defense was actually</v>

926
00:47:18.511 --> 00:47:20.640
<v Speaker 2>one an arbitration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So something similar,</v>

927
00:47:20.641 --> 00:47:23.820
<v Speaker 2>somebody tested positive for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

928
00:47:23.821 --> 00:47:26.760
<v Speaker 2>low level metabolites,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a cocaine and basically said,</v>

929
00:47:26.761 --> 00:47:27.300
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

930
00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:28.590
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether that was good or not,</v>

931
00:47:28.591 --> 00:47:30.310
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

932
00:47:30.311 --> 00:47:32.080
<v Speaker 2>the arbitrator bought it and the science</v>
<v Speaker 2>shows,</v>

933
00:47:32.081 --> 00:47:33.640
<v Speaker 2>hey that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is a possibility.</v>

934
00:47:33.641 --> 00:47:34.474
<v Speaker 2>The detection levels are so low.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you kiss somebody who had just done </v>

935
00:47:38.530 --> 00:47:39.363
<v Speaker 2>cocaine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're now able to detect at those </v>

936
00:47:40.991 --> 00:47:43.240
<v Speaker 2>levels in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the person that kiss that person.</v>

937
00:47:44.290 --> 00:47:45.123
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you find this woman doping label on </v>

938
00:47:48.161 --> 00:47:48.994
<v Speaker 2>the label,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why they gave her a penalty </v>

939
00:47:50.650 --> 00:47:51.431
<v Speaker 2>apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

940
00:47:51.431 --> 00:47:52.390
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

941
00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:54.070
<v Speaker 2>What is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

942
00:47:54.340 --> 00:47:57.430
<v Speaker 2>who fucks reading labels on lip off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

943
00:47:57.670 --> 00:47:58.503
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

944
00:47:58.590 --> 00:48:00.250
<v Speaker 2>that's how crazy it's gotten.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

945
00:48:00.251 --> 00:48:01.084
<v Speaker 2>all our athletes know when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they're using a creatine or a </v>

946
00:48:03.611 --> 00:48:04.444
<v Speaker 2>protein or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think most of them are pretty careful </v>

947
00:48:06.221 --> 00:48:06.670
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

948
00:48:06.670 --> 00:48:08.230
<v Speaker 2>But to tell them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

949
00:48:08.231 --> 00:48:11.170
<v Speaker 2>you need to read your lip balm and your </v>
<v Speaker 2>deodorant.</v>

950
00:48:11.171 --> 00:48:11.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>

951
00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:15.790
<v Speaker 2>what level are we get into here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And these are the levels of detection.</v>

952
00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:16.833
<v Speaker 2>So she 21,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nine year old starved Norway's </v>

953
00:48:18.551 --> 00:48:19.384
<v Speaker 2>powerhouse squad of a skiing cross </v>
<v Speaker 2>country skiing tested positive for an </v>

954
00:48:22.590 --> 00:48:26.110
<v Speaker 2>hour anabolic agent listed in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>contents of a treatment for sunburn.</v>

955
00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:28.473
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this could be similar in some ways to </v>

956
00:48:31.511 --> 00:48:34.900
<v Speaker 2>what Chad Mendez tested positive for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for something for psoriasis.</v>

957
00:48:34.901 --> 00:48:36.480
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sat chatman is,</v>

958
00:48:36.481 --> 00:48:38.830
<v Speaker 2>has obvious psoriasis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd see it on his body.</v>

959
00:48:39.250 --> 00:48:43.540
<v Speaker 2>He's talked about it pretty openly and </v>
<v Speaker 2>to use some sort of a cream and accepted</v>

960
00:48:43.541 --> 00:48:46.150
<v Speaker 2>his penalty wasn't a word of this cream </v>
<v Speaker 2>had something,</v>

961
00:48:46.151 --> 00:48:48.400
<v Speaker 2>some type of a steroid into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

962
00:48:48.401 --> 00:48:49.234
<v Speaker 2>I had seen him publicly state that now </v>
<v Speaker 2>he chose not to present a defense or go </v>

963
00:48:52.681 --> 00:48:53.514
<v Speaker 2>to arbitration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I haven't seen anything in detail to </v>

964
00:48:55.830 --> 00:48:56.250
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

965
00:48:56.250 --> 00:48:58.420
<v Speaker 2>He just rode knowledgeable on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

966
00:48:58.421 --> 00:49:00.010
<v Speaker 2>he did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

967
00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:00.853
<v Speaker 2>So let's get back to the Frank Mir case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Frank near tested positive was it also </v>

968
00:49:05.021 --> 00:49:05.854
<v Speaker 2>also same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>longterm metabolite of world Terenna </v>

969
00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:09.460
<v Speaker 2>Ball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the difference.</v>

970
00:49:09.700 --> 00:49:14.700
<v Speaker 2>Frank Mir as the same as John Jones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His first time through was sanctioned.</v>

971
00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:19.150
<v Speaker 2>John didn't get off the first time that </v>
<v Speaker 2>showed up in his system.</v>

972
00:49:19.151 --> 00:49:19.901
<v Speaker 2>He got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

973
00:49:19.901 --> 00:49:23.020
<v Speaker 2>he was looking at potential for years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>went to arbitration,</v>

974
00:49:23.530 --> 00:49:24.363
<v Speaker 2>presented evidence and act as some other</v>
<v Speaker 2>clauses in the policy that reduced his </v>

975
00:49:28.211 --> 00:49:29.980
<v Speaker 2>sanction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>

976
00:49:30.070 --> 00:49:30.851
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

977
00:49:30.851 --> 00:49:32.310
<v Speaker 2>one of them was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

978
00:49:32.590 --> 00:49:37.120
<v Speaker 2>substantial assistance where he assisted</v>
<v Speaker 2>Usada and some way,</v>

979
00:49:37.121 --> 00:49:39.160
<v Speaker 2>shape or form and he got a reduction </v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

980
00:49:39.190 --> 00:49:40.870
<v Speaker 2>for doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Assisted in what way?</v>

981
00:49:41.290 --> 00:49:42.123
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is the exact reason why I do </v>

982
00:49:44.561 --> 00:49:45.394
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I insulate myself from that </v>

983
00:49:47.561 --> 00:49:50.200
<v Speaker 2>interaction between you sought it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the athlete,</v>

984
00:49:50.201 --> 00:49:53.860
<v Speaker 2>they are the soldier to adjudicate or in</v>
<v Speaker 2>this they do not.</v>

985
00:49:54.190 --> 00:49:56.210
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get me on the phone and say,</v>

986
00:49:56.211 --> 00:49:57.610
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're thinking about going this way.</v>

987
00:49:57.611 --> 00:50:00.190
<v Speaker 2>They adjudicate completely in a vacuum </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you are,</v>

988
00:50:00.191 --> 00:50:04.660
<v Speaker 2>you're just so people know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your title is safety,</v>

989
00:50:04.661 --> 00:50:06.700
<v Speaker 2>health and safety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Athlete health and performance.</v>

990
00:50:06.701 --> 00:50:08.590
<v Speaker 2>Vice President of athlete health and </v>
<v Speaker 2>performance.</v>

991
00:50:08.591 --> 00:50:11.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you no longer work for you saw it.</v>

992
00:50:11.411 --> 00:50:12.730
<v Speaker 2>It never worked for Usada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

993
00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:13.593
<v Speaker 2>that's a big misconception a lot of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighters think that I've never worked </v>

994
00:50:15.641 --> 00:50:16.271
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you saw it.</v>

995
00:50:16.271 --> 00:50:19.120
<v Speaker 2>I was a federal agent for 22 and a half </v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

996
00:50:19.530 --> 00:50:20.363
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the latter part of my career got </v>

997
00:50:21.851 --> 00:50:25.390
<v Speaker 2>involved with all these ped distribution</v>
<v Speaker 2>cases.</v>

998
00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:30.840
<v Speaker 2>2015 Lorenzo Fertitta and Dana white </v>
<v Speaker 2>through a mutual friend contacted me and</v>

999
00:50:31.371 --> 00:50:31.611
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1000
00:50:31.611 --> 00:50:33.680
<v Speaker 2>would you come out and kind of talk to </v>
<v Speaker 2>us?</v>

1001
00:50:33.681 --> 00:50:36.340
<v Speaker 2>We're contemplating maybe putting our </v>
<v Speaker 2>own program together.</v>

1002
00:50:36.350 --> 00:50:39.050
<v Speaker 2>We've had some recent high profile </v>
<v Speaker 2>positive.</v>

1003
00:50:39.051 --> 00:50:39.884
<v Speaker 2>So I came out to vegas a talk with them </v>
<v Speaker 2>and a week later I get a phone call </v>

1004
00:50:43.551 --> 00:50:47.000
<v Speaker 2>asking if I want to come work for him </v>
<v Speaker 2>and kind of implement this new program.</v>

1005
00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:49.760
<v Speaker 2>But I've never been an employee of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Usada.</v>

1006
00:50:49.790 --> 00:50:50.620
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>

1007
00:50:50.620 --> 00:50:51.453
<v Speaker 2>that's good to know because that's been </v>
<v Speaker 2>stated by some public figures that you </v>

1008
00:50:54.171 --> 00:50:56.990
<v Speaker 2>used to work for Usada and now you work </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the UFC.</v>

1009
00:50:57.020 --> 00:51:00.230
<v Speaker 2>Never that on a shale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of my favorite words.</v>

1010
00:51:01.010 --> 00:51:03.440
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you never worked for you soda,</v>

1011
00:51:03.650 --> 00:51:04.820
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1012
00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:05.713
<v Speaker 2>brought Usada to the UFC or communicated</v>
<v Speaker 2>with Usada and facilitated this </v>

1013
00:51:09.711 --> 00:51:11.210
<v Speaker 2>agreement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

1014
00:51:11.211 --> 00:51:15.710
<v Speaker 2>So I never worked for Usada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did work very closely with Usada.</v>

1015
00:51:15.711 --> 00:51:16.544
<v Speaker 2>So you saw that when I first started </v>
<v Speaker 2>these series of investigations back in </v>

1016
00:51:19.371 --> 00:51:20.480
<v Speaker 2>2002,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1017
00:51:20.481 --> 00:51:21.314
<v Speaker 2>I knew all about how to work a heroin </v>
<v Speaker 2>distribution organization and cocaine </v>

1018
00:51:25.071 --> 00:51:27.290
<v Speaker 2>distribution organization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>methamphetamine.</v>

1019
00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:30.050
<v Speaker 2>But when it came to performance </v>
<v Speaker 2>enhancing drugs,</v>

1020
00:51:30.051 --> 00:51:30.884
<v Speaker 2>there was no class that myself or really</v>
<v Speaker 2>any other federal agent or law </v>

1021
00:51:34.371 --> 00:51:35.204
<v Speaker 2>enforcement agent goes through </v>
<v Speaker 2>surrounding distribution of performance </v>

1022
00:51:38.211 --> 00:51:42.740
<v Speaker 2>enhancing drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was examining the discarded garbage</v>

1023
00:51:42.741 --> 00:51:45.560
<v Speaker 2>of Balco every week when they put it out</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the curb,</v>

1024
00:51:45.980 --> 00:51:48.530
<v Speaker 2>began seeing notes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rappers,</v>

1025
00:51:48.531 --> 00:51:49.490
<v Speaker 2>all these substances.</v>

1026
00:51:49.490 --> 00:51:50.323
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea what these things were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know the difference between </v>

1027
00:51:52.971 --> 00:51:56.540
<v Speaker 2>testosterone epitestosterone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>arithroid tin,</v>

1028
00:51:56.650 --> 00:51:57.920
<v Speaker 2>hgh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew nothing.</v>

1029
00:51:58.460 --> 00:52:01.820
<v Speaker 2>So what I did is I figured out who those</v>
<v Speaker 2>experts were,</v>

1030
00:52:01.850 --> 00:52:05.420
<v Speaker 2>who were the people that could very </v>
<v Speaker 2>quickly get me up to speed on what I was</v>

1031
00:52:05.421 --> 00:52:06.990
<v Speaker 2>looking at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1032
00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:07.853
<v Speaker 2>doctor Catlin who ran the UCL Olympic </v>
<v Speaker 2>loud was one of the first and he </v>

1033
00:52:10.971 --> 00:52:12.320
<v Speaker 2>started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1034
00:52:12.321 --> 00:52:13.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of walking me through this.</v>

1035
00:52:13.791 --> 00:52:16.200
<v Speaker 2>He put me in touch with Usada and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1036
00:52:16.310 --> 00:52:18.620
<v Speaker 2>they began educating me as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1037
00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:21.920
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>over the course of those investigations,</v>

1038
00:52:22.150 --> 00:52:22.983
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a lot from them in terms of </v>

1039
00:52:24.291 --> 00:52:25.124
<v Speaker 2>educating on the substances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were bringing some of their </v>

1040
00:52:26.871 --> 00:52:27.704
<v Speaker 2>cooperating witnesses to me and then we </v>
<v Speaker 2>go off and running on criminal </v>

1041
00:52:30.891 --> 00:52:32.500
<v Speaker 2>investigations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1042
00:52:32.750 --> 00:52:34.700
<v Speaker 2>but never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never worked for them.</v>

1043
00:52:34.850 --> 00:52:37.370
<v Speaker 2>So you sought a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>correct me if I'm wrong,</v>

1044
00:52:37.371 --> 00:52:40.790
<v Speaker 2>but the way they would work would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>very compartmentalized.</v>

1045
00:52:40.790 --> 00:52:41.623
<v Speaker 2>Like they would not specifically </v>
<v Speaker 2>communicate with you on all of the </v>

1046
00:52:44.751 --> 00:52:46.310
<v Speaker 2>details of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

1047
00:52:46.311 --> 00:52:47.410
<v Speaker 2>And they don't now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1048
00:52:47.710 --> 00:52:49.640
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>independence aspect.</v>

1049
00:52:49.641 --> 00:52:53.960
<v Speaker 2>I don't as these deliberations are going</v>
<v Speaker 2>on what they're looking at,</v>

1050
00:52:53.961 --> 00:52:56.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's cooperation.</v>

1051
00:52:56.440 --> 00:52:57.273
<v Speaker 2>Just for me to be Frank Wood in my eyes </v>
<v Speaker 2>would mean that something was done </v>

1052
00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:06.170
<v Speaker 2>purposely illegally and this person had </v>
<v Speaker 2>some knowledge of purpose,</v>

1053
00:53:06.410 --> 00:53:08.630
<v Speaker 2>purposeful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>illegal activity,</v>

1054
00:53:08.810 --> 00:53:13.810
<v Speaker 2>and that they would somehow communicate </v>
<v Speaker 2>this to facilitate some sort of catching</v>

1055
00:53:15.020 --> 00:53:17.900
<v Speaker 2>of someone involved in a criminal act or</v>
<v Speaker 2>an act of cheating.</v>

1056
00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:18.481
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1057
00:53:18.481 --> 00:53:19.670
<v Speaker 2>that would make sense to me too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1058
00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:21.770
<v Speaker 2>That would be what we were talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

1059
00:53:21.771 --> 00:53:22.604
<v Speaker 2>Usada would allow John a shorter </v>
<v Speaker 2>suspension if he actively participated </v>

1060
00:53:27.541 --> 00:53:31.050
<v Speaker 2>in helping them catch people that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>cheating that that's the understanding.</v>

1061
00:53:31.051 --> 00:53:33.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>implied that would be implied.</v>

1062
00:53:33.091 --> 00:53:34.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't know to what level that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>

1063
00:53:34.830 --> 00:53:37.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it was that or if it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

1064
00:53:37.201 --> 00:53:38.034
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's how this drug works in more </v>

1065
00:53:40.261 --> 00:53:41.150
<v Speaker 2>general.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the,</v>

1066
00:53:41.151 --> 00:53:43.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I purposely,</v>

1067
00:53:43.410 --> 00:53:46.080
<v Speaker 2>that would mean that John would have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>know about cheating.</v>

1068
00:53:46.650 --> 00:53:49.110
<v Speaker 2>If you're saying like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is how this jug drug works.</v>

1069
00:53:49.111 --> 00:53:50.610
<v Speaker 2>This is how I used it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1070
00:53:50.611 --> 00:53:51.444
<v Speaker 2>this would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would,</v>

1071
00:53:51.980 --> 00:53:52.813
<v Speaker 2>that would mean his initial defense </v>
<v Speaker 2>would have to be thrown out the window </v>

1072
00:53:54.721 --> 00:53:56.070
<v Speaker 2>because it wasn't an accident.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1073
00:53:56.071 --> 00:53:57.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about that.</v>

1074
00:53:57.421 --> 00:53:59.790
<v Speaker 2>If you knew something separate from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1075
00:53:59.850 --> 00:54:01.830
<v Speaker 2>that he wasn't someone else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1076
00:54:01.831 --> 00:54:02.910
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1077
00:54:02.970 --> 00:54:04.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't want anybody to reach that </v>
<v Speaker 2>conclusion.</v>

1078
00:54:04.831 --> 00:54:08.820
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea what his substantial </v>
<v Speaker 2>assistance entailed.</v>

1079
00:54:08.850 --> 00:54:10.460
<v Speaker 2>None.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1080
00:54:10.470 --> 00:54:13.110
<v Speaker 2>and it's a slippery slope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is a slippery slope and look,</v>

1081
00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:17.580
<v Speaker 2>transparency's important in any program,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1082
00:54:17.581 --> 00:54:19.200
<v Speaker 2>only to a certain level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1083
00:54:19.201 --> 00:54:21.960
<v Speaker 2>if you are transparent about what </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone's,</v>

1084
00:54:22.190 --> 00:54:24.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cooperation or substantial assistant was</v>

1085
00:54:25.260 --> 00:54:26.093
<v Speaker 2>and the whole world knew about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're never going to get anybody after </v>

1086
00:54:28.501 --> 00:54:29.960
<v Speaker 2>that coming in and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1087
00:54:29.961 --> 00:54:30.990
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and cooperating.</v>

1088
00:54:30.990 --> 00:54:34.890
<v Speaker 2>I saw this definitely on the criminal </v>
<v Speaker 2>side with informants,</v>

1089
00:54:34.891 --> 00:54:36.750
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not something that's,</v>

1090
00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:39.390
<v Speaker 2>that you want to be transparent about or</v>
<v Speaker 2>disclose.</v>

1091
00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:40.343
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's going to be a bunch of </v>

1092
00:54:41.581 --> 00:54:44.640
<v Speaker 2>people that have a real issue with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the idea that Jon Jones,</v>

1093
00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:47.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the greatest fighters of all time</v>

1094
00:54:47.191 --> 00:54:49.660
<v Speaker 2>is actually working as an informant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

1095
00:54:49.661 --> 00:54:51.120
<v Speaker 2>it's listed in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>

1096
00:54:51.190 --> 00:54:52.023
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the Mclaren's ruling that that was </v>

1097
00:54:53.071 --> 00:54:56.520
<v Speaker 2>one of the reasons for the mitigating </v>
<v Speaker 2>factor and the reduction.</v>

1098
00:54:56.521 --> 00:54:57.480
<v Speaker 2>But I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1099
00:54:58.820 --> 00:55:01.500
<v Speaker 2>I know nothing about to leave that alone</v>
<v Speaker 2>and about it.</v>

1100
00:55:01.501 --> 00:55:03.030
<v Speaker 2>It's been stated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know what it is.</v>

1101
00:55:03.031 --> 00:55:04.950
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or we know that it's a thing.</v>

1102
00:55:05.390 --> 00:55:10.390
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to the John's initial test</v>

1103
00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:11.633
<v Speaker 2>where he was sanctioned and was </v>
<v Speaker 2>suspended for a determined period of </v>

1104
00:55:15.841 --> 00:55:16.674
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Frank Mir also was sanctioned for a </v>

1105
00:55:19.921 --> 00:55:21.210
<v Speaker 2>determined period of time as well.</v>

1106
00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:22.500
<v Speaker 2>He was two years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>

1107
00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:23.753
<v Speaker 2>John was shorter than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>John was sean cooperate on a bunch of </v>

1108
00:55:26.251 --> 00:55:28.710
<v Speaker 2>other deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] not only cooperative,</v>

1109
00:55:28.711 --> 00:55:30.840
<v Speaker 2>he went to arbitration and put on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>defense.</v>

1110
00:55:30.841 --> 00:55:32.400
<v Speaker 2>He put on a defense that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1111
00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:35.880
<v Speaker 2>the evidence here shows no intentional </v>
<v Speaker 2>ingestion of it.</v>

1112
00:55:35.881 --> 00:55:40.110
<v Speaker 2>And in fact the Clara and gave him a </v>
<v Speaker 2>further reduction based on,</v>

1113
00:55:40.111 --> 00:55:42.900
<v Speaker 2>there was no evidence of this was </v>
<v Speaker 2>intentionally done.</v>

1114
00:55:43.290 --> 00:55:44.123
<v Speaker 2>Frank Mir didn't put on any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had every right to go to arbitration </v>

1115
00:55:46.860 --> 00:55:48.990
<v Speaker 2>put on his own offense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Didn't do that.</v>

1116
00:55:49.050 --> 00:55:50.900
<v Speaker 2>What about Josh Barnett?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1117
00:55:50.940 --> 00:55:51.930
<v Speaker 2>Josh Barnett,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1118
00:55:51.931 --> 00:55:56.010
<v Speaker 2>a completely different set of facts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His came from a contaminated supplement.</v>

1119
00:55:56.280 --> 00:55:59.970
<v Speaker 2>It was a different substance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He went to an arbitration hearing,</v>

1120
00:56:00.270 --> 00:56:02.850
<v Speaker 2>the arbitrator ruled with Josh and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep,</v>

1121
00:56:02.970 --> 00:56:03.803
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>based on where we are now based on the </v>

1122
00:56:05.971 --> 00:56:08.550
<v Speaker 2>care and effort that you took your </v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1123
00:56:08.551 --> 00:56:12.840
<v Speaker 2>you deserve to have time served at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time of that arbitration.</v>

1124
00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:13.913
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a good example of the </v>

1125
00:56:15.001 --> 00:56:19.260
<v Speaker 2>checks and balances in place here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've gotten me overseeing the program,</v>

1126
00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:21.360
<v Speaker 2>taking a look at how these things come </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

1127
00:56:21.690 --> 00:56:26.690
<v Speaker 2>You've got the ability from the athlete </v>
<v Speaker 2>to go to Mclaren's group and judge,</v>

1128
00:56:26.980 --> 00:56:28.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the set of facts.</v>

1129
00:56:28.031 --> 00:56:28.864
<v Speaker 2>And in that case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mclaren's group said you saw Usada I </v>

1130
00:56:30.491 --> 00:56:35.491
<v Speaker 2>think maybe overreached a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>here and I believe Josh and Josh is,</v>

1131
00:56:35.801 --> 00:56:37.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically time served.</v>

1132
00:56:37.421 --> 00:56:39.310
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to see,</v>

1133
00:56:39.490 --> 00:56:42.250
<v Speaker 2>you want to see them get it perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right every time.</v>

1134
00:56:42.251 --> 00:56:43.084
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the reality in the real world is </v>

1135
00:56:44.471 --> 00:56:45.304
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't necessarily happen and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why you have these checks and </v>

1136
00:56:47.141 --> 00:56:49.390
<v Speaker 2>balances available.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1137
00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:50.253
<v Speaker 2>Josh Barnett take on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The matter is that they tried to paint </v>

1138
00:56:52.721 --> 00:56:55.800
<v Speaker 2>him as guilty even though he was not and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he,</v>

1139
00:56:55.801 --> 00:56:56.634
<v Speaker 2>he feels like he definitely got a bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>deal and that he was labeled as someone </v>

1140
00:57:01.091 --> 00:57:02.830
<v Speaker 2>who is taking this substance.</v>

1141
00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:03.873
<v Speaker 2>He was suspended for a long period of </v>
<v Speaker 2>time when he was going through this and </v>

1142
00:57:06.011 --> 00:57:06.844
<v Speaker 2>although he was found not guilty that he</v>
<v Speaker 2>feels like not enough emphasis was put </v>

1143
00:57:13.091 --> 00:57:16.450
<v Speaker 2>into establishing that he was not guilty</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that you know,</v>

1144
00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:17.313
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he feels like they chased him down over </v>

1145
00:57:19.481 --> 00:57:21.010
<v Speaker 2>something that he didn't do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1146
00:57:21.011 --> 00:57:21.844
<v Speaker 2>I mean we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well here's what he did do is he used a </v>

1147
00:57:24.041 --> 00:57:24.874
<v Speaker 2>supplement that if he would have </v>
<v Speaker 2>listened to anything that we educate on </v>

1148
00:57:27.911 --> 00:57:31.420
<v Speaker 2>that you sought a sends out regular </v>
<v Speaker 2>reminders are fighters are required on a</v>

1149
00:57:31.421 --> 00:57:35.200
<v Speaker 2>quarterly basis to go through videos and</v>
<v Speaker 2>their whereabouts,</v>

1150
00:57:35.201 --> 00:57:36.034
<v Speaker 2>filing that deals with these issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he would have followed any of that </v>

1151
00:57:38.951 --> 00:57:41.080
<v Speaker 2>advice when it came to his supplement </v>
<v Speaker 2>choices,</v>

1152
00:57:41.081 --> 00:57:43.900
<v Speaker 2>he would have never chosen the </v>
<v Speaker 2>supplement he used.</v>

1153
00:57:43.901 --> 00:57:44.890
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1154
00:57:44.891 --> 00:57:45.724
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I heard about that supplement and </v>

1155
00:57:46.781 --> 00:57:48.850
<v Speaker 2>what was on the label and how it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>marketed,</v>

1156
00:57:49.270 --> 00:57:49.961
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1157
00:57:49.961 --> 00:57:50.794
<v Speaker 2>well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's likely the candidate of where it </v>

1158
00:57:52.001 --> 00:57:52.780
<v Speaker 2>came from.</v>

1159
00:57:52.780 --> 00:57:53.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>

1160
00:57:53.771 --> 00:57:55.210
<v Speaker 2>the analysis would be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1161
00:57:55.211 --> 00:57:57.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that pool will be careful.</v>

1162
00:57:57.071 --> 00:57:59.680
<v Speaker 2>There's sharks swimming in that pool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can eat you.</v>

1163
00:58:00.070 --> 00:58:02.230
<v Speaker 2>And the person jumps in the water anyway</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

1164
00:58:02.231 --> 00:58:03.760
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to get eaten by a shark,</v>

1165
00:58:03.761 --> 00:58:05.980
<v Speaker 2>but a shark comes up and aid them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1166
00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:08.480
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we told you that this was the case.</v>

1167
00:58:08.481 --> 00:58:09.314
<v Speaker 2>She didn't follow that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now there also needs to be a </v>

1168
00:58:10.961 --> 00:58:13.960
<v Speaker 2>differentiation between someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>intentional,</v>

1169
00:58:13.961 --> 00:58:15.370
<v Speaker 2>cheating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>intentionally cheating,</v>

1170
00:58:15.700 --> 00:58:17.290
<v Speaker 2>and someone that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1171
00:58:17.291 --> 00:58:20.650
<v Speaker 2>makes a naive supplement choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There.</v>

1172
00:58:20.651 --> 00:58:22.780
<v Speaker 2>There needs to be a differentiation </v>
<v Speaker 2>between that.</v>

1173
00:58:22.781 --> 00:58:24.940
<v Speaker 2>And there was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that case Josh didn't get,</v>

1174
00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:27.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the full penalty of what was,</v>

1175
00:58:28.030 --> 00:58:29.380
<v Speaker 2>what that substance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1176
00:58:29.381 --> 00:58:30.214
<v Speaker 2>would have rendered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he did have to go through a long </v>

1177
00:58:31.991 --> 00:58:33.850
<v Speaker 2>period of time where he was unable to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>

1178
00:58:34.450 --> 00:58:35.570
<v Speaker 2>He did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

1179
00:58:35.620 --> 00:58:36.453
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had the prohibited substance in his </v>

1180
00:58:38.111 --> 00:58:38.890
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>

1181
00:58:38.890 --> 00:58:40.130
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you saw it,</v>

1182
00:58:40.131 --> 00:58:41.230
<v Speaker 2>it has to look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1183
00:58:41.350 --> 00:58:43.630
<v Speaker 2>even though you did that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't do that on purpose,</v>

1184
00:58:43.690 --> 00:58:46.180
<v Speaker 2>did that give you a performance </v>
<v Speaker 2>enhancing benefit?</v>

1185
00:58:46.210 --> 00:58:48.190
<v Speaker 2>Did it allow you to recover a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 2>better?</v>

1186
00:58:48.191 --> 00:58:51.340
<v Speaker 2>Did it make you a little bit stronger?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1187
00:58:51.341 --> 00:58:54.190
<v Speaker 2>that's why those strict liability </v>
<v Speaker 2>provisions are in there.</v>

1188
00:58:54.220 --> 00:58:56.980
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise people would just take these </v>
<v Speaker 2>prohibited supplements and say,</v>

1189
00:58:56.981 --> 00:58:57.814
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know exactly it was an </v>

1190
00:58:58.691 --> 00:59:00.020
<v Speaker 2>accident.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>

1191
00:59:00.070 --> 00:59:00.903
<v Speaker 2>they're getting a benefit for exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they have to have some sort of </v>

1192
00:59:03.191 --> 00:59:05.020
<v Speaker 2>penalty in place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so,</v>

1193
00:59:05.050 --> 00:59:06.490
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also think,</v>

1194
00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:07.353
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there needs to be a differentiation </v>

1195
00:59:09.461 --> 00:59:13.060
<v Speaker 2>between the intentional non-intentional </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we do have that in our policy.</v>

1196
00:59:13.061 --> 00:59:13.894
<v Speaker 2>There are definitely mitigating factors </v>
<v Speaker 2>available in our policy that if you </v>

1197
00:59:17.021 --> 00:59:19.120
<v Speaker 2>didn't do thing on purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not,</v>

1198
00:59:19.150 --> 00:59:19.983
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not sanctioned as tim means is a </v>

1199
00:59:21.141 --> 00:59:21.950
<v Speaker 2>great example there.</v>

1200
00:59:21.950 --> 00:59:25.310
<v Speaker 2>So Tim means use a relatively benign </v>
<v Speaker 2>supplement.</v>

1201
00:59:25.311 --> 00:59:27.510
<v Speaker 2>It was a creatine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>creatine,</v>

1202
00:59:27.550 --> 00:59:30.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>generally doesn't have an issue as,</v>

1203
00:59:30.361 --> 00:59:31.194
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as opposed like testosterone booster </v>

1204
00:59:32.691 --> 00:59:33.524
<v Speaker 2>supplements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We tell our athletes stay away from </v>

1205
00:59:35.511 --> 00:59:38.300
<v Speaker 2>anything marketing as a testosterone </v>
<v Speaker 2>booster.</v>

1206
00:59:38.301 --> 00:59:39.134
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the most common with </v>
<v Speaker 2>contaminants are purposely spiking </v>

1207
00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:45.470
<v Speaker 2>purposeful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Spikings two means uses a Korea 10.</v>

1208
00:59:45.800 --> 00:59:49.130
<v Speaker 2>It had a asta and in a very small </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount,</v>

1209
00:59:49.430 --> 00:59:50.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we founded in there,</v>

1210
00:59:50.810 --> 00:59:53.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Austrian has to your sanction.</v>

1211
00:59:53.060 --> 00:59:55.610
<v Speaker 2>He got six months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1212
00:59:55.760 --> 00:59:57.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so back relatively quickly.</v>

1213
00:59:57.501 --> 00:59:59.420
<v Speaker 2>So I think that's the thing with Yoel </v>
<v Speaker 2>Romero.</v>

1214
01:00:00.170 --> 01:00:01.003
<v Speaker 2>So correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yoel Romero used a natural diuretic </v>

1215
01:00:03.261 --> 01:00:05.540
<v Speaker 2>product that had um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a SAR minute.</v>

1216
01:00:05.890 --> 01:00:08.060
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all of these cases,</v>

1217
01:00:08.420 --> 01:00:13.420
<v Speaker 2>not only does the prohibited substance </v>
<v Speaker 2>need to show up and with the athlete has</v>

1218
01:00:13.491 --> 01:00:14.324
<v Speaker 2>says they've used ready but to protect </v>
<v Speaker 2>against making sure the athlete isn't </v>

1219
01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:19.310
<v Speaker 2>purposely spiking it.</v>

1220
01:00:19.610 --> 01:00:21.350
<v Speaker 2>You saw it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll go out on their own,</v>

1221
01:00:21.590 --> 01:00:24.110
<v Speaker 2>on the market,</v>
<v Speaker 2>independently procure,</v>

1222
01:00:24.111 --> 01:00:27.950
<v Speaker 2>hopefully the same lot of product.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in the case of eol and Tim,</v>

1223
01:00:28.190 --> 01:00:29.023
<v Speaker 2>they were able to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>test it completely independently of the </v>

1224
01:00:31.161 --> 01:00:31.994
<v Speaker 2>athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 2>determine what level the prohibited </v>

1225
01:00:33.681 --> 01:00:34.514
<v Speaker 2>substances in that based on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>interview with the athlete of how much </v>

1226
01:00:37.431 --> 01:00:38.264
<v Speaker 2>did you use,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when's the last time you used it </v>

1227
01:00:39.561 --> 01:00:43.760
<v Speaker 2>relative to this test?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do the science calculations just to make</v>

1228
01:00:43.761 --> 01:00:44.594
<v Speaker 2>sure an athlete's not saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I know this Korea tennis spiked </v>

1229
01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:49.760
<v Speaker 2>with fostering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm going to go use Austrian.</v>

1230
01:00:50.150 --> 01:00:53.810
<v Speaker 2>And then I have a built in excuse when I</v>
<v Speaker 2>test positive for Australian in order to</v>

1231
01:00:53.811 --> 01:00:57.740
<v Speaker 2>be able to match contaminant levels with</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's being excreted in the urine,</v>

1232
01:00:57.741 --> 01:01:02.480
<v Speaker 2>you would literally have to have phd </v>
<v Speaker 2>chemistry degree and I'm not aware of of</v>

1233
01:01:02.481 --> 01:01:04.220
<v Speaker 2>any our athletes have in that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be very,</v>

1234
01:01:04.221 --> 01:01:05.450
<v Speaker 2>very difficult to do that.</v>

1235
01:01:05.630 --> 01:01:08.810
<v Speaker 2>And so these detection levels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again we're talking about nanograms,</v>

1236
01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:10.970
<v Speaker 2>we're not talking about large </v>
<v Speaker 2>quantities.</v>

1237
01:01:10.971 --> 01:01:13.130
<v Speaker 2>That would be a pika grams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

1238
01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:17.990
<v Speaker 2>Now what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why was,</v>

1239
01:01:19.250 --> 01:01:24.250
<v Speaker 2>why was this moved from Vegas to </v>
<v Speaker 2>California and why?</v>

1240
01:01:24.590 --> 01:01:27.440
<v Speaker 2>Why did the California State Athletic </v>
<v Speaker 2>Commission,</v>

1241
01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:28.753
<v Speaker 2>why did they accept this fight taking </v>
<v Speaker 2>place here and why did Vegas say no to </v>

1242
01:01:32.571 --> 01:01:35.150
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So internally,</v>

1243
01:01:35.151 --> 01:01:36.770
<v Speaker 2>the UFC wise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we first,</v>

1244
01:01:36.771 --> 01:01:39.620
<v Speaker 2>in fact Donna Mark Illini who you know </v>
<v Speaker 2>who works with me,</v>

1245
01:01:39.740 --> 01:01:40.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're out to Donna.</v>

1246
01:01:40.970 --> 01:01:41.803
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're a two person shop and the woman's </v>

1247
01:01:44.151 --> 01:01:45.800
<v Speaker 2>a hawks and one of the hardest workers I</v>
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>

1248
01:01:45.801 --> 01:01:47.450
<v Speaker 2>So she's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's awesome.</v>

1249
01:01:47.570 --> 01:01:48.403
<v Speaker 2>She's taken a look at something that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have access to called the clearing </v>

1250
01:01:50.721 --> 01:01:51.554
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's basically a recording of all </v>

1251
01:01:54.081 --> 01:01:56.180
<v Speaker 2>the tests on our athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we can get on there.</v>

1252
01:01:56.181 --> 01:01:57.110
<v Speaker 2>Somebody says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1253
01:01:57.111 --> 01:01:59.510
<v Speaker 2>how many times was John Tested last </v>
<v Speaker 2>quarter?</v>

1254
01:01:59.900 --> 01:02:01.670
<v Speaker 2>We can get on there and pull that up.</v>

1255
01:02:02.150 --> 01:02:04.850
<v Speaker 2>The public also has access to our </v>
<v Speaker 2>testing records,</v>

1256
01:02:04.851 --> 01:02:07.490
<v Speaker 2>not with a specificity that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>clearinghouse has,</v>

1257
01:02:07.491 --> 01:02:11.420
<v Speaker 2>but the public can get on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you saw it on a weekly basis.</v>

1258
01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:12.583
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>updates how many tests and athletes </v>

1259
01:02:14.811 --> 01:02:15.890
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's some of these,</v>

1260
01:02:16.420 --> 01:02:17.253
<v Speaker 2>some guys out there on the Internet from</v>
<v Speaker 2>the day one of the program have kept </v>

1261
01:02:20.011 --> 01:02:22.080
<v Speaker 2>track of what week they're numbers tick </v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

1262
01:02:22.081 --> 01:02:24.030
<v Speaker 2>So you can go find spreadsheets on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Internet,</v>

1263
01:02:24.031 --> 01:02:27.420
<v Speaker 2>at least from a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from a weekly basis of when our athletes</v>

1264
01:02:27.421 --> 01:02:29.280
<v Speaker 2>were tested and how many times every </v>
<v Speaker 2>week.</v>

1265
01:02:29.370 --> 01:02:30.870
<v Speaker 2>God bless those dorks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>

1266
01:02:30.871 --> 01:02:31.704
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the clearing house program is very </v>

1267
01:02:34.891 --> 01:02:35.724
<v Speaker 2>specific.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can get on there and see the actual </v>

1268
01:02:36.871 --> 01:02:40.740
<v Speaker 2>date of the collection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And next to that we see negative,</v>

1269
01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:45.270
<v Speaker 2>positive or pending.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Donna came to me late November,</v>

1270
01:02:45.271 --> 01:02:46.410
<v Speaker 2>early December saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1271
01:02:46.411 --> 01:02:47.244
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking at John's tests and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing pending still back from I think </v>

1272
01:02:52.531 --> 01:02:54.060
<v Speaker 2>was maybe August,</v>
<v Speaker 2>September,</v>

1273
01:02:54.950 --> 01:02:56.280
<v Speaker 2>thinks something's going on here.</v>

1274
01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:57.480
<v Speaker 2>And of course I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1275
01:02:57.481 --> 01:02:59.550
<v Speaker 2>well he's fighting pretty soon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope not,</v>

1276
01:02:59.551 --> 01:03:03.310
<v Speaker 2>but let me reach out to you Sada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I reached out to them.</v>

1277
01:03:03.340 --> 01:03:05.610
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're working on something.</v>

1278
01:03:05.611 --> 01:03:06.280
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1279
01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:07.113
<v Speaker 2>conducting a study.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're talking to other professional </v>

1280
01:03:08.551 --> 01:03:09.384
<v Speaker 2>sports leagues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're talking to the laboratories out </v>

1281
01:03:10.861 --> 01:03:13.490
<v Speaker 2>there and don't have an answer for you </v>
<v Speaker 2>now that,</v>

1282
01:03:13.550 --> 01:03:16.230
<v Speaker 2>but stand by.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think it was September,</v>

1283
01:03:16.590 --> 01:03:20.430
<v Speaker 2>December six,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they sent a letter to us and they sent a</v>

1284
01:03:20.431 --> 01:03:23.640
<v Speaker 2>letter to the Nevada state athletic </v>
<v Speaker 2>commission saying,</v>

1285
01:03:24.030 --> 01:03:27.090
<v Speaker 2>just so you're aware,</v>
<v Speaker 2>over the last six months,</v>

1286
01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:29.070
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>early in this six months,</v>

1287
01:03:29.071 --> 01:03:32.050
<v Speaker 2>we've seen a reemergence of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>longterm metabolite,</v>

1288
01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:34.350
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in John's samples,</v>

1289
01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:37.350
<v Speaker 2>we've always was this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this was early December,</v>

1290
01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:38.213
<v Speaker 2>December 6th,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we and the Nevada Athletic Commission </v>

1291
01:03:40.861 --> 01:03:42.660
<v Speaker 2>were notified.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were notified,</v>

1292
01:03:42.661 --> 01:03:45.180
<v Speaker 2>but the test was from previous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the tests,</v>

1293
01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:47.130
<v Speaker 2>these tests,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1294
01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:52.190
<v Speaker 2>covered from August through November.</v>

1295
01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:53.993
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's [inaudible] test several of </v>

1296
01:03:55.651 --> 01:03:56.310
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1297
01:03:56.310 --> 01:03:59.220
<v Speaker 2>some more than one test show this </v>
<v Speaker 2>metabolite.</v>

1298
01:03:59.221 --> 01:04:04.080
<v Speaker 2>So what they said was August 9th,</v>
<v Speaker 2>negative August 29th,</v>

1299
01:04:04.110 --> 01:04:09.110
<v Speaker 2>eight picograms September 18th,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight eight September 18th.</v>

1300
01:04:09.421 --> 01:04:10.950
<v Speaker 2>So I mean there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a good,</v>

1301
01:04:11.820 --> 01:04:14.850
<v Speaker 2>so he's negative on the ninth 20 days </v>
<v Speaker 2>later.</v>

1302
01:04:14.851 --> 01:04:17.970
<v Speaker 2>So inside the 22 checkups,</v>
<v Speaker 2>22 day window,</v>

1303
01:04:18.090 --> 01:04:21.900
<v Speaker 2>he shows an eight peak gram,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no short term metabolites,</v>

1304
01:04:21.930 --> 01:04:23.700
<v Speaker 2>no longterm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no parent,</v>

1305
01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:25.350
<v Speaker 2>no medium term,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no medium.</v>

1306
01:04:25.351 --> 01:04:26.184
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No media.</v>

1307
01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:27.420
<v Speaker 2>Only longterm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

1308
01:04:28.050 --> 01:04:31.110
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we then go to the 18th of September,</v>

1309
01:04:31.170 --> 01:04:35.820
<v Speaker 2>19 Pika grams and then that's followed </v>
<v Speaker 2>by four negative tests.</v>

1310
01:04:36.090 --> 01:04:39.690
<v Speaker 2>September 21st,</v>
<v Speaker 2>October 2nd,</v>

1311
01:04:40.140 --> 01:04:43.860
<v Speaker 2>October 11th and November 14th.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So at this point,</v>

1312
01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:45.960
<v Speaker 2>late November,</v>
<v Speaker 2>early December,</v>

1313
01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:47.640
<v Speaker 2>you saw it and says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1314
01:04:48.090 --> 01:04:51.690
<v Speaker 2>we've done our studying those two low </v>
<v Speaker 2>levels in August,</v>

1315
01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:53.273
<v Speaker 2>our residual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no evidence of any readminister </v>

1316
01:04:55.511 --> 01:04:58.740
<v Speaker 2>ration based on lack of short and medium</v>
<v Speaker 2>term and parent.</v>

1317
01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:00.073
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>based on our consultation with other </v>

1318
01:05:01.231 --> 01:05:03.330
<v Speaker 2>leagues with these labs that are seeing </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1319
01:05:03.660 --> 01:05:04.493
<v Speaker 2>we're calling this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is would be double jeopardy if we </v>

1320
01:05:06.241 --> 01:05:07.050
<v Speaker 2>did them again.</v>

1321
01:05:07.050 --> 01:05:07.883
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is awesome.</v>

1322
01:05:08.190 --> 01:05:09.023
<v Speaker 2>This is something that should be really </v>
<v Speaker 2>emphasized because there's a lot of </v>

1323
01:05:10.921 --> 01:05:14.070
<v Speaker 2>people that don't understand this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not just this one test.</v>

1324
01:05:14.430 --> 01:05:15.263
<v Speaker 2>These are many tasks that have been done</v>
<v Speaker 2>over course of John's suspension and </v>

1325
01:05:19.601 --> 01:05:20.434
<v Speaker 2>then ultimately relicensing that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>showing this exact same metabolite at a </v>

1326
01:05:24.371 --> 01:05:27.910
<v Speaker 2>very similar level that according to </v>
<v Speaker 2>previous tests,</v>

1327
01:05:27.911 --> 01:05:28.744
<v Speaker 2>specifically on Clomiphene,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this could be this pulsing correct </v>

1328
01:05:32.711 --> 01:05:33.544
<v Speaker 2>result of existing and not existing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this is not indicative in any way </v>

1329
01:05:38.651 --> 01:05:41.920
<v Speaker 2>that can be provable of microdosing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

1330
01:05:42.130 --> 01:05:44.020
<v Speaker 2>And not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is over.</v>

1331
01:05:44.021 --> 01:05:47.350
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about this being over long</v>
<v Speaker 2>term,</v>

1332
01:05:47.470 --> 01:05:49.660
<v Speaker 2>long periods of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many months.</v>

1333
01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:53.140
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And consistent numbers over many months.</v>

1334
01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:54.730
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>

1335
01:05:54.731 --> 01:05:57.850
<v Speaker 2>going back to what one expert Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bauer said,</v>

1336
01:05:57.851 --> 01:05:59.710
<v Speaker 2>you've gotta be careful what you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about.</v>

1337
01:05:59.890 --> 01:06:02.110
<v Speaker 2>He's single and double wall number,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grams.</v>

1338
01:06:02.111 --> 01:06:03.130
<v Speaker 2>And you see some bearings.</v>

1339
01:06:03.130 --> 01:06:03.963
<v Speaker 2>You gotta be careful about saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it went from nine to 18 that means </v>

1340
01:06:06.611 --> 01:06:08.200
<v Speaker 2>re administration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1341
01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:11.620
<v Speaker 2>it's inexact science at that level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The water labs,</v>

1342
01:06:11.820 --> 01:06:16.510
<v Speaker 2>this is a non threshold substance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all water requires them to say,</v>

1343
01:06:16.511 --> 01:06:19.750
<v Speaker 2>to report back to water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>positive or negative.</v>

1344
01:06:19.751 --> 01:06:22.300
<v Speaker 2>They're not required to quantify.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

1345
01:06:22.301 --> 01:06:23.134
<v Speaker 2>these water labs have also realized </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an issue when you're getting </v>

1346
01:06:25.481 --> 01:06:26.314
<v Speaker 2>under Pika grams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what they're doing is going back </v>

1347
01:06:29.410 --> 01:06:30.910
<v Speaker 2>after reporting the positive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1348
01:06:30.911 --> 01:06:35.020
<v Speaker 2>let's see if we can estimate with this </v>
<v Speaker 2>level is it's an inexact science at Pika</v>

1349
01:06:35.021 --> 01:06:38.410
<v Speaker 2>gram quantities in my understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1350
01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:39.273
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1351
01:06:39.350 --> 01:06:41.230
<v Speaker 2>estimate what those levels are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1352
01:06:41.231 --> 01:06:42.064
<v Speaker 2>You can see some variations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Nevada is unwilling to sanction the </v>

1353
01:06:47.921 --> 01:06:50.470
<v Speaker 2>fight based on all this information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they get,</v>

1354
01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:53.230
<v Speaker 2>they get the initial notice that we got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>

1355
01:06:53.231 --> 01:06:55.480
<v Speaker 2>I think it was December six saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1356
01:06:55.990 --> 01:06:57.790
<v Speaker 2>there was an issue in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in August,</v>

1357
01:06:57.791 --> 01:07:00.070
<v Speaker 2>these longterm metabolites reappeared </v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

1358
01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:04.720
<v Speaker 2>But we've since had four negative tests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't believe that the August,</v>

1359
01:07:04.780 --> 01:07:07.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reappearance is a re administration.</v>

1360
01:07:07.450 --> 01:07:09.700
<v Speaker 2>There's no sanction here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nevada,</v>

1361
01:07:09.701 --> 01:07:12.310
<v Speaker 2>you don't even have jurisdiction over </v>
<v Speaker 2>the August tests.</v>

1362
01:07:12.340 --> 01:07:13.180
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep in mind,</v>

1363
01:07:13.181 --> 01:07:15.760
<v Speaker 2>these are UFC tests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nevada doesn't mandate it,</v>

1364
01:07:16.090 --> 01:07:18.070
<v Speaker 2>but Nevada says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look closer to a fight.</v>

1365
01:07:18.071 --> 01:07:21.340
<v Speaker 2>We do take jurisdiction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We will adopt these Usada tests.</v>

1366
01:07:21.790 --> 01:07:23.410
<v Speaker 2>So you saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It didn't need to,</v>

1367
01:07:23.470 --> 01:07:24.430
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to notify.</v>

1368
01:07:24.431 --> 01:07:26.290
<v Speaker 2>They thought out of an abundance of </v>
<v Speaker 2>caution,</v>

1369
01:07:26.291 --> 01:07:29.260
<v Speaker 2>let's let Nevada know that this issue </v>
<v Speaker 2>exists.</v>

1370
01:07:29.390 --> 01:07:32.170
<v Speaker 2>God Damn saw what the fuck they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey wait,</v>

1371
01:07:32.171 --> 01:07:33.100
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's all good.</v>

1372
01:07:33.101 --> 01:07:33.761
<v Speaker 2>And you saw it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good,</v>

1373
01:07:33.761 --> 01:07:34.780
<v Speaker 2>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gets this.</v>

1374
01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:35.890
<v Speaker 2>I talk with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

1375
01:07:35.891 --> 01:07:36.790
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

1376
01:07:37.180 --> 01:07:38.013
<v Speaker 2>this is concerning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we don't see anything within our </v>

1377
01:07:39.461 --> 01:07:40.294
<v Speaker 2>jurisdiction here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I certainly hope that no subsequent </v>

1378
01:07:43.781 --> 01:07:46.810
<v Speaker 2>tests show up positive because that </v>
<v Speaker 2>could be an issue.</v>

1379
01:07:46.810 --> 01:07:47.643
<v Speaker 2>And sure enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you sought it collects a sample from </v>

1380
01:07:50.111 --> 01:07:51.580
<v Speaker 2>John on 12,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nine.</v>

1381
01:07:52.090 --> 01:07:52.923
<v Speaker 2>They expedited the results cause they </v>
<v Speaker 2>knew a fight was coming up and they do </v>

1382
01:07:55.211 --> 01:07:59.380
<v Speaker 2>that now when fights or close or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>collections are done close to a fight,</v>

1383
01:07:59.830 --> 01:08:00.790
<v Speaker 2>and here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1384
01:08:00.791 --> 01:08:03.040
<v Speaker 2>he pulses back up to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1385
01:08:03.220 --> 01:08:05.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>between 60 and 80 pika grams.</v>

1386
01:08:06.490 --> 01:08:08.500
<v Speaker 2>So Nevada gets this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1387
01:08:08.501 --> 01:08:09.520
<v Speaker 2>this was last week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1388
01:08:09.521 --> 01:08:12.100
<v Speaker 2>the days of run together for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1389
01:08:12.150 --> 01:08:13.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a week ago,</v>

1390
01:08:13.631 --> 01:08:15.770
<v Speaker 2>Friday we have in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1391
01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:17.660
<v Speaker 2>Bob Bennett who's the executive </v>
<v Speaker 2>director.</v>

1392
01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:20.900
<v Speaker 2>While I'm a big fan of these great guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>out in Nevada,</v>

1393
01:08:20.901 --> 01:08:23.680
<v Speaker 2>but I remember FBI agent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we got it done around.</v>

1394
01:08:23.780 --> 01:08:24.613
<v Speaker 2>He is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's one of the reasons why it probably </v>

1395
01:08:27.231 --> 01:08:28.064
<v Speaker 2>wasn't sanctioned in Nevada was because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're so by the book I get angry </v>

1396
01:08:30.591 --> 01:08:32.000
<v Speaker 2>because I wanted to fight to be in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nevada.</v>

1397
01:08:32.001 --> 01:08:34.010
<v Speaker 2>But I understand Bob's position.</v>

1398
01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:35.150
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Implicitly.</v>

1399
01:08:35.380 --> 01:08:37.040
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let me make clear what happened.</v>

1400
01:08:37.190 --> 01:08:38.870
<v Speaker 2>Bob came in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anthony Martin Marinell,</v>

1401
01:08:38.900 --> 01:08:39.733
<v Speaker 2>the chairman of the commission came in </v>
<v Speaker 2>and a couple representatives from the </v>

1402
01:08:42.590 --> 01:08:43.423
<v Speaker 2>Nevada attorney general's office.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they are the ones that prosecute </v>

1403
01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:50.870
<v Speaker 2>cases involving ped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you said violates Nevada regs.</v>

1404
01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:54.800
<v Speaker 2>So we share all this with them and lists</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you did with me.</v>

1405
01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:56.450
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Share it all with them.</v>

1406
01:08:56.840 --> 01:08:58.580
<v Speaker 2>And look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some misconception out there.</v>

1407
01:08:58.581 --> 01:09:02.330
<v Speaker 2>They did not say this fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely not happening next week.</v>

1408
01:09:02.870 --> 01:09:04.580
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1409
01:09:04.700 --> 01:09:07.070
<v Speaker 2>I think we're understanding these </v>
<v Speaker 2>issues,</v>

1410
01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:08.090
<v Speaker 2>but said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1411
01:09:08.091 --> 01:09:12.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>optically this doesn't look great and we</v>

1412
01:09:12.261 --> 01:09:13.094
<v Speaker 2>feel that out of an abundance of caution</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we need to have a public hearing </v>

1413
01:09:17.270 --> 01:09:20.780
<v Speaker 2>and be very transparent about this cause</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

1414
01:09:21.290 --> 01:09:23.690
<v Speaker 2>this is some weird shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1415
01:09:24.170 --> 01:09:26.690
<v Speaker 2>this was last Friday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're eight days out from the fight.</v>

1416
01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:27.501
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1417
01:09:27.501 --> 01:09:28.640
<v Speaker 2>we start talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1418
01:09:28.641 --> 01:09:30.710
<v Speaker 2>when can we potentially have this?</v>

1419
01:09:30.740 --> 01:09:33.650
<v Speaker 2>And unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christmas holiday,</v>

1420
01:09:34.070 --> 01:09:36.890
<v Speaker 2>several of the commissioners weren't </v>
<v Speaker 2>even in town.</v>

1421
01:09:37.370 --> 01:09:39.590
<v Speaker 2>And basically what they said is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1422
01:09:39.740 --> 01:09:42.290
<v Speaker 2>we will absolutely do this if you want </v>
<v Speaker 2>us to,</v>

1423
01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:46.100
<v Speaker 2>but likely that hearing would not be </v>
<v Speaker 2>until today,</v>

1424
01:09:46.100 --> 01:09:47.540
<v Speaker 2>Thursday or maybe tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Friday.</v>

1425
01:09:47.990 --> 01:09:49.880
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Marinello is like,</v>

1426
01:09:49.881 --> 01:09:50.480
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1427
01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:52.790
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm starting to get my head around this,</v>

1428
01:09:53.150 --> 01:09:53.983
<v Speaker 2>but I can't guarantee you that my other </v>
<v Speaker 2>commissioners or me are going to come </v>

1429
01:09:57.441 --> 01:09:59.120
<v Speaker 2>out the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're taking,</v>

1430
01:09:59.470 --> 01:10:01.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're taking a chance here that,</v>

1431
01:10:01.310 --> 01:10:02.390
<v Speaker 2>that we could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1432
01:10:02.420 --> 01:10:04.670
<v Speaker 2>we need more information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1433
01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:07.730
<v Speaker 2>so basically they were willing to listen</v>
<v Speaker 2>to it.</v>

1434
01:10:07.940 --> 01:10:10.310
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they were starting to wrap their</v>

1435
01:10:10.311 --> 01:10:11.144
<v Speaker 2>heads around it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but didn't feel that they were up to </v>

1436
01:10:13.041 --> 01:10:13.874
<v Speaker 2>speed enough on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't have the luxury that Andy </v>

1437
01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:19.033
<v Speaker 2>Foster and California have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember when John tested positive in </v>

1438
01:10:21.741 --> 01:10:22.574
<v Speaker 2>July,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2018 that fight was in California </v>

1439
01:10:25.940 --> 01:10:30.170
<v Speaker 2>because that fight was in California,</v>
<v Speaker 2>California retained jurisdiction.</v>

1440
01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:34.280
<v Speaker 2>They've had two very public hearings on </v>
<v Speaker 2>John when they suspended his license.</v>

1441
01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:35.473
<v Speaker 2>And most recently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a week and a half ago when they </v>

1442
01:10:36.741 --> 01:10:40.250
<v Speaker 2>reinstated his license.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Andy and the commission,</v>

1443
01:10:40.490 --> 01:10:43.340
<v Speaker 2>we're very familiar with the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>termina ball.</v>

1444
01:10:43.670 --> 01:10:46.730
<v Speaker 2>They were very familiar with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>longterm metabolite.</v>

1445
01:10:47.180 --> 01:10:51.590
<v Speaker 2>And in fact Andy was somewhat critical </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Usada during the last hearing.</v>

1446
01:10:51.860 --> 01:10:55.400
<v Speaker 2>He thought after looking at all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>details after reading,</v>

1447
01:10:55.740 --> 01:10:56.573
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mclaren's a position that there was no </v>

1448
01:10:58.581 --> 01:11:01.700
<v Speaker 2>evidence that this was done on purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He thought,</v>

1449
01:11:01.701 --> 01:11:02.534
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe they went a little bit hard on </v>

1450
01:11:03.591 --> 01:11:04.970
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he stated that in that,</v>

1451
01:11:04.971 --> 01:11:09.971
<v Speaker 2>in that second hearing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So with the reemergence of the Pika gram</v>

1452
01:11:10.161 --> 01:11:14.490
<v Speaker 2>quantity of this m three longterm </v>
<v Speaker 2>metabolite Andy in the commission,</v>

1453
01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:17.760
<v Speaker 2>unlike Nevada,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't need to get up to speed on it.</v>

1454
01:11:17.761 --> 01:11:20.940
<v Speaker 2>They've already had two public hearings </v>
<v Speaker 2>on John's issue.</v>

1455
01:11:21.150 --> 01:11:23.700
<v Speaker 2>They were intimately familiar with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1456
01:11:23.730 --> 01:11:27.330
<v Speaker 2>some of these dynamics of this drug and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the metabolites and,</v>

1457
01:11:27.390 --> 01:11:31.770
<v Speaker 2>and that's why he felt comfortable based</v>
<v Speaker 2>on their familiarization with it.</v>

1458
01:11:31.770 --> 01:11:36.360
<v Speaker 2>And based on these written absolute </v>
<v Speaker 2>statements by these experts.</v>

1459
01:11:36.361 --> 01:11:37.194
<v Speaker 2>So there was no ray ingestion one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the second thing which we </v>

1460
01:11:39.931 --> 01:11:44.130
<v Speaker 2>haven't covered is these experts said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>based on these low level Pika grams,</v>

1461
01:11:44.131 --> 01:11:46.350
<v Speaker 2>there's no performance enhancing </v>
<v Speaker 2>benefit.</v>

1462
01:11:46.830 --> 01:11:51.420
<v Speaker 2>And that's an important point because if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would have told you fc look,</v>

1463
01:11:51.570 --> 01:11:54.960
<v Speaker 2>this is still remnants from a year and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>half ago,</v>

1464
01:11:55.350 --> 01:11:56.183
<v Speaker 2>but we can't rule out that he's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting a performance enhancing benefit </v>

1465
01:11:59.431 --> 01:12:01.320
<v Speaker 2>from it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well in that instance,</v>

1466
01:12:01.321 --> 01:12:03.040
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know I,</v>

1467
01:12:03.090 --> 01:12:03.923
<v Speaker 2>I stand by this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I w I would leave this company if </v>

1468
01:12:05.881 --> 01:12:06.714
<v Speaker 2>somebody told me otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there was any indication that there </v>

1469
01:12:09.181 --> 01:12:10.014
<v Speaker 2>would be a benefit from him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though it technically wasn't a </v>

1470
01:12:11.971 --> 01:12:12.804
<v Speaker 2>violation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to stand by while anybody </v>

1471
01:12:15.241 --> 01:12:18.180
<v Speaker 2>licenses that guy to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could it been,</v>

1472
01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:23.240
<v Speaker 2>could this have been somehow or another </v>
<v Speaker 2>mitigated by communicating these results</v>

1473
01:12:25.541 --> 01:12:26.790
<v Speaker 2>to Nevada earlier?</v>

1474
01:12:27.930 --> 01:12:29.370
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we didn't announce the fight.</v>

1475
01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:33.570
<v Speaker 2>The John was going to fight and in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nevada and tell October,</v>

1476
01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:36.210
<v Speaker 2>but in October,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you have said,</v>

1477
01:12:36.211 --> 01:12:37.680
<v Speaker 2>hey look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's this issue.</v>

1478
01:12:37.700 --> 01:12:39.550
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Potentially buy.</v>

1479
01:12:39.551 --> 01:12:42.480
<v Speaker 2>But the issue was you saw to hadn't come</v>
<v Speaker 2>to that.</v>

1480
01:12:42.481 --> 01:12:43.314
<v Speaker 2>They were in the middle of that point of</v>
<v Speaker 2>consulting with other professional </v>

1481
01:12:46.801 --> 01:12:49.440
<v Speaker 2>sports leagues with the other water </v>
<v Speaker 2>labs.</v>

1482
01:12:49.441 --> 01:12:53.460
<v Speaker 2>They hadn't reached their conclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their science expert hadn't determined,</v>

1483
01:12:53.730 --> 01:12:55.560
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is definitely residual,</v>

1484
01:12:55.561 --> 01:12:56.394
<v Speaker 2>no performance dancing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were still going through that data </v>

1485
01:12:58.261 --> 01:13:00.630
<v Speaker 2>at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what they've told me is,</v>

1486
01:13:00.631 --> 01:13:01.080
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1487
01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:03.360
<v Speaker 2>we tried to hurry that along as fast as </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>

1488
01:13:03.361 --> 01:13:05.490
<v Speaker 2>We wanted to make sure that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1489
01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:07.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we went through this and very,</v>

1490
01:13:07.110 --> 01:13:09.510
<v Speaker 2>very detailed and no stone left </v>
<v Speaker 2>unturned.</v>

1491
01:13:09.630 --> 01:13:10.463
<v Speaker 2>When,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when did they reach this conclusion </v>

1492
01:13:11.970 --> 01:13:13.410
<v Speaker 2>does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this was early December,</v>

1493
01:13:13.411 --> 01:13:14.244
<v Speaker 2>so December six that letter went out </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying we've had these two low level </v>

1494
01:13:17.101 --> 01:13:18.660
<v Speaker 2>positives back in August.</v>

1495
01:13:18.820 --> 01:13:20.010
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But here we are.</v>

1496
01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:21.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the end of December.</v>

1497
01:13:21.930 --> 01:13:25.380
<v Speaker 2>What could this have been headed off at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the pass?</v>

1498
01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:26.191
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1499
01:13:26.191 --> 01:13:29.520
<v Speaker 2>when Nevada first got notified,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they thought like,</v>

1500
01:13:29.521 --> 01:13:30.600
<v Speaker 2>we were hoping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1501
01:13:30.601 --> 01:13:31.434
<v Speaker 2>he's had four negative tests,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he's probably going to be negative </v>

1502
01:13:33.931 --> 01:13:35.340
<v Speaker 2>going forward here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1503
01:13:35.370 --> 01:13:36.203
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what,</v>

1504
01:13:36.250 --> 01:13:37.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lay person would think,</v>

1505
01:13:37.651 --> 01:13:39.540
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's probably out of the woods now.</v>

1506
01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:41.160
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1507
01:13:41.161 --> 01:13:41.994
<v Speaker 2>getting back to what period of time is </v>
<v Speaker 2>this and John's preparation and if you </v>

1508
01:13:45.751 --> 01:13:46.584
<v Speaker 2>look at some of these numbers and when </v>
<v Speaker 2>these metabolites appear and disappear </v>

1509
01:13:50.970 --> 01:13:51.803
<v Speaker 2>in early August,</v>
<v Speaker 2>John was preparing his defense for this </v>

1510
01:13:54.631 --> 01:13:55.464
<v Speaker 2>arbitration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he had an idea based on talking </v>

1511
01:13:57.631 --> 01:13:58.740
<v Speaker 2>to his attorneys like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1512
01:13:59.310 --> 01:14:00.143
<v Speaker 2>we've got a pretty good shot here of </v>
<v Speaker 2>some mitigating factors where this is </v>

1513
01:14:02.941 --> 01:14:05.100
<v Speaker 2>potentially going to get reduced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think,</v>

1514
01:14:05.730 --> 01:14:07.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he starts to get a little bit motivated,</v>

1515
01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:08.513
<v Speaker 2>gets in the gym,</v>
<v Speaker 2>start training again clearly in early </v>

1516
01:14:11.890 --> 01:14:11.920
<v Speaker 2>December.</v>

1517
01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:12.753
<v Speaker 2>That's a period of time when our </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighters that close to a fight are </v>

1518
01:14:15.701 --> 01:14:17.830
<v Speaker 2>bringing down that body weight right </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

1519
01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:19.600
<v Speaker 2>cutting body fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're losing,</v>

1520
01:14:19.630 --> 01:14:20.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit of water.</v>

1521
01:14:21.370 --> 01:14:24.010
<v Speaker 2>So it certainly seems to correlate </v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

1522
01:14:24.011 --> 01:14:25.420
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these pulsing,</v>

1523
01:14:25.450 --> 01:14:27.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>affects with when is just theoretical,</v>

1524
01:14:27.791 --> 01:14:29.500
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That it's released from adipose tissue.</v>

1525
01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:30.393
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

1526
01:14:30.610 --> 01:14:31.580
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1527
01:14:31.630 --> 01:14:36.630
<v Speaker 2>this positive result was announced when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so a week ago yesterday as you saw it as</v>

1528
01:14:41.021 --> 01:14:41.740
<v Speaker 2>announced,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you saw,</v>

1529
01:14:41.740 --> 01:14:42.573
<v Speaker 2>it notifies us the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That always happens and they notify if </v>

1530
01:14:45.911 --> 01:14:48.250
<v Speaker 2>any commission has jurisdiction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At this point,</v>

1531
01:14:48.251 --> 01:14:50.680
<v Speaker 2>this close to a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nevada has jurisdiction.</v>

1532
01:14:51.460 --> 01:14:56.460
<v Speaker 2>So I get the call and you can imagine </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going through my head.</v>

1533
01:14:57.160 --> 01:14:59.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've gotten so many of these calls now.</v>

1534
01:14:59.591 --> 01:15:02.080
<v Speaker 2>I literally for the first five or 10 </v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes,</v>

1535
01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:03.513
<v Speaker 2>can bury my head in my hand and think </v>
<v Speaker 2>through exactly how this thing's going </v>

1536
01:15:06.641 --> 01:15:09.640
<v Speaker 2>to play out and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be,</v>

1537
01:15:09.641 --> 01:15:11.110
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nevada is going to say,</v>

1538
01:15:11.470 --> 01:15:12.190
<v Speaker 2>wait a second.</v>

1539
01:15:12.190 --> 01:15:14.260
<v Speaker 2>What's going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need to root this out.</v>

1540
01:15:15.070 --> 01:15:17.560
<v Speaker 2>John's going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ,</v>

1541
01:15:17.561 --> 01:15:19.120
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is going on in my life?</v>

1542
01:15:19.121 --> 01:15:21.880
<v Speaker 2>I can't get a fucking break.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to be careful.</v>

1543
01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:26.350
<v Speaker 2>I even went through with DC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>DC's going to react and he reacts.</v>

1544
01:15:26.351 --> 01:15:29.140
<v Speaker 2>He's going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fucking told you this was the case.</v>

1545
01:15:29.141 --> 01:15:31.090
<v Speaker 2>This guy's a cheater.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1546
01:15:31.091 --> 01:15:33.370
<v Speaker 2>you saw it as bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Novitsky is bullshit.</v>

1547
01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:36.370
<v Speaker 2>All this stuff goes through my head and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the first five or 10 minutes,</v>

1548
01:15:36.371 --> 01:15:38.020
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how's Dana gonna React?</v>

1549
01:15:38.021 --> 01:15:38.854
<v Speaker 2>How's hundred are going to react when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to go over to his office and </v>

1550
01:15:41.020 --> 01:15:44.320
<v Speaker 2>explain this out to them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It played out exactly as I saw it.</v>

1551
01:15:44.321 --> 01:15:45.070
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1552
01:15:45.070 --> 01:15:48.100
<v Speaker 2>it's some of the worst days of my career</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I get these calls.</v>

1553
01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:50.620
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1554
01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:54.730
<v Speaker 2>every bone was notified in Nevada was in</v>
<v Speaker 2>our office two days later.</v>

1555
01:15:54.850 --> 01:15:55.683
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's been some criticism of </v>

1556
01:15:57.791 --> 01:15:59.650
<v Speaker 2>them out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1557
01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:00.753
<v Speaker 2>I don't fault them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a complicated issue that </v>

1558
01:16:02.620 --> 01:16:03.453
<v Speaker 2>optically doesn't look great and to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything in a rush manner would be </v>

1559
01:16:07.061 --> 01:16:09.940
<v Speaker 2>difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did everything they could to afford</v>

1560
01:16:09.941 --> 01:16:12.820
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Having a hearing problem was,</v>

1561
01:16:12.821 --> 01:16:14.550
<v Speaker 2>it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was too close to,</v>

1562
01:16:14.551 --> 01:16:19.551
<v Speaker 2>to a fight essentially to get this out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this issue with optics,</v>

1563
01:16:19.601 --> 01:16:21.610
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause if you go on twitter,</v>

1564
01:16:21.611 --> 01:16:24.130
<v Speaker 2>everybody's calling him a cheat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's saying that you know,</v>

1565
01:16:24.131 --> 01:16:24.964
<v Speaker 2>anybody that sanctions this is you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>sanctioning cheating for someone to get </v>

1566
01:16:30.251 --> 01:16:31.084
<v Speaker 2>an understanding of what this is like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It actually requires probably more than </v>

1567
01:16:34.151 --> 01:16:36.880
<v Speaker 2>we've done now over the last hour and 15</v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes.</v>

1568
01:16:36.910 --> 01:16:38.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I appreciate this forum.</v>

1569
01:16:38.651 --> 01:16:39.484
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dana and I went on sports center and </v>

1570
01:16:40.631 --> 01:16:42.870
<v Speaker 2>announced it in three minute hit and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>came out of there going,</v>

1571
01:16:42.940 --> 01:16:45.760
<v Speaker 2>absolutely everyone in the world is </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to say this is bullshit.</v>

1572
01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:47.390
<v Speaker 2>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what,</v>

1573
01:16:47.410 --> 01:16:50.110
<v Speaker 2>we're going to have a hard time doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>this in two hours here,</v>

1574
01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:51.640
<v Speaker 2>Mrs Things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1575
01:16:51.641 --> 01:16:52.474
<v Speaker 2>you've got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to delve into it and you've </v>

1576
01:16:54.011 --> 01:16:57.040
<v Speaker 2>also have to put your trust and reliance</v>
<v Speaker 2>on these experts.</v>

1577
01:16:57.041 --> 01:17:02.041
<v Speaker 2>They have a education professional </v>
<v Speaker 2>career of 20 to 25 years to come up with</v>

1578
01:17:03.131 --> 01:17:06.040
<v Speaker 2>these absolutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no one else in the world,</v>

1579
01:17:06.041 --> 01:17:09.860
<v Speaker 2>but maybe a dozen people that can come </v>
<v Speaker 2>up with these conclusions.</v>

1580
01:17:10.370 --> 01:17:11.660
<v Speaker 2>You do have to put your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1581
01:17:11.661 --> 01:17:12.494
<v Speaker 2>your faith and in their background and </v>
<v Speaker 2>their careers and their knowledge and </v>

1582
01:17:15.171 --> 01:17:19.070
<v Speaker 2>education and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a red which those absolutes were,</v>

1583
01:17:19.071 --> 01:17:21.560
<v Speaker 2>that there was no evidence of any read </v>
<v Speaker 2>ingestion.</v>

1584
01:17:21.561 --> 01:17:23.790
<v Speaker 2>This is by multiple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1585
01:17:23.810 --> 01:17:24.643
<v Speaker 2>experts and that John would not have </v>
<v Speaker 2>retained any performance benefit based </v>

1586
01:17:28.431 --> 01:17:30.950
<v Speaker 2>on these low level Pika gram amounts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1587
01:17:30.951 --> 01:17:33.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm happy that we were going to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>this out there.</v>

1588
01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:35.060
<v Speaker 2>So people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they have the time,</v>

1589
01:17:35.061 --> 01:17:35.894
<v Speaker 2>if they're really that interested in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is probably a more in depth </v>

1590
01:17:38.931 --> 01:17:41.000
<v Speaker 2>discussion of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're going to get anywhere else.</v>

1591
01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:45.230
<v Speaker 2>But I really wish we could have gotten </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like this to Nevada and Nevada</v>

1592
01:17:45.231 --> 01:17:47.360
<v Speaker 2>could have gone over this and looked at </v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1593
01:17:47.390 --> 01:17:49.190
<v Speaker 2>what I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're saying.</v>

1594
01:17:49.850 --> 01:17:54.050
<v Speaker 2>It seems to me that we could have just </v>
<v Speaker 2>had some sort of a meeting and kept this</v>

1595
01:17:54.051 --> 01:17:57.020
<v Speaker 2>fight in Nevada and it would have saved </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody a lot of heartache.</v>

1596
01:17:57.740 --> 01:17:58.573
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think things were pointing in </v>

1597
01:18:00.261 --> 01:18:02.700
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was no guarantees on that nice</v>

1598
01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:04.330
<v Speaker 2>baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's still come on.</v>

1599
01:18:04.340 --> 01:18:05.690
<v Speaker 2>It's Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1600
01:18:05.691 --> 01:18:07.370
<v Speaker 2>the other thing that was being looked at</v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

1601
01:18:07.430 --> 01:18:10.670
<v Speaker 2>was fairness to these athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really you're going to put,</v>

1602
01:18:11.060 --> 01:18:11.893
<v Speaker 2>you're going to put John and gus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe more importantly in a position </v>

1603
01:18:14.391 --> 01:18:15.224
<v Speaker 2>where he doesn't know until two days or </v>
<v Speaker 2>a day before whether this fight is </v>

1604
01:18:18.591 --> 01:18:19.460
<v Speaker 2>happening or not.</v>

1605
01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:23.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean these and not even mentioning the</v>
<v Speaker 2>other fighters on the card.</v>

1606
01:18:23.811 --> 01:18:25.490
<v Speaker 2>And Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can talk to,</v>

1607
01:18:25.491 --> 01:18:28.310
<v Speaker 2>and I have to Sean and Mick and Dana and</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunter.</v>

1608
01:18:28.730 --> 01:18:31.310
<v Speaker 2>All these fighters want to be on the big</v>
<v Speaker 2>paper views.</v>

1609
01:18:31.790 --> 01:18:34.700
<v Speaker 2>They know the bigger the fight at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>top of the card,</v>

1610
01:18:34.701 --> 01:18:38.480
<v Speaker 2>the more eyes are on that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you have a spectacular fight in</v>

1611
01:18:38.481 --> 01:18:43.481
<v Speaker 2>the first second fight on the card,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's on a big paper view with a giant</v>

1612
01:18:43.551 --> 01:18:45.710
<v Speaker 2>fight at the top of it that can propel </v>
<v Speaker 2>your career,</v>

1613
01:18:45.711 --> 01:18:46.544
<v Speaker 2>your next fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could be fighting the main event on </v>

1614
01:18:48.500 --> 01:18:51.890
<v Speaker 2>fight pass and progressed from there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think,</v>

1615
01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:52.753
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's accurate to say that </v>

1616
01:18:54.141 --> 01:18:58.070
<v Speaker 2>generally everybody wants these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these cards to be as big as possible.</v>

1617
01:18:58.071 --> 01:19:03.071
<v Speaker 2>And when all the experts are telling us </v>
<v Speaker 2>100% this isn't a sanction b,</v>

1618
01:19:03.740 --> 01:19:06.410
<v Speaker 2>he's not retaining any performance </v>
<v Speaker 2>enhancing benefits.</v>

1619
01:19:06.410 --> 01:19:07.243
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and clearly Dane and hunter thought </v>

1620
01:19:08.901 --> 01:19:09.734
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have an obligation to do what we can </v>

1621
01:19:11.271 --> 01:19:12.104
<v Speaker 2>do for fairness for John.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely for gus for the rest of the </v>

1622
01:19:16.281 --> 01:19:19.100
<v Speaker 2>card to try to make this fight happen </v>
<v Speaker 2>going forward.</v>

1623
01:19:19.101 --> 01:19:22.280
<v Speaker 2>Is there any way we could ever prevent </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like this from happening again</v>

1624
01:19:22.281 --> 01:19:25.280
<v Speaker 2>with the similar situation in place like</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nevada?</v>

1625
01:19:25.310 --> 01:19:26.143
<v Speaker 2>So here's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we have a couple solutions to </v>

1626
01:19:27.921 --> 01:19:30.470
<v Speaker 2>that and it's not necessarily relative </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the commission,</v>

1627
01:19:30.471 --> 01:19:33.860
<v Speaker 2>but one thing that obviously protected </v>
<v Speaker 2>John a lot,</v>

1628
01:19:33.861 --> 01:19:36.330
<v Speaker 2>and this was the frequency of testing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1629
01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:38.720
<v Speaker 2>if you look at his numbers and these </v>
<v Speaker 2>were,</v>

1630
01:19:39.230 --> 01:19:41.330
<v Speaker 2>these were instances where they </v>
<v Speaker 2>collected samples,</v>

1631
01:19:41.331 --> 01:19:44.060
<v Speaker 2>but in many of these cases they did </v>
<v Speaker 2>multiple tests on him.</v>

1632
01:19:44.061 --> 01:19:45.440
<v Speaker 2>And that means,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1633
01:19:45.441 --> 01:19:48.500
<v Speaker 2>the tests I'm reading were for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>anabolic steroid panel.</v>

1634
01:19:48.830 --> 01:19:51.950
<v Speaker 2>But in addition to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they may have done a biological passport</v>

1635
01:19:51.951 --> 01:19:56.090
<v Speaker 2>test on that same collection the May </v>
<v Speaker 2>have done in hgh test and epo test.</v>

1636
01:19:56.120 --> 01:19:57.890
<v Speaker 2>And this is all confidential that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>sought.</v>

1637
01:19:57.891 --> 01:19:58.724
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't release all this information </v>
<v Speaker 2>to these numbers on the publicly </v>

1638
01:20:00.651 --> 01:20:03.890
<v Speaker 2>available website that you don't see </v>
<v Speaker 2>what those tests are done.</v>

1639
01:20:03.891 --> 01:20:04.724
<v Speaker 2>So the reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they just told me this is John was </v>

1640
01:20:06.651 --> 01:20:07.484
<v Speaker 2>one of the most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if not the most tested athlete over </v>

1641
01:20:09.451 --> 01:20:10.284
<v Speaker 2>these last six months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you look at total amount of tests </v>

1642
01:20:13.410 --> 01:20:14.700
<v Speaker 2>on his samples,</v>
<v Speaker 2>excuse me,</v>

1643
01:20:15.870 --> 01:20:16.703
<v Speaker 2>one thing that obviously protecting them</v>
<v Speaker 2>here was that volume of testing and so </v>

1644
01:20:20.191 --> 01:20:21.780
<v Speaker 2>you saw it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it came to us and said,</v>

1645
01:20:22.170 --> 01:20:24.750
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we think that you probably should,</v>

1646
01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:25.673
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>up the amount of tests that you're </v>

1647
01:20:27.181 --> 01:20:28.050
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1648
01:20:28.590 --> 01:20:29.423
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just renewed a contract with Usada </v>

1649
01:20:31.771 --> 01:20:32.604
<v Speaker 2>and were reduce.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're increasing our testing numbers by </v>

1650
01:20:34.351 --> 01:20:36.690
<v Speaker 2>30 to 40%.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We currently,</v>

1651
01:20:37.130 --> 01:20:37.963
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first three years of the program </v>

1652
01:20:38.821 --> 01:20:41.460
<v Speaker 2>went under contract for approximately </v>
<v Speaker 2>2,700</v>

1653
01:20:41.461 --> 01:20:46.461
<v Speaker 2>tests and starting this next year we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to up that to around 43 4,400</v>

1654
01:20:46.861 --> 01:20:47.160
<v Speaker 2>tests.</v>

1655
01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:50.700
<v Speaker 2>So I think there is going to be more of </v>
<v Speaker 2>a burden they're going to be,</v>

1656
01:20:50.820 --> 01:20:51.653
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you saw to showing up in more doorsteps </v>

1657
01:20:53.221 --> 01:20:55.200
<v Speaker 2>early in the morning of more of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>athletes.</v>

1658
01:20:55.201 --> 01:20:56.034
<v Speaker 2>But I think this is a perfect example </v>
<v Speaker 2>that that increased volume of testing </v>

1659
01:20:58.831 --> 01:21:01.590
<v Speaker 2>actually can be a protectant to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>athlete,</v>

1660
01:21:01.591 --> 01:21:02.424
<v Speaker 2>especially when you're talking in these </v>
<v Speaker 2>low level Pika gram quantities and </v>

1661
01:21:05.221 --> 01:21:06.054
<v Speaker 2>contaminated cases and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just got to get athletes to stop </v>

1662
01:21:09.421 --> 01:21:10.254
<v Speaker 2>taking any supplement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not third party tested great </v>

1663
01:21:12.421 --> 01:21:14.610
<v Speaker 2>points.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's what we've done in that area.</v>

1664
01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:15.473
<v Speaker 2>So about three months ago you sought a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hosted a working group and included the </v>

1665
01:21:19.801 --> 01:21:22.740
<v Speaker 2>UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Myself and our worst nutritionist,</v>

1666
01:21:22.950 --> 01:21:27.090
<v Speaker 2>Clinton Wattenberg who you've met were </v>
<v Speaker 2>there majorly baseball was there,</v>

1667
01:21:27.810 --> 01:21:28.643
<v Speaker 2>the Department of Defense was there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's been war fighters who have </v>

1668
01:21:31.710 --> 01:21:32.543
<v Speaker 2>purchased supplements at bases over in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Iraq and Afghanistan that contain a </v>

1669
01:21:36.781 --> 01:21:38.550
<v Speaker 2>federal and another bad products.</v>

1670
01:21:38.550 --> 01:21:42.030
<v Speaker 2>Some of them potentially have died as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>result of ingesting them.</v>

1671
01:21:42.031 --> 01:21:45.330
<v Speaker 2>So they definitely have an interest in </v>
<v Speaker 2>safety and dietary supplements.</v>

1672
01:21:45.810 --> 01:21:46.643
<v Speaker 2>And you saw it as experts were there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we did is we invited in the major </v>

1673
01:21:50.371 --> 01:21:55.140
<v Speaker 2>third party certification companies and </v>
<v Speaker 2>each one took a half day presenting what</v>

1674
01:21:55.141 --> 01:21:55.974
<v Speaker 2>their programs look like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We went back and huddled after each one </v>

1675
01:21:59.071 --> 01:21:59.904
<v Speaker 2>and huddled at the conclusion and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is a platinum standard third party </v>

1676
01:22:03.541 --> 01:22:06.780
<v Speaker 2>certification look like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's all these presentations we got,</v>

1677
01:22:07.170 --> 01:22:08.003
<v Speaker 2>what was strengths and one's weaknesses </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the others and we have to put a </v>

1678
01:22:10.681 --> 01:22:12.090
<v Speaker 2>perfect one together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was it?</v>

1679
01:22:12.100 --> 01:22:15.810
<v Speaker 2>What does it look like over the last </v>
<v Speaker 2>month we've been offering,</v>

1680
01:22:15.930 --> 01:22:16.763
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a paper that's going to be published in </v>

1681
01:22:18.031 --> 01:22:18.864
<v Speaker 2>a scientific journal going over with </v>
<v Speaker 2>that gold standard platinum standard </v>

1682
01:22:22.561 --> 01:22:24.370
<v Speaker 2>looks like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1683
01:22:24.450 --> 01:22:28.920
<v Speaker 2>going forward any third party </v>
<v Speaker 2>certification company that can meet that</v>

1684
01:22:28.921 --> 01:22:30.300
<v Speaker 2>and there's some that are very close.</v>

1685
01:22:30.300 --> 01:22:32.070
<v Speaker 2>I think we'll be able to do it very </v>
<v Speaker 2>quickly.</v>

1686
01:22:32.580 --> 01:22:33.413
<v Speaker 2>We are going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you saw it is going to say this is an </v>

1687
01:22:36.191 --> 01:22:37.024
<v Speaker 2>approved line of supplements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We approve you to take this and this </v>

1688
01:22:40.690 --> 01:22:41.523
<v Speaker 2>something that we've been unable to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the first three and a half years of </v>

1689
01:22:43.411 --> 01:22:44.730
<v Speaker 2>the program.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'll tell you joe,</v>

1690
01:22:45.030 --> 01:22:47.640
<v Speaker 2>it's the most common question I get from</v>
<v Speaker 2>our athletes.</v>

1691
01:22:47.820 --> 01:22:51.460
<v Speaker 2>What's you sought approved?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as soon as I say you saw,</v>

1692
01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:55.920
<v Speaker 2>doesn't approve any supplements,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but here's how you ensure your safety.</v>

1693
01:22:56.460 --> 01:22:59.190
<v Speaker 2>They stop listening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>goes in one ear out the other.</v>

1694
01:22:59.250 --> 01:23:04.080
<v Speaker 2>This is a silly suggestion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but why doesn't the UFC come up with its</v>

1695
01:23:04.081 --> 01:23:08.080
<v Speaker 2>own supplement and provide them to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighters and say,</v>

1696
01:23:08.081 --> 01:23:09.730
<v Speaker 2>you can't take anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1697
01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:10.593
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's definitely been talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>through sponsorships with other </v>

1698
01:23:13.601 --> 01:23:14.860
<v Speaker 2>supplement line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1699
01:23:14.861 --> 01:23:16.270
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of dynamics to it.</v>

1700
01:23:16.270 --> 01:23:20.500
<v Speaker 2>It's not as easy as doing it overnight </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's distribution method.</v>

1701
01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:22.270
<v Speaker 2>Just see if he could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1702
01:23:22.300 --> 01:23:24.160
<v Speaker 2>you can take creatine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could take,</v>

1703
01:23:24.161 --> 01:23:26.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the multivitamins,</v>

1704
01:23:26.141 --> 01:23:27.310
<v Speaker 2>you could take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1705
01:23:27.311 --> 01:23:28.144
<v Speaker 2>a branch chain amino acids and all these</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that have been proven to be </v>

1706
01:23:30.461 --> 01:23:32.130
<v Speaker 2>effective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's,</v>

1707
01:23:32.150 --> 01:23:33.070
<v Speaker 2>that's weird too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1708
01:23:33.071 --> 01:23:33.904
<v Speaker 2>It's like they're effective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meaning they enhance performance and </v>

1709
01:23:35.831 --> 01:23:36.664
<v Speaker 2>recovery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they don't do enough to be </v>

1710
01:23:37.991 --> 01:23:40.240
<v Speaker 2>considered a performance enhancing drug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1711
01:23:40.241 --> 01:23:44.350
<v Speaker 2>And they're present in the food supply.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like basically out of community,</v>

1712
01:23:44.351 --> 01:23:46.550
<v Speaker 2>you can go eat 10 chicken breasts or you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1713
01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:47.433
<v Speaker 2>have us a couple scoops of protein if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're on the go and don't have time to </v>

1714
01:23:50.261 --> 01:23:51.190
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think,</v>

1715
01:23:51.191 --> 01:23:52.024
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>apples and oranges in terms of </v>

1716
01:23:53.380 --> 01:23:56.260
<v Speaker 2>performance enhancing or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1717
01:23:56.290 --> 01:23:58.720
<v Speaker 2>so the theory would be we have an </v>
<v Speaker 2>approved when,</v>

1718
01:23:58.750 --> 01:24:01.660
<v Speaker 2>when I'm or dawn or ask that question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's approved,</v>

1719
01:24:01.690 --> 01:24:03.880
<v Speaker 2>I can say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's,</v>

1720
01:24:03.881 --> 01:24:07.080
<v Speaker 2>let's say NSF NSF has 1200 supplements </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are approved.</v>

1721
01:24:07.080 --> 01:24:10.570
<v Speaker 2>I'd say all 1200 of these are approved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should only use these.</v>

1722
01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:12.340
<v Speaker 2>If something were to happen to an </v>
<v Speaker 2>athlete,</v>

1723
01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:13.593
<v Speaker 2>they'd used and approved line of </v>
<v Speaker 2>supplements to get out of jail free </v>

1724
01:24:16.451 --> 01:24:17.284
<v Speaker 2>card.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they can prove it and you saw it </v>

1725
01:24:18.471 --> 01:24:20.350
<v Speaker 2>independently prove it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no sanction.</v>

1726
01:24:20.351 --> 01:24:23.920
<v Speaker 2>I think that is going to go a long way </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'll give you a reason for that.</v>

1727
01:24:23.950 --> 01:24:24.783
<v Speaker 2>Majorly baseball does that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have for the last couple of years </v>

1728
01:24:27.700 --> 01:24:31.990
<v Speaker 2>now they have some advantage and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>all their athletes are employees and are</v>

1729
01:24:31.991 --> 01:24:35.230
<v Speaker 2>coming in to the same facility for </v>
<v Speaker 2>during the season,</v>

1730
01:24:35.231 --> 01:24:37.070
<v Speaker 2>so they have some control over there as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

1731
01:24:37.071 --> 01:24:39.520
<v Speaker 2>We don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our athletes are spread amongst,</v>

1732
01:24:39.521 --> 01:24:41.620
<v Speaker 2>I think 46 countries throughout the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

1733
01:24:41.621 --> 01:24:42.454
<v Speaker 2>so it's more of a challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But baseball said the only supplements </v>

1734
01:24:45.671 --> 01:24:49.510
<v Speaker 2>we're allowing in the clubhouse or in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>facility are,</v>

1735
01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:51.160
<v Speaker 2>and they use NSF supplements.</v>

1736
01:24:51.580 --> 01:24:54.460
<v Speaker 2>They had zero contaminated supplement </v>
<v Speaker 2>cases last year.</v>

1737
01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:55.353
<v Speaker 2>They had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're testing numbers were </v>

1738
01:24:57.191 --> 01:24:58.024
<v Speaker 2>four times the amount of our testing </v>
<v Speaker 2>numbers and zero contaminated </v>

1739
01:25:00.911 --> 01:25:01.744
<v Speaker 2>supplements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the proof's in the pudding right </v>

1740
01:25:03.011 --> 01:25:05.380
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they have to deal with NSF.</v>

1741
01:25:05.770 --> 01:25:09.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's a deal other than </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've examined who those certification</v>

1742
01:25:09.911 --> 01:25:11.690
<v Speaker 2>companies are and they feel that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

1743
01:25:11.740 --> 01:25:12.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the top of the line,</v>

1744
01:25:14.740 --> 01:25:15.573
<v Speaker 2>we don't want to exclude any and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>why we're contributing to this paper to </v>

1745
01:25:18.341 --> 01:25:19.001
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1746
01:25:19.001 --> 01:25:21.160
<v Speaker 2>anyone could be one of these approved </v>
<v Speaker 2>lines,</v>

1747
01:25:21.161 --> 01:25:24.400
<v Speaker 2>but you must meet this criteria for </v>
<v Speaker 2>platinum standard program,</v>

1748
01:25:24.401 --> 01:25:26.980
<v Speaker 2>but it's coming from someone who was in </v>
<v Speaker 2>his supplement business.</v>

1749
01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:29.350
<v Speaker 2>Me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the wild west out there.</v>

1750
01:25:29.650 --> 01:25:31.780
<v Speaker 2>Boy Is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a,</v>

1751
01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:34.870
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of shit out there that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

1752
01:25:35.110 --> 01:25:35.943
<v Speaker 2>they purposely add performance enhancing</v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs to their stuff because it's cheap </v>

1753
01:25:41.260 --> 01:25:42.093
<v Speaker 2>and people take it and they experience </v>
<v Speaker 2>these gains and then they sell a lot of </v>

1754
01:25:44.891 --> 01:25:46.600
<v Speaker 2>it and then you get a following.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1755
01:25:46.601 --> 01:25:49.260
<v Speaker 2>I saw that when I was with the FDA there</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

1756
01:25:49.261 --> 01:25:52.780
<v Speaker 2>and what they normally will do for maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first six months of the product,</v>

1757
01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:53.793
<v Speaker 2>they'll spike it with something if </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going that route and then to </v>

1758
01:25:56.171 --> 01:25:59.110
<v Speaker 2>decrease liability thereafter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've already got the following.</v>

1759
01:25:59.190 --> 01:26:01.420
<v Speaker 2>The bad stuff's working like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like hell.</v>

1760
01:26:01.630 --> 01:26:05.120
<v Speaker 2>And then they back off just in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>government and people go,</v>

1761
01:26:05.150 --> 01:26:06.470
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my body must have adapted.</v>

1762
01:26:06.471 --> 01:26:08.550
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Choose Sun.</v>

1763
01:26:10.810 --> 01:26:13.220
<v Speaker 2>This.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really such a shame because this is</v>

1764
01:26:13.221 --> 01:26:15.860
<v Speaker 2>such a fantastic fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1765
01:26:15.861 --> 01:26:20.780
<v Speaker 2>there's so much drama involved already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just having John Jones returning,</v>

1766
01:26:21.020 --> 01:26:24.680
<v Speaker 2>having Alexander Gustafson looking </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely sensational in his last fight</v>

1767
01:26:24.681 --> 01:26:25.514
<v Speaker 2>with glover to sharer all the trash talk</v>
<v Speaker 2>and hype and intensity in the fact that </v>

1768
01:26:29.601 --> 01:26:32.210
<v Speaker 2>this is really other than DC versus </v>
<v Speaker 2>John.</v>

1769
01:26:32.211 --> 01:26:34.760
<v Speaker 2>This is the fight that people want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>see in the light heavyweight division.</v>

1770
01:26:35.030 --> 01:26:36.350
<v Speaker 2>And look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody is saying,</v>

1771
01:26:36.351 --> 01:26:39.740
<v Speaker 2>and I'm certainly not saying that John </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't do anything wrong,</v>

1772
01:26:39.741 --> 01:26:40.574
<v Speaker 2>he obviously did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>John has two times now tested positive </v>

1773
01:26:44.601 --> 01:26:47.960
<v Speaker 2>for prohibited substance says.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

1774
01:26:48.590 --> 01:26:49.423
<v Speaker 2>in both occasions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>arbitrators have determine that it was </v>

1775
01:26:52.101 --> 01:26:55.460
<v Speaker 2>not done intentionally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyone who says it all,</v>

1776
01:26:55.461 --> 01:26:58.610
<v Speaker 2>John's getting off light on this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's been suspended for almost two and a</v>

1777
01:26:58.611 --> 01:26:59.444
<v Speaker 2>half years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for lack with a lack of evidence of any </v>

1778
01:27:03.590 --> 01:27:04.423
<v Speaker 2>intentional use are cheating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know how much money he's probably </v>

1779
01:27:07.671 --> 01:27:09.170
<v Speaker 2>lost in those two and a half years?</v>

1780
01:27:09.170 --> 01:27:13.730
<v Speaker 2>How many tens of millions of dollars </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't reputation anybody who says that</v>

1781
01:27:13.731 --> 01:27:14.564
<v Speaker 2>he got off Scot free on this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would argue the otherwise he was </v>

1782
01:27:18.011 --> 01:27:21.260
<v Speaker 2>felled to the strictest of liability </v>
<v Speaker 2>standards out there.</v>

1783
01:27:21.430 --> 01:27:24.320
<v Speaker 2>Some of the top of their game money </v>
<v Speaker 2>earning potential like him.</v>

1784
01:27:24.810 --> 01:27:27.550
<v Speaker 2>This is also an incredible amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>stress and,</v>

1785
01:27:27.590 --> 01:27:28.423
<v Speaker 2>and absolutely it's on him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He feels and he hears what people are </v>

1786
01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:32.713
<v Speaker 2>saying about them and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's got to be very difficult also </v>

1787
01:27:34.641 --> 01:27:36.980
<v Speaker 2>again coming off of this massive </v>
<v Speaker 2>suspension.</v>

1788
01:27:37.220 --> 01:27:39.650
<v Speaker 2>So he's coming off of the suspension,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was huge bay,</v>

1789
01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:41.210
<v Speaker 2>very public,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very worldwide,</v>

1790
01:27:41.300 --> 01:27:44.270
<v Speaker 2>right after the cocaine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the car accident,</v>

1791
01:27:44.271 --> 01:27:45.290
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the previous,</v>

1792
01:27:45.291 --> 01:27:46.810
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Dick Pills that had the,</v>

1793
01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.610
<v Speaker 2>the stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean this is so many things.</v>

1794
01:27:49.820 --> 01:27:50.653
<v Speaker 2>And then to have this happen literally </v>
<v Speaker 2>the week of and have the fight moved to </v>

1795
01:27:53.721 --> 01:27:55.700
<v Speaker 2>California.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1796
01:27:55.760 --> 01:27:58.250
<v Speaker 2>and I get the skepticism that's out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there again,</v>

1797
01:27:58.550 --> 01:27:59.383
<v Speaker 2>without delving into this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've spent hours and hours and these </v>

1798
01:28:02.331 --> 01:28:04.970
<v Speaker 2>experts have spent their careers looking</v>
<v Speaker 2>into that.</v>

1799
01:28:04.970 --> 01:28:08.720
<v Speaker 2>That's really what's required to get a </v>
<v Speaker 2>comprehension and understanding of it.</v>

1800
01:28:09.380 --> 01:28:11.180
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another thing,</v>

1801
01:28:11.181 --> 01:28:12.014
<v Speaker 2>another argument,</v>
<v Speaker 2>John's being treated specially because </v>

1802
01:28:14.210 --> 01:28:15.043
<v Speaker 2>he's John,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we had another athlete that this </v>

1803
01:28:17.990 --> 01:28:21.710
<v Speaker 2>somewhat identical thing happened too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but nowhere near at the level of John.</v>

1804
01:28:21.711 --> 01:28:22.544
<v Speaker 2>So a kid by the name of grant Dawson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Grant Dawson last summer was in the </v>

1805
01:28:26.871 --> 01:28:30.260
<v Speaker 2>date and white contender series had an </v>
<v Speaker 2>awesome fight.</v>

1806
01:28:30.470 --> 01:28:33.350
<v Speaker 2>Dana's like you got a contract kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1807
01:28:33.620 --> 01:28:35.470
<v Speaker 2>we get them into the Usada program </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1808
01:28:35.471 --> 01:28:36.304
<v Speaker 2>Would you solder quote program requires </v>
<v Speaker 2>you to disclose everything you've used </v>

1809
01:28:39.861 --> 01:28:43.370
<v Speaker 2>going back 12 months or one year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea being,</v>

1810
01:28:43.371 --> 01:28:44.204
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though you weren't under the </v>

1811
01:28:45.441 --> 01:28:47.240
<v Speaker 2>program,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you used,</v>

1812
01:28:47.390 --> 01:28:48.223
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oral Terenna ball eight or nine months </v>

1813
01:28:49.821 --> 01:28:50.654
<v Speaker 2>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there could still be an advantage that </v>

1814
01:28:52.521 --> 01:28:53.750
<v Speaker 2>you beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1815
01:28:53.751 --> 01:28:54.584
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to necessarily suspend </v>
<v Speaker 2>you because you weren't subject to the </v>

1816
01:28:56.751 --> 01:28:57.584
<v Speaker 2>program then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're not going to let you fight or </v>

1817
01:28:58.640 --> 01:28:59.473
<v Speaker 2>right away you can have to be in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>program for a certain amount of time </v>

1818
01:29:01.381 --> 01:29:02.214
<v Speaker 2>testing clean.</v>

1819
01:29:02.970 --> 01:29:05.010
<v Speaker 2>So he didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he didn't disclose it.</v>

1820
01:29:05.011 --> 01:29:06.960
<v Speaker 2>He was using anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His first test,</v>

1821
01:29:06.961 --> 01:29:10.770
<v Speaker 2>he tests positive for m three metabolite</v>
<v Speaker 2>low levels.</v>

1822
01:29:11.640 --> 01:29:14.220
<v Speaker 2>He goes to arbitration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>argues,</v>

1823
01:29:14.221 --> 01:29:16.830
<v Speaker 2>testifies under oath.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never heard of this substance.</v>

1824
01:29:16.831 --> 01:29:19.500
<v Speaker 2>I've never taken it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would never cheat.</v>

1825
01:29:19.530 --> 01:29:21.990
<v Speaker 2>Here are all the Suttons I was using.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't find it.</v>

1826
01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:23.633
<v Speaker 2>The arbitrator,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heres the hearing you saw to goes to </v>

1827
01:29:25.471 --> 01:29:26.940
<v Speaker 2>them and says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold on a second,</v>

1828
01:29:26.941 --> 01:29:29.550
<v Speaker 2>we're looking into this matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Talking to baseball,</v>

1829
01:29:29.551 --> 01:29:32.400
<v Speaker 2>whatever you saw it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it comes out that hey,</v>

1830
01:29:32.610 --> 01:29:33.443
<v Speaker 2>we can't prove that this didn't enter </v>
<v Speaker 2>his substance a year before that </v>

1831
01:29:37.261 --> 01:29:39.960
<v Speaker 2>disclosure required him to disclose what</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was using.</v>

1832
01:29:39.961 --> 01:29:42.930
<v Speaker 2>So he was basically led off and an </v>
<v Speaker 2>eligible,</v>

1833
01:29:42.931 --> 01:29:47.931
<v Speaker 2>so John's not the only person in the UFC</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this has happened to,</v>

1834
01:29:47.941 --> 01:29:48.774
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not withstanding other professional </v>

1835
01:29:50.311 --> 01:29:51.900
<v Speaker 2>sports leagues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other Olympics,</v>

1836
01:29:51.901 --> 01:29:55.320
<v Speaker 2>it's happened to other athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not the only one.</v>

1837
01:29:56.630 --> 01:30:01.400
<v Speaker 3>So I think what's important for people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get the skepticism,</v>

1838
01:30:01.610 --> 01:30:06.260
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's very important that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people don't accuse someone of something</v>

1839
01:30:06.261 --> 01:30:08.690
<v Speaker 3>that they didn't do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I want you,</v>

1840
01:30:08.691 --> 01:30:09.524
<v Speaker 3>if you're listening to this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want you to imagine if you're John </v>

1841
01:30:13.430 --> 01:30:16.520
<v Speaker 3>Jones and you trying to get your shit </v>
<v Speaker 3>together and you didn't do anything new,</v>

1842
01:30:16.730 --> 01:30:17.563
<v Speaker 3>he didn't do anything different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've got to have a path of redemption </v>

1843
01:30:21.801 --> 01:30:22.750
<v Speaker 3>for people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got,</v>

1844
01:30:22.760 --> 01:30:25.190
<v Speaker 3>you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if John,</v>

1845
01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:28.580
<v Speaker 3>as you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all these tests conclude,</v>

1846
01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:31.250
<v Speaker 3>if he didn't do anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>folks,</v>

1847
01:30:31.251 --> 01:30:33.620
<v Speaker 3>you got to stop saying he's cheating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get you got,</v>

1848
01:30:33.621 --> 01:30:37.340
<v Speaker 3>he's not cheating if he's not cheating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if it's showing that these are these</v>

1849
01:30:37.341 --> 01:30:41.030
<v Speaker 3>longterm residual metabolites that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>an incredibly small dosage,</v>

1850
01:30:41.630 --> 01:30:42.463
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a real cheaters out there and </v>

1851
01:30:44.181 --> 01:30:45.014
<v Speaker 3>John's fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has fucked up and you were all right </v>

1852
01:30:47.421 --> 01:30:48.950
<v Speaker 3>to be upset at him when he fucked up.</v>

1853
01:30:49.220 --> 01:30:53.030
<v Speaker 3>This is not as Lisa's my conclusion </v>
<v Speaker 3>after talking to you and,</v>

1854
01:30:53.450 --> 01:30:54.261
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I've,</v>

1855
01:30:54.261 --> 01:30:55.094
<v Speaker 3>I've talked to some independent </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientists that were skeptical about </v>

1856
01:30:56.811 --> 01:30:59.060
<v Speaker 3>some of the aspects of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're also,</v>

1857
01:30:59.930 --> 01:31:00.763
<v Speaker 3>they're skeptical because they're not up</v>
<v Speaker 3>to date perhaps on the differences in </v>

1858
01:31:05.391 --> 01:31:06.224
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this pulsing effect or the fact that </v>

1859
01:31:08.631 --> 01:31:13.310
<v Speaker 3>this is something that is relatively,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's not a lot of,</v>

1860
01:31:14.350 --> 01:31:16.850
<v Speaker 3>a lot of documentation on this mean this</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

1861
01:31:16.880 --> 01:31:17.713
<v Speaker 3>this is something that's relatively new </v>
<v Speaker 3>in terms of our ability to understand </v>

1862
01:31:20.721 --> 01:31:21.554
<v Speaker 3>Pika grams.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Our ability to understand this pulsing </v>

1863
01:31:23.331 --> 01:31:24.164
<v Speaker 3>affect all these different v these </v>
<v Speaker 3>variables that you have to take into </v>

1864
01:31:26.661 --> 01:31:29.240
<v Speaker 3>account when it comes to this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People love to call cheat,</v>

1865
01:31:29.270 --> 01:31:32.090
<v Speaker 3>they love to and it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's good that the people were out there</v>

1866
01:31:32.091 --> 01:31:34.690
<v Speaker 3>keeping people honest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think you got to,</v>

1867
01:31:34.760 --> 01:31:38.750
<v Speaker 3>we got to look at this the right way and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the right way is what you're,</v>

1868
01:31:38.751 --> 01:31:40.650
<v Speaker 3>the way you're laying it out here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't see any holes.</v>

1869
01:31:41.250 --> 01:31:42.083
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple things in the future that </v>

1870
01:31:43.891 --> 01:31:45.270
<v Speaker 2>people can look forward to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

1871
01:31:46.020 --> 01:31:46.853
<v Speaker 2>we want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and John was to fight in Nevada again </v>

1872
01:31:48.270 --> 01:31:50.100
<v Speaker 2>and Nevada has basically said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1873
01:31:50.101 --> 01:31:52.440
<v Speaker 2>I think we understand this his shoe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we need to have this hearing.</v>

1874
01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:56.460
<v Speaker 2>There will be a public hearing on this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My understanding is early quarter one,</v>

1875
01:31:56.461 --> 01:31:58.290
<v Speaker 2>so look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1876
01:31:58.410 --> 01:32:00.190
<v Speaker 2>don't take word for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wait until</v>

1877
01:32:00.190 --> 01:32:01.023
<v Speaker 3>January.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure they'll call some of these </v>

1878
01:32:02.051 --> 01:32:02.884
<v Speaker 3>experts to testify,</v>
<v Speaker 3>introduced some of these documents to </v>

1879
01:32:05.891 --> 01:32:08.500
<v Speaker 3>the public record longer even than this </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation.</v>

1880
01:32:08.530 --> 01:32:09.130
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>

1881
01:32:09.130 --> 01:32:10.270
<v Speaker 3>that would be my guess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1882
01:32:10.480 --> 01:32:12.430
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so yeah,</v>

1883
01:32:12.431 --> 01:32:13.870
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's to come,</v>

1884
01:32:14.710 --> 01:32:15.543
<v Speaker 3>the whole thing is such a disaster for </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody else on the card for Amanda </v>

1885
01:32:18.490 --> 01:32:21.130
<v Speaker 3>Nunez and Cris Cyborg and for all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>people on the undercard.</v>

1886
01:32:21.131 --> 01:32:25.960
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's just to have them to move </v>
<v Speaker 3>all the way to California when I'm happy</v>

1887
01:32:25.961 --> 01:32:28.000
<v Speaker 3>about though is that the fight is still </v>
<v Speaker 3>happening.</v>

1888
01:32:28.330 --> 01:32:30.160
<v Speaker 3>I'm very happy the fight is still </v>
<v Speaker 3>happening.</v>

1889
01:32:30.610 --> 01:32:31.450
<v Speaker 3>I am,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and again,</v>

1890
01:32:31.451 --> 01:32:32.284
<v Speaker 3>I have to take an objective look about </v>
<v Speaker 3>is this fair as it relates to how our </v>

1891
01:32:36.131 --> 01:32:39.010
<v Speaker 3>policy and what the rules are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1892
01:32:39.011 --> 01:32:40.810
<v Speaker 3>when you have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1893
01:32:40.840 --> 01:32:44.150
<v Speaker 3>one of the experts in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dr.</v>

1894
01:32:44.150 --> 01:32:46.270
<v Speaker 3>Daniel Wagner of this myrtle laboratory </v>
<v Speaker 3>issue,</v>

1895
01:32:46.271 --> 01:32:47.104
<v Speaker 3>an absolute statement like there is no </v>
<v Speaker 3>evidence the Dh cmt has been </v>

1896
01:32:51.221 --> 01:32:55.120
<v Speaker 3>readministered and that based on these </v>
<v Speaker 3>low levels,</v>

1897
01:32:55.450 --> 01:32:58.210
<v Speaker 3>he does not retaining a performance </v>
<v Speaker 3>enhancing benefit.</v>

1898
01:32:58.600 --> 01:32:59.433
<v Speaker 3>How out of fairness and implementing the</v>
<v Speaker 3>program do you prevent this fight from </v>

1899
01:33:02.261 --> 01:33:03.820
<v Speaker 3>happening?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't do that.</v>

1900
01:33:03.900 --> 01:33:08.010
<v Speaker 3>It would be categorically unfair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1901
01:33:08.110 --> 01:33:08.943
<v Speaker 3>moving forward from here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what changes and what do we do to stop </v>

1902
01:33:12.761 --> 01:33:14.000
<v Speaker 3>something like this from happening?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1903
01:33:14.010 --> 01:33:14.843
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the increased volume of testing </v>

1904
01:33:16.121 --> 01:33:16.954
<v Speaker 3>is going to help.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think being able to specifically </v>

1905
01:33:19.811 --> 01:33:23.680
<v Speaker 3>direct our athletes to approve line of </v>
<v Speaker 3>supplements will help.</v>

1906
01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:25.840
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

1907
01:33:25.841 --> 01:33:26.674
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can dawn and I can message the hell </v>

1908
01:33:28.961 --> 01:33:30.670
<v Speaker 3>out of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

1909
01:33:31.090 --> 01:33:31.670
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1910
01:33:31.670 --> 01:33:33.730
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it takes the athletes and their camps to</v>

1911
01:33:33.731 --> 01:33:34.564
<v Speaker 3>listen to what we're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I mean if anything good comes out of </v>

1912
01:33:36.551 --> 01:33:37.384
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hopefully it's a warning to those other </v>

1913
01:33:38.770 --> 01:33:40.880
<v Speaker 3>hours,</v>
<v Speaker 3>others out there about hair,</v>

1914
01:33:40.930 --> 01:33:43.480
<v Speaker 3>how careful you need to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So to,</v>

1915
01:33:43.481 --> 01:33:46.310
<v Speaker 3>just to wrap this up so people </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand if you,</v>

1916
01:33:46.311 --> 01:33:47.144
<v Speaker 3>if you want to put a button on this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no evidence whatsoever of any </v>

1917
01:33:50.381 --> 01:33:51.160
<v Speaker 3>microdosing.</v>

1918
01:33:51.160 --> 01:33:51.993
<v Speaker 3>So this is one of the concerns people </v>
<v Speaker 3>were worried about microdosing no </v>

1919
01:33:54.491 --> 01:33:57.370
<v Speaker 3>evidence whatsoever of microdosing </v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't be a substance.</v>

1920
01:33:57.371 --> 01:34:00.580
<v Speaker 3>You were generally microdose you do the </v>
<v Speaker 3>endogenous substances,</v>

1921
01:34:00.581 --> 01:34:05.410
<v Speaker 3>not exotic genus is also no evidence of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the short term and medium term.</v>

1922
01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:07.990
<v Speaker 3>Medium.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A medium term.</v>

1923
01:34:08.020 --> 01:34:08.853
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Metabolites that were recognized by her </v>

1924
01:34:11.741 --> 01:34:13.630
<v Speaker 3>chank off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does that any say his name again?</v>

1925
01:34:13.660 --> 01:34:17.680
<v Speaker 3>I think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why don't I Gregory Gregory.</v>

1926
01:34:17.681 --> 01:34:22.681
<v Speaker 3>It's not even Gregory [inaudible] that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only test we have no parent compound</v>

1927
01:34:23.441 --> 01:34:24.274
<v Speaker 3>ever found as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are these the only tests we have </v>

1928
01:34:26.171 --> 01:34:30.400
<v Speaker 3>that show these longterm short term and </v>
<v Speaker 3>medium term metabolites.</v>

1929
01:34:30.430 --> 01:34:31.263
<v Speaker 3>These,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the short term in the medium term ones </v>

1930
01:34:33.011 --> 01:34:33.844
<v Speaker 3>that would be indicative of him taking </v>
<v Speaker 3>it recently don't exist at any point in </v>

1931
01:34:38.081 --> 01:34:39.610
<v Speaker 3>time during these tests.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>

1932
01:34:39.940 --> 01:34:44.940
<v Speaker 3>So this is most likely something that is</v>
<v Speaker 3>inside of his body that is an incredibly</v>

1933
01:34:45.611 --> 01:34:50.470
<v Speaker 3>small levels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And is it safe to say that the detection</v>

1934
01:34:50.770 --> 01:34:51.603
<v Speaker 3>levels,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the detection methods are far </v>

1935
01:34:53.981 --> 01:34:56.620
<v Speaker 3>superior today than they were a year </v>
<v Speaker 3>ago,</v>

1936
01:34:56.650 --> 01:34:58.280
<v Speaker 3>two years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three years ago,</v>

1937
01:34:58.400 --> 01:35:02.390
<v Speaker 2>increase by thousands of percentage </v>
<v Speaker 2>points in sensitivity?</v>

1938
01:35:02.510 --> 01:35:03.343
<v Speaker 2>I mean again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how recently over the last five </v>

1939
01:35:05.631 --> 01:35:10.631
<v Speaker 2>years and how recently have they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they improve from today versus a year</v>

1940
01:35:11.630 --> 01:35:11.991
<v Speaker 2>ago?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1941
01:35:11.991 --> 01:35:13.550
<v Speaker 2>I believe so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

1942
01:35:13.551 --> 01:35:14.384
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I heard about the one pika gram </v>

1943
01:35:15.531 --> 01:35:17.870
<v Speaker 2>detection of the m three metabolite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1944
01:35:17.871 --> 01:35:19.370
<v Speaker 2>that was something that happened this </v>
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>

1945
01:35:19.371 --> 01:35:23.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm not aware of that ever being that </v>
<v Speaker 2>low of a number in any time in the past.</v>

1946
01:35:23.991 --> 01:35:25.490
<v Speaker 2>So I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1947
01:35:25.491 --> 01:35:28.970
<v Speaker 2>literally week by week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>month by one month as we're going here,</v>

1948
01:35:29.270 --> 01:35:30.103
<v Speaker 2>that level of sensitivity is increasing </v>
<v Speaker 2>and off essentially no possible </v>

1949
01:35:34.611 --> 01:35:38.060
<v Speaker 2>performance enhancing benefits from </v>
<v Speaker 2>these incredibly low levels.</v>

1950
01:35:38.150 --> 01:35:40.310
<v Speaker 2>That's what the experts are telling me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

1951
01:35:40.311 --> 01:35:41.021
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1952
01:35:41.021 --> 01:35:43.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm not the expert.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to profess that I am,</v>

1953
01:35:43.791 --> 01:35:46.100
<v Speaker 2>but what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do I have to go to?</v>

1954
01:35:46.101 --> 01:35:46.934
<v Speaker 2>I need to go to those experts that have </v>
<v Speaker 2>made careers out of studying these </v>

1955
01:35:49.691 --> 01:35:51.080
<v Speaker 2>substances and the benefits.</v>

1956
01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:51.913
<v Speaker 2>And they were all universally telling me</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's no performance enhancing </v>

1957
01:35:54.951 --> 01:35:58.460
<v Speaker 2>benefit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>full compliance by Jon Jones in terms of</v>

1958
01:35:58.461 --> 01:36:01.340
<v Speaker 2>being there for Usada at every single </v>
<v Speaker 2>task.</v>

1959
01:36:01.610 --> 01:36:03.590
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>notifying his whereabouts,</v>

1960
01:36:03.591 --> 01:36:04.424
<v Speaker 2>doing everything by the book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In terms of what the UFC requires and </v>

1961
01:36:06.741 --> 01:36:07.760
<v Speaker 2>what you saw to require.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1962
01:36:07.770 --> 01:36:10.550
<v Speaker 2>so our program has a three strike </v>
<v Speaker 2>policy.</v>

1963
01:36:10.551 --> 01:36:11.990
<v Speaker 2>So basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1964
01:36:11.991 --> 01:36:15.350
<v Speaker 2>if you miss a test for an unexplained </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason three times,</v>

1965
01:36:15.351 --> 01:36:19.370
<v Speaker 2>then it could be a violation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>John's never had one whereabouts strike.</v>

1966
01:36:19.371 --> 01:36:22.460
<v Speaker 2>He's always been available when you saw </v>
<v Speaker 2>it as tried to test them.</v>

1967
01:36:22.820 --> 01:36:24.350
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially recency.</v>

1968
01:36:24.380 --> 01:36:27.440
<v Speaker 2>Recently one of the most tested athletes</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the UFC.</v>

1969
01:36:27.650 --> 01:36:28.483
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't there one test in the past where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you sought a showed up at the gym and </v>

1970
01:36:32.301 --> 01:36:35.570
<v Speaker 2>there was some sort of speculation that </v>
<v Speaker 2>John was hiding under the ring pre Usada</v>

1971
01:36:35.800 --> 01:36:38.150
<v Speaker 2>that that was pre Usada before I got </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

1972
01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:39.710
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard about that at all.</v>

1973
01:36:39.711 --> 01:36:42.110
<v Speaker 2>The details.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know whether it's true or not.</v>

1974
01:36:42.111 --> 01:36:44.390
<v Speaker 2>I think it was a Nevada state athletic </v>
<v Speaker 2>commission test.</v>

1975
01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:45.650
<v Speaker 2>My recollection's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1976
01:36:45.651 --> 01:36:46.790
<v Speaker 2>But it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he sought a test.</v>

1977
01:36:46.880 --> 01:36:47.713
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's no reason in terms of how </v>

1978
01:36:50.811 --> 01:36:55.640
<v Speaker 2>you're looking at this particular case </v>
<v Speaker 2>that this fight should not take place or</v>

1979
01:36:55.641 --> 01:36:57.410
<v Speaker 2>that John should be sanctioned to any </v>
<v Speaker 2>further.</v>

1980
01:36:57.470 --> 01:36:58.650
<v Speaker 2>There isn't and look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1981
01:36:58.651 --> 01:37:02.030
<v Speaker 2>it's the least compelling argument,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think you know,</v>

1982
01:37:02.031 --> 01:37:02.864
<v Speaker 2>you have to look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to look at the common sense </v>

1983
01:37:04.641 --> 01:37:09.530
<v Speaker 2>approach to this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A guy who went through a year and a half</v>

1984
01:37:09.531 --> 01:37:10.364
<v Speaker 2>almost suspension to vary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would categorize as embarrassing </v>

1985
01:37:14.301 --> 01:37:19.301
<v Speaker 2>public hearings in California along </v>
<v Speaker 2>arbitration hearing before Mclaren.</v>

1986
01:37:19.940 --> 01:37:24.080
<v Speaker 2>All this science is rooted out about how</v>
<v Speaker 2>long this stuff stays in your system.</v>

1987
01:37:24.081 --> 01:37:24.914
<v Speaker 2>Longterm metabolites for months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe years you're going to choose to </v>

1988
01:37:28.641 --> 01:37:29.474
<v Speaker 2>use oral Terenna ball still after going </v>
<v Speaker 2>through all of that leading up to a </v>

1989
01:37:33.891 --> 01:37:35.720
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't buy that.</v>

1990
01:37:35.780 --> 01:37:37.100
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think,</v>

1991
01:37:37.220 --> 01:37:41.870
<v Speaker 2>I think I agree with what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in terms of people fucking up,</v>

1992
01:37:42.170 --> 01:37:43.003
<v Speaker 2>there are no bounds on human stupidity </v>
<v Speaker 2>and in terms of people's ability to do </v>

1993
01:37:47.721 --> 01:37:48.554
<v Speaker 2>impulsive things that are irrational,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that wind up sabotaging their career is </v>

1994
01:37:51.921 --> 01:37:55.920
<v Speaker 2>almost more of an indication that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>are willing to do than not.</v>

1995
01:37:55.950 --> 01:37:56.190
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

1996
01:37:56.190 --> 01:37:57.670
<v Speaker 3>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's low,</v>

1997
01:37:57.720 --> 01:38:00.120
<v Speaker 3>you're less likely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is in terms of,</v>

1998
01:38:00.270 --> 01:38:02.100
<v Speaker 3>especially in particular [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighters,</v>

1999
01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:03.113
<v Speaker 3>fighters are ridiculously impulsive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the things that categorizes </v>

2000
01:38:06.220 --> 01:38:07.053
<v Speaker 3>and it's a characteristic of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the type of human being that gets </v>

2001
01:38:09.271 --> 01:38:12.240
<v Speaker 3>involved in that line of work in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>first place.</v>

2002
01:38:12.390 --> 01:38:14.340
<v Speaker 3>They're wild motherfuckers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're crazy.</v>

2003
01:38:14.610 --> 01:38:17.070
<v Speaker 3>They do crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I just,</v>

2004
01:38:17.071 --> 01:38:18.360
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't buy that.</v>

2005
01:38:18.390 --> 01:38:20.400
<v Speaker 3>That would be new level crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And look again,</v>

2006
01:38:20.401 --> 01:38:23.010
<v Speaker 3>I categorize as a new level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy guy,</v>

2007
01:38:23.220 --> 01:38:24.900
<v Speaker 3>least compelling argument.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

2008
01:38:24.930 --> 01:38:25.763
<v Speaker 3>At least compelling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think we'd be remiss if we didn't </v>

2009
01:38:27.271 --> 01:38:28.650
<v Speaker 3>at least consider that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2010
01:38:28.680 --> 01:38:29.670
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2011
01:38:29.671 --> 01:38:32.030
<v Speaker 3>I see your point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't buy it that,</v>

2012
01:38:32.200 --> 01:38:33.360
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that part I don't buy.</v>

2013
01:38:33.361 --> 01:38:36.060
<v Speaker 3>I buy all the science and I'm a big John</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jones Fan.</v>

2014
01:38:36.120 --> 01:38:39.720
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can call me a John Jones suck up all</v>

2015
01:38:39.720 --> 01:38:40.553
<v Speaker 3>day long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's one of the greatest of all </v>

2016
01:38:40.861 --> 01:38:42.420
<v Speaker 3>time and I think it's not over for him.</v>

2017
01:38:42.420 --> 01:38:46.230
<v Speaker 3>I think he still could reach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even think he's at his peak.</v>

2018
01:38:46.260 --> 01:38:49.650
<v Speaker 3>I think he's still got time to be the </v>
<v Speaker 3>greatest of all time.</v>

2019
01:38:49.651 --> 01:38:53.190
<v Speaker 3>If he hasn't already achieved that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think that he's also,</v>

2020
01:38:53.310 --> 01:38:54.760
<v Speaker 3>he's a wild man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2021
01:38:54.790 --> 01:38:56.370
<v Speaker 3>it's one of the reasons why he's so </v>
<v Speaker 3>great.</v>

2022
01:38:56.371 --> 01:38:59.490
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the reasons why you opened </v>
<v Speaker 3>up the fight with Shogun at 22 years old</v>

2023
01:38:59.640 --> 01:39:02.960
<v Speaker 3>with a flying knee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's a wild motherfucker.</v>

2024
01:39:03.060 --> 01:39:07.800
<v Speaker 3>That's who he is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's one of many reasons besides his</v>

2025
01:39:07.801 --> 01:39:12.150
<v Speaker 3>talent that he's so God damn good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know the lows of the lows.</v>

2026
01:39:12.151 --> 01:39:12.984
<v Speaker 3>He's gone through these last two years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You really can't leave how low those </v>

2027
01:39:16.030 --> 01:39:18.000
<v Speaker 3>lines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so again,</v>

2028
01:39:18.001 --> 01:39:18.834
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't disagree with you that that's </v>

2029
01:39:19.711 --> 01:39:22.830
<v Speaker 3>not out of the area of consideration,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but man,</v>

2030
01:39:22.831 --> 01:39:24.240
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't,</v>

2031
01:39:24.330 --> 01:39:26.610
<v Speaker 3>I don't get anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could be by reckless.</v>

2032
01:39:26.670 --> 01:39:28.620
<v Speaker 3>I hope you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2033
01:39:28.740 --> 01:39:33.060
<v Speaker 3>I also worry that fighters often in </v>
<v Speaker 3>times,</v>

2034
01:39:33.061 --> 01:39:33.894
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not accusing John of doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but oftentimes surround themselves with </v>

2035
01:39:36.721 --> 01:39:39.990
<v Speaker 3>morons and these morons give them poor </v>
<v Speaker 3>advice.</v>

2036
01:39:40.140 --> 01:39:45.140
<v Speaker 3>And these morons think that they have </v>
<v Speaker 3>ways to skirt systems and get around the</v>

2037
01:39:46.111 --> 01:39:48.600
<v Speaker 3>rules and they have people that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2038
01:39:48.960 --> 01:39:51.810
<v Speaker 3>throw a bunch of fancy words their way </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they want to believe.</v>

2039
01:39:52.050 --> 01:39:52.883
<v Speaker 3>And this happens all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This happens all the time with fighters </v>

2040
01:39:55.051 --> 01:39:58.740
<v Speaker 3>in regards to financial management and </v>
<v Speaker 3>advice that they get with that.</v>

2041
01:39:58.890 --> 01:39:59.723
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I've seen like world class </v>

2042
01:40:01.801 --> 01:40:02.634
<v Speaker 3>fighters do ridiculous shit in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 3>strength and conditioning because some </v>

2043
01:40:05.551 --> 01:40:08.760
<v Speaker 3>asshole with a good vocabulary talks him</v>
<v Speaker 3>into some nonsense.</v>

2044
01:40:09.540 --> 01:40:10.373
<v Speaker 3>This is just one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>happens with fighters and oftentimes </v>

2045
01:40:13.561 --> 01:40:14.394
<v Speaker 3>they can be around someone who gives him</v>
<v Speaker 3>poor advice in terms of what they can </v>

2046
01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:17.873
<v Speaker 3>and cannot get away with when it comes </v>
<v Speaker 3>to supplementation and when it comes to </v>

2047
01:40:21.241 --> 01:40:21.990
<v Speaker 3>steroid use.</v>

2048
01:40:21.990 --> 01:40:22.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

2049
01:40:22.831 --> 01:40:25.890
<v Speaker 3>And I see that that all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In John's case,</v>

2050
01:40:25.891 --> 01:40:27.960
<v Speaker 3>however,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to give credit where credit's due,</v>

2051
01:40:28.020 --> 01:40:30.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his team after the initial positive with</v>

2052
01:40:30.891 --> 01:40:34.980
<v Speaker 3>a dick pills was very interactive with </v>
<v Speaker 3>me and Donna and you know,</v>

2053
01:40:34.981 --> 01:40:36.330
<v Speaker 3>checking supplements,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

2054
01:40:36.331 --> 01:40:39.300
<v Speaker 3>what line should we go to show they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2055
01:40:39.301 --> 01:40:40.134
<v Speaker 3>to give them credit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They definitely showed a increase </v>

2056
01:40:41.851 --> 01:40:44.790
<v Speaker 3>exercise of care when it came to </v>
<v Speaker 3>supplementation with John.</v>

2057
01:40:44.850 --> 01:40:45.780

01:40:47.791 --> 01:40:51.510
<v Speaker 3>and I hope this is the last time we ever</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to talk about John in this term and</v>

2060
01:40:51.511 --> 01:40:52.344

2125
01:43:51.230 --> 01:43:53.180
<v Speaker 2>It's not marketing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let me finish the story here.</v>

2126
01:43:53.181 --> 01:43:56.520
<v Speaker 2>So I'm in Chicago this year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there was a paper review.</v>

2127
01:43:56.540 --> 01:43:57.200
<v Speaker 2>You were there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2128
01:43:57.200 --> 01:43:58.033
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So something happened and I was late </v>

2129
01:43:59.751 --> 01:44:02.390
<v Speaker 2>getting to the arena and they had cut </v>
<v Speaker 2>off kind of the loading dock.</v>

2130
01:44:02.391 --> 01:44:05.300
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't get to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I had my oldest daughter with me.</v>

2131
01:44:05.780 --> 01:44:06.613
<v Speaker 2>And so we're having to walk through </v>
<v Speaker 2>where all the crowds walking in and you </v>

2132
01:44:10.521 --> 01:44:11.510

<v Speaker 2>I'm opening up presence.</v>

2138
01:44:26.180 --> 01:44:28.010

<v Speaker 2>daughters,</v>

<v Speaker 2>and my middle daughter's very artistic.</v>

2140
01:44:30.471 --> 01:44:34.670
<v Speaker 2>And so they create these cool sculpted </v>
<v Speaker 2>beer mugs and there's four of them.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you guys created it.</v>

2171
01:46:13.521 --> 01:46:15.900
<v Speaker 2>You've got to own it now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got one for shop too that you can feel</v>

2172
01:46:15.910 --> 01:46:17.630
<v Speaker 2>that on the shops mad at you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is He?</v>

2173
01:46:17.660 --> 01:46:18.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

2174
01:46:18.300 --> 01:46:20.270
<v Speaker 2>he called you the golden wrap now I'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>change.</v>

2175
01:46:20.780 --> 01:46:23.060
<v Speaker 2>I thought maybe you got him in here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's informed.</v>

2176
01:46:23.080 --> 01:46:23.913
<v Speaker 2>Misinformed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He thinks first of all that you were an </v>

2177
01:46:25.581 --> 01:46:26.630
<v Speaker 2>employee of you saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2178
01:46:26.631 --> 01:46:27.464
<v Speaker 2>there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that now you're an employee of the </v>

2179
01:46:28.731 --> 01:46:29.840
<v Speaker 2>UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2180
01:46:30.020 --> 01:46:32.830
<v Speaker 2>he's misinformed about that and I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

2181
01:46:32.870 --> 01:46:35.540
<v Speaker 2>he likes to call skeptical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He skeptical hippo.</v>

2182
01:46:36.470 --> 01:46:38.510
<v Speaker 2>I am skeptical as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

2183
01:46:39.470 --> 01:46:40.303
<v Speaker 2>one thing that I've learned from doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>this podcast over the years is that </v>

2184
01:46:43.160 --> 01:46:45.940
<v Speaker 2>there's no fucking way there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an,</v>

2185
01:46:46.040 --> 01:46:50.490
<v Speaker 2>it's impossible to know everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is impossible</v>

2186
01:46:51.060 --> 01:46:51.893
<v Speaker 3>and you have to rely on the expertise of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people who have spent a lifetime </v>

2187
01:46:56.731 --> 01:46:58.650
<v Speaker 3>studying these things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very important.</v>

2188
01:46:58.920 --> 01:46:59.753
<v Speaker 3>Here's another thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no way these people could be </v>

2189
01:47:03.631 --> 01:47:05.610
<v Speaker 3>lying about this and it wouldn't</v>

2190
01:47:05.720 --> 01:47:08.340
<v Speaker 2>massively damaged their career going </v>
<v Speaker 2>forward.</v>

2191
01:47:08.341 --> 01:47:11.060
<v Speaker 2>It'd be done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone would find out,</v>

2192
01:47:11.180 --> 01:47:14.210
<v Speaker 2>someone would get to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other scientists without them.</v>

2193
01:47:14.570 --> 01:47:16.670
<v Speaker 2>There would be studies done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there would be papers done,</v>

2194
01:47:16.671 --> 01:47:18.890
<v Speaker 2>the Internet would find out about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody would know.</v>

2195
01:47:19.190 --> 01:47:20.023
<v Speaker 2>There's no way it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty unprecedented in writing </v>

2196
01:47:22.491 --> 01:47:23.324
<v Speaker 2>with the lack of these studies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were Chenko one being the my </v>

2197
01:47:26.440 --> 01:47:27.620
<v Speaker 2>sanding even right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How'd he say it?</v>

2198
01:47:28.060 --> 01:47:28.893
<v Speaker 2>The check.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2199
01:47:29.630 --> 01:47:32.930
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty unprecedented that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>would put these absolutes in writing.</v>

2200
01:47:33.080 --> 01:47:34.040
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2201
01:47:34.041 --> 01:47:35.040
<v Speaker 2>with his law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2202
01:47:35.060 --> 01:47:35.893
<v Speaker 2>I think they looked at it very hard and </v>
<v Speaker 2>detailed and obviously they weren't </v>

2203
01:47:38.301 --> 01:47:41.090
<v Speaker 2>quick and turning it around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we would have loved this decision to</v>

2204
01:47:41.091 --> 01:47:45.410
<v Speaker 2>be made a lot earlier so we could have </v>
<v Speaker 2>rooted and vetted it out with Nevada.</v>

2205
01:47:45.860 --> 01:47:46.693
<v Speaker 2>But they did indeed sign their names to </v>
<v Speaker 2>these pretty absolute statements and </v>

2206
01:47:50.700 --> 01:47:53.120
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what else can the UFC and I do,</v>

2207
01:47:53.600 --> 01:47:54.433
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when these experts are putting those </v>

2208
01:47:55.491 --> 01:47:57.500
<v Speaker 2>absolutes out there and I get the people</v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

2209
01:47:57.501 --> 01:47:58.230
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoops,</v>

2210
01:47:58.230 --> 01:47:59.150
<v Speaker 2>could you actually do,</v>

2211
01:47:59.350 --> 01:48:02.440
<v Speaker 3>you got to understand folks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this would be career suicide.</v>

2212
01:48:02.500 --> 01:48:03.950
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the,</v>

2213
01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:08.200
<v Speaker 3>this is cutting edge science we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about.</v>

2214
01:48:08.350 --> 01:48:11.770
<v Speaker 3>There's too many people that would have </v>
<v Speaker 3>a vested interest in calling bullshit.</v>

2215
01:48:12.040 --> 01:48:12.873
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not something they don't fuck </v>

2216
01:48:14.951 --> 01:48:18.110
<v Speaker 3>around when it comes to these things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that people that are at the,</v>

2217
01:48:18.430 --> 01:48:19.263
<v Speaker 3>the front of the line,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it comes to catching people on </v>

2218
01:48:20.921 --> 01:48:22.710
<v Speaker 3>these things and the science that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're important,</v>

2219
01:48:22.940 --> 01:48:23.380
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

2220
01:48:23.380 --> 01:48:25.270
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're involved with.</v>

2221
01:48:25.271 --> 01:48:26.290
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not,</v>

2222
01:48:26.840 --> 01:48:27.673
<v Speaker 3>you get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't like gas on the outside with </v>

2223
01:48:29.711 --> 01:48:32.140
<v Speaker 3>no education.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just not wise.</v>

2224
01:48:32.920 --> 01:48:33.753
<v Speaker 3>And this is what I keep seeing over and </v>
<v Speaker 3>over again is people that have some </v>

2225
01:48:36.251 --> 01:48:39.250
<v Speaker 3>knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little bit of knowledge,</v>

2226
01:48:39.280 --> 01:48:41.650
<v Speaker 3>and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're pretending that they are,</v>

2227
01:48:41.700 --> 01:48:43.180
<v Speaker 3>they have a phd in this shit</v>

2228
01:48:44.290 --> 01:48:45.190
<v Speaker 2>go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2229
01:48:45.220 --> 01:48:46.510
<v Speaker 2>for those that want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2230

<v Speaker 2>do more detective work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go read Mclaren's written decision on </v>

2231

<v Speaker 2>John's July,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2018 July,</v>

2237
01:49:08.471 --> 01:49:09.760
<v Speaker 2>It goes away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>comes back,</v>

2238
01:49:09.761 --> 01:49:10.750
<v Speaker 2>lower,</v>
<v Speaker 2>goes away,</v>

2239
01:49:10.751 --> 01:49:12.190
<v Speaker 2>comes back higher.</v>
