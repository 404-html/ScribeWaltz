00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:05.200
<v Speaker 1>Three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

2
00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:06.663
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

3
00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.420
<v Speaker 2>Got a little thing going on here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we'll circle co Jeff,</v>

4
00:00:12.421 --> 00:00:13.410
<v Speaker 2>merry Christmas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's up,</v>

5
00:00:13.411 --> 00:00:14.320
<v Speaker 2>Joe?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You to live it.</v>

6
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.230
<v Speaker 2>Not been the easiest week and in my life</v>
<v Speaker 2>or my career as last week,</v>

7
00:00:19.231 --> 00:00:23.670
<v Speaker 2>but hanging in there to make this a</v>
<v Speaker 2>standalone so the people don't have to</v>

8
00:00:23.671 --> 00:00:27.630
<v Speaker 2>go figuring this out on their own and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure many,</v>

9
00:00:27.631 --> 00:00:30.810
<v Speaker 2>many fans are 20 and already know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The gist of the details.</v>

10
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.760
<v Speaker 2>Let's lay this out from the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>John Jones initial failed test.</v>

11
00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was July of 2017.</v>

12
00:00:39.271 --> 00:00:44.271
<v Speaker 2>He tested positive for approximately 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anywhere from 20 to 60 Pika grams of a</v>

13
00:00:46.171 --> 00:00:51.171
<v Speaker 2>longterm metabolite known as the m,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three metabolite of a substance called</v>

14
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.190
<v Speaker 2>to hydro chloral methyl Testosterone d,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hcm Tea,</v>

15
00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.560
<v Speaker 2>also known as oral to rentable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this was over a year ago.</v>

16
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.810
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was determined to be the source of</v>

17
00:01:03.811 --> 00:01:06.810
<v Speaker 2>this stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never determined what the source was.</v>

18
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.570
<v Speaker 2>So John went through a full arbitration</v>
<v Speaker 2>hearing,</v>

19
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.990
<v Speaker 2>was never able to determine where it</v>
<v Speaker 2>came from,</v>

20
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.090
<v Speaker 2>tested all the supplements he was using,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

21
00:01:16.091 --> 00:01:20.910
<v Speaker 2>went through many interviews with Usada,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had a full on arbitration hearing.</v>

22
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.100
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the source was never determined where it</v>

23
00:01:23.101 --> 00:01:27.330
<v Speaker 2>came from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why was this suspension so low or so</v>

24
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.193
<v Speaker 2>short?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

25
00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.040
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't determined,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I mean there's many factors that go</v>

26
00:01:32.041 --> 00:01:36.450
<v Speaker 2>into what that suspension was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would argue in the totality of the</v>

27
00:01:36.451 --> 00:01:38.940
<v Speaker 2>evidence that was presented in that</v>
<v Speaker 2>arbitration,</v>

28
00:01:38.941 --> 00:01:42.110
<v Speaker 2>that it wasn't a short suspension.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

29
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.540
<v Speaker 2>because really one key thing came out at</v>
<v Speaker 2>arbitration.</v>

30
00:01:45.541 --> 00:01:49.860
<v Speaker 2>So John went to arbitration before an</v>
<v Speaker 2>individual by the name of Richard</v>

31
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.560
<v Speaker 2>Mclaren.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Richard Mclaren has an arbitration group</v>

32
00:01:52.561 --> 00:01:57.210
<v Speaker 2>up in Canada and Mclaren is probably</v>
<v Speaker 2>worldwide known as one of the most</v>

33
00:01:57.211 --> 00:02:02.211
<v Speaker 2>credible guys in anti-doping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you had the ICARUS producer</v>

34
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:07.370
<v Speaker 2>director on the Mclaren report was the</v>
<v Speaker 2>report that came from all that.</v>

35
00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.710
<v Speaker 2>He basically investigated the Russian</v>
<v Speaker 2>state being involved in doping and Sochi</v>

36
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.720
<v Speaker 2>Games and put out actually a series of</v>
<v Speaker 2>reports on it,</v>

37
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.780
<v Speaker 2>detailing that up to 1000 Russian</v>
<v Speaker 2>athletes.</v>

38
00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:19.800
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

39
00:02:19.801 --> 00:02:23.550
<v Speaker 2>we're breaking the rules and the Russian</v>
<v Speaker 2>laboratory was helping them get around</v>

40
00:02:23.551 --> 00:02:25.230
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's a very,</v>

41
00:02:25.231 --> 00:02:29.220
<v Speaker 2>very respected guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's independent of obviously the UFC.</v>

42
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.170
<v Speaker 2>He's independent of Usada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He acts on his own and his determination</v>

43
00:02:34.171 --> 00:02:38.010
<v Speaker 2>was his determination,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'll read you kind of what he said.</v>

44
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.490
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find that all evidence available to me</v>

45
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.420
<v Speaker 2>leads me to conclude that the violation</v>
<v Speaker 2>was not intended,</v>

46
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.620
<v Speaker 2>nor could it have enhanced the athlete's</v>
<v Speaker 2>performance.</v>

47
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.120
<v Speaker 2>So a non-intentional so not intentional</v>
<v Speaker 2>ingestion.</v>

48
00:02:54.121 --> 00:02:57.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's no argument that it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>in his system that he found the evidence</v>

49
00:02:57.091 --> 00:03:01.390
<v Speaker 2>to show non-intentional use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he went further saying that</v>

50
00:03:01.391 --> 00:03:05.200
<v Speaker 2>based on the numbers of what he saw in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the evidence that was not even a</v>

51
00:03:05.201 --> 00:03:09.310
<v Speaker 2>performance enhancing benefit afforded</v>
<v Speaker 2>to John for having this longterm</v>

52
00:03:09.311 --> 00:03:10.540
<v Speaker 2>metabolite in his system.</v>

53
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.720
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's significant when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about hey,</v>

54
00:03:13.721 --> 00:03:17.080
<v Speaker 2>15 months was that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of light being that this is</v>

55
00:03:17.081 --> 00:03:20.080
<v Speaker 2>the second time through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would argue that if there was an</v>

56
00:03:20.081 --> 00:03:23.380
<v Speaker 2>argument that maybe it's on the Higher</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ed and certainly,</v>

57
00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll talk about the California</v>

58
00:03:25.301 --> 00:03:27.730
<v Speaker 2>commission.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Andy Foster took that position,</v>

59
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in John's recent California hearing,</v>

60
00:03:30.551 --> 00:03:33.540
<v Speaker 2>he was a little bit critical of Usada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

61
00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:34.560
<v Speaker 2>he thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

62
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.960
<v Speaker 2>he's intimately familiar with is</v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence both in the previous case and</v>

63
00:03:37.961 --> 00:03:41.200
<v Speaker 2>this occurrence that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he also saw that there was no</v>

64
00:03:41.201 --> 00:03:43.570
<v Speaker 2>evidence that an independent arbitrator,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

65
00:03:43.571 --> 00:03:48.040
<v Speaker 2>made this a statement and decision of</v>
<v Speaker 2>John Intentionally cheating.</v>

66
00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.170
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if anything,</v>

67
00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd say that potentially there could be</v>

68
00:03:51.911 --> 00:03:55.360
<v Speaker 2>an argument that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it was on the higher end versus the</v>

69
00:03:55.361 --> 00:03:58.840
<v Speaker 2>lower end because of the fact that it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was an unintentional ingestion.</v>

70
00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:59.440
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

71
00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.540
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is John's excuse?</v>

72
00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.820
<v Speaker 2>What is what it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>John said how he got this into assist.</v>

73
00:04:04.821 --> 00:04:05.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well look,</v>

74
00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's detailed in the arbitration</v>

75
00:04:07.961 --> 00:04:10.210
<v Speaker 2>hearing at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>John John fully admits that,</v>

76
00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the lifestyle lifestyle</v>

77
00:04:11.951 --> 00:04:13.810
<v Speaker 2>decisions he was making,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

78
00:04:13.811 --> 00:04:15.790
<v Speaker 2>the partying and things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

79
00:04:15.791 --> 00:04:20.380
<v Speaker 2>probably did not lead to making smart</v>
<v Speaker 2>decisions and making smart choices in</v>

80
00:04:20.381 --> 00:04:22.990
<v Speaker 2>terms of what was being ingested in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>

81
00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.790
<v Speaker 2>But certainly his testimony was under</v>
<v Speaker 2>oath that I have never intentionally</v>

82
00:04:27.791 --> 00:04:32.500
<v Speaker 2>cheated and did not intentionally put</v>
<v Speaker 2>this substance in my body and not only</v>

83
00:04:32.501 --> 00:04:34.990
<v Speaker 2>this case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as we talk about the subsequent case</v>

84
00:04:34.991 --> 00:04:37.960
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you'll see that based on the</v>

85
00:04:37.961 --> 00:04:38.920
<v Speaker 2>numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

86
00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:43.330
<v Speaker 2>coming out of his tests and based on</v>
<v Speaker 2>some studies that have been done on some</v>

87
00:04:43.331 --> 00:04:45.580
<v Speaker 2>of these substances that would tend to</v>
<v Speaker 2>support that.</v>

88
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:46.180
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

89
00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.990
<v Speaker 2>Correct me if I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but didn't John tests negative then</v>

90
00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.510
<v Speaker 2>tests positive for extremely low</v>
<v Speaker 2>numbers.</v>

91
00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.140
<v Speaker 2>This is the initial test before we get</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the most recent film he did.</v>

92
00:04:56.141 --> 00:05:01.141
<v Speaker 2>So he tested negative then test positive</v>
<v Speaker 2>very shortly after with a very small</v>

93
00:05:02.021 --> 00:05:03.100
<v Speaker 2>trace amounts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

94
00:05:03.101 --> 00:05:07.000
<v Speaker 2>So you have two negative tests on July</v>
<v Speaker 2>seventh and July eighth I believe,</v>

95
00:05:07.001 --> 00:05:10.060
<v Speaker 2>of 2017.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then weigh in day,</v>

96
00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.650
<v Speaker 2>I think it was July 28th.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was positive for a very low level of</v>

97
00:05:14.651 --> 00:05:18.130
<v Speaker 2>the three metabolite and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we might as well start here.</v>

98
00:05:18.131 --> 00:05:20.740
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going back to ICARUS,</v>

99
00:05:20.741 --> 00:05:22.120
<v Speaker 2>remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember the doctor,</v>

100
00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's the main character in that</v>
<v Speaker 2>chunk of in 2011,</v>

101
00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.620
<v Speaker 2>he put out a study on oral to rentable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He actually my understanding is dosed</v>

102
00:05:33.191 --> 00:05:38.191
<v Speaker 2>himself and then studied the excretion</v>
<v Speaker 2>of his urine and what was coming out of</v>

103
00:05:38.741 --> 00:05:43.540
<v Speaker 2>it over the weeks and months after and</v>
<v Speaker 2>determined that there were multiple</v>

104
00:05:43.541 --> 00:05:48.541
<v Speaker 2>maybe up to 50 metabolites that once</v>
<v Speaker 2>this Dah cmt was ingested into the body,</v>

105
00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.490
<v Speaker 2>the body converted into other substances</v>
<v Speaker 2>and these metabolites stayed around.</v>

106
00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:59.490
<v Speaker 2>He identified some short term,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some medium term metabolites and some</v>

107
00:06:00.621 --> 00:06:03.470
<v Speaker 2>longterm metabolites,</v>
<v Speaker 2>specifically the m three that John's</v>

108
00:06:03.471 --> 00:06:07.040
<v Speaker 2>tested positive for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So these longterm metabolites would</v>

109
00:06:07.041 --> 00:06:09.380
<v Speaker 2>indicate that it was taken long time</v>
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>

110
00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.760
<v Speaker 2>They would stay around for the longest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

111
00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:15.530
<v Speaker 2>Why was he testing negative and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>testing positive for these extremely.</v>

112
00:06:15.531 --> 00:06:16.940
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the numbers.</v>

113
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:19.750
<v Speaker 2>That's a good question and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's basically the question that</v>

114
00:06:19.751 --> 00:06:22.280
<v Speaker 2>point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what was not occurring and what has</v>

115
00:06:22.281 --> 00:06:27.281
<v Speaker 2>never occurred in any of John Sampled is</v>
<v Speaker 2>any presence of the short and medium</v>

116
00:06:28.821 --> 00:06:33.821
<v Speaker 2>term metabolites.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you look at a [inaudible] study,</v>

117
00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:38.000
<v Speaker 2>he identifies a couple of these medium</v>
<v Speaker 2>term metabolites,</v>

118
00:06:38.001 --> 00:06:41.810
<v Speaker 2>Roman numeral one and Roman numeral two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he says,</v>

119
00:06:41.811 --> 00:06:46.550
<v Speaker 2>these metabolites based on his study</v>
<v Speaker 2>will stay in the body at least 22 days.</v>

120
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:49.610
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's look back to the July seventh and</v>

121
00:06:49.611 --> 00:06:50.300
<v Speaker 2>eighth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

122
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:51.170
<v Speaker 2>positive tests.</v>

123
00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:53.840
<v Speaker 2>He's negative on July seventh and eighth</v>
<v Speaker 2>for everything,</v>

124
00:06:53.841 --> 00:06:57.650
<v Speaker 2>for the parent compound,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the short term medium term</v>

125
00:06:57.651 --> 00:07:02.651
<v Speaker 2>metabolites and the longterm metabolites</v>
<v Speaker 2>go 20,</v>

126
00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.900
<v Speaker 2>21 days later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So within that 22 day window,</v>

127
00:07:05.901 --> 00:07:09.110
<v Speaker 2>which is study shows the short and</v>
<v Speaker 2>medium term metabolites would still be</v>

128
00:07:09.111 --> 00:07:13.880
<v Speaker 2>showing up and there's no presence</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever of the short or medium term</v>

129
00:07:13.881 --> 00:07:15.140
<v Speaker 2>metabolites.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now again,</v>

130
00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:18.350
<v Speaker 2>we'll get into this a little bit more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think the science,</v>

131
00:07:18.351 --> 00:07:23.180
<v Speaker 2>what it's showing is a pulsing effect</v>
<v Speaker 2>for this longterm metabolite.</v>

132
00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:26.780
<v Speaker 2>Meaning once you ingest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether intentionally or not</v>

133
00:07:26.781 --> 00:07:30.590
<v Speaker 2>intentionally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oral Terenna ball into the body,</v>

134
00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:34.370
<v Speaker 2>the body breaks it down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>produces short term and medium term,</v>

135
00:07:34.371 --> 00:07:35.300
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

136
00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:38.330
<v Speaker 2>visible for a short and medium amount of</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

137
00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:41.990
<v Speaker 2>And then this n three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is produced for a long period of</v>

138
00:07:41.991 --> 00:07:45.080
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think with the issue appears to be,</v>

139
00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:48.890
<v Speaker 2>and we'll get into this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the UFC program is not the only program</v>

140
00:07:48.891 --> 00:07:49.520
<v Speaker 2>that seen this.</v>

141
00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:53.240
<v Speaker 2>There's another professional sports</v>
<v Speaker 2>league that has seen it very frequently.</v>

142
00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:55.940
<v Speaker 2>You sat is also seen this on the Olympic</v>
<v Speaker 2>side,</v>

143
00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:00.980
<v Speaker 2>but we're seeing this strange action</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the longterm and three metabolite</v>

144
00:08:00.981 --> 00:08:05.981
<v Speaker 2>and the theory is it may be hiding in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fat tissues surrounding organs and</v>

145
00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:11.510
<v Speaker 2>maybe have a pulsing effect where it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>released at certain times and other</v>

146
00:08:11.511 --> 00:08:15.710
<v Speaker 2>times you can't detect it and this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>not the actual substance itself,</v>

147
00:08:15.711 --> 00:08:18.620
<v Speaker 2>but it's a metabolite correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which indicates a reaction to this</v>

148
00:08:18.621 --> 00:08:22.710
<v Speaker 2>substance and it indicates the body</v>
<v Speaker 2>breaking down the parent compound the,</v>

149
00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.550
<v Speaker 2>the oral Terenna Ball,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and turning it into these other things</v>

150
00:08:25.551 --> 00:08:28.940
<v Speaker 2>which are stored in the body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's metabolites are not performance</v>

151
00:08:28.941 --> 00:08:32.900
<v Speaker 2>enhancing drugs that are the result of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the breakdown of the parent drug in the</v>

152
00:08:32.901 --> 00:08:33.710
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

153
00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:36.380
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much time is it detectable?</v>

154
00:08:36.381 --> 00:08:39.260
<v Speaker 2>The actual drug itself?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So pretty quick,</v>

155
00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.970
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a pretty quick clearance time.</v>

156
00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:43.000
<v Speaker 2>I think we're Cenk off study says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

157
00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:44.320
<v Speaker 2>maybe a week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

158
00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:47.720
<v Speaker 2>so it's not around for very long and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why he conducted the study</v>

159
00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:52.280
<v Speaker 2>ironically enough and I was going to go</v>
<v Speaker 2>watch vigorous here last night and I</v>

160
00:08:52.281 --> 00:08:55.500
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had too much going on in the last</v>

161
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:58.140
<v Speaker 2>week to kind of refresh mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but apparently he,</v>

162
00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:01.260
<v Speaker 2>he knew this was part of his protocol</v>
<v Speaker 2>for Russian athletes.</v>

163
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:05.280
<v Speaker 2>He knew a coach that was still giving</v>
<v Speaker 2>the oral Terenna ball to Russian</v>

164
00:09:05.281 --> 00:09:07.560
<v Speaker 2>athletes and he had a falling out with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the coach,</v>

165
00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:11.040
<v Speaker 2>so he goes off on the side and studies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

166
00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:14.490
<v Speaker 2>the parent compounds is going to get in</v>
<v Speaker 2>and out of the body pretty quick.</v>

167
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:16.170
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be difficult to detect</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

168
00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:19.410
<v Speaker 2>Let's try to figure out what stays</v>
<v Speaker 2>around and leaves markers in the body</v>

169
00:09:19.411 --> 00:09:22.080
<v Speaker 2>for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he developed these short and</v>

170
00:09:22.081 --> 00:09:26.940
<v Speaker 2>longterm metabolite tests and was able</v>
<v Speaker 2>to catch some of these coaches athletes</v>

171
00:09:26.941 --> 00:09:28.300
<v Speaker 2>for using the oral to rentable.</v>

172
00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:31.500
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the actual drug itself has gone from</v>

173
00:09:31.501 --> 00:09:33.450
<v Speaker 2>the system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the metabolite remains.</v>

174
00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:37.050
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the window that this metabolite</v>

175
00:09:37.051 --> 00:09:38.790
<v Speaker 2>is supposed to be detectable in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>body?</v>

176
00:09:38.791 --> 00:09:41.400
<v Speaker 2>Because we're talking now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are we at like 18 months?</v>

177
00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:43.920
<v Speaker 2>So here's the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the problem is that initial</v>

178
00:09:43.921 --> 00:09:46.830
<v Speaker 2>ingestion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because my question is these same</v>

179
00:09:46.831 --> 00:09:51.390
<v Speaker 2>longterm metabolites,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these existed a year plus ago.</v>

180
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.660
<v Speaker 2>It was more than a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How long ago that,</v>

181
00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:56.950
<v Speaker 2>that's the July 2017.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was your initial test?</v>

182
00:09:56.951 --> 00:09:59.280
<v Speaker 2>So with all the experts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we'll get through this with all the</v>

183
00:09:59.281 --> 00:10:04.281
<v Speaker 2>experts are telling us is there is no</v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence of reinjection and most likely</v>

184
00:10:05.551 --> 00:10:09.510
<v Speaker 2>this is still remnants from the July</v>
<v Speaker 2>2017 tests,</v>

185
00:10:09.511 --> 00:10:12.470
<v Speaker 2>however it was to enter into a system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

186
00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:15.030
<v Speaker 2>and we'll go through some of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>testing numbers that have shown</v>

187
00:10:15.031 --> 00:10:18.150
<v Speaker 2>negatives followed by very low level</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pika.</v>

188
00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:23.450
<v Speaker 2>Pika gram quantities question though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was that the ingestion that happened</v>

189
00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:28.790
<v Speaker 2>that he tested positive for in July of</v>
<v Speaker 2>2017 indicated a longterm effect,</v>

190
00:10:29.011 --> 00:10:29.160
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

191
00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.620
<v Speaker 2>It was a long term chart metabolite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>correct.</v>

192
00:10:31.621 --> 00:10:34.350
<v Speaker 2>So meaning it had already been an</v>
<v Speaker 2>assistant for a year,</v>

193
00:10:34.351 --> 00:10:36.610
<v Speaker 2>so it absolutely could have predated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

194
00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:40.440
<v Speaker 2>the theory the first time through was</v>
<v Speaker 2>something had to have entered his system</v>

195
00:10:40.441 --> 00:10:44.790
<v Speaker 2>between July seventh and July eighth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those negatives and this low pika gram</v>

196
00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:48.480
<v Speaker 2>reading on July 28th.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Over this last year,</v>

197
00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.090
<v Speaker 2>there's been a lot of study into this</v>
<v Speaker 2>longterm metabolite.</v>

198
00:10:51.091 --> 00:10:53.580
<v Speaker 2>As I mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this isn't just a UFC issue.</v>

199
00:10:53.581 --> 00:10:57.360
<v Speaker 2>There's another major professional</v>
<v Speaker 2>sports league that for the time being</v>

200
00:10:57.361 --> 00:10:59.610
<v Speaker 2>wants to keep their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their testing confidential,</v>

201
00:10:59.611 --> 00:11:02.190
<v Speaker 2>but they've shared that information with</v>
<v Speaker 2>scientists,</v>

202
00:11:02.191 --> 00:11:04.020
<v Speaker 2>with Usada,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with myself.</v>

203
00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:08.460
<v Speaker 2>They saw it on multiple occasions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This pulsing effect over a year where</v>

204
00:11:08.461 --> 00:11:11.310
<v Speaker 2>you'd see this positive test over a</v>
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>

205
00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:13.380
<v Speaker 2>We're two and a half years now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

206
00:11:13.381 --> 00:11:15.230
<v Speaker 2>If it's a year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's a.</v>

207
00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:18.960
<v Speaker 2>If in July,</v>
<v Speaker 2>July 2017 until you were talking a year</v>

208
00:11:18.961 --> 00:11:19.794
<v Speaker 2>and a half,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

209
00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:24.920
<v Speaker 2>July 2017.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it could have been an assistant a</v>

210
00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:25.640
<v Speaker 2>year prior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

211
00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:27.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could have been a couple months a</v>

212
00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:28.081
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

213
00:11:28.081 --> 00:11:30.570
<v Speaker 2>He had never showed up for that end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three metabolite for.</v>

214
00:11:30.571 --> 00:11:34.470
<v Speaker 2>He had been tested for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had been tested multiple times in the</v>

215
00:11:34.471 --> 00:11:37.140
<v Speaker 2>programming from wrong isn't the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>level,</v>

216
00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:40.890
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Approximately the same Pika grams that</v>

217
00:11:40.891 --> 00:11:45.891
<v Speaker 2>exists today in 2018 that were there in</v>
<v Speaker 2>2017.</v>

218
00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:49.110
<v Speaker 2>Generally if you look and we can go over</v>
<v Speaker 2>these numbers,</v>

219
00:11:49.111 --> 00:11:51.990
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it fluctuates from single digit and</v>

220
00:11:51.991 --> 00:11:55.090
<v Speaker 2>never gets into triple digits to mid</v>
<v Speaker 2>double digits,</v>

221
00:11:55.091 --> 00:11:59.890
<v Speaker 2>so there's some as low as nine Pika</v>
<v Speaker 2>grams over that time there was some at</v>

222
00:11:59.891 --> 00:12:03.580
<v Speaker 2>60 pika grams per gram to someone who is</v>
<v Speaker 2>a preposterous.</v>

223
00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:05.890
<v Speaker 2>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know the.</v>

224
00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:10.750
<v Speaker 2>The analogy that I heard early on was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think John uses throw a pinch of</v>

225
00:12:10.751 --> 00:12:12.580
<v Speaker 2>salt in Olympic swimming pool and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

226
00:12:12.581 --> 00:12:15.070
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's kind of wrap your head</v>

227
00:12:15.071 --> 00:12:15.280
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>

228
00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:18.250
<v Speaker 2>Now let's go the other side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's talk about something really small</v>

229
00:12:18.251 --> 00:12:22.120
<v Speaker 2>that we know of and how many times you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to break down that small particle</v>

230
00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:26.080
<v Speaker 2>to get to a pika gram.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one grain of salt and we all know</v>

231
00:12:26.081 --> 00:12:27.130
<v Speaker 2>what that looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

232
00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:31.420
<v Speaker 2>You put that in front of you and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>split that and I'd mentioned this week,</v>

233
00:12:31.421 --> 00:12:33.910
<v Speaker 2>$50 million.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's actually 58 million.</v>

234
00:12:33.911 --> 00:12:36.880
<v Speaker 2>If you split that 58 million times a</v>
<v Speaker 2>grain of salt.</v>

235
00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:41.650
<v Speaker 2>Each one is a pika gram.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's incomprehensible the</v>

236
00:12:41.651 --> 00:12:45.430
<v Speaker 2>detection level and how small that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really is.</v>

237
00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:49.000
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how many Pika grams did they find in</v>

238
00:12:49.001 --> 00:12:50.710
<v Speaker 2>his system?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's gone from,</v>

239
00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:52.420
<v Speaker 2>and I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll read through it here.</v>

240
00:12:52.421 --> 00:12:55.300
<v Speaker 2>So here's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's since the initial appearance of</v>

241
00:12:55.301 --> 00:12:59.020
<v Speaker 2>the n three metabolite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's what John's tests look like and</v>

242
00:12:59.021 --> 00:13:02.830
<v Speaker 2>those Pika gram reading.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the first one was collection date was</v>

243
00:13:02.831 --> 00:13:05.140
<v Speaker 2>July 28th,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2017.</v>

244
00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:09.340
<v Speaker 2>He had a concentration of ADP programs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Grams.</v>

245
00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:12.010
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me caution and I'll read something</v>

246
00:13:12.011 --> 00:13:14.380
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from an expert when you get down to</v>

247
00:13:14.381 --> 00:13:18.880
<v Speaker 2>these pika levels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the science is somewhat inexact</v>

248
00:13:18.881 --> 00:13:22.420
<v Speaker 2>because it's such a small amount.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the variable,</v>

249
00:13:22.421 --> 00:13:24.040
<v Speaker 2>the plus or minus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

250
00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:26.350
<v Speaker 2>can be anywhere from 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30.</v>

251
00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:30.820
<v Speaker 2>I've seen in some instances 50 or 60.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what this scientist name,</v>

252
00:13:30.821 --> 00:13:32.630
<v Speaker 2>his name is Larry bowers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

253
00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:35.710
<v Speaker 2>he was formally the PSA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Usada Science director.</v>

254
00:13:35.711 --> 00:13:40.711
<v Speaker 2>He's currently retired and independently</v>
<v Speaker 2>consults before that he ran an Olympic</v>

255
00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:46.110
<v Speaker 2>Olympic Committee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a accredited laboratory at the</v>

256
00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:48.550
<v Speaker 2>University of Indiana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy's got 20 to 25 years of</v>

257
00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:51.600
<v Speaker 2>anti-doping experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's what he,</v>

258
00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:53.650
<v Speaker 2>he told me about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

259
00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:54.723
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're,</v>

260
00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:58.090
<v Speaker 2>when you're analyzing small Pika gram</v>
<v Speaker 2>levels,</v>

261
00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:05.080
<v Speaker 2>although the two respective laboratories</v>
<v Speaker 2>report a concentration,</v>

262
00:14:05.081 --> 00:14:08.250
<v Speaker 2>I would caution against becoming too</v>
<v Speaker 2>fixated on the numbers.</v>

263
00:14:08.251 --> 00:14:10.030
<v Speaker 2>First,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the numbers are really estimates of</v>

264
00:14:10.031 --> 00:14:13.930
<v Speaker 2>concentration and probably should be</v>
<v Speaker 2>considered a range of about plus or</v>

265
00:14:13.931 --> 00:14:16.000
<v Speaker 2>minus 20 Pika grams per ml.</v>

266
00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:19.730
<v Speaker 2>And he said the December ninth result</v>
<v Speaker 2>would be in the range of John's.</v>

267
00:14:19.731 --> 00:14:22.780
<v Speaker 2>So we'll get to that between 60 and</v>
<v Speaker 2>102nd.</v>

268
00:14:22.781 --> 00:14:26.410
<v Speaker 2>While the adjustment of concentration by</v>
<v Speaker 2>specific gravity attempts to deal with</v>

269
00:14:26.411 --> 00:14:28.570
<v Speaker 2>the variability of urinary excretion</v>
<v Speaker 2>rates,</v>

270
00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:32.650
<v Speaker 2>it is an exact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is inexact and adds variability to</v>

271
00:14:32.651 --> 00:14:34.320
<v Speaker 2>the estimates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Finally,</v>

272
00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:37.060
<v Speaker 2>most importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>science has no clear understanding of</v>

273
00:14:37.061 --> 00:14:41.360
<v Speaker 2>the variance of urinary excretion of</v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs at ultra trace concentration.</v>

274
00:14:41.361 --> 00:14:43.000
<v Speaker 2>So basically saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

275
00:14:43.001 --> 00:14:45.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean we have a general idea how this</v>
<v Speaker 2>works in science,</v>

276
00:14:45.821 --> 00:14:49.000
<v Speaker 2>but and I think in this instance comes</v>
<v Speaker 2>to play,</v>

277
00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:53.360
<v Speaker 2>be real careful if you're going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy with the pseudoscience out there</v>

278
00:14:53.361 --> 00:14:54.260
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a second,</v>

279
00:14:54.261 --> 00:14:59.261
<v Speaker 2>John jumped from 20 to 60 from September</v>
<v Speaker 2>to December and that means he readjusted</v>

280
00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:03.620
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What he's saying here is slow your roll</v>

281
00:15:03.621 --> 00:15:04.241
<v Speaker 2>on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>

282
00:15:04.241 --> 00:15:09.241
<v Speaker 2>that it's such a small incomprehensible</v>
<v Speaker 2>level that we don't really know what</v>

283
00:15:09.291 --> 00:15:11.000
<v Speaker 2>those variances are going to look like.</v>

284
00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:15.140
<v Speaker 2>Now I think if we saw jumps and John</v>
<v Speaker 2>from single digit eight or nine Pika</v>

285
00:15:15.141 --> 00:15:18.110
<v Speaker 2>gram to multiple hundred digit Pika</v>
<v Speaker 2>grams,</v>

286
00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:21.200
<v Speaker 2>there would be a concern and maybe some</v>
<v Speaker 2>re administration,</v>

287
00:15:21.201 --> 00:15:25.460
<v Speaker 2>but the experts I've speaking to when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're talking variability of 10,</v>

288
00:15:25.461 --> 00:15:26.330
<v Speaker 2>20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30,</v>

289
00:15:26.331 --> 00:15:28.970
<v Speaker 2>40,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not that significant at the peak of</v>

290
00:15:28.971 --> 00:15:32.090
<v Speaker 2>gram level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the window where this longterm</v>

291
00:15:32.091 --> 00:15:35.720
<v Speaker 2>metabolites starts to express itself?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what you said,</v>

292
00:15:35.721 --> 00:15:37.670
<v Speaker 2>there's short term and there's medium</v>
<v Speaker 2>term.</v>

293
00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:40.830
<v Speaker 2>This is the long term.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How long does it take for the law?</v>

294
00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:43.950
<v Speaker 2>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have the answer to that and may</v>

295
00:15:43.951 --> 00:15:48.050
<v Speaker 2>be bank cubs report here and I would</v>
<v Speaker 2>encourage those that are home,</v>

296
00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:50.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>playing playing scientist at their</v>

297
00:15:50.481 --> 00:15:51.860
<v Speaker 2>computer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

298
00:15:51.861 --> 00:15:55.280
<v Speaker 2>the Journal of steroid biochemistry and</v>
<v Speaker 2>molecular biology,</v>

299
00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:57.080
<v Speaker 2>a Rut,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chink of rights,</v>

300
00:15:57.081 --> 00:16:02.081
<v Speaker 2>report detection and Mass Spec</v>
<v Speaker 2>spectrometric characterization of novel</v>

301
00:16:03.141 --> 00:16:06.980
<v Speaker 2>longterm to hydrochloric method,</v>
<v Speaker 2>testosterone metabolites in human urine.</v>

302
00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:09.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure when that longterm</v>
<v Speaker 2>metabolite,</v>

303
00:16:09.591 --> 00:16:12.350
<v Speaker 2>how long it takes to to show up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the problem though,</v>

304
00:16:12.351 --> 00:16:15.350
<v Speaker 2>with this substance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did a real brief study.</v>

305
00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:18.140
<v Speaker 2>My understanding is administered it to</v>
<v Speaker 2>himself.</v>

306
00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:23.050
<v Speaker 2>That's the only study that exists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oral Terenna Ball Dah,</v>

307
00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:27.350
<v Speaker 2>cmt to my understanding is not approved</v>
<v Speaker 2>for use for human consumption</v>

308
00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:30.800
<v Speaker 2>consumption anywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anywhere in any country.</v>

309
00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:35.900
<v Speaker 2>So you can't have clinical trials</v>
<v Speaker 2>ethically in the medical world because</v>

310
00:16:35.901 --> 00:16:39.260
<v Speaker 2>it's not legal to give this to human</v>
<v Speaker 2>beings.</v>

311
00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:40.970
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

312
00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:42.980
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're already kind of behind the eight</v>

313
00:16:42.981 --> 00:16:44.660
<v Speaker 2>ball here and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

314
00:16:44.661 --> 00:16:48.110
<v Speaker 2>as compared to other substances where</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can do clinical trials because</v>

315
00:16:48.111 --> 00:16:51.110
<v Speaker 2>they're readily available by</v>
<v Speaker 2>prescription or whatever.</v>

316
00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:55.610
<v Speaker 2>The substance is not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The substance was created by the East</v>

317
00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:59.060
<v Speaker 2>Germans in the seventies and eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And was part of their state sponsored</v>

318
00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:02.000
<v Speaker 2>doping program,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or they were doping their athletes.</v>

319
00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:05.000
<v Speaker 2>Can you correct me if I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I believe what I've read is that</v>

320
00:17:05.570 --> 00:17:08.300
<v Speaker 2>this is particularly effective when</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are cutting weight.</v>

321
00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:09.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

322
00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:12.770
<v Speaker 2>is that true or is this just more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about that.</v>

323
00:17:12.771 --> 00:17:16.630
<v Speaker 2>I think some may be confusing Torenna</v>
<v Speaker 2>ball with oral Terenna ball.</v>

324
00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:19.100
<v Speaker 2>Two completely different substances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually.</v>

325
00:17:19.101 --> 00:17:20.210
<v Speaker 2>Very important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

326
00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:22.400
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's very different effects on the</v>

327
00:17:22.401 --> 00:17:24.560
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's very different windows in terms</v>

328
00:17:24.561 --> 00:17:27.080
<v Speaker 2>of detection time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Explain that.</v>

329
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:29.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotta be really careful in this</v>

330
00:17:29.301 --> 00:17:33.050
<v Speaker 2>world of performance enhancing drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's names that are interchangeable.</v>

331
00:17:33.051 --> 00:17:34.320
<v Speaker 2>There's different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

332
00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:37.580
<v Speaker 2>chemical names where you change a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>bit of that chemical name.</v>

333
00:17:37.581 --> 00:17:40.280
<v Speaker 2>That could be me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a completely different substance.</v>

334
00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:42.950
<v Speaker 2>There's instances where the chemical</v>
<v Speaker 2>name is different,</v>

335
00:17:42.951 --> 00:17:46.850
<v Speaker 2>but the substance is actually the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when trying to compare two</v>

336
00:17:46.851 --> 00:17:48.080
<v Speaker 2>substances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

337
00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:50.070
<v Speaker 2>make sure if you're at home</v>

338
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:52.260
<v Speaker 3>doing that analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're comparing the right ones.</v>

339
00:17:52.261 --> 00:17:55.830
<v Speaker 3>Straight Terenna ball is different than</v>
<v Speaker 3>oral to rentable.</v>

340
00:17:55.831 --> 00:17:57.300
<v Speaker 3>What is the difference?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

341
00:17:57.450 --> 00:17:58.560
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't tell you,</v>

342
00:17:58.561 --> 00:18:02.430
<v Speaker 3>I'm not as familiar with Terenna ball</v>
<v Speaker 3>other than it's not oral to rentable,</v>

343
00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:04.590
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there is a difference in terms of</v>

344
00:18:04.591 --> 00:18:06.420
<v Speaker 3>the detection window.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

345
00:18:06.421 --> 00:18:07.231
<v Speaker 3>there would be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

346
00:18:07.231 --> 00:18:12.231
<v Speaker 3>different substances create and throw</v>
<v Speaker 3>out different metabolites and different</v>

347
00:18:12.331 --> 00:18:14.480
<v Speaker 3>substances have different detection</v>
<v Speaker 3>windows.</v>

348
00:18:14.481 --> 00:18:18.150
<v Speaker 3>So I haven't done my study and research</v>
<v Speaker 3>on straight to rent a ball other than</v>

349
00:18:18.151 --> 00:18:19.980
<v Speaker 3>knowing it's different than the</v>
<v Speaker 3>substance here.</v>

350
00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:20.963
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

351
00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:23.150
<v Speaker 3>Gregory Rich hank off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's how you say his last name,</v>

352
00:18:23.151 --> 00:18:26.820
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was the only guy to do an actual</v>

353
00:18:26.821 --> 00:18:28.440
<v Speaker 3>verified study.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>

354
00:18:28.441 --> 00:18:31.080
<v Speaker 3>Now has this study been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it been peer reviewed?</v>

355
00:18:31.081 --> 00:18:31.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it,</v>

356
00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:36.420
<v Speaker 3>it's published in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Journal of steroid biochemistry and</v>

357
00:18:36.421 --> 00:18:38.790
<v Speaker 3>molecular biology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in order to get something published</v>

358
00:18:38.791 --> 00:18:40.050
<v Speaker 3>it needs to be peer reviewed.</v>

359
00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:43.980
<v Speaker 3>So it's hasn't been replicated anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not that I'm aware of.</v>

360
00:18:43.981 --> 00:18:44.814
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's just.</v>

361
00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:46.950
<v Speaker 3>So we have one study which is really</v>
<v Speaker 3>fascinating.</v>

362
00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:49.380
<v Speaker 3>So we know that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

363
00:18:49.381 --> 00:18:51.660
<v Speaker 3>we know this is an effective steroid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know it works.</v>

364
00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:53.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The East Germans I think showed that</v>

365
00:18:53.761 --> 00:18:55.110
<v Speaker 3>they wouldn't be a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have been using it.</v>

366
00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:57.800
<v Speaker 3>It's not a difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not an easy,</v>

367
00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:00.000
<v Speaker 3>easy substance to get ahold of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

368
00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:03.060
<v Speaker 3>when it's not approved for use anywhere</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the world,</v>

369
00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:05.610
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's only available on the black market,</v>

370
00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:07.920
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you'd probably have to go to China to</v>

371
00:19:07.921 --> 00:19:12.490
<v Speaker 3>get it manufactured or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>research chemical supply company that's</v>

372
00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:14.670
<v Speaker 3>not supposed to be provided to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to humans.</v>

373
00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:16.140
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm certainly not attributing this to</v>

374
00:19:16.141 --> 00:19:19.110
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there were rumors.</v>

375
00:19:19.111 --> 00:19:24.111
<v Speaker 3>This was one discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was that one of the possible ways he</v>

376
00:19:24.391 --> 00:19:26.150
<v Speaker 3>could have ingested this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

377
00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:27.600
<v Speaker 3>and the speed very kind.</v>

378
00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:29.190
<v Speaker 3>John Likes to party.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

379
00:19:29.191 --> 00:19:31.740
<v Speaker 3>One of the things about partying as</v>
<v Speaker 3>people do cocaine,</v>

380
00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:34.980
<v Speaker 3>and one of the things about cocaine is</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes cocaine is cut with creatine.</v>

381
00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:38.790
<v Speaker 3>One of the things about creatine is</v>
<v Speaker 3>oftentimes you're buying cheap creatine.</v>

382
00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:41.700
<v Speaker 3>I spent like one of the things that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've had with on it on,</v>

383
00:19:41.701 --> 00:19:44.190
<v Speaker 3>it's our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our products are all third party</v>

384
00:19:44.191 --> 00:19:46.680
<v Speaker 3>verified,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in the initial goings,</v>

385
00:19:46.681 --> 00:19:50.100
<v Speaker 3>when we tried different manufacturers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially for Alpha brain,</v>

386
00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:53.910
<v Speaker 3>we found there were other trace elements</v>
<v Speaker 3>that were in Alpha brain that weren't</v>

387
00:19:53.911 --> 00:19:56.490
<v Speaker 3>supposed to be in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's because of the vats that they</v>

388
00:19:56.491 --> 00:20:00.870
<v Speaker 3>mix these things up with and one of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>things that we had heard was that</v>

389
00:20:00.871 --> 00:20:05.871
<v Speaker 3>creatine oftentimes is made in the same</v>
<v Speaker 3>place where they might be making oral</v>

390
00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:08.190
<v Speaker 3>Terenna Ball,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they might be making antibody,</v>

391
00:20:08.191 --> 00:20:11.580
<v Speaker 3>they might be making a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 3>different things and trace amounts of</v>

392
00:20:11.581 --> 00:20:16.230
<v Speaker 3>this stuff can get into the creatine and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they use creatine to cut cocaine with,</v>

393
00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:18.360
<v Speaker 3>is this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is this possible or am I just.</v>

394
00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:19.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>

395
00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:20.980
<v Speaker 3>It's absolutely a theory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

396
00:20:20.981 --> 00:20:21.510
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

397
00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:24.690
<v Speaker 3>I can't sit here and say that happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I will have heard similar things.</v>

398
00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:27.420
<v Speaker 3>I have heard some more things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know for a fact,</v>

399
00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:30.990
<v Speaker 3>based on my previous career,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I worked closely with the DEA.</v>

400
00:20:30.991 --> 00:20:34.230
<v Speaker 3>I was with the FDA.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I worked cases involving street</v>

401
00:20:34.231 --> 00:20:36.870
<v Speaker 3>distribution of recreational drugs</v>
<v Speaker 3>including cocaine.</v>

402
00:20:36.871 --> 00:20:41.430
<v Speaker 3>I know for a fact that creatine is one</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the most common substances that</v>

403
00:20:41.431 --> 00:20:45.720
<v Speaker 3>cocaine is cut with because I look some</v>
<v Speaker 3>more color,</v>

404
00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:47.980
<v Speaker 3>some more feel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So getting back to</v>

405
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:51.790
<v Speaker 2>Mclaren's arbitration decision,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is publicly available</v>

406
00:20:51.791 --> 00:20:56.740
<v Speaker 2>records so I'm not saying anything new</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it Mclaren addresses at least John's</v>

407
00:20:56.741 --> 00:21:00.580
<v Speaker 2>lifestyle around this time and he says</v>
<v Speaker 2>the athlete openly admitted to Usada</v>

408
00:21:00.581 --> 00:21:04.600
<v Speaker 2>that prior to and for a period of time</v>
<v Speaker 2>after the reporting of his second</v>

409
00:21:04.601 --> 00:21:08.140
<v Speaker 2>adverse analytical finding on July 28,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2017,</v>

410
00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:12.310
<v Speaker 2>the athlete used illicit so called</v>
<v Speaker 2>street drugs including cocaine.</v>

411
00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:15.950
<v Speaker 2>Now for me to sit here and say that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>where it came from.</v>

412
00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:20.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that he's talking about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>athlete admitted</v>

413
00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:26.110
<v Speaker 2>that prior to and for a period of time</v>
<v Speaker 2>after the reporting of his second</v>

414
00:21:26.111 --> 00:21:30.640
<v Speaker 2>adverse analytical finding on July 27,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2017 admitted.</v>

415
00:21:30.641 --> 00:21:35.050
<v Speaker 2>So before that test and sometime after.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

416
00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:38.380
<v Speaker 2>So does that make sense though?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's cut,</v>

417
00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:43.360
<v Speaker 2>that's what were the source of it is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does it make sense that that would show</v>

418
00:21:43.361 --> 00:21:45.640
<v Speaker 2>up as a longterm metabolite?</v>

419
00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:50.670
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't it need a long time in the body</v>
<v Speaker 2>to digest or do we not know enough about</v>

420
00:21:50.831 --> 00:21:53.020
<v Speaker 2>the window of time?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

421
00:21:53.021 --> 00:21:55.390
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if we know enough about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>window of time.</v>

422
00:21:55.391 --> 00:21:55.930
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

423
00:21:55.930 --> 00:22:00.930
<v Speaker 2>my theory and looking at it is even if</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a small amount of the oral</v>

424
00:22:01.541 --> 00:22:05.380
<v Speaker 2>Terenna ball in that it's going to for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>period of time,</v>

425
00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:10.120
<v Speaker 2>show that parent compound at a small</v>
<v Speaker 2>picogram amount in the short and midterm</v>

426
00:22:10.121 --> 00:22:12.910
<v Speaker 2>metabolites in the small Pika gram</v>
<v Speaker 2>amount.</v>

427
00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:16.600
<v Speaker 2>We have never seen those in the history</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Johns testing.</v>

428
00:22:16.601 --> 00:22:21.400
<v Speaker 2>It's only this longterm metabolite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that may be indication that it</v>

429
00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:23.860
<v Speaker 2>occurred.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe even prior to what we're talking</v>

430
00:22:23.861 --> 00:22:27.700
<v Speaker 2>about here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it something that could be</v>

431
00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:30.790
<v Speaker 2>accentuated in some way by the weight</v>
<v Speaker 2>cutting process?</v>

432
00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:33.340
<v Speaker 2>I absolutely think that could be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>factor.</v>

433
00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:36.430
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are studies not necessarily with</v>

434
00:22:36.431 --> 00:22:39.520
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but another substance clomiphene and</v>

435
00:22:39.521 --> 00:22:40.110
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want,</v>

436
00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:43.870
<v Speaker 2>while I'm cautioning people to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>careful about comparing different</v>

437
00:22:43.871 --> 00:22:47.380
<v Speaker 2>substances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the commonality between Clomiphene,</v>

438
00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:50.890
<v Speaker 2>which there are multiple clinical</v>
<v Speaker 2>studies on because it is approved for</v>

439
00:22:50.891 --> 00:22:55.891
<v Speaker 2>use to be distributed to humans and oral</v>
<v Speaker 2>Terenna ball is they're both chlorinated</v>

440
00:22:56.440 --> 00:23:01.440
<v Speaker 2>so they both contain a chlorine atom on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the molecule and there is a recently</v>

441
00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:06.900
<v Speaker 2>published study on clomiphene and its</v>
<v Speaker 2>excretion rates again,</v>

442
00:23:08.441 --> 00:23:10.060
<v Speaker 2>for those at home that want to look it</v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

443
00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:13.690
<v Speaker 2>The study was published in the endocrine</v>
<v Speaker 2>society publication.</v>

444
00:23:13.691 --> 00:23:18.010
<v Speaker 2>It's pure reviewed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The name of it is hpt axis effects and</v>

445
00:23:18.011 --> 00:23:21.490
<v Speaker 2>urinary detection following clomiphene</v>
<v Speaker 2>administration and males.</v>

446
00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:24.470
<v Speaker 2>So what they did is they basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

447
00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:26.500
<v Speaker 2>got a group of males,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

448
00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:31.000
<v Speaker 2>gave them a one month cycle of</v>
<v Speaker 2>clomiphene,</v>

449
00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:34.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think 25 milligrams a day and then had</v>

450
00:23:34.451 --> 00:23:39.451
<v Speaker 2>them get off and then continue to look</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the urine up to 261 days after.</v>

451
00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:45.040
<v Speaker 2>And what you saw and what you see in</v>
<v Speaker 2>this study is that pulsing effect.</v>

452
00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:46.270
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

453
00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:48.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking at some of the study</v>
<v Speaker 2>subjects here.</v>

454
00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:51.200
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>subject one on day one,</v>

455
00:23:51.201 --> 00:23:56.201
<v Speaker 2>21 still showed 147 Pika grams of</v>
<v Speaker 2>clomiphene day one,</v>

456
00:23:56.361 --> 00:24:01.361
<v Speaker 2>28 showed 174 pika grams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Day One 35 shows nothing.</v>

457
00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:06.020
<v Speaker 2>He's below the minimum courting a</v>
<v Speaker 2>reporting limit.</v>

458
00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:09.950
<v Speaker 2>And then day one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>49 is back up to 2:36.</v>

459
00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:12.320
<v Speaker 2>There are one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>

460
00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:13.670
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four,</v>

461
00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:18.020
<v Speaker 2>five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six out of I think 12 subjects in that</v>

462
00:24:18.021 --> 00:24:23.021
<v Speaker 2>study that showed this pulsing effect of</v>
<v Speaker 2>this chlorinated substance coming and</v>

463
00:24:23.601 --> 00:24:24.434
<v Speaker 2>going.</v>

464
00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:25.410
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

465
00:24:25.411 --> 00:24:27.500
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's different than oral Terenna Ball,</v>

466
00:24:27.501 --> 00:24:32.150
<v Speaker 2>but it has that common factor of being</v>
<v Speaker 2>chlorinated in this study.</v>

467
00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:33.920
<v Speaker 2>They do talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

468
00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:38.120
<v Speaker 2>a fat tissue called the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me look this up and make sure I got</v>

469
00:24:38.121 --> 00:24:39.590
<v Speaker 2>this right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Adipose tissue,</v>

470
00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:42.890
<v Speaker 2>this is fat that surrounds the internal</v>
<v Speaker 2>organs.</v>

471
00:24:42.891 --> 00:24:45.710
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the last things that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>body burns when it's going,</v>

472
00:24:45.711 --> 00:24:47.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>starving itself and going to fat.</v>

473
00:24:47.571 --> 00:24:49.730
<v Speaker 2>It protects those organs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

474
00:24:49.731 --> 00:24:51.750
<v Speaker 2>you look at these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

475
00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:55.400
<v Speaker 2>extreme weight gains and cuts that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>UFC athlete goes through.</v>

476
00:24:55.401 --> 00:24:59.750
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you're going to find</v>
<v Speaker 2>possibly another human subject anywhere</v>

477
00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:04.850
<v Speaker 2>that goes through putting weight on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other than maybe that I don't think</v>

478
00:25:04.851 --> 00:25:07.880
<v Speaker 2>Olympic wrestling matches with an MMA</v>
<v Speaker 2>fighter,</v>

479
00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:09.230
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>goes through,</v>

480
00:25:09.231 --> 00:25:12.530
<v Speaker 2>at least in my experience over these</v>
<v Speaker 2>three or four years talking to those in</v>

481
00:25:12.531 --> 00:25:15.820
<v Speaker 2>the Olympic world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're at the extreme and it's</v>

482
00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:17.630
<v Speaker 2>something obviously we've talked about</v>
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>

483
00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:19.920
<v Speaker 2>We're trying to curtail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

484
00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:22.610
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's clearly never been a study for</v>

485
00:25:22.611 --> 00:25:27.320
<v Speaker 2>anybody who dehydrates and readwrite</v>
<v Speaker 2>hydrates themselves to the extent that</v>

486
00:25:27.321 --> 00:25:30.530
<v Speaker 2>some of our athletes do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could never find that would never be</v>

487
00:25:30.531 --> 00:25:34.070
<v Speaker 2>anybody with any ethics that would</v>
<v Speaker 2>support a study because some of that</v>

488
00:25:34.071 --> 00:25:37.250
<v Speaker 2>dehydration exceeds World Health</v>
<v Speaker 2>Organization standards.</v>

489
00:25:37.251 --> 00:25:39.560
<v Speaker 2>So there's no studies out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

490
00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:41.690
<v Speaker 2>on this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But clearly,</v>

491
00:25:41.691 --> 00:25:43.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking from afar I,</v>

492
00:25:43.071 --> 00:25:46.940
<v Speaker 2>I'd say that it likely has some impact</v>
<v Speaker 2>over what's being released by this</v>

493
00:25:46.941 --> 00:25:49.880
<v Speaker 2>adipose tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should certainly talk about that in</v>

494
00:25:49.881 --> 00:25:51.950
<v Speaker 2>the future,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the week cutting aspect of it.</v>

495
00:25:51.951 --> 00:25:55.790
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this adipose tissue loss at extreme</v>

496
00:25:55.791 --> 00:26:00.670
<v Speaker 2>weight cuts could potentially be the</v>
<v Speaker 2>reason why this stuff is excreting</v>

497
00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:01.331
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

498
00:26:01.331 --> 00:26:04.070
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely a theory out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about microdosing?</v>

499
00:26:04.550 --> 00:26:09.550
<v Speaker 2>So here's the thing with microdosing</v>
<v Speaker 2>microdosing has done with endogenous</v>

500
00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:12.120
<v Speaker 2>substances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so only test it.</v>

501
00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:13.880
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean someone could try it with</v>

502
00:26:13.881 --> 00:26:16.940
<v Speaker 2>something else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the reason you microdose with</v>

503
00:26:16.941 --> 00:26:20.180
<v Speaker 2>endogenous substances is there already</v>
<v Speaker 2>produced in the body.</v>

504
00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:21.800
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the theory of,</v>

505
00:26:21.801 --> 00:26:24.200
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to microdose oral terminable,</v>

506
00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:26.960
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oral terenna balls still producing these</v>

507
00:26:26.961 --> 00:26:30.920
<v Speaker 2>short term and longterm metabolites in</v>
<v Speaker 2>theory,</v>

508
00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:35.980
<v Speaker 2>whether you're taking 100 milligrams or</v>
<v Speaker 2>one milligram of oral Terenna Ball,</v>

509
00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:40.310
<v Speaker 2>those excretion rates of those</v>
<v Speaker 2>metabolites are still going to be</v>

510
00:26:40.311 --> 00:26:42.140
<v Speaker 2>consistent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to be in a much smaller,</v>

511
00:26:42.141 --> 00:26:46.860
<v Speaker 2>lesser a way to those excretion rates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there a way to mask that in some way?</v>

512
00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:49.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm not aware of any.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go ahead.</v>

513
00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:52.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only study we have is Gregory,</v>

514
00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:53.620
<v Speaker 2>correct?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

515
00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:55.260
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

516
00:26:55.261 --> 00:26:57.450
<v Speaker 2>just taking it from a common sense</v>
<v Speaker 2>approach.</v>

517
00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:00.960
<v Speaker 2>It's certainly those that know about</v>
<v Speaker 2>micro grossing,</v>

518
00:27:00.961 --> 00:27:03.750
<v Speaker 2>know that you microdose with indogenous</v>
<v Speaker 2>substances,</v>

519
00:27:03.751 --> 00:27:06.870
<v Speaker 2>things that are already appearing in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>body so your body knows what to do with</v>

520
00:27:06.871 --> 00:27:09.000
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>knows what to do and you're fooling,</v>

521
00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:11.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only are these metabolizing and</v>

522
00:27:11.521 --> 00:27:14.940
<v Speaker 2>there's no metabolites of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you could also be fooling the</v>

523
00:27:14.941 --> 00:27:16.170
<v Speaker 2>biological passport.</v>

524
00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:19.230
<v Speaker 2>That's the concern I think and why</v>
<v Speaker 2>people microdose.</v>

525
00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:23.160
<v Speaker 2>So you saw it as looking not only</v>
<v Speaker 2>testing for specific substances,</v>

526
00:27:23.161 --> 00:27:27.060
<v Speaker 2>but our testosterone epitestosterone</v>
<v Speaker 2>ratio is going up.</v>

527
00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:30.930
<v Speaker 2>They're looking at at blood values,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many young red blood cells,</v>

528
00:27:30.931 --> 00:27:34.470
<v Speaker 2>how many mature red blood cells.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So microdosing and those two areas</v>

529
00:27:34.471 --> 00:27:38.070
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't set off alarms in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>biological passport world.</v>

530
00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:40.500
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never heard personally of</v>

531
00:27:40.501 --> 00:27:44.640
<v Speaker 2>microdosing of exoticness substances</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are not found in the body</v>

532
00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:47.280
<v Speaker 2>microdosing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my understanding is done with things</v>

533
00:27:47.281 --> 00:27:51.660
<v Speaker 2>that are endogenous body for people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are not familiar with this terminology,</v>

534
00:27:51.661 --> 00:27:55.720
<v Speaker 2>we're just talking about microdosing</v>
<v Speaker 2>performance enhancing drugs because a</v>

535
00:27:55.820 --> 00:28:00.820
<v Speaker 2>microdosing in today's world is a very</v>
<v Speaker 2>common thing with mushrooms and Lsd and</v>

536
00:28:01.231 --> 00:28:01.980
<v Speaker 2>a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

537
00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:06.330
<v Speaker 2>I saw a ton of microdosing in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>cycling world that was tested for</v>

538
00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:09.180
<v Speaker 2>testosterone epo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hgh,</v>

539
00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:11.040
<v Speaker 2>all those natural occurring in the body.</v>

540
00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:16.360
<v Speaker 2>And so they don't produce any really a</v>
<v Speaker 2>red flag metabolites if you do them at</v>

541
00:28:17.191 --> 00:28:18.510
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very small levels,</v>

542
00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:20.940
<v Speaker 2>they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the parent will clear quickly not</v>

543
00:28:20.941 --> 00:28:24.210
<v Speaker 2>produce any metabolites and will not</v>
<v Speaker 2>throw off the biological passport</v>

544
00:28:24.211 --> 00:28:25.710
<v Speaker 2>analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

545
00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:28.980
<v Speaker 2>is there a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you mean when Victor Conte came out</v>

546
00:28:28.981 --> 00:28:31.790
<v Speaker 2>with a clear and all that stuff with</v>
<v Speaker 2>bulk?</v>

547
00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:34.470
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were fooling people.</v>

548
00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:35.363
<v Speaker 2>Is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it,</v>

549
00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:36.870
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things we've talked about</v>

550
00:28:36.871 --> 00:28:41.490
<v Speaker 2>before is that it's a constant race to</v>
<v Speaker 2>try to keep up with more advanced</v>

551
00:28:41.491 --> 00:28:43.140
<v Speaker 2>cheaters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

552
00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:44.730
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's interesting in this,</v>

553
00:28:44.731 --> 00:28:46.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>without to talk to you and maybe the</v>

554
00:28:46.621 --> 00:28:48.600
<v Speaker 2>first time we did talk a couple years</v>
<v Speaker 2>ago,</v>

555
00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:50.250
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's come a long way from them,</v>

556
00:28:50.251 --> 00:28:52.590
<v Speaker 2>but clearly if I've ever talked to you</v>
<v Speaker 2>15,</v>

557
00:28:52.591 --> 00:28:55.170
<v Speaker 2>16,</v>
<v Speaker 2>17 years ago when I got my start in the</v>

558
00:28:55.171 --> 00:28:58.710
<v Speaker 2>anti-doping world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have told you definitively the</v>

559
00:28:58.711 --> 00:29:01.830
<v Speaker 2>testing is way behind what's being used</v>
<v Speaker 2>out there.</v>

560
00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:03.870
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were testing,</v>

561
00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:07.470
<v Speaker 2>able to test to multiple nanogram</v>
<v Speaker 2>limits.</v>

562
00:29:07.471 --> 00:29:11.520
<v Speaker 2>That's as far down as we can go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now they can go down to single digit</v>

563
00:29:11.521 --> 00:29:13.980
<v Speaker 2>Pika Gram.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's another professional sports</v>

564
00:29:13.981 --> 00:29:18.981
<v Speaker 2>league out there that recently had a one</v>
<v Speaker 2>pika gram and three metabolite case.</v>

565
00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:22.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean do the math coming down from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

566
00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:26.330
<v Speaker 2>four or five nanograms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which used to be the lower limit now to</v>

567
00:29:26.331 --> 00:29:29.940
<v Speaker 2>one Pika gram 10,000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20,000 times.</v>

568
00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:35.030
<v Speaker 2>I am almost under the theory that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>pendulum has swung maybe a little bit</v>

569
00:29:35.401 --> 00:29:39.990
<v Speaker 2>too far in the other direction and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that certainly is part of my job to the</v>

570
00:29:39.991 --> 00:29:40.771
<v Speaker 2>UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

571
00:29:40.771 --> 00:29:43.720
<v Speaker 2>I want catch every intentional cheater</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's out there.</v>

572
00:29:43.721 --> 00:29:46.000
<v Speaker 2>I want to make sure we have a rock solid</v>
<v Speaker 2>program.</v>

573
00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:48.940
<v Speaker 2>Use all the latest and greatest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

574
00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:50.950
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>techniques to do it.</v>

575
00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:54.820
<v Speaker 2>But I also want to keep an eye on it to</v>
<v Speaker 2>make sure it's being administrated</v>

576
00:29:54.821 --> 00:29:55.654
<v Speaker 2>fairly.</v>

577
00:29:55.870 --> 00:29:58.700
<v Speaker 2>And when you're getting down to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>detection of one,</v>

578
00:29:58.701 --> 00:30:00.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>single digit Pika grams.</v>

579
00:30:00.970 --> 00:30:05.530
<v Speaker 2>I have a concern that what kind of level</v>
<v Speaker 2>of sensitivity we're talking about.</v>

580
00:30:05.531 --> 00:30:10.000
<v Speaker 2>Are we going to talk about environmental</v>
<v Speaker 2>contamination where you walk through a</v>

581
00:30:10.001 --> 00:30:13.240
<v Speaker 2>room and somebody has just opened a</v>
<v Speaker 2>container of something and there's,</v>

582
00:30:13.270 --> 00:30:15.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>minuscule powders in the air.</v>

583
00:30:15.850 --> 00:30:19.720
<v Speaker 2>There are documented cases that some of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the regularly prescribed prescription</v>

584
00:30:19.721 --> 00:30:21.520
<v Speaker 2>drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>specifically,</v>

585
00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:24.760
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>diuretics are getting in water supplies</v>

586
00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:26.230
<v Speaker 2>in some areas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

587
00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:30.550
<v Speaker 2>you get a lot of old people on them that</v>
<v Speaker 2>flush their old pills down the toilet.</v>

588
00:30:30.850 --> 00:30:34.870
<v Speaker 2>There's documented cases of it getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the water supply and being</v>

589
00:30:34.871 --> 00:30:39.070
<v Speaker 2>detectable at that peak of gram level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you've got to be really,</v>

590
00:30:39.071 --> 00:30:40.930
<v Speaker 2>really careful about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>

591
00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:44.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this case exemplifies that you saw it</v>

592
00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:49.650
<v Speaker 2>and really the world antidoping agency</v>
<v Speaker 2>world and community are aware of that.</v>

593
00:30:50.370 --> 00:30:51.101
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

594
00:30:51.101 --> 00:30:55.290
<v Speaker 2>with greater sensitivity and testing in</v>
<v Speaker 2>my opinion because you know,</v>

595
00:30:55.600 --> 00:31:00.600
<v Speaker 2>makes greater responsibility to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>objective and look fairly at what really</v>

596
00:31:00.641 --> 00:31:03.220
<v Speaker 2>we're doing here when we're detecting in</v>
<v Speaker 2>that small amount.</v>

597
00:31:03.610 --> 00:31:07.900
<v Speaker 2>But this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this test of John's where he's testing</v>

598
00:31:07.901 --> 00:31:12.901
<v Speaker 2>for the same level of peak of grams</v>
<v Speaker 2>today as he was in July of 2017.</v>

599
00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:17.380
<v Speaker 2>Is it safe to say that this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>unprecedented?</v>

600
00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:23.200
<v Speaker 2>Repeat that again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that John's test for the same levels of</v>

601
00:31:23.201 --> 00:31:28.201
<v Speaker 2>peak grams of these metabolites in 2018</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he was testing for in 2017 with</v>

602
00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:31.570
<v Speaker 2>this is unprecedented.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

603
00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:34.630
<v Speaker 2>the answer's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so maybe unprecedented in the UFC</v>

604
00:31:34.631 --> 00:31:37.660
<v Speaker 2>program,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what the United States anti-doping</v>

605
00:31:37.670 --> 00:31:42.040
<v Speaker 2>hhc did over these last five or six</v>
<v Speaker 2>months as they reached out to the</v>

606
00:31:42.041 --> 00:31:44.980
<v Speaker 2>science community outside the scope of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the UFC,</v>

607
00:31:45.370 --> 00:31:48.040
<v Speaker 2>they reached out to other professional</v>
<v Speaker 2>sports organizations.</v>

608
00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:52.090
<v Speaker 2>They reached out to other to</v>
<v Speaker 2>laboratories and what they were seeing</v>

609
00:31:52.390 --> 00:31:57.390
<v Speaker 2>was multiple instances of this pulsing</v>
<v Speaker 2>effect where over time you would see a</v>

610
00:31:58.031 --> 00:31:58.864
<v Speaker 2>reading.</v>

611
00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:03.010
<v Speaker 2>The next test it would go away and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>next time you'd see that reading again</v>

612
00:32:03.011 --> 00:32:06.970
<v Speaker 2>maybe back up to or even above this much</v>
<v Speaker 2>time was correct.</v>

613
00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:08.830
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you see that in the.</v>

614
00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.280
<v Speaker 2>In the clomiphene study here too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean almost 260.</v>

615
00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:15.370
<v Speaker 2>They stopped the study,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it was still appearing and Pika</v>

616
00:32:15.371 --> 00:32:20.371
<v Speaker 2>gram levels in some subjects and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>stopped the study at 261 days and you</v>

617
00:32:20.621 --> 00:32:23.260
<v Speaker 2>see those numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was reading to you see this one</v>

618
00:32:23.261 --> 00:32:27.310
<v Speaker 2>subject at one 74,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's negative the next time and then he</v>

619
00:32:27.311 --> 00:32:29.770
<v Speaker 2>pops up to two in the two hundreds</v>
<v Speaker 2>after.</v>

620
00:32:29.771 --> 00:32:32.380
<v Speaker 2>So it's actually more than the time</v>
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>

621
00:32:32.381 --> 00:32:33.790
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>apples and oranges,</v>

622
00:32:33.791 --> 00:32:37.000
<v Speaker 2>different substances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the commonality here is chlorinated</v>

623
00:32:37.001 --> 00:32:40.880
<v Speaker 2>substance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So is it safe to say that this is an</v>

624
00:32:40.881 --> 00:32:45.881
<v Speaker 2>emerging science and that we're still</v>
<v Speaker 2>learning and understanding this as we go</v>

625
00:32:47.181 --> 00:32:48.350
<v Speaker 2>along?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

626
00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:49.640
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's still very young.</v>

627
00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:50.570
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first,</v>

628
00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:53.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles were</v>

629
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:57.650
<v Speaker 2>the established the first drug testing</v>
<v Speaker 2>laboratory by Dr Catlin.</v>

630
00:32:58.130 --> 00:32:59.540
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so really,</v>

631
00:32:59.541 --> 00:33:01.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the scope of science going back to</v>

632
00:33:01.821 --> 00:33:04.130
<v Speaker 2>the earliest days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they're talking about,</v>

633
00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:05.023
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

634
00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:06.800
<v Speaker 2>30,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30 years,</v>

635
00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:08.210
<v Speaker 2>30,</v>
<v Speaker 2>35 years.</v>

636
00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:09.740
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

637
00:33:09.770 --> 00:33:12.260
<v Speaker 2>when I started off in this 16 or 17</v>
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>

638
00:33:12.261 --> 00:33:15.580
<v Speaker 2>the science still wasn't good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were unable to detect anything in</v>

639
00:33:15.581 --> 00:33:17.210
<v Speaker 2>the Pika gram level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

640
00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:18.610
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

641
00:33:18.610 --> 00:33:20.420
<v Speaker 2>for reference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very interesting.</v>

642
00:33:20.421 --> 00:33:24.260
<v Speaker 2>So the water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world anti-doping agencies accredits</v>

643
00:33:24.261 --> 00:33:28.640
<v Speaker 2>laboratories across the world and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>have certain standards that those</v>

644
00:33:28.641 --> 00:33:32.870
<v Speaker 2>laboratories must meet or to retain that</v>
<v Speaker 2>accreditation.</v>

645
00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:36.020
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and keep that accreditation so they have</v>

646
00:33:36.050 --> 00:33:40.130
<v Speaker 2>a technical document called the minimum</v>
<v Speaker 2>required performance levels of their</v>

647
00:33:40.131 --> 00:33:42.440
<v Speaker 2>laboratories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So would they tell the laboratories as</v>

648
00:33:42.441 --> 00:33:46.190
<v Speaker 2>you must detect these substances down to</v>
<v Speaker 2>this amount?</v>

649
00:33:46.610 --> 00:33:48.290
<v Speaker 2>If you can't get them down to this</v>
<v Speaker 2>amount,</v>

650
00:33:48.291 --> 00:33:50.750
<v Speaker 2>then you can't have an accreditation</v>
<v Speaker 2>from water.</v>

651
00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:56.210
<v Speaker 2>So the class of substances that oral</v>
<v Speaker 2>Terenna ball would be in,</v>

652
00:33:56.590 --> 00:34:01.460
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which would be other anabolic agents,</v>

653
00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:06.820
<v Speaker 2>the required minimum level that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>must detect two is only two nanograms.</v>

654
00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:09.830
<v Speaker 2>So look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why did he even says,</v>

655
00:34:09.831 --> 00:34:13.160
<v Speaker 2>as long as you can get to two nanograms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can retain our accreditation.</v>

656
00:34:13.161 --> 00:34:14.960
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's happening is an arms race in</v>

657
00:34:14.961 --> 00:34:16.880
<v Speaker 2>these laboratories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're saying,</v>

658
00:34:16.881 --> 00:34:17.630
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the twos,</v>

659
00:34:17.630 --> 00:34:21.410
<v Speaker 2>the minimum standard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can get down further and you know,</v>

660
00:34:21.411 --> 00:34:24.950
<v Speaker 2>these are private entities that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking for,</v>

661
00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:26.930
<v Speaker 2>for customers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to be able to reach out and say,</v>

662
00:34:26.931 --> 00:34:30.320
<v Speaker 2>well even the law tells us to is as low</v>
<v Speaker 2>as we need to go.</v>

663
00:34:30.321 --> 00:34:34.640
<v Speaker 2>We can go down to one pika gram.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in a sense,</v>

664
00:34:34.641 --> 00:34:36.740
<v Speaker 2>maybe you need to slow the reigns on</v>
<v Speaker 2>that a little bit.</v>

665
00:34:36.741 --> 00:34:41.330
<v Speaker 2>That we're getting too far and too</v>
<v Speaker 2>sensitive of a level of detection when</v>

666
00:34:41.331 --> 00:34:46.331
<v Speaker 2>it comes to implementing a fair program</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you can't determine where a pika</v>

667
00:34:47.091 --> 00:34:48.230
<v Speaker 2>gram ca came from.</v>

668
00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:50.750
<v Speaker 2>You could be breathing again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>contaminated air,</v>

669
00:34:51.140 --> 00:34:54.440
<v Speaker 2>drinking contaminated water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gets real dangerous when you get down</v>

670
00:34:54.441 --> 00:34:57.830
<v Speaker 2>that low.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The how does this reflect on past</v>

671
00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:01.660
<v Speaker 2>suspensions?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what when you deal with someone,</v>

672
00:35:01.710 --> 00:35:03.770
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's bring up Frank Mir for example.</v>

673
00:35:03.830 --> 00:35:07.230
<v Speaker 2>Didn't Frank Mir also test for oral turn</v>
<v Speaker 2>a ball.</v>

674
00:35:07.231 --> 00:35:08.840
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to get back to Frank Mir,</v>

675
00:35:08.841 --> 00:35:11.630
<v Speaker 2>but let's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's go back to John and this instance</v>

676
00:35:11.631 --> 00:35:13.580
<v Speaker 2>and why you saw that has come out and</v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

677
00:35:13.581 --> 00:35:15.830
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not a violation.</v>

678
00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:19.310
<v Speaker 2>So if you go to the water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world anti-doping code,</v>

679
00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:22.430
<v Speaker 2>there's a section 10 point seven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>point four,</v>

680
00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:27.460
<v Speaker 2>point one are UFC program basically</v>
<v Speaker 2>mirrors that and we're bringing that up</v>

681
00:35:28.971 --> 00:35:32.450
<v Speaker 2>on the screen there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for purposes of imposing sanctions</v>

682
00:35:32.451 --> 00:35:35.690
<v Speaker 2>under tab 10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>point seven and anti doping rule</v>

683
00:35:35.691 --> 00:35:38.010
<v Speaker 2>violation will only be a second</v>

684
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:40.980
<v Speaker 3>violation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If the anti-doping organization can</v>

685
00:35:40.981 --> 00:35:44.730
<v Speaker 3>establish the athlete or other person</v>
<v Speaker 3>committed the second anti-doping rule</v>

686
00:35:44.731 --> 00:35:48.810
<v Speaker 3>violation after the athlete or other</v>
<v Speaker 3>person received notice pursuant to</v>

687
00:35:48.811 --> 00:35:52.110
<v Speaker 3>article seven,</v>
<v Speaker 3>etc. This is what's known as a double</v>

688
00:35:52.111 --> 00:35:56.160
<v Speaker 3>jeopardy clause.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Be sancTion guy tests positive for</v>

689
00:35:56.161 --> 00:36:00.510
<v Speaker 3>something and if he's test positive for</v>
<v Speaker 3>the exact same substance that is still</v>

690
00:36:00.511 --> 00:36:03.960
<v Speaker 3>in his system a year later or whatever</v>
<v Speaker 3>the amount of time is,</v>

691
00:36:03.961 --> 00:36:06.540
<v Speaker 3>you don't include that as a new positive</v>
<v Speaker 3>test.</v>

692
00:36:06.570 --> 00:36:09.780
<v Speaker 3>One more thing has to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Science has to determine that there</v>

693
00:36:09.781 --> 00:36:14.670
<v Speaker 3>hasn't been a real administration so</v>
<v Speaker 3>test positive for the same substance and</v>

694
00:36:14.671 --> 00:36:17.310
<v Speaker 3>science says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>based on all the numbers we see,</v>

695
00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:21.850
<v Speaker 3>there's no evidence of any readminister</v>
<v Speaker 3>ration and the non evidence of the</v>

696
00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:27.020
<v Speaker 3>administration is the lack of short term</v>
<v Speaker 3>and medium term can go and never ever.</v>

697
00:36:27.841 --> 00:36:32.380
<v Speaker 3>And john cyran issue though that this is</v>
<v Speaker 3>only one test that gregory would cenk</v>

698
00:36:32.381 --> 00:36:37.381
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] test is the only study that</v>
<v Speaker 3>showed that these medium and short term</v>

699
00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:39.510
<v Speaker 3>metabolites exist.</v>

700
00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:42.840
<v Speaker 3>It it's the only study,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think then if there's only one</v>

701
00:36:42.841 --> 00:36:45.000
<v Speaker 3>study,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to go to anecdotal evidence.</v>

702
00:36:45.001 --> 00:36:49.170
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do studies on ufc employees because</v>

703
00:36:51.450 --> 00:36:55.380
<v Speaker 3>they'll do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oral to rentable is illegal to</v>

704
00:36:55.381 --> 00:36:58.920
<v Speaker 3>distribute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go in any country throughout the world.</v>

705
00:36:58.921 --> 00:37:01.320
<v Speaker 3>It's really legal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Contracts go.</v>

706
00:37:01.321 --> 00:37:02.580
<v Speaker 3>They just let you do whatever you want</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do.</v>

707
00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:04.290
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe we can look into that,</v>

708
00:37:04.291 --> 00:37:07.380
<v Speaker 3>but shelby maybe up for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the reason for living there.</v>

709
00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:08.440
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

710
00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:09.330
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

711
00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:13.470
<v Speaker 3>I have a problem with that in that we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>relying on one study.</v>

712
00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:17.580
<v Speaker 3>This seems to me to be like a critical</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing that could affect.</v>

713
00:37:18.050 --> 00:37:19.170
<v Speaker 3>I mean we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

714
00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:21.710
<v Speaker 3>we're hoping and we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

715
00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:25.050
<v Speaker 3>we're putting faith in this study that</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the only way that these</v>

716
00:37:25.051 --> 00:37:28.650
<v Speaker 3>metabolites express themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it possiBle that,</v>

717
00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:30.260
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

718
00:37:30.270 --> 00:37:33.480
<v Speaker 3>theSe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you see what the pulsing effect</v>

719
00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:38.010
<v Speaker 3>that you see positive effects and</v>
<v Speaker 3>negative or positive results and</v>

720
00:37:38.011 --> 00:37:42.930
<v Speaker 3>negative results that these short term</v>
<v Speaker 3>and medium term metabolites don't always</v>

721
00:37:42.931 --> 00:37:46.950
<v Speaker 3>express themselves and that what we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>considering a longterm metabolite could</v>

722
00:37:46.951 --> 00:37:48.780
<v Speaker 3>in fact just be a metabolite.</v>

723
00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:51.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I guess it's possible,</v>

724
00:37:51.571 --> 00:37:53.520
<v Speaker 3>but what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you going to sanction an athlete</v>

725
00:37:53.521 --> 00:37:56.820
<v Speaker 3>again because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>potentially it's possible.</v>

726
00:37:56.821 --> 00:37:59.400
<v Speaker 3>And then the theory of the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't do that.</v>

727
00:37:59.401 --> 00:38:03.660
<v Speaker 3>Let me read to you real quick what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what these experts came out at in terms</v>

728
00:38:03.661 --> 00:38:08.661
<v Speaker 3>of administration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Dr. Daniel eichner runs the salt lake</v>

729
00:38:08.701 --> 00:38:10.710
<v Speaker 3>city.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called a smart sports medicine</v>

730
00:38:10.711 --> 00:38:12.900
<v Speaker 3>research testing laboratory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or myrdal.</v>

731
00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:16.320
<v Speaker 3>They're one of two water accredited</v>
<v Speaker 3>laboratories in the United States.</v>

732
00:38:16.321 --> 00:38:18.570
<v Speaker 3>You have the one being at ucla,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

733
00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:21.030
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the most respected minds in</v>

734
00:38:21.031 --> 00:38:23.490
<v Speaker 3>anti-doping phd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chemist,</v>

735
00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:28.920
<v Speaker 3>I'm his answer in terms of readminister</v>
<v Speaker 3>ration.</v>

736
00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:30.390
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was this.</v>

737
00:38:30.391 --> 00:38:35.080
<v Speaker 3>And you very rarely see scientists at</v>
<v Speaker 3>his level talk in a absolute in</v>

738
00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:36.190
<v Speaker 3>absolutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There you go.</v>

739
00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:41.110
<v Speaker 2>And here he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is no evidence that dah cmt has</v>

740
00:38:41.111 --> 00:38:43.690
<v Speaker 2>been readministered that's in writing to</v>
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>

741
00:38:43.691 --> 00:38:46.550
<v Speaker 2>So very definitive on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

742
00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:50.530
<v Speaker 2>you sought as science director.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now danny daniels independent even of</v>

743
00:38:50.531 --> 00:38:52.060
<v Speaker 2>usada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So those who criticize,</v>

744
00:38:52.061 --> 00:38:54.280
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you saw it as in bed with the ufc.</v>

745
00:38:54.610 --> 00:38:58.390
<v Speaker 2>Daniel lackner doesn't work for usada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He runs an independent laboratory.</v>

746
00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:01.960
<v Speaker 2>Usada send samples there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The nfl send samples,</v>

747
00:39:01.961 --> 00:39:04.440
<v Speaker 2>they're major league baseball,</v>
<v Speaker 2>send samples there.</v>

748
00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:06.670
<v Speaker 2>The ncaa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's independent,</v>

749
00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.550
<v Speaker 2>owns his own laboratory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

750
00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:14.050
<v Speaker 2>usada also put out a letter to us in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in writing,</v>

751
00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:17.050
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>upon careful consideration of the very</v>

752
00:39:17.051 --> 00:39:22.051
<v Speaker 2>low concentration of the dh cmt longterm</v>
<v Speaker 2>metabolite and Mr. Jones is sample and</v>

753
00:39:22.181 --> 00:39:25.750
<v Speaker 2>taking into account the human pharma</v>
<v Speaker 2>kinetic characteristics of this</v>

754
00:39:25.751 --> 00:39:28.170
<v Speaker 2>particular longterm anabolic steroid</v>
<v Speaker 2>metabolites,</v>

755
00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:30.760
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>based on data to which you saw it has</v>

756
00:39:30.761 --> 00:39:34.540
<v Speaker 2>access to and in consult,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in consultation with scientific experts,</v>

757
00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:38.950
<v Speaker 2>some of whose opinions are enclosed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you sought as concluded consistent with</v>

758
00:39:38.951 --> 00:39:40.630
<v Speaker 2>prior residual amounts detected.</v>

759
00:39:40.630 --> 00:39:45.630
<v Speaker 2>And Mr. Jones sample that the presence</v>
<v Speaker 2>of dh cmt longterm metabolite is</v>

760
00:39:45.761 --> 00:39:50.761
<v Speaker 2>consistent with residual amounts from</v>
<v Speaker 2>exposure prior to July 28th,</v>

761
00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:54.070
<v Speaker 2>2017.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

762
00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:54.980
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

763
00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:57.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm not an expert.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't profess to be,</v>

764
00:39:57.610 --> 00:39:59.950
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my background's in finance and</v>

765
00:39:59.951 --> 00:40:02.200
<v Speaker 2>accounting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I traced the money back in the old days,</v>

766
00:40:02.201 --> 00:40:06.940
<v Speaker 2>but I know who those experts are out</v>
<v Speaker 2>there in the world and these are them.</v>

767
00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:09.670
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're my putting these things in</v>

768
00:40:09.671 --> 00:40:11.860
<v Speaker 2>writing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>putting their reputations on the line</v>

769
00:40:11.861 --> 00:40:14.470
<v Speaker 2>now and forever going forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

770
00:40:14.471 --> 00:40:17.140
<v Speaker 2>they're never going to do something like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that because you know,</v>

771
00:40:17.141 --> 00:40:22.141
<v Speaker 2>the ufc pays you saw to administer our</v>
<v Speaker 2>program or because jon jones is a</v>

772
00:40:22.181 --> 00:40:24.760
<v Speaker 2>popular fighter and they want to see him</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight this weekend.</v>

773
00:40:24.761 --> 00:40:27.460
<v Speaker 2>That's just not the way this world</v>
<v Speaker 2>works.</v>

774
00:40:27.490 --> 00:40:29.650
<v Speaker 2>Of course in in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it works the opposite way.</v>

775
00:40:29.651 --> 00:40:31.870
<v Speaker 2>There would be a great benefit if they</v>
<v Speaker 2>could catch him cheating.</v>

776
00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:32.823
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

777
00:40:32.890 --> 00:40:36.640
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>historically experts like this are very,</v>

778
00:40:36.641 --> 00:40:40.360
<v Speaker 2>very conservative when it comes to</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking in absolutes like this.</v>

779
00:40:40.361 --> 00:40:43.090
<v Speaker 2>They don't normally do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In all fairness.</v>

780
00:40:43.091 --> 00:40:48.091
<v Speaker 2>The real question is guys like you and</v>
<v Speaker 2>me because we are ufc employees so we</v>

781
00:40:48.131 --> 00:40:50.470
<v Speaker 2>can handle this fairly and get that</v>
<v Speaker 2>argument,</v>

782
00:40:50.690 --> 00:40:53.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I saw that left and right that hey,</v>

783
00:40:53.321 --> 00:40:56.390
<v Speaker 2>jeff and joe are paid by the ufc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course they're going to come out in</v>

784
00:40:56.391 --> 00:40:57.430
<v Speaker 2>this way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but look,</v>

785
00:40:57.520 --> 00:41:00.640
<v Speaker 2>all these things that I'm reciting today</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever do that in regards to cheating,</v>

786
00:41:01.090 --> 00:41:02.140
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

787
00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:05.540
<v Speaker 2>I side with the ufc and a lot of things</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I support the sport and I want</v>

788
00:41:05.541 --> 00:41:09.220
<v Speaker 2>it to excel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't side ever with cheating.</v>

789
00:41:09.310 --> 00:41:14.310
<v Speaker 2>If I think that there's some way somehow</v>
<v Speaker 2>that someone is given an unfair</v>

790
00:41:14.531 --> 00:41:16.810
<v Speaker 2>advantage and this is somehow being</v>
<v Speaker 2>covered up,</v>

791
00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:18.460
<v Speaker 2>I would rather not work for them.</v>

792
00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:19.060
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

793
00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:22.390
<v Speaker 2>my seventh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my last 17 years of my career,</v>

794
00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:23.500
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

795
00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:24.400
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

796
00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:28.090
<v Speaker 2>everything that I've worked for is to</v>
<v Speaker 2>protect the rights of clean athletes and</v>

797
00:41:28.091 --> 00:41:32.410
<v Speaker 2>to eradicate cheating from the sport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't tell you how strongly I feel</v>

798
00:41:32.411 --> 00:41:34.940
<v Speaker 2>about that given me everything in my</v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

799
00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:37.220
<v Speaker 2>My dad was a high school basketball</v>
<v Speaker 2>coach,</v>

800
00:41:37.530 --> 00:41:40.730
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it paid for my college and scholarships.</v>

801
00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:41.601
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

802
00:41:41.601 --> 00:41:46.130
<v Speaker 2>at least the good characteristics in me</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can all trace directly to sports and</v>

803
00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:49.310
<v Speaker 2>entering into the equation the issues of</v>
<v Speaker 2>breaking the rules,</v>

804
00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:52.340
<v Speaker 2>the issues of the health and safety</v>
<v Speaker 2>aspects when you have young.</v>

805
00:41:52.341 --> 00:41:56.990
<v Speaker 2>And I talked to many parents whose kids</v>
<v Speaker 2>use steroids because they saw the</v>

806
00:41:56.991 --> 00:42:00.860
<v Speaker 2>professional athletes doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Entering that into the body when your</v>

807
00:42:00.861 --> 00:42:03.410
<v Speaker 2>hormonal levels are already out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>control is very,</v>

808
00:42:03.411 --> 00:42:05.570
<v Speaker 2>very dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both short and longterm.</v>

809
00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:09.320
<v Speaker 2>Can't tell you how passionate I am about</v>
<v Speaker 2>this issue.</v>

810
00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:14.120
<v Speaker 2>And those out there that are saying that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm corrupt and my reputation is out the</v>

811
00:42:14.121 --> 00:42:17.230
<v Speaker 2>window,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would never ever in a million years</v>

812
00:42:17.231 --> 00:42:20.300
<v Speaker 2>listening to those people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you obviously you have,</v>

813
00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:25.360
<v Speaker 2>but you can't listen to those people</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they want to find things wrong.</v>

814
00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:28.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that I've said about</v>

815
00:42:28.821 --> 00:42:30.920
<v Speaker 2>you is you're a guy who loves to catch</v>
<v Speaker 2>people cheating.</v>

816
00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:32.630
<v Speaker 2>You like it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you enjoy it.</v>

817
00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:33.920
<v Speaker 2>That's not true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

818
00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:36.530
<v Speaker 2>You do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't mind if someone is cheating and</v>

819
00:42:36.531 --> 00:42:37.580
<v Speaker 2>you catch them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

820
00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:40.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the ufc program now with what we've</v>

821
00:42:40.611 --> 00:42:42.860
<v Speaker 2>established here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

822
00:42:42.861 --> 00:42:44.810
<v Speaker 2>Back in the old days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we've talked about this.</v>

823
00:42:44.811 --> 00:42:47.660
<v Speaker 2>Look when you had in baseball or in</v>
<v Speaker 2>cycling,</v>

824
00:42:48.410 --> 00:42:51.470
<v Speaker 2>no testing going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Literally the Organizations were looking</v>

825
00:42:51.471 --> 00:42:53.390
<v Speaker 2>in the other direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've often said that,</v>

826
00:42:53.391 --> 00:42:54.980
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't agree with what they did,</v>

827
00:42:54.981 --> 00:42:58.820
<v Speaker 2>but there's a portion of me and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>why I think a lot of these athletes</v>

828
00:42:58.821 --> 00:43:00.730
<v Speaker 2>respected me and share that information.</v>

829
00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:04.190
<v Speaker 2>There's a portion of me that said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't agree with what you did.</v>

830
00:43:04.191 --> 00:43:06.080
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to think I wouldn't make the</v>
<v Speaker 2>sand decision,</v>

831
00:43:06.081 --> 00:43:08.240
<v Speaker 2>but I damn well understand why you did</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

832
00:43:08.570 --> 00:43:10.940
<v Speaker 2>You're fighting for millions of dollars</v>
<v Speaker 2>in contracts,</v>

833
00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:12.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your teammates are doing it,</v>

834
00:43:13.130 --> 00:43:15.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your competitors are doing it and you</v>

835
00:43:15.531 --> 00:43:17.540
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're professional sports organization</v>

836
00:43:17.541 --> 00:43:21.290
<v Speaker 2>doesn't give a shit because of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>weakness of the testing program or total</v>

837
00:43:21.291 --> 00:43:22.124
<v Speaker 2>lack there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

838
00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:24.170
<v Speaker 2>So in instances like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was,</v>

839
00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:27.510
<v Speaker 2>I never came away saying that guy's an</v>
<v Speaker 2>idiot or an asshole for choose.</v>

840
00:43:27.511 --> 00:43:30.380
<v Speaker 2>And I came away saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kinda get why he did it.</v>

841
00:43:30.381 --> 00:43:32.750
<v Speaker 2>If I was 21 or 22 years old and</v>
<v Speaker 2>immature,</v>

842
00:43:32.751 --> 00:43:37.430
<v Speaker 2>I may have made the same decision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now come into our program here where you</v>

843
00:43:37.431 --> 00:43:39.830
<v Speaker 2>have an organization that cares very</v>
<v Speaker 2>much,</v>

844
00:43:39.831 --> 00:43:44.831
<v Speaker 2>that spends multimillion dollars a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This program has done nothing but costs.</v>

845
00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:49.840
<v Speaker 2>The ufc money costs us money and how we</v>
<v Speaker 2>implement the program costs us money on</v>

846
00:43:50.241 --> 00:43:53.870
<v Speaker 2>canceling fights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anybody who thinks moving this fight to</v>

847
00:43:53.871 --> 00:43:57.860
<v Speaker 2>California is that a financial benefit</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the ufc is crazy.</v>

848
00:43:57.861 --> 00:44:01.580
<v Speaker 2>We're taking a bath on this one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People really do need to understand that</v>

849
00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:06.590
<v Speaker 2>the ufc decided themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They self imposed usada as say,</v>

850
00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:08.240
<v Speaker 2>sanctioning of fights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

851
00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:10.070
<v Speaker 2>Nobody forced us to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is a.</v>

852
00:44:10.071 --> 00:44:14.840
<v Speaker 2>This was a big step in the right</v>
<v Speaker 2>direction of trying to make the sport</v>

853
00:44:14.841 --> 00:44:17.570
<v Speaker 2>cleaner because we recognize that first</v>
<v Speaker 2>of all,</v>

854
00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:20.800
<v Speaker 2>there was some legal stuff with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>testosterone replacement therapy that</v>

855
00:44:20.801 --> 00:44:22.970
<v Speaker 2>just threw everything out of whack right</v>
<v Speaker 2>where it was.</v>

856
00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:26.600
<v Speaker 2>Essentially it was sanctioned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cheating.</v>

857
00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:28.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's be honest about what that was.</v>

858
00:44:28.670 --> 00:44:30.440
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was clearly a my understanding being</v>

859
00:44:30.441 --> 00:44:31.850
<v Speaker 2>manipulated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

860
00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:35.310
<v Speaker 2>very easy to manipulate when you get</v>
<v Speaker 2>permission to use any prohibited</v>

861
00:44:35.311 --> 00:44:36.150
<v Speaker 2>substance like that.</v>

862
00:44:36.330 --> 00:44:41.330
<v Speaker 2>And we went from that to unbelievably</v>
<v Speaker 2>strict protocols and now what you're</v>

863
00:44:42.061 --> 00:44:44.520
<v Speaker 2>seeing is you're seeing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

864
00:44:44.790 --> 00:44:49.380
<v Speaker 2>we saw a radical change in the physiques</v>
<v Speaker 2>have some fighters where we did have</v>

865
00:44:49.381 --> 00:44:53.100
<v Speaker 2>some suspicions and those suspicions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least in my eyes had been confirmed</v>

866
00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:58.640
<v Speaker 2>and now we're seeing the good side of</v>
<v Speaker 2>this with what in your estimation might</v>

867
00:45:01.711 --> 00:45:05.400
<v Speaker 2>have been moved over into a position</v>
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>

868
00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:07.890
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now now it's getting a little bit</v>

869
00:45:07.891 --> 00:45:12.510
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous in terms of like what we can</v>
<v Speaker 2>detect and what is what is causing</v>

870
00:45:12.511 --> 00:45:14.610
<v Speaker 2>fights to be cancelled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

871
00:45:14.611 --> 00:45:18.500
<v Speaker 2>So interestingly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world antidoping agency or water,</v>

872
00:45:18.501 --> 00:45:23.100
<v Speaker 2>they're next code revision is 2021.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they regularly put out,</v>

873
00:45:23.101 --> 00:45:25.320
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are the issues going forward that</v>

874
00:45:25.321 --> 00:45:28.320
<v Speaker 2>we want to address?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the major issues is</v>

875
00:45:28.321 --> 00:45:33.321
<v Speaker 2>potentially establishing thresholds for</v>
<v Speaker 2>these low level substances that keep</v>

876
00:45:34.651 --> 00:45:35.484
<v Speaker 2>appearing.</v>

877
00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:38.340
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dah cmt being one of them,</v>

878
00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:42.980
<v Speaker 2>austrian being one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the idea that water is looking at</v>

879
00:45:42.990 --> 00:45:46.020
<v Speaker 2>and has a working group of worldwide</v>
<v Speaker 2>experts is,</v>

880
00:45:46.021 --> 00:45:48.000
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if if something that gets reported back</v>

881
00:45:48.001 --> 00:45:52.290
<v Speaker 2>at under 50 pika grams,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the evidence is showing,</v>

882
00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:55.320
<v Speaker 2>more likely than not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is from a very low level</v>

883
00:45:55.321 --> 00:45:58.790
<v Speaker 2>contaminant issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've never seen an issue of microdosing</v>

884
00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:00.960
<v Speaker 2>or an intentional use that's reached</v>
<v Speaker 2>that level.</v>

885
00:46:01.290 --> 00:46:06.290
<v Speaker 2>Why are the labs even reporting at sub</v>
<v Speaker 2>at quantities lower than 50 pika grams</v>

886
00:46:07.351 --> 00:46:09.750
<v Speaker 2>or 100 peak grams?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think very soon they're going to come</v>

887
00:46:09.751 --> 00:46:14.580
<v Speaker 2>out with a recommendation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are going to adopt that before 2021.</v>

888
00:46:14.581 --> 00:46:17.790
<v Speaker 2>Once that working group and we're in</v>
<v Speaker 2>communication with them,</v>

889
00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:21.540
<v Speaker 2>comes up with those recommendations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll see it implemented first in the</v>

890
00:46:21.541 --> 00:46:22.890
<v Speaker 2>ufc program.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

891
00:46:23.130 --> 00:46:28.130
<v Speaker 2>I've always said fairness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>due process in a program is just as</v>

892
00:46:28.531 --> 00:46:30.390
<v Speaker 2>important as the strength and</v>
<v Speaker 2>comprehension,</v>

893
00:46:30.590 --> 00:46:32.310
<v Speaker 2>comprehensiveness of that program.</v>

894
00:46:32.310 --> 00:46:36.570
<v Speaker 2>You'll lose faith in your athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could have the strongest loophole</v>

895
00:46:36.571 --> 00:46:40.440
<v Speaker 2>free program in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you start implement ting things</v>

896
00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:43.770
<v Speaker 2>unfairly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll lose faith just as much as if you</v>

897
00:46:43.771 --> 00:46:45.300
<v Speaker 2>had a bunch of loopholes and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>program.</v>

898
00:46:45.301 --> 00:46:49.450
<v Speaker 2>It's got to be fair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you aware of the female skier that</v>

899
00:46:49.590 --> 00:46:52.110
<v Speaker 2>tested positive because of lip balm?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

900
00:46:52.111 --> 00:46:53.040
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

901
00:46:53.041 --> 00:46:56.310
<v Speaker 2>it's vaguely recall about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was someone else use the lip balm</v>

902
00:46:56.311 --> 00:46:57.510
<v Speaker 2>before her?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

903
00:46:57.540 --> 00:46:58.081
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

904
00:46:58.081 --> 00:46:59.040
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a,</v>

905
00:46:59.090 --> 00:47:00.990
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lip balm for sunburn.</v>

906
00:47:01.620 --> 00:47:06.620
<v Speaker 2>It was for sunburnt lips and it had some</v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculously small trace amount.</v>

907
00:47:07.410 --> 00:47:12.030
<v Speaker 2>Was it austrian cve?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Her name is jo jo burg.</v>

908
00:47:14.530 --> 00:47:15.660
<v Speaker 2>Trying to remember her name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

909
00:47:15.690 --> 00:47:18.510
<v Speaker 2>there was the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cocaine kissing defense was actually</v>

910
00:47:18.511 --> 00:47:20.640
<v Speaker 2>won an arbitration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So something similar.</v>

911
00:47:20.641 --> 00:47:23.820
<v Speaker 2>Somebody tested positive for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

912
00:47:23.821 --> 00:47:26.760
<v Speaker 2>low level metabolites of cocaine and</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically said,</v>

913
00:47:26.761 --> 00:47:27.301
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

914
00:47:27.301 --> 00:47:28.590
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether that was good or not,</v>

915
00:47:28.591 --> 00:47:30.300
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

916
00:47:30.310 --> 00:47:32.070
<v Speaker 2>the arbitrator bought it and the science</v>
<v Speaker 2>shows,</v>

917
00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:32.490
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

918
00:47:32.490 --> 00:47:35.380
<v Speaker 2>that is a possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The detection levels are so low.</v>

919
00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:39.220
<v Speaker 2>If you kiss somebody who had just done</v>
<v Speaker 2>cocaine,</v>

920
00:47:39.221 --> 00:47:41.440
<v Speaker 2>they are now able to detect at those</v>
<v Speaker 2>levels,</v>

921
00:47:41.441 --> 00:47:45.130
<v Speaker 2>in the person that kiss that person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>

922
00:47:45.220 --> 00:47:49.000
<v Speaker 2>Do you find this woman doping label on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the label?</v>

923
00:47:49.090 --> 00:47:51.030
<v Speaker 2>Which is why they gave her a penalty</v>
<v Speaker 2>apparently.</v>

924
00:47:51.060 --> 00:47:51.893
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>

925
00:47:51.970 --> 00:47:53.620
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is the,</v>

926
00:47:53.621 --> 00:47:56.200
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who fucks reading labels on lip balms?</v>

927
00:47:56.830 --> 00:47:57.940
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

928
00:47:58.300 --> 00:48:00.220
<v Speaker 2>that's how crazy it's gotten.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

929
00:48:00.221 --> 00:48:03.610
<v Speaker 2>all our athletes know when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they're using a creatine or a</v>

930
00:48:03.611 --> 00:48:06.220
<v Speaker 2>protein or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think most of them are pretty careful</v>

931
00:48:06.221 --> 00:48:08.110
<v Speaker 2>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to tell them,</v>

932
00:48:08.111 --> 00:48:10.060
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to read your lip balm and your</v>

933
00:48:10.210 --> 00:48:11.170
<v Speaker 2>deodorant.</v>

934
00:48:11.170 --> 00:48:11.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>

935
00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:15.760
<v Speaker 2>what level of we get into here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And these levels of detection.</v>

936
00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:20.590
<v Speaker 2>So she 29 year old star of norway's</v>
<v Speaker 2>powerhouse squad of skiing,</v>

937
00:48:20.591 --> 00:48:23.650
<v Speaker 2>cross country skiing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tested positive for an anabolic agent</v>

938
00:48:23.651 --> 00:48:26.080
<v Speaker 2>listed in the contents of a treatment</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sunburn.</v>

939
00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:31.510
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this could be similar in some ways to</v>

940
00:48:31.511 --> 00:48:34.900
<v Speaker 2>what Chad mendez tested positive for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for something for psoriasis,</v>

941
00:48:34.901 --> 00:48:37.810
<v Speaker 2>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sat Chad mendez has obvious psoriasis.</v>

942
00:48:37.811 --> 00:48:40.780
<v Speaker 2>You'd see it on his body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's talked about it pretty openly and</v>

943
00:48:40.781 --> 00:48:44.200
<v Speaker 2>you use some sort of a cream and</v>
<v Speaker 2>accepted his penalty.</v>

944
00:48:44.201 --> 00:48:46.180
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't aware that this cream had</v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

945
00:48:46.181 --> 00:48:48.400
<v Speaker 2>some type of a steroid into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

946
00:48:48.401 --> 00:48:52.690
<v Speaker 2>I had seen him publicly state that now</v>
<v Speaker 2>he chose not to present a defense or go</v>

947
00:48:52.691 --> 00:48:55.690
<v Speaker 2>to arbitration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I haven't seen anything in detail to</v>

948
00:48:55.691 --> 00:48:58.030
<v Speaker 2>review.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just wrote knowledgeable opinion on</v>

949
00:48:58.031 --> 00:48:58.421
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

950
00:48:58.421 --> 00:48:59.300
<v Speaker 2>he did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

951
00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:00.120
<v Speaker 2>what.</v>

952
00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:04.030
<v Speaker 2>So let's get back to the frank mir case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Frank mir tested positive.</v>

953
00:49:04.150 --> 00:49:07.820
<v Speaker 2>Was it also also same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>longterm metabolite of world to</v>

954
00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:09.460
<v Speaker 2>rentable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the difference.</v>

955
00:49:09.700 --> 00:49:14.700
<v Speaker 2>Frank mir the same as John Jones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His first time through was sanctioned.</v>

956
00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:19.150
<v Speaker 2>John didn't get off the first time they</v>
<v Speaker 2>showed up in his system.</v>

957
00:49:19.151 --> 00:49:19.931
<v Speaker 2>He got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

958
00:49:19.931 --> 00:49:23.020
<v Speaker 2>he was looking at potential for years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>went to arbitration,</v>

959
00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:27.340
<v Speaker 2>presented evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>enacted some other clauses in the policy</v>

960
00:49:27.341 --> 00:49:29.950
<v Speaker 2>that reduced his sanction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>

961
00:49:30.580 --> 00:49:33.880
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of them was a substantial assistance</v>

962
00:49:34.390 --> 00:49:37.810
<v Speaker 2>where he assisted usada in some way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shape or form,</v>

963
00:49:37.811 --> 00:49:39.820
<v Speaker 2>and he got a reduction for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for doing that.</v>

964
00:49:39.821 --> 00:49:42.160
<v Speaker 2>Assisted in what way?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know,</v>

965
00:49:42.161 --> 00:49:44.830
<v Speaker 2>and this is the exact reason why I do</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

966
00:49:44.831 --> 00:49:49.690
<v Speaker 2>So I insulate myself from that</v>
<v Speaker 2>interaction between usada and the</v>

967
00:49:49.691 --> 00:49:50.960
<v Speaker 2>athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are the sole,</v>

968
00:49:50.961 --> 00:49:52.570
<v Speaker 2>a dirty jew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>decatur in this.</v>

969
00:49:53.020 --> 00:49:54.820
<v Speaker 2>They do not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

970
00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:56.200
<v Speaker 2>get me on the phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

971
00:49:56.201 --> 00:49:57.610
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're thinking about going this way.</v>

972
00:49:57.611 --> 00:50:00.170
<v Speaker 2>They adjudicate completely in a vacuum</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you are,</v>

973
00:50:00.171 --> 00:50:04.660
<v Speaker 2>you're just so people know your title is</v>
<v Speaker 2>safety,</v>

974
00:50:04.661 --> 00:50:06.700
<v Speaker 2>health and safety,</v>
<v Speaker 2>athlete health and performance.</v>

975
00:50:06.701 --> 00:50:08.590
<v Speaker 2>Vice president of athlete health and</v>
<v Speaker 2>performance.</v>

976
00:50:08.591 --> 00:50:11.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you no longer work for you saw?</v>

977
00:50:11.321 --> 00:50:12.710
<v Speaker 2>I've never worked for usada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

978
00:50:12.740 --> 00:50:15.070
<v Speaker 2>that's a big misconception.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of our fighters think that I've</v>

979
00:50:15.071 --> 00:50:18.580
<v Speaker 2>never worked for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a federal agent for 22 and a half</v>

980
00:50:18.581 --> 00:50:21.850
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the latter part of my career and got</v>

981
00:50:21.851 --> 00:50:25.360
<v Speaker 2>involved with all these ped distribution</v>
<v Speaker 2>cases.</v>

982
00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:30.840
<v Speaker 2>Two thousand 15 fertitta and dana white</v>
<v Speaker 2>through a mutual friend contacted me and</v>

983
00:50:31.371 --> 00:50:31.611
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

984
00:50:31.611 --> 00:50:33.710
<v Speaker 2>would you come out and kind of talk to</v>
<v Speaker 2>us?</v>

985
00:50:33.711 --> 00:50:36.350
<v Speaker 2>We're contemplating maybe putting our</v>
<v Speaker 2>own program together.</v>

986
00:50:36.351 --> 00:50:39.050
<v Speaker 2>We've had some recent high profile</v>
<v Speaker 2>positive,</v>

987
00:50:39.051 --> 00:50:43.550
<v Speaker 2>so I came out to vegas a talk with them</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a week later I get a phone call</v>

988
00:50:43.551 --> 00:50:47.000
<v Speaker 2>asking if I want to come work for him</v>
<v Speaker 2>and kind of implement this new program,</v>

989
00:50:47.001 --> 00:50:49.730
<v Speaker 2>but I've never been an employee of</v>
<v Speaker 2>usada.</v>

990
00:50:49.790 --> 00:50:50.623
<v Speaker 2>OkAy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's.</v>

991
00:50:50.670 --> 00:50:54.200
<v Speaker 2>That's good to know because that's been</v>
<v Speaker 2>stated by some public figures that you</v>

992
00:50:54.201 --> 00:50:56.990
<v Speaker 2>used to work for usada and now you work</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the ufc.</v>

993
00:50:57.880 --> 00:51:01.460
<v Speaker 2>Shale was one of my favorite words.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

994
00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:04.820
<v Speaker 2>so you never worked for usada you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

995
00:51:04.850 --> 00:51:09.740
<v Speaker 2>brought usada to the ufc or communicated</v>
<v Speaker 2>with usada and facilitated this</v>

996
00:51:09.741 --> 00:51:11.210
<v Speaker 2>agreement?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

997
00:51:11.211 --> 00:51:13.330
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd never worked for you sada.</v>

998
00:51:13.370 --> 00:51:17.450
<v Speaker 2>I did work very closely with usada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you saw that when I first started</v>

999
00:51:17.510 --> 00:51:20.200
<v Speaker 2>these series of investigations back in</v>
<v Speaker 2>2002.</v>

1000
00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:23.210
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew all about how to work a heroin</v>

1001
00:51:23.211 --> 00:51:26.300
<v Speaker 2>distribution organization and cocaine</v>
<v Speaker 2>distribution organization,</v>

1002
00:51:26.301 --> 00:51:29.180
<v Speaker 2>methamphetamine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when it came to performance</v>

1003
00:51:29.181 --> 00:51:32.600
<v Speaker 2>enhancing drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was no class that myself or really</v>

1004
00:51:32.601 --> 00:51:35.960
<v Speaker 2>any other federal agent or law</v>
<v Speaker 2>enforcement agent goes through</v>

1005
00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:39.110
<v Speaker 2>surrounding distribution of performance</v>
<v Speaker 2>enhancing drugs.</v>

1006
00:51:39.111 --> 00:51:44.111
<v Speaker 2>So I was examining the discarded garbage</v>
<v Speaker 2>of balco every week when they put it out</v>

1007
00:51:44.901 --> 00:51:47.840
<v Speaker 2>to the curb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>began seeing notes,</v>

1008
00:51:47.870 --> 00:51:49.490
<v Speaker 2>rappers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these substances.</v>

1009
00:51:49.490 --> 00:51:52.970
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea what these things were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know the difference between</v>

1010
00:51:52.971 --> 00:51:55.310
<v Speaker 2>testosterone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>epitestosterone,</v>

1011
00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:57.230
<v Speaker 2>erythropoietin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hgh.</v>

1012
00:51:57.231 --> 00:52:00.950
<v Speaker 2>I knew nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what I did is I figured out who those</v>

1013
00:52:00.951 --> 00:52:03.650
<v Speaker 2>experts were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who were the people that could very</v>

1014
00:52:03.651 --> 00:52:06.080
<v Speaker 2>quickly get me up to speed on what I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at.</v>

1015
00:52:06.430 --> 00:52:07.940
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dr catlin,</v>

1016
00:52:07.970 --> 00:52:11.450
<v Speaker 2>who ran the ucl olympic loud one of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>first and he started,</v>

1017
00:52:11.890 --> 00:52:12.561
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1018
00:52:12.561 --> 00:52:16.100
<v Speaker 2>kind of walking me through this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he put me in touch with usada and you</v>

1019
00:52:16.101 --> 00:52:18.110
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they began educating me as well.</v>

1020
00:52:18.111 --> 00:52:19.430
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1021
00:52:19.460 --> 00:52:22.580
<v Speaker 2>over the course of those investigations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1022
00:52:22.581 --> 00:52:25.850
<v Speaker 2>I got a lot from them in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 2>educating on these substances.</v>

1023
00:52:25.851 --> 00:52:29.510
<v Speaker 2>They were bringing some of their</v>
<v Speaker 2>cooperating witnesses to me and then we</v>

1024
00:52:29.630 --> 00:52:33.470
<v Speaker 2>go off and running on criminal</v>
<v Speaker 2>investigations but never,</v>

1025
00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:36.860
<v Speaker 2>never worked for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you sought to correct me if I'm</v>

1026
00:52:36.861 --> 00:52:39.350
<v Speaker 2>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the way they would work would be</v>

1027
00:52:39.351 --> 00:52:40.810
<v Speaker 2>very compartmentalized.</v>

1028
00:52:40.810 --> 00:52:44.750
<v Speaker 2>Like they would not specifically</v>
<v Speaker 2>communicate with you on all of the</v>

1029
00:52:44.751 --> 00:52:46.310
<v Speaker 2>details of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

1030
00:52:46.311 --> 00:52:49.640
<v Speaker 2>And they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now pendants aspect,</v>

1031
00:52:49.641 --> 00:52:52.460
<v Speaker 2>I don't as these deliberations are going</v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

1032
00:52:52.910 --> 00:52:54.800
<v Speaker 2>what they're looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1033
00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:59.180
<v Speaker 2>It's cooperation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just for me to be frank would in my</v>

1034
00:52:59.181 --> 00:53:01.610
<v Speaker 2>eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would mean that something was done</v>

1035
00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:06.170
<v Speaker 2>purposely illegally and this person had</v>
<v Speaker 2>some knowledge of purpose,</v>

1036
00:53:06.380 --> 00:53:08.630
<v Speaker 2>purposeful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>illegal aCtivity,</v>

1037
00:53:08.810 --> 00:53:13.810
<v Speaker 2>and that they would somehow communicate</v>
<v Speaker 2>this to facilitate some sort of catching</v>

1038
00:53:15.020 --> 00:53:17.900
<v Speaker 2>of someone involved in a criminal act or</v>
<v Speaker 2>an act of cheating.</v>

1039
00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:19.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would make sense to me too.</v>

1040
00:53:19.530 --> 00:53:21.770
<v Speaker 2>He said that would be what we were</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about.</v>

1041
00:53:21.810 --> 00:53:26.810
<v Speaker 2>Usada would allow john a shorter if he</v>
<v Speaker 2>actively participated in helping them</v>

1042
00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:31.050
<v Speaker 2>catch people that were cheating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that's the understanding.</v>

1043
00:53:31.051 --> 00:53:33.080
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Implied implied.</v>

1044
00:53:33.090 --> 00:53:34.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't know to what level that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>

1045
00:53:34.831 --> 00:53:37.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it was that or if it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

1046
00:53:37.201 --> 00:53:39.750
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's how this drug works.</v>

1047
00:53:39.930 --> 00:53:41.040
<v Speaker 2>In more general.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's.</v>

1048
00:53:41.100 --> 00:53:44.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I purposely that would mean that john</v>

1049
00:53:44.671 --> 00:53:47.610
<v Speaker 2>would have to know about cheating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you were saying like this,</v>

1050
00:53:47.611 --> 00:53:50.100
<v Speaker 2>this is how this drug works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is how I used it.</v>

1051
00:53:50.430 --> 00:53:53.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean this would he would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would mean his initial defense</v>

1052
00:53:53.821 --> 00:53:55.770
<v Speaker 2>would have to be thrown out the window</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it wasn't an accident.</v>

1053
00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:56.521
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1054
00:53:56.521 --> 00:53:59.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you knew something separate from,</v>

1055
00:53:59.590 --> 00:54:01.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he wasn't someone else.</v>

1056
00:54:01.651 --> 00:54:02.401
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

1057
00:54:02.401 --> 00:54:04.380
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want anybody to reach that</v>

1058
00:54:04.381 --> 00:54:07.710
<v Speaker 2>conclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea what his substantial</v>

1059
00:54:07.711 --> 00:54:09.480
<v Speaker 2>assistance entailed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None.</v>

1060
00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:11.520
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's a slippery slope.</v>

1061
00:54:11.580 --> 00:54:15.960
<v Speaker 2>It is a slippery slope and look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>transparency's important in any program,</v>

1062
00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:18.990
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>only to a certain level.</v>

1063
00:54:18.991 --> 00:54:21.030
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you are transparent about what</v>

1064
00:54:21.090 --> 00:54:22.420
<v Speaker 2>everyone's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1065
00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:26.610
<v Speaker 2>cooperation or substantial assistant was</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the whole world knew about it,</v>

1066
00:54:26.820 --> 00:54:29.740
<v Speaker 2>you're never going to get anybody after</v>
<v Speaker 2>that coming in and,</v>

1067
00:54:29.810 --> 00:54:30.990
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and cooperating.</v>

1068
00:54:30.990 --> 00:54:34.890
<v Speaker 2>I saw this definitely on the criminal</v>
<v Speaker 2>side with informants.</v>

1069
00:54:34.891 --> 00:54:37.410
<v Speaker 2>You don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not something that's that you</v>

1070
00:54:37.411 --> 00:54:39.390
<v Speaker 2>want to be transparent about or</v>
<v Speaker 2>disclose.</v>

1071
00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:41.580
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's going to be a bunch of</v>

1072
00:54:41.581 --> 00:54:44.640
<v Speaker 2>people that have a real issue with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea that jon jones,</v>

1073
00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:47.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the greatest fighters of all time</v>

1074
00:54:47.181 --> 00:54:49.690
<v Speaker 2>is actually working as an informant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

1075
00:54:49.691 --> 00:54:51.090
<v Speaker 2>it's listed in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>

1076
00:54:51.210 --> 00:54:53.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the mclaren's ruling that that was</v>

1077
00:54:53.071 --> 00:54:56.520
<v Speaker 2>one of the reasons for the mitigating</v>
<v Speaker 2>factor in the reduction.</v>

1078
00:54:56.521 --> 00:54:57.480
<v Speaker 2>But I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1079
00:54:57.680 --> 00:55:00.870
<v Speaker 2>joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know to leave that alone.</v>

1080
00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:02.400
<v Speaker 2>Nothing about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been stated.</v>

1081
00:55:02.401 --> 00:55:03.390
<v Speaker 2>We know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1082
00:55:03.540 --> 00:55:05.710
<v Speaker 2>Or what we know that it's a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1083
00:55:05.820 --> 00:55:10.820
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to the john's initial test</v>
<v Speaker 2>where he was sanctioned and was</v>

1084
00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:16.200
<v Speaker 2>suspended for a determined period of</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1085
00:55:16.500 --> 00:55:21.210
<v Speaker 2>Frank mir also was sanctioned and was</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a determined period of time as well.</v>

1086
00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:22.490
<v Speaker 2>He was two years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was.</v>

1087
00:55:22.900 --> 00:55:25.950
<v Speaker 2>John was shorter than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>John was shorter and cooperate on a</v>

1088
00:55:25.951 --> 00:55:27.450
<v Speaker 2>bunch of other to fail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you,</v>

1089
00:55:27.451 --> 00:55:28.710
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you not only cooperative,</v>

1090
00:55:28.711 --> 00:55:30.870
<v Speaker 2>he went to arbitration and put on a</v>
<v Speaker 2>defense.</v>

1091
00:55:30.871 --> 00:55:32.400
<v Speaker 2>He put on a defense that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1092
00:55:32.910 --> 00:55:35.880
<v Speaker 2>the evidence here shows no intentional</v>
<v Speaker 2>ingestion of it,</v>

1093
00:55:35.881 --> 00:55:40.110
<v Speaker 2>and in fact that claire and gave him a</v>
<v Speaker 2>further reduction based on.</v>

1094
00:55:40.111 --> 00:55:42.870
<v Speaker 2>There was no evidence of this was</v>
<v Speaker 2>intentionally done.</v>

1095
00:55:43.290 --> 00:55:46.500
<v Speaker 2>Frank mir didn't put on any.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had every right to go to arbitration</v>

1096
00:55:46.860 --> 00:55:48.990
<v Speaker 2>put on his own offense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Didn't do that.</v>

1097
00:55:49.050 --> 00:55:51.660
<v Speaker 2>What about josh barnett?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Josh barnett,</v>

1098
00:55:51.661 --> 00:55:53.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a completely different set of facts.</v>

1099
00:55:53.461 --> 00:55:57.840
<v Speaker 2>His came from a contaminated supplement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a different substance.</v>

1100
00:55:58.170 --> 00:56:02.520
<v Speaker 2>He went to an arbitration hearing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The arbitrator ruled with josh and said,</v>

1101
00:56:02.521 --> 00:56:03.241
<v Speaker 2>yep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1102
00:56:03.241 --> 00:56:08.190
<v Speaker 2>based on where we are now based on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>care and effort that you took your</v>

1103
00:56:08.191 --> 00:56:11.400
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you deserve to earn to have time served</v>

1104
00:56:11.401 --> 00:56:12.810
<v Speaker 2>at the time of that arbitration.</v>

1105
00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:15.000
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a good example of the</v>

1106
00:56:15.001 --> 00:56:19.230
<v Speaker 2>checks and balances in place here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got me overseeing the program,</v>

1107
00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:21.360
<v Speaker 2>taking a look at how these things come</v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

1108
00:56:21.690 --> 00:56:26.690
<v Speaker 2>You've got the ability from the to go to</v>
<v Speaker 2>mclaren's group and judge,</v>

1109
00:56:26.980 --> 00:56:28.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the set of facts.</v>

1110
00:56:28.001 --> 00:56:30.280
<v Speaker 2>And in that case mclaren's group said</v>
<v Speaker 2>usada,</v>

1111
00:56:30.420 --> 00:56:35.420
<v Speaker 2>I think maybe overreached a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 2>here and I believe josh and josh is,</v>

1112
00:56:35.830 --> 00:56:37.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically time served.</v>

1113
00:56:37.421 --> 00:56:39.310
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd want to see,</v>

1114
00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:42.250
<v Speaker 2>you want to see them get it perfect</v>
<v Speaker 2>right every time.</v>

1115
00:56:42.251 --> 00:56:44.470
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the reality and the real world is</v>

1116
00:56:44.471 --> 00:56:47.110
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't necessarily happen and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why you have these checks and</v>

1117
00:56:47.111 --> 00:56:50.240
<v Speaker 2>balances available.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm josh barnett.</v>

1118
00:56:50.310 --> 00:56:52.720
<v Speaker 2>Take on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The matter is that they tried to paint</v>

1119
00:56:52.721 --> 00:56:55.810
<v Speaker 2>him as guilty even though he was not in</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he,</v>

1120
00:56:55.840 --> 00:57:00.840
<v Speaker 2>he feels like he definitely got a bad</v>
<v Speaker 2>deal and that he was labeled as someone</v>

1121
00:57:01.091 --> 00:57:02.830
<v Speaker 2>who is taking this substance.</v>

1122
00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:06.010
<v Speaker 2>He was suspended for a long period of</v>
<v Speaker 2>time while he was going through this and</v>

1123
00:57:06.011 --> 00:57:11.011
<v Speaker 2>although he was found not guilty that he</v>
<v Speaker 2>feels like not enough emphasis was put</v>

1124
00:57:13.091 --> 00:57:16.870
<v Speaker 2>into establishing that he was not guilty</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that he,</v>

1125
00:57:17.220 --> 00:57:20.380
<v Speaker 2>he feels like they chased him down over</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that you didn't do.</v>

1126
00:57:20.680 --> 00:57:21.251
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1127
00:57:21.251 --> 00:57:21.601
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1128
00:57:21.601 --> 00:57:25.630
<v Speaker 2>here's what he did do is he used a</v>
<v Speaker 2>supplement that if he would have</v>

1129
00:57:25.631 --> 00:57:29.380
<v Speaker 2>listened to anything that we educate on</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you saw to sends out regular</v>

1130
00:57:29.381 --> 00:57:34.381
<v Speaker 2>reminders are fighters are required on a</v>
<v Speaker 2>quarterly basis to go through videos and</v>

1131
00:57:34.541 --> 00:57:37.210
<v Speaker 2>their whereabouts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>filing that deals with these issues.</v>

1132
00:57:37.450 --> 00:57:40.660
<v Speaker 2>If he would have followed any of that</v>
<v Speaker 2>advice when it came to his supplement</v>

1133
00:57:40.661 --> 00:57:42.790
<v Speaker 2>choices,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would have never chosen the</v>

1134
00:57:42.791 --> 00:57:44.170
<v Speaker 2>supplement he used.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1135
00:57:44.490 --> 00:57:45.131
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

1136
00:57:45.131 --> 00:57:48.220
<v Speaker 2>when I heard about that supplement and</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was on the label and how it was</v>

1137
00:57:48.221 --> 00:57:49.690
<v Speaker 2>marketed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1138
00:57:49.691 --> 00:57:50.350
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's,</v>

1139
00:57:50.350 --> 00:57:52.630
<v Speaker 2>that's likely the candidate of where it</v>
<v Speaker 2>came from.</v>

1140
00:57:53.110 --> 00:57:54.850
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the analysis would be,</v>

1141
00:57:54.851 --> 00:57:55.684
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1142
00:57:55.930 --> 00:57:58.840
<v Speaker 2>that pool will be careful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's sharks swimming in that pool.</v>

1143
00:57:58.841 --> 00:58:02.380
<v Speaker 2>They can eat you and the person jumps in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the water anyway saying like,</v>

1144
00:58:02.381 --> 00:58:05.560
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to get eaten by a shark,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but shark comes up and ate them.</v>

1145
00:58:05.561 --> 00:58:06.730
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1146
00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:09.310
<v Speaker 2>we told you that this was the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You didn't follow that.</v>

1147
00:58:09.311 --> 00:58:13.420
<v Speaker 2>Now there also needs to be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>differentiation between someone who's</v>

1148
00:58:13.421 --> 00:58:15.340
<v Speaker 2>intentional cheating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>intentionally cheating,</v>

1149
00:58:15.700 --> 00:58:17.280
<v Speaker 2>and someone that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1150
00:58:17.300 --> 00:58:22.300
<v Speaker 2>makes a naive supplement choice there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there needs to be a differentiation</v>

1151
00:58:22.301 --> 00:58:23.320
<v Speaker 2>between that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there was,</v>

1152
00:58:23.321 --> 00:58:24.940
<v Speaker 2>in that case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>josh didn't get,</v>

1153
00:58:25.250 --> 00:58:27.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the full penalty of what was,</v>

1154
00:58:28.030 --> 00:58:31.960
<v Speaker 2>what that substance would have rendered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he did have to go through a long</v>

1155
00:58:31.961 --> 00:58:33.850
<v Speaker 2>period of time where he was unable to</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>

1156
00:58:34.450 --> 00:58:35.261
<v Speaker 2>He did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1157
00:58:35.261 --> 00:58:36.041
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1158
00:58:36.041 --> 00:58:38.620
<v Speaker 2>he had the prohibited substance in his</v>
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>

1159
00:58:38.890 --> 00:58:40.140
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you saw it,</v>

1160
00:58:40.141 --> 00:58:41.200
<v Speaker 2>it has to look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1161
00:58:41.380 --> 00:58:43.630
<v Speaker 2>even though you did that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't do that on purpose,</v>

1162
00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:46.180
<v Speaker 2>did that give you a performance</v>
<v Speaker 2>enhancing benefit?</v>

1163
00:58:46.210 --> 00:58:48.190
<v Speaker 2>Did it allow you to recover a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 2>better?</v>

1164
00:58:48.191 --> 00:58:51.280
<v Speaker 2>Did it make you a little bit stronger?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1165
00:58:51.330 --> 00:58:54.160
<v Speaker 2>that's why those strict liability</v>
<v Speaker 2>provisions are in there.</v>

1166
00:58:54.220 --> 00:58:56.980
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise people would just take these</v>
<v Speaker 2>prohibited supplements and say,</v>

1167
00:58:56.981 --> 00:58:58.680
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know exactly it was just</v>

1168
00:58:58.690 --> 00:58:59.700
<v Speaker 2>accident.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1169
00:58:59.710 --> 00:59:00.940
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're getting a benefit for.</v>

1170
00:59:00.941 --> 00:59:03.190
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they have to have some sort of</v>

1171
00:59:03.191 --> 00:59:04.990
<v Speaker 2>penalty in place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

1172
00:59:05.080 --> 00:59:06.940
<v Speaker 2>Now I also think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1173
00:59:06.941 --> 00:59:11.200
<v Speaker 2>there needs to be a differentiation</v>
<v Speaker 2>between the intentional not intentional.</v>

1174
00:59:11.201 --> 00:59:15.670
<v Speaker 2>And we do have that in our policy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are definitely mitigating factors</v>

1175
00:59:15.671 --> 00:59:18.310
<v Speaker 2>available in our policy that if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't do things on purpose,</v>

1176
00:59:18.640 --> 00:59:20.410
<v Speaker 2>you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not sanctioned as hi.</v>

1177
00:59:20.430 --> 00:59:21.950
<v Speaker 2>Tim means is a great example there.</v>

1178
00:59:21.950 --> 00:59:25.320
<v Speaker 2>So tim means used a relatively benign</v>
<v Speaker 2>supplement.</v>

1179
00:59:25.321 --> 00:59:27.470
<v Speaker 2>It was a creatine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>creatine,</v>

1180
00:59:27.530 --> 00:59:30.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>generally doesn't have an issue as,</v>

1181
00:59:30.471 --> 00:59:32.690
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as opposed like testosterone booster</v>

1182
00:59:32.691 --> 00:59:35.510
<v Speaker 2>supplements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We tell our athletes stay away from</v>

1183
00:59:35.511 --> 00:59:38.310
<v Speaker 2>anything marketing as a testosterone</v>
<v Speaker 2>booster.</v>

1184
00:59:38.311 --> 00:59:41.840
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the most common with</v>
<v Speaker 2>contaminants are purposefully spiking</v>

1185
00:59:42.020 --> 00:59:45.470
<v Speaker 2>purposeful spikings to means use a</v>
<v Speaker 2>creatine.</v>

1186
00:59:45.800 --> 00:59:49.100
<v Speaker 2>It had a austrian and in a very small</v>
<v Speaker 2>amount,</v>

1187
00:59:49.340 --> 00:59:52.020
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we found it in their australian is the</v>

1188
00:59:52.021 --> 00:59:54.350
<v Speaker 2>two year sanction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got six months,</v>

1189
00:59:54.790 --> 00:59:55.860
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1190
00:59:56.010 --> 00:59:58.880
<v Speaker 2>so back relatively quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think that's the thing with yoel</v>

1191
00:59:58.881 --> 01:00:03.260
<v Speaker 2>romero so correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yoel romero used a natural diuretic</v>

1192
01:00:03.261 --> 01:00:08.030
<v Speaker 2>product that had a psalm in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in all these cases,</v>

1193
01:00:08.420 --> 01:00:13.420
<v Speaker 2>not only does the prohibited substance</v>
<v Speaker 2>need to show up and what the athlete has</v>

1194
01:00:13.491 --> 01:00:17.480
<v Speaker 2>says they've used our ready to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to protect against making sure the</v>

1195
01:00:17.481 --> 01:00:21.350
<v Speaker 2>athlete isn't purposely spiking it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you saddle will go out on their own,</v>

1196
01:00:21.590 --> 01:00:24.110
<v Speaker 2>on the market,</v>
<v Speaker 2>independently procure,</v>

1197
01:00:24.111 --> 01:00:25.880
<v Speaker 2>hopefully the same lot of product.</v>

1198
01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:29.300
<v Speaker 2>And in the case of joelle and tim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were able to do that,</v>

1199
01:00:29.330 --> 01:00:31.700
<v Speaker 2>test it completely independently of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>athlete,</v>

1200
01:00:32.170 --> 01:00:34.880
<v Speaker 2>determine what level of the prohibited</v>
<v Speaker 2>substances in that,</v>

1201
01:00:35.390 --> 01:00:38.060
<v Speaker 2>based on the interview with the athlete</v>
<v Speaker 2>of how much did you use,</v>

1202
01:00:38.061 --> 01:00:40.940
<v Speaker 2>when's the last time you used it</v>
<v Speaker 2>relative to this test,</v>

1203
01:00:41.330 --> 01:00:44.990
<v Speaker 2>do the science calculations just to make</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure an athlete's not saying,</v>

1204
01:00:44.991 --> 01:00:49.010
<v Speaker 2>well I know this creatine is spiked with</v>
<v Speaker 2>australian so I'm going to go use</v>

1205
01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:52.880
<v Speaker 2>austrian and then I have a built in</v>
<v Speaker 2>excuse when I test positive for</v>

1206
01:00:52.881 --> 01:00:56.660
<v Speaker 2>australian in order to be able to match</v>
<v Speaker 2>contaminant levels with what's being</v>

1207
01:00:56.661 --> 01:01:00.320
<v Speaker 2>excreted in the urine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would literally have to have phd</v>

1208
01:01:00.321 --> 01:01:03.650
<v Speaker 2>chemistry degree and I'm not aware of of</v>
<v Speaker 2>any of our athletes have in that.</v>

1209
01:01:03.651 --> 01:01:05.450
<v Speaker 2>It'd be very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very difficult to do that.</v>

1210
01:01:05.630 --> 01:01:07.250
<v Speaker 2>And so these detection levels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1211
01:01:07.251 --> 01:01:08.810
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about nana grams.</v>

1212
01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:12.500
<v Speaker 2>We're not talking about large quantities</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would work pika grams grams.</v>

1213
01:01:12.501 --> 01:01:13.334
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

1214
01:01:13.430 --> 01:01:17.990
<v Speaker 2>Now what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why was,</v>

1215
01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:24.280
<v Speaker 2>why was this moved from vegas to</v>
<v Speaker 2>California and why?</v>

1216
01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:27.440
<v Speaker 2>Why did the California state athletic</v>
<v Speaker 2>commission,</v>

1217
01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:30.710
<v Speaker 2>why did they accept this fight taking</v>
<v Speaker 2>place here?</v>

1218
01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:35.920
<v Speaker 2>And why did vegas say no to it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So internally the ufc wise,</v>

1219
01:01:36.171 --> 01:01:38.000
<v Speaker 2>we first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in fact donna marcaine,</v>

1220
01:01:38.030 --> 01:01:40.880
<v Speaker 2>who you know who works with me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a shout out to donna.</v>

1221
01:01:40.980 --> 01:01:44.150
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're a two person shop and the woman's</v>

1222
01:01:44.151 --> 01:01:45.830
<v Speaker 2>a hawks and one of the hardest workers I</v>
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>

1223
01:01:45.831 --> 01:01:47.480
<v Speaker 2>So she's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's awesome.</v>

1224
01:01:47.570 --> 01:01:51.230
<v Speaker 2>She's taken a look at something that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>have access to called the clearinghouse</v>

1225
01:01:51.290 --> 01:01:55.730
<v Speaker 2>and it's basically a recording of all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tests on our athletes so we can get</v>

1226
01:01:55.731 --> 01:01:56.960
<v Speaker 2>on there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody says,</v>

1227
01:01:56.961 --> 01:01:58.970
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many times was john tested last</v>

1228
01:01:58.971 --> 01:02:01.700
<v Speaker 2>quarter?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can get on there and pull that up.</v>

1229
01:02:02.150 --> 01:02:04.880
<v Speaker 2>The public also has access to our</v>
<v Speaker 2>testing records,</v>

1230
01:02:04.881 --> 01:02:07.500
<v Speaker 2>not with a specificity that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>clearinghouse has,</v>

1231
01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:11.390
<v Speaker 2>but the public can get on and you saw it</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a weekly basis.</v>

1232
01:02:13.100 --> 01:02:15.080
<v Speaker 2>Updates how many tests and athletes</v>
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>

1233
01:02:15.081 --> 01:02:17.810
<v Speaker 2>So there's some of these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some guys out there on the internet from</v>

1234
01:02:17.811 --> 01:02:21.870
<v Speaker 2>the day one of the program have kept</v>
<v Speaker 2>track of what week they're numbers tick</v>

1235
01:02:21.871 --> 01:02:25.200
<v Speaker 2>up so you can go find spreadsheets on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the internet at least from a,</v>

1236
01:02:25.230 --> 01:02:27.960
<v Speaker 2>from a weekly basis of when our athletes</v>
<v Speaker 2>were tested.</v>

1237
01:02:27.961 --> 01:02:30.420
<v Speaker 2>Now many times every week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>god bless those dorks.</v>

1238
01:02:30.450 --> 01:02:31.283
<v Speaker 2>Crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>huh?</v>

1239
01:02:32.250 --> 01:02:35.430
<v Speaker 2>So the clearinghouse program is very</v>
<v Speaker 2>specific.</v>

1240
01:02:35.431 --> 01:02:39.210
<v Speaker 2>We can get on there and see the actual</v>
<v Speaker 2>date of the collection and next to that</v>

1241
01:02:39.211 --> 01:02:42.540
<v Speaker 2>we see negative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>positive or pending.</v>

1242
01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:46.200
<v Speaker 2>So donna came to me late november,</v>
<v Speaker 2>early december saying,</v>

1243
01:02:46.201 --> 01:02:48.780
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking at john's tests and I'm</v>

1244
01:02:48.781 --> 01:02:53.340
<v Speaker 2>seeing pending still back from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was maybe august,</v>

1245
01:02:53.341 --> 01:02:56.310
<v Speaker 2>september.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think something's going on here.</v>

1246
01:02:56.311 --> 01:02:57.480
<v Speaker 2>And of course I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1247
01:02:57.481 --> 01:02:59.550
<v Speaker 2>well he's fighting pretty soon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope not,</v>

1248
01:02:59.551 --> 01:03:01.740
<v Speaker 2>but let me reach out to you sada.</v>

1249
01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:03.750
<v Speaker 2>So I reached out to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>

1250
01:03:04.470 --> 01:03:07.380
<v Speaker 2>we're working on something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're conducting a study,</v>

1251
01:03:07.381 --> 01:03:09.240
<v Speaker 2>we're talking to other professional</v>
<v Speaker 2>sports leagues,</v>

1252
01:03:09.241 --> 01:03:13.080
<v Speaker 2>we're talking to the laboratories out</v>
<v Speaker 2>there and don't have an answer for you</v>

1253
01:03:13.081 --> 01:03:14.340
<v Speaker 2>now that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but stand by.</v>

1254
01:03:14.341 --> 01:03:19.341
<v Speaker 2>So I think it was a december six.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They sent a letter to us and they sent a</v>

1255
01:03:20.431 --> 01:03:23.610
<v Speaker 2>letter to the Nevada state athletic</v>
<v Speaker 2>commission saying,</v>

1256
01:03:24.030 --> 01:03:27.090
<v Speaker 2>just so you're aware,</v>
<v Speaker 2>over the last six months,</v>

1257
01:03:27.210 --> 01:03:29.070
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>early in this six months,</v>

1258
01:03:29.071 --> 01:03:34.071
<v Speaker 2>we've seen a reemergence of this</v>
<v Speaker 2>longterm metabolite in john's samples.</v>

1259
01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:37.350
<v Speaker 2>We lost was this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this was early december,</v>

1260
01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:38.900
<v Speaker 2>December 6th,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1261
01:03:39.110 --> 01:03:41.520
<v Speaker 2>we and the Nevada athletic commission</v>
<v Speaker 2>were notified.</v>

1262
01:03:41.910 --> 01:03:44.250
<v Speaker 2>You were notified,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the test was from previous.</v>

1263
01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:46.230
<v Speaker 2>Just so the tests,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these tests,</v>

1264
01:03:46.350 --> 01:03:51.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm covered from august through</v>
<v Speaker 2>november.</v>

1265
01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:55.110
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's white test.</v>

1266
01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:56.340
<v Speaker 2>Several of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1267
01:03:56.341 --> 01:03:59.220
<v Speaker 2>so more than one test showed this</v>
<v Speaker 2>metabolite.</v>

1268
01:03:59.221 --> 01:04:04.080
<v Speaker 2>So what they said was August 9th,</v>
<v Speaker 2>negative August 29th,</v>

1269
01:04:04.110 --> 01:04:07.230
<v Speaker 2>eight pika grams,</v>
<v Speaker 2>September 18th,</v>

1270
01:04:07.290 --> 01:04:09.390
<v Speaker 2>eight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight September 18th.</v>

1271
01:04:09.390 --> 01:04:10.920
<v Speaker 2>So I mean there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a good.</v>

1272
01:04:11.820 --> 01:04:14.850
<v Speaker 2>So he's negative on the ninth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 days later.</v>

1273
01:04:14.851 --> 01:04:17.940
<v Speaker 2>So inside the 22 two checkups,</v>
<v Speaker 2>22 day window,</v>

1274
01:04:18.090 --> 01:04:21.930
<v Speaker 2>he shows an eight pika gram,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no short term metabolites,</v>

1275
01:04:21.931 --> 01:04:23.700
<v Speaker 2>no longterm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no parent,</v>

1276
01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:25.380
<v Speaker 2>no medium term,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no medium.</v>

1277
01:04:25.381 --> 01:04:26.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No medium and longterm.</v>

1278
01:04:26.970 --> 01:04:28.220
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1279
01:04:28.710 --> 01:04:32.520
<v Speaker 2>we then go to the 18th of September,</v>
<v Speaker 2>19 pika grams.</v>

1280
01:04:33.510 --> 01:04:35.820
<v Speaker 2>And then that's followed by four</v>
<v Speaker 2>negative tests,</v>

1281
01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:39.690
<v Speaker 2>September 21st october,</v>
<v Speaker 2>second,</v>

1282
01:04:40.110 --> 01:04:43.860
<v Speaker 2>October 11th and November 14th.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So at this point,</v>

1283
01:04:44.310 --> 01:04:45.960
<v Speaker 2>late november,</v>
<v Speaker 2>early december,</v>

1284
01:04:46.310 --> 01:04:47.610
<v Speaker 2>you saw it says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1285
01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:51.660
<v Speaker 2>we've done our studying those two low</v>
<v Speaker 2>levels in august,</v>

1286
01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:55.130
<v Speaker 2>our residual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no evidence of any real</v>

1287
01:04:55.131 --> 01:04:58.080
<v Speaker 2>administration based on lack of short</v>
<v Speaker 2>and medium term.</v>

1288
01:04:58.081 --> 01:05:02.430
<v Speaker 2>And parent based on our consultation</v>
<v Speaker 2>with other leagues with these labs that</v>

1289
01:05:02.431 --> 01:05:04.590
<v Speaker 2>are seeing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're calling this,</v>

1290
01:05:04.591 --> 01:05:06.990
<v Speaker 2>this is would be double jeopardy if we</v>
<v Speaker 2>did them again.</v>

1291
01:05:07.050 --> 01:05:09.360
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is something that should be</v>

1292
01:05:09.361 --> 01:05:12.060
<v Speaker 2>really emphasized because there's a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of people that don't understand this.</v>

1293
01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:16.770
<v Speaker 2>This is not just this one test.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are many tasks that have been done</v>

1294
01:05:16.771 --> 01:05:21.160
<v Speaker 2>over the course of john suspension and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then ultimately relicensing that are</v>

1295
01:05:21.161 --> 01:05:26.161
<v Speaker 2>showing this exact same metabolite at a</v>
<v Speaker 2>very similar level that according to</v>

1296
01:05:26.891 --> 01:05:29.860
<v Speaker 2>previous tests,</v>
<v Speaker 2>specifically on clomiphene,</v>

1297
01:05:29.890 --> 01:05:34.890
<v Speaker 2>that this could be this pulsing correct</v>
<v Speaker 2>result of existing and not existing.</v>

1298
01:05:35.590 --> 01:05:40.590
<v Speaker 2>But this is not indicative in any way</v>
<v Speaker 2>that can be provable of microdosing.</v>

1299
01:05:41.410 --> 01:05:43.270
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And not only that,</v>

1300
01:05:43.271 --> 01:05:46.720
<v Speaker 2>but this is over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about this being over long</v>

1301
01:05:46.780 --> 01:05:48.820
<v Speaker 2>term,</v>
<v Speaker 2>long periods of time.</v>

1302
01:05:48.850 --> 01:05:50.070
<v Speaker 2>Many months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

1303
01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:53.140
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And consistent numbers over many months.</v>

1304
01:05:53.141 --> 01:05:54.160
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1305
01:05:54.161 --> 01:05:57.540
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going back to what one expert Dr. Bauer</v>

1306
01:05:57.541 --> 01:05:58.900
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to be careful what you're</v>

1307
01:05:58.901 --> 01:06:02.110
<v Speaker 2>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Single double number rams.</v>

1308
01:06:02.111 --> 01:06:04.270
<v Speaker 2>And you see some variance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to be careful about saying,</v>

1309
01:06:04.271 --> 01:06:07.630
<v Speaker 2>well it went from nine to 18.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means real administration,</v>

1310
01:06:07.690 --> 01:06:10.630
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's inexact science at that level.</v>

1311
01:06:10.630 --> 01:06:13.690
<v Speaker 2>The water labs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a non threshold substance,</v>

1312
01:06:14.020 --> 01:06:17.770
<v Speaker 2>so all his water requires them to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to report back to water,</v>

1313
01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:21.460
<v Speaker 2>positive or negative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not required to quantify.</v>

1314
01:06:21.790 --> 01:06:23.140
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these water labs,</v>

1315
01:06:23.141 --> 01:06:26.620
<v Speaker 2>I've also realized there's an issue when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're getting under pika grams.</v>

1316
01:06:26.980 --> 01:06:30.760
<v Speaker 2>So what they're doing is going back</v>
<v Speaker 2>after reporting the positive,</v>

1317
01:06:30.761 --> 01:06:32.590
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's see if we can estimate with this</v>

1318
01:06:32.591 --> 01:06:37.540
<v Speaker 2>level is it's an inexact science at pika</v>
<v Speaker 2>gram quantities and my understanding,</v>

1319
01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:40.750
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to estimate what those levels are.</v>

1320
01:06:40.990 --> 01:06:42.520
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can see some variations.</v>

1321
01:06:42.550 --> 01:06:47.550
<v Speaker 2>So Nevada is unwilling to sanction the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight based on all this information.</v>

1322
01:06:49.871 --> 01:06:52.750
<v Speaker 2>So they get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get the initial notice that we got.</v>

1323
01:06:52.751 --> 01:06:55.030
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was december six saying,</v>

1324
01:06:55.150 --> 01:06:57.070
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was an issue in,</v>

1325
01:06:57.160 --> 01:06:59.380
<v Speaker 2>in august these longterm metabolites</v>
<v Speaker 2>reappeared.</v>

1326
01:06:59.390 --> 01:07:02.440
<v Speaker 2>Appeared again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we've since had four negative tests.</v>

1327
01:07:02.890 --> 01:07:05.070
<v Speaker 2>We don't believe that the august,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1328
01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:07.420
<v Speaker 2>reappearance is a re administration.</v>

1329
01:07:07.450 --> 01:07:09.700
<v Speaker 2>There's no sanction here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nevada,</v>

1330
01:07:09.701 --> 01:07:12.310
<v Speaker 2>you don't even have jurisdiction over</v>
<v Speaker 2>the august test.</v>

1331
01:07:12.340 --> 01:07:14.380
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep in mind these are ufc tests.</v>

1332
01:07:14.381 --> 01:07:16.870
<v Speaker 2>Nevada doesn't mandate it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Nevada says,</v>

1333
01:07:16.871 --> 01:07:19.390
<v Speaker 2>look closer to a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We do take jurisdiction.</v>

1334
01:07:19.391 --> 01:07:24.391
<v Speaker 2>We will adopt these usada tests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you saw it didn't need to to notify.</v>

1335
01:07:24.431 --> 01:07:26.290
<v Speaker 2>They thought out of an abundance of</v>
<v Speaker 2>caution,</v>

1336
01:07:26.291 --> 01:07:29.230
<v Speaker 2>let's let Nevada know that this issue</v>
<v Speaker 2>exists.</v>

1337
01:07:29.430 --> 01:07:32.110
<v Speaker 2>Goddamn usada what they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but wait,</v>

1338
01:07:32.270 --> 01:07:34.750
<v Speaker 2>that's all good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you saw that it gets this.</v>

1339
01:07:34.990 --> 01:07:35.890
<v Speaker 2>I talked with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

1340
01:07:35.891 --> 01:07:36.790
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

1341
01:07:37.180 --> 01:07:39.460
<v Speaker 2>this is concerning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we don't see anything within our</v>

1342
01:07:39.461 --> 01:07:43.780
<v Speaker 2>jurisdiction here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I certainly hope that no subsequent</v>

1343
01:07:43.781 --> 01:07:46.810
<v Speaker 2>tests show up positive because that</v>
<v Speaker 2>could be an issue.</v>

1344
01:07:46.811 --> 01:07:51.070
<v Speaker 2>And sure enough you saw to collect a</v>
<v Speaker 2>sample from john on 12,</v>

1345
01:07:51.071 --> 01:07:53.710
<v Speaker 2>nine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they expedited the results because they</v>

1346
01:07:53.711 --> 01:07:57.850
<v Speaker 2>knew the fight was coming up and they do</v>
<v Speaker 2>that now when fights or clothes or the</v>

1347
01:07:57.851 --> 01:08:00.490
<v Speaker 2>collections are done close to a fight</v>
<v Speaker 2>and here,</v>

1348
01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:03.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he pulses back up to uh,</v>

1349
01:08:03.220 --> 01:08:05.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>between 60 and 80 pika grams.</v>

1350
01:08:06.490 --> 01:08:08.360
<v Speaker 2>So Nevada gets this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1351
01:08:08.510 --> 01:08:09.510
<v Speaker 2>this was last week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1352
01:08:09.530 --> 01:08:12.040
<v Speaker 2>the days of run together for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1353
01:08:12.130 --> 01:08:13.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a week ago,</v>

1354
01:08:13.631 --> 01:08:17.630
<v Speaker 2>friday we have in a bob bennett who's</v>
<v Speaker 2>the executive director.</v>

1355
01:08:17.690 --> 01:08:20.900
<v Speaker 2>While I'm a big fan of these great guys</v>
<v Speaker 2>talked shit about Nevada,</v>

1356
01:08:20.901 --> 01:08:23.820
<v Speaker 2>but I remember fbi agent so we gotten a</v>
<v Speaker 2>ton of ground.</v>

1357
01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:27.230
<v Speaker 2>He is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's one of the reasons why it probably</v>

1358
01:08:27.231 --> 01:08:29.750
<v Speaker 2>wasn't sanctioned in Nevada was because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're so by the book.</v>

1359
01:08:29.930 --> 01:08:32.000
<v Speaker 2>I get angry because I wanted to fight to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be in Nevada,</v>

1360
01:08:32.001 --> 01:08:35.650
<v Speaker 2>but I understand bob's position that</v>
<v Speaker 2>implicitly so.</v>

1361
01:08:35.651 --> 01:08:37.940
<v Speaker 2>So let me make clear what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bob came in,</v>

1362
01:08:37.941 --> 01:08:40.790
<v Speaker 2>Anthony Martin elle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the chairman of the commission came in</v>

1363
01:08:40.791 --> 01:08:44.090
<v Speaker 2>and a couple representatives from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>vat attorney general's office.</v>

1364
01:08:44.091 --> 01:08:49.091
<v Speaker 2>So they are the ones that prosecute and</v>
<v Speaker 2>cases involving ped use at violates</v>

1365
01:08:49.971 --> 01:08:54.010
<v Speaker 2>Nevada regs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we share all this with them and list</v>

1366
01:08:54.020 --> 01:08:54.853
<v Speaker 2>like you did with me.</v>

1367
01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:57.200
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Share it all with them and look,</v>

1368
01:08:57.201 --> 01:09:01.220
<v Speaker 2>there's some misconception out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did not say this fight absolutely</v>

1369
01:09:01.221 --> 01:09:03.590
<v Speaker 2>not happening next week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

1370
01:09:04.100 --> 01:09:06.620
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're understanding these</v>

1371
01:09:06.621 --> 01:09:07.730
<v Speaker 2>issues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but said,</v>

1372
01:09:07.731 --> 01:09:08.630
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1373
01:09:09.170 --> 01:09:13.400
<v Speaker 2>optically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this doesn't look great and we feel that</v>

1374
01:09:13.401 --> 01:09:17.840
<v Speaker 2>out of an abundance of caution that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>need to have a public hearing and be</v>

1375
01:09:17.841 --> 01:09:20.780
<v Speaker 2>very transparent about this because this</v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

1376
01:09:21.310 --> 01:09:23.690
<v Speaker 2>This is some weird shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1377
01:09:24.140 --> 01:09:26.720
<v Speaker 2>this was last friday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we're eight days out from the fight,</v>

1378
01:09:26.750 --> 01:09:27.520
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1379
01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:28.640
<v Speaker 2>we start talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1380
01:09:28.641 --> 01:09:33.641
<v Speaker 2>when can we potentially have this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And unfortunately christmas holiday,</v>

1381
01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:38.750
<v Speaker 2>several of the commissioners weren't</v>
<v Speaker 2>even in town and basically what they</v>

1382
01:09:38.751 --> 01:09:39.590
<v Speaker 2>said is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1383
01:09:39.770 --> 01:09:42.290
<v Speaker 2>we will absolutely do this if you want</v>
<v Speaker 2>us to,</v>

1384
01:09:42.710 --> 01:09:45.470
<v Speaker 2>but likely that hearing would not be</v>
<v Speaker 2>until tuesday,</v>

1385
01:09:45.650 --> 01:09:47.510
<v Speaker 2>thursday or maybe tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>friday.</v>

1386
01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:49.850
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>marinello is like,</v>

1387
01:09:49.851 --> 01:09:50.480
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1388
01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:52.760
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm starting to get my head around this,</v>

1389
01:09:53.150 --> 01:09:57.440
<v Speaker 2>but I can't guarantee you that my other</v>
<v Speaker 2>commissioners or me are going to come</v>

1390
01:09:57.441 --> 01:09:58.190
<v Speaker 2>out the same way.</v>

1391
01:09:58.190 --> 01:10:01.150
<v Speaker 2>So you're taking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're taking a chance here that,</v>

1392
01:10:01.210 --> 01:10:02.390
<v Speaker 2>that we could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1393
01:10:02.420 --> 01:10:04.350
<v Speaker 2>we need more information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

1394
01:10:04.540 --> 01:10:07.700
<v Speaker 2>So basically they were willing to listen</v>
<v Speaker 2>to it.</v>

1395
01:10:07.910 --> 01:10:10.310
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they were starting to wrap their</v>

1396
01:10:10.311 --> 01:10:14.270
<v Speaker 2>heads around it but didn't feel that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were up to speed enough on it.</v>

1397
01:10:14.860 --> 01:10:17.540
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't have the luxury that andy</v>

1398
01:10:17.541 --> 01:10:21.740
<v Speaker 2>foster and California have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember when john tested positive in</v>

1399
01:10:21.741 --> 01:10:23.150
<v Speaker 2>July,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2018,</v>

1400
01:10:23.510 --> 01:10:27.860
<v Speaker 2>that fight was in California because</v>
<v Speaker 2>that fight was in California,</v>

1401
01:10:28.010 --> 01:10:32.270
<v Speaker 2>California retained jurisdiction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've had two very public hearings on</v>

1402
01:10:32.271 --> 01:10:36.620
<v Speaker 2>john when they suspended his license and</v>
<v Speaker 2>most recently a week and a half ago when</v>

1403
01:10:36.621 --> 01:10:40.220
<v Speaker 2>they reinstated his license.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So andy in the commission,</v>

1404
01:10:40.490 --> 01:10:43.340
<v Speaker 2>we're very familiar with the world</v>
<v Speaker 2>termina ball.</v>

1405
01:10:43.700 --> 01:10:48.440
<v Speaker 2>They were very familiar with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>longterm metabolite and in fact andy was</v>

1406
01:10:48.441 --> 01:10:51.590
<v Speaker 2>somewhat critical of usada during the</v>
<v Speaker 2>last hearing.</v>

1407
01:10:51.860 --> 01:10:55.370
<v Speaker 2>He thought after looking at all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>details after reading,</v>

1408
01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:58.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mclaren's a position that there was no</v>

1409
01:10:58.611 --> 01:11:00.860
<v Speaker 2>evidence that this was done on purpose.</v>

1410
01:11:01.130 --> 01:11:01.941
<v Speaker 2>He thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1411
01:11:01.941 --> 01:11:05.000
<v Speaker 2>maybe they went a little bit hard on him</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he stated that in that,</v>

1412
01:11:05.001 --> 01:11:10.001
<v Speaker 2>in that second hearing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So with the reemergence of the pika gram</v>

1413
01:11:10.191 --> 01:11:14.490
<v Speaker 2>quantity of this m three longterm</v>
<v Speaker 2>metabolite andy in the commission,</v>

1414
01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:17.730
<v Speaker 2>unlike Nevada,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't need to get up to speed on it.</v>

1415
01:11:17.731 --> 01:11:20.940
<v Speaker 2>They've already had two public hearings</v>
<v Speaker 2>on john's issue.</v>

1416
01:11:21.150 --> 01:11:26.150
<v Speaker 2>They were intimately familiar with some</v>
<v Speaker 2>of these dynamics of this drug and the</v>

1417
01:11:26.371 --> 01:11:29.610
<v Speaker 2>metabolites and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's why he felt comfortable based</v>

1418
01:11:29.611 --> 01:11:34.611
<v Speaker 2>on their familiarization with it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>based on these written absolute</v>

1419
01:11:34.801 --> 01:11:38.580
<v Speaker 2>statements by these experts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there was no real ingestion one.</v>

1420
01:11:38.820 --> 01:11:42.150
<v Speaker 2>And then the second thing which we</v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't covered is these experts said,</v>

1421
01:11:42.210 --> 01:11:45.810
<v Speaker 2>based on these low level pika grams,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no performance enhancing</v>

1422
01:11:45.811 --> 01:11:49.770
<v Speaker 2>benefit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's an important point because if</v>

1423
01:11:49.771 --> 01:11:54.771
<v Speaker 2>you would've told you fc look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is still remnants from a year and a</v>

1424
01:11:54.930 --> 01:11:57.570
<v Speaker 2>half ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we can't rule out that he's not</v>

1425
01:11:57.571 --> 01:11:59.880
<v Speaker 2>getting a performance enhancing benefit</v>
<v Speaker 2>from it.</v>

1426
01:12:00.250 --> 01:12:01.950
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that instance I'll tell you,</v>

1427
01:12:01.951 --> 01:12:03.080
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1428
01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:06.240
<v Speaker 2>I stand by this I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>w I would leave this company if somebody</v>

1429
01:12:06.241 --> 01:12:09.180
<v Speaker 2>told me otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there was any indication that there</v>

1430
01:12:09.181 --> 01:12:11.970
<v Speaker 2>would be a benefit from him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though it technically wasn't a</v>

1431
01:12:11.971 --> 01:12:15.240
<v Speaker 2>violation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to stand by while anybody</v>

1432
01:12:15.241 --> 01:12:18.150
<v Speaker 2>licenses that guy to fight could have</v>
<v Speaker 2>been.</v>

1433
01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:23.240
<v Speaker 2>Could this have been somehow or another</v>
<v Speaker 2>mitigated by communicating these results</v>

1434
01:12:25.531 --> 01:12:28.140
<v Speaker 2>to Nevada earlier?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1435
01:12:28.141 --> 01:12:32.730
<v Speaker 2>we didn't announce the fight that john</v>
<v Speaker 2>was going to fight and in Nevada until</v>

1436
01:12:32.790 --> 01:12:34.920
<v Speaker 2>october,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in october.</v>

1437
01:12:34.921 --> 01:12:36.720
<v Speaker 2>So you have said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey look,</v>

1438
01:12:36.750 --> 01:12:38.070
<v Speaker 2>here's this issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1439
01:12:38.610 --> 01:12:41.550
<v Speaker 2>Potentially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the issue was you saw that hadn't</v>

1440
01:12:41.551 --> 01:12:46.290
<v Speaker 2>come to that they were in the middle of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that point of consulting with other</v>

1441
01:12:46.291 --> 01:12:49.440
<v Speaker 2>professional sports leagues with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>other water labs.</v>

1442
01:12:49.441 --> 01:12:51.780
<v Speaker 2>They hadn't reached their conclusion</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1443
01:12:51.781 --> 01:12:54.060
<v Speaker 2>Science expert hadn't determined,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1444
01:12:54.090 --> 01:12:55.560
<v Speaker 2>this is definitely residual.</v>

1445
01:12:55.560 --> 01:12:58.260
<v Speaker 2>No performance dancing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were still going through that data</v>

1446
01:12:58.261 --> 01:13:00.630
<v Speaker 2>at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what they've told me is,</v>

1447
01:13:00.631 --> 01:13:02.790
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we tried to hurry that along as fast as</v>

1448
01:13:02.791 --> 01:13:05.260
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We wanted to make sure that,</v>

1449
01:13:05.261 --> 01:13:08.940
<v Speaker 2>that we went through this and very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very detailed and no stone left</v>

1450
01:13:08.941 --> 01:13:09.960
<v Speaker 2>unturned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When,</v>

1451
01:13:09.961 --> 01:13:12.140
<v Speaker 2>when did they reach this conclusion?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This.</v>

1452
01:13:12.141 --> 01:13:14.390
<v Speaker 2>So this was early december.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So December 6th,</v>

1453
01:13:14.391 --> 01:13:18.090
<v Speaker 2>that letter went out saying we've had</v>
<v Speaker 2>these two low level positives back in</v>

1454
01:13:18.091 --> 01:13:19.080
<v Speaker 2>august.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're okay,</v>

1455
01:13:19.081 --> 01:13:21.750
<v Speaker 2>but here we are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is the end of december.</v>

1456
01:13:21.930 --> 01:13:25.380
<v Speaker 2>What could this have been headed off at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pass?</v>

1457
01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:26.191
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1458
01:13:26.191 --> 01:13:29.550
<v Speaker 2>when Nevada first got notified,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they thought like,</v>

1459
01:13:29.551 --> 01:13:30.600
<v Speaker 2>we were hoping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1460
01:13:30.601 --> 01:13:33.930
<v Speaker 2>he's had four negative tests,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he's probably going to be negative</v>

1461
01:13:33.931 --> 01:13:35.340
<v Speaker 2>going forward here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1462
01:13:35.370 --> 01:13:36.203
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what,</v>

1463
01:13:36.220 --> 01:13:37.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lay person would think,</v>

1464
01:13:37.651 --> 01:13:39.540
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's probably out of the woods now,</v>

1465
01:13:39.990 --> 01:13:41.160
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1466
01:13:41.161 --> 01:13:45.750
<v Speaker 2>getting back to what period of time is</v>
<v Speaker 2>this in john's preparation and if you</v>

1467
01:13:45.751 --> 01:13:50.040
<v Speaker 2>look at some of these numbers and when</v>
<v Speaker 2>these metabolites appear and disappear</v>

1468
01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:54.660
<v Speaker 2>in early august,</v>
<v Speaker 2>john was preparing his defense for this</v>

1469
01:13:54.661 --> 01:13:55.470
<v Speaker 2>arbitration.</v>

1470
01:13:55.470 --> 01:13:58.500
<v Speaker 2>I think he had an idea based on talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>to his attorneys like,</v>

1471
01:13:58.501 --> 01:14:01.230
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got a pretty good shot here of some</v>

1472
01:14:01.231 --> 01:14:04.470
<v Speaker 2>mitigating factors where this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>potentially going to get reduced.</v>

1473
01:14:04.471 --> 01:14:05.900
<v Speaker 2>So I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1474
01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.430
<v Speaker 2>he starts to get a little bit motivated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets in the gym,</v>

1475
01:14:08.431 --> 01:14:11.890
<v Speaker 2>starts training again clearly in early</v>
<v Speaker 2>december.</v>

1476
01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:15.700
<v Speaker 2>That's a period of time when our</v>
<v Speaker 2>fighters that close to a fight are</v>

1477
01:14:15.701 --> 01:14:17.830
<v Speaker 2>bringing down that body weight right</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

1478
01:14:17.890 --> 01:14:20.950
<v Speaker 2>cutting body fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're losing a little bit of water.</v>

1479
01:14:21.370 --> 01:14:24.010
<v Speaker 2>So it certainly seems to correlate</v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

1480
01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:27.110
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these pulsing effects with when this</v>

1481
01:14:27.220 --> 01:14:29.480
<v Speaker 2>theoretical right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that close tissue.</v>

1482
01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:31.180
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1483
01:14:31.181 --> 01:14:34.720
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this positive result was announced when,</v>

1484
01:14:35.380 --> 01:14:40.380
<v Speaker 2>so a week ago yesterday as you saw it as</v>
<v Speaker 2>announced,</v>

1485
01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:44.530
<v Speaker 2>sought notifies us the ufc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That always happens.</v>

1486
01:14:44.531 --> 01:14:48.220
<v Speaker 2>And they notify if any commission has</v>
<v Speaker 2>jurisdiction at this point.</v>

1487
01:14:48.221 --> 01:14:50.650
<v Speaker 2>This close to a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nevada has jurisdiction.</v>

1488
01:14:51.460 --> 01:14:56.460
<v Speaker 2>So I get the call and you can imagine</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going through my head.</v>

1489
01:14:57.160 --> 01:14:57.993
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1490
01:14:58.090 --> 01:15:00.250
<v Speaker 2>I've gotten so many of these calls now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I literally,</v>

1491
01:15:00.251 --> 01:15:05.020
<v Speaker 2>for the first five or 10 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can bury my head in my hand and think</v>

1492
01:15:05.021 --> 01:15:07.210
<v Speaker 2>through exactly how this thing's going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to play out.</v>

1493
01:15:07.780 --> 01:15:09.610
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be,</v>

1494
01:15:09.611 --> 01:15:11.110
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nevada's going to say,</v>

1495
01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:13.060
<v Speaker 2>wait a second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's going on here?</v>

1496
01:15:13.061 --> 01:15:16.540
<v Speaker 2>We need to root this out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>John's going to say,</v>

1497
01:15:16.660 --> 01:15:17.740
<v Speaker 2>jesus christ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1498
01:15:17.741 --> 01:15:20.500
<v Speaker 2>what is going on in my life?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't get a fucking break.</v>

1499
01:15:20.501 --> 01:15:25.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to be careful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I even went through with dc how dc is</v>

1500
01:15:25.211 --> 01:15:26.980
<v Speaker 2>going to react and he reacts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's going to be.</v>

1501
01:15:27.190 --> 01:15:30.400
<v Speaker 2>I fucking told you this was the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy's a cheater.</v>

1502
01:15:30.820 --> 01:15:32.260
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you saw it as bullshit,</v>

1503
01:15:32.300 --> 01:15:35.140
<v Speaker 2>novitsky bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All this stuff goes through my head and</v>

1504
01:15:35.141 --> 01:15:36.730
<v Speaker 2>the first five or 10 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>

1505
01:15:36.820 --> 01:15:38.020
<v Speaker 2>how's dana going to react?</v>

1506
01:15:38.020 --> 01:15:41.530
<v Speaker 2>How hunters are gonna react when I have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go over to his office and explained</v>

1507
01:15:41.531 --> 01:15:44.320
<v Speaker 2>this out to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It played out exactly as I saw it.</v>

1508
01:15:44.321 --> 01:15:45.060
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1509
01:15:45.060 --> 01:15:48.100
<v Speaker 2>it's some of the worst days of my career</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I get these calls.</v>

1510
01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:50.620
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1511
01:15:50.660 --> 01:15:54.700
<v Speaker 2>every bone was notified and in Nevada</v>
<v Speaker 2>was in our office two days later.</v>

1512
01:15:54.850 --> 01:15:56.020
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1513
01:15:56.080 --> 01:15:58.660
<v Speaker 2>there's been some criticism of them out</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1514
01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:02.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't fault them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a complicated issue that</v>

1515
01:16:02.620 --> 01:16:07.060
<v Speaker 2>optically doesn't look great and to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything in a rush manner would be</v>

1516
01:16:07.061 --> 01:16:09.940
<v Speaker 2>difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did everything they could to afford</v>

1517
01:16:09.941 --> 01:16:12.820
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Having a hearing problem was,</v>

1518
01:16:12.821 --> 01:16:15.250
<v Speaker 2>it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was too close to a fight.</v>

1519
01:16:15.700 --> 01:16:19.600
<v Speaker 2>So essentially to get this out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this issue with optics,</v>

1520
01:16:19.601 --> 01:16:21.610
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if you go on twitter,</v>

1521
01:16:21.611 --> 01:16:24.130
<v Speaker 2>everybody's calling him a cheat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's saying that you know,</v>

1522
01:16:24.131 --> 01:16:29.131
<v Speaker 2>anybody that sanctions this is your</v>
<v Speaker 2>sanctioning cheating for someone to get</v>

1523
01:16:30.251 --> 01:16:32.320
<v Speaker 2>an understanding of what this is like.</v>

1524
01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:36.580
<v Speaker 2>It actually requires probably more than</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've done now over the last hour and 15</v>

1525
01:16:36.581 --> 01:16:37.130
<v Speaker 2>minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1526
01:16:37.130 --> 01:16:38.950
<v Speaker 2>And I appreciate this forum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1527
01:16:38.951 --> 01:16:42.040
<v Speaker 2>dana and I went on sports center and</v>
<v Speaker 2>announced it in three minute hit and I</v>

1528
01:16:42.041 --> 01:16:44.890
<v Speaker 2>came out of there going absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone in the world's going to say,</v>

1529
01:16:44.891 --> 01:16:46.360
<v Speaker 2>this is bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't.</v>

1530
01:16:46.930 --> 01:16:48.610
<v Speaker 2>This is what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to have a hard time doing</v>

1531
01:16:48.611 --> 01:16:50.980
<v Speaker 2>this in two hours here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mrs.</v>

1532
01:16:51.450 --> 01:16:52.283
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got.</v>

1533
01:16:52.510 --> 01:16:56.140
<v Speaker 2>You've got to delve into it and you've</v>
<v Speaker 2>also have to put your trust and reliance</v>

1534
01:16:56.141 --> 01:17:00.280
<v Speaker 2>on these experts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have a education professional</v>

1535
01:17:00.281 --> 01:17:04.060
<v Speaker 2>career of 20 to 25 years to come up with</v>
<v Speaker 2>these absolutes.</v>

1536
01:17:04.061 --> 01:17:08.500
<v Speaker 2>There's no one else in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maybe a dozen people that can come</v>

1537
01:17:08.501 --> 01:17:12.590
<v Speaker 2>up with these conclusions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You do have to put your faith in,</v>

1538
01:17:12.670 --> 01:17:16.070
<v Speaker 2>in their background and their careers</v>
<v Speaker 2>and their knowledge and education and</v>

1539
01:17:16.690 --> 01:17:19.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>read those absolutes were that there was</v>

1540
01:17:19.581 --> 01:17:21.560
<v Speaker 2>no evidence of any reinjection.</v>

1541
01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:26.560
<v Speaker 2>This is by multiple experts and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>john would not have retained any</v>

1542
01:17:26.991 --> 01:17:29.450
<v Speaker 2>performance benefit based on these low</v>
<v Speaker 2>level pika.</v>

1543
01:17:29.451 --> 01:17:30.950
<v Speaker 2>Gram amounts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1544
01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:33.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm happy that we were going to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>this out there so people,</v>

1545
01:17:33.891 --> 01:17:36.380
<v Speaker 2>if they have the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they're really that interested in it.</v>

1546
01:17:36.830 --> 01:17:40.240
<v Speaker 2>This is probably a more in depth</v>
<v Speaker 2>discussion of this then you're going to</v>

1547
01:17:40.250 --> 01:17:43.310
<v Speaker 2>get anywhere else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I really wish we could have gotten</v>

1548
01:17:43.311 --> 01:17:46.940
<v Speaker 2>something like this to Nevada and Nevada</v>
<v Speaker 2>could have gone over this and looked at</v>

1549
01:17:46.970 --> 01:17:48.290
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I'm saying,</v>

1550
01:17:48.291 --> 01:17:51.770
<v Speaker 2>what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems to me that we could have just</v>

1551
01:17:51.890 --> 01:17:55.850
<v Speaker 2>had some sort of a meeting and kept his</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight in Nevada and it would have saved</v>

1552
01:17:55.851 --> 01:17:58.070
<v Speaker 2>everybody a lot of heartache.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1553
01:17:58.071 --> 01:18:00.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think things were pointing in</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1554
01:18:00.501 --> 01:18:02.990
<v Speaker 2>but there was no guarantees on that dice</v>
<v Speaker 2>baby.</v>

1555
01:18:02.991 --> 01:18:04.340
<v Speaker 2>It's still come on.</v>

1556
01:18:04.340 --> 01:18:05.690
<v Speaker 2>It's vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>

1557
01:18:05.691 --> 01:18:09.770
<v Speaker 2>The other thing that was being looked at</v>
<v Speaker 2>was was fairness to these athletes.</v>

1558
01:18:09.771 --> 01:18:12.920
<v Speaker 2>Really you're going to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to put john and gus maybe</v>

1559
01:18:12.921 --> 01:18:16.730
<v Speaker 2>more importantly in a position where he</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't know until two days or a day</v>

1560
01:18:16.731 --> 01:18:19.460
<v Speaker 2>before whether this fight is happening</v>
<v Speaker 2>or not.</v>

1561
01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:24.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean these and not even mentioning the</v>
<v Speaker 2>other fighters on the card and look,</v>

1562
01:18:24.770 --> 01:18:28.280
<v Speaker 2>you can talk to and I have to sean and</v>
<v Speaker 2>mick and dana and hunter.</v>

1563
01:18:28.730 --> 01:18:31.310
<v Speaker 2>All these fighters want to be on the big</v>
<v Speaker 2>paper reviews.</v>

1564
01:18:31.820 --> 01:18:34.650
<v Speaker 2>They know the bigger the fight at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>top of the car,</v>

1565
01:18:34.651 --> 01:18:38.510
<v Speaker 2>the more eyes are on that fight and when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a spectacular fight in the</v>

1566
01:18:38.511 --> 01:18:43.100
<v Speaker 2>first second fight on the card,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's on a big pay per view with a</v>

1567
01:18:43.101 --> 01:18:45.680
<v Speaker 2>giant fight at the top of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that can propel your career,</v>

1568
01:18:45.681 --> 01:18:47.810
<v Speaker 2>your next fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could be fighting the main event on</v>

1569
01:18:48.500 --> 01:18:50.180
<v Speaker 2>fight pass and progress from there.</v>

1570
01:18:50.180 --> 01:18:52.280
<v Speaker 2>So I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1571
01:18:52.310 --> 01:18:56.090
<v Speaker 2>I think it's accurate to say that</v>
<v Speaker 2>generally everybody wants these,</v>

1572
01:18:56.150 --> 01:19:00.770
<v Speaker 2>these cards to be as big as possible and</v>
<v Speaker 2>when all the experts are telling us a</v>

1573
01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:04.220
<v Speaker 2>hundred percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this isn't a sanction be he's not</v>

1574
01:19:04.221 --> 01:19:06.410
<v Speaker 2>retaining any performance enhancing</v>
<v Speaker 2>benefits.</v>

1575
01:19:06.411 --> 01:19:08.900
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and clearly dane and hunter thought</v>

1576
01:19:08.901 --> 01:19:11.270
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have an obligation to do what we can</v>

1577
01:19:11.271 --> 01:19:15.020
<v Speaker 2>do for fairness for john.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely for,</v>

1578
01:19:15.050 --> 01:19:17.690
<v Speaker 2>for gus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the rest of the card to try to make</v>

1579
01:19:17.691 --> 01:19:20.840
<v Speaker 2>this fight happen going forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there any way we could ever prevent</v>

1580
01:19:20.841 --> 01:19:24.740
<v Speaker 2>something like this from happening again</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a similar situation in place like</v>

1581
01:19:24.741 --> 01:19:25.970
<v Speaker 2>Nevada?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's.</v>

1582
01:19:26.450 --> 01:19:29.660
<v Speaker 2>I think we have a couple solutions to</v>
<v Speaker 2>that and it's not necessarily relative</v>

1583
01:19:29.661 --> 01:19:32.990
<v Speaker 2>to the commission,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one thing that obviously protected</v>

1584
01:19:33.110 --> 01:19:35.780
<v Speaker 2>john a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this was the frequency of testing.</v>

1585
01:19:36.290 --> 01:19:40.370
<v Speaker 2>If you look at his numbers and these</v>
<v Speaker 2>were these were instances where they</v>

1586
01:19:40.371 --> 01:19:42.860
<v Speaker 2>collected samples,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in many of these cases they did</v>

1587
01:19:42.861 --> 01:19:45.430
<v Speaker 2>multiple tests on him and that means you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1588
01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:48.500
<v Speaker 2>the tests I'm reading were for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>anabolic steroid panel,</v>

1589
01:19:48.860 --> 01:19:51.410
<v Speaker 2>but in addition to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they may have done the biological</v>

1590
01:19:51.411 --> 01:19:55.610
<v Speaker 2>passport tests on that same collection</v>
<v Speaker 2>that may have done in hgh test and epo</v>

1591
01:19:55.611 --> 01:19:57.870
<v Speaker 2>test and this is all confidential that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you sought.</v>

1592
01:19:57.880 --> 01:20:00.650
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't release all this information</v>
<v Speaker 2>with these numbers on the publicly</v>

1593
01:20:00.651 --> 01:20:03.920
<v Speaker 2>available website that you don't see</v>
<v Speaker 2>what those tests are done.</v>

1594
01:20:03.921 --> 01:20:06.650
<v Speaker 2>So the reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they just told me this is john was</v>

1595
01:20:06.680 --> 01:20:09.450
<v Speaker 2>one of the most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if not the most tested athlete over</v>

1596
01:20:09.451 --> 01:20:12.840
<v Speaker 2>these last six months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you look at total amount of tests</v>

1597
01:20:13.410 --> 01:20:14.700
<v Speaker 2>on samples,</v>
<v Speaker 2>excuse me.</v>

1598
01:20:15.870 --> 01:20:19.590
<v Speaker 2>One thing that obviously protecting them</v>
<v Speaker 2>here was that volume of testing.</v>

1599
01:20:19.620 --> 01:20:22.160
<v Speaker 2>And so you saw to came to us and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1600
01:20:22.170 --> 01:20:24.750
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we think that you probably should,</v>

1601
01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:27.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>up the amount of tests that you're</v>

1602
01:20:27.181 --> 01:20:28.020
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1603
01:20:28.590 --> 01:20:31.800
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just renewed a contract with usada</v>

1604
01:20:31.801 --> 01:20:34.350
<v Speaker 2>and reduced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're increasing our testing numbers by</v>

1605
01:20:34.351 --> 01:20:36.680
<v Speaker 2>30 to 40 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We currently,</v>

1606
01:20:36.980 --> 01:20:38.850
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first three years of the program</v>

1607
01:20:38.851 --> 01:20:43.851
<v Speaker 2>were under contract for approximately</v>
<v Speaker 2>2,700 tests and starting this next year</v>

1608
01:20:44.221 --> 01:20:47.160
<v Speaker 2>we're going to up that to around 43,</v>
<v Speaker 2>4,400 tests.</v>

1609
01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:50.700
<v Speaker 2>So I think there going to be more of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>burden they're going to be,</v>

1610
01:20:50.820 --> 01:20:53.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you saw to showing up in more doorsteps</v>

1611
01:20:53.221 --> 01:20:55.200
<v Speaker 2>early in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have more of our athletes.</v>

1612
01:20:55.201 --> 01:20:57.300
<v Speaker 2>But I think this is a perfect example</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1613
01:20:57.301 --> 01:21:01.140
<v Speaker 2>that increased volume of testing</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually can be a protectant to the</v>

1614
01:21:01.141 --> 01:21:02.910
<v Speaker 2>athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when you talk in these low</v>

1615
01:21:02.911 --> 01:21:07.170
<v Speaker 2>level pika gram quantities and</v>
<v Speaker 2>contaminated cases and things like that.</v>

1616
01:21:07.470 --> 01:21:10.780
<v Speaker 2>We just got to get athletes to stopped</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking any supplement.</v>

1617
01:21:10.781 --> 01:21:12.730
<v Speaker 2>It's not third party tested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great point.</v>

1618
01:21:12.731 --> 01:21:17.340
<v Speaker 2>So here's what we've done in that area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So about three months ago you saw a</v>

1619
01:21:17.341 --> 01:21:20.400
<v Speaker 2>hosted a working group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It included the ufc,</v>

1620
01:21:20.490 --> 01:21:23.790
<v Speaker 2>myself and our nutritionist clinton</v>
<v Speaker 2>wattenberg,</v>

1621
01:21:23.791 --> 01:21:26.550
<v Speaker 2>who you've met,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were there major majorly baseball,</v>

1622
01:21:26.551 --> 01:21:29.670
<v Speaker 2>was there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the department of defense was there,</v>

1623
01:21:29.700 --> 01:21:34.700
<v Speaker 2>there's been war fighters who have</v>
<v Speaker 2>purchased supplements at bases over in</v>

1624
01:21:34.921 --> 01:21:38.550
<v Speaker 2>Iraq and Afghanistan that contain</v>
<v Speaker 2>ephedrine and other bad products.</v>

1625
01:21:38.550 --> 01:21:42.030
<v Speaker 2>Some of them potentially have died as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>result of ingesting them,</v>

1626
01:21:42.031 --> 01:21:46.050
<v Speaker 2>so they definitely have an interest in</v>
<v Speaker 2>safety and dietary supplements and you</v>

1627
01:21:46.051 --> 01:21:50.370
<v Speaker 2>saw it as experts were there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we did is we invited in the major</v>

1628
01:21:50.371 --> 01:21:55.140
<v Speaker 2>third party certification companies and</v>
<v Speaker 2>each one took a half day presenting what</v>

1629
01:21:55.141 --> 01:21:59.070
<v Speaker 2>their programs look like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We went back and huddled after each one</v>

1630
01:21:59.071 --> 01:22:03.540
<v Speaker 2>and huddled at the conclusion and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is a platinum standard third party</v>

1631
01:22:03.541 --> 01:22:06.780
<v Speaker 2>certification look like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's all these presentations we got</v>

1632
01:22:07.170 --> 01:22:11.220
<v Speaker 2>what was and one's weaknesses and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>others and we have to put a perfect one</v>

1633
01:22:11.221 --> 01:22:12.060
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was it?</v>

1634
01:22:12.210 --> 01:22:15.810
<v Speaker 2>What does it look like over the last</v>
<v Speaker 2>month we've been offering,</v>

1635
01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:18.030
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a paper that's going to be published in</v>

1636
01:22:18.031 --> 01:22:22.560
<v Speaker 2>a scientific journal going over with</v>
<v Speaker 2>that gold standard platinum standard.</v>

1637
01:22:22.561 --> 01:22:27.561
<v Speaker 2>Looks like I'm going forward any third</v>
<v Speaker 2>party certification company that can</v>

1638
01:22:28.381 --> 01:22:30.300
<v Speaker 2>meet that and there's some that are very</v>
<v Speaker 2>close.</v>

1639
01:22:30.300 --> 01:22:32.040
<v Speaker 2>I think we'll be able to do it very</v>
<v Speaker 2>quickly.</v>

1640
01:22:32.580 --> 01:22:36.220
<v Speaker 2>We are going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you saw it is going to say this is an</v>

1641
01:22:36.221 --> 01:22:40.730
<v Speaker 2>approved line of supplements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We approve you to take this and this is</v>

1642
01:22:40.731 --> 01:22:43.410
<v Speaker 2>something that we've been unable to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the first three and a half years of</v>

1643
01:22:43.411 --> 01:22:46.770
<v Speaker 2>the program and I tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>joe is the most common question I get</v>

1644
01:22:46.771 --> 01:22:50.130
<v Speaker 2>from our athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's you sought approved and as soon</v>

1645
01:22:50.131 --> 01:22:53.310
<v Speaker 2>as I say you doesn't approve any</v>
<v Speaker 2>supplements,</v>

1646
01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:57.300
<v Speaker 2>but here's how you ensure your safety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They stop listening.</v>

1647
01:22:57.360 --> 01:23:02.160
<v Speaker 2>Goes in one ear out the other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a silly suggestion,</v>

1648
01:23:02.190 --> 01:23:06.970
<v Speaker 2>but why doesn't the ufc come up with its</v>
<v Speaker 2>own supplement and provide them to the</v>

1649
01:23:06.971 --> 01:23:09.280
<v Speaker 2>fighters and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't take anything else.</v>

1650
01:23:09.420 --> 01:23:11.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it is after they've been through.</v>

1651
01:23:11.741 --> 01:23:14.330
<v Speaker 2>It's had sponsorships with other</v>
<v Speaker 2>supplement line.</v>

1652
01:23:14.340 --> 01:23:16.270
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of dynamics to it.</v>

1653
01:23:16.270 --> 01:23:20.530
<v Speaker 2>It's not as easy as doing it overnight</v>
<v Speaker 2>and distillation method.</v>

1654
01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:22.240
<v Speaker 2>Just if you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1655
01:23:22.300 --> 01:23:24.130
<v Speaker 2>you can take creatine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could take,</v>

1656
01:23:24.131 --> 01:23:26.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the multivitamins,</v>

1657
01:23:26.141 --> 01:23:29.950
<v Speaker 2>you could take a branch chain amino</v>
<v Speaker 2>acids and all these things that have</v>

1658
01:23:29.951 --> 01:23:32.830
<v Speaker 2>been proven to be effective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's weird too.</v>

1659
01:23:32.831 --> 01:23:34.450
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like they're effective.</v>

1660
01:23:34.451 --> 01:23:36.310
<v Speaker 2>Meaning they enhanced performance and</v>
<v Speaker 2>recovery,</v>

1661
01:23:36.580 --> 01:23:39.940
<v Speaker 2>but they don't do enough to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>considered a performance enhancing drug.</v>

1662
01:23:40.030 --> 01:23:41.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And their president in the food supply.</v>

1663
01:23:41.980 --> 01:23:46.480
<v Speaker 2>So like basically out of community you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can go eat 10 chicken breasts or you</v>

1664
01:23:46.481 --> 01:23:48.940
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a couple of scoops of protein if</v>

1665
01:23:48.941 --> 01:23:50.650
<v Speaker 2>you're on the go and don't have time to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>

1666
01:23:50.651 --> 01:23:53.080
<v Speaker 2>So I think again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>apples and oranges in terms of</v>

1667
01:23:53.380 --> 01:23:56.290
<v Speaker 2>performance enhancing or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1668
01:23:56.291 --> 01:23:58.720
<v Speaker 2>so the theory would be we have an</v>
<v Speaker 2>approved when,</v>

1669
01:23:58.750 --> 01:24:01.660
<v Speaker 2>when I'm or dawn or asked that question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's approved,</v>

1670
01:24:01.690 --> 01:24:06.610
<v Speaker 2>I can say here's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say nsf nsf has 1200 supplements</v>

1671
01:24:06.611 --> 01:24:07.090
<v Speaker 2>that are approved.</v>

1672
01:24:07.090 --> 01:24:10.570
<v Speaker 2>I'd say all 1200 of these or approved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should only use these.</v>

1673
01:24:10.630 --> 01:24:14.740
<v Speaker 2>If something were to happen to an</v>
<v Speaker 2>athlete that used and approved line of</v>

1674
01:24:14.741 --> 01:24:16.810
<v Speaker 2>supplements to get out of jail free</v>
<v Speaker 2>card.</v>

1675
01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:19.030
<v Speaker 2>If they can prove it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you saw it independently,</v>

1676
01:24:19.031 --> 01:24:20.350
<v Speaker 2>prove it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no sanction.</v>

1677
01:24:20.351 --> 01:24:23.890
<v Speaker 2>I think that is going to go a long way</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'll give you a reason for that.</v>

1678
01:24:23.950 --> 01:24:27.520
<v Speaker 2>Major league baseball does that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have for the last couple of years</v>

1679
01:24:27.700 --> 01:24:31.990
<v Speaker 2>now they have some advantage and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>all their athletes are employees and are</v>

1680
01:24:31.991 --> 01:24:35.230
<v Speaker 2>coming into the same facility for during</v>
<v Speaker 2>the season.</v>

1681
01:24:35.231 --> 01:24:37.630
<v Speaker 2>So they have some control over there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well we don't.</v>

1682
01:24:38.050 --> 01:24:41.620
<v Speaker 2>Our athletes are spread amongst 46</v>
<v Speaker 2>countries throughout the world,</v>

1683
01:24:41.621 --> 01:24:45.670
<v Speaker 2>so it's more of a challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But baseball's said the only supplements</v>

1684
01:24:45.671 --> 01:24:49.520
<v Speaker 2>we're allowing in the clubhouse or in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>facility are.</v>

1685
01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:53.530
<v Speaker 2>They use nsf supplements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had zero contaminated supplement</v>

1686
01:24:53.531 --> 01:24:57.220
<v Speaker 2>cases last year they had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're testing numbers were</v>

1687
01:24:57.221 --> 01:25:00.910
<v Speaker 2>four times the amount of our testing</v>
<v Speaker 2>numbers and zero contaminated</v>

1688
01:25:00.911 --> 01:25:01.480
<v Speaker 2>supplements.</v>

1689
01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:03.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean the proof's in the pudding right</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1690
01:25:03.370 --> 01:25:07.570
<v Speaker 2>So they had worked with deal with nsf.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's a deal other than</v>

1691
01:25:07.571 --> 01:25:11.720
<v Speaker 2>they've examined who those certification</v>
<v Speaker 2>companies are and they feel that they're</v>

1692
01:25:12.010 --> 01:25:15.910
<v Speaker 2>at the top of the line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't want to exclude any.</v>

1693
01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.670
<v Speaker 2>And that's why we're contributing to</v>
<v Speaker 2>this paper to say,</v>

1694
01:25:18.671 --> 01:25:20.800
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone could be one of these approved</v>

1695
01:25:20.801 --> 01:25:23.200
<v Speaker 2>lines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you must meet this criteria for</v>

1696
01:25:23.201 --> 01:25:25.960
<v Speaker 2>platinum standard program,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's coming from someone who's in a</v>

1697
01:25:25.961 --> 01:25:27.730
<v Speaker 2>supplement business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me,</v>

1698
01:25:27.790 --> 01:25:30.310
<v Speaker 2>that's the wild west out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boy is it.</v>

1699
01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:34.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of shit out there that's</v>

1700
01:25:34.451 --> 01:25:38.320
<v Speaker 2>just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They purposely add performance enhancing</v>

1701
01:25:38.321 --> 01:25:42.370
<v Speaker 2>drugs to their stuff because it's cheap</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people take it.</v>

1702
01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:45.760
<v Speaker 2>They experience these gains and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>they sell a lot of it and then you get a</v>

1703
01:25:45.761 --> 01:25:46.630
<v Speaker 2>following.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1704
01:25:46.631 --> 01:25:50.890
<v Speaker 2>I saw that when I was with the fda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is what they normally will do for</v>

1705
01:25:50.891 --> 01:25:52.750
<v Speaker 2>maybe the first six months of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>product.</v>

1706
01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:56.170
<v Speaker 2>They'll spike it with something if</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going that route and then to</v>

1707
01:25:56.171 --> 01:25:59.080
<v Speaker 2>decrease liability thereafter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've already got the following,</v>

1708
01:25:59.590 --> 01:26:03.260
<v Speaker 2>stuff's working like like hell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they back off just in the</v>

1709
01:26:03.261 --> 01:26:05.150
<v Speaker 2>government and it doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people go,</v>

1710
01:26:05.151 --> 01:26:10.151
<v Speaker 2>oh my body must have adapted exactly</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

1711
01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:14.870
<v Speaker 2>It's really such a shame because this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>such a fantastic fight.</v>

1712
01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:18.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's so much drama involved</v>
<v Speaker 2>already.</v>

1713
01:26:18.291 --> 01:26:22.790
<v Speaker 2>Just having John Jones returning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having alexander gustafson looking</v>

1714
01:26:22.791 --> 01:26:27.740
<v Speaker 2>absolutely sensational in his last fight</v>
<v Speaker 2>with glover to sharer all the trash talk</v>

1715
01:26:27.741 --> 01:26:31.790
<v Speaker 2>and hype and intensity in the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is really other than dc versus</v>

1716
01:26:31.791 --> 01:26:33.590
<v Speaker 2>john.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the fight that people want to</v>

1717
01:26:33.591 --> 01:26:35.690
<v Speaker 2>see in the light heavyweight division,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and look,</v>

1718
01:26:35.720 --> 01:26:38.480
<v Speaker 2>nobody's saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm certainly not saying that john</v>

1719
01:26:38.570 --> 01:26:41.120
<v Speaker 2>didn't do anything wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He obviously did.</v>

1720
01:26:41.210 --> 01:26:46.210
<v Speaker 2>John has two times now tested positive</v>
<v Speaker 2>for prohibited substance,</v>

1721
01:26:46.670 --> 01:26:49.700
<v Speaker 2>says however,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in both occasions,</v>

1722
01:26:49.701 --> 01:26:53.240
<v Speaker 2>arbitrators have determined that it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>not done intentionally.</v>

1723
01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:55.460
<v Speaker 2>So anyone who says that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1724
01:26:55.461 --> 01:26:58.580
<v Speaker 2>john's getting off light on this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's been suspended for almost two and a</v>

1725
01:26:58.581 --> 01:27:03.530
<v Speaker 2>half years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for lack with a lack of evidence of any</v>

1726
01:27:03.590 --> 01:27:07.670
<v Speaker 2>intentional use are cheating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know how much money he's probably</v>

1727
01:27:07.671 --> 01:27:11.750
<v Speaker 2>lost in those two and a half years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many tens of millions of dollars</v>

1728
01:27:11.751 --> 01:27:14.990
<v Speaker 2>doesn't reputation?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anybody who says that he got off scot</v>

1729
01:27:14.991 --> 01:27:18.380
<v Speaker 2>free on this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would argue the otherwise he was held</v>

1730
01:27:18.381 --> 01:27:21.230
<v Speaker 2>to the strictest of liability standards</v>
<v Speaker 2>out there.</v>

1731
01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:24.320
<v Speaker 2>Someone at the top of their game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>money earning potential like him.</v>

1732
01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:27.680
<v Speaker 2>There's also an incredible amount of</v>
<v Speaker 2>stress and,</v>

1733
01:27:27.700 --> 01:27:31.610
<v Speaker 2>and it's on him just a human being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he feels and he hears what people are</v>

1734
01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:34.670
<v Speaker 2>saying about them and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's got to be very difficult also,</v>

1735
01:27:34.671 --> 01:27:36.980
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming off of this massive suspension.</v>

1736
01:27:37.250 --> 01:27:39.470
<v Speaker 2>So he's coming off of the suspension,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was huge,</v>

1737
01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:43.150
<v Speaker 2>very public,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very worldwide after the cocaine,</v>

1738
01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:44.410
<v Speaker 2>the car accident,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1739
01:27:44.420 --> 01:27:47.720
<v Speaker 2>the previous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dick pills that had the stuff and I</v>

1740
01:27:47.721 --> 01:27:49.610
<v Speaker 2>mean this is so many things.</v>

1741
01:27:49.790 --> 01:27:53.720
<v Speaker 2>And then to have this happen literally</v>
<v Speaker 2>the week of and have the fight moved to</v>

1742
01:27:53.721 --> 01:27:55.670
<v Speaker 2>California.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1743
01:27:55.760 --> 01:27:57.770
<v Speaker 2>and I get the skepticism that's out</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1744
01:27:57.830 --> 01:27:59.930
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>without delving into this,</v>

1745
01:27:59.931 --> 01:28:04.550
<v Speaker 2>I've spent hours and hours and these</v>
<v Speaker 2>experts have spent their careers looking</v>

1746
01:28:04.551 --> 01:28:06.830
<v Speaker 2>into that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's really what's required to get a</v>

1747
01:28:06.831 --> 01:28:09.860
<v Speaker 2>comprehension and understanding of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1748
01:28:10.580 --> 01:28:11.840
<v Speaker 2>another thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another argument,</v>

1749
01:28:11.841 --> 01:28:14.900
<v Speaker 2>john's being treated specially because</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's john,</v>

1750
01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:19.790
<v Speaker 2>but we had another athlete that this</v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhat identical thing happened too,</v>

1751
01:28:19.791 --> 01:28:23.510
<v Speaker 2>but nowhere near at the level of john.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a kid by the name of grant dawson.</v>

1752
01:28:24.110 --> 01:28:28.520
<v Speaker 2>So grant dawson last summer was in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>data white contender series,</v>

1753
01:28:29.210 --> 01:28:31.070
<v Speaker 2>had an awesome fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dane is like,</v>

1754
01:28:31.071 --> 01:28:33.250
<v Speaker 2>you've got a contract kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1755
01:28:33.620 --> 01:28:35.580
<v Speaker 2>we get them into the usada program that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1756
01:28:35.581 --> 01:28:40.160
<v Speaker 2>you solder quote program requires you to</v>
<v Speaker 2>disclose everything you've used going</v>

1757
01:28:40.161 --> 01:28:43.370
<v Speaker 2>back 12 months or one year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea being,</v>

1758
01:28:43.371 --> 01:28:45.440
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though you weren't under the</v>

1759
01:28:45.441 --> 01:28:47.210
<v Speaker 2>program,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you've used,</v>

1760
01:28:47.340 --> 01:28:49.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oral terenna ball eight or nine months</v>

1761
01:28:49.821 --> 01:28:52.510
<v Speaker 2>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there could still be an advantage that</v>

1762
01:28:52.511 --> 01:28:53.740
<v Speaker 2>you'd be getting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1763
01:28:53.750 --> 01:28:56.750
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to necessarily suspend</v>
<v Speaker 2>you because you weren't subject to the</v>

1764
01:28:56.751 --> 01:28:58.480
<v Speaker 2>program then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're not going to let you fight.</v>

1765
01:28:58.490 --> 01:29:00.230
<v Speaker 2>All right away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're gonna have to be in the program</v>

1766
01:29:00.231 --> 01:29:02.190
<v Speaker 2>for a certain amount of time testing</v>
<v Speaker 2>clean.</v>

1767
01:29:02.970 --> 01:29:05.550
<v Speaker 2>So he didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he didn't disclose that he was using</v>

1768
01:29:05.551 --> 01:29:06.960
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His first test,</v>

1769
01:29:06.961 --> 01:29:10.770
<v Speaker 2>he tests positive for m,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three metabolite low levels.</v>

1770
01:29:11.640 --> 01:29:14.220
<v Speaker 2>He goes to arbitration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>argues,</v>

1771
01:29:14.221 --> 01:29:16.830
<v Speaker 2>testifies under oath.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never heard of this substance.</v>

1772
01:29:16.831 --> 01:29:19.500
<v Speaker 2>I've never taken it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would never cheat.</v>

1773
01:29:19.530 --> 01:29:21.060
<v Speaker 2>Here are all the supplements I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>using.</v>

1774
01:29:21.061 --> 01:29:23.580
<v Speaker 2>I can't find it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The arbitrator.</v>

1775
01:29:23.610 --> 01:29:25.950
<v Speaker 2>Here's the hearing you saw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It goes to them and says,</v>

1776
01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:28.980
<v Speaker 2>hold on a second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're looking into this matter talking</v>

1777
01:29:28.981 --> 01:29:32.010
<v Speaker 2>to baseball,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever you sorta comes out that,</v>

1778
01:29:32.011 --> 01:29:34.730
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can't prove that this didn't enter</v>

1779
01:29:34.731 --> 01:29:39.330
<v Speaker 2>his substance a year before that</v>
<v Speaker 2>disclosure required him to disclose what</v>

1780
01:29:39.331 --> 01:29:42.490
<v Speaker 2>he was using,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he was basically lead often an</v>

1781
01:29:42.510 --> 01:29:46.830
<v Speaker 2>eligible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so john's not the only person in the ufc</v>

1782
01:29:46.860 --> 01:29:50.340
<v Speaker 2>that this has happened to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not not withstanding other professional</v>

1783
01:29:50.341 --> 01:29:51.900
<v Speaker 2>sports leagues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other olympics.</v>

1784
01:29:51.901 --> 01:29:55.290
<v Speaker 2>It's happened to other athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not the only one.</v>

1785
01:29:56.630 --> 01:30:01.370
<v Speaker 3>So I think what's important for people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get the skepticism,</v>

1786
01:30:01.640 --> 01:30:06.260
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's very important that</v>
<v Speaker 3>people don't accuse someone of something</v>

1787
01:30:06.261 --> 01:30:09.950
<v Speaker 3>that they didn't do and I want you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're listening to this,</v>

1788
01:30:10.040 --> 01:30:14.600
<v Speaker 3>I want you to imagine if you're John</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jones and you trying to get your shit</v>

1789
01:30:14.601 --> 01:30:18.080
<v Speaker 3>together and you didn't do anything new,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he didn't do anything different.</v>

1790
01:30:18.560 --> 01:30:22.340
<v Speaker 3>We've got to have a path of redemption</v>
<v Speaker 3>for people.</v>

1791
01:30:22.360 --> 01:30:23.330
<v Speaker 3>You've got.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to.</v>

1792
01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:26.570
<v Speaker 3>And if john,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you're saying,</v>

1793
01:30:26.630 --> 01:30:30.350
<v Speaker 3>and all of these tests conclude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if he didn't do anything,</v>

1794
01:30:30.890 --> 01:30:32.810
<v Speaker 3>folks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got to stop saying he's cheating.</v>

1795
01:30:32.840 --> 01:30:35.660
<v Speaker 3>You got.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not cheating if he's not cheating</v>

1796
01:30:35.661 --> 01:30:39.500
<v Speaker 3>and if it's showing that these are these</v>
<v Speaker 3>longterm residual metabolites that are</v>

1797
01:30:39.501 --> 01:30:44.060
<v Speaker 3>an incredibly small dosage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's there's a real cheaters out there</v>

1798
01:30:44.061 --> 01:30:47.420
<v Speaker 3>and john's fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has fucked up and you were all right</v>

1799
01:30:47.421 --> 01:30:48.950
<v Speaker 3>to be upset at him when he fucked up.</v>

1800
01:30:49.220 --> 01:30:53.000
<v Speaker 3>This is not his leases.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My conclusion after talking to you and</v>

1801
01:30:53.340 --> 01:30:55.370
<v Speaker 3>and and I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've talked to some independent</v>

1802
01:30:55.371 --> 01:30:57.860
<v Speaker 3>scientists that were skeptical about</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of the aspects of it,</v>

1803
01:30:58.160 --> 01:31:02.020
<v Speaker 3>but they're also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're skeptical because they're not up</v>

1804
01:31:02.021 --> 01:31:07.021
<v Speaker 3>to date perhaps on the differences in</v>
<v Speaker 3>this pulsing effect or the fact that</v>

1805
01:31:08.630 --> 01:31:13.230
<v Speaker 3>this is something that is relatively.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's not a lot of,</v>

1806
01:31:14.160 --> 01:31:17.630
<v Speaker 3>a lot of documentation on this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is something that's</v>

1807
01:31:17.631 --> 01:31:21.620
<v Speaker 3>relatively new in terms of our ability</v>
<v Speaker 3>to understand pika grams.</v>

1808
01:31:21.770 --> 01:31:24.380
<v Speaker 3>Our ability to understand this pulsing</v>
<v Speaker 3>affect all these different,</v>

1809
01:31:24.590 --> 01:31:27.890
<v Speaker 3>these variables that you have to take</v>
<v Speaker 3>into account when it comes to this.</v>

1810
01:31:28.100 --> 01:31:30.800
<v Speaker 3>People love to call cheat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They love to and it's good.</v>

1811
01:31:30.830 --> 01:31:33.170
<v Speaker 3>It's good that the people were out there</v>
<v Speaker 3>keeping people honest,</v>

1812
01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:37.610
<v Speaker 3>but I think you gotta we gotta look at</v>
<v Speaker 3>this the right way and I think the right</v>

1813
01:31:37.611 --> 01:31:39.950
<v Speaker 3>way is what you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way you're laying it out here,</v>

1814
01:31:39.951 --> 01:31:40.784
<v Speaker 3>I don't see any holes,</v>

1815
01:31:41.250 --> 01:31:44.910
<v Speaker 2>so a couple things in the future that</v>
<v Speaker 2>people can look forward to.</v>

1816
01:31:44.911 --> 01:31:47.450
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we want and john wants to fight in</v>

1817
01:31:47.460 --> 01:31:50.100
<v Speaker 2>Nevada and Nevada is basically said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1818
01:31:50.101 --> 01:31:52.410
<v Speaker 2>I think we understand this issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we need to have this hearing.</v>

1819
01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:56.460
<v Speaker 2>There will be a public hearing on this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My understanding is early quarter one,</v>

1820
01:31:56.461 --> 01:31:58.290
<v Speaker 2>so look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1821
01:31:58.410 --> 01:32:00.190
<v Speaker 2>don't take word for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wait until</v>

1822
01:32:00.190 --> 01:32:02.080
<v Speaker 3>january.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure they'll call some of these</v>

1823
01:32:02.081 --> 01:32:05.840
<v Speaker 3>experts to testify.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Introduce some of these documents into</v>

1824
01:32:05.890 --> 01:32:08.500
<v Speaker 3>the public record longer even than this</v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation.</v>

1825
01:32:08.560 --> 01:32:10.000
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be my guess.</v>

1826
01:32:10.030 --> 01:32:11.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1827
01:32:11.470 --> 01:32:13.080
<v Speaker 3>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's,</v>

1828
01:32:13.130 --> 01:32:16.420
<v Speaker 3>that's to come.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The whole thing is such a disaster for</v>

1829
01:32:16.421 --> 01:32:20.110
<v Speaker 3>everybody else on the card for Amanda</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nunez and cris cyborg and for all the</v>

1830
01:32:20.111 --> 01:32:21.450
<v Speaker 3>people on the undercard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1831
01:32:21.451 --> 01:32:26.290
<v Speaker 3>it's just to have them to move all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>way to California when I'm happy about</v>

1832
01:32:26.291 --> 01:32:29.740
<v Speaker 3>those that the fight is still happening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm very happy to fight is still</v>

1833
01:32:29.741 --> 01:32:31.020
<v Speaker 3>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am.</v>

1834
01:32:31.021 --> 01:32:33.910
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to take an objective look about</v>

1835
01:32:34.070 --> 01:32:38.830
<v Speaker 3>is this fair as it relates to how our</v>
<v Speaker 3>policy and what the rules are and you</v>

1836
01:32:38.831 --> 01:32:39.850
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you have,</v>

1837
01:32:40.360 --> 01:32:42.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the experts in the world,</v>

1838
01:32:42.791 --> 01:32:46.390
<v Speaker 3>Dr. Daniel lackner,</v>
<v Speaker 3>other myrtle laboratory issue an</v>

1839
01:32:46.391 --> 01:32:51.220
<v Speaker 3>absolute statement like there is no</v>
<v Speaker 3>evidence that dh cmt has been</v>

1840
01:32:51.221 --> 01:32:55.120
<v Speaker 3>readministered and that based on these</v>
<v Speaker 3>low levels,</v>

1841
01:32:55.420 --> 01:32:58.210
<v Speaker 3>he does not retaining a performance</v>
<v Speaker 3>enhancing benefit.</v>

1842
01:32:58.600 --> 01:33:01.180
<v Speaker 3>How out of fairness and implementing the</v>
<v Speaker 3>program,</v>

1843
01:33:01.181 --> 01:33:03.820
<v Speaker 3>do you prevent this from happening?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't do that.</v>

1844
01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:08.020
<v Speaker 3>It would be categorically unfair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1845
01:33:08.110 --> 01:33:12.730
<v Speaker 3>moving forward from here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what changes and what do we do to stop</v>

1846
01:33:12.731 --> 01:33:14.320
<v Speaker 3>something like this from happening</v>
<v Speaker 3>again?</v>

1847
01:33:14.321 --> 01:33:16.720
<v Speaker 3>I think the increased volume of testing</v>
<v Speaker 3>is going to help.</v>

1848
01:33:17.230 --> 01:33:22.230
<v Speaker 3>I think being able to specifically</v>
<v Speaker 3>direct our athletes to approve line of</v>

1849
01:33:22.301 --> 01:33:25.070
<v Speaker 3>supplements will help.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1850
01:33:25.150 --> 01:33:26.140
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1851
01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:29.860
<v Speaker 3>we can don and I can message the hell</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of these things.</v>

1852
01:33:29.861 --> 01:33:31.110
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1853
01:33:31.230 --> 01:33:31.960
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1854
01:33:31.960 --> 01:33:34.960
<v Speaker 3>it takes the athletes and their camps to</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen to what we're saying.</v>

1855
01:33:34.961 --> 01:33:36.760
<v Speaker 3>So I mean if anything good comes out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1856
01:33:36.761 --> 01:33:41.650
<v Speaker 3>hopefully it's a warning to those other</v>
<v Speaker 3>others out there about how careful you</v>

1857
01:33:41.651 --> 01:33:45.250
<v Speaker 3>need to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So just to wrap this up so people</v>

1858
01:33:45.251 --> 01:33:48.010
<v Speaker 3>understand if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you want to put a button on this,</v>

1859
01:33:48.310 --> 01:33:50.940
<v Speaker 3>there is no evidence whatsoever of any</v>
<v Speaker 3>microdosing.</v>

1860
01:33:51.160 --> 01:33:54.520
<v Speaker 3>So this is one of the concerns people</v>
<v Speaker 3>were worried about microdosing no</v>

1861
01:33:54.521 --> 01:33:57.370
<v Speaker 3>evidence whatsoever of microdosing</v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't be a substance.</v>

1862
01:33:57.371 --> 01:34:00.580
<v Speaker 3>You were generally microdose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You do endogenous substances,</v>

1863
01:34:00.581 --> 01:34:05.380
<v Speaker 3>not exotic enough is also no evidence of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the short term and medium term.</v>

1864
01:34:05.460 --> 01:34:07.960
<v Speaker 3>A medium,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a medium term.</v>

1865
01:34:08.020 --> 01:34:11.590
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Metabolites that were recognized by</v>

1866
01:34:11.591 --> 01:34:13.630
<v Speaker 3>virtue of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say his name again.</v>

1867
01:34:13.660 --> 01:34:18.460
<v Speaker 3>I think it is gregory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a tough time with Gregory Gregory</v>

1868
01:34:18.560 --> 01:34:19.393
<v Speaker 3>caligari.</v>

1869
01:34:21.190 --> 01:34:24.430
<v Speaker 3>That's the only test we have no parent</v>
<v Speaker 3>compound ever found as well.</v>

1870
01:34:24.730 --> 01:34:28.570
<v Speaker 3>These are these the only tests we have</v>
<v Speaker 3>that show these longterm short term and</v>

1871
01:34:28.571 --> 01:34:30.800
<v Speaker 3>medium term metabolites.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These,</v>

1872
01:34:30.830 --> 01:34:35.350
<v Speaker 3>the short term in the medium term ones</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be indicative of him taking</v>

1873
01:34:35.351 --> 01:34:39.310
<v Speaker 3>it recently don't exist at any point in</v>
<v Speaker 3>time during these testing.</v>

1874
01:34:39.330 --> 01:34:42.460
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is most likely something that is</v>

1875
01:34:43.150 --> 01:34:46.540
<v Speaker 3>inside of his body that is an incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 3>small levels.</v>

1876
01:34:46.870 --> 01:34:51.870
<v Speaker 3>And is it safe to say that the detection</v>
<v Speaker 3>levels that the detection methods are</v>

1877
01:34:53.650 --> 01:34:56.590
<v Speaker 3>far superior today than they were a year</v>
<v Speaker 3>ago,</v>

1878
01:34:56.650 --> 01:34:58.250
<v Speaker 3>two years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three years ago,</v>

1879
01:34:58.400 --> 01:35:01.190
<v Speaker 2>increase by thousands of percentage</v>
<v Speaker 2>points,</v>

1880
01:35:01.480 --> 01:35:03.290
<v Speaker 2>insensitivity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean again,</v>

1881
01:35:03.380 --> 01:35:06.110
<v Speaker 2>and how recently over the last five</v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

1882
01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:11.560
<v Speaker 2>And how recently have they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they improved from today versus a</v>

1883
01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:12.021
<v Speaker 2>year ago?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1884
01:35:12.021 --> 01:35:13.550
<v Speaker 2>I believe so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

1885
01:35:13.551 --> 01:35:15.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I heard about the one pika gram</v>

1886
01:35:15.531 --> 01:35:17.860
<v Speaker 2>detection of the n three metabolite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1887
01:35:17.870 --> 01:35:19.370
<v Speaker 2>that was something that happened this</v>
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>

1888
01:35:19.371 --> 01:35:24.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm not aware of that ever being that</v>
<v Speaker 2>low of a number in any time in the past.</v>

1889
01:35:24.021 --> 01:35:25.480
<v Speaker 2>So I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1890
01:35:25.490 --> 01:35:28.970
<v Speaker 2>literally week by week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>month by month as we're going here,</v>

1891
01:35:29.270 --> 01:35:32.590
<v Speaker 2>that level of sensitivity is increasing</v>
<v Speaker 2>exponentially.</v>

1892
01:35:32.900 --> 01:35:37.490
<v Speaker 2>No possible performance enhancing</v>
<v Speaker 2>benefits from these incredibly low</v>

1893
01:35:37.491 --> 01:35:39.860
<v Speaker 2>levels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what the experts are telling me.</v>

1894
01:35:39.950 --> 01:35:40.820
<v Speaker 2>Look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

1895
01:35:40.821 --> 01:35:43.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm not the expert,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to profess that I am,</v>

1896
01:35:43.791 --> 01:35:46.070
<v Speaker 2>but what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do I have to go to?</v>

1897
01:35:46.071 --> 01:35:49.730
<v Speaker 2>I need to go to those experts that have</v>
<v Speaker 2>made careers out of studying these</v>

1898
01:35:49.731 --> 01:35:53.900
<v Speaker 2>substances and the benefits and they are</v>
<v Speaker 2>all universally telling me that there's</v>

1899
01:35:53.901 --> 01:35:55.400
<v Speaker 2>no performance enhancing benefit.</v>

1900
01:35:55.580 --> 01:36:00.580
<v Speaker 2>Full compliance by jon jones in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 2>being there for usada at every single</v>

1901
01:36:00.711 --> 01:36:03.590
<v Speaker 2>test.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A notifying his whereabouts,</v>

1902
01:36:03.591 --> 01:36:06.740
<v Speaker 2>doing everything by the book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In terms of what the ufc requires and</v>

1903
01:36:06.741 --> 01:36:07.750
<v Speaker 2>what you saw to require.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1904
01:36:07.760 --> 01:36:10.550
<v Speaker 2>So our program has a three strike</v>
<v Speaker 2>policy.</v>

1905
01:36:10.551 --> 01:36:11.990
<v Speaker 2>So basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1906
01:36:11.991 --> 01:36:15.350
<v Speaker 2>if you miss a test for an unexplained</v>
<v Speaker 2>reason three times,</v>

1907
01:36:15.351 --> 01:36:19.370
<v Speaker 2>then it could be a violation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>John's never had one whereabouts strike.</v>

1908
01:36:19.371 --> 01:36:22.430
<v Speaker 2>He's always been available when you saw</v>
<v Speaker 2>it as tried to test them.</v>

1909
01:36:22.820 --> 01:36:24.350
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially recently,</v>

1910
01:36:24.410 --> 01:36:27.440
<v Speaker 2>recently one of the most tested athletes</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the ufc.</v>

1911
01:36:27.650 --> 01:36:32.270
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't there one test in the past where</v>
<v Speaker 2>you saw to showed up at the gym and</v>

1912
01:36:32.271 --> 01:36:35.040
<v Speaker 2>there was some sort of speculation that</v>
<v Speaker 2>john was hiding under the ring preview.</v>

1913
01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:39.630
<v Speaker 2>Sada sada before I got here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard about that at all.</v>

1914
01:36:39.660 --> 01:36:42.110
<v Speaker 2>The details.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know whether it's true or not.</v>

1915
01:36:42.110 --> 01:36:44.360
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a Nevada state athletic</v>
<v Speaker 2>commission test.</v>

1916
01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:46.780
<v Speaker 2>My recollection's right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't he not a test.</v>

1917
01:36:46.880 --> 01:36:50.810
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's no reason in terms of how</v>

1918
01:36:50.811 --> 01:36:55.640
<v Speaker 2>you're looking at this particular case</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this fight should not take place or</v>

1919
01:36:55.641 --> 01:36:57.410
<v Speaker 2>that john should be sanctioned any</v>
<v Speaker 2>further.</v>

1920
01:36:57.470 --> 01:36:58.450
<v Speaker 2>There isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And look,</v>

1921
01:36:58.590 --> 01:37:02.030
<v Speaker 2>it's the least compelling argument,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think you know,</v>

1922
01:37:02.031 --> 01:37:04.640
<v Speaker 2>you have to look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to look at the common sense</v>

1923
01:37:04.641 --> 01:37:09.500
<v Speaker 2>approach to this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A guy who went through a year and a half</v>

1924
01:37:09.501 --> 01:37:14.300
<v Speaker 2>almost suspension to very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would categorize as embarrassing</v>

1925
01:37:14.301 --> 01:37:19.301
<v Speaker 2>public hearings in California along</v>
<v Speaker 2>arbitration hearing before mclaren.</v>

1926
01:37:19.940 --> 01:37:24.080
<v Speaker 2>All this science is rooted out about how</v>
<v Speaker 2>long this stuff stays in your system,</v>

1927
01:37:24.081 --> 01:37:26.900
<v Speaker 2>longterm metabolites for months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe years.</v>

1928
01:37:27.650 --> 01:37:32.300
<v Speaker 2>You're going to choose to use oral</v>
<v Speaker 2>terenna ball still after going through</v>

1929
01:37:32.301 --> 01:37:35.720
<v Speaker 2>all that leading up to a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't buy that.</v>

1930
01:37:35.750 --> 01:37:37.130
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think.</v>

1931
01:37:37.220 --> 01:37:41.870
<v Speaker 2>I think I agree with what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in terms of people fucking up,</v>

1932
01:37:42.170 --> 01:37:47.170
<v Speaker 2>there are no bounds on human stupidity</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in terms of people's ability to do</v>

1933
01:37:47.721 --> 01:37:51.920
<v Speaker 2>impulsive things that are irrational,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that wind up sabotaging their career is</v>

1934
01:37:51.921 --> 01:37:55.920
<v Speaker 2>almost more of an indication that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>are willing to do that than not.</v>

1935
01:37:56.090 --> 01:37:58.950
<v Speaker 3>It's very.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're less likely,</v>

1936
01:37:59.010 --> 01:38:02.100
<v Speaker 3>and this is in terms of especially in</v>
<v Speaker 3>particular in fighters,</v>

1937
01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:05.940
<v Speaker 3>fighters are ridiculously impulsive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the things that categorizes</v>

1938
01:38:06.200 --> 01:38:10.110
<v Speaker 3>and it's a characteristic of the type of</v>
<v Speaker 3>human being that gets involved in that</v>

1939
01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:13.580
<v Speaker 3>line of work in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're wild motherfuckers.</v>

1940
01:38:13.650 --> 01:38:17.090
<v Speaker 3>They're crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They do crazy shit and I just.</v>

1941
01:38:17.091 --> 01:38:18.360
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't buy that.</v>

1942
01:38:18.390 --> 01:38:22.170
<v Speaker 3>That would be new level crazy look.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can I categorize this as a new level?</v>

1943
01:38:22.171 --> 01:38:24.450
<v Speaker 3>Crazy guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Least compelling argument.</v>

1944
01:38:24.451 --> 01:38:25.740
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At least compelling,</v>

1945
01:38:25.741 --> 01:38:28.260
<v Speaker 3>but I think we'd be remiss if we didn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least consider that.</v>

1946
01:38:28.700 --> 01:38:29.670
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1947
01:38:29.671 --> 01:38:33.180
<v Speaker 3>I see your point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't buy it that that part I don't</v>

1948
01:38:33.181 --> 01:38:35.700
<v Speaker 3>buy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I buy all the science and I'm a big John</v>

1949
01:38:35.700 --> 01:38:36.391
<v Speaker 3>Jones fan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1950
01:38:36.391 --> 01:38:39.720
<v Speaker 3>you can call me a John Jones suck up all</v>
<v Speaker 3>day long.</v>

1951
01:38:39.721 --> 01:38:42.420
<v Speaker 3>I think he's one of the greatest of all</v>
<v Speaker 3>time and I think it's not over for him.</v>

1952
01:38:42.420 --> 01:38:46.260
<v Speaker 3>I think he still could reach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even think he's at his peak.</v>

1953
01:38:46.261 --> 01:38:50.340
<v Speaker 3>I think he's still got time to be the</v>
<v Speaker 3>greatest of all time if he hasn't</v>

1954
01:38:50.341 --> 01:38:53.190
<v Speaker 3>already achieved that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think that he's also.</v>

1955
01:38:53.310 --> 01:38:54.800
<v Speaker 3>He's a wild man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1956
01:38:54.810 --> 01:38:56.370
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the reasons why he's so</v>
<v Speaker 3>great.</v>

1957
01:38:56.371 --> 01:38:59.460
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the reasons why you opened</v>
<v Speaker 3>up the fight with shogun at 22 years old</v>

1958
01:38:59.640 --> 01:39:03.080
<v Speaker 3>with a flying knee and he's a wild</v>
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker.</v>

1959
01:39:03.090 --> 01:39:08.090
<v Speaker 3>That's who he is and it's one of many</v>
<v Speaker 3>reasons besides his talent that he's so</v>

1960
01:39:08.851 --> 01:39:12.150
<v Speaker 3>god damn good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know the lows of the lows.</v>

1961
01:39:12.151 --> 01:39:15.330
<v Speaker 3>He's gone through these last two years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You will have to leave.</v>

1962
01:39:15.331 --> 01:39:18.030
<v Speaker 3>How low those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So again,</v>

1963
01:39:18.031 --> 01:39:19.710
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't disagree with you that that's</v>

1964
01:39:19.711 --> 01:39:22.830
<v Speaker 3>not out of the area of consideration,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but man,</v>

1965
01:39:22.831 --> 01:39:24.210
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't.</v>

1966
01:39:24.330 --> 01:39:26.610
<v Speaker 3>I don't think anybody could be that</v>
<v Speaker 3>reckless.</v>

1967
01:39:26.700 --> 01:39:31.700
<v Speaker 3>I hope you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I also worry that fighters often in</v>

1968
01:39:32.641 --> 01:39:34.440
<v Speaker 3>times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not accusing john of doing this,</v>

1969
01:39:34.650 --> 01:39:39.420
<v Speaker 3>but oftentimes surround themselves with</v>
<v Speaker 3>morons and these morons give them poor</v>

1970
01:39:39.421 --> 01:39:44.421
<v Speaker 3>advice and these morons think that they</v>
<v Speaker 3>have ways to skirt systems and get</v>

1971
01:39:45.751 --> 01:39:48.550
<v Speaker 3>around the rules and they have people</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you know,</v>

1972
01:39:49.170 --> 01:39:51.810
<v Speaker 3>throw a bunch of fancy words their way</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they want to believe,</v>

1973
01:39:52.020 --> 01:39:55.080
<v Speaker 3>and this happens all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This happens all the time with fighters</v>

1974
01:39:55.081 --> 01:39:58.740
<v Speaker 3>in regards to financial management and</v>
<v Speaker 3>advice that they get with that.</v>

1975
01:39:59.610 --> 01:40:03.900
<v Speaker 3>I mean I've seen like world class</v>
<v Speaker 3>fighters do ridiculous shit in terms of</v>

1976
01:40:04.050 --> 01:40:07.800
<v Speaker 3>strength and conditioning because some</v>
<v Speaker 3>asshole with a good vocabulary talks him</v>

1977
01:40:07.801 --> 01:40:11.340
<v Speaker 3>into some nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is just one of the things that</v>

1978
01:40:11.341 --> 01:40:15.150
<v Speaker 3>happens with fighters and oftentimes</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can be around someone who gives him</v>

1979
01:40:15.151 --> 01:40:18.960
<v Speaker 3>poor advice in terms of what they can</v>
<v Speaker 3>and cannot get away with when it comes</v>

1980
01:40:18.961 --> 01:40:21.960
<v Speaker 3>to supplementation and when it comes to</v>
<v Speaker 3>steroid use.</v>

1981
01:40:21.990 --> 01:40:22.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

1982
01:40:22.850 --> 01:40:25.890
<v Speaker 3>I see that all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In john's case,</v>

1983
01:40:25.891 --> 01:40:27.960
<v Speaker 3>however,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to give credit where credit's due,</v>

1984
01:40:28.010 --> 01:40:30.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his team after the initial positive with</v>

1985
01:40:30.901 --> 01:40:35.901
<v Speaker 3>the dick pills was very interactive with</v>
<v Speaker 3>me and donna and checking supplements.</v>

1986
01:40:36.151 --> 01:40:38.940
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what line should we go to show they,</v>

1987
01:40:38.970 --> 01:40:40.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to give them credit.</v>

1988
01:40:40.141 --> 01:40:43.560
<v Speaker 3>They definitely showed an increased</v>
<v Speaker 3>exercise of care when it came to</v>

1989
01:40:43.561 --> 01:40:46.440
<v Speaker 3>supplementation with john.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's great to hear and I really</v>

1990
01:40:46.441 --> 01:40:49.350
<v Speaker 3>hope this is a thing of the past and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>hope this is the last time we ever have</v>

1991
01:40:49.351 --> 01:40:53.380
<v Speaker 3>to talk about john in this term and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>moving forward we just talk about in</v>

1992
01:40:53.381 --> 01:40:54.610
<v Speaker 3>terms of his performances</v>

1993
01:40:54.610 --> 01:40:56.320
<v Speaker 2>in his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his fights and you know,</v>

1994
01:40:56.370 --> 01:40:59.030
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's already achieved the youngest sea</v>

1995
01:40:59.200 --> 01:41:01.750
<v Speaker 2>champion of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything else?</v>

1996
01:41:01.930 --> 01:41:03.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I was going to bring this up at the</v>

1997
01:41:03.641 --> 01:41:06.730
<v Speaker 2>beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the golden snitch,</v>

2000
01:41:14.351 --> 01:41:17.350

01:43:45.641 --> 01:43:48.970
<v Speaker 2>He's legit as it gets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So are you going to do anything to</v>

2051
01:43:48.971 --> 01:43:49.804
<v Speaker 2>market this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2052
01:43:49.990 --> 01:43:51.950
<v Speaker 2>that's getting to my story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not marketing,</v>

2053
01:43:51.951 --> 01:43:55.580
<v Speaker 2>but let me finish the story here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm in chicago this year.</v>

2054
01:43:55.581 --> 01:43:56.930
<v Speaker 2>I think there was a paper view.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were there,</v>

2055
01:43:56.931 --> 01:43:57.620
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2056
01:43:57.620 --> 01:44:01.100
<v Speaker 2>So something happened and I was late</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting to the arena and they had cut</v>

2057
01:44:01.101 --> 01:44:03.200
<v Speaker 2>off kind of the loading dock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't get to it.</v>

2058
01:44:03.201 --> 01:44:07.910
<v Speaker 2>So I had my oldest daughter with me and</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we're having a walk through where all</v>

2059
01:44:07.911 --> 01:44:11.540
<v Speaker 2>the crowds walking in and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dudes,</v>

2060
01:44:11.541 --> 01:44:14.420
<v Speaker 2>all the golden snitch picture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>golden snitch.</v>

2061
01:44:14.660 --> 01:44:17.660
<v Speaker 2>My daughter's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck's going on?</v>

2062
01:44:18.080 --> 01:44:18.890
<v Speaker 2>How old is your daughter?</v>

2063
01:44:18.890 --> 01:44:22.670
<v Speaker 2>So she's 22,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so two days ago,</v>

2064
01:44:22.671 --> 01:44:24.860
<v Speaker 2>christmas morning I'm opening up</v>
<v Speaker 2>presents.</v>

2065
01:44:26.180 --> 01:44:29.410
<v Speaker 2>So I get the presence for my daughters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the three of them and my middle daughter</v>

2066
01:44:29.411 --> 01:44:33.950
<v Speaker 2>is very artistic and so they create</v>
<v Speaker 2>these cool sculpted beer mugs and</v>

2067
01:44:33.951 --> 01:44:36.890
<v Speaker 2>there's four of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of them's like bald guy brewing</v>

2068
01:44:37.370 --> 01:44:40.730
<v Speaker 2>novitsky something and one of them says</v>
<v Speaker 2>golden snitch brewing company,</v>

2069
01:44:41.210 --> 01:44:44.690
<v Speaker 2>so it's cool looking thing and she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she drew me a black and white kind of</v>

2070
01:44:44.691 --> 01:44:46.520
<v Speaker 2>rendition of all four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I'm gonna hang up.</v>

2071
01:44:46.521 --> 01:44:48.380
<v Speaker 2>Really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then my girlfriend's there,</v>

2072
01:44:48.381 --> 01:44:50.690
<v Speaker 2>so she hands me the box and she's been</v>
<v Speaker 2>telling me all along.</v>

2073
01:44:50.691 --> 01:44:52.460
<v Speaker 2>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got you the best fucking president</v>

2074
01:44:52.670 --> 01:44:54.200

<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2075
01:44:54.590 --> 01:44:57.200
<v Speaker 2>the hell is this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I opened up the box.</v>

2076
01:44:59.400 --> 01:45:04.070
<v Speaker 2>Oh my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's got this series of t shirts I</v>

2077
01:45:04.080 --> 01:45:05.520
<v Speaker 2>think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What size are you?</v>

2078
01:45:05.910 --> 01:45:07.200
<v Speaker 2>Large.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Large.</v>

2079
01:45:08.070 --> 01:45:08.731
<v Speaker 2>There we go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2080
01:45:08.731 --> 01:45:10.710
<v Speaker 2>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>since you created it,</v>

2081
01:45:11.130 --> 01:45:13.320
<v Speaker 2>you literally and figuratively have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>wear it.</v>

2082
01:45:13.321 --> 01:45:17.580
<v Speaker 2>Now</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is outrageous.</v>

2083
01:45:17.850 --> 01:45:19.940
<v Speaker 2>So that picture there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some.</v>

2084
01:45:21.380 --> 01:45:23.520

<v Speaker 2>You got to own it now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got one for shop too that you can</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he.</v>

2101
01:46:18.240 --> 01:46:20.330
<v Speaker 2>He called you the golden wrap now</v>
<v Speaker 2>changed.</v>

2102
01:46:20.770 --> 01:46:22.280
<v Speaker 2>I thought maybe you haven't been here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's.</v>

2103
01:46:22.350 --> 01:46:23.810
<v Speaker 2>He's informed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Misinformed.</v>

2104
01:46:23.840 --> 01:46:24.760
<v Speaker 2>He thinks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

2105
01:46:24.820 --> 01:46:27.020
<v Speaker 2>you were an employee of usada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>

2106
01:46:27.050 --> 01:46:29.270
<v Speaker 2>And that now you're an employee of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ufc.</v>

2107
01:46:30.020 --> 01:46:32.840
<v Speaker 2>He's misinformed about that and I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>he.</v>

2108
01:46:32.870 --> 01:46:35.120
<v Speaker 2>He likes to call skeptical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's skeptical.</v>

2109
01:46:35.121 --> 01:46:38.000
<v Speaker 2>Hippo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am skeptical as well,</v>

2110
01:46:38.001 --> 01:46:40.730
<v Speaker 2>but I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One thing that I've learned from doing</v>

2111
01:46:40.731 --> 01:46:45.731
<v Speaker 2>this podcast over the years is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no fucking way is it's</v>

2112
01:46:46.310 --> 01:46:50.490
<v Speaker 2>impossible to know everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is impossible</v>

2113
01:46:51.030 --> 01:46:56.030
<v Speaker 3>and you have to rely on the expertise of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people who have spent a lifetime</v>

2114
01:46:56.731 --> 01:46:58.650
<v Speaker 3>studying these things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very important.</v>

2115
01:46:58.920 --> 01:47:03.660
<v Speaker 3>Here's another thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no way these people could be</v>

2116
01:47:03.661 --> 01:47:05.600
<v Speaker 3>lying about this and it wouldn't</v>

2117
01:47:05.720 --> 01:47:08.330
<v Speaker 2>massively damaged their career going</v>
<v Speaker 2>forward.</v>

2118
01:47:08.331 --> 01:47:11.060
<v Speaker 2>It'd be done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone would find out,</v>

2119
01:47:11.180 --> 01:47:13.490
<v Speaker 2>someone would get to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other scientists,</v>

2120
01:47:13.491 --> 01:47:15.740
<v Speaker 2>without them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there would be studies done,</v>

2121
01:47:15.741 --> 01:47:17.900
<v Speaker 2>there will be papers done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The internet would find out about it.</v>

2122
01:47:17.901 --> 01:47:19.910
<v Speaker 2>Everybody would know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no way.</v>

2123
01:47:20.070 --> 01:47:24.620
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty unprecedented in writing</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the lack of these studies that were</v>

2124
01:47:24.621 --> 01:47:26.860
<v Speaker 2>chenko.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One being my sanity even.</v>

2125
01:47:26.861 --> 01:47:27.680
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you say it?</v>

2126
01:47:27.680 --> 01:47:30.640
<v Speaker 2>Rich chenko the chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty unprecedented.</v>

2127
01:47:30.641 --> 01:47:32.930
<v Speaker 2>And they would put these absolutes in</v>
<v Speaker 2>writing.</v>

2128
01:47:33.080 --> 01:47:34.040
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2129
01:47:34.041 --> 01:47:35.060
<v Speaker 2>with this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2130
01:47:35.061 --> 01:47:38.300
<v Speaker 2>I think they looked at it very hard and</v>
<v Speaker 2>detailed and obviously they weren't</v>

2131
01:47:38.301 --> 01:47:42.050
<v Speaker 2>quick and turning it around and we would</v>
<v Speaker 2>have loved this decision to be made a</v>

2132
01:47:42.051 --> 01:47:45.380
<v Speaker 2>lot earlier so we could have rooted and</v>
<v Speaker 2>vetted out with Nevada.</v>

2133
01:47:45.860 --> 01:47:47.700
<v Speaker 2>But they did indeed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2134
01:47:47.770 --> 01:47:51.230
<v Speaker 2>sign their names to these pretty</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolute statements and what,</v>

2135
01:47:51.300 --> 01:47:54.110
<v Speaker 2>what else can the ufc and I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2136
01:47:54.111 --> 01:47:57.320
<v Speaker 2>when these experts are putting those</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutes out there and I get the people</v>

2137
01:47:57.321 --> 01:47:57.740
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2138
01:47:57.740 --> 01:47:59.120
<v Speaker 2>whoops,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you do.</v>

2139
01:47:59.350 --> 01:48:00.790
<v Speaker 3>You got to understand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>folks,</v>

2140
01:48:00.791 --> 01:48:02.950
<v Speaker 3>this would be career suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>

2141
01:48:02.970 --> 01:48:07.120
<v Speaker 3>this is the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is cutting edge science.</v>

2142
01:48:07.121 --> 01:48:10.750
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about there's too many</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that would have a vested interest</v>

2143
01:48:10.751 --> 01:48:15.490
<v Speaker 3>in calling bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not some you don't fuck around when</v>

2144
01:48:15.491 --> 01:48:18.190
<v Speaker 3>it comes to these things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The people that are at the,</v>

2145
01:48:18.430 --> 01:48:21.550
<v Speaker 3>the front of the line when it comes to</v>
<v Speaker 3>catching people on these things in the</v>

2146
01:48:21.551 --> 01:48:25.270
<v Speaker 3>science that they're imploring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're that they're involved with.</v>

2147
01:48:25.271 --> 01:48:29.560
<v Speaker 3>It's this is not.</v>

2148
01:48:29.561 --> 01:48:33.400
<v Speaker 3>with no education.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just not wise and this is what I</v>

2149
01:48:33.401 --> 01:48:37.090
<v Speaker 3>keep seeing over and over again is</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that have some knowledge,</v>

2150
01:48:37.960 --> 01:48:41.680
<v Speaker 3>a little bit of knowledge and they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretending that they are.</v>

2151
01:48:41.710 --> 01:48:43.180
<v Speaker 3>They have a phd in this shit</v>
