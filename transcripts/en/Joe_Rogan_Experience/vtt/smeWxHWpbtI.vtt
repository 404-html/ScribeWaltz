<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches will tell for people who haven't seen the documentary,</v>

<v Speaker 1>what house?</v>

5
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.850
<v Speaker 1>There was a burglary call at the house.</v>

6
00:00:08.851 --> 00:00:10.320

<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

8
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.420
<v Speaker 1>And we checked out the place and inside it was two young girls who were sitting</v>

9
00:00:15.421 --> 00:00:16.720
<v Speaker 1>there on the floor and this home,</v>

<v Speaker 1>with the door knob broken off.</v>

12
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.800
<v Speaker 1>And they said that they were given permission by the owner of the home to spend</v>

13
00:00:22.801 --> 00:00:24.690
<v Speaker 1>the afternoon or day here in her home.</v>

23
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.350
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

24
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:31.471

29
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.921
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

00:00:34.921 --> 00:00:35.754
<v Speaker 1>Okay Mary,</v>

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.680
<v Speaker 1>So I turned left hard and there's a box of fucking shoes,</v>

33
00:00:40.681 --> 00:00:41.071
<v Speaker 1>piles,</v>

34
00:00:41.071 --> 00:00:41.910
<v Speaker 1>a box of shoes.</v>

35
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.130
<v Speaker 1>Like if anyone knows anything about the drug business,</v>

36
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.430
<v Speaker 1>they spend a lot of money on their personal shoes because what else are you</v>

37

<v Speaker 1>gonna spend money on?</v>

38
00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:48.810
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

39
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.120
<v Speaker 1>you can't build a new house in the ghetto here that she should wasting your</v>

40
00:00:51.121 --> 00:00:51.390
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>

41
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.620
<v Speaker 1>but you could have a lot of shoes.</v>

42
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.270
<v Speaker 1>So I saw all these boxes of shoes,</v>

43
00:00:54.271 --> 00:00:55.140
<v Speaker 1>nice high heels,</v>

44
00:00:55.141 --> 00:00:55.441

00:00:55.441 --> 00:00:55.951
<v Speaker 1>all this stuff.</v>

46
00:00:55.951 --> 00:00:56.281
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>

47
00:00:56.281 --> 00:00:56.790
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

48
00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:57.450
<v Speaker 1>there's a girl in here,</v>

49
00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:58.590
<v Speaker 1>spend a lot of money on shoes.</v>

50
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:01.860
<v Speaker 1>And the furniture looked pretty good for the location.</v>

51
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.560
<v Speaker 1>So I opened the closet and he has a fucking duffel bag filled with cash.</v>

52
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:08.970
<v Speaker 1>I pick up actually,</v>

53
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.770
<v Speaker 1>that's really not exactly what happened.</v>

54
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.930
<v Speaker 1>Some anticline guy went in there,</v>

55
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.823
<v Speaker 1>picked up the big,</v>

56
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:14.611
<v Speaker 1>he looks at me,</v>

57
00:01:14.611 --> 00:01:15.061
<v Speaker 1>I looked at him,</v>

58
00:01:15.061 --> 00:01:15.271
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

59
00:01:15.271 --> 00:01:16.021
<v Speaker 1>what are you gonna do a voucher?</v>

60
00:01:16.021 --> 00:01:17.930
<v Speaker 1>This come on and spend all day vouchering them.</v>

61
00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:18.780
<v Speaker 1>I leave it there.</v>

62
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.003
<v Speaker 1>He looks at me,</v>

63
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.731
<v Speaker 1>he looks at me,</v>

64
00:01:20.731 --> 00:01:20.941
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

65
00:01:20.941 --> 00:01:21.630
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

66
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:22.463
<v Speaker 1>he puts it down.</v>

67
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.780
<v Speaker 1>I put my hand in the bag and start stuffing the money in my pockets.</v>

68
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.280
<v Speaker 1>But I had no room.</v>

69
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.971
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have enough room.</v>

70
00:01:26.971 --> 00:01:27.870
<v Speaker 1>I was wearing summer clothes.</v>

71
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.591
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have,</v>

72
00:01:28.591 --> 00:01:30.840
<v Speaker 1>I went to uniform on with the jacket where you can stuff everything.</v>

73
00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:32.643
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

74
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:33.211
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

75
00:01:33.211 --> 00:01:33.990
<v Speaker 1>this is not gonna work.</v>

76
00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.823
<v Speaker 1>It's too much money here.</v>

77
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:35.220
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

78
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.030
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>

79
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.900
<v Speaker 1>you can't draw it out of a building with a big field with money and have the</v>

80
00:01:39.901 --> 00:01:41.460
<v Speaker 1>cops see you because they're going to say,</v>

81
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.420
<v Speaker 1>we had the bed go.</v>

82
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.610
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

83
00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:43.020
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

84
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.910
<v Speaker 1>So my enemy was the cops at this point.</v>

85
00:01:44.911 --> 00:01:45.690
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

86
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.870
<v Speaker 1>I found a way to circle a house for an hour and a half and every possible</v>

87
00:01:48.871 --> 00:01:50.320
<v Speaker 1>direction you could add it.</v>

88
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.310
<v Speaker 1>And then chickie finally pulled up with another guy that was retired from the</v>

89
00:01:53.311 --> 00:01:54.144
<v Speaker 1>jail.</v>

90
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.240
<v Speaker 1>They walked in with their dupe badges on and the landlord lets them in and yeah,</v>

91
00:01:59.671 --> 00:02:00.031
<v Speaker 1>up there.</v>

92
00:02:00.031 --> 00:02:00.361
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

93
00:02:00.361 --> 00:02:00.571
<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>

95
00:02:01.171 --> 00:02:02.610
<v Speaker 1>built that apartment right up there.</v>

96
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:03.420
<v Speaker 1>When he went in,</v>

00:02:04.351 --> 00:02:04.951
<v Speaker 1>I've got a minute later,</v>

99
00:02:04.951 --> 00:02:05.784

<v Speaker 2>and a half was a plant.</v>

150
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.320
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

151
00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.530
<v Speaker 2>she was internal affairs comp.</v>

152
00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe I ever told anybody that.</v>

153
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.341
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

154
00:03:12.341 --> 00:03:13.070
<v Speaker 2>Let's see here.</v>

155
00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:18.070
<v Speaker 2>National Violence Against Women Survey found that 21.5% of men and 35.4% of</v>

156
00:03:19.101 --> 00:03:23.100
<v Speaker 2>women living with same sex partners experience intimate partner physical.</v>

157
00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:25.011
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

158
00:03:25.011 --> 00:03:26.000
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly what we're saying.</v>

159
00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.140
<v Speaker 2>So that shows that lesbians or more likely to be up their partners.</v>

160
00:03:30.141 --> 00:03:35.141
<v Speaker 2>Then gay men are comparable with 7.1 and 20.4% for men and women respectively</v>

161
00:03:37.971 --> 00:03:39.950
<v Speaker 2>with a history of only opposite sex.</v>

162
00:03:39.951 --> 00:03:40.784
<v Speaker 2>Cohabitation.</v>

163
00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:41.690
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

164
00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.810
<v Speaker 2>So what that says is that 7.1% of women have experienced domestic violence by</v>

165
00:03:48.321 --> 00:03:49.070
<v Speaker 2>men,</v>

166
00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:54.070
<v Speaker 2>but 20.4% of men have experienced domestic violence by women.</v>

167
00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.890
<v Speaker 2>The good thing,</v>

168
00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.170
<v Speaker 2>but that says to me is that I am not alone.</v>

169
00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.470
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

170
00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:58.940
<v Speaker 2>but that's Massachusetts.</v>

171
00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:59.990
<v Speaker 2>See that right there.</v>

172
00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.660
<v Speaker 2>Massachusets is filled with monsters.</v>

173
00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:03.131
<v Speaker 2>Drunk.</v>

174
00:04:03.131 --> 00:04:03.964
<v Speaker 2>Those women,</v>

175
00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:05.600
<v Speaker 2>you'll fucking queen.</v>

176
00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:06.950
<v Speaker 2>They beat your ass.</v>

177
00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.150
<v Speaker 2>They're terrible people.</v>

178
00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:10.640
<v Speaker 2>They only check that I ever had.</v>

179
00:04:10.641 --> 00:04:11.391
<v Speaker 2>Take a swing at me.</v>

180
00:04:11.391 --> 00:04:12.860
<v Speaker 2>It was a girl that I dated from Boston.</v>

181
00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.670
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

182
00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.230
<v Speaker 2>She took a swing at me while I was fighting.</v>

183
00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.861
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

184
00:04:15.861 --> 00:04:18.320
<v Speaker 2>I was in the middle of competition back then like I was,</v>

185
00:04:18.321 --> 00:04:19.160
<v Speaker 2>I was taekwondo.</v>

186
00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.480
<v Speaker 2>I was now was kickboxing.</v>

187
00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.260
<v Speaker 2>I was fucking crazy like in this chick took a swing at me and I watched it</v>

188
00:04:24.261 --> 00:04:24.980
<v Speaker 2>coming and I was like,</v>

189
00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.120
<v Speaker 2>I don't even believe this is happening and I ducked under it and I grabbed a</v>

190
00:04:29.121 --> 00:04:29.550
<v Speaker 2>hold of him.</v>

191
00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.781
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

192
00:04:29.781 --> 00:04:30.770
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing?</v>

193
00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:31.820
<v Speaker 2>Are you hitting me?</v>

194
00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:32.870
<v Speaker 2>He's trying to hit me.</v>

195
00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:34.850
<v Speaker 2>I those are the only time I grow ag.</v>

196
00:04:34.851 --> 00:04:35.960
<v Speaker 2>You fucking queer.</v>

197
00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.600
<v Speaker 2>They're monsters.</v>

198
00:04:38.601 --> 00:04:39.201
<v Speaker 2>They drunk.</v>

199
00:04:39.201 --> 00:04:41.690
<v Speaker 2>They eating potatoes just fucking swinging at you.</v>

200
00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:43.390
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's Massachusetts.</v>

201
00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.110
<v Speaker 2>I'll bet you look at the rest of the country.</v>

202
00:04:45.111 --> 00:04:46.910
<v Speaker 2>It's probably totally different numbers.</v>

203
00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.370
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

204
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's totally ever numbers if you like to do hunts aren't fair.</v>

205
00:04:51.661 --> 00:04:52.494
<v Speaker 2>Chase,</v>

206
00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:53.820
<v Speaker 2>if you like doing it,</v>

207
00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:54.420
<v Speaker 2>why do you,</v>

208
00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:57.000
<v Speaker 2>why do they have such a hard time just saying that's what I'd like to do.</v>

209
00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:58.293
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

210
00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:03.660
<v Speaker 2>I spend an enormous amount of time explaining why I like to do what I do.</v>

211
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.433
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

212
00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:08.610
<v Speaker 2>why don't,</v>

213
00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.640
<v Speaker 2>I would love for more of them to explain to me what they like about it instead</v>

214
00:05:11.641 --> 00:05:13.920
<v Speaker 2>of doing it and acting like they did something different.</v>

215
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:14.850
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

216
00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.310
<v Speaker 2>the PR part of it is the network themselves,</v>

217
00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:17.820
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

218
00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.830
<v Speaker 2>The outdoor channel and the sportsmans channel,</v>

219
00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.380
<v Speaker 2>they don't allow you to show high fences.</v>

220
00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.110
<v Speaker 2>That's part of their byline is right.</v>

221
00:05:24.111 --> 00:05:26.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if they say don't show high fences,</v>

222
00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.330
<v Speaker 2>they might not want,</v>

223
00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.220
<v Speaker 2>this is coming from Ben O'brian.</v>

224
00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:29.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

225
00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:30.533
<v Speaker 2>so they might,</v>

226
00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:31.553
<v Speaker 2>they might,</v>

227
00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:33.720
<v Speaker 2>I can't say that they say don't show it.</v>

228
00:05:33.721 --> 00:05:34.950
<v Speaker 2>Or if they're saying don't do it,</v>

229
00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:36.151
<v Speaker 2>I think they say,</v>

230
00:05:36.151 --> 00:05:36.870
<v Speaker 2>don't show it.</v>

231
00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:37.560
<v Speaker 2>Don't show it.</v>

232
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.131
<v Speaker 2>Don't show it.</v>

233
00:05:38.131 --> 00:05:40.590
<v Speaker 2>Because I can't know Jen is on that program.</v>

234
00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:41.101
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

235
00:05:41.101 --> 00:05:42.090
<v Speaker 2>He's on those networks.</v>

236
00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.420
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

237
00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:43.830
<v Speaker 2>He's got a huge show on that network.</v>

238
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.600
<v Speaker 2>He hunts in his fucking yard.</v>

239
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:46.111
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

240
00:05:46.111 --> 00:05:46.501
<v Speaker 2>he's not,</v>

241
00:05:46.501 --> 00:05:47.820
<v Speaker 2>he's not on a big piece of property.</v>

242
00:05:47.821 --> 00:05:50.670
<v Speaker 2>I think he's less than 300 acres or maybe 300 acres.</v>

243
00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:51.930
<v Speaker 2>That's not that much.</v>

244
00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:53.430
<v Speaker 2>And in that 300 acres,</v>

245
00:05:53.431 --> 00:05:54.330
<v Speaker 2>it's all high fence.</v>

246
00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:55.780
<v Speaker 2>He's got African animals,</v>

247
00:05:55.781 --> 00:05:56.820
<v Speaker 2>you've got all kinds of shit in there.</v>

248
00:05:56.821 --> 00:06:01.821
<v Speaker 2>White pig's all in this one area and he hunts high fence almost exclusively.</v>

249
00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:04.910
<v Speaker 2>And when he's hunting on the,</v>

250
00:06:04.911 --> 00:06:07.280
<v Speaker 2>you know it says like spirit wild ranch.</v>

251
00:06:07.281 --> 00:06:07.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

252
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:08.480
<v Speaker 2>that's his yard.</v>

253
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's essentially hunting has pets if you really want to look at it that</v>

254
00:06:12.531 --> 00:06:12.780
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

255
00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:13.070
<v Speaker 2>And He,</v>

256
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.761
<v Speaker 2>his house goes,</v>

257
00:06:13.761 --> 00:06:14.720
<v Speaker 2>sits in his favorite tree.</v>

258
00:06:14.721 --> 00:06:15.400
<v Speaker 2>Stan,</v>

259
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.780
<v Speaker 2>it's probably got a bunch of them all over his property but I don't,</v>

260
00:06:17.781 --> 00:06:18.820
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he's proud of,</v>

261
00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.120
<v Speaker 2>I think in and of itself,</v>

262
00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.270
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel there's anything wrong with that because my brother raises sheep.</v>

263
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:24.163
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

264
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.500
<v Speaker 2>And when he goes out to get the sheep,</v>

265
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:32.420
<v Speaker 2>he goes out with a 22 he's got you irrigated pasture,</v>

266
00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:33.440
<v Speaker 2>he runs lambs.</v>

267
00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:34.730
<v Speaker 2>When he goes out to get a lamb,</v>

268
00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:36.160
<v Speaker 2>it gives a lot of the way,</v>

269
00:06:36.161 --> 00:06:37.160
<v Speaker 2>eat some of it for herself.</v>

270
00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:42.280
<v Speaker 2>Shoes the land with the 22 however he doesn't dress it up like he's hunting the</v>

271
00:06:44.241 --> 00:06:45.620
<v Speaker 2>lambs out on his pasture.</v>

272
00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:47.840
<v Speaker 2>Like it's a wild animal is kind of sneak up on.</v>

273
00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:48.050
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

274
00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:48.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean he did.</v>

275
00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:49.670
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't like put,</v>

276
00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:53.730
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't like put a picture of him in his 22 on in a dead lamb on Facebook.</v>

277
00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:54.603
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

278
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:55.543
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

279
00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:56.893
<v Speaker 2>He's a hunter.</v>

280
00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.930
<v Speaker 2>He's a very avid hunter and never once in his life.</v>

281
00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.020
<v Speaker 2>I wish she was here because I'd like to ask them this question.</v>

282
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:08.290
<v Speaker 2>Never once in his life has he confused the act of farming</v>

283
00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:14.650
<v Speaker 2>organic sheet with the act of hunting wild elk?</v>

284
00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:15.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

285
00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:16.330
<v Speaker 2>It's not confusing to him.</v>

286
00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:17.080
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

287
00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.190
<v Speaker 2>but is it confusing?</v>

288
00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.590
<v Speaker 2>Did you have a good hunting year?</v>

289
00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:22.960
<v Speaker 2>He'd be like so far he got an elk.</v>

290
00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:25.780
<v Speaker 2>What does Bo on national forest land,</v>

291
00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:27.790
<v Speaker 2>he got an antelope with his bowl,</v>

292
00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:29.500
<v Speaker 2>BLM land yard,</v>

293
00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:30.423
<v Speaker 2>and he would never be like,</v>

294
00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:31.350
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

295

<v Speaker 2>I already did it.</v>

299
00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:43.140
<v Speaker 2>It's just so weird to me that I feel like we talked about this with dog during</v>

301
00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:52.800
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't like get gussied up in Camo and get like a bunch of pink accents and</v>

302
00:07:55.191 --> 00:07:57.880
<v Speaker 2>like put pink accents all over his gun and go out</v>

<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

309
00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:08.980

310
00:08:08.981 --> 00:08:11.020
<v Speaker 2>but his fence is only,</v>
