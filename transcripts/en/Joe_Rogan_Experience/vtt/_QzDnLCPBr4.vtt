1
00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:02.440
<v Speaker 1>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:05.040
<v Speaker 2>What were you saying before the podcast</v>
<v Speaker 2>started?</v>

3
00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.470
<v Speaker 2>You were gonna bring it up again about</v>
<v Speaker 2>veganism coming from a religion.</v>

4
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Veganism started with the seventh</v>

5
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.980
<v Speaker 1>adventist church,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe.</v>

6
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.240
<v Speaker 1>So there was um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

7
00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a group of people that had a church and</v>

8
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.440
<v Speaker 1>the guy that led the church as part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the church was like,</v>

9
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were following the Jewish kosher</v>

10
00:00:25.021 --> 00:00:28.920
<v Speaker 1>laws or whatever at first and it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like no pigs or whatever else.</v>

11
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.040
<v Speaker 1>Shell fish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think pigs are shellfish and then the</v>

12
00:00:32.041 --> 00:00:34.950
<v Speaker 1>guy just said like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just sort of took it to a next level</v>

13
00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:35.730
<v Speaker 1>and said like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

14
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.560
<v Speaker 1>no meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no animal products at all.</v>

15
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.550
<v Speaker 1>And so these people that were in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>church were like the first real group of</v>

16
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.180
<v Speaker 1>vegans a church.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seventh adventist I think is what</v>

17
00:00:45.181 --> 00:00:47.130
<v Speaker 1>it's called is where it came from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 18,</v>

18
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.100
<v Speaker 1>63 is when that movement I guess started</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody.</v>

19
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.540
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd started early.</v>

20
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure people were doing it earlier</v>
<v Speaker 1>than that obviously,</v>

21
00:00:53.881 --> 00:00:57.480
<v Speaker 1>but I think that that's where the roots</v>
<v Speaker 1>came in and I just find that really</v>

22
00:00:57.481 --> 00:00:59.400
<v Speaker 1>interesting because it does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

23
00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.170
<v Speaker 1>it does seem like a religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like,</v>

24
00:01:01.171 --> 00:01:02.560
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

25
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.910
<v Speaker 1>it seems like a lot of times you get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

26
00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.330
<v Speaker 1>I get called out a lot on instagram and</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that from people that are</v>

27
00:01:09.331 --> 00:01:11.280
<v Speaker 1>Vegan saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe you'd do this and blah</v>

28
00:01:11.281 --> 00:01:12.780
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would never go on their page and</v>

29
00:01:12.781 --> 00:01:15.280
<v Speaker 1>say anything to them at all there</v>

30
00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:16.660
<v Speaker 2>proselytizing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

31
00:01:16.661 --> 00:01:18.160
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a big part of this whole</v>

32
00:01:18.161 --> 00:01:19.200
<v Speaker 2>community is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

33
00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.810
<v Speaker 2>there's the moral high ground they stand</v>
<v Speaker 2>on it and then a lot of these people,</v>

34
00:01:22.811 --> 00:01:25.780
<v Speaker 2>especially people with Vegan in their</v>
<v Speaker 2>name and their screen name,</v>

35
00:01:25.781 --> 00:01:30.781
<v Speaker 2>they always go after people that try to</v>
<v Speaker 2>shame people and what they're doing is</v>

36
00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.250
<v Speaker 2>in many ways is a very good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not participating factory</v>

37
00:01:36.251 --> 00:01:37.150
<v Speaker 2>farming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

38
00:01:37.151 --> 00:01:40.570
<v Speaker 2>They're not participating in the horrors</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we see these fucking peta videos</v>

39
00:01:40.571 --> 00:01:44.110
<v Speaker 2>where you see cows and pigs and</v>
<v Speaker 2>chickens.</v>

40
00:01:44.111 --> 00:01:45.340
<v Speaker 2>They're just being tortured.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All that.</v>

41
00:01:45.341 --> 00:01:46.630
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is disgusting.</v>

42
00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.750
<v Speaker 2>And that should be eliminated and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't be a part of modern culture,</v>

43
00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.580
<v Speaker 2>but in terms of like the humane raising</v>
<v Speaker 2>and killing of animals,</v>

44
00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.250
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to live forever and I</v>

45
00:01:57.251 --> 00:01:59.950
<v Speaker 2>don't care what you say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not into animal suffering.</v>

46
00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they should suffer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you try to say that people are</v>

47
00:02:02.291 --> 00:02:05.140
<v Speaker 2>not herbivores or that people are</v>
<v Speaker 2>herbivores rather,</v>

48
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.000
<v Speaker 2>and then we're not omnivores,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're crazy.</v>

49
00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.410
<v Speaker 2>It's just not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not fact and they show pictures.</v>

50
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.530
<v Speaker 2>These are not the teeth of a carnivore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These were not carnivores.</v>

51
00:02:13.531 --> 00:02:14.980
<v Speaker 2>Stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're omnivores.</v>

52
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We looked real similar in our teeth to</v>

53
00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.070
<v Speaker 2>fucking chimps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chimps are omnivores and the human diet</v>

54
00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.400
<v Speaker 2>is a very complex thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you attach that human diet to</v>

55
00:02:27.401 --> 00:02:29.080
<v Speaker 2>ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it gets really,</v>

56
00:02:29.081 --> 00:02:32.500
<v Speaker 2>screw it because you're not dealing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not dealing with people that are</v>

57
00:02:32.501 --> 00:02:37.501
<v Speaker 2>being honest about dietary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what is really important and for</v>

58
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.780
<v Speaker 2>dietary requirements,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how your body functions.</v>

59
00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.630
<v Speaker 2>What the studies show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look at it objectively,</v>

60
00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.750
<v Speaker 2>the objective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first thing anybody should say first</v>

61
00:02:46.751 --> 00:02:49.390
<v Speaker 2>thing across the board,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get rid all the fucking sugar.</v>

62
00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.460
<v Speaker 2>That's number one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get rid of all the refined</v>

63
00:02:51.461 --> 00:02:53.980
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat more vegetables.</v>

64
00:02:53.981 --> 00:02:56.590
<v Speaker 2>I think you guys don't eat more</v>
<v Speaker 2>vegetables.</v>

65
00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.490
<v Speaker 2>Eat healthy fats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get some form omega fatty acids.</v>

66
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.170
<v Speaker 2>Recognize that the omega fatty acids</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you get from flax seed oil or not</v>

67
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.120
<v Speaker 2>as bioavailable is fact from studies not</v>
<v Speaker 2>as bioavailable.</v>

68
00:03:10.121 --> 00:03:11.860
<v Speaker 2>Is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mega fatty acids you get from fish and</v>

69
00:03:11.861 --> 00:03:13.900
<v Speaker 2>meat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just not the meat.</v>

70
00:03:13.901 --> 00:03:14.711
<v Speaker 2>The protein,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you say,</v>

71
00:03:14.711 --> 00:03:18.610
<v Speaker 2>well broadly has 15 groups,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not as bioavailable.</v>

72
00:03:18.611 --> 00:03:20.770
<v Speaker 2>You fucks and you know it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just not.</v>

73
00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you can get bioavailable protein from</v>

74
00:03:24.941 --> 00:03:26.290
<v Speaker 2>plants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get it from him.</v>

75
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.840
<v Speaker 2>You get it from Keenwah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get it from peas.</v>

76
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.010
<v Speaker 2>PEA proteins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very good.</v>

77
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.270
<v Speaker 2>But it's not as good as the protein that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get from meat.</v>

78
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.960
<v Speaker 2>It's just not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a high right,</v>

79
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.820
<v Speaker 2>but no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You never saw 100 beck from the bottom</v>

80
00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.380
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like lower back.</v>

81
00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:47.410
<v Speaker 2>We can make that like a lumbar pad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Work as a lumberjack.</v>

82
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:49.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

83
00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.810
<v Speaker 2>Sleeps all night and he works all day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if,</v>

84
00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.320
<v Speaker 2>if you look at Roy Nelson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like the size of a really good</v>

85
00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:58.850
<v Speaker 2>middleweight yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

86
00:03:58.851 --> 00:03:59.330
<v Speaker 2>he is.</v>

87
00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:00.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But meanwhile,</v>

88
00:04:00.351 --> 00:04:02.600
<v Speaker 2>the guy knocked out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chuck Congo,</v>

89
00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.370
<v Speaker 2>knocked out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brendan Schaub,</v>

90
00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.590
<v Speaker 2>knocked out some big fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>heavyweights,</v>

91
00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.880
<v Speaker 2>knocked out Mitrione.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean fucking isn't announced and</v>

92
00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.740
<v Speaker 2>knocked out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people actually have.</v>

93
00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.350
<v Speaker 2>They'll show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did he knock out?</v>

94
00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.750
<v Speaker 2>I think I do not remember that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

95
00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.600
<v Speaker 2>Um.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was the worst thing is it's with</v>

96
00:04:23.601 --> 00:04:26.180
<v Speaker 2>his right hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you would think that people go to the</v>

97
00:04:26.181 --> 00:04:27.770
<v Speaker 2>hill to left up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

98
00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:30.490
<v Speaker 2>But somehow he connect anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

99
00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.070
<v Speaker 2>you know what's going to happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can stop it now.</v>

100
00:04:34.071 --> 00:04:35.710
<v Speaker 2>Almost knocked out over him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember that?</v>

101
00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:36.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

102
00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:37.730
<v Speaker 2>He heard over him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

103
00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.110
<v Speaker 2>Stephen's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ crazy.</v>

104
00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean Roy is like six feet tall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stephan struve seven feet tall.</v>

105
00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean fucking animal is an animal.</v>

106
00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.880
<v Speaker 2>And I honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean look at his gut right there.</v>

107
00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.670
<v Speaker 2>How much is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It weighs about 2:50,</v>

108
00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:56.563
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

109
00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.891
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

110
00:04:57.891 --> 00:05:02.891
<v Speaker 2>I'm not bullshitting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is 50 pounds overweight and he's a</v>

111
00:05:04.101 --> 00:05:06.140
<v Speaker 2>world class athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

112
00:05:06.141 --> 00:05:09.050
<v Speaker 2>you cannot say that Roy Nelson is on a</v>
<v Speaker 2>world class fighter.</v>

113
00:05:09.051 --> 00:05:12.920
<v Speaker 2>You just know a world class fighter and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's 50 pounds overweight.</v>

114
00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.220
<v Speaker 2>So you dropped down 50 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now you're 200 pounds,</v>

115
00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.050
<v Speaker 2>you make 85,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you cut weight,</v>

116
00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.530
<v Speaker 2>everybody does that cut 15 pounds or 85</v>
<v Speaker 2>year old world champion.</v>

117
00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:23.900
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no butter bean.</v>

118
00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.220
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were somewhere,</v>

119
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:27.590
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the lead commissioner told me from</v>

120
00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:31.400
<v Speaker 2>all the boxes on the card,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had actually the best blood pressure</v>

121
00:05:31.401 --> 00:05:36.401
<v Speaker 2>and cholesterol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said we weren't a shock that the guy</v>

122
00:05:36.651 --> 00:05:39.560
<v Speaker 2>is in phenomenal shape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what they told us.</v>

123
00:05:39.561 --> 00:05:40.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's insane.</v>

124

<v Speaker 2>Butter being made.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Him Look like Rodriguez.</v>

125
00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:46.980
<v Speaker 2>Look at him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

126
00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:48.000
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he looks good.</v>

127
00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:50.720
<v Speaker 2>His whole family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He looks exactly like that.</v>

128
00:05:50.721 --> 00:05:52.550
<v Speaker 2>I hear go upper right hand corner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

129
00:05:52.551 --> 00:05:54.110
<v Speaker 2>that's what he looked like when he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>at its worse.</v>

130
00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:58.010
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile he's another guy knocked dudes</v>
<v Speaker 2>dead man.</v>

131
00:05:58.011 --> 00:06:00.110
<v Speaker 2>He is so funny at such a good time with</v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

132
00:06:00.111 --> 00:06:03.110
<v Speaker 2>And there was a prince George in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kennedy.</v>

133
00:06:03.111 --> 00:06:04.310
<v Speaker 2>He was there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a player.</v>

134
00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.800
<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very funny guy.</v>

135
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:10.990
<v Speaker 2>That's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

136
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:16.190
<v Speaker 2>he's a fucking hell of a cook apparently</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't tell,</v>

137
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:20.570
<v Speaker 2>but it's like there's food watching a</v>
<v Speaker 2>video of butter beans cooking some ribs.</v>

138
00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.070
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>damn,</v>

139
00:06:22.071 --> 00:06:23.720
<v Speaker 2>that looks legit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like yes.</v>

140
00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.580
<v Speaker 2>Smoker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's cooking them in a smoker?</v>

141
00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:27.800
<v Speaker 2>He broke the rule though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't get high if your own supply.</v>

142
00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:32.700
<v Speaker 2>Jamie was watching the video of soccer</v>
<v Speaker 2>Berg.</v>

143
00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:35.480
<v Speaker 2>How did it go?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He should know the answer is</v>

144
00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:41.470
<v Speaker 3>he dad had to go again today and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was watching right before you got here</v>

145
00:06:41.471 --> 00:06:43.090
<v Speaker 3>in this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know where she was from,</v>

146
00:06:43.091 --> 00:06:45.340
<v Speaker 3>but she was saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're the CEO of this company and you</v>

147
00:06:45.341 --> 00:06:47.020
<v Speaker 3>should know some of these answers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she was like,</v>

148
00:06:47.021 --> 00:06:49.720
<v Speaker 3>listing all the shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't know it was like this is</v>

149
00:06:49.721 --> 00:06:51.250
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I afterwards,</v>

150
00:06:51.251 --> 00:06:53.730
<v Speaker 3>now they've shown,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I guess it's part of nonpublic</v>

151
00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:55.030
<v Speaker 3>information,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has notes.</v>

152
00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:57.640
<v Speaker 3>Oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he had like as references that he</v>

153
00:06:57.641 --> 00:06:59.350
<v Speaker 3>was looking at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've only seen one picture of it.</v>

154
00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:03.010
<v Speaker 3>Just very weird stuff that like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seems blatantly obvious that he should</v>

155
00:07:03.011 --> 00:07:05.710
<v Speaker 3>know or should say that's different from</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we've.</v>

156
00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.130
<v Speaker 3>Maybe we think we should.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

157
00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:08.160
<v Speaker 3>I think they should be able to.</v>

158
00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:10.700
<v Speaker 2>Fellas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get the impression that this company</v>

159
00:07:10.701 --> 00:07:13.430
<v Speaker 2>grew so fast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't even know what the fuck is</v>

160
00:07:13.431 --> 00:07:14.480
<v Speaker 2>going on in now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

161
00:07:14.481 --> 00:07:17.540
<v Speaker 2>that was the other thing he was talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about their influence on possible.</v>

162
00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:19.760
<v Speaker 2>Are we going to continue?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will continue,</v>

163
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:20.690
<v Speaker 2>don't worry about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

164
00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:24.890
<v Speaker 2>he was talking about his influence on</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these different upcoming elections</v>

165
00:07:24.891 --> 00:07:27.830
<v Speaker 2>that were coming up and about how they</v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to make sure that there was no</v>

166
00:07:27.831 --> 00:07:30.530
<v Speaker 2>bots that were influencing these</v>
<v Speaker 2>elections.</v>

167
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:32.210
<v Speaker 2>And I stopped and thought about it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

168
00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.700
<v Speaker 2>oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In that moment of him saying that,</v>

169
00:07:34.701 --> 00:07:37.310
<v Speaker 2>I realized like what pressure he must be</v>
<v Speaker 2>under,</v>

170
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:38.990
<v Speaker 2>what pressure that companies under</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

171
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:42.920
<v Speaker 2>They went from being a thing where</v>
<v Speaker 2>people could share pictures like of,</v>

172
00:07:42.921 --> 00:07:44.740
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this isn't our summer vacation.</v>

173
00:07:44.741 --> 00:07:45.511
<v Speaker 2>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

174
00:07:45.511 --> 00:07:47.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking we're going to go to the pub on</v>

175
00:07:47.331 --> 00:07:49.730
<v Speaker 2>Friday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what facebook kind of was,</v>

176
00:07:49.731 --> 00:07:52.040
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>People would talk about certain things</v>

177
00:07:52.041 --> 00:07:53.780
<v Speaker 2>in the news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would have opinions.</v>

178
00:07:53.781 --> 00:07:55.790
<v Speaker 2>You put up something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of people comment on it.</v>

179
00:07:55.940 --> 00:08:00.940
<v Speaker 2>That's what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now with this last election and with him</v>

180
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:06.800
<v Speaker 2>testifying in front of Congress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I'm seeing is facebook being like</v>

181
00:08:06.801 --> 00:08:11.801
<v Speaker 2>one of the most important sources of</v>
<v Speaker 2>influence in the world today,</v>

182
00:08:12.621 --> 00:08:16.760
<v Speaker 2>and it's not really being completely</v>
<v Speaker 2>managed.</v>

183
00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:19.220
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

184
00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:21.280
<v Speaker 3>awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like the Russians,</v>

185
00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:22.121
<v Speaker 3>the Russians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

186
00:08:22.121 --> 00:08:25.660
<v Speaker 3>Maybe there's a little bit like Google</v>
<v Speaker 3>needs to be looked into.</v>

187
00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:29.320
<v Speaker 3>What was going on with my mic?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Google also probably like they have a</v>

188
00:08:29.321 --> 00:08:31.780
<v Speaker 3>data.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think someone was just looking into</v>

189
00:08:31.781 --> 00:08:32.200
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

190
00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:34.330
<v Speaker 3>people downloaded their facebook profile</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're like,</v>

191
00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:35.970
<v Speaker 3>my files one gigabyte.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

192
00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:38.770
<v Speaker 3>how much data is in here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>People found out a way to download</v>

193
00:08:38.771 --> 00:08:40.270
<v Speaker 3>theirs and find their information and</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

194
00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:43.510
<v Speaker 3>what does facebook know about me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Apparently there's also one that Google</v>

195
00:08:43.511 --> 00:08:46.670
<v Speaker 3>has on everyone and it's much larger to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the busy.</v>

196
00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:50.730
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ooh.</v>

197
00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:53.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm not shocked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

198
00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:54.060
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's.</v>

199
00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:56.280
<v Speaker 2>And here's the thing that it an endless</v>
<v Speaker 2>cycle.</v>

200
00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:58.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we just don't have that next</v>

201
00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:00.950
<v Speaker 2>unacceptable word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

202
00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.910
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like everybody knows.</v>

203
00:09:02.911 --> 00:09:07.710
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of people know that as far</v>
<v Speaker 2>as somebody who's a doesn't have is</v>

204
00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:12.690
<v Speaker 2>developmentally disabled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Retarded was kind of the latest term</v>

205
00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:15.330
<v Speaker 2>that was once acceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's clearly not now.</v>

206
00:09:15.331 --> 00:09:17.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean that is kind of the point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but before that,</v>

207
00:09:17.941 --> 00:09:20.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>moron was a medical term wasn't.</v>

208
00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:23.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mongoloid idiot was what they used to</v>

209
00:09:23.341 --> 00:09:27.350
<v Speaker 2>call 'em down syndrome children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was like 100 years ago.</v>

210
00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:29.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was on the birth certificate.</v>

211
00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:29.910
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm saying,</v>

212
00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who are saying,</v>

213
00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:35.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just to stop saying they're not wrong,</v>

214
00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:40.200
<v Speaker 2>that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there is also another word down the</v>

215
00:09:40.201 --> 00:09:40.891
<v Speaker 2>pipeline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

216
00:09:40.891 --> 00:09:45.330
<v Speaker 2>There's something else that's coming</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's going to be a medical word or</v>

217
00:09:45.331 --> 00:09:47.730
<v Speaker 2>term and then that'll be used to insult</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

218
00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:50.250
<v Speaker 2>but that's the way people use language.</v>

219
00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:55.250
<v Speaker 2>Like once we identify this is the word</v>
<v Speaker 2>people use to label someone with a</v>

220
00:09:56.550 --> 00:10:00.930
<v Speaker 2>developmental disability,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people in the slang will grow from that.</v>

221
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:03.570
<v Speaker 2>People will start using that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

222
00:10:03.571 --> 00:10:07.710
<v Speaker 2>what's interesting to me is that when</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about words,</v>

223
00:10:07.711 --> 00:10:09.600
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to change the way</v>
<v Speaker 2>people think.</v>

224
00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:14.310
<v Speaker 2>So words are supposed to convey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Intent is supposed to be sounds that we</v>

225
00:10:14.311 --> 00:10:19.110
<v Speaker 2>all agree mean a certain thing and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>more depth,</v>

226
00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:23.910
<v Speaker 2>the more access towards you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more you can sort of flavor your</v>

227
00:10:23.911 --> 00:10:25.470
<v Speaker 2>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I understand what you're saying.</v>

228
00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:29.010
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're saying this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kinda get it,</v>

229
00:10:29.011 --> 00:10:31.530
<v Speaker 2>but you feel like this fucking guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

230
00:10:31.531 --> 00:10:33.200
<v Speaker 2>well Tom is really mad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

231
00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:35.140
<v Speaker 2>That and to take that out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

232
00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:40.430
<v Speaker 2>It's like I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So sometimes you take those things out</v>

233
00:10:40.651 --> 00:10:42.780
<v Speaker 2>when you're like on a television show or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>

234
00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:47.670
<v Speaker 2>but all television shows because of that</v>
<v Speaker 2>all censored television shows only</v>

235
00:10:47.671 --> 00:10:50.700
<v Speaker 2>exists within a certain band.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

236
00:10:50.701 --> 00:10:52.800
<v Speaker 2>A certain frequency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They never get out of that.</v>

237
00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:55.020
<v Speaker 2>Like the Joey Diaz frequency is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

238
00:10:55.021 --> 00:10:57.420
<v Speaker 2>there's no fucking roof.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no fence.</v>

239
00:10:58.400 --> 00:10:59.233
<v Speaker 2>True.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>

240
00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:03.930
<v Speaker 2>this frequency that you get on like late</v>
<v Speaker 2>night talk shows or sitcoms,</v>

241
00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:09.170
<v Speaker 2>this very narrow band that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's no contact in that band.</v>

242
00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:11.340
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you motherfucker this.</v>

243
00:11:11.341 --> 00:11:13.970
<v Speaker 2>All those things are not in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is what you're all about.</v>

244
00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:16.080
<v Speaker 2>I feel like whenever you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For me,</v>

245
00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:19.230
<v Speaker 2>when I'm watching something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of my brain's always like,</v>

246
00:11:19.231 --> 00:11:22.140
<v Speaker 2>go find a motherfucker somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You kind of want it.</v>
