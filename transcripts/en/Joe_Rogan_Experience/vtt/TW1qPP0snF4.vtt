00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:02.890
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches,</v>

2
00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:03.670
<v Speaker 1>Pokemon,</v>

3
00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:04.481
<v Speaker 1>the Pokemon games,</v>

4
00:00:04.481 --> 00:00:07.750
<v Speaker 1>taking it to the next level because now it explain what's going on.</v>

5
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:08.411
<v Speaker 1>It's way to,</v>

6
00:00:08.411 --> 00:00:09.580
<v Speaker 1>to say what Pokemon is.</v>

7
00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:10.810
<v Speaker 1>It takes Google maps,</v>

8
00:00:10.811 --> 00:00:12.070
<v Speaker 1>you have to sign into Google,</v>

9
00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.940
<v Speaker 1>it takes Google maps and all the information that's in Google maps and it makes</v>

10
00:00:15.941 --> 00:00:17.650
<v Speaker 1>it the level of video game.</v>

11
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.660
<v Speaker 1>So instead of playing a level,</v>

12
00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.010
<v Speaker 1>you're playing your own street,</v>

13
00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.650
<v Speaker 1>you're finding you're finding creatures in your house.</v>

14
00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:24.843
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

15
00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:26.410
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>

16
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.290
<v Speaker 1>so then there's places like churches are called Jim's.</v>

17
00:00:29.291 --> 00:00:30.190
<v Speaker 1>That's where you go.</v>

18
00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:31.510
<v Speaker 1>And if you go to a church,</v>

19
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

20
00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.740
<v Speaker 1>you can train your fighter to be stronger and stuff like that.</v>

21
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.720
<v Speaker 1>So you're using real world,</v>

22
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:38.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

23
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:39.910
<v Speaker 1>places and like,</v>

24
00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:40.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

25
00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.140
<v Speaker 1>like landmarks and you're finding things that like water fountains.</v>

26
00:00:44.141 --> 00:00:45.340
<v Speaker 1>Like if you go to the water fountain,</v>

27
00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:46.900
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of coins there.</v>

28
00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.890
<v Speaker 1>So it's using the,</v>

29
00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.300
<v Speaker 1>and what's crazy is like if you're at the comedy store it on Google maps,</v>

30
00:00:52.301 --> 00:00:53.920
<v Speaker 1>you can like upload your own photos,</v>

31
00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:54.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

32
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.730
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

33
00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.160
<v Speaker 1>like I was at the comedy store it on Google maps,</v>

34
00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.860
<v Speaker 1>so it pulls that information also.</v>

35
00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.150
<v Speaker 1>So if you're playing the game,</v>

36
00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.930
<v Speaker 1>you'll be like,</v>

37
00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:02.111
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

38
00:01:02.111 --> 00:01:04.420
<v Speaker 1>there's Andy Kaufman sign.</v>

39
00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:06.130
<v Speaker 1>If we go to the Andy Kaufman sign,</v>

40
00:01:06.131 --> 00:01:10.120
<v Speaker 1>we can get some treasures and it shows you the Andy Kaufman sign in the video</v>

41
00:01:10.121 --> 00:01:10.780
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>

42
00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.220
<v Speaker 1>But here's the crazy thing.</v>

43
00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.170
<v Speaker 1>In one like two days,</v>

44
00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.380
<v Speaker 1>it's almost every single person has downloaded it and played it.</v>

45
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.630
<v Speaker 1>And the crazy thing I was thinking of is how awesome is it that it's connected</v>

46
00:01:22.631 --> 00:01:24.510
<v Speaker 1>to Google and we're sending cause it,</v>

47
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.650
<v Speaker 1>it opens your camera at parts of the game when you're battling and it's scanning</v>

48
00:01:29.651 --> 00:01:30.221
<v Speaker 1>your room,</v>

49
00:01:30.221 --> 00:01:31.054
<v Speaker 1>your houses,</v>

50
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:32.920
<v Speaker 1>and it's sending it to Google.</v>

51
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.450
<v Speaker 1>So this is like the best way that Google is now getting a complete map of our</v>

52
00:01:37.451 --> 00:01:38.560
<v Speaker 1>house inside.</v>

53
00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:39.550
<v Speaker 1>It's uh,</v>

54
00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:40.930
<v Speaker 1>like it's,</v>

55
00:01:40.931 --> 00:01:45.340
<v Speaker 1>it's scanning every street and like one year your Google is going to be able to</v>

56
00:01:45.341 --> 00:01:50.341
<v Speaker 1>have to see every single inch of every single place inside and outside because</v>

57
00:01:50.561 --> 00:01:51.130
<v Speaker 1>of this game.</v>

58
00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.881
<v Speaker 1>How long has it been out?</v>

59
00:01:51.881 --> 00:01:52.451
<v Speaker 1>Like three days,</v>

60
00:01:52.451 --> 00:01:52.750
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

61
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:53.140
<v Speaker 1>Three days.</v>

62
00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.471
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>

63
00:01:53.471 --> 00:01:55.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm more phones on android than Tinder.</v>

64
00:01:55.511 --> 00:01:56.344
<v Speaker 2>And it's about the past.</v>

65
00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:57.010
<v Speaker 1>Twitter.</v>

66
00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

67
00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.560
<v Speaker 1>I really think we should bring typewriters back.</v>

68
00:01:59.561 --> 00:02:00.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

69
00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.380
<v Speaker 1>And no one's thinking about this though,</v>

70
00:02:02.381 --> 00:02:03.270
<v Speaker 1>weren't just low.</v>

71
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.840
<v Speaker 1>Opening our camera and recording our rooms and sending it to Google can wait a</v>

72
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:08.120
<v Speaker 1>minute.</v>

73
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.953
<v Speaker 1>Is this real</v>

74
00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.880
<v Speaker 2>Joe [inaudible] disposal?</v>

75
00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.970
<v Speaker 2>I knew we were going to talk about it.</v>

76
00:02:12.971 --> 00:02:14.140
<v Speaker 2>So I pulled up some stuff already.</v>

77
00:02:14.141 --> 00:02:14.974
<v Speaker 2>There's like a,</v>

78
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.120
<v Speaker 2>the interesting thing that's happening with it being on open gps maps is those</v>

79
00:02:19.121 --> 00:02:19.601
<v Speaker 2>places,</v>

80
00:02:19.601 --> 00:02:20.470
<v Speaker 2>those locations,</v>

81
00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.950
<v Speaker 2>like there's a guy's home that's been turned into one of these gyms and he's</v>

82
00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.690
<v Speaker 2>like mad that people are showing up outside of it.</v>

83
00:02:25.691 --> 00:02:25.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

84
00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:26.613
<v Speaker 1>Place.</v>

85
00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.540
<v Speaker 1>It's because he bought an old church and so churches in the game automatically</v>

86
00:02:30.541 --> 00:02:31.161
<v Speaker 1>become Jim.</v>

87
00:02:31.161 --> 00:02:32.050
<v Speaker 1>So people are hanging out.</v>

88
00:02:32.051 --> 00:02:32.101
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

89
00:02:32.101 --> 00:02:32.420
<v Speaker 1>Outside</v>

90
00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.260
<v Speaker 2>of his house now.</v>

91
00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.780
<v Speaker 2>But also interesting things like this has happened.</v>

92
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.920
<v Speaker 2>Where are the west boat?</v>

93
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.430
<v Speaker 2>Westboro Baptist Church has been overtaken by a gay friendly Pokemon.</v>

94
00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.070
<v Speaker 2>And so people were like kind of,</v>

95
00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.330
<v Speaker 2>I don't know necessarily trolling them and whatnot,</v>

96
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.843
<v Speaker 2>but then,</v>

97
00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:47.080
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

98
00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.460
<v Speaker 2>so by walking around and looking for things,</v>

99
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.970
<v Speaker 2>a teenager found a dead body somewhere and just three days they've already</v>

100
00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.680
<v Speaker 2>dead body found by teenager hunting water Pokemon.</v>

101
00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.380
<v Speaker 2>She found it underneath the bridge.</v>

102
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.190
<v Speaker 2>Oh my</v>

103
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.023
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>

104
00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.170
<v Speaker 1>This part two</v>

105
00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.490
<v Speaker 3>I was trying to get a water,</v>

106
00:03:04.491 --> 00:03:05.900
<v Speaker 3>Pokemon Wiggins totes,</v>

107
00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.883
<v Speaker 3>CNN.</v>

108
00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.890
<v Speaker 3>Instead she made the alarming and alarming discovery,</v>

109
00:03:09.891 --> 00:03:13.880
<v Speaker 3>a dead body close to the Wyoming highway seven 89 bridge.</v>

110
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.120
<v Speaker 3>I probably would have never went down there if it weren't for this game.</v>

111
00:03:17.121 --> 00:03:17.954
<v Speaker 3>She admitted,</v>

112
00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.680
<v Speaker 3>but the scary incident isn't deterring her and says she will continue to play.</v>

113
00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.640
<v Speaker 1>I saw somebody playing on the highway on the way here.</v>

114
00:03:26.641 --> 00:03:27.960
<v Speaker 1>I saw somebody playing on the highway.</v>

115
00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.250
<v Speaker 1>It's bad enough we don't need the last night when I was waiting for my Uber at</v>

116
00:03:32.251 --> 00:03:32.780
<v Speaker 1>my house,</v>

117
00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.050
<v Speaker 1>I just three minutes,</v>

118
00:03:34.051 --> 00:03:35.880
<v Speaker 1>I saw two different groups of kids,</v>

119
00:03:35.881 --> 00:03:39.960
<v Speaker 1>like one on skateboards and one on bikes just playing the game and what's scary</v>

120
00:03:39.961 --> 00:03:44.961
<v Speaker 1>is like on that article now armed robbers are robbing people at certain places</v>

121
00:03:45.511 --> 00:03:47.880
<v Speaker 1>in the game because they know the kids are going to be there with like new</v>

122
00:03:47.881 --> 00:03:49.350
<v Speaker 1>phones like I phones and stuff.</v>

123
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:52.680
<v Speaker 1>So they're waiting at certain places coming out stealing our phones.</v>

124
00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.580
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>

125
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.190
<v Speaker 3>Because it's same allows players to drop module in a real world location to</v>

126
00:03:59.191 --> 00:04:03.210
<v Speaker 3>attract high numbers of Pokemon for 30 minutes.</v>

127
00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.290
<v Speaker 3>The lure modules have reportedly also been used by business owners to bring</v>

128
00:04:07.291 --> 00:04:08.580
<v Speaker 3>people to their stores.</v>

129
00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:10.050
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

130
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.333
<v Speaker 3>Say,</v>

131
00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.540
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

132
00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.410
<v Speaker 3>so this is the next level.</v>

133
00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:14.370
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>

134
00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.080
<v Speaker 3>this is what starts the next level,</v>

135
00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:17.100
<v Speaker 3>this kind of thing.</v>

136
00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:18.420
<v Speaker 3>The next level of</v>

137
00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.810
<v Speaker 1>Internet,</v>

138
00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:20.643
<v Speaker 1>augmented reality,</v>

139
00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:24.100
<v Speaker 1>it's going to take over and it's also scanning,</v>

140
00:04:24.101 --> 00:04:27.520
<v Speaker 1>just like snapchat scanned all our faces using all these filters now and they</v>

141
00:04:27.521 --> 00:04:28.150
<v Speaker 1>have perfect,</v>

142
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.550
<v Speaker 1>they could three d model all our faces now because we,</v>

143
00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.100
<v Speaker 1>we've been I her or faces now,</v>

144
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.560
<v Speaker 1>they ever,</v>

145
00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.650
<v Speaker 1>they're scanning the whole entire United States.</v>

146
00:04:35.651 --> 00:04:39.490
<v Speaker 1>They're going to have maps of everything inside and outside in like less than a</v>

147
00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.790
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

148
00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:40.061
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

149
00:04:40.061 --> 00:04:40.894
<v Speaker 3>do you think,</v>

150
00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.870
<v Speaker 3>didn't we think though that eventually that that was going to be inevitable and</v>

151
00:04:43.871 --> 00:04:45.070
<v Speaker 3>that was going to be unavoidable?</v>

152
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.700
<v Speaker 3>There's the technology's gonna dissolve all the windows.</v>

153
00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:49.001
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

154
00:04:49.001 --> 00:04:51.340
<v Speaker 3>this is the next is dissolving in the windows.</v>

155
00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:52.421
<v Speaker 3>No more curtains.</v>

156
00:04:52.421 --> 00:04:55.630
<v Speaker 3>That's also fascinating that it's an augmented reality.</v>

157
00:04:55.631 --> 00:04:55.900
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

158
00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.130
<v Speaker 3>that's what God,</v>

159
00:04:57.131 --> 00:04:58.440
<v Speaker 3>everybody in like that.</v>

160
00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.320
<v Speaker 3>The augmented reality is what snuck everybody in and then everybody's like,</v>

161
00:05:02.321 --> 00:05:02.891
<v Speaker 3>Oh man,</v>

162
00:05:02.891 --> 00:05:03.980
<v Speaker 3>let's play a game.</v>

163
00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.930
<v Speaker 3>And then you're completely sucked into this very bizarre new world where you're</v>

164
00:05:11.441 --> 00:05:15.280
<v Speaker 3>playing a game but wrapped around your own actual environment.</v>

165
00:05:15.281 --> 00:05:15.700
<v Speaker 3>What he's showing.</v>

166
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.270
<v Speaker 1>This guy owns the gym of that guy's house,</v>

167
00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:24.420
<v Speaker 1>so virtual owner of the property technically,</v>

168
00:05:24.521 --> 00:05:26.790
<v Speaker 1>and it can be Kenyan or stolen or taken her</v>

169
00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:27.713
<v Speaker 3>John.</v>

170
00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:28.910
<v Speaker 3>Woo Hoo.</v>

171
00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.930
<v Speaker 3>I met the owner of my gym.</v>

172
00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.883
<v Speaker 3>Nice guy.</v>

173
00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.113
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

174
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.741
<v Speaker 3>He's like a,</v>

175
00:05:34.741 --> 00:05:35.041
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

176
00:05:35.041 --> 00:05:36.690
<v Speaker 3>please don't tell anybody where I live,</v>

177
00:05:36.691 --> 00:05:37.020
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>

178
00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:38.170
<v Speaker 3>Get away from my apartment,</v>

179
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.600
<v Speaker 3>my house.</v>

180
00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.390
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

181
00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:40.290
<v Speaker 3>they're going to get sued.</v>

182
00:05:40.291 --> 00:05:42.450
<v Speaker 3>Those Pokemon people are going to get sued for sure.</v>

183
00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:45.480
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be a lot of lawsuits about this game.</v>

184
00:05:45.481 --> 00:05:46.860
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be a lot of people dying.</v>

185
00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:47.610
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

186
00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:48.900
<v Speaker 1>like I said on the way here,</v>

187
00:05:48.901 --> 00:05:51.950
<v Speaker 1>I saw somebody using it while driving because you,</v>

188
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:56.410
<v Speaker 1>do you think that dead body was somebody trying to get a water Pokemon invest</v>

189
00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:57.313
<v Speaker 1>and no,</v>

190
00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.500
<v Speaker 1>that dead body was probably somebody murdered or a homeless person.</v>

191
00:06:00.501 --> 00:06:01.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

192
00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean it doesn't have to be,</v>

193
00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:04.100
<v Speaker 1>but he could have been under that.</v>

194
00:06:04.101 --> 00:06:04.934
<v Speaker 1>Where's the water?</v>

195
00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:06.770
<v Speaker 1>Well there's some neat,</v>

196
00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:07.730
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

197
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:09.140
<v Speaker 1>When you find something,</v>

198
00:06:09.141 --> 00:06:10.530
<v Speaker 1>find like a water lord.</v>

199
00:06:10.531 --> 00:06:11.360
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it was?</v>

200
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.193
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

201
00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:12.841
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

202
00:06:12.841 --> 00:06:13.674
<v Speaker 1>it's an alert.</v>

203
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.190
<v Speaker 1>It's this thing that you can drop on the ground.</v>

204
00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.140
<v Speaker 1>And so did someone drop it where the home was,</v>

205
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:19.190
<v Speaker 1>where the dead person was?</v>

206
00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:19.611
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

207
00:06:19.611 --> 00:06:22.100
<v Speaker 1>she was just searching for Pokemon go.</v>

208
00:06:22.101 --> 00:06:22.640
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of,</v>

209
00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.270
<v Speaker 1>it reminds me of like when you're a kid,</v>

210
00:06:24.271 --> 00:06:27.200
<v Speaker 1>you know when your bicycle bicycle and you're going around in your neighborhood</v>

211
00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:28.190
<v Speaker 1>like playing adventure,</v>

212
00:06:28.191 --> 00:06:29.960
<v Speaker 1>like looking at things and finding things.</v>

213
00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:30.780
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of like that.</v>

214
00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:32.450
<v Speaker 1>They makes you kind of go out in your neighborhood.</v>

215
00:06:32.451 --> 00:06:33.650
<v Speaker 1>You look at stuff like,</v>

216
00:06:33.651 --> 00:06:36.530
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that there was like a Buddha across the street and like this</v>

217
00:06:36.531 --> 00:06:40.220
<v Speaker 1>forest by my house and I found out by this game cause it was like go here,</v>

218
00:06:40.221 --> 00:06:40.461
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

219
00:06:40.461 --> 00:06:41.960
<v Speaker 1>there's some stuff here.</v>

220
00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:45.650
<v Speaker 1>And so it's Kinda cool because it shows you around your neighborhood and stuff</v>

221
00:06:45.651 --> 00:06:47.330
<v Speaker 1>like that that you might've not known.</v>

222
00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.980
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of like that old game,</v>

223
00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:52.160
<v Speaker 1>that Geo tagging game that people used to play where it's like go to these</v>

224
00:06:52.161 --> 00:06:54.350
<v Speaker 1>coordinates and you'll find like a present.</v>

225
00:06:54.351 --> 00:06:57.850
<v Speaker 1>And you know if you got really cynical you'd be,</v>

226
00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:58.510
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

227
00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:01.730
<v Speaker 1>it's like some sort of an alien talking to you going move around your</v>

228
00:07:01.731 --> 00:07:03.800
<v Speaker 1>coordinates and take photographs of everything.</v>

229
00:07:03.801 --> 00:07:05.450
<v Speaker 1>So I can repeat it perfectly.</v>

230
00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:09.260
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting to see what businesses businesses are doing.</v>

231
00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:09.981
<v Speaker 1>Like dairy queen,</v>

232
00:07:09.981 --> 00:07:10.491
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

233
00:07:10.491 --> 00:07:14.390
<v Speaker 1>dropped something on the ground and it's like paying customers only can come</v>

234
00:07:14.391 --> 00:07:15.960
<v Speaker 1>here and get came on.</v>

235
00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:18.860
<v Speaker 1>So that's probably smart.</v>

236
00:07:18.861 --> 00:07:19.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

237
00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:20.030
<v Speaker 1>that's smart for them.</v>

238
00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:23.210
<v Speaker 1>Can you mad like I grew up in south Philly,</v>

239
00:07:23.211 --> 00:07:26.330
<v Speaker 1>we didn't look at anything and if we saw something we just kept walking.</v>

240
00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.820
<v Speaker 1>Well we don't have to do that anymore Eleanor.</v>

241
00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:30.530
<v Speaker 1>There's no more slaves.</v>

242
00:07:30.531 --> 00:07:34.250
<v Speaker 1>And now you don't have to ride a horse around taking pictures around my mom's</v>

243
00:07:34.251 --> 00:07:35.084
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood.</v>

244
00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:36.860
<v Speaker 1>So let me explain to me,</v>

245
00:07:36.861 --> 00:07:38.450
<v Speaker 1>cause let me understand how this works.</v>

246
00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:39.530
<v Speaker 1>You're playing it.</v>

247
00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:41.930
<v Speaker 1>So if you're playing it like what are you seeing right?</v>

248
00:07:41.931 --> 00:07:43.190
<v Speaker 1>You see on the ground right now?</v>

249
00:07:43.191 --> 00:07:45.050
<v Speaker 1>I see nothing I'm looking around.</v>

250
00:07:45.051 --> 00:07:47.270
<v Speaker 1>I could see down the street there's uh,</v>

251
00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:47.720
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

252
00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:51.080
<v Speaker 1>some cool places to get more coin or it's called pokey balls,</v>

253
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:52.250
<v Speaker 1>which you use to capture.</v>

254
00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:54.080
<v Speaker 1>These places exist.</v>

255
00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:55.510
<v Speaker 1>How they just like,</v>

256
00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:57.620
<v Speaker 1>they just decide that the things are there.</v>

257
00:07:57.621 --> 00:07:58.430
<v Speaker 1>It's random.</v>

258
00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:01.850
<v Speaker 1>But what they usually do is they take certain things in Google maps,</v>

259
00:08:01.851 --> 00:08:05.600
<v Speaker 1>like all their churches are gyms where you go to workout and stuff like that.</v>

260
00:08:05.601 --> 00:08:06.434
<v Speaker 1>Your pokemons.</v>

261
00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:07.580
<v Speaker 1>Then they take like,</v>

262
00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:11.780
<v Speaker 1>like things like the comedy store and they put certain like they know it's a</v>

263
00:08:11.781 --> 00:08:12.850
<v Speaker 1>landmark so they,</v>

264
00:08:12.851 --> 00:08:13.341
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

265
00:08:13.341 --> 00:08:14.840
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot going on there.</v>

266
00:08:14.841 --> 00:08:15.674
<v Speaker 1>Like last night,</v>

267
00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:16.850
<v Speaker 1>if you go to the comedy store now,</v>

268
00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:18.170
<v Speaker 1>you haven't been there in a couple of days.</v>

269
00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:19.550
<v Speaker 1>Every single person's playing,</v>

270
00:08:19.551 --> 00:08:20.600
<v Speaker 1>every single person working.</v>

271
00:08:20.601 --> 00:08:21.680
<v Speaker 1>There's playing every comic.</v>

272
00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:22.190
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

273
00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:23.780
<v Speaker 1>everyone's just out there on their phones.</v>

274
00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:25.680
<v Speaker 1>How this happens so quick,</v>

275
00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:26.260
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

276
00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:26.720
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

277
00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:27.800
<v Speaker 1>it's huge man.</v>

278
00:08:27.801 --> 00:08:28.150
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

279
00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:30.440
<v Speaker 1>I just heard about this like maybe two days ago,</v>

280
00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:33.530
<v Speaker 1>two days ago I saw a couple of pictures and April fool's joke</v>

281
00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:34.541
<v Speaker 2>on youtube,</v>

282
00:08:34.541 --> 00:08:38.280
<v Speaker 2>this video of what know someone made a fake application.</v>

283
00:08:38.281 --> 00:08:42.710
<v Speaker 2>I looked like this and it turned out to be a really good idea that someone took,</v>

284
00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:43.180
<v Speaker 2>develop,</v>

285
00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:43.460
<v Speaker 2>develop.</v>

286
00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:44.320
<v Speaker 2>It does now</v>

287
00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:45.850
<v Speaker 1>overnight.</v>

288
00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:49.100
<v Speaker 1>It's doing it because it really hits this nerve and your head of collecting</v>

289
00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:51.080
<v Speaker 1>things and when you're going like,</v>

290
00:08:51.081 --> 00:08:51.340
<v Speaker 1>look at,</v>

291
00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:51.940
<v Speaker 1>I've collected,</v>

292
00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:54.830
<v Speaker 1>w will look what I've collected and it's the perfect thing to do when you're</v>

293
00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:55.321
<v Speaker 1>bored.</v>

294
00:08:55.321 --> 00:08:56.460
<v Speaker 1>Like I was in an Uber.</v>

295
00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:58.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm just sitting there while we're driving by the Hollywood bowl.</v>

296
00:08:58.650 --> 00:08:58.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

297
00:08:58.890 --> 00:08:59.041
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

298
00:08:59.041 --> 00:09:00.180
<v Speaker 1>there's some cool stuff here.</v>

299
00:09:00.181 --> 00:09:01.014
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get here.</v>

300
00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:02.210
<v Speaker 1>So it's a good thing to do when you're,</v>

301
00:09:02.211 --> 00:09:03.340
<v Speaker 1>you have nothing else to do.</v>

302
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:06.060
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean get it as long as your phone?</v>

303
00:09:06.061 --> 00:09:08.130
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're collecting virtual items.</v>

304
00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:09.990
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're collecting virtual items.</v>

305
00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:11.310
<v Speaker 1>Like whoa.</v>

306
00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:16.850
<v Speaker 1>Pokemon chasing investors led oh 10 Nintendo's goal.</v>

307
00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:18.391
<v Speaker 1>Go out there and make,</v>

308
00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:19.224
<v Speaker 1>just make it smaller.</v>

309
00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:23.670
<v Speaker 1>Send in tendo shares soar and craze added 9 billion in market value.</v>

310
00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:24.910
<v Speaker 1>Two gave me company,</v>

311
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:27.000
<v Speaker 1>Nintendo was hurtin.</v>

312
00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:29.040
<v Speaker 1>Mathinna was hurting before this.</v>

313
00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:29.521
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

314
00:09:29.521 --> 00:09:30.840
<v Speaker 1>This is incredible.</v>

315
00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:31.780
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

316
00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:32.311
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

317
00:09:32.311 --> 00:09:34.320
<v Speaker 1>so you're walking around explaining this to me.</v>

318
00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:37.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at this person holding their hand and said they're walking around</v>

319
00:09:37.351 --> 00:09:40.980
<v Speaker 1>and they have like a phone open where the,</v>

320
00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:42.720
<v Speaker 1>they see the image of what's in front of them.</v>

321
00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:45.360
<v Speaker 1>But Pokemon stuff is just sort of floating around.</v>

322
00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:45.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

323
00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:46.711
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

324
00:09:46.711 --> 00:09:47.311
<v Speaker 1>this is crazy.</v>

325
00:09:47.311 --> 00:09:48.540
<v Speaker 1>And then you could grow eggs,</v>

326
00:09:48.541 --> 00:09:49.200
<v Speaker 1>you can share,</v>

327
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.070
<v Speaker 1>share are,</v>

328
00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:53.880
<v Speaker 1>you can train your characters to be stronger and then you can battle other</v>

329
00:09:53.881 --> 00:09:55.110
<v Speaker 1>characters at gyms.</v>

330
00:09:55.111 --> 00:09:55.281
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

331
00:09:55.281 --> 00:09:56.114
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

332
00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:57.510
<v Speaker 1>and this is by the way,</v>

333
00:09:57.511 --> 00:09:59.100
<v Speaker 1>is just the first version.</v>

334
00:09:59.101 --> 00:09:59.670
<v Speaker 1>They just,</v>

335
00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:00.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

336
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:00.330
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

337
00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:01.890
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be adding so much to this.</v>

338
00:10:01.891 --> 00:10:03.840
<v Speaker 1>And what's interesting to note,</v>

339
00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:08.160
<v Speaker 1>I heard a rumor maybe that the new grand theft auto is going to be doing the</v>

340
00:10:08.161 --> 00:10:08.994
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>

341
00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:11.640
<v Speaker 1>So you're going to be playing grand theft auto using Google maps.</v>

342
00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:13.980
<v Speaker 1>So you're going to be at your house and your house is going to be your house.</v>

343
00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:18.360
<v Speaker 1>And so this is just the beginning of this whole idea of taking Google's</v>

344
00:10:18.361 --> 00:10:18.961
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

345
00:10:18.961 --> 00:10:22.210
<v Speaker 1>And I think giving them the people outside one.</v>

346
00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:26.400
<v Speaker 1>One of the things is that they're already saying that people are are like kids</v>

347
00:10:26.401 --> 00:10:28.760
<v Speaker 1>are complaining about sore legs and like</v>

348
00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:36.300
<v Speaker 1>maybe this would be the video game that fixes fixes people who are addicted to</v>

349
00:10:36.301 --> 00:10:37.021
<v Speaker 1>video games.</v>

350
00:10:37.021 --> 00:10:37.854
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

351
00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:39.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's wow.</v>

352
00:10:39.301 --> 00:10:40.081
<v Speaker 1>Only positive thing.</v>

353
00:10:40.081 --> 00:10:41.440
<v Speaker 1>I see her,</v>

354
00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:43.320
<v Speaker 1>I'll just hanging around playing with each other.</v>

355
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:44.620
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

356
00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:45.510
<v Speaker 1>this is insane.</v>

357
00:10:45.511 --> 00:10:46.680
<v Speaker 1>This is like the comedy store lesson.</v>

358
00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:48.690
<v Speaker 1>Comicon in San Diego is going to be a zoo.</v>

359
00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:50.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

360
00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:53.610
<v Speaker 1>I forgot about stuff like that is fucking insane.</v>

361
00:10:53.611 --> 00:10:55.810
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe I just legs.</v>

362
00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:57.400
<v Speaker 1>Is that from being sore?</v>

363
00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:58.910
<v Speaker 1>That's like the Mother Teresa.</v>

364
00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:03.660
<v Speaker 1>I also heard that they banned it in San Francisco,</v>

365
00:11:03.661 --> 00:11:05.300
<v Speaker 1>but I haven't looked to see if that's true or not.</v>

366
00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:08.430
<v Speaker 1>Like some cities are actually banning it because people are not paying</v>

367
00:11:08.431 --> 00:11:08.911
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>

368
00:11:08.911 --> 00:11:13.800
<v Speaker 1>Just going into traffic and there was probably a lot of them on the four oh five</v>

369
00:11:13.801 --> 00:11:14.634
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

370
00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:15.481
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

371
00:11:15.481 --> 00:11:16.314
<v Speaker 1>I solved them.</v>

372
00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:17.400
<v Speaker 1>If you think about it,</v>

373
00:11:17.401 --> 00:11:21.900
<v Speaker 1>this is probably just the next step in what we're eventually going to get,</v>

374
00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:25.680
<v Speaker 1>which is some sort of a reality that we can manipulate all the time.</v>

375
00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:27.180
<v Speaker 1>Like this is one part of it.</v>

376
00:11:27.181 --> 00:11:29.280
<v Speaker 1>We're going to have a little games in the regular reality,</v>

377
00:11:29.281 --> 00:11:31.110
<v Speaker 1>but you could just have to look through your phone to see it.</v>

378
00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:33.180
<v Speaker 1>But how long before that's glasses that you're wearing?</v>

379
00:11:33.181 --> 00:11:34.830
<v Speaker 1>Like that Microsoft Shit?</v>

380
00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:36.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

381
00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:36.930
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

382
00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:37.741
<v Speaker 1>What is it called again?</v>

383
00:11:37.741 --> 00:11:38.574
<v Speaker 1>Magic leap.</v>

384
00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:39.841
<v Speaker 1>That's one.</v>

385
00:11:39.841 --> 00:11:41.000
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the Google one.</v>

386
00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:44.450
<v Speaker 1>Microsoft Hollow Lens is a,</v>

387
00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:46.590
<v Speaker 1>are they both with goggles?</v>

388
00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:48.150
<v Speaker 1>Both augmented reality bit there.</v>

389
00:11:48.151 --> 00:11:50.690
<v Speaker 1>Both developed around augmented reality supposedly magically leap.</v>

390
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:51.990
<v Speaker 1>It's supposed to be awesome.</v>

391
00:11:51.991 --> 00:11:53.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say so.</v>

392
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.250
<v Speaker 1>No one likes regular</v>

393
00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:54.791
<v Speaker 3>reality.</v>

394
00:11:54.791 --> 00:11:55.301
<v Speaker 3>Anyone come on.</v>

395
00:11:55.301 --> 00:11:56.800
<v Speaker 3>If you have a pair of glasses,</v>

396
00:11:56.830 --> 00:12:00.550
<v Speaker 3>if you just put on a pair of glasses that you put on a pair of like they live</v>

397
00:12:00.551 --> 00:12:01.030
<v Speaker 3>style,</v>

398
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:01.241
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

399
00:12:01.241 --> 00:12:01.841
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ,</v>

400
00:12:01.841 --> 00:12:03.040
<v Speaker 3>they live is going to be real.</v>

401
00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:07.960
<v Speaker 3>You put on a pair of glasses and then you see and you see all kinds of crazy</v>

402
00:12:07.961 --> 00:12:08.794
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

403
00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:18.350
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
