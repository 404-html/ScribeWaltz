<v Speaker 1>Tell them what happens when.</v>

22
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if we know those Jews.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know that when people masturbate,</v>

23
00:01:19.711 --> 00:01:23.400

<v Speaker 1>That's on top of you that you can't even</v>

24
00:01:23.401 --> 00:01:28.401
<v Speaker 1>see when you come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It comes into her belly and you have </v>

25
00:01:28.401 --> 00:01:30.291
<v Speaker 1>demon babies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only way to get the Jews out of my </v>

26
00:01:30.291 --> 00:01:32.781
<v Speaker 1>body as to jerk off Jews really bleeding</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the only way to get the juice out of</v>

27
00:01:33.001 --> 00:01:35.750
<v Speaker 1>your body is a jerk off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

28
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.760
<v Speaker 1>you have to get possessed by demons and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they swell up in my chest and they </v>

29
00:01:42.211 --> 00:01:46.620
<v Speaker 1>caused my penis to expand and to change </v>
<v Speaker 1>shape.</v>

30
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.800
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When inside of a shape,</v>

31
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.450
<v Speaker 1>it's very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen that comes like this.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Tape up marshmallow guy so you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>demons to sexy movie.</v>

33
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.670
<v Speaker 1>The only thing that gets the demon out </v>
<v Speaker 1>is if I jerk off a Semitic man,</v>

34
00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.170
<v Speaker 1>then when I do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see the demon come out of my penis in </v>

35
00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.600
<v Speaker 1>the form of this white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>salty substance.</v>

36
00:02:12.601 --> 00:02:16.350

56
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't know it that well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was still a ever evolving like </v>

57
00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:28.810
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Jarvis Jarvis,</v>

58
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.930
<v Speaker 1>Jarvis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just say the bits where like,</v>

59
00:03:31.931 --> 00:03:36.931
<v Speaker 1>I'm like cooling metal or cooling honey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was like real fluid and then as it</v>

60
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:42.270
<v Speaker 1>gets cooler it like more and more shape </v>
<v Speaker 1>until it becomes like the same thing </v>

61
00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.270
<v Speaker 1>every time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's cool.</v>

62
00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember that.</v>

63
00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.950
<v Speaker 1>I never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember total talent </v>

64
00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:46.950
<v Speaker 1>coordinator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You told me that.</v>

65
00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.980
<v Speaker 1>That's an interesting way to look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always felt that they grow though </v>

66
00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.100
<v Speaker 1>always felt that there are living thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it becomes sturdy.</v>

67
00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.920
<v Speaker 1>Like they started off as like little </v>
<v Speaker 1>saplings and they're like,</v>

68
00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.980
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes they look impressive and </v>

69
00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:58.980
<v Speaker 1>sometimes they come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they come out,</v>

70
00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:58.980
<v Speaker 1>they're fucking trees.</v>

71
00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.840
<v Speaker 1>There's certain bits that I've done that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're already a tree before they ever </v>

72
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:04.680
<v Speaker 1>got to the stage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the Vegan bit.</v>

73
00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.690
<v Speaker 1>That was just on my last special.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote that bit all after one </v>

74
00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:10.240
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you name that bit?</v>

75
00:04:10.241 --> 00:04:14.110
<v Speaker 1>Jamie Kilstein to Jv.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kelsey and Jamie Kilstein,</v>

76
00:04:14.111 --> 00:04:17.140
<v Speaker 1>believe it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though he talks a lot about being a</v>

77
00:04:17.141 --> 00:04:22.141
<v Speaker 1>Vegan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not preachy about it and he also </v>

78
00:04:22.141 --> 00:04:22.141
<v Speaker 1>admits it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He ate a lot of meat.</v>

79
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.540
<v Speaker 1>He's a bad example that Jamie Chelsea </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets a bad rap and part of it's because </v>

80
00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:28.840
<v Speaker 1>the conversation that he and I had on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the show,</v>

81
00:04:28.841 --> 00:04:32.410
<v Speaker 1>but he's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not a bad conversation.</v>

82
00:04:32.411 --> 00:04:33.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember if he's out there </v>
<v Speaker 1>listening.</v>

83
00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.270
<v Speaker 2>Jamie Kilstein.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're a good dude.</v>

84
00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.270
<v Speaker 2>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's a,</v>

85
00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.890
<v Speaker 2>he's a genuinely like what he's trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do.</v>

86
00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.940
<v Speaker 2>He genuinely thinks he's doing really </v>
<v Speaker 2>good things and he's just,</v>

87
00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.680
<v Speaker 2>it was about the um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Daniel Tosh rape thing.</v>

88
00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:54.290
<v Speaker 2>Daddy touched me that joke where he </v>
<v Speaker 2>asked the audience what they wanted to </v>

89
00:04:55.281 --> 00:05:00.281
<v Speaker 2>talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some guy yells out rape and Daniel Tosh </v>

90
00:05:00.281 --> 00:05:00.620
<v Speaker 2>start saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

91
00:05:00.621 --> 00:05:01.460
<v Speaker 2>what a great subject.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

92
00:05:01.461 --> 00:05:04.760
<v Speaker 2>what's so funny about rape is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the humiliation is the violence.</v>

93
00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.700
<v Speaker 2>Some woman says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>

94
00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.890
<v Speaker 2>nothing is funny about rape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>

95
00:05:09.891 --> 00:05:11.870
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't it be funny if five guys just </v>
<v Speaker 2>rape her right now?</v>

96
00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.740
<v Speaker 2>And it became this big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sent me.</v>

97
00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:15.320
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

98
00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.440
<v Speaker 2>that's the kind of shit that happens at </v>
<v Speaker 2>a goddamn comedy club.</v>

99
00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:19.820
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all know that.</v>

100
00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.350
<v Speaker 2>And the guy's just trying to be funny </v>
<v Speaker 2>while he's on his toes.</v>

101
00:05:24.351 --> 00:05:27.870
<v Speaker 2>On a stage in the spur of the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what to me it's like a non issue,</v>

102
00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:33.230
<v Speaker 2>so jamie and I disagreed with it heavily</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he felt like the lazy and he </v>

103
00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:34.880
<v Speaker 2>felt like your contributed to rape </v>
<v Speaker 2>culture,</v>

104
00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:38.820
<v Speaker 2>which is a term that gets bandied about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a.</v>

105
00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:42.560
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird term.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people think it's horse shit term,</v>

106
00:05:42.561 --> 00:05:44.150
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is no rape culture.</v>

107
00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:49.550
<v Speaker 1>The real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why if you say the Indian comics </v>

108
00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.640
<v Speaker 1>from India and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're super rape joke.</v>

109
00:05:49.641 --> 00:05:52.710
<v Speaker 1>He comes out and they're consistent gang</v>
<v Speaker 1>rapes.</v>

110
00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:53.590
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all.</v>

111
00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:58.690
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty much all our comics just </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about rape and gang rape and then </v>

112
00:05:58.690 --> 00:05:58.690
<v Speaker 1>it</v>

113
00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:03.250
<v Speaker 3>really in the ecommerce peters from </v>
<v Speaker 3>Houston,</v>

114
00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.920
<v Speaker 3>they're Indians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're brown is fuck barrier.</v>

115
00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:18.020
<v Speaker 3>Our Indian garment for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>until they have a seat stay.</v>

116
00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:23.380
<v Speaker 3>There's giant movie industry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their movie industry is bigger than our </v>

117
00:06:24.321 --> 00:06:25.790
<v Speaker 3>movie and Super Porny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

118
00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:31.080
<v Speaker 3>It's not always long sex scenes and </v>
<v Speaker 3>those considered juggling a fruit and </v>

119
00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:35.231
<v Speaker 3>singing in between a gun fighting movies</v>
<v Speaker 3>still have a musical numbers where they </v>

120
00:06:37.701 --> 00:06:40.070
<v Speaker 3>will start in the middle of a real </v>
<v Speaker 3>action movie.</v>

121
00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:45.250
<v Speaker 3>When I went to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we would take volume and go to this </v>

122
00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:49.421
<v Speaker 3>movie theater in New Delhi and just </v>
<v Speaker 3>watch their movies because there's so </v>

123
00:06:49.421 --> 00:06:49.421
<v Speaker 3>trippy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

124
00:06:49.421 --> 00:06:51.360
<v Speaker 3>in the middle of like an action movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

125
00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:56.210
<v Speaker 3>it'll stop and do a musical number that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a real serious action movie.</v>

126
00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:58.550
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just their culture did like it.</v>

127
00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:03.640
<v Speaker 3>They like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They like that style of to will mean we </v>

128
00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:03.640
<v Speaker 3>used to like it.</v>

129
00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:05.780
<v Speaker 3>And if you go back and try to watch </v>
<v Speaker 3>those old Oklahoma,</v>

130
00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:08.270
<v Speaker 3>well all those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like gene Kelly movies,</v>

131
00:07:08.271 --> 00:07:13.271
<v Speaker 3>there was start dancing in the streets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he would stand there and people </v>

132
00:07:13.271 --> 00:07:16.361
<v Speaker 3>would dance around them and they had </v>
<v Speaker 3>music videos at broke out in the middle </v>

133
00:07:16.361 --> 00:07:17.330
<v Speaker 3>of a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they have also applied to put it.</v>

134
00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:18.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have all these plots.</v>

135
00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:22.010
<v Speaker 3>They have real language.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're real dialogue.</v>

136
00:07:22.011 --> 00:07:27.011
<v Speaker 3>They have a real storyline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see like why there wouldn't be </v>

137
00:07:27.011 --> 00:07:31.521
<v Speaker 3>singing about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

138
00:07:32.901 --> 00:07:36.260
<v Speaker 3>it's someone's desire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the one person's desire in the middle of</v>

139
00:07:36.261 --> 00:07:38.630
<v Speaker 3>a gigantic performance where people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>interacting with each other.</v>

140
00:07:38.631 --> 00:07:41.390
<v Speaker 3>It's one person's desire to totally </v>
<v Speaker 3>steal the spotlight.</v>

141
00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:46.720
<v Speaker 3>And the best way to do that is by saying</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody has to stand around and listen</v>

142
00:07:47.601 --> 00:07:50.000
<v Speaker 3>while John,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we're all like support.</v>

143
00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:53.010
<v Speaker 3>We're in the back and John's in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>century snapping.</v>

144
00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:58.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's got this great point and we're </v>

145
00:07:58.110 --> 00:07:58.110
<v Speaker 3>all like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

146
00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:01.151
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>senior angle above live and everyone's </v>

147
00:08:01.151 --> 00:08:03.830
<v Speaker 3>letting him move around and nobody stops</v>
<v Speaker 3>and go,</v>

148
00:08:03.831 --> 00:08:08.831
<v Speaker 3>what are you fucking doing man?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like why are you saying like nobody </v>

149
00:08:08.831 --> 00:08:08.831
<v Speaker 3>interacts with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no interacting.</v>

150
00:08:08.831 --> 00:08:12.470
<v Speaker 3>It's just this one guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what the theater to some folks.</v>

151
00:08:12.471 --> 00:08:15.700
<v Speaker 3>It's all about that moment on stage </v>
<v Speaker 3>holding the stoll.</v>

152
00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:18.710
<v Speaker 3>Who Got Paul?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Reminds me,</v>

153
00:08:18.711 --> 00:08:20.450
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got a million dollar idea.</v>

154
00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:24.620
<v Speaker 3>What's a found footage musical like this</v>
<v Speaker 3>found footage?</v>

155
00:08:24.621 --> 00:08:29.621
<v Speaker 3>Movies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they find one where like people are </v>

156
00:08:29.621 --> 00:08:31.901
<v Speaker 3>actually real music.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

157
00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:35.650
<v Speaker 3>music is playing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just start saying,</v>

158
00:08:35.651 --> 00:08:36.250
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what?</v>

159
00:08:36.251 --> 00:08:40.160
<v Speaker 3>The flare.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That will be great.</v>

160
00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:44.360
<v Speaker 3>Really bad songs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But Linda's choppy video,</v>

161
00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:47.720
<v Speaker 3>it's totally happening right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got another.</v>

162
00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:52.780
<v Speaker 3>I've got a great idea to do with it of </v>
<v Speaker 3>an improvised musical reality show,</v>

163
00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:56.240
<v Speaker 3>but they gotta</v>

164
00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:57.570
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a great idea.</v>

165
00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:02.880
<v Speaker 2>That's a great idea to bring them into a</v>
<v Speaker 2>situation and the audience doesn't know,</v>

166
00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:09.770
<v Speaker 2>so they have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're are people going to interact </v>

167
00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:11.270
<v Speaker 2>with them to sing out to this restaurant</v>
<v Speaker 2>or bar?</v>

168
00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:16.850
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever seen the video?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a video with this bringing you </v>

169
00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:18.480
<v Speaker 2>back to a activists that get that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes ms dot point.</v>

170
00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:23.750
<v Speaker 2>There was a video of this lady,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she steps into a chicken restaurant and </v>

171
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:24.900
<v Speaker 2>she starts talking about this is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>food,</v>

172
00:09:24.901 --> 00:09:26.740
<v Speaker 2>this is violence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

173
00:09:26.741 --> 00:09:30.990
<v Speaker 2>and there's a little girl and her saying</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she just wants to live.</v>

174
00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:36.140
<v Speaker 2>She just wants to be happy and she just </v>
<v Speaker 2>wants to live and this little girl was </v>

175
00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:40.011
<v Speaker 2>going to die just like all of her </v>
<v Speaker 2>sisters and all of her brothers and her </v>

176
00:09:40.011 --> 00:09:41.820
<v Speaker 2>family chicken a chicken and she rescued</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

177
00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:46.880
<v Speaker 2>this chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so she just like videos of the same </v>

178
00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.060
<v Speaker 2>gal with her chicken at home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

179
00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:48.560
<v Speaker 2>it's like.</v>

180
00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:54.270
<v Speaker 2>So she goes into a restaurant and </v>
<v Speaker 2>disrupts all these people and like tells</v>

181
00:09:54.271 --> 00:09:59.271
<v Speaker 2>this whole story and then explains that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hurt our chicken and then a whole </v>

182
00:09:59.271 --> 00:10:01.260
<v Speaker 2>crew of assholes come in behind her with</v>
<v Speaker 2>signs.</v>

183
00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:03.840
<v Speaker 2>This is not food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's violence.</v>

184
00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:06.280
<v Speaker 2>It's so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>

185
00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:09.540
<v Speaker 2>we're just running a restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did it seems like a parody.</v>

186
00:10:09.541 --> 00:10:14.541
<v Speaker 2>It seems like someone is just bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some Tim and Eric type dude really just </v>

187
00:10:14.541 --> 00:10:16.680
<v Speaker 2>put together some bad ass parody that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>so subtle.</v>

188
00:10:16.681 --> 00:10:21.681
<v Speaker 2>You like not sure like is this bitch </v>
<v Speaker 2>really this crazy that she's referring </v>

189
00:10:21.681 --> 00:10:22.770
<v Speaker 2>to this chicken as her girl?</v>

190
00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:28.170
<v Speaker 4>So it seems sometimes that like </v>
<v Speaker 4>activists aren't aware of the fact that </v>

191
00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:32.270
<v Speaker 4>if they're stumped isn't pulled off in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the right way.</v>

192
00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:36.440
<v Speaker 4>It seems like it could be more </v>
<v Speaker 4>detrimental comes off course,</v>

193
00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:37.670
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like people will,</v>

194
00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:42.820
<v Speaker 4>their response is going to be too rude </v>
<v Speaker 4>to eat more chicken people.</v>

195
00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:44.180
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just because you're like,</v>

196
00:10:44.181 --> 00:10:49.181
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to be associated with this </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of behavior and if that means </v>

197
00:10:49.181 --> 00:10:51.530
<v Speaker 4>eating chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then I guess I'll eat more chicken.</v>

198
00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:56.980
<v Speaker 4>So it's like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's dangerous to be an activist if you </v>

199
00:10:57.111 --> 00:11:01.370
<v Speaker 4>are not really subtle or if you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>aren't skillful in what you're doing.</v>

200
00:11:01.371 --> 00:11:04.430
<v Speaker 4>Like being an activist is awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just make sure that you're graceful when</v>

201
00:11:04.431 --> 00:11:04.910
<v Speaker 4>you do it</v>

202
00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:05.780
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>

203
00:11:05.781 --> 00:11:10.781
<v Speaker 2>you have to have a real objective sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>of what actions you're putting out there</v>

204
00:11:11.091 --> 00:11:13.310
<v Speaker 2>and how those actions are going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>perceived.</v>

205
00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:16.040
<v Speaker 2>If you fake it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see through and it seems lame.</v>

206
00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:21.070
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some people that have this idea </v>

207
00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:22.541
<v Speaker 2>that their idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they're protesting against is more </v>

208
00:11:22.541 --> 00:11:24.990
<v Speaker 2>important than anything that's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>disrupt anything that's going to involve</v>

209
00:11:24.991 --> 00:11:29.991
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Greenpeace Greenpeace did with the </v>

210
00:11:29.991 --> 00:11:29.991
<v Speaker 2>Nazca lines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

211
00:11:29.991 --> 00:11:33.500
<v Speaker 2>They fucked him up so fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's dumb ass holes.</v>

212
00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:36.380
<v Speaker 2>Went to the Nazca lines and they set up </v>
<v Speaker 2>a graph,</v>

213
00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:37.830
<v Speaker 2>looks unethical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nazca lines.</v>

214
00:11:37.831 --> 00:11:40.100
<v Speaker 2>So these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't even know how old they are.</v>

215
00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:42.140
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are thousands of years old.</v>

216
00:11:42.141 --> 00:11:43.850
<v Speaker 2>These law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile I'm like,</v>

217
00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:48.920
<v Speaker 2>because we know how old they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just revealed that you're an </v>

218
00:11:49.071 --> 00:11:54.071
<v Speaker 2>immortal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've dated more than a thousand </v>

219
00:11:54.071 --> 00:11:54.071
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever it is.</v>

220
00:11:54.071 --> 00:11:54.160
<v Speaker 2>They're all sorts</v>

221
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.590
<v Speaker 1>of geometric patterns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals,</v>

222
00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:59.050
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them are animals,</v>

223
00:11:59.051 --> 00:12:02.290
<v Speaker 1>some of them are spiders were all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>weird patterns you can only see from the</v>

224
00:12:02.291 --> 00:12:03.790
<v Speaker 1>sky patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

225
00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:08.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there are patterns that are in their </v>

226
00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:11.780
<v Speaker 1>patterns are made on these flat plains </v>
<v Speaker 1>and some of them are just a bunch of </v>

227
00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:15.931
<v Speaker 1>rocks that are pieced together in these </v>
<v Speaker 1>lines and people have left them </v>

228
00:12:15.931 --> 00:12:19.030
<v Speaker 1>undisturbed because they're so cool </v>
<v Speaker 1>forever.</v>

229
00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:22.000
<v Speaker 1>So you can't just go there and walk </v>
<v Speaker 1>around on them.</v>

230
00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:27.030
<v Speaker 1>You can't fuck these assholes went there</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they use some of the stones as </v>

231
00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:31.440
<v Speaker 1>paperweights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They pick some of the rocks on the </v>

232
00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:34.191
<v Speaker 1>ground or they go to sign up this </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking stupid green peace sign.</v>

233
00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:35.610
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>does is really good,</v>

238
00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:48.940
<v Speaker 1>which stop people from killing whales.</v>

242
00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:02.780
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see how cool that that design is,</v>

243
00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:05.060
<v Speaker 1>that pattern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that pattern has been there for.</v>

244
00:13:05.061 --> 00:13:06.720
<v Speaker 1>That just naturally happened in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

245
00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:08.600
<v Speaker 1>Oh right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were,</v>

246
00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:13.660
<v Speaker 1>they were using stones from that to put </v>
<v Speaker 1>their sign with the,</v>

247
00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:16.220
<v Speaker 1>with the foot thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they weren't disturbing people.</v>

248
00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:19.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the fuck they think </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing.</v>

249
00:13:19.191 --> 00:13:21.620
<v Speaker 1>They're still disturbing it by doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

250
00:13:21.621 --> 00:13:23.390
<v Speaker 1>Like sometimes standing on that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

251
00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:25.790
<v Speaker 1>you're fucking footprints are also in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that paper.</v>

252
00:13:25.791 --> 00:13:28.100
<v Speaker 1>I could see the bottom of your tread.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what that means.</v>

253
00:13:28.101 --> 00:13:29.990
<v Speaker 1>That means you stand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You stood on that shit.</v>

254
00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:35.620
<v Speaker 1>You stood on that shit somewhere and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to believe that you're doing </v>

255
00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:36.530
<v Speaker 1>this all ethically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not fighting fire.</v>

256
00:13:36.531 --> 00:13:38.120
<v Speaker 1>They shouldn't have done that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It backfired.</v>

257
00:13:38.121 --> 00:13:43.121
<v Speaker 1>And that sucks because all the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who are doing good work look like </v>

258
00:13:43.121 --> 00:13:44.270
<v Speaker 1>assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

259
00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:46.130
<v Speaker 1>That sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

260
00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:47.120
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

261
00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:52.180
<v Speaker 1>So this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the actual of those are the </v>

262
00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:52.240
<v Speaker 1>lines like that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

263
00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:53.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What makes them.</v>

264
00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:55.910
<v Speaker 1>We don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't know who made them.</v>

265
00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:59.780
<v Speaker 1>They really don't know that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

266
00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:00.740
<v Speaker 1>That kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not,</v>

267
00:14:00.741 --> 00:14:03.710
<v Speaker 1>that's not just like movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a kinetic movement.</v>

268
00:14:03.711 --> 00:14:04.670
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

269
00:14:04.671 --> 00:14:05.120
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

270
00:14:05.121 --> 00:14:05.540
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

271
00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:07.580
<v Speaker 1>These are mad that someone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Definitely.</v>

272
00:14:07.581 --> 00:14:08.750
<v Speaker 1>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Without a doubt.</v>

273
00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:13.550
<v Speaker 1>Is that in sand or is that in stone?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is so funny.</v>

274
00:14:13.551 --> 00:14:18.551
<v Speaker 1>Some people think that the geometric </v>
<v Speaker 1>ones could be indicated flow of water </v>

275
00:14:18.551 --> 00:14:20.450
<v Speaker 1>that's connected to rituals to summon </v>
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>

276
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:21.920
<v Speaker 1>Spiders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>birds,</v>

277
00:14:21.921 --> 00:14:23.810
<v Speaker 1>plants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could be fertility symbols.</v>

278
00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:28.910
<v Speaker 1>Other possible explanations include a </v>
<v Speaker 1>irrigation schemes or giant astronomical</v>

279
00:14:28.911 --> 00:14:33.911
<v Speaker 1>calendars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why isn't everyone trying to figure it </v>

280
00:14:33.911 --> 00:14:33.911
<v Speaker 1>out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That looks like a bird.</v>

281
00:14:33.911 --> 00:14:33.911
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well they're definitely trying to figure</v>

282
00:14:33.911 --> 00:14:34.460
<v Speaker 1>it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a dog.</v>

288
00:14:46.561 --> 00:14:47.880

<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

295
00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:08.020
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember when they used to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that with a.</v>

296
00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:10.930
<v Speaker 1>whether they would code certain words in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the websites.</v>

297

<v Speaker 1>everybody says it's an alien.</v>

304
00:15:27.741 --> 00:15:28.880
<v Speaker 1>It's an alien.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

305
00:15:28.881 --> 00:15:33.260
<v Speaker 1>maybe maybe somebody might be a giant </v>
<v Speaker 1>two year old,</v>

306
00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:38.530
<v Speaker 1>might be really shitty artists for </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years.</v>

307
00:15:38.661 --> 00:15:40.310
<v Speaker 1>The shitty artists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the jetty.</v>

308
00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:43.150

<v Speaker 1>dude who was trying to tell me,</v>

309
00:15:43.151 --> 00:15:45.470
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these images on cave walls,</v>

310

<v Speaker 1>valence like Graham Hancock,</v>

313
00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:51.350
<v Speaker 1>who I love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>come on man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might not be an alien.</v>

315
00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:54.980
<v Speaker 1>That can be a lot of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These people,</v>

316
00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:57.470
<v Speaker 1>if they want to believe in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not only that,</v>

317
00:15:57.471 --> 00:16:02.471
<v Speaker 1>but it was thousands of years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just what they saw back then was aliens.</v>

318
00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:08.000
<v Speaker 1>That's when they pull up the monkey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>

319
00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:13.360
<v Speaker 1>and you just see this monkey see monkey </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's really cool.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's got a curly tail is go down a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit,</v>

321
00:16:15.741 --> 00:16:17.990
<v Speaker 1>go down a little bit more and more and </v>
<v Speaker 1>more and more and more and more.</v>

322
00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:21.210
<v Speaker 3>Start up a little up.</v>

<v Speaker 1>We got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's gone.</v>

324
00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:25.890
<v Speaker 1>It was a dog to the left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you see that?</v>

325
00:16:25.891 --> 00:16:26.910
<v Speaker 1>One of the far left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>

326
00:16:26.911 --> 00:16:28.620
<v Speaker 1>About three down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

327
00:16:28.621 --> 00:16:30.870
<v Speaker 1>it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just let's try to find a monkey.</v>

328
00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:35.390
<v Speaker 1>Whereas that monkey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's the fucking monkey?</v>

329
00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:37.680
<v Speaker 1>The monkey from us?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

330
00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:39.990
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go to the Wikipedia,</v>

331
00:16:39.991 --> 00:16:43.090
<v Speaker 1>you could see the month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the cool.</v>

332
00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:48.230
<v Speaker 1>Here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like it's puking or it's on the </v>

333
00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:49.230
<v Speaker 1>wikipedia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you go to the Wikipedia,</v>

334
00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:50.410
<v Speaker 1>look at them like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

335
00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:53.930
<v Speaker 1>that'll look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see it there.</v>

336
00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:58.080
<v Speaker 1>It's enormous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How big is a person to toe?</v>

337
00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:00.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.</v>

338
00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:03.480
<v Speaker 1>That's a very good question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're really big.</v>

339
00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:08.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see when those people were walking </v>

340
00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:08.840
<v Speaker 1>around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean digitally,</v>

341
00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:13.050
<v Speaker 1>they were laying that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like it was drawn like with a </v>

342
00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:16.011
<v Speaker 1>finger on a tablet or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't look like a shit ton of </v>

343
00:17:16.011 --> 00:17:18.720
<v Speaker 1>people spend a long time look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The tail kind of wore out.</v>

344
00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:21.450
<v Speaker 1>They've had some damage with mud slugs </v>
<v Speaker 1>to apparently.</v>

345
00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:23.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they.</v>

346
00:17:23.281 --> 00:17:24.330
<v Speaker 1>But they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they really.</v>

347
00:17:24.331 --> 00:17:27.090
<v Speaker 1>There's all sorts of explanations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nobody goes there.</v>

348
00:17:27.091 --> 00:17:30.190
<v Speaker 1>They just look at it and then the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Greenpeace people want.</v>

349
00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:33.870
<v Speaker 1>They're aliens came,</v>
<v Speaker 1>visited these people,</v>

350
00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:36.450
<v Speaker 1>gave them like showed them some </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible shit.</v>

351
00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:39.420
<v Speaker 1>They left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people want them to come back.</v>

352
00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:43.220
<v Speaker 1>So they draw these shapes on the ground </v>
<v Speaker 1>and hoping that our attorney,</v>

353
00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:46.890
<v Speaker 1>it's classic cargo cult behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where it all is right in the same</v>

354
00:17:46.891 --> 00:17:48.550
<v Speaker 1>place in Peru.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

355
00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:49.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This one area,</v>

356
00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:55.580
<v Speaker 2>it's really fascinating also because </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's what looked like landing strips </v>

357
00:17:55.801 --> 00:17:59.550
<v Speaker 2>there as long parallel lines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want them to come back.</v>

358
00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:00.870
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's got to be.</v>

359
00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:04.490
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't have to be.</v>

360
00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:06.090
<v Speaker 2>It could be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just know.</v>

361
00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:11.350
<v Speaker 2>They just figured out how to draw it in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ground that you can see from the </v>

362
00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:13.741
<v Speaker 2>sky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they just thought it was an </v>

363
00:18:13.741 --> 00:18:13.741
<v Speaker 2>interesting way to do something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they couldn't see your will.</v>

364
00:18:13.741 --> 00:18:15.930
<v Speaker 2>They could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just couldn't see it really well,</v>

365
00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:18.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can only really truly see what it is</v>

366
00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:22.110
<v Speaker 2>when you're up above it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean it's not impossible that they</v>

367
00:18:22.111 --> 00:18:23.880
<v Speaker 2>could measure it and do it all on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ground.</v>

368
00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:26.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm just proposing being the devil's </v>
<v Speaker 2>advocate,</v>

369
00:18:26.791 --> 00:18:28.800
<v Speaker 2>like it's not impossible that they did </v>
<v Speaker 2>those.</v>

370
00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:30.750
<v Speaker 2>You could see the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

371
00:18:30.751 --> 00:18:32.100
<v Speaker 2>you're looking down at your feet.</v>

372
00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:35.170
<v Speaker 2>It's not like you're invisible to you to</v>
<v Speaker 2>help.</v>

373
00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:40.090
<v Speaker 2>You do like 12 mile wide monkey sabic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not that big.</v>

374
00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:44.130
<v Speaker 2>They're not that big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're a few hundred feet wide.</v>

375
00:18:44.131 --> 00:18:49.131
<v Speaker 2>I think the really big ones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's not like 12 miles long or </v>

376
00:18:49.131 --> 00:18:51.711
<v Speaker 2>anything crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I do it the lines themselves or </v>

377
00:18:51.711 --> 00:18:55.450
<v Speaker 2>they're superficial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're only 10 to 30 centimeters deep </v>

378
00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:58.820
<v Speaker 2>and could be washed away really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's why nobody goes there because </v>

379
00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:02.541
<v Speaker 2>I'll wear it down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's only ever received a very small </v>

380
00:19:02.541 --> 00:19:05.241
<v Speaker 2>amount of rain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's issues also that the great </v>

381
00:19:05.241 --> 00:19:06.930
<v Speaker 2>changes that we're seeing to the climate</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it might start raining.</v>

382
00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:12.190
<v Speaker 2>They're not fucked crops.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

383
00:19:12.191 --> 00:19:17.191
<v Speaker 2>at least you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's like really hooked up crops </v>

384
00:19:17.191 --> 00:19:20.920
<v Speaker 2>ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but everyone will be better than the </v>

385
00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:20.920
<v Speaker 2>stupid lines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

386
00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:24.060
<v Speaker 2>But everybody's really localized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have it in their head that,</v>

387
00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:25.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

388
00:19:25.081 --> 00:19:26.970
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this site is like,</v>

389
00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:28.710
<v Speaker 2>it's super important.</v>

390
00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:31.230
<v Speaker 2>But we have all the images,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like once we have the images,</v>

391
00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:33.450
<v Speaker 2>if the water comes in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>washed everything away,</v>

392
00:19:33.451 --> 00:19:37.470
<v Speaker 2>at least at least we've documented.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know these people made these things.</v>

393
00:19:37.471 --> 00:19:42.471
<v Speaker 2>We don't know why or when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they think it's the nascar </v>

394
00:19:42.471 --> 00:19:42.471
<v Speaker 2>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is like,</v>

395
00:19:42.471 --> 00:19:45.100
<v Speaker 2>I think it said here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>400 to 650 add.</v>

396
00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:48.870
<v Speaker 2>So they lived there and maybe carve </v>
<v Speaker 2>those things they think.</v>

397
00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:51.290
<v Speaker 2>So that's over a thousand years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

398
00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:53.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more than it as,</v>

399
00:19:53.301 --> 00:19:56.820
<v Speaker 2>as much as 1500 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go to work and show it could be longer.</v>

400
00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.000
<v Speaker 2>Crazy shit man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't really have any explanation </v>

401
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:02.640
<v Speaker 2>for why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's a lot of.</v>

402
00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:03.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could,</v>

403
00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:04.320
<v Speaker 2>it could be aliens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

404
00:20:04.321 --> 00:20:06.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean if we can go to Mars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

405
00:20:06.511 --> 00:20:07.920
<v Speaker 2>we can send a robot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tomorrow's.</v>

406
00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:11.400
<v Speaker 2>It's so arrogant to think that we're the</v>
<v Speaker 2>only ones that could do that.</v>

407
00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:16.430
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen any evidence whatsoever </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's even remotely compelling that </v>

408
00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:17.250
<v Speaker 2>aliens have visited here.</v>

409
00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:18.690
<v Speaker 2>None of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None of it.</v>

410
00:20:18.691 --> 00:20:23.040
<v Speaker 2>That's outside of other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not one thing that stands out.</v>

411
00:20:23.041 --> 00:20:28.041
<v Speaker 2>We say that had to be aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It couldn't have just been really smart </v>

412
00:20:28.041 --> 00:20:31.161
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now one thing and why would any of them </v>

413
00:20:31.161 --> 00:20:31.161
<v Speaker 2>left anything?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

414
00:20:31.161 --> 00:20:31.600
<v Speaker 2>it might've.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might've when,</v>

415
00:20:31.601 --> 00:20:36.090
<v Speaker 2>when we're looking at the pyramids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we might be looking at is someone's</v>

416
00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:38.910
<v Speaker 2>knowledge and information from another </v>
<v Speaker 2>culture.</v>

417
00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:42.750
<v Speaker 2>Well done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The pyramids somehow point to serious,</v>

418
00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:44.550
<v Speaker 2>serious sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of.</v>

419
00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:49.610
<v Speaker 2>Well it depends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said there's a thing called the </v>

420
00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:49.610
<v Speaker 2>procession of the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the earth spins.</v>

421
00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:49.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

422
00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:50.190
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

423
00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:55.200
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's like a wobble to the earth and </v>

424
00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:55.200
<v Speaker 2>so when you see this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the stars,</v>

425
00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:58.010
<v Speaker 2>it's not always the same and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wobbles like,</v>

426
00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:00.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every x amount of thousands of years.</v>

427
00:21:00.311 --> 00:21:04.480
<v Speaker 2>So depending upon where you think these </v>
<v Speaker 2>were constructed,</v>

428
00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:06.410
<v Speaker 2>you would have a different star line.</v>

429
00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:08.080
<v Speaker 2>You'd have a different thing that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>would see.</v>

430
00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:13.030
<v Speaker 2>There is a guy named John Anthony West </v>
<v Speaker 2>who's just amazing when it comes to this</v>

431
00:21:13.031 --> 00:21:15.220
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his whole video series.</v>

432
00:21:15.221 --> 00:21:18.640
<v Speaker 2>It's called magical Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So good if you've never been.</v>

433
00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:21.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like if you're not even </v>
<v Speaker 2>interested at all in Egypt,</v>

434
00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:21.730
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

435
00:21:21.731 --> 00:21:26.731
<v Speaker 2>that's fucking boring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bunch of people living in the sand like </v>

436
00:21:26.731 --> 00:21:27.850
<v Speaker 2>assholes if you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want one of these videos.</v>

437
00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:33.600
<v Speaker 2>I would love it if I was high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just trying to be funny.</v>

438
00:21:33.821 --> 00:21:35.270
<v Speaker 2>I would say that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

439
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:41.000
<v Speaker 2>his videos are super in depth about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>construction methods and how big it is </v>

440
00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:45.760
<v Speaker 2>and like all the magical things about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way they built them,</v>

441
00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:49.990
<v Speaker 2>they think that it was a culture that </v>
<v Speaker 2>lived a long fucking time before.</v>

442
00:21:49.991 --> 00:21:52.910
<v Speaker 2>We think not just like $2,500</v>
<v Speaker 2>per se,</v>

443
00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:54.630
<v Speaker 2>but like he's of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

444
00:21:54.631 --> 00:21:56.920
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the notion that it's like 10,000</v>

445
00:21:56.921 --> 00:22:01.921
<v Speaker 2>plus BC and if you go to 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>BC apparently where the lion is a </v>

446
00:22:02.381 --> 00:22:07.381
<v Speaker 2>sphinx,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where it's pointing would be directly </v>

447
00:22:07.381 --> 00:22:07.381
<v Speaker 2>over the Constellation Leo.</v>

448
00:22:07.381 --> 00:22:09.510
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like the serious theory.</v>

449
00:22:09.511 --> 00:22:13.800
<v Speaker 4>Better the dog star.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like Robert Anton Wilson.</v>

450
00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:15.600
<v Speaker 4>Crazy idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

451
00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:21.440
<v Speaker 4>that we are possibly currently existing </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the serious star cluster in what </v>

452
00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:31.370
<v Speaker 4>we're having this experience of reality </v>
<v Speaker 4>pumped into our consciousness as a form </v>

453
00:22:31.591 --> 00:22:35.160
<v Speaker 4>of training for something like Matrix </v>
<v Speaker 4>pods,</v>

454
00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:37.650
<v Speaker 4>pods,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that there is like,</v>

455
00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:42.800
<v Speaker 4>so there's like clues left in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>simulator pointing back home and just to</v>

456
00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:46.110
<v Speaker 4>just as a little cookie like you even </v>
<v Speaker 4>video games,</v>

457
00:22:46.111 --> 00:22:51.111
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or maybe people a long time ago or more </v>

458
00:22:51.111 --> 00:22:54.261
<v Speaker 4>aware of the fact that this is a inner </v>
<v Speaker 4>interdimensional academy at kind of </v>

459
00:22:54.601 --> 00:22:58.710
<v Speaker 4>hogwarts for young God links who are </v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to like,</v>

460
00:22:58.711 --> 00:23:01.650
<v Speaker 4>who have the potential to become like </v>
<v Speaker 4>universe creators.</v>

461
00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:05.340
<v Speaker 4>But before they're elise to like create </v>
<v Speaker 4>their own dimensions.</v>

462
00:23:05.341 --> 00:23:09.240
<v Speaker 4>They have to go through this infinite </v>
<v Speaker 4>loop again and again and again until you</v>

463
00:23:09.241 --> 00:23:14.241
<v Speaker 4>learn that the most important thing is </v>
<v Speaker 4>to love the people around you more than </v>

464
00:23:14.241 --> 00:23:14.241
<v Speaker 4>you love yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then boom,</v>

465
00:23:14.241 --> 00:23:15.960
<v Speaker 4>and then you can be a god.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

466
00:23:15.961 --> 00:23:20.961
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you can then we can trust you to </v>

467
00:23:20.961 --> 00:23:20.961
<v Speaker 4>fuck around with like our black hole </v>
<v Speaker 4>machine or whatever.</v>

468
00:23:20.961 --> 00:23:25.760
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to put you in charge of </v>
<v Speaker 4>black holes while you're a selfish </v>

469
00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:26.030
<v Speaker 4>shithead.</v>

470
00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:28.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That always seems to me like if that was</v>

471
00:23:28.641 --> 00:23:32.810
<v Speaker 2>really like a plot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if someone had designed like people with</v>

472
00:23:32.811 --> 00:23:34.820
<v Speaker 2>this sort of like puzzle in front of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

473
00:23:34.821 --> 00:23:38.000
<v Speaker 2>the plot is eventually they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get intelligent enough to figure out the</v>

474
00:23:38.001 --> 00:23:43.001
<v Speaker 2>plot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That seems to me to be like a really </v>

475
00:23:43.001 --> 00:23:44.500
<v Speaker 2>shitty way of doing things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's God that's like various.</v>

476
00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:46.670
<v Speaker 2>Tell them how do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very godlike.</v>

477
00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:47.760
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very good.</v>

478
00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:52.810
<v Speaker 4>Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Eventually just tell me that's the only </v>

479
00:23:52.810 --> 00:23:55.661
<v Speaker 4>way to teach kids in that sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Eventually that confusion that people </v>

480
00:23:55.661 --> 00:23:58.040
<v Speaker 4>feel of the existential angst of being a</v>
<v Speaker 4>person.</v>

481
00:23:58.041 --> 00:24:00.110
<v Speaker 4>We don't know what the fuck you are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where are you going?</v>

482
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:04.820
<v Speaker 4>What happens when I die?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like almost universally that needs to be</v>

483
00:24:04.821 --> 00:24:09.821
<v Speaker 4>plugged up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whether it's plugged up with this alien </v>

484
00:24:09.821 --> 00:24:11.430
<v Speaker 4>story or whether it's plugged up with a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

485
00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:13.140
<v Speaker 4>a Mormon story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What happened?</v>

486
00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:14.750
<v Speaker 4>You just got to plug it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

487
00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:22.090
<v Speaker 4>That aching feeling of terror that like </v>
<v Speaker 4>some people that's meant that.</v>

488
00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:24.590
<v Speaker 4>What are we doing here?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are we doing here though?</v>

489
00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:26.310
<v Speaker 4>I understand they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a,</v>

490
00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:27.530
<v Speaker 4>there's a great,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

491
00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:31.780
<v Speaker 4>existentialist philosopher slash author </v>
<v Speaker 4>Khumbu.</v>

492
00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:33.710
<v Speaker 4>You ever heard?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course horse.</v>

493
00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:36.360
<v Speaker 4>I haven't heard of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You haven't?</v>

494
00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:38.750
<v Speaker 4>No strangers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of my favorite books.</v>

495
00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:42.320
<v Speaker 4>I love them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

496
00:24:42.321 --> 00:24:42.830
<v Speaker 4>you'd love him.</v>

497
00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:47.980
<v Speaker 4>But here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just did it yesterday or was it the </v>

498
00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:47.980
<v Speaker 4>day before?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't remember.</v>

499
00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:49.190
<v Speaker 4>That's the first line.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

500
00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:50.000
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

501
00:24:50.001 --> 00:24:55.001
<v Speaker 4>it's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he liked that thing that you're </v>

502
00:24:55.001 --> 00:24:55.001
<v Speaker 4>talking about that at aching fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

503
00:24:55.001 --> 00:24:59.860
<v Speaker 4>His premise c,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a m u s his premise in a lot of,</v>

504
00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:02.570
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of his ilk,</v>

505
00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:03.950
<v Speaker 4>their premise is that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

506
00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:07.880
<v Speaker 4>that is being human,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that awful feeling of like having a</v>

507
00:25:07.881 --> 00:25:11.900
<v Speaker 4>whole that you are constantly trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the name of his book.</v>

508
00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:16.370
<v Speaker 4>The Myth of sisyphus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The stranger illustrated is a novel.</v>

509
00:25:16.570 --> 00:25:21.570
<v Speaker 4>Let's try the myth of sisyphus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you want to get into the philosophy </v>

510
00:25:21.570 --> 00:25:21.820
<v Speaker 4>Anglo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>

511
00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:23.900
<v Speaker 4>it's pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's pretty cool stuff,</v>

512
00:25:23.901 --> 00:25:28.901
<v Speaker 4>but it will give you that chilling kind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sufis s y s is there another wine there?</v>

513
00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:35.170
<v Speaker 4>Assistant s y s y p e h u s fuss as if </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's beautiful.</v>

514
00:25:35.361 --> 00:25:37.100
<v Speaker 4>I don't really need to totally know </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

515
00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:42.440
<v Speaker 4>Google next to be on the kindle crack </v>
<v Speaker 4>crack.</v>

516
00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:48.050
<v Speaker 4>This specificity was cursed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a Greek myth,</v>

517
00:25:48.051 --> 00:25:53.051
<v Speaker 4>was cursed by the gods to eternally push</v>
<v Speaker 4>a boulder up to the very top of a hill </v>

518
00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:55.970
<v Speaker 4>and then to let it roll back down the </v>
<v Speaker 4>hill.</v>

519
00:25:55.971 --> 00:25:58.570
<v Speaker 4>And when it gets to the top of that </v>
<v Speaker 4>story,</v>

520
00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:02.180
<v Speaker 4>is that like the Colonel Turner?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the,</v>

521
00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:07.210
<v Speaker 4>so like the excess,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some existentialists look at the human </v>

522
00:26:07.210 --> 00:26:08.900
<v Speaker 4>predicament and they point out the fact </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you're going to die.</v>

523
00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:11.540
<v Speaker 4>No one will remember you in a few </v>
<v Speaker 4>hundred years.</v>

524
00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:16.720
<v Speaker 4>All,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most human achievements that have </v>

525
00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:16.720
<v Speaker 4>happened in the past are completely </v>
<v Speaker 4>lost,</v>

526
00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:17.480
<v Speaker 4>gone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>forgotten.</v>

527
00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:22.600
<v Speaker 4>Even though they're in history,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's still ultimately a meaningless </v>

528
00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:25.691
<v Speaker 4>thing in a sense that you have this </v>
<v Speaker 4>inevitable personal extinction that's </v>

529
00:26:25.691 --> 00:26:26.020
<v Speaker 4>going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

530
00:26:26.021 --> 00:26:30.650
<v Speaker 4>and so the predicament and life is one </v>
<v Speaker 4>of being sisyphus.</v>

531
00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:32.450
<v Speaker 4>Here we are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anything we do,</v>

532
00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:33.590
<v Speaker 4>push it up the fucking hell.</v>

533
00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:35.660
<v Speaker 4>It's gonna like roll back down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We got to start over,</v>

534
00:26:35.661 --> 00:26:37.310
<v Speaker 4>push it up the hill,</v>
<v Speaker 4>roll back down.</v>

535
00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:41.630
<v Speaker 4>This is the kind of human archetype for </v>
<v Speaker 4>how do we,</v>

536
00:26:41.631 --> 00:26:46.080
<v Speaker 4>in the midst of what appears to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>meaninglessness and the infinite scale,</v>

537
00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:50.250
<v Speaker 4>find meaning in an in like human </v>
<v Speaker 4>endeavors.</v>

538
00:26:50.251 --> 00:26:53.610
<v Speaker 4>When the whole thing's going to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>wiped out by the star,</v>

539
00:26:53.670 --> 00:26:58.670
<v Speaker 4>the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some of those philosophies have brought </v>

540
00:26:58.670 --> 00:26:58.670
<v Speaker 4>them to God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's that?</v>

541
00:26:58.670 --> 00:27:02.390
<v Speaker 4>Some of those existentialist that </v>
<v Speaker 4>brought them to God because there were </v>

542
00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:02.390
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this must be the answer.</v>

543
00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:03.180
<v Speaker 4>The access.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are weirdly,</v>

544
00:27:03.181 --> 00:27:06.390
<v Speaker 4>there are theological or theistic </v>
<v Speaker 4>existentialists,</v>

545
00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:08.820
<v Speaker 4>Soren Kierkegaard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's some of them are,</v>

546
00:27:08.821 --> 00:27:12.620
<v Speaker 4>and you believe in God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're start.</v>

547
00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:14.610
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then they're the ones who are just like,</v>

548
00:27:14.611 --> 00:27:17.430
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just all nausea and confusion.</v>

549
00:27:17.431 --> 00:27:19.390
<v Speaker 4>My friends,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just a lot.</v>

550
00:27:19.410 --> 00:27:22.170
<v Speaker 4>I don't buy that because I don't buy </v>
<v Speaker 4>them knowing.</v>

551
00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:25.380
<v Speaker 4>I don't know anyone that says no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's nothing.</v>

552
00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:27.060
<v Speaker 4>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing like,</v>

553
00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:28.080
<v Speaker 4>how do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing.</v>

554
00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:30.900
<v Speaker 4>You have no idea where.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no examples.</v>

555
00:27:30.901 --> 00:27:32.720
<v Speaker 4>There's no price for something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're right.</v>

556
00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:34.020
<v Speaker 4>Don't even bring it up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

557
00:27:34.021 --> 00:27:36.020
<v Speaker 4>You don't bring it up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you don't say no,</v>

558
00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:39.090
<v Speaker 4>but you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't say it's not something either,</v>

559
00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:41.710
<v Speaker 4>but are you land more in that camp,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't you?</v>

560
00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:44.790
<v Speaker 4>It's not even part of the conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Get out of here with that shit.</v>

561
00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:49.880
<v Speaker 4>What is what a fish were once there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

562
00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:55.790
<v Speaker 4>if you look at the fossil record,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is there any reason to think that </v>

563
00:27:55.790 --> 00:27:56.160
<v Speaker 4>otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are you talking about?</v>

564
00:27:56.220 --> 00:28:01.220
<v Speaker 4>I think there is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's reason to think that </v>

565
00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:02.040
<v Speaker 4>Fisher bears or whatever the fuck you </v>
<v Speaker 4>want to think if it gets you in the zone</v>

566
00:28:03.370 --> 00:28:08.370
<v Speaker 4>because there's like a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's like taking two dribbles worth a </v>

567
00:28:08.370 --> 00:28:08.370
<v Speaker 4>shot.</v>

568
00:28:08.370 --> 00:28:09.190
<v Speaker 4>Like it's just like ritual,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ritual.</v>

569
00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:11.640
<v Speaker 4>It makes you feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's fun thing you just described.</v>

570
00:28:11.641 --> 00:28:15.930
<v Speaker 4>The two dribbles before the foul shot </v>
<v Speaker 4>that the that's called chaos magic.</v>

571
00:28:15.931 --> 00:28:20.931
<v Speaker 4>That's the roots of a magical system </v>
<v Speaker 4>that just that it's based on the idea </v>

572
00:28:20.931 --> 00:28:25.281
<v Speaker 4>that these symbols themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they lack any inherent meaning outside </v>

573
00:28:25.281 --> 00:28:29.511
<v Speaker 4>of the mind state that they place you in</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so if they help you transform your </v>

574
00:28:30.511 --> 00:28:35.160
<v Speaker 4>will into reality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so if that ritual helps you score,</v>

575
00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:39.690
<v Speaker 4>if whatever the fucking thing is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you do prior to sitting down to write or</v>

576
00:28:39.691 --> 00:28:42.390
<v Speaker 4>prior to whatever it is that your job </v>
<v Speaker 4>happens to be,</v>

577
00:28:42.391 --> 00:28:47.391
<v Speaker 4>if that actually puts your mind in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>state where you are more likely to </v>

578
00:28:47.431 --> 00:28:52.431
<v Speaker 4>receive inspiration or you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>be more graceful or athletic and that's </v>

579
00:28:53.731 --> 00:28:55.470
<v Speaker 4>all that fucking matters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who Cares?</v>

580
00:28:56.390 --> 00:28:57.450
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's all that matters.</v>

581
00:28:57.460 --> 00:28:58.950
<v Speaker 4>Who the symbols themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you.</v>

582
00:28:58.950 --> 00:29:03.950
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are you really going to like worry over </v>

583
00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:05.850
<v Speaker 4>the actual existence of a elephant </v>
<v Speaker 4>headed god?</v>

584
00:29:05.851 --> 00:29:10.851
<v Speaker 4>That right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It can shrink down and ride around </v>

585
00:29:10.851 --> 00:29:10.980
<v Speaker 4>family unit over at Rosewell and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

586
00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:16.040
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've fallen out of the issue is a </v>

587
00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:18.141
<v Speaker 4>belief system as much as the issue is </v>
<v Speaker 4>getting caught up in an ideology that </v>

588
00:29:18.141 --> 00:29:20.790
<v Speaker 4>you can't question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's because when you do that,</v>

589
00:29:20.850 --> 00:29:25.850
<v Speaker 4>if you want to go into thor camp or </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever camp you want to go to and you </v>

590
00:29:25.850 --> 00:29:27.690
<v Speaker 4>believe is the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know the grand ruler of the fucking.</v>

591
00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:30.420
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no matter who it is.</v>

592
00:29:30.550 --> 00:29:31.710
<v Speaker 4>In the name of God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Odin,</v>

593
00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:32.540
<v Speaker 4>Odin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>renter,</v>

594
00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:33.410
<v Speaker 4>praise,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Odin.</v>

595
00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:34.680
<v Speaker 4>Praise Odin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

596
00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:39.000
<v Speaker 4>Anytime you can't question anything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're fucks bill.</v>

597
00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:41.250
<v Speaker 4>If you have something you believe</v>

598
00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:47.010
<v Speaker 2>that's probably empowering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not empowering is when you </v>

599
00:29:47.010 --> 00:29:50.371
<v Speaker 2>subscribe to an ideology because if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe that there's some all eternal </v>

600
00:29:50.371 --> 00:29:54.750
<v Speaker 2>loving God that's looking over you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>judging you everyday and that you have </v>

601
00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:57.340
<v Speaker 2>to do your best to make him proud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is your divine father.</v>

602
00:29:57.550 --> 00:30:00.400
<v Speaker 2>He created you and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deepen your DNA.</v>

603
00:30:00.401 --> 00:30:04.780
<v Speaker 2>What the good things you're supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do is if that if you really go live your</v>

604
00:30:04.781 --> 00:30:09.781
<v Speaker 2>life like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll probably live a pretty fucking </v>

605
00:30:09.781 --> 00:30:09.781
<v Speaker 2>cool life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

606
00:30:09.781 --> 00:30:09.790
<v Speaker 2>You'll be really nice to people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd be super righteous.</v>

607
00:30:09.791 --> 00:30:12.490
<v Speaker 2>You would want to make your daddy God </v>
<v Speaker 2>all proud of you and shit.</v>

608
00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:16.300
<v Speaker 2>The problem is when you subscribe to an </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideology,</v>

609
00:30:16.301 --> 00:30:18.760
<v Speaker 2>and that doesn't let you question </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything,</v>

610
00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:23.940
<v Speaker 2>the problem is not believing in a god.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is now what do you have to </v>

611
00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:23.940
<v Speaker 2>do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you believe that God,</v>

612
00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:25.930
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now you have to stop gay marriage.</v>

613
00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:31.080
<v Speaker 2>You have to stop masturbating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to stop people from doing this </v>

614
00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:31.340
<v Speaker 2>and stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

615
00:30:31.390 --> 00:30:36.390
<v Speaker 2>you gotta.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to listen to me because my way </v>

616
00:30:36.390 --> 00:30:36.940
<v Speaker 2>is the right way and the Lord is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>true Islam is the truth.</v>

617
00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:39.220
<v Speaker 2>All of that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all the same shit.</v>

618
00:30:39.370 --> 00:30:41.130
<v Speaker 2>It's all the same shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The ideologies,</v>

619
00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:43.030
<v Speaker 2>the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not the believing in God.</v>

620
00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:45.100
<v Speaker 2>What does this motherfucker God want you</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go?</v>

621
00:30:45.101 --> 00:30:49.390
<v Speaker 2>Do you want me to strap dynamite to your</v>
<v Speaker 2>chest and walk into a cafe,</v>

622
00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:52.270
<v Speaker 4>but God gets associated just like you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about the chicken lady.</v>

623
00:30:52.450 --> 00:30:54.370
<v Speaker 4>God gets associated with that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you want to be like,</v>

624
00:30:54.371 --> 00:30:59.371
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck them and fuck the thing that they </v>

625
00:30:59.371 --> 00:30:59.371
<v Speaker 4>believe in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

626
00:30:59.371 --> 00:30:59.371
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

627
00:30:59.371 --> 00:31:02.881
<v Speaker 4>it's like a guy that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What happens is there's violent people </v>

628
00:31:02.881 --> 00:31:03.220
<v Speaker 4>in the world and they like to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>violent.</v>

629
00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:05.410
<v Speaker 4>They enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It gets them off,</v>

630
00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:10.440
<v Speaker 4>but they can't rationalize the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 4>they enjoy being violent because it's </v>

631
00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:13.540
<v Speaker 4>seems so monstrous and animalistic need.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You need a reason.</v>

632
00:31:13.870 --> 00:31:18.870
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their religion is a fantastic way to </v>

633
00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:20.790
<v Speaker 4>justify every dark activity that humans </v>
<v Speaker 4>engage with.</v>

634
00:31:21.130 --> 00:31:22.660
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can fucking like.</v>

635
00:31:22.661 --> 00:31:24.490
<v Speaker 4>Did you see the thing that popped up on </v>
<v Speaker 4>the Internet?</v>

00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:27.100
<v Speaker 4>Isis is guide to having child sex </v>
<v Speaker 4>slaves.</v>

637

<v Speaker 4>Like I have a guidebook which is like </v>

638
00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:32.400

<v Speaker 4>important questions.</v>

639
00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:36.820
<v Speaker 4>If you have a slave that's under aged,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a girl and you're wanting,</v>

640

<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

642
00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:43.110
<v Speaker 4>I guess they don't like gay people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you have an underage sex slave </v>

643
00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:45.370
<v Speaker 4>that's a girl and you are an isis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to have some questions.</v>

644

<v Speaker 4>The number one being,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when do I get to fuck her?</v>

645
00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:53.940
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this is a guidebook where they're </v>

646
00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:53.940
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

<v Speaker 4>can you fucker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

648
00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:55.860
<v Speaker 4>if she's able to have sex in this </v>
<v Speaker 4>guidebook,</v>

649
00:31:56.150 --> 00:31:58.470
<v Speaker 4>it's as if she's able to have sex.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

650
00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:00.190
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if she's not,</v>

651
00:32:00.191 --> 00:32:03.970
<v Speaker 4>then you can enjoy her in other ways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like just don't penetrate her.</v>

652
00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:05.320
<v Speaker 4>But that's a real thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

653
00:32:05.321 --> 00:32:06.310
<v Speaker 4>They put,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're putting that in there</v>

654
00:32:06.330 --> 00:32:11.330
<v Speaker 2>quoting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do we know this is real and how do </v>

655
00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:11.330
<v Speaker 2>we CIA plant?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We</v>

656
00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:15.710
<v Speaker 4>don't know that it could be an.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did think that this could be </v>

657
00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:15.750
<v Speaker 4>propaganda.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought that this could be propaganda,</v>

658
00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:21.170
<v Speaker 4>but they do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are taking slaves like it is a </v>

659
00:32:21.170 --> 00:32:23.481
<v Speaker 4>thing that they are taking slaves and </v>
<v Speaker 4>some of those slaves are women and if </v>

660
00:32:23.481 --> 00:32:24.420
<v Speaker 4>you have a female slave that you've </v>
<v Speaker 4>taken,</v>

661
00:32:24.421 --> 00:32:29.421
<v Speaker 4>that you've captured from your enemy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you are going to have some </v>

662
00:32:29.421 --> 00:32:30.420
<v Speaker 4>questions about the role.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like as a religious person.</v>

663
00:32:30.690 --> 00:32:31.680
<v Speaker 4>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

664
00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:32.980
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are you going to do with your.</v>

665
00:32:33.270 --> 00:32:38.270
<v Speaker 4>How do you ethically fuck this girl?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when like when the dishwasher was </v>

666
00:32:38.270 --> 00:32:39.200
<v Speaker 4>invented,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jews had to go to the rabbis and said we</v>

667
00:32:39.201 --> 00:32:42.050
<v Speaker 4>allowed to put milk and meat dishes in </v>
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>

668
00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:44.190
<v Speaker 4>What's the ruling here?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That shit,</v>

669
00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:46.190
<v Speaker 4>that kind of logic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They use that based on,</v>

670
00:32:46.370 --> 00:32:46.830
<v Speaker 4>in a second.</v>

671
00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:47.520
<v Speaker 1>Are you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

672
00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:50.700
<v Speaker 1>what is the answer to that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of Jews have separate dishwashers.</v>

673
00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:51.660
<v Speaker 1>Dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Syria,</v>

674
00:32:51.790 --> 00:32:54.840
<v Speaker 1>lariat conflation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my goodness.</v>

675
00:32:54.841 --> 00:32:56.370
<v Speaker 1>If you want to be kosher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

676
00:32:56.460 --> 00:32:58.260
<v Speaker 4>The main thing is the main thing is </v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

677
00:32:58.580 --> 00:32:59.440
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What the.</v>

678
00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:04.480
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's awful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like the sex slavery isn't as </v>

679
00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:04.500
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous as that as the structure is </v>
<v Speaker 4>always the same,</v>

680
00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:07.830
<v Speaker 4>which is a very manipulative,</v>
<v Speaker 4>charismatic power,</v>

681
00:33:07.831 --> 00:33:12.831
<v Speaker 4>hungry narcicisstic guy has convinced </v>
<v Speaker 4>some dumb people that he has got the </v>

682
00:33:12.871 --> 00:33:17.871
<v Speaker 4>line end God and as long as they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>coming to him to ask him what to do,</v>

683
00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:20.700
<v Speaker 4>it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the main structure.</v>

684
00:33:20.701 --> 00:33:25.701
<v Speaker 4>The structure needs to be that have </v>
<v Speaker 4>certain amount of people believe that </v>

685
00:33:25.701 --> 00:33:29.151
<v Speaker 4>there is one person who has contact with</v>
<v Speaker 4>an invisible guy and that that that </v>

686
00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:32.010
<v Speaker 4>person will tell them what's right and </v>
<v Speaker 4>what's wrong.</v>

687
00:33:32.130 --> 00:33:34.620
<v Speaker 4>It's very comforting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't have to worry about it.</v>

688
00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:39.710
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to worry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just go to the guy and ask him like you </v>

689
00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:40.950
<v Speaker 4>can feed her moral quantitative figure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

690
00:33:41.050 --> 00:33:45.440
<v Speaker 4>but it's so dark,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but really when you see what's what,</v>

691
00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:50.470
<v Speaker 4>what's happening,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is this incredibly awful version </v>

692
00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:54.831
<v Speaker 4>of snm it sadomasochism you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>your daddy to find out how the fuck.</v>

693
00:33:55.530 --> 00:33:58.320
<v Speaker 4>It's like this dark say to mass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what it is.</v>

694
00:33:58.321 --> 00:34:03.321
<v Speaker 4>It's snm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to your daddy to find out </v>

695
00:34:03.321 --> 00:34:04.680
<v Speaker 4>if you can put milk with whatever in </v>
<v Speaker 4>your in your washing machine,</v>

696
00:34:04.681 --> 00:34:07.260
<v Speaker 4>you're going to daddy to find out if you</v>
<v Speaker 4>can use birth control.</v>

697
00:34:07.261 --> 00:34:09.720
<v Speaker 4>It's always set.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of times it's sex related.</v>

698
00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:14.960
<v Speaker 4>Like the pope just said something like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't you just come out and say like </v>

699
00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:16.170
<v Speaker 4>you don't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was talking about how to have sex.</v>

700
00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:21.560
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll tell you you can't use birth </v>

701
00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:21.560
<v Speaker 4>control.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know that.</v>

702
00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:24.650
<v Speaker 4>They tell you things involving sex,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a man who is connected to an </v>

703
00:34:24.650 --> 00:34:27.990
<v Speaker 4>invisible being will tell you how to </v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck on this planet.</v>

704
00:34:33.130 --> 00:34:37.230
<v Speaker 4>What I mean it is stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is as dumb as it gets,</v>

705
00:34:37.350 --> 00:34:39.120
<v Speaker 4>but when you consider the fact that it </v>
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>

706
00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:44.300
<v Speaker 4>not only is it real,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it is like these people doing this </v>

707
00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:48.261
<v Speaker 4>are behind businesses that are making </v>
<v Speaker 4>billions of dollars every year and that </v>

708
00:34:48.961 --> 00:34:53.961
<v Speaker 4>money is going in the direction of </v>
<v Speaker 4>paying for lobbyists to control </v>

709
00:34:53.961 --> 00:34:57.291
<v Speaker 4>government and politics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's when it becomes minister </v>

710
00:34:57.291 --> 00:34:57.291
<v Speaker 4>government.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sinister.</v>

711
00:34:57.291 --> 00:34:59.800
<v Speaker 1>If you look at it from a picture </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>

712
00:34:59.890 --> 00:35:04.890
<v Speaker 1>do you think it's possible for people to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have gotten where we've gotten as </v>

713
00:35:04.890 --> 00:35:06.340
<v Speaker 1>quickly as we've gotten without </v>
<v Speaker 1>religion,</v>

714
00:35:06.370 --> 00:35:11.370
<v Speaker 1>without some organizing ethical behavior</v>
<v Speaker 1>was the big jump early on now?</v>

715
00:35:11.811 --> 00:35:13.960
<v Speaker 1>What's holding us back?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're back then it was really helping us</v>

716
00:35:13.961 --> 00:35:15.220
<v Speaker 1>like guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys don't kill.</v>

717
00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:17.710
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would be raping and pillaging.</v>

718
00:35:17.711 --> 00:35:22.711
<v Speaker 1>Still.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a Judeo Christian way of living </v>

719
00:35:22.711 --> 00:35:25.741
<v Speaker 1>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is just like the basic tenants </v>

720
00:35:25.741 --> 00:35:25.741
<v Speaker 1>like don't murder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't steal,</v>

721
00:35:25.741 --> 00:35:25.741
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

722
00:35:25.741 --> 00:35:25.741
<v Speaker 1>don't rape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

723
00:35:25.741 --> 00:35:30.451
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like an idea virus that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>introduced into a system in order to </v>

724
00:35:30.641 --> 00:35:35.641
<v Speaker 1>force growth in a certain direction </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I never would have gotten </v>

725
00:35:35.641 --> 00:35:36.460
<v Speaker 1>society without a doubt it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I doubt it.</v>

726
00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:39.630
<v Speaker 1>Dudes want to fuck the Greeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People want to rape.</v>

727
00:35:40.010 --> 00:35:42.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they had a gang of different gods,</v>

728
00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:44.520
<v Speaker 1>but I think they were kind of like Greek</v>
<v Speaker 1>gods.</v>

729
00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:47.010
<v Speaker 1>I think even back then they were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think even back then.</v>

730
00:35:47.250 --> 00:35:48.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't know for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

731
00:35:48.810 --> 00:35:53.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even going to that part of me </v>
<v Speaker 1>that likes to chime in as though I know </v>

732
00:35:53.810 --> 00:35:56.160
<v Speaker 1>anything about Greek gods to come in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have no idea.</v>

733
00:35:56.580 --> 00:35:57.900
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

734
00:35:59.430 --> 00:36:02.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm not really sure about that man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do think that it's a.</v>

735
00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:06.420
<v Speaker 1>The predicament that regardless of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>being,</v>

736
00:36:06.421 --> 00:36:11.421
<v Speaker 1>whether that was a kind of cast that </v>
<v Speaker 1>needed to be placed on humanity as a </v>

737
00:36:11.431 --> 00:36:15.570
<v Speaker 1>whole to allow this growth or this thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>

738
00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:21.140
<v Speaker 1>Now we're in a place where we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>outgrown the cast time to take off the </v>

739
00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:22.290
<v Speaker 1>cast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's starting to smell like a.</v>

740
00:36:22.370 --> 00:36:26.040
<v Speaker 1>like somebody sneezed into erotic </v>
<v Speaker 1>vagina.</v>

741
00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:28.740
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's being replaced with a new one.</v>

742
00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:33.270
<v Speaker 1>It's being replaced with atheism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Atheism is very much a religion,</v>

743
00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:35.240
<v Speaker 1>but we take those tenants of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

744
00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:36.230
<v Speaker 1>we got killed.</v>

745
00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:38.340
<v Speaker 1>We lost that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean it in a negative way.</v>

746
00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:41.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like religion is the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 1>word.</v>

747
00:36:41.550 --> 00:36:44.790
<v Speaker 1>It's an organized group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people that are a part of it,</v>

748
00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:49.880
<v Speaker 1>they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They subscribed to the ideology of this </v>

749
00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:53.181
<v Speaker 1>organized group and or almost like for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>large percentage at least,</v>

750
00:36:53.551 --> 00:36:57.420
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't say almost the majority,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a large percentage or liberal,</v>

751
00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.520
<v Speaker 1>a large percentage of atheists are </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberal people.</v>

752
00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:08.300
<v Speaker 1>They tend to lean left with their ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say if you had to gauge the </v>

753
00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:10.080
<v Speaker 1>difference between the Republican side </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there were Democrats are like,</v>

754
00:37:10.081 --> 00:37:13.530
<v Speaker 1>which one has more atheist?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would clearly be Democrat.</v>

755
00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:14.640
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that right?</v>

756
00:37:14.641 --> 00:37:16.170
<v Speaker 1>Am I guessing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just guessing.</v>

757
00:37:16.210 --> 00:37:18.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see if we're right.</v>

758
00:37:18.451 --> 00:37:19.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that's been done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

759
00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:22.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems pretty logical to think that.</v>

760
00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:24.840
<v Speaker 1>You mean it does seem logical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's see if it's true.</v>

761
00:37:25.590 --> 00:37:30.590
<v Speaker 1>Also the more into their super into God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Republicans might have some </v>

762
00:37:30.590 --> 00:37:31.540
<v Speaker 1>atheists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the ones that are super undergone,</v>

763
00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:34.440
<v Speaker 1>those are more Republicans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really know.</v>

764
00:37:34.770 --> 00:37:37.500
<v Speaker 1>Could you be a single president?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that even country?</v>

765
00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:39.540
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The candidates of the president.</v>

766
00:37:39.541 --> 00:37:40.140
<v Speaker 1>You can't be like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

767
00:37:40.141 --> 00:37:42.530
<v Speaker 1>if you haven't figured that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hardly think.</v>

768
00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:47.540
<v Speaker 1>I was wondering what would happen like </v>
<v Speaker 1>if Obama as a president allowed to have </v>

769
00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:50.040
<v Speaker 1>another job like in Obama start like </v>
<v Speaker 1>working on comedy.</v>

770
00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:53.700
<v Speaker 1>Could he do stand up if he wanted to at </v>
<v Speaker 1>night?</v>

771
00:37:53.701 --> 00:37:57.660
<v Speaker 1>If he wasn't working at better could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be amazing.</v>

772
00:37:57.690 --> 00:37:59.730
<v Speaker 1>I've done my job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's 6:30</v>

773
00:37:59.730 --> 00:38:01.050
<v Speaker 1>PM.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I worked an extra hour.</v>

774
00:38:01.051 --> 00:38:06.051
<v Speaker 1>I'm clocked out president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the people in Congress are </v>

775
00:38:06.121 --> 00:38:09.810
<v Speaker 1>closeted that are atheist closet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

776
00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:14.840
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a bunch of fucking fakers it's </v>

777
00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:15.720
<v Speaker 1>saying there's an article about this on </v>
<v Speaker 1>a progress.</v>

778
00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:20.100
<v Speaker 1>Why all of the atheists in Congress are </v>
<v Speaker 1>are closeted.</v>

779
00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:25.790
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll say it had to pretend like you </v>

780
00:38:25.790 --> 00:38:25.790
<v Speaker 1>can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not popular.</v>

781
00:38:25.790 --> 00:38:29.240
<v Speaker 1>Atheism is not unpopular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a certain thing that people want</v>

782
00:38:29.241 --> 00:38:30.990
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to say something really stupid</v>

783
00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:34.590
<v Speaker 1>and have everybody else go you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not going to think anymore than we</v>

784
00:38:34.591 --> 00:38:36.340
<v Speaker 1>already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

785
00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:37.600
<v Speaker 3>When people say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

786
00:38:37.601 --> 00:38:42.601
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I meet somebody and they're an atheist </v>

787
00:38:42.601 --> 00:38:45.550
<v Speaker 3>walk way because they're a damn fool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who said a Steve Harvey.</v>

788
00:38:45.610 --> 00:38:50.610
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did it in a white boy damn food and it</v>

789
00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:58.890
<v Speaker 3>gets silly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Silly,</v>

790
00:38:59.050 --> 00:38:59.500
<v Speaker 3>silly,</v>

791
00:39:02.130 --> 00:39:04.760
<v Speaker 4>that's an argument,</v>
<v Speaker 4>PJ Harvey or whatever it was,</v>

792
00:39:05.330 --> 00:39:07.950
<v Speaker 4>kind of moral compass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you operate on them?</v>

793
00:39:08.010 --> 00:39:13.010
<v Speaker 4>That's the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't trust you if you don't believe </v>

794
00:39:13.010 --> 00:39:15.681
<v Speaker 4>and assemble.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was created a long time ago by </v>

795
00:39:15.681 --> 00:39:18.360
<v Speaker 4>people trying to control other people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is like silly,</v>

796
00:39:18.361 --> 00:39:21.420
<v Speaker 4>so forget it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a book I read in God dammit.</v>

797
00:39:21.421 --> 00:39:26.421
<v Speaker 4>I wish I could remember the name of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the very first chapter in the book </v>

798
00:39:26.421 --> 00:39:29.391
<v Speaker 4>was talking about how fascinating it is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that in the old testament when God is </v>

799
00:39:31.201 --> 00:39:33.240
<v Speaker 4>asking for offerings,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

800
00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:38.950
<v Speaker 4>killed only want stuff that humans like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he only wants the best thing.</v>

801
00:39:38.971 --> 00:39:43.971
<v Speaker 4>Like God never tells priests to ask </v>
<v Speaker 4>people for like a jar of wasps.</v>

802
00:39:45.290 --> 00:39:48.510
<v Speaker 4>It's only,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's only like goats.</v>

803
00:39:48.930 --> 00:39:53.930
<v Speaker 4>Like now the same system worked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then the priest would come out and be </v>

804
00:39:53.930 --> 00:39:54.360
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>God wants.</v>

805
00:39:54.361 --> 00:39:55.620
<v Speaker 4>They do money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what they do.</v>

806
00:39:55.620 --> 00:39:58.280
<v Speaker 4>The fucking people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jimmy or whatever his name is.</v>

807
00:39:58.580 --> 00:39:59.150
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

808
00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:04.160
<v Speaker 4>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The difference is money now it's this </v>

809
00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:05.901
<v Speaker 4>ambiguous thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but back then what was kind of </v>

810
00:40:05.901 --> 00:40:07.581
<v Speaker 4>interesting is like you would actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>ask for like the fatted calf or you'd </v>

811
00:40:07.681 --> 00:40:12.681
<v Speaker 4>ask her stuff was only stuff pad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>God wants a new ipad.</v>

812
00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:15.210
<v Speaker 4>Technology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

813
00:40:15.211 --> 00:40:17.700
<v Speaker 4>God wants a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't let your computers.</v>

814
00:40:17.730 --> 00:40:18.510
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very.</v>

815
00:40:18.570 --> 00:40:20.970
<v Speaker 4>It's fascinating that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I still.</v>

816
00:40:20.971 --> 00:40:22.620
<v Speaker 4>I mean I do like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

817
00:40:22.650 --> 00:40:24.540
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think God's an overused word,</v>

818
00:40:24.541 --> 00:40:27.000
<v Speaker 4>but I do think there is definitely like </v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what God wants.</v>

819
00:40:27.001 --> 00:40:28.620
<v Speaker 4>He didn't really tell us officially.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How about,</v>

820
00:40:28.830 --> 00:40:30.000
<v Speaker 4>how about we just give him some of this </v>
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>

821
00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:31.440
<v Speaker 4>It's our favorite shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

822
00:40:31.441 --> 00:40:33.420
<v Speaker 4>Just get on the ice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

823
00:40:33.421 --> 00:40:38.421
<v Speaker 4>That's really fascinating stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been reading this book that I know </v>

824
00:40:38.421 --> 00:40:39.300
<v Speaker 4>it's a controversial book and some </v>
<v Speaker 4>people say that it's like,</v>

825
00:40:39.690 --> 00:40:40.080
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

826
00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:41.490
<v Speaker 4>I liked the book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's well written.</v>

827
00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:46.760
<v Speaker 4>It's called a zealot by Reza as la land.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the historical Christ and his </v>

828
00:40:48.091 --> 00:40:53.091
<v Speaker 4>premise is that Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the regardless of its premise,</v>

829
00:40:53.461 --> 00:40:58.461
<v Speaker 4>what's really fascinating is he just </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about what it was like back </v>

830
00:40:58.461 --> 00:40:59.000
<v Speaker 4>then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is that the Romans had,</v>

831
00:40:59.010 --> 00:41:01.290
<v Speaker 4>were occupying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

832
00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:02.520
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

833
00:41:02.521 --> 00:41:07.521
<v Speaker 4>that land and that the priests were </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually people who were used to be used</v>

834
00:41:08.161 --> 00:41:13.161
<v Speaker 4>to be like a religious thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they were by their positions from </v>

835
00:41:13.161 --> 00:41:14.130
<v Speaker 4>the Romans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So everybody wanted the Romans gone.</v>

836
00:41:14.310 --> 00:41:15.270
<v Speaker 4>And so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

837
00:41:15.271 --> 00:41:16.280
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like,</v>

838
00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:18.480
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the story in the Bible,</v>

839
00:41:18.481 --> 00:41:23.481
<v Speaker 4>Jesus is crucified between two thieves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so Reza Aslan says that if you look </v>

840
00:41:23.481 --> 00:41:28.221
<v Speaker 4>at the actual word for thief,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it actually translates into bandit and </v>

841
00:41:28.681 --> 00:41:33.681
<v Speaker 4>bandit is the word that the Romans used </v>
<v Speaker 4>to describe people who are trying to </v>

842
00:41:33.681 --> 00:41:35.030
<v Speaker 4>overthrow them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So Jesus,</v>

843
00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:40.280
<v Speaker 4>his premises was somebody who was pro </v>
<v Speaker 4>violence and wanted to overthrow the </v>

844
00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:40.850
<v Speaker 4>Romans.</v>

845
00:41:40.850 --> 00:41:43.010
<v Speaker 4>And there were a lot of other people I </v>
<v Speaker 4>came to.</v>

846
00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:48.200
<v Speaker 4>And so when people were saying they were</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the son of God or the Messiah,</v>

847
00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:52.910
<v Speaker 4>the Term Messiah actually meant like the</v>
<v Speaker 4>King of the Jews.</v>

848
00:41:52.911 --> 00:41:56.120
<v Speaker 4>Somebody who is going to like lead the </v>
<v Speaker 4>liberate the Jews from the Romans.</v>

849
00:41:56.330 --> 00:41:59.060
<v Speaker 4>It's a really great book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In the very first chapter,</v>

850
00:41:59.061 --> 00:42:00.860
<v Speaker 4>title,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it'd be a cool fucking movie.</v>

851
00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:06.040
<v Speaker 4>It would be really cool,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the version of when they talk about </v>

852
00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:06.850
<v Speaker 4>the the same,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well they weren't.</v>

853
00:42:06.970 --> 00:42:11.970
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean a lot of like what he says is </v>

854
00:42:11.970 --> 00:42:11.970
<v Speaker 4>like if you read in the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

855
00:42:11.970 --> 00:42:15.190
<v Speaker 4>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the Bible now they haven't scrubbed </v>

856
00:42:15.190 --> 00:42:17.741
<v Speaker 4>all of the violence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Debbie said one thing he said is like </v>

857
00:42:17.741 --> 00:42:18.190
<v Speaker 4>something about I will turn you away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I will turn,</v>

858
00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:21.980
<v Speaker 4>turn father against son.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I will turn like,</v>

859
00:42:21.981 --> 00:42:26.780
<v Speaker 4>if you aren't able to leave your family </v>
<v Speaker 4>then you'll never be able to follow me.</v>

860
00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:31.780
<v Speaker 4>It's like all these things which are </v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy to liberty is fucking Romans Outta</v>

861
00:42:32.211 --> 00:42:32.800
<v Speaker 4>here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

862
00:42:32.810 --> 00:42:37.810
<v Speaker 4>That was the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These assholes are occupying our </v>

863
00:42:37.810 --> 00:42:37.810
<v Speaker 4>country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've taken over our religion.</v>

864
00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:42.940
<v Speaker 4>We're going to fucking overthrow them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they really couldn't understand why </v>

865
00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:44.690
<v Speaker 4>God let the Romans in there in the first</v>
<v Speaker 4>place.</v>

866
00:42:44.691 --> 00:42:49.100
<v Speaker 4>So that was a real monkey wrench in </v>
<v Speaker 4>their ideas were the chosen people.</v>

867
00:42:49.101 --> 00:42:49.760
<v Speaker 4>But it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

868
00:42:49.761 --> 00:42:54.761
<v Speaker 4>you're not really that fucking chosen </v>
<v Speaker 4>people because they're guys who are </v>

869
00:42:54.761 --> 00:42:57.240
<v Speaker 4>guarding your temples now wearing Roman </v>
<v Speaker 4>outfits.</v>

870
00:42:57.241 --> 00:43:02.241
<v Speaker 4>And mine's got freedom from slavery that</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're sorta half slaves again quickly </v>

871
00:43:02.241 --> 00:43:03.140
<v Speaker 4>and they couldn't tie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Didn't work,</v>

872
00:43:03.141 --> 00:43:08.141
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like the to the paradigm did not </v>

873
00:43:08.141 --> 00:43:08.420
<v Speaker 4>fit in with their idea that we're the </v>
<v Speaker 4>chosen people.</v>

874
00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:11.240
<v Speaker 4>Suddenly there's these fucking Romans </v>
<v Speaker 4>occupying everything.</v>

875
00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:16.420
<v Speaker 4>And so a lot of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these messiahs and there are many </v>

876
00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:16.700
<v Speaker 4>besides before Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>

877
00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:20.120
<v Speaker 4>John the Baptist executed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why was he executed?</v>

878
00:43:20.121 --> 00:43:25.121
<v Speaker 4>He was executed because they looked at </v>
<v Speaker 4>him as a threat to the Roman power </v>

879
00:43:25.121 --> 00:43:25.121
<v Speaker 4>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was it.</v>

880
00:43:25.121 --> 00:43:27.200
<v Speaker 4>All these people getting crucified.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And by the way,</v>

881
00:43:27.201 --> 00:43:29.120
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>crucifixion was in back then,</v>

882
00:43:29.121 --> 00:43:32.180
<v Speaker 4>like they were throwing people on </v>
<v Speaker 4>crosses every day.</v>

883
00:43:32.181 --> 00:43:37.181
<v Speaker 4>So it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was like a constant attempt to like </v>

884
00:43:37.181 --> 00:43:38.080
<v Speaker 4>take down a rebellion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>

885
00:43:38.090 --> 00:43:39.620
<v Speaker 4>Silence the rebellion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

886
00:43:39.980 --> 00:43:41.360
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I silenced the rebellion.</v>

887
00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:42.550
<v Speaker 4>It's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Great Book.</v>

888
00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:47.630
<v Speaker 2>It's really crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But those sort of volatile moments in </v>

889
00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:51.021
<v Speaker 2>history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazed insane violent moments of control</v>

890
00:43:51.181 --> 00:43:54.060
<v Speaker 2>and then the repercussions of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>control,</v>

891
00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:59.280
<v Speaker 2>those are like the engines that fuel </v>
<v Speaker 2>change and oftentimes fuel innovation </v>

892
00:43:59.610 --> 00:44:01.160
<v Speaker 2>and I know we'll look at them as being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

893
00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:06.200
<v Speaker 2>we look at them as being as like </v>
<v Speaker 2>horrible moments when they're happening </v>

894
00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:07.680
<v Speaker 2>because they are for everyone involved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like for the future,</v>

895
00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:12.910
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think all these chaotic moments where </v>

896
00:44:12.910 --> 00:44:15.651
<v Speaker 2>these people struggling to get into a </v>
<v Speaker 2>position for power in the fact that </v>

897
00:44:15.651 --> 00:44:16.350
<v Speaker 2>nobody could really hold it and it keeps</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people have their complaints and the</v>

898
00:44:16.351 --> 00:44:18.480
<v Speaker 2>people that are rising up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have the will of the people because</v>

899
00:44:18.481 --> 00:44:20.690
<v Speaker 2>the will of the people is we don't want </v>
<v Speaker 2>any as fucking terror anymore.</v>

900
00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:21.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

901
00:44:21.370 --> 00:44:21.810
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

902
00:44:21.811 --> 00:44:23.790
<v Speaker 2>let's go get them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they get in and they become the</v>

903
00:44:23.791 --> 00:44:25.050
<v Speaker 2>person that we're fighting against.</v>

904
00:44:25.050 --> 00:44:28.680
<v Speaker 2>Like this process repeats itself over </v>
<v Speaker 2>and over again.</v>

905
00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:30.840
<v Speaker 2>And it seems like objectively,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at it,</v>

906
00:44:30.841 --> 00:44:33.780
<v Speaker 2>it's this process of cleansing or </v>
<v Speaker 2>filtering,</v>

907
00:44:33.781 --> 00:44:38.781
<v Speaker 2>almost like water coming down from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>glacier and going through all those </v>

908
00:44:38.781 --> 00:44:39.660
<v Speaker 2>rocks until it becomes pure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

909
00:44:39.661 --> 00:44:42.000
<v Speaker 2>it's got to go through all these trials </v>
<v Speaker 2>and tribulations.</v>

910
00:44:42.001 --> 00:44:45.120
<v Speaker 2>There's got to be all these fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>chaotic moments of horror.</v>

911
00:44:45.121 --> 00:44:47.730
<v Speaker 2>So we understand what har is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We never repeat her.</v>

912
00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:50.910
<v Speaker 2>You got to have a holocaust,</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand where the sixties came from.</v>

913
00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:56.120
<v Speaker 2>You've got to have these bad moments </v>
<v Speaker 2>that sort of make you like long for and </v>

914
00:44:56.920 --> 00:44:58.350
<v Speaker 2>accomplish the great height.</v>

915
00:44:58.740 --> 00:45:03.740
<v Speaker 4>This is why I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just had Alex Gray on my podcast and </v>

916
00:45:03.740 --> 00:45:05.740
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to try to repeat what he </v>
<v Speaker 4>said about the Jews,</v>

917
00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:08.220
<v Speaker 4>the chosen people because they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>creating psychedelics,</v>

918
00:45:08.221 --> 00:45:11.970
<v Speaker 4>but he did one of his premises because </v>
<v Speaker 4>Hoffman was a Jew.</v>

919
00:45:12.150 --> 00:45:17.150
<v Speaker 4>But when will,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the idea is that we needed scientific </v>

920
00:45:17.150 --> 00:45:18.450
<v Speaker 4>materialism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>atheism.</v>

921
00:45:18.451 --> 00:45:23.451
<v Speaker 4>We needed people to turn their backs on </v>
<v Speaker 4>the ancient version of God so that we </v>

922
00:45:23.791 --> 00:45:28.791
<v Speaker 4>can understand the universe at a deep </v>
<v Speaker 4>enough level to be able to,</v>

923
00:45:29.790 --> 00:45:32.240
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>create the,</v>

924
00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:36.990
<v Speaker 4>to synthesize lsd and all the various </v>
<v Speaker 4>smart to figure that shit out.</v>

925
00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:37.990
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's really cool.</v>

926
00:45:37.991 --> 00:45:42.991
<v Speaker 4>But it's kind of what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is like we needed like these </v>

927
00:45:42.991 --> 00:45:44.950
<v Speaker 4>phases in human evolution are really </v>
<v Speaker 4>important because like if,</v>

928
00:45:44.990 --> 00:45:46.170
<v Speaker 4>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're constant,</v>

929
00:45:46.171 --> 00:45:51.171
<v Speaker 4>if you're caught up and are ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 4>version of the deity and then maybe </v>

930
00:45:51.171 --> 00:45:55.701
<v Speaker 4>you're not going to be so inclined to </v>
<v Speaker 4>study molecular biology or maybe you're </v>

931
00:45:55.701 --> 00:45:59.271
<v Speaker 4>not gonna be able to study chemistry in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the same way and without studying that </v>

932
00:45:59.271 --> 00:46:02.901
<v Speaker 4>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then we wouldn't have some of the </v>

933
00:46:02.901 --> 00:46:06.021
<v Speaker 4>psychoactive compounds that I think a </v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of people consider as being one of </v>

934
00:46:07.141 --> 00:46:11.910
<v Speaker 4>the potential ways that our species can </v>
<v Speaker 4>evolve.</v>

935
00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:13.800
<v Speaker 4>And so these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>

936
00:46:14.070 --> 00:46:19.070
<v Speaker 4>these psychedelics can actually be ways </v>
<v Speaker 4>to connect with the thing that the </v>

937
00:46:19.070 --> 00:46:23.721
<v Speaker 4>ancient religions were talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then the thing that ended up being </v>

938
00:46:23.721 --> 00:46:26.490
<v Speaker 4>like turning turned into like a painted </v>
<v Speaker 4>clown,</v>

939
00:46:26.730 --> 00:46:28.060
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that people will.</v>

940
00:46:28.170 --> 00:46:30.030
<v Speaker 4>Somebody had a vision,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

941
00:46:30.031 --> 00:46:32.650
<v Speaker 4>Moses by that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was the burning Bush Bush,</v>

942
00:46:32.730 --> 00:46:34.320
<v Speaker 4>what was that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was it made of though?</v>

943
00:46:34.330 --> 00:46:38.280
<v Speaker 4>It was called a Acacia or something </v>
<v Speaker 4>which has what in it?</v>

944
00:46:38.310 --> 00:46:39.780
<v Speaker 4>DMT.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tryptamine.</v>

945
00:46:39.781 --> 00:46:42.240
<v Speaker 4>So the premise here is godliness</v>

946
00:46:42.670 --> 00:46:43.510
<v Speaker 2>fucking hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

947
00:46:43.511 --> 00:46:47.480
<v Speaker 2>the idea of what is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would the story really big?</v>

948
00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:52.500
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're translating something from </v>

949
00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:52.500
<v Speaker 2>ancient Hebrew and then you put into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Latin and then eventually the English,</v>

950
00:46:52.830 --> 00:46:54.810
<v Speaker 2>what when you're doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to.</v>

951
00:46:55.030 --> 00:46:58.180
<v Speaker 2>The way they explain things is going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>come off very different.</v>

952
00:46:58.181 --> 00:47:01.540
<v Speaker 2>Like if you ever read like Russian </v>
<v Speaker 2>story's translated to English.</v>

953
00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:03.240
<v Speaker 2>There's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so bizarre.</v>

954
00:47:03.241 --> 00:47:05.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Throw it through Google translate.</v>

955
00:47:05.890 --> 00:47:08.080
<v Speaker 2>It's so busy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so hard to understand what is their</v>

956
00:47:08.081 --> 00:47:13.081
<v Speaker 2>language works so much differently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So by saying that like God took the form</v>

957
00:47:13.091 --> 00:47:18.091
<v Speaker 2>of a burning Bush,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they easily could be saying he was </v>

958
00:47:18.091 --> 00:47:18.091
<v Speaker 2>smoking dmt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

959
00:47:18.091 --> 00:47:18.610
<v Speaker 2>Easily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

960
00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:23.720
<v Speaker 2>and that's the fucking answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You dry the fucking that Bush out.</v>

961
00:47:24.090 --> 00:47:26.230
<v Speaker 2>Figure out a way to get the fucking dmt </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of it.</v>

962
00:47:26.231 --> 00:47:27.730
<v Speaker 2>You smoke it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you.</v>

963
00:47:27.731 --> 00:47:30.070
<v Speaker 2>And especially if that's how they did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what if they just lit</v>

964
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:32.690
<v Speaker 1>those bushes on fire and then just read </v>
<v Speaker 1>it all in,</v>

965
00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:35.470
<v Speaker 1>some out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just breathe in wholesale smoke.</v>

966
00:47:35.890 --> 00:47:39.190
<v Speaker 1>They did it like totally caveman style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just take those bushes,</v>

967
00:47:39.191 --> 00:47:40.540
<v Speaker 1>hack them down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dry them out,</v>

968
00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:45.720
<v Speaker 1>make a fucking a tent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like one of those sweat lodges and let </v>

969
00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:49.870
<v Speaker 1>it fill up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hot herself with dmt and then he saw God</v>

970
00:47:49.871 --> 00:47:50.500
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

971
00:47:51.070 --> 00:47:52.040
<v Speaker 1>everybody down there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.</v>

972
00:47:52.650 --> 00:47:53.680
<v Speaker 1>I got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

973
00:47:53.681 --> 00:47:55.730
<v Speaker 1>I got some stuff to tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

974
00:47:57.010 --> 00:48:01.060
<v Speaker 1>Because God was telling you that not to </v>
<v Speaker 1>covet your neighbor's wife,</v>

975
00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:06.120
<v Speaker 1>not because your neighbor's wife is like</v>
<v Speaker 1>his leaves my life while was alone.</v>

976
00:48:07.260 --> 00:48:09.510
<v Speaker 1>The idea was that the guy owns that </v>
<v Speaker 1>white.</v>

977
00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:10.180
<v Speaker 1>Hey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

978
00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:14.530
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this insane archaic way of thinking</v>

979
00:48:14.531 --> 00:48:16.480
<v Speaker 1>that's connected to that time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

980
00:48:16.540 --> 00:48:20.380
<v Speaker 1>So we don't even if Moses did say those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

981
00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:22.810
<v Speaker 1>we have no idea what the actual words </v>
<v Speaker 1>that came out.</v>

982
00:48:22.930 --> 00:48:25.250
<v Speaker 1>If Moses did have this psychedelic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ancient,</v>

983
00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:28.300
<v Speaker 1>he was not used anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And not only that,</v>

984
00:48:28.330 --> 00:48:31.660
<v Speaker 1>like who the fuck wrote it down?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't Moses.</v>

985
00:48:31.780 --> 00:48:34.630
<v Speaker 1>Moses didn't write it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I told you some shit that happened to</v>

986
00:48:34.631 --> 00:48:39.631
<v Speaker 1>me when I was a child and then you were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was your job to write a book after I </v>

987
00:48:39.631 --> 00:48:39.631
<v Speaker 1>died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

988
00:48:39.631 --> 00:48:41.200
<v Speaker 1>you would butcher it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would put your,</v>

989
00:48:41.210 --> 00:48:42.590
<v Speaker 1>your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would butcher Milo.</v>

990
00:48:42.610 --> 00:48:47.610
<v Speaker 1>We would butcher each other's lives if </v>
<v Speaker 1>Moses wasn't writing it himself to </v>

991
00:48:47.610 --> 00:48:47.610
<v Speaker 1>Moses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

992
00:48:47.610 --> 00:48:52.140
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're not getting his fucking </v>

993
00:48:52.140 --> 00:48:53.791
<v Speaker 1>notebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like who knows what was actually said </v>

994
00:48:53.791 --> 00:48:55.840
<v Speaker 1>but jealous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Written the same way throughout history.</v>

995
00:48:55.841 --> 00:48:57.880
<v Speaker 1>Like they write every letter the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>exact way.</v>

996
00:48:57.910 --> 00:49:01.330
<v Speaker 1>That's the written tour world tour or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something crazy looking,</v>

997
00:49:01.331 --> 00:49:06.331
<v Speaker 1>by the way is a language that's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's beautiful and it's so strange and </v>

998
00:49:06.331 --> 00:49:06.800
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic.</v>

999
00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:10.450
<v Speaker 1>They have to have a musical notes on </v>
<v Speaker 1>each one of the letters.</v>

1000
00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:15.540
<v Speaker 1>You can really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what to go up and say it while </v>

1001
00:49:18.060 --> 00:49:21.340
<v Speaker 1>you're reading at the Toro road or </v>
<v Speaker 1>partial.</v>

1002
00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:23.830
<v Speaker 1>Can you read Hebrew?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

1003
00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:24.940
<v Speaker 1>Fucking crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1004
00:49:24.941 --> 00:49:28.480
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to learn it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You lived in Israel,</v>

1005
00:49:29.830 --> 00:49:31.870
<v Speaker 1>religious studies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it fun?</v>

1006
00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:32.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can.</v>

1007
00:49:32.411 --> 00:49:34.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just like a given for awhile,</v>

1008
00:49:34.470 --> 00:49:36.040
<v Speaker 1>but now that I look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>step back and look at it,</v>

1009
00:49:36.041 --> 00:49:37.390
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty fucking cool.</v>

1010
00:49:38.770 --> 00:49:39.880
<v Speaker 1>Three weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was cool.</v>

1011
00:49:39.881 --> 00:49:43.000
<v Speaker 1>I lived in Israel for two years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1012
00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:44.590
<v Speaker 1>How old were you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>18.</v>

1013
00:49:44.620 --> 00:49:49.620
<v Speaker 1>18 to 20.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was all that got drunk there for </v>

1014
00:49:49.620 --> 00:49:49.620
<v Speaker 1>the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pre,</v>

1015
00:49:49.620 --> 00:49:50.010
<v Speaker 1>post,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pre pussy.</v>

1016
00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:52.390
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't do anything back there.</v>

1017
00:49:52.420 --> 00:49:54.360
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a fast.</v>

1018
00:49:54.380 --> 00:49:57.400
<v Speaker 1>So slowly take the buses and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's it like there?</v>

1019
00:49:57.460 --> 00:49:58.990
<v Speaker 1>Everything's made of stone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jerusalem.</v>

1020
00:49:59.290 --> 00:50:01.930
<v Speaker 1>The whole city made up stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The old all stone.</v>

1021
00:50:02.170 --> 00:50:04.390
<v Speaker 1>But everywhere else is like stone </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside,</v>

1022
00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:07.000
<v Speaker 1>you know the buildings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just looked really pretty.</v>

1023
00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:11.110
<v Speaker 1>Did you go to that wall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>climbed up in that movie,</v>

1024
00:50:12.850 --> 00:50:15.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>security cameras.</v>

1025
00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:21.150
<v Speaker 1>Why Monitor to the wall?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Separating from a mass of zombies </v>

1026
00:50:22.450 --> 00:50:25.930
<v Speaker 1>dancing and having a great time and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden it's not fine.</v>

1027
00:50:27.050 --> 00:50:32.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He escaped to easily a lot in that </v>

1028
00:50:32.050 --> 00:50:34.511
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like plane crash and then only the two </v>

1029
00:50:34.511 --> 00:50:34.511
<v Speaker 1>of you survive.</v>

1030
00:50:36.250 --> 00:50:39.260
<v Speaker 1>It's like Godzilla.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same sort of situation.</v>

1031
00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:42.260
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you were there from 18 to 20?</v>

1032
00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:44.700
<v Speaker 1>Eighteen to 20.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really got drunk for the first time.</v>

1033
00:50:44.701 --> 00:50:45.770
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what years was that?</v>

1034

<v Speaker 1>Scariest word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every.</v>

1052
00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:46.160
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to do like a full three 60 </v>

<v Speaker 1>You want people to know this.</v>

1060
00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:15.920
<v Speaker 1>The only racial slur that that is a free</v>
<v Speaker 1>pass to violence.</v>

1061
00:52:16.150 --> 00:52:18.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>but there are certain dudes that if they</v>

00:52:37.290 --> 00:52:38.090
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

1068
00:52:38.091 --> 00:52:40.940
<v Speaker 1>If you're in a place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's guaranteed.</v>

1069
00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:42.400
<v Speaker 1>There's people that just heard you say </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1070
00:52:42.420 --> 00:52:43.800
<v Speaker 1>that are going to be offended.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

1071
00:52:43.850 --> 00:52:44.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck that guy.</v>

1072
00:52:44.911 --> 00:52:47.360
<v Speaker 1>You know who?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck he think he is yelling at shit out.</v>

1073
00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:50.910
<v Speaker 1>Dropping bombs podcast 22 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1074
00:52:50.930 --> 00:52:55.930
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't even matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just the fact that you had just said it </v>

1075
00:52:55.930 --> 00:52:55.930
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1076
00:52:55.930 --> 00:52:56.840
<v Speaker 1>Just the fact that making fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that how irresponsible.</v>

1077
00:52:56.841 --> 00:53:01.841
<v Speaker 1>What's to say that you remember like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit about the three magic words and that</v>

1078
00:53:02.031 --> 00:53:04.940
<v Speaker 1>was one of them that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't even say it,</v>

1079
00:53:05.060 --> 00:53:08.150
<v Speaker 1>like you're not even allowed to say the </v>
<v Speaker 1>word reference to if your weight.</v>

1080
00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:08.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1081
00:53:09.190 --> 00:53:12.490
<v Speaker 4>It is a really interesting thing because</v>
<v Speaker 4>symbols are harmless,</v>

1082
00:53:12.940 --> 00:53:17.940
<v Speaker 4>but it somehow they justified violence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like whenever this ridiculous thing and </v>

1083
00:53:18.850 --> 00:53:21.800
<v Speaker 4>image of the prophet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the word round,</v>

1084
00:53:21.910 --> 00:53:26.910
<v Speaker 4>whenever it's there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like that thing itself is </v>

1085
00:53:26.910 --> 00:53:26.910
<v Speaker 4>meaningless.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Harmless.</v>

1086
00:53:26.910 --> 00:53:31.430
<v Speaker 3>But it allows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it allows violent people an excuse to be</v>

1087
00:53:32.551 --> 00:53:37.551
<v Speaker 3>violent and there is nothing I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>more satisfying than some people,</v>

1088
00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:39.230
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1089
00:53:39.250 --> 00:53:44.250
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be violent and righteous at the same </v>

1090
00:53:44.250 --> 00:53:47.391
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like American sniper that guys like </v>

1091
00:53:47.391 --> 00:53:48.900
<v Speaker 3>pegging like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1092
00:53:48.901 --> 00:53:52.740
<v Speaker 3>it's just some propaganda over from </v>
<v Speaker 3>kills.</v>

1093
00:53:52.741 --> 00:53:54.540
<v Speaker 3>Not One role.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even though every time it was like,</v>

1094
00:53:54.810 --> 00:53:55.980
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is because man,</v>

1102
00:54:15.601 --> 00:54:17.580
<v Speaker 3>There was no plot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was just some scenes.</v>

1103
00:54:17.581 --> 00:54:20.610

<v Speaker 3>that your son or your daughter and they </v>

1126
00:55:08.780 --> 00:55:08.780

<v Speaker 3>procession.</v>

00:55:08.780 --> 00:55:13.220
<v Speaker 3>Also.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guys like Jesse Ventura sued that </v>

1128
00:55:13.220 --> 00:55:13.920
<v Speaker 3>guy and one the guy who lied.</v>

00:55:22.460 --> 00:55:25.230
<v Speaker 3>That was that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No wonder Carbon Jasper.</v>

1133
00:55:25.231 --> 00:55:27.350

<v Speaker 3>like A.</v>

1134
00:55:28.280 --> 00:55:33.280
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 2>himself.</v>

1138
00:55:38.030 --> 00:55:42.710
<v Speaker 2>Apparently that's how I saw no evidence </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the car jacking.</v>

1139
00:55:42.711 --> 00:55:47.711
<v Speaker 2>Took that guy to guy and there was </v>
<v Speaker 2>another one where he killed a bunch of </v>

1140
00:55:47.711 --> 00:55:52.421
<v Speaker 2>people in Katrina.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a sniper and Katrina would shoot </v>

1141
00:55:52.421 --> 00:55:52.550
<v Speaker 2>shooting looters and talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is like,</v>

1142
00:55:52.940 --> 00:55:57.940
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's one thing if you're shooting </v>

1143
00:55:57.940 --> 00:55:58.820
<v Speaker 2>terrorists who have rocket launchers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're shooting people that are poor</v>

1144
00:55:58.821 --> 00:56:03.821
<v Speaker 2>people that are stealing shit because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're involved in chaos because the </v>

1145
00:56:03.821 --> 00:56:07.400
<v Speaker 2>fucking water has come and surrounded </v>
<v Speaker 2>the city and there's no resources and so</v>

1146
00:56:07.580 --> 00:56:12.580
<v Speaker 2>you're shooting looters like it should </v>
<v Speaker 2>be really fucking careful about who we </v>

1147
00:56:13.221 --> 00:56:16.100
<v Speaker 2>celebrate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're shooting looters,</v>

1148
00:56:16.180 --> 00:56:17.030
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a murderer.</v>

1149
00:56:17.090 --> 00:56:18.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not talking about war.</v>

1150
00:56:18.741 --> 00:56:23.741
<v Speaker 2>We're not talking like even Michael </v>
<v Speaker 2>Moore was talking about his pollutant </v>

1151
00:56:23.741 --> 00:56:23.900
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not what you get for Luda.</v>

1152
00:56:23.901 --> 00:56:23.980
<v Speaker 2>You</v>

1153
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:26.390
<v Speaker 1>don't get that from God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>

1154
00:56:26.700 --> 00:56:30.160
<v Speaker 1>It's not made for people who want an </v>
<v Speaker 1>agnostic for a judge to say,</v>

1155
00:56:30.960 --> 00:56:32.170
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not only that,</v>

1156
00:56:32.171 --> 00:56:37.171
<v Speaker 1>it's not the fucking roof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be delivered because you </v>

1157
00:56:37.171 --> 00:56:39.070
<v Speaker 1>go to a trial and you have a jury of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your peers.</v>

1158
00:56:39.080 --> 00:56:44.080
<v Speaker 1>That's what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what the government is supposed </v>

1159
00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:44.260
<v Speaker 1>to be established for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to be on a rooftop.</v>

1160
00:56:44.290 --> 00:56:46.970
<v Speaker 1>Then you're just murdering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This movie was like a full liar.</v>

1161
00:56:47.740 --> 00:56:49.020
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1162
00:56:49.030 --> 00:56:52.240
<v Speaker 1>Jesse Ventura fucking navy seal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was in.</v>

1163
00:56:52.241 --> 00:56:54.790
<v Speaker 1>What's called the Udt before it was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>navy seals,</v>

1164
00:56:54.791 --> 00:56:56.500
<v Speaker 1>I believe that's the name of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>organization.</v>

1165
00:56:56.501 --> 00:56:58.960
<v Speaker 1>There was a predating name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same.</v>

1166
00:56:58.990 --> 00:57:00.360
<v Speaker 1>Jesse Ventura was one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1167
00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:05.520
<v Speaker 1>So apparently this guy told the story </v>
<v Speaker 1>about knocking out Jesse Ventura and </v>

1168
00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:07.720
<v Speaker 1>Jesse Ventura badmouthing the troops and</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad mouth no more,</v>

1169
00:57:07.721 --> 00:57:10.060
<v Speaker 1>which he said he would never do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never did,</v>

1170
00:57:10.270 --> 00:57:12.670
<v Speaker 1>never argued with this guy that he never</v>
<v Speaker 1>got hit.</v>

1171
00:57:12.850 --> 00:57:15.670
<v Speaker 1>And he gave the guy an opportunity to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1172
00:57:15.780 --> 00:57:20.780
<v Speaker 1>to tracked it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise he was [inaudible] he wrote </v>

1173
00:57:20.780 --> 00:57:21.280
<v Speaker 1>about in his book he called them scruffy</v>
<v Speaker 1>face or something like that.</v>

1174
00:57:21.460 --> 00:57:24.520
<v Speaker 1>But then on radio shows he admitted that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was Jesse Ventura,</v>

1175
00:57:24.580 --> 00:57:26.980
<v Speaker 1>so can do the math.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he did it on Opie and Anthony.</v>

1176
00:57:26.981 --> 00:57:28.660
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's where it came out.</v>

1177
00:57:28.661 --> 00:57:32.500
<v Speaker 1>So they realize that it's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the guy got killed.</v>

1178
00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:37.800
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris Kyle gets killed and now Jesse </v>

1179
00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:38.770
<v Speaker 1>Ventura goes through with the lawsuit </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the guy's wife,</v>

1180
00:57:39.490 --> 00:57:41.440
<v Speaker 1>which that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See?</v>

1181
00:57:41.470 --> 00:57:42.850
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's got all the profits from the.</v>

1182
00:57:42.910 --> 00:57:47.910
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck her off the fucking lie about him </v>

1183
00:57:47.910 --> 00:57:50.260
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then she started saying,</v>

1184
00:57:50.261 --> 00:57:52.060
<v Speaker 1>I give that money to charity and then it</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes out later.</v>

1185
00:57:52.061 --> 00:57:53.900
<v Speaker 1>She's a liar too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She kept 20 percent of it.</v>

1186
00:57:55.210 --> 00:58:00.210
<v Speaker 1>I think as long as her look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if her why should life isn't.</v>

1187
00:58:00.520 --> 00:58:03.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's suing the guy who lied.</v>

1188
00:58:04.030 --> 00:58:06.190
<v Speaker 1>It just so happened to the guy who lied,</v>
<v Speaker 1>died,</v>

1189
00:58:06.780 --> 00:58:11.780
<v Speaker 1>let's stop selling the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's the issue because you're </v>

1190
00:58:11.780 --> 00:58:11.780
<v Speaker 1>dead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1191
00:58:11.780 --> 00:58:12.820
<v Speaker 1>You're dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to the issue on the book.</v>

1192
00:58:12.821 --> 00:58:15.880
<v Speaker 1>Random guys like who owns the book?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who put but.</v>

1193
00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:21.120
<v Speaker 1>But then the issue is does he represent </v>
<v Speaker 1>them when he goes on radio stations and </v>

1194
00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:21.700
<v Speaker 1>says something that's not even in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>

1195
00:58:21.850 --> 00:58:23.650
<v Speaker 1>Does he name the guy in the story in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>

1196
00:58:23.651 --> 00:58:28.651
<v Speaker 1>but does that make them responsible?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say it doesn't say it's not random </v>

1197
00:58:28.651 --> 00:58:29.980
<v Speaker 1>house because he said scruffy face with </v>
<v Speaker 1>a.</v>

1198
00:58:30.390 --> 00:58:33.070
<v Speaker 1>But then when he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I've told you it was graffiti faces.</v>

1199
00:58:33.071 --> 00:58:35.770
<v Speaker 1>Now what you've printed label or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever is the thing man,</v>

1200
00:58:35.771 --> 00:58:40.771
<v Speaker 1>if he wrote about all that other shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>about shooting looters and all that </v>

1201
00:58:40.771 --> 00:58:40.780
<v Speaker 1>other shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if that turns out to be not true,</v>

1202
00:58:40.810 --> 00:58:43.510
<v Speaker 1>which people are saying it's not true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really got to take the whole book.</v>

1203
00:58:43.510 --> 00:58:48.510
<v Speaker 1>Took the book off like this is what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>important to separate had that book,</v>

1204
00:58:48.701 --> 00:58:50.310

<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1206
00:58:51.541 --> 00:58:52.480
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

1207
00:58:52.481 --> 00:58:53.590
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was all a lie and she was like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Because again,</v>

<v Speaker 1>He just said he went to heaven and he's.</v>

1210
00:58:57.190 --> 00:58:58.990
<v Speaker 1>He came out and said the whole thing was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lie.</v>

1211
00:58:59.260 --> 00:59:00.580
<v Speaker 1>You know that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1212
00:59:01.010 --> 00:59:03.160
<v Speaker 1>They pulled that book too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They went to heaven.</v>

1213
00:59:03.490 --> 00:59:03.820
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1214
00:59:03.821 --> 00:59:07.390
<v Speaker 1>there's this cheesy buck where a kid </v>
<v Speaker 1>goes into a coma,</v>

1215
00:59:07.700 --> 00:59:11.490
<v Speaker 1>flies around having for awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes back right to this best seller.</v>

1216
00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:16.500
<v Speaker 1>People are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew everyone was real and I knew it </v>

1217
00:59:16.500 --> 00:59:16.500
<v Speaker 1>was like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never read it,</v>

1218
00:59:16.500 --> 00:59:17.910
<v Speaker 1>but it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just the La area,</v>

1219
00:59:18.190 --> 00:59:22.220
<v Speaker 1>but the kid got religion actually got </v>
<v Speaker 1>religion was and felt</v>

1220
00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:24.860
<v Speaker 4>so guilty about wanting that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He came out and said the whole thing was</v>

1221
00:59:24.861 --> 00:59:26.420
<v Speaker 4>alive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I could get attention.</v>

1222
00:59:26.610 --> 00:59:27.800
<v Speaker 4>It's not real great.</v>

1223
00:59:27.910 --> 00:59:30.310
<v Speaker 2>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the Nicole that there's a great,</v>

1224
00:59:30.820 --> 00:59:35.820
<v Speaker 2>there's a great blog that I read called </v>
<v Speaker 2>a if you just google truth justice and </v>

1225
00:59:35.891 --> 00:59:38.420
<v Speaker 2>the curious case of Chris Kyle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really,</v>

1226
00:59:38.590 --> 00:59:43.590
<v Speaker 2>really well written.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wrote which explains all of the </v>

1227
00:59:43.590 --> 00:59:48.180
<v Speaker 2>various stories and here's why they </v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't be true and here he's not </v>

1228
00:59:48.180 --> 00:59:49.900
<v Speaker 2>casting a judgment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not using the inflammatory language.</v>

1229
00:59:50.050 --> 00:59:55.050
<v Speaker 2>Just trying to explain like what may be </v>
<v Speaker 2>or may not have been true said in the </v>

1230
00:59:55.050 --> 00:59:55.780
<v Speaker 2>beginning of this movie that was just </v>
<v Speaker 2>released.</v>

1231
00:59:55.810 --> 00:59:59.860
<v Speaker 2>This is all a true story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of it I'm sure was.</v>

1232
01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:02.090
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy that the shoot some kid and they</v>

1233
01:00:02.091 --> 01:00:03.340
<v Speaker 2>go like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're wrong about this,</v>

1234
01:00:03.341 --> 01:00:08.341
<v Speaker 2>you'll find that your spotter spotter is</v>
<v Speaker 2>telling you you're going to go to jail </v>

1235
01:00:08.341 --> 01:00:12.781
<v Speaker 2>forever if you take this wrong shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another thing you have to remember too </v>

1236
01:00:12.781 --> 01:00:13.630
<v Speaker 2>is Clint Eastwood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Clint Eastwood,</v>

1237
01:00:13.631 --> 01:00:16.420
<v Speaker 2>who used to be the baddest motherfucker </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm done now.</v>

1238
01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:20.080
<v Speaker 2>He's an old dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Talk to the chair.</v>

1239
01:00:21.630 --> 01:00:23.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are dressed.</v>

1240
01:00:23.411 --> 01:00:23.920
<v Speaker 2>Obama.</v>

1241
01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:26.300
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you direct a movie?</v>

1242
01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:27.950
<v Speaker 4>When I saw the thing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1243
01:00:27.980 --> 01:00:29.780
<v Speaker 4>seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I saw the thing.</v>

1244
01:00:29.930 --> 01:00:30.770
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought was,</v>

1245
01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:35.800
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is just clearly wartime propaganda </v>

1246
01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:38.700
<v Speaker 4>tweeted that he considered,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he compared it to the sniper movie and I</v>

1247
01:00:38.701 --> 01:00:41.780
<v Speaker 4>Tarantino's movie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think Rogan backpedaled a little bit,</v>

1248
01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:46.610
<v Speaker 4>but in Tarantino's movie inglorious </v>
<v Speaker 4>bastards there watching this in Germany,</v>

1249
01:00:46.611 --> 01:00:51.611
<v Speaker 4>they're watching a movie about a sniper </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's being celebrated propaganda.</v>

1250
01:00:52.670 --> 01:00:55.790
<v Speaker 4>It's propaganda.</v>
<v Speaker 4>American sniper is propaganda.</v>

1251
01:00:55.791 --> 01:00:58.070
<v Speaker 4>There's no question about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so we know that.</v>

1252
01:00:58.280 --> 01:00:59.150
<v Speaker 4>Then I was thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1253
01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:04.200
<v Speaker 4>let's make this shot of Clint Eastwood </v>
<v Speaker 4>really direct this because when you see </v>

1254
01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:04.250
<v Speaker 4>him at the Republican National </v>
<v Speaker 4>Convention,</v>

1255
01:01:04.430 --> 01:01:08.360
<v Speaker 4>he seemed kind of like out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so then I was thinking,</v>

1256
01:01:08.361 --> 01:01:13.361
<v Speaker 4>how the fuck is this guy directing like </v>
<v Speaker 4>this kind of hardcore action forum and </v>

1257
01:01:13.361 --> 01:01:16.700
<v Speaker 4>the vase there because he's this manly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rugged,</v>

1258
01:01:16.701 --> 01:01:21.701
<v Speaker 4>right wing Republican hero,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they knew that that would like get </v>

1259
01:01:21.701 --> 01:01:25.181
<v Speaker 4>more people to watch this movie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is essentially a lubricated water </v>

1260
01:01:25.181 --> 01:01:27.440
<v Speaker 4>slide that leads to your nearest </v>
<v Speaker 4>recruiting office.</v>

1261
01:01:27.590 --> 01:01:29.600
<v Speaker 4>If you get hypnotized by the thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>enough,</v>

1262
01:01:29.780 --> 01:01:30.670
<v Speaker 4>that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1263
01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:35.700
<v Speaker 4>you want to fight it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want to fight for justice and I'll </v>

1264
01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:35.700
<v Speaker 4>tell you this now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1265
01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:35.700
<v Speaker 2>you want to be noble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what,</v>

1266
01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:37.020
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to work in the oil </v>
<v Speaker 2>fields.</v>

1267
01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:39.840
<v Speaker 2>You want to be noble straight to seal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was 30.</v>

1268
01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:42.510
<v Speaker 2>Think about a lot of people that are in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this country that are.</v>

1269
01:01:42.570 --> 01:01:47.570
<v Speaker 2>You got boring as shit town with no </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking opportunity and you're </v>

1270
01:01:47.570 --> 01:01:51.260
<v Speaker 2>surrounded by a bunch of dummies and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then you go see this movie and you're </v>

1271
01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:51.260
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

1272
01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:53.460
<v Speaker 2>But I think when you make a movie about </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone's life story,</v>

1273
01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:56.970
<v Speaker 2>and this is what I was pissed off at Fox</v>
<v Speaker 2>catcher for the same reason,</v>

1274
01:01:57.210 --> 01:02:02.210
<v Speaker 2>that movie foxcatcher about a John </v>
<v Speaker 2>Dupont who was that crazy old man who </v>

1275
01:02:02.210 --> 01:02:06.560
<v Speaker 2>shot a Dave Schultz who's an Olympic </v>
<v Speaker 2>champion wrestler and it was based on </v>

1276
01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:10.941
<v Speaker 2>his brother Mark Schultz in this one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They fucked with everything in that </v>

1277
01:02:10.941 --> 01:02:10.941
<v Speaker 2>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They.</v>

1278
01:02:10.941 --> 01:02:15.110
<v Speaker 2>He's so angry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's been Mark Schultz have been </v>

1279
01:02:15.110 --> 01:02:15.110
<v Speaker 2>tweeting like crazy because he's still </v>
<v Speaker 2>alive.</v>

1280
01:02:15.270 --> 01:02:17.410
<v Speaker 2>He's an Olympic gold medalist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that.</v>

1281
01:02:17.690 --> 01:02:18.900
<v Speaker 2>It killed him in the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1282
01:02:18.930 --> 01:02:19.330
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1283
01:02:19.350 --> 01:02:19.680
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1284
01:02:19.681 --> 01:02:22.770
<v Speaker 2>John Dupont killed the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an Olympic gold medalist in the movie,</v>

1285
01:02:23.010 --> 01:02:24.900
<v Speaker 2>but his brother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mark Schultz,</v>

1286
01:02:24.901 --> 01:02:28.560
<v Speaker 2>who the book the movie and the book is </v>
<v Speaker 2>based on is still alive and they changed</v>

1287
01:02:28.561 --> 01:02:31.470
<v Speaker 2>all these aspects of his life for this </v>
<v Speaker 2>movie and he's like,</v>

1288
01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:34.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm still alive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is me.</v>

1289
01:02:34.740 --> 01:02:39.740
<v Speaker 2>Like this isn't like a Chris Kyle thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>where they made the movie after he's </v>

1290
01:02:39.740 --> 01:02:40.520
<v Speaker 2>dead and who knows what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1291
01:02:40.530 --> 01:02:43.290
<v Speaker 2>he let put in and not put.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is like mark was saying,</v>

1292
01:02:43.470 --> 01:02:48.470
<v Speaker 2>this didn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they messed with shit that didn't </v>

1293
01:02:48.470 --> 01:02:48.470
<v Speaker 2>even make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they had the UFC in their movie,</v>

1294
01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:52.450
<v Speaker 2>but it was in 1988.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was no fucking UFC until 1993.</v>

1295
01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:57.600
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're watching an actual fight </v>

1296
01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:01.400
<v Speaker 2>between big daddy goodrich who was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>eventual opponent of Mark Schultz and a </v>

1297
01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:01.620
<v Speaker 2>lot of people like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're real good.</v>

1298
01:03:01.870 --> 01:03:04.260
<v Speaker 2>You're all read true view.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody gives a shit.</v>

1299
01:03:04.261 --> 01:03:05.040
<v Speaker 2>It's a both.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The story.</v>

1300
01:03:05.190 --> 01:03:06.360
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not dummy.</v>

1301
01:03:06.390 --> 01:03:11.390
<v Speaker 2>It's about history because why would you</v>
<v Speaker 2>make up any aspects of history when </v>

1302
01:03:11.390 --> 01:03:15.060
<v Speaker 2>you're doing a true story and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>need to change the timeline for the UFC.</v>

1303
01:03:15.150 --> 01:03:20.150
<v Speaker 2>That's totally arbitrary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like someone deciding to do that is </v>

1304
01:03:20.150 --> 01:03:21.890
<v Speaker 2>their own creative flair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just kissing,</v>

1305
01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:25.170
<v Speaker 2>just comping their balls and jizzing </v>
<v Speaker 2>over history.</v>

1306
01:03:25.380 --> 01:03:30.380
<v Speaker 2>If you did that with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How the fuck am I going to believe any </v>

1307
01:03:30.380 --> 01:03:30.380
<v Speaker 2>of the aspects of the story because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>lied about something.</v>

1308
01:03:30.380 --> 01:03:35.211
<v Speaker 2>I know you lied about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is weird shit where there's like </v>

1309
01:03:35.211 --> 01:03:38.210
<v Speaker 2>there's like this weird relationship </v>
<v Speaker 2>between the two and they're looking at </v>

1310
01:03:38.210 --> 01:03:40.080
<v Speaker 2>each other weird and he's wearing shorts</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now he's got frosted tips and people</v>

1311
01:03:40.081 --> 01:03:45.081
<v Speaker 2>were saying that it seemed like it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>gay and shoulds got really upset that </v>

1312
01:03:45.081 --> 01:03:45.960
<v Speaker 2>they were insinuating there was some </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of a gay relationship.</v>

1313
01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:51.320
<v Speaker 2>They like fucked with the timeline of </v>
<v Speaker 2>his achievements too because he had </v>

1314
01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:55.371
<v Speaker 2>already won the world championships.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he was already the best wrestler </v>

1315
01:03:55.371 --> 01:03:55.650
<v Speaker 2>in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in his weight class and they were making</v>

1316
01:03:55.651 --> 01:03:58.910
<v Speaker 2>it look like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he needed his brother and he was.</v>

1317
01:03:58.911 --> 01:04:00.720
<v Speaker 2>He was sucking in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dupont was,</v>

1318
01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:05.920
<v Speaker 2>his career was falling apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was the best wrestler in his weight </v>

1319
01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:05.920
<v Speaker 2>class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the word mark.</v>

1320
01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:10.551
<v Speaker 2>Fucking show was an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you watch him wrestle when he was at </v>

1321
01:04:10.551 --> 01:04:15.381
<v Speaker 2>his peak form,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a fucking animal and like the </v>

1322
01:04:15.381 --> 01:04:18.540
<v Speaker 2>changed like the aspects of his </v>
<v Speaker 2>achievements in this movie,</v>

1323
01:04:18.541 --> 01:04:23.541
<v Speaker 2>like he was already a world champion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the way they made it and the way </v>

1324
01:04:23.541 --> 01:04:24.930
<v Speaker 2>they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the guy was fucked and nothing</v>

1325
01:04:24.931 --> 01:04:29.931
<v Speaker 2>was going right for him and then he </v>
<v Speaker 2>needed this John Dupont situation and </v>

1326
01:04:29.931 --> 01:04:31.250
<v Speaker 2>that's why he moved in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a beautiful mind when,</v>

1327
01:04:31.270 --> 01:04:32.640
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the wife stuck with them,</v>

1328
01:04:32.641 --> 01:04:33.770
<v Speaker 2>even though it was going crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1329
01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:35.220
<v Speaker 2>The real life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She just left.</v>

1330
01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:40.280
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>soon as you run the bath water in the </v>

1331
01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:40.280
<v Speaker 2>kitchen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1332

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1334
01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:41.220

<v Speaker 3>we're going to make it together.</v>

1335

<v Speaker 1>I'm not a huge fan of is this is a </v>

1353
01:05:32.341 --> 01:05:36.931
<v Speaker 1>tricky way to say it because like I </v>

<v Speaker 1>This is great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dustin Hoffman movie,</v>

<v Speaker 1>real comic.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Whatever you fill in has got to be </v>

1373
01:06:26.321 --> 01:06:29.140
<v Speaker 1>directly related to everything that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely know happen,</v>

1374
01:06:29.290 --> 01:06:30.370
<v Speaker 1>but you're not going to have to fill in </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

1375
01:06:30.371 --> 01:06:32.440
<v Speaker 1>Like when he tells his wife he loves her</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the first time,</v>

1376
01:06:32.441 --> 01:06:32.980
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's your,</v>

1377
01:06:32.981 --> 01:06:34.980
<v Speaker 1>like I'm guessing this heart one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fine.</v>

1378
01:06:35.060 --> 01:06:38.560
<v Speaker 1>Unless the wife's alive and she can tell</v>
<v Speaker 1>you that could help.</v>

1379
01:06:38.950 --> 01:06:43.950
<v Speaker 1>But I think what you're talking about is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a controversial subject.</v>

1380
01:06:44.290 --> 01:06:48.300
<v Speaker 1>I think some people say that you got </v>
<v Speaker 1>creative license when things,</v>

1381
01:06:48.330 --> 01:06:50.020
<v Speaker 1>and you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>based on a true story,</v>

1382
01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:55.040
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a true story would look he's Ra </v>

1383
01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:57.100
<v Speaker 1>Ra all the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a flag waving old man.</v>

1384
01:06:57.610 --> 01:06:59.590
<v Speaker 1>He really is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All those old men stick together.</v>

1385
01:06:59.770 --> 01:07:01.060
<v Speaker 1>We'll look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this is.</v>

1386
01:07:01.061 --> 01:07:02.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does it look.</v>

1387
01:07:03.100 --> 01:07:05.440
<v Speaker 1>I think Howard Stern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just saying he enjoyed it as a movie.</v>

1388
01:07:05.441 --> 01:07:08.800
<v Speaker 1>It's supposed to be a very good movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like well made as a movie.</v>

1389
01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:13.990
<v Speaker 1>There was no story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The acting was horrible.</v>

1390
01:07:14.170 --> 01:07:17.440
<v Speaker 1>There were some cool shit like fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>sleeping shots.</v>

1391
01:07:17.780 --> 01:07:22.320
<v Speaker 1>This thing was cool and that was it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't much labeled.</v>

1392
01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:27.600
<v Speaker 1>He's not like a war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the one victim of bad guy wants to </v>

1393
01:07:27.731 --> 01:07:29.330
<v Speaker 1>get the whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I don't understand.</v>

1394
01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:31.110
<v Speaker 1>It's down to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1395
01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:33.030
<v Speaker 1>I think I've sat on the podcast called </v>
<v Speaker 1>Atlanta.</v>

1396
01:07:33.070 --> 01:07:36.010
<v Speaker 1>Here's what it boils down to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to use military equipment,</v>

1397
01:07:36.011 --> 01:07:37.090
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a movie.</v>

1398
01:07:37.450 --> 01:07:40.340
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to get your own fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>tanks and where are you going to get the</v>

1399
01:07:40.341 --> 01:07:45.341
<v Speaker 1>military equipment from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get the military </v>

1400
01:07:45.341 --> 01:07:47.050
<v Speaker 1>equipment from the military and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>military and you can load that's over on</v>

1401
01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:49.270
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get to have script approval,</v>

1402
01:07:49.420 --> 01:07:54.420
<v Speaker 1>so the military,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they look through your script and they </v>

1403
01:07:54.420 --> 01:07:56.821
<v Speaker 1>make sure that the staff that is in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>script is going to get people down to </v>

1404
01:07:56.821 --> 01:07:59.990
<v Speaker 1>their local recruiting office and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>why they let you use their machinery.</v>

1405
01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:04.450
<v Speaker 1>Don't use it to send them to cooper that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's never been an antiwar movie that</v>

1406
01:08:04.451 --> 01:08:08.340
<v Speaker 1>hasn't made an enlistment go up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Antiwar movie.</v>

1407
01:08:08.410 --> 01:08:13.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You feel like you literally cannot make </v>

1408
01:08:13.410 --> 01:08:14.560
<v Speaker 1>an antiwar movie because every single </v>
<v Speaker 1>depiction of war makes people go,</v>

1409
01:08:14.590 --> 01:08:15.130
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's cool.</v>

1410
01:08:15.170 --> 01:08:15.950
<v Speaker 1>Like platoon,</v>

1411
01:08:16.490 --> 01:08:17.570
<v Speaker 4>all of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of it.</v>

1412
01:08:17.571 --> 01:08:22.571
<v Speaker 4>You can see the trend right afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Enlistments shoots up after those big </v>

1413
01:08:22.571 --> 01:08:23.870
<v Speaker 4>movies tell you see the same front of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Ryan.</v>

1414
01:08:23.871 --> 01:08:25.520
<v Speaker 4>The guy gets blown up the close night,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but everyone's like,</v>

1415
01:08:25.580 --> 01:08:28.250
<v Speaker 4>I want to be a sniper.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You forget the fact they got blown up.</v>

1416
01:08:28.251 --> 01:08:33.251
<v Speaker 4>His people like being violent and this </v>
<v Speaker 4>is why Sebastian younger's book war is </v>

1417
01:08:33.251 --> 01:08:37.301
<v Speaker 4>such an incredible book because it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It portrays war with no attempt to be </v>

1418
01:08:37.911 --> 01:08:39.440
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is right or this is wrong.</v>

1419
01:08:39.620 --> 01:08:41.750
<v Speaker 4>It just says if you take it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't remember the exact wording,</v>

1420
01:08:41.751 --> 01:08:46.751
<v Speaker 4>but it's like if you take a 22 year old </v>
<v Speaker 4>and put them behind one of those giant </v>

1421
01:08:46.751 --> 01:08:48.270
<v Speaker 4>fucking southern.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1422
01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:51.620
<v Speaker 4>it feels good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's fun to like.</v>

1423
01:08:52.730 --> 01:08:55.460
<v Speaker 4>It feels like that's Bob.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He pulled love violence.</v>

1424
01:08:55.580 --> 01:09:00.580
<v Speaker 4>So if you can figure out a way to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>people to be violent without the guilt </v>

1425
01:09:01.221 --> 01:09:06.221
<v Speaker 4>that goes along with like you're killing</v>
<v Speaker 4>other members of your species than what </v>

1426
01:09:06.221 --> 01:09:06.230
<v Speaker 4>do you do.</v>

1427
01:09:06.350 --> 01:09:08.720
<v Speaker 4>You create an imaginary story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

1428
01:09:08.810 --> 01:09:12.200
<v Speaker 4>and the imaginary story in Iraq was the </v>
<v Speaker 4>weapons of mass destruction.</v>

1429
01:09:12.380 --> 01:09:14.380
<v Speaker 4>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Saddam Hussein,</v>

1430
01:09:14.460 --> 01:09:15.750
<v Speaker 4>what they said this movie like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1431
01:09:16.220 --> 01:09:18.860
<v Speaker 4>if I don't do my job to come to San </v>
<v Speaker 4>Diego and then knock on your door.</v>

1432
01:09:19.730 --> 01:09:24.730
<v Speaker 4>Apparently another aspect of the book </v>
<v Speaker 4>that has been the question is that the,</v>

1433
01:09:25.721 --> 01:09:28.910
<v Speaker 4>the barrels of weapons of mass </v>
<v Speaker 4>destruction that they found,</v>

1434
01:09:29.180 --> 01:09:31.790
<v Speaker 4>like he said that they found like </v>
<v Speaker 4>chemical weapons.</v>

1435
01:09:31.930 --> 01:09:32.660
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

1436
01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:38.040
<v Speaker 4>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said we actually saw them laid eyes </v>

1437
01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:38.040
<v Speaker 4>on them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're like,</v>

1438
01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:38.040
<v Speaker 4>well then why don't you tell anybody </v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

1439
01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:39.110
<v Speaker 4>what do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where's the enrichment?</v>

1440
01:09:39.150 --> 01:09:44.150
<v Speaker 4>Google search,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do a google search on birth defects in </v>

1441
01:09:44.150 --> 01:09:47.231
<v Speaker 4>some of the parts of Iraq that we attack</v>
<v Speaker 4>because we used a shells that had some </v>

1442
01:09:47.231 --> 01:09:51.350
<v Speaker 4>kind of radioactive isotope in it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>now the babies are being born with birth</v>

1443
01:09:51.351 --> 01:09:56.351
<v Speaker 4>defects because the other thing people </v>
<v Speaker 4>say is Saddam Hussein gas his own </v>

1444
01:09:56.351 --> 01:09:56.351
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1445
01:09:56.351 --> 01:09:58.540
<v Speaker 4>He gets his own people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1446
01:09:58.620 --> 01:10:01.580
<v Speaker 4>what are we doing to them?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we're dropping all these bombs.</v>

1447
01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:03.140
<v Speaker 4>Targeted strikes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1448
01:10:03.141 --> 01:10:05.000
<v Speaker 4>They know exactly where they're heading.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1449
01:10:05.001 --> 01:10:06.170
<v Speaker 4>they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People,</v>

1450
01:10:06.230 --> 01:10:10.850
<v Speaker 4>babies are being born with severe birth </v>
<v Speaker 4>defects because of what we did there.</v>

1451
01:10:10.851 --> 01:10:15.110
<v Speaker 4>So I think in a movie like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you need to at least illustrate the fact</v>

1452
01:10:15.290 --> 01:10:20.290
<v Speaker 4>that the reason that man was sitting on </v>
<v Speaker 4>the tops of buildings in that area,</v>

1453
01:10:20.570 --> 01:10:22.130
<v Speaker 4>killing them people was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was,</v>

1454
01:10:22.460 --> 01:10:27.460
<v Speaker 4>was because he was sent there based on </v>
<v Speaker 4>bad information to say the least.</v>

1455
01:10:27.990 --> 01:10:30.530
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the people he's killing,</v>

1456
01:10:30.620 --> 01:10:33.710
<v Speaker 4>like in the very beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like anybody over the age of 18,</v>

1457
01:10:33.860 --> 01:10:38.060
<v Speaker 4>this is anybody over the age of 18 in </v>
<v Speaker 4>this area.</v>

1458
01:10:38.090 --> 01:10:42.350
<v Speaker 4>This is an evacuation zone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's no one except people that are</v>

1459
01:10:42.351 --> 01:10:43.940
<v Speaker 4>out to kill us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all open game.</v>

1460
01:10:43.941 --> 01:10:44.900
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh wait a minute.</v>

1461
01:10:44.900 --> 01:10:46.760
<v Speaker 4>So you're saying that because the first </v>
<v Speaker 4>shot,</v>

1462
01:10:46.761 --> 01:10:51.761
<v Speaker 4>so don't worry about this question,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but morally know anyone who was there </v>

1463
01:10:51.761 --> 01:10:52.250
<v Speaker 4>over 18,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what they're there for.</v>

1464
01:10:52.370 --> 01:10:56.420
<v Speaker 4>Monsters did not leave the city that we </v>
<v Speaker 4>bombed,</v>

1465
01:10:56.630 --> 01:11:00.290
<v Speaker 4>that they lived in when we told them to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if they're still here,</v>

1466
01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:03.260
<v Speaker 4>kill and then still like shows </v>
<v Speaker 4>restraint.</v>

1467
01:11:03.340 --> 01:11:04.670
<v Speaker 4>And then when he found the house,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a kid,</v>

1468
01:11:04.671 --> 01:11:09.671
<v Speaker 4>but he has a fucking grenade launcher.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He waits until the kids running at the </v>

1469
01:11:09.671 --> 01:11:10.730
<v Speaker 4>fuck is about to throw it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then he shoots him.</v>

1470
01:11:11.150 --> 01:11:13.590
<v Speaker 4>But it's totally just shooting kid.</v>

1471
01:11:14.180 --> 01:11:15.780
<v Speaker 2>And then the mom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck</v>

1472
01:11:15.790 --> 01:11:17.560
<v Speaker 4>and wait.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But why would they be angry?</v>

1473
01:11:17.561 --> 01:11:19.150
<v Speaker 4>I mean really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why would you be angry?</v>

1474
01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:21.820
<v Speaker 4>They only destroyed your city that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>lived in.</v>

1475
01:11:22.060 --> 01:11:25.210
<v Speaker 4>This is another thing of why we </v>
<v Speaker 4>shouldn't marines.</v>

1476
01:11:25.810 --> 01:11:28.030
<v Speaker 4>Why the Marines right there where they </v>
<v Speaker 4>can get shot,</v>

1477
01:11:28.610 --> 01:11:31.390
<v Speaker 4>remember thousands of miles away back to</v>
<v Speaker 4>America.</v>

1478
01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:37.640
<v Speaker 2>Well we were saying earlier about </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideologies are the problem and being a </v>

1479
01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:40.030
<v Speaker 2>nationalistic person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>subscribing and being a patriot,</v>

1480
01:11:40.031 --> 01:11:43.870
<v Speaker 2>subscribing to one nation only </v>
<v Speaker 2>regardless of what the actual act itself</v>

1481
01:11:43.871 --> 01:11:45.510
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Looking at it like this.</v>

1482
01:11:45.580 --> 01:11:50.580
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it's one of the books like that </v>

1483
01:11:50.580 --> 01:11:50.580
<v Speaker 2>is an ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>

1484
01:11:50.580 --> 01:11:51.910
<v Speaker 2>That is as much of an ideology as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>religion.</v>

1485
01:11:52.330 --> 01:11:54.470
<v Speaker 2>It's an unquestioning thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1486
01:11:54.790 --> 01:11:56.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that Michael Moore was</v>

1487
01:11:56.501 --> 01:11:59.050
<v Speaker 2>saying was that he put it on his </v>
<v Speaker 2>twitter,</v>

1488
01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:02.710
<v Speaker 2>his twitter that a sniper as a coward </v>
<v Speaker 2>and everybody got really pissed off.</v>

1489
01:12:03.070 --> 01:12:04.780
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>

1490
01:12:04.781 --> 01:12:07.090
<v Speaker 2>I think the logic behind is kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>silly.</v>

1491
01:12:07.270 --> 01:12:09.010
<v Speaker 2>Like you have to look them in the eye </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you shoot him.</v>

1492
01:12:09.011 --> 01:12:10.990
<v Speaker 2>Like shooting someone in the back is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>coward.</v>

1493
01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:16.200
<v Speaker 2>Like well in that sense 90 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 2>war is cowardly because you're,</v>

1494
01:12:16.201 --> 01:12:17.840
<v Speaker 2>you're saying some kind of wars.</v>

1495
01:12:17.890 --> 01:12:20.020
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But some kind of what you have rules.</v>

1496
01:12:20.050 --> 01:12:20.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1497
01:12:20.750 --> 01:12:23.800
<v Speaker 2>Look at somebody with or the back or </v>
<v Speaker 2>like what about a from 100 yards?</v>

1498
01:12:23.820 --> 01:12:25.690
<v Speaker 2>How about rock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that means no more rockets.</v>

1499
01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:30.880
<v Speaker 2>That means a lot of them want to do is </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're shooting people like you don't </v>

1500
01:12:31.301 --> 01:12:33.250
<v Speaker 2>necessarily look them in the eye when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you shoot them.</v>

1501
01:12:33.251 --> 01:12:35.270
<v Speaker 2>Are you having a dual?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what are you doing?</v>

1502
01:12:35.300 --> 01:12:38.110
<v Speaker 2>Standing back to back and walking 10 </v>
<v Speaker 2>paces like assholes,</v>

1503
01:12:38.111 --> 01:12:39.550
<v Speaker 2>like what kind of is the reason to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>there?</v>

1504
01:12:39.551 --> 01:12:42.040
<v Speaker 2>Can you look at some of the negative </v>
<v Speaker 2>effects that we want to pull those back?</v>

1505
01:12:42.290 --> 01:12:46.360
<v Speaker 2>Like what if 30 percent of children the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Yemen have ptsd now because of drones?</v>

1506
01:12:46.940 --> 01:12:51.940
<v Speaker 4>I can't say that's a negative.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really important that that </v>

1507
01:12:51.940 --> 01:12:54.851
<v Speaker 4>information gets out there when you are </v>
<v Speaker 4>putting a movie out that's going to get </v>

1508
01:12:54.851 --> 01:12:59.171
<v Speaker 4>people in the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when Beverly Hills Chihuahua came </v>

1509
01:12:59.171 --> 01:13:01.961
<v Speaker 4>out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody bought a Chihuahua and the </v>

1510
01:13:01.961 --> 01:13:03.830
<v Speaker 4>pounds filled up with your hours because</v>
<v Speaker 4>they also have a sniper.</v>

1511
01:13:03.831 --> 01:13:08.270
<v Speaker 4>Is gonna do the exact same thing for </v>
<v Speaker 4>people who are a little confused on what</v>

1512
01:13:08.271 --> 01:13:10.130
<v Speaker 4>to do in their lives and they're going </v>
<v Speaker 4>to think,</v>

1513
01:13:10.131 --> 01:13:15.131
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess the best thing I can do right </v>

1514
01:13:15.131 --> 01:13:16.610
<v Speaker 4>now is kill people that my government </v>
<v Speaker 4>tells me are evil.</v>

1515
01:13:16.611 --> 01:13:21.611
<v Speaker 4>Even though if I study the facts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I find that it's a far more complex </v>

1516
01:13:22.071 --> 01:13:27.071
<v Speaker 4>issue than that and maybe my decision </v>
<v Speaker 4>should not be to become a hired killer </v>

1517
01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:32.440
<v Speaker 4>for people who are telling me that </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually killed people who more than </v>

1518
01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:35.861
<v Speaker 4>likely are innocent or just trying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>defend their home from an invading </v>

1519
01:13:36.321 --> 01:13:37.520
<v Speaker 4>occupying force.</v>

1520
01:13:37.820 --> 01:13:39.560
<v Speaker 4>It's really important to realize that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>

1521
01:13:39.561 --> 01:13:43.670
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying all war is bad because </v>
<v Speaker 4>some people will be like,</v>

1522
01:13:43.671 --> 01:13:45.890
<v Speaker 4>you naive son of a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't even realize.</v>

1523
01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:48.620
<v Speaker 4>Let me repeat the speech.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At the beginning of American sniper,</v>

1524
01:13:48.950 --> 01:13:51.840
<v Speaker 4>this is what the day the speech,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so test.</v>

1525
01:13:51.860 --> 01:13:56.120
<v Speaker 4>Here's the speech the dad gives at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>dinner table after the American sniper.</v>

1526
01:13:56.121 --> 01:13:57.560
<v Speaker 4>What's his name?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chris.</v>

1527
01:13:57.561 --> 01:13:58.860
<v Speaker 4>What was his name?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chris.</v>

1528
01:13:58.861 --> 01:14:03.861
<v Speaker 4>Because Chris Kyle is just defended his </v>
<v Speaker 4>brother from a beating by a bully and </v>

1529
01:14:04.371 --> 01:14:09.371
<v Speaker 4>they're sitting around the table.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His brothers got bruised up a little </v>

1530
01:14:09.371 --> 01:14:12.971
<v Speaker 4>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chris Kyle's sitting there and his dad </v>

1531
01:14:12.971 --> 01:14:12.971
<v Speaker 4>gives this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's three</v>

1532
01:14:12.971 --> 01:14:14.620
<v Speaker 3>types of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hold on before you get the speech.</v>

1533
01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:20.280
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just defending my brother and he </v>

1534
01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:20.280
<v Speaker 3>looks at the little brother with a black</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy and he goes,</v>

1535
01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:20.440
<v Speaker 3>is that true?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1536
01:14:20.470 --> 01:14:22.600
<v Speaker 3>what do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously he has a black guy.</v>

1537
01:14:22.630 --> 01:14:24.080
<v Speaker 3>He just got beat up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

1538
01:14:24.890 --> 01:14:26.620
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What a shitty movie.</v>

1539
01:14:26.621 --> 01:14:27.540
<v Speaker 3>Is that true?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

1540
01:14:27.570 --> 01:14:29.960
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is three tax people in the world.</v>

1541
01:14:30.310 --> 01:14:32.650
<v Speaker 3>Three types.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's sheeps.</v>

1542
01:14:32.890 --> 01:14:36.850
<v Speaker 3>Needs are the people who believe that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there aren't evil people in the world,</v>

1543
01:14:36.851 --> 01:14:39.270
<v Speaker 3>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm paraphrasing your own.</v>

1544
01:14:41.650 --> 01:14:46.650
<v Speaker 3>These are the people who believe that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there aren't even people in the world </v>

1545
01:14:46.650 --> 01:14:49.390
<v Speaker 3>and that everything is safe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then there's the wolfs and these are</v>

1546
01:14:49.391 --> 01:14:54.280
<v Speaker 3>the people who try to use eval to </v>
<v Speaker 3>overpower others,</v>

1547
01:14:54.281 --> 01:14:59.281
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there's the sheep dogs and </v>

1548
01:14:59.281 --> 01:14:59.281
<v Speaker 3>these are the people who defend the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sheep.</v>

1549
01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:01.420
<v Speaker 3>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you going to be?</v>

1550
01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:03.910
<v Speaker 3>It goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're anything,</v>

1551
01:15:03.940 --> 01:15:08.610
<v Speaker 3>if you're the sheep or the wolf,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he took his belt off and puts down,</v>

1552
01:15:08.910 --> 01:15:13.910
<v Speaker 3>will be fucked us up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your us.</v>

1553
01:15:16.030 --> 01:15:16.750
<v Speaker 3>Watch it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1554
01:15:16.751 --> 01:15:19.690
<v Speaker 3>It is from the very beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's pure.</v>

1555
01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:22.520
<v Speaker 3>It really is like the way were talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about how,</v>

1556
01:15:22.590 --> 01:15:23.010
<v Speaker 3>how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1557
01:15:23.110 --> 01:15:25.260
<v Speaker 3>soldiers are on their dying breath will </v>
<v Speaker 3>tell him.</v>

1558
01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:30.360
<v Speaker 3>I'm just glad I got to tell that story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Telling that story.</v>

1559
01:15:36.020 --> 01:15:38.000
<v Speaker 3>Story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>story.</v>

1560
01:15:38.110 --> 01:15:43.110
<v Speaker 3>He told me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember going around telling people </v>

1561
01:15:43.110 --> 01:15:43.110
<v Speaker 3>like y'all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I met his,</v>

1562
01:15:43.110 --> 01:15:43.110
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1563
01:15:43.110 --> 01:15:43.990
<v Speaker 3>his fucking buddies and arms when he was</v>
<v Speaker 3>dying.</v>

1564
01:15:43.991 --> 01:15:44.440
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1565
01:15:44.450 --> 01:15:49.450
<v Speaker 3>I got married and at least I got it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

1566
01:15:56.591 --> 01:15:58.740
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine if that really did </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen though,</v>

1567
01:15:58.750 --> 01:16:03.160
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's Saturday than him lying.</v>

1568
01:16:05.630 --> 01:16:08.980
<v Speaker 3>Assuming it didn't happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but people are definitely dumb enough to</v>

1569
01:16:08.981 --> 01:16:13.981
<v Speaker 3>do that you don't understand about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>punisher tour of was magical.</v>

1570
01:16:17.260 --> 01:16:20.170
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1571
01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:23.530
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Last words,</v>

1572
01:16:23.590 --> 01:16:24.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I'll be like,</v>

1573
01:16:24.461 --> 01:16:26.290
<v Speaker 3>but what about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what about him stealing jokes?</v>

1574
01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:28.450
<v Speaker 3>His last words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he did it better.</v>

1575
01:16:31.170 --> 01:16:33.080
<v Speaker 3>Better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>better,</v>

1576
01:16:34.660 --> 01:16:37.450
<v Speaker 3>different in my country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1577
01:16:39.130 --> 01:16:43.870
<v Speaker 3>Already I will give you $100,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>if on your death bed you say the least,</v>

1578
01:16:43.871 --> 01:16:47.960
<v Speaker 3>I got $200,000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would really give him 100,000</v>

1579
01:16:47.961 --> 01:16:49.060
<v Speaker 3>dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And how would he use it?</v>

1580
01:16:49.061 --> 01:16:52.910
<v Speaker 3>He's dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>

1581
01:16:53.130 --> 01:16:55.870

<v Speaker 3>I got that back by the way,</v>

<v Speaker 1>males.</v>

1595

<v Speaker 1>way to look for non white males.</v>

1596

<v Speaker 1>we'll just going to get to attack.</v>

1599
01:17:44.100 --> 01:17:46.880
<v Speaker 1>If you don't get some others to attack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just like bottom line.</v>

1600
01:17:46.881 --> 01:17:49.570
<v Speaker 1>It was just fucking pissed about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>

1601

<v Speaker 1>You got to be representative.</v>

1603
01:17:54.020 --> 01:17:58.310
<v Speaker 1>That's so crazy about the Oscars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all like all white people.</v>

1604
01:17:59.180 --> 01:18:03.650
<v Speaker 1>Black people are being excluded and less</v>
<v Speaker 1>Asian people are being excluded.</v>

1605
01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:06.500
<v Speaker 1>Joey does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1606
01:18:06.620 --> 01:18:11.620

<v Speaker 1>but you can't have affirmative action </v>

1607
01:18:11.620 --> 01:18:14.190
<v Speaker 1>comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your account,</v>

1608
01:18:14.260 --> 01:18:16.280
<v Speaker 1>you're going to ruin the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't do that.</v>

1609
01:18:16.281 --> 01:18:18.820
<v Speaker 1>You can't like you will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoever's funny you got to say,</v>

1610
01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:19.460
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1611
01:18:19.461 --> 01:18:24.461
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you get what you can do it like </v>

1612
01:18:24.461 --> 01:18:24.461
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like show me the pool of people that are</v>

1613
01:18:24.461 --> 01:18:25.310
<v Speaker 1>qualified and you show them 100 people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like two of those.</v>

1614
01:18:25.490 --> 01:18:27.920
<v Speaker 1>There's only six blacks that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>qualified of those hundreds,</v>

1615
01:18:27.921 --> 01:18:30.530
<v Speaker 1>but pick two of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind being on the Internet.</v>

1616
01:18:30.531 --> 01:18:31.520
<v Speaker 1>I love the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1617
01:18:31.530 --> 01:18:34.940
<v Speaker 1>That's where I live is on the flip side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can be way longer to just like we did</v>

1618
01:18:34.941 --> 01:18:35.900
<v Speaker 1>last year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely,</v>

1619
01:18:35.901 --> 01:18:40.901
<v Speaker 1>like don't worry about any.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one that you put that we did that </v>

1620
01:18:40.901 --> 01:18:40.901
<v Speaker 1>was on the Internet.</v>

1621
01:18:40.901 --> 01:18:41.390
<v Speaker 1>It was great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was fun.</v>

1622
01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:44.390
<v Speaker 1>It was just actually before the show was</v>
<v Speaker 1>even on TV.</v>

1623
01:18:44.620 --> 01:18:46.880
<v Speaker 1>It's totally awesome to have something </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the Internet.</v>

1624
01:18:46.881 --> 01:18:51.800
<v Speaker 1>I was just confused as to the reasoning </v>
<v Speaker 1>for it because it came later to Eric,</v>

1625
01:18:51.801 --> 01:18:52.940
<v Speaker 1>the guy who runs it with me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

1626
01:18:52.970 --> 01:18:53.600
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's do it.</v>

1627
01:18:53.601 --> 01:18:57.590
<v Speaker 1>Also a web series,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the web series and that way goes to.</v>

1628
01:18:57.591 --> 01:19:00.050
<v Speaker 1>It's like if we show some short ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want to bump somebody up.</v>

1629
01:19:00.051 --> 01:19:05.051
<v Speaker 1>We can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they're a good short story Rothbart </v>

1630
01:19:05.051 --> 01:19:05.051
<v Speaker 1>and with Ms Dot Pat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what though?</v>

1631
01:19:05.051 --> 01:19:07.280
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking awesome about the web too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't get canceled.</v>

1632
01:19:07.340 --> 01:19:09.380
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't get canceled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's on anytime you want.</v>

1633
01:19:09.410 --> 01:19:11.900
<v Speaker 1>It's actually a way better medium for </v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution.</v>

1634
01:19:12.350 --> 01:19:14.120
<v Speaker 1>Like a youtube channels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Way Better.</v>

1635

<v Speaker 1>If it's on comedy central,</v>

1640

<v Speaker 1>you're going to be guaranteed a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>large audience,</v>

1641

<v Speaker 1>that aren't even your fans.</v>

1643
01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:39.160
<v Speaker 1>When you get good online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get all of your fans so </v>

<v Speaker 1>they watch it more intently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See your name right there.</v>

1645
01:19:40.221 --> 01:19:42.220
<v Speaker 1>It's way easier for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like to fan wise,</v>

1646
01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:44.950

01:19:45.910 --> 01:19:46.580
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1651
01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:52.200
<v Speaker 1>Also all those stories go on the web.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's make a cool looking clip story </v>

1652
01:19:52.200 --> 01:19:54.290
<v Speaker 1>about trying to buy acid in a parking </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot on tv.</v>

1653
01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:55.540
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like black,</v>

1654
01:19:55.580 --> 01:20:00.580
<v Speaker 1>white one that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>About some sex and a dog is involved and</v>

1655
01:20:00.921 --> 01:20:02.510
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not doing beastiality on here.</v>

1656
01:20:02.980 --> 01:20:04.760
<v Speaker 1>Put It on the web though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like five golden.</v>

1657
01:20:04.761 --> 01:20:06.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As long as that area.</v>

1658
01:20:06.340 --> 01:20:08.040
<v Speaker 1>I just think the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if</v>

1659
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:09.400
<v Speaker 4>I get to choose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1660
01:20:09.450 --> 01:20:12.480
<v Speaker 4>doc had said that because I don't even </v>
<v Speaker 4>want to say like I'd rather be the wet.</v>

1661
01:20:12.481 --> 01:20:13.820
<v Speaker 4>You can say whatever the fuck you want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1662
01:20:13.910 --> 01:20:14.730
<v Speaker 4>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1663
01:20:14.731 --> 01:20:15.690
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because they,</v>

1664
01:20:15.730 --> 01:20:18.570
<v Speaker 4>cause he called me and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can we go through what your story is?</v>

1665
01:20:18.690 --> 01:20:23.690
<v Speaker 4>The idea being if we can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like maybe we can make it so it could </v>

1666
01:20:23.690 --> 01:20:23.690
<v Speaker 4>possibly be on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I said,</v>

1667
01:20:23.690 --> 01:20:28.250
<v Speaker 4>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just rather not be on TV because I </v>

1668
01:20:28.250 --> 01:20:28.410
<v Speaker 4>don't want to deal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to worry about that.</v>

1669
01:20:28.411 --> 01:20:33.411
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to think about that because</v>
<v Speaker 4>the story I'm telling is a story about </v>

1670
01:20:33.411 --> 01:20:36.870
<v Speaker 4>being in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to buy drugs and uh,</v>

1671
01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:41.040
<v Speaker 4>in just the worst slash best acid trip I</v>
<v Speaker 4>ever had in my life.</v>

1672
01:20:41.100 --> 01:20:42.830
<v Speaker 4>You don't even have to worry about </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone going,</v>

1673
01:20:43.090 --> 01:20:48.090
<v Speaker 4>can you make it sound a little less pro </v>
<v Speaker 4>the we won't get into it because I am </v>

1674
01:20:48.090 --> 01:20:52.071
<v Speaker 4>pro lsd and the moment they actually say</v>
<v Speaker 4>that maybe could happen,</v>

1675
01:20:52.650 --> 01:20:54.260
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like my special Ed.</v>

<v Speaker 4>you'll never.</v>

1679
01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:05.580
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing ever bad happened to </v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

1680
01:21:06.180 --> 01:21:07.770

01:21:08.580 --> 01:21:09.630
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1682
01:21:09.631 --> 01:21:11.010

<v Speaker 4>heads.</v>

<v Speaker 4>You're not worried about the </v>
<v Speaker 4>politicians.</v>

1690
01:21:25.860 --> 01:21:28.780
<v Speaker 4>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't be pussies.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I think with mushrooms especially,</v>

1692
01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:34.140
<v Speaker 4>I think mushrooms like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1693
01:21:34.141 --> 01:21:36.270
<v Speaker 4>remember when marijuana was deeply </v>
<v Speaker 4>illegal,</v>

1694
01:21:36.271 --> 01:21:41.271
<v Speaker 4>way back in the day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'd fantasize with your friends about </v>

1695
01:21:41.271 --> 01:21:44.181
<v Speaker 4>the idea of marijuana becoming legalized</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you can see that it could be on the </v>

1696
01:21:44.181 --> 01:21:44.760
<v Speaker 4>horizon maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was still kind of like,</v>

1697
01:21:44.761 --> 01:21:45.750
<v Speaker 4>it's never going to be legal.</v>

1698
01:21:45.750 --> 01:21:49.320
<v Speaker 4>It's a ridiculous dream.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think mushrooms is the new marijuana.</v>

1699
01:21:49.890 --> 01:21:51.780
<v Speaker 4>Mushrooms is gonna.</v>

<v Speaker 4>medication that's given to people to </v>

1704
01:21:59.370 --> 01:22:01.200
<v Speaker 4>They'll wilson once,</v>
<v Speaker 4>once they start realizing that there are</v>

1705
01:22:01.201 --> 01:22:03.480
<v Speaker 4>medical benefits that they're looking </v>
<v Speaker 4>like they're proving that.</v>

1706
01:22:03.481 --> 01:22:05.520
<v Speaker 4>It's like they'll try to separate them </v>
<v Speaker 4>again.</v>

<v Speaker 4>stringent hardcore studies proving that </v>

1712
01:22:22.261 --> 01:22:25.170
<v Speaker 4>many of these psychoactive compounds </v>
<v Speaker 4>have medicinals up.</v>

1713
01:22:25.530 --> 01:22:30.530
<v Speaker 4>Rick Doblin from the Multidisciplinary </v>
<v Speaker 4>Association for Psychedelic studies </v>

1714
01:22:31.050 --> 01:22:34.410
<v Speaker 4>maps.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just they do these like real stuff.</v>

1715
01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:37.470
<v Speaker 4>They will hardcore studies where it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>undeniable,</v>

1716
01:22:37.471 --> 01:22:42.471
<v Speaker 4>oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you know silicide been helps </v>

1717
01:22:42.471 --> 01:22:44.520
<v Speaker 4>longterm smokers quit and when you </v>
<v Speaker 4>compare it to Chantix,</v>

1718
01:22:45.060 --> 01:22:50.060
<v Speaker 4>it's like the silicide minutes a million</v>
<v Speaker 4>times better because it'll help with my </v>

1719
01:22:50.060 --> 01:22:50.430
<v Speaker 4>depression.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1720
01:22:50.431 --> 01:22:51.660
<v Speaker 4>it does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It heals.</v>

1721
01:22:51.661 --> 01:22:56.661
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>
<v Speaker 4>changes the way your brain is </v>

1722
01:22:56.661 --> 01:22:59.211
<v Speaker 4>functioning you the path that you're on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the past year on like someone </v>

1723
01:22:59.211 --> 01:23:04.120
<v Speaker 4>tried to explain this to me once a voice</v>
<v Speaker 4>try to remember the exact way it's </v>

1724
01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:06.250
<v Speaker 4>explained,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that we want to think</v>

1725
01:23:06.250 --> 01:23:10.570
<v Speaker 2>of our moments as being moments </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual unto themselves,</v>

1726
01:23:10.630 --> 01:23:15.630
<v Speaker 2>but they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're a chain of unique moments </v>

1727
01:23:15.630 --> 01:23:19.411
<v Speaker 2>throughout your entire life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your interpretations of those unique </v>

1728
01:23:19.411 --> 01:23:22.531
<v Speaker 2>moments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm paraphrasing the shit out of this </v>

1729
01:23:22.531 --> 01:23:22.531
<v Speaker 2>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>said it,</v>

1730
01:23:22.531 --> 01:23:25.230
<v Speaker 2>and then all of your associations with </v>
<v Speaker 2>life itself that are connected to your </v>

1731
01:23:25.571 --> 01:23:28.000
<v Speaker 2>interpretations of these moments and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then boom,</v>

1732
01:23:28.180 --> 01:23:31.750
<v Speaker 2>here you are today and you want to think</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this is life,</v>

1733
01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:36.960
<v Speaker 2>but it's only life because of all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>pathways that you've carved in the way </v>

1734
01:23:37.061 --> 01:23:40.420
<v Speaker 2>you view the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As soon as you change those pathways,</v>

1735
01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:45.840
<v Speaker 2>you open up a whole new world because </v>
<v Speaker 2>now your associations are different,</v>

1736
01:23:46.420 --> 01:23:51.420
<v Speaker 2>so now your brain's reaction to life </v>
<v Speaker 2>changing your route to work and almost </v>

1737
01:23:51.420 --> 01:23:51.420
<v Speaker 2>saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1738
01:23:51.420 --> 01:23:53.740
<v Speaker 2>look at these stores for your</v>

1739
01:23:53.990 --> 01:23:58.990
<v Speaker 4>in chemistry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's such a great feeling when ever </v>

1740
01:23:58.990 --> 01:24:00.930
<v Speaker 4>any if that happens just slightly </v>
<v Speaker 4>because a lot of people are in a cave in</v>

1741
01:24:00.931 --> 01:24:05.931
<v Speaker 4>situation when it comes to their lives.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're literally buried under a series </v>

1742
01:24:05.931 --> 01:24:10.811
<v Speaker 4>of antiquated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stale symbols that they're looking at </v>

1743
01:24:10.811 --> 01:24:12.710
<v Speaker 4>the universe through and they feel </v>
<v Speaker 4>trapped.</v>

1744
01:24:12.860 --> 01:24:17.860
<v Speaker 4>It's like their shoes are too tight and </v>
<v Speaker 4>if like a psychedelic or meditating too,</v>

1745
01:24:19.011 --> 01:24:24.011
<v Speaker 4>and I really mean that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not just saying that to because of </v>

1746
01:24:24.011 --> 01:24:24.011
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I'm.</v>

1747
01:24:24.011 --> 01:24:25.550
<v Speaker 4>I really think meditation has a very </v>
<v Speaker 4>similar effect,</v>

1748
01:24:25.700 --> 01:24:28.790
<v Speaker 4>but any of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they reset those symbols,</v>

1749
01:24:28.791 --> 01:24:33.791
<v Speaker 4>structures in your brain and if you just</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if you're in a cave in and you get </v>

1750
01:24:33.791 --> 01:24:36.710
<v Speaker 4>an extra inch compared to like being </v>
<v Speaker 4>compressed against the wall,</v>

1751
01:24:36.770 --> 01:24:40.280
<v Speaker 4>that's a big fucking deal man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's slightly percentage difference.</v>

1752
01:24:40.290 --> 01:24:45.290
<v Speaker 4>Change change is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh thank God I'm 13 percent less </v>

1753
01:24:46.161 --> 01:24:48.620
<v Speaker 4>frightened than I was for my entire </v>
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>

1754
01:24:48.710 --> 01:24:52.640
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever heard Tony Robbins talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about changing paths in life is a really</v>

1755
01:24:52.670 --> 01:24:56.120
<v Speaker 2>interesting analogy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He talks about like you're going to cars</v>

1756
01:24:56.300 --> 01:25:01.300
<v Speaker 2>going the exactly saying or a boat or </v>
<v Speaker 2>two boats going exactly the same </v>

1757
01:25:01.300 --> 01:25:04.691
<v Speaker 2>direction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one boat just takes a two degree </v>

1758
01:25:04.691 --> 01:25:04.930
<v Speaker 2>turn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just two degrees here.</v>

1759
01:25:05.180 --> 01:25:09.740
<v Speaker 2>As they go further down the one boat </v>
<v Speaker 2>that took two degree turn is going to go</v>

1760
01:25:09.741 --> 01:25:14.741
<v Speaker 2>wider and wider away from the original </v>
<v Speaker 2>path and that each decision that you </v>

1761
01:25:14.741 --> 01:25:14.741
<v Speaker 2>make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good decision.</v>

1762
01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:19.960
<v Speaker 2>Takes you closer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like even though it's just like you're </v>

1763
01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:21.350
<v Speaker 2>just steering your ship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just dirt as you go out.</v>

1764
01:25:21.650 --> 01:25:26.650
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be a much different path,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much different end than if you just </v>

1765
01:25:26.650 --> 01:25:28.700
<v Speaker 2>stayed on the original path.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's incredible.</v>

1766
01:25:28.930 --> 01:25:31.460
<v Speaker 2>The different and psychedelics makes you</v>
<v Speaker 2>go right.</v>

1767
01:25:31.461 --> 01:25:36.050
<v Speaker 2>Turn Clyde,</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at the.</v>

1768
01:25:36.190 --> 01:25:36.650
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1769
01:25:36.670 --> 01:25:38.240
<v Speaker 2>the currents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Try to bring you back though.</v>

1770
01:25:38.300 --> 01:25:43.300
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well Ego tries to keep the current kind </v>

1771
01:25:43.300 --> 01:25:43.430
<v Speaker 2>of bring it back to where you were gone </v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's got to take them a good.</v>

1772
01:25:43.610 --> 01:25:48.610
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always said get off that current </v>

1773
01:25:48.610 --> 01:25:50.510
<v Speaker 2>doing psychedelics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like pressing the reset button for </v>

1774
01:25:50.510 --> 01:25:50.510
<v Speaker 2>your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like control all the,</v>

1775
01:25:51.220 --> 01:25:56.220
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your desktop reboots and there's only </v>

1776
01:25:56.220 --> 01:25:58.340
<v Speaker 2>one folder on the desktop that desktop </v>
<v Speaker 2>says the folder says my old bullshit and</v>

1777
01:25:58.341 --> 01:26:01.550
<v Speaker 2>you have two choices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Either you just like create a completely</v>

1778
01:26:01.551 --> 01:26:03.320
<v Speaker 2>different desktop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at reality,</v>

1779
01:26:03.500 --> 01:26:08.500
<v Speaker 2>a completely different or open up my old</v>
<v Speaker 2>bullshit and fall back into these </v>

1780
01:26:08.500 --> 01:26:09.770
<v Speaker 2>familiar patterns because they're very </v>
<v Speaker 2>comforting,</v>

1781
01:26:09.980 --> 01:26:14.980
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know in those moments after the </v>

1782
01:26:14.980 --> 01:26:17.711
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic experience are so important </v>
<v Speaker 2>to grab and hang onto because it gives </v>

1783
01:26:17.711 --> 01:26:22.511
<v Speaker 2>you this opportunity to make this new </v>
<v Speaker 2>way of thinking like a part of your </v>

1784
01:26:22.511 --> 01:26:22.880
<v Speaker 2>habit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once you get into that habit,</v>

1785
01:26:22.881 --> 01:26:24.560
<v Speaker 2>whether it's fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1786
01:26:24.561 --> 01:26:29.561
<v Speaker 2>the 30 days or 60 days or 90 days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like people say that once you like have </v>

1787
01:26:29.561 --> 01:26:34.331
<v Speaker 2>a pattern ingrained in how you behave </v>
<v Speaker 2>and think and do it just takes a </v>

1788
01:26:34.331 --> 01:26:38.891
<v Speaker 2>consistent approach to that pattern and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then it becomes like an like a part of </v>

1789
01:26:38.891 --> 01:26:40.250
<v Speaker 2>you like that's why people quit smoking.</v>

1790
01:26:40.250 --> 01:26:43.040
<v Speaker 2>Like get past 90 days and you'll be all </v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1791
01:26:43.050 --> 01:26:44.660
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jews say when you have,</v>

1792
01:26:44.740 --> 01:26:46.500
<v Speaker 4>if you go sit in the same feed three </v>
<v Speaker 4>times,</v>

1793
01:26:46.501 --> 01:26:47.780
<v Speaker 4>he's just keep sitting there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's your,</v>

1794
01:26:47.830 --> 01:26:48.840
<v Speaker 4>that's your do all time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Suit.</v>

1795
01:26:50.060 --> 01:26:52.660
<v Speaker 4>That's smart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Makes Sense.</v>

1796
01:26:53.460 --> 01:26:58.460
<v Speaker 4>When you take a psychedelic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like if your life is a polluted </v>

1797
01:26:58.460 --> 01:26:58.460
<v Speaker 4>city,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what are those polluted like what's</v>

1798
01:26:58.460 --> 01:26:59.610
<v Speaker 4>Detroit?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Detroit,</v>

1799
01:26:59.640 --> 01:27:04.640
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's like the psychedelic all of a </v>

1800
01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:06.060
<v Speaker 4>sudden takes you in a helicopter outside</v>
<v Speaker 4>the pollution and so now you're seeing,</v>

1801
01:27:06.780 --> 01:27:08.460
<v Speaker 4>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the air up here so fresh.</v>

1802
01:27:08.461 --> 01:27:13.461
<v Speaker 4>It's so nice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the thing is helicopters going to </v>

1803
01:27:13.461 --> 01:27:13.461
<v Speaker 4>land,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going to put you back out into your</v>

1804
01:27:13.461 --> 01:27:15.700
<v Speaker 4>city and that's where the job starts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is like,</v>

1805
01:27:15.780 --> 01:27:18.080
<v Speaker 4>shit man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember if the city was wearing</v>

1806
01:27:18.090 --> 01:27:21.330
<v Speaker 4>like how can I clean this fucking thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>up and then that's,</v>

1807
01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:26.360
<v Speaker 4>that's like the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's when you start doing things like </v>

1808
01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:26.360
<v Speaker 4>exercising,</v>
<v Speaker 4>meditating,</v>

1809
01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:30.890
<v Speaker 4>or that's where you like create just a </v>
<v Speaker 4>very simple intention in everything you </v>

1810
01:27:30.890 --> 01:27:31.830
<v Speaker 4>do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is as much as possible.</v>

1811
01:27:31.830 --> 01:27:36.420
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to try to alleviate the </v>
<v Speaker 4>suffering of people around me as much as</v>

1812
01:27:36.421 --> 01:27:37.650
<v Speaker 4>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1813
01:27:37.651 --> 01:27:38.840
<v Speaker 4>not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That might not be a lot.</v>

1814
01:27:38.910 --> 01:27:42.880
<v Speaker 4>It might just be call.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It might just be those two.</v>

1815
01:27:42.930 --> 01:27:47.930
<v Speaker 4>We got back from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from this last UFC just a little bit of </v>

1816
01:27:47.930 --> 01:27:50.841
<v Speaker 4>mushrooms was enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw a homeless guy and he was looking </v>

1817
01:27:50.841 --> 01:27:50.841
<v Speaker 4>for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1818
01:27:50.841 --> 01:27:50.910
<v Speaker 4>I open my wallet and I only have </v>
<v Speaker 4>twenties,</v>

1819
01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:51.630
<v Speaker 4>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1820
01:27:52.180 --> 01:27:53.520
<v Speaker 4>fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There you go.</v>

1821
01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.130
<v Speaker 4>That's what it does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And those little moments,</v>

1822
01:27:56.131 --> 01:28:01.131
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it shows you that you get those moments </v>

1823
01:28:01.131 --> 01:28:01.230
<v Speaker 4>present themselves to you all day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking long,</v>

1824
01:28:01.470 --> 01:28:04.050
<v Speaker 4>but if you are stuck in selfishness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't see it.</v>

1825
01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:06.090
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's real simple little things,</v>

1826
01:28:06.420 --> 01:28:08.520
<v Speaker 4>but it's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a very wonderful.</v>

1827
01:28:08.700 --> 01:28:12.220
<v Speaker 4>That kind of simple intention can really</v>
<v Speaker 4>deep pollute your,</v>

1828
01:28:12.390 --> 01:28:16.770
<v Speaker 4>your subjective city that you've been </v>
<v Speaker 4>sucking in shitty gas.</v>

1829
01:28:16.770 --> 01:28:21.770

<v Speaker 4>only time I was looking for a guide to </v>

1830

<v Speaker 4>but it was Willie Hunter was on him and </v>

<v Speaker 4>He was shitting on some like comic who </v>

1832
01:28:27.921 --> 01:28:27.921
<v Speaker 4>would become like a vine star,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1833
01:28:27.921 --> 01:28:29.700
<v Speaker 4>she was a shitty comment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it became like a and he was like,</v>

1834
01:28:29.780 --> 01:28:30.530
<v Speaker 4>I hate falling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're like,</v>

1835
01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:32.760
<v Speaker 4>just for fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's six second videos.</v>

1836
01:28:32.761 --> 01:28:33.210
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1837
01:28:33.211 --> 01:28:34.110
<v Speaker 4>I hate him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1838
01:28:34.111 --> 01:28:35.780
<v Speaker 4>what about a six second youtube video?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Watch that.</v>

1839
01:28:35.900 --> 01:28:36.860
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

1840
01:28:36.870 --> 01:28:38.820
<v Speaker 4>He was just big,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shitty or like try to talk about it.</v>

1841
01:28:38.821 --> 01:28:40.740
<v Speaker 4>He wouldn't stop that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We started with the mushrooms.</v>

1842
01:28:40.750 --> 01:28:41.940
<v Speaker 4>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a bad person.</v>

1843
01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:44.520
<v Speaker 4>I never was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1844
01:28:44.521 --> 01:28:45.270
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're fine.</v>

1845
01:28:45.300 --> 01:28:46.740
<v Speaker 4>And he kept doing it and eventually I </v>
<v Speaker 4>was like,</v>

1846
01:28:46.850 --> 01:28:47.490
<v Speaker 4>really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Listen,</v>

1847
01:28:48.450 --> 01:28:49.830
<v Speaker 4>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was you.</v>

1848
01:28:49.831 --> 01:28:52.440
<v Speaker 4>Being a bad person was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm so sorry.</v>

1849
01:28:52.460 --> 01:28:57.460
<v Speaker 4>There was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's okay because here's the deal from </v>

1850
01:28:57.460 --> 01:28:57.460
<v Speaker 4>now on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't have to be that anymore.</v>

1851
01:28:57.460 --> 01:28:59.220
<v Speaker 4>You can just let that go and let people </v>
<v Speaker 4>talk,</v>

1852
01:28:59.221 --> 01:29:00.880
<v Speaker 4>and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1853
01:29:01.460 --> 01:29:06.460
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what it shows you like you can </v>

1854
01:29:06.460 --> 01:29:08.301
<v Speaker 4>change,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that thing you're talking about </v>

1855
01:29:08.301 --> 01:29:08.301
<v Speaker 4>where you realize,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shit,</v>

1856
01:29:08.301 --> 01:29:09.300
<v Speaker 4>I'm a bad person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is there is,</v>

1857
01:29:09.301 --> 01:29:10.530
<v Speaker 4>I can't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Name and Buddhism.</v>

1858
01:29:10.531 --> 01:29:15.531
<v Speaker 4>There's an actual name for that and it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>considered to be a very sweet moment </v>

1859
01:29:15.531 --> 01:29:19.310
<v Speaker 4>where you need that moment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's virtualizer where you need that </v>

1860
01:29:19.310 --> 01:29:23.001
<v Speaker 4>moment where you look at your life and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you feel this very specific kind of </v>

1861
01:29:23.131 --> 01:29:28.131
<v Speaker 4>sadness because you look at all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>times you could have been kinder all the</v>

1862
01:29:28.351 --> 01:29:33.351
<v Speaker 4>times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could have called that person back </v>

1863
01:29:33.351 --> 01:29:35.780
<v Speaker 4>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could have made decisions that were </v>

1864
01:29:35.780 --> 01:29:38.630
<v Speaker 4>pushing your boat in the direction of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>better world and you didn't do it and </v>

1865
01:29:38.630 --> 01:29:43.011
<v Speaker 4>you should feel sad about that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you shouldn't spend your whole life </v>

1866
01:29:43.011 --> 01:29:43.011
<v Speaker 4>feeling sad about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1867
01:29:43.011 --> 01:29:45.210
<v Speaker 4>You should just spend some time there </v>
<v Speaker 4>and look at it and think,</v>

1868
01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:47.400
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well that's gone.</v>

1869
01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:52.410
<v Speaker 4>The past has been devoured by time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's only this moment now and so from</v>

1870
01:29:52.411 --> 01:29:54.570
<v Speaker 4>this point forward,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as much as I can,</v>

1871
01:29:54.810 --> 01:29:59.810
<v Speaker 4>my decisions are going to be based on </v>
<v Speaker 4>reducing the suffering of my species and</v>

1872
01:30:00.750 --> 01:30:05.750
<v Speaker 4>that means your trash before doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>mean you have to let her keep going </v>

1873
01:30:05.750 --> 01:30:05.750
<v Speaker 4>forever.</v>

1874
01:30:05.750 --> 01:30:05.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1875
01:30:07.370 --> 01:30:08.180
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

1876
01:30:08.181 --> 01:30:13.181
<v Speaker 2>the path of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of trying to figure out like what's the </v>

1877
01:30:13.181 --> 01:30:16.400
<v Speaker 2>best way in life is obscured by law and </v>
<v Speaker 2>going amazing.</v>

1878
01:30:16.430 --> 01:30:21.430
<v Speaker 2>Like there's laws that they've created </v>
<v Speaker 2>that make the best tools to find out who</v>

1879
01:30:22.071 --> 01:30:25.670
<v Speaker 2>you really are illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like there's not a therapy in the</v>

1880
01:30:25.671 --> 01:30:29.390
<v Speaker 2>fucking world that will get a crazy </v>
<v Speaker 2>sociopathic ego,</v>

1881
01:30:29.391 --> 01:30:32.690
<v Speaker 2>maniacal person to really look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves like a bag of mushrooms.</v>

1882
01:30:32.691 --> 01:30:33.490
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing,</v>

1883
01:30:33.890 --> 01:30:36.320
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All those moments in film with like,</v>

1884
01:30:36.520 --> 01:30:39.020
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I realize now that's all bullshit.</v>

1885
01:30:39.640 --> 01:30:44.640
<v Speaker 2>Creating a mushroom trip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People that you know that are </v>

1886
01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:44.640
<v Speaker 2>untrustworthy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can't.</v>

1887
01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:45.170
<v Speaker 2>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1888
01:30:45.950 --> 01:30:48.230
<v Speaker 2>you can't trust their stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't trust.</v>

1889
01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:53.360
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are the people that we all agree </v>

1890
01:30:53.360 --> 01:30:56.830
<v Speaker 2>could have like the best experience on </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychedelics because it'll give them </v>

1891
01:30:56.830 --> 01:31:00.761
<v Speaker 2>like the best view of themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but those are the same type of people </v>

1892
01:31:00.761 --> 01:31:01.220
<v Speaker 2>that are going to argue against it.</v>

1893
01:31:01.220 --> 01:31:06.220
<v Speaker 2>Like if you ever talked to people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want mushrooms to be legal or </v>

1894
01:31:06.220 --> 01:31:06.220
<v Speaker 2>don't want like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1895
01:31:06.220 --> 01:31:07.630
<v Speaker 2>but fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think that should be.</v>

1896
01:31:07.870 --> 01:31:12.870
<v Speaker 2>You'll lose your fucking mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about people who have lost her </v>

1897
01:31:12.870 --> 01:31:12.870
<v Speaker 2>fucking model now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like what?</v>

1898
01:31:12.870 --> 01:31:14.180
<v Speaker 2>People have lost their mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you talking about?</v>

1899
01:31:14.270 --> 01:31:17.180
<v Speaker 2>Those 14?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's been some people that have blown</v>

1900
01:31:17.181 --> 01:31:20.420
<v Speaker 2>their brains out with LSD for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's definitely been some people that</v>

1901
01:31:20.421 --> 01:31:25.421
<v Speaker 2>had some psychotic episodes and it can </v>
<v Speaker 2>be argued that a lot of those are </v>

1902
01:31:25.421 --> 01:31:27.170
<v Speaker 2>psychotic episodes are people who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>control freaks,</v>

1903
01:31:27.171 --> 01:31:30.770
<v Speaker 2>are egomaniacs that are struggling with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the reality that's presented with them.</v>

1904
01:31:31.310 --> 01:31:33.500
<v Speaker 2>Present it to them that you shouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>try it.</v>

1905
01:31:33.501 --> 01:31:36.380
<v Speaker 2>That's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People with a history of schizophrenia,</v>

1906
01:31:36.410 --> 01:31:37.750
<v Speaker 2>the family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bipolar,</v>

1907
01:31:38.910 --> 01:31:40.620
<v Speaker 2>bipolar people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they probably shouldn't try it either.</v>

1908
01:31:40.621 --> 01:31:45.621
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's probably a whole slew of people </v>

1909
01:31:45.621 --> 01:31:45.650
<v Speaker 2>who have abnormal human chemistry.</v>

1910
01:31:45.690 --> 01:31:46.800
<v Speaker 4>You know what else?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bipolar,</v>

1911
01:31:46.801 --> 01:31:51.801
<v Speaker 4>people shouldn't try.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Caffeine really shouldn't take caffeine </v>

1912
01:31:51.801 --> 01:31:51.801
<v Speaker 4>pills.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1913
01:31:51.801 --> 01:31:53.250
<v Speaker 4>you shouldn't do anything that's going </v>
<v Speaker 4>to push you into a manic state.</v>

1914
01:31:53.490 --> 01:31:55.920
<v Speaker 4>It's like we can't consider,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1915
01:31:55.921 --> 01:31:56.580
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1916
01:31:56.780 --> 01:31:57.400
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1917
01:31:57.410 --> 01:32:00.490
<v Speaker 4>the victim thing about the victims of </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychedelics,</v>

1918
01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:03.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I know you think climbing up,</v>

1919
01:32:03.550 --> 01:32:04.600
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That math?</v>

1920
01:32:04.740 --> 01:32:06.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's ridiculous,</v>

1921
01:32:06.131 --> 01:32:09.880
<v Speaker 1>but there is a valley there called the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just read about this on Reddit,</v>

1922
01:32:09.881 --> 01:32:11.350
<v Speaker 1>I think it's called.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an area,</v>

1923
01:32:11.351 --> 01:32:16.351
<v Speaker 1>I think it's called the valley of </v>
<v Speaker 1>rainbows and they call it that because </v>

1924
01:32:16.351 --> 01:32:19.960
<v Speaker 1>of the brightly colored jackets on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>corpses that are all laying there dead.</v>

1925
01:32:20.190 --> 01:32:22.570
<v Speaker 1>And I think psychedelics have the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of valley.</v>

1926
01:32:22.750 --> 01:32:27.750
<v Speaker 1>I think that there is an undeniable </v>
<v Speaker 1>valley that must be filled with people </v>

1927
01:32:29.350 --> 01:32:34.350
<v Speaker 1>who have been pushed into psychotic </v>
<v Speaker 1>episodes or who are under the influence </v>

1928
01:32:34.421 --> 01:32:37.660
<v Speaker 1>of a psychedelic made bad decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>car accidents,</v>

1929
01:32:37.780 --> 01:32:40.990
<v Speaker 1>all the things that come from </v>
<v Speaker 1>irresponsibly using toxic.</v>

1930
01:32:41.100 --> 01:32:46.100
<v Speaker 1>You've got to admit that's real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just because that is real doesn't </v>

1931
01:32:46.100 --> 01:32:51.090
<v Speaker 1>therefore exclude all the people who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying again and again and again and </v>

1932
01:32:51.731 --> 01:32:52.180
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

1933
01:32:53.290 --> 01:32:56.500
<v Speaker 1>Relationships are better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the marriages,</v>

1934
01:32:56.540 --> 01:32:59.650
<v Speaker 1>he even with alcohol or if there's some </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump terms don't trump drawing,</v>

1935
01:33:00.040 --> 01:33:05.040
<v Speaker 1>but it's pretty fun to get fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 1>with your friends once in a while you </v>

1936
01:33:05.040 --> 01:33:06.100
<v Speaker 1>got to look at the whole picture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the whole thing.</v>

1937
01:33:06.130 --> 01:33:09.010
<v Speaker 1>Don't deny the fact that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous chemicals and that people have</v>

1938
01:33:09.011 --> 01:33:12.580
<v Speaker 1>more than likely completely lost their </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit because of them.</v>

1939
01:33:12.581 --> 01:33:17.581
<v Speaker 1>Don't deny that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then also don't deny the benefits </v>

1940
01:33:17.581 --> 01:33:21.331
<v Speaker 1>and the same way with American sniper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much better movie if that character was </v>

1941
01:33:21.551 --> 01:33:26.551
<v Speaker 1>actually dealing with the fact that he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>blowing people away in a war that has </v>

1942
01:33:26.551 --> 01:33:28.690
<v Speaker 1>been shown to be based on bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

1943
01:33:28.780 --> 01:33:32.170
<v Speaker 1>You think that when you get to be as old</v>
<v Speaker 1>as clinics with us,</v>

1944
01:33:32.590 --> 01:33:35.830
<v Speaker 1>don't you think to you or your faculties</v>
<v Speaker 1>have been compromised?</v>

1945
01:33:35.860 --> 01:33:36.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1946
01:33:36.151 --> 01:33:36.590
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1947
01:33:36.591 --> 01:33:38.280
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost 100 percent nothing thinking</v>

1948
01:33:38.290 --> 01:33:39.820
<v Speaker 1>the same way he was.</v>

1949
01:33:39.820 --> 01:33:40.940
<v Speaker 1>He's not as sharp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1950
01:33:40.980 --> 01:33:42.670
<v Speaker 1>Honest million dollar baby was really </v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

1951
01:33:43.030 --> 01:33:44.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is not that.</v>

1952
01:33:44.730 --> 01:33:49.730
<v Speaker 1>It's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the subject matter that he's prone </v>

1953
01:33:49.730 --> 01:33:51.520
<v Speaker 1>to go into these very right wing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>also you probably get over.</v>

1954
01:33:51.530 --> 01:33:56.530
<v Speaker 1>You can't separate your feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't have any feeling about women </v>

1955
01:33:56.530 --> 01:33:56.980
<v Speaker 1>boxers exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has deep feelings about this,</v>

1956
01:33:56.981 --> 01:33:58.890
<v Speaker 1>but it's got to be 100 percent raw Rah </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rah,</v>

1957
01:33:58.891 --> 01:33:59.770
<v Speaker 1>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right man,</v>

1958
01:33:59.771 --> 01:34:01.000
<v Speaker 1>now you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you were younger,</v>

1959
01:34:01.001 --> 01:34:02.070
<v Speaker 1>you're still wouldn't be able to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1960
01:34:02.170 --> 01:34:07.170
<v Speaker 1>It's like when someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when someone talks like in their own </v>

1961
01:34:07.170 --> 01:34:07.510
<v Speaker 1>words and you get to hear them talk in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own words,</v>

1962
01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:09.850
<v Speaker 1>you get a sense of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1963
01:34:09.851 --> 01:34:14.350
<v Speaker 1>I see why you created this piece of art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see why this is your perspective.</v>

1964
01:34:14.530 --> 01:34:17.500
<v Speaker 1>And when you saw that the Republican </v>
<v Speaker 1>national convention thing,</v>

1965
01:34:17.501 --> 01:34:19.720
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck it was when he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking to Obama,</v>

1966
01:34:19.960 --> 01:34:21.310
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's Clint Eastwood.</v>

1967
01:34:21.460 --> 01:34:22.460
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1968
01:34:22.540 --> 01:34:25.750
<v Speaker 1>he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's so fucking crazy that he thought</v>

1969
01:34:25.751 --> 01:34:27.820
<v Speaker 1>that up like on the spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was ad libbed,</v>

1970
01:34:28.210 --> 01:34:29.800
<v Speaker 1>but you didn't even have anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>planned out.</v>

1971
01:34:29.960 --> 01:34:34.960
<v Speaker 1>This fucking guy is giving this speech </v>
<v Speaker 1>in front of this gigantic group of </v>

1972
01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:36.250
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's so confident in his ideas.</v>

1973
01:34:36.460 --> 01:34:41.260
<v Speaker 1>Then he's going to ad Lib a conversation</v>
<v Speaker 1>with Obama complete with punchlines.</v>

1974
01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:44.290
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He comes from a non video world to where</v>

1975
01:34:44.291 --> 01:34:44.900
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1976
01:34:44.980 --> 01:34:49.980
<v Speaker 1>So it was a group of a thousand people </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely confident in his position in </v>

1977
01:34:50.771 --> 01:34:55.771
<v Speaker 1>life and who he is and he's a movie star</v>
<v Speaker 1>has been a movie star for fucking </v>

1978
01:34:55.771 --> 01:34:55.771
<v Speaker 1>100,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

1979
01:34:56.230 --> 01:34:59.540
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's been kissing his ass long </v>
<v Speaker 1>before the Internet came along.</v>

1980
01:35:00.020 --> 01:35:02.330
<v Speaker 1>He's also a guy that agreed to do a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking reality show.</v>

1981
01:35:02.331 --> 01:35:05.180
<v Speaker 1>Do you know that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where his wife was in a reality show.</v>

1982
01:35:05.210 --> 01:35:07.510
<v Speaker 1>His wife was in some crazy reality show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1983
01:35:07.530 --> 01:35:09.200
<v Speaker 1>his wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they're still together.</v>

1984
01:35:09.201 --> 01:35:12.200
<v Speaker 1>I think they might've got divorced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he wanted to be a star,</v>

1985
01:35:12.201 --> 01:35:16.490
<v Speaker 1>so she married when she was young and </v>
<v Speaker 1>hot and then she did a reality show.</v>

1986
01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:18.350
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know it.</v>

1987
01:35:18.860 --> 01:35:19.880
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it didn't last.</v>

1988
01:35:20.070 --> 01:35:22.520
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure if he's still with her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Has No real,</v>

1989
01:35:22.640 --> 01:35:25.100
<v Speaker 4>real cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I will look at worth it.</v>

1990
01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:30.160
<v Speaker 4>I looked up an interview with Eastwood </v>
<v Speaker 4>about directing the movie because I </v>

1991
01:35:30.160 --> 01:35:31.640
<v Speaker 4>didn't understand how the guy at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Republican National Committee by this.</v>

1992
01:35:32.150 --> 01:35:32.460
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1993
01:35:32.480 --> 01:35:33.800
<v Speaker 4>I mean I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh wow,</v>

1994
01:35:33.801 --> 01:35:38.801
<v Speaker 4>this is such blatant propaganda.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not even trying to make it </v>

1995
01:35:38.801 --> 01:35:38.801
<v Speaker 4>subtle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is just like war,</v>

1996
01:35:38.801 --> 01:35:40.100
<v Speaker 4>war,</v>
<v Speaker 4>time movie out of it.</v>

1997
01:35:40.160 --> 01:35:41.150
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1998
01:35:41.210 --> 01:35:42.680
<v Speaker 4>That I was curious like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1999
01:35:42.681 --> 01:35:47.681
<v Speaker 4>I wonder how involved eastwood was in </v>
<v Speaker 4>directing this just based on what I saw </v>

2000
01:35:47.681 --> 01:35:49.400
<v Speaker 4>at the Republican national convention.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Didn't know it was improvised.</v>

2001
01:35:49.401 --> 01:35:54.401
<v Speaker 4>So now that kind of explains it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought maybe he was just suffering </v>

2002
01:35:54.401 --> 01:35:54.710
<v Speaker 4>from senile dementia or something</v>

2003
01:35:54.910 --> 01:35:58.450
<v Speaker 1>called Mrs Eastwood and company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was on 2012.</v>

2004
01:35:58.451 --> 01:36:00.970
<v Speaker 1>It was a reality show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what the interview say though?</v>

2005
01:36:01.250 --> 01:36:02.390
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the interview was,</v>

2006
01:36:02.540 --> 01:36:04.160
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was just him saying like,</v>

2007
01:36:04.161 --> 01:36:07.610
<v Speaker 4>he had actually been reading the book </v>
<v Speaker 4>when they called and he said,</v>

2008
01:36:08.090 --> 01:36:13.090
<v Speaker 4>let me finish the book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've got 40 pages left and so I read it </v>

2009
01:36:13.090 --> 01:36:14.320
<v Speaker 4>the next day and decided,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2010
01:36:14.330 --> 01:36:17.690
<v Speaker 4>I was just a basic basic interview,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I just,</v>

2011
01:36:17.990 --> 01:36:20.230
<v Speaker 4>it was just so appalled by that.</v>

2012
01:36:20.560 --> 01:36:22.730
<v Speaker 1>That was her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty God damn hot that his wife,</v>

2013
01:36:22.790 --> 01:36:27.790
<v Speaker 1>it was his wife divorced him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course he would marry a super hot </v>

2014
01:36:27.790 --> 01:36:27.790
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's hot as fuck.</v>

2015
01:36:27.790 --> 01:36:31.930
<v Speaker 1>Should compounds a wowza son.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2016
01:36:32.560 --> 01:36:37.220

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2017

<v Speaker 1>You can't really say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You also have some that.</v>

2018
01:36:40.070 --> 01:36:45.070
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also have a story that's out on </v>

2019
01:36:45.070 --> 01:36:45.070

<v Speaker 1>What are you doing?</v>

2023
01:36:49.190 --> 01:36:52.680
<v Speaker 1>The beginning of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should say,</v>

2024
01:36:52.681 --> 01:36:55.830
<v Speaker 1>this is all a lie you just got done </v>

<v Speaker 1>admitting to an Interpol related crime.</v>

2028

<v Speaker 3>That's such a slow ball too and I just </v>

2050
01:38:02.360 --> 01:38:04.761
<v Speaker 3>thought he was going to give you acid to</v>
<v Speaker 3>this kid and he wasn't going to.</v>

2051
01:38:05.641 --> 01:38:08.340
<v Speaker 3>But then the kid picked up a Bible so he</v>
<v Speaker 3>gave the kid acid.</v>

2052
01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:13.640
<v Speaker 3>Now this the real movies of this sniper </v>
<v Speaker 3>moment,</v>

2053
01:38:16.020 --> 01:38:18.060
<v Speaker 3>the kid is about to pick up the Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't do it.</v>

2054
01:38:18.270 --> 01:38:23.270
<v Speaker 3>Gets the eyedropper and squirts in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>kid's mouth and you see the kids </v>

2055
01:38:23.270 --> 01:38:26.211
<v Speaker 3>eyeballs dilate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>falls back into a kaleidoscope and </v>

2056
01:38:26.211 --> 01:38:30.760
<v Speaker 3>Sufjan Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We hope you do to do something.</v>

2057
01:38:36.031 --> 01:38:38.360
<v Speaker 3>Probably worse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of the more ridiculous than that.</v>

2058
01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:40.510
<v Speaker 3>What smart people will see through this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2059
01:38:40.530 --> 01:38:42.000
<v Speaker 3>That's not as watching this though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2060
01:38:42.001 --> 01:38:44.280
<v Speaker 3>Those sniper movies aren't really for </v>
<v Speaker 3>smart people,</v>

2061
01:38:44.310 --> 01:38:49.310
<v Speaker 3>but it's cool to watch clinches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Timothy leary at the Senate hearings </v>

2062
01:38:49.310 --> 01:38:49.310
<v Speaker 3>apologized to my data.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cool.</v>

2063
01:38:49.310 --> 01:38:52.290
<v Speaker 3>Watching him like having to talk to </v>
<v Speaker 3>Senate about lsd.</v>

2064
01:38:52.291 --> 01:38:53.750
<v Speaker 3>It's bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he just,</v>

2065
01:38:53.820 --> 01:38:56.820
<v Speaker 3>you apologize to your date while we were</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking.</v>

2066
01:38:56.821 --> 01:38:57.410
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah.</v>

2067
01:38:57.460 --> 01:39:00.090
<v Speaker 3>So I thought that'd be better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>

2068
01:39:00.680 --> 01:39:02.020
<v Speaker 1>Just a poor pick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2069
01:39:02.021 --> 01:39:03.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get to pick the next one.</v>

2070
01:39:03.870 --> 01:39:06.920
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

2071
01:39:07.570 --> 01:39:12.570
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of stories about this and </v>

2072
01:39:12.570 --> 01:39:12.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting a shitload of tweets of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people asking me,</v>

2073
01:39:12.570 --> 01:39:15.320
<v Speaker 1>like to substantiate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's a lot of stories.</v>

2074
01:39:15.321 --> 01:39:17.920
<v Speaker 1>It's all over online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are the Himalayan?</v>

2075
01:39:18.500 --> 01:39:19.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the weld.</v>

2076
01:39:19.370 --> 01:39:24.370
<v Speaker 1>The concerns are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't say I don't know who the fuck </v>

2077
01:39:24.370 --> 01:39:24.370
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2078
01:39:24.370 --> 01:39:24.370
<v Speaker 1>And who's wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't do any research.</v>

2079
01:39:24.370 --> 01:39:28.240
<v Speaker 1>Clipped a jury to the jury,</v>
<v Speaker 1>decided that Ventura was right,</v>

2080
01:39:28.750 --> 01:39:30.740
<v Speaker 1>and then nothing else has been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They owe him.</v>

2081
01:39:30.880 --> 01:39:31.340
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2082
01:39:31.341 --> 01:39:34.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm Jesse Ventura.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One point $8 million dollars.</v>

2083
01:39:34.071 --> 01:39:37.190
<v Speaker 1>Apparently one point eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one point 9 million.</v>

2084
01:39:37.710 --> 01:39:40.600
<v Speaker 1>Say one point seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one point seven feet with the fight.</v>

2085
01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:45.410
<v Speaker 1>So it's also crazy that that's how it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>never like one point eight,</v>

2086
01:39:45.411 --> 01:39:45.890
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

2087
01:39:45.891 --> 01:39:46.880
<v Speaker 1>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>4 million.</v>

2088
01:39:47.180 --> 01:39:49.070
<v Speaker 1>Like it's not exact amount is the pain.</v>

2089
01:39:49.100 --> 01:39:54.100
<v Speaker 1>How do they come up with it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That narrowed it down to the close </v>

2090
01:39:54.100 --> 01:39:54.100
<v Speaker 1>800,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so weird.</v>

2091
01:39:54.100 --> 01:39:55.550
<v Speaker 1>Thousand to weird thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2092
01:39:55.551 --> 01:40:00.551
<v Speaker 1>to make a movie about a guy who might </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been a liar and put those lines in </v>

2093
01:40:01.581 --> 01:40:03.230
<v Speaker 1>a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that gets all miracle.</v>

2094
01:40:03.240 --> 01:40:05.490
<v Speaker 1>All frothy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2095
01:40:05.840 --> 01:40:06.980
<v Speaker 1>well that means that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what that means?</v>

2096
01:40:06.981 --> 01:40:08.780
<v Speaker 1>That means another fucking attacks </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming.</v>

2097
01:40:09.410 --> 01:40:14.410
<v Speaker 1>Does that what it means?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we had to get salt orchestrated </v>

2098
01:40:14.410 --> 01:40:14.410
<v Speaker 1>because we've got to get people ready to</v>
<v Speaker 1>join up.</v>

2099
01:40:14.410 --> 01:40:18.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's better than a draft.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess if you got to pick between that </v>

2100
01:40:18.850 --> 01:40:20.720
<v Speaker 1>draft and a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2101
01:40:22.190 --> 01:40:25.370
<v Speaker 1>that means for like ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 1>propaganda movies coming out every year.</v>

2102
01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:28.600
<v Speaker 1>You know what I think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you shouldn't have no wars.</v>

2103
01:40:29.030 --> 01:40:31.280
<v Speaker 1>We should fight no wars with anyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>under 50.</v>

2104
01:40:32.030 --> 01:40:35.150
<v Speaker 1>I think everybody who goes to war should</v>
<v Speaker 1>be over 50 lps.</v>

2105
01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:40.440
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see how quick we fucking settle </v>

2106
01:40:40.440 --> 01:40:40.440
<v Speaker 1>this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet it would be pretty God damn quick.</v>

2107
01:40:40.440 --> 01:40:44.380
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of old people that just don't </v>

2108
01:40:44.380 --> 01:40:44.380
<v Speaker 1>want any trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was like,</v>

2109
01:40:44.380 --> 01:40:48.190
<v Speaker 1>how can we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there a way to solve this without </v>

2110
01:40:48.190 --> 01:40:48.190
<v Speaker 1>shooting them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like those feet on the ground.</v>

2111
01:40:48.190 --> 01:40:48.190
<v Speaker 1>He was coming at me and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2112
01:40:48.190 --> 01:40:53.051
<v Speaker 1>but shooting him to death is the only </v>
<v Speaker 1>way to stop a guy because you think </v>

2113
01:40:53.051 --> 01:40:54.070
<v Speaker 1>about the consequences of the decisions </v>
<v Speaker 1>or think</v>

2114
01:40:54.070 --> 01:40:59.070
<v Speaker 2>about the consequences of a decision to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fly in a plane to a place where you've </v>

2115
01:40:59.070 --> 01:41:02.281
<v Speaker 2>never been and shoot someone he never </v>
<v Speaker 2>known based on the directions by some </v>

2116
01:41:02.281 --> 01:41:04.870
<v Speaker 2>people who you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're making you march.</v>

2117
01:41:05.110 --> 01:41:06.260

<v Speaker 2>shoo.</v>

2121
01:41:13.240 --> 01:41:18.240

<v Speaker 2>Imagine that with 50 year old.</v>

2122
01:41:19.270 --> 01:41:21.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2123
01:41:22.130 --> 01:41:23.420
<v Speaker 2>We're going to go wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wait and why?</v>

2124
01:41:23.421 --> 01:41:24.540
<v Speaker 2>We're shooting these guys winning and </v>
<v Speaker 2>winning.</v>

2125
01:41:24.550 --> 01:41:25.540
<v Speaker 2>We're breaking down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What door?</v>

<v Speaker 2>What's the difference between the Sunni </v>

2130
01:41:36.301 --> 01:41:36.301
<v Speaker 2>and Shia?</v>

<v Speaker 2>with each other?</v>

2133
01:41:37.901 --> 01:41:39.850
<v Speaker 2>Do you know why they hate each other?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know how to hate us?</v>

01:41:39.940 --> 01:41:42.580
<v Speaker 2>Do you know this is Holy Land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know how long this has been?</v>

2135
01:41:42.581 --> 01:41:44.360
<v Speaker 2>Holy Land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know when they're in?</v>

2136
01:41:44.660 --> 01:41:47.830
<v Speaker 2>If you had a group of 50 year old people</v>
<v Speaker 2>there and slug it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>that you say are bad.</v>

2143
01:42:05.350 --> 01:42:10.350
<v Speaker 2>If we did that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we just had only 50 year olds and </v>

2144
01:42:10.350 --> 01:42:11.020
<v Speaker 2>above go to war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole fucking thing would change.</v>

2145
01:42:11.440 --> 01:42:16.440
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just it's easy to send fucking </v>

2146
01:42:16.440 --> 01:42:16.440
<v Speaker 2>kids.</v>

2147
01:42:16.440 --> 01:42:17.770
<v Speaker 2>They don't know any better detail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your cerebral cortex,</v>

2148
01:42:17.771 --> 01:42:20.560
<v Speaker 2>your frontal lobe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're saying like for young males,</v>

2149
01:42:20.561 --> 01:42:25.561
<v Speaker 2>especially because fucking influx,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rowdy or not making rational </v>

2150
01:42:26.291 --> 01:42:28.240
<v Speaker 2>decisions like when you're a 16 year old</v>
<v Speaker 2>kid,</v>

2151
01:42:28.360 --> 01:42:31.210
<v Speaker 2>your balls are filled with testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a completely new experience.</v>

2152
01:42:31.360 --> 01:42:33.100
<v Speaker 2>By the time you've got to be 40 years </v>
<v Speaker 2>old,</v>

2153
01:42:33.250 --> 01:42:35.440
<v Speaker 2>you've had a lifetime of wanting to </v>
<v Speaker 2>come.</v>

2154
01:42:35.590 --> 01:42:39.280
<v Speaker 2>A lifetime of like knowing what that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>and knowing how to mitigate it.</v>

2155
01:42:39.450 --> 01:42:41.620
<v Speaker 2>When you're 17,</v>
<v Speaker 2>18,</v>

2156
01:42:41.800 --> 01:42:44.500
<v Speaker 2>you don't know what the fuck is </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening to your body.</v>

2157
01:42:44.650 --> 01:42:49.650
<v Speaker 2>You add into that masturbation guilt </v>
<v Speaker 2>like people who were actually avoiding </v>

2158
01:42:49.650 --> 01:42:51.340
<v Speaker 2>masturbation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of us don't,</v>

2159
01:42:51.550 --> 01:42:56.120
<v Speaker 2>but there are some who so they try it as</v>
<v Speaker 2>little as top of the white gloves on the</v>

2160
01:42:56.510 --> 01:43:01.510
<v Speaker 2>guns when they get comments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they put Megan where a white glove </v>

2161

<v Speaker 1>legend even though he's now.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I just fucking up his shot looking at </v>

2201
01:45:10.810 --> 01:45:15.620
<v Speaker 1>extra pressure on this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a facebook page not endorsing </v>

2202
01:45:15.620 --> 01:45:16.410
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just letting you know this dedicated</v>

2203
01:45:16.411 --> 01:45:20.540
<v Speaker 1>entirely to the subject and it's Chris.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kyle was a murderous liar.</v>

2204
01:45:20.740 --> 01:45:25.740
<v Speaker 1>It's a community on facebook and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>all a bunch of different posts saying </v>

2205
01:45:26.311 --> 01:45:27.160
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2206
01:45:27.360 --> 01:45:30.150
<v Speaker 1>saying how much it was bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is crazy,</v>

2207
01:45:30.151 --> 01:45:30.480
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2208
01:45:32.720 --> 01:45:34.340
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess people don't want to.</v>

2209
01:45:34.760 --> 01:45:39.090
<v Speaker 4>It's really hard for people to digest </v>
<v Speaker 4>the simple fact that Pete,</v>

2210
01:45:39.230 --> 01:45:42.630
<v Speaker 4>that war makes a lot of money for a </v>
<v Speaker 4>small amount of people.</v>

2211
01:45:42.631 --> 01:45:45.270
<v Speaker 4>It's a profitable endeavor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

2212
01:45:45.740 --> 01:45:48.590
<v Speaker 4>if you want to make money in that </v>
<v Speaker 4>industry,</v>

2213
01:45:48.591 --> 01:45:53.220
<v Speaker 4>then you've got to convince heroes </v>
<v Speaker 4>because that is the heroic ends.</v>

2214
01:45:53.270 --> 01:45:58.270
<v Speaker 4>It's a really sweet mpulse the idea that</v>
<v Speaker 4>I will give my life for you to protect </v>

2215
01:45:59.151 --> 01:46:00.550
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to protect people.</v>

2216
01:46:00.560 --> 01:46:05.560
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the one of the highest human </v>

2217
01:46:05.560 --> 01:46:05.560
<v Speaker 4>aspirations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like an incredible thing,</v>

2218
01:46:05.690 --> 01:46:10.690
<v Speaker 4>but so you take those people who have </v>
<v Speaker 4>this incredible aspiration to give their</v>

2219
01:46:11.001 --> 01:46:16.001
<v Speaker 4>life to protect people and you lie to </v>
<v Speaker 4>them and brainwash them and send them to</v>

2220
01:46:16.851 --> 01:46:21.851
<v Speaker 4>a place to kill people based on this </v>
<v Speaker 4>very incredible thing and leave the nfl </v>

2221
01:46:22.640 --> 01:46:24.500
<v Speaker 4>and fucking give us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And by the way,</v>

2222
01:46:24.530 --> 01:46:26.540
<v Speaker 4>well no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pat Tillman did it on his own.</v>

2223
01:46:28.220 --> 01:46:33.220
<v Speaker 4>We need you to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But Pat Tillman was a huge critic once </v>

2224
01:46:33.220 --> 01:46:33.220
<v Speaker 4>he got over there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2225
01:46:33.220 --> 01:46:38.071
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was killed by friendly fire and </v>

2226
01:46:38.071 --> 01:46:38.071
<v Speaker 4>there's many people that have speculated</v>
<v Speaker 4>they murdered him,</v>

2227
01:46:38.071 --> 01:46:38.840
<v Speaker 4>that murdered him because he wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>shut the fuck up.</v>

2228
01:46:39.490 --> 01:46:42.320
<v Speaker 4>Organize.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything was about what a dog and pony</v>

2229
01:46:42.321 --> 01:46:44.510
<v Speaker 4>show and everything was fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The people that are to listen to,</v>

2230
01:46:44.520 --> 01:46:46.070
<v Speaker 4>we're all assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who was like,</v>

2231
01:46:46.071 --> 01:46:48.650
<v Speaker 4>this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like this is not what I signed up for.</v>

2232
01:46:48.651 --> 01:46:50.070
<v Speaker 4>This is not what I wanted to</v>

2233
01:46:50.110 --> 01:46:55.110
<v Speaker 2>be in total chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which led to this fucking crossfire </v>

2234
01:46:55.110 --> 01:46:58.281
<v Speaker 2>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It killed fucking talent to stop </v>

2235
01:46:58.281 --> 01:46:58.940
<v Speaker 2>shooting and then they shot him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They shot his whole troop up.</v>

2236
01:46:58.950 --> 01:46:59.880
<v Speaker 2>Though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2237
01:46:59.910 --> 01:47:02.040
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you start shooting things,</v>

2238
01:47:02.041 --> 01:47:07.041
<v Speaker 2>that's the other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'd become target and then say we've </v>

2239
01:47:07.041 --> 01:47:07.200
<v Speaker 2>become targets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't comment on drone mistakes.</v>

2240
01:47:07.290 --> 01:47:08.750
<v Speaker 2>They don't comment on the times when </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

2241
01:47:08.751 --> 01:47:10.770
<v Speaker 2>It blows up a fucking wedding </v>
<v Speaker 2>convention,</v>

2242
01:47:10.771 --> 01:47:13.530
<v Speaker 2>which is most of the time that's why </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's more mistake,</v>

2243
01:47:13.531 --> 01:47:15.780
<v Speaker 2>the innocence and that our policy is not</v>
<v Speaker 2>the comment on that.</v>

2244
01:47:15.781 --> 01:47:16.380
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

2245
01:47:16.381 --> 01:47:18.090
<v Speaker 2>why is that an allowable policy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2246
01:47:18.091 --> 01:47:23.091
<v Speaker 2>the percentage is terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look at the percentage of people </v>

2247
01:47:23.091 --> 01:47:24.420
<v Speaker 2>that are actually killed by drones that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are their intended targets,</v>

2248
01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:26.130
<v Speaker 2>it's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It shouldn't be terrorists,</v>

2249
01:47:26.160 --> 01:47:29.310
<v Speaker 2>but they're not surgical strikes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How close is it?</v>

2250
01:47:29.340 --> 01:47:34.340
<v Speaker 2>You're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a scalpel on the end of a </v>

2251
01:47:34.340 --> 01:47:34.340
<v Speaker 2>fishing pole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2252
01:47:34.340 --> 01:47:36.330
<v Speaker 2>It's just the idea that surgical is </v>
<v Speaker 2>retarded.</v>

2253
01:47:36.360 --> 01:47:41.360
<v Speaker 2>If we had drones going overhead and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found out who's responsible for it </v>

2254
01:47:41.360 --> 01:47:41.360
<v Speaker 2>yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm a little kid,</v>

2255
01:47:41.370 --> 01:47:46.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is fucking Yemen drone that's over </v>

2256
01:47:46.370 --> 01:47:46.370
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Killed my kids.</v>

2257
01:47:46.370 --> 01:47:46.370
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Goddamn right,</v>

2258
01:47:46.370 --> 01:47:48.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to want attack Yemen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stop fucking set of that shit over here.</v>

2259
01:47:49.220 --> 01:47:50.620
<v Speaker 2>It killed my father.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2260
01:47:50.670 --> 01:47:51.660
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only that,</v>

2261
01:47:51.661 --> 01:47:54.960
<v Speaker 2>but why wouldn't they want to know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look at the,</v>

2262
01:47:54.990 --> 01:47:58.110
<v Speaker 2>like we were talking earlier about what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you were saying about this,</v>

2263
01:47:58.220 --> 01:48:03.220
<v Speaker 2>these invading armies in Iraq and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other people that have ptsd and the </v>

2264
01:48:03.220 --> 01:48:07.761
<v Speaker 2>birth defects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to go way back to the </v>

2265
01:48:07.761 --> 01:48:08.640
<v Speaker 2>original Gulf War.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were using fucking depleted uranium</v>

2266
01:48:08.641 --> 01:48:13.641
<v Speaker 2>and everybody forgets about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody completely sweep this under </v>

2267
01:48:13.641 --> 01:48:13.641
<v Speaker 2>the rug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was proven.</v>

2268
01:48:13.740 --> 01:48:17.550
<v Speaker 2>They use depleted uranium shells that </v>
<v Speaker 2>blew right through fucking tanks.</v>

2269
01:48:17.700 --> 01:48:22.700
<v Speaker 2>This incredibly dense nuclear waste that</v>
<v Speaker 2>poisons everything around it for 100,000</v>

2270
01:48:23.551 --> 01:48:28.551
<v Speaker 2>years and that was 25 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're expecting those 15 year olds who </v>

2271
01:48:28.551 --> 01:48:29.570
<v Speaker 2>were the 40 year olds now to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh well I don't care anymore.</v>

2272
01:48:29.580 --> 01:48:32.790
<v Speaker 2>No big deal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not just forget about that time.</v>

2273
01:48:32.791 --> 01:48:34.520
<v Speaker 2>You killed my entire family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2274
01:48:34.530 --> 01:48:39.530
<v Speaker 2>and you're right here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone representing your governments </v>

2275
01:48:39.530 --> 01:48:39.530
<v Speaker 2>right here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Totally cool,</v>

2276
01:48:39.530 --> 01:48:40.230
<v Speaker 2>but it's something that we're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to talk about.</v>

2277
01:48:40.231 --> 01:48:43.230
<v Speaker 2>Just like the ideologies that we just </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussed earlier,</v>

2278
01:48:43.231 --> 01:48:45.500
<v Speaker 2>just like religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it falls into a religion.</v>

2279
01:48:45.530 --> 01:48:47.700
<v Speaker 2>Got To talk about Elysium falls into a </v>
<v Speaker 2>religion.</v>

2280
01:48:47.701 --> 01:48:51.810
<v Speaker 2>Don't all start talking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can't talk about it.</v>

2281
01:48:51.930 --> 01:48:56.930
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also because there are bad people </v>

2282
01:48:56.930 --> 01:48:59.091
<v Speaker 2>keep talking about the weed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like that's why it's all lead </v>

2283
01:48:59.091 --> 01:48:59.091
<v Speaker 2>because I've got another deal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2284
01:48:59.091 --> 01:49:01.770
<v Speaker 2>Everyone talks about becomes normalized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to just talk about it all time.</v>

2285
01:49:01.800 --> 01:49:06.800
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're friends with whatever and it </v>

2286
01:49:06.800 --> 01:49:06.800
<v Speaker 2>doesn't mean that you're done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is where people get confused.</v>

2287
01:49:06.800 --> 01:49:11.681
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean that there aren't heroes</v>
<v Speaker 2>and doesn't mean you don't need a </v>

2288
01:49:11.681 --> 01:49:14.181
<v Speaker 2>defense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't need to be able to protect </v>

2289
01:49:14.181 --> 01:49:14.181
<v Speaker 2>yourself from some fucking North Korean </v>
<v Speaker 2>asshole.</v>

2290
01:49:14.181 --> 01:49:16.320
<v Speaker 2>That guy decides to start taking over </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

2291
01:49:16.321 --> 01:49:21.321
<v Speaker 2>Like what if they had massive resources.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're lucky they're in a resource </v>

2292
01:49:21.321 --> 01:49:23.160
<v Speaker 2>starved environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you have this communist dictator with</v>

2293
01:49:23.161 --> 01:49:28.161
<v Speaker 2>nuclear weapons that a resource starved </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment where they have to shut the </v>

2294
01:49:28.161 --> 01:49:28.560
<v Speaker 2>lights off at night because they can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>afford to keep them on,</v>

2295
01:49:28.800 --> 01:49:33.800
<v Speaker 2>but if that guy had oil or gold or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something crazy and like Saudi Arabia </v>

2296
01:49:33.961 --> 01:49:38.961
<v Speaker 2>type money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if like one of those guys became some </v>

2297
01:49:38.961 --> 01:49:39.390
<v Speaker 2>sort of a fucking world spreading </v>
<v Speaker 2>villain,</v>

2298
01:49:39.540 --> 01:49:44.540
<v Speaker 2>you need heroes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need real soldiers that are willing </v>

2299
01:49:44.540 --> 01:49:46.750
<v Speaker 2>to fight against bad people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what happened in World War Two,</v>

2300
01:49:47.500 --> 01:49:49.370
<v Speaker 2>World War II when you had the Nazis and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all that.</v>

2301
01:49:49.370 --> 01:49:51.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there's all sorts of flexes.</v>

2302
01:49:51.510 --> 01:49:53.350
<v Speaker 2>They use the justified war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2303
01:49:53.360 --> 01:49:57.790
<v Speaker 2>argument as proof to get us into sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>less way less justified war.</v>

2304
01:49:58.710 --> 01:50:02.200
<v Speaker 2>We're sending them to the best thing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen to the US army.</v>

2305
01:50:02.330 --> 01:50:03.430
<v Speaker 2>When we're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2306
01:50:03.490 --> 01:50:06.160
<v Speaker 2>now we can do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just say we're doing the right thing.</v>

2307
01:50:06.310 --> 01:50:11.310
<v Speaker 2>Exactly what is exactly the same thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>we were saying about religion is that </v>

2308
01:50:11.310 --> 01:50:14.590
<v Speaker 2>it's not that these people are bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>people and it's not that God is bad.</v>

2309
01:50:14.740 --> 01:50:17.380
<v Speaker 2>No one's saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what we're saying is like,</v>

2310
01:50:17.381 --> 01:50:21.640
<v Speaker 2>look what's being done in the name of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this and look how there's no thinking.</v>

2311
01:50:22.060 --> 01:50:24.670
<v Speaker 2>Whenever there's no thinking and </v>
<v Speaker 2>horrific acts are being done,</v>

2312
01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:30.000
<v Speaker 2>there's no thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're ever in a situation where a </v>

2313
01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:30.000
<v Speaker 2>fucking little kid has a rocket </v>
<v Speaker 2>launcher,</v>

2314
01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:31.150
<v Speaker 2>everybody should stop what they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

2315
01:50:31.330 --> 01:50:34.800
<v Speaker 2>Get the fuck out of there and try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out a how.</v>

2316
01:50:35.210 --> 01:50:37.240
<v Speaker 2>How did this happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or B,</v>

2317
01:50:37.330 --> 01:50:39.370
<v Speaker 2>how do you fix it and the way you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>fix this,</v>

2318
01:50:39.371 --> 01:50:44.371
<v Speaker 2>but shooting kids that doesn't fix shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>that just like the mother is doing now.</v>

2319
01:50:45.520 --> 01:50:50.520
<v Speaker 2>Oakland PD is starting up like Youth </v>
<v Speaker 2>Basketball Leagues and they're coaching </v>

2320
01:50:50.520 --> 01:50:51.820
<v Speaker 2>and stuff to so the youth grow up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not going fuck the police,</v>

2321
01:50:51.821 --> 01:50:52.190
<v Speaker 2>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2322
01:50:52.210 --> 01:50:53.650
<v Speaker 2>the police were cool there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Help sell it and stuff.</v>

2323
01:50:53.710 --> 01:50:55.510
<v Speaker 2>That's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't solve it right now,</v>

2324
01:50:55.511 --> 01:50:58.150
<v Speaker 2>but 20 years from now it'll be better </v>
<v Speaker 2>than it is now.</v>

2325
01:50:58.210 --> 01:51:03.210
<v Speaker 2>Will also.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's happened in New York when they </v>

2326
01:51:03.210 --> 01:51:04.420
<v Speaker 2>did the police slow down where they just</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't arrest anybody for anything.</v>

2327
01:51:04.421 --> 01:51:05.560
<v Speaker 2>After those two kids got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2328
01:51:05.561 --> 01:51:08.200
<v Speaker 2>there's two cops got shocked by that one</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy,</v>

2329
01:51:08.920 --> 01:51:12.070
<v Speaker 2>that one guy who by the way also shot </v>
<v Speaker 2>his fucking ex girlfriend,</v>

2330
01:51:12.071 --> 01:51:16.150
<v Speaker 2>like the guy was a piece of shit to </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to think he's a hero.</v>

2331
01:51:16.510 --> 01:51:19.570
<v Speaker 2>Like Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He shot his girlfriend first and then he</v>

2332
01:51:19.571 --> 01:51:22.780
<v Speaker 2>went and shot those cops.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a psychotic murderous person,</v>

2333
01:51:23.050 --> 01:51:27.640
<v Speaker 2>but because of that act,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cops backed up.</v>

2334
01:51:27.700 --> 01:51:31.120
<v Speaker 2>The cups finally started.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stopped fucking with people they need to</v>

2335
01:51:31.121 --> 01:51:33.130
<v Speaker 2>stay where they're at right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2336
01:51:33.131 --> 01:51:33.660
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

2337
01:51:33.661 --> 01:51:35.780
<v Speaker 2>Where they are right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cameras.</v>

2338
01:51:35.870 --> 01:51:40.870
<v Speaker 2>Are you finding this camera's not saying</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they should be scared all the time </v>

2339
01:51:40.870 --> 01:51:43.711
<v Speaker 2>of being murdered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm saying the attitude that they </v>

2340
01:51:43.711 --> 01:51:43.711
<v Speaker 2>devote like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2341
01:51:43.711 --> 01:51:43.711
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to arrest anybody for </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

2342
01:51:43.711 --> 01:51:48.211
<v Speaker 2>That's not important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all you should have ever been </v>

2343
01:51:48.211 --> 01:51:48.211
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2344
01:51:48.260 --> 01:51:50.530
<v Speaker 2>New Collector.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's illegal to sell cigarettes outside,</v>

2345
01:51:50.531 --> 01:51:53.500
<v Speaker 2>so tell them to get lost or don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll shake them down.</v>

2346
01:51:53.950 --> 01:51:57.850
<v Speaker 2>How about you hire a fucking lawyer to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go sue that guy and then you find out he</v>

2347
01:51:57.851 --> 01:51:59.230
<v Speaker 2>doesn't have any money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not gonna pay anyway.</v>

2348
01:51:59.350 --> 01:52:02.260
<v Speaker 2>There's your problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got a problem with tax collecting.</v>

2349
01:52:02.380 --> 01:52:04.120
<v Speaker 2>You don't have a pr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that guy rob somebody,</v>

2350
01:52:04.240 --> 01:52:09.240
<v Speaker 2>then you bring it up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jay walking and he comes in and he </v>

2351
01:52:09.240 --> 01:52:09.240
<v Speaker 2>breaks into your house and steals your </v>
<v Speaker 2>TV.</v>

2352
01:52:09.240 --> 01:52:10.810
<v Speaker 2>Then you have the cops,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but anything,</v>

2353
01:52:10.900 --> 01:52:13.360
<v Speaker 2>any use of that other than protecting </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

2354
01:52:13.630 --> 01:52:17.500
<v Speaker 2>Fucking choking a guy because he's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>paying cigarette tax.</v>

2355
01:52:17.950 --> 01:52:22.950
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck are the cops?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like New York plunged into </v>

2356
01:52:22.950 --> 01:52:23.320
<v Speaker 2>chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as they started enforcing,</v>

2357
01:52:24.160 --> 01:52:26.680
<v Speaker 2>write him a ticket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't much nicer.</v>

2358
01:52:26.690 --> 01:52:30.430
<v Speaker 2>The world would be if cops only acted in</v>
<v Speaker 2>that slow down manner,</v>

2359
01:52:30.460 --> 01:52:32.100
<v Speaker 2>but they don't act like that with big </v>
<v Speaker 2>black man.</v>

2360
01:52:32.101 --> 01:52:34.510
<v Speaker 2>There's a huge racism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be incredible.</v>

2361
01:52:34.511 --> 01:52:37.390
<v Speaker 2>Don't act though where you've been there</v>
<v Speaker 2>over the last few months.</v>

2362
01:52:37.420 --> 01:52:42.420
<v Speaker 2>You moved there like half the uh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is your experience like at the </v>

2363
01:52:42.420 --> 01:52:44.260
<v Speaker 2>difference racism out here as opposed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>erase all joined in here.</v>

2364
01:52:44.261 --> 01:52:46.070
<v Speaker 2>We're wastes more separated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

2365
01:52:46.070 --> 01:52:51.070
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we see shit like why </v>

2366
01:52:51.070 --> 01:52:51.350
<v Speaker 3>people don't even see the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they're constantly getting like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Arrest is,</v>

2368
01:52:52.970 --> 01:52:54.770

<v Speaker 3>time someone's like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>The second time the same shit happens.</v>

2371
01:52:58.521 --> 01:53:03.521
<v Speaker 3>A cop pushes you the fourth time out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>your car and they grab your wrist and </v>

2372
01:53:03.521 --> 01:53:03.521

<v Speaker 3>c'mon man.</v>

2373
01:53:03.521 --> 01:53:04.460
<v Speaker 3>If you pull back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've resisted arrest.</v>

2374
01:53:04.790 --> 01:53:06.910
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come on mom.</v>

<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

2376
01:53:08.750 --> 01:53:11.480
<v Speaker 3>Let's just talk about this first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've resisted arrest,</v>

2377
01:53:11.560 --> 01:53:16.560
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's up to their discretion whether or </v>

2378
01:53:16.560 --> 01:53:16.560
<v Speaker 3>not they choose to arrest you or known </v>
<v Speaker 3>restaurant people.</v>

2379
01:53:16.560 --> 01:53:19.160
<v Speaker 3>Some people get off on the exact same </v>
<v Speaker 3>charge and they skate.</v>

2380
01:53:19.250 --> 01:53:24.250
<v Speaker 3>Whereas other people get arrested like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>year old white guy with a suit and you </v>

2381
01:53:24.250 --> 01:53:26.960
<v Speaker 3>do a certain thing to stop and Frisk was</v>
<v Speaker 3>based on stop and Frisk people,</v>

2382
01:53:27.020 --> 01:53:29.780
<v Speaker 3>Latinos and blacks who looked like they </v>
<v Speaker 3>might have some shit.</v>

2383
01:53:29.810 --> 01:53:31.340
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 1>face throwing the gloves down,</v>

2458
01:56:24.181 --> 01:56:26.640
<v Speaker 1>screaming at each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A comics bat baseball game.</v>

01:56:27.420 --> 01:56:29.760
<v Speaker 1>But that's Boston Davey babies without </v>
<v Speaker 1>their bottles.</v>

2460
01:56:29.820 --> 01:56:31.620
<v Speaker 1>I was back at Boston that they fixed </v>
<v Speaker 1>that club,</v>

2461
01:56:31.860 --> 01:56:34.440
<v Speaker 1>that laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boston sound system is awesome.</v>

2462
01:56:34.441 --> 01:56:35.820
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to worry about it anymore</v>

2463
01:56:35.840 --> 01:56:40.840
<v Speaker 1>on the automation because everybody had </v>
<v Speaker 1>that rumor that was out at the sound </v>

2464
01:56:40.840 --> 01:56:43.611
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sucked is loud as fuck it did feedback </v>

2465
01:56:43.611 --> 01:56:43.790
<v Speaker 1>once when I got like on top of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2466
01:56:44.010 --> 01:56:47.730
<v Speaker 1>the actual speaker was talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that happens almost everywhere,</v>

2467
01:56:47.880 --> 01:56:48.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless it's perfect.</v>

2468
01:56:49.190 --> 01:56:54.190
<v Speaker 1>It's something the Improv does you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's never a fuck up if you're </v>

2469
01:56:54.190 --> 01:56:57.471
<v Speaker 1>working in Improv.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if the sound system's always </v>

2470
01:56:57.471 --> 01:56:57.600
<v Speaker 1>perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the seeding is always perfect.</v>

2471
01:56:57.601 --> 01:57:00.690
<v Speaker 1>There's never sight line issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't ever fuck around.</v>

2472
01:57:00.870 --> 01:57:02.940
<v Speaker 1>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some clubs that your work out there kind</v>

2473
01:57:02.941 --> 01:57:07.941
<v Speaker 1>of funky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you stand on one medium so you </v>

2474
01:57:07.941 --> 01:57:10.041
<v Speaker 1>can't even see flyballs yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was worse because there's often </v>

2475
01:57:10.041 --> 01:57:11.940
<v Speaker 1>pillars in the room and if you're behind</v>
<v Speaker 1>that pillar and you will go to the right</v>

2476
01:57:11.941 --> 01:57:16.941
<v Speaker 1>side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the people that are behind that </v>

2477
01:57:16.941 --> 01:57:16.941
<v Speaker 1>pillar literally can't even see you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they're there,</v>

2478
01:57:16.941 --> 01:57:18.750
<v Speaker 1>but unless they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to watch monitors in a club.</v>

2479
01:57:18.751 --> 01:57:21.470
<v Speaker 1>The improv has that nailed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They always say like,</v>

2480
01:57:21.480 --> 01:57:23.670
<v Speaker 1>nap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to set this up like that.</v>
