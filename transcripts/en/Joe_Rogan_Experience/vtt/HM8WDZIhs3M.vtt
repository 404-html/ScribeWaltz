1
00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.920
<v Speaker 1>I try so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

2
00:00:07.651 --> 00:00:10.740
<v Speaker 1>And we're live Hamilton Morris sober as </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>

3
00:00:10.741 --> 00:00:12.270
<v Speaker 1>How about you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

4
00:00:12.271 --> 00:00:17.271
<v Speaker 1>Say yes this time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we did a podcast seven years ago and </v>

5
00:00:17.271 --> 00:00:19.770
<v Speaker 1>most people apparently didn't know how </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked up we were,</v>

6
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.120
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I figured,</v>

7
00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:22.770
<v Speaker 1>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're here with Hamilton Morris.</v>

8
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.920
<v Speaker 1>We should go deep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we just kept hitting that joint </v>

9
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.450
<v Speaker 1>until I lost most of my grasp on reality</v>
<v Speaker 1>while we're talking.</v>

10
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.760
<v Speaker 1>It's just a very slippery conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just too high to form coherent </v>

11
00:00:36.871 --> 00:00:41.871
<v Speaker 1>thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just whatever I pieced together </v>

12
00:00:41.871 --> 00:00:41.871
<v Speaker 1>was just a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

13
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.430
<v Speaker 1>it was almost like miming a </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation,</v>

14
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.850
<v Speaker 1>but now seven years later and you have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>new place.</v>

15
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's beautiful.</v>

16
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you were at the early days.</v>

17
00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:52.360
<v Speaker 1>We did it at my house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

18
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:53.490
<v Speaker 1>that was way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

19
00:00:53.491 --> 00:00:56.040
<v Speaker 1>way back in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had no idea really.</v>

20
00:00:56.041 --> 00:01:01.041
<v Speaker 1>I knew you were of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't know about your podcast </v>

21
00:01:01.041 --> 00:01:01.041
<v Speaker 1>entirely.</v>

22
00:01:01.041 --> 00:01:05.300
<v Speaker 1>I'd seen clips of you on youtube and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't until I was driving home from </v>

23
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.390
<v Speaker 1>that recording and my phone just filled </v>
<v Speaker 1>with hundreds of emails that I realized,</v>

24
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.420
<v Speaker 1>Oh wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a serious phenomenon that I was </v>

25
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:15.810
<v Speaker 1>not aware of and now I see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just become huge.</v>

26
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.070
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

27
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.470
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

28
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.450
<v Speaker 1>it's got the wheel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just sort of have to show up.</v>

29
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.500
<v Speaker 1>It's a very strange and it sounds like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

30
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.470
<v Speaker 1>false modesty or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm just being totally honest,</v>

31
00:01:28.471 --> 00:01:33.471
<v Speaker 1>like this thing does itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of it might have to do </v>

32
00:01:33.471 --> 00:01:37.401
<v Speaker 1>with the long form because people are so</v>
<v Speaker 1>used to seeing people's opinions </v>

33
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:42.410
<v Speaker 1>condensed and filtered into these </v>
<v Speaker 1>soundbites and snippets and to hear an </v>

34
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:47.061
<v Speaker 1>extended conversation with someone where</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can actually tell stories and </v>

35
00:01:47.061 --> 00:01:48.890
<v Speaker 1>articulate their opinions and a nuanced </v>
<v Speaker 1>careful ways.</v>

36
00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.790
<v Speaker 1>So rare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

37
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.330
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the reasons why I don't do </v>
<v Speaker 1>those shows anymore,</v>

38
00:01:54.331 --> 00:01:57.210
<v Speaker 1>like panel shows and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just so frustrated.</v>

39
00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.320
<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have very little experience with that </v>

40
00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.810
<v Speaker 1>sort of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I did Dr Oz last year.</v>

41
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.430
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know how any normal person </v>

42
00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.510
<v Speaker 1>could function and that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>

43
00:02:09.511 --> 00:02:11.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a TV show,</v>

44
00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:14.760
<v Speaker 1>so arguably I'm well trained for that </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of thing,</v>

45
00:02:14.761 --> 00:02:19.200
<v Speaker 1>but unless you're an actor who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>prepared a line to say,</v>

46
00:02:19.201 --> 00:02:24.201
<v Speaker 1>as soon as they point at you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no way that you could function </v>

47
00:02:24.201 --> 00:02:27.171
<v Speaker 1>because it's not a genuine conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just an opportunity to launch one </v>

48
00:02:27.171 --> 00:02:27.690
<v Speaker 1>sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sound bites and an audience applause.</v>

49
00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.430
<v Speaker 1>And also the audience is such a strange </v>
<v Speaker 1>element to add to a conversation.</v>

50
00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you and I were having this </v>

51
00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:38.841
<v Speaker 1>conversation exactly in this room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to the left of us is an enormous </v>

52
00:02:40.531 --> 00:02:41.460
<v Speaker 1>group of people.</v>

53
00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.830
<v Speaker 1>We've feel weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd have to address them,</v>

54
00:02:43.831 --> 00:02:48.831
<v Speaker 1>we'd have to turn to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be odd following illuminated </v>

55
00:02:48.831 --> 00:02:49.830
<v Speaker 1>applause and laughter signs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>

56
00:02:49.831 --> 00:02:54.831
<v Speaker 1>Those are the weirdest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When there's always the warmup guys </v>

57
00:02:54.831 --> 00:02:54.831
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

58
00:02:54.831 --> 00:02:55.440
<v Speaker 1>we're ready.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're coming back from break coming back</v>

59
00:02:55.441 --> 00:02:57.870
<v Speaker 1>from Craig and they hold up the sign and</v>
<v Speaker 1>applause,</v>

60
00:02:57.871 --> 00:02:58.770
<v Speaker 1>applause,</v>
<v Speaker 1>applause.</v>

61
00:02:58.771 --> 00:03:01.660
<v Speaker 1>And everybody goes crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the create the worst environment.</v>

62
00:03:01.661 --> 00:03:02.930
<v Speaker 1>I was on this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

63
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.620
<v Speaker 1>discussion about [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you familiar with this?</v>

64
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm on it right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

65
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just took some.</v>

66
00:03:08.081 --> 00:03:09.850
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fucked my knee up the other day.</v>

67
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.930
<v Speaker 1>I did something and it's been stiff and </v>
<v Speaker 1>painful.</v>

68
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.270
<v Speaker 1>So I used it before I came here and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just took,</v>

69
00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.880
<v Speaker 1>took six of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See what happens.</v>

70
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.710
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 ones.</v>

71
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:22.790
<v Speaker 1>10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One gram.</v>

72
00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:25.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

73
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.960
<v Speaker 1>Can you grab that bag?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a bag that's sitting right on </v>

74
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.960
<v Speaker 1>the sink.</v>

75
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:31.960
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you exactly what's in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

76
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:35.050
<v Speaker 1>now I get why people might think it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>drug.</v>

77
00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.730
<v Speaker 1>What is the drug?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

78
00:03:36.731 --> 00:03:38.530
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when I took four,</v>

79
00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:39.640
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

80
00:03:39.641 --> 00:03:44.641
<v Speaker 1>I took two for the first time I took it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took two and a couple of times I took </v>

81
00:03:44.641 --> 00:03:44.641
<v Speaker 1>to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

82
00:03:44.641 --> 00:03:48.351
<v Speaker 1>this is like a mild stimulant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then when you get into the range of </v>

83
00:03:48.351 --> 00:03:49.420
<v Speaker 1>eight to 10 pills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

84
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:50.290
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

85
00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.480
<v Speaker 1>this will fuck you up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This stuff.</v>

86
00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.760
<v Speaker 1>The stuff I take is urban ice organics </v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

87
00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.650
<v Speaker 1>see it says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it says take two.</v>

88
00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:08.330
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't say the amount of material in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the capsule was say 750 milligrams.</v>

89
00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.320
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so not quite a gram,</v>

90
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:13.780
<v Speaker 1>not quite a gram.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

91
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.870
<v Speaker 1>It seems like a reasonable amount,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they always construct these things </v>

92
00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:19.810
<v Speaker 1>in these ridiculous dramatic </v>
<v Speaker 1>oppositions.</v>

93
00:04:19.811 --> 00:04:24.811
<v Speaker 1>Like it was me versus a woman whose son </v>
<v Speaker 1>had died of some Creton associated </v>

94
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.480
<v Speaker 1>overdose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it turns into a thing like,</v>

95
00:04:28.481 --> 00:04:33.481
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you have to say to this woman </v>

96
00:04:33.481 --> 00:04:33.481
<v Speaker 1>whose son died?</v>

97
00:04:33.481 --> 00:04:33.780
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

98
00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.810
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are people that die from caffeine </v>

99
00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.810
<v Speaker 1>overdoses as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's tragic that this happened.</v>

100
00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:40.600
<v Speaker 1>How people died from this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

101
00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.270
<v Speaker 1>They have to have to take an enormous </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount.</v>

102
00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:48.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people set up these </v>

103
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.300
<v Speaker 1>unrealistic expectations with these </v>
<v Speaker 1>drugs where they,</v>

104
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.531
<v Speaker 1>if they'd like a drug,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to say it's impossible for it </v>

105
00:04:52.531 --> 00:04:52.531
<v Speaker 1>to kill anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's impossible.</v>

106
00:04:52.531 --> 00:04:54.760
<v Speaker 1>There's no possible way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you set that as your standard,</v>

107
00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:59.850
<v Speaker 1>you'll always fail because people will </v>
<v Speaker 1>die doing absolutely everything.</v>

108
00:05:00.311 --> 00:05:02.530
<v Speaker 1>Running,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having sex deprecating aspirin,</v>

109
00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:04.150
<v Speaker 1>aspirin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

110
00:05:04.151 --> 00:05:08.680
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing in this world that can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>find its way into a human death.</v>

111
00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.490
<v Speaker 1>So if people want to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even you know,</v>

112
00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:16.530
<v Speaker 1>cannabis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously people say you can't overdose </v>

113
00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.081
<v Speaker 1>on cannabis and essentially you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you look in the medical </v>

114
00:05:19.081 --> 00:05:21.751
<v Speaker 1>literature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are a number of these cannabis </v>

115
00:05:21.751 --> 00:05:21.751
<v Speaker 1>associated fatalities.</v>

116
00:05:21.751 --> 00:05:22.060
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can debate them endlessly,</v>

117
00:05:22.061 --> 00:05:27.061
<v Speaker 1>but the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once a drug enters a large enough </v>

118
00:05:27.061 --> 00:05:29.671
<v Speaker 1>population,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there'll be a number of sensitive </v>

119
00:05:29.671 --> 00:05:31.801
<v Speaker 1>individuals and someone will die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean that the drug is </v>

120
00:05:31.801 --> 00:05:34.921
<v Speaker 1>dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means that it's unrealistic to set a </v>

121
00:05:34.921 --> 00:05:34.921
<v Speaker 1>standard where if anything bad happens </v>
<v Speaker 1>to anyone,</v>

122
00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.930
<v Speaker 1>we have to decide that the drug is </v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous and should be banned.</v>

123
00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:39.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

124
00:05:39.281 --> 00:05:39.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

125
00:05:39.971 --> 00:05:44.971
<v Speaker 1>water kills people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of these hazing things </v>

126
00:05:44.971 --> 00:05:48.571
<v Speaker 1>where the fraternity kids will be asked </v>
<v Speaker 1>to drink a shit ton of water and Oh </v>

127
00:05:49.201 --> 00:05:50.380
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have died from it.</v>

128
00:05:50.381 --> 00:05:54.060
<v Speaker 1>A woman died in San Jose a few years </v>
<v Speaker 1>back from a,</v>

129
00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:59.450
<v Speaker 1>a contest to drink water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get her son like an xbox or something </v>

130
00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:00.420
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

131
00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:01.100
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

132
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:05.180
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of things that are lethal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the ld 50 for cannabis,</v>

133
00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:10.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you literally have to smoke your body </v>

134
00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:10.190
<v Speaker 1>weight or something.</v>

135
00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:13.000
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something crazy would be very </v>

136
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:13.000
<v Speaker 1>difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

137
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.150
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't mean that you couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>get so high that you did something </v>

138
00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:16.680
<v Speaker 1>really stupid wind up dying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

139
00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially dependent upon the person and</v>

140
00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:22.340
<v Speaker 1>the biological variability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

141
00:06:22.341 --> 00:06:23.420
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

142
00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:28.870
<v Speaker 1>And it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's also just as sort of a bad </v>

143
00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.211
<v Speaker 1>road to go down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People always want to emphasize the </v>

144
00:06:31.211 --> 00:06:31.211
<v Speaker 1>safety of things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in my opinion,</v>

145
00:06:31.211 --> 00:06:35.051
<v Speaker 1>safety isn't the point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't ultimately matter to me </v>

146
00:06:35.051 --> 00:06:37.010
<v Speaker 1>whether or not something is safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we should have the freedom to do</v>

147
00:06:37.011 --> 00:06:39.830
<v Speaker 1>dangerous things if we choose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're allowed to ride.</v>

148
00:06:39.831 --> 00:06:44.831
<v Speaker 1>Motorcycles were allowed to shoot guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're allowed to go skydiving and </v>

149
00:06:44.831 --> 00:06:46.700
<v Speaker 1>bungee jumping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All those things carry risks,</v>

150
00:06:46.701 --> 00:06:49.850
<v Speaker 1>but it's assumed that any adult that </v>
<v Speaker 1>does them is aware of those risks.</v>

151
00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:50.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't agree more.</v>

152
00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:53.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also who is.</v>

153
00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:56.300
<v Speaker 1>If the society that we live in was just </v>
<v Speaker 1>you and I was,</v>

154
00:06:56.390 --> 00:07:01.390
<v Speaker 1>we were the only two people alive who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are you to tell me what I can do or me </v>

155
00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:01.880
<v Speaker 1>to tell you what you can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous.</v>

156
00:07:01.881 --> 00:07:06.881
<v Speaker 1>And so when you have grown adults </v>
<v Speaker 1>telling a grown adult who's informed </v>

157
00:07:06.881 --> 00:07:08.870
<v Speaker 1>what they can and can't do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it becomes a question of children.</v>

158
00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:13.190
<v Speaker 1>Well then it becomes an education issue </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it becomes a parental issue.</v>

159
00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:16.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't lie to your children about the</v>

160
00:07:16.371 --> 00:07:21.371
<v Speaker 1>effects of certain drugs because then </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to believe you about </v>

161
00:07:21.371 --> 00:07:21.371
<v Speaker 1>the really actual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the actual dangerous ones.</v>

162
00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:26.550
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is of course reflected in the </v>

163
00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:26.780
<v Speaker 1>so called opioid epidemic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

164
00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:27.860
<v Speaker 1>Right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

165
00:07:27.861 --> 00:07:32.861
<v Speaker 1>There's endless finger pointing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone wants to find a culprit that's </v>

166
00:07:32.861 --> 00:07:34.100
<v Speaker 1>behind all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the easiest person to blame,</v>

167
00:07:34.101 --> 00:07:39.101
<v Speaker 1>of course our pharmaceutical companies </v>
<v Speaker 1>because everybody hates pharmaceutical </v>

168
00:07:39.101 --> 00:07:39.101
<v Speaker 1>companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so why not blame them?</v>

169
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:44.500
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not pro pharmaceutical by any </v>

170
00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:48.521
<v Speaker 1>stretch of the imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm also not anti pharmaceutical </v>

171
00:07:48.521 --> 00:07:49.970
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you look at the way,</v>

172
00:07:49.971 --> 00:07:54.971
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the New York Times is covering the </v>

173
00:07:54.971 --> 00:07:57.161
<v Speaker 1>opioid epidemic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always in this tone of like </v>

174
00:07:57.161 --> 00:08:00.190
<v Speaker 1>documents were uncovered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the show that executives at Purdue </v>

175
00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:04.420
<v Speaker 1>Pharma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're aware that morphine was addictive </v>

176
00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:04.670
<v Speaker 1>as early as 1999.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

177
00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:06.170
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

178
00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:11.680
<v Speaker 1>of course they were aware of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People have known that morphine is </v>

179
00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.781
<v Speaker 1>addictive for hundreds of years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is old news and this whole idea </v>

180
00:08:13.781 --> 00:08:18.011
<v Speaker 1>that doctors were convinced by some </v>
<v Speaker 1>letter in the New England Journal of </v>

181
00:08:18.011 --> 00:08:20.270
<v Speaker 1>Medicine that said that Oxycontin isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>addictive,</v>

182
00:08:20.271 --> 00:08:22.250
<v Speaker 1>is absurd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are all morphine derivatives.</v>

183
00:08:22.251 --> 00:08:24.380
<v Speaker 1>Any adult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially a medically trained adults,</v>

184
00:08:24.381 --> 00:08:27.890
<v Speaker 1>should know that no matter what little </v>
<v Speaker 1>variation you make on that molecule,</v>

185
00:08:27.891 --> 00:08:32.891
<v Speaker 1>if it's structurally and </v>
<v Speaker 1>pharmacologically and qualitatively </v>

186
00:08:32.891 --> 00:08:33.080
<v Speaker 1>similar to morphine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course it's going to be addictive.</v>

187
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:35.690
<v Speaker 1>And that in of itself isn't even a bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

188
00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:38.420
<v Speaker 1>It should be okay to give people </v>
<v Speaker 1>addictive drugs as well.</v>

189
00:08:38.421 --> 00:08:40.130
<v Speaker 1>As long as everyone's aware of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>risks,</v>

190
00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:42.380
<v Speaker 1>as long as they understand the protocol </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get off of it.</v>

191
00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:44.000
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

192
00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:49.090
<v Speaker 1>there's so many people that get on these</v>
<v Speaker 1>things and then wind up taking them far </v>

193
00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:51.980
<v Speaker 1>longer than they're supposed to because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's easy to get hooked.</v>

194
00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:56.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean we need to at least have some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of responsible</v>

195
00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:02.300
<v Speaker 2>direction of these people need to go to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get off of them once they're on them </v>

196
00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:07.730
<v Speaker 2>because people that get back operations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any anything where they prescribe you </v>

197
00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:10.560
<v Speaker 2>high doses of opiates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a huge problem.</v>

198
00:09:10.561 --> 00:09:15.561
<v Speaker 2>I know many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many people that have gotten hooked </v>

199
00:09:15.561 --> 00:09:17.271
<v Speaker 2>because of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in fact I should tell you that my </v>

200
00:09:17.271 --> 00:09:19.131
<v Speaker 2>good friend Justin wren,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his wife found out about Kratom because </v>

201
00:09:19.131 --> 00:09:19.800
<v Speaker 2>of you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of your show,</v>

202
00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:25.350
<v Speaker 2>he had a problem with his shoulder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got shoulder shoulder surgery,</v>

203
00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:30.530
<v Speaker 2>they put them on Oxycontin's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was fucked up on them and he was </v>

204
00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:32.190
<v Speaker 2>having a really hard time getting off </v>
<v Speaker 2>and having the shakes really bad.</v>

205
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:34.330
<v Speaker 2>And Kratom is the only thing that got </v>
<v Speaker 2>them off it.</v>

206
00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:36.300
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's not surprising.</v>

207
00:09:36.301 --> 00:09:41.301
<v Speaker 1>I mean this has been known for a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>long time in Thailand and that was </v>

208
00:09:41.301 --> 00:09:42.480
<v Speaker 1>actually the reason that it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>originally prohibited.</v>

209
00:09:42.481 --> 00:09:47.481
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you're aware of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because the government taxed opium </v>

210
00:09:47.481 --> 00:09:51.830
<v Speaker 1>and people started using Creton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they made Creton Elisa the right </v>

211
00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:55.611
<v Speaker 1>way to say it because people say Kratom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're the only one I've heard say </v>

212
00:09:55.611 --> 00:09:55.611
<v Speaker 1>Krypton people in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a Thai word.</v>

213
00:09:55.611 --> 00:09:59.370
<v Speaker 1>People in Thailand call it people in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>US called Kratom.</v>

214
00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:00.600
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

215
00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:01.500
<v Speaker 1>it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have,</v>

216
00:10:01.501 --> 00:10:02.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is maybe it's like Crikey,</v>

217
00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:07.930
<v Speaker 1>dom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that we're not going to go to </v>

218
00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:07.930
<v Speaker 1>that forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tom is closer.</v>

219
00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:07.930
<v Speaker 1>If you did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be weird,</v>

220
00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:13.710
<v Speaker 1>but I feel as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like American people that say Ecuador,</v>

221
00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:18.080
<v Speaker 1>Argentina,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is Creton Creton.</v>

222
00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:23.150
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we'll try to call it quits or </v>

223
00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:23.150
<v Speaker 1>something close to that.</v>

224
00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:23.150
<v Speaker 1>It's closer to that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kratom.</v>

225
00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:27.200
<v Speaker 1>And so the reason why I was made illegal</v>
<v Speaker 1>was because of the fact that it was </v>

226
00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:27.990
<v Speaker 1>pinching some of the profits off of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>opium trade.</v>

227
00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.160
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

228
00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:30.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fucked up.</v>

229
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:35.630
<v Speaker 1>And so this has been known for a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time that it helps people get off more </v>

230
00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:36.810
<v Speaker 1>addictive opioids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how does it do that?</v>

231
00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:42.170
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an opioid itself and a lot of </v>

232
00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:42.170
<v Speaker 1>people don't want to admit or </v>
<v Speaker 1>acknowledge that,</v>

233
00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:46.191
<v Speaker 1>but I think we need to get beyond this </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that drugs are inherently bad or </v>

234
00:10:46.191 --> 00:10:49.791
<v Speaker 1>opioids are inherently bad just because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones that we're aware of have a lot </v>

235
00:10:49.791 --> 00:10:50.060
<v Speaker 1>of problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

236
00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:53.460
<v Speaker 1>in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>medicinal chemistry and pharmacology and</v>

237
00:10:53.461 --> 00:10:58.461
<v Speaker 1>all of this are still in a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>primitive state and there's so much to </v>

238
00:10:58.461 --> 00:11:01.911
<v Speaker 1>be learned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're mostly giving people these </v>

239
00:11:01.911 --> 00:11:04.170
<v Speaker 1>derivatives of morphine that have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>around for a hundred years and there are</v>

240
00:11:04.171 --> 00:11:05.100
<v Speaker 1>better things.</v>

241
00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:10.180
<v Speaker 1>We're going to continuously discover </v>
<v Speaker 1>less addictive treatments for pain and I</v>

242
00:11:10.741 --> 00:11:15.741
<v Speaker 1>think that the alkaloids in Kratom are a</v>
<v Speaker 1>step in that direction and which is so </v>

243
00:11:16.831 --> 00:11:21.831
<v Speaker 1>tragic that they're trying to now make </v>
<v Speaker 1>it illegal because this is something </v>

244
00:11:21.831 --> 00:11:25.881
<v Speaker 1>that as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has genuinely helped an enormous number </v>

245
00:11:25.881 --> 00:11:29.530
<v Speaker 1>of people reduce their intake of more </v>
<v Speaker 1>addictive and more dangerous opioids.</v>

246
00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:31.060
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that I've felt,</v>

247
00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

248
00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:36.430
<v Speaker 1>my dose was not extremely high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I was on it,</v>

249
00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:38.440
<v Speaker 1>I was very coherent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was clear.</v>

250
00:11:38.441 --> 00:11:40.510
<v Speaker 1>It was clear to me that was affected by </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

251
00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:44.560
<v Speaker 1>but it felt kinda good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't feel bad.</v>

252
00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:48.520
<v Speaker 1>It felt a little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little uneasy,</v>

253
00:11:48.521 --> 00:11:49.660
<v Speaker 1>like a little like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>

254
00:11:49.661 --> 00:11:51.970
<v Speaker 1>this world feels a little weird right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

255
00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:56.290
<v Speaker 1>but it not feel like A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was impaired.</v>

256
00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:59.260
<v Speaker 1>Like I know a lot of people who take it </v>
<v Speaker 1>an exercise,</v>

257
00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:00.880
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend,</v>

258
00:12:00.881 --> 00:12:05.881
<v Speaker 1>he'll take 10 pills and exercise just </v>
<v Speaker 1>just seems kind of fucking crazy.</v>

259
00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.940
<v Speaker 1>But he says he has a great workout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

260
00:12:09.941 --> 00:12:11.590
<v Speaker 1>We're taking that stuff before he works </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

261
00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:16.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it seems to lend itself to a lot </v>

262
00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:18.691
<v Speaker 1>of different applications in Thailand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's used almost exclusively for that </v>

263
00:12:18.691 --> 00:12:19.060
<v Speaker 1>sort of purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the south,</v>

264
00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:23.560
<v Speaker 1>it's a drug that Labor is used so they </v>
<v Speaker 1>can collect the latex foam,</v>

265
00:12:23.561 --> 00:12:27.400
<v Speaker 1>rubber trees and just get their job </v>
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>

266
00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:29.020
<v Speaker 1>That's what it's about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

267
00:12:29.021 --> 00:12:30.970
<v Speaker 1>that's what opioids are about for a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the world,</v>

268
00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:34.870
<v Speaker 1>both in the United States and in Africa </v>
<v Speaker 1>and in Thailand is,</v>

269
00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:36.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people live hard lives and,</v>

270
00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:42.030
<v Speaker 1>and manual labor is painful and </v>
<v Speaker 1>repetitive and difficult and anything </v>

271
00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:45.811
<v Speaker 1>that makes that a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 1>manageable is very important tool for </v>

272
00:12:45.811 --> 00:12:50.671
<v Speaker 1>humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always felt like people that did </v>

273
00:12:50.671 --> 00:12:51.100
<v Speaker 1>heroin or opiates or something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

274
00:12:51.101 --> 00:12:53.520
<v Speaker 1>we're on a very short road to death </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

275
00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:55.150
<v Speaker 1>that was my perception when I was a kid.</v>

276
00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:57.460
<v Speaker 1>And then I had a friend who was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>longshoreman.</v>

277
00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:02.490
<v Speaker 1>They worked on the docks bring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would bring fish in and fillet the </v>

278
00:13:03.791 --> 00:13:06.830
<v Speaker 1>fish for the market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

279
00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:10.990
<v Speaker 1>he worked with a guy that everyday at </v>
<v Speaker 1>lunch the guy would go cop,</v>

280
00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:16.050
<v Speaker 1>he would get his heroin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who would shoot it up in his car and </v>

281
00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:16.050
<v Speaker 1>then he'd go back to work and I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

282
00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:17.350
<v Speaker 1>he'd go back to work and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

283
00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:22.380
<v Speaker 1>He worked everyday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like everyday shot up and everyday he </v>

284
00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:22.380
<v Speaker 1>worked like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

285
00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:22.600
<v Speaker 1>it was never late.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nope,</v>

286
00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:25.360
<v Speaker 1>just did his work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

287
00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:28.300
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think you could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought you did heroin,</v>

288
00:13:28.301 --> 00:13:33.301
<v Speaker 1>the next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd just be on the floor in a fetal </v>

289
00:13:33.301 --> 00:13:35.851
<v Speaker 1>position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your own urine and you would fall </v>

290
00:13:35.851 --> 00:13:35.851
<v Speaker 1>apart and die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

291
00:13:35.851 --> 00:13:40.050
<v Speaker 1>Yet there's this idea that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes refer to as pharmacological </v>

292
00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:42.460
<v Speaker 1>determinism that a certain drug has to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do a certain thing,</v>

293
00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:45.700
<v Speaker 1>so alcohol has to sedate and disinhibit </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

294
00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:49.930
<v Speaker 1>Heroine has to addict you and make you a</v>
<v Speaker 1>slave to it and kill you.</v>

295
00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:53.830
<v Speaker 1>Cocaine has to be a euphoric thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's done at parties.</v>

296
00:13:53.831 --> 00:13:58.831
<v Speaker 1>That's also very addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>PCP has to make you strip nude and run </v>

297
00:13:58.831 --> 00:14:03.211
<v Speaker 1>around a fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly fighting cops and punching </v>

298
00:14:03.211 --> 00:14:05.120
<v Speaker 1>holes and wooden fences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

299
00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:07.360
<v Speaker 1>but when you look at this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

300
00:14:07.361 --> 00:14:12.361
<v Speaker 1>anthropologists have looked at certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>drugs that are used cross culturally </v>

301
00:14:12.361 --> 00:14:15.301
<v Speaker 1>like alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what you find is this whole idea of </v>

302
00:14:15.301 --> 00:14:17.350
<v Speaker 1>pharmacological determinism is </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally flawed.</v>

303
00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:22.860
<v Speaker 1>Drugs behave differently in different </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultures depending on the set and </v>

304
00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:27.151
<v Speaker 1>setting of the user.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you find all sorts of instances </v>

305
00:14:27.701 --> 00:14:32.701
<v Speaker 1>that are major exceptions to these rules</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we've set up for these various </v>

306
00:14:32.701 --> 00:14:32.701
<v Speaker 1>drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

307
00:14:32.701 --> 00:14:37.501
<v Speaker 1>PCP,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is arguably one of the most </v>

308
00:14:37.501 --> 00:14:38.050
<v Speaker 1>ubiquitously maligned drugs in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

309
00:14:38.051 --> 00:14:40.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean no one can imagine that PCP is </v>
<v Speaker 1>medicinal,</v>

310
00:14:40.391 --> 00:14:45.391
<v Speaker 1>but even to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pcps and schedule to not schedule one </v>

311
00:14:45.391 --> 00:14:48.820
<v Speaker 1>like cannabis and LSD schedule to it can</v>
<v Speaker 1>still be prescribed actually.</v>

312
00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:52.190
<v Speaker 1>And that's because it had a history of </v>
<v Speaker 1>medicinal</v>

313
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:57.250
<v Speaker 3>use.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was even PCP psychotherapy in the </v>

314
00:14:57.250 --> 00:14:57.250
<v Speaker 3>UK,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>

315
00:14:57.250 --> 00:15:01.720
<v Speaker 3>in the fifties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is a something that most people </v>

316
00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:06.521
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't believe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to those patients that were taking </v>

317
00:15:06.521 --> 00:15:09.311
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then there was none of this cultural </v>

318
00:15:09.311 --> 00:15:11.441
<v Speaker 3>association with PCP being a drug that </v>
<v Speaker 3>causes psychosis or makes you strip </v>

319
00:15:11.441 --> 00:15:15.431
<v Speaker 3>nude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who is simply another tool for a </v>

320
00:15:15.431 --> 00:15:17.771
<v Speaker 3>psychiatrist to use and help people </v>
<v Speaker 3>release repressed memories or traumas </v>

321
00:15:18.771 --> 00:15:20.870
<v Speaker 3>that they were afraid to talk about when</v>
<v Speaker 3>sober.</v>

322
00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:23.630
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're seeing that now with Mtma,</v>

323
00:15:23.631 --> 00:15:24.290
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

324
00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:26.780
<v Speaker 4>and also ketamine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ketamine,</v>

325
00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:30.500
<v Speaker 4>you being used as an actual tool for </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychotherapy,</v>

326
00:15:30.501 --> 00:15:33.800
<v Speaker 4>particularly for people with depression.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So having really good results.</v>

327
00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:34.370
<v Speaker 4>My,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

328
00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:36.820
<v Speaker 4>my friend,</v>
<v Speaker 4>excuse me,</v>

329
00:15:36.821 --> 00:15:40.120
<v Speaker 4>Neil Brennan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who is a hilarious comedian.</v>

330
00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.070
<v Speaker 4>He's had struggles with depression.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

331
00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:44.290
<v Speaker 4>he got great relief from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

332
00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:44.650
<v Speaker 4>from</v>

333
00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:46.370
<v Speaker 3>taking ketamine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

334
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:48.440
<v Speaker 3>And what I think is really interesting </v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

335
00:15:48.441 --> 00:15:53.441
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is often packaged as a sort of </v>

336
00:15:53.441 --> 00:15:54.410
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic renaissance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think in a larger context,</v>

337
00:15:54.411 --> 00:15:59.411
<v Speaker 3>it's a drug facilitated psychotherapy </v>
<v Speaker 3>renaissance because this was not just </v>

338
00:15:59.411 --> 00:16:03.941
<v Speaker 3>limited to psychedelics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People did something called narco </v>

339
00:16:03.941 --> 00:16:06.230
<v Speaker 3>analysis where they would give people </v>
<v Speaker 3>sedatives like propofol.</v>

340
00:16:06.231 --> 00:16:09.340
<v Speaker 3>The drug that killed Michael Jackson or </v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

341
00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:15.130
<v Speaker 3>various barbiturates or various other </v>
<v Speaker 3>drugs and the relaxing effect would </v>

342
00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:16.730
<v Speaker 3>allow people to talk more openly to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>therapist.</v>

343
00:16:16.731 --> 00:16:21.731
<v Speaker 3>And it was considered very effective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now this idea of a psychiatrist </v>

344
00:16:21.731 --> 00:16:25.450
<v Speaker 3>injecting you with a drug in order to </v>
<v Speaker 3>help you talk about your problems is </v>

345
00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:26.930
<v Speaker 3>it's unheard of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think anyone does it anymore,</v>

346
00:16:26.931 --> 00:16:31.931
<v Speaker 3>but it used to be very common and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think a return to that is going to be </v>

347
00:16:31.931 --> 00:16:31.931
<v Speaker 3>really beneficial.</v>

348
00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:32.760
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

349
00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:37.800
<v Speaker 4>I agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the right drugs with the right </v>

350
00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:40.741
<v Speaker 4>cases and the right people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think we've got to get past these </v>

351
00:16:40.741 --> 00:16:43.651
<v Speaker 4>schedules that when you have things like</v>
<v Speaker 4>marijuana and silicide been and </v>

352
00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:48.810
<v Speaker 4>especially DMT,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which your own body produces is a </v>

353
00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:50.080
<v Speaker 4>schedule one drug and the famous Terence</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mckenna line.</v>

354
00:16:50.081 --> 00:16:52.000
<v Speaker 4>We're all holding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

355
00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:53.950
<v Speaker 4>when it comes to Dmt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just stupid.</v>

356
00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:56.500
<v Speaker 4>It's just stupid that these things are </v>
<v Speaker 4>scheduled one.</v>

357
00:16:56.501 --> 00:16:59.570
<v Speaker 4>When you're saying there's no medical </v>
<v Speaker 4>benefit whatsoever,</v>

358
00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:03.280
<v Speaker 4>a medical application for cannabis is </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking crazy.</v>

359
00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:08.580
<v Speaker 4>When something that you want to have </v>
<v Speaker 4>something that really actively promotes </v>

360
00:17:09.501 --> 00:17:14.501
<v Speaker 4>a distrust in law enforcement,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the scheduling of drugs is one of the </v>

361
00:17:14.501 --> 00:17:18.131
<v Speaker 4>best ones because when you look at </v>
<v Speaker 4>something like marijuana and you see </v>

362
00:17:18.131 --> 00:17:21.791
<v Speaker 4>that that's a schedule one drug that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that that's infuriating to people that </v>

363
00:17:22.101 --> 00:17:25.190
<v Speaker 4>gain huge benefits from cannabis.</v>

364
00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:28.340
<v Speaker 4>I mean people that have going through </v>
<v Speaker 4>chemotherapy,</v>

365
00:17:28.341 --> 00:17:30.010
<v Speaker 4>people that have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

366
00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:35.030
<v Speaker 4>a interocular pressure from Glaucoma.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you can go down the list over and</v>

367
00:17:35.691 --> 00:17:38.720
<v Speaker 4>over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The kids that have epilepsy,</v>

368
00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:42.690
<v Speaker 4>there's so many people that have had </v>
<v Speaker 4>great benefit,</v>

369
00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:46.040
<v Speaker 4>particularly from edible cannabis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People that have seizures,</v>

370
00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:48.350
<v Speaker 4>I mean you could keep going on and on </v>
<v Speaker 4>and on.</v>

371
00:17:48.351 --> 00:17:53.351
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's an amazing plant and to have that </v>

372
00:17:53.351 --> 00:17:57.210
<v Speaker 4>demonized because of some ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 4>propaganda from the 19 thirties that </v>

373
00:17:57.210 --> 00:17:59.830
<v Speaker 4>still somehow or another clung on in </v>
<v Speaker 4>2018.</v>

374
00:17:59.831 --> 00:18:04.831
<v Speaker 4>We think about all the information we </v>
<v Speaker 4>have now with the Internet and the fact </v>

375
00:18:04.831 --> 00:18:05.620
<v Speaker 4>that cannabis is still scheduled.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One,</v>

376
00:18:05.621 --> 00:18:09.160
<v Speaker 4>you have assholes like jeff sessions </v>
<v Speaker 4>still saying things like,</v>

377
00:18:09.161 --> 00:18:13.150
<v Speaker 4>good people don't smoke marijuana like </v>
<v Speaker 4>this is crazy talk.</v>

378
00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:15.820
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but keep in mind it was just about a 100</v>

379
00:18:15.821 --> 00:18:20.821
<v Speaker 3>years ago that alcohol was prohibited in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the United States and it took 13 years </v>

380
00:18:20.821 --> 00:18:25.480
<v Speaker 3>to reverse that and that was alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no drug more integrated into our</v>

381
00:18:25.481 --> 00:18:28.960
<v Speaker 3>culture than alcohol and that took 13 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years to reverse.</v>

382
00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:33.000
<v Speaker 4>What was that like back then?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That must have been madness when alcohol</v>

383
00:18:33.001 --> 00:18:38.001
<v Speaker 4>was illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When the cops would come in and </v>

384
00:18:38.001 --> 00:18:39.831
<v Speaker 4>jackbooted thugs would knock over jen </v>
<v Speaker 4>mills and bust open kegs of whiskey and </v>

385
00:18:40.291 --> 00:18:41.670
<v Speaker 4>spill it all out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

386
00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:43.380
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck was that like?</v>

387
00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:45.120
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was disastrous.</v>

388
00:18:45.121 --> 00:18:50.121
<v Speaker 3>But I think what's interesting about </v>
<v Speaker 3>that is it was a worthwhile experiment </v>

389
00:18:50.121 --> 00:18:53.190
<v Speaker 3>to give them the benefit of the doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was worthwhile to see because on some</v>

390
00:18:53.191 --> 00:18:56.550
<v Speaker 3>sense you could say the prohibition has </v>
<v Speaker 3>a certain logic to it.</v>

391
00:18:56.580 --> 00:19:01.580
<v Speaker 3>You could say drugs caused problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if we just make all the drugs </v>

392
00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:05.841
<v Speaker 3>illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then maybe those problems will </v>

393
00:19:05.841 --> 00:19:05.841
<v Speaker 3>disappear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it didn't work.</v>

394
00:19:05.841 --> 00:19:10.551
<v Speaker 3>The experiment failed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's nothing wrong with a failed </v>

395
00:19:10.551 --> 00:19:11.510
<v Speaker 3>experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a problem if you keep repeating</v>

396
00:19:11.511 --> 00:19:15.410
<v Speaker 3>it over and over and over again for 100 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years looking for a different result.</v>

397
00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:18.070
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then go to other drugs and go,</v>

398
00:19:18.071 --> 00:19:18.610
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this one,</v>

399
00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:20.680
<v Speaker 4>let's try this one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's make this one illegal.</v>

400
00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:22.090
<v Speaker 4>And it's a terrible</v>

401
00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:26.080
<v Speaker 3>pr situation for the police as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I were a police officer,</v>

402
00:19:26.081 --> 00:19:31.081
<v Speaker 3>I'd be the biggest opponent of the war </v>
<v Speaker 3>on drugs and have anyone in the </v>

403
00:19:31.081 --> 00:19:34.591
<v Speaker 3>government.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because when you think about why does </v>

404
00:19:34.591 --> 00:19:35.500
<v Speaker 3>the average person in New York City love</v>
<v Speaker 3>of firefighter,</v>

405
00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:38.290
<v Speaker 3>they love firefighters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they hate cops.</v>

406
00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:40.550
<v Speaker 3>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's because of the drug war.</v>

407
00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:45.580
<v Speaker 3>Because a firefighter isn't going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>hurt you for something that wasn't </v>

408
00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:47.870
<v Speaker 3>really a crime to begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for some kind of victimless crime.</v>

409
00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:51.290
<v Speaker 3>A firefighter is just there to help you </v>
<v Speaker 3>to save you if you're in trouble,</v>

410
00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:54.800
<v Speaker 3>and the same would be true of police </v>
<v Speaker 3>officers if it weren't for the drug war.</v>

411
00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:55.810
<v Speaker 3>Ideally</v>

412
00:19:55.880 --> 00:20:00.880
<v Speaker 4>there's a little more complexity to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's certainly certainly more </v>

413
00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:03.110
<v Speaker 4>complexity when it comes to shootings </v>
<v Speaker 4>and things along those lines,</v>

414
00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:07.730
<v Speaker 4>but I mean the stop and frisks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've read something about stop and Frisk</v>

415
00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:12.730
<v Speaker 4>in New York when they had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they had that instituted that most </v>

416
00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:13.130
<v Speaker 4>of it was drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most of it was like catching people with</v>

417
00:20:13.131 --> 00:20:13.610
<v Speaker 4>marijuana.</v>

418
00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:14.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

419
00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:18.210
<v Speaker 4>Which is just fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just stay.</v>

420
00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:21.130
<v Speaker 4>You look like you might be street.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Get over here</v>

421
00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:24.540
<v Speaker 3>and that's the way these laws have </v>
<v Speaker 3>functioned from the very beginning.</v>

422
00:20:24.541 --> 00:20:26.790
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look at drug law in the UK,</v>

423
00:20:26.791 --> 00:20:31.020
<v Speaker 3>it tends to be very black and white.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something is legal or illegal.</v>

424
00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:36.080
<v Speaker 3>If it's legal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can be sold in stores because it's </v>

425
00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:36.080
<v Speaker 3>legal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it's illegal,</v>

426
00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:40.850
<v Speaker 3>it can't be sold anywhere in the US.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've instead created this nebulous </v>

427
00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:45.590
<v Speaker 3>far reaching gray area where there's all</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorts of things that are maybe illegal,</v>

428
00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:46.670
<v Speaker 3>kind of illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do it,</v>

429
00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:51.680
<v Speaker 3>but don't get caught and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's created and ability for the </v>

430
00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:54.440
<v Speaker 3>government to selectively prosecuted </v>
<v Speaker 3>people whenever they want,</v>

431
00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:56.340
<v Speaker 3>if they want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mm.</v>

432
00:20:56.450 --> 00:21:00.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that seems to be lessening.</v>

433
00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:03.690
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you have someone like Jeff sessions</v>

434
00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:06.030
<v Speaker 4>in office,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very disturbing,</v>

435
00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:11.510
<v Speaker 4>but then trump says things like he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>very strong on states rights to past </v>

436
00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:14.460
<v Speaker 4>marijuana laws and things along those </v>
<v Speaker 4>lines.</v>

437
00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:17.270
<v Speaker 3>You're very incredulous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

438
00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:18.200
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

439
00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:21.240
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I suppose I am a bit incredulous when it</v>

440
00:21:21.241 --> 00:21:23.570
<v Speaker 3>comes to trump doing anything good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

441
00:21:23.571 --> 00:21:26.100
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think if you told him that people love</v>

442
00:21:26.101 --> 00:21:27.540
<v Speaker 3>him more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if he did things good,</v>

443
00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:30.590
<v Speaker 3>he would do things good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's probably true.</v>

444
00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:32.560
<v Speaker 3>I think of someone that he trusted said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

445
00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:34.910
<v Speaker 3>I think that's as I think we've got to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get somebody in deep.</v>

446
00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:39.970
<v Speaker 3>We've got to get them all in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got To get somebody who's good at back </v>

447
00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:42.541
<v Speaker 3>rubs get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gets back on the podcast and I think </v>

448
00:21:42.541 --> 00:21:44.820
<v Speaker 3>that'll help.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I doubt it will help.</v>

449
00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:45.880
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just,</v>

450
00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:48.190
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is the thing that'll help.</v>

451
00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:52.840
<v Speaker 4>There's also the separation between the </v>
<v Speaker 4>drug users and the policymakers.</v>

452
00:21:53.530 --> 00:21:58.530
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and one thing that I am certain will </v>

453
00:21:58.530 --> 00:21:58.530
<v Speaker 3>help,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's sort of tragic that this is the</v>

454
00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:00.040
<v Speaker 3>case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's capitalism.</v>

455
00:22:00.041 --> 00:22:04.450
<v Speaker 3>It's the corporatization of these drugs </v>
<v Speaker 3>because with cannabis,</v>

456
00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:05.380
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

457
00:22:05.381 --> 00:22:10.381
<v Speaker 3>when it was hippies and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>counterculture having marches down the </v>

458
00:22:10.391 --> 00:22:13.390
<v Speaker 3>streets of New York holding up for 20 </v>
<v Speaker 3>signs,</v>

459
00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:18.600
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I suppose have all that much clout in </v>

460
00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:22.381
<v Speaker 3>the eyes of lawmakers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you have some guy from Yale </v>

461
00:22:22.381 --> 00:22:23.920
<v Speaker 3>business school who's never smoked weed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who says,</v>

462
00:22:23.921 --> 00:22:26.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a serious business opportunity,</v>

463
00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:28.690
<v Speaker 3>we're going to make it big and gets </v>
<v Speaker 3>investors,</v>

464
00:22:28.691 --> 00:22:31.630
<v Speaker 3>invest millions and millions of dollars </v>
<v Speaker 3>into it.</v>

465
00:22:31.631 --> 00:22:35.320
<v Speaker 3>Hires lobbyists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>plays the game like a capitalist.</v>

466
00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:38.950
<v Speaker 3>Then the laws do change and I wish that </v>
<v Speaker 3>weren't the case,</v>

467
00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:43.980
<v Speaker 3>but it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's tragic for the people that did </v>

468
00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:45.070
<v Speaker 3>fight and did go to prison and did </v>
<v Speaker 3>sacrifice that.</v>

469
00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:50.520
<v Speaker 3>Then these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these business school guys come along </v>

470
00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:52.980
<v Speaker 3>and reap all the benefits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's the way it works.</v>

471
00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:54.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is the way it is</v>

472
00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:57.340
<v Speaker 4>and that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's just a weird path.</v>

473
00:22:57.370 --> 00:23:02.370
<v Speaker 4>It's a weird path,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but as long as we can get to </v>

474
00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:02.370
<v Speaker 4>legalization,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm 100 percent for that path.</v>

475
00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:06.910
<v Speaker 4>I just think that might be the only way </v>
<v Speaker 4>in this weird country,</v>

476
00:23:06.911 --> 00:23:09.690
<v Speaker 4>this country is so enamored with money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean we're,</v>

477
00:23:09.691 --> 00:23:13.030
<v Speaker 4>we're so enamored with money and profits</v>
<v Speaker 4>and even for dying people,</v>

478
00:23:13.031 --> 00:23:16.720
<v Speaker 4>even old people like Warren Buffet </v>
<v Speaker 4>invested shit.</v>

479
00:23:16.721 --> 00:23:21.721
<v Speaker 4>Tons of money in warehouses to sell to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to grow cannabis in Colorado when the </v>

480
00:23:21.881 --> 00:23:24.940
<v Speaker 4>laws were passed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that guy has 150,000</v>

481
00:23:24.941 --> 00:23:29.941
<v Speaker 4>years old.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's worth billions of dollars and he's </v>

482
00:23:29.941 --> 00:23:29.941
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who gives a shit?</v>

483
00:23:29.941 --> 00:23:31.780
<v Speaker 4>I'm making more money now and more and </v>
<v Speaker 4>more and more.</v>

484
00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:37.140
<v Speaker 4>I mean even when they're really old,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're massively motivated by profit.</v>

485
00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:42.940
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think the same will be true for </v>

486
00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:43.570
<v Speaker 3>psychedelics and we'll probably be true </v>
<v Speaker 3>for all of these things because you need</v>

487
00:23:43.571 --> 00:23:48.571
<v Speaker 3>to have lobbyists need to have this sort</v>
<v Speaker 3>of typical white collar support to push </v>

488
00:23:49.491 --> 00:23:50.360
<v Speaker 3>things forward.</v>

489
00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:52.080
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

490
00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:54.490
<v Speaker 2>I don't see any other way around it </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

491
00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:58.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the real hope is that cannabis,</v>

492
00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:03.100
<v Speaker 2>not that it will get rid of capitalism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that we'll figure it out.</v>

493
00:24:03.101 --> 00:24:05.080
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to wear those things with </v>
<v Speaker 2>glasses on,</v>

494
00:24:05.081 --> 00:24:05.980
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

495
00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:11.220
<v Speaker 2>They are always talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The glasses digging your head that </v>

496
00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:18.170
<v Speaker 2>cannabis will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>W did not just cannabis,</v>

497
00:24:18.171 --> 00:24:23.171
<v Speaker 2>but Campbell's will open the door to all</v>
<v Speaker 2>these different substances that will </v>

498
00:24:23.171 --> 00:24:24.110
<v Speaker 2>allow people to have to gain a greater </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective.</v>

499
00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:26.270
<v Speaker 2>This is the ultimate goal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion,</v>

500
00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:31.630
<v Speaker 2>is to give people the opportunity to </v>
<v Speaker 2>step outside of the momentum of their </v>

501
00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:33.560
<v Speaker 2>lives and look at things with fresh eyes</v>
<v Speaker 2>and make clear decisions.</v>

502
00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:38.830
<v Speaker 2>This is one of the best things that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think that drugs provide is that these </v>

503
00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:43.361
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic drugs in particular provide </v>
<v Speaker 2>an escape from the momentum of this life</v>

504
00:24:43.701 --> 00:24:46.220
<v Speaker 2>that you've created or that you found </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself a part of.</v>

505
00:24:46.221 --> 00:24:51.221
<v Speaker 2>It's very difficult for people to stop </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior patterns to stop and just look </v>

506
00:24:51.221 --> 00:24:53.360
<v Speaker 2>at themselves objectively and sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>rethink,</v>

507
00:24:53.361 --> 00:24:58.361
<v Speaker 2>regroup and reassess and this is one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the best things about cannabis and about</v>

508
00:24:59.031 --> 00:25:04.031
<v Speaker 2>suicide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in a lot of these other psychedelic </v>

509
00:25:04.031 --> 00:25:06.341
<v Speaker 2>drugs is that it gives you this newfound</v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective that allows you to </v>

510
00:25:06.341 --> 00:25:06.470
<v Speaker 2>reconsider things.</v>

511
00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:08.200
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

512
00:25:08.201 --> 00:25:11.710
<v Speaker 3>And I think with Ketamine in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>treatment of depression,</v>

513
00:25:11.711 --> 00:25:16.711
<v Speaker 3>it's a similar idea because depressed </v>
<v Speaker 3>people become used to these very </v>

514
00:25:16.961 --> 00:25:21.730
<v Speaker 3>ingrained patterns of thinking and </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything that can break you out of that,</v>

515
00:25:21.731 --> 00:25:25.570
<v Speaker 3>that can shake it up for a minute and </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe give you a different perspective I</v>

516
00:25:25.571 --> 00:25:28.270
<v Speaker 3>think is inherently therapeutic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

517
00:25:28.271 --> 00:25:29.740
<v Speaker 3>I think so as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think</v>

518
00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:35.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm hoping that what I see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is what I believe I see,</v>

519
00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:38.380
<v Speaker 2>is that we're changing our perceptions </v>
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>

520
00:25:38.381 --> 00:25:43.381
<v Speaker 2>I had a conversation with a friend of </v>
<v Speaker 2>mine the other day about marijuana </v>

521
00:25:43.381 --> 00:25:43.700
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

522
00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:45.450
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

523
00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:51.180
<v Speaker 2>how you used to hide whether or not you </v>
<v Speaker 2>did it from certain people and now that </v>

524
00:25:51.531 --> 00:25:56.531
<v Speaker 2>group of people that you have to hide it</v>
<v Speaker 2>from a smaller and smaller and that it </v>

525
00:25:56.531 --> 00:26:00.250
<v Speaker 2>seems like everyone casually smokes </v>
<v Speaker 2>marijuana now in,</v>

526
00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:02.390
<v Speaker 2>in our circles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so many people that do.</v>

527
00:26:02.391 --> 00:26:04.400
<v Speaker 2>There's a few that don't sober people in</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

528
00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:07.610
<v Speaker 2>but it's way more common.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas 10,</v>

529
00:26:07.611 --> 00:26:12.611
<v Speaker 2>15 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was something you hid if you had a </v>

530
00:26:12.611 --> 00:26:12.611
<v Speaker 2>good job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you had a family.</v>

531
00:26:12.611 --> 00:26:13.640
<v Speaker 2>This is not something you want people to</v>
<v Speaker 2>know about</v>

532
00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:19.220
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I think is really interesting is </v>

533
00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:19.920
<v Speaker 3>that in and of itself changes the nature</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the cannabis experience.</v>

534
00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:23.430
<v Speaker 3>So I think if somebody uses cannabis in </v>
<v Speaker 3>a culture that supports it,</v>

535
00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:28.490
<v Speaker 3>that approves of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their experience will be better by </v>

536
00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:31.860
<v Speaker 3>virtue of that fact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's a certain shame that a lot of</v>

537
00:26:31.861 --> 00:26:35.390
<v Speaker 3>people feel when using any drug I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for whatever crazy reason,</v>

538
00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:40.400
<v Speaker 3>feel it a little bit with cannabis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a little just a hair of I should </v>

539
00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:40.400
<v Speaker 3>be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

540
00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:41.610
<v Speaker 3>I should be studying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>should be reading.</v>

541
00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:45.480
<v Speaker 3>They should be you more focused.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a little hedonistic.</v>

542
00:26:45.481 --> 00:26:49.230
<v Speaker 3>It's little comfort oriented.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should be working harder,</v>

543
00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:54.320
<v Speaker 3>but that's I think just the vestiges of </v>
<v Speaker 3>this propaganda that I've been fed or </v>

544
00:26:55.921 --> 00:26:57.510
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or maybe it's true,</v>

545
00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:02.100
<v Speaker 3>but I understand from one perspective </v>
<v Speaker 3>why the cannabis culture,</v>

546
00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:05.470
<v Speaker 3>drums,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the benefits of cannabis so hard.</v>

547
00:27:05.650 --> 00:27:07.810
<v Speaker 3>You know that it cures all disease,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's good for you,</v>

548
00:27:07.811 --> 00:27:09.160
<v Speaker 3>that it cures cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all this stuff.</v>

549
00:27:09.161 --> 00:27:12.100
<v Speaker 3>Because if you have that in your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the very least,</v>

550
00:27:12.101 --> 00:27:17.101
<v Speaker 3>it's going to reduce that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>internal shame that you might feel it </v>

551
00:27:17.101 --> 00:27:20.191
<v Speaker 3>makes the entire experience healthier </v>
<v Speaker 3>and more beneficial because we do </v>

552
00:27:20.191 --> 00:27:23.371
<v Speaker 3>construct these limitations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We construct these experiences to some </v>

553
00:27:23.371 --> 00:27:26.371
<v Speaker 3>extent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you decide that cannabis is a </v>

554
00:27:26.371 --> 00:27:28.981
<v Speaker 3>dissociative drug that's hedonistic and </v>
<v Speaker 3>comfort oriented and will take you away </v>

555
00:27:28.981 --> 00:27:31.450
<v Speaker 3>from your responsibilities and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>what it will become,</v>

556
00:27:31.451 --> 00:27:33.520
<v Speaker 3>but if you decide like Terence Mckenna </v>
<v Speaker 3>did,</v>

557
00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:38.610
<v Speaker 3>that it's an intellectual catalyst that </v>
<v Speaker 3>it will facilitate your ability to read </v>

558
00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:41.200
<v Speaker 3>and learn and think and write,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it will become that as well.</v>

559
00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:42.680
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

560
00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:44.090
<v Speaker 4>it's a weird one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

561
00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:47.390
<v Speaker 4>Because people that are people that take</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

562
00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:52.420
<v Speaker 4>that are prone to paranoia or that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>dealing with some difficult issues in </v>

563
00:27:52.551 --> 00:27:54.980
<v Speaker 4>their life right now that they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>perhaps trying to avoid,</v>

564
00:27:55.370 --> 00:28:00.370
<v Speaker 4>it becomes an uncomfortable experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas people that are happy and having</v>

565
00:28:01.251 --> 00:28:05.420
<v Speaker 4>a good time and in a good place,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the marijuana will sort of enhance that.</v>

566
00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:08.130
<v Speaker 4>He was loving,</v>
<v Speaker 4>warm feeling of,</v>

567
00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:13.320
<v Speaker 4>of comfort and have like sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>acceptance of your existence and it's </v>

568
00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:13.640
<v Speaker 4>going to be okay.</v>

569
00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:19.680
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think even the paranoia is like a </v>

570
00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:21.260
<v Speaker 3>sort of sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

571
00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:26.030
<v Speaker 3>meme you could say a sort of vestige of </v>
<v Speaker 3>this propaganda that makes people afraid</v>

572
00:28:26.031 --> 00:28:31.031
<v Speaker 3>in the same vein as the bad trip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the concept of a bad trip is a </v>

573
00:28:31.031 --> 00:28:34.130
<v Speaker 3>very damaging concept because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I know from personal experience,</v>

574
00:28:34.131 --> 00:28:38.030
<v Speaker 3>I never really used psychedelics in high</v>
<v Speaker 3>school with the exception of Salvia,</v>

575
00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:40.610
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I was terrified of a bad trip.</v>

576
00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:44.150
<v Speaker 3>Talk to friends who'd described bad </v>
<v Speaker 3>trips and they say,</v>

577
00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:45.230
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's bad.</v>

578
00:28:45.231 --> 00:28:47.720
<v Speaker 3>It's bad trip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really bad.</v>

579
00:28:47.721 --> 00:28:49.130
<v Speaker 3>It's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I would think,</v>

580
00:28:49.131 --> 00:28:50.000
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's terrible.</v>

581
00:28:50.001 --> 00:28:51.830
<v Speaker 3>I could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would never want a bad trip.</v>

582
00:28:51.831 --> 00:28:55.100
<v Speaker 3>I'm never going to touch these things </v>
<v Speaker 3>because a bad trip would be too much for</v>

583
00:28:55.101 --> 00:29:00.101
<v Speaker 3>me to tolerate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I started using psychedelics </v>

584
00:29:00.101 --> 00:29:02.861
<v Speaker 3>and I realized there's no such thing as </v>
<v Speaker 3>a bad trip anymore than there's a bad </v>

585
00:29:02.861 --> 00:29:04.550
<v Speaker 3>meal or a bad relationship or a bad day.</v>

586
00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:09.730
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>having an occasional bad thing in life </v>

587
00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:11.210
<v Speaker 3>doesn't stop you from doing things like </v>
<v Speaker 3>eating or having relationships or living</v>

588
00:29:11.211 --> 00:29:14.010
<v Speaker 3>typically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what do you mean by this?</v>

589
00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:19.630
<v Speaker 3>Are you saying there's no such thing as </v>
<v Speaker 3>a bad trip saying there's no such thing </v>

590
00:29:19.630 --> 00:29:22.110
<v Speaker 3>as a bad meal?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying that there is such thing as a</v>

591
00:29:22.111 --> 00:29:27.111
<v Speaker 3>bad meal but.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it wouldn't prevent you from </v>

592
00:29:27.111 --> 00:29:29.931
<v Speaker 3>tripping.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that even the bad or </v>

593
00:29:29.931 --> 00:29:29.931
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't prevent you from eating rather </v>
<v Speaker 3>sorry about that,</v>

594
00:29:29.931 --> 00:29:31.200
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think even these bad trips,</v>

595
00:29:31.201 --> 00:29:36.201
<v Speaker 3>although they can be difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are beneficial and our learning </v>

596
00:29:36.201 --> 00:29:36.201
<v Speaker 3>experience in the same way that a bad </v>
<v Speaker 3>meal could be.</v>

597
00:29:36.201 --> 00:29:41.091
<v Speaker 3>You learned not to go to that restaurant</v>
<v Speaker 3>or maybe you learned something about </v>

598
00:29:41.091 --> 00:29:41.091
<v Speaker 3>what makes you sick or what to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>careful of in the future.</v>

599
00:29:41.091 --> 00:29:45.830
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you are approaching life from a non </v>

600
00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:46.420
<v Speaker 3>fearful perspective where your intention</v>
<v Speaker 3>is to learn,</v>

601
00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:51.570
<v Speaker 3>then you can extract benefit from almost</v>
<v Speaker 3>any experience and these difficult </v>

602
00:29:52.481 --> 00:29:53.470
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic experiences.</v>

603
00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:58.470
<v Speaker 3>I genuinely believe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is what is maybe the hardest </v>

604
00:29:58.470 --> 00:29:59.470
<v Speaker 3>thing to communicate about psychedelics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that it's the difficult ones that are</v>

605
00:29:59.471 --> 00:30:03.610
<v Speaker 3>often the best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are the ones that really teach you</v>

606
00:30:03.611 --> 00:30:08.611
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you're trying to talk about </v>

607
00:30:08.611 --> 00:30:08.611
<v Speaker 3>psychedelics with people who've never </v>
<v Speaker 3>used them,</v>

608
00:30:08.611 --> 00:30:09.990
<v Speaker 3>it's not a great selling point to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

609
00:30:09.991 --> 00:30:11.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the best thing that can happen is you're</v>

610
00:30:11.591 --> 00:30:16.591
<v Speaker 3>going to think you're going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that is arguably the best thing that</v>

611
00:30:17.161 --> 00:30:22.161
<v Speaker 3>can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To think that you're going to die </v>

612
00:30:22.161 --> 00:30:22.830
<v Speaker 3>because that's a confrontation with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>overarching fear,</v>

613
00:30:22.831 --> 00:30:26.160
<v Speaker 3>the fear of that generates all other </v>
<v Speaker 3>fears and if you conquer that fear,</v>

614
00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:26.910
<v Speaker 3>then</v>

615
00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:29.420
<v Speaker 4>your life will almost certainly </v>
<v Speaker 4>improved.</v>

616
00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:34.450
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is one thing that's sort of </v>

617
00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:36.521
<v Speaker 4>genuine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>genuinely universally accepted as a </v>

618
00:30:36.521 --> 00:30:38.060
<v Speaker 4>beneficial experience is a near death </v>
<v Speaker 4>experience,</v>

619
00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:42.290
<v Speaker 4>sort of universally accepted as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>transformative moment in people's lives.</v>

620
00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:44.510
<v Speaker 4>Like I had this near death experience </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I realized,</v>

621
00:30:44.511 --> 00:30:46.340
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I gotta get my shit together.</v>

622
00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:51.490
<v Speaker 4>After that heart attack,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I realized that life is a gift and I </v>

623
00:30:51.490 --> 00:30:54.911
<v Speaker 4>changed the way I think about things and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I started calling people that I loved </v>

624
00:30:54.911 --> 00:30:55.660
<v Speaker 4>and telling them that I loved them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is the same.</v>

625
00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:57.640
<v Speaker 4>You can get a near death experience from</v>
<v Speaker 4>cannabis.</v>

626
00:30:57.641 --> 00:31:01.270
<v Speaker 4>You just don't ever tie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you really do.</v>

627
00:31:01.510 --> 00:31:06.510
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the death of so many perceptions </v>

628
00:31:06.510 --> 00:31:07.540
<v Speaker 4>and so many things about your life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially from edible cannabis,</v>

629
00:31:07.541 --> 00:31:12.541
<v Speaker 4>which I think is probably one of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>least understood and most potent things </v>

630
00:31:12.971 --> 00:31:15.070
<v Speaker 4>that people are consuming on a daily </v>
<v Speaker 4>basis.</v>

631
00:31:15.071 --> 00:31:20.071
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't tell you how many times I've </v>

632
00:31:20.071 --> 00:31:22.781
<v Speaker 4>given someone edible marijuana in their </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking convinced that it's been laced </v>

633
00:31:22.781 --> 00:31:24.650
<v Speaker 4>with something awful and that they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to die,</v>

634
00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:27.320
<v Speaker 4>but then afterwards they come out of it </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they're like,</v>

635
00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:29.870
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I got some work to do.</v>

636
00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:36.640
<v Speaker 4>The only way I would disagree with you </v>
<v Speaker 4>is people that are prone to psychotic </v>

637
00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:41.411
<v Speaker 4>breaks because that there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is an absolute genuine connection </v>

638
00:31:41.411 --> 00:31:46.360
<v Speaker 4>between people who have a slippery hold </v>
<v Speaker 4>on reality and some experiences with </v>

639
00:31:47.781 --> 00:31:50.210
<v Speaker 4>psychedelics that lead them down a bad </v>
<v Speaker 4>road.</v>

640
00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:52.850
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can.</v>

641
00:31:52.851 --> 00:31:57.810
<v Speaker 3>It's a stressor and like all stressors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can precipitate a psychotic break.</v>

642
00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:02.960
<v Speaker 3>A,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've done pretty large scale </v>

643
00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:05.281
<v Speaker 3>epidemiological analyses of psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 3>drug users versus the non psychedelic </v>

644
00:32:05.281 --> 00:32:08.740
<v Speaker 3>drug using population and the incidence </v>
<v Speaker 3>of mental illness isn't any higher.</v>

645
00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:12.700
<v Speaker 3>So I don't think you can argue that </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychedelics cause mental illness,</v>

646
00:32:12.701 --> 00:32:17.701
<v Speaker 3>but you can add it in some measures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems to actually reduce it in terms </v>

647
00:32:17.701 --> 00:32:19.720
<v Speaker 3>of things like alcoholism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>substance abuse disorders.</v>

648
00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:20.790
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

649
00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:27.120
<v Speaker 3>but it can be a stressor that would </v>
<v Speaker 3>precipitate such an episode in a </v>

650
00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:29.700
<v Speaker 3>susceptible individual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I had a very traumatic and formative</v>

651
00:32:29.701 --> 00:32:34.701
<v Speaker 3>experience myself for my best friend had</v>
<v Speaker 3>a psychotic break while I was with him </v>

652
00:32:34.701 --> 00:32:36.090
<v Speaker 3>tripping.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I've seen this firsthand.</v>

653
00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:38.280
<v Speaker 3>I know exactly what it looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

654
00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:39.270
<v Speaker 3>I've had friends.</v>

655
00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:40.150
<v Speaker 4>I have real</v>

656
00:32:40.150 --> 00:32:45.150
<v Speaker 3>bad experiences too where they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>screaming and yelling and then </v>

657
00:32:45.150 --> 00:32:48.830
<v Speaker 3>disassociative and then afterwards </v>
<v Speaker 3>become very strange and have a really </v>

658
00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:50.670
<v Speaker 3>hard time with reality for a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

659
00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:55.710
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen someone have a complete </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychotic break promise that he never </v>

660
00:32:55.710 --> 00:32:55.710
<v Speaker 3>recovered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He never,</v>

661
00:32:55.710 --> 00:32:58.210
<v Speaker 3>he never recovered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was my best friend at the time and he</v>

662
00:32:58.211 --> 00:33:00.760
<v Speaker 3>never recovered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he was fine before the psychedelic.</v>

663
00:33:00.790 --> 00:33:03.040
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ light again.</v>

664
00:33:03.041 --> 00:33:03.540
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>

665
00:33:03.670 --> 00:33:06.580
<v Speaker 3>And that happened early.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now he's still fucked.</v>

666
00:33:07.150 --> 00:33:09.430
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But again,</v>

667
00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:10.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

668
00:33:10.611 --> 00:33:15.611
<v Speaker 3>I typically don't tell that story in </v>
<v Speaker 3>public because it's could be </v>

669
00:33:15.611 --> 00:33:18.220
<v Speaker 3>misinterpreted as a scare story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

670
00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:23.310
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's impossible to prove the </v>

671
00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:25.261
<v Speaker 3>counterfactual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would it have happened without </v>

672
00:33:25.261 --> 00:33:25.261
<v Speaker 3>psychedelics?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Almost certainly.</v>

673
00:33:25.261 --> 00:33:29.220
<v Speaker 3>I can't say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All I know is that he took a very high </v>

674
00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:32.911
<v Speaker 3>dose of a Silicon Ester and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had this episode,</v>

675
00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:37.660
<v Speaker 3>he was hospitalized and he was not the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same afterwards.</v>

676
00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:41.620
<v Speaker 3>So I'm aware that this is something that</v>
<v Speaker 3>happens,</v>

677
00:33:41.621 --> 00:33:44.110
<v Speaker 3>but it also typically happens in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>early twenties,</v>

678
00:33:44.410 --> 00:33:47.350
<v Speaker 3>late teens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same time that people typically have</v>

679
00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:49.960
<v Speaker 3>psychotic breaks and develop </v>
<v Speaker 3>schizophrenia.</v>

680
00:33:50.650 --> 00:33:51.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The incident.</v>

681
00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:56.480
<v Speaker 4>This is of schizophrenia in people who </v>
<v Speaker 4>use cannabis are a cannabis in </v>

682
00:33:56.480 --> 00:34:01.251
<v Speaker 4>particular,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't know about other </v>

683
00:34:01.251 --> 00:34:02.871
<v Speaker 4>psychedelics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I would imagine they're very </v>

684
00:34:02.871 --> 00:34:04.371
<v Speaker 4>similar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're exactly the same as the </v>

685
00:34:04.371 --> 00:34:05.760
<v Speaker 4>incidences of schizophrenia and non </v>
<v Speaker 4>using populations.</v>

686
00:34:05.761 --> 00:34:10.761
<v Speaker 4>It's like one percent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one percent across the board seemed to </v>

687
00:34:10.761 --> 00:34:14.091
<v Speaker 4>have issues with schizophrenia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the real question is how many of </v>

688
00:34:14.561 --> 00:34:19.561
<v Speaker 4>those people could mean isn't avoidable </v>
<v Speaker 4>if your friend had never done that and </v>

689
00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:25.730
<v Speaker 4>instead had become a marathon runner or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something and know,</v>

690
00:34:25.910 --> 00:34:30.360
<v Speaker 4>found some other outlets for his energy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>would he have never gone down that road?</v>

691
00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:31.830
<v Speaker 4>We don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's impossible.</v>

692
00:34:31.831 --> 00:34:36.831
<v Speaker 4>It's impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I think it's very important to talk </v>

693
00:34:36.831 --> 00:34:38.100
<v Speaker 4>about that though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And with further research,</v>

694
00:34:38.101 --> 00:34:43.101
<v Speaker 4>perhaps we could isolate jeans they have</v>
<v Speaker 4>for cte now they have,</v>

695
00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:49.160
<v Speaker 4>they can do an analysis of your genes </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then determine whether or not </v>

696
00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:53.541
<v Speaker 4>something like football and be a </v>
<v Speaker 4>dangerous path for you because you have </v>

697
00:34:53.541 --> 00:34:57.380
<v Speaker 4>a higher probability of developing cte.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would be wonderful if they figured </v>

698
00:34:57.661 --> 00:35:02.661
<v Speaker 4>out a way to do that with psilocybin or </v>
<v Speaker 4>with cannabis or with anything else and </v>

699
00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:07.700
<v Speaker 4>be able to recognize the potential links</v>
<v Speaker 4>to psychotic breaks and to,</v>

700
00:35:08.330 --> 00:35:13.330
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a host of different mental disorders </v>

701
00:35:13.330 --> 00:35:13.330
<v Speaker 4>that could possibly be triggered by high</v>
<v Speaker 4>doses.</v>

702
00:35:13.610 --> 00:35:18.610
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is one of so many things </v>

703
00:35:18.610 --> 00:35:19.180
<v Speaker 3>that needs to be done and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

704
00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:24.280
<v Speaker 3>everyone's very excited about all of </v>
<v Speaker 3>this clinical research that's happening </v>

705
00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:24.280
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm excited about it as well.</v>

706
00:35:24.290 --> 00:35:28.790
<v Speaker 3>But on one level it is very politically </v>
<v Speaker 3>oriented research,</v>

707
00:35:28.791 --> 00:35:33.791
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the things that they're looking at have </v>

708
00:35:33.791 --> 00:35:33.920
<v Speaker 3>actually typically been done before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not all of it,</v>

709
00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:39.100
<v Speaker 3>but the aim is to firmly establish these</v>
<v Speaker 3>things that have been known for a long </v>

710
00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:40.920
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Silicide been occasions,</v>

711
00:35:40.921 --> 00:35:45.921
<v Speaker 3>mystical type experience or Mtma is </v>
<v Speaker 3>useful for treating ptsd or psilocybin </v>

712
00:35:46.891 --> 00:35:51.891
<v Speaker 3>has an anti addictive effect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are things that people have known </v>

713
00:35:51.891 --> 00:35:53.520
<v Speaker 3>for a little while,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now it's about proving it,</v>

714
00:35:53.521 --> 00:35:58.521
<v Speaker 3>but I'm really looking forward to </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting deeper into these serious </v>

715
00:35:58.521 --> 00:36:02.691
<v Speaker 3>questions about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know exactly how these drugs </v>

716
00:36:02.691 --> 00:36:06.180
<v Speaker 3>interact with various subtypes of </v>
<v Speaker 3>serotonin receptors because I think that</v>

717
00:36:06.181 --> 00:36:11.181
<v Speaker 3>they're going to be very important tools</v>
<v Speaker 3>for understanding consciousness as a </v>

718
00:36:11.181 --> 00:36:11.181
<v Speaker 3>whole.</v>

719
00:36:11.570 --> 00:36:13.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would also be interesting knowing how</v>

720
00:36:13.761 --> 00:36:16.490
<v Speaker 2>they react to different diets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

721
00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:20.290
<v Speaker 2>when people are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

722
00:36:20.291 --> 00:36:23.950
<v Speaker 2>when you're eating certain types of </v>
<v Speaker 2>foods that are bad for your body,</v>

723
00:36:24.170 --> 00:36:27.070
<v Speaker 2>I would really be curious to see what </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of effect that has.</v>

724
00:36:27.071 --> 00:36:32.071
<v Speaker 2>I mean when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you have real large scale research </v>

725
00:36:32.071 --> 00:36:35.431
<v Speaker 2>that goes over really important </v>
<v Speaker 2>variables in terms of human health and </v>

726
00:36:36.521 --> 00:36:40.240
<v Speaker 2>then you add in these different </v>
<v Speaker 2>substances,</v>

727
00:36:40.241 --> 00:36:43.390
<v Speaker 2>whether it's silicide or cannabis or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is.</v>

728
00:36:43.690 --> 00:36:46.060
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's gonna be interesting to see how the</v>

729
00:36:46.061 --> 00:36:50.200
<v Speaker 2>body reacts to these various </v>
<v Speaker 2>preturbances,</v>

730
00:36:50.201 --> 00:36:52.000
<v Speaker 2>these various changes of your state.</v>

731
00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:53.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's,</v>

732
00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:58.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>traditionally in a lot of these </v>

733
00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:00.610
<v Speaker 3>indigenous groups,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Diet plays a big role in the way </v>

734
00:37:00.610 --> 00:37:03.821
<v Speaker 3>that the drug is administered and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think we're slowly rediscovering a lot </v>

735
00:37:03.821 --> 00:37:06.970
<v Speaker 3>of things that have been known for tens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe hundreds,</v>

736
00:37:06.971 --> 00:37:10.270
<v Speaker 3>maybe thousands of years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and some of these indigenous groups.</v>

737
00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:13.600
<v Speaker 3>Have you had a chance to see any of my </v>
<v Speaker 3>new show?</v>

738
00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:14.410
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

739
00:37:14.411 --> 00:37:15.070
<v Speaker 3>I haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

740
00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:17.280
<v Speaker 3>I think you'd like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure I'd liked it.</v>

741
00:37:17.290 --> 00:37:18.760
<v Speaker 3>I liked her old show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>

742
00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:20.800
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a lot better than the old </v>
<v Speaker 3>show.</v>

743
00:37:20.830 --> 00:37:21.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Awesome.</v>

744
00:37:21.850 --> 00:37:22.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>

745
00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:25.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had the opportunity to look at the way</v>

746
00:37:25.511 --> 00:37:30.370
<v Speaker 3>Salvia is used in the mountains of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Wahaca and you know,</v>

747
00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:34.300
<v Speaker 3>native American peyote use and all these</v>
<v Speaker 3>different things and yeah,</v>

748
00:37:34.301 --> 00:37:39.301
<v Speaker 3>there's so much to be learned from all </v>
<v Speaker 3>of these traditions that are not </v>

749
00:37:39.301 --> 00:37:42.800
<v Speaker 3>reflected in the current clinical </v>
<v Speaker 3>climate because they can't be.</v>

750
00:37:42.830 --> 00:37:47.830
<v Speaker 3>But I think that that's going to be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>part of it is slowly integrating these </v>

751
00:37:47.830 --> 00:37:49.430
<v Speaker 3>other alkaloids that are present in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>plants to see what role they play in the</v>

752
00:37:49.431 --> 00:37:50.510
<v Speaker 3>same way that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

753
00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:53.840
<v Speaker 3>the initial medicalization of cannabis </v>
<v Speaker 3>was Marinol,</v>

754
00:37:53.841 --> 00:37:58.841
<v Speaker 3>which is just phc and sesame oil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now there's increased understanding </v>

755
00:37:58.841 --> 00:38:03.181
<v Speaker 3>of the way these accessory cannabinoids </v>
<v Speaker 3>modulate the thc experience or whether </v>

756
00:38:03.181 --> 00:38:07.020
<v Speaker 3>thc is even the primary therapeutic </v>
<v Speaker 3>agent for certain disorders.</v>

757
00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:12.320
<v Speaker 3>And I imagine the same thing will be </v>
<v Speaker 3>true for Peo Odi and for the Iboga </v>

758
00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:16.020
<v Speaker 3>alkaloids and probably even for some of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the chemicals found in mushrooms.</v>

759
00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:21.780
<v Speaker 2>So when you're doing this show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you had any problems?</v>

760
00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:24.050
<v Speaker 2>Have you had any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

761
00:38:24.430 --> 00:38:27.470
<v Speaker 2>push back against what you're doing or </v>
<v Speaker 2>any,</v>

762
00:38:27.471 --> 00:38:30.230
<v Speaker 2>any issues with it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Being on vice?</v>

763
00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:34.110
<v Speaker 3>I've had an enormous amount of freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

764
00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:39.160
<v Speaker 3>ultimately I have very little to </v>
<v Speaker 3>complain about when it comes to </v>

765
00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:39.670
<v Speaker 3>censorship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was,</v>

766
00:38:39.671 --> 00:38:41.200
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

767
00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:46.560
<v Speaker 3>the way the show got started,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the actual TV show is sort of an </v>

768
00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:49.381
<v Speaker 3>interesting story where they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>starting up vice land and a producer </v>

769
00:38:49.381 --> 00:38:53.011
<v Speaker 3>who's now gone a gave me this deck of </v>
<v Speaker 3>drug stories they were going to do and </v>

770
00:38:53.011 --> 00:38:57.121
<v Speaker 3>there are all kinds of terrible scare </v>
<v Speaker 3>stories like the new drug Bromo Dragon </v>

771
00:38:57.121 --> 00:39:01.351
<v Speaker 3>flying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's killing teens and new drug Bromo </v>

772
00:39:01.351 --> 00:39:01.351
<v Speaker 3>driving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

773
00:39:01.351 --> 00:39:01.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does that,</v>

774
00:39:02.170 --> 00:39:06.540
<v Speaker 3>it's a really fascinating compound </v>
<v Speaker 3>developed by this chemist David Nichols,</v>

775
00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:07.260
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

776
00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:09.980
<v Speaker 3>found that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that these confirmation,</v>

777
00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:14.990
<v Speaker 3>highly constrained Benzo fear in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>amphetamine derivatives are like very </v>

778
00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:16.780
<v Speaker 3>high potency dob derivatives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

779
00:39:16.781 --> 00:39:21.781
<v Speaker 3>it's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a super potent psychedelic </v>

780
00:39:21.781 --> 00:39:21.781
<v Speaker 3>amphetamine that has a cool tryciclics </v>
<v Speaker 3>structure.</v>

781
00:39:21.930 --> 00:39:24.190
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then it looks like a dragon fly.</v>

782
00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:26.440
<v Speaker 3>The molecule looks like a dragon fly </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of.</v>

783
00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:29.880
<v Speaker 3>And it's got a very high,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

784
00:39:30.050 --> 00:39:32.020
<v Speaker 3>It's super,</v>
<v Speaker 3>super potent and very,</v>

785
00:39:32.021 --> 00:39:35.920
<v Speaker 3>very long lasting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it lent itself to scare stories.</v>

786
00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:37.480
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

787
00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:40.630
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is a potent vasoconstrictor so people</v>

788
00:39:40.631 --> 00:39:43.900
<v Speaker 3>will take very high doses of it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>occasionally they would have to amputate</v>

789
00:39:43.901 --> 00:39:46.720
<v Speaker 3>a finger or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But again,</v>

790
00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:49.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this isn't because the drug is bad,</v>

791
00:39:49.601 --> 00:39:52.360
<v Speaker 3>it's because people used it </v>
<v Speaker 3>irresponsibly and this is something that</v>

792
00:39:52.361 --> 00:39:54.730
<v Speaker 3>people have so much difficulty </v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding.</v>

793
00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:57.910
<v Speaker 3>We're so eager to blame drugs for all of</v>
<v Speaker 3>our problems.</v>

794
00:39:57.911 --> 00:40:02.911
<v Speaker 3>Drugs have never heard anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just inanimate constellations of</v>

795
00:40:03.071 --> 00:40:05.200
<v Speaker 3>carbon and hydrogen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nitrogen and oxygen.</v>

796
00:40:05.201 --> 00:40:10.201
<v Speaker 3>They don't jump out of their bags and </v>
<v Speaker 3>vials and attack your serotonin </v>

797
00:40:10.201 --> 00:40:12.280
<v Speaker 3>receptors for dopamine transport or </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything like that.</v>

798
00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:17.520
<v Speaker 3>So this is just a weird pattern that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we've done repeatedly over time.</v>

799
00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:20.170
<v Speaker 3>And I don't know if you read the new </v>
<v Speaker 3>Michael Paulin book.</v>

800
00:40:20.171 --> 00:40:22.420
<v Speaker 3>I know he was on the podcast I'm in </v>
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>

801
00:40:22.570 --> 00:40:23.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's great.</v>

802
00:40:23.770 --> 00:40:24.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is great.</v>

803
00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:25.720
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

804
00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:30.780
<v Speaker 3>one thing that I thought was interesting</v>
<v Speaker 3>about it is that he put a lot of the </v>

805
00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:35.580
<v Speaker 3>emphasis on the prohibition of </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychedelics on leary and leary almost </v>

806
00:40:36.491 --> 00:40:41.491
<v Speaker 3>certainly played a role,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's slightly ironic that </v>

807
00:40:41.491 --> 00:40:44.230
<v Speaker 3>he's a journalist and didn't really go </v>
<v Speaker 3>that deep into the role that journalists</v>

808
00:40:44.231 --> 00:40:46.360
<v Speaker 3>played in all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was humongous.</v>

809
00:40:46.361 --> 00:40:51.361
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>journalists are sculptors of public </v>

810
00:40:51.361 --> 00:40:53.551
<v Speaker 3>opinion and it became the standard way </v>
<v Speaker 3>of reporting on any of these things to </v>

811
00:40:53.861 --> 00:40:56.920
<v Speaker 3>say that they're bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to sensationalize it and to not have any</v>

812
00:40:56.921 --> 00:41:01.921
<v Speaker 3>consideration for what that would do </v>
<v Speaker 3>because anytime a journalist writes him </v>

813
00:41:01.921 --> 00:41:05.620
<v Speaker 3>scare story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can really mess with drug policy in</v>

814
00:41:05.621 --> 00:41:06.430
<v Speaker 3>a serious way.</v>

815
00:41:06.430 --> 00:41:07.870
<v Speaker 3>It might seem like nothing like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

816
00:41:07.871 --> 00:41:12.871
<v Speaker 3>there's a bunch of people in Brooklyn </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they overdosed on some obscure </v>

817
00:41:12.871 --> 00:41:17.491
<v Speaker 3>synthetic cannabinoid amb food minuka </v>
<v Speaker 3>who cares about amb food Venica no big </v>

818
00:41:17.491 --> 00:41:22.201
<v Speaker 3>deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say that it turns people into zombies </v>

819
00:41:22.201 --> 00:41:22.201
<v Speaker 3>and if it gets thrown into schedule one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who cares?</v>

820
00:41:22.201 --> 00:41:23.440
<v Speaker 3>Not a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

821
00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:28.800
<v Speaker 3>that's a very short sighted way of </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking about all of this because </v>

822
00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:30.910
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly what happened with </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychedelics and then we're not learning</v>

823
00:41:30.911 --> 00:41:35.911
<v Speaker 3>from the mistakes of the past that just </v>
<v Speaker 3>because something it's fun to </v>

824
00:41:35.911 --> 00:41:39.970
<v Speaker 3>sensationalize and talk about how </v>
<v Speaker 3>dangerous it is at this moment doesn't </v>

825
00:41:39.970 --> 00:41:43.721
<v Speaker 3>mean that 10 years from now we're going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to recognize it as serious therapeutic </v>

826
00:41:43.721 --> 00:41:46.961
<v Speaker 3>potential and we made a big mistake </v>
<v Speaker 3>outlawing it and I think a lot of that </v>

827
00:41:46.961 --> 00:41:51.131
<v Speaker 3>also comes from this sort of us versus </v>
<v Speaker 3>them mentality that people have where </v>

828
00:41:51.131 --> 00:41:52.250
<v Speaker 3>it's cannabis is good.</v>

829
00:41:52.310 --> 00:41:57.310
<v Speaker 3>Synthetic cannabinoids are bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well synthetic cannabinoids don't have </v>

830
00:41:57.310 --> 00:42:01.291
<v Speaker 3>to be bad for cannabis to be good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cannabis can be good without something </v>

831
00:42:01.291 --> 00:42:02.080
<v Speaker 3>else being bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To counterbalance that you don't need to</v>

832
00:42:02.081 --> 00:42:07.081
<v Speaker 3>hate something to justify your love of </v>
<v Speaker 3>cannabis and this whole hatred of </v>

833
00:42:07.081 --> 00:42:11.401
<v Speaker 3>synthetic cannabinoids I think is </v>
<v Speaker 3>totally misdirected because these are </v>

834
00:42:11.401 --> 00:42:14.850
<v Speaker 3>products of prohibition that most people</v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't even want to use in the first </v>

835
00:42:14.850 --> 00:42:17.290
<v Speaker 3>place and when they do use them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't know what they're taking.</v>

836
00:42:17.291 --> 00:42:22.291
<v Speaker 3>They don't know what dose they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>consuming and so of course they're </v>

837
00:42:22.291 --> 00:42:22.480
<v Speaker 3>having bad experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would happen with almost any drug,</v>

838
00:42:22.481 --> 00:42:27.481
<v Speaker 3>caffeine included if people just </v>
<v Speaker 3>consumed enormous unmeasured doses </v>

839
00:42:27.481 --> 00:42:32.171
<v Speaker 3>without having any idea what they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting into and so they're thrown into </v>

840
00:42:32.171 --> 00:42:33.620
<v Speaker 3>schedule one or what happens if 30 years</v>
<v Speaker 3>from now,</v>

841
00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:38.740
<v Speaker 3>once the therapeutic potential of </v>
<v Speaker 3>cannabinoids as being really seriously </v>

842
00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:43.031
<v Speaker 3>explored,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we find out that that Ambi Food Venica </v>

843
00:42:43.031 --> 00:42:45.791
<v Speaker 3>that everyone was saying turned homeless</v>
<v Speaker 3>people into zombies in Brooklyn in 2017 </v>

844
00:42:45.791 --> 00:42:49.100
<v Speaker 3>turns out to activate a certain subtype </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the CB one receptor that's especially</v>

845
00:42:49.101 --> 00:42:51.560
<v Speaker 3>useful for Parkinson's disease or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

846
00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:53.900
<v Speaker 3>Then we're going to regret having done </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

847
00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:55.880
<v Speaker 3>So I think people have to be very </v>
<v Speaker 3>careful.</v>

848
00:42:55.881 --> 00:42:57.920
<v Speaker 3>Anytime you say anything negative about </v>
<v Speaker 3>a drug,</v>

849
00:42:57.921 --> 00:43:02.921
<v Speaker 3>you have to be very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very careful because the implications </v>

850
00:43:02.921 --> 00:43:05.351
<v Speaker 3>can be enormous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that the best stance and all of </v>

851
00:43:05.351 --> 00:43:07.750
<v Speaker 3>this is to not speak ill of drug</v>

852
00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:12.580
<v Speaker 2>drug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The drugs are true drug enthusiastic,</v>

853
00:43:12.770 --> 00:43:15.930
<v Speaker 2>but it's not a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also with just what journalism is.</v>

854
00:43:15.931 --> 00:43:19.050
<v Speaker 2>It's like asking a comedian to talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about something but not make fun of it.</v>

855
00:43:19.110 --> 00:43:23.490
<v Speaker 2>That's what their job in a certain sense</v>
<v Speaker 2>is to get people excited about things.</v>

856
00:43:23.970 --> 00:43:28.970
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know whether you'd say the </v>
<v Speaker 2>lazy way out or the common approach is </v>

857
00:43:28.970 --> 00:43:30.790
<v Speaker 2>to say something that scares people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's.</v>

858
00:43:30.791 --> 00:43:34.830
<v Speaker 2>That's what clickbait is mostly about </v>
<v Speaker 2>either outrage or fear.</v>

859
00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:37.680
<v Speaker 2>That's true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a lot of richness in truth.</v>

860
00:43:37.770 --> 00:43:39.660
<v Speaker 2>I agree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's hard to sell.</v>

861
00:43:40.070 --> 00:43:41.820
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to settle that rich and hard </v>
<v Speaker 2>to sell.</v>

862
00:43:41.850 --> 00:43:42.600
<v Speaker 2>I think the people are</v>

863
00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:43.640
<v Speaker 3>lazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

864
00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:46.520
<v Speaker 3>is this idea that a lot of people have </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

865
00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:51.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>journalism is organized by some </v>

866
00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:53.570
<v Speaker 3>malevolent Rupert Murdoch type puppeteer</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's telling everyone to.</v>

867
00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:56.870
<v Speaker 3>You go off and you say that cannabis </v>
<v Speaker 3>causes car accidents.</v>

868
00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:00.890
<v Speaker 3>When you go off and you say this evil </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing about this and say that again.</v>

869
00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:05.890
<v Speaker 2>Alcohol is good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you see when a Alex Jones was on my </v>

870
00:44:05.890 --> 00:44:07.530
<v Speaker 2>podcast and got high with me when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>drunk and I.</v>

871
00:44:07.590 --> 00:44:11.370
<v Speaker 2>and when it came up in his trial for his</v>
<v Speaker 2>divorce,</v>

872
00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:17.150
<v Speaker 2>he said that George Soros puts a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He tests marijuana every year to see how</v>

873
00:44:19.381 --> 00:44:24.381
<v Speaker 2>much George Soros is influencing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>levels of thc was his excuse that people</v>

874
00:44:28.831 --> 00:44:30.900
<v Speaker 2>love these ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They love the ideas of the,</v>

875
00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:32.370
<v Speaker 2>the malevolent</v>

876
00:44:32.370 --> 00:44:35.340
<v Speaker 3>puppeteer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it denies individual agency,</v>

877
00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:40.400
<v Speaker 3>but the reality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I say this as a journalist who's </v>

878
00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:40.400
<v Speaker 3>worked at many different publications,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just vice is,</v>

879
00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:42.660
<v Speaker 3>and this is a difficult reality to </v>
<v Speaker 3>swallow,</v>

880
00:44:42.661 --> 00:44:45.810
<v Speaker 3>is that people are free to say whatever </v>
<v Speaker 3>they want.</v>

881
00:44:45.811 --> 00:44:49.920
<v Speaker 3>Most of the time journalists choose to </v>
<v Speaker 3>report on things this way.</v>

882
00:44:50.530 --> 00:44:53.530
<v Speaker 2>It's true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also true that they like.</v>

883
00:44:53.531 --> 00:44:58.531
<v Speaker 2>I've been a part of stories that I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>talked to the author of it and they </v>

884
00:44:58.531 --> 00:44:58.531
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

885
00:44:58.531 --> 00:45:00.580
<v Speaker 2>this was manipulated by the editor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The editor manipulated the title,</v>

886
00:45:00.581 --> 00:45:03.470
<v Speaker 2>the chain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a great excuse the perspective,</v>

887
00:45:03.530 --> 00:45:08.530
<v Speaker 2>but it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the rolling stone did an article </v>

888
00:45:08.530 --> 00:45:11.611
<v Speaker 2>about me and they called me as </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic warrior and I said to the </v>

889
00:45:11.611 --> 00:45:11.740
<v Speaker 2>guy who wrote down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is that?</v>

890
00:45:11.741 --> 00:45:13.000
<v Speaker 2>I was laughing and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

891
00:45:13.001 --> 00:45:14.660
<v Speaker 2>I did not write that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

892
00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:18.100
<v Speaker 2>The editor gets a hold of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tries to make it more salacious.</v>

893
00:45:18.101 --> 00:45:20.200
<v Speaker 2>It becomes something that's</v>

894
00:45:20.590 --> 00:45:25.590
<v Speaker 3>more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's more likely for people to buy or </v>

895
00:45:25.590 --> 00:45:25.590
<v Speaker 3>click.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

896
00:45:25.590 --> 00:45:29.940
<v Speaker 3>Especially with headlines that that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>true and the real problem is that the </v>

897
00:45:30.241 --> 00:45:35.241
<v Speaker 3>sort of outrage culture and comment </v>
<v Speaker 3>culture that has emerged provides no </v>

898
00:45:35.241 --> 00:45:40.231
<v Speaker 3>incentive for truth because suppose </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone were to write an article about </v>

899
00:45:40.811 --> 00:45:45.811
<v Speaker 3>this conversation we're having right now</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it could say Hamilton Morris says </v>

900
00:45:45.811 --> 00:45:47.050
<v Speaker 3>Creton should be illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or something like that.</v>

901
00:45:47.140 --> 00:45:52.140
<v Speaker 3>Then that will get so much more </v>
<v Speaker 3>engagement because then you'll have all </v>

902
00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:52.140
<v Speaker 3>these people saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck Hamilton.</v>

903
00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:52.810
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a,</v>

904
00:45:52.870 --> 00:45:55.060
<v Speaker 3>he's a trader.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How dare he say that?</v>

905
00:45:55.061 --> 00:46:00.061
<v Speaker 3>It should be illegal that it didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>watch it and then you'll have other </v>

906
00:46:00.061 --> 00:46:00.061
<v Speaker 3>people arguing with those people saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

907
00:46:00.061 --> 00:46:00.830
<v Speaker 3>listen to the interview.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

908
00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:05.880
<v Speaker 3>he actually never said anything about </v>
<v Speaker 3>that and listened carefully to what you </v>

909
00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:05.890
<v Speaker 3>saying and then you create this whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>engagement,</v>

910
00:46:05.891 --> 00:46:08.140
<v Speaker 3>a bigger engagement for doing the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

911
00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:09.790
<v Speaker 3>Then you'd get for doing the right </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

912
00:46:09.850 --> 00:46:10.380
<v Speaker 3>True,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>

913
00:46:10.381 --> 00:46:10.500
<v Speaker 3>But</v>

914
00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:15.240
<v Speaker 2>the initial statement is much stickier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The initial statement of Hamilton Morris</v>

915
00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:20.270
<v Speaker 2>is a bad guy because he thinks kratom </v>
<v Speaker 2>should be illegal or Katam should be </v>

916
00:46:20.270 --> 00:46:24.351
<v Speaker 2>illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is what more people are going to </v>

917
00:46:24.351 --> 00:46:24.990
<v Speaker 2>pay attention to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Far less people read the retraction than</v>

918
00:46:24.991 --> 00:46:27.960
<v Speaker 2>read the initial worries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is one of the more insidious things</v>

919
00:46:27.961 --> 00:46:31.260
<v Speaker 2>about printing things that are patently </v>
<v Speaker 2>untrue,</v>

920
00:46:31.710 --> 00:46:36.710
<v Speaker 2>purposely that people do do things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are untrue with the caveat that they </v>

921
00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:41.331
<v Speaker 2>could just print a retraction that maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>30 percent of the people that read the </v>

922
00:46:41.331 --> 00:46:41.331
<v Speaker 2>original article,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to read that.</v>

923
00:46:41.331 --> 00:46:44.220
<v Speaker 2>The initial imprint is what's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>stick with people.</v>

924
00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:46.980
<v Speaker 2>Even if you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone calls you a rapist,</v>

925
00:46:47.070 --> 00:46:52.070
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it turns out that the person </v>

926
00:46:52.070 --> 00:46:54.021
<v Speaker 2>who called you a rapist was lying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The people heard you were a rapist </v>

927
00:46:54.021 --> 00:46:54.120
<v Speaker 2>first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They still have that in their head.</v>

928
00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:56.520
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a rapist rapist,</v>

929
00:46:56.550 --> 00:46:57.510
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

930
00:46:57.720 --> 00:47:00.720
<v Speaker 2>it's very difficult to get slippery </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas out of people's heads.</v>

931
00:47:00.721 --> 00:47:05.721
<v Speaker 2>So if somebody writes some articles </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying that you're against the </v>

932
00:47:05.721 --> 00:47:10.041
<v Speaker 2>legalization of certain drugs and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>start looking at you as being </v>

933
00:47:10.041 --> 00:47:13.251
<v Speaker 2>compromised,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the influence that people have </v>

934
00:47:13.251 --> 00:47:15.810
<v Speaker 2>today can't be understated because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>reach is so powerful.</v>

935
00:47:15.930 --> 00:47:19.800
<v Speaker 2>The reach of any article,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any video,</v>

936
00:47:19.890 --> 00:47:24.890
<v Speaker 2>any.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so significantly greater than any </v>

937
00:47:24.890 --> 00:47:28.761
<v Speaker 2>other sort of distribution of </v>
<v Speaker 2>information in the history of human </v>

938
00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:30.070
<v Speaker 2>beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have the</v>

939
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:34.720
<v Speaker 1>potential for it impacting large groups </v>
<v Speaker 1>of people is so huge now.</v>

940
00:47:34.830 --> 00:47:39.830
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is the result of that is also </v>

941
00:47:39.830 --> 00:47:42.991
<v Speaker 1>that the viewers have a lot of power and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that in some sense they don't </v>

942
00:47:42.991 --> 00:47:45.220
<v Speaker 1>quite recognize the nature of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>

943
00:47:45.221 --> 00:47:49.210
<v Speaker 1>It's like voting with your dollar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you spend all of your time commenting</v>

944
00:47:49.211 --> 00:47:54.211
<v Speaker 1>hatefully on things you don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are actively encouraging the </v>

945
00:47:54.211 --> 00:47:56.230
<v Speaker 1>production of more of that thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't like.</v>

946
00:47:56.530 --> 00:47:59.770
<v Speaker 1>If you like something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to engage with what you approve</v>

947
00:47:59.771 --> 00:48:03.850
<v Speaker 1>of more because every time you engage </v>
<v Speaker 1>with something you dislike,</v>

948
00:48:03.910 --> 00:48:08.910
<v Speaker 1>advertisements are sold and it has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>incentivized to do that bad thing and </v>

949
00:48:08.910 --> 00:48:13.261
<v Speaker 1>that's a really sticky thing when we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have this culture where everyone loves </v>

950
00:48:13.261 --> 00:48:17.011
<v Speaker 1>to out show their outrage and virtue </v>
<v Speaker 1>signal and show that they're on the </v>

951
00:48:17.011 --> 00:48:19.150
<v Speaker 1>right side and all this stuff constantly</v>
<v Speaker 1>to say,</v>

952
00:48:19.180 --> 00:48:20.170
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>step back.</v>

953
00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:22.300
<v Speaker 1>You're just feeding the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

954
00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:27.630
<v Speaker 1>I think there's also a problem with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of what people are doing during the </v>

955
00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:32.700
<v Speaker 1>day is something they don't want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of what people are doing is some </v>

956
00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:36.691
<v Speaker 1>job that they don't enjoy and during </v>
<v Speaker 1>that job they have freedom to go online </v>

957
00:48:36.691 --> 00:48:39.970
<v Speaker 1>and in this state of feeling like shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>about what they're doing,</v>

958
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:45.000
<v Speaker 1>they enjoy complaining about stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so the they'll read things and type </v>

959
00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:49.321
<v Speaker 1>things and get engaged in things and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some sort of a sport getting </v>

960
00:48:49.321 --> 00:48:52.720
<v Speaker 1>pissed off about stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead of just spending your time doing</v>

961
00:48:52.721 --> 00:48:55.120
<v Speaker 1>things you actually enjoy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems so simple.</v>

962
00:48:55.180 --> 00:49:00.180
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like a simple solution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you could figure out a way to </v>

963
00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:05.460
<v Speaker 1>actively ignore things that are going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>piss you off and seek out things that </v>

964
00:49:05.801 --> 00:49:07.180
<v Speaker 1>are going to excite you and intrigue </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

965
00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:10.650
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be a healthier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>happier person and it doesn't.</v>

966
00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:12.850
<v Speaker 1>That is that ultimately what everybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants.</v>

967
00:49:13.270 --> 00:49:15.400
<v Speaker 1>I want to be happier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't you want to be happier?</v>

968
00:49:15.430 --> 00:49:20.430
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but why do we seek out shit that pisses </v>

969
00:49:20.430 --> 00:49:20.500
<v Speaker 1>us off?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it becomes a sort of addiction.</v>

970
00:49:20.580 --> 00:49:23.140
<v Speaker 1>It's drug like in and of itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

971
00:49:23.141 --> 00:49:24.490
<v Speaker 1>I see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These arguments,</v>

972
00:49:24.491 --> 00:49:27.610
<v Speaker 1>these people are frittering away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>finite time on earth,</v>

973
00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:33.020
<v Speaker 1>engage in these endless common battles </v>
<v Speaker 1>that no one reads and uh,</v>

974
00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:38.260
<v Speaker 1>and it's a very dark reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is also something that's driving </v>

975
00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:41.380
<v Speaker 1>the current culture of journalism that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're.</v>

976
00:49:41.510 --> 00:49:44.860
<v Speaker 1>Truth doesn't matter as much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All that matters is engagement,</v>

977
00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:46.780
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just clicks.</v>

978
00:49:46.781 --> 00:49:51.781
<v Speaker 1>It's just clicks and money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting that you were saying </v>

979
00:49:51.781 --> 00:49:54.151
<v Speaker 1>something about drugs being inanimate </v>
<v Speaker 1>objects and drugs don't actually kill </v>

980
00:49:54.151 --> 00:49:58.321
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so funny how drug enthusiast </v>

981
00:49:58.321 --> 00:49:59.320
<v Speaker 1>parallel gun enthusiasts with their </v>
<v Speaker 1>arguments.</v>

982
00:49:59.321 --> 00:50:02.290
<v Speaker 1>It's really the same freedom argument </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

983
00:50:02.291 --> 00:50:07.291
<v Speaker 1>it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in an interesting perspective </v>

984
00:50:07.291 --> 00:50:07.540
<v Speaker 1>because I live in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like a whatever,</v>

985
00:50:07.541 --> 00:50:09.910
<v Speaker 1>just a nerdy guy that doesn't let me </v>
<v Speaker 1>guess.</v>

986
00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:14.940
<v Speaker 1>You live in Williamsburg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do a big surprise.</v>

987
00:50:15.041 --> 00:50:20.041
<v Speaker 1>So that's where the office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I live close to the office that I work </v>

988
00:50:20.041 --> 00:50:20.041
<v Speaker 1>at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

989
00:50:20.041 --> 00:50:22.570
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no interest in guns.</v>

990
00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:25.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's really easy for me to say,</v>

991
00:50:25.091 --> 00:50:27.980
<v Speaker 1>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was this shooting and</v>

992
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:32.980
<v Speaker 3>all these people died and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this other guy got shot and these </v>

993
00:50:32.980 --> 00:50:34.040
<v Speaker 3>things are really causing a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>problems.</v>

994
00:50:34.041 --> 00:50:39.041
<v Speaker 3>Let's get rid of them because it doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>impact me and that's where you have to </v>

995
00:50:39.041 --> 00:50:41.321
<v Speaker 3>be the most careful because the worst </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing you can possibly do is make </v>

996
00:50:41.541 --> 00:50:46.541
<v Speaker 3>judgments about how other people should </v>
<v Speaker 3>conduct their lives based on your own </v>

997
00:50:46.541 --> 00:50:47.600
<v Speaker 3>preferences which people do all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

998
00:50:47.601 --> 00:50:48.590
<v Speaker 3>So you hear someone say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

999
00:50:48.591 --> 00:50:50.600
<v Speaker 3>I don't like cannabis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like him.</v>

1000
00:50:50.601 --> 00:50:52.190
<v Speaker 3>I don't smoke it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why should it be legal?</v>

1001
00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:57.280
<v Speaker 3>Because people go to prison for it </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it ruins people's lives who </v>

1002
00:50:57.280 --> 00:51:00.491
<v Speaker 3>aren't your own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you have to think about people that </v>

1003
00:51:00.491 --> 00:51:00.860
<v Speaker 3>aren't you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it's very difficult when it comes</v>

1004
00:51:00.861 --> 00:51:05.861
<v Speaker 3>to gun control issues because this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm faced with that exact same issue </v>

1005
00:51:05.861 --> 00:51:08.300
<v Speaker 3>where it would be so easy for me to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get rid of them all.</v>

1006
00:51:08.350 --> 00:51:10.160
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't impact me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like guns,</v>

1007
00:51:10.370 --> 00:51:13.160
<v Speaker 3>but I don't want to fall into that same </v>
<v Speaker 3>trap.</v>

1008
00:51:13.580 --> 00:51:14.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is a trap</v>

1009
00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:19.640
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it also sort of highlights how slippery </v>

1010
00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:20.670
<v Speaker 2>life is in general that these absolutes </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we look for,</v>

1011
00:51:20.671 --> 00:51:23.370
<v Speaker 2>these ones and Zeros,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't necessarily exist in a lot of</v>

1012
00:51:23.371 --> 00:51:24.840
<v Speaker 2>subjects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1013
00:51:24.841 --> 00:51:29.841
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of people that have done </v>

1014
00:51:29.841 --> 00:51:31.740
<v Speaker 2>bad things that have also done great </v>
<v Speaker 2>things and that gets weird to,</v>

1015
00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:34.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just human beings in general.</v>

1016
00:51:34.351 --> 00:51:35.310
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not,</v>

1017
00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:38.920
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're complex preachers,</v>

1018
00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:44.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and to just categorize something as </v>

1019
00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:44.620
<v Speaker 2>negative or positive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1020
00:51:45.010 --> 00:51:49.600
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of positive things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you could find with drugs.</v>

1021
00:51:49.870 --> 00:51:52.360
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of negative things you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could find the drugs too,</v>

1022
00:51:52.630 --> 00:51:57.630
<v Speaker 2>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mere human behavior does a lot of </v>

1023
00:51:57.630 --> 00:51:57.630
<v Speaker 2>positive and negatives and humans</v>

1024
00:51:57.630 --> 00:51:58.400
<v Speaker 3>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1025
00:51:59.090 --> 00:52:04.090
<v Speaker 3>And back to this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this journalistic issue in the coverage </v>

1026
00:52:04.090 --> 00:52:04.090
<v Speaker 3>of drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1027
00:52:04.090 --> 00:52:08.060
<v Speaker 3>one thing that worries me about the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>cannabis and Creton and psychedelics are</v>

1028
00:52:08.061 --> 00:52:11.090
<v Speaker 3>presented is that it's always couched in</v>
<v Speaker 3>their safe.</v>

1029
00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:12.800
<v Speaker 3>They're therapeutic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're spiritual,</v>

1030
00:52:12.830 --> 00:52:15.530
<v Speaker 3>they're historical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that isn't the point.</v>

1031
00:52:15.590 --> 00:52:17.870
<v Speaker 3>Even if all those things are true and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some debate,</v>

1032
00:52:18.020 --> 00:52:20.480
<v Speaker 3>eventually someone will find a chink in </v>
<v Speaker 3>that armor.</v>

1033
00:52:20.481 --> 00:52:22.730
<v Speaker 3>Someone will die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they're not,</v>

1034
00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:25.610
<v Speaker 3>haven't been used as long as you thought</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were used.</v>

1035
00:52:25.820 --> 00:52:27.800
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they don't always work </v>
<v Speaker 3>therapeutically,</v>

1036
00:52:27.860 --> 00:52:29.570
<v Speaker 3>so then what do you go back to?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Prohibition?</v>

1037
00:52:29.590 --> 00:52:31.220
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why I think you need to emphasize</v>

1038
00:52:31.221 --> 00:52:34.580
<v Speaker 3>cognitive liberty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need to emphasize people to write,</v>

1039
00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:39.760
<v Speaker 3>to explore these alternate states of </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness regardless of whether or </v>

1040
00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:41.450
<v Speaker 3>not they're therapeutic or safe or </v>
<v Speaker 3>traditional or spiritual.</v>

1041
00:52:41.570 --> 00:52:44.870
<v Speaker 3>The point isn't that it's safe or any of</v>
<v Speaker 3>these other things.</v>

1042
00:52:44.871 --> 00:52:47.570
<v Speaker 3>The point is that if you want to live in</v>
<v Speaker 3>a free society,</v>

1043
00:52:47.660 --> 00:52:51.200
<v Speaker 3>you have to be allowed to take a certain</v>
<v Speaker 3>amount of risk.</v>

1044
00:52:51.770 --> 00:52:52.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>

1045
00:52:52.231 --> 00:52:53.120
<v Speaker 3>That's a big point.</v>

1046
00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:58.220
<v Speaker 2>That's a very big point and I think it </v>
<v Speaker 2>really fits well with your description </v>

1047
00:52:58.801 --> 00:53:02.760
<v Speaker 2>of the things that people are allowed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do that are legal,</v>

1048
00:53:02.910 --> 00:53:05.040
<v Speaker 2>that are very dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like race,</v>

1049
00:53:05.041 --> 00:53:06.720
<v Speaker 2>car driving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bungee jumping,</v>

1050
00:53:06.721 --> 00:53:08.550
<v Speaker 2>all these things that we just allow them</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do.</v>

1051
00:53:08.551 --> 00:53:12.510
<v Speaker 2>We don't think twice about it using a </v>
<v Speaker 2>parachute.</v>

1052
00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:16.650
<v Speaker 2>All that crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just openly and nobody's saying,</v>

1053
00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:19.470
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we should ban skydiving.</v>

1054
00:53:19.740 --> 00:53:21.300
<v Speaker 2>There was no one saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fucking.</v>

1055
00:53:21.301 --> 00:53:22.890
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Skydiving,</v>

1056
00:53:22.891 --> 00:53:23.730
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1057
00:53:23.731 --> 00:53:27.300
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't seem to care.</v>

1058
00:53:27.570 --> 00:53:31.230
<v Speaker 2>We seem to care about drugs because we </v>
<v Speaker 2>think that somehow or another,</v>

1059
00:53:31.231 --> 00:53:35.640
<v Speaker 2>either our children or someone we know </v>
<v Speaker 2>is going to be insidiously infected with</v>

1060
00:53:35.641 --> 00:53:37.570
<v Speaker 2>these things they're going to get into </v>
<v Speaker 2>their lives and,</v>

1061
00:53:37.700 --> 00:53:39.640
<v Speaker 2>and fuck them up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1062
00:53:39.650 --> 00:53:42.030
<v Speaker 2>And I think the real problem with that </v>
<v Speaker 2>is education.</v>

1063
00:53:42.060 --> 00:53:43.290
<v Speaker 2>That's the real problem with that.</v>

1064
00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:48.500
<v Speaker 2>I was extremely fortunate in a weird way</v>
<v Speaker 2>to see someone with a cocaine addiction </v>

1065
00:53:48.571 --> 00:53:53.400
<v Speaker 2>when I was in high school as a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>friend's cousin who got really fucked up</v>

1066
00:53:53.401 --> 00:53:58.401
<v Speaker 2>on cocaine when he was a couple of years</v>
<v Speaker 2>older than me and I watched his life </v>

1067
00:53:58.401 --> 00:54:00.900
<v Speaker 2>fall apart and I remember thinking when </v>
<v Speaker 2>I was little like wow,</v>

1068
00:54:00.901 --> 00:54:04.110
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to touch that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like cocaine's fucking terrible.</v>

1069
00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:07.020
<v Speaker 2>And then from then on I've never done </v>
<v Speaker 2>cocaine,</v>

1070
00:54:07.380 --> 00:54:10.610
<v Speaker 2>but it's because of that education </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of.</v>

1071
00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:15.760
<v Speaker 2>And I think real education is something </v>
<v Speaker 2>Pitsa fucking tough thing because you </v>

1072
00:54:17.511 --> 00:54:19.820
<v Speaker 2>don't really just get it from knowing </v>
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>

1073
00:54:19.970 --> 00:54:22.190
<v Speaker 2>You have to see things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to talk to people,</v>

1074
00:54:22.191 --> 00:54:23.510
<v Speaker 2>you have to experience things in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>own.</v>

1075
00:54:23.810 --> 00:54:25.490
<v Speaker 2>Like if someone talks about </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychedelics,</v>

1076
00:54:25.491 --> 00:54:30.491
<v Speaker 2>someone teaches about psychedelics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they have no experience in actual </v>

1077
00:54:30.491 --> 00:54:32.690
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic states personally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very hollow conversation.</v>

1078
00:54:32.960 --> 00:54:37.490
<v Speaker 2>It's like a certain amount of education </v>
<v Speaker 2>has to be from real life experience.</v>

1079
00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:39.090
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

1080
00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:44.360
<v Speaker 3>And the other thing is just again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this idea of pharmacological </v>

1081
00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:46.050
<v Speaker 3>determinism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I had a friend that was very,</v>

1082
00:54:46.051 --> 00:54:51.051
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very seriously addicted to cocaine and </v>

1083
00:54:51.051 --> 00:54:52.860
<v Speaker 3>had the resources to do immense </v>
<v Speaker 3>quantities every single day.</v>

1084
00:54:53.100 --> 00:54:54.810
<v Speaker 3>And he'd always say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1085
00:54:54.811 --> 00:54:56.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I try heroin,</v>

1086
00:54:56.521 --> 00:55:00.450
<v Speaker 3>I know it's all over for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that will be the last straw,</v>

1087
00:55:00.451 --> 00:55:02.760
<v Speaker 3>so I'm never touching that stuff and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't.</v>

1088
00:55:03.030 --> 00:55:04.860
<v Speaker 3>But my own perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1089
00:55:04.861 --> 00:55:09.861
<v Speaker 3>I've essentially tried everything and if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you really just think about these things</v>

1090
00:55:11.750 --> 00:55:13.220
<v Speaker 3>you can actually learn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>

1091
00:55:13.221 --> 00:55:15.080
<v Speaker 3>I've tried heroin once,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't think.</v>

1092
00:55:15.081 --> 00:55:17.060
<v Speaker 3>Was that interesting?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you do it injecting?</v>

1093
00:55:17.090 --> 00:55:18.300
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you snort it.</v>

1094
00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:19.010
<v Speaker 3>I snorted it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1095
00:55:19.011 --> 00:55:19.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was it like?</v>

1096
00:55:20.180 --> 00:55:21.360
<v Speaker 3>It was boring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

1097
00:55:21.380 --> 00:55:22.160
<v Speaker 3>Boring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1098
00:55:22.220 --> 00:55:25.400
<v Speaker 3>I don't think opiates are very </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting drugs psychologically.</v>

1099
00:55:25.460 --> 00:55:27.740
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I were to be totally honest,</v>

1100
00:55:27.741 --> 00:55:32.741
<v Speaker 3>I think the cannabis is more euphoric </v>
<v Speaker 3>and has so few side effects.</v>

1101
00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:35.060
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>opioids cause horrible constipation.</v>

1102
00:55:35.061 --> 00:55:38.150
<v Speaker 3>They cause all kinds of weird sweating </v>
<v Speaker 3>problems.</v>

1103
00:55:38.151 --> 00:55:40.160
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they're especially </v>
<v Speaker 3>pleasant drugs,</v>

1104
00:55:40.220 --> 00:55:43.760
<v Speaker 3>but they're romanticized so much in our </v>
<v Speaker 3>culture that people think that's it.</v>

1105
00:55:43.940 --> 00:55:45.410
<v Speaker 3>Heroin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ultimate high.</v>

1106
00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:47.450
<v Speaker 3>Well maybe it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's not even that great at all.</v>

1107
00:55:47.451 --> 00:55:49.710
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's garbage and it doesn't even </v>
<v Speaker 3>matter.</v>

1108
00:55:49.770 --> 00:55:51.740
<v Speaker 3>That's the same way I feel about snorted</v>
<v Speaker 3>cocaine.</v>

1109
00:55:51.770 --> 00:55:55.910
<v Speaker 3>I don't even think it's a good drug.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not an issue of it's so addictive.</v>

1110
00:55:55.911 --> 00:55:58.520
<v Speaker 3>You've got to stay away from it because </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so damn good.</v>

1111
00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:01.520
<v Speaker 3>It's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not even an enjoyable high.</v>

1112
00:56:01.521 --> 00:56:06.521
<v Speaker 3>It has a short duration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It you then feel bad almost immediately </v>

1113
00:56:06.521 --> 00:56:08.600
<v Speaker 3>afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a flawed substance.</v>

1114
00:56:08.601 --> 00:56:10.220
<v Speaker 3>Same is true of alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think as well.</v>

1115
00:56:10.221 --> 00:56:13.880
<v Speaker 3>Alcohol is a crazily flawed molecule.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's terrible.</v>

1116
00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:19.120
<v Speaker 3>No other drug that I can think of causes</v>
<v Speaker 3>a hangover of that type where there's a </v>

1117
00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:23.060
<v Speaker 3>toxic metabolite that poisons you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The following day,</v>

1118
00:56:23.590 --> 00:56:24.400
<v Speaker 3>Dr Carl Hart</v>

1119
00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:29.400
<v Speaker 2>was trying to explain to me what that is</v>
<v Speaker 2>and essentially he was saying that when </v>

1120
00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:33.571
<v Speaker 2>you are getting a hangover,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's your body reacting to the addictive</v>

1121
00:56:33.641 --> 00:56:38.641
<v Speaker 2>properties of alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're getting addicted to alcohol </v>

1122
00:56:38.641 --> 00:56:41.971
<v Speaker 2>almost almost immediately that your body</v>
<v Speaker 2>is compensating for that and then these,</v>

1123
00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:43.760
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1124
00:56:44.210 --> 00:56:47.930
<v Speaker 2>this hangover is not just you being </v>
<v Speaker 2>dehydrated,</v>

1125
00:56:47.931 --> 00:56:50.030
<v Speaker 2>it's also your body withdrawing from </v>
<v Speaker 2>alcohol.</v>

1126
00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:55.960
<v Speaker 3>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am not familiar with any evidence for </v>

1127
00:56:55.960 --> 00:56:57.310
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dr Garcia actually tried to enter in the</v>

1128
00:56:57.320 --> 00:56:59.060
<v Speaker 3>forum when I first moved to love that </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>

1129
00:56:59.110 --> 00:56:59.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he.</v>

1130
00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:01.440
<v Speaker 3>I have a lot of respect for them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean there's a.</v>

1131
00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:06.640
<v Speaker 3>I'd have to look at is source for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd have to also look at the way I </v>

1132
00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:06.980
<v Speaker 3>described it because I probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>butchered it.</v>

1133
00:57:07.100 --> 00:57:12.100
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's an alternate explanation </v>

1134
00:57:12.100 --> 00:57:14.261
<v Speaker 3>that's even simpler,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is simply that alcohol is </v>

1135
00:57:14.261 --> 00:57:15.150
<v Speaker 3>metabolized into chemical assets held to</v>
<v Speaker 3>high.</v>

1136
00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:17.780
<v Speaker 3>That's toxic so and with alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a very,</v>

1137
00:57:17.781 --> 00:57:19.130
<v Speaker 3>very weak drug.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By weight,</v>

1138
00:57:19.131 --> 00:57:24.131
<v Speaker 3>you're consuming insane amounts in terms</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the number of molecules you're </v>

1139
00:57:24.131 --> 00:57:28.870
<v Speaker 3>consuming insane quantities of the drug.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So all of this acid aldehyde accumulates</v>

1140
00:57:29.751 --> 00:57:32.270
<v Speaker 3>in your body and it has a directly toxic</v>
<v Speaker 3>effect.</v>

1141
00:57:32.360 --> 00:57:35.180
<v Speaker 3>Is there a way to counteract that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mitigate the effects?</v>

1142
00:57:35.390 --> 00:57:37.760
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are proposed ways to do it.</v>

1143
00:57:37.761 --> 00:57:42.761
<v Speaker 3>I haven't experimented with any of them </v>
<v Speaker 3>myself because they don't really like </v>

1144
00:57:42.761 --> 00:57:44.600
<v Speaker 3>alcohol that much to begin with is in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>glutathione that's a,</v>

1145
00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:48.660
<v Speaker 2>that's something that allows your body </v>
<v Speaker 2>to process it more easily.</v>

1146
00:57:49.500 --> 00:57:52.380
<v Speaker 3>It would have to be something that </v>
<v Speaker 3>prevents this specific conversion.</v>

1147
00:57:52.620 --> 00:57:56.670
<v Speaker 3>I don't know off the top of my head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What about Krokodil?</v>

1148
00:57:56.671 --> 00:57:58.280
<v Speaker 3>You ever fuck with that stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1149
00:57:58.281 --> 00:58:03.281
<v Speaker 3>this is another perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you take a drug like Krokodil and </v>

1150
00:58:03.281 --> 00:58:03.630
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it sounds horrible.</v>

1151
00:58:03.640 --> 00:58:06.390
<v Speaker 3>The Internet's drug the other fear drug,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yet people are.</v>

1152
00:58:06.510 --> 00:58:09.090
<v Speaker 3>But behind every scare story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing.</v>

1153
00:58:09.130 --> 00:58:12.810
<v Speaker 3>Explain what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's a scare story that,</v>

1154
00:58:12.811 --> 00:58:16.220
<v Speaker 3>I believe it was in Moscow somewhere in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Russia in,</v>

1155
00:58:16.230 --> 00:58:21.230
<v Speaker 3>and this was hitting the news around </v>
<v Speaker 3>2004.</v>

1156
00:58:21.330 --> 00:58:21.560
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1157
00:58:21.570 --> 00:58:22.440
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>much later,</v>

1158
00:58:22.441 --> 00:58:26.910
<v Speaker 3>2010,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

1159
00:58:26.940 --> 00:58:28.590
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

1160
00:58:28.890 --> 00:58:31.110
<v Speaker 3>and the idea was that this is the worst </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

1161
00:58:31.111 --> 00:58:36.111
<v Speaker 3>It's ultra addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You inject it and then you lose a limb </v>

1162
00:58:36.111 --> 00:58:39.010
<v Speaker 3>and you have profound necrosis all </v>
<v Speaker 3>around the injection site,</v>

1163
00:58:39.100 --> 00:58:41.650
<v Speaker 3>and this is the worst drug,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most addictive drug of all time.</v>

1164
00:58:41.800 --> 00:58:46.800
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the drug itself is called desert </v>

1165
00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:48.770
<v Speaker 3>morphine and it's been used medicinally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing especially addictive or </v>

1166
00:58:48.770 --> 00:58:53.101
<v Speaker 3>dangerous at all that desert morphine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem is that people were </v>

1167
00:58:53.101 --> 00:58:56.401
<v Speaker 3>injecting completely impure reaction </v>
<v Speaker 3>mixtures that had all of the components </v>

1168
00:58:57.590 --> 00:58:59.810
<v Speaker 3>from the synthesis that hadn't been </v>
<v Speaker 3>removed,</v>

1169
00:59:00.650 --> 00:59:03.380
<v Speaker 3>including phosphorus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is immensely toxic,</v>

1170
00:59:03.650 --> 00:59:08.650
<v Speaker 3>so you have people basically reporting </v>
<v Speaker 3>on ivy phosphorus toxicity as if it were</v>

1171
00:59:10.431 --> 00:59:13.250
<v Speaker 3>a result of this drug when it's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely separate issue,</v>

1172
00:59:14.270 --> 00:59:16.460
<v Speaker 3>and this is what you see when you look </v>
<v Speaker 3>at all of these things.</v>

1173
00:59:16.461 --> 00:59:19.220
<v Speaker 3>It's never the drug,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any drug scare story.</v>

1174
00:59:19.221 --> 00:59:24.221
<v Speaker 3>It's never the drug.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You always have to look for the root </v>

1175
00:59:24.221 --> 00:59:26.180
<v Speaker 3>cause because it's never the drug.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's never been a drug in history and</v>

1176
00:59:26.181 --> 00:59:29.870
<v Speaker 3>that is why if you look at the dea list </v>
<v Speaker 3>of controlled substances,</v>

1177
00:59:30.350 --> 00:59:33.870
<v Speaker 3>it's not dangerous drugs that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>controlled.</v>

1178
00:59:34.140 --> 00:59:35.850
<v Speaker 3>It's enjoyable drugs.</v>

1179
00:59:36.530 --> 00:59:39.470
<v Speaker 3>Something like tetrodotoxin the chemical</v>
<v Speaker 3>and puffer fish.</v>

1180
00:59:39.471 --> 00:59:42.380
<v Speaker 3>That's not a controlled substance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some regulations in terms of how</v>

1181
00:59:42.381 --> 00:59:44.540
<v Speaker 3>much you can purchase,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not a controlled substance.</v>

1182
00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:47.810
<v Speaker 3>Sega toxin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most potent known neurotoxin.</v>

1183
00:59:48.530 --> 00:59:52.440
<v Speaker 3>It's not a controlled substance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lead isn't a controlled substance.</v>

1184
00:59:52.441 --> 00:59:57.441
<v Speaker 3>Mercury isn't a controlled substance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mercury chloride isn't a controlled </v>

1185
00:59:57.441 --> 00:59:58.710
<v Speaker 3>substance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of the deadly poisons.</v>

1186
00:59:58.830 --> 01:00:03.830
<v Speaker 3>Cyanide isn't a controlled substance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not about what's safe and what's </v>

1187
01:00:03.830 --> 01:00:04.110
<v Speaker 3>dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's about what people like to use.</v>

1188
01:00:04.111 --> 01:00:06.660
<v Speaker 3>What's enjoyable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is the root of that.</v>

1189
01:00:08.430 --> 01:00:09.450
<v Speaker 3>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1190
01:00:09.451 --> 01:00:14.451
<v Speaker 3>a puritanical idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that any sort of euphoria is bad.</v>

1191
01:00:15.981 --> 01:00:20.981
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>euphoria is listed as a side effect in </v>

1192
01:00:20.981 --> 01:00:23.531
<v Speaker 3>some medications.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We assume that it's a bad thing to deal </v>

1193
01:00:23.531 --> 01:00:25.850
<v Speaker 3>with diarrhea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like euphoria.</v>

1194
01:00:25.851 --> 01:00:26.450
<v Speaker 3>Diarrhea.</v>

1195
01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:27.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1196
01:00:27.921 --> 01:00:29.420
<v Speaker 4>That is a strange thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that's gonna.</v>

1197
01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:31.160
<v Speaker 4>It's gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cut back productivity,</v>

1198
01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:35.420
<v Speaker 4>make you a lazy Ne'er do well and just </v>
<v Speaker 4>become a,</v>

1199
01:00:35.490 --> 01:00:38.990
<v Speaker 4>a burden on society.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's common,</v>

1200
01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:41.790
<v Speaker 3>common way of describing people use </v>
<v Speaker 3>drugs.</v>

1201
01:00:41.820 --> 01:00:46.820
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this fundamental idea that sobriety </v>

1202
01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:46.820
<v Speaker 3>is good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1203
01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:46.950
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you look on Instagram,</v>

1204
01:00:46.951 --> 01:00:49.860
<v Speaker 3>people post a selfie and say six months </v>
<v Speaker 3>sober.</v>

1205
01:00:49.861 --> 01:00:54.861
<v Speaker 3>Guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thank you so much and tons of </v>

1206
01:00:54.861 --> 01:00:55.230
<v Speaker 3>congratulations because it's a virtue </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you accomplished something.</v>

1207
01:00:55.231 --> 01:00:57.120
<v Speaker 3>You're not using drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1208
01:00:57.940 --> 01:01:00.800
<v Speaker 3>Whereas in other cultures that would not</v>
<v Speaker 3>be the case.</v>

1209
01:01:00.801 --> 01:01:01.520
<v Speaker 3>People would just say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1210
01:01:01.521 --> 01:01:05.270
<v Speaker 3>you've decided not to work with a a </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain medicine.</v>

1211
01:01:05.830 --> 01:01:08.130
<v Speaker 3>That's an interesting choice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not An accomplishment.</v>

1212
01:01:08.170 --> 01:01:13.170
<v Speaker 4>I was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was it Kyle Kingsbury there was saying </v>

1213
01:01:13.170 --> 01:01:14.020
<v Speaker 4>that how much he hates the term plant </v>
<v Speaker 4>medicine or was it Dennis?</v>

1214
01:01:14.550 --> 01:01:19.010
<v Speaker 3>That was kyle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't like the term plant medicine,</v>

1215
01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:21.100
<v Speaker 3>do I don't?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1216
01:01:21.190 --> 01:01:23.860
<v Speaker 3>Dubai is a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a weird sort of pretentious.</v>

1217
01:01:23.890 --> 01:01:24.610
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1218
01:01:24.611 --> 01:01:25.030
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1219
01:01:25.031 --> 01:01:27.430
<v Speaker 3>people call Iowasca the medicine or </v>
<v Speaker 3>things like that.</v>

1220
01:01:27.431 --> 01:01:28.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or towed medicine.</v>

1221
01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:29.710
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't.</v>

1222
01:01:30.450 --> 01:01:33.350
<v Speaker 3>You don't hate it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I a lot of these,</v>

1223
01:01:33.351 --> 01:01:34.560
<v Speaker 3>like more flowery terms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

1224
01:01:34.580 --> 01:01:36.440
<v Speaker 3>theologian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't use them myself,</v>

1225
01:01:36.441 --> 01:01:39.300
<v Speaker 3>but I don't hate it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would your,</v>

1226
01:01:39.890 --> 01:01:44.890
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think people like you are very </v>

1227
01:01:44.890 --> 01:01:46.571
<v Speaker 4>important and I'm a big fan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think one of the reasons why </v>

1228
01:01:46.571 --> 01:01:50.080
<v Speaker 4>you're important as you are a cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 4>center of real drugs like you,</v>

1229
01:01:51.131 --> 01:01:56.131
<v Speaker 4>you understand what they actually do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could explain them to the layman or </v>

1230
01:01:56.961 --> 01:02:01.910
<v Speaker 4>you could debate them with someone who </v>
<v Speaker 4>was a doctor perhaps that wanted to,</v>

1231
01:02:02.310 --> 01:02:07.310
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to talk about the dangers of them and </v>

1232
01:02:07.310 --> 01:02:08.891
<v Speaker 4>you understand all the various aspects </v>
<v Speaker 4>of it and I think there's a tremendous </v>

1233
01:02:08.891 --> 01:02:11.000
<v Speaker 4>amount of ignorance when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 4>drugs,</v>

1234
01:02:11.001 --> 01:02:12.890
<v Speaker 4>drug consumption.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is a drug?</v>

1235
01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:17.920
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how many times have you seen a person </v>

1236
01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:17.920
<v Speaker 4>with a beer in their hand smoking a </v>
<v Speaker 4>cigarette saying they don't do drugs.</v>

1237
01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:19.290
<v Speaker 4>It is so fucking stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's.</v>

1238
01:02:19.291 --> 01:02:23.350
<v Speaker 4>It's so common.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is this very,</v>

1239
01:02:23.351 --> 01:02:28.351
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very common aspect of being a person </v>

1240
01:02:28.351 --> 01:02:31.260
<v Speaker 4>which is these desire to change your </v>
<v Speaker 4>mental state and we've done it </v>

1241
01:02:31.341 --> 01:02:33.050
<v Speaker 4>throughout history with various </v>
<v Speaker 4>substances,</v>

1242
01:02:33.470 --> 01:02:38.150
<v Speaker 4>but there's so much stigma attached to </v>
<v Speaker 4>it and one of the things I've been doing</v>

1243
01:02:38.151 --> 01:02:40.190
<v Speaker 4>lately on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll ask people,</v>

1244
01:02:40.191 --> 01:02:43.230
<v Speaker 4>how many people get piss tested at work?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking stunning.</v>

1245
01:02:43.530 --> 01:02:48.530
<v Speaker 4>It's stunning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like more than 10 percent of the </v>

1246
01:02:48.530 --> 01:02:50.601
<v Speaker 4>audience will raise their hand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like one out of 10 people gets through </v>

1247
01:02:50.601 --> 01:02:53.310
<v Speaker 4>their body tested to make sure that </v>
<v Speaker 4>while they're not working,</v>

1248
01:02:53.311 --> 01:02:58.311
<v Speaker 4>they're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not putting anything in their </v>

1249
01:02:58.311 --> 01:02:58.311
<v Speaker 4>body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's prohibited,</v>

1250
01:02:58.311 --> 01:03:01.350
<v Speaker 3>which is such a horrible invasion of </v>
<v Speaker 3>privacy that became so popular that in </v>

1251
01:03:01.350 --> 01:03:03.190
<v Speaker 3>the eighties during one presidential </v>
<v Speaker 3>election,</v>

1252
01:03:03.191 --> 01:03:08.191
<v Speaker 3>all the candidates voluntarily had their</v>
<v Speaker 3>urine tested to prove that they were </v>

1253
01:03:08.191 --> 01:03:08.191
<v Speaker 3>sober.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1254
01:03:08.191 --> 01:03:11.560
<v Speaker 3>this is like truly considered a virtue </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's immensely invasive.</v>

1255
01:03:11.561 --> 01:03:16.561
<v Speaker 3>I say this as someone who's analyzed my </v>
<v Speaker 3>own urine in a laboratory before and </v>

1256
01:03:16.561 --> 01:03:19.090
<v Speaker 3>it's like a strange portal into your own</v>
<v Speaker 3>life that you're showing to a stranger.</v>

1257
01:03:19.091 --> 01:03:21.640
<v Speaker 3>Everything that you've consumed is then </v>
<v Speaker 3>a parent there.</v>

1258
01:03:21.641 --> 01:03:22.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's incredibly.</v>

1259
01:03:22.961 --> 01:03:26.950
<v Speaker 3>It's a huge invasion of privacy that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we've just decided is acceptable and you</v>

1260
01:03:26.951 --> 01:03:29.110
<v Speaker 3>have to be very careful about these </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

1261
01:03:29.111 --> 01:03:30.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1262
01:03:30.161 --> 01:03:35.161
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's and of course the synthetic </v>

1263
01:03:35.161 --> 01:03:36.040
<v Speaker 3>cannabinoid epidemic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you want to call it that,</v>

1264
01:03:36.041 --> 01:03:41.041
<v Speaker 3>I actually don't want to call it that </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I hate even the idea of a drug </v>

1265
01:03:41.041 --> 01:03:45.121
<v Speaker 3>epidemic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the popularity of synthetic </v>

1266
01:03:45.121 --> 01:03:47.011
<v Speaker 3>cannabinoids is largely driven by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fact that they didn't show up on these </v>

1267
01:03:47.011 --> 01:03:49.690
<v Speaker 3>urine tests,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so initially it was in the military than</v>

1268
01:03:49.750 --> 01:03:52.480
<v Speaker 3>it was people who are on parole or </v>
<v Speaker 3>probation.</v>

1269
01:03:52.690 --> 01:03:56.610
<v Speaker 3>People who were living hard lives </v>
<v Speaker 3>wanting to get high,</v>

1270
01:03:56.680 --> 01:03:58.960
<v Speaker 3>couldn't get high.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was a way that they could do it,</v>

1271
01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:04.080
<v Speaker 3>and so they've incentivized people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>just wanted to smoke weed using </v>

1272
01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:06.190
<v Speaker 3>completely untested synthetic </v>
<v Speaker 3>cannabinoids instead,</v>

1273
01:04:06.250 --> 01:04:08.350
<v Speaker 3>as a direct result of these urine tests.</v>

1274
01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:16.240
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's also just a complete </v>

1275
01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:17.621
<v Speaker 4>misunderstanding that comes to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>actual effects and how long they last </v>

1276
01:04:17.621 --> 01:04:22.531
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now you're not even testing a person's </v>

1277
01:04:22.531 --> 01:04:24.480
<v Speaker 4>conscious state.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're testing whether or not a person </v>

1278
01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:26.440
<v Speaker 4>has altered their state of consciousness</v>
<v Speaker 4>outside of their working time.</v>

1279
01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:30.100
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not like you show up and they could</v>

1280
01:04:30.250 --> 01:04:33.460
<v Speaker 4>scan your hand and realize that you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>high on marijuana right now.</v>

1281
01:04:33.790 --> 01:04:38.790
<v Speaker 4>That's not what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What they're doing is they're testing </v>

1282
01:04:38.790 --> 01:04:42.061
<v Speaker 4>you for something that could linger in </v>
<v Speaker 4>your body for weeks after the </v>

1283
01:04:42.061 --> 01:04:42.370
<v Speaker 4>psychoactive effects of long since gone,</v>

1284
01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:48.000
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or even be the result of passive </v>

1285
01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.131
<v Speaker 3>exposure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a great scientific article </v>

1286
01:04:50.131 --> 01:04:52.321
<v Speaker 3>that came out a couple of years ago </v>
<v Speaker 3>where they found that just passive </v>

1287
01:04:52.321 --> 01:04:55.201
<v Speaker 3>exposure to cannabis smoke contaminates </v>
<v Speaker 3>your hair with thc so that all these </v>

1288
01:04:55.201 --> 01:04:58.120
<v Speaker 3>people who had hair tests,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who actually had not smoked cannabis,</v>

1289
01:04:58.121 --> 01:05:00.400
<v Speaker 3>but it sounds like an excuse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just in the room,</v>

1290
01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:03.700
<v Speaker 3>someone else is doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just being in contact with someone who'd</v>

1291
01:05:03.701 --> 01:05:08.701
<v Speaker 3>smoked cannabis could then deposit thc </v>
<v Speaker 3>in your hair and cause you to test </v>

1292
01:05:08.701 --> 01:05:10.690
<v Speaker 3>positive so these tests aren't even </v>
<v Speaker 3>necessarily reliable.</v>

1293
01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:14.200
<v Speaker 3>This is the same problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a kind of trend a little while</v>

1294
01:05:14.201 --> 01:05:15.220
<v Speaker 3>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you saw about this,</v>

1295
01:05:15.221 --> 01:05:20.221
<v Speaker 3>where people would get their urine for </v>
<v Speaker 3>different to quantify the levels of </v>

1296
01:05:20.221 --> 01:05:22.510
<v Speaker 3>neurotransmitter metabolites in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>urine and this was supposed to be like a</v>

1297
01:05:22.511 --> 01:05:27.511
<v Speaker 3>fingerprint of your mood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they'd quantify the level of </v>

1298
01:05:27.511 --> 01:05:27.511
<v Speaker 3>Serotonin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dopamine,</v>

1299
01:05:27.511 --> 01:05:27.910
<v Speaker 3>Gaba,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

1300
01:05:27.911 --> 01:05:28.780
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

1301
01:05:28.930 --> 01:05:29.590
<v Speaker 3>and then they'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1302
01:05:29.591 --> 01:05:32.020
<v Speaker 3>you're a little low on Saratonin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're pretty depressed.</v>

1303
01:05:32.021 --> 01:05:37.021
<v Speaker 3>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need to supplement with some five </v>

1304
01:05:37.021 --> 01:05:38.731
<v Speaker 3>htp or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very reductive way of thinking </v>

1305
01:05:38.731 --> 01:05:41.161
<v Speaker 3>about consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the main issue is that you're not </v>

1306
01:05:41.161 --> 01:05:43.681
<v Speaker 3>testing in your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're testing or urine and a lot of </v>

1307
01:05:43.681 --> 01:05:43.681
<v Speaker 3>these neurotransmitters are biosynthesis</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the periphery,</v>

1308
01:05:43.681 --> 01:05:48.510
<v Speaker 3>so just because you have these </v>
<v Speaker 3>neurotransmitters in your urine doesn't </v>

1309
01:05:48.510 --> 01:05:49.720
<v Speaker 3>mean they were ever in your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't say anything about anything,</v>

1310
01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:56.030
<v Speaker 4>so it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so juvenile in a way.</v>

1311
01:05:56.220 --> 01:06:01.220
<v Speaker 4>It's such a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's such a piss poor way of maintaining</v>

1312
01:06:01.701 --> 01:06:02.180
<v Speaker 4>order,</v>

1313
01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:04.950
<v Speaker 3>checking people's</v>

1314
01:06:05.110 --> 01:06:10.110
<v Speaker 4>consciousness and make immediate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What you should do is judge people based</v>

1315
01:06:10.571 --> 01:06:15.571
<v Speaker 4>on the productivity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I have some guy and he shows up work </v>

1316
01:06:15.571 --> 01:06:15.610
<v Speaker 4>and he kicks ass everyday,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1317
01:06:15.611 --> 01:06:16.650
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's your secret?</v>

1318
01:06:16.940 --> 01:06:18.850
<v Speaker 4>I get high.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Get high before work.</v>

1319
01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:21.130
<v Speaker 4>It's great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel good having a good time at work.</v>

1320
01:06:21.430 --> 01:06:26.430
<v Speaker 4>Zippity Doo da Zippity Day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm putting everything in order and it </v>

1321
01:06:26.430 --> 01:06:26.680
<v Speaker 4>just feels good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like keep doing what you're doing.</v>

1322
01:06:28.050 --> 01:06:33.050
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's how it should be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We should be judged based on whether or </v>

1323
01:06:33.050 --> 01:06:34.420
<v Speaker 4>not whatever we're doing is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1324
01:06:34.510 --> 01:06:35.020
<v Speaker 4>I guess</v>

1325
01:06:35.300 --> 01:06:35.780
<v Speaker 3>the real</v>

1326
01:06:36.530 --> 01:06:39.140
<v Speaker 4>caveat to bed would be people that do </v>
<v Speaker 4>speed.</v>

1327
01:06:39.410 --> 01:06:40.380
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1328
01:06:41.390 --> 01:06:45.260
<v Speaker 4>you get pretty productive for a short </v>
<v Speaker 4>period of time doing speed,</v>

1329
01:06:45.261 --> 01:06:47.450
<v Speaker 4>but I think the downside of that,</v>

1330
01:06:48.250 --> 01:06:49.840
<v Speaker 3>there's so many people that are on </v>
<v Speaker 3>adderall today.</v>

1331
01:06:49.841 --> 01:06:50.380
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

1332
01:06:50.420 --> 01:06:55.420
<v Speaker 3>what are your feelings on that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that it's a very interesting </v>

1333
01:06:55.420 --> 01:06:58.800
<v Speaker 3>issue because it's amazing when you look</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the history of all these things,</v>

1334
01:06:58.801 --> 01:07:02.280
<v Speaker 3>have these issues repeat themselves over</v>
<v Speaker 3>and over and over again.</v>

1335
01:07:02.281 --> 01:07:05.010
<v Speaker 3>So it was a problem in the fifties and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a problem in the sixties and it's a</v>

1336
01:07:05.011 --> 01:07:07.200
<v Speaker 3>problem in the seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now it's a problem now.</v>

1337
01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:09.780
<v Speaker 3>It's always a problem that we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>treating as if it were a new thing,</v>

1338
01:07:09.781 --> 01:07:14.781
<v Speaker 3>but people have been using amphetamines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stimulants for the better part of 100 </v>

1339
01:07:14.781 --> 01:07:17.000
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

1340
01:07:17.810 --> 01:07:20.690
<v Speaker 3>people will now the kind of popular </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing to say is,</v>

1341
01:07:20.860 --> 01:07:21.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't you know,</v>

1342
01:07:21.891 --> 01:07:24.770
<v Speaker 3>adderall is one carbon atom away from </v>
<v Speaker 3>meth.</v>

1343
01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:29.300
<v Speaker 3>But here's the flip side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Meth is one carbon away from adderall.</v>

1344
01:07:29.900 --> 01:07:32.030
<v Speaker 3>So this whole idea that math,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

1345
01:07:32.031 --> 01:07:37.031
<v Speaker 3>back to pharmacological determinism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that meth is a drug that turns you into </v>

1346
01:07:37.031 --> 01:07:40.691
<v Speaker 3>a toothless,</v>
<v Speaker 3>insane white trash guys stabbing the </v>

1347
01:07:40.691 --> 01:07:44.561
<v Speaker 3>walls with the cleaver.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Looking for people that are hiding and </v>

1348
01:07:44.561 --> 01:07:44.630
<v Speaker 3>whispering secret messages or something </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>

1349
01:07:44.990 --> 01:07:49.510
<v Speaker 3>like this is just a stereotype that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>have created.</v>

1350
01:07:49.511 --> 01:07:54.511
<v Speaker 3>Of course there are people like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the reality is that these stimulants</v>

1351
01:07:55.351 --> 01:07:58.080
<v Speaker 3>have an ambiguous potential for all </v>
<v Speaker 3>sorts of things.</v>

1352
01:07:58.170 --> 01:08:00.180
<v Speaker 3>Some people use low doses of </v>
<v Speaker 3>methamphetamine,</v>

1353
01:08:00.330 --> 01:08:01.250
<v Speaker 3>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>methamphetamine,</v>

1354
01:08:01.251 --> 01:08:06.251
<v Speaker 3>a schedule too because to this day it </v>
<v Speaker 3>can be and is prescribed as a treatment </v>

1355
01:08:06.251 --> 01:08:08.850
<v Speaker 3>for Adhd in addition to amphetamine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is adderall.</v>

1356
01:08:08.910 --> 01:08:10.620
<v Speaker 3>What do they call it when they </v>
<v Speaker 3>prescribe?</v>

1357
01:08:10.621 --> 01:08:14.310
<v Speaker 3>It does and is the brand name for </v>
<v Speaker 3>methamphetamine?</v>

1358
01:08:15.660 --> 01:08:16.070
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1359
01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:20.420
<v Speaker 1>adderall is the brand name fettuccine </v>
<v Speaker 1>and their vet and I've tried both drugs,</v>

1360
01:08:20.421 --> 01:08:22.610
<v Speaker 1>both amphetamine and methamphetamine and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're very,</v>

1361
01:08:22.611 --> 01:08:27.611
<v Speaker 1>very similar drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's not to say that either are </v>

1362
01:08:27.611 --> 01:08:28.670
<v Speaker 1>good or bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a factual statement that if in</v>

1363
01:08:28.671 --> 01:08:33.671
<v Speaker 1>a double blind placebo controlled or not</v>
<v Speaker 1>even placebo control just a double blind</v>

1364
01:08:34.011 --> 01:08:35.230
<v Speaker 1>trial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that I could,</v>

1365
01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:40.320
<v Speaker 1>it could differentiate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could also help obese patients lose </v>

1366
01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:40.490
<v Speaker 1>weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you know that?</v>

1367
01:08:40.491 --> 01:08:45.491
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people who think trump </v>

1368
01:08:45.491 --> 01:08:45.491
<v Speaker 1>is on diet pills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1369
01:08:45.491 --> 01:08:45.491
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On a diagonal appropriate.</v>

1370
01:08:45.491 --> 01:08:46.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1371
01:08:46.041 --> 01:08:48.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that he used to be on one of the,</v>

1372
01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:51.290
<v Speaker 1>one of the elements of fen phen phen </v>
<v Speaker 1>phen,</v>

1373
01:08:51.291 --> 01:08:52.010
<v Speaker 1>phen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>phen,</v>

1374
01:08:52.011 --> 01:08:55.370
<v Speaker 1>fenfluramine phentermine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1375
01:08:55.371 --> 01:09:00.371
<v Speaker 1>there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some journalists that we even talked </v>

1376
01:09:00.371 --> 01:09:00.371
<v Speaker 1>about the DOJ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We saved this.</v>

1377
01:09:00.371 --> 01:09:01.520
<v Speaker 1>We have it on a folder now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you say,</v>

1378
01:09:01.521 --> 01:09:01.850
<v Speaker 1>Jamie?</v>

1379
01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:04.760
<v Speaker 1>I've been hit up messages about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Journalists,</v>

1380
01:09:04.761 --> 01:09:07.200
<v Speaker 1>that he might be sketchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sketchy or something like that,</v>

1381
01:09:07.970 --> 01:09:12.970
<v Speaker 1>but even if he were on [inaudible] or </v>
<v Speaker 1>fenfluramine or phentermine or fen </v>

1382
01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:16.580
<v Speaker 1>metrazole or any of these substances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what,</v>

1383
01:09:17.030 --> 01:09:18.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the question is,</v>

1384
01:09:18.811 --> 01:09:22.610
<v Speaker 1>is judgment compromised because he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>hopped up on speed,</v>

1385
01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:25.240
<v Speaker 1>was judgment seems compromised </v>
<v Speaker 1>regardless that?</v>

1386
01:09:25.250 --> 01:09:27.200
<v Speaker 1>Is that why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1387
01:09:27.201 --> 01:09:30.890
<v Speaker 1>probably not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it could be why he gets so much shit</v>

1388
01:09:30.891 --> 01:09:32.720
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1389
01:09:32.721 --> 01:09:34.490
<v Speaker 1>you remember when during the you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1390
01:09:34.491 --> 01:09:36.500
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just don't want to compliment them.</v>

1391
01:09:36.501 --> 01:09:37.310
<v Speaker 1>And I understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1392
01:09:37.311 --> 01:09:37.600
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1393
01:09:37.670 --> 01:09:40.160
<v Speaker 1>that's not why it's again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's this idea.</v>

1394
01:09:40.700 --> 01:09:43.340
<v Speaker 1>There's a certain exculpatory value that</v>
<v Speaker 1>drugs have.</v>

1395
01:09:43.341 --> 01:09:44.960
<v Speaker 1>People make the same arguments about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hitler.</v>

1396
01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:50.200
<v Speaker 1>Hitler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was just high on speed that explains </v>

1397
01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:50.200
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Nazis,</v>

1398
01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:50.200
<v Speaker 1>they were just high on speed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That explains it.</v>

1399
01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:51.590
<v Speaker 1>But what value does it really have?</v>

1400
01:09:51.590 --> 01:09:53.090
<v Speaker 1>The same thing with Anthony Bordain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll say,</v>

1401
01:09:53.091 --> 01:09:54.740
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drugs were found in his system.</v>

1402
01:09:54.741 --> 01:09:56.720
<v Speaker 1>Postmortem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what?</v>

1403
01:09:56.750 --> 01:09:59.570
<v Speaker 1>What if they had been then what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1404
01:09:59.571 --> 01:10:04.571
<v Speaker 1>the idea is that he might have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiencing a fucked up state of mind </v>

1405
01:10:05.451 --> 01:10:09.170
<v Speaker 1>because of some drug that made him make </v>
<v Speaker 1>a poor choice and take his own life.</v>

1406
01:10:10.310 --> 01:10:13.070
<v Speaker 1>But you wouldn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't know why he did it.</v>

1407
01:10:13.550 --> 01:10:18.550
<v Speaker 1>Is that what you're saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't explain anything really </v>

1408
01:10:18.550 --> 01:10:18.560
<v Speaker 1>because you still wouldn't know his </v>
<v Speaker 1>internal state.</v>

1409
01:10:18.561 --> 01:10:20.720
<v Speaker 1>It would just be you're projecting an </v>
<v Speaker 1>assumption.</v>

1410
01:10:20.810 --> 01:10:25.810
<v Speaker 1>So what if there were a small amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>heroin in his blood at the time of his </v>

1411
01:10:25.810 --> 01:10:29.171
<v Speaker 1>death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you would assume that he had </v>

1412
01:10:29.171 --> 01:10:31.871
<v Speaker 1>relapsed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was so ashamed of his relapse that he </v>

1413
01:10:31.871 --> 01:10:34.541
<v Speaker 1>then decided to kill himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the reality is we can't make those </v>

1414
01:10:34.541 --> 01:10:38.681
<v Speaker 1>sorts of assessments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know other people's internal </v>

1415
01:10:38.681 --> 01:10:38.681
<v Speaker 1>states.</v>

1416
01:10:38.681 --> 01:10:38.750
<v Speaker 1>We don't even know what these things do </v>
<v Speaker 1>to other people.</v>

1417
01:10:38.751 --> 01:10:43.751
<v Speaker 1>We don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we do know that some things like </v>

1418
01:10:43.751 --> 01:10:46.121
<v Speaker 1>abilify and some other Ssri eyes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>even some anti anxiety medication had </v>

1419
01:10:47.091 --> 01:10:51.710
<v Speaker 1>been strongly linked to suicidal </v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts and in fact there were actually</v>

1420
01:10:51.740 --> 01:10:54.590
<v Speaker 1>listed as some side effects for a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>these drugs.</v>

1421
01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:55.790
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you think that.</v>

1422
01:10:56.060 --> 01:11:01.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know correlation does not equal </v>

1423
01:11:01.060 --> 01:11:03.011
<v Speaker 1>causation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but don't you think that that's worth </v>

1424
01:11:03.011 --> 01:11:03.011
<v Speaker 1>considering and it's something to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussed.</v>

1425
01:11:03.011 --> 01:11:06.581
<v Speaker 1>It's worth considering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would be careful about assigning </v>

1426
01:11:06.581 --> 01:11:07.130
<v Speaker 1>too much value to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what people tend to do the same</v>

1427
01:11:07.131 --> 01:11:08.240
<v Speaker 1>thing with columbine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll say,</v>

1428
01:11:08.241 --> 01:11:10.280
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was on that antidepressant.</v>

1429
01:11:10.281 --> 01:11:12.860
<v Speaker 1>That's why is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why does it really explain it?</v>

1430
01:11:12.861 --> 01:11:14.010
<v Speaker 1>Because a hell of a lot</v>

1431
01:11:14.010 --> 01:11:16.860
<v Speaker 3>of people that take those same drugs and</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't kill all of their classmates.</v>

1432
01:11:16.861 --> 01:11:17.770
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1433
01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:18.810
<v Speaker 3>For sure.</v>

1434
01:11:19.090 --> 01:11:24.090
<v Speaker 4>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it also could be a factor and this </v>

1435
01:11:24.090 --> 01:11:26.020
<v Speaker 4>is not something that I think we should </v>
<v Speaker 4>avoid considering.</v>

1436
01:11:26.350 --> 01:11:29.220
<v Speaker 4>I think it should be discussed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

1437
01:11:29.221 --> 01:11:34.221
<v Speaker 4>I agree with you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think we're trying to look at </v>

1438
01:11:34.221 --> 01:11:34.221
<v Speaker 4>things binary,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1439
01:11:34.221 --> 01:11:36.840
<v Speaker 4>We're looking at things in terms of like</v>
<v Speaker 4>on or off black or white.</v>

1440
01:11:36.841 --> 01:11:39.870
<v Speaker 4>One or zero and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just don't think drugs work that way.</v>

1441
01:11:40.230 --> 01:11:41.370
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think you agree.</v>

1442
01:11:41.371 --> 01:11:44.160
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The speed thing is curious to me because</v>

1443
01:11:44.161 --> 01:11:48.000
<v Speaker 4>one of the side effects of these drugs </v>
<v Speaker 4>is impulsive,</v>

1444
01:11:48.060 --> 01:11:53.060
<v Speaker 4>irrational behavior and extreme </v>
<v Speaker 4>confidence in oneself.</v>

1445
01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:56.190
<v Speaker 4>Like this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is right.</v>

1446
01:11:56.191 --> 01:11:58.590
<v Speaker 4>This is what we always think of people </v>
<v Speaker 4>that are hopped up on speed.</v>

1447
01:11:58.950 --> 01:12:02.190
<v Speaker 4>People that have a coke confidence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1448
01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:05.490
<v Speaker 4>confidence is a real phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When people do cocaine,</v>

1449
01:12:05.491 --> 01:12:09.150
<v Speaker 4>they feel very confident about </v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves and they save ridiculous shit</v>

1450
01:12:09.151 --> 01:12:10.890
<v Speaker 4>to people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the question is,</v>

1451
01:12:10.891 --> 01:12:13.890
<v Speaker 4>is that really what's happening?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If they have I gave coke to you,</v>

1452
01:12:14.220 --> 01:12:18.750
<v Speaker 4>would you start acting irrationally and </v>
<v Speaker 4>feeling extremely confident yourself?</v>

1453
01:12:18.751 --> 01:12:23.751
<v Speaker 4>Or is it just accentuating a problem </v>
<v Speaker 4>that already exists in the person's </v>

1454
01:12:23.811 --> 01:12:24.530
<v Speaker 4>personality?</v>

1455
01:12:24.630 --> 01:12:27.120
<v Speaker 3>Both.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably a combination of the two,</v>

1456
01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:30.300
<v Speaker 3>but the other thing is even if he has </v>
<v Speaker 3>been using this stuff for decades,</v>

1457
01:12:30.301 --> 01:12:32.220
<v Speaker 3>he's probably tolerant to it and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>not.</v>

1458
01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:37.280
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it would explain his </v>
<v Speaker 3>behavior why thing is giving them </v>

1459
01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:38.130
<v Speaker 3>energy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's been like this for so long though.</v>

1460
01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:38.580
<v Speaker 3>This.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1461
01:12:38.581 --> 01:12:41.430
<v Speaker 3>this is a long history of this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>behavior.</v>

1462
01:12:41.490 --> 01:12:42.930
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this was what the journalist that talked</v>

1463
01:12:42.931 --> 01:12:47.931
<v Speaker 3>about that he had been on this stuff for</v>
<v Speaker 3>a long time and that there was a actual </v>

1464
01:12:47.931 --> 01:12:51.980
<v Speaker 3>Dwayne Reed pharmacy in New York where </v>
<v Speaker 3>he described where he got the </v>

1465
01:12:51.980 --> 01:12:55.461
<v Speaker 3>prescription filled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People were doing the same thing with </v>

1466
01:12:55.461 --> 01:12:57.741
<v Speaker 3>his finasteride as well though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I found that particularly obnoxious </v>

1467
01:12:57.741 --> 01:13:00.060
<v Speaker 3>finasteride is pizza pizza.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they were saying,</v>

1468
01:13:00.450 --> 01:13:03.060
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's on finasteride and that explains,</v>

1469
01:13:03.061 --> 01:13:08.061
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a fair or that explains this because </v>

1470
01:13:08.061 --> 01:13:08.061
<v Speaker 3>it does this or that to your libido.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>

1471
01:13:08.061 --> 01:13:11.960
<v Speaker 3>it's like I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or not at all,</v>

1472
01:13:12.020 --> 01:13:16.490
<v Speaker 3>or let's give him some credit for being </v>
<v Speaker 3>a human being with freewill.</v>

1473
01:13:16.491 --> 01:13:21.491
<v Speaker 3>That makes choices on his own that </v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't entirely mediated by what </v>

1474
01:13:21.491 --> 01:13:21.530
<v Speaker 3>pharmaceuticals he uses.</v>

1475
01:13:21.720 --> 01:13:26.720
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>finasteride also has side effects of </v>

1476
01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:28.941
<v Speaker 4>depression and we went over this </v>
<v Speaker 4>yesterday with my friend Ari who was </v>

1477
01:13:28.941 --> 01:13:33.440
<v Speaker 4>really depressed at one point in time </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it coincided with his use of </v>

1478
01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:33.440
<v Speaker 4>finasteride,</v>

1479
01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:34.000
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1480
01:13:34.180 --> 01:13:36.430
<v Speaker 3>I've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not very common.</v>

1481
01:13:36.490 --> 01:13:38.290
<v Speaker 3>It does occur,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not uncommon.</v>

1482
01:13:39.100 --> 01:13:41.110
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But for the person that</v>

1483
01:13:41.590 --> 01:13:44.890
<v Speaker 4>does get those side effects,</v>
<v Speaker 4>saying that it's not common,</v>

1484
01:13:44.891 --> 01:13:46.360
<v Speaker 4>doesn't really offer any comfort.</v>

1485
01:13:47.300 --> 01:13:48.210
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1486
01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:49.230
<v Speaker 3>Call.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1487
01:13:49.980 --> 01:13:53.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm one of the lucky ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm one of the lucky ones,</v>

1488
01:13:53.531 --> 01:13:56.440
<v Speaker 3>ones that jump off a bridge to get my </v>
<v Speaker 3>hair to grow back.</v>

1489
01:13:56.560 --> 01:13:59.640
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reason that I'm so opinionated about</v>

1490
01:13:59.641 --> 01:14:02.220
<v Speaker 3>this particular issue is because you see</v>
<v Speaker 3>it time and time again.</v>

1491
01:14:02.221 --> 01:14:03.180
<v Speaker 3>It never stops.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1492
01:14:03.181 --> 01:14:05.610
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you're familiar with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jeffrey Macdonald murder case.</v>

1493
01:14:05.670 --> 01:14:07.240
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm super fascinating.</v>

1494
01:14:07.241 --> 01:14:09.170
<v Speaker 3>You probably have read about it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>forgotten about it.</v>

1495
01:14:09.171 --> 01:14:14.171
<v Speaker 3>It was a big thing and maybe 1970,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was this military doctor,</v>

1496
01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:16.780
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's credentialed.</v>

1497
01:14:16.781 --> 01:14:18.940
<v Speaker 3>The perfect man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did everything right,</v>

1498
01:14:18.941 --> 01:14:20.950
<v Speaker 3>perfect family,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything beautiful.</v>

1499
01:14:21.070 --> 01:14:26.070
<v Speaker 3>And then one night he goes to sleep and </v>
<v Speaker 3>claims that is right after the Manson </v>

1500
01:14:27.281 --> 01:14:31.450
<v Speaker 3>murders claims that these hippies walk </v>
<v Speaker 3>into the house saying,</v>

1501
01:14:31.660 --> 01:14:33.760
<v Speaker 3>kill the pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Acid is groovy,</v>

1502
01:14:33.970 --> 01:14:35.560
<v Speaker 3>kill the pigs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>acid is groovy.</v>

1503
01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:40.800
<v Speaker 3>And then just brutally massacre his </v>
<v Speaker 3>entire family and out of nowhere,</v>

1504
01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:42.940
<v Speaker 3>out of nowhere.</v>

1505
01:14:42.970 --> 01:14:44.640
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

1506
01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:49.840
<v Speaker 3>and it's a long and complicated story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he went to prison.</v>

1507
01:14:50.290 --> 01:14:55.290
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that he is guilty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but people had to find an explanation </v>

1508
01:14:55.290 --> 01:14:57.700
<v Speaker 3>for why and you don't think he's guilty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he's guilty.</v>

1509
01:14:57.701 --> 01:15:02.701
<v Speaker 3>He had no motive and there were an </v>
<v Speaker 3>investigation was botched and so you </v>

1510
01:15:02.701 --> 01:15:03.250
<v Speaker 3>think someone came into his house and </v>
<v Speaker 3>did that.</v>

1511
01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:07.330
<v Speaker 3>He was accused of but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but because he had no motive,</v>

1512
01:15:07.810 --> 01:15:12.810
<v Speaker 3>people had to construct a motive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had to concoct a reason that this </v>

1513
01:15:12.810 --> 01:15:14.800
<v Speaker 3>doctor would have murdered his entire </v>
<v Speaker 3>family.</v>

1514
01:15:14.860 --> 01:15:16.190
<v Speaker 3>And so what's a good reason?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1515
01:15:16.450 --> 01:15:17.980
<v Speaker 3>amphetamine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'd been using this,</v>

1516
01:15:17.981 --> 01:15:21.460
<v Speaker 3>a amphetamine containing diet pills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that explains it all right.</v>

1517
01:15:22.150 --> 01:15:24.280
<v Speaker 3>But it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a terrible explanation.</v>

1518
01:15:24.281 --> 01:15:26.500
<v Speaker 3>People use amphetamine all the time </v>
<v Speaker 3>without killing their family.</v>

1519
01:15:26.501 --> 01:15:28.780
<v Speaker 3>So I just want to be very careful about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1520
01:15:28.781 --> 01:15:30.670
<v Speaker 3>do these things play a role in human </v>
<v Speaker 3>behavior?</v>

1521
01:15:30.670 --> 01:15:33.340
<v Speaker 3>Of course they do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but do they determine human behavior?</v>

1522
01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:35.260
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a very good point.</v>

1523
01:15:35.740 --> 01:15:37.660
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of factors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's just,</v>

1524
01:15:37.990 --> 01:15:40.270
<v Speaker 3>it's messy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Being a person is missing.</v>

1525
01:15:40.271 --> 01:15:41.340
<v Speaker 3>It's very complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1526
01:15:41.341 --> 01:15:44.290
<v Speaker 3>you're a different person at noon then </v>
<v Speaker 3>you are at 7:00</v>

1527
01:15:44.290 --> 01:15:44.920
<v Speaker 3>PM,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>

1528
01:15:44.980 --> 01:15:46.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1529
01:15:46.490 --> 01:15:49.900
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

1530
01:15:51.340 --> 01:15:56.340
<v Speaker 3>it's so complicated and the more </v>
<v Speaker 3>limitations we put on research and the </v>

1531
01:15:58.781 --> 01:16:01.510
<v Speaker 3>more stigma we put on the use of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

1532
01:16:01.810 --> 01:16:04.240
<v Speaker 3>the more murky these waters are going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be.</v>

1533
01:16:04.810 --> 01:16:07.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think people don't even appreciate</v>

1534
01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:10.480
<v Speaker 3>the extent to which all these drugs have</v>
<v Speaker 3>been made illegal.</v>

1535
01:16:10.481 --> 01:16:15.481
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone's where cannabis is a schedule </v>

1536
01:16:15.481 --> 01:16:15.481
<v Speaker 3>on LSD,</v>
<v Speaker 3>psilocybin,</v>

1537
01:16:15.481 --> 01:16:16.180
<v Speaker 3>Mtma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the list is long.</v>

1538
01:16:16.210 --> 01:16:21.210
<v Speaker 3>It's hundreds and hundreds of chemicals </v>
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of these chemicals are </v>

1539
01:16:21.210 --> 01:16:23.470
<v Speaker 3>chemicals with no supporters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one's fighting for them.</v>

1540
01:16:23.590 --> 01:16:27.310
<v Speaker 3>There's a substance called two cn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of shoguns creations.</v>

1541
01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:29.380
<v Speaker 3>They just threw it in schedule and no </v>
<v Speaker 3>one uses it.</v>

1542
01:16:29.381 --> 01:16:32.260
<v Speaker 3>If you scour the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be surprised if you could find three</v>

1543
01:16:32.261 --> 01:16:34.960
<v Speaker 3>reports of people using to cn totally </v>
<v Speaker 3>unheard of,</v>

1544
01:16:35.140 --> 01:16:37.750
<v Speaker 3>but they just throw it in schedule one </v>
<v Speaker 3>because why the hell not.</v>

1545
01:16:37.930 --> 01:16:40.510
<v Speaker 3>No one's going to stand up for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the end of two CN.</v>

1546
01:16:40.570 --> 01:16:42.490
<v Speaker 3>But they miss a lot of shit too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1547
01:16:42.491 --> 01:16:45.090
<v Speaker 3>Like they miss five methoxy muscle trip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To me,</v>

1548
01:16:45.110 --> 01:16:46.210
<v Speaker 3>they missed that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1549
01:16:46.220 --> 01:16:48.420
<v Speaker 3>that was made illegal in 2011.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1550
01:16:48.850 --> 01:16:51.820
<v Speaker 3>For 1970 when everything else got thrown</v>
<v Speaker 3>into the mix,</v>

1551
01:16:51.821 --> 01:16:53.680
<v Speaker 3>they made it illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bought that shit.</v>

1552
01:16:53.710 --> 01:16:55.210
<v Speaker 3>Used to be able to buy it online.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1553
01:16:55.211 --> 01:16:56.110
<v Speaker 3>so did I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1554
01:16:56.111 --> 01:17:01.111
<v Speaker 3>It was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could buy a fucking jug of it then </v>

1555
01:17:01.111 --> 01:17:01.120
<v Speaker 3>get the whole city high buyadol online.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1556
01:17:01.121 --> 01:17:04.030
<v Speaker 3>because it was never popular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so how do they make it illegal?</v>

1557
01:17:04.450 --> 01:17:05.650
<v Speaker 3>How do they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do they do that?</v>

1558
01:17:06.370 --> 01:17:11.370
<v Speaker 3>They don't need any reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can simply say that it has abuse </v>

1559
01:17:11.370 --> 01:17:12.320
<v Speaker 3>potential and make it illegal and if no </v>
<v Speaker 3>one opposes it,</v>

1560
01:17:12.321 --> 01:17:17.321
<v Speaker 3>then it becomes illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how this list has gotten so long </v>

1561
01:17:17.321 --> 01:17:19.871
<v Speaker 3>that you have all these people fighting </v>
<v Speaker 3>for the legality of cannabis and these </v>

1562
01:17:19.871 --> 01:17:20.150
<v Speaker 3>other substances that are known to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>therapeutic potential,</v>

1563
01:17:20.151 --> 01:17:25.151
<v Speaker 3>but these other more obscure substances </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are really only a concern to </v>

1564
01:17:25.151 --> 01:17:28.811
<v Speaker 3>scientists who are very seriously </v>
<v Speaker 3>disinclined to break the law for the </v>

1565
01:17:29.751 --> 01:17:32.190
<v Speaker 3>sake of the research.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Drug users don't care about breaking the</v>

1566
01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:35.150
<v Speaker 3>law.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Scientists are very unlikely because the</v>

1567
01:17:35.151 --> 01:17:38.840
<v Speaker 3>whole purpose of science is to publish </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you can't publish if you committed a</v>

1568
01:17:38.841 --> 01:17:43.841
<v Speaker 3>crime in the context of your research,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so scientists are dramatically limited </v>

1569
01:17:44.690 --> 01:17:49.690
<v Speaker 3>by the prohibition of these substances </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's the obscure ones that end up </v>

1570
01:17:49.690 --> 01:17:50.360
<v Speaker 3>actually making a big difference.</v>

1571
01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:55.360
<v Speaker 3>Not so much clinically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in terms of actually understanding </v>

1572
01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:55.370
<v Speaker 3>the mechanism of these substances,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the structure,</v>

1573
01:17:55.371 --> 01:17:56.570
<v Speaker 3>activity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>relationships,</v>

1574
01:17:56.870 --> 01:17:59.700
<v Speaker 3>the neuropharmacology yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

1575
01:18:00.020 --> 01:18:05.020
<v Speaker 3>the stigma on psychedelic use and and </v>
<v Speaker 3>even studying them has led so many </v>

1576
01:18:07.820 --> 01:18:12.820
<v Speaker 3>doctors or scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>researchers that would be inclined to </v>

1577
01:18:12.820 --> 01:18:14.240
<v Speaker 3>want to do research on these particular </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

1578
01:18:14.570 --> 01:18:19.570
<v Speaker 3>They avoid them because it could be </v>
<v Speaker 3>incredibly damaging to their careers and</v>

1579
01:18:19.731 --> 01:18:24.731
<v Speaker 3>it's bureaucratic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there was a group at Columbia </v>

1580
01:18:24.731 --> 01:18:27.401
<v Speaker 3>that was doing really fascinating </v>
<v Speaker 3>research on the drug Ibogaine and </v>

1581
01:18:27.401 --> 01:18:31.270
<v Speaker 3>Parkinson's disease and the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was speaking with the head of this </v>

1582
01:18:31.270 --> 01:18:34.351
<v Speaker 3>study and he was saying how obnoxious it</v>
<v Speaker 3>was to have the government common way.</v>

1583
01:18:35.091 --> 01:18:39.650
<v Speaker 3>His vial of Ibogaine every day and </v>
<v Speaker 3>monitors logs and you know,</v>

1584
01:18:39.651 --> 01:18:41.660
<v Speaker 3>this guy is a really serious researcher.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not gonna.</v>

1585
01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:44.750
<v Speaker 3>If you were to get high,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not going to get high off this tiny</v>

1586
01:18:44.751 --> 01:18:49.751
<v Speaker 3>supply of government mandated or </v>
<v Speaker 3>government sanctioned Ibogaine that was </v>

1587
01:18:50.871 --> 01:18:52.640
<v Speaker 3>supplied to him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

1588
01:18:52.670 --> 01:18:53.390
<v Speaker 3>but they give.</v>

1589
01:18:53.390 --> 01:18:58.390
<v Speaker 3>These people are really hard time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They make them buy a very expensive </v>

1590
01:18:58.390 --> 01:19:01.691
<v Speaker 3>safe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They do all this stuff that these are </v>

1591
01:19:01.691 --> 01:19:04.961
<v Speaker 3>the last people to abuse the substances </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they are the ones that are hurt the </v>

1592
01:19:04.961 --> 01:19:05.570
<v Speaker 3>most severely except for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>

1593
01:19:05.571 --> 01:19:10.571
<v Speaker 3>the people that go to prison,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're the ones that are hurt the most </v>

1594
01:19:10.571 --> 01:19:10.571
<v Speaker 3>severely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1595
01:19:10.571 --> 01:19:13.541
<v Speaker 3>It's a crazy thing to think that people </v>
<v Speaker 3>are going to recreationally use </v>

1596
01:19:13.541 --> 01:19:14.930
<v Speaker 3>Ibogaine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the weirder ones.</v>

1597
01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:16.610
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's totally bizarre.</v>

1598
01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:18.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm.</v>

1599
01:19:18.980 --> 01:19:23.980
<v Speaker 3>And Ibogaine is a drug with so much </v>
<v Speaker 3>potential for those people that are </v>

1600
01:19:23.980 --> 01:19:24.050
<v Speaker 3>aware of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I began.</v>

1601
01:19:24.051 --> 01:19:28.190
<v Speaker 3>It's typically only discussed as a drug </v>
<v Speaker 3>that treats addiction to opioids,</v>

1602
01:19:28.191 --> 01:19:29.420
<v Speaker 3>which is very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very important,</v>

1603
01:19:29.421 --> 01:19:34.421
<v Speaker 3>especially now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's the tip of the iceberg with </v>

1604
01:19:34.421 --> 01:19:37.151
<v Speaker 3>Ibogaine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has one of the most complex </v>

1605
01:19:37.151 --> 01:19:37.151
<v Speaker 3>pharmacology's of any drug I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>studied.</v>

1606
01:19:37.151 --> 01:19:38.600
<v Speaker 3>There's almost nothing it does not do.</v>

1607
01:19:38.920 --> 01:19:39.480
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1608
01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:43.550
<v Speaker 3>you have the Alpha three Beta four </v>
<v Speaker 3>nicotinic acetylcholine receptor,</v>

1609
01:19:43.551 --> 01:19:47.030
<v Speaker 3>which is also the target of Welbutrin </v>
<v Speaker 3>and has a kind of smoking cessation,</v>

1610
01:19:47.060 --> 01:19:52.060
<v Speaker 3>anti addictive effect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you have really high affinity </v>

1611
01:19:52.060 --> 01:19:52.940
<v Speaker 3>relative to the other receptors for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>MMDA receptors,</v>

1612
01:19:52.941 --> 01:19:56.990
<v Speaker 3>so as academy and type effect and as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>classical psychedelic effect of the five</v>

1613
01:19:56.991 --> 01:20:00.020
<v Speaker 3>ht two a receptor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then it's a dopamine reuptake inhibitor,</v>

1614
01:20:00.021 --> 01:20:05.021
<v Speaker 3>Serotonin reuptake inhibitor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just goes on and then it releases </v>

1615
01:20:05.021 --> 01:20:07.991
<v Speaker 3>this protein bdnf,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is considered one of the most </v>

1616
01:20:07.991 --> 01:20:08.700
<v Speaker 3>important proteins in treatment of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Parkinson's disease.</v>

1617
01:20:08.701 --> 01:20:13.701
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the only things that is able</v>
<v Speaker 3>to cause a regrowth of dopaminergic </v>

1618
01:20:13.701 --> 01:20:13.740
<v Speaker 3>neurons and people that have </v>
<v Speaker 3>Parkinson's.</v>

1619
01:20:13.860 --> 01:20:18.860
<v Speaker 3>So this is like really fascinating stuff</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just in schedule one scientists </v>

1620
01:20:18.860 --> 01:20:19.770
<v Speaker 3>can't work with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is a tragedy.</v>

1621
01:20:22.300 --> 01:20:25.220
<v Speaker 2>It is a tragedy and it's also so </v>
<v Speaker 2>effective.</v>

1622
01:20:25.221 --> 01:20:30.221
<v Speaker 2>I know so many people that have gone to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mexico and go into these clinics and </v>

1623
01:20:30.221 --> 01:20:33.380
<v Speaker 2>done one Ibogaine session for 24 hours </v>
<v Speaker 2>and come out of it.</v>

1624
01:20:33.381 --> 01:20:38.381
<v Speaker 2>A totally different person come out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>it with a complete new perspective on </v>

1625
01:20:38.381 --> 01:20:43.360
<v Speaker 2>even why they were using whatever they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were using in the first place in a way </v>

1626
01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:47.501
<v Speaker 2>that they didn't do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not only does it help eliminate the </v>

1627
01:20:47.501 --> 01:20:49.010
<v Speaker 2>addictive properties and the connection </v>
<v Speaker 2>that your body has to those substances,</v>

1628
01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:54.160
<v Speaker 2>but it also allows you to reexamined why</v>
<v Speaker 2>you went down that road in the first </v>

1629
01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:54.160
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

1630
01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:54.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1631
01:20:54.521 --> 01:20:59.521
<v Speaker 3>And there was a sort of pharmaceutical </v>
<v Speaker 3>push to develop non psychedelic </v>

1632
01:20:59.860 --> 01:21:03.430
<v Speaker 3>derivatives of Ibogaine that would </v>
<v Speaker 3>retain the anti addictive properties,</v>

1633
01:21:03.580 --> 01:21:08.580
<v Speaker 3>which sounds like a good idea in theory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but so they created this drug called 18 </v>

1634
01:21:08.580 --> 01:21:13.391
<v Speaker 3>mc and it wasn't psychedelic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then it also lacked some of these </v>

1635
01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:16.600
<v Speaker 3>neurotrophic factor releasing properties</v>
<v Speaker 3>of Ibogaine.</v>

1636
01:21:16.750 --> 01:21:21.750
<v Speaker 3>But really the bottom line is that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't deny the fact that the </v>

1637
01:21:21.750 --> 01:21:26.371
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic activity of these substances</v>
<v Speaker 3>is therapeutic psychotherapeutic in and </v>

1638
01:21:26.371 --> 01:21:26.950
<v Speaker 3>of itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1639
01:21:26.951 --> 01:21:31.951
<v Speaker 3>I had a friend who was severely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>severely addicted to heroin and he </v>

1640
01:21:31.951 --> 01:21:34.360
<v Speaker 3>traveled to the Netherlands to take </v>
<v Speaker 3>Ibogaine and,</v>

1641
01:21:34.361 --> 01:21:35.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>took the drug,</v>

1642
01:21:35.770 --> 01:21:40.060
<v Speaker 3>was going into the experience and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>started feeling this intense craving for</v>

1643
01:21:40.061 --> 01:21:41.580
<v Speaker 3>heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

1644
01:21:41.730 --> 01:21:46.730
<v Speaker 3>and started looking through his bags to </v>
<v Speaker 3>see if he somehow had forgotten about a </v>

1645
01:21:46.730 --> 01:21:48.850
<v Speaker 3>little bit of heroin that could just get</v>
<v Speaker 3>them through the day.</v>

1646
01:21:48.851 --> 01:21:53.851
<v Speaker 3>And then he goes into his bag and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>finds a small bag of heroin and snorts </v>

1647
01:21:54.041 --> 01:21:55.210
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then it's like,</v>

1648
01:21:55.480 --> 01:21:58.810
<v Speaker 3>I traveled all the way to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Netherlands to do this.</v>

1649
01:21:58.930 --> 01:22:01.030
<v Speaker 3>This was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a failure.</v>

1650
01:22:01.031 --> 01:22:03.700
<v Speaker 3>I'm relapsing after all of this money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all this work.</v>

1651
01:22:03.701 --> 01:22:05.200
<v Speaker 3>I have no self control.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a terrible,</v>

1652
01:22:05.201 --> 01:22:10.201
<v Speaker 3>terrible person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why can't I just stop and then realize </v>

1653
01:22:10.201 --> 01:22:10.900
<v Speaker 3>that the whole thing was a holy nation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was no heroin.</v>

1654
01:22:10.901 --> 01:22:14.110
<v Speaker 3>He hallucinated his own relapse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

1655
01:22:19.140 --> 01:22:24.140
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was your experience with the ivory </v>

1656
01:22:24.140 --> 01:22:24.250
<v Speaker 3>game?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never taken high doses.</v>

1657
01:22:24.251 --> 01:22:27.460
<v Speaker 3>The most I've ever taken is 50 </v>
<v Speaker 3>milligrams of this ineffective dose.</v>

1658
01:22:27.970 --> 01:22:32.970
<v Speaker 3>It really depends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's sort of move toward microdosing </v>

1659
01:22:32.970 --> 01:22:36.340
<v Speaker 3>Ibogaine because it actually does have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>cardio toxic effect,</v>

1660
01:22:36.341 --> 01:22:41.341
<v Speaker 3>especially at higher doses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So people are looking into ways of </v>

1661
01:22:41.341 --> 01:22:45.930
<v Speaker 3>reducing that cardio toxicity by using </v>
<v Speaker 3>it at lower doses for longer periods of </v>

1662
01:22:45.930 --> 01:22:46.460
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

1663
01:22:46.461 --> 01:22:51.461
<v Speaker 3>this is something that has to do with </v>
<v Speaker 3>prohibition because in a this </v>

1664
01:22:51.461 --> 01:22:52.850
<v Speaker 3>prohibition market,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you are addicted to heroin,</v>

1665
01:22:52.851 --> 01:22:56.330
<v Speaker 3>you go to Mexico or you go to Canada and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go to an Ibogaine clinic,</v>

1666
01:22:56.331 --> 01:22:59.570
<v Speaker 3>you need to get as much bang for your </v>
<v Speaker 3>buck as quickly as possible.</v>

1667
01:22:59.571 --> 01:23:04.571
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to stay there for two </v>
<v Speaker 3>months of treatment because most people </v>

1668
01:23:04.571 --> 01:23:05.440
<v Speaker 3>have lives and can't afford to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So do you.</v>

1669
01:23:05.441 --> 01:23:07.380
<v Speaker 3>Do they give you what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is called a flood dose?</v>

1670
01:23:07.380 --> 01:23:12.380
<v Speaker 3>It's a massive dose off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>often a multi gram dose of Ibogaine </v>

1671
01:23:12.380 --> 01:23:17.100
<v Speaker 3>because it's just like a sledge hammer </v>
<v Speaker 3>that knocks you down and allows you to </v>

1672
01:23:17.100 --> 01:23:18.130
<v Speaker 3>get out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But is that the best way?</v>

1673
01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:23.280
<v Speaker 3>That's the fastest way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the most appetizing way for </v>

1674
01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:24.640
<v Speaker 3>someone that had to travel to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but is it the best?</v>

1675
01:23:24.790 --> 01:23:29.790
<v Speaker 3>Probably not because we know that at </v>
<v Speaker 3>high doses it has this potential to </v>

1676
01:23:30.591 --> 01:23:34.160
<v Speaker 3>induce cardiac arrhythmias and that can </v>
<v Speaker 3>kill and has killed.</v>

1677
01:23:34.310 --> 01:23:37.880
<v Speaker 3>So people are now looking at lower doses</v>
<v Speaker 3>over longer periods of time.</v>

1678
01:23:38.030 --> 01:23:41.180
<v Speaker 3>Which would be ideal if it were legal in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the United States,</v>

1679
01:23:41.181 --> 01:23:41.780
<v Speaker 3>I believe.</v>

1680
01:23:43.270 --> 01:23:44.080
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a,</v>

1681
01:23:44.710 --> 01:23:47.590
<v Speaker 4>it's a really interesting one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>To me it's a,</v>

1682
01:23:47.670 --> 01:23:52.670
<v Speaker 4>it's a really interesting one because </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's got such a long history of use and </v>

1683
01:23:52.781 --> 01:23:57.781
<v Speaker 4>so many people have had these very good </v>
<v Speaker 4>experiences with getting off of </v>

1684
01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.410
<v Speaker 4>addictive drugs from it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

1685
01:24:00.750 --> 01:24:04.180
<v Speaker 4>And so relatively unknown as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's something that,</v>

1686
01:24:04.181 --> 01:24:09.181
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>talk to someone like you and of course </v>

1687
01:24:09.181 --> 01:24:09.550
<v Speaker 4>you know about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I bet if we walk down the street and</v>

1688
01:24:09.551 --> 01:24:12.640
<v Speaker 4>asked 100 people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd be shocked if one of them knew about</v>

1689
01:24:12.641 --> 01:24:12.760
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1690
01:24:12.950 --> 01:24:14.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1691
01:24:14.481 --> 01:24:19.481
<v Speaker 3>Terence Mckenna would sometimes talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>about silicide been as an invention of </v>

1692
01:24:19.481 --> 01:24:22.110
<v Speaker 3>mushrooms or is technology or as being </v>
<v Speaker 3>synthetic and uh,</v>

1693
01:24:22.111 --> 01:24:25.760
<v Speaker 3>I don't really agree with that idea of </v>
<v Speaker 3>an invention of mushrooms where he would</v>

1694
01:24:25.761 --> 01:24:30.761
<v Speaker 3>sort of say like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a synthetic as a coca cola </v>

1695
01:24:30.761 --> 01:24:30.761
<v Speaker 3>bottle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is like alien technology.</v>

1696
01:24:30.761 --> 01:24:32.510
<v Speaker 3>That's how you would describe </v>
<v Speaker 3>psilocybin.</v>

1697
01:24:32.570 --> 01:24:34.280
<v Speaker 3>But in my opinion it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1698
01:24:34.340 --> 01:24:36.530
<v Speaker 3>it's a pretty simple derivative of trip </v>
<v Speaker 3>to fan.</v>

1699
01:24:36.531 --> 01:24:41.531
<v Speaker 3>You just decarboxylated methalate the </v>
<v Speaker 3>nitrogen twice and then add this </v>

1700
01:24:41.531 --> 01:24:42.170
<v Speaker 3>phosphate Ester,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1701
01:24:42.590 --> 01:24:46.010
<v Speaker 3>but Ibogaine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a crazy molecule.</v>

1702
01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:51.040
<v Speaker 3>That's like a three dimensional thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that no medicinal chemists would have </v>

1703
01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:51.970
<v Speaker 3>ever discovered that if there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1704
01:24:52.220 --> 01:24:57.220
<v Speaker 3>not to sound mystical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that strikes me as some sort of </v>

1705
01:24:57.220 --> 01:24:57.220
<v Speaker 3>plant technology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1706
01:24:57.220 --> 01:25:01.451
<v Speaker 3>it's an amazingly complicated structure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so complicated that it's almost </v>

1707
01:25:01.451 --> 01:25:02.060
<v Speaker 3>impossible to synthesize.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

1708
01:25:02.061 --> 01:25:07.061
<v Speaker 3>it can't be synthesized commercially.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the Ibogaine that people use has to </v>

1709
01:25:07.061 --> 01:25:08.510
<v Speaker 3>be extracted from plants because that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>the only way to get it.</v>

1710
01:25:08.730 --> 01:25:09.410
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1711
01:25:11.010 --> 01:25:13.120
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I first found out about it when,</v>

1712
01:25:13.750 --> 01:25:18.400
<v Speaker 4>when hunter s Thompson accused Ed Muskie</v>
<v Speaker 4>of being on it during the presidential,</v>

1713
01:25:18.401 --> 01:25:20.080
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>race of,</v>

1714
01:25:20.110 --> 01:25:21.910
<v Speaker 4>what was it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>1970 or whatever it was.</v>

1715
01:25:22.070 --> 01:25:26.200
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was a hilarious moment and a lot of</v>

1716
01:25:26.201 --> 01:25:31.201
<v Speaker 4>people I think were introduced to what </v>
<v Speaker 4>Ibogaine was by that when he said a </v>

1717
01:25:31.201 --> 01:25:32.890
<v Speaker 4>Brazilian,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which Dr had been flown in.</v>

1718
01:25:36.700 --> 01:25:39.010
<v Speaker 4>Of course it doesn't even grow in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Brazil,</v>

1719
01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:40.120
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't even make sense.</v>

1720
01:25:40.620 --> 01:25:43.210
<v Speaker 4>It's also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was hilarious when he was on the Dick</v>

1721
01:25:43.210 --> 01:25:46.150
<v Speaker 4>Cavett show and they asked him about </v>
<v Speaker 4>spreading those rumors and he's like,</v>

1722
01:25:46.151 --> 01:25:47.200
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a rumor,</v>

1723
01:25:47.660 --> 01:25:48.340
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1724
01:25:48.341 --> 01:25:50.920
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was doing this a Ibogaine.</v>

1725
01:25:50.980 --> 01:25:51.850
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1726
01:25:52.410 --> 01:25:57.410
<v Speaker 4>I know because I started the rumor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just reported factually,</v>

1727
01:25:58.410 --> 01:26:02.340
<v Speaker 4>there was a rumor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's,</v>

1728
01:26:02.341 --> 01:26:03.230
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

1729
01:26:03.260 --> 01:26:04.280
<v Speaker 4>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot</v>

1730
01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:09.280
<v Speaker 3>of these drugs that get put into various</v>
<v Speaker 3>categories and Ibogaine is one of the </v>

1731
01:26:09.921 --> 01:26:14.921
<v Speaker 3>very few that really isn't in any </v>
<v Speaker 3>category in terms of like modern </v>

1732
01:26:14.921 --> 01:26:18.851
<v Speaker 3>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the way we discuss and consider </v>

1733
01:26:18.851 --> 01:26:19.580
<v Speaker 3>these things because it's very different</v>
<v Speaker 3>structurally and logically.</v>

1734
01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:24.760
<v Speaker 3>But that the hunter s Thompson story is </v>
<v Speaker 3>really interesting because it's </v>

1735
01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:26.240
<v Speaker 3>obviously a very charming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>funny story and I'd have to know exactly</v>

1736
01:26:26.241 --> 01:26:28.610
<v Speaker 3>when it happened relative to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>scheduling of Ibogaine,</v>

1737
01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:33.760
<v Speaker 3>but that might be an example of how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's a frivolous joke that most people</v>

1738
01:26:33.891 --> 01:26:38.891
<v Speaker 3>enjoy told in the wrong climate can </v>
<v Speaker 3>result in the loss of a chemical that </v>

1739
01:26:38.891 --> 01:26:43.661
<v Speaker 3>could be good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that could save tens of thousands of </v>

1740
01:26:43.661 --> 01:26:43.910
<v Speaker 3>lives and could be a treatment for </v>
<v Speaker 3>Parkinson's disease.</v>

1741
01:26:44.220 --> 01:26:49.220
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the responsibility that </v>

1742
01:26:49.220 --> 01:26:51.161
<v Speaker 3>journalists have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's more responsibility than I think </v>

1743
01:26:51.161 --> 01:26:51.161
<v Speaker 3>they'd like to have often.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's the truth.</v>

1744
01:26:51.161 --> 01:26:52.310
<v Speaker 3>You make a joke about Ibogaine.</v>

1745
01:26:52.490 --> 01:26:54.440
<v Speaker 3>Next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's in schedule one.</v>

1746
01:26:54.810 --> 01:26:59.810
<v Speaker 3>Maybe he made the joke afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if he didn't have to wonder because </v>

1747
01:26:59.810 --> 01:27:03.221
<v Speaker 3>that was one of the first major mentions</v>
<v Speaker 3>of Ibogaine in the popular press and the</v>

1748
01:27:03.591 --> 01:27:04.700
<v Speaker 3>same is true of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1749
01:27:04.701 --> 01:27:09.701
<v Speaker 3>there was a rolling stone scare article </v>
<v Speaker 3>that came out a while ago and it same </v>

1750
01:27:09.701 --> 01:27:11.060
<v Speaker 3>deal with this drug to ct seven and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>do a whole story,</v>

1751
01:27:11.061 --> 01:27:11.930
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this teenager,</v>

1752
01:27:11.931 --> 01:27:16.931
<v Speaker 3>he took too much and this to ct seven,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can kill you with just a little pile </v>

1753
01:27:16.931 --> 01:27:18.500
<v Speaker 3>of powder or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1754
01:27:18.910 --> 01:27:23.910
<v Speaker 3>and then the drug is made schedule one </v>
<v Speaker 3>shogun worked on psychedelics.</v>

1755
01:27:24.410 --> 01:27:29.410
<v Speaker 3>Alexander Shogun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>great medicinal chemist who spent his </v>

1756
01:27:29.410 --> 01:27:32.231
<v Speaker 3>entire life studying psychedelics </v>
<v Speaker 3>considered this one of the sixth </v>

1757
01:27:32.231 --> 01:27:35.350
<v Speaker 3>greatest creations of his entire career </v>
<v Speaker 3>squashed by a single stupid story in </v>

1758
01:27:35.350 --> 01:27:37.490
<v Speaker 3>rolling stone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how easily it happens.</v>

1759
01:27:37.790 --> 01:27:38.580
<v Speaker 3>That was the story.</v>

1760
01:27:38.580 --> 01:27:39.350
<v Speaker 3>Stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1761
01:27:39.351 --> 01:27:40.940
<v Speaker 3>did it have any basis?</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

1762
01:27:42.410 --> 01:27:47.410
<v Speaker 3>an editor at rolling stone told me that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there were factual errors in it and </v>

1763
01:27:47.410 --> 01:27:48.230
<v Speaker 3>there's something weird about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yes,</v>

1764
01:27:48.231 --> 01:27:51.800
<v Speaker 3>people did die because yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people die from using drugs occasionally</v>

1765
01:27:51.801 --> 01:27:56.801
<v Speaker 3>to deny that would be to lie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't mean that they don't </v>

1766
01:27:56.801 --> 01:27:59.300
<v Speaker 3>have therapeutic activity and it doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>mean that they should be illegal.</v>

1767
01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:02.630
<v Speaker 3>One of the ones that disturbs me the </v>
<v Speaker 3>most is fentanyl.</v>

1768
01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:05.510
<v Speaker 3>Fentanyl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just.</v>

1769
01:28:05.830 --> 01:28:08.990
<v Speaker 3>I don't even understand why anybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>would want to make that.</v>

1770
01:28:09.050 --> 01:28:12.650
<v Speaker 3>It seems to me that we have no one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>opiates as it is.</v>

1771
01:28:12.710 --> 01:28:15.650
<v Speaker 3>Why make one that's a thousand times </v>
<v Speaker 3>stronger than heroin?</v>

1772
01:28:15.740 --> 01:28:17.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've known for fentanyl chemists,</v>

1773
01:28:17.841 --> 01:28:20.450
<v Speaker 3>including the one that introduced </v>
<v Speaker 3>fentanyl to the United States initially.</v>

1774
01:28:20.451 --> 01:28:22.850
<v Speaker 3>He died recently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did he die from it?</v>

1775
01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:26.330
<v Speaker 3>No one died of old age.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's killed so many people.</v>

1776
01:28:26.380 --> 01:28:27.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tom Petty.</v>

1777
01:28:27.650 --> 01:28:29.450
<v Speaker 3>David Bowie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bowie one.</v>

1778
01:28:30.250 --> 01:28:32.510
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Prince.</v>

1779
01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:34.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm mean.</v>

1780
01:28:34.490 --> 01:28:38.390
<v Speaker 3>There's quite a few great people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we've lost to this stuff.</v>

1781
01:28:38.450 --> 01:28:39.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really.</v>

1782
01:28:39.860 --> 01:28:42.020
<v Speaker 3>It's unfortunate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but again,</v>

1783
01:28:42.170 --> 01:28:47.170
<v Speaker 3>fentanyl is not the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem is people taking it and the </v>

1784
01:28:47.301 --> 01:28:52.301
<v Speaker 3>problem is lack of access to safer </v>
<v Speaker 3>opioids and lack of education </v>

1785
01:28:52.301 --> 01:28:54.590
<v Speaker 3>surrounding fentanyl because it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>even really have desirable properties.</v>

1786
01:28:54.591 --> 01:28:56.270
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one thing that people always talk about,</v>

1787
01:28:56.271 --> 01:29:01.271
<v Speaker 3>the potency offense and on one thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they don't often talk about is the </v>

1788
01:29:01.271 --> 01:29:01.271
<v Speaker 3>duration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very,</v>

1789
01:29:01.271 --> 01:29:05.040
<v Speaker 3>very short duration opioid which </v>
<v Speaker 3>necessitates compulsive,</v>

1790
01:29:05.090 --> 01:29:06.210
<v Speaker 3>constant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>re dosing.</v>

1791
01:29:06.211 --> 01:29:11.211
<v Speaker 3>If you're addicted to fentanyl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless you're doing a transdermal patch </v>

1792
01:29:11.211 --> 01:29:14.391
<v Speaker 3>or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you typically can't make it through a </v>

1793
01:29:14.391 --> 01:29:15.300
<v Speaker 3>single night without having to reduce </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the duration is so short.</v>

1794
01:29:15.330 --> 01:29:20.330
<v Speaker 3>That's why it's always done in these </v>
<v Speaker 3>prolonged release formulations like a </v>

1795
01:29:20.330 --> 01:29:22.950
<v Speaker 3>lollipop that you suck or a patch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but anyway,</v>

1796
01:29:22.951 --> 01:29:23.130
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>

1797
01:29:23.130 --> 01:29:23.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>

1798
01:29:23.441 --> 01:29:27.030
<v Speaker 3>It's not a drug that's well suited to </v>
<v Speaker 3>street use.</v>

1799
01:29:27.031 --> 01:29:30.300
<v Speaker 3>It's to the therapeutic index is too </v>
<v Speaker 3>narrow.</v>

1800
01:29:30.570 --> 01:29:35.570
<v Speaker 3>It's duration is too short.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has a medical purpose that it works </v>

1801
01:29:35.570 --> 01:29:39.501
<v Speaker 3>very well for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It shouldn't be used as a heroine </v>

1802
01:29:39.501 --> 01:29:43.041
<v Speaker 3>replacement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the economic reality is that you </v>

1803
01:29:43.041 --> 01:29:43.610
<v Speaker 3>have to make heroin from opium,</v>
<v Speaker 3>opium,</v>

1804
01:29:43.611 --> 01:29:46.110
<v Speaker 3>s that come from a place where poppies </v>
<v Speaker 3>are grown.</v>

1805
01:29:46.290 --> 01:29:51.290
<v Speaker 3>That's a whole process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas fentanyl can be made by one guy </v>

1806
01:29:51.290 --> 01:29:55.610
<v Speaker 3>somewhere and the profit margin on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fentanyl is so much greater that there's</v>

1807
01:29:55.770 --> 01:29:58.410
<v Speaker 3>an enormous economic incentive and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>first chemist,</v>

1808
01:29:58.560 --> 01:30:01.320
<v Speaker 3>this guy that was sort of a friend of </v>
<v Speaker 3>mine that died to do it,</v>

1809
01:30:01.770 --> 01:30:06.770
<v Speaker 3>considered it a good thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the complexity that you have to </v>

1810
01:30:06.770 --> 01:30:08.850
<v Speaker 3>recognize it so easy to say that all of </v>
<v Speaker 3>these people are so bad,</v>

1811
01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:12.510
<v Speaker 3>but often you don't know what's going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>happen until it happens.</v>

1812
01:30:12.600 --> 01:30:17.600
<v Speaker 3>His idea was that one of the major </v>
<v Speaker 3>burdens of being addicted to heroin is </v>

1813
01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:20.160
<v Speaker 3>that you can't afford it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really expensive,</v>

1814
01:30:20.250 --> 01:30:23.640
<v Speaker 3>so by substituting this relatively </v>
<v Speaker 3>inexpensive material,</v>

1815
01:30:23.880 --> 01:30:28.880
<v Speaker 3>the price of heroin would go down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This financial burden associated with </v>

1816
01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:31.170
<v Speaker 3>opioid addiction would be reduced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would actually improve the quality of</v>

1817
01:30:31.171 --> 01:30:34.230
<v Speaker 3>life of the users,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it could even be a more pure,</v>

1818
01:30:34.231 --> 01:30:37.110
<v Speaker 3>potentially safer material.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you look at certain literature,</v>

1819
01:30:37.170 --> 01:30:42.170
<v Speaker 3>of course that's not what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and many people died and he went to </v>

1820
01:30:42.170 --> 01:30:42.750
<v Speaker 3>prison as a result of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did it really?</v>

1821
01:30:42.751 --> 01:30:44.730
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why don't he go to prison for it?</v>

1822
01:30:45.210 --> 01:30:47.640
<v Speaker 3>Because people died and it was traced </v>
<v Speaker 3>back to him.</v>

1823
01:30:48.390 --> 01:30:49.380
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1824
01:30:50.430 --> 01:30:52.890
<v Speaker 3>so he wasn't doing this in any </v>
<v Speaker 3>sanctioned?</v>

1825
01:30:53.490 --> 01:30:54.900
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a clandestine chemist.</v>

1826
01:30:54.901 --> 01:30:59.160
<v Speaker 3>His name was George Marquardt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Weird guy.</v>

1827
01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:00.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1828
01:31:00.720 --> 01:31:02.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>

1829
01:31:02.340 --> 01:31:03.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just don't know.</v>

1830
01:31:03.690 --> 01:31:06.300
<v Speaker 3>You don't know what's going to happen </v>
<v Speaker 3>until it happens.</v>

1831
01:31:06.390 --> 01:31:07.020
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>

1832
01:31:07.050 --> 01:31:12.050
<v Speaker 3>the legendary story that heroin was </v>
<v Speaker 3>introduced by Bayer as a nonaddictive </v>

1833
01:31:12.050 --> 01:31:16.041
<v Speaker 3>alternative to morphine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They probably did think that was the </v>

1834
01:31:16.041 --> 01:31:19.881
<v Speaker 3>case at the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but history has shown that that is not </v>

1835
01:31:19.881 --> 01:31:23.691
<v Speaker 3>the case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the problems with </v>

1836
01:31:23.691 --> 01:31:23.691
<v Speaker 3>introducing any drug to a large </v>
<v Speaker 3>population.</v>

1837
01:31:23.691 --> 01:31:28.101
<v Speaker 3>You simply don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's and it's also one of the things </v>

1838
01:31:28.101 --> 01:31:30.680
<v Speaker 3>that I find most interesting in and </v>
<v Speaker 3>perhaps a silver lining in this whole </v>

1839
01:31:30.680 --> 01:31:34.680
<v Speaker 3>synthetic cannabinoid narrative that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>been playing out over the last decade is</v>

1840
01:31:34.681 --> 01:31:35.160
<v Speaker 3>you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1841
01:31:35.161 --> 01:31:36.990
<v Speaker 3>it's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People should just smoke cannabis,</v>

1842
01:31:37.050 --> 01:31:42.050
<v Speaker 3>but we're learning so much about what </v>
<v Speaker 3>cannabinoid receptor agonists can do </v>

1843
01:31:42.300 --> 01:31:47.300
<v Speaker 3>that we would have never learned if it </v>
<v Speaker 3>weren't for the widespread use of </v>

1844
01:31:47.300 --> 01:31:47.300
<v Speaker 3>synthetic cannabinoids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1845
01:31:47.300 --> 01:31:50.370
<v Speaker 3>just for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it is possible for high potency,</v>

1846
01:31:50.371 --> 01:31:52.560
<v Speaker 3>so cannabinoid receptor agonist to kill </v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1847
01:31:52.770 --> 01:31:53.400
<v Speaker 3>that's a big one.</v>

1848
01:31:53.400 --> 01:31:57.120
<v Speaker 3>We didn't know that until recently that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they can be addictive.</v>

1849
01:31:57.240 --> 01:31:58.770
<v Speaker 3>We didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are they using,</v>

1850
01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:01.450
<v Speaker 3>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so.</v>

1851
01:32:01.451 --> 01:32:04.780
<v Speaker 3>It's an impressively diverse array of </v>
<v Speaker 3>chemicals.</v>

1852
01:32:04.820 --> 01:32:07.540
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it started out with a drug called CP 55,</v>

1853
01:32:07.550 --> 01:32:10.970
<v Speaker 3>9:40,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it was cp a,</v>

1854
01:32:11.900 --> 01:32:16.900
<v Speaker 3>what they call it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cannibis cycle of hex and all now and </v>

1855
01:32:16.900 --> 01:32:19.600
<v Speaker 3>then Jwh jwh 73,</v>
<v Speaker 3>jwh 2:10</v>

1856
01:32:19.601 --> 01:32:24.601
<v Speaker 3>on and on and on and on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then it just branched like a giant </v>

1857
01:32:24.601 --> 01:32:26.530
<v Speaker 3>cannabinoid fractal in every imaginable </v>
<v Speaker 3>imaginable direction.</v>

1858
01:32:26.770 --> 01:32:28.690
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of these compounds,</v>

1859
01:32:28.760 --> 01:32:29.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1860
01:32:29.160 --> 01:32:32.350
<v Speaker 3>they were patented by various </v>
<v Speaker 3>pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer for</v>

1861
01:32:32.351 --> 01:32:33.670
<v Speaker 3>therapeutic purposes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

1862
01:32:33.671 --> 01:32:36.040
<v Speaker 3>this wasn't some level and chemist who's</v>
<v Speaker 3>cackling and saying,</v>

1863
01:32:36.140 --> 01:32:41.140
<v Speaker 3>ha ha ha.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I figured out the most addictive thing </v>

1864
01:32:41.140 --> 01:32:43.201
<v Speaker 3>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were just looking to see what's </v>

1865
01:32:43.201 --> 01:32:45.151
<v Speaker 3>legal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what looks pretty potent and reasonably </v>

1866
01:32:45.151 --> 01:32:45.151
<v Speaker 3>safe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1867
01:32:45.151 --> 01:32:45.310
<v Speaker 3>we'll make that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll sell it.</v>

1868
01:32:45.610 --> 01:32:50.610
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I've spoken with the chemists that </v>

1869
01:32:50.610 --> 01:32:50.610
<v Speaker 3>actually were behind a lot of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>operations.</v>

1870
01:32:50.610 --> 01:32:52.780
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not bad guys necessarily,</v>

1871
01:32:53.350 --> 01:32:54.160
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1872
01:32:54.190 --> 01:32:59.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>typically people don't want to hurt </v>

1873
01:32:59.190 --> 01:32:59.190
<v Speaker 3>other people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1874
01:32:59.190 --> 01:33:03.120
<v Speaker 3>genuine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>villainous people are pretty rare in my </v>

1875
01:33:03.120 --> 01:33:06.601
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most people believe that what they're </v>

1876
01:33:06.601 --> 01:33:06.970
<v Speaker 3>doing has a justification that is good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>

1877
01:33:06.971 --> 01:33:11.440
<v Speaker 3>with the synthetic cannabinoid ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one is that although you won't hear this</v>

1878
01:33:11.441 --> 01:33:16.441
<v Speaker 3>in the popular press and it's rarely </v>
<v Speaker 3>said they can be very enjoyable and it </v>

1879
01:33:16.601 --> 01:33:21.601
<v Speaker 3>would be dishonest to say otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of them are very euphoric and </v>

1880
01:33:21.601 --> 01:33:23.770
<v Speaker 3>compare favorably to cannabis and in </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain measures might even be superior.</v>

1881
01:33:23.800 --> 01:33:28.800
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't mean they're safer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just means that there's something </v>

1882
01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:29.500
<v Speaker 3>very desirable but them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you deny that,</v>

1883
01:33:29.560 --> 01:33:33.340
<v Speaker 3>then you neglect to understand why </v>
<v Speaker 3>people use them in the first place,</v>

1884
01:33:33.341 --> 01:33:34.570
<v Speaker 3>which is that they make you feel good.</v>

1885
01:33:35.470 --> 01:33:40.470
<v Speaker 3>So that's part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then the other thing is the urine </v>

1886
01:33:40.470 --> 01:33:44.011
<v Speaker 3>testing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people wanting to be able to get high </v>

1887
01:33:44.011 --> 01:33:44.011
<v Speaker 3>without breaking the law,</v>
<v Speaker 3>low cost.</v>

1888
01:33:44.011 --> 01:33:48.160
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's a lot of motivations for </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing this and as it played out,</v>

1889
01:33:48.161 --> 01:33:51.580
<v Speaker 3>people died.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People became addicted and random things</v>

1890
01:33:51.581 --> 01:33:53.320
<v Speaker 3>that no one would have ever expected </v>
<v Speaker 3>occurred.</v>

1891
01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:55.840
<v Speaker 3>We learned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's another silver lining.</v>

1892
01:33:55.960 --> 01:33:59.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you're familiar with cannabis </v>
<v Speaker 3>hyperemesis syndrome.</v>

1893
01:33:59.490 --> 01:34:00.090
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>

1894
01:34:00.260 --> 01:34:00.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1895
01:34:00.890 --> 01:34:05.890
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is our pattern that certain people </v>

1896
01:34:05.890 --> 01:34:06.330
<v Speaker 3>that smoke all day every day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1897
01:34:06.940 --> 01:34:09.460
<v Speaker 3>it started showing up in the medical </v>
<v Speaker 3>literature about a decade ago.</v>

1898
01:34:09.461 --> 01:34:11.860
<v Speaker 3>People smoke all day every day and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>start getting very,</v>

1899
01:34:11.861 --> 01:34:16.861
<v Speaker 3>very nauseous and vomiting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the only thing that can relieve the </v>

1900
01:34:16.861 --> 01:34:17.100
<v Speaker 3>vomiting is a hot shower.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

1901
01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:22.120
<v Speaker 3>So really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So all these people are showing up in </v>

1902
01:34:22.120 --> 01:34:22.420
<v Speaker 3>emergency rooms when they run out of hot</v>
<v Speaker 3>water.</v>

1903
01:34:22.690 --> 01:34:25.360
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need some kind of a,</v>

1904
01:34:25.690 --> 01:34:28.330
<v Speaker 3>I need some help or something like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what's going on.</v>

1905
01:34:28.600 --> 01:34:33.600
<v Speaker 3>The condition resolves itself very </v>
<v Speaker 3>rapidly as soon as you stopped smoking </v>

1906
01:34:33.600 --> 01:34:35.560
<v Speaker 3>cannabis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's not hard to treat.</v>

1907
01:34:35.590 --> 01:34:40.590
<v Speaker 3>You can't smoke weed anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no one knew what caused it and why </v>

1908
01:34:40.590 --> 01:34:43.750
<v Speaker 3>it was happening now after thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 3>years of human cannabis interaction.</v>

1909
01:34:43.751 --> 01:34:48.751
<v Speaker 3>Why now for the first time in history?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the answer is that people are </v>

1910
01:34:48.751 --> 01:34:51.750
<v Speaker 3>smoking more weed now than ever before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1911
01:34:51.760 --> 01:34:55.960
<v Speaker 3>the levels of thc ingestion with dabbing</v>
<v Speaker 3>and high potency strains are just higher</v>

1912
01:34:56.110 --> 01:35:01.110
<v Speaker 3>for some people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's much higher than it's ever been in </v>

1913
01:35:01.110 --> 01:35:01.110
<v Speaker 3>the past.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

1914
01:35:01.110 --> 01:35:02.140
<v Speaker 3>but then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is causing it?</v>

1915
01:35:02.200 --> 01:35:04.450
<v Speaker 3>Is it the cannabis itself is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fertilizer,</v>

1916
01:35:04.451 --> 01:35:07.330
<v Speaker 3>is it a pesticide?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is responsible for this?</v>

1917
01:35:07.570 --> 01:35:12.570
<v Speaker 3>And it wasn't until people were using </v>
<v Speaker 3>synthetic cannabinoids began to </v>

1918
01:35:12.570 --> 01:35:14.020
<v Speaker 3>experience the same constellation of </v>
<v Speaker 3>symptoms that they realized that this is</v>

1919
01:35:14.021 --> 01:35:17.650
<v Speaker 3>an intrinsic property of certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>cannabinoid receptor agonists.</v>

1920
01:35:17.920 --> 01:35:19.840
<v Speaker 3>So that's something that you can learn </v>
<v Speaker 3>from all of this,</v>

1921
01:35:19.930 --> 01:35:24.930
<v Speaker 3>that it wasn't pesticides and it wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>some kind of a fungus or something like </v>

1922
01:35:24.930 --> 01:35:29.281
<v Speaker 3>that girl on the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is something that happens from </v>

1923
01:35:29.281 --> 01:35:31.351
<v Speaker 3>prolonged high dose use of cannabinoids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's all sorts of other lessons </v>

1924
01:35:31.351 --> 01:35:31.351
<v Speaker 3>that can be learned.</v>

1925
01:35:31.351 --> 01:35:33.870
<v Speaker 4>Is that an issue with cannabis use?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pesticides?</v>

1926
01:35:34.170 --> 01:35:37.500
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever heard of people having </v>
<v Speaker 4>real problem with this?</v>

1927
01:35:38.060 --> 01:35:39.230
<v Speaker 3>It was certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1928
01:35:39.231 --> 01:35:41.710
<v Speaker 3>paraquat pot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you ever hear what's that?</v>

1929
01:35:41.810 --> 01:35:43.240
<v Speaker 3>Paraquat was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1930
01:35:43.770 --> 01:35:48.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in one of many misguided attempts to </v>

1931
01:35:48.770 --> 01:35:51.621
<v Speaker 3>prevent people from using drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they started spraying all of the </v>

1932
01:35:51.621 --> 01:35:54.650
<v Speaker 3>cannabis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was grown in Mexico with this ultra </v>

1933
01:35:54.650 --> 01:35:57.351
<v Speaker 3>toxic herbicide called paraquat and this</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a drug that induces Parkinson's </v>

1934
01:35:59.561 --> 01:36:03.370
<v Speaker 3>disease when you're exposed to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like really seriously nasty stuff.</v>

1935
01:36:03.460 --> 01:36:08.020
<v Speaker 3>No joke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the idea was if we poison all the</v>

1936
01:36:08.021 --> 01:36:13.021
<v Speaker 3>cannabis and create this widespread fear</v>
<v Speaker 3>that whatever you're smoking might </v>

1937
01:36:13.021 --> 01:36:15.040
<v Speaker 3>contain paraquat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe people will use it less.</v>

1938
01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:20.520
<v Speaker 3>And Luckily paraquat is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't have a lot of thermo stability.</v>

1939
01:36:21.101 --> 01:36:23.110
<v Speaker 3>It's sort of denatured by the heat of </v>
<v Speaker 3>smoking.</v>

1940
01:36:23.111 --> 01:36:25.990
<v Speaker 3>So it's argued that people were not </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually exposed to it,</v>

1941
01:36:25.991 --> 01:36:29.140
<v Speaker 3>who smoked it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but still this is a horrendous thing for</v>

1942
01:36:29.141 --> 01:36:34.141
<v Speaker 3>the government to have done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They did the same thing during alcohol </v>

1943
01:36:34.141 --> 01:36:34.141
<v Speaker 3>prohibition by the way they would poison</v>
<v Speaker 3>alcohol.</v>

1944
01:36:34.141 --> 01:36:38.311
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's the extent they'll poison </v>
<v Speaker 3>people to prevent them from getting </v>

1945
01:36:38.311 --> 01:36:39.140
<v Speaker 3>high.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

1946
01:36:39.700 --> 01:36:41.170
<v Speaker 3>that's a reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1947
01:36:43.630 --> 01:36:45.700
<v Speaker 3>but now in turn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1948
01:36:45.740 --> 01:36:48.830
<v Speaker 3>there's obviously a move toward organic </v>
<v Speaker 3>gardening people using,</v>

1949
01:36:48.890 --> 01:36:52.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>neem oil and things like that.</v>

1950
01:36:52.241 --> 01:36:53.940
<v Speaker 3>So I wouldn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll go in.</v>

1951
01:36:53.980 --> 01:36:54.610
<v Speaker 3>There was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1952
01:36:54.611 --> 01:36:59.611
<v Speaker 3>there was actually a big controversy in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Colorado with a pesticide called Mike </v>

1953
01:36:59.611 --> 01:37:01.270
<v Speaker 3>Club.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You tennille I believe that was used.</v>

1954
01:37:01.330 --> 01:37:03.670
<v Speaker 3>And potentially could release cyanide </v>
<v Speaker 3>when smoked.</v>

1955
01:37:04.090 --> 01:37:04.450
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1956
01:37:05.020 --> 01:37:06.030
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1957
01:37:06.330 --> 01:37:11.330
<v Speaker 4>Why would worry about that with large </v>
<v Speaker 4>scale production things become </v>

1958
01:37:11.330 --> 01:37:14.310
<v Speaker 4>commercially viable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The point where someone like rj reynolds</v>

1959
01:37:14.311 --> 01:37:19.311
<v Speaker 4>gets into the mix and starts growing </v>
<v Speaker 4>enormous marijuana plantations.</v>

1960
01:37:21.300 --> 01:37:26.300
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's a concern with all the food </v>

1961
01:37:26.300 --> 01:37:26.300
<v Speaker 3>that we eat as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>

1962
01:37:26.300 --> 01:37:26.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1963
01:37:26.460 --> 01:37:31.460
<v Speaker 4>What is interesting to you now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like is there anything that's coming up </v>

1964
01:37:31.460 --> 01:37:35.571
<v Speaker 4>or some new thing that people aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>might not be aware of that might be </v>

1965
01:37:35.571 --> 01:37:35.571
<v Speaker 4>fascinating to you?</v>

1966
01:37:35.790 --> 01:37:36.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1967
01:37:36.601 --> 01:37:37.560
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1968
01:37:38.230 --> 01:37:39.820
<v Speaker 3>I'm interested in everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1969
01:37:39.821 --> 01:37:41.260
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love the history.</v>

1970
01:37:41.261 --> 01:37:42.530
<v Speaker 3>I love,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1971
01:37:42.550 --> 01:37:47.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did a piece in this last season of my </v>

1972
01:37:47.550 --> 01:37:49.320
<v Speaker 3>tv show or I traced the history of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Psychedelic toad venom of five Meo dmt </v>

1973
01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:54.360
<v Speaker 3>containing toad venom because people </v>
<v Speaker 3>have this idea that all psychedelics </v>

1974
01:37:54.360 --> 01:37:57.571
<v Speaker 3>have been used for thousands of years </v>
<v Speaker 3>that every psychedelic an ancient </v>

1975
01:37:57.571 --> 01:37:58.560
<v Speaker 3>history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when you look at the history of five</v>

1976
01:37:58.561 --> 01:38:01.320
<v Speaker 3>Meo DMT,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is no evidence.</v>

1977
01:38:01.321 --> 01:38:03.510
<v Speaker 3>Really no convincing evidence that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>aware of.</v>

1978
01:38:03.511 --> 01:38:08.511
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you can point to a ceramic toad is</v>
<v Speaker 3>that evidence that people smoke toad </v>

1979
01:38:08.511 --> 01:38:08.511
<v Speaker 3>venom?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not In my opinion,</v>

1980
01:38:08.511 --> 01:38:11.130
<v Speaker 3>it might be some indication that maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>they did,</v>

1981
01:38:11.131 --> 01:38:16.131
<v Speaker 3>but it's certainly not hard evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even if there were a guy sitting on his </v>

1982
01:38:16.131 --> 01:38:17.700
<v Speaker 3>back smoking a pipe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wouldn't be hard evidence.</v>

1983
01:38:18.150 --> 01:38:23.150
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there isn't convincing evidence as </v>

1984
01:38:23.150 --> 01:38:23.160
<v Speaker 3>far as I'm concerned of ancient toad I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>used.</v>

1985
01:38:23.160 --> 01:38:24.840
<v Speaker 3>So then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when did it start?</v>

1986
01:38:24.841 --> 01:38:27.540
<v Speaker 3>Who was the first person to do this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

1987
01:38:27.750 --> 01:38:31.890
<v Speaker 3>I love these little historical </v>
<v Speaker 3>investigations to get to the bottom.</v>

1988
01:38:31.891 --> 01:38:34.230
<v Speaker 3>Who is the first person to synthesize </v>
<v Speaker 3>this drug?</v>

1989
01:38:34.260 --> 01:38:36.480
<v Speaker 3>What were their intentions?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who's the first person to smoke?</v>

1990
01:38:36.481 --> 01:38:39.210
<v Speaker 3>Toad venom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the total volume is a weird one too,</v>

1991
01:38:39.211 --> 01:38:43.230
<v Speaker 3>because there's this bizarre </v>
<v Speaker 3>misconception that you lick the toads.</v>

1992
01:38:43.500 --> 01:38:44.670
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which again,</v>

1993
01:38:44.671 --> 01:38:49.671
<v Speaker 3>journalistically produced,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe it was inspired by cartoons as </v>

1994
01:38:49.671 --> 01:38:49.950
<v Speaker 3>well to some extent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I.</v>

1995
01:38:49.951 --> 01:38:54.951
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the way you do it is you have to get </v>

1996
01:38:54.951 --> 01:38:58.041
<v Speaker 3>the tow to excrete whatever this is and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you put it on glass and then you dry it </v>

1997
01:38:58.041 --> 01:38:58.770
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that the idea?</v>

1998
01:38:58.800 --> 01:38:59.880
<v Speaker 3>That's the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1999
01:38:59.940 --> 01:39:02.760
<v Speaker 3>And then you scrape it off with a razor </v>
<v Speaker 3>blade and then smoke it.</v>

2000
01:39:02.790 --> 01:39:04.620
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And does it come,</v>

2001
01:39:04.621 --> 01:39:07.440
<v Speaker 3>is it a pure form of five Meo DMT?</v>

2002
01:39:07.470 --> 01:39:12.470
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's actually very little </v>

2003
01:39:12.470 --> 01:39:12.470
<v Speaker 3>chemical analysis that's been done in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the 21st century.</v>

2004
01:39:12.470 --> 01:39:16.770
<v Speaker 3>I analyzed a sample that I collected </v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was in Sonora and it contained in</v>

2005
01:39:16.771 --> 01:39:21.771
<v Speaker 3>addition to five Meo dmt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It contained some interesting serotonin </v>

2006
01:39:21.771 --> 01:39:26.360
<v Speaker 3>derivatives including serotonin sulfate </v>
<v Speaker 3>and nobody knows how these different </v>

2007
01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:31.640
<v Speaker 3>tryptamine components as well as these </v>
<v Speaker 3>steroidal lactones that are sometimes </v>

2008
01:39:31.640 --> 01:39:32.910
<v Speaker 3>called bufo talks and contribute to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>

2009
01:39:33.960 --> 01:39:35.790
<v Speaker 3>If I had to guess,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably not that much,</v>

2010
01:39:35.791 --> 01:39:40.791
<v Speaker 3>but maybe there's a little bit of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of entourage effect that you get </v>

2011
01:39:40.791 --> 01:39:43.941
<v Speaker 3>with almost any plant that has a variety</v>
<v Speaker 3>of different alkaloids that might </v>

2012
01:39:43.941 --> 01:39:44.970
<v Speaker 3>inhibit certain enzymes or do this or </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2013
01:39:45.380 --> 01:39:50.380
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's about 15 percent according to </v>

2014
01:39:50.380 --> 01:39:53.631
<v Speaker 3>the older literature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The analysis that I did wasn't </v>

2015
01:39:53.631 --> 01:39:56.121
<v Speaker 3>quantitative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I don't know exactly what the </v>

2016
01:39:56.121 --> 01:39:56.121
<v Speaker 3>concentration was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's somewhere in that region.</v>

2017
01:39:56.121 --> 01:40:00.591
<v Speaker 3>And I'm sure it depends on whether the </v>
<v Speaker 3>toad has been milked previously and all </v>

2018
01:40:00.591 --> 01:40:00.591
<v Speaker 3>these other variables.</v>

2019
01:40:00.591 --> 01:40:04.260
<v Speaker 3>Does the experience mirror taking </v>
<v Speaker 3>synthetic five meo dmt?</v>

2020
01:40:04.530 --> 01:40:09.530
<v Speaker 3>I haven't tried.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've tried synthetic five mud empty a </v>

2021
01:40:09.530 --> 01:40:10.020
<v Speaker 3>couple times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've tried boof,</v>

2022
01:40:10.130 --> 01:40:13.230
<v Speaker 3>all various venom wanted a low dose once</v>
<v Speaker 3>at a high dose.</v>

2023
01:40:13.430 --> 01:40:15.870
<v Speaker 3>There were all different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then everything is different.</v>

2024
01:40:15.871 --> 01:40:17.790
<v Speaker 3>Mushrooms are different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every time I take them,</v>

2025
01:40:18.090 --> 01:40:18.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2026
01:40:18.541 --> 01:40:23.541
<v Speaker 3>it's really hard once you start </v>
<v Speaker 3>explaining a different experience based </v>

2027
01:40:23.641 --> 01:40:28.641
<v Speaker 3>on the composition of the material </v>
<v Speaker 3>because how do you assign it to the dose</v>

2028
01:40:28.831 --> 01:40:33.720
<v Speaker 3>or the minute number of different </v>
<v Speaker 3>tryptamines that are also present.</v>

2029
01:40:33.721 --> 01:40:36.060
<v Speaker 3>It's really hard to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

2030
01:40:36.061 --> 01:40:41.061
<v Speaker 3>I think that there is a strong argument </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be made for using the synthetic as </v>

2031
01:40:41.061 --> 01:40:43.350
<v Speaker 3>opposed to the pto drive materials </v>
<v Speaker 3>simply because you don't have to harm or</v>

2032
01:40:43.351 --> 01:40:45.480
<v Speaker 3>hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not that it necessarily does harm toads,</v>

2033
01:40:45.660 --> 01:40:49.740
<v Speaker 3>but you don't even have to risk it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's easy to synthesize.</v>

2034
01:40:50.420 --> 01:40:51.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure it.</v>

2035
01:40:51.461 --> 01:40:53.530
<v Speaker 3>Toads aren't into getting rubbed on </v>
<v Speaker 3>windshields.</v>

2036
01:40:53.910 --> 01:40:57.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Similar to annoying day for a toad.</v>

2037
01:40:57.070 --> 01:40:57.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2038
01:40:57.780 --> 01:40:59.690
<v Speaker 3>They want to eat insects.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2039
01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:01.650
<v Speaker 3>Whatever the fuck they do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2040
01:41:02.140 --> 01:41:05.770
<v Speaker 2>one of the more interesting stories out </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the last decade or so was,</v>

2041
01:41:05.771 --> 01:41:06.310
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2042
01:41:06.800 --> 01:41:07.340
<v Speaker 3>this</v>

2043
01:41:07.730 --> 01:41:11.150
<v Speaker 2>story that I read about these scholars </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Jerusalem,</v>

2044
01:41:11.660 --> 01:41:16.660
<v Speaker 2>that we're connecting the story of Moses</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the burning Bush to the Acacia Bush </v>

2045
01:41:18.680 --> 01:41:23.210
<v Speaker 2>and the case should tree which is rich </v>
<v Speaker 2>and dmt and they believe that,</v>

2046
01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:28.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're talking about a story that </v>

2047
01:41:28.600 --> 01:41:30.701
<v Speaker 2>was told through oral traditions for who</v>
<v Speaker 2>knows how many years and then written </v>

2048
01:41:31.341 --> 01:41:36.341
<v Speaker 2>down in ancient Hebrew and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>transcribed and you know,</v>

2049
01:41:39.390 --> 01:41:43.860
<v Speaker 2>and translated to Greek and Latin and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all these days there's a lot lost in the</v>

2050
01:41:43.861 --> 01:41:46.320
<v Speaker 2>mix.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they believed that,</v>

2051
01:41:46.410 --> 01:41:51.410
<v Speaker 2>what that story might have been about of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Moses coming down from Mount Sinai with </v>

2052
01:41:53.281 --> 01:41:57.370
<v Speaker 2>the tablets and having the experience </v>
<v Speaker 2>with meeting God in a burning Bush.</v>

2053
01:41:57.570 --> 01:42:00.780
<v Speaker 2>This is in fact was a dimethyltryptamine</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>

2054
01:42:01.490 --> 01:42:03.190
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2055
01:42:03.900 --> 01:42:05.010
<v Speaker 3>A,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a big.</v>

2056
01:42:05.011 --> 01:42:08.720
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's a big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I can say that.</v>

2057
01:42:08.721 --> 01:42:13.721
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you go to the south of Mexico in </v>

2058
01:42:13.721 --> 01:42:13.770
<v Speaker 3>Chiapas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a tree that grows.</v>

2059
01:42:13.771 --> 01:42:17.100
<v Speaker 3>There is a weed called Mimosa hostility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you're familiar with it.</v>

2060
01:42:17.340 --> 01:42:20.850
<v Speaker 3>And this is so abundant that it's used </v>
<v Speaker 3>to make fence posts.</v>

2061
01:42:20.851 --> 01:42:23.490
<v Speaker 3>All the fences on the side of the road </v>
<v Speaker 3>are made of most of hostility.</v>

2062
01:42:23.500 --> 01:42:28.500
<v Speaker 3>It's used as firewood to cook meals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The air smells like dmt because people </v>

2063
01:42:28.761 --> 01:42:33.761
<v Speaker 3>are using it as fuel all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not a single person that I spoke with </v>

2064
01:42:34.330 --> 01:42:37.910
<v Speaker 3>was aware that it with psychoactive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And these are people that are burning it</v>

2065
01:42:38.370 --> 01:42:39.480
<v Speaker 3>all the time.</v>

2066
01:42:39.600 --> 01:42:44.600
<v Speaker 2>Do they get high from it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there like if you were in a tent or </v>

2067
01:42:44.600 --> 01:42:48.261
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were doing a hot box sort of </v>

2068
01:42:48.261 --> 01:42:48.261
<v Speaker 2>scenario,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you get high from it?</v>

2069
01:42:48.261 --> 01:42:49.050
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw no.</v>

2070
01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:51.000
<v Speaker 3>Would you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It may be.</v>

2071
01:42:51.880 --> 01:42:56.880
<v Speaker 3>It's about two percent dmt so you'd </v>
<v Speaker 3>probably have to get so sick from </v>

2072
01:42:57.330 --> 01:42:59.290
<v Speaker 3>coughing and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would be a very.</v>

2073
01:42:59.291 --> 01:43:02.210
<v Speaker 3>I mean even just smoking pure crystal </v>
<v Speaker 3>Dmt,</v>

2074
01:43:02.211 --> 01:43:03.880
<v Speaker 3>it can be very difficult for some </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

2075
01:43:03.881 --> 01:43:08.881
<v Speaker 3>So my gas not to be like a wet blanket,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but my guess is not really.</v>

2076
01:43:11.470 --> 01:43:14.370
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's a very strong source.</v>

2077
01:43:14.371 --> 01:43:17.400
<v Speaker 3>As strong as maybe there's some acacia </v>
<v Speaker 3>stronger,</v>

2078
01:43:17.401 --> 01:43:20.190
<v Speaker 3>but that's certainly comparable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's something people are using to</v>

2079
01:43:20.191 --> 01:43:22.160
<v Speaker 3>cook food all the time and they're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>aware that it's like,</v>

2080
01:43:22.380 --> 01:43:27.380
<v Speaker 2>so was there a way or is there a way for</v>
<v Speaker 2>a person living thousands of years ago </v>

2081
01:43:29.820 --> 01:43:33.390
<v Speaker 2>to somehow or another extract dmt from </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like the Acacia Tree?</v>

2082
01:43:34.980 --> 01:43:38.650
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's actually spent some time thinking</v>

2083
01:43:38.651 --> 01:43:40.780
<v Speaker 3>about that a while ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would be,</v>

2084
01:43:42.380 --> 01:43:44.750
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>depends on how you define extraction.</v>

2085
01:43:44.751 --> 01:43:47.210
<v Speaker 3>If it were to in like an Iowasca sends </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a tea,</v>

2086
01:43:47.211 --> 01:43:48.320
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

2087
01:43:48.321 --> 01:43:51.050
<v Speaker 3>But then they would need some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>enzyme inhibitor to create the.</v>

2088
01:43:51.920 --> 01:43:55.970
<v Speaker 3>If it were to create a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an isolated smokable form again,</v>

2089
01:43:55.971 --> 01:44:00.971
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could just do it like an aqueous </v>

2090
01:44:00.971 --> 01:44:00.971
<v Speaker 3>infusion and then try that out and maybe</v>
<v Speaker 3>smoke that.</v>

2091
01:44:00.971 --> 01:44:04.310
<v Speaker 3>But in terms of like a real extraction </v>
<v Speaker 3>that would produce crystals of DMT,</v>

2092
01:44:04.490 --> 01:44:09.490
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the non polar solvent </v>
<v Speaker 3>they would be using to extract a </v>

2093
01:44:09.490 --> 01:44:09.770
<v Speaker 3>freebase.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would it be like butter or something.</v>

2094
01:44:09.771 --> 01:44:11.510
<v Speaker 3>And then how would you get rid of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>butter?</v>

2095
01:44:11.511 --> 01:44:16.511
<v Speaker 3>So what is the process like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to take a tree that's </v>

2096
01:44:16.511 --> 01:44:19.691
<v Speaker 3>rich and DMT and extract dmt from it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you have to use a.</v>

2097
01:44:20.510 --> 01:44:21.650
<v Speaker 3>have you ever done it before?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2098
01:44:21.651 --> 01:44:22.550
<v Speaker 3>I've never done it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2099
01:44:22.551 --> 01:44:23.750
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2100
01:44:24.290 --> 01:44:29.290
<v Speaker 3>it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a very generalizable and simple </v>

2101
01:44:29.290 --> 01:44:30.230
<v Speaker 3>process that applies to almost </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything in chemistry.</v>

2102
01:44:30.231 --> 01:44:30.740
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2103
01:44:30.770 --> 01:44:33.080
<v Speaker 3>sometimes it's called an acid base </v>
<v Speaker 3>extraction.</v>

2104
01:44:33.500 --> 01:44:38.500
<v Speaker 3>Most people that are in the dmt </v>
<v Speaker 3>community go something they call </v>

2105
01:44:38.500 --> 01:44:38.990
<v Speaker 3>straight to base and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2106
01:44:38.991 --> 01:44:43.991
<v Speaker 3>the idea is that the side chain of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>dmt molecule contains a basic nitrogen </v>

2107
01:44:43.991 --> 01:44:48.400
<v Speaker 3>that if it's protonated in an acidic </v>
<v Speaker 3>solution than it's water soluble and if </v>

2108
01:44:49.011 --> 01:44:53.240
<v Speaker 3>it's deprotonated than it's only soluble</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a non polar solvent.</v>

2109
01:44:53.241 --> 01:44:58.241
<v Speaker 3>So what you do is you just deprotonated </v>
<v Speaker 3>the nitrogen with a base potassium </v>

2110
01:44:58.551 --> 01:45:03.551
<v Speaker 3>hydroxide or sodium hydroxide typically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then treat that aqueous basic </v>

2111
01:45:03.551 --> 01:45:08.051
<v Speaker 3>solution with a non polar solvent like </v>
<v Speaker 3>Nafa and isolate the Nafa,</v>

2112
01:45:09.170 --> 01:45:13.100
<v Speaker 3>dry it out and you have your material.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that applies to everything.</v>

2113
01:45:13.101 --> 01:45:16.880
<v Speaker 3>That's not a dmt specific process,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's what people do.</v>

2114
01:45:17.960 --> 01:45:20.270
<v Speaker 3>Everything with the basic nitrogen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

2115
01:45:20.690 --> 01:45:24.080
<v Speaker 3>what's the earliest history of </v>
<v Speaker 3>extraction that we will,</v>

2116
01:45:24.081 --> 01:45:29.081
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first wave of DMT use in the United </v>

2117
01:45:29.081 --> 01:45:29.081
<v Speaker 3>States was all synthetic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

2118
01:45:29.081 --> 01:45:32.280
<v Speaker 3>DMT was discovered synthetically before </v>
<v Speaker 3>it was ever found in nature.</v>

2119
01:45:32.300 --> 01:45:34.030
<v Speaker 3>The same is true of five mg.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Odm called.</v>

2120
01:45:34.090 --> 01:45:39.090
<v Speaker 3>They do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a Canadian chemist named </v>

2121
01:45:39.090 --> 01:45:40.110
<v Speaker 3>Richard Hellmuth Mansky who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2122
01:45:40.310 --> 01:45:45.310
<v Speaker 3>I believe was looking at different </v>
<v Speaker 3>alkaloids and strawberry plants and he </v>

2123
01:45:46.280 --> 01:45:51.280
<v Speaker 3>was synthesizing references for these </v>
<v Speaker 3>potential strawberry alkaloids and made </v>

2124
01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:54.551
<v Speaker 3>dmt so he didn't know what he had made </v>
<v Speaker 3>other than a potential natural product </v>

2125
01:45:54.551 --> 01:45:55.040
<v Speaker 3>found in strawberries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

2126
01:45:55.910 --> 01:46:00.320
<v Speaker 3>and then it wasn't until much later </v>
<v Speaker 3>conducted self experiments with injected</v>

2127
01:46:00.321 --> 01:46:03.610
<v Speaker 3>dmt that people became fully aware of </v>
<v Speaker 3>its psychoactivity.</v>

2128
01:46:03.620 --> 01:46:05.300
<v Speaker 3>And then people started finding it </v>
<v Speaker 3>implants.</v>

2129
01:46:05.450 --> 01:46:06.980
<v Speaker 3>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the 19 fifties where like,</v>

2130
01:46:06.981 --> 01:46:11.981
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an early sixties were of course a </v>

2131
01:46:11.981 --> 01:46:13.691
<v Speaker 3>fascinating time in psychedelic research</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you have these convergences of </v>

2132
01:46:13.691 --> 01:46:13.691
<v Speaker 3>these amazing ideas.</v>

2133
01:46:13.691 --> 01:46:15.380
<v Speaker 3>First you have the discovery of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Serotonin,</v>

2134
01:46:15.710 --> 01:46:17.420
<v Speaker 3>which is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2135
01:46:17.960 --> 01:46:20.540
<v Speaker 3>we take this for granted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now it's in television commercials,</v>

2136
01:46:20.720 --> 01:46:22.910
<v Speaker 3>but this was of course something that no</v>
<v Speaker 3>one knew about it.</v>

2137
01:46:22.911 --> 01:46:25.460
<v Speaker 3>And suddenly they're finding this in all</v>
<v Speaker 3>kinds of different animals.</v>

2138
01:46:25.461 --> 01:46:30.320
<v Speaker 3>Initially it was in the salivary glands </v>
<v Speaker 3>of squid and I'm in different animals.</v>

2139
01:46:30.321 --> 01:46:31.940
<v Speaker 3>Then they're finding it in the human </v>
<v Speaker 3>intestine.</v>

2140
01:46:32.150 --> 01:46:37.150
<v Speaker 3>Then they're also finding that all of </v>
<v Speaker 3>these plants that people worshiped in </v>

2141
01:46:37.150 --> 01:46:40.670
<v Speaker 3>various indigenous societies also </v>
<v Speaker 3>contain serotonin molecules.</v>

2142
01:46:40.671 --> 01:46:45.671
<v Speaker 3>Then they discover lsd and find that </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's maybe the most potent known </v>

2143
01:46:45.671 --> 01:46:49.481
<v Speaker 3>pharmacological agent at that time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it binds to serotonin receptors.</v>

2144
01:46:50.901 --> 01:46:54.680
<v Speaker 3>It activates a Serotonin type response </v>
<v Speaker 3>in isolated tissue.</v>

2145
01:46:54.890 --> 01:46:59.520
<v Speaker 3>So there's like this weird triple </v>
<v Speaker 3>convergence of information.</v>

2146
01:46:59.521 --> 01:47:02.370
<v Speaker 3>Super potent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing compound LSD is discovered,</v>

2147
01:47:02.700 --> 01:47:05.100
<v Speaker 3>Serotonin is discovered and all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>different organisms.</v>

2148
01:47:05.101 --> 01:47:07.470
<v Speaker 3>And there's a pharmacological </v>
<v Speaker 3>convergence between the two of them.</v>

2149
01:47:07.471 --> 01:47:10.440
<v Speaker 3>And then you have all these people </v>
<v Speaker 3>worshiping serotonin molecules.</v>

2150
01:47:10.650 --> 01:47:12.400
<v Speaker 3>So there was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2151
01:47:12.420 --> 01:47:15.960
<v Speaker 3>a lot of enthusiasm at that time to </v>
<v Speaker 3>figure all this out.</v>

2152
01:47:17.390 --> 01:47:22.390
<v Speaker 4>So in terms of history,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so we're talking about somewhere in the </v>

2153
01:47:22.390 --> 01:47:25.901
<v Speaker 4>19 fifties they started extracting tmt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The use of it orally dates back far </v>

2154
01:47:26.810 --> 01:47:31.280
<v Speaker 4>longer than that because of use of Mao </v>
<v Speaker 4>inhibitors and creating Iowasca.</v>

2155
01:47:31.610 --> 01:47:36.610
<v Speaker 4>But in terms of the first extraction,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can kind of implants to smoke.</v>

2156
01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.340
<v Speaker 4>It might've been even later.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It might've been in the eighties.</v>

2157
01:47:40.530 --> 01:47:45.530
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the idea that people thousands of </v>

2158
01:47:45.530 --> 01:47:49.960
<v Speaker 4>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're able to do something along those </v>

2159
01:47:49.960 --> 01:47:52.731
<v Speaker 4>lines is probably probably not accurate </v>
<v Speaker 4>because because they're talking about a </v>

2160
01:47:52.731 --> 01:47:53.790
<v Speaker 4>burning Bush.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why it's appealing to people.</v>

2161
01:47:53.791 --> 01:47:55.690
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The idea of Moses d,</v>

2162
01:47:56.040 --> 01:48:01.040
<v Speaker 4>do you think that maybe the </v>
<v Speaker 4>understanding of synthesis from the </v>

2163
01:48:02.010 --> 01:48:07.010
<v Speaker 4>synthesizing this from these scholars,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe they don't have enough of an </v>

2164
01:48:07.010 --> 01:48:07.440
<v Speaker 4>understanding of chemistry?</v>

2165
01:48:07.850 --> 01:48:12.850
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would be really interesting is to </v>

2166
01:48:12.850 --> 01:48:14.150
<v Speaker 3>do an experiment to see what were the </v>
<v Speaker 3>materials that were available.</v>

2167
01:48:14.151 --> 01:48:17.720
<v Speaker 3>How would this have been done?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would you have to use butter as your non</v>

2168
01:48:17.721 --> 01:48:19.790
<v Speaker 3>polar solvent?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How well would that work?</v>

2169
01:48:19.791 --> 01:48:22.160
<v Speaker 3>What would your butter preparation be </v>
<v Speaker 3>done when you put it?</v>

2170
01:48:22.161 --> 01:48:24.530
<v Speaker 3>Would you take it rectally then?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that how it would work?</v>

2171
01:48:24.531 --> 01:48:26.900
<v Speaker 3>I mean you have to kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What would your base have been?</v>

2172
01:48:27.260 --> 01:48:31.460
<v Speaker 4>They were talking about it being </v>
<v Speaker 4>something from burning a burning Bush.</v>

2173
01:48:31.461 --> 01:48:33.770
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's just one of those things that</v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of gets conflated,</v>

2174
01:48:33.771 --> 01:48:38.771
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because you have people today that are </v>

2175
01:48:38.771 --> 01:48:41.081
<v Speaker 4>very aware that people smoked dmt and </v>
<v Speaker 4>have these incredibly intense religious </v>

2176
01:48:41.081 --> 01:48:44.810
<v Speaker 4>psychedelic experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then maybe they looked at the acacia</v>

2177
01:48:44.811 --> 01:48:45.860
<v Speaker 4>bushes and said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2178
01:48:45.861 --> 01:48:50.861
<v Speaker 4>the acacia bushes rich and DMT.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's probably where the Moses story </v>

2179
01:48:50.861 --> 01:48:51.200
<v Speaker 4>came from.</v>

2180
01:48:51.330 --> 01:48:52.020
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2181
01:48:52.021 --> 01:48:53.260
<v Speaker 3>what's really interesting is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2182
01:48:53.290 --> 01:48:55.290
<v Speaker 3>dmt has never been found in the human </v>
<v Speaker 3>brain,</v>

2183
01:48:55.470 --> 01:48:57.900
<v Speaker 3>even though Rick strassman says that it </v>
<v Speaker 3>has been.</v>

2184
01:48:58.110 --> 01:49:01.410
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people are constantly assigning</v>

2185
01:49:01.411 --> 01:49:06.411
<v Speaker 3>altered states of consciousness to Dmt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we can have these states without </v>

2186
01:49:06.411 --> 01:49:07.030
<v Speaker 3>dmt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2187
01:49:07.031 --> 01:49:08.800
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's never been found in the human</v>
<v Speaker 3>brain,</v>

2188
01:49:08.801 --> 01:49:13.801
<v Speaker 3>but also there's ethical and </v>
<v Speaker 3>experimental issues with sampling fluid </v>

2189
01:49:13.801 --> 01:49:14.510
<v Speaker 3>from the living human brain.</v>

2190
01:49:14.560 --> 01:49:15.310
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it has.</v>

2191
01:49:15.311 --> 01:49:18.720
<v Speaker 4>They have founded in living rats were </v>
<v Speaker 4>fairly recently.</v>

2192
01:49:18.870 --> 01:49:20.980
<v Speaker 4>This is the cottonwood research </v>
<v Speaker 4>foundation.</v>

2193
01:49:20.981 --> 01:49:21.900
<v Speaker 4>That's their.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Their.</v>

2194
01:49:21.910 --> 01:49:26.910
<v Speaker 4>Their attempt is to try to prove that </v>
<v Speaker 4>the pineal gland is a source for DMT.</v>

2195
01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.160
<v Speaker 4>We know that DMT exists in the human </v>
<v Speaker 4>body.</v>

2196
01:49:30.161 --> 01:49:32.840
<v Speaker 4>We know that the liver produces it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we know that the lungs produce it.</v>

2197
01:49:33.130 --> 01:49:38.130
<v Speaker 4>We're not totally aware of whether or </v>
<v Speaker 4>not there's anecdotal evidence that </v>

2198
01:49:38.130 --> 01:49:38.730
<v Speaker 4>points to the pineal gland</v>

2199
01:49:39.600 --> 01:49:44.600
<v Speaker 3>based on the rat idea and based on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>presence of certain enzymes that could </v>

2200
01:49:44.831 --> 01:49:47.170
<v Speaker 3>be responsible for it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but even if it is,</v>

2201
01:49:47.260 --> 01:49:48.670
<v Speaker 3>even if it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then what,</v>

2202
01:49:49.180 --> 01:49:51.850
<v Speaker 3>there's still a whole question of how is</v>
<v Speaker 3>it released,</v>

2203
01:49:51.990 --> 01:49:54.720
<v Speaker 3>how is it distributed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what receptors does it activate in?</v>

2204
01:49:54.721 --> 01:49:59.120
<v Speaker 3>Is it even necessary as an explanation </v>
<v Speaker 3>for altered states of consciousness?</v>

2205
01:49:59.121 --> 01:50:01.670
<v Speaker 3>Because there are other things in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>brain other than dmt.</v>

2206
01:50:01.730 --> 01:50:03.260
<v Speaker 3>DMT has never even been found in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>brain,</v>

2207
01:50:03.261 --> 01:50:04.190
<v Speaker 3>but there are other things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2208
01:50:04.191 --> 01:50:08.570
<v Speaker 3>you have endogenous proteins that bind </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the kappa opioid receptor,</v>

2209
01:50:08.571 --> 01:50:12.260
<v Speaker 3>the same receptor that is responsible </v>
<v Speaker 3>for the effect of Salvia,</v>

2210
01:50:12.620 --> 01:50:13.550
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things like that.</v>

2211
01:50:13.580 --> 01:50:15.010
<v Speaker 3>They were responsible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2212
01:50:15.020 --> 01:50:20.020
<v Speaker 3>even carbon dioxide itself can induce a </v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty strong altered state of </v>

2213
01:50:20.331 --> 01:50:21.110
<v Speaker 3>consciousness.</v>

2214
01:50:21.190 --> 01:50:26.190
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is why people like those </v>

2215
01:50:26.190 --> 01:50:26.190
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic breathing exercises.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2216
01:50:26.420 --> 01:50:28.210
<v Speaker 2>Sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was it like hypoxic?</v>

2217
01:50:28.211 --> 01:50:33.211
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are they doing when they have </v>

2218
01:50:33.211 --> 01:50:33.211
<v Speaker 2>those?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2219
01:50:33.211 --> 01:50:33.280
<v Speaker 2>the what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is it called?</v>

2220
01:50:33.550 --> 01:50:38.110
<v Speaker 2>There's a type of breathing exercise </v>
<v Speaker 2>that induces psychedelic states.</v>

2221
01:50:38.140 --> 01:50:40.330
<v Speaker 2>Holotropic breathwork.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2222
01:50:40.420 --> 01:50:42.250
<v Speaker 2>and that is the idea behind that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2223
01:50:42.251 --> 01:50:44.560
<v Speaker 2>It increases the amount of carbon </v>
<v Speaker 2>dioxide in your blood.</v>

2224
01:50:44.970 --> 01:50:47.160
<v Speaker 3>I haven't seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A mechanistic explanation.</v>

2225
01:50:47.610 --> 01:50:48.090
<v Speaker 3>Hm.</v>

2226
01:50:48.880 --> 01:50:49.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that was,</v>

2227
01:50:50.730 --> 01:50:51.510
<v Speaker 3>but it would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2228
01:50:51.780 --> 01:50:54.570
<v Speaker 3>it would make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In an early LSD psychotherapy,</v>

2229
01:50:54.571 --> 01:50:59.571
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that they would do </v>
<v Speaker 3>before giving someone lsts would give </v>

2230
01:50:59.571 --> 01:51:02.211
<v Speaker 3>them something called carbogen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was a gas that contains carbon </v>

2231
01:51:02.211 --> 01:51:05.541
<v Speaker 3>dioxide and they would look at their </v>
<v Speaker 3>response to the carbon dioxide </v>

2232
01:51:05.541 --> 01:51:06.790
<v Speaker 3>inhalation and if it induced a panic </v>
<v Speaker 3>response,</v>

2233
01:51:06.940 --> 01:51:11.940
<v Speaker 3>they would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe you're not psychologically ready </v>

2234
01:51:11.940 --> 01:51:11.940
<v Speaker 3>for this lsd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's scary.</v>

2235
01:51:12.120 --> 01:51:13.680
<v Speaker 3>So that was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about a test.</v>

2236
01:51:13.890 --> 01:51:18.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean that was a very primitive early </v>
<v Speaker 3>tests that was used by psychiatrists to </v>

2237
01:51:19.071 --> 01:51:23.120
<v Speaker 3>see if people were had this </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychological fortitude to withstand the</v>

2238
01:51:23.121 --> 01:51:23.840
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>

2239
01:51:23.930 --> 01:51:27.320
<v Speaker 2>That's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So tell me more about whatever is in the</v>

2240
01:51:27.321 --> 01:51:29.870
<v Speaker 2>brain that mirrors the effects of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Salvia.</v>

2241
01:51:31.040 --> 01:51:34.280
<v Speaker 3>It's a protein.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember off the top of my head.</v>

2242
01:51:34.310 --> 01:51:39.310
<v Speaker 3>What did you look up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Endogenous ligand for Kappa opioid </v>

2243
01:51:39.310 --> 01:51:39.620
<v Speaker 3>receptor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It will come up.</v>

2244
01:51:39.980 --> 01:51:44.980
<v Speaker 3>David Nichols recently wrote a paper </v>
<v Speaker 3>that actually goes into alternate </v>

2245
01:51:44.980 --> 01:51:48.040
<v Speaker 3>mechanisms of how the DMT type a near </v>
<v Speaker 3>death experience could be produced by </v>

2246
01:51:50.481 --> 01:51:52.730
<v Speaker 3>non dmt compounds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean,</v>

2247
01:51:52.731 --> 01:51:57.731
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a lot of work also on </v>

2248
01:51:57.731 --> 01:51:59.561
<v Speaker 3>endogenous and MDA receptor antagonists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a a protein that was called </v>

2249
01:52:00.760 --> 01:52:05.620
<v Speaker 3>Alpha endo psychosis or Angel Dustin </v>
<v Speaker 3>named after Angel Dust,</v>

2250
01:52:05.920 --> 01:52:08.890
<v Speaker 3>but the main researcher died in a car </v>
<v Speaker 3>accident,</v>

2251
01:52:08.891 --> 01:52:13.330
<v Speaker 3>like right as he was making some kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>breakthrough breakthrough supposedly,</v>

2252
01:52:13.990 --> 01:52:18.430
<v Speaker 3>but I'm q spooky music,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

2253
01:52:18.431 --> 01:52:22.120
<v Speaker 3>there's all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This has been a longstanding question in</v>

2254
01:52:22.121 --> 01:52:25.870
<v Speaker 3>psychiatry is you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what causes psychosis,</v>

2255
01:52:25.900 --> 01:52:27.730
<v Speaker 3>what causes altered states of </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness?</v>

2256
01:52:27.760 --> 01:52:32.760
<v Speaker 3>Is there an endogenous psychedelic?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was one of the major motivations </v>

2257
01:52:32.760 --> 01:52:33.460
<v Speaker 3>for a lot of this research in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sixties.</v>

2258
01:52:33.460 --> 01:52:37.900
<v Speaker 3>Finding the endogenous psychotic and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that is responsible for schizophrenia.</v>

2259
01:52:37.960 --> 01:52:42.160
<v Speaker 3>Now it doesn't seem to be the case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's still a question that comes up.</v>

2260
01:52:42.190 --> 01:52:45.650
<v Speaker 3>What if dopamine is methylated in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain way to create diamonds?</v>

2261
01:52:45.651 --> 01:52:48.680
<v Speaker 3>Oxy Fin ethylamine or what about this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What about that?</v>

2262
01:52:48.681 --> 01:52:50.360
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sheldon was very interested in it,</v>

2263
01:52:50.660 --> 01:52:55.660
<v Speaker 3>but the metabolic production of various </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychedelics that account for altered </v>

2264
01:52:55.660 --> 01:52:59.651
<v Speaker 3>states of consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just hasn't been supported by </v>

2265
01:52:59.651 --> 01:53:02.950
<v Speaker 3>evidence in a very strong way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though people really find the idea </v>

2266
01:53:02.950 --> 01:53:06.140
<v Speaker 3>compelling and there was also the 5 </v>
<v Speaker 3>million dmt and schizophrenia people's </v>

2267
01:53:06.140 --> 01:53:06.140
<v Speaker 3>crn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's also a thing,</v>

2268
01:53:06.140 --> 01:53:11.110
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we know that the body does produce </v>

2269
01:53:11.110 --> 01:53:12.020
<v Speaker 3>five Meo DMT.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just don't know where yet,</v>

2270
01:53:12.021 --> 01:53:17.021
<v Speaker 3>because again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like what I was saying earlier </v>

2271
01:53:17.021 --> 01:53:17.021
<v Speaker 3>about the depression tests where you </v>
<v Speaker 3>look at your urine,</v>

2272
01:53:17.021 --> 01:53:20.780
<v Speaker 3>so you find five Meo dmt in your urine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And your first assumption might be,</v>

2273
01:53:20.870 --> 01:53:23.360
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's five immuno DMT in my body.</v>

2274
01:53:23.361 --> 01:53:28.361
<v Speaker 3>It was in my brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you don't know that it could have </v>

2275
01:53:28.361 --> 01:53:29.870
<v Speaker 3>been biosynthesis in your intestine and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it could have been excluded without ever</v>

2276
01:53:29.871 --> 01:53:31.580
<v Speaker 3>entering your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2277
01:53:31.880 --> 01:53:34.790
<v Speaker 4>This is the whole idea of monoamine </v>
<v Speaker 4>oxidase,</v>

2278
01:53:34.791 --> 01:53:39.791
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The idea that when we're eating things </v>

2279
01:53:39.791 --> 01:53:40.670
<v Speaker 4>that are rich and DMT,</v>
<v Speaker 4>monoamine oxidase is breaking it down in</v>

2280
01:53:40.671 --> 01:53:41.650
<v Speaker 4>the gut.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2281
01:53:42.020 --> 01:53:46.910
<v Speaker 4>So even if you're consuming something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if something is.</v>

2282
01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.040
<v Speaker 4>So how do they know that this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

2283
01:53:49.041 --> 01:53:51.590
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Salvia like substance</v>

2284
01:53:51.750 --> 01:53:54.900
<v Speaker 3>exists in the mind or in the brain </v>
<v Speaker 3>rather because this,</v>

2285
01:53:55.550 --> 01:53:58.230
<v Speaker 3>this peptide or protein has been </v>
<v Speaker 3>isolated.</v>

2286
01:53:58.231 --> 01:54:00.460
<v Speaker 3>Do you find the name of it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2287
01:54:00.640 --> 01:54:02.770
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How I caught four of those words.</v>

2288
01:54:02.771 --> 01:54:06.110
<v Speaker 3>You said I've lost what I was supposed </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be.</v>

2289
01:54:07.410 --> 01:54:07.780
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2290
01:54:09.050 --> 01:54:14.050
<v Speaker 4>so we know there's a host of different </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychoactive substance are absolutely </v>

2291
01:54:14.050 --> 01:54:15.560
<v Speaker 4>produced by the body and in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

2292
01:54:15.590 --> 01:54:16.730
<v Speaker 4>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the brain,</v>

2293
01:54:16.940 --> 01:54:21.940
<v Speaker 4>and that there's different ways that </v>
<v Speaker 4>human beings have been able to achieve </v>

2294
01:54:22.851 --> 01:54:25.910
<v Speaker 4>psychedelic states outside of consuming </v>
<v Speaker 4>drugs.</v>

2295
01:54:26.360 --> 01:54:26.840
<v Speaker 4>Have you</v>

2296
01:54:26.930 --> 01:54:31.090
<v Speaker 3>done that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've done lucid dreaming things.</v>

2297
01:54:31.091 --> 01:54:33.070
<v Speaker 3>I've done Kundalini Yoga</v>

2298
01:54:33.400 --> 01:54:38.400
<v Speaker 4>and one is the one that I'm most </v>
<v Speaker 4>interested in because I have someone </v>

2299
01:54:38.400 --> 01:54:38.770
<v Speaker 4>who's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a friend of mine that got really into it</v>

2300
01:54:39.160 --> 01:54:43.560
<v Speaker 4>and he was saying that he can achieve </v>
<v Speaker 4>very dmt like state</v>

2301
01:54:44.420 --> 01:54:48.820
<v Speaker 3>know is a really interesting aspect of </v>
<v Speaker 3>all of this that isn't often discussed,</v>

2302
01:54:48.821 --> 01:54:53.821
<v Speaker 3>which is the ability to have these </v>
<v Speaker 3>states and still interact with your </v>

2303
01:54:53.821 --> 01:54:54.610
<v Speaker 3>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because of course there's something very</v>

2304
01:54:54.611 --> 01:54:58.840
<v Speaker 3>physically taxing about breath of fire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These Kundalini breathing techniques,</v>

2305
01:54:58.841 --> 01:55:00.550
<v Speaker 3>if you induce an altered state of </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness,</v>

2306
01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:05.560
<v Speaker 3>you need to be focused and you need to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be in a specific place sitting down </v>

2307
01:55:05.560 --> 01:55:09.570
<v Speaker 3>where psychedelics have this amazing </v>
<v Speaker 3>ability to allow you to have that </v>

2308
01:55:09.570 --> 01:55:12.631
<v Speaker 3>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but walk around and I think that's not </v>

2309
01:55:12.631 --> 01:55:16.021
<v Speaker 3>to be underestimated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the walking around because then you can </v>

2310
01:55:16.021 --> 01:55:17.620
<v Speaker 3>really reexamine your environment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a big part of it.</v>

2311
01:55:17.621 --> 01:55:19.720
<v Speaker 3>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a big part of the psychedelic experience</v>

2312
01:55:19.870 --> 01:55:24.870
<v Speaker 3>is seeing what is New York like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do I like or not like about New </v>

2313
01:55:24.870 --> 01:55:29.070
<v Speaker 3>York?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do I like or not like about my </v>

2314
01:55:29.070 --> 01:55:29.070
<v Speaker 3>apartment?</v>
<v Speaker 3>These matters.</v>

2315
01:55:29.070 --> 01:55:29.950
<v Speaker 3>These things matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is your environment.</v>

2316
01:55:29.950 --> 01:55:32.470
<v Speaker 3>Do you want to be surrounded by clutter </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you don't like?</v>

2317
01:55:33.010 --> 01:55:38.010
<v Speaker 3>If you don't get rid of it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are the sorts of thoughts you </v>

2318
01:55:38.010 --> 01:55:38.010
<v Speaker 3>have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is my other issue with going to</v>

2319
01:55:38.010 --> 01:55:41.380
<v Speaker 3>the Peruvian Amazon to have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic experience because if you do</v>

2320
01:55:41.381 --> 01:55:44.550
<v Speaker 3>it in this place that is superficially </v>
<v Speaker 3>inappropriate,</v>

2321
01:55:44.551 --> 01:55:48.760
<v Speaker 3>like your apartment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it has the most applicability to</v>

2322
01:55:48.761 --> 01:55:51.100
<v Speaker 3>your own existence in terms of the music</v>
<v Speaker 3>you listened to,</v>

2323
01:55:51.101 --> 01:55:52.570
<v Speaker 3>your friends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your environment,</v>

2324
01:55:52.690 --> 01:55:57.690
<v Speaker 3>your life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're confronted by the books that you </v>

2325
01:55:57.690 --> 01:55:57.690
<v Speaker 3>read,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the photos of the people that,</v>

2326
01:55:57.690 --> 01:55:59.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the things that matter to you.</v>

2327
01:55:59.080 --> 01:56:04.080
<v Speaker 3>Not a jungle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although jungles are very beautiful and </v>

2328
01:56:04.080 --> 01:56:04.080
<v Speaker 3>visually stimulating and I'm sure and </v>
<v Speaker 3>our,</v>

2329
01:56:04.080 --> 01:56:05.830
<v Speaker 3>I know an amazing place to use </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychedelics.</v>

2330
01:56:06.010 --> 01:56:11.010
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that we underestimate the value </v>

2331
01:56:11.010 --> 01:56:14.221
<v Speaker 3>of these things have been integrated </v>
<v Speaker 3>into a more normal type of experience </v>

2332
01:56:14.221 --> 01:56:17.290
<v Speaker 3>and that's something you can't do as </v>
<v Speaker 3>easily with a Kundalini.</v>

2333
01:56:17.540 --> 01:56:18.320
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2334
01:56:18.321 --> 01:56:21.470
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you're using psychedelics,</v>

2335
01:56:21.500 --> 01:56:24.920
<v Speaker 1>you will use them and walk around New </v>
<v Speaker 1>York City?</v>

2336
01:56:25.430 --> 01:56:27.240
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does that look?</v>

2337
01:56:28.130 --> 01:56:30.270
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I often feel a lot of love for.</v>

2338
01:56:30.320 --> 01:56:30.960
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2339
01:56:30.980 --> 01:56:31.580
<v Speaker 3>Which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2340
01:56:31.610 --> 01:56:36.610
<v Speaker 3>because I think that we also tend to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>into these very angry,</v>

2341
01:56:37.250 --> 01:56:41.140
<v Speaker 3>the subways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>knowing guys taking up too much room.</v>

2342
01:56:41.141 --> 01:56:43.870
<v Speaker 3>I have to stand taking forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It smells weird,</v>

2343
01:56:43.871 --> 01:56:48.871
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone is looking at their phones all </v>

2344
01:56:48.871 --> 01:56:48.871
<v Speaker 3>the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a little bit dark.</v>

2345
01:56:48.871 --> 01:56:50.870
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you know,</v>

2346
01:56:50.920 --> 01:56:54.260
<v Speaker 3>if you're on a low dose of a psychedelic</v>
<v Speaker 3>or even a higher one,</v>

2347
01:56:54.261 --> 01:56:58.450
<v Speaker 3>sometimes I'll look at everyone on their</v>
<v Speaker 3>phones and I'll just feel compassion and</v>

2348
01:56:58.451 --> 01:57:03.451
<v Speaker 3>love and think like what a strange </v>
<v Speaker 3>situation we've all gotten ourselves </v>

2349
01:57:03.451 --> 01:57:04.480
<v Speaker 3>into.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love all these people and it's like,</v>

2350
01:57:05.140 --> 01:57:10.140
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what to say about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I understand that completely and I </v>

2351
01:57:10.140 --> 01:57:13.171
<v Speaker 3>don't know where we're going from here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he suddenly feel connected to </v>

2352
01:57:13.171 --> 01:57:16.861
<v Speaker 3>something that's very real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is people on the subway not </v>

2353
01:57:16.861 --> 01:57:17.090
<v Speaker 3>looking at each other anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2354
01:57:17.110 --> 01:57:22.110
<v Speaker 3>this is in my own life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something that has changed dramatically </v>

2355
01:57:22.110 --> 01:57:22.120
<v Speaker 3>when I moved to New York.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one looked at phones.</v>

2356
01:57:22.121 --> 01:57:25.750
<v Speaker 3>Now people only look at phones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone is looking at phones the entire</v>

2357
01:57:25.751 --> 01:57:29.830
<v Speaker 3>time they're on the subway is a total </v>
<v Speaker 3>change in human behavior.</v>

2358
01:57:30.040 --> 01:57:35.040
<v Speaker 3>And you really start thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>things like that and it matters because </v>

2359
01:57:35.040 --> 01:57:38.340
<v Speaker 3>it's not in the Amazon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's your life and these are the things </v>

2360
01:57:38.340 --> 01:57:41.131
<v Speaker 3>that choices that you make.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you going to be a person that looks </v>

2361
01:57:41.131 --> 01:57:41.131
<v Speaker 3>at their phone all day</v>

2362
01:57:41.131 --> 01:57:41.180
<v Speaker 1>time as well?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2363
01:57:41.181 --> 01:57:43.220
<v Speaker 1>It's fascinating how quickly that took </v>
<v Speaker 1>hold.</v>

2364
01:57:43.770 --> 01:57:45.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at human history,</v>

2365
01:57:45.481 --> 01:57:49.200
<v Speaker 1>when the iphone is 10 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that's really when it started,</v>

2366
01:57:49.201 --> 01:57:51.030
<v Speaker 1>so 10 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people's.</v>

2367
01:57:51.090 --> 01:57:55.140
<v Speaker 1>And even then in the beginning of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>iphone there were fucking useless,</v>

2368
01:57:55.230 --> 01:57:55.590
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2369
01:57:55.591 --> 01:58:00.591
<v Speaker 1>you get online and it was really slow </v>
<v Speaker 1>and terrible and so most of the time we </v>

2370
01:58:00.591 --> 01:58:05.421
<v Speaker 1>just text messages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now with all the apps and social </v>

2371
01:58:05.421 --> 01:58:09.501
<v Speaker 1>media and constant constant updates of </v>
<v Speaker 1>information and new things and new </v>

2372
01:58:10.231 --> 01:58:13.800
<v Speaker 1>events and new trends and it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always calling you.</v>

2373
01:58:13.801 --> 01:58:15.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to check,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make sure everything's done.</v>

2374
01:58:15.510 --> 01:58:17.250
<v Speaker 1>We've been on this podcast for two </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours.</v>

2375
01:58:17.251 --> 01:58:19.590
<v Speaker 1>Let me see what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll look at that.</v>

2376
01:58:19.591 --> 01:58:23.820
<v Speaker 1>All of these messages here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you did it to me.</v>

2377
01:58:23.821 --> 01:58:28.821

<v Speaker 1>I have this vivid memory of standing at </v>

2380
01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.100
<v Speaker 1>You've got to use twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

<v Speaker 1>articles and it's so useful.</v>

<v Speaker 2>it is that way still for me in many </v>

2389
01:58:54.370 --> 01:58:57.371
<v Speaker 2>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I learn a lot about what's going on in </v>

2390
01:58:57.371 --> 01:58:57.371
<v Speaker 2>the world and I follow a lot of science </v>
<v Speaker 2>tweets,</v>

2391
01:58:57.800 --> 01:59:02.800
<v Speaker 2>twitter accounts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of really interesting people </v>

2392
01:59:02.800 --> 01:59:05.741
<v Speaker 2>that post interesting stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you gotta know how to abandon a </v>

2393
01:59:06.681 --> 01:59:09.170
<v Speaker 2>tweet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Several words in like,</v>

2394
01:59:09.260 --> 01:59:11.420
<v Speaker 2>this is bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not reading that.</v>

2395
01:59:11.450 --> 01:59:12.560
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not reading that.</v>

2396
01:59:12.620 --> 01:59:14.090
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what can they do now?</v>

2397
01:59:14.260 --> 01:59:16.010
<v Speaker 2>Teeth are too long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is crazy.</v>

2398
01:59:16.220 --> 01:59:17.060
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not even that.</v>

2399
01:59:17.061 --> 01:59:18.700
<v Speaker 2>It's just knowing that it's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>horse shit.</v>

2400
01:59:18.730 --> 01:59:23.730
<v Speaker 2>This is going to be just either gossip </v>
<v Speaker 2>or nonsense or not interesting,</v>

2401
01:59:24.081 --> 01:59:29.081
<v Speaker 2>but there's still a shit ton of really </v>
<v Speaker 2>useful information that you can get out </v>

2402
01:59:29.081 --> 01:59:32.921
<v Speaker 2>of twitter on a daily basis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's always something new that's </v>

2403
01:59:32.921 --> 01:59:34.880
<v Speaker 2>coming out and I try to retweet those </v>
<v Speaker 2>things as much as possible.</v>

2404
01:59:35.180 --> 01:59:39.080
<v Speaker 2>When I see something that someone sends </v>
<v Speaker 2>me and then that becomes,</v>

2405
01:59:39.230 --> 01:59:40.580
<v Speaker 2>people know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2406
01:59:40.581 --> 01:59:43.760
<v Speaker 2>if you send joe something really cool </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he reads it,</v>

2407
01:59:43.761 --> 01:59:48.761
<v Speaker 2>if I get a chance to read it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll retweet it and people get a kick </v>

2408
01:59:48.761 --> 01:59:49.820
<v Speaker 2>out of that so they'll send me more cool</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff and so then it's sort of.</v>

2409
01:59:50.080 --> 01:59:55.080
<v Speaker 2>It's sort of becomes a like a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>ecosystem almost for disseminating </v>

2410
01:59:55.941 --> 01:59:57.650
<v Speaker 2>interesting ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2411
01:59:58.370 --> 02:00:00.350
<v Speaker 2>That's also bullshit too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of bullshit in there,</v>

2412
02:00:00.990 --> 02:00:02.150
<v Speaker 2>a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of arguing,</v>

2413
02:00:02.151 --> 02:00:04.370
<v Speaker 2>which I don't do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't argue.</v>

2414
02:00:04.550 --> 02:00:07.940
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a very ineffective way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>communicate with people,</v>

2415
02:00:08.200 --> 02:00:11.180
<v Speaker 2>with going back and forth with stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that online.</v>

2416
02:00:11.210 --> 02:00:12.950
<v Speaker 2>It just doesn't work well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

2417
02:00:12.980 --> 02:00:14.090
<v Speaker 2>And it becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

2418
02:00:14.091 --> 02:00:19.091
<v Speaker 2>more like idea sport with a lot of folks</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they're just trying to win these </v>

2419
02:00:19.091 --> 02:00:22.940
<v Speaker 2>little battles and find the whittier </v>
<v Speaker 2>nasty thing to say and it's just,</v>

2420
02:00:23.380 --> 02:00:25.370
<v Speaker 2>it's not productive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not healthy.</v>

2421
02:00:25.371 --> 02:00:26.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't like it.</v>

2422
02:00:26.140 --> 02:00:31.140
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're doing the same thing that </v>

2423
02:00:31.140 --> 02:00:31.140
<v Speaker 3>journalists do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is that you get more attention for</v>

2424
02:00:31.140 --> 02:00:35.491
<v Speaker 3>doing the wrong thing than you do for </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying the right thing and we all know </v>

2425
02:00:35.491 --> 02:00:40.111
<v Speaker 3>that feeling where someone says </v>
<v Speaker 3>something about you that's unfair and </v>

2426
02:00:40.111 --> 02:00:40.111
<v Speaker 3>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you want to say,</v>

2427
02:00:40.111 --> 02:00:41.590
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait a second about that.</v>

2428
02:00:41.591 --> 02:00:45.310
<v Speaker 3>That is totally incorrect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to set the record straight.</v>

2429
02:00:45.910 --> 02:00:49.120
<v Speaker 3>And that's what gets the engagement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not the kind thoughtful,</v>

2430
02:00:49.121 --> 02:00:51.490
<v Speaker 3>considerate thing that somebody says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2431
02:00:51.990 --> 02:00:56.990
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would love to accentuate the trend of </v>

2432
02:00:56.990 --> 02:00:58.460
<v Speaker 2>kindness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really think that that is one thing,</v>

2433
02:00:58.580 --> 02:01:03.580
<v Speaker 2>if there's any one trend and to lean </v>
<v Speaker 2>towards kindness to just to just to be </v>

2434
02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:10.000
<v Speaker 2>nicer to people and if we could all sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of agree that this is a virtue worth </v>

2435
02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:14.260
<v Speaker 2>pursuing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it would change the way human </v>

2436
02:01:14.260 --> 02:01:17.201
<v Speaker 2>beings interact with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These shifts like the shift of looking </v>

2437
02:01:17.201 --> 02:01:20.651
<v Speaker 2>at your phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we could figure out a shift and one </v>

2438
02:01:20.651 --> 02:01:20.870
<v Speaker 2>of the more disturbing things to me that</v>
<v Speaker 2>comes from the left,</v>

2439
02:01:20.871 --> 02:01:25.871
<v Speaker 2>which I've always associated myself with</v>
<v Speaker 2>being a left leaning person that there's</v>

2440
02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:31.000
<v Speaker 2>a lot of meanness coming from the left </v>
<v Speaker 2>now and a lot of lot of by any means </v>

2441
02:01:32.001 --> 02:01:37.001
<v Speaker 2>necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of feeling the need to squash </v>

2442
02:01:37.001 --> 02:01:40.241
<v Speaker 2>people and humiliate people and insult </v>
<v Speaker 2>people because they agree with what you </v>

2443
02:01:40.241 --> 02:01:41.690
<v Speaker 2>believe and that this.</v>

2444
02:01:42.470 --> 02:01:47.470
<v Speaker 2>This is a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this is a terrible path to go </v>

2445
02:01:47.470 --> 02:01:50.090
<v Speaker 2>down because then it sort of justifies </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who think the opposite of that to</v>

2446
02:01:50.091 --> 02:01:55.091
<v Speaker 2>be mean to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now no one's getting anything done </v>

2447
02:01:55.091 --> 02:01:57.940
<v Speaker 2>because this side's being insulting and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that side's being insulting and people </v>

2448
02:01:57.940 --> 02:02:02.171
<v Speaker 2>are getting kicked out of restaurants </v>
<v Speaker 2>and people are protesting in front of </v>

2449
02:02:02.171 --> 02:02:05.231
<v Speaker 2>people's houses because they disagree </v>
<v Speaker 2>with things and he says a lot of </v>

2450
02:02:05.231 --> 02:02:06.260
<v Speaker 2>cruelty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of like meanness and cruelty,</v>

2451
02:02:06.261 --> 02:02:11.261
<v Speaker 2>which is the enemy of discourse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As soon as that stuff gets thrown about </v>

2452
02:02:11.720 --> 02:02:15.020
<v Speaker 2>and soon as it becomes a war and idea of</v>
<v Speaker 2>war or an idea sport,</v>

2453
02:02:15.170 --> 02:02:20.170
<v Speaker 2>people are just trying to win and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to get back at you for what you </v>

2454
02:02:20.170 --> 02:02:23.051
<v Speaker 2>said and you get back at them for that </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it becomes this terrible stall out </v>

2455
02:02:23.051 --> 02:02:23.510
<v Speaker 2>situation.</v>

2456
02:02:23.600 --> 02:02:28.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've all bought into a game and it's a </v>

2457
02:02:28.600 --> 02:02:30.791
<v Speaker 3>bad game to play.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the worst possible game and it's </v>

2458
02:02:30.791 --> 02:02:34.930
<v Speaker 3>very transparent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you look at what shows up on the </v>

2459
02:02:34.930 --> 02:02:38.051
<v Speaker 3>first page of twitter and it's things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are perfectly designed to generate </v>

2460
02:02:38.051 --> 02:02:41.720
<v Speaker 3>opinions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So teacher says that now classrooms will</v>

2461
02:02:41.721 --> 02:02:46.721
<v Speaker 3>be equipped with a bucket of stones to </v>
<v Speaker 3>throw at a school shooter and what do </v>

2462
02:02:46.721 --> 02:02:47.000
<v Speaker 3>you feel?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2463
02:02:47.001 --> 02:02:48.140
<v Speaker 3>that's stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or Hey,</v>

2464
02:02:48.141 --> 02:02:53.141
<v Speaker 3>that's actually kind of a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's better than nothing and everyone's </v>

2465
02:02:53.141 --> 02:02:53.690
<v Speaker 3>engaging with it and you're buying into </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2466
02:02:53.691 --> 02:02:56.240
<v Speaker 3>You're supporting it and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>promoting it and you're making it bigger</v>

2467
02:02:56.270 --> 02:02:57.830
<v Speaker 3>by paying attention to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2468
02:02:57.831 --> 02:03:02.831
<v Speaker 3>there's an amazing book that I recommend</v>
<v Speaker 3>anyone listening to this read called </v>

2469
02:03:02.831 --> 02:03:02.960
<v Speaker 3>amusing ourselves to death by Neil </v>
<v Speaker 3>Postman,</v>

2470
02:03:03.080 --> 02:03:07.010
<v Speaker 3>which he wrote in 1985 before computers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>before social media,</v>

2471
02:03:07.011 --> 02:03:12.011
<v Speaker 3>before any of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He predicts all of it perfectly without </v>

2472
02:03:12.011 --> 02:03:14.531
<v Speaker 3>even knowing the faintest hint of what </v>
<v Speaker 3>was going to happen and you know his </v>

2473
02:03:15.470 --> 02:03:20.470
<v Speaker 3>solution if there is one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is you know partially to disengage from </v>

2474
02:03:20.470 --> 02:03:22.820
<v Speaker 3>all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to try to appreciate long,</v>

2475
02:03:22.850 --> 02:03:27.850
<v Speaker 3>nuanced,</v>
<v Speaker 3>careful things which is very hard to </v>

2476
02:03:27.850 --> 02:03:27.850
<v Speaker 3>achieve on twitter or</v>

2477
02:03:27.940 --> 02:03:30.370
<v Speaker 2>television or most places will try our </v>
<v Speaker 2>best.</v>

2478
02:03:30.730 --> 02:03:35.730
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's one of the reasons why </v>

2479
02:03:35.730 --> 02:03:37.501
<v Speaker 2>podcasts like especially ones like this </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are these long form conversations </v>

2480
02:03:38.140 --> 02:03:43.140
<v Speaker 2>are becoming popular because people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>hungry for actual communication and </v>

2481
02:03:43.140 --> 02:03:46.120
<v Speaker 2>they're hungry for people that are just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if we disagree on things.</v>

2482
02:03:46.121 --> 02:03:50.560
<v Speaker 2>I want to know why you think the way you</v>
<v Speaker 2>think and I want to hear it all.</v>

2483
02:03:50.590 --> 02:03:55.590
<v Speaker 2>I want to hear all of your reasoning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to hear the thought process that </v>

2484
02:03:55.590 --> 02:04:00.001
<v Speaker 2>led you to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to hear that and I want to be </v>

2485
02:04:00.001 --> 02:04:02.701
<v Speaker 2>able to talk to you about how I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>and why I think the way I think and </v>

2486
02:04:02.701 --> 02:04:06.481
<v Speaker 2>maybe we can come to some middle ground </v>
<v Speaker 2>or at least understand each other and </v>

2487
02:04:06.481 --> 02:04:06.481
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2488
02:04:06.481 --> 02:04:08.020
<v Speaker 2>I've seen where you went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or I see why you do.</v>

2489
02:04:08.170 --> 02:04:13.170
<v Speaker 2>I see what's happening inside your mind </v>
<v Speaker 2>or the way you feel or how it relates to</v>

2490
02:04:13.481 --> 02:04:14.020
<v Speaker 2>your life.</v>

2491
02:04:14.170 --> 02:04:18.370
<v Speaker 2>This is absent in most discourse on </v>
<v Speaker 2>television.</v>

2492
02:04:18.910 --> 02:04:22.480
<v Speaker 2>It's absent in all talk shows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like what we're talking about,</v>

2493
02:04:22.490 --> 02:04:25.110
<v Speaker 2>the oddness of a panel show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2494
02:04:25.210 --> 02:04:27.550
<v Speaker 2>they're so bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make any sense.</v>

2495
02:04:27.760 --> 02:04:32.760
<v Speaker 2>None of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not how human beings interact with </v>

2496
02:04:32.760 --> 02:04:36.361
<v Speaker 2>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you imagine if every conversation </v>

2497
02:04:36.361 --> 02:04:38.281
<v Speaker 2>you had in your life there was an </v>
<v Speaker 2>audience clapping or we'll wing at </v>

2498
02:04:38.281 --> 02:04:41.641
<v Speaker 2>everything said you'd mean it creates </v>
<v Speaker 2>this sort of fake way of communication </v>

2499
02:04:44.251 --> 02:04:47.010
<v Speaker 2>that has become so commonplace with us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just.</v>

2500
02:04:47.011 --> 02:04:50.370
<v Speaker 2>Even the way they sit sitting next to </v>
<v Speaker 2>each other like this,</v>

2501
02:04:50.550 --> 02:04:55.550
<v Speaker 2>like we're not looking at each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would be sitting over here and you'd </v>

2502
02:04:55.550 --> 02:04:55.550
<v Speaker 2>be at the desk and I build,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2503
02:04:55.550 --> 02:04:57.450
<v Speaker 2>Hamilton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>funny you bring that up,</v>

2504
02:04:57.600 --> 02:04:59.550
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at the crowd.</v>

2505
02:04:59.551 --> 02:05:00.330
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2506
02:05:01.020 --> 02:05:06.020
<v Speaker 2>it's alien.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really weird and I think because of</v>

2507
02:05:06.061 --> 02:05:11.061
<v Speaker 2>the fact that people are so addicted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>their phones and addicted to media and </v>

2508
02:05:11.061 --> 02:05:13.950
<v Speaker 2>this constant influx of this loop of </v>
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>

2509
02:05:13.950 --> 02:05:18.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you watch the news,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can't just give you the fucking </v>

2510
02:05:18.950 --> 02:05:21.411
<v Speaker 2>news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to get that scroll on the </v>

2511
02:05:21.411 --> 02:05:21.411
<v Speaker 2>bottom of other shit that you should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>freaking out about.</v>

2512
02:05:21.411 --> 02:05:23.010
<v Speaker 2>It's like the news itself is not enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2513
02:05:23.011 --> 02:05:27.560
<v Speaker 2>You have to know about terrorist attacks</v>
<v Speaker 2>and fucking Isis and new,</v>

2514
02:05:27.570 --> 02:05:32.570
<v Speaker 2>some new flu that can't be cured and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all scrolling on the bottom while </v>

2515
02:05:32.570 --> 02:05:34.890
<v Speaker 2>you're watching other shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We was.</v>

2516
02:05:34.940 --> 02:05:37.200
<v Speaker 2>This is not how human beings are </v>
<v Speaker 2>designed.</v>

2517
02:05:37.230 --> 02:05:42.230
<v Speaker 2>We're designed to talk or designed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>communicate with each other person to </v>

2518
02:05:42.230 --> 02:05:44.040
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what we're good at.</v>

2519
02:05:44.430 --> 02:05:49.430
<v Speaker 2>This is what we've lost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the one thing that has probably lead</v>

2520
02:05:49.770 --> 02:05:51.990
<v Speaker 2>to more people understanding more about </v>
<v Speaker 2>each other.</v>

2521
02:05:52.320 --> 02:05:56.400
<v Speaker 2>Actual conversations is rare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really weird.</v>

2522
02:05:56.640 --> 02:05:59.700
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's way more common for someone to look</v>

2523
02:05:59.701 --> 02:06:03.510
<v Speaker 2>at their phone for 10 hours a day that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it is for someone to have a one-on-one,</v>

2524
02:06:03.900 --> 02:06:06.360
<v Speaker 2>uninterrupted conversation with someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>for an hour.</v>

2525
02:06:07.200 --> 02:06:09.720
<v Speaker 2>Those don't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't exist with lovers.</v>

2526
02:06:09.930 --> 02:06:13.170
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>With lovers and occasionally with if you</v>

2527
02:06:13.171 --> 02:06:18.171
<v Speaker 2>have polite dinner companions that put </v>
<v Speaker 2>their phone down and just drink a glass </v>

2528
02:06:18.271 --> 02:06:21.960
<v Speaker 2>of wine and talk to you about stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but even then people suck at it.</v>

2529
02:06:22.680 --> 02:06:24.630
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like people forgot how to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2530
02:06:24.900 --> 02:06:27.480
<v Speaker 2>They talk over each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't listen to each other.</v>

2531
02:06:27.481 --> 02:06:30.240
<v Speaker 2>When the other person's talking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just waiting their turn and talk.</v>

2532
02:06:30.720 --> 02:06:35.720
<v Speaker 2>It's a we're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going down weird roads that these </v>

2533
02:06:35.720 --> 02:06:40.191
<v Speaker 2>roads where we're sort of distancing </v>
<v Speaker 2>ourselves from compassion and </v>

2534
02:06:40.261 --> 02:06:43.920
<v Speaker 2>understanding and real communication.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

2535
02:06:45.180 --> 02:06:46.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what to do about it either.</v>

2536
02:06:48.990 --> 02:06:51.750
<v Speaker 2>Psychedelics might help.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm saying.</v>

2537
02:06:51.870 --> 02:06:54.240
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they would help.</v>

2538
02:06:54.540 --> 02:06:59.540
<v Speaker 2>I think if we had like real centers </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you could go and just like you </v>

2539
02:07:00.211 --> 02:07:05.211
<v Speaker 2>could go to a place where you can get a </v>
<v Speaker 2>licensed therapist to massage you.</v>

2540
02:07:07.070 --> 02:07:07.740
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2541
02:07:07.741 --> 02:07:12.720
<v Speaker 2>I've gotten this back pole and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only thing that works is deep tissue</v>

2542
02:07:12.721 --> 02:07:14.250
<v Speaker 2>massage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go to a place,</v>

2543
02:07:14.370 --> 02:07:19.370
<v Speaker 2>they give you a robe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they played nice music that give you </v>

2544
02:07:19.370 --> 02:07:22.611
<v Speaker 2>team and they're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're setting the set and see the </v>

2545
02:07:22.611 --> 02:07:22.790
<v Speaker 2>setting and the the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2546
02:07:23.040 --> 02:07:25.150
<v Speaker 2>the ambience of the room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2547
02:07:25.160 --> 02:07:30.160
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it enhances the experience of getting </v>

2548
02:07:30.160 --> 02:07:30.160
<v Speaker 2>the massage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you go into the room,</v>

2549
02:07:30.160 --> 02:07:32.190
<v Speaker 2>the lights are down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They might have a candle lit,</v>

2550
02:07:32.430 --> 02:07:37.430
<v Speaker 2>you know there's some fucking hot rocks </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the place and they're playing </v>

2551
02:07:37.430 --> 02:07:41.970
<v Speaker 2>beautiful harp music in the background.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The set and setting is a part of the </v>

2552
02:07:41.970 --> 02:07:46.060
<v Speaker 2>experience of getting a massage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we could have something like that and</v>

2553
02:07:46.061 --> 02:07:50.880
<v Speaker 2>have these things common for the use of </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychedelics where you could go to a,</v>

2554
02:07:51.170 --> 02:07:53.140
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an actual,</v>

2555
02:07:53.170 --> 02:07:57.280
<v Speaker 2>some sort of therapist that's trained in</v>
<v Speaker 2>both psychotherapy,</v>

2556
02:07:57.340 --> 02:08:02.340
<v Speaker 2>in the use of psychedelics so they could</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk to you and find out if you're </v>

2557
02:08:02.340 --> 02:08:06.121
<v Speaker 2>stable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ask you questions about your medical </v>

2558
02:08:06.121 --> 02:08:08.941
<v Speaker 2>history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what kind of medications or you're on </v>

2559
02:08:08.941 --> 02:08:08.941
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how you feeling,</v>

2560
02:08:08.941 --> 02:08:11.330
<v Speaker 2>what are you trying to achieve through </v>
<v Speaker 2>this and then work you through.</v>

2561
02:08:11.331 --> 02:08:16.331
<v Speaker 2>An experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this can be enormously </v>

2562
02:08:16.331 --> 02:08:16.331
<v Speaker 2>beneficial.</v>

2563
02:08:16.331 --> 02:08:18.160
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure it already has been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2564
02:08:18.161 --> 02:08:23.161
<v Speaker 3>that's you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We keep talking about psychedelic </v>

2565
02:08:23.161 --> 02:08:23.161
<v Speaker 3>medicine all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but so much of this has been done.</v>

2566
02:08:23.161 --> 02:08:25.810
<v Speaker 3>That's the really crazy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I became used to be a pharmaceutical and</v>

2567
02:08:25.811 --> 02:08:30.811
<v Speaker 3>France.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Although as using lower doses that </v>

2568
02:08:30.811 --> 02:08:30.811
<v Speaker 3>weren't psychedelic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there used to be an mdms.</v>

2569
02:08:30.811 --> 02:08:34.870
<v Speaker 3>Are they using it for as like a tonic to</v>
<v Speaker 3>stimulate people?</v>

2570
02:08:36.190 --> 02:08:37.520
<v Speaker 3>It was called Lam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Berean,</v>

2571
02:08:37.610 --> 02:08:42.610
<v Speaker 3>eight milligram tablets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is an effective dose threshold </v>

2572
02:08:42.610 --> 02:08:46.460
<v Speaker 3>psychoactivity in my experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about 20 milligrams of the hydrochloride</v>

2573
02:08:46.461 --> 02:08:48.930
<v Speaker 3>salt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there were microdosing there.</v>

2574
02:08:48.980 --> 02:08:52.070
<v Speaker 3>There were many microdosing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>microdosing,</v>

2575
02:08:52.130 --> 02:08:54.200
<v Speaker 3>Ibogaine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They may have used multiple tablets.</v>

2576
02:08:54.201 --> 02:08:58.760
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if anyone is familiar with </v>
<v Speaker 3>French historical literature relating to</v>

2577
02:08:58.761 --> 02:09:00.110
<v Speaker 3>Ibogaine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a little bit of it,</v>

2578
02:09:00.111 --> 02:09:01.340
<v Speaker 3>but there isn't much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2579
02:09:01.341 --> 02:09:06.341
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they used to use a psychedelic called </v>

2580
02:09:06.341 --> 02:09:06.560
<v Speaker 3>Indo pan as an antidepressant and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Soviet Union in the United States,</v>

2581
02:09:06.561 --> 02:09:11.561
<v Speaker 3>there was a drug called Monet's Alpha.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ethel tryptamine was used as an </v>

2582
02:09:11.561 --> 02:09:11.561
<v Speaker 3>antidepressant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an MDM type,</v>

2583
02:09:11.561 --> 02:09:13.100
<v Speaker 3>serotonin releaser.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then of course,</v>

2584
02:09:13.101 --> 02:09:15.960
<v Speaker 3>the whole history of dpt facilitated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2585
02:09:16.050 --> 02:09:17.750
<v Speaker 3>end of life therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lsd,</v>

2586
02:09:17.751 --> 02:09:19.790
<v Speaker 3>psychotherapy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and on,</v>

2587
02:09:19.791 --> 02:09:24.791
<v Speaker 3>and on it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything shoguns group did using two </v>

2588
02:09:24.791 --> 02:09:26.710
<v Speaker 3>CB MMDA Ibogaine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2589
02:09:26.840 --> 02:09:30.860
<v Speaker 3>this was along with Claudio Naranjo in </v>
<v Speaker 3>order to facilitate psychotherapy.</v>

2590
02:09:30.861 --> 02:09:33.350
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people not only were doing it,</v>

2591
02:09:33.500 --> 02:09:36.080
<v Speaker 3>they were exploring all the different </v>
<v Speaker 3>ways to do it,</v>

2592
02:09:36.081 --> 02:09:39.190
<v Speaker 3>which compounds are best for which </v>
<v Speaker 3>applications.</v>

2593
02:09:39.870 --> 02:09:40.320
<v Speaker 3>Hm.</v>

2594
02:09:41.090 --> 02:09:43.480
<v Speaker 2>Do you have any experience with cacao?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2595
02:09:44.170 --> 02:09:49.170
<v Speaker 2>What is your experience in terms of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic effects or psychoactive </v>

2596
02:09:49.170 --> 02:09:49.170
<v Speaker 2>effects?</v>

2597
02:09:49.170 --> 02:09:53.500
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's mildly stimulating because of the </v>

2598
02:09:53.500 --> 02:09:53.500
<v Speaker 3>theobromine content.</v>

2599
02:09:53.500 --> 02:09:56.430
<v Speaker 2>But does it mirror a small dose of Mtma </v>
<v Speaker 2>or not?</v>

2600
02:09:56.431 --> 02:09:57.550
<v Speaker 2>In my experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2601
02:09:58.350 --> 02:10:00.000
<v Speaker 2>it was kyle that was talking about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2602
02:10:00.001 --> 02:10:05.001
<v Speaker 2>Carl Kingsburg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was saying that in large doses that </v>

2603
02:10:05.001 --> 02:10:08.480
<v Speaker 2>rock cow has some sort of a mild mtma </v>
<v Speaker 2>like effect.</v>

2604
02:10:08.750 --> 02:10:13.750
<v Speaker 3>I've heard people say that and people </v>
<v Speaker 3>will sometimes say that the presence of </v>

2605
02:10:13.750 --> 02:10:15.260
<v Speaker 3>fin ethylamine in Cacao could account </v>
<v Speaker 3>for that,</v>

2606
02:10:15.261 --> 02:10:19.140
<v Speaker 3>but it's such a small amount.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Race quantity is less than a milligram.</v>

2607
02:10:19.290 --> 02:10:24.290
<v Speaker 3>And the active dose of Finesse woman is </v>
<v Speaker 3>hundreds of kilograms or grams in order </v>

2608
02:10:24.290 --> 02:10:27.981
<v Speaker 3>to achieve a psychoactive effect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think the effect that people do </v>

2609
02:10:27.981 --> 02:10:29.880
<v Speaker 3>experience is probably mediated by </v>
<v Speaker 3>theobromine,</v>

2610
02:10:29.881 --> 02:10:33.830
<v Speaker 3>which is present in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a relatively high quantities.</v>

2611
02:10:33.831 --> 02:10:34.750
<v Speaker 3>That's how the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2612
02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:36.830
<v Speaker 3>it's named after the genus Theobroma</v>

2613
02:10:37.270 --> 02:10:40.420
<v Speaker 2>and theobromine does what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how does it make you feel?</v>

2614
02:10:40.500 --> 02:10:42.570
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a caffeine type stimulant.</v>

2615
02:10:42.970 --> 02:10:45.660
<v Speaker 3>So when people say that chocolate </v>
<v Speaker 3>contains caffeine,</v>

2616
02:10:45.690 --> 02:10:47.910
<v Speaker 3>what they're really referring to </v>
<v Speaker 3>theobromine.</v>

2617
02:10:48.360 --> 02:10:51.000
<v Speaker 3>And is that why it's deadly to dogs?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes it is.</v>

2618
02:10:52.090 --> 02:10:55.170
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's theobromine that's doing it.</v>

2619
02:10:55.230 --> 02:10:56.580
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fascinating.</v>

2620
02:10:56.910 --> 02:11:00.660
<v Speaker 2>So it's not actually caffeine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No caffeine like substance.</v>

2621
02:11:00.661 --> 02:11:05.661
<v Speaker 2>It's less potent than coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what was your experience like </v>

2622
02:11:05.661 --> 02:11:05.661
<v Speaker 2>physically?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did you feel when you took this?</v>

2623
02:11:05.661 --> 02:11:07.260
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this Cacao and whatnot?</v>

2624
02:11:07.380 --> 02:11:08.220
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>

2625
02:11:08.240 --> 02:11:09.330
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how large dose?</v>

2626
02:11:09.900 --> 02:11:12.660
<v Speaker 3>I mean I used to eat it every day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

2627
02:11:12.670 --> 02:11:17.670
<v Speaker 3>Raw powders?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The powder you did everyday and yogurt </v>

2628
02:11:17.820 --> 02:11:20.550
<v Speaker 3>and I'm just as a health thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2629
02:11:20.551 --> 02:11:24.230
<v Speaker 3>as a health thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I liked the flavor of it,</v>

2630
02:11:24.440 --> 02:11:27.530
<v Speaker 3>but I have never had an experience </v>
<v Speaker 3>beyond,</v>

2631
02:11:27.531 --> 02:11:30.320
<v Speaker 3>at most a low level stimulant </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>

2632
02:11:30.321 --> 02:11:33.950
<v Speaker 3>And I've also taken pure theobromine and</v>
<v Speaker 3>is stimulating,</v>

2633
02:11:33.951 --> 02:11:36.530
<v Speaker 3>but it requires 500 milligrams to </v>
<v Speaker 3>achieve an effect.</v>

2634
02:11:36.531 --> 02:11:37.550
<v Speaker 3>If I remember correctly,</v>

2635
02:11:39.380 --> 02:11:40.400
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what other,</v>

2636
02:11:40.500 --> 02:11:41.480
<v Speaker 2>what about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2637
02:11:41.870 --> 02:11:43.130
<v Speaker 2>you ever fuck with nutmeg?</v>

2638
02:11:44.260 --> 02:11:44.950
<v Speaker 3>Nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2639
02:11:44.951 --> 02:11:47.110
<v Speaker 3>it's a fascinating area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2640
02:11:47.290 --> 02:11:48.050
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2641
02:11:48.130 --> 02:11:53.130
<v Speaker 3>prisoners historically did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Malcolm x did it and the essential oil </v>

2642
02:11:53.151 --> 02:11:58.151
<v Speaker 3>of nutmeg contains Marista seven,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a precursor for the psychedelic</v>

2643
02:11:58.811 --> 02:12:01.390
<v Speaker 3>amphetamine MMDA,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not Mtma,</v>

2644
02:12:01.391 --> 02:12:03.010
<v Speaker 3>but it's methoxy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>MDA,</v>

2645
02:12:03.400 --> 02:12:08.400
<v Speaker 3>and as well as lme sin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is another psychedelic precursor </v>

2646
02:12:09.640 --> 02:12:11.650
<v Speaker 3>as well as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2647
02:12:11.710 --> 02:12:13.800
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think one other maybe even sap role.</v>

2648
02:12:13.810 --> 02:12:14.890
<v Speaker 3>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's saffron.</v>

2649
02:12:14.920 --> 02:12:18.700
<v Speaker 3>Lms and Morrison and Shogun had a </v>
<v Speaker 3>hypothesis.</v>

2650
02:12:18.790 --> 02:12:23.790
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shogun was actually by training a </v>

2651
02:12:23.790 --> 02:12:23.790
<v Speaker 3>biochemist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not an organic chemist,</v>

2652
02:12:23.790 --> 02:12:24.910
<v Speaker 3>although he spent his career doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>organic chemistry.</v>

2653
02:12:24.911 --> 02:12:28.570
<v Speaker 3>So he was very interested in these ideas</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the body creating psychedelics.</v>

2654
02:12:28.690 --> 02:12:33.220
<v Speaker 3>So he thought when you consume nutmeg </v>
<v Speaker 3>oil that your body is,</v>

2655
02:12:33.610 --> 02:12:38.610
<v Speaker 3>is emanating this double bond and </v>
<v Speaker 3>creating a series of different </v>

2656
02:12:38.610 --> 02:12:40.270
<v Speaker 3>amphetamines and that's what accounts </v>
<v Speaker 3>for the high.</v>

2657
02:12:40.570 --> 02:12:42.670
<v Speaker 3>But in reality people don't actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>know.</v>

2658
02:12:43.310 --> 02:12:44.200
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2659
02:12:45.920 --> 02:12:50.920
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what kind of history of use the does </v>

2660
02:12:50.920 --> 02:12:54.280
<v Speaker 2>it have in terms of like people taking </v>
<v Speaker 2>it for the psychoactive benefits?</v>

2661
02:12:54.990 --> 02:12:58.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure there is some ancient.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You or I would be,</v>

2662
02:12:58.551 --> 02:13:00.680
<v Speaker 3>I would assume there is some ancient use</v>
<v Speaker 3>of it,</v>

2663
02:13:00.681 --> 02:13:01.760
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2664
02:13:01.780 --> 02:13:05.570
<v Speaker 3>it's mostly like a thing for teenagers </v>
<v Speaker 3>and people in prison these days.</v>

2665
02:13:05.571 --> 02:13:07.400
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's illegal high.</v>

2666
02:13:07.401 --> 02:13:09.950
<v Speaker 3>It's one of these things that you do </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you don't have access to,</v>

2667
02:13:10.210 --> 02:13:15.210
<v Speaker 3>to anything else and most of the reports</v>
<v Speaker 3>make it sound more like an </v>

2668
02:13:15.210 --> 02:13:17.000
<v Speaker 3>anticholinergic delirium type </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>

2669
02:13:17.001 --> 02:13:22.001
<v Speaker 3>More like taking a lot of drama mean </v>
<v Speaker 3>then that like a classical psychedelic </v>

2670
02:13:22.001 --> 02:13:25.931
<v Speaker 3>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can use that oil to make a lot </v>

2671
02:13:25.931 --> 02:13:26.540
<v Speaker 3>of psychedelics in a laboratory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2672
02:13:27.360 --> 02:13:30.060
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>history of use as well also,</v>

2673
02:13:30.061 --> 02:13:32.010
<v Speaker 2>so fascinating me when you talk about</v>

2674
02:13:32.010 --> 02:13:37.010
<v Speaker 4>history of use because um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are certain cultures that really </v>

2675
02:13:37.010 --> 02:13:38.070
<v Speaker 4>don't have a written history.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have oral history.</v>

2676
02:13:38.300 --> 02:13:41.430
<v Speaker 4>So it's very difficult to determine when</v>
<v Speaker 4>people started.</v>

2677
02:13:42.680 --> 02:13:43.250
<v Speaker 3>What about</v>

2678
02:13:43.630 --> 02:13:46.440
<v Speaker 4>pod?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is the history of use of peo?</v>

2679
02:13:46.530 --> 02:13:51.530
<v Speaker 4>Because I remember reading something </v>
<v Speaker 4>that kind of stunned me that said that </v>

2680
02:13:51.530 --> 02:13:54.520
<v Speaker 4>there's only like a couple hundred years</v>
<v Speaker 4>have known use of pod.</v>

2681
02:13:54.590 --> 02:13:55.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2682
02:13:55.191 --> 02:14:00.191
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's different histories because </v>

2683
02:14:00.191 --> 02:14:02.030
<v Speaker 3>pot is used,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it grows naturally over a relatively </v>

2684
02:14:02.030 --> 02:14:06.160
<v Speaker 3>broad region.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stretching from the southern United </v>

2685
02:14:06.160 --> 02:14:07.100
<v Speaker 3>States into,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe mostly northern Mexico.</v>

2686
02:14:07.370 --> 02:14:12.370
<v Speaker 3>And so in the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the history is about 100 years old of </v>

2687
02:14:15.071 --> 02:14:17.410
<v Speaker 3>the native American church is its </v>
<v Speaker 3>recent.</v>

2688
02:14:17.670 --> 02:14:19.240
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's crazy.</v>

2689
02:14:19.241 --> 02:14:21.070
<v Speaker 3>So 19,</v>
<v Speaker 3>18,</v>

2690
02:14:21.220 --> 02:14:23.180
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2691
02:14:23.240 --> 02:14:24.320
<v Speaker 3>It was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2692
02:14:24.640 --> 02:14:27.520
<v Speaker 3>a comanche chief named Quanah Parker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2693
02:14:27.650 --> 02:14:32.650
<v Speaker 3>who spread the pod religion across the </v>
<v Speaker 3>United States and it caught on because </v>

2694
02:14:32.811 --> 02:14:35.780
<v Speaker 3>it's fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course it caught on.</v>

2695
02:14:36.030 --> 02:14:37.680
<v Speaker 3>I've never experienced it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it like,</v>

2696
02:14:38.180 --> 02:14:39.350
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well again,</v>

2697
02:14:39.351 --> 02:14:42.890
<v Speaker 3>it's another one of these plants that </v>
<v Speaker 3>has masculine of course,</v>

2698
02:14:42.891 --> 02:14:46.490
<v Speaker 3>but then it has these other accessory </v>
<v Speaker 3>alkaloids that modulate the experience.</v>

2699
02:14:46.491 --> 02:14:51.491
<v Speaker 3>So what's really interesting about pod </v>
<v Speaker 3>is it contains this chemical called peo </v>

2700
02:14:51.491 --> 02:14:53.120
<v Speaker 3>teen and Payoti and I have some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2701
02:14:53.270 --> 02:14:57.820
<v Speaker 3>pharmacy trade journals from like 1890 </v>
<v Speaker 3>or something like that.</v>

2702
02:14:57.860 --> 02:15:02.860
<v Speaker 3>Know maybe it must be later than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It must be maybe like 1915 or something </v>

2703
02:15:02.860 --> 02:15:04.000
<v Speaker 3>like that sometime around there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they talk about like,</v>

2704
02:15:04.030 --> 02:15:08.500
<v Speaker 3>your pharmacy must have morphine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cocaine and peo team,</v>

2705
02:15:08.530 --> 02:15:12.310
<v Speaker 3>the three substances every pharmacist </v>
<v Speaker 3>needs and uh,</v>

2706
02:15:12.530 --> 02:15:14.890
<v Speaker 3>and pot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And was used as a hypnotic.</v>

2707
02:15:14.891 --> 02:15:19.891
<v Speaker 3>It was used to induce sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's been no very little research</v>

2708
02:15:20.421 --> 02:15:22.190
<v Speaker 3>on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>None of the 21st century.</v>

2709
02:15:22.191 --> 02:15:23.570
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is like a,</v>

2710
02:15:23.590 --> 02:15:25.640
<v Speaker 3>it was once considered a really valuable</v>
<v Speaker 3>medicine.</v>

2711
02:15:25.641 --> 02:15:28.910
<v Speaker 3>The issues that it's a little bit tricky</v>
<v Speaker 3>to synthesize and it has to be extracted</v>

2712
02:15:28.911 --> 02:15:31.230
<v Speaker 3>from this rare cactus Luftwaffe for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>diffuser.</v>

2713
02:15:31.640 --> 02:15:32.660
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2714
02:15:32.750 --> 02:15:36.560
<v Speaker 3>but that modulates the experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have so many different alkaloids and</v>

2715
02:15:36.561 --> 02:15:38.480
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it,</v>

2716
02:15:38.940 --> 02:15:42.030
<v Speaker 3>it's very long lasting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It causes dramatic pupil dilation.</v>

2717
02:15:42.060 --> 02:15:47.060
<v Speaker 3>It's extremely nauseated and bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I made an episode about pod in the most </v>

2718
02:15:47.060 --> 02:15:49.410
<v Speaker 3>recent season of my show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2719
02:15:49.800 --> 02:15:54.070
<v Speaker 3>and I vomited so much that my nose </v>
<v Speaker 3>started bleeding.</v>

2720
02:15:54.360 --> 02:15:55.090
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2721
02:15:55.091 --> 02:16:00.091
<v Speaker 3>it was some serious vomiting and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>physically very,</v>

2722
02:16:00.221 --> 02:16:05.221
<v Speaker 3>very punishing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more so than almost anything I've ever </v>

2723
02:16:05.221 --> 02:16:07.651
<v Speaker 3>done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would in terms of the aftereffects or </v>

2724
02:16:07.651 --> 02:16:07.651
<v Speaker 3>while you're doing it while you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2725
02:16:07.651 --> 02:16:11.010
<v Speaker 3>it's a heavy load on the body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's.</v>

2726
02:16:12.140 --> 02:16:14.240
<v Speaker 3>People always say this is not </v>
<v Speaker 3>recreational or whatever,</v>

2727
02:16:14.241 --> 02:16:15.320
<v Speaker 3>but it's truly as NC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2728
02:16:15.321 --> 02:16:16.530
<v Speaker 3>this is really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2729
02:16:16.880 --> 02:16:19.340
<v Speaker 3>a punishing experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And on top of that,</v>

2730
02:16:19.520 --> 02:16:24.520
<v Speaker 3>the native American ceremonies often </v>
<v Speaker 3>accentuate some of those punishing </v>

2731
02:16:24.861 --> 02:16:27.230
<v Speaker 3>aspects of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like water is conserved.</v>

2732
02:16:27.500 --> 02:16:32.500
<v Speaker 3>You don't get to drink as much water as </v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to emphasize the importance of </v>

2733
02:16:32.500 --> 02:16:34.780
<v Speaker 3>water in Mazda Tech,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Salvia ceremonies,</v>

2734
02:16:34.781 --> 02:16:39.781
<v Speaker 3>there's no water at all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I think is actually increases the </v>

2735
02:16:39.781 --> 02:16:42.781
<v Speaker 3>absorption of the leaf into your mouth </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the natural reaction when you </v>

2736
02:16:42.781 --> 02:16:44.620
<v Speaker 3>eat something disgusting is to wash it </v>
<v Speaker 3>down with water.</v>

2737
02:16:45.280 --> 02:16:50.280
<v Speaker 3>These are little things that people do </v>
<v Speaker 3>impulsively without thinking that are </v>

2738
02:16:50.280 --> 02:16:50.280
<v Speaker 3>going to change the nature of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>

2739
02:16:50.380 --> 02:16:52.480
<v Speaker 3>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you eat this cactus,</v>

2740
02:16:52.510 --> 02:16:56.740
<v Speaker 3>it's incredibly nauseated and bitter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you have maybe a 12 hour,</v>

2741
02:16:56.900 --> 02:17:01.900
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hallucinatory euphoric state that's very</v>

2742
02:17:02.290 --> 02:17:05.200
<v Speaker 3>beautiful and strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you see the cactus raw.</v>

2743
02:17:05.290 --> 02:17:06.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people grind it,</v>

2744
02:17:06.671 --> 02:17:11.671
<v Speaker 3>some people cook it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you could get that shit at home </v>

2745
02:17:11.671 --> 02:17:12.170
<v Speaker 3>depot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can get San Pedro at home depot.</v>

2746
02:17:12.590 --> 02:17:14.470
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no pod is a dumpling cactus.</v>

2747
02:17:14.471 --> 02:17:16.140
<v Speaker 3>It's a very small,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2748
02:17:16.210 --> 02:17:21.210
<v Speaker 3>somewhat spherincel cactus that produces</v>
<v Speaker 3>beautiful white and pink flowers.</v>

2749
02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:27.000
<v Speaker 3>And it's incredibly slow growing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is why the conservation of Pod is </v>

2750
02:17:27.100 --> 02:17:30.800
<v Speaker 3>an even bigger issue in the conservation</v>
<v Speaker 3>of toads pod.</v>

2751
02:17:30.820 --> 02:17:35.820
<v Speaker 3>All these psychedelic plants have major </v>
<v Speaker 3>conservation issues that need to be </v>

2752
02:17:35.820 --> 02:17:38.641
<v Speaker 3>addressed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but pod is arguably the biggest of them </v>

2753
02:17:38.641 --> 02:17:39.520
<v Speaker 3>all because this is a slow growing </v>
<v Speaker 3>plant.</v>

2754
02:17:39.521 --> 02:17:42.100
<v Speaker 3>If you want to learn patience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>grow pot,</v>

2755
02:17:42.101 --> 02:17:43.840
<v Speaker 3>that is how you learn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2756
02:17:43.841 --> 02:17:45.010
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this bottle cap,</v>

2757
02:17:45.011 --> 02:17:47.110
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it takes five years before it's the size</v>

2758
02:17:47.111 --> 02:17:48.670
<v Speaker 3>of a dime if you grow it from seed.</v>

2759
02:17:50.140 --> 02:17:52.810
<v Speaker 3>So when you're eating something that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2760
02:17:53.050 --> 02:17:58.050
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's as big as the room of a coffee </v>

2761
02:17:58.050 --> 02:18:02.020
<v Speaker 3>mug or something like that might be 20,</v>
<v Speaker 3>30 years old Jesus Christ.</v>

2762
02:18:02.021 --> 02:18:04.960
<v Speaker 3>So there's a lot of history in these </v>
<v Speaker 3>plants.</v>

2763
02:18:04.961 --> 02:18:09.961
<v Speaker 3>They call them grandfather pod.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think the reason is that by the </v>

2764
02:18:09.961 --> 02:18:10.570
<v Speaker 3>time that they're ready to be consumed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they often,</v>

2765
02:18:10.571 --> 02:18:15.571
<v Speaker 3>our grandfathers or grandmothers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have produce seeds and have </v>

2766
02:18:15.821 --> 02:18:19.240
<v Speaker 3>offspring and all of this stuff because </v>
<v Speaker 3>it takes that long.</v>

2767
02:18:19.540 --> 02:18:22.000
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so yes,</v>

2768
02:18:22.001 --> 02:18:27.001
<v Speaker 3>it's very slow growing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a sustainable practice the way </v>

2769
02:18:27.431 --> 02:18:32.431
<v Speaker 3>that it's being done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's also even bigger threats to </v>

2770
02:18:32.431 --> 02:18:33.880
<v Speaker 3>the environment in the form of root </v>
<v Speaker 3>plowing,</v>

2771
02:18:33.881 --> 02:18:38.881
<v Speaker 3>all the territory to build walmarts and </v>
<v Speaker 3>subdivisions and different things in </v>

2772
02:18:38.881 --> 02:18:41.230
<v Speaker 3>south Texas because most of that land is</v>
<v Speaker 3>privately owned and um,</v>

2773
02:18:42.190 --> 02:18:47.190
<v Speaker 3>and it's difficult because there's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>belief in the native American church </v>

2774
02:18:47.190 --> 02:18:48.760
<v Speaker 3>that has to be an outdoor natural grown.</v>

2775
02:18:48.760 --> 02:18:53.760
<v Speaker 3>It can't be a greenhouse cultivated </v>
<v Speaker 3>plant the because part of the potency </v>

2776
02:18:53.861 --> 02:18:56.080
<v Speaker 3>and the value is from his interaction </v>
<v Speaker 3>with nature.</v>

2777
02:18:56.230 --> 02:18:59.020
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's if it's sustainably harvested,</v>

2778
02:18:59.021 --> 02:19:01.090
<v Speaker 3>where only the crown of the cactus is </v>
<v Speaker 3>removed,</v>

2779
02:19:01.091 --> 02:19:04.450
<v Speaker 3>but this long carrot like taproot is </v>
<v Speaker 3>left in the soil.</v>

2780
02:19:04.451 --> 02:19:09.451
<v Speaker 3>It can regenerate new heads.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if people don't have proper </v>

2781
02:19:09.451 --> 02:19:12.391
<v Speaker 3>harvesting techniques,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can decimate the population very </v>

2782
02:19:12.391 --> 02:19:15.601
<v Speaker 3>quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially because it's not a very </v>

2783
02:19:15.601 --> 02:19:16.780
<v Speaker 3>potent substance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Requires many of these ultra,</v>

2784
02:19:16.810 --> 02:19:19.390
<v Speaker 3>ultra,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ultra slow growing plants.</v>

2785
02:19:19.960 --> 02:19:24.040
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what is the natural territory of it?</v>

2786
02:19:24.041 --> 02:19:26.410
<v Speaker 3>How wide is the natural territory of </v>
<v Speaker 3>these plants?</v>

2787
02:19:26.740 --> 02:19:30.710
<v Speaker 3>I can't tell you exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not very large.</v>

2788
02:19:30.711 --> 02:19:34.670
<v Speaker 3>So if it got very popular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that'd be a real problem yet it probably</v>

2789
02:19:34.671 --> 02:19:35.540
<v Speaker 3>won't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2790
02:19:35.541 --> 02:19:40.541
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people that care most about it </v>

2791
02:19:40.541 --> 02:19:43.061
<v Speaker 3>outside of the native American church </v>
<v Speaker 3>are interestingly cactus files and </v>

2792
02:19:43.061 --> 02:19:47.111
<v Speaker 3>Thailand and Japan who grow it for </v>
<v Speaker 3>purely aesthetic purposes because it's </v>

2793
02:19:47.111 --> 02:19:47.300
<v Speaker 3>so beautiful.</v>

2794
02:19:47.810 --> 02:19:52.810
<v Speaker 3>They and they would never even consider </v>
<v Speaker 3>it because to them it's this prized </v>

2795
02:19:52.810 --> 02:19:55.991
<v Speaker 3>ornamental plant that produces amazing </v>
<v Speaker 3>fruit and flowers and lives seemingly </v>

2796
02:19:56.361 --> 02:19:58.040
<v Speaker 3>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you take care of it,</v>

2797
02:19:58.041 --> 02:20:00.680
<v Speaker 3>it can just look amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2798
02:20:00.830 --> 02:20:01.670
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>

2799
02:20:02.210 --> 02:20:07.210
<v Speaker 3>there's a huge pod scene in Thailand of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that never would dream of </v>

2800
02:20:07.461 --> 02:20:09.320
<v Speaker 3>consuming it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that just grow it ornamental.</v>

2801
02:20:09.440 --> 02:20:12.380
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now San Pedro Cactus,</v>

2802
02:20:12.381 --> 02:20:14.510
<v Speaker 3>does that have psychoactive properties?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely,</v>

2803
02:20:14.511 --> 02:20:19.511
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And did you have to extract it in a </v>

2804
02:20:19.511 --> 02:20:19.511
<v Speaker 3>different way?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2805
02:20:19.511 --> 02:20:20.510
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can be consumed raw.</v>

2806
02:20:20.720 --> 02:20:21.710
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2807
02:20:21.740 --> 02:20:26.740
<v Speaker 3>with some varieties of San Pedro,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they actually contain comparable </v>

2808
02:20:26.740 --> 02:20:30.310
<v Speaker 3>quantities of masculine to pod and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>a much more sustainable source of </v>

2809
02:20:30.310 --> 02:20:31.430
<v Speaker 3>masculine for that reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Crows,</v>

2810
02:20:31.580 --> 02:20:32.810
<v Speaker 3>unlike pod,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it grows very,</v>

2811
02:20:32.811 --> 02:20:37.811
<v Speaker 3>very quickly and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and can be propagated by cutting easily </v>

2812
02:20:37.811 --> 02:20:38.360
<v Speaker 3>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2813
02:20:38.570 --> 02:20:40.740
<v Speaker 3>it's much easier to work with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2814
02:20:41.060 --> 02:20:46.060
<v Speaker 3>but traditionally if you go to Peru,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll take a length of the cactus and </v>

2815
02:20:46.060 --> 02:20:47.450
<v Speaker 3>they'll cut it like a loaf of bread into</v>
<v Speaker 3>slices.</v>

2816
02:20:47.690 --> 02:20:52.690
<v Speaker 3>Then they boil the slices and create a </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of low potency aqueous infusion </v>

2817
02:20:54.380 --> 02:20:59.380
<v Speaker 3>that they drink.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what's interesting about the way </v>

2818
02:20:59.380 --> 02:21:01.961
<v Speaker 3>they do it is that it seems that it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>almost designed to create a lower </v>

2819
02:21:01.961 --> 02:21:02.960
<v Speaker 3>potency drink the way they do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They drink every night,</v>

2820
02:21:03.020 --> 02:21:05.480
<v Speaker 3>the Shamans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every night of their entire life.</v>

2821
02:21:05.720 --> 02:21:08.420
<v Speaker 3>And many people come back and do it </v>
<v Speaker 3>repeatedly.</v>

2822
02:21:08.750 --> 02:21:13.750
<v Speaker 3>And for them it's sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a traditional form of </v>

2823
02:21:13.750 --> 02:21:15.050
<v Speaker 3>microdosing you could say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not about blasting herself into the</v>

2824
02:21:15.051 --> 02:21:16.740
<v Speaker 3>cosmos the way people do when they </v>
<v Speaker 3>smoke.</v>

2825
02:21:16.741 --> 02:21:21.230
<v Speaker 3>DMT.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is about fortifying your body,</v>

2826
02:21:21.231 --> 02:21:23.330
<v Speaker 3>giving yourself strength,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cleansing yourself,</v>

2827
02:21:24.020 --> 02:21:28.370
<v Speaker 3>balancing yourself and other people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>consume it as well.</v>

2828
02:21:29.270 --> 02:21:30.710
<v Speaker 3>Not that I saw there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2829
02:21:31.040 --> 02:21:32.200
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2830
02:21:32.201 --> 02:21:34.370
<v Speaker 3>but people do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What people do I have.</v>

2831
02:21:34.580 --> 02:21:38.480
<v Speaker 3>And what is the effect?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it comparable to the pod effect?</v>

2832
02:21:39.510 --> 02:21:41.450
<v Speaker 3>It's comparable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

2833
02:21:42.470 --> 02:21:43.490
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's comparable,</v>

2834
02:21:43.580 --> 02:21:48.580
<v Speaker 3>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it gets very hard because of these </v>

2835
02:21:48.580 --> 02:21:50.890
<v Speaker 3>variations with natural products in </v>
<v Speaker 3>terms of the potency of the cactus and </v>

2836
02:21:50.890 --> 02:21:54.821
<v Speaker 3>that point in your life and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people will always come up to me and </v>

2837
02:21:54.821 --> 02:21:54.821
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the deal with Mtma?</v>

2838
02:21:54.821 --> 02:21:57.560
<v Speaker 3>It used to be like this and now it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like this.</v>

2839
02:21:57.561 --> 02:21:59.180
<v Speaker 3>What accounts for that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>

2840
02:21:59.181 --> 02:22:04.181
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't underestimate your own changes </v>

2841
02:22:04.181 --> 02:22:04.181
<v Speaker 3>over time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I was 21,</v>

2842
02:22:04.181 --> 02:22:06.500
<v Speaker 3>I could drink alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not that I did very often,</v>

2843
02:22:06.501 --> 02:22:09.080
<v Speaker 3>but I could and not want to kill myself </v>
<v Speaker 3>the next day.</v>

2844
02:22:09.290 --> 02:22:11.960
<v Speaker 3>Now if I try to drink more than three </v>
<v Speaker 3>drinks,</v>

2845
02:22:11.961 --> 02:22:16.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to feel horrible the next day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like just emotionally ruined.</v>

2846
02:22:16.220 --> 02:22:17.750
<v Speaker 3>And that's me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not alcohol.</v>

2847
02:22:18.380 --> 02:22:23.380
<v Speaker 3>Now you brought up the term a hypnotic </v>
<v Speaker 3>and which made me reminded,</v>

2848
02:22:26.640 --> 02:22:30.570
<v Speaker 2>reminded me of our conversation that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>had through email about Roseanne Barr.</v>

2849
02:22:30.750 --> 02:22:32.540
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes,</v>

2850
02:22:32.550 --> 02:22:33.720
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2851
02:22:33.780 --> 02:22:36.630
<v Speaker 2>And about Ambien and about the effects </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Ambien.</v>

2852
02:22:36.660 --> 02:22:38.790
<v Speaker 2>She came on the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She still hasn't.</v>

2853
02:22:39.390 --> 02:22:44.390
<v Speaker 2>She can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's having a really hard time with </v>

2854
02:22:44.390 --> 02:22:44.580
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2855
02:22:45.360 --> 02:22:50.360
<v Speaker 2>she feels terrible about what she said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She feels like the whole world hates </v>

2856
02:22:50.360 --> 02:22:54.150
<v Speaker 2>her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She feels like she's lost everything and</v>

2857
02:22:54.151 --> 02:22:58.150
<v Speaker 2>her life is destroyed and she's </v>
<v Speaker 2>distraught and she,</v>

2858
02:22:58.310 --> 02:23:02.560
<v Speaker 2>she was going to fly out here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we had a conversation and we kind of</v>

2859
02:23:02.561 --> 02:23:05.140
<v Speaker 2>decided to be probably better if she </v>
<v Speaker 2>waited,</v>

2860
02:23:05.590 --> 02:23:07.150
<v Speaker 2>just let,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let some of this</v>

2861
02:23:07.900 --> 02:23:12.900
<v Speaker 2>pass by.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's still in the news because they've </v>

2862
02:23:12.900 --> 02:23:13.410
<v Speaker 2>decided to move the show on without her </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

2863
02:23:13.411 --> 02:23:15.070
<v Speaker 2>They're going to kill her off or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

2864
02:23:15.940 --> 02:23:19.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she's just devastated and uh,</v>

2865
02:23:20.160 --> 02:23:23.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was also devastated health wise.</v>

2866
02:23:23.740 --> 02:23:28.740
<v Speaker 2>Physically she's an older woman and not </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it'd be any different.</v>

2867
02:23:28.870 --> 02:23:33.870
<v Speaker 2>She was an older man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's an older person and this grueling </v>

2868
02:23:33.870 --> 02:23:35.100
<v Speaker 2>schedule of doing a television show was </v>
<v Speaker 2>horrible on her.</v>

2869
02:23:35.101 --> 02:23:36.870
<v Speaker 2>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was really,</v>

2870
02:23:36.930 --> 02:23:39.780
<v Speaker 2>really tough to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She got bronchitis.</v>

2871
02:23:39.781 --> 02:23:44.781
<v Speaker 2>She felt like she was almost dying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was completely exhausted and she </v>

2872
02:23:44.781 --> 02:23:49.611
<v Speaker 2>felt like the schedule of it all just </v>
<v Speaker 2>was just way too taxing on her </v>

2873
02:23:49.611 --> 02:23:51.310
<v Speaker 2>physically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then on top of that,</v>

2874
02:23:51.311 --> 02:23:54.670
<v Speaker 2>she's on a host of different things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's,</v>

2875
02:23:54.700 --> 02:23:59.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she'll ever do wind up sitting down and </v>

2876
02:23:59.700 --> 02:23:59.700
<v Speaker 2>talking on the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll get her to,</v>

2877
02:23:59.700 --> 02:24:03.640
<v Speaker 2>to list the various thing she's on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she's on various antidepressants.</v>

2878
02:24:03.810 --> 02:24:05.590
<v Speaker 2>She changes them up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mixes them mob.</v>

2879
02:24:05.591 --> 02:24:07.000
<v Speaker 2>She was one of the things she said to </v>
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>

2880
02:24:07.020 --> 02:24:09.460
<v Speaker 2>she's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she needs to get her doses readjusted.</v>

2881
02:24:09.820 --> 02:24:13.390
<v Speaker 2>She drinks alcohol regularly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she smokes marijuana regularly.</v>

2882
02:24:13.540 --> 02:24:18.540
<v Speaker 2>She's also an Ambien,</v>
<v Speaker 2>regularly takes it every night to go to </v>

2883
02:24:18.540 --> 02:24:21.391
<v Speaker 2>sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I tried to explain to her the fact </v>

2884
02:24:21.391 --> 02:24:24.340
<v Speaker 2>that you're not getting real sleep when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're on that this is not something you</v>

2885
02:24:24.341 --> 02:24:26.560
<v Speaker 2>should take and rely on on a daily </v>
<v Speaker 2>basis.</v>

2886
02:24:26.561 --> 02:24:28.990
<v Speaker 2>They even tell you to get off of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2887
02:24:28.991 --> 02:24:29.510
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2888
02:24:29.540 --> 02:24:32.740
<v Speaker 2>and it's difficult to get off of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2889
02:24:32.860 --> 02:24:37.860
<v Speaker 2>but people want to dismiss the idea that</v>
<v Speaker 2>she could have said something that's </v>

2890
02:24:39.871 --> 02:24:44.871
<v Speaker 2>completely out of character or done </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that's completely out of </v>

2891
02:24:44.871 --> 02:24:47.571
<v Speaker 2>character while under the influence of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this stuff that it could have </v>

2892
02:24:47.571 --> 02:24:50.871
<v Speaker 2>contributed to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to dismiss it because they </v>

2893
02:24:50.871 --> 02:24:50.871
<v Speaker 2>want a villain they want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>

2894
02:24:50.871 --> 02:24:51.960
<v Speaker 2>she's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want this,</v>

2895
02:24:51.961 --> 02:24:56.961
<v Speaker 2>like this childlike simplistic reasoning</v>
<v Speaker 2>and rationalization.</v>

2896
02:24:58.691 --> 02:24:59.470
<v Speaker 2>For what she's done,</v>

2897
02:25:00.290 --> 02:25:01.400
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is,</v>

2898
02:25:01.401 --> 02:25:06.401
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>prime example of this sort of </v>

2899
02:25:06.401 --> 02:25:08.520
<v Speaker 3>schizophrenia nature of the way drugs </v>
<v Speaker 3>are depicted in our society.</v>

2900
02:25:08.760 --> 02:25:13.760
<v Speaker 3>If it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it's something like bath salts or k </v>

2901
02:25:13.760 --> 02:25:16.680
<v Speaker 3>two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're responsible for everything.</v>

2902
02:25:16.681 --> 02:25:21.570
<v Speaker 3>One toke of that stuff and you're eating</v>
<v Speaker 3>your best friend's face under a bridge,</v>

2903
02:25:22.120 --> 02:25:26.590
<v Speaker 3>but then in case they have no </v>
<v Speaker 3>explanation whatsoever,</v>

2904
02:25:26.591 --> 02:25:30.540
<v Speaker 3>no exculpatory value,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can't be used to explain anything.</v>

2905
02:25:30.610 --> 02:25:31.810
<v Speaker 3>Is it an excuse?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2906
02:25:31.811 --> 02:25:34.270
<v Speaker 3>Is it an explanation?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think yes.</v>

2907
02:25:34.960 --> 02:25:39.960
<v Speaker 3>I think that intoxication can explain </v>
<v Speaker 3>all sorts of inappropriate behavior and </v>

2908
02:25:39.960 --> 02:25:42.400
<v Speaker 3>to pretend otherwise is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

2909
02:25:42.401 --> 02:25:47.401
<v Speaker 3>dishonest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know am Sanofi the pharmaceutical </v>

2910
02:25:47.401 --> 02:25:50.581
<v Speaker 3>company that manufactures ambien had </v>
<v Speaker 3>this widely shared tweet saying that </v>

2911
02:25:50.581 --> 02:25:54.781
<v Speaker 3>racism isn't a side effect of Ambien,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a little bit ridiculous for </v>

2912
02:25:54.781 --> 02:25:56.460
<v Speaker 3>them to have done that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2913
02:25:56.461 --> 02:25:59.260
<v Speaker 3>especially to someone who's mentally ill</v>
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>

2914
02:25:59.380 --> 02:26:01.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look at the medical literature,</v>

2915
02:26:01.181 --> 02:26:06.181
<v Speaker 3>the fact of the matter is that ambient </v>
<v Speaker 3>is associated with all sorts of absurd </v>

2916
02:26:06.181 --> 02:26:06.430
<v Speaker 3>behaviors.</v>

2917
02:26:06.670 --> 02:26:10.000
<v Speaker 3>Command hallucinations where people stab</v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves,</v>

2918
02:26:10.060 --> 02:26:12.490
<v Speaker 3>jump out windows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that you know,</v>

2919
02:26:12.550 --> 02:26:17.550
<v Speaker 3>butter their cigarettes and smoke them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People that paint their houses in the </v>

2920
02:26:17.740 --> 02:26:19.150
<v Speaker 3>middle of the night with no memory </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatsoever,</v>

2921
02:26:19.151 --> 02:26:22.420
<v Speaker 3>and it's a profoundly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>profoundly disinhibiting drug.</v>

2922
02:26:22.540 --> 02:26:23.680
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2923
02:26:24.010 --> 02:26:29.010
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's maybe a somewhat analogous </v>

2924
02:26:29.010 --> 02:26:30.841
<v Speaker 3>example from my own life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never take ambien on planes for this </v>

2925
02:26:30.841 --> 02:26:33.541
<v Speaker 3>reason because I'm around strangers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what I'm going to say or </v>

2926
02:26:33.541 --> 02:26:34.450
<v Speaker 3>what I'm going to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let alone use twitter,</v>

2927
02:26:34.630 --> 02:26:39.630
<v Speaker 3>but I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's uncomfortable because it's so </v>

2928
02:26:39.630 --> 02:26:39.630
<v Speaker 3>disinhibiting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might do something weird.</v>

2929
02:26:39.630 --> 02:26:40.000
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take off my shirt.</v>

2930
02:26:40.001 --> 02:26:45.001
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You who's to predict what you're going </v>

2931
02:26:45.001 --> 02:26:45.010
<v Speaker 3>to do when you have no inhibitions </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatsoever.</v>

2932
02:26:45.250 --> 02:26:49.620
<v Speaker 3>So I remember once I was on the plane to</v>
<v Speaker 3>Berlin and I did take ambien and I start</v>

2933
02:26:49.670 --> 02:26:54.670
<v Speaker 3>in this sort of delusional state </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking that the cabin crew and the </v>

2934
02:26:54.910 --> 02:26:59.470
<v Speaker 3>person that's announcing over the </v>
<v Speaker 3>entercom is saying various Nazi things.</v>

2935
02:26:59.590 --> 02:27:04.570
<v Speaker 3>That's like an unfair stereotype that </v>
<v Speaker 3>all Germans are Nazis that's offensive,</v>

2936
02:27:04.750 --> 02:27:09.750
<v Speaker 3>but I had no control over this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just because they're German talking in </v>

2937
02:27:09.750 --> 02:27:14.041
<v Speaker 3>German doesn't mean that this is like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>Nazi airship because you're just </v>

2938
02:27:14.041 --> 02:27:15.820
<v Speaker 3>completely out of your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2939
02:27:16.030 --> 02:27:17.120
<v Speaker 3>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2940
02:27:17.450 --> 02:27:19.120
<v Speaker 3>like another story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2941
02:27:19.660 --> 02:27:22.510
<v Speaker 3>I used to be friends with a girl whose </v>
<v Speaker 3>dad was a psychiatrist,</v>

2942
02:27:22.511 --> 02:27:25.620
<v Speaker 3>prescribes her immense quantities of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Ambien and um,</v>

2943
02:27:25.720 --> 02:27:27.870
<v Speaker 3>she would snort it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no reason to start it.</v>

2944
02:27:27.871 --> 02:27:30.160
<v Speaker 3>It's water soluble.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has a fast onset of action.</v>

2945
02:27:30.161 --> 02:27:32.740
<v Speaker 3>There's no benefit and snorting it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fine orally if you're going to take</v>

2946
02:27:32.741 --> 02:27:37.741
<v Speaker 3>it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's no reason to take high </v>

2947
02:27:37.741 --> 02:27:38.911
<v Speaker 3>doses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's already a delirium at the </v>

2948
02:27:38.911 --> 02:27:38.911
<v Speaker 3>therapeutic dose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't need to take more,</v>

2949
02:27:38.911 --> 02:27:40.570
<v Speaker 3>even five milligrams induces delirium.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

2950
02:27:40.840 --> 02:27:45.840
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I remember I was at some party and </v>

2951
02:27:46.631 --> 02:27:49.610
<v Speaker 3>someone was saying that they wanted </v>
<v Speaker 3>ketamine,</v>

2952
02:27:49.630 --> 02:27:53.260
<v Speaker 3>did anyone at the party of ketamine and </v>
<v Speaker 3>just a complete stranger.</v>

2953
02:27:53.350 --> 02:27:54.070
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2954
02:27:54.071 --> 02:27:56.530
<v Speaker 3>I actually have a little bit of ketamine</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's at my apartment,</v>

2955
02:27:56.680 --> 02:28:00.630
<v Speaker 3>here are the keys and here's my address </v>
<v Speaker 3>and just run over to my apartment and,</v>

2956
02:28:00.830 --> 02:28:03.550
<v Speaker 3>and help yourself talk to you later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2957
02:28:03.760 --> 02:28:05.500
<v Speaker 3>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2958
02:28:05.850 --> 02:28:06.880
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm one of these people,</v>

2959
02:28:06.881 --> 02:28:09.040
<v Speaker 3>I've never lost my phone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>never lost my keys.</v>

2960
02:28:09.041 --> 02:28:10.630
<v Speaker 3>I don't lose things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then I,</v>

2961
02:28:10.631 --> 02:28:11.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wake up the next morning,</v>

2962
02:28:12.020 --> 02:28:13.510
<v Speaker 3>go to my apartment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>reached into my pocket,</v>

2963
02:28:13.511 --> 02:28:16.450
<v Speaker 3>my keys are gone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then it hits me this flash of,</v>

2964
02:28:16.630 --> 02:28:21.630
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I gave my keys away to a complete </v>

2965
02:28:21.630 --> 02:28:23.150
<v Speaker 3>stranger to go to my apartment and take </v>
<v Speaker 3>ketamine from me.</v>

2966
02:28:23.600 --> 02:28:27.320
<v Speaker 3>What on earth was I thinking?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

2967
02:28:27.330 --> 02:28:31.540
<v Speaker 3>Like what level of disinhibition is </v>
<v Speaker 3>required to do something that insane.</v>

2968
02:28:31.810 --> 02:28:36.810
<v Speaker 3>Luckily I was there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had to spend the rest of the day </v>

2969
02:28:36.810 --> 02:28:38.521
<v Speaker 3>tracing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>finding out who that person was getting </v>

2970
02:28:38.521 --> 02:28:40.471
<v Speaker 3>my keys and these people happen to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>very courteous people and actually did </v>

2971
02:28:40.471 --> 02:28:44.031
<v Speaker 3>go to my apartment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did take the small amount of ketamine </v>

2972
02:28:44.031 --> 02:28:46.260
<v Speaker 3>that I had and then just lock the door </v>
<v Speaker 3>after themselves and didn't make a mess.</v>

2973
02:28:47.910 --> 02:28:49.140
<v Speaker 3>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is like,</v>

2974
02:28:49.650 --> 02:28:53.130
<v Speaker 3>this is a profoundly disinhibiting </v>
<v Speaker 3>substance.</v>

2975
02:28:53.131 --> 02:28:58.131
<v Speaker 3>And also I think the idea that a drug </v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't modulate racist activities.</v>

2976
02:28:58.430 --> 02:29:03.430
<v Speaker 3>Interesting as well because there's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>study that you can look up where they </v>

2977
02:29:03.430 --> 02:29:06.641
<v Speaker 3>use the Beta blocker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>propranolol and they found that it </v>

2978
02:29:06.641 --> 02:29:10.151
<v Speaker 3>actually seems to block racial implicit </v>
<v Speaker 3>racial bias in people in certain tests </v>

2979
02:29:12.210 --> 02:29:14.630
<v Speaker 3>that what they're suggesting is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's an address,</v>

2980
02:29:14.631 --> 02:29:18.410
<v Speaker 3>energetic component to implicit racial </v>
<v Speaker 3>bias,</v>

2981
02:29:18.411 --> 02:29:23.411
<v Speaker 3>but there's a certain maybe heart rate </v>
<v Speaker 3>or fear response and once the </v>

2982
02:29:23.411 --> 02:29:27.280
<v Speaker 3>physiologically blocked you become less </v>
<v Speaker 3>racist in a sense implicitly.</v>

2983
02:29:28.030 --> 02:29:31.120
<v Speaker 3>It's not a conscious decision.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Conscious racism isn't reduced,</v>

2984
02:29:31.121 --> 02:29:35.770
<v Speaker 3>but an implicit racial bias is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean these are like really complicated</v>

2985
02:29:35.950 --> 02:29:40.950
<v Speaker 3>higher level questions about how drugs </v>
<v Speaker 3>impact cognitive functioning and um,</v>

2986
02:29:42.500 --> 02:29:47.500
<v Speaker 3>and the bottom line I think is be </v>
<v Speaker 3>careful being certain about anything </v>

2987
02:29:47.500 --> 02:29:48.980
<v Speaker 3>about what drugs can or can't do.</v>

2988
02:29:50.170 --> 02:29:51.790
<v Speaker 4>What does this Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2989
02:29:51.800 --> 02:29:56.050
<v Speaker 4>this is the story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Blood pressure drug reduces inbuilt.</v>

2990
02:29:56.140 --> 02:29:58.780
<v Speaker 4>What does that word in built?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Racism.</v>

2991
02:29:59.820 --> 02:30:04.020
<v Speaker 4>Common heart disease drug may have an </v>
<v Speaker 4>unusual side effect of combating racism.</v>

2992
02:30:04.560 --> 02:30:09.560
<v Speaker 4>Wasn't that a fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was that stupid movie with Jack </v>

2993
02:30:09.560 --> 02:30:11.670
<v Speaker 4>Nicholson and Helen Hunt is good as it </v>
<v Speaker 4>gets.</v>

2994
02:30:12.360 --> 02:30:15.360
<v Speaker 4>He was a racist and they gave him a </v>
<v Speaker 4>pill.</v>

2995
02:30:15.570 --> 02:30:18.180
<v Speaker 4>They gave him some medication and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>reduced racism.</v>

2996
02:30:18.181 --> 02:30:20.400
<v Speaker 4>It stopped him from being racist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>

2997
02:30:20.401 --> 02:30:25.401
<v Speaker 4>I completely forgot about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember it because I was angry </v>

2998
02:30:25.401 --> 02:30:28.520
<v Speaker 4>because a bunch of people from the the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was working on television show at the </v>

2999
02:30:28.520 --> 02:30:29.220
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A bunch of people were talking about how</v>

3000
02:30:29.221 --> 02:30:34.221
<v Speaker 4>great a movie it was because it was this</v>
<v Speaker 4>weird dark sort of film and I was like,</v>

3001
02:30:34.651 --> 02:30:36.990
<v Speaker 4>that movie fucking sucked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was so depressing.</v>

3002
02:30:37.290 --> 02:30:38.250
<v Speaker 4>Here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This woman,</v>

3003
02:30:38.460 --> 02:30:43.460
<v Speaker 4>she's got a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's a waitress and Jack Nicholson is </v>

3004
02:30:43.460 --> 02:30:47.691
<v Speaker 4>this old racist asshole and she's </v>
<v Speaker 4>relying on him for some real reason </v>

3005
02:30:47.691 --> 02:30:51.030
<v Speaker 4>because you can't find anyone who's nice</v>
<v Speaker 4>to her and and he's racist,</v>

3006
02:30:51.031 --> 02:30:51.650
<v Speaker 4>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3007
02:30:52.210 --> 02:30:57.210
<v Speaker 4>the resolve of the film was that he just</v>
<v Speaker 4>was sick and they gave him some </v>

3008
02:30:57.210 --> 02:30:57.660
<v Speaker 4>medication.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He wasn't racing anymore.</v>

3009
02:30:57.661 --> 02:30:58.830
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get the fuck out of here.</v>

3010
02:30:58.831 --> 02:31:01.110
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Meanwhile,</v>

3011
02:31:01.120 --> 02:31:01.690
<v Speaker 4>maybe it does.</v>

3012
02:31:02.500 --> 02:31:04.550
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ambient is an amazing,</v>

3013
02:31:04.610 --> 02:31:09.610
<v Speaker 3>amazing substance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I made a piece about it called the </v>

3014
02:31:09.610 --> 02:31:09.610
<v Speaker 3>ambient effect years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you're familiar.</v>

3015
02:31:09.610 --> 02:31:12.770
<v Speaker 3>They're people who are paralyzed who can</v>
<v Speaker 3>take ambien and start walking again.</v>

3016
02:31:12.771 --> 02:31:17.771
<v Speaker 3>It has the power to regenerate regions </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the to regenerate activity in regions</v>

3017
02:31:17.871 --> 02:31:19.970
<v Speaker 3>of the brain that looked dead on Fmr.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Try</v>

3018
02:31:20.200 --> 02:31:25.200
<v Speaker 1>it is a wacky drug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also chemically very similar to </v>

3019
02:31:25.200 --> 02:31:26.010
<v Speaker 1>five methyl dmt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

3020
02:31:26.030 --> 02:31:31.030
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like a benzodiazepine like </v>

3021
02:31:31.030 --> 02:31:31.170
<v Speaker 1>valium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has its own bizarre structure.</v>

3022
02:31:31.171 --> 02:31:32.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird drug.</v>

3023
02:31:33.450 --> 02:31:37.230
<v Speaker 1>So when these people are paralyzed by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the paralyzed,</v>

3024
02:31:37.231 --> 02:31:39.030
<v Speaker 1>like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is wrong with the strokes?</v>

3025
02:31:39.060 --> 02:31:41.250
<v Speaker 1>Traumatic brain injury,</v>
<v Speaker 1>various reasons.</v>

3026
02:31:41.251 --> 02:31:44.490
<v Speaker 1>There's a book about it called hope and </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain damage.</v>

3027
02:31:44.491 --> 02:31:49.491
<v Speaker 1>I believe the title of it is an Ambien </v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow or another temporarily fixes it.</v>

3028
02:31:50.580 --> 02:31:52.650
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Temper only for the duration of the drug</v>

3029
02:31:52.651 --> 02:31:56.220
<v Speaker 1>effects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those people that are in a persistent</v>

3030
02:31:56.221 --> 02:32:01.221
<v Speaker 1>vegetative state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they take ambien and suddenly they wake </v>

3031
02:32:01.221 --> 02:32:01.230
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck?</v>

3032
02:32:01.231 --> 02:32:02.070
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3033
02:32:02.100 --> 02:32:07.100
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's well documented and it's a really </v>

3034
02:32:07.100 --> 02:32:10.520
<v Speaker 1>bizarre effect that is exclusively </v>
<v Speaker 1>present in ambient and maybe slightly </v>

3035
02:32:10.671 --> 02:32:12.510
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Baclifin as well.</v>

3036
02:32:12.530 --> 02:32:17.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that the statement that the </v>

3037
02:32:17.530 --> 02:32:20.031
<v Speaker 1>pharmaceutical company made about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>racism not being a side effect was kind </v>

3038
02:32:20.571 --> 02:32:21.090
<v Speaker 1>of cute.</v>

3039
02:32:21.210 --> 02:32:24.090
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of witty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a very snarky.</v>

3040
02:32:24.150 --> 02:32:26.730
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the problem with that shit is,</v>

3041
02:32:26.731 --> 02:32:28.860
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the side effects?</v>

3042
02:32:28.861 --> 02:32:30.750
<v Speaker 1>And then you go into the actual side </v>
<v Speaker 1>effects and like,</v>

3043
02:32:30.751 --> 02:32:33.120
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is this legal?</v>

3044
02:32:33.240 --> 02:32:34.560
<v Speaker 1>And then you go into the side effects of</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3045
02:32:34.740 --> 02:32:38.040
<v Speaker 1>what is this doing to people like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well here's another one.</v>

3046
02:32:38.070 --> 02:32:41.670
<v Speaker 1>It supposedly increases consolidation of</v>
<v Speaker 1>negative memories.</v>

3047
02:32:42.330 --> 02:32:43.280
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3048
02:32:43.350 --> 02:32:46.440
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of weird stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Negative memory increases.</v>

3049
02:32:46.441 --> 02:32:51.441
<v Speaker 1>Consolidation of negative memories </v>
<v Speaker 1>causes a just total hallucinatory </v>

3050
02:32:51.441 --> 02:32:55.490
<v Speaker 1>insanity at higher doses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the most powerful disinhibiting </v>

3051
02:32:55.490 --> 02:32:59.391
<v Speaker 1>agent I'm aware of and is able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>restore cognitive and motor functioning </v>

3052
02:33:00.541 --> 02:33:02.160
<v Speaker 1>and people with traumatic brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>injuries.</v>

3053
02:33:02.161 --> 02:33:05.280
<v Speaker 1>What a weird drug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very weird.</v>

3054
02:33:05.640 --> 02:33:10.050
<v Speaker 1>And not not something people should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking every day.</v>

3055
02:33:10.080 --> 02:33:12.570
<v Speaker 1>Just not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly addictive.</v>

3056
02:33:12.571 --> 02:33:17.571
<v Speaker 1>I mean it binds to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though it's not a benzodiazepine </v>

3057
02:33:17.571 --> 02:33:19.791
<v Speaker 1>itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it binds to the benzodiazepine site on </v>

3058
02:33:19.791 --> 02:33:19.791
<v Speaker 1>the Gaba a receptor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yes,</v>

3059
02:33:19.791 --> 02:33:20.580
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's addictive.</v>

3060
02:33:20.640 --> 02:33:23.100
<v Speaker 1>It's super addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for that reason alone,</v>

3061
02:33:23.101 --> 02:33:28.101
<v Speaker 1>people shouldn't be taking it every day </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you'll become horrendously </v>

3062
02:33:28.101 --> 02:33:29.460
<v Speaker 1>dependent on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And withdrawal is ruthless.</v>

3063
02:33:29.590 --> 02:33:32.730
<v Speaker 1>The etsy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the withdrawal is total insomnia.</v>

3064
02:33:36.270 --> 02:33:39.390
<v Speaker 1>So most people just go right back to it </v>
<v Speaker 1>or you know,</v>

3065
02:33:39.391 --> 02:33:44.391
<v Speaker 1>you can then track,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you can transition onto different </v>

3066
02:33:44.391 --> 02:33:44.391
<v Speaker 1>types of hypnotics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like taking an anticholinergic,</v>

3067
02:33:44.391 --> 02:33:48.270
<v Speaker 1>like Benadryl to sleep or cannabinoids </v>
<v Speaker 1>cannabis,</v>

3068
02:33:48.271 --> 02:33:50.120
<v Speaker 1>things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or um,</v>

3069
02:33:50.160 --> 02:33:51.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just things that don't buy into the Gaba</v>

3070
02:33:51.961 --> 02:33:54.600
<v Speaker 1>a receptor in order to try to reduce </v>
<v Speaker 1>tolerance.</v>

3071
02:33:54.660 --> 02:33:59.660
<v Speaker 1>There's ways around it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not doomed if you start taking </v>

3072
02:33:59.660 --> 02:33:59.660
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

3073
02:33:59.660 --> 02:33:59.910
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3074
02:34:00.090 --> 02:34:05.090
<v Speaker 1>habit forming and something that's best </v>
<v Speaker 1>to avoid if you don't require it and it </v>

3075
02:34:05.090 --> 02:34:06.270
<v Speaker 1>doesn't give you real sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

3076
02:34:06.271 --> 02:34:06.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

3077
02:34:06.960 --> 02:34:10.890
<v Speaker 1>you're missing some part of the sleep </v>
<v Speaker 1>cycle with Dr Matthew Walker was on,</v>

3078
02:34:10.891 --> 02:34:13.980
<v Speaker 1>here's a sleep specialist and he went </v>
<v Speaker 1>into depth about it,</v>

3079
02:34:13.981 --> 02:34:17.010
<v Speaker 1>but I really don't remember his exact </v>
<v Speaker 1>description,</v>

3080
02:34:17.320 --> 02:34:21.040
<v Speaker 1>but he was talking about how it bypasses</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain cycles and you're,</v>

3081
02:34:21.041 --> 02:34:23.290
<v Speaker 1>you're not getting a real night's sleep.</v>

3082
02:34:23.930 --> 02:34:26.100
<v Speaker 1>I am not aware of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3083
02:34:26.230 --> 02:34:28.960
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't surprise me hugely.</v>

3084
02:34:28.961 --> 02:34:31.420
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's still debate about what the most</v>

3085
02:34:31.421 --> 02:34:34.030
<v Speaker 1>restful part of sleep is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3086
02:34:34.420 --> 02:34:38.740
<v Speaker 1>I think most literature points to </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually non rem sleep,</v>

3087
02:34:39.370 --> 02:34:42.010
<v Speaker 1>slow wave sleep being the most restful </v>
<v Speaker 1>type.</v>

3088
02:34:42.011 --> 02:34:47.011
<v Speaker 1>And that's actually supported or </v>
<v Speaker 1>promoted by chemicals like Musk Amal </v>

3089
02:34:47.011 --> 02:34:48.850
<v Speaker 1>from the m and e to miscarry a mushroom </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

3090
02:34:48.910 --> 02:34:53.910
<v Speaker 1>that in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there was one pharmaceutical </v>

3091
02:34:53.910 --> 02:34:56.281
<v Speaker 1>derivative called gearbox at all that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>did an episode about on the most recent </v>

3092
02:34:56.281 --> 02:35:00.750
<v Speaker 1>season of my show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that really does produce incredibly </v>

3093
02:35:00.750 --> 02:35:01.110
<v Speaker 1>restful sleep that is superior to </v>
<v Speaker 1>ambient.</v>

3094
02:35:01.111 --> 02:35:03.040
<v Speaker 1>But like ambient,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was also psychedelic,</v>

3095
02:35:03.041 --> 02:35:06.790
<v Speaker 1>even more psychedelic probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is an issue.</v>

3096
02:35:06.791 --> 02:35:09.820
<v Speaker 1>It seems it for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of these drugs that really promote</v>

3097
02:35:10.450 --> 02:35:15.450
<v Speaker 1>sleep effectively also happened to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>hallucinogenic and nobody knows exactly </v>

3098
02:35:15.491 --> 02:35:20.491
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's been a pharmaceutical barrier </v>

3099
02:35:20.491 --> 02:35:23.890
<v Speaker 1>because we don't live in a culture that </v>
<v Speaker 1>allows people to go nuts at night.</v>

3100
02:35:25.510 --> 02:35:26.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no kidding.</v>

3101
02:35:27.610 --> 02:35:31.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad you brought up the mud to </v>
<v Speaker 1>miscarrying because that's another one.</v>

3102
02:35:31.870 --> 02:35:33.490
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is,</v>

3103
02:35:33.491 --> 02:35:38.491
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost like a drug of lore more than a </v>

3104
02:35:39.730 --> 02:35:44.730
<v Speaker 1>drug of application.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't really hear too much about </v>

3105
02:35:44.730 --> 02:35:46.300
<v Speaker 1>people getting real good experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No you don't.</v>

3106
02:35:46.750 --> 02:35:51.430
<v Speaker 1>But it's also connected to a sacred </v>
<v Speaker 1>mushroom and the cross,</v>

3107
02:35:51.431 --> 02:35:56.431
<v Speaker 1>the cover of it from John,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mark or allegro has an emmy nominated </v>

3108
02:35:56.431 --> 02:35:59.311
<v Speaker 1>Mascara.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thought that the emanated Ms Dot </v>

3109
02:35:59.311 --> 02:36:02.400
<v Speaker 1>Garcia was probably linked to </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic states and pre historic </v>

3110
02:36:02.400 --> 02:36:03.810
<v Speaker 1>Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

3111
02:36:04.110 --> 02:36:05.020
<v Speaker 1>we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3112
02:36:05.200 --> 02:36:07.630
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's such a salacious wacky guy.</v>

3113
02:36:07.660 --> 02:36:09.910
<v Speaker 1>Mazy oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

3114
02:36:10.300 --> 02:36:10.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

3115
02:36:10.841 --> 02:36:13.210
<v Speaker 1>he was getting off on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He loved it.</v>

3116
02:36:13.330 --> 02:36:16.090
<v Speaker 1>He will love getting off on freaking </v>
<v Speaker 1>people out.</v>

3117
02:36:16.240 --> 02:36:17.500
<v Speaker 1>Freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christian.</v>

3118
02:36:17.830 --> 02:36:22.830
<v Speaker 1>That was a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't underestimate what he was </v>

3119
02:36:22.830 --> 02:36:25.141
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was saying all of Christianity is a </v>

3120
02:36:25.141 --> 02:36:27.841
<v Speaker 1>sex cult that worships a fungal Phallus </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the semen of that Phallus or the </v>

3121
02:36:28.361 --> 02:36:29.200
<v Speaker 1>spores.</v>

3122
02:36:29.320 --> 02:36:34.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then all of Christianity is an ancient </v>

3123
02:36:34.320 --> 02:36:35.980
<v Speaker 1>fertility called.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a big claim from a serious Oxford</v>

3124
02:36:35.981 --> 02:36:40.450
<v Speaker 1>educated Dead Sea scrolls scholar who is</v>
<v Speaker 1>respected up until that point.</v>

3125
02:36:40.900 --> 02:36:42.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who was also an ordained minister.</v>

3126
02:36:43.240 --> 02:36:48.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a great book called </v>

3127
02:36:48.240 --> 02:36:50.791
<v Speaker 1>shroom that argues that this was all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some kind of cynical attack on the </v>

3128
02:36:50.791 --> 02:36:50.791
<v Speaker 1>Christian religion and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3129
02:36:50.791 --> 02:36:52.750
<v Speaker 1>he didn't even believe it himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm.</v>

3130
02:36:53.140 --> 02:36:58.140
<v Speaker 1>The issue is that in order to carefully </v>
<v Speaker 1>examine his claims,</v>

3131
02:36:58.181 --> 02:37:00.700
<v Speaker 1>you need to speak what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ancient Aramaic or something.</v>

3132
02:37:00.970 --> 02:37:02.290
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't,</v>

3133
02:37:02.530 --> 02:37:07.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm not in a position reading his book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is all having to do with the </v>

3134
02:37:07.530 --> 02:37:10.660
<v Speaker 1>etymology of these words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their origins in different languages.</v>

3135
02:37:10.661 --> 02:37:14.650
<v Speaker 1>I just don't know enough about these </v>
<v Speaker 1>ancient languages to make a,</v>

3136
02:37:14.750 --> 02:37:16.370
<v Speaker 1>an informed assessment</v>

3137
02:37:16.370 --> 02:37:18.540
<v Speaker 3>of his claims.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

3138
02:37:18.620 --> 02:37:23.620
<v Speaker 3>which is I think one reason that they've</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of hung around in this lower for </v>

3139
02:37:23.620 --> 02:37:25.490
<v Speaker 3>such a long time because it's hard for </v>
<v Speaker 3>people to say with certainty,</v>

3140
02:37:25.810 --> 02:37:27.440
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they're true or not.</v>

3141
02:37:27.441 --> 02:37:32.090
<v Speaker 3>Although I leaned to them for them </v>
<v Speaker 3>probably not being well supported.</v>

3142
02:37:36.880 --> 02:37:39.160
<v Speaker 4>They pause.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why is that?</v>

3143
02:37:39.230 --> 02:37:41.180
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just seems to be wacky.</v>

3144
02:37:41.210 --> 02:37:41.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because they're not.</v>

3145
02:37:41.931 --> 02:37:46.931
<v Speaker 3>I haven't seen them integrated into any </v>
<v Speaker 3>serious work since I'm not that that's </v>

3146
02:37:47.721 --> 02:37:49.280
<v Speaker 3>necessarily a good argument.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3147
02:37:49.360 --> 02:37:54.360
<v Speaker 4>To take on a lot of education to be able</v>
<v Speaker 4>to even understand whether or not that </v>

3148
02:37:56.030 --> 02:37:57.020
<v Speaker 4>debate is</v>

3149
02:37:57.600 --> 02:37:58.800
<v Speaker 3>cogent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

3150
02:37:59.550 --> 02:38:00.690
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the same deal.</v>

3151
02:38:00.780 --> 02:38:05.780
<v Speaker 3>I encountered this sometimes on really </v>
<v Speaker 3>fringe aspects of physics and chemistry </v>

3152
02:38:05.780 --> 02:38:09.531
<v Speaker 3>where someone will make some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>wacky argument about the way atoms bond </v>

3153
02:38:09.531 --> 02:38:10.140
<v Speaker 3>or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>

3154
02:38:10.650 --> 02:38:15.650
<v Speaker 3>it gets hard because you only have like </v>
<v Speaker 3>a small handful of people that are </v>

3155
02:38:15.650 --> 02:38:16.530
<v Speaker 3>capable of seriously evaluating the </v>
<v Speaker 3>claims,</v>

3156
02:38:16.560 --> 02:38:21.240
<v Speaker 3>able to weigh in and then it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>really get vetted in a serious way.</v>

3157
02:38:21.241 --> 02:38:23.250
<v Speaker 3>So things just linger around is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's true,</v>

3158
02:38:23.251 --> 02:38:25.290
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>

3159
02:38:25.500 --> 02:38:30.500
<v Speaker 3>but the bottom line is that most people </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't get it a valuable experience from </v>

3160
02:38:30.500 --> 02:38:31.230
<v Speaker 3>these mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but some do,</v>

3161
02:38:31.260 --> 02:38:34.140
<v Speaker 3>some people have figured out how to make</v>
<v Speaker 3>it work and the experiences,</v>

3162
02:38:34.141 --> 02:38:34.680
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3163
02:38:34.681 --> 02:38:35.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's its own thing.</v>

3164
02:38:35.761 --> 02:38:40.761
<v Speaker 3>It's a gabaergic delirium to takes you </v>
<v Speaker 3>into a dreamy drunk zone.</v>

3165
02:38:42.470 --> 02:38:43.070
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's,</v>

3166
02:38:43.100 --> 02:38:46.110
<v Speaker 4>it's in many ways a toxin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3167
02:38:46.800 --> 02:38:48.580
<v Speaker 4>It's toxic in some forums.</v>

3168
02:38:48.860 --> 02:38:50.050
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it contains a,</v>

3169
02:38:50.051 --> 02:38:55.040
<v Speaker 3>another chemical in botanic acid that is</v>
<v Speaker 3>potentially very toxic,</v>

3170
02:38:55.041 --> 02:38:56.920
<v Speaker 3>although it hasn't really been examined.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

3171
02:38:56.960 --> 02:39:01.960
<v Speaker 3>it also contains a complex of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>element vanadium that could potentially </v>

3172
02:39:01.960 --> 02:39:05.501
<v Speaker 3>be toxic as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there are some legitimate toxicity </v>

3173
02:39:05.501 --> 02:39:06.950
<v Speaker 3>concerns that I think anyone who's </v>
<v Speaker 3>consuming it should be aware of.</v>

3174
02:39:07.220 --> 02:39:08.690
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3175
02:39:08.691 --> 02:39:11.150
<v Speaker 3>the ideal situation would be isolated </v>
<v Speaker 3>Moscow mall,</v>

3176
02:39:11.151 --> 02:39:13.280
<v Speaker 3>but it's hard to extract.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hm.</v>

3177
02:39:13.620 --> 02:39:18.540
<v Speaker 4>And but yet it's connected in so much </v>
<v Speaker 4>artwork and so,</v>

3178
02:39:18.541 --> 02:39:23.541
<v Speaker 4>so much ancient depictions of </v>
<v Speaker 4>particularly of Christmas cards.</v>

3179
02:39:23.641 --> 02:39:27.180
<v Speaker 4>There's always elves and these little </v>
<v Speaker 4>laminated miscarried caps.</v>

3180
02:39:27.330 --> 02:39:27.900
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3181
02:39:27.901 --> 02:39:32.901
<v Speaker 3>drugs aside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to acknowledge that it's a </v>

3182
02:39:32.901 --> 02:39:33.140
<v Speaker 3>spectacularly beautiful mushrooms if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

3183
02:39:33.390 --> 02:39:38.390
<v Speaker 3>I've gotten mushroom hunting all over </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world and there is no question that </v>

3184
02:39:38.390 --> 02:39:41.850
<v Speaker 3>when you see that mushroom in habitat </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's</v>

3185
02:39:42.160 --> 02:39:44.760
<v Speaker 4>completely spectacular.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing else like it.</v>

3186
02:39:44.761 --> 02:39:46.990
<v Speaker 4>It is magical experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just looking at it.</v>

3187
02:39:47.050 --> 02:39:50.200
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I ran across it only once in Colorado in</v>

3188
02:39:50.201 --> 02:39:52.440
<v Speaker 4>the woods and it was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like this big.</v>

3189
02:39:52.490 --> 02:39:54.370
<v Speaker 4>It was a big one too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is this big,</v>

3190
02:39:54.371 --> 02:39:59.371
<v Speaker 4>beautiful red with white dots on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like one of the most gorgeous </v>

3191
02:39:59.371 --> 02:39:59.620
<v Speaker 4>things you could ever see growing.</v>

3192
02:39:59.810 --> 02:39:59.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3193
02:40:00.320 --> 02:40:01.190
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3194
02:40:01.220 --> 02:40:04.400
<v Speaker 4>And it's legal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's legal to possess again.</v>

3195
02:40:04.401 --> 02:40:09.401
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's legal because it's not really do </v>

3196
02:40:09.401 --> 02:40:11.760
<v Speaker 4>anything enjoyable for most people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but is it possible that we just are </v>

3197
02:40:11.760 --> 02:40:14.640
<v Speaker 4>doing it wrong and that the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the information</v>

3198
02:40:14.670 --> 02:40:19.670
<v Speaker 2>has been lost as to how to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because a lot of people felt like it </v>

3199
02:40:19.670 --> 02:40:23.331
<v Speaker 2>might've been a part of Soma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which hasn't really been defined as to </v>

3200
02:40:23.331 --> 02:40:23.331
<v Speaker 2>what Soma is,</v>

3201
02:40:23.331 --> 02:40:25.800
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had those debates are not really my,</v>

3202
02:40:25.801 --> 02:40:27.180
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my cup of tea,</v>

3203
02:40:27.200 --> 02:40:30.990
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like just tons of guys pushing this</v>

3204
02:40:30.991 --> 02:40:34.350
<v Speaker 3>or that argument without like a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>evidence one way or the other.</v>

3205
02:40:34.560 --> 02:40:39.560
<v Speaker 3>And so I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there's people that argue that </v>

3206
02:40:39.560 --> 02:40:42.261
<v Speaker 3>urine drinking is somehow required to </v>
<v Speaker 3>concentrate the muskeg mall in one way </v>

3207
02:40:44.011 --> 02:40:45.210
<v Speaker 3>or another.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3208
02:40:45.320 --> 02:40:46.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you want to learn about it,</v>

3209
02:40:46.921 --> 02:40:51.921
<v Speaker 3>I think the best way to do it is </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually through this other related </v>

3210
02:40:51.921 --> 02:40:51.921
<v Speaker 3>drug.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got Box at all,</v>

3211
02:40:51.921 --> 02:40:51.960
<v Speaker 3>which was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3212
02:40:53.550 --> 02:40:57.180
<v Speaker 3>almost developed by merck as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>competitor for Ambien.</v>

3213
02:40:57.390 --> 02:41:02.390
<v Speaker 3>And there's some high dose reports of </v>
<v Speaker 3>gearbox and all that gives you a much </v>

3214
02:41:02.390 --> 02:41:03.210
<v Speaker 3>clearer example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And from my own experience as well,</v>

3215
02:41:03.211 --> 02:41:07.230
<v Speaker 3>of what the potential of that class is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's very different.</v>

3216
02:41:07.350 --> 02:41:10.470
<v Speaker 3>It's every bit as powerful as Iowasca or</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

3217
02:41:10.620 --> 02:41:15.240
<v Speaker 3>But completely different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's hard to articulate.</v>

3218
02:41:15.241 --> 02:41:20.241
<v Speaker 3>All these things are hard to articulate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's something that's been </v>

3219
02:41:20.241 --> 02:41:22.221
<v Speaker 3>experienced by relatively few people so </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you don't even have this a </v>

3220
02:41:22.221 --> 02:41:23.640
<v Speaker 3>spiritual or metaphorical vocabulary for</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

3221
02:41:23.670 --> 02:41:28.670
<v Speaker 3>The way that I hadn't most powerfully </v>
<v Speaker 3>was once I was doing a shoot for vice on</v>

3222
02:41:28.831 --> 02:41:33.831
<v Speaker 3>Hbo and they told me I had to go to </v>
<v Speaker 3>Tokyo with less than 24 hours notice and</v>

3223
02:41:34.381 --> 02:41:37.200
<v Speaker 3>that I had to start filming as soon as </v>
<v Speaker 3>the plane landed,</v>

3224
02:41:37.380 --> 02:41:38.970
<v Speaker 3>couldn't go to the hotel room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I thought,</v>

3225
02:41:38.971 --> 02:41:40.230
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is serious.</v>

3226
02:41:40.500 --> 02:41:42.510
<v Speaker 3>No messing around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No time for jet lag.</v>

3227
02:41:42.600 --> 02:41:46.190
<v Speaker 3>Like I've got to fall asleep at 10:00</v>
<v Speaker 3>PM that night.</v>

3228
02:41:46.191 --> 02:41:47.810
<v Speaker 3>Wake up at 8:00</v>
<v Speaker 3>AM that morning.</v>

3229
02:41:47.811 --> 02:41:52.811
<v Speaker 3>I've got to be awake all day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm in a pharmacologically forced </v>

3230
02:41:52.811 --> 02:41:55.991
<v Speaker 3>this a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to take a really high dose of </v>

3231
02:41:55.991 --> 02:41:58.181
<v Speaker 3>this mosquito old derivative at night to</v>
<v Speaker 3>induce sleep and I'll take adderall </v>

3232
02:41:58.181 --> 02:41:58.181
<v Speaker 3>during the day.</v>

3233
02:41:58.181 --> 02:42:00.050
<v Speaker 3>That was the plan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I took a high dose,</v>

3234
02:42:00.051 --> 02:42:03.650
<v Speaker 3>I believe it was 45 milligrams,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but don't quote me on that.</v>

3235
02:42:03.651 --> 02:42:08.651
<v Speaker 3>Of this musket mule derivative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's about the same potency and I'm at </v>

3236
02:42:08.651 --> 02:42:10.490
<v Speaker 3>the equivalent of what would have been </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe 2:00</v>

3237
02:42:10.490 --> 02:42:15.490
<v Speaker 3>PM New York time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I think was crucial because these </v>

3238
02:42:15.490 --> 02:42:15.490
<v Speaker 3>things are hypnotic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They induce sleep.</v>

3239
02:42:15.490 --> 02:42:19.961
<v Speaker 3>So if you take it during the day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're less likely to sleep through the </v>

3240
02:42:19.961 --> 02:42:22.160
<v Speaker 3>whole experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was unbelievable.</v>

3241
02:42:22.340 --> 02:42:22.910
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3242
02:42:22.911 --> 02:42:23.550
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3243
02:42:24.050 --> 02:42:28.470
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't fathom the intensity of what </v>
<v Speaker 3>I experienced.</v>

3244
02:42:28.471 --> 02:42:29.220
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3245
02:42:29.490 --> 02:42:34.490
<v Speaker 3>just this rushing sense of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of becoming a passive observer in my own</v>

3246
02:42:36.541 --> 02:42:41.541
<v Speaker 3>consciousness and seeing all of my </v>
<v Speaker 3>thoughts produced by someone else that </v>

3247
02:42:43.571 --> 02:42:48.571
<v Speaker 3>we're racing at a speed that was so fast</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I found it physically dizzying and </v>

3248
02:42:48.701 --> 02:42:53.701
<v Speaker 3>had to lay down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I felt as if like the acceleration </v>

3249
02:42:53.701 --> 02:42:57.781
<v Speaker 3>was pushing me toward an ultimate state </v>
<v Speaker 3>that was sleep and that sleep in death </v>

3250
02:42:57.781 --> 02:42:59.650
<v Speaker 3>represented the ultimate state of </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness.</v>

3251
02:43:00.480 --> 02:43:02.200
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was,</v>

3252
02:43:02.320 --> 02:43:03.070
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then,</v>

3253
02:43:03.071 --> 02:43:08.071
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I had to wake up at eight and work </v>

3254
02:43:08.071 --> 02:43:08.071
<v Speaker 3>the next day and people say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how'd you sleep?</v>

3255
02:43:08.071 --> 02:43:08.071
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3256
02:43:08.071 --> 02:43:08.071
<v Speaker 3>I actually had this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3257
02:43:08.410 --> 02:43:13.220
<v Speaker 3>a transformative existential trip </v>
<v Speaker 3>accidentally.</v>

3258
02:43:15.880 --> 02:43:19.550
<v Speaker 3>But you tried it since?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just purposely for,</v>

3259
02:43:19.590 --> 02:43:21.110
<v Speaker 3>I mean a couple of times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3260
02:43:21.270 --> 02:43:23.120
<v Speaker 3>Did you ever recreate that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience?</v>

3261
02:43:23.420 --> 02:43:24.530
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it was,</v>

3262
02:43:24.560 --> 02:43:29.560
<v Speaker 3>it was a bit much I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I know people that have taken even </v>

3263
02:43:29.560 --> 02:43:30.800
<v Speaker 3>more and it turns into just your entire </v>
<v Speaker 3>visual field,</v>

3264
02:43:30.860 --> 02:43:35.860
<v Speaker 3>a transforming into rotating cubes where</v>
<v Speaker 3>each face of the cube represents a </v>

3265
02:43:35.860 --> 02:43:37.610
<v Speaker 3>different aspect of your life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your future,</v>

3266
02:43:37.611 --> 02:43:38.900
<v Speaker 3>your past,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your present,</v>

3267
02:43:39.140 --> 02:43:41.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really dramatic stuff.</v>

3268
02:43:41.991 --> 02:43:45.290
<v Speaker 3>So I think that potential exists with </v>
<v Speaker 3>high dose Moscow mule.</v>

3269
02:43:45.291 --> 02:43:49.910
<v Speaker 3>It's hard for people to ingest it </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of all the other material in the</v>

3270
02:43:49.911 --> 02:43:52.880
<v Speaker 3>mushroom and the disgustingness of </v>
<v Speaker 3>consuming it.</v>

3271
02:43:53.130 --> 02:43:58.130
<v Speaker 2>So is it possible that we've just much </v>
<v Speaker 2>like people have sort of a altered many </v>

3272
02:44:00.971 --> 02:44:05.971
<v Speaker 2>different things like we and tomatoes </v>
<v Speaker 2>and what have you that at one point in </v>

3273
02:44:06.021 --> 02:44:08.060
<v Speaker 2>time the mushrooms somehow different?</v>

3274
02:44:08.680 --> 02:44:10.510
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well yes,</v>

3275
02:44:10.511 --> 02:44:11.740
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3276
02:44:11.741 --> 02:44:14.920
<v Speaker 3>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the evolutionary chemical history of all</v>

3277
02:44:14.921 --> 02:44:19.921
<v Speaker 3>these different plants is a fascinating </v>
<v Speaker 3>subject that's pretty much lost to </v>

3278
02:44:19.921 --> 02:44:19.921
<v Speaker 3>history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3279
02:44:19.921 --> 02:44:24.210
<v Speaker 3>there's no like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>archeological alkaloid analysis that I'm</v>

3280
02:44:24.211 --> 02:44:29.211
<v Speaker 3>aware of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it would be so fascinating to know </v>

3281
02:44:29.211 --> 02:44:29.460
<v Speaker 3>because all of these natural products </v>
<v Speaker 3>evolve,</v>

3282
02:44:29.461 --> 02:44:33.600
<v Speaker 3>just like the plants that contain them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What were the intermediate materials?</v>

3283
02:44:33.601 --> 02:44:38.601
<v Speaker 3>What drugs have gone extinct have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did our ancestors drive certain </v>

3284
02:44:38.601 --> 02:44:43.581
<v Speaker 3>psychoactive plants to extinction?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a plant called psyllium that </v>

3285
02:44:43.581 --> 02:44:44.100
<v Speaker 3>some people have argued that may have </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened with those,</v>

3286
02:44:44.101 --> 02:44:45.910
<v Speaker 3>a fennel derivative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3287
02:44:46.350 --> 02:44:49.320
<v Speaker 3>or like a fennel related plant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

3288
02:44:49.340 --> 02:44:50.400
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3289
02:44:50.401 --> 02:44:51.600
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really,</v>

3290
02:44:51.840 --> 02:44:53.520
<v Speaker 3>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've seen it with cannabis,</v>

3291
02:44:53.521 --> 02:44:58.521
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the black market encouraged everyone to </v>

3292
02:44:58.521 --> 02:45:00.880
<v Speaker 3>produce thc dominant strains because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was the most potent,</v>

3293
02:45:00.881 --> 02:45:02.680
<v Speaker 3>most stoning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most bang for your buck.</v>

3294
02:45:02.830 --> 02:45:07.830
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now we have the ability to change the </v>

3295
02:45:07.830 --> 02:45:10.441
<v Speaker 3>evolutionary direction of the plant and </v>
<v Speaker 3>to encourage the production of CBN or </v>

3296
02:45:10.441 --> 02:45:14.911
<v Speaker 3>CBG or Hcv or cbd or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hm.</v>

3297
02:45:15.730 --> 02:45:16.540
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

3298
02:45:17.420 --> 02:45:22.420
<v Speaker 2>when you talk about a plant like the pod</v>
<v Speaker 2>cactus that grows so incredibly slow and</v>

3299
02:45:25.340 --> 02:45:26.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

3300
02:45:26.360 --> 02:45:30.590
<v Speaker 2>if that became something that was highly</v>
<v Speaker 2>sought after,</v>

3301
02:45:30.860 --> 02:45:32.510
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very valuable,</v>

3302
02:45:32.810 --> 02:45:35.210
<v Speaker 2>it could conceivably be wiped out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3303
02:45:35.270 --> 02:45:36.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially something really.</v>

3304
02:45:36.291 --> 02:45:40.300
<v Speaker 2>So I'm so there could have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>substances like that,</v>

3305
02:45:40.301 --> 02:45:45.200
<v Speaker 2>that we're very geographically local,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that very small area that are just gone.</v>

3306
02:45:45.610 --> 02:45:47.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a thought.</v>

3307
02:45:47.381 --> 02:45:52.381
<v Speaker 3>I just had totally done evidence based,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but wouldn't it be crazy if a lot of the</v>

3308
02:45:53.621 --> 02:45:55.160
<v Speaker 3>reason that a lot of these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3309
02:45:56.390 --> 02:46:01.390
<v Speaker 3>psychoactive plants that are present </v>
<v Speaker 3>today tend to be less addictive is </v>

3310
02:46:01.390 --> 02:46:04.841
<v Speaker 3>because all the addictive ones were </v>
<v Speaker 3>harvested to extinction thousands of </v>

3311
02:46:04.841 --> 02:46:06.050
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe something like that.</v>

3312
02:46:06.051 --> 02:46:11.051
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these things do happen if you didn't </v>

3313
02:46:11.051 --> 02:46:13.471
<v Speaker 3>have know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We really wouldn't have any way of </v>

3314
02:46:13.471 --> 02:46:13.471
<v Speaker 3>knowing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if there fossilized plants,</v>

3315
02:46:13.471 --> 02:46:13.790
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

3316
02:46:13.791 --> 02:46:17.040
<v Speaker 3>It certainly didn't happen with coca,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which contains cocaine or cat.</v>

3317
02:46:17.060 --> 02:46:19.330
<v Speaker 3>So it probably didn't happen that way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

3318
02:46:19.331 --> 02:46:21.100
<v Speaker 3>you just don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3319
02:46:21.101 --> 02:46:24.010
<v Speaker 3>And I had read some theories that it's</v>

3320
02:46:24.440 --> 02:46:28.910
<v Speaker 2>conceivable that the emoney to miscarry </v>
<v Speaker 2>a very seasonably uh,</v>

3321
02:46:28.911 --> 02:46:32.330
<v Speaker 2>so you have to figure out like when is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the right time to harvest?</v>

3322
02:46:32.390 --> 02:46:35.420
<v Speaker 2>Because there are some plans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although of course fungus isn't really a</v>

3323
02:46:35.421 --> 02:46:37.490
<v Speaker 2>plant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of the opposite of a plan that</v>

3324
02:46:37.491 --> 02:46:38.690
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And ingest oxygen,</v>

3325
02:46:39.140 --> 02:46:41.630
<v Speaker 2>it takes in carbon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it takes an oxygen.</v>

3326
02:46:41.631 --> 02:46:44.510
<v Speaker 2>And breathe out carbon dioxide like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like an animal does,</v>

3327
02:46:45.110 --> 02:46:49.700
<v Speaker 2>but that it's possible that these things</v>
<v Speaker 2>vary seasonably,</v>

3328
02:46:49.730 --> 02:46:54.730
<v Speaker 2>that you have to catch them within a </v>
<v Speaker 2>window of time and that they also vary </v>

3329
02:46:54.890 --> 02:46:59.890
<v Speaker 2>geographically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like some places they might be more </v>

3330
02:46:59.890 --> 02:46:59.890
<v Speaker 2>potent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3331
02:46:59.890 --> 02:47:00.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cuban cigars,</v>

3332
02:47:00.411 --> 02:47:02.690
<v Speaker 2>grown on specific land,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a distinct,</v>

3333
02:47:02.710 --> 02:47:05.590
<v Speaker 3>probably more a more potent taste to </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

3334
02:47:05.890 --> 02:47:07.120
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

3335
02:47:07.121 --> 02:47:12.121
<v Speaker 3>Because the biosynthetic precursors for </v>
<v Speaker 3>all of these natural products come from </v>

3336
02:47:12.121 --> 02:47:12.121
<v Speaker 3>the soil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Typically,</v>

3337
02:47:12.121 --> 02:47:13.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>amino acids and things like that,</v>

3338
02:47:13.931 --> 02:47:18.250
<v Speaker 3>and it's all going to change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was an amazing experiment that was</v>

3339
02:47:18.251 --> 02:47:23.251
<v Speaker 3>done where they started doping the </v>
<v Speaker 3>substrate of psilocybin containing </v>

3340
02:47:23.251 --> 02:47:25.030
<v Speaker 3>mushrooms with other tryptamines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they used,</v>

3341
02:47:25.031 --> 02:47:30.031
<v Speaker 3>instead of the DDT and dip tea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put it in the substrate and they found </v>

3342
02:47:30.031 --> 02:47:34.741
<v Speaker 3>that the mushroom would take that </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely synthetic chemical that does </v>

3343
02:47:34.741 --> 02:47:37.801
<v Speaker 3>not occur in nature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would then four hydroxylase indole </v>

3344
02:47:37.801 --> 02:47:42.151
<v Speaker 3>ring just like it were a silicon </v>
<v Speaker 3>derivative and create natural product </v>

3345
02:47:42.151 --> 02:47:42.580
<v Speaker 3>derivatives of these synthetic </v>
<v Speaker 3>materials.</v>

3346
02:47:42.581 --> 02:47:47.581
<v Speaker 3>Creating these semi-synthetic hybrids </v>
<v Speaker 3>between men and mushroom creations.</v>

3347
02:47:48.680 --> 02:47:49.760
<v Speaker 3>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3348
02:47:50.520 --> 02:47:52.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is like why the synthetic,</v>

3349
02:47:52.771 --> 02:47:55.680
<v Speaker 3>natural dichotomy doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything's evolving,</v>

3350
02:47:55.681 --> 02:47:58.560
<v Speaker 3>it's a constant interplay between human </v>
<v Speaker 3>and plants and fungus,</v>

3351
02:47:58.620 --> 02:48:00.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after we're all gone,</v>

3352
02:48:00.870 --> 02:48:05.870
<v Speaker 3>all of our plastic bottles are going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be consumed by some bacterium that </v>

3353
02:48:06.571 --> 02:48:10.150
<v Speaker 3>evolves to degrade all of these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3354
02:48:10.380 --> 02:48:15.380
<v Speaker 3>polymers and that will create natural </v>
<v Speaker 3>products from them and will those </v>

3355
02:48:15.380 --> 02:48:16.510
<v Speaker 3>natural products,</v>
<v Speaker 3>natural products,</v>

3356
02:48:16.511 --> 02:48:19.000
<v Speaker 3>because they were derived from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>substrate that we created,</v>

3357
02:48:19.160 --> 02:48:24.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it turns into like a very complicated </v>

3358
02:48:24.160 --> 02:48:24.220
<v Speaker 3>issue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is why I don't believe in the idea</v>

3359
02:48:24.221 --> 02:48:25.210
<v Speaker 3>of natural and synthetic.</v>

3360
02:48:25.210 --> 02:48:28.510
<v Speaker 3>Everything is simultaneously natural and</v>
<v Speaker 3>simultaneously synthetic.</v>

3361
02:48:28.540 --> 02:48:30.370
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything comes from Earth.</v>

3362
02:48:30.430 --> 02:48:35.430
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So even the most unnatural things that </v>

3363
02:48:35.430 --> 02:48:36.070
<v Speaker 3>human beings are created are in </v>
<v Speaker 3>essential natural creations.</v>

3364
02:48:36.071 --> 02:48:39.670
<v Speaker 3>Like a b creates a beehive of beehives </v>
<v Speaker 3>and natural creation.</v>

3365
02:48:39.940 --> 02:48:41.810
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3366
02:48:41.840 --> 02:48:44.580
<v Speaker 3>It's a mind fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So to get back to emoney,</v>

3367
02:48:44.581 --> 02:48:45.300
<v Speaker 3>to miscarry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3368
02:48:45.460 --> 02:48:50.460
<v Speaker 3>do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you know of anyone who's affectively </v>

3369
02:48:50.460 --> 02:48:52.170
<v Speaker 3>regularly used it as a psychedelic?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

3370
02:48:52.230 --> 02:48:57.230
<v Speaker 3>I've met but not people who I wacky </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

3371
02:48:59.570 --> 02:49:01.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine.</v>

3372
02:49:01.131 --> 02:49:01.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not.</v>

3373
02:49:01.920 --> 02:49:03.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People where it's like,</v>

3374
02:49:03.021 --> 02:49:04.980
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy's a professor and he uses Amany</v>

3375
02:49:04.981 --> 02:49:07.040
<v Speaker 3>to every night to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's doing really?</v>

3376
02:49:07.430 --> 02:49:08.310
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yes,</v>

3377
02:49:08.311 --> 02:49:09.360
<v Speaker 3>wacky people,</v>

3378
02:49:09.610 --> 02:49:11.320
<v Speaker 2>there's so much lower,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

3379
02:49:11.321 --> 02:49:14.200
<v Speaker 2>a attached to it specifically because </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Christian,</v>

3380
02:49:14.380 --> 02:49:17.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean the books by allegro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

3381
02:49:17.360 --> 02:49:18.340
<v Speaker 2>we're big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3382
02:49:18.341 --> 02:49:22.870
<v Speaker 2>One of them was the Dead Sea Scrolls in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Christian myth and it was one of his</v>

3383
02:49:22.871 --> 02:49:27.871
<v Speaker 2>books and that was the second book that </v>
<v Speaker 2>he published after the sacred mushroom </v>

3384
02:49:27.871 --> 02:49:31.921
<v Speaker 2>in the cross.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he did that because they took </v>

3385
02:49:31.921 --> 02:49:31.921
<v Speaker 2>the sacred mushroom and the cross off </v>
<v Speaker 2>the market.</v>

3386
02:49:31.921 --> 02:49:33.550
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what did the Catholic Church by out</v>

3387
02:49:33.551 --> 02:49:36.220
<v Speaker 2>the rights for that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or was that a myth as well?</v>

3388
02:49:36.310 --> 02:49:38.530
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was something along those lines,</v>

3389
02:49:38.531 --> 02:49:43.531
<v Speaker 2>but Yon Irvin republished it fairly </v>
<v Speaker 2>recently with the blessings of the </v>

3390
02:49:43.781 --> 02:49:46.060
<v Speaker 2>allegro family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

3391
02:49:46.500 --> 02:49:49.950
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the whole connection to Santa Claus</v>

3392
02:49:50.220 --> 02:49:52.950
<v Speaker 2>and the whole connection to Christmas </v>
<v Speaker 2>with that mushroom,</v>

3393
02:49:52.951 --> 02:49:55.080
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so much attached to that.</v>

3394
02:49:55.081 --> 02:49:58.560
<v Speaker 2>Mushroom people want that mushroom to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>

3395
02:49:58.600 --> 02:49:59.810
<v Speaker 2>That's the one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3396
02:49:59.910 --> 02:50:02.970
<v Speaker 2>that's the way it's the prettiest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it grows.</v>

3397
02:50:02.971 --> 02:50:06.000
<v Speaker 2>It's got a Michael Riser relationship </v>
<v Speaker 2>with coniferous trees.</v>

3398
02:50:06.001 --> 02:50:11.001
<v Speaker 2>So you find it underneath pine trees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like the shiny presence underneath </v>

3399
02:50:11.491 --> 02:50:16.491
<v Speaker 2>the Christmas tree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So people get so excited about that </v>

3400
02:50:16.491 --> 02:50:16.491
<v Speaker 2>mushroom.</v>

3401
02:50:16.491 --> 02:50:20.080
<v Speaker 3>Yes they do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yet no one gets off on it except </v>

3402
02:50:20.080 --> 02:50:20.080
<v Speaker 3>wacky people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3403
02:50:20.080 --> 02:50:22.310
<v Speaker 3>It's a complicated situation and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

3404
02:50:22.580 --> 02:50:26.330
<v Speaker 3>just because something's convenient </v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't a good reason to say that it's the</v>

3405
02:50:26.331 --> 02:50:31.331
<v Speaker 3>truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are other psychoactive mushrooms </v>

3406
02:50:31.331 --> 02:50:34.000
<v Speaker 3>that may have been used in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're ones that we've discovered </v>

3407
02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:34.000
<v Speaker 3>recently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a species called Rodo,</v>

3408
02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:35.390
<v Speaker 3>Columbia Maculotta,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as far as I know,</v>

3409
02:50:35.391 --> 02:50:38.300
<v Speaker 3>that there's no information about humans</v>
<v Speaker 3>consuming this mushroom,</v>

3410
02:50:38.301 --> 02:50:42.350
<v Speaker 3>but it contains this Salvinorin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a type kappa opioid agonist.</v>

3411
02:50:42.380 --> 02:50:45.110
<v Speaker 3>This could be a completely different </v>
<v Speaker 3>type of psychedelic mushroom.</v>

3412
02:50:45.350 --> 02:50:50.350
<v Speaker 3>No information on it exists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe someone used it somewhere in the </v>

3413
02:50:50.350 --> 02:50:50.350
<v Speaker 3>past.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3414
02:50:50.350 --> 02:50:50.350
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

3415
02:50:51.350 --> 02:50:52.310
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't there?</v>

3416
02:50:52.311 --> 02:50:57.311
<v Speaker 2>There are some psychedelic substances </v>
<v Speaker 2>that have been discovered that have no </v>

3417
02:50:57.311 --> 02:50:59.800
<v Speaker 2>history of human use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like isn't Hawaiian baby.</v>

3418
02:50:59.801 --> 02:51:00.880
<v Speaker 2>Woodrow says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3419
02:51:01.070 --> 02:51:03.850
<v Speaker 2>you say it doesn't have lsd like </v>
<v Speaker 2>properties,</v>

3420
02:51:03.851 --> 02:51:05.200
<v Speaker 2>but no history of human use.</v>

3421
02:51:05.680 --> 02:51:07.820
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a complicated question.</v>

3422
02:51:07.821 --> 02:51:12.821
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's maybe not with Hawaiian baby </v>

3423
02:51:12.821 --> 02:51:12.821
<v Speaker 3>woodrow is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but with morning glory seeds,</v>

3424
02:51:12.821 --> 02:51:15.230
<v Speaker 3>there does seem to be some mezo American</v>
<v Speaker 3>history,</v>

3425
02:51:15.231 --> 02:51:18.170
<v Speaker 3>although it's not as well founded</v>

3426
02:51:18.230 --> 02:51:20.480
<v Speaker 2>and morning glory seeds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll put you on the moon,</v>

3427
02:51:20.481 --> 02:51:20.840
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3428
02:51:21.640 --> 02:51:22.000
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

3429
02:51:22.001 --> 02:51:24.730
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they contain Lsa and um,</v>

3430
02:51:25.270 --> 02:51:30.270
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lsa is actually Albert Hoffman did as </v>

3431
02:51:30.270 --> 02:51:32.820
<v Speaker 3>the inventor of Lsd did it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiment where he injected himself </v>

3432
02:51:32.820 --> 02:51:34.900
<v Speaker 3>with small quantities of Lsa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there aren't many evaluations of the</v>

3433
02:51:34.901 --> 02:51:39.901
<v Speaker 3>pure material.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the exact nature of the different </v>

3434
02:51:39.901 --> 02:51:44.521
<v Speaker 3>components in those seeds remains a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit mysterious as far as I'm </v>

3435
02:51:44.521 --> 02:51:48.331
<v Speaker 3>concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people will suggest that it's the </v>

3436
02:51:48.331 --> 02:51:48.331
<v Speaker 3>strongest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>naturally occurring psychedelic.</v>

3437
02:51:48.331 --> 02:51:50.830
<v Speaker 3>Other people will say that it's not even</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic at all,</v>

3438
02:51:50.831 --> 02:51:55.120
<v Speaker 3>that it's just a hypnotic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just has a sort of sedating quality.</v>

3439
02:51:55.240 --> 02:51:59.150
<v Speaker 3>I've used Hawaiian baby wardrobes many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many years ago and um,</v>

3440
02:51:59.260 --> 02:52:04.260
<v Speaker 3>it's certainly psychoactive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether I'd call it classically </v>

3441
02:52:04.260 --> 02:52:06.580
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic is a complicated issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's of like a dreamy,</v>

3442
02:52:06.580 --> 02:52:10.150
<v Speaker 1>unpleasant delirium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hm.</v>

3443
02:52:12.240 --> 02:52:17.240
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any other ones that we could go to that </v>

3444
02:52:17.240 --> 02:52:18.730
<v Speaker 1>are weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watch my show.</v>

3445
02:52:18.731 --> 02:52:20.590

<v Speaker 1>I'm sure I'd like it.</v>

3446
02:52:20.591 --> 02:52:21.910
<v Speaker 1>I like all your stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3447
02:52:22.300 --> 02:52:24.790

<v Speaker 1>I just don't have enough time.</v>

3448
02:52:25.190 --> 02:52:28.120
<v Speaker 1>There's too many things that are cool </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

3449
02:52:28.180 --> 02:52:33.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the problems with a </v>
