3
00:00:04.001 --> 00:00:04.834
<v Speaker 1>take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The theory I believe was formulated </v>

4
00:00:06.521 --> 00:00:09.850
<v Speaker 1>before they realize how many monkeys </v>
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzees eat.</v>

5
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.160
<v Speaker 1>What chimps attack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People that go for your balls.</v>

6
00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:13.700

<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

7
00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.900
<v Speaker 1>They try to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your Genitalia isn't a weird now that we</v>

<v Speaker 4>you know what I'm saying?</v>

81
00:04:22.301 --> 00:04:25.120
<v Speaker 4>Like I've met some people who yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're breathing,</v>

82
00:04:25.121 --> 00:04:25.954
<v Speaker 4>but that's it really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I used to live with these rich people </v>

83
00:04:28.091 --> 00:04:28.924
<v Speaker 4>for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Dad used to masturbate at night and </v>

84
00:04:30.791 --> 00:04:31.624
<v Speaker 4>I would sneak out there in the kitchen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is back when the family had like a </v>

85
00:04:33.341 --> 00:04:34.600
<v Speaker 4>family computer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what?</v>

86
00:04:34.601 --> 00:04:36.130
<v Speaker 4>It was in one part of the house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

87
00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.100
<v Speaker 4>And he's over there just in the glow of </v>
<v Speaker 4>that screen,</v>

88
00:04:39.101 --> 00:04:39.934
<v Speaker 4>Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's back when the monitors were </v>

89
00:04:40.931 --> 00:04:41.621
<v Speaker 4>big,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

90
00:04:41.621 --> 00:04:44.410
<v Speaker 4>And he's just over there just fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>looking for the devil.</v>

91
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:47.860
<v Speaker 4>And he ended up getting divorced and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>was,</v>

92
00:04:47.861 --> 00:04:48.694
<v Speaker 4>I think a lot of it was because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was she annoying first and he started </v>

93
00:04:51.641 --> 00:04:55.450
<v Speaker 4>beating off or was he.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Had He beat the devil?</v>

94
00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:56.703
<v Speaker 4>I think he had a pit of it in him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The worst is if you're jerking off with </v>

95
00:04:59.021 --> 00:04:59.920
<v Speaker 4>a hat on,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I think the best would be one of those </v>

97
00:05:04.901 --> 00:05:07.630
<v Speaker 4>Chinese hats broke because if you squat </v>
<v Speaker 4>down low enough to the ground,</v>

98
00:05:07.631 --> 00:05:12.631
<v Speaker 4>you can almost hide under it and you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>the most confusing.</v>

99
00:05:12.881 --> 00:05:14.470
<v Speaker 4>It would be like one of them.</v>

<v Speaker 4>This was probably 1992,</v>

118
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.013
<v Speaker 4>but he was always dribbling it invisible</v>
<v Speaker 4>basketball and they put him in class </v>

119
00:06:12.261 --> 00:06:14.870
<v Speaker 4>with the mentally handicapped kids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was against whites.</v>

120
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:15.733
<v Speaker 4>That was the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck all these white people and when he </v>

121
00:06:19.401 --> 00:06:20.870
<v Speaker 4>was white they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is.</v>

122
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:25.670
<v Speaker 4>And I get it and I was making like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>nice smoothie and I'm fucking coked up.</v>

123
00:06:25.671 --> 00:06:26.750
<v Speaker 4>I'm partying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

124
00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.630
<v Speaker 4>living high on the hog to vests on </v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe.</v>

125
00:06:29.631 --> 00:06:30.464
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I thought,</v>

126
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:32.990
<v Speaker 4>I thought I heard something outside.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

127
00:06:32.991 --> 00:06:36.380
<v Speaker 4>Which is kind of weird to even think of </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you have a blender going.</v>

128
00:06:36.381 --> 00:06:37.214
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'll leave out of my apartment to go </v>

129
00:06:38.421 --> 00:06:39.254
<v Speaker 4>in the hallway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lock myself out with the blender going </v>

130
00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:45.940
<v Speaker 4>during in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>coked up out of my brain.</v>

131
00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:47.123
<v Speaker 4>I have to go to my landlord,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the blender shorts out and smoke </v>

132
00:06:50.361 --> 00:06:51.194
<v Speaker 4>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The fire alarm starts going off in the </v>

133
00:06:53.691 --> 00:06:54.524
<v Speaker 4>building,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right as I'm at his door knocking right </v>

134
00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:58.190
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's pissed and he's like,</v>

135
00:06:58.191 --> 00:07:00.770
<v Speaker 4>what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I didn't know what to say.</v>

136
00:07:00.771 --> 00:07:04.370
<v Speaker 4>I told them that I was throwing a late </v>
<v Speaker 4>Christmas party.</v>

137
00:07:04.371 --> 00:07:08.090
<v Speaker 4>Dude,</v>

<v Speaker 4>35.</v>

<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

142
00:07:17.551 --> 00:07:19.970
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he unlocks the door.</v>

143
00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:25.360
<v Speaker 4>There's nobody in there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>

144
00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:27.590
<v Speaker 4>I talked to your buddy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Eddie Bravo.</v>

145
00:07:27.591 --> 00:07:30.200
<v Speaker 4>And that guy is a real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's out there.</v>

146
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:31.550
<v Speaker 4>He's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's like a death,</v>

147
00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:32.473
<v Speaker 4>like a death Jack Russell almost,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know a deaf Jack Russell because </v>

148
00:07:35.301 --> 00:07:36.710
<v Speaker 4>once he gets going you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

149
00:07:36.711 --> 00:07:38.870
<v Speaker 4>Jack Russell terrier.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You ever been around with the dog?</v>

150
00:07:38.871 --> 00:07:40.520
<v Speaker 4>You open the car and then next thing you</v>
<v Speaker 4>know they're like,</v>

151
00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:41.990
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're like sick.</v>

152
00:07:41.991 --> 00:07:43.400
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but how's he depth?</v>

153
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:46.040
<v Speaker 4>Because you can't get them back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like once he goes,</v>

154
00:07:46.041 --> 00:07:49.430
<v Speaker 4>you can't say you can't get them back in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the car.</v>

155
00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:52.610
<v Speaker 4>Like you're sitting there honking the </v>
<v Speaker 4>horn.</v>

156
00:07:52.611 --> 00:07:56.780
<v Speaker 4>You can't that guys out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are other cool dogs.</v>

157
00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.550
<v Speaker 4>Isn't Jack Russell?</v>

158
00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:04.430
<v Speaker 4>That's the coolest one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's just fucking insane.</v>

159
00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:05.900
<v Speaker 4>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's bribery.</v>

160
00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:08.570
<v Speaker 4>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you saying that it's worth $200,000?</v>

161
00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:12.080
<v Speaker 4>If she sucked every Dick in the room,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it wouldn't be worth $200,000.</v>

162
00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:13.670
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no way.</v>

163
00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.530
<v Speaker 4>Who's going to pay a thousand dollars </v>
<v Speaker 4>for Hillary Clinton,</v>

164
00:08:15.531 --> 00:08:16.040
<v Speaker 4>Bro?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Job.</v>

165
00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:16.873
<v Speaker 4>Other than for the story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think she can get a lot of money for </v>

166
00:08:19.401 --> 00:08:24.401
<v Speaker 4>blowjobs using so fucking old.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right guys with this fucking down.</v>

167
00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:28.070
<v Speaker 4>Plus the Devin boot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cockies.</v>

168
00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.090
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean to you do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

169
00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:29.963
<v Speaker 4>you do the copy for this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel it just feels like a </v>

170
00:08:32.511 --> 00:08:34.270
<v Speaker 4>disrespectful turn we're taking with </v>
<v Speaker 4>Hillary.</v>

171
00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:36.183
<v Speaker 4>You don't think they put her in there </v>
<v Speaker 4>for a reason because she don't give a </v>

172
00:08:39.141 --> 00:08:42.300
<v Speaker 4>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I think they,</v>

173
00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:46.220
<v Speaker 4>they want controversy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you want people to get used to fucked</v>

174
00:08:46.221 --> 00:08:48.080
<v Speaker 4>up decisions?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're used to it.</v>

175
00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.450
<v Speaker 4>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

176
00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:51.673
<v Speaker 4>I think they.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They want that because if they ever </v>

177
00:08:53.421 --> 00:08:55.410
<v Speaker 4>needed to pull something out like </v>
<v Speaker 4>something was like,</v>

178
00:08:55.411 --> 00:08:56.190
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this motherfucker</v>

179
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:58.200
<v Speaker 5>has to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When people are like,</v>

180
00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:59.310
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it is vegas.</v>

181
00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:04.200
<v Speaker 5>There's a conspiracy theory that Hillary</v>
<v Speaker 5>Clinton's father,</v>

182
00:09:04.201 --> 00:09:05.070
<v Speaker 5>Hugh Ross,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Adam,</v>

183
00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:06.560
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm assuming he's,</v>

184
00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:11.590
<v Speaker 5>he's not alive anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he was a huge Jewish mob boss who is</v>

185
00:09:12.271 --> 00:09:16.860
<v Speaker 5>responsible for opium going into </v>
<v Speaker 5>Chicago.</v>

186
00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:19.680
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if that's real,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it makes sense to me.</v>

187
00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:22.140
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no one is ever before,</v>

188
00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:25.130
<v Speaker 5>so no one has ever been.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that him right there?</v>

189
00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:26.730
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he doesn't look like you fits in,</v>

190
00:09:26.731 --> 00:09:28.290
<v Speaker 5>does he?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How?</v>

191
00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:29.183
<v Speaker 5>No one has ever been that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I bet he went home with me when they </v>

192
00:09:33.151 --> 00:09:34.470
<v Speaker 5>first.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God,</v>

193
00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:37.520
<v Speaker 5>there was nothing like that before that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a phd.</v>

194
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:39.060
<v Speaker 5>People say that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was all staged.</v>

195
00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:39.963
<v Speaker 5>No screaming box saying that did </v>
<v Speaker 5>bieber's or fake and I'll send you a </v>

196
00:09:47.401 --> 00:09:48.280
<v Speaker 5>link.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

197
00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:52.410
<v Speaker 5>I sent you that one email that one guy </v>
<v Speaker 5>was telling me that he worked for a team</v>

198
00:09:52.411 --> 00:09:53.244
<v Speaker 5>of scientists and they're working for </v>
<v Speaker 5>pesticide company and they're told to </v>

199
00:09:55.801 --> 00:09:59.340
<v Speaker 5>the goal are we're going to do some </v>
<v Speaker 5>studies here and we want it to look like</v>

200
00:09:59.341 --> 00:09:59.790
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>

201
00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:04.200
<v Speaker 5>It seems like there's basically in a </v>
<v Speaker 5>nutshell like three kinds of science.</v>

202
00:10:04.201 --> 00:10:06.300
<v Speaker 5>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's the sign like pseudo science.</v>

203
00:10:06.301 --> 00:10:09.120
<v Speaker 5>It's like pretend science,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but for sure it's not real.</v>

204
00:10:09.121 --> 00:10:10.710
<v Speaker 5>It's false science.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pseudo science,</v>

205
00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:11.783
<v Speaker 5>and then there's the scientific facts </v>
<v Speaker 5>like for sure it's not like it's a </v>

206
00:10:15.211 --> 00:10:18.060
<v Speaker 5>scientific fact that I can get on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Internet with my iphone.</v>

207
00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:20.280
<v Speaker 5>I don't need to read a study about it </v>
<v Speaker 5>and say,</v>

208
00:10:20.281 --> 00:10:23.490
<v Speaker 5>oh actually can I know it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>My friends know it.</v>

209
00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:26.410
<v Speaker 5>And then there's the science that you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

210
00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:27.373
<v Speaker 5>you have to take the scientist word for </v>
<v Speaker 5>it because there's no way that you can </v>

211
00:10:29.671 --> 00:10:33.600
<v Speaker 5>verify that if you have to take.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to have faith in science.</v>

212
00:10:33.601 --> 00:10:35.540
<v Speaker 5>That's like a religion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But scientism,</v>

213
00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:37.170
<v Speaker 5>hold on a second.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What are you talking about?</v>

214
00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.480
<v Speaker 5>Like what particular kind of any kind of</v>
<v Speaker 5>science,</v>

215
00:10:39.481 --> 00:10:40.314
<v Speaker 5>whether it's a medical science,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you have a choice to believe in </v>

216
00:10:44.911 --> 00:10:47.790
<v Speaker 5>science that you can't verify yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could believe it,</v>

217
00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:48.953
<v Speaker 5>but you don't have to believe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you could say the experts in the </v>

218
00:10:50.371 --> 00:10:51.540
<v Speaker 5>field verify it.</v>

219
00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:54.340
<v Speaker 5>All the people who understood with all </v>
<v Speaker 5>the that we,</v>

220
00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:56.190
<v Speaker 5>all the science that we know that had </v>
<v Speaker 5>been,</v>

221
00:10:56.191 --> 00:10:57.720
<v Speaker 5>has been corrupted.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just the big ones.</v>

222
00:10:57.890 --> 00:10:59.360
<v Speaker 5>A sugar science,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

223
00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:01.200
<v Speaker 5>tobacco science,</v>
<v Speaker 5>marijuana,</v>

224
00:11:01.201 --> 00:11:02.540
<v Speaker 5>science,</v>
<v Speaker 5>vaccines,</v>

225
00:11:02.541 --> 00:11:04.770
<v Speaker 5>signs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We know for sure all,</v>

226
00:11:04.771 --> 00:11:08.670
<v Speaker 5>just those four that there's been a lot </v>
<v Speaker 5>of corruption and so it's hard to trust.</v>

227
00:11:08.671 --> 00:11:11.310
<v Speaker 5>So when someone comes out and especially</v>
<v Speaker 5>the government and NGOs,</v>

228
00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:12.630
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>our scientists,</v>

229
00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.550
<v Speaker 5>scientists say that it's safe and </v>
<v Speaker 5>effective.</v>

230
00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:16.110
<v Speaker 5>You got to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>damn,</v>

231
00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:17.870
<v Speaker 5>I don't know about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not gonna.</v>

232
00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:20.100
<v Speaker 5>Just take your word for it.</v>

234
00:11:22.471 --> 00:11:23.304
<v Speaker 5>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you guys are saying that this is safe </v>

235
00:11:24.241 --> 00:11:26.250
<v Speaker 5>and effective.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know about that.</v>

236
00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:27.630
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe it is.</v>

237
00:11:27.631 --> 00:11:28.464
<v Speaker 5>I hope it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I don't know if you've watched the </v>

238
00:11:30.631 --> 00:11:31.464
<v Speaker 5>videos of old nuclear test site,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which soldiers running towards the </v>

239
00:11:34.291 --> 00:11:35.030
<v Speaker 5>blast.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I've seen those.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

241
00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:39.430

<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

242
00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:42.930
<v Speaker 5>just like all that old footage looks </v>
<v Speaker 5>like it doesn't look authentic.</v>

243
00:11:42.931 --> 00:11:45.700
<v Speaker 5>It looks like they faked all that shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I dunno.</v>

244
00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:49.240
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm to retard nuclear bombs.</v>

245
00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.180
<v Speaker 5>Is that what you're saying to me?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

246
00:11:51.181 --> 00:11:54.320
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there a conspiracy theory that uh,</v>

247
00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:55.840
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at,</v>

248
00:11:56.060 --> 00:12:01.060
<v Speaker 4>at nuclear bombs actually don't exist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they never actually figured it out,</v>

249
00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:05.940
<v Speaker 4>but they realized that the threat of </v>
<v Speaker 4>nuclear bombs is good enough because the</v>

250
00:12:05.941 --> 00:12:07.160
<v Speaker 4>editor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can see the bottom.</v>

251
00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:09.320
<v Speaker 4>But how do you know by seeing them that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're.</v>

252
00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:12.760
<v Speaker 4>But all I'm saying is how do you know it</v>
<v Speaker 4>wasn't just a regular powerful bomb,</v>

253
00:12:12.761 --> 00:12:13.594
<v Speaker 4>like how do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you know by watching a bomb go </v>

254

<v Speaker 4>off?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you know what's nuclear nuclear </v>

255
00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.770
<v Speaker 4>nuclear bomb looks like when it blows </v>
<v Speaker 4>up?</v>

256

<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

257
00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:26.110
<v Speaker 4>How do you know if that's what kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>bomb that that is the craziest amount of</v>

258
00:12:26.111 --> 00:12:29.400
<v Speaker 4>power you could ever imagine?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do.</v>

259
00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:31.300
<v Speaker 4>You understand?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It could be a nuclear bomb.</v>

260
00:12:31.301 --> 00:12:34.500
<v Speaker 4>I'm saying all I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How can you know for sure?</v>

261

00:12:36.521 --> 00:12:37.354
<v Speaker 4>funny about the apocalypse that homeless</v>
<v Speaker 4>people are going to be psyched because </v>

263
00:12:40.571 --> 00:12:45.520
<v Speaker 4>it'd be like homeless people are waiting</v>
<v Speaker 4>for the end of the world.</v>

264
00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:48.640
<v Speaker 4>They're taking them because they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to be running shit.</v>

265
00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:50.620
<v Speaker 4>They're going to be because they know </v>
<v Speaker 4>what they're doing.</v>

266
00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:53.410
<v Speaker 4>They know bots and shit and they will </v>
<v Speaker 4>know exactly.</v>

267
00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:57.230

<v Speaker 4>It might get better.</v>

268
00:12:57.250 --> 00:13:00.210
<v Speaker 4>What's going to get crowds in favelas?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you live in a favela,</v>

269
00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:01.083
<v Speaker 4>you don't have to worry about them in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the world because it's already the end </v>

<v Speaker 4>of the world for you.</v>

<v Speaker 4>way as a comedian.</v>

307

<v Speaker 4>What's supposed to be the social column?</v>

<v Speaker 4>You want to take the way.</v>

311
00:15:19.531 --> 00:15:22.080
<v Speaker 4>I can't say I grew up on the word </v>
<v Speaker 4>retarded.</v>

312
00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:26.190
<v Speaker 4>I grew up on the word faggot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I grew up on the word.</v>

313
00:15:26.191 --> 00:15:27.024
<v Speaker 4>I grew up on a lot of words that people </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't accept today and I'm very sorry </v>

314
00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:32.183
<v Speaker 4>that you don't accept them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's too late for me to change my </v>

315
00:15:35.281 --> 00:15:37.530
<v Speaker 4>game right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

316
00:15:37.531 --> 00:15:40.110
<v Speaker 4>I'll try.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My hardest and I try my hardest.</v>

317
00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:42.540
<v Speaker 4>I'm still gonna say tranny from time to </v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

318
00:15:42.541 --> 00:15:45.210
<v Speaker 4>I know it offends.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm here to tell you how I see it.</v>

319
00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:46.553
<v Speaker 4>I see it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is how I said if I offended you </v>

320
00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:51.940
<v Speaker 4>might offend you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was the mind.</v>

321
00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:52.490
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

322
00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:53.323
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Our paper that rewrote my income was </v>

323
00:15:55.251 --> 00:15:58.520
<v Speaker 7>about allyship and they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>

324
00:15:58.521 --> 00:16:00.380
<v Speaker 7>We had two of them that did mountain </v>
<v Speaker 7>comp.</v>

325
00:16:00.381 --> 00:16:01.214
<v Speaker 7>One of them we just more or less </v>
<v Speaker 7>replaced whites would replace Jews with </v>

326
00:16:04.821 --> 00:16:06.100
<v Speaker 7>white men.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

327
00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:06.963
<v Speaker 7>so would that one.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What we did was we took the whole </v>

328
00:16:10.041 --> 00:16:13.730
<v Speaker 7>document on online and we just searched </v>
<v Speaker 7>the word Jew and we just started picking</v>

329
00:16:13.731 --> 00:16:14.564
<v Speaker 7>sentences and paragraphs.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So what was it that at the end it was </v>

330
00:16:18.141 --> 00:16:20.600
<v Speaker 7>something like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if we don't combat whiteness,</v>

331
00:16:20.601 --> 00:16:22.670
<v Speaker 7>it's going to be the funeral wreath for </v>
<v Speaker 7>mankind.</v>

332
00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:26.960
<v Speaker 7>This is why I've been telling people </v>
<v Speaker 7>clean up your room.</v>

333
00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:27.471
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

334
00:16:27.471 --> 00:16:28.304
<v Speaker 7>your room is actually network to.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's not that easy to clean up your </v>

335
00:16:30.321 --> 00:16:31.190
<v Speaker 7>room,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

336
00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:32.053
<v Speaker 7>because maybe part of it is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>is that like everything around you is </v>

337
00:16:35.181 --> 00:16:38.690
<v Speaker 7>full of potential.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Everything maybe more potential than you</v>

338
00:16:38.691 --> 00:16:39.524
<v Speaker 7>could ever possibly utilize and so maybe</v>
<v Speaker 7>all you have is this little rat hole of </v>

339
00:16:42.591 --> 00:16:44.540
<v Speaker 7>a room and some rundown place in the </v>
<v Speaker 7>world.</v>

340
00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:48.440
<v Speaker 7>It's like fix it up.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's more there than you think.</v>

341
00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:50.840
<v Speaker 7>They devalued what they have right in </v>
<v Speaker 7>front of them.</v>

342
00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:51.883
<v Speaker 7>Like another.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Another client I worked with was having </v>

343
00:16:53.751 --> 00:16:57.680
<v Speaker 7>a hard time putting his kid to bed at </v>
<v Speaker 7>night and so we did the arithmetic.</v>

344
00:16:57.681 --> 00:16:58.514
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

345
00:16:58.670 --> 00:16:59.503
<v Speaker 7>I'm fighting with my kid for 45 minutes </v>
<v Speaker 7>a night trying to get him to go to bed </v>

00:18:02.341 --> 00:18:05.200
<v Speaker 6>tweeted this about former president </v>
<v Speaker 6>Obama's advisor,</v>

369
00:18:05.201 --> 00:18:08.020
<v Speaker 6>Valerie Jarrett.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She tweeted that Valerie Jarrett,</v>

370
00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:09.113
<v Speaker 6>who was black,</v>
<v Speaker 6>was the daughter of the Muslim </v>

371
00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:14.440
<v Speaker 6>Brotherhood and planet of the Apes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We were at home in Salt Lake City.</v>

372
00:18:14.441 --> 00:18:19.441
<v Speaker 6>When I tweeted at 2:11 AM,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just woke up and I had this thought in</v>

373
00:18:20.141 --> 00:18:21.100
<v Speaker 6>my head,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh my God,</v>

374
00:18:21.101 --> 00:18:21.934
<v Speaker 6>this can make so much sense.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then I tweeted it and I went right </v>

375
00:18:26.201 --> 00:18:28.650
<v Speaker 6>back to sleep and when I woke up at </v>
<v Speaker 6>seven,</v>

376
00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:30.190
<v Speaker 6>the shit had hit the fan,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

377
00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:31.750
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I was like,</v>

378
00:18:31.751 --> 00:18:34.690
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to expound on this later.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That was one of those kinds of things,</v>

379
00:18:34.691 --> 00:18:36.820
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You just want to get it down.</v>

380
00:18:36.821 --> 00:18:37.990
<v Speaker 6>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

381
00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:41.050
<v Speaker 6>always slept with my computer and tweet </v>
<v Speaker 6>when I wake up,</v>

382
00:18:41.051 --> 00:18:43.360
<v Speaker 6>like one year old,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you have to go to the bathroom a lot.</v>

383
00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:45.070
<v Speaker 6>So I always tweet and fall back to </v>
<v Speaker 6>sleep.</v>

384
00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:48.520
<v Speaker 6>And then on the ambient tweets,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my daughter,</v>

385
00:18:48.521 --> 00:18:50.710
<v Speaker 6>I used to always,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when I took my Ambien,</v>

386
00:18:50.711 --> 00:18:52.840
<v Speaker 6>I called my daughter and she or she </v>
<v Speaker 6>called me.</v>

387
00:18:52.841 --> 00:18:53.710
<v Speaker 6>She goes,</v>

<v Speaker 6>you're starting to do the Ambien tweets.</v>

389
00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:57.730
<v Speaker 6>Get off,</v>
<v Speaker 6>get off the twitter,</v>

390
00:18:57.731 --> 00:18:59.210

<v Speaker 6>But uh,</v>

391
00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:01.990
<v Speaker 6>so I just called my daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then every night when I,</v>

392
00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:04.720
<v Speaker 6>when I was doing the Ambien and uh,</v>

<v Speaker 6>Here comes the big fish right through my</v>

<v Speaker 6>window.</v>

<v Speaker 6>That's what she goes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Mom turned it all off and go to sleep.</v>

<v Speaker 6>eight balls.</v>

398
00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:24.883
<v Speaker 6>But wasn't there another tweet that you </v>
<v Speaker 6>made a long time ago about who was that </v>

399
00:19:29.881 --> 00:19:31.440
<v Speaker 6>other woman?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Susan Rice?</v>

400
00:19:31.441 --> 00:19:32.330
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

401
00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:36.210
<v Speaker 6>What you said she has giant swing eight </v>
<v Speaker 6>balls that she's a man.</v>

402
00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:42.440
<v Speaker 6>Let me explain that now because this is </v>
<v Speaker 6>the regional listic regionalism.</v>

403
00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:48.470
<v Speaker 6>I'm from Utah and all the girls in Utah </v>
<v Speaker 6>when we got married and are we heard our</v>

404
00:19:49.201 --> 00:19:51.060
<v Speaker 6>moms do it too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's always,</v>

405
00:19:51.061 --> 00:19:52.950
<v Speaker 6>where's your ape?</v>
<v Speaker 6>They go,</v>

<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

408
00:19:56.191 --> 00:19:57.690
<v Speaker 6>he's watching football.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All good.</v>

409
00:19:57.691 --> 00:19:59.760
<v Speaker 6>Let's go out to lunch.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know it all.</v>

410
00:19:59.761 --> 00:20:04.350
<v Speaker 6>All of the men were all apes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's how it is in a breeder culture,</v>

411
00:20:04.351 --> 00:20:06.780
<v Speaker 6>like Salt Lake City,</v>
<v Speaker 6>breeder culture,</v>

412
00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:10.350
<v Speaker 6>Caribbean culture.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it's like,</v>

413
00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:12.210
<v Speaker 6>where's your ape?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And there's like,</v>

414
00:20:12.211 --> 00:20:13.044
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're a peasant big fucking swing and </v>

415
00:20:14.851 --> 00:20:16.260
<v Speaker 6>eight balls.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I give them that.</v>

416
00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:19.290
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a regional logistic thing.</v>

417
00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:20.693
<v Speaker 6>And my point is that this lonely two </v>
<v Speaker 6>things over the course of thousands of </v>

418
00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:27.810
<v Speaker 6>don't mess my point.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I said,</v>

419
00:20:27.811 --> 00:20:31.200
<v Speaker 6>Susan Rice,</v>
<v Speaker 6>let's say that she has.</v>

420
00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:36.500
<v Speaker 6>She has incredible audacity.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what I meant as she does.</v>

421
00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:39.483
<v Speaker 6>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not going to bow down before them </v>

422
00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:44.410
<v Speaker 6>and say you were right and they want me </v>
<v Speaker 6>to,</v>

423
00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:46.060
<v Speaker 6>but they weren't right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm right.</v>

424
00:20:46.061 --> 00:20:48.380
<v Speaker 6>I wrote it bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 6>bitch.</v>

425
00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:51.490
<v Speaker 9>So I know what I meant.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So you don't fucking get to tell me what</v>

426
00:20:51.491 --> 00:20:53.390
<v Speaker 9>I meant.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Here's my impression of Mel Gibson.</v>

427
00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:58.793
<v Speaker 4>He was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he just kept clicking the pen and I </v>

428
00:21:00.701 --> 00:21:01.890
<v Speaker 4>will,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't want to say anything.</v>

429
00:21:01.891 --> 00:21:02.760
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do I say?</v>

430
00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:05.910
<v Speaker 2>PNF One of the commanders of the immune </v>
<v Speaker 2>system that says,</v>

431
00:21:05.911 --> 00:21:07.080
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>

432
00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:09.510
<v Speaker 2>let's cause a bunch of inflammation and </v>
<v Speaker 2>make you miserable.</v>

433
00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:11.370
<v Speaker 2>And so the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

434
00:21:11.371 --> 00:21:13.500
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and another molecule similar,</v>

435
00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:18.240
<v Speaker 2>similar to it decreased by 50 percent </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that decreased persisted.</v>

436
00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:20.730
<v Speaker 2>But it's a um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

437
00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:25.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't have that stuff now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know if I can attribute that</v>

438
00:21:26.011 --> 00:21:26.844
<v Speaker 2>to the cells,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I got a bunch of cells like twice </v>

439
00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:33.780
<v Speaker 2>and that went away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I talk about that for a minute.</v>

440
00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:37.380
<v Speaker 2>Does that sort of a look a little harder</v>
<v Speaker 2>at it?</v>

441
00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:39.750
<v Speaker 2>And it's a mystery to me why it isn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>the case.</v>

442
00:21:39.751 --> 00:21:40.620
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

443
00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:43.950
<v Speaker 2>if there are places where one can go and</v>
<v Speaker 2>get some help,</v>

444
00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:46.650
<v Speaker 2>it sounds like the old spook around the </v>
<v Speaker 2>corner.</v>

445
00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:49.170
<v Speaker 2>Good for moles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>holes and pimples on.</v>

446
00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:51.420
<v Speaker 2>But it's a vibe.</v>

447
00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:53.670
<v Speaker 9>Incredible.</v>

448
00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:55.293
<v Speaker 4>It is a button.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You press mute or you don't have one of </v>

449
00:21:57.061 --> 00:21:57.601
<v Speaker 4>these?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I don't think he wants to lead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's been.</v>

463
00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:35.790
<v Speaker 4>He's hanging around in our lobby staring</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the Werewolf,</v>

464
00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:36.773
<v Speaker 4>said he wants one.</v>

465
00:22:36.850 --> 00:22:39.790
<v Speaker 9>We went into the war thing and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I don't know anything about war.</v>

466
00:22:39.791 --> 00:22:41.230
<v Speaker 9>I'm A.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm a guitar player,</v>

467
00:22:41.231 --> 00:22:42.064
<v Speaker 9>but I went down for my draft physical </v>
<v Speaker 9>and when I went into the booth to give </v>

468
00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:48.580
<v Speaker 9>my urine sample,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I made sure I ate Mexican food all week,</v>

469
00:22:48.581 --> 00:22:49.414
<v Speaker 9>so instead of pissing in the Urine Cup,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I took a big dump in it was green and </v>

470
00:22:52.001 --> 00:22:53.350
<v Speaker 9>went all over the place and the guy </v>
<v Speaker 9>went.</v>

471
00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:57.130
<v Speaker 9>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Really?</v>

472
00:22:57.550 --> 00:22:58.390
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Really.</v>

473
00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:01.900
<v Speaker 9>And so I made up the story for High </v>
<v Speaker 9>Times magazine,</v>

474
00:23:01.901 --> 00:23:05.710
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the great magazine of good information.</v>

475
00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:06.903
<v Speaker 9>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the Ted Hating liberal press started </v>

476
00:23:10.511 --> 00:23:11.344
<v Speaker 9>quoting the high times magazine and </v>
<v Speaker 9>quoting an ex girlfriend who claimed </v>

477
00:23:16.961 --> 00:23:21.961
<v Speaker 9>that I had adopted her,</v>
<v Speaker 9>that I had adopted my girlfriend to have</v>

478
00:23:22.751 --> 00:23:24.440
<v Speaker 9>you read that one?</v>
<v Speaker 9>I did read that one.</v>

479
00:23:24.441 --> 00:23:27.350
<v Speaker 9>I forgot about it.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So this kind of stuff,</v>

480
00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:30.770
<v Speaker 9>like you adopted her so you could take </v>
<v Speaker 9>her on tour with,</v>

481
00:23:30.771 --> 00:23:32.420
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>so I could fuck her.</v>

482
00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:36.200
<v Speaker 9>That's what the story was.</v>
<v Speaker 9>But that's APP.</v>

483
00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:38.480
<v Speaker 9>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It works.</v>

484
00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:39.343
<v Speaker 9>That's not how I think.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It makes it easier to talk to them once </v>

485
00:23:40.731 --> 00:23:43.430
<v Speaker 9>you adopt them.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I didn't adopt anybody.</v>

486
00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:48.440
<v Speaker 9>I've never shit pants since I was,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I think eight months old.</v>

487
00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:49.643
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I've never been with an underage girl </v>

488
00:23:50.781 --> 00:23:53.930
<v Speaker 9>since I was under age.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm not a racist.</v>

489
00:23:53.931 --> 00:23:54.860
<v Speaker 9>And what else do they say?</v>
<v Speaker 9>Oh,</v>

490
00:23:54.861 --> 00:23:55.694
<v Speaker 9>and they saved that.</v>
<v Speaker 9>They claim that I made Courtney love </v>

491
00:23:57.411 --> 00:23:59.930

<v Speaker 9>I think she claimed that.</v>

492
00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:01.970
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I never met Courtney love.</v>

493

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:00.073
<v Speaker 13>Monday morning I start to regain mission</v>
<v Speaker 13>to try and get the heavyweight </v>

580
00:28:05.091 --> 00:28:06.740
<v Speaker 13>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 13>Because before this,</v>

581
00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:08.103
<v Speaker 13>every time I'd have a beer,</v>
<v Speaker 13>I'd come back and I'm going to be the </v>

582
00:28:09.771 --> 00:28:11.390
<v Speaker 13>heavyweight champion of the world again </v>
<v Speaker 13>because it was,</v>

583
00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:14.450
<v Speaker 13>it was the alcohol talking.</v>
<v Speaker 13>But even when I speak to her now,</v>

584
00:28:14.451 --> 00:28:15.284
<v Speaker 13>she says,</v>

<v Speaker 13>She said,</v>

<v Speaker 13>going to be a new tyson fury.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Knee braces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did he do that?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me finish because knee braces and </v>

<v Speaker 1>six,</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

602
00:28:56.780 --> 00:28:59.620
<v Speaker 1>Standing on his back while he's doing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pushup in one year.</v>

<v Speaker 1>One year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>

604
00:29:00.761 --> 00:29:02.050

<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

<v Speaker 14>crack and the crack got bigger and all </v>

<v Speaker 14>Can't get out of the hole.</v>

<v Speaker 14>Kelly.</v>
<v Speaker 14>This is the way.</v>

619
00:29:31.790 --> 00:29:33.380
<v Speaker 14>Calm the fuck down.</v>
<v Speaker 14>Reel it in,</v>

620
00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:34.730
<v Speaker 14>reel it in.</v>
<v Speaker 14>We're here.</v>

621
00:29:34.731 --> 00:29:38.240
<v Speaker 14>We made it.</v>
<v Speaker 14>Grab control.</v>

622
00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:42.310
<v Speaker 14>Follow the cracks more up out.</v>
<v Speaker 14>Boom.</v>

623
00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:45.680
<v Speaker 15>There's the K fucking I'm out.</v>
<v Speaker 15>Made it.</v>

624
00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:51.870
<v Speaker 15>You're coming home.</v>
<v Speaker 15>You aren't talking about that was it.</v>

625
00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:56.530
<v Speaker 15>And I texted my girl,</v>
<v Speaker 15>I love you baby.</v>

626
00:29:57.820 --> 00:29:58.653
<v Speaker 15>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 15>they was fucking scary moment but </v>

627
00:30:01.031 --> 00:30:01.960
<v Speaker 15>daddy's coming home.</v>

628
00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:05.950
<v Speaker 7>So you felt calm while it was flipping?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh yeah.</v>

629
00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:08.810
<v Speaker 7>I always will.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've seen cars flipped,</v>

630
00:30:08.811 --> 00:30:10.210
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've seen it for years,</v>

631
00:30:10.270 --> 00:30:11.830
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>So I know that it's possible.</v>

632
00:30:11.831 --> 00:30:16.450
<v Speaker 7>So I get in there and I got turned </v>
<v Speaker 7>around at a race in 1998.</v>

633
00:30:16.451 --> 00:30:21.451
<v Speaker 7>I was racing at Daytona and I got turned</v>
<v Speaker 7>around and the car.</v>

634
00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:26.380
<v Speaker 7>So I'm flipping for the first time in my</v>
<v Speaker 7>life and this car's like over 3000,</v>

635
00:30:26.730 --> 00:30:27.810
<v Speaker 7>300 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So it's,</v>

636
00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:28.713
<v Speaker 7>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But it flies up in the air like it's </v>

637
00:30:30.191 --> 00:30:30.821
<v Speaker 7>paper,</v>
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>

638
00:30:30.821 --> 00:30:33.220
<v Speaker 7>It's the craziest thing in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's so you're weightless.</v>

639
00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:34.510
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's the cars flipping.</v>

640
00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:37.180
<v Speaker 7>You're pushed into the seat.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So you feel great.</v>

641
00:30:37.181 --> 00:30:40.510
<v Speaker 7>You feel weight of yourself in the seat.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That never changes.</v>

642
00:30:40.511 --> 00:30:42.700
<v Speaker 7>You never kind of come up out of the </v>
<v Speaker 7>scene like that,</v>

643
00:30:42.701 --> 00:30:45.250
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and so it's like somebody's role to prop</v>

644
00:30:45.270 --> 00:30:46.103
<v Speaker 7>walla grass up against the side of the </v>
<v Speaker 7>car and then against the roof and then </v>

645
00:30:48.371 --> 00:30:49.610
<v Speaker 7>against that side and then,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

646
00:30:49.670 --> 00:30:50.503
<v Speaker 7>it kept doing that and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's just the weirdest feeling and you </v>

647
00:30:52.901 --> 00:30:56.780
<v Speaker 7>feel completely safe and you feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

648
00:30:57.070 --> 00:30:58.360
<v Speaker 7>nothing's going to harm me.</v>

649
00:30:58.650 --> 00:31:01.140
<v Speaker 1>And in doing so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was telling this story about being in</v>

650
00:31:01.141 --> 00:31:01.974
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

651
00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:06.930
<v Speaker 1>this forensic laboratory isn't an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an autopsy was taking place.</v>

652
00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:10.800
<v Speaker 1>And this autopsy table was adjacent to </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

653
00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:11.723
<v Speaker 1>this huge indoor window that separated </v>
<v Speaker 1>the autopsy suite from this lunch room </v>

654
00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:19.380
<v Speaker 1>and in the lunch room where the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

655
00:31:19.381 --> 00:31:20.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the forensic staff,</v>

656
00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:24.840
<v Speaker 1>they're all eating their lunches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all had tuna sandwiches and cans of</v>

657
00:31:24.841 --> 00:31:25.674
<v Speaker 1>coke and barbecued potato chips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were watching through the </v>

658
00:31:29.611 --> 00:31:30.444
<v Speaker 1>window as this absolutely perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twelve year old boy was being autopsied </v>

659
00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:38.513
<v Speaker 1>and just hours before at this kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like two hours before this kid had been </v>

660
00:31:41.491 --> 00:31:44.310
<v Speaker 1>riding his bicycle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd fallen over.</v>

661
00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:47.850
<v Speaker 1>He'd hit his head on the curb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now two hours later,</v>

662
00:31:48.270 --> 00:31:51.990
<v Speaker 1>he was dead and dead without almost a </v>
<v Speaker 1>scratch on him,</v>

663
00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:57.410
<v Speaker 1>just this perfect naked dead 12 year old</v>
<v Speaker 1>boy on the autopsy table.</v>

664
00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:00.053
<v Speaker 1>And as he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the technician is eating their </v>

665
00:32:01.501 --> 00:32:02.334
<v Speaker 1>lunch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching it through a window that they </v>

666
00:32:05.251 --> 00:32:06.930
<v Speaker 1>watch as the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

667
00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:12.020
<v Speaker 1>as the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a pathologist in sizes around the top of</v>

668
00:32:12.391 --> 00:32:14.460
<v Speaker 1>the kid's face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the top of the forehead,</v>

669
00:32:14.461 --> 00:32:17.820
<v Speaker 1>the hairline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then peels the face down,</v>

670
00:32:17.970 --> 00:32:22.970
<v Speaker 1>like peeling an orange peels the entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>face off of the skull of this little boy</v>

671
00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:27.450
<v Speaker 1>and leaves the face around the neck like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mask,</v>

672
00:32:27.451 --> 00:32:32.130
<v Speaker 1>like a rubber mask.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this exposes this liver colored dark</v>

673
00:32:32.131 --> 00:32:35.910
<v Speaker 1>red musculature of the child's </v>
<v Speaker 1>underlying face.</v>

674
00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:40.910
<v Speaker 1>And this one guy watching it with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mouthful of tuna sandwich,</v>

675
00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:43.490
<v Speaker 1>he points this out and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see that?</v>

676
00:32:43.910 --> 00:32:44.743
<v Speaker 1>That there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the color of red that I want to </v>

677
00:32:46.881 --> 00:32:50.060
<v Speaker 1>paint our rec room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

678
00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:52.250
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what I do when I got the phone,</v>

679
00:32:52.550 --> 00:32:55.100
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me do this with it.</v>

680
00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:57.350
<v Speaker 1>Flip it around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

681
00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:00.290
<v Speaker 1>And I reminded myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do,</v>

682
00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:01.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

683
00:33:01.670 --> 00:33:05.090
<v Speaker 1>in the military cadets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do they twirl their gun?</v>

684
00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:07.850
<v Speaker 1>Of what possible value is this in </v>
<v Speaker 1>combat?</v>

685
00:33:08.150 --> 00:33:10.100
<v Speaker 1>Why do they do these things with their </v>
<v Speaker 1>gun?</v>

686
00:33:10.101 --> 00:33:14.100
<v Speaker 1>And then I realized you're not supposed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to drop your gun ever,</v>

687
00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:16.333
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you twirl the gun and you don't </v>

688
00:33:18.651 --> 00:33:19.484
<v Speaker 1>drop it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means stuff can happen to you in </v>

689
00:33:20.991 --> 00:33:23.630
<v Speaker 1>combat and it is always attached to your</v>
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>

690
00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:29.120
<v Speaker 1>So when I got my phone I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me just do this.</v>

691
00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:33.260
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me just do this.</v>

692
00:33:33.261 --> 00:33:38.261
<v Speaker 1>If I pick up the phone and dropped it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

693
00:33:39.201 --> 00:33:43.970
<v Speaker 1>So when you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you never drop your phone.</v>

694
00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:45.073
<v Speaker 1>So it's not that I'm a risk taker is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I've changed my risk to make it so </v>

695
00:33:49.881 --> 00:33:50.714
<v Speaker 1>low that it essentially won't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you've got apple care to get apple </v>

696
00:33:55.210 --> 00:33:57.350
<v Speaker 1>care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it's going to Bill Maher route.</v>

697
00:33:58.410 --> 00:34:00.210
<v Speaker 5>Do you purple without getting me into </v>
<v Speaker 5>the alarm.</v>

698
00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.700
<v Speaker 5>Do you have a Bill Maher character?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

702
00:34:08.930 --> 00:34:12.330
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're wrong.</v>

703
00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:16.590
<v Speaker 5>There is no god.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

704

<v Speaker 16>like the hallway.</v>

725
00:35:04.441 --> 00:35:06.990

<v Speaker 16>at the time.</v>

728
00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:11.853
<v Speaker 16>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 16>I remember I was sitting down in the </v>

<v Speaker 17>Brian says,</v>

763

<v Speaker 17>and I look and it's this fucking crazy </v>
<v Speaker 17>white dude with a fucking scar.</v>

764
00:37:06.570 --> 00:37:08.340
<v Speaker 17>When he points at Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 17>it goes,</v>

765
00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:12.180
<v Speaker 17>don't even think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 17>And like Brian was like,</v>

768
00:37:14.490 --> 00:37:16.140

<v Speaker 17>he's a character.</v>

769
00:37:16.141 --> 00:37:18.300
<v Speaker 17>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 17>I was at his first comedy show</v>

770
00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:21.400
<v Speaker 2>and Qbb who the fuck knows what's going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to happen with him,</v>

771
00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:22.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and yeah,</v>

772
00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:23.813
<v Speaker 2>I hope they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're leaning on them so we can get a </v>

773
00:37:26.201 --> 00:37:27.034
<v Speaker 2>rematch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I love watching invite first and </v>

774
00:37:29.531 --> 00:37:30.364
<v Speaker 2>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can stretch myself to understand his </v>

775
00:37:33.191 --> 00:37:35.180
<v Speaker 2>reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can stretch myself to.</v>

776
00:37:35.181 --> 00:37:38.950
<v Speaker 2>And I can't stretch myself to understand</v>
<v Speaker 2>the order guys reactions.</v>

777
00:37:39.070 --> 00:37:39.760
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

778
00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:40.541
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for Habib,</v>

779
00:37:40.541 --> 00:37:42.030
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

780
00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:43.660
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

781
00:37:43.690 --> 00:37:44.523
<v Speaker 2>it's almost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's such a foolish thing to do because </v>

782
00:37:46.270 --> 00:37:47.103
<v Speaker 2>listening to date already one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that Dylan was talking shit and </v>

783
00:37:50.021 --> 00:37:54.070
<v Speaker 2>he was angry but she didn't say anything</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I heard a few people saying that</v>

784
00:37:54.071 --> 00:37:55.330
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was standing beside dylan.</v>

785
00:37:55.570 --> 00:37:57.460
<v Speaker 2>I didn't see what he did but I could </v>
<v Speaker 2>hear.</v>

786
00:37:57.490 --> 00:37:59.410
<v Speaker 2>So he didn't say anything and I watched </v>
<v Speaker 2>it back.</v>

787
00:37:59.411 --> 00:38:01.680
<v Speaker 2>I see any kind of backing them on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

788
00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:05.240
<v Speaker 2>just stupid end the fight stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>

789
00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:07.220
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think it justified that level </v>
<v Speaker 2>of response.</v>

790
00:38:07.221 --> 00:38:08.810
<v Speaker 2>And then maybe there was something else </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the leadup,</v>

791
00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:11.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dylan is a bit of a troll online,</v>

792
00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:14.890
<v Speaker 2>so there was probably a bit of a buildup</v>
<v Speaker 2>of voter stuff.</v>

793
00:38:15.310 --> 00:38:17.020
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

794
00:38:17.021 --> 00:38:19.210
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't that big a deal to me.</v>

795
00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:21.710
<v Speaker 2>What have you did or not?</v>

796
00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:30.700
<v Speaker 2>So is that a joint or instead a cigar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

797
00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:34.700
<v Speaker 2>it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>marijuana side of a tobacco.</v>

798
00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:35.650
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

799
00:38:35.650 --> 00:38:37.960
<v Speaker 2>So it's like posh plot tobacco pot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never had that.</v>

800
00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:39.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I tried one once.</v>

801
00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:40.373
<v Speaker 2>Come on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

802
00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:43.720
<v Speaker 2>Probably can't because stockholders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

803
00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:46.870
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's legal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

804
00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:48.220
<v Speaker 2>It's totally legal.</v>

00:39:15.471 --> 00:39:18.500
<v Speaker 18>for the high profile CEO of Tesla and </v>
<v Speaker 18>space x.</v>

813
00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:21.020
<v Speaker 2>on the same day the podcast was </v>
<v Speaker 2>published,</v>

814
00:39:21.260 --> 00:39:24.230
<v Speaker 2>Tesla's chief accounting officer </v>
<v Speaker 2>announced his resignation.</v>

815
00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:26.090
<v Speaker 2>You did not cite the incident.</v>

816
00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:31.240
<v Speaker 18>So Tesla stock also took a hit plunging </v>
<v Speaker 18>more than six percent is inhaling.</v>

817
00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:34.433
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not sure.</v>

818
00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:35.453
<v Speaker 2>Mosque under fire after taking a hit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>marijuana mixed with tobacco that has </v>

819
00:39:40.051 --> 00:39:43.260
<v Speaker 2>already become a gift.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of those moving images on twitter.</v>

820
00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:44.730
<v Speaker 2>What about the pot?</v>

821
00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:48.920
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do not smoke pot as anyone who watched</v>

822
00:39:48.921 --> 00:39:51.410
<v Speaker 2>the part cost tell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea how to smoke.</v>

823
00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:55.110
<v Speaker 2>What might be a higher thinking life?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

824
00:39:55.170 --> 00:39:58.820
<v Speaker 2>he might as well be right if he was an </v>
<v Speaker 2>alien and he looked exactly like that.</v>

825
00:39:58.821 --> 00:40:01.010
<v Speaker 2>I'll be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he grabbed the joint and the way he</v>

826
00:40:01.011 --> 00:40:02.600
<v Speaker 2>kind of looked at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was kind of like,</v>

827
00:40:02.601 --> 00:40:04.730
<v Speaker 2>it seemed kind of like a guy who was </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of like,</v>

828
00:40:05.090 --> 00:40:07.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm not familiar with this practice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

829
00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:11.900
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe he's so smart that he thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be funny if you print tended.</v>

830
00:40:11.901 --> 00:40:16.901
<v Speaker 2>He didn't know what a joint was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could it be words or this summer?</v>

831
00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:19.063
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when he said that a tesla going </v>

832
00:40:21.261 --> 00:40:24.050
<v Speaker 2>private funding secure at 4:20,</v>

833
00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:27.193
<v Speaker 2>which is $20,000,000 for that joke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that joke cost them $20,000,000 to sec </v>

834
00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:32.840
<v Speaker 2>got mad at him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They find him.</v>

835
00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:37.340
<v Speaker 2>It was on your stock price is a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit.</v>

836
00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:40.400
<v Speaker 2>Well that was one of the things in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>shareholders into a panic.</v>

837
00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:41.313
<v Speaker 2>Jamie was concerned that they were going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to contact us and see if we arranged </v>

838
00:40:45.650 --> 00:40:48.770
<v Speaker 2>that pot smoking part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if that was something that had been</v>

839
00:40:48.771 --> 00:40:51.260
<v Speaker 2>arranged in advance because it crashed </v>
<v Speaker 2>the stock.</v>

840
00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:56.930
<v Speaker 2>That was what I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe Rogan making noise.</v>

841
00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:59.390
<v Speaker 2>Oh Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We didn't do that.</v>

842
00:40:59.391 --> 00:41:00.710
<v Speaker 2>Did we?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

843
00:41:00.711 --> 00:41:04.130
<v Speaker 2>No one says I'm going to bake cookies </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're an idiot.</v>

844
00:41:04.131 --> 00:41:07.610
<v Speaker 2>Fuck these people bake them cookies and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they got to like it.</v>

845

<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

849

<v Speaker 2>up as any.</v>

850
00:41:17.870 --> 00:41:18.501

<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

854

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

861
00:41:45.350 --> 00:41:47.900

<v Speaker 2>to live.</v>

868
00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:09.530
<v Speaker 19>You get up.</v>
<v Speaker 19>I'm just like,</v>

869
00:42:09.531 --> 00:42:10.364
<v Speaker 19>I'm having this late in life childhood </v>
<v Speaker 19>of getting to go to all the places that </v>

870
00:42:14.271 --> 00:42:16.630
<v Speaker 19>I dreamed about and read about,</v>
<v Speaker 19>you know,</v>

871
00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:17.633
<v Speaker 19>I love,</v>
<v Speaker 19>I grew up reading books about pirates </v>

872
00:42:18.801 --> 00:42:23.180
<v Speaker 19>and explorers and so of course,</v>
<v Speaker 19>given the opportunity,</v>

873
00:42:23.181 --> 00:42:25.040
<v Speaker 19>that's pretty much what I'm doing on the</v>
<v Speaker 19>show.</v>

874
00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:26.453
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a crazy change of life at 44 years </v>

875
00:42:28.441 --> 00:42:30.150
<v Speaker 2>of age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much did you travel before then?</v>

876
00:42:30.580 --> 00:42:31.450
<v Speaker 19>Almost nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 19>I mean,</v>

877
00:42:31.451 --> 00:42:34.270
<v Speaker 19>I'd been to France a couple of summers </v>
<v Speaker 19>as a kid,</v>

878
00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:37.450
<v Speaker 19>a bit to the Caribbean.</v>
<v Speaker 19>That was about it.</v>

879
00:42:37.470 --> 00:42:37.940
<v Speaker 19>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 19>I,</v>

880
00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:41.920
<v Speaker 19>I was always sure of anything at age 44 </v>
<v Speaker 19>standing in the kitchen.</v>

881
00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:45.170
<v Speaker 19>It was that I'd never see,</v>
<v Speaker 19>you know,</v>

882
00:42:46.330 --> 00:42:48.370
<v Speaker 19>Saigon or,</v>
<v Speaker 19>or Hong Kong,</v>

883
00:42:48.371 --> 00:42:49.450
<v Speaker 19>much less,</v>
<v Speaker 19>you know,</v>

884
00:42:49.451 --> 00:42:52.300
<v Speaker 19>I probably had no expectation I'd ever </v>
<v Speaker 19>see Rome,</v>

885
00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:54.100
<v Speaker 19>so I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 19>again,</v>

886
00:42:54.101 --> 00:42:58.270
<v Speaker 19>I'm just kind of living that out and,</v>
<v Speaker 19>and as long as me and the crew,</v>

887
00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:00.760
<v Speaker 19>as long as we're having as much fun as </v>
<v Speaker 19>we are,</v>

888
00:43:00.761 --> 00:43:04.930
<v Speaker 19>at least finding ways to make like more </v>
<v Speaker 19>and more fucked up television.</v>

889
00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:06.760
<v Speaker 19>As long as we can do that.</v>
