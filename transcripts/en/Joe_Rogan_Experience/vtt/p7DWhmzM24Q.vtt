00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:03.000
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.690
<v Speaker 1>It just doesn't seem like a huge product gets everybody gets their phone ruined</v>

3
00:00:06.691 --> 00:00:08.100
<v Speaker 1>by pouring a drink on it.</v>

4
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.250
<v Speaker 1>Like that's the number one reason phones get ruined.</v>

5
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.210
<v Speaker 1>I would say cracked screens.</v>

6
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:12.840
<v Speaker 1>Toilet.</v>

7
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:13.621
<v Speaker 1>I will take cracked.</v>

8
00:00:13.621 --> 00:00:15.660
<v Speaker 1>Screens are probably higher than water,</v>

9
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:16.643
<v Speaker 1>but they're both high.</v>

10
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.630
<v Speaker 1>Speaking of cracked screens,</v>

11
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:19.650
<v Speaker 1>cracked screens.</v>

12
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:20.401
<v Speaker 1>Almost universal.</v>

13
00:00:20.401 --> 00:00:20.750
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

14
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.320
<v Speaker 1>Does everybody get a cracked screen?</v>

15
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.250
<v Speaker 1>I've never had one,</v>

16
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.640
<v Speaker 1>but I've had to move a Turd to get my phone out of.</v>

17
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:26.723
<v Speaker 1>Out of the toilet.</v>

18
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.450
<v Speaker 1>Did you kill the phone or the phone?</v>

19
00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:29.260
<v Speaker 1>Survive.</v>

20
00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:30.060
<v Speaker 1>Survive.</v>

21
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.310
<v Speaker 1>How long was it in English?</v>

22
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.290
<v Speaker 1>It literally like I got up and then it fell in the toilet and I was like God put</v>

23
00:00:37.291 --> 00:00:38.930
<v Speaker 1>my hand through her and grabbed it,</v>

24
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.560
<v Speaker 1>pulled it out and then.</v>

25
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.970
<v Speaker 1>And then just write it off.</v>

26
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.320
<v Speaker 1>Put it in a bag of right now.</v>

27
00:00:44.321 --> 00:00:45.940
<v Speaker 1>It didn't even wash his hands as far.</v>

28
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.130
<v Speaker 1>Now I did the shaky thing and the good enough hairdryer.</v>

29
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:51.030
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

30
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.720
<v Speaker 1>What you should do if that happens is 24 hours in a bag of rice.</v>

31
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

32
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.870
<v Speaker 1>it'll.</v>

33
00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.510
<v Speaker 1>It'll pull away moisture.</v>

34
00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.830
<v Speaker 1>What I usually end up just doing,</v>

35
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.090
<v Speaker 1>then having something stopped working and then take it to the APP or call the</v>

36
00:01:03.091 --> 00:01:05.650
<v Speaker 1>apple store and they will send you one with that.</v>

37
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:06.900
<v Speaker 1>Apple's great with that.</v>

38
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:08.460
<v Speaker 1>Here's the weird thing though.</v>

39
00:01:08.461 --> 00:01:09.060
<v Speaker 1>They put,</v>

40
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.990
<v Speaker 1>or at least they used to.</v>

41
00:01:09.991 --> 00:01:10.591
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anymore.</v>

42
00:01:10.591 --> 00:01:12.990
<v Speaker 1>I used to do some repairs on these things,</v>

43
00:01:12.991 --> 00:01:14.670
<v Speaker 1>crack them open and get crazy like that,</v>

44
00:01:14.671 --> 00:01:18.030
<v Speaker 1>but they used to put little litmus paper in there that would show.</v>

45
00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.810
<v Speaker 1>Got Wet.</v>

46
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:19.680
<v Speaker 1>It would turn red.</v>

47
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.000
<v Speaker 1>He used to be in the headphone Jack.</v>

48
00:01:21.001 --> 00:01:21.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

49
00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:22.650
<v Speaker 1>They probably still do it.</v>

50
00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:23.510
<v Speaker 1>Still do it,</v>

51
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.910
<v Speaker 1>but that.</v>

52
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.440
<v Speaker 1>But if you call they don't.</v>

53
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.190
<v Speaker 1>There's no way from their check when I say,</v>

54
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.990
<v Speaker 1>here's a question,</v>

55
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.350
<v Speaker 1>when you say if you drop something in the toilet,</v>

56
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.230
<v Speaker 1>drop upon the children,</v>

57
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.540
<v Speaker 1>should you shut it off and throw it in the bag of rice?</v>

58
00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.840
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

59
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.150
<v Speaker 1>should you leave time to turns itself off,</v>

60
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.631
<v Speaker 1>but it.</v>

61
00:01:36.631 --> 00:01:36.781
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

62
00:01:36.781 --> 00:01:37.081
<v Speaker 1>If you.</v>

63
00:01:37.081 --> 00:01:37.890
<v Speaker 1>If it's still on,</v>

64
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:38.220
<v Speaker 1>turn it,</v>

65
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.053
<v Speaker 1>turn it off.</v>

66
00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.903
<v Speaker 1>Shut it off.</v>

67
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:40.860
<v Speaker 1>So shut it off.</v>

68
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.300
<v Speaker 1>Throw it in the bag of rice.</v>

69
00:01:42.301 --> 00:01:43.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

70
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.570
<v Speaker 1>What I usually do is just suck the water out of it,</v>

71
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:47.160
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

72
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.760
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

73
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:48.001
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

74
00:01:48.001 --> 00:01:49.700
<v Speaker 1>but I wasn't going to do it with the poop ones.</v>

75
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:51.203
<v Speaker 1>Why not?</v>

76
00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:54.870
<v Speaker 1>Because when you suck it off,</v>

77
00:01:54.871 --> 00:01:55.800
<v Speaker 1>if you look at your iphone,</v>

78
00:01:55.801 --> 00:01:57.960
<v Speaker 1>like there's the top part where the.</v>

79
00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.420
<v Speaker 1>That's where your ear usually goes,</v>

80
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.010
<v Speaker 1>but there's water that's in there.</v>

81
00:02:02.011 --> 00:02:05.010
<v Speaker 1>So you stuck that and you're like pretty much sucking earwax.</v>

82
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.873
<v Speaker 1>It's gross.</v>

83
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.630
<v Speaker 1>I never,</v>

84
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.730
<v Speaker 1>I never thought of talking on my phone.</v>

85
00:02:08.731 --> 00:02:09.890
<v Speaker 1>Ever been to that.</v>

86
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.780
<v Speaker 1>You mean like I go really hard many times.</v>

87
00:02:12.781 --> 00:02:13.500
<v Speaker 1>Have you done this?</v>

88
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.610
<v Speaker 1>Probably like five times.</v>

89
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.830
<v Speaker 1>So where's your fault when</v>

90
00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.480
<v Speaker 1>you're going that you're getting earwax.</v>

91
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:20.460
<v Speaker 1>If you look,</v>

92
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.941
<v Speaker 1>if you look,</v>

93
00:02:20.941 --> 00:02:24.330
<v Speaker 1>there's like a little grill that's right there and if you look really close you</v>

94
00:02:24.331 --> 00:02:25.770
<v Speaker 1>could actually see their shit in there.</v>

95
00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.020
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about the Jack itself,</v>

96
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.150
<v Speaker 1>but you have to suck all of them.</v>

97
00:02:30.151 --> 00:02:31.860
<v Speaker 1>There's the bottom one that you suck.</v>

98
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.000
<v Speaker 1>You suck like power.</v>

99
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.350
<v Speaker 1>Does that work?</v>

100
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:35.760
<v Speaker 1>Can you really suck the water out?</v>

101
00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:36.510
<v Speaker 1>Will really help.</v>

102
00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:37.320
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'll always do.</v>

103
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.490
<v Speaker 1>You mean getting,</v>

104
00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:41.790
<v Speaker 1>getting water away from it is going to be a positive thing,</v>

105
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:43.283
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

106
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.240
<v Speaker 1>the guy on the phone,</v>

107
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.380
<v Speaker 1>customer service here,</v>

108
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.883
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

109
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.960
<v Speaker 1>I've been sucking on my phones that cool.</v>

110
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying in the most polite way possible.</v>

111
00:02:54.901 --> 00:02:55.770
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't recommend it.</v>

112
00:02:55.771 --> 00:02:56.060
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

113
00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.221
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

114
00:02:56.221 --> 00:03:00.020
<v Speaker 1>and that's a problem because we have capitalized and privatized the</v>

115
00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.050
<v Speaker 2>education system to hear such a degree.</v>

116
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:03.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you.</v>

117
00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.810
<v Speaker 2>If you got a degree in Australia where rights,</v>

118
00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.350
<v Speaker 2>Macquarie University or Sydney University or University of New South Wales,</v>

119
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.170
<v Speaker 2>it's an Mba.</v>

120
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.551
<v Speaker 2>One of us.</v>

121
00:03:10.551 --> 00:03:13.750
<v Speaker 2>Google's is exactly same as an mba at any one of our schools here.</v>

122
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.190
<v Speaker 2>You know you had not only does an MBA matter that all of a sudden and it has to</v>

123
00:03:18.191 --> 00:03:19.190
<v Speaker 2>be from the right school,</v>

124
00:03:19.191 --> 00:03:23.980
<v Speaker 2>so an Mba from Harvard or an Ivy League school is trump's and mba from</v>

125
00:03:23.981 --> 00:03:27.910
<v Speaker 2>university of San Diego or something like that and that shouldn't be the way and</v>

126
00:03:27.911 --> 00:03:28.810
<v Speaker 2>affect what that does.</v>

127
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.220
<v Speaker 2>It still keeps propelling that plutocracy because there was a study done that at</v>

128
00:03:33.221 --> 00:03:35.560
<v Speaker 2>least for every student at Harvard,</v>

129
00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.870
<v Speaker 2>a student and have.</v>

130
00:03:36.871 --> 00:03:40.450
<v Speaker 2>It has at least one parent earning at least for $100,000 per year.</v>

131
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.320
<v Speaker 2>So we're still,</v>

132
00:03:42.321 --> 00:03:42.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

133
00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.470
<v Speaker 2>with the capitalization of everything.</v>

134
00:03:44.471 --> 00:03:44.781
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>

135
00:03:44.781 --> 00:03:46.330
<v Speaker 2>we're forming a system where we have,</v>

136
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.871
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

137
00:03:46.871 --> 00:03:49.630
<v Speaker 2>the very wealthy at the top and we have everybody's struggling in the bottom</v>

138
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.760
<v Speaker 3>that the elite ism involved in education is really fascinating to me today.</v>

139
00:03:54.761 --> 00:03:57.160
<v Speaker 3>Especially because there's so much access to information,</v>

140
00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:58.270
<v Speaker 3>so many books,</v>

141
00:03:58.271 --> 00:03:59.320
<v Speaker 3>so much online,</v>

142
00:03:59.321 --> 00:04:04.321
<v Speaker 3>so much to read and just you can get so much access to information that would,</v>

143
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.961
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

144
00:04:04.961 --> 00:04:05.860
<v Speaker 3>a long time ago.</v>

145
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.370
<v Speaker 3>The difference between going to Harvard and go into San Diego state was pretty</v>

146
00:04:09.371 --> 00:04:10.204
<v Speaker 3>gigantic.</v>

147
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.180
<v Speaker 3>But what with what you have access to today,</v>

148
00:04:13.181 --> 00:04:17.350
<v Speaker 3>the average person has access to the exact same information that they're</v>

149
00:04:17.351 --> 00:04:19.630
<v Speaker 3>teaching at any school anywhere.</v>

150
00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:24.040
<v Speaker 3>But I had a conversation with a friend of mine and he was wrong about something</v>

151
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.340
<v Speaker 3>and I brought up this woman who had.</v>

152
00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.100
<v Speaker 3>She had went to the University of Mississippi,</v>

153
00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.250
<v Speaker 3>but she went there and this was her major.</v>

154
00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.320
<v Speaker 3>Like this thing that we were talking about.</v>

155
00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.891
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

156
00:04:35.891 --> 00:04:36.041
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

157
00:04:36.041 --> 00:04:37.240
<v Speaker 3>this guy went to Yale.</v>

158
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.550
<v Speaker 3>But he didn't even go to jail for that.</v>

159
00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.980
<v Speaker 3>He went to jail for something else and he's 80.</v>

160
00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:42.551
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

161
00:04:42.551 --> 00:04:45.010
<v Speaker 3>So he went to Yale and like the 19 sixties,</v>

162
00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.410
<v Speaker 3>who knows what the fuck they were teaching back then.</v>

163
00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.090
<v Speaker 3>Like what are you talking about man,</v>

164
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

165
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.920
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

166
00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:50.600
<v Speaker 3>but the eye,</v>

167
00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.750
<v Speaker 3>his first initial reaction was,</v>

168
00:04:52.751 --> 00:04:52.961
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

169
00:04:52.961 --> 00:04:54.490
<v Speaker 3>she went to the University of Mississippi,</v>

170
00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:55.620
<v Speaker 3>he went to Yale.</v>

171
00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:56.200
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

172
00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.351
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

173
00:04:56.351 --> 00:04:57.490
<v Speaker 3>that's hilarious.</v>

174
00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.740
<v Speaker 3>But that is the way we think in this country</v>

175
00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.411
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

176
00:05:00.411 --> 00:05:02.120
<v Speaker 2>And also not only is it the way we think,</v>

177
00:05:02.121 --> 00:05:02.850
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

178
00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:05.660
<v Speaker 2>these kids that are going to mit or harvard or Yale,</v>

179
00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.820
<v Speaker 2>well it's the networks I take with them.</v>

180
00:05:07.821 --> 00:05:09.140
<v Speaker 2>So when the jobs are about,</v>

181
00:05:09.141 --> 00:05:09.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

182
00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.400
<v Speaker 2>the only growth area that we have in this country as a technology jokes.</v>

183
00:05:13.401 --> 00:05:17.570
<v Speaker 2>But that's such an inshallah job market where only the networks,</v>

184
00:05:17.571 --> 00:05:21.170
<v Speaker 2>the alumni from these prestigious schools get to really apply from all the kids</v>

185
00:05:21.171 --> 00:05:22.130
<v Speaker 2>working at Google.</v>

186
00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.430
<v Speaker 2>They all went to these fancy schools that could be afforded by the wealthy</v>

187
00:05:25.431 --> 00:05:26.264
<v Speaker 2>parents.</v>

188
00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:28.730
<v Speaker 4>Collin quit a long time ago reminded me many,</v>

189
00:05:28.731 --> 00:05:29.200
<v Speaker 4>many years.</v>

190
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.661
<v Speaker 4>My first,</v>

191
00:05:29.661 --> 00:05:30.260
<v Speaker 4>like on an opiod,</v>

192
00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.471
<v Speaker 4>anthony,</v>

193
00:05:30.471 --> 00:05:33.230
<v Speaker 4>I was dating a British girl and she was a real pervert,</v>

194
00:05:33.231 --> 00:05:36.200
<v Speaker 4>like I drove a Saturn back then I still lived in Jersey and I used to fucking</v>

195
00:05:36.201 --> 00:05:39.110
<v Speaker 4>park outside of Dangerfield and she would blow me.</v>

196
00:05:39.111 --> 00:05:39.681
<v Speaker 4>I would trap.</v>

197
00:05:39.681 --> 00:05:40.011
<v Speaker 4>She liked,</v>

198
00:05:40.011 --> 00:05:42.980
<v Speaker 4>been to trap her head under my steering wheel and she would go like,</v>

199
00:05:42.981 --> 00:05:44.090
<v Speaker 4>I want you to bite me,</v>

200
00:05:44.091 --> 00:05:45.170
<v Speaker 4>I want you to bite me.</v>

201
00:05:45.171 --> 00:05:50.030
<v Speaker 4>Like she would repeat this mantra of me biting her on her back.</v>

202
00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:53.780
<v Speaker 4>She liked to be bitten and brutalized by her back and she was like,</v>

203
00:05:53.781 --> 00:05:55.040
<v Speaker 4>I want you to make me suck it,</v>

204
00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:58.820
<v Speaker 4>and then I would hold her head under the wheel and she'll be trapped under my</v>

205
00:05:58.821 --> 00:05:59.920
<v Speaker 4>Saturday steering wheel</v>

206
00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:05.110
<v Speaker 4>and fucking she would suck my dick and lick my balls and whatever.</v>

207
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:05.910
<v Speaker 4>Good kid.</v>

208
00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:06.651
<v Speaker 4>He was a good girl.</v>

209
00:06:06.651 --> 00:06:06.831
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

210
00:06:06.831 --> 00:06:07.520
<v Speaker 4>Her name is ruth.</v>

211
00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.750
<v Speaker 4>She was a really cool girl.</v>

212
00:06:08.751 --> 00:06:09.170
<v Speaker 4>Ruth.</v>

213
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:09.411
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

214
00:06:09.411 --> 00:06:10.820
<v Speaker 4>Good five and talked to her in 15 years,</v>

215
00:06:10.821 --> 00:06:12.220
<v Speaker 4>but she was a great guy.</v>

216
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:13.063
<v Speaker 4>Mr. Terribly.</v>

217
00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.830
<v Speaker 4>I think you went back across the pond.</v>

218
00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:16.640
<v Speaker 4>Hello?</v>

219
00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:17.430
<v Speaker 4>As they say.</v>

220
00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:19.900
<v Speaker 4>And what was the point of the story of the Colon?</v>

221
00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:22.280
<v Speaker 4>She was really loud when I ate her pussy.</v>

222
00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:24.560
<v Speaker 4>Really super loud.</v>

223
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:25.210
<v Speaker 4>And it was,</v>

224
00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:25.970
<v Speaker 4>she say,</v>

225
00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:26.470
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember.</v>

226
00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:27.410
<v Speaker 4>Just moaning and groaning.</v>

227
00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:30.530
<v Speaker 4>One of those things.</v>

228
00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:31.463
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

229
00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:33.153
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

230
00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.000
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

231
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:34.530
<v Speaker 4>Whatever it was.</v>

232
00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:35.363
<v Speaker 4>I</v>

233
00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.930
<v Speaker 4>beat my pussy like it's Manchester United,</v>

234
00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:46.130
<v Speaker 4>but I can't.</v>

235
00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:49.790
<v Speaker 4>It was a really low and puts you a sloppy fucking wet.</v>

236
00:06:49.791 --> 00:06:50.690
<v Speaker 4>Like it was legit.</v>

237
00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:54.950
<v Speaker 4>Like I knew she wasn't putting on a show because her pussy was sloppy,</v>

238
00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.370
<v Speaker 4>but I was going to eat her pussy on the air be a year.</v>

239
00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:00.320
<v Speaker 4>This is before I was I get everyday and be a good quality and your pussy on the</v>

240
00:07:00.321 --> 00:07:01.760
<v Speaker 4>air and I was going to do that.</v>

241
00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:03.980
<v Speaker 4>And Collin Quinn stopped me and he goes,</v>

242
00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:04.760
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

243
00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:05.331
<v Speaker 4>and he goes,</v>

244
00:07:05.331 --> 00:07:06.170
<v Speaker 4>you can do that.</v>

245
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:06.921
<v Speaker 4>You could put them in.</v>

246
00:07:06.921 --> 00:07:07.521
<v Speaker 4>You're a comic.</v>

247
00:07:07.521 --> 00:07:08.660
<v Speaker 4>You got to say funny shit.</v>

248
00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:11.870
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to be that guy that does wacky things.</v>

249
00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:12.351
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>

250
00:07:12.351 --> 00:07:13.460
<v Speaker 4>I never forgot that.</v>

251
00:07:13.461 --> 00:07:14.181
<v Speaker 4>He was almost telling me,</v>

252
00:07:14.181 --> 00:07:15.470
<v Speaker 4>don't be a stunt boy.</v>

253
00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:17.420
<v Speaker 4>You gotta say it funny.</v>

254
00:07:17.421 --> 00:07:22.400
<v Speaker 4>You got to sit there and be funny verbally and I maybe in that case he was right</v>

255
00:07:22.401 --> 00:07:23.181
<v Speaker 4>because I wasn't the gun,</v>

256
00:07:23.181 --> 00:07:25.460
<v Speaker 4>the Wacko who call up at eight pussy on the air.</v>

257
00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:29.290
<v Speaker 4>It's like I have to be able to be funny in my delivery and say,</v>

258
00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:29.630
<v Speaker 4>and I was like,</v>

259
00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:30.061
<v Speaker 4>eh.</v>

260
00:07:30.061 --> 00:07:31.340
<v Speaker 4>That was kind of a good point.</v>

261
00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:32.570
<v Speaker 4>Looking back in hindsight,</v>

262
00:07:32.571 --> 00:07:34.970
<v Speaker 4>I probably should have eaten or pussy on the going to be a very funny clip.</v>
