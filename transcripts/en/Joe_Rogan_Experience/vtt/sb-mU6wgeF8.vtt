<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

8
00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:18.460
<v Speaker 1>I've been a fan of your music for a long</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

9
00:00:18.461 --> 00:00:21.370
<v Speaker 1>so it's Kinda cool to see you in person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've worked out conversely,</v>

10
00:00:21.371 --> 00:00:24.880
<v Speaker 1>so it's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>

11
00:00:24.881 --> 00:00:26.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean to just jump right into </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

12
00:00:26.591 --> 00:00:29.950
<v Speaker 1>but it kind of freaked me out that your </v>
<v Speaker 1>have involvement in pro wrestling.</v>

13
00:00:29.951 --> 00:00:31.270
<v Speaker 1>The own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The NWA.</v>

14
00:00:31.271 --> 00:00:31.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

15
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.910
<v Speaker 2>The national wrestling alliance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the oldest brand in the world I was </v>

16
00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.620
<v Speaker 2>working for TNA was president for a hot </v>
<v Speaker 2>second.</v>

17
00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.870
<v Speaker 2>Then I got fired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you were President of TNA.</v>

18
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:42.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

19
00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.410
<v Speaker 2>that's a crazy story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how much you want to get </v>

20
00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.410
<v Speaker 2>into that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

21
00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dixie Carter own TNA.</v>

22
00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.790
<v Speaker 2>I knew her through the years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to go to shows and stuff like </v>

23
00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.551
<v Speaker 2>that and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and at some point they approached me </v>

24
00:00:57.551 --> 00:00:58.940
<v Speaker 2>about investing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said No.</v>

25
00:00:58.941 --> 00:01:01.310
<v Speaker 2>Then they offered me a job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started working for the company.</v>

26
00:01:01.311 --> 00:01:03.200
<v Speaker 2>Then they would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have started having money problems.</v>

27
00:01:03.201 --> 00:01:05.990
<v Speaker 2>They started putting money in and </v>
<v Speaker 2>through the contrivance of all that,</v>

28
00:01:05.991 --> 00:01:08.990
<v Speaker 2>then I started getting more power in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>company and putting in more money.</v>

29
00:01:08.991 --> 00:01:10.070
<v Speaker 2>So then it became like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

30
00:01:10.071 --> 00:01:12.680
<v Speaker 2>if I'm going to put in all this money </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm going to have all this power,</v>

31
00:01:12.681 --> 00:01:13.700
<v Speaker 2>I want to run the show.</v>

32
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.210
<v Speaker 2>They basically said that was cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the minute I had the spot,</v>

33
00:01:17.211 --> 00:01:18.290
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>game of thrones.</v>

34
00:01:18.291 --> 00:01:21.280
<v Speaker 2>They all started trying to kill me off </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>

35
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrestling's weird because you have this </v>

36
00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.360
<v Speaker 2>weird mix of reality and fantasy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard sometimes to know where one </v>

37
00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.460
<v Speaker 2>thing and the fans get into both the </v>
<v Speaker 2>behind the scenes and the fantasy.</v>

38
00:01:31.461 --> 00:01:33.680
<v Speaker 2>So no one's quite sure sometimes where </v>
<v Speaker 2>the blur is.</v>

39
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.040
<v Speaker 2>And he had got pretty crazy for a while.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lawsuit.</v>

40
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm a real lawsuit sued.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sued,</v>

41
00:01:40.461 --> 00:01:43.610
<v Speaker 2>and this is a quick funny thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

42
00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.060
<v Speaker 2>people continually write that I lost the</v>
<v Speaker 2>lawsuit.</v>

43
00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.070
<v Speaker 2>I never lost the lawsuit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lost one of the motions which led to </v>

44
00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.920
<v Speaker 2>them mean negotiating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we settled out of court.</v>

45
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.650
<v Speaker 2>But the judge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the contract that they signed,</v>

46
00:01:56.651 --> 00:01:58.910
<v Speaker 2>that would have allowed me to take over </v>
<v Speaker 2>the company under the,</v>

47
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
<v Speaker 2>under the motion that I had filed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the judge basically dismissed my motion </v>

48
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.420
<v Speaker 2>because the contract they had signed </v>
<v Speaker 2>with me was illegal under Tennessee law </v>

49
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
<v Speaker 2>even though a Tennessee lawyer had </v>
<v Speaker 2>negotiated on the company's behalf and </v>

50
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.000
<v Speaker 2>signed it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

51
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.710
<v Speaker 1>That sounds like some double cross </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestling type guy.</v>

52
00:02:19.711 --> 00:02:20.310
<v Speaker 1>So it'd be like</v>

53
00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.840
<v Speaker 2>you did a contract with me and then I </v>
<v Speaker 2>sued you.</v>

54
00:02:23.841 --> 00:02:25.250
<v Speaker 2>And then the judge says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

55
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.230
<v Speaker 2>even though Joe had a California lawyer </v>
<v Speaker 2>sign,</v>

56
00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:31.310
<v Speaker 2>it's illegal under California law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So therefore the contracts meaningless.</v>

57
00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.590
<v Speaker 1>It was bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does one go from smashing pumpkins </v>

58
00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.390
<v Speaker 1>pro wrestling and then go so deep that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like an owner?</v>

59
00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

60
00:02:40.941 --> 00:02:45.941
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty wild and unexpected for a </v>

61
00:02:45.941 --> 00:02:46.180
<v Speaker 1>lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

62
00:02:46.181 --> 00:02:46.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

63
00:02:46.541 --> 00:02:47.530
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get that a lot.</v>

64
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.060
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've learned and I've actually,</v>

65
00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.150
<v Speaker 1>I've actually learned over time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just best to keep the world </v>

66
00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.680
<v Speaker 1>separate because the music fans don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to hear anything about the </v>

67
00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.680
<v Speaker 1>wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

68
00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.910
<v Speaker 1>they just don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just,</v>

69
00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.440
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get the a that I'm a bit goofy,</v>

70
00:02:59.441 --> 00:03:02.050
<v Speaker 1>but they just don't want to hear about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the wrestling thing they asked.</v>

71
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.550
<v Speaker 1>They asked the worlds to be kept </v>
<v Speaker 1>separate.</v>

72
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.140
<v Speaker 1>Did they ever get mad at you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

73
00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

74
00:03:07.841 --> 00:03:10.030
<v Speaker 1>and you can appreciate that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It kills the gimmick.</v>

75
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.120
<v Speaker 1>They want me to be this gothic vampire </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy or whatever,</v>

76
00:03:13.121 --> 00:03:13.710
<v Speaker 1>and then it's like.</v>

77
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.040
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there's pro wrestling.</v>

78
00:03:15.041 --> 00:03:17.200
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just totally kills the gimmick.</v>

79
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.230
<v Speaker 1>It's really funny though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's awesome.</v>

80
00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.590
<v Speaker 1>I love it when people just get into what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they like.</v>

81
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.900
<v Speaker 1>Well that's something I appreciate about</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

82
00:03:25.901 --> 00:03:27.910
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I've watched where you guys go deep</v>

83
00:03:27.911 --> 00:03:29.650
<v Speaker 1>dives and mma and other things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

84
00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.540
<v Speaker 1>I think it's cool to have multiple </v>
<v Speaker 1>interests.</v>

85
00:03:31.541 --> 00:03:33.970
<v Speaker 1>I at the renaissance man thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

86
00:03:33.971 --> 00:03:38.971
<v Speaker 1>Well I think for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for some reason people shy away from </v>

87
00:03:38.971 --> 00:03:39.310
<v Speaker 1>them because they think folks are going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be confused.</v>

88
00:03:39.311 --> 00:03:40.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

89
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.250
<v Speaker 1>Good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>

90
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:43.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

91
00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.410
<v Speaker 1>I'd grown up in Chicago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a really rich wrestling </v>

92
00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.410
<v Speaker 1>history in Chicago growing up and my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

93
00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.090
<v Speaker 1>my great grandmother watch wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was like I grew up in,</v>

94
00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.900
<v Speaker 1>at four years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm watching Dick,</v>

95
00:03:52.901 --> 00:03:57.901
<v Speaker 1>the bruiser on television and this was </v>
<v Speaker 1>also the era of hockey fights and I'm </v>

96
00:03:57.901 --> 00:03:58.360
<v Speaker 1>roller derby.</v>

97
00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:59.800
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>road debbie.</v>

98
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.810
<v Speaker 1>So we'd watch hockey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pro wrestling,</v>

99
00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was in the family and then later I </v>

100
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.910
<v Speaker 1>found out that my other great </v>
<v Speaker 1>grandmother also watch wrestling,</v>

101
00:04:06.911 --> 00:04:11.911
<v Speaker 1>so both sides of the family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both her great grandmother sweatshirt </v>

102
00:04:11.911 --> 00:04:12.280
<v Speaker 1>wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's just in the blood I guess.</v>

103
00:04:12.281 --> 00:04:14.020
<v Speaker 1>We liked that we liked the car and have </v>
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>

104
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.330
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm always amazed at Roller Derby.</v>

105
00:04:16.331 --> 00:04:18.670
<v Speaker 1>I've never made like a serious comeback.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They tried,</v>

106
00:04:18.671 --> 00:04:20.030
<v Speaker 1>they kind of did the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

107
00:04:20.031 --> 00:04:23.710
<v Speaker 1>the tattooed girl's doing roller Derby </v>
<v Speaker 1>hipstery type thing.</v>

108
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.600
<v Speaker 1>It had a moment there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

109
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.170
<v Speaker 1>I know I had a friend who was into it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and she was that type.</v>

110
00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:34.630
<v Speaker 1>I just thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that seems like something that </v>

111
00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:34.630
<v Speaker 1>would catch on today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

112
00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.190
<v Speaker 1>They transitioned from like Roller Derby</v>
<v Speaker 1>to suicide girls.</v>

113
00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like to get a little hotter,</v>

114
00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:44.390
<v Speaker 1>that girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can be thick and be a roller derby </v>

115
00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.390
<v Speaker 1>girl.</v>

116
00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:45.200
<v Speaker 1>You could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could eat all the carbs you liked,</v>

117
00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:47.350
<v Speaker 1>but didn't roller derby back in the day </v>
<v Speaker 1>was huge.</v>

118
00:04:47.351 --> 00:04:52.351
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they were doing like packed </v>

119
00:04:52.351 --> 00:04:52.351
<v Speaker 1>arenas and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

120
00:04:52.351 --> 00:04:52.351
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fun to watch.</v>

121
00:04:52.351 --> 00:04:52.720
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

122
00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.270
<v Speaker 1>I only see him go after each other and </v>
<v Speaker 1>skating around.</v>

123
00:04:55.271 --> 00:04:56.520
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fun.</v>

124
00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.550
<v Speaker 1>It's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like racing plus fighting and hip </v>

125
00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:02.340
<v Speaker 1>checking each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

126
00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.540
<v Speaker 1>it's early days memory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I remember thinking,</v>

127
00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:09.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something sort of hot about the </v>

128
00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:09.880
<v Speaker 1>whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think especially in Chicago,</v>

129
00:05:09.881 --> 00:05:12.060
<v Speaker 1>the women's Roller Derby was bigger than</v>
<v Speaker 1>the men's,</v>

130
00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:13.390
<v Speaker 1>so that says something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

131
00:05:13.391 --> 00:05:15.190
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even know there was men's </v>
<v Speaker 1>roller derby,</v>

132
00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.010
<v Speaker 1>like thinking of men's Roller Derby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

133
00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:22.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm completely drawing a blank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always associated it with like tough </v>

134
00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.060
<v Speaker 1>women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

135
00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm saying.</v>

136
00:05:22.361 --> 00:05:27.361
<v Speaker 1>I think the women's thing actually had </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of staying power where the </v>

137
00:05:27.361 --> 00:05:27.950
<v Speaker 1>men's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it didn't have the same alert or</v>

138
00:05:27.951 --> 00:05:29.200
<v Speaker 1>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

139
00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:30.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>

140
00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:31.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

141
00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.010
<v Speaker 1>you're my age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You remember killer Kowalski Course?</v>

142
00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:39.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember watching that when I was a </v>

143
00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:40.570
<v Speaker 1>kid in Boston watching it on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on regular tv,</v>

144
00:05:40.571 --> 00:05:42.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that those guys were great.</v>

145
00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a golden age.</v>

146
00:05:45.221 --> 00:05:47.740
<v Speaker 1>It's like anything you can go back and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of romanticize it.</v>

147
00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.450
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's part of what we're trying</v>

148
00:05:49.451 --> 00:05:51.610
<v Speaker 1>to do is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the cool thing about the nw is we</v>

149
00:05:51.611 --> 00:05:56.611
<v Speaker 1>actually possess that history and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so our job is to sort of update it,</v>

150
00:05:57.531 --> 00:05:58.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to bring</v>

151
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:03.160
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to bring that tough guy thing back into </v>

152
00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:03.920
<v Speaker 2>the modern world in a way that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>insult the audience's intelligence.</v>

153
00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:08.870
<v Speaker 2>So the Nwa is that older than the wwe I </v>
<v Speaker 2>1948 is the Nwa.</v>

154
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:15.430
<v Speaker 2>And the cool thing about the end was </v>
<v Speaker 2>history was you had all these rival </v>

155
00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:19.961
<v Speaker 2>promoters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including the mcmahons in the northeast </v>

156
00:06:19.961 --> 00:06:22.211
<v Speaker 2>that eventually sort of formed a kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>ad hoc association to create a better </v>

157
00:06:22.701 --> 00:06:24.980
<v Speaker 2>business in essence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get everybody on the same page.</v>

158
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.280
<v Speaker 2>And what they would do is they named one</v>
<v Speaker 2>champion the champion,</v>

159
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.240
<v Speaker 2>rotate through the different </v>
<v Speaker 2>territories,</v>

160
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:32.720
<v Speaker 2>come in and take on the whoever was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>local guy,</v>

161
00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:37.930
<v Speaker 2>they build up the local guy and then a </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy like rick flair would come in and </v>

162
00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:39.260
<v Speaker 2>beat the local guy and it would always </v>
<v Speaker 2>be like a bit of a scrum.</v>

163
00:06:39.261 --> 00:06:44.261
<v Speaker 2>And then he'd come back for a second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there would be a cage match and then </v>

164
00:06:44.261 --> 00:06:44.261
<v Speaker 2>rick flair would move onto the next </v>
<v Speaker 2>territory.</v>

165
00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:46.760
<v Speaker 2>And that's how those guys rotate around </v>
<v Speaker 2>and everybody made more money.</v>

166
00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:52.300
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the government got involved at </v>

167
00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:52.300
<v Speaker 2>different points because there was </v>
<v Speaker 2>collusion.</v>

168
00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:53.480
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's ric flair with our belt.</v>

169
00:06:53.481 --> 00:06:55.800
<v Speaker 2>Actually I follow him on instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

170
00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:57.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean Rick,</v>

171
00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:00.820
<v Speaker 2>Rick's rick in a dusty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dusty Rhodes,</v>

172
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:04.610
<v Speaker 2>or are probably the two most prominent </v>
<v Speaker 2>chance that the Nwa had.</v>

173
00:07:04.611 --> 00:07:08.810
<v Speaker 2>So just to be the owner of that history </v>
<v Speaker 2>is so humbling for me as a fan.</v>

174
00:07:08.811 --> 00:07:09.530
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

175
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:11.150
<v Speaker 2>that is so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

176
00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:13.250
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty wild actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

177
00:07:13.251 --> 00:07:18.251
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's quite a character and still is </v>

178
00:07:18.251 --> 00:07:18.251
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even on instagram stories,</v>

179
00:07:18.251 --> 00:07:20.610
<v Speaker 2>stories are legendary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stories are absolutely wondering,</v>

180
00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:25.660
<v Speaker 2>30 for 30 just came out about them and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm hearing it's like one of the best </v>

181
00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:25.760
<v Speaker 2>ones ever made.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just the day to day,</v>

182
00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.470
<v Speaker 2>maybe two days ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh cool.</v>

183
00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:29.720
<v Speaker 2>Then I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not trying to speak for rick,</v>

184
00:07:29.721 --> 00:07:31.200
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

185
00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:36.280
<v Speaker 2>there's an example of somebody where </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like the persona and the real life </v>

186
00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:37.130
<v Speaker 2>person sort of blurred.</v>

187
00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:42.420
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's hard to figure out who was who </v>

188
00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:42.420
<v Speaker 2>at any given time that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the case.</v>

189
00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:44.360
<v Speaker 2>Like dice clay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

190
00:07:44.361 --> 00:07:44.810
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

191
00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:47.030
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He used to be Andrew Silverstein and the</v>

192
00:07:47.031 --> 00:07:50.120
<v Speaker 2>dice man was a character needs to do on </v>
<v Speaker 2>stage as he now is.</v>

193
00:07:50.121 --> 00:07:52.890
<v Speaker 2>He now become 100 percent all Manson's </v>
<v Speaker 2>that my friend had friends,</v>

194
00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:54.170
<v Speaker 2>Marilyn Manson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's the same way.</v>

195
00:07:54.171 --> 00:07:59.171
<v Speaker 2>It's like they become,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they become the gimmick at some point </v>

196
00:07:59.171 --> 00:07:59.540
<v Speaker 2>and sometimes you're not sure who you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking to,</v>

197
00:07:59.541 --> 00:08:04.541
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at some point you also have to </v>

198
00:08:04.541 --> 00:08:06.281
<v Speaker 2>respect that that's so intrinsic to </v>
<v Speaker 2>their world that maybe it's almost </v>

199
00:08:06.281 --> 00:08:07.780
<v Speaker 2>easier just to become the gimmick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

200
00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:11.270
<v Speaker 2>Instead of having to live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to turn it on and off.</v>

201
00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:12.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the other way,</v>

202
00:08:12.501 --> 00:08:17.501
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've gone out of my way to kill the </v>

203
00:08:17.501 --> 00:08:19.271
<v Speaker 2>gimmick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which really it actually hurts business </v>

204
00:08:19.271 --> 00:08:22.240
<v Speaker 2>and people get mad at me because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to know they want the fantasy </v>

205
00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:22.490
<v Speaker 2>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can't live like that.</v>

206
00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:28.060
<v Speaker 2>It's impossible for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they want you to be almost like a </v>

207
00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:28.650
<v Speaker 2>caricature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a Moody Salads,</v>

208
00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:30.520
<v Speaker 2>rumbling a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

209
00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:31.610
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

210
00:08:31.611 --> 00:08:36.611
<v Speaker 2>That's why a lot of this stuff on me </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's clickbait is based on the </v>

211
00:08:36.611 --> 00:08:38.600
<v Speaker 2>character that I both created and people</v>
<v Speaker 2>want me to play.</v>

212
00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:43.900
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like one of the biggest memes of </v>

213
00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:45.581
<v Speaker 2>last year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was about a year ago was like me at </v>

214
00:08:45.581 --> 00:08:45.581
<v Speaker 2>Disneyland.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you've heard about that.</v>

215
00:08:45.581 --> 00:08:49.211
<v Speaker 2>So it's classic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was on a ride and somebody took a </v>

216
00:08:49.211 --> 00:08:53.861
<v Speaker 2>picture of me on the ride and for </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever reason I just don't look happy </v>

217
00:08:53.861 --> 00:08:53.861
<v Speaker 2>at that particular moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I got this great,</v>

218
00:08:53.861 --> 00:08:55.390
<v Speaker 2>this great to infect the guy in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>room.</v>

219
00:08:55.391 --> 00:08:58.860
<v Speaker 2>My tour manager Jug was the guy sitting </v>
<v Speaker 2>next to me in the photo and a.</v>

220
00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:02.550
<v Speaker 2>There you go look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was like massive viral,</v>

221
00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:05.570
<v Speaker 2>like that's perfect.</v>

222
00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.940
<v Speaker 2>And I had a great date,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I met,</v>

223
00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:11.820
<v Speaker 2>I met,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I met tons of fans,</v>

224
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.920
<v Speaker 2>I took pictures with everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love Disneyland.</v>

225
00:09:13.921 --> 00:09:17.190
<v Speaker 2>I had this great day and that became </v>
<v Speaker 2>like this massive thing of like see,</v>

226
00:09:17.191 --> 00:09:20.040
<v Speaker 2>he's miserable even at Disneyland.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>

227
00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:21.570
<v Speaker 2>That's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a perfect picture.</v>

228
00:09:21.571 --> 00:09:21.980
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

229
00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:26.440
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and even ended up on family guy say,</v>

230
00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:28.770
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's very funny man.</v>

231
00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:31.050
<v Speaker 2>That's very funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's got to be exhausting.</v>

232
00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.420
<v Speaker 2>Like having all these expectations that </v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't necessarily,</v>

233
00:09:33.421 --> 00:09:35.610
<v Speaker 2>that don't totally aligned with who you </v>
<v Speaker 2>really are.</v>

234
00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:40.690
<v Speaker 2>A,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it used to be because I felt like I </v>

235
00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:41.220
<v Speaker 2>dunno is the keeper of my image or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

236
00:09:41.221 --> 00:09:46.221
<v Speaker 2>I felt this responsibility to sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>manage it and that's when I just let it </v>

237
00:09:46.221 --> 00:09:46.221
<v Speaker 2>go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

238
00:09:46.221 --> 00:09:47.670
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry to interrupt you,</v>

239
00:09:47.671 --> 00:09:50.610
<v Speaker 2>but it's like at some point I decided </v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy was better for business.</v>

240
00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.400
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm okay with people thinking.</v>

241
00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:52.730
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

242
00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:56.160
<v Speaker 2>it's totally okay because I'm the exact </v>
<v Speaker 2>opposite of nuts.</v>

243
00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:58.560
<v Speaker 2>You have to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're certainly eccentric.</v>

244
00:09:59.160 --> 00:09:59.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's fine.</v>

245
00:09:59.911 --> 00:10:02.010
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I come from a long line of eccentrics.</v>

246
00:10:02.011 --> 00:10:06.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean my father was a drug dealing gun </v>
<v Speaker 2>toting musician.</v>

247
00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:08.180
<v Speaker 2>Was It really madman?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

248
00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:09.780
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Drug dealing.</v>

249
00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:11.160
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What kind of drugs?</v>

250
00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:12.650
<v Speaker 2>You name it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

251
00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:14.250
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

252
00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:17.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a like quick stories.</v>

253
00:10:17.041 --> 00:10:19.740
<v Speaker 2>Like when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my father was a musician,</v>

254
00:10:19.741 --> 00:10:24.741
<v Speaker 2>so I remember I used to like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't allowed to touch his guitars </v>

255
00:10:24.741 --> 00:10:26.640
<v Speaker 2>but I was allowed to look at them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I remember one day I was walking past</v>

256
00:10:26.641 --> 00:10:28.740
<v Speaker 2>the bedroom and I saw a guitar case </v>
<v Speaker 2>under the bed and I was like,</v>

257
00:10:28.741 --> 00:10:29.730
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder what that is.</v>

258
00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:34.940
<v Speaker 2>Did he get a new guitar?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I went and slipped the thing out and </v>

259
00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:34.940
<v Speaker 2>I flipped it open.</v>

260
00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:38.090
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a sawed off shotgun in a guitar </v>

261
00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:38.090
<v Speaker 2>case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just lay in there,</v>

262
00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:39.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the house or you know,</v>

263
00:10:39.541 --> 00:10:42.660
<v Speaker 2>I'd go to open something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be like 10 pounds of weed,</v>

264
00:10:42.661 --> 00:10:43.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just this system.</v>

265
00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:45.990
<v Speaker 2>That was the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the world I grew up in.</v>

266
00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:48.300
<v Speaker 2>Where did you grow up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Outside of Chicago.</v>

267
00:10:48.301 --> 00:10:50.490
<v Speaker 2>About an hour outside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

268
00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:51.480
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my dad,</v>

269
00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:54.840
<v Speaker 2>my dad got arrested a bunch of times and</v>
<v Speaker 2>massive bus and drug.</v>

270
00:10:54.841 --> 00:10:59.841
<v Speaker 2>It's just crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then got people knocking on the door in </v>

271
00:10:59.841 --> 00:11:00.240
<v Speaker 2>the middle of the night and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and getting shot at and my dad says he's</v>

272

<v Speaker 2>Never hit.</v>

273
00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:04.770
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's luck.</v>

274
00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:07.640
<v Speaker 2>Stabbed two or three times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>

275
00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:08.570
<v Speaker 2>My favorite story with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

276
00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:10.230
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of my favorite stories,</v>

277
00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:11.790
<v Speaker 2>my father was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

278
00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:16.800
<v Speaker 2>he was doing a drug deal and or he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>buying drugs and like,</v>

279
00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:22.080
<v Speaker 2>so he stops and wearing the guy got in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the car and then the guy pulled out a </v>

280
00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:24.750
<v Speaker 2>gun and stuck it in his ribs in and did </v>
<v Speaker 2>like give me all your money.</v>

281
00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:28.290
<v Speaker 2>And my dad looked and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kill me base because he was unhappy.</v>

282
00:11:28.291 --> 00:11:29.910
<v Speaker 2>So he figured I fucking just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

283
00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:31.080
<v Speaker 2>just kill me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the guy,</v>

284
00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:36.250
<v Speaker 2>the guy flipped out and left the car and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he told you all this.</v>

285
00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:37.920
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a lot of these stories.</v>

286
00:11:37.921 --> 00:11:40.620
<v Speaker 2>Post-Haste yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is he still around?</v>

287
00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:41.460
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's still around.</v>

288
00:11:41.461 --> 00:11:45.150
<v Speaker 2>He's still kicking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was it for him,</v>

289
00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:49.020
<v Speaker 2>like seeing you as a son?</v>
<v Speaker 2>As a weird thing?</v>

290
00:11:49.021 --> 00:11:53.070
<v Speaker 2>Because in the beginning he was very </v>
<v Speaker 2>dismissive of the music.</v>

291
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:58.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was not supportive of me playing the </v>

292
00:11:58.170 --> 00:11:58.170
<v Speaker 2>guitar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He and my father was a great musician.</v>

293
00:11:58.170 --> 00:11:58.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that with great sincerity.</v>

294
00:11:58.901 --> 00:12:03.901
<v Speaker 2>My father was truly talented and I'm in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the beginning he was not supportive at </v>

295
00:12:05.381 --> 00:12:07.000
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't want me to play the guitar,</v>

296
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:10.150
<v Speaker 2>didn't want me involved in music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even after I put out my first album,</v>

297
00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:15.510
<v Speaker 2>which went on to be at the time was like</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most successful independent album </v>

298
00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:15.510
<v Speaker 2>ever released.</v>

299
00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:17.440
<v Speaker 2>So it wasn't like an insignificant </v>
<v Speaker 2>moment in my life.</v>

300
00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:19.240
<v Speaker 2>My Dad would just kind of shrugged her </v>
<v Speaker 2>shoulders,</v>

301
00:12:19.241 --> 00:12:20.050
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's okay,</v>

302
00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:20.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>

303
00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:22.900
<v Speaker 2>what are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like wow,</v>

304
00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:24.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you know,</v>

305
00:12:24.401 --> 00:12:27.010
<v Speaker 2>my earliest guitar heavy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's cool stuff,</v>

306
00:12:27.011 --> 00:12:28.480
<v Speaker 2>Solos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was just like,</v>

307
00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:33.490
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't until my second album in the </v>

308
00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:35.941
<v Speaker 2>band blew up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then he started kind of changed his </v>

309
00:12:35.941 --> 00:12:35.941
<v Speaker 2>tune.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then he became more supportive.</v>

310
00:12:35.941 --> 00:12:39.751
<v Speaker 2>Then he got really weirdly jealous who.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he started doing weird things </v>

311
00:12:39.751 --> 00:12:40.180
<v Speaker 2>like he call me and it'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

312
00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:44.320
<v Speaker 2>if you need me to write you any songs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm like number one.</v>

313
00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:46.420
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's asking me to write songs.</v>

314
00:12:46.421 --> 00:12:51.421
<v Speaker 2>It was so weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then he was also a lot of drugs and </v>

315
00:12:51.421 --> 00:12:51.421
<v Speaker 2>so there was that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

316
00:12:51.421 --> 00:12:53.740
<v Speaker 2>there's that interweave of like and </v>
<v Speaker 2>weird stuff like,</v>

317
00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:54.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

318
00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:56.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one day he calls me and he's like,</v>

319
00:12:56.830 --> 00:13:00.100
<v Speaker 2>my dad always played this cool 19,</v>
<v Speaker 2>64,</v>

320
00:13:00.101 --> 00:13:00.940
<v Speaker 2>purple flying b.</v>

321
00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:02.730
<v Speaker 2>That was like his guitar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

322
00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:04.120
<v Speaker 2>and my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my dad,</v>

323
00:13:04.121 --> 00:13:06.130
<v Speaker 2>to me it was like a star and he still is</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my mind.</v>

324
00:13:06.131 --> 00:13:07.280
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

325
00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:08.900
<v Speaker 2>he told me one day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

326
00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:11.500
<v Speaker 2>when I die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to give you my guitar.</v>

327
00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:13.390
<v Speaker 2>And then fast forward four years later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he calls me up.</v>

328
00:13:13.391 --> 00:13:13.770
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

329
00:13:13.771 --> 00:13:15.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Put this guitar and Ebay.</v>

330
00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:16.900
<v Speaker 2>So he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do you want to buy it?</v>

331
00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:20.150
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to buy the guitar.</v>

332
00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:21.610
<v Speaker 2>You're supposed to get what he does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

333
00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:23.770
<v Speaker 2>Fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just weird stuff like that.</v>

334
00:13:23.771 --> 00:13:25.780
<v Speaker 2>It's been a lot of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anybody who's grown up in that,</v>

335
00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:27.700
<v Speaker 2>those types of situations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not talking about.</v>

336
00:13:27.701 --> 00:13:32.701
<v Speaker 2>It's like wacky world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're never quite sure what angle was </v>

337
00:13:32.701 --> 00:13:35.341
<v Speaker 2>going on because the need for money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>depending on what situation is going on,</v>

338
00:13:37.511 --> 00:13:37.780
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

339
00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:40.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you weren't reinforced.</v>

340
00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:42.380
<v Speaker 3>You reinforce this idea that I've always</v>
<v Speaker 3>had that.</v>

341
00:13:42.381 --> 00:13:45.230
<v Speaker 3>Everyone that I know that's interesting </v>
<v Speaker 3>came from a fucked up childhood.</v>

342
00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:48.980
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't argue against it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard because.</v>

343
00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:51.320
<v Speaker 3>Do you have children?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have one son.</v>

344
00:13:51.321 --> 00:13:51.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's.</v>

345
00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:53.930
<v Speaker 3>He's just going to be too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's for me,</v>

346
00:13:53.931 --> 00:13:54.770
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so.</v>

347
00:13:55.070 --> 00:14:00.070
<v Speaker 3>It's a conflict because I take care of </v>
<v Speaker 3>my kids and I'm around and I give him a </v>

348
00:14:01.881 --> 00:14:05.050
<v Speaker 3>lot of love there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not fucked up and I'm like,</v>

349
00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:09.110
<v Speaker 3>my kid's going to be boring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think all of my friends,</v>

350
00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:14.380
<v Speaker 3>all of them come from fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 3>household chaos and they created the </v>

351
00:14:14.931 --> 00:14:16.520
<v Speaker 3>pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Created these diamonds.</v>

352
00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:21.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something to be said for the </v>

353
00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:22.010
<v Speaker 2>adversity and my dad would even say to </v>
<v Speaker 2>me weird things like,</v>

354
00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:25.670
<v Speaker 2>it's good you had a fucked up childhood </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it made you successful.</v>

355
00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:30.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thinking like I would have preferred </v>

356
00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:30.970
<v Speaker 2>like Disneyland with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

357
00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:34.880
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I wouldn't have been miserable at </v>
<v Speaker 2>Disneyland if it wasn't for you dad.</v>

358
00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:37.920
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think your story's amazing though.</v>

359
00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:42.950
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know it probably sucked growing up </v>

360
00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:42.950
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but damn,</v>

361
00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:46.851
<v Speaker 3>to be able to tell everybody your dad </v>
<v Speaker 3>was his guitar playing tote and drug </v>

362
00:14:47.281 --> 00:14:51.470
<v Speaker 3>deal in psycho.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's a bad ass story.</v>

363
00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:52.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's</v>

364
00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:54.110
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you'll appreciate this in the,</v>

365
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:59.230
<v Speaker 2>in the gangster tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there was this thing that happened </v>

366
00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:01.900
<v Speaker 2>when I was probably about 10 or 12 where</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a local club and you know,</v>

367
00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:06.080
<v Speaker 2>and my dad played there all the time and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I came back to the House one day and the</v>

368
00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:09.380
<v Speaker 2>house was full of just like smokey </v>
<v Speaker 2>equipment,</v>

369
00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:11.300
<v Speaker 2>like you could smell like smoke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fire.</v>

370
00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:13.130
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he said,</v>

371
00:15:13.131 --> 00:15:14.300
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the club burned down.</v>

372
00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:17.640
<v Speaker 2>And so they had ran in the fire or </v>
<v Speaker 2>retrieve the gear,</v>

373
00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:22.660
<v Speaker 2>some kind of story like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that was the story for years was </v>

374
00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:26.021
<v Speaker 2>he was eating across the street pancakes</v>
<v Speaker 2>at four in the morning and saw the club </v>

375
00:15:26.021 --> 00:15:26.900
<v Speaker 2>burned down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Years later I heard the real story.</v>

376
00:15:26.901 --> 00:15:30.140
<v Speaker 2>He was in a car with a chick doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

377
00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:33.740
<v Speaker 2>and he saw some mob guy walk in the club</v>
<v Speaker 2>with gasoline,</v>

378
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:37.520
<v Speaker 2>light the club on fire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he knew it was arson,</v>

379
00:15:37.521 --> 00:15:42.521
<v Speaker 2>but because he knew it was mob related,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he couldn't say anything and that's </v>

380
00:15:42.521 --> 00:15:46.240
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like every story is like there's </v>

381
00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:46.240
<v Speaker 2>the real story and the story I got when </v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a kid,</v>

382
00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:48.230
<v Speaker 2>so he ran into the fire just to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>equipment.</v>

383
00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:50.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he ran in and got his guitar.</v>

384
00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:54.680
<v Speaker 2>He was able to save his guitar and then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then.</v>

385
00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:59.770
<v Speaker 2>And then of course the police came and </v>
<v Speaker 2>questioned him because they knew he had </v>

386
00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:05.920
<v Speaker 2>was there on the scene or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course he said I didn't see </v>

387
00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:07.760
<v Speaker 2>anything because he didn't want to die </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of Chicago with the mob.</v>

388
00:16:07.761 --> 00:16:08.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>forget about it.</v>

389
00:16:08.511 --> 00:16:12.020
<v Speaker 2>Especially back then in the seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like they ran the town,</v>

390
00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:14.180
<v Speaker 2>they got Kennedy elected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

391
00:16:14.181 --> 00:16:15.000
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that.</v>

392
00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:17.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the stories about Chicago are legendary.</v>

393
00:16:17.571 --> 00:16:20.180
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like people used to come to Chicago back</v>

394
00:16:20.181 --> 00:16:21.260
<v Speaker 2>in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a little bit different now.</v>

395
00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:22.030
<v Speaker 2>People come,</v>
<v Speaker 2>PAC man,</v>

396
00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:23.930
<v Speaker 2>the city is so clean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so organized.</v>

397
00:16:23.931 --> 00:16:24.390
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

398
00:16:24.391 --> 00:16:26.920
<v Speaker 2>because it's run by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

399
00:16:26.921 --> 00:16:28.580
<v Speaker 2>Capo is all over the city.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

400
00:16:28.581 --> 00:16:30.230
<v Speaker 2>every ward had its capo and</v>

401
00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:36.290
<v Speaker 3>yes to Congo has is uniquely violent </v>
<v Speaker 3>history and even to this day with,</v>

402
00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:39.360
<v Speaker 3>with what's going on in the south side </v>
<v Speaker 3>with all the gangs,</v>

403
00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:40.180
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

404
00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:42.980
<v Speaker 2>it's shocking to me as somebody who was </v>
<v Speaker 2>born in Chicago,</v>

405
00:16:42.981 --> 00:16:47.981
<v Speaker 2>I still live in Chicago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's just like we've normalized </v>

406
00:16:47.981 --> 00:16:50.030
<v Speaker 2>this insane violence in our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this community.</v>

407
00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:55.370
<v Speaker 3>We don't even realize.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think most people have no idea how </v>

408
00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:55.370
<v Speaker 3>much gun violence</v>

409
00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:55.830
<v Speaker 2>those I heard the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could,</v>

410
00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:58.020
<v Speaker 2>I could be wrong and I'm sure you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>find,</v>

411
00:16:58.021 --> 00:17:01.650
<v Speaker 2>but I think somebody said the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's been 3,700</v>

412
00:17:01.651 --> 00:17:06.651
<v Speaker 2>shootings in Chicago already this year </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think we're already over 600 gun </v>

413
00:17:06.651 --> 00:17:08.730
<v Speaker 2>fatalities and this isn't like every </v>
<v Speaker 2>year now.</v>

414
00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:10.650
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I just,</v>

415
00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:15.740
<v Speaker 2>and even trump at some point flooded out</v>
<v Speaker 2>like maybe they should bring the </v>

416
00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:15.740
<v Speaker 2>national guard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish they would do something.</v>

417
00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:20.220
<v Speaker 2>I just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Such a dis generational tragedy that </v>

418
00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:20.760
<v Speaker 2>just keeps going and nothing seems to </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

419
00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:26.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it seems to have a lot of momentum </v>

420
00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:26.100
<v Speaker 3>behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the murders they,</v>

421
00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:30.930
<v Speaker 3>they've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they make people have revenge murders </v>

422
00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:34.261
<v Speaker 3>and then it just piles on top of each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other and it doesn't seem like there's </v>

423
00:17:34.261 --> 00:17:34.410
<v Speaker 3>any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any stopping it inside.</v>

424
00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:35.450
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing,</v>

425
00:17:35.451 --> 00:17:37.700
<v Speaker 2>and this is the classic tale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

426
00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:42.910
<v Speaker 2>It was reported the other day that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>car jackings in Chicago have gone up </v>

427
00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:45.851
<v Speaker 2>like 200 percent and now those </v>
<v Speaker 2>carjackings are filtering into the nice </v>

428
00:17:45.851 --> 00:17:46.340
<v Speaker 2>neighborhoods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

429
00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:49.040
<v Speaker 2>so now you're gonna start seeing some </v>
<v Speaker 2>action because now,</v>

430
00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:50.010
<v Speaker 2>now</v>

431
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:52.410
<v Speaker 1>it's blowing up past the sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

432
00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:53.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at that,</v>

433
00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:58.790
<v Speaker 1>the shot clock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a person is shot every two minutes and </v>

434
00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:01.260
<v Speaker 1>20 seconds a person is murdered every 12</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours.</v>

435
00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:06.330
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two hours and 20 minutes a person is </v>

436
00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:08.340
<v Speaker 1>murdered every 12 hours and 23 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot.</v>

437
00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:12.570
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

438
00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:14.340
<v Speaker 1>it's my home and I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

439
00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:20.030
<v Speaker 1>I have a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a guy that I met when I was down </v>

440
00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:20.030
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a driver.</v>

441
00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:21.000
<v Speaker 1>He drove us around and he was saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>that uh,</v>

442
00:18:21.001 --> 00:18:24.390
<v Speaker 1>he used to be a cop and that would </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen was they arrested some of the top</v>

443
00:18:24.391 --> 00:18:29.391
<v Speaker 1>level drug dealers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard this exact same story and as </v>

444
00:18:29.391 --> 00:18:29.730
<v Speaker 1>soon as they did that there became this </v>
<v Speaker 1>power vacuum.</v>

445
00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:33.930
<v Speaker 1>And then for years I got a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>insight information for years.</v>

446
00:18:33.931 --> 00:18:38.190
<v Speaker 1>What I'd heard is that they had this </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of like as long as you stay on this</v>

447
00:18:38.191 --> 00:18:40.270
<v Speaker 1>side of the street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll kind of,</v>

448
00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:45.680
<v Speaker 1>we'll look the other way for this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you got to keep your people in line </v>

449
00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:45.680
<v Speaker 1>over here.</v>

450
00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:49.730
<v Speaker 1>And I know enough people in the PD that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was sort of the general </v>

451
00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:52.461
<v Speaker 1>understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like even like I remember one time </v>

452
00:18:52.461 --> 00:18:52.461
<v Speaker 1>because I knew somebody who worked in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

453
00:18:52.461 --> 00:18:56.310
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in like the gang taskforce as like how </v>

454
00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:57.060
<v Speaker 1>come there's always whores on the bridge</v>
<v Speaker 1>on Friday night.</v>

455
00:18:57.061 --> 00:18:59.010
<v Speaker 1>Like don't you guys see the 50 whores </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the bridge?</v>

456
00:18:59.011 --> 00:18:59.910
<v Speaker 1>And they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

457
00:18:59.911 --> 00:19:01.980
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where we tell all the horse to go</v>

458
00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:07.390
<v Speaker 1>so we can protect them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd rather have them there so we can </v>

459
00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:10.941
<v Speaker 1>keep an eye on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we know what's going to happen </v>

460
00:19:10.941 --> 00:19:12.951
<v Speaker 1>anyway so better we control it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was the way Chicago started </v>

461
00:19:12.951 --> 00:19:15.780
<v Speaker 1>operated was like we'll tolerate crime </v>
<v Speaker 1>up to this level in twice a year.</v>

462
00:19:15.781 --> 00:19:18.620
<v Speaker 1>We'll run everybody in just to Kinda </v>
<v Speaker 1>make the,</v>

463
00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:23.810
<v Speaker 1>make it look good in the paper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then apparently whatever they did </v>

464
00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:24.720
<v Speaker 1>that created this power vacuum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just what I've heard.</v>

465
00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:29.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scott was a former cop and the way he </v>

466
00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:29.820
<v Speaker 1>was describing it was pretty absolute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

467
00:19:29.821 --> 00:19:31.120
<v Speaker 1>they made a mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

468
00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:34.920
<v Speaker 1>this solution that you were saying of </v>
<v Speaker 1>like kind of like saying,</v>

469
00:19:34.921 --> 00:19:37.200
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep it over here or keep it under wraps</v>

470
00:19:37.201 --> 00:19:39.180
<v Speaker 1>and we'll arrest a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

471
00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:43.110
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like maybe that's the only way</v>
<v Speaker 1>to manage it.</v>

472
00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:49.160
<v Speaker 1>Well the one thing I do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have heard from people that are in </v>

473
00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:50.790
<v Speaker 1>those communities is that literally the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this may be supports.</v>

474
00:19:50.791 --> 00:19:55.791
<v Speaker 1>What you're saying is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the power divisions are like block the </v>

475
00:19:55.791 --> 00:19:59.541
<v Speaker 1>block.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's almost like an insurgency where </v>

476
00:19:59.541 --> 00:20:01.770
<v Speaker 1>it's like two blocks versus two blocks </v>
<v Speaker 1>versus one block versus three blocks.</v>

477
00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:04.620
<v Speaker 1>So literally if you're walking on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong side of the street,</v>

478
00:20:04.621 --> 00:20:06.810
<v Speaker 1>it's not even like neighborhood to </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood,</v>

479
00:20:06.811 --> 00:20:09.870
<v Speaker 1>it's like block to block,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is crazy.</v>

480
00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:11.700
<v Speaker 1>And just growing up in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood,</v>

481
00:20:11.701 --> 00:20:16.701
<v Speaker 1>having that be your normal as a child </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then growing into adulthood around </v>

482
00:20:18.091 --> 00:20:23.091
<v Speaker 1>that and having just used to people </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting shot used to shooting people </v>

483
00:20:23.091 --> 00:20:27.291
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if there's that many people </v>

484
00:20:27.291 --> 00:20:27.291
<v Speaker 1>getting shot and that many gunshots </v>
<v Speaker 1>going off,</v>

485
00:20:27.291 --> 00:20:29.820
<v Speaker 1>everybody must be common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it must be common everyone.</v>

486
00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:31.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

487
00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:33.750
<v Speaker 1>It's just crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just heartbreaking.</v>

488
00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:37.020
<v Speaker 1>It's such a unique town too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an amazing city.</v>

489
00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:39.210
<v Speaker 1>It really is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

490
00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:42.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean we have this weird bare knuckle </v>
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>

491
00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:43.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's still there,</v>

492
00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:44.610
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

493
00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:48.370
<v Speaker 1>no amount of yuppies moving and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>changed as sort of working sort of ethos</v>

494
00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:52.540
<v Speaker 1>while you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of symbolized by the food that</v>

495
00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:56.110
<v Speaker 1>giant pizza.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

496
00:20:56.111 --> 00:20:58.240
<v Speaker 1>We like to eat depth pizzas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Insane.</v>

497
00:20:58.510 --> 00:21:00.460
<v Speaker 1>That what you deliver those pizzas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

498
00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:01.090
<v Speaker 1>Did you really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

499
00:21:01.091 --> 00:21:02.020
<v Speaker 1>that was one of my gigs.</v>

500
00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:05.400
<v Speaker 1>I bet it builds your arms up heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

501
00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:07.770
<v Speaker 1>First time I ate a Chicago deep dish </v>
<v Speaker 1>pizza,</v>

502
00:21:07.771 --> 00:21:08.350
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

503
00:21:08.351 --> 00:21:10.480
<v Speaker 1>is this really a pizza?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what do we see?</v>

504
00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:12.190
<v Speaker 1>This is a casserole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

505
00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:17.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like tardy people too.</v>

506
00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:22.380
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's something about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chicago that seems to me to have like </v>

507
00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:24.400
<v Speaker 1>the momentum of the old days still </v>
<v Speaker 1>deeply entrenched in it,</v>

508
00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:28.840
<v Speaker 1>whereas that doesn't seem the case in La</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of other big cities.</v>

509
00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:32.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like kind of weird Yuppy yuppy</v>

510
00:21:32.081 --> 00:21:32.850
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I call it yet,</v>

511
00:21:32.851 --> 00:21:33.910
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know what you want to call </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

512
00:21:33.911 --> 00:21:37.870
<v Speaker 1>but if it's like South Park did that </v>
<v Speaker 1>episode where it's like,</v>

513
00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:43.610
<v Speaker 1>it's not like once the whole foods moves</v>
<v Speaker 1>in like everyone's supposed to live a </v>

514
00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:44.230
<v Speaker 1>certain way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you see that episode?</v>

515
00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:48.490
<v Speaker 1>But it's like this funny bit about like </v>
<v Speaker 1>how the whole foods sort of anchors down</v>

516
00:21:48.491 --> 00:21:49.720
<v Speaker 1>this new way of life.</v>

517
00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:52.430
<v Speaker 1>Some kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

518
00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:57.450
<v Speaker 1>riff on that said it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet it does in some way.</v>

519
00:21:57.730 --> 00:21:59.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's this idea of sort of like a,</v>

520
00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:05.040
<v Speaker 1>you can drop this homogenous idea of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what modern cultures like in any place </v>

521
00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:07.090
<v Speaker 1>and it will just sort of riff out like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>spore.</v>

522
00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:12.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like we've got the whole foods and </v>

523
00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:12.150
<v Speaker 1>we've got the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

524
00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:15.540
<v Speaker 1>the starbucks and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now we're all going to be nice to </v>

525
00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:15.730
<v Speaker 1>each other or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a weird,</v>

526
00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:21.210
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we're all just going to start </v>

527
00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:21.210
<v Speaker 1>behaving better because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

528
00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:22.000
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I understand the joke.</v>

529
00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:23.110
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do,</v>

530
00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:24.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think uh,</v>

531
00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:29.670
<v Speaker 1>but again saying your environment that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you grew up in this chaos and then </v>

532
00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:31.300
<v Speaker 1>coming from Chicago and coming from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

533
00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:34.970
<v Speaker 1>the stories you're telling about your </v>
<v Speaker 1>dad that had to contribute to like the,</v>

534
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.140
<v Speaker 1>the deepness and intensity of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>music.</v>

535
00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:40.080
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno,</v>

536
00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:45.110
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I certainly revolted against suburban </v>

537
00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:45.110
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

538
00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:46.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean the suburban life of that world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

539
00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:48.460
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just couldn't take it.</v>

540
00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:49.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

541
00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:51.270
<v Speaker 1>Just couldn't take it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The mall,</v>

542
00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:53.510
<v Speaker 1>the mall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Strip mall vibe,</v>

543
00:22:53.511 --> 00:22:56.560
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was just a rat in a cage,</v>

544
00:22:56.561 --> 00:22:57.370
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

545
00:22:57.371 --> 00:22:57.630
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

546
00:22:57.650 --> 00:23:02.650
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the great thing is then I traded one </v>

547
00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:02.650
<v Speaker 1>imprisonment suburbia for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

548
00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:05.830
<v Speaker 1>rock and roll aesthetics and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's,</v>

549
00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:08.370
<v Speaker 1>who gets to say who is integral and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

550
00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:10.450
<v Speaker 1>who's cool and not cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

551
00:23:10.451 --> 00:23:15.451
<v Speaker 1>That would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that drove me insane to WHO's selling </v>

552
00:23:15.451 --> 00:23:15.451
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

553
00:23:15.451 --> 00:23:16.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean the first line of um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

554
00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:23.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first line of our second album is </v>

555
00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:23.470
<v Speaker 1>freak out and given it doesn't matter </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you believe in,</v>

556
00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:24.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

557
00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:29.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you gotta you gotTa play by </v>

558
00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:31.680
<v Speaker 1>now you've got to play by these rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to kiss this ring and you </v>

559
00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:32.500
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just music.</v>

560
00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:37.510
<v Speaker 1>So He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the weird thing too is that people </v>

561
00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:37.510
<v Speaker 1>really enjoy you when they're the only </v>
<v Speaker 1>ones who know about you.</v>

562
00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:39.580
<v Speaker 1>And then as you started getting bigger </v>
<v Speaker 1>and bigger,</v>

563
00:23:39.581 --> 00:23:41.070
<v Speaker 1>they start looking for holes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

564
00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:42.280
<v Speaker 1>we blew that up early though.</v>

565
00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:46.370
<v Speaker 1>We believe that we glued up really </v>
<v Speaker 1>early.</v>

566
00:23:46.371 --> 00:23:48.950
<v Speaker 1>We made a lot of enemies really early,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is crazy because,</v>

567
00:23:48.951 --> 00:23:53.951
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the enemies I made in the early </v>

568
00:23:53.951 --> 00:23:53.951
<v Speaker 1>nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

569
00:23:53.951 --> 00:23:53.951
<v Speaker 1>I still have them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're still sort of lurking out</v>

570
00:23:53.951 --> 00:23:55.730
<v Speaker 1>there in various holes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

571
00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:57.640
<v Speaker 1>He's like those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>

572
00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:58.870
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

573
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.850
<v Speaker 1>inner seen rivalries never end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

574
00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:06.940
<v Speaker 1>between bands or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I've had weird experiences </v>

575
00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:11.110
<v Speaker 1>with like people not with Nirvana people</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like people who were in the nirvana </v>

576
00:24:12.171 --> 00:24:17.171
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's still like this weird like </v>

577
00:24:17.171 --> 00:24:20.400
<v Speaker 1>because I'm from Pumpkin World,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like pee out sometimes I'll have weird </v>

578
00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:20.780
<v Speaker 1>stuff happen and I'll dig down and find </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

579
00:24:20.781 --> 00:24:25.781
<v Speaker 1>It was like somebody who used to work in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nirvana world trying to cut my ankles 27</v>

580
00:24:26.121 --> 00:24:27.920
<v Speaker 1>years later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like so weird.</v>

581
00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:33.130
<v Speaker 1>Like so parochial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole Nirvana scene is a very </v>

582
00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:33.130
<v Speaker 1>strange scene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

583
00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:38.130
<v Speaker 1>whenever the main guy commit suicide and</v>
<v Speaker 1>this oddly conspiratorial way,</v>

584
00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:43.700
<v Speaker 1>did you watch that fucked up movie </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's now a lot of people don't know.</v>

585
00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:45.980
<v Speaker 1>I was sort of around for a lot of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

586
00:24:45.981 --> 00:24:49.370
<v Speaker 1>So I know a lot of stuff that I've never</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of talked about.</v>

587
00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:51.860
<v Speaker 1>So for me watching that stuff is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

588
00:24:51.861 --> 00:24:53.830
<v Speaker 1>it's replaying something I don't want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>replay.</v>

589
00:24:53.850 --> 00:24:58.850
<v Speaker 1>And B,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of the stuff is not based </v>

590
00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:01.601
<v Speaker 1>on fact because I was around for a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of it and no one's ever talked to me </v>

591
00:25:01.601 --> 00:25:03.200
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So people tried to pimp me out like in a</v>

592
00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:08.440
<v Speaker 1>q and a with fans and asked me questions</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'm suddenly going to talk about </v>

593
00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:08.440
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

594
00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:09.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

595
00:25:10.030 --> 00:25:12.100
<v Speaker 1>that documentary was so strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

596
00:25:12.101 --> 00:25:12.770
<v Speaker 1>how does someone get it</v>

597
00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:14.660
<v Speaker 3>way with that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the recreation's,</v>

598
00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:17.540
<v Speaker 3>like if you weren't there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't know what the fuck they said.</v>

599
00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:22.660
<v Speaker 3>So if you don't know what the fuck they </v>
<v Speaker 3>said and you're putting words in these </v>

600
00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:24.030
<v Speaker 3>actors' mouths and having them play it </v>
<v Speaker 3>out like you're just this,</v>

601
00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:26.020
<v Speaker 3>this should be illegal because you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of.</v>

602
00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:28.300
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like your car,</v>

603
00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:30.560
<v Speaker 3>especially when you're talking about a </v>
<v Speaker 3>murder mystery,</v>

604
00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:31.420
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

605
00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:33.830
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're saying that it wasn't a suicide.</v>

606
00:25:33.831 --> 00:25:34.260
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

607
00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:39.350
<v Speaker 3>you're at least putting out the idea </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it might be a murderer the way </v>

608
00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:40.820
<v Speaker 3>you're doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's by manufacturing words that you</v>

609
00:25:40.821 --> 00:25:44.030
<v Speaker 3>have no idea if they were ever say it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>complete fiction.</v>

610
00:25:44.031 --> 00:25:44.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

611
00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:45.230
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so like,</v>

612
00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:45.720
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

613
00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:46.460
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

614
00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:50.250
<v Speaker 1>I was around for the before sorta during</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

615
00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:53.040
<v Speaker 1>and certainly a lot after and I know a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of stuff that again,</v>

616
00:25:53.250 --> 00:25:57.170
<v Speaker 1>I know is not in the public domain and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so I,</v>

617
00:25:57.380 --> 00:25:59.010
<v Speaker 1>I go with what I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

618
00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:00.420
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

619
00:26:00.421 --> 00:26:02.520
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that whole nirvana thing was.</v>

620
00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:07.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember the first time I heard </v>

621
00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:09.021
<v Speaker 1>Nirvana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a kid in Boston and this buddy of </v>

00:26:09.021 --> 00:26:12.270

<v Speaker 1>we'd never heard anything like that.</v>

623
00:26:12.271 --> 00:26:13.050
<v Speaker 1>We were like,</v>

630
00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:30.851

<v Speaker 1>fenway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember what it's called.</v>

<v Speaker 2>guy who's Kinda like,</v>

644
00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:58.650
<v Speaker 2>you kinda controlled everything before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

645
00:26:58.680 --> 00:26:59.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>totally.</v>

646
00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:03.860
<v Speaker 2>So what is it like for you to have Ruben</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the mix and.</v>

647
00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:05.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well rick's of friends.</v>

648
00:27:05.541 --> 00:27:10.541
<v Speaker 2>So for me it was like I was sort of at a</v>
<v Speaker 2>low point and he kind of picked me up </v>

649
00:27:10.541 --> 00:27:14.031
<v Speaker 2>when I was down so it was like I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>mind sort of trusting him with like the </v>

650
00:27:14.031 --> 00:27:17.901
<v Speaker 2>head part of it all kind of like you </v>
<v Speaker 2>deal with that part and I'm just going </v>

651
00:27:17.901 --> 00:27:20.910
<v Speaker 2>to sort of be up to the performer and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the weird guy in the corner and give you</v>

652
00:27:20.911 --> 00:27:21.990
<v Speaker 2>relief.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

653
00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:27.110
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt like it allowed me to focus on </v>

654
00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:27.480
<v Speaker 2>the music and the performance and Sorta </v>
<v Speaker 2>just freed me to just,</v>

655
00:27:28.810 --> 00:27:29.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

656
00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:32.010
<v Speaker 2>Because sometimes you can psych yourself</v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

657
00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:35.400
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that makes any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you can have a really good song,</v>

658
00:27:35.401 --> 00:27:40.401
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a good song and then you start </v>

659
00:27:40.401 --> 00:27:40.401
<v Speaker 2>second guessing yourself and they start </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking,</v>

660
00:27:40.401 --> 00:27:41.790
<v Speaker 2>well maybe this song is not good enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then that'll,</v>

661
00:27:41.850 --> 00:27:45.210
<v Speaker 2>that'll infiltrate into your performance</v>
<v Speaker 2>as opposed to being free.</v>

662
00:27:45.211 --> 00:27:45.530
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

663
00:27:45.531 --> 00:27:47.880
<v Speaker 2>I've just got a good song and if that </v>
<v Speaker 2>one doesn't work,</v>

664
00:27:47.881 --> 00:27:52.881
<v Speaker 2>I've got another good song.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So letting rick kind of do the picking </v>

665
00:27:52.881 --> 00:27:54.570
<v Speaker 2>and choosing and that's a good take and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good song.</v>

666
00:27:54.571 --> 00:27:55.260
<v Speaker 2>It was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

667
00:27:55.261 --> 00:27:56.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to kind of just go down </v>
<v Speaker 2>this road.</v>

668
00:27:57.150 --> 00:28:01.500
<v Speaker 2>It took me back to sort of a more </v>
<v Speaker 2>innocent way of approaching the work and</v>

669
00:28:01.501 --> 00:28:03.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm very grateful to him for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's awesome.</v>

670
00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:08.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got to be quite a mind fuck to </v>

671
00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:11.361
<v Speaker 2>create something and then practice it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and rehearse it over and over again and </v>

672
00:28:11.361 --> 00:28:13.170
<v Speaker 2>tweak it and mess with it and not know </v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

673
00:28:13.171 --> 00:28:18.171
<v Speaker 2>like not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not almost not be able to be objective </v>

674
00:28:18.171 --> 00:28:18.171
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

675
00:28:18.171 --> 00:28:19.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well the weird thing is is I hope people</v>

676
00:28:19.141 --> 00:28:20.010
<v Speaker 2>can appreciate it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How.</v>

677
00:28:20.011 --> 00:28:22.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is like at one point when I.</v>

678
00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:25.740
<v Speaker 2>my ear was really at the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was able to do that.</v>

679
00:28:25.741 --> 00:28:28.170
<v Speaker 2>I was able to be objective and </v>
<v Speaker 2>subjective,</v>

680
00:28:28.330 --> 00:28:32.100
<v Speaker 2>be the writer and be the producer and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>hit a lot of home runs,</v>

681
00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:34.230
<v Speaker 2>so then you get kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what I'm doing.</v>

682
00:28:34.270 --> 00:28:36.450
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then when it stops working,</v>

683
00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:39.960
<v Speaker 2>you have two choices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can blame yourself,</v>

684
00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:41.880
<v Speaker 2>which is the natural thing you should </v>
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>

685
00:28:42.150 --> 00:28:46.080
<v Speaker 2>or you can blame others and once you </v>
<v Speaker 2>start blaming others,</v>

686
00:28:46.081 --> 00:28:48.260
<v Speaker 2>now you're in this hall of mirrors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

687
00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:50.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

688
00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:52.320
<v Speaker 2>instead of raising your hand saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

689
00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:57.440
<v Speaker 2>I've had a good run.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's like getting a coach or </v>

690
00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:59.841
<v Speaker 2>something like maybe a guy goes on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>losing streak and need spring in a new </v>

691
00:28:59.841 --> 00:29:02.721
<v Speaker 2>coach to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you need to work on your </v>

692
00:29:02.721 --> 00:29:02.721
<v Speaker 2>offense.</v>

693
00:29:02.721 --> 00:29:02.721
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just somebody to tweak you.</v>

694
00:29:02.721 --> 00:29:06.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you're flying a thousand miles </v>

695
00:29:06.730 --> 00:29:09.440
<v Speaker 2>an hour and you're selling gazillions of</v>
<v Speaker 2>records and making all this money and </v>

696
00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:09.440
<v Speaker 2>you're surrounded by a bunch of sick </v>
<v Speaker 2>fence,</v>

697
00:29:09.450 --> 00:29:10.650
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

698
00:29:10.651 --> 00:29:11.670
<v Speaker 2>you need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need,</v>

699
00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:16.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you needed the doctor to come in and </v>

700
00:29:16.690 --> 00:29:16.690
<v Speaker 2>kind of search,</v>
<v Speaker 2>search,</v>

701
00:29:16.690 --> 00:29:16.690
<v Speaker 2>head out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

702
00:29:16.690 --> 00:29:20.721
<v Speaker 2>So then you start going this way and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then that's when it gets like hall of </v>

703
00:29:20.721 --> 00:29:20.721
<v Speaker 2>Mirrors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's where,</v>

704
00:29:20.721 --> 00:29:22.170
<v Speaker 2>that's where my own Hubris sorta gotten </v>
<v Speaker 2>my own way.</v>

705
00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:24.870
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't accept that I got on a losing</v>
<v Speaker 2>streak and then,</v>

706
00:29:25.330 --> 00:29:26.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to somebody like rick and say,</v>

707
00:29:26.731 --> 00:29:28.770
<v Speaker 2>I need some help.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need some objective help.</v>

708
00:29:28.771 --> 00:29:30.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you feel yourself,</v>

709
00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:32.490
<v Speaker 2>like when you were listening to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>music that you were creating,</v>

710
00:29:32.491 --> 00:29:34.200
<v Speaker 2>did you feel like you were on a losing </v>
<v Speaker 2>streak?</v>

711
00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:36.540
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No I couldn't.</v>

712
00:29:36.541 --> 00:29:39.450
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't intellectually understand why</v>

713
00:29:39.451 --> 00:29:41.500
<v Speaker 2>I was failing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It didn't make any sense to me.</v>

714
00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:44.800
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes it's just generational.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the market changes,</v>

715
00:29:44.801 --> 00:29:46.150
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not personal.</v>

716
00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:51.570
<v Speaker 2>It feels incredibly personal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why it's easier to blame </v>

717
00:29:51.570 --> 00:29:54.840
<v Speaker 2>somebody else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you don't understand the depth of </v>

718
00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:54.840
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my work here,</v>

719
00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:56.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm so deep and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not following my,</v>

720
00:29:57.310 --> 00:29:59.140
<v Speaker 2>my met a path or say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

721
00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:00.310
<v Speaker 2>And look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's most,</v>

722
00:30:00.370 --> 00:30:02.260
<v Speaker 2>most entertainment is popular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

723
00:30:02.261 --> 00:30:03.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a comedian.</v>

724
00:30:03.611 --> 00:30:08.611
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like if you get them to tell</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of jokes and the audience </v>

725
00:30:08.611 --> 00:30:08.611
<v Speaker 2>doesn't laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whose fault is it?</v>

726
00:30:08.611 --> 00:30:08.611
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

727
00:30:08.611 --> 00:30:13.190
<v Speaker 3>the mindfuck of music to me has always </v>
<v Speaker 3>been very fascinating because you guys </v>

728
00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:17.461
<v Speaker 3>create it in like a vacuum or totally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you bring it into the people.</v>

729
00:30:18.131 --> 00:30:21.400
<v Speaker 3>Like when you release an album,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get it and it's done.</v>

730
00:30:21.490 --> 00:30:22.480
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit,</v>

731
00:30:22.481 --> 00:30:23.890
<v Speaker 3>here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

732
00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:28.950
<v Speaker 3>big fan plays it for the first time and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're listening to it that I go on it </v>

733
00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:29.040
<v Speaker 3>like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all.</v>

734
00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:34.380
<v Speaker 3>Whereas we have ideas and I need an </v>
<v Speaker 3>audience to create like I need to be </v>

735
00:30:35.141 --> 00:30:36.700
<v Speaker 3>around them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't,</v>

736
00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:42.000
<v Speaker 3>I can only create so much on a laptop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of it has to be like fine tuned.</v>

737
00:30:42.521 --> 00:30:45.520
<v Speaker 3>And so by the time I record something </v>
<v Speaker 3>already,</v>

738
00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:46.920
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

739
00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:49.110
<v Speaker 2>it's already been tested,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

740
00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:50.410
<v Speaker 2>so that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go back to my point,</v>

741
00:30:50.770 --> 00:30:52.780
<v Speaker 2>if you get on a winning streak and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

742
00:30:52.890 --> 00:30:57.890
<v Speaker 2>you're creating things in a bubble and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then they work well then you want to </v>

743
00:30:57.890 --> 00:30:59.800
<v Speaker 2>take all the credit for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You forget all the thousand hours in the</v>

744
00:30:59.801 --> 00:31:03.160
<v Speaker 2>bedroom that you listen to Jimi Hendrix </v>
<v Speaker 2>or you know,</v>

745
00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:05.260
<v Speaker 2>Bauhaus or merciful fate or whatever you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

746
00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:07.120
<v Speaker 2>like that gave you all these ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

747
00:31:07.121 --> 00:31:08.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to give them credit.</v>

748
00:31:08.891 --> 00:31:11.080
<v Speaker 2>You want to be the author of your own </v>
<v Speaker 2>success.</v>

749
00:31:11.370 --> 00:31:12.970
<v Speaker 2>It starts patting you on the back and</v>

750
00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:15.000
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry to interrupt.</v>

751
00:31:15.001 --> 00:31:17.520
<v Speaker 3>I just want to be very introspective in </v>
<v Speaker 3>that regard.</v>

752
00:31:17.521 --> 00:31:18.730
<v Speaker 3>Like you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a very,</v>

753
00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:21.040
<v Speaker 3>I'm a failure with failure would do </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

754
00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:26.110
<v Speaker 3>Is that when you say failure though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you still have massive amounts of </v>

755
00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:26.110
<v Speaker 3>fans are still</v>

756
00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:26.890
<v Speaker 2>DPA expected?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

757
00:31:26.891 --> 00:31:27.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

758
00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:30.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm weird in that I've always been </v>
<v Speaker 2>willing to talk about the process,</v>

759
00:31:30.311 --> 00:31:33.110
<v Speaker 2>which again is anti gimmick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also,</v>

760
00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:34.760
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

761
00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:39.990
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always approached it more like a </v>

762
00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:41.761
<v Speaker 2>performance artist in that I'm after the</v>
<v Speaker 2>bigger message of how work intersects </v>

763
00:31:42.581 --> 00:31:47.581
<v Speaker 2>with fame intersects with personal </v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling intersects with personality and,</v>

764
00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:53.040
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how people perceive things like I </v>

765
00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:53.140
<v Speaker 2>like all that weird Andy Kaufman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uncomfortability.</v>

766
00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:58.680
<v Speaker 2>That's part of my attraction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I've been willing to use myself as </v>

767
00:31:58.680 --> 00:31:59.350
<v Speaker 2>the battering ram,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is how I ended up becoming a meme,</v>

768
00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:02.170
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because people,</v>

769
00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:04.630
<v Speaker 2>people latch onto these personalities </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've created,</v>

770
00:32:04.631 --> 00:32:07.450
<v Speaker 2>which of course are ancillary to my real</v>
<v Speaker 2>personality,</v>

771
00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:12.700
<v Speaker 2>but they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't necessarily want to give me </v>

772
00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:12.700
<v Speaker 2>credit that I'm sort of controller of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the forces at play.</v>

773
00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:15.160
<v Speaker 2>So if I say something dumb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people assume that I'm dumb.</v>

774
00:32:15.610 --> 00:32:18.310
<v Speaker 2>It's hard for them to assume that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying something dumb on purpose because</v>

775
00:32:18.311 --> 00:32:21.220
<v Speaker 2>I want a reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

776
00:32:22.450 --> 00:32:27.450
<v Speaker 3>When you become a hugely successful </v>
<v Speaker 3>musician and your life becomes touring </v>

777
00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:33.430
<v Speaker 3>big arenas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing radio shows,</v>

778
00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:35.350
<v Speaker 3>getting on the bus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting on the plane,</v>

779
00:32:35.351 --> 00:32:38.380
<v Speaker 3>all of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does it make it difficult to have like</v>

780
00:32:39.890 --> 00:32:40.160
<v Speaker 2>that</v>

781
00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:45.190
<v Speaker 1>time or the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The actual experiences to continue to </v>

782
00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:45.190
<v Speaker 1>create?</v>

783
00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:50.340
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you get so deoxygenated in the </v>

784
00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:52.480
<v Speaker 2>bubble that you start writing songs </v>
<v Speaker 2>about being on tour.</v>

785
00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:57.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like comedians will tell jokes about </v>

786
00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:57.640
<v Speaker 1>airline food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

787
00:32:57.770 --> 00:33:02.770
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to becoming sort of like you're </v>

788
00:33:02.770 --> 00:33:02.870
<v Speaker 1>trying to take people in the insularity </v>
<v Speaker 1>of your experience,</v>

789
00:33:02.871 --> 00:33:04.480
<v Speaker 1>but it's not that interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

790
00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:07.100
<v Speaker 1>At some point it becomes unrelatable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

791
00:33:07.101 --> 00:33:09.410
<v Speaker 1>I always said that about like A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's,</v>

792
00:33:09.411 --> 00:33:12.980
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of bands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some of the great allman brothers or</v>

793
00:33:12.981 --> 00:33:17.981
<v Speaker 1>Leonard Skinner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they had a bunch of songs about </v>

794
00:33:17.981 --> 00:33:20.270
<v Speaker 1>leaving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about getting away from women.</v>

795
00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:21.680
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lord,</v>

796
00:33:21.681 --> 00:33:23.990
<v Speaker 1>I was born in rambling man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

797
00:33:24.170 --> 00:33:26.990
<v Speaker 1>there was so many songs about just </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting away from women.</v>

798
00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:28.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other day I heard that crosby,</v>

799
00:33:28.611 --> 00:33:29.440
<v Speaker 1>stills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nash and song.</v>

800
00:33:29.450 --> 00:33:34.450
<v Speaker 1>It's like just a song before I go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all about he's going on tour and </v>

801
00:33:34.450 --> 00:33:35.000
<v Speaker 1>they go to the airport and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable.</v>

802
00:33:35.001 --> 00:33:37.100
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's such a going onto her song.</v>

803
00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:38.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's like,</v>

804
00:33:38.211 --> 00:33:41.420
<v Speaker 1>it's really not that relatable to most </v>
<v Speaker 1>people know to a lot of people.</v>

805
00:33:41.421 --> 00:33:42.400
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

806
00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:44.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>skinner had a shitload of those.</v>

807
00:33:45.050 --> 00:33:50.050
<v Speaker 1>They really did have quite a few songs </v>
<v Speaker 1>about like getting the fuck out of </v>

808
00:33:50.050 --> 00:33:51.460
<v Speaker 1>dodge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were good.</v>

809
00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:54.590
<v Speaker 1>Such a great band.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Giant fan.</v>

810
00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:59.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're probably the greatest thing to </v>

811
00:33:59.620 --> 00:33:59.620
<v Speaker 1>ever come out of Florida.</v>

812
00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:00.250
<v Speaker 1>It's arguable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

813
00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:01.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to think who else came out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Florida?</v>

814
00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:06.770
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jim Brewer.</v>

815
00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:10.260
<v Speaker 1>I thought we were talking about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>already.</v>

816
00:34:10.290 --> 00:34:14.070
<v Speaker 1>Just talking about music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have anything else when it comes</v>

817
00:34:14.071 --> 00:34:15.570
<v Speaker 1>to music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who else?</v>

818
00:34:15.590 --> 00:34:18.480
<v Speaker 1>Pit Bull.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

819
00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:19.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

820
00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:21.860
<v Speaker 1>It's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

821
00:34:21.870 --> 00:34:23.010
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So do you,</v>

822
00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:26.270
<v Speaker 1>did you feel it while it was happening?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you're,</v>

823
00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:28.740
<v Speaker 1>you're doing these mega tours and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

824
00:34:28.741 --> 00:34:32.160
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel like this staleness and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>creation?</v>

825
00:34:32.830 --> 00:34:34.230
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>

826
00:34:34.350 --> 00:34:39.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what I tried to do is change </v>

827
00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:41.841
<v Speaker 2>personalities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>change musical directions to reinfuse </v>

828
00:34:41.841 --> 00:34:46.040
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it worked up until a point until my </v>

829
00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:48.870
<v Speaker 2>mother died,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in 96,</v>

830
00:34:49.660 --> 00:34:50.340
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>

831
00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:52.920
<v Speaker 2>in a weird three month period.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The drummer left the band,</v>

832
00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:57.960
<v Speaker 2>my mother died and I got a divorce in </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a six month period.</v>

833
00:34:58.650 --> 00:35:03.650
<v Speaker 2>And so I try to use that as fuel to sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of pivot where I wanted to go musically.</v>

834
00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:07.890
<v Speaker 2>But I wrote this very introspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dark record,</v>

835
00:35:07.891 --> 00:35:12.891
<v Speaker 2>which a lot of people really like now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But at the time it was like so </v>

836
00:35:12.891 --> 00:35:15.630
<v Speaker 2>antithetical to this big rock scene.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

837
00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:20.900
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was castigated for being an </v>

838
00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:20.900
<v Speaker 2>idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I went from golden child to idiot,</v>

839
00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:21.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in one fell swoop.</v>

840
00:35:21.931 --> 00:35:22.110
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

841
00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:28.320
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so many great artists are a prisoner of </v>

842
00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:28.900
<v Speaker 1>the early success and rightly so.</v>

843
00:35:29.050 --> 00:35:29.730
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

844
00:35:29.731 --> 00:35:33.220
<v Speaker 2>I have a much greater appreciation for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the zeitgeists effect of the public.</v>

845
00:35:34.530 --> 00:35:36.070
<v Speaker 2>Don't know if that makes any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

846
00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:39.090
<v Speaker 2>it's like how many.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like guys,</v>

847
00:35:39.091 --> 00:35:42.690
<v Speaker 2>did Elvis have three youtubes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had two or three.</v>

848
00:35:42.691 --> 00:35:45.270
<v Speaker 2>Frank Sinatra had two or three or four.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

849
00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:48.000
<v Speaker 2>there's something about when it all </v>
<v Speaker 2>seems to make sense,</v>

850
00:35:48.001 --> 00:35:53.001
<v Speaker 2>like the public fascination,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the artists place in time that work </v>

851
00:35:53.001 --> 00:35:56.160
<v Speaker 2>that's being created.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a sense of like familiarity,</v>

852
00:35:56.161 --> 00:36:01.161
<v Speaker 2>but also something is happening and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody wants to take part in it and </v>

853
00:36:01.161 --> 00:36:02.070
<v Speaker 2>so I have a much greater appreciation </v>
<v Speaker 2>for that moment.</v>

854
00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:07.500
<v Speaker 2>The Ego of the artist wants to Vince </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself that you're always in that </v>

855
00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:10.500
<v Speaker 2>moment and that's just impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just impossible.</v>

856
00:36:10.530 --> 00:36:15.530
<v Speaker 2>There's just no way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just the cyclical nature of </v>

857
00:36:15.530 --> 00:36:18.201
<v Speaker 2>creation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's such an important thing to say </v>

858
00:36:18.201 --> 00:36:21.560
<v Speaker 2>for people listening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for people that struggle with this </v>

859
00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:21.560
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>

860
00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:22.740
<v Speaker 2>Here's something like you say that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

861
00:36:22.741 --> 00:36:24.570
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's actually kind of makes sense.</v>

862
00:36:24.571 --> 00:36:25.440
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

863
00:36:25.590 --> 00:36:30.590
<v Speaker 2>it's like a typical example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like falling in love and expecting </v>

864
00:36:30.590 --> 00:36:32.850
<v Speaker 2>to feel that feeling forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just not gonna happen.</v>

865
00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:34.890
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to feel the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

866
00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:36.810
<v Speaker 2>I would argue if you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something wrong,</v>

867
00:36:36.850 --> 00:36:41.850
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You haven't matured into a deeper </v>

868
00:36:41.850 --> 00:36:45.681
<v Speaker 2>relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so in the same thing an artist needs to </v>

869
00:36:45.681 --> 00:36:48.110
<v Speaker 2>mature into a deeper relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 2>their work or their relationship with </v>

870
00:36:48.110 --> 00:36:48.110
<v Speaker 2>the public or their relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>

871
00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:50.910
<v Speaker 2>And if you can do that and you look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>great examples.</v>

872
00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:52.890
<v Speaker 2>Johnny cash,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Neil Young,</v>

873
00:36:52.891 --> 00:36:56.850
<v Speaker 2>Tom Petty when they get there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody comes back,</v>

874
00:36:56.910 --> 00:36:58.470
<v Speaker 2>Bob Dylan because they think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

875
00:36:58.770 --> 00:37:00.510
<v Speaker 2>now you're giving me some new </v>
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>

876
00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:03.810
<v Speaker 2>This isn't just a riff on the thing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gave me before.</v>

877
00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:09.260
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think the public has shown over </v>

878
00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:09.990
<v Speaker 2>time the willingness and the ability to </v>
<v Speaker 2>follow artists if they're willing,</v>

879
00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:15.130
<v Speaker 2>if they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they're able to go to that place </v>

880
00:37:15.130 --> 00:37:15.990
<v Speaker 2>where they might not something new that </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually is like a cultural contribution</v>

881
00:37:15.991 --> 00:37:17.850
<v Speaker 2>and not just sort of more of what they </v>
<v Speaker 2>already know.</v>

882
00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:20.370
<v Speaker 2>I think that's so important for you to </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about it.</v>

883
00:37:20.371 --> 00:37:25.371
<v Speaker 2>I'm so glad you do because for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>upcoming artists and in all sorts of </v>

884
00:37:25.590 --> 00:37:30.590
<v Speaker 2>genres,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just people who were involved in </v>

885
00:37:30.590 --> 00:37:31.110
<v Speaker 2>creating the here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone as successful as yourself,</v>

886
00:37:31.111 --> 00:37:33.850
<v Speaker 2>talk about the various struggles of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mind and,</v>

887
00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:36.200
<v Speaker 2>and have momentum and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

888
00:37:36.210 --> 00:37:39.090
<v Speaker 2>the different stages and various points </v>
<v Speaker 2>of your career.</v>

889
00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:40.440
<v Speaker 2>So important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

890
00:37:40.441 --> 00:37:45.441
<v Speaker 2>The music meant his business plays this </v>
<v Speaker 2>jet I mind trick on you where the whole </v>

891
00:37:45.441 --> 00:37:48.390
<v Speaker 2>thing set up to be patient and take </v>
<v Speaker 2>advantage of your weakness.</v>

892
00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:50.370
<v Speaker 2>How so?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

893
00:37:51.210 --> 00:37:52.330
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

894
00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:53.190
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can use,</v>

895
00:37:53.210 --> 00:37:58.210
<v Speaker 2>I'll use the music businesses and </v>
<v Speaker 2>example and I'm sure there's plenty of </v>

896
00:37:58.210 --> 00:37:58.210
<v Speaker 2>parallels across the entertainment </v>
<v Speaker 2>spectrum.</v>

897
00:37:58.210 --> 00:37:58.660
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

898
00:37:58.950 --> 00:37:59.640
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

899
00:37:59.641 --> 00:38:02.790
<v Speaker 2>you struggled to get the contract and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then the contract is sort of,</v>

900
00:38:02.850 --> 00:38:07.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the indirect indentured servitude type </v>

901
00:38:07.850 --> 00:38:07.850
<v Speaker 2>of thing.</v>

902
00:38:07.850 --> 00:38:08.100
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our first contract was seven albums,</v>

903
00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:13.380
<v Speaker 2>essentially 14 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I signed that contract when I was 23.</v>

904
00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:14.520
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

905
00:38:14.521 --> 00:38:19.521
<v Speaker 2>So I'm signing a 23 years old and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>signed a contract that's supposed to </v>

906
00:38:19.521 --> 00:38:22.431
<v Speaker 2>take me into 37.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd signing a contract for more than </v>

907
00:38:22.431 --> 00:38:25.440
<v Speaker 2>half your life and if you look at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>shelf life of most artists,</v>

908
00:38:25.441 --> 00:38:30.441
<v Speaker 2>it's for to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're basically anticipating your </v>

909
00:38:30.441 --> 00:38:31.470
<v Speaker 2>entire arc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's so crazy.</v>

910
00:38:31.471 --> 00:38:33.570
<v Speaker 2>You don't have any leverage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

911
00:38:33.571 --> 00:38:35.070
<v Speaker 2>other than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to sign you.</v>

912
00:38:35.110 --> 00:38:38.740
<v Speaker 2>He signed the deal and then it becomes </v>
<v Speaker 2>this weird dance of like,</v>

913
00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:41.420
<v Speaker 2>can I sustain success?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

914
00:38:42.010 --> 00:38:44.140
<v Speaker 2>If you get success and you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>leveraged,</v>

915
00:38:44.141 --> 00:38:46.210
<v Speaker 2>they'll get out of your way because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're making them a lot of money,</v>

916
00:38:46.211 --> 00:38:48.370
<v Speaker 2>but the minute you're not making them as</v>
<v Speaker 2>much money,</v>

917
00:38:48.550 --> 00:38:51.370
<v Speaker 2>then they step in and they start playing</v>
<v Speaker 2>these Jedi mind tricks on you.</v>

918
00:38:51.970 --> 00:38:56.970
<v Speaker 2>We know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you know the public's gonna </v>

919
00:38:56.970 --> 00:38:56.970
<v Speaker 2>forget about you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

920
00:38:56.970 --> 00:38:58.030
<v Speaker 2>I've heard all these things like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

921
00:38:58.031 --> 00:38:59.740
<v Speaker 2>this kind of weird like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

922
00:38:59.741 --> 00:39:01.570
<v Speaker 2>you're in the room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

923
00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:04.270
<v Speaker 2>we're the arbiter of whether you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>stay in the room.</v>

924
00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:10.390
<v Speaker 3>That's the weird position that record </v>
<v Speaker 3>companies had for a long time that they </v>

925
00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:10.390
<v Speaker 3>don't seem to have anymore.</v>

926
00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:15.130
<v Speaker 2>My wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would argue against that because they </v>

927
00:39:15.130 --> 00:39:16.971
<v Speaker 2>will do well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've moved to a different set of </v>

928
00:39:16.971 --> 00:39:17.260
<v Speaker 2>circumstances and I'm not as conversant </v>
<v Speaker 2>as I as I once was,</v>

929
00:39:17.261 --> 00:39:20.530
<v Speaker 2>but one thing they do with certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>younger artists,</v>

930
00:39:20.531 --> 00:39:25.531
<v Speaker 2>but I think particularly more in the pop</v>
<v Speaker 2>realm as they do these three 60 deals </v>

931
00:39:25.531 --> 00:39:25.810
<v Speaker 2>where it's like if you get a perfume </v>
<v Speaker 2>deal,</v>

932
00:39:25.811 --> 00:39:30.640
<v Speaker 2>if you like your whole world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we owned a piece of your whole world and</v>

933
00:39:30.641 --> 00:39:33.430
<v Speaker 2>famous such a great quotion in American </v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

934
00:39:33.431 --> 00:39:38.431
<v Speaker 2>Now that you can see where kids would </v>
<v Speaker 2>trade fame and give and be willing to </v>

935
00:39:38.431 --> 00:39:40.840
<v Speaker 2>give away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the the profit part will.</v>

936
00:39:40.841 --> 00:39:41.920
<v Speaker 2>They'll take a risk</v>

937
00:39:41.970 --> 00:39:44.640
<v Speaker 3>at the long term ownership.</v>

938
00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:46.040
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let me jump in there.</v>

939
00:39:46.370 --> 00:39:49.610
<v Speaker 2>So if you actually survived the cut,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

940
00:39:49.611 --> 00:39:52.040
<v Speaker 2>let's call it phase one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're successful,</v>

941
00:39:52.041 --> 00:39:55.490
<v Speaker 2>you're a name and now you're in a place </v>
<v Speaker 2>to either renegotiate or your deal is up</v>

942
00:39:55.491 --> 00:40:00.491
<v Speaker 2>or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I once had a conversation with a very </v>

943
00:40:00.491 --> 00:40:00.890
<v Speaker 2>powerful music executive and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was friends with the guy,</v>

944
00:40:00.891 --> 00:40:03.650
<v Speaker 2>so I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give me the insider psychology here.</v>

945
00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:10.180
<v Speaker 2>Now that I know the game that you run,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you tell people like me when </v>

946
00:40:10.281 --> 00:40:12.920
<v Speaker 2>they get here and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

947
00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:14.690
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's always a price.</v>

948
00:40:15.530 --> 00:40:20.530
<v Speaker 2>So they know that even if you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>through the matrix of the whole thing </v>

949
00:40:20.530 --> 00:40:23.920
<v Speaker 2>and get off the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's just a dollar amount that </v>

950
00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:23.920
<v Speaker 2>will buy you back in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

951
00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:25.130
<v Speaker 2>They're not worried that you'll go </v>
<v Speaker 2>independent.</v>

952
00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:30.670
<v Speaker 2>And in fact if you look at a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>machinations of the music business over </v>

953
00:40:30.670 --> 00:40:33.731
<v Speaker 2>the last 20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially with the rise of the </v>

954
00:40:33.731 --> 00:40:35.801
<v Speaker 2>Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's to keep people in the system yet </v>

955
00:40:35.801 --> 00:40:36.050
<v Speaker 2>they don't want true independence.</v>

956
00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:39.160
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it seems like,</v>

957
00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:41.270
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you a look no further than the</v>

958
00:40:41.271 --> 00:40:44.630
<v Speaker 2>deals that the record labels cut with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the streaming services.</v>

959
00:40:45.110 --> 00:40:49.110
<v Speaker 2>They got into ownership equity deals </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the streaming services in an,</v>

960
00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:54.220
<v Speaker 2>in an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in an arrangement for them to have an </v>

961
00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:56.141
<v Speaker 2>equity position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They agreed to very low rates for the </v>

962
00:40:56.141 --> 00:40:56.141
<v Speaker 2>artist's music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

963
00:40:56.141 --> 00:40:56.840
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so when you,</v>

964
00:40:56.870 --> 00:41:01.040
<v Speaker 2>when you listen to Bob Dylan Song on </v>
<v Speaker 2>spotify,</v>

965
00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:03.560
<v Speaker 2>Bob Dylan's not getting a lot of money </v>
<v Speaker 2>for that,</v>

966
00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:09.280
<v Speaker 2>but as spotify and the other streaming </v>
<v Speaker 2>services raise up in their equity </v>

967
00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:09.650
<v Speaker 2>position,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the labels benefit.</v>

968
00:41:09.950 --> 00:41:14.950
<v Speaker 2>So the labels pimped out their own </v>
<v Speaker 2>artists to take a greater equity </v>

969
00:41:15.141 --> 00:41:17.030
<v Speaker 2>position in a rising business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

970
00:41:17.570 --> 00:41:18.860
<v Speaker 2>you see what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

971
00:41:18.861 --> 00:41:23.861
<v Speaker 2>They weakened the artist's position to </v>
<v Speaker 2>take a better position at the table </v>

972
00:41:23.861 --> 00:41:23.861
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>

973
00:41:23.861 --> 00:41:24.150
<v Speaker 3>That is fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they,</v>

974
00:41:24.151 --> 00:41:29.151
<v Speaker 3>they weakened the monetary position of </v>
<v Speaker 3>compensation in order to get equity in </v>

975
00:41:29.151 --> 00:41:29.410
<v Speaker 3>the company.</v>

976
00:41:29.540 --> 00:41:30.220
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now,</v>

977
00:41:30.330 --> 00:41:34.490
<v Speaker 2>and now you see it where a metallica's </v>
<v Speaker 2>management for example,</v>

978
00:41:34.491 --> 00:41:35.360
<v Speaker 2>has come out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

979
00:41:35.530 --> 00:41:35.800
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

980
00:41:36.110 --> 00:41:36.880
<v Speaker 2>especially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

981
00:41:36.990 --> 00:41:39.260
<v Speaker 2>Youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 2>former manager Paul mcguinness come out,</v>

982
00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:43.700
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to take on youtube now </v>
<v Speaker 2>because youtube has got this weird funky</v>

983
00:41:43.701 --> 00:41:48.200
<v Speaker 2>position where they'll pay on licensed </v>
<v Speaker 2>music but they won't pay for covers.</v>

984
00:41:48.201 --> 00:41:50.630
<v Speaker 2>And you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Youtube.</v>

985
00:41:50.631 --> 00:41:52.340
<v Speaker 2>So like one of the big targets of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>business,</v>

986
00:41:52.341 --> 00:41:56.420
<v Speaker 2>because whatever deal they agreed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>with youtube 10 years ago is super weak.</v>

987
00:41:56.421 --> 00:41:57.350
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>

988
00:41:57.351 --> 00:42:02.351
<v Speaker 2>these are all machinations that go on </v>
<v Speaker 2>above the artists spot and quick thing </v>

989
00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:04.220
<v Speaker 2>into your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into your world.</v>

990
00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:09.410
<v Speaker 2>When Mcgregor leaped out and did the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight with mayweather,</v>

991
00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:13.210
<v Speaker 2>he creates this whole different set of </v>
<v Speaker 2>dynamics because he's,</v>

992
00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:14.870
<v Speaker 2>he can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he can run his own game.</v>

993
00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:16.790
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>UFC can't pay him.</v>

994
00:42:16.791 --> 00:42:21.791
<v Speaker 2>That kind of money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And last I heard is like maybe it's </v>

995
00:42:21.791 --> 00:42:21.791
<v Speaker 2>going to do another fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not,</v>

996
00:42:21.791 --> 00:42:26.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to get totally into that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But my point is as you see where those </v>

997
00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:26.300
<v Speaker 2>dynamics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where people step outside the system,</v>

998
00:42:26.301 --> 00:42:28.820
<v Speaker 2>it changes the game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's actually kind of,</v>

999
00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:30.560
<v Speaker 2>you could now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

1000
00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:31.720
<v Speaker 2>and I don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1001
00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:36.840
<v Speaker 2>I've never met Dana White,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if Dana white could go back in a </v>

1002
00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:36.840
<v Speaker 2>time machine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe he'd pay mayweather,</v>

1003
00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:40.820
<v Speaker 2>Mcgregor more money to keep them in his </v>
<v Speaker 2>world because now that he's out,</v>

1004
00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:43.770
<v Speaker 3>I don't think connor would have accepted</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1005
00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:45.170
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>

1006
00:42:45.220 --> 00:42:48.090
<v Speaker 3>you recognize the unique opportunity </v>
<v Speaker 3>that he's in.</v>

1007
00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:51.060
<v Speaker 3>So he probably wasn't any upon talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about stuff as a fan,</v>

1008
00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:53.180
<v Speaker 2>the other side of fence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But my point is,</v>

1009
00:42:53.181 --> 00:42:56.080
<v Speaker 2>is when you see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when somebody breaks out of this sort of</v>

1010
00:42:56.081 --> 00:42:58.810
<v Speaker 2>the matrix of how the game is set up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1011
00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:01.290
<v Speaker 2>it creates this weird thing.</v>

1012
00:43:01.830 --> 00:43:06.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they have a few today though that </v>

1013
00:43:06.830 --> 00:43:08.631
<v Speaker 3>have kind of figured it out through </v>
<v Speaker 3>youtube and all these different online </v>

1014
00:43:08.631 --> 00:43:08.631
<v Speaker 3>chance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The rapper,</v>

1015
00:43:08.631 --> 00:43:12.861
<v Speaker 3>I don't know much about his business,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I know he's sort of worked out this </v>

1016
00:43:12.861 --> 00:43:14.080
<v Speaker 3>other model for himself that Jamie knows</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot about them.</v>

1017
00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:19.030
<v Speaker 3>I know he's getting money from a way </v>
<v Speaker 3>other places than just the traditional a</v>

1018
00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:24.260
<v Speaker 3>record contract.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Big deals from major companies like </v>

1019
00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:24.260
<v Speaker 3>sprite another and he's still </v>
<v Speaker 3>independent,</v>

1020
00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:26.250
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tech technical word.</v>

1021
00:43:26.251 --> 00:43:28.350
<v Speaker 3>They would use to monitor him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he's an independent artist,</v>

1022
00:43:28.351 --> 00:43:31.020
<v Speaker 3>but he's got a Michigan behind them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I don't know if he's independent,</v>

1023
00:43:31.021 --> 00:43:36.021
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm good friends with Sturgill Simpson </v>

1024
00:43:36.021 --> 00:43:38.541
<v Speaker 3>and sturgeons tried to educate me as to </v>
<v Speaker 3>how the record business people in,</v>

1025
00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:44.100
<v Speaker 3>in the fold with the owning your </v>
<v Speaker 3>merchandise and your likeness forever </v>

1026
00:43:45.631 --> 00:43:47.070
<v Speaker 3>and all these different things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems.</v>

1027
00:43:48.030 --> 00:43:50.070
<v Speaker 3>It seems crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We actually,</v>

1028
00:43:50.260 --> 00:43:53.520
<v Speaker 2>we actually signed a clause.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

1029
00:43:53.590 --> 00:43:58.590
<v Speaker 2>It said in this contract pertains to </v>
<v Speaker 2>this universe in any universe,</v>

1030
00:43:59.711 --> 00:44:00.730
<v Speaker 2>not yet discovered.</v>

1031
00:44:02.190 --> 00:44:06.680
<v Speaker 3>What would we signed that clause?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who wrote that?</v>

1032
00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:09.620
<v Speaker 3>The record company.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus fucking what do they scientology.</v>

1033
00:44:09.830 --> 00:44:12.050
<v Speaker 3>That is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we literally had a sign</v>

1034
00:44:12.130 --> 00:44:17.130
<v Speaker 2>thinking it was like this contract </v>
<v Speaker 2>pertains to this known universe and any </v>

1035
00:44:17.130 --> 00:44:17.580
<v Speaker 2>universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not yet.</v>

1036
00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:17.580
<v Speaker 2>I</v>

1037
00:44:17.610 --> 00:44:21.080
<v Speaker 3>discovered that is fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is insane.</v>

1038
00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:26.200
<v Speaker 3>Like if someone found a parallel </v>
<v Speaker 3>universe somewhere and they figured out </v>

1039
00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:26.820
<v Speaker 3>they could sell music to them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's apparel.</v>

1040
00:44:27.310 --> 00:44:31.620
<v Speaker 3>They haven't heard the smashing pumpkins</v>
<v Speaker 3>get over there quick shoot a rocket ship</v>

1041
00:44:31.621 --> 00:44:32.370
<v Speaker 3>filled with cash</v>

1042
00:44:32.370 --> 00:44:33.330
<v Speaker 2>over there that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1043
00:44:33.331 --> 00:44:36.270
<v Speaker 2>why they put that in is because the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

1044
00:44:36.330 --> 00:44:41.330
<v Speaker 2>when they transitioned to cds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the contracts didn't account for cds and</v>

1045
00:44:43.021 --> 00:44:44.320
<v Speaker 2>what they did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a very uh,</v>

1046
00:44:44.321 --> 00:44:49.321
<v Speaker 2>it's a very classic thing is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they had to go back and renegotiate </v>

1047
00:44:49.321 --> 00:44:51.210
<v Speaker 2>all the deals because of the CT </v>
<v Speaker 2>technology.</v>

1048
00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:52.590
<v Speaker 2>This would have been like whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eighties.</v>

1049
00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:54.690
<v Speaker 2>So they went to every artist and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

1050
00:44:54.691 --> 00:44:56.180
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's this new technology,</v>

1051
00:44:56.210 --> 00:44:59.700
<v Speaker 2>we're not sure it's going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you've got to take a price cut.</v>

1052
00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:05.780
<v Speaker 2>We're only going to pay you seventy five</v>
<v Speaker 2>cents on the dollar so we could advance </v>

1053
00:45:05.780 --> 00:45:06.240
<v Speaker 2>the new technology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Jesus Christ.</v>

1054
00:45:06.241 --> 00:45:08.370
<v Speaker 2>They're dirty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're dirty.</v>

1055
00:45:08.371 --> 00:45:09.840
<v Speaker 2>The spotify thing is dirty.</v>

1056
00:45:10.430 --> 00:45:12.770
<v Speaker 3>The uncomfortable hearing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how they weaseled that,</v>

1057
00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:15.710
<v Speaker 3>how they negotiated cheap prices for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>performers.</v>

1058
00:45:15.711 --> 00:45:20.711
<v Speaker 3>Then they got an equity position in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>company so as the company grows because </v>

1059
00:45:20.711 --> 00:45:20.900
<v Speaker 3>they don't have to pay much and they get</v>
<v Speaker 3>all this music,</v>

1060
00:45:20.901 --> 00:45:23.720
<v Speaker 3>they get money from that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is sneaky.</v>

1061
00:45:23.930 --> 00:45:25.240
<v Speaker 3>Dark fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1062
00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:27.170
<v Speaker 3>three d chess shake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>game of thrones,</v>

1063
00:45:27.171 --> 00:45:29.180
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is game of thrones,</v>

1064
00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:32.020
<v Speaker 3>but I mean obviously it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an,</v>

1065
00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:35.210
<v Speaker 3>it's an organism surviving in the face </v>
<v Speaker 3>of Napster,</v>

1066
00:45:35.211 --> 00:45:36.590
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like napster comes in,</v>

1067
00:45:36.591 --> 00:45:39.320
<v Speaker 3>file sharing comes in and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

1068
00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:44.470
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the Internet is just out there wild </v>

1069
00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:44.470
<v Speaker 3>and free and you can just download the </v>
<v Speaker 3>music.</v>

1070
00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:48.581
<v Speaker 3>That music is now digital.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can't control it and it's just going </v>

1071
00:45:48.581 --> 00:45:52.250
<v Speaker 3>and it drives some people crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had Paul Stanley in here and you can </v>

1072
00:45:52.250 --> 00:45:55.301
<v Speaker 3>see the fucking anger in his face when </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's talking about people stealing </v>

1073
00:45:55.301 --> 00:45:55.301
<v Speaker 3>music.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1074
00:45:55.301 --> 00:45:55.310
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1075
00:45:55.410 --> 00:46:00.410
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was one of the first people that came </v>

1076
00:46:00.410 --> 00:46:01.921
<v Speaker 2>out for napster because I thought the </v>
<v Speaker 2>music business shit get in bed with </v>

1077
00:46:01.921 --> 00:46:02.800
<v Speaker 2>napster and Ssa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let the monster grow.</v>

1078
00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:04.750
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought they should've brought napster</v>

1079
00:46:04.751 --> 00:46:08.020
<v Speaker 2>and house and made it like a given them </v>
<v Speaker 2>a per whatever.</v>

1080
00:46:08.070 --> 00:46:10.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean if you want to be technical,</v>

1081
00:46:10.451 --> 00:46:14.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean the thing I helped support,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it probably costs me $30,</v>

1082
00:46:14.891 --> 00:46:16.210
<v Speaker 2>million,</v>
<v Speaker 2>$40,000,000.</v>

1083
00:46:17.110 --> 00:46:18.500
<v Speaker 2>Napster did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1084
00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:19.810
<v Speaker 2>that whole world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1085
00:46:20.140 --> 00:46:21.010
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1086
00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:23.320
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine.</v>

1087
00:46:23.321 --> 00:46:24.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not here to bitch.</v>

1088
00:46:24.731 --> 00:46:27.310
<v Speaker 2>It's like the world went on and I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 2>the only person,</v>

1089
00:46:27.311 --> 00:46:30.580
<v Speaker 2>you know what I'm saying wasn't targeted</v>
<v Speaker 2>at me and I supported it,</v>

1090
00:46:30.581 --> 00:46:31.930
<v Speaker 2>so I got nothing to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean,</v>

1091
00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:34.510
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at some point when you can't pay your,</v>

1092
00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:39.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your stupid mortgage on your fifth </v>

1093
00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:39.900
<v Speaker 2>property,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1094
00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:39.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sad to Disneyland,</v>

1095
00:46:39.971 --> 00:46:41.020
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1096
00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:45.010
<v Speaker 2>I wish I had that money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a weird dynamic of,</v>

1097
00:46:45.330 --> 00:46:47.290
<v Speaker 3>of the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

1098
00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:51.720
<v Speaker 3>of the free access of information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when a song,</v>

1099
00:46:52.110 --> 00:46:54.690
<v Speaker 3>it's your creation can be boiled down to</v>
<v Speaker 3>information.</v>

1100
00:46:54.691 --> 00:46:59.691
<v Speaker 3>It's not that much different than </v>
<v Speaker 3>forwarding an email in terms of </v>

1101
00:46:59.691 --> 00:46:59.691
<v Speaker 3>people's.</v>

1102
00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:05.280
<v Speaker 2>The reason I support it in the beginning</v>
<v Speaker 2>was I thought that the free association </v>

1103
00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:09.781
<v Speaker 2>with music would create a more holistic </v>
<v Speaker 2>fans finding what they want and that we </v>

1104
00:47:12.311 --> 00:47:16.000
<v Speaker 2>would do well in that ecosystem that </v>
<v Speaker 2>turned out not to be the case.</v>

1105
00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:18.140
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

1106
00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:21.850
<v Speaker 2>I think now that it is sort of set up in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the streaming service world,</v>

1107
00:47:22.210 --> 00:47:27.210
<v Speaker 2>now that's starting to be the case </v>
<v Speaker 2>because people are finding us because </v>

1108
00:47:27.210 --> 00:47:27.550
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of organized and they're sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of institutional culture.</v>

1109
00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:30.070
<v Speaker 2>But when it was free wielding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1110
00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:32.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we played the game well </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough to take advantage of it.</v>

1111
00:47:32.891 --> 00:47:35.140
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of trains just passed us by.</v>

1112
00:47:35.530 --> 00:47:40.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a lot of argument that people </v>

1113
00:47:40.530 --> 00:47:42.091
<v Speaker 3>would find new music because of that in </v>
<v Speaker 3>a way that they would have never found </v>

1114
00:47:42.091 --> 00:47:46.040
<v Speaker 3>if the record companies and the radio </v>
<v Speaker 3>stations had a lock down on what got </v>

1115
00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:46.040
<v Speaker 3>district.</v>

1116
00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:50.640
<v Speaker 2>Somebody did a study.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's my one piece of empirical evidence </v>

1117
00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:53.440
<v Speaker 2>like the British,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the British Association of something,</v>

1118
00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:58.680
<v Speaker 2>when it first became a real issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did a study about people's fidelity to </v>

1119
00:47:59.681 --> 00:48:04.681
<v Speaker 2>artists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether they got something for free or </v>

1120
00:48:04.681 --> 00:48:08.401
<v Speaker 2>they paid for it and they found the </v>
<v Speaker 2>loyalty was literally know if they got </v>

1121
00:48:08.401 --> 00:48:13.381
<v Speaker 2>it for free,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the actual act of purchasing </v>

1122
00:48:13.381 --> 00:48:17.461
<v Speaker 2>something created a relationship that </v>
<v Speaker 2>then created a sort of a desire to want </v>

1123
00:48:18.791 --> 00:48:21.490
<v Speaker 2>to prove that the relationship was </v>
<v Speaker 2>profitable.</v>

1124
00:48:21.491 --> 00:48:25.570
<v Speaker 2>In essence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I buy your your comedy concert.</v>

1125
00:48:25.930 --> 00:48:30.930
<v Speaker 2>I didn't get it for free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes me actually assess whether or </v>

1126
00:48:30.930 --> 00:48:33.961
<v Speaker 2>not my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My thing was a good investment and if </v>

1127
00:48:33.961 --> 00:48:37.141
<v Speaker 2>you prove to me it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I become more loyal to you because now </v>

1128
00:48:37.141 --> 00:48:37.141
<v Speaker 2>we're in a relationship.</v>

1129
00:48:37.141 --> 00:48:37.760
<v Speaker 3>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1130
00:48:37.761 --> 00:48:40.520
<v Speaker 3>Like you want to justify your purchase.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It also makes sense.</v>

1131
00:48:40.521 --> 00:48:45.521
<v Speaker 3>Like when I was coming up and we do </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy clubs and they would pay for the </v>

1132
00:48:45.521 --> 00:48:46.910
<v Speaker 3>room and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a giveaway free tickets.</v>

1133
00:48:46.940 --> 00:48:47.450
<v Speaker 3>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1134
00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:49.910
<v Speaker 3>Audiences were terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were terrible.</v>

1135
00:48:50.180 --> 00:48:52.700
<v Speaker 3>You would think that people would be </v>
<v Speaker 3>thankful they got a free show.</v>

1136
00:48:52.730 --> 00:48:54.080
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were the worst.</v>

1137
00:48:54.230 --> 00:48:59.230
<v Speaker 3>Most unappreciative audiences because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't have anything invested in </v>

1138
00:48:59.230 --> 00:48:59.230
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

1139
00:48:59.230 --> 00:49:01.070
<v Speaker 3>It totally makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you saw it coming,</v>

1140
00:49:01.100 --> 00:49:03.740
<v Speaker 3>you saw napster coming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you looked at it and you were like,</v>

1141
00:49:03.850 --> 00:49:08.600
<v Speaker 3>this is something that is inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We should probably figure out a way to</v>

1142
00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:09.810
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1143
00:49:09.811 --> 00:49:13.470
<v Speaker 2>there's some piece of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a piece of video me from like 99</v>

1144
00:49:13.500 --> 00:49:15.870
<v Speaker 2>where I say the future of music is </v>
<v Speaker 2>streaming.</v>

1145
00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:18.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Damn,</v>

1146
00:49:18.171 --> 00:49:18.560
<v Speaker 3>you called it.</v>

1147
00:49:18.570 --> 00:49:20.730
<v Speaker 2>They put me in some documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen it,</v>

1148
00:49:20.731 --> 00:49:21.600
<v Speaker 2>but I've heard about it.</v>

1149
00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:24.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always wondered like,</v>

1150
00:49:24.371 --> 00:49:26.860
<v Speaker 3>we're not on spotify or would this </v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast,</v>

1151
00:49:26.861 --> 00:49:29.560
<v Speaker 3>but they have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have podcasts on it,</v>

1152
00:49:29.561 --> 00:49:30.040
<v Speaker 3>but I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1153
00:49:30.041 --> 00:49:31.990
<v Speaker 3>where's the money?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where's it going?</v>

1154
00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:34.030
<v Speaker 3>Like you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want me to be on.</v>

1155
00:49:34.210 --> 00:49:35.350
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But where's,</v>

1156
00:49:35.650 --> 00:49:36.310
<v Speaker 3>where's it going?</v>

1157
00:49:36.570 --> 00:49:37.070
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

1158
00:49:37.350 --> 00:49:41.760
<v Speaker 2>And I usually using Amazon example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember for years the wrap on Amazon,</v>

1159
00:49:41.761 --> 00:49:46.761
<v Speaker 2>was there not a profitable business?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody could understand because it was </v>

1160
00:49:46.761 --> 00:49:48.600
<v Speaker 2>this new model will now you understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>that that business model is about,</v>

1161
00:49:48.930 --> 00:49:51.510
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a growing the brand value.</v>

1162
00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:53.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1163
00:49:54.110 --> 00:49:56.820
<v Speaker 2>in essence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you grow the brand value your,</v>

1164
00:49:56.821 --> 00:49:58.900
<v Speaker 2>your net worth as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a brand.</v>

1165
00:49:58.901 --> 00:50:01.200
<v Speaker 2>It far outpaces whether or not you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>profitable.</v>

1166
00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:03.690
<v Speaker 2>Hm?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does it make sense?</v>

1167
00:50:03.691 --> 00:50:04.470
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does.</v>

1168
00:50:04.860 --> 00:50:08.640
<v Speaker 2>So that's part of my argument now with </v>
<v Speaker 2>music is the brand,</v>

1169
00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:14.000
<v Speaker 2>and I use my brand smashing pumpkins or </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Nwa is far more valuable than my </v>

1170
00:50:14.761 --> 00:50:19.761
<v Speaker 2>sort of profit loss on paper in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world of the open market.</v>

1171
00:50:21.630 --> 00:50:26.630
<v Speaker 2>And so as long as you appreciate that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you won't let people come along and gut </v>

1172
00:50:26.630 --> 00:50:28.160
<v Speaker 2>out your brand value.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a fascinating of looking at it.</v>

1173
00:50:28.730 --> 00:50:31.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't think very many musicians </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably no,</v>

1174
00:50:31.311 --> 00:50:36.311
<v Speaker 2>because they're were surrounded by </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who are telling them it's a </v>

1175
00:50:36.311 --> 00:50:37.710
<v Speaker 2>profit loss business full well knowing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would argue that they,</v>

1176
00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:40.730
<v Speaker 2>they kind of know deep down to really </v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't like a.</v>

1177
00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:42.890
<v Speaker 2>let's use a good positive example right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

1178
00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:48.460
<v Speaker 2>Gnr reformed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know duff and an excellent slash are</v>

1179
00:50:48.921 --> 00:50:53.921
<v Speaker 2>out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just saw them at Madison Square </v>

1180
00:50:53.921 --> 00:50:55.870
<v Speaker 2>Garden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's proving to be a very </v>

1181
00:50:55.870 --> 00:50:57.641
<v Speaker 2>durable brand right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could argue how many wrecker,</v>

1182
00:50:58.061 --> 00:51:00.770
<v Speaker 2>if nobody cares anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a durable brand.</v>

1183
00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:04.850
<v Speaker 2>The GNR brand or the Harley Davidson </v>
<v Speaker 2>brand or the Joe Rogan brand,</v>

1184
00:51:04.851 --> 00:51:09.851
<v Speaker 2>those are durable brands that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are worth far more than you could </v>

1185
00:51:09.851 --> 00:51:09.851
<v Speaker 2>sort of prove on paper.</v>

1186
00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:13.680
<v Speaker 3>The GNR ones is fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One to me because actually just went off</v>

1187
00:51:13.681 --> 00:51:15.870
<v Speaker 3>the rails and into the woods for so </v>
<v Speaker 3>long,</v>

1188
00:51:16.530 --> 00:51:19.920
<v Speaker 3>shooting his face up with a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit and it looks like he was just gone.</v>

1189
00:51:19.950 --> 00:51:21.690
<v Speaker 3>It looks like we lost him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mean to me,</v>

1190
00:51:21.691 --> 00:51:23.840
<v Speaker 3>you as a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guns and roses like.</v>

1191
00:51:24.300 --> 00:51:29.300
<v Speaker 3>I mean they were like welcome to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>jungle is like one of my all time </v>

1192
00:51:29.300 --> 00:51:30.420
<v Speaker 3>favorite songs and I was like 18 or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

1193
00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:32.070
<v Speaker 3>I old I was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When it came out,</v>

1194
00:51:32.071 --> 00:51:37.071
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then to see them just have this </v>

1195
00:51:37.071 --> 00:51:39.120
<v Speaker 3>incredible success and then actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>goes crazy.</v>

1196
00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:45.730
<v Speaker 2>But I would argue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't mean this in a disparaging </v>

1197
00:51:45.730 --> 00:51:48.581
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would argue that the freedom in axle </v>

1198
00:51:49.150 --> 00:51:52.760
<v Speaker 2>and the path that they took is added to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the brand.</v>

1199
00:51:53.390 --> 00:51:55.640
<v Speaker 2>I think so too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're back.</v>

1200
00:51:56.270 --> 00:51:59.510
<v Speaker 2>I would argue differently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that when you look,</v>

1201
00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:02.150
<v Speaker 2>and I'm speaking as a fan now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

1202
00:52:02.210 --> 00:52:03.980
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I look at acts rose,</v>

1203
00:52:04.010 --> 00:52:08.090
<v Speaker 2>ifc,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a free person that means more to me than</v>

1204
00:52:08.091 --> 00:52:10.970
<v Speaker 2>whether he did the right thing in 2000 </v>
<v Speaker 2>X.</v>

1205
00:52:11.540 --> 00:52:14.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm more interested in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a unique perspective.</v>

1206
00:52:14.540 --> 00:52:17.690
<v Speaker 2>So you liked the fact that he didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>give a fuck and he just went crazy.</v>

1207
00:52:17.691 --> 00:52:21.650
<v Speaker 2>I love that about axl rose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that about axl rose.</v>

1208
00:52:21.651 --> 00:52:24.030
<v Speaker 2>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't give two fucks about eight.</v>

1209
00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:27.050
<v Speaker 2>I think that's so fascinating because </v>
<v Speaker 2>there are true.</v>

1210
00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:32.200
<v Speaker 2>There are only a few American iconic </v>
<v Speaker 2>artists that are truly free.</v>

1211
00:52:32.550 --> 00:52:33.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the fact that,</v>

1212
00:52:33.891 --> 00:52:37.960
<v Speaker 2>so it was hunter Thompson Thompson free </v>
<v Speaker 2>or you know,</v>

1213
00:52:37.961 --> 00:52:40.130
<v Speaker 2>it's like we only have a few of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1214
00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:41.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Johnny cash.</v>

1215
00:52:41.510 --> 00:52:44.340
<v Speaker 2>Johnny cash had some weird bad years and</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1216
00:52:44.510 --> 00:52:46.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was every year of Johnny cash perfect.</v>

1217
00:52:46.761 --> 00:52:48.320
<v Speaker 2>Was every year of Neil Young.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perfect.</v>

1218
00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:52.130
<v Speaker 2>It's the sum total of what that person </v>
<v Speaker 2>represents.</v>

1219
00:52:52.460 --> 00:52:56.710
<v Speaker 2>That I think is the durability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we as fans,</v>

1220
00:52:56.720 --> 00:52:57.590
<v Speaker 2>we get into like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1221
00:52:57.591 --> 00:53:00.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't like the new song or it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that misses the mark.</v>

1222
00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:06.280
<v Speaker 2>There's only one guns n roses in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole world and I have fought mightily </v>

1223
00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:10.430
<v Speaker 2>internally to to protect what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>smashing pumpkins means.</v>

1224
00:53:10.460 --> 00:53:13.340
<v Speaker 2>I know it's not for everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's only one smashing pumpkins.</v>

1225
00:53:13.550 --> 00:53:18.550
<v Speaker 2>I know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew that as a kid and I got a little </v>

1226
00:53:18.550 --> 00:53:19.430
<v Speaker 2>lost in it and I've come out the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>side and I realized that protecting what</v>

1227
00:53:19.431 --> 00:53:24.140
<v Speaker 2>that brand is worth is is so much more </v>
<v Speaker 2>valuable than whether somebody liked one</v>

1228
00:53:24.141 --> 00:53:26.940
<v Speaker 2>song or one album or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said in 1992,</v>

1229
00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:28.740
<v Speaker 2>it's so inconsequential.</v>

1230
00:53:29.060 --> 00:53:34.060
<v Speaker 3>That's such a unique perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you look at Axel rose from the </v>

1231
00:53:34.060 --> 00:53:35.160
<v Speaker 3>point of view of being a fellow </v>
<v Speaker 3>performer to what I.</v>

1232
00:53:35.170 --> 00:53:37.300
<v Speaker 3>One of the things I really enjoy about </v>
<v Speaker 3>axl rose's.</v>

1233
00:53:37.310 --> 00:53:42.310
<v Speaker 3>I love comebacks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love when someone fucks their life up </v>

1234
00:53:42.310 --> 00:53:42.770
<v Speaker 3>and then just brings it right back </v>
<v Speaker 3>around.</v>

1235
00:53:43.010 --> 00:53:44.150
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a good fight,</v>

1236
00:53:44.151 --> 00:53:49.151
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's like every success stories </v>

1237
00:53:49.151 --> 00:53:49.151
<v Speaker 3>are awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Love them,</v>

1238
00:53:49.151 --> 00:53:53.510
<v Speaker 3>but they're fairly commonplace,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but success complete fuck up.</v>

1239
00:53:53.630 --> 00:53:55.850
<v Speaker 3>Success again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are the stories.</v>

1240
00:53:55.880 --> 00:53:58.730
<v Speaker 3>Those are the ones I enjoy and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>very.</v>

1241
00:53:58.760 --> 00:53:59.780
<v Speaker 3>It's very American,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1242
00:53:59.781 --> 00:54:04.781
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we love the comeback and there was some </v>

1243
00:54:04.781 --> 00:54:07.301
<v Speaker 3>performances of axles when they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>attempting to come back or maybe he was </v>

1244
00:54:07.301 --> 00:54:08.360
<v Speaker 3>touring on his own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget which one it was,</v>

1245
00:54:08.570 --> 00:54:11.450
<v Speaker 3>what he was like off and it wasn't quite</v>
<v Speaker 3>there yet.</v>

1246
00:54:11.660 --> 00:54:15.290
<v Speaker 3>And now you see him now live and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking killing it.</v>

1247
00:54:15.660 --> 00:54:17.000
<v Speaker 3>It's like he turned it around.</v>

1248
00:54:18.680 --> 00:54:23.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'm saying is you could sit </v>

1249
00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:24.200
<v Speaker 2>there and talk about what somebody did </v>
<v Speaker 2>in some year passed,</v>

1250
00:54:24.201 --> 00:54:26.900
<v Speaker 2>but if they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they put it back together,</v>

1251
00:54:27.020 --> 00:54:29.050
<v Speaker 2>they put it back together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not because they're trying to,</v>

1252
00:54:29.130 --> 00:54:29.570
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1253
00:54:29.750 --> 00:54:34.750
<v Speaker 2>to satisfy something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're putting it together because the </v>

1254
00:54:34.750 --> 00:54:34.750
<v Speaker 2>forces within them are not easily </v>
<v Speaker 2>controlled,</v>

1255
00:54:34.750 --> 00:54:36.260
<v Speaker 2>but when there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a good fighter,</v>

1256
00:54:36.261 --> 00:54:36.740
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When they,</v>

1257
00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:39.500
<v Speaker 2>when they put it all together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1258
00:54:39.501 --> 00:54:42.040
<v Speaker 2>I've heard you talk in commentary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a good fighter,</v>

1259
00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:45.050
<v Speaker 2>like manages their adrenaline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>manages their,</v>

1260
00:54:45.370 --> 00:54:46.610
<v Speaker 2>their focus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

1261
00:54:46.611 --> 00:54:49.490
<v Speaker 2>You can't go completely hog and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't be too conservative.</v>

1262
00:54:49.491 --> 00:54:51.020
<v Speaker 2>You're right on that line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1263
00:54:51.050 --> 00:54:52.700
<v Speaker 2>And that's what performance really is </v>
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>

1264
00:54:52.701 --> 00:54:57.701
<v Speaker 2>It's like a lot of people outside the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bubble have a hard time understanding </v>

1265
00:54:57.701 --> 00:54:57.701
<v Speaker 2>this like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1266
00:54:57.701 --> 00:54:59.510
<v Speaker 2>every night I stepped on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to do a good show.</v>

1267
00:54:59.540 --> 00:55:03.110
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it's just not there to be had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could be the moon or it could be what</v>

1268
00:55:03.111 --> 00:55:08.111
<v Speaker 2>I eat for breakfast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I could be consistent </v>

1269
00:55:08.111 --> 00:55:11.141
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that makes me as </v>

1270
00:55:11.141 --> 00:55:12.221
<v Speaker 2>fascinating as somebody who's like </v>
<v Speaker 2>rolling the dice every time I'm up </v>

1271
00:55:12.221 --> 00:55:12.221
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1272
00:55:12.221 --> 00:55:12.221
<v Speaker 2>I think that's much more interesting.</v>

1273
00:55:12.630 --> 00:55:14.370
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the things that makes live</v>

1274
00:55:14.371 --> 00:55:15.750
<v Speaker 3>shows so unique,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1275
00:55:15.810 --> 00:55:18.420
<v Speaker 3>Is that you know that this guy is doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>it right now.</v>

1276
00:55:18.780 --> 00:55:21.240
<v Speaker 3>It's all happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The words are coming out of his mouth.</v>

1277
00:55:21.241 --> 00:55:25.080
<v Speaker 3>He's managing this moment apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1278
00:55:25.890 --> 00:55:30.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're a successful performer like </v>

1279
00:55:30.890 --> 00:55:33.960
<v Speaker 3>yourself and you see one hit wonders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one hit wonders of always freaked me the</v>

1280
00:55:33.961 --> 00:55:38.961
<v Speaker 3>fuck out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't know why I'm not even a </v>

1281
00:55:38.961 --> 00:55:41.331
<v Speaker 3>musician,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just the horror of being successful </v>

1282
00:55:41.331 --> 00:55:44.430
<v Speaker 3>and hitting and then it all going away </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you're fucked.</v>

1283
00:55:44.431 --> 00:55:45.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was terrified at that.</v>

1284
00:55:45.690 --> 00:55:48.750
<v Speaker 3>God has got to be so scary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

1285
00:55:48.930 --> 00:55:53.930
<v Speaker 3>to me one of the more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the weirder opportunities or </v>

1286
00:55:54.671 --> 00:55:59.671
<v Speaker 3>moments in pop culture is when that kind</v>
<v Speaker 3>of stuff happens because with one song,</v>

1287
00:56:01.180 --> 00:56:02.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's my cherry pie.</v>

1288
00:56:02.801 --> 00:56:05.160
<v Speaker 3>You can just shoot to the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>charts.</v>

1289
00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:06.970
<v Speaker 3>Didn't they have two hits though?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they had a couple.</v>

1290
00:56:06.971 --> 00:56:08.860
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there to hit wonders.</v>

1291
00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:09.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

1292
00:56:09.690 --> 00:56:12.040
<v Speaker 3>there's a gang of bands that had.</v>

1293
00:56:12.090 --> 00:56:12.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say the band,</v>

1294
00:56:12.991 --> 00:56:17.991
<v Speaker 2>but like somebody I know went to see one</v>
<v Speaker 2>of those one hit wonder type pants and </v>

1295
00:56:17.991 --> 00:56:21.831
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they did their big famous song and the </v>

1296
00:56:21.831 --> 00:56:21.831
<v Speaker 2>crowd went crazy and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1297
00:56:21.831 --> 00:56:24.080
<v Speaker 2>they didn't see it at the show and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>back on for that recording</v>

1298
00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:26.750
<v Speaker 1>they did the song again the same side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1299
00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:28.660
<v Speaker 1>And that's like for me it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>performance.</v>

1300
00:56:28.700 --> 00:56:33.700
<v Speaker 1>It's heartbreaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it'd be like me playing today </v>

1301
00:56:33.700 --> 00:56:36.240
<v Speaker 1>twice or something and here it is again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1302
00:56:36.241 --> 00:56:41.241
<v Speaker 1>That's two versions of stairway would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the dice man coming out and doing </v>

1303
00:56:41.551 --> 00:56:43.840
<v Speaker 1>the rhymes again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1304
00:56:44.610 --> 00:56:47.320
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing about becoming a character,</v>

1305
00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:49.150
<v Speaker 1>what you were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is,</v>

1306
00:56:49.180 --> 00:56:53.050
<v Speaker 1>that is a fascinating trap that I could </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine we'd be difficult.</v>

1307
00:56:53.051 --> 00:56:55.360
<v Speaker 1>The expectations of your fans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1308
00:56:55.361 --> 00:56:57.460
<v Speaker 1>I just love the fact that you've managed</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1309
00:56:57.640 --> 00:56:58.600
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1310
00:56:58.660 --> 00:57:02.080
<v Speaker 1>so comfortably with Coke Cardio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people not having,</v>

1311
00:57:02.110 --> 00:57:05.070
<v Speaker 1>but I'm uncomfortable with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all that matters.</v>

1312
00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:08.830
<v Speaker 1>I would argue that that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1313
00:57:08.860 --> 00:57:10.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the plant,</v>

1314
00:57:10.211 --> 00:57:12.040
<v Speaker 1>I planted these acoustic shows and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1315
00:57:12.070 --> 00:57:13.990
<v Speaker 1>at some point people start shouting out </v>
<v Speaker 1>songs and I,</v>

1316
00:57:13.991 --> 00:57:15.190
<v Speaker 1>and I just say to the audience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1317
00:57:15.191 --> 00:57:19.410
<v Speaker 1>the great thing about turning 50 so I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't give a fuck what you want to do,</v>

1318
00:57:19.420 --> 00:57:20.080
<v Speaker 1>what I want to do.</v>

1319
00:57:20.870 --> 00:57:22.030
<v Speaker 1>And at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1320
00:57:22.270 --> 00:57:24.640
<v Speaker 1>that sells better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So most of the audience,</v>

1321
00:57:24.820 --> 00:57:26.440
<v Speaker 1>because most of the audience I would </v>
<v Speaker 1>argue,</v>

1322
00:57:26.530 --> 00:57:31.530
<v Speaker 1>appreciates me being independent even if</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't always get what they want </v>

1323
00:57:31.530 --> 00:57:32.950
<v Speaker 1>than being a shill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1324
00:57:33.310 --> 00:57:36.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't think people get behind rebels </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they want them to sell out.</v>

1325
00:57:36.190 --> 00:57:37.900
<v Speaker 1>They get behind rebels because they want</v>
<v Speaker 1>him to stay real.</v>

1326
00:57:37.930 --> 00:57:39.250
<v Speaker 1>Rebellious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1327
00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:40.060
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1328
00:57:40.061 --> 00:57:43.390
<v Speaker 1>For every person who yells out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want you to do your old stuff.</v>

1329
00:57:43.391 --> 00:57:46.270
<v Speaker 1>There's many more people that just want </v>
<v Speaker 1>you to be you.</v>

1330
00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:47.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would hope.</v>

1331
00:57:47.921 --> 00:57:48.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1332
00:57:48.970 --> 00:57:49.990
<v Speaker 1>I would think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1333
00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:55.500
<v Speaker 1>You're doing really intimate places like</v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube in that Hollywood cemetery is </v>

1334
00:57:55.500 --> 00:57:58.981
<v Speaker 1>pretty well playing the cemetery and my </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend Duncan used to do comedy shows </v>

1335
00:57:58.981 --> 00:57:58.981
<v Speaker 1>out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

1336
00:57:58.981 --> 00:58:00.090
<v Speaker 1>They do comedy there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They used to duck.</v>

1337
00:58:00.110 --> 00:58:05.110
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anybody else did it </v>

1338
00:58:05.110 --> 00:58:05.110
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

1339
00:58:05.110 --> 00:58:06.010
<v Speaker 1>Now he just decided it's a bit strange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1340
00:58:06.790 --> 00:58:11.790
<v Speaker 1>just weird that they have a concert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we couldn't sound check until a </v>

1341
00:58:11.790 --> 00:58:12.670
<v Speaker 1>certain time because there were people </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a bereaved.</v>

1342
00:58:13.030 --> 00:58:15.490
<v Speaker 1>People coming in to make their funeral </v>
<v Speaker 1>arrangements.</v>

1343
00:58:15.550 --> 00:58:17.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like a weird thing like yeah,</v>

1344
00:58:17.441 --> 00:58:20.200
<v Speaker 1>we can't sound check till 5:30</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's somebody in the anteroom</v>

1345
00:58:20.530 --> 00:58:23.140
<v Speaker 1>making burial arrangements for their </v>
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>

1346
00:58:23.290 --> 00:58:24.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Legitimately.</v>

1347
00:58:24.370 --> 00:58:24.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1348
00:58:24.911 --> 00:58:27.520
<v Speaker 1>Like it's a real cemetery that also has </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerts.</v>

1349
00:58:27.521 --> 00:58:30.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many does it seat to 50.</v>

1350
00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:32.470
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's really small.</v>

1351
00:58:32.890 --> 00:58:34.300
<v Speaker 1>It's a cool vibe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's beautiful.</v>

1352
00:58:34.301 --> 00:58:35.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1353
00:58:35.291 --> 00:58:37.540
<v Speaker 1>I love the old Hollywood stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>

1354
00:58:37.790 --> 00:58:39.760
<v Speaker 1>works for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is a bit weird.</v>

1355
00:58:39.910 --> 00:58:41.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I literally texted,</v>

1356
00:58:41.410 --> 00:58:42.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like an ex girlfriend,</v>

1357
00:58:42.791 --> 00:58:45.460
<v Speaker 1>like I'm literally playing a cemetery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

1358
00:58:45.461 --> 00:58:46.750
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just sounds so,</v>

1359
00:58:46.751 --> 00:58:47.350
<v Speaker 1>like what?</v>

1360
00:58:47.720 --> 00:58:48.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1361
00:58:48.980 --> 00:58:51.210
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what chose you or what,</v>

1362
00:58:51.240 --> 00:58:53.260
<v Speaker 1>what made you choose that venue?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1363
00:58:53.290 --> 00:58:53.710
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1364
00:58:53.711 --> 00:58:55.450
<v Speaker 1>you got your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your agents sort of,</v>

1365
00:58:55.660 --> 00:58:56.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're playing.</v>

1366
00:58:56.600 --> 00:59:01.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm playing acoustic tour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I played over two hours literally by </v>

1367
00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:01.600
<v Speaker 1>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No help.</v>

1368
00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:06.390
<v Speaker 1>So environment helps a lot with kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>creating the atmosphere to do that in </v>

1369
00:59:07.120 --> 00:59:09.880
<v Speaker 1>the more sterile the environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the less it feels kind of special.</v>

1370
00:59:10.010 --> 00:59:10.780
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1371
00:59:10.781 --> 00:59:13.420
<v Speaker 1>And so I do find the environment </v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly helps.</v>

1372
00:59:14.110 --> 00:59:15.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>

1373
00:59:15.100 --> 00:59:17.530
<v Speaker 1>that's a small group of people to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1374
00:59:17.650 --> 00:59:21.980
<v Speaker 1>Like what is that like to go from these </v>
<v Speaker 1>big venues to doing these intimate</v>

1375
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:22.130
<v Speaker 3>setting.</v>

1376
00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:26.350
<v Speaker 2>I used to really find that I could play </v>
<v Speaker 2>a different show,</v>

1377
00:59:26.530 --> 00:59:31.530
<v Speaker 2>small versus big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've found over the last 10 years I </v>

1378
00:59:31.530 --> 00:59:32.710
<v Speaker 2>blamed the Internet that almost every </v>
<v Speaker 2>audience is now the same.</v>

1379
00:59:33.250 --> 00:59:38.250
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That the expectations of the audience </v>

1380
00:59:38.250 --> 00:59:38.250
<v Speaker 2>from 2:50</v>
<v Speaker 2>to 5,000</v>

1381
00:59:38.250 --> 00:59:42.091
<v Speaker 2>or up is almost identical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That may be have also have something to </v>

1382
00:59:42.091 --> 00:59:46.171
<v Speaker 2>do with just having a long career and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then people kind of say I want to see </v>

1383
00:59:46.171 --> 00:59:48.361
<v Speaker 2>these songs or something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't find as much willingness to </v>

1384
00:59:48.361 --> 00:59:49.450
<v Speaker 2>take the journey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1385
00:59:49.451 --> 00:59:51.010
<v Speaker 2>used to be because we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1386
00:59:51.011 --> 00:59:56.011
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the nineties who would do shows in a </v>

1387
00:59:56.011 --> 00:59:56.011
<v Speaker 2>club and we would play no hits and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>play weird besides.</v>

1388
00:59:56.011 --> 00:59:57.880
<v Speaker 2>And people loved it because it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm seeing the band,</v>

1389
00:59:57.881 --> 00:59:59.530
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't get to see it the normal </v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

1390
01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:05.040
<v Speaker 2>And then at some point that stopped and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we would play a small club and play a </v>

1391
01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:05.890
<v Speaker 2>bunch of weird stuff and people would be</v>
<v Speaker 2>furious.</v>

1392
01:00:06.260 --> 01:00:11.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would look at twitter after it was </v>

1393
01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:11.260
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck you,</v>

1394
01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:11.260
<v Speaker 2>you ruined my night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1395
01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:12.540
<v Speaker 2>it was really furious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1396
01:00:13.490 --> 01:00:18.490
<v Speaker 3>But how many of those people were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean like if you're in front of 400 </v>

1397
01:00:18.490 --> 01:00:19.850
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many of those people were furious?</v>

1398
01:00:19.851 --> 01:00:20.570
<v Speaker 3>Is it three?</v>

1399
01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:22.580
<v Speaker 2>It would be a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1400
01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:23.580
<v Speaker 2>it'd be awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1401
01:00:23.590 --> 01:00:25.630
<v Speaker 2>it was a lot strange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Weird,</v>

1402
01:00:25.631 --> 01:00:27.100
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

1403
01:00:27.101 --> 01:00:28.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a cultural thing.</v>

1404
01:00:28.661 --> 01:00:31.500
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's a generational thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perhaps.</v>

1405
01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:32.610
<v Speaker 2>Don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't know.</v>

1406
01:00:32.740 --> 01:00:36.310
<v Speaker 2>It surprised me because I grew up in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this kind of anarchy time,</v>

1407
01:00:36.340 --> 01:00:38.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mosh pits and you know,</v>

1408
01:00:38.460 --> 01:00:42.490
<v Speaker 2>we used to play a 45 minutes on religion</v>
<v Speaker 2>playing a 45 minute song today.</v>

1409
01:00:44.570 --> 01:00:46.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean a 45 minute song.</v>

1410
01:00:46.230 --> 01:00:47.610
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

1411
01:00:47.790 --> 01:00:51.420
<v Speaker 3>So what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you enjoy being on top of people like</v>

1412
01:00:51.421 --> 01:00:53.820
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a 250 seat.</v>

1413
01:00:54.060 --> 01:00:55.800
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't bother me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't bother me at all.</v>

1414
01:00:56.370 --> 01:00:57.270
<v Speaker 3>Does it feel different?</v>

1415
01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:01.990
<v Speaker 2>What did you just get into your music in</v>
<v Speaker 2>order to play acoustic?</v>

1416
01:01:01.991 --> 01:01:03.860
<v Speaker 2>I go super within.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1417
01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:04.520
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1418
01:01:04.860 --> 01:01:09.860
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found that even because I originally </v>

1419
01:01:09.860 --> 01:01:09.860
<v Speaker 2>was going to stand in this I know seems </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of minor detail,</v>

1420
01:01:09.860 --> 01:01:14.160
<v Speaker 2>but I decided to sit and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I actually found by sitting and </v>

1421
01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:18.061
<v Speaker 2>being very still and just performing and</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing my best job of performing the </v>

1422
01:01:18.061 --> 01:01:19.150
<v Speaker 2>songs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the audience enjoyed the show better.</v>

1423
01:01:19.390 --> 01:01:22.810
<v Speaker 2>Like I took out all the show Showbiz,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know when you're standing,</v>

1424
01:01:22.811 --> 01:01:23.520
<v Speaker 2>you're doing the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1425
01:01:23.530 --> 01:01:24.030
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1426
01:01:24.130 --> 01:01:29.130
<v Speaker 2>whatever your moves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think creating a level of intimacy and</v>

1427
01:01:29.471 --> 01:01:34.471
<v Speaker 2>drawing the audience forward is probably</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only sort of difference maker that </v>

1428
01:01:34.471 --> 01:01:35.570
<v Speaker 2>I've found because there's literally no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no showbiz.</v>

1429
01:01:35.620 --> 01:01:36.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what can I do</v>

1430
01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:41.180
<v Speaker 3>you seem very concerned with like you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want the audience to enjoy it.</v>

1431
01:01:41.730 --> 01:01:43.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't use to care.</v>

1432
01:01:43.170 --> 01:01:48.170
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to view performing as an art </v>

1433
01:01:48.170 --> 01:01:50.841
<v Speaker 2>project thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is I want to sort of create a </v>

1434
01:01:50.841 --> 01:01:53.871
<v Speaker 2>provocative situation and then I want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>ride the wave of the provocative </v>

1435
01:01:53.871 --> 01:01:54.360
<v Speaker 2>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1436
01:01:54.450 --> 01:01:57.600
<v Speaker 2>and of course I grew up in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>generational thing that the audience was</v>

1437
01:01:57.601 --> 01:02:02.160
<v Speaker 2>sort of interested in that sort of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>explosive nature of the mosh pit and you</v>

1438
01:02:02.161 --> 01:02:07.161
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this kind of weird sublimated violence </v>

1439
01:02:07.161 --> 01:02:09.051
<v Speaker 2>that would kind of come out during the </v>
<v Speaker 2>shows and we were part of the engine </v>

1440
01:02:09.051 --> 01:02:09.060
<v Speaker 2>that would sort of bring up this </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotional quality.</v>

1441
01:02:09.630 --> 01:02:11.400
<v Speaker 2>And then at some point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1442
01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:13.710
<v Speaker 2>things change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

1443
01:02:13.711 --> 01:02:15.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's a generational </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

1444
01:02:15.601 --> 01:02:20.601
<v Speaker 2>but I found that um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only I could play older music with a</v>

1445
01:02:22.591 --> 01:02:26.430
<v Speaker 2>good heart and an open mind was to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the others,</v>

1446
01:02:26.431 --> 01:02:31.431
<v Speaker 2>appreciating it because if he asked me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not for me anymore because in </v>

1447
01:02:31.771 --> 01:02:36.090
<v Speaker 2>essence is an artist and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not trying to jump in your head,</v>

1448
01:02:36.091 --> 01:02:37.260
<v Speaker 2>but as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as an artist,</v>

1449
01:02:37.261 --> 01:02:41.490
<v Speaker 2>I want to be able to say how do I feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>tonight and tonight I want to,</v>

1450
01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:42.780
<v Speaker 2>I've written like 400 songs.</v>

1451
01:02:42.780 --> 01:02:43.980
<v Speaker 2>So to me I would like to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1452
01:02:43.981 --> 01:02:46.710
<v Speaker 2>of these 400 songs I just feel like </v>
<v Speaker 2>playing these 15 songs tonight,</v>

1453
01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:51.980
<v Speaker 2>but I can't do that because I do have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>go out and do the Hickory dickory dock </v>

1454
01:02:51.980 --> 01:02:51.980
<v Speaker 2>poem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1455
01:02:52.010 --> 01:02:52.860
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of,</v>

1456
01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:56.100
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of expected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if I don't I'm going to get lit up.</v>

1457
01:02:56.640 --> 01:03:01.640
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I had to kind of create this weird </v>

1458
01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:03.600
<v Speaker 2>truce in my mind where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what way can I do this material in a way</v>

1459
01:03:03.601 --> 01:03:08.070
<v Speaker 2>that feels heartfelt and genuine?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I found by letting myself appreciate</v>

1460
01:03:08.071 --> 01:03:13.071
<v Speaker 2>the audience's appreciation of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>created like a joy that I didn't have </v>

1461
01:03:13.071 --> 01:03:14.760
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It didn't feel like a defeat and uh,</v>

1462
01:03:15.060 --> 01:03:18.150
<v Speaker 2>and a tapping out to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the moment it felt like,</v>

1463
01:03:18.660 --> 01:03:19.230
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1464
01:03:19.470 --> 01:03:22.800
<v Speaker 2>we can create this exchange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was this a gradual process?</v>

1465
01:03:22.801 --> 01:03:27.801
<v Speaker 2>Took me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it took me awhile because I came from </v>

1466
01:03:27.801 --> 01:03:29.871
<v Speaker 2>such complete anarchy that does sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>put myself in the straight jacket of </v>

1467
01:03:29.871 --> 01:03:30.310
<v Speaker 2>being a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1468
01:03:30.510 --> 01:03:31.440
<v Speaker 2>growing up in the air.</v>

1469
01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:36.440
<v Speaker 2>I grew up and it felt like putting on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the gold lamay jacket and going to </v>

1470
01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:36.440
<v Speaker 2>vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it felt like to me.</v>

1471
01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:37.050
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it felt like I was really,</v>

1472
01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:38.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1473
01:03:38.070 --> 01:03:39.120
<v Speaker 2>I'd become,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1474
01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:41.860
<v Speaker 2>one of those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1475
01:03:41.940 --> 01:03:46.940
<v Speaker 2>doing the musty old routine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like this is so antithetical to </v>

1476
01:03:46.940 --> 01:03:48.000
<v Speaker 2>why be even became an artist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But at some point,</v>

1477
01:03:48.001 --> 01:03:49.710
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to appreciate that.</v>

1478
01:03:50.100 --> 01:03:55.100
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I talked about it once with Pete </v>

1479
01:03:55.100 --> 01:03:55.100
<v Speaker 2>Townsend in private.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the idea that,</v>

1480
01:03:55.410 --> 01:04:00.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is your responsibility to a </v>

1481
01:04:00.410 --> 01:04:02.841
<v Speaker 2>generational memory?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Pete was talking to me once about </v>

1482
01:04:02.841 --> 01:04:05.460
<v Speaker 2>how people were getting mad at him for </v>
<v Speaker 2>using a and I saw him quoted publicly so</v>

1483
01:04:05.461 --> 01:04:07.380
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel like I can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm giving anything away.</v>

1484
01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:12.920
<v Speaker 2>People are getting mad at him for using </v>
<v Speaker 2>like won't get fooled again in a car </v>

1485
01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:14.340
<v Speaker 2>commercial and Pete's quote was </v>
<v Speaker 2>something along the lines of like,</v>

1486
01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:17.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't care if you lost your virginity </v>
<v Speaker 2>to Mary Lou in the back seat to my song.</v>

1487
01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.890
<v Speaker 2>It's my song.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can do with it what I want.</v>

1488
01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:25.880
<v Speaker 2>So it takes time to sort of appreciate </v>
<v Speaker 2>that at some point if you've been lucky </v>

1489
01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:30.381
<v Speaker 2>enough and it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I am lucky enough to have created a </v>

1490
01:04:30.381 --> 01:04:33.020
<v Speaker 2>few kind of cultural milestones for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>generation or multiple generations that </v>

1491
01:04:33.020 --> 01:04:34.860
<v Speaker 2>they feel very possessive of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1492
01:04:35.730 --> 01:04:38.130
<v Speaker 2>And so if you're not willing to possess </v>
<v Speaker 2>them with them,</v>

1493
01:04:38.131 --> 01:04:42.210
<v Speaker 2>it almost feels like to them you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>rejecting their idea not your own.</v>

1494
01:04:42.540 --> 01:04:44.610
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See to my mind,</v>

1495
01:04:44.611 --> 01:04:45.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1496
01:04:45.061 --> 01:04:47.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm the author.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I don't feel like playing that song.</v>

1497
01:04:47.101 --> 01:04:49.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's my decision.</v>

1498
01:04:49.830 --> 01:04:54.830
<v Speaker 2>So you sold them on something and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're not buying anymore then it </v>

1499
01:04:54.830 --> 01:04:56.730
<v Speaker 2>almost feels like you're rejecting their</v>
<v Speaker 2>approval.</v>

1500
01:04:56.790 --> 01:04:58.390
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1501
01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:03.560
<v Speaker 2>And when you're surrounded by a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 2>sycophantic artists who are literally </v>

1502
01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:06.720
<v Speaker 2>tripping all over themselves to give the</v>
<v Speaker 2>audience what they want to create.</v>

1503
01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:11.720
<v Speaker 2>This kind of idealized isn't this </v>
<v Speaker 2>amazing feeling and we've all been to </v>

1504
01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:13.830
<v Speaker 2>those shows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the greatest concert ever.</v>

1505
01:05:13.831 --> 01:05:16.560
<v Speaker 2>And then you go to the next show and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the exact same lines in between the</v>

1506
01:05:16.561 --> 01:05:18.610
<v Speaker 2>songs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's Vegas,</v>

1507
01:05:18.611 --> 01:05:19.330
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1508
01:05:19.610 --> 01:05:22.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean capable of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my way of feeling like you.</v>

1509
01:05:23.710 --> 01:05:28.710
<v Speaker 2>But my appreciation of that was to try </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get inside the head of why the </v>

1510
01:05:28.710 --> 01:05:32.260
<v Speaker 2>audience needed that from me because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>felt burdensome.</v>

1511
01:05:32.261 --> 01:05:36.880
<v Speaker 2>Like why me like get it from the guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>over there.</v>

1512
01:05:36.881 --> 01:05:40.120
<v Speaker 2>Like there's plenty of people you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>get this vibe from.</v>

1513
01:05:40.121 --> 01:05:42.280
<v Speaker 2>Why me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the nickelback thing,</v>

1514
01:05:42.281 --> 01:05:45.430
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like people demand sincerity and if they</v>

1515
01:05:45.431 --> 01:05:48.190
<v Speaker 2>think that you're in like nickelback not</v>
<v Speaker 2>that bad,</v>

1516
01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:52.150
<v Speaker 2>but there are the fucking punchline of </v>
<v Speaker 2>punchlines when it comes to bad,</v>

1517
01:05:52.330 --> 01:05:54.460
<v Speaker 2>bad music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to me,</v>

1518
01:05:54.461 --> 01:05:58.030
<v Speaker 2>the guy's an incredible writer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean Chad,</v>

1519
01:05:58.120 --> 01:05:59.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's an incredible songwriter.</v>

1520
01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:02.770
<v Speaker 2>I like their songs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked some of their music.</v>

1521
01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:03.850
<v Speaker 2>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it.</v>

1522
01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:07.990
<v Speaker 2>Some of it is like cliche subject matter</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't care of.</v>

1523
01:06:07.991 --> 01:06:10.960
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of great songs that have </v>
<v Speaker 2>cliche sub subject matter,</v>

1524
01:06:11.490 --> 01:06:13.530
<v Speaker 2>but I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's anything I.</v>

1525
01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:16.240
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know enough about their world,</v>

1526
01:06:16.241 --> 01:06:19.810
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think there's anything wrong</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that's who you want to be.</v>

1527
01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:24.840
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pop to me is predicated on unsatisfying </v>

1528
01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:24.840
<v Speaker 2>pop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've said it many times.</v>

1529
01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:27.610
<v Speaker 2>Pop is pouring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pouring and want to get you off.</v>

1530
01:06:27.660 --> 01:06:28.420
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1531
01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:29.870
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

1532
01:06:30.070 --> 01:06:31.600
<v Speaker 2>you know how they're going to get you </v>
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>

1533
01:06:31.630 --> 01:06:32.700
<v Speaker 2>That's a good way of looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1534
01:06:32.890 --> 01:06:35.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm not that concerned with getting you </v>
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>

1535
01:06:35.441 --> 01:06:38.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm just not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just not.</v>

1536
01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:41.800
<v Speaker 2>It's just not in my DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was never that guy.</v>

1537
01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:43.330
<v Speaker 2>I was never that guy.</v>

1538
01:06:43.330 --> 01:06:44.830
<v Speaker 2>So to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So at some point,</v>

1539
01:06:44.831 --> 01:06:46.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pick your age,</v>

1540
01:06:46.031 --> 01:06:48.460
<v Speaker 2>41,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got some guy tapping on the shoulder</v>

1541
01:06:48.461 --> 01:06:48.880
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1542
01:06:48.881 --> 01:06:50.980
<v Speaker 2>I need you to be that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like me.</v>

1543
01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:54.790
<v Speaker 2>Have you looked at me lately?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm not that guy.</v>

1544
01:06:55.340 --> 01:07:00.340
<v Speaker 2>He's a very strange so I had to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>inside the head of why people needed </v>

1545
01:07:00.340 --> 01:07:04.561
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what that did for them and sort of </v>

1546
01:07:04.561 --> 01:07:05.200
<v Speaker 2>a very general level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's sort of,</v>

1547
01:07:05.201 --> 01:07:06.310
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

1548
01:07:06.580 --> 01:07:08.670
<v Speaker 2>it's a community thing or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1549
01:07:09.070 --> 01:07:11.860
<v Speaker 2>And so there's a way to do it where it </v>
<v Speaker 2>feels good,</v>

1550
01:07:11.861 --> 01:07:13.470
<v Speaker 2>positive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>loving and,</v>

1551
01:07:13.810 --> 01:07:15.190
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and proportional.</v>

1552
01:07:15.191 --> 01:07:18.880
<v Speaker 2>Like it doesn't have to be slobbish and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it can be cool like okay,</v>

1553
01:07:18.881 --> 01:07:22.150
<v Speaker 2>this is the right moment for it or I can</v>
<v Speaker 2>set this up and now I can do it.</v>

1554
01:07:22.410 --> 01:07:25.660
<v Speaker 2>Like using the dice man as an example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen him a couple times.</v>

1555
01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:30.920
<v Speaker 2>I laughed my ass off when I saw him and </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I saw him he did his whole routine.</v>

1556
01:07:31.091 --> 01:07:33.440
<v Speaker 2>He showed up at the comedy store one </v>
<v Speaker 2>night I just happened,</v>

1557
01:07:33.441 --> 01:07:38.441
<v Speaker 2>would they be there with a friend?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he did it like an unannounced </v>

1558
01:07:38.441 --> 01:07:40.890
<v Speaker 2>appearance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was fantastic and at the end he kind </v>

1559
01:07:40.890 --> 01:07:40.890
<v Speaker 2>Kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he kinda of made the face and like.</v>

1560
01:07:40.890 --> 01:07:45.511
<v Speaker 2>And then he went into it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it felt like it was the only way he </v>

1561
01:07:45.511 --> 01:07:45.570
<v Speaker 2>could stop the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1562
01:07:45.820 --> 01:07:47.350
<v Speaker 2>So it right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In that moment it felt like,</v>

1563
01:07:47.380 --> 01:07:48.430
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is cool.</v>

1564
01:07:48.910 --> 01:07:50.710
<v Speaker 2>Because it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it feels like,</v>

1565
01:07:51.190 --> 01:07:52.120
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've been good.</v>

1566
01:07:52.330 --> 01:07:54.400
<v Speaker 2>We ate the whole cake together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the cherry.</v>

1567
01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:59.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when it feels like I got to do this </v>

1568
01:07:59.520 --> 01:07:59.860
<v Speaker 2>because that's the gay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1569
01:08:00.010 --> 01:08:01.900
<v Speaker 2>I went through that whole process </v>
<v Speaker 2>himself.</v>

1570
01:08:02.140 --> 01:08:04.930
<v Speaker 2>Like he abandoned the rhymes for a long </v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

1571
01:08:04.990 --> 01:08:07.000
<v Speaker 2>didn't even kind of try to abandon the </v>
<v Speaker 2>character a bit.</v>

1572
01:08:07.060 --> 01:08:10.420
<v Speaker 2>I have a little bit of a memory of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did a television show,</v>

1573
01:08:10.510 --> 01:08:15.510
<v Speaker 2>like a regular sitcoms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he cried on some TV show like </v>

1574
01:08:15.921 --> 01:08:16.640
<v Speaker 2>Arsenio Hall</v>

1575
01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:21.640
<v Speaker 3>or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about people angry at him for being </v>

1576
01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:24.851
<v Speaker 3>controversial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I don't remember the early days of </v>

1577
01:08:24.851 --> 01:08:25.610
<v Speaker 3>political correctness when TV first came</v>
<v Speaker 3>around.</v>

1578
01:08:25.620 --> 01:08:27.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1579
01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:32.080
<v Speaker 3>It was A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was a little bit of a trap </v>

1580
01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:33.020
<v Speaker 3>that he felt like he was in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now I think in a similar fashion,</v>

1581
01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:33.840
<v Speaker 3>maybe similar</v>

1582
01:08:34.060 --> 01:08:37.270
<v Speaker 2>and using him as a sort of a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As an example,</v>

1583
01:08:37.870 --> 01:08:40.570
<v Speaker 2>how many comedians have actually risen </v>
<v Speaker 2>up to that site?</v>

1584
01:08:40.571 --> 01:08:43.210
<v Speaker 2>Guys?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Level on almost none.</v>

1585
01:08:43.211 --> 01:08:48.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's been like a handful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was hot as you could be ever.</v>

1586
01:08:48.220 --> 01:08:53.220
<v Speaker 2>So paralleling my own self in that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does create this weird</v>

1587
01:08:56.540 --> 01:09:01.540
<v Speaker 2>cause cause the 20 percent who know </v>
<v Speaker 2>every song and and whatever and know </v>

1588
01:09:01.540 --> 01:09:03.990
<v Speaker 2>every nuance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other 80 percent they just know the,</v>

1589
01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:07.040
<v Speaker 2>the greatest hits thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not their fault.</v>

1590
01:09:07.490 --> 01:09:08.720
<v Speaker 2>It feels weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1591
01:09:08.930 --> 01:09:10.570
<v Speaker 2>is that all I am?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1592
01:09:10.610 --> 01:09:11.750
<v Speaker 2>I've done all this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1593
01:09:12.020 --> 01:09:15.440
<v Speaker 2>didn't you see me when I wave this flag </v>
<v Speaker 2>and now they don't.</v>

1594
01:09:16.130 --> 01:09:19.730
<v Speaker 2>All they know is you're the rat in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cage guy and you can be hostile about it</v>

1595
01:09:19.731 --> 01:09:21.440
<v Speaker 2>all you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to change.</v>

1596
01:09:22.190 --> 01:09:27.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the amount of times I've been in </v>

1597
01:09:27.190 --> 01:09:29.060
<v Speaker 2>a parking garage or a grocery store or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

1598
01:09:29.061 --> 01:09:34.061
<v Speaker 2>and somebody who's very nice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very respectful will walk up to me and </v>

1599
01:09:34.061 --> 01:09:34.870
<v Speaker 2>that's what they know and if you can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>humble,</v>

1600
01:09:34.871 --> 01:09:39.871
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's pretty amazing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>literally I can get off any exit in </v>

1601
01:09:39.871 --> 01:09:43.070
<v Speaker 2>America and pretty much anywhere I go </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody has some reference to what I've</v>

1602
01:09:43.071 --> 01:09:43.310
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>

1603
01:09:43.310 --> 01:09:45.590
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty remarkable.</v>

1604
01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:47.240
<v Speaker 2>So if you can get behind that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can think,</v>

1605
01:09:47.241 --> 01:09:48.020
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty cool.</v>

1606
01:09:48.021 --> 01:09:48.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm cool with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1607
01:09:48.950 --> 01:09:52.100
<v Speaker 2>it's not this oppositional thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you should have paid more attention</v>

1608
01:09:52.101 --> 01:09:55.160
<v Speaker 2>in 94.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Revolution was happening.</v>

1609
01:09:55.161 --> 01:09:58.070
<v Speaker 2>Where were you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were listening to somebody else,</v>

1610
01:09:58.071 --> 01:09:59.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's requirements.</v>

1611
01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:00.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1612
01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:05.640
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I installed so part and parcel to </v>

1613
01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:05.640
<v Speaker 2>when you take a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a fringe movement,</v>

1614
01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:06.140
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1615
01:10:06.141 --> 01:10:07.400
<v Speaker 2>alternative music,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grunge,</v>

1616
01:10:07.401 --> 01:10:09.500
<v Speaker 2>whatever it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's thrown into the mainstream,</v>

1617
01:10:09.860 --> 01:10:14.120
<v Speaker 2>those social codes and mores don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>translate very well to mainstream code.</v>

1618
01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:19.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look at what people have done in </v>

1619
01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:19.440
<v Speaker 2>the last 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just steal that stuff.</v>

1620
01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:24.310
<v Speaker 2>They take this coat and they take this </v>
<v Speaker 2>walk and they take this stance and they </v>

1621
01:10:24.310 --> 01:10:24.560
<v Speaker 2>take this production style and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll take that.</v>

1622
01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:28.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just combined it all together.</v>

1623
01:10:28.380 --> 01:10:30.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's because that's their gig.</v>

1624
01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:34.670
<v Speaker 3>I've always wondered what it's like when</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are.</v>

1625
01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:37.670
<v Speaker 3>When you're beginning as an artist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know you're,</v>

1626
01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:43.600
<v Speaker 3>you're idealistic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have all these ideas about what the </v>

1627
01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:43.700
<v Speaker 3>future could be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who knows?</v>

1628
01:10:43.701 --> 01:10:46.130
<v Speaker 3>It's all wide open and then all of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>sudden,</v>

1629
01:10:46.850 --> 01:10:51.850
<v Speaker 3>many years later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are a fucking massive superstar </v>

1630
01:10:51.850 --> 01:10:55.001
<v Speaker 3>selling out arenas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How difficult is it to find people who </v>

1631
01:10:55.001 --> 01:10:58.130
<v Speaker 3>understand where your head is </v>
<v Speaker 3>impossible.</v>

1632
01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:02.000
<v Speaker 3>Do you like seek out other superstar </v>
<v Speaker 3>musicians?</v>

1633
01:11:02.001 --> 01:11:02.160
<v Speaker 3>And.</v>

1634
01:11:02.510 --> 01:11:04.040
<v Speaker 2>I did and I got nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It.</v>

1635
01:11:04.041 --> 01:11:09.041
<v Speaker 2>They're either really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had a hard time ever getting like </v>

1636
01:11:09.041 --> 01:11:10.220
<v Speaker 2>good data,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's put it that way.</v>

1637
01:11:12.290 --> 01:11:16.140
<v Speaker 2>The freakiest was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw how it changed my inner world,</v>

1638
01:11:16.170 --> 01:11:18.750
<v Speaker 2>meaning friends and family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how so?</v>

1639
01:11:19.410 --> 01:11:23.910
<v Speaker 2>My step grandfather,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was a world war two vet,</v>

1640
01:11:23.940 --> 01:11:26.670
<v Speaker 2>very closed down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>classic Eisenhower,</v>

1641
01:11:26.671 --> 01:11:28.890
<v Speaker 2>Republican type of guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>smart.</v>

1642
01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:34.400
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Had literally zero interest in me as a </v>

1643
01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:34.530
<v Speaker 2>kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1644
01:11:35.220 --> 01:11:40.220
<v Speaker 2>negative zero interest and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and one day I'm sitting there at </v>

1645
01:11:40.220 --> 01:11:42.930
<v Speaker 2>Christmas and now grandpa wants to talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>to me about the economics of my success.</v>

1646
01:11:43.370 --> 01:11:45.150
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

1647
01:11:45.850 --> 01:11:50.850
<v Speaker 2>like that got through to him because </v>
<v Speaker 2>some guy at work or somebody at the </v>

1648
01:11:50.850 --> 01:11:52.260
<v Speaker 2>church brought me up and it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1649
01:11:52.830 --> 01:11:54.240
<v Speaker 2>that's my grandson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>childhood tiers did anything but that I </v>

1651
01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:02.160
<v Speaker 2>saw were warped the gravity in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>family.</v>

1652
01:12:03.090 --> 01:12:04.350
<v Speaker 2>And then you get the friend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1653
01:12:04.351 --> 01:12:05.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1662
01:12:21.501 --> 01:12:21.501
<v Speaker 2>dumb stuff.</v>

1665
01:12:28.770 --> 01:12:28.770
<v Speaker 3>idea of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's funny,</v>

<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1669
01:12:33.590 --> 01:12:35.240
<v Speaker 2>And it was.</v>

<v Speaker 2>so how are you going to pay for this?</v>

1672

<v Speaker 3>to do.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You know.</v>

1678

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1679
01:12:57.790 --> 01:13:02.410
<v Speaker 3>Geez,</v>

1680
01:13:02.500 --> 01:13:07.500
<v Speaker 3>you've reached such a high level that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing above that.</v>

1681
01:13:08.150 --> 01:13:08.660
<v Speaker 3>Like</v>

1682
01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:10.080
<v Speaker 2>I have the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have the antidote,</v>

1683
01:13:10.290 --> 01:13:13.500
<v Speaker 2>my manager who was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1684
01:13:13.610 --> 01:13:15.390
<v Speaker 2>we were with the Metallica guys at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

1685
01:13:15.391 --> 01:13:18.450
<v Speaker 2>he called me on like a Wednesday or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something and he said,</v>

1686
01:13:18.451 --> 01:13:23.451
<v Speaker 2>I can't say for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but more than likely based on the calls </v>

1687
01:13:23.451 --> 01:13:24.900
<v Speaker 2>we're getting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be number one this week.</v>

1688
01:13:24.930 --> 01:13:27.070
<v Speaker 2>Meaning melancholy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

1689
01:13:27.071 --> 01:13:29.490
<v Speaker 2>I literally said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there a position higher?</v>

1690
01:13:32.890 --> 01:13:36.380
<v Speaker 3>Like I couldn't process that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There wasn't like another step.</v>

1691
01:13:36.410 --> 01:13:37.570
<v Speaker 3>Couldn't keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1692
01:13:37.571 --> 01:13:39.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's what I always wondered.</v>

1693
01:13:39.421 --> 01:13:44.421
<v Speaker 3>Like when you reach a certain level and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're sending out these giant arenas </v>

1694
01:13:44.421 --> 01:13:47.540
<v Speaker 3>and you one of the biggest bands </v>
<v Speaker 3>literally ever look at one of the top,</v>

1695
01:13:47.541 --> 01:13:50.120
<v Speaker 3>100 biggest bands of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1696
01:13:50.150 --> 01:13:51.620
<v Speaker 3>Arguably.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1697
01:13:51.690 --> 01:13:52.600
<v Speaker 3>If we're in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1698
01:13:52.650 --> 01:13:53.660
<v Speaker 3>it's in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1699
01:13:54.710 --> 01:13:57.450
<v Speaker 3>Where the fuck do you go?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it had to be this weird.</v>

1700
01:13:57.910 --> 01:14:02.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine the madness is the only </v>

1701
01:14:02.910 --> 01:14:05.111
<v Speaker 3>option.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Madness started becomes attractive at </v>

1702
01:14:05.111 --> 01:14:05.111
<v Speaker 3>that point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

1703
01:14:05.111 --> 01:14:06.350
<v Speaker 3>that's got to be so strange to be just </v>
<v Speaker 3>crushing it.</v>

1704
01:14:06.470 --> 01:14:08.630
<v Speaker 3>Selling out these giant arena is number </v>
<v Speaker 3>one.</v>

1705
01:14:08.631 --> 01:14:11.590
<v Speaker 3>Songs going now what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck do we do?</v>

1706
01:14:11.620 --> 01:14:12.310
<v Speaker 3>Do we fade</v>

1707
01:14:12.310 --> 01:14:13.650
<v Speaker 2>away now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We went crazy.</v>

1708
01:14:13.780 --> 01:14:14.950
<v Speaker 2>We just lost her mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1709
01:14:14.951 --> 01:14:16.720
<v Speaker 2>what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was the process?</v>

1710
01:14:17.020 --> 01:14:20.980
<v Speaker 2>Did you see it slipping away?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or you see the madness and it became,</v>

1711
01:14:20.981 --> 01:14:21.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1712
01:14:21.900 --> 01:14:24.220
<v Speaker 2>it's like a bad relationship or bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationships.</v>

1713
01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:29.280
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it becomes a lot clearer when you're </v>

1714
01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:29.280
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1715
01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:30.370
<v Speaker 2>at the time you sort of do your own </v>
<v Speaker 2>rationalization.</v>

1716
01:14:30.610 --> 01:14:31.420
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1717
01:14:31.590 --> 01:14:33.880
<v Speaker 2>he or she's going crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not me.</v>

1718
01:14:34.780 --> 01:14:37.090
<v Speaker 2>We all went crazy in four different </v>
<v Speaker 2>directions.</v>

1719
01:14:37.300 --> 01:14:38.890
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this and that.</v>

1720
01:14:39.030 --> 01:14:40.850
<v Speaker 2>And the great shame of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

1721
01:14:41.030 --> 01:14:46.030
<v Speaker 2>of my band was musically we were super </v>
<v Speaker 2>tight and we never disagreed on music.</v>

1722
01:14:47.051 --> 01:14:51.790
<v Speaker 2>It was like this weird phenomenon where </v>
<v Speaker 2>musically we were like totally in sync.</v>

1723
01:14:52.270 --> 01:14:55.600
<v Speaker 2>We could produce and write music very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very quickly and it was always the other</v>

1724
01:14:55.601 --> 01:14:58.870
<v Speaker 2>stuff around us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that sort of ate at the core.</v>

1725
01:14:58.871 --> 01:15:01.030
<v Speaker 2>And then when we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we lost our personal relationship,</v>

1726
01:15:01.060 --> 01:15:02.800
<v Speaker 2>that's what diminished the musical </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship.</v>

1727
01:15:05.470 --> 01:15:08.140
<v Speaker 2>But you don't know it at the time </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you sort of,</v>

1728
01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:09.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say arrogance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not the right word,</v>

1729
01:15:09.581 --> 01:15:12.000
<v Speaker 2>but it's like you have a sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1730
01:15:12.001 --> 01:15:17.001
<v Speaker 2>you got a little bit of a thing in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>walk and you think you got the world by </v>

1731
01:15:17.001 --> 01:15:17.440
<v Speaker 2>the unit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What and all good.</v>

1732
01:15:17.710 --> 01:15:20.920
<v Speaker 2>You think you can power your way through</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything because you have,</v>

1733
01:15:21.370 --> 01:15:26.370
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't understand that you do </v>

1734
01:15:26.370 --> 01:15:26.370
<v Speaker 2>actually need the people standing next </v>
<v Speaker 2>to you.</v>

1735
01:15:26.370 --> 01:15:28.240
<v Speaker 2>I have such a greater appreciation for </v>
<v Speaker 2>my bandmates now that now that I've seen</v>

1736
01:15:28.241 --> 01:15:32.870
<v Speaker 2>what we actually did accomplish in ink </v>
<v Speaker 2>is surrounded by chaos.</v>

1737
01:15:32.871 --> 01:15:35.530
<v Speaker 2>But then we created our own cast and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then at some point it all blurs.</v>

1738
01:15:35.830 --> 01:15:40.180
<v Speaker 2>What were the things that fucked it up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was it the money and the fame?</v>

1739
01:15:40.181 --> 01:15:43.150
<v Speaker 2>And was it the tension?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was it the ego?</v>

1740
01:15:43.260 --> 01:15:44.560
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

1741
01:15:44.561 --> 01:15:45.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were,</v>

1742
01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:47.650
<v Speaker 2>we were like one of those bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm behind the musics,</v>

1743
01:15:47.651 --> 01:15:52.651
<v Speaker 2>the very early conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember we had these managers very </v>

1744
01:15:53.471 --> 01:15:55.900
<v Speaker 2>early on in and they were coming to </v>
<v Speaker 2>town,</v>

1745
01:15:55.901 --> 01:16:00.901
<v Speaker 2>sort of courting us before we had a </v>
<v Speaker 2>record deal and one day they came to </v>

1746
01:16:00.901 --> 01:16:03.781
<v Speaker 2>town and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can we just go out to breakfast with </v>

1747
01:16:03.781 --> 01:16:06.271
<v Speaker 2>you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which was weird because it was always </v>

1748
01:16:06.271 --> 01:16:07.120
<v Speaker 2>the whole band like democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they said,</v>

1749
01:16:07.121 --> 01:16:08.200
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they said,</v>

1750
01:16:08.201 --> 01:16:10.240
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>know who writes the songs?</v>

1751
01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:11.110
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1752
01:16:11.111 --> 01:16:12.430
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they said,</v>

1753
01:16:12.431 --> 01:16:13.390
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's gonna be a problem.</v>

1754
01:16:13.750 --> 01:16:18.750
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean it's gonna be a </v>

1755
01:16:18.750 --> 01:16:18.750
<v Speaker 2>problem?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

1756
01:16:18.750 --> 01:16:20.401
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>songwriters and bands make a lot more </v>

1757
01:16:20.401 --> 01:16:22.741
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So our suggestion is you should share </v>

1758
01:16:22.741 --> 01:16:25.450
<v Speaker 2>your songs with your band mates to keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of a kind of a democratic state and</v>

1759
01:16:25.451 --> 01:16:26.900
<v Speaker 2>the use of examples of bands that did </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1760
01:16:26.900 --> 01:16:28.280
<v Speaker 2>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hell no,</v>

1761
01:16:28.281 --> 01:16:31.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm not on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not giving them my work.</v>

1762
01:16:31.271 --> 01:16:33.130
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's my song.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they were like,</v>

1763
01:16:33.131 --> 01:16:34.780
<v Speaker 2>you don't understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna make a lot more money.</v>

1764
01:16:34.781 --> 01:16:36.370
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tough shit.</v>

1765
01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:39.040
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like live and learn kind of thing.</v>

1766
01:16:39.041 --> 01:16:40.660
<v Speaker 2>Why do they think you were going to make</v>
<v Speaker 2>more money?</v>

1767
01:16:40.690 --> 01:16:44.880
<v Speaker 2>Because it was songwriters get a quick </v>
<v Speaker 2>lesson.</v>

1768
01:16:45.220 --> 01:16:50.220
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the songwriter gets paid separate </v>

1769
01:16:50.220 --> 01:16:53.401
<v Speaker 2>statutorily by the government than the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>than the actual copyright of the </v>

1770
01:16:53.401 --> 01:16:55.720
<v Speaker 2>recording.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if I'm on Joe Rogan's label,</v>

1771
01:16:56.290 --> 01:17:01.290
<v Speaker 2>you pay the band for the recording,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which of course in that case would be </v>

1772
01:17:01.290 --> 01:17:04.711
<v Speaker 2>split four ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you owe me a statutory rate as a </v>

1773
01:17:04.711 --> 01:17:08.251
<v Speaker 2>songwriter for the sale,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think these days is about 10 </v>

1774
01:17:08.251 --> 01:17:09.070
<v Speaker 2>sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So every record we,</v>

1775
01:17:09.530 --> 01:17:14.530
<v Speaker 2>where I was the sole songwriter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was getting ten cents that they </v>

1776
01:17:14.530 --> 01:17:15.590
<v Speaker 2>weren't getting a or eight cents or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it was at the time.</v>

1777
01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:18.020
<v Speaker 2>So you can imagine over a gazillion </v>
<v Speaker 2>records sold.</v>

1778
01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:19.940
<v Speaker 2>It added up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1779
01:17:20.090 --> 01:17:23.960
<v Speaker 2>So I start pulling away financially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

1780
01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:28.130
<v Speaker 2>But when you're a kid and you're 23 and </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebodies having this conversation with</v>

1781
01:17:28.131 --> 01:17:30.110
<v Speaker 2>you and you literally don't even have an</v>
<v Speaker 2>apartment,</v>

1782
01:17:30.750 --> 01:17:35.750
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And somebody is trying to tell you how </v>

1783
01:17:35.750 --> 01:17:35.750
<v Speaker 2>you're going to make a lot more money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1784
01:17:35.750 --> 01:17:38.531
<v Speaker 2>what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fast forward four years later and it's </v>

1785
01:17:38.531 --> 01:17:41.261
<v Speaker 2>like I'm making a lot more money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's sort of SOS it organically.</v>

1786
01:17:42.351 --> 01:17:44.090
<v Speaker 2>So his discontent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

1787
01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:49.720
<v Speaker 2>Whether you call it jealousy or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then as I emerged as sort of the </v>

1788
01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:52.010
<v Speaker 2>tour and the big mouth in the band and </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe the person who was most willing to</v>

1789
01:17:52.011 --> 01:17:57.011
<v Speaker 2>be controversy or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd get in a room with journalists and </v>

1790
01:17:57.011 --> 01:18:00.191
<v Speaker 2>they would just talk to me a and then we</v>
<v Speaker 2>get out of the interviews and that the </v>

1791
01:18:00.191 --> 01:18:03.200
<v Speaker 2>band members would yell at me for them </v>
<v Speaker 2>not being asked questions.</v>

1792
01:18:04.820 --> 01:18:09.820
<v Speaker 2>So there's like this weird thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it was my responsibility to push </v>

1793
01:18:09.820 --> 01:18:11.240
<v Speaker 2>them more as stars or.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1794
01:18:11.241 --> 01:18:16.241
<v Speaker 2>So it's not just about the music,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's about being appreciated and </v>

1795
01:18:16.241 --> 01:18:16.241
<v Speaker 2>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now in hindsight,</v>

1796
01:18:16.241 --> 01:18:19.760
<v Speaker 2>and in fairness to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't appreciate why it was important</v>

1797
01:18:19.761 --> 01:18:22.880
<v Speaker 2>to them because in their minds we're all</v>
<v Speaker 2>equal.</v>

1798
01:18:22.881 --> 01:18:24.560
<v Speaker 2>We're in the room together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1799
01:18:24.561 --> 01:18:25.790
<v Speaker 2>you write the songs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's cool,</v>

1800
01:18:25.791 --> 01:18:30.791
<v Speaker 2>but at least give me the social currency</v>
<v Speaker 2>of being recognized or you know,</v>

1801
01:18:32.270 --> 01:18:35.420
<v Speaker 2>or somebody would offer me alone a </v>
<v Speaker 2>magazine cover.</v>

1802
01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:37.760
<v Speaker 2>And if I was smart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I wasn't,</v>

1803
01:18:37.761 --> 01:18:39.980
<v Speaker 2>I should've said no only the band or </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>

1804
01:18:41.180 --> 01:18:42.170
<v Speaker 2>But I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure,</v>

1805
01:18:42.260 --> 01:18:43.850
<v Speaker 2>put me on the cover.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll take it.</v>

1806
01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:44.930
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1807
01:18:44.931 --> 01:18:48.410
<v Speaker 2>You probably would have saw thought they</v>
<v Speaker 2>would do the same thing if someone came.</v>

1808
01:18:48.411 --> 01:18:49.380
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1809
01:18:49.610 --> 01:18:54.610
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then of course it becomes tit for </v>

1810
01:18:54.610 --> 01:18:56.351
<v Speaker 2>tat than like a two of the band members </v>
<v Speaker 2>went on their own and made a record </v>

1811
01:18:56.351 --> 01:18:56.351
<v Speaker 2>deal.</v>

1812
01:18:56.351 --> 01:18:57.500
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>without me,</v>

1813
01:18:58.010 --> 01:19:00.410
<v Speaker 2>they got somebody to give them a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 2>of money to start a label,</v>

1814
01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:03.050
<v Speaker 2>which they had every right to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1815
01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:08.360
<v Speaker 2>So suddenly they're like making side </v>
<v Speaker 2>deals and it starts getting all that </v>

1816
01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:08.810
<v Speaker 2>weird business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And right now again,</v>

1817
01:19:08.930 --> 01:19:12.110
<v Speaker 2>it's like an erosion factor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't appreciate it from within.</v>

1818
01:19:12.111 --> 01:19:13.760
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of compression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of money,</v>

1819
01:19:13.761 --> 01:19:18.761
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of stuff going on and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>one day it's sort of hollows out and </v>

1820
01:19:18.761 --> 01:19:18.761
<v Speaker 2>then it's too late,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1821
01:19:18.761 --> 01:19:20.360
<v Speaker 2>you can't just sort of sit down and have</v>
<v Speaker 2>a meeting and make it all okay.</v>

1822
01:19:20.630 --> 01:19:23.000
<v Speaker 2>Because the wounds are deep and in our </v>
<v Speaker 2>case,</v>

1823
01:19:23.001 --> 01:19:28.001
<v Speaker 2>I mean the wounds lasted for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't talk to darcy for 17 years and </v>

1824
01:19:29.330 --> 01:19:32.750
<v Speaker 2>I didn't talk to James for I think 16.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1825
01:19:32.780 --> 01:19:34.880
<v Speaker 2>So we'd met named in the heat was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was real.</v>

1826
01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:39.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean we didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were lawsuits and all sorts of </v>

1827
01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:42.221
<v Speaker 2>stuff and it's such a common story that </v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope someone listens to this part of </v>

1828
01:19:42.221 --> 01:19:43.490
<v Speaker 2>your mission as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They won't.</v>

1829
01:19:44.900 --> 01:19:46.250
<v Speaker 2>It's just human nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1830
01:19:46.330 --> 01:19:48.740
<v Speaker 2>Because I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is power corrupts man.</v>

1831
01:19:48.860 --> 01:19:50.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

1832
01:19:51.430 --> 01:19:54.890
<v Speaker 2>no sympathy asking him today though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean when's that?</v>

1833
01:19:55.010 --> 01:20:00.010
<v Speaker 2>It wouldn't today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I feel like if you were in the </v>

1834
01:20:00.010 --> 01:20:00.560
<v Speaker 2>similar position today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd have hindsight and your favorite.</v>

1835
01:20:00.890 --> 01:20:01.440
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1836
01:20:01.441 --> 01:20:01.880
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

1837
01:20:02.260 --> 01:20:02.960
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1838
01:20:02.961 --> 01:20:07.961
<v Speaker 2>and even talking about the band going </v>
<v Speaker 2>back on a tour and the possibility that </v>

1839
01:20:07.961 --> 01:20:08.130
<v Speaker 2>it's like I approach completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>

1840
01:20:08.190 --> 01:20:09.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's what I'm saying.</v>

1841
01:20:09.991 --> 01:20:14.991
<v Speaker 3>Like power doesn't necessarily corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It corrupts if you don't know what the </v>

1842
01:20:14.991 --> 01:20:14.991
<v Speaker 3>fuck it's going to do to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1843
01:20:14.991 --> 01:20:15.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1844
01:20:15.460 --> 01:20:20.260
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not preaching for sympathy,</v>

1845
01:20:20.290 --> 01:20:25.290
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I can't speak for the modern music </v>

1846
01:20:25.290 --> 01:20:27.991
<v Speaker 2>business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the business we're in in the </v>

1847
01:20:27.991 --> 01:20:30.061
<v Speaker 2>nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were surrounded by people who were </v>

1848
01:20:30.061 --> 01:20:32.941
<v Speaker 2>giving us wrong information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now were they giving us wrong </v>

1849
01:20:32.941 --> 01:20:33.730
<v Speaker 2>information on purpose or because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>weren't bright enough?</v>

1850
01:20:33.850 --> 01:20:38.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we weren't getting the right </v>

1851
01:20:38.850 --> 01:20:40.261
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very few people actually try to sit us </v>

1852
01:20:40.261 --> 01:20:40.261
<v Speaker 2>down and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1853
01:20:40.261 --> 01:20:41.470
<v Speaker 2>this is going to be a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trust me,</v>

1854
01:20:42.900 --> 01:20:47.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like you're in there with the </v>

1855
01:20:47.900 --> 01:20:47.900
<v Speaker 2>hounds</v>

1856
01:20:47.900 --> 01:20:49.820
<v Speaker 3>just right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they probably don't have the time </v>

1857
01:20:49.820 --> 01:20:52.601
<v Speaker 3>for psychological management anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're probably in the middle of just </v>

1858
01:20:52.601 --> 01:20:52.610
<v Speaker 3>trying to figure out how to make money </v>
<v Speaker 3>off you.</v>

1859
01:20:52.620 --> 01:20:53.970
<v Speaker 3>And Maya is my understanding.</v>

1860
01:20:54.040 --> 01:20:57.130
<v Speaker 2>My understanding is they and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and again going back to the conversation</v>

1861
01:20:57.131 --> 01:20:58.810
<v Speaker 2>I had with the executive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just basically look in,</v>

1862
01:20:58.811 --> 01:21:00.370
<v Speaker 2>they say you've got four years if you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>lucky,</v>

1863
01:21:00.430 --> 01:21:02.190
<v Speaker 2>if you're lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so why are they going to,</v>

1864
01:21:03.100 --> 01:21:08.100
<v Speaker 2>why are they going to spend a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>time trying to hold your hand knowing </v>

1865
01:21:08.100 --> 01:21:08.100
<v Speaker 2>you're going to lose anyway?</v>

1866
01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:11.820
<v Speaker 3>What a crazy relationship between the </v>
<v Speaker 3>record labels and the artists.</v>

1867
01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:14.850
<v Speaker 3>It's similar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess probably like the pit boss,</v>

1868
01:21:15.180 --> 01:21:16.800
<v Speaker 3>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're having a hot run,</v>

1869
01:21:16.801 --> 01:21:21.801
<v Speaker 3>it like roulette.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The pit bosses just like enjoy it now </v>

1870
01:21:21.990 --> 01:21:24.600
<v Speaker 3>because we're going to get it back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it feels like.</v>

1871
01:21:24.870 --> 01:21:29.870
<v Speaker 3>What percentage of musicians or musical </v>
<v Speaker 3>artists that get signed by a label and </v>

1872
01:21:33.571 --> 01:21:38.571
<v Speaker 3>put something out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever wind up having an actually </v>

1873
01:21:38.571 --> 01:21:40.280
<v Speaker 3>successful career?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably less than 10 percent.</v>

1874
01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:43.140
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say it's probably even smaller.</v>

1875
01:21:43.220 --> 01:21:46.050
<v Speaker 3>A meat grinder of a business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would think like,</v>

1876
01:21:46.051 --> 01:21:48.030
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're on fucking warner brothers.</v>

1877
01:21:48.031 --> 01:21:49.080
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We made it.</v>

1878
01:21:49.230 --> 01:21:51.120
<v Speaker 3>It's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to promote us.</v>

1879
01:21:51.121 --> 01:21:51.810
<v Speaker 3>They're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Push us.</v>

1880
01:21:51.811 --> 01:21:52.710
<v Speaker 3>They signed us</v>

1881
01:21:52.750 --> 01:21:54.490
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and sorry to interrupt again,</v>

1882
01:21:54.491 --> 01:21:59.491
<v Speaker 2>but the other weird thing is the athlete</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the system I was in was even if you </v>

1883
01:22:00.221 --> 01:22:05.221
<v Speaker 2>were successful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was set up to make you feel like you </v>

1884
01:22:05.221 --> 01:22:05.221
<v Speaker 2>weren't successful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1885
01:22:05.221 --> 01:22:07.210
<v Speaker 2>Because that was the work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the manipulation.</v>

1886
01:22:08.590 --> 01:22:13.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I once said to somebody who is a very </v>

1887
01:22:13.590 --> 01:22:17.251
<v Speaker 2>famous name in the business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like you guys find a needle in the </v>

1888
01:22:17.251 --> 01:22:21.421
<v Speaker 2>haystack and then you spend the next 20 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years telling them they're not a needle </v>

1889
01:22:21.421 --> 01:22:21.421
<v Speaker 2>in the haystack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1890
01:22:21.550 --> 01:22:23.170
<v Speaker 2>It's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I'm trying to say,</v>

1891
01:22:23.171 --> 01:22:28.171
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not saying it well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is you would think you would be </v>

1892
01:22:28.171 --> 01:22:29.350
<v Speaker 2>surrounded by people are telling you </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're talented,</v>

1893
01:22:29.351 --> 01:22:32.350
<v Speaker 2>you're special.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We want to help you because the more you</v>

1894
01:22:32.351 --> 01:22:37.351
<v Speaker 2>succeed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll succeed and we'll all succeed </v>

1895
01:22:37.351 --> 01:22:37.351
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the exact opposite.</v>

1896
01:22:37.351 --> 01:22:37.351
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1897
01:22:37.351 --> 01:22:38.470
<v Speaker 2>you're dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're wrong.</v>

1898
01:22:38.770 --> 01:22:40.090
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're crazy.</v>

1899
01:22:40.270 --> 01:22:42.880
<v Speaker 2>Don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to ruin it.</v>

1900
01:22:43.570 --> 01:22:45.220
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and even if you'd say,</v>

1901
01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:47.230
<v Speaker 2>I want to wear this hat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1902
01:22:47.231 --> 01:22:48.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to wear this hat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when it wouldn't work,</v>

1903
01:22:48.971 --> 01:22:50.000
<v Speaker 2>that's say see to listen.</v>

1904
01:22:50.410 --> 01:22:53.080
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that universal?</v>

1905
01:22:53.081 --> 01:22:55.230
<v Speaker 3>Have you heard that other musicians?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have the same.</v>

1906
01:22:55.540 --> 01:22:55.640
<v Speaker 3>It</v>

1907
01:22:55.650 --> 01:22:58.510
<v Speaker 2>was universal because looking back it </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't feel personal to me.</v>

1908
01:22:58.570 --> 01:22:59.450
<v Speaker 2>It felt like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1909
01:22:59.830 --> 01:23:01.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>use your bad analogy.</v>

1910
01:23:01.601 --> 01:23:02.890
<v Speaker 2>Pimp Ho.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1911
01:23:02.970 --> 01:23:05.890
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird con thing.</v>

1912
01:23:06.460 --> 01:23:09.380
<v Speaker 2>That was my experience was a lot of con </v>
<v Speaker 2>jobs.</v>

1913
01:23:10.350 --> 01:23:13.830
<v Speaker 3>Courtney love a piece that she wrote </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the music business.</v>

1914
01:23:13.831 --> 01:23:15.690
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you're aware of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was she,</v>

1915
01:23:15.780 --> 01:23:17.040
<v Speaker 3>was it recent or.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1916
01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:19.500
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bunch of years ago where she was.</v>

1917
01:23:19.890 --> 01:23:24.890
<v Speaker 3>I think it was actually probably before </v>
<v Speaker 3>digital got really huge and it was a lot</v>

1918
01:23:26.611 --> 01:23:28.020
<v Speaker 3>of people thought she had a ghost </v>
<v Speaker 3>writer,</v>

1919
01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:33.080
<v Speaker 3>but it was really eye opening to a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of people that didn't know anything </v>

1920
01:23:33.080 --> 01:23:36.270
<v Speaker 3>about the music business,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where the money actually goes and how,</v>

1921
01:23:36.290 --> 01:23:41.190
<v Speaker 3>how much money has to be spent and how </v>
<v Speaker 3>little you actually make.</v>

1922
01:23:41.191 --> 01:23:42.810
<v Speaker 3>Even though if you sell a shit ton of </v>
<v Speaker 3>records,</v>

1923
01:23:42.811 --> 01:23:44.090
<v Speaker 3>you've never seen this spring.</v>

1924
01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:46.780
<v Speaker 2>2,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually is on salon.com.</v>

1925
01:23:47.080 --> 01:23:49.300
<v Speaker 2>It might have been one of the years we </v>
<v Speaker 2>weren't talking about.</v>

1926
01:23:49.330 --> 01:23:50.670
<v Speaker 2>They go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1927
01:23:52.660 --> 01:23:53.650
<v Speaker 2>well it's</v>

1928
01:23:53.810 --> 01:23:56.120
<v Speaker 3>for people that haven't read it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty eyeopening.</v>

1929
01:23:56.720 --> 01:23:58.820
<v Speaker 3>I've nothing to do with the music </v>
<v Speaker 3>business.</v>

1930
01:23:58.821 --> 01:24:01.940
<v Speaker 3>I've always been absolutely fascinating </v>
<v Speaker 3>as a completely objective observer.</v>

1931
01:24:01.941 --> 01:24:06.941
<v Speaker 3>Just looking at this whole thing seems </v>
<v Speaker 3>so crazy because it's if you do not get </v>

1932
01:24:07.761 --> 01:24:10.910
<v Speaker 3>signed and if you do not get promoted </v>
<v Speaker 3>until recently,</v>

1933
01:24:11.330 --> 01:24:13.190
<v Speaker 3>you had no chance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They.</v>

1934
01:24:13.230 --> 01:24:16.280
<v Speaker 3>They literally controlled the rains and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the direction of your career.</v>

1935
01:24:16.370 --> 01:24:21.370
<v Speaker 3>Almost like an actor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you can't make it as an actor </v>

1936
01:24:21.370 --> 01:24:22.100
<v Speaker 3>unless you get an audition and someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>chooses to put you in a film.</v>

1937
01:24:22.170 --> 01:24:27.170
<v Speaker 2>But like the Great Greek mythology type </v>
<v Speaker 2>myth thing that the music business has </v>

1938
01:24:27.781 --> 01:24:32.781
<v Speaker 2>made to critical mistakes over the last </v>
<v Speaker 2>30 or so years that led to its current </v>

1939
01:24:32.781 --> 01:24:37.731
<v Speaker 2>sort of reduce status.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One was they let mtv run a muck on free </v>

1940
01:24:37.731 --> 01:24:42.501
<v Speaker 2>content and when they tried to rein mtv </v>
<v Speaker 2>and MTV basically told him to take a </v>

1941
01:24:42.501 --> 01:24:47.001
<v Speaker 2>hike in the music business back down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when MTV stopped playing music </v>

1942
01:24:47.001 --> 01:24:50.961
<v Speaker 2>content,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was nothing in the music business </v>

1943
01:24:50.961 --> 01:24:50.961
<v Speaker 2>could do because they'd given away all </v>
<v Speaker 2>their leverage to the to MTV.</v>

1944
01:24:50.961 --> 01:24:55.760
<v Speaker 2>And then the second was when napster </v>
<v Speaker 2>showed up and they acted like napster </v>

1945
01:24:55.760 --> 01:24:57.360
<v Speaker 2>was a virus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they just need us to stamp out,</v>

1946
01:24:57.780 --> 01:25:02.780
<v Speaker 2>not really realizing that napster was </v>
<v Speaker 2>just the beginning of a whole wave of </v>

1947
01:25:02.780 --> 01:25:06.060
<v Speaker 2>new technologies and new sort of social </v>
<v Speaker 2>interactions or something.</v>

1948
01:25:06.390 --> 01:25:09.360
<v Speaker 2>Those two critical errors lead to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>music business.</v>

1949
01:25:09.361 --> 01:25:11.010
<v Speaker 2>Reduced position.</v>

1950
01:25:11.890 --> 01:25:14.870
<v Speaker 3>And it's this music.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean music has been around forever,</v>

1951
01:25:15.140 --> 01:25:17.820
<v Speaker 3>but the music business has been around </v>
<v Speaker 3>100.</v>

1952
01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:22.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're into 120 plus years of </v>

1953
01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:22.960
<v Speaker 2>recordings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1954
01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:24.580
<v Speaker 3>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How,</v>

1955
01:25:24.581 --> 01:25:29.581
<v Speaker 3>what a iron fist they've managed to </v>
<v Speaker 3>control the business with and,</v>

1956
01:25:29.861 --> 01:25:32.760
<v Speaker 3>and to sort of wrangle the artists for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the most,</v>

1957
01:25:32.761 --> 01:25:32.790
<v Speaker 3>most</v>

1958
01:25:32.810 --> 01:25:34.290
<v Speaker 2>part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1959
01:25:34.500 --> 01:25:35.780
<v Speaker 2>it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wizard of Oz,</v>

1960
01:25:35.790 --> 01:25:37.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>

1961
01:25:37.350 --> 01:25:37.930
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1962
01:25:38.060 --> 01:25:41.420
<v Speaker 2>don't look behind the curtain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever thought about being on the</v>

1963
01:25:41.421 --> 01:25:42.560
<v Speaker 2>other side?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1964
01:25:42.561 --> 01:25:44.090
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just don't have that much.</v>

1965
01:25:44.091 --> 01:25:49.091
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why I'm more interested in </v>

1966
01:25:49.091 --> 01:25:49.091
<v Speaker 2>wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I liked that.</v>

1967
01:25:49.091 --> 01:25:51.701
<v Speaker 2>I like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though it's this sort of weird </v>

1968
01:25:51.701 --> 01:25:53.621
<v Speaker 2>business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sort of liked that because it doesn't </v>

1969
01:25:53.621 --> 01:25:55.481
<v Speaker 2>have anything to do with music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have too much damage and too many I </v>

1970
01:25:55.481 --> 01:25:56.690
<v Speaker 2>don't think I could see clearly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does it make sense?</v>

1971
01:25:56.691 --> 01:25:59.030
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's still too weird for me.</v>

1972
01:25:59.450 --> 01:26:00.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no it does.</v>

1973
01:26:00.411 --> 01:26:04.340
<v Speaker 2>It does make sense when you first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I first to La in whatever</v>

1974
01:26:04.460 --> 01:26:06.800
<v Speaker 1>90 and had the meetings and you'd be in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1975
01:26:07.030 --> 01:26:07.570
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1976
01:26:07.580 --> 01:26:12.580
<v Speaker 1>hit the office and the people with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beards and everything and they'd be </v>

1977
01:26:12.580 --> 01:26:13.940
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when we put the product out and every</v>

1978
01:26:13.941 --> 01:26:17.270
<v Speaker 1>time they would say product,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would sort of wince product,</v>

1979
01:26:17.271 --> 01:26:20.540
<v Speaker 1>like how can you call my art product,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

1980
01:26:20.541 --> 01:26:24.290
<v Speaker 1>And that's to them it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's cookies and toilet paper.</v>

1981
01:26:24.291 --> 01:26:25.610
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's whatever.</v>

1982
01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:29.240
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's not to say they're not fans and</v>

1983
01:26:29.241 --> 01:26:31.010
<v Speaker 1>they don't appreciate or they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>care,</v>

1984
01:26:31.011 --> 01:26:33.620
<v Speaker 1>but at the end of the day it's just some</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of weird business,</v>

1985
01:26:33.621 --> 01:26:36.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like all institutional cultures that</v>

1986
01:26:36.261 --> 01:26:41.261
<v Speaker 1>are sort of kind of corrupted their </v>
<v Speaker 1>court just send it runs on its own </v>

1987
01:26:41.261 --> 01:26:41.261
<v Speaker 1>inertia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1988
01:26:41.261 --> 01:26:45.860
<v Speaker 1>it just does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you see someone like chance the </v>

1989
01:26:45.860 --> 01:26:48.641
<v Speaker 1>rapper break out of that system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think that that's a model that </v>

1990
01:26:48.641 --> 01:26:49.370
<v Speaker 1>can be followed or is he just like an </v>
<v Speaker 1>outlier?</v>

1991
01:26:50.090 --> 01:26:55.090
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly a model that can be </v>

1992
01:26:55.090 --> 01:26:55.090
<v Speaker 1>followed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1993
01:26:55.090 --> 01:26:55.090
<v Speaker 1>it probably works because he's so </v>
<v Speaker 1>talented.</v>

1994
01:26:55.090 --> 01:26:56.780
<v Speaker 1>It's like a weird combination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1995
01:26:57.050 --> 01:27:02.050
<v Speaker 1>use the mcgregor example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like how many Mcgregor's or are </v>

1996
01:27:02.050 --> 01:27:03.260
<v Speaker 1>there in the world and beyond being a </v>
<v Speaker 1>skilled fighter.</v>

1997
01:27:03.261 --> 01:27:08.261
<v Speaker 1>I mean the guys in a level talker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Speaking from a professional wresting </v>

1998
01:27:08.261 --> 01:27:11.861
<v Speaker 1>standpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guys probably the best promo in the </v>

1999
01:27:11.861 --> 01:27:11.861
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2000
01:27:11.861 --> 01:27:15.770
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the best as far as MMA guys and </v>

2001
01:27:15.770 --> 01:27:19.001
<v Speaker 1>it's also he has in this very unique </v>
<v Speaker 1>position where he has insane support </v>

2002
01:27:19.311 --> 01:27:24.311
<v Speaker 1>from Ireland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean insane that you've never seen </v>

2003
01:27:24.311 --> 01:27:27.011
<v Speaker 1>anything like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been calling fights for a long </v>

2004
01:27:27.011 --> 01:27:28.220
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been working for the UFC since 97.</v>

2005
01:27:28.550 --> 01:27:33.550
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen anybody like him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen any support like the </v>

2006
01:27:33.550 --> 01:27:35.300
<v Speaker 1>support the Irish people have for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking crazy.</v>

2007
01:27:35.900 --> 01:27:38.150
<v Speaker 1>And you see the videos of when he fought</v>
<v Speaker 1>mayweather.</v>

2008
01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:41.570
<v Speaker 1>Not even where they fought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were in Mandalay,</v>

2009
01:27:41.571 --> 01:27:45.890
<v Speaker 1>bay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Irish had flooded Mandalay bay,</v>

2010
01:27:46.080 --> 01:27:50.070
<v Speaker 1>the walkway from Mandalay Bay as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>walk towards the arena and towards where</v>

2011
01:27:50.071 --> 01:27:55.071
<v Speaker 1>they are exhibited ship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was nothing but Irish people </v>

2012
01:27:55.071 --> 01:27:58.130
<v Speaker 1>singing and it's fucking crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2013
01:27:58.310 --> 01:28:00.200
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who organize this?</v>

2014
01:28:00.201 --> 01:28:05.201
<v Speaker 1>No one who told him to start saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>things as organic as an Irish </v>

2015
01:28:05.201 --> 01:28:09.941
<v Speaker 1>descendant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know we've been waiting for a long </v>

2016
01:28:09.941 --> 01:28:09.941
<v Speaker 1>time for conor mcgregor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2017
01:28:09.941 --> 01:28:11.670
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean poets and Bondo.</v>

2018
01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:16.680
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We needed a fighter in there to someone </v>

2019
01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:16.680
<v Speaker 1>who's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2020
01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:19.730
<v Speaker 1>But to see all those people cheer and </v>
<v Speaker 1>scream.</v>

2021
01:28:19.731 --> 01:28:24.731
<v Speaker 1>And I was talking to Daniel cormier </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it this past weekend and he's </v>

2022
01:28:24.731 --> 01:28:24.830
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no one like him.</v>

2023
01:28:24.831 --> 01:28:26.060
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he loses,</v>

2024
01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:28.610
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't lose any support.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like not.</v>

2025
01:28:28.611 --> 01:28:33.611
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't change anything and people </v>
<v Speaker 1>respect the fact that he took a chance </v>

2026
01:28:33.611 --> 01:28:35.940
<v Speaker 1>and fought mayweather like can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can I ask you a Fanboy,</v>

2027
01:28:35.970 --> 01:28:40.970
<v Speaker 1>a UFC question?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it sounds like core may last Jon </v>

2028
01:28:40.970 --> 01:28:40.970
<v Speaker 1>Jones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2029
01:28:40.970 --> 01:28:45.860
<v Speaker 1>Is that okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any last [inaudible] Jon Jones was on </v>

2030
01:28:45.860 --> 01:28:45.860
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2031
01:28:45.860 --> 01:28:45.860
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2032
01:28:45.860 --> 01:28:50.291
<v Speaker 1>how does a guy like that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm asking more of a psychological </v>

2033
01:28:50.291 --> 01:28:50.291
<v Speaker 1>question because he's obviously he's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>great fighter.</v>

2034
01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:53.990
<v Speaker 1>How do you sort of process that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2035
01:28:54.440 --> 01:28:59.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean you have to really wonder why it </v>
<v Speaker 1>hasn't been established.</v>

2036
01:28:59.540 --> 01:29:01.500
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2037
01:29:01.501 --> 01:29:02.010
<v Speaker 1>So there's a lot</v>

2038
01:29:02.010 --> 01:29:04.020
<v Speaker 3>of speculation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you know the recent most</v>

2039
01:29:04.021 --> 01:29:05.970
<v Speaker 3>recent speculation that I talked about </v>
<v Speaker 3>the other day,</v>

2040
01:29:05.971 --> 01:29:10.971
<v Speaker 3>but the most recent speculation is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>John might have snorted cocaine.</v>

2041
01:29:11.221 --> 01:29:16.221
<v Speaker 3>That was cut with creatine that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>contaminated with steroids because if </v>

2042
01:29:16.741 --> 01:29:19.690
<v Speaker 3>you look at the timeline,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you look at the timeline,</v>

2043
01:29:19.730 --> 01:29:24.730
<v Speaker 3>John loves some cocaine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you look at the timeline of when </v>

2044
01:29:24.730 --> 01:29:27.960
<v Speaker 3>John tested negative and when John </v>
<v Speaker 3>tested positive,</v>

2045
01:29:27.961 --> 01:29:32.961
<v Speaker 3>it is preposterous to think that he </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought that he could take it and not </v>

2046
01:29:32.961 --> 01:29:37.080
<v Speaker 3>passed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the fight coincides with 10 days out</v>

2047
01:29:37.081 --> 01:29:40.470
<v Speaker 3>from his birthday party where he </v>
<v Speaker 3>apparently got blitzkrieg.</v>

2048
01:29:41.610 --> 01:29:43.780
<v Speaker 3>So it is entirely possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2049
01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:46.800
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is just massive speculation,</v>

2050
01:29:46.801 --> 01:29:51.801
<v Speaker 3>but we have done some research online </v>
<v Speaker 3>and found that there have been cases of </v>

2051
01:29:51.801 --> 01:29:55.650
<v Speaker 3>creatine that was contaminated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We buy cheap creatine from China,</v>

2052
01:29:55.890 --> 01:29:59.550
<v Speaker 3>contaminated with steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>specifically the type of steroid that he</v>

2053
01:29:59.551 --> 01:30:04.551
<v Speaker 3>tested positive for and create is often </v>
<v Speaker 3>use to cut cocaine apparently,</v>

2054
01:30:06.360 --> 01:30:11.360
<v Speaker 3>so it is entirely possible that he did </v>
<v Speaker 3>blow and that blow had steroids in it </v>

2055
01:30:11.550 --> 01:30:14.670
<v Speaker 3>through the contaminated creatine and </v>
<v Speaker 3>gave it back to cormay.</v>

2056
01:30:14.700 --> 01:30:18.420
<v Speaker 3>So core me a lost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The question is,</v>

2057
01:30:18.421 --> 01:30:23.010
<v Speaker 3>did he lose because Jon Jones is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>cheater or did he lose?</v>

2058
01:30:23.011 --> 01:30:28.011
<v Speaker 3>Because Jon Jones is an amazing fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the second one would be harder to </v>

2059
01:30:28.831 --> 01:30:32.160
<v Speaker 3>deal with because if you lost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because Jon Jones is an amazing fighter,</v>

2060
01:30:32.161 --> 01:30:37.161
<v Speaker 3>did coq 10 days out before their title </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight and kicked his ass and now they </v>

2061
01:30:38.101 --> 01:30:42.210
<v Speaker 3>give Daniel the title back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very weird,</v>

2062
01:30:42.450 --> 01:30:44.260
<v Speaker 3>but that's why I was asking more as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fan,</v>

2063
01:30:44.310 --> 01:30:49.140
<v Speaker 3>like a psychological perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a real fucking lie detector test.</v>

2064
01:30:49.200 --> 01:30:50.520
<v Speaker 3>That's what we need.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We do not.</v>

2065
01:30:50.550 --> 01:30:55.550
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we value honesty so much and there's </v>

2066
01:30:55.550 --> 01:30:59.870
<v Speaker 3>very little other than some rudimentary </v>
<v Speaker 3>observations they can make with Mri,</v>

2067
01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:05.280
<v Speaker 3>functional magnetic imaging,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a resonance imaging,</v>

2068
01:31:05.430 --> 01:31:08.820
<v Speaker 3>which do you want to be lie detect this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Strap me up,</v>

2069
01:31:08.821 --> 01:31:10.470
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That'd be a good podcast.</v>

2070
01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:15.560
<v Speaker 3>I try to tell the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have you done that podcast as much as </v>

2071
01:31:15.560 --> 01:31:15.560
<v Speaker 3>humanly possible ever been?</v>

2072
01:31:15.810 --> 01:31:20.010
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have you ever thought about so and so in</v>

2073
01:31:20.011 --> 01:31:25.011
<v Speaker 3>a particular way at the opportunity to </v>
<v Speaker 3>expose things that I think are fucked up</v>

2074
01:31:25.051 --> 01:31:26.790
<v Speaker 3>about me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that one,</v>

2075
01:31:26.840 --> 01:31:28.380
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2076
01:31:28.381 --> 01:31:31.080
<v Speaker 3>when it comes to like cheating in combat</v>
<v Speaker 3>sports,</v>

2077
01:31:31.380 --> 01:31:35.250
<v Speaker 3>it has such an intense significance to </v>
<v Speaker 3>it that's not,</v>

2078
01:31:35.410 --> 01:31:40.410
<v Speaker 3>it's not an option or it's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not a factor in other sports is </v>

2079
01:31:40.410 --> 01:31:41.940
<v Speaker 3>that you can cause damage to your </v>
<v Speaker 3>opponent,</v>

2080
01:31:41.941 --> 01:31:44.360
<v Speaker 3>like physical damage that could affect </v>
<v Speaker 3>them for the rest of their lives.</v>

2081
01:31:44.510 --> 01:31:49.510
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that was the case with Vito </v>

2082
01:31:49.510 --> 01:31:49.510
<v Speaker 3>Belfort,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he fought Michael Bisping,</v>

2083
01:31:49.510 --> 01:31:53.900
<v Speaker 3>he had kicked bisping and knocked him </v>
<v Speaker 3>out and bisping suffered a really badly </v>

2084
01:31:53.900 --> 01:31:57.921
<v Speaker 3>detached retina in his eye and went on </v>
<v Speaker 3>to have several surgeries and now has </v>

2085
01:31:59.230 --> 01:32:01.510
<v Speaker 3>oil in his eye.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you look at his eye,</v>

2086
01:32:01.610 --> 01:32:06.610
<v Speaker 3>there's permanent oil to protect his </v>
<v Speaker 3>retina that he has to leave in there </v>

2087
01:32:06.610 --> 01:32:07.540
<v Speaker 3>until he decides to quit fighting.</v>

2088
01:32:07.540 --> 01:32:09.190
<v Speaker 3>And then I'll have another surgery on </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2089
01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:15.000
<v Speaker 3>And the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did Vitol or land that because he's </v>

2090
01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.761
<v Speaker 3>highly skilled,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or did he land it because it's highly </v>

2091
01:32:17.761 --> 01:32:20.230
<v Speaker 3>skilled and taking testosterone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's you're,</v>

2092
01:32:20.380 --> 01:32:25.380
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you increase your ability to cause </v>

2093
01:32:25.380 --> 01:32:26.530
<v Speaker 3>damage and that changes the game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like hitting a baseball.</v>

2094
01:32:26.880 --> 01:32:31.880
<v Speaker 3>If a guy's on steroids and he hits a </v>
<v Speaker 3>baseball and his team won or your team </v>

2095
01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:34.771
<v Speaker 3>lost,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get how the team would be upset that </v>

2096
01:32:34.771 --> 01:32:36.160
<v Speaker 3>he's a cheater,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's just not the same impact.</v>

2097
01:32:36.310 --> 01:32:39.220
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't have the same ramifications </v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

2098
01:32:39.221 --> 01:32:44.221
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially when you're talking about </v>

2099
01:32:44.221 --> 01:32:45.541
<v Speaker 3>like the angle of the punch and 10th of </v>
<v Speaker 3>a second being the difference between a </v>

2100
01:32:46.871 --> 01:32:48.790
<v Speaker 3>glancing blow and a knockout.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2101
01:32:48.791 --> 01:32:53.140
<v Speaker 3>And that's what's so crazy is like you </v>
<v Speaker 3>get into this fractional idea of what is</v>

2102
01:32:53.141 --> 01:32:56.410
<v Speaker 3>just [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so many factors or speed.</v>

2103
01:32:56.770 --> 01:32:58.480
<v Speaker 3>There's the amount of energy that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have.</v>

2104
01:32:58.570 --> 01:33:01.090
<v Speaker 3>And then their psychological factors </v>
<v Speaker 3>like confidence.</v>

2105
01:33:01.450 --> 01:33:04.960
<v Speaker 3>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no metric to figure out what,</v>

2106
01:33:05.770 --> 01:33:09.280
<v Speaker 3>what kind of an effect being juiced up </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychopath has.</v>

2107
01:33:09.550 --> 01:33:14.550
<v Speaker 3>Like if you're someone who like Vito </v>
<v Speaker 3>Belfort who is already highly skilled </v>

2108
01:33:14.550 --> 01:33:16.270
<v Speaker 3>and then you pump them full of steroids </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he comes out to like,</v>

2109
01:33:16.280 --> 01:33:21.280
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he just feels like he can't lose </v>

2110
01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:23.290
<v Speaker 3>and that he has so much confidence and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then all this skill on top of that,</v>

2111
01:33:23.860 --> 01:33:25.870
<v Speaker 3>the seat he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate to pick on him,</v>

2112
01:33:25.871 --> 01:33:30.871
<v Speaker 3>but he's my favorite example because the</v>
<v Speaker 3>difference between him on testosterone </v>

2113
01:33:30.871 --> 01:33:35.260
<v Speaker 3>and him off testosterone is so radical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there has been these photos side to</v>

2114
01:33:35.261 --> 01:33:37.110
<v Speaker 3>side or the two of them together and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just like,</v>

2115
01:33:37.450 --> 01:33:42.450
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's like they're one of them's a </v>

2116
01:33:42.450 --> 01:33:42.520
<v Speaker 3>destroyer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other one is a dad,</v>

2117
01:33:42.790 --> 01:33:44.710
<v Speaker 3>like he's a dad bod,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2118
01:33:44.711 --> 01:33:45.760
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's weird.</v>

2119
01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:51.580
<v Speaker 3>So if that's the case with John Jones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will you want to pull it up as a related</v>

2120
01:33:51.581 --> 01:33:53.620
<v Speaker 3>breaking story right now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

2121
01:33:53.640 --> 01:33:56.100
<v Speaker 3>There's two to breaking stories in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>MMA world right now.</v>

2122
01:33:56.150 --> 01:33:57.840
<v Speaker 3>But this one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>since you're talking about it,</v>

2123
01:33:58.240 --> 01:34:02.710
<v Speaker 3>Anderson Silva fails out of us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>UFC Shanghai main event.</v>

2124
01:34:02.890 --> 01:34:04.270
<v Speaker 3>Make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's 40.</v>

2125
01:34:05.050 --> 01:34:07.240
<v Speaker 3>What did he fail for?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A sample?</v>

2126
01:34:07.260 --> 01:34:11.440
<v Speaker 3>A sample b test that failed from October</v>
<v Speaker 3>26th collection.</v>

2127
01:34:11.830 --> 01:34:13.270
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was a couple of weeks ago.</v>

2128
01:34:14.890 --> 01:34:19.890
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>From a sample beet test sample sample </v>

2129
01:34:19.890 --> 01:34:19.890
<v Speaker 3>collected.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2130
01:34:19.890 --> 01:34:24.810
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It didn't say the actual drug because </v>

2131
01:34:24.810 --> 01:34:25.330
<v Speaker 3>they don't test sample b unless sample a</v>
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>

2132
01:34:26.170 --> 01:34:27.550
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not surprised.</v>

2133
01:34:27.790 --> 01:34:28.950
<v Speaker 3>This is the other thing going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2134
01:34:29.030 --> 01:34:31.470
<v Speaker 3>Conor mcgregor jumps the cage at Bella </v>
<v Speaker 3>tour when he's seven.</v>

2135
01:34:31.480 --> 01:34:33.130
<v Speaker 3>Conference referee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mark Goddard.</v>

2136
01:34:33.280 --> 01:34:35.710
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I heard about that.</v>

2137
01:34:35.740 --> 01:34:38.200
<v Speaker 3>Definitely don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2138
01:34:38.201 --> 01:34:40.510
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what that was about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why he did that.</v>

2139
01:34:40.850 --> 01:34:41.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You liked that.</v>

2140
01:34:42.840 --> 01:34:46.120
<v Speaker 3>I've already.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm already booked in the main event.</v>

2141
01:34:47.050 --> 01:34:49.330
<v Speaker 3>How do you have time for that wrestling </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff?</v>

2142
01:34:49.570 --> 01:34:51.910
<v Speaker 3>Just so I just make time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Make time.</v>

<v Speaker 3>For all this fucking emo kids that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>just massive smashing pumpkins.</v>

2146
01:34:59.950 --> 01:35:04.950
<v Speaker 3>Fastest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so many of them that that must </v>

2147
01:35:04.950 --> 01:35:04.950
<v Speaker 3>drive them nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2148
01:35:04.950 --> 01:35:06.860
<v Speaker 3>That's part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's wrestling tough shit,</v>

2149
01:35:06.861 --> 01:35:08.030
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is what it is.</v>

2150
01:35:08.670 --> 01:35:10.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So to answer your question,</v>

2151
01:35:10.910 --> 01:35:12.740
<v Speaker 3>Daniel Cormier is an awesome guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2152
01:35:12.741 --> 01:35:17.741
<v Speaker 3>it really breaks my heart when I see </v>
<v Speaker 3>people get upset and boo him don't like </v>

2153
01:35:18.171 --> 01:35:20.840
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't think they know him and for</v>

2154
01:35:20.841 --> 01:35:25.580
<v Speaker 3>whatever reason he is mean to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely honest.</v>

2155
01:35:25.730 --> 01:35:30.730
<v Speaker 3>He's always going to be in the shadow of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the greatest light heavyweight champion </v>

2156
01:35:30.730 --> 01:35:30.730
<v Speaker 3>of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's John John's the greatest.</v>

2157
01:35:30.730 --> 01:35:35.710
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's so uniquely talented and special </v>

2158
01:35:35.710 --> 01:35:39.820
<v Speaker 3>and just there's something about him all</v>
<v Speaker 3>across the board and part of his </v>

2159
01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:44.920
<v Speaker 3>partying and all that shit is kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>connected to that because he's fucking </v>

2160
01:35:44.920 --> 01:35:48.281
<v Speaker 3>wild and it's one of the reasons why </v>
<v Speaker 3>when he fought shogun for the title,</v>

2161
01:35:48.561 --> 01:35:53.561
<v Speaker 3>he was 23 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He opens the fight with a flying knee </v>

2162
01:35:53.561 --> 01:35:56.570
<v Speaker 3>who fights a legend like Mauricio Shogun</v>
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>

2163
01:35:56.571 --> 01:36:01.571
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who was one of the greatest ever and </v>

2164
01:36:01.571 --> 01:36:02.660
<v Speaker 3>pride,</v>
<v Speaker 3>former light heavyweight champion at the</v>

2165
01:36:02.661 --> 01:36:05.300
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>John Jones fights him,</v>

2166
01:36:05.370 --> 01:36:09.650
<v Speaker 3>is 23 years old and is opening move is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>flying knee that lands.</v>

2167
01:36:10.040 --> 01:36:10.850
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's just,</v>

2168
01:36:11.120 --> 01:36:15.770
<v Speaker 3>he's uniquely improvisational creative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wild,</v>

2169
01:36:15.771 --> 01:36:17.720
<v Speaker 3>talented,</v>
<v Speaker 3>physically,</v>

2170
01:36:17.750 --> 01:36:22.750
<v Speaker 3>incredibly dominant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very strong kind of crazy body for the </v>

2171
01:36:22.750 --> 01:36:22.750
<v Speaker 3>game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2172
01:36:23.350 --> 01:36:23.920
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the long,</v>

2173
01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.320
<v Speaker 2>long thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Strong though,</v>

2174
01:36:26.590 --> 01:36:29.800
<v Speaker 2>he's not frail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the difference between John is he's</v>

2175
01:36:29.801 --> 01:36:33.220
<v Speaker 2>got long limbs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Buddy has that strong wrestling base,</v>

2176
01:36:33.670 --> 01:36:37.530
<v Speaker 2>so even though he's a thin guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's very physically strong.</v>

2177
01:36:37.590 --> 01:36:40.060
<v Speaker 2>Strange comparison to make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but back in the day,</v>

2178
01:36:40.061 --> 01:36:43.150
<v Speaker 2>used to hang out a lot with Dennis </v>
<v Speaker 2>Rodman when he was playing for the Bulls</v>

2179
01:36:43.300 --> 01:36:46.150
<v Speaker 2>and he had freakish strength,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of similar bonding,</v>

2180
01:36:46.151 --> 01:36:51.151
<v Speaker 2>looked very long like you wouldn't look </v>
<v Speaker 2>at them and think muscles and Rodman </v>

2181
01:36:51.431 --> 01:36:56.431
<v Speaker 2>could pick a 250 pound,</v>
<v Speaker 2>may end up with one hand and lift them </v>

2182
01:36:56.431 --> 01:37:00.030
<v Speaker 2>over a rope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw him do it at a club that was </v>

2183
01:37:00.030 --> 01:37:01.240
<v Speaker 2>acting up and Dennis just rich over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy picked him up like this.</v>

2184
01:37:01.860 --> 01:37:04.270
<v Speaker 2>And then even people would remember NBA </v>
<v Speaker 2>fans.</v>

2185
01:37:04.650 --> 01:37:09.360
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dennis used to guard the guard shack one</v>

2186
01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:10.990
<v Speaker 2>on one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2187
01:37:11.490 --> 01:37:12.680
<v Speaker 2>And that was when chuck was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

2188
01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:14.740
<v Speaker 2>3:40</v>
<v Speaker 2>years Dennis.</v>

2189
01:37:15.040 --> 01:37:16.120
<v Speaker 2>And that was when they had the whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

2190
01:37:16.121 --> 01:37:18.550
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't use your hand yet at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>elbow and all that stuff.</v>

2191
01:37:18.700 --> 01:37:21.430
<v Speaker 2>He got them one on one freakish </v>
<v Speaker 2>strength.</v>

2192
01:37:21.431 --> 01:37:22.330
<v Speaker 2>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look at him,</v>

2193
01:37:22.331 --> 01:37:23.650
<v Speaker 2>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how is that possible?</v>

2194
01:37:24.040 --> 01:37:26.020
<v Speaker 2>Some guys just have that weird </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible],</v>

2195
01:37:26.140 --> 01:37:29.260
<v Speaker 2>whatever that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of times it's those long guys</v>

2196
01:37:29.261 --> 01:37:33.430
<v Speaker 2>to something is about long limbs and </v>
<v Speaker 2>leverage and it's like they have to,</v>

2197
01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:37.540
<v Speaker 2>if they have long as they have a certain</v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of muscle with that long,</v>

2198
01:37:37.570 --> 01:37:39.610
<v Speaker 2>those long limbs and longer than </v>
<v Speaker 2>average.</v>

2199
01:37:39.620 --> 01:37:40.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at this look.</v>

2200
01:37:40.601 --> 01:37:42.840
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Freakish in this,</v>

2201
01:37:42.841 --> 01:37:47.841
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is like the air I'm hanging out </v>

2202
01:37:47.841 --> 01:37:47.841
<v Speaker 2>with Dennis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2203
01:37:47.841 --> 01:37:47.841
<v Speaker 2>look at Dennis this size compared to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Shaq.</v>

2204
01:37:47.841 --> 01:37:49.720
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you didn't know it was Dennis Rodman.</v>

2205
01:37:49.721 --> 01:37:51.030
<v Speaker 2>It was just some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2206
01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:52.450
<v Speaker 2>NBA Scrub,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2207
01:37:52.810 --> 01:37:55.230
<v Speaker 2>You would think there's no way that </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy's going to guard him one on one.</v>

2208
01:37:55.460 --> 01:37:57.840
<v Speaker 2>Especially Shaq in his prime there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no way.</v>

2209
01:37:58.350 --> 01:38:02.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a crazy guy.</v>

2210
01:38:02.710 --> 01:38:04.110
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Speaking crazy.</v>

2211
01:38:04.580 --> 01:38:06.510

<v Speaker 2>You got a good story.</v>

2212
01:38:06.540 --> 01:38:11.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So used to hang out a lot with Dennis </v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2214
01:38:11.540 --> 01:38:16.190

<v Speaker 2>Was at a restaurant in Chicago not too </v>

2215
01:38:16.190 --> 01:38:18.330
<v Speaker 2>long ago and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and somebody said,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>

2220
01:38:22.331 --> 01:38:23.790
<v Speaker 2>We go upstairs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dennis's crying.</v>

2221
01:38:23.820 --> 01:38:25.110
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I miss you guys.</v>

2222
01:38:25.111 --> 01:38:29.430
<v Speaker 2>Me and my buddy were hanging out with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling old stories,</v>

2223
01:38:29.460 --> 01:38:30.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven or eight years,</v>

2224
01:38:30.451 --> 01:38:31.830
<v Speaker 2>haven't seen him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is great.</v>

2225
01:38:31.860 --> 01:38:32.240
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2226
01:38:32.310 --> 01:38:37.310
<v Speaker 2>when you see a buddy you really love and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really affectionate and Dennis is </v>

2227
01:38:37.310 --> 01:38:39.210
<v Speaker 2>one of those people at some point he </v>
<v Speaker 2>just gets up and he wanders away.</v>

2228
01:38:39.750 --> 01:38:41.670
<v Speaker 2>I think he's going to take a piss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2229
01:38:41.850 --> 01:38:44.310
<v Speaker 2>About 10 minutes goes by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say to the waitress.</v>

2230
01:38:44.430 --> 01:38:45.450
<v Speaker 2>To Dennis leave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2231
01:38:45.451 --> 01:38:46.890
<v Speaker 2>he left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2232
01:38:46.980 --> 01:38:48.900
<v Speaker 2>I just figured he's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just the way he is.</v>

2233
01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:50.670
<v Speaker 2>He wouldn't even say goodbye.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just gone.</v>

2234
01:38:51.480 --> 01:38:53.280
<v Speaker 2>I get up the next morning I turned the </v>
<v Speaker 2>television,</v>

2235
01:38:53.520 --> 01:38:55.020
<v Speaker 2>Dennis Rodman's in North Korea.</v>

2236
01:38:58.240 --> 01:38:58.740
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

2237
01:38:58.741 --> 01:39:00.690
<v Speaker 2>I spent an hour and a half with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't say anything.</v>

2238
01:39:00.691 --> 01:39:01.950
<v Speaker 2>We'd go about going in North Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2239
01:39:02.480 --> 01:39:05.130
<v Speaker 2>So I turned on the television.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like very controversial.</v>

2240
01:39:05.131 --> 01:39:09.510
<v Speaker 2>Dennis Rodman's in North Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I texted my buddy and I say,</v>

2241
01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:15.270
<v Speaker 2>have you seen the news now what I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>turn on the television.</v>

2242
01:39:15.271 --> 01:39:16.230
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what channel?</v>

2243
01:39:16.231 --> 01:39:17.430
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter.</v>

2244
01:39:19.650 --> 01:39:23.520
<v Speaker 2>Two minutes goes by holy fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he went through the same thing,</v>

2245
01:39:23.521 --> 01:39:25.500
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2246
01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:30.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is his deal with that North Korean </v>

2247
01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:32.811
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just goes over there and hangs out </v>

2248
01:39:32.811 --> 01:39:33.230
<v Speaker 2>with them and really a genuine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2249
01:39:33.390 --> 01:39:35.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a naive hearted person.</v>

2250
01:39:36.200 --> 01:39:41.200
<v Speaker 2>So in my best understanding is he truly </v>
<v Speaker 2>believes he can affect the world in a </v>

2251
01:39:41.200 --> 01:39:43.800
<v Speaker 2>positive way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's dentists,</v>

2252
01:39:43.890 --> 01:39:47.430
<v Speaker 2>there's not a bad bone in Dennis's body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dennis has his issues,</v>

2253
01:39:47.431 --> 01:39:49.140
<v Speaker 2>but he's not a bad hearted guy.</v>

2254
01:39:49.380 --> 01:39:52.440
<v Speaker 2>So in his kind of crazy ideological </v>
<v Speaker 2>frame,</v>

2255
01:39:52.441 --> 01:39:57.441
<v Speaker 2>he actually thinks he's helping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he thinks he can go over there and </v>

2256
01:39:57.441 --> 01:39:58.820
<v Speaker 2>talk some sense into that guy or by </v>
<v Speaker 2>playing basketball open,</v>

2257
01:39:58.821 --> 01:39:59.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

2258
01:39:59.581 --> 01:40:00.910
<v Speaker 2>He's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2259
01:40:01.240 --> 01:40:03.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's not a good shot.</v>

2260
01:40:03.451 --> 01:40:04.200
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

2261
01:40:04.201 --> 01:40:05.860
<v Speaker 2>It's not a good look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

2262
01:40:05.861 --> 01:40:10.861
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's hanging around with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>murderer as dictator hoping for the </v>

2263
01:40:10.861 --> 01:40:13.671
<v Speaker 2>best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's what I mean about the </v>

2264
01:40:13.671 --> 01:40:13.671
<v Speaker 2>naivete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't mean to cache.</v>

2265
01:40:13.671 --> 01:40:13.830
<v Speaker 2>And Dennis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really loved Dennis.</v>

2266
01:40:13.831 --> 01:40:17.190
<v Speaker 2>It's been nothing but a total sweetheart</v>
<v Speaker 2>to mind to me in my life,</v>

2267
01:40:17.191 --> 01:40:22.191
<v Speaker 2>but I gen dennis would in a very naive </v>
<v Speaker 2>way believe that he's actually helping.</v>

2268
01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:25.530
<v Speaker 2>It's a very gangster move to go over </v>
<v Speaker 2>there though.</v>

2269
01:40:25.710 --> 01:40:28.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just the other side of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Dennis.</v>

2270
01:40:28.980 --> 01:40:30.090
<v Speaker 2>It makes a certain sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2271
01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:31.260
<v Speaker 2>I'll do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2272
01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:34.140
<v Speaker 2>I remember when he was dressing up in </v>
<v Speaker 2>drag and you know,</v>

2273
01:40:34.141 --> 01:40:39.141
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be that guy so it's somehow it's </v>

2274
01:40:39.141 --> 01:40:39.141
<v Speaker 2>sorta works in his.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

2275
01:40:39.141 --> 01:40:43.611
<v Speaker 2>I'm not trying to speak for him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was one of my favorite guys on </v>

2276
01:40:43.611 --> 01:40:44.750
<v Speaker 2>celebrity rehab because he was working </v>
<v Speaker 2>out every day drinking water.</v>

2277
01:40:45.570 --> 01:40:50.570
<v Speaker 2>I used to go into the bowls locker room </v>
<v Speaker 2>after games and he would work out after </v>

2278
01:40:50.570 --> 01:40:50.570
<v Speaker 2>games.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

2279
01:40:52.850 --> 01:40:57.850
<v Speaker 2>We go in and go [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to go out clubbing or </v>

2280
01:40:57.850 --> 01:41:00.121
<v Speaker 2>whatever and you go in the locker room </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he'd be working out and we have to </v>

2281
01:41:00.121 --> 01:41:02.170
<v Speaker 2>sit and wait for him to work out for </v>
<v Speaker 2>another 40 minutes after the game.</v>

2282
01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:05.020
<v Speaker 2>And he played.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't like he was had a knee injury.</v>

2283
01:41:05.021 --> 01:41:10.021
<v Speaker 2>I mean he played the whole game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what kind of workouts do you like </v>

2284
01:41:10.021 --> 01:41:12.230
<v Speaker 2>lifting weights or something treadmill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2285
01:41:12.231 --> 01:41:13.520
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever he was doing,</v>

2286
01:41:13.640 --> 01:41:15.980
<v Speaker 2>why I wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't like light stretching.</v>

2287
01:41:15.981 --> 01:41:20.981
<v Speaker 2>It was like the energizer bunny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we go out and stay out all </v>

2288
01:41:20.981 --> 01:41:20.981
<v Speaker 2>night.</v>

2289
01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:23.110
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they quick.</v>

2290
01:41:23.140 --> 01:41:26.470
<v Speaker 2>You want a quick story?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm hanging out with the bowls.</v>

2291
01:41:26.740 --> 01:41:28.470
<v Speaker 2>It's the first time they're playing </v>
<v Speaker 2>Utah.</v>

2292
01:41:29.730 --> 01:41:31.030
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2293
01:41:31.830 --> 01:41:32.910
<v Speaker 2>it's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

2294
01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:34.900
<v Speaker 2>it's a series of bolts probably should </v>
<v Speaker 2>have lost,</v>

2295
01:41:35.020 --> 01:41:37.240
<v Speaker 2>but they didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the famous game where,</v>

2296
01:41:37.320 --> 01:41:42.320
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the famous series where Michael had the </v>

2297
01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:42.320
<v Speaker 2>flu and scored 36 points.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know if you know that game,</v>

2298
01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:47.311
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the most famous games.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Michael legit had crazy flu and scored </v>

2299
01:41:47.311 --> 01:41:47.770
<v Speaker 2>36 and they won the game and they won </v>
<v Speaker 2>the series.</v>

2300
01:41:48.250 --> 01:41:52.570
<v Speaker 2>So in between one of those games,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dennis knows some billionaire,</v>

2301
01:41:53.570 --> 01:41:58.570
<v Speaker 2>there's a day off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we get on the billionaires plane and we </v>

2302
01:41:58.570 --> 01:41:59.680
<v Speaker 2>fly to Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We stay out all night gambling.</v>

2303
01:42:00.190 --> 01:42:01.250
<v Speaker 2>And this is Dennis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2304
01:42:01.990 --> 01:42:06.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rubbing dice on people's bodies and </v>

2305
01:42:06.990 --> 01:42:06.990
<v Speaker 2>throwing the dice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So drunk they're balancing out of the,</v>

2306
01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:08.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the craps pit.</v>

2307
01:42:08.140 --> 01:42:10.660
<v Speaker 2>And I mean just total mess and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking,</v>

2308
01:42:10.960 --> 01:42:12.730
<v Speaker 2>how is this going to help us win a </v>
<v Speaker 2>championship?</v>

2309
01:42:12.731 --> 01:42:17.731
<v Speaker 2>Very much a fan mentality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking naively I'm going to kind </v>

2310
01:42:17.731 --> 01:42:21.130
<v Speaker 2>of reign them in so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we stay out all night.</v>

2311
01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:23.980
<v Speaker 2>We'd get up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd never go to bed.</v>

2312
01:42:24.250 --> 01:42:27.730
<v Speaker 2>We get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we fly on the private plane,</v>

2313
01:42:27.731 --> 01:42:32.320
<v Speaker 2>back to make the morning press shoot </v>
<v Speaker 2>around back in Utah.</v>

2314
01:42:33.010 --> 01:42:38.010
<v Speaker 2>So we've only been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've only been in vegas for like eight </v>

2315
01:42:38.010 --> 01:42:38.010
<v Speaker 2>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So 9:00</v>

2316
01:42:38.010 --> 01:42:38.740
<v Speaker 2>AM.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sitting in the stands.</v>

2317
01:42:38.830 --> 01:42:42.550
<v Speaker 2>I haven't slept at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do the whatever,</v>

2318
01:42:42.551 --> 01:42:45.910
<v Speaker 2>the shoot around and Dennis walks up and</v>
<v Speaker 2>says let's go back,</v>

2319
01:42:45.970 --> 01:42:49.690
<v Speaker 2>go back where the hotel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No let's go back to Vegas.</v>

2320
01:42:50.560 --> 01:42:55.560
<v Speaker 2>So after the morning shoot around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drove to the airport to fly commercial </v>

2321
01:42:55.560 --> 01:42:59.521
<v Speaker 2>because now the billionaires not sliding</v>
<v Speaker 2>them back again and gets on a plane </v>

2322
01:42:59.521 --> 01:43:02.170
<v Speaker 2>commercial and it's given me shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I don't want to go back to vegas</v>

2323
01:43:02.171 --> 01:43:02.560
<v Speaker 2>with him.</v>

2324
01:43:03.010 --> 01:43:07.300
<v Speaker 2>Jesus kron the off day and this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>during the NBA,</v>

2325
01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:11.050
<v Speaker 2>the NBA finals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So through some sort of weird,</v>

2326
01:43:11.270 --> 01:43:14.050
<v Speaker 2>you know how the world works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ended up somewhere,</v>

2327
01:43:15.490 --> 01:43:17.770
<v Speaker 2>I don't play,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go to play miniature golf or something</v>

2328
01:43:17.771 --> 01:43:22.771
<v Speaker 2>in Park City,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Utah where the bowls were staying and </v>

2329
01:43:22.771 --> 01:43:25.381
<v Speaker 2>Phil Jackson and his family's had just </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened to be there on like an off day </v>

2330
01:43:25.381 --> 01:43:29.010
<v Speaker 2>and Phil has given me the look of death </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'm the one responsible for </v>

2331
01:43:29.010 --> 01:43:33.541
<v Speaker 2>dentists go into Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The rockstar dragged on the bad guy and </v>

2332
01:43:33.660 --> 01:43:34.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't understand.</v>

2333
01:43:34.990 --> 01:43:38.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm the one to tell him not to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to win a championship or at least</v>

2334
01:43:38.591 --> 01:43:40.990
<v Speaker 2>have one now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you gonna say to Phil Jackson?</v>

2335
01:43:41.020 --> 01:43:44.350
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever met Phil Jackson?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Phil Jackson is an intimidating guy.</v>

2336
01:43:45.860 --> 01:43:48.280
<v Speaker 2>He plays very zen on tv,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in person.</v>

2337
01:43:48.281 --> 01:43:49.840
<v Speaker 2>He's very intimidating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Six,</v>

2338
01:43:49.850 --> 01:43:50.950
<v Speaker 2>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six,</v>

2339
01:43:50.960 --> 01:43:53.120
<v Speaker 2>eight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was legitimately upset at you.</v>

2340
01:43:54.350 --> 01:43:59.330
<v Speaker 2>Let's just say it wasn't a nice </v>
<v Speaker 2>encounter and I love Phil Jackson.</v>

2341
01:43:59.331 --> 01:44:00.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I loved those years.</v>

2342
01:44:00.771 --> 01:44:03.830
<v Speaker 2>I love those teams and I was lucky to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>around them a lot.</v>

2343
01:44:03.950 --> 01:44:04.910
<v Speaker 2>I used to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2344
01:44:05.210 --> 01:44:07.760
<v Speaker 2>watching this teams like 19,</v>
<v Speaker 2>27 Yankees,</v>

2345
01:44:07.761 --> 01:44:12.761
<v Speaker 2>I mean you will look back very fondly on</v>
<v Speaker 2>this time and to even be in that bubble </v>

2346
01:44:12.761 --> 01:44:14.810
<v Speaker 2>at all and it was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

2347
01:44:14.811 --> 01:44:18.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean catch and shade from Phil Jackson</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the height of the Bolus thing.</v>

2348
01:44:18.801 --> 01:44:21.160
<v Speaker 2>It was just so funny and I'm playing </v>
<v Speaker 2>miniature golf and you know,</v>

2349
01:44:21.210 --> 01:44:23.960
<v Speaker 2>this is so uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is hilarious.</v>

2350
01:44:24.320 --> 01:44:26.540
<v Speaker 2>Do you still keep in touch with Dennis </v>
<v Speaker 2>now?</v>

2351
01:44:26.541 --> 01:44:31.541
<v Speaker 2>Dennis is sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He kind of tried it out into the ether </v>

2352
01:44:31.541 --> 01:44:31.541
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2353
01:44:31.541 --> 01:44:33.800
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to follow it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It under my thing.</v>

2354
01:44:33.801 --> 01:44:36.050
<v Speaker 2>It falls under what I call the celeb </v>
<v Speaker 2>friendship.</v>

2355
01:44:36.850 --> 01:44:40.100
<v Speaker 2>I've had various times had to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried to have friendships,</v>

2356
01:44:40.101 --> 01:44:44.630
<v Speaker 2>legitimate friendships with very famous </v>
<v Speaker 2>people and the way they run their worlds</v>

2357
01:44:44.660 --> 01:44:46.580
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you've encountered.</v>

2358
01:44:46.581 --> 01:44:48.680
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like you got to go through this guy</v>

2359
01:44:48.681 --> 01:44:51.470
<v Speaker 2>to talk to this guy and then the message</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't get through and I think,</v>

2360
01:44:51.500 --> 01:44:52.880
<v Speaker 2>oh fuck all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doing that.</v>

2361
01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:53.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

2362
01:44:54.080 --> 01:44:56.690
<v Speaker 3>If I can't just text you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't be friends with.</v>

2363
01:44:56.800 --> 01:44:58.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gets into the weird thing of like,</v>

2364
01:44:59.050 --> 01:45:04.050
<v Speaker 2>you tell Larry the guy and then Larry </v>
<v Speaker 2>never tells the guy and then the guy's </v>

2365
01:45:04.050 --> 01:45:06.010
<v Speaker 2>upset at Larry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Larry's looking at you like,</v>

2366
01:45:06.070 --> 01:45:08.400
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had to go do this thing and I just,</v>

2367
01:45:08.710 --> 01:45:09.610
<v Speaker 2>I can't do any of that.</v>

2368
01:45:09.660 --> 01:45:11.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a few guys that are like that,</v>

2369
01:45:11.551 --> 01:45:12.660
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a few.</v>

2370
01:45:12.870 --> 01:45:14.010
<v Speaker 3>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

2371
01:45:14.011 --> 01:45:17.940
<v Speaker 3>I feel like when someone reaches a </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain level of success,</v>

2372
01:45:18.030 --> 01:45:19.570
<v Speaker 3>especially fame,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2373
01:45:19.770 --> 01:45:24.770
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get people to sort of handle </v>

2374
01:45:24.770 --> 01:45:27.180
<v Speaker 3>certain menial tasks and then that </v>
<v Speaker 3>person sort of becomes their babysitter.</v>

2375
01:45:29.030 --> 01:45:34.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have very few friends that are famous </v>

2376
01:45:34.030 --> 01:45:34.290
<v Speaker 2>and it's one on one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2377
01:45:34.310 --> 01:45:35.370
<v Speaker 2>Or forget it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2378
01:45:35.420 --> 01:45:37.340
<v Speaker 2>the with David.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I'm a fan.</v>

2379
01:45:37.700 --> 01:45:39.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean there are people I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2380
01:45:39.411 --> 01:45:43.250
<v Speaker 2>I could call them up kind of thing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're like my absolute idols,</v>

2381
01:45:43.430 --> 01:45:45.380
<v Speaker 2>but if I can't have that rapport,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

2382
01:45:45.381 --> 01:45:46.160
<v Speaker 2>forget it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

2383
01:45:46.180 --> 01:45:47.860
<v Speaker 2>it's almost too weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2384
01:45:48.140 --> 01:45:53.140
<v Speaker 2>because why then am I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>am I a fan guy hanging around hope and </v>

2385
01:45:53.140 --> 01:45:55.220
<v Speaker 2>he's going to throw me a bone and talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>to me about their second album.</v>

2386
01:45:55.221 --> 01:46:00.221
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's like it gets into that kind of </v>

2387
01:46:00.221 --> 01:46:00.221
<v Speaker 2>uncomfortable space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

2388
01:46:00.221 --> 01:46:00.290
<v Speaker 2>you're making the same mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want people to make.</v>

2389
01:46:00.860 --> 01:46:05.860
<v Speaker 2>I don't want people around me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like some of my friends were in the </v>

2390
01:46:05.860 --> 01:46:07.961
<v Speaker 2>room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They talked to me like I'm the guy from </v>

2391
01:46:07.961 --> 01:46:09.080
<v Speaker 2>Glendale Heights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's no star trip with me.</v>

2392
01:46:09.170 --> 01:46:12.140
<v Speaker 2>Like I want everyone to be straight up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want any of that.</v>

2393
01:46:12.170 --> 01:46:14.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't need it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2394
01:46:14.091 --> 01:46:14.620
<v Speaker 2>it's like what you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're</v>

2395
01:46:14.660 --> 01:46:16.820
<v Speaker 3>talking about turning 50,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2396
01:46:16.821 --> 01:46:18.860
<v Speaker 3>like you're 50,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't give a fuck anymore.</v>

2397
01:46:18.890 --> 01:46:21.570
<v Speaker 3>It's like that's one of the things I did</v>
<v Speaker 3>give a fuck before 50,</v>

2398
01:46:21.590 --> 01:46:22.940
<v Speaker 3>but now you have to declare it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2399
01:46:23.330 --> 01:46:27.920
<v Speaker 3>But it's great that you are willing to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be this guy and be yourself openly.</v>

2400
01:46:27.921 --> 01:46:31.040
<v Speaker 3>Because one of the things about music in</v>
<v Speaker 3>particular,</v>

2401
01:46:31.041 --> 01:46:33.410
<v Speaker 3>but I guess a lot of other areas of show</v>
<v Speaker 3>business too,</v>

2402
01:46:33.620 --> 01:46:37.310
<v Speaker 3>is that people really protect that </v>
<v Speaker 3>image.</v>

2403
01:46:37.340 --> 01:46:39.980
<v Speaker 3>They protect that brand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they protect that,</v>

2404
01:46:40.190 --> 01:46:42.260
<v Speaker 3>that thing that they're projecting to </v>
<v Speaker 3>their fans,</v>

2405
01:46:42.410 --> 01:46:46.610
<v Speaker 3>they have this idea what their fans want</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they hold that really sacred.</v>

2406
01:46:46.611 --> 01:46:49.890
<v Speaker 3>But I think pulling the curtain back the</v>
<v Speaker 3>way you do,</v>

2407
01:46:49.891 --> 01:46:49.980
<v Speaker 3>I</v>

2408
01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:52.300
<v Speaker 1>think it's very brave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also very</v>

2409
01:46:52.440 --> 01:46:57.440
<v Speaker 2>port.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've certainly had moments in my life </v>

2410
01:46:57.440 --> 01:47:01.131
<v Speaker 2>where I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wondered if I had it to do all over </v>

2411
01:47:01.131 --> 01:47:01.131
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like sometimes I'll,</v>

2412
01:47:01.131 --> 01:47:01.200
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll riff with a,</v>

2413
01:47:01.201 --> 01:47:06.201
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a journalist that I know enough to sort </v>

2414
01:47:06.201 --> 01:47:06.930
<v Speaker 2>of riff with and I say because sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll say like,</v>

2415
01:47:07.440 --> 01:47:12.440
<v Speaker 2>do you feel you're under appreciated as </v>
<v Speaker 2>an artist or you didn't feel you didn't </v>

2416
01:47:12.440 --> 01:47:12.570
<v Speaker 2>get to do you to serve?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

2417
01:47:12.571 --> 01:47:13.810
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's absolutely.</v>

2418
01:47:13.811 --> 01:47:16.230
<v Speaker 2>And maybe everybody feels that way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I certainly feel that way.</v>

2419
01:47:16.500 --> 01:47:19.640
<v Speaker 2>And so my little funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sec,</v>

2420
01:47:19.660 --> 01:47:24.660
<v Speaker 2>a blog question for them as if I'd never</v>
<v Speaker 2>opened my mouth and all you had on me </v>

2421
01:47:25.501 --> 01:47:28.160
<v Speaker 2>was my music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you have a different opinion?</v>

2422
01:47:28.200 --> 01:47:29.520
<v Speaker 2>And they say they always say the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

2423
01:47:29.560 --> 01:47:32.190
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's weird,</v>

2424
01:47:32.191 --> 01:47:32.820
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2425
01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:35.840
<v Speaker 2>So did my mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2426
01:47:35.850 --> 01:47:36.510
<v Speaker 2>boot me down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2427
01:47:36.560 --> 01:47:38.420
<v Speaker 1>Ladder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

2428
01:47:38.450 --> 01:47:39.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2429
01:47:39.150 --> 01:47:40.790
<v Speaker 1>it's fun to play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a part of the game.</v>

2430
01:47:40.791 --> 01:47:41.760
<v Speaker 1>It's too late now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2431
01:47:41.940 --> 01:47:46.940
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a different opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a lesser or greater </v>

2432
01:47:46.940 --> 01:47:46.940
<v Speaker 1>opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2433
01:47:46.940 --> 01:47:49.010
<v Speaker 1>my opinion of you is greater seeing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are very open,</v>

2434
01:47:49.280 --> 01:47:51.170
<v Speaker 1>honest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if I knew you,</v>

2435
01:47:51.470 --> 01:47:54.470
<v Speaker 1>like if I didn't know you have your </v>
<v Speaker 1>music.</v>

2436
01:47:54.530 --> 01:47:55.280
<v Speaker 1>Oh go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2437
01:47:55.281 --> 01:47:56.810
<v Speaker 1>he's a regular guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd been.</v>

2438
01:47:56.811 --> 01:47:59.790
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people don't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't like regular guys know.</v>

2439
01:48:00.140 --> 01:48:02.270
<v Speaker 1>It's a fantasy world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2440
01:48:02.271 --> 01:48:03.920
<v Speaker 1>That's part of the music business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2441
01:48:04.250 --> 01:48:06.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to ask you this one thing for sure</v>

2442
01:48:07.300 --> 01:48:09.770
<v Speaker 1>is because I read this and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

2443
01:48:10.880 --> 01:48:11.670
<v Speaker 1>Here we go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2444
01:48:11.840 --> 01:48:16.840
<v Speaker 1>you saw someone shapeshift Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it,</v>

2445
01:48:20.380 --> 01:48:22.070
<v Speaker 1>is that really where you fucking with </v>
<v Speaker 1>people?</v>

2446
01:48:22.071 --> 01:48:23.310
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

2447
01:48:23.320 --> 01:48:28.320
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because when you told me joy Kaufman </v>

2448
01:48:28.320 --> 01:48:28.370
<v Speaker 1>like moments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2449
01:48:28.380 --> 01:48:28.730
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2450
01:48:28.731 --> 01:48:29.510
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's true.</v>

2451
01:48:29.920 --> 01:48:32.170
<v Speaker 2>I would tell you off grade,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I won't say it publicly.</v>

2452
01:48:32.260 --> 01:48:34.480
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only way I'd say it publicly as if I</v>

2453
01:48:34.481 --> 01:48:38.320
<v Speaker 2>write it and I've been writing this book</v>
<v Speaker 2>for years and it's in the book really.</v>

2454
01:48:38.340 --> 01:48:40.930
<v Speaker 2>So I'd tell you off grid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can't get.</v>

2455
01:48:41.440 --> 01:48:44.740
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know Alex Jones sat in the seat,</v>

2456
01:48:46.180 --> 01:48:48.840
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you've been on it for wars.</v>

2457
01:48:48.841 --> 01:48:51.990
<v Speaker 1>I've been in I think three or four </v>
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>

2458
01:48:54.070 --> 01:48:56.240
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what have you been on them for?</v>

2459
01:48:56.260 --> 01:48:56.750
<v Speaker 1>Is for.</v>

2460
01:48:56.850 --> 01:48:59.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm mostly talking about free speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's,</v>

2461
01:48:59.940 --> 01:49:01.860
<v Speaker 2>I think that's one thing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2462
01:49:01.890 --> 01:49:03.330
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

2463
01:49:03.390 --> 01:49:06.390
<v Speaker 2>is critical and alternative media is to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight that.</v>

2464
01:49:06.420 --> 01:49:09.720
<v Speaker 2>That's a frontline issue for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2465
01:49:09.750 --> 01:49:12.010
<v Speaker 2>This demonetizing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2466
01:49:12.011 --> 01:49:16.910
<v Speaker 2>people's videos and trying to censor </v>
<v Speaker 2>messages and even how in to twitter exec</v>

2467
01:49:16.920 --> 01:49:21.920
<v Speaker 2>just recently admitted in front of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Congress how they were suppressing a </v>

2468
01:49:21.920 --> 01:49:23.070
<v Speaker 2>negative hillary hashtags and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2469
01:49:23.071 --> 01:49:24.540
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

2470
01:49:24.930 --> 01:49:29.930
<v Speaker 2>I think so too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That like you got some of you openly </v>

2471
01:49:29.930 --> 01:49:29.930
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2472
01:49:29.930 --> 01:49:29.930
<v Speaker 2>we were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2473
01:49:29.930 --> 01:49:31.830
<v Speaker 2>if we're going to sit here and go on and</v>
<v Speaker 2>on about Russian collusion,</v>

2474
01:49:31.831 --> 01:49:35.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that not an in kind donation,</v>

2475
01:49:35.450 --> 01:49:40.450
<v Speaker 2>will you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're manipulating people's ability to </v>

2476
01:49:40.450 --> 01:49:40.450
<v Speaker 2>change it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as an artist who's been in the public</v>

2477
01:49:40.450 --> 01:49:45.201
<v Speaker 2>sphere almost 30 years and I've seen </v>
<v Speaker 2>people manipulate my image and turn me </v>

2478
01:49:45.201 --> 01:49:49.251
<v Speaker 2>into a meme and all this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very sensitive to if somebody wants </v>

2479
01:49:49.251 --> 01:49:53.161
<v Speaker 2>to deny me the right to re to either </v>
<v Speaker 2>reply or get my message out,</v>

2480
01:49:54.030 --> 01:49:56.590
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>As long as we have that ability,</v>

2481
01:49:56.591 --> 01:50:01.591
<v Speaker 2>I trust our democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need people like you and me and </v>

2482
01:50:01.591 --> 01:50:04.600
<v Speaker 2>anybody else like great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think our democracy is better for it.</v>

2483
01:50:04.960 --> 01:50:09.960
<v Speaker 2>And that includes the people who say </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that I don't approve of or like </v>

2484
01:50:09.960 --> 01:50:10.060
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather have them say it than not </v>
<v Speaker 2>safe.</v>

2485
01:50:10.180 --> 01:50:15.180
<v Speaker 3>I agree as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think it's very important that if </v>

2486
01:50:15.180 --> 01:50:17.010
<v Speaker 3>people do say those things that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't approve of or like that other </v>

2487
01:50:17.010 --> 01:50:20.440
<v Speaker 3>people express why they don't approve of</v>
<v Speaker 3>those things are like them.</v>

2488
01:50:20.441 --> 01:50:22.960
<v Speaker 3>And the only way that happens is if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>hear the initial thought,</v>

2489
01:50:23.320 --> 01:50:26.170
<v Speaker 3>you have to hear the one thing that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't like in order for someone to say,</v>

2490
01:50:26.171 --> 01:50:27.760
<v Speaker 3>saying something that resonates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go,</v>

2491
01:50:27.761 --> 01:50:32.761
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why we disagree with that </v>

2492
01:50:32.761 --> 01:50:32.761
<v Speaker 3>initiative.</v>

2493
01:50:32.761 --> 01:50:32.761
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to use any personnel,</v>

2494
01:50:32.761 --> 01:50:34.010
<v Speaker 2>if we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we generally agree,</v>

2495
01:50:34.011 --> 01:50:39.011
<v Speaker 2>than an idea is so aborad or so racist </v>
<v Speaker 2>are so bigoted than what are we afraid </v>

2496
01:50:39.951 --> 01:50:44.951
<v Speaker 2>of because the argument should be that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the collective agrees that that is an </v>

2497
01:50:45.951 --> 01:50:50.270
<v Speaker 2>inappropriate thing to do and express </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then socially we can sort of correct</v>

2498
01:50:50.390 --> 01:50:53.690
<v Speaker 2>course and it gives the other person on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the other side the opportunity to course</v>

2499
01:50:53.691 --> 01:50:56.870
<v Speaker 2>correct to yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In essence,</v>

2500
01:50:57.020 --> 01:51:02.020
<v Speaker 2>if you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're so sure of an idea of being </v>

2501
01:51:02.020 --> 01:51:02.020
<v Speaker 2>true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you afraid of?</v>

2502
01:51:02.020 --> 01:51:06.700
<v Speaker 2>Why can that idea not withstand the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dirtiest most scurrilous thing that can </v>

2503
01:51:06.921 --> 01:51:07.520
<v Speaker 2>be thrown at it?</v>

2504
01:51:07.990 --> 01:51:12.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the more uncomfortable </v>

2505
01:51:12.990 --> 01:51:14.551
<v Speaker 3>things about people on the left today is</v>
<v Speaker 3>this newly embraced idea that you should</v>

2506
01:51:14.770 --> 01:51:16.960
<v Speaker 3>be able to suppress ideas you don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>agree with.</v>

2507
01:51:17.290 --> 01:51:18.880
<v Speaker 3>That's terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is terrifying.</v>

2508
01:51:18.881 --> 01:51:19.780
<v Speaker 3>It's terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

2509
01:51:20.200 --> 01:51:25.200
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's wrap this up so I could hear your </v>

2510
01:51:25.200 --> 01:51:25.200
<v Speaker 3>shape shifts or.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>

2511
01:51:25.200 --> 01:51:25.200
<v Speaker 3>I want to Elena,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hear that man.</v>

2512
01:51:25.200 --> 01:51:26.500
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's put it this way.</v>

2513
01:51:26.560 --> 01:51:28.330
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty wild.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe you.</v>

2514
01:51:28.520 --> 01:51:30.910
<v Speaker 3>I just the people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will.</v>

2515
01:51:30.911 --> 01:51:31.630
<v Speaker 3>I will.</v>
