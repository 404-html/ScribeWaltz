00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.230

119
00:03:46.231 --> 00:03:46.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

00:03:48.611 --> 00:03:50.010
<v Speaker 1>Most people don't know that.</v>

124
00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.560
<v Speaker 1>Most people don't know when that a press conference with Nist,</v>

125
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.630
<v Speaker 1>the National Institute of Standards and technologies,</v>

126
00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.620
<v Speaker 1>they're the ones that came out and explained what happened.</v>

127
00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:58.270
<v Speaker 1>Tower something.</v>

128
00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:59.730
<v Speaker 1>When they asked him why didn't,</v>

129
00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.340
<v Speaker 1>did you guys check for closeups?</v>

130
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:04.810
<v Speaker 1>It's really simple.</v>

131
00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:05.890
<v Speaker 1>It's like kindergarten shit.</v>

132
00:04:05.891 --> 00:04:07.450
<v Speaker 1>When they asked the head of kindergarten,</v>

133
00:04:07.451 --> 00:04:09.790
<v Speaker 1>why didn't you check for explosives?</v>

134
00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.160
<v Speaker 1>Why didn't you test for explosives on tower seven?</v>

135
00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.080
<v Speaker 1>They said there was no reason to.</v>

136
00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.940
<v Speaker 1>That was no taste,</v>

137
00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:16.660
<v Speaker 1>no witnesses.</v>

138
00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:17.470
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

139
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.600
<v Speaker 1>there's about an hour of witnesses,</v>

140
00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:20.201
<v Speaker 1>firemen,</v>

141
00:04:20.201 --> 00:04:21.940
<v Speaker 1>policemen saying bombs went off.</v>

142
00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.820
<v Speaker 1>There's video of what's going on.</v>

143
00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.853
<v Speaker 1>And the guy said,</v>

144
00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.900
<v Speaker 1>we didn't check for bombs because there was no witness.</v>

145
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.810
<v Speaker 1>What about that honey who flew those planes?</v>

146
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:38.411
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>

147
00:04:38.411 --> 00:04:39.370
<v Speaker 1>Anybody can say.</v>

148

225
00:07:22.251 --> 00:07:23.600
<v Speaker 1>we're not really controlling the media.</v>

226
00:07:23.601 --> 00:07:24.500

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:58.130
<v Speaker 1>That's so funny.</v>

250
00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.470
<v Speaker 1>I just saw the documentary sugarcoated.</v>

251
00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:01.221

257
00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:06.890
<v Speaker 1>this is one that I've watched over and over.</v>

258
00:08:06.891 --> 00:08:07.730
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>

259
00:08:07.731 --> 00:08:08.260
<v Speaker 1>really good.</v>

260
00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:09.260
<v Speaker 1>If you say it's the best of all.</v>

261
00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:10.311
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

262
00:08:10.311 --> 00:08:10.730
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

263
00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:11.151
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

264
00:08:11.151 --> 00:08:11.781
<v Speaker 1>But it's really,</v>

265
00:08:11.781 --> 00:08:12.614
<v Speaker 1>really good because,</v>

266
00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:14.480
<v Speaker 1>especially for conspiracy theorist type,</v>

267
00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:17.150
<v Speaker 1>it's called how big oil conquered the world.</v>

268
00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:20.000
<v Speaker 1>There's a documentary called the fence will blow your fucking mind.</v>

269
00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:20.960
<v Speaker 1>They never finished that.</v>

270
00:08:20.961 --> 00:08:21.794
<v Speaker 1>They abandoned it.</v>

271
00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:22.820
<v Speaker 1>It's deserted.</v>

272
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:23.960
<v Speaker 1>Mexican dudes are going,</v>

273
00:08:23.961 --> 00:08:25.160

<v Speaker 1>I'm just like,</v>

276
00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:28.003

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:33.100
<v Speaker 1>This documentary's called about the birth of oil and how it came in and infected</v>

278
00:08:33.141 --> 00:08:37.970

<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

296
00:08:54.741 --> 00:08:55.574
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>

297
00:08:58.090 --> 00:08:59.560
<v Speaker 1>The Sugar Association.</v>

298
00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:03.700
<v Speaker 1>They didn't want it to be labeled as for what it really was,</v>

299
00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:04.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

300
00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:04.511
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

301
00:09:04.511 --> 00:09:05.890
<v Speaker 1>an addictive toxin.</v>

302
00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:07.210
<v Speaker 1>They want her to keep it at.</v>

303
00:09:07.211 --> 00:09:08.740
<v Speaker 1>Ain't that bad in moderation.</v>

304
00:09:08.741 --> 00:09:09.640
<v Speaker 1>It ain't that bad.</v>

305
00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:11.110
<v Speaker 1>It makes things taste sweet.</v>

306
00:09:11.111 --> 00:09:11.944
<v Speaker 1>It's about love.</v>

307
00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:13.570
<v Speaker 1>They tell you,</v>

308
00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:17.170
<v Speaker 1>they tell you we don't know shit.</v>

309
00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:20.110
<v Speaker 1>We're looking at a bunch of lights and the God,</v>

310
00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:20.880
<v Speaker 1>Scott,</v>

311
00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:25.780
<v Speaker 1>you're going to tell me that that light and that light that's 250 a hundred</v>

312
00:09:25.781 --> 00:09:27.370
<v Speaker 1>trillion light years away.</v>

313
00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:29.530
<v Speaker 1>How the fuck did you figure that out?</v>

314
00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:30.240
<v Speaker 1>Learned.</v>

315
00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:30.370
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

316
00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:31.930
<v Speaker 1>don't they have an explanation for that shit?</v>

317
00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:32.291
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

318
00:09:32.291 --> 00:09:32.951
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

319
00:09:32.951 --> 00:09:34.820
<v Speaker 1>That's what every what you just said right now.</v>

320
00:09:34.821 --> 00:09:35.561
<v Speaker 1>But what you just said,</v>

321
00:09:35.561 --> 00:09:36.250
<v Speaker 1>now's what?</v>

322
00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:37.780
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's natural reaction.</v>

323
00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.690
<v Speaker 1>Cause anytime someone says anything about space,</v>

324
00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:45.100
<v Speaker 1>you automatically think someone figured it out.</v>

325
00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:46.510
<v Speaker 1>You don't know the guy's name.</v>

326
00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:48.190
<v Speaker 1>You don't know the name of the experiment.</v>

327
00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:49.840
<v Speaker 1>You didn't look into it yourself.</v>

328
00:09:49.841 --> 00:09:53.740
<v Speaker 1>You just think when someone tells you how far is the earth from the sun?</v>

329
00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:57.280
<v Speaker 1>Oh say oh 93 million miles away.</v>

330
00:09:57.550 --> 00:09:58.620
<v Speaker 1>Like you just write.</v>

331
00:09:58.690 --> 00:09:59.440
<v Speaker 1>You will.</v>

332
00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:04.440
<v Speaker 1>Everybody relies on someone figured that out and someone double checked it.</v>

333
00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:06.311
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

334
00:10:06.311 --> 00:10:07.150
<v Speaker 1>it's math,</v>

335
00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.110
<v Speaker 1>it's science,</v>

336
00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:08.770
<v Speaker 1>it's math.</v>

337
00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:10.000
<v Speaker 1>But no one really knows.</v>

338
00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:11.013
<v Speaker 1>So they,</v>

339
00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:13.480
<v Speaker 1>they paid according to this documentary,</v>

340
00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:14.520
<v Speaker 1>they paid off Harvey.</v>

341
00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:14.681
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

342
00:10:14.681 --> 00:10:15.260
<v Speaker 1>cause everyone's like,</v>

343
00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:16.093
<v Speaker 1>I'm flying,</v>

344
00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:16.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm science.</v>

345
00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:16.961
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

346
00:10:16.961 --> 00:10:17.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm science.</v>

347
00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:20.650
<v Speaker 1>That it's beautiful when people do that because then all you do is buy off all</v>

348
00:10:20.651 --> 00:10:22.240
<v Speaker 1>the scientists and you got everybody.</v>

349
00:10:22.241 --> 00:10:23.260
<v Speaker 1>I love some sugar though,</v>

350
00:10:23.261 --> 00:10:23.500
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

351
00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:23.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

352
00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:24.640
<v Speaker 1>we can all be bullshit.</v>

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:27.490
<v Speaker 1>Those documentaries gate so juiced up.</v>

354

356
00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:30.040
<v Speaker 1>They seem so good.</v>

357
00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:31.270
<v Speaker 1>They seem so real.</v>

358
00:10:31.271 --> 00:10:33.820
<v Speaker 1>You get fired up and then once you get fired up,</v>

359
00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:35.320
<v Speaker 1>it's tough to get unfired up.</v>

360
00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:38.350
<v Speaker 1>I want to be in the Goddamn it a little naughty if their Goddamn,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

388
00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:24.810
<v Speaker 1>if I would get that fucking oil from Alaska,</v>

389
00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:26.670
<v Speaker 1>I would go in there and make it,</v>

390
00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:27.541

<v Speaker 1>Blue whale was a national trend.</v>

399
00:11:39.181 --> 00:11:39.960
<v Speaker 1>None of these things are true.</v>

400
00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:40.980
<v Speaker 1>It has to be frustrating.</v>

401
00:11:40.981 --> 00:11:41.880
<v Speaker 1>Eddie to believe something.</v>

00:12:22.991 --> 00:12:23.651
<v Speaker 1>I cleaned them out.</v>

417
00:12:23.651 --> 00:12:24.161
<v Speaker 1>It's a filter.</v>

418
00:12:24.161 --> 00:12:25.480
<v Speaker 1>I needed to clean those fuckers out.</v>

419
00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:27.760
<v Speaker 1>Someone did come up to me and say,</v>

420

<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Have you heard about this?</v>

423
00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:37.150
<v Speaker 1>There's a conspiracy theory where there's no chorus.</v>

424
00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:38.763
<v Speaker 1>Look into it.</v>

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:54.690

680
00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:56.250
<v Speaker 1>What if,</v>

681
00:20:56.250 --> 00:21:00.790
<v Speaker 1>what if you could figure out how long it takes to kill someone with the choke</v>

682
00:21:00.791 --> 00:21:04.780
<v Speaker 1>and then how long it takes to put them in a vegetative state permanently.</v>

683
00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:06.453
<v Speaker 1>You mastered that.</v>

684
00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:07.300
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

685
00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:08.410
<v Speaker 1>So like anybody,</v>

686
00:21:08.411 --> 00:21:12.040
<v Speaker 1>like you're like a vigilante and anybody who deserves to be a vegetable,</v>

687
00:21:12.041 --> 00:21:12.790
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to kill him.</v>

688
00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:13.870
<v Speaker 1>Child molesters.</v>

689
00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:15.230
<v Speaker 1>And you hope you have a timer,</v>

690
00:21:15.231 --> 00:21:16.390

<v Speaker 1>you let them go in their vegetable.</v>

692
00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:18.761
<v Speaker 1>If you didn't kill him,</v>

693
00:21:18.761 --> 00:21:20.050
<v Speaker 1>that's genius to kill him.</v>

694
00:21:20.051 --> 00:21:20.884
<v Speaker 1>But they're like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I've been talking Shit to count about his taekwondo days for years now.</v>

732
00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:23.370
<v Speaker 1>His wife has proof,</v>

733
00:22:23.371 --> 00:22:24.120
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>

734
00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:25.490
<v Speaker 1>of what look at the past.</v>

735
00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:27.840
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

736
00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:29.010
<v Speaker 1>there are pictures of me.</v>

737
00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:29.550
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

738
00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:32.460
<v Speaker 1>she has pictures of them probably flying through the air.</v>

739
00:22:32.461 --> 00:22:33.210
<v Speaker 1>Killing a cow.</v>

740
00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:34.140
<v Speaker 1>That's nothing to be proud of.</v>

741
00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:37.430
<v Speaker 1>If you have a shiny Sol,</v>

742
00:22:37.431 --> 00:22:38.940
<v Speaker 1>like that's terrible.</v>

743
00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:41.670
<v Speaker 1>You got to pick your knee up.</v>

744
00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:42.970
<v Speaker 1>You have a,</v>

745
00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:43.380
<v Speaker 1>nope.</v>

746
00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:43.980
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

747
00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:45.390
<v Speaker 1>it's not bad,</v>

748
00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:48.990
<v Speaker 1>but you have an inherent flaw in your technique that probably was never,</v>

749
00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:52.130
<v Speaker 1>never explained to you for 49 no,</v>

750
00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:52.973
<v Speaker 1>it ain't bad.</v>

751
00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:54.620
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty good.</v>

752
00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:55.453
<v Speaker 1>It's just not right.</v>

753
00:22:56.090 --> 00:22:57.390
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't want to get hit by that.</v>

754
00:22:57.900 --> 00:22:59.850
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't want to get hit by hitting them.</v>

755
00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:02.010
<v Speaker 1>Riding a shaft.</v>

756
00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:02.970
<v Speaker 1>That's where you would get hit.</v>

757
00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:03.871
<v Speaker 1>What did you,</v>

758
00:23:03.871 --> 00:23:04.920
<v Speaker 1>did you really get a black belt?</v>

759
00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:05.970
<v Speaker 1>I was a master.</v>

760
00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:07.323
<v Speaker 1>Come on,</v>

761
00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:08.343
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>

762
00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:11.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what he's really good about his rank master.</v>

763
00:23:11.521 --> 00:23:12.354
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

764
00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:13.863
<v Speaker 1>Let me back.</v>

765
00:23:13.890 --> 00:23:14.723
<v Speaker 1>I went back to the,</v>

766
00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:16.133
<v Speaker 1>how long did you train?</v>

767
00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:18.660
<v Speaker 1>Probably seven years straight.</v>

768
00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:20.040
<v Speaker 1>Seven years straight.</v>

769
00:23:20.041 --> 00:23:20.874
<v Speaker 1>And where were you living?</v>

770
00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:22.921
<v Speaker 1>All through college.</v>

771
00:23:22.921 --> 00:23:23.754
<v Speaker 1>All through college.</v>

772
00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:27.150
<v Speaker 1>You must have been training when I met you then and then three years after it by</v>

773
00:23:27.151 --> 00:23:27.480
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

774
00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:28.590
<v Speaker 1>just stop and I wasn't,</v>

775
00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:31.020
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't sparring that I'd probably stop just then.</v>

776
00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:33.510
<v Speaker 1>So when did you get her black belt?</v>

777
00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:34.380
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
