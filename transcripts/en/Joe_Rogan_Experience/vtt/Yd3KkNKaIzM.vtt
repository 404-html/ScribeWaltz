<v Speaker 1>Clay,</v>

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:06.240
<v Speaker 1>Joey telling shit stories for sure.</v>

3
00:00:06.241 --> 00:00:07.980
<v Speaker 1>And he told us about when he shit,</v>

4
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:08.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5
00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.190
<v Speaker 1>in his backyard and somebody thought it was a bear.</v>

6
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.930
<v Speaker 1>She will let her dogs out every day until</v>

7
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.650
<v Speaker 1>I took a shit and I put my back against the wall.</v>

8
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.360
<v Speaker 1>When you shit outside,</v>

9
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.070
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to be a decent shit.</v>

10
00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:30.720
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be like explosive.</v>

11
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:32.470
<v Speaker 1>So when I got up,</v>

12
00:00:32.471 --> 00:00:33.930
<v Speaker 1>but it looks like somebody got shot in the head,</v>

13
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.401
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

14
00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:35.490
<v Speaker 1>we shut off behind me.</v>

15
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.640
<v Speaker 1>So she's sitting there with French poodles,</v>

16
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.990
<v Speaker 1>Chihuahuas and she's looking at the wall like what the fuck happened?</v>

17
00:00:42.991 --> 00:00:47.991
<v Speaker 1>Then all of a sudden she actually walks up close to it squints and looks and</v>

18
00:00:49.141 --> 00:00:50.880
<v Speaker 1>looks around and runs in the house.</v>

19
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm watching all this,</v>

20
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.273
<v Speaker 1>I can't breathe.</v>

21
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.640
<v Speaker 1>And now I go into the computer cause my wife's very decent.</v>

22
00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm sitting there for half and then my wife comes in,</v>

23
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:00.931
<v Speaker 1>she goes,</v>

24
00:01:00.931 --> 00:01:02.160
<v Speaker 1>where are you home all day today?</v>

25
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.511
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

26
00:01:03.511 --> 00:01:03.781
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

00:01:03.781 --> 00:01:04.010
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

28
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:04.240
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>

29
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.940
<v Speaker 1>I just had a conversation with Susan.</v>

30
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.370
<v Speaker 1>She wanted to know if you heard anything in the backyard.</v>

31
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.310
<v Speaker 1>I want to get Sushi,</v>

32
00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.130
<v Speaker 1>but give it a go get Sushi.</v>

33
00:01:19.131 --> 00:01:19.964
<v Speaker 1>I eat a lot of it.</v>

34
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:21.690
<v Speaker 1>The rice pushes everything.</v>

35
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.980
<v Speaker 1>I had plans to go get it.</v>

36
00:01:23.981 --> 00:01:24.661
<v Speaker 1>A weed store.</v>

37
00:01:24.661 --> 00:01:25.740
<v Speaker 1>You want to go to post office.</v>

38
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.120
<v Speaker 1>But I made a detour.</v>

39
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.050
<v Speaker 1>I plan to go home,</v>

40
00:01:28.051 --> 00:01:31.590
<v Speaker 1>but I left the house key in the house so I had to climb around the window.</v>

41
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:32.281
<v Speaker 1>That's what happened.</v>

42
00:01:32.281 --> 00:01:32.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

43
00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

44
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.230
<v Speaker 1>When I pulled myself up,</v>

45
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.830
<v Speaker 1>I actually landed with my stomach on the window and that you really made it push</v>

46
00:01:40.291 --> 00:01:41.150

47
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.270
<v Speaker 1>and I sign it and fuck and my hands are struggling in the window</v>

48
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.340
<v Speaker 1>and the cat's scratching at me.</v>

49
00:01:50.341 --> 00:01:50.850
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
