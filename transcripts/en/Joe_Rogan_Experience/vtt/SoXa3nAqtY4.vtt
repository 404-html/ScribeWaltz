<v Speaker 1>like a wallet phone.</v>

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.130
<v Speaker 1>While it's a good word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that funny?</v>

11
00:00:29.131 --> 00:00:30.450
<v Speaker 1>Like there's words you're allowed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>use.</v>

12
00:00:30.451 --> 00:00:32.430

00:00:32.431 --> 00:00:34.670
<v Speaker 1>a backpack and no one says anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

16
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.250
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no problem with that.</v>

17
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.180
<v Speaker 1>But if you have some sort of a Satchel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

18
00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.170
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very suspect,</v>

19
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.040
<v Speaker 1>very suspect.</v>

20
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.220
<v Speaker 1>Open yourself up for a lot of verbal</v>
<v Speaker 1>attacks,</v>

21
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying and it's like this style of</v>

22
00:00:51.061 --> 00:00:55.740
<v Speaker 1>satchels important too because if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>got like a Satchel that's like in any</v>

23
00:00:55.741 --> 00:00:58.920
<v Speaker 1>way stylish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can't just be wearing like</v>

24
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.900
<v Speaker 1>converse all stars and a tee shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to wear like hipster clothes,</v>

25
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.960
<v Speaker 1>you have to come like rolled up cuffs</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you have to have like a nice tie up</v>

26
00:01:06.961 --> 00:01:08.670
<v Speaker 1>leather shoe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

27
00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.780
<v Speaker 1>like you have to go there having mcinnis</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gavin mcinnes you know,</v>

28
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.420
<v Speaker 1>you gotta you gotta figure out what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to wear with it?</v>

29
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta you gotta look the part.</v>

30
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.380
<v Speaker 1>So that's why I still take a lot of heat</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the fanny pack.</v>

31
00:01:22.381 --> 00:01:23.590
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's funny cause I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

32
00:01:23.591 --> 00:01:24.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the thing all the time.</v>

33
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.570
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel uncomfortable when I wear it</v>

34
00:01:27.571 --> 00:01:29.540
<v Speaker 1>sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quite honestly like yeah,</v>

35
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.630
<v Speaker 1>wear it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've realized people are looking at</v>

36
00:01:31.631 --> 00:01:33.810
<v Speaker 1>it and they notice it and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>mocking me.</v>

37
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't have the balls to wear a fanny</v>
<v Speaker 1>pack.</v>

38
00:01:37.201 --> 00:01:39.060
<v Speaker 1>I got to tell you that right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wear it on stage.</v>

39
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.340
<v Speaker 1>You wear it on stage award onstage a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of times,</v>

40
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.460
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to pull anything out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>there because I don't want to leave my</v>

41
00:01:44.461 --> 00:01:47.090
<v Speaker 1>wallet in the greenroom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shady people working on the comedy club.</v>

42
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.590
<v Speaker 1>I'd Robert him steal my wallet</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that's how like much I'm into</v>

43
00:01:56.311 --> 00:01:58.740
<v Speaker 1>like looking off looking like a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

44
00:01:58.741 --> 00:02:01.110
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't do it.</v>

45
00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.850
<v Speaker 1>You just call this a purse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You may never see this again as I call</v>

46
00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:05.693
<v Speaker 1>it a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might,</v>

47
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.120
<v Speaker 1>I might throw the phone away with it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>just get a new phone.</v>

48
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.490
<v Speaker 1>You have to have a cover though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found that out man.</v>

49
00:02:11.491 --> 00:02:14.780
<v Speaker 1>I tried to go natural with my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my last phone and uh,</v>

50
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.040
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dropped it a few times and it was</v>

51
00:02:17.041 --> 00:02:18.900
<v Speaker 1>toast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's shattered.</v>

52
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.000
<v Speaker 1>Jamie's going natural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't drop it.</v>

53
00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.410
<v Speaker 1>Pretty careful with in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's still good to go.</v>

54
00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.390
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I dropped this one now</v>

55
00:02:27.391 --> 00:02:28.850
<v Speaker 1>that I have a case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's funny.</v>

56
00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:29.671
<v Speaker 1>The funny thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

57
00:02:29.671 --> 00:02:30.600
<v Speaker 1>that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

58
00:02:30.601 --> 00:02:33.110
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't have a case like bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I dropped back here.</v>

59
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you go,</v>

60
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.150
<v Speaker 1>I've been raw like no case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just raw,</v>

61
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.890
<v Speaker 1>no condom on the phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be careful with that shit.</v>

62
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.130
<v Speaker 1>Feels good that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it?</v>

63
00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.590
<v Speaker 1>That way I have the natural phone in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your hand with nothing on it.</v>

64
00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.910
<v Speaker 1>It also feels like you're a risk taker.</v>

65
00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm a mother fucker and he's got no</v>
<v Speaker 1>cooper.</v>

66
00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.470
<v Speaker 1>My phone pitch right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't it feel kind of more modern</v>

67
00:03:02.471 --> 00:03:03.880
<v Speaker 1>times?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a risk.</v>

68
00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.050
<v Speaker 1>That's 2016 it is a risk to not have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>case on your fucking phone.</v>

69
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.960
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're rebel were rebelling.</v>

70
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the softest time to be alive.</v>

71
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.360
<v Speaker 1>It's so easy to be alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

72
00:03:19.361 --> 00:03:23.530
<v Speaker 1>we're trying to eradicate all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous parts that are left.</v>

73
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.100
<v Speaker 1>Like there's the dead dangerous parts</v>
<v Speaker 1>are left like particularly in America.</v>

74
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.790
<v Speaker 1>There's so highlighted now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the reasons why I think like</v>

75
00:03:30.791 --> 00:03:34.840
<v Speaker 1>Chicago and Baltimore and Detroit and</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we find out like the murder</v>

76
00:03:34.841 --> 00:03:37.780
<v Speaker 1>statistics for all these cities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that freaks us out is</v>

77
00:03:37.781 --> 00:03:41.050
<v Speaker 1>that for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of this country is,</v>

78
00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.800
<v Speaker 1>is easy going and soft as its ever been</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>

79
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.060
<v Speaker 1>So when you see some crazy violence like</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a youtube video or Worldstar hip hop</v>

80
00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:50.890
<v Speaker 1>or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>live leak.</v>

81
00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.050
<v Speaker 1>I watch some live leak shit the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>day I got to stop doing that.</v>

82
00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.730
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to stop traumatizing and they'll</v>

83
00:03:57.731 --> 00:04:01.180
<v Speaker 1>get you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you realize like there are still</v>

84
00:04:01.181 --> 00:04:05.440
<v Speaker 1>spots where it's dangerous as fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for the most part it's so soft.</v>

85
00:04:05.441 --> 00:04:09.310
<v Speaker 1>Right now it's so soft.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right now we're risk takers if we have</v>

86
00:04:09.311 --> 00:04:11.410
<v Speaker 1>no phone cover,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's us.</v>

87
00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:12.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the new tattoo.</v>

88
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I have no phone cover.</v>

89
00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.230
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's tattooed now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To me that's weird.</v>

90
00:04:17.231 --> 00:04:19.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously I have them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I just,</v>

91
00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:22.180
<v Speaker 1>it's odd for me to see how many more</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have tattoos today.</v>

92
00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.520
<v Speaker 1>How long have you had your tactics?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Awhile.</v>

93
00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:29.260
<v Speaker 1>While I had one on my shoulder forever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got one when I think I was like 23 or</v>

94
00:04:30.461 --> 00:04:33.220
<v Speaker 1>four or something like that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>rebellious back then.</v>

95
00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.691
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

96
00:04:34.691 --> 00:04:37.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm going crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was something I drew two and my</v>

97
00:04:37.301 --> 00:04:38.710
<v Speaker 1>friend Tommy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

98
00:04:38.711 --> 00:04:41.560
<v Speaker 1>my friend Tommy Jr had gone to this guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>already,</v>

99
00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.220

<v Speaker 1>Danny Williams in Connecticut and he was</v>

100
00:04:45.221 --> 00:04:46.330
<v Speaker 1>really good artists.</v>

101

<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

103
00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.290
<v Speaker 1>it's just the trust that would your</v>
<v Speaker 1>tattoos back then it was a wicked</v>

104
00:04:53.291 --> 00:04:54.430
<v Speaker 1>artists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

105
00:04:54.431 --> 00:04:59.170

<v Speaker 1>it's like back then tattoos as an art</v>

106
00:04:59.171 --> 00:05:02.920
<v Speaker 1>form was way more obscure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like now I think people know like Kat</v>

107

108
00:05:06.131 --> 00:05:09.430

109
00:05:09.431 --> 00:05:11.590
<v Speaker 1>clothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like ed hardy was like a world famous</v>

<v Speaker 1>which is I think important.</v>

120
00:05:41.051 --> 00:05:43.120
<v Speaker 1>If you want to have someone draw on you</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the rest of your life.</v>

121
00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.290

<v Speaker 1>Like they have the like the hair dress</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know conversations when you're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>there to get the tats.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you'll get to have like these deep</v>

126
00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.150
<v Speaker 1>conversations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Erin and I,</v>

127
00:05:59.151 --> 00:06:04.151
<v Speaker 1>we talked for like 45 hours on my right</v>
<v Speaker 1>arm and like probably like 60 hours on</v>

128
00:06:06.021 --> 00:06:08.870
<v Speaker 1>my left arm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of this talk as a lot of</v>

129
00:06:08.871 --> 00:06:11.780
<v Speaker 1>talking and sometimes you don't really</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk though cause sometimes he's just</v>

130
00:06:11.781 --> 00:06:16.781
<v Speaker 1>deep into it and I'm just like watch a</v>
<v Speaker 1>like like a watch I was watching.</v>

131
00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:20.760
<v Speaker 1>That's my watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like most of a breaking bad season one,</v>

132
00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:21.850
<v Speaker 1>season two as well as shit.</v>

133
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.890
<v Speaker 1>That's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like the perfect show to watch it</v>

134
00:06:24.891 --> 00:06:28.460
<v Speaker 1>be getting a tattoo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's good mood music.</v>

135
00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:31.740
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watching breaking bad and getting a</v>

136
00:06:31.741 --> 00:06:34.460
<v Speaker 1>tattoo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like the pain of the Tattoo</v>

137
00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.300
<v Speaker 1>accentuates the show because the show is</v>
<v Speaker 1>so chaotic and fucked up.</v>

138
00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:43.040
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like better while someone's</v>
<v Speaker 1>drilling on your elbow and the tattoo</v>

139
00:06:43.041 --> 00:06:45.440
<v Speaker 1>needle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You said elbow and needle.</v>

140
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:48.040
<v Speaker 1>I felt that he feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

141
00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:49.370
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a rough spot.</v>

142
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.580
<v Speaker 1>The inside of the oboe wreck right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a really rough spot.</v>

143
00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:55.850
<v Speaker 1>What's interesting is that the closer it</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets to your chest,</v>

144
00:06:55.851 --> 00:06:58.130
<v Speaker 1>it's a really rough spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're like woo.</v>

145
00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:01.760
<v Speaker 1>Different spots of different level of</v>
<v Speaker 1>pain.</v>

146
00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:03.410
<v Speaker 1>They experience trauma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very strange.</v>

147
00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:05.570
<v Speaker 1>Like your shoulder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>

148
00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:08.330
<v Speaker 1>He could draw me all day on my shoulder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fall asleep.</v>

149
00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:10.220
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm not kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

150
00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:12.470
<v Speaker 1>Like the shoulder just doesn't seem to</v>
<v Speaker 1>hurt.</v>

151
00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:16.340
<v Speaker 1>But you get down to like some air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The inside of the arm.</v>

152
00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:19.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a different feeling.</v>

153
00:07:19.851 --> 00:07:20.684
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

154
00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:24.680
<v Speaker 1>I guess the nerves are closer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like anywhere that's got more meat on it</v>

155
00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:27.690
<v Speaker 1>is like protected more from the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

156
00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:31.370
<v Speaker 1>It's funny though cause it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're finding out shit about</v>

157
00:07:31.371 --> 00:07:32.720
<v Speaker 1>your body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

158
00:07:32.721 --> 00:07:35.060
<v Speaker 1>while you're getting tattooed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know it's like,</v>

159
00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:40.610
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of like sometimes you are</v>
<v Speaker 1>having sex with a girl and I always</v>

160
00:07:40.611 --> 00:07:41.411
<v Speaker 1>liked when she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

161
00:07:41.411 --> 00:07:44.960
<v Speaker 1>I never felt that before like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's ever touched that part or</v>

162
00:07:44.961 --> 00:07:49.370
<v Speaker 1>explored that part and it's like you</v>
<v Speaker 1>find it anywhere you digging Ian and</v>

163
00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:55.570
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where am I not good?</v>

164
00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:58.980
<v Speaker 1>If you love a you just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will try to find it.</v>

165
00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:04.240
<v Speaker 1>Of course when the girl says like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the good percentage of me always goes,</v>

166
00:08:04.311 --> 00:08:05.170
<v Speaker 1>y'all right.</v>

167
00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:10.800
<v Speaker 1>Ah Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

168
00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:15.620
<v Speaker 1>Every time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time in my life a girl said</v>

169
00:08:15.621 --> 00:08:16.840
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Always be like,</v>

170
00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.640
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it seems like something that</v>

171
00:08:19.641 --> 00:08:21.470
<v Speaker 1>girls think that guys want to hear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dot.</v>

172
00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:23.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a part of faking it.</v>

173
00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:27.770
<v Speaker 1>Well it's a part of getting the guy to</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you like getting a girl to like,</v>

174
00:08:27.771 --> 00:08:31.520

<v Speaker 1>artificial shit.</v>

175
00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:35.480
<v Speaker 1>Pretend to be a certain way per hen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretend to behave a certain way,</v>

176
00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:38.720
<v Speaker 1>but when it gets down to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

177
00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:41.390
<v Speaker 1>you get to know them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes,</v>

178
00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:44.540
<v Speaker 1>takes a long time to chip away from that</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

179
00:08:44.541 --> 00:08:47.120
<v Speaker 1>So when someone says something that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Cliche,</v>

<v Speaker 1>had one of those and then you switched</v>

205
00:09:39.451 --> 00:09:40.081
<v Speaker 1>it back out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

206
00:09:40.081 --> 00:09:43.620
<v Speaker 1>Now I have a galaxy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have an iphone.</v>

207
00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:44.610
<v Speaker 1>I have two different phones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

00:09:44.611 --> 00:09:47.130
<v Speaker 1>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you got to go to the mess.</v>

209
00:09:47.131 --> 00:09:50.910
<v Speaker 1>That note that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think that the ability to draw on</v>

210
00:09:50.911 --> 00:09:52.230
<v Speaker 1>the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like God is going to come into</v>

211
00:09:52.231 --> 00:09:53.064
<v Speaker 1>play someday.</v>

212
00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:54.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to make some funny shit with</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

213
00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:56.940
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have your friends and,</v>

214
00:09:56.941 --> 00:09:59.310
<v Speaker 1>but it seems like those are meme</v>
<v Speaker 1>generators.</v>

215
00:09:59.311 --> 00:10:02.860
<v Speaker 1>We just go and get like a little thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>and put the text into it.</v>

216
00:10:02.861 --> 00:10:05.160
<v Speaker 1>That seems like that's easier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's easier.</v>

217
00:10:05.161 --> 00:10:08.010
<v Speaker 1>But sometimes it's a pain in the ass</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes to move it to where you want</v>

218
00:10:08.011 --> 00:10:09.180
<v Speaker 1>to move it to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My Shit.</v>

219
00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:11.760
<v Speaker 1>Like the reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the reasons I like having this is</v>

220
00:10:11.761 --> 00:10:14.340
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there was like last year I wasn't,</v>

<v Speaker 1>and I was living at a friend's house so</v>

223

<v Speaker 1>yourself with this.</v>

227
00:10:30.721 --> 00:10:32.700

<v Speaker 1>phone.</v>

228
00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:35.640
<v Speaker 1>You could sign it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could like read the contract and</v>

229
00:10:35.641 --> 00:10:40.590
<v Speaker 1>then sign it and send it in via email</v>
<v Speaker 1>back without printing anything out or</v>

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:45.470
<v Speaker 1>that's a big thing to have in that case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But how weird is that?</v>

232
00:10:45.471 --> 00:10:48.630
<v Speaker 1>We're still signing things like how much</v>
<v Speaker 1>longer is that going to,</v>

233
00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:50.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about it,</v>

234
00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:53.220
<v Speaker 1>a unique movement with your hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

235
00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:57.140
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all know that I used to replicate all</v>

236
00:10:57.141 --> 00:11:01.110
<v Speaker 1>the kiss signatures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every kid knows how to do that,</v>

237
00:11:01.111 --> 00:11:03.030
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael Jordan's autograph.</v>

238
00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:06.270
<v Speaker 1>Oh sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well probably a bunch of people who have</v>

239
00:11:06.271 --> 00:11:07.730
<v Speaker 1>fake memorabilia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

240
00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:11.910
<v Speaker 1>Like with a guy like Michael Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a basketball signed by Michael</v>

241
00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:15.150
<v Speaker 1>Jordan is worth how much more than a</v>
<v Speaker 1>regular basketball and a fake</v>

242
00:11:15.151 --> 00:11:16.400
<v Speaker 1>basketball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not cyber.</v>

243
00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:20.890
<v Speaker 1>My coach is worth still a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

244
00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:21.930
<v Speaker 1>Well how about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

245
00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:23.850
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't even have to be a real</v>
<v Speaker 1>basketball.</v>

246
00:11:23.851 --> 00:11:26.280
<v Speaker 1>It would be a child's toy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael Jordan signs.</v>

247
00:11:26.281 --> 00:11:27.870
<v Speaker 1>It's worth a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it,</v>

248
00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:30.450
<v Speaker 1>it only makes sense that a unique hand</v>
<v Speaker 1>movement,</v>

249
00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:33.840
<v Speaker 1>it can be easily replicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like what he could do on the</v>

250
00:11:33.841 --> 00:11:35.890
<v Speaker 1>basketball court.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could do with his handwriting.</v>

251
00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:38.310
<v Speaker 1>Is that hilarious?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody can fuck with his hand.</v>

252
00:11:38.311 --> 00:11:41.120
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't nobody get malaria.</v>

253
00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:44.100
<v Speaker 1>Fuck slams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gunk from center court like he did.</v>

254
00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:45.151
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody,</v>

255
00:11:45.151 --> 00:11:46.470
<v Speaker 1>you can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't do it.</v>

256
00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:50.810
<v Speaker 1>But the motherfucker rights just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

257
00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:53.980
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have some crazy writing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody</v>

258
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:55.080
<v Speaker 2>can replicate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

259
00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:58.210
<v Speaker 2>He just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just writes his name.</v>

260
00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:01.870
<v Speaker 2>So all you have to do is look at that</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing and then recreate it.</v>

261
00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:03.940
<v Speaker 2>Like I was watching this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

262
00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:08.710
<v Speaker 2>a documentary on art forgery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fascinating shows,</v>

263
00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:12.400
<v Speaker 2>fascinating shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which one I wish I could remember,</v>

264
00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:15.310
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I caught it on television and I</v>

265
00:12:15.311 --> 00:12:17.470
<v Speaker 2>caught it when it was already started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

266
00:12:17.471 --> 00:12:19.120
<v Speaker 2>just flipping through the channels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what is this?</v>

267
00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:22.540
<v Speaker 2>And I don't remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what I do remember was that,</v>

268
00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:24.550
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was an article that I had read as</v>

269
00:12:24.551 --> 00:12:29.020
<v Speaker 2>well about this one guy who was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>forgery guy,</v>

270
00:12:29.021 --> 00:12:33.640
<v Speaker 2>but in a weird way when he would do is</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would make a fake version,</v>

271
00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:37.510
<v Speaker 2>a new piece of art,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but from that artist's style,</v>

272
00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:42.720
<v Speaker 2>and this guy apparently was making</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking millions of dollars in Europe</v>

273
00:12:42.881 --> 00:12:43.481
<v Speaker 2>with this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

274
00:12:43.481 --> 00:12:46.960
<v Speaker 2>people would go crazy after the war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>during the war or something like that.</v>

275
00:12:46.961 --> 00:12:48.520
<v Speaker 2>I wish I remembered that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

276
00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:49.480
<v Speaker 2>do you know it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

277
00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:50.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure this is it.</v>

278
00:12:50.681 --> 00:12:52.420
<v Speaker 3>It's on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure it's on Netflix or it</v>

279
00:12:52.421 --> 00:12:53.171
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

280
00:12:53.171 --> 00:12:55.690
<v Speaker 3>That's the guy truckee the artist</v>
<v Speaker 3>forgeries what it is.</v>

281
00:12:55.691 --> 00:12:56.441
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

282
00:12:56.441 --> 00:12:58.630
<v Speaker 3>There we really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his story's really cool how he does it.</v>

283
00:12:58.631 --> 00:12:59.464
<v Speaker 3>You can probably explain it.</v>

284
00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:00.211
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>

285
00:13:00.211 --> 00:13:05.211
<v Speaker 2>It's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would study the art of each guy or</v>

286
00:13:06.001 --> 00:13:08.100
<v Speaker 2>woman or whoever he was trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>replicate,</v>

287
00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:13.460
<v Speaker 2>and then he would create a new fake</v>
<v Speaker 2>piece that they did that was so good</v>

288
00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:19.680
<v Speaker 2>that experts couldn't understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Experts were,</v>

289
00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:20.990
<v Speaker 2>they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

290
00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:23.580
<v Speaker 2>this is a picasso.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I know because I've seen,</v>

291
00:13:23.581 --> 00:13:25.620
<v Speaker 2>because I study because this is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>picasso.</v>

292
00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:29.010
<v Speaker 2>That's how good he was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think what fucked him up was he</v>

293
00:13:29.011 --> 00:13:34.011
<v Speaker 2>got cocky and he used a color of paint</v>
<v Speaker 2>that wasn't available back then.</v>

294
00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:38.970
<v Speaker 2>And it was almost like summit speculated</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he did it like you wanted to see if</v>

295
00:13:38.971 --> 00:13:42.450
<v Speaker 2>he could get caught.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's almost like he wanted to take</v>

296
00:13:42.451 --> 00:13:45.220
<v Speaker 2>credit for his work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Serial killer.</v>

297
00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:46.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

298
00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:48.570
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

299
00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:50.460
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was how it happened.</v>

300
00:13:50.461 --> 00:13:51.294
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

301
00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:53.950
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause I was really confused as I was</v>

302
00:13:53.951 --> 00:13:56.260
<v Speaker 3>watching it because he and his wife both</v>
<v Speaker 3>got,</v>

303
00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:59.140
<v Speaker 3>they were both arrested in both were</v>
<v Speaker 3>serving prison sentences,</v>

304
00:13:59.141 --> 00:14:02.110
<v Speaker 3>but they were allowed out during the day</v>
<v Speaker 3>to go work to draw.</v>

305
00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:04.510
<v Speaker 3>But it had to be separated for some and</v>
<v Speaker 3>some part.</v>

306
00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:07.120
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he was working now selling art</v>

307
00:14:07.121 --> 00:14:10.090
<v Speaker 3>of his own because he was so good and</v>
<v Speaker 3>people knew how good his forgeries,</v>

308
00:14:10.091 --> 00:14:13.330
<v Speaker 3>where some people actually wanted those</v>
<v Speaker 3>forgeries because they were so good.</v>

309
00:14:13.331 --> 00:14:14.310
<v Speaker 3>So now he's got to name them.</v>

310
00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:16.350
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And wait for somebody forges his shit.</v>

311
00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:20.600
<v Speaker 2>Well he doesn't have a style.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like a hack exact community.</v>

312
00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:24.180
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But obviously super talented.</v>

313
00:14:24.181 --> 00:14:27.480
<v Speaker 2>What a bittersweet thing though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you got to think that a guy that</v>

314
00:14:27.481 --> 00:14:30.270
<v Speaker 2>can be that talented,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that can replicate that,</v>

315
00:14:30.271 --> 00:14:31.770
<v Speaker 2>that is art,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

316
00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:32.910
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause he's,</v>

317
00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:34.800
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's doing new pieces,</v>

318
00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:37.110
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>New Pieces in their style.</v>

319
00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:41.910
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] which in a way is kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>more honorable of form of forgery.</v>

320
00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:45.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you're going to go down the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucker food chain,</v>

321
00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:50.870
<v Speaker 2>like to recreate a piece of art is</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably more honorable or to</v>

322
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:54.110
<v Speaker 1>create your own version of this person's</v>
<v Speaker 1>arts.</v>

323
00:14:54.111 --> 00:14:57.470
<v Speaker 1>Parvin more honorable than like if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>had a painting and I had made an exact</v>

324
00:14:57.471 --> 00:14:58.304
<v Speaker 1>duplicate of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

325
00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:03.690
<v Speaker 4>Well when you first started the story,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like fuck rich people for being so</v>

326
00:15:03.691 --> 00:15:05.930
<v Speaker 4>much into art.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They deserve to get screwed by this</v>

327
00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:08.760
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then when you said he's a hack,</v>

328
00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:12.810
<v Speaker 4>then I related to it on a comedy level</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I was like fuck this guy.</v>

329
00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:18.540
<v Speaker 4>Cause I feel the pain of following hacks</v>
<v Speaker 4>who are ripping,</v>

330
00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:23.100
<v Speaker 4>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or or getting accolades and the</v>

331
00:15:23.101 --> 00:15:26.910
<v Speaker 4>audiences don't know that they are hack.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh that's the sort of story I can relate</v>

332
00:15:26.911 --> 00:15:29.130
<v Speaker 4>to it on on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on different levels.</v>

333
00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:32.390
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that terrible feeling when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>walk in a room and someone's killing</v>

334
00:15:32.391 --> 00:15:37.391
<v Speaker 1>with some like really bullshit material.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you know for sure this is just chop</v>

335
00:15:37.791 --> 00:15:38.690
<v Speaker 1>chop material.</v>

336
00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:40.700
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It makes me more angry at the audience</v>

337
00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:42.830
<v Speaker 4>then the person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause I've already been angry at this</v>

338
00:15:42.831 --> 00:15:44.240
<v Speaker 4>person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've already seen him before and knowing</v>

339
00:15:44.241 --> 00:15:45.240
<v Speaker 4>them before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most likely.</v>

340
00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:50.410
<v Speaker 4>But then I was like I have to try to do</v>
<v Speaker 4>my shit in front of this audience that</v>

341
00:15:50.451 --> 00:15:52.730
<v Speaker 4>doesn't know that this is fake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a fake y'all.</v>

342
00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:54.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched somebody still on a Freddy,</v>

343
00:15:54.881 --> 00:15:56.090
<v Speaker 1>so those bits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other guy,</v>

344
00:15:56.170 --> 00:15:58.090
<v Speaker 1>oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I had to leave the room.</v>

345
00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:00.250
<v Speaker 1>Audience was laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't leave the room.</v>

346
00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:02.100
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

347
00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:03.790
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't even see this.</v>

348
00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:05.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

349
00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:08.020
<v Speaker 1>especially a guy like Freddy who was</v>
<v Speaker 1>dead,</v>

350
00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:10.840
<v Speaker 1>who was awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the best guys ever.</v>

351
00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:12.100
<v Speaker 1>Just such a sweetie.</v>

352
00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:14.920
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to get over stuff like that</v>

353
00:16:14.921 --> 00:16:16.480
<v Speaker 4>though and not let it affect me.</v>

354
00:16:17.050 --> 00:16:18.360
<v Speaker 1>Just get away from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

355
00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:20.100
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about that last night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

356
00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:22.570
<v Speaker 1>Tony Hinchcliffe and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause he was talking about,</v>

357
00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:27.010
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that get to a certain point in</v>

358
00:16:27.011 --> 00:16:29.110
<v Speaker 1>their career and then they want it</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking things up.</v>

359
00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:32.640
<v Speaker 1>And Tony's like super ambitious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Tony's,</v>

360
00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:35.680
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's essentially making sure that none</v>

361
00:16:35.681 --> 00:16:39.080
<v Speaker 1>of this stuff ever happens to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's like seeing things that people</v>

362
00:16:39.081 --> 00:16:41.350
<v Speaker 1>are fucked up and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

363
00:16:41.351 --> 00:16:43.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dealing with people that hate on him</v>

364
00:16:43.241 --> 00:16:45.070
<v Speaker 1>because he's ambitious because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

365
00:16:45.071 --> 00:16:48.220
<v Speaker 1>he's always getting after it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but kids always writing,</v>

366
00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:50.710
<v Speaker 1>always doing new stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some people,</v>

367
00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:54.820
<v Speaker 1>they just get upset with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they think they feel like he is,</v>

368
00:16:54.821 --> 00:16:58.840
<v Speaker 1>his ambition is threatening to their</v>
<v Speaker 1>examination of themselves.</v>

369
00:16:58.841 --> 00:17:01.000
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

370
00:17:01.001 --> 00:17:02.770
<v Speaker 1>and up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were having a conversation about it</v>

371
00:17:02.771 --> 00:17:05.700
<v Speaker 1>last night and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't dwell on it just right.</v>

372
00:17:06.370 --> 00:17:07.600
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's easier said than done,</v>

373
00:17:07.601 --> 00:17:09.880
<v Speaker 1>but you see all these people out there</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are fuck it up.</v>

374
00:17:10.570 --> 00:17:13.510
<v Speaker 1>Don't pay attention to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just there's plenty of people around</v>

375
00:17:13.511 --> 00:17:15.640
<v Speaker 1>like bird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you like Joey,</v>

376
00:17:15.641 --> 00:17:18.310
<v Speaker 1>like Ari.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is plenty of people that are out</v>

377
00:17:18.311 --> 00:17:19.760
<v Speaker 1>there that are just killing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

378
00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:23.740
<v Speaker 1>Pay attention to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the best time ever for this</v>

379
00:17:23.741 --> 00:17:24.910
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

380
00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:27.670
<v Speaker 4>like my new thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

381
00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:32.150
<v Speaker 4>and I've done it in spurts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like just focus on the shit that I want,</v>

382
00:17:32.151 --> 00:17:34.220
<v Speaker 4>not the stuff that can stop me from</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting what I want.</v>

383
00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:38.600
<v Speaker 4>But I find like if you focus on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff that you want or where you want to</v>

384
00:17:38.601 --> 00:17:43.370
<v Speaker 4>get to and you have tunnel vision,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you'll be fine and you'll get</v>

385
00:17:43.371 --> 00:17:46.700
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like instead of creating all this</v>

386
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.070
<v Speaker 4>wasting time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>taking time away from your creativity,</v>

387
00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:54.750
<v Speaker 1>thinking about what people are thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about you and all that stuff and just</v>

388
00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:56.970
<v Speaker 1>focus on like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to make this joke work,</v>

389
00:17:56.971 --> 00:17:58.110
<v Speaker 1>this joke work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to do this.</v>

390
00:17:58.111 --> 00:18:00.120
<v Speaker 1>I need to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything that gets you that step</v>

391
00:18:00.121 --> 00:18:00.990
<v Speaker 1>further,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

392
00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:01.680
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

393
00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:04.870
<v Speaker 1>I think there's patterns of thought that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are really easy to fall into it.</v>

394
00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:07.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just seem natural and one of them</v>

395
00:18:07.201 --> 00:18:10.890
<v Speaker 1>is when there is something that's in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your way and you're trying to figure out</v>

396
00:18:10.891 --> 00:18:14.040
<v Speaker 1>why it's in your way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start concentrating on some of the</v>

397
00:18:14.041 --> 00:18:15.720
<v Speaker 1>aspects of it that are out of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>

398
00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:16.800
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you know,</v>

399
00:18:16.801 --> 00:18:20.130
<v Speaker 1>how come they don't like what I do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they like what she does or how come</v>

400
00:18:20.131 --> 00:18:22.320
<v Speaker 1>you know this has happened and how the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck did this guy get this?</v>

401
00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:27.740
<v Speaker 1>Instead of try to figure out how to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>so tuned into what you're doing that you</v>

402
00:18:30.511 --> 00:18:32.030
<v Speaker 1>don't concentrate on what they don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>

403
00:18:32.050 --> 00:18:34.170
<v Speaker 1>You just concentrate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

404
00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:35.790
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many times I cleaned my fucking</v>

405
00:18:35.791 --> 00:18:37.470
<v Speaker 1>brother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to stop drinking this butter</v>

406
00:18:37.471 --> 00:18:39.900
<v Speaker 1>coffee fucks up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Podcasts.</v>

407
00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:40.993
<v Speaker 1>It does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

408
00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:44.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm a little too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little too much,</v>

409
00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:47.430
<v Speaker 1>but it's hard to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's easy to say.</v>

410
00:18:47.431 --> 00:18:50.970
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to actually like get your mind</v>

411
00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:54.000
<v Speaker 1>into a place where you're concentrating</v>
<v Speaker 1>on only what you're trying to do,</v>

412
00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:56.730
<v Speaker 1>especially when the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the beginning of your career trying</v>

413
00:18:56.731 --> 00:19:00.060
<v Speaker 1>to get out there and getting booked and</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody wants to book you write</v>

414
00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:04.050
<v Speaker 1>some dude was bitching about that at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy store the other night.</v>

415
00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:07.090
<v Speaker 1>He was talking about how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

416
00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:08.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody's helping him out and all,</v>

417
00:19:08.941 --> 00:19:11.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these other people are doing well</v>

418
00:19:11.161 --> 00:19:11.994
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

419
00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:15.470
<v Speaker 1>it seems like it's bullshit and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>system is stacked against him.</v>

420
00:19:15.471 --> 00:19:16.590
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ,</v>

421
00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:18.660
<v Speaker 1>like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're dead.</v>

422
00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:19.550
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

423
00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:22.080
<v Speaker 1>it's so foolish because nobody knows who</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are.</v>

424
00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:23.910
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if nobody knows who you are,</v>

425
00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:24.631
<v Speaker 1>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

426
00:19:24.631 --> 00:19:26.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm plotting against you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't know yet.</v>

427
00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:31.170
<v Speaker 1>And this idea that this big grand</v>
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy,</v>

428
00:19:31.171 --> 00:19:34.500
<v Speaker 1>just because it's about fear and ego,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both of those Keller,</v>

429
00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:38.370
<v Speaker 1>but because these patterns and these</v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns that people go down to down</v>

430
00:19:38.371 --> 00:19:41.610
<v Speaker 1>through there just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they seem real normal.</v>

431
00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:44.100
<v Speaker 1>It seems normal to concentrate on stupid</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

432
00:19:44.101 --> 00:19:48.900
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like it's a distraction from</v>
<v Speaker 1>concentrating on the really important</v>

433
00:19:48.901 --> 00:19:51.240
<v Speaker 1>shit that's it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so comforting.</v>

434
00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:54.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying not to clear my throat them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck it.</v>

435
00:19:54.481 --> 00:19:56.260
<v Speaker 1>Just do it man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>

436
00:19:56.770 --> 00:19:59.490
<v Speaker 1>it's so comforting to go down those</v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid patterns.</v>

437
00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:02.370
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens when people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how people get obsessed about</v>

438
00:20:02.371 --> 00:20:03.810
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get obsessive,</v>

439
00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:06.490
<v Speaker 1>they start freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like their pattern.</v>

440
00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:08.190
<v Speaker 1>Creating your own distractions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

441
00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:11.610
<v Speaker 1>listen man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody can work harder to stop you.</v>

442
00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:15.540
<v Speaker 1>Then you want to work hard enough to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make it so just,</v>

443
00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:17.340
<v Speaker 1>just work hard and you'll be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're good.</v>

444
00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:20.010
<v Speaker 1>Nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's like taking that much time out</v>

445
00:20:20.011 --> 00:20:22.320
<v Speaker 1>of their life to stop you like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

446
00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:24.120
<v Speaker 1>Most of it is in your head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

447
00:20:24.121 --> 00:20:25.620
<v Speaker 1>Most of it's in our head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of it,</v>

448
00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:27.540
<v Speaker 1>and especially comics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I guess everybody,</v>

449
00:20:27.541 --> 00:20:32.090
<v Speaker 1>but like have had a good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has a comic.</v>

450
00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:33.930
<v Speaker 1>I've been in my head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all have,</v>

451
00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:37.290
<v Speaker 1>everybody has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know frank and Steve and I were</v>

452
00:20:37.291 --> 00:20:39.390
<v Speaker 1>talking about this last night at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy store bar.</v>

453
00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:44.780
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about the difference</v>
<v Speaker 1>between when you're learning how to do</v>

454
00:20:44.791 --> 00:20:48.000
<v Speaker 1>stand up and you kind of like wonder if</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is going</v>

455
00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.200
<v Speaker 2>to work again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this idea like,</v>

456
00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:51.700
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this going to work?</v>

457
00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:54.100
<v Speaker 2>Can I get this to work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do I get this to work?</v>

458
00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:58.690
<v Speaker 2>Which is still kind of do as you get</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a better at it or more experienced.</v>

459
00:20:58.691 --> 00:21:03.370
<v Speaker 2>But as you get older it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do I convey why I think this is</v>

460
00:21:03.371 --> 00:21:04.204
<v Speaker 2>funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

461
00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:09.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Before I had like no jokes.</v>

462
00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:11.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

463
00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:15.340
<v Speaker 2>But now I have like concepts of premises</v>
<v Speaker 2>that aren't funny and it's like,</v>

464
00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:17.080
<v Speaker 2>how do I make this funny?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

465
00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:19.160
<v Speaker 2>What do I think is funny about this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

466
00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:21.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do we get started on this?</v>

467
00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:24.700
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about something I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to diverge,</v>

468
00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:27.460
<v Speaker 2>but I forgot what did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what did we go from,</v>

469
00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:30.670
<v Speaker 2>we went from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to show the Tom [inaudible]</v>

470
00:21:30.671 --> 00:21:31.870
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should probably just show that.</v>

471
00:21:31.871 --> 00:21:34.960
<v Speaker 2>That's why I'm so distracted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This Thomas,</v>

472
00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:35.880
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me just explain it.</v>

473
00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:36.713
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we give it,</v>

474
00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:39.490
<v Speaker 2>let me get a little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

475
00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:44.050
<v Speaker 2>ended up Tom Segura,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our pal is killing it.</v>

476
00:21:44.051 --> 00:21:46.660
<v Speaker 2>And he's been on the road,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's selling out theaters is killing it</v>

477
00:21:46.661 --> 00:21:49.120
<v Speaker 2>all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that he asked to</v>

478
00:21:49.121 --> 00:21:53.920
<v Speaker 2>do unfortunately is sometimes he has to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do these morning shows.</v>

479
00:21:54.250 --> 00:21:58.120
<v Speaker 2>So if he's trying to sell tickets and</v>
<v Speaker 2>let everybody know that he's in town,</v>

480
00:21:58.330 --> 00:22:03.330
<v Speaker 2>he does morning radio and he'll do these</v>
<v Speaker 2>morning tv shows and when you talk about</v>

481
00:22:03.581 --> 00:22:07.870
<v Speaker 2>like levels of lameness for like</v>
<v Speaker 2>entertainment,</v>

482
00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:10.690
<v Speaker 2>like the morning shows are the most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

483
00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:14.350
<v Speaker 2>it's like people think milk is spicy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

484
00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:16.770
<v Speaker 2>they're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can you drink a whole milk,</v>

485
00:22:16.771 --> 00:22:19.810
<v Speaker 2>half done water my milk down and put</v>
<v Speaker 2>sugar in it.</v>

486
00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:22.960
<v Speaker 2>It's like the last remnants of Grandma</v>
<v Speaker 2>TV.</v>

487
00:22:22.961 --> 00:22:24.940
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here are the weirdest shows.</v>

488
00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:27.640
<v Speaker 2>They don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't bear any resemblance to</v>

489
00:22:27.641 --> 00:22:29.260
<v Speaker 2>anybody that I know that it's that age.</v>

490
00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:31.720
<v Speaker 2>When I see them talking to these young</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

<v Speaker 2>the Norman Rockwell days.</v>

497
00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:51.580
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like they colorize some old black</v>

<v Speaker 1>morning to do that shit.</v>

597
00:27:34.861 --> 00:27:36.960
<v Speaker 1>That shit is tiring and he's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

598
00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:38.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to figure out a way to do this</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

599
00:27:39.690 --> 00:27:42.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're brutal.</v>

600
00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:44.270
<v Speaker 1>Those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are the most brutal.</v>

601
00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:48.000
<v Speaker 1>What's also brutal because you know that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have to like figure out</v>

602
00:27:48.001 --> 00:27:50.580
<v Speaker 1>a way to be awake at eight o'clock for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the show.</v>

603
00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:52.710
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't be sleepy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

604
00:27:52.711 --> 00:27:54.390
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you only got like two or three hours</v>

605
00:27:54.391 --> 00:27:56.700
<v Speaker 1>sleep before he got up for this thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>because most of the time,</v>

606
00:27:56.790 --> 00:27:59.970
<v Speaker 1>most comics don't go to bed til like one</v>
<v Speaker 1>or two get up at six,</v>

607
00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:04.340
<v Speaker 1>do this radio thing bleary-eyed and most</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the time it's socks and yeah.</v>

608
00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:06.390
<v Speaker 1>And then you got to kind of be phony to</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes,</v>

609
00:28:06.391 --> 00:28:07.950
<v Speaker 1>cause you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like with a bunch of phony</v>

610
00:28:07.951 --> 00:28:11.070
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like this is a great way to not</v>

611
00:28:11.071 --> 00:28:13.830
<v Speaker 1>be phony and make fun of this phony</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>

612
00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:15.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Tom is,</v>

613
00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:16.960
<v Speaker 1>he's figured it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never figured it out.</v>

614
00:28:17.010 --> 00:28:18.150
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would just go and do them.</v>

615
00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:21.330
<v Speaker 1>Like that guy in the blue shirt full of</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

616
00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:23.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They suppose or at least the girl was</v>

617
00:28:23.491 --> 00:28:24.570
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't get it.</v>

618
00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:26.850
<v Speaker 1>And she nervously said it but she said</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

619
00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:28.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then she takes another thing she</v>

620
00:28:28.621 --> 00:28:33.621
<v Speaker 1>reacted to like the correct way but</v>
<v Speaker 1>still with a nice morning TV personality</v>

621
00:28:36.181 --> 00:28:38.170
<v Speaker 1>person way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at least she was like more honest.</v>

622
00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:42.260
<v Speaker 1>The guy was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's good to know them.</v>

623
00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:44.250
<v Speaker 1>What the thing that he doesn't even</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>

624
00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:46.950
<v Speaker 1>Well what he's doing is what they do.</v>

625
00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:51.390
<v Speaker 1>It's that way of talking that you know</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's a bunch of different fake</v>

626
00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:55.890
<v Speaker 1>ways of talking to people.</v>

<v Speaker 1>When you go home,</v>

654
00:30:07.151 --> 00:30:08.590
<v Speaker 1>you scream into a pillow case.</v>

655
00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:12.370
<v Speaker 6>Ah,</v>

656
00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:14.570
<v Speaker 1>what is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who wants to dress like Ryan's?</v>

657
00:30:14.571 --> 00:30:16.750
<v Speaker 1>He crest a lot of people in New York</v>
<v Speaker 1>magazine.</v>

658
00:30:16.751 --> 00:30:17.690
<v Speaker 1>What are you showing me here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he's,</v>

659
00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:22.360
<v Speaker 1>he's got a clover popular clothing line</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then of course it does quote.</v>

660
00:30:23.010 --> 00:30:25.990
<v Speaker 1>Did you hear about what happened with</v>
<v Speaker 1>all senior and or Sinead O'connor?</v>

661
00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:30.190
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody told me on the way up I saw</v>

662
00:30:30.191 --> 00:30:35.191
<v Speaker 1>like a photo of him like on a newsfeed</v>
<v Speaker 1>what she's accusing him of given Prince</v>

663
00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:43.030
<v Speaker 1>Percocet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>prince dying of an overdose.</v>

664
00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:47.470
<v Speaker 1>Sinead O'connor is accusing Arsenio Hall</v>
<v Speaker 1>of doing that.</v>

665
00:30:47.471 --> 00:30:50.290
<v Speaker 1>Why would she do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that true?</v>

666
00:30:51.130 --> 00:30:54.610
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just because you gave someone a fucking</v>

667
00:30:54.611 --> 00:30:57.040
<v Speaker 1>Percocet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of people take percosets and</v>

668
00:30:57.041 --> 00:30:59.320
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing wrong with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to be okay,</v>

669
00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:04.090
<v Speaker 1>but she called the feds and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll call the feds and you better get</v>

670
00:31:04.091 --> 00:31:05.740
<v Speaker 1>your house in order because they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming for you.</v>

671
00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:08.500
<v Speaker 1>Like she's basically blaming him for</v>
<v Speaker 1>prince's death.</v>

672
00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:10.870
<v Speaker 1>That's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

673
00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:15.960
<v Speaker 1>he had an addiction to pain pills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hall has denied the heinous accusations</v>

674
00:31:16.511 --> 00:31:19.390
<v Speaker 1>and lawsuit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Despicable fabricated lies.</v>

675
00:31:19.391 --> 00:31:22.810
<v Speaker 1>That's awful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's awful and a whole bunch of ways</v>

676
00:31:22.811 --> 00:31:25.930
<v Speaker 1>like it's awful that prince was addicted</v>
<v Speaker 1>to pills.</v>

677
00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:27.280
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't expect that.</v>

678
00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:29.500
<v Speaker 1>I guess he was addicted to pills because</v>
<v Speaker 1>of his hips.</v>

679
00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:33.220
<v Speaker 1>Apparently his hips just fucked up from</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those years of spinning around and</v>

680
00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:36.490
<v Speaker 1>throwing kicks and fucking doing this</v>
<v Speaker 1>hip throw away,</v>

681
00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:38.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he would do those shows.</v>

682
00:31:38.771 --> 00:31:40.720
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was super active and he was always</v>

683
00:31:40.721 --> 00:31:45.370
<v Speaker 1>just dropping down and do whole splits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's probably not the best way to</v>

684
00:31:45.371 --> 00:31:47.680
<v Speaker 1>treat your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a lot of that stuff was super</v>

685
00:31:47.681 --> 00:31:50.890
<v Speaker 1>impressive because it was like real</v>
<v Speaker 1>explosive and now he had spin around</v>

686
00:31:50.891 --> 00:31:53.050
<v Speaker 1>with his guitar and dropped down and do</v>
<v Speaker 1>the splits.</v>

687
00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:58.080
<v Speaker 1>It's like wwe moves</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she has like those wrestlers and</v>

688
00:31:58.481 --> 00:31:59.380
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go hook too.</v>

689
00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:03.340
<v Speaker 1>When I'm Dave Chappelle had that whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit about prince being a really good</v>

690
00:32:03.341 --> 00:32:06.280
<v Speaker 1>basketball player with Charlie Murphy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense.</v>

691
00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:08.770
<v Speaker 1>Like of course he is looking at how fast</v>

<v Speaker 2>Why did she have a million hits?</v>

731
00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.810
<v Speaker 2>She's so good when she's on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

732
00:33:59.811 --> 00:34:03.710

736
00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:14.810
<v Speaker 4>She might be like sensitive or something</v>
<v Speaker 4>happened to her probably getting turned</v>

737
00:34:14.811 --> 00:34:16.460
<v Speaker 4>off from the business or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

738
00:34:16.461 --> 00:34:18.470
<v Speaker 4>do you remember when she tore up that</v>
<v Speaker 4>picture of the pope?</v>

739
00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:20.930
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was a big problem.</v>

740
00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:24.200
<v Speaker 4>I think she wasn't ready for that</v>
<v Speaker 4>negativity that came with that,</v>

741
00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:26.780
<v Speaker 4>that opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was like 20 years ahead of time.</v>

742
00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:28.400
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>

743
00:34:28.401 --> 00:34:29.420
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She was right.</v>

744
00:34:29.421 --> 00:34:30.770
<v Speaker 4>Isn't that crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>She was right.</v>

745
00:34:30.771 --> 00:34:32.300
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If she did that shit today,</v>

746
00:34:32.301 --> 00:34:34.070
<v Speaker 4>people would support her and cheer for</v>
<v Speaker 4>her.</v>

747
00:34:34.071 --> 00:34:36.830
<v Speaker 4>She's a very brave person in that</v>
<v Speaker 4>regard.</v>

748
00:34:36.831 --> 00:34:37.820
<v Speaker 4>Then if she did it today,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'd be like,</v>

749
00:34:37.821 --> 00:34:38.910
<v Speaker 4>she's a hack.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

750
00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:44.870
<v Speaker 2>Then she did it too soon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's too original.</v>

751
00:34:44.930 --> 00:34:48.350
<v Speaker 2>Too soon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was this kid a long time ago that</v>

752
00:34:48.351 --> 00:34:52.790
<v Speaker 2>had an MTV music video and people were</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying that this kid is the future of</v>

753
00:34:52.791 --> 00:34:56.530
<v Speaker 2>rock and roll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was like 19 years old on the um,</v>

754
00:34:57.020 --> 00:34:59.030
<v Speaker 2>he had a song called beat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so lonely,</v>

755
00:34:59.060 --> 00:34:59.990
<v Speaker 2>fine,</v>

756
00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:04.370
<v Speaker 2>Who fucking sings that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this dude was like a bad ass</v>

757
00:35:04.371 --> 00:35:07.370
<v Speaker 2>guitarist and he was like 19 years old</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was one of those things where</v>

758
00:35:07.371 --> 00:35:08.540
<v Speaker 2>they were hyping them up.</v>

759
00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:12.080
<v Speaker 2>Charlie sexton.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if we play this,</v>

760
00:35:12.081 --> 00:35:13.490
<v Speaker 2>it will probably get us kicked off</v>

<v Speaker 2>dials on the mixing board and all these</v>

774
00:35:59.941 --> 00:36:04.941

775
00:36:06.361 --> 00:36:11.361
<v Speaker 2>obviously contrived,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as a 15 what does I 17 I guess.</v>

777
00:36:13.471 --> 00:36:15.030
<v Speaker 2>I remember thinking,</v>

779
00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:26.400
<v Speaker 2>And he's like smoking cigarettes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hanging out with these rockers</v>

780
00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:30.280
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not playing in any of this song</v>

781
00:36:30.281 --> 00:36:31.810

<v Speaker 2>It's just the,</v>

782
00:36:32.830 --> 00:36:36.460
<v Speaker 2>but he like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his singing is kind of interesting too,</v>

783
00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:42.020
<v Speaker 2>but they put so much effort into this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

784
00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:43.280
<v Speaker 2>it was one of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

785
00:36:43.281 --> 00:36:45.500
<v Speaker 2>well they're for sure going to force</v>
<v Speaker 2>feed us this guy</v>

786
00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:52.920
<v Speaker 4>like</v>

792
00:37:03.771 --> 00:37:06.440
<v Speaker 2>I've really liked this song,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when it came out when I was</v>

793
00:37:06.441 --> 00:37:10.400
<v Speaker 2>17 and I thought this fucking guy was</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be giant.</v>

794
00:37:10.401 --> 00:37:12.890
<v Speaker 2>He had all the right pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't have tattoos back then cause</v>

795
00:37:12.891 --> 00:37:14.660
<v Speaker 2>dude didn't have tattoos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if he,</v>

796
00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:16.880
<v Speaker 2>if it was today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would have tattoos all over his hands</v>

797
00:37:16.881 --> 00:37:19.430
<v Speaker 2>and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had some shit on written on his neck,</v>

798
00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:21.620
<v Speaker 2>but he's got all the right bracelets,</v>

799
00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:27.200
<v Speaker 4>his hair like his bracelet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his hair looks perfect.</v>

800
00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:29.540
<v Speaker 4>So there was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want him to listen to this show and</v>

801
00:37:29.541 --> 00:37:31.820

<v Speaker 4>Where is he now?</v>

802
00:37:31.930 --> 00:37:34.390
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I'm wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's like a giant country star.</v>

803
00:37:34.510 --> 00:37:37.000
<v Speaker 2>There's country stars that you don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>even know about that I'm like fucking</v>

00:37:46.410 --> 00:37:47.620
<v Speaker 2>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting high.</v>

808
00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:53.440
<v Speaker 2>You got to in this room we hotbox Ian</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying it's kind of adversity.</v>

809
00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:57.400
<v Speaker 2>Anybody tells you you can't get hot box</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a fucking liar too,</v>

810
00:37:57.401 --> 00:37:59.320
<v Speaker 2>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you that right now.</v>

811
00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:03.520
<v Speaker 2>Somebody trying to tell me the other day</v>
<v Speaker 2>that hotboxing isn't real.</v>

812
00:38:03.521 --> 00:38:05.140
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you talking about?</v>

813
00:38:05.141 --> 00:38:06.430
<v Speaker 2>It's 100% real</v>

814
00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:09.960
<v Speaker 4>breathing in weed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In a room with his weed.</v>

815
00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:11.880
<v Speaker 4>Smoking weed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

816
00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:14.580
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's not as effective as taking a</v>
<v Speaker 4>hit,</v>

817
00:38:14.581 --> 00:38:17.490
<v Speaker 4>but it's pretty close.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you stand there long enough and</v>

818
00:38:17.491 --> 00:38:18.780
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the room is like,</v>

819
00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:22.530
<v Speaker 4>like if this is a lot of weed going</v>
<v Speaker 4>around and the room is small and it's</v>

820
00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:25.200
<v Speaker 4>intense and it's in the air,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's all you're going to breathe in</v>

821
00:38:25.201 --> 00:38:28.350
<v Speaker 4>all your breathing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It might be more than taking a few hits</v>

822
00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:30.390
<v Speaker 4>if when out in the street with some</v>
<v Speaker 4>friends.</v>

823
00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:30.760
<v Speaker 4>Did</v>

824
00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:33.860
<v Speaker 2>I ever tell you about when I was a judge</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the cannabis club?</v>

825
00:38:34.110 --> 00:38:35.770
<v Speaker 2>Cannabis Cup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cannabis Cup?</v>

826
00:38:36.370 --> 00:38:38.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I judged the Cannabis Cup one year and</v>

827
00:38:38.951 --> 00:38:41.220
<v Speaker 2>they would hand you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know how like um,</v>

828
00:38:41.830 --> 00:38:44.860
<v Speaker 2>old people that I've liked hip injuries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they carry around a lot of pills.</v>

829
00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:47.450
<v Speaker 2>They'll have like a Monday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tuesday,</v>

830
00:38:47.450 --> 00:38:47.450
<v Speaker 2>Wednesday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thursday,</v>

831
00:38:47.450 --> 00:38:49.450
<v Speaker 2>Friday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Saturday when I was little seven tray</v>

832
00:38:49.690 --> 00:38:52.030
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what they gave you and it was</v>

833
00:38:52.031 --> 00:38:56.800
<v Speaker 2>filled with weed and they were handing</v>
<v Speaker 2>out pipes and lighters and edibles and</v>

834
00:38:56.801 --> 00:39:00.610
<v Speaker 2>it was so ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea that anybody got judged,</v>

835
00:39:00.850 --> 00:39:04.690
<v Speaker 2>which is so ridiculous because it was me</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a bunch of other people who are</v>

836
00:39:04.691 --> 00:39:07.990
<v Speaker 2>judges like people from the local</v>
<v Speaker 2>cannabis community and I think there was</v>

837
00:39:07.991 --> 00:39:12.991
<v Speaker 2>some wrappers in there as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But by the time your on pot number two</v>

838
00:39:14.890 --> 00:39:16.250
<v Speaker 2>like who knows what's happening.</v>

839
00:39:16.350 --> 00:39:19.290
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you know if three is affecting</v>

840
00:39:19.291 --> 00:39:23.420
<v Speaker 4>you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's affecting you or five or one is</v>

841
00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:25.770
<v Speaker 4>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't have any idea.</v>

842
00:39:25.771 --> 00:39:30.210
<v Speaker 4>You have to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Each one for a day you do one and then</v>

843
00:39:30.211 --> 00:39:32.190
<v Speaker 4>you'd come back the next day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do the other one.</v>

844
00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:34.380
<v Speaker 4>And that still might not be enough time.</v>

845
00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:37.570
<v Speaker 2>I think it's 100% right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you also would have to deal</v>

846
00:39:37.571 --> 00:39:39.430
<v Speaker 2>with the fact that if you did it on</v>
<v Speaker 2>Monday,</v>

847
00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:40.780
<v Speaker 2>Tuesday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well if you did it everyday like that,</v>

848
00:39:40.810 --> 00:39:42.550
<v Speaker 2>your body would get accustomed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting high.</v>

849
00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:45.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you probably get less high as the</v>

850
00:39:45.730 --> 00:39:47.940
<v Speaker 2>week goes on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but some people say that they're like</v>

851
00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:49.200
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get accustomed.</v>

852
00:39:49.201 --> 00:39:50.770
<v Speaker 2>Different strength.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's Joey Diaz though.</v>

853
00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:52.240
<v Speaker 2>Joey Diaz.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen dog.</v>

854
00:39:52.241 --> 00:39:55.840
<v Speaker 2>I smoked different shit every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want these motherfuckers getting</v>

855
00:39:55.841 --> 00:40:00.841
<v Speaker 2>used to me like he used to meet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he thinks you get used to certain kinds</v>

856
00:40:01.421 --> 00:40:03.760
<v Speaker 2>of weeds and they don't fact they don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>affect you anymore.</v>

857
00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:06.580
<v Speaker 2>So you got to try new shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He might,</v>

858
00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:09.590
<v Speaker 2>he might be on to something though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's right.</v>

859
00:40:10.290 --> 00:40:12.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's right too in some sort of a</v>

860
00:40:12.221 --> 00:40:15.630
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For sure was like sativas versus in</v>

861
00:40:15.631 --> 00:40:17.410
<v Speaker 2>because there's definitely a different</v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling.</v>

862
00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:19.900
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what were some of the strains here</v>

863
00:40:19.901 --> 00:40:21.190
<v Speaker 2>you can get out of the story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've just,</v>

864
00:40:21.250 --> 00:40:23.230
<v Speaker 2>you can try it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just smoke one for a week,</v>

865
00:40:24.550 --> 00:40:25.540
<v Speaker 2>just get a different one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

866
00:40:25.541 --> 00:40:26.490
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

867
00:40:26.530 --> 00:40:29.710
<v Speaker 2>You can get cheaper weed instead of</v>
<v Speaker 2>smoking all the top shelf stuff.</v>

868
00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:30.670
<v Speaker 2>What's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's fucking me up.</v>

869
00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:33.780
<v Speaker 2>No Sativa or this is a sativa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

870
00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:36.010
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you what it's called.</v>

871
00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:39.340
<v Speaker 2>They labeled,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are all from la speed.</v>

872
00:40:39.341 --> 00:40:41.950
<v Speaker 2>We'd la speed weeds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way to go,</v>

873
00:40:41.951 --> 00:40:43.630
<v Speaker 2>ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're in Los Angeles,</v>

874
00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:47.500
<v Speaker 2>Los Angeles is the most ridiculous thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the world because they're trying to</v>

875
00:40:47.501 --> 00:40:51.170
<v Speaker 2>stop that and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to stop it and some weird</v>

876
00:40:51.171 --> 00:40:55.450
<v Speaker 2>there some sort of a zoning way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what they're trying to say is</v>

877
00:40:55.451 --> 00:40:59.740
<v Speaker 2>because he's delivering it like where he</v>
<v Speaker 2>selling it becomes a place of business.</v>

878
00:40:59.950 --> 00:41:02.140
<v Speaker 2>So it has to be zoned in a certain way.</v>

879
00:41:02.530 --> 00:41:05.840
<v Speaker 2>Like this is the argument,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is ridiculous because how would</v>

880
00:41:05.841 --> 00:41:08.890
<v Speaker 2>fast food restaurants deliver?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how a domino's deliver,</v>

881
00:41:08.910 --> 00:41:11.680
<v Speaker 2>cause these places aren't zoned for</v>
<v Speaker 2>being restaurants.</v>

882
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:13.990
<v Speaker 2>Like if someone just shows up at your</v>
<v Speaker 2>house with a pizza,</v>

883
00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:17.320
<v Speaker 2>like your house doesn't have to be zoned</v>
<v Speaker 2>for being a restaurant for him to show</v>

884
00:41:17.321 --> 00:41:20.290
<v Speaker 2>up at your house with a pizza.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if someone shows up at your house</v>

885
00:41:20.291 --> 00:41:23.950
<v Speaker 2>selling weed and you live next to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>school,</v>

886
00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:25.750
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it becomes problematic.</v>

887
00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:28.150
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an interesting argument.</v>

888
00:41:28.151 --> 00:41:30.130
<v Speaker 2>It's going to go away because it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>silly,</v>

889
00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:32.650
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to cost a lot of people some</v>

890
00:41:32.651 --> 00:41:35.870
<v Speaker 2>money and probably Gino from lsp weed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to cost him.</v>

891
00:41:35.871 --> 00:41:36.250
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

892
00:41:36.250 --> 00:41:37.980
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it seems like something the city makes</v>

893
00:41:37.981 --> 00:41:39.060
<v Speaker 4>up to try to make some money.</v>

894
00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:40.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably,</v>

895
00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:43.240
<v Speaker 2>well maybe it might be someone who is</v>
<v Speaker 2>anti weed who is at the,</v>

896
00:41:43.241 --> 00:41:44.160
<v Speaker 2>at the top,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I haven't,</v>

897
00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:46.870
<v Speaker 2>I have some friends that are not pot</v>
<v Speaker 2>smokers.</v>

898
00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:49.600
<v Speaker 2>Don't like pot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't believe in pot and they're,</v>

899
00:41:49.601 --> 00:41:51.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>older than me and they,</v>

900
00:41:51.821 --> 00:41:56.821
<v Speaker 2>they'll still hang on to some of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>silly ideas about pot and they'll go,</v>

901
00:41:56.911 --> 00:41:58.710
<v Speaker 2>well you are different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

902
00:41:58.720 --> 00:41:59.960
<v Speaker 2>to me I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

903
00:41:59.961 --> 00:42:02.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what are you talking about that I'm</v>

904
00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:05.380
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>90% of potheads are like me.</v>

905
00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:09.130
<v Speaker 2>Like it's the ones who stand out are the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ones that are the outliers.</v>

906
00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:11.710
<v Speaker 2>It's the ones with the dirty fee and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking,</v>

907
00:42:11.711 --> 00:42:14.860
<v Speaker 2>the macrame clothes and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>playing fucking,</v>

908
00:42:14.861 --> 00:42:18.430
<v Speaker 2>what is that thing that you've kicked</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ball with your foot hacky sack.</v>

909
00:42:18.730 --> 00:42:19.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

910
00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:20.970
<v Speaker 4>It's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like when you belong to a group,</v>

911
00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:26.220
<v Speaker 4>there's always an annoying section of</v>
<v Speaker 4>that group that makes you not want to</v>

912
00:42:26.221 --> 00:42:29.520
<v Speaker 4>belong to that group of customers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's where the black people or gay</v>

913
00:42:29.521 --> 00:42:30.720
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a certain type of gay people,</v>

914
00:42:30.721 --> 00:42:35.670
<v Speaker 4>like other gay people like can't stand</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it might give gay people a bad</v>

915
00:42:35.671 --> 00:42:40.671
<v Speaker 4>look and they say same thing with weed</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then then somebody who's against</v>

916
00:42:40.831 --> 00:42:43.170
<v Speaker 4>that thing completely meets you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I've been,</v>

917
00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:46.810
<v Speaker 4>you know like when I was a teenager or</v>
<v Speaker 4>white people got,</v>

918
00:42:46.890 --> 00:42:51.360
<v Speaker 4>you're different than other black guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was an insult for sure.</v>

919
00:42:51.361 --> 00:42:54.840
<v Speaker 4>That's like in the social justice</v>
<v Speaker 4>warrior handbook or how not to talk to</v>

920
00:42:54.841 --> 00:42:55.800
<v Speaker 4>black guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

921
00:42:56.020 --> 00:42:58.980
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's almost as bad as saying,</v>

922
00:42:58.981 --> 00:43:01.110
<v Speaker 4>Nigga,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're telling me I'd rather you</v>

923
00:43:01.111 --> 00:43:05.460
<v Speaker 4>call me nigger at that point</v>
<v Speaker 4>because now you're telling me I'm not</v>

924
00:43:05.490 --> 00:43:06.910
<v Speaker 4>black enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

925
00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:09.000
<v Speaker 4>I'm saying right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And first of all,</v>

926
00:43:09.001 --> 00:43:11.130
<v Speaker 4>you don't know any other black people</v>
<v Speaker 4>were working at Burger King.</v>

927
00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:13.820
<v Speaker 4>I'm the first one you met,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you're only listing.</v>

928
00:43:13.970 --> 00:43:16.020
<v Speaker 4>The only thing you know about black</v>
<v Speaker 4>people is what you see on the news.</v>

929
00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:18.780
<v Speaker 4>So then you and you meet me and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't feel threatened.</v>

930
00:43:19.170 --> 00:43:20.880
<v Speaker 4>Then you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not like other black guys,</v>

931
00:43:20.881 --> 00:43:23.760
<v Speaker 4>but I'm the only black person you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You live in a all white neighborhood.</v>

932
00:43:23.761 --> 00:43:25.710
<v Speaker 4>I'm working in an all white neighborhood</v>
<v Speaker 4>burger king.</v>

933
00:43:26.430 --> 00:43:27.570
<v Speaker 4>That's hilarious.</v>

934
00:43:28.350 --> 00:43:30.330
<v Speaker 2>True.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why one of the reasons why New</v>

935
00:43:30.330 --> 00:43:33.630
<v Speaker 2>York City is such a good place to live</v>
<v Speaker 2>because everybody integrates,</v>

936
00:43:33.631 --> 00:43:34.830
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because New York City,</v>

937
00:43:34.831 --> 00:43:37.140
<v Speaker 2>everybody's on the subway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's walking on the street and</v>

938
00:43:37.141 --> 00:43:38.370
<v Speaker 2>everybody's around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody.</v>

939
00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:43.110
<v Speaker 2>One of the weird things about la in</v>
<v Speaker 2>general is that it's a car culture and</v>

940
00:43:43.230 --> 00:43:47.010
<v Speaker 2>you were in your little isolated box and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you drive to your little isolated</v>

941
00:43:47.011 --> 00:43:51.420
<v Speaker 2>community and then you go back and forth</v>
<v Speaker 2>from work to wherever you hang out and</v>

942
00:43:51.421 --> 00:43:55.080
<v Speaker 2>those are your spots and you don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>interact with other people like face to</v>

943
00:43:55.081 --> 00:43:57.090
<v Speaker 2>face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>person to person on a daily basis.</v>

944
00:43:57.570 --> 00:43:58.950
<v Speaker 2>Just the best thing about New York.</v>

945
00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:00.600
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause that trey,</v>

946
00:44:00.601 --> 00:44:01.920
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody's on that track.</v>

947
00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:05.240
<v Speaker 4>All kinds of people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because even if you're rich enough to</v>

948
00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:08.240
<v Speaker 4>take,</v>
<v Speaker 4>take a taxi,</v>

949
00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:12.260
<v Speaker 4>it's traffic up there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The train is still the fastest place.</v>

950
00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:15.500
<v Speaker 4>Fastest way to get somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The only way it's mixed,</v>

951
00:44:15.501 --> 00:44:16.850
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's good.</v>

952
00:44:17.690 --> 00:44:21.590
<v Speaker 2>It's V it's super important too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because one of the things that I think</v>

953
00:44:21.930 --> 00:44:24.680
<v Speaker 2>everybody who I know who used to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>poor,</v>

954
00:44:24.790 --> 00:44:26.570
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ron White and I were talking about this</v>

955
00:44:26.571 --> 00:44:28.010
<v Speaker 2>the other night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when,</v>

956
00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:29.720
<v Speaker 2>when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you haven't made it,</v>

957
00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:30.793
<v Speaker 2>when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're,</v>

958
00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:34.280
<v Speaker 2>you always feel like it's never gonna</v>
<v Speaker 2>happen,</v>

959
00:44:34.490 --> 00:44:36.210
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You always feel like it's completely out</v>

960
00:44:36.211 --> 00:44:37.290
<v Speaker 2>of touch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

961
00:44:37.291 --> 00:44:39.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm poor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm always going to be poor.</v>

962
00:44:39.631 --> 00:44:41.580
<v Speaker 2>This fucking struggles never gonna go</v>
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>

963
00:44:42.090 --> 00:44:45.420
<v Speaker 2>But when you're around people who used</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be poor too,</v>

964
00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:48.060
<v Speaker 2>but they figured out how to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go,</v>

965
00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:49.950
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just a fucking person.</v>

966
00:44:50.490 --> 00:44:52.460
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you see some dude and he's on</v>

967
00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:57.450
<v Speaker 2>some corner office and some giant ass</v>
<v Speaker 2>building and he's a ceo of that company,</v>

968
00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:02.340
<v Speaker 2>you can't imagine that at one point in</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy's life he was fucked up.</v>

969
00:45:02.670 --> 00:45:05.950
<v Speaker 2>Like at one point in his life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's depressed and lost and failing in</v>

970
00:45:05.951 --> 00:45:07.470
<v Speaker 2>school and couldn't figure it out.</v>

971
00:45:07.490 --> 00:45:07.980
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

972
00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:12.160
<v Speaker 2>and was wondering about his future,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but almost everybody has lows.</v>

973
00:45:12.330 --> 00:45:17.070
<v Speaker 2>What's everybody has almost every</v>
<v Speaker 2>successful person that I've ever met had</v>

974
00:45:17.071 --> 00:45:20.820
<v Speaker 2>some crazy adversity early on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They figured their way through that and</v>

975
00:45:20.821 --> 00:45:24.090
<v Speaker 2>then they figured out how to become</v>
<v Speaker 2>successful parsley even because of that.</v>

976
00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:26.610
<v Speaker 2>So when you're on like a train and</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's all together,</v>

977
00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:31.940
<v Speaker 2>then I think it's the one of the best</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of ways to keep that separation</v>

978
00:45:32.550 --> 00:45:37.550
<v Speaker 2>that us and them separation with like</v>
<v Speaker 2>the classes especially because that's a</v>

979
00:45:39.211 --> 00:45:44.211
<v Speaker 2>real fucking mindset of rich people and</v>
<v Speaker 2>a real mindset of poor people that</v>

980
00:45:45.301 --> 00:45:47.490
<v Speaker 2>they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's two different groups of us,</v>

981
00:45:47.850 --> 00:45:49.940
<v Speaker 2>but it's so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not it,</v>

982
00:45:50.070 --> 00:45:53.940
<v Speaker 2>it's just a bunch of people and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the same journey that you're on in a</v>

983
00:45:53.941 --> 00:45:57.060
<v Speaker 2>different direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just maybe a little bit further down the</v>

984
00:45:57.061 --> 00:45:57.894
<v Speaker 2>road,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

985
00:45:57.990 --> 00:46:00.240
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe they didn't stop as many times</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you did.</v>

986
00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:03.900
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they didn't get flat tires.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they didn't have as many potholes</v>

987
00:46:03.901 --> 00:46:05.250
<v Speaker 2>in the road,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're all,</v>

988
00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:07.500
<v Speaker 2>we're all just on this fucking same</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

989
00:46:07.501 --> 00:46:10.080
<v Speaker 2>We're all just people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when you look at some dude,</v>

990
00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:13.140
<v Speaker 2>you know and you're poor and you got</v>
<v Speaker 2>holes in your sneakers and some guys get</v>

991
00:46:13.141 --> 00:46:17.370
<v Speaker 2>a rolex on and he's wearing this</v>
<v Speaker 2>expensive suit and he's got cuff links</v>

992
00:46:17.371 --> 00:46:20.310
<v Speaker 2>and he's checking his newspaper and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Reading The Wall Street Journal and you</v>

993
00:46:20.311 --> 00:46:23.100
<v Speaker 2>look at is expensive shoes like this</v>
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker's got some money,</v>

994
00:46:23.101 --> 00:46:24.840
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How the hell did he do that?</v>

995
00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:27.750
<v Speaker 2>And I'm here a loser.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just did it.</v>

996
00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:29.630
<v Speaker 2>He's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just a person just like,</v>

997
00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:30.690
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't,</v>

998
00:46:30.690 --> 00:46:33.140
<v Speaker 1>you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He never look at it as a origin story.</v>

999
00:46:33.290 --> 00:46:35.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just look straight at Batman doing doing</v>

1000
00:46:35.991 --> 00:46:37.040
<v Speaker 1>this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1001
00:46:37.041 --> 00:46:38.270
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see what he had to go through too.</v>

1002
00:46:38.330 --> 00:46:40.010
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a good point and learn all that</v>

1003
00:46:40.011 --> 00:46:41.750
<v Speaker 1>shit to way to put it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you want to,</v>

<v Speaker 1>but it seems like it's impossible.</v>

1006
00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:47.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Speaking of getting there,</v>

00:48:01.831 --> 00:48:03.990
<v Speaker 4>They actually in number that number two</v>
<v Speaker 4>spot right now,</v>

1036
00:48:03.991 --> 00:48:08.730
<v Speaker 4>but last year they finished maybe second</v>
<v Speaker 4>or third at the end there they have less</v>

1037
00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:14.030
<v Speaker 4>money but their coaches are ex Argentina</v>
<v Speaker 4>player and he figured out a system where</v>

1038
00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:18.840
<v Speaker 4>they just hustle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just out hustle you,</v>

1039
00:48:19.020 --> 00:48:22.110
<v Speaker 4>you get the ball and there's three</v>
<v Speaker 4>motherfuckers on you and you're going to</v>

1040
00:48:22.111 --> 00:48:25.890
<v Speaker 4>cough it up and they're going to get it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they all score one or two goals game</v>

1041
00:48:26.130 --> 00:48:28.130
<v Speaker 4>and that's enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

1042
00:48:28.131 --> 00:48:32.610
<v Speaker 4>and buying is just so really skilled</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they might be able to,</v>

1043
00:48:33.170 --> 00:48:36.870
<v Speaker 4>they beat most teams,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but athletics is just so disciplined</v>

1044
00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:38.410
<v Speaker 4>that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

1045
00:48:38.411 --> 00:48:42.030
<v Speaker 4>they knocked them out and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're going to the Champions League</v>

1046
00:48:42.031 --> 00:48:45.930
<v Speaker 4>final versus Real Madrid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's two Spanish teams in the</v>

1047
00:48:45.931 --> 00:48:49.020
<v Speaker 4>champion's league final and both of them</v>
<v Speaker 4>are from the same city.</v>

1048
00:48:49.021 --> 00:48:52.650
<v Speaker 4>So it's like the Lakers versus the</v>
<v Speaker 4>clippers for like the best.</v>

1049
00:48:53.490 --> 00:48:56.420
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the championship of w w what,</v>

1050
00:48:56.910 --> 00:48:59.370
<v Speaker 4>what are we in like the up North America</v>

1051
00:49:00.070 --> 00:49:03.170
<v Speaker 1>blip when we do it in North America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we call it the world championships.</v>

1052
00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:06.570
<v Speaker 1>We call it the what the NBA is the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>championship.</v>

1053
00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:07.413
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1054
00:49:07.570 --> 00:49:09.230
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like just cause it's all the best</v>

1055
00:49:09.231 --> 00:49:10.130
<v Speaker 1>players in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1056
00:49:10.330 --> 00:49:10.911
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1057
00:49:10.911 --> 00:49:14.540
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like when they do it in the World</v>

1058
00:49:14.540 --> 00:49:16.100
<v Speaker 1>Cup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it actually is the world is the world.</v>

1059
00:49:16.101 --> 00:49:17.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is the world because there's not</v>

1060
00:49:17.541 --> 00:49:21.500
<v Speaker 1>really any competition coming over from</v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe trying to play against the</v>

1061
00:49:21.501 --> 00:49:22.550
<v Speaker 1>Lakers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1062
00:49:22.580 --> 00:49:25.520
<v Speaker 1>It's just not really going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to have a team that</v>

1063
00:49:25.521 --> 00:49:27.800
<v Speaker 1>they develop overseas that can compete</v>
<v Speaker 1>with an la,</v>

1064
00:49:27.980 --> 00:49:32.410
<v Speaker 4>like basketball has this thing where I</v>
<v Speaker 4>think they have like all the North</v>

1065
00:49:32.410 --> 00:49:35.320
<v Speaker 4>American Dab a tournament where all the</v>
<v Speaker 4>like Brazil and,</v>

1066
00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:39.650
<v Speaker 4>and like all the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we in North America,</v>

1067
00:49:40.830 --> 00:49:42.860
<v Speaker 1>all the North American teams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's really asset.</v>

1068
00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:46.050
<v Speaker 1>Listen man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were born in another country just</v>

1069
00:49:46.051 --> 00:49:46.980
<v Speaker 1>been hot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boxed.</v>

1070
00:49:49.350 --> 00:49:50.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the fuck is that</v>

1071
00:49:50.850 --> 00:49:52.470
<v Speaker 4>just be hot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hotbox so,</v>

1072
00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:54.103
<v Speaker 4>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1073
00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:57.930
<v Speaker 4>like all the countries play around this</v>
<v Speaker 4>area,</v>

1074
00:49:58.080 --> 00:50:00.300
<v Speaker 4>around this area,</v>
<v Speaker 4>play against each other.</v>

1075
00:50:00.301 --> 00:50:03.210
<v Speaker 4>And I guess America normally wins.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But this is,</v>

1076
00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:04.830
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>

1077
00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:06.910
<v Speaker 4>this is a big tournament man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1078
00:50:06.980 --> 00:50:07.510
<v Speaker 4>This is the,</v>

1079
00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:08.980
<v Speaker 1>the actual whole world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

1080
00:50:09.010 --> 00:50:10.810
<v Speaker 1>That's what I want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I was thinking like are there any</v>

1081
00:50:10.811 --> 00:50:15.700
<v Speaker 1>sports with the United States competes</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the whole world and does well in</v>

1082
00:50:15.701 --> 00:50:16.451
<v Speaker 1>soccer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1083
00:50:16.451 --> 00:50:18.250
<v Speaker 1>In any other sport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1084
00:50:18.490 --> 00:50:20.230
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just say the difference in this too</v>

1085
00:50:20.231 --> 00:50:22.120
<v Speaker 1>is what you're thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess maybe World Cup,</v>

1086
00:50:22.121 --> 00:50:24.370
<v Speaker 1>his team teams for countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1087
00:50:24.371 --> 00:50:25.220
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1088
00:50:25.230 --> 00:50:28.040
<v Speaker 1>teams for professional clubs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Teams are owned and that like,</v>

1089
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:30.950
<v Speaker 4>so these teams wouldn't necessarily play</v>
<v Speaker 4>the United States.</v>

1090
00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:34.160
<v Speaker 4>They would play like the Columbus crew</v>
<v Speaker 4>or the good la Galaxy.</v>

1091
00:50:34.850 --> 00:50:38.630
<v Speaker 4>They're not on the same skill level.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it would be a really bad game when</v>

1092
00:50:38.631 --> 00:50:41.180
<v Speaker 4>someone says like Manchester United,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a club.</v>

1093
00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:46.220
<v Speaker 4>It's a club that's like the Yankees,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Yankees in soccer in England.</v>

1094
00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:51.230
<v Speaker 4>But when you would think of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they would play against a bunch of</v>

1095
00:50:51.231 --> 00:50:52.450
<v Speaker 4>other different,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they also,</v>

1096
00:50:52.460 --> 00:50:56.030
<v Speaker 4>there's Real Madrid basketball team and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they wouldn't want to play against like</v>

1097
00:50:56.031 --> 00:50:59.120
<v Speaker 4>any NBA team cause they would get</v>
<v Speaker 4>destroyed the same way they would beat</v>

1098
00:50:59.121 --> 00:51:02.990
<v Speaker 4>our soccer teams.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the United States play Spain and</v>

1099
00:51:02.991 --> 00:51:05.960
<v Speaker 4>like World Cup type competition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we also have something like that</v>

1100
00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:08.210
<v Speaker 4>where it's a conch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a calf and it's like United States</v>

1101
00:51:08.211 --> 00:51:11.810
<v Speaker 4>versus Mexico versus some of the smaller</v>
<v Speaker 4>a Latin American country.</v>

1102
00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:15.590
<v Speaker 4>What I was getting at was is there a</v>
<v Speaker 4>sport where the United States is</v>

1103
00:51:15.591 --> 00:51:19.070
<v Speaker 4>competitive in a world stage?</v>

1104
00:51:19.580 --> 00:51:21.280
<v Speaker 4>Like a sport?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas yeah,</v>

1105
00:51:21.290 --> 00:51:23.600
<v Speaker 4>like basketball we're usually like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1106
00:51:23.601 --> 00:51:25.550
<v Speaker 4>but we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the world doesn't play basketball.</v>

1107
00:51:25.580 --> 00:51:28.010
<v Speaker 4>The problem with us being competitive at</v>
<v Speaker 4>basketball.</v>

1108
00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:30.320
<v Speaker 4>It's like someone over here being a</v>
<v Speaker 4>cricket champion.</v>

1109
00:51:30.820 --> 00:51:34.340
<v Speaker 4>Nobody gives a fuck if you go to Greece</v>
<v Speaker 4>or Turkey or Spain,</v>

1110
00:51:34.341 --> 00:51:37.150
<v Speaker 4>they have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have their version of the MBA,</v>

1111
00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:40.130
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have their version of the NBA,</v>

1112
00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:44.780
<v Speaker 4>but the those teams and those plays are</v>
<v Speaker 4>not as good as ours and they come from</v>

1113
00:51:44.781 --> 00:51:47.060
<v Speaker 4>all different countries and then when</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1114
00:51:47.210 --> 00:51:48.800
<v Speaker 4>when it's time for you to play for your</v>
<v Speaker 4>country,</v>

1115
00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:50.650
<v Speaker 4>you're still not as good as American and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

1116
00:51:50.970 --> 00:51:53.960
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's when in the Olympics they</v>

1117
00:51:53.961 --> 00:51:55.790
<v Speaker 4>have a world championship for</v>
<v Speaker 4>basketball,</v>

1118
00:51:55.791 --> 00:51:56.690
<v Speaker 4>for real,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

1119
00:51:57.010 --> 00:52:00.380
<v Speaker 4>And they have the Olympics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is like the one that everybody</v>

1120
00:52:00.381 --> 00:52:03.350
<v Speaker 4>pays attention to the Moose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's where all the countries get</v>

1121
00:52:03.351 --> 00:52:06.260
<v Speaker 4>together and play basketball.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But isn't it fascinating that</v>

1122
00:52:06.580 --> 00:52:11.500
<v Speaker 2>there's a clear winner as far as like</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is the best still when,</v>

1123
00:52:11.501 --> 00:52:14.650
<v Speaker 2>what is basketball really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's moving your feet,</v>

1124
00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:17.320
<v Speaker 2>which everybody knows how to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Throwing a ball,</v>

1125
00:52:17.380 --> 00:52:21.400
<v Speaker 2>which most people know how to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>dribbling and then learning how to get</v>

1126
00:52:21.401 --> 00:52:23.620
<v Speaker 2>super awesome at all of those skills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1127
00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:27.760
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't seem like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like something where someone</v>

1128
00:52:27.761 --> 00:52:32.050
<v Speaker 2>has to teach you some master strategist</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's like the greatest snow world has</v>

1129
00:52:32.051 --> 00:52:33.940
<v Speaker 2>to teach you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's almost like a form of</v>

1130
00:52:33.941 --> 00:52:35.200
<v Speaker 2>expression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1131
00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:37.750
<v Speaker 2>It's like why are Americans so much</v>
<v Speaker 2>better at it?</v>

1132
00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:40.730
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1133
00:52:40.740 --> 00:52:44.350
<v Speaker 4>It's like in soccer Brazil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I've been trying to ask myself the</v>

1134
00:52:44.351 --> 00:52:46.200
<v Speaker 4>saint cause why is Brazil so good at</v>
<v Speaker 4>soccer?</v>

1135
00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:47.570
<v Speaker 4>They love it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1136
00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:49.350
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they but it's a lot of countries around</v>

1137
00:52:49.351 --> 00:52:52.680
<v Speaker 4>the world love it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they have like five world cup</v>

1138
00:52:52.681 --> 00:52:54.240
<v Speaker 4>championships.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well maybe six.</v>

1139
00:52:54.330 --> 00:52:55.163
<v Speaker 4>Germany's good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1140
00:52:55.230 --> 00:52:59.760
<v Speaker 2>Zyl has a great history of soccer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like with Palae of course.</v>

1141
00:53:00.120 --> 00:53:04.620
<v Speaker 2>But they also have a great history of</v>
<v Speaker 2>like nationalism and competitive</v>

1142
00:53:04.621 --> 00:53:07.110
<v Speaker 2>athletics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like thinking about how many Brazilian</v>

1143
00:53:07.111 --> 00:53:10.320
<v Speaker 2>mma champions they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's so many.</v>

1144
00:53:10.321 --> 00:53:11.220
<v Speaker 2>Brazil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Roger,</v>

1145
00:53:11.221 --> 00:53:12.150
<v Speaker 2>Gracie,</v>

1146

<v Speaker 2>one fc last night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a Brazilian champion.</v>

1147
00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:17.700
<v Speaker 2>Like there's so many Brazilian</v>
<v Speaker 2>champions.</v>

1148
00:53:17.701 --> 00:53:22.701
<v Speaker 2>He choked out some dude in one FC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the Asia version of the UFC.</v>

1149
00:53:23.450 --> 00:53:24.870
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just getting bigger and bigger.</v>

1150
00:53:24.871 --> 00:53:29.871
<v Speaker 2>This a bunch of like really big</v>
<v Speaker 2>organizations overseas now there that</v>

1151
00:53:30.131 --> 00:53:34.080
<v Speaker 2>are starting to build up momentum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you look at like martial arts</v>

1152
00:53:34.081 --> 00:53:37.050
<v Speaker 2>champions from Brazil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ,</v>

1153
00:53:37.051 --> 00:53:39.900
<v Speaker 2>there's so many of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so many in the UFC,</v>

1154
00:53:39.901 --> 00:53:42.990
<v Speaker 2>so many former champions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so many elite high level fighters.</v>

1155
00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:48.440
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a card next weekend in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brazil and it's all like the killers of</v>

1156
00:53:48.691 --> 00:53:53.691
<v Speaker 2>the killer of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in Brazilian champions in Vitor</v>

1157
00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:57.210
<v Speaker 2>Belfort versus Jocker Ray Anderson</v>
<v Speaker 2>Silva's fighting Uriah Hall.</v>

1158
00:53:57.540 --> 00:53:59.280
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's incredible.</v>

1159
00:53:59.281 --> 00:54:02.130
<v Speaker 2>There's so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so much super high level talent</v>

1160
00:54:02.131 --> 00:54:03.750
<v Speaker 2>that came out of Brazil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brazil,</v>

1161
00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:05.010
<v Speaker 2>Uriah Faber.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1162
00:54:05.050 --> 00:54:05.701
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1163
00:54:05.701 --> 00:54:06.800
<v Speaker 2>you mean Ryan Hall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1164
00:54:06.801 --> 00:54:07.410
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>

1165
00:54:07.410 --> 00:54:09.990
<v Speaker 2>Halls black.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's from Jamaica,</v>

1166
00:54:09.991 --> 00:54:10.830
<v Speaker 2>I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1167
00:54:10.831 --> 00:54:13.170
<v Speaker 2>that big monster do too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1168
00:54:13.410 --> 00:54:14.790
<v Speaker 2>Robot dark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's cold.</v>

1169
00:54:15.390 --> 00:54:17.580
<v Speaker 2>Fucking lightning fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's one of my favorites.</v>

1170
00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:20.520
<v Speaker 2>That dude is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's such a nice guy too.</v>

1171
00:54:20.521 --> 00:54:22.260
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing about in the him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he like,</v>

1172
00:54:22.270 --> 00:54:24.480
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he made some like really heartfelt</v>

1173
00:54:24.481 --> 00:54:28.380
<v Speaker 2>statement once after one of his fights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1174
00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:30.510
<v Speaker 2>you know about people getting along.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

1175
00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:33.900
<v Speaker 2>this guy is like legit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this is really him.</v>

1176
00:54:33.901 --> 00:54:36.630
<v Speaker 2>He's such a nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's almost been one of the things</v>

1177
00:54:36.631 --> 00:54:39.840
<v Speaker 2>that held him back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Dana White did criticized him of it</v>

1178
00:54:39.841 --> 00:54:43.290
<v Speaker 2>and he said he's so talented but he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost too nice for fighting.</v>

1179
00:54:44.070 --> 00:54:44.903
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's true.</v>

1180
00:54:45.150 --> 00:54:49.260
<v Speaker 2>I think he's just needs more fights and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's got a big one with Anderson</v>

1181
00:54:49.260 --> 00:54:51.000
<v Speaker 2>Silva.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a big like crossroads fight.</v>

1182
00:54:51.001 --> 00:54:54.230
<v Speaker 2>It shows where Anderson's at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause if Anderson can get past Uriah,</v>

1183
00:54:54.300 --> 00:54:57.120
<v Speaker 2>who's one of the best 185 pounders alive</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

1184
00:54:57.121 --> 00:54:58.770
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is a lightening fast.</v>

1185
00:54:58.771 --> 00:55:02.400
<v Speaker 2>Reiker I'm picturing your riot and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>feels bigger than,</v>

1186
00:55:02.401 --> 00:55:03.490
<v Speaker 2>and this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1187
00:55:03.540 --> 00:55:06.420
<v Speaker 2>he's more muscular for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's built way better.</v>

1188
00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:08.370
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's probably faster,</v>

1189
00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:10.230
<v Speaker 2>which is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

1190
00:55:10.231 --> 00:55:12.060
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about Anderson Silva at 40</v>

1191
00:55:12.061 --> 00:55:14.490
<v Speaker 2>years old versus Anderson Silva at like</v>
<v Speaker 2>34.</v>

1192
00:55:15.180 --> 00:55:17.070
<v Speaker 2>But uriah is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1193
00:55:17.190 --> 00:55:20.430
<v Speaker 2>he's like got traditional martial arts</v>
<v Speaker 2>skills at a super,</v>

1194
00:55:20.431 --> 00:55:22.560
<v Speaker 2>super high level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he does a lot of stuff like</v>

1195
00:55:22.561 --> 00:55:26.790
<v Speaker 2>spinning back kicks and wheel kicks and</v>
<v Speaker 2>knocks guys out with them in real high</v>

1196
00:55:26.791 --> 00:55:29.250
<v Speaker 2>level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guys like he hit gay garden was saucy.</v>

1197
00:55:29.260 --> 00:55:32.850
<v Speaker 2>There's Uriah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he hit gay guy who saucy with a spinning</v>

1198
00:55:32.851 --> 00:55:34.170
<v Speaker 2>back kick to the face.</v>

1199
00:55:34.710 --> 00:55:37.200
<v Speaker 2>And it was a fight that we were calling</v>
<v Speaker 2>for fight companion.</v>

1200
00:55:37.230 --> 00:55:38.790
<v Speaker 2>And my thoughts on him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1201
00:55:38.850 --> 00:55:43.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you this guy can do things</v>
<v Speaker 2>in these explosive movements and I'm,</v>

1202
00:55:43.770 --> 00:55:47.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so used to seeing people move.</v>

1203
00:55:47.470 --> 00:55:49.860
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm so used to seeing the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way people throw kicks and the way</v>

1204
00:55:49.861 --> 00:55:52.680
<v Speaker 2>people throw punches when someone's</v>
<v Speaker 2>movements stand out,</v>

1205
00:55:52.681 --> 00:55:53.514
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

1206
00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:57.120
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they've got it honed down to uh,</v>

1207
00:55:57.470 --> 00:56:01.110
<v Speaker 2>a razor's edge with just lightening</v>
<v Speaker 2>precision.</v>

1208
00:56:01.230 --> 00:56:03.270
<v Speaker 2>It just really stands out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's your riot hall.</v>

1209
00:56:03.271 --> 00:56:05.740
<v Speaker 2>Uriah Hall has these movements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Occasionally we'll,</v>

1210
00:56:05.741 --> 00:56:07.710
<v Speaker 2>he'll just drop a right hand on</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone's channy.</v>

1211
00:56:07.711 --> 00:56:08.970
<v Speaker 2>You just go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

1212
00:56:09.450 --> 00:56:13.680
<v Speaker 2>There's like that guy was not moving</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that by the time that punch got to</v>

1213
00:56:13.681 --> 00:56:15.240
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he had no idea that punch was</v>

1214
00:56:15.241 --> 00:56:16.074
<v Speaker 2>coming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1215
00:56:16.110 --> 00:56:19.320
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his ability to close the distance with a</v>

1216
00:56:19.321 --> 00:56:21.150
<v Speaker 2>shot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so fucking scary.</v>

1217
00:56:22.290 --> 00:56:25.540
<v Speaker 2>So it's an interesting fight in that</v>
<v Speaker 2>regard and I don't think it has,</v>

1218
00:56:25.541 --> 00:56:29.120
<v Speaker 2>does it have their age there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are they hiring the age will be a</v>

1219
00:56:29.130 --> 00:56:32.770
<v Speaker 2>little girls kind of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that show your fucking age?</v>

1220
00:56:33.010 --> 00:56:33.780
<v Speaker 2>Well that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How,</v>

1221
00:56:33.780 --> 00:56:35.980
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would they have all these different</v>

1222
00:56:35.981 --> 00:56:37.570
<v Speaker 2>things?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was looking for height too.</v>

1223
00:56:37.900 --> 00:56:38.381
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1224
00:56:38.381 --> 00:56:41.020
<v Speaker 2>So this is one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the stats.</v>

1225
00:56:41.021 --> 00:56:43.780
<v Speaker 2>They have the reach and they have the</v>
<v Speaker 2>weight and then they have the height.</v>

1226
00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:49.180
<v Speaker 2>I was always amazed how Anderson Silva's</v>
<v Speaker 2>body does not match his record.</v>

1227
00:56:49.860 --> 00:56:52.000
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Anderson Silva when he was in his</v>

1228
00:56:52.001 --> 00:56:53.980
<v Speaker 2>prime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>looked a little bit better than that,</v>

1229
00:56:54.550 --> 00:56:55.570
<v Speaker 2>but he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1230
00:56:55.630 --> 00:56:59.710
<v Speaker 2>his body is a really good body for</v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting because in fighting,</v>

1231
00:57:00.340 --> 00:57:05.340
<v Speaker 2>like say a guy like uriah hall might be</v>
<v Speaker 2>able to punch 10 or 15% harder than</v>

1232
00:57:06.281 --> 00:57:07.210
<v Speaker 2>Anderson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like who knows?</v>

1233
00:57:07.330 --> 00:57:09.070
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he hits really fucking hard,</v>

1234
00:57:09.100 --> 00:57:11.980
<v Speaker 2>let's say Ken,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if Anderson hits him,</v>

1235
00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:17.110
<v Speaker 2>the 90% that Anderson can come up with</v>
<v Speaker 2>is just as good.</v>

1236
00:57:17.990 --> 00:57:22.150
<v Speaker 2>The clean shots are the most important</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing and it doesn't take like a giant</v>

1237
00:57:22.151 --> 00:57:23.880
<v Speaker 2>bomb to knock you out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1238
00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:27.580
<v Speaker 2>A giant bomb can knock you out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't take a giant bomb to</v>

1239
00:57:27.581 --> 00:57:29.590
<v Speaker 2>knock you out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What it takes is a shot you don't see</v>

1240
00:57:29.591 --> 00:57:34.591
<v Speaker 2>common and a perfectly placed shot and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anderson is the master at perfectly play</v>

1241
00:57:35.511 --> 00:57:37.360
<v Speaker 2>shots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's the master.</v>

1242
00:57:37.361 --> 00:57:40.600
<v Speaker 2>He's the ultimate sniper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Out of all the guys that have ever</v>

1243
00:57:40.601 --> 00:57:43.450
<v Speaker 2>fought in the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he impresses me the most with his</v>

1244
00:57:43.451 --> 00:57:48.070
<v Speaker 2>ability to land these highlight reel</v>
<v Speaker 2>shots on people.</v>

1245
00:57:48.110 --> 00:57:52.600
<v Speaker 2>Highlight reel with James Irvin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He caught James Irvin's kick and just</v>

1246
00:57:52.601 --> 00:57:56.860
<v Speaker 2>caved his face in with a punch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy threw a kick anish and caught it</v>

1247
00:57:56.861 --> 00:58:00.550
<v Speaker 2>and bub boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can see the dude had never been here</v>

1248
00:58:00.551 --> 00:58:03.010
<v Speaker 2>like that before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes down and Anderson just uncorked</v>

1249
00:58:03.011 --> 00:58:03.870
<v Speaker 2>a couple more on them.</v>

1250
00:58:03.870 --> 00:58:06.370
<v Speaker 2>It opens him up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When he fought vetoer,</v>

1251
00:58:06.371 --> 00:58:10.410
<v Speaker 2>he front kicked Vitorin the face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like the perfect front kick knock</v>

1252
00:58:10.411 --> 00:58:14.530
<v Speaker 2>out and it was the first ever front kick</v>
<v Speaker 2>knock out in the,</v>

1253
00:58:14.531 --> 00:58:17.080
<v Speaker 2>in the history of the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody had ever done it before and he</v>

1254
00:58:17.081 --> 00:58:20.680
<v Speaker 2>did it in a high level world</v>
<v Speaker 2>championship fight against Vitor</v>

1255
00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:21.980
<v Speaker 2>Belfort.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy because it's,</v>

1256
00:58:22.180 --> 00:58:24.880
<v Speaker 2>it's the first kick you learn in martial</v>
<v Speaker 2>arts.</v>

1257
00:58:25.180 --> 00:58:27.640
<v Speaker 2>It's like the first kick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you learn how to do a front kick and</v>

1258
00:58:27.641 --> 00:58:29.470
<v Speaker 2>nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody goes at that shit doesn't</v>

1259
00:58:29.471 --> 00:58:31.190
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to go with the Brown house.</v>

1260
00:58:32.140 --> 00:58:35.540
<v Speaker 2>Anderson lands it right on his face and</v>
<v Speaker 2>this one's a free ass dude.</v>

1261
00:58:36.140 --> 00:58:37.450
<v Speaker 2>You think he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is he back?</v>

1262
00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:41.570
<v Speaker 2>He's 40.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So whatever back is,</v>

1263
00:58:41.640 --> 00:58:44.050
<v Speaker 2>he's not going to be the same back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1264
00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:46.720
<v Speaker 2>but if you look at a guy like Bernard</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hopkins,</v>

1265
00:58:46.840 --> 00:58:50.140
<v Speaker 2>Bernard Hopkins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's an incredibly skillful technical</v>

1266
00:58:50.141 --> 00:58:53.410
<v Speaker 2>boxer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's still at this day.</v>

1267
00:58:53.410 --> 00:58:55.360
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a video of him working out</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other day.</v>

1268
00:58:55.361 --> 00:58:57.760
<v Speaker 2>He was hitting mitts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He looks fucking great.</v>

1269
00:58:57.761 --> 00:58:59.890
<v Speaker 2>He's 50 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He looks fucking great.</v>

1270
00:59:00.130 --> 00:59:03.880
<v Speaker 2>Like Bernard Hopkins Right now at 50</v>
<v Speaker 2>years old could get in the ring and</v>

1271
00:59:03.881 --> 00:59:07.780
<v Speaker 2>school solid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>50% of the professional light</v>

1272
00:59:07.781 --> 00:59:10.330
<v Speaker 2>heavyweights in the world would look</v>
<v Speaker 2>ugly.</v>

1273
00:59:11.260 --> 00:59:13.030
<v Speaker 2>Gold them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You hold the shit out of you,</v>

1274
00:59:13.060 --> 00:59:16.000
<v Speaker 2>hold the Shit Out of you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jab your fucking face off.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>moving weird ways up or you know,</v>

1276
00:59:18.730 --> 00:59:21.920
<v Speaker 2>step on your toes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>upset your balance Mug and the corner.</v>

1277
00:59:21.921 --> 00:59:23.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hit you with like short,</v>

1278
00:59:23.390 --> 00:59:25.400
<v Speaker 2>short,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hard punches while he's clenching you,</v>

1279
00:59:25.910 --> 00:59:30.890
<v Speaker 2>annoy you and getting your head get you</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of your game or a bomb you out.</v>

1280
00:59:30.891 --> 00:59:33.000
<v Speaker 2>Like he did Felix Trinidad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Philly's trend.</v>

1281
00:59:33.001 --> 00:59:35.330
<v Speaker 2>Dad Fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He put on a show with Felix Trinidad.</v>

1282
00:59:35.390 --> 00:59:39.380
<v Speaker 2>I was always a big Bernard Hopkins Fan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when he fought Trinidad and fucked</v>

1283
00:59:39.381 --> 00:59:41.330
<v Speaker 2>him up for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like I knew it.</v>

1284
00:59:41.390 --> 00:59:44.030
<v Speaker 2>I was surprised.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought the Felix was the truth,</v>

1285
00:59:44.060 --> 00:59:46.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while he was for a moment.</v>

1286
00:59:46.300 --> 00:59:49.910
<v Speaker 2>But I don't think he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say,</v>

1287
00:59:49.970 --> 00:59:53.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he respected Bernard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he knew how good Bernard</v>

1288
00:59:53.901 --> 00:59:56.360
<v Speaker 2>really was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he was doing so well and</v>

1289
00:59:56.361 --> 00:59:59.420
<v Speaker 2>Trinidad was such a world beater and</v>
<v Speaker 2>just such a tough dude.</v>

1290
00:59:59.840 --> 01:00:01.670
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he thought he could get through</v>

1291
01:00:01.671 --> 01:00:02.520
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

1292
01:00:02.521 --> 01:00:03.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was one of those guys that,</v>

1293
01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:04.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can,</v>

1294
01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:06.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get through everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody,</v>

1295
01:00:06.161 --> 01:00:07.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's been to war before he's been</v>

1296
01:00:07.731 --> 01:00:09.680
<v Speaker 2>tagged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come about knock guys out.</v>

1297
01:00:10.220 --> 01:00:13.310
<v Speaker 2>But Bernard was on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on nother level that night.</v>

1298
01:00:13.330 --> 01:00:15.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen anybody like Bernard</v>

1299
01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:20.200
<v Speaker 2>cause so it's not traditional boxing</v>
<v Speaker 2>like somebody who does that.</v>

1300
01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:23.210
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't get as far as him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1301
01:00:23.270 --> 01:00:25.370
<v Speaker 2>Like I've never seen somebody and do it</v>
<v Speaker 2>that much.</v>

1302
01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:28.700
<v Speaker 2>Well he's a master.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a real master.</v>

1303
01:00:28.770 --> 01:00:33.290
<v Speaker 2>If you watch his footwork and in the in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ring it's always measured.</v>

1304
01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:36.350
<v Speaker 2>It's always under control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He always knows exactly what he's doing</v>

1305
01:00:36.351 --> 01:00:37.970
<v Speaker 2>and what he doesn't know exactly what</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's doing.</v>

1306
01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:40.610
<v Speaker 2>He resets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not whinging anything.</v>

1307
01:00:40.611 --> 01:00:44.690
<v Speaker 2>He's not taking any stupid chances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was that dead dude he beat for the</v>

1308
01:00:44.691 --> 01:00:48.290
<v Speaker 2>title at 49 years of age was his fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>young stud.</v>

1309
01:00:48.710 --> 01:00:51.320
<v Speaker 2>This guy was like 32 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some Russian dude,</v>

1310
01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:53.870
<v Speaker 2>bad motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he dropped him.</v>

1311
01:00:53.930 --> 01:00:58.460
<v Speaker 2>Bernard dropped him at 49 years of age</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people like God and then he fought</v>

1312
01:00:58.461 --> 01:01:01.220
<v Speaker 2>Kovalev and that was the fight that</v>
<v Speaker 2>showed.</v>

1313
01:01:01.221 --> 01:01:04.970
<v Speaker 2>There's a difference between the highest</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the high level right now.</v>

1314
01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.000
<v Speaker 2>And we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bernard is right now with his life being</v>

1315
01:01:08.001 --> 01:01:10.970
<v Speaker 2>49 years old cause Coleville that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>just too much for him.</v>

1316
01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:14.900
<v Speaker 2>And Bernard went into a shell and just</v>
<v Speaker 2>fought real defensively and tried to</v>

1317
01:01:14.901 --> 01:01:16.910
<v Speaker 2>survive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Kovalev was opening up on him.</v>

1318
01:01:16.910 --> 01:01:19.910
<v Speaker 2>Kovalev it's fucking scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy's the real deal.</v>

1319
01:01:20.950 --> 01:01:23.660
<v Speaker 2>It's not a bad ass fucking Russians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's days.</v>

1320
01:01:23.870 --> 01:01:26.960
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It must be tougher than rush her.</v>

1321
01:01:26.961 --> 01:01:28.340
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got to be tough.</v>

1322
01:01:28.490 --> 01:01:32.030
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be tough on Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They getting all the boxes like this is</v>

1323
01:01:32.031 --> 01:01:34.490
<v Speaker 2>like the sport where like a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>sports,</v>

1324
01:01:34.491 --> 01:01:37.370
<v Speaker 2>a lot of poor people come out and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>get to the top of it.</v>

1325
01:01:38.060 --> 01:01:42.020
<v Speaker 2>You could tell where poor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the poorest people are based on</v>

1326
01:01:42.021 --> 01:01:46.730
<v Speaker 2>who's the best boxers in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Russia must be rough right now.</v>

1327
01:01:46.970 --> 01:01:48.430
<v Speaker 2>That's a real good point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1328
01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:50.090
<v Speaker 2>That's how it always worked in America</v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

1329
01:01:50.570 --> 01:01:55.070
<v Speaker 2>It's like that's why Jews were a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>boxers in the early days of the early</v>

1330
01:01:55.071 --> 01:01:58.880
<v Speaker 2>part of the 12th century when Jewish</v>
<v Speaker 2>slappy Maxie Rosenbloom.</v>

1331
01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:04.600
<v Speaker 2>I was a dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could not have that as a box name</v>

1332
01:02:04.611 --> 01:02:06.680
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could be silly.</v>

1333
01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:08.540
<v Speaker 2>It's silly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but nobody would take you serious.</v>

1334
01:02:08.541 --> 01:02:11.720
<v Speaker 2>Slappy maxims.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the top featherweight in the UFC.</v>

1335
01:02:11.721 --> 01:02:12.830
<v Speaker 2>Andre Fili,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>

1336
01:02:12.930 --> 01:02:15.060
<v Speaker 2>his nickname,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his Andre Touchy feely and</v>

1337
01:02:18.300 --> 01:02:20.100
<v Speaker 2>he's a fucking weird ass name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's</v>

1338
01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:21.360
<v Speaker 1>a fun dude though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a fun,</v>

1340
01:02:23.250 --> 01:02:24.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

1341
01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:25.351
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1342
01:02:25.351 --> 01:02:26.070
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1343
01:02:26.070 --> 01:02:28.320
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting how that APP works that</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

1344
01:02:28.350 --> 01:02:29.580
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it was the Italians.</v>

1345
01:02:29.581 --> 01:02:31.770
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of Italians like rocky</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marciano,</v>

1346
01:02:31.771 --> 01:02:33.420
<v Speaker 1>rocky Graziano.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of,</v>

1347
01:02:33.870 --> 01:02:35.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm from Irish.</v>

1348
01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:36.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1349
01:02:36.750 --> 01:02:38.310
<v Speaker 1>A lot of Irish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of immigrants.</v>

1350
01:02:38.311 --> 01:02:41.820
<v Speaker 1>It's immigrants that are poor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People that need to learn how to fight</v>

1351
01:02:41.821 --> 01:02:44.310
<v Speaker 1>to survive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Literally fight to survive.</v>

1352
01:02:44.340 --> 01:02:45.750
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the reasons why these</v>

1353
01:02:45.751 --> 01:02:47.640
<v Speaker 1>Russians are so fucking tough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1354
01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.700
<v Speaker 1>They're coming from a harder place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a harder world.</v>

1355
01:02:51.060 --> 01:02:53.650
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just like Coleville Lev is a</v>

1356
01:02:53.651 --> 01:02:56.550
<v Speaker 1>straight up killer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's seated in his eyes when he's in the</v>

1357
01:02:56.551 --> 01:02:57.900
<v Speaker 1>rankings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scared as shit.</v>

1358
01:02:58.050 --> 01:02:59.940
<v Speaker 1>He's just gonna fuck you up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1359
01:03:01.670 --> 01:03:03.840
<v Speaker 1>And then the Gennady Golovkin he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>another one.</v>

1360
01:03:04.110 --> 01:03:06.780
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's scared of that fucking what</v>
<v Speaker 1>the what weight class?</v>

1361
01:03:06.780 --> 01:03:08.400
<v Speaker 1>I haven't watched boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's won 60.</v>

1362
01:03:08.550 --> 01:03:10.920
<v Speaker 1>I used to be my thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's a middleweight champ.</v>

1363
01:03:11.070 --> 01:03:14.730
<v Speaker 1>He fucks everybody up and everybody sees</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hundred percent undefeated and he's</v>

1364
01:03:14.731 --> 01:03:17.160
<v Speaker 1>knocked everyone out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he had one fight,</v>

1365
01:03:17.161 --> 01:03:19.530
<v Speaker 1>the one the distance or a couple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe a couple of fights and went the</v>

1366
01:03:19.531 --> 01:03:22.020
<v Speaker 1>distance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's on some ridiculous knockout</v>

1367
01:03:22.021 --> 01:03:24.510
<v Speaker 1>streak in a row.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should know that for short.</v>

1368
01:03:24.511 --> 01:03:26.730
<v Speaker 1>Pull that up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gennady Golovkin triple g,</v>

1369
01:03:27.090 --> 01:03:29.460
<v Speaker 1>just a triple g record.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just impressed.</v>

1370
01:03:29.461 --> 01:03:33.600
<v Speaker 1>You can say his name so smoothly while</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got a second name that I can't,</v>

1371
01:03:33.630 --> 01:03:35.820
<v Speaker 1>if there's a triple g,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's [inaudible] something,</v>

1372
01:03:35.821 --> 01:03:38.340
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

1425
01:06:00.430 --> 01:06:03.670
<v Speaker 2>probably a direct descendant of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mongols.</v>

1426

<v Speaker 2>There was so many fucking super</v>
<v Speaker 2>warriors.</v>

01:06:11.531 --> 01:06:11.890

1430
01:06:15.851 --> 01:06:18.340
<v Speaker 2>DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1431
01:06:18.341 --> 01:06:21.700
<v Speaker 2>to look at him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at his face and the way he fights.</v>

1432
01:06:21.790 --> 01:06:25.690
<v Speaker 2>You got to hit that dude with a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>crowbar to hurt him.</v>

1433
01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:31.110
<v Speaker 2>He engages in wars with these people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to get back into boxing that Lucas</v>

1434
01:06:31.130 --> 01:06:33.920
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] fight was insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Providing the coughing.</v>

1435
01:06:33.930 --> 01:06:37.120
<v Speaker 2>My Tsa just teed off on each other and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just,</v>

1436
01:06:37.590 --> 01:06:41.410
<v Speaker 2>TSA is a brutal knockout puncher and</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he was hitting,</v>

1437
01:06:41.890 --> 01:06:43.000
<v Speaker 2>providing a cough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were like,</v>

1438
01:06:43.001 --> 01:06:48.001
<v Speaker 2>how was he absorbing these shots?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's absorbed shots at Matisa was able</v>

1439
01:06:48.161 --> 01:06:50.410
<v Speaker 2>to put everybody else away with like</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at that shot.</v>

1440
01:06:50.770 --> 01:06:52.930
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Matissa like it's a weird,</v>

1441
01:06:52.931 --> 01:06:55.660
<v Speaker 2>like you look at the guy and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1442
01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:58.840
<v Speaker 2>obviously it looks like he's in shape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He looks athletic but he doesn't look</v>

1443
01:06:58.841 --> 01:07:00.430
<v Speaker 2>like a big power puncher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1444
01:07:01.390 --> 01:07:02.710
<v Speaker 2>Like if you look at him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not like,</v>

1445
01:07:02.980 --> 01:07:05.950
<v Speaker 2>he's not built like Marvin Hagler,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mike Tyson or something like that.</v>

1446
01:07:06.190 --> 01:07:08.930
<v Speaker 2>He's a more smooth and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1447
01:07:08.950 --> 01:07:13.150
<v Speaker 2>it just shows you that punching power is</v>
<v Speaker 2>a really weird thing.</v>

1448
01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:16.630
<v Speaker 2>And it's not saying that Matisa is in</v>
<v Speaker 2>any way unfit.</v>

1449
01:07:16.631 --> 01:07:18.010
<v Speaker 2>He's very fit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very strong,</v>

1450
01:07:18.011 --> 01:07:21.610
<v Speaker 2>very good athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But his punching power is almost just</v>

1451
01:07:21.611 --> 01:07:25.060
<v Speaker 2>like skeletal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It like comes from his frame.</v>

1452
01:07:25.061 --> 01:07:26.740
<v Speaker 2>And some sort of a strange way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is,</v>

1453
01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:28.510
<v Speaker 2>there's a bunch of guys that are like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1454
01:07:29.290 --> 01:07:30.280
<v Speaker 2>This is kidney,</v>
<v Speaker 2>UFC,</v>

1455
01:07:30.281 --> 01:07:34.510
<v Speaker 2>his name's Mike MacDonald and he's like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that like go to Mike McDonald.</v>

1456
01:07:34.660 --> 01:07:38.260
<v Speaker 2>This kid is a murderous puncher,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you look at him,</v>

1457
01:07:38.510 --> 01:07:39.490
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look,</v>

1458
01:07:39.550 --> 01:07:42.790
<v Speaker 2>he looks like a no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a regular kid,</v>

1459
01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:46.630
<v Speaker 2>like a regular like athlete and some</v>
<v Speaker 2>people you expect them,</v>

1460
01:07:46.631 --> 01:07:47.800
<v Speaker 2>when you look at them body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

1461
01:07:47.860 --> 01:07:49.420
<v Speaker 2>this person is probably going to hit</v>
<v Speaker 2>hard.</v>

1462
01:07:49.450 --> 01:07:52.240
<v Speaker 2>This kid and I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a sweet face,</v>

1463
01:07:53.950 --> 01:07:56.200
<v Speaker 2>goofy face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ziff he'd get a picture of his whole</v>

1464
01:07:56.201 --> 01:07:57.460
<v Speaker 2>body just standing there.</v>

1465
01:07:58.420 --> 01:08:02.680
<v Speaker 2>You'd get a sense of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it means obviously a good athlete,</v>

1466
01:08:03.130 --> 01:08:05.110
<v Speaker 2>but you're like right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was good example.</v>

1467
01:08:05.140 --> 01:08:08.560
<v Speaker 2>He's obviously get out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but his punching power is disturbing.</v>

1468
01:08:09.070 --> 01:08:11.170
<v Speaker 2>It's disturbing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lucky bloke,</v>

1469
01:08:11.290 --> 01:08:15.070
<v Speaker 2>he fucking cracks guys with shots and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see the look on their face and like,</v>

1470
01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:19.070
<v Speaker 2>what in the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is going on with this dude's hands?</v>

1471
01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:23.750
<v Speaker 2>He just hits so fucking hard and with so</v>
<v Speaker 2>much precision.</v>

1472
01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:26.630
<v Speaker 2>He's nasty on the ground too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a real threat.</v>

1473
01:08:26.631 --> 01:08:31.310
<v Speaker 2>This kid and he's super young.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's only like 23 yeah.</v>

1474
01:08:31.311 --> 01:08:34.250
<v Speaker 2>You already fought for the title.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He lost a brow and a crazy fight.</v>

1475
01:08:34.430 --> 01:08:37.190
<v Speaker 2>But a fight where it really got here</v>
<v Speaker 2>really got tested,</v>

1476
01:08:37.380 --> 01:08:41.110
<v Speaker 2>really showed what he's capable of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the body thing,</v>

1477
01:08:41.111 --> 01:08:43.250
<v Speaker 2>it's very strange,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it makes a person,</v>

1478
01:08:43.310 --> 01:08:44.310
<v Speaker 2>you never know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1479
01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:47.960
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like punching power is different than</v>

1480
01:08:47.961 --> 01:08:49.940
<v Speaker 2>almost any other kind of athletic power.</v>

1481
01:08:50.450 --> 01:08:53.750
<v Speaker 2>Like you don't see it coming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you see someone who has a big</v>

1482
01:08:53.751 --> 01:08:57.050
<v Speaker 2>ass and fucking giant quads and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>were on the starting block,</v>

1483
01:08:57.051 --> 01:08:59.330
<v Speaker 2>like I bet that fucking dude can ride,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1484
01:08:59.540 --> 01:09:02.960
<v Speaker 2>But you see a guy like Mcdonald's and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't necessarily go,</v>

1485
01:09:02.961 --> 01:09:07.890
<v Speaker 2>I bet that guy can fucking punch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where's Uriah hall that both murderers</v>

1486
01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:08.870
<v Speaker 2>punches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you're right hall,</v>

1487
01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:11.380
<v Speaker 2>you see it and you let go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously that guy can punch.</v>

1488
01:09:11.390 --> 01:09:13.220
<v Speaker 2>Look at him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd be most surprised if he couldn't.</v>

1489
01:09:13.370 --> 01:09:15.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there are guys like that too,</v>

1490
01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:17.810
<v Speaker 2>which is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's posters you'll be able to,</v>

1491
01:09:18.250 --> 01:09:19.070
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1492
01:09:19.070 --> 01:09:21.150
<v Speaker 2>It's like seeing a seven foot center,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1493
01:09:21.490 --> 01:09:24.200
<v Speaker 2>like nobody like daisy sanders in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>NBA.</v>

1494
01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:25.390
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1495
01:09:25.390 --> 01:09:27.730
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's seven feet and they sucked from the</v>

1496
01:09:27.731 --> 01:09:30.820
<v Speaker 4>data with drafted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But every team year after year,</v>

1497
01:09:30.821 --> 01:09:32.860
<v Speaker 4>we'll still put them on the team because</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's seven feet.</v>

1498
01:09:32.890 --> 01:09:37.090
<v Speaker 4>Maybe this is the year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>12 years in when he's going to do the</v>

1499
01:09:37.091 --> 01:09:37.440
<v Speaker 4>seventh</v>

1500
01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:41.330
<v Speaker 2>foot ship and he'd never do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they make all this money because</v>

1501
01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:44.160
<v Speaker 2>they built like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They should be able to do seven foot</v>

1502
01:09:44.161 --> 01:09:45.970
<v Speaker 2>shit or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or people are built like there's</v>

1503
01:09:45.971 --> 01:09:47.610
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be able to hit and they just</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't.</v>

1504
01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:49.860
<v Speaker 2>So do they get a guy like that and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

1505
01:09:49.890 --> 01:09:50.520
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're gonna,</v>

1506
01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:53.270
<v Speaker 2>we're gonna take him in and then we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to get our coaches on him.</v>

1507
01:09:53.300 --> 01:09:55.650
<v Speaker 2>We're going to show this guy had reached</v>
<v Speaker 2>its full potential.</v>

1508
01:09:55.890 --> 01:09:58.270
<v Speaker 2>And then they just don't through the</v>
<v Speaker 2>season and say,</v>

1509
01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:00.180
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see why the other train teams dropped</v>

1510
01:10:00.181 --> 01:10:03.740
<v Speaker 2>him and we stuck putting on the bench.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get stuck with him on the bench.</v>

1511
01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:06.390
<v Speaker 2>We're bringing me once in a while with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy that big.</v>

1512
01:10:06.391 --> 01:10:08.400
<v Speaker 2>Is it just difficult to move their body?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1513
01:10:09.490 --> 01:10:12.430
<v Speaker 4>They say that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like Shaq did it.</v>

1514
01:10:12.610 --> 01:10:15.880
<v Speaker 4>Shaq was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his movement was amazing.</v>

1515
01:10:16.090 --> 01:10:21.090
<v Speaker 4>Like almost small forward like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1516
01:10:21.340 --> 01:10:25.810
<v Speaker 4>some of the shit that he used to do and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I came along Jeewan moved well and uh,</v>

1517
01:10:26.230 --> 01:10:28.300
<v Speaker 4>they was Robinson movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well there was a lot of,</v>

1518
01:10:28.330 --> 01:10:29.360
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was some,</v>

1519
01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:30.670
<v Speaker 4>there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's some,</v>

1520
01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:32.073
<v Speaker 4>some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1521
01:10:32.230 --> 01:10:33.130
<v Speaker 4>some tea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1522
01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:34.870
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

1523
01:10:34.870 --> 01:10:36.850
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of centers that could</v>

1524
01:10:36.851 --> 01:10:39.880
<v Speaker 4>move.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when they say it's tough to move your</v>

1525
01:10:39.881 --> 01:10:41.360
<v Speaker 4>body,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't get it.</v>

1526
01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:43.840
<v Speaker 4>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is rare.</v>

1527
01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:47.830
<v Speaker 4>Like good centers are rare.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I guess maybe it is,</v>

1528
01:10:47.831 --> 01:10:50.820
<v Speaker 4>but when you see the ones that do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it makes you wonder,</v>

1529
01:10:51.340 --> 01:10:53.730
<v Speaker 4>it makes you look down on the people</v>
<v Speaker 4>that can't like him.</v>

1530
01:10:53.740 --> 01:10:57.130
<v Speaker 4>I'm seven feet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm thinking I could do some stuff,</v>

1531
01:10:57.160 --> 01:10:59.620
<v Speaker 4>I could be decent enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there's some guys that are seven</v>

1532
01:10:59.621 --> 01:11:03.340
<v Speaker 4>feet and they really don't do anything</v>
<v Speaker 4>except be seven feet.</v>

1533
01:11:04.770 --> 01:11:07.680
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now is it a benefit just having the big</v>

1534
01:11:07.681 --> 01:11:11.430
<v Speaker 2>guy there because they can do things and</v>
<v Speaker 2>block people and get in the way and make</v>

1535
01:11:11.431 --> 01:11:14.310
<v Speaker 2>it difficult for the other team to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to use their offense?</v>

1536
01:11:14.390 --> 01:11:14.791
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1537
01:11:14.791 --> 01:11:17.060
<v Speaker 4>it's a mentality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like they always say you can't</v>

1538
01:11:17.061 --> 01:11:18.350
<v Speaker 4>teach height.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

1539
01:11:18.860 --> 01:11:21.440
<v Speaker 4>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then it was like the eighties and</v>

1540
01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:25.730
<v Speaker 4>the nineties was like the center game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So everybody just felt more secure with</v>

1541
01:11:25.731 --> 01:11:26.690
<v Speaker 4>a center,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1542
01:11:26.770 --> 01:11:28.870
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they would plan their strategy around</v>

1543
01:11:28.871 --> 01:11:29.830
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tall guy,</v>

1544
01:11:29.950 --> 01:11:30.761
<v Speaker 2>the tall guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1545
01:11:30.761 --> 01:11:32.890
<v Speaker 2>Because he couldn't get the ball above</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1546
01:11:32.891 --> 01:11:35.680
<v Speaker 2>He has more like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially the way that they're throwing</v>

1547
01:11:35.681 --> 01:11:38.800
<v Speaker 2>the ball down at people instead of like</v>
<v Speaker 2>up and down.</v>

1548
01:11:38.801 --> 01:11:41.020
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could probably do some stuff as far</v>

1549
01:11:41.021 --> 01:11:44.280
<v Speaker 2>as I get in the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get his physical body to block people,</v>

1550
01:11:44.620 --> 01:11:46.300
<v Speaker 4>but sometimes they're not even good</v>
<v Speaker 4>enough to do that.</v>

1551
01:11:46.301 --> 01:11:48.280
<v Speaker 4>And then they have to get rid of her for</v>
<v Speaker 4>real.</v>

1552
01:11:48.500 --> 01:11:51.160
<v Speaker 4>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's get this guy.</v>

1553
01:11:51.580 --> 01:11:54.970
<v Speaker 4>He'll do the least and then they don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>even do the least.</v>

1554
01:11:55.540 --> 01:11:55.990
<v Speaker 4>Do you think</v>

1555
01:11:55.990 --> 01:11:58.280
<v Speaker 2>that's because they're lazy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1556
01:11:58.690 --> 01:12:01.000
<v Speaker 2>because it was always easy for them</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause they were always so big.</v>

1557
01:12:01.180 --> 01:12:03.280
<v Speaker 2>And so like as throughout their career</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were,</v>

1558
01:12:03.281 --> 01:12:04.390
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they always had a giant height</v>

1559
01:12:04.391 --> 01:12:05.090
<v Speaker 2>advantage.</v>

1560
01:12:05.090 --> 01:12:09.620
<v Speaker 4>Being transgender.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you're five foot four person born</v>

1561
01:12:09.621 --> 01:12:12.380
<v Speaker 4>in the 74 person's body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1562
01:12:13.190 --> 01:12:16.040
<v Speaker 4>Like like you're not supposed to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

1563
01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:17.570
<v Speaker 4>He's supposed to be doing something</v>
<v Speaker 4>else.</v>

1564
01:12:17.930 --> 01:12:20.540
<v Speaker 4>It just got stuck with this basketball</v>
<v Speaker 4>frame.</v>

1565
01:12:21.020 --> 01:12:22.310
<v Speaker 4>Like some people just can't do it.</v>

1566
01:12:22.630 --> 01:12:26.350
<v Speaker 2>So some people they got stuck with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>basketball frame but they don't have a</v>

1567
01:12:26.351 --> 01:12:28.780
<v Speaker 2>basketball mind or heart or heart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1568
01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:32.560
<v Speaker 2>you have to like want to move your body</v>
<v Speaker 2>in very difficult ways.</v>

1569
01:12:32.561 --> 01:12:34.270
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I want have met like one of the</v>

1570
01:12:34.271 --> 01:12:36.490
<v Speaker 2>things that you notice about fighters in</v>
<v Speaker 2>particular,</v>

1571
01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:39.280
<v Speaker 2>like um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you ever seen that guy a chocolate tito</v>

1572
01:12:39.281 --> 01:12:40.300
<v Speaker 2>fight?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1573
01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:44.080
<v Speaker 2>Self believes flyweight what way does he</v>
<v Speaker 2>champion?</v>

1574
01:12:44.110 --> 01:12:46.780
<v Speaker 2>I watched him fight the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Awesome boxer,</v>

1575
01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:50.530
<v Speaker 2>amazing counter fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so light and so small like mighty</v>

1576
01:12:50.531 --> 01:12:53.170
<v Speaker 2>mouse in the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably a better example because</v>

1577
01:12:53.171 --> 01:12:57.370
<v Speaker 2>mighty mouse fights at 125 pounds and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's the best in the world.</v>

1578
01:12:57.371 --> 01:13:00.160
<v Speaker 2>Like no one can fuck with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did Not just the best in the world at</v>

1579
01:13:00.161 --> 01:13:02.110
<v Speaker 2>one 25.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's the best in the world.</v>

1580
01:13:02.111 --> 01:13:03.760
<v Speaker 2>Hands down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no argument anymore.</v>

1581
01:13:03.761 --> 01:13:05.790
<v Speaker 2>After his last fight where he destroyed</v>
<v Speaker 2>Henry Hutto.</v>

1582
01:13:06.010 --> 01:13:07.770
<v Speaker 2>Everybody just lifts her hands up and</v>
<v Speaker 2>go.</v>

1583
01:13:07.780 --> 01:13:08.890
<v Speaker 2>He's the best,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's the best,</v>

1584
01:13:09.610 --> 01:13:14.040
<v Speaker 2>but he's 125 pounds and he way he moves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always wonder my cocoon,</v>

1585
01:13:14.050 --> 01:13:18.520
<v Speaker 2>a 200 pound guy move like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could it two 55 pound guy move like</v>

1586
01:13:18.521 --> 01:13:21.820
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it even possible like can we get like</v>

1587
01:13:21.821 --> 01:13:24.820
<v Speaker 2>when you look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the super athletes that are in the nfl</v>

1588
01:13:24.850 --> 01:13:27.640
<v Speaker 2>and I think we can all agree the most</v>
<v Speaker 2>explosive,</v>

1589
01:13:27.670 --> 01:13:29.740
<v Speaker 2>best athletes are in the NFL.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1590
01:13:29.770 --> 01:13:31.510
<v Speaker 2>Agreed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty close.</v>

1591
01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:35.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think there's probably some</v>
<v Speaker 2>really high level guys in mma at this</v>

1592
01:13:35.921 --> 01:13:38.650
<v Speaker 2>point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that overall the most</v>

1593
01:13:38.651 --> 01:13:40.690
<v Speaker 2>explosive high level athletes are in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1594
01:13:40.810 --> 01:13:44.500
<v Speaker 2>in the NFL.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you can get one of those nfl top</v>

1595
01:13:44.501 --> 01:13:47.470
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could you teach him to move like mighty</v>

1596
01:13:47.471 --> 01:13:51.400
<v Speaker 2>mouse if you started with him at a young</v>
<v Speaker 2>age or is it a gravity thing?</v>

1597
01:13:52.170 --> 01:13:56.500
<v Speaker 2>Is it that the 125 pound guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he can just do stuff with his joints and</v>

1598
01:13:56.501 --> 01:14:01.501
<v Speaker 2>his movement that the 260 pound guy just</v>
<v Speaker 2>physically his body can't keep up.</v>

1599
01:14:02.470 --> 01:14:04.110
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what the issue is.</v>

1600
01:14:04.140 --> 01:14:08.070
<v Speaker 4>It's like if you're little,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know your little from your little</v>

1601
01:14:08.580 --> 01:14:09.930
<v Speaker 4>from you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from your young person,</v>

1602
01:14:10.140 --> 01:14:12.610
<v Speaker 4>so you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you live little,</v>

1603
01:14:12.611 --> 01:14:15.130
<v Speaker 4>you move little right and you act</v>
<v Speaker 4>little.</v>

1604
01:14:15.250 --> 01:14:20.250
<v Speaker 4>If you're big then you know you're big</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there's certain things you just</v>

1605
01:14:21.101 --> 01:14:25.780
<v Speaker 4>don't gravitate to doing because it</v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't fit your size of your big.</v>

1606
01:14:25.781 --> 01:14:30.250
<v Speaker 4>So you see it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You almost have to convince hypnotize a</v>

1607
01:14:30.251 --> 01:14:35.251
<v Speaker 4>big dude that's your little and make</v>
<v Speaker 4>them like live little move like a little</v>

1608
01:14:36.431 --> 01:14:38.620
<v Speaker 4>person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a little person like and get used</v>

1609
01:14:38.621 --> 01:14:41.170
<v Speaker 4>to it and then it becomes natural like</v>
<v Speaker 4>mighty mouse moves.</v>

1610
01:14:41.171 --> 01:14:43.030
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm little.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I,</v>

1611
01:14:43.031 --> 01:14:45.700
<v Speaker 4>if I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he fights like if he's fighting a bully</v>

1612
01:14:45.701 --> 01:14:48.670
<v Speaker 4>in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I can't let that guy grabbed me.</v>

1613
01:14:48.671 --> 01:14:52.550
<v Speaker 4>I got to keep moving like a big guys</v>
<v Speaker 4>like let this motherfucker grabbed me,</v>

1614
01:14:53.190 --> 01:14:55.270
<v Speaker 4>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want you to grab me.</v>

1615
01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:56.710
<v Speaker 4>So you fight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they fight big.</v>

1616
01:14:56.711 --> 01:14:57.700
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1617
01:14:57.780 --> 01:15:02.260
<v Speaker 4>it's just a mentality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's an excellent way of putting it.</v>

1618
01:15:02.350 --> 01:15:04.450
<v Speaker 4>That's an actual,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you're totally right.</v>

1619
01:15:04.780 --> 01:15:08.440
<v Speaker 4>I think you're totally right because we</v>
<v Speaker 4>all like do things according to just our</v>

1620
01:15:08.441 --> 01:15:09.590
<v Speaker 4>physical makeup,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1621
01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:10.473
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1622
01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:14.450
<v Speaker 2>But I wonder if you could get a guy at a</v>
<v Speaker 2>young age,</v>

1623
01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:17.810
<v Speaker 2>like do you know the story of marvel</v>
<v Speaker 2>renovation and Todd Marinovich,</v>

1624
01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:20.750
<v Speaker 2>todd Marinovich,</v>
<v Speaker 2>todd Marinovich who was a famous</v>

1625
01:15:20.751 --> 01:15:25.190
<v Speaker 2>football player and his dad marve was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>famous strength and conditioning coach</v>

1626
01:15:25.500 --> 01:15:26.630
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a coach,</v>

1627
01:15:26.660 --> 01:15:29.630
<v Speaker 2>a football coach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So his dad took todd from the time it</v>

1628
01:15:29.631 --> 01:15:32.720
<v Speaker 2>was really little.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a meeting only healthy food,</v>

1629
01:15:32.721 --> 01:15:34.670
<v Speaker 2>no sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>working out like crazy.</v>

1630
01:15:34.671 --> 01:15:38.390
<v Speaker 2>Put them through all the drills and</v>
<v Speaker 2>turned him into this like super athlete.</v>

1631
01:15:38.930 --> 01:15:41.810
<v Speaker 2>But he rebelled because it was just like</v>
<v Speaker 2>too much pressure and work.</v>

1632
01:15:41.820 --> 01:15:43.550
<v Speaker 2>They didn't want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's doing it for his dad?</v>

1633
01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:45.620
<v Speaker 2>Then he bounced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We want to quit any went drugs and</v>

1634
01:15:45.621 --> 01:15:46.490
<v Speaker 2>unhealthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1635
01:15:46.491 --> 01:15:49.190
<v Speaker 2>Drugs unhealthy became an artist or</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's healthy now,</v>

1636
01:15:49.191 --> 01:15:49.911
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hopefully.</v>

1637
01:15:49.911 --> 01:15:50.810
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's interesting.</v>

1638
01:15:50.811 --> 01:15:52.250
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an interesting thing.</v>

1639
01:15:52.250 --> 01:15:57.250
<v Speaker 2>Like this guy grabbed his young son from</v>
<v Speaker 2>the time he was a baby and had him doing</v>

1640
01:15:57.321 --> 01:16:02.210
<v Speaker 2>any strength drills and can coordination</v>
<v Speaker 2>drills like raised him with the idea of</v>

1641
01:16:02.211 --> 01:16:04.490
<v Speaker 2>turning them into this and the results</v>
<v Speaker 2>were amazing.</v>

1642
01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:08.610
<v Speaker 2>So you wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if someone could take a guy like a</v>

1643
01:16:08.660 --> 01:16:12.170
<v Speaker 2>Herschel Walker for Herschel Walker is</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the perfect example.</v>

1644
01:16:12.390 --> 01:16:14.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the best examples because</v>

1645
01:16:14.210 --> 01:16:17.930
<v Speaker 2>Herschel actually fought mma Herschel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he felt like a big man.</v>

1646
01:16:18.290 --> 01:16:21.410
<v Speaker 2>He fucked dudes up to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did it in his late forties.</v>

1647
01:16:21.890 --> 01:16:24.520
<v Speaker 2>He was legitimately a threat or good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1648
01:16:24.830 --> 01:16:28.550
<v Speaker 2>he was very good for the class that he</v>
<v Speaker 2>was fighting in,</v>

1649
01:16:28.580 --> 01:16:33.580
<v Speaker 2>but he was fairly recent to mma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but along a lifelong martial artists</v>

1650
01:16:34.401 --> 01:16:37.250
<v Speaker 2>like Hershel Walker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even back in the days when he was in the</v>

1651
01:16:37.251 --> 01:16:39.860
<v Speaker 2>NFL,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had some sort of a black belt in</v>

1652
01:16:39.861 --> 01:16:41.170
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You look at him,</v>

1653
01:16:41.171 --> 01:16:41.810
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1654
01:16:41.810 --> 01:16:45.210
<v Speaker 2>I think in that picture he was like 47.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

1655
01:16:45.211 --> 01:16:48.170
<v Speaker 2>Say he always looked young and gooden</v>
<v Speaker 2>and shaping.</v>

1656
01:16:48.260 --> 01:16:50.480
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1657
01:16:50.481 --> 01:16:55.481
<v Speaker 2>that shit doesn't even make any sense</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he looks like he's as big as he</v>

1658
01:16:55.881 --> 01:16:58.130
<v Speaker 2>was when he was playing professional</v>
<v Speaker 2>football.</v>

1659
01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:00.500
<v Speaker 2>Who lied to bear heads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1660
01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:02.710
<v Speaker 2>I'll kill you with my bare hands and</v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

1661
01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:04.520
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's on top of this dude ground and</v>

1662
01:17:04.521 --> 01:17:08.090
<v Speaker 2>pounded them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And on top of that he trained at a world</v>

1663
01:17:08.091 --> 01:17:13.091
<v Speaker 2>class gym and he went to Aka and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>trained in American kickboxing</v>

1664
01:17:13.281 --> 01:17:15.260
<v Speaker 2>association,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is where that's tyron woodley,</v>

1665
01:17:15.261 --> 01:17:16.720
<v Speaker 2>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't get racist.</v>

1666
01:17:16.770 --> 01:17:19.410
<v Speaker 2>Ami Dairy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just mixing up black man.</v>

1667
01:17:19.460 --> 01:17:20.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're mixing black people together.</v>

1668
01:17:22.180 --> 01:17:23.990
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dare you google.</v>

1669
01:17:24.740 --> 01:17:26.360
<v Speaker 2>It's Google.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not Jamie's Google,</v>

1670
01:17:26.361 --> 01:17:27.570
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Google's racists.</v>

1671
01:17:27.670 --> 01:17:30.020
<v Speaker 2>But Herschel Walker when he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1672
01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:33.950
<v Speaker 2>when he was training was training with</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cain Velasquez when Kane was the champ</v>

1673
01:17:34.950 --> 01:17:36.380
<v Speaker 2>or if it came,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't a champion,</v>

1674
01:17:36.381 --> 01:17:37.490
<v Speaker 2>was one of the best and world.</v>

1675
01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:39.800
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure he was a champ though.</v>

1676
01:17:40.250 --> 01:17:42.320
<v Speaker 2>And he was training with Daniel Cormier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe,</v>

1677
01:17:42.321 --> 01:17:44.660
<v Speaker 2>was it there at the time?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Luke rockhold.</v>

1678
01:17:44.990 --> 01:17:47.300
<v Speaker 2>Kyle Kingsbury.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's training with like,</v>

1679
01:17:47.450 --> 01:17:51.320
<v Speaker 2>John Fitch was there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's trained with like legit worldclass</v>

1680
01:17:51.410 --> 01:17:53.510
<v Speaker 2>mixed martial artists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>legit guys.</v>

1681
01:17:54.020 --> 01:17:59.020
<v Speaker 2>And he was just fucking doing it like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>real pro athlete would do it.</v>

1682
01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:01.490
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't doing it like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1683
01:18:01.491 --> 01:18:04.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm a celebrity former football player.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to kind of,</v>

1684
01:18:04.430 --> 01:18:06.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to take a fight like a Jose</v>
<v Speaker 2>can say call might.</v>

1685
01:18:06.500 --> 01:18:08.110
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you ever see,</v>

1686
01:18:08.120 --> 01:18:11.000
<v Speaker 2>I saw Jose psychos like celebrity boxing</v>
<v Speaker 2>matches and shit.</v>

1687
01:18:11.390 --> 01:18:12.081
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>

1688
01:18:12.081 --> 01:18:13.760
<v Speaker 2>It's like kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he kind of barely did.</v>

1689
01:18:13.940 --> 01:18:18.560
<v Speaker 2>Not Herschel Herschel like when at it</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a real professional martial artists</v>

1690
01:18:19.370 --> 01:18:21.650
<v Speaker 2>and strike force had him fight a few</v>
<v Speaker 2>times.</v>

1691
01:18:21.820 --> 01:18:24.300
<v Speaker 2>He did that Olympic bobsled stuff for</v>
<v Speaker 2>awhile to Africans.</v>

1692
01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:26.140
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just stays out too.</v>

1693
01:18:26.990 --> 01:18:30.060
<v Speaker 2>But he's an unbelievable athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1694
01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:34.070
<v Speaker 2>Like he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a rare Bo Jackson type athletes.</v>

1695
01:18:34.430 --> 01:18:37.190
<v Speaker 2>An outlier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>An outlier amongst professional</v>

1696
01:18:37.191 --> 01:18:38.024
<v Speaker 2>outliers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1697
01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:41.030
<v Speaker 2>So if you could take a Herschel Walker</v>
<v Speaker 2>and train him,</v>

1698
01:18:41.031 --> 01:18:45.050
<v Speaker 2>like get him to a guy like Matt Hume who</v>
<v Speaker 2>trained mighty mouse and train him from</v>

1699
01:18:45.051 --> 01:18:48.590
<v Speaker 2>the time he's a young man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 1514 years old.</v>

1700
01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:50.390
<v Speaker 2>Fuck yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he can do it.</v>

1701
01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:52.910
<v Speaker 2>He could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's him back in the day.</v>

1702
01:18:52.990 --> 01:18:54.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Handsome bastard.</v>

<v Speaker 2>strong gold chains getting bitches and</v>

1704
01:18:57.860 --> 01:19:01.610
<v Speaker 2>bitches shown scars off Google Vogue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard something like,</v>

1705
01:19:02.090 --> 01:19:06.400
<v Speaker 2>I forgot how much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many pushups he does a day or</v>

1706
01:19:06.460 --> 01:19:07.390
<v Speaker 2>something and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1707
01:19:07.391 --> 01:19:09.620
<v Speaker 2>something saying that he still does it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1708
01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:14.720
<v Speaker 2>Well I guess if you just keep doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know your body stays like that.</v>

1709
01:19:14.790 --> 01:19:17.330
<v Speaker 2>It just requires unbelievable</v>
<v Speaker 2>discipline.</v>

1710
01:19:18.820 --> 01:19:20.970
<v Speaker 2>Skip days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's also real weird man.</v>

1711
01:19:21.220 --> 01:19:25.580
<v Speaker 2>He has um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's called trauma induced multiple</v>

1712
01:19:25.581 --> 01:19:27.860
<v Speaker 2>personality disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

1713
01:19:27.890 --> 01:19:30.800
<v Speaker 2>Believe that's how he describes it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Trauma,</v>

1714
01:19:31.010 --> 01:19:33.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure they're mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They mean head trauma.</v>

1715
01:19:33.710 --> 01:19:38.710
<v Speaker 2>I think it's more like childhood trauma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm sure head trauma doesn't help.</v>

1716
01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:43.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because for sure there was some head</v>

1717
01:19:43.551 --> 01:19:44.181
<v Speaker 2>trauma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1718
01:19:44.181 --> 01:19:46.700
<v Speaker 2>he was one of the greatest football</v>
<v Speaker 2>players of all time.</v>

1719
01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:47.331
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1720
01:19:47.331 --> 01:19:48.200
<v Speaker 2>think about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1721
01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:50.720
<v Speaker 2>if you made a list,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not a football fan,</v>

1722
01:19:50.810 --> 01:19:54.920
<v Speaker 2>but if I know you and you never got</v>
<v Speaker 2>arrested and he never raped anybody,</v>

1723
01:19:54.950 --> 01:19:57.290
<v Speaker 2>he must be pretty fucking awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1724
01:19:57.350 --> 01:20:00.890
<v Speaker 2>Like if it wasn't some giant controversy</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you're involved in like a ray rice</v>

1725
01:20:00.891 --> 01:20:02.720
<v Speaker 2>type situation and the murderer or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

1726
01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:04.820
<v Speaker 2>If it wasn't that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I hear about you,</v>

1727
01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:08.190
<v Speaker 2>he was so good that the cowboys traded</v>
<v Speaker 2>him</v>

1728
01:20:08.490 --> 01:20:12.150
<v Speaker 4>for a completely new football team that</v>
<v Speaker 4>won three superbowls.</v>

1729
01:20:12.660 --> 01:20:15.950
<v Speaker 4>That's how good he was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's incredible.</v>

1730
01:20:15.951 --> 01:20:17.730
<v Speaker 4>It's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's incredible.</v>

1731
01:20:17.910 --> 01:20:20.370
<v Speaker 4>Like it was crazy when they were going</v>
<v Speaker 4>to trade horse or walk and it's like</v>

1732
01:20:20.371 --> 01:20:21.510
<v Speaker 4>you're going to treat it Herschel</v>
<v Speaker 4>Walker,</v>

1733
01:20:21.511 --> 01:20:25.110
<v Speaker 4>but they got a brand new team and a set</v>
<v Speaker 4>of young players that ended up being</v>

1734
01:20:25.140 --> 01:20:27.270
<v Speaker 4>like their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their franchise.</v>

1735
01:20:27.271 --> 01:20:28.140
<v Speaker 4>But he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1736
01:20:28.141 --> 01:20:30.420
<v Speaker 4>that's how good he was at.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Think you get all those players.</v>

1737
01:20:30.421 --> 01:20:31.830
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1738
01:20:31.831 --> 01:20:33.000
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's always,</v>

1739
01:20:33.060 --> 01:20:38.060
<v Speaker 4>to me as someone who analyzes athletics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's always so confusing and,</v>

1740
01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:42.280
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and interesting when I see someone who</v>

1741
01:20:42.281 --> 01:20:43.650
<v Speaker 4>is just so much better than everybody</v>
<v Speaker 4>else,</v>

1742
01:20:43.651 --> 01:20:45.960
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like how the fuck is he so much better?</v>

1743
01:20:45.961 --> 01:20:47.110
<v Speaker 4>Like what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1744
01:20:48.270 --> 01:20:49.860
<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a soccer thing.</v>

1745
01:20:49.861 --> 01:20:52.350
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to tell you to stop the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1746
01:20:53.510 --> 01:20:55.270
<v Speaker 4>so you have the NBA,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1747
01:20:55.290 --> 01:20:56.390
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's the,</v>

1748
01:20:56.710 --> 01:21:01.290
<v Speaker 4>that the NBA is the basketball league of</v>
<v Speaker 4>America and England,</v>

1749
01:21:01.710 --> 01:21:05.100
<v Speaker 4>the top league,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the soccer version of Mbas called the</v>

1750
01:21:05.101 --> 01:21:08.220
<v Speaker 4>premise ship,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right premiership premiere ship here.</v>

1751
01:21:08.760 --> 01:21:13.760
<v Speaker 4>So there's this team named Lester.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now the premiership works different than</v>

1752
01:21:13.771 --> 01:21:15.090
<v Speaker 4>the NBA,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the NBA,</v>

1753
01:21:16.170 --> 01:21:19.170
<v Speaker 4>all the teams stay the same every year</v>
<v Speaker 4>in soccer.</v>

1754
01:21:19.350 --> 01:21:21.420
<v Speaker 4>The bottom three tickets,</v>
<v Speaker 4>20 teams in the league,</v>

1755
01:21:21.421 --> 01:21:26.421
<v Speaker 4>and the bottom three would go down if</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'd go down to the league below at the</v>

1756
01:21:28.020 --> 01:21:30.630
<v Speaker 4>end of the year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you have those least amount of</v>

1757
01:21:30.631 --> 01:21:34.890
<v Speaker 4>points that the team three teams or at</v>
<v Speaker 4>least go down and there's a league below</v>

1758
01:21:34.950 --> 01:21:38.730
<v Speaker 4>where the teams that first finished</v>
<v Speaker 4>first,</v>

1759
01:21:38.731 --> 01:21:43.731
<v Speaker 4>second and third come up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's important because lester</v>

1760
01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:49.920
<v Speaker 4>is a team last year that almost got</v>
<v Speaker 4>relegated to the league below.</v>

1761
01:21:50.100 --> 01:21:52.740
<v Speaker 4>So they almost got relegated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like everybody's like this team</v>

1762
01:21:52.741 --> 01:21:55.110
<v Speaker 4>is going down to the lower division,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they,</v>

1763
01:21:55.590 --> 01:21:59.610
<v Speaker 4>they want to maybe five or six games in</v>
<v Speaker 4>a row towards the end of the season and</v>

1764
01:21:59.611 --> 01:22:00.300
<v Speaker 4>stayed up.</v>

1765
01:22:00.300 --> 01:22:03.300
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But they're on a low budget team.</v>

1766
01:22:03.630 --> 01:22:07.050
<v Speaker 4>They keep the same players and they had</v>
<v Speaker 4>to fire the coach for,</v>

1767
01:22:07.051 --> 01:22:10.680
<v Speaker 4>cause his son did something and they got</v>
<v Speaker 4>this other guy named cloudy or rainy</v>

1768
01:22:10.681 --> 01:22:13.240
<v Speaker 4>area,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an old Italian coach that used to coach</v>

1769
01:22:13.241 --> 01:22:15.780
<v Speaker 4>and England would want at the top teams</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he never won anything.</v>

1770
01:22:15.781 --> 01:22:19.590
<v Speaker 4>He only came second.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So then all year he's coaching Leicester</v>

1771
01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:20.730
<v Speaker 4>and they're winning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1772
01:22:20.730 --> 01:22:25.110
<v Speaker 4>they went in but at the beginning of</v>
<v Speaker 4>every soccer season you always the lower</v>

1773
01:22:25.111 --> 01:22:27.440
<v Speaker 4>teams always when a little,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then there's the,</v>

1774
01:22:27.570 --> 01:22:30.900
<v Speaker 4>the the championship like stages of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>season,</v>

1775
01:22:30.901 --> 01:22:32.830
<v Speaker 4>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the second part of season,</v>

1776
01:22:32.831 --> 01:22:37.430
<v Speaker 4>the third and like the final forthwith</v>
<v Speaker 4>team starts slipping or less.</v>

1777
01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:40.680
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't slip.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They start with all the players are</v>

1778
01:22:40.681 --> 01:22:45.681
<v Speaker 4>players from like cast off teams and</v>
<v Speaker 4>teams play is that no team ever wanted</v>

1779
01:22:46.741 --> 01:22:47.574
<v Speaker 4>to buy.</v>

1780
01:22:47.790 --> 01:22:52.080
<v Speaker 4>And then so then they get into like the</v>
<v Speaker 4>last seven,</v>

1781
01:22:52.081 --> 01:22:53.400
<v Speaker 4>eight games in a season.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's like,</v>

1782
01:22:53.470 --> 01:22:54.780
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're going to start losing.</v>

1783
01:22:54.781 --> 01:22:57.480
<v Speaker 4>And the team behind them spurs is going</v>
<v Speaker 4>to catch them.</v>

1784
01:22:57.930 --> 01:23:01.320
<v Speaker 4>But these motherfuckers like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

1785
01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:05.800
<v Speaker 4>they gel together in a style that I've</v>
<v Speaker 4>never before.</v>

1786
01:23:05.801 --> 01:23:08.590
<v Speaker 4>Like they're very defensive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1787
01:23:08.620 --> 01:23:10.330
<v Speaker 4>but they will,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll attack you really if they have</v>

1788
01:23:10.331 --> 01:23:13.180
<v Speaker 4>these two forwards.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you kick the ball out to them,</v>

1789
01:23:13.420 --> 01:23:16.420
<v Speaker 4>they're fast and then they'll score and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then they'll just shut the whole shit</v>

1790
01:23:16.421 --> 01:23:18.090
<v Speaker 4>down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you ain't going nowhere.</v>

1791
01:23:18.110 --> 01:23:20.830
<v Speaker 4>Don't matter who the fuck you are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You are not going nowhere.</v>

1792
01:23:21.130 --> 01:23:23.410
<v Speaker 4>And on Thursday,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1793
01:23:23.411 --> 01:23:26.170
<v Speaker 4>on Monday,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this team,</v>

1794
01:23:26.590 --> 01:23:28.960
<v Speaker 4>5,000 to one won the premiership.</v>

1795
01:23:29.130 --> 01:23:32.090
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>5,000 to one one.</v>

1796
01:23:32.091 --> 01:23:35.240
<v Speaker 1>The fucking killer shit is fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>

1797
01:23:35.630 --> 01:23:39.830
<v Speaker 1>All kinds of people had little bets that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they won like 50,000 on 10 bucks or 10</v>

1798
01:23:39.831 --> 01:23:44.360
<v Speaker 1>pounds or euro or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it costs bookmakers $15 million.</v>

1799
01:23:44.420 --> 01:23:47.510
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because like it's empowered.</v>

1800
01:23:47.540 --> 01:23:49.460
<v Speaker 1>It's like the most impossible sports</v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

1801
01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:51.050
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's incredible.</v>

1802
01:23:51.380 --> 01:23:52.940
<v Speaker 1>I love hearing shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you,</v>

1803
01:23:52.941 --> 01:23:55.340
<v Speaker 1>as you were talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started getting discouraged because it</v>

1804
01:23:55.341 --> 01:23:56.990
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno about the soccer project.</v>

1805
01:23:58.500 --> 01:24:01.700
<v Speaker 1>Soccer project seems like it's going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>cost me a lot of paying attention.</v>

1806
01:24:01.830 --> 01:24:03.080
<v Speaker 1>The top no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what you do.</v>

1807
01:24:03.081 --> 01:24:04.880
<v Speaker 1>Just just pick a team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1808
01:24:04.881 --> 01:24:09.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to hit you a good team to my</v>
<v Speaker 1>mentor sort of brought you into mma.</v>

1809
01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:11.260
<v Speaker 1>Do a bunch of fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1810
01:24:11.270 --> 01:24:13.760
<v Speaker 1>I want you to be my mentor and get me</v>
<v Speaker 1>into soccer.</v>

1811
01:24:13.770 --> 01:24:15.200
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause it seems like if I'm going to</v>

1812
01:24:15.201 --> 01:24:17.930
<v Speaker 1>follow some shit and you fall some shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole world follows,</v>

1813
01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:18.260
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1814
01:24:18.260 --> 01:24:22.700
<v Speaker 1>Like what is like everybody loves the</v>
<v Speaker 1>NFL in the United States and I'm sure</v>

1815
01:24:22.701 --> 01:24:25.450
<v Speaker 1>it's awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if I'm going to fall,</v>

1816
01:24:25.451 --> 01:24:28.250
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to try to follow soccer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to give it a shot right now.</v>

<v Speaker 1>There's black lives matter in soccer too</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's too many countries are</v>

1821

<v Speaker 1>they broadcast that shit,</v>

1825
01:24:52.850 --> 01:24:55.160
<v Speaker 1>they bring it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll bring it up and they all like</v>

1826
01:24:55.370 --> 01:24:58.850
<v Speaker 1>the ref was stopped the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes the players or stop the game,</v>

1827
01:24:58.851 --> 01:25:03.170
<v Speaker 1>they'll get those people out or they'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>ban that team and the next time they</v>

1828
01:25:03.171 --> 01:25:04.520
<v Speaker 1>have to play it like a real game.</v>

1829
01:25:04.550 --> 01:25:07.790
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine the Lakers playing San Antonio</v>

1830
01:25:07.790 --> 01:25:12.320
<v Speaker 1>Spurs in an empty stadium because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>was racist chance the last time the game</v>

1831
01:25:12.321 --> 01:25:14.810
<v Speaker 1>was played at the lake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they just say you have a black,</v>

1832
01:25:14.811 --> 01:25:18.060
<v Speaker 1>you have a blackout game where none of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fans can come was punished.</v>

1833
01:25:18.760 --> 01:25:20.090
<v Speaker 1>They do shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

1834
01:25:20.091 --> 01:25:22.520
<v Speaker 1>I liked that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked that idea.</v>

1835
01:25:22.550 --> 01:25:23.870
<v Speaker 1>Blackout game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1836
01:25:24.230 --> 01:25:25.220
<v Speaker 1>Fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then,</v>

1837
01:25:25.221 --> 01:25:26.150
<v Speaker 1>but then people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1838
01:25:26.180 --> 01:25:29.460
<v Speaker 1>made them black.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hope to gain like build up monkey shit.</v>

1839
01:25:30.770 --> 01:25:33.040
<v Speaker 1>Everybody doesn't learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1840
01:25:33.080 --> 01:25:35.390
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people that just want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to fucking flip over the board.</v>

1841
01:25:35.410 --> 01:25:36.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to actually play the</v>

1842
01:25:36.741 --> 01:25:39.290
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to flip over the board or get</v>

1843
01:25:39.291 --> 01:25:41.460
<v Speaker 1>some type of attention from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Liking it.</v>

1844
01:25:41.470 --> 01:25:42.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's like we were talking about</v>

1845
01:25:42.981 --> 01:25:46.010
<v Speaker 1>before with people don't feel like we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the same.</v>

1846
01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:49.010
<v Speaker 1>You feel like those people over there</v>
<v Speaker 1>playing that game,</v>

1847
01:25:49.310 --> 01:25:50.510
<v Speaker 1>those are just people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1848
01:25:50.850 --> 01:25:54.470
<v Speaker 1>it's their dream to do this and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>figured out how to do it.</v>

1849
01:25:54.830 --> 01:25:57.500
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't be angry at them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should be inspired.</v>

1850
01:25:57.920 --> 01:26:00.230
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have anything to do with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1851
01:26:00.231 --> 01:26:02.750
<v Speaker 1>like just being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't be a fucking asshole.</v>

1852
01:26:02.900 --> 01:26:04.100
<v Speaker 1>But people also get so</v>

1853
01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:06.980
<v Speaker 2>attached to one team versus the other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's another,</v>

1854
01:26:07.010 --> 01:26:08.690
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's another thing that giant problem</v>

1855
01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:10.160
<v Speaker 2>like sports cause it brings people</v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

1856
01:26:10.161 --> 01:26:13.100
<v Speaker 2>But then at that point it also separates</v>
<v Speaker 2>people too much.</v>

1857
01:26:13.220 --> 01:26:14.480
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People have,</v>

1858
01:26:14.630 --> 01:26:17.810
<v Speaker 2>there's riots regularly at games,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1859
01:26:17.870 --> 01:26:21.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you looked at all the games</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are played between teams all over</v>

1860
01:26:21.621 --> 01:26:23.300
<v Speaker 2>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have respect now.</v>

1861
01:26:23.301 --> 01:26:25.150
<v Speaker 2>They fight in the town.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1862
01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:29.510
<v Speaker 2>Outside the stadium and they throw</v>
<v Speaker 2>bottles and shit from the bars and all</v>

1863
01:26:29.511 --> 01:26:30.860
<v Speaker 2>that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or The town fountain.</v>

1864
01:26:31.670 --> 01:26:34.340
<v Speaker 2>They fight over teams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's stupid.</v>

1865
01:26:34.341 --> 01:26:35.870
<v Speaker 2>So fucking dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's dumb.</v>

1866
01:26:35.871 --> 01:26:36.770
<v Speaker 2>It's dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

1867
01:26:36.771 --> 01:26:40.070
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to believe that that's like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>common occurrence with football,</v>

1868
01:26:40.071 --> 01:26:42.200
<v Speaker 2>with soccer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with baseball.</v>

1869
01:26:42.230 --> 01:26:44.030
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's always like fights in the</v>

1870
01:26:44.031 --> 01:26:47.330
<v Speaker 2>parking lots with the Lakers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard some terrible stories about some</v>

1871
01:26:47.331 --> 01:26:49.580
<v Speaker 2>guy was wearing the wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was written wrong.</v>

1872
01:26:49.580 --> 01:26:53.600
<v Speaker 2>Basketball team shirt and he's with his</v>
<v Speaker 2>son and these guys at the Lakers Games</v>

1873
01:26:53.601 --> 01:26:56.180
<v Speaker 2>beat the fuck out of him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Caled him knocked him out.</v>

1874
01:26:56.210 --> 01:26:59.940
<v Speaker 2>His head bounced off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The concrete was in a coma for weeks is</v>

1875
01:26:59.950 --> 01:27:02.450
<v Speaker 2>there was this kid that happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just beat the fuck out of him cause he</v>

1876
01:27:02.451 --> 01:27:04.670
<v Speaker 2>had the wrong shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't to a dude at the dodgers game</v>

1877
01:27:04.671 --> 01:27:06.860
<v Speaker 2>like a while ago when the mccourts he</v>
<v Speaker 2>used to own the team.</v>

1878
01:27:06.890 --> 01:27:09.200
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's what I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what I'm talking about?</v>

1879
01:27:09.620 --> 01:27:10.310
<v Speaker 2>Probably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1880
01:27:10.310 --> 01:27:12.040
<v Speaker 2>We're raiders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The raiders,</v>

1881
01:27:12.290 --> 01:27:13.180
<v Speaker 2>raiders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>raiders,</v>

1882
01:27:13.190 --> 01:27:15.980
<v Speaker 2>Raider fans might knock you out too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why Raider fans?</v>

1883
01:27:15.981 --> 01:27:18.980
<v Speaker 2>Comments like why is that a thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because everybody was worried about the</v>

1884
01:27:18.981 --> 01:27:21.530
<v Speaker 2>raiders came to Los Angeles that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>would have a bunch of concept.</v>

1885
01:27:21.531 --> 01:27:23.450
<v Speaker 2>The game there was a big issue.</v>

1886
01:27:23.740 --> 01:27:26.350
<v Speaker 4>It's just been their culture and</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody just identified with it and</v>

1887
01:27:26.351 --> 01:27:27.880
<v Speaker 4>accepted it and said this is who we are.</v>

1888
01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:30.990
<v Speaker 2>Is it because of rappers started taking</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the raider hats and started wearing</v>

1889
01:27:30.991 --> 01:27:33.450
<v Speaker 2>raider hats in the 80s is that what it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was that what brought it around?</v>

1890
01:27:34.060 --> 01:27:37.270
<v Speaker 4>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were like that from,</v>

1891
01:27:37.330 --> 01:27:39.190
<v Speaker 4>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it,</v>

1892
01:27:39.580 --> 01:27:44.580
<v Speaker 4>it's like there's some teams in Italy</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the fans are just bass hall</v>

1893
01:27:44.931 --> 01:27:47.860
<v Speaker 4>fascists and then they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

1894
01:27:48.090 --> 01:27:49.690
<v Speaker 4>that's some of the culture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1895
01:27:49.700 --> 01:27:50.440
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1896
01:27:50.440 --> 01:27:52.630
<v Speaker 4>it's hard to tell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the rate seemed like they've been</v>

1897
01:27:52.631 --> 01:27:55.720
<v Speaker 4>through,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've gone through all the routes to</v>

1898
01:27:55.721 --> 01:27:57.970
<v Speaker 4>have that type of fan base.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

1899
01:27:58.510 --> 01:28:00.910
<v Speaker 4>Coming up in Oakland.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So even when they moved to La and</v>

1900
01:28:00.911 --> 01:28:04.690
<v Speaker 4>rappers and started joining them and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then now they're back in Oakland,</v>

1901
01:28:05.140 --> 01:28:06.220
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I dunno,</v>

1902
01:28:06.221 --> 01:28:08.500
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just the had the right temperature</v>

1903
01:28:09.310 --> 01:28:12.010
<v Speaker 4>for four ignorance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1904
01:28:12.011 --> 01:28:13.120
<v Speaker 4>amongst their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of their friends.</v>

1905
01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:17.480
<v Speaker 2>I think there's something going on with</v>
<v Speaker 2>people to where we want to be united by</v>

1906
01:28:17.481 --> 01:28:20.570
<v Speaker 2>a common cause,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if that common causes terrible.</v>

1907
01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:22.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's one of the things that's</v>

1908
01:28:22.641 --> 01:28:24.500
<v Speaker 2>going on with trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>

1909
01:28:24.501 --> 01:28:26.870
<v Speaker 2>And I see some of these people that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>like trump supporters.</v>

1910
01:28:26.871 --> 01:28:28.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you really?</v>

1911
01:28:28.540 --> 01:28:32.270
<v Speaker 2>Or are you just in a gang?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it seems like a lot of them are</v>

1912
01:28:32.271 --> 01:28:34.550
<v Speaker 2>in a cunt gang.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they're wearing sunglasses are</v>

1913
01:28:34.551 --> 01:28:36.080
<v Speaker 2>being dicks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're walking up there,</v>

1914
01:28:36.230 --> 01:28:38.990
<v Speaker 2>they're honking at these people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>have Bernie Sanders signs.</v>

1915
01:28:38.991 --> 01:28:42.260
<v Speaker 2>If you've seen this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I forget what city it was in a where</v>

1916
01:28:42.261 --> 01:28:46.010
<v Speaker 2>Bernie Sanders wound up winning and</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump was,</v>

1917
01:28:46.011 --> 01:28:48.440
<v Speaker 2>but was a big one that he won recently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was Indiana,</v>

1918
01:28:48.770 --> 01:28:51.920
<v Speaker 2>Indiana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's driving by and these,</v>

1919
01:28:51.921 --> 01:28:54.110
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mexican Americans are on one side of the</v>

1920
01:28:54.111 --> 01:28:56.840
<v Speaker 2>road and they're fucking screaming at</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy was in a,</v>

1921
01:28:56.900 --> 01:28:58.730
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Donald Trump supporting truck and</v>

1922
01:28:58.731 --> 01:29:00.650
<v Speaker 2>they're screaming shit in hurling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1923
01:29:00.680 --> 01:29:02.250
<v Speaker 2>insults back and forth at each other.</v>

1924
01:29:02.610 --> 01:29:03.960
<v Speaker 2>And I'm watching this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going,</v>

1925
01:29:03.961 --> 01:29:05.550
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are we seeing in here?</v>

1926
01:29:05.551 --> 01:29:09.750
<v Speaker 2>Like we see in gangs form?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause it seems like they're not really</v>

1927
01:29:09.751 --> 01:29:13.080
<v Speaker 2>talking about trump's policies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not talking about his</v>

1928
01:29:13.081 --> 01:29:15.240
<v Speaker 2>credentials,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not talking about his,</v>

1929
01:29:15.750 --> 01:29:18.870
<v Speaker 2>his ability to lead and the way he</v>
<v Speaker 2>carries himself.</v>

1930
01:29:18.990 --> 01:29:21.170
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like he's their guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he,</v>

1931
01:29:21.190 --> 01:29:23.970
<v Speaker 2>they decide this is my guy I know was</v>
<v Speaker 2>changed their mind.</v>

1932
01:29:23.971 --> 01:29:25.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the guy for Douche bags.</v>

1933
01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:26.870
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1934
01:29:26.870 --> 01:29:27.703
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1935
01:29:27.900 --> 01:29:31.140
<v Speaker 2>it's discerning to people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's concerning because it makes you</v>

1936
01:29:31.141 --> 01:29:33.720
<v Speaker 2>think like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so many of us,</v>

1937
01:29:33.790 --> 01:29:36.510
<v Speaker 2>so many of us that when something can</v>
<v Speaker 2>unite us,</v>

1938
01:29:36.690 --> 01:29:38.370
<v Speaker 2>even if you're getting an ice in a bad</v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

1939
01:29:38.490 --> 01:29:40.410
<v Speaker 2>like the fucking heaven's gate cult,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1940
01:29:40.411 --> 01:29:43.790
<v Speaker 2>they all cut their legs off and fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>purple sneakers on.</v>

1941
01:29:43.810 --> 01:29:46.230
<v Speaker 2>A lot of them did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got castrated themselves.</v>

1942
01:29:46.231 --> 01:29:48.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1943
01:29:48.181 --> 01:29:50.550
<v Speaker 2>It was part of what that guy wanted</v>
<v Speaker 2>people to do and he had,</v>

1944
01:29:50.610 --> 01:29:52.740
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was gay and he didn't like being gay</v>

1945
01:29:52.741 --> 01:29:54.990
<v Speaker 2>and he was trying to free himself from</v>
<v Speaker 2>his sexuality,</v>

1946
01:29:54.991 --> 01:29:59.610
<v Speaker 2>but at least one or two of his other</v>
<v Speaker 2>like big people in that group also</v>

1947
01:29:59.611 --> 01:30:01.890
<v Speaker 2>castrated themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They couldn't just do the film,</v>

1948
01:30:01.891 --> 01:30:06.891
<v Speaker 2>like the Yakuza does this wrong with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do a joint at a time.</v>

1949
01:30:08.550 --> 01:30:09.630
<v Speaker 2>Whenever you fuck up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's okay.</v>

1950
01:30:09.660 --> 01:30:11.880
<v Speaker 3>Joined at a time chunk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember that?</v>

1951
01:30:11.940 --> 01:30:14.700
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trump painting I showed you a few weeks</v>

1952
01:30:14.700 --> 01:30:16.680
<v Speaker 3>ago that someone paying and with like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>small Dick,</v>

1953
01:30:17.010 --> 01:30:20.280
<v Speaker 3>the girl who painted it got attacked by</v>
<v Speaker 3>some trump supporters and like they</v>

1954
01:30:20.281 --> 01:30:23.320
<v Speaker 3>punched in the face and yelled trump</v>
<v Speaker 3>2016 and random the,</v>

1955
01:30:23.550 --> 01:30:24.720
<v Speaker 3>that's what she's claiming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1956
01:30:24.721 --> 01:30:26.160
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it was on tape or</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything,</v>

1957
01:30:26.161 --> 01:30:27.840
<v Speaker 3>but yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well you don't,</v>

1958
01:30:27.960 --> 01:30:30.390
<v Speaker 3>oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

1959
01:30:30.510 --> 01:30:33.150
<v Speaker 3>It happened in here and I'll shiners.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They found her where she lived.</v>

1960
01:30:33.170 --> 01:30:36.510
<v Speaker 3>It's based off of some facebook</v>
<v Speaker 3>information and found her and she came</v>

1961
01:30:36.511 --> 01:30:37.920
<v Speaker 3>outside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus.</v>

1962
01:30:38.070 --> 01:30:39.420
<v Speaker 3>That's what she's claiming though too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1963
01:30:39.570 --> 01:30:40.920
<v Speaker 3>it could be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it might not be true,</v>

1964
01:30:40.921 --> 01:30:42.450
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to say,</v>

1965
01:30:42.451 --> 01:30:45.240
<v Speaker 3>but even it probably is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's hard to tell and it's</v>

1966
01:30:45.241 --> 01:30:47.160
<v Speaker 3>unfortunate that you even have to say</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1967
01:30:47.700 --> 01:30:49.260
<v Speaker 3>but she does have tattoos on her face,</v>

1968
01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:53.220
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1969
01:30:53.730 --> 01:30:55.070
<v Speaker 2>who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1970
01:30:55.320 --> 01:30:59.070
<v Speaker 2>I would like to believe would be more</v>
<v Speaker 2>happy if she made it up,</v>

1971
01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:03.180
<v Speaker 2>but ultimately you got to kind of have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to believe someone like that.</v>

1972
01:31:03.420 --> 01:31:04.830
<v Speaker 2>That's sad because that was a cool</v>
<v Speaker 2>painting.</v>

1973
01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:09.420
<v Speaker 2>They shouldn't be so angry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would they be so angry if trump was</v>

1974
01:31:09.421 --> 01:31:10.470
<v Speaker 2>cool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'd buy that Shit.</v>

1975
01:31:10.920 --> 01:31:12.150
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like your mom and joke.</v>

1976
01:31:12.210 --> 01:31:12.871
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1977
01:31:12.871 --> 01:31:13.880
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1978
01:31:13.980 --> 01:31:16.380
<v Speaker 2>Did you see the recent thing that he has</v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

1979
01:31:16.381 --> 01:31:16.950
<v Speaker 2>on his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1980
01:31:16.950 --> 01:31:19.020
<v Speaker 2>on his twitter?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I retweeted it yesterday.</v>

1981
01:31:19.021 --> 01:31:22.530
<v Speaker 2>I was like eating a Taco bowl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love Mexicans.</v>

1982
01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:24.270
<v Speaker 2>I know Hispanics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hispanics here.</v>

1983
01:31:24.300 --> 01:31:26.610
<v Speaker 2>He's out of his fucking mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this is mad.</v>

1984
01:31:26.611 --> 01:31:28.440
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's flaunting it.</v>

1985
01:31:28.441 --> 01:31:31.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like he's reaching out and</v>

1986
01:31:31.651 --> 01:31:36.651
<v Speaker 2>tuning into the frequency of those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those kind of guys like these and</v>

1987
01:31:36.830 --> 01:31:38.640
<v Speaker 2>they're out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing is,</v>

1988
01:31:38.940 --> 01:31:43.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm not opposed to someone like him</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying it out cause it happy.</v>

1989
01:31:43.410 --> 01:31:46.380
<v Speaker 2>Cinco de Mayo Best Taco bowls are made</v>
<v Speaker 2>in trump tower grille.</v>

1990
01:31:46.560 --> 01:31:50.400
<v Speaker 2>I love Hispanics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what the fuck?</v>

1991
01:31:50.430 --> 01:31:55.170
<v Speaker 2>I love Hispanics and he's got that evil</v>
<v Speaker 2>old school.</v>

1992
01:31:55.200 --> 01:32:00.200
<v Speaker 2>The man look and someone pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you click on the picture that there's</v>

1993
01:32:00.641 --> 01:32:05.641
<v Speaker 2>a photo of his ex wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Marla maples in a bikini in the lower</v>

1994
01:32:05.681 --> 01:32:08.440
<v Speaker 2>corner of a magazine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's eating his fucking lunch on.</v>

1995
01:32:08.910 --> 01:32:13.330
<v Speaker 2>I could wonder if he just eats like he</v>
<v Speaker 2>has the news clippings of his,</v>

1996
01:32:13.510 --> 01:32:17.350
<v Speaker 2>his victims,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any piles it on his desk and that's how</v>

1997
01:32:17.351 --> 01:32:19.780
<v Speaker 2>he eats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why else would you be eating on top of a</v>

1998
01:32:19.781 --> 01:32:23.200
<v Speaker 2>pile of papers?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are trophies like he's a trophy</v>

1999
01:32:23.201 --> 01:32:26.140
<v Speaker 2>hunter instead of it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's probably all people.</v>

2000
01:32:26.141 --> 01:32:31.141
<v Speaker 2>He's burned in business deals and</v>
<v Speaker 2>facteau and smashed find competition.</v>

2001
01:32:32.320 --> 01:32:34.510
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like his favorite stories of</v>

2002
01:32:34.511 --> 01:32:35.770
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's crushed,</v>

2003
01:32:35.920 --> 01:32:39.970
<v Speaker 2>crushed you enemies have dumb driven</v>
<v Speaker 2>before you and hear the laminations up</v>

2004
01:32:39.971 --> 01:32:40.780
<v Speaker 2>to women.</v>

2005
01:32:40.780 --> 01:32:41.690
<v Speaker 2>That's what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

2006
01:32:41.980 --> 01:32:46.810
<v Speaker 2>he's eating dinner on a pile of skulls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just print.</v>

2007
01:32:47.080 --> 01:32:48.820
<v Speaker 2>What is bent films up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is,</v>

2008
01:32:48.821 --> 01:32:52.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking American Lapel Pin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>American flag.</v>

2009
01:32:52.601 --> 01:32:54.490
<v Speaker 2>Lapel Pin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of hilarious.</v>

2010
01:32:54.520 --> 01:32:58.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm so torn because as a person who</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinks that the system that we have is</v>

2011
01:32:58.691 --> 01:33:01.390
<v Speaker 2>so fucking absurd and it needs to</v>
<v Speaker 2>change,</v>

2012
01:33:01.570 --> 01:33:03.490
<v Speaker 2>this is one of the best ways to get it</v>
<v Speaker 2>to change.</v>

2013
01:33:04.150 --> 01:33:05.830
<v Speaker 2>This is proof that you're right about</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2014
01:33:05.831 --> 01:33:06.551
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2015
01:33:06.551 --> 01:33:10.360
<v Speaker 2>it just shows you like you can't have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>popularity contest to run the</v>

2016
01:33:10.361 --> 01:33:11.140
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2017
01:33:11.140 --> 01:33:13.780
<v Speaker 2>It should be more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It shouldn't be this easy,</v>

2018
01:33:14.170 --> 01:33:16.360
<v Speaker 2>and it shouldn't be an electoral</v>
<v Speaker 2>college.</v>

2019
01:33:16.361 --> 01:33:19.600
<v Speaker 2>And delegates shouldn't be able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>decide who they're gonna vote for</v>

2020
01:33:19.840 --> 01:33:23.350
<v Speaker 2>despite what the state votes for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They shouldn't be super delegates.</v>

2021
01:33:23.351 --> 01:33:27.610
<v Speaker 2>All this is craziness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have an antiquated nonsensical system</v>

2022
01:33:27.611 --> 01:33:30.040
<v Speaker 2>that was developed back when people</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrote with feathers.</v>

2023
01:33:30.520 --> 01:33:32.260
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to really fucking think about</v>

2024
01:33:32.261 --> 01:33:35.320
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for whatever dumb ass reason,</v>

2025
01:33:35.321 --> 01:33:38.950
<v Speaker 2>we continue to use the same thing and</v>
<v Speaker 2>anytime anybody talks about reforming it</v>

2026
01:33:38.951 --> 01:33:42.010
<v Speaker 2>or changing it or updating it or coming</v>
<v Speaker 2>out with new models,</v>

2027
01:33:42.011 --> 01:33:43.160
<v Speaker 2>everybody freaks the fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2028
01:33:43.270 --> 01:33:46.870
<v Speaker 2>Like it's some sacred fucking scroll</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Jesus wrote.</v>

2029
01:33:46.871 --> 01:33:49.050
<v Speaker 2>We found a clay pot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they did everything right.</v>

2030
01:33:49.051 --> 01:33:51.640
<v Speaker 2>Can we update this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's stupid as fuck.</v>

2031
01:33:51.940 --> 01:33:55.060
<v Speaker 2>And the only reason why it's in place at</v>
<v Speaker 2>all like this electoral college and</v>

2032
01:33:55.061 --> 01:33:58.840
<v Speaker 2>representative government is because you</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't talk directly to the leaders,</v>

2033
01:33:58.841 --> 01:34:00.250
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't talk to record.</v>

2034
01:34:00.260 --> 01:34:03.640
<v Speaker 2>The government was too hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we have all these new tools in place</v>

2035
01:34:03.641 --> 01:34:06.730
<v Speaker 2>and the idea that we're not using them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we're not using the internet,</v>

2036
01:34:06.731 --> 01:34:10.540
<v Speaker 2>we're not using social media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not using our instantaneous</v>

2037
01:34:10.541 --> 01:34:14.320
<v Speaker 2>ability to communicate with each other</v>
<v Speaker 2>to find out what we actually want as as</v>

2038
01:34:14.321 --> 01:34:18.430
<v Speaker 2>a collective group B.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that that's an also we should</v>

2039
01:34:18.431 --> 01:34:19.480
<v Speaker 2>agree with.</v>

2040
01:34:19.480 --> 01:34:23.200
<v Speaker 2>There should be like parameters where</v>
<v Speaker 2>things can't get past.</v>

2041
01:34:23.380 --> 01:34:25.840
<v Speaker 2>There should be like parameters where</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're all agree.</v>

2042
01:34:25.990 --> 01:34:29.230
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We cannot set aside any rules or or</v>

2043
01:34:29.231 --> 01:34:33.310
<v Speaker 2>create any laws that intentionally</v>
<v Speaker 2>victimize certain segments of the</v>

2044
01:34:33.311 --> 01:34:34.160
<v Speaker 2>population.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2045
01:34:34.450 --> 01:34:35.920
<v Speaker 2>We all agree on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2046
01:34:36.220 --> 01:34:38.050
<v Speaker 2>Like we make a new constitution type</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

2047
01:34:38.230 --> 01:34:39.820
<v Speaker 2>We all agree on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone agrees on that.</v>

2048
01:34:39.821 --> 01:34:40.271
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2049
01:34:40.271 --> 01:34:42.460
<v Speaker 2>So when anything comes up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when anything comes up,</v>

2050
01:34:42.461 --> 01:34:45.640
<v Speaker 2>whether it's about gay marriage or</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's about fucking whatever it</v>

2051
01:34:45.641 --> 01:34:47.320
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look at that and you go,</v>

2052
01:34:47.321 --> 01:34:50.770
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this a law that would victimize</v>

2053
01:34:50.860 --> 01:34:53.620
<v Speaker 2>intentionally certain aspects of our</v>
<v Speaker 2>population?</v>

2054
01:34:53.621 --> 01:34:54.910
<v Speaker 2>And if so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can't do it.</v>

2055
01:34:55.060 --> 01:34:56.890
<v Speaker 2>Especially if they're not doing anything</v>
<v Speaker 2>to anybody else.</v>

2056
01:34:56.930 --> 01:34:58.100
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should have like rules like</v>

2057
01:34:58.100 --> 01:35:00.530
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we could update and make a real</v>

2058
01:35:00.531 --> 01:35:04.690
<v Speaker 1>simple new constitution that would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>way better and we'd keep most of this</v>

2059
01:35:04.691 --> 01:35:07.340
<v Speaker 1>shit and original most of the ideas of</v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom of speech,</v>

2060
01:35:07.550 --> 01:35:11.720
<v Speaker 1>but update it to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to represent what we're dealing with</v>

2061
01:35:11.721 --> 01:35:15.380
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because what's free speeches today is</v>

2062
01:35:15.381 --> 01:35:17.690
<v Speaker 1>very different than standing on a box</v>

2063
01:35:17.880 --> 01:35:20.220
<v Speaker 2>and yelling into a courtyard without a</v>
<v Speaker 2>microphone.</v>

2064
01:35:20.250 --> 01:35:23.700
<v Speaker 2>Cause that's what people were doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>writing something down and not being</v>

2065
01:35:23.701 --> 01:35:26.220
<v Speaker 2>worried about being killed for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all agree on that kind of stuff,</v>

2066
01:35:26.490 --> 01:35:27.810
<v Speaker 2>but we should figure out like</v>

2067
01:35:28.420 --> 01:35:29.490
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

2068
01:35:29.491 --> 01:35:31.720
<v Speaker 1>what are these?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of these laws are good?</v>

2069
01:35:31.721 --> 01:35:33.520
<v Speaker 1>How many does the laws make?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any fucking sense?</v>

2070
01:35:33.640 --> 01:35:35.560
<v Speaker 1>How many of those laws are just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just have,</v>

2071
01:35:35.710 --> 01:35:39.310
<v Speaker 1>cause they've been around forever and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>examines them to just have some really</v>

2072
01:35:39.311 --> 01:35:43.420
<v Speaker 1>smart people making some really bad laws</v>
<v Speaker 1>on purpose.</v>

2073
01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:46.810
<v Speaker 1>Like it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when you said talking about laws</v>

2074
01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:51.250
<v Speaker 1>that does affect a certain segment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not making laws that affect a certain</v>

2075
01:35:51.251 --> 01:35:54.610
<v Speaker 1>segment of society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the ones that we have now that</v>

2076
01:35:54.611 --> 01:35:55.420
<v Speaker 1>exist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that does,</v>

2077
01:35:55.420 --> 01:35:58.180
<v Speaker 1>that does hurt segments of society was</v>
<v Speaker 1>done on purpose,</v>

2078
01:35:58.181 --> 01:36:01.630
<v Speaker 1>but they've just done so slickly yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

2079
01:36:02.620 --> 01:36:07.620
<v Speaker 1>it's just tough to get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just some bad people in the wrong</v>

2080
01:36:08.771 --> 01:36:09.760
<v Speaker 1>places right now.</v>

2081
01:36:10.150 --> 01:36:12.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well there's just too much money</v>

2082
01:36:12.071 --> 01:36:14.160
<v Speaker 2>involved in making decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2083
01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:18.070
<v Speaker 2>That's the big issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The big issue is there's all these</v>

2084
01:36:18.280 --> 01:36:23.280
<v Speaker 2>gigantic groups of people with immense</v>
<v Speaker 2>amounts of money and they can gain more</v>

2085
01:36:24.251 --> 01:36:27.790
<v Speaker 2>money by influence people's decision</v>
<v Speaker 2>making that are in judgment or that are</v>

2086
01:36:27.791 --> 01:36:30.520
<v Speaker 2>in positions of power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's our real problem.</v>

2087
01:36:30.910 --> 01:36:33.610
<v Speaker 2>A real problem is these giant groups of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people call them whenever you want.</v>

2088
01:36:33.611 --> 01:36:35.950
<v Speaker 2>Calm corporations column,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2089
01:36:36.040 --> 01:36:37.750
<v Speaker 2>whatever calm the banks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>call them,</v>

2090
01:36:38.050 --> 01:36:41.230
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have the ability to influence the</v>

2091
01:36:41.231 --> 01:36:45.160
<v Speaker 2>decision making of the people that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>in power and whether it's through fear,</v>

2092
01:36:45.280 --> 01:36:47.050
<v Speaker 2>intimidation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>manipulation,</v>

2093
01:36:47.051 --> 01:36:49.990
<v Speaker 2>or straight up bribing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a system that's in place.</v>

2094
01:36:49.991 --> 01:36:53.860
<v Speaker 2>It's very difficult to buck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I find it intriguing.</v>

2095
01:36:53.890 --> 01:36:57.010
<v Speaker 2>If Donald Trump gets in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't find it intriguing because I</v>

2096
01:36:57.011 --> 01:37:01.690
<v Speaker 2>like what he's saying and that I like is</v>
<v Speaker 2>this crazy character who's doing what I</v>

2097
01:37:01.720 --> 01:37:06.100
<v Speaker 2>find intriguing is it doesn't seem to</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking matter who the president is in</v>

2098
01:37:06.101 --> 01:37:07.720
<v Speaker 2>any way other than socially.</v>

2099
01:37:07.960 --> 01:37:09.460
<v Speaker 2>Like socially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems to matter.</v>

2100
01:37:09.610 --> 01:37:11.080
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think one of the best things about</v>

2101
01:37:11.081 --> 01:37:16.081
<v Speaker 2>having Obama in office was that he was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy who was pretty liberal on most</v>

2102
01:37:17.111 --> 01:37:21.190
<v Speaker 2>things as opposed to like the eight</v>
<v Speaker 2>years that we had a deal with like scary</v>

2103
01:37:21.191 --> 01:37:26.191
<v Speaker 2>conservative Bush and Donald Rumsfeld</v>
<v Speaker 2>and John Ashcroft.</v>

2104
01:37:26.920 --> 01:37:30.610
<v Speaker 2>They were scary people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like John Ashcroft covered the breast of</v>

2105
01:37:30.611 --> 01:37:32.200
<v Speaker 2>a statue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2106
01:37:32.230 --> 01:37:33.820
<v Speaker 2>was it in the White House?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2107
01:37:33.821 --> 01:37:35.420
<v Speaker 2>not the White House.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was it at the Pentagon?</v>

2108
01:37:35.440 --> 01:37:37.030
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wah Wah.</v>

2109
01:37:37.060 --> 01:37:41.320
<v Speaker 2>I forget what the statute was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they put a drape over the breasts of</v>

2110
01:37:41.321 --> 01:37:43.180
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a statue that had been exposed</v>

2111
01:37:43.181 --> 01:37:46.450
<v Speaker 2>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ashcroft was a guy went after Tommy</v>

2112
01:37:46.450 --> 01:37:49.990
<v Speaker 2>Chong and a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because Tommy Chung's son was selling</v>

2113
01:37:49.991 --> 01:37:54.340
<v Speaker 2>bongs and so he went after Tommy Chong</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying that if you don't go to jail,</v>

2114
01:37:54.341 --> 01:37:57.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to put your whole in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Tommy Chong had a wine up there was</v>

2115
01:37:57.301 --> 01:38:01.500
<v Speaker 2>all Ashcroft daily operation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nice dreams is what they were doing.</v>

2116
01:38:01.501 --> 01:38:05.130
<v Speaker 2>It was a sting operation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Justice Department covers partially nude</v>

2117
01:38:05.131 --> 01:38:08.250
<v Speaker 2>statues because of Ashcroft.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a scary,</v>

2118
01:38:08.251 --> 01:38:09.084
<v Speaker 2>scary guy.</v>

2119
01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:12.340
<v Speaker 4>And these are the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is an example of the people wrong</v>

2120
01:38:12.341 --> 01:38:15.940
<v Speaker 4>people in the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the places where they shouldn't be</v>

2121
01:38:15.941 --> 01:38:17.350
<v Speaker 4>because they're out of control.</v>

2122
01:38:17.670 --> 01:38:21.570
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it also heightened our suspicions of a</v>

2123
01:38:21.571 --> 01:38:26.070
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy theories and hysteria in this</v>
<v Speaker 2>country because we saw like really</v>

2124
01:38:26.071 --> 01:38:27.840
<v Speaker 2>dangerous people that were running the</v>
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>

2125
01:38:28.350 --> 01:38:31.110
<v Speaker 2>Like a guy like him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his fucking dangerous like Rumsfeld to</v>

2126
01:38:31.120 --> 01:38:33.510
<v Speaker 2>push aspartame.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's how it,</v>

2127
01:38:33.580 --> 01:38:35.610
<v Speaker 2>aspartame is legal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It all came out of Rumsfeld.</v>

2128
01:38:35.611 --> 01:38:37.710
<v Speaker 2>Like he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was one of those directly responsible</v>

2129
01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:41.190
<v Speaker 2>for making aspartame illegal and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and avoiding all the information that</v>

2130
01:38:41.191 --> 01:38:43.650
<v Speaker 2>pointed to the fact that it's probably</v>
<v Speaker 2>like super fucking bad.</v>

2131
01:38:43.950 --> 01:38:46.920
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] his this fucker that we</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't do anything about it.</v>

2132
01:38:47.100 --> 01:38:49.170
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we just like wrote it out.</v>

2133
01:38:49.540 --> 01:38:52.750
<v Speaker 2>Well we had to what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We didn't know what we even could do</v>

2134
01:38:52.751 --> 01:38:54.280
<v Speaker 2>then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be really interesting to see</v>

2135
01:38:54.281 --> 01:38:57.070
<v Speaker 2>what would happen if the Bush</v>
<v Speaker 2>administration was,</v>

2136
01:38:57.120 --> 01:39:00.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in office today with the current ability</v>

2137
01:39:00.521 --> 01:39:05.320
<v Speaker 2>to communicate about things because</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where it's really crazy from 2000</v>

2138
01:39:05.500 --> 01:39:10.210
<v Speaker 2>to 2016 is a different world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a different world and towards the</v>

2139
01:39:10.211 --> 01:39:13.690
<v Speaker 2>end of the Bush administration became</v>
<v Speaker 2>more and more preposterous or people</v>

2140
01:39:13.691 --> 01:39:16.900
<v Speaker 2>like what in the fuck is going on to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>point where they went out stealing</v>

2141
01:39:16.901 --> 01:39:18.790
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember when they went out and gas</v>

2142
01:39:18.791 --> 01:39:21.550
<v Speaker 2>prices went up to like fucking five</v>
<v Speaker 2>bucks a gallon and everybody's like,</v>

2143
01:39:21.551 --> 01:39:22.850
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2144
01:39:23.080 --> 01:39:26.140
<v Speaker 2>It just felt like they went out stealing</v>
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

2145
01:39:26.141 --> 01:39:26.974
<v Speaker 2>They just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2146
01:39:27.100 --> 01:39:30.160
<v Speaker 2>before Obama comes into office,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just going to suck as much money out</v>

2147
01:39:30.161 --> 01:39:31.540
<v Speaker 2>of this bitch as we can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2148
01:39:31.541 --> 01:39:33.550
<v Speaker 2>let's just go hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2149
01:39:33.551 --> 01:39:34.990
<v Speaker 2>just ridiculous.</v>

2150
01:39:35.640 --> 01:39:37.530
<v Speaker 4>What is money?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a good question.</v>

2151
01:39:37.531 --> 01:39:39.060
<v Speaker 4>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>His money and then,</v>

2152
01:39:39.300 --> 01:39:43.350
<v Speaker 4>and then the money that we lost during</v>
<v Speaker 4>the recession,</v>

2153
01:39:43.740 --> 01:39:45.690
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't burnt in a fire.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't like,</v>

2154
01:39:45.950 --> 01:39:49.260
<v Speaker 4>like that money went somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so where the fuck is that money that</v>

2155
01:39:49.261 --> 01:39:51.030
<v Speaker 4>they had to get more money to replace</v>
<v Speaker 4>that money.</v>

2156
01:39:51.031 --> 01:39:55.800
<v Speaker 4>Like somebody has that money and</v>
<v Speaker 4>spending that money so it's not like it</v>

2157
01:39:55.801 --> 01:39:57.840
<v Speaker 4>went to a vacuum.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It will never come back.</v>

2158
01:39:57.841 --> 01:40:02.841
<v Speaker 4>It's like so w it's just so</v>
<v Speaker 4>they never teach you in school,</v>

2159
01:40:03.960 --> 01:40:05.670
<v Speaker 4>so you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't think about it.</v>

2160
01:40:05.671 --> 01:40:06.504
<v Speaker 4>But where the fuck,</v>

2161
01:40:06.640 --> 01:40:07.330
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's Voodoo.</v>

2162
01:40:07.330 --> 01:40:09.070
<v Speaker 2>It's agreed upon Voodoo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2163
01:40:09.370 --> 01:40:11.410
<v Speaker 2>it's agreed upon Voodoo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's really what it is.</v>

2164
01:40:11.800 --> 01:40:13.630
<v Speaker 2>We have all the same amount of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2165
01:40:13.690 --> 01:40:16.720
<v Speaker 2>We have the same amount of minerals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have the same amount of raw materials</v>

2166
01:40:16.980 --> 01:40:20.470
<v Speaker 2>or the same amount of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have the same amount of land.</v>

2167
01:40:20.800 --> 01:40:23.260
<v Speaker 2>We have all the same stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but somehow there's no money.</v>

2168
01:40:23.280 --> 01:40:24.790
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas two months ago,</v>

2169
01:40:24.791 --> 01:40:26.620
<v Speaker 2>everybody was rolling in dough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2170
01:40:26.650 --> 01:40:28.810
<v Speaker 2>That's a sign of someone fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2171
01:40:29.020 --> 01:40:29.741
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2172

<v Speaker 2>We lost all the guy is crazy.</v>

2173
01:40:33.580 --> 01:40:35.920
<v Speaker 2>Y'all take care and we're real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

2174
01:40:35.921 --> 01:40:38.140
<v Speaker 2>Worked out this way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We gotta get going.</v>

2175
01:40:38.500 --> 01:40:40.240
<v Speaker 4>The recession was one of the craziest</v>
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

2176
01:40:40.241 --> 01:40:43.780
<v Speaker 4>Like there's like it came on new and</v>
<v Speaker 4>said what broke all the money's gone and</v>

2177
01:40:43.781 --> 01:40:47.770
<v Speaker 4>everybody just started acting broke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody was just like broken laying</v>

2178
01:40:47.771 --> 01:40:50.890
<v Speaker 4>off people that able broke y'all and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

2179
01:40:50.920 --> 01:40:53.110
<v Speaker 4>and then they say it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>things are getting better.</v>

2180
01:40:53.800 --> 01:40:54.040
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2181
01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:57.130
<v Speaker 2>I could feel it getting better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Getting better.</v>

2182
01:40:57.190 --> 01:41:01.900
<v Speaker 2>I saw something that said that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>150,000 jobs were added to the economy,</v>

2183
01:41:01.990 --> 01:41:05.260
<v Speaker 2>but unemployment stayed the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The same rate,</v>

2184
01:41:05.470 --> 01:41:09.190
<v Speaker 2>but they added 150,000 jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what is the rate base don?</v>

2185
01:41:09.580 --> 01:41:12.550
<v Speaker 2>And then someone else told me that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>rate is not based on people stop</v>

2186
01:41:12.551 --> 01:41:15.310
<v Speaker 2>looking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The rate is only based on people claim</v>

2187
01:41:15.311 --> 01:41:18.430
<v Speaker 2>unemployment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's way more unemployment than</v>

2188
01:41:18.431 --> 01:41:20.030
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just good looking.</v>

2189
01:41:21.970 --> 01:41:25.420
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>easiest time to live our everybody</v>

2190
01:41:25.421 --> 01:41:26.930
<v Speaker 2>bitching about shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's just,</v>

2191
01:41:27.190 --> 01:41:31.090
<v Speaker 2>you can take some dude from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>depression and put them in America today</v>

2192
01:41:31.220 --> 01:41:33.240
<v Speaker 2>and he'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck are you complaining about?</v>

2193
01:41:33.241 --> 01:41:35.490
<v Speaker 2>The no soup lines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one's starving it.</v>

2194
01:41:35.491 --> 01:41:38.860
<v Speaker 2>Look how big everybody is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There would be like everybody in the</v>

2195
01:41:38.860 --> 01:41:40.240
<v Speaker 2>depression days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were like 110 pounds.</v>

2196
01:41:40.840 --> 01:41:43.330
<v Speaker 2>Dudes were tiny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd be like seeing all these giant</v>

2197
01:41:43.331 --> 01:41:45.490
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mcdonald's fucking falling out of their</v>

2198

<v Speaker 2>pockets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put all the food.</v>

2199
01:41:46.750 --> 01:41:49.270
<v Speaker 2>These fucking people app or you got to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do is wait by a garbage can.</v>

2200
01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:51.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Poor people are fat today.</v>

2201
01:41:51.740 --> 01:41:55.690
<v Speaker 2>And I'm crazy that it's true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2202
01:41:56.410 --> 01:41:59.710
<v Speaker 2>I mean back then you were starving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were terrified.</v>

2203
01:42:00.310 --> 01:42:02.710
<v Speaker 2>People,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people like legitimately were worried</v>

2204
01:42:02.711 --> 01:42:04.540
<v Speaker 2>about not having something to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2205
01:42:05.230 --> 01:42:08.500
<v Speaker 2>I read this book about this guy named</v>
<v Speaker 2>Danny Mcgroarty.</v>

2206
01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:13.800
<v Speaker 2>Danny mcgurty is like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a famous depression era pool hustler who</v>

2207
01:42:14.171 --> 01:42:18.940
<v Speaker 2>traveled across the country during like</v>
<v Speaker 2>the darkest days of the depression and</v>

2208
01:42:18.941 --> 01:42:22.900
<v Speaker 2>would hustle from town to town and</v>
<v Speaker 2>gamble with guys and make money like</v>

2209
01:42:22.901 --> 01:42:26.490
<v Speaker 2>barely get by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but was an alcoholic and just wrote,</v>

2210
01:42:26.700 --> 01:42:29.800
<v Speaker 2>wrote a bunch of crazy stories about all</v>
<v Speaker 2>his times.</v>

2211
01:42:29.801 --> 01:42:32.800
<v Speaker 2>But there was times where he's begging</v>
<v Speaker 2>people for food.</v>

2212
01:42:32.890 --> 01:42:35.680
<v Speaker 2>Like he was starving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just showed up at someone's house and</v>

2213
01:42:35.681 --> 01:42:38.190
<v Speaker 2>was begging them for food and the guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>comes out and gives him a bowl,</v>

2214
01:42:38.210 --> 01:42:39.310
<v Speaker 2>sausages and shit.</v>

2215
01:42:39.310 --> 01:42:44.310
<v Speaker 2>And you realize like there were times in</v>
<v Speaker 2>this country and by the way back then,</v>

2216
01:42:44.680 --> 01:42:46.480
<v Speaker 2>no one was telling them everything's</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be okay.</v>

2217
01:42:46.481 --> 01:42:49.450
<v Speaker 2>There was no oprah on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was no positive thing.</v>

2218
01:42:49.680 --> 01:42:51.790
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was no mind coaches,</v>

2219
01:42:51.820 --> 01:42:53.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on late night infomercials,</v>

2220
01:42:53.621 --> 01:42:56.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to give you the tools to</v>
<v Speaker 2>achieve your greatness.</v>

2221
01:42:57.130 --> 01:42:59.950
<v Speaker 2>It was none of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were just almost animalistic</v>

2222
01:43:00.370 --> 01:43:03.040
<v Speaker 2>traveling around in box cars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this,</v>

2223
01:43:03.041 --> 01:43:05.440
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this book was really intense man because</v>

2224
01:43:05.441 --> 01:43:09.790
<v Speaker 2>in this guy was talking like Kinda with</v>
<v Speaker 2>shame about how he had broken down a</v>

2225
01:43:09.791 --> 01:43:12.460
<v Speaker 2>couple of times and was just asking</v>
<v Speaker 2>people for food.</v>

2226
01:43:12.970 --> 01:43:13.803
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like,</v>

2227
01:43:14.110 --> 01:43:16.060
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have any other options.</v>

2228
01:43:16.061 --> 01:43:18.640
<v Speaker 2>I had to beg people for food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you realize like,</v>

2229
01:43:18.700 --> 01:43:19.480
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2230
01:43:19.480 --> 01:43:22.510
<v Speaker 2>that's a different time than today</v>
<v Speaker 2>because people are just out there doing</v>

2231
01:43:22.511 --> 01:43:23.110
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2232
01:43:23.110 --> 01:43:23.841
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2233
01:43:23.841 --> 01:43:26.950
<v Speaker 2>this is way more charity today than ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>

2234
01:43:26.951 --> 01:43:30.430
<v Speaker 2>But I think also we understand that a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of the people that we're seeing that</v>

2235
01:43:30.431 --> 01:43:32.530
<v Speaker 2>around on the street corners and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

2236
01:43:32.750 --> 01:43:34.720
<v Speaker 2>begging,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have mental problems.</v>

2237
01:43:34.860 --> 01:43:37.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm sure they did back then too.</v>

2238
01:43:37.870 --> 01:43:42.820
<v Speaker 2>But I think back then they were probably</v>
<v Speaker 2>more people who are like legitimately</v>

2239
01:43:43.510 --> 01:43:46.420
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it didn't have the information,</v>

2240
01:43:46.750 --> 01:43:49.450
<v Speaker 2>didn't understand like where are all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>jobs where it's going,</v>

2241
01:43:49.451 --> 01:43:50.710
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the economy?</v>

2242
01:43:50.890 --> 01:43:52.900
<v Speaker 2>What does that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can google it you like.</v>

2243
01:43:52.970 --> 01:43:56.870
<v Speaker 2>So if you were a 35 year old man who was</v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially illiterate and you were a</v>

2244
01:43:56.871 --> 01:43:59.420
<v Speaker 2>labor your whole life and then also in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the jobs dried up,</v>

2245
01:43:59.450 --> 01:44:04.370
<v Speaker 2>you had no grasp of why or how to fix it</v>
<v Speaker 2>or who was going to change it.</v>

2246
01:44:04.580 --> 01:44:08.360
<v Speaker 2>So any politician has stood up and</v>
<v Speaker 2>started yelling things about immigrants</v>

2247
01:44:08.630 --> 01:44:10.190
<v Speaker 2>or about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's essentially what happened</v>

2248
01:44:10.191 --> 01:44:13.790
<v Speaker 2>to Hitler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hitler rose to power because Germany was</v>

2249
01:44:13.910 --> 01:44:17.360
<v Speaker 2>in a bad economic place and this guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>came along and said,</v>

2250
01:44:17.361 --> 01:44:18.950
<v Speaker 2>these mother fuckers are ruining it for</v>
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>

2251
01:44:18.951 --> 01:44:19.784
<v Speaker 2>And everybody was like,</v>

2252
01:44:21.430 --> 01:44:22.263
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2253
01:44:22.340 --> 01:44:25.550
<v Speaker 2>they all just jumped on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was so charismatic too.</v>

2254
01:44:25.551 --> 01:44:30.050
<v Speaker 2>That's another scary thing about a guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's really charismatic that can unite</v>

2255
01:44:30.051 --> 01:44:32.000
<v Speaker 2>people for a cause,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if it's</v>

2256
01:44:32.060 --> 01:44:34.070
<v Speaker 4>bad one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what's crazy about,</v>

2257
01:44:34.370 --> 01:44:36.290
<v Speaker 4>I went to a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what they call it,</v>

2258
01:44:36.291 --> 01:44:38.510
<v Speaker 4>like a opera.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's the thing that they have the</v>

2259
01:44:38.511 --> 01:44:40.910
<v Speaker 4>conductor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So opera as an opera,</v>

2260
01:44:40.970 --> 01:44:43.200
<v Speaker 4>music symphony,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the symphony and uh,</v>

2261
01:44:43.410 --> 01:44:45.780
<v Speaker 4>the thing when they have doctor</v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] saying,</v>

2262
01:44:47.310 --> 01:44:48.710
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm hot orchestra,</v>

2263
01:44:49.840 --> 01:44:52.940
<v Speaker 4>I'm hot box.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know if I'm saying that</v>

2264
01:44:52.941 --> 01:44:54.980
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hot Box and drill hotboxing is real</v>

2265
01:44:54.981 --> 01:44:56.800
<v Speaker 4>y'all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a lot of people don't believe.</v>

2266
01:44:56.950 --> 01:45:01.950
<v Speaker 4>And I was watching the conductor and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a lot of Jewish people there and</v>

2267
01:45:02.451 --> 01:45:04.850
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the conductor is doing this shit and if</v>

2268
01:45:04.851 --> 01:45:08.780
<v Speaker 4>you turn off the music is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>looks like you're watching Hitler.</v>

2269
01:45:10.040 --> 01:45:10.880
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2270
01:45:10.881 --> 01:45:15.200
<v Speaker 4>Because the conductor has the same</v>
<v Speaker 4>motions as Hitler,</v>

2271
01:45:16.110 --> 01:45:17.750
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at a,</v>

2272
01:45:17.810 --> 01:45:20.210
<v Speaker 4>at an opera,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the way he's directing the band.</v>

2273
01:45:20.211 --> 01:45:21.710
<v Speaker 4>Someone should make a split screen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2274
01:45:22.790 --> 01:45:24.260
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hitler was really animated,</v>

2275
01:45:24.261 --> 01:45:24.891
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2276
01:45:24.891 --> 01:45:29.630
<v Speaker 4>He's really animated and moving this up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's been an interesting,</v>

2277
01:45:29.631 --> 01:45:32.900
<v Speaker 4>when you stop and think about that is</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we don't like that from a</v>

2278
01:45:32.901 --> 01:45:34.700
<v Speaker 4>president.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't like it.</v>

2279
01:45:34.970 --> 01:45:39.020
<v Speaker 4>And it's one of the things that sank.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Howard Dean said Howard Dean got caught</v>

2280
01:45:39.021 --> 01:45:40.310
<v Speaker 4>screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 4>remember that?</v>

2281
01:45:40.800 --> 01:45:42.180
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it was August.</v>

2282
01:45:42.290 --> 01:45:43.770
<v Speaker 4>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2283
01:45:43.820 --> 01:45:45.020
<v Speaker 4>And it was over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was over.</v>

2284
01:45:45.021 --> 01:45:46.070
<v Speaker 4>It was like a bad thing.</v>

2285
01:45:46.330 --> 01:45:48.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't want anyone yelling.</v>

2286
01:45:49.270 --> 01:45:54.270
<v Speaker 2>We don't want anyone is</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you see Hitler in those speeches,</v>

2287
01:45:54.911 --> 01:45:59.430
<v Speaker 2>that fucking dynamic way of talking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that scares the shit out of everybody.</v>

2288
01:45:59.700 --> 01:46:01.280
<v Speaker 4>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was good for back then.</v>

2289
01:46:01.400 --> 01:46:03.020
<v Speaker 4>You could,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could reach people back then cause</v>

2290
01:46:03.310 --> 01:46:05.210
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's like expressing the anger.</v>

2291
01:46:05.260 --> 01:46:07.180
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that everybody was feeling well</v>

2292
01:46:07.180 --> 01:46:11.110
<v Speaker 2>in a way that's where people have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>legitimate beef without trump is</v>

2293
01:46:11.111 --> 01:46:15.280
<v Speaker 2>behaving because although it might be</v>
<v Speaker 2>effective in getting people to pay</v>

2294
01:46:15.281 --> 01:46:17.740
<v Speaker 2>attention to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very dangerous in the doors.</v>

2295
01:46:17.741 --> 01:46:20.320
<v Speaker 2>It opens up as far as like getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>people to unite like,</v>

2296
01:46:20.530 --> 01:46:22.570
<v Speaker 2>like the Shitty said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was on the phone with the</v>

2297
01:46:22.571 --> 01:46:26.950
<v Speaker 2>president of Mexico and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who you think is going to pay for that</v>

2298
01:46:26.951 --> 01:46:27.850
<v Speaker 2>wall?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

2299
01:46:27.851 --> 01:46:30.100
<v Speaker 2>you're going to pay for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not going to pay for it.</v>

2300
01:46:30.220 --> 01:46:33.460
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the fence just got 10 feet taller</v>

2301
01:46:33.640 --> 01:46:37.000
<v Speaker 2>and the whole audience cheers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's like a f I'm paraphrasing,</v>

2302
01:46:37.100 --> 01:46:39.130
<v Speaker 2>it's too fucked up a speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>

2303
01:46:39.220 --> 01:46:41.920
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea that he would like yell that</v>

2304
01:46:41.921 --> 01:46:43.930
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fence just got taller.</v>

2305
01:46:44.140 --> 01:46:46.990
<v Speaker 2>So you're going to make a fence taller</v>
<v Speaker 2>than it needs to be.</v>

2306
01:46:47.310 --> 01:46:50.310
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you spite this person like is this,</v>

2307
01:46:50.340 --> 01:46:54.570
<v Speaker 2>is this a normal behavior pattern for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>leader of the greatest army the world</v>

2308
01:46:54.571 --> 01:46:55.600
<v Speaker 2>has ever known?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2309
01:46:55.710 --> 01:46:56.640
<v Speaker 2>And seems crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2310
01:46:56.680 --> 01:46:57.513
<v Speaker 4>Plus in a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a,</v>

2311
01:46:57.670 --> 01:47:01.390
<v Speaker 4>especially in a world where we're</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mexicans who smuggle stuff across the</v>

2312
01:47:01.391 --> 01:47:03.190
<v Speaker 4>board of build tunnels.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2313
01:47:03.400 --> 01:47:07.000
<v Speaker 4>Including they snubbed muggles smuggle</v>
<v Speaker 4>people through on the tunnel.</v>

2314
01:47:07.001 --> 01:47:10.360
<v Speaker 4>So good luck building your wall.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your wall will never affect anything.</v>

2315
01:47:10.780 --> 01:47:12.580
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But they don't go over,</v>

2316
01:47:12.610 --> 01:47:16.090
<v Speaker 4>they don't go over like they have all</v>
<v Speaker 4>these secret tunnels like every,</v>

2317
01:47:16.240 --> 01:47:20.110
<v Speaker 4>every documentary or even Scicaro,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2318
01:47:20.680 --> 01:47:23.750
<v Speaker 4>it's just all tunnels.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And apparently that's real too.</v>

2319
01:47:23.760 --> 01:47:25.810
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And your president is talking about</v>

2320
01:47:25.811 --> 01:47:26.680
<v Speaker 4>building a wall.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

2321
01:47:27.010 --> 01:47:30.490
<v Speaker 4>he sounds dumb as shit you're president</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be.</v>

2322
01:47:30.580 --> 01:47:32.680
<v Speaker 4>How are you going to find all those</v>
<v Speaker 4>tunnels?</v>

2323
01:47:32.880 --> 01:47:34.220
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you know how much square right</v>

2324
01:47:34.240 --> 01:47:36.520
<v Speaker 2>miles you're dealing with and how deep</v>
<v Speaker 2>they go in?</v>

2325
01:47:36.880 --> 01:47:39.790
<v Speaker 2>Especially when you look at like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys got out El Chapo,</v>

2326
01:47:40.120 --> 01:47:41.170
<v Speaker 2>they went a mile in.</v>

2327
01:47:41.250 --> 01:47:44.400
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A mile on the ground from my thing is</v>

2328
01:47:44.401 --> 01:47:45.690
<v Speaker 4>underground.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything's on the ground.</v>

2329
01:47:46.170 --> 01:47:50.430
<v Speaker 4>Like the construction noise that you'll</v>
<v Speaker 4>make it to build a wall,</v>

2330
01:47:50.670 --> 01:47:52.950
<v Speaker 4>helps them to dig tunnels.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2331
01:47:53.100 --> 01:47:56.530
<v Speaker 4>The time the San at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're just smothering the sound.</v>

2332
01:47:58.340 --> 01:48:00.300
<v Speaker 4>They like the best tunnel builders ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2333
01:48:01.980 --> 01:48:04.080
<v Speaker 4>If you really think about this tunnel</v>
<v Speaker 4>builders in the game,</v>

2334
01:48:04.200 --> 01:48:06.930
<v Speaker 4>who's built more secret tunnels in</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mexican drug dealers,</v>

2335
01:48:07.020 --> 01:48:09.390
<v Speaker 4>fucking nobody about is this El Chapo is</v>
<v Speaker 4>tunnel.</v>

2336
01:48:10.020 --> 01:48:12.990
<v Speaker 4>I was looking at that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I just typed in generic tunnel for</v>

2337
01:48:13.770 --> 01:48:14.790
<v Speaker 2>drug tunnels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2338
01:48:14.820 --> 01:48:15.900
<v Speaker 2>there's a ton of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2339
01:48:16.140 --> 01:48:17.790
<v Speaker 2>They just keep digging them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

2340
01:48:18.060 --> 01:48:21.450
<v Speaker 2>it's so fascinating that there's this</v>
<v Speaker 2>border,</v>

2341
01:48:21.570 --> 01:48:26.340
<v Speaker 2>we have this line and if you get to dig</v>
<v Speaker 2>a hole and pop out on the other side,</v>

2342
01:48:26.380 --> 01:48:29.650
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] sell drugs pop out on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>other side.</v>

2343
01:48:30.200 --> 01:48:32.160
<v Speaker 2>It's Hilarious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's so weird.</v>

2344
01:48:32.161 --> 01:48:35.340
<v Speaker 2>Like what a weird fucking thing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've done.</v>

2345
01:48:35.341 --> 01:48:40.341
<v Speaker 2>We've made lines on the ground of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>earth that you can't cross and there's</v>

2346
01:48:40.570 --> 01:48:43.710
<v Speaker 2>no difference between the people on</v>
<v Speaker 2>either side other than the fact that</v>

2347
01:48:43.920 --> 01:48:46.380
<v Speaker 2>they speak different languages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're just people and there's a</v>

2348
01:48:46.381 --> 01:48:49.620
<v Speaker 2>lot of each people on the other side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My fucking parents live in Mexico,</v>

2349
01:48:49.621 --> 01:48:50.060
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2350
01:48:50.060 --> 01:48:50.893
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2351
01:48:50.900 --> 01:48:52.120
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then he did tell me that</v>

2352
01:48:52.520 --> 01:48:54.290
<v Speaker 2>Mexicans live in America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2353
01:48:54.291 --> 01:48:55.970
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of my friends are from Mac.</v>

2354
01:48:55.971 --> 01:48:58.160
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot of people from Mexico a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot.</v>

2355
01:48:58.370 --> 01:49:02.540
<v Speaker 2>Like I know I probably know 20 or 30</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who were born in Mexico.</v>

2356
01:49:02.541 --> 01:49:03.980
<v Speaker 2>So we integrated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2357
01:49:04.010 --> 01:49:08.420
<v Speaker 2>Obviously there's no difference between</v>
<v Speaker 2>us other than than culture and language.</v>

2358
01:49:08.421 --> 01:49:11.060
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we still have this crazy line,</v>

2359
01:49:11.270 --> 01:49:12.890
<v Speaker 2>like you can't come over and you guys</v>
<v Speaker 2>are fucked.</v>

2360
01:49:12.891 --> 01:49:13.790
<v Speaker 2>Your listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

2361
01:49:13.791 --> 01:49:14.570
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen.</v>

2362
01:49:14.570 --> 01:49:17.030
<v Speaker 2>You were born into a worse system than</v>
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>

2363
01:49:17.210 --> 01:49:19.550
<v Speaker 2>We can't let you over here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you want to get better,</v>

2364
01:49:19.670 --> 01:49:20.780
<v Speaker 2>but fuck off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you.</v>

2365
01:49:20.950 --> 01:49:22.550
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you get better over on this side,</v>

2366
01:49:22.551 --> 01:49:23.810
<v Speaker 2>if you're born at Phoenix,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2367
01:49:23.811 --> 01:49:26.720
<v Speaker 2>you missed it by a mile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you landed in Phoenix,</v>

2368
01:49:26.721 --> 01:49:28.430
<v Speaker 2>if you came out of your mother's Pussy</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Phoenix,</v>

2369
01:49:28.431 --> 01:49:29.750
<v Speaker 2>your goal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

2370
01:49:29.751 --> 01:49:31.760
<v Speaker 2>didn't you get fucking Medicare and all</v>
<v Speaker 2>that good shit.</v>

2371
01:49:31.761 --> 01:49:35.450
<v Speaker 2>You in the obamacare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you're born a mile the other way,</v>

2372
01:49:35.510 --> 01:49:36.490
<v Speaker 2>flux Ville.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2373
01:49:36.830 --> 01:49:39.080
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's so crazy.</v>

2374
01:49:39.710 --> 01:49:43.640
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't make like logically I</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand there's a limited amount of</v>

2375
01:49:43.641 --> 01:49:45.770
<v Speaker 2>resources.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand there's gotta be some</v>

2376
01:49:45.771 --> 01:49:47.770
<v Speaker 2>pragmatic decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very unfortunate,</v>

2377
01:49:47.771 --> 01:49:50.370
<v Speaker 2>but we'll really have to do is help Max</v>
<v Speaker 2>go get back on their feet up,</v>

2378
01:49:50.371 --> 01:49:50.530
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>

2379
01:49:50.530 --> 01:49:51.363
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

2380
01:49:52.720 --> 01:49:55.900
<v Speaker 2>But really what it should be is it</v>
<v Speaker 2>should be no Mexico.</v>

2381
01:49:55.930 --> 01:49:58.060
<v Speaker 2>There should be no United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It should be no Canada.</v>

2382
01:49:58.090 --> 01:49:59.520
<v Speaker 2>There should be the planet earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2383
01:49:59.770 --> 01:50:03.190
<v Speaker 2>That's really what it should be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If these ideas are fucking stupid,</v>

2384
01:50:03.520 --> 01:50:04.720
<v Speaker 2>they're like soccer clubs.</v>

2385
01:50:05.320 --> 01:50:06.170
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whoa.</v>

2386
01:50:06.220 --> 01:50:07.170
<v Speaker 4>We're like little soccer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2387
01:50:07.171 --> 01:50:10.980
<v Speaker 4>those things make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2388
01:50:10.981 --> 01:50:13.130
<v Speaker 4>but I'm 1000% with you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's all,</v>

2389
01:50:13.290 --> 01:50:16.530
<v Speaker 4>there's enough resources in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If everybody shares him,</v>

2390
01:50:16.531 --> 01:50:17.470
<v Speaker 4>wait.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2391
01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:19.280
<v Speaker 4>For everything to be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

2392
01:50:19.370 --> 01:50:22.520
<v Speaker 2>Well both you and I are a direct result</v>
<v Speaker 2>of immigration,</v>

2393
01:50:22.550 --> 01:50:25.730
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>My parents were the first generation</v>

2394
01:50:25.910 --> 01:50:28.790
<v Speaker 2>they came from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or they were born in America,</v>

2395
01:50:28.791 --> 01:50:30.260
<v Speaker 2>but their parents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my grandparents.</v>

2396
01:50:30.290 --> 01:50:31.460
<v Speaker 2>Is that how it works?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the first?</v>

2397
01:50:31.461 --> 01:50:32.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm third generation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2398
01:50:32.571 --> 01:50:35.510
<v Speaker 2>Because my parents were second</v>
<v Speaker 2>generation because my grandparents were</v>

2399
01:50:35.511 --> 01:50:37.940
<v Speaker 2>first generation Americans when they</v>
<v Speaker 2>moved to America.</v>

2400
01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.550
<v Speaker 2>They weren't born in America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How's it work?</v>

2401
01:50:40.940 --> 01:50:42.960
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my parents were born here is the</v>

2402
01:50:42.961 --> 01:50:43.940
<v Speaker 2>first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first generation.</v>

2403
01:50:43.941 --> 01:50:46.280
<v Speaker 2>So I'm second generation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm second generation.</v>

2404
01:50:46.281 --> 01:50:48.590
<v Speaker 2>So just two generations ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2405
01:50:48.650 --> 01:50:52.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm all of my family in Ireland.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of them,</v>

2406
01:50:52.320 --> 01:50:52.940
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone,</v>

2407
01:50:52.940 --> 01:50:55.970
<v Speaker 2>my grandfather on my father's side came</v>
<v Speaker 2>from Ireland.</v>

2408
01:50:56.120 --> 01:50:57.260
<v Speaker 2>My father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2409
01:50:57.261 --> 01:50:59.960
<v Speaker 2>or my grandmother on my father's side</v>
<v Speaker 2>came from Italy.</v>

2410
01:51:00.230 --> 01:51:02.810
<v Speaker 2>My grandmother and my grandfather on my</v>
<v Speaker 2>mother's side came from Italy.</v>

2411
01:51:02.870 --> 01:51:05.480
<v Speaker 2>Everybody came from another country all</v>
<v Speaker 2>during the same time period.</v>

2412
01:51:05.610 --> 01:51:08.030
<v Speaker 2>So they were all like immigrants that</v>
<v Speaker 2>came over here.</v>

2413
01:51:08.630 --> 01:51:11.930
<v Speaker 2>And this is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is why the United States is so</v>

2414
01:51:11.931 --> 01:51:14.210
<v Speaker 2>interesting because there's so many</v>
<v Speaker 2>different kinds of people here,</v>

2415
01:51:14.930 --> 01:51:16.910
<v Speaker 2>but there's just too many of us since</v>
<v Speaker 2>two.</v>

2416
01:51:16.911 --> 01:51:19.300
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This experiment was too bad ass</v>

2417
01:51:23.080 --> 01:51:24.660
<v Speaker 2>Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what happened in Mexico.</v>

2418
01:51:24.680 --> 01:51:26.480
<v Speaker 2>You know what went wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got cut off.</v>

2419
01:51:26.840 --> 01:51:28.940
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it has?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know people don't want to share,</v>

2420
01:51:28.941 --> 01:51:30.680
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People just want mine.</v>

2421
01:51:31.010 --> 01:51:32.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Man.</v>

2422
01:51:32.780 --> 01:51:37.780
<v Speaker 2>I wonder how much of what Mexico is</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now is a direct result of the</v>

2423
01:51:38.001 --> 01:51:42.110
<v Speaker 2>Spanish invasions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder when something happens,</v>

2424
01:51:42.111 --> 01:51:46.610
<v Speaker 2>like during like the Aztec days and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some crazy takeover and that</v>

2425
01:51:46.611 --> 01:51:50.820
<v Speaker 2>Spanish language gets introduced to s to</v>
<v Speaker 2>Central America and,</v>

2426
01:51:50.821 --> 01:51:52.340
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and even North America.</v>

2427
01:51:52.580 --> 01:51:54.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of Camp California will we call</v>

2428
01:51:54.561 --> 01:51:59.561
<v Speaker 2>California used to be Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I wonder like what impact that had</v>

2429
01:51:59.721 --> 01:52:03.530
<v Speaker 2>because when you find out the atrocities</v>
<v Speaker 2>that were committed with,</v>

2430
01:52:03.710 --> 01:52:04.550
<v Speaker 2>with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2431
01:52:04.580 --> 01:52:07.250
<v Speaker 2>the Aztecs and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2432
01:52:07.280 --> 01:52:10.460
<v Speaker 2>the invaders and the introduction of</v>
<v Speaker 2>horse backs,</v>

2433
01:52:10.880 --> 01:52:12.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people riding horseback,</v>

2434
01:52:12.710 --> 01:52:15.680
<v Speaker 2>that was all during Cortez,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2435
01:52:15.680 --> 01:52:19.760
<v Speaker 2>And the people before him was all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Europeans that had brought over horses.</v>

2436
01:52:20.280 --> 01:52:23.990
<v Speaker 2>Just think about all that chaos that</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened and they changed the language</v>

2437
01:52:23.991 --> 01:52:25.550
<v Speaker 2>of the country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2438
01:52:25.551 --> 01:52:30.551
<v Speaker 2>the biggest maintain Mexico was</v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially native Americans.</v>

2439
01:52:31.310 --> 01:52:34.460
<v Speaker 2>That's why like the Mayans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they really resemble like a lot of</v>

2440
01:52:34.461 --> 01:52:35.570
<v Speaker 2>native Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we,</v>

2441
01:52:35.571 --> 01:52:38.150
<v Speaker 2>what we think of as native Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you look at,</v>

2442
01:52:38.151 --> 01:52:41.390
<v Speaker 2>there's like a bunch of different styles</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Mexican,</v>

2443
01:52:41.420 --> 01:52:44.780
<v Speaker 2>like their appearance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got like your Canelo Alvarez,</v>

2444
01:52:44.990 --> 01:52:46.280
<v Speaker 2>you've got like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's real,</v>

2445
01:52:46.281 --> 01:52:47.750
<v Speaker 2>he's an outlier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a rare one.</v>

2446
01:52:47.900 --> 01:52:51.950
<v Speaker 2>But you've got like Oscar de la Hoya.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's that like handsome Spaniard version</v>

2447
01:52:51.951 --> 01:52:53.030
<v Speaker 2>of Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2448
01:52:53.510 --> 01:52:58.510
<v Speaker 2>And then you got like real brown looking</v>
<v Speaker 2>dudes that look like native Americans</v>

2449
01:52:59.540 --> 01:53:04.540
<v Speaker 2>that are also Mexican that are like</v>
<v Speaker 2>really dark and you go with that guy</v>

2450
01:53:04.551 --> 01:53:06.350
<v Speaker 2>looks like a mirror.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm American Indian.</v>

2451
01:53:06.351 --> 01:53:08.840
<v Speaker 2>What we consider a native American</v>
<v Speaker 2>because this is like,</v>

2452
01:53:08.841 --> 01:53:09.860
<v Speaker 2>that's what it is.</v>

2453
01:53:09.950 --> 01:53:12.920
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were introduced like the Spanish</v>

2454
01:53:12.921 --> 01:53:17.921
<v Speaker 2>language and all these different people</v>
<v Speaker 2>from Europe interbred with all the</v>

2455
01:53:18.021 --> 01:53:21.770
<v Speaker 2>people that are here and they created,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is Mexico hilarious picture.</v>

2456
01:53:21.771 --> 01:53:25.010
<v Speaker 2>Cause it's like who drew that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't even look like that.</v>

2457
01:53:25.011 --> 01:53:28.520
<v Speaker 2>Like those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are hot instagram trick chicks.</v>

2458
01:53:30.350 --> 01:53:32.800
<v Speaker 2>Who drew this version of that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those supposed to,</v>

2459
01:53:32.801 --> 01:53:35.000
<v Speaker 2>some of them are supposed to be men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh for real?</v>

2460
01:53:35.001 --> 01:53:36.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just covering their decks.</v>

2461
01:53:36.860 --> 01:53:40.730
<v Speaker 2>Some of them are supposed to be men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See that one's got his a transgender.</v>

2462
01:53:41.760 --> 01:53:44.900
<v Speaker 2>What's going on in this photo?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I think these people,</v>

2463
01:53:44.901 --> 01:53:46.700
<v Speaker 2>like native Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you stay,</v>

2464
01:53:46.701 --> 01:53:48.600
<v Speaker 2>keep their hair long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's what it's depicting.</v>

2465
01:53:49.250 --> 01:53:51.470
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you think of native Americans and</v>

2466
01:53:51.471 --> 01:53:53.210
<v Speaker 2>you think of like cowboys versus</v>
<v Speaker 2>Indians,</v>

2467
01:53:53.240 --> 01:53:54.330
<v Speaker 2>they all have long hair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2468
01:53:54.650 --> 01:53:57.200
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that that's what these people</v>

2469
01:53:57.201 --> 01:54:02.201
<v Speaker 2>were encountering back then and I mean</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a fucking genocide man.</v>

2470
01:54:02.750 --> 01:54:05.690
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was essentially just a</v>
<v Speaker 2>slaughter fest.</v>

2471
01:54:06.020 --> 01:54:08.750
<v Speaker 2>They killed so many fucking people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They stole gold.</v>

2472
01:54:08.930 --> 01:54:11.570
<v Speaker 2>They came over on horseback.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were considered gods.</v>

2473
01:54:11.780 --> 01:54:16.070
<v Speaker 2>Nobody knew what it was to ride a horse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He never imagined a guy comes over for</v>

2474
01:54:16.071 --> 01:54:16.904
<v Speaker 2>the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

2475
01:54:17.090 --> 01:54:19.580
<v Speaker 2>they land in a boat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get off the boat and they have</v>

2476
01:54:19.581 --> 01:54:22.640
<v Speaker 2>horses and swords and they start fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>shopping everybody up.</v>

2477
01:54:23.950 --> 01:54:25.310
<v Speaker 2>They probably had horses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

2478
01:54:25.460 --> 01:54:27.230
<v Speaker 2>and had seen horses or maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2479
01:54:27.231 --> 01:54:29.840
<v Speaker 2>no they didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't even have American horses</v>

2480
01:54:29.841 --> 01:54:32.960
<v Speaker 2>were introduced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Horses were introduced to North American</v>

2481
01:54:32.961 --> 01:54:34.550
<v Speaker 2>by the European there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

2482
01:54:34.551 --> 01:54:37.790
<v Speaker 2>By the Europeans?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was horses in North America</v>

2483
01:54:37.791 --> 01:54:40.250
<v Speaker 2>millions of years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they went extinct.</v>

2484
01:54:40.490 --> 01:54:42.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure I'm almost positive of</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

2485
01:54:42.870 --> 01:54:46.820
<v Speaker 2>If there was a type of horse that lived</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in the pleistocene or something</v>

2486
01:54:46.821 --> 01:54:49.370
<v Speaker 2>like that and they went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they went extinct.</v>

2487
01:54:49.520 --> 01:54:50.330
<v Speaker 2>But when it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2488
01:54:50.330 --> 01:54:51.163
<v Speaker 2>find that out.</v>

2489
01:54:51.170 --> 01:54:55.280
<v Speaker 2>That's an interesting when is when we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>horses first introduced to North</v>

2490
01:54:55.281 --> 01:54:58.010
<v Speaker 2>America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but horses being wild,</v>

2491
01:54:58.011 --> 01:55:02.720
<v Speaker 2>like wild horses is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a relatively recent phenomenon like over</v>

2492
01:55:02.721 --> 01:55:04.340
<v Speaker 2>the last few hundred years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gosh,</v>

2493
01:55:04.341 --> 01:55:06.940
<v Speaker 2>American with Columbus in 1493 there you</v>
<v Speaker 2>go.</v>

2494
01:55:07.490 --> 01:55:12.490
<v Speaker 2>Is second voice voyage to America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Spanish horses representing e Taleb</v>

2495
01:55:13.610 --> 01:55:14.120
<v Speaker 2>Bowel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

2496
01:55:14.120 --> 01:55:17.240
<v Speaker 2>Kabbalists Cabela's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cabela's or brought back to North</v>

2497
01:55:17.241 --> 01:55:19.640
<v Speaker 2>America first and the Virgin Islands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in 15,</v>

2498
01:55:19.641 --> 01:55:22.340
<v Speaker 2>19,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were reintroduced to the con on the</v>

2499
01:55:22.341 --> 01:55:24.200
<v Speaker 2>continent in Monterrey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mexico.</v>

2500
01:55:24.660 --> 01:55:26.930
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from where they radiated through the</v>

2501
01:55:26.931 --> 01:55:28.760
<v Speaker 2>American great plains.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

2502
01:55:29.060 --> 01:55:29.893
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See Man,</v>

2503
01:55:30.170 --> 01:55:32.690
<v Speaker 2>I feel bad for the horse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just being on a boat that long.</v>

2504
01:55:33.350 --> 01:55:34.071
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no shit.</v>

2505
01:55:34.071 --> 01:55:35.490
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder how many of them survived.</v>

2506
01:55:35.491 --> 01:55:36.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a long ass trip.</v>

2507
01:55:36.860 --> 01:55:40.040
<v Speaker 2>I wonder how they did that because that</v>
<v Speaker 2>was months and months at sea you had to</v>

2508
01:55:40.041 --> 01:55:43.100
<v Speaker 2>have the right amount of food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People getting scurvy and shit.</v>

2509
01:55:43.380 --> 01:55:46.440
<v Speaker 2>I bet it's probably easier to bring hay</v>
<v Speaker 2>than it is to bring anything.</v>

2510
01:55:47.210 --> 01:55:50.590
<v Speaker 2>You know when you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey you can stack it up nice and dense,</v>

2511
01:55:51.150 --> 01:55:54.930
<v Speaker 2>but horses eat a lot of fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey you have to clean up after them and</v>

2512
01:55:54.931 --> 01:55:59.340
<v Speaker 2>they on the over the place that makes</v>
<v Speaker 2>the boat trip even worse than I imagined</v>

2513
01:55:59.341 --> 01:56:01.830
<v Speaker 2>it in the first place because boss is on</v>
<v Speaker 2>board,</v>

2514
01:56:01.920 --> 01:56:05.340
<v Speaker 2>they're going to get off the boat and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they haven't run or walk through it all</v>

2515
01:56:05.341 --> 01:56:07.440
<v Speaker 2>and months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their legs are going to be all fucked</v>

2516
01:56:07.441 --> 01:56:08.274
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2517
01:56:08.490 --> 01:56:11.190
<v Speaker 3>I was just thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was looking for a picture but at a</v>

2518
01:56:11.191 --> 01:56:13.470
<v Speaker 3>representation of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause they're in Columbus where I'm</v>

2519
01:56:13.471 --> 01:56:14.250
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

2520
01:56:14.250 --> 01:56:16.800
<v Speaker 3>they have a replica of the Santa Maria,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is one of those boats.</v>

2521
01:56:17.010 --> 01:56:21.810
<v Speaker 3>It's not very big at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>20 or 30 people could like comfortably</v>

2522
01:56:22.380 --> 01:56:25.500
<v Speaker 3>just be on it for a long period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I don't know where the hell you would</v>

2523
01:56:25.501 --> 01:56:27.000
<v Speaker 3>put animals to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where is it?</v>

2524
01:56:27.200 --> 01:56:28.770
<v Speaker 3>It's on the river.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

2525
01:56:28.800 --> 01:56:31.020
<v Speaker 3>Like grand right in downtown Columbus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How big is it?</v>

2526
01:56:31.021 --> 01:56:32.310
<v Speaker 3>Like if you had to guess,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty big.</v>

2527
01:56:33.390 --> 01:56:36.460
<v Speaker 3>How many feet long?</v>
<v Speaker 3>60 50 60 that's it.</v>

2528
01:56:36.540 --> 01:56:37.320
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2529
01:56:37.320 --> 01:56:39.380
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to guess in my head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to yards.</v>

2530
01:56:39.890 --> 01:56:41.970
<v Speaker 3>It's not that big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll pull a picture of it.</v>

2531
01:56:41.971 --> 01:56:43.710
<v Speaker 3>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's 20 yards.</v>

2532
01:56:43.860 --> 01:56:45.990
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's like what you shoot when you're</v>

2533
01:56:45.991 --> 01:56:47.940
<v Speaker 3>practicing with a boat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A tune it in.</v>

2534
01:56:48.100 --> 01:56:50.880
<v Speaker 3>That's great for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Start backing up those little things.</v>

2535
01:56:50.881 --> 01:56:52.200
<v Speaker 3>Change the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2536
01:56:52.290 --> 01:56:56.700
<v Speaker 3>So much like if the scale of those</v>
<v Speaker 3>things to how much they changed the</v>

2537
01:56:56.701 --> 01:56:58.620
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fucking crazy.</v>

2538
01:56:58.680 --> 01:57:00.020
<v Speaker 3>That's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's nothing.</v>

2539
01:57:00.100 --> 01:57:00.933
<v Speaker 3>I do think that is</v>

2540
01:57:01.210 --> 01:57:03.100
<v Speaker 2>nothing that's small as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

2541
01:57:04.180 --> 01:57:05.250
<v Speaker 2>that's so interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ian,</v>

2542
01:57:05.251 --> 01:57:06.790
<v Speaker 2>what you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way you just explained that,</v>

2543
01:57:06.791 --> 01:57:08.920
<v Speaker 2>that's such a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like a nuclear three of those,</v>

2544
01:57:08.950 --> 01:57:12.100
<v Speaker 2>three of those fucking a man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boy,</v>

2545
01:57:12.101 --> 01:57:14.800
<v Speaker 2>you just nailed it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just nailed it.</v>

2546
01:57:15.310 --> 01:57:18.850
<v Speaker 2>Those things change the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three of those fucking things change.</v>

2547
01:57:18.880 --> 01:57:22.390
<v Speaker 2>I mean change everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but those three were like the seed that</v>

2548
01:57:22.391 --> 01:57:27.391
<v Speaker 2>planted North America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They came over hand explosion and it</v>

2549
01:57:27.610 --> 01:57:31.750
<v Speaker 2>became the empire state building and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking Seattle Tower.</v>

2550
01:57:31.751 --> 01:57:33.930
<v Speaker 2>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tower evil.</v>

2551
01:57:34.080 --> 01:57:37.120
<v Speaker 2>The space needle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The space needle brought lots of murder.</v>

2552
01:57:37.270 --> 01:57:38.200
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>diseases,</v>

2553
01:57:38.560 --> 01:57:39.910
<v Speaker 2>lots of disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Genocide,</v>

2554
01:57:39.911 --> 01:57:40.721
<v Speaker 2>rape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2555
01:57:40.721 --> 01:57:43.270
<v Speaker 2>All sorts of groovy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

2556
01:57:43.271 --> 01:57:45.450
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy when you think about phones</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

2557
01:57:45.490 --> 01:57:47.550
<v Speaker 2>well eventually eventually turns into</v>
<v Speaker 2>iphone.</v>

2558
01:57:47.551 --> 01:57:49.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if my phones would have existed</v>

2559
01:57:49.181 --> 01:57:50.920
<v Speaker 2>if we just stayed in Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably not.</v>

2560
01:57:51.040 --> 01:57:51.970
<v Speaker 2>See that's what a think.</v>

2561
01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:56.050
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that I think is really</v>
<v Speaker 2>important about like having an asshole</v>

2562
01:57:56.290 --> 01:58:01.000
<v Speaker 2>as a president for a brief brief for us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have a chance to rethink this whole</v>

2563
01:58:01.001 --> 01:58:04.360
<v Speaker 2>thing is I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we have to get outraged before</v>

2564
01:58:04.361 --> 01:58:07.590
<v Speaker 2>things change and we have to realize</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the system is just fucking retard.</v>

2565
01:58:07.610 --> 01:58:09.730
<v Speaker 2>And maybe he does too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe look,</v>

2566
01:58:09.850 --> 01:58:11.710
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's give him the benefit of the doubt,</v>

2567
01:58:11.711 --> 01:58:12.860
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about a guy,</v>

2568
01:58:12.861 --> 01:58:15.880
<v Speaker 2>he's obviously incredibly wealthy and</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously incredibly successful.</v>

2569
01:58:16.240 --> 01:58:21.240
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he is sick of it all himself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he is one of the guys who's</v>

2570
01:58:21.251 --> 01:58:22.540
<v Speaker 2>actually contributed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2571
01:58:22.541 --> 01:58:23.351
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

2572
01:58:23.351 --> 01:58:26.080
<v Speaker 2>that fucking guy paid hillary to come to</v>
<v Speaker 2>his wedding.</v>

2573
01:58:26.320 --> 01:58:28.030
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hundreds of thousands of dollars.</v>

2574
01:58:28.031 --> 01:58:29.980
<v Speaker 2>It's all it took and she showed up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2575
01:58:30.130 --> 01:58:31.960
<v Speaker 2>this is a guy that's been deep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deep,</v>

2576
01:58:31.961 --> 01:58:33.400
<v Speaker 2>deep in the system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>handed out money,</v>

2577
01:58:33.401 --> 01:58:35.470
<v Speaker 2>these motherfuckers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then finally he went,</v>

2578
01:58:35.471 --> 01:58:36.340
<v Speaker 2>fuck you.</v>

2579

<v Speaker 2>fuck you.</v>

2580
01:58:38.110 --> 01:58:40.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to run this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>

2581
01:58:40.001 --> 01:58:42.130
<v Speaker 2>there's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's way Donald Trump,</v>

2582
01:58:42.131 --> 01:58:44.110
<v Speaker 2>we've looked at the numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Impossible.</v>

2583
01:58:44.440 --> 01:58:46.330
<v Speaker 2>Everybody else dropped out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've all given up.</v>

2584
01:58:46.450 --> 01:58:48.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton a</v>

2585
01:58:48.051 --> 01:58:48.940
<v Speaker 2>neck and neck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2586
01:58:48.970 --> 01:58:51.400
<v Speaker 2>Except for in delicates where she is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2587
01:58:51.520 --> 01:58:53.800
<v Speaker 2>quite a bit above him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she still doesn't have enough to</v>

2588
01:58:53.801 --> 01:58:55.920
<v Speaker 2>win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's close enough to,</v>

2589
01:58:55.921 --> 01:58:57.190
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's weird.</v>

2590
01:58:57.370 --> 01:59:00.760
<v Speaker 2>It's like weirdly close where you'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to look at it and you need people.</v>

2591
01:59:00.820 --> 01:59:02.790
<v Speaker 2>Bernie doesn't stand a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2592
01:59:03.040 --> 01:59:06.190
<v Speaker 2>mathematically he's already eliminated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then people say,</v>

2593
01:59:06.191 --> 01:59:08.020
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if Hillary gets indited for one of</v>

2594
01:59:08.021 --> 01:59:09.710
<v Speaker 2>the two criminal investigations?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sir,</v>

<v Speaker 2>what if people find out about this</v>

2596
01:59:13.841 --> 01:59:15.940
<v Speaker 2>fucking email thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's even worse than we thought.</v>

2597
01:59:16.150 --> 01:59:18.730
<v Speaker 2>What if people find out this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if they find out that what if</v>

2598
01:59:18.731 --> 01:59:19.390
<v Speaker 2>there's some dirt?</v>

2599
01:59:19.390 --> 01:59:20.780
<v Speaker 2>What if this isn't this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2600
01:59:20.810 --> 01:59:23.020
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking exhausting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's exhausting.</v>

2601
01:59:23.320 --> 01:59:27.310
<v Speaker 2>But meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this fucking trump guy is sitting pretty</v>

2602
01:59:27.430 --> 01:59:32.430
<v Speaker 2>just waiting for whoever gets most beat</v>
<v Speaker 2>up by this fucking campaign on the</v>

2603
01:59:34.211 --> 01:59:36.100
<v Speaker 2>democratic side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're beating the shit out of each</v>

2604
01:59:36.101 --> 01:59:38.020
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they're going to come through it.</v>

2605

<v Speaker 2>Whoever's going to come through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be all fucked up.</v>

2606
01:59:40.510 --> 01:59:42.140
<v Speaker 2>It's going to have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like having a,</v>

2607
01:59:42.141 --> 01:59:45.460
<v Speaker 2>an mma tournament.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One guy wins by a quick knockout in the</v>

2608
01:59:45.461 --> 01:59:46.250
<v Speaker 2>first round,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other way.</v>

2609
01:59:46.250 --> 01:59:51.250
<v Speaker 2>It goes through a three round war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trump just ran through someone Anderson</v>

2610
01:59:51.610 --> 01:59:56.610
<v Speaker 2>Silva Style and so now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so now like Hillary and fucking Bernie</v>

2612
01:59:59.010 --> 02:00:03.130
<v Speaker 2>he's beating the shit out of each other</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we have to wait to see who emerges.</v>

2613
02:00:03.490 --> 02:00:05.500
<v Speaker 2>Why don't screen strange,</v>
<v Speaker 2>strange time.</v>

2614
02:00:05.990 --> 02:00:08.300
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2615
02:00:08.360 --> 02:00:10.340
<v Speaker 4>like you said it and I've been thinking</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2616
02:00:10.370 --> 02:00:12.800
<v Speaker 4>You said it last week,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think when it was at the show about</v>

2617
02:00:12.801 --> 02:00:16.550
<v Speaker 4>you're more afraid of crews then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then he scares the shit out of me and</v>

2618
02:00:16.551 --> 02:00:17.570
<v Speaker 4>I'm glad he's out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2619
02:00:17.571 --> 02:00:18.210
<v Speaker 4>I'm glad he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

2620
02:00:18.210 --> 02:00:21.410
<v Speaker 4>he would have been the worst choice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And trump,</v>

2621
02:00:21.770 --> 02:00:26.770
<v Speaker 4>I have a feeling if he could fool people</v>
<v Speaker 4>and do this just to win that he might</v>

2622
02:00:28.790 --> 02:00:31.730
<v Speaker 4>actually just be doing it just to win.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's when you become a different</v>

2623
02:00:31.731 --> 02:00:32.580
<v Speaker 4>person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's our hope.</v>

2624
02:00:33.470 --> 02:00:35.900
<v Speaker 4>That's our hope.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if he did become a different person,</v>

2625
02:00:36.140 --> 02:00:39.350
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't even be surprised cause it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's Kinda almost typical him.</v>

2626
02:00:39.400 --> 02:00:40.490
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

2627
02:00:40.930 --> 02:00:41.651
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

2628
02:00:41.651 --> 02:00:43.330
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have any interaction with them.</v>

2629
02:00:43.331 --> 02:00:46.300
<v Speaker 2>But I do know that Jeff Ross work with</v>
<v Speaker 2>them on the roast and he said he was</v>

2630
02:00:46.301 --> 02:00:49.720
<v Speaker 2>very nice and very reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that Jeff Ross</v>

2631
02:00:49.721 --> 02:00:50.620
<v Speaker 2>said is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2632
02:00:50.621 --> 02:00:53.440
<v Speaker 2>when when the camera turns to you and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not laughing,</v>

2633
02:00:53.470 --> 02:00:56.800
<v Speaker 2>it kind of looks bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you should just enjoy it.</v>

2634
02:00:57.070 --> 02:01:00.040
<v Speaker 2>Like don't be upset that these guys are</v>
<v Speaker 2>making funny it just laugh along.</v>

2635
02:01:00.041 --> 02:01:01.750
<v Speaker 2>It'd be great for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

2636
02:01:01.751 --> 02:01:02.561
<v Speaker 2>trump thought about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

2637
02:01:02.561 --> 02:01:03.280
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>

2638
02:01:03.280 --> 02:01:05.980
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he's not an asshole all the time.</v>

2639
02:01:06.340 --> 02:01:09.340
<v Speaker 4>Character is definitely their character.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a wrestling character.</v>

2640
02:01:09.970 --> 02:01:11.310
<v Speaker 4>Wwe style.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

2643
02:01:14.261 --> 02:01:15.640
<v Speaker 2>I don't know him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2644
02:01:15.641 --> 02:01:18.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't buy any of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't buy Ryan seacrest's.</v>

2645
02:01:18.790 --> 02:01:20.800
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know Donald Trump.</v>

2646
02:01:20.860 --> 02:01:22.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would like to get high with Ryan</v>

2647
02:01:22.811 --> 02:01:24.730
<v Speaker 2>seacrest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Find what's really going on in there.</v>

2648
02:01:25.120 --> 02:01:26.800
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tell him to come on.</v>

2649
02:01:26.880 --> 02:01:30.130
<v Speaker 2>What you see what's in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's in his hand at cell phone.</v>

2650
02:01:30.660 --> 02:01:31.630
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going to shave his head.</v>

2651
02:01:32.260 --> 02:01:33.910
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The shaver.</v>

2652
02:01:33.950 --> 02:01:38.950
<v Speaker 2>But Vince Mcmahon areas as if it's like</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone's gonna be like,</v>

2653
02:01:39.320 --> 02:01:43.460
<v Speaker 2>are they shaved?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vince Mcmahon's head space was more</v>

2654
02:01:43.461 --> 02:01:45.890
<v Speaker 2>fearful than somebody's about to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>beheaded by Isis.</v>

2655
02:01:46.010 --> 02:01:48.890
<v Speaker 2>Is that Bobby Lashley?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's Bobby Lashley,</v>

2656
02:01:48.900 --> 02:01:50.600
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bobby Lashley is,</v>

2657
02:01:50.601 --> 02:01:55.601
<v Speaker 2>I'm fighting MMA now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has to fight and like these weird</v>

2658
02:01:56.451 --> 02:01:58.010
<v Speaker 2>Indian casinos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they don't test them.</v>

2659
02:01:58.380 --> 02:01:59.040
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>

2660
02:01:59.040 --> 02:02:03.690
<v Speaker 3>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's a rumor going around Joe.</v>

2661
02:02:03.890 --> 02:02:06.220
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw something the other day that a</v>

2662
02:02:06.300 --> 02:02:09.690
<v Speaker 3>floyd mayweather,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his team has been trademarking like</v>

2663
02:02:09.691 --> 02:02:12.810
<v Speaker 3>floyd 50 or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying that like he might be coming out</v>

2664
02:02:12.811 --> 02:02:14.010
<v Speaker 3>of retirement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2665
02:02:14.070 --> 02:02:19.070
<v Speaker 3>I heard about this rumor hit today that</v>
<v Speaker 3>has potential opponent might be connor</v>

2666
02:02:19.351 --> 02:02:21.420
<v Speaker 3>mcgregor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

2667
02:02:21.460 --> 02:02:25.050
<v Speaker 3>Had a boxing match at t mobile arena in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vegas.</v>

2668
02:02:25.200 --> 02:02:27.920
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2669
02:02:28.050 --> 02:02:30.720
<v Speaker 2>I think conor mcgregor is a very good</v>
<v Speaker 2>mma fighter.</v>

2670
02:02:31.080 --> 02:02:34.890
<v Speaker 2>I think if conor mcgregor and floyd</v>
<v Speaker 2>mayweather fight in mma,</v>

2671
02:02:34.920 --> 02:02:38.730
<v Speaker 2>conor mcgregor will fuck him up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He will fuck him up.</v>

2672
02:02:38.910 --> 02:02:40.890
<v Speaker 2>Floyd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll get the shit kicked out of him.</v>

2673
02:02:40.891 --> 02:02:45.000
<v Speaker 2>He will kick his fucking body senseless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He will kick his legs.</v>

2674
02:02:45.240 --> 02:02:48.390
<v Speaker 2>Floyd will be debilitated inside of one</v>
<v Speaker 2>round,</v>

2675
02:02:48.400 --> 02:02:50.520
<v Speaker 2>100%.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if connor decides to take him to the</v>

2676
02:02:50.521 --> 02:02:53.100
<v Speaker 2>ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guarantee you floyd mayweather,</v>

2677
02:02:53.430 --> 02:02:56.400
<v Speaker 2>conner's no worldclass wrestler,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's no ncaa champion.</v>

2678
02:02:56.401 --> 02:03:00.050
<v Speaker 2>He's an Olympic gold medalist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guarantee you floyd mayweather cannot</v>

2679
02:03:00.060 --> 02:03:02.730
<v Speaker 2>stop him from taking them to the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if connor gets him to the ground,</v>

2680
02:03:02.731 --> 02:03:06.690
<v Speaker 2>he's going to mount them and cave his</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking face in or choke him or break</v>

2681
02:03:06.691 --> 02:03:11.310
<v Speaker 2>his arm or do whatever he wants to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in a boxing match,</v>

2682
02:03:12.660 --> 02:03:16.870
<v Speaker 2>I can't imagine highlight world were</v>
<v Speaker 2>floyd mayweather.</v>

2683
02:03:16.870 --> 02:03:19.440
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't fuck him up in a boxing</v>
<v Speaker 2>match.</v>

2684
02:03:19.441 --> 02:03:24.060
<v Speaker 2>I think floyd mayweather is arguably the</v>
<v Speaker 2>greatest boxer of all time.</v>

2685
02:03:24.330 --> 02:03:27.150
<v Speaker 2>If you look at his accomplishments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who he's been able to beat,</v>

2686
02:03:27.151 --> 02:03:31.680
<v Speaker 2>how he shuts everyone's offense down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a more boring version of what a lot</v>

2687
02:03:31.681 --> 02:03:35.550
<v Speaker 2>of Bernard Hopkins does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he does it in a more slick,</v>

2688
02:03:35.640 --> 02:03:40.640
<v Speaker 2>skillful way with rapid reflexes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he relies on speed and movement and</v>

2689
02:03:40.800 --> 02:03:41.970
<v Speaker 2>just a deep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deep,</v>

2690
02:03:41.971 --> 02:03:45.360
<v Speaker 2>deep understanding of boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just so much better.</v>

2691
02:03:45.600 --> 02:03:48.390
<v Speaker 2>And if people don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you think you're really good and then</v>

2692
02:03:48.391 --> 02:03:50.100
<v Speaker 2>you get in there and you box a guy like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2693
02:03:50.460 --> 02:03:52.380
<v Speaker 2>he will fucking expose the shit out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

2694
02:03:52.590 --> 02:03:55.320
<v Speaker 2>He will expose the shit out of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

2695
02:03:55.321 --> 02:03:56.730
<v Speaker 2>it's a different animal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2696
02:03:56.760 --> 02:03:57.391
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows,</v>

2697
02:03:57.391 --> 02:03:58.230
<v Speaker 2>man?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

2698
02:03:58.470 --> 02:04:01.680
<v Speaker 2>one of the things we know about connor</v>
<v Speaker 2>is he has a ridiculous belief in himself</v>

2699
02:04:01.681 --> 02:04:03.210
<v Speaker 2>and he has unbelievable power.</v>

2700
02:04:03.690 --> 02:04:08.340
<v Speaker 2>One of the things we know about floyd is</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's 39 I think is that old.</v>

2701
02:04:08.350 --> 02:04:12.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when a guy turns 39 you never know.</v>

2702
02:04:12.870 --> 02:04:13.321
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

2703
02:04:13.321 --> 02:04:17.040
<v Speaker 2>for every guy like Bernard Hopkins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a bunch of guys who the wheels</v>

2704
02:04:17.041 --> 02:04:19.980
<v Speaker 2>just fall off and all of a sudden they</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't take a punch anymore and they</v>

2705
02:04:19.981 --> 02:04:21.960
<v Speaker 2>can't fight anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't move good anymore.</v>

2706
02:04:22.620 --> 02:04:27.480
<v Speaker 2>But I can't imagine a world where he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>not light years past connor with boxing</v>

2707
02:04:27.481 --> 02:04:28.314
<v Speaker 2>skill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could just,</v>

2708
02:04:28.350 --> 02:04:30.540
<v Speaker 2>it's there nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These guys are thinking about money.</v>

2709
02:04:30.840 --> 02:04:32.280
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>More than,</v>

2710
02:04:32.550 --> 02:04:35.340
<v Speaker 2>more than like a result.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The money will be giant.</v>

2711
02:04:36.080 --> 02:04:37.830
<v Speaker 2>They'd probably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they probably out a way,</v>

2712
02:04:37.890 --> 02:04:39.840
<v Speaker 2>we're both of them don't lose or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

2713
02:04:39.990 --> 02:04:42.360
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they're going to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're going to really fight.</v>

2714
02:04:42.720 --> 02:04:43.321
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

2715
02:04:43.321 --> 02:04:45.150
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't imagine that in either one of</v>

2716
02:04:45.151 --> 02:04:48.720
<v Speaker 2>them would be willing to negotiate with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other one while thinking that they</v>

2717
02:04:48.721 --> 02:04:49.950
<v Speaker 2>might get double crossed.</v>

2718
02:04:50.300 --> 02:04:51.510
<v Speaker 2>You know like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nah,</v>

2719
02:04:51.600 --> 02:04:54.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't buy that because remember what</v>
<v Speaker 2>Victor Ortiz and mayweather,</v>

2720
02:04:54.750 --> 02:04:59.370
<v Speaker 2>when Victor Ortiz was doing some dirty</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit to mayweather and Victor Ortiz</v>

2721
02:04:59.371 --> 02:05:02.580
<v Speaker 2>apologized and floyd mayweather just</v>
<v Speaker 2>step to him and sucker punched him in</v>

2722
02:05:02.581 --> 02:05:03.660
<v Speaker 2>the face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Klm.</v>

2723
02:05:03.840 --> 02:05:05.910
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Watch this here.</v>

2724
02:05:05.911 --> 02:05:07.170
<v Speaker 2>Pull.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pull that up because it's kind of</v>

2725
02:05:07.171 --> 02:05:12.171
<v Speaker 2>hilarious cause like there's no deals</v>
<v Speaker 2>being made and not in this world.</v>

2726
02:05:12.301 --> 02:05:16.920
<v Speaker 2>This is the world of competitive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm only saying that because why should</v>

2727
02:05:17.030 --> 02:05:21.060
<v Speaker 2>the MMA guy watch this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Victoria [inaudible] gets warned because</v>

2728
02:05:21.061 --> 02:05:25.590
<v Speaker 2>he kept like headbutting and like</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting really dirty and so he goes to</v>

2729
02:05:25.740 --> 02:05:26.910
<v Speaker 2>touch hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at this.</v>

2730
02:05:28.020 --> 02:05:31.260
<v Speaker 2>Boom Bang.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes to touch hands like Yo,</v>

2731
02:05:31.261 --> 02:05:31.951
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

2732
02:05:31.951 --> 02:05:33.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bing Bang.</v>

2733
02:05:33.870 --> 02:05:36.960
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's hilarious.</v>

2734
02:05:37.440 --> 02:05:40.890
<v Speaker 2>That's the real world of boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mayweather just knocked him the fuck</v>

2735
02:05:40.891 --> 02:05:42.180
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just,</v>

2736
02:05:42.210 --> 02:05:45.540
<v Speaker 2>he thought they were going to like touch</v>
<v Speaker 2>gloves and be buddies and then get back</v>

2737
02:05:45.541 --> 02:05:48.000
<v Speaker 2>after it and maybe where there's like</v>
<v Speaker 2>bitch pop.</v>

2738
02:05:48.030 --> 02:05:50.430
<v Speaker 2>He hit him with a left hook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They never saw a common straight right</v>

2739
02:05:50.431 --> 02:05:51.720
<v Speaker 2>hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a wrap.</v>

2740
02:05:52.320 --> 02:05:57.320
<v Speaker 2>And I just think that the skill level in</v>
<v Speaker 2>straight boxing that floyd mayweather</v>

2741
02:05:58.351 --> 02:06:00.720
<v Speaker 2>has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very difficult to understand why</v>

2742
02:06:00.721 --> 02:06:01.560
<v Speaker 2>you're just looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2743
02:06:01.561 --> 02:06:04.530
<v Speaker 2>he's touching them here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at this being bitch.</v>

2744
02:06:05.310 --> 02:06:09.660
<v Speaker 2>He even had a bitch lips or is looking</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the rest face like bitch even it's</v>

2745
02:06:09.661 --> 02:06:12.480
<v Speaker 2>like even said bitch Bam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2746
02:06:12.720 --> 02:06:15.300
<v Speaker 2>look at this bank June.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

2747
02:06:15.301 --> 02:06:16.710
<v Speaker 2>what is he doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boom,</v>

2748
02:06:16.950 --> 02:06:20.880
<v Speaker 2>that's a wrap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was a wrap for Victoria teases</v>

2749
02:06:20.881 --> 02:06:22.050
<v Speaker 2>career.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really essentially.</v>

2750
02:06:22.160 --> 02:06:24.840
<v Speaker 2>Is there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there another fight to bring floyd</v>

2751
02:06:24.841 --> 02:06:27.110
<v Speaker 2>out of retirement that is short</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pacquiao.</v>

2752
02:06:27.111 --> 02:06:29.470
<v Speaker 2>Pacquiao was the big fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially since packet.</v>

2753
02:06:29.471 --> 02:06:33.600
<v Speaker 2>I'll just beat Timothy Bradley if</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pacquiao decided to,</v>

2754
02:06:33.620 --> 02:06:34.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really ramp it up.</v>

2755
02:06:34.681 --> 02:06:37.920
<v Speaker 2>I think he still can get a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 2>excited about them.</v>

2756
02:06:38.100 --> 02:06:39.510
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had a shoulder injury,</v>

2757
02:06:39.540 --> 02:06:41.550
<v Speaker 2>he had a shoulder repaired,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but obviously it was great.</v>

2758
02:06:41.551 --> 02:06:43.580
<v Speaker 2>And the Bradley fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he looked awesome and the Bradley fight,</v>

2759
02:06:43.740 --> 02:06:45.690
<v Speaker 2>he's a beast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that could be a real fight,</v>

2760
02:06:46.020 --> 02:06:49.620
<v Speaker 2>but I also think that floyd mayweather</v>
<v Speaker 2>versus connor would generate insane</v>

2761
02:06:49.621 --> 02:06:51.360
<v Speaker 2>amounts of money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Insane.</v>

2762
02:06:51.361 --> 02:06:55.470
<v Speaker 2>But just be fun to watch the 24 seven</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would make great tv.</v>

2763
02:06:55.830 --> 02:06:56.760
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

2764
02:06:56.790 --> 02:06:59.220
<v Speaker 2>who fucking knows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so though.</v>

2765
02:06:59.221 --> 02:07:02.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine unless the UFC is</v>

2766
02:07:02.311 --> 02:07:04.510
<v Speaker 2>involved at have to let them out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>contract.</v>

2767
02:07:04.970 --> 02:07:06.750
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't,</v>

2768
02:07:06.751 --> 02:07:09.810
<v Speaker 2>I can't imagine that they would be</v>
<v Speaker 2>willing to do that and I can't imagine</v>

2769
02:07:09.811 --> 02:07:12.000
<v Speaker 2>that they would let him fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Floyd Mayweather,</v>

2770
02:07:12.360 --> 02:07:16.320
<v Speaker 2>like Dana and Lorenzo and frank are</v>
<v Speaker 2>serious boxing fanatics.</v>

2771
02:07:16.380 --> 02:07:19.440
<v Speaker 2>They know a lot about boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could there be a cross promotion?</v>

2772
02:07:19.770 --> 02:07:20.190
<v Speaker 2>Oh Man.</v>

2773
02:07:20.190 --> 02:07:21.500
<v Speaker 2>I said I'm waiting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like have the fight on it.</v>

2774
02:07:21.520 --> 02:07:25.910
<v Speaker 2>You can get a piece could happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I wouldn't throw a fighter to the</v>

2775
02:07:25.911 --> 02:07:27.750
<v Speaker 2>lions like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I just,</v>

2776
02:07:27.810 --> 02:07:30.420
<v Speaker 2>I just don't look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could be wrong.</v>

2777
02:07:30.910 --> 02:07:32.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm no fucking</v>

2778
02:07:34.380 --> 02:07:36.400
<v Speaker 2>clairvoyant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really know what's going to</v>

2779
02:07:36.401 --> 02:07:39.850
<v Speaker 2>happen in a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think mayweather is a ghost.</v>

2780
02:07:40.240 --> 02:07:42.940
<v Speaker 2>I think you go to punch where mayweather</v>
<v Speaker 2>is and it may,</v>

2781
02:07:42.941 --> 02:07:46.810
<v Speaker 2>well there's not there anymore and he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>popping you a jabs and slowly getting</v>

2782
02:07:46.811 --> 02:07:49.660
<v Speaker 2>you frustrated and setting traps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the next thing you know,</v>

2783
02:07:49.661 --> 02:07:52.000
<v Speaker 2>he's uncorking shots on you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who the fuck knows?</v>

2784
02:07:52.210 --> 02:07:54.430
<v Speaker 2>But who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe conor Mcgregor,</v>

2785
02:07:54.431 --> 02:07:57.580
<v Speaker 2>if you went to straight boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would be even more successful than he</v>

2786
02:07:57.581 --> 02:08:01.660
<v Speaker 2>has as an MMA fighter because his best</v>
<v Speaker 2>knockouts where with punches,</v>

2787
02:08:01.810 --> 02:08:04.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean his left hand is a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>piston.</v>

2788
02:08:04.451 --> 02:08:07.480
<v Speaker 2>He has a nasty lefthand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he fucks a lot of guys up.</v>

2789
02:08:07.630 --> 02:08:12.630
<v Speaker 2>But is he fucking guys up that are just</v>
<v Speaker 2>not at the level of boxing as say a</v>

2790
02:08:12.641 --> 02:08:16.840
<v Speaker 2>Timothy Bradley or uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my Donna or you know,</v>

2791
02:08:16.870 --> 02:08:20.370
<v Speaker 2>wineman male marcus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guys who use though and the,</v>

2792
02:08:20.380 --> 02:08:24.730
<v Speaker 2>and the and they're distracted by</v>
<v Speaker 2>training other types of things.</v>

2793
02:08:24.731 --> 02:08:25.481
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

2794
02:08:25.481 --> 02:08:25.920
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2795
02:08:25.920 --> 02:08:29.000
<v Speaker 2>For the ground game for Muay Thai,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2796
02:08:29.060 --> 02:08:30.370
<v Speaker 2>it's like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2797
02:08:30.700 --> 02:08:35.080
<v Speaker 2>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe whether it's just focus on hands.</v>

2798
02:08:35.110 --> 02:08:36.310
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

2799
02:08:36.480 --> 02:08:39.040
<v Speaker 2>And he's a master at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a straight up master.</v>

2800
02:08:39.540 --> 02:08:41.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm in an MMA fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wouldn't even be close.</v>

2801
02:08:41.400 --> 02:08:42.640
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would not even be close.</v>

2802
02:08:42.641 --> 02:08:45.110
<v Speaker 2>Connor would kick his body apart before</v>
<v Speaker 2>it may,</v>

2803
02:08:45.111 --> 02:08:48.220
<v Speaker 2>whether they even got close to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think his understanding of the</v>

2804
02:08:48.221 --> 02:08:49.500
<v Speaker 2>distance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no way maybe,</v>

2805
02:08:49.560 --> 02:08:51.010
<v Speaker 2>maybe they would understand the</v>
<v Speaker 2>distance.</v>

2806
02:08:51.400 --> 02:08:53.530
<v Speaker 2>Connor would hit him with spinning back</v>
<v Speaker 2>kick to the body,</v>

2807
02:08:53.531 --> 02:08:55.810
<v Speaker 2>may with a crumble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Connor would need them in the body in</v>

2808
02:08:55.811 --> 02:08:56.290
<v Speaker 2>the clinch.</v>

2809
02:08:56.290 --> 02:08:57.670
<v Speaker 2>It would be awful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would kill him.</v>

2810
02:08:58.030 --> 02:09:01.420
<v Speaker 2>He would kill them in an MMA fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's much bigger to kind of really</v>

2811
02:09:01.421 --> 02:09:03.850
<v Speaker 2>struggles to get done in one 45.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a big fuck,</v>

2812
02:09:04.450 --> 02:09:06.280
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I just think in the MMA fight it</v>

2813
02:09:06.281 --> 02:09:09.670
<v Speaker 2>would be disastrous for me whether,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it could be equally disastrous in a</v>

2814
02:09:09.671 --> 02:09:11.210
<v Speaker 2>boxing fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have comical way.</v>

2815
02:09:11.211 --> 02:09:13.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only thing that makes me think that</v>

2816
02:09:13.870 --> 02:09:17.740
<v Speaker 2>maybe connor could survive as he's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking super dangerous punch or just</v>

2817
02:09:17.741 --> 02:09:20.130
<v Speaker 2>like my Donna was or my don is over</v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

2818
02:09:20.200 --> 02:09:22.180
<v Speaker 2>Even though my dad is a worldclass</v>
<v Speaker 2>boxer,</v>

2819
02:09:22.270 --> 02:09:23.590
<v Speaker 2>my don is the guy who beat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2820
02:09:23.591 --> 02:09:26.860
<v Speaker 2>Adrian broner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My Donna's a serious vicious p power</v>

2821
02:09:26.861 --> 02:09:30.610
<v Speaker 2>puncher and he's real aggressive and</v>
<v Speaker 2>wild makes me think like,</v>

2822
02:09:30.611 --> 02:09:33.450
<v Speaker 2>maybe like if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he,</v>

2823
02:09:33.480 --> 02:09:36.450
<v Speaker 2>if connor went straight into boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe he could have been a worldclass</v>

2824
02:09:36.460 --> 02:09:36.940
<v Speaker 2>boxer.</v>

2825
02:09:36.940 --> 02:09:38.680
<v Speaker 2>Maybe could have been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2826
02:09:38.710 --> 02:09:42.190
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some real ricky Hatton type challenger</v>

2827
02:09:42.460 --> 02:09:45.370
<v Speaker 2>entirely possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But even ricky Hatton got fucked up.</v>

2828
02:09:45.371 --> 02:09:49.300
<v Speaker 2>I may weatherman when Ricky Hatton was</v>
<v Speaker 2>ricky Hatton when he was in his prime.</v>

2829
02:09:49.510 --> 02:09:51.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't think rick and he hadn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should have quit after that fight.</v>

2830
02:09:52.500 --> 02:09:53.860
<v Speaker 2>A man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He likes to do blow.</v>

2831
02:09:54.290 --> 02:09:56.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm wanting to get fat.</v>

2832
02:09:56.350 --> 02:09:58.570
<v Speaker 2>It was having a party defendant duplo</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2833
02:09:58.571 --> 02:09:59.021
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2834
02:09:59.021 --> 02:10:02.170
<v Speaker 2>he did have one comeback fight and just</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't like how he performed and I think</v>

2835
02:10:02.171 --> 02:10:04.960
<v Speaker 2>he actually wound up winning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he decided that it was over,</v>

2836
02:10:05.050 --> 02:10:08.260
<v Speaker 2>that he lost it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm got to beat out of him.</v>

2837
02:10:09.220 --> 02:10:10.990
<v Speaker 2>It could be that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it also could be,</v>

2838
02:10:11.020 --> 02:10:12.760
<v Speaker 2>we'll pack you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll really fucked him up.</v>

2839
02:10:12.950 --> 02:10:14.250
<v Speaker 2>Pankey out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hurt him bad.</v>

2840
02:10:14.260 --> 02:10:16.070
<v Speaker 2>We're pack out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>knocked him out and he knocked them</v>

2841
02:10:16.071 --> 02:10:17.050
<v Speaker 2>dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

2842
02:10:17.120 --> 02:10:18.010
<v Speaker 2>Mayweather.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucked him up.</v>

2843
02:10:18.160 --> 02:10:19.960
<v Speaker 2>But when packout fucked him up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>

2844
02:10:19.961 --> 02:10:22.280
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a bad knock out man.</v>

2845
02:10:22.290 --> 02:10:26.140
<v Speaker 2>He's got those gigantic tree trunk legs</v>
<v Speaker 2>those spring.</v>

2846
02:10:26.320 --> 02:10:29.350
<v Speaker 2>He's got a calf.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His calf muscles are like four by four</v>

2847
02:10:29.351 --> 02:10:30.460
<v Speaker 2>springs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just,</v>

2848
02:10:31.510 --> 02:10:34.670
<v Speaker 2>he just jumps at you and uncorked left</v>
<v Speaker 2>hand on your chin.</v>

2849
02:10:35.060 --> 02:10:37.820
<v Speaker 2>And when he did that to Ricky Hatton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just went to sleep.</v>

2850
02:10:38.380 --> 02:10:41.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like the second I British like</v>

2851
02:10:41.530 --> 02:10:44.950
<v Speaker 1>hope that that happened to like cleaning</v>
<v Speaker 1>up in Europe and then they came out</v>

2852
02:10:44.951 --> 02:10:47.830
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a prince knows any Mohamad</v>

2853
02:10:47.830 --> 02:10:48.730
<v Speaker 1>Mohamad yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2854
02:10:49.950 --> 02:10:54.950
<v Speaker 1>I seen my Hammad got exposed by um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fuck is his name?</v>

2855
02:10:56.980 --> 02:11:01.670
<v Speaker 1>A guy who was in a series of wars with</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

2856
02:11:01.870 --> 02:11:03.150
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't pernell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whitaker was,</v>

2857
02:11:03.151 --> 02:11:03.381
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2858
02:11:03.381 --> 02:11:04.030
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2859
02:11:04.030 --> 02:11:05.230
<v Speaker 1>Who is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexican gentlemen.</v>

2860
02:11:05.290 --> 02:11:06.390
<v Speaker 1>Marcos Berrera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2861
02:11:06.410 --> 02:11:08.000
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marcos Antonio.</v>

2862
02:11:08.010 --> 02:11:09.820
<v Speaker 1>Berrera yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2863
02:11:09.880 --> 02:11:11.410
<v Speaker 1>That's what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2864
02:11:11.440 --> 02:11:14.560
<v Speaker 1>he exposed him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he showed that fundamental boxing at the</v>

2865
02:11:14.561 --> 02:11:18.730
<v Speaker 1>highest level is going to beat that</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy jumping in wild shit.</v>

2866
02:11:18.760 --> 02:11:21.400
<v Speaker 1>Like wild shit didn't work on the top</v>
<v Speaker 1>level guys.</v>

2867
02:11:21.910 --> 02:11:23.680
<v Speaker 1>And so he got kind of exposed in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

2868
02:11:24.580 --> 02:11:25.413
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

2869
02:11:25.830 --> 02:11:30.180
<v Speaker 2>you know what man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boxing is so it's so specialized and the</v>

2870
02:11:30.181 --> 02:11:32.940
<v Speaker 2>guys that are really good and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

2871
02:11:32.941 --> 02:11:34.410
<v Speaker 2>really good guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2872
02:11:34.590 --> 02:11:36.180
<v Speaker 2>they're underrated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How good they are.</v>

2873
02:11:36.181 --> 02:11:38.670
<v Speaker 2>And like as a person who's watching it</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the outside,</v>

2874
02:11:39.030 --> 02:11:41.250
<v Speaker 2>you don't understand how good a guy like</v>
<v Speaker 2>mayweather is.</v>

2875
02:11:41.251 --> 02:11:44.670
<v Speaker 2>I think unless you're there with him</v>
<v Speaker 2>while he's doing his stuff.</v>

2876
02:11:45.150 --> 02:11:48.450
<v Speaker 2>Like I bet if a guy's boxing him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet that's when you get a real</v>

2877
02:11:48.451 --> 02:11:48.720
<v Speaker 2>understood</v>

2878
02:11:48.720 --> 02:11:51.270
<v Speaker 1>standing of how good he is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's disciplined too.</v>

2879
02:11:51.271 --> 02:11:53.790
<v Speaker 1>He's more disciplined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any acts on the outside like,</v>

2880
02:11:54.210 --> 02:11:56.850
<v Speaker 1>like uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I used to hang out with Kevin Hart</v>

2881
02:11:56.851 --> 02:11:59.200
<v Speaker 1>a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he used to hang out with mayweather and</v>

2882
02:11:59.210 --> 02:12:00.970
<v Speaker 1>said they'd be partying in the middle of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pause.</v>

2883
02:12:01.030 --> 02:12:03.600
<v Speaker 1>I gotta go and it's like three in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>morning.</v>

2884
02:12:03.601 --> 02:12:05.940
<v Speaker 1>I've got to go to road work and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>just go run.</v>

2885
02:12:06.330 --> 02:12:08.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And bring the car and then run it.</v>

2886
02:12:08.350 --> 02:12:09.290
<v Speaker 1>And jeans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2887
02:12:09.660 --> 02:12:11.040
<v Speaker 1>Just says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just follow me.</v>

2888
02:12:11.300 --> 02:12:12.590
<v Speaker 1>And he goes running.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2889
02:12:12.750 --> 02:12:16.830
<v Speaker 1>Well he's in tremendous shape always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But apparently now he's a,</v>

2890
02:12:17.260 --> 02:12:18.610
<v Speaker 2>he's a little heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

2891
02:12:18.611 --> 02:12:19.390
<v Speaker 2>who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2892
02:12:19.390 --> 02:12:21.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean if enough money gets thrown in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the UFC is direction,</v>

2893
02:12:21.701 --> 02:12:23.620
<v Speaker 2>the UFC might look at it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's a,</v>

2894
02:12:23.650 --> 02:12:26.380
<v Speaker 2>here's a pragmatic way of looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can still make a lot of money with</v>

2895
02:12:26.381 --> 02:12:27.320
<v Speaker 2>conor Mcgregor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2896
02:12:27.580 --> 02:12:30.130
<v Speaker 2>Still make a lot of money with conor</v>
<v Speaker 2>mcgregor in an MMA fight.</v>

2897
02:12:30.610 --> 02:12:33.340
<v Speaker 2>We can still make a lot of money if</v>
<v Speaker 2>connor rematches,</v>

2898
02:12:33.341 --> 02:12:34.660
<v Speaker 2>Nate Diaz,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which uh,</v>

2899
02:12:34.661 --> 02:12:36.610
<v Speaker 2>I hear they're trying to make happen as</v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

2900
02:12:36.611 --> 02:12:41.611
<v Speaker 2>That's what the rumor been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But is he going to beat the best guys in</v>

2901
02:12:41.861 --> 02:12:45.190
<v Speaker 2>the world now after Nate Diaz boxed them</v>
<v Speaker 2>up and choked him out?</v>

2902
02:12:45.310 --> 02:12:49.090
<v Speaker 2>Like are is that going to happen again?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if that does happen again,</v>

2903
02:12:49.240 --> 02:12:52.450
<v Speaker 2>how much will that deflate his value on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the open market?</v>

2904
02:12:52.451 --> 02:12:55.840
<v Speaker 2>If you're playing a game of chess now</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at as terms of a guys career as</v>

2905
02:12:55.841 --> 02:12:58.840
<v Speaker 2>an MMA fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but looking at it as a game of financial</v>

2906
02:12:58.841 --> 02:13:00.880
<v Speaker 2>chess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you move your piece?</v>

2907
02:13:01.300 --> 02:13:02.081
<v Speaker 2>You might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2908
02:13:02.081 --> 02:13:03.690
<v Speaker 2>the amount of money that you can make</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the main,</v>

2909
02:13:03.691 --> 02:13:06.520
<v Speaker 2>where their fight is off the charts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2910
02:13:06.610 --> 02:13:09.730
<v Speaker 2>Right off the charts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're talking about like a 3 million</v>

2911
02:13:09.760 --> 02:13:12.550
<v Speaker 2>paper view by or something crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you do that,</v>

2912
02:13:12.940 --> 02:13:16.420
<v Speaker 2>you move that up and you take that</v>
<v Speaker 2>chance and he gets boxed up by</v>

2913
02:13:16.421 --> 02:13:17.630
<v Speaker 2>mayweather.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2914
02:13:17.631 --> 02:13:19.960
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe survives if he survives and loses</v>

2915
02:13:19.961 --> 02:13:22.270
<v Speaker 2>it fucking decision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he goes back and he says,</v>

2916
02:13:22.271 --> 02:13:23.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all respect to mayweather,</v>

2917
02:13:23.960 --> 02:13:25.840
<v Speaker 2>going back to mma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2918
02:13:25.841 --> 02:13:27.400
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't understand his hands.</v>

2919
02:13:27.401 --> 02:13:30.190
<v Speaker 2>Now it's a learning experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2920
02:13:30.191 --> 02:13:32.460
<v Speaker 2>and he has this great conference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he could survive,</v>

2921
02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:36.030
<v Speaker 2>he's not diminished too much and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's not like a murderous</v>

2922
02:13:36.031 --> 02:13:38.580
<v Speaker 2>puncher,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not like a Canelo Alvarez or</v>

2923
02:13:38.581 --> 02:13:41.910
<v Speaker 2>Gennady Golovkin Lufkin Golovkin is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad fight for him.</v>

2924
02:13:42.060 --> 02:13:45.510
<v Speaker 2>Someone like that's a bad fight for him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a murderous puncher because most likely</v>

2925
02:13:45.511 --> 02:13:46.344
<v Speaker 2>they're going to take them out.</v>

2926
02:13:46.480 --> 02:13:48.480
<v Speaker 2>But May,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's very possible he's going to</v>

2927
02:13:48.481 --> 02:13:51.000
<v Speaker 2>get to the decision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>39 is perfect age.</v>

2928
02:13:51.060 --> 02:13:53.070
<v Speaker 2>It's good angel it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

2929
02:13:53.071 --> 02:13:54.690
<v Speaker 2>if I was in his corner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>

2930
02:13:54.750 --> 02:13:56.070
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this can be done.</v>

2931
02:13:56.250 --> 02:13:58.380
<v Speaker 2>This can be done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it feels like Mcgregor wants to get</v>

2932
02:13:58.381 --> 02:14:03.381
<v Speaker 2>paid because he quit threatened to quit</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he wants to get paid more money.</v>

2933
02:14:04.370 --> 02:14:04.850
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2934
02:14:04.850 --> 02:14:07.470
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He really didn't threaten to quit.</v>

2935
02:14:07.620 --> 02:14:10.230
<v Speaker 2>He didn't want to do as he did want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do any of the press conferences.</v>

2936
02:14:10.260 --> 02:14:11.070
<v Speaker 2>So he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he made,</v>

2937
02:14:11.070 --> 02:14:13.260
<v Speaker 2>he called the UFC bluff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

2938
02:14:13.261 --> 02:14:15.570
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to remove me from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>car and I'm fucking conor Mcgregor.</v>

2939
02:14:15.571 --> 02:14:17.010
<v Speaker 2>I call the shots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the UFC is like,</v>

2940
02:14:17.160 --> 02:14:18.180
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2941
02:14:18.540 --> 02:14:21.120
<v Speaker 2>well we're going to cancel your fight so</v>
<v Speaker 2>take care.</v>

2942
02:14:21.390 --> 02:14:22.161
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2943
02:14:22.161 --> 02:14:24.810
<v Speaker 2>they had like a long break where they</v>
<v Speaker 2>weren't even talking back and forth to</v>

2944
02:14:24.811 --> 02:14:25.830
<v Speaker 2>each other and Dana was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nope,</v>

2945
02:14:25.890 --> 02:14:26.723
<v Speaker 2>I haven't talked to him.</v>

2946
02:14:26.920 --> 02:14:28.330
<v Speaker 2>He's not off I zone in the fight</v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

2947
02:14:28.331 --> 02:14:30.780
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't the press conference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're just going to move on with the UFC</v>

2948
02:14:30.781 --> 02:14:34.530
<v Speaker 2>200 and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>UFC 200 is about the sport in their</v>

2949
02:14:34.531 --> 02:14:35.720
<v Speaker 2>eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all about sport.</v>

2950
02:14:36.010 --> 02:14:37.380
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it's also,</v>

2951
02:14:37.920 --> 02:14:40.800
<v Speaker 2>it's an honor to be on that card.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a historical car.</v>

2952
02:14:40.801 --> 02:14:45.510
<v Speaker 2>Just like UFC 100 was a historical card.</v>
<v Speaker 2>UFC 200 is an absolutely historical card</v>

2953
02:14:45.690 --> 02:14:48.600
<v Speaker 2>and at one guy can't hold it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter if you conor mcgregor</v>

2954
02:14:48.601 --> 02:14:51.720
<v Speaker 2>or Ronda Rousey or it doesn't matter</v>
<v Speaker 2>what kind of a superstar you are.</v>

2955
02:14:51.740 --> 02:14:54.330
<v Speaker 2>You can't hold up the UFC 200 cars and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to do the press.</v>

2956
02:14:54.480 --> 02:14:56.400
<v Speaker 2>So that was their position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They took a stand.</v>

2957
02:14:56.790 --> 02:14:59.470
<v Speaker 2>And so now he's in this position where</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got to figure out what the fuck is</v>

2958
02:14:59.530 --> 02:15:01.050
<v Speaker 2>gonna do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's gonna Fight Mayweather.</v>

2959
02:15:01.590 --> 02:15:02.400
<v Speaker 2>If that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2960
02:15:02.400 --> 02:15:03.630
<v Speaker 2>He can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

2961
02:15:03.631 --> 02:15:05.700
<v Speaker 2>I believe he would need the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His blessing.</v>

2962
02:15:05.701 --> 02:15:07.590
<v Speaker 2>I don't see another one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't see a world.</v>

2963
02:15:07.591 --> 02:15:10.590
<v Speaker 2>I can't imagine a world in which he</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't need the UFC is blessing.</v>

2964
02:15:11.310 --> 02:15:13.080
<v Speaker 2>What's Rousey's playing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's she doing now?</v>

2965
02:15:13.470 --> 02:15:14.910
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to talk to her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2966
02:15:14.970 --> 02:15:16.690
<v Speaker 2>kind of a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the,</v>

2967
02:15:16.760 --> 02:15:19.590
<v Speaker 2>the type of champion that she was as</v>
<v Speaker 2>good as she was,</v>

2968
02:15:19.591 --> 02:15:21.460
<v Speaker 2>as much as she dominated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2969
02:15:21.510 --> 02:15:23.460
<v Speaker 2>I can't imagine that she's not going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do it again.</v>

2970
02:15:23.500 --> 02:15:25.200
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't imagine that one fight.</v>

2971
02:15:25.320 --> 02:15:29.160
<v Speaker 2>We'll set her back that much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she also has massive amounts of</v>

2972
02:15:29.161 --> 02:15:32.430
<v Speaker 2>distractions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She has a huge career in movies.</v>

2973
02:15:32.580 --> 02:15:37.320
<v Speaker 2>She's doing giant movies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's wanted for commercials and this</v>

2974
02:15:37.321 --> 02:15:38.700
<v Speaker 2>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she's got two book.</v>

2975
02:15:38.760 --> 02:15:39.520
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck yeah,</v>

2976
02:15:39.520 --> 02:15:40.530
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's a superstar.</v>

2977
02:15:40.890 --> 02:15:45.060
<v Speaker 2>She's a superstar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But does it haunt her that a girl that</v>

2978
02:15:45.061 --> 02:15:47.850
<v Speaker 2>she beat twice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Misha tate has the belt,</v>

2979
02:15:47.851 --> 02:15:50.530
<v Speaker 2>but he's the champion right now and was</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking shit about her yesterday.</v>

2980
02:15:54.230 --> 02:15:55.530
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

2981
02:15:56.280 --> 02:16:00.390
<v Speaker 2>I think Rhonda obviously had a bad fight</v>
<v Speaker 2>with Holly Holm.</v>

2982
02:16:00.570 --> 02:16:04.500
<v Speaker 2>Holly Holm obviously had a great fight</v>
<v Speaker 2>with Ronda and I think Holly Holm has a</v>

2983
02:16:04.501 --> 02:16:07.980
<v Speaker 2>great style for Rhonda if Rhonda fights</v>
<v Speaker 2>that way.</v>

2984
02:16:08.550 --> 02:16:11.580
<v Speaker 2>But if Rhonda doesn't fight that way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if she fights the way that meesha</v>

2985
02:16:11.581 --> 02:16:13.920
<v Speaker 2>fought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she stays on the outside and she fights</v>

2986
02:16:13.921 --> 02:16:18.120
<v Speaker 2>a little more strategic and she uses</v>
<v Speaker 2>more movement and she incorporates a</v>

2987
02:16:18.121 --> 02:16:20.850
<v Speaker 2>bunch of different types of takedowns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ron does a champion,</v>

2988
02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:26.000
<v Speaker 2>she's an elite athlete and she's one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best expressions of judo we've ever</v>

2989
02:16:26.011 --> 02:16:30.520
<v Speaker 2>seen in all of MMA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Her judo is spectacular if she focuses</v>

2990
02:16:30.521 --> 02:16:32.770
<v Speaker 2>on that aspect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the grappling aspect,</v>

2991
02:16:32.771 --> 02:16:37.771
<v Speaker 2>that judo aspect take downs more than</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to outstand up Holly Holm,</v>

2992
02:16:38.501 --> 02:16:40.060
<v Speaker 2>which I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looked like she did in the first</v>

2993
02:16:40.061 --> 02:16:41.920
<v Speaker 2>place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in her defense she said she got</v>

2994
02:16:41.921 --> 02:16:44.440
<v Speaker 2>rocked by a big punch early in the first</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>

2995
02:16:44.620 --> 02:16:47.590
<v Speaker 2>So it's very difficult to say how much</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that had an effect on her cause she</v>

2996
02:16:47.591 --> 02:16:52.090
<v Speaker 2>did get car wracked by holly like early</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the fight so she could have been out</v>

2997
02:16:52.091 --> 02:16:54.730
<v Speaker 2>of it and not able to stick to our game</v>
<v Speaker 2>plan,</v>

2998
02:16:54.731 --> 02:16:57.400
<v Speaker 2>whatever it might've been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's entirely possible when you get</v>

2999
02:16:57.401 --> 02:17:00.130
<v Speaker 2>cracked like that everything goes out</v>
<v Speaker 2>the window.</v>

3000
02:17:00.131 --> 02:17:03.040
<v Speaker 2>You never know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's normally only person knows is</v>

3001
02:17:03.041 --> 02:17:04.810
<v Speaker 2>the person who got hit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3002
02:17:04.870 --> 02:17:08.110
<v Speaker 2>cause if we see it like Aldo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when Aldo fight mcgregor you just got</v>

3003
02:17:08.111 --> 02:17:10.900
<v Speaker 2>knocked out because is obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We saw in front of us his body stopped</v>

3004
02:17:10.901 --> 02:17:14.740
<v Speaker 2>working but Rhonda could got real close</v>
<v Speaker 2>to that and we didn't even see it.</v>

3005
02:17:15.160 --> 02:17:19.300
<v Speaker 2>She could a blang she dropped one in on</v>
<v Speaker 2>her and Rhonda could have been just out</v>

3006
02:17:19.301 --> 02:17:21.850
<v Speaker 2>of it like drunk not knowing what she's</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

3007
02:17:21.851 --> 02:17:26.320
<v Speaker 2>Like literally looking at life through</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a hole in a shoe box that his</v>

3008
02:17:26.321 --> 02:17:27.840
<v Speaker 2>entire po entirely possible.</v>

3009
02:17:27.930 --> 02:17:32.110
<v Speaker 2>So if they fight again and Rhonda</v>
<v Speaker 2>managers to not get hit like that,</v>

3010
02:17:32.111 --> 02:17:37.111
<v Speaker 2>she fights a little bit more strategic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could see Rhonda absolutely making a</v>

3011
02:17:37.601 --> 02:17:39.790
<v Speaker 2>go at the title again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

3012
02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:41.320
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Being a champion.</v>

3013
02:17:41.321 --> 02:17:42.580
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's one of the best in the world,</v>

3014
02:17:42.610 --> 02:17:46.240
<v Speaker 2>no doubt about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a matter of what does she want?</v>

3015
02:17:46.330 --> 02:17:50.410
<v Speaker 2>What does she want to do with her time?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What d one dedicate herself the way she</v>

3016
02:17:50.411 --> 02:17:52.390
<v Speaker 2>dedicated herself when she was tearing</v>
<v Speaker 2>up the division.</v>

3017
02:17:52.750 --> 02:17:55.420
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a very difficult thing to maintain</v>

3018
02:17:55.780 --> 02:17:58.840
<v Speaker 2>and especially difficult when you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>the massive amount of distractions that</v>

3019
02:17:58.841 --> 02:18:02.410
<v Speaker 2>she has so much Hollywood in her life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so much Hollywood and money,</v>

3020
02:18:02.560 --> 02:18:03.850
<v Speaker 2>so much money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so much.</v>

3021
02:18:04.060 --> 02:18:05.740
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to take care of your life and</v>

3022
02:18:05.741 --> 02:18:08.350
<v Speaker 2>you've got that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think she's the sets the thing too.</v>

3023
02:18:08.351 --> 02:18:10.120
<v Speaker 2>I also think she's taken care of man.</v>

3024
02:18:10.570 --> 02:18:12.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean Ron has got to be worth millions</v>
<v Speaker 2>of dollars.</v>

3025
02:18:12.881 --> 02:18:15.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if she just lives fairly frugally</v>

3026
02:18:15.641 --> 02:18:17.410
<v Speaker 2>and she does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's good.</v>

3027
02:18:17.440 --> 02:18:19.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's not buying gold underwear or</v>

3028
02:18:19.481 --> 02:18:20.680
<v Speaker 2>anything like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I'm saying?</v>

3029
02:18:20.740 --> 02:18:22.720
<v Speaker 2>If she's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's pretty set.</v>

3030
02:18:22.721 --> 02:18:25.090
<v Speaker 2>If she wants to just be set and be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>normal person.</v>

3031
02:18:25.600 --> 02:18:28.180
<v Speaker 2>But I got to imagine that fire probably</v>
<v Speaker 2>still burns.</v>

3032
02:18:28.210 --> 02:18:29.830
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't imagine it doesn't,</v>

3033
02:18:29.920 --> 02:18:32.380
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would think that the intelligent way</v>

3034
02:18:32.381 --> 02:18:34.600
<v Speaker 2>to do it though would be to have a warm</v>
<v Speaker 2>up fight.</v>

3035
02:18:34.780 --> 02:18:36.430
<v Speaker 2>That's what I would think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3036
02:18:36.431 --> 02:18:38.920
<v Speaker 2>and people would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh she should just go right into the</v>

3037
02:18:38.921 --> 02:18:41.240
<v Speaker 2>title fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause what if she loses it?</v>

3038
02:18:41.290 --> 02:18:43.990
<v Speaker 2>Boxing is a reason why boxing has warm</v>
<v Speaker 2>up fights.</v>

3039
02:18:44.050 --> 02:18:46.300
<v Speaker 2>They're smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they were there already figured it</v>

3040
02:18:46.301 --> 02:18:47.021
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're up.</v>

3041
02:18:47.021 --> 02:18:48.700
<v Speaker 2>Fights are good for two things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

3042
02:18:48.701 --> 02:18:49.540
<v Speaker 2>the name warm up.</v>

3043
02:18:49.540 --> 02:18:52.180
<v Speaker 2>It really does warm me up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gets you back to competition.</v>

3044
02:18:52.330 --> 02:18:54.850
<v Speaker 2>And we saw with John Jones when Jon</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jones recently fought,</v>

3045
02:18:54.940 --> 02:18:56.800
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he fought Osp,</v>

3046
02:18:56.801 --> 02:19:00.370
<v Speaker 2>we supposed to fight Daniel cormier and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he felt himself and he said it and he</v>

3047
02:19:00.371 --> 02:19:02.200
<v Speaker 2>just couldn't pull the trigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was kind of fun,</v>

3048
02:19:02.201 --> 02:19:04.270
<v Speaker 2>kind of rusty in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's because he had been out for a long</v>

3049
02:19:04.271 --> 02:19:07.960
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more than a year with a guy that's</v>

3050
02:19:08.050 --> 02:19:10.650
<v Speaker 2>trying to get back at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3051
02:19:10.750 --> 02:19:13.570
<v Speaker 2>I think it was critical for him to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>a tough fight against a guy like</v>

3052
02:19:13.670 --> 02:19:16.810
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's a world class number six ranked</v>

3053
02:19:16.960 --> 02:19:18.740
<v Speaker 2>light heavyweight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get done under the belt as a warmup</v>

3054
02:19:18.760 --> 02:19:21.190
<v Speaker 2>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then fight Daniel cormier and then we're</v>

3055
02:19:21.191 --> 02:19:23.140
<v Speaker 2>going to see what's up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think for Rhonda,</v>

3056
02:19:23.141 --> 02:19:24.850
<v Speaker 2>it's probably a good idea for her to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

3057
02:19:24.851 --> 02:19:29.851
<v Speaker 2>To fight like a top 10 contender,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a tough girl like a Jessica I or someone</v>

3058
02:19:29.961 --> 02:19:30.500
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

3059
02:19:30.500 --> 02:19:33.680
<v Speaker 2>Give that girl a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Give Jessica or Raquel Pennington,</v>

3060
02:19:33.800 --> 02:19:35.870
<v Speaker 2>give her a chance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give her a chance to prove what she can</v>

3061
02:19:35.871 --> 02:19:40.310
<v Speaker 2>do and maybe even upset Rhonda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give Rhonda a chance to get her feet</v>

3062
02:19:40.311 --> 02:19:41.510
<v Speaker 2>wet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get back to competition,</v>

3063
02:19:41.511 --> 02:19:44.420
<v Speaker 2>but not be fighting for the title.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So who knows?</v>

3064
02:19:44.570 --> 02:19:46.040
<v Speaker 2>Who knows what she's going to decide to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>

3065
02:19:46.070 --> 02:19:47.120
<v Speaker 2>but she's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

3066
02:19:47.270 --> 02:19:49.100
<v Speaker 2>she's said no matter what she wants to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>

3067
02:19:49.101 --> 02:19:50.660
<v Speaker 2>it's a matter of what she wants to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>with their legacy.</v>

3068
02:19:50.661 --> 02:19:52.610
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a matter of like a financial</v>

3069
02:19:52.611 --> 02:19:55.910
<v Speaker 2>decision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think at this point in kind of</v>

3070
02:19:55.911 --> 02:19:57.380
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3071
02:19:57.460 --> 02:19:59.570
<v Speaker 2>like I'm thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm con if I'm caught,</v>

3072
02:19:59.571 --> 02:20:02.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to work on my ground game hundred</v>

3073
02:20:02.690 --> 02:20:04.190
<v Speaker 2>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is he doing it?</v>

3074
02:20:04.250 --> 02:20:05.031
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3075
02:20:05.031 --> 02:20:07.910
<v Speaker 2>There's pictures of him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has a brown belt apparently down he's</v>

3076
02:20:07.911 --> 02:20:09.160
<v Speaker 2>training the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3077
02:20:09.161 --> 02:20:10.790
<v Speaker 2>the real issue is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3078
02:20:11.360 --> 02:20:14.660
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a long road to develop those kinds</v>

3079
02:20:14.661 --> 02:20:16.010
<v Speaker 2>of skills at a high level.</v>

3080
02:20:16.310 --> 02:20:19.520
<v Speaker 2>You have to be in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might look good with a few moves,</v>

3081
02:20:19.580 --> 02:20:21.130
<v Speaker 2>like every blue belt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like some,</v>

3082
02:20:21.170 --> 02:20:23.360
<v Speaker 2>some blue belts have like one nasty</v>
<v Speaker 2>armbar.</v>

3083
02:20:23.600 --> 02:20:26.930
<v Speaker 2>Like there's like these dudes that do</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a certain technique and they,</v>

3084
02:20:27.020 --> 02:20:28.930
<v Speaker 2>they hone that shit down to razor</v>
<v Speaker 2>sharpness.</v>

3085
02:20:28.940 --> 02:20:33.380
<v Speaker 2>But if you can avoid that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much else does he have?</v>

3086
02:20:33.620 --> 02:20:35.870
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like having an argument with</v>

3087
02:20:35.871 --> 02:20:37.820
<v Speaker 2>someone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If someone doesn't have a good</v>

3088
02:20:37.821 --> 02:20:40.040
<v Speaker 2>vocabulary and you have an argument with</v>
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>

3089
02:20:40.160 --> 02:20:41.390
<v Speaker 2>they might say one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3090
02:20:41.391 --> 02:20:44.990
<v Speaker 2>well you're fucking stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it might work on some people,</v>

3091
02:20:45.050 --> 02:20:46.070
<v Speaker 2>but you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm stupid.</v>

3092
02:20:46.071 --> 02:20:48.050
<v Speaker 2>What about you dummy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he started talking to that</v>

3093
02:20:48.051 --> 02:20:49.580
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You start talking with a lot of</v>

3094
02:20:49.581 --> 02:20:51.860
<v Speaker 2>different words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having a lot of good points,</v>

3095
02:20:51.980 --> 02:20:54.950
<v Speaker 2>saying a lot of things that you know</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they can argue against and then he</v>

3096
02:20:54.951 --> 02:20:55.940
<v Speaker 2>starts stunning them.</v>

3097
02:20:55.980 --> 02:20:57.740
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what a good argument is with two</v>

3098
02:20:57.741 --> 02:20:58.730
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3099
02:20:58.731 --> 02:21:01.670
<v Speaker 2>if an MMA fighter only has like one or</v>
<v Speaker 2>two moves,</v>

3100
02:21:01.820 --> 02:21:04.790
<v Speaker 2>we only have a few things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to win an argument with</v>

3101
02:21:04.970 --> 02:21:08.480
<v Speaker 2>someone is verbally skilled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu is like that in a lot of ways.</v>

3102
02:21:08.570 --> 02:21:12.950
<v Speaker 2>Like someone can have a fairly good</v>
<v Speaker 2>vocabulary and a fairly good</v>

3103
02:21:12.951 --> 02:21:17.330
<v Speaker 2>understanding of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you were in some sort of a debate</v>

3104
02:21:17.600 --> 02:21:21.710
<v Speaker 2>with like Richard Dawkins about science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you're going to get fucked up.</v>

3105
02:21:22.270 --> 02:21:24.050
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you debate Christopher hitchens while</v>

3106
02:21:24.051 --> 02:21:27.590
<v Speaker 2>he's alive or Sam Harris about religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get fucked up.</v>

3107
02:21:27.680 --> 02:21:29.330
<v Speaker 2>They have more tools,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more weapons,</v>

3108
02:21:29.331 --> 02:21:32.060
<v Speaker 2>more understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the same way with Jujitsu.</v>

3109
02:21:32.370 --> 02:21:33.830
<v Speaker 2>It's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like he said,</v>

3110
02:21:33.831 --> 02:21:34.551
<v Speaker 2>Richard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's his name?</v>

3111
02:21:34.551 --> 02:21:35.610
<v Speaker 2>Richard what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Richard Dawkins.</v>

3112
02:21:36.410 --> 02:21:38.240
<v Speaker 2>He's on a debate team.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He turns a team.</v>

3113
02:21:38.330 --> 02:21:39.163
<v Speaker 2>You're about to fuck</v>

3114
02:21:39.360 --> 02:21:43.780
<v Speaker 1>the scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have no idea about the realm of</v>

3115
02:21:43.781 --> 02:21:46.470
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about to rain on their motherfucker</v>

3116
02:21:46.480 --> 02:21:49.810
<v Speaker 1>tones</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they just pound them out.</v>

3117
02:21:50.070 --> 02:21:52.360
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd be like clergy,</v>

3118
02:21:52.370 --> 02:21:55.750
<v Speaker 1>clergy been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're always debating clergymen,</v>

3119
02:21:56.140 --> 02:21:58.290
<v Speaker 1>rabbis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all these crazy people that</v>

3120
02:21:58.430 --> 02:22:00.100
<v Speaker 1>ancillary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll leave ancient shit.</v>

3121
02:22:00.820 --> 02:22:02.350
<v Speaker 1>Listen man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gotta get the Fuck Outta here.</v>

3122
02:22:02.410 --> 02:22:04.060
<v Speaker 1>Ian Edwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3123
02:22:04.370 --> 02:22:06.580

<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

<v Speaker 1>soccer.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Let me know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very exciting.</v>

3127
02:22:12.520 --> 02:22:13.630
<v Speaker 1>It's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's funny.</v>

3128
02:22:13.631 --> 02:22:16.990
<v Speaker 1>Do I know what you're gonna do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What am I going to come and then you're</v>

3129
02:22:16.991 --> 02:22:20.930
<v Speaker 1>going to talk shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3130
02:22:20.950 --> 02:22:22.240
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you what you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you people,</v>

3131
02:22:22.241 --> 02:22:24.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go stop falling down when people</v>

3132
02:22:24.311 --> 02:22:25.230
<v Speaker 1>slap you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

3133
02:22:25.260 --> 02:22:26.190
<v Speaker 1>Nobody likes that.</v>

3134
02:22:26.250 --> 02:22:27.330
<v Speaker 4>Nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody likes.</v>

3135
02:22:27.331 --> 02:22:29.100
<v Speaker 4>They shouldn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You shouldn't do it.</v>

3136
02:22:29.150 --> 02:22:31.950
<v Speaker 4>It's an MBA now too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's in the NBA now.</v>

3137
02:22:31.951 --> 02:22:34.290
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to hear this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's just shitty.</v>

3138
02:22:34.291 --> 02:22:35.790
<v Speaker 4>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never liked it,</v>

3139
02:22:36.060 --> 02:22:40.010
<v Speaker 4>but people do it to get the free kick or</v>
<v Speaker 4>the penalty or to get the other person's</v>

3140
02:22:40.011 --> 02:22:41.820
<v Speaker 4>sent off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's become a part of the game.</v>

3141
02:22:41.821 --> 02:22:44.210
<v Speaker 4>It's unfortunate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So let's just get that out the way</v>

3142
02:22:44.300 --> 02:22:46.260
<v Speaker 4>before you're coming because that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to see that.</v>

3143
02:22:46.261 --> 02:22:48.330
<v Speaker 4>But besides that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

3144
02:22:48.331 --> 02:22:49.890
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a man's game.</v>

3145
02:22:50.020 --> 02:22:50.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3146
02:22:50.570 --> 02:22:53.740
<v Speaker 2>get the fuck out here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When Raquel Pennington choked down,</v>

3147
02:22:53.741 --> 02:22:55.870
<v Speaker 2>Ashley,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Evan Smith and blood was pouring down</v>

3148
02:22:55.871 --> 02:22:59.050
<v Speaker 2>her face and she strangled or</v>
<v Speaker 2>unconscious with one second to go with a</v>

3149
02:22:59.051 --> 02:23:01.480
<v Speaker 2>bulldog choke in the first round.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a girl,</v>

3150
02:23:01.890 --> 02:23:05.710
<v Speaker 2>135 pound girl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you get smacked of running down the</v>

3151
02:23:05.711 --> 02:23:06.370
<v Speaker 2>field.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3152
02:23:06.370 --> 02:23:07.780
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is bullshit.</v>

3153
02:23:08.190 --> 02:23:10.190
<v Speaker 2>They hold their mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They roll around like a</v>

3154
02:23:10.250 --> 02:23:11.083
<v Speaker 4>baby.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>And when you watch women's soccer,</v>

3156
02:23:12.890 --> 02:23:13.910
<v Speaker 4>women don't do that.</v>

3157
02:23:14.510 --> 02:23:18.440
<v Speaker 2>Women don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Women do not take dies and get smashed.</v>

3158
02:23:18.441 --> 02:23:21.680
<v Speaker 2>Someone needs to start a campaign.</v>
