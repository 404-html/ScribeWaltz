5
00:00:06.901 --> 00:00:07.734
Why?

6
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:08.820

7
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.490

account.

10
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.240
I hate the name Brian Cause I have to.

11
00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:20.380
I say it's Broy.

12
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:21.190
Oh,

13
00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:22.023
it wasn't knowing.

14
00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.983
You know,

15
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:24.450
it's a unique great.

16
00:00:24.451 --> 00:00:25.530
So I spent my whole life going next.

17
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.500
Actually it with a y.

18
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.010
It's a boring name to begin with.

19
00:00:29.011 --> 00:00:31.020
It's not like it's a unique name dude.

20
00:00:31.021 --> 00:00:31.854
I'm Joe.

21
00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:33.200
That is the most that is.

22
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:33.571
Yeah,

23
00:00:33.571 --> 00:00:35.610
but you can't really mess with that name.

24
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:36.450
Jail.

25
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.380
It's just so simple.

26
00:00:37.381 --> 00:00:39.750
I've seen people write ready j o on line at Starbucks.

27
00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:42.090
They're trying to fuck with me.

28
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.080
They're trying to make me a woman.

29
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.170
I know you have a lot of feminine energy.

30
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.591
Honestly,

31
00:00:46.591 --> 00:00:47.424
I didn't want to go.

32
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:48.380
I'm Jay.

33
00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.110
Oh yeah,

34
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.950
we the features.

35
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.110
You're your delicate features in your face that long actual,

36
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.980
I knows I've delicate bones.

37
00:00:55.981 --> 00:00:56.350
Joe.

38
00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.610
Joe.

39
00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:57.450
Is that a girl or a boy?

40
00:00:57.451 --> 00:00:58.950
That Guy Rolling J.

41
00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:59.191
Oh,

42
00:00:59.191 --> 00:01:00.090
Rogan's girl.

43
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.930
Mm.

44
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.460
This is how unoriginal my family is.

45
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.590
My grandmother's name was Josephine.

46
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:06.490
My grandfather's name was Joseph.

47
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.581
How?

48
00:01:06.581 --> 00:01:09.660
My Dad's name was Joseph and my name is Joseph.

49
00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.220
Terrible fucking apes.

50
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.110
Don't fucking cage my ne.

51
00:01:19.111 --> 00:01:23.660
My grandma's name is rose [inaudible] name is Dominic stills a normal limb.

52
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.503
Korea.

53
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:25.493
Michael.

54
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.333
Yeah.

55
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:27.900
My mother had a cool name,

56
00:01:27.901 --> 00:01:28.770
but she didn't like it.

57
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.440
My mother was born and it was a Santa I Santa Santa's Dan.

58
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:34.140
She didn't like it.

59
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.973
She hated it.

60
00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:36.570
She changed it to Susan.

61
00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:38.131
That's crazy.

62
00:01:38.131 --> 00:01:38.371
Yeah,

63
00:01:38.371 --> 00:01:38.731
she would,

64
00:01:38.731 --> 00:01:39.690
she wouldn't let anybody,

65
00:01:39.691 --> 00:01:42.240
I didn't even know her name was a Sante until I was like in high school.

66
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.931
My friends,

67
00:01:42.931 --> 00:01:47.220
his mother was a hippie and she named him Blue Quan one Tega.

68
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.531
Oh,

69
00:01:47.531 --> 00:01:47.820
no.

70
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:48.690
Lawless.

71
00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.780
No.

72
00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.780
It's like I didn't like Gwyneth Paltrow namer kid apple buy without even knowing

73
00:01:55.861 --> 00:01:56.190
that.

74
00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.530
I will say say to you 100% she did,

75
00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:59.693
but it's like,

76
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:00.631
you know there's,

77
00:02:00.631 --> 00:02:01.530
we have an issue with that,

78
00:02:01.531 --> 00:02:01.801
but what,

79
00:02:01.801 --> 00:02:01.980
you know,

80
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.990
why is apple any worse than Joe?

81
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.371
It's not.

82
00:02:05.371 --> 00:02:06.204
It's just not.

83
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.073
I think that people have,

84
00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.770
I have,

85
00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.690
and I don't even know how to explain it and I,

86
00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.220
and I'm going to get into a larger point about it.

87
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.000
I had this strange reaction and it's not a positive one.

88
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.830
Whenever a celebrity in Hollywood names their kids something really cool,

89
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.401
right?

90
00:02:20.401 --> 00:02:23.040
Like it might be adorable if it was your neighbor,

91
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:24.300
yeah.

92
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.760
Of Your name or had a kid named apple and they were really nice.

93
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:27.930
I think what makes me more,

94
00:02:27.931 --> 00:02:31.410
what annoys me more is that they're making the name of the kid about themselves,

95
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:32.820
not about the kid.

96
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:33.211
Oh,

97
00:02:33.211 --> 00:02:34.260
I see what you're saying.

98
00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.430
That's what bothers me about it.

99
00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.731
Yeah.

100
00:02:35.731 --> 00:02:37.830
I think you're probably onto something good.

101
00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:38.880
You're onto you.

102
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.560
You sense the pretension?

103
00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:41.400
Yeah.

104
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.840
Like when when puffy combs,

105
00:02:42.841 --> 00:02:43.674
I think it was word,

106
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:44.970
it's pretension,

107
00:02:44.971 --> 00:02:47.070
but it's also a little bit of spectacle.

108
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.030
It's a little bit and like,

109
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.893
Hey,

110
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.730
I named my kid Brooklyn,

111
00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.550
apple and a rumor,

112
00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.430
which are all cool names and I'm not saying,

113
00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.080
and maybe I would do the same,

114
00:02:58.081 --> 00:02:59.930
but I do feel like the,

115
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:00.371
again,

116
00:03:00.371 --> 00:03:02.710
of course you're making a little bit about yourself.

117
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:03.880
You've got to name your kid,

118
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.100
maybe you feel the pressure to name your kid.

119
00:03:06.101 --> 00:03:07.000
Something very different.

120
00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:08.483
I Dunno.

121
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:09.431
Yeah,

122
00:03:09.431 --> 00:03:10.660
I think I'm being a little,

123
00:03:10.661 --> 00:03:10.871
no,

124
00:03:10.871 --> 00:03:11.240
you're wrong.

125
00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.570
You're onto something though.

126
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.610
We don't like like fake energy people.

127
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.680
Nobody likes like I'm a healer.

128
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:18.480
You know what I mean?

129
00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.170
You know what I mean?

130
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.730
Is like that fakeness that comes with.

131
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.350
But we do like,

132
00:03:23.351 --> 00:03:26.200
like we were talking about yoga before this show started.

133
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.520
Like we like people that are really in the yoga because they actually enjoy the

134
00:03:30.521 --> 00:03:31.241
benefits of it.

135
00:03:31.241 --> 00:03:33.820
And then really they're really kind of down to earth and centered.

136
00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.290
Those are nice people to be around.

137
00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.830
Yes.

138
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.000
But the ones who were faking that thing are fucking gross.

139
00:03:40.001 --> 00:03:41.650
So they're wearing it like a costume.

140
00:03:41.651 --> 00:03:41.921
Right?

141
00:03:41.921 --> 00:03:44.500
So it becomes a character that they've taken over.

142
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:45.603
And again,

143
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.800
that's something called affectation.

144
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.320
They're not doing it for the utility of Yoga,

145
00:03:50.321 --> 00:03:51.880
like where you're working something out,

146
00:03:51.881 --> 00:03:54.670
whether it's peace of mind or getting more centered or whatever,

147
00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.331
uh,

148
00:03:55.331 --> 00:03:56.260
and getting healthier.

149
00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.750
I think that some people actually wear that cloak and become somewhat tyrannical

150
00:04:01.751 --> 00:04:02.584
about it.

151
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.110
They put on the outfit,

152
00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.190
the costume.

153
00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:07.540
Now there are Yogi.

154
00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.050
Now they're going to speak about being on the spiritual path and within that is

155
00:04:11.051 --> 00:04:13.180
always a little bit of a look at this,

156
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.380
these common cattle,

157
00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.880
these people who drink coffee and other stimulants and obviously eat meat.

158
00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:19.390
You know,

159
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.070
that's kind of what I think we react to.

160
00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.461
Oh,

161
00:04:21.461 --> 00:04:24.970
I was listening to this conversation and yoga class with this woman who was

162
00:04:24.971 --> 00:04:27.880
advising this man on what he should do with his diet,

163
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.040
and she was saying that meat is toxic.

164
00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:32.530
It's toxic,

165
00:04:32.531 --> 00:04:33.780
it's toxic going.

166
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:34.080
I mean,

167
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.871
the way she was doing,

168
00:04:34.871 --> 00:04:35.111
I was like,

169
00:04:35.111 --> 00:04:35.640
what do you see?

170
00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.330
It's fucking protein and water.

171
00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.970
Like it's one of the most easily digestible things that people eat that good.

172
00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.550
What I love to do with people like that,

173
00:04:42.551 --> 00:04:43.570
whenever they mentioned toxins,

174
00:04:43.571 --> 00:04:44.830
like you sweat out all these toxins.

175
00:04:44.831 --> 00:04:45.030
I go,

176
00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.250
dude,

177
00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.480
what title would explore?

178
00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.760
What are the toxins going through your sweat?

179
00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:49.001
Yeah.

180
00:04:49.001 --> 00:04:49.600
What are they,

181
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.821
you know,

182
00:04:49.821 --> 00:04:50.980
were toxins gets filtered.

183
00:04:50.981 --> 00:04:51.890
Your fucking little liver.

184
00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:52.401
Okay.

185
00:04:52.401 --> 00:04:52.540
Yeah,

186
00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:53.800
and your kids are in your blood.

187
00:04:53.801 --> 00:04:54.970
Your liver filters it out.

188
00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.580
You're not getting toxins out of your body,

189
00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:58.180
right?

190
00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.630
Oh,

191
00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.690
somebody told me they did some foot thing where they put you in a foot bath and

192
00:05:02.691 --> 00:05:03.670
then it turns brown.

193
00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:04.121
Yeah,

194
00:05:04.121 --> 00:05:05.670
because the toxins in your body,

195
00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:07.090
while they've done experiments on that,

196
00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:08.160
which is it,

197
00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.860
it reacts with the metal in the water to create with the sodium,

198
00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:14.920
a certain sodium compound and it creates rust.

199
00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:16.163
It's rust.

200
00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.421
Oh,

201
00:05:16.421 --> 00:05:18.040
so what is it they're putting on your feet?

202
00:05:18.041 --> 00:05:20.170
They put like put your feet in there.

203
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.381
Yeah,

204
00:05:20.381 --> 00:05:21.640
they put your feet in there and then they have a,

205
00:05:21.641 --> 00:05:24.370
an electric charge or put potassium in it like a,

206
00:05:24.371 --> 00:05:25.750
a nail with an electric charge.

207
00:05:25.751 --> 00:05:26.381
Toxins,

208
00:05:26.381 --> 00:05:27.100
man.

209
00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.130
And that Brown stuff is coming out of your feet and make a lot of money.

210
00:05:30.131 --> 00:05:32.140
That's why he tried to tell me that like take,

211
00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.630
they're taking the toxins out of your body and after you do it,

212
00:05:34.631 --> 00:05:35.890
you just feel amazing.

213
00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:36.880
It's like,

214
00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:37.780
Oh God,

215
00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.260
this is one of the beautiful things about the Internet is those people like you

216
00:05:41.261 --> 00:05:41.561
can go,

217
00:05:41.561 --> 00:05:41.921
okay,

218
00:05:41.921 --> 00:05:42.754
is that real?

219
00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:44.020
And then you Google it and you'd go,

220
00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.471
no,

221
00:05:44.471 --> 00:05:45.460
here's all these studies.

222
00:05:45.461 --> 00:05:46.600
And they show that you're retarded.

223
00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.310
There's a book I read about that where they,

224
00:05:48.311 --> 00:05:51.590
they break that particular thing down that that,

225
00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.550
that for putting your feet in the water turns brown and all the toxins come out.

226
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:55.361
God,

227
00:05:55.361 --> 00:05:56.141
it's so dumb,

228
00:05:56.141 --> 00:06:01.141
but it's like here it is before iron after 30 minute treatment.

229
00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:02.660
Amazing.

230
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:03.350
Except for you.

231
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:04.101
They're the same thing.

232
00:06:04.101 --> 00:06:06.080
And take your feet out and put another compound in there.

233
00:06:06.081 --> 00:06:06.920
It turns Brown as well.

234
00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:09.440
Look at that fucking bullshit.

235
00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:10.470
Look at that like they're,

236
00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:13.340
they're really trying to pretend that all that Brown is coming out of your body.

237
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.320
If you have all that stuff in your body,

238
00:06:15.321 --> 00:06:16.580
you fucking dying.

239
00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:17.211
All right.

240
00:06:17.211 --> 00:06:18.470
That's really bad.

241
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:19.100
Yeah,

242
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.770
it's very weird of sucks it out of your body.

243
00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:23.300
So gross.

244
00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:28.360
There's so much that gross fake shit out there that gross fake like healing and

245
00:06:29.661 --> 00:06:31.740
psychic healers in zone healers,

246
00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:32.653
even that,

247
00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:33.770
even that is always,

248
00:06:33.771 --> 00:06:35.210
if you actually scratch into it.

249
00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:36.290
And I spent a nut,

250
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:36.741
you know me,

251
00:06:36.741 --> 00:06:39.350
I got a lot of patients from those people that do love him.

252
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:40.280
And,

253
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:41.960
and how about the one who came up to you the other day?

254
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.820
The one that we both know that,

255
00:06:43.821 --> 00:06:44.030
uh,

256
00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:45.050
said do something.

257
00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.760
It's about allowing,

258
00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:47.780
oh,

259
00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:48.920
please tell me more.

260
00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:51.350
Please tell me more about this text message.

261
00:06:51.351 --> 00:06:51.951
We don't have to name him.

262
00:06:51.951 --> 00:06:52.211
He said,

263
00:06:52.211 --> 00:06:53.090
please tell me more.

264
00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.290
It's just an interesting,

265
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:55.170
I,

266
00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:56.300
I'm very hesitant to,

267
00:06:56.301 --> 00:07:00.110
in case he listens to the or that person listens to your podcasts and everything

268
00:07:00.111 --> 00:07:00.470
else to us.

269
00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:02.000
But yeah,

270
00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:05.990
some people tend to decide that they,

271
00:07:05.991 --> 00:07:07.940
I think it's very common,

272
00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:08.961
especially in La,

273
00:07:08.961 --> 00:07:12.770
in places for people to believe that they have found the answer.

274
00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.740
I know all this conventional wisdom is,

275
00:07:15.741 --> 00:07:16.574
um,

276
00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:17.870
is is your thing.

277
00:07:17.871 --> 00:07:21.470
But I actually have a roundabout way and then they'll play with words and I'll

278
00:07:21.471 --> 00:07:22.490
say it's not about doing,

279
00:07:22.491 --> 00:07:23.770
it's kind of about allowing,

280
00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:25.380
like I,

281
00:07:25.381 --> 00:07:25.701
and I,

282
00:07:25.701 --> 00:07:26.031
you know,

283
00:07:26.031 --> 00:07:26.601
I love that.

284
00:07:26.601 --> 00:07:27.231
I'm just like,

285
00:07:27.231 --> 00:07:28.550
I'll give you roll probably like,

286
00:07:28.551 --> 00:07:29.180
dude,

287
00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:30.050
that's amazing.

288
00:07:30.051 --> 00:07:34.940
Tell me more immediately so I can talk about it on Joe Rogan's podcast with 16

289
00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:35.773
million.

290
00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:38.510
Oh Christ.

291
00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:39.830
You deal with that all the time,

292
00:07:39.831 --> 00:07:40.130
man.

293
00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:40.331
You,

294
00:07:40.331 --> 00:07:40.710
you,

295
00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:41.920
I think my,

296
00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.050
my biggest thing with the healer kind of crowd,

297
00:07:45.051 --> 00:07:46.820
and some of them are great people of course,

298
00:07:46.821 --> 00:07:48.140
and maybe they do some good of course,

299
00:07:48.141 --> 00:07:53.141
but a lot of them are wearing it at to bludgeon you with it or it's a piece of

300
00:07:53.601 --> 00:07:54.310
identity.

301
00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:54.570
It's,

302
00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:54.810
it's,

303
00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:55.790
everything else has kind of gone.

304
00:07:55.791 --> 00:07:59.450
I got unwell and they turn their own crisis into sort of a,

305
00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:01.000
you know,

306
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:01.500
they've,

307
00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:02.000
they've,

308
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.050
they've found their calling,

309
00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:04.220
which is a healer.

310
00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:04.800
You also,

311
00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.830
I don't buy a,

312
00:08:06.831 --> 00:08:11.831
don't buy the ideas of people that are like trying to be leaders are trying to

313
00:08:12.051 --> 00:08:16.040
push things and trying to like create these movements and trying to,

314
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.400
if they don't do something to push themselves.

315
00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:24.610
Like if I see you and you have a sloppy face and a big old double chin and your

316
00:08:24.741 --> 00:08:26.120
gut is hanging off your pants,

317
00:08:26.121 --> 00:08:27.860
your greedily await your food.

318
00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:30.350
As you're sitting around with all these people that are listening to you,

319
00:08:30.351 --> 00:08:30.890
I'm like,

320
00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:34.820
you're a guy that's caught up in the grips of not taking care of your own meat

321
00:08:34.821 --> 00:08:35.350
wagon.

322
00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:35.580
Yeah.

323
00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:36.860
So why am I gonna listen to you?

324
00:08:36.861 --> 00:08:41.861
About how you describe how we're supposed to live life and how the peaceful

325
00:08:42.171 --> 00:08:44.600
energy flows through your shock rose and like,

326
00:08:44.601 --> 00:08:44.901
what do you,

327
00:08:44.901 --> 00:08:45.211
what do you what?

328
00:08:45.211 --> 00:08:46.610
What exactly are you saying?

329
00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.940
You just trying to get people to listen to because that's what it kind of seems

330
00:08:49.941 --> 00:08:50.600
like.

331
00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:50.821
Well,

332
00:08:50.821 --> 00:08:53.120
it kind of seems like you just want to be a leader that's,

333
00:08:53.121 --> 00:08:54.260
that's usually what it is.

334
00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:55.183
They don't,

335
00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:56.210
yeah.

336
00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:57.660
<v 1>They don't push themselves.</v>

337
00:08:57.710 --> 00:08:58.210
Yeah.

338
00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:01.540
I think unless you're involved in some adverse situation,

339
00:09:01.541 --> 00:09:04.710
some situation where you have to encounter adversity and find out what you're

340
00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:05.544
made of,

341
00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:06.511
whatever you're doing,

342
00:09:06.511 --> 00:09:07.261
whenever pursuit,

343
00:09:07.261 --> 00:09:08.100
if you do in one of those,

344
00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:08.640
what else?

345
00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:09.540
Crazy mudders,

346
00:09:09.541 --> 00:09:10.111
those crazy,

347
00:09:10.111 --> 00:09:10.944
racist,

348
00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:11.461
tough mudder.

349
00:09:11.461 --> 00:09:12.294
Tough mudders.

350
00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:13.500
People love that man.

351
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:14.520
You know why they love that?

352
00:09:14.521 --> 00:09:16.170
Because they are getting fucking pushed.

353
00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:18.360
They have to find out what they're made out of.

354
00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.010
You don't find that in a cubicle.

355
00:09:20.011 --> 00:09:21.210
You just fucking don't.

356
00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:21.550
Right.

357
00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:24.990
I think there's a crazy desire that people have to do triathlons.

358
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.190
I'm gonna see if I can do it.

359
00:09:26.191 --> 00:09:28.650
I want to do a sub three hour marathon.

360
00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:33.540
It was like these fucking desires to push yourself because we don't encounter

361
00:09:33.541 --> 00:09:34.770
enough mortality.

362
00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:37.560
We don't encounter enough disease.

363
00:09:37.561 --> 00:09:42.561
We don't encounter enough sadness to make ourselves aware of the special moment

364
00:09:43.231 --> 00:09:45.040
that you have when you've achieved peace.

365
00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:47.430
And I really think we have a genetic memory of all those things.

366
00:09:47.431 --> 00:09:48.150
I do.

367
00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:48.660
I do.

368
00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:48.961
You know,

369
00:09:48.961 --> 00:09:50.370
you're putting in a world where you're don't,

370
00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:51.780
you're not being tested.

371
00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:55.260
I struggle is such a huge part of the human experience and needs and are they

372
00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:56.790
other thing about Gulu is though,

373
00:09:56.791 --> 00:09:59.820
is that when you see somebody who talks a lot and they're telling you the

374
00:09:59.821 --> 00:10:02.580
secrets and methodology and technology of life,

375
00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:06.840
the problem with that is that when you see below really accomplished something

376
00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:08.430
like John Wayne par or whatever,

377
00:10:08.431 --> 00:10:12.320
if you guys tell him we par to tell me the secrets of fighting John Wayne,

378
00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:13.350
Paul would look at me and go,

379
00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:16.710
oh well you'd probably have to go train for 10 years.

380
00:10:16.711 --> 00:10:19.650
And a lot of it is something you'd have to experience and practice.

381
00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:21.750
Not something I can tell you about.

382
00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:24.210
And I think anybody who has these,

383
00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:24.750
uh,

384
00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:26.970
sharp profile who has really,

385
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.570
really cool ways of putting words together,

386
00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:32.040
you shouldn't be a little aware,

387
00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:32.790
be aware,

388
00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:36.660
be a little bit of where it's a good example that you are what I would consider

389
00:10:36.661 --> 00:10:38.220
a master standup comedian.

390
00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:42.300
You've been doing standup comedy for more than a decade professionally.

391
00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:43.830
You're hilarious.

392
00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:44.640
You know,

393
00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:45.411
every time I see you,

394
00:10:45.411 --> 00:10:46.244
you're killing.

395
00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:49.130
If you had to tell someone how to do stand up,

396
00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:50.070
how would,

397
00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:51.570
how the fuck would you even begin?

398
00:10:51.571 --> 00:10:56.410
And imagine having the gall to tell someone how they should do stand.

399
00:10:56.411 --> 00:10:57.090
It's incredible.

400
00:10:57.090 --> 00:11:02.090
But the reality is life is kind of like stand up in a way in that you have to do

401
00:11:02.341 --> 00:11:03.210
it your way.

402
00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:03.721
You know?

403
00:11:03.721 --> 00:11:07.170
And if you like wearing dresses and ball gags and getting beat up,

404
00:11:07.171 --> 00:11:10.080
I checked who fucking mice had is something wrong with that?

405
00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:13.290
As long as you're not hurting anybody and if you are hurting them is because

406
00:11:13.291 --> 00:11:14.310
they want you to hurt them.

407
00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:16.170
You're in some weird situation.

408
00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.780
W who gives a fuck really?

409
00:11:18.781 --> 00:11:19.680
Who gives a fuck?

410
00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:22.500
It's so when some guy comes along,

411
00:11:22.501 --> 00:11:22.831
it's not,

412
00:11:22.831 --> 00:11:24.510
it's about allowing sometimes,

413
00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:27.630
sometimes about being beating your car going fuck you.

414
00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:28.590
Fuck you,

415
00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:28.981
fuck you.

416
00:11:28.981 --> 00:11:30.690
And then you go to work with a big smile on your face.

417
00:11:30.691 --> 00:11:30.930
Yeah.

418
00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:32.570
Cause you were laughing in the,

419
00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:37.580
and jokingly completely in the nature of like joking around all through your day

420
00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:39.960
or were for Shit,

421
00:11:39.961 --> 00:11:41.970
mouth and people fuck mouth the people.

422
00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:43.230
I do that all the time.

423
00:11:43.231 --> 00:11:44.064
It's therapeutic.

424
00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:46.080
I do it all the time just for amusement.

425
00:11:46.081 --> 00:11:47.340
I amuse myself,

426
00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:47.800
right.

427
00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:48.660
I like,

428
00:11:48.661 --> 00:11:50.130
I'll see myself in the car like come on,

429
00:11:50.131 --> 00:11:50.581
fuck face,

430
00:11:50.581 --> 00:11:51.211
come on,

431
00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:54.190
fuck face you could to you fucking dummy.

432
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:55.360
<v 2>You're fucking dummy.</v>

433
00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:58.150
I'm never really mad at that guy.

434
00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:01.150
I'm a mocking it cause it's fun to do it.

435
00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:02.980
It makes an a normal,

436
00:12:02.981 --> 00:12:04.480
ordinary moment entertaining.

437
00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:05.110
Right.

438
00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:06.340
So I think you're right.

439
00:12:06.341 --> 00:12:06.851
I think it is.

440
00:12:06.851 --> 00:12:08.830
I think life is a lot like stand up in that sense.

441
00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:09.340
You know,

442
00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:10.930
we have different styles of living.

443
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:11.520
You know,

444
00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:11.830
it's,

445
00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:15.270
it's one of the cool things about life and I think everybody's person,

446
00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:19.720
like different personalities gravitate towards different styles of living just

447
00:12:19.721 --> 00:12:21.250
automatically and organically.

448
00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:21.331
The,

449
00:12:21.331 --> 00:12:23.410
some way people gravitate towards jobs,

450
00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:24.191
you know,

451
00:12:24.191 --> 00:12:25.870
the way some people are just drawn,

452
00:12:25.871 --> 00:12:27.520
I want to be a comic book illustrator.

453
00:12:27.521 --> 00:12:28.331
I'm drawn to it,

454
00:12:28.331 --> 00:12:28.810
you know,

455
00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:29.860
or some people are fucking,

456
00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:30.641
I've always loved music,

457
00:12:30.641 --> 00:12:30.821
man.

458
00:12:30.821 --> 00:12:32.170
Just always wanted to be a musician.

459
00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:33.310
There's even that,

460
00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:34.000
my son,

461
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.230
I told you I went to,

462
00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:39.670
I watched him at his school play whatever and he's not even four.

463
00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:41.133
And,

464
00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:44.740
and it was so funny because all the kids were singing their songs and doing

465
00:12:44.741 --> 00:12:49.741
their thing and my son is on the sidelines pulling his mouth open as wide as he

466
00:12:50.891 --> 00:12:51.724
possibly can,

467
00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:55.390
can then he'd shops over and just jumps in this kid's face.

468
00:12:55.391 --> 00:12:57.160
Then he decides I'm getting Outta here,

469
00:12:57.161 --> 00:12:59.290
pulls his shirt up and walks off stage.

470
00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:01.120
He gets the teacher's chasing him,

471
00:13:01.121 --> 00:13:02.080
he realizes it,

472
00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:03.400
he's disrupting everything.

473
00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:06.820
And he did a variation of that for all four songs.

474
00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.440
And my wife was like,

475
00:13:08.441 --> 00:13:08.621
you know,

476
00:13:08.621 --> 00:13:10.330
this is crazy and this is bad.

477
00:13:10.331 --> 00:13:10.601
And I,

478
00:13:10.601 --> 00:13:11.160
and I,

479
00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:11.501
I was like,

480
00:13:11.501 --> 00:13:11.920
listen,

481
00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:15.430
all I know is I was exactly the same.

482
00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:17.230
I don't remember it being a good thing.

483
00:13:17.231 --> 00:13:18.730
It's probably going to be a bit of a struggle for him.

484
00:13:18.731 --> 00:13:19.990
Who knows how to navigate it.

485
00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:21.430
But there's one thing for sure,

486
00:13:21.431 --> 00:13:22.510
he's not a conformist.

487
00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:26.470
He's very different and he sees the world very differently and he'd way rather

488
00:13:26.471 --> 00:13:28.150
be doing this thing over here.

489
00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:29.440
And you know,

490
00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:30.161
I kind of looked,

491
00:13:30.161 --> 00:13:30.911
I was like,

492
00:13:30.911 --> 00:13:31.570
I thought to myself,

493
00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:34.180
I've always been the exact same way.

494
00:13:34.181 --> 00:13:35.560
I've always been that way.

495
00:13:35.561 --> 00:13:37.960
I've always wondered if it's a genetics I,

496
00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:40.360
it has to be because he's so similar to me,

497
00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:42.760
to the point where I remember doing that.

498
00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:43.870
I remember going,

499
00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:45.100
this is embarrassing,

500
00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:47.590
I'm not going to sing like everybody else.

501
00:13:47.591 --> 00:13:48.490
I remember looking over,

502
00:13:48.491 --> 00:13:52.060
I was in kindergarten and I saw their mouths wide open and they were singing.

503
00:13:52.061 --> 00:13:52.690
And I was like,

504
00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:53.380
well,

505
00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:54.850
that's embarrassing.

506
00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:56.950
And My mother came over and she said,

507
00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:57.580
what?

508
00:13:57.580 --> 00:13:58.270
What's wrong?

509
00:13:58.270 --> 00:13:59.200
And I said,

510
00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:01.150
I don't think we should be doing this.

511
00:14:01.151 --> 00:14:01.691
And she said,

512
00:14:01.691 --> 00:14:02.170
why?

513
00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:02.800
And I said,

514
00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:05.170
because we're not that good.

515
00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:07.690
I knew at that age,

516
00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:11.980
I was very aware at that age how bad we were at singing and dancing.

517
00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:12.340
You know,

518
00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:12.900
it's fun.

519
00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:14.560
And I think my son felt the same way.

520
00:14:14.561 --> 00:14:19.210
He was a little embarrassed at the bad performance because there's nothing worse

521
00:14:19.211 --> 00:14:19.990
than seeing,

522
00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:20.500
I dunno,

523
00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:21.333
16,

524
00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:23.260
three and a half year olds trying to sing a song.

525
00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:24.011
Yeah.

526
00:14:24.011 --> 00:14:27.130
You got to wait until they're five before you even go to those things.

527
00:14:27.131 --> 00:14:27.964
For Real.

528
00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:29.470
They just hundred percent.

529
00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.820
I just can't do it yet.

530
00:14:30.821 --> 00:14:31.421
Forget it.

531
00:14:31.421 --> 00:14:32.051
It's chaos.

532
00:14:32.051 --> 00:14:32.861
But it's adorable.

533
00:14:32.861 --> 00:14:34.630
People love watching their kids do things,

534
00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:35.201
you know?

535
00:14:35.201 --> 00:14:38.110
It's like their kid gets to be a star for a brief moment in time.

536
00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:39.023
It's true.

537
00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:39.401
Yeah.

538
00:14:39.401 --> 00:14:40.420
That's a weird thing.

539
00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:41.650
It's a weird thing.

540
00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:42.401
What is your,

541
00:14:42.401 --> 00:14:43.450
let me ask you this question.

542
00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:44.471
We haven't talked about it,

543
00:14:44.471 --> 00:14:45.304
but,

544
00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:46.293
and be honest.

545
00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:47.360
What was the,

546
00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:48.850
we are first reaction,

547
00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:52.070
like your first gut reaction if you even had one when you

548
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:52.903
<v 1>saw,</v>

549
00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:53.600
um,

550
00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:56.840
the picture of Bruce Jenner on Vanity Fair under the title.

551
00:14:56.841 --> 00:14:57.674
Call me Caitlyn.

552
00:14:58.070 --> 00:14:58.790
Well,

553
00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:02.270
I got it when I was bear hunting with a bow and arrow.

554
00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:05.810
Let's just pause for a second.

555
00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:06.980
That's when I got it.

556
00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:08.300
Let's have a moment of silence for that.

557
00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:10.040
Jamie sent it to me.

558
00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:13.700
Jamie was the first one to send it to me and then my wife sent it to me and I

559
00:15:13.701 --> 00:15:14.060
was like,

560
00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:14.893
oh fuck.

561
00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:17.270
Actually know my wife was first and Jamie was second.

562
00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:18.020
Sorry Dude.

563
00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:18.390
She got,

564
00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:19.070
yeah,

565
00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:20.060
but it was very close.

566
00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:21.620
It was basically both of them send it to me.

567
00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:23.180
Um,

568
00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:23.841
and uh,

569
00:15:23.841 --> 00:15:27.490
I had bear blood on my clothes and uh,

570
00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:32.090
we were stopping into this town to go on a doc to catch some Walleye in northern

571
00:15:32.091 --> 00:15:34.760
pike and as dark as it gets.

572
00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:35.511
Yeah.

573
00:15:35.511 --> 00:15:36.440
I was doing man shit.

574
00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:37.220
Yeah.

575
00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:37.880
For real man.

576
00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:38.200
Shit.

577
00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:38.510
Yeah.

578
00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:39.110
You know,

579
00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:39.561
I mean,

580
00:15:39.561 --> 00:15:40.340
um,

581
00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:41.900
eat meat or don't eat meat,

582
00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:43.220
but if you are going to eat meat,

583
00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:45.410
you really can't be upset at people hunting.

584
00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:49.250
You really can't because it's exciting and uh,

585
00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:50.020
it takes,

586
00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:53.750
it's a huge discipline and the food is amazing.

587
00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:57.920
The meat that you get from wild game is so much better.

588
00:15:57.950 --> 00:16:02.950
It also the money that p that parks make from hunting and and on wildlife

589
00:16:04.641 --> 00:16:08.990
federation fishing wildlife preserve a great deal of habitat for animals.

590
00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:12.350
It's what it preserves more habitat for animals because of hunting than anything

591
00:16:12.351 --> 00:16:12.710
else.

592
00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:16.580
The conservation aspect of hunting is totally overlooked because people want to

593
00:16:16.581 --> 00:16:19.390
look at hunters like there's some evil person the kid would just with living in

594
00:16:19.391 --> 00:16:20.750
this really fucked up,

595
00:16:20.751 --> 00:16:23.870
contradictory society where every day you're driving on the street,

596
00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:26.930
you're passing by gas stations that are filled with meat,

597
00:16:26.931 --> 00:16:27.770
snacks,

598
00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:33.470
disgusting meat that's ground up into some fucking goofy hamburger and frozen

599
00:16:33.471 --> 00:16:34.490
and you microwave it.

600
00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:34.791
All these,

601
00:16:34.791 --> 00:16:35.624
all that shit.

602
00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:37.940
Those been in beef burritos.

603
00:16:37.941 --> 00:16:38.690
They sell.

604
00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:39.523
What is that?

605
00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:43.250
That's murdered animals that were ground up and they come from three different

606
00:16:43.251 --> 00:16:45.230
countries sometimes that were killed six months ago.

607
00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:45.591
Oh,

608
00:16:45.591 --> 00:16:46.220
easily.

609
00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:46.731
Easily.

610
00:16:46.731 --> 00:16:49.930
Who knows how long that she has been frozen for and the,

611
00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:50.960
nobody seems to,

612
00:16:50.961 --> 00:16:52.580
it's doesn't seem to phase anyone.

613
00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:53.211
You know,

614
00:16:53.211 --> 00:16:54.500
you walk into a supermarket,

615
00:16:54.501 --> 00:16:57.740
you're passing by just rows and rows of meet you.

616
00:16:57.741 --> 00:16:59.240
Every Mcdonald's,

617
00:16:59.241 --> 00:17:01.040
every Jack in the box is meat,

618
00:17:01.041 --> 00:17:01.281
meat,

619
00:17:01.281 --> 00:17:01.491
meat,

620
00:17:01.491 --> 00:17:01.701
meat,

621
00:17:01.701 --> 00:17:02.300
meat.

622
00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:02.690
But we're,

623
00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:05.570
we're completely disconnected from it by living in this.

624
00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:08.000
I think cities are awesome by the way.

625
00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:08.631
And you know,

626
00:17:08.631 --> 00:17:08.781
one,

627
00:17:08.781 --> 00:17:11.810
I really started to appreciate cities when you and I started going on these

628
00:17:11.811 --> 00:17:12.261
trips.

629
00:17:12.261 --> 00:17:12.740
Yeah,

630
00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:14.360
well it's when you and I went to Montana,

631
00:17:14.361 --> 00:17:15.650
or even better recently,

632
00:17:15.651 --> 00:17:18.560
like it's perfect example when we did that Prince of Wales show,

633
00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:20.600
we went on to Prince of Wales Island.

634
00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:25.130
We got rained on every fucking day for five days and when we came back to la,

635
00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:26.900
it was amazing.

636
00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.910
I loved this place so much.

637
00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:33.320
The son felt so good because one of the greatest message I've ever gotten from

638
00:17:33.321 --> 00:17:33.650
me,

639
00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:35.420
I just get this random message a,

640
00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:36.390
hey,

641
00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:37.220
it's Joe.

642
00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:37.910
Um,

643
00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:38.390
hey,

644
00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:39.950
do you feel really great?

645
00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:42.170
I feel fucking amazing.

646
00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:42.861
I don't know if you do,

647
00:17:42.861 --> 00:17:44.660
but I feel fucking amazing man.

648
00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:45.711
How do you feel?

649
00:17:45.711 --> 00:17:46.730
Do you feel amazing?

650
00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:51.120
Like don't fucking know what he's talking about.

651
00:17:51.121 --> 00:17:52.440
Like I was on drugs,

652
00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:54.780
like coming back from that rainy,

653
00:17:54.781 --> 00:17:58.410
miserable cold five days to come back to la.

654
00:17:58.411 --> 00:17:59.850
Felt like I was on drugs.

655
00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:02.040
It was because I realized that like we had a,

656
00:18:02.041 --> 00:18:02.401
first of all,

657
00:18:02.401 --> 00:18:04.560
we had a great time being rainy and miserable,

658
00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:06.540
laughing our asses off.

659
00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:08.940
It was moving when I saw Steve [inaudible] at the end of that say,

660
00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:09.151
you know,

661
00:18:09.151 --> 00:18:14.151
I kind of Ms. Bryan and Joe's comedy because being up here alone,

662
00:18:14.521 --> 00:18:15.750
there's a profound sadness.

663
00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:16.320
I feel.

664
00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:17.520
I feel that way too.

665
00:18:17.521 --> 00:18:17.821
Actually.

666
00:18:17.821 --> 00:18:18.540
Did you feel that?

667
00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:19.410
Like very sad.

668
00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:21.270
I feel so sad when I look out.

669
00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:21.781
I have,

670
00:18:21.781 --> 00:18:23.910
maybe I feel so alone or I feel like,

671
00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:25.170
um,

672
00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:29.950
what it was would be like to live in such solitude in such silence was time.

673
00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:31.380
Totally humbling.

674
00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:33.180
It's totally humbling.

675
00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:37.140
And I feel like I might be totally bullshitting here.

676
00:18:37.141 --> 00:18:37.560
Okay.

677
00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:38.250
And I'm going to,

678
00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:39.390
we'll new admit that.

679
00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:41.490
But I feel like when,

680
00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:43.260
even if I'm in a beautiful park,

681
00:18:43.261 --> 00:18:43.731
like setting,

682
00:18:43.731 --> 00:18:46.080
like if you go to Griffith Park and you're sitting up in there,

683
00:18:46.081 --> 00:18:49.830
even if you find yourself a swath of land where all you see is trees and you're

684
00:18:49.831 --> 00:18:50.664
sitting down,

685
00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:52.440
there's still,

686
00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:57.180
there's a feeling in the air of civilization and the feeling of the air of

687
00:18:57.181 --> 00:18:57.781
civilization.

688
00:18:57.781 --> 00:19:00.720
I don't know if it's Wifi signals or radio signals,

689
00:19:00.721 --> 00:19:02.610
a television signals or cellular signals.

690
00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:03.151
I don't,

691
00:19:03.151 --> 00:19:05.400
and I don't know if it's an actual physical thing.

692
00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:08.100
I don't know if there's a feeling that you get,

693
00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:11.310
obviously you can't tune in to someone's cell phone with your fucking brain,

694
00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:16.520
but are you aware in some sort of weird peripheral sense that all these signals

695
00:19:17.941 --> 00:19:19.260
are around you all the time?

696
00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:20.131
I don't know,

697
00:19:20.131 --> 00:19:25.050
but I know that it feels totally different to be outside on a mountain in Prince

698
00:19:25.051 --> 00:19:25.884
of Wales.

699
00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:28.650
There's a feeling in the air and there's this,

700
00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:29.940
this first of all,

701
00:19:29.941 --> 00:19:31.680
this very humbling,

702
00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:32.820
absolute,

703
00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:37.020
undeniable realization that not only are you not special,

704
00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:40.410
but that this part of the world does not give a fuck about that.

705
00:19:40.411 --> 00:19:41.011
So I was going to say,

706
00:19:41.011 --> 00:19:42.120
and we'll forget about you,

707
00:19:42.121 --> 00:19:43.620
the moment you stop existing,

708
00:19:43.621 --> 00:19:45.030
you're so insignificant,

709
00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:50.210
so in you're so insignificant and I think a lot of my sadness came from feeling

710
00:19:51.001 --> 00:19:55.800
like being on par with a tree next to me.

711
00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:59.100
I'm that anonymous on that insignificant and there's nothing around here that

712
00:19:59.101 --> 00:19:59.934
cares about me.

713
00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:01.920
Maybe that's an egocentric way to look at it,

714
00:20:01.921 --> 00:20:04.290
but it certainly was very real and felt that way.

715
00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:05.380
Um,

716
00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:05.910
and I just,

717
00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:06.743
I don't know.

718
00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:07.470
Uh,

719
00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:07.890
it's,

720
00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:08.191
it's,

721
00:20:08.191 --> 00:20:08.850
um,

722
00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:10.830
I think it was supposed to experience that.

723
00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:12.600
I think it keeps people in line.

724
00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:15.450
I think there's two things that we fucked up on as a,

725
00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:15.931
as a,

726
00:20:15.931 --> 00:20:16.764
as a race.

727
00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:17.370
Um,

728
00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:18.660
well many things obviously,

729
00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:21.600
but two things that we fucked up on the are rarely discussed.

730
00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:27.020
And I think one of them is that we have almost a built in need to be around

731
00:20:28.411 --> 00:20:29.040
nature.

732
00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:30.030
And when you're around nature,

733
00:20:30.031 --> 00:20:31.650
you get feelings from that,

734
00:20:31.651 --> 00:20:33.810
from that experience that are not,

735
00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:36.900
they're not described enough.

736
00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:39.830
They're not expanded upon enough.

737
00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:41.590
They're not endorsed and,

738
00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:43.860
and appreciate it enough.

739
00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:47.590
I think it's an integral part of being a person.

740
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:52.120
<v 0>And I think that when we're spending all of our times in these hard surfaces and</v>

741
00:20:52.121 --> 00:20:54.760
the straight lines and these things that we create,

742
00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:57.160
I just do not think it's good for you.

743
00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:59.920
I think it's your body's not designed for it.

744
00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:05.070
And I think there's some reward systems that you get from being out in,

745
00:21:05.441 --> 00:21:08.110
in these solitary environments.

746
00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:11.650
It's certainly what most of our history is.

747
00:21:11.651 --> 00:21:12.970
Very little stimulus.

748
00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:14.620
If you think about the amount of stimulus,

749
00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:19.650
auditory and visual stimulus you deal with every day from just blinking lights,

750
00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:20.710
uh,

751
00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:22.000
all the things you see,

752
00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:26.530
our very recent ancestors were not ever exposed to that.

753
00:21:26.531 --> 00:21:29.560
They say sometimes that we're exposed to more seamless than a day than some of

754
00:21:29.561 --> 00:21:31.820
our ancestors where their whole life in,

755
00:21:31.821 --> 00:21:34.060
in terms of how predictable,

756
00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:37.420
still a expansive their lives were.

757
00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:38.860
Where you didn't venture,

758
00:21:38.861 --> 00:21:40.270
you couldn't venture too far.

759
00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:41.473
You know,

760
00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:42.820
the other thing about where we were,

761
00:21:42.821 --> 00:21:47.080
especially in Prince of Wales island was that not even native Americans would go

762
00:21:47.081 --> 00:21:47.914
up there.

763
00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:48.760
In fact,

764
00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:50.500
even animals would be like,

765
00:21:50.501 --> 00:21:50.921
you know what?

766
00:21:50.921 --> 00:21:51.700
Too rainy up here.

767
00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:53.050
We're going to go down below.

768
00:21:53.290 --> 00:21:58.000
So we were kind of truly where no one in their right mind would Canelo he's

769
00:21:58.001 --> 00:21:59.530
fucking maniac the mountain goat.

770
00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:00.750
He's a fucking maniac.

771
00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:02.350
That look legit maniac,

772
00:22:02.351 --> 00:22:05.460
a long suffering mountain waiting to get Claudia grizzly.

773
00:22:05.461 --> 00:22:05.690
The,

774
00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:07.360
I remember there was one of the first things he told me,

775
00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:10.030
I get clawed like right across the chest,

776
00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:11.920
like right chair and was like,

777
00:22:11.921 --> 00:22:13.570
what the fuck are you talking about?

778
00:22:13.571 --> 00:22:13.781
Man,

779
00:22:13.781 --> 00:22:14.620
if that happens,

780
00:22:14.621 --> 00:22:15.670
you're most likely dead.

781
00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:16.533
He's amazing.

782
00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:16.811
Yeah.

783
00:22:16.811 --> 00:22:19.240
I wonder if he feels differently now that he got run over by a moose.

784
00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:22.070
Did you ever see that episode moves?

785
00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:23.500
Got Him fucked.

786
00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:26.920
Moose charged him and got behind him and fucking nailed him in the ass.

787
00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:29.710
They're not friendly animals to Hillary shot it.

788
00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:30.790
It was already shot at.

789
00:22:30.791 --> 00:22:31.121
Yeah,

790
00:22:31.121 --> 00:22:34.990
it was down and wounded and he walked up on a wounded Moose and it ran at him

791
00:22:34.991 --> 00:22:35.561
and his gun.

792
00:22:35.561 --> 00:22:36.700
Misfired wow,

793
00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:37.773
dude.

794
00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:38.800
Yeah,

795
00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:39.251
Dude.

796
00:22:39.251 --> 00:22:40.180
I mean that's death.

797
00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:40.391
I mean,

798
00:22:40.391 --> 00:22:42.430
you could really easily get stomped to death.

799
00:22:42.450 --> 00:22:42.970
Yeah.

800
00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:43.780
If I,

801
00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:47.050
if I had it watch just watching the video,

802
00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:52.470
I did not have a sense of how truly big they are when you see one in real life.

803
00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:53.760
I have,

804
00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:55.750
and I had not seen what,

805
00:22:55.751 --> 00:22:58.480
I don't think I had seen one before a hunted them.

806
00:22:58.640 --> 00:22:58.760
Uh,

807
00:22:58.760 --> 00:22:59.500
maybe I,

808
00:22:59.500 --> 00:22:59.921
oh no,

809
00:22:59.921 --> 00:23:01.400
I have for sure your care.

810
00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:05.500
I have for sure because I was with Ari and we took pictures of him in Alaska,

811
00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:06.460
but it was females.

812
00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:08.920
I hadn't seen one with the full antlers before.

813
00:23:08.921 --> 00:23:10.480
It was in the summer and it was females.

814
00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:11.410
Um,

815
00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:12.161
and they were really,

816
00:23:12.161 --> 00:23:12.461
really,

817
00:23:12.461 --> 00:23:13.091
really big.

818
00:23:13.091 --> 00:23:16.630
But the ones that we saw when we were in BC like fucking Christ,

819
00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:20.470
just think about shooting that thing and this is work Rinella was in BC to

820
00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:22.960
shooting that thing that it stomps you.

821
00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:23.561
Yeah,

822
00:23:23.561 --> 00:23:24.250
no thanks.

823
00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:25.210
Fuck man.

824
00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:27.100
That starts so goddamn big.

825
00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:27.640
Yeah.

826
00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:29.620
The one I got was 900 pounds.

827
00:23:29.621 --> 00:23:32.680
The one my friend Ben O'brian got was 1400 pounds,

828
00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:34.140
1400 pound,

829
00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:36.160
1400 pounds I think.

830
00:23:36.161 --> 00:23:36.931
I think a horse,

831
00:23:36.931 --> 00:23:40.220
the average horse ways like 1,102,

832
00:23:40.221 --> 00:23:41.230
it was so big.

833
00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:46.250
She walked out into the road in front of us and the charge that you get,

834
00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:48.110
<v 1>the adrenaline charge,</v>

835
00:23:48.111 --> 00:23:48.861
when you see one,

836
00:23:48.861 --> 00:23:50.180
you're like cheese us.

837
00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:51.620
They didn't even look real.

838
00:23:51.621 --> 00:23:52.830
They were both the same size.

839
00:23:52.831 --> 00:23:54.560
They're both these enormous bachelor's.

840
00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:57.680
It was right after they had got done running and say they were just eating like

841
00:23:57.681 --> 00:23:58.101
crazy.

842
00:23:58.101 --> 00:24:01.100
There were starved because they've been fucking for weeks and weeks and weeks

843
00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:04.400
and they walked out into the middle of the road and we slammed the brakes in the

844
00:24:04.401 --> 00:24:08.450
car and you look at them like their body was bigger than the top of the tree.

845
00:24:08.451 --> 00:24:11.510
It was like up to like the windshield area of the trustees.

846
00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:14.060
They're insane how big they are by the way.

847
00:24:14.061 --> 00:24:14.270
He,

848
00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:17.510
we were talking about your first reaction to Caitlyn Jenner.

849
00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:17.751
Yeah,

850
00:24:17.751 --> 00:24:17.931
no,

851
00:24:17.931 --> 00:24:18.111
no,

852
00:24:18.111 --> 00:24:18.860
I'm going to get back to,

853
00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:19.041
Oh,

854
00:24:19.041 --> 00:24:19.490
you are?

855
00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:20.270
Yeah.

856
00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:23.570
The other thing that I was going to say is I think we are,

857
00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:26.900
and I want this to be like,

858
00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:30.530
I'm trying to be as objective about this as possible and I'm trying to be as

859
00:24:30.531 --> 00:24:32.120
sensitive about this as possible,

860
00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:33.800
but I think,

861
00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:39.490
I think all this move towards the feminine and demonizing masculine behavior and

862
00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:43.341
all of this,

863
00:24:43.341 --> 00:24:44.000
um,

864
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:44.271
uh,

865
00:24:44.271 --> 00:24:48.500
appreciation for marginalized people is all,

866
00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:50.300
it's all awesome.

867
00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:51.920
I really think it's important.

868
00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:56.540
I think people go too crazy with it and they attack people that would ordinarily

869
00:24:56.541 --> 00:24:57.530
be their allies.

870
00:24:57.890 --> 00:25:02.270
But I think that would all this is doing like the reason why this move towards

871
00:25:02.271 --> 00:25:03.130
acceptance is,

872
00:25:03.131 --> 00:25:03.964
is happening.

873
00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:07.970
It's because I think we're evolving and I think that as people are evolving and

874
00:25:07.971 --> 00:25:11.720
as we realized that there really is no right or wrong way to live.

875
00:25:11.721 --> 00:25:14.810
And if Bruce Jenner wants to be a woman now who gives a fuck,

876
00:25:14.811 --> 00:25:16.100
he should totally be a woman.

877
00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:17.630
I think this is,

878
00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:22.690
this is all a positive thing and it's all moving towards some softer style of

879
00:25:24.261 --> 00:25:25.730
being a human being.

880
00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:26.930
And um,

881
00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:28.730
it probably won't be within our lifetime,

882
00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:31.340
but I think several lifetimes from now,

883
00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:35.930
people are probably going to be way kinder on a regular basis than they are

884
00:25:35.931 --> 00:25:36.620
right now.

885
00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:38.960
I think they're way kinder today than they've ever been before.

886
00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:43.910
Way more aware of things now than they've ever been for me to empathize because

887
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.170
we have too much information to know how similar we are to say a white guy as to

888
00:25:48.171 --> 00:25:49.010
a Chinese person,

889
00:25:49.011 --> 00:25:49.671
to a black person.

890
00:25:49.671 --> 00:25:50.780
And it's just right.

891
00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:52.070
It's hard to deny that.

892
00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:53.810
You rarely see somebody arguing that.

893
00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:56.150
And this is where I think the divide comes in.

894
00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:57.471
There's a,

895
00:25:57.471 --> 00:26:02.471
there's an anti masculinity fee feeling and like that,

896
00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:03.261
you know,

897
00:26:03.261 --> 00:26:07.300
men who are into things are jocks and meatheads and assholes.

898
00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:10.340
And if you're into sports or martial arts or other,

899
00:26:10.341 --> 00:26:11.690
that somehow or another,

900
00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:14.060
because you embrace this,

901
00:26:14.061 --> 00:26:17.960
it excites you and you enjoy it and you are surround yourself with other people

902
00:26:17.961 --> 00:26:18.920
that also enjoy it.

903
00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:20.600
There must be something wrong with you.

904
00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:22.730
You must be a mean person.

905
00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:24.440
Like just because you're masculine,

906
00:26:24.441 --> 00:26:25.280
you must be mean.

907
00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:26.870
I reject that outright.

908
00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:31.070
I think it's ridiculous that also you must be insensitive and cruel.

909
00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:32.930
I reject that as well outright.

910
00:26:32.931 --> 00:26:33.764
It's not true.

911
00:26:33.770 --> 00:26:34.603
It's not true.

912
00:26:34.670 --> 00:26:35.810
You can be masculine,

913
00:26:35.811 --> 00:26:36.260
obese,

914
00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:37.093
very sensitive.

915
00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:41.540
Did I had to do this fucking thing for the UFC yesterday where it was a speech

916
00:26:41.541 --> 00:26:44.520
about the hall of fame and Jeff Blatnick is,

917
00:26:44.521 --> 00:26:44.790
uh,

918
00:26:44.790 --> 00:26:47.280
getting into the hall of fame and Jeff Blatnick,

919
00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:49.830
who's an Olympic gold medalist,

920
00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:51.330
Greco Alexander,

921
00:26:51.331 --> 00:26:52.560
Carolyn and uh,

922
00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:53.850
and Greco Roman,

923
00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:55.043
who's a,

924
00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:56.760
this amazing guy.

925
00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:58.793
And um,

926
00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:00.030
I started crying.

927
00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:00.511
I was like,

928
00:27:00.511 --> 00:27:04.180
I had to stop myself from crying when I was talking about this guy because he

929
00:27:04.181 --> 00:27:05.970
beat cancer and won a gold medal.

930
00:27:05.971 --> 00:27:07.740
And then he was like really nice to me,

931
00:27:07.741 --> 00:27:08.400
man.

932
00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:11.070
Like when I first started wearing big Jeff,

933
00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:14.700
who's a great guy and so I'm a bitch dude.

934
00:27:14.701 --> 00:27:15.810
I cry all the time.

935
00:27:15.811 --> 00:27:16.470
I cried.

936
00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:16.651
I'm,

937
00:27:16.651 --> 00:27:16.831
I'm,

938
00:27:16.831 --> 00:27:19.740
I'm emotional like about a lot of shit all the time,

939
00:27:19.741 --> 00:27:20.120
man.

940
00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:23.340
A movie or even some songs will get me,

941
00:27:23.341 --> 00:27:25.540
I'll be in my car and a song or make me fucking crying.

942
00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:31.370
It doesn't mean because someone embraces masculine activities,

943
00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:34.320
whether it's martial arts or whether it's,

944
00:27:34.321 --> 00:27:34.880
um,

945
00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:36.660
hunting or anything,

946
00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:39.810
it doesn't mean that that person's going to be homophobic.

947
00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:44.500
It doesn't mean that that person is going to be a negative person or,

948
00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:46.230
but there's this push,

949
00:27:46.530 --> 00:27:50.400
I think because of what's happening now with,

950
00:27:50.401 --> 00:27:50.820
um,

951
00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:52.230
with all this,

952
00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:57.300
our society's movement towards civilization and movement towards a much more

953
00:27:57.301 --> 00:27:58.470
nonviolent life,

954
00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:00.630
although the awareness of rape man.

955
00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:04.530
But there hadn't been a lot of rape going on in college when I was young,

956
00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:06.000
but I never fucking heard about it.

957
00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:10.470
But all you're hearing about it like on a constant basis is the amount of sexual

958
00:28:10.471 --> 00:28:12.090
violence that takes place in colleges.

959
00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:14.670
And some people are saying they're overreacting to this,

960
00:28:14.671 --> 00:28:15.270
that,

961
00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:16.650
but it's good.

962
00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:20.010
Like it's all this trend of like revving the voices.

963
00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:21.420
The was the voice.

964
00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:22.680
Yes.

965
00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:24.210
And recognizing that,

966
00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:25.410
what is important here?

967
00:28:25.411 --> 00:28:26.790
Is it the style of life?

968
00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:28.140
Is it the style of life you live?

969
00:28:28.330 --> 00:28:28.990
Is it a buy?

970
00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:30.350
Should I be mad at you if you wear a dress?

971
00:28:30.351 --> 00:28:31.080
No.

972
00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:31.201
Why?

973
00:28:31.201 --> 00:28:33.420
She'd be mad at you if you rape people that were dresses.

974
00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:36.300
I should be mad at you if you beat people up because you don't like the way they

975
00:28:36.301 --> 00:28:38.010
look like Twitter today.

976
00:28:38.011 --> 00:28:40.590
Some trans woman had a black eye.

977
00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:41.161
Uh,

978
00:28:41.161 --> 00:28:41.701
and there was some,

979
00:28:41.701 --> 00:28:41.911
you know,

980
00:28:41.911 --> 00:28:43.050
she made some tweet about it.

981
00:28:43.051 --> 00:28:43.890
I forget her name.

982
00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:44.181
I don't,

983
00:28:44.181 --> 00:28:44.581
I don't know.

984
00:28:44.581 --> 00:28:45.301
I don't follow her.

985
00:28:45.301 --> 00:28:45.601
I just,

986
00:28:45.601 --> 00:28:49.710
I clicked on a link and I found it and it was some guy punched her for being a

987
00:28:49.711 --> 00:28:50.700
transgender person.

988
00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:51.560
Just fun.

989
00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:53.360
<v 2>And Kristen Beck was on her podcast and talk.</v>

990
00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:53.660
I'm,

991
00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:56.690
I'm flattering kid and talked about getting beat up chest because she walked by

992
00:28:56.691 --> 00:28:57.524
some guys,

993
00:28:57.550 --> 00:29:00.200
seal team six commando and they had heard it from behind,

994
00:29:00.201 --> 00:29:01.011
but that,

995
00:29:01.011 --> 00:29:01.250
that,

996
00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:03.190
that's an everyday reality and every day,

997
00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:04.221
very,

998
00:29:04.221 --> 00:29:05.390
very short time ago,

999
00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:08.840
and I'm talking about less than 15 years ago and our lifetime,

1000
00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:12.950
any of those derogatory words like Fag Faggot,

1001
00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:15.680
making fun of gay people was an acceptable prejudice.

1002
00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:15.861
Oh,

1003
00:29:15.861 --> 00:29:17.180
you've heard it all the time.

1004
00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:20.810
All of us said it because you just made fun of people.

1005
00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:21.121
<v 1>Well,</v>

1006
00:29:21.121 --> 00:29:25.460
how bout like you go listen to like some old Eddie Murphy listen to behind raw.

1007
00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:26.400
Oh my God.

1008
00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:27.000
Yeah.

1009
00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:27.631
It's crazy.

1010
00:29:27.631 --> 00:29:29.790
Meanwhile it's like really like hate speech.

1011
00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:30.130
Yeah.

1012
00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:30.480
Yeah.

1013
00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:32.970
Meanwhile he likes it was allegedly,

1014
00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:34.050
allegedly.

1015
00:29:34.050 --> 00:29:34.650
Yeah.

1016
00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:34.771
Well,

1017
00:29:34.771 --> 00:29:35.640
you know what they say?

1018
00:29:38.350 --> 00:29:39.183
<v 2>Well,</v>

1019
00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:42.430
you know when you're talking about also is like Matthew Arnold who was this

1020
00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:45.670
awesome sort of philosopher romantic and he said,

1021
00:29:46.090 --> 00:29:46.541
yes,

1022
00:29:46.541 --> 00:29:48.100
the United States is the,

1023
00:29:48.101 --> 00:29:49.090
and forgive me if it's not Matthew,

1024
00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:50.180
I'm almost positive it is,

1025
00:29:50.181 --> 00:29:50.321
is.

1026
00:29:50.321 --> 00:29:50.591
Yes.

1027
00:29:50.591 --> 00:29:53.740
The United States is a very powerful country with the biggest guns in a roaring

1028
00:29:53.741 --> 00:29:54.431
stock market.

1029
00:29:54.431 --> 00:29:56.140
And the national football league.

1030
00:29:56.770 --> 00:29:58.870
But somewhere along the line,

1031
00:29:58.871 --> 00:30:00.190
if you embrace all of that,

1032
00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:01.630
you'll forget to be interesting.

1033
00:30:02.170 --> 00:30:04.060
And you have to remember as a country,

1034
00:30:04.061 --> 00:30:04.990
as a society,

1035
00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:09.850
that you must make place for the gentler spirits for your artists,

1036
00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:13.210
for your quote Unquote Weirdos for dreamers,

1037
00:30:13.211 --> 00:30:14.050
for your wonders.

1038
00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:14.561
And,

1039
00:30:14.561 --> 00:30:14.971
and I,

1040
00:30:14.971 --> 00:30:15.910
I think that's,

1041
00:30:15.911 --> 00:30:16.780
to our credit that,

1042
00:30:16.810 --> 00:30:17.050
that,

1043
00:30:17.050 --> 00:30:17.680
you know,

1044
00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:19.240
it does create more beauty.

1045
00:30:19.241 --> 00:30:21.600
It does create a more diversity of,

1046
00:30:21.610 --> 00:30:26.260
creates more interesting innovation when people who don't have the biggest

1047
00:30:26.261 --> 00:30:28.270
muscles feel safe,

1048
00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:30.060
feel like they have a voice,

1049
00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:31.450
feel like they have somewhere to go.

1050
00:30:31.450 --> 00:30:33.040
If they get beat up.

1051
00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:35.860
You have a society where muscles and guns,

1052
00:30:35.890 --> 00:30:36.101
I,

1053
00:30:36.101 --> 00:30:36.341
he,

1054
00:30:36.341 --> 00:30:36.960
Rome,

1055
00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:37.150
I,

1056
00:30:37.150 --> 00:30:37.421
he,

1057
00:30:37.421 --> 00:30:38.254
Russia,

1058
00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:38.800
yeah,

1059
00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:41.260
we're muscles and ground guns ruled the roost.

1060
00:30:41.261 --> 00:30:42.460
And that most of the world,

1061
00:30:42.461 --> 00:30:42.820
by the way,

1062
00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:45.400
when all these guys that are getting beaten up in Russia for being gay,

1063
00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:47.050
it's like a really common she,

1064
00:30:47.051 --> 00:30:47.740
exactly.

1065
00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:48.820
So anytime you,

1066
00:30:48.821 --> 00:30:53.140
most societies concern themselves almost exclusively with how to control their

1067
00:30:53.141 --> 00:30:54.010
populations,

1068
00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:58.060
whether they do it through sheer force like Russia does or whether they do it

1069
00:30:58.061 --> 00:30:58.640
through,

1070
00:30:58.640 --> 00:30:59.410
um,

1071
00:30:59.410 --> 00:31:01.030
religion like Saudi Arabia.

1072
00:31:01.031 --> 00:31:05.530
Does those countries essentially practice a form of apartheid?

1073
00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:08.020
And what I mean by that is at 50% of their population,

1074
00:31:08.021 --> 00:31:11.530
at least to say nothing of the gay people and the different people in the

1075
00:31:11.531 --> 00:31:12.700
transgender people,

1076
00:31:13.090 --> 00:31:17.530
those people are so marginalized and they're wasted because they're put in one

1077
00:31:17.531 --> 00:31:22.090
place and they're told to do just a couple of things that have been allowed by

1078
00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:23.520
this male,

1079
00:31:23.890 --> 00:31:24.340
um,

1080
00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:25.180
architecture.

1081
00:31:25.270 --> 00:31:28.060
This male scaffolding has been put in place and been there forever.

1082
00:31:28.330 --> 00:31:31.750
And it just stifles spirit.

1083
00:31:31.930 --> 00:31:34.720
It stifles ingenuity,

1084
00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:35.471
creativity,

1085
00:31:35.471 --> 00:31:36.670
and most of all,

1086
00:31:36.671 --> 00:31:37.870
it stifles the truth.

1087
00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:40.390
And in that sense,

1088
00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:40.961
you know,

1089
00:31:40.961 --> 00:31:44.020
of course there's a place for these people in these societies have evolved.

1090
00:31:44.021 --> 00:31:46.960
And there's a lot of great things about Russian society and Saudi society and

1091
00:31:46.961 --> 00:31:47.381
everything else.

1092
00:31:47.381 --> 00:31:50.290
But that's an important aspect to keep in mind.

1093
00:31:50.291 --> 00:31:50.481
That's,

1094
00:31:50.481 --> 00:31:51.550
that's an important thing.

1095
00:31:51.610 --> 00:31:55.420
And that's what I think this movement is a positive thing.

1096
00:31:55.450 --> 00:31:55.601
Well,

1097
00:31:55.601 --> 00:31:56.890
it's about information.

1098
00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:57.370
You know,

1099
00:31:57.370 --> 00:32:00.760
these people have a voice now and you start thinking of them as people as

1100
00:32:00.761 --> 00:32:01.540
opposed to like,

1101
00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:05.080
like transgender people never had a community before that.

1102
00:32:05.081 --> 00:32:05.740
I mean what,

1103
00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:09.460
how would they would have to find other transgender people and hang out with

1104
00:32:09.461 --> 00:32:09.660
them.

1105
00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:12.070
It would be very difficult to get that going.

1106
00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:14.140
Now you meet online,

1107
00:32:14.141 --> 00:32:15.280
you have these forums,

1108
00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:17.740
have Twitter and things along those lines.

1109
00:32:17.741 --> 00:32:22.741
Like well that's from any weird generally marginalized parts of society can find

1110
00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:24.570
a community.

1111
00:32:24.570 --> 00:32:26.650
Now did you and Nick Swardson this choker?

1112
00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:27.730
I believe it's on a specialist,

1113
00:32:27.731 --> 00:32:28.170
so I'm not,

1114
00:32:28.170 --> 00:32:28.690
I don't get that.

1115
00:32:28.690 --> 00:32:30.010
He goes for the Internet.

1116
00:32:30.011 --> 00:32:30.740
If you had a fetish,

1117
00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:34.150
it kinda sucked because you kind of had to kind of try it out on the person.

1118
00:32:34.151 --> 00:32:35.290
You'd be at dinner and you'd be like,

1119
00:32:35.291 --> 00:32:35.501
all right,

1120
00:32:35.501 --> 00:32:36.334
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

1121
00:32:36.510 --> 00:32:36.790
Torque.

1122
00:32:36.790 --> 00:32:37.900
It was joke on the air.

1123
00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:38.860
I think he's already done this.

1124
00:32:39.250 --> 00:32:40.083
Yeah,

1125
00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:41.210
<v 0>I wouldn't know otherwise.</v>

1126
00:32:41.211 --> 00:32:41.870
But he goes,

1127
00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:45.440
well I'm gonna go to the bathroom or it could piss on your face just getting,

1128
00:32:45.441 --> 00:32:46.380
just getting any luck.

1129
00:32:48.270 --> 00:32:48.770
It's like,

1130
00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:49.910
it's so fucking true.

1131
00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:50.841
That's so true.

1132
00:32:50.841 --> 00:32:51.674
You have find it.

1133
00:32:52.050 --> 00:32:52.391
But my,

1134
00:32:52.391 --> 00:32:53.760
my feeling with the Caitlyn Jenner thing,

1135
00:32:53.761 --> 00:32:54.830
it was only that,

1136
00:32:54.890 --> 00:32:55.700
um,

1137
00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:58.720
I kind of felt like there are two things that go on in my mind now.

1138
00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:03.170
This one is that I found that he was,

1139
00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:05.780
she was now it looked like I have a bit of 35,

1140
00:33:05.781 --> 00:33:06.501
not 65.

1141
00:33:06.501 --> 00:33:07.011
That was good.

1142
00:33:07.011 --> 00:33:07.591
Photoshop.

1143
00:33:07.591 --> 00:33:07.791
Well,

1144
00:33:07.791 --> 00:33:08.061
you know,

1145
00:33:08.061 --> 00:33:13.061
the other thing is he underwent a 12 hour surgery to more feminized his face.

1146
00:33:13.971 --> 00:33:15.740
Apparently up until now.

1147
00:33:15.770 --> 00:33:17.060
He preferred the feet,

1148
00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:18.170
the he pronoun.

1149
00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:18.861
I don't,

1150
00:33:18.861 --> 00:33:20.630
I don't know if he's saying she know.

1151
00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:21.650
I believe she is.

1152
00:33:21.770 --> 00:33:23.180
It's Miss Jenner if you don't mind.

1153
00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:23.930
She,

1154
00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:24.260
yeah.

1155
00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:25.100
So what you're saying,

1156
00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:25.993
I'm saying she,

1157
00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:28.040
and again and again I am by the way,

1158
00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:28.380
your,

1159
00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:28.670
your,

1160
00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:30.500
your face and your tone.

1161
00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:35.010
I must piggy back because the thing that I resent a little bit,

1162
00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:36.263
I was a little bit,

1163
00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:36.741
he said,

1164
00:33:36.741 --> 00:33:37.940
I'm not even allowed to think.

1165
00:33:37.941 --> 00:33:39.770
It's a little weird and a little strange.

1166
00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:41.750
And I do find it a little weird.

1167
00:33:42.790 --> 00:33:44.510
I've known him as Bruce Jenner,

1168
00:33:44.511 --> 00:33:44.931
and by the way,

1169
00:33:44.931 --> 00:33:46.480
I wish I had his body because I'd be,

1170
00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:47.300
no,

1171
00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:47.540
no,

1172
00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:48.260
not now.

1173
00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:49.520
Just before Jesus.

1174
00:33:49.521 --> 00:33:50.271
Even before.

1175
00:33:50.271 --> 00:33:51.640
Do you ever see him walking around Malibu?

1176
00:33:51.641 --> 00:33:52.550
It's a disaster.

1177
00:33:54.090 --> 00:33:54.650
Barbri.

1178
00:33:54.650 --> 00:33:55.400
Neglect.

1179
00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:56.130
Oh yeah.

1180
00:33:56.130 --> 00:33:57.310
It was just the whole thing is falling.

1181
00:33:57.311 --> 00:33:58.520
He was taking the estrogen dude,

1182
00:33:58.521 --> 00:33:59.354
give him a break.

1183
00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:00.450
How long was he doing that?

1184
00:34:00.690 --> 00:34:02.450
They apparently for a very long time.

1185
00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:06.930
Really like how long I heard 20 years isn't making money.

1186
00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:07.361
Yes.

1187
00:34:07.361 --> 00:34:08.121
It's crazy.

1188
00:34:08.121 --> 00:34:09.900
So she was letting that beautiful,

1189
00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:11.420
that beautiful machine.

1190
00:34:11.870 --> 00:34:14.210
It was just putting on a layer of feminine fat and that's fine.

1191
00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:15.413
Whoa,

1192
00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:16.131
am I,

1193
00:34:16.131 --> 00:34:16.791
am I bad?

1194
00:34:16.791 --> 00:34:17.780
I'm not a bad person,

1195
00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:18.271
you know,

1196
00:34:18.271 --> 00:34:19.460
like support anybody.

1197
00:34:19.461 --> 00:34:20.294
I protect him.

1198
00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:22.610
I protect anybody's right to do what they want like that,

1199
00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:24.020
but I'm allowed to feel,

1200
00:34:24.021 --> 00:34:26.060
it's a little strange.

1201
00:34:26.090 --> 00:34:27.080
I'm allowed to kind of go,

1202
00:34:27.081 --> 00:34:29.810
I have to call him miss now he got a boob job,

1203
00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:30.230
right?

1204
00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:30.590
Yeah.

1205
00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:31.423
It's weird.

1206
00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:32.151
I'm just think about it.

1207
00:34:32.151 --> 00:34:34.160
He's got kids and I feel for his kids.

1208
00:34:34.161 --> 00:34:35.810
I'm sure they are accepting or whatever,

1209
00:34:35.811 --> 00:34:37.490
but it's gotta be weird.

1210
00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:38.930
Even Kristen Beck said,

1211
00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:39.771
it is weird.

1212
00:34:39.771 --> 00:34:41.120
I can't even figure it out myself.

1213
00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:42.410
You know?

1214
00:34:42.410 --> 00:34:43.243
I don't know.

1215
00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:43.910
It is weird.

1216
00:34:43.910 --> 00:34:48.410
It's definitely weird and I think that anything that you can't make fun of this

1217
00:34:48.411 --> 00:34:49.244
bullshit.

1218
00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:50.750
Like if you can't make fun of it,

1219
00:34:50.751 --> 00:34:50.951
you can,

1220
00:34:50.951 --> 00:34:52.250
you can make fun of everything.

1221
00:34:52.490 --> 00:34:54.570
You can make fun of jobs,

1222
00:34:54.650 --> 00:34:55.790
you can make fun of sex,

1223
00:34:55.791 --> 00:34:57.050
you can make fun of gender,

1224
00:34:57.260 --> 00:34:58.520
you make fun of transgender,

1225
00:34:58.521 --> 00:34:59.390
you make fun of everything.

1226
00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:01.190
Don't say he can't make fun of it because that's,

1227
00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:02.240
that's nonsense.

1228
00:35:02.241 --> 00:35:02.840
Then you're,

1229
00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:04.100
you're losing out on free speech.

1230
00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:05.210
And by the way,

1231
00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:06.620
the best way,

1232
00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:11.770
the best way to marginalize something is to not be allowed to talk about it.

1233
00:35:12.290 --> 00:35:13.340
Like it's you,

1234
00:35:13.341 --> 00:35:14.810
you change the thing,

1235
00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:16.250
you make it a sacred thing.

1236
00:35:16.251 --> 00:35:19.010
You don't make it a thing that you could talk about and discuss.

1237
00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:21.260
So you don't even know if the thing that you're talking about,

1238
00:35:21.261 --> 00:35:21.740
if it's,

1239
00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:22.700
if it's honest,

1240
00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:25.880
are we being honest about what is happening here?

1241
00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:30.110
Because for every person who does everything in life,

1242
00:35:30.111 --> 00:35:30.944
that's weird.

1243
00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:34.130
There's gonna be people that love it and there's going to be people that hate

1244
00:35:34.131 --> 00:35:34.580
it,

1245
00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:37.500
but you don't know what it is until everybody sits down and talks about it.

1246
00:35:37.501 --> 00:35:37.651
Like,

1247
00:35:37.651 --> 00:35:38.040
why is this

1248
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:39.720
<v 1>kid wants so much fucking tension?</v>

1249
00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:40.080
Oh,

1250
00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:41.190
he's an attention whore.

1251
00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:45.150
And we figured out and we all discuss it when it comes to sexual things,

1252
00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:46.830
sexual aspects of behavior,

1253
00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:49.590
then we get ultra super sensitive.

1254
00:35:49.591 --> 00:35:50.040
Yeah.

1255
00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:51.430
We get really sensitive,

1256
00:35:51.850 --> 00:35:53.670
much more sensitive than anything else we do.

1257
00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:54.960
Whether it's behavior,

1258
00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:56.310
whether it's occupation.

1259
00:35:56.430 --> 00:35:58.950
When you get down to sexual and gender things,

1260
00:35:58.951 --> 00:35:59.491
people like,

1261
00:35:59.491 --> 00:35:59.761
well,

1262
00:35:59.761 --> 00:35:59.971
Whoa,

1263
00:35:59.971 --> 00:36:00.241
whoa,

1264
00:36:00.241 --> 00:36:00.451
Whoa,

1265
00:36:00.451 --> 00:36:00.900
whoa.

1266
00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:02.070
Don't talk about that.

1267
00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:03.690
You can make fun of lawyers all you want.

1268
00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:05.520
We probably going to need lawyers,

1269
00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:08.110
but you can make all the dead lawyer jokes you fucking,

1270
00:36:08.111 --> 00:36:08.640
you want,

1271
00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:10.710
you can throw lawyers in the bottom of the ocean.

1272
00:36:10.711 --> 00:36:12.810
You could talk about gunning them all down the streets.

1273
00:36:12.811 --> 00:36:13.644
Like dogs.

1274
00:36:13.770 --> 00:36:17.580
You could be a fucking blogger for like the Huffington post and you should say,

1275
00:36:17.581 --> 00:36:18.570
damn the lawyers,

1276
00:36:18.571 --> 00:36:20.220
we should gunned them down like dogs.

1277
00:36:20.430 --> 00:36:25.140
And you could say that and no one is going to get angry at you and no one's

1278
00:36:25.141 --> 00:36:27.530
going to march against you and no one's going to call it.

1279
00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:29.940
[inaudible] is a blog called kill all the lawyers.

1280
00:36:29.941 --> 00:36:30.960
It's taken from Shakespeare.

1281
00:36:30.961 --> 00:36:31.380
You Go,

1282
00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:34.980
now imagine if you said kill all the transgender people.

1283
00:36:35.070 --> 00:36:35.251
Like,

1284
00:36:35.251 --> 00:36:36.084
whoa.

1285
00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:39.030
Well what if a transgender dude sucked your Dick?

1286
00:36:39.390 --> 00:36:40.223
And uh,

1287
00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:42.210
you found out about it and you were really mad.

1288
00:36:42.250 --> 00:36:43.230
So you started a blog,

1289
00:36:43.231 --> 00:36:44.430
kill all the transgenders.

1290
00:36:44.850 --> 00:36:46.560
Like what the fuck man?

1291
00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:47.543
No people would,

1292
00:36:47.610 --> 00:36:51.690
people would freak out because when you want to kill somebody based on sex or

1293
00:36:51.691 --> 00:36:52.291
gender,

1294
00:36:52.291 --> 00:36:57.040
if you have anger towards them because of sex or gender becomes very charged.

1295
00:36:57.630 --> 00:36:58.440
Very child.

1296
00:36:58.440 --> 00:36:59.251
Did I mention that?

1297
00:36:59.251 --> 00:37:00.630
Did I mentioned that there was a guy,

1298
00:37:00.631 --> 00:37:01.321
I'm acting class,

1299
00:37:01.321 --> 00:37:04.260
he used to dress in drag and a very beautiful,

1300
00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:07.770
amazing and was very elegant.

1301
00:37:07.770 --> 00:37:09.480
And I always elegance a good word.

1302
00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:11.940
He was an elegant man.

1303
00:37:12.370 --> 00:37:13.203
And,

1304
00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:15.000
and one day he goes,

1305
00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:20.150
he looked at me and I had done a scene in acting class and he said that was sexy

1306
00:37:20.371 --> 00:37:20.820
baby.

1307
00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:21.241
And I go,

1308
00:37:21.241 --> 00:37:21.571
Oh yeah,

1309
00:37:21.571 --> 00:37:22.404
you think so?

1310
00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:23.430
You Better Watch out.

1311
00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:24.001
And he goes,

1312
00:37:24.001 --> 00:37:24.691
you better watch out.

1313
00:37:24.691 --> 00:37:26.290
Put Your Dick Cannon balls in my mouth up.

1314
00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:27.280
I got told us,

1315
00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:29.370
he just turned on me.

1316
00:37:29.371 --> 00:37:29.820
I was like,

1317
00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:30.540
what?

1318
00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:30.841
I put,

1319
00:37:30.841 --> 00:37:31.171
I put them,

1320
00:37:31.171 --> 00:37:32.004
I put them all in.

1321
00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:34.493
Whoa.

1322
00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:38.040
I thought I talked about on my podcast what to Dick and balls in my mouth.

1323
00:37:38.370 --> 00:37:38.700
Oh,

1324
00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:39.420
that's a lot of,

1325
00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:40.253
that's okay.

1326
00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:41.333
That's impressive.

1327
00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:43.200
It's probably hurt my balls,

1328
00:37:43.201 --> 00:37:43.740
but yeah,

1329
00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:44.730
that wouldn't be comfortable.

1330
00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:45.311
I don't think so.

1331
00:37:45.311 --> 00:37:46.290
His teeth for sure.

1332
00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:47.820
It was very normal size by the way.

1333
00:37:47.821 --> 00:37:48.510
I took a look.

1334
00:37:48.510 --> 00:37:52.110
Maybe he's like snakey stretched out ligaments or some shit.

1335
00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:52.861
He ended up being,

1336
00:37:52.861 --> 00:37:53.940
actually we dated for awhile.

1337
00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:54.893
Whoa.

1338
00:37:55.110 --> 00:37:57.270
How I turned out he wasn't to do,

1339
00:37:57.720 --> 00:37:58.650
but it's um,

1340
00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:00.090
there's like a weird charge.

1341
00:38:00.091 --> 00:38:03.270
Like racial hate is very similar in a way.

1342
00:38:03.430 --> 00:38:03.870
You know,

1343
00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:06.300
like there's a lot of charge to racial hate,

1344
00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:10.500
but there's some racial hate and kind of get away with like black people can say

1345
00:38:10.501 --> 00:38:12.900
some pretty nasty shit about white people and we let it slide.

1346
00:38:13.310 --> 00:38:15.540
You know like I saw this guy's Twitter,

1347
00:38:15.541 --> 00:38:19.170
some Spanish guy and he is a journalist and he was like,

1348
00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:19.241
ah,

1349
00:38:19.241 --> 00:38:21.600
I'm happy when all white shows get canceled.

1350
00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:22.411
And Mike,

1351
00:38:22.411 --> 00:38:25.320
could you imagine if someone said that about black shows?

1352
00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:25.740
Yeah,

1353
00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:26.450
you can't,

1354
00:38:26.450 --> 00:38:27.283
you know,

1355
00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:29.070
because Shelly,

1356
00:38:29.230 --> 00:38:29.880
why shabby?

1357
00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:30.581
Cause it's a,

1358
00:38:30.581 --> 00:38:33.810
an overpopulation but it's the point being,

1359
00:38:33.811 --> 00:38:34.440
it's like,

1360
00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:34.741
you know,

1361
00:38:34.741 --> 00:38:36.220
Cain Velasquez has this brown

1362
00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:39.420
<v 0>pride shirt or brown pipe tattoo doesn't have white power.</v>

1363
00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:41.410
He has well pride.

1364
00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:43.690
He has brown pride tattooed on his chest.

1365
00:38:43.691 --> 00:38:45.820
If you had white pride tattooed on your chest,

1366
00:38:45.821 --> 00:38:47.290
you would never be able to fight in the UFC.

1367
00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:47.770
True.

1368
00:38:47.770 --> 00:38:48.580
It's interesting.

1369
00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:49.810
You'd definitely have to explain yourself.

1370
00:38:49.870 --> 00:38:50.051
Yeah,

1371
00:38:50.051 --> 00:38:50.770
I mean I don't,

1372
00:38:50.770 --> 00:38:53.830
I don't think it's wrong because I think the sentiment behind it is right.

1373
00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:54.281
You know,

1374
00:38:54.281 --> 00:38:56.590
the sentiment about it behind it is that like,

1375
00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:58.240
like why are you proud about being white?

1376
00:38:58.270 --> 00:38:59.020
We're everywhere.

1377
00:38:59.020 --> 00:38:59.853
Let's relax.

1378
00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:00.560
Just relax.

1379
00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:02.910
I have to power relaxed.

1380
00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:04.830
And why are you upset that he's proud?

1381
00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:05.530
He's Mexican.

1382
00:39:05.530 --> 00:39:06.300
Relax.

1383
00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:06.581
You know?

1384
00:39:06.581 --> 00:39:07.091
But it's,

1385
00:39:07.091 --> 00:39:07.420
it's,

1386
00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:08.620
it's a double standard.

1387
00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:10.360
It is absolutely a double standard,

1388
00:39:10.361 --> 00:39:11.500
but it's the correct one.

1389
00:39:11.770 --> 00:39:12.603
It's interesting.

1390
00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:13.180
Yeah.

1391
00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:13.620
You know,

1392
00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:16.180
it's like things that's why things can't be,

1393
00:39:16.181 --> 00:39:17.680
can't be cut and dry.

1394
00:39:17.870 --> 00:39:21.490
It can't be the same for everybody because it's just not the same for everybody.

1395
00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:22.401
Now.

1396
00:39:22.401 --> 00:39:23.770
And what's interesting is that white,

1397
00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:25.240
I would imagine,

1398
00:39:25.241 --> 00:39:26.074
I think when they,

1399
00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:29.980
when California couldn't pass that proposition on gay marriage,

1400
00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:35.760
a lot of the opposition came from the black and brown communities because

1401
00:39:36.310 --> 00:39:38.440
especially Latino community is very religious.

1402
00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:40.860
Ari Shapiro to be a great joke about,

1403
00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:40.991
oh,

1404
00:39:40.991 --> 00:39:41.730
they did.

1405
00:39:41.730 --> 00:39:43.270
He had a great joke about he's dead right,

1406
00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:47.620
that African Americans voted like it was disproportionate amount of the voted

1407
00:39:47.621 --> 00:39:49.480
against gay marriage.

1408
00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:51.611
But again,

1409
00:39:51.611 --> 00:39:53.030
that can be granted and religion,

1410
00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:54.293
mission,

1411
00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:56.080
all those things you fear,

1412
00:39:56.081 --> 00:39:56.914
you know?

1413
00:39:56.980 --> 00:40:00.250
So there's a lot of nonsense when it comes to that stuff.

1414
00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:01.970
And I think all that's like,

1415
00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:02.380
again,

1416
00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:03.730
that's starting to dissolve.

1417
00:40:04.090 --> 00:40:08.290
I think it's starting to dissolve and I think even like the backlash that people

1418
00:40:08.291 --> 00:40:09.310
are getting for,

1419
00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:09.611
you know,

1420
00:40:09.611 --> 00:40:10.420
like,

1421
00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:12.370
like I guess the UFC is a big one.

1422
00:40:12.371 --> 00:40:13.240
That's a big target.

1423
00:40:13.590 --> 00:40:14.590
Hear about that all the time.

1424
00:40:14.590 --> 00:40:19.390
Like the anti violence aspect of it or anything else that people enjoy that is

1425
00:40:19.391 --> 00:40:20.081
very violent,

1426
00:40:20.081 --> 00:40:22.660
whether it's football or any other contact sport.

1427
00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:25.660
There's a lot of people that like really resist it and think that it's

1428
00:40:25.661 --> 00:40:27.130
detrimental to society.

1429
00:40:27.131 --> 00:40:28.540
And I think the contrary,

1430
00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:30.340
I think it's actually very good for it.

1431
00:40:30.610 --> 00:40:32.800
I worry more about when,

1432
00:40:32.801 --> 00:40:35.560
whenever you're trying to empower a group of people,

1433
00:40:35.590 --> 00:40:37.570
very vocally and verite with great energy.

1434
00:40:38.010 --> 00:40:38.710
Um,

1435
00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:41.020
sometimes what I worry about is,

1436
00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:42.640
and it happens all the time,

1437
00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:46.300
is you end up being somewhat tyrannical to another group of people.

1438
00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:46.800
Yeah.

1439
00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:47.170
Uh,

1440
00:40:47.170 --> 00:40:49.840
those people that might not understand what you're doing,

1441
00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:54.870
those people that have a religious reservations to what you're doing or all

1442
00:40:54.911 --> 00:40:58.240
whatever their reasons or just it doesn't sit right with them or they think it's

1443
00:40:58.241 --> 00:41:00.010
weird or they think it's unnatural.

1444
00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:04.240
I was talking to a 77 year old man about this Bruce Jenner thing,

1445
00:41:04.241 --> 00:41:05.470
and he's a good man.

1446
00:41:05.770 --> 00:41:06.281
And he goes,

1447
00:41:06.281 --> 00:41:07.210
it's unnatural.

1448
00:41:07.211 --> 00:41:08.560
We're celebrating the unnatural.

1449
00:41:08.610 --> 00:41:10.170
It's not a nurse.

1450
00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:10.871
I'm not saying it is,

1451
00:41:10.871 --> 00:41:11.351
I'm just saying,

1452
00:41:11.351 --> 00:41:13.510
but what I'm saying about it is it's,

1453
00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:15.010
it occurs enough,

1454
00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:15.580
right?

1455
00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:15.881
So that,

1456
00:41:15.881 --> 00:41:16.181
you know,

1457
00:41:16.181 --> 00:41:17.170
it's not unnatural.

1458
00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:18.033
It's just,

1459
00:41:18.170 --> 00:41:18.701
anyway,

1460
00:41:18.701 --> 00:41:19.870
I didn't get into it with them.

1461
00:41:19.871 --> 00:41:20.704
What I'm saying is that,

1462
00:41:21.030 --> 00:41:24.610
that everybody has their point of view and sometimes,

1463
00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:25.121
for example,

1464
00:41:25.121 --> 00:41:27.310
I think if you look at TV and stuff,

1465
00:41:27.311 --> 00:41:32.311
and I actually think we've become very intolerant of male behavior,

1466
00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:36.920
not the traditional prototypical masculine behaviors,

1467
00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:38.690
but sexual behavior as well.

1468
00:41:38.930 --> 00:41:43.670
So I think a lot of men are really afraid to sound even remotely.

1469
00:41:43.671 --> 00:41:47.750
Like they like having sex a lot with different women,

1470
00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:48.710
even if they're single,

1471
00:41:48.830 --> 00:41:50.000
cause there'll be called a creep,

1472
00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:51.560
let me call the scumbag.

1473
00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:53.540
We called all these things.

1474
00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:56.450
Would that used to be something that was actually celebrated?

1475
00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:57.800
And if you look at TV,

1476
00:41:57.801 --> 00:41:58.640
a lot of TV show,

1477
00:41:58.641 --> 00:41:59.900
especially mainstream TV,

1478
00:42:00.410 --> 00:42:03.170
if a guy's on that show and he has,

1479
00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:04.273
I don't know,

1480
00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:07.700
God forbid he's got a girlfriend and another girlfriend forget that that's

1481
00:42:07.701 --> 00:42:08.090
there.

1482
00:42:08.090 --> 00:42:11.750
But if he has five different women that he's sleeping with,

1483
00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:12.953
um,

1484
00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:14.060
you don't see that often.

1485
00:42:14.090 --> 00:42:16.850
You just don't see cause then we know a lot of guys you,

1486
00:42:17.090 --> 00:42:20.270
especially when we were younger who were that kind of masculine bent that put up

1487
00:42:20.271 --> 00:42:22.010
a lot of numbers you don't see,

1488
00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:26.300
I haven't seen too many of those characters on mainstream TV and if you do,

1489
00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:28.370
they are crucified.

1490
00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:29.750
They're just dirt bags.

1491
00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:31.130
And I think that's interesting.

1492
00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:32.930
I don't think that used to be the case as much.

1493
00:42:32.931 --> 00:42:33.970
I think that will go.

1494
00:42:33.971 --> 00:42:38.971
A lot of men are afraid to talk about sex the way women have for a long time.

1495
00:42:39.410 --> 00:42:40.470
I've noticed that the same thing.

1496
00:42:40.471 --> 00:42:42.860
It's like because women have been more marginalized,

1497
00:42:42.861 --> 00:42:45.380
their sexuality has been more of something.

1498
00:42:45.381 --> 00:42:46.760
Countries shamed there.

1499
00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:47.630
If they're sluts,

1500
00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:50.870
they're like Kim control from that sex and the city.

1501
00:42:50.871 --> 00:42:53.480
She was a very loose woman.

1502
00:42:53.660 --> 00:42:57.560
She was out there running around all willy nilly having sex with a bunch of

1503
00:42:57.561 --> 00:42:58.400
different gentlemen.

1504
00:42:58.550 --> 00:42:58.970
I mean,

1505
00:42:58.970 --> 00:43:00.050
but that was celebrated.

1506
00:43:00.051 --> 00:43:04.220
Like she was empowered because she was this cougar who's running around.

1507
00:43:04.310 --> 00:43:04.611
Yeah.

1508
00:43:04.611 --> 00:43:07.760
She's running around fucking all these guys and suck their dicks and bathrooms,

1509
00:43:07.761 --> 00:43:08.570
doing a bunch of dark,

1510
00:43:08.570 --> 00:43:10.010
dirty net naughty shit.

1511
00:43:10.250 --> 00:43:11.120
And it was great.

1512
00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:14.630
But if there was a show about a guy who did that with a bunch of women,

1513
00:43:14.631 --> 00:43:17.540
and then the thought less of the women after he was done with them,

1514
00:43:17.870 --> 00:43:18.351
you would go,

1515
00:43:18.351 --> 00:43:18.651
what?

1516
00:43:18.651 --> 00:43:19.650
A piece of shit.

1517
00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:21.140
And he wants to watch the show.

1518
00:43:21.530 --> 00:43:26.090
So what a woman could do by just getting done with guys fucking them and tossing

1519
00:43:26.091 --> 00:43:26.840
them aside,

1520
00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:27.830
no one cares.

1521
00:43:27.890 --> 00:43:30.380
There's virtually no backlash whatsoever.

1522
00:43:30.381 --> 00:43:31.214
But if a man,

1523
00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:31.760
yeah,

1524
00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:33.680
but if a man has the exact same behavior,

1525
00:43:33.890 --> 00:43:34.850
he's a piece of shit.

1526
00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:36.013
It's fascinating.

1527
00:43:36.650 --> 00:43:40.040
It is fascinating because with the woman were essentially watching like a

1528
00:43:40.041 --> 00:43:42.830
superhero or watching a woman who's turned the tables.

1529
00:43:42.831 --> 00:43:45.530
Now she's the Predator and the men of the prey.

1530
00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:46.011
Yeah,

1531
00:43:46.011 --> 00:43:47.030
you go curl,

1532
00:43:47.330 --> 00:43:51.410
you get 'em and after they'd done throw fucking throw their phone away,

1533
00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:52.220
delete,

1534
00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:54.920
delete all of their text messages from your phone,

1535
00:43:54.921 --> 00:43:56.960
delete their number and never call him again.

1536
00:43:56.961 --> 00:43:57.860
Fuck him.

1537
00:43:58.250 --> 00:43:58.941
Move on,

1538
00:43:58.941 --> 00:43:59.774
girl.

1539
00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:01.310
She becomes this.

1540
00:44:01.490 --> 00:44:02.031
But if you know,

1541
00:44:02.031 --> 00:44:03.230
if a woman did that to a man,

1542
00:44:03.231 --> 00:44:03.561
he'd be like,

1543
00:44:03.561 --> 00:44:04.490
oh wow.

1544
00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:05.630
Or amended that to a woman.

1545
00:44:05.631 --> 00:44:05.901
He'd be like,

1546
00:44:05.901 --> 00:44:06.171
God,

1547
00:44:06.171 --> 00:44:07.340
what a Dick that guy is.

1548
00:44:07.610 --> 00:44:08.420
But again,

1549
00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:09.410
that's artificial.

1550
00:44:09.490 --> 00:44:09.840
That's,

1551
00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:10.850
that's not natural.

1552
00:44:10.870 --> 00:44:12.110
That's kind of a lie too.

1553
00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:14.190
That's kind of where there's girls out there like that.

1554
00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:15.570
I'm saying that when,

1555
00:44:15.571 --> 00:44:15.800
when,

1556
00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:16.070
when,

1557
00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:16.311
when,

1558
00:44:16.311 --> 00:44:16.941
that's when,

1559
00:44:16.941 --> 00:44:18.660
that's kind of like when it's at,

1560
00:44:18.661 --> 00:44:19.610
it's a suggested.

1561
00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:22.160
That's how women really are all of all women.

1562
00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:22.630
You got,

1563
00:44:22.630 --> 00:44:22.881
well,

1564
00:44:22.881 --> 00:44:23.181
what we,

1565
00:44:23.181 --> 00:44:25.460
we're a lot more complicated than that and not really,

1566
00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:25.971
well,

1567
00:44:25.971 --> 00:44:30.320
I think if I had a friend that got done over by a girl at Kim control and she

1568
00:44:30.321 --> 00:44:31.140
never called back,

1569
00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:32.010
I would laugh

1570
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:32.940
<v 1>my dick off.</v>

1571
00:44:32.941 --> 00:44:34.050
I would think it would be so funny.

1572
00:44:34.051 --> 00:44:35.640
I would talk to him about it every day.

1573
00:44:35.850 --> 00:44:36.241
I'd be like,

1574
00:44:36.241 --> 00:44:37.350
so she never called you again.

1575
00:44:37.610 --> 00:44:38.290
I'm going to college.

1576
00:44:38.290 --> 00:44:42.180
She just dumped you like it would be funny to guys guys done to me.

1577
00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:43.340
I had it done to myself,

1578
00:44:43.410 --> 00:44:44.640
said to me maybe three times,

1579
00:44:44.641 --> 00:44:47.140
one by a pretty famous a woman and I I,

1580
00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:47.551
yeah.

1581
00:44:47.551 --> 00:44:48.384
And I was like,

1582
00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:49.231
I was like,

1583
00:44:49.231 --> 00:44:50.460
excuse me.

1584
00:44:50.620 --> 00:44:51.001
I was like,

1585
00:44:51.001 --> 00:44:52.560
how dare you,

1586
00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:54.540
you don't want more of this.

1587
00:44:54.541 --> 00:44:55.550
It's hard of you man.

1588
00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:56.730
You're tired of your bullshit.

1589
00:44:56.970 --> 00:44:57.810
That's normal too.

1590
00:44:57.900 --> 00:45:02.900
Or they just got tired of me in general in bed to get back to that Bruce Jenner

1591
00:45:02.941 --> 00:45:03.540
thing,

1592
00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:05.670
the Caitlyn whatever he's going to call himself,

1593
00:45:05.671 --> 00:45:06.090
call me,

1594
00:45:06.090 --> 00:45:06.923
call her.

1595
00:45:07.420 --> 00:45:08.010
She's,

1596
00:45:08.010 --> 00:45:10.350
I don't even know how much is true and how much is not true.

1597
00:45:10.350 --> 00:45:13.350
Cause I was listening to this radio show and they were talking about how he

1598
00:45:13.351 --> 00:45:16.320
underwent a 12 hour surgery to change his face more feminized it.

1599
00:45:16.650 --> 00:45:18.960
I do not know if that is the truth or not,

1600
00:45:19.770 --> 00:45:21.630
but who cares?

1601
00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:22.710
That's my take on it.

1602
00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:23.730
My take on it is,

1603
00:45:23.731 --> 00:45:24.660
I think it's cute.

1604
00:45:25.330 --> 00:45:27.810
I think we don't let him do whatever he wants to do.

1605
00:45:27.870 --> 00:45:29.490
I mean he's not interesting to me.

1606
00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:29.681
Well,

1607
00:45:29.681 --> 00:45:30.810
what if he ran interesting too,

1608
00:45:30.811 --> 00:45:31.770
isn't he getting the,

1609
00:45:31.970 --> 00:45:32.760
is he worthy?

1610
00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:36.060
Arthur Ashe award at the espys for courage.

1611
00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:37.410
Okay,

1612
00:45:37.410 --> 00:45:38.400
well it's kind of courageous,

1613
00:45:38.401 --> 00:45:42.630
but it's not like it's not a person that's been seeking attention by any means

1614
00:45:42.631 --> 00:45:44.070
necessary for a long time.

1615
00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:47.300
It's not like we're now talking about a guy was on a reality show for a long

1616
00:45:47.310 --> 00:45:49.290
time and now this is a reality show.

1617
00:45:49.291 --> 00:45:49.951
It's also,

1618
00:45:49.951 --> 00:45:54.951
it's like we're not being honest about the gentleman in question because the

1619
00:45:55.501 --> 00:45:56.330
woman in question.

1620
00:45:56.330 --> 00:46:00.450
So that's what I felt when I saw him on the cover of Vanity Fair with that

1621
00:46:00.451 --> 00:46:01.290
airbrushed and everything.

1622
00:46:01.291 --> 00:46:02.124
I went,

1623
00:46:02.370 --> 00:46:02.940
well,

1624
00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:04.530
more power to you if you want to do that.

1625
00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:06.810
But that feels a little bit like spectacle.

1626
00:46:07.270 --> 00:46:07.740
I mean,

1627
00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:08.640
what does he do?

1628
00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:12.780
He just lives this nonsense life on television.

1629
00:46:13.050 --> 00:46:13.801
I mean this is,

1630
00:46:13.801 --> 00:46:15.300
this is a guy that we're celebrating,

1631
00:46:15.330 --> 00:46:15.650
right?

1632
00:46:15.650 --> 00:46:18.750
Like the only thing that's interesting is that he doesn't want to be a man

1633
00:46:18.751 --> 00:46:19.230
anymore.

1634
00:46:19.230 --> 00:46:20.670
That's the interesting aspect of him.

1635
00:46:20.671 --> 00:46:21.000
That's right.

1636
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:22.740
Everything outside of that is not interesting.

1637
00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:23.130
I agree.

1638
00:46:23.130 --> 00:46:25.680
He lives this really bizarre life.

1639
00:46:25.681 --> 00:46:28.080
I just can't imagine anybody who didn't need it,

1640
00:46:28.290 --> 00:46:29.880
want to live like that.

1641
00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:34.440
We have a microscope up your ass on this weird show and you're,

1642
00:46:34.441 --> 00:46:34.741
you're,

1643
00:46:34.741 --> 00:46:38.550
you're living out these false scenarios that are planned by producers.

1644
00:46:38.551 --> 00:46:42.660
So today we went to try to figure out what's wrong with the washing machine.

1645
00:46:42.690 --> 00:46:43.740
The fuck you did.

1646
00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:44.431
You know,

1647
00:46:44.431 --> 00:46:45.570
this is all nonsense.

1648
00:46:45.571 --> 00:46:45.781
You know,

1649
00:46:45.781 --> 00:46:46.614
it's nonsense.

1650
00:46:46.770 --> 00:46:51.180
So this guy has been on this nonsense show for x amount of years,

1651
00:46:51.330 --> 00:46:52.580
just it's,

1652
00:46:52.660 --> 00:46:56.610
it's really bizarre way to like put yourself out there,

1653
00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:57.360
right?

1654
00:46:57.360 --> 00:47:01.080
And then he decides that he's a woman and that becomes the most interesting

1655
00:47:01.081 --> 00:47:02.220
aspect of him.

1656
00:47:02.430 --> 00:47:02.850
Right.

1657
00:47:02.850 --> 00:47:06.540
Way More interesting than anything that he had ever done before other than win

1658
00:47:06.541 --> 00:47:07.980
the gold medal in the decathlon.

1659
00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:09.360
And he was a great athlete,

1660
00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:11.010
but like nobody cared.

1661
00:47:11.290 --> 00:47:13.200
Like everybody wanted to pay attention to his daughter.

1662
00:47:13.350 --> 00:47:15.060
Everybody wanted to pay attention to the mom.

1663
00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:16.300
And Bruce Jenner was like,

1664
00:47:16.410 --> 00:47:17.460
like this poor,

1665
00:47:17.461 --> 00:47:21.150
sad character that was hanging around the show that I was just thinking was

1666
00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:22.013
emasculated.

1667
00:47:22.380 --> 00:47:22.771
You know,

1668
00:47:22.771 --> 00:47:26.060
like he's in my love that the new Ben did.

1669
00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:26.610
Oh,

1670
00:47:26.610 --> 00:47:27.720
don't tell anybody I won't.

1671
00:47:27.721 --> 00:47:29.680
But he did her pet and he opened.

1672
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:30.431
<v 0>By the way,</v>

1673
00:47:30.431 --> 00:47:31.540
thanks for opening for me.

1674
00:47:31.610 --> 00:47:35.920
My boy Joe Rogan drives all the way down on no sleep and open both shows for me.

1675
00:47:36.130 --> 00:47:36.963
Talk about a friend.

1676
00:47:37.450 --> 00:47:38.283
Meanwhile,

1677
00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:39.940
that bit I got,

1678
00:47:39.970 --> 00:47:40.900
I was watching,

1679
00:47:40.901 --> 00:47:43.540
I had to go on to an hour after you and I was like,

1680
00:47:43.630 --> 00:47:45.340
that is a hell of a bit.

1681
00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:46.300
Oh thanks man.

1682
00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:46.900
Dude,

1683
00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:47.733
it's better today

1684
00:47:49.230 --> 00:47:50.110
because it's so new.

1685
00:47:50.111 --> 00:47:50.860
And I thought I went,

1686
00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:52.600
I wonder what this is going to really turn into.

1687
00:47:53.590 --> 00:47:54.420
Good.

1688
00:47:54.420 --> 00:47:56.410
I enjoy doing it because it's got so much going on.

1689
00:47:56.411 --> 00:47:57.211
Took me out of my shell,

1690
00:47:57.211 --> 00:47:58.044
but helped me too.

1691
00:47:58.750 --> 00:47:59.830
I'd rather watch this right now.

1692
00:48:00.970 --> 00:48:03.520
That was a fun of taping her show is excellent.

1693
00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:04.733
Well Fun.

1694
00:48:04.810 --> 00:48:05.410
Really Fun.

1695
00:48:05.410 --> 00:48:06.670
Thanks everybody for coming down.

1696
00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:07.593
I'm was so cool.

1697
00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:09.250
Um,

1698
00:48:09.250 --> 00:48:11.110
so back to the Bruce Jenner thing.

1699
00:48:11.170 --> 00:48:14.470
I think if it encourages more people to do that,

1700
00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:16.030
if that's the real calling,

1701
00:48:16.690 --> 00:48:17.500
great,

1702
00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:17.860
great.

1703
00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:21.070
I know people that have changed genders and they're very happy.

1704
00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:23.110
That's totally possible.

1705
00:48:23.170 --> 00:48:24.170
It's totally possible.

1706
00:48:24.190 --> 00:48:24.311
Did.

1707
00:48:24.311 --> 00:48:28.090
The biggest thing too is that apparently the suicide rate for kids who feel this

1708
00:48:28.091 --> 00:48:29.290
way is very high.

1709
00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:30.940
Like according to Chris and Beck,

1710
00:48:31.090 --> 00:48:31.490
it was,

1711
00:48:31.490 --> 00:48:32.960
it's 45% of something crazy.

1712
00:48:34.170 --> 00:48:36.460
So it's just hard.

1713
00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:39.760
It's hard to be a normal person,

1714
00:48:39.970 --> 00:48:40.990
a hard to be a person,

1715
00:48:40.991 --> 00:48:45.991
like a normal white male in America who's not poor.

1716
00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:49.520
So normal like middle of the rope or it's very difficult for,

1717
00:48:49.580 --> 00:48:52.450
so imagine being marginalized.

1718
00:48:52.930 --> 00:48:53.201
I mean,

1719
00:48:53.201 --> 00:48:53.981
imagine,

1720
00:48:53.981 --> 00:48:56.020
just imagine where we're already,

1721
00:48:56.021 --> 00:48:59.170
there are just a group of people you've never met who hates your guts and

1722
00:48:59.171 --> 00:49:01.360
actually some who would actually kill you will.

1723
00:49:01.361 --> 00:49:01.810
You can,

1724
00:49:01.810 --> 00:49:03.220
you can feel that if you want.

1725
00:49:03.250 --> 00:49:06.400
There's certain neighborhoods where you can go in there as a white man and

1726
00:49:06.401 --> 00:49:07.570
you'll be a victim.

1727
00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:09.160
You'll be like an instant victim.

1728
00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:10.060
They'll target you.

1729
00:49:10.450 --> 00:49:10.931
I mean there's,

1730
00:49:10.931 --> 00:49:13.450
there's parts of the world where that's absolutely true.

1731
00:49:13.451 --> 00:49:14.560
There's parts of America,

1732
00:49:14.561 --> 00:49:15.910
I'm sure that's absolutely true,

1733
00:49:15.911 --> 00:49:18.880
but overwhelmingly you got an easy as fuck,

1734
00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:19.910
easy as fuck.

1735
00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:21.580
So when you have it easy as fuck,

1736
00:49:21.581 --> 00:49:23.590
sometimes I think it's easy to take for granted.

1737
00:49:23.591 --> 00:49:24.251
Someone who doesn't,

1738
00:49:24.251 --> 00:49:27.520
not necessarily saying that Bruce Jenner didn't have it easy because you know,

1739
00:49:27.521 --> 00:49:28.331
you watch him on that show,

1740
00:49:28.331 --> 00:49:29.170
he's not struggling.

1741
00:49:29.171 --> 00:49:30.340
It's just weird,

1742
00:49:30.910 --> 00:49:31.241
you know?

1743
00:49:31.241 --> 00:49:33.580
But there's people in,

1744
00:49:33.581 --> 00:49:38.581
in this world that are going through all sorts of pain for no fault of their

1745
00:49:38.771 --> 00:49:39.370
own.

1746
00:49:39.370 --> 00:49:41.710
They're just born in a shitty household.

1747
00:49:42.010 --> 00:49:44.770
They just born with the wrong human beings,

1748
00:49:44.771 --> 00:49:47.980
guarding over them and raising them and communicating with them and they're

1749
00:49:47.981 --> 00:49:49.000
fucked from birth.

1750
00:49:49.270 --> 00:49:50.950
And that's something that nobody wants to admit.

1751
00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:51.791
Well,

1752
00:49:51.791 --> 00:49:51.971
that,

1753
00:49:51.971 --> 00:49:56.971
that's also kind of always how I've looked at things where I was born on third

1754
00:49:57.101 --> 00:49:58.300
base and told her on home,

1755
00:49:58.600 --> 00:49:59.433
you know,

1756
00:49:59.590 --> 00:50:03.660
I'm a white American male in 2015 it gets some pain and good looking.

1757
00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:08.410
I got a ridiculous line shredded and I get paid to make people laugh.

1758
00:50:08.470 --> 00:50:08.771
I mean,

1759
00:50:08.771 --> 00:50:10.480
I get paid to make people laugh and I'm healthy.

1760
00:50:10.780 --> 00:50:11.531
Well you also,

1761
00:50:11.531 --> 00:50:13.570
you what's attractive about,

1762
00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:13.960
um,

1763
00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:17.770
people that have a situation like that is that you're appreciating it.

1764
00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:18.130
Ah,

1765
00:50:18.130 --> 00:50:18.431
you know,

1766
00:50:18.431 --> 00:50:23.431
when we talked to comics that whine about how many shows they have to do or that

1767
00:50:23.531 --> 00:50:25.930
they can't get the sit-com made or they can't,

1768
00:50:26.260 --> 00:50:26.561
you know,

1769
00:50:26.561 --> 00:50:26.801
man,

1770
00:50:26.801 --> 00:50:27.680
it's business.

1771
00:50:27.681 --> 00:50:27.831
You know,

1772
00:50:27.831 --> 00:50:28.100
I'm just

1773
00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:29.300
<v 1>talking fucking agents,</v>

1774
00:50:29.301 --> 00:50:29.481
you know,

1775
00:50:29.481 --> 00:50:31.940
have those conversations with people make you're exhausted,

1776
00:50:31.970 --> 00:50:33.320
lack of perspective,

1777
00:50:33.350 --> 00:50:34.160
you're exhausting.

1778
00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:36.080
Pick up a history book or a newspaper.

1779
00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:37.131
The also,

1780
00:50:37.131 --> 00:50:39.620
I think people are in this weird position,

1781
00:50:39.650 --> 00:50:43.670
actors are perpetually in this position and comics are in this position to a

1782
00:50:43.671 --> 00:50:46.460
certain extent because they want to have sitcoms and things along those lines.

1783
00:50:46.970 --> 00:50:48.860
You have to be chosen,

1784
00:50:49.310 --> 00:50:50.390
you have to be chosen.

1785
00:50:50.750 --> 00:50:51.021
You know,

1786
00:50:51.021 --> 00:50:52.160
you have to be chosen.

1787
00:50:52.161 --> 00:50:53.060
Someone has to say,

1788
00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:54.380
I'm going to hire Brian,

1789
00:50:54.381 --> 00:50:57.140
count for my show and you're going to make him a star.

1790
00:50:57.410 --> 00:51:02.410
Whereas what's going on now for the first time ever is people are doing podcasts

1791
00:51:03.111 --> 00:51:05.000
that are turning them into famous people.

1792
00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:08.510
The you guys are famous from that fucking podcast,

1793
00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:10.970
the fighter and the kid is a giant podcast.

1794
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:11.420
Yeah.

1795
00:51:11.420 --> 00:51:15.080
I mean you were already famous before that and Shabazz already famous for the

1796
00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:15.350
USA,

1797
00:51:15.350 --> 00:51:17.540
but there is a coalescence,

1798
00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:22.870
there's this crazy energy behind you guys and that show that I see all the time

1799
00:51:23.270 --> 00:51:25.970
that when I was opening for you on your show,

1800
00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:28.010
when you were filming your comedy special,

1801
00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:31.640
the audience was filled with those fighter and the kid shirts crazy.

1802
00:51:31.730 --> 00:51:32.181
I saw,

1803
00:51:32.181 --> 00:51:34.310
I don't know how many I saw and I saw all the different models,

1804
00:51:34.311 --> 00:51:34.630
the how,

1805
00:51:34.630 --> 00:51:35.463
the different ones you have.

1806
00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:41.320
And so I think what would a guy like you gets to do that?

1807
00:51:42.771 --> 00:51:44.030
A lot of guys don't,

1808
00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:47.240
don't have that opportunity is you get to just be yourself.

1809
00:51:47.660 --> 00:51:48.480
You get to be yourselves,

1810
00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:49.100
right?

1811
00:51:49.100 --> 00:51:52.340
And you don't have to worry about the decisions of these other people that are

1812
00:51:52.341 --> 00:51:55.010
trying to cast you are pro no deals to be.

1813
00:51:55.011 --> 00:51:57.800
That's where all the frustration seems to come from those guys.

1814
00:51:57.801 --> 00:52:02.360
It's all about dealing with other people and that's what acting is all the time.

1815
00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:04.610
What acting is all the times getting chosen.

1816
00:52:05.090 --> 00:52:05.520
When you,

1817
00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:06.360
when you can become,

1818
00:52:06.361 --> 00:52:08.070
come on somebody else's words,

1819
00:52:08.300 --> 00:52:08.910
words,

1820
00:52:08.910 --> 00:52:10.940
somebody else's clothes and somebody else's story.

1821
00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:15.380
If you could become autonomous and you can get away from anybody else's opinions

1822
00:52:15.381 --> 00:52:16.880
and ideas that you have to,

1823
00:52:17.180 --> 00:52:18.470
they have to throw them into the soup,

1824
00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:20.750
then you're truly responsible for your own work.

1825
00:52:21.190 --> 00:52:24.170
And when you're truly responsible for whatever the fuck you're actually doing,

1826
00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:27.140
then you have a totally different kinds of connection to it.

1827
00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:27.771
So like he,

1828
00:52:27.771 --> 00:52:28.610
these guys had like,

1829
00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:30.890
they get angry about the business,

1830
00:52:30.891 --> 00:52:33.710
about the way the business is changing in a weird way.

1831
00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:34.401
Like you,

1832
00:52:34.401 --> 00:52:35.031
you really,

1833
00:52:35.031 --> 00:52:36.380
if you enjoy being a comic,

1834
00:52:36.381 --> 00:52:38.150
you really don't have to do anything else anymore.

1835
00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:41.130
I got all that in the back of the day.

1836
00:52:41.131 --> 00:52:41.781
It was just like,

1837
00:52:41.781 --> 00:52:42.081
boy,

1838
00:52:42.081 --> 00:52:45.700
I hope I can keep this comedy thing afloat until I get that Sitcom that every

1839
00:52:45.701 --> 00:52:46.790
want to get that Sitcom.

1840
00:52:46.910 --> 00:52:47.540
I remember that.

1841
00:52:47.540 --> 00:52:47.871
Yeah.

1842
00:52:47.871 --> 00:52:48.920
That's all anybody wanted.

1843
00:52:48.950 --> 00:52:50.850
I know it was the analog is the holy grail.

1844
00:52:50.910 --> 00:52:53.150
We would get mad when actors would fake it.

1845
00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:53.661
You know,

1846
00:52:53.661 --> 00:52:56.870
actress who put together some bullshit fucking generic act.

1847
00:52:56.930 --> 00:52:57.260
Yeah.

1848
00:52:57.260 --> 00:53:01.370
And you knew that all they had was this seven minutes they were faking to try to

1849
00:53:01.371 --> 00:53:03.410
get on a sitcom and everybody will like,

1850
00:53:03.411 --> 00:53:03.591
yeah,

1851
00:53:03.591 --> 00:53:04.281
he's an actor.

1852
00:53:04.281 --> 00:53:06.680
He's just an actor as an actor faking it.

1853
00:53:06.890 --> 00:53:07.880
Like we had this weird,

1854
00:53:07.881 --> 00:53:08.100
this,

1855
00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:09.700
these weird distinctions yet,

1856
00:53:09.830 --> 00:53:13.040
but the guys up there doing standup with some standup that he wrote,

1857
00:53:13.041 --> 00:53:13.760
but nope,

1858
00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:14.030
nope.

1859
00:53:14.030 --> 00:53:15.910
He's faking as fake and it's for acne.

1860
00:53:15.911 --> 00:53:18.170
It's just for acting and at the end result.

1861
00:53:18.460 --> 00:53:19.310
But you would get,

1862
00:53:19.340 --> 00:53:19.701
you know,

1863
00:53:19.701 --> 00:53:23.840
these people that would go up there and do that and you really could see that

1864
00:53:23.841 --> 00:53:25.620
they were like Tom Hanks and punchline.

1865
00:53:27.490 --> 00:53:28.080
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1866
00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:30.160
Like acting like a stand up.

1867
00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:31.051
But then it's like,

1868
00:53:31.051 --> 00:53:33.540
well who the fuck should you be able to make?

1869
00:53:33.660 --> 00:53:35.130
Who are you to make that distinction?

1870
00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:35.850
Yeah.

1871
00:53:35.850 --> 00:53:36.091
You know,

1872
00:53:36.091 --> 00:53:37.820
why should you be able to make funny?

1873
00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:38.610
It's funny,

1874
00:53:38.610 --> 00:53:39.300
right?

1875
00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:39.730
So why,

1876
00:53:39.730 --> 00:53:42.060
how can you decide that he's not a real stand up?

1877
00:53:42.061 --> 00:53:45.300
Because he wanted to put together seven minutes.

1878
00:53:45.301 --> 00:53:46.710
He used to always tell me to stand up.

1879
00:53:46.711 --> 00:53:48.300
I worked so hard and acting.

1880
00:53:48.420 --> 00:53:52.320
I remember how hard like I'd be in class and I just worked at it and I would do

1881
00:53:52.321 --> 00:53:54.760
scenes and I would cry and I,

1882
00:53:55.310 --> 00:53:56.143
and then I just,

1883
00:53:56.220 --> 00:53:57.031
I don't know man.

1884
00:53:57.031 --> 00:53:57.990
It's what happened is I was just,

1885
00:53:57.991 --> 00:54:02.160
when I got a taste of real standup and then with the podcast and then I was

1886
00:54:02.161 --> 00:54:02.371
like,

1887
00:54:02.371 --> 00:54:02.940
man,

1888
00:54:02.940 --> 00:54:07.940
I got to go where I got to drive where and sit on a set for how long we'll do

1889
00:54:08.070 --> 00:54:09.240
five minutes of acting.

1890
00:54:09.630 --> 00:54:12.090
It's if people saw how movies are made,

1891
00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:15.360
I think they'd have a lot less referenced for the entire,

1892
00:54:15.810 --> 00:54:18.510
if prawsaud how coal was pulled out of the ground,

1893
00:54:18.570 --> 00:54:19.920
I think they'd appreciate it more.

1894
00:54:20.010 --> 00:54:20.810
I agree.

1895
00:54:20.810 --> 00:54:22.740
And then just go in to buy it and that's right.

1896
00:54:22.770 --> 00:54:25.140
A coal coal would be on the cover of people magazine.

1897
00:54:25.170 --> 00:54:25.620
Yeah.

1898
00:54:25.620 --> 00:54:27.390
It's just I don't enjoy the process.

1899
00:54:27.420 --> 00:54:30.990
I don't enjoy the process and I don't enjoy some of the actors.

1900
00:54:30.991 --> 00:54:32.250
I met a lot of actors or cools,

1901
00:54:32.251 --> 00:54:33.030
fuck,

1902
00:54:33.030 --> 00:54:35.550
but there's a lot of them that are a lot of fucking work,

1903
00:54:35.580 --> 00:54:39.150
like a brutal amount of work or communicating with them.

1904
00:54:39.151 --> 00:54:42.720
It's very frustrating and they're stressed out all the time.

1905
00:54:42.750 --> 00:54:46.560
They're there in this this thing where they're always trying to get approved.

1906
00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:48.150
They're always trying to get cast there,

1907
00:54:48.151 --> 00:54:50.790
was trying to get you and you've got to create a network that way.

1908
00:54:50.791 --> 00:54:51.624
You have to,

1909
00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:51.950
you know,

1910
00:54:51.950 --> 00:54:55.860
you're selling yourself and it's not easy and you're selling yourself as being

1911
00:54:55.861 --> 00:54:57.300
exactly like everybody else.

1912
00:54:58.310 --> 00:55:01.540
I mean there's like a hum that they all have.

1913
00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:03.360
They all the same frequency.

1914
00:55:03.361 --> 00:55:04.194
Hum.

1915
00:55:05.970 --> 00:55:07.380
They try to stay on that frequency.

1916
00:55:07.381 --> 00:55:09.240
They don't vary because they want those jobs.

1917
00:55:09.540 --> 00:55:10.410
They want to be,

1918
00:55:10.411 --> 00:55:10.981
they want to be,

1919
00:55:10.981 --> 00:55:12.990
they can have their own political opinions.

1920
00:55:12.991 --> 00:55:17.160
A lot of the times it just absorb this left wing ideology that seems to be

1921
00:55:17.161 --> 00:55:18.360
floating around Hollywood.

1922
00:55:18.390 --> 00:55:19.090
Yup.

1923
00:55:19.090 --> 00:55:19.850
Yup.

1924
00:55:19.850 --> 00:55:21.660
I know it's a weird place,

1925
00:55:21.670 --> 00:55:23.280
but it's a weird place,

1926
00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:26.070
but I think it's fucking changing in a big way.

1927
00:55:26.071 --> 00:55:26.904
Man.

1928
00:55:27.050 --> 00:55:27.883
Ned,

1929
00:55:28.370 --> 00:55:29.520
I think everything's changing.

1930
00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:31.080
I think we're going to look back.

1931
00:55:31.470 --> 00:55:33.750
I think we're in the middle of the storm and uh,

1932
00:55:33.751 --> 00:55:38.600
I don't think we quite realize how significant some of the changes in culture.

1933
00:55:38.601 --> 00:55:39.301
I said it when,

1934
00:55:39.301 --> 00:55:41.640
when people are in an epoch,

1935
00:55:41.670 --> 00:55:43.350
when they're in an unchanging moment,

1936
00:55:43.351 --> 00:55:47.310
like the people who were coming into the renaissance didn't know they were in

1937
00:55:47.311 --> 00:55:48.210
the renaissance,

1938
00:55:48.211 --> 00:55:49.860
didn't call it the renaissance,

1939
00:55:50.040 --> 00:55:52.320
didn't know that there was something called the renaissance at that they were

1940
00:55:52.321 --> 00:55:53.880
even in the dark ages before that.

1941
00:55:54.270 --> 00:55:57.810
So there are countless examples of that where this is the most important date.

1942
00:55:57.811 --> 00:56:00.600
They weren't aware of that and they weren't aware of the bronze age then the,

1943
00:56:00.850 --> 00:56:02.040
the mental age and all that.

1944
00:56:02.750 --> 00:56:07.750
So you're living your life and those kinds of forces and trends and movements

1945
00:56:08.940 --> 00:56:10.110
are more subtle than that.

1946
00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:10.621
Yeah.

1947
00:56:10.621 --> 00:56:15.621
I think this one though is so crazy that it reveals a lot about the nature of

1948
00:56:17.371 --> 00:56:18.300
recognition.

1949
00:56:18.930 --> 00:56:23.070
Meaning like recognizing when things are weird because I don't think we're

1950
00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:24.310
recognizing it nearly

1951
00:56:24.310 --> 00:56:25.660
<v 1>as much as it deserves.</v>

1952
00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:26.500
What do you mean like,

1953
00:56:26.500 --> 00:56:26.681
well,

1954
00:56:26.681 --> 00:56:27.830
I think that you get used,

1955
00:56:27.970 --> 00:56:29.320
people get used to things.

1956
00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:30.520
It's like if you go like,

1957
00:56:30.590 --> 00:56:30.970
um,

1958
00:56:30.970 --> 00:56:31.840
Justin wren,

1959
00:56:32.110 --> 00:56:32.950
the UFC fighter,

1960
00:56:32.951 --> 00:56:34.540
it's been on this podcast a bunch of times,

1961
00:56:34.541 --> 00:56:38.770
he does the fight for forgotten a foundation that he created to go and build

1962
00:56:38.771 --> 00:56:39.171
wells.

1963
00:56:39.171 --> 00:56:40.004
So the pygmies,

1964
00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:40.450
you know,

1965
00:56:40.450 --> 00:56:42.460
he goes down there and build these pygmies as well.

1966
00:56:42.461 --> 00:56:43.390
It's just a great guy.

1967
00:56:43.540 --> 00:56:45.190
But those folks who live there,

1968
00:56:45.220 --> 00:56:47.500
that is their life and that is what they're used to.

1969
00:56:47.710 --> 00:56:51.610
Just like when we were on that Prince Edward Prince of Wales Island,

1970
00:56:52.140 --> 00:56:52.420
we,

1971
00:56:52.420 --> 00:56:54.190
that was our life for those five days.

1972
00:56:54.220 --> 00:56:54.480
Yeah.

1973
00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:56.740
That's one of the reasons why when I came back here,

1974
00:56:56.741 --> 00:57:00.130
it felt so good to realize that this is,

1975
00:57:00.131 --> 00:57:02.860
this feeling of signing your face is very pleasurable.

1976
00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:05.500
This feeling of being around people and having,

1977
00:57:05.530 --> 00:57:05.950
you know,

1978
00:57:05.950 --> 00:57:09.460
the convenience of grocery stores and restaurants that are good and,

1979
00:57:09.530 --> 00:57:11.050
and comedy clubs and the,

1980
00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:11.491
all the,

1981
00:57:11.491 --> 00:57:13.420
the good aspects that the city provides.

1982
00:57:13.870 --> 00:57:18.870
It made me like acutely aware of that because being in that environment that

1983
00:57:19.151 --> 00:57:20.740
could be like you,

1984
00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:21.940
you adapt to that.

1985
00:57:21.970 --> 00:57:24.220
People are super adaptation,

1986
00:57:24.550 --> 00:57:25.270
adaptation,

1987
00:57:25.270 --> 00:57:26.103
adaptive.

1988
00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:27.033
What does that look wrong?

1989
00:57:27.220 --> 00:57:29.800
Adoptation agitative no,

1990
00:57:30.190 --> 00:57:31.540
it is adaptive rafting,

1991
00:57:32.290 --> 00:57:33.430
but people are really,

1992
00:57:33.431 --> 00:57:34.330
really adaptive.

1993
00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:36.970
We can change and we can morph and we can,

1994
00:57:37.450 --> 00:57:42.450
and I think in some ways we're not aware of when it's happening.

1995
00:57:42.970 --> 00:57:47.290
It just becomes a normal life like text messages and photos and being able to

1996
00:57:47.291 --> 00:57:49.000
Google things becomes normal,

1997
00:57:49.150 --> 00:57:50.740
but I think historians,

1998
00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:56.280
when they look back on the era between 1994 and 2015 they will say a tornado of

1999
00:58:00.461 --> 00:58:01.360
information.

2000
00:58:01.540 --> 00:58:05.950
They will see an unprecedented amount of data that's being passed back and forth

2001
00:58:06.130 --> 00:58:07.510
to the point where at the end,

2002
00:58:07.630 --> 00:58:12.630
at the very end of the line with 2015 more data gets done in like an hour,

2003
00:58:14.530 --> 00:58:18.010
then more data gets passed by in 24 hours.

2004
00:58:18.130 --> 00:58:20.890
Then the entire history of the human race.

2005
00:58:20.891 --> 00:58:21.610
Yeah,

2006
00:58:21.610 --> 00:58:23.080
just stop and think about that.

2007
00:58:23.110 --> 00:58:23.830
It's incredible.

2008
00:58:23.830 --> 00:58:25.780
The entire history of the human race.

2009
00:58:25.900 --> 00:58:29.170
That's how much data we produce every day.

2010
00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:33.520
That mean when you all have the clients talking about the movement of

2011
00:58:33.521 --> 00:58:34.061
information,

2012
00:58:34.061 --> 00:58:35.230
I mean a lot of it's not an office,

2013
00:58:35.640 --> 00:58:35.981
by the way.

2014
00:58:35.981 --> 00:58:36.310
I don't know.

2015
00:58:36.310 --> 00:58:37.930
Those numbers are exactly correct.

2016
00:58:38.020 --> 00:58:39.460
It might be like two days or one day,

2017
00:58:39.461 --> 00:58:40.390
whatever the fuck it is.

2018
00:58:40.570 --> 00:58:45.570
It's some insanely small amount of time that represents the entire history of

2019
00:58:45.941 --> 00:58:47.680
human beings writing things down.

2020
00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:49.210
Most of his bullshit,

2021
00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:52.810
most of his Facebook messages and text messages and tweets.

2022
00:58:53.110 --> 00:58:56.350
But the bottom line is it's exchanges.

2023
00:58:56.410 --> 00:58:56.771
Okay.

2024
00:58:56.771 --> 00:59:00.340
It might be nonsensical social exchanges that don't mean anything.

2025
00:59:00.341 --> 00:59:01.860
Lol Tea.

2026
00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:03.010
It might be bullshit,

2027
00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:07.150
it might be Instagram pictures of your ass and yoga pants and might be nonsense.

2028
00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:09.610
But in that nonsense,

2029
00:59:09.611 --> 00:59:14.611
there's an unprecedented amount of tweets that are leading people to check out

2030
00:59:14.951 --> 00:59:19.600
articles that are leading people to maybe reform opinions or reconsider

2031
00:59:19.870 --> 00:59:21.400
preconceived notions.

2032
00:59:21.560 --> 00:59:22.010
And then you'll

2033
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:23.060
<v 0>start reading comments,</v>

2034
00:59:23.061 --> 00:59:27.260
how other people agree or disagree and you start communicating with each other.

2035
00:59:27.261 --> 00:59:31.700
And the unprecedented sort of exchanges taking place,

2036
00:59:31.910 --> 00:59:35.180
I just don't think we know is to also bring,

2037
00:59:35.181 --> 00:59:36.590
it just happened while we were alive.

2038
00:59:36.620 --> 00:59:39.200
It's also humanizing a lot of those experiences.

2039
00:59:39.410 --> 00:59:39.621
So,

2040
00:59:39.621 --> 00:59:39.800
so,

2041
00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:42.140
so I think a lot when you frame like for example,

2042
00:59:42.141 --> 00:59:43.010
this Bruce Jenner thing,

2043
00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:44.880
when you frame it like an uh,

2044
00:59:44.881 --> 00:59:46.910
people really do understand that when you finally somebody says,

2045
00:59:46.970 --> 00:59:47.803
listen,

2046
00:59:48.170 --> 00:59:50.240
not only have I always felt this way,

2047
00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:54.830
but the overwhelming evidence is that anybody or most people who become

2048
00:59:54.831 --> 00:59:57.710
transgender or go through gender reassignment surgery,

2049
00:59:58.190 --> 01:00:00.080
if you look at how they always felt,

2050
01:00:00.081 --> 01:00:01.190
if you ask them,

2051
01:00:01.730 --> 01:00:03.140
they always felt this way.

2052
01:00:03.141 --> 01:00:06.860
Kind of like the way somebody who was gay generally usually will say,

2053
01:00:06.861 --> 01:00:08.750
I've always been attracted to the same sex.

2054
01:00:09.260 --> 01:00:09.771
So when you,

2055
01:00:09.771 --> 01:00:13.820
when you frame it that way and you see it and you see a person that you know is

2056
01:00:13.850 --> 01:00:17.030
very real to you in an acting the way everybody else does,

2057
01:00:17.300 --> 01:00:18.920
it's hard not to empathize.

2058
01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:20.390
It's hard not to have compassion.

2059
01:00:20.391 --> 01:00:20.871
So that,

2060
01:00:20.871 --> 01:00:22.430
that in that sense,

2061
01:00:22.610 --> 01:00:26.360
information is nudging us all together,

2062
01:00:26.361 --> 01:00:29.750
all closer or at least at least I think you're right.

2063
01:00:29.751 --> 01:00:31.370
We are becoming nicer,

2064
01:00:31.700 --> 01:00:32.420
more gentle.

2065
01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:33.181
We want understand it.

2066
01:00:33.181 --> 01:00:33.351
Yeah.

2067
01:00:33.351 --> 01:00:35.420
We're becoming more aware of our,

2068
01:00:36.260 --> 01:00:38.960
of our similarities as opposed to differences.

2069
01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:39.291
Yeah.

2070
01:00:39.291 --> 01:00:40.760
Focusing on our differences.

2071
01:00:41.300 --> 01:00:42.920
I think the similarities,

2072
01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:43.670
what's,

2073
01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:45.110
what's super important,

2074
01:00:45.140 --> 01:00:46.190
like the core,

2075
01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:49.040
the core process is how we treat each other.

2076
01:00:49.070 --> 01:00:50.540
That's what's super important.

2077
01:00:50.990 --> 01:00:55.990
And if we're treating each other in a negative way simply because of some ideas

2078
01:00:58.191 --> 01:01:03.080
that we might have on who a person should or shouldn't be,

2079
01:01:03.081 --> 01:01:05.120
whether or not you should sleep with men like that,

2080
01:01:05.150 --> 01:01:06.260
that's one of the best ones.

2081
01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:06.800
Like the,

2082
01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:09.770
or whether or not like I retweeted something from,

2083
01:01:09.771 --> 01:01:10.250
um,

2084
01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:11.630
the 1930s,

2085
01:01:11.631 --> 01:01:12.351
I believe it was,

2086
01:01:12.351 --> 01:01:15.860
where a woman was going to jail for being a lesbian.

2087
01:01:16.490 --> 01:01:17.540
It's a crazy picture,

2088
01:01:17.770 --> 01:01:18.080
Jamie.

2089
01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:18.920
See if he could pull it up.

2090
01:01:19.250 --> 01:01:19.521
It's,

2091
01:01:19.521 --> 01:01:20.354
uh,

2092
01:01:20.390 --> 01:01:21.051
it's on my,

2093
01:01:21.051 --> 01:01:21.440
uh,

2094
01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:24.350
my Twitter feed somewhere not that far down.

2095
01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:26.810
It's from a old picks archives.

2096
01:01:26.930 --> 01:01:31.190
It's from 1940 when as a kid it was a crime to be a homosexual.

2097
01:01:31.191 --> 01:01:32.024
And this woman,

2098
01:01:32.330 --> 01:01:33.163
you know,

2099
01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:33.741
she's,

2100
01:01:33.741 --> 01:01:34.230
uh,

2101
01:01:34.230 --> 01:01:34.560
they're,

2102
01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:36.800
they're given her a mugshot for being a lesbian.

2103
01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:37.491
It's like,

2104
01:01:37.491 --> 01:01:38.450
just think about that.

2105
01:01:38.451 --> 01:01:39.500
That's not that long ago,

2106
01:01:39.501 --> 01:01:40.160
man.

2107
01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:41.660
So it was at 75 years ago.

2108
01:01:41.750 --> 01:01:42.380
Look at that.

2109
01:01:42.380 --> 01:01:43.213
That's horrible.

2110
01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:43.790
Yeah.

2111
01:01:43.790 --> 01:01:44.870
That's scary to think of,

2112
01:01:44.871 --> 01:01:45.320
man.

2113
01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:46.340
That that,

2114
01:01:46.850 --> 01:01:49.340
that's how how fucked up people can be.

2115
01:01:49.350 --> 01:01:50.540
That's how ignorant people could be.

2116
01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:51.291
We just,

2117
01:01:51.291 --> 01:01:52.820
it hasn't been that long.

2118
01:01:53.090 --> 01:01:55.490
It hasn't been that long since we've had civilization.

2119
01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:56.390
No,

2120
01:01:56.390 --> 01:01:58.100
it's only been a few thousand years.

2121
01:01:58.150 --> 01:01:58.640
It really,

2122
01:01:58.640 --> 01:01:58.941
I mean,

2123
01:01:58.941 --> 01:02:01.460
the civilization they have a few thousand years ago too,

2124
01:02:01.461 --> 01:02:02.120
by the way.

2125
01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:02.960
You can keep it.

2126
01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:03.350
Yeah,

2127
01:02:03.350 --> 01:02:03.960
you can keep it.

2128
01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:05.270
Do you mean before anesthesia?

2129
01:02:05.510 --> 01:02:06.290
Antibiotics,

2130
01:02:06.290 --> 01:02:10.310
put the fucking Romans all the horrible shit that you heard people did back then

2131
01:02:10.311 --> 01:02:11.470
and war and that,

2132
01:02:11.471 --> 01:02:16.010
that's a really interesting point because the Romans and the models that,

2133
01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:16.491
you know,

2134
01:02:16.491 --> 01:02:17.360
back then it was,

2135
01:02:17.450 --> 01:02:18.890
it was excused enough to just to say,

2136
01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:19.800
I'm stronger.

2137
01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:20.820
<v 2>I own you.</v>

2138
01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:21.301
Oh,

2139
01:02:21.301 --> 01:02:22.134
and by the way,

2140
01:02:22.350 --> 01:02:24.030
slavery was the order of the day.

2141
01:02:24.060 --> 01:02:25.920
You took human beings as property.

2142
01:02:25.950 --> 01:02:26.490
Always.

2143
01:02:26.490 --> 01:02:27.330
Nowadays,

2144
01:02:27.331 --> 01:02:32.040
what's interesting is that when any country does something that's bad,

2145
01:02:32.380 --> 01:02:32.610
uh,

2146
01:02:32.610 --> 01:02:34.680
Russia in Ukraine,

2147
01:02:34.710 --> 01:02:35.300
uh,

2148
01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:37.410
it couldn't just say they were trying to annex territory.

2149
01:02:37.770 --> 01:02:39.840
They justify what they were doing into the,

2150
01:02:39.870 --> 01:02:40.171
the,

2151
01:02:40.171 --> 01:02:42.300
the Putin regime justifies what they're,

2152
01:02:42.330 --> 01:02:44.190
what they're doing be on,

2153
01:02:44.191 --> 01:02:44.491
on,

2154
01:02:44.491 --> 01:02:45.211
on the idea that,

2155
01:02:45.211 --> 01:02:45.421
look,

2156
01:02:45.421 --> 01:02:48.090
we're just protecting our Russian people that are there.

2157
01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:49.890
No matter who you're talking to,

2158
01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:52.470
no matter what country you're talking to in the matter is Syria,

2159
01:02:52.650 --> 01:02:53.940
when they're bombing the rebels,

2160
01:02:53.941 --> 01:02:54.510
whatever.

2161
01:02:54.510 --> 01:02:55.141
Syria,

2162
01:02:55.141 --> 01:02:55.980
the Assad regime,

2163
01:02:55.981 --> 01:02:59.040
we'll talk about the fact that they are protecting a lot of different

2164
01:02:59.041 --> 01:03:01.140
communities in a very diverse country,

2165
01:03:01.770 --> 01:03:02.311
et cetera,

2166
01:03:02.311 --> 01:03:02.701
et cetera.

2167
01:03:02.701 --> 01:03:07.680
And what I think is interesting is that with so many people watching anybody

2168
01:03:07.681 --> 01:03:10.920
who's doing anything that could be considered violent,

2169
01:03:11.140 --> 01:03:11.960
uh,

2170
01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:12.540
you know,

2171
01:03:12.540 --> 01:03:13.470
murderous,

2172
01:03:13.710 --> 01:03:17.730
bad in general must be justified along moral grounds.

2173
01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:19.830
It's no longer allowed to say,

2174
01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:22.500
we're fucking taken over your country because we're,

2175
01:03:22.501 --> 01:03:24.480
Romans and Romans are better.

2176
01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:28.920
That used to be all the excuse they needed were Romans.

2177
01:03:29.220 --> 01:03:31.410
We have a right to everything.

2178
01:03:31.411 --> 01:03:36.411
We can see it belongs to us because we are superior and everyone else is not.

2179
01:03:38.370 --> 01:03:40.020
So they can either die,

2180
01:03:40.650 --> 01:03:42.930
get out of the way or be our slaves.

2181
01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:43.121
Well,

2182
01:03:43.121 --> 01:03:44.790
that was the only way you survived.

2183
01:03:44.791 --> 01:03:48.630
But then as if you were the stronger one with that attitude because that was the

2184
01:03:48.631 --> 01:03:50.040
attitude that you were going to encounter.

2185
01:03:50.270 --> 01:03:50.790
Yeah,

2186
01:03:50.790 --> 01:03:51.640
like the,

2187
01:03:51.670 --> 01:03:54.540
the what the Mongols did when they found a new civilization,

2188
01:03:54.570 --> 01:03:56.430
like when they found the pope,

2189
01:03:56.580 --> 01:03:58.350
the first contact with the pope was saying,

2190
01:03:58.380 --> 01:03:58.511
oh,

2191
01:03:58.511 --> 01:04:00.060
we're aware that you weren't aware,

2192
01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:01.770
but this is the great Khan,

2193
01:04:01.771 --> 01:04:03.030
the Great Khan runs everything.

2194
01:04:03.031 --> 01:04:06.510
So you're going to have to pay some fucking tribute and bowed down or you're all

2195
01:04:06.511 --> 01:04:07.344
dead.

2196
01:04:07.380 --> 01:04:08.213
Like that's it.

2197
01:04:08.340 --> 01:04:09.173
It's how it goes.

2198
01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:10.770
And that was what they did.

2199
01:04:10.771 --> 01:04:10.971
They,

2200
01:04:10.971 --> 01:04:13.830
they believe they ruled over everything on the earth,

2201
01:04:14.070 --> 01:04:15.360
like didn't have a territory,

2202
01:04:15.510 --> 01:04:16.560
what territory,

2203
01:04:16.710 --> 01:04:17.820
what the whole thing.

2204
01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:19.440
They wanted the whole earth.

2205
01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:25.040
And that was the standard operational behavior of like the classic marauders.

2206
01:04:25.410 --> 01:04:25.680
Yeah.

2207
01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:26.880
From a thousand to,

2208
01:04:26.940 --> 01:04:30.090
I mean that was the 12 hundreds imagine it was like a thousand years before that

2209
01:04:30.091 --> 01:04:32.640
where they were really savages or 2000 years before the,

2210
01:04:32.641 --> 01:04:36.630
it raises questions about whether this stuff is endemic to human beings.

2211
01:04:36.631 --> 01:04:36.990
Like they,

2212
01:04:36.990 --> 01:04:40.680
they were doing the study on chimps and they have a lot of evidence.

2213
01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:41.610
They've already seen it,

2214
01:04:41.611 --> 01:04:42.690
but they have a lot of evidence,

2215
01:04:42.691 --> 01:04:46.070
even like from past chimps that you know,

2216
01:04:46.180 --> 01:04:49.980
different when they studied different areas and communities that a group of

2217
01:04:49.981 --> 01:04:50.381
large,

2218
01:04:50.381 --> 01:04:53.190
a large group of males will come in and,

2219
01:04:53.220 --> 01:04:57.750
and overrun a smaller group of males in an isolated area and kill them,

2220
01:04:57.990 --> 01:04:59.370
beat the fucking shit out of him,

2221
01:04:59.371 --> 01:05:00.204
kill him,

2222
01:05:00.420 --> 01:05:04.230
and come in and either kill the kids or you know,

2223
01:05:04.380 --> 01:05:05.340
have sex with a women.

2224
01:05:05.820 --> 01:05:06.481
Very human,

2225
01:05:06.481 --> 01:05:07.314
like behavior.

2226
01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:08.273
Very typical.

2227
01:05:08.490 --> 01:05:13.490
And it used to be that the idea that human beings were violent like that was

2228
01:05:13.591 --> 01:05:17.500
because we didn't know any better and that it wasn't a natural impulse.

2229
01:05:17.770 --> 01:05:18.250
In fact,

2230
01:05:18.250 --> 01:05:18.850
<v 1>uh,</v>

2231
01:05:18.850 --> 01:05:20.650
we're not naturally violent because kids aren't.

2232
01:05:20.970 --> 01:05:21.360
Uh,

2233
01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:26.360
and so that's a learned behavior problem is you see that kind of behavior in the

2234
01:05:26.441 --> 01:05:27.190
animal world.

2235
01:05:27.190 --> 01:05:32.190
You see it among dolphins and you see it among chimps and you certainly see it

2236
01:05:33.790 --> 01:05:38.790
in spades in indigenous cultures that have had very little contact with other

2237
01:05:39.761 --> 01:05:40.241
cultures,

2238
01:05:40.241 --> 01:05:41.920
had not shared information with other cultures.

2239
01:05:41.950 --> 01:05:42.151
Well,

2240
01:05:42.151 --> 01:05:43.510
if there's no civilization,

2241
01:05:43.511 --> 01:05:45.220
if you don't have an infrastructure,

2242
01:05:45.221 --> 01:05:49.000
if you don't have foods coming in and then you see you have struggle and when

2243
01:05:49.001 --> 01:05:49.811
you have struggle,

2244
01:05:49.811 --> 01:05:50.644
you have danger.

2245
01:05:50.890 --> 01:05:51.940
When you have danger,

2246
01:05:51.941 --> 01:05:55.450
you have people that are going to take advantage of people that are weaker than

2247
01:05:55.451 --> 01:05:56.460
them and you,

2248
01:05:56.470 --> 01:05:59.830
you have a breakdown of what we consider civilization.

2249
01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:00.460
I mean,

2250
01:06:00.460 --> 01:06:04.450
and when you get into these really rural communities like the further and

2251
01:06:04.451 --> 01:06:05.620
further back in time,

2252
01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:08.380
the more and more prevalent that shit's going to be.

2253
01:06:08.410 --> 01:06:12.370
That's the way p scarcity also changes the way your brain behaves.

2254
01:06:12.450 --> 01:06:12.570
Oh,

2255
01:06:12.570 --> 01:06:13.091
of course.

2256
01:06:13.091 --> 01:06:14.380
You get competitive.

2257
01:06:14.381 --> 01:06:15.640
It gets super dangerous.

2258
01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:21.000
I think that people are capable of amazing feats of kindness and people are

2259
01:06:21.011 --> 01:06:25.600
awesome to be around and people are also unfucking believably evil.

2260
01:06:25.630 --> 01:06:26.110
Yeah.

2261
01:06:26.110 --> 01:06:27.610
Like if you look at that isis video,

2262
01:06:27.611 --> 01:06:28.420
I didn't watch it,

2263
01:06:28.420 --> 01:06:32.200
but it was described to me of the Jordanian pilot who was lit on fire.

2264
01:06:32.350 --> 01:06:35.140
They did it in slow mo from different angles.

2265
01:06:35.141 --> 01:06:35.441
I mean,

2266
01:06:35.441 --> 01:06:36.274
they filmed it,

2267
01:06:36.310 --> 01:06:37.121
they set it up,

2268
01:06:37.121 --> 01:06:38.080
they set up a shot,

2269
01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:41.050
and then they filmed this guy getting burned to death.

2270
01:06:41.470 --> 01:06:46.090
The fact that people are capable of that kind of cruelty to each other.

2271
01:06:46.570 --> 01:06:50.800
And at the same time there's selfless people that are out there like Justin

2272
01:06:50.801 --> 01:06:51.191
wren,

2273
01:06:51.191 --> 01:06:54.280
who's living with the pygmies in the Congo and he's digging wells for them.

2274
01:06:54.610 --> 01:06:54.791
Well,

2275
01:06:54.791 --> 01:06:56.170
they always say human beings,

2276
01:06:56.290 --> 01:06:56.951
not all day,

2277
01:06:56.951 --> 01:06:58.450
but that the book our inner ape,

2278
01:06:58.690 --> 01:06:58.961
he,

2279
01:06:58.961 --> 01:07:01.510
the author says that we are a bipolar ape.

2280
01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:04.600
We're a bipolar AYP capable of incredible cruelty,

2281
01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:05.620
incredible kindness,

2282
01:07:05.950 --> 01:07:07.210
incredible acts of destruction,

2283
01:07:07.211 --> 01:07:08.410
incredible acts of beauty.

2284
01:07:08.790 --> 01:07:09.060
Uh,

2285
01:07:09.060 --> 01:07:10.110
and that's the,

2286
01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:12.910
that is called the problem of humanity.

2287
01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:14.590
That is exactly what we are.

2288
01:07:14.591 --> 01:07:15.160
We're this,

2289
01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:15.581
well,

2290
01:07:15.581 --> 01:07:17.890
we're also in this constant state of struggle.

2291
01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:21.410
And I think one of the things that people are like the,

2292
01:07:21.411 --> 01:07:21.680
the,

2293
01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:26.260
the negative push that I totally understand against masculine thinking and

2294
01:07:26.261 --> 01:07:31.261
masculine behavior is that we're moving towards this more aware,

2295
01:07:31.481 --> 01:07:32.530
more sensitive,

2296
01:07:32.531 --> 01:07:34.930
more or kind society.

2297
01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:39.820
And the further you move away from those roots of the ancient barbarians,

2298
01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.530
the better off we're going to be.

2299
01:07:41.531 --> 01:07:42.070
Maybe,

2300
01:07:42.070 --> 01:07:42.520
maybe,

2301
01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:43.353
maybe,

2302
01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:48.360
but I would also suggest that male aggression and fucking playing on your belt.

2303
01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:54.700
I'm playing on my belt as I'm talking about this and I'll talk around male

2304
01:07:54.701 --> 01:07:55.534
aggression.

2305
01:07:55.600 --> 01:07:56.021
That's like,

2306
01:07:56.021 --> 01:07:58.920
it's funny how different tellers naturally to hose.

2307
01:07:59.160 --> 01:07:59.981
I'll tell you what,

2308
01:07:59.981 --> 01:08:02.690
boys can do some pull up a chair bars.

2309
01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:03.761
How many guys do that?

2310
01:08:03.761 --> 01:08:05.470
They pull up their belt and they got about Tyson.

2311
01:08:05.471 --> 01:08:05.861
I'm serious.

2312
01:08:05.861 --> 01:08:06.550
Listen here.

2313
01:08:06.550 --> 01:08:07.330
Don Frye.

2314
01:08:07.330 --> 01:08:08.163
Tell you what,

2315
01:08:08.340 --> 01:08:09.340
let's that's a man's man.

2316
01:08:09.341 --> 01:08:10.780
That's a management saw him yesterday.

2317
01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:11.520
I was,

2318
01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:11.770
I,

2319
01:08:11.770 --> 01:08:12.940
I obsessed.

2320
01:08:13.310 --> 01:08:14.020
Um,

2321
01:08:14.020 --> 01:08:16.040
but I think aggression

2322
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:19.160
<v 0>has also given us so many of the goodies.</v>

2323
01:08:19.510 --> 01:08:19.670
Uh,

2324
01:08:19.670 --> 01:08:23.750
you want to go through the list of heaps of fresh vegetables in the middle of

2325
01:08:23.751 --> 01:08:24.584
the wintertime.

2326
01:08:24.860 --> 01:08:25.610
Um,

2327
01:08:25.610 --> 01:08:28.670
all the inventions that push us beyond our biology,

2328
01:08:29.060 --> 01:08:30.380
they takes,

2329
01:08:30.381 --> 01:08:32.870
it requires a little aggression.

2330
01:08:33.020 --> 01:08:34.850
I think sometimes,

2331
01:08:34.851 --> 01:08:35.684
and even,

2332
01:08:35.810 --> 01:08:36.980
God forbid I say it,

2333
01:08:37.130 --> 01:08:38.120
competition,

2334
01:08:38.121 --> 01:08:39.410
ruthless competition.

2335
01:08:39.950 --> 01:08:40.370
Uh,

2336
01:08:40.370 --> 01:08:41.570
that's how things progressed.

2337
01:08:41.590 --> 01:08:44.180
The problem with that is that people are going to lose and people don't like

2338
01:08:44.181 --> 01:08:46.100
losing cause they think losing is a bad feelings.

2339
01:08:46.101 --> 01:08:49.280
So they think of competition and competitive people as being negative.

2340
01:08:49.281 --> 01:08:49.671
Okay.

2341
01:08:49.671 --> 01:08:50.421
So that's what,

2342
01:08:50.421 --> 01:08:55.421
that's my worry about the feminization quote unquote of our society.

2343
01:08:57.080 --> 01:09:00.860
I think that we have to be very careful that we,

2344
01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:05.880
we don't forget the positive aspects of what you'd call unoriginal,

2345
01:09:06.830 --> 01:09:07.790
macho energy.

2346
01:09:07.820 --> 01:09:10.730
I think the problem is that it's not masculine energy.

2347
01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:12.950
That's a problem that people are upset about.

2348
01:09:13.010 --> 01:09:14.360
I think it gets misconstrued.

2349
01:09:14.361 --> 01:09:17.720
I think the problem that we all have is with assholes.

2350
01:09:17.940 --> 01:09:18.350
Yeah.

2351
01:09:18.350 --> 01:09:19.340
That is the problem.

2352
01:09:19.370 --> 01:09:20.330
It's right across the board,

2353
01:09:20.331 --> 01:09:21.830
whether it's women or it's men.

2354
01:09:22.010 --> 01:09:27.010
When you see like these crazy radical feminists who a attack speakers because

2355
01:09:27.441 --> 01:09:32.441
they want to support men's rights in divorce court and whatever the fucking

2356
01:09:33.171 --> 01:09:34.970
reason is that the really aggressive,

2357
01:09:34.971 --> 01:09:39.971
like this is archetypal video of this super aggressive feminist outside of this

2358
01:09:40.251 --> 01:09:44.000
thing and Toronto and she's got red hair and she's screaming at people like what

2359
01:09:44.001 --> 01:09:47.600
she wants and what she doesn't want from men when they can shut the fuck up and

2360
01:09:47.870 --> 01:09:48.270
you know,

2361
01:09:48.270 --> 01:09:49.790
and she's telling people in the honest,

2362
01:09:49.791 --> 01:09:51.430
shut the fuck up the people that,

2363
01:09:51.550 --> 01:09:53.240
that that exist like that,

2364
01:09:53.540 --> 01:09:57.530
then they become the problem because the problem is not like the idea that women

2365
01:09:57.560 --> 01:10:01.370
deserve everything that men deserve and that we should have equal treatment by

2366
01:10:01.371 --> 01:10:02.120
law.

2367
01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:03.710
The problem is assholes.

2368
01:10:03.740 --> 01:10:04.130
Yeah.

2369
01:10:04.130 --> 01:10:07.640
It's assholes representing a point of view that I probably don't disagree with,

2370
01:10:07.970 --> 01:10:12.800
but I disagree with her and I disagree with someone who is generalizing about an

2371
01:10:12.801 --> 01:10:15.020
entire gender because that's ridiculous of course.

2372
01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:19.490
Or generalizing about a type of person that is in that gender.

2373
01:10:19.580 --> 01:10:20.413
Like you can't,

2374
01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:24.770
everybody is entitled to start from zero.

2375
01:10:25.190 --> 01:10:26.900
And as soon as you are prejudice,

2376
01:10:26.901 --> 01:10:30.170
whether you're prejudice against white people or whether you're prejudice

2377
01:10:30.171 --> 01:10:34.430
against men or whether you're prejudice against gays are transgenders or

2378
01:10:34.431 --> 01:10:35.420
whatever the fucking is,

2379
01:10:35.630 --> 01:10:40.100
as soon as you stop treating that person as like an we come at them from a

2380
01:10:40.101 --> 01:10:41.240
totally even spot,

2381
01:10:41.690 --> 01:10:43.070
then you're the asshole.

2382
01:10:43.100 --> 01:10:43.790
Right?

2383
01:10:43.790 --> 01:10:45.230
And I would suggest that,

2384
01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:46.071
you know,

2385
01:10:46.071 --> 01:10:51.071
we benefit also and enjoy a lot about life based on people who created things,

2386
01:10:52.551 --> 01:10:53.600
whose motives.

2387
01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:57.080
Their motives may have been less than stellar show.

2388
01:10:57.081 --> 01:10:59.720
A lot of people are driven by just pure ego,

2389
01:10:59.900 --> 01:11:00.860
domination,

2390
01:11:01.070 --> 01:11:01.903
greed,

2391
01:11:02.150 --> 01:11:03.800
and those things are not,

2392
01:11:03.830 --> 01:11:06.620
those things do not always create bad things.

2393
01:11:06.890 --> 01:11:07.221
In fact,

2394
01:11:07.221 --> 01:11:09.860
a lot of times they create incredible innovations,

2395
01:11:09.861 --> 01:11:11.060
better ways to do things.

2396
01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:12.440
You know so much.

2397
01:11:12.441 --> 01:11:12.810
What is,

2398
01:11:12.810 --> 01:11:14.280
what's another word for innovation?

2399
01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:16.650
<v 2>Another word for innovation is destruction.</v>

2400
01:11:16.890 --> 01:11:20.040
You're destroying how people used to do it.

2401
01:11:20.310 --> 01:11:22.230
When we came up with,

2402
01:11:22.580 --> 01:11:22.920
uh,

2403
01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:26.070
the combustion internal combustion engine and put it in a vehicle and turn it

2404
01:11:26.071 --> 01:11:26.904
into a car.

2405
01:11:27.420 --> 01:11:32.420
People that made a lot of money making buggy whips went out of fucking business.

2406
01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:34.061
I said,

2407
01:11:34.061 --> 01:11:37.770
I don't need your fucking Buggy whip because my car doesn't respond to buggy

2408
01:11:37.771 --> 01:11:38.280
whips.

2409
01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:40.590
It responds to what I call rock oil,

2410
01:11:40.830 --> 01:11:42.000
which turned out to be oil.

2411
01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:43.020
So,

2412
01:11:43.020 --> 01:11:43.740
you know,

2413
01:11:43.740 --> 01:11:45.120
that's the other thing to keep in mind.

2414
01:11:45.150 --> 01:11:48.930
Innovation is isn't aggressive.

2415
01:11:49.050 --> 01:11:50.190
It's competition thing.

2416
01:11:50.191 --> 01:11:51.090
It's competition.

2417
01:11:51.091 --> 01:11:52.140
It's destruction.

2418
01:11:52.290 --> 01:11:53.011
Well we,

2419
01:11:53.011 --> 01:11:53.311
you know,

2420
01:11:53.311 --> 01:11:55.290
we deal with that all the time with businesses,

2421
01:11:55.291 --> 01:11:55.830
right?

2422
01:11:55.830 --> 01:12:00.830
When businesses start to get pressure in the marketplace from other outside

2423
01:12:01.321 --> 01:12:03.450
businesses and you deal with this,

2424
01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:05.520
this weird thing that happens with a,

2425
01:12:05.550 --> 01:12:06.383
with commerce,

2426
01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:06.931
you know,

2427
01:12:06.931 --> 01:12:10.500
it becomes as does gigantic contest and some aspects of it,

2428
01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:12.090
we feel like we need to save.

2429
01:12:12.330 --> 01:12:14.170
Like that's what happened and that's why I'm thinking business,

2430
01:12:14.171 --> 01:12:14.370
right?

2431
01:12:14.370 --> 01:12:15.270
They go to the government and say,

2432
01:12:15.271 --> 01:12:15.530
yeah,

2433
01:12:15.530 --> 01:12:16.410
don't let us fail.

2434
01:12:16.590 --> 01:12:16.801
Well,

2435
01:12:16.801 --> 01:12:17.041
what's,

2436
01:12:17.041 --> 01:12:18.900
what's really interesting to me is like there's,

2437
01:12:19.230 --> 01:12:20.720
there's people that got bailouts,

2438
01:12:20.820 --> 01:12:21.001
right?

2439
01:12:21.001 --> 01:12:22.080
Like who got bailouts?

2440
01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:24.360
Almost all of the banks almost call them Sachs,

2441
01:12:24.361 --> 01:12:24.960
et cetera.

2442
01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:27.630
With the other businesses that got bail outs as well.

2443
01:12:27.631 --> 01:12:28.464
Or just banks,

2444
01:12:28.470 --> 01:12:29.310
the car,

2445
01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:32.130
the car industry was bailed out as well.

2446
01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:33.870
Turned out both cases.

2447
01:12:33.871 --> 01:12:34.610
By the way,

2448
01:12:34.610 --> 01:12:36.720
it turned out to be success stories to an extent.

2449
01:12:36.990 --> 01:12:37.471
They really,

2450
01:12:37.471 --> 01:12:37.711
Dave.

2451
01:12:37.711 --> 01:12:39.390
So they made the money and well,

2452
01:12:39.391 --> 01:12:42.740
GM especially has made some amazing fucking cars.

2453
01:12:42.750 --> 01:12:43.310
Yeah,

2454
01:12:43.310 --> 01:12:45.630
but how is your respect to the Ford didn't take any money.

2455
01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:46.590
They're like,

2456
01:12:46.590 --> 01:12:49.160
they were doing well enough and I don't remember why,

2457
01:12:49.161 --> 01:12:50.040
but they use trucks.

2458
01:12:50.770 --> 01:12:51.440
Yeah.

2459
01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:52.710
A Ford pickup trucks.

2460
01:12:52.750 --> 01:12:54.780
They sell a lot of fucking trucks,

2461
01:12:54.781 --> 01:12:54.990
dude.

2462
01:12:54.990 --> 01:12:55.440
Yeah.

2463
01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:56.480
Everywhere you go,

2464
01:12:56.510 --> 01:12:59.310
you go to like a hunting ranch or you go to a cattle ranches.

2465
01:12:59.311 --> 01:13:02.340
They drive those fucking F150 bulletproof what?

2466
01:13:02.341 --> 01:13:05.190
Bankrupt a lot of companies where their pension plans.

2467
01:13:05.430 --> 01:13:06.930
So you would retire,

2468
01:13:07.180 --> 01:13:09.180
they'd pay medical benefits for your entire family,

2469
01:13:09.181 --> 01:13:10.020
for the rest of your life.

2470
01:13:10.021 --> 01:13:11.880
And you got 95% of your salary.

2471
01:13:11.881 --> 01:13:12.091
I mean,

2472
01:13:12.091 --> 01:13:12.541
here's the,

2473
01:13:12.541 --> 01:13:13.050
uh,

2474
01:13:13.050 --> 01:13:14.160
here's the payoff.

2475
01:13:15.030 --> 01:13:15.731
So what is the,

2476
01:13:15.731 --> 01:13:16.171
the money?

2477
01:13:16.171 --> 01:13:17.850
549 billion.

2478
01:13:17.851 --> 01:13:18.870
That's how much they got.

2479
01:13:18.900 --> 01:13:19.410
Keeping my,

2480
01:13:19.410 --> 01:13:21.690
everybody keep in mind a billion.

2481
01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:24.150
A billion seconds is 33 years roughly.

2482
01:13:24.450 --> 01:13:25.051
So that's what,

2483
01:13:25.051 --> 01:13:26.300
that's how much $1 billion isn't it?

2484
01:13:26.301 --> 01:13:28.440
But they're not giving him seconds to giving them dollars.

2485
01:13:28.730 --> 01:13:29.880
Thousand million.

2486
01:13:30.030 --> 01:13:32.310
So 549 is that what it was?

2487
01:13:32.340 --> 01:13:33.450
549 billion.

2488
01:13:34.140 --> 01:13:35.430
Insane.

2489
01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:36.600
That hurts.

2490
01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:38.700
I believe the banks paid off that money though.

2491
01:13:38.790 --> 01:13:40.860
I'm sorry if I'm looking at those numbers.

2492
01:13:40.861 --> 01:13:41.461
For the most part,

2493
01:13:41.461 --> 01:13:42.211
they all paid it off.

2494
01:13:42.211 --> 01:13:43.650
The government made a lot of money off that deal.

2495
01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:44.100
Really?

2496
01:13:44.100 --> 01:13:44.341
Yes.

2497
01:13:44.341 --> 01:13:45.174
Cause they got interest.

2498
01:13:45.220 --> 01:13:45.660
Wow.

2499
01:13:45.660 --> 01:13:47.130
So they made actually a lot more money.

2500
01:13:47.310 --> 01:13:48.130
No Sham.

2501
01:13:48.130 --> 01:13:48.963
Yep.

2502
01:13:48.980 --> 01:13:49.890
The banks paid back.

2503
01:13:49.891 --> 01:13:50.460
What did they do?

2504
01:13:50.460 --> 01:13:53.580
What they earn that they got from it?

2505
01:13:53.790 --> 01:13:56.020
What happens is that then they pay it back with interest and no,

2506
01:13:56.021 --> 01:13:56.101
no,

2507
01:13:56.101 --> 01:13:56.371
no.

2508
01:13:56.371 --> 01:13:57.151
I run the government.

2509
01:13:57.151 --> 01:13:58.380
What does the government do with that money?

2510
01:13:58.770 --> 01:13:59.980
I don't really know.

2511
01:13:59.981 --> 01:14:02.410
Getting back to the people that paid the taxes due the it's,

2512
01:14:02.460 --> 01:14:04.890
it does things like builds roads and things I guess.

2513
01:14:04.891 --> 01:14:07.230
And maybe they don't have to account for it.

2514
01:14:07.260 --> 01:14:08.730
It's the most ridiculous system ever.

2515
01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:08.911
Well,

2516
01:14:08.911 --> 01:14:10.230
we know that when you throw money,

2517
01:14:10.231 --> 01:14:11.064
just money at a,

2518
01:14:11.230 --> 01:14:11.981
like in Baltimore,

2519
01:14:11.981 --> 01:14:12.401
I believe,

2520
01:14:12.401 --> 01:14:14.320
which is the worst school system in the country.

2521
01:14:14.650 --> 01:14:15.100
Uh,

2522
01:14:15.100 --> 01:14:20.100
I think we spend federal dollars that we spend more money on per student is the

2523
01:14:20.951 --> 01:14:25.951
third most amount of spending per student than any other town or state in the

2524
01:14:27.071 --> 01:14:27.904
union.

2525
01:14:27.910 --> 01:14:28.780
That's kind of amazing.

2526
01:14:28.781 --> 01:14:32.310
And guess what a d you can't just throw money at a problem know,

2527
01:14:32.430 --> 01:14:32.700
so,

2528
01:14:32.700 --> 01:14:36.430
so many of these issues that I'm kind of becoming fascinated with her don't

2529
01:14:36.431 --> 01:14:40.450
require money or it's not a democratic or republican issue.

2530
01:14:40.451 --> 01:14:41.284
For example,

2531
01:14:41.290 --> 01:14:45.400
one of the prob biggest challenges we're gonna face is that there are a lot of

2532
01:14:45.401 --> 01:14:50.401
people out there who don't fit into the 21st century economy.

2533
01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:53.530
They don't have skillset that requires that.

2534
01:14:53.531 --> 01:14:54.300
So you can,

2535
01:14:54.300 --> 01:14:58.120
they do manual labor or they do a minimum wage jobs.

2536
01:14:58.300 --> 01:15:00.310
You can raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour,

2537
01:15:00.311 --> 01:15:00.671
I guess.

2538
01:15:00.671 --> 01:15:02.170
I don't know what it's like to run a small business.

2539
01:15:02.171 --> 01:15:03.880
I know a lot of small business people say that's too much.

2540
01:15:03.910 --> 01:15:04.720
I don't know.

2541
01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:07.570
But that's actually not the problem.

2542
01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:10.990
Every time you hear Democrats or Republicans talking,

2543
01:15:10.991 --> 01:15:12.280
they say things like,

2544
01:15:12.430 --> 01:15:13.263
Hey man,

2545
01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:13.690
uh,

2546
01:15:13.690 --> 01:15:13.991
you know,

2547
01:15:13.991 --> 01:15:17.020
we gotta do something about this income inequality.

2548
01:15:17.020 --> 01:15:19.690
So the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer and we got a tax,

2549
01:15:19.691 --> 01:15:20.270
the rich,

2550
01:15:20.270 --> 01:15:21.400
well everybody has their point of view.

2551
01:15:21.430 --> 01:15:21.611
No,

2552
01:15:21.611 --> 01:15:26.611
it trickle down economics problem is in fact that what's really going on is

2553
01:15:26.801 --> 01:15:31.801
technology is taking the place of a lot of these unskilled jobs and we are going

2554
01:15:32.531 --> 01:15:33.011
to have,

2555
01:15:33.011 --> 01:15:35.140
as technology grows exponentially,

2556
01:15:36.010 --> 01:15:40.960
robots and different forms of technology are going to take over so many of the

2557
01:15:40.961 --> 01:15:42.640
jobs that people have now.

2558
01:15:42.670 --> 01:15:43.503
Bus Drivers,

2559
01:15:43.660 --> 01:15:45.040
we're going to have autonomous vehicles.

2560
01:15:45.041 --> 01:15:46.120
I don't know when it's going to be,

2561
01:15:46.330 --> 01:15:47.920
but bus drivers will be out of business,

2562
01:15:47.950 --> 01:15:50.710
out of work and there are so many examples of that.

2563
01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:56.230
What we have to start doing rather than worrying about redistributing wealth.

2564
01:15:56.500 --> 01:16:01.500
The most important thing is getting these people ready for the 21st century

2565
01:16:03.191 --> 01:16:03.670
economy,

2566
01:16:03.670 --> 01:16:06.280
which is probably going to change all the time,

2567
01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:11.640
which means you got to figure out how you're going to fit in to an economy that

2568
01:16:11.921 --> 01:16:15.220
doesn't operate the way traditional economies work anymore.

2569
01:16:15.370 --> 01:16:16.570
There's just different needs,

2570
01:16:16.571 --> 01:16:17.381
different services.

2571
01:16:17.381 --> 01:16:18.340
Things are always changing.

2572
01:16:18.341 --> 01:16:19.270
Things are very trendy.

2573
01:16:19.990 --> 01:16:23.470
That's the biggest challenge and that's a hard fucking pill to swallow for

2574
01:16:23.471 --> 01:16:26.830
someone who loved their entire family's existence on horse shoes.

2575
01:16:26.860 --> 01:16:27.550
Damn right.

2576
01:16:27.550 --> 01:16:27.911
Also,

2577
01:16:27.911 --> 01:16:30.850
this goddamn engine thing comes along and no one needs a fucking horse shit.

2578
01:16:30.851 --> 01:16:31.870
You can't go to the government and say,

2579
01:16:31.871 --> 01:16:31.961
Hey,

2580
01:16:31.961 --> 01:16:32.321
government,

2581
01:16:32.321 --> 01:16:36.550
bail me out and give me subsidies for the rest of my life because somebody has

2582
01:16:36.551 --> 01:16:38.770
to pay for that and that's all of us.

2583
01:16:39.130 --> 01:16:42.520
And so taxes get higher and that's what we have to be careful of.

2584
01:16:42.540 --> 01:16:42.630
I,

2585
01:16:42.630 --> 01:16:43.600
I just really,

2586
01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:44.980
there is a place for government,

2587
01:16:44.981 --> 01:16:47.590
but you have to be careful of saying,

2588
01:16:47.591 --> 01:16:48.011
hey,

2589
01:16:48.011 --> 01:16:50.500
the government's gonna come in here and save the day.

2590
01:16:50.860 --> 01:16:51.131
It's,

2591
01:16:51.131 --> 01:16:52.480
it's a banquet way of thinking.

2592
01:16:52.630 --> 01:16:54.250
You've got to evolve gotta change.

2593
01:16:54.340 --> 01:16:55.240
You've gotta be honest.

2594
01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:56.193
You gotta be honest.

2595
01:16:56.680 --> 01:16:57.191
This is a,

2596
01:16:57.191 --> 01:17:01.510
this might be a skill that's no longer needed and robots are going to change

2597
01:17:01.511 --> 01:17:02.050
everything.

2598
01:17:02.050 --> 01:17:03.190
They are going to change everything.

2599
01:17:03.191 --> 01:17:06.640
And then when you get intelligent robots and you have like these robots slaves,

2600
01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:08.710
you're going to have robots that are going to do all your,

2601
01:17:09.740 --> 01:17:10.000
or

2602
01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:13.190
<v 1>you're going to have absolute precise measurements on things.</v>

2603
01:17:13.191 --> 01:17:16.700
You'll have a robot that's building houses like are like a human being built

2604
01:17:16.701 --> 01:17:18.170
houses but robots,

2605
01:17:18.290 --> 01:17:22.400
robots walking up stairs carrying gigantic bags of cement with no strain in

2606
01:17:22.401 --> 01:17:23.150
their back.

2607
01:17:23.150 --> 01:17:24.560
All manual labor jobs,

2608
01:17:24.590 --> 01:17:25.190
robots.

2609
01:17:25.190 --> 01:17:25.801
I don't think he has,

2610
01:17:25.801 --> 01:17:27.360
he ain't robot Santam comics guys.

2611
01:17:27.460 --> 01:17:29.650
So I think our jobs to say for at least our lifestyle,

2612
01:17:29.660 --> 01:17:31.310
we're lucky is fun.

2613
01:17:31.950 --> 01:17:35.780
Not just the obstacle mix but also that you can't,

2614
01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:37.580
you can't like fix that with a robot.

2615
01:17:37.610 --> 01:17:38.690
You can't make a robot funny.

2616
01:17:38.870 --> 01:17:41.390
But they have done some random joke generators,

2617
01:17:41.391 --> 01:17:41.901
but you know what?

2618
01:17:41.901 --> 01:17:42.720
They lack that,

2619
01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:45.110
that pop of the great bits.

2620
01:17:45.290 --> 01:17:45.710
Yeah,

2621
01:17:45.710 --> 01:17:46.511
the great bits.

2622
01:17:46.511 --> 01:17:48.770
It has this unique perspective,

2623
01:17:48.771 --> 01:17:52.730
like you're going to get a robot to mimic bill burr or I was going to say yes,

2624
01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:53.740
absolutely Joey.

2625
01:17:54.140 --> 01:17:54.780
Joey Diaz.

2626
01:17:54.780 --> 01:17:57.680
I was going to say Mitch Hedberg actually cause his absurd,

2627
01:17:57.681 --> 01:18:02.681
this point of view was like really only affective I think with his way of

2628
01:18:03.110 --> 01:18:04.260
communicating like his,

2629
01:18:04.490 --> 01:18:05.690
his style of delivery.

2630
01:18:06.410 --> 01:18:06.940
You know,

2631
01:18:06.940 --> 01:18:08.690
you're not going to figure that out with the computer.

2632
01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:09.291
You're just not,

2633
01:18:09.291 --> 01:18:10.880
not going to figure out why it's appealing.

2634
01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:12.673
It's um,

2635
01:18:13.940 --> 01:18:17.720
we're lucky shit being a person who was like getting out of school now and

2636
01:18:17.721 --> 01:18:22.721
thinking about jobs that used to exist just a short while ago that are nonsense

2637
01:18:23.151 --> 01:18:25.340
now they're just nonsense jobs.

2638
01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:28.250
Like how many people in the,

2639
01:18:28.310 --> 01:18:28.790
uh,

2640
01:18:28.790 --> 01:18:30.320
the era of,

2641
01:18:30.370 --> 01:18:30.650
you know,

2642
01:18:30.650 --> 01:18:35.650
1995 had some sort of training and school and education and technologically

2643
01:18:38.541 --> 01:18:40.700
related things and technology,

2644
01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:41.660
creative technology.

2645
01:18:41.930 --> 01:18:43.760
By the time they get out of school,

2646
01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.310
everything that they learned is irrelevant.

2647
01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:48.260
Didn't you have a problem with that,

2648
01:18:48.261 --> 01:18:49.094
Jamie,

2649
01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:50.330
to explain your problem?

2650
01:18:51.330 --> 01:18:52.610
I went to school to be like,

2651
01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:54.230
to work in a recording studio,

2652
01:18:54.260 --> 01:18:54.770
right.

2653
01:18:54.770 --> 01:18:57.350
And at worst maybe work in a radio station.

2654
01:18:57.351 --> 01:18:58.184
They would say,

2655
01:18:58.250 --> 01:19:01.790
and this is kind of like what my education has kind of turned into to be able to

2656
01:19:01.791 --> 01:19:04.100
control essentially a radio show,

2657
01:19:04.101 --> 01:19:06.860
but there are no recording studios for me to go work in.

2658
01:19:07.430 --> 01:19:08.420
They don't exist anymore.

2659
01:19:08.450 --> 01:19:09.710
There's maybe five in La,

2660
01:19:09.740 --> 01:19:10.790
there's probably a couple more than that,

2661
01:19:10.791 --> 01:19:13.370
but anyone that has been working there for last 15 years,

2662
01:19:13.371 --> 01:19:14.270
it's still working there.

2663
01:19:14.660 --> 01:19:18.380
They're not hiring new young blood to come in because they need to work for the

2664
01:19:18.381 --> 01:19:19.161
next 15 years.

2665
01:19:19.161 --> 01:19:19.720
You know what I mean?

2666
01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:23.430
But there's just not that much of a demand and they're not making music in the

2667
01:19:23.500 --> 01:19:24.141
video is either,

2668
01:19:24.141 --> 01:19:24.974
you can do it at home,

2669
01:19:25.220 --> 01:19:26.210
you can do it at home easy.

2670
01:19:26.211 --> 01:19:28.100
It used to have to have like these incredible systems.

2671
01:19:28.101 --> 01:19:28.610
Right.

2672
01:19:28.610 --> 01:19:31.980
And now you just have like a regular apple computer or even a windows computers

2673
01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:32.271
fine.

2674
01:19:32.271 --> 01:19:32.480
Right.

2675
01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:35.090
Dave girl's movie called like the sound city or something like that,

2676
01:19:35.091 --> 01:19:36.230
I believe came on a couple of years ago.

2677
01:19:36.231 --> 01:19:39.740
It's really good and kind of shows how that all happened over the last 10 years.

2678
01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:40.910
Yeah,

2679
01:19:40.910 --> 01:19:41.270
it's,

2680
01:19:41.270 --> 01:19:41.571
you're,

2681
01:19:41.571 --> 01:19:43.700
you're finding these houses for sale.

2682
01:19:43.701 --> 01:19:47.510
There's a lot of houses that have like recording studios built in them for sale,

2683
01:19:48.470 --> 01:19:49.520
but you don't need all that shit.

2684
01:19:49.530 --> 01:19:50.363
And Yeah,

2685
01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:55.040
there's a lot of those instances of,

2686
01:19:55.041 --> 01:19:55.874
um,

2687
01:19:55.910 --> 01:19:56.870
the technology,

2688
01:19:57.770 --> 01:19:59.750
the technology just doesn't wait for you.

2689
01:19:59.810 --> 01:20:00.800
Just if you,

2690
01:20:00.830 --> 01:20:04.100
if you learn computer programming pre 1990,

2691
01:20:04.820 --> 01:20:05.653
what are you gonna do today?

2692
01:20:05.870 --> 01:20:06.703
We didn't do stupid.

2693
01:20:06.830 --> 01:20:07.070
Yeah.

2694
01:20:07.070 --> 01:20:07.810
I mean do,

2695
01:20:07.810 --> 01:20:08.100
you're not

2696
01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:08.933
<v 0>old schools.</v>

2697
01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:09.660
It's,

2698
01:20:09.660 --> 01:20:10.493
um,

2699
01:20:10.530 --> 01:20:14.460
anything technologically related like banking on one thing over another.

2700
01:20:14.461 --> 01:20:18.630
Like somebody just invited me to some startup of some new,

2701
01:20:18.690 --> 01:20:19.523
um,

2702
01:20:20.230 --> 01:20:20.760
um,

2703
01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:21.061
you know,

2704
01:20:21.061 --> 01:20:22.200
multimedia,

2705
01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:23.250
um,

2706
01:20:23.250 --> 01:20:25.490
social media sort of a thing like,

2707
01:20:25.650 --> 01:20:25.980
yeah.

2708
01:20:25.980 --> 01:20:26.570
And uh,

2709
01:20:26.570 --> 01:20:27.450
I remember thinking,

2710
01:20:27.510 --> 01:20:28.590
good luck with this.

2711
01:20:28.950 --> 01:20:29.701
Like good luck.

2712
01:20:29.701 --> 01:20:31.020
Like why would I invest in,

2713
01:20:31.021 --> 01:20:34.050
in my time to try to go check out,

2714
01:20:34.051 --> 01:20:37.380
go to a speech and see like the unveiling of this thing.

2715
01:20:37.381 --> 01:20:38.700
Like if it's good,

2716
01:20:38.701 --> 01:20:40.260
it'll get online and I'll hear about it.

2717
01:20:40.261 --> 01:20:40.590
Yeah.

2718
01:20:40.590 --> 01:20:41.190
That's it.

2719
01:20:41.190 --> 01:20:41.610
Yeah,

2720
01:20:41.610 --> 01:20:42.260
that's it.

2721
01:20:42.260 --> 01:20:42.400
Yeah.

2722
01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:43.950
And you're not going to get behind anything before.

2723
01:20:43.951 --> 01:20:44.784
It's good.

2724
01:20:44.820 --> 01:20:47.220
Like you don't know why it is or why it isn't.

2725
01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:49.920
Who Said who's to say certain things catch on.

2726
01:20:49.921 --> 01:20:50.754
Certain things don't.

2727
01:20:51.060 --> 01:20:52.260
But you got to let them just catch on,

2728
01:20:52.610 --> 01:20:53.041
catch on.

2729
01:20:53.041 --> 01:20:56.520
Like I had some academics come to me because they had listened.

2730
01:20:56.520 --> 01:20:56.930
Yeah.

2731
01:20:56.930 --> 01:20:58.440
I have a lot of academics on my podcast.

2732
01:20:58.990 --> 01:21:01.650
They're all Brian Count jail and not the funding kid.

2733
01:21:01.710 --> 01:21:02.010
Uh,

2734
01:21:02.010 --> 01:21:02.843
but uh,

2735
01:21:02.910 --> 01:21:04.380
and I,

2736
01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:06.150
I had some academics come to me and say,

2737
01:21:06.151 --> 01:21:06.511
listen,

2738
01:21:06.511 --> 01:21:07.750
we want to put together a,

2739
01:21:08.020 --> 01:21:08.530
uh,

2740
01:21:08.530 --> 01:21:10.860
a convention as something called Evo Con.

2741
01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:16.590
So it's a convention on evolution and we want to get all the great minds of

2742
01:21:16.591 --> 01:21:19.410
evolution together and people that are saying and get together and have a

2743
01:21:19.411 --> 01:21:24.411
convention about evolution and with the idea that we can get that 40% of

2744
01:21:24.541 --> 01:21:28.260
Americans or whoever it is who don't believe in evolution over on our side,

2745
01:21:28.261 --> 01:21:31.620
let's give them the evidence because the scientific community science is

2746
01:21:31.621 --> 01:21:32.011
fascinating,

2747
01:21:32.011 --> 01:21:35.130
but they've done a very bad job communicating their message.

2748
01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:39.300
They don't do a good job communicating because what happens with academics and,

2749
01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:43.920
and people in that world is that they become very insular and they become very

2750
01:21:43.921 --> 01:21:44.610
incestuous.

2751
01:21:44.610 --> 01:21:48.870
And they are only talking to each other and they're not talking to people who

2752
01:21:48.871 --> 01:21:50.530
are casting votes and,

2753
01:21:50.590 --> 01:21:54.120
and who ultimately have say in public policy and stuff.

2754
01:21:54.180 --> 01:21:54.511
Well,

2755
01:21:54.511 --> 01:21:54.781
you know,

2756
01:21:54.781 --> 01:21:59.130
I learned from Kevin and photos on the podcast the other day who was a scientist

2757
01:21:59.910 --> 01:22:01.830
and works a lot with GM foods,

2758
01:22:01.831 --> 01:22:04.680
GMO foods and explaining what they really are.

2759
01:22:05.190 --> 01:22:07.770
One of the things he was talking about to me when,

2760
01:22:07.790 --> 01:22:08.550
um,

2761
01:22:08.550 --> 01:22:11.700
was that he works for the public.

2762
01:22:11.701 --> 01:22:13.230
Essentially he's a public scientist,

2763
01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:17.700
but when they research something or come to some conclusions,

2764
01:22:17.701 --> 01:22:19.650
they publish them in these papers or journals.

2765
01:22:19.860 --> 01:22:22.440
These journals are often hidden behind paywalls.

2766
01:22:22.500 --> 01:22:23.160
Yes.

2767
01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:23.970
So the,

2768
01:22:23.970 --> 01:22:24.201
the,

2769
01:22:24.201 --> 01:22:24.451
the,

2770
01:22:24.451 --> 01:22:24.661
the,

2771
01:22:24.661 --> 01:22:28.980
the very people that paid to fund these studies don't really have access to

2772
01:22:28.981 --> 01:22:29.610
them.

2773
01:22:29.610 --> 01:22:33.660
And there was a kid who could went to juvenile [inaudible] into um,

2774
01:22:33.690 --> 01:22:34.051
yes,

2775
01:22:34.051 --> 01:22:35.240
he killed diversity.

2776
01:22:35.970 --> 01:22:36.450
He,

2777
01:22:36.450 --> 01:22:36.811
they were,

2778
01:22:36.811 --> 01:22:37.081
yeah,

2779
01:22:37.081 --> 01:22:39.690
they were charging him with like some serious crime.

2780
01:22:40.500 --> 01:22:41.670
Is that Aaron Schwartz?

2781
01:22:41.910 --> 01:22:42.810
I think it was Aaron Schwartz.

2782
01:22:42.811 --> 01:22:43.590
Yeah.

2783
01:22:43.590 --> 01:22:44.430
That was easy.

2784
01:22:45.260 --> 01:22:45.600
Yeah.

2785
01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:50.600
He hacked into all these sort of academic papers that were not made public.

2786
01:22:51.230 --> 01:22:51.460
You know,

2787
01:22:51.460 --> 01:22:52.650
he made them pay for them.

2788
01:22:52.651 --> 01:22:52.861
They were,

2789
01:22:52.861 --> 01:22:53.401
they were put on,

2790
01:22:53.401 --> 01:22:53.611
you know,

2791
01:22:53.611 --> 01:22:56.970
you had to pay for many act and made in public without the professors

2792
01:22:56.971 --> 01:22:57.930
intellectual property.

2793
01:22:57.931 --> 01:22:58.320
They,

2794
01:22:58.320 --> 01:22:59.550
that's their intellectual property.

2795
01:22:59.551 --> 01:23:04.380
They didn't give a say so the university makes money off of it and he just gave

2796
01:23:04.381 --> 01:23:06.340
them to everybody and then they threatened

2797
01:23:06.340 --> 01:23:07.450
<v 1>him to make an example in the,</v>

2798
01:23:07.451 --> 01:23:08.320
ended up killing himself.

2799
01:23:08.910 --> 01:23:09.510
Um,

2800
01:23:09.510 --> 01:23:10.690
how do you feel about that?

2801
01:23:10.691 --> 01:23:12.190
That seems here more than a year.

2802
01:23:12.191 --> 01:23:15.400
I've just Swartz killed himself rather than face prosecution's questions about

2803
01:23:15.401 --> 01:23:17.620
Mit's handling of the case persist.

2804
01:23:17.640 --> 01:23:18.400
Yeah,

2805
01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:19.233
scroll down.

2806
01:23:19.300 --> 01:23:20.590
I feel as though,

2807
01:23:20.591 --> 01:23:21.910
I think Erin Schwartz,

2808
01:23:22.340 --> 01:23:22.850
what you,

2809
01:23:22.850 --> 01:23:23.560
you know,

2810
01:23:23.560 --> 01:23:24.460
if you,

2811
01:23:24.490 --> 01:23:25.450
if you have,

2812
01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:25.960
um,

2813
01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:27.580
if somebody has intellectual property,

2814
01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:32.020
it's an academic paper on something and they can make money off it,

2815
01:23:32.021 --> 01:23:34.390
they should be allowed to make money off it and it fits your property and

2816
01:23:34.391 --> 01:23:38.050
somebody comes in and breaks into your password and just gives it away for free.

2817
01:23:38.460 --> 01:23:38.990
That's,

2818
01:23:38.990 --> 01:23:39.823
that's not cool.

2819
01:23:39.950 --> 01:23:40.450
Right.

2820
01:23:40.450 --> 01:23:41.530
I think that's what he did.

2821
01:23:41.531 --> 01:23:42.340
I don't know.

2822
01:23:42.340 --> 01:23:43.000
I just,

2823
01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:48.000
but if you are a public scientist and if you are working for a university that

2824
01:23:48.521 --> 01:23:52.750
receives tax dollars from the community and you do this work,

2825
01:23:52.990 --> 01:23:55.150
doesn't that work belong to everyone?

2826
01:23:55.180 --> 01:23:55.841
Very good question.

2827
01:23:55.841 --> 01:23:56.980
Everyone paid for it.

2828
01:23:57.010 --> 01:23:57.843
If they're not,

2829
01:23:57.850 --> 01:23:59.140
how are you public?

2830
01:23:59.170 --> 01:24:00.003
If you are,

2831
01:24:00.130 --> 01:24:04.570
you're getting money and you're earning money from the money that was put up by

2832
01:24:04.571 --> 01:24:05.980
the public to pay for you.

2833
01:24:05.981 --> 01:24:09.370
I mean you have to kind of define 100% we allow what we don't allow.

2834
01:24:09.610 --> 01:24:12.100
So in some ways he probably had a really good point.

2835
01:24:12.250 --> 01:24:14.260
The way went after it was kind of theft.

2836
01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:17.050
I mean he invaded someone's property,

2837
01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:20.590
which is the university to whether or not it should be their property.

2838
01:24:20.710 --> 01:24:21.820
That's debatable.

2839
01:24:21.940 --> 01:24:22.773
But the fact that he,

2840
01:24:22.870 --> 01:24:25.930
he wasn't allowed into their servers and he got in there,

2841
01:24:26.050 --> 01:24:27.700
all he did was download some stuff.

2842
01:24:27.701 --> 01:24:28.810
So it's not malicious.

2843
01:24:29.020 --> 01:24:33.310
I think whatever crime they should have a pointed at him would have been like

2844
01:24:33.311 --> 01:24:34.144
nothing.

2845
01:24:34.210 --> 01:24:35.021
Like a fine.

2846
01:24:35.021 --> 01:24:35.441
Maybe say,

2847
01:24:35.441 --> 01:24:35.771
hey man,

2848
01:24:35.771 --> 01:24:37.390
you can't just break into peoples,

2849
01:24:37.570 --> 01:24:38.950
can't just hack into people's servers.

2850
01:24:38.950 --> 01:24:39.850
That is fucked up.

2851
01:24:40.090 --> 01:24:42.100
So he should get some sort of fine for that.

2852
01:24:42.430 --> 01:24:46.600
But the idea of jail time mean I'm talking about like a $500 fine or $1,000 or

2853
01:24:46.601 --> 01:24:48.610
something like that and put him on probation.

2854
01:24:48.611 --> 01:24:49.600
So you don't ever do this again,

2855
01:24:49.601 --> 01:24:49.811
man.

2856
01:24:49.811 --> 01:24:51.730
You can't can't hack into people's.

2857
01:24:51.850 --> 01:24:55.210
But the idea that this guy was under so much stress that he killed himself over

2858
01:24:55.211 --> 01:24:56.770
releasing academic papers,

2859
01:24:56.771 --> 01:24:59.050
which clearly there's no malice involved.

2860
01:24:59.051 --> 01:25:00.130
We're not trying to hurt anybody,

2861
01:25:00.131 --> 01:25:01.690
threaten him with I think life in prison.

2862
01:25:01.691 --> 01:25:03.090
I mean they threatened her,

2863
01:25:03.091 --> 01:25:06.940
something terrible and he's trying to release things that make people smarter.

2864
01:25:07.330 --> 01:25:07.631
You know,

2865
01:25:07.631 --> 01:25:11.230
he's trying to put more of that out there and then you do the math and you go,

2866
01:25:11.231 --> 01:25:12.490
well how did this stuff get funded?

2867
01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:14.070
Did it get funded by taxpayers?

2868
01:25:14.071 --> 01:25:15.550
So why the fuck do we have to pay for it?

2869
01:25:15.910 --> 01:25:18.850
Why don't have to pay for the results of these pubs studies?

2870
01:25:18.870 --> 01:25:19.380
Yeah.

2871
01:25:19.380 --> 01:25:21.050
Pub Med studies or whatever the fuck they know.

2872
01:25:21.790 --> 01:25:25.470
If somebody publishes something in a paper and it was funded by taxpayers,

2873
01:25:25.480 --> 01:25:26.300
should be available,

2874
01:25:26.300 --> 01:25:27.970
should be in a public library somewhere.

2875
01:25:28.300 --> 01:25:31.330
What it is this guy talk about as far as GMO is,

2876
01:25:31.331 --> 01:25:32.830
I mean there's a lot of misinformation out there,

2877
01:25:32.831 --> 01:25:33.190
right?

2878
01:25:33.190 --> 01:25:33.491
Yeah.

2879
01:25:33.491 --> 01:25:34.340
He was expensive,

2880
01:25:34.350 --> 01:25:35.051
so long,

2881
01:25:35.051 --> 01:25:36.070
long podcasts.

2882
01:25:36.071 --> 01:25:38.110
We did three full hours and he was great.

2883
01:25:38.470 --> 01:25:41.410
He's a really a really interesting guy and man,

2884
01:25:41.411 --> 01:25:44.860
people have some crazy misconceptions and they stick to them like glue.

2885
01:25:45.190 --> 01:25:47.890
No matter what he said on the podcast and what he explained in the podcast.

2886
01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:51.450
You see people arguing with it online or religious,

2887
01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:52.360
their religion,

2888
01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:53.550
a lot of list about it.

2889
01:25:53.551 --> 01:25:53.920
Yeah.

2890
01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:57.700
They don't understand what it means to modify these foods,

2891
01:25:57.701 --> 01:25:59.470
like these ideas of Frankenfoods,

2892
01:25:59.471 --> 01:26:01.750
these ideas of what's dangerous and deadly.

2893
01:26:01.900 --> 01:26:03.710
It's something that people have been doing forever.

2894
01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:06.980
They just been doing it and he was explaining how they were splicing plants

2895
01:26:06.981 --> 01:26:10.760
together and creating hybrids of plants and that they would take,

2896
01:26:10.761 --> 01:26:10.900
you know,

2897
01:26:10.900 --> 01:26:11.733
the cars.

2898
01:26:11.780 --> 01:26:14.150
Sometimes they require less pesticides,

2899
01:26:14.180 --> 01:26:15.500
but he's so he's saying when he's talking about it,

2900
01:26:15.501 --> 01:26:16.490
this has been done forever.

2901
01:26:16.510 --> 01:26:16.940
Yeah.

2902
01:26:16.940 --> 01:26:20.240
And it's like the difference being that now their engineering,

2903
01:26:20.241 --> 01:26:23.330
certain things to turn on genes or turn off genes are,

2904
01:26:23.660 --> 01:26:26.510
and people are concerned that this could be really dangerous.

2905
01:26:26.690 --> 01:26:29.210
And he was really honest about it,

2906
01:26:29.211 --> 01:26:29.780
man.

2907
01:26:29.780 --> 01:26:30.261
He's like,

2908
01:26:30.261 --> 01:26:30.580
yes.

2909
01:26:30.580 --> 01:26:31.400
I'm like,

2910
01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:33.050
she just should be some concern.

2911
01:26:33.410 --> 01:26:36.320
And he was really honest about the whole idea of we yell,

2912
01:26:36.321 --> 01:26:40.220
we don't exactly know that this is going to be safe for everybody at every

2913
01:26:40.221 --> 01:26:41.540
single turn every time.

2914
01:26:41.870 --> 01:26:44.600
But if you just look at the things we were going over,

2915
01:26:44.601 --> 01:26:46.370
the things that kill people right now,

2916
01:26:46.730 --> 01:26:51.730
like peanuts and Brian has a fucking a allergy to penicillin.

2917
01:26:51.980 --> 01:26:52.880
And My mother does too.

2918
01:26:52.881 --> 01:26:54.040
She'll die if my mother,

2919
01:26:54.500 --> 01:26:55.340
my mother eats one,

2920
01:26:55.341 --> 01:26:56.174
Brazil nut,

2921
01:26:56.240 --> 01:26:57.110
one shall die.

2922
01:26:57.500 --> 01:26:58.333
That's crazy.

2923
01:26:58.370 --> 01:26:59.450
So think of that.

2924
01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:01.370
Just imagine if that was a drug,

2925
01:27:01.730 --> 01:27:04.220
if that was a drug that was released by the pharmaceutical company,

2926
01:27:04.221 --> 01:27:05.540
would those numbers be tolerated?

2927
01:27:06.350 --> 01:27:06.710
Boy,

2928
01:27:06.710 --> 01:27:07.543
I don't think so.

2929
01:27:07.670 --> 01:27:08.450
I don't think so.

2930
01:27:08.450 --> 01:27:11.840
So if it's a common atory plant or vegetable,

2931
01:27:11.841 --> 01:27:16.730
something that they've created and it wax out one person out of 100 million,

2932
01:27:16.910 --> 01:27:17.870
should that be okay?

2933
01:27:17.900 --> 01:27:19.070
I don't think it should,

2934
01:27:19.071 --> 01:27:20.240
but man,

2935
01:27:20.241 --> 01:27:21.051
that's a tough cost.

2936
01:27:21.051 --> 01:27:22.700
It's a tough that we meet this calls all the time.

2937
01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:24.380
Asks Kills Aspirin.

2938
01:27:24.381 --> 01:27:25.490
Kills a number of people.

2939
01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:26.560
Thousands of people out here.

2940
01:27:26.561 --> 01:27:27.020
Yeah.

2941
01:27:27.020 --> 01:27:27.351
Now you're,

2942
01:27:27.351 --> 01:27:29.150
nobody in their right mind is going to ban aspirin.

2943
01:27:29.151 --> 01:27:31.970
It's a great drug and helps a lot of people with chronic pain.

2944
01:27:32.030 --> 01:27:36.970
Did a lot of people drink too much water and die from that every year like

2945
01:27:36.980 --> 01:27:41.980
anything is is that's queen is toxic in a certain quantities.

2946
01:27:42.470 --> 01:27:43.303
That's a fact.

2947
01:27:43.310 --> 01:27:47.990
But the thing about this is that people are worried about cancer because they're

2948
01:27:47.991 --> 01:27:52.100
worried about what they're doing to these plants are not natural and that's how

2949
01:27:52.101 --> 01:27:56.090
they're able to fight off these pesticides and it's a legitimate concern when

2950
01:27:56.091 --> 01:27:59.930
you look into what's actually going on and actually being done.

2951
01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:03.470
I think most of the plants that were worried about when it comes to that stuff,

2952
01:28:03.471 --> 01:28:06.920
I think those are the ones that they feed to animals and then you're worried

2953
01:28:06.921 --> 01:28:07.101
about,

2954
01:28:07.101 --> 01:28:07.311
okay,

2955
01:28:07.311 --> 01:28:10.970
now you're eating the animal that's eating this stuff that has this roundup shit

2956
01:28:10.971 --> 01:28:11.660
on it.

2957
01:28:11.660 --> 01:28:12.530
Like what is,

2958
01:28:12.890 --> 01:28:13.640
what's that?

2959
01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:15.220
What's going on there cause like,

2960
01:28:15.520 --> 01:28:18.380
like we were talking about bears like if you eat a bear that's been eating

2961
01:28:18.381 --> 01:28:19.041
blueberries,

2962
01:28:19.041 --> 01:28:21.590
it's supposed to be like the most delicious meat in the world.

2963
01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:23.240
Steve Rinella talks about this.

2964
01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:28.130
He had a an episode where he shot this bear in Alaska and as he's butchering the

2965
01:28:28.131 --> 01:28:28.790
bear,

2966
01:28:28.790 --> 01:28:30.500
the bear fat has blue.

2967
01:28:30.650 --> 01:28:31.850
It's a blue hue,

2968
01:28:31.851 --> 01:28:35.360
like almost a purple hue because of the blueberries is things have been eating

2969
01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:36.591
well.

2970
01:28:36.591 --> 01:28:41.591
Who's to say that if you're giving a fucking cow or you're giving a some

2971
01:28:42.620 --> 01:28:43.610
whatever animal,

2972
01:28:43.850 --> 01:28:46.430
some this roundup shit.

2973
01:28:46.670 --> 01:28:47.503
If it's in,

2974
01:28:47.510 --> 01:28:51.740
if you're spraying it on vegetables to kill bugs and then those vegetables get

2975
01:28:51.741 --> 01:28:52.161
fed,

2976
01:28:52.161 --> 01:28:54.500
are you washing them before you give them your cows?

2977
01:28:54.501 --> 01:28:57.230
Like how exactly you treating them and make sure there's nothing in there.

2978
01:28:57.231 --> 01:28:58.400
If there is something in there,

2979
01:28:58.580 --> 01:29:01.230
just like how the blueberry makes the bear tastes different,

2980
01:29:01.770 --> 01:29:02.010
that's

2981
01:29:02.010 --> 01:29:04.800
<v 0>got to do something to what you're eating.</v>

2982
01:29:04.830 --> 01:29:05.820
It's just gotten too,

2983
01:29:06.030 --> 01:29:09.030
it just got to be affecting the flesh that you're taking into your body.

2984
01:29:09.930 --> 01:29:11.070
And there's a potential,

2985
01:29:11.071 --> 01:29:12.960
if you're eating toxic shit,

2986
01:29:13.140 --> 01:29:14.720
if that is like the,

2987
01:29:14.721 --> 01:29:15.060
the,

2988
01:29:15.060 --> 01:29:20.060
that cow is eating some pesticides that's gotta be able to get into the meat.

2989
01:29:20.940 --> 01:29:22.710
So maybe they'll yoga lady was right.

2990
01:29:23.550 --> 01:29:24.360
Wayne,

2991
01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:26.190
Mandy toxic mag.

2992
01:29:26.550 --> 01:29:27.061
I mean look,

2993
01:29:27.061 --> 01:29:28.290
if you look at it that way,

2994
01:29:28.350 --> 01:29:30.270
she got kind of almost has a point.

2995
01:29:30.750 --> 01:29:34.710
If you're not getting like free range grass fed roundup,

2996
01:29:34.711 --> 01:29:35.431
is that bad?

2997
01:29:35.431 --> 01:29:36.720
If indeed it does get in the meat,

2998
01:29:36.721 --> 01:29:37.554
if indeed it does.

2999
01:29:37.590 --> 01:29:38.250
What kits,

3000
01:29:38.250 --> 01:29:40.140
quantity to a quantity that affects you?

3001
01:29:40.141 --> 01:29:40.291
We,

3002
01:29:40.291 --> 01:29:41.124
I don't know.

3003
01:29:41.160 --> 01:29:42.510
Did you ever see the um,

3004
01:29:42.750 --> 01:29:43.380
there was uh,

3005
01:29:43.380 --> 01:29:44.213
uh,

3006
01:29:44.250 --> 01:29:48.890
one of these shows where this guy had offered to drink round up.

3007
01:29:49.260 --> 01:29:50.850
He had said is totally safe.

3008
01:29:50.880 --> 01:29:52.020
You don't have to worry about it.

3009
01:29:52.230 --> 01:29:52.501
He goes,

3010
01:29:52.501 --> 01:29:53.280
I would drink it.

3011
01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:54.330
And the guy who is he drinking?

3012
01:29:54.360 --> 01:29:54.511
Yeah.

3013
01:29:54.511 --> 01:29:55.500
Well I've got a glass here,

3014
01:29:55.501 --> 01:29:56.280
drink it.

3015
01:29:56.280 --> 01:29:56.821
And the guy goes,

3016
01:29:56.821 --> 01:29:58.350
well you're just being a total jerk.

3017
01:29:58.510 --> 01:29:59.343
And he leaves.

3018
01:29:59.850 --> 01:30:00.140
He said,

3019
01:30:00.140 --> 01:30:00.810
watch it.

3020
01:30:00.810 --> 01:30:01.870
Cause it's hilarious.

3021
01:30:01.970 --> 01:30:02.910
I did drink.

3022
01:30:02.911 --> 01:30:03.810
I don't know if it was round.

3023
01:30:03.811 --> 01:30:04.470
Watch this.

3024
01:30:04.470 --> 01:30:04.801
Let's,

3025
01:30:04.801 --> 01:30:05.370
let's hold up.

3026
01:30:05.370 --> 01:30:08.670
Just start it from the beginning and give us a volume cause this is wonderful.

3027
01:30:09.280 --> 01:30:10.113
I love this,

3028
01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:11.153
but he's leave

3029
01:30:11.300 --> 01:30:15.080
<v 3>that glyphosate in Argentina is causing increases in cancer.</v>

3030
01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:17.770
You can drink a whole quart of it and it won't hurt you.

3031
01:30:18.160 --> 01:30:19.520
It's to drink some.

3032
01:30:19.521 --> 01:30:20.330
We have some here.

3033
01:30:20.330 --> 01:30:21.111
I'd be happy to.

3034
01:30:21.111 --> 01:30:21.944
Actually,

3035
01:30:21.960 --> 01:30:22.340
not.

3036
01:30:22.340 --> 01:30:22.881
Not really,

3037
01:30:22.881 --> 01:30:24.920
but I know it wouldn't hurt me.

3038
01:30:26.530 --> 01:30:27.470
I have some guns.

3039
01:30:27.471 --> 01:30:28.340
I'm not stupid,

3040
01:30:29.300 --> 01:30:31.350
but I know that's dangerous.

3041
01:30:31.740 --> 01:30:32.030
No.

3042
01:30:32.030 --> 01:30:35.180
People tried to commit suicide that it would fail fairly regularly.

3043
01:30:35.510 --> 01:30:36.141
Tell the truth.

3044
01:30:36.141 --> 01:30:37.640
It's dangerous to humans.

3045
01:30:37.700 --> 01:30:38.060
No,

3046
01:30:38.060 --> 01:30:38.580
it's not.

3047
01:30:38.580 --> 01:30:40.340
So are you ready to drink when I'm in class,

3048
01:30:40.970 --> 01:30:41.803
I'm not an idiot.

3049
01:30:42.530 --> 01:30:44.210
Interview me about Golden Rice.

3050
01:30:44.211 --> 01:30:45.350
That's what I'm talking about.

3051
01:30:45.590 --> 01:30:45.921
Okay,

3052
01:30:45.921 --> 01:30:46.754
then it's finished.

3053
01:30:47.090 --> 01:30:50.540
Then the interview is finished and say that's a good way to sell things

3054
01:30:52.050 --> 01:30:52.883
here.

3055
01:30:55.360 --> 01:30:56.130
<v 0>Come on man.</v>

3056
01:30:56.130 --> 01:30:57.500
You're a complete jerk.

3057
01:30:57.501 --> 01:30:58.430
He got mad quickly,

3058
01:30:58.431 --> 01:30:58.821
didn't it?

3059
01:30:58.821 --> 01:30:59.151
Yeah,

3060
01:30:59.151 --> 01:30:59.810
of course he did.

3061
01:30:59.810 --> 01:31:00.411
You dare me.

3062
01:31:00.411 --> 01:31:03.200
I'm going to have to probably drink it while on there.

3063
01:31:03.230 --> 01:31:04.063
He's a liar.

3064
01:31:04.430 --> 01:31:05.830
The guy who they were,

3065
01:31:05.970 --> 01:31:06.320
they were,

3066
01:31:06.320 --> 01:31:07.430
they were spraying the trees.

3067
01:31:07.431 --> 01:31:07.550
I,

3068
01:31:07.550 --> 01:31:08.383
it was California,

3069
01:31:08.630 --> 01:31:10.940
the orange trees for fruit flies or whatever.

3070
01:31:11.420 --> 01:31:13.040
And he started the meeting.

3071
01:31:13.500 --> 01:31:13.730
Uh,

3072
01:31:13.730 --> 01:31:14.790
he was the owner of the company.

3073
01:31:14.791 --> 01:31:16.940
He started the meeting by drinking an entire glass of it.

3074
01:31:17.210 --> 01:31:18.020
Oh my God.

3075
01:31:18.020 --> 01:31:18.350
Yeah.

3076
01:31:18.350 --> 01:31:19.160
And carried on.

3077
01:31:19.160 --> 01:31:19.550
He goes,

3078
01:31:19.550 --> 01:31:20.840
so here's how dangerous it is.

3079
01:31:20.841 --> 01:31:21.674
Ready guys,

3080
01:31:21.770 --> 01:31:22.360
go cluck,

3081
01:31:22.360 --> 01:31:22.601
cluck,

3082
01:31:22.601 --> 01:31:22.871
cluck,

3083
01:31:22.871 --> 01:31:23.141
cluck,

3084
01:31:23.141 --> 01:31:24.320
and it's doesn't taste good or whatever.

3085
01:31:24.321 --> 01:31:25.040
Boom.

3086
01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:28.190
And that was a famous way started that sort of like to prove to everybody that

3087
01:31:28.460 --> 01:31:30.740
this product is not toxic.

3088
01:31:30.920 --> 01:31:31.460
Okay.

3089
01:31:31.460 --> 01:31:32.930
But then how's it killed bugs?

3090
01:31:33.620 --> 01:31:33.861
Well,

3091
01:31:33.861 --> 01:31:34.521
I think bugs,

3092
01:31:34.521 --> 01:31:35.151
I don't know,

3093
01:31:35.151 --> 01:31:35.361
but I,

3094
01:31:35.361 --> 01:31:36.390
I do know that a town,

3095
01:31:36.560 --> 01:31:40.100
usually it will attack the bugs central nervous system or something or causes

3096
01:31:40.250 --> 01:31:40.641
some,

3097
01:31:40.641 --> 01:31:42.170
it fucks with one enzyme.

3098
01:31:42.230 --> 01:31:43.430
I would like to talk to you today.

3099
01:31:43.431 --> 01:31:44.720
What if he's turning into the flaw?

3100
01:31:44.780 --> 01:31:45.510
Exactly.

3101
01:31:45.510 --> 01:31:48.200
She just got really thick hair and he's strong as shit.

3102
01:31:48.440 --> 01:31:49.170
It just gets,

3103
01:31:49.170 --> 01:31:53.690
and he throws up stuff on his food and start fucks all the time.

3104
01:31:54.040 --> 01:31:54.950
Jeff Goldbloom was just,

3105
01:31:55.060 --> 01:31:56.800

3106
01:31:57.290 --> 01:31:58.101
great movie.

3107
01:31:58.101 --> 01:31:59.030
It's a great God damn movie.

3108
01:31:59.150 --> 01:32:01.510
Goldblum is about seven eight.

3109
01:32:01.540 --> 01:32:02.840
He's a giant fan.

3110
01:32:02.850 --> 01:32:03.431
Huge.

3111
01:32:03.431 --> 01:32:04.360
Fucking huge.

3112
01:32:04.420 --> 01:32:05.470
He's so talented,

3113
01:32:05.471 --> 01:32:05.740
man.

3114
01:32:05.740 --> 01:32:06.311
I love him.

3115
01:32:06.311 --> 01:32:10.060
And Jurassic Park and impossible Dick.

3116
01:32:10.150 --> 01:32:10.600
Whoa.

3117
01:32:10.600 --> 01:32:12.790
He's got an in possible dick on them.

3118
01:32:12.820 --> 01:32:15.110
How big I hear it's so,

3119
01:32:15.190 --> 01:32:15.790
first of all,

3120
01:32:15.790 --> 01:32:17.350
there are two things that he has going for him.

3121
01:32:17.380 --> 01:32:21.640
And I know girl dated him and I dated her for about 10 minutes and she said,

3122
01:32:21.641 --> 01:32:21.941
well,

3123
01:32:21.941 --> 01:32:23.860
he plays the piano concert piano.

3124
01:32:23.861 --> 01:32:24.031
He's a,

3125
01:32:24.031 --> 01:32:25.000
he's a concert pianist,

3126
01:32:25.001 --> 01:32:25.810
basically,

3127
01:32:25.810 --> 01:32:28.030
and he's got a donkey dick.

3128
01:32:28.750 --> 01:32:29.260
And I thought,

3129
01:32:29.260 --> 01:32:29.531
I said,

3130
01:32:29.531 --> 01:32:29.951
of course.

3131
01:32:29.951 --> 01:32:30.270
I went,

3132
01:32:30.270 --> 01:32:30.450
Whoa,

3133
01:32:30.450 --> 01:32:30.940
hold on.

3134
01:32:30.940 --> 01:32:31.780
I stop everything.

3135
01:32:31.781 --> 01:32:32.614
Fuck his piano.

3136
01:32:32.740 --> 01:32:33.250
Let's get it.

3137
01:32:33.250 --> 01:32:34.480
Let's get to his dick immediately,

3138
01:32:34.510 --> 01:32:35.090
immediately.

3139
01:32:35.090 --> 01:32:35.860
And I had to,

3140
01:32:35.860 --> 01:32:36.760
I had to ask her and she,

3141
01:32:36.761 --> 01:32:37.990
she showed me her forearm.

3142
01:32:37.991 --> 01:32:38.381
She said,

3143
01:32:38.381 --> 01:32:39.490
it's as big as my forum.

3144
01:32:39.670 --> 01:32:40.250
Whoa.

3145
01:32:40.250 --> 01:32:41.300
And Monster Hall.

3146
01:32:41.310 --> 01:32:41.710
And I said,

3147
01:32:41.710 --> 01:32:42.580
and of course then I said,

3148
01:32:42.581 --> 01:32:42.791
you,

3149
01:32:42.791 --> 01:32:43.624
you slut.

3150
01:32:44.680 --> 01:32:45.513
How dare you?

3151
01:32:45.700 --> 01:32:46.361
I said,

3152
01:32:46.361 --> 01:32:47.230
who's better than dead?

3153
01:32:47.231 --> 01:32:47.561
And she goes,

3154
01:32:47.561 --> 01:32:48.640
I'm not going to talk about that.

3155
01:32:48.700 --> 01:32:49.030
Well,

3156
01:32:49.030 --> 01:32:49.900
you lost there.

3157
01:32:49.901 --> 01:32:54.901
I definitely lost to the six foot six talking tick piano playing richest shit

3158
01:32:55.330 --> 01:32:56.350
successful as fuck.

3159
01:32:56.410 --> 01:32:57.820
If you watch that movie the fly,

3160
01:32:57.830 --> 01:32:59.470
you'll get an idea of how he fucks too.

3161
01:32:59.590 --> 01:33:00.423
Yeah.

3162
01:33:00.460 --> 01:33:00.671
Yeah.

3163
01:33:00.671 --> 01:33:01.070
He's kind of,

3164
01:33:01.070 --> 01:33:01.361
he's a,

3165
01:33:01.361 --> 01:33:02.194
he's a stud.

3166
01:33:02.410 --> 01:33:03.970
He's got an easy bone structure,

3167
01:33:04.870 --> 01:33:08.520
so I love him in Jurassic Park is one of my all time favorite roles are his,

3168
01:33:08.530 --> 01:33:09.363
he's just great.

3169
01:33:09.910 --> 01:33:10.091
Yeah,

3170
01:33:10.091 --> 01:33:10.910
he's an interesting,

3171
01:33:10.910 --> 01:33:11.170
he just,

3172
01:33:11.170 --> 01:33:12.820
he wasn't a region of the body snatchers.

3173
01:33:13.060 --> 01:33:13.301
Yes,

3174
01:33:13.301 --> 01:33:14.100
I do know that.

3175
01:33:14.100 --> 01:33:14.390
You know,

3176
01:33:14.390 --> 01:33:14.760
I was uh,

3177
01:33:14.760 --> 01:33:15.311
it was amazing.

3178
01:33:15.311 --> 01:33:15.561
It was like,

3179
01:33:15.561 --> 01:33:15.711
God,

3180
01:33:15.711 --> 01:33:16.511
what is he like 20.

3181
01:33:16.511 --> 01:33:18.760
He also had a very tiny part in Annie Hall.

3182
01:33:19.320 --> 01:33:19.720
Ah,

3183
01:33:19.720 --> 01:33:20.080
Yup.

3184
01:33:20.080 --> 01:33:22.710
He was an almost an extra and uh,

3185
01:33:23.150 --> 01:33:24.190
got us unique.

3186
01:33:24.250 --> 01:33:24.431
Yeah.

3187
01:33:24.431 --> 01:33:25.450
He's a bad motherfucker.

3188
01:33:25.480 --> 01:33:28.990
He's great as a scientist too because as a scientist he has like all these

3189
01:33:28.991 --> 01:33:32.470
unique quirks about the way he describes things and processes,

3190
01:33:32.471 --> 01:33:36.760
things you totally believe he's intelligent enough to be making like in the fly.

3191
01:33:36.761 --> 01:33:37.840
It's a perfect example.

3192
01:33:38.170 --> 01:33:41.050
Could you imagine like a dull actor playing that role?

3193
01:33:41.080 --> 01:33:41.830
Like what he's,

3194
01:33:41.830 --> 01:33:42.200
what he's,

3195
01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:44.740
when he's pitching it and he's passionate about it,

3196
01:33:44.741 --> 01:33:46.240
like that excitement,

3197
01:33:46.241 --> 01:33:47.500
like you really believe it,

3198
01:33:47.501 --> 01:33:48.020
you will business.

3199
01:33:48.020 --> 01:33:48.140
Oh,

3200
01:33:48.140 --> 01:33:49.180
he's the guy who created that,

3201
01:33:49.260 --> 01:33:50.140
that transporter.

3202
01:33:50.200 --> 01:33:50.580
This also,

3203
01:33:50.580 --> 01:33:53.230
that kind of a thing he does is tiny.

3204
01:33:53.240 --> 01:33:53.471
He's on,

3205
01:33:53.471 --> 01:33:55.720
I was thinking about it as he talks about it.

3206
01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:59.140
I just wear the same clothing all the time and pick it up from last time because

3207
01:33:59.141 --> 01:33:59.201
I,

3208
01:33:59.201 --> 01:34:00.190
the way I don't have to think about,

3209
01:34:01.780 --> 01:34:03.170
but I believe that we do.

3210
01:34:03.220 --> 01:34:04.540
I'm saying he's,

3211
01:34:04.630 --> 01:34:06.380
he's one of those guys were,

3212
01:34:06.390 --> 01:34:08.350
while he's doing it on stage or in a,

3213
01:34:08.351 --> 01:34:09.184
in a,

3214
01:34:09.190 --> 01:34:09.491
you know,

3215
01:34:09.491 --> 01:34:10.660
on the movie you,

3216
01:34:10.710 --> 01:34:13.720
you really believe you will forget that it's Jeff Goldblum.

3217
01:34:13.930 --> 01:34:15.190
Even for brief moments,

3218
01:34:15.191 --> 01:34:18.340
like he's good enough that it just hypnotizes you and then you're like,

3219
01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:18.641
wow,

3220
01:34:18.641 --> 01:34:19.990
he can fucking kicked ass in that one.

3221
01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:20.833
Yeah.

3222
01:34:20.980 --> 01:34:23.980
There's only a few of those people out there we'll walk in is probably that way

3223
01:34:23.981 --> 01:34:24.190
too.

3224
01:34:24.190 --> 01:34:25.510
Just like,

3225
01:34:25.820 --> 01:34:26.351
I know that's a,

3226
01:34:26.351 --> 01:34:27.700
that's a name from the past.

3227
01:34:27.820 --> 01:34:31.320
Very Donald when they Dunaway Chinatown Watch Chinatown with chocolate.

3228
01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:32.710
So God damn,

3229
01:34:32.711 --> 01:34:35.470
she could act phenomenal movies as Christ.

3230
01:34:35.471 --> 01:34:36.304
She was good.

3231
01:34:36.490 --> 01:34:37.720
So it was heat too much.

3232
01:34:37.721 --> 01:34:38.411
Jesus Christ.

3233
01:34:38.411 --> 01:34:39.244
That's a good movie.

3234
01:34:39.340 --> 01:34:40.240
What's his name in the movie,

3235
01:34:40.241 --> 01:34:41.020
Hank or something?

3236
01:34:41.020 --> 01:34:41.680
I don't remember.

3237
01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:42.101
I forget it.

3238
01:34:42.101 --> 01:34:42.371
Hank.

3239
01:34:42.371 --> 01:34:43.204
It's Chinatown.

3240
01:34:43.510 --> 01:34:44.343
Fuck.

3241
01:34:44.770 --> 01:34:45.600
She's my mother.

3242
01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:45.790
No,

3243
01:34:45.790 --> 01:34:46.623
she's my daughter.

3244
01:34:47.020 --> 01:34:47.860
She's my sister.

3245
01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:49.113
She's my daughter.

3246
01:34:49.240 --> 01:34:49.841
She's my sister.

3247
01:34:49.841 --> 01:34:50.620
I remember that.

3248
01:34:50.620 --> 01:34:51.700
Or He's slapping her face.

3249
01:34:53.020 --> 01:34:54.550
John cut his nose.

3250
01:34:55.150 --> 01:34:57.860
Sliced his nose for for 10 points.

3251
01:34:57.861 --> 01:34:58.070
You know

3252
01:34:58.070 --> 01:34:59.240
<v 1>who actually cut his nose?</v>

3253
01:34:59.360 --> 01:34:59.930
No,

3254
01:34:59.930 --> 01:35:00.980
that was Roman Polanski.

3255
01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:01.521
Really?

3256
01:35:01.521 --> 01:35:02.354
That was the director.

3257
01:35:02.420 --> 01:35:03.253
Wow.

3258
01:35:03.620 --> 01:35:06.550
And then he had sex with a 13 year old and I had to go to France and he can

3259
01:35:06.551 --> 01:35:07.384
never come back

3260
01:35:08.730 --> 01:35:09.260
I think.

3261
01:35:09.260 --> 01:35:10.093
Yeah.

3262
01:35:10.310 --> 01:35:11.770
It didn't he drug or something to,

3263
01:35:12.340 --> 01:35:12.560
uh,

3264
01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:17.560
she was on drugs and she was high and he sodomized her as well in the Jacuzzi.

3265
01:35:17.660 --> 01:35:18.830
Did he drug her?

3266
01:35:18.890 --> 01:35:19.650
Did he know?

3267
01:35:19.650 --> 01:35:24.060
I think she was doing the drugs and she had had sex with somebody else and she'd

3268
01:35:24.110 --> 01:35:24.891
been there before,

3269
01:35:24.891 --> 01:35:26.180
but she's 13.

3270
01:35:26.181 --> 01:35:29.810
I had an argument with a bunch of fans of his and I said,

3271
01:35:29.930 --> 01:35:30.763
look,

3272
01:35:31.130 --> 01:35:31.791
it's fine.

3273
01:35:31.791 --> 01:35:35.180
I know that you're coming up with reasons why he could and he should be let back

3274
01:35:35.181 --> 01:35:36.014
in United States is fine.

3275
01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:37.520
If it was your daughter,

3276
01:35:37.610 --> 01:35:39.080
if it was your 13 year old,

3277
01:35:39.170 --> 01:35:42.500
13 just just how would you feel?

3278
01:35:42.680 --> 01:35:43.610
That's not the point.

3279
01:35:43.900 --> 01:35:44.571
It is the point.

3280
01:35:44.571 --> 01:35:44.810
Oh,

3281
01:35:44.810 --> 01:35:45.231
how's that?

3282
01:35:45.231 --> 01:35:46.250
Not The point.

3283
01:35:46.370 --> 01:35:47.660
The point is like,

3284
01:35:47.780 --> 01:35:48.140
well,

3285
01:35:48.140 --> 01:35:50.600
the only thing that could be not the point is,

3286
01:35:50.601 --> 01:35:51.860
is he that same guy now?

3287
01:35:53.180 --> 01:35:57.560
Is He that same guy now or were you dealing with a guy who,

3288
01:35:57.590 --> 01:35:58.760
if many people don't know,

3289
01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:02.030
Roman Polanski terrible as he might be,

3290
01:36:02.650 --> 01:36:06.430
was suffered one of the most insane things that can ever happen to him.

3291
01:36:06.431 --> 01:36:07.191
But the Holocaust,

3292
01:36:07.191 --> 01:36:12.191
the Manson family killed his wife and cut his pregnant wife's belly open.

3293
01:36:13.021 --> 01:36:13.820
Yeah,

3294
01:36:13.820 --> 01:36:16.460
and smeared blood all over the wall.

3295
01:36:16.700 --> 01:36:17.240
I mean,

3296
01:36:17.240 --> 01:36:18.650
what would they did?

3297
01:36:19.460 --> 01:36:21.590
That was the Tate labianca murders.

3298
01:36:22.100 --> 01:36:25.360
Sharon Tate was Roman Polanski's wife access,

3299
01:36:25.380 --> 01:36:26.140
right.

3300
01:36:26.140 --> 01:36:28.130
It was his baby at the time.

3301
01:36:28.131 --> 01:36:29.120
And his wife at the time.

3302
01:36:29.121 --> 01:36:34.000
I mean that has got to be a mind breaker.

3303
01:36:34.380 --> 01:36:37.220
Now I'm not saying that that would resort someone to pedophilia,

3304
01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:43.240
but I mean who knows what was going on in that guy's mind or life at that point.

3305
01:36:45.110 --> 01:36:49.640
If he's not that guy anymore and that woman wherever she is,

3306
01:36:49.641 --> 01:36:50.630
if she's still alive,

3307
01:36:50.900 --> 01:36:51.800
forgives him.

3308
01:36:52.430 --> 01:36:55.610
I could see him being able to lead a normal life.

3309
01:36:55.640 --> 01:36:56.690
I mean there's been enough.

3310
01:36:56.720 --> 01:36:57.381
He was also,

3311
01:36:57.381 --> 01:36:59.660
I believe a concentration camp survivor,

3312
01:36:59.661 --> 01:37:03.860
or at least he had been in the Holocaust and Poland as a Jew and had to flee.

3313
01:37:03.890 --> 01:37:04.070
Yeah.

3314
01:37:04.070 --> 01:37:05.630
I think one of those too,

3315
01:37:05.690 --> 01:37:06.650
I remember as well.

3316
01:37:06.770 --> 01:37:07.700
So it's like,

3317
01:37:08.090 --> 01:37:08.331
look,

3318
01:37:08.331 --> 01:37:09.920
that guy's been through some horrific,

3319
01:37:09.921 --> 01:37:14.921
horrific shit and it's certainly doesn't justify or exonerate him rather from

3320
01:37:15.711 --> 01:37:17.930
anything terrible that he's done.

3321
01:37:18.410 --> 01:37:21.980
But at a certain point in time you've got to go like,

3322
01:37:21.981 --> 01:37:23.180
what should be,

3323
01:37:23.210 --> 01:37:25.790
what should be done about something that happened 25 years ago?

3324
01:37:25.791 --> 01:37:27.380
Should you have to do time in jail?

3325
01:37:28.100 --> 01:37:31.670
Has He escaped there as the statute of limitations for that very reason that to

3326
01:37:31.671 --> 01:37:33.150
answer that question and,

3327
01:37:33.151 --> 01:37:34.360
and the other one or the other.

3328
01:37:34.361 --> 01:37:35.194
Do you know what I'm saying?

3329
01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:35.990
Yeah.

3330
01:37:35.990 --> 01:37:39.050
Well that's why the statue of limitations exist because you are not thought to

3331
01:37:39.051 --> 01:37:39.980
be that person anymore.

3332
01:37:40.040 --> 01:37:41.540
I believe that's the,

3333
01:37:41.600 --> 01:37:43.400
the logic behind,

3334
01:37:43.550 --> 01:37:47.600
I believe that's at least the partial logic behind that law wasn't that one of

3335
01:37:47.601 --> 01:37:52.601
the crazy things about like contracts like contracts and leases and things along

3336
01:37:53.991 --> 01:37:54.471
those lines.

3337
01:37:54.471 --> 01:37:56.330
Like it's like a greeting

3338
01:37:56.340 --> 01:37:59.430
<v 0>that you're going to be the same person to a certain extent,</v>

3339
01:37:59.640 --> 01:38:04.640
like a marriage or death row committed a crime and he was 18 and now he's 45 and

3340
01:38:07.021 --> 01:38:09.450
is a very different person than I was when he was 18.

3341
01:38:09.730 --> 01:38:10.170
Uh,

3342
01:38:10.170 --> 01:38:11.250
that was,

3343
01:38:11.340 --> 01:38:11.640
um,

3344
01:38:11.640 --> 01:38:12.960
there are a lot of examples of that.

3345
01:38:13.500 --> 01:38:13.781
Well,

3346
01:38:13.781 --> 01:38:18.781
it's why are you expected to be responsible for things that you did 18 over but

3347
01:38:20.490 --> 01:38:23.820
under 18 you become a juvenile and you have like different,

3348
01:38:24.070 --> 01:38:24.990
it's physiological.

3349
01:38:24.991 --> 01:38:29.991
Actually the reason for that is that the frontal cortex of a teenager is not

3350
01:38:30.001 --> 01:38:30.840
fully developed,

3351
01:38:31.020 --> 01:38:34.020
and that's the area of your brand new use to make decisions.

3352
01:38:34.230 --> 01:38:35.430
And so teenagers,

3353
01:38:35.431 --> 01:38:37.080
biologically t from,

3354
01:38:37.110 --> 01:38:37.741
from what I understand,

3355
01:38:37.741 --> 01:38:39.060
it's more impulsive and all that.

3356
01:38:39.061 --> 01:38:39.900
Especially boys.

3357
01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:42.630
Teenage boys have the worst of that.

3358
01:38:42.631 --> 01:38:46.290
And they say until they're 25 like it doesn't even fully form.

3359
01:38:46.530 --> 01:38:48.930
Like that's why they said that if you want to get rid of all crimes,

3360
01:38:48.931 --> 01:38:50.490
just take all 14 year old boys,

3361
01:38:50.640 --> 01:38:53.660
take them 14 in the age of 21 put black men in prison jail,

3362
01:38:53.730 --> 01:38:54.870
never having a violent crime.

3363
01:38:54.940 --> 01:38:55.060
Well,

3364
01:38:55.060 --> 01:38:55.893
they had a,

3365
01:38:56.130 --> 01:38:59.280
they had a study about the amount of violent crimes that are committed by people

3366
01:38:59.281 --> 01:39:01.410
in that age range and it's overwhelming.

3367
01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:02.220
Yeah.

3368
01:39:02.220 --> 01:39:03.390
And did a lot of it is just,

3369
01:39:03.391 --> 01:39:03.541
you know,

3370
01:39:03.541 --> 01:39:04.650
it was a lack of perspective,

3371
01:39:04.680 --> 01:39:07.920
lack of understanding what the consequences of your actions are and these weird

3372
01:39:07.921 --> 01:39:09.450
impulses that teenagers have,

3373
01:39:09.451 --> 01:39:14.451
these weird ancient fucking primate impulses that still exist that are,

3374
01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:15.510
you know,

3375
01:39:15.510 --> 01:39:16.470
I remember them very well.

3376
01:39:16.770 --> 01:39:18.960
I just got over him two or three years ago.

3377
01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:19.801
Yeah,

3378
01:39:19.801 --> 01:39:20.130
man,

3379
01:39:20.130 --> 01:39:20.461
it's,

3380
01:39:20.461 --> 01:39:21.294
um,

3381
01:39:21.570 --> 01:39:22.980
it's not easy evolving.

3382
01:39:23.190 --> 01:39:23.700
The other thing,

3383
01:39:23.700 --> 01:39:23.941
I mean,

3384
01:39:23.941 --> 01:39:25.740
I don't know whether he knew she was 13.

3385
01:39:25.740 --> 01:39:26.970
There are a lot of issues,

3386
01:39:26.971 --> 01:39:27.511
but I mean,

3387
01:39:27.511 --> 01:39:28.344
at the end of the day,

3388
01:39:28.350 --> 01:39:29.700
if you have sex with a 13 year old,

3389
01:39:29.870 --> 01:39:30.270
you know,

3390
01:39:30.270 --> 01:39:31.103
and she's drugged up.

3391
01:39:31.350 --> 01:39:32.183
I Dunno man,

3392
01:39:32.190 --> 01:39:32.910
you know?

3393
01:39:32.910 --> 01:39:33.241
Yeah.

3394
01:39:33.241 --> 01:39:33.631
I can't,

3395
01:39:33.631 --> 01:39:34.440
I can't forgive you.

3396
01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:34.621
No,

3397
01:39:34.621 --> 01:39:35.760
it's a hundred percent crazy.

3398
01:39:35.820 --> 01:39:36.360
Yeah.

3399
01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:37.580
The other two factors though,

3400
01:39:37.581 --> 01:39:39.060
the Holocaust thing and the,

3401
01:39:39.061 --> 01:39:39.480
um,

3402
01:39:39.480 --> 01:39:40.261
whether or not that's true.

3403
01:39:40.261 --> 01:39:41.094
Is that true?

3404
01:39:41.190 --> 01:39:41.970
Do we figure that out?

3405
01:39:41.970 --> 01:39:43.100
I think he had to flee the code.

3406
01:39:43.690 --> 01:39:45.330
He was living in a crack out ghettos.

3407
01:39:45.720 --> 01:39:46.770
He wasn't in like a,

3408
01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:47.371
not a crack.

3409
01:39:47.371 --> 01:39:47.800
I'll get us,

3410
01:39:47.800 --> 01:39:48.690
but let me give an example.

3411
01:39:48.691 --> 01:39:49.021
The crack.

3412
01:39:49.021 --> 01:39:49.710
I'll get us.

3413
01:39:49.710 --> 01:39:51.510
I believe this is a good statistic.

3414
01:39:51.560 --> 01:39:51.860
Uh,

3415
01:39:51.860 --> 01:39:55.080
4 million Jews live there roughly over almost 700 years,

3416
01:39:55.440 --> 01:39:55.910
uh,

3417
01:39:55.910 --> 01:39:56.281
in,

3418
01:39:56.281 --> 01:39:56.670
in,

3419
01:39:56.670 --> 01:39:57.630
in Poland.

3420
01:39:57.810 --> 01:39:59.380
They were a huge part of the fabric,

3421
01:39:59.530 --> 01:40:01.260
the academic fabric and the business fabric.

3422
01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:02.700
And by the end of that,

3423
01:40:02.730 --> 01:40:03.900
four years,

3424
01:40:03.901 --> 01:40:05.460
five years of 4 million,

3425
01:40:05.461 --> 01:40:06.270
5 million Jews,

3426
01:40:06.270 --> 01:40:10.020
there were about less than 50,000 left.

3427
01:40:10.110 --> 01:40:12.030
They'd all been killed and crack.

3428
01:40:12.040 --> 01:40:12.873
I remember most of the,

3429
01:40:12.950 --> 01:40:15.240
the terrible concentration camps were in Poland.

3430
01:40:15.510 --> 01:40:19.740
And if you lived in that Krakow ghetto during that time period,

3431
01:40:19.741 --> 01:40:20.520
it was the worst.

3432
01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:21.353
Some of the worst.

3433
01:40:21.540 --> 01:40:23.760
It's probably one of the worst places to be in the history of the look of that.

3434
01:40:23.761 --> 01:40:24.930
During the age of five,

3435
01:40:24.931 --> 01:40:28.650
he attended primary school for only a few weeks until all the Jewish children

3436
01:40:28.651 --> 01:40:29.540
were abrupt,

3437
01:40:29.690 --> 01:40:30.960
spelled yup.

3438
01:40:31.080 --> 01:40:31.441
God,

3439
01:40:31.441 --> 01:40:33.180
that's gotta be so fucking scary.

3440
01:40:33.890 --> 01:40:36.290
You'll just tell your children who can't go to school anymore because you're

3441
01:40:36.300 --> 01:40:37.133
Jews.

3442
01:40:37.140 --> 01:40:37.750
And they got,

3443
01:40:37.750 --> 01:40:39.060
and they were sent off,

3444
01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:40.710
sent off to concentration camps,

3445
01:40:40.711 --> 01:40:41.610
killed very quickly.

3446
01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:45.000
A lot of them died on the trains,

3447
01:40:45.090 --> 01:40:49.950
on those children over the age of 12 to wear white arm bands with the Blue Star

3448
01:40:49.951 --> 01:40:53.130
of David imprinted for visual identification.

3449
01:40:53.740 --> 01:40:54.790
Fuck.

3450
01:40:55.720 --> 01:40:56.770
Oh.

3451
01:40:57.970 --> 01:40:58.803
And again,

3452
01:40:58.990 --> 01:40:59.890
this doesn't exist.

3453
01:40:59.950 --> 01:41:01.000
His father taken away.

3454
01:41:01.810 --> 01:41:02.591
This is horrible,

3455
01:41:02.591 --> 01:41:03.011
horrible,

3456
01:41:03.011 --> 01:41:03.844
horrible shit.

3457
01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:05.140
Yeah,

3458
01:41:05.140 --> 01:41:05.973
yeah.

3459
01:41:06.610 --> 01:41:08.230
But it's still like,

3460
01:41:08.410 --> 01:41:08.741
okay,

3461
01:41:08.741 --> 01:41:10.930
so what do you do with a guy like that?

3462
01:41:11.920 --> 01:41:12.550
What do you do?

3463
01:41:12.550 --> 01:41:13.840
Do you let him back in here?

3464
01:41:14.500 --> 01:41:16.960
I mean he obviously went through a bunch of horrendous shit.

3465
01:41:17.310 --> 01:41:19.960
Do you make them come back in here and go to jail?

3466
01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:21.153
Like what do you do?

3467
01:41:21.510 --> 01:41:21.941
Like you say,

3468
01:41:21.941 --> 01:41:22.211
Hey,

3469
01:41:22.211 --> 01:41:27.130
you can come back and live in America but you have to go to jail for a year.

3470
01:41:27.420 --> 01:41:27.721
How long,

3471
01:41:27.721 --> 01:41:29.440
how many years you make them go to jail for what he did?

3472
01:41:30.520 --> 01:41:31.353
Um,

3473
01:41:31.600 --> 01:41:32.141
I don't know.

3474
01:41:32.141 --> 01:41:33.490
I can't answer your question.

3475
01:41:33.730 --> 01:41:34.990
I just want in five years,

3476
01:41:34.991 --> 01:41:39.460
like what you know today it would say it would be 25 years at least.

3477
01:41:39.490 --> 01:41:39.880
Right?

3478
01:41:39.880 --> 01:41:41.560
If someone did that to a 13 year old,

3479
01:41:41.561 --> 01:41:43.090
you'd say 25 years in jail.

3480
01:41:44.070 --> 01:41:44.903
Um,

3481
01:41:45.130 --> 01:41:45.880
if,

3482
01:41:45.880 --> 01:41:49.090
if he comes over here and it's so many years after the crime,

3483
01:41:49.390 --> 01:41:52.960
does he have to do the same amount of time that he would have had to do if it

3484
01:41:52.961 --> 01:41:55.660
was the 1970s when he was convicted?

3485
01:41:55.720 --> 01:41:57.400
I don't think that it came over here.

3486
01:41:58.000 --> 01:41:59.860
I don't think if he came over here and now he would,

3487
01:41:59.861 --> 01:42:01.030
he would be thrown in jail.

3488
01:42:01.230 --> 01:42:01.730
Woody.

3489
01:42:01.730 --> 01:42:06.400
But which my part questions would you be subject to the ideas and the laws of

3490
01:42:06.401 --> 01:42:07.930
1970 oh,

3491
01:42:07.931 --> 01:42:08.621
that's interesting.

3492
01:42:08.621 --> 01:42:12.850
What would you be subject to the ideas and the laws of 2015 you were tried in

3493
01:42:12.851 --> 01:42:15.310
absentia then you would be,

3494
01:42:15.490 --> 01:42:16.000
hmm.

3495
01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:16.960
But I'm not sure.

3496
01:42:17.020 --> 01:42:17.620
Yeah,

3497
01:42:17.620 --> 01:42:19.560
because I think the,

3498
01:42:19.590 --> 01:42:23.770
the probably the punishments probably varied between then and now the way,

3499
01:42:24.230 --> 01:42:24.350
<v 2>well,</v>

3500
01:42:24.350 --> 01:42:26.330
the punishments also vary on circumstance.

3501
01:42:26.331 --> 01:42:27.140
So rape,

3502
01:42:27.140 --> 01:42:29.120
murder have a specific,

3503
01:42:29.690 --> 01:42:30.110
you know,

3504
01:42:30.110 --> 01:42:32.150
they carry with them a penalty.

3505
01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:37.720
That penalty is predicated upon the circumstances and a lot of other things.

3506
01:42:38.090 --> 01:42:39.410
But that wasn't always the case.

3507
01:42:39.411 --> 01:42:42.600
Was it a that well there's dead now you're talking about the difference in

3508
01:42:42.601 --> 01:42:44.900
natural law and,

3509
01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:46.370
and you know,

3510
01:42:46.520 --> 01:42:47.410
circumstantial law.

3511
01:42:47.411 --> 01:42:48.100
So you know,

3512
01:42:48.100 --> 01:42:51.560
the natural law would say whatever the case,

3513
01:42:51.561 --> 01:42:52.730
what you did was out of the,

3514
01:42:52.970 --> 01:42:55.900
out of the nature of how human beings are baby,

3515
01:42:55.920 --> 01:42:56.691
you stole something.

3516
01:42:56.691 --> 01:42:57.620
There's no other reason.

3517
01:42:57.650 --> 01:42:58.820
There's no other circumstance.

3518
01:42:58.821 --> 01:42:59.421
It doesn't matter.

3519
01:42:59.421 --> 01:43:00.254
It's not relevant.

3520
01:43:00.260 --> 01:43:01.093
You go to jail,

3521
01:43:01.790 --> 01:43:02.630
you killed somebody.

3522
01:43:02.690 --> 01:43:05.840
The fact of the matter is that it's unnatural kill somebody.

3523
01:43:05.841 --> 01:43:06.090
You,

3524
01:43:06.090 --> 01:43:06.320
you,

3525
01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:07.153
you pay with your life.

3526
01:43:08.210 --> 01:43:11.150
Modern societies realize that crimes are committed.

3527
01:43:11.210 --> 01:43:11.750
Um,

3528
01:43:11.750 --> 01:43:13.130
and I don't even think was modern societies.

3529
01:43:13.131 --> 01:43:13.341
I mean,

3530
01:43:13.341 --> 01:43:14.360
there was always the question.

3531
01:43:14.390 --> 01:43:14.520
I mean,

3532
01:43:14.520 --> 01:43:15.860
they're the biggest CICERO,

3533
01:43:16.100 --> 01:43:17.750
he goes back to the Romans where it says,

3534
01:43:17.751 --> 01:43:18.260
look,

3535
01:43:18.260 --> 01:43:20.330
if you park your chariot here,

3536
01:43:20.660 --> 01:43:20.931
uh,

3537
01:43:20.931 --> 01:43:21.830
in this town,

3538
01:43:21.920 --> 01:43:22.620
well you're,

3539
01:43:22.620 --> 01:43:23.630
you're going to get a fine.

3540
01:43:23.690 --> 01:43:23.931
Oh,

3541
01:43:23.931 --> 01:43:24.561
but you know what,

3542
01:43:24.561 --> 01:43:25.790
where I live in Carthage,

3543
01:43:25.940 --> 01:43:27.500
I can park my chariot there.

3544
01:43:27.650 --> 01:43:28.180
And the guy goes,

3545
01:43:28.180 --> 01:43:28.350
right,

3546
01:43:28.350 --> 01:43:28.880
well here's a,

3547
01:43:28.880 --> 01:43:29.960
here's a morning.

3548
01:43:30.050 --> 01:43:32.180
Don't do it again because now you're in Rome.

3549
01:43:32.690 --> 01:43:37.130
But if you snatch a baby out of a woman's arms and kill it or something

3550
01:43:37.340 --> 01:43:38.000
terrible,

3551
01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:38.833
regardless,

3552
01:43:38.840 --> 01:43:41.360
the law will say in Rome,

3553
01:43:41.510 --> 01:43:42.343
no,

3554
01:43:42.560 --> 01:43:43.341
you go to jail.

3555
01:43:43.341 --> 01:43:44.210
Nobody in Carthage,

3556
01:43:44.211 --> 01:43:45.110
we're allowed to do that.

3557
01:43:45.111 --> 01:43:46.970
Or I'm from the Mongol talked our steps.

3558
01:43:46.971 --> 01:43:47.804
We do that.

3559
01:43:47.960 --> 01:43:48.740
Fine.

3560
01:43:48.740 --> 01:43:49.370
That's fine.

3561
01:43:49.370 --> 01:43:51.950
You're still gonna pay with your why,

3562
01:43:52.220 --> 01:43:57.220
because what you did falls under an unnatural act.

3563
01:43:58.010 --> 01:44:00.410
So no matter what your culture says,

3564
01:44:00.710 --> 01:44:05.710
that was an unnatural act and unnatural acts which would meaning they were

3565
01:44:05.841 --> 01:44:09.110
outside the realm of human conduct.

3566
01:44:09.530 --> 01:44:12.260
And so you must pay a price regardless of where you're from,

3567
01:44:12.290 --> 01:44:14.570
including whether or not you knew that was right or wrong.

3568
01:44:15.100 --> 01:44:17.990
That's a very important aspect of law.

3569
01:44:18.230 --> 01:44:19.460
It's something that you know,

3570
01:44:19.490 --> 01:44:20.990
that people talk about all the time.

3571
01:44:21.380 --> 01:44:25.040
That's how you start drawing distinctions between crimes that are,

3572
01:44:25.420 --> 01:44:26.253
um,

3573
01:44:26.420 --> 01:44:31.420
excusable based on circumstance and crimes that just like drugs or how about

3574
01:44:33.320 --> 01:44:34.400
drug smuggling is one thing,

3575
01:44:34.401 --> 01:44:38.540
but there are crimes like all of us in most societies would suggest that if an

3576
01:44:38.541 --> 01:44:40.910
adult has sex with a five year old,

3577
01:44:41.300 --> 01:44:42.140
I don't give a fuck.

3578
01:44:42.240 --> 01:44:43.011
So natural.

3579
01:44:43.011 --> 01:44:44.240
It's not unnatural crime.

3580
01:44:44.420 --> 01:44:44.880
And you're,

3581
01:44:44.880 --> 01:44:45.470
you're gonna do,

3582
01:44:45.470 --> 01:44:46.730
you're going to do your juicy

3583
01:44:47.410 --> 01:44:51.850
<v 1>growed creator got life in prison without the possibility of parole.</v>

3584
01:44:52.150 --> 01:44:52.983
No.

3585
01:44:53.200 --> 01:44:54.033
Did you see that?

3586
01:44:54.160 --> 01:44:54.940
It's insane.

3587
01:44:54.940 --> 01:44:56.850
The Silk Road has in itself kind of stuff?

3588
01:44:56.870 --> 01:44:57.130
No,

3589
01:44:57.130 --> 01:45:00.490
the Silk Road was a dark web.

3590
01:45:00.750 --> 01:45:01.210
Uh,

3591
01:45:01.210 --> 01:45:02.080
there's a great,

3592
01:45:02.170 --> 01:45:02.900
um,

3593
01:45:02.900 --> 01:45:04.840
a documentary by Alex Winter,

3594
01:45:04.841 --> 01:45:05.410
what's it called?

3595
01:45:05.410 --> 01:45:06.243
The deep web.

3596
01:45:06.730 --> 01:45:08.350
And it's about the dark web.

3597
01:45:08.410 --> 01:45:09.400
It's about this,

3598
01:45:09.430 --> 01:45:14.430
this system that was created by the military and they were using it to buy and

3599
01:45:16.151 --> 01:45:17.080
sell drugs.

3600
01:45:17.140 --> 01:45:20.680
And some people who bought those drugs died and they,

3601
01:45:20.920 --> 01:45:24.220
they overdosed these people that were using it.

3602
01:45:24.221 --> 01:45:24.970
We're not him.

3603
01:45:24.970 --> 01:45:26.050
It wasn't the guy who created it.

3604
01:45:26.051 --> 01:45:28.390
The guy created just a portal for people to use it.

3605
01:45:28.540 --> 01:45:33.520
He created a way for people to communicate and exchange drugs for money or for

3606
01:45:33.521 --> 01:45:37.150
bitcoins or for whatever they were investigated by the DEA agents,

3607
01:45:37.180 --> 01:45:42.180
turned out the DEA and stole like hundreds of thousands of dollars in bitcoin

3608
01:45:42.700 --> 01:45:46.030
and transferred it into personal accounts and there was a lot of fuckery

3609
01:45:46.031 --> 01:45:51.031
involved and he went to jail and they just tried him and convicted him and the

3610
01:45:53.171 --> 01:45:58.171
judge sentenced him to life in prison life for creating a website that appeals

3611
01:45:58.630 --> 01:45:59.410
not successful.

3612
01:45:59.410 --> 01:46:02.410
He will concurrently serve two life sentences,

3613
01:46:02.620 --> 01:46:03.850
a 20 year sentence,

3614
01:46:03.851 --> 01:46:05.230
a 15 year old sentence,

3615
01:46:05.380 --> 01:46:09.370
15 year sentence and a five year sentence without parole.

3616
01:46:09.790 --> 01:46:10.270
Wow.

3617
01:46:10.270 --> 01:46:11.081
Fuck man.

3618
01:46:11.081 --> 01:46:13.330
For creating this technology,

3619
01:46:13.331 --> 01:46:17.380
this sort of a secret tunnel to,

3620
01:46:17.470 --> 01:46:17.780
well he,

3621
01:46:17.780 --> 01:46:18.070
he,

3622
01:46:18.070 --> 01:46:21.940
he created a way for people to be able to buy and sell drugs,

3623
01:46:22.060 --> 01:46:23.020
illegal drugs.

3624
01:46:23.500 --> 01:46:26.080
Was he working for a cartel or something or no?

3625
01:46:26.081 --> 01:46:26.321
No.

3626
01:46:26.321 --> 01:46:27.250
He was working.

3627
01:46:27.280 --> 01:46:31.690
He thought he was working for good because he's talented programmer and he

3628
01:46:31.691 --> 01:46:35.530
figured out a way to let people buy things that they wanted to buy.

3629
01:46:35.800 --> 01:46:40.800
It was giving people the opportunity away to anonymously or semi anonymously

3630
01:46:42.670 --> 01:46:47.670
trade goods and funds for things that were deemed prohibited from some guys that

3631
01:46:47.981 --> 01:46:51.120
they weren't able to argue create a better defense for him.

3632
01:46:51.390 --> 01:46:51.751
Well,

3633
01:46:51.751 --> 01:46:52.950
I don't think you get a chance to,

3634
01:46:52.951 --> 01:46:53.221
man.

3635
01:46:53.221 --> 01:46:55.920
I think you'd get railroaded by the government in these sort of cases.

3636
01:46:56.070 --> 01:46:57.540
They wanted to convict him.

3637
01:46:57.830 --> 01:46:58.130
You know,

3638
01:46:58.130 --> 01:46:58.350
they,

3639
01:46:58.350 --> 01:46:59.310
if they want to,

3640
01:46:59.311 --> 01:47:01.140
they can keep things out of evidence.

3641
01:47:01.141 --> 01:47:04.890
Like the idea that you get a totally fair trial is really sad.

3642
01:47:05.080 --> 01:47:05.410
It's,

3643
01:47:05.410 --> 01:47:06.570
it's not the case,

3644
01:47:06.571 --> 01:47:07.980
especially when it comes to drugs.

3645
01:47:08.280 --> 01:47:08.491
You know,

3646
01:47:08.491 --> 01:47:12.270
when Tom Mccormick got arrested and he went to jail for growing medical

3647
01:47:12.271 --> 01:47:14.340
marijuana legally under state laws,

3648
01:47:14.341 --> 01:47:15.240
the addressed him,

3649
01:47:15.300 --> 01:47:18.060
they arrested him and prosecuted him in a federal court.

3650
01:47:18.300 --> 01:47:19.620
When they get you in a federal court,

3651
01:47:19.621 --> 01:47:23.010
the first thing they tell you is there is no such thing as medical marijuana.

3652
01:47:23.011 --> 01:47:25.170
So you're not allowed to mention medical marijuana.

3653
01:47:25.290 --> 01:47:26.670
You can't use it as defense.

3654
01:47:26.671 --> 01:47:30.840
You can't bring it up like you could cause a mistrial or you could get

3655
01:47:31.350 --> 01:47:32.640
sanctioned by the court.

3656
01:47:32.850 --> 01:47:35.040
If you change the definitions,

3657
01:47:35.041 --> 01:47:37.980
if you bring up the fact that it's legal in your state,

3658
01:47:38.100 --> 01:47:39.660
so this is not legal federally,

3659
01:47:39.661 --> 01:47:40.260
it's irrelevant.

3660
01:47:40.260 --> 01:47:45.260
So they silence you from communicating the realities of this nuance situation.

3661
01:47:45.630 --> 01:47:47.310
They try to pretend that it's black and white.

3662
01:47:47.311 --> 01:47:48.210
You were selling drugs,

3663
01:47:48.211 --> 01:47:49.044
yes or no?

3664
01:47:49.350 --> 01:47:49.711
Well,

3665
01:47:49.711 --> 01:47:50.340
yes,

3666
01:47:50.340 --> 01:47:54.090
but I was selling the legally in the state of California as voted upon by the

3667
01:47:54.091 --> 01:47:55.170
people of California.

3668
01:47:55.350 --> 01:47:56.940
There was a proposition that was passed.

3669
01:47:56.941 --> 01:47:58.290
Medical marijuana was passed.

3670
01:47:58.470 --> 01:48:01.530
I was selling it legally through this proposition.

3671
01:48:01.770 --> 01:48:02.071
And you,

3672
01:48:02.071 --> 01:48:02.904
they can't say that.

3673
01:48:03.060 --> 01:48:07.050
So he went to jail because he never in his defense that he ever was he ever

3674
01:48:07.051 --> 01:48:12.051
allowed to even say he was growing it legally in his state because federal

3675
01:48:12.570 --> 01:48:13.350
charges,

3676
01:48:13.350 --> 01:48:14.850
Trump state law,

3677
01:48:15.840 --> 01:48:18.630
federal government just decides their dictators.

3678
01:48:18.810 --> 01:48:19.890
They just decide,

3679
01:48:20.100 --> 01:48:21.960
I don't give a fuck what you voted for.

3680
01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:23.490
The whole group of us,

3681
01:48:23.850 --> 01:48:24.211
we say,

3682
01:48:24.211 --> 01:48:24.930
fuck you.

3683
01:48:24.930 --> 01:48:25.411
And we say,

3684
01:48:25.411 --> 01:48:28.860
fuck you about something that's never killed a single person ever.

3685
01:48:28.920 --> 01:48:29.520
Amazing.

3686
01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:33.240
We were were were talking about all these different things that kill people were

3687
01:48:33.241 --> 01:48:37.710
talking about salt killing people and aspirin killing people and how many people

3688
01:48:37.711 --> 01:48:39.210
die from drinking too much water?

3689
01:48:39.930 --> 01:48:42.690
Even though millions of people smoke weed,

3690
01:48:42.720 --> 01:48:44.220
no one dies from it.

3691
01:48:44.370 --> 01:48:45.810
You just can't do it.

3692
01:48:46.170 --> 01:48:47.160
You can't do it.

3693
01:48:47.370 --> 01:48:50.310
You could die from water way quicker than you could die from.

3694
01:48:50.311 --> 01:48:51.460
Weird God.

3695
01:48:51.470 --> 01:48:51.900
Damn.

3696
01:48:51.900 --> 01:48:53.550
It's stupid as fuck.

3697
01:48:53.910 --> 01:48:57.390
And the fact that people will go to jail for that and have gone to jail for that

3698
01:48:57.420 --> 01:48:59.580
is stupid as fuck.

3699
01:48:59.610 --> 01:49:00.443
It's a mantra.

3700
01:49:00.810 --> 01:49:01.643
It's changing.

3701
01:49:01.770 --> 01:49:02.431
It's another thing.

3702
01:49:02.431 --> 01:49:04.170
I think the evidence is just too overwhelming.

3703
01:49:04.260 --> 01:49:04.710
It is.

3704
01:49:04.710 --> 01:49:05.501
It's an old law,

3705
01:49:05.501 --> 01:49:06.840
but it's amazing how,

3706
01:49:07.140 --> 01:49:10.870
how slowly these things move when it comes to,

3707
01:49:11.010 --> 01:49:13.020
to getting rid of a law get,

3708
01:49:13.021 --> 01:49:16.290
because there's a kind of the up around enforcing that law.

3709
01:49:16.291 --> 01:49:16.920
Exactly,

3710
01:49:16.920 --> 01:49:21.030
and there's a lot of money in enforcing lobbyists when it comes to prison guard

3711
01:49:21.040 --> 01:49:24.600
groups that want to keep their jobs privatized prisons.

3712
01:49:24.900 --> 01:49:25.890
There's a lot of that.

3713
01:49:25.980 --> 01:49:30.270
It's a lot of really with the flat tax and well why not just tax people a

3714
01:49:30.271 --> 01:49:33.060
certain percentage just make a flat tax and no big deal.

3715
01:49:33.440 --> 01:49:35.640
There are just too many vested interests in,

3716
01:49:35.670 --> 01:49:36.421
you know the,

3717
01:49:36.421 --> 01:49:39.690
how the tax code is so complicated.

3718
01:49:40.050 --> 01:49:43.860
You got to hire accountants and you've got to hire a lot of people that help you

3719
01:49:43.861 --> 01:49:44.491
with that stuff.

3720
01:49:44.491 --> 01:49:44.701
I mean,

3721
01:49:44.701 --> 01:49:47.350
so do you think that's why people don't want a flat tire?

3722
01:49:47.380 --> 01:49:48.010
It's one of the

3723
01:49:48.010 --> 01:49:49.150
<v 2>reasons the pressure,</v>

3724
01:49:49.480 --> 01:49:51.580
the pressure is on conspiracy.

3725
01:49:51.581 --> 01:49:56.410
It's just it people who have an incentive to keep the system the way it is.

3726
01:49:56.440 --> 01:49:59.560
Well it's also the fact that we were talking about before where you don't have

3727
01:49:59.561 --> 01:49:59.950
to,

3728
01:49:59.950 --> 01:50:03.040
they don't have to account for all the money that you give them.

3729
01:50:03.130 --> 01:50:04.030
That seems insane.

3730
01:50:04.300 --> 01:50:08.080
Like could you imagine a new system if they tried to start it off with fresh

3731
01:50:08.081 --> 01:50:09.220
today we just want,

3732
01:50:09.250 --> 01:50:09.491
you know,

3733
01:50:09.491 --> 01:50:11.230
x amount of money and a don't worry about it.

3734
01:50:11.231 --> 01:50:12.250
We're just going to run everything.

3735
01:50:12.540 --> 01:50:14.800
But you should show me where my money went.

3736
01:50:14.830 --> 01:50:16.060
Show everybody where their money,

3737
01:50:16.061 --> 01:50:16.250
man.

3738
01:50:16.250 --> 01:50:16.360
No,

3739
01:50:16.360 --> 01:50:17.330
it's all compare notes.

3740
01:50:17.410 --> 01:50:17.750
Yeah.

3741
01:50:17.750 --> 01:50:20.900
Find out how much money is being spent on shit that we don't want.

3742
01:50:21.070 --> 01:50:21.903
All right?

3743
01:50:22.240 --> 01:50:22.741
You don't get it.

3744
01:50:22.741 --> 01:50:23.200
Say,

3745
01:50:23.200 --> 01:50:25.320
well right now I don't know what I'm taxed,

3746
01:50:25.321 --> 01:50:26.560
but I probably see half of my money.

3747
01:50:26.590 --> 01:50:28.330
Just think about you work for the government.

3748
01:50:28.360 --> 01:50:33.040
I was going to say 50% of my day is spent working for someone else.

3749
01:50:33.560 --> 01:50:34.600
You sort of government,

3750
01:50:34.601 --> 01:50:36.610
you spend a lot of money.

3751
01:50:37.060 --> 01:50:41.050
That money gets taxed on everything you buy gets taxed.

3752
01:50:41.260 --> 01:50:42.370
And on top of that,

3753
01:50:42.490 --> 01:50:43.930
the money itself gets taxed.

3754
01:50:43.931 --> 01:50:44.764
Yeah,

3755
01:50:44.920 --> 01:50:45.310
that's right.

3756
01:50:45.310 --> 01:50:46.000
So how much,

3757
01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:49.310
how much they really need [inaudible] how are you feeling?

3758
01:50:49.600 --> 01:50:50.550
What are they doing with it?

3759
01:50:50.650 --> 01:50:54.190
Passing laws and forcing those laws and taxing.

3760
01:50:55.180 --> 01:50:58.000
It takes a lot to run a coercive,

3761
01:50:58.020 --> 01:51:01.720
a body called the u s federal government.

3762
01:51:02.260 --> 01:51:02.710
Um,

3763
01:51:02.710 --> 01:51:05.530
you need that almost libertarian beliefs.

3764
01:51:05.560 --> 01:51:08.500
The libertarian believes that government should be treated like a necessary

3765
01:51:08.501 --> 01:51:09.334
evil.

3766
01:51:09.610 --> 01:51:10.070
A,

3767
01:51:10.070 --> 01:51:11.800
you need it for some things.

3768
01:51:11.950 --> 01:51:12.471
That's it.

3769
01:51:12.471 --> 01:51:13.304
That's the motto.

3770
01:51:13.510 --> 01:51:14.320
But you,

3771
01:51:14.320 --> 01:51:14.770
you,

3772
01:51:14.770 --> 01:51:16.780
you should treat it as though it's a necessary evil.

3773
01:51:16.781 --> 01:51:19.720
Be will be aware that government always does two things.

3774
01:51:19.750 --> 01:51:23.750
It always grows and it's nature is coercive and,

3775
01:51:23.830 --> 01:51:26.230
and I'm going to quote my father is not my idea,

3776
01:51:26.560 --> 01:51:31.030
but he always says government is in business of intent not results.

3777
01:51:31.230 --> 01:51:32.560
There is an intention.

3778
01:51:32.890 --> 01:51:33.671
There's an intention.

3779
01:51:33.671 --> 01:51:35.170
I'm going to pass a healthcare law.

3780
01:51:35.520 --> 01:51:35.740
Uh,

3781
01:51:35.740 --> 01:51:37.420
it's going to be 2,400 pages.

3782
01:51:37.421 --> 01:51:38.320
Nobody will read it.

3783
01:51:38.350 --> 01:51:39.760
No one who voted into law.

3784
01:51:39.820 --> 01:51:40.421
They're not going to read it.

3785
01:51:40.421 --> 01:51:41.410
It's just too complicated.

3786
01:51:41.650 --> 01:51:45.100
But it will be 2,400 pages and actually more than that at the end of it.

3787
01:51:45.610 --> 01:51:46.150
Um,

3788
01:51:46.150 --> 01:51:51.150
and it's intended to make healthcare more affordable for everybody who wouldn't

3789
01:51:51.341 --> 01:51:52.030
want that.

3790
01:51:52.030 --> 01:51:52.863
I do.

3791
01:51:53.130 --> 01:51:54.220
It's like the Patriot Act.

3792
01:51:54.550 --> 01:51:55.570
It's the intention.

3793
01:51:55.600 --> 01:51:57.790
Now let's see how it works in practice.

3794
01:51:57.940 --> 01:51:59.200
That's what you have to be aware of.

3795
01:51:59.201 --> 01:52:00.310
It's not very effective.

3796
01:52:00.311 --> 01:52:01.570
And more importantly,

3797
01:52:01.750 --> 01:52:04.960
we should all know that it's not the only answer.

3798
01:52:05.200 --> 01:52:10.200
There are other ways to engineer what we call equality of opportunity.

3799
01:52:11.830 --> 01:52:12.910
There are other ways.

3800
01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.070
You just have to be a little more creative than to say,

3801
01:52:15.220 --> 01:52:17.830
let's tack people tax the rich quote unquote,

3802
01:52:18.130 --> 01:52:18.331
what?

3803
01:52:18.331 --> 01:52:18.581
By the way,

3804
01:52:18.581 --> 01:52:19.690
the rich and the poor,

3805
01:52:19.840 --> 01:52:20.621
it's always changing.

3806
01:52:20.621 --> 01:52:20.921
Isn't it?

3807
01:52:20.921 --> 01:52:21.820
Isn't it always moving?

3808
01:52:21.821 --> 01:52:23.470
Some people start out in bad jobs,

3809
01:52:23.560 --> 01:52:24.460
they worked their way up.

3810
01:52:24.670 --> 01:52:25.540
Make a lot of money.

3811
01:52:26.080 --> 01:52:28.870
You got to just be careful with when you talk about this stuff,

3812
01:52:28.900 --> 01:52:33.900
it's a changing definition and we are stuck in orthodoxy of thinking.

3813
01:52:35.200 --> 01:52:36.610
Well it's a break in the camps.

3814
01:52:36.611 --> 01:52:39.760
It was established a long fucking time ago when the world was different,

3815
01:52:40.090 --> 01:52:43.330
the world was way different when they started establishing income tax.

3816
01:52:43.331 --> 01:52:45.770
It was just way different and we can just,

3817
01:52:46.100 --> 01:52:49.400
<v 0>they could get away with dictator type shit like that.</v>

3818
01:52:49.790 --> 01:52:52.940
But if there was no tax system in place and they just started taxing us,

3819
01:52:53.060 --> 01:52:53.811
taking all this money,

3820
01:52:53.811 --> 01:52:54.170
we were like,

3821
01:52:54.170 --> 01:52:54.561
well Whoa,

3822
01:52:54.561 --> 01:52:54.801
whoa,

3823
01:52:54.801 --> 01:52:55.041
Whoa,

3824
01:52:55.041 --> 01:52:55.431
whoa.

3825
01:52:55.431 --> 01:52:56.640
What the fuck man?

3826
01:52:57.110 --> 01:52:58.910
Like if you were just paying state taxes,

3827
01:52:59.060 --> 01:53:00.770
I think we should be paying income tax,

3828
01:53:01.700 --> 01:53:02.421
sales tax,

3829
01:53:02.421 --> 01:53:04.010
but there's a way to make taxes really fair.

3830
01:53:04.011 --> 01:53:04.611
Like I think there's,

3831
01:53:04.611 --> 01:53:05.720
I should be a carbon tax.

3832
01:53:05.721 --> 01:53:06.554
And what I mean by that,

3833
01:53:06.580 --> 01:53:07.970
I said you spend a lot of money on,

3834
01:53:08.210 --> 01:53:09.680
if you put a lot of carbon in the air,

3835
01:53:10.370 --> 01:53:12.230
then just pay your share that so,

3836
01:53:12.231 --> 01:53:12.861
so in other words,

3837
01:53:12.861 --> 01:53:13.910
if you have a really big,

3838
01:53:13.911 --> 01:53:16.010
you want to buy a big truck with lots of power,

3839
01:53:16.230 --> 01:53:17.030
that's fine,

3840
01:53:17.030 --> 01:53:18.590
but it's going to cost you a little more money.

3841
01:53:18.800 --> 01:53:19.520
Your where you,

3842
01:53:19.520 --> 01:53:20.030
whatever,

3843
01:53:20.030 --> 01:53:21.770
whatever carbon you use,

3844
01:53:21.800 --> 01:53:22.633
whatever,

3845
01:53:22.760 --> 01:53:25.610
depending on how much we'll kind of fossil fuel use can to put out a certain

3846
01:53:25.850 --> 01:53:26.690
metric of,

3847
01:53:26.720 --> 01:53:28.250
of carbon in the air,

3848
01:53:29.390 --> 01:53:30.500
you could tax it that way.

3849
01:53:30.530 --> 01:53:31.450
You don't have to accept that.

3850
01:53:31.470 --> 01:53:32.210
Makes Sense.

3851
01:53:32.210 --> 01:53:33.110
It also makes sense,

3852
01:53:33.111 --> 01:53:36.770
the idea that if you buy something like say if you buy a new car,

3853
01:53:36.980 --> 01:53:38.180
you're going to use the roads.

3854
01:53:38.450 --> 01:53:40.300
Like you should like the,

3855
01:53:40.320 --> 01:53:45.020
you're benefiting from some other work that had to be done and I had to be paid

3856
01:53:45.021 --> 01:53:45.560
for.

3857
01:53:45.560 --> 01:53:49.250
So for every percentage of every car they should be something that goes to some

3858
01:53:49.251 --> 01:53:49.851
highway fund.

3859
01:53:49.851 --> 01:53:50.451
I think there is,

3860
01:53:50.451 --> 01:53:50.930
by the way.

3861
01:53:50.930 --> 01:53:51.651
That makes sense.

3862
01:53:51.651 --> 01:53:51.920
Yeah,

3863
01:53:51.920 --> 01:53:52.790
that totally makes sense.

3864
01:53:52.820 --> 01:53:53.360
Yeah.

3865
01:53:53.360 --> 01:53:54.800
I think a lot of taxes makes sense.

3866
01:53:54.801 --> 01:53:59.360
What doesn't make sense is that we don't get an accounting of it and that it's

3867
01:53:59.390 --> 01:53:59.901
totally,

3868
01:53:59.901 --> 01:54:01.550
I mean the budget and the,

3869
01:54:01.700 --> 01:54:03.180
when you find out what the deficit is,

3870
01:54:03.181 --> 01:54:03.381
you're like,

3871
01:54:03.381 --> 01:54:03.711
wait a minute,

3872
01:54:03.711 --> 01:54:04.650
what are you talking about?

3873
01:54:04.651 --> 01:54:05.570
How would that even mean?

3874
01:54:05.600 --> 01:54:08.220
Trillions of you owe trillions to fucking hoo.

3875
01:54:08.270 --> 01:54:08.500
Let,

3876
01:54:08.500 --> 01:54:09.590
let me ask you this question.

3877
01:54:09.620 --> 01:54:10.490
So when you,

3878
01:54:10.491 --> 01:54:11.690
you're paying for social security,

3879
01:54:11.691 --> 01:54:12.410
whether you know it or not,

3880
01:54:12.410 --> 01:54:13.000
you're paying,

3881
01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:14.750
you're paying so security.

3882
01:54:14.751 --> 01:54:19.130
So when you retire at 65 you'll be eligible to a check every month or we can get

3883
01:54:19.131 --> 01:54:20.000
that even if you're rich.

3884
01:54:20.020 --> 01:54:20.840
Now let me ask you this.

3885
01:54:20.840 --> 01:54:23.270
You do well you do good question,

3886
01:54:23.600 --> 01:54:25.250
but more importantly that's crazy.

3887
01:54:25.280 --> 01:54:27.140
You're going to get it when it starts at 65 right?

3888
01:54:27.170 --> 01:54:28.010
It's the people's bank.

3889
01:54:28.610 --> 01:54:30.950
What happens when you die at 64 what happens to that money?

3890
01:54:31.190 --> 01:54:32.660
What happens exactly?

3891
01:54:32.750 --> 01:54:33.350
Guess what?

3892
01:54:33.350 --> 01:54:34.790
What family doesn't get it?

3893
01:54:34.930 --> 01:54:36.260
Well that's what I understand.

3894
01:54:36.261 --> 01:54:39.590
It goes into the ether so someone steals it.

3895
01:54:41.390 --> 01:54:42.080
Where does your,

3896
01:54:42.080 --> 01:54:43.700
where does your self security go when you die?

3897
01:54:44.120 --> 01:54:45.080
Back into the till.

3898
01:54:45.440 --> 01:54:46.273
It's what I believe.

3899
01:54:46.400 --> 01:54:47.780
And then what happens there?

3900
01:54:48.730 --> 01:54:49.563
Um,

3901
01:54:49.580 --> 01:54:51.920
I don't know if you've been paying into a til for a long time.

3902
01:54:51.950 --> 01:54:52.041
Well,

3903
01:54:52.041 --> 01:54:54.440
you have to look no further than civil forfeiture laws.

3904
01:54:54.500 --> 01:54:57.170
Look at those fucking creepy things where they just pull you over and you have

3905
01:54:57.171 --> 01:54:59.540
10,000 bucks on you and they decide we're going to take it because we think

3906
01:54:59.541 --> 01:55:02.270
you're selling drugs and you think those are by on my way to buy a fucking car.

3907
01:55:02.480 --> 01:55:04.400
They could take your money and then you've got to fight for it and Cora,

3908
01:55:04.401 --> 01:55:07.520
while you're going to have to prove it big guy and they'll take your fucking

3909
01:55:07.521 --> 01:55:09.500
money and spend it on shit for the,

3910
01:55:09.530 --> 01:55:10.520
it's the biggest thing.

3911
01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:12.830
It's the biggest thing you have to watch out for.

3912
01:55:12.831 --> 01:55:13.850
It's kind of got busted.

3913
01:55:13.851 --> 01:55:17.270
They bought a Margarita machine with the money that they stole from someone that

3914
01:55:17.290 --> 01:55:18.123
I surprise.

3915
01:55:18.170 --> 01:55:19.040
What a surprise.

3916
01:55:19.250 --> 01:55:21.630
The growth of the state and what you mean by growth is state.

3917
01:55:21.631 --> 01:55:23.240
It's just more people or people,

3918
01:55:23.270 --> 01:55:25.370
people who are in a position of power over you.

3919
01:55:25.430 --> 01:55:27.080
And when they have something written down,

3920
01:55:27.200 --> 01:55:29.330
they think they're allowed to enforce it because it's written down.

3921
01:55:29.331 --> 01:55:30.051
It's a law look.

3922
01:55:30.051 --> 01:55:30.800
It's written right there.

3923
01:55:30.800 --> 01:55:31.350
Yeah.

3924
01:55:31.350 --> 01:55:32.630
Even if it doesn't make any sense.

3925
01:55:32.660 --> 01:55:33.530
And then you have to,

3926
01:55:33.531 --> 01:55:36.860
don't forget if you have a law and then you have people that enforce the law,

3927
01:55:36.861 --> 01:55:38.390
you must also have watchdogs,

3928
01:55:38.391 --> 01:55:41.810
you have to have an agency that actually watches those people just like the cops

3929
01:55:41.811 --> 01:55:42.710
having turned on the Ferris.

3930
01:55:42.940 --> 01:55:44.250
But who watches the watchers?

3931
01:55:45.250 --> 01:55:45.481
So,

3932
01:55:45.481 --> 01:55:45.691
so,

3933
01:55:45.691 --> 01:55:45.991
so,

3934
01:55:45.991 --> 01:55:49.350
so the biggest question in political philosophy is what the biggest question and

3935
01:55:49.351 --> 01:55:50.131
political philosophy is.

3936
01:55:50.131 --> 01:55:52.350
Who is governing the governor?

3937
01:55:52.800 --> 01:55:53.340
Yeah.

3938
01:55:53.340 --> 01:55:54.450
I'm so fucking profound.

3939
01:55:54.660 --> 01:55:55.261
Not really.

3940
01:55:55.261 --> 01:55:56.011
Hey Jamie,

3941
01:55:56.011 --> 01:55:58.020
can you look up that social security statistic,

3942
01:55:58.170 --> 01:55:59.550
which is where's the money go.

3943
01:56:00.240 --> 01:56:01.073
Thank you.

3944
01:56:01.170 --> 01:56:02.580
We're going to have to wrap this pitch up.

3945
01:56:02.910 --> 01:56:03.743
What time is it?

3946
01:56:04.330 --> 01:56:07.410
Four 17 Irvine tonight before I forget.

3947
01:56:08.040 --> 01:56:11.020
And Big Brown would kick my ass if she should go ahead.

3948
01:56:11.490 --> 01:56:13.830
Our shirts are dropping Monday at 7:00 PM.

3949
01:56:13.831 --> 01:56:18.300
We've got these new awesome shirts that I wish I said I had a hand in designing,

3950
01:56:18.301 --> 01:56:19.134
but big brown did.

3951
01:56:19.440 --> 01:56:20.001
And uh,

3952
01:56:20.001 --> 01:56:20.240
there,

3953
01:56:20.240 --> 01:56:22.140
there are some of our best shots yet seven o'clock,

3954
01:56:22.141 --> 01:56:22.531
Monday,

3955
01:56:22.531 --> 01:56:24.990
7:00 PM they're dropping foster kitties.

3956
01:56:25.110 --> 01:56:26.040
Here's the reality.

3957
01:56:26.100 --> 01:56:29.430
If you should die before you begin to get your monthly check,

3958
01:56:29.431 --> 01:56:33.780
your family will get a payment in cash amounting to 3.5 cents on every dollar of

3959
01:56:33.781 --> 01:56:36.090
wages you have earned after 1936.

3960
01:56:36.570 --> 01:56:37.440
If for example,

3961
01:56:37.441 --> 01:56:42.330
you should die at age 64 and you had earned $25 a week for 10 years before that

3962
01:56:42.331 --> 01:56:42.631
time,

3963
01:56:42.631 --> 01:56:45.360
your family would receive $455.

3964
01:56:46.200 --> 01:56:47.100
That's not much.

3965
01:56:47.340 --> 01:56:48.840
I think that's trying to say.

3966
01:56:48.841 --> 01:56:49.860
On the other hand,

3967
01:56:49.861 --> 01:56:51.810
it says on tile other hand.

3968
01:56:52.020 --> 01:56:52.920
On the other hand,

3969
01:56:53.340 --> 01:56:56.520
if you have not worked enough to get the regular monthly checks,

3970
01:56:56.521 --> 01:56:57.690
by the time you're 65,

3971
01:56:57.691 --> 01:56:59.070
you will get a lump sum.

3972
01:56:59.610 --> 01:57:00.570
Or if you should die,

3973
01:57:00.571 --> 01:57:02.970
your family or a state would get a lumps on.

3974
01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:08.000
So you want to get one 3.5 cents on every dollar of wage Jews that you earned,

3975
01:57:09.450 --> 01:57:14.450
they get $3.50 cents on every dollar of wages that you earned after 1930.

3976
01:57:14.941 --> 01:57:19.941
So is that 3.5% 3.5 cents on every dollar.

3977
01:57:20.280 --> 01:57:21.120
That would be three blank.

3978
01:57:21.121 --> 01:57:25.830
This is also from 1936 oh Jesus could have also changed since then.

3979
01:57:26.160 --> 01:57:26.731
So security,

3980
01:57:26.731 --> 01:57:29.010
we shouldn't read anything for those people thought the world was flat.

3981
01:57:29.520 --> 01:57:30.660
I think it might be different now.

3982
01:57:31.890 --> 01:57:32.880
It might be different.

3983
01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:36.420
There's not a lot on this country will give it is the social security,

3984
01:57:36.421 --> 01:57:38.460
the idea of who knows how much it's changed.

3985
01:57:38.790 --> 01:57:40.140
But the idea behind it is great.

3986
01:57:40.170 --> 01:57:43.470
You know the idea that you're going to throw some money in and that it's going

3987
01:57:43.471 --> 01:57:45.720
to help old people out when they can't work anymore.

3988
01:57:45.850 --> 01:57:46.651
It sounds wonderful.

3989
01:57:46.651 --> 01:57:48.120
But they live in abject poverty,

3990
01:57:48.550 --> 01:57:48.870
you know,

3991
01:57:48.870 --> 01:57:49.610
and pay much.

3992
01:57:49.610 --> 01:57:50.880
Gotta pay so little.

3993
01:57:50.940 --> 01:57:51.570
I know.

3994
01:57:51.570 --> 01:57:52.110
And it's,

3995
01:57:52.110 --> 01:57:53.430
how else could you do it?

3996
01:57:53.490 --> 01:57:53.940
I mean,

3997
01:57:53.940 --> 01:57:56.100
is there enough money out there to pay everybody?

3998
01:57:56.101 --> 01:57:56.934
Well,

3999
01:57:57.240 --> 01:57:57.721
I get,

4000
01:57:57.721 --> 01:57:58.800
I got a sag pension.

4001
01:57:59.040 --> 01:58:01.160
I'll get some real money for my sag pension.

4002
01:58:01.161 --> 01:58:03.000
We could shoot an act demand screen actors guild,

4003
01:58:03.001 --> 01:58:03.330

Sexy Bitch.

4005
01:58:04.440 --> 01:58:06.210
All that time and acting class paid off kids.

4006
01:58:06.330 --> 01:58:09.860
But Ryan motherfucking kaolin with a y.

01:58:15.920 --> 01:58:17.130
