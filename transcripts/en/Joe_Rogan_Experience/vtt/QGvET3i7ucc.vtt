<v Speaker 1>I feel like I should be,</v>

9
00:00:18.271 --> 00:00:21.780
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not a ton of loot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>

10
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.370
<v Speaker 1>I said he made a ton of lewd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

11
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean since 96 when Fox News launched</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was like the big,</v>

12
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm just making it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's when Fox News launch.</v>

13
00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:32.490
<v Speaker 1>Let's check at Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that when Fox News launched 96</v>

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.370
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

15
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has pulled in so much money for that</v>

16
00:00:41.431 --> 00:00:44.280
<v Speaker 1>network and for himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was one of the bunch of bulls.</v>

17
00:00:44.281 --> 00:00:46.980
<v Speaker 1>The main guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he really was the main guy in</v>

18
00:00:46.981 --> 00:00:49.680
<v Speaker 1>broadcasting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to find another old cut to</v>

19
00:00:49.681 --> 00:00:51.360
<v Speaker 1>fill a spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have to,</v>

20
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.990
<v Speaker 1>that's what people look at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That October 7th,</v>

21
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.830
<v Speaker 1>1996,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ladies and gentlemen,</v>

22
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.830
<v Speaker 1>you'll welcome America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll wear that.</v>

23
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.170
<v Speaker 1>He was on like a hard copy or something</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

24
00:01:01.171 --> 00:01:02.340
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know.</v>

25
00:01:02.341 --> 00:01:04.710
<v Speaker 1>I was too young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't even here in the states.</v>

26
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.090
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was at school,</v>

27
00:01:06.091 --> 00:01:09.450
<v Speaker 1>child in Australia and was a child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember him from anything else.</v>

28
00:01:09.451 --> 00:01:12.930
<v Speaker 1>I just remember him being on o'reilly</v>
<v Speaker 1>and watching it and going,</v>

29
00:01:12.931 --> 00:01:16.110
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that longing for in the Stall</v>

30
00:01:16.111 --> 00:01:16.921
<v Speaker 1>Gia thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

31
00:01:16.921 --> 00:01:20.130
<v Speaker 1>you see an older gentleman in a tie who</v>
<v Speaker 1>just sit well and that's the way it is.</v>

32
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.080
<v Speaker 1>The tide goes in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tide goes out,</v>

33
00:01:22.081 --> 00:01:25.290
<v Speaker 1>can you define it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What in the fuck is this guy doing?</v>

34
00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.140
<v Speaker 1>And that was when he was talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was talking to an atheist,</v>

35
00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:28.981
<v Speaker 1>wasn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who was he?</v>

36
00:01:28.981 --> 00:01:29.551
<v Speaker 1>Was it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

37
00:01:29.551 --> 00:01:32.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like maybe it was ricky Gervais'</v>

38
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.420
<v Speaker 1>or some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember,</v>

39
00:01:33.421 --> 00:01:36.750
<v Speaker 1>but he was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe it was sam.</v>

40
00:01:36.751 --> 00:01:40.710
<v Speaker 1>Could it have been Sam Harris?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who it was somewhat.</v>

41
00:01:40.711 --> 00:01:42.990
<v Speaker 1>Some atheist was saying like a w was</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

42
00:01:42.991 --> 00:01:43.824
<v Speaker 1>what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

43
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.630
<v Speaker 1>Bill was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got the absolute number one reason</v>

44
00:01:48.631 --> 00:01:52.890
<v Speaker 1>why you have to believe in God because</v>
<v Speaker 1>tide goes in.</v>

45
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.720
<v Speaker 1>Tide goes out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>always been that way.</v>

46
00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.450
<v Speaker 1>Always will be that way when one goes</v>
<v Speaker 1>round or just spins around.</v>

47
00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.950
<v Speaker 1>How do you explain that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If not God,</v>

48
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.580
<v Speaker 1>it was just super obvious that he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>pandering because the guy went to</v>

49
00:02:02.581 --> 00:02:03.420
<v Speaker 1>fucking Harvard.</v>

50
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.950
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill O'reilly's not a dope.</v>

51
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.290
<v Speaker 1>He might be a Douche bag,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's not a dope.</v>

52
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.260
<v Speaker 1>He's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think religion makes people dopey and</v>

53
00:02:10.261 --> 00:02:12.540
<v Speaker 1>ways that they don't and they don't even</v>
<v Speaker 1>know about,</v>

54
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't even think he's religious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's barely religious.</v>

55
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.030
<v Speaker 1>I think he's religious enough to get by</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the job.</v>

56
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.330
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think he's in since he has been</v>

57
00:02:21.331 --> 00:02:24.090
<v Speaker 1>in some see 100% because I think he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the,</v>

58
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:25.740
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't watch the show a lot,</v>

59
00:02:25.741 --> 00:02:26.620
<v Speaker 1>so I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>

60
00:02:26.621 --> 00:02:28.920
<v Speaker 1>he's always struck me as one of the more</v>
<v Speaker 1>straight shooters.</v>

61
00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.120
<v Speaker 1>I think he is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's smart but not wise.</v>

62
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.350
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

63
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he feels what he feels in his gut is</v>

64
00:02:36.601 --> 00:02:38.610
<v Speaker 1>more important than what the data tells</v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

65
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.910
<v Speaker 1>And I think he falls for a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 1>fallacies that a lot of people fall for,</v>

66
00:02:41.911 --> 00:02:45.480
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're religious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the idea that there was a certain</v>

67
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.840
<v Speaker 1>order to the cosmos and how could we all</v>
<v Speaker 1>have come about?</v>

68
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.250
<v Speaker 1>How could this whole thing around us</v>
<v Speaker 1>exist with all these butterflies and the</v>

69
00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.320
<v Speaker 1>moon and the tide comes in and the tide</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes out and does his,</v>

70
00:02:55.321 --> 00:02:57.180
<v Speaker 1>me and Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these spiritual creatures,</v>

71
00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.230
<v Speaker 1>these beings sitting opposite each other</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a,</v>

72
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:00.220
<v Speaker 1>at a table</v>

73
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.880
<v Speaker 3>in Los Angeles right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people just find that to</v>

74
00:03:03.881 --> 00:03:07.210
<v Speaker 3>inexplicably to explain without a deity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they're like,</v>

75
00:03:07.211 --> 00:03:08.920
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there must've been a big guy who did it.</v>

76
00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.520
<v Speaker 4>It's even dumber in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to think that one dude engineered this</v>

77
00:03:13.521 --> 00:03:14.810
<v Speaker 4>whole fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

78
00:03:14.811 --> 00:03:16.480
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't you just think that,</v>

79
00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:19.310
<v Speaker 4>oh wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's some crazy super complex system</v>

80
00:03:19.311 --> 00:03:24.311
<v Speaker 4>that sort of works in some odd way where</v>
<v Speaker 4>it balances itself out with Predator and</v>

81
00:03:24.681 --> 00:03:29.450
<v Speaker 4>prey and food and water and fire and</v>
<v Speaker 4>dirt and all this stuff together,</v>

82
00:03:29.451 --> 00:03:32.310
<v Speaker 4>and then you realize that it all has to</v>
<v Speaker 4>form out of the the,</v>

83
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.480
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the actual elements that come from an</v>

84
00:03:35.481 --> 00:03:38.180
<v Speaker 4>exploding star.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's magnificent.</v>

85
00:03:38.181 --> 00:03:39.510
<v Speaker 4>Just the actual,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

86
00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.750
<v Speaker 4>the full realm of things that they've</v>
<v Speaker 4>absolutely proven to be true in terms of</v>

87
00:03:44.751 --> 00:03:47.350
<v Speaker 4>like scientific discoveries about the</v>
<v Speaker 4>universe and the,</v>

88
00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.620
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just the very elements that constitute</v>

89
00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:54.830
<v Speaker 4>human beings and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see this table and laptops,</v>

90
00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.440
<v Speaker 4>it's amazing the idea that one dude and</v>
<v Speaker 4>sitting there up in his class</v>

91
00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.770
<v Speaker 3>and of course moderate religious people</v>
<v Speaker 3>will say,</v>

92
00:04:02.771 --> 00:04:04.600
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course we don't believe in that kind</v>

93
00:04:04.601 --> 00:04:06.910
<v Speaker 3>of a god.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't believe in a God with a robe</v>

94
00:04:06.911 --> 00:04:10.870
<v Speaker 3>and a beard sitting in the clouds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We believe in a more sophisticated</v>

95
00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.000
<v Speaker 3>metaphorical version of God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

96
00:04:13.001 --> 00:04:18.001
<v Speaker 3>but you still believe that whatever</v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness created black holes and</v>

97
00:04:19.541 --> 00:04:24.460
<v Speaker 3>the whole cosmos gives a shit whether or</v>
<v Speaker 3>not you beat off well also that it has</v>

98
00:04:24.461 --> 00:04:26.410
<v Speaker 3>to be a one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

99
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.630
<v Speaker 3>Hey God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a thin one thing,</v>

100
00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.270
<v Speaker 3>unless you're a Hindu,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in which case I've got an elephant got</v>

101
00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:33.130
<v Speaker 3>over here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got to emission whoever.</v>

102
00:04:33.131 --> 00:04:38.131
<v Speaker 3>Here I've got a multi armed monkey</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you got a lot of Hash Hash to say</v>

103
00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.060
<v Speaker 3>those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

104
00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.510
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that's interesting is</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think at any given point in time,</v>

105
00:04:46.511 --> 00:04:51.340
<v Speaker 3>people just assumed that the universe</v>
<v Speaker 3>was created by whatever thing happens to</v>

106
00:04:51.341 --> 00:04:55.600
<v Speaker 3>be around them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was on the podcast head that that was</v>

107
00:04:55.601 --> 00:04:57.850
<v Speaker 3>a great upset.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had him on my podcast with,</v>

108
00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:58.631
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

109
00:04:58.631 --> 00:05:01.360
<v Speaker 3>I had him on point of inquiry actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a different podcast than my</v>

110
00:05:01.361 --> 00:05:04.120
<v Speaker 3>normal one where the people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the week before he was on yours,</v>

111
00:05:04.121 --> 00:05:06.100
<v Speaker 3>yours was way better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can talk about a lot of shit in</v>

112
00:05:06.101 --> 00:05:06.821
<v Speaker 3>three hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>

113
00:05:06.821 --> 00:05:08.830
<v Speaker 3>you kind of took that theme and that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>why I like doing it.</v>

114
00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:09.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Broke</v>

115
00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:14.240
<v Speaker 4>my brain with this one thing he said.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He explained that when you talk about</v>

116
00:05:14.241 --> 00:05:18.260
<v Speaker 4>the universe being 14 billion years old,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about the observable</v>

117
00:05:18.261 --> 00:05:23.261
<v Speaker 4>universe and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the problem is space moves faster than</v>

118
00:05:23.571 --> 00:05:25.880
<v Speaker 4>light.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The universe is moving faster than the</v>

119
00:05:25.881 --> 00:05:30.860
<v Speaker 4>speed of light.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what we're seeing is what we can see</v>

120
00:05:30.861 --> 00:05:33.800
<v Speaker 4>from 14 billion years ago because,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that doesn't mean that's all there</v>

121
00:05:33.801 --> 00:05:34.580
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

122
00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.460
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>space itself is bending.</v>

123
00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.940
<v Speaker 4>But what he's saying is space itself</v>
<v Speaker 4>beyond that could be infinite.</v>

124
00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.740
<v Speaker 4>It's just moving faster than we can see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just spread my brain.</v>

125
00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:46.581
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

126
00:05:46.581 --> 00:05:47.271
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he was saying,</v>

127
00:05:47.271 --> 00:05:49.550
<v Speaker 4>it's like when you're talking about the</v>
<v Speaker 4>observable universe being,</v>

128
00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:53.720
<v Speaker 4>I think it's 13.7 billion years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>almost 14 billion years old.</v>

129
00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.080
<v Speaker 4>That's just how far back we can see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

130
00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.050
<v Speaker 4>but before that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like when you go back further.</v>

131
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:02.960
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's right.</v>

132
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:08.000
<v Speaker 4>It's just that we can't see it because</v>
<v Speaker 4>the space itself is moving faster than</v>

133
00:06:08.001 --> 00:06:09.350
<v Speaker 4>the speed of light.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

134
00:06:09.351 --> 00:06:11.330
<v Speaker 4>And you're also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you're looking at is not only the</v>

135
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.970
<v Speaker 4>edge of the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the edge of time.</v>

136
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:15.740
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because it's not even the edge.</v>

137
00:06:15.741 --> 00:06:20.240
<v Speaker 4>What he's saying is it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very likely that not only is it</v>

138
00:06:20.241 --> 00:06:22.130
<v Speaker 4>infinite,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's an infinite number of</v>

139
00:06:22.131 --> 00:06:24.410
<v Speaker 4>possibilities beyond it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

140
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:27.920
<v Speaker 4>And those things beyond it may also be</v>
<v Speaker 4>right alongside us.</v>

141
00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:29.870
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in terms of the other dimensions and</v>

142
00:06:29.871 --> 00:06:31.920
<v Speaker 4>things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like he didn't even get into all of it,</v>

143
00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.580
<v Speaker 4>all of that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you believe in string theory and</v>

144
00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:37.040
<v Speaker 4>quantum physics and if you believe in</v>
<v Speaker 4>math,</v>

145
00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:41.390
<v Speaker 4>then you sort of have to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well quantum physics and string theory</v>

146
00:06:41.391 --> 00:06:44.600
<v Speaker 4>to a dope like me is one of those things</v>
<v Speaker 4>where I have to contact your word for</v>

147
00:06:44.601 --> 00:06:44.660
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

148
00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:47.240
<v Speaker 4>It's almost like before the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

149
00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:51.320
<v Speaker 4>before the Lutheran Times,</v>
<v Speaker 4>before the Bible was translated and you</v>

150
00:06:51.321 --> 00:06:53.060
<v Speaker 4>have to rely on the priest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just trust the price.</v>

151
00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:57.440
<v Speaker 4>I'll just you and your knowledge cause</v>
<v Speaker 4>he knows Latin and he speaks Aramaic.</v>

152
00:06:57.441 --> 00:06:59.030
<v Speaker 4>You know it's going to read this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

153
00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.400
<v Speaker 4>Who told the priest?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well the pope who told the Pope don't</v>

154
00:07:01.401 --> 00:07:03.680
<v Speaker 4>ask questions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when you go into this food,</v>

155
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:07.430
<v Speaker 4>that's why it's so important to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to appreciate like when people are</v>

156
00:07:07.431 --> 00:07:10.850
<v Speaker 4>science deniers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so frustrating because everything</v>

157
00:07:10.851 --> 00:07:13.460
<v Speaker 4>you use,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything you enjoy,</v>

158
00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:16.070
<v Speaker 4>everything that you in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 4>medicine,</v>

159
00:07:16.071 --> 00:07:21.071
<v Speaker 4>technology is based on the work of</v>
<v Speaker 4>countless people who have worked</v>

160
00:07:21.111 --> 00:07:24.530
<v Speaker 4>generations after generations on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>innovations of the past.</v>

161
00:07:24.531 --> 00:07:27.380
<v Speaker 4>Like the people before them invented</v>
<v Speaker 4>some shit.</v>

162
00:07:27.381 --> 00:07:29.690
<v Speaker 4>They improved upon it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They figured out more.</v>

163
00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.060
<v Speaker 4>They studied the calculations of those</v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

164
00:07:32.061 --> 00:07:35.240
<v Speaker 4>they added to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you get to 2017 so whenever</v>

165
00:07:35.241 --> 00:07:39.920
<v Speaker 4>someone steps in with an incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 4>limited understanding of science or of</v>

166
00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:41.840
<v Speaker 4>what we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what we're dealing with in terms of the</v>

167
00:07:41.841 --> 00:07:43.160
<v Speaker 4>universe itself and says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>

168
00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:44.870
<v Speaker 4>tide goes in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the tide goes out.</v>

169
00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.150
<v Speaker 4>You can't explain it like you mother</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucker.</v>

170
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:49.130
<v Speaker 4>They've been explaining the tides</v>
<v Speaker 4>forever.</v>

171
00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:52.780
<v Speaker 4>What are you talking about you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think what he actually means is Yukon.</v>

172
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:56.780
<v Speaker 4>Explain why there is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why there is something instead of total</v>

173
00:07:56.781 --> 00:08:01.060
<v Speaker 4>chaos and anarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you can get sold credit.</v>

174
00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:02.930
<v Speaker 4>He's a douchebag.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>

175
00:08:02.931 --> 00:08:05.330
<v Speaker 4>I think he's pandering.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he was just trying to,</v>

176
00:08:05.331 --> 00:08:08.000
<v Speaker 4>I think he knows there's a bunch of old</v>
<v Speaker 4>dummies out there,</v>

177
00:08:08.001 --> 00:08:09.560
<v Speaker 4>crocheting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

178
00:08:09.561 --> 00:08:12.260
<v Speaker 4>with three teeth listening to his stupid</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking shit.</v>

179
00:08:12.261 --> 00:08:14.840
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that you can be highly</v>
<v Speaker 4>intelligent and religious.</v>

180
00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:19.490
<v Speaker 4>Yes you can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you highly effective at individual</v>

181
00:08:19.491 --> 00:08:21.840
<v Speaker 4>pursuits.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now when you talk,</v>

182
00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:25.910
<v Speaker 4>when you say highly intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as soon as soon as someone is religious</v>

183
00:08:25.911 --> 00:08:28.910
<v Speaker 4>in terms of like if you believe in</v>
<v Speaker 4>preposterous notions,</v>

184
00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:31.070
<v Speaker 4>like there's a guy who came back to</v>
<v Speaker 4>life,</v>

185
00:08:31.071 --> 00:08:33.320
<v Speaker 4>he turns water into wine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he walks on water.</v>

186
00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:36.020
<v Speaker 4>If you believe that you're not</v>
<v Speaker 4>intelligent,</v>

187
00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:39.350
<v Speaker 4>you're just not well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't believe you're intelligent.</v>

188
00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:42.770
<v Speaker 4>I think you are intelligent in</v>
<v Speaker 4>individual disciplines,</v>

189
00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:45.950
<v Speaker 4>but obviously if you believe something</v>
<v Speaker 4>that makes no sense whatsoever,</v>

190
00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:49.790
<v Speaker 4>you believe that someone was magic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Someone defied physics.</v>

191
00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:53.540
<v Speaker 4>Someone had superpowers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Someone was a person who could bring</v>

192
00:08:53.541 --> 00:08:55.950
<v Speaker 4>people back to life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Someone could come back to life</v>

193
00:08:55.951 --> 00:08:56.670
<v Speaker 4>themselves.</v>

194
00:08:56.670 --> 00:09:01.670
<v Speaker 5>There's no evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You believe this on the flimsiest</v>

195
00:09:01.711 --> 00:09:05.250
<v Speaker 5>fucking evidence that wasn't even</v>
<v Speaker 5>written down until 70 or 80 years after</v>

196
00:09:05.251 --> 00:09:10.251
<v Speaker 5>that dude died because Christianity</v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't even so been worse than that</v>

197
00:09:10.501 --> 00:09:14.860
<v Speaker 5>because the old testament is far older</v>
<v Speaker 5>than totally notion of Jesus,</v>

198
00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:16.830
<v Speaker 5>but that's not it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hang on,</v>

199
00:09:16.831 --> 00:09:19.020
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do quibble with the idea that this,</v>

200
00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:22.560
<v Speaker 5>that you can't be smart.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Stephen Colbert was one of the smartest,</v>

201
00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:25.490
<v Speaker 5>the word smart.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is what the problem is like would</v>

202
00:09:25.491 --> 00:09:27.060
<v Speaker 5>define smart,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what you believe.</v>

203
00:09:27.061 --> 00:09:28.200
<v Speaker 5>Stupid Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are you smart?</v>

204
00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:32.100
<v Speaker 5>You are implying that the reason why</v>
<v Speaker 5>bill o'reilly talks about tide goes in</v>

205
00:09:32.101 --> 00:09:35.400
<v Speaker 5>tide goes out is because he's pandering</v>
<v Speaker 5>to people because he's,</v>

206
00:09:35.401 --> 00:09:38.220
<v Speaker 5>he's a Harvard guy and there's no way</v>
<v Speaker 5>that he would be dumb enough to believe</v>

207
00:09:38.221 --> 00:09:38.970
<v Speaker 5>that no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

208
00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:41.280
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm complying that because I looked at</v>

209
00:09:41.281 --> 00:09:44.610
<v Speaker 5>the way he said it and I know what he</v>
<v Speaker 5>does and I think he's manipulative and I</v>

210
00:09:44.611 --> 00:09:47.100
<v Speaker 5>think what he's doing is playing to his</v>
<v Speaker 5>base.</v>

211
00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:51.180
<v Speaker 5>I think there's a lot of people out</v>
<v Speaker 5>there that want to see some smug liberal</v>

212
00:09:51.181 --> 00:09:54.900
<v Speaker 5>atheist get taken down a notch and bill</v>
<v Speaker 5>just the guy to do it and talk over him</v>

213
00:09:54.901 --> 00:09:57.900
<v Speaker 5>and he's a big giant guys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can yell and get all aggressive.</v>

214
00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:00.310
<v Speaker 5>We went on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't understand is like steven called</v>

215
00:10:00.311 --> 00:10:03.420
<v Speaker 5>Bay is obviously a very smart guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's a Catholic.</v>

216
00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:05.310
<v Speaker 5>Andrew Sullivan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know if you know him,</v>

217
00:10:05.311 --> 00:10:08.640
<v Speaker 5>the blogger a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's a friend of Sam Harris's like he's</v>

218
00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:12.540
<v Speaker 5>a Christian and good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These people find ways of</v>

219
00:10:12.541 --> 00:10:15.960
<v Speaker 5>compartmentalizing logic I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So like as you say,</v>

220
00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:18.150
<v Speaker 5>they believe in something that is</v>
<v Speaker 5>totally crazy.</v>

221
00:10:18.151 --> 00:10:21.630
<v Speaker 5>I mean the idea that you can say a</v>
<v Speaker 5>certain number of Latin words over a</v>

222
00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:25.350
<v Speaker 5>over a cracker and it'll turn bodily</v>
<v Speaker 5>into the flesh of someone who existed</v>

223
00:10:25.351 --> 00:10:28.440
<v Speaker 5>2000 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy magic talk.</v>

224
00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:29.340
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's crazy talk,</v>

225
00:10:29.341 --> 00:10:32.670
<v Speaker 5>but there are people that are religious</v>
<v Speaker 5>that are extremely intelligent and I</v>

226
00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:33.660
<v Speaker 5>agree with you on this.</v>

227
00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:37.680
<v Speaker 5>Like Jordan Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who's a brilliant man who is very</v>

228
00:10:37.681 --> 00:10:41.250
<v Speaker 5>religious in the sense that he studies</v>
<v Speaker 5>religion and he believes there's some</v>

229
00:10:41.251 --> 00:10:46.170
<v Speaker 5>fundamental principles that are involved</v>
<v Speaker 5>in religion that are in extra bowl to</v>

230
00:10:46.171 --> 00:10:49.320
<v Speaker 5>the human condition.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think he think he thinks they're</v>

231
00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:53.820
<v Speaker 5>important to our society and to civility</v>
<v Speaker 5>and ethics and morals.</v>

232
00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:56.640
<v Speaker 5>I don't think he believes people walked</v>
<v Speaker 5>on water.</v>

233
00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:59.010
<v Speaker 5>I don't think he believed someone came</v>
<v Speaker 5>back from the dead.</v>

234
00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:03.360
<v Speaker 5>I don't think he believes this stupid</v>
<v Speaker 5>shit and I don't think the stupid shit</v>

235
00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:08.690
<v Speaker 5>is even the original story.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The huge problem with religion is</v>

236
00:11:08.821 --> 00:11:11.820
<v Speaker 5>translation over time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's one of the biggest problems.</v>

237
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.020
<v Speaker 5>The oldest version of the Bible that we</v>
<v Speaker 5>know of is the Dead Sea Scrolls.</v>

238
00:11:16.021 --> 00:11:19.860
<v Speaker 5>They don't even use that because it's so</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking crazy.</v>

239
00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:22.950
<v Speaker 5>If you listen to some of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>translations of the Dead Sea Scrolls,</v>

240
00:11:22.951 --> 00:11:25.380
<v Speaker 5>are you read?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some of it is unbelievably crazy.</v>

241
00:11:25.381 --> 00:11:27.480
<v Speaker 5>I mean it sounds like science fiction</v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff.</v>

242
00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:31.800
<v Speaker 5>And if you go back to that version of</v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

243
00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:34.410
<v Speaker 5>I mean you're talking about stuff that</v>
<v Speaker 5>was written on animal skins.</v>

244
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:35.550
<v Speaker 5>They used to do they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

245
00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:39.960
<v Speaker 5>they did DNA tests to make sure that the</v>
<v Speaker 5>pieces that they got,</v>

246
00:11:39.961 --> 00:11:41.490
<v Speaker 5>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know the whole story behind the Dead</v>

247
00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:44.800
<v Speaker 5>Sea scrolls basically,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you found them in Cobra on the</v>

248
00:11:44.801 --> 00:11:48.720
<v Speaker 5>scrolls were written on animal skin.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the,</v>

249
00:11:48.721 --> 00:11:51.150
<v Speaker 5>they were broken up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the piece them back together,</v>

250
00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:53.980
<v Speaker 5>they had to do DNA testing to make sure</v>
<v Speaker 5>that the piece</v>

251
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:57.430
<v Speaker 4>of skin came from the same cow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then they had to try to figure out,</v>

252
00:11:57.431 --> 00:11:58.990
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where does all this shit go?</v>

253
00:11:58.991 --> 00:12:00.940
<v Speaker 4>And then how to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how to put it into place.</v>

254
00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:02.920
<v Speaker 4>But they don't even use that version of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Bible.</v>

255
00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:05.260
<v Speaker 4>And even if you use the Old Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people say,</v>

256
00:12:05.261 --> 00:12:07.300
<v Speaker 4>well that's the Old Testament.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't really,</v>

257
00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:10.270
<v Speaker 4>we go by the New Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is even more preposterous because</v>

258
00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:14.140
<v Speaker 4>the new testament was written by</v>
<v Speaker 4>Constantine and a bunch of bishops and</v>

259
00:12:14.141 --> 00:12:17.650
<v Speaker 4>men decided what to leave in and what to</v>
<v Speaker 4>take out.</v>

260
00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:18.260
<v Speaker 4>They decided</v>

261
00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.370
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that the whole chunks of it a</v>

262
00:12:20.371 --> 00:12:24.050
<v Speaker 1>contradictory as true as well as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bible,</v>

263
00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:25.590
<v Speaker 4>but I mean we're just talking about the</v>
<v Speaker 4>bio for now.</v>

264
00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:29.400
<v Speaker 4>Constantine wasn't even religious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean Constantine wasn't even a</v>

265
00:12:29.401 --> 00:12:32.800
<v Speaker 4>Christian until he died.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was converted on his fucking death</v>

266
00:12:32.801 --> 00:12:34.830
<v Speaker 4>bed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he just did it so that he could</v>

267
00:12:34.831 --> 00:12:36.960
<v Speaker 4>unite Rome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He knew what the fuck he was doing.</v>

268
00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:38.610
<v Speaker 4>He was getting all these people to</v>
<v Speaker 4>operate together.</v>

269
00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:40.650
<v Speaker 4>Does this mean there's No God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>absolutely not.</v>

270
00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:42.660
<v Speaker 4>Does this mean that I have in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>answers that you don't have?</v>

271
00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:46.650
<v Speaker 4>Of course not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just saying people are full of Shit</v>

272
00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:47.940
<v Speaker 4>and that story sucks.</v>

273
00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:49.380
<v Speaker 1>It's that simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why they may.</v>

274
00:12:49.381 --> 00:12:51.480
<v Speaker 1>I think what we do too much of is</v>
<v Speaker 1>confusing.</v>

275
00:12:51.481 --> 00:12:53.400
<v Speaker 1>Two questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of which is,</v>

276
00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:57.780
<v Speaker 1>is there a god without defining what God</v>
<v Speaker 1>is and the other of which is,</v>

277
00:12:57.990 --> 00:13:02.190
<v Speaker 1>is there any reason to believe in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>particular faith or a particular</v>

278
00:13:02.191 --> 00:13:05.850
<v Speaker 1>denomination to be a Christian or a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Muslim or a Jew or whatever</v>

279
00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:09.290
<v Speaker 4>done in further than that people don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>know.</v>

280
00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:12.710
<v Speaker 4>And anyone who says they know that's not</v>
<v Speaker 4>telling the truth.</v>

281
00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:14.300
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're not talking about,</v>

282
00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:17.870
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we do know that carbon comes from stars</v>

283
00:13:17.871 --> 00:13:18.410
<v Speaker 4>when they explode.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

284
00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:21.140
<v Speaker 4>Well that can be scientifically</v>
<v Speaker 4>explained and proven.</v>

285
00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:23.390
<v Speaker 4>We're not talking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're talking about,</v>

286
00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:28.540
<v Speaker 4>do you know whether or not Jesus was a</v>
<v Speaker 4>man who came back from the dead and turn</v>

287
00:13:28.881 --> 00:13:31.000
<v Speaker 4>water into what you do not know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>One</v>

288
00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:34.340
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know with as much certainty that he</v>

289
00:13:34.341 --> 00:13:37.250
<v Speaker 1>didn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anything about the past.</v>

290
00:13:37.251 --> 00:13:38.930
<v Speaker 1>But you don't hear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You honestly don't.</v>

291
00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:40.093
<v Speaker 1>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

292
00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:41.720
<v Speaker 1>how do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you know what Napoleon did?</v>

293
00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:44.840
<v Speaker 1>You don't write well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know historical records.</v>

294
00:13:44.841 --> 00:13:46.850
<v Speaker 1>We know the stories of people from back</v>
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>

295
00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:48.680
<v Speaker 1>but the idea that</v>

296
00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:53.520
<v Speaker 4>this one guy did things that no human</v>
<v Speaker 4>being could ever do today.</v>

297
00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.620
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Defied logic,</v>

298
00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:57.420
<v Speaker 4>physics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the laws of nature,</v>

299
00:13:57.421 --> 00:14:00.570
<v Speaker 4>the laws of life and death,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the different reality.</v>

300
00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:05.190
<v Speaker 4>The reality is that we accept today in</v>
<v Speaker 4>terms of what's provable,</v>

301
00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:09.510
<v Speaker 4>what we know about biological life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All that stuff was violated by this one</v>

302
00:14:09.511 --> 00:14:10.344
<v Speaker 4>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

303
00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:11.870
<v Speaker 1>Could have happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They could have,</v>

304
00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:15.020
<v Speaker 1>it could have in the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like close might not have happened.</v>

305
00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:18.380
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's way less likely than that.</v>

306
00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:21.590
<v Speaker 1>You reckon it's more likely that Jesus</v>
<v Speaker 1>was divine?</v>

307
00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:23.540
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The opposite.</v>

308
00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:27.830
<v Speaker 1>It's way more likely to called the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holocaust didn't happen then that Jesus</v>

309
00:14:27.831 --> 00:14:30.590
<v Speaker 1>did all of that shit and I think the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holocaust is 100% real.</v>

310
00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:32.090
<v Speaker 1>He sounds like me too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>

311
00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:35.870
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of my point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a religious people put an undue</v>

312
00:14:35.871 --> 00:14:39.050
<v Speaker 1>burden on on nonreligious people by</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

313
00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:40.630
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's to say?</v>

314
00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:42.530
<v Speaker 1>I say there's a God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You say there's not a god,</v>

315
00:14:42.531 --> 00:14:45.050
<v Speaker 1>it's a 50 50 toss up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to believe in Christian.</v>

316
00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:47.360
<v Speaker 1>I've heard call bear say this to Bill</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maher on his show.</v>

317
00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:49.100
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a Christian.</v>

318
00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:52.190
<v Speaker 1>I've got nothing to lose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I turn out to be right</v>

319
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:55.370
<v Speaker 3>and Christianity is true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoop de do I get to go to heaven?</v>

320
00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:57.590
<v Speaker 3>If I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it turns out that Christianity is</v>

321
00:14:57.591 --> 00:14:59.780
<v Speaker 3>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I just die.</v>

322
00:14:59.781 --> 00:15:01.640
<v Speaker 3>But at least you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>give it a chance.</v>

323
00:15:01.641 --> 00:15:03.170
<v Speaker 3>This is Pascal's wager,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

324
00:15:03.171 --> 00:15:06.800
<v Speaker 3>This is this idea that you might as well</v>
<v Speaker 3>be religious because hey,</v>

325
00:15:06.801 --> 00:15:09.530
<v Speaker 3>if it's true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got an attorney of goodness,</v>

326
00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:10.980
<v Speaker 3>but here's the thing and you avoid hell</v>
<v Speaker 3>fire.</v>

327
00:15:10.981 --> 00:15:11.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

328
00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:16.130
<v Speaker 4>Can't be true because no one knows like</v>
<v Speaker 4>no one has died and giving you the debt.</v>

329
00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:21.500
<v Speaker 4>No one's died with a VCR or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a vhs tape recorder and comeback with a</v>

330
00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:23.700
<v Speaker 4>knock here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>put this in the machine and play it.</v>

331
00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:25.080
<v Speaker 4>This is heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've shown you,</v>

332
00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:27.690
<v Speaker 3>but it's not even a 50 50 shot is what</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying.</v>

333
00:15:27.691 --> 00:15:30.690
<v Speaker 3>It's not like black.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bertrand Russell kind of demolished this</v>

334
00:15:30.691 --> 00:15:33.390
<v Speaker 3>idea with his teapot analogy where he</v>
<v Speaker 3>said like,</v>

335
00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:35.910
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to claim that there's a teapot</v>

336
00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:39.330
<v Speaker 3>circling in orbit between the Earth and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the moon,</v>

337
00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:43.290
<v Speaker 3>and now if you deny that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then hey,</v>

338
00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:46.200
<v Speaker 3>it's just a 50 50 shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's there.</v>

339
00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:47.940
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's not there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who's to say,</v>

340
00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:49.560
<v Speaker 3>obviously you would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

341
00:15:49.561 --> 00:15:51.810
<v Speaker 3>I think it's not there because if</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no evidence that it's there,</v>

342
00:15:51.811 --> 00:15:53.640
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to just going to believe</v>
<v Speaker 3>you because you say it.</v>

343
00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:55.530
<v Speaker 3>And similarly if you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

344
00:15:55.531 --> 00:15:56.400
<v Speaker 3>this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus,</v>

345
00:15:56.610 --> 00:15:58.800
<v Speaker 3>2000 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he turned water into wine.</v>

346
00:15:58.801 --> 00:16:02.160
<v Speaker 3>He walked on water and then he was the</v>
<v Speaker 3>son of God and that God requires you to</v>

347
00:16:02.161 --> 00:16:04.350
<v Speaker 3>believe on him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise you're going to go to hell</v>

348
00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:06.360
<v Speaker 3>forever and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why should I believe that?</v>

349
00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:08.100
<v Speaker 3>And they can't turn around and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

350
00:16:08.101 --> 00:16:10.500
<v Speaker 3>it's a 50 50 shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a 50 50 shot.</v>

351
00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:13.140
<v Speaker 3>There are good reasons for believing</v>
<v Speaker 3>things and bad reasons for believing</v>

352
00:16:13.141 --> 00:16:16.980
<v Speaker 3>things and religion almost always only</v>
<v Speaker 3>offered bad reasons for believing in it.</v>

353
00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:18.820
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as soon as you start talking numbers,</v>

354
00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:22.000
<v Speaker 4>percentages and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you're just making those numbers</v>

355
00:16:22.001 --> 00:16:22.510
<v Speaker 4>up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

356
00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:26.770
<v Speaker 4>50 50 where are you coming up with that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How about a 50 50 shot?</v>

357
00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:30.360
<v Speaker 4>This is vegas odds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what is this little group?</v>

358
00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:31.790
<v Speaker 4>A lot of religious people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't mean,</v>

359
00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:33.370
<v Speaker 4>here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If people are listening to your getting</v>

360
00:16:33.371 --> 00:16:35.650
<v Speaker 4>fucking pissed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't mean there's not a higher</v>

361
00:16:35.651 --> 00:16:37.450
<v Speaker 4>power.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't mean it's not an order to</v>

362
00:16:37.451 --> 00:16:42.130
<v Speaker 4>this university signs that it's super</v>
<v Speaker 4>likely that if there is something that's</v>

363
00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:47.460
<v Speaker 4>unbelievably powerful and there's some</v>
<v Speaker 4>law that keeps the universe together and</v>

364
00:16:47.741 --> 00:16:51.430
<v Speaker 4>some force of good that's trying to</v>
<v Speaker 4>guide us in this.</v>

365
00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:54.040
<v Speaker 4>There's some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know there's some beautiful</v>

366
00:16:54.041 --> 00:16:58.990
<v Speaker 4>inclinations towards that direction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What I'm saying is I guarantee you that</v>

367
00:16:58.991 --> 00:17:03.991
<v Speaker 4>the people who lived 2000 years ago who</v>
<v Speaker 4>wrote this shit down on leather with you</v>

368
00:17:05.571 --> 00:17:06.970
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ink that they met at a plant,</v>

369
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.410
<v Speaker 4>they didn't have all the data.</v>

370
00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:10.690
<v Speaker 4>They just didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just didn't,</v>

371
00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:14.530
<v Speaker 4>they didn't know July theory of disease.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean they didn't even know that the</v>

372
00:17:14.610 --> 00:17:18.790
<v Speaker 4>Earth's spinning around the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He showed the people who understood the</v>

373
00:17:18.791 --> 00:17:21.830
<v Speaker 4>most about the cosmos or some shit</v>
<v Speaker 4>today.</v>

374
00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:24.370
<v Speaker 4>I mean the reason why they didn't want</v>
<v Speaker 4>any pork is because they figured out</v>

375
00:17:24.371 --> 00:17:25.330
<v Speaker 4>trick analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>

376
00:17:25.331 --> 00:17:27.190
<v Speaker 4>oh listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you need these fucking pigs,</v>

377
00:17:27.191 --> 00:17:28.630
<v Speaker 4>ma'am,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kimber getting sick left and really got</v>

378
00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:30.730
<v Speaker 4>to stop doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As for those things that crawl off on</v>

379
00:17:30.731 --> 00:17:32.100
<v Speaker 4>the bottom of the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

380
00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:33.610
<v Speaker 4>Give me any of that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

381
00:17:33.611 --> 00:17:35.560
<v Speaker 4>Well the got hooked up with red tide.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>

382
00:17:35.561 --> 00:17:35.920
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

383
00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:37.460
<v Speaker 4>we're dying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've got to stop eating shell fish.</v>

384
00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:41.830
<v Speaker 4>And there's a lot of like real logic to</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Wa the the reasons why they had laws</v>

385
00:17:41.831 --> 00:17:44.560
<v Speaker 4>and it makes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>makes sense.</v>

386
00:17:44.561 --> 00:17:47.950
<v Speaker 4>But the real issue again is the</v>
<v Speaker 4>translation.</v>

387
00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:50.040
<v Speaker 4>It was that the ancient Hebrew</v>

388
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:52.950
<v Speaker 5>version of the Bible,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ancient Hebrew,</v>

389
00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:58.220
<v Speaker 5>the words also double as numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like do you know that letters or numbers</v>

390
00:17:58.381 --> 00:17:59.870
<v Speaker 5>in ancient Hebrew,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

391
00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:01.680
<v Speaker 5>Their alphabet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't have numbers.</v>

392
00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:05.820
<v Speaker 5>So the letter a is also the number one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So words have numerical value,</v>

393
00:18:05.821 --> 00:18:09.420
<v Speaker 5>like the word God and the word love,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have the same numerical value.</v>

394
00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:12.870
<v Speaker 5>All that was lost in translation when</v>
<v Speaker 5>you translated to Latin,</v>

395
00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:14.790
<v Speaker 5>Greek,</v>
<v Speaker 5>eventually English,</v>

396
00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:17.180
<v Speaker 5>all that Shit was lost.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it's the,</v>

397
00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:21.090
<v Speaker 5>the ancient Hebrew version of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if you ever read like some really</v>

398
00:18:21.091 --> 00:18:23.930
<v Speaker 5>goofy translation of English,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Japanese.</v>

399
00:18:23.931 --> 00:18:24.810
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you're like,</v>

400
00:18:24.811 --> 00:18:28.260
<v Speaker 5>what in the fuck are they saying?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Or if you translated English into a</v>

401
00:18:28.261 --> 00:18:31.140
<v Speaker 5>foreign language and then translate it</v>
<v Speaker 5>back from that foreign language into</v>

402
00:18:31.141 --> 00:18:32.940
<v Speaker 5>English,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if it comes jibberish.</v>

403
00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:35.700
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the things I love about instagram</v>

404
00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:38.880
<v Speaker 5>is it has a translation thing that I use</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of times that follow out of</v>

405
00:18:38.881 --> 00:18:39.840
<v Speaker 5>Russian fighters.</v>

406
00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:44.160
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of a Russian MMA fighters</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I follow their pages and I'll go,</v>

407
00:18:44.161 --> 00:18:45.950
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's hit the translate and now hit</v>

408
00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:46.621
<v Speaker 5>translate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

409
00:18:46.621 --> 00:18:49.260
<v Speaker 5>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it seems especially hard for some</v>

410
00:18:49.261 --> 00:18:50.120
<v Speaker 5>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's got to lead.</v>

411
00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:52.680
<v Speaker 5>We had pronouns and things are always</v>
<v Speaker 5>saying good.</v>

412
00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:55.920
<v Speaker 5>This is the best fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The well,</v>

413
00:18:55.921 --> 00:18:58.470
<v Speaker 5>it's also like their language looks</v>
<v Speaker 5>different.</v>

414
00:18:58.500 --> 00:18:58.891
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

415
00:18:58.891 --> 00:19:01.560
<v Speaker 5>it's totally in cyrillic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you had the,</v>

416
00:19:01.561 --> 00:19:04.530
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the claim that the 72 virgins in the</v>

417
00:19:04.531 --> 00:19:07.470
<v Speaker 5>Koran or actually 72 raisins,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

418
00:19:07.471 --> 00:19:10.740
<v Speaker 5>but you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That wood is almost the same between</v>

419
00:19:10.741 --> 00:19:12.390
<v Speaker 5>reason and virgin.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

420
00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:16.800
<v Speaker 5>the expression 72 is like a fuck load.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what it means.</v>

421
00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:21.090
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't mean 72 virgins,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it means like there'll be 72 and</v>

422
00:19:21.091 --> 00:19:21.751
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

423
00:19:21.751 --> 00:19:22.980
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's enough.</v>

424
00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:23.910
<v Speaker 5>That's enough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're good.</v>

425
00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:27.180
<v Speaker 5>I would not need more than 72 virgins or</v>
<v Speaker 5>raisins.</v>

426
00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:28.860
<v Speaker 5>It's to help me happy bringing them to</v>
<v Speaker 5>life.</v>

427
00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:32.850
<v Speaker 5>It's probably not even the number 72</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just like our translation from</v>

428
00:19:32.851 --> 00:19:36.510
<v Speaker 5>Arabic to English to screws it up and</v>
<v Speaker 5>then someone probably came up with this</v>

429
00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:41.280
<v Speaker 5>numerical value a long time ago and they</v>
<v Speaker 5>stuck with 72 so I believe in science,</v>

430
00:19:41.281 --> 00:19:43.170
<v Speaker 5>paypal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So talking about bill o'reilly,</v>

431
00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:47.040
<v Speaker 5>do you think he should have been fired?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what he did and I know I</v>

432
00:19:47.041 --> 00:19:48.180
<v Speaker 5>don't know what he didn't do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

433
00:19:48.181 --> 00:19:50.000
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know he's definitely done some gross</v>

434
00:19:50.001 --> 00:19:53.580
<v Speaker 5>shit in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like there's the audio of him calling</v>

435
00:19:53.581 --> 00:19:57.430
<v Speaker 5>that check and say he's going to take a</v>
<v Speaker 5>loofa sponge Loofah,</v>

436
00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:00.900
<v Speaker 5>big,</v>
<v Speaker 5>big olive bill with his luther in the</v>

437
00:20:00.901 --> 00:20:01.800
<v Speaker 5>shower.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

438
00:20:01.801 --> 00:20:02.850
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who knows?</v>

439
00:20:02.851 --> 00:20:06.240
<v Speaker 5>I would imagine whenever you hear a</v>
<v Speaker 5>story about a guy like that,</v>

440
00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:08.520
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some of it is probably fabricated.</v>

441
00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:11.430
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just don't imagine that all the people</v>

442
00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:15.180
<v Speaker 5>that say things about him or all telling</v>
<v Speaker 5>the 100% truth,</v>

443
00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:16.050
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't matter.</v>

444
00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:18.760
<v Speaker 5>Imagine that would be true because</v>
<v Speaker 5>people are just not like,</v>

445
00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:22.440
<v Speaker 5>once it gets beyond a few paypal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then you think that the preponderance of</v>

446
00:20:22.441 --> 00:20:24.330
<v Speaker 5>evidence is that they're probably,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

447
00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:25.890
<v Speaker 5>I guess you can't say they're all</v>
<v Speaker 5>telling the truth,</v>

448
00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:28.020
<v Speaker 5>but it's hard to take their word for it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

449
00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:29.250
<v Speaker 5>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You definitely don't.</v>

450
00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:30.600
<v Speaker 5>If they're a six,</v>
<v Speaker 5>seven,</v>

451
00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:32.300
<v Speaker 5>eight people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>definitely stories.</v>

452
00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:33.500
<v Speaker 5>You definitely have to go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hmm.</v>

453
00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:37.710
<v Speaker 5>But you don't have to take all their</v>
<v Speaker 5>word for it because first of all,</v>

454
00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:39.870
<v Speaker 5>you don't know those people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You'd have to know those people.</v>

455
00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:42.960
<v Speaker 5>You'd have to really know if they were</v>
<v Speaker 5>honest.</v>

456
00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:47.980
<v Speaker 5>You'd have to really be there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got to to know what really is so</v>

457
00:20:47.981 --> 00:20:50.260
<v Speaker 5>fucking hard man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because first of all,</v>

458
00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:52.240
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not only are they full of shit,</v>

459
00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:55.120
<v Speaker 5>but their memory sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People's memories.</v>

460
00:20:55.121 --> 00:20:57.130
<v Speaker 5>Like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure you've had a conversation with</v>

461
00:20:57.131 --> 00:21:00.250
<v Speaker 5>someone about something that happened</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you witnessed as well and you both</v>

462
00:21:00.251 --> 00:21:02.760
<v Speaker 5>have totally different memories of</v>
<v Speaker 5>memories that terrible.</v>

463
00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:06.580
<v Speaker 5>But I've come to accept that though for</v>
<v Speaker 5>myself over the last few years,</v>

464
00:21:06.581 --> 00:21:09.940
<v Speaker 5>like I used to like clean the memories</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then try to argue them.</v>

465
00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:15.150
<v Speaker 5>But I think it's been scientifically</v>
<v Speaker 5>proven that the human memory is one of</v>

466
00:21:16.091 --> 00:21:18.940
<v Speaker 5>the worst pieces of evidence that you</v>
<v Speaker 5>could ever call upon.</v>

467
00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:20.590
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The justice system is dining to de</v>

468
00:21:20.591 --> 00:21:23.770
<v Speaker 5>prioritize it as well as it should do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because in the past,</v>

469
00:21:23.771 --> 00:21:25.830
<v Speaker 5>like I witnessed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

470
00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:29.340
<v Speaker 5>accounts in courtrooms have been very</v>
<v Speaker 5>highly prioritized.</v>

471
00:21:29.341 --> 00:21:32.110
<v Speaker 5>Like they'd been very highly valued and</v>
<v Speaker 5>prized by prosecutors.</v>

472
00:21:32.111 --> 00:21:32.501
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

473
00:21:32.501 --> 00:21:34.720
<v Speaker 5>I mean this person points out the WHO</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the,</v>

474
00:21:34.721 --> 00:21:36.610
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you see that person sitting in the</v>

475
00:21:36.611 --> 00:21:37.790
<v Speaker 5>courtroom today,</v>
<v Speaker 5>madam?</v>

476
00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:39.790
<v Speaker 5>And she points their finger and well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a slam dunk.</v>

477
00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:42.900
<v Speaker 5>Of course that was the perpetrator.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now we realize people are memories all</v>

478
00:21:42.901 --> 00:21:47.140
<v Speaker 5>the terrible and wrong all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're really susceptible to suggestion</v>

479
00:21:47.141 --> 00:21:48.790
<v Speaker 5>and influence and all that sort of</v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff.</v>

480
00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:53.260
<v Speaker 5>But I think you kind of remember whether</v>
<v Speaker 5>or not your boss who's a television star</v>

481
00:21:53.261 --> 00:21:55.210
<v Speaker 5>put his hand up your skirt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Very likely,</v>

482
00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:59.440
<v Speaker 5>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But there's also someone who could be</v>

483
00:21:59.441 --> 00:22:04.441
<v Speaker 5>seriously deceptive and very ambitious</v>
<v Speaker 5>and realizes that bill o'reilly's kind</v>

484
00:22:04.511 --> 00:22:06.340
<v Speaker 5>of a Twat and this is what I'm going to</v>
<v Speaker 5>do.</v>

485
00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:09.730
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to get close to this old cut</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I'm going to get this guy to get</v>

486
00:22:09.731 --> 00:22:12.130
<v Speaker 5>creepy with me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then I'm an exaggerate what he did</v>

487
00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:14.020
<v Speaker 5>and I'm going to profit off of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

488
00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:14.540
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you,</v>

489
00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:17.770
<v Speaker 5>you don't understand that they've paid</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking millions of dollars to people.</v>

490
00:22:17.771 --> 00:22:22.600
<v Speaker 5>So there's a real industry and getting</v>
<v Speaker 5>bill o'reilly to get creepy with you.</v>

491
00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:24.760
<v Speaker 5>Like I was a chick,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

492
00:22:24.761 --> 00:22:28.120
<v Speaker 5>especially if I was like a really</v>
<v Speaker 5>unscrupulous chick,</v>

493
00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:30.400
<v Speaker 5>he tied my knee.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's half a million.</v>

494
00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:32.320
<v Speaker 5>He wants to confide.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a million and a half.</v>

495
00:22:32.321 --> 00:22:34.240
<v Speaker 5>This guy's a Douche bag,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but this is what I'm gonna do.</v>

496
00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:38.050
<v Speaker 5>I'm just going to like kind of give him</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a semi green light,</v>

497
00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:39.263
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just a little bit.</v>

498
00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:41.030
<v Speaker 5>I take it back a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>take it back.</v>

499
00:22:41.031 --> 00:22:43.630
<v Speaker 5>And the problem is though,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that this kind of skepticism towards</v>

500
00:22:43.631 --> 00:22:45.790
<v Speaker 5>women's stories about sexual assault</v>
<v Speaker 5>has,</v>

501
00:22:45.791 --> 00:22:49.390
<v Speaker 5>is what has pr permitted?</v>
<v Speaker 5>People like him to get away with it for</v>

502
00:22:49.391 --> 00:22:50.770
<v Speaker 5>decades and centuries.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

503
00:22:50.771 --> 00:22:52.840
<v Speaker 5>Like it doesn't agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I take your point that it's hot</v>

504
00:22:52.841 --> 00:22:53.531
<v Speaker 5>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

505
00:22:53.531 --> 00:22:54.251
<v Speaker 5>it's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he said,</v>

506
00:22:54.251 --> 00:22:56.920
<v Speaker 5>she said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that's what I think power</v>

507
00:22:57.100 --> 00:23:00.550
<v Speaker 5>has gotten,</v>
<v Speaker 5>allowed them to get away with it.</v>

508
00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:03.730
<v Speaker 5>I think fear and power,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the fear of this powerful man,</v>

509
00:23:03.970 --> 00:23:07.150
<v Speaker 5>I think that has been the doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're not being believed part of that.</v>

510
00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:11.560
<v Speaker 5>Maybe I think the repercussions that</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's going to ruin your career,</v>

511
00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:13.150
<v Speaker 5>that he's going to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that he has influence.</v>

512
00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:16.540
<v Speaker 5>And also that if you just play ball,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'll get something from it.</v>

513
00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:17.650
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

514
00:23:17.651 --> 00:23:18.940
<v Speaker 5>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially,</v>

515
00:23:18.941 --> 00:23:22.120
<v Speaker 5>I'm not talking about an individual</v>
<v Speaker 5>person and saying this individual person</v>

516
00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:24.310
<v Speaker 5>not telling the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What I'm doing is just making</v>

517
00:23:24.311 --> 00:23:28.000
<v Speaker 5>hypothetical's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just saying if I was a check and I</v>

518
00:23:28.001 --> 00:23:28.780
<v Speaker 5>was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

519
00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:33.100
<v Speaker 5>an unscrupulous sort of social climber</v>
<v Speaker 5>and we all know that they exist,</v>

520
00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:37.420
<v Speaker 5>and I was the type of person that really</v>
<v Speaker 5>wanted to make it in this business,</v>

521
00:23:37.421 --> 00:23:38.260
<v Speaker 5>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

522
00:23:38.261 --> 00:23:42.070
<v Speaker 5>I'm working for an asshole and I already</v>
<v Speaker 5>know this five chicks we got paid.</v>

523
00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:44.140
<v Speaker 5>They've already paid out 13 million</v>
<v Speaker 5>bucks.</v>

524
00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:46.130
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to and move in on this.</v>

525
00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:49.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm interested that that route that</v>
<v Speaker 1>turned on him.</v>

526
00:23:49.670 --> 00:23:52.790
<v Speaker 1>Then Rupert Murdoch turned on him and</v>
<v Speaker 1>kicked him out when he's still making a</v>

527
00:23:52.791 --> 00:23:55.400
<v Speaker 1>ton of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's still the number one cable show.</v>

528
00:23:55.401 --> 00:23:56.360
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or he was,</v>

529
00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:58.160
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe Tucker Carlson had a meeting with</v>

530
00:23:58.161 --> 00:23:59.570
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pulled him aside.</v>

531
00:23:59.571 --> 00:24:00.770
<v Speaker 1>They listen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck God.</v>

532
00:24:00.771 --> 00:24:04.560
<v Speaker 1>That tide comes in and out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus fucking</v>

533
00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:12.470
<v Speaker 1>speaking of someone who will say</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever they think their audience wants</v>

534
00:24:12.471 --> 00:24:14.400
<v Speaker 1>them to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Taka.</v>

535
00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:16.760
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he got right there with his stupid old</v>

536
00:24:16.761 --> 00:24:17.970
<v Speaker 1>bow tie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't have a bow.</v>

537
00:24:17.971 --> 00:24:18.670
<v Speaker 1>Tiny one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's no,</v>

538
00:24:18.670 --> 00:24:20.310
<v Speaker 1>he got rid of it soon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a straight time.</v>

539
00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:21.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both ties to gay.</v>

540
00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:24.500
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't be associated with that.</v>

541
00:24:24.530 --> 00:24:27.520
<v Speaker 1>Or clowns or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who's got like a camera in it.</v>

542
00:24:27.521 --> 00:24:29.930
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm amazed that he's had his renaissance</v>

543
00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:33.860
<v Speaker 1>taka like he was there was that classic</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Stewart moment when he used to host</v>

544
00:24:33.861 --> 00:24:34.694
<v Speaker 1>crossfire.</v>

545
00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:37.010
<v Speaker 1>Chuck Tucker Carlson and John went on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

546
00:24:37.011 --> 00:24:40.160
<v Speaker 1>you're a grown man wearing a bow tie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop hurting America.</v>

547
00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:46.280
<v Speaker 1>The Johnston in that regard where he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>funny on his show when he was doing a</v>

548
00:24:46.281 --> 00:24:49.240
<v Speaker 1>scripted monologue and talking to people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was gracious but did view,</v>

549
00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:52.400
<v Speaker 1>if he came on your show and he had an</v>
<v Speaker 1>issue with you,</v>

550
00:24:52.790 --> 00:24:56.810
<v Speaker 1>you would find out how fucking smart and</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean he could really go after you.</v>

551
00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:58.010
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is,</v>

552
00:24:58.011 --> 00:25:00.080
<v Speaker 1>which is good cause I mean Taco.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

553
00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:02.750
<v Speaker 1>Would it be to think about whether or</v>
<v Speaker 1>not bill o'reilly believes what he</v>

554
00:25:02.751 --> 00:25:04.010
<v Speaker 1>believes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think tuck a nose.</v>

555
00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:07.130
<v Speaker 1>Like taco has this constant faith.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has this have,</v>

556
00:25:07.131 --> 00:25:09.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're listening to audio podcasts,</v>

557
00:25:09.471 --> 00:25:12.290
<v Speaker 1>you can see my face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's kind of furrowed brow and like</v>

558
00:25:12.291 --> 00:25:14.000
<v Speaker 1>mouth breathing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of like,</v>

559
00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:14.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

560
00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:17.720
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he plays the role of like the bemused</v>

561
00:25:17.721 --> 00:25:21.630
<v Speaker 1>clown who doesn't know who's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just a common man from mine,</v>

562
00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:23.000
<v Speaker 1>just middle America.</v>

563
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand what you're talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

564
00:25:25.341 --> 00:25:27.080
<v Speaker 1>And he's like very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

565
00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:30.530
<v Speaker 1>very riding the fence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very kind of riding the fence.</v>

566
00:25:30.531 --> 00:25:33.650
<v Speaker 1>Very like never quite having an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just missed a common sense.</v>

567
00:25:33.651 --> 00:25:37.100
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm just saying it like I see it</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>

568
00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:41.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would assume that a lot of these women</v>

569
00:25:41.481 --> 00:25:42.760
<v Speaker 1>were telling the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one.</v>

570
00:25:42.810 --> 00:25:44.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm definitely not saying that they</v>

571
00:25:44.991 --> 00:25:46.460
<v Speaker 1>weren't telling the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I'm saying is,</v>

572
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what happened or what</v>

573
00:25:48.681 --> 00:25:50.390
<v Speaker 1>didn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know whether he should be fired</v>

574
00:25:50.391 --> 00:25:52.160
<v Speaker 1>or shouldn't be fired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mean?</v>

575
00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:55.400
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he feels that he fills a niche.</v>

576
00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:58.910
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if it's my company and you have to</v>

577
00:25:58.911 --> 00:26:01.130
<v Speaker 1>worry about this guy representing you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

578
00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:02.240
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>

579
00:26:02.241 --> 00:26:04.070
<v Speaker 1>Where you wouldn't want that guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>representing you because he's</v>

580
00:26:04.071 --> 00:26:06.050
<v Speaker 1>problematic and people think he's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>creep.</v>

581
00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:09.290
<v Speaker 1>But he could just go do his own shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Glenn Beck,</v>

582
00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:12.950
<v Speaker 1>he little Horn antic of course he wish</v>
<v Speaker 1>or something and he's not going to go</v>

583
00:26:12.951 --> 00:26:15.440
<v Speaker 1>away quietly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's an interesting,</v>

584
00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:18.710
<v Speaker 1>it's an interesting question about what</v>
<v Speaker 1>happens to the right wing media now.</v>

585
00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:23.300
<v Speaker 1>Cause if Roger ailes is no longer at Fox</v>
<v Speaker 1>News and Bill O'reilly is no longer at</v>

586
00:26:23.301 --> 00:26:25.640
<v Speaker 1>Fox News for the same reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the same reason,</v>

587
00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:29.480
<v Speaker 1>but exactly both guys the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The plays into the same narrative</v>

588
00:26:29.481 --> 00:26:32.630
<v Speaker 1>doesn't let of dirty old white guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a fuck fest going on over there at</v>

589
00:26:32.631 --> 00:26:35.870
<v Speaker 1>Fox News may him just young women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like an old,</v>

590
00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:40.460
<v Speaker 1>like an old porky's movie or like one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those 1970s national lampoon films with</v>

591
00:26:40.461 --> 00:26:42.140
<v Speaker 1>women with their tits hanging,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hanging out.</v>

592
00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:46.180
<v Speaker 1>People are to the dorm tweeten and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hannity now your next handed it.</v>

593
00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:46.711
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

594
00:26:46.711 --> 00:26:50.520
<v Speaker 1>You're going after him now and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Breitbart's had its dude Steve Bannon</v>

595
00:26:50.521 --> 00:26:51.810
<v Speaker 1>sideline in the White House.</v>

596
00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:54.330
<v Speaker 1>So if he can't get along with trump</v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore,</v>

597
00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:55.700
<v Speaker 1>is that true?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

598
00:26:55.701 --> 00:26:56.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not friends with him.</v>

599
00:26:57.570 --> 00:26:59.490
<v Speaker 1>I love rumors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't call him up.</v>

600
00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:01.290
<v Speaker 1>Hey Steve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey stevie,</v>

601
00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:02.990
<v Speaker 1>Stevie Bay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How you doing?</v>

602
00:27:03.010 --> 00:27:05.040
<v Speaker 1>How are you doing with that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>With Donnie these days?</v>

603
00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:08.070
<v Speaker 1>How are you guys still close?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jared is running the show now.</v>

604
00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:10.170
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think he had to make a decision</v>

605
00:27:10.171 --> 00:27:13.090
<v Speaker 1>and he kind of sideline to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the white nationalists a bit.</v>

606
00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:16.710
<v Speaker 1>Any kind of empowered the old school</v>
<v Speaker 1>Republican orthodoxy.</v>

607
00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:18.120
<v Speaker 1>Gee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be pissed if you were a trump</v>

608
00:27:18.121 --> 00:27:18.954
<v Speaker 1>voter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't you?</v>

609
00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:21.900
<v Speaker 1>Did have a Jew running shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well not just to have a job.</v>

610
00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:24.780
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe's doesn't help.</v>

611
00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:27.660
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just mean like so much of what he sort</v>

612
00:27:27.661 --> 00:27:29.400
<v Speaker 1>of ran on was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be different.</v>

613
00:27:29.401 --> 00:27:32.290
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to be the same old</v>
<v Speaker 1>politics and now you know we're going to</v>

614
00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:34.200
<v Speaker 1>repeal obamacare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that didn't work out.</v>

615
00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:37.380
<v Speaker 1>That's just going to be tax co.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now he bombed Syria where you weren't</v>

616
00:27:37.381 --> 00:27:39.720
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be bombing people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought we were going to get out of</v>

617
00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:43.010
<v Speaker 1>all these foreign wars and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't care like that</v>

618
00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:44.530
<v Speaker 5>many people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

619
00:27:44.530 --> 00:27:49.040
<v Speaker 5>they have this cognitive dissonance that</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have in addressing his actions as</v>

620
00:27:49.041 --> 00:27:51.020
<v Speaker 5>so they're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're the support of him.</v>

621
00:27:51.021 --> 00:27:53.450
<v Speaker 5>They're so happy that they won.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They would,</v>

622
00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:55.640
<v Speaker 5>they would never want to take away their</v>
<v Speaker 5>victory.</v>

623
00:27:55.910 --> 00:27:59.330
<v Speaker 5>Like the people that are happy that</v>
<v Speaker 5>trump is in office are so happy that he</v>

624
00:27:59.331 --> 00:28:04.250
<v Speaker 5>won and they won with him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That any little thing that happens,</v>

625
00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:07.220
<v Speaker 5>they just come up with some sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 5>way to rational</v>

626
00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:09.210
<v Speaker 1>some of them do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them do.</v>

627
00:28:09.211 --> 00:28:13.200
<v Speaker 1>I start a story the other day about a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about a county in Pennsylvania or</v>

628
00:28:13.201 --> 00:28:14.034
<v Speaker 1>something which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

629
00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:17.100
<v Speaker 1>which had voted for Obama twice and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>voted for trump because they thought</v>

630
00:28:17.101 --> 00:28:19.170
<v Speaker 1>they were going to get changed and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all just like,</v>

631
00:28:19.171 --> 00:28:21.030
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just seems like a regular Republican.</v>

632
00:28:21.031 --> 00:28:23.930
<v Speaker 1>He's going to try to attack cut taxes</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the rich and go,</v>

633
00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:26.610
<v Speaker 1>go to war with foreign countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't from what this is and what we</v>

634
00:28:26.611 --> 00:28:28.830
<v Speaker 1>bargained for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it'll be interesting to see whether</v>

635
00:28:28.831 --> 00:28:33.831
<v Speaker 1>or not they flip back and four years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I take your point that they're just</v>

636
00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:36.000
<v Speaker 1>really happy that hillary is not the</v>
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>

637
00:28:36.390 --> 00:28:37.770
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people that are really</v>
<v Speaker 1>happy.</v>

638
00:28:37.771 --> 00:28:40.200
<v Speaker 1>She's not the president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think bill's the biggest,</v>

639
00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:43.630
<v Speaker 1>I think bill's super happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like fine.</v>

640
00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:47.390
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to have to go back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

641
00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:50.040
<v Speaker 1>There was a law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The tail in that house.</v>

642
00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:51.970
<v Speaker 5>He gets plenty of tail.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

643
00:28:51.971 --> 00:28:54.430
<v Speaker 5>Betty downside side.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you see all that Sheila Riley</v>

644
00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:58.720
<v Speaker 5>political system in the wikileaks memos</v>
<v Speaker 5>about the Commonwealth.</v>

645
00:28:58.990 --> 00:29:03.990
<v Speaker 5>What was talking about him banging</v>
<v Speaker 5>hookers on the side was like talking</v>

646
00:29:04.001 --> 00:29:08.290
<v Speaker 5>about how bills at home banging bimbos</v>
<v Speaker 5>and there was some thing about me,</v>

647
00:29:08.291 --> 00:29:10.990
<v Speaker 5>Colin Powell is just fucking blitz it in</v>
<v Speaker 5>emails.</v>

648
00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:14.470
<v Speaker 5>They talk shit like just like regular</v>
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

649
00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:18.370
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't put it in an email very well and</v>

650
00:29:18.371 --> 00:29:22.300
<v Speaker 5>we learned nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't send it to fucking anybody who's</v>

651
00:29:22.301 --> 00:29:23.500
<v Speaker 5>got an insecure server.</v>

652
00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:26.090
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well just don't write it down at all and</v>

653
00:29:26.091 --> 00:29:27.890
<v Speaker 1>not even get kind of rarely talk now</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>

654
00:29:27.891 --> 00:29:29.380
<v Speaker 1>Cause that means that you're going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>spied.</v>

655
00:29:29.381 --> 00:29:30.214
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

656
00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:33.890
<v Speaker 5>How are we going to have a private</v>
<v Speaker 5>conversations to just to just pull shit</v>

657
00:29:33.891 --> 00:29:38.120
<v Speaker 5>on people just let it fly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This like what we've said here,</v>

658
00:29:38.170 --> 00:29:40.820
<v Speaker 5>cause usually have been in a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in a private email.</v>

659
00:29:40.850 --> 00:29:43.210
<v Speaker 5>Yup that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Questioning whether or not bill</v>

660
00:29:43.211 --> 00:29:46.210
<v Speaker 5>o'reilly's intelligent or whether or not</v>
<v Speaker 5>he really believes that or whether or</v>

661
00:29:46.211 --> 00:29:48.550
<v Speaker 5>not in a religious people are actually</v>
<v Speaker 5>intelligent,</v>

662
00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:52.000
<v Speaker 5>which I f you know clearly there there's</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of religious people that are</v>

663
00:29:52.001 --> 00:29:55.750
<v Speaker 5>intelligent and I mean part of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>problem is that people give too much of</v>

664
00:29:55.751 --> 00:29:57.850
<v Speaker 5>a crap about things that people have</v>
<v Speaker 5>said in the past.</v>

665
00:29:57.851 --> 00:30:01.090
<v Speaker 5>I mean we've spoken about this before in</v>
<v Speaker 5>relation to political correctness or</v>

666
00:30:01.091 --> 00:30:03.040
<v Speaker 5>something or like using the wrong</v>
<v Speaker 5>language.</v>

667
00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:07.970
<v Speaker 5>I think as more and more of what we say</v>
<v Speaker 5>gets intercepted or at least in</v>

668
00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:12.980
<v Speaker 5>susceptible in emails and also in phone</v>
<v Speaker 5>calls and so on and we're being spied on</v>

669
00:30:13.001 --> 00:30:15.460
<v Speaker 5>all the time and things can be leaked</v>
<v Speaker 5>and things can be hacked.</v>

670
00:30:15.910 --> 00:30:18.880
<v Speaker 5>People are just going to have to chill</v>
<v Speaker 5>the fuck out a little bit about people's</v>

671
00:30:18.881 --> 00:30:20.680
<v Speaker 5>past.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Otherwise we're only going to end up</v>

672
00:30:20.681 --> 00:30:24.850
<v Speaker 5>with the most boring anodyne and people</v>
<v Speaker 5>in positions of power because it's only</v>

673
00:30:24.851 --> 00:30:27.490
<v Speaker 5>going to be people who've always watched</v>
<v Speaker 5>exactly what they say,</v>

674
00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:30.410
<v Speaker 5>who are able to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who have never kind of triggered a trip</v>

675
00:30:30.411 --> 00:30:34.030
<v Speaker 5>wire and who have never gotten people</v>
<v Speaker 5>angry and just sense trumps the big</v>

676
00:30:34.031 --> 00:30:35.350
<v Speaker 5>victory for that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>

677
00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:38.370
<v Speaker 5>You see what I said after trump was</v>
<v Speaker 5>elected that political correct.</v>

678
00:30:38.371 --> 00:30:41.320
<v Speaker 5>It's just took a missile to the Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>

679
00:30:41.650 --> 00:30:43.510
<v Speaker 5>This is just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it just shows you,</v>

680
00:30:43.511 --> 00:30:48.460
<v Speaker 5>you could be out there and grabbing</v>
<v Speaker 5>pussies talking crap fucking people,</v>

681
00:30:48.461 --> 00:30:49.540
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's okay.</v>

682
00:30:49.770 --> 00:30:50.980
<v Speaker 5>Like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not,</v>

683
00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:54.580
<v Speaker 5>it's the world has changed in that</v>
<v Speaker 5>regard and part of the,</v>

684
00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:56.930
<v Speaker 5>I mean part of the problem there is that</v>
<v Speaker 5>the things that he,</v>

685
00:30:56.940 --> 00:31:00.190
<v Speaker 5>some of the things that he says really I</v>
<v Speaker 5>ad like,</v>

686
00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:03.190
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that it's appropriate to</v>
<v Speaker 5>be to,</v>

687
00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:05.650
<v Speaker 5>to talk about women the way that he</v>
<v Speaker 5>talks about women.</v>

688
00:31:05.651 --> 00:31:06.730
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it's appropriate.</v>

689
00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:12.340
<v Speaker 5>Basically.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Basically the problem with that is he's</v>

690
00:31:12.341 --> 00:31:14.680
<v Speaker 5>talking to a dude and trying to make</v>
<v Speaker 5>them laugh.</v>

691
00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:15.551
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

692
00:31:15.551 --> 00:31:19.150
<v Speaker 5>he's having a private conversation with</v>
<v Speaker 5>a guy and he's doing what he called</v>

693
00:31:19.151 --> 00:31:21.550
<v Speaker 5>locker room talk.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Guys Talk Shit.</v>

694
00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:24.340
<v Speaker 5>And they say things they don't really</v>
<v Speaker 5>mean and he's,</v>

695
00:31:24.341 --> 00:31:25.990
<v Speaker 5>what he said was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I'm not,</v>

696
00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:28.600
<v Speaker 5>I'm not an apologist,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just let me get this out of the way.</v>

697
00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:32.080
<v Speaker 5>What he said was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can just grab them by the Pussy.</v>

698
00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:34.780
<v Speaker 5>They let you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can do anything that you want when</v>

699
00:31:34.781 --> 00:31:37.090
<v Speaker 5>you were a big celebrity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He just grabbed him by the pussy.</v>

700
00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:41.890
<v Speaker 5>Like what he's saying is not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I grab women by the Pussy and sexually</v>

701
00:31:41.891 --> 00:31:43.000
<v Speaker 5>assault them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

702
00:31:43.001 --> 00:31:47.020
<v Speaker 5>he's just being totally outrageous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like a punchline for a joke.</v>

703
00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:49.990
<v Speaker 5>He's exaggerating the reality of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>situation.</v>

704
00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:54.010
<v Speaker 5>He's saying he's so famous saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you're as famous as me,</v>

705
00:31:54.011 --> 00:31:55.030
<v Speaker 5>you can do anything.</v>

706
00:31:55.030 --> 00:31:58.120
<v Speaker 5>You can grab them by the pussy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's trying that you,</v>

707
00:31:58.390 --> 00:32:00.970
<v Speaker 5>he's saying they let you meaning</v>
<v Speaker 5>implying consent.</v>

708
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.860
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I say he's not talking about sexual</v>

709
00:32:02.861 --> 00:32:03.331
<v Speaker 5>assault.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's,</v>

710
00:32:03.331 --> 00:32:04.450
<v Speaker 5>so when people were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

711
00:32:04.451 --> 00:32:05.980
<v Speaker 5>he's doing sexual assault.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

712
00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:09.040
<v Speaker 5>he's talking about girls that are in</v>
<v Speaker 5>thrawled with the fact that they're</v>

713
00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:11.800
<v Speaker 5>around.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This guy was his fucking name on</v>

714
00:32:11.801 --> 00:32:14.890
<v Speaker 5>skyscrapers and he flies around with a</v>
<v Speaker 5>jet with his name on it.</v>

715
00:32:14.891 --> 00:32:18.010
<v Speaker 5>And if you're that type of woman and</v>
<v Speaker 5>there are that look,</v>

716
00:32:18.011 --> 00:32:20.410
<v Speaker 5>there's that type of men.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's that type of women were not,</v>

717
00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:25.440
<v Speaker 5>it does not a gross generalization about</v>
<v Speaker 5>men or women but guaranteed your son</v>

718
00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:29.260
<v Speaker 5>some women that when they're in the face</v>
<v Speaker 5>of a guy like Donald Trump,</v>

719
00:32:29.261 --> 00:32:31.840
<v Speaker 5>they react that way and they let him do</v>
<v Speaker 5>anything they want and they love it.</v>

720
00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:33.220
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there is that possibility.</v>

721
00:32:33.250 --> 00:32:35.920
<v Speaker 5>There is that possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I also thought that the phrasing of that</v>

722
00:32:35.921 --> 00:32:38.770
<v Speaker 5>term was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was kind of funny like yeah they let</v>

723
00:32:38.771 --> 00:32:40.100
<v Speaker 5>you grab them but like how</v>

724
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:43.100
<v Speaker 3>do you grab it to see exactly like where</v>
<v Speaker 3>do your fingers go?</v>

725
00:32:43.101 --> 00:32:43.934
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

726
00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:47.600
<v Speaker 3>when does this some who's doing like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what?</v>

727
00:32:47.601 --> 00:32:51.290
<v Speaker 3>It sounded to me like with someone who</v>
<v Speaker 3>is inept sexually,</v>

728
00:32:51.770 --> 00:32:54.410
<v Speaker 3>which by many accounts he is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are lots of accounts of like when</v>

729
00:32:54.411 --> 00:32:56.780
<v Speaker 3>he was married to or dating the most</v>
<v Speaker 3>beautiful people,</v>

730
00:32:56.781 --> 00:32:59.170
<v Speaker 3>he'd be downstairs eating Cheetos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>watching late night news,</v>

731
00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:04.420
<v Speaker 3>cable news while they were upstairs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like not believe that will because well</v>

732
00:33:04.461 --> 00:33:06.140
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just compare it to whether or not it</v>

733
00:33:06.141 --> 00:33:08.180
<v Speaker 3>comports with what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what else do you know about him,</v>

734
00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:12.680
<v Speaker 3>which is that he's very image focused</v>
<v Speaker 3>and cares a lot about being thought to</v>

735
00:33:12.681 --> 00:33:15.830
<v Speaker 3>be the best at everything and the most</v>
<v Speaker 3>glamorous and the richest.</v>

736
00:33:16.130 --> 00:33:18.140
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would imagine that it would be</v>

737
00:33:18.141 --> 00:33:21.320
<v Speaker 3>consistent with his personality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he would want to present a front of</v>

738
00:33:21.321 --> 00:33:25.750
<v Speaker 3>being more of a slayer and more of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>sexual demon than he actually is sexual</v>

739
00:33:25.790 --> 00:33:26.623
<v Speaker 3>bands.</v>

740
00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:30.020
<v Speaker 3>It's a great name for a band.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the sites.</v>

741
00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:32.450
<v Speaker 3>So the grab them by the Pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sort of reminded me a little bit of</v>

742
00:33:32.451 --> 00:33:34.370
<v Speaker 3>the way that 15 year old boys would talk</v>
<v Speaker 3>to each other.</v>

743
00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:35.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>

744
00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:40.040
<v Speaker 3>Or two</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys say ridiculous things that they</v>

745
00:33:40.041 --> 00:33:42.290
<v Speaker 3>don't mean you get other people to</v>
<v Speaker 3>laugh.</v>

746
00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:43.520
<v Speaker 3>I will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will grant you that.</v>

747
00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:45.230
<v Speaker 3>Girls do too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

748
00:33:45.231 --> 00:33:48.380
<v Speaker 3>my point about political correctness is</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I don't think trump has is our</v>

749
00:33:48.381 --> 00:33:49.490
<v Speaker 3>best,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

750
00:33:49.491 --> 00:33:52.700
<v Speaker 3>ambassador for the anti political</v>
<v Speaker 3>correctness brigade.</v>

751
00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:55.370
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and part of his rise,</v>

752
00:33:55.371 --> 00:33:59.180
<v Speaker 3>part of the backlash is a backlash</v>
<v Speaker 3>against the,</v>

753
00:33:59.210 --> 00:34:00.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've had so many conversations that we</v>

754
00:34:00.861 --> 00:34:04.460
<v Speaker 3>all know it by now with we're bored of</v>
<v Speaker 3>like people who go,</v>

755
00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:07.280
<v Speaker 3>who absolutely lose their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

756
00:34:07.281 --> 00:34:11.030
<v Speaker 3>just go crazy because you use the wrong</v>
<v Speaker 3>transgender pronoun or something like</v>

757
00:34:11.031 --> 00:34:11.740
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

758
00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:15.150
<v Speaker 3>you say he instead of she or whatever it</v>
<v Speaker 3>is all these times or microaggressions</v>

759
00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:18.710
<v Speaker 3>and stuff like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or all of that kind of bullshit,</v>

760
00:34:18.711 --> 00:34:21.650
<v Speaker 3>I think gave rise to an environment in</v>
<v Speaker 3>which people are so frustrated with</v>

761
00:34:21.651 --> 00:34:23.750
<v Speaker 3>political correctness that they</v>
<v Speaker 3>unleashed.</v>

762
00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:25.720
<v Speaker 3>And it was like a pressure cooker</v>
<v Speaker 3>exploding and,</v>

763
00:34:25.721 --> 00:34:27.950
<v Speaker 3>and the trump hair went everywhere and</v>
<v Speaker 3>just trump,</v>

764
00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:29.300
<v Speaker 3>he's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

765
00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:30.850
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I don't think it'd be,</v>

766
00:34:30.870 --> 00:34:32.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things would have been better if we</v>

767
00:34:32.121 --> 00:34:34.460
<v Speaker 3>hadn't gotten to that place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we could all just take a chill pill.</v>

768
00:34:34.461 --> 00:34:36.020
<v Speaker 3>I think we need to learn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

769
00:34:36.021 --> 00:34:39.380
<v Speaker 3>and I think we need to make mistakes so</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we can learn.</v>

770
00:34:39.410 --> 00:34:43.220
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that's really</v>
<v Speaker 3>unfortunate is that he doesn't tell the</v>

771
00:34:43.221 --> 00:34:47.750
<v Speaker 3>truth and that he's the president and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>shows that you can just not tell the</v>

772
00:34:47.751 --> 00:34:49.340
<v Speaker 3>truth and be the president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

773
00:34:49.370 --> 00:34:52.880
<v Speaker 3>About all kinds of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The alternative facts analogy,</v>

774
00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:57.530
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to grapple with this on my</v>

775
00:34:57.531 --> 00:34:58.800
<v Speaker 3>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

776
00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:01.370
<v Speaker 3>because I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what's,</v>

777
00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:04.400
<v Speaker 3>what's dangerous about trump is that is</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just that he,</v>

778
00:35:04.490 --> 00:35:07.460
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't tell the truth because lots</v>
<v Speaker 3>of people point out,</v>

779
00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:09.230
<v Speaker 3>many politicians don't tell the truth.</v>

780
00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:14.660
<v Speaker 3>It's that he doesn't even care that he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>not telling the truth and he doesn't</v>

781
00:35:14.661 --> 00:35:18.260
<v Speaker 3>behave as if there is such a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really as truth.</v>

782
00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:23.390
<v Speaker 3>Like the other day he talked about the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the warships that were heading for the</v>

783
00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:24.260
<v Speaker 3>Korean Peninsula.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you see this,</v>

784
00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:28.010
<v Speaker 3>this story?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said that we've got this aircraft</v>

785
00:35:28.011 --> 00:35:29.900
<v Speaker 3>carrier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is going towards Korea.</v>

786
00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:35.630
<v Speaker 3>It was going in the opposite direction</v>
<v Speaker 3>to Australia to not attack Australia.</v>

787
00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:39.740
<v Speaker 3>But do I have a military exercise with</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ozzies and now and then Sean Spicer</v>

788
00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:41.700
<v Speaker 3>got there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know the press corps went crazy and</v>

789
00:35:41.701 --> 00:35:43.740
<v Speaker 3>the White House correspondence and Sean</v>
<v Speaker 3>Spicer was like,</v>

790
00:35:43.741 --> 00:35:47.490
<v Speaker 3>well I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was saying that it had been heading,</v>

791
00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:52.670
<v Speaker 3>it was going to be going to the Korean</v>
<v Speaker 3>Peninsula but it was just do on a DJ.</v>

792
00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:55.560
<v Speaker 3>So he wasn't saying the actual direction</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the aircraft carrier.</v>

793
00:35:55.561 --> 00:35:58.290
<v Speaker 3>He was saying that it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was talking about the overall</v>

794
00:35:58.590 --> 00:36:03.590
<v Speaker 3>strategy of what and like poor old spicy</v>
<v Speaker 3>is out there trying to make trump</v>

795
00:36:04.791 --> 00:36:09.030
<v Speaker 3>statements comport with something with</v>
<v Speaker 3>reality in some way.</v>

796
00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:14.310
<v Speaker 3>But trump is just an explosive like</v>
<v Speaker 3>vomit machine just tweeting out stuff</v>

797
00:36:14.311 --> 00:36:17.100
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't even have to map onto</v>
<v Speaker 3>reality at all.</v>

798
00:36:17.310 --> 00:36:21.480
<v Speaker 3>And he always seems to take pride I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think in the fact that he can say</v>

799
00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:24.390
<v Speaker 3>whatever million people at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>inauguration.</v>

800
00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:27.740
<v Speaker 3>When I started talking the rain stopped</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the sun.</v>

801
00:36:28.050 --> 00:36:29.760
<v Speaker 3>That was pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you working on that show?</v>

802
00:36:29.850 --> 00:36:32.490
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like the impression that needs work.</v>

803
00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:34.320
<v Speaker 3>It needs a little work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but everyone's got their trump.</v>

804
00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:35.333
<v Speaker 3>But you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

805
00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:40.430
<v Speaker 3>he will say things and then almost take,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like he gets his Joel,</v>

806
00:36:40.941 --> 00:36:45.690
<v Speaker 3>he gets his rocks off through the sheer</v>
<v Speaker 3>audacity of being able to say whatever</v>

807
00:36:45.691 --> 00:36:49.590
<v Speaker 3>the hell he wants and just make his</v>
<v Speaker 3>opponents go crazy because they don't</v>

808
00:36:49.591 --> 00:36:51.780
<v Speaker 3>even get to a game of whack a mall then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

809
00:36:51.781 --> 00:36:53.010
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

810
00:36:53.011 --> 00:36:55.300
<v Speaker 3>you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's true.</v>

811
00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:58.620
<v Speaker 4>So he's acting as a politician for the</v>
<v Speaker 4>first time in his life and he's 70.</v>

812
00:36:58.890 --> 00:37:03.060
<v Speaker 4>So for his entire life he's been this</v>
<v Speaker 4>braggadocious guy who is exaggerated</v>

813
00:37:03.061 --> 00:37:06.810
<v Speaker 4>facts and built up this amazing persona</v>
<v Speaker 4>and exaggerated wealth and he's</v>

814
00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:09.960
<v Speaker 4>obviously very successful but</v>
<v Speaker 4>exaggerates that success.</v>

815
00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:12.080
<v Speaker 4>So like the thing about him winning the</v>
<v Speaker 4>inauguration,</v>

816
00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:16.110
<v Speaker 4>remember that really interesting</v>
<v Speaker 4>exchange that he had with a reporter.</v>

817
00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:18.180
<v Speaker 4>It was young reporter and he was up</v>
<v Speaker 4>there saying,</v>

818
00:37:18.450 --> 00:37:22.590
<v Speaker 4>we won by the largest margin now blah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just margin in the electoral college.</v>

819
00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:24.990
<v Speaker 4>That's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he said,</v>

820
00:37:24.991 --> 00:37:26.280
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the law just for,</v>

821
00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:27.420
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Republican,</v>

822
00:37:27.421 --> 00:37:28.950
<v Speaker 4>a Republican.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's also true.</v>

823
00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:30.360
<v Speaker 4>So he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>George H.</v>

824
00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:33.330
<v Speaker 4>Bush or George Herbert Walker Bush had</v>
<v Speaker 4>much larger margin.</v>

825
00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:35.370
<v Speaker 4>And so he explained to him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

826
00:37:35.371 --> 00:37:37.440
<v Speaker 4>you will agree that we won by</v>
<v Speaker 4>substantial number.</v>

827
00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:39.000
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well you are the president.</v>

828
00:37:39.001 --> 00:37:40.540
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was like,</v>

829
00:37:40.650 --> 00:37:42.180
<v Speaker 4>good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want tic TAC toe.</v>

830
00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:43.530
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>

831
00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:47.130
<v Speaker 4>it's just he's not a politician and</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what people like about them,</v>

832
00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:48.810
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then he starts doing all these</v>

833
00:37:48.811 --> 00:37:50.220
<v Speaker 4>different things like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

834
00:37:50.221 --> 00:37:55.221
<v Speaker 4>he's trying to get all these different</v>
<v Speaker 4>plants to reopen and give Americans jobs</v>

835
00:37:55.291 --> 00:37:58.080
<v Speaker 4>and they talk about all the jobs that</v>
<v Speaker 4>have been created and people get excited</v>

836
00:37:58.081 --> 00:37:59.760
<v Speaker 4>and they signed this new thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>yesterday.</v>

837
00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:00.631
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

838
00:38:00.631 --> 00:38:04.200
<v Speaker 4>American made American sales and try to</v>
<v Speaker 4>encourage people to buy and make</v>

839
00:38:04.201 --> 00:38:07.320
<v Speaker 4>American and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then trying to get rid of foreigners</v>

840
00:38:07.321 --> 00:38:10.680
<v Speaker 4>that are sneaking over here and doing</v>
<v Speaker 4>bad things and you know,</v>

841
00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:13.530
<v Speaker 4>the base,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the people that have been clamoring for</v>

842
00:38:13.531 --> 00:38:15.990
<v Speaker 4>that kind of response get very excited.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's cool.</v>

843
00:38:16.010 --> 00:38:16.411
<v Speaker 4>We'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll,</v>

844
00:38:16.411 --> 00:38:18.240
<v Speaker 4>we'll deal with the lies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The lies are fine.</v>

845
00:38:18.450 --> 00:38:20.280
<v Speaker 4>As long as he opens up that Ford plant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll,</v>

846
00:38:20.281 --> 00:38:21.360
<v Speaker 4>the lies are bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But look,</v>

847
00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:23.940
<v Speaker 4>he got those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a Guatemalan terrorists,</v>

848
00:38:23.941 --> 00:38:26.820
<v Speaker 4>drug dealers out of Chicago or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

849
00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:27.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think the,</v>

850
00:38:27.711 --> 00:38:30.620
<v Speaker 3>I think that there's a feeling that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>whole people who regard themselves as</v>

851
00:38:30.621 --> 00:38:33.740
<v Speaker 3>being custodians of the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a Hoity toity out of touch,</v>

852
00:38:33.741 --> 00:38:36.640
<v Speaker 3>a Leitz who've been shitting the trump</v>
<v Speaker 3>support,</v>

853
00:38:36.641 --> 00:38:38.800
<v Speaker 3>the honest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hardworking trump supporter for so long</v>

854
00:38:38.801 --> 00:38:42.760
<v Speaker 3>that they deserve to be slapped in their</v>
<v Speaker 3>face with a little bit of untruthful</v>

855
00:38:42.761 --> 00:38:43.820
<v Speaker 3>truthiness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

856
00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:48.620
<v Speaker 5>And the judges and the academics people</v>
<v Speaker 5>smarter than you.</v>

857
00:38:48.830 --> 00:38:50.790
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People more educated than you and her</v>

858
00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:53.630
<v Speaker 5>spitting social acts and it makes you</v>
<v Speaker 5>humiliated.</v>

859
00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:55.170
<v Speaker 5>I feel dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

860
00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:57.500
<v Speaker 5>Like the tide goes in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the tide goes out to explain it.</v>

861
00:38:57.680 --> 00:38:59.710
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of the same appeal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

862
00:38:59.711 --> 00:39:01.980
<v Speaker 5>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>

863
00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:09.500
<v Speaker 5>I mean that people do love when liberals</v>
<v Speaker 5>get their comeuppance.</v>

864
00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:14.980
<v Speaker 5>Liberals are really classically</v>
<v Speaker 5>associated with education,</v>

865
00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:18.620
<v Speaker 5>higher education,</v>
<v Speaker 5>bigger vocabularies,</v>

866
00:39:18.650 --> 00:39:19.610
<v Speaker 5>universities.</v>

867
00:39:19.830 --> 00:39:22.760
<v Speaker 3>Funny things about trump that he's the</v>
<v Speaker 3>anti elitist as if the,</v>

868
00:39:22.761 --> 00:39:27.510
<v Speaker 3>as if it is non elite to be a Manhattan</v>
<v Speaker 3>real estate billionaire.</v>

869
00:39:28.590 --> 00:39:29.880
<v Speaker 5>How has that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how has that,</v>

870
00:39:29.881 --> 00:39:32.060
<v Speaker 5>the anti elite,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you just have to say anything.</v>

871
00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:34.590
<v Speaker 5>When Rowan,</v>
<v Speaker 5>George Bush pretended he was from</v>

872
00:39:34.591 --> 00:39:37.770
<v Speaker 5>fucking Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Lot of people don't realize he's from,</v>

873
00:39:37.771 --> 00:39:38.870
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's from the northeast.</v>

874
00:39:38.970 --> 00:39:40.170
<v Speaker 5>He went to Yale.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

875
00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:44.590
<v Speaker 5>He all he did in Texas was clear brush</v>
<v Speaker 5>and brush it.</v>

876
00:39:44.591 --> 00:39:45.830
<v Speaker 5>And when people are looking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yep.</v>

877
00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:47.350
<v Speaker 5>Camera's rolling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>

878
00:39:49.550 --> 00:39:51.180
<v Speaker 5>Chainsawing down trees.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's,</v>

879
00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:52.800
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's the American way.</v>

880
00:39:52.830 --> 00:39:56.990
<v Speaker 5>You pitch people an image.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it is why they have publicists.</v>

881
00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:57.833
<v Speaker 5>Why,</v>

882
00:39:57.940 --> 00:40:01.440
<v Speaker 3>I mean when you say though that trump is</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he's not a politician and that's</v>

883
00:40:01.441 --> 00:40:03.020
<v Speaker 3>what people like about him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

884
00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:07.410
<v Speaker 3>There's the worry is that when you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>president of the United States,</v>

885
00:40:07.650 --> 00:40:11.530
<v Speaker 3>shit you say has any impact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

886
00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:13.410
<v Speaker 3>It is an important position.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So things,</v>

887
00:40:13.411 --> 00:40:17.670
<v Speaker 3>things that you say can be</v>
<v Speaker 3>misinterpreted by the Koreans or the</v>

888
00:40:17.671 --> 00:40:19.470
<v Speaker 3>Russians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's a,</v>

889
00:40:20.370 --> 00:40:24.420
<v Speaker 3>like if you are the president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should know that people in the</v>

890
00:40:24.421 --> 00:40:27.180
<v Speaker 3>executive branch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>such as the president of people in the</v>

891
00:40:27.180 --> 00:40:29.100
<v Speaker 3>White House,</v>
<v Speaker 3>should not disparage people in the</v>

892
00:40:29.101 --> 00:40:31.110
<v Speaker 3>judicial branch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

893
00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:33.660
<v Speaker 3>Because we have a separation of powers</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the United States of America.</v>

894
00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:36.960
<v Speaker 3>So when he made those comments,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example about the judiciary,</v>

895
00:40:36.961 --> 00:40:38.850
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of people think like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

896
00:40:38.851 --> 00:40:41.040
<v Speaker 3>why is everyone getting their tits on a</v>
<v Speaker 3>tangle about them?</v>

897
00:40:41.070 --> 00:40:42.960
<v Speaker 3>Just because he said that the judge was</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

898
00:40:42.961 --> 00:40:45.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>implied that the judge was biased in the</v>

899
00:40:45.031 --> 00:40:46.230
<v Speaker 3>trump university case.</v>

900
00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:51.360
<v Speaker 3>It's because presidential candidates</v>
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't be shitting on judges because</v>

901
00:40:51.361 --> 00:40:55.140
<v Speaker 3>otherwise you end up with situations</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you've got in Venezuela or now in</v>

902
00:40:55.141 --> 00:40:56.760
<v Speaker 3>Turkey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've just had this referendum over</v>

903
00:40:56.761 --> 00:40:59.610
<v Speaker 3>the past weekend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which gave sort of quasi dictatorial</v>

904
00:40:59.611 --> 00:41:04.611
<v Speaker 3>powers to Turkey's president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Similar things happening in Turkey come</v>

905
00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:07.230
<v Speaker 3>dictatorships essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially.</v>

906
00:41:07.231 --> 00:41:10.680
<v Speaker 3>And Russia has done that over the past</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 or 15 years.</v>

907
00:41:10.681 --> 00:41:12.780
<v Speaker 3>And when you listen to people who are</v>
<v Speaker 3>experts in these things,</v>

908
00:41:12.781 --> 00:41:14.820
<v Speaker 3>they always say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just listening to Masha Gessen</v>

909
00:41:14.821 --> 00:41:15.541
<v Speaker 3>who's really into,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

910
00:41:15.541 --> 00:41:18.090
<v Speaker 3>Marcia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's a Russian journalist who lives in</v>

911
00:41:18.091 --> 00:41:20.130
<v Speaker 3>the states now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fascinating person.</v>

912
00:41:20.131 --> 00:41:21.780
<v Speaker 3>She'd be a good person to get to get on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the show.</v>

913
00:41:22.350 --> 00:41:24.800
<v Speaker 3>And she was saying that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

914
00:41:24.801 --> 00:41:27.500
<v Speaker 3>the things that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that nice and to dictators always liked</v>

915
00:41:27.501 --> 00:41:29.700
<v Speaker 3>to do is take,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take down a peg.</v>

916
00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:31.560
<v Speaker 3>People who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

917
00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:34.250
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who rely facts for their living.</v>

918
00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:37.850
<v Speaker 1>So that's journalists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's people in the judicial department</v>

919
00:41:37.851 --> 00:41:39.800
<v Speaker 1>and his academics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's judges,</v>

920
00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:41.960
<v Speaker 1>lawyers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>academics and so on.</v>

921
00:41:41.961 --> 00:41:44.630
<v Speaker 1>That's always what you see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the Putin's and again,</v>

922
00:41:44.810 --> 00:41:47.270
<v Speaker 1>the sort of bill o'reilly mindset of</v>
<v Speaker 1>like tide goes in,</v>

923
00:41:47.271 --> 00:41:48.230
<v Speaker 1>tide goes out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

924
00:41:48.350 --> 00:41:50.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm just a regular guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got my gut going for me.</v>

925
00:41:50.901 --> 00:41:52.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't need all these fancy book</v>
<v Speaker 1>learning.</v>

926
00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:55.880
<v Speaker 1>It's just you and me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's go to Washington DC and take it</v>

927
00:41:55.881 --> 00:41:59.390
<v Speaker 1>back from those fancy elites making</v>
<v Speaker 1>America great,</v>

928
00:41:59.391 --> 00:42:00.980
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're going to do it just without</v>

929
00:42:00.981 --> 00:42:02.510
<v Speaker 1>balls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to grab them by the Pussy</v>

930
00:42:02.511 --> 00:42:05.210
<v Speaker 1>and we're going to drag this country</v>
<v Speaker 1>until the 21st century come.</v>

931
00:42:05.211 --> 00:42:08.290
<v Speaker 1>What may you should run for office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>goddammit,</v>

932
00:42:08.350 --> 00:42:10.730
<v Speaker 1>you're phone out of the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a stupid rule.</v>

933
00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:14.060
<v Speaker 1>It is America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most countries don't have that natural</v>

934
00:42:14.061 --> 00:42:15.170
<v Speaker 1>bone rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most countries,</v>

935
00:42:15.171 --> 00:42:19.100
<v Speaker 1>if you move to that country and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>become a citizen and you live there for</v>

936
00:42:19.101 --> 00:42:21.730
<v Speaker 1>a certain period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure you can move from the highest</v>

937
00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:23.630
<v Speaker 1>office to run for office and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>offended.</v>

938
00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:25.760
<v Speaker 1>Would you run for office if it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>available?</v>

939
00:42:26.030 --> 00:42:28.510
<v Speaker 1>I think I can run for office.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I can't run for president.</v>

940
00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:30.320
<v Speaker 1>Obviously Arnold Schwarzenegger was</v>
<v Speaker 1>governor.</v>

941
00:42:30.321 --> 00:42:31.520
<v Speaker 1>That's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

942
00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:36.200
<v Speaker 1>So I hereby announce my candidacy for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the governorship of California.</v>

943
00:42:36.201 --> 00:42:37.670
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan even live here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

944
00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:39.470
<v Speaker 1>I do now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When did you move?</v>

945
00:42:39.530 --> 00:42:41.840
<v Speaker 1>I move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've kind of oozed between New York and</v>

946
00:42:41.841 --> 00:42:43.910
<v Speaker 1>Los Angeles over the course of the past</v>
<v Speaker 1>four months.</v>

947
00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:47.490
<v Speaker 1>But you're an elite by coastal guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>wearing an accent.</v>

950
00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:53.570
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say the way to get somebody to</v>

951
00:42:53.571 --> 00:42:56.750
<v Speaker 1>slip them in is not to get some brown</v>

<v Speaker 1>Aussie,</v>

954
00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:03.140

978
00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:55.070
<v Speaker 1>And they went through the whole thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they had a surrogate,</v>

979
00:43:55.071 --> 00:43:56.690
<v Speaker 1>the whole deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She carries it and then at the end of it</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm keeping this.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They paid for the kids and that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kosha.</v>

983
00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:04.920
<v Speaker 1>She won.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean she got it.</v>

984
00:44:05.970 --> 00:44:08.270
<v Speaker 1>Do you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know that's unusual because</v>

985
00:44:08.271 --> 00:44:11.000
<v Speaker 1>California is usually outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gets not in California,</v>

986
00:44:11.001 --> 00:44:13.160
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it tends to have pretty good,</v>

987
00:44:13.610 --> 00:44:16.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pro family surrogacy laws by which I</v>

988
00:44:16.491 --> 00:44:18.250
<v Speaker 1>mean it makes it hard for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

989
00:44:18.251 --> 00:44:23.120
<v Speaker 1>I get to change your mind at the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the end we'll they did in 2000 it was</v>

990
00:44:23.121 --> 00:44:26.350
<v Speaker 1>like early 2000 Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That might changed somewhere in do</v>

991
00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:28.670
<v Speaker 1>bloody Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

992
00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:32.040
<v Speaker 1>let me whine for a moment about how</v>
<v Speaker 1>backward Australia was 10 or 15</v>

993
00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:33.960
<v Speaker 3>years ago when I first started coming to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the states,</v>

994
00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:39.030
<v Speaker 3>I was able to look down my progressive</v>
<v Speaker 3>knows at these fine United States of</v>

995
00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:41.700
<v Speaker 3>America and think of it as being a more</v>
<v Speaker 3>conservative center,</v>

996
00:44:41.701 --> 00:44:44.580
<v Speaker 3>right country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But now you guys are legalizing pot all</v>

997
00:44:44.581 --> 00:44:46.140
<v Speaker 3>over the joint.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got the gay marriage.</v>

998
00:44:46.141 --> 00:44:50.640
<v Speaker 3>Australia still doesn't like a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like a lot of interesting stuff</v>

999
00:44:50.641 --> 00:44:54.390
<v Speaker 3>is going on in the states,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in on the progressive side of politics</v>

1000
00:44:54.391 --> 00:44:57.630
<v Speaker 3>and culture that Australia has just been</v>
<v Speaker 3>too slow to pick up.</v>

1001
00:44:57.631 --> 00:44:59.490
<v Speaker 3>So on the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the question of surrogacy,</v>

1002
00:44:59.790 --> 00:45:04.620
<v Speaker 3>there's this weird like alliance in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Australia that also exist in some</v>

1003
00:45:04.890 --> 00:45:09.890
<v Speaker 3>communities here in the states between</v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially extreme feminists and like</v>

1004
00:45:10.021 --> 00:45:15.021
<v Speaker 3>right wing Christians to say that women</v>
<v Speaker 3>should not be allowed to take money to b</v>

1005
00:45:17.010 --> 00:45:21.690
<v Speaker 3>Sarragut carriers from the Christian</v>
<v Speaker 3>riot.</v>

1006
00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:23.310
<v Speaker 3>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1007
00:45:23.311 --> 00:45:24.930
<v Speaker 3>we shouldn't let these fags,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1008
00:45:24.931 --> 00:45:27.690
<v Speaker 3>be using women to about an hour to</v>
<v Speaker 3>create life,</v>

1009
00:45:28.090 --> 00:45:30.810
<v Speaker 3>God forbid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And from the feminists it's,</v>

1010
00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:32.940
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have to protect women from being</v>

1011
00:45:32.941 --> 00:45:37.560
<v Speaker 3>manipulated and taking money for having,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for renting their wounds out.</v>

1012
00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:41.830
<v Speaker 3>But you want them to have the right to</v>
<v Speaker 3>kill a,</v>

1013
00:45:42.210 --> 00:45:43.230
<v Speaker 3>an unborn baby.</v>

1014
00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:44.530
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1015
00:45:44.530 --> 00:45:45.341
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that.</v>

1016
00:45:45.341 --> 00:45:47.410
<v Speaker 1>It's what you don't want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a medical procedure.</v>

1017
00:45:47.530 --> 00:45:51.300
<v Speaker 1>It's not telling you baby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a bundle of cells until it comes to</v>

1018
00:45:51.310 --> 00:45:54.490
<v Speaker 1>batch of cells and then all of a sudden</v>
<v Speaker 1>until it gets a social security number.</v>

1019
00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:55.353
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not real.</v>

1020
00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:58.210
<v Speaker 3>So you want a woman to be able to kill</v>
<v Speaker 3>that bunch of cells,</v>

1021
00:45:58.211 --> 00:46:00.520
<v Speaker 3>but you don't want her to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 3>bring that bunch of cells into</v>

1022
00:46:00.521 --> 00:46:02.500
<v Speaker 3>existence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then get paid for it.</v>

1023
00:46:02.530 --> 00:46:03.460
<v Speaker 3>In Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't.</v>

1024
00:46:03.461 --> 00:46:07.440
<v Speaker 3>It's against the law to be pet to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to pay a surrogate to carry your child.</v>

1025
00:46:07.441 --> 00:46:08.770
<v Speaker 3>It has to be a favor,</v>

1026
00:46:09.090 --> 00:46:14.090
<v Speaker 1>but prostitution's legal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys are just confused.</v>

1027
00:46:14.341 --> 00:46:16.770
<v Speaker 1>We were confused.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nation lost on the wrong side of the</v>

1075
00:48:20.250 --> 00:48:21.083
<v Speaker 5>they were probably bigger.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I think they've always been bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hello?</v>

1077
00:48:23.561 --> 00:48:25.360
<v Speaker 5>Americans are giving them a run for</v>
<v Speaker 5>their money right now.</v>

1078
00:48:25.361 --> 00:48:27.370
<v Speaker 5>And a stand I was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's starting to get fat.</v>

1079
00:48:27.570 --> 00:48:28.840
<v Speaker 5>Well it's food,</v>
<v Speaker 5>foods,</v>

1080
00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:31.750
<v Speaker 5>the high protein count.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean you've seen it in Japan as well.</v>

1081
00:48:32.050 --> 00:48:33.460
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people are just larger,</v>

1082
00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:35.460
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're eating more food and,</v>

1083
00:48:35.530 --> 00:48:38.800
<v Speaker 5>and we're eating more sugar that too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well there's also the,</v>

1084
00:48:38.850 --> 00:48:42.010
<v Speaker 5>I had Gary Tobbs on who wrote that book</v>
<v Speaker 5>the case against sugar.</v>

1085
00:48:42.011 --> 00:48:42.940
<v Speaker 5>And one of the things that he was</v>
<v Speaker 5>saying,</v>

1086
00:48:42.941 --> 00:48:46.690
<v Speaker 5>it was really kind of interesting is</v>
<v Speaker 5>that when you feed people a higher sugar</v>

1087
00:48:46.691 --> 00:48:49.540
<v Speaker 5>diet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the higher insulin count is actually</v>

1088
00:48:49.541 --> 00:48:53.470
<v Speaker 5>making larger people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he's talking about his kids and that</v>

1089
00:48:53.471 --> 00:48:56.830
<v Speaker 5>like you almost like wants to feed his</v>
<v Speaker 5>kids more sugar to make,</v>

<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>bigger athletes.</v>

1092
00:48:59.321 --> 00:49:01.570
<v Speaker 5>So big or not in terms of having more</v>
<v Speaker 5>body fat,</v>

1097
00:49:08.260 --> 00:49:12.220
<v Speaker 5>There's some evidence that points to the</v>
<v Speaker 5>high sugar diet as well as the high</v>

1098
00:49:12.221 --> 00:49:15.820
<v Speaker 5>protein diet are contributing factors to</v>
<v Speaker 5>people being larger.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Gary Topp said.</v>

1110
00:49:45.130 --> 00:49:47.580
<v Speaker 5>Jamie's Colin's a liability of being Joe</v>
<v Speaker 5>Rogan story.</v>

1111
00:49:47.590 --> 00:49:49.660
<v Speaker 5>The other day I showed you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is after the show.</v>

1112
00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:52.390
<v Speaker 5>Let's get [inaudible] spilling onto</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wisconsin highway.</v>

1113
00:49:52.391 --> 00:49:53.770
<v Speaker 5>We're headed for cattle feed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

1114
00:49:53.771 --> 00:49:55.900
<v Speaker 5>they do do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They give it the cows candy.</v>

1115
00:49:55.990 --> 00:49:57.330
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's just to fatten them up the</v>

1116
00:49:57.360 --> 00:49:58.193
<v Speaker 5>cheaper.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1117
00:49:58.210 --> 00:49:58.991
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

1118
00:49:58.991 --> 00:50:01.420
<v Speaker 5>They do do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They feed cows candy to make them</v>

1119
00:50:01.421 --> 00:50:02.920
<v Speaker 5>fatter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They've done,</v>

1120
00:50:03.250 --> 00:50:06.190
<v Speaker 5>they also feed them antibiotics just to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just to make them bigger,</v>

1121
00:50:06.191 --> 00:50:08.680
<v Speaker 5>just to make them grow faster.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh actually the reason why they feed</v>

1122
00:50:08.681 --> 00:50:12.170
<v Speaker 5>them antibiotics is their bodies reject</v>
<v Speaker 5>the grain there,</v>

1123
00:50:12.250 --> 00:50:15.490
<v Speaker 5>feed them corn and things like that and</v>
<v Speaker 5>they develop abscesses and their books</v>

1124
00:50:15.491 --> 00:50:18.190
<v Speaker 5>to affections to fall.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Apparently it's for that reason.</v>

1125
00:50:18.191 --> 00:50:21.400
<v Speaker 5>And also it just has this side,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the byproducts that it makes them grow</v>

1126
00:50:21.401 --> 00:50:22.780
<v Speaker 5>faster.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Antibiotics,</v>

1127
00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:23.850
<v Speaker 5>antibiotics.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>

<v Speaker 1>But you should be real careful about</v>

1134
00:50:33.951 --> 00:50:36.920
<v Speaker 1>taking them for like little colds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm just going to take a z pack.</v>

1135

<v Speaker 1>And if you do,</v>

1138
00:50:40.311 --> 00:50:42.170
<v Speaker 1>then make sure that you take probiotics</v>
<v Speaker 1>and shit.</v>

1139
00:50:42.171 --> 00:50:44.120
<v Speaker 1>Eat a lot of Kimchi and sauerkraut and</v>

00:50:50.210 --> 00:50:50.931
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1144

<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's,</v>

00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:53.870
<v Speaker 1>she's good value isn't she?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's a genius.</v>

1146
00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:55.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1147
00:50:55.220 --> 00:50:56.960
<v Speaker 1>she's making a person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if she's going to feed it</v>

1148
00:50:56.961 --> 00:50:58.490
<v Speaker 1>sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How old?</v>

1149
00:50:58.530 --> 00:50:59.690
<v Speaker 1>How long?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How far along was it?</v>

1150
00:50:59.691 --> 00:51:00.980
<v Speaker 1>Third Person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Third Trimester.</v>

1151
00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:01.873
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1152
00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:05.270
<v Speaker 1>I needed to learn all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not good with like the numbers of</v>

1153
00:51:05.271 --> 00:51:06.350
<v Speaker 1>human physiology.</v>

1154
00:51:06.410 --> 00:51:08.710
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know what a trimester was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's difficult.</v>

1155
00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:12.260
<v Speaker 1>You're a guy cause I don't have a slide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have cycles.</v>

1156
00:51:12.261 --> 00:51:15.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't have the cycles of the men</v>
<v Speaker 1>steroid administration and the moon and</v>

1157
00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:17.360
<v Speaker 1>the tide comes in and the tide goes out</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the blood comes in,</v>

1158
00:51:17.361 --> 00:51:19.760
<v Speaker 1>into the band comes out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's impossible to explain and the baby</v>

1159
00:51:19.761 --> 00:51:20.720
<v Speaker 1>comes out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sweet baby.</v>

1160
00:51:20.721 --> 00:51:22.790
<v Speaker 1>Jesus is the only explanation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>

1161
00:51:23.210 --> 00:51:26.120
<v Speaker 1>So explain to me what the law is right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now in Australia.</v>

1162
00:51:26.121 --> 00:51:28.700
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you hire a surrogate or is it being</v>

1163
00:51:28.701 --> 00:51:30.890
<v Speaker 1>pushed back?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a state by state thing cause</v>

1164
00:51:30.891 --> 00:51:33.200
<v Speaker 1>the strategy of results.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a federation like the United States,</v>

1165
00:51:33.201 --> 00:51:34.850
<v Speaker 1>which he used to be a bunch of separate</v>
<v Speaker 1>colonies.</v>

1166
00:51:34.851 --> 00:51:36.050
<v Speaker 1>So it used to be a bunch of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1167
00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:39.410
<v Speaker 1>penal colonies that Britain basically</v>
<v Speaker 1>after the American revolution,</v>

1168
00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:41.990
<v Speaker 1>Britain had no where to send its</v>
<v Speaker 1>criminals.</v>

1169
00:51:41.991 --> 00:51:45.110
<v Speaker 1>And it was a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very tough law and order states in the</v>

1170
00:51:45.111 --> 00:51:47.030
<v Speaker 1>17 hundreds in the UK.</v>

1171
00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:49.760
<v Speaker 1>Like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was three strikes and you're out.</v>

1172
00:51:49.761 --> 00:51:52.340
<v Speaker 1>That wasn't even in the start of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was incredible inequality.</v>

1173
00:51:52.341 --> 00:51:55.880
<v Speaker 1>There was no welfare obviously and no</v>
<v Speaker 1>food stamps and shit like that.</v>

1174
00:51:55.881 --> 00:52:00.881
<v Speaker 1>So people who were starving would steal</v>
<v Speaker 1>a loaf of bread and you do that twice</v>

1175
00:52:01.431 --> 00:52:02.270
<v Speaker 1>and they'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

1176
00:52:02.271 --> 00:52:04.850
<v Speaker 1>we're going to send you to the moon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is essentially a strategy.</v>

1177
00:52:05.030 --> 00:52:06.200
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they went and found,</v>

1178
00:52:06.201 --> 00:52:10.160
<v Speaker 1>they discovered this great southern land</v>
<v Speaker 1>that had been rumored about and had been</v>

1179
00:52:10.161 --> 00:52:14.210
<v Speaker 1>kind of sketched on the edges by some of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the explorers from the Netherlands and</v>

1180
00:52:14.211 --> 00:52:18.290
<v Speaker 1>from France so far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they sent out captain cook to settle</v>

1181
00:52:18.291 --> 00:52:21.200
<v Speaker 1>it basically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they would have a place for creative</v>

1182
00:52:21.201 --> 00:52:26.150
<v Speaker 1>criminals to examine a huge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vast sunburnt land for criminals to to</v>

1183
00:52:26.151 --> 00:52:28.600
<v Speaker 1>run free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now that they could no longer use</v>

1184
00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:30.170
<v Speaker 1>United States any of those colonies.</v>

1185
00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:34.280
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the most beautiful places in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world and some of the nicest people</v>

1186
00:52:34.281 --> 00:52:35.750
<v Speaker 1>in the world lived there like they</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked up.</v>

1187
00:52:35.751 --> 00:52:39.480
<v Speaker 1>They made it a better place than ain't</v>
<v Speaker 1>sent the criminals and the criminals.</v>

1188
00:52:39.510 --> 00:52:40.610
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what our problem was?</v>

1189
00:52:40.611 --> 00:52:42.620
<v Speaker 1>We were living in fucking England.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It never,</v>

1190
00:52:42.740 --> 00:52:46.610
<v Speaker 1>it's never sunny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are constantly bars or a thousand</v>

1191
00:52:46.610 --> 00:52:47.930
<v Speaker 1>years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ,</v>

1192
00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:50.000
<v Speaker 1>I feel so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be a criminal anymore.</v>

1193
00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:53.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go south and Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh please judge.</v>

1194
00:52:53.601 --> 00:52:56.720
<v Speaker 1>Don't send me to the other side of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world to a tropical paradise when I</v>

1195
00:52:56.721 --> 00:52:59.780
<v Speaker 1>could be living here in London where</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's dirty and disease written and it's</v>

1196
00:52:59.781 --> 00:53:02.970
<v Speaker 1>rainy and drizzly and gray all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But isn't it of bid?</v>

1197
00:53:03.070 --> 00:53:05.270
<v Speaker 1>How there's a balance to everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause when you go to Australia,</v>

1198
00:53:05.271 --> 00:53:07.130
<v Speaker 1>everything can fucking kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1199
00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:08.930
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of the problem is,</v>

1200
00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:10.450
<v Speaker 1>but goddamn box,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jelly,</v>

1201
00:53:10.451 --> 00:53:13.610
<v Speaker 1>fish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brown spiders and Brown snakes and all</v>

1202
00:53:13.611 --> 00:53:14.270
<v Speaker 1>these different things.</v>

1203
00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:17.480
<v Speaker 1>It can fuck you up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't feel afraid of that when</v>

1204
00:53:17.481 --> 00:53:20.060
<v Speaker 1>you're in Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you you get over that and 24 hours?</v>

1205
00:53:20.090 --> 00:53:20.691
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not me.</v>

1206
00:53:20.691 --> 00:53:23.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm a POC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Terrified of bugs and snakes and shit.</v>

1207
00:53:24.050 --> 00:53:26.580
<v Speaker 1>Cause I'm the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you do to typically that you're</v>

1208
00:53:26.581 --> 00:53:30.270
<v Speaker 1>much more likely to be killed in it on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the freeway here in la or by someone</v>

1209
00:53:30.271 --> 00:53:32.550
<v Speaker 1>shooting you in the states than you are</v>
<v Speaker 1>by appspider.</v>

1210
00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:35.910
<v Speaker 1>Biden say bless you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go near the spiders and the snakes,</v>

1211
00:53:36.900 --> 00:53:39.090
<v Speaker 1>which is what I would do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me know the problem with me,</v>

1212
00:53:39.091 --> 00:53:41.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't approach them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll have a buddy of mine,</v>

1213
00:53:41.251 --> 00:53:43.500
<v Speaker 1>my friend Adam Green tree was a big bow</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunter in Australia.</v>

1214
00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:44.970
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So He's trying to get me to go hang out</v>

1215
00:53:44.971 --> 00:53:46.780
<v Speaker 1>with them and I'm always like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1216
00:53:46.781 --> 00:53:47.151
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1217
00:53:47.151 --> 00:53:47.970
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll do that.</v>

1218
00:53:47.970 --> 00:53:51.960
<v Speaker 1>And then they send me a picture of some</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking spider that a vicious poisonous</v>

1219
00:53:51.961 --> 00:53:54.030
<v Speaker 1>spider eating a vicious poisonous snake.</v>

1220
00:53:54.670 --> 00:53:56.430
<v Speaker 1>The fuck do you live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1221
00:53:56.730 --> 00:53:59.280
<v Speaker 1>this is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crocodiles everywhere.</v>

1222
00:53:59.490 --> 00:54:02.880
<v Speaker 1>They went hunting and they didn't bring</v>
<v Speaker 1>any water and they just figured they</v>

1223
00:54:02.881 --> 00:54:06.540
<v Speaker 1>would find water and they use water</v>
<v Speaker 1>purification systems and cleaned it out.</v>

1224
00:54:06.541 --> 00:54:09.810
<v Speaker 1>So they're drinking buffalo piss water</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause he's water buffaloes.</v>

1225
00:54:09.811 --> 00:54:13.830
<v Speaker 1>They piss in this water and then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have these filter pumps and you pump out</v>

1226
00:54:13.831 --> 00:54:17.010
<v Speaker 1>all the toxins but it still tastes like</v>
<v Speaker 1>piss because you're essentially drinking</v>

1227
00:54:17.100 --> 00:54:21.990
<v Speaker 1>purified pests and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were cooling off in this water and</v>

1228
00:54:22.020 --> 00:54:23.880
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't realize that there's</v>

1229
00:54:23.881 --> 00:54:25.190
<v Speaker 1>crocodiles in the area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

1230
00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:28.830
<v Speaker 1>So they easily could've got checked by a</v>
<v Speaker 1>crocodile crocodile slide into that</v>

1231
00:54:28.831 --> 00:54:31.140
<v Speaker 1>water and they just sit and wait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's one of those things that you</v>

1232
00:54:31.141 --> 00:54:32.910
<v Speaker 1>just led about as a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a bit like,</v>

1233
00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:35.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean people like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like when you talk to Canadians</v>

1234
00:54:35.341 --> 00:54:38.460
<v Speaker 1>about the risk of bears and they just</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of laugh it off because you learn</v>

1235
00:54:38.461 --> 00:54:40.770
<v Speaker 1>about how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or like people from Finland about</v>

1236
00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:42.780
<v Speaker 1>falling through the ice on a frozen</v>
<v Speaker 1>lake.</v>

1237
00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:44.970
<v Speaker 1>These are just things that you learn</v>
<v Speaker 1>about when you're a kid and you just</v>

1238
00:54:44.971 --> 00:54:47.370
<v Speaker 1>take it for granted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know where they will be.</v>

1239
00:54:47.371 --> 00:54:51.930
<v Speaker 1>Crocodiles 99% of the time and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to those places and I certainly</v>

1240
00:54:51.931 --> 00:54:53.310
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well sure,</v>

1241
00:54:53.370 --> 00:54:54.210
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1242
00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:58.410
<v Speaker 1>Get ready.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Farmer will be be with a group of</v>

1243
00:54:58.411 --> 00:54:59.910
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean in terms of the,</v>

1244
00:54:59.911 --> 00:55:02.700
<v Speaker 1>in terms of like how good it was for</v>
<v Speaker 1>convicts.</v>

1245
00:55:02.701 --> 00:55:04.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean people came out to Australia for</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1246
00:55:04.980 --> 00:55:08.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brits came out to Australia even if they</v>

1247
00:55:08.011 --> 00:55:09.930
<v Speaker 1>weren't criminals just because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted a new,</v>

1248
00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:12.180
<v Speaker 1>like a new adventure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1249
00:55:12.181 --> 00:55:14.400
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and some of the states of Australia</v>

1250
00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:17.520
<v Speaker 1>actually we're free settler colonies</v>
<v Speaker 1>like South Australia,</v>

1251
00:55:17.521 --> 00:55:19.680
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the states was never a</v>
<v Speaker 1>convict,</v>

1252
00:55:19.710 --> 00:55:22.020
<v Speaker 1>a penal colony.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in fact,</v>

1253
00:55:22.021 --> 00:55:26.160
<v Speaker 1>when Australia became a country in 1901,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they w in the constitutional conventions</v>

1254
00:55:26.161 --> 00:55:27.360
<v Speaker 1>in the eighties and nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

1255
00:55:27.361 --> 00:55:30.750
<v Speaker 1>which created a country out of all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>these previously separate colonies,</v>

1256
00:55:30.990 --> 00:55:34.080
<v Speaker 1>New Zealand within negotiations to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of that country as well.</v>

1257
00:55:34.260 --> 00:55:36.150
<v Speaker 1>And Western Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the western half of the</v>

1258
00:55:36.151 --> 00:55:37.890
<v Speaker 1>continent was going to be a separate</v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

1259
00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:41.370
<v Speaker 1>And the eastern half,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the eastern states of Australia and New</v>

1260
00:55:41.370 --> 00:55:43.590
<v Speaker 1>Zealand could have been a single</v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

1261
00:55:43.591 --> 00:55:45.900
<v Speaker 1>And then at the last minute and New</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zealand jumped out in Western Australia,</v>

1262
00:55:45.901 --> 00:55:48.930
<v Speaker 1>jumped in and now you've got two</v>
<v Speaker 1>different countries.</v>

1263
00:55:49.230 --> 00:55:51.690
<v Speaker 1>But Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh this massive huntsman spider in</v>

1264
00:55:51.691 --> 00:55:52.740
<v Speaker 1>Australia is what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1265
00:55:52.741 --> 00:55:54.420
<v Speaker 1>but huntsman's aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't hurt you.</v>

1266
00:55:54.540 --> 00:55:55.760
<v Speaker 1>It gives a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kill Them.</v>

1267
00:55:56.210 --> 00:55:58.750
<v Speaker 1>When you get those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get those spiders,</v>

1268
00:56:00.090 --> 00:56:04.170
<v Speaker 1>spiders inside even in Sydney,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then on size harmful God damn giant</v>

1269
00:56:04.171 --> 00:56:05.910
<v Speaker 1>crab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's huge.</v>

1270
00:56:05.911 --> 00:56:07.100
<v Speaker 1>It's on a broom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not,</v>

1271
00:56:07.101 --> 00:56:09.930
<v Speaker 1>you can tell that it's big enough to</v>
<v Speaker 1>scare the fuck out of you.</v>

1272
00:56:09.931 --> 00:56:11.460
<v Speaker 1>If it was in your underwear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you die.</v>

1273
00:56:11.670 --> 00:56:16.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know New Zealand is a place that's</v>

1274
00:56:16.891 --> 00:56:21.270
<v Speaker 1>really fascinating because they brought</v>
<v Speaker 1>over all these wild game animals from</v>

1275
00:56:21.271 --> 00:56:24.040
<v Speaker 1>other countries to turn it into a</v>
<v Speaker 1>paradise.</v>

1276
00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:27.850
<v Speaker 1>And I think they did in the 17 hundreds</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the 1800 it would have been insane.</v>

1277
00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:30.610
<v Speaker 1>Hundreds cause I think it was only</v>
<v Speaker 1>settled by white people in the 17</v>

1278
00:56:30.611 --> 00:56:33.730
<v Speaker 1>hundreds yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now they're the run rampant around</v>

1279
00:56:33.731 --> 00:56:38.170
<v Speaker 1>the island cause there's no predators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they have these hordes of red stags</v>

1280
00:56:38.171 --> 00:56:40.910
<v Speaker 1>from Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're wandering around New Zealand.</v>

1281
00:56:41.650 --> 00:56:44.620
<v Speaker 1>We spoke last time about the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the attempt that New Zealand is</v>

1282
00:56:44.621 --> 00:56:47.380
<v Speaker 1>doing to basically eradicate all of its</v>
<v Speaker 1>predators,</v>

1283
00:56:47.381 --> 00:56:50.680
<v Speaker 1>all of its invasive predators who that</v>
<v Speaker 1>have come from abroad like New Zealand</v>

1284
00:56:50.710 --> 00:56:55.350
<v Speaker 1>because it was the last country to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>settled by white people by White Farnaz</v>

1285
00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:57.010
<v Speaker 1>that is who brought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1286
00:56:57.011 --> 00:56:59.680
<v Speaker 1>foxes and rabbits and whatever nasty</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1287
00:56:59.681 --> 00:57:02.080
<v Speaker 1>I always forget exactly what called cats</v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

1288
00:57:02.590 --> 00:57:05.020
<v Speaker 1>I can't even remember what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time I say this publicly,</v>

1289
00:57:05.021 --> 00:57:06.340
<v Speaker 1>someone from New Zealand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

1290
00:57:06.370 --> 00:57:08.680
<v Speaker 1>actually we don't have Fox News on</v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter,</v>

1291
00:57:08.710 --> 00:57:11.860
<v Speaker 1>so I definitely do in Australia caddy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and have the same issue.</v>

1292
00:57:11.860 --> 00:57:13.780
<v Speaker 1>You have the same issue in Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally,</v>

1293
00:57:13.840 --> 00:57:15.610
<v Speaker 1>totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in Australia it's too far gone.</v>

1294
00:57:15.611 --> 00:57:17.740
<v Speaker 1>There's no way that you would be able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually eradicate them.</v>

1295
00:57:17.741 --> 00:57:19.450
<v Speaker 1>Whereas in New Zealand there is like it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

1296
00:57:19.480 --> 00:57:23.860
<v Speaker 1>it is a New Zealand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his patriotic duty to murder as many</v>

1297
00:57:23.950 --> 00:57:28.120
<v Speaker 1>little mammals as they can because those</v>
<v Speaker 1>little mammals eat the night of birds</v>

1298
00:57:28.121 --> 00:57:29.800
<v Speaker 1>and eat all the native wildlife and</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

1299
00:57:29.801 --> 00:57:31.660
<v Speaker 1>So New Zealand is like my cousins over</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1300
00:57:31.960 --> 00:57:35.450
<v Speaker 1>They set traps out in their yard and</v>
<v Speaker 1>every morning they go down like they</v>

1301
00:57:35.480 --> 00:57:38.890
<v Speaker 1>with bloodied hands pulling out the</v>
<v Speaker 1>caucus is of animals that they've killed</v>

1302
00:57:39.070 --> 00:57:39.731
<v Speaker 1>and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

1303
00:57:39.731 --> 00:57:41.230
<v Speaker 1>this good job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good for you.</v>

1304
00:57:41.410 --> 00:57:46.410
<v Speaker 1>Well Australia a bit bow hunting</v>
<v Speaker 1>magazines show people holding cats up</v>

1305
00:57:46.590 --> 00:57:50.200
<v Speaker 1>like domestic cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hold them and you gotta like an Arrow</v>

1306
00:57:50.201 --> 00:57:53.200
<v Speaker 1>through the heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there was a guy recently who got</v>

1307
00:57:53.201 --> 00:57:57.130
<v Speaker 1>attacked on instagram because he's an</v>
<v Speaker 1>Australian bow hunter and he's out bow</v>

1308
00:57:57.131 --> 00:57:59.680
<v Speaker 1>hunting and he killed this cat and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people were freaking out.</v>

1309
00:57:59.740 --> 00:58:01.540
<v Speaker 1>That was some of these pat you piece of</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

1310
00:58:01.541 --> 00:58:04.760
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually you don't understand this is</v>

1311
00:58:04.810 --> 00:58:09.040
<v Speaker 1>the ruining the ground nesting birds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these different animals that live in</v>

1312
00:58:09.041 --> 00:58:11.050
<v Speaker 1>the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that mean to the animals that have never</v>

1313
00:58:11.051 --> 00:58:13.660
<v Speaker 1>had a Predator to like that and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>missed or do just getting destroyed.</v>

1314
00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:16.000
<v Speaker 1>They're a menace that as cats they get</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

1315
00:58:16.310 --> 00:58:17.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hopeless</v>

1316
00:58:19.150 --> 00:58:21.700
<v Speaker 1>on the question of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't that beautiful,</v>

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1319
00:58:25.300 --> 00:58:27.170
<v Speaker 1>I left someone off fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>went off.</v>

1320
00:58:27.370 --> 00:58:29.760

<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

<v Speaker 1>But I worked out today pretty hard.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Lifting weights.</v>

1324

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1325
00:58:37.721 --> 00:58:38.554
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

1326
00:58:41.070 --> 00:58:43.060
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>animals too?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forgot.</v>

1328
00:58:44.660 --> 00:58:45.970
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1329
00:58:45.971 --> 00:58:46.900

<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1330
00:58:46.901 --> 00:58:49.480
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing that there is imbalanced.</v>

1331
00:58:49.510 --> 00:58:50.710
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what it was.</v>

1332
00:58:51.030 --> 00:58:52.780
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a Tasmanian tiger,</v>

1333
00:58:52.840 --> 00:58:55.620
<v Speaker 1>which was an animal that was extinct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1334
00:58:55.630 --> 00:58:59.230
<v Speaker 1>Apparently there's a bunch of sightings</v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing and they're pretty sure that</v>

1335
00:58:59.231 --> 00:59:01.450
<v Speaker 1>it might actually still be alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've read that.</v>

1336
00:59:01.540 --> 00:59:02.840
<v Speaker 1>I hope so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be,</v>

1337
00:59:02.910 --> 00:59:04.780
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this really depressing footage.</v>

1338
00:59:04.781 --> 00:59:06.250
<v Speaker 1>You can say it online of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1339
00:59:06.251 --> 00:59:08.470
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last day of a Tasmanian tiger eye in</v>

1340
00:59:08.471 --> 00:59:09.390
<v Speaker 1>a zoo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1341
00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:11.470
<v Speaker 1>just pacing back and forth and back and</v>
<v Speaker 1>forth,</v>

1342
00:59:11.510 --> 00:59:13.540
<v Speaker 1>wiped it out completely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>1930s.</v>

1343
00:59:13.541 --> 00:59:14.670
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1344
00:59:14.680 --> 00:59:16.120
<v Speaker 1>Footage it really early.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1345
00:59:16.121 --> 00:59:18.130
<v Speaker 1>they basically destroyed everything in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tasmania.</v>

1346
00:59:18.131 --> 00:59:20.240
<v Speaker 1>They wiped out the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the night of aboriginal through and</v>

1347
00:59:20.250 --> 00:59:21.650
<v Speaker 1>wiped out the paypal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wiped out.</v>

1348
00:59:21.710 --> 00:59:22.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>

1349
00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:23.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Haley,</v>

1350
00:59:23.710 --> 00:59:24.980
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the British empire.</v>

1351
00:59:25.010 --> 00:59:28.270
<v Speaker 1>Let's make things better by killing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything is interesting.</v>

1352
00:59:28.540 --> 00:59:31.460
<v Speaker 1>Do you guys change the British accent?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a little.</v>

1353
00:59:31.910 --> 00:59:34.820
<v Speaker 1>Whereas like most Americans can't tell</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the fuck you're from.</v>

1354
00:59:34.880 --> 00:59:36.680
<v Speaker 1>How do you not tell?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Honestly,</v>

1355
00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:38.450
<v Speaker 1>it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the same thing.</v>

1356
00:59:38.451 --> 00:59:41.150
<v Speaker 1>It's obviously not in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been half up.</v>

1357
00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:43.790
<v Speaker 1>You're not from here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell the difference between</v>

1358
00:59:43.791 --> 00:59:46.250
<v Speaker 1>Canadian and American.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's easy.</v>

1359
00:59:46.760 --> 00:59:48.380
<v Speaker 1>Done easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause you were American as soon as you</v>

1360
00:59:48.381 --> 00:59:49.700
<v Speaker 1>hear a boat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1361
00:59:49.850 --> 00:59:52.700
<v Speaker 1>But then they're nicer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean actually that is less different</v>

1362
00:59:52.701 --> 00:59:54.500
<v Speaker 1>than the difference between British and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Australian.</v>

1363
00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:57.620
<v Speaker 1>Consider a place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you tell us what's going on in New</v>

1364
00:59:57.620 --> 01:00:00.890
<v Speaker 1>Zealand and Arizona accent and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>California accent?</v>

1365
01:00:01.810 --> 01:00:04.310
<v Speaker 1>Don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neither one have one.</v>

1366
01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:05.593
<v Speaker 1>It was a trick question.</v>

1367
01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:10.580
<v Speaker 1>Come on with an Arizona accident.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is in Arizona accent?</v>

1368
01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:12.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the only American accent so that I</v>

1369
01:00:12.021 --> 01:00:14.060
<v Speaker 1>can easily pick apart from the big city</v>
<v Speaker 1>ones.</v>

1370
01:00:14.061 --> 01:00:16.670
<v Speaker 1>Cause you can tell Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can tell in New York he can,</v>

1371
01:00:16.730 --> 01:00:18.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a bet.</v>

1372
01:00:18.020 --> 01:00:22.720
<v Speaker 1>That's basically it is the south.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See there's that midwestern thing where</v>

1373
01:00:22.730 --> 01:00:26.000
<v Speaker 1>like Minnesota and Wisconsin and have</v>
<v Speaker 1>that all that cane,</v>

1374
01:00:26.010 --> 01:00:28.890
<v Speaker 1>da Fargo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of Fargo.</v>

1375
01:00:28.891 --> 01:00:30.170
<v Speaker 1>We accent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1376
01:00:30.190 --> 01:00:31.160
<v Speaker 1>and then you've got the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1377
01:00:31.161 --> 01:00:34.820
<v Speaker 1>the west coast thing and then the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that Fargo thing is similar to</v>

1378
01:00:34.821 --> 01:00:36.110
<v Speaker 1>Canadian as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A little bit.</v>

1379
01:00:36.111 --> 01:00:38.510
<v Speaker 1>It gets a little bit confusing sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're a foreigner,</v>

1380
01:00:38.511 --> 01:00:40.490
<v Speaker 1>like myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Friendly people that live in the cold.</v>

1381
01:00:41.300 --> 01:00:42.830
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1382
01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:45.650
<v Speaker 1>They have to be like helping each other</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

1383
01:00:45.770 --> 01:00:47.390
<v Speaker 1>Sense of community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Canadians.</v>

1384
01:00:47.391 --> 01:00:48.790
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of like aussies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1385
01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:50.360
<v Speaker 1>they were also big landmass.</v>

1386
01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:52.880
<v Speaker 1>Not very many people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mostly in hospital.</v>

1387
01:00:53.270 --> 01:00:56.580
<v Speaker 1>Most of them are huddled along one</v>
<v Speaker 1>stretch of land in,</v>

1388
01:00:56.780 --> 01:00:58.520
<v Speaker 1>in Canada it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the border.</v>

1389
01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:00.490
<v Speaker 1>And in Australia it's the coastline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1390
01:01:00.610 --> 01:01:02.870
<v Speaker 1>I think they have less people than</v>
<v Speaker 1>California as well.</v>

1391
01:01:03.230 --> 01:01:04.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have about the same I think.</v>

1392
01:01:04.581 --> 01:01:05.930
<v Speaker 1>I think they have a bit more than</v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia.</v>

1393
01:01:05.990 --> 01:01:08.000
<v Speaker 1>I feel like 50 million or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1394
01:01:08.090 --> 01:01:09.590
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1395
01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:11.390
<v Speaker 1>I'd moved there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the two places I'd moved.</v>

1396
01:01:11.391 --> 01:01:12.770
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I didn't live in America,</v>

1397
01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:16.250
<v Speaker 1>like if some shit hit the fan here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if California,</v>

1398
01:01:16.890 --> 01:01:19.010
<v Speaker 1>California slid into the ocean and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>big earthquake or something,</v>

1399
01:01:19.420 --> 01:01:21.290
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would either live in Canada or</v>

1400
01:01:21.291 --> 01:01:22.540
<v Speaker 1>Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are two spots.</v>

1401
01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:24.770
<v Speaker 1>Hold Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you aware of that?</v>

1402
01:01:24.820 --> 01:01:27.500
<v Speaker 1>To be cold on Vancouver?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1403
01:01:27.501 --> 01:01:31.040
<v Speaker 1>but it's rainy and cloudy and gray.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful Green on the three days a</v>

1404
01:01:31.041 --> 01:01:32.600
<v Speaker 1>week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When it's a year,</v>

1405
01:01:32.601 --> 01:01:34.190
<v Speaker 1>when it's sunny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's beautiful.</v>

1406
01:01:34.250 --> 01:01:36.830
<v Speaker 1>People are cool as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>362 days a year.</v>

1407
01:01:37.550 --> 01:01:39.770
<v Speaker 1>Horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't be a pussy.</v>

1408
01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:43.580
<v Speaker 1>Chrisley so what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stay inside good strip down gets me</v>

1409
01:01:43.581 --> 01:01:47.070
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr [inaudible] tell you when it is</v>

1410
01:01:48.710 --> 01:01:51.410
<v Speaker 1>something</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

1411
01:01:51.411 --> 01:01:55.070
<v Speaker 1>I guess I get seasonal affective</v>
<v Speaker 1>disorder because my sister in law is</v>

1412
01:01:55.071 --> 01:01:58.370
<v Speaker 1>from Finland and when I go to Finland</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's gray and doc,</v>

1413
01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:01.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get sad.</v>

1414
01:02:02.210 --> 01:02:05.790
<v Speaker 1>I get sad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get sad and I actually,</v>

1415
01:02:05.791 --> 01:02:08.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind the cold called and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>under really frigid freezing.</v>

1416
01:02:08.961 --> 01:02:12.350
<v Speaker 1>Karl lived in New York for 10 ish years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on how you count it and the</v>

1417
01:02:12.410 --> 01:02:16.130
<v Speaker 1>and the winters out there when it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>crisp and bright and blue sky.</v>

1418
01:02:16.131 --> 01:02:19.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean you grew up in the north face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what that's like when it's a</v>

1419
01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:20.880
<v Speaker 1>nice day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't actually care if it's only five</v>

1420
01:02:20.881 --> 01:02:22.590
<v Speaker 1>degrees Fahrenheit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's,</v>

1421
01:02:22.950 --> 01:02:24.180
<v Speaker 1>if it's like sunny.</v>

1422
01:02:24.450 --> 01:02:27.180
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't like gloom New York and</v>

1423
01:02:27.181 --> 01:02:29.670
<v Speaker 1>Boston in particular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gets really gloomy in the winter.</v>

1424
01:02:29.820 --> 01:02:33.030
<v Speaker 1>I definitely think that affects people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I definitely used to affect me,</v>

1425
01:02:33.330 --> 01:02:35.880
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not as bad.</v>

1426
01:02:36.180 --> 01:02:41.180
<v Speaker 1>Like Colorado gets super fucking cold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's really sunny and Colorado</v>

1427
01:02:41.401 --> 01:02:43.170
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have any of that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

1428
01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:46.730
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not necessarily the cold as much as</v>

1429
01:02:46.780 --> 01:02:49.680
<v Speaker 1>it is the lack of Sun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need clear scars.</v>

1430
01:02:49.681 --> 01:02:51.000
<v Speaker 1>That's Ryan's feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1431
01:02:51.001 --> 01:02:53.710
<v Speaker 1>That's what I don't like about London</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Amsterdam and said he's like that as</v>

1432
01:02:53.730 --> 01:02:54.780
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seattle,</v>

1433
01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:57.000
<v Speaker 1>Portland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Portland Tomorrow Holla,</v>

1434
01:02:57.030 --> 01:02:58.350
<v Speaker 1>two shows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Great.</v>

1435
01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:00.690
<v Speaker 1>Nice city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>

1436
01:03:01.230 --> 01:03:02.640
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Portland's awesome.</v>

1437
01:03:03.150 --> 01:03:06.800
<v Speaker 1>How many days of the year does it rain?</v>
<v Speaker 1>289 days of sunshine in Vancouver.</v>

1438
01:03:06.850 --> 01:03:07.950
<v Speaker 1>That's what he's a pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

1439
01:03:07.951 --> 01:03:10.110
<v Speaker 1>What is Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you looking up here?</v>

1440
01:03:10.550 --> 01:03:13.860
<v Speaker 1>They comp results.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does say there's 166 days with</v>

1441
01:03:13.861 --> 01:03:16.480
<v Speaker 1>measurable precipitations that does a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bat up at the top.</v>

1442
01:03:16.490 --> 01:03:18.960
<v Speaker 1>It does because we're rains part of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>

1443
01:03:19.050 --> 01:03:22.500
<v Speaker 1>but hang on 299 days of sunshine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That just might mean that at some point</v>

1444
01:03:22.501 --> 01:03:25.020
<v Speaker 1>during the day there was a bit of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>glimmer of some,</v>

1445
01:03:25.021 --> 01:03:25.854
<v Speaker 1>that's all I need bro.</v>

1446
01:03:28.470 --> 01:03:32.700
<v Speaker 1>Just set up a little alarm to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know we're still on a planet.</v>

1447
01:03:32.730 --> 01:03:34.800
<v Speaker 1>I knew there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a bubbles.</v>

1448
01:03:35.150 --> 01:03:35.983
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1449
01:03:36.090 --> 01:03:39.000
<v Speaker 1>have you seen about um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the election in the cool,</v>

1450
01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:41.070
<v Speaker 1>quite a few stories coming out of Europe</v>
<v Speaker 1>this week.</v>

1451
01:03:41.300 --> 01:03:44.250
<v Speaker 1>I did a story I did my podcast today</v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

1452
01:03:44.490 --> 01:03:47.820
<v Speaker 1>there's the British prime minister just</v>
<v Speaker 1>called a snap election.</v>

1453
01:03:49.110 --> 01:03:53.460
<v Speaker 1>Try to reaffirm her mandate for brexit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the French had gone to the polls</v>

1454
01:03:53.461 --> 01:03:56.400
<v Speaker 1>next week and for the first round of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>presidential election,</v>

1455
01:03:56.401 --> 01:04:01.401
<v Speaker 1>which could see the far right leader,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marine Le Pen Win in France.</v>

1456
01:04:01.591 --> 01:04:04.050
<v Speaker 1>And if she does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she wants to crash out of the euro</v>

1457
01:04:04.051 --> 01:04:05.020
<v Speaker 1>currency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1458
01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:08.670
<v Speaker 1>break,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do frexit brexit crush any France leaves</v>

1459
01:04:08.671 --> 01:04:10.200
<v Speaker 1>the EU.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then that actually is all live.</v>

1460
01:04:10.201 --> 01:04:12.360
<v Speaker 1>I like penetration can leave if that</v>
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>

1461
01:04:12.361 --> 01:04:16.890
<v Speaker 1>When would France leave the EU?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw that there's massive antifascist</v>

1462
01:04:16.891 --> 01:04:17.820
<v Speaker 1>protest this week.</v>

1463
01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:20.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the way that their electoral system</v>

1464
01:04:20.641 --> 01:04:22.860
<v Speaker 1>works is they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of doing it all on one day,</v>

1465
01:04:22.861 --> 01:04:26.460
<v Speaker 1>they basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoever can run and get on the ballot,</v>

1466
01:04:26.630 --> 01:04:28.380
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's like maybe eight to 12</v>

1467
01:04:28.381 --> 01:04:30.360
<v Speaker 1>candidates who are on the ballot next</v>
<v Speaker 1>week.</v>

1468
01:04:30.390 --> 01:04:32.850
<v Speaker 1>And then assuming that one person</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't get one of them,</v>

1469
01:04:32.851 --> 01:04:35.400
<v Speaker 1>doesn't get more than 50% of the vote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I almost never do.</v>

1470
01:04:35.730 --> 01:04:37.770
<v Speaker 1>That then goes to a second round of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Palette,</v>

1471
01:04:37.830 --> 01:04:39.930
<v Speaker 1>which is next month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the actual presidential</v>

1472
01:04:39.931 --> 01:04:42.300
<v Speaker 1>election between the two main</v>
<v Speaker 1>candidates.</v>

1473
01:04:42.330 --> 01:04:47.330
<v Speaker 1>And what it looks like is that the far</v>
<v Speaker 1>right leader who is softer than her dad</v>

1474
01:04:47.851 --> 01:04:51.870
<v Speaker 1>who founded the far right party was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was like a Holocaust denier and</v>

1475
01:04:51.871 --> 01:04:54.220
<v Speaker 1>like serious antisemites and she's just</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

1476
01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:59.320
<v Speaker 1>an anti Muslim like anti-immigration</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nteu sort of like more right wing</v>

1477
01:05:00.151 --> 01:05:02.040
<v Speaker 1>version of trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1478
01:05:02.070 --> 01:05:04.320
<v Speaker 1>she will get through in next week's</v>
<v Speaker 1>election,</v>

1479
01:05:04.321 --> 01:05:05.760
<v Speaker 1>which means that she's going to wane</v>
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>

1480
01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:09.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the polls say she wasn't,</v>

1481
01:05:09.241 --> 01:05:11.730
<v Speaker 1>but the polls didn't say that brexit was</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to happen or that Donald Trump was</v>

1482
01:05:11.731 --> 01:05:13.470
<v Speaker 1>gonna win either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the question is,</v>

1483
01:05:13.471 --> 01:05:16.080
<v Speaker 1>will people stay at home?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the person who she's most likely</v>

1484
01:05:16.081 --> 01:05:18.070
<v Speaker 1>to be running against is just this kind</v>

1485
01:05:18.070 --> 01:05:20.110
<v Speaker 3>of slick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nice,</v>

1486
01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:22.300
<v Speaker 3>handsome,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't really believe in anything.</v>

1487
01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:25.300
<v Speaker 3>Not really a politician,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but kind of pragmatic.</v>

1488
01:05:25.301 --> 01:05:27.100
<v Speaker 3>I mean maybe that'll work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

1489
01:05:27.101 --> 01:05:31.520
<v Speaker 3>but it's a bit of a worry if you care</v>
<v Speaker 3>about the stability of Europe and like</v>

1490
01:05:31.870 --> 01:05:35.560
<v Speaker 3>Germany and France not ever being in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>war again for them not to be knitted</v>

1491
01:05:35.561 --> 01:05:38.710
<v Speaker 3>together and into the European Union.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do worry about it.</v>

1492
01:05:38.711 --> 01:05:40.540
<v Speaker 3>And then there was the Turkey thing that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were talking about,</v>

1493
01:05:40.541 --> 01:05:43.180
<v Speaker 3>so we've got these three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these kinds of pieces of jigsaw puzzle</v>

1494
01:05:43.181 --> 01:05:46.070
<v Speaker 3>that had been bashing around in my head</v>
<v Speaker 3>over the past few days about like,</v>

1495
01:05:46.780 --> 01:05:51.780
<v Speaker 3>will we look back on this period as just</v>
<v Speaker 3>a starting point to something even</v>

1496
01:05:52.871 --> 01:05:55.390
<v Speaker 3>bigger?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I already think that it's amazing</v>

1497
01:05:56.020 --> 01:05:58.960
<v Speaker 3>like that trump is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I mean if two years ago I was on,</v>

1498
01:05:58.990 --> 01:06:02.280
<v Speaker 3>when was I first on this show?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe three years ago or something like</v>

1499
01:06:02.290 --> 01:06:03.123
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1500
01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:05.980
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if someone had walked in that door and</v>

1501
01:06:05.981 --> 01:06:08.080
<v Speaker 3>said to us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1502
01:06:08.290 --> 01:06:11.530
<v Speaker 3>in 2017 you are going to be back on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>show,</v>

1503
01:06:11.531 --> 01:06:12.760
<v Speaker 3>are you going to be talking to each</v>
<v Speaker 3>other?</v>

1504
01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:18.300
<v Speaker 3>And the FBI will be conducting an active</v>
<v Speaker 3>investigation into whether or not the</v>

1505
01:06:20.111 --> 01:06:25.111
<v Speaker 3>government of the day conspired with</v>
<v Speaker 3>Putin in Russia to spread misinformation</v>

1506
01:06:28.001 --> 01:06:33.001
<v Speaker 3>and illegally hack the emails of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Democratic Party on,</v>

1507
01:06:33.101 --> 01:06:35.920
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the president is Donald Trump</v>

1508
01:06:37.470 --> 01:06:39.910
<v Speaker 3>and we know that the hacking happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know that the Russians hacked,</v>

1509
01:06:39.911 --> 01:06:41.890
<v Speaker 3>did hack this and did spread</v>
<v Speaker 3>misinformation.</v>

1510
01:06:41.891 --> 01:06:44.740
<v Speaker 3>But the only question is whether the FBI</v>
<v Speaker 3>is trying to figure out whether or not</v>

1511
01:06:44.741 --> 01:06:47.050
<v Speaker 3>there was active collaboration with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>government.</v>

1512
01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:50.620
<v Speaker 3>What do you think about that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we would be like,</v>

1513
01:06:50.710 --> 01:06:53.560
<v Speaker 3>that's a cartoon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a fucking cartoon story.</v>

1514
01:06:53.561 --> 01:06:58.561
<v Speaker 3>That is cray crazy cloud cuckoo land.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's where my head has been at.</v>

1515
01:06:59.250 --> 01:07:01.860
<v Speaker 5>But that would have been,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if we did have that conversation,</v>

1516
01:07:01.861 --> 01:07:05.010
<v Speaker 5>that would have been before the</v>
<v Speaker 5>nightclub shooting in Paris that have</v>

1517
01:07:05.011 --> 01:07:07.800
<v Speaker 5>been before the truck ran over those</v>
<v Speaker 5>people in Nice.</v>

1518
01:07:07.830 --> 01:07:08.940
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like the,</v>

1519
01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:14.000
<v Speaker 5>those are those terrorist attacks that</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have had over in France and in</v>

1520
01:07:14.041 --> 01:07:18.150
<v Speaker 5>Germany have scared the fucking shit out</v>
<v Speaker 5>of people and letting all those people</v>

1521
01:07:18.151 --> 01:07:22.710
<v Speaker 5>in from Syria with no vetting and</v>
<v Speaker 5>letting a lot of Muslims coming to the</v>

1522
01:07:22.711 --> 01:07:27.210
<v Speaker 5>country that may have some real hate in</v>
<v Speaker 5>their heart for this new land that</v>

1523
01:07:27.211 --> 01:07:30.040
<v Speaker 5>they've found.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean they've got some real issues and</v>

1524
01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:34.250
<v Speaker 5>that's when a person who's a fascist who</v>
<v Speaker 5>comes along who's like this anti</v>

1525
01:07:34.251 --> 01:07:35.820
<v Speaker 5>immigration,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1526
01:07:35.821 --> 01:07:38.730
<v Speaker 5>comes from a racist background,</v>
<v Speaker 5>super right wing.</v>

1527
01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:40.640
<v Speaker 5>That's when those people take hold.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well this is</v>

1528
01:07:40.670 --> 01:07:41.870
<v Speaker 3>what I always say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm actually,</v>

1529
01:07:41.871 --> 01:07:45.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking to Sam Harris tomorrow on my</v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast and this is something that he</v>

1530
01:07:45.771 --> 01:07:49.850
<v Speaker 3>and I talk about a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is we have to find a new way to</v>

1531
01:07:49.851 --> 01:07:53.780
<v Speaker 3>converse about the problem of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of Islamic jihadism without being so</v>

1532
01:07:53.781 --> 01:07:54.950
<v Speaker 3>full of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we,</v>

1533
01:07:54.951 --> 01:07:56.750
<v Speaker 3>if you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you are a globalist and an</v>

1534
01:07:56.751 --> 01:07:59.020
<v Speaker 3>international list like I am,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you basically believe</v>

1535
01:07:59.250 --> 01:08:01.020
<v Speaker 5>you're a globalist,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a negative thing.</v>

1536
01:08:01.170 --> 01:08:05.100
<v Speaker 5>I know I've only started using that term</v>
<v Speaker 5>lately because the old Wright thinks</v>

1537
01:08:05.101 --> 01:08:07.250
<v Speaker 5>that globalism is like this Jewish,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1538
01:08:07.390 --> 01:08:10.080
<v Speaker 5>global conspiracy and I love,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm trying to take over the world.</v>

1539
01:08:10.110 --> 01:08:12.930
<v Speaker 5>I'm open.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm an open minded person so I think</v>

1540
01:08:13.110 --> 01:08:16.640
<v Speaker 5>what I would define it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well I would it as being someone who</v>

1541
01:08:16.641 --> 01:08:20.960
<v Speaker 5>doesn't like borders and who doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 5>like nationalism and jingoism and</v>

1542
01:08:20.990 --> 01:08:23.930
<v Speaker 5>believes that we are all one and should</v>
<v Speaker 5>try to get along.</v>

1543
01:08:23.990 --> 01:08:25.940
<v Speaker 5>You don't want to hear Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I hear new world order.</v>

1544
01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:28.310
<v Speaker 5>That's what I hear.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This motherfucker's new world order.</v>

1545
01:08:28.370 --> 01:08:29.740
<v Speaker 5>I can't hear you if we got him on the</v>
<v Speaker 5>show.</v>

1546
01:08:31.250 --> 01:08:33.020
<v Speaker 5>Is that what that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>was that an Alex Jones impression?</v>

1547
01:08:33.090 --> 01:08:34.010
<v Speaker 5>It was getting close,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wasn't it?</v>

1548
01:08:34.190 --> 01:08:36.730
<v Speaker 5>Alex Jones is a performance artist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that what you're claiming?</v>

1549
01:08:36.740 --> 01:08:40.010
<v Speaker 5>You know what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I ask people on twitter what I should</v>

1550
01:08:40.011 --> 01:08:45.011
<v Speaker 5>ask you and overwhelmingly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>overwhelmingly it's all like why does he</v>

1551
01:08:45.051 --> 01:08:49.220
<v Speaker 5>legitimize quacks like Alex Jones</v>
<v Speaker 5>creates a false equivalents problem.</v>

1552
01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:49.821
<v Speaker 5>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1553
01:08:49.821 --> 01:08:50.091
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1554
01:08:50.091 --> 01:08:52.250
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why did he interview so many bad act</v>

1555
01:08:52.251 --> 01:08:54.620
<v Speaker 5>actors like Alex Jones?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How many people do I interview?</v>

1556
01:08:54.621 --> 01:08:56.930
<v Speaker 5>Like Alex Jones?</v>
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>

1557
01:08:57.170 --> 01:08:59.540
<v Speaker 5>I don't interview anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not interviewing you,</v>

1558
01:08:59.541 --> 01:09:00.320
<v Speaker 5>am I?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nope.</v>

1559
01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:01.490
<v Speaker 5>I'm not an interviewer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1560
01:09:01.940 --> 01:09:05.300
<v Speaker 5>I suck at that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've kind of interviewed Ron miscavige</v>

1561
01:09:05.330 --> 01:09:08.310
<v Speaker 5>yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I talked to people and I record it.</v>

1562
01:09:08.470 --> 01:09:10.700
<v Speaker 5>It's it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not a journalist by any stretch of</v>

1563
01:09:10.701 --> 01:09:13.010
<v Speaker 5>the imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Alice Joe has been my friend for 20</v>

1564
01:09:13.011 --> 01:09:15.620
<v Speaker 5>years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's fucking crazy.</v>

1565
01:09:15.770 --> 01:09:19.370
<v Speaker 5>I showed everybody how crazy he wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 5>my podcast by getting them high and</v>

1566
01:09:19.371 --> 01:09:22.370
<v Speaker 5>drunk and have them talk about inner</v>
<v Speaker 5>dimensional child molesters.</v>

1567
01:09:22.670 --> 01:09:27.110
<v Speaker 5>If you watch that and you think I'm</v>
<v Speaker 5>legitimising Alex Jones and some sort of</v>

1568
01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:28.220
<v Speaker 5>way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then you're just,</v>

1569
01:09:28.290 --> 01:09:29.210
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're just,</v>

1570
01:09:29.750 --> 01:09:31.610
<v Speaker 5>you're looking at things in a very</v>
<v Speaker 5>cookie cutter,</v>

1571
01:09:31.611 --> 01:09:33.800
<v Speaker 5>wet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're deciding that this is what I've</v>

1572
01:09:33.801 --> 01:09:35.660
<v Speaker 5>done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But a lot of people listen to you.</v>

1573
01:09:35.660 --> 01:09:38.240
<v Speaker 5>And so I think the criticism that these</v>
<v Speaker 5>people have is like,</v>

1574
01:09:38.330 --> 01:09:42.320
<v Speaker 5>people put faith in you and they assume</v>
<v Speaker 5>that if you don't raise a question</v>

1575
01:09:42.321 --> 01:09:43.800
<v Speaker 5>against something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that that means that,</v>

1576
01:09:43.970 --> 01:09:47.060
<v Speaker 5>that you tacitly agree with what's being</v>
<v Speaker 5>said and that that'll,</v>

1577
01:09:47.061 --> 01:09:50.450
<v Speaker 5>that allows the physicians about Alex.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of,</v>

1578
01:09:50.451 --> 01:09:51.460
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't listen to the Europe.</v>

1579
01:09:51.660 --> 01:09:54.320
<v Speaker 5>We raise questions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we were more bullshitting than</v>

1580
01:09:54.321 --> 01:09:56.660
<v Speaker 5>anything and having fun and he was</v>
<v Speaker 5>hammered.</v>

1581
01:09:57.020 --> 01:09:57.590
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

1582
01:09:57.590 --> 01:10:00.890
<v Speaker 5>people got a chance to see them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're actually using footage of the</v>

1583
01:10:00.891 --> 01:10:04.840
<v Speaker 5>conversation that we had against him and</v>
<v Speaker 5>his custody battle because they're</v>

1584
01:10:04.850 --> 01:10:07.880
<v Speaker 5>saying he was in Los Angeles on film</v>
<v Speaker 5>smoking marijuana.</v>

1585
01:10:08.510 --> 01:10:12.640
<v Speaker 5>He's a loose cannon and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's literally being used against</v>

1586
01:10:12.641 --> 01:10:14.630
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't give a fuck.</v>

1587
01:10:14.631 --> 01:10:15.464
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They asked.</v>

1588
01:10:16.370 --> 01:10:17.900
<v Speaker 5>They asked him a question about his kid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He couldn't remember.</v>

1589
01:10:17.901 --> 01:10:18.500
<v Speaker 5>It was op.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sorry.</v>

1590
01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:20.030
<v Speaker 5>I had a large bowl of Chili for lunch</v>
<v Speaker 5>today.</v>

1591
01:10:20.030 --> 01:10:22.370
<v Speaker 5>I can't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's fucking crazy.</v>

1592
01:10:22.850 --> 01:10:26.670
<v Speaker 5>He's crazy and he makes ridiculous</v>
<v Speaker 5>amounts of money out stones.</v>

1593
01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:29.480
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's a great guy.</v>

1594
01:10:29.481 --> 01:10:30.770
<v Speaker 5>I swear to God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's a great guy.</v>

1595
01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:34.340
<v Speaker 5>He's just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's just got a ridiculous platform and</v>

1596
01:10:34.341 --> 01:10:36.890
<v Speaker 5>he's kind of character,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he's he,</v>

1597
01:10:36.891 --> 01:10:38.060
<v Speaker 5>that's who he is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1598
01:10:38.150 --> 01:10:42.020
<v Speaker 5>You think he's a performance artist?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think there is a part of what he does</v>

1599
01:10:42.021 --> 01:10:47.021
<v Speaker 5>that is most certainly theater.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think anybody who doesn't see that</v>

1600
01:10:47.190 --> 01:10:49.400
<v Speaker 5>goes out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Todd comes in and todd comes out.</v>

1601
01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:50.990
<v Speaker 5>That's bad impression.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got to work on it.</v>

1602
01:10:51.180 --> 01:10:52.690
<v Speaker 5>It's almost as bad as my trump</v>
<v Speaker 5>impression.</v>

1603
01:10:52.730 --> 01:10:54.490
<v Speaker 5>Fortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I never listened to Ellis Jones,</v>

1604
01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:57.800
<v Speaker 5>so I don't actually know what he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I see clips of him when someone</v>

1605
01:10:57.801 --> 01:11:01.190
<v Speaker 5>shares something with me online,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but like life's too short to listen to</v>

1606
01:11:01.191 --> 01:11:03.950
<v Speaker 5>Alec's giant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just best clips or when he gets mad and</v>

1607
01:11:03.951 --> 01:11:05.660
<v Speaker 5>then he apologizes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm a Christian.</v>

1608
01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:09.260
<v Speaker 5>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He comes to someone.</v>

1609
01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:13.200
<v Speaker 5>Someone said something about him</v>
<v Speaker 5>recently and he went all,</v>

1610
01:11:13.201 --> 01:11:14.060
<v Speaker 5>I never swear.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I never</v>

1611
01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:16.200
<v Speaker 4>swearing at 20 years of nurse Warren on</v>
<v Speaker 4>the air,</v>

1612
01:11:16.201 --> 01:11:20.400
<v Speaker 4>but this fucking fat like</v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy.</v>

1613
01:11:21.060 --> 01:11:23.290
<v Speaker 4>Fucking crazy on this one guy and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

1614
01:11:23.310 --> 01:11:24.240
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry.</v>

1615
01:11:24.241 --> 01:11:25.830
<v Speaker 4>I apologize.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm children listening.</v>

1616
01:11:25.970 --> 01:11:28.560
<v Speaker 4>This is wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's fucking,</v>

1617
01:11:28.561 --> 01:11:30.780
<v Speaker 4>he's a maniac.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not giving him,</v>

1618
01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:35.190
<v Speaker 4>I'm not giving him legitimacy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He already has a massive platform,</v>

1619
01:11:35.220 --> 01:11:39.570
<v Speaker 4>arguably bigger than mine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What I'm doing is showing you what I see</v>

1620
01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:41.700
<v Speaker 4>when I hang out with Alex Jones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People are like,</v>

1621
01:11:41.701 --> 01:11:42.960
<v Speaker 4>why are you friends with Alex Jones?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1622
01:11:42.961 --> 01:11:44.820
<v Speaker 4>he's a nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like him.</v>

1623
01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:47.850
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a friend do I argued with for a</v>

1624
01:11:47.850 --> 01:11:49.770
<v Speaker 4>fucking hour yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thinks I'm pretty sure he thinks the</v>

1625
01:11:49.771 --> 01:11:50.970
<v Speaker 4>fucking world is flat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1626
01:11:50.971 --> 01:11:53.460
<v Speaker 4>That's another one that I got satellites</v>
<v Speaker 4>is Eddie Bravo.</v>

1627
01:11:53.510 --> 01:11:55.170
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He thinks satellites aren't real.</v>

1628
01:11:55.260 --> 01:11:57.810
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't believe in dinosaurs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He thinks dinosaurs are bull bullshit.</v>

1629
01:11:57.811 --> 01:11:59.130
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't believe in nuclear bombs.</v>

1630
01:11:59.340 --> 01:12:02.740
<v Speaker 4>He's out to lunch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't believe in nuclear bombs.</v>

1631
01:12:02.950 --> 01:12:03.481
<v Speaker 4>It,</v>
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>

1632
01:12:03.481 --> 01:12:04.314
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't,</v>

1633
01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:06.810
<v Speaker 4>you can't even hold it to the fire.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1634
01:12:07.170 --> 01:12:09.870
<v Speaker 4>it's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't understand his thought process,</v>

1635
01:12:09.871 --> 01:12:11.640
<v Speaker 4>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been friends with him.</v>

1636
01:12:11.670 --> 01:12:13.200
<v Speaker 4>As long as I've been friends with Alex</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jones,</v>

1637
01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:15.180
<v Speaker 4>I'm awake closer with Eddie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>way closer.</v>

1638
01:12:15.181 --> 01:12:16.350
<v Speaker 4>Like Ed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's one of my best friends.</v>

1639
01:12:16.710 --> 01:12:19.410
<v Speaker 4>He's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you talked to him about</v>

1640
01:12:19.411 --> 01:12:22.440
<v Speaker 4>conspiracies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you talk to them about like mma</v>

1641
01:12:22.441 --> 01:12:24.120
<v Speaker 4>or he's a jujitsu genius,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1642
01:12:24.121 --> 01:12:27.990
<v Speaker 4>he's like one of the very best Jujitsu</v>
<v Speaker 4>instructors on the planet earth.</v>

1643
01:12:27.991 --> 01:12:28.770
<v Speaker 4>Without a doubt.</v>

1644
01:12:28.770 --> 01:12:29.541
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

1645
01:12:29.541 --> 01:12:32.810
<v Speaker 3>comes back again to the like how we can</v>
<v Speaker 3>compartmentalize our minds,</v>

1646
01:12:32.811 --> 01:12:34.250
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a religious person who</v>

1647
01:12:34.251 --> 01:12:37.170
<v Speaker 3>believes in the story of Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's also otherwise super</v>

1648
01:12:37.171 --> 01:12:37.560
<v Speaker 3>intelligent.</v>

1649
01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:39.060
<v Speaker 4>That's a perfect analogy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1650
01:12:39.190 --> 01:12:39.740
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1651
01:12:39.740 --> 01:12:41.400
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

1652
01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:44.850
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how people's brains work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't understand.</v>

1653
01:12:45.530 --> 01:12:46.351
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1654
01:12:46.351 --> 01:12:48.120
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>

1655
01:12:48.121 --> 01:12:53.121
<v Speaker 4>I've tried to study like people's really</v>
<v Speaker 4>irrational thinking and tried it,</v>

1656
01:12:54.180 --> 01:12:56.350
<v Speaker 4>but you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I worry more than anything that worried</v>

1657
01:12:56.351 --> 01:12:58.140
<v Speaker 4>that it's contagious disease.</v>

1658
01:12:58.450 --> 01:13:00.700
<v Speaker 3>I think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it is,</v>

1659
01:13:00.940 --> 01:13:04.450
<v Speaker 3>and this is why I'm a bit worried about</v>
<v Speaker 3>way we're at culturally at the moment</v>

1660
01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:09.960
<v Speaker 3>because I think that concern about</v>
<v Speaker 3>irrationalism being contagious is not</v>

1661
01:13:10.001 --> 01:13:14.950
<v Speaker 3>too dissimilar from my concern about a</v>
<v Speaker 3>disrespect for the idea of truth and</v>

1662
01:13:14.951 --> 01:13:19.030
<v Speaker 3>falsehood being contagious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know it when I was talking about</v>

1663
01:13:19.060 --> 01:13:20.590
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the this analyst,</v>

1664
01:13:20.591 --> 01:13:25.591
<v Speaker 3>this Russian journalist who was talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about the ways in which Putin and Chavez</v>

1665
01:13:25.990 --> 01:13:29.140
<v Speaker 3>and Atawan in Turkey and the Hungarian</v>
<v Speaker 3>dictator,</v>

1666
01:13:29.860 --> 01:13:33.250
<v Speaker 3>what not dictated Hungarian president</v>
<v Speaker 3>who was becoming a quad.</v>

1667
01:13:33.251 --> 01:13:37.780
<v Speaker 3>I dictated the way that they kind of use</v>
<v Speaker 3>the muddiness of the whole question of</v>

1668
01:13:37.781 --> 01:13:42.781
<v Speaker 3>what's true or false as a way of</v>
<v Speaker 3>throwing sand in the gears of the whole</v>

1669
01:13:43.241 --> 01:13:47.110
<v Speaker 3>democratic process and sand in the gears</v>
<v Speaker 3>of people's ability to kind of analyze</v>

1670
01:13:47.111 --> 01:13:50.170
<v Speaker 3>the world and figure out what's true and</v>
<v Speaker 3>false and what's important and not</v>

1671
01:13:50.171 --> 01:13:55.171
<v Speaker 3>important that if all you're doing every</v>
<v Speaker 3>day is just tweeting out like a stream</v>

1672
01:13:55.211 --> 01:13:58.510
<v Speaker 3>of nonsensical bullshit that is neither</v>
<v Speaker 3>true nor false but kind of exists in</v>

1673
01:13:58.511 --> 01:14:02.440
<v Speaker 3>like this area of like you are trump's</v>
<v Speaker 3>ego.</v>

1674
01:14:03.430 --> 01:14:08.350
<v Speaker 3>Then I actually have found myself</v>
<v Speaker 3>becoming less convinced about reliable</v>

1675
01:14:08.351 --> 01:14:12.670
<v Speaker 3>sources of information and myself</v>
<v Speaker 3>becoming more to irrational</v>

1676
01:14:12.820 --> 01:14:16.270
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't feel as confident anymore.</v>

1677
01:14:16.870 --> 01:14:20.710
<v Speaker 1>Like it's easy because there's so much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see so much stuff of like I'll tweet</v>

1678
01:14:20.711 --> 01:14:24.220
<v Speaker 1>out something that the Washington Post</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the Wall Street Journal or The New</v>

1679
01:14:24.220 --> 01:14:25.670
<v Speaker 1>York Times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1680
01:14:25.870 --> 01:14:28.660
<v Speaker 1>have published,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of which I regard as being</v>

1681
01:14:28.900 --> 01:14:32.980
<v Speaker 1>upstanding publications where I have</v>
<v Speaker 1>faith that the journalists are doing</v>

1682
01:14:32.981 --> 01:14:34.510
<v Speaker 1>their best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not always perfectly,</v>

1683
01:14:34.570 --> 01:14:38.830
<v Speaker 1>but doing their best in the long haul to</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell the truth and only report facts and</v>

1684
01:14:38.831 --> 01:14:39.990
<v Speaker 1>then people will say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1685
01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:40.930
<v Speaker 1>fake news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fake news.</v>

1686
01:14:40.931 --> 01:14:42.940
<v Speaker 1>That is the bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they'll link to something to Alex</v>

1687
01:14:42.940 --> 01:14:45.610
<v Speaker 1>Jones said is if there's kind of a kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of equivalence between those two things.</v>

1688
01:14:45.910 --> 01:14:49.960
<v Speaker 1>And I have to remind myself to an actual</v>
<v Speaker 1>specific thing.</v>

1689
01:14:49.961 --> 01:14:52.090
<v Speaker 1>You're just speaking in generality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People have linked,</v>

1690
01:14:52.091 --> 01:14:56.110
<v Speaker 1>people have told me that they believe</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no difference between the</v>

1691
01:14:56.111 --> 01:14:58.900
<v Speaker 1>credibility of Alex Jones and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>credibility of the New York Times,</v>

1692
01:15:05.410 --> 01:15:07.720
<v Speaker 1>New York Times talking about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>interdimensional child molesters.</v>

1693
01:15:08.230 --> 01:15:09.550
<v Speaker 1>Not yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's give him time.</v>

1694
01:15:09.551 --> 01:15:10.670
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

1695
01:15:10.671 --> 01:15:14.050
<v Speaker 1>its early days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was administration times has fucked</v>

1696
01:15:14.051 --> 01:15:15.210
<v Speaker 1>up in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1697
01:15:15.250 --> 01:15:19.540
<v Speaker 1>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have strayed from unbiased</v>

1698
01:15:19.541 --> 01:15:22.150
<v Speaker 1>journalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is an issue because as soon as you</v>

1699
01:15:22.151 --> 01:15:25.000
<v Speaker 1>start doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as soon as you editorialize the news,</v>

1700
01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:29.410
<v Speaker 1>you open yourself up for people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>point out that you editorialize the news</v>

1701
01:15:29.411 --> 01:15:32.620
<v Speaker 1>and then point out the fact that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>biased and they have but hold on,</v>

1702
01:15:32.650 --> 01:15:36.190
<v Speaker 1>they have been not that that's an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think they realize that they,</v>

1703
01:15:36.370 --> 01:15:39.370
<v Speaker 1>that has been used against them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's one of the things</v>

1704
01:15:39.371 --> 01:15:44.371
<v Speaker 1>that they addressed when they talked</v>
<v Speaker 1>about sort of reinvigorating the idea of</v>

1705
01:15:45.821 --> 01:15:48.280
<v Speaker 1>objective journalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they started talking about that</v>

1706
01:15:48.281 --> 01:15:52.390
<v Speaker 1>after the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the trump election after he was elected</v>

1707
01:15:52.391 --> 01:15:55.690
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They talked about this a reinvigoration</v>

1708
01:15:55.691 --> 01:15:58.900
<v Speaker 1>and this sort of re re committing</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves to,</v>

1709
01:15:58.940 --> 01:16:00.190
<v Speaker 1>to real hard journalists.</v>

1710
01:16:00.250 --> 01:16:02.230
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people also had done</v>

1711
01:16:02.231 --> 01:16:05.050
<v Speaker 1>understand the difference between the</v>
<v Speaker 1>editorial page and like the opinion</v>

1712
01:16:05.051 --> 01:16:09.790
<v Speaker 1>pages and the news section is true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even the new section has been</v>

1713
01:16:09.791 --> 01:16:10.900
<v Speaker 1>biased.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1714
01:16:10.980 --> 01:16:13.090
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there have been storms in a couple of</v>

1715
01:16:13.091 --> 01:16:16.450
<v Speaker 1>occasions been things we have a blind I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think yeah they have.</v>

1716
01:16:16.451 --> 01:16:19.090
<v Speaker 1>But as soon as you just leave open that</v>
<v Speaker 1>potential,</v>

1717
01:16:19.091 --> 01:16:20.380
<v Speaker 1>that possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then people go,</v>

1718
01:16:20.410 --> 01:16:21.550
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a bunch of left wingers.</v>

1719
01:16:21.551 --> 01:16:24.110
<v Speaker 1>Like a lot of people think that because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got the election wrong,</v>

1720
01:16:24.140 --> 01:16:27.320
<v Speaker 1>that means that you can't trust Paul's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's another way in which in which they,</v>

1721
01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:30.730
<v Speaker 1>this kind of insidious idea that nothing</v>
<v Speaker 1>is trustworthy and there's no such thing</v>

1722
01:16:30.731 --> 01:16:34.360
<v Speaker 1>as the truth or facts or you'll version</v>
<v Speaker 1>of history is as good as anyone's</v>

1723
01:16:34.361 --> 01:16:36.100
<v Speaker 1>version of history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is another thing that Lawrence</v>

1724
01:16:36.100 --> 01:16:37.540
<v Speaker 1>Krauss was saying on my podcast by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

1725
01:16:37.870 --> 01:16:42.730
<v Speaker 1>which is he thinks that there's a link</v>
<v Speaker 1>between the kind of postmodern like</v>

1726
01:16:42.731 --> 01:16:46.420
<v Speaker 1>hippie 1960s like philosopher movement</v>
<v Speaker 1>of like,</v>

1727
01:16:46.421 --> 01:16:48.190
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe whatever you want to man.</v>

1728
01:16:48.191 --> 01:16:49.630
<v Speaker 1>Like there is no truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1729
01:16:49.631 --> 01:16:53.410
<v Speaker 1>Like truth is all salt socially</v>
<v Speaker 1>constructed and like gender is entirely</v>

1730
01:16:53.411 --> 01:16:56.020
<v Speaker 1>socially constructed and there was no</v>
<v Speaker 1>such thing as masculinity.</v>

1731
01:16:56.170 --> 01:16:57.190
<v Speaker 1>It's all just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1732
01:16:57.191 --> 01:17:00.070
<v Speaker 1>some kind of capitalist story that we've</v>
<v Speaker 1>all been led to believe.</v>

1733
01:17:00.071 --> 01:17:03.730
<v Speaker 1>So I like put a flower in your hair and</v>
<v Speaker 1>bust out of it and let your truth be</v>

1734
01:17:03.731 --> 01:17:07.660
<v Speaker 1>whatever that you want the truth to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He stays a link between that and what</v>

1735
01:17:07.661 --> 01:17:09.710
<v Speaker 1>you might think of as being something</v>
<v Speaker 1>opposite,</v>

1736
01:17:09.711 --> 01:17:10.400
<v Speaker 1>which is</v>

1737
01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:15.400
<v Speaker 5>the hard right kind of outright trumpy</v>
<v Speaker 5>sort of fake news phenomenon because</v>

1738
01:17:17.271 --> 01:17:22.271
<v Speaker 5>both of them make the claim that there's</v>
<v Speaker 5>no such thing as the truth essentially.</v>

1739
01:17:22.550 --> 01:17:24.680
<v Speaker 5>And your truth is whatever is true for</v>
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>

1740
01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:26.810
<v Speaker 5>There were a million people and a dog.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't alteration.</v>

1741
01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:30.200
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The warships were steaming towards North</v>

1742
01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:31.250
<v Speaker 5>Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1743
01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:33.120
<v Speaker 5>Trump said it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Does it matter?</v>

1744
01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:34.490
<v Speaker 5>Terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is true or not true.</v>

1745
01:17:34.790 --> 01:17:37.730
<v Speaker 5>What's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's unpack that one step at a time.</v>

1746
01:17:38.030 --> 01:17:41.210
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I definitely think that some of the,</v>

1747
01:17:41.300 --> 01:17:45.020
<v Speaker 5>as we said before,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some of the reasons why trump became</v>

1748
01:17:45.021 --> 01:17:50.021
<v Speaker 5>popular are these ridiculous assertions</v>
<v Speaker 5>that gender has no basis in biology.</v>

1749
01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:57.560
<v Speaker 5>That you can be anything you want.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can be Fox.</v>

1750
01:17:57.561 --> 01:17:59.390
<v Speaker 5>Can you know that you can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1751
01:17:59.540 --> 01:18:01.520
<v Speaker 5>you can identify with being,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's,</v>

1752
01:18:01.521 --> 01:18:04.790
<v Speaker 5>there's people that are trying to figure</v>
<v Speaker 5>out whether or not trans racial is a</v>

1753
01:18:04.791 --> 01:18:05.450
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>

1754
01:18:05.450 --> 01:18:10.450
<v Speaker 5>Rachel Dolezal was on CNN and she was</v>
<v Speaker 5>talking about the fact that race is a</v>

1755
01:18:11.391 --> 01:18:13.250
<v Speaker 5>social construct is interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wasn't it?</v>

1756
01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:16.250
<v Speaker 5>It is interesting because people don't</v>
<v Speaker 5>want to accept that black people get</v>

1757
01:18:16.251 --> 01:18:18.050
<v Speaker 5>really mad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're getting really mad at her.</v>

1758
01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:23.120
<v Speaker 5>They also say the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I mean anytime worth their salt</v>

1759
01:18:23.150 --> 01:18:25.410
<v Speaker 5>understands that race is not a genetic</v>
<v Speaker 5>thing,</v>

1760
01:18:25.411 --> 01:18:29.930
<v Speaker 5>that this is a cultural construct.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I mean I find it,</v>

1761
01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:34.960
<v Speaker 5>I find her logic sort of hard to flow in</v>
<v Speaker 5>to fault in a way is most sort of social</v>

1762
01:18:35.391 --> 01:18:38.030
<v Speaker 5>construct.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's most certainly more solid than</v>

1763
01:18:38.031 --> 01:18:40.730
<v Speaker 5>saying there's no biological basis for</v>
<v Speaker 5>gender.</v>

1764
01:18:40.820 --> 01:18:43.340
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's more biological basis to six</v>

1765
01:18:43.341 --> 01:18:44.450
<v Speaker 5>than there is to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1766
01:18:44.451 --> 01:18:49.280
<v Speaker 5>there's more sex chromosomal issue.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's an x,</v>

1767
01:18:49.281 --> 01:18:54.230
<v Speaker 5>y chromosome that males have and if a</v>
<v Speaker 5>male decides that he identifies with</v>

1768
01:18:54.231 --> 01:18:55.490
<v Speaker 5>being a female,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

1769
01:18:55.491 --> 01:18:58.190
<v Speaker 5>there's a boy that's running track now</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a new one,</v>

1770
01:18:58.191 --> 01:19:01.550
<v Speaker 5>cause they've had a few of these is the</v>
<v Speaker 5>one who was a girl that was a wrestler</v>

1771
01:19:01.551 --> 01:19:03.020
<v Speaker 5>that was taking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she wanted to be a boy.</v>

1772
01:19:03.170 --> 01:19:05.750
<v Speaker 5>So she was taking testosterone and</v>
<v Speaker 5>crushing all these other girls in</v>

1773
01:19:05.751 --> 01:19:07.550
<v Speaker 5>wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She won the state title in Texas,</v>

1774
01:19:07.551 --> 01:19:09.880
<v Speaker 5>I think you mean he was a trans,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever,</v>

1775
01:19:09.890 --> 01:19:12.320
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But now there's a boy who's not even</v>

1776
01:19:12.321 --> 01:19:16.310
<v Speaker 5>taking treatment who decides he</v>
<v Speaker 5>identifies as a girl and he's just</v>

1777
01:19:16.370 --> 01:19:19.250
<v Speaker 5>whooping everybody's ass and track cause</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's a fucking boy.</v>

1778
01:19:19.660 --> 01:19:21.250
<v Speaker 5>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's a girl but he's not a boy.</v>

1779
01:19:21.350 --> 01:19:24.350
<v Speaker 5>He's not a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We have to find a way to like separate</v>

1780
01:19:24.351 --> 01:19:26.660
<v Speaker 5>the psychologic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the psychology from the physiology,</v>

1781
01:19:27.580 --> 01:19:28.850
<v Speaker 5>especially in sports.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

1782
01:19:28.851 --> 01:19:30.890
<v Speaker 5>100%,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially in combat sports.</v>

1783
01:19:31.240 --> 01:19:33.140
<v Speaker 5>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I took a lot of heat because I was</v>

1784
01:19:33.141 --> 01:19:35.690
<v Speaker 5>saying that there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was a man who was a man for 30</v>

1785
01:19:35.691 --> 01:19:38.180
<v Speaker 5>years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It became a woman and didn't tell people</v>

1786
01:19:38.300 --> 01:19:41.220
<v Speaker 5>that he used to be a man for 30 years</v>
<v Speaker 5>and beat the fuck out of two checks</v>

1787
01:19:41.870 --> 01:19:43.520
<v Speaker 5>before eventually came out.</v>

1788
01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:44.930
<v Speaker 5>And now when,</v>
<v Speaker 5>once your out look,</v>

1789
01:19:44.931 --> 01:19:48.020
<v Speaker 5>I say especially in professional sports,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1790
01:19:48.140 --> 01:19:49.760
<v Speaker 5>you have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have,</v>

1791
01:19:49.761 --> 01:19:50.361
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1792
01:19:50.361 --> 01:19:54.530
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like two to say no or to say yes to</v>

1793
01:19:54.531 --> 01:19:57.440
<v Speaker 5>compete against that person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think if a woman wants to fight</v>

1794
01:19:57.441 --> 01:19:59.900
<v Speaker 5>against a man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if a woman's 130 pounds and she wants to</v>

1795
01:19:59.901 --> 01:20:02.150
<v Speaker 5>fight against a man as 130 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they both agree.</v>

1796
01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:04.430
<v Speaker 5>Do whatever you want.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think you should be allowed to.</v>

1797
01:20:04.700 --> 01:20:08.340
<v Speaker 5>But I think that there's a big</v>
<v Speaker 5>difference between who has been a man.</v>

1798
01:20:08.341 --> 01:20:11.700
<v Speaker 5>Their whole life has said testosterone</v>
<v Speaker 5>flowing through their bones,</v>

1799
01:20:11.790 --> 01:20:12.960
<v Speaker 5>their blood,</v>
<v Speaker 5>their body,</v>

1800
01:20:12.961 --> 01:20:15.990
<v Speaker 5>their whole life,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then decides they're a woman versus</v>

1801
01:20:15.991 --> 01:20:17.670
<v Speaker 5>a woman who was born,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a woman,</v>

1802
01:20:17.700 --> 01:20:20.970
<v Speaker 5>raised a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and as a biological woman her entire</v>

1803
01:20:20.971 --> 01:20:23.880
<v Speaker 5>life,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a transgender woman just is not a</v>

1804
01:20:23.881 --> 01:20:25.590
<v Speaker 5>regular biological woman.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's this,</v>

1805
01:20:25.591 --> 01:20:26.550
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a difference,</v>

1806
01:20:26.730 --> 01:20:31.620
<v Speaker 5>but saying that gets people so angry</v>
<v Speaker 5>saying that a transgender woman who you</v>

1807
01:20:31.621 --> 01:20:33.270
<v Speaker 5>can say as a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I say that,</v>

1808
01:20:33.271 --> 01:20:36.720
<v Speaker 5>but saying that they're the same thing</v>
<v Speaker 5>as a biological woman is just not</v>

1809
01:20:36.721 --> 01:20:38.910
<v Speaker 5>factually true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well was a different,</v>

1810
01:20:38.911 --> 01:20:41.250
<v Speaker 5>they have different chromosomes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have a different structure.</v>

1811
01:20:41.251 --> 01:20:44.130
<v Speaker 5>The hips are built different,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the shoulders are wider,</v>

1812
01:20:44.131 --> 01:20:46.530
<v Speaker 5>the hands are big.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's so many factors.</v>

1813
01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:48.820
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what makes people so frustrated</v>

1814
01:20:48.821 --> 01:20:51.240
<v Speaker 3>about the whole political correctness</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>

1815
01:20:51.241 --> 01:20:54.190
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That we set up trip wires and if you</v>

1816
01:20:54.191 --> 01:20:56.590
<v Speaker 3>trigger one of those tripwires by making</v>
<v Speaker 3>a claim,</v>

1817
01:20:56.591 --> 01:20:59.320
<v Speaker 3>like the one you just made,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is that a trans woman is not</v>

1818
01:20:59.350 --> 01:21:02.560
<v Speaker 3>exactly the same as a cis woman and non</v>
<v Speaker 3>trans.</v>

1819
01:21:02.650 --> 01:21:03.220
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Not going to do it.</v>

1821
01:21:05.470 --> 01:21:06.640
<v Speaker 5>Not Real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do you wanna call them?</v>

1822
01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:10.990
<v Speaker 5>Disease.</v>

1823
01:21:10.990 --> 01:21:14.290
<v Speaker 5>Z.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Z is the z instead of she for a trends.</v>

1824
01:21:14.470 --> 01:21:14.951
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not.</v>

1825
01:21:14.951 --> 01:21:17.410
<v Speaker 5>Instead of she needs a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sorry,</v>

1826
01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:18.850
<v Speaker 5>did I just triggered one on the</v>
<v Speaker 5>tripwires.</v>

1827
01:21:18.851 --> 01:21:20.840
<v Speaker 5>Did I?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's non-gender base.</v>

1828
01:21:21.820 --> 01:21:26.820
<v Speaker 5>It is a non gender base.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's he or she for people who don't have</v>

1829
01:21:27.011 --> 01:21:29.020
<v Speaker 5>agenda,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's what the fuck it is.</v>

1830
01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:32.130
<v Speaker 5>And you sitting over there as,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as as a male.</v>

1831
01:21:32.490 --> 01:21:34.690
<v Speaker 5>It was an actual mail.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm a CIS male.</v>

1832
01:21:34.790 --> 01:21:36.520
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1833
01:21:36.700 --> 01:21:40.690
<v Speaker 5>Not an actual male biological male.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All men have penises.</v>

1834
01:21:41.170 --> 01:21:43.030
<v Speaker 5>I had buck angel on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

1835
01:21:43.090 --> 01:21:48.090
<v Speaker 5>Who's a Trans Jans Jan who uses the term</v>
<v Speaker 5>biological male.</v>

1836
01:21:48.340 --> 01:21:50.620
<v Speaker 5>He says there's a difference between</v>
<v Speaker 5>biological man.</v>

1837
01:21:50.621 --> 01:21:54.490
<v Speaker 5>He was born a woman and then</v>
<v Speaker 5>transitioned to being a man and he says,</v>

1838
01:21:54.491 --> 01:21:58.210
<v Speaker 5>biological male,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he says that Trans people hate on</v>

1839
01:21:58.211 --> 01:22:01.880
<v Speaker 5>him for using the term biological.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1840
01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:05.410
<v Speaker 5>what does he mean by the term?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was someone who has x,</v>

1841
01:22:05.411 --> 01:22:08.680
<v Speaker 5>y chromosome,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a biological male versus him who has x,</v>

1842
01:22:08.681 --> 01:22:09.110
<v Speaker 5>x,</v>
<v Speaker 5>y,</v>

1843
01:22:09.110 --> 01:22:09.943
<v Speaker 5>Z.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I see.</v>

1844
01:22:10.660 --> 01:22:12.980
<v Speaker 5>I thought you meant that he calls</v>
<v Speaker 5>himself a biological male.</v>

1845
01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:14.710
<v Speaker 5>People biology.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1846
01:22:14.711 --> 01:22:15.431
<v Speaker 5>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

1847
01:22:15.431 --> 01:22:17.110
<v Speaker 5>you should,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you should be able to differentiate</v>

1848
01:22:17.111 --> 01:22:20.380
<v Speaker 5>without being prejudiced.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so,</v>

1849
01:22:20.500 --> 01:22:22.570
<v Speaker 5>I mean ha,</v>

1850
01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:26.810
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Crazy town.</v>

1851
01:22:27.090 --> 01:22:29.940
<v Speaker 3>I just think that people should be able</v>
<v Speaker 3>to live however they want to live their</v>

1852
01:22:29.941 --> 01:22:30.960
<v Speaker 3>lives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I don't,</v>

1853
01:22:30.980 --> 01:22:33.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't spend a lot of time thinking</v>

1854
01:22:33.661 --> 01:22:35.670
<v Speaker 3>about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I just wished that we were all</v>

1855
01:22:35.671 --> 01:22:39.510
<v Speaker 3>generous enough that when people find it</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little bit difficult to understand,</v>

1856
01:22:39.511 --> 01:22:43.170
<v Speaker 3>you don't assume that they're bigoted</v>
<v Speaker 3>just because it's a new concept for</v>

1857
01:22:43.171 --> 01:22:44.004
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because,</v>

1858
01:22:44.260 --> 01:22:47.550
<v Speaker 3>and I think as you say it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is part of what gave rise to trump.</v>

1859
01:22:47.570 --> 01:22:49.650
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the,</v>

1860
01:22:49.860 --> 01:22:53.130
<v Speaker 3>the parallel that I was drawing a moment</v>
<v Speaker 3>ago between like post structuralist,</v>

1861
01:22:53.131 --> 01:22:58.131
<v Speaker 3>there is no such thing as gender and</v>
<v Speaker 3>trump's fake news campaign was not so</v>

1862
01:22:58.231 --> 01:23:01.680
<v Speaker 3>much that all the one led to the other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just that both,</v>

1863
01:23:01.710 --> 01:23:05.680
<v Speaker 3>this is the point that Lawrence Krauss</v>
<v Speaker 3>was making both undermine the,</v>

1864
01:23:05.710 --> 01:23:07.690
<v Speaker 3>they both erode the idea of truth</v>

1865
01:23:08.230 --> 01:23:12.460
<v Speaker 4>and what's ironic is it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's almost exactly the same thing that</v>

1866
01:23:12.461 --> 01:23:15.490
<v Speaker 4>bill o'reilly said.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The tie goes in the time it comes out.</v>

1867
01:23:15.640 --> 01:23:18.310
<v Speaker 4>People push this way and then people go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck you.</v>

1868
01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:21.820
<v Speaker 4>There is a biological difference and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then they pushed that way and then they</v>

1869
01:23:21.821 --> 01:23:23.050
<v Speaker 4>get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they get transphobic.</v>

1870
01:23:23.170 --> 01:23:25.630
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of people to get upset at</v>

1871
01:23:25.631 --> 01:23:27.940
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous ideas and then they get,</v>

1872
01:23:28.150 --> 01:23:30.970
<v Speaker 3>they go overboard and go the other way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so stupid.</v>

1873
01:23:30.971 --> 01:23:33.580
<v Speaker 3>Like Louis Ck has that bit of bad gay</v>
<v Speaker 3>people as well.</v>

1874
01:23:33.581 --> 01:23:34.414
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand.</v>

1875
01:23:34.750 --> 01:23:39.750
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand why people get angry</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the existence of gay people even if</v>

1876
01:23:39.761 --> 01:23:41.890
<v Speaker 3>they're not in their lives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like even better.</v>

1877
01:23:41.891 --> 01:23:43.210
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the gay marriage thing.</v>

1878
01:23:43.570 --> 01:23:44.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

1879
01:23:44.620 --> 01:23:47.350
<v Speaker 3>People get furious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Louie says,</v>

1880
01:23:47.351 --> 01:23:50.560
<v Speaker 3>like I would understand if like there</v>
<v Speaker 3>were a couple of guys fucking on my lawn</v>

1881
01:23:50.561 --> 01:23:52.240
<v Speaker 3>and I had to like hose him down to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

1882
01:23:52.241 --> 01:23:55.480
<v Speaker 3>Or like gay people were just like</v>
<v Speaker 3>touching their dicks in front of my face</v>

1883
01:23:55.481 --> 01:23:57.010
<v Speaker 3>as I'm trying to eat my breakfast</v>
<v Speaker 3>cereal.</v>

1884
01:23:57.100 --> 01:23:58.960
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But as long as they're not bothering me,</v>

1885
01:23:58.961 --> 01:24:02.920
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand the point in getting</v>
<v Speaker 3>upset about their mere existence out</v>

1886
01:24:02.921 --> 01:24:04.030
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1887
01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:06.760
<v Speaker 3>and it's the same with trans people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand why there's this big</v>

1888
01:24:06.761 --> 01:24:08.020
<v Speaker 3>thing about trans people.</v>

1889
01:24:08.260 --> 01:24:10.300
<v Speaker 3>I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's silly what I mean.</v>

1890
01:24:10.301 --> 01:24:15.130
<v Speaker 3>This comes to also like people who are</v>
<v Speaker 3>currently obsessed with political</v>

1891
01:24:15.131 --> 01:24:17.920
<v Speaker 3>correctness as being the biggest problem</v>
<v Speaker 3>facing America today.</v>

1892
01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:21.760
<v Speaker 3>I feel like have missed the boat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're fighting the last year's battle.</v>

1893
01:24:21.761 --> 01:24:25.150
<v Speaker 3>They're fighting yesterday's battle when</v>
<v Speaker 3>the actual battle to fight is the day</v>

1894
01:24:25.150 --> 01:24:25.601
<v Speaker 3>before yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his battle,</v>

1895
01:24:25.601 --> 01:24:28.030
<v Speaker 3>which is today's battle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a battle against bigotry,</v>

1896
01:24:28.031 --> 01:24:30.450
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a battle against trump,</v>

1897
01:24:30.451 --> 01:24:32.950
<v Speaker 3>like battle against the idea of fake</v>
<v Speaker 3>news,</v>

1898
01:24:32.951 --> 01:24:36.640
<v Speaker 3>a battle against America eventually</v>
<v Speaker 3>having its own pew.</v>

1899
01:24:36.710 --> 01:24:39.580
<v Speaker 3>Putin likes strong man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyone who's spending all of their time</v>

1900
01:24:39.581 --> 01:24:42.760
<v Speaker 3>doing all of their shows about how</v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible political correctness is.</v>

1901
01:24:42.761 --> 01:24:44.650
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Milo Yiannopoulos should be able to say</v>

1902
01:24:44.651 --> 01:24:47.570
<v Speaker 3>whatever he wants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which of course he should is not I think</v>

1903
01:24:47.571 --> 01:24:49.420
<v Speaker 3>as like well political correct.</v>

1904
01:24:49.510 --> 01:24:54.510
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is a response to people feeling that</v>

1905
01:24:55.351 --> 01:24:57.990
<v Speaker 4>there's an injustice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People feeling that there is bigotry and</v>

1906
01:24:57.991 --> 01:25:00.330
<v Speaker 4>prejudice and so they go too far with</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1907
01:25:00.331 --> 01:25:04.380
<v Speaker 4>They get ridiculous and it's also a</v>
<v Speaker 4>natural human inclination to try to</v>

1908
01:25:04.381 --> 01:25:07.800
<v Speaker 4>control other people's behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People like to be bossy and they like to</v>

1909
01:25:07.801 --> 01:25:09.780
<v Speaker 4>be able to tell you what you can and</v>
<v Speaker 4>can't do.</v>

1910
01:25:09.990 --> 01:25:12.210
<v Speaker 4>They like to tell you what words you can</v>
<v Speaker 4>and can't use.</v>

1911
01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:17.280
<v Speaker 4>It's a weird thing that people do and it</v>
<v Speaker 4>may be a response to the frustration</v>

1912
01:25:17.281 --> 01:25:21.990
<v Speaker 4>that they feel legitimate frustration</v>
<v Speaker 4>from actual bigotry and it makes them go</v>

1913
01:25:21.991 --> 01:25:24.000
<v Speaker 4>overboard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It makes them go too far.</v>

1914
01:25:24.210 --> 01:25:26.250
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a lack of perspective on both</v>

1915
01:25:26.251 --> 01:25:28.920
<v Speaker 4>sides.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a giant issue with human beings.</v>

1916
01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:29.751
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know what?</v>

1917
01:25:29.751 --> 01:25:32.480
<v Speaker 3>I think it actually was like the past</v>
<v Speaker 3>few times that we've,</v>

1918
01:25:32.580 --> 01:25:35.240
<v Speaker 3>we've gotten together and shot the shit</v>
<v Speaker 3>on this show.</v>

1919
01:25:35.690 --> 01:25:39.860
<v Speaker 3>Political correctness and the extremes</v>
<v Speaker 3>of it have been a major topic of</v>

1920
01:25:39.861 --> 01:25:42.530
<v Speaker 3>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think justly so.</v>

1921
01:25:42.860 --> 01:25:47.860
<v Speaker 3>But I do think that last year with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>election of trump and the kind of</v>

1922
01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:54.160
<v Speaker 3>welling up of kind of subtly anti</v>
<v Speaker 3>Semitic coded racially coded language</v>

1923
01:25:54.831 --> 01:25:55.640
<v Speaker 3>during the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1924
01:25:55.640 --> 01:25:59.030
<v Speaker 3>the election campaign last year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do you claim rent antisemetic when</v>

1925
01:25:59.031 --> 01:26:01.990
<v Speaker 3>jared Kushner is like his main guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I don't think trump has an anti</v>

1926
01:26:01.991 --> 01:26:04.000
<v Speaker 3>semite I don't think trump hates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So is he</v>

1927
01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.650
<v Speaker 1>a nice romantic?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people who support trump.</v>

1928
01:26:06.870 --> 01:26:08.390
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1929
01:26:08.570 --> 01:26:10.520
<v Speaker 1>But there's no evidence that he is</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1930
01:26:10.580 --> 01:26:11.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1931
01:26:11.601 --> 01:26:14.390
<v Speaker 1>I think he's just an old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an old white guy.</v>

1932
01:26:14.420 --> 01:26:17.060
<v Speaker 1>I think he's an old white guy with</v>
<v Speaker 1>traditional ideas about,</v>

1933
01:26:17.510 --> 01:26:21.470
<v Speaker 1>about what made America great and those</v>
<v Speaker 1>traditional ideas coincide with an</v>

1934
01:26:21.471 --> 01:26:26.471
<v Speaker 1>America that was a lot wider and more</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christian than the country that we say</v>

1935
01:26:26.721 --> 01:26:28.460
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the way it becomes</v>

1936
01:26:28.461 --> 01:26:31.460
<v Speaker 1>racially coded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never even been a religious person.</v>

1937
01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:33.860
<v Speaker 1>Really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it?</v>

1938
01:26:33.980 --> 01:26:37.000
<v Speaker 1>Talk about no children of God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should be forced to suffer.</v>

1939
01:26:37.001 --> 01:26:39.140
<v Speaker 1>Shut to feet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>such a fraud.</v>

1940
01:26:39.141 --> 01:26:42.290
<v Speaker 1>He's such a go and get your steak knives</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your trump university dude.</v>

1941
01:26:42.291 --> 01:26:42.921
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1942
01:26:42.921 --> 01:26:44.690
<v Speaker 1>he's a charlatan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump steaks,</v>

1943
01:26:45.160 --> 01:26:46.730
<v Speaker 1>steaks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>

1944
01:26:46.731 --> 01:26:49.880
<v Speaker 1>Shizzy how fucking corrupt the religious</v>
<v Speaker 1>right off.</v>

1945
01:26:49.890 --> 01:26:51.740
<v Speaker 1>I haven't gotten behind him so quickly.</v>

1946
01:26:51.890 --> 01:26:53.840
<v Speaker 1>When he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he went down to Liberty University.</v>

1947
01:26:53.841 --> 01:26:54.950
<v Speaker 1>He gave a speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

1948
01:26:55.370 --> 01:26:57.530
<v Speaker 1>you know the my favorite part of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bible,</v>

1949
01:26:57.560 --> 01:27:01.130
<v Speaker 1>two Corinthians pronounced two</v>
<v Speaker 1>Corinthians.</v>

1950
01:27:01.131 --> 01:27:03.680
<v Speaker 1>It's second Corinthians every evening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you just went to,</v>

1951
01:27:04.230 --> 01:27:05.900
<v Speaker 1>went to Bible school when you were a</v>
<v Speaker 1>kid,</v>

1952
01:27:05.901 --> 01:27:08.390
<v Speaker 1>you remember that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they know he's a fraud.</v>

1953
01:27:08.810 --> 01:27:11.030
<v Speaker 1>He was asked by an interviewer or what</v>
<v Speaker 1>his favorite part of the Bible is.</v>

1954
01:27:11.031 --> 01:27:11.601
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1955
01:27:11.601 --> 01:27:13.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to get into that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>personal,</v>

1956
01:27:13.190 --> 01:27:14.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's personal.</v>

1957
01:27:14.490 --> 01:27:17.480
<v Speaker 1>He hadn't read the fucking Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't pray.</v>

1958
01:27:17.481 --> 01:27:20.200
<v Speaker 1>He's got his own Bible going to answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote it exactly.</v>

1959
01:27:20.210 --> 01:27:23.990
<v Speaker 1>This is where I'm at night in his</v>
<v Speaker 1>underwear and he talks and somebody</v>

1960
01:27:23.991 --> 01:27:26.510
<v Speaker 1>writes it down one day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'll be the Bible.</v>

1961
01:27:26.511 --> 01:27:28.880
<v Speaker 1>The Best Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd been an amazing Bible.</v>

1962
01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:31.540
<v Speaker 1>So they're all corrupt and full of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1963
01:27:31.550 --> 01:27:33.080
<v Speaker 1>the religious right for getting behind</v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

1964
01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:35.870
<v Speaker 1>When they always talk about how</v>
<v Speaker 1>important personal faith is in that,</v>

1965
01:27:35.930 --> 01:27:38.480
<v Speaker 1>in their candidates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What else are they going to do?</v>

1966
01:27:38.481 --> 01:27:39.890
<v Speaker 1>They go towards Hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1967
01:27:39.891 --> 01:27:40.970
<v Speaker 1>what are we going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1968
01:27:40.971 --> 01:27:42.440
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean during the primary,</v>

1969
01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:44.660
<v Speaker 1>but who else would they go with?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's going to win.</v>

1970
01:27:44.690 --> 01:27:47.210
<v Speaker 1>They knew he was Ted Cruz didn't have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>shot.</v>

1971
01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:50.060
<v Speaker 1>He's too wormy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People see him sweat too much.</v>

1972
01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:51.950
<v Speaker 1>It's too of weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Easily lost the election.</v>

1973
01:27:51.951 --> 01:27:53.450
<v Speaker 1>But what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I'm saying is they would</v>

1974
01:27:53.451 --> 01:27:54.950
<v Speaker 1>rather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1975
01:27:54.951 --> 01:27:56.810
<v Speaker 1>they would rather have Donald Trump win</v>
<v Speaker 1>the election.</v>

1976
01:27:56.811 --> 01:27:59.620
<v Speaker 1>Then have ted Cruz will lose the</v>
<v Speaker 1>election on with principles,</v>

1977
01:28:00.220 --> 01:28:02.390
<v Speaker 1>which is amazing because you now you see</v>
<v Speaker 1>people saying,</v>

1978
01:28:02.391 --> 01:28:05.960
<v Speaker 1>I wish Ted Cruz was in office.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a lot of people on the left</v>

1979
01:28:05.961 --> 01:28:07.520
<v Speaker 1>that would have been happy with Ted</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cruz.</v>

1980
01:28:07.730 --> 01:28:08.481
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1981
01:28:08.481 --> 01:28:09.350

1982
01:28:09.351 --> 01:28:13.550

<v Speaker 1>He's very anti gay and he's very smart.</v>

1983
01:28:13.550 --> 01:28:14.480
<v Speaker 1>He's extremely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1984
01:28:14.481 --> 01:28:17.480
<v Speaker 1>he was like a champion of the Harvard</v>
<v Speaker 1>debating team.</v>

1985
01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:19.130
<v Speaker 1>Apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was Harvard.</v>

1986
01:28:19.380 --> 01:28:22.180
<v Speaker 1>I think he's gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I reckon.</v>

1987
01:28:22.700 --> 01:28:25.250
<v Speaker 1>You Reckon?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think when you look at them?</v>

1988

<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1993
01:28:32.541 --> 01:28:34.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty good at it.</v>

1994
01:28:34.081 --> 01:28:35.960
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think really?</v>

1995
01:28:35.990 --> 01:28:36.960
<v Speaker 1>He gives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

1996
01:28:37.540 --> 01:28:39.080
<v Speaker 1>on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the conservative,</v>

1997
01:28:39.081 --> 01:28:42.520
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a fine line between slimy ass</v>

1998
01:28:42.521 --> 01:28:45.110
<v Speaker 1>hole and closeted gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1999
01:28:45.140 --> 01:28:47.270
<v Speaker 1>You don't think there's some connection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

2000
01:28:47.540 --> 01:28:48.990
<v Speaker 1>some like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well no,</v>

2001
01:28:49.250 --> 01:28:51.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying they could rise or</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship.</v>

2002
01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:54.500
<v Speaker 1>It could be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the problem is that they never</v>

2003
01:28:54.501 --> 01:28:58.610
<v Speaker 1>underlying root system fungus that sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of connects.</v>

2004
01:28:59.420 --> 01:29:02.070
<v Speaker 1>They communicate via electronic using</v>
<v Speaker 1>fungal.</v>

2005
01:29:02.220 --> 01:29:03.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Deep under the surface.</v>

2006
01:29:03.540 --> 01:29:05.880
<v Speaker 1>Pray the gay away as possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they often are.</v>

2007
01:29:05.910 --> 01:29:08.220
<v Speaker 1>They also like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ted Haggard is a good example.</v>

2008
01:29:08.550 --> 01:29:09.810
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You remember that guy?</v>

2009
01:29:09.811 --> 01:29:11.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

2010
01:29:12.060 --> 01:29:13.460
<v Speaker 1>he seemed gay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't he?</v>

2011
01:29:13.461 --> 01:29:17.070
<v Speaker 1>He had a little like his sibilance swear</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit.</v>

2012
01:29:17.300 --> 01:29:21.550
<v Speaker 1>S E s s list bees and gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I didn't get it.</v>

2013
01:29:22.020 --> 01:29:26.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't know cause I'm like obviously</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the most gay presenting person that</v>

2014
01:29:26.281 --> 01:29:27.960
<v Speaker 1>you've ever met.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think that work.</v>

2015
01:29:28.380 --> 01:29:29.213
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2016
01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:32.160
<v Speaker 1>It's fascinating though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't that present as gay?</v>

2017
01:29:32.870 --> 01:29:34.680
<v Speaker 1>Here's part of the thing about gender as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

2018
01:29:34.681 --> 01:29:36.600
<v Speaker 1>This is the right is it brings us back</v>
<v Speaker 1>to Rachel dollars,</v>

2019
01:29:36.601 --> 01:29:38.100
<v Speaker 1>Ireland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rice and stuff like that.</v>

2020
01:29:38.101 --> 01:29:43.101
<v Speaker 1>Like obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so maybe there is some biological reason</v>

2021
01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:49.160
<v Speaker 1>why do to or attracted to dude's tend to</v>
<v Speaker 1>exhibit mannerisms that are more</v>

2022
01:29:51.361 --> 01:29:53.850
<v Speaker 1>commonly associated with femininity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2023
01:29:53.851 --> 01:29:57.570
<v Speaker 1>Maybe a sing song.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He voice I certain style of walking,</v>

2024
01:29:57.720 --> 01:30:02.720
<v Speaker 1>Swish sashaying a swishy sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>my friends that I was talking to about</v>

2025
01:30:03.091 --> 01:30:03.924
<v Speaker 1>the coppell.</v>

2026
01:30:03.990 --> 01:30:06.290
<v Speaker 1>Very clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Male and female and the relation,</v>

2027
01:30:06.320 --> 01:30:09.220
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them does appear gay.</v>

2028
01:30:09.221 --> 01:30:10.740
<v Speaker 1>Like if you got him to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh that's a gay guy,</v>

2029
01:30:11.040 --> 01:30:13.200
<v Speaker 1>but the other guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would have to know him.</v>

2030
01:30:13.320 --> 01:30:14.850
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't know.</v>

2031
01:30:15.060 --> 01:30:17.850
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then so what I think if there's a</v>

2032
01:30:17.851 --> 01:30:21.600
<v Speaker 1>kernel of biology in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's been ramped up aggressively</v>

2033
01:30:21.601 --> 01:30:25.890
<v Speaker 1>over the past century by people also</v>
<v Speaker 1>playing the role of gay in the same way</v>

2034
01:30:25.891 --> 01:30:28.710
<v Speaker 1>that masculine dudes play the role of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2035
01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:33.060
<v Speaker 1>masculine structures will play the role</v>
<v Speaker 1>of masculinity and girls will play the</v>

2036
01:30:33.061 --> 01:30:37.290
<v Speaker 1>role of being girly and in that respect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who point out the gender is not</v>

2037
01:30:37.291 --> 01:30:41.370
<v Speaker 1>the same as sex or right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like gender is a bunch of behavioral</v>

2038
01:30:42.120 --> 01:30:45.960
<v Speaker 1>tropes that we will act out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's interesting to me like when</v>

2039
01:30:45.961 --> 01:30:48.870
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are Gay People Gay People Act Gay.</v>

2040
01:30:50.190 --> 01:30:52.160
<v Speaker 1>Part of it must be an act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was theirs?</v>

2041
01:30:52.290 --> 01:30:54.830
<v Speaker 1>Maybe to telegraph to each other maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2042
01:30:55.200 --> 01:31:00.150
<v Speaker 1>But there's also just this broad</v>
<v Speaker 1>spectrum of individuals is so different.</v>

2043
01:31:00.450 --> 01:31:01.283
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

2044
01:31:01.410 --> 01:31:04.890
<v Speaker 1>there's masculine people that are so</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly different than other</v>

2045
01:31:04.891 --> 01:31:07.950
<v Speaker 1>masculine people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Feminine Women that are so incredibly</v>

2046
01:31:07.951 --> 01:31:10.380
<v Speaker 1>different than other feminine women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean just people were,</v>

2047
01:31:10.530 --> 01:31:14.560
<v Speaker 1>they vary very widely biologically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>socially they,</v>

2048
01:31:14.660 --> 01:31:17.730
<v Speaker 1>they vary by their own neurochemistry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2049
01:31:17.731 --> 01:31:20.700
<v Speaker 1>there's people that are just almost</v>
<v Speaker 1>naturally inclined to be depressed.</v>

2050
01:31:20.940 --> 01:31:23.610
<v Speaker 1>There's some people that you could shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>right in their hair and they'd be</v>

2051
01:31:23.611 --> 01:31:25.410
<v Speaker 1>fucking happiest peaches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

2052
01:31:25.710 --> 01:31:26.850
<v Speaker 1>people are weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2053
01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:29.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm a pretty happy person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where do you think you lie on that</v>

2054
01:31:29.251 --> 01:31:31.170
<v Speaker 1>spectrum of happiness?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty happy.</v>

2055
01:31:31.320 --> 01:31:32.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I worked at it.</v>

2056
01:31:33.450 --> 01:31:38.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty aware of the pitfalls of like</v>
<v Speaker 1>inactivity and I'm very,</v>

2057
01:31:39.361 --> 01:31:41.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I exercise a lot,</v>

2058
01:31:41.280 --> 01:31:45.060
<v Speaker 1>but even how the ability to motivate</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself to take action is also</v>

2059
01:31:45.061 --> 01:31:48.480
<v Speaker 1>something that you'll need to have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2060
01:31:48.481 --> 01:31:51.150
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But how much of that is from learned</v>

2061
01:31:51.151 --> 01:31:54.480
<v Speaker 1>behavior?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much of that is from what,</v>

2062
01:31:54.570 --> 01:31:56.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way I grew up,</v>

2063
01:31:56.160 --> 01:31:57.540
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of factors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2064
01:31:57.810 --> 01:31:58.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are,</v>

2065
01:31:58.590 --> 01:32:00.580
<v Speaker 1>my parents did not exercise</v>

2066
01:32:00.940 --> 01:32:03.550
<v Speaker 4>at all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like fucking zero.</v>

2067
01:32:03.790 --> 01:32:05.350
<v Speaker 4>When I was growing up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Zero.</v>

2068
01:32:05.730 --> 01:32:08.470
<v Speaker 4>They would come home from work and drink</v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

2069
01:32:08.890 --> 01:32:10.120
<v Speaker 4>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just was like,</v>

2070
01:32:10.660 --> 01:32:14.110
<v Speaker 4>I gotta do something with this body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This body wants to go to war.</v>

2071
01:32:14.140 --> 01:32:17.290
<v Speaker 4>I gotta I gotta get out and run.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I gotta hit a punching bag.</v>

2072
01:32:17.291 --> 01:32:18.760
<v Speaker 4>I've got to lift some weight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've got to do something.</v>

2073
01:32:19.210 --> 01:32:20.950
<v Speaker 4>I was just always like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>

2074
01:32:20.980 --> 01:32:24.730
<v Speaker 4>like I felt like there was an engine</v>
<v Speaker 4>inside of me that was revving up all the</v>

2075
01:32:24.731 --> 01:32:26.800
<v Speaker 4>time and I had to go run it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I didn't,</v>

2076
01:32:26.890 --> 01:32:31.890
<v Speaker 4>I didn't get out there and push it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't feel calm and it took me till I</v>

2077
01:32:32.381 --> 01:32:34.300
<v Speaker 4>was like a teenager before I figured</v>
<v Speaker 4>that out.</v>

2078
01:32:34.540 --> 01:32:36.820
<v Speaker 4>And then once I figured that out and</v>
<v Speaker 4>once I started exercising,</v>

2079
01:32:36.821 --> 01:32:40.900
<v Speaker 4>it was like there was me pre working out</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then me,</v>

2080
01:32:41.320 --> 01:32:41.681
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2081
01:32:41.681 --> 01:32:44.190
<v Speaker 4>now I can think now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I realized I was a kid.</v>

2082
01:32:44.191 --> 01:32:45.970
<v Speaker 4>I was under the influence of biology for</v>

2083
01:32:46.430 --> 01:32:46.731
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2084
01:32:46.731 --> 01:32:49.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're lucky that you didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>channel that into drugs or,</v>

2085
01:32:49.960 --> 01:32:52.710
<v Speaker 1>or alcohol or aggression drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Flora question.</v>

2086
01:32:52.740 --> 01:32:53.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2087
01:32:53.070 --> 01:32:55.420
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Violence is the real worry like that.</v>

2088
01:32:56.190 --> 01:33:01.190
<v Speaker 4>That's a giant issue with boys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you see kids playing and I was at a</v>

2089
01:33:01.711 --> 01:33:04.230
<v Speaker 4>party recently,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a little kid's party.</v>

2090
01:33:04.500 --> 01:33:07.340
<v Speaker 4>It was an adult party.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Children's Patty.</v>

2091
01:33:08.600 --> 01:33:09.600
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Little kids.</v>

2092
01:33:09.601 --> 01:33:10.850
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

2093
01:33:10.870 --> 01:33:15.870
<v Speaker 4>there was this one boy and this one boy</v>
<v Speaker 4>has these two parents that had kids late</v>

2094
01:33:16.261 --> 01:33:17.400
<v Speaker 4>in life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they weren't really paying</v>

2095
01:33:17.401 --> 01:33:19.410
<v Speaker 4>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were inside drinking and this kid</v>

2096
01:33:19.411 --> 01:33:21.930
<v Speaker 4>was fucking hyper aggressive running</v>
<v Speaker 4>around,</v>

2097
01:33:22.170 --> 01:33:24.720
<v Speaker 4>pushing kids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He hit kids.</v>

2098
01:33:25.130 --> 01:33:27.570
<v Speaker 4>I've watched him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I watched him a call,</v>

2099
01:33:27.571 --> 01:33:31.200
<v Speaker 4>this kid a loser and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2100
01:33:31.260 --> 01:33:34.530
<v Speaker 4>I had to have a conversation with the</v>
<v Speaker 4>dad and I'm like,</v>

2101
01:33:34.531 --> 01:33:36.360
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

<v Speaker 4>he's a good kid.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2104
01:33:38.700 --> 01:33:40.620

<v Speaker 4>It's so hard because you want to say,</v>

2105
01:33:40.621 --> 01:33:42.690
<v Speaker 4>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you ain't even fucking watching your</v>

<v Speaker 4>kid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You read your drinking.</v>

2108
01:33:45.361 --> 01:33:47.770

<v Speaker 4>I saw him push his kid and him illusory.</v>

2109
01:33:47.780 --> 01:33:48.960
<v Speaker 4>Like that never happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

2110
01:33:49.380 --> 01:33:51.180
<v Speaker 4>oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

2111
01:33:51.181 --> 01:33:53.370
<v Speaker 4>I look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to apologize cause his kid</v>

2112
01:33:53.371 --> 01:33:55.650
<v Speaker 4>did something cause I'm trying to</v>
<v Speaker 4>apologize for his behavior.</v>

2113
01:33:55.680 --> 01:33:57.060
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not apologizing.</v>

2114
01:33:57.061 --> 01:33:58.620
<v Speaker 4>You're saying he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he didn't do anything.</v>

2115
01:33:58.940 --> 01:33:59.511
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all right mate,</v>

2116
01:33:59.511 --> 01:34:00.300
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry.</v>

2117
01:34:00.300 --> 01:34:02.460
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry that this is the case,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this is what happened.</v>

2118
01:34:02.870 --> 01:34:06.080
<v Speaker 1>What is it with parents defending their</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids so much these days?</v>

2119
01:34:06.081 --> 01:34:08.830
<v Speaker 1>If say if a parent had come up to my</v>
<v Speaker 1>parents when I was little kid and told</v>

2120
01:34:08.831 --> 01:34:10.280
<v Speaker 1>them that I'd been doing something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2121
01:34:10.430 --> 01:34:14.600
<v Speaker 1>it would have been the grownups</v>
<v Speaker 1>gathering together against the child in</v>

2122
01:34:14.601 --> 01:34:16.640
<v Speaker 1>order to kind of communally raise the</v>
<v Speaker 1>child.</v>

2123
01:34:16.641 --> 01:34:16.890
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2124
01:34:16.890 --> 01:34:18.740
<v Speaker 1>my dad would not have said that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't do that.</v>

2125
01:34:18.890 --> 01:34:20.990
<v Speaker 1>He will come up to me and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you do that?</v>

2126
01:34:21.240 --> 01:34:24.090
<v Speaker 4>This guy and his wife were both</v>
<v Speaker 4>drinking.</v>

2127
01:34:24.210 --> 01:34:27.600
<v Speaker 4>That could have definitely been a factor</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there was a factor in me not pushing</v>

2128
01:34:27.601 --> 01:34:30.420
<v Speaker 4>it because I didn't want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because first of all he,</v>

2129
01:34:30.510 --> 01:34:33.630
<v Speaker 4>when a guy says to you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that didn't happen when you know it</v>

2130
01:34:33.631 --> 01:34:36.300
<v Speaker 4>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did you are two steps away from beating</v>

2131
01:34:36.301 --> 01:34:36.840
<v Speaker 4>the fuck</v>

2132
01:34:36.840 --> 01:34:39.500
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were there exactly what happened.</v>

2133
01:34:39.501 --> 01:34:42.380
<v Speaker 1>How does he know that it didn't happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's such a weird thing to say.</v>

2134
01:34:42.410 --> 01:34:44.990
<v Speaker 1>We're two steps away from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well he wasn't watching this kid at all.</v>

2135
01:34:45.030 --> 01:34:46.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And His kid.</v>

2136
01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:46.980
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

2137
01:34:46.980 --> 01:34:51.950
<v Speaker 1>they had to go to visit his kid because</v>
<v Speaker 1>this kid hit other kids on three</v>

2138
01:34:51.951 --> 01:34:55.760
<v Speaker 1>occasions and it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has really good grounds for believing</v>

2139
01:34:55.761 --> 01:34:57.980
<v Speaker 1>that it never happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's party over</v>

2140
01:34:57.980 --> 01:34:59.120
<v Speaker 4>a course of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2141
01:34:59.150 --> 01:35:00.890
<v Speaker 4>this is over a course of a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 4>hours.</v>

2142
01:35:00.891 --> 01:35:05.891
<v Speaker 4>This kid hit three kids and so when you</v>
<v Speaker 4>say to a guy that your kids really</v>

2143
01:35:06.531 --> 01:35:07.161
<v Speaker 4>aggressive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's like,</v>

2144
01:35:07.161 --> 01:35:08.120
<v Speaker 4>he's a good kid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2145
01:35:08.270 --> 01:35:09.290
<v Speaker 4>no he's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a good kid.</v>

2146
01:35:09.470 --> 01:35:10.430
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a good kid.</v>

2147
01:35:10.590 --> 01:35:14.090
<v Speaker 4>You don't even fucking know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe he's a good kid who's being</v>

2148
01:35:14.091 --> 01:35:16.430
<v Speaker 4>aggressive right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't change what I saw,</v>

2149
01:35:16.490 --> 01:35:19.430
<v Speaker 4>but what I'm saying is kids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially boys,</v>

2150
01:35:19.460 --> 01:35:23.090
<v Speaker 4>they have this thing inside of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some of them do,</v>

2151
01:35:23.091 --> 01:35:25.040
<v Speaker 4>some of them don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

2152
01:35:25.070 --> 01:35:28.700
<v Speaker 4>we very biologically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but some of them have this aggressive</v>

2153
01:35:28.701 --> 01:35:31.250
<v Speaker 4>tendency.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why boys like to play football.</v>

2154
01:35:31.460 --> 01:35:34.940
<v Speaker 4>It's why boys gravitate to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or some boys gravitate towards</v>

2155
01:35:34.941 --> 01:35:38.090
<v Speaker 4>aggressive activities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They got to get it out of their system.</v>

2156
01:35:38.270 --> 01:35:40.700
<v Speaker 4>You got to exercise with that kid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got to do something with them,</v>

2157
01:35:41.090 --> 01:35:42.860
<v Speaker 4>play catch with them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>run around with them.</v>

2158
01:35:42.980 --> 01:35:46.490
<v Speaker 4>Where I'm out there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people are not meant to sit down,</v>

2159
01:35:46.670 --> 01:35:50.570
<v Speaker 4>it'll fucking classroom and just pay</v>
<v Speaker 4>attention all day to some shit they</v>

2160
01:35:50.571 --> 01:35:53.720
<v Speaker 4>don't want to pay attention to and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>go home and sit in front of the TV.</v>

2161
01:35:53.840 --> 01:35:56.130
<v Speaker 4>And what do they do with all that energy</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they put them on?</v>

2162
01:35:56.131 --> 01:35:59.090
<v Speaker 4>Adrenaline that kept us from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2163
01:35:59.690 --> 01:36:01.820
<v Speaker 4>kept us alive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kept us from predators,</v>

2164
01:36:01.940 --> 01:36:05.840
<v Speaker 4>kept us from invaders mean that all that</v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff is biologically programmed in the</v>

2165
01:36:05.841 --> 01:36:07.940
<v Speaker 4>human animal and we ignore it.</v>

2166
01:36:07.980 --> 01:36:11.100
<v Speaker 3>You're leading very transphobic by</v>
<v Speaker 3>implying that there something male</v>

2167
01:36:11.340 --> 01:36:13.710
<v Speaker 3>intrinsically transphobic or is it</v>
<v Speaker 3>gender?</v>

2168
01:36:13.770 --> 01:36:15.810
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gender Essential Ism.</v>

2169
01:36:15.811 --> 01:36:17.210
<v Speaker 3>I think that's what it's called.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2170
01:36:17.220 --> 01:36:18.630
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm with you and this is a problem.</v>

2171
01:36:18.631 --> 01:36:21.600
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is a problem about the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about fatherhood,</v>

2172
01:36:21.630 --> 01:36:22.820
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's something I'm thinking about,</v>

2173
01:36:22.850 --> 01:36:24.510
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about now that I'm about to become a</v>

2174
01:36:24.511 --> 01:36:25.081
<v Speaker 3>file.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2175
01:36:25.081 --> 01:36:26.970
<v Speaker 3>how do I run around?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take care of too.</v>

2176

<v Speaker 3>And how do I also make sure that like</v>

2177
01:36:29.070 --> 01:36:33.080
<v Speaker 3>they grow up with good masculine role</v>
<v Speaker 3>models and people and then I give that,</v>

2178
01:36:33.081 --> 01:36:37.110
<v Speaker 3>enable them to be the best kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 3>human beings that they want to flourish</v>

2179
01:36:37.111 --> 01:36:38.670
<v Speaker 3>into.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you've got the whole question</v>

2180
01:36:38.671 --> 01:36:41.260
<v Speaker 3>of adderall and Ritalin and saw on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

<v Speaker 3>My neighbor put their kid on Ritalin,</v>

2182
01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:44.990
<v Speaker 3>one of them</v>

<v Speaker 4>They had this kid and he wasn't a bad</v>

2185
01:36:48.621 --> 01:36:50.720
<v Speaker 4>kid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was just fucking ignored.</v>

2186
01:36:50.721 --> 01:36:52.280
<v Speaker 4>The same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The wife,</v>

<v Speaker 4>the wife was always trying to get dick</v>
<v Speaker 4>from everybody.</v>

<v Speaker 4>just fucking like dealing with this</v>

2190
01:37:00.861 --> 01:37:02.840
<v Speaker 4>crazy bitch for a wife.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He didn't want to be there.</v>

2191
01:37:03.080 --> 01:37:06.200
<v Speaker 4>He would work late and this poor kid was</v>
<v Speaker 4>just bouncing off the walls.</v>

2192
01:37:06.201 --> 01:37:07.070
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they put them on drugs,</v>

2193
01:37:07.071 --> 01:37:07.440
<v Speaker 4>dogs</v>

2194
01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:08.380
<v Speaker 3>as I am.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a,</v>

2195
01:37:08.550 --> 01:37:10.840
<v Speaker 3>an economist called Tyler Cowen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you know of,</v>

2196
01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:11.870
<v Speaker 3>of Tyler.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was,</v>

2197
01:37:11.871 --> 01:37:13.160
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would have,</v>

2198
01:37:13.190 --> 01:37:16.910
<v Speaker 3>he's the kind of guy who now that he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>in his mid fifties says that he's sure</v>

2199
01:37:16.911 --> 01:37:19.820
<v Speaker 3>that when he was younger he would have</v>
<v Speaker 3>been medicated if it were,</v>

2200
01:37:20.090 --> 01:37:21.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

2201
01:37:21.230 --> 01:37:24.560
<v Speaker 3>if he were a young person today and he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the point that he was making about</v>

2202
01:37:24.561 --> 01:37:29.561
<v Speaker 3>that was that human psychology is</v>
<v Speaker 3>complicated and there's no sort of Yin</v>

2203
01:37:30.171 --> 01:37:31.310
<v Speaker 3>without the Yang.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2204
01:37:31.340 --> 01:37:36.340
<v Speaker 3>Like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the distractedness that he had was bad</v>

2205
01:37:36.861 --> 01:37:39.800
<v Speaker 3>if what you wanted was for him to sit</v>
<v Speaker 3>still in class and pay attention to</v>

2206
01:37:39.801 --> 01:37:41.340
<v Speaker 3>something that he wasn't interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2207
01:37:41.570 --> 01:37:45.890
<v Speaker 3>But fantastic in a whole bunch of other</v>
<v Speaker 3>ways that he thinks were invaluable.</v>

2208
01:37:45.920 --> 01:37:46.753
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2209
01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:48.790
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my best friend Sam and Australia,</v>

2210
01:37:48.830 --> 01:37:52.220
<v Speaker 3>who is a brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like soil scientist,</v>

2211
01:37:52.221 --> 01:37:56.010
<v Speaker 3>one of the countries and possibly the</v>
<v Speaker 3>world's best scientists in his field has</v>

2212
01:37:56.011 --> 01:37:57.050
<v Speaker 3>a phd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>

2213
01:37:57.110 --> 01:38:00.270
<v Speaker 3>if we'd been growing up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if instead of being born when we were</v>

2214
01:38:00.271 --> 01:38:02.790
<v Speaker 3>born,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd been born just 10 years later.</v>

2215
01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:05.160
<v Speaker 3>What would his creative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would have happened to his</v>

2216
01:38:05.161 --> 01:38:09.300
<v Speaker 3>creativity if he'd been medicated in</v>
<v Speaker 3>order to be able to get through class</v>

2217
01:38:09.301 --> 01:38:10.140
<v Speaker 3>because he was always</v>

2218
01:38:10.610 --> 01:38:12.110
<v Speaker 4>distracted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Parents don't care.</v>

2219
01:38:12.111 --> 01:38:14.480
<v Speaker 4>They want convenience,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially parents at work all day.</v>

2220
01:38:14.570 --> 01:38:18.320
<v Speaker 4>They work all day and they come home and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they want this kid to fucking behave</v>

2221
01:38:18.321 --> 01:38:22.070
<v Speaker 4>because they're tired and they want this</v>
<v Speaker 4>life that they see in movies and in</v>

2222
01:38:22.071 --> 01:38:24.050
<v Speaker 4>television shows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't know what it's like to raise</v>

2223
01:38:24.051 --> 01:38:27.650
<v Speaker 4>a human being.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very complex and you know,</v>

2224
01:38:27.651 --> 01:38:30.950
<v Speaker 4>especially when you're sending these</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking kids to schools that they</v>

2225
01:38:30.951 --> 01:38:35.210
<v Speaker 4>promote these rigid ideas of how</v>
<v Speaker 4>children are supposed to behave and you</v>

2226
01:38:35.211 --> 01:38:38.030
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and tell you that if you don't follow</v>

2227
01:38:38.031 --> 01:38:39.590
<v Speaker 4>the rules,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not going to be successful.</v>

2228
01:38:39.591 --> 01:38:43.580
<v Speaker 4>I mean how many fucking stories have you</v>
<v Speaker 4>heard where teachers tell rowdy kids</v>

2229
01:38:43.581 --> 01:38:44.690
<v Speaker 4>they're never going to amount to</v>
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>

2230
01:38:45.050 --> 01:38:47.450
<v Speaker 4>I had a teacher tell it to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll never fucking forget it.</v>

2231
01:38:47.480 --> 01:38:49.340
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My head that as well cause she was just</v>

2232
01:38:49.341 --> 01:38:51.050
<v Speaker 4>so dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She was so,</v>

2233
01:38:51.080 --> 01:38:53.360
<v Speaker 4>she was so dominant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>such a bad teacher.</v>

2234
01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:56.710
<v Speaker 4>And I was a terrible student.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean she was certainly frustrated ms</v>

2235
01:38:56.720 --> 01:38:57.710
<v Speaker 4>public schools.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2236
01:38:58.160 --> 01:38:58.993
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2237
01:38:59.030 --> 01:39:01.430
<v Speaker 4>I said something and she was a black</v>
<v Speaker 4>woman,</v>

2238
01:39:01.431 --> 01:39:03.740
<v Speaker 4>had terrible accent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She,</v>

2239
01:39:03.741 --> 01:39:06.860
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>had a very bad ebonics accent and I was,</v>

2240
01:39:06.861 --> 01:39:09.410
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>talking to my friend and she goes,</v>

2241
01:39:09.411 --> 01:39:11.240
<v Speaker 4>Mr Rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>would you like to come up here and do</v>

2242
01:39:11.241 --> 01:39:12.950
<v Speaker 4>both of these problems in front of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>class?</v>

2243
01:39:13.130 --> 01:39:15.200
<v Speaker 4>So I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>would you like me to do both of those</v>

2244
01:39:15.201 --> 01:39:18.160
<v Speaker 4>problems?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And everybody,</v>

2245
01:39:18.500 --> 01:39:21.170
<v Speaker 4>everybody started laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Harla kids were like,</v>

2246
01:39:21.200 --> 01:39:24.080
<v Speaker 4>oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so she kicked me out of class for</v>

2247
01:39:24.081 --> 01:39:27.950
<v Speaker 4>that and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all I did was talk the way you talk and</v>

2248
01:39:27.951 --> 01:39:29.060
<v Speaker 4>you kicked me out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

2249
01:39:29.061 --> 01:39:30.590
<v Speaker 4>just because you're teaching a math</v>
<v Speaker 4>class.</v>

2250
01:39:30.680 --> 01:39:31.760
<v Speaker 4>Shinny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>learned how to talk,</v>

2251
01:39:32.330 --> 01:39:34.970
<v Speaker 4>shitting learned.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I taught correctly for our students and</v>

2252
01:39:34.971 --> 01:39:37.430
<v Speaker 4>she kicked me out and she,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember said,</v>

2253
01:39:37.580 --> 01:39:39.050
<v Speaker 4>go ahead,</v>
<v Speaker 4>laugh at Mr Rogan.</v>

2254
01:39:39.050 --> 01:39:41.450
<v Speaker 4>Mr Rogan has never gonna amount to</v>
<v Speaker 4>anything in life.</v>

2255
01:39:41.630 --> 01:39:43.400
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Unlike being a public school teacher,</v>

2256
01:39:43.490 --> 01:39:45.230
<v Speaker 4>but I rent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's nothing wrong with being a public</v>

2257
01:39:45.231 --> 01:39:46.910
<v Speaker 4>school teacher.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just saying she didn't amend it very</v>

2258
01:39:46.911 --> 01:39:48.050
<v Speaker 4>much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not true.</v>

2259
01:39:48.051 --> 01:39:51.650
<v Speaker 4>It's a great job if you do it right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What I'm saying has influence over</v>

2260
01:39:51.651 --> 01:39:53.750
<v Speaker 4>people at school.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Teachers are worthless and should be</v>

2261
01:39:53.751 --> 01:39:56.180
<v Speaker 4>executed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's precisely the boy.</v>

2262
01:39:57.060 --> 01:39:58.490
<v Speaker 4>So rude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

2263
01:39:58.491 --> 01:40:00.800
<v Speaker 4>you're not even American and come over</v>
<v Speaker 4>and say that shit.</v>

2264
01:40:00.980 --> 01:40:02.330
<v Speaker 4>We have public school teachers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2265
01:40:02.331 --> 01:40:05.960
<v Speaker 4>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love that she's saying that it's cause</v>

2266
01:40:05.961 --> 01:40:09.000
<v Speaker 4>she's a cunt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She was not a nice,</v>

2267
01:40:09.010 --> 01:40:09.630
<v Speaker 4>we should be</v>

2268
01:40:09.630 --> 01:40:12.210
<v Speaker 3>sizing her not for her occupation but</v>
<v Speaker 3>for her constant.</v>

2269
01:40:12.390 --> 01:40:15.260
<v Speaker 4>What's a fucking horrible job man?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I wouldn't want to deal with me</v>

2270
01:40:15.520 --> 01:40:18.180
<v Speaker 4>when I was 15 yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who the hell wants to deal with a 15</v>

2271
01:40:18.181 --> 01:40:20.070
<v Speaker 4>year old boy who doesn't want to pay</v>
<v Speaker 4>attention?</v>

2272
01:40:20.071 --> 01:40:23.790
<v Speaker 4>Who doesn't give a shit about math,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know she left a weak spot,</v>

2273
01:40:24.140 --> 01:40:25.100
<v Speaker 3>do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2274
01:40:25.101 --> 01:40:28.340
<v Speaker 3>it also the whole question of like how</v>
<v Speaker 3>of speaking?</v>

2275
01:40:28.341 --> 01:40:30.620
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a teacher,</v>

2276
01:40:30.650 --> 01:40:34.430
<v Speaker 3>if you're an educator then you sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to have your shit together.</v>

2277
01:40:34.490 --> 01:40:37.910
<v Speaker 3>In terms of being educated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then that also bumps up against,</v>

2278
01:40:37.911 --> 01:40:42.530
<v Speaker 3>are we being racist by implying that</v>
<v Speaker 3>black American English is less educated</v>

2279
01:40:42.770 --> 01:40:46.510
<v Speaker 3>than standard white English?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause some people argue that the,</v>

2280
01:40:46.610 --> 01:40:50.450
<v Speaker 3>that black English is just a dialect of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the language.</v>

2281
01:40:50.730 --> 01:40:53.920
<v Speaker 4>Well you could argue that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know what the same would be held</v>

2282
01:40:53.950 --> 01:40:56.380
<v Speaker 4>if this was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is in Massachusetts.</v>

2283
01:40:56.590 --> 01:41:00.790
<v Speaker 4>The same will be held if it was a guy</v>
<v Speaker 4>who was a teacher who had a ridiculous</v>

2284
01:41:00.791 --> 01:41:04.000
<v Speaker 4>Boston accent and I've marked his Boston</v>
<v Speaker 4>accent.</v>

2285
01:41:04.360 --> 01:41:05.340
<v Speaker 4>Like if he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2286
01:41:05.341 --> 01:41:07.420
<v Speaker 4>you know something about pack you</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking cat.</v>

2287
01:41:07.780 --> 01:41:09.910
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>would you like me to pack my cat</v>

2288
01:41:09.911 --> 01:41:12.250
<v Speaker 4>correctly?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kicked me out because of that.</v>

2289
01:41:12.251 --> 01:41:13.410
<v Speaker 4>It's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of stress.</v>

2290
01:41:14.430 --> 01:41:17.380
<v Speaker 4>They hit him with a bid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're mocking someone's inability to</v>

2291
01:41:17.381 --> 01:41:21.250
<v Speaker 4>communicate correctly and it because</v>
<v Speaker 4>look whether or not it's good or bad.</v>

2292
01:41:21.251 --> 01:41:24.340
<v Speaker 4>Like you might like saying both better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You might like it and there's nothing</v>

2293
01:41:24.341 --> 01:41:25.151
<v Speaker 4>wrong with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

2294
01:41:25.151 --> 01:41:26.680
<v Speaker 4>if you're a happy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>successful person,</v>

2295
01:41:26.690 --> 01:41:29.170
<v Speaker 4>you don't like to say both.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You like to say both.</v>

2296
01:41:29.860 --> 01:41:31.120
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck is wrong with that?</v>

2297
01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:32.560
<v Speaker 4>It's just a sound you make with your</v>
<v Speaker 4>mouth.</v>

2298
01:41:32.561 --> 01:41:34.360
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if I can say it,</v>

2299
01:41:34.450 --> 01:41:37.240
<v Speaker 4>if I can repeat it and you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're so touchy about it.</v>

2300
01:41:37.420 --> 01:41:40.030
<v Speaker 4>You kicked me out of class.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We fucked up.</v>

2301
01:41:40.660 --> 01:41:42.160
<v Speaker 4>You fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got a soft spot.</v>

2302
01:41:42.220 --> 01:41:43.420
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She knows.</v>

2303
01:41:43.421 --> 01:41:44.080
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She feels,</v>

2304
01:41:44.080 --> 01:41:45.820
<v Speaker 4>she feels insecure about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

2305
01:41:45.821 --> 01:41:48.460
<v Speaker 4>How big lab on this one of my first big</v>
<v Speaker 4>laughs,</v>

2306
01:41:48.820 --> 01:41:50.440
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>

2307
01:41:50.441 --> 01:41:52.030
<v Speaker 4>I could mock things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2308
01:41:52.310 --> 01:41:53.500
<v Speaker 4>But it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2309
01:41:53.650 --> 01:41:56.080
<v Speaker 4>she just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's under pressure.</v>

2310
01:41:56.170 --> 01:41:58.630
<v Speaker 4>It's terrible job not getting paid very</v>
<v Speaker 4>much.</v>

2311
01:41:58.631 --> 01:42:01.600
<v Speaker 4>And you have to be a babysitter as well</v>
<v Speaker 4>as an educator.</v>

2312
01:42:01.650 --> 01:42:02.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking horrible.</v>

2313
01:42:03.210 --> 01:42:06.110
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had Frank Rich on my podcast on we,</v>

2314
01:42:06.111 --> 01:42:07.380
<v Speaker 3>the people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2315
01:42:07.410 --> 01:42:09.350
<v Speaker 3>who was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who he's an executive producer on the</v>

2316
01:42:09.351 --> 01:42:11.850
<v Speaker 3>vape and he was the co,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was,</v>

2317
01:42:11.860 --> 01:42:15.210
<v Speaker 3>we was like the main columnist on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>New York Times opinion page for about 50</v>

2318
01:42:15.211 --> 01:42:20.211
<v Speaker 3>from maybe almost 20 years in the 90s</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the two thousands and he sort of</v>

2319
01:42:20.311 --> 01:42:23.310
<v Speaker 3>started the New York Times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can review section,</v>

2320
01:42:23.340 --> 01:42:25.770
<v Speaker 3>which comes out in the Sunday paper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And these days.</v>

2321
01:42:26.160 --> 01:42:29.730
<v Speaker 3>And he had a piece in New York magazine</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was about how much empathy we</v>

2322
01:42:29.731 --> 01:42:33.420
<v Speaker 3>should feel towards uneducated people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was talking specifically about trump,</v>

2323
01:42:33.421 --> 01:42:36.360
<v Speaker 3>about like trump voters because like</v>
<v Speaker 3>since the election there's been quite a</v>

2324
01:42:36.361 --> 01:42:40.830
<v Speaker 3>lot of hand wringing among progressive's</v>
<v Speaker 3>about like we've been focusing too much</v>

2325
01:42:40.831 --> 01:42:44.630
<v Speaker 3>on these issues like trans rights and</v>
<v Speaker 3>gay rights and so on and,</v>

2326
01:42:44.670 --> 01:42:48.390
<v Speaker 3>and identity politics and black lives</v>
<v Speaker 3>matter and we've lost touch with the</v>

2327
01:42:48.391 --> 01:42:50.010
<v Speaker 3>working class base.</v>

2328
01:42:50.010 --> 01:42:54.570
<v Speaker 3>Like the Democratic Party no longer</v>
<v Speaker 3>speaks in a meaningful way to white</v>

2329
01:42:54.600 --> 01:42:57.840
<v Speaker 3>working class,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially males and especially in rust</v>

2330
01:42:57.841 --> 01:42:59.040
<v Speaker 3>belt cities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2331
01:42:59.041 --> 01:42:59.760
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

2332
01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:04.760
<v Speaker 3>in the Midwest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And his point was actually fuck him.</v>

2333
01:43:05.670 --> 01:43:07.410
<v Speaker 3>You shouldn't need to pay attention to</v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

2334
01:43:07.720 --> 01:43:10.590
<v Speaker 3>There were a lost cause.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They keep voting against their own</v>

2335
01:43:10.591 --> 01:43:13.260
<v Speaker 3>interest by voting for people like trump</v>
<v Speaker 3>and voting for republicans.</v>

2336
01:43:13.470 --> 01:43:17.160
<v Speaker 3>Don't try to win them over and stop</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to understand them and wringing</v>

2337
01:43:17.161 --> 01:43:21.000
<v Speaker 3>your hands about why you've lost them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an interesting episode.</v>

2338
01:43:21.001 --> 01:43:23.010
<v Speaker 3>If people want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean obviously I'm grossly</v>

2339
01:43:23.580 --> 01:43:25.590
<v Speaker 3>exaggerating what his actual position</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

2340
01:43:25.591 --> 01:43:26.520
<v Speaker 3>but you should,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can.</v>

2341
01:43:27.320 --> 01:43:28.550
<v Speaker 4>I can see it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>listen to the other side.</v>

2342
01:43:28.670 --> 01:43:30.650
<v Speaker 4>I could see how someone would take that</v>
<v Speaker 4>stance,</v>

2343
01:43:30.920 --> 01:43:33.830
<v Speaker 4>but I think there's just a natural</v>
<v Speaker 4>inclination to go left and right with</v>

2344
01:43:33.831 --> 01:43:36.590
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a natural inclination to react</v>

2345
01:43:36.591 --> 01:43:41.060
<v Speaker 4>to certain right leaning behaviors by</v>
<v Speaker 4>going far left and the natural</v>

2346
01:43:41.061 --> 01:43:46.010
<v Speaker 4>inclination to go like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like how many people grow up from really</v>

2347
01:43:46.100 --> 01:43:51.100
<v Speaker 4>a regressive religious backgrounds and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then they become like really saccular.</v>

2348
01:43:51.290 --> 01:43:53.470
<v Speaker 4>As they get older,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they abandoned the religion,</v>

2349
01:43:53.480 --> 01:43:55.820
<v Speaker 4>they become reformed Catholics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really common.</v>

2350
01:43:56.300 --> 01:44:01.300
<v Speaker 4>It's really common to to see the</v>
<v Speaker 4>suppression of one ideology and bounce</v>

2351
01:44:01.760 --> 01:44:03.470
<v Speaker 4>in the other direction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you have a parent,</v>

2352
01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:05.450
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's a lot of people that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2353
01:44:05.451 --> 01:44:07.920
<v Speaker 4>they grow up and their parents are super</v>
<v Speaker 4>hippies and then they become a</v>

2354
01:44:07.921 --> 01:44:10.130
<v Speaker 4>conservative going to rebel against</v>
<v Speaker 4>their parents.</v>

2355
01:44:10.310 --> 01:44:11.420
<v Speaker 4>It's a really common,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

2356
01:44:11.740 --> 01:44:14.440
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm always thinking about in</v>
<v Speaker 3>terms of parenthood as well.</v>

2357
01:44:14.441 --> 01:44:18.070
<v Speaker 3>Like no matter what it is that I try to</v>
<v Speaker 3>fix in the way that my parents raised</v>

2358
01:44:18.071 --> 01:44:19.240
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where I think they could've done it</v>

2359
01:44:19.241 --> 01:44:20.830
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just going to swing in the</v>

2360
01:44:20.831 --> 01:44:22.820
<v Speaker 3>opposite direction and then my kids are</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to do the opposite</v>

2361
01:44:22.870 --> 01:44:25.000
<v Speaker 4>because they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you always think that your</v>

2362
01:44:25.001 --> 01:44:27.000
<v Speaker 4>parents did an imperfect job,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2363
01:44:27.640 --> 01:44:30.100
<v Speaker 4>Fighting yesterday's [inaudible] does an</v>
<v Speaker 4>imperfect job.</v>

2364
01:44:30.101 --> 01:44:32.560
<v Speaker 4>It's impossible to be perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're a fucking human being.</v>

2365
01:44:32.561 --> 01:44:34.990
<v Speaker 4>There's no perfect human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've never existed.</v>

2366
01:44:35.020 --> 01:44:38.410
<v Speaker 4>Jesus said the sweet baby Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Dalai Lama's not perfect.</v>

2367
01:44:38.411 --> 01:44:41.680
<v Speaker 4>How about fucking Gandhi?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gandhi used to sleep with a bunch of</v>

2368
01:44:41.681 --> 01:44:44.560
<v Speaker 4>girls naked in his room.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was probably a freak,</v>

2369
01:44:44.920 --> 01:44:47.380
<v Speaker 4>like Gandhi was most likely a freak and</v>
<v Speaker 4>he just,</v>

2370
01:44:47.381 --> 01:44:49.840
<v Speaker 4>they just kept it under wraps because he</v>
<v Speaker 4>was Gandhi like,</v>

2371
01:44:49.841 --> 01:44:51.880
<v Speaker 4>do you know the story?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Used to sleep with naked teenagers.</v>

2372
01:44:51.910 --> 01:44:54.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's also weird things about,</v>

2373
01:44:54.280 --> 01:44:58.060
<v Speaker 3>I mean human and also Mother Teresa have</v>
<v Speaker 3>weird things in their personal lives do</v>

2374
01:44:58.600 --> 01:44:59.830
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it was sexual,</v>

2375
01:44:59.831 --> 01:45:02.040
<v Speaker 3>but I think there was a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were a lot of questions about like</v>

2376
01:45:02.050 --> 01:45:05.320
<v Speaker 3>her ethical dealings in terms of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mother Teresa Foundation and where her</v>

2377
01:45:05.321 --> 01:45:08.590
<v Speaker 3>money went.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like what did it go too well for his</v>

2378
01:45:08.591 --> 01:45:10.270
<v Speaker 3>thought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She didn't think that it was very,</v>

2379
01:45:10.340 --> 01:45:14.050
<v Speaker 3>she didn't think it was a good idea to</v>
<v Speaker 3>empower young women.</v>

2380
01:45:14.280 --> 01:45:16.440
<v Speaker 4>What have you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>W We found out that all our money went</v>

2381
01:45:16.441 --> 01:45:20.580
<v Speaker 4>to a warehouse filled with dildos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why thought fuck.</v>

2382
01:45:20.790 --> 01:45:23.990
<v Speaker 4>Like she did a lot of good but she also</v>
<v Speaker 4>bought a lot of Dildos,</v>

2383
01:45:24.330 --> 01:45:27.540
<v Speaker 4>fucking gigantic stacks of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh wait,</v>

2384
01:45:28.170 --> 01:45:33.170
<v Speaker 4>she could use the door kick start these</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking Harley Davidson powered</v>

2385
01:45:33.901 --> 01:45:35.760
<v Speaker 4>vibrators.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love it.</v>

2386
01:45:36.330 --> 01:45:39.440
<v Speaker 4>Uh Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well I mean the people are not perfect</v>

2387
01:45:39.441 --> 01:45:43.950
<v Speaker 4>and most charitable organizations are</v>
<v Speaker 4>criticized for spending far too much on</v>

2388
01:45:44.340 --> 01:45:47.940
<v Speaker 4>infrastructure and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the administrative costs and then you</v>

2389
01:45:47.941 --> 01:45:49.740
<v Speaker 4>find out how much money actually goes to</v>
<v Speaker 4>the charity.</v>

2390
01:45:49.741 --> 01:45:53.760
<v Speaker 4>Like you just have an organization where</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're giving people jobs and by the way</v>

2391
01:45:53.761 --> 01:45:55.230
<v Speaker 4>you also do some good.</v>

2392
01:45:55.640 --> 01:45:56.473
<v Speaker 3>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>

2393
01:45:56.780 --> 01:45:58.940
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting cause like whenever I</v>
<v Speaker 3>give to charity,</v>

2394
01:45:58.941 --> 01:46:00.560
<v Speaker 3>I always try to pay attention to how</v>
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>

2395
01:46:00.561 --> 01:46:03.770
<v Speaker 3>how many overheads they have and how</v>
<v Speaker 3>much money is being spent on Admin and</v>

2396
01:46:03.771 --> 01:46:06.770
<v Speaker 3>so on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then it was actually I think will</v>

2397
01:46:06.771 --> 01:46:09.410
<v Speaker 3>macaskill or someone who's involved in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the um,</v>

2398
01:46:09.650 --> 01:46:12.230
<v Speaker 3>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the life you can save kind of like give</v>

2399
01:46:12.240 --> 01:46:14.660
<v Speaker 3>well movement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is like rational.</v>

2400
01:46:14.740 --> 01:46:18.230
<v Speaker 3>Is it practical altruism or rational</v>
<v Speaker 3>altruism with effective altruism?</v>

2401
01:46:18.231 --> 01:46:19.200
<v Speaker 3>That's how podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2402
01:46:19.970 --> 01:46:20.803
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's great.</v>

2403
01:46:21.170 --> 01:46:24.380
<v Speaker 3>He was an,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they were saying in actual fact it</v>

2404
01:46:24.381 --> 01:46:28.310
<v Speaker 3>does take quite a lot of administration</v>
<v Speaker 3>to make a dollar work.</v>

2405
01:46:28.311 --> 01:46:31.520
<v Speaker 3>Well of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you just look at the ones at the</v>

2406
01:46:31.550 --> 01:46:34.760
<v Speaker 3>charities with the lowest overhead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then that it doesn't necessarily</v>

2407
01:46:34.761 --> 01:46:37.220
<v Speaker 3>actually mean that they're doing the</v>
<v Speaker 3>best work in the field because it might</v>

2408
01:46:37.221 --> 01:46:40.430
<v Speaker 3>cost 40 cents out of every dollar to</v>
<v Speaker 3>make sure that you're targeting the</v>

2409
01:46:40.431 --> 01:46:44.700
<v Speaker 3>remaining 60 cents in a way where you'll</v>
<v Speaker 3>get actually 60 cents of value rather</v>

2410
01:46:44.710 --> 01:46:46.820
<v Speaker 3>than a place that only has a 15%</v>
<v Speaker 3>overhead.</v>

2411
01:46:47.060 --> 01:46:50.190
<v Speaker 3>But then the remaining 85 cents are all</v>
<v Speaker 3>being on bullshit projects</v>

2412
01:46:50.190 --> 01:46:52.480
<v Speaker 5>that don't have any measurable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then success.</v>

2413
01:46:52.481 --> 01:46:54.480
<v Speaker 5>It's signed the complete other end of</v>
<v Speaker 5>the spectrum.</v>

2414
01:46:54.481 --> 01:46:57.420
<v Speaker 5>You have the Clinton Foundation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which was a ruse.</v>

2415
01:46:58.170 --> 01:47:00.630
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was not essentially a prestige play</v>

2416
01:47:00.631 --> 01:47:02.040
<v Speaker 5>wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't exist anymore.</v>

2417
01:47:02.670 --> 01:47:04.530
<v Speaker 5>Does not exist any going under.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2418
01:47:04.560 --> 01:47:06.030
<v Speaker 5>they're closing it down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hmm.</v>

2419
01:47:06.060 --> 01:47:07.890
<v Speaker 5>Isn't that a fact?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pull up police pull that up.</v>

2420
01:47:07.980 --> 01:47:09.780
<v Speaker 5>I'm pretty sure they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they said they were shutting it down,</v>

2421
01:47:10.200 --> 01:47:15.200
<v Speaker 5>but I mean Bill Clinton would take</v>
<v Speaker 5>hundreds of thousands of dollars and</v>

2422
01:47:15.451 --> 01:47:18.050
<v Speaker 5>speak at these charitable events.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like people would jet,</v>

2423
01:47:18.060 --> 01:47:21.840
<v Speaker 5>they would spend a gigantic chunk of</v>
<v Speaker 5>their budget to have Bill Clinton come</v>

2424
01:47:21.841 --> 01:47:24.690
<v Speaker 5>and speak and he would take all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He would take all the money.</v>

2425
01:47:24.691 --> 01:47:26.740
<v Speaker 5>He wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we didn't think of it fast.</v>

2426
01:47:26.950 --> 01:47:28.320
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he would,</v>

2427
01:47:28.500 --> 01:47:33.500
<v Speaker 5>he would take these gigantic donations</v>
<v Speaker 5>from people and then he would speak and</v>

2428
01:47:34.770 --> 01:47:38.580
<v Speaker 5>get paid hundreds of thousand dollars</v>
<v Speaker 5>speaking phase of crazy.</v>

2429
01:47:38.581 --> 01:47:40.230
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even the fact that Hillary Clinton was</v>

2430
01:47:40.231 --> 01:47:45.000
<v Speaker 5>taking speaking fees from Goldman Sachs</v>
<v Speaker 5>and did not think that that would look</v>

2431
01:47:45.001 --> 01:47:47.660
<v Speaker 5>bad in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she didn't give a fuck.</v>

2432
01:47:47.660 --> 01:47:48.510
<v Speaker 5>So stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2433
01:47:48.511 --> 01:47:48.751
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2434
01:47:48.751 --> 01:47:50.520
<v Speaker 5>I think now she gives a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2435
01:47:50.521 --> 01:47:53.160
<v Speaker 5>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bernie Sanders drilled that and I'm so</v>

2436
01:47:53.161 --> 01:47:55.560
<v Speaker 5>glad he did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But look,</v>

2437
01:47:56.310 --> 01:47:58.530
<v Speaker 5>it's bribery.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a loophole.</v>

2438
01:47:58.680 --> 01:48:01.890
<v Speaker 5>There's a little bowl and it's bribery.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nobody wants to pay to hear her talk.</v>

2439
01:48:01.891 --> 01:48:03.780
<v Speaker 5>Get the fuck out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's a terrible speaker.</v>

2440
01:48:04.560 --> 01:48:07.050
<v Speaker 5>She's not Louis C k.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I'm saying?</v>

2441
01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:08.430
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is not Chris Rock.</v>

2442
01:48:08.431 --> 01:48:10.890
<v Speaker 5>We're talking about this is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's not a good speaker,</v>

2443
01:48:10.910 --> 01:48:13.910
<v Speaker 5>but the whole painted here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is the whole thing about these I,</v>

2444
01:48:13.911 --> 01:48:17.520
<v Speaker 5>late Clinton global initiative to</v>
<v Speaker 5>shutdown lays off 22 as donations,</v>

2445
01:48:17.760 --> 01:48:19.400
<v Speaker 5>but this is the Washington Times.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a,</v>

2446
01:48:19.410 --> 01:48:20.590
<v Speaker 5>that's a no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2447
01:48:20.591 --> 01:48:21.620
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right wing rag.</v>

2448
01:48:21.621 --> 01:48:23.100
<v Speaker 5>How dare you check.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2449
01:48:23.220 --> 01:48:25.560
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's not the only place that I saw it.</v>

2450
01:48:25.590 --> 01:48:28.030
<v Speaker 5>I saw it in a lot of places.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're shutting it down at the top.</v>

2451
01:48:28.060 --> 01:48:30.460
<v Speaker 5>The top click is snipes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that'll tell level.</v>

2452
01:48:30.510 --> 01:48:34.200
<v Speaker 5>That's the conspiracy theory of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>whole story about snopes though.</v>

2453
01:48:34.260 --> 01:48:35.910
<v Speaker 5>Do you know about the guy who runs</v>
<v Speaker 5>snopes?</v>

2454
01:48:37.620 --> 01:48:40.500
<v Speaker 5>Snopes is run by a fucking Kook.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Guy,</v>

2455
01:48:40.530 --> 01:48:43.800
<v Speaker 5>the guy who runs snopes left his wife,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he started with his wife,</v>

2456
01:48:43.801 --> 01:48:45.630
<v Speaker 5>left his wife,</v>
<v Speaker 5>married a prostitute,</v>

2457
01:48:46.070 --> 01:48:49.680
<v Speaker 5>a prostitute as a website where she was</v>
<v Speaker 5>as recently as two years ago,</v>

2458
01:48:49.681 --> 01:48:52.020
<v Speaker 5>was getting reviewed for her prostitute</v>
<v Speaker 5>work.</v>

2459
01:48:52.320 --> 01:48:57.320
<v Speaker 5>She's asked court and there they both</v>
<v Speaker 5>have a clear left wing bias clear like,</v>

2460
01:48:57.840 --> 01:48:59.850
<v Speaker 5>like he's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's been involved in,</v>

2461
01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:00.833
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean show me,</v>

2462
01:49:02.730 --> 01:49:05.430
<v Speaker 5>show me any snips,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pages that say that something is true</v>

2463
01:49:05.431 --> 01:49:10.110
<v Speaker 5>when it's not or the sites.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not necessarily that it's true or it's</v>

2464
01:49:10.111 --> 01:49:13.770
<v Speaker 5>false.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's these ambiguous areas where they</v>

2465
01:49:13.771 --> 01:49:16.890
<v Speaker 5>always lean left and that's what people</v>
<v Speaker 5>have said about snopes.</v>

2466
01:49:16.891 --> 01:49:17.724
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of tricky.</v>

2467
01:49:17.750 --> 01:49:18.930
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's not,</v>

2468
01:49:18.931 --> 01:49:19.651
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's simple.</v>

2469
01:49:19.651 --> 01:49:24.651
<v Speaker 5>It's not like this computer controlled</v>
<v Speaker 5>objective reality and understand Isley.</v>

2470
01:49:25.570 --> 01:49:28.560
<v Speaker 5>Politifact is also,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it also gets accused of being left wing</v>

2471
01:49:28.561 --> 01:49:31.590
<v Speaker 5>because right wing people who are full</v>
<v Speaker 5>of shit don't like being cold out on it.</v>

2472
01:49:31.620 --> 01:49:32.670
<v Speaker 5>Fake News.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2473
01:49:32.700 --> 01:49:33.361
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not,</v>

2474
01:49:33.361 --> 01:49:34.760
<v Speaker 5>it's not actually,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I've,</v>

2475

<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2476
01:49:36.660 --> 01:49:38.680
<v Speaker 5>that is questionable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even if the guy's an asshole,</v>

2477
01:49:39.040 --> 01:49:42.240
<v Speaker 5>this CNN thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when she pointed to the CNN reporter,</v>

2494
01:50:30.700 --> 01:50:34.210
<v Speaker 3>He would be elected by very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very narrow majorities in a few key</v>

2495
01:50:34.211 --> 01:50:39.010

<v Speaker 3>expos.</v>

2498
01:50:47.041 --> 01:50:51.550
<v Speaker 3>A's is about how Hillary Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how the FBI prosecutor who was looking</v>

2499
01:50:51.551 --> 01:50:54.820
<v Speaker 3>into Hillary Clinton had been found dead</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all this sort of stuff.</v>

2500
01:50:54.821 --> 01:50:58.600
<v Speaker 3>There was actually fake news then the</v>
<v Speaker 3>way the term came into public public</v>

2501
01:50:58.601 --> 01:51:02.980
<v Speaker 3>consciousness last year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now anyone who criticizes the</v>

2502
01:51:02.981 --> 01:51:05.230
<v Speaker 3>administration,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just does.</v>

2503
01:51:05.231 --> 01:51:06.640
<v Speaker 3>He just pulls a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you are,</v>

2504
01:51:06.641 --> 01:51:08.620
<v Speaker 3>you said you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what am I a trick and says,</v>

2505
01:51:08.621 --> 01:51:09.970
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not fake news.</v>

2506
01:51:09.971 --> 01:51:12.400
<v Speaker 3>Your fake news you face is fake news.</v>

2507
01:51:15.210 --> 01:51:18.230
<v Speaker 4>What did you think about when Julian</v>
<v Speaker 4>assange,</v>

2508
01:51:18.530 --> 01:51:22.440
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>implied that that young man who worked</v>

2509
01:51:22.441 --> 01:51:24.540
<v Speaker 4>for the DNC,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who was assassinated,</v>

2510
01:51:25.010 --> 01:51:27.750
<v Speaker 4>he was shot in the back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They tried to say it was a robbery.</v>

2511
01:51:27.780 --> 01:51:30.160
<v Speaker 4>Like they left his wallet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they left his watch,</v>

2512
01:51:30.161 --> 01:51:31.860
<v Speaker 4>they left his phone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'd left all his money.</v>

2513
01:51:32.200 --> 01:51:34.230
<v Speaker 4>That didn't take a thing from him and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they shot him at four o'clock in the</v>

2514
01:51:34.231 --> 01:51:37.470
<v Speaker 4>morning in the back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Julian assange was insinuating that this</v>

2515
01:51:37.471 --> 01:51:41.730
<v Speaker 4>young man had been the source of the DNC</v>
<v Speaker 4>leaks.</v>

2516
01:51:41.880 --> 01:51:45.120
<v Speaker 4>That implied that though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that show that Hillary Clinton and the</v>

2517
01:51:45.121 --> 01:51:48.090
<v Speaker 4>DNC conspired against Bernie Sanders in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the primary,</v>

2518
01:51:48.630 --> 01:51:50.670
<v Speaker 4>and you don't really hear about that</v>
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>

2519
01:51:50.671 --> 01:51:51.690
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that guy's dead.</v>

2520
01:51:51.750 --> 01:51:53.880
<v Speaker 4>He's dead and there's no investigation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no,</v>

2521
01:51:53.910 --> 01:51:56.370
<v Speaker 4>no one was found guilty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one was tried.</v>

2522
01:51:56.371 --> 01:51:57.480
<v Speaker 4>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no,</v>

2523
01:51:57.510 --> 01:51:59.250
<v Speaker 4>no one's looking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That guy was killed.</v>

2524
01:51:59.420 --> 01:52:00.440
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to look into it.</v>

2525
01:52:00.441 --> 01:52:04.220
<v Speaker 3>I think [inaudible] has kind of lost</v>
<v Speaker 3>credibility by essentially becoming a</v>

2526
01:52:04.221 --> 01:52:07.880
<v Speaker 3>conduit for the Kremlin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like all of know wikileaks,</v>

2527
01:52:08.030 --> 01:52:10.540
<v Speaker 3>we all know that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean people insecurity.</v>

2528
01:52:10.550 --> 01:52:12.170
<v Speaker 3>So every,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anytime I talk about this,</v>

2529
01:52:12.171 --> 01:52:13.760
<v Speaker 3>people are going to respond and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2530
01:52:13.761 --> 01:52:15.330
<v Speaker 3>you're just buying the security</v>
<v Speaker 3>services.</v>

2531
01:52:15.340 --> 01:52:18.260
<v Speaker 3>Align years believing what the NSA and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the CIA want you to believe.</v>

2532
01:52:18.800 --> 01:52:19.610
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2533
01:52:19.610 --> 01:52:24.610
<v Speaker 3>I'm basically taking on faith the</v>
<v Speaker 3>conclusions of security agencies here in</v>

2534
01:52:24.621 --> 01:52:27.170
<v Speaker 3>the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 3>multiple to get more than a dozen</v>

2535
01:52:27.171 --> 01:52:30.530
<v Speaker 3>different security agencies also</v>
<v Speaker 3>confirmed by the Brits,</v>

2536
01:52:30.531 --> 01:52:33.800
<v Speaker 3>by British,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the British secret service all believe</v>

2537
01:52:33.890 --> 01:52:37.640
<v Speaker 3>say that they have good reason to</v>
<v Speaker 3>believe that the Kremlin was behind the</v>

2538
01:52:37.641 --> 01:52:42.020
<v Speaker 3>hacks and that wikileaks released was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it must've been in cahoots with the</v>

2539
01:52:42.021 --> 01:52:45.330
<v Speaker 3>Kremlin because otherwise how it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how did they release the DNC was there</v>

2540
01:52:45.331 --> 01:52:46.010
<v Speaker 3>could have been</v>

2541
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:50.910
<v Speaker 5>many people that were trying to have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but dealing with like can see</v>

2542
01:52:50.911 --> 01:52:53.240
<v Speaker 5>fingerprints on things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They know how these things work.</v>

2543
01:52:53.241 --> 01:52:56.270
<v Speaker 5>They can see the back doors.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So do you think that Julian assange was</v>

2544
01:52:56.271 --> 01:52:58.490
<v Speaker 5>lying and saying that guy was a part of</v>
<v Speaker 5>the leaks?</v>

2545
01:52:59.630 --> 01:53:01.490
<v Speaker 5>I think could have been one of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>conduits.</v>

2546
01:53:01.540 --> 01:53:02.840
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he could have been one of the people</v>

2547
01:53:02.841 --> 01:53:04.880
<v Speaker 5>that leaked it to Russia in the first</v>
<v Speaker 5>place.</v>

2548
01:53:05.950 --> 01:53:07.010
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's possible.</v>

2549
01:53:07.160 --> 01:53:08.210
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's possible.</v>

2550
01:53:08.300 --> 01:53:11.330
<v Speaker 5>I just don't know why I would be</v>
<v Speaker 5>trusting Julian assange about any of</v>

2551
01:53:11.331 --> 01:53:13.010
<v Speaker 5>this because he says that it didn't come</v>
<v Speaker 5>from Russia.</v>

2552
01:53:13.400 --> 01:53:14.990
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the other thing that I would worry about</v>

2553
01:53:14.991 --> 01:53:18.350
<v Speaker 5>with Julian Assan,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's at this poor fuck has been trapped</v>

2554
01:53:18.351 --> 01:53:22.370
<v Speaker 5>in the embassy in London for so long and</v>
<v Speaker 5>he can't get out.</v>

2555
01:53:22.550 --> 01:53:24.230
<v Speaker 5>I think his head is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think he'd be,</v>

2556
01:53:24.240 --> 01:53:25.800
<v Speaker 5>he's got a problem with his head these</v>
<v Speaker 5>days.</v>

2557
01:53:26.330 --> 01:53:30.650
<v Speaker 5>How could he not Pammie's back?</v>

01:54:42.920 --> 01:54:45.350

<v Speaker 5>reverse that.</v>

2584
01:54:45.410 --> 01:54:47.420
<v Speaker 5>It's on the way 100%.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They've already done it.</v>

2585
01:54:47.470 --> 01:54:51.230
<v Speaker 5>And what people would pay to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 5>look and feel like they did when they</v>

2586
01:54:51.231 --> 01:54:53.440
<v Speaker 5>were 25 well,</v>

2589
01:54:57.081 --> 01:54:59.990
<v Speaker 5>Him and Julie and a son should,</v>
<v Speaker 5>should meet up and create some little</v>

01:54:59.991 --> 01:55:01.550
<v Speaker 5>underground implants and trust him.</v>

2592
01:55:04.850 --> 01:55:06.830

<v Speaker 5>bad,</v>

<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2597
01:55:14.001 --> 01:55:17.330
<v Speaker 5>suing Golkar until it went under.</v>

2598
01:55:17.331 --> 01:55:21.080
<v Speaker 5>he's a violative prick.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well they had a common,</v>

2599
01:55:21.110 --> 01:55:24.530
<v Speaker 5>I mean they outdid him and then they</v>
<v Speaker 5>went after Hulk Hogan and then the guy</v>

2600
01:55:24.531 --> 01:55:27.890
<v Speaker 5>said that he would release a sex tape of</v>
<v Speaker 5>a child,</v>

2601
01:55:28.220 --> 01:55:29.600
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if he could get away with it.</v>

2604
01:55:31.690 --> 01:55:34.550
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't condone them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I don't like setting up a precedent</v>

2605
01:55:34.551 --> 01:55:36.050
<v Speaker 5>where very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very rich people can just,</v>

2606
01:55:36.051 --> 01:55:38.390
<v Speaker 5>cause this wasn't the only thing that he</v>
<v Speaker 5>was suing them about.</v>

2607
01:55:38.391 --> 01:55:40.740
<v Speaker 5>He was basically just throwing lawsuits</v>
<v Speaker 5>at them that,</v>

2608
01:55:40.741 --> 01:55:42.680
<v Speaker 5>that so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so fast that they couldn't keep their</v>

2609
01:55:42.681 --> 01:55:43.910
<v Speaker 5>head above and</v>

2610
01:55:44.120 --> 01:55:45.600
<v Speaker 1>they went down to our biggest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2611
01:55:45.601 --> 01:55:48.450
<v Speaker 1>how can you eventually the person's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to win a lawsuit.</v>

2612
01:55:48.451 --> 01:55:52.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't like the idea that media</v>
<v Speaker 1>companies can just be constantly sued.</v>

2613
01:55:52.170 --> 01:55:54.450
<v Speaker 1>They went after a creep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2614
01:55:54.540 --> 01:55:56.580
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were creeps and they went after</v>

2615
01:55:56.581 --> 01:55:57.870
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they went after a rich guy.</v>

2616
01:55:58.290 --> 01:55:58.761
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2617
01:55:58.761 --> 01:56:00.120
<v Speaker 1>we live in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we live in America,</v>

2618
01:56:00.121 --> 01:56:02.370
<v Speaker 1>which has a first amendment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're supposed to be able to do that</v>

2619
01:56:02.371 --> 01:56:03.750
<v Speaker 1>without,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without being sunk.</v>

2620
01:56:04.230 --> 01:56:08.340
<v Speaker 1>But should they be able to reveal</v>
<v Speaker 1>details about his life that he doesn't</v>

2621
01:56:08.341 --> 01:56:10.440
<v Speaker 1>want public?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's let the First Amendment is,</v>

2622
01:56:10.441 --> 01:56:13.500
<v Speaker 1>you're allowed to a set of first</v>
<v Speaker 1>amendment that you're allowed to go</v>

2623
01:56:13.501 --> 01:56:15.810
<v Speaker 1>after.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone like say if somebody decides to</v>

2624
01:56:15.811 --> 01:56:18.360
<v Speaker 1>just go after you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not even a public person.</v>

2625
01:56:18.650 --> 01:56:20.610
<v Speaker 1>Like keep me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is he probably as a public person,</v>

2626
01:56:20.640 --> 01:56:22.350
<v Speaker 1>how has he public,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because people know who he is.</v>

2627
01:56:22.950 --> 01:56:24.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't actually know whether that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the,</v>

2628
01:56:24.571 --> 01:56:27.720
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the defense is crazy shit about</v>

2629
01:56:27.721 --> 01:56:29.160
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately.</v>

2630
01:56:29.161 --> 01:56:31.680
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that's what freedom is.</v>

2631
01:56:31.681 --> 01:56:33.000
<v Speaker 1>Like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that,</v>

2632
01:56:33.120 --> 01:56:36.510
<v Speaker 1>do you think that America would be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>better place if fantastically wealthy</v>

2633
01:56:36.511 --> 01:56:38.170
<v Speaker 1>people could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2634
01:56:38.280 --> 01:56:42.960
<v Speaker 1>launch an endless string of lawsuits?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether or not they're legitimate at</v>

2635
01:56:42.961 --> 01:56:45.720
<v Speaker 1>media companies that aren't like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a good question.</v>

2636
01:56:46.080 --> 01:56:50.460
<v Speaker 1>It really depends on what that media</v>
<v Speaker 1>company did and why they did it.</v>

2637
01:56:51.120 --> 01:56:53.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm no fan of gawkers tawdry like I</v>

2638
01:56:53.941 --> 01:56:55.720
<v Speaker 1>didn't consume any of that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2639
01:56:55.721 --> 01:56:59.940
<v Speaker 1>I didn't believe in adding paypal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that they were right.</v>

2640
01:56:59.941 --> 01:57:04.590
<v Speaker 1>But what it says about his character is</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I find troubling it much like</v>

2641
01:57:04.591 --> 01:57:05.311
<v Speaker 1>trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't,</v>

2642
01:57:05.311 --> 01:57:09.090
<v Speaker 1>I basically don't like vindictive people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who the moment you cross them,</v>

2643
01:57:09.091 --> 01:57:13.560
<v Speaker 1>they then spend the rest of their lives</v>
<v Speaker 1>and fortune like coming back to hunt you</v>

2644
01:57:13.561 --> 01:57:13.860
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

2645
01:57:13.860 --> 01:57:15.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's a mature character</v>
<v Speaker 1>trait.</v>

2646
01:57:15.750 --> 01:57:17.820
<v Speaker 1>I see your point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see your point.</v>

2647
01:57:18.120 --> 01:57:21.600
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the question would be what if they cost</v>

2648
01:57:21.601 --> 01:57:26.210
<v Speaker 1>him money and they profited from it</v>
<v Speaker 1>financially and then he will not leave.</v>

2649
01:57:26.500 --> 01:57:28.080
<v Speaker 1>Cry me a fucking Ribeye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He comes,</v>

2650
01:57:28.081 --> 01:57:31.650
<v Speaker 1>not the best example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the best example because you</v>

2651
01:57:31.651 --> 01:57:32.960
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing wrong with being gay.</v>

2652
01:57:32.961 --> 01:57:34.230
<v Speaker 1>She had just been out in the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

2653
01:57:34.250 --> 01:57:35.700
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's his choice,</v>

2654
01:57:35.701 --> 01:57:36.960
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2655
01:57:36.961 --> 01:57:38.760
<v Speaker 1>it is his choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't really believe in adding</v>

2656
01:57:38.761 --> 01:57:39.990
<v Speaker 1>paypal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but on the other hand,</v>

2657
01:57:39.991 --> 01:57:43.380
<v Speaker 1>like just grow up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I shoot them over that and he just</v>

2658
01:57:43.381 --> 01:57:45.930
<v Speaker 1>decided that they were constant who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>got to go out and get sued them about</v>

2659
01:57:45.931 --> 01:57:46.890
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that didn't work.</v>

2660
01:57:46.891 --> 01:57:49.800
<v Speaker 1>And then he sued him about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he sued them on multiple occasions.</v>

2661
01:57:49.801 --> 01:57:52.440
<v Speaker 1>If you've got infinitely deep pockets</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can ruin,</v>

2662
01:57:52.470 --> 01:57:55.830
<v Speaker 1>you will find a way to ruin people by</v>
<v Speaker 1>dragging them through the quotes.</v>

2663
01:57:56.640 --> 01:58:00.510
<v Speaker 1>She should have been able to bank roll</v>
<v Speaker 1>hall Cogan did you think Hulk Hogan had</v>

2664
01:58:00.511 --> 01:58:03.030
<v Speaker 1>a legitimate gripe?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2665
01:58:03.031 --> 01:58:04.110
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2666
01:58:04.140 --> 01:58:06.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean cause wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't that the case that he didn't</v>

2667
01:58:06.181 --> 01:58:08.250
<v Speaker 1>realize that he was being 100% of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

2668
01:58:08.580 --> 01:58:10.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't be able to have a video of</v>

2669
01:58:10.351 --> 01:58:13.800
<v Speaker 1>you having sex with somebody that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't know it was being taken splashed</v>

2670
01:58:13.801 --> 01:58:15.170
<v Speaker 1>all over the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2671
01:58:15.180 --> 01:58:17.100
<v Speaker 1>And then profit from it and then profit</v>
<v Speaker 1>from it.</v>

2672
01:58:17.220 --> 01:58:20.490
<v Speaker 1>So the real question was should he have</v>
<v Speaker 1>been able to bankroll exactly.</v>

2673
01:58:20.670 --> 01:58:21.630
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2674
01:58:21.660 --> 01:58:26.570
<v Speaker 1>Or or or should they be some limit to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the number of like lawsuits because</v>

2675
01:58:26.580 --> 01:58:27.810
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would want people to be able to</v>

2676
01:58:27.811 --> 01:58:32.070
<v Speaker 1>bankroll cases that they care about</v>
<v Speaker 1>deeply but maybe not three or four</v>

2677
01:58:32.071 --> 01:58:35.580
<v Speaker 1>completely unrelated cases all against</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same side.</v>

2678
01:58:35.581 --> 01:58:36.810
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where it gets weird.</v>

2679
01:58:36.811 --> 01:58:39.990
<v Speaker 1>But isn't this the like life in general?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2680
01:58:40.020 --> 01:58:41.160
<v Speaker 1>it's slippery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2681
01:58:41.200 --> 01:58:42.070
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

2682
01:58:42.070 --> 01:58:43.660
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's like we were talking about</v>
<v Speaker 3>with abortion,</v>

2683
01:58:43.870 --> 01:58:46.630
<v Speaker 3>like what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it killing a baby or is it a medical</v>

2684
01:58:46.631 --> 01:58:49.630
<v Speaker 3>procedure?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just agree that it's both that like</v>

2685
01:58:49.631 --> 01:58:51.820
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not to send why there is,</v>

2686
01:58:52.030 --> 01:58:54.280
<v Speaker 3>especially in this country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's so,</v>

2687
01:58:54.880 --> 01:58:59.880
<v Speaker 3>so polarizing here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh come on man.</v>

2688
01:59:00.070 --> 01:59:04.360
<v Speaker 3>I ain't know Dawson Dawkins and tweeted</v>
<v Speaker 3>something about it that there was</v>

2689
01:59:04.361 --> 01:59:09.361
<v Speaker 3>nothing that people like a human embryo</v>
<v Speaker 3>was a essentially the same thing as a</v>

2690
01:59:10.271 --> 01:59:14.180
<v Speaker 3>pig embryo was like ridiculous</v>
<v Speaker 3>comparison to abortion looks like</v>

2691
01:59:14.310 --> 01:59:18.100
<v Speaker 3>because the religious right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll always be crazy about the things</v>

2692
01:59:18.101 --> 01:59:22.510
<v Speaker 3>that it's crazy about and people will</v>
<v Speaker 3>always get offended on twitter when</v>

2693
01:59:22.511 --> 01:59:24.610
<v Speaker 3>Richard Dawkins tweet something that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>unpopular.</v>

2694
01:59:24.640 --> 01:59:27.160
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have an interview with him coming up.</v>

2695
01:59:27.180 --> 01:59:28.300
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if so if you don't,</v>

2696
01:59:28.360 --> 01:59:30.480
<v Speaker 3>let me just plug,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't subscribe to way that</v>

2697
01:59:30.490 --> 01:59:34.270
<v Speaker 3>people live in search for we the people,</v>

<v Speaker 3>weeks.</v>

<v Speaker 3>it immediately like you did last time</v>

2701

<v Speaker 3>twitter and we'll have some not to shout</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we'll have some good and that's</v>

2702
01:59:44.560 --> 01:59:46.330
<v Speaker 3>exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>

2703
01:59:46.331 --> 01:59:48.340
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to sue their asses and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>drag him through course.</v>

2704
01:59:48.670 --> 01:59:50.560
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'll be talking to joe about the be</v>

2706
01:59:51.521 --> 01:59:53.650
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ask me anything kind of dominates.</v>

2707
01:59:53.940 --> 01:59:56.780
<v Speaker 3>And so I had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did an [inaudible] with Dawkins had a</v>

2708
01:59:56.790 --> 01:59:57.490
<v Speaker 3>stroke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stroke.</v>

2709
01:59:57.490 --> 01:59:58.600
<v Speaker 3>He's great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's fine,</v>

2710
01:59:58.601 --> 01:59:59.560
<v Speaker 3>he's doing well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2711
01:59:59.561 --> 02:00:03.100
<v Speaker 3>the stroke did not affect his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his cognitive function.</v>

2712
02:00:03.250 --> 02:00:05.560
<v Speaker 3>It did affect his ability to sing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is interesting.</v>

2713
02:00:05.590 --> 02:00:06.460
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's interesting.</v>

2714
02:00:07.210 --> 02:00:07.891
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>

2715
02:00:07.891 --> 02:00:10.420
<v Speaker 3>so there are a few motor functions that</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's affected,</v>

2716
02:00:10.421 --> 02:00:11.310
<v Speaker 3>but it didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2717
02:00:11.320 --> 02:00:12.640
<v Speaker 3>as you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it didn't affect his cognitive,</v>

2718
02:00:12.641 --> 02:00:14.480
<v Speaker 3>so that'll be being released.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2719
02:00:14.620 --> 02:00:19.620
<v Speaker 3>so follow at WTP underscore live on</v>
<v Speaker 3>twitter and on the school they'll find</v>

2720
02:00:20.351 --> 02:00:20.710
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2721
02:00:20.710 --> 02:00:22.630
<v Speaker 3>Just find a way with paypal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

2722
02:00:22.631 --> 02:00:26.740
<v Speaker 3>so what Richard Dawkins was saying and</v>
<v Speaker 3>his people are going to be angry at him</v>

2723
02:00:26.741 --> 02:00:31.390
<v Speaker 3>on twitter regardless of what he says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I still affirm that in the state</v>

2724
02:00:31.391 --> 02:00:34.090
<v Speaker 3>it's in the states,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the conversation around abortion is</v>

2725
02:00:34.360 --> 02:00:38.350
<v Speaker 3>uniquely different from the way that it</v>
<v Speaker 3>is in Europe and in Australia.</v>

2726
02:00:38.740 --> 02:00:42.880
<v Speaker 3>It's much more of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just much more of a full pipeline</v>

2727
02:00:42.881 --> 02:00:47.881
<v Speaker 3>issue and I wonder whether in hindsight</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wouldn't have been better for row the</v>

2728
02:00:47.981 --> 02:00:51.400
<v Speaker 3>way not to actually have been decided by</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Supreme Court that way.</v>

2729
02:00:51.550 --> 02:00:52.390
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2730
02:00:52.391 --> 02:00:54.580
<v Speaker 3>just because I know people are going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>have,</v>

2731
02:00:54.581 --> 02:00:57.760
<v Speaker 3>you don't have this as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You fucking CIS gender piece of Shit.</v>

2732
02:00:57.820 --> 02:01:00.460
<v Speaker 3>I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe in what their surrogate mom</v>

2733
02:01:00.480 --> 02:01:04.720
<v Speaker 3>leave and abortion rights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't believe that it's that you</v>

2734
02:01:04.721 --> 02:01:09.721
<v Speaker 3>can find in the constitution of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>United States a right so inalienable</v>

2735
02:01:10.720 --> 02:01:13.030
<v Speaker 3>that the Supreme Court,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like where is it in the constitution.</v>

2736
02:01:13.060 --> 02:01:15.520
<v Speaker 3>The Supreme Court said there's a right</v>
<v Speaker 3>to privacy,</v>

2737
02:01:15.940 --> 02:01:20.940
<v Speaker 3>therefore there's a right to abortion</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we don't want to interfere in</v>

2738
02:01:21.250 --> 02:01:25.840
<v Speaker 3>women's affairs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that presupposes that the embryo</v>

2739
02:01:25.841 --> 02:01:29.560
<v Speaker 3>isn't a human,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have the right to privacy to</v>

2740
02:01:29.561 --> 02:01:31.420
<v Speaker 3>kill somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2741
02:01:31.421 --> 02:01:32.770
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I go into a room,</v>

2742
02:01:33.160 --> 02:01:36.670
<v Speaker 3>my right to privacy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't extend to me get being able</v>

2743
02:01:36.671 --> 02:01:39.680
<v Speaker 3>to get away with killing a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The question of whether or not it's a</v>

2744
02:01:39.681 --> 02:01:41.390
<v Speaker 3>baby is the relevant question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2745
02:01:41.391 --> 02:01:43.340
<v Speaker 3>That's not addressed at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2746
02:01:43.390 --> 02:01:44.270
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in row.</v>

2747
02:01:44.660 --> 02:01:47.870
<v Speaker 3>So I think that it should be legal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think that it should be legal</v>

2748
02:01:48.140 --> 02:01:51.770
<v Speaker 3>through the legislative process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that is a legitimate democratic</v>

2749
02:01:52.250 --> 02:01:55.220
<v Speaker 3>aspiration for people to be able to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if it means that it does,</v>

2750
02:01:55.250 --> 02:01:58.280
<v Speaker 3>it's not legal in Alabama because a</v>
<v Speaker 3>majority of people in Alabama don't want</v>

2751
02:01:58.281 --> 02:02:00.230
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think the founding fathers would</v>

2752
02:02:00.231 --> 02:02:01.100
<v Speaker 3>have a problem with that.</v>

2753
02:02:01.190 --> 02:02:03.470
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a strong amount of large amount</v>

2754
02:02:03.471 --> 02:02:06.830
<v Speaker 4>of people that don't want men talking</v>
<v Speaker 4>about this at all,</v>

2755
02:02:07.190 --> 02:02:10.010
<v Speaker 4>that they will follow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You should be able to discuss this.</v>

2756
02:02:10.020 --> 02:02:11.470
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is the problem.</v>

2757
02:02:11.480 --> 02:02:13.570
<v Speaker 4>That is one of the main problems and</v>
<v Speaker 4>female issue.</v>

2758
02:02:13.620 --> 02:02:18.620
<v Speaker 4>Remember as well woman being upset that</v>
<v Speaker 4>a man with no stake in the game is</v>

2759
02:02:19.251 --> 02:02:22.820
<v Speaker 4>stepping up and saying that a woman</v>
<v Speaker 4>should or should not be able to have an</v>

2760
02:02:22.821 --> 02:02:23.230
<v Speaker 4>abortion?</v>

2761
02:02:23.230 --> 02:02:24.063
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>

2762
02:02:24.310 --> 02:02:27.370
<v Speaker 3>I mean how do I have stake in the game</v>
<v Speaker 3>of whether or not,</v>

2763
02:02:27.371 --> 02:02:28.990
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>murder should be legal.</v>

2764
02:02:29.080 --> 02:02:29.421
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2765
02:02:29.421 --> 02:02:31.100
<v Speaker 4>this is not that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>

2766
02:02:31.130 --> 02:02:33.820
<v Speaker 4>this is something different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is someone</v>

2767
02:02:36.260 --> 02:02:40.400
<v Speaker 4>in might be to you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it might not be to them if it's just</v>

2768
02:02:40.410 --> 02:02:41.243
<v Speaker 4>having like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2769
02:02:41.720 --> 02:02:45.320
<v Speaker 4>here's the morning after pill.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that the same as an abortion?</v>

2770
02:02:46.820 --> 02:02:49.380
<v Speaker 3>I don't care because I don't think</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's anything wrong with abortion.</v>

2771
02:02:49.381 --> 02:02:49.821
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2772
02:02:49.821 --> 02:02:50.750
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's any wrong.</v>

2773
02:02:50.780 --> 02:02:53.050
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the shutter is if it's a nine month old</v>

2774
02:02:53.080 --> 02:02:54.760
<v Speaker 4>baby,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the baby's in there and it's about to</v>

2775
02:02:54.761 --> 02:02:56.920
<v Speaker 4>come out the next day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>decided to open her up and stabbed in</v>

2776
02:02:56.921 --> 02:02:57.200
<v Speaker 4>the head.</v>

2777
02:02:57.200 --> 02:03:00.620
<v Speaker 3>This is what I'm arguing for is that is</v>
<v Speaker 3>a kind of incrementalism which you were</v>

2778
02:03:00.621 --> 02:03:01.550
<v Speaker 3>just alluding to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2779
02:03:01.551 --> 02:03:03.320
<v Speaker 3>It's not a black or white thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why can't we?</v>

2780
02:03:03.500 --> 02:03:07.700
<v Speaker 3>Why can't we all appreciate that it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>both because it's become so polarized in</v>

2781
02:03:07.701 --> 02:03:12.140
<v Speaker 3>the United States that both positions</v>
<v Speaker 3>are bullshit and people on both sides</v>

2782
02:03:12.141 --> 02:03:17.141
<v Speaker 3>know that both positions are bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's bullshit to say that it is just a</v>

2783
02:03:17.331 --> 02:03:21.170
<v Speaker 3>women's health issue and has no ethical</v>
<v Speaker 3>implications whatsoever.</v>

2784
02:03:21.200 --> 02:03:22.550
<v Speaker 3>Even if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you say,</v>

2785
02:03:22.940 --> 02:03:25.940
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about cutting a woman</v>
<v Speaker 3>open at nine months and stabbing in the</v>

2786
02:03:26.300 --> 02:03:29.690
<v Speaker 3>embryo in the head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also bullshit to say that the</v>

2787
02:03:29.691 --> 02:03:33.830
<v Speaker 3>instant an egg is fertilized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is a person that should have all of</v>

2788
02:03:33.831 --> 02:03:38.060
<v Speaker 3>the rights to life than an adult should</v>
<v Speaker 3>have and then it's murder to kill a</v>

2789
02:03:38.061 --> 02:03:40.430
<v Speaker 3>blastocyst,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but smaller than the size of the head of</v>

2790
02:03:40.431 --> 02:03:44.630
<v Speaker 3>a pin positions a stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is an incremental situation.</v>

2791
02:03:44.630 --> 02:03:46.520
<v Speaker 3>Life evolves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It grows,</v>

2792
02:03:46.521 --> 02:03:49.100
<v Speaker 3>a fetus grows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It becomes a human being.</v>

2793
02:03:49.101 --> 02:03:50.000
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Peter Singer,</v>

2794
02:03:50.270 --> 02:03:53.480
<v Speaker 3>the great philosopher,</v>
<v Speaker 3>also an Australian says that under</v>

2795
02:03:53.481 --> 02:03:55.010
<v Speaker 3>certain conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>infanticide,</v>

2796
02:03:55.011 --> 02:03:57.800
<v Speaker 3>the killing of babies should be legal</v>
<v Speaker 3>and could be ethical.</v>

2797
02:03:57.830 --> 02:04:00.440
<v Speaker 3>While he's an animal nut,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he loves animals more than,</v>

2798
02:04:00.510 --> 02:04:02.760
<v Speaker 3>but he makes a legitimate point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is that,</v>

2799
02:04:02.830 --> 02:04:04.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why does it make a difference?</v>

2800
02:04:04.820 --> 02:04:08.330
<v Speaker 3>One day after the baby is born,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I suppose you've got a premature baby</v>

2801
02:04:08.331 --> 02:04:11.470
<v Speaker 3>that's born four weeks early.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2802
02:04:11.600 --> 02:04:14.120
<v Speaker 3>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now we can already make babies survive</v>

2803
02:04:14.121 --> 02:04:16.850
<v Speaker 3>at right at right around the point of</v>
<v Speaker 3>viability,</v>

2804
02:04:16.851 --> 02:04:20.270
<v Speaker 3>which is where abortion is still on the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the fringe of.</v>

2805
02:04:20.271 --> 02:04:23.300
<v Speaker 3>So say you've got a 22 or 23,</v>
<v Speaker 3>24 week old,</v>

2806
02:04:23.690 --> 02:04:25.750
<v Speaker 3>a baby,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>

2807
02:04:25.940 --> 02:04:30.940
<v Speaker 3>not we called baby you timing from the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the moment of inception conception</v>

2808
02:04:31.790 --> 02:04:34.830
<v Speaker 3>that could live outside the womb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2809
02:04:34.880 --> 02:04:37.500
<v Speaker 3>But the moment it gets born,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it becomes murder to kill it.</v>

2810
02:04:37.770 --> 02:04:38.040
<v Speaker 3>But you</v>

2811
02:04:38.040 --> 02:04:41.460
<v Speaker 1>could have killed exactly the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>organism with exactly the same future</v>

2812
02:04:41.490 --> 02:04:45.450
<v Speaker 1>and exactly the same prospects and</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly the same life if it was inside</v>

2813
02:04:45.451 --> 02:04:49.320
<v Speaker 1>the womb and of states.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2814
02:04:49.321 --> 02:04:51.570
<v Speaker 1>well on underbrush,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on Roe v Wade,</v>

2815
02:04:51.660 --> 02:04:54.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm not talking about late term,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about the point of viability</v>

2816
02:04:54.850 --> 02:04:56.790
<v Speaker 1>beat Roe v Wade state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2817
02:04:56.890 --> 02:04:58.160
<v Speaker 1>the viability time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2818
02:04:58.170 --> 02:05:00.270
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been interpreted as being like that</v>

2819
02:05:00.271 --> 02:05:03.530
<v Speaker 1>20 to 24 week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this is specifically say that I</v>

2820
02:05:03.531 --> 02:05:04.231
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think,</v>

2821
02:05:04.231 --> 02:05:07.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't know whether or not that comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of the actual ruling where they were</v>

2822
02:05:07.081 --> 02:05:09.900
<v Speaker 1>writing it in Roe v Wade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do know that that is the way that</v>

2823
02:05:09.901 --> 02:05:12.180
<v Speaker 1>it's been interpreted by lower courts</v>
<v Speaker 1>since then.</v>

2824
02:05:12.250 --> 02:05:13.680
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe they actually spelled out the</v>

2825
02:05:13.681 --> 02:05:15.330
<v Speaker 1>number of weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Either way,</v>

2826
02:05:16.200 --> 02:05:17.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's pointing to a,</v>

2827
02:05:17.791 --> 02:05:21.150
<v Speaker 1>to a legitimate conundrum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was sort of moral hypocrisy,</v>

2828
02:05:22.830 --> 02:05:23.820
<v Speaker 1>slippery issue.</v>

2829
02:05:23.850 --> 02:05:25.700
<v Speaker 1>It's not simple black or white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2830
02:05:25.710 --> 02:05:28.650
<v Speaker 1>And the idea that we shouldn't be</v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed to think and talk about the</v>

2831
02:05:28.770 --> 02:05:31.710
<v Speaker 1>moral quandary of this because we can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have babies.</v>

2832
02:05:31.740 --> 02:05:33.040
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not agreeing as silly.</v>

2833
02:05:33.080 --> 02:05:34.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm not agreeing to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2834
02:05:34.291 --> 02:05:36.240
<v Speaker 1>I know what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is an argument that women want to</v>

2835
02:05:36.241 --> 02:05:41.241
<v Speaker 1>take it because they feel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they feel like there's this unjust sort</v>

2836
02:05:43.291 --> 02:05:48.000
<v Speaker 1>of male dominance on the female</v>
<v Speaker 1>reproductive system.</v>

2837
02:05:48.060 --> 02:05:53.060
<v Speaker 1>Look when I see a bunch of white men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>white old men sitting in Congress making</v>

2838
02:05:53.281 --> 02:05:57.060
<v Speaker 1>rules against women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>predominantly young women,</v>

2839
02:05:57.090 --> 02:06:01.560
<v Speaker 1>predominantly young women of color who</v>
<v Speaker 1>are in areas that have less the least</v>

2840
02:06:01.561 --> 02:06:05.070
<v Speaker 1>amount of access,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which siphoned legally women of color.</v>

2841
02:06:05.100 --> 02:06:08.160
<v Speaker 1>How so?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because safe legal abortions are more</v>

2842
02:06:08.161 --> 02:06:12.630
<v Speaker 1>difficult to obtain in places like rural</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alabama than they are in places like New</v>

2843
02:06:12.630 --> 02:06:13.520
<v Speaker 1>York City.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2844
02:06:13.530 --> 02:06:15.990
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of white people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rural Alabama.</v>

2845
02:06:16.010 --> 02:06:18.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't necessarily think it's a racial</v>
<v Speaker 1>issue as much as the poverty issue,</v>

2846
02:06:19.380 --> 02:06:22.590
<v Speaker 1>especially like things like planned</v>
<v Speaker 1>parenthood and shutting down planned</v>

2847
02:06:22.591 --> 02:06:24.000
<v Speaker 1>parenthood's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just going to affect people that</v>

2848
02:06:24.001 --> 02:06:25.140
<v Speaker 1>don't have much money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

2849
02:06:25.200 --> 02:06:27.270
<v Speaker 1>Who had disproportionately people of</v>
<v Speaker 1>color as well.</v>

2850
02:06:27.750 --> 02:06:31.370
<v Speaker 1>Disproportionately in terms of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>actual numbers of human beings are</v>

2851
02:06:32.020 --> 02:06:35.400
<v Speaker 1>intended to percentage wise a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The actual emotional lives of human</v>

2852
02:06:35.401 --> 02:06:36.750
<v Speaker 1>beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not right,</v>

2853
02:06:36.751 --> 02:06:38.640
<v Speaker 1>but you can understand how it would look</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad.</v>

2854
02:06:38.641 --> 02:06:41.860
<v Speaker 1>If you're a black woman ad people of</v>
<v Speaker 1>color to that,</v>

2855
02:06:41.861 --> 02:06:44.520
<v Speaker 1>it accentuates the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes it even more problematic.</v>

2856
02:06:44.521 --> 02:06:47.340
<v Speaker 1>It makes it more of a big left wing</v>
<v Speaker 1>progressive issue.</v>

2857
02:06:47.760 --> 02:06:49.110
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That can't be argued against.</v>

2858
02:06:49.111 --> 02:06:51.960
<v Speaker 1>Do you think the is discrimination</v>
<v Speaker 1>against people of Color?</v>

2859
02:06:51.990 --> 02:06:52.980
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to do that.</v>

2860
02:06:53.280 --> 02:06:56.580
<v Speaker 1>It's people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but do you think that the optics would</v>

2861
02:06:56.581 --> 02:06:59.760
<v Speaker 1>look as bad if all of the old white men</v>
<v Speaker 1>who were writing the laws were black?</v>

2862
02:07:00.630 --> 02:07:03.360
<v Speaker 1>I think it all looks bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I would look as bad.</v>

2863
02:07:03.750 --> 02:07:04.950
<v Speaker 1>The idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold on a second.</v>

2864
02:07:04.980 --> 02:07:08.940
<v Speaker 1>You're saying that if old white men make</v>
<v Speaker 1>these issues,</v>

2865
02:07:08.970 --> 02:07:10.800
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't look as bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know what I'm saying?</v>

2866
02:07:10.801 --> 02:07:12.210
<v Speaker 1>It looks worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bad as possible.</v>

2867
02:07:12.211 --> 02:07:16.620
<v Speaker 1>It looks worse than it was black and men</v>
<v Speaker 1>were making this issue against all poor</v>

2868
02:07:16.621 --> 02:07:21.600
<v Speaker 1>people because old white men just seem</v>
<v Speaker 1>to drip privilege because they use every</v>

2869
02:07:21.601 --> 02:07:23.540
<v Speaker 1>single checkbox they've got going for</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

2870
02:07:23.550 --> 02:07:26.480
<v Speaker 1>They both male,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're white and they're all sure</v>

2871
02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:28.030
<v Speaker 1>argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

2872
02:07:28.080 --> 02:07:30.000
<v Speaker 1>they're tortured arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thomas,</v>

2873
02:07:30.120 --> 02:07:32.730
<v Speaker 1>you don't think it looks weird when</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clarence Thomas Votes against abortion?</v>

2874
02:07:33.270 --> 02:07:34.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

2875
02:07:34.580 --> 02:07:35.413
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there you go.</v>

2876
02:07:35.620 --> 02:07:36.100
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my</v>

2877
02:07:36.100 --> 02:07:38.040
<v Speaker 3>point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my point is simply yes.</v>

2878
02:07:38.850 --> 02:07:39.510
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

2879
02:07:39.510 --> 02:07:43.800
<v Speaker 3>I take the optics as being a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the optics are worse if it's</v>

2880
02:07:43.801 --> 02:07:46.160
<v Speaker 3>white people and if it's black people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm happy to,</v>

2881
02:07:46.290 --> 02:07:49.440
<v Speaker 3>I'm happy to yield that point to concede</v>
<v Speaker 3>that point if that's the sticking one.</v>

2882
02:07:50.100 --> 02:07:54.710
<v Speaker 3>The point is we have to be able to have</v>
<v Speaker 3>conversations about anything without</v>

2883
02:07:54.711 --> 02:07:58.730
<v Speaker 3>allowing our identities to prevent us</v>
<v Speaker 3>from being able to think.</v>

2884
02:07:59.630 --> 02:08:04.160
<v Speaker 3>To ponder that I came on this show was</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I was getting into an argument</v>

2885
02:08:04.400 --> 02:08:09.400
<v Speaker 3>with an activist about whether or not I</v>
<v Speaker 3>had a right to have an opinion about</v>

2886
02:08:10.401 --> 02:08:13.250
<v Speaker 3>whether or not Stephen Colbert had been</v>
<v Speaker 3>racist.</v>

2887
02:08:13.910 --> 02:08:16.520
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she was claiming that I didn't,</v>

2888
02:08:16.550 --> 02:08:19.550
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have a right to have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation about it because I'm a</v>

2889
02:08:19.551 --> 02:08:20.384
<v Speaker 3>white man.</v>

2890
02:08:20.420 --> 02:08:23.480
<v Speaker 4>Well that was just the way she tried to</v>
<v Speaker 4>get out of the argument.</v>

2891
02:08:23.930 --> 02:08:28.550
<v Speaker 4>You know the whole thing before that was</v>
<v Speaker 4>her not understanding the joke and she</v>

2892
02:08:28.551 --> 02:08:31.280
<v Speaker 4>didn't want to own up to the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 4>she didn't understand the joke.</v>

2893
02:08:31.281 --> 02:08:33.200
<v Speaker 4>And then when you sort of explained it</v>
<v Speaker 4>to her,</v>

2894
02:08:33.201 --> 02:08:35.880
<v Speaker 4>she was using the you as a white man</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

2895
02:08:35.881 --> 02:08:37.910
<v Speaker 4>They try to deny your opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't you think?</v>

2896
02:08:37.911 --> 02:08:41.060
<v Speaker 4>It happens all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean just exactly what you're saying.</v>

2897
02:08:41.240 --> 02:08:43.640
<v Speaker 4>I think we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're both on the same page here in that</v>

2898
02:08:43.641 --> 02:08:46.100
<v Speaker 4>I think we both agree that you should</v>
<v Speaker 4>absolutely be able to have a</v>

2899
02:08:46.101 --> 02:08:48.230
<v Speaker 4>conversation about this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The question is,</v>

2900
02:08:48.560 --> 02:08:53.560
<v Speaker 4>should a man be able to decide what a</v>
<v Speaker 4>woman can and can't do with their body</v>

2901
02:08:54.141 --> 02:08:57.080
<v Speaker 4>and should we be able to make the laws?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you just smuggled in the term with</v>

2902
02:08:57.081 --> 02:08:57.914
<v Speaker 4>her body.</v>

2903
02:08:57.950 --> 02:08:58.850
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is a baby.</v>

2904
02:08:58.851 --> 02:09:01.370
<v Speaker 4>If it's a blastocyst and it is in our</v>
<v Speaker 4>body,</v>

2905
02:09:01.580 --> 02:09:03.860
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's a blessing to her body,</v>

2906
02:09:03.880 --> 02:09:05.990
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that is a decision that we're talking</v>

2907
02:09:05.991 --> 02:09:08.870
<v Speaker 4>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when it gets to be an embryo or fetus</v>

2908
02:09:09.470 --> 02:09:11.690
<v Speaker 4>along the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>somewhere along the way,</v>

2909
02:09:11.691 --> 02:09:15.740
<v Speaker 4>it ceases to be just her body,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but an unrelated male human being.</v>

2910
02:09:15.770 --> 02:09:19.790
<v Speaker 4>When should that person be able to make</v>
<v Speaker 4>a decision and should a male human being</v>

2911
02:09:19.791 --> 02:09:22.580
<v Speaker 4>be able to make a decision at all?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because if you can make a decision about</v>

2912
02:09:23.030 --> 02:09:25.940
<v Speaker 4>the embryo or a fetus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can you make it about the blastocyst?</v>

2913
02:09:25.960 --> 02:09:29.510
<v Speaker 4>Like when can you decide and why should</v>
<v Speaker 4>a man be able to make that decision in</v>

2914
02:09:29.511 --> 02:09:30.850
<v Speaker 4>the first place?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because he's got,</v>

2915
02:09:30.950 --> 02:09:34.790
<v Speaker 4>because he's got a brain as well and</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're rolling and you deciding trolling</v>

2916
02:09:34.791 --> 02:09:37.400
<v Speaker 4>someone's body,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you are talking about controlling a</v>

2917
02:09:37.401 --> 02:09:38.151
<v Speaker 4>body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

2918
02:09:38.151 --> 02:09:41.870
<v Speaker 4>Which a woman with a black side of her,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you tell her she can't take care of that</v>

2919
02:09:41.871 --> 02:09:45.100
<v Speaker 4>blastocyst and remove it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She must make it viable and bring it to</v>

2920
02:09:45.160 --> 02:09:47.290
<v Speaker 3>birth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about when a homosapien</v>

2921
02:09:47.291 --> 02:09:49.660
<v Speaker 3>comes into existence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a philosophical and ethical</v>

2922
02:09:49.661 --> 02:09:50.120
<v Speaker 3>questions.</v>

2923
02:09:50.120 --> 02:09:50.631
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not.</v>

2924
02:09:50.631 --> 02:09:52.250
<v Speaker 4>If you're telling me framing it as</v>
<v Speaker 4>being,</v>

2925
02:09:52.251 --> 02:09:53.660
<v Speaker 4>if you're telling a woman's body,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2926
02:09:53.661 --> 02:09:53.841
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2927
02:09:53.841 --> 02:09:57.770
<v Speaker 4>because we're talking about the rights.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Giving someone a ride or stopping them</v>

2928
02:09:57.771 --> 02:09:58.730
<v Speaker 4>and controlling them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2929
02:09:58.760 --> 02:10:01.010
<v Speaker 4>If you're talking about a blastocyst</v>
<v Speaker 4>inside a woman's body,</v>

2930
02:10:01.100 --> 02:10:02.240
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're a man and you decide,</v>

2931
02:10:02.241 --> 02:10:05.750
<v Speaker 4>you don't even know this woman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You decide by your moral argument and</v>

2932
02:10:05.751 --> 02:10:08.870
<v Speaker 4>judgment she should not be able to</v>
<v Speaker 4>terminate that blastocyst.</v>

2933
02:10:09.080 --> 02:10:11.930
<v Speaker 4>Then you are deciding what she can do</v>
<v Speaker 4>with her body.</v>

2934
02:10:12.810 --> 02:10:14.340
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're deciding what she can do to the</v>

2935
02:10:14.341 --> 02:10:16.290
<v Speaker 3>blastocyst.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's in her body.</v>

2936
02:10:16.420 --> 02:10:17.790
<v Speaker 3>It's inside her buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You sure?</v>

2937
02:10:17.791 --> 02:10:19.410
<v Speaker 3>It's also inside her body when it's nine</v>
<v Speaker 3>one</v>

2938
02:10:19.430 --> 02:10:23.030
<v Speaker 4>it's all so you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you're saying a man unrelated man</v>

2939
02:10:23.210 --> 02:10:26.330
<v Speaker 4>should be able to have input on whether</v>
<v Speaker 4>a woman should not determine it.</v>

2940
02:10:26.331 --> 02:10:27.590
<v Speaker 4>A blastocyst saying,</v>

2941
02:10:27.870 --> 02:10:31.560
<v Speaker 3>saying that the democratic institutions</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the state should be able to decide</v>

2942
02:10:31.561 --> 02:10:32.060
<v Speaker 3>that</v>

2943
02:10:32.060 --> 02:10:34.000
<v Speaker 4>mean talking about democratic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're</v>

2944
02:10:34.010 --> 02:10:36.500
<v Speaker 5>talking very specifically about a man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What are you talking,</v>

2945
02:10:36.501 --> 02:10:38.690
<v Speaker 5>being able to decide if it's a</v>
<v Speaker 5>dictatorship,</v>

2946
02:10:38.691 --> 02:10:41.450
<v Speaker 5>then I don't agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do believe that people should be able</v>

2947
02:10:41.451 --> 02:10:43.340
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think this is something that people</v>

2948
02:10:43.341 --> 02:10:44.600
<v Speaker 5>ought to be able to vote on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

2949
02:10:44.780 --> 02:10:47.990
<v Speaker 5>I personally again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>favor abortion rights,</v>

2950
02:10:48.260 --> 02:10:50.840
<v Speaker 5>but I don't think that the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that the gender of the</v>

2951
02:10:50.841 --> 02:10:55.841
<v Speaker 5>person who is voted into power by the</v>
<v Speaker 5>voting public is relevant in terms of</v>

2952
02:10:56.481 --> 02:10:59.720
<v Speaker 5>whether or not the voting public thinks</v>
<v Speaker 5>that embryos are human beings,</v>

2953
02:10:59.750 --> 02:11:01.160
<v Speaker 5>but you don't think that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just think,</v>

2954
02:11:01.161 --> 02:11:03.200
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that embryos have a right</v>
<v Speaker 5>to life,</v>

2955
02:11:03.710 --> 02:11:06.080
<v Speaker 5>but I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that it makes sense to say</v>

2956
02:11:06.290 --> 02:11:10.040
<v Speaker 5>that an embryo is just the woman's body.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're not talking about an embryo.</v>

2957
02:11:10.100 --> 02:11:11.600
<v Speaker 5>We're talking about the entire process,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2958
02:11:11.990 --> 02:11:15.170
<v Speaker 5>The entire process of conception to</v>
<v Speaker 5>birth and that somewhere along the way.</v>

2959
02:11:15.170 --> 02:11:17.090
<v Speaker 5>What do you like and then you arguing</v>
<v Speaker 5>that if,</v>

2960
02:11:17.100 --> 02:11:19.910
<v Speaker 5>if there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if there are males in positions of power</v>

2961
02:11:19.911 --> 02:11:23.510
<v Speaker 5>and congress that they should have to</v>
<v Speaker 5>abstain from ruling.</v>

2962
02:11:23.760 --> 02:11:26.870
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure shit in male justices on the</v>
<v Speaker 5>supreme court have to abstain from</v>

2963
02:11:26.871 --> 02:11:31.871
<v Speaker 5>voting on abortion cases.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm arguing that it's problematic when a</v>

2964
02:11:31.881 --> 02:11:36.881
<v Speaker 5>man decides who can not get pregnant,</v>
<v Speaker 5>decides when a baby is actually a baby,</v>

2965
02:11:40.730 --> 02:11:44.470
<v Speaker 5>so it shouldn't be allowed to vote for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying that I'm the same</v>

2966
02:11:44.480 --> 02:11:47.600
<v Speaker 5>candidates that are antiabortion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't you think it's problematic that a</v>

2967
02:11:47.601 --> 02:11:50.330
<v Speaker 5>guy should decide whether it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like say if you're a hardcore where I've</v>

2968
02:11:50.331 --> 02:11:53.470
<v Speaker 5>already said it looks bad,</v>
<v Speaker 5>optics is luck,</v>

2969
02:11:53.480 --> 02:11:55.640
<v Speaker 5>looks man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but what does a couple of medic main</v>

2970
02:11:55.641 --> 02:11:56.730
<v Speaker 5>other than looks?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2971
02:11:56.780 --> 02:11:57.640
<v Speaker 5>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a,</v>

2972
02:11:57.641 --> 02:11:59.540
<v Speaker 5>it's a huge issue.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not looks,</v>

2973
02:11:59.600 --> 02:12:03.260
<v Speaker 5>it's a huge issue that someone who</v>
<v Speaker 5>cannot get pregnant decides that another</v>

2974
02:12:03.261 --> 02:12:05.720
<v Speaker 5>human being,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that they're totally unrelated to can't</v>

2975
02:12:05.721 --> 02:12:09.230
<v Speaker 5>make the decision that five cells that</v>
<v Speaker 5>are bundled together must be brought to</v>

2976
02:12:09.231 --> 02:12:10.064
<v Speaker 5>life.</v>

2977
02:12:10.280 --> 02:12:12.320
<v Speaker 5>They think that those five cells are a</v>
<v Speaker 5>person.</v>

2978
02:12:12.470 --> 02:12:13.550
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't even know this.</v>

2979
02:12:13.580 --> 02:12:14.960
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're just a lot of cells.</v>

2980
02:12:15.110 --> 02:12:17.530
<v Speaker 5>They don't even know this person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't know this for wash.</v>

2981
02:12:17.550 --> 02:12:21.310
<v Speaker 5>They have any power over this person and</v>
<v Speaker 5>why should they have any power or his to</v>

2982
02:12:21.400 --> 02:12:25.820
<v Speaker 5>determining what are they controlling a</v>
<v Speaker 5>person's body and when are they saving a</v>

2983
02:12:25.821 --> 02:12:27.200
<v Speaker 5>baby?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2984
02:12:27.201 --> 02:12:28.550
<v Speaker 5>that's precisely the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the question,</v>

2985
02:12:28.551 --> 02:12:29.210
<v Speaker 5>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2986
02:12:29.210 --> 02:12:30.410
<v Speaker 5>That is the question.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Should they,</v>

2987
02:12:30.411 --> 02:12:33.770
<v Speaker 5>should a male have the right to</v>
<v Speaker 5>determine whether or not a woman can</v>

2988
02:12:34.190 --> 02:12:36.230
<v Speaker 5>murder her newborn baby?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a good question.</v>

2989
02:12:36.530 --> 02:12:37.520
<v Speaker 5>I say no.</v>

2990
02:12:39.290 --> 02:12:40.850
<v Speaker 5>At least she consistent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2991
02:12:41.120 --> 02:12:44.900
<v Speaker 5>I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think anybody should be able to</v>

2992
02:12:44.901 --> 02:12:47.750
<v Speaker 5>murder a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think a man should have the</v>

2993
02:12:47.751 --> 02:12:49.130
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think we,</v>

2994
02:12:49.131 --> 02:12:51.980
<v Speaker 5>society as a society collectively know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You were just,</v>

2995
02:12:51.981 --> 02:12:53.080
<v Speaker 5>I thought you were just saying that</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'd,</v>

2996
02:12:53.120 --> 02:12:56.360
<v Speaker 5>you'd think that a man should not be</v>
<v Speaker 5>able to prevent a mother from killing</v>

2997
02:12:56.361 --> 02:12:57.131
<v Speaker 5>her baby.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2998
02:12:57.131 --> 02:12:58.550
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I said that wrong.</v>

2999
02:12:58.720 --> 02:13:01.220
<v Speaker 5>What I mean is no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because that is what you're saying with</v>

3000
02:13:01.221 --> 02:13:04.480
<v Speaker 5>regard to the abortion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're saying that a man shouldn't have</v>

3001
02:13:04.481 --> 02:13:06.470
<v Speaker 5>a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>should not have the right to prevent a</v>

3002
02:13:06.471 --> 02:13:08.100
<v Speaker 5>woman from killing her baby.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Very.</v>

3003
02:13:08.930 --> 02:13:10.910
<v Speaker 5>When we interrupt each other it's not</v>
<v Speaker 5>going to work.</v>

3004
02:13:10.940 --> 02:13:12.120
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3005
02:13:12.121 --> 02:13:14.990
<v Speaker 5>I know what you're saying and I know</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you're saying that we should all</v>

3006
02:13:14.991 --> 02:13:16.880
<v Speaker 5>have a stake in this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We shall be able to discuss this.</v>

3007
02:13:17.210 --> 02:13:19.970
<v Speaker 5>I just think that when you talk about</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

3008
02:13:19.971 --> 02:13:22.580
<v Speaker 5>especially like a blastocyst eventually</v>
<v Speaker 5>becoming an embryo,</v>

3009
02:13:22.581 --> 02:13:27.290
<v Speaker 5>we have to agree in some way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>shape or form that you and I don't have</v>

3010
02:13:27.291 --> 02:13:30.370
<v Speaker 5>a stake in it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're not going to get pregnant.</v>

3011
02:13:30.640 --> 02:13:31.473
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a a way,</v>

3012
02:13:31.530 --> 02:13:31.980
<v Speaker 5>it's a way</v>

3013
02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:33.900
<v Speaker 1>bigger issue for a woman than it is for</v>
<v Speaker 1>Matt.</v>

3014
02:13:34.410 --> 02:13:36.960
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we agree.</v>

3015
02:13:37.440 --> 02:13:40.800
<v Speaker 1>We agree that it's a way bigger issue</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a woman that I should be able to</v>

3016
02:13:40.801 --> 02:13:42.870
<v Speaker 1>discuss it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think we both agree that you</v>

3017
02:13:42.871 --> 02:13:46.350
<v Speaker 1>should be able to discuss it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should be able to debate.</v>

3018
02:13:46.351 --> 02:13:51.351
<v Speaker 1>Where I'm coming from here is that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel like we use identity politics to</v>

3019
02:13:51.750 --> 02:13:56.640
<v Speaker 1>deprive other people of standing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>discuss questions that are actually</v>

3020
02:13:56.641 --> 02:13:58.590
<v Speaker 1>universal because they're moral</v>
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>

3021
02:13:58.970 --> 02:14:02.700
<v Speaker 1>And I think we all have one thing that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>tried to do as much as possible as</v>

3022
02:14:02.701 --> 02:14:04.500
<v Speaker 1>understand where people who I disagree</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

3023
02:14:04.520 --> 02:14:05.353
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming from.</v>

3024
02:14:05.900 --> 02:14:07.350
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I know you do that as well.</v>

3025
02:14:07.620 --> 02:14:12.620
<v Speaker 1>So I am pro abortion rights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in order for me to understand where</v>

3026
02:14:12.661 --> 02:14:15.150
<v Speaker 1>people who detest abortion are coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

3027
02:14:15.450 --> 02:14:20.450
<v Speaker 1>it's necessary for me to make the sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of leap of empathy and logic into their</v>

3028
02:14:21.151 --> 02:14:23.370
<v Speaker 1>camp and see things from the way that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they see them,</v>

3029
02:14:23.371 --> 02:14:26.160
<v Speaker 1>which is that the instant egg is</v>
<v Speaker 1>fertilized for them.</v>

3030
02:14:26.160 --> 02:14:29.610
<v Speaker 1>That becomes a sacred,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sacred question of a new life where</v>

3031
02:14:29.611 --> 02:14:33.210
<v Speaker 1>it's no longer about the woman's body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's now a moral and ethical question</v>

3032
02:14:33.211 --> 02:14:36.450
<v Speaker 1>that we're all involved in because we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>all involved in what our culture is</v>

3033
02:14:36.451 --> 02:14:39.090
<v Speaker 1>allowed to do and who it's allowed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>kill and how it's allowed to kill them.</v>

3034
02:14:39.091 --> 02:14:42.720
<v Speaker 1>So it becomes a bit more like a death</v>
<v Speaker 1>penalty question where you might say,</v>

3035
02:14:43.110 --> 02:14:44.400
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm never going to be up for the death</v>

3036
02:14:44.401 --> 02:14:47.400
<v Speaker 1>penalty because I'm never going to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything that would require that would</v>

3037
02:14:47.401 --> 02:14:50.730
<v Speaker 1>put me on death row.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what standing do I have to be in</v>

3038
02:14:50.731 --> 02:14:54.690
<v Speaker 1>favor or against the death penalty?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's sort of a moot question.</v>

3039
02:14:54.691 --> 02:14:57.810
<v Speaker 1>Like we're all in the society together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll have to figure out what's right</v>

3040
02:14:57.811 --> 02:15:00.870
<v Speaker 1>and wrong and if we've got a brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should have conversations about</v>

3041
02:15:00.871 --> 02:15:05.010
<v Speaker 1>what's good or bad and the fact that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>unlikely to be in a specific scenario,</v>

3042
02:15:05.190 --> 02:15:08.340
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't actually really give me less</v>
<v Speaker 1>standing to have a conversation about it</v>

3043
02:15:08.550 --> 02:15:10.200
<v Speaker 1>or even to write laws about it.</v>

3044
02:15:10.230 --> 02:15:12.780
<v Speaker 1>If people vote me into a position where</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can write laws about it.</v>

3045
02:15:13.020 --> 02:15:14.940
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I certainly think it does when you're</v>

3046
02:15:14.941 --> 02:15:17.340
<v Speaker 1>talking about a blastocyst,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I certainly think it does.</v>

3047
02:15:17.341 --> 02:15:19.950
<v Speaker 1>When you talk about the argument of</v>
<v Speaker 1>conception and when something becomes</v>

3048
02:15:19.951 --> 02:15:21.540
<v Speaker 1>alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let me ask you this.</v>

3049
02:15:21.840 --> 02:15:24.180
<v Speaker 1>When do you think abortion should be</v>
<v Speaker 1>legal?</v>

3050
02:15:24.360 --> 02:15:27.150
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it should be legal up to</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine months or these things should be</v>

3051
02:15:27.151 --> 02:15:30.780
<v Speaker 1>cut off period?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it should basically be legal all</v>

3052
02:15:30.781 --> 02:15:33.120
<v Speaker 1>the way up to nine months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I probably agree with Peter Singer</v>

3053
02:15:33.121 --> 02:15:35.920
<v Speaker 1>that maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's occasionally okay to kill by</v>

3054
02:15:35.921 --> 02:15:36.754
<v Speaker 1>Biz.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>

3055
02:15:36.990 --> 02:15:39.960
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you think that a viable baby inside a</v>

3056
02:15:39.961 --> 02:15:42.390
<v Speaker 1>woman's body at nine months old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's fully pregnant.</v>

3057
02:15:42.660 --> 02:15:45.930
<v Speaker 1>As long as that baby doesn't come out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she should be able to kill it.</v>

3058
02:15:45.960 --> 02:15:47.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying even if it does come out,</v>

3059
02:15:47.460 --> 02:15:51.960
<v Speaker 1>maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm evil,</v>

3060
02:15:52.020 --> 02:15:56.520
<v Speaker 1>that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>murder a baby.</v>

3061
02:15:57.330 --> 02:15:58.870
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>religious people think that you think</v>

3062
02:15:58.871 --> 02:16:01.770
<v Speaker 1>that because they think that blast</v>
<v Speaker 1>assistant blastocyst about religious</v>

3063
02:16:01.771 --> 02:16:02.820
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about you.</v>

3064
02:16:03.990 --> 02:16:04.823
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

3065
02:16:05.150 --> 02:16:10.150
<v Speaker 1>I think it's obvious that the process of</v>
<v Speaker 1>going from an egg into a Joe Rogan is</v>

3066
02:16:11.101 --> 02:16:16.101
<v Speaker 1>such a long and incremental passage that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't see any reason why 20 weeks or</v>

3067
02:16:17.101 --> 02:16:22.101
<v Speaker 1>22 weeks or even vaginal birth is like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the absolute moral cutoff I would watch.</v>

3068
02:16:24.720 --> 02:16:27.810
<v Speaker 1>What you think though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's weird that you have this</v>

3069
02:16:27.811 --> 02:16:30.700
<v Speaker 1>like really rigid opinion on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any rigid opinion.</v>

3070
02:16:31.410 --> 02:16:33.340
<v Speaker 1>You could kill a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't think that's rigid?</v>

3071
02:16:33.370 --> 02:16:36.370
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I'm absolutely open to being</v>

3072
02:16:36.400 --> 02:16:39.040
<v Speaker 1>convinced out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just I happened to read a book by</v>

3073
02:16:39.041 --> 02:16:41.800
<v Speaker 1>paid us sing or about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he sort of convinced me,</v>

3074
02:16:42.040 --> 02:16:44.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean what you would have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you should be able to kill a baby</v>

3075
02:16:44.861 --> 02:16:45.694
<v Speaker 1>when it's born.</v>

3076
02:16:45.790 --> 02:16:48.130
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they would be systems in place that</v>

3077
02:16:48.131 --> 02:16:50.680
<v Speaker 1>would like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would help mothers.</v>

3078
02:16:50.710 --> 02:16:53.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that it should be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sort of agree with Bill Clinton's old</v>

3079
02:16:53.951 --> 02:16:56.440
<v Speaker 1>framing that abortion should be safe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>legal and rare,</v>

3080
02:16:57.130 --> 02:16:58.900
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That you should have as many</v>

3081
02:16:58.901 --> 02:17:01.330
<v Speaker 1>opportunities for people not to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>pregnant in the first place.</v>

3082
02:17:01.540 --> 02:17:05.650
<v Speaker 1>Widespread contracept contraception,</v>
<v Speaker 1>widespread sex education.</v>

3083
02:17:06.130 --> 02:17:09.760
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that this should not just be a form</v>

3084
02:17:09.761 --> 02:17:12.310
<v Speaker 1>of birth control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>

3085
02:17:12.311 --> 02:17:17.311
<v Speaker 1>if people find themselves in a horrible</v>
<v Speaker 1>pickle and that I know of how to get out</v>

3086
02:17:17.921 --> 02:17:19.390
<v Speaker 1>of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think you should be able to hit the</v>

3087
02:17:19.391 --> 02:17:22.030
<v Speaker 1>baby with a rock?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to do it.</v>

3088
02:17:22.040 --> 02:17:22.930
<v Speaker 1>He has a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really,</v>

3089
02:17:23.480 --> 02:17:24.880
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

3090
02:17:24.881 --> 02:17:26.210
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds pretty horrible,</v>

3091
02:17:26.270 --> 02:17:28.960
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does,</v>

3092
02:17:28.961 --> 02:17:31.030
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't get pregnant.</v>

3093
02:17:31.110 --> 02:17:32.740
<v Speaker 1>I can't get pregnant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's true.</v>

3094
02:17:32.920 --> 02:17:33.240
<v Speaker 1>Pete.</v>

3095
02:17:33.240 --> 02:17:36.400
<v Speaker 1>I could feel my kids three holes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're getting furious at us right now</v>

3096
02:17:36.401 --> 02:17:39.220
<v Speaker 1>for even discussing it because we can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>get pregnant.</v>

3097
02:17:39.310 --> 02:17:41.110
<v Speaker 1>They're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're wrong.</v>

3098
02:17:41.170 --> 02:17:42.730
<v Speaker 1>But you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3099
02:17:42.790 --> 02:17:44.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm right that I should be able to talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>

3100
02:17:44.681 --> 02:17:48.790
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know what the answer is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You definitely should be able to talk</v>

3101
02:17:48.791 --> 02:17:50.320
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it should be able to kill a baby</v>

3102
02:17:50.321 --> 02:17:51.250
<v Speaker 1>with a rock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3103
02:17:51.251 --> 02:17:52.940
<v Speaker 1>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>

3104
02:17:52.970 --> 02:17:54.460
<v Speaker 1>probably not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I talk about that,</v>

3105
02:17:54.461 --> 02:17:57.880
<v Speaker 1>I'll never be on death row and maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how I get on death killing my</v>

3106
02:17:57.881 --> 02:18:01.960
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so evil and unsympathetic and</v>

3107
02:18:02.020 --> 02:18:06.790
<v Speaker 1>un-empathetic paying a blastocyst is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same journal it is,</v>

3108
02:18:06.791 --> 02:18:10.600
<v Speaker 1>but you don't see that little fucker</v>
<v Speaker 1>last assistance as long as it would have</v>

3109
02:18:10.601 --> 02:18:13.320
<v Speaker 1>to have like reading glasses on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you look at it at the head of it?</v>

3110
02:18:13.321 --> 02:18:16.600
<v Speaker 1>As long as you put a comforter over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>baby so you can't see what's happening.</v>

3111
02:18:16.630 --> 02:18:20.980
<v Speaker 1>I think what we're talking about is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>really complicated subject and I think</v>

3112
02:18:20.981 --> 02:18:25.330
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the reasons why people like</v>
<v Speaker 1>to box it and put it into this yes or no</v>

3113
02:18:25.630 --> 02:18:28.200
<v Speaker 1>black or white because it's so</v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated.</v>

3114
02:18:28.210 --> 02:18:31.600
<v Speaker 1>You really sit back and think that hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have an abortion at,</v>

3115
02:18:31.630 --> 02:18:32.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four weeks,</v>

3116
02:18:32.681 --> 02:18:33.514
<v Speaker 1>five weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>

3117
02:18:33.520 --> 02:18:35.170
<v Speaker 1>when does it have fingers?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3118
02:18:35.171 --> 02:18:36.430
<v Speaker 1>Why does it have a heartbeat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When is it?</v>

3119
02:18:36.431 --> 02:18:41.431
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's also incredibly fraught with</v>

3120
02:18:41.800 --> 02:18:43.120
<v Speaker 1>trip wires,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3121
02:18:43.121 --> 02:18:45.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are not going to be with me,</v>

3122
02:18:45.120 --> 02:18:48.340
<v Speaker 1>mason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you should be able to kill a baby</v>

3123
02:18:48.341 --> 02:18:50.950
<v Speaker 1>and people are not going to be happy</v>
<v Speaker 1>with you saying it should be able to</v>

3124
02:18:50.951 --> 02:18:53.890
<v Speaker 1>kill a blastocyst.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think more people will hate my</v>

3125
02:18:53.891 --> 02:18:54.724
<v Speaker 1>position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3126
02:18:54.910 --> 02:18:56.680
<v Speaker 1>if it even is a position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3127
02:18:56.681 --> 02:18:59.800
<v Speaker 1>when does a blastocyst,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it that the moment of conception,</v>

3128
02:18:59.801 --> 02:19:02.620
<v Speaker 1>like how much time do you have?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like a race to kill the</v>

3129
02:19:02.621 --> 02:19:03.454
<v Speaker 1>baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need,</v>

3130
02:19:05.260 --> 02:19:07.630
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people don't think you should even</v>

3131
02:19:07.631 --> 02:19:09.490
<v Speaker 1>be able to use contraception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3132
02:19:09.491 --> 02:19:11.800
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also like this is one of those</v>

3133
02:19:11.801 --> 02:19:14.110
<v Speaker 1>things were a bit like pedophilia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3134
02:19:14.160 --> 02:19:16.360
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a subject where it's not really</v>

3135
02:19:16.570 --> 02:19:19.570
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's so it raises passions.</v>

3136
02:19:19.600 --> 02:19:22.960
<v Speaker 1>So immediately look at what happened to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Milo Yiannopoulos when he was talking</v>

3137
02:19:22.961 --> 02:19:24.460
<v Speaker 1>about his pedophilia stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3138
02:19:24.530 --> 02:19:26.110
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was also talking about his own</v>

3139
02:19:26.111 --> 02:19:28.400
<v Speaker 1>personal experiences and framing</v>

3140
02:19:28.400 --> 02:19:29.980
<v Speaker 4>them in a positive way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3141
02:19:29.990 --> 02:19:34.280
<v Speaker 4>And even saying that he was a sexual</v>
<v Speaker 4>Predator last we said on my podcast when</v>

3142
02:19:34.281 --> 02:19:37.640
<v Speaker 4>he got on the other podcast when he was</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the drunken peasants podcast,</v>

3143
02:19:37.641 --> 02:19:42.230
<v Speaker 4>that's where it get got more weird</v>
<v Speaker 4>because then he started framing it in a</v>

3144
02:19:42.231 --> 02:19:46.700
<v Speaker 4>different way and saying that he thinks</v>
<v Speaker 4>that there is a lot of positive benefits</v>

3145
02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:49.160
<v Speaker 4>to a young man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

3146
02:19:49.161 --> 02:19:50.780
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I shouldn't say young man,</v>

3147
02:19:50.810 --> 02:19:55.810
<v Speaker 4>a boy having a relationship with a man</v>
<v Speaker 4>sexually that can help them and that</v>

3148
02:19:56.780 --> 02:20:00.500
<v Speaker 4>there's positive benefits to being</v>
<v Speaker 4>molested as a young boy.</v>

3149
02:20:00.650 --> 02:20:03.500
<v Speaker 3>I think that's obviously a horrible</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing to say.</v>

3150
02:20:03.720 --> 02:20:07.800
<v Speaker 4>I think what was going on was he was</v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to rationalize his own sexual</v>

3151
02:20:07.801 --> 02:20:09.070
<v Speaker 4>abuse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>

3152
02:20:10.230 --> 02:20:12.030
<v Speaker 4>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3153
02:20:12.031 --> 02:20:16.830
<v Speaker 4>I think in no way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shape or form is it comfortable for a</v>

3154
02:20:16.831 --> 02:20:20.670
<v Speaker 4>young boy to be sexually abused by an</v>
<v Speaker 4>older man.</v>

3155
02:20:20.940 --> 02:20:25.940
<v Speaker 4>And I think that in this process of</v>
<v Speaker 4>rationalization he's created this way</v>

3156
02:20:26.611 --> 02:20:30.420
<v Speaker 4>that's empowered him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he's also rationalize that he was</v>

3157
02:20:30.421 --> 02:20:33.480
<v Speaker 4>the Predator and he keeps saying that</v>
<v Speaker 4>and joking around about it,</v>

3158
02:20:33.800 --> 02:20:37.470
<v Speaker 4>but he was the attain those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he's a victim and I think his,</v>

3159
02:20:38.370 --> 02:20:40.530
<v Speaker 4>his,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a very strong,</v>

3160
02:20:40.531 --> 02:20:45.531
<v Speaker 4>smart guy and I think a lot of his</v>
<v Speaker 4>intelligence as allowed him to use his</v>

3161
02:20:47.101 --> 02:20:52.020
<v Speaker 4>perception of that event to sort of</v>
<v Speaker 4>shape it into a way that benefits him.</v>

3162
02:20:52.180 --> 02:20:53.013
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

3163
02:20:53.380 --> 02:20:55.240
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the,</v>

3164
02:20:55.630 --> 02:21:00.010
<v Speaker 3>I was on a TV show in Australia where</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a question of whether or not</v>

3165
02:21:00.370 --> 02:21:03.640
<v Speaker 3>we should be naming and shaming sexual</v>
<v Speaker 3>offenders,</v>

3166
02:21:03.641 --> 02:21:08.260
<v Speaker 3>sexual predators or people who've been</v>
<v Speaker 3>convicted of sex crimes and in the</v>

3167
02:21:08.261 --> 02:21:10.450
<v Speaker 3>meeting before we went on air because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a live show,</v>

3168
02:21:10.510 --> 02:21:13.840
<v Speaker 3>I raised the point that like I think the</v>
<v Speaker 3>more sort of interesting and</v>

3169
02:21:13.841 --> 02:21:18.841
<v Speaker 3>controversial angle here is what a</v>
<v Speaker 3>bloody horrible nightmare it would be to</v>

3170
02:21:21.071 --> 02:21:24.310
<v Speaker 3>be born being sexually attracted towards</v>
<v Speaker 3>infants.</v>

3171
02:21:24.730 --> 02:21:28.660
<v Speaker 3>Right now this is in no way to diminish</v>
<v Speaker 3>the monstrosity that is pedophilia.</v>

3172
02:21:28.661 --> 02:21:33.250
<v Speaker 3>I think it's the worst thing that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can do to abuse the trust of children</v>

3173
02:21:33.251 --> 02:21:37.750
<v Speaker 3>who are too young to know any better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's surely no walk in the park like</v>

3174
02:21:37.751 --> 02:21:40.240
<v Speaker 3>the reason I'm not a pedophile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not because I'm a good person,</v>

3175
02:21:40.330 --> 02:21:43.510
<v Speaker 3>it's because I have no attraction</v>
<v Speaker 3>towards children.</v>

3176
02:21:44.200 --> 02:21:46.600
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if the only way that you could</v>

3177
02:21:46.601 --> 02:21:51.190
<v Speaker 3>express yourself sexually and find</v>
<v Speaker 3>fulfillment in life was by torturing</v>

3178
02:21:51.191 --> 02:21:54.010
<v Speaker 3>another human being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you're basically a form of,</v>

3179
02:21:54.430 --> 02:21:56.890
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to use the wrong word here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a form of,</v>

3180
02:21:56.891 --> 02:22:00.370
<v Speaker 3>it's a form of psychopathy in some way</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the sense that like a psychopath can</v>

3181
02:22:00.371 --> 02:22:03.160
<v Speaker 3>only get fulfillment by doing something</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's awful.</v>

3182
02:22:03.161 --> 02:22:06.130
<v Speaker 3>So the job is to try to figure out how</v>
<v Speaker 3>to stop the psychopath from doing</v>

3183
02:22:06.131 --> 02:22:07.960
<v Speaker 3>something awful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that pedophiles,</v>

3184
02:22:07.961 --> 02:22:10.570
<v Speaker 3>the psychopaths,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can see the analogy where if</v>

3185
02:22:10.600 --> 02:22:14.170
<v Speaker 3>your only way of finding fulfillment in</v>
<v Speaker 3>life is to rape children,</v>

3186
02:22:14.500 --> 02:22:19.500
<v Speaker 3>then let's address how to figure out how</v>
<v Speaker 3>to stop you from doing that thing rather</v>

3187
02:22:20.291 --> 02:22:23.470
<v Speaker 3>than demonizing you as a monster,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if you don't do it.</v>

3188
02:22:23.960 --> 02:22:26.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for me to even say that,</v>

3189
02:22:26.280 --> 02:22:28.290
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people are going to push back</v>
<v Speaker 3>on that as well,</v>

3190
02:22:28.291 --> 02:22:31.770
<v Speaker 3>and it's a very similar thing to where</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just trying to figure out in my head</v>

3191
02:22:31.771 --> 02:22:33.930
<v Speaker 3>what makes the most sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as you say,</v>

3192
02:22:34.080 --> 02:22:37.590
<v Speaker 3>it's got to be some kind of a spectrum</v>
<v Speaker 3>of like it can't be black and white</v>

3193
02:22:37.650 --> 02:22:39.870
<v Speaker 3>either on abortion or on something like</v>
<v Speaker 3>pedophilia.</v>

3194
02:22:39.871 --> 02:22:42.720
<v Speaker 3>But the moment you start having</v>
<v Speaker 3>conversations like this shit's going to</v>

3195
02:22:42.721 --> 02:22:44.490
<v Speaker 3>explode because people are very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

3196
02:22:44.491 --> 02:22:47.130
<v Speaker 3>very strident.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you've got to protect the babies.</v>

3197
02:22:47.131 --> 02:22:49.050
<v Speaker 3>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to protect the children.</v>

3198
02:22:49.051 --> 02:22:50.160
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand that.</v>

3199
02:22:50.730 --> 02:22:53.160
<v Speaker 3>But does that make it impossible for us</v>
<v Speaker 3>to have conversations about it?</v>

3200
02:22:53.290 --> 02:22:55.450
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the issue is should you even be</v>

3201
02:22:55.451 --> 02:22:59.170
<v Speaker 4>allowed to have a conversation about it</v>
<v Speaker 4>and should you have a rigid black or</v>

3202
02:22:59.171 --> 02:23:01.320
<v Speaker 4>white view of this and if you are and</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3203
02:23:01.360 --> 02:23:03.160
<v Speaker 4>here's the real question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

3204
02:23:03.161 --> 02:23:06.490
<v Speaker 4>we don't know what causes someone to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>sexually attracted to children.</v>

3205
02:23:06.790 --> 02:23:08.590
<v Speaker 4>And we don't know how many of those</v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

3206
02:23:08.591 --> 02:23:11.510
<v Speaker 4>but there's a significant amount who are</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually molested themselves.</v>

3207
02:23:11.980 --> 02:23:15.040
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's a huge factor in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in child abuse.</v>

3208
02:23:15.580 --> 02:23:17.830
<v Speaker 4>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what causes that?</v>

3209
02:23:17.831 --> 02:23:19.300
<v Speaker 4>I mean is it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and here's how to,</v>

3210
02:23:19.420 --> 02:23:22.300
<v Speaker 4>and even more fucked up throughout</v>
<v Speaker 4>history,</v>

3211
02:23:22.330 --> 02:23:24.850
<v Speaker 4>some of the greatest minds have been</v>
<v Speaker 4>pedophiles,</v>

3212
02:23:25.570 --> 02:23:26.710
<v Speaker 4>really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

3213
02:23:26.740 --> 02:23:28.210
<v Speaker 4>Socrates,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Plato.</v>

3214
02:23:28.211 --> 02:23:31.750
<v Speaker 4>I mean you can go back through history.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were all fucking young kids.</v>

3215
02:23:31.960 --> 02:23:35.860
<v Speaker 4>Well then you had the Greeks were like</v>
<v Speaker 4>that when the Romans many,</v>

3216
02:23:35.861 --> 02:23:36.880
<v Speaker 4>many ancient culture</v>

3217
02:23:36.900 --> 02:23:39.390
<v Speaker 3>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that was adolescents though,</v>

3218
02:23:39.391 --> 02:23:40.500
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They will fucking right</v>

3219
02:23:40.900 --> 02:23:45.070
<v Speaker 4>fucking 12 year olds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like [inaudible] was talking about</v>

3220
02:23:45.550 --> 02:23:47.620
<v Speaker 4>pedophilia and where you're talking</v>
<v Speaker 4>about babies,</v>

3221
02:23:47.621 --> 02:23:49.780
<v Speaker 4>which I think is probably even more</v>
<v Speaker 4>rare.</v>

3222
02:23:50.530 --> 02:23:53.710
<v Speaker 4>Someone fucking young boys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3223
02:23:53.830 --> 02:23:56.980
<v Speaker 4>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a very bizarre part of our human</v>

3224
02:23:56.981 --> 02:23:58.450
<v Speaker 4>history.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Very bizarre.</v>

3225
02:23:58.451 --> 02:24:03.250
<v Speaker 4>And it makes you wonder how much of that</v>
<v Speaker 4>sexual abuse gets somehow or another</v>

3226
02:24:03.251 --> 02:24:07.330
<v Speaker 4>transferred from a child being abused to</v>
<v Speaker 4>that child growing up,</v>

3227
02:24:07.331 --> 02:24:09.220
<v Speaker 4>becoming an adult and becoming an abuser</v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves.</v>

3228
02:24:09.860 --> 02:24:12.100
<v Speaker 4>What it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it a cancer of ideas?</v>

3229
02:24:12.280 --> 02:24:15.790
<v Speaker 4>Is it a dizzy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>almost like a sexual disease that gets</v>

3230
02:24:15.791 --> 02:24:20.140
<v Speaker 4>spread from perpetrator to victim?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The victim becomes perpetrator,</v>

3231
02:24:20.260 --> 02:24:21.340
<v Speaker 4>makes new victims.</v>

3232
02:24:21.390 --> 02:24:24.660
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you think it's the same act now as it</v>

3233
02:24:24.661 --> 02:24:28.430
<v Speaker 3>was back then?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it's more accepted back then it</v>

3234
02:24:28.670 --> 02:24:30.030
<v Speaker 3>back then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I wonder if,</v>

3235
02:24:30.120 --> 02:24:33.890
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if it wouldn't have been less,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>

3236
02:24:33.930 --> 02:24:35.400
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's not less bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to think.</v>

3237
02:24:35.401 --> 02:24:37.350
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking now only about people who</v>

3238
02:24:37.351 --> 02:24:38.310
<v Speaker 3>are sexually immature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3239
02:24:38.311 --> 02:24:41.250
<v Speaker 3>So like someone who's like a 15 year old</v>
<v Speaker 3>catwalk model,</v>

3240
02:24:41.520 --> 02:24:43.800
<v Speaker 3>let's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's assume that it's a woman who's</v>

3241
02:24:43.890 --> 02:24:48.840
<v Speaker 3>walking down the catwalks of Milan and</v>
<v Speaker 3>Paris and has what she thinks is a</v>

3242
02:24:48.841 --> 02:24:53.070
<v Speaker 3>consensual relationship with a 25 year</v>
<v Speaker 3>old fashion designer that's against the</v>

3243
02:24:53.071 --> 02:24:58.071
<v Speaker 3>law and it's regarded as being deeply on</v>
<v Speaker 3>ethical in our current society happened</v>

3244
02:24:58.710 --> 02:25:00.390
<v Speaker 3>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And other societies.</v>

3245
02:25:00.440 --> 02:25:01.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3246
02:25:01.890 --> 02:25:04.110
<v Speaker 3>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that I think that the law</v>

3247
02:25:04.111 --> 02:25:04.944
<v Speaker 3>should be changed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dine,</v>

3248
02:25:04.950 --> 02:25:07.170
<v Speaker 3>I think it's good to have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have laws against these things and I</v>

3249
02:25:07.171 --> 02:25:09.300
<v Speaker 3>don't think that it's ethically</v>
<v Speaker 3>defensible for people who are</v>

3250
02:25:09.670 --> 02:25:11.640
<v Speaker 3>significantly older,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3251
02:25:11.670 --> 02:25:16.670
<v Speaker 3>to assume that the person who is still</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of evolving and still coming of age</v>

3252
02:25:17.041 --> 02:25:18.720
<v Speaker 3>is capable of giving proper consent.</v>

3253
02:25:18.930 --> 02:25:20.670
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's illegal if to just three years</v>

3254
02:25:20.671 --> 02:25:22.980
<v Speaker 3>older.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where it gets really,</v>

3255
02:25:23.230 --> 02:25:25.660
<v Speaker 3>well that is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's chapel I think a week older.</v>

3256
02:25:25.720 --> 02:25:26.441
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

3257
02:25:26.441 --> 02:25:30.430
<v Speaker 3>If they like 17 and 51 weeks and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>other person's 18 and one day it's</v>

3258
02:25:30.431 --> 02:25:31.480
<v Speaker 3>illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's stupid.</v>

3259
02:25:31.481 --> 02:25:34.570
<v Speaker 3>There's a Romeo and Juliet clause that</v>
<v Speaker 3>some countries have.</v>

3260
02:25:34.571 --> 02:25:38.230
<v Speaker 3>Like I think in the Netherlands it's not</v>
<v Speaker 3>against the law to have sex with people</v>

3261
02:25:38.231 --> 02:25:41.170
<v Speaker 3>even as young as 12 or 13 as long as if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're 14.</v>

3262
02:25:42.090 --> 02:25:43.600
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or like if you're like,</v>

3263
02:25:45.340 --> 02:25:48.790
<v Speaker 3>well what does the law to meditate if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're 15 and your girlfriend's 14 does</v>

3264
02:25:48.791 --> 02:25:50.620
<v Speaker 3>that legal?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think it's the state by state</v>

3265
02:25:50.621 --> 02:25:52.000
<v Speaker 3>thing isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's a good question.</v>

3266
02:25:52.001 --> 02:25:54.610
<v Speaker 3>Is that what you would never be</v>
<v Speaker 3>prosecuted but the head,</v>

3267
02:25:54.611 --> 02:25:58.750
<v Speaker 3>there have been these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we had cases where teenagers have been</v>

3268
02:25:58.751 --> 02:26:01.750
<v Speaker 3>prosecuted for high,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for having um,</v>

3269
02:26:01.900 --> 02:26:04.120
<v Speaker 3>like Dick pics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all walls.</v>

3270
02:26:04.570 --> 02:26:07.200
<v Speaker 3>Not only their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their boyfriends or girlfriends from,</v>

3271
02:26:07.240 --> 02:26:11.110
<v Speaker 3>I'm a big piece of they girlfriends</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless they're trans but of themselves.</v>

3272
02:26:11.200 --> 02:26:14.830
<v Speaker 3>And they've been prosecuted for child</v>
<v Speaker 3>porn because they're a child and they,</v>

3273
02:26:14.910 --> 02:26:17.320
<v Speaker 3>they holding pornography the whole bit</v>
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>

3274
02:26:17.560 --> 02:26:19.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That whole bit about this colony.</v>

3275
02:26:19.600 --> 02:26:20.500
<v Speaker 3>Ridiculous.</v>

3276
02:26:20.620 --> 02:26:21.730
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They arrested her.</v>

3277
02:26:22.060 --> 02:26:26.260
<v Speaker 4>She was a sending boys' pictures of her</v>
<v Speaker 4>pussy and they arrested her for child</v>

3278
02:26:26.261 --> 02:26:27.730
<v Speaker 4>pornography.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She was 15 years old.</v>

3279
02:26:29.380 --> 02:26:32.320
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's a weird use of the law.</v>

3280
02:26:32.680 --> 02:26:34.930
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if she's sending it to other girls</v>

3281
02:26:34.931 --> 02:26:37.830
<v Speaker 4>and boys that are her age,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not your business.</v>

3282
02:26:37.870 --> 02:26:40.810
<v Speaker 4>Who are you protecting her in jail?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one.</v>

3283
02:26:40.990 --> 02:26:42.040
<v Speaker 4>But it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>

3284
02:26:42.041 --> 02:26:45.430
<v Speaker 4>an ability what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you give someone a game called</v>

3285
02:26:45.431 --> 02:26:48.120
<v Speaker 4>arrest people that are doing bad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>

3286
02:26:48.170 --> 02:26:49.750
<v Speaker 4>here's the law.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If they don't,</v>

3287
02:26:49.780 --> 02:26:53.710
<v Speaker 4>they don't follow by the byline's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're allowed to lock them in a cage</v>

3288
02:26:53.770 --> 02:26:56.380
<v Speaker 4>and this is your job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're allowed to do that end.</v>

3289
02:26:57.040 --> 02:26:58.960
<v Speaker 4>I want you to rest a certain amount of</v>
<v Speaker 4>people per month,</v>

3290
02:26:58.990 --> 02:27:00.240
<v Speaker 4>otherwise you're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3291
02:27:00.430 --> 02:27:02.600
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's the issue with quotas and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

3292
02:27:02.680 --> 02:27:03.520
<v Speaker 4>and police.</v>

3293
02:27:03.780 --> 02:27:04.613
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3294
02:27:04.940 --> 02:27:07.490
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's almost like I come in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but who I heard saying this the other</v>

3295
02:27:07.490 --> 02:27:10.490
<v Speaker 3>day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that police used to go out and catch bad</v>

3296
02:27:10.491 --> 02:27:14.900
<v Speaker 3>guys and like solve crimes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now we've sort of outsourced it to</v>

3297
02:27:14.901 --> 02:27:18.290
<v Speaker 3>police the job of just making everything</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of Nice.</v>

3298
02:27:18.460 --> 02:27:20.860
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>police are glorified revenue collectors</v>

3299
02:27:20.861 --> 02:27:22.390
<v Speaker 4>and a lot of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3300
02:27:22.391 --> 02:27:25.780
<v Speaker 4>why,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why are they giving people tickets for</v>

3301
02:27:26.030 --> 02:27:28.210
<v Speaker 4>certain traffic violations?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3302
02:27:28.630 --> 02:27:30.450
<v Speaker 4>I mean the smoking a plant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3303
02:27:30.520 --> 02:27:33.480
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of things that people get</v>
<v Speaker 4>arrested for where this,</v>

3304
02:27:33.490 --> 02:27:35.890
<v Speaker 4>they're essentially just providing money</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the system.</v>

3305
02:27:36.210 --> 02:27:36.851
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not,</v>

3306
02:27:36.851 --> 02:27:38.390
<v Speaker 4>they're not serving,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're protecting.</v>

3307
02:27:38.720 --> 02:27:40.760
<v Speaker 3>It's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the things where when I talk</v>

3308
02:27:40.761 --> 02:27:42.740
<v Speaker 3>to Americans about the best things about</v>
<v Speaker 3>America,</v>

3309
02:27:42.741 --> 02:27:45.110
<v Speaker 3>the number one thing that Americans will</v>
<v Speaker 3>always say is freedom.</v>

3310
02:27:45.170 --> 02:27:49.370
<v Speaker 3>That this country represents freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the actual daily experience.</v>

3311
02:27:49.580 --> 02:27:52.910
<v Speaker 3>Like I've lived in New York and I've</v>
<v Speaker 3>lived in Copenhagen and I lived in,</v>

3312
02:27:53.620 --> 02:27:55.970
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Australia and like the daily</v>

3313
02:27:55.971 --> 02:27:58.940
<v Speaker 3>experience of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was standing outside my apartment in</v>

3314
02:27:58.941 --> 02:28:02.540
<v Speaker 3>New York drinking an open beverage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3315
02:28:02.570 --> 02:28:07.070
<v Speaker 3>just watching the world go by and a</v>
<v Speaker 3>couple of cops came over and one of them</v>

3316
02:28:07.071 --> 02:28:08.390
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yo Watson,</v>

3317
02:28:08.391 --> 02:28:10.430
<v Speaker 3>the glass,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's in the glass?</v>

3318
02:28:10.431 --> 02:28:11.540
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just soda.</v>

3319
02:28:11.541 --> 02:28:13.430
<v Speaker 3>It was fuck soda,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just soda.</v>

3320
02:28:13.431 --> 02:28:15.110
<v Speaker 3>And his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his partner had to be like,</v>

3321
02:28:15.140 --> 02:28:15.891
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't worry about it.</v>

3322
02:28:15.891 --> 02:28:16.341
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come on,</v>

3323
02:28:16.341 --> 02:28:18.080
<v Speaker 3>don't make a big deal out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they walked away.</v>

3324
02:28:18.081 --> 02:28:22.250
<v Speaker 3>But I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go to a park in everyone's drinking</v>

3325
02:28:22.250 --> 02:28:22.851
<v Speaker 5>beer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

3326
02:28:22.851 --> 02:28:25.460
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're not getting harassed by cops.</v>

3327
02:28:25.490 --> 02:28:28.610
<v Speaker 5>Isn't that a kind of freedom as well?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're taking off their shirts and their</v>

3328
02:28:28.611 --> 02:28:31.820
<v Speaker 5>playing volleyball,</v>
<v Speaker 5>topless breasts hanging out.</v>

3329
02:28:31.821 --> 02:28:34.760
<v Speaker 5>You're talking about one specific area</v>
<v Speaker 5>because if you go to New Orleans,</v>

3330
02:28:34.761 --> 02:28:36.300
<v Speaker 5>people walked down the street drinking</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the time.</v>

3331
02:28:36.320 --> 02:28:37.220
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's more free.</v>

3332
02:28:37.221 --> 02:28:38.240
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you're in Vegas,</v>

3333
02:28:38.241 --> 02:28:39.840
<v Speaker 5>people walked on the stage second.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3334
02:28:40.080 --> 02:28:40.820
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3335
02:28:40.820 --> 02:28:42.880
<v Speaker 5>is it better to live in Vegas or New</v>
<v Speaker 5>Orleans?</v>

3336
02:28:42.890 --> 02:28:44.390
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some people would say yes and other</v>

3337
02:28:44.391 --> 02:28:46.550
<v Speaker 5>people would say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want that for the children.</v>

3338
02:28:46.580 --> 02:28:48.770
<v Speaker 5>It's bad for the children that are</v>
<v Speaker 5>abort.</v>

3339
02:28:49.690 --> 02:28:50.523
<v Speaker 5>That's wrong.</v>

3340
02:28:52.340 --> 02:28:53.270
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

3341
02:28:53.320 --> 02:28:55.490
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's complex.</v>

3342
02:28:55.520 --> 02:28:57.170
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all these issues are very complex.</v>

3343
02:28:57.171 --> 02:29:00.560
<v Speaker 5>It's like when,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when should you just let people run free</v>

3344
02:29:00.561 --> 02:29:04.850
<v Speaker 5>and ramp into the point where chaos and</v>
<v Speaker 5>suse and here's another problem then</v>

3345
02:29:04.851 --> 02:29:07.280
<v Speaker 5>that was talking about this with a</v>
<v Speaker 5>friend of mine the other day about North</v>

3346
02:29:07.280 --> 02:29:08.510
<v Speaker 5>Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3347
02:29:09.050 --> 02:29:13.970
<v Speaker 5>when people have become sort of</v>
<v Speaker 5>indoctrinated into a specific style of</v>

3348
02:29:13.971 --> 02:29:16.610
<v Speaker 5>life and behavior and then all of a</v>
<v Speaker 5>sudden you remove the rains.</v>

3349
02:29:17.090 --> 02:29:21.020
<v Speaker 5>Like when people who live in Kansas go</v>
<v Speaker 5>to Vegas and bay</v>

3350
02:29:22.970 --> 02:29:25.310
<v Speaker 5>as opposed to someone who grows up in</v>
<v Speaker 5>that environment.</v>

3351
02:29:25.340 --> 02:29:28.460
<v Speaker 5>Or like say we were,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we were looking at the North Korea</v>

3352
02:29:28.461 --> 02:29:32.870
<v Speaker 5>footage yesterday of them goose stepping</v>
<v Speaker 5>down the street and the giant throngs of</v>

3353
02:29:32.871 --> 02:29:36.710
<v Speaker 5>people who are following the orders and</v>
<v Speaker 5>doing the bidding of Kim Jong.</v>

3354
02:29:36.780 --> 02:29:40.580
<v Speaker 5>And we're saying like what would happen</v>
<v Speaker 5>to those people if you're a move this</v>

3355
02:29:40.581 --> 02:29:43.370
<v Speaker 5>military dictatorship gave them a</v>
<v Speaker 5>democratic life,</v>

3356
02:29:43.371 --> 02:29:46.970
<v Speaker 5>would they even be able to appreciate it</v>
<v Speaker 5>and understand it or are they so</v>

3357
02:29:46.971 --> 02:29:51.020
<v Speaker 5>institutionalized or they so</v>
<v Speaker 5>indoctrinated into this very specific</v>

3358
02:29:51.021 --> 02:29:54.530
<v Speaker 5>style of living in behavior that they</v>
<v Speaker 5>wouldn't be able to adjust?</v>

3359
02:29:55.010 --> 02:29:57.080
<v Speaker 5>Like I talked to Ron miscavige about</v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

3360
02:29:57.430 --> 02:29:59.330
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who is he got out of scientology when he</v>

3361
02:29:59.331 --> 02:30:03.560
<v Speaker 5>was fucking 76 I mean stop and think</v>
<v Speaker 5>about that.</v>

3362
02:30:03.561 --> 02:30:08.561
<v Speaker 5>The guy got in in 1970 and got out in</v>
<v Speaker 5>2012 live the bulk of his life in this</v>

3363
02:30:09.771 --> 02:30:14.750
<v Speaker 5>really bizarre environment and now all</v>
<v Speaker 5>of a sudden he's a free man.</v>

3364
02:30:15.110 --> 02:30:17.450
<v Speaker 5>I think that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And this is one of my concerns about,</v>

3365
02:30:17.510 --> 02:30:20.090
<v Speaker 5>about laws that prevent people from</v>
<v Speaker 5>doing things.</v>

3366
02:30:20.480 --> 02:30:25.160
<v Speaker 5>This is why I'm sort of libertarian ish</v>
<v Speaker 5>when it comes to non economic cultural</v>

3367
02:30:25.161 --> 02:30:28.610
<v Speaker 5>issues because I actually think you need</v>
<v Speaker 5>to inculcate in people and experience of</v>

3368
02:30:28.611 --> 02:30:31.610
<v Speaker 5>showing restraint on the bus by</v>
<v Speaker 5>themselves.</v>

3369
02:30:31.611 --> 02:30:34.200
<v Speaker 5>Because if the law is does it for you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

3370
02:30:34.380 --> 02:30:36.290
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you then remove the laws and all of a</v>

3371
02:30:36.291 --> 02:30:37.730
<v Speaker 5>sudden everyone goes crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a bit,</v>

3372
02:30:37.760 --> 02:30:39.710
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can imagine that if all of a sudden</v>

3373
02:30:39.711 --> 02:30:43.490
<v Speaker 5>street drinking were permitted in New</v>
<v Speaker 5>York that people will be vomiting all</v>

3374
02:30:43.491 --> 02:30:46.310
<v Speaker 5>over the place and like getting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>getting drunk because they've been so</v>

3375
02:30:46.311 --> 02:30:49.730
<v Speaker 5>used to so acclimated to never being</v>
<v Speaker 5>allowed to do it.</v>

3376
02:30:49.730 --> 02:30:53.260
<v Speaker 5>That now it's the forbidden fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Go and just get smashed in the past</v>

3377
02:30:53.300 --> 02:30:54.830
<v Speaker 5>because that's what we can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we can do now.</v>

3378
02:30:54.860 --> 02:30:56.690
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you know about Amish Amish?</v>

3379
02:30:56.720 --> 02:30:57.810
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Rubber spring.</v>

3380
02:30:57.850 --> 02:30:59.240
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When they get to do that,</v>

3381
02:30:59.241 --> 02:31:01.910
<v Speaker 5>what was the hell's playground?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that the documentary in the Senate?</v>

3382
02:31:01.980 --> 02:31:04.080
<v Speaker 5>There's a great documentary about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And these,</v>

3383
02:31:04.081 --> 02:31:07.160
<v Speaker 5>these people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have this period of time where</v>

3384
02:31:07.161 --> 02:31:09.290
<v Speaker 5>they're allowed to do whatever the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 5>they want.</v>

3385
02:31:09.291 --> 02:31:11.200
<v Speaker 5>It's basically when they come maintains,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>

3386
02:31:11.210 --> 02:31:11.611
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

3387
02:31:11.611 --> 02:31:14.150
<v Speaker 5>they let loose from the amish</v>
<v Speaker 5>communities and they were allowed to</v>

3388
02:31:14.420 --> 02:31:18.110
<v Speaker 5>indulge jay go hog wild hog where they</v>
<v Speaker 5>go,</v>

3389
02:31:18.111 --> 02:31:19.980
<v Speaker 5>they party fucking hard and then they</v>
<v Speaker 5>have to</v>

3390
02:31:19.980 --> 02:31:22.170
<v Speaker 4>figure out whether or not they want to</v>
<v Speaker 4>go back to being amish.</v>

3391
02:31:22.270 --> 02:31:23.740
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And most of them do.</v>

3392
02:31:23.800 --> 02:31:24.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Strange.</v>

3393
02:31:24.790 --> 02:31:28.900
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting that you used the word</v>
<v Speaker 3>institutions joe to describing like</v>

3394
02:31:28.901 --> 02:31:32.410
<v Speaker 3>North Korea because I think this is</v>
<v Speaker 3>another thing that I'm so grateful about</v>

3395
02:31:32.680 --> 02:31:36.250
<v Speaker 3>America for and why I'm sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>optimistic that trump is not going to</v>

3396
02:31:36.251 --> 02:31:41.251
<v Speaker 3>destroy this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this country that institutions like this</v>

3397
02:31:42.701 --> 02:31:44.260
<v Speaker 3>sounds like such a valley girl thing to</v>
<v Speaker 3>say.</v>

3398
02:31:44.261 --> 02:31:46.220
<v Speaker 3>I was going to say institutions like</v>
<v Speaker 3>really matter</v>

3399
02:31:53.470 --> 02:31:55.440
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

3400
02:31:55.450 --> 02:31:58.030
<v Speaker 3>but it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You look at places like Hungary and what</v>

3401
02:31:58.031 --> 02:32:02.260
<v Speaker 3>we've just seen happen in Turkey and in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Russia,</v>

3402
02:32:02.261 --> 02:32:05.740
<v Speaker 3>in Venezuela.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's much easier for people there</v>

3403
02:32:05.741 --> 02:32:08.500
<v Speaker 3>who are corrupt or who would like to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

3404
02:32:08.990 --> 02:32:12.430
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to bring people under their spell to do</v>

3405
02:32:12.431 --> 02:32:17.290
<v Speaker 3>so because there aren't these big robust</v>
<v Speaker 3>divided institutions like the press</v>

3406
02:32:17.470 --> 02:32:21.160
<v Speaker 3>being fiercely independent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the judicial system being fiercely</v>

3407
02:32:21.340 --> 02:32:22.590
<v Speaker 3>independent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3408
02:32:22.810 --> 02:32:26.650
<v Speaker 3>Congress and the executive hopefully</v>
<v Speaker 3>hating each other just enough to keep</v>

3409
02:32:26.680 --> 02:32:29.050
<v Speaker 3>each other in check,</v>
<v Speaker 3>keep themselves in check.</v>

3410
02:32:29.350 --> 02:32:30.450
<v Speaker 3>And also just the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3411
02:32:30.460 --> 02:32:33.510
<v Speaker 3>the traditions of American life where</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

3412
02:32:33.550 --> 02:32:37.810
<v Speaker 3>there's I think more acceptance of</v>
<v Speaker 3>descent and of weirdness than there are</v>

3413
02:32:37.811 --> 02:32:40.930
<v Speaker 3>in those other places.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Russians are just very,</v>

3414
02:32:41.050 --> 02:32:44.530
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to generalize here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but allow me to conformist people,</v>

3415
02:32:44.560 --> 02:32:48.010
<v Speaker 3>like they've lived under csas and</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking empires for centuries and</v>

3416
02:32:48.011 --> 02:32:50.530
<v Speaker 3>millennia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they like following strong men.</v>

3417
02:32:50.531 --> 02:32:53.080
<v Speaker 3>Americans aren't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And some of them are,</v>

3418
02:32:53.081 --> 02:32:56.170
<v Speaker 3>there is this kind of militaristic</v>
<v Speaker 3>jingoistic side to America,</v>

3419
02:32:56.171 --> 02:33:00.070
<v Speaker 3>which is very kind of like salute the</v>
<v Speaker 3>flag and like say yes please.</v>

3420
02:33:00.071 --> 02:33:02.140
<v Speaker 3>Like you got to honor the honor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the veterans and everything.</v>

3421
02:33:03.020 --> 02:33:03.851
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

3422
02:33:03.851 --> 02:33:05.800
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Respect the office or like kind of</v>

3423
02:33:05.801 --> 02:33:08.710
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that way tyranny lies.</v>

3424
02:33:08.820 --> 02:33:11.140
<v Speaker 3>I think the best,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the best thing as a mayor that America</v>

3425
02:33:11.141 --> 02:33:14.170
<v Speaker 3>has ever kind of given the world is its</v>
<v Speaker 3>flamboyant,</v>

3426
02:33:14.171 --> 02:33:17.560
<v Speaker 3>boisterous sense of possibility and</v>
<v Speaker 3>craziness that expresses itself in</v>

3427
02:33:17.561 --> 02:33:20.530
<v Speaker 3>Silicon Valley.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And maybe Peter Teal who I might not</v>

3428
02:33:20.531 --> 02:33:23.200
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at least he's unusual in Hollywood.</v>

3429
02:33:23.890 --> 02:33:26.140
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even in Wall Street there are a whole</v>

3430
02:33:26.141 --> 02:33:28.690
<v Speaker 3>bunch of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's just an excitement in this</v>

3431
02:33:28.691 --> 02:33:29.524
<v Speaker 3>place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>

3432
02:33:29.530 --> 02:33:33.580
<v Speaker 3>which seeps out in so many different</v>
<v Speaker 3>ways in America that I think to try to</v>

3433
02:33:33.581 --> 02:33:36.070
<v Speaker 3>corral it as a dictator would be like</v>
<v Speaker 3>herding cats.</v>

3434
02:33:36.100 --> 02:33:37.540
<v Speaker 3>Like it'll just never,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3435
02:33:37.541 --> 02:33:38.740
<v Speaker 3>it'll never,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'll never quite right.</v>

3436
02:33:39.020 --> 02:33:41.180
<v Speaker 4>Well we can only hope because if trump</v>
<v Speaker 4>has his way,</v>

3437
02:33:41.181 --> 02:33:44.150
<v Speaker 4>he would definitely try to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He would try to get all these people to</v>

3438
02:33:44.151 --> 02:33:47.030
<v Speaker 4>do his bidding and figure out some way</v>
<v Speaker 4>to dismantle all of these different</v>

3439
02:33:47.031 --> 02:33:51.080
<v Speaker 4>institutions and make it much easier for</v>
<v Speaker 4>him to make America great again and just</v>

3440
02:33:51.081 --> 02:33:52.800
<v Speaker 4>fucking force that agenda through.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3441
02:33:52.850 --> 02:33:54.080
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't think he would think that he's</v>

3442
02:33:54.081 --> 02:33:54.950
<v Speaker 4>doing the wrong thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Woody.</v>

3443
02:33:55.160 --> 02:33:56.330
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think,</v>

3444
02:33:56.390 --> 02:33:58.760
<v Speaker 4>I mean he said he admires Putin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3445
02:33:58.761 --> 02:34:00.770
<v Speaker 4>which is very bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3446
02:34:00.771 --> 02:34:04.190
<v Speaker 4>it's very bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when he compared what Putin does to</v>

3447
02:34:04.191 --> 02:34:06.080
<v Speaker 4>what we do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we do terrible things to like,</v>

3448
02:34:06.470 --> 02:34:07.760
<v Speaker 4>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's crazy.</v>

3449
02:34:07.940 --> 02:34:10.970
<v Speaker 4>That guy murders people on the street.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he,</v>

3450
02:34:10.971 --> 02:34:13.250
<v Speaker 4>any political opposition,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he fucking kills them.</v>

3451
02:34:13.251 --> 02:34:15.950
<v Speaker 4>He kills reporters mean or somebody</v>
<v Speaker 4>does,</v>

3452
02:34:16.130 --> 02:34:18.400
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it's him or somebody</v>
<v Speaker 4>does</v>

3453
02:34:18.400 --> 02:34:22.990
<v Speaker 1>right outside the Kremlin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A W know on the main bridge leading to</v>

3454
02:34:22.991 --> 02:34:26.910
<v Speaker 1>the Kremlin at night and all of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>security cameras from the Kremlin</v>

3455
02:34:26.920 --> 02:34:30.820
<v Speaker 1>happened to go off and have their</v>
<v Speaker 1>footage missing just when the murder,</v>

3456
02:34:31.190 --> 02:34:33.370
<v Speaker 1>it's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The amount of power that he wields.</v>

3457
02:34:33.371 --> 02:34:34.390
<v Speaker 1>His stunning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3458
02:34:34.750 --> 02:34:38.590
<v Speaker 1>If someone on the left in America said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3459
02:34:38.591 --> 02:34:41.290
<v Speaker 1>who's who?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who are we to say that Putin is a bad</v>

3460
02:34:41.291 --> 02:34:42.640
<v Speaker 1>guy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think of all the bad things that</v>

3461
02:34:42.641 --> 02:34:46.930
<v Speaker 1>America's done</v>
<v Speaker 1>just</v>

3462
02:34:48.690 --> 02:34:52.000
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a kind of Noam Chomsky thing to</v>

3463
02:34:52.001 --> 02:34:55.990
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>America's America's chickens are coming</v>

3464
02:34:55.991 --> 02:34:58.580
<v Speaker 1>home to roost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We did this in Vietnam and now so you</v>

3465
02:34:58.581 --> 02:35:00.670
<v Speaker 1>know when I better than Putin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck that.</v>

3466
02:35:00.700 --> 02:35:02.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the right that's supposed to</v>

3467
02:35:02.291 --> 02:35:05.020
<v Speaker 1>believe in American exceptionalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just not trump.</v>

3468
02:35:05.021 --> 02:35:07.750
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got a very bizarre interests in</v>

3469
02:35:07.751 --> 02:35:10.450
<v Speaker 1>Russia and that's one of the reasons I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think why he was want to release his</v>

3470
02:35:10.451 --> 02:35:11.110
<v Speaker 1>taxes.</v>

3471
02:35:11.110 --> 02:35:15.220
<v Speaker 1>The real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real question is how much money does</v>

3472
02:35:15.221 --> 02:35:18.550
<v Speaker 1>he have invested in Russia?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how much,</v>

3473
02:35:18.580 --> 02:35:21.250
<v Speaker 1>how much financial influence do they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have on him?</v>

3474
02:35:21.460 --> 02:35:26.460
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if part of it is when he says</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he admired someone like Putin,</v>

3475
02:35:27.010 --> 02:35:32.010
<v Speaker 1>if it's just his sort of constitutional</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense that he kind of likes a strong</v>

3476
02:35:32.171 --> 02:35:33.850
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like his isn't his whole life sort of</v>

3477
02:35:33.851 --> 02:35:36.790
<v Speaker 1>about I am powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am rich,</v>

3478
02:35:37.360 --> 02:35:40.780
<v Speaker 1>you know you're going to kneel before me</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people who can pull that off.</v>

3479
02:35:41.140 --> 02:35:44.590
<v Speaker 1>I think just resonate with him in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>way that's more so I've always found</v>

3480
02:35:44.591 --> 02:35:49.591
<v Speaker 1>like the how much money does they have</v>
<v Speaker 1>invested in Russia question somewhat</v>

3481
02:35:50.021 --> 02:35:53.440
<v Speaker 1>less interesting to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then why does he want to suck Putin's</v>

3482
02:35:53.441 --> 02:35:56.980
<v Speaker 1>Dixon Ma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know like is it the whole mean</v>

3483
02:35:56.981 --> 02:35:59.620
<v Speaker 1>interpretation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a convenient interpretation of what</v>

3484
02:35:59.621 --> 02:36:02.200
<v Speaker 1>Putin represents because he doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>really have time to look at all these</v>

3485
02:36:02.201 --> 02:36:03.034
<v Speaker 1>different things.</v>

3486
02:36:03.070 --> 02:36:04.480
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was revealed the other day that he's</v>

3487
02:36:04.481 --> 02:36:07.250
<v Speaker 1>not really aware that Kim Jong loons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dot.</v>

3488
02:36:07.300 --> 02:36:09.270
<v Speaker 1>Kim Jong Il.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you see that?</v>

3489
02:36:09.290 --> 02:36:11.710
<v Speaker 1>It is confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are too many Kim's in the careers,</v>

3490
02:36:11.740 --> 02:36:16.740
<v Speaker 1>but you did not say that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's like this ridiculous thing where</v>

3491
02:36:16.931 --> 02:36:20.530
<v Speaker 1>he was talking about this gentleman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was talking about Kim Jong and he was</v>

3492
02:36:20.531 --> 02:36:25.050
<v Speaker 1>referring to conversations that Kim Jong</v>
<v Speaker 1>Il has had with Bush and I mean the</v>

3493
02:36:25.090 --> 02:36:27.100
<v Speaker 1>whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's too many things to focus</v>

3494
02:36:27.101 --> 02:36:32.101
<v Speaker 1>on and he's so fucking busy with himself</v>
<v Speaker 1>and his business interests and the</v>

3495
02:36:32.531 --> 02:36:35.110
<v Speaker 1>things that he's trying to push through</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're going to Exxon mobile and all</v>

3496
02:36:35.111 --> 02:36:37.180
<v Speaker 1>these different subsidiaries that he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of invested in.</v>

3497
02:36:37.480 --> 02:36:42.250
<v Speaker 1>He's got his fucking fingers in so many</v>
<v Speaker 1>different pies and he's also just not</v>

3498
02:36:42.251 --> 02:36:46.990
<v Speaker 1>interested in the affairs of state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't care about foreign policy and</v>

3499
02:36:46.991 --> 02:36:48.280
<v Speaker 1>stuff like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a little bit,</v>

3500
02:36:48.281 --> 02:36:49.860
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't like learning and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't like it.</v>

3501
02:36:49.861 --> 02:36:53.380
<v Speaker 1>He's not a good reader or what's one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big concerns is that he's not</v>

3502
02:36:53.381 --> 02:36:57.100
<v Speaker 1>concerned with foreign policy to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>point where he's putting off all these</v>

3503
02:36:57.101 --> 02:37:00.160
<v Speaker 1>things and letting the military do their</v>
<v Speaker 1>job in quotes.</v>

3504
02:37:00.161 --> 02:37:03.520
<v Speaker 1>Did you see the point that he didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>even authorize the mother of all bombs</v>

3505
02:37:03.521 --> 02:37:05.290
<v Speaker 1>when it was dropped on Afghanistan last</v>
<v Speaker 1>week?</v>

3506
02:37:05.291 --> 02:37:08.440
<v Speaker 1>The military,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the option to do what they think is</v>

3507
02:37:08.441 --> 02:37:11.290
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what Eisenhower warned about</v>

3508
02:37:11.291 --> 02:37:12.310
<v Speaker 1>when he left on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

3509
02:37:12.550 --> 02:37:15.980
<v Speaker 1>But in some crazy way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't you feel more safe</v>

3510
02:37:16.010 --> 02:37:19.550
<v Speaker 5>with the military doing it then with</v>
<v Speaker 5>trump doing it in some way?</v>

3511
02:37:19.551 --> 02:37:20.540
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>absolutely.</v>

3512
02:37:20.600 --> 02:37:23.030
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think there's a real argument that the</v>

3513
02:37:23.031 --> 02:37:28.031
<v Speaker 5>military has been,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that they've been held back to the Paul.</v>

3514
02:37:29.100 --> 02:37:30.080
<v Speaker 5>They have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3515
02:37:30.081 --> 02:37:31.370
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're engaging in war,</v>

3516
02:37:31.371 --> 02:37:33.450
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that there's a real argument that</v>

3517
02:37:33.451 --> 02:37:37.430
<v Speaker 5>the people in the military make that</v>
<v Speaker 5>people die because they're forced to</v>

3518
02:37:37.431 --> 02:37:41.000
<v Speaker 5>take too many steps before they get</v>
<v Speaker 5>clearance to do something when they're</v>

3519
02:37:41.001 --> 02:37:45.050
<v Speaker 5>being attacked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so their argument is it's better to</v>

3520
02:37:45.051 --> 02:37:48.230
<v Speaker 5>let people who really understand war</v>
<v Speaker 5>engage in more,</v>

3521
02:37:48.770 --> 02:37:51.110
<v Speaker 5>but then there's the eisenhower argument</v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

3522
02:37:51.300 --> 02:37:54.680
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're dealing with an institution like</v>

3523
02:37:54.681 --> 02:37:58.700
<v Speaker 5>the military industrial complex.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're dealing with a l I can think of</v>

3524
02:37:58.701 --> 02:38:02.230
<v Speaker 5>it as an organism that survives on war</v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

3525
02:38:02.270 --> 02:38:06.410
<v Speaker 5>there's a tremendous amount of money</v>
<v Speaker 5>that gets pumped into this,</v>

3526
02:38:06.500 --> 02:38:08.690
<v Speaker 5>this thing that this war machine.</v>

3527
02:38:08.690 --> 02:38:09.440
<v Speaker 5>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3528
02:38:09.440 --> 02:38:12.010
<v Speaker 5>And then what does it want to do?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It wants to fucking use all the</v>

3529
02:38:12.020 --> 02:38:13.580
<v Speaker 5>statistics that a war.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>

3530
02:38:14.510 --> 02:38:16.820
<v Speaker 5>Have you noticed how the the military</v>
<v Speaker 5>contractors,</v>

3531
02:38:16.821 --> 02:38:20.150
<v Speaker 5>if you looked at how,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how delicately spread out around America</v>

3532
02:38:20.151 --> 02:38:23.930
<v Speaker 5>that like they have plants in almost</v>
<v Speaker 5>every single state so that there's</v>

3533
02:38:23.931 --> 02:38:28.040
<v Speaker 5>always a congressperson or a senator who</v>
<v Speaker 5>are the military contractors can call up</v>

3534
02:38:28.041 --> 02:38:28.950
<v Speaker 5>and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well you,</v>

3535
02:38:28.951 --> 02:38:31.640
<v Speaker 5>you're going to lose like 70,000 jobs in</v>
<v Speaker 5>this little,</v>

3536
02:38:31.760 --> 02:38:34.340
<v Speaker 5>of course shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Potel it'd actually be more,</v>

3537
02:38:34.341 --> 02:38:36.950
<v Speaker 5>it would make more economic sense for</v>
<v Speaker 5>them to have consolidated their</v>

3538
02:38:36.951 --> 02:38:40.340
<v Speaker 5>operations and be making all the</v>
<v Speaker 5>submarines and warships in the same</v>

3539
02:38:40.341 --> 02:38:41.000
<v Speaker 5>place,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they don't.</v>

3540
02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:43.430
<v Speaker 5>They make one widget in Delaware,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then make another one over here.</v>

3541
02:38:43.431 --> 02:38:45.560
<v Speaker 5>Another one over here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's very select got congressman.</v>

3542
02:38:45.640 --> 02:38:47.270
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No one's ever going to want that plant</v>

3543
02:38:47.271 --> 02:38:48.104
<v Speaker 5>to close.</v>

3544
02:38:48.650 --> 02:38:51.470
<v Speaker 5>It's like mudgee things that we've</v>
<v Speaker 5>talked about today.</v>

3545
02:38:51.890 --> 02:38:55.820
<v Speaker 5>There's super complicated and there's so</v>
<v Speaker 5>many different things to consider and</v>

3546
02:38:55.821 --> 02:38:59.900
<v Speaker 5>it's no real one black and white answer</v>
<v Speaker 5>when when you're dealing with so many</v>

3547
02:38:59.901 --> 02:39:03.410
<v Speaker 5>factions in so many variables and so</v>
<v Speaker 5>many things.</v>

3548
02:39:03.800 --> 02:39:07.190
<v Speaker 5>That's one of the reasons why being a</v>
<v Speaker 5>president is a preposterous idea.</v>

3549
02:39:07.890 --> 02:39:09.380
<v Speaker 5>Is it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's stupid.</v>

3550
02:39:09.710 --> 02:39:10.760
<v Speaker 5>It's stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 5>isn't it?</v>

3551
02:39:10.880 --> 02:39:14.660
<v Speaker 5>If I have too much power,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean you talk about black and white</v>

3552
02:39:14.810 --> 02:39:19.610
<v Speaker 5>and you like shades of gray.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How do you negotiate with the North</v>

3553
02:39:19.610 --> 02:39:23.000
<v Speaker 5>Koreans and the South Koreans and the</v>
<v Speaker 5>Chinese and the Japanese and the</v>

3554
02:39:23.001 --> 02:39:28.001
<v Speaker 5>Russians about what to do about Syria?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'll show a Syria.</v>

3555
02:39:28.160 --> 02:39:29.130
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Shit.</v>

3556
02:39:29.150 --> 02:39:32.270
<v Speaker 5>I mean in some ways.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What did you think of the tree of trump</v>

3557
02:39:32.510 --> 02:39:35.150
<v Speaker 5>hitting Syria?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3558
02:39:35.330 --> 02:39:36.440
<v Speaker 5>no one died,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3559
02:39:36.680 --> 02:39:39.470
<v Speaker 5>What he did was attack airfields and</v>
<v Speaker 5>blew up airfields.</v>

3560
02:39:39.471 --> 02:39:40.910
<v Speaker 5>It was a show of force,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3561
02:39:40.911 --> 02:39:41.930
<v Speaker 5>is it the right thing to do?</v>

3562
02:39:41.940 --> 02:39:42.780
<v Speaker 5>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

3563
02:39:42.860 --> 02:39:43.950
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3564
02:39:44.040 --> 02:39:48.890
<v Speaker 5>I don't understand exactly what is</v>
<v Speaker 5>accomplished other than you blow up an</v>

3565
02:39:48.891 --> 02:39:50.780
<v Speaker 5>airfield and have to rebuild it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3566
02:39:50.781 --> 02:39:53.960
<v Speaker 5>you show people that you can do that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we already knew you could do that.</v>

3567
02:39:54.200 --> 02:39:57.500
<v Speaker 5>You show people you're willing to act.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3568
02:39:57.501 --> 02:40:02.501
<v Speaker 5>back in 2012 and 2013 I thought that</v>
<v Speaker 5>Obama flubbed it by saying that we</v>

3569
02:40:05.571 --> 02:40:09.500
<v Speaker 5>wouldn't tolerate the use of chemical</v>
<v Speaker 5>weapons and then doing nothing when</v>

3570
02:40:09.501 --> 02:40:13.100
<v Speaker 5>reaction by the right and the left</v>
<v Speaker 5>people were very weird war back.</v>

3571
02:40:13.140 --> 02:40:15.210
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think they've relaxed a little over</v>

3572
02:40:15.211 --> 02:40:15.960
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3573
02:40:15.960 --> 02:40:18.210
<v Speaker 5>When will willing to to go in and get a</v>
<v Speaker 5>break.</v>

3574
02:40:18.270 --> 02:40:18.980
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>

3575
02:40:18.980 --> 02:40:19.860
<v Speaker 5>Hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going back in.</v>

3576
02:40:20.700 --> 02:40:21.241
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3577
02:40:21.241 --> 02:40:23.300
<v Speaker 5>when you go in the pool,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you swim for a while,</v>

3578
02:40:23.310 --> 02:40:25.730
<v Speaker 5>then I come back out again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to get cool again without,</v>

3579
02:40:25.780 --> 02:40:27.340
<v Speaker 5>with a nice foreign war.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3580
02:40:27.480 --> 02:40:29.910
<v Speaker 5>There was Vietnam and we didn't like</v>
<v Speaker 5>that and then we can forget it,</v>

3581
02:40:29.960 --> 02:40:32.060
<v Speaker 3>bad it long enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we did it rock and we didn't like</v>

3582
02:40:32.061 --> 02:40:33.530
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But now that's kind of fading,</v>

3583
02:40:33.531 --> 02:40:35.660
<v Speaker 3>receding into the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>into the distant past as well.</v>

3584
02:40:36.230 --> 02:40:37.810
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3585
02:40:37.860 --> 02:40:40.580
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually interviewed Phil Donahue on</v>

3586
02:40:40.610 --> 02:40:44.390
<v Speaker 3>huffpost live because he was a very</v>
<v Speaker 3>outspoken antiwar critic.</v>

3587
02:40:44.600 --> 02:40:46.250
<v Speaker 3>And I was saying at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3588
02:40:46.280 --> 02:40:48.470
<v Speaker 3>can't we be nuanced enough to make a</v>
<v Speaker 3>difference,</v>

3589
02:40:48.471 --> 02:40:51.110
<v Speaker 3>but to understand the difference between</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Iraq war,</v>

3590
02:40:51.320 --> 02:40:56.320
<v Speaker 3>a full scale invasion based on a</v>
<v Speaker 3>misunderstanding or a misleading</v>

3591
02:40:57.411 --> 02:41:00.020
<v Speaker 3>interpretation of what Iraq's</v>
<v Speaker 3>capabilities.</v>

3592
02:41:00.021 --> 02:41:00.860
<v Speaker 3>And it's mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3593
02:41:01.200 --> 02:41:02.780
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>weapons program was,</v>

3594
02:41:03.230 --> 02:41:08.230
<v Speaker 3>and this Syrian problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a horrifying civil war where a</v>

3595
02:41:08.751 --> 02:41:12.740
<v Speaker 3>dictator is gassing his own people and</v>
<v Speaker 3>we didn't want to invade,</v>

3596
02:41:13.100 --> 02:41:16.630
<v Speaker 3>but drawing some kind of a line in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>sand and saying,</v>

3597
02:41:16.640 --> 02:41:21.050
<v Speaker 3>you can't do that in the 21st century.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't just be dropping gas canisters</v>

3598
02:41:21.051 --> 02:41:21.650
<v Speaker 3>on kids.</v>

3599
02:41:21.650 --> 02:41:25.670
<v Speaker 3>So they bleed out their eyes and like</v>
<v Speaker 3>cough up their own lungs.</v>

3600
02:41:25.671 --> 02:41:29.280
<v Speaker 3>That's not a way to behave in the United</v>
<v Speaker 3>States as an exceptional nation.</v>

3601
02:41:29.281 --> 02:41:31.340
<v Speaker 3>And we'll do something about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're right.</v>

3602
02:41:31.341 --> 02:41:34.940
<v Speaker 3>That about it really had his hands tied</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he went to Congress and Congress</v>

3603
02:41:34.941 --> 02:41:39.200
<v Speaker 3>didn't give him the power to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I kind of felt somehow sort of</v>

3604
02:41:39.201 --> 02:41:42.260
<v Speaker 3>slightly vindicated when trump did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I was not one of the people on the</v>

3605
02:41:42.261 --> 02:41:43.820
<v Speaker 3>left who was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my goodness,</v>

3606
02:41:43.821 --> 02:41:44.960
<v Speaker 3>what's he doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3607
02:41:44.980 --> 02:41:45.420
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

3608
02:41:45.420 --> 02:41:48.110
<v Speaker 3>I mean at least that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least it's something</v>

3609
02:41:48.350 --> 02:41:50.630
<v Speaker 5>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's also an incredibly complicated</v>

3610
02:41:50.631 --> 02:41:54.680
<v Speaker 5>situation because Assad is against Isis.</v>

3611
02:41:55.740 --> 02:41:56.350
<v Speaker 6>Okay?</v>

3612
02:41:56.350 --> 02:41:58.360
<v Speaker 3>Superficially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

3613
02:42:00.150 --> 02:42:00.983
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

3614
02:42:02.280 --> 02:42:07.280
<v Speaker 3>he uses isis as an excuse to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 3>target all of his political opponents.</v>

3615
02:42:08.970 --> 02:42:11.660
<v Speaker 3>It's too much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's too twice.</v>

3616
02:42:12.710 --> 02:42:16.350
<v Speaker 3>It's two twice dead end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no way to get rid of isis</v>

3617
02:42:16.560 --> 02:42:21.560
<v Speaker 3>without getting rid of Assad because the</v>
<v Speaker 3>locals in Syria who will lift height</v>

3618
02:42:21.751 --> 02:42:22.800
<v Speaker 3>Assad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who would,</v>

3619
02:42:22.801 --> 02:42:25.290
<v Speaker 3>who are anti Assad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they hate aside even more than they hate</v>

3620
02:42:25.291 --> 02:42:28.140
<v Speaker 3>isis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So as long as Assad is there,</v>

3621
02:42:28.320 --> 02:42:30.210
<v Speaker 3>they're going to give isis their</v>
<v Speaker 3>sympathies.</v>

3622
02:42:30.450 --> 02:42:32.910
<v Speaker 3>So this idea of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3623
02:42:32.911 --> 02:42:36.150
<v Speaker 3>basically the whole isis thing I think</v>
<v Speaker 3>is just a smokescreen to allow Putin and</v>

3624
02:42:36.151 --> 02:42:39.390
<v Speaker 3>Assad to crackdown on dissidents.</v>

3625
02:42:39.630 --> 02:42:43.320
<v Speaker 5>But isn't it also like a lot of the same</v>
<v Speaker 5>issues that they faced when they</v>

3626
02:42:43.321 --> 02:42:47.190
<v Speaker 5>dethroned Khadafi in Libya you create</v>
<v Speaker 5>this to happen.</v>

3627
02:42:47.220 --> 02:42:48.620
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's too late.</v>

3628
02:42:48.810 --> 02:42:49.770
<v Speaker 5>Failed State.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3629
02:42:49.771 --> 02:42:52.650
<v Speaker 5>I think we've missed the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we missed the boat in Syria or what the</v>

3630
02:42:52.651 --> 02:42:53.790
<v Speaker 5>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what do we do?</v>

3631
02:42:53.820 --> 02:42:56.640
<v Speaker 5>President Josh Zaps?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do we do?</v>

3632
02:42:56.670 --> 02:42:58.610
<v Speaker 5>We build a time machine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Joe and uh,</v>

3633
02:42:58.620 --> 02:43:02.930
<v Speaker 5>we go back to 2012 there's not much you</v>
<v Speaker 5>can do that.</v>

3634
02:43:02.950 --> 02:43:04.620
<v Speaker 5>And I did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They probably wasn't even much we could</v>

3635
02:43:04.621 --> 02:43:06.060
<v Speaker 5>do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you think you can imagine,</v>

3636
02:43:06.090 --> 02:43:08.550
<v Speaker 5>oh wait,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you should have like one president that</v>

3637
02:43:08.551 --> 02:43:12.280
<v Speaker 5>deals with just Syria.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like that should be your 100% that's</v>

3638
02:43:12.281 --> 02:43:14.350
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The idea of having a president that also</v>

3639
02:43:14.351 --> 02:43:19.351
<v Speaker 5>deals with Exxon Mobil and BP and then</v>
<v Speaker 5>also was talking to the coal people and</v>

3640
02:43:19.631 --> 02:43:21.860
<v Speaker 5>also is talking to the people in Silicon</v>
<v Speaker 5>Valley.</v>

3641
02:43:21.880 --> 02:43:24.070
<v Speaker 5>You know why you haven't administration,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

3642
02:43:24.070 --> 02:43:24.720
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so the,</v>

3643
02:43:24.720 --> 02:43:27.820
<v Speaker 5>the secretary of State is broadly</v>
<v Speaker 5>overseeing it and then they will have a</v>

3644
02:43:27.821 --> 02:43:30.300
<v Speaker 5>special envoy to the Middle East who</v>
<v Speaker 5>should be split,</v>

3645
02:43:30.310 --> 02:43:33.850
<v Speaker 5>who is basically as the president of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>president of the United States for</v>

3646
02:43:33.851 --> 02:43:34.930
<v Speaker 5>Syria.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3647
02:43:34.931 --> 02:43:37.960
<v Speaker 5>And then Sean Spicer's in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in charge of cleaning up lies.</v>

3648
02:43:38.020 --> 02:43:39.910
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's what he's using</v>
<v Speaker 5>alternative facts.</v>

3649
02:43:39.911 --> 02:43:43.780
<v Speaker 5>President.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you think that that the world would</v>

3650
02:43:43.781 --> 02:43:48.781
<v Speaker 5>be better or worse off if America had</v>
<v Speaker 5>just stayed completely out of the Middle</v>

3651
02:43:48.910 --> 02:43:52.450
<v Speaker 5>East from like the end of the Cold War</v>
<v Speaker 5>on,</v>

3652
02:43:52.720 --> 02:43:55.960
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I don't know how you fix the problem</v>

3653
02:43:55.990 --> 02:43:58.780
<v Speaker 5>of military dictatorships.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How do you,</v>

3654
02:43:58.900 --> 02:44:00.820
<v Speaker 5>how do you stop that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How do you overthrow them?</v>

3655
02:44:00.821 --> 02:44:04.270
<v Speaker 5>I mean the CIA has been battling that</v>
<v Speaker 5>for years.</v>

3656
02:44:04.390 --> 02:44:06.190
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they will propping them up or propping</v>

3657
02:44:06.191 --> 02:44:09.370
<v Speaker 5>them up or propping them up and shooting</v>
<v Speaker 5>them down or you know,</v>

3658
02:44:09.371 --> 02:44:14.050
<v Speaker 5>trying to keep that issue over there and</v>
<v Speaker 5>keeping them from becoming big enough</v>

3659
02:44:14.051 --> 02:44:16.990
<v Speaker 5>where they spread to the point where</v>
<v Speaker 5>they become another Nazi Germany or what</v>

3660
02:44:16.991 --> 02:44:17.824
<v Speaker 5>have you.</v>

3661
02:44:17.920 --> 02:44:20.700
<v Speaker 5>It's a really good question and I'm too</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking stupid to give you an answer.</v>

3662
02:44:22.150 --> 02:44:23.020
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who knows.</v>

3663
02:44:23.021 --> 02:44:25.660
<v Speaker 5>I mean look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just disturbing that something like</v>

3664
02:44:25.661 --> 02:44:29.860
<v Speaker 5>North Korea can exist in 2017.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to go,</v>

3665
02:44:29.890 --> 02:44:32.560
<v Speaker 5>I really want to go to North Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it'd be fascinating.</v>

3666
02:44:33.100 --> 02:44:35.440
<v Speaker 5>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3667
02:44:35.530 --> 02:44:38.410
<v Speaker 5>Cause it's like the last kind of hermit</v>
<v Speaker 5>kingdom lift.</v>

3668
02:44:38.411 --> 02:44:42.910
<v Speaker 5>It's the last true Soviet era.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Communist dictatorship.</v>

3669
02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:44.750
<v Speaker 5>You can probably control.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3670
02:44:44.770 --> 02:44:46.090
<v Speaker 5>I think you can.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3671
02:44:46.091 --> 02:44:48.820
<v Speaker 5>but the problem is you have to be kind</v>
<v Speaker 5>of um,</v>

3672
02:44:49.130 --> 02:44:51.670
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>accompanied by a Chaperon who works for</v>

3673
02:44:51.671 --> 02:44:54.070
<v Speaker 5>the government who only shows you the</v>
<v Speaker 5>things that the government wants you to</v>

3674
02:44:54.071 --> 02:44:55.420
<v Speaker 5>say.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Henry Rollins went,</v>

3675
02:44:55.690 --> 02:44:57.460
<v Speaker 5>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He to died show.</v>

3676
02:44:57.710 --> 02:44:59.770
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's so gangster.</v>

3677
02:44:59.860 --> 02:45:02.380
<v Speaker 5>He's so good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was in New Zealand actually listening</v>

3678
02:45:02.381 --> 02:45:07.240
<v Speaker 5>to your epis to that episode at the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at the lounge in Oakland airport,</v>

3679
02:45:07.241 --> 02:45:09.520
<v Speaker 5>coming back to Australia a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 5>months ago.</v>

3680
02:45:09.730 --> 02:45:12.970
<v Speaker 5>And Henry was really inspiring to me in</v>
<v Speaker 5>that episode because it made me realize</v>

3681
02:45:12.971 --> 02:45:13.781
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3682
02:45:13.781 --> 02:45:16.810
<v Speaker 5>just because I'm getting old and like</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to be a dad and everything</v>

3683
02:45:16.811 --> 02:45:18.790
<v Speaker 5>doesn't mean you have to lose your sense</v>
<v Speaker 5>of adventure.</v>

3684
02:45:18.791 --> 02:45:22.090
<v Speaker 5>That dude is bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's got a hundred percent sense of</v>

3685
02:45:22.091 --> 02:45:24.130
<v Speaker 5>adventure to the point where he won't</v>
<v Speaker 5>have a relationship.</v>

3686
02:45:24.640 --> 02:45:25.480
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not,</v>

3687
02:45:25.510 --> 02:45:27.340
<v Speaker 5>it's not worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just too much work.</v>

3688
02:45:27.520 --> 02:45:31.480
<v Speaker 5>But he's also an interesting case study</v>
<v Speaker 5>in giving kids medication,</v>

3689
02:45:31.481 --> 02:45:34.300
<v Speaker 5>a very early age.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was one of the very early Prozac</v>

3690
02:45:34.301 --> 02:45:35.410
<v Speaker 5>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh really?</v>

3691
02:45:35.440 --> 02:45:36.630
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They are Ritalin rather.</v>

3692
02:45:36.810 --> 02:45:37.643
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they hooked him up.</v>

3693
02:45:37.690 --> 02:45:40.090
<v Speaker 5>They hooked him up with Ritalin when he</v>
<v Speaker 5>was fucking five years old,</v>

3694
02:45:40.091 --> 02:45:43.200
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>from five years old to high school.</v>

3695
02:45:43.280 --> 02:45:45.040
<v Speaker 5>How does he feel about that now?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Terrible.</v>

3696
02:45:45.041 --> 02:45:47.440
<v Speaker 5>I mean he just described it like it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>horrible,</v>

3697
02:45:47.441 --> 02:45:50.620
<v Speaker 5>like he's white knuckled his way through</v>
<v Speaker 5>the day and the end of the day the</v>

3698
02:45:50.621 --> 02:45:54.160
<v Speaker 5>Ritalin would wear off and he'd be</v>
<v Speaker 5>exhausted and we'd go through class.</v>

3699
02:45:55.600 --> 02:45:59.740
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's a good chunk of his</v>
<v Speaker 5>intense personality and behavior has to</v>

3700
02:45:59.741 --> 02:46:02.240
<v Speaker 5>do with him being raised on speed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3701
02:46:02.690 --> 02:46:05.200
<v Speaker 5>just crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's funny how it has a different impact</v>

3702
02:46:05.201 --> 02:46:07.390
<v Speaker 5>on people who have add and then people</v>
<v Speaker 5>who don't.</v>

3703
02:46:07.530 --> 02:46:08.590
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't us.</v>

3704
02:46:08.640 --> 02:46:09.980
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well what is add,</v>

3705
02:46:10.040 --> 02:46:11.210
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a real thing,</v>

3706
02:46:11.211 --> 02:46:15.350
<v Speaker 5>but how does it manifest itself in a</v>
<v Speaker 5>person and how does it manifest in a</v>

3707
02:46:15.351 --> 02:46:20.351
<v Speaker 5>person that is formed in this</v>
<v Speaker 5>environment where they're forced to be</v>

3708
02:46:20.721 --> 02:46:24.530
<v Speaker 5>in is a rigid,</v>
<v Speaker 5>controlled social experiment called</v>

3709
02:46:24.531 --> 02:46:25.800
<v Speaker 5>school.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>

3710
02:46:25.860 --> 02:46:27.950
<v Speaker 5>And why do we have classroom?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why don't we,</v>

3711
02:46:28.070 --> 02:46:31.490
<v Speaker 5>it has to be 30 people and they all have</v>
<v Speaker 5>to be sitting in a row.</v>

3712
02:46:31.580 --> 02:46:34.910
<v Speaker 5>And then he said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>program you to have a regular job that</v>

3713
02:46:34.911 --> 02:46:35.860
<v Speaker 5>you don't have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3714
02:46:35.870 --> 02:46:37.370
<v Speaker 5>I don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he doesn't have,</v>

3715
02:46:37.580 --> 02:46:40.700
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of people that don't have</v>
<v Speaker 5>jobs where you have to work in a fucking</v>

3716
02:46:40.701 --> 02:46:41.270
<v Speaker 5>cubicle.</v>

3717
02:46:41.270 --> 02:46:42.860
<v Speaker 5>Well that's one thing that I assumed we</v>
<v Speaker 5>would have.</v>

3718
02:46:42.861 --> 02:46:44.960
<v Speaker 5>We would have gotten to today,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which I'm surprised we didn't,</v>

3719
02:46:44.961 --> 02:46:47.750
<v Speaker 5>which is like the rise of automation and</v>
<v Speaker 5>robotics and stuff.</v>

3720
02:46:47.751 --> 02:46:48.620
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>millions.</v>

3721
02:46:48.621 --> 02:46:51.740
<v Speaker 5>How many millions of Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's the largest,</v>

3722
02:46:51.741 --> 02:46:56.741
<v Speaker 5>the largest employment sector full</v>
<v Speaker 5>working class males is driving self</v>

3723
02:46:57.501 --> 02:46:59.060
<v Speaker 5>driving cars.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It just around the bloody corner.</v>

3724
02:46:59.061 --> 02:47:01.970
<v Speaker 5>What's going to happen to the millions</v>
<v Speaker 5>of Americans who make a living driving</v>

3725
02:47:01.971 --> 02:47:04.730
<v Speaker 5>trucks?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The big solution to that that a lot of</v>

3726
02:47:04.731 --> 02:47:07.130
<v Speaker 5>people bring up is universal basic</v>
<v Speaker 5>income,</v>

3727
02:47:07.430 --> 02:47:09.380
<v Speaker 5>but universal basic income,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3728
02:47:09.620 --> 02:47:11.360
<v Speaker 5>you know there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's people that have a problem with</v>

3729
02:47:11.361 --> 02:47:15.260
<v Speaker 5>that because they believe that people</v>
<v Speaker 5>are only motivated by want and then as</v>

3730
02:47:15.261 --> 02:47:17.720
<v Speaker 5>soon as you give them money,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then they're not going to just pursue</v>

3731
02:47:17.721 --> 02:47:19.100
<v Speaker 5>their interest.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're going to lay around and do</v>

3732
02:47:19.101 --> 02:47:21.950
<v Speaker 5>nothing and just live off of that money</v>
<v Speaker 5>only.</v>

3733
02:47:22.130 --> 02:47:22.431
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3734
02:47:22.431 --> 02:47:25.760
<v Speaker 5>and this also the question of whether or</v>
<v Speaker 5>not that's right or wrong and comes back</v>

3735
02:47:25.761 --> 02:47:28.610
<v Speaker 5>to America's sort of puritan work work</v>
<v Speaker 5>ethic as well,</v>

3736
02:47:28.611 --> 02:47:30.920
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The idea that it would necessarily be</v>

3737
02:47:30.921 --> 02:47:33.530
<v Speaker 5>wrong for a person not to be doing</v>
<v Speaker 5>something productive,</v>

3738
02:47:34.100 --> 02:47:37.280
<v Speaker 5>but like if the robots are doing all the</v>
<v Speaker 5>work and they're producing lots of</v>

3739
02:47:37.281 --> 02:47:39.290
<v Speaker 5>wealth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then who cares if someone's doing</v>

3740
02:47:39.291 --> 02:47:40.740
<v Speaker 5>something productive or not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

3741
02:47:40.790 --> 02:47:43.790
<v Speaker 5>We're worried that they're going to get</v>
<v Speaker 5>mad at the people like you that are out</v>

3742
02:47:43.791 --> 02:47:45.260
<v Speaker 5>there being ambitious and they're gonna</v>
<v Speaker 5>kill me.</v>

3743
02:47:45.261 --> 02:47:47.310
<v Speaker 5>Mercedes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well maybe I would sometimes not do</v>

3744
02:47:47.311 --> 02:47:49.460
<v Speaker 5>anything as well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm Australian.</v>

3745
02:47:49.461 --> 02:47:52.100
<v Speaker 5>What criminals?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We have a saying that,</v>

3746
02:47:52.370 --> 02:47:55.670
<v Speaker 5>thank God we were convicted by Woo,</v>
<v Speaker 5>thank God we were settled by convicts</v>

3747
02:47:55.671 --> 02:47:58.160
<v Speaker 5>instead of by Puritans to well it's a</v>
<v Speaker 5>good point.</v>

3748
02:47:58.460 --> 02:48:01.070
<v Speaker 5>I mean we've,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we've fighting off the echoes of those</v>

3749
02:48:01.071 --> 02:48:04.400
<v Speaker 5>fucking ridiculous instincts from the</v>
<v Speaker 5>puritans Atlanta to here.</v>

3750
02:48:04.760 --> 02:48:07.820
<v Speaker 5>We're still fighting that off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's a big part of what America</v>

3751
02:48:07.821 --> 02:48:08.654
<v Speaker 5>is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3752
02:48:08.660 --> 02:48:11.360
<v Speaker 5>I think that would be a big impediment</v>
<v Speaker 5>to universal basic income.</v>

3753
02:48:11.420 --> 02:48:14.240
<v Speaker 5>The set,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this puritan sense of justice that there</v>

3754
02:48:14.241 --> 02:48:19.241
<v Speaker 5>is justice and also</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think maybe people just want work.</v>

3755
02:48:20.720 --> 02:48:23.840
<v Speaker 5>They want purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like the people who were retrenched have</v>

3756
02:48:23.841 --> 02:48:26.660
<v Speaker 5>purpose as well as universal basic</v>
<v Speaker 5>income.</v>

3757
02:48:27.010 --> 02:48:30.410
<v Speaker 5>You would have to sort of program it</v>
<v Speaker 5>into the Zeitgeists of the culture,</v>

3758
02:48:30.530 --> 02:48:34.040
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And give people what voluntary ways of</v>

3759
02:48:34.790 --> 02:48:38.570
<v Speaker 5>expressing themselves and contributing</v>
<v Speaker 5>that weren't tied to their income.</v>

3760
02:48:38.840 --> 02:48:41.810
<v Speaker 5>Encourage people to pursue actual</v>
<v Speaker 5>interests.</v>

3761
02:48:41.930 --> 02:48:45.650
<v Speaker 5>Like say if you gave people universal</v>
<v Speaker 5>basic income and encourage them to</v>

3762
02:48:45.651 --> 02:48:48.690
<v Speaker 5>pursue artistic venues or ventures,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3763
02:48:48.890 --> 02:48:52.220
<v Speaker 5>whether it's a writing or painting or</v>
<v Speaker 5>whenever the fuck it is.</v>

3764
02:48:52.510 --> 02:48:53.151
<v Speaker 5>And you say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

3765
02:48:53.151 --> 02:48:55.280
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of merit in that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you and you can do this.</v>

3766
02:48:55.280 --> 02:48:56.810
<v Speaker 5>Your food is bought you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have,</v>

3767
02:48:56.840 --> 02:48:59.870
<v Speaker 5>you have a home,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can eat and you can sleep.</v>

3768
02:48:59.900 --> 02:49:02.270
<v Speaker 5>You have a roof over your head now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do what you want.</v>

3769
02:49:02.300 --> 02:49:04.010
<v Speaker 5>What do you want to do?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it'd be a fence.</v>

3770
02:49:04.050 --> 02:49:06.710
<v Speaker 5>It's a fantastic experiment and I'm glad</v>
<v Speaker 5>that there are a few little</v>

3771
02:49:06.720 --> 02:49:10.140
<v Speaker 5>jurisdictions in Scandinavia and Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which seem to be trying it out because</v>

3772
02:49:10.141 --> 02:49:12.430
<v Speaker 5>I'd be interested to know how many,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like there are,</v>

3773
02:49:12.600 --> 02:49:14.760
<v Speaker 5>you could,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could imagine different groupings of</v>

3774
02:49:14.761 --> 02:49:18.060
<v Speaker 5>human psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like some people will be like,</v>

3775
02:49:18.630 --> 02:49:20.700
<v Speaker 5>awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't have to worry about making</v>

3776
02:49:20.701 --> 02:49:22.620
<v Speaker 5>money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to become the greatest</v>

3777
02:49:22.720 --> 02:49:24.000
<v Speaker 5>artisinal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3778
02:49:24.330 --> 02:49:27.180
<v Speaker 5>furniture maker that I can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's fantastic.</v>

3779
02:49:27.390 --> 02:49:28.470
<v Speaker 5>And then at the other end of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>spectrum,</v>

3780
02:49:28.471 --> 02:49:29.910
<v Speaker 5>there'll be people who are like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sweet,</v>

3781
02:49:29.911 --> 02:49:31.680
<v Speaker 5>don't have to work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I'm just going to sit at home.</v>

3782
02:49:31.710 --> 02:49:32.830
<v Speaker 5>That's fine too day.</v>

3783
02:49:33.180 --> 02:49:36.900
<v Speaker 5>What else be that crime rates lower</v>
<v Speaker 5>because of that.</v>

3784
02:49:36.930 --> 02:49:39.510
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure that's what we should be hoping</v>

3785
02:49:39.511 --> 02:49:42.060
<v Speaker 5>for it and the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the real good argument for universal</v>

3786
02:49:42.061 --> 02:49:46.110
<v Speaker 5>basic income is that the money that you</v>
<v Speaker 5>spend giving people certain universal</v>

3787
02:49:46.111 --> 02:49:50.370
<v Speaker 5>basic income you would save money from</v>
<v Speaker 5>people going to jail,</v>

3788
02:49:50.400 --> 02:49:54.180
<v Speaker 5>juvenile detention,</v>
<v Speaker 5>medical issues,</v>

3789
02:49:54.480 --> 02:49:57.180
<v Speaker 5>all sorts of issues that come out of</v>
<v Speaker 5>poverty.</v>

3790
02:49:57.600 --> 02:50:00.450
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of issues that come out of</v>
<v Speaker 5>poverty that are directly connected to</v>

3791
02:50:00.451 --> 02:50:00.931
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3792
02:50:00.931 --> 02:50:02.730
<v Speaker 5>This is one of the arguments for welfare</v>
<v Speaker 5>as well.</v>

3793
02:50:02.731 --> 02:50:06.030
<v Speaker 5>I mean people who say that it wouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 5>have any impact on crime.</v>

3794
02:50:06.330 --> 02:50:09.630
<v Speaker 5>I would just say look at the different</v>
<v Speaker 5>countries in the world that have more or</v>

3795
02:50:09.631 --> 02:50:13.860
<v Speaker 5>less generous welfare systems and the</v>
<v Speaker 5>ones with more generous welfare systems</v>

3796
02:50:13.980 --> 02:50:18.210
<v Speaker 5>do tend to be more peaceful places.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There might be other reasons as well.</v>

3797
02:50:18.850 --> 02:50:22.890
<v Speaker 5>I think they're correlated and I think</v>
<v Speaker 5>also one of the things that I try to do,</v>

3798
02:50:22.950 --> 02:50:27.950
<v Speaker 5>I really try to support people who make</v>
<v Speaker 5>things and make things by hand.</v>

3799
02:50:28.380 --> 02:50:32.610
<v Speaker 5>People companies that like make stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like when people make stuff.</v>

3800
02:50:32.611 --> 02:50:35.520
<v Speaker 5>I like when when people pursue like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like this,</v>

3801
02:50:36.090 --> 02:50:37.740
<v Speaker 5>this tables,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean by an artist,</v>

3802
02:50:37.770 --> 02:50:41.220
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like when people make handmade knives.</v>

3803
02:50:41.221 --> 02:50:43.370
<v Speaker 5>I'd like that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the more API,</v>

3804
02:50:43.440 --> 02:50:46.710
<v Speaker 5>I think people get deep satisfaction in</v>
<v Speaker 5>doing things like that.</v>

3805
02:50:46.950 --> 02:50:49.300
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I'm Russell Bill,</v>

3806
02:50:49.301 --> 02:50:52.230
<v Speaker 5>the guy made that clock right there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a handmaid clock.</v>

3807
02:50:52.231 --> 02:50:54.670
<v Speaker 5>That dude built that fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That one.</v>

3808
02:50:55.290 --> 02:50:57.330
<v Speaker 5>This tgg studios.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It built that right there.</v>

3809
02:50:57.331 --> 02:51:01.050
<v Speaker 5>That's a handmade clock too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I tried to support that shit as much as</v>

3810
02:51:01.051 --> 02:51:03.930
<v Speaker 5>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that that is the future.</v>

3811
02:51:04.300 --> 02:51:05.390
<v Speaker 5>The there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>

3812
02:51:05.490 --> 02:51:07.860
<v Speaker 5>when I look at that clock,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know a guy made that.</v>

3813
02:51:07.890 --> 02:51:09.240
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that means something to me.</v>

3814
02:51:09.241 --> 02:51:10.180
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's cool.</v>

3815
02:51:10.181 --> 02:51:12.350
<v Speaker 5>It's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is also a really cool looking at,</v>

3816
02:51:12.720 --> 02:51:16.240
<v Speaker 5>if you asked me to make a clock,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wouldn't know where to start.</v>

3817
02:51:16.560 --> 02:51:18.210
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you would figure it out.</v>

3818
02:51:18.510 --> 02:51:21.450
<v Speaker 5>I would if you gave them the books and</v>
<v Speaker 5>all that stuff,</v>

3819
02:51:21.451 --> 02:51:23.820
<v Speaker 5>but you might,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it might not be a clock for you and</v>

3820
02:51:23.821 --> 02:51:24.510
<v Speaker 5>Maggie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3821
02:51:24.510 --> 02:51:25.920
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that Buddhist sculpture.</v>

3822
02:51:25.921 --> 02:51:27.690
<v Speaker 5>Somebody made that and send it to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's great.</v>

3823
02:51:27.691 --> 02:51:30.660
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's a lot of things that</v>
<v Speaker 5>people can make that other people would</v>

3824
02:51:30.661 --> 02:51:34.080
<v Speaker 5>enjoy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think our teasel goods and</v>

3825
02:51:34.081 --> 02:51:38.430
<v Speaker 5>services and things that people do that</v>
<v Speaker 5>are hand crafted,</v>

3826
02:51:38.431 --> 02:51:42.330
<v Speaker 5>they have a special meaning to them that</v>
<v Speaker 5>people they value.</v>

3827
02:51:42.570 --> 02:51:44.370
<v Speaker 5>I wonder if there's something that's</v>
<v Speaker 5>mass produced.</v>

3828
02:51:44.371 --> 02:51:48.390
<v Speaker 5>I wonder if enough people can find self</v>
<v Speaker 5>expression through that to counteract</v>

3829
02:51:48.420 --> 02:51:52.170
<v Speaker 5>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the job losses that are resulting from</v>

3830
02:51:52.180 --> 02:51:55.350
<v Speaker 5>and will continue to result from</v>
<v Speaker 5>technological advance.</v>

3831
02:51:55.470 --> 02:51:58.140
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that with universal basic income</v>

3832
02:51:58.200 --> 02:52:01.110
<v Speaker 5>is possible,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think making things is not</v>

3833
02:52:01.111 --> 02:52:03.040
<v Speaker 5>necessarily the only way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's,</v>

3834
02:52:03.320 --> 02:52:05.500
<v Speaker 5>it has making art,</v>
<v Speaker 5>being creative,</v>

3835
02:52:05.530 --> 02:52:06.190
<v Speaker 5>encouraging</v>

3836
02:52:06.190 --> 02:52:08.500
<v Speaker 1>people to think of that as an actual way</v>
<v Speaker 1>to live.</v>

3837
02:52:08.520 --> 02:52:10.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a big,</v>

3838
02:52:10.540 --> 02:52:14.040
<v Speaker 1>that's a big impediment and a big hurdle</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get over it.</v>

3839
02:52:14.041 --> 02:52:15.610
<v Speaker 1>It's like the North Korea thing that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>were saying,</v>

3840
02:52:15.611 --> 02:52:17.590
<v Speaker 1>like if you got rid of the North Korean</v>
<v Speaker 1>regime,</v>

3841
02:52:17.591 --> 02:52:20.050
<v Speaker 1>would the people who lived under it have</v>
<v Speaker 1>the scope,</v>

3842
02:52:20.110 --> 02:52:23.530
<v Speaker 1>have the just a mental scope to know</v>
<v Speaker 1>what to do with themselves?</v>

3843
02:52:23.531 --> 02:52:26.620
<v Speaker 1>In some ways it's a comparable question</v>
<v Speaker 1>with capitalism,</v>

3844
02:52:26.621 --> 02:52:28.030
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you took away the capitalist</v>

3845
02:52:28.031 --> 02:52:31.180
<v Speaker 1>incentive to work and suddenly all of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sudden everybody was liberated and had a</v>

3846
02:52:31.181 --> 02:52:34.690
<v Speaker 1>basic income that that gave them all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sustenance that they need.</v>

3847
02:52:35.230 --> 02:52:37.660
<v Speaker 1>Would they have the horizons available</v>

<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

3871
02:53:22.691 --> 02:53:24.940
<v Speaker 1>of bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also you have expectations</v>

02:53:24.941 --> 02:53:27.190
<v Speaker 1>immediately after winning that things</v>
<v Speaker 1>are going to get a lot better.</v>

3873
02:53:27.700 --> 02:53:32.380
<v Speaker 1>As you know from anyone who has paid</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to there the process of their</v>

3874
02:53:32.381 --> 02:53:34.570
<v Speaker 1>own consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether that's through psychedelics or</v>

3875
02:53:34.571 --> 02:53:37.360
<v Speaker 1>flotation tanks or you know what Sam</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harris and Dan Harris,</v>

3876
02:53:37.361 --> 02:53:39.550
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about recently about</v>
<v Speaker 1>meditation.</v>

3877
02:53:39.880 --> 02:53:43.300
<v Speaker 1>Your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your conscious perception of life is not</v>

3878
02:53:43.870 --> 02:53:48.870
<v Speaker 1>determined by what's going on outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is trivially occasionally and like</v>

3879
02:53:49.001 --> 02:53:51.940
<v Speaker 1>into like for in the short term,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the long term,</v>

3880
02:53:51.941 --> 02:53:54.880
<v Speaker 1>your actual happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it comes from within.</v>

3881
02:53:55.090 --> 02:53:58.060
<v Speaker 1>But people always take the path of least</v>
<v Speaker 1>resistance.</v>

3882
02:53:58.061 --> 02:54:01.090
<v Speaker 1>And oftentimes the path of least</v>
<v Speaker 1>resistance is these patterns that we've</v>

3883
02:54:01.091 --> 02:54:04.420
<v Speaker 1>carved into our behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these behavior patterns that we've</v>

3884
02:54:04.421 --> 02:54:08.650
<v Speaker 1>carved into our psyche.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of times those aren't even the</v>

3885
02:54:08.651 --> 02:54:11.350
<v Speaker 1>path of least resistance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They become the path of more resistance,</v>

3886
02:54:11.560 --> 02:54:15.580
<v Speaker 1>but we're so accustomed to those paths</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we think of them and treat them as</v>

3887
02:54:15.581 --> 02:54:17.390
<v Speaker 1>if they're the right path.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

3888
02:54:18.700 --> 02:54:21.220
<v Speaker 1>Mind blown.</v>

3890
02:54:24.131 --> 02:54:26.860
<v Speaker 1>There's no answers in North Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't figure out shit.</v>

3891
02:54:27.310 --> 02:54:30.430
<v Speaker 1>It's not the point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe Pine to figure it out.</v>
