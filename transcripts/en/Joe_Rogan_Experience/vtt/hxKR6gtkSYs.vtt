1
00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:06.050
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches 30 the last time I sat a exactly 30 last time I had a three</v>

2
00:00:06.991 --> 00:00:07.824
<v Speaker 1>month retreat.</v>

3
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:08.783
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:09.690
<v Speaker 1>but he's just got you,</v>

5
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.010
<v Speaker 1>you're unplugging from your life.</v>

6
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.990
<v Speaker 1>You're saying goodbye to everyone,</v>

7
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:13.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

8
00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:14.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

9
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:14.220
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

10
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:14.491
<v Speaker 1>for all,</v>

11
00:00:14.491 --> 00:00:16.380
<v Speaker 1>you know someone's going to die while you're on retreat.</v>

12
00:00:16.381 --> 00:00:21.270
<v Speaker 1>And so there's this real discontinuity with every project and every aspiration</v>

13
00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:22.800
<v Speaker 1>and everything you have going on.</v>

14
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.143
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

15
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:25.373
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

16
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.350
<v Speaker 1>and also most of the people in your life can't believe you're doing this.</v>

17
00:00:28.351 --> 00:00:28.541
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

18
00:00:28.541 --> 00:00:29.640
<v Speaker 1>there's not much support.</v>

19
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:29.900
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

20
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.110
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's just totally inscrutable.</v>

21
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

22
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.870
<v Speaker 1>That you would decide to do this and then you'll essentially lock yourself in a</v>

23
00:00:36.871 --> 00:00:37.321
<v Speaker 1>closet.</v>

24
00:00:37.321 --> 00:00:37.491
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

25
00:00:37.491 --> 00:00:37.641
<v Speaker 1>a lot.</v>

26
00:00:37.641 --> 00:00:39.630
<v Speaker 1>You essentially lock yourself in a room as big as,</v>

27
00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:40.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

28
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.010
<v Speaker 1>these two tables and then you're just left with your thoughts.</v>

29
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.350
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

30
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.260
<v Speaker 1>the problem is,</v>

31
00:00:48.261 --> 00:00:50.130
<v Speaker 1>is that just thinking itself,</v>

32
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.670
<v Speaker 1>even thinking happy thoughts is stressful at when you,</v>

33
00:00:53.671 --> 00:00:54.151
<v Speaker 1>when you actually,</v>

34
00:00:54.151 --> 00:00:55.620
<v Speaker 1>when you really start paying attention to it,</v>

35
00:00:55.621 --> 00:00:55.721
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

36
00:00:55.721 --> 00:00:58.950
<v Speaker 1>that just the sheer automaticity of it to just,</v>

37
00:00:58.951 --> 00:00:59.761
<v Speaker 1>just to be,</v>

38
00:00:59.761 --> 00:01:02.340
<v Speaker 1>just to not be able to stop the conversation.</v>

39
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.700
<v Speaker 1>And he just can't stop talking to yourself for a second.</v>

40
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.130
<v Speaker 1>And that now you eventually you can eventually you become concentrated on,</v>

41
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.470
<v Speaker 1>in this case,</v>

42
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:12.721
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

43
00:01:12.721 --> 00:01:12.871
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

44
00:01:12.871 --> 00:01:14.760
<v Speaker 1>the practice I was doing as it's called Vipassana,</v>

45
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.800
<v Speaker 1>which is mindfulness meditation and the practice there is just to become very</v>

46
00:01:19.801 --> 00:01:21.210
<v Speaker 1>keenly aware of,</v>

47
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

48
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.660
<v Speaker 1>you start with the breath as an object of meditation.</v>

49
00:01:24.661 --> 00:01:25.080
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

50
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.610
<v Speaker 1>but once you get a little concentration,</v>

51
00:01:26.611 --> 00:01:27.750
<v Speaker 1>you opened it up to everything.</v>

52
00:01:27.751 --> 00:01:32.751
<v Speaker 1>So sounds and sensations and even thoughts themselves become objects of</v>

53
00:01:32.851 --> 00:01:36.810
<v Speaker 1>meditation where you're just noticing whatever arises in consciousness and,</v>

54
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.800
<v Speaker 1>but the difference between noticing the thought arise and pass away and being</v>

55
00:01:40.801 --> 00:01:42.030
<v Speaker 1>lost in thought is,</v>

56
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.460
<v Speaker 1>is huge and this is the all important difference.</v>

57
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.450
<v Speaker 1>And it takes some real concentration to act,</v>

58
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.310
<v Speaker 1>to see a thought arise and pass away because without the concentration,</v>

59
00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:54.840
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden the thoughts just you,</v>

60
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.310
<v Speaker 1>it just comes up from behind in a way and you are just,</v>

61
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.323
<v Speaker 1>you're just,</v>

62
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.420
<v Speaker 1>you feel identical in,</v>

63
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.240
<v Speaker 1>in a strange way.</v>

64
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.870
<v Speaker 1>You feel identical to this sentence in your head.</v>

65
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:07.170
<v Speaker 1>You Do,</v>

66
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.010
<v Speaker 1>you feel there's miss thoughts are just sentences and images.</v>

67
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.401
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

68
00:02:11.401 --> 00:02:11.550
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

69
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.990
<v Speaker 1>when you actually look at what a thought is,</v>

70
00:02:12.991 --> 00:02:13.111
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

71
00:02:13.111 --> 00:02:14.640
<v Speaker 1>it's very hard to see how you could,</v>

72
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.460
<v Speaker 1>how could ever define your subjectivity in the first place.</v>

73
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.490
<v Speaker 1>It's just like mere thoughts are no more substantial than the sound of my voice.</v>

74
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.380
<v Speaker 1>And you're just hearing the sound of my voice as a kind of appearance and</v>

75
00:02:25.381 --> 00:02:26.400
<v Speaker 1>consciousness right now.</v>

76
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:27.563
<v Speaker 1>And it's not,</v>

77
00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.340
<v Speaker 1>it's not defining you.</v>

78
00:02:29.341 --> 00:02:29.611
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

79
00:02:29.611 --> 00:02:30.750
<v Speaker 1>you don't feel identical to it.</v>

80
00:02:30.751 --> 00:02:33.660
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have a real implication so much for how you feel.</v>

81
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.883
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

82
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.760
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

83
00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:36.593
<v Speaker 1>you're not,</v>

84
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.073
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

85
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.050
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

86
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.430
<v Speaker 1>it's easy to see or to in this case here that it is a,</v>

87
00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.410
<v Speaker 1>an just an appearance in consciousness.</v>

88
00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.030
<v Speaker 1>It comes and it goes,</v>

89
00:02:48.031 --> 00:02:49.170
<v Speaker 1>it starts and it stops.</v>

90
00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.180
<v Speaker 1>And it's all sort of in plain view.</v>

91
00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.900
<v Speaker 1>But with your own thoughts with the w w with your own voice,</v>

92
00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:56.610
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

93
00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.130
<v Speaker 1>it sneaks up on you in a way that is,</v>

94
00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.040
<v Speaker 1>and even to use</v>

95
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.370
<v Speaker 2>the word you in this case is a little misleading because it,</v>

96
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.760
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>

97
00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.760
<v Speaker 2>it colors consciousness and trims it down in such a way that it just feels like</v>

98
00:03:08.291 --> 00:03:09.100
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

99
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.371
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't,</v>

100
00:03:09.371 --> 00:03:10.310
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't feel it does it,</v>

101
00:03:10.311 --> 00:03:10.551
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

102
00:03:10.551 --> 00:03:11.140
<v Speaker 2>it's you,</v>

103
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.973
<v Speaker 2>you feel,</v>

104
00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean the feeling of being a self,</v>

105
00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:16.090
<v Speaker 2>the feeling that we call I,</v>

106
00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:21.070
<v Speaker 2>the feeling of being an ego in the head is what it feels like to be thinking</v>

107
00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:22.840
<v Speaker 2>without knowing that you're thinking.</v>

108
00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.321
<v Speaker 2>It's the,</v>

109
00:03:23.321 --> 00:03:25.900
<v Speaker 2>it's the feeling of this next thought.</v>

110
00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.880
<v Speaker 2>Capturing consciousness.</v>

111
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.830
<v Speaker 2>So when you say that thoughts,</v>

112
00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.340
<v Speaker 2>you are identical to thought.</v>

113
00:03:31.341 --> 00:03:34.090
<v Speaker 2>So if you're thinking something really fucked up like a,</v>

114
00:03:34.091 --> 00:03:34.901
<v Speaker 2>I'm fat,</v>

115
00:03:34.901 --> 00:03:35.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm a loser,</v>

116
00:03:35.801 --> 00:03:37.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm always going to be a loser.</v>

117
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:41.470
<v Speaker 2>Like that is identical to who you are because you are sort of framing yourself</v>

118
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.190
<v Speaker 2>in this thought that these thoughts that you're carrying around in your mind,</v>

119
00:03:45.191 --> 00:03:47.860
<v Speaker 2>they are what's occupying your consciousness.</v>

120
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.270
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>

121
00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.470
<v Speaker 2>if those thoughts are on the forefront of your consciousness,</v>

122
00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.300
<v Speaker 2>that they identify you,</v>

123
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:52.961
<v Speaker 2>you are,</v>

124
00:03:52.961 --> 00:03:56.350
<v Speaker 2>that you are those thoughts and you are identical to that idea.</v>

125
00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.861
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

126
00:03:56.861 --> 00:03:57.191
<v Speaker 2>And their,</v>

127
00:03:57.191 --> 00:04:00.640
<v Speaker 2>and their driving behavior and they're driving emotion and they're driving each</v>

128
00:04:00.641 --> 00:04:02.710
<v Speaker 2>subsequent train of thought.</v>

129
00:04:02.711 --> 00:04:03.341
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

130
00:04:03.341 --> 00:04:03.670
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

131
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.670
<v Speaker 2>it's determining the future expressions of your consciousness and your body as</v>

132
00:04:09.521 --> 00:04:09.791
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

133
00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:10.330
<v Speaker 2>So you're,</v>

134
00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:11.050
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

135
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.381
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>

136
00:04:11.381 --> 00:04:11.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

137
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm not separating the mind from the body here.</v>

138
00:04:14.171 --> 00:04:15.004
<v Speaker 2>I mean all of this is,</v>

139
00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.250
<v Speaker 2>we could talk about this in terms of events in the brain as well,</v>

140
00:04:18.251 --> 00:04:21.860
<v Speaker 2>but it's much easier to talk about it in terms of our first person experience</v>

141
00:04:21.861 --> 00:04:24.880
<v Speaker 2>has thoughts and moods and emotions,</v>

142
00:04:24.881 --> 00:04:25.300
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>

143
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.010
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

144
00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.770
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

145
00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.981
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

146
00:04:26.981 --> 00:04:27.490
<v Speaker 2>for the,</v>

147
00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:28.690
<v Speaker 2>for the purpose of this argument,</v>

148
00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:29.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

149
00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.930
<v Speaker 2>there's no doubt that the brain is doing this.</v>

150
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:33.070
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

151
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.510
<v Speaker 2>we're not that side of the story as much less to say about that side of the</v>

152
00:04:37.511 --> 00:04:38.320
<v Speaker 2>story at the moment.</v>

153
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.640
<v Speaker 2>And it's not clean is doing it,</v>

154
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.930
<v Speaker 2>but you're,</v>

155
00:04:40.931 --> 00:04:42.190
<v Speaker 2>you're whatever it is,</v>

156
00:04:42.191 --> 00:04:43.001
<v Speaker 2>your personality,</v>

157
00:04:43.001 --> 00:04:43.801
<v Speaker 2>your consciousness,</v>

158
00:04:43.801 --> 00:04:44.051
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

159
00:04:44.051 --> 00:04:48.010
<v Speaker 2>your center is sort of what guides the brain one way or another.</v>

160
00:04:48.011 --> 00:04:50.050
<v Speaker 2>Like it is possible to,</v>

161
00:04:50.051 --> 00:04:52.060
<v Speaker 2>while in the middle of having these thoughts and say,</v>

162
00:04:52.061 --> 00:04:52.480
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

163
00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm not gonna entertain these anymore and I'm going to think about something</v>

164
00:04:56.021 --> 00:04:56.500
<v Speaker 2>positive.</v>

165
00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:57.790
<v Speaker 2>But it's very difficult.</v>

166
00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:58.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

167
00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:59.560
<v Speaker 2>Surprisingly difficult.</v>

168
00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.070
<v Speaker 2>Even as someone like myself who's spent a lot of times,</v>

169
00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.300
<v Speaker 2>a lot of time meditating,</v>

170
00:05:04.301 --> 00:05:06.460
<v Speaker 2>especially a lot of time in isolation tanks,</v>

171
00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:07.210
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

172
00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.350
<v Speaker 2>it's still difficult every now and then if something's bothering you to just get</v>

173
00:05:11.351 --> 00:05:12.184
<v Speaker 2>it out of your head.</v>

174
00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:13.060
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

175
00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.200
<v Speaker 2>especially for me.</v>

176
00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:15.093
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

177
00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.680
<v Speaker 2>one of my main issues is my work.</v>

178
00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.611
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

179
00:05:18.611 --> 00:05:19.000
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

180
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.833
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

181
00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.580
<v Speaker 2>like standup comedy for instance.</v>

182
00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.180
<v Speaker 2>Like if I have a show and a I fuck a bit up.</v>

183
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:26.350
<v Speaker 2>If it goes wrong,</v>

184
00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.500
<v Speaker 2>like if I have two shows in a night and I fuck a bit up on the first show,</v>

185
00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:30.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm okay.</v>

186
00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.780
<v Speaker 2>If I could redo it on the second show,</v>

187
00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.740
<v Speaker 2>we're good.</v>

188
00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.960
<v Speaker 2>But if I fuck it up on the second show,</v>

189
00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:36.040
<v Speaker 2>God damn it.</v>

190
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.820
<v Speaker 2>Now I have to think about that thing all night and I'll try to let it go.</v>

191
00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:41.320
<v Speaker 2>I'll try to get it out of my head.</v>

192
00:05:41.321 --> 00:05:46.321
<v Speaker 2>But I rationalize it by saying the only reason why I've gotten so good is</v>

193
00:05:46.571 --> 00:05:50.140
<v Speaker 2>because of this crazy obsession that I have with getting it correct.</v>

194
00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:55.150
<v Speaker 2>And that when things go awry or when I go down a bad path,</v>

195
00:05:55.151 --> 00:05:56.920
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't quite pan out.</v>

196
00:05:56.921 --> 00:06:00.560
<v Speaker 2>And then I have to sort of restart the whole conversation on stage that,</v>

197
00:06:00.561 --> 00:06:01.880
<v Speaker 2>that uncomfortable moment.</v>

198
00:06:01.881 --> 00:06:06.500
<v Speaker 2>And then the subsequent uncomfortable recollection of that moment is the very</v>

199
00:06:06.501 --> 00:06:10.610
<v Speaker 2>motivation that's led me to be a good standup in the first place.</v>

200
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:12.290
<v Speaker 2>So I kind of rationalize it,</v>

201
00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:13.580
<v Speaker 2>but fuck man,</v>

202
00:06:13.581 --> 00:06:17.480
<v Speaker 2>when I'm eating dinner after a show and I just flubbed one word that fucks up a</v>

203
00:06:17.481 --> 00:06:17.960
<v Speaker 2>joke,</v>

204
00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.520
<v Speaker 2>I'll be in the middle of eating pancakes going,</v>

205
00:06:19.521 --> 00:06:20.354
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>

206
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:22.070
<v Speaker 2>I can't get it out of my head.</v>

207
00:06:22.071 --> 00:06:26.750
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter if a wonderful wife and a beautiful family and great friends</v>

208
00:06:26.751 --> 00:06:30.180
<v Speaker 2>and a fantastic job and a one wonder of just a fee,</v>

209
00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:31.490
<v Speaker 2>a dream life,</v>

210
00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:32.210
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter.</v>

211
00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:33.043
<v Speaker 2>I flubbed a word.</v>

212
00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:34.310
<v Speaker 2>You fucking idiot.</v>

213
00:06:34.311 --> 00:06:34.551
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

214
00:06:34.551 --> 00:06:36.020
<v Speaker 2>like while I'm cutting into my food.</v>

215
00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.903
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

216
00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:37.330
<v Speaker 1>well that,</v>

217
00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:37.910
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

218
00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:39.360
<v Speaker 1>that's an interesting moment because,</v>

219
00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:41.173
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

220
00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.130
<v Speaker 1>so there's a moment before the thought has arisen,</v>

221
00:06:44.131 --> 00:06:44.311
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

222
00:06:44.311 --> 00:06:47.280
<v Speaker 1>where you have not yet remembered the flip lines.</v>

223
00:06:47.281 --> 00:06:51.150
<v Speaker 1>So you're just cutting into your dinner and then it's it,</v>

224
00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:53.010
<v Speaker 1>it's an image or part image,</v>

225
00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.390
<v Speaker 1>part sentence,</v>

226
00:06:54.391 --> 00:06:54.781
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

227
00:06:54.781 --> 00:06:59.781
<v Speaker 1>There's some expression of thought that arises in consciousness and you are,</v>

228
00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:01.820
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

229
00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:02.970
<v Speaker 1>you do not,</v>

230
00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:04.620
<v Speaker 1>you do not witness it arise.</v>

231
00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:08.790
<v Speaker 1>It's not like it's a difference between seeing it,</v>

232
00:07:08.791 --> 00:07:11.490
<v Speaker 1>watching a movie and being totally lost in the movie.</v>

233
00:07:11.491 --> 00:07:14.250
<v Speaker 1>Forgetting that you're sitting in a room with a bunch of other people looking at</v>

234
00:07:14.251 --> 00:07:15.090
<v Speaker 1>light on a wall.</v>

235
00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:15.391
<v Speaker 1>You're just,</v>

236
00:07:15.391 --> 00:07:16.920
<v Speaker 1>you're totally captured by the movie.</v>

237
00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:20.520
<v Speaker 1>It's different between that and actually just seeing the screen,</v>

238
00:07:20.521 --> 00:07:21.420
<v Speaker 1>the light on the wall,</v>

239
00:07:21.421 --> 00:07:22.920
<v Speaker 1>hearing the sound of the projector,</v>

240
00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:23.810
<v Speaker 1>seeing,</v>

241
00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:24.230
<v Speaker 1>seeing,</v>

242
00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:26.730
<v Speaker 1>seeing the artifice and uh,</v>

243
00:07:26.731 --> 00:07:31.350
<v Speaker 1>it's possible to see thoughts just as essentially like a play of light on the</v>

244
00:07:31.351 --> 00:07:31.740
<v Speaker 1>wall.</v>

245
00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:32.370
<v Speaker 1>He just use,</v>

246
00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:34.770
<v Speaker 1>you see it before it captures you.</v>

247
00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.320
<v Speaker 1>And the difference is total.</v>

248
00:07:37.321 --> 00:07:38.640
<v Speaker 1>And it is kind of like,</v>

249
00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:44.780
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like playing a video game where you can now not get killed in the</v>

250
00:07:45.481 --> 00:07:47.130
<v Speaker 1>same spot over and over again.</v>

251
00:07:47.131 --> 00:07:51.000
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's like not losing in the same boss fight over and over again.</v>

252
00:07:51.001 --> 00:07:51.750
<v Speaker 1>Yet we,</v>

253
00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:55.620
<v Speaker 1>we lose in that same fight a thousand times a day.</v>

254
00:07:55.621 --> 00:07:58.890
<v Speaker 1>But when you can actually see thoughts for what they are,</v>

255
00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:03.060
<v Speaker 1>so the next time you flubbed a line and the next and the next time you recall</v>

256
00:08:03.061 --> 00:08:03.894
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

257
00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:05.480
<v Speaker 1>it's possible with an a,</v>

258
00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:05.881
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

259
00:08:05.881 --> 00:08:08.220
<v Speaker 1>it takes a certain degree of concentration to be able to do this,</v>

260
00:08:08.221 --> 00:08:11.670
<v Speaker 1>but concentration becomes kind of a native capacity.</v>

261
00:08:11.671 --> 00:08:12.241
<v Speaker 1>At a certain point.</v>

262
00:08:12.241 --> 00:08:13.740
<v Speaker 1>It's like Jujitsu or anything else.</v>

263
00:08:13.741 --> 00:08:13.870
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

264
00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:16.650
<v Speaker 1>you have certain skills and you don't really lose them.</v>

265
00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:17.923
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

266
00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:23.960
<v Speaker 1>then you can just see it and it just comes and it goes and it doesn't have an</v>

267
00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:25.410
<v Speaker 1>end and it's going,</v>

268
00:08:25.411 --> 00:08:25.981
<v Speaker 1>it's going,</v>

269
00:08:25.981 --> 00:08:26.910
<v Speaker 1>it's really gone.</v>

270
00:08:26.911 --> 00:08:27.141
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

271
00:08:27.141 --> 00:08:27.241
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

272
00:08:27.241 --> 00:08:29.610
<v Speaker 1>and it doesn't have the same emotional necessity.</v>

273
00:08:29.611 --> 00:08:32.250
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't trigger the same mental state.</v>

274
00:08:32.251 --> 00:08:37.251
<v Speaker 1>And now that's not to say that these negative mental states haven't had the,</v>

275
00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:42.720
<v Speaker 1>the benefit that you ascribe to them.</v>

276
00:08:42.721 --> 00:08:43.081
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

277
00:08:43.081 --> 00:08:46.860
<v Speaker 1>it could be that you are as good as you are because you were motivated to not</v>

278
00:08:46.861 --> 00:08:49.710
<v Speaker 1>embarrass yourself ever again because it felt so terrible.</v>

279
00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:50.041
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

280
00:08:50.041 --> 00:08:52.050
<v Speaker 1>So you hated this experience of flubbing align.</v>

281
00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:53.480
<v Speaker 1>You hated the memory of,</v>

282
00:08:53.481 --> 00:08:54.120
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

283
00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:54.620
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

284
00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:56.220
<v Speaker 1>and the of it the next day</v>

285
00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:57.360
<v Speaker 2>you hated what it did to your,</v>

286
00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.160
<v Speaker 2>your time with your family.</v>

287
00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:00.001
<v Speaker 2>And so he thought,</v>

288
00:09:00.001 --> 00:09:01.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm not even the next tour.</v>

289
00:09:01.861 --> 00:09:02.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get this.</v>

290
00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:03.151
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to,</v>

291
00:09:03.151 --> 00:09:04.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get up earlier.</v>

292
00:09:04.051 --> 00:09:04.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to work harder,</v>

293
00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:06.263
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>

294
00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:06.931
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

295
00:09:06.931 --> 00:09:07.111
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

296
00:09:07.111 --> 00:09:07.311
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

297
00:09:07.311 --> 00:09:08.130
<v Speaker 2>that's all part of the,</v>

298
00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:10.290
<v Speaker 2>the clockwork that's causing you to,</v>

299
00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:11.880
<v Speaker 2>to hone your craft.</v>

300
00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:13.253
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

301
00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:17.400
<v Speaker 2>but I would argue that a little mental suffering goes along way.</v>

302
00:09:17.401 --> 00:09:18.234
<v Speaker 2>I think we w you know,</v>

303
00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:21.330
<v Speaker 2>nine times out of 10 or 99 times out of a hundred,</v>

304
00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:25.440
<v Speaker 2>we suffer unnecessarily and there's no good comes from it.</v>

305
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:25.861
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

306
00:09:25.861 --> 00:09:25.931
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

307
00:09:25.931 --> 00:09:27.630
<v Speaker 2>it's not actually making us better people.</v>

308
00:09:27.631 --> 00:09:28.650
<v Speaker 2>It's making us more neurotic.</v>

309
00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:29.910
<v Speaker 2>People were more worried.</v>

310
00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:30.811
<v Speaker 2>We're worse.</v>

311
00:09:30.811 --> 00:09:33.670
<v Speaker 2>Husbands were worse fathers and,</v>

312
00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:34.560
<v Speaker 2>and it's time to,</v>

313
00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:36.500
<v Speaker 2>to break that spell and,</v>

314
00:09:36.501 --> 00:09:36.920
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

315
00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:37.441
<v Speaker 2>and then you can,</v>

316
00:09:37.441 --> 00:09:39.330
<v Speaker 2>you can selectively be as,</v>

317
00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:43.110
<v Speaker 2>as uptight and neurotic as you want,</v>

318
00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:44.080
<v Speaker 2>but you can,</v>

319
00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:47.250
<v Speaker 2>it gives you a kind of freedom to pick your,</v>

320
00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:47.851
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

321
00:09:47.851 --> 00:09:48.570
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

322
00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:52.530
<v Speaker 2>your priorities in a way rather than be captured by just whatever the next</v>

323
00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:53.610
<v Speaker 2>thought happens to be.</v>

324
00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.010
<v Speaker 2>I've also found for me personally,</v>

325
00:09:56.011 --> 00:09:58.910
<v Speaker 2>the discipline and diligence or the,</v>

326
00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:03.360
<v Speaker 2>the best mitigating factors for dealing with a neurotic thoughts.</v>

327
00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:04.800
<v Speaker 2>Like if I have an issue,</v>

328
00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:05.873
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

329
00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:11.120
<v Speaker 2>one of the big issues if I've ever had anything go wrong was that I didn't work</v>

330
00:10:11.221 --> 00:10:12.030
<v Speaker 2>hard enough.</v>

331
00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:15.780
<v Speaker 2>So if I know for a fact that I worked as hard as I could,</v>

332
00:10:15.781 --> 00:10:17.010
<v Speaker 2>like back when I was competing,</v>

333
00:10:17.011 --> 00:10:18.030
<v Speaker 2>that was a huge issue.</v>

334
00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:19.441
<v Speaker 2>And it also,</v>

335
00:10:19.441 --> 00:10:19.610
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

336
00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:20.730
<v Speaker 2>mitigated nervousness.</v>

337
00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:22.020
<v Speaker 2>Cause Look,</v>

338
00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:26.400
<v Speaker 2>whenever you're involved in a competition as terrifying as a full contact</v>

339
00:10:26.401 --> 00:10:30.810
<v Speaker 2>martial arts tournament where concussions are not just likely,</v>

340
00:10:30.811 --> 00:10:33.090
<v Speaker 2>but it's someone in,</v>

341
00:10:33.091 --> 00:10:34.650
<v Speaker 2>there's a hundred people fighting in this tournament,</v>

342
00:10:34.651 --> 00:10:35.730
<v Speaker 2>someone's going to sleep,</v>

343
00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:38.190
<v Speaker 2>someone's going to get knocked out because it going to be you and someone's</v>

344
00:10:38.191 --> 00:10:39.120
<v Speaker 2>going to get their nose broken.</v>

345
00:10:39.121 --> 00:10:39.954
<v Speaker 2>Someone's going to get hit.</v>

346
00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:42.240
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people are probably,</v>

347
00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:43.823
<v Speaker 2>if I,</v>

348
00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:45.950
<v Speaker 2>if I trained really hard,</v>

349
00:10:45.951 --> 00:10:47.730
<v Speaker 2>if like I know I did everything that I could,</v>

350
00:10:47.731 --> 00:10:48.600
<v Speaker 2>I ate right,</v>

351
00:10:48.601 --> 00:10:49.620
<v Speaker 2>I slept right.</v>

352
00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.180
<v Speaker 2>I put in all the practice,</v>

353
00:10:51.181 --> 00:10:52.680
<v Speaker 2>I worked on all my weaknesses.</v>

354
00:10:52.681 --> 00:10:52.841
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

355
00:10:52.841 --> 00:10:53.041
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

356
00:10:53.041 --> 00:10:53.521
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

357
00:10:53.521 --> 00:10:55.590
<v Speaker 2>I didn't neglect my strengths.</v>

358
00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:57.030
<v Speaker 2>I was much less nervous,</v>

359
00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:00.990
<v Speaker 2>much less nervous and much better at dealing with losses.</v>

360
00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:02.430
<v Speaker 2>Whereas losses,</v>

361
00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:02.850
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

362
00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:07.560
<v Speaker 2>I think losses for martial artists can be insanely devastating.</v>

363
00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:08.370
<v Speaker 2>Like A,</v>

364
00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:10.830
<v Speaker 2>I was listening to this interview with Travis Brown,</v>

365
00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:11.101
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

366
00:11:11.101 --> 00:11:12.690
<v Speaker 2>he has no UFC heavyweight,</v>

367
00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:13.380
<v Speaker 2>one of the top,</v>

368
00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:14.670
<v Speaker 2>top five guys in the world,</v>

369
00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:17.850
<v Speaker 2>great fighter lost recently to Fabricio for doom.</v>

370
00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:18.470
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

371
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:19.860
<v Speaker 2>Any title elimination fight.</v>

372
00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:23.370
<v Speaker 2>So Fabrisio has gone on and he'll be fighting Cain Velasquez for the heavyweight</v>

373
00:11:23.371 --> 00:11:23.671
<v Speaker 2>title.</v>

374
00:11:23.671 --> 00:11:28.671
<v Speaker 2>Now in October in Mexico and a huge October or November,</v>

375
00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:29.250
<v Speaker 2>November,</v>

376
00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:30.060
<v Speaker 2>believe it's November.</v>

377
00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:30.930
<v Speaker 2>What are one of those?</v>

378
00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:31.620
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

379
00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:34.350
<v Speaker 2>he's fighting a Cain Velasquez for the title.</v>

380
00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:35.130
<v Speaker 2>Huge fight.</v>

381
00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:36.150
<v Speaker 2>It could've been Travis Browne,</v>

382
00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:39.510
<v Speaker 2>Travis Browne lost the fight by decision and you know,</v>

383
00:11:39.511 --> 00:11:39.721
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

384
00:11:39.721 --> 00:11:40.010
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

385
00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:40.351
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

386
00:11:40.351 --> 00:11:41.760
<v Speaker 2>he lost without a doubt.</v>

387
00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:43.080
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

388
00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:44.310
<v Speaker 2>wasn't embarrassing.</v>

389
00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:45.361
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't a,</v>

390
00:11:45.361 --> 00:11:46.890
<v Speaker 2>he didn't get knocked out in the first round.</v>

391
00:11:46.891 --> 00:11:48.300
<v Speaker 2>He didn't get submitted really quickly,</v>

392
00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:52.170
<v Speaker 2>but he did lose the fight and it was apparently devastating to him.</v>

393
00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:52.621
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

394
00:11:52.621 --> 00:11:54.130
<v Speaker 2>he's in great depth</v>

395
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:57.190
<v Speaker 1>about lying in bed in the fetal position crying.</v>

396
00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:02.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean his fucking 250 pound gladiator and he's curled up in a fetal position</v>

397
00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:03.783
<v Speaker 1>crying.</v>

398
00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:04.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

399
00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:05.150
<v Speaker 1>the truth is I have to,</v>

400
00:12:05.151 --> 00:12:07.540
<v Speaker 1>the ego is always curled up in the fetal position crying.</v>

401
00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:09.730
<v Speaker 1>We all have that</v>

402
00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.180
<v Speaker 1>part of ourselves and it's,</v>

403
00:12:13.181 --> 00:12:13.990
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

404
00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:14.201
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

405
00:12:14.201 --> 00:12:14.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean that,</v>

406
00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:19.150
<v Speaker 1>and that's what is so excruciating about the self and the self really is the</v>

407
00:12:19.151 --> 00:12:21.430
<v Speaker 1>center of the center of our problem.</v>

408
00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:21.701
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

409
00:12:21.701 --> 00:12:21.931
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

410
00:12:21.931 --> 00:12:24.880
<v Speaker 1>and when things are really going well,</v>

411
00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:29.140
<v Speaker 1>we are consoled by how well they're going.</v>

412
00:12:29.141 --> 00:12:30.040
<v Speaker 1>But we know it's,</v>

413
00:12:30.041 --> 00:12:31.240
<v Speaker 1>it's vulnerable to change.</v>

414
00:12:31.241 --> 00:12:31.361
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

415
00:12:31.361 --> 00:12:33.940
<v Speaker 1>you're only as good as your last appearance in some sense.</v>

416
00:12:33.941 --> 00:12:34.091
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

417
00:12:34.091 --> 00:12:38.350
<v Speaker 1>I could do something incredibly embarrassing in the middle of this podcast and</v>

418
00:12:38.351 --> 00:12:41.110
<v Speaker 1>that will be the thing I'm thinking about tonight.</v>

419
00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:41.921
<v Speaker 1>And I'll be,</v>

420
00:12:41.921 --> 00:12:42.401
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking,</v>

421
00:12:42.401 --> 00:12:42.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

422
00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:42.911
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

423
00:12:42.911 --> 00:12:45.470
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe I fucked that up so bad and Joe's podcast.</v>

424
00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:46.653
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

425
00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:48.730
<v Speaker 1>and that it's,</v>

426
00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:51.010
<v Speaker 1>you're always vulnerable to that for the recipe for it.</v>

427
00:12:51.011 --> 00:12:51.844
<v Speaker 1>As long as you,</v>

428
00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:54.130
<v Speaker 1>as long as you're in the center of this thing,</v>

429
00:12:54.131 --> 00:12:57.310
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable to what other other people think about you and,</v>

430
00:12:57.780 --> 00:12:58.613
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

431
00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:03.910
<v Speaker 1>a captive of your really crazy rehearsal of experience.</v>

432
00:13:03.911 --> 00:13:04.181
<v Speaker 1>And when you,</v>

433
00:13:04.181 --> 00:13:05.410
<v Speaker 1>when something like this happens to you,</v>

434
00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:09.520
<v Speaker 1>just think of how many times you repeat it to yourself.</v>

435
00:13:09.521 --> 00:13:14.521
<v Speaker 1>It's like you tell yourself the same story 15 times a minute for hours and it</v>

436
00:13:16.841 --> 00:13:18.790
<v Speaker 1>doesn't strike you as insane,</v>

437
00:13:18.791 --> 00:13:20.170
<v Speaker 1>but it actually is insane.</v>

438
00:13:20.171 --> 00:13:20.321
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

439
00:13:20.321 --> 00:13:20.420
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

440
00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:21.253
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

441
00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:26.080
<v Speaker 1>if you are thoughts could be broadcast on a monitor for other people to hear and</v>

442
00:13:26.081 --> 00:13:30.130
<v Speaker 1>they could hear you repeat yourself over and over and over again.</v>

443
00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:32.440
<v Speaker 1>It would seem starkly crazy.</v>

444
00:13:32.441 --> 00:13:34.390
<v Speaker 1>It just it and yet it seems normal.</v>

445
00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:34.610
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

446
00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:35.290
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of like,</v>

447
00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:40.050
<v Speaker 1>like the dream state where you go to sleep and you're in your bed and you,</v>

448
00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:40.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

449
00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:41.410
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

450
00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:42.940
<v Speaker 1>everything's obeying the laws of physics.</v>

451
00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:46.930
<v Speaker 1>And then in the next conscious moment you are,</v>

452
00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:47.561
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

453
00:13:47.561 --> 00:13:48.880
<v Speaker 1>at a party somewhere,</v>

454
00:13:48.881 --> 00:13:50.440
<v Speaker 1>it's talking to someone who you know,</v>

455
00:13:50.441 --> 00:13:51.340
<v Speaker 1>is dead and saying,</v>

456
00:13:51.341 --> 00:13:51.431
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

457
00:13:51.431 --> 00:13:52.160
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe you're,</v>

458
00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:53.050
<v Speaker 1>you're alive now.</v>

459
00:13:53.051 --> 00:13:53.171
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

460
00:13:53.171 --> 00:13:53.780
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

461
00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:54.640
<v Speaker 1>and then you know,</v>

462
00:13:54.641 --> 00:13:56.050
<v Speaker 1>there's a gorilla in the room and,</v>

463
00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:56.800
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

464
00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.980
<v Speaker 1>and none of this strikes you as crazy.</v>

465
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000
<v Speaker 1>It's the craziest things about dreams is that the mind seems to just accept them</v>

466
00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:09.970
<v Speaker 1>except these changes one after the other without any sense.</v>

467
00:14:09.971 --> 00:14:12.690
<v Speaker 1>That there should be continuity and this is due.</v>

468
00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:16.990
<v Speaker 1>There's no question that this is due to the diminished activity of the frontal</v>

469
00:14:16.991 --> 00:14:18.850
<v Speaker 1>lobes dirt during rem sleep and that we just,</v>

470
00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:23.830
<v Speaker 1>our truth or reality testing hardware has come largely offline during dreams.</v>

471
00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:29.260
<v Speaker 1>But there's something analogous happening when we're just thinking in the waking</v>

472
00:14:29.261 --> 00:14:31.030
<v Speaker 1>state because thoughts are,</v>

473
00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:33.420
<v Speaker 1>thoughts don't make much sense because the,</v>

474
00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:36.940
<v Speaker 1>the repetition is we don't notice how crazy the repetition is.</v>

475
00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:39.640
<v Speaker 1>And we would notice it if we were talking to each other.</v>

476
00:14:39.641 --> 00:14:43.500
<v Speaker 1>If I was telling you the same thing 15 times in a row without a,</v>

477
00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:47.170
<v Speaker 1>without honoring your expectation that I might move on to another topic,</v>

478
00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:47.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

479
00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:48.190
<v Speaker 1>you would,</v>

480
00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:49.600
<v Speaker 1>you would notice and I would notice.</v>

481
00:14:49.601 --> 00:14:50.230
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

482
00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:51.063
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

483
00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:53.450
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

484
00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:54.951
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

485
00:14:54.951 --> 00:14:55.031
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

486
00:14:55.031 --> 00:14:59.200
<v Speaker 1>and the other thing that's crazy about thoughts is that much of our thinking and</v>

487
00:14:59.201 --> 00:15:00.560
<v Speaker 1>certainly our linguistic thoughts,</v>

488
00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:06.500
<v Speaker 1>or it's structured as though it were a conversation and we played both sides of</v>

489
00:15:06.501 --> 00:15:07.250
<v Speaker 1>the conversation.</v>

490
00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:07.971
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

491
00:15:07.971 --> 00:15:08.181
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

492
00:15:08.181 --> 00:15:08.450
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

493
00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:10.910
<v Speaker 1>I'll sit down here and,</v>

494
00:15:10.911 --> 00:15:11.330
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

495
00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:11.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

496
00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:12.350
<v Speaker 1>I said I came in,</v>

497
00:15:12.351 --> 00:15:13.520
<v Speaker 1>I sat down and,</v>

498
00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:14.433
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

499
00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:18.290
<v Speaker 1>I brought you a book and I wanted to sign the book and I see this pen over here</v>

500
00:15:18.291 --> 00:15:18.391
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

501
00:15:18.391 --> 00:15:19.760
<v Speaker 1>and I think,</v>

502
00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:20.211
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

503
00:15:20.211 --> 00:15:20.361
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

504
00:15:20.361 --> 00:15:22.160
<v Speaker 1>There's a pen over there right now.</v>

505
00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:24.530
<v Speaker 1>I can see that there's a pen over there.</v>

506
00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:25.460
<v Speaker 1>So who am I?</v>

507
00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:27.770
<v Speaker 1>Why do I have to say there's a pen over there,</v>

508
00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:27.990
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

509
00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:28.640
<v Speaker 1>Who am I telling?</v>

510
00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:31.100
<v Speaker 1>Is there someone in me who can't see that there's a pen over there?</v>

511
00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:31.761
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

512
00:15:31.761 --> 00:15:33.250
<v Speaker 1>So there's a conversation that started like,</v>

513
00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:34.490
<v Speaker 1>and I'm both sides of it,</v>

514
00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:36.290
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't make any sense.</v>

515
00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:36.531
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

516
00:15:36.531 --> 00:15:36.611
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

517
00:15:36.611 --> 00:15:37.780
<v Speaker 1>and yet we are,</v>

518
00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:40.310
<v Speaker 1>our subjectivity is continually,</v>

519
00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:41.663
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

520
00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:42.810
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

521
00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:43.643
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>

522
00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:48.620
<v Speaker 1>it is discursive in that way and they're just voices talking to each other.</v>

523
00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:50.650
<v Speaker 1>And there's not only,</v>

524
00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:53.120
<v Speaker 1>not only are there not to have us in there,</v>

525
00:15:53.121 --> 00:15:54.440
<v Speaker 1>there's not even one of us in there.</v>

526
00:15:54.441 --> 00:15:54.741
<v Speaker 1>There's not,</v>

527
00:15:54.741 --> 00:15:55.940
<v Speaker 1>the thinker isn't there,</v>

528
00:15:55.941 --> 00:15:57.560
<v Speaker 1>but we seem to have two of them.</v>

529
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:59.600
<v Speaker 1>It's like we're constantly talking to mommy and Daddy.</v>

530
00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:00.441
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

531
00:16:00.441 --> 00:16:02.570
<v Speaker 1>and in fact,</v>

532
00:16:02.571 --> 00:16:06.020
<v Speaker 1>I could be the way this conversation gets internalized,</v>

533
00:16:06.021 --> 00:16:06.351
<v Speaker 1>cause you know,</v>

534
00:16:06.351 --> 00:16:09.590
<v Speaker 1>I can see it in my kids now where they seem to all the Aleve,</v>

535
00:16:09.591 --> 00:16:10.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

536
00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:14.330
<v Speaker 1>I'll listen to my daughter or playing by herself and she's talking to herself</v>

537
00:16:14.331 --> 00:16:15.710
<v Speaker 1>out loud in the way that,</v>

538
00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:16.251
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

539
00:16:16.251 --> 00:16:16.521
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

540
00:16:16.521 --> 00:16:18.440
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to be sort of crazy to do as an adult.</v>

541
00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:18.981
<v Speaker 1>But as a kid,</v>

542
00:16:18.981 --> 00:16:19.341
<v Speaker 1>you're just,</v>

543
00:16:19.341 --> 00:16:19.611
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

544
00:16:19.611 --> 00:16:20.690
<v Speaker 1>you're just talking out loud.</v>

545
00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:21.530
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

546
00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:25.340
<v Speaker 1>and eventually we all learned to internalize that conversation.</v>

547
00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:26.540
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

548
00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:27.373
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

549
00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:28.071
<v Speaker 1>and when you don't,</v>

550
00:16:28.071 --> 00:16:29.510
<v Speaker 1>when people who can't internalize it will,</v>

551
00:16:29.511 --> 00:16:30.290
<v Speaker 1>they're the crazy ones.</v>

552
00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:30.441
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

553
00:16:30.441 --> 00:16:30.651
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

554
00:16:30.651 --> 00:16:33.750
<v Speaker 1>the person who's walking down the street just saying,</v>

555
00:16:33.751 --> 00:16:34.041
<v Speaker 1>oh good,</v>

556
00:16:34.041 --> 00:16:35.710
<v Speaker 1>there's a pen over there and what w God,</v>

557
00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:36.351
<v Speaker 1>we're late.</v>

558
00:16:36.351 --> 00:16:36.651
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

559
00:16:36.651 --> 00:16:37.484
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

560
00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:37.881
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

561
00:16:37.881 --> 00:16:39.800
<v Speaker 1>I know Joe Joe is gonna really be pissed.</v>

562
00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:40.610
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

563
00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:42.800
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe I sh I should have checked the traffic before I left.</v>

564
00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:46.460
<v Speaker 1>So these are the kinds of thoughts I could think silently in,</v>

565
00:16:46.461 --> 00:16:46.681
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

566
00:16:46.681 --> 00:16:48.170
<v Speaker 1>in the space of my mind.</v>

567
00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:48.890
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

568
00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:49.700
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

569
00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:51.110
<v Speaker 1>and it wouldn't be starkly crazy,</v>

570
00:16:51.111 --> 00:16:53.120
<v Speaker 1>but to verbalize them then you're a madman.</v>

571
00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:53.870
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>

572
00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:58.400
<v Speaker 1>that difference between letting them out and just knowing to keep your mouth</v>

573
00:16:58.401 --> 00:17:00.790
<v Speaker 1>shut is it captures a,</v>

574
00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:03.440
<v Speaker 1>a large part of the difference between being,</v>

575
00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:04.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

576
00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:04.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

577
00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:06.530
<v Speaker 1>a proper lunatic,</v>

578
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:07.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

579
00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:08.480
<v Speaker 1>and in normal person.</v>

580
00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:12.740
<v Speaker 1>But what I argue in this book is that it's normal isn't good enough.</v>

581
00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:13.221
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

582
00:17:13.221 --> 00:17:13.910
<v Speaker 1>the normal,</v>

583
00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:18.910
<v Speaker 1>the normal state of consciousness wherein you are just chased out of bed every</v>

584
00:17:20.211 --> 00:17:21.920
<v Speaker 1>morning by your thoughts and you think,</v>

585
00:17:21.921 --> 00:17:22.131
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

586
00:17:22.131 --> 00:17:22.311
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

587
00:17:22.311 --> 00:17:22.491
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

588
00:17:22.491 --> 00:17:26.090
<v Speaker 1>think every waking moment until you fall helplessly asleep at night.</v>

589
00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:27.493
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

590
00:17:27.830 --> 00:17:30.320
<v Speaker 1>that's not necessarily a happy place to be.</v>

591
00:17:30.321 --> 00:17:31.910
<v Speaker 1>And it's not the only alternative.</v>

592
00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:32.280
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

593
00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:33.113
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

594
00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:34.363
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

595
00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:35.060
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

596
00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:36.380
<v Speaker 1>and thought it's not that you're,</v>

597
00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:39.020
<v Speaker 1>the goal is not to have a mind without thoughts,</v>

598
00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:40.580
<v Speaker 1>but we need thoughts and you can't,</v>

599
00:17:40.581 --> 00:17:40.701
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

600
00:17:40.701 --> 00:17:45.701
<v Speaker 1>everything we do as human beings for the most part d requires thought to get off</v>

601
00:17:47.241 --> 00:17:47.721
<v Speaker 1>the ground.</v>

602
00:17:47.721 --> 00:17:52.380
<v Speaker 1>So our relationships are based on thoughts and our every public institution and</v>

603
00:17:52.381 --> 00:17:52.960
<v Speaker 1>science.</v>

604
00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:53.670
<v Speaker 1>It's all,</v>

605
00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:58.670
<v Speaker 1>it's this conversation we have with ourselves and with others is based on,</v>

606
00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:01.500
<v Speaker 1>on language,</v>

607
00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:02.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

608
00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:05.850
<v Speaker 1>almost an a and a and concepts that are mediated by language.</v>

609
00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:06.683
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

610
00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:07.553
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

611
00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:09.240
<v Speaker 1>so you need thought.</v>

612
00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:14.270
<v Speaker 1>But the difference is the difference is between thinking and knowing that you're</v>

613
00:18:16.591 --> 00:18:20.940
<v Speaker 1>thinking in really knowing that you're thinking in the moment of thoughts</v>

614
00:18:20.941 --> 00:18:22.980
<v Speaker 1>arising or being lost in thought.</v>

615
00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:24.360
<v Speaker 1>And then when you're lost in thought,</v>

616
00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:28.290
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't really matter what the content is.</v>

617
00:18:28.291 --> 00:18:31.530
<v Speaker 1>You're still confused about who and what you are.</v>

618
00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:31.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

619
00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:34.680
<v Speaker 1>you gotta be thinking about then what you can be thinking about the most</v>

620
00:18:34.681 --> 00:18:36.720
<v Speaker 1>profound things in science or in,</v>

621
00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:39.030
<v Speaker 1>in ethics or whatever it is.</v>

622
00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:42.780
<v Speaker 1>But if you're just thinking without knowing that you're thinking there is a kind</v>

623
00:18:42.781 --> 00:18:43.501
<v Speaker 1>of delusion there,</v>

624
00:18:43.501 --> 00:18:46.590
<v Speaker 1>it is analogous to the dream state in a way where you're just,</v>

625
00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:47.760
<v Speaker 1>you're not,</v>

626
00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:51.000
<v Speaker 1>it's not clear to you what's going on youth,</v>

627
00:18:51.001 --> 00:18:53.400
<v Speaker 1>the youth that you think you are the thinker of the thoughts,</v>

628
00:18:53.401 --> 00:18:55.950
<v Speaker 1>you think you're offering your thoughts in a way that's you're,</v>

629
00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:57.001
<v Speaker 1>you're not,</v>

630
00:18:57.001 --> 00:18:57.151
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

631
00:18:57.151 --> 00:18:58.590
<v Speaker 1>cause thoughts just arrives.</v>

632
00:18:58.620 --> 00:18:59.011
<v Speaker 1>We don't,</v>

633
00:18:59.011 --> 00:19:00.120
<v Speaker 1>we don't actually offer them</v>

634
00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:07.440
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible]</v>

635
00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:10.110
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
