00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.880
<v Speaker 1>The Joe Rogan experience mean he could</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you wanted to,</v>

2
00:00:02.881 --> 00:00:06.160
<v Speaker 1>but he thinks that it complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel bad for the Dalai Lama because</v>

3
00:00:06.161 --> 00:00:07.890
<v Speaker 1>Richard Gere always wants to hang out</v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

4
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.990
<v Speaker 1>You can see the Dalai Lama like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>pulling Richard Gere aside one day</v>

5
00:00:13.991 --> 00:00:15.490
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey Richard,</v>

6
00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:21.060
<v Speaker 1>have you ever considered scientology?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You imagine the conversations that Dalai</v>

7
00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.680
<v Speaker 1>Lama must have with like Sharon stone</v>
<v Speaker 1>where he's like,</v>

8
00:00:23.681 --> 00:00:24.600
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

9
00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.690
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe they chose her either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

10
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.010
<v Speaker 1>you look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

11
00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:33.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't watch a lot of movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you are amazing zing in basic</v>

12
00:00:33.451 --> 00:00:35.610
<v Speaker 1>instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought you were amazed and they</v>

13
00:00:35.611 --> 00:00:37.260
<v Speaker 1>didn't think you could pull it off in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the second one.</v>

14
00:00:37.261 --> 00:00:40.560
<v Speaker 1>You pulled it off in the second one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you see this basic instinct too?</v>

15
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.990
<v Speaker 1>It's a horror movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It changed.</v>

16
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.690
<v Speaker 1>It changed from an erotic film when</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sharon stone was young too,</v>

17
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.080
<v Speaker 1>like like a panic moment.</v>

18
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.620
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did sign.</v>

19
00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm a diligent worker when it comes to</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching stupid shit that I might be</v>

20
00:00:54.931 --> 00:00:56.400
<v Speaker 1>able to make fun of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's in it right?</v>

21
00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.140
<v Speaker 1>But she was like 50 and I'm not joking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She show anything like that.</v>

22
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.560
<v Speaker 1>But the whole leg thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a feeling that you get when</v>

23
00:01:04.561 --> 00:01:08.370
<v Speaker 1>a 50 year old woman who's trying really</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard to be sexy.</v>

24
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.560
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't know if she was directed in</v>
<v Speaker 1>that way.</v>

25
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.940
<v Speaker 1>But when you're 50 you realize by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time you're 50 you realized it's mostly</v>

26
00:01:14.941 --> 00:01:15.930
<v Speaker 1>all bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

27
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.370
<v Speaker 1>what are we doing here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

28
00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:18.660
<v Speaker 1>if we're gonna fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to talk.</v>

29
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.530
<v Speaker 1>But all this like sultry shift that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>might get away with when you're 20,</v>

30
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:23.810
<v Speaker 1>it's because you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

31
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.410
<v Speaker 1>you're a a spell when you're 20.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When a woman is in her young twenties,</v>

32
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.260
<v Speaker 1>she.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason why they have this idea of</v>

33
00:01:31.261 --> 00:01:33.240
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so inflated like really beautiful</v>

34
00:01:33.241 --> 00:01:36.690
<v Speaker 1>girls is because they're like magic.</v>

35
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.470
<v Speaker 1>Like you were around him in your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like your mood changes,</v>

36
00:01:40.471 --> 00:01:44.630
<v Speaker 1>you draw towards them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you soften your personality to or,</v>

37
00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.460
<v Speaker 1>or pick it up or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to get me to like you a little</v>

38
00:01:47.461 --> 00:01:49.800
<v Speaker 1>bit more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a drug.</v>

39
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.510
<v Speaker 1>It's like a fascinating erotic draw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then when they get 50 and they're</v>

40
00:01:54.511 --> 00:01:56.670
<v Speaker 1>still doing the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's like,</v>

41
00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.740
<v Speaker 1>oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's wrong with her?</v>

42
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.500
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you see her cross her legs,</v>

43
00:02:01.501 --> 00:02:06.090
<v Speaker 1>just like a real moment of panic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where I would think about me in my</v>

44
00:02:06.091 --> 00:02:07.860
<v Speaker 1>younger days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I was in that scenario,</v>

45
00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:08.760
<v Speaker 1>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

46
00:02:08.761 --> 00:02:11.190
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gotta get the Fuck Outta here.</v>

47
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.120
<v Speaker 1>It was that moment with a 50 year old</v>
<v Speaker 1>lady shows you her gapper and then</v>

48
00:02:15.121 --> 00:02:16.980
<v Speaker 1>closes the legs over and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nope.</v>

49
00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.360
<v Speaker 1>I gotta go right now I am going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is not the way.</v>

50
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.360
<v Speaker 1>Like a healthy sexually confident 50</v>
<v Speaker 1>year old woman would would fuck you.</v>

51
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.890
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe they just had her do it</v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

52
00:02:28.891 --> 00:02:31.860
<v Speaker 1>That's the lane or two lanes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the unknown.</v>

53
00:02:31.861 --> 00:02:34.000
<v Speaker 1>Necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was so unnecessary,</v>

54
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.100
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

55
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.460
<v Speaker 1>what's the Hollywood unnecessary ideas?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

56
00:02:39.461 --> 00:02:42.880
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like someone who's never</v>
<v Speaker 1>done standing up trying to craft a joke</v>

57
00:02:42.881 --> 00:02:44.260
<v Speaker 1>on this is going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

58
00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.120
<v Speaker 1>you don't really have a chance to vet</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

59
00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.020
<v Speaker 1>You just have to put it out there as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie and hope that people get it in the</v>

60
00:02:50.021 --> 00:02:53.350
<v Speaker 1>first basic jeans to instinct was really</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking,</v>

61
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was well received.</v>

62
00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.710
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't the best movie in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was kind of fun.</v>

63
00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.570
<v Speaker 1>I</v>
<v Speaker 1>took your your interest and she's sexy</v>
