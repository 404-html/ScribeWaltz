<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I decided I try to work on this calmness</v>

2
00:00:04.621 --> 00:00:06.270

<v Speaker 1>And for me,</v>

3
00:00:06.271 --> 00:00:09.120
<v Speaker 1>driving and road rage was the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to have the worst road rage ever.</v>

4
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.670
<v Speaker 1>Oh Dude,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you would not recognize me.</v>

6
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.990
<v Speaker 1>I once got taken to the police station</v>
<v Speaker 1>because someone accused me is this,</v>

7
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.850
<v Speaker 1>this is a while back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they accused me of a,</v>

8
00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.350
<v Speaker 1>exposing myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll driving.</v>

9
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.230
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what the truth of the matters that</v>

00:00:25.231 --> 00:00:27.060
<v Speaker 1>someone cut me off and I got pissed off</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I said,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Hong Kong.</v>

18
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.220
<v Speaker 1>And he said to people while they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>driving,</v>

19
00:00:44.221 --> 00:00:44.550
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

20
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.300
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I made the,</v>

21
00:00:46.301 --> 00:00:47.131
<v Speaker 1>I made the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

22
00:00:47.131 --> 00:00:49.650
<v Speaker 1>the graphical motion to have them blow</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

23
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:50.401
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

24
00:00:50.401 --> 00:00:51.091
<v Speaker 1>Like basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

25
00:00:51.091 --> 00:00:53.250
<v Speaker 1>blow me a few.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

26
00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.390
<v Speaker 1>so what did the same exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

27
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.420
<v Speaker 1>I was kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd forgot about it and this police</v>

28
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.450
<v Speaker 1>officer leaves her business card on my</v>
<v Speaker 1>front porch and apparently whoever cut</v>

29
00:01:05.761 --> 00:01:09.780
<v Speaker 1>me off was just a complete idiot of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>driver and like really apparently</v>

30
00:01:09.781 --> 00:01:11.520
<v Speaker 1>thought I did this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this,</v>

31
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.800
<v Speaker 1>this little police officer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>woman is like,</v>

32
00:01:13.801 --> 00:01:14.710
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

33
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.680
<v Speaker 1>I know you at the beginning of a porno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I swear to God in the police station.</v>

34
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:20.730
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

35
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.890
<v Speaker 1>I know you did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I started laughing.</v>

36
00:01:22.891 --> 00:01:24.450
<v Speaker 1>I look for cameras.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I thought it was a joke.</v>

37
00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:26.790
<v Speaker 1>Like I thought some friends of mine had</v>
<v Speaker 1>really seriously hooked me up on this</v>

38
00:01:26.791 --> 00:01:29.040
<v Speaker 1>because there's no way it was so far</v>
<v Speaker 1>from my reality.</v>

39
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.270
<v Speaker 1>And she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

40
00:01:30.271 --> 00:01:32.040
<v Speaker 1>I know you did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have witnesses and I'm like,</v>

41
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.380
<v Speaker 1>you can't have witnesses because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't happen like you're lying.</v>

42
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.080
<v Speaker 1>And we went back and forth for two hours</v>
<v Speaker 1>about this.</v>

43
00:01:37.081 --> 00:01:39.930
<v Speaker 1>This is how bad my road dredge was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two hours she was full on,</v>

44
00:01:39.931 --> 00:01:40.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go to the DA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

45
00:01:40.861 --> 00:01:42.540
<v Speaker 1>you can't go to the aid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no evidence.</v>

46
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.550
<v Speaker 1>And furthermore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anatomically,</v>

47
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.080
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is my lap,</v>

48
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.660
<v Speaker 1>this is the side of the car and this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the steering wheel is.</v>

49
00:01:48.661 --> 00:01:52.380
<v Speaker 1>So unless I'm like hung like a horse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is not possible to drive and expose</v>

50
00:01:52.381 --> 00:01:54.160
<v Speaker 1>yourself at the same time to some in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>car next to you.</v>

51
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't do that.</v>

52
00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.070
<v Speaker 1>So finally I did this lie detector test</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I passed out.</v>

53
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.140
<v Speaker 1>I volunteered to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

54
00:02:01.141 --> 00:02:02.580
<v Speaker 1>I got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing going on here.</v>

55
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.520
<v Speaker 1>It was so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stopple I can't even tell you,</v>

56
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.740
<v Speaker 1>but that's how bad my road rage was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like no wait.</v>

57
00:02:07.741 --> 00:02:10.960
<v Speaker 1>He had to go to the station to get it</v>
<v Speaker 1>light or did they have a lie detector?</v>

58
00:02:10.961 --> 00:02:12.990
<v Speaker 1>You're testing the car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's got one.</v>

59
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.300
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is bad.</v>

60
00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.610
<v Speaker 1>This is a month after it happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>

61
00:02:17.611 --> 00:02:19.200
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was scary actually.</v>

62
00:02:19.201 --> 00:02:21.360
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I realized I was absolutely guilty.</v>

63
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.490
<v Speaker 1>So many girls that have turned down the</v>
<v Speaker 1>$25,000 offer from some king that just</v>

64
00:02:26.491 --> 00:02:29.780
<v Speaker 1>like just goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It hits all the ladies like 25,000 week</v>

65
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.550
<v Speaker 1>in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I know so many people that have</v>

66
00:02:32.551 --> 00:02:34.710
<v Speaker 1>turned it down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I also know a couple girls that have</v>

67
00:02:34.711 --> 00:02:38.730
<v Speaker 1>done it and that's his fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's quite a few of those</v>

68
00:02:38.731 --> 00:02:39.471
<v Speaker 1>guys out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

69
00:02:39.471 --> 00:02:42.990
<v Speaker 1>I've been to Dubai a number of times and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's $50 ones.</v>

70
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.870
<v Speaker 1>They're $50 for a prostitute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

71
00:02:45.871 --> 00:02:49.260
<v Speaker 1>but what I'm saying is that these guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>that get girls from America and have</v>

72
00:02:49.261 --> 00:02:50.160
<v Speaker 1>them shipped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah.</v>

73
00:02:50.161 --> 00:02:51.360
<v Speaker 1>That to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy shit.</v>

74
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.260
<v Speaker 1>That kind of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a way,</v>

75
00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.280
<v Speaker 1>this is a weird reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know when you have like trillions of</v>

76
00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.720
<v Speaker 1>dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's people who are like,</v>

77
00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.530
<v Speaker 1>I think as far as private wealth is</v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned,</v>

78
00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.230
<v Speaker 1>like what we know and you see like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>richest man in the world,</v>

79
00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.760
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not really.</v>

80
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.620
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because what you're getting is the</v>

81
00:03:06.621 --> 00:03:09.560
<v Speaker 1>richest man in the world who has assets</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are measurable,</v>

82
00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.620
<v Speaker 1>like in the stock market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're dealing with canes,</v>

83
00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.800
<v Speaker 1>you don't have any fucking idea how much</v>
<v Speaker 1>those guys have.</v>

84
00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.390
<v Speaker 1>You don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why should you know?</v>

85
00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.220
<v Speaker 1>I got a buddy who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a bank.</v>

86
00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.060
<v Speaker 1>I got a buddy who's a billionaire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real live billionaire and uh,</v>

87
00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:24.800
<v Speaker 1>never knew he had money for years.</v>

88
00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:25.640
<v Speaker 1>He was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

89
00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.950
<v Speaker 1>my friend's friend and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never knew.</v>

90
00:03:27.951 --> 00:03:30.950
<v Speaker 1>We hung out in New York and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then one day I was reading about his</v>

91
00:03:30.951 --> 00:03:34.490
<v Speaker 1>family in the newspaper and I went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Fuck.</v>

92
00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:35.960
<v Speaker 1>And I called him on the phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

93
00:03:35.961 --> 00:03:37.040
<v Speaker 1>you have money?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>this is bullshit.</v>

99
00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.240
<v Speaker 1>We have never gotten to take advantage</v>
<v Speaker 1>of this.</v>

100
00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.690
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have like crazy fuck you money.</v>

101
00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:55.910
<v Speaker 1>So years later he came into the money</v>
<v Speaker 1>like where it was his,</v>

102
00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.230
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so creepy.</v>

103
00:03:57.231 --> 00:03:59.840
<v Speaker 1>Just sitting around lazy waiting for it</v>
<v Speaker 1>to happen.</v>

104
00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.960
<v Speaker 1>We worked hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

105
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.280
<v Speaker 1>but someone did die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to give away who we</v>

106
00:04:04.281 --> 00:04:05.540
<v Speaker 1>possibly is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but okay.</v>

107
00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:10.250

<v Speaker 1>like in the year end,</v>

110
00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.860
<v Speaker 1>a year from when he like took over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>money to,</v>

<v Speaker 1>he would call me and be like,</v>

112
00:04:20.601 --> 00:04:21.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm in Vegas.</v>
