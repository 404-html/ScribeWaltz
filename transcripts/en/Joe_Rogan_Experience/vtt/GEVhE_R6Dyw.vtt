<v Speaker 1>I had like some history of boxing and my family and he brought me this great</v>

15
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.110
<v Speaker 1>picture of all the Philly fighters and I was at the,</v>

16
00:00:19.111 --> 00:00:21.870
<v Speaker 1>at the dinner with him one night and I started picking his brain a little.</v>

17
00:00:21.871 --> 00:00:22.141
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

18
00:00:22.141 --> 00:00:23.460
<v Speaker 1>who was the baddest motherfucker?</v>

19

21
00:00:28.741 --> 00:00:29.574
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

22
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:30.600
<v Speaker 1>Sonny Liston,</v>

23
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:31.680
<v Speaker 1>hands down.</v>

24
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:32.340
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

25
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.200
<v Speaker 1>He said everybody was afraid of him and he said,</v>

26
00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:34.351
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

27
00:00:34.351 --> 00:00:34.780
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

28
00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:35.081
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

29
00:00:35.081 --> 00:00:35.930
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of problems.</v>

30
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:37.021
<v Speaker 1>Whatever.</v>

31
00:00:37.021 --> 00:00:37.490
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

32
00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:38.100
<v Speaker 1>Mob ties.</v>

33
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.281
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

34
00:00:38.281 --> 00:00:40.560
<v Speaker 1>But apparently heroine and you know,</v>

35
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.200
<v Speaker 1>that second Ali fight was definitely thrown.</v>

36
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:44.100
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

37
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.401
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

38
00:00:44.401 --> 00:00:45.720
<v Speaker 1>or you could say it's such a joke.</v>

39
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.500
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

40
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.580
<v Speaker 1>he's faking.</v>

41
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:48.030
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

42
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.630
<v Speaker 1>he got punched like they call it a phantom punch is not a fan of punch.</v>

43
00:00:51.631 --> 00:00:52.500
<v Speaker 1>He definitely got punched,</v>

44
00:00:52.501 --> 00:00:56.820
<v Speaker 1>but he was waiting for the first punch to land so that he could just lay down.</v>

45
00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.110
<v Speaker 1>Like he pulled that up.</v>

46
00:00:58.111 --> 00:00:58.471
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy,</v>

47
00:00:58.471 --> 00:00:59.310
<v Speaker 1>we go watch this.</v>

48
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.430
<v Speaker 1>It's a Muhammad Ali versus Sonny Liston too,</v>

49
00:01:02.431 --> 00:01:03.211
<v Speaker 1>in Lewiston,</v>

50
00:01:03.211 --> 00:01:03.840
<v Speaker 1>Maine.</v>

51
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:04.170
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

52
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.280
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was going to be forming because of his size and his strength,</v>

53
00:01:08.281 --> 00:01:08.641
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>

54
00:01:08.641 --> 00:01:08.911
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

55
00:01:08.911 --> 00:01:09.391
<v Speaker 1>he's a list.</v>

56
00:01:09.391 --> 00:01:10.224
<v Speaker 1>It was the toughest.</v>

57
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:11.401
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

58
00:01:11.401 --> 00:01:11.671
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

59
00:01:11.671 --> 00:01:12.091
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

60
00:01:12.091 --> 00:01:15.570
<v Speaker 1>foreman before Ali beat him was a different animal post Ali.</v>

61
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.020
<v Speaker 1>He was never the same guy because that air of invincibility was gone.</v>

62
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.610
<v Speaker 1>And then he had that crazy fight.</v>

63
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.200
<v Speaker 1>I believe it was with Ron Lyle.</v>

64
00:01:22.201 --> 00:01:24.900
<v Speaker 1>They just fucking blasted each other in the head and knocked each other down</v>

65
00:01:24.901 --> 00:01:25.920
<v Speaker 1>like four or five times.</v>

66
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.610
<v Speaker 1>You remembered it punched that he hit a George Foreman with in Jamaica,</v>

67
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:30.301
<v Speaker 1>picked him up,</v>

68
00:01:30.301 --> 00:01:30.921
<v Speaker 1>not your chore.</v>

69
00:01:30.921 --> 00:01:34.350
<v Speaker 1>And Joe Frazier Frazier pick them up and the stomach punch.</v>

70
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember what,</v>

71
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:36.660
<v Speaker 1>what he hit him with,</v>

72
00:01:36.661 --> 00:01:37.494
<v Speaker 1>but I remember his,</v>

73
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.510
<v Speaker 1>his legs literally came up off the ground.</v>

74
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.830
<v Speaker 1>I never saw that before.</v>

75
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

76
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.210
<v Speaker 1>credible.</v>

77
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.050
<v Speaker 1>He was a monster.</v>

78
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.630
<v Speaker 1>He was such a fucking murderous puncher.</v>

79
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.390
<v Speaker 1>I was at the Spinx,</v>

80
00:01:47.391 --> 00:01:47.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

81
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.533
<v Speaker 1>Tyson foot.</v>

82
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.170
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

83
00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.003
<v Speaker 1>Michael Spinks.</v>

84
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.161
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

85
00:01:50.161 --> 00:01:52.040
<v Speaker 1>we talked about that a couple of times on podcasts.</v>

86
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.950
<v Speaker 1>I'll scary.</v>

87
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:53.401
<v Speaker 1>He's up.</v>

88
00:01:53.401 --> 00:01:54.180
<v Speaker 1>Jumped the devil.</v>

89
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

90
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:55.051
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

91
00:01:55.051 --> 00:01:56.090
<v Speaker 1>That's really what we,</v>

92
00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:57.990
<v Speaker 1>I think we talked about it at the laugh factory.</v>

93
00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.840
<v Speaker 1>I think we talked about it more than once because it was such a,</v>

94
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean you were there for like one of the most stunning moments in boxing</v>

95
00:02:04.381 --> 00:02:04.761
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>

96
00:02:04.761 --> 00:02:04.831
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

97
00:02:04.831 --> 00:02:05.340
<v Speaker 1>it was cool.</v>

98
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.070
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people taught Michael Spinks was going to give him a hard time cause</v>

99
00:02:08.071 --> 00:02:10.860
<v Speaker 1>spanx had gone 12 rounds at Larry Holmes and you know,</v>

100
00:02:10.861 --> 00:02:13.560
<v Speaker 1>and beat Larry Holmes by decision and you know,</v>

101
00:02:13.561 --> 00:02:15.330
<v Speaker 1>and he was the light heavyweight champion.</v>

102
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.650
<v Speaker 1>He was a good boxer.</v>

103
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.390
<v Speaker 1>He just had no business.</v>

104
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.070
<v Speaker 1>He was so small too.</v>

105
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.020
<v Speaker 1>He was barely one 99,</v>

106
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.411
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

107
00:02:22.411 --> 00:02:23.610
<v Speaker 1>and he's fighting Mike Tyson.</v>

108
00:02:23.611 --> 00:02:24.444
<v Speaker 1>Tyson was,</v>

109
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.620
<v Speaker 1>Tyson was a much bigger,</v>

110
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

111
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.480
<v Speaker 1>in comparison to today's fighters.</v>

112
00:02:27.481 --> 00:02:29.200
<v Speaker 1>He was probably like two 20 built better though.</v>

113
00:02:29.201 --> 00:02:34.201
<v Speaker 1>It's compact and 1965 Louis domain of watch this because Ali still looking slick</v>

114
00:02:37.531 --> 00:02:38.160
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

115
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.180
<v Speaker 1>There's still to this day,</v>

116
00:02:39.181 --> 00:02:40.620
<v Speaker 1>no heavyweight that moves like him.</v>

117
00:02:40.621 --> 00:02:41.370
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

118
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.140
<v Speaker 1>look how fucking good he moved.</v>

119
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.970
<v Speaker 1>So light on his feet for a guy who's 220 pounds or whatever the hell he was,</v>

120
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.020
<v Speaker 1>side to side,</v>

121
00:02:49.021 --> 00:02:50.100
<v Speaker 1>all that head movement.</v>

122
00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.660
<v Speaker 1>You mean you can't look at that.</v>

123
00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.560
<v Speaker 1>You can't even touch him listed with lunge forward with that Jab.</v>

124
00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:56.723
<v Speaker 1>Good luck.</v>

125
00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>Now here he gets him with a punch like right as he tries to listen,</v>

126
00:02:59.981 --> 00:03:04.930
<v Speaker 1>tries to crowd them and it happens with Ali's face to the camera.</v>

127
00:03:04.931 --> 00:03:09.250
<v Speaker 1>So listens back to the camera and he just comes with an overhand right.</v>

128
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.500
<v Speaker 1>And as soon as he catches listed on the draw,</v>

129
00:03:11.501 --> 00:03:14.140
<v Speaker 1>listening goes down like he got shot.</v>

130
00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:15.340
<v Speaker 1>I think it's right here.</v>

131
00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:17.743
<v Speaker 2>Right here.</v>

132
00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:21.360
<v Speaker 1>Whenever it is.</v>

133
00:03:21.361 --> 00:03:22.380
<v Speaker 1>It's when listens.</v>

134
00:03:22.381 --> 00:03:23.290
<v Speaker 1>Backs too.</v>

135
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.600
<v Speaker 1>But look how beautiful Ali moves,</v>

136
00:03:27.601 --> 00:03:27.981
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

137
00:03:27.981 --> 00:03:28.770
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

138
00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean he really did float and this is the real Ali.</v>

139
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.420
<v Speaker 1>This is the Ali of 1965 you know before the army and all that.</v>

140
00:03:36.691 --> 00:03:36.991
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

141
00:03:36.991 --> 00:03:37.381
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

142
00:03:37.381 --> 00:03:38.700
<v Speaker 1>the army fucked him.</v>

143
00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.730
<v Speaker 1>That whole thing fucked him because for three years from 1967 to 1970 he was</v>

144
00:03:44.461 --> 00:03:45.540
<v Speaker 1>completely out of commend.</v>

145
00:03:45.541 --> 00:03:46.710
<v Speaker 1>Shed is total prime.</v>

146
00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:47.723
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

147
00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.421
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

148
00:03:48.421 --> 00:03:48.661
<v Speaker 1>watch.</v>

149
00:03:48.661 --> 00:03:49.800
<v Speaker 1>We'll show the difference here.</v>

150
00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.710
<v Speaker 1>When when he finally catches like listen,</v>

151
00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.440
<v Speaker 1>even though listens moving towards him,</v>

152
00:03:55.441 --> 00:03:56.274
<v Speaker 1>he didn't,</v>

153
00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.001
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't even live here.</v>

154
00:03:57.001 --> 00:03:57.834
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to hit him.</v>

155
00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:59.790
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if they had like a,</v>

156
00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.580
<v Speaker 1>they gave him a time where he had to get knocked out too.</v>

157
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean it must be probably the first robbery cause all the gambling on it.</v>

158
00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:07.111
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

159
00:04:07.111 --> 00:04:08.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean that was everything.</v>

160
00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:10.923
<v Speaker 2>Here it is.</v>

161
00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.370
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>

162
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:13.203
<v Speaker 2>Right there.</v>

163
00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:16.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean that this is the fucking way.</v>

164
00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.440
<v Speaker 1>There's is no fucking way.</v>

165
00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:19.130
<v Speaker 1>But look,</v>

166
00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.670
<v Speaker 1>we'll shit,</v>

167
00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:21.020
<v Speaker 1>the way he's going down,</v>

168
00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:23.240
<v Speaker 1>the way he gets up.</v>

169
00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.771
<v Speaker 1>Oh look,</v>

170
00:04:24.771 --> 00:04:25.520
<v Speaker 1>he's fake.</v>

171
00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.370
<v Speaker 1>He could see him thinking I should probably fall down here.</v>

172
00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.030
<v Speaker 1>And he gets up finally and Jersey.</v>

173
00:04:33.031 --> 00:04:35.190
<v Speaker 1>Joe Walcott as a referee to I believe.</v>

174
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.900
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

175
00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:36.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

176
00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.450
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

177
00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:37.283
<v Speaker 1>Walcott</v>

178
00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.490
<v Speaker 1>and something happened there and now Ali's is tuning them up and then they</v>

179
00:04:44.501 --> 00:04:45.340
<v Speaker 1>stopped the fight.</v>

180
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.233
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

181
00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:48.580
<v Speaker 1>So I guess he had reached a 10 power.</v>

182
00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:49.001
<v Speaker 1>Got that.</v>

183
00:04:49.001 --> 00:04:50.110
<v Speaker 1>He got up after that.</v>

184
00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.030
<v Speaker 1>Here's the knockout in slow motion.</v>

185
00:04:53.031 --> 00:04:53.864
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

186
00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.231
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

187
00:04:54.231 --> 00:04:55.100
<v Speaker 1>he does hit them.</v>

188
00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.600
<v Speaker 1>Everybody calls it the Phantom Punch.</v>

189
00:04:56.601 --> 00:04:57.470
<v Speaker 1>But watch this punch.</v>

190
00:04:57.471 --> 00:04:59.650
<v Speaker 1>He definitely does hit him as listed.</v>

191
00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:00.291
<v Speaker 1>Moves forward.</v>

192
00:05:00.291 --> 00:05:01.124
<v Speaker 1>He does.</v>

193
00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:01.521
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

194
00:05:01.521 --> 00:05:03.260
<v Speaker 1>See clean hit.</v>

195
00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.520
<v Speaker 1>No doubt about it.</v>

196
00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:07.990
<v Speaker 1>He definitely tagged him,</v>

197
00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:09.520
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't,</v>

198
00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.290
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't the kind of punch that would put a guy glistens out.</v>

199
00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:14.610
<v Speaker 1>It'll probably stun him,</v>

200
00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:16.500
<v Speaker 1>but I just,</v>

201
00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:17.050
<v Speaker 1>it did.</v>

202
00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.700
<v Speaker 1>I didn't believe that that was a real one.</v>

203
00:05:18.701 --> 00:05:19.534
<v Speaker 1>Punch knockout.</v>

204
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.720
<v Speaker 1>Now watch that and I'll watch,</v>

205
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:23.633
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

206
00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.860
<v Speaker 1>he came back against the White Dude Jerry quarry.</v>

207
00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.471
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

208
00:05:29.471 --> 00:05:30.130
<v Speaker 1>If that was his,</v>

209
00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:31.300
<v Speaker 1>that was his comeback fight.</v>

210
00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:32.950
<v Speaker 1>Muhammad Ali versus Jerry Quarry.</v>

211
00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.200
<v Speaker 1>And when he fought Jerry quarry,</v>

212
00:05:35.201 --> 00:05:40.170
<v Speaker 1>this was an after he had taken all that time off and his body just looked</v>

213
00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.961
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

214
00:05:40.961 --> 00:05:41.794
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

215
00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:42.880
<v Speaker 1>He just like Jerry.</v>

216
00:05:42.881 --> 00:05:46.830
<v Speaker 1>Cory was like a really tough guy who by the way before he died,</v>

217
00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.700
<v Speaker 1>couldn't even figure out how to walk.</v>

218
00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.440
<v Speaker 1>Like you couldn't figure out where he was.</v>

219
00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:51.850
<v Speaker 1>Didn't know where his underwear was.</v>

220
00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:52.061
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

221
00:05:52.061 --> 00:05:52.930
<v Speaker 1>he was gone.</v>

222
00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:53.180
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

223
00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:53.561
<v Speaker 1>he didn't know,</v>

224
00:05:53.561 --> 00:05:55.240
<v Speaker 1>couldn't give you walked out his front door.</v>

225
00:05:55.241 --> 00:05:56.470
<v Speaker 1>It never make it back inside.</v>

226
00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:57.920
<v Speaker 1>He was just gone.</v>

227
00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:59.080
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

228
00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.290
<v Speaker 1>all these target Daumier.</v>

229
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.630
<v Speaker 1>But if like if you look at Ollie's body,</v>

230
00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:04.100
<v Speaker 1>like as Ali goes back,</v>

231
00:06:04.101 --> 00:06:07.160
<v Speaker 1>the thing about Ali was that if he wasn't training for a fight,</v>

232
00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:08.360
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't working out.</v>

233
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.140
<v Speaker 1>So he didn't spend those three years lifting weights and running hills and</v>

234
00:06:12.141 --> 00:06:13.220
<v Speaker 1>fucking hitting the heavy bag.</v>

235
00:06:13.221 --> 00:06:14.720
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't doing anything.</v>

236
00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:15.081
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

237
00:06:15.081 --> 00:06:20.000
<v Speaker 1>he's probably just just fighting to keep from getting locked up in jail,</v>

238
00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:21.020
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

239
00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:22.550
<v Speaker 1>But if you look at his body like look at it,</v>

240
00:06:22.551 --> 00:06:24.860
<v Speaker 1>he's all smooth and there's no muscles,</v>

241
00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:25.521
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

242
00:06:25.521 --> 00:06:26.180
<v Speaker 1>look at him.</v>

243
00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:27.290
<v Speaker 1>He looks like shit.</v>

244
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.341
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

245
00:06:28.341 --> 00:06:30.860
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't look anything like he used to look.</v>

246
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.551
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's,</v>

247
00:06:31.551 --> 00:06:34.010
<v Speaker 1>he's bouncing around a little bit in the beginning,</v>

248
00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:37.190
<v Speaker 1>but he's just not the same guy.</v>

249
00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.080
<v Speaker 1>They still had some pretty big fights at the end.</v>

250
00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:39.471
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

251
00:06:39.471 --> 00:06:39.981
<v Speaker 1>he did.</v>

252
00:06:39.981 --> 00:06:41.270
<v Speaker 1>But he was never the same guy.</v>

253
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:44.940
<v Speaker 1>I never forget that Larry Holmes trying to get the ref stopped the fight because</v>

254
00:06:44.941 --> 00:06:46.130
<v Speaker 1>they didn't want to beat him up anymore.</v>

255
00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:46.911
<v Speaker 1>That was awful.</v>

256
00:06:46.911 --> 00:06:47.960
<v Speaker 1>It was his idol.</v>

257
00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:53.170
<v Speaker 1>That was awful because that was after Ali had no money left and he was really</v>

258
00:06:53.781 --> 00:06:55.490
<v Speaker 1>suffering from Parkinson's already.</v>

259
00:06:55.491 --> 00:06:56.240
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

260
00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:56.581
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

261
00:06:56.581 --> 00:06:57.740
<v Speaker 1>I was already kicked in.</v>

262
00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:01.070
<v Speaker 1>He was already in really bad shape.</v>

263
00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:01.470
<v Speaker 1>Weight.</v>

264
00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:01.610
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

265
00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:02.421
<v Speaker 1>is a friend of mine.</v>

266
00:07:02.421 --> 00:07:05.740
<v Speaker 1>We used to work as Dorman together and the doc Watson's in Philly.</v>

267
00:07:05.741 --> 00:07:10.741
<v Speaker 1>It was Randall Cobb tax caught and we saw him take a beat and from homes.</v>

268
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:11.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

269
00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:14.030
<v Speaker 1>we were just going to go down Randall go down.</v>

270
00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:14.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

271
00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:15.680
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking horrible.</v>

272
00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.920
<v Speaker 1>That was the fight that made Howard Cosell retire from boxing.</v>

273
00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:20.083
<v Speaker 1>I remember that.</v>

274
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:21.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm done.</v>

275
00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.690
<v Speaker 1>Let no mo look at that little monkey run</v>

276
00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:29.720
<v Speaker 1>our co Sal who called like some of the greatest fights of all time.</v>

277
00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:31.460
<v Speaker 1>But like if you look at Ali here,</v>

278
00:07:31.461 --> 00:07:32.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's still looks good,</v>

279
00:07:32.811 --> 00:07:34.120
<v Speaker 1>but it's just not the same.</v>

280
00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:36.380
<v Speaker 1>Ali just not the same guy.</v>

281
00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:37.581
<v Speaker 1>He just,</v>

282
00:07:37.581 --> 00:07:39.050
<v Speaker 1>his body doesn't look the same.</v>

283
00:07:39.051 --> 00:07:39.950
<v Speaker 1>You smooth.</v>

284
00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:40.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

285
00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:42.380
<v Speaker 1>granted he's had three years off,</v>

286
00:07:42.381 --> 00:07:43.214
<v Speaker 1>but he's just,</v>

287
00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:44.001
<v Speaker 1>I mean the,</v>

288
00:07:44.001 --> 00:07:49.001
<v Speaker 1>the old Ali go now to Ali versus Cleveland Big Cat Williams.</v>

289
00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:50.091
<v Speaker 1>And I've always said,</v>

290
00:07:50.091 --> 00:07:51.530
<v Speaker 1>if you want to look at it like Ali,</v>

291
00:07:51.531 --> 00:07:52.490
<v Speaker 1>in his prime,</v>

292
00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:54.380
<v Speaker 1>when Ali was in his prime,</v>

293
00:07:54.381 --> 00:07:54.561
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

294
00:07:54.561 --> 00:07:55.670
<v Speaker 1>when he was fighting this guy,</v>

295
00:07:55.671 --> 00:07:59.210
<v Speaker 1>Cleveland Williams and Cleveland Williams is this big fucking scary,</v>

296
00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:03.140
<v Speaker 1>murderous puncher and Mohammed Ali box.</v>

297
00:08:03.141 --> 00:08:05.120
<v Speaker 1>This guy's fucking face off.</v>

298
00:08:05.121 --> 00:08:06.150
<v Speaker 1>Who is the one that he,</v>

299
00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:07.260
<v Speaker 1>when he was doing a,</v>

300
00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:07.941
<v Speaker 1>what's my name?</v>

301
00:08:07.941 --> 00:08:08.774
<v Speaker 1>What's my name?</v>

302
00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:09.621
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

303
00:08:09.621 --> 00:08:11.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm shit.</v>

304
00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:11.923
<v Speaker 1>Remember that?</v>

305
00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:12.840
<v Speaker 1>Because the guy wouldn't,</v>

306
00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:15.140
<v Speaker 1>clay called him calling him Cassius clay.</v>

307
00:08:15.141 --> 00:08:15.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

308
00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:16.343
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

309
00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:18.530
<v Speaker 1>I forget who that was.</v>

310
00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:19.640
<v Speaker 1>God Damn.</v>

311
00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:20.910
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to look at his records,</v>

312
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:22.560
<v Speaker 1>but Cleveland when was like,</v>

313
00:08:22.561 --> 00:08:22.681
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

314
00:08:22.681 --> 00:08:23.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm muscular Williams.</v>

315
00:08:23.811 --> 00:08:28.760
<v Speaker 1>His Mo Williams is a fucking animal murderous puncher and he just could not</v>

316
00:08:28.761 --> 00:08:29.361
<v Speaker 1>catch Holly.</v>

317
00:08:29.361 --> 00:08:30.740
<v Speaker 1>This is Ali and his prime.</v>

318
00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:32.213
<v Speaker 1>This is Ali,</v>

319
00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:34.540
<v Speaker 1>like in 67 he was asleep.</v>

320
00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:35.160
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

321
00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:35.993
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

322
00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:38.090
<v Speaker 1>but the movement decided to side.</v>

323
00:08:38.091 --> 00:08:41.150
<v Speaker 1>It was like there was no fucking heavyweights at ever move to like that.</v>

324
00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:42.170
<v Speaker 1>No one,</v>

325
00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:42.621
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

326
00:08:42.621 --> 00:08:47.621
<v Speaker 1>he literally moved faster and lighter on it's feet then most welterweights and</v>

327
00:08:47.931 --> 00:08:49.850
<v Speaker 1>he was fighting a 200 plus pounds.</v>

328
00:08:49.851 --> 00:08:50.031
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

329
00:08:50.031 --> 00:08:51.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what he weighed in his prime.</v>

330
00:08:51.291 --> 00:08:53.810
<v Speaker 1>It's probably probably about two 20 or something like that.</v>

331
00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:55.530
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever see that picture of him in the Beatles?</v>

332
00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:57.270
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Classic picture.</v>

335
00:08:58.601 --> 00:09:00.150
<v Speaker 1>Just him at the Beatles in Miami.</v>

336
00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:01.770
<v Speaker 1>Just a funny thing.</v>

337
00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:06.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to find out who that guy was that did that.</v>

338

<v Speaker 1>I know my name.</v>

339
00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:11.160
<v Speaker 1>Early careers got a bit of a process.</v>

340
00:09:11.161 --> 00:09:11.994
<v Speaker 1>Cleveland.</v>

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:16.170
<v Speaker 1>Sugar Ray Robinson had that.</v>

346
00:09:16.171 --> 00:09:18.510

360
00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:37.291
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy Ellis.</v>

361
00:09:37.291 --> 00:09:38.124
<v Speaker 1>That's what it was.</v>

362
00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:38.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

363
00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:38.910
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Pretty sure.</v>

365
00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:41.250
<v Speaker 1>Pretty sure it's Jimmy Ellis.</v>

366
00:09:41.251 --> 00:09:43.740
<v Speaker 1>Did you deal with as a sparring page and two?</v>

367
00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:44.641
<v Speaker 1>It probably was.</v>

368
00:09:44.641 --> 00:09:45.750
<v Speaker 1>That's probably what happened.</v>

369
00:09:45.751 --> 00:09:47.720
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't knock 'em out cause he was so mad at him.</v>

370
00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:49.230
<v Speaker 1>Just beat his ass.</v>

371
00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:51.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm almost positive was Ellis.</v>

372
00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:55.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure somebody will curve back to me if I'm wrong,</v>

373
00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:55.961
<v Speaker 1>but if you,</v>

374
00:09:55.961 --> 00:09:56.610
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

375
00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:57.540
<v Speaker 1>you watched his fight,</v>

376
00:09:57.570 --> 00:09:58.650
<v Speaker 1>this in my opinion,</v>

377
00:09:58.651 --> 00:10:00.870
<v Speaker 1>was like the quintessential Ali and this was,</v>

378
00:10:00.871 --> 00:10:03.780
<v Speaker 1>I believe the last fight before he went away.</v>

379
00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:05.483
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

380
00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:08.700
<v Speaker 1>they just had never seen anybody like this guy before.</v>

381
00:10:08.701 --> 00:10:11.400
<v Speaker 1>He do in those three years that he wasn't in prison?</v>

382
00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:12.031
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

383
00:10:12.031 --> 00:10:13.620
<v Speaker 1>I think actually I think he fought,</v>

384
00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:16.080
<v Speaker 1>they fought two more times and then he went,</v>

385
00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:16.770
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

386
00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:18.810
<v Speaker 1>he fought Ernie Terrell and then Zara Foley.</v>

387
00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:19.953
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

388
00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:21.060
<v Speaker 1>he went to,</v>

389
00:10:21.061 --> 00:10:21.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

390
00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:22.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

391
00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:24.330
<v Speaker 1>he had to fucking go to court and they look at this,</v>

392
00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:25.441
<v Speaker 1>God damn,</v>

393
00:10:25.441 --> 00:10:26.310
<v Speaker 1>he was fast.</v>

394
00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:27.510
<v Speaker 1>Look at this,</v>

395
00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:28.343
<v Speaker 1>the legs,</v>

396
00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:29.370
<v Speaker 1>pap,</v>

397
00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:29.990
<v Speaker 1>pap,</v>

398
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:30.230
<v Speaker 1>pap,</v>

399
00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:31.063
<v Speaker 1>pap pap,</v>

400
00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:32.190
<v Speaker 1>and then out of there,</v>

401
00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:33.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was,</v>

402
00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:34.950
<v Speaker 1>he was barely getting hit back then,</v>

403
00:10:34.951 --> 00:10:35.490
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

404
00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:36.990
<v Speaker 1>It was so fucking quick.</v>

405
00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:39.090
<v Speaker 1>And then you see like his later fights,</v>

406
00:10:39.091 --> 00:10:40.500
<v Speaker 1>like when he fought Joe Frazier,</v>

407
00:10:40.501 --> 00:10:42.450
<v Speaker 1>like rumble in the jungle and you know,</v>

408
00:10:42.451 --> 00:10:42.961
<v Speaker 1>there was just,</v>

409
00:10:42.961 --> 00:10:44.760
<v Speaker 1>it was so much slower afoot.</v>

410
00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:47.160
<v Speaker 1>Probably had knee problems by then.</v>

411
00:10:47.161 --> 00:10:47.731
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

412
00:10:47.731 --> 00:10:48.270
<v Speaker 1>he took a,</v>

413
00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:49.140
<v Speaker 1>and from Frazier,</v>

414
00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:51.060
<v Speaker 1>they took a beating from each other.</v>

415
00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:51.301
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

416
00:10:51.301 --> 00:10:52.710
<v Speaker 1>those were horrendous fights.</v>

417
00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:54.330
<v Speaker 1>Those are horrendous fights.</v>

418
00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:55.800
<v Speaker 1>His daughter told me it may.</v>

419
00:10:55.801 --> 00:10:56.760
<v Speaker 1>May is a friend of mine,</v>

420
00:10:56.761 --> 00:10:58.200
<v Speaker 1>his daughter remember meeting her.</v>

421
00:10:58.201 --> 00:10:59.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure she was always at the store.</v>

422
00:10:59.521 --> 00:11:00.071
<v Speaker 1>She's a comic,</v>

423
00:11:00.071 --> 00:11:00.300
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

424
00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:00.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

425
00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:01.410
<v Speaker 1>I used this.</v>

426
00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:06.090
<v Speaker 1>I remember the first time I brought her up and I said in about,</v>

427
00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:06.660
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

428
00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:07.890
<v Speaker 1>she brought me up and I said,</v>

429
00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:09.000
<v Speaker 1>maybe in La.</v>

430
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:09.720
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

431
00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:10.021
<v Speaker 1>I always,</v>

432
00:11:10.021 --> 00:11:10.400
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking,</v>

433
00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:12.780
<v Speaker 1>thinking in the back of wonder if I could beat all these daughter in a fight,</v>

434
00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:15.350
<v Speaker 1>I probably not.</v>

435
00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:16.883
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

436
00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:21.540

437
00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:22.800
<v Speaker 1>She'll beat the shit out of here.</v>

438
00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:23.753
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

439
00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:25.021
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful.</v>

442
00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:30.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

443
00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:30.781
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

444
00:11:30.781 --> 00:11:31.111
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

445
00:11:31.111 --> 00:11:31.470
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

446
00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:31.681
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

447
00:11:31.681 --> 00:11:35.400
<v Speaker 1>he's got a son too that comes around the comedy store or it used to come around</v>

448
00:11:35.401 --> 00:11:36.570
<v Speaker 1>the comedy store back in the day.</v>

449
00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:37.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember that.</v>

450
00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:37.561
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

451
00:11:37.561 --> 00:11:40.020
<v Speaker 1>And May may introduce me to him one day and I was like,</v>

452
00:11:40.021 --> 00:11:40.501
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

453
00:11:40.501 --> 00:11:42.300
<v Speaker 1>this dude looks exactly like Muhammad Ali.</v>

454
00:11:42.301 --> 00:11:43.170
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy.</v>

455
00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:44.941
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

456
00:11:44.941 --> 00:11:46.470
<v Speaker 1>at the time he was fairly young,</v>

457
00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:47.613
<v Speaker 1>big kid,</v>

458
00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:47.941
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

459
00:11:47.941 --> 00:11:48.774
<v Speaker 1>this was like,</v>

460
00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:50.490
<v Speaker 1>I want to say 10 years ago maybe,</v>

461
00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:56.210
<v Speaker 1>but Cleveland Williams was like this like perfect style fighter to show like</v>

462
00:11:57.581 --> 00:11:59.170
<v Speaker 1>Muhammad Ali in his best.</v>

463
00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:01.060
<v Speaker 1>Like he just wasn't there man.</v>

464
00:12:01.061 --> 00:12:01.960
<v Speaker 1>He's just wasn't there.</v>

465
00:12:01.961 --> 00:12:03.400
<v Speaker 1>It was not nearly as quick.</v>

466
00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:04.390
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man.</v>

467
00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:05.253
<v Speaker 1>Like look at this,</v>

468
00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:06.010
<v Speaker 1>look at that.</v>

469
00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:06.940
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

470
00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:12.120
<v Speaker 1>He was so slick and he just redefined what it meant to be a professional boxer.</v>

471
00:12:13.871 --> 00:12:18.580
<v Speaker 1>He introduced a whole new way of doing it and now like there's a lot of MMA</v>

472
00:12:18.581 --> 00:12:20.770
<v Speaker 1>fighters that use this style now.</v>

473
00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:24.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's different because they throw kicks and because takedowns are</v>

474
00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:25.691
<v Speaker 1>incorporated into it,</v>

475
00:12:25.691 --> 00:12:26.830
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of what they call,</v>

476
00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:31.390
<v Speaker 1>they call it neo footwork movements like Dominick Cruz is probably the best at</v>

477
00:12:31.391 --> 00:12:31.510
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

478
00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:36.010
<v Speaker 1>He's the former bantamweight champion and Tj Dillashaw who's a current</v>

479
00:12:36.011 --> 00:12:36.821
<v Speaker 1>bantamweight champion.</v>

480
00:12:36.821 --> 00:12:41.821
<v Speaker 1>Both guys are a great examples of people that use this kind of misdirection and</v>

481
00:12:42.401 --> 00:12:44.350
<v Speaker 1>footwork like constantly left to right,</v>

482
00:12:44.351 --> 00:12:45.184
<v Speaker 1>right to left.</v>

483
00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:48.580
<v Speaker 1>But those guys also incorporates switching stances.</v>

484
00:12:48.581 --> 00:12:48.821
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

485
00:12:48.821 --> 00:12:51.580
<v Speaker 1>they'll fight southpaw and then orthodox and Orthodox south by,</v>

486
00:12:51.581 --> 00:12:52.480
<v Speaker 1>they go back and forth.</v>

487
00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:56.530
<v Speaker 1>I'll get this Ali just right in front of this dude and he can't do shit to him.</v>

488
00:12:58.070 --> 00:12:58.510
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

489
00:12:58.510 --> 00:12:59.410
<v Speaker 1>go to the knockout.</v>

490
00:12:59.411 --> 00:13:00.190
<v Speaker 1>We see.</v>

491
00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:01.023
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where,</v>

492
00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:02.500
<v Speaker 1>where it is on this video.</v>

493
00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:04.300
<v Speaker 1>It's can't be much further than this.</v>

494
00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:05.740
<v Speaker 1>When's your next fight Joe?</v>

495
00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:09.880
<v Speaker 1>The next UFC is next weekend is a big one too.</v>

496
00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:12.300
<v Speaker 1>Chris Weidman versus Vitor Belfort.</v>

497
00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:13.090
<v Speaker 1>Vegas.</v>

498
00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:13.871
<v Speaker 1>He'll get this dang.</v>

499
00:13:13.871 --> 00:13:14.470
<v Speaker 1>Dang.</v>

500
00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:15.910
<v Speaker 1>Oh son.</v>

501
00:13:15.911 --> 00:13:17.410
<v Speaker 1>He stands over when his hands up.</v>

502
00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:19.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

503
00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:20.201
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

504
00:13:20.201 --> 00:13:20.470
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

505
00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:21.610
<v Speaker 1>that's real.</v>

506
00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:22.900
<v Speaker 1>So that's the way he's breathing.</v>

507
00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:25.780
<v Speaker 1>Very different than the way Sonny Liston went down.</v>

508
00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:26.291
<v Speaker 1>See that again?</v>

509
00:13:26.291 --> 00:13:27.360
<v Speaker 1>Back it up again too.</v>

510
00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:27.820
<v Speaker 1>There was,</v>

511
00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:29.830
<v Speaker 1>I believe he got knocked down twice.</v>

512
00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:30.430
<v Speaker 1>I might,</v>

513
00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:31.263
<v Speaker 1>I might be wrong.</v>

514
00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:32.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

515
00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:34.090
<v Speaker 1>he got knocked down twice.</v>

516
00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:35.793
<v Speaker 1>So look,</v>

517
00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:36.700
<v Speaker 1>this is don't,</v>

518
00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:37.300
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

519
00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:38.260
<v Speaker 1>back it up a little bit.</v>

520
00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:38.861
<v Speaker 1>You could see the,</v>

521
00:13:38.861 --> 00:13:39.130
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

522
00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:39.963
<v Speaker 1>the flurry.</v>

523
00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:41.951
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

524
00:13:41.951 --> 00:13:42.701
<v Speaker 1>it was three times.</v>

525
00:13:42.701 --> 00:13:44.080
<v Speaker 1>He got knocked down three times.</v>

526
00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:45.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

527
00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:47.050
<v Speaker 1>And then eventually put away.</v>

528
00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:48.101
<v Speaker 1>But he's just,</v>

529
00:13:48.101 --> 00:13:48.401
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

530
00:13:48.401 --> 00:13:49.540
<v Speaker 1>kept trying to chase him,</v>

531
00:13:49.541 --> 00:13:49.931
<v Speaker 1>chase him,</v>

532
00:13:49.931 --> 00:13:50.351
<v Speaker 1>chase him,</v>

533
00:13:50.351 --> 00:13:50.800
<v Speaker 1>pumping.</v>

534
00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:52.990
<v Speaker 1>He knocked him down walking away.</v>

535
00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:54.311
<v Speaker 1>God Damn,</v>

536
00:13:54.311 --> 00:13:55.210
<v Speaker 1>that was beautiful.</v>

537
00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:56.200
<v Speaker 1>The way he did that.</v>

538
00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:57.093
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

539
00:13:57.450 --> 00:13:58.570
<v Speaker 1>I watched his fight.</v>

540
00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:03.550
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many times is this one of my favorite all time performance is</v>

541
00:14:03.551 --> 00:14:04.384
<v Speaker 1>of any box.</v>

542
00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:13.690
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
