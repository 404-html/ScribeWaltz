00:00:46.781 --> 00:00:49.120
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did you get into this?</v>

23
00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.220
<v Speaker 1>I kind of grew up doing it.</v>

24
00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.990
<v Speaker 1>Tell you the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a family.</v>

25
00:00:52.991 --> 00:00:55.480
<v Speaker 1>He made a nature documentaries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so as a family unit,</v>

26
00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.540
<v Speaker 1>that's what we did for a living and so I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was traveling from.</v>

27
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.340
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the moment I could walk basically.</v>

28
00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.250
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is cool.</v>

29
00:01:03.251 --> 00:01:08.251
<v Speaker 1>What is your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your dad is like a filmmaker or </v>

30
00:01:08.251 --> 00:01:08.251
<v Speaker 1>something?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

31
00:01:08.251 --> 00:01:08.900
<v Speaker 1>I your mom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should say your mom or your dad?</v>

32
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm so solid family unit sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about,</v>

33
00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.400
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you explain that in a nutshell?</v>

34
00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.420
<v Speaker 1>He kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Australian Jacques Cousteau,</v>

35
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.640
<v Speaker 1>maybe the Australian version of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he started off as a shock content </v>

36
00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.760
<v Speaker 1>back in the sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was actually putting shocks and </v>

37
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.760
<v Speaker 1>putting that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm filming it,</v>

38
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.061
<v Speaker 1>putting it on TV with Leonard Nimoy was </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrating spock was actually narrating </v>

39
00:01:34.061 --> 00:01:36.600
<v Speaker 1>them back in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'll never be anything but sparked.</v>

40
00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:37.570
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

41
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.910
<v Speaker 1>I love that place.</v>

42
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.210
<v Speaker 1>You get fucked man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a role too.</v>

43
00:01:42.211 --> 00:01:43.610
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

44
00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.010
<v Speaker 1>and then he turned conservationist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

45
00:01:46.011 --> 00:01:50.890
<v Speaker 1>after probably bid sixties or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he was a hunter.</v>

46
00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.960
<v Speaker 1>So he was going out and killing sharks </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he,</v>

47
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.120
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what made him sort of shift into </v>

48
00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.961
<v Speaker 1>conservation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was just a realization of </v>

49
00:02:00.961 --> 00:02:00.961
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

50
00:02:00.961 --> 00:02:00.961
<v Speaker 1>what a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what a waste,</v>

51
00:02:00.961 --> 00:02:02.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>killing shocks.</v>

52
00:02:02.111 --> 00:02:04.330
<v Speaker 1>And also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think after you spend enough time with</v>

53
00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.350
<v Speaker 1>sharks in the water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you realize they're not dangerous at </v>

54
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.350
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These things.</v>

55
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:10.690
<v Speaker 1>A magnificent creatures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not under most circumstances.</v>

56
00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do kill.</v>

57
00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:13.990
<v Speaker 1>They get hungry occasionally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

58
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean the problem is really we look </v>
<v Speaker 1>like seals on a surf board,</v>

59
00:02:17.351 --> 00:02:18.560
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then that's a real problem.</v>

60
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.000
<v Speaker 1>It's taking identity a nine times out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 mistaken identity.</v>

61
00:02:22.001 --> 00:02:27.001
<v Speaker 1>And the only way they can figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you are is by coming up and taking </v>

62
00:02:27.001 --> 00:02:28.300
<v Speaker 1>a little bite and surf board and </v>
<v Speaker 1>wetsuit.</v>

63
00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.060
<v Speaker 1>But that one little box can sometimes be</v>
<v Speaker 1>fate a killer.</v>

64
00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.660
<v Speaker 1>But it's very rare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very rare to get eaten by a shark.</v>

65
00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fairly rare.</v>

66
00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.910
<v Speaker 1>Not Rare enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once again,</v>

67
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should just clarify.</v>

68
00:02:45.671 --> 00:02:50.671
<v Speaker 1>I'm not in favor of killing sharks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not interested in eradicating them </v>

69
00:02:50.671 --> 00:02:51.880
<v Speaker 1>from the ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they scare the shit out of me,</v>

70
00:02:51.881 --> 00:02:52.870
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was uh,</v>

71
00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.680
<v Speaker 1>in California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in California now,</v>

72
00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.940
<v Speaker 1>but it was like a couple years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some guy,</v>

73
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:04.050
<v Speaker 1>this is my biggest fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some guy was swimming with a bunch of </v>

74
00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.931
<v Speaker 1>people that were training for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>triathlon and it was off the coast of </v>

75
00:03:06.931 --> 00:03:07.480
<v Speaker 1>San Diego and he was bitten in half in </v>
<v Speaker 1>front of everybody.</v>

76
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.760
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it does go down,</v>

77
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.470
<v Speaker 1>but perspective kill a hundred or 100 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million sharks a year.</v>

78
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.610
<v Speaker 1>Well now you and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so probably shouldn't we as humanity?</v>

79
00:03:21.611 --> 00:03:26.520
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Humanity kills 100 million in the suit.</v>

80
00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.800
<v Speaker 1>We killed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They killed maybe eight to 10 of us.</v>

81
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.800
<v Speaker 1>I think it's less than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like five.</v>

82
00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:38.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depends what you get the statistics </v>

83
00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.021
<v Speaker 1>from accounting because I mean most </v>
<v Speaker 1>Fatah fatalities and it comes to shock </v>

84
00:03:40.021 --> 00:03:40.021
<v Speaker 1>attacks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually.</v>

85
00:03:40.021 --> 00:03:44.941
<v Speaker 1>The Zambezi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bullshit because in Africa don't </v>

86
00:03:44.941 --> 00:03:44.941
<v Speaker 1>have great records.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

87
00:03:44.941 --> 00:03:46.720
<v Speaker 1>but I would say yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight to 10 per year.</v>

88
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.380
<v Speaker 1>The crazy thing about bull sharks is </v>
<v Speaker 1>they can live in freshwater,</v>

89
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:50.170
<v Speaker 1>like deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deep,</v>

90
00:03:50.171 --> 00:03:53.500
<v Speaker 1>deep in freshwater rivers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're kind of blind.</v>

91
00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.480
<v Speaker 1>They can only see about six inches in </v>
<v Speaker 1>front of their face.</v>

92
00:03:55.481 --> 00:03:58.330
<v Speaker 1>So they like rivers and dirty kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>

93
00:03:58.331 --> 00:04:00.600
<v Speaker 1>I spent two years swimming everyday with</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

94
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.720
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's about three meters.</v>

95
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.170
<v Speaker 1>Bull shock in captivity as soon as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>stood up the water,</v>

96
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.380
<v Speaker 1>she would come ride.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she loved it when it was murky </v>

97
00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.960
<v Speaker 1>because that's when she had the </v>
<v Speaker 1>advantage over the other animals.</v>

98
00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.370
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

99
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:13.090
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

100
00:04:13.091 --> 00:04:16.780
<v Speaker 1>the basis for the movie jaws was </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually a freshwater shark attack.</v>

101
00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.770
<v Speaker 1>It was baffling to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had no idea that sharks at the time</v>

102
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:26.070
<v Speaker 1>would even exist in fresh water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was in New Jersey and these </v>

103
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.361
<v Speaker 1>people are in a river and I think two </v>
<v Speaker 1>people were killed inside of a short </v>

104
00:04:30.361 --> 00:04:32.530
<v Speaker 1>period of time by bull sharks that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>swim,</v>

105
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.390
<v Speaker 1>swim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>swim,</v>

106
00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:35.920
<v Speaker 1>swim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>swim,</v>

107
00:04:35.921 --> 00:04:36.490
<v Speaker 1>sound,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

108
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.230
<v Speaker 1>swim up river and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fresh water.</v>

109
00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.100
<v Speaker 1>So these people were at our freshwater </v>
<v Speaker 1>beach by the river and they get killed.</v>

110
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.800
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's scared of the great white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

111
00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.830
<v Speaker 1>the big shock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you talk about the amount of a </v>

112
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:53.240
<v Speaker 1>tax bill shock is Fafa hm.</v>

113
00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:58.350
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you think it's because they're </v>

114
00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.350
<v Speaker 1>young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't see.</v>

115
00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.350
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's a mistaken identity thing.</v>

116
00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.350
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

117
00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.530
<v Speaker 1>once again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

118
00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.610
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they see you using the electrical,</v>

119
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>receptive.</v>

120
00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.240
<v Speaker 1>So that I can think of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see hot beating basically,</v>

121
00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.360
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't know what you are and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got really bad vision.</v>

122
00:05:07.361 --> 00:05:12.361
<v Speaker 1>So the only way you can figure out what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you are and whether your edible is to </v>

123
00:05:12.361 --> 00:05:13.410
<v Speaker 1>come and take a little bite and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

124
00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:15.400
<v Speaker 1>that little block sometimes can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>fatal.</v>

125
00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw something last night.</v>

126
00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.320
<v Speaker 1>I think it's got to be bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish I could remember the name of it,</v>

127
00:05:20.321 --> 00:05:25.321
<v Speaker 1>but it was a camouflage suit that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could wear while hunting that does not </v>

128
00:05:25.321 --> 00:05:30.000
<v Speaker 1>give out the electrical signal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was like a,</v>

129
00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.620
<v Speaker 1>it was close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was somehow or another.</v>

130
00:05:32.621 --> 00:05:37.621
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these clothes keep an electrical signal </v>

131
00:05:37.621 --> 00:05:38.350
<v Speaker 1>from like animals from seeing this </v>
<v Speaker 1>electrical signal.</v>

132
00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.420
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sounded like horseshit though.</v>

133
00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.100
<v Speaker 1>Well I mean there is some science that </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have a faraday cage suit.</v>

134
00:05:44.101 --> 00:05:46.320
<v Speaker 1>So what does it live in a Faraday cage?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>

135
00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.070
<v Speaker 1>The middle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically woven.</v>

136
00:05:48.071 --> 00:05:50.980
<v Speaker 1>That stops a electrical stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>

137
00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:56.280
<v Speaker 1>is that real make significant human </v>
<v Speaker 1>significantly less detectable by </v>

138
00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:56.360
<v Speaker 1>animals?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

139
00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:58.040
<v Speaker 1>it would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would sense for sure with</v>

140
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.020
<v Speaker 2>animals that have the electrical impulse</v>
<v Speaker 2>receptors like sharks do.</v>

141
00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.260
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

142
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:06.110
<v Speaker 2>sharks have that line on their body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

143
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:07.310
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

144
00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:12.400
<v Speaker 2>a all fish have a line going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lateral line going down in that detects </v>

145
00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:12.400
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

146
00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.410
<v Speaker 2>electrical impulses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sharks have on the nose.</v>

147
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:20.740
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a really hard word to pronounce </v>

148
00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:20.740
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look on trying,</v>

149
00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:21.170
<v Speaker 2>but they have this electrical receptor </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the front of their nose.</v>

150
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:24.920
<v Speaker 2>And so when a shark sees you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can actually see your heart beating.</v>

151
00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:30.840
<v Speaker 2>And so say you're swimming with sharks </v>
<v Speaker 2>and someone else next to you and you've </v>

152
00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:30.840
<v Speaker 2>been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

153
00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:31.910
<v Speaker 2>you've never been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've been swimming with sharks before.</v>

154
00:06:31.911 --> 00:06:33.170
<v Speaker 2>You pretty calm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So your heart's going,</v>

155
00:06:33.171 --> 00:06:33.430
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

156
00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:33.780
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

157
00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:34.140
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

158
00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:34.540
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>

159
00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.790
<v Speaker 2>Person next to you and never been </v>
<v Speaker 2>swimming with sharks before.</v>

160
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:38.450
<v Speaker 2>Freaking out their hearts going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

161
00:06:38.451 --> 00:06:38.630
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

162
00:06:38.631 --> 00:06:38.870
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

163
00:06:38.871 --> 00:06:39.000
<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>

164
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.650
<v Speaker 2>A million miles an hour that shark's </v>
<v Speaker 2>gonna swim up and go lunch person with a</v>

165
00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:45.770
<v Speaker 2>faster happy because they're stressed </v>
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>

166
00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.620
<v Speaker 2>they're going to be easier to catch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nature does not like bitches.</v>

167
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.740
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Panic like a bitch.</v>

168
00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:53.450
<v Speaker 2>Nature's like [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>

169
00:06:53.451 --> 00:06:56.240
<v Speaker 2>If you panic when you're in with sharks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll come right up to you.</v>

170
00:06:56.241 --> 00:06:57.770
<v Speaker 2>They want to check your animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

171
00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:03.070
<v Speaker 2>You ever seen people that just freak out</v>
<v Speaker 2>around dogs and dogs start barking at </v>

172
00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:03.070
<v Speaker 2>them and then another person come up </v>
<v Speaker 2>with that dog.</v>

173
00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:03.980
<v Speaker 2>Hey Buddy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on?</v>

174
00:07:03.981 --> 00:07:04.920
<v Speaker 2>You all right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

175
00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:05.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

176
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:10.010
<v Speaker 2>So your dad was a shark hunter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when he was hunting these sharks,</v>

177
00:07:10.011 --> 00:07:12.290
<v Speaker 2>was he doing it for food?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were they eating the sharks?</v>

178
00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:13.460
<v Speaker 2>This was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

179
00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:15.590
<v Speaker 2>you gotta remember this is back in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>

180
00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:16.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is kind of,</v>

181
00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:19.250
<v Speaker 2>and c's sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>early sixties.</v>

182
00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.880
<v Speaker 2>And back then it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was filming people killing,</v>

183
00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:23.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20,</v>

184
00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:25.220
<v Speaker 2>30 shocks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

185
00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:25.790
<v Speaker 2>at a time.</v>

186
00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:30.790
<v Speaker 2>And it was just a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was the first underwater documentaries </v>

187
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:33.830
<v Speaker 2>out there sort of showing that world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were using explosive headset,</v>

188
00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:36.320
<v Speaker 2>like a spear gun with a bullet 300,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three on the end of it.</v>

189
00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.390
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were shooting them that way.</v>

190
00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:39.200
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

191
00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:44.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I look at those videos now and some of </v>

192
00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:44.630
<v Speaker 2>the species that we're killing it just </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely harmless and it's just.</v>

193
00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:47.750
<v Speaker 2>And I guess it eventually to get to that</v>
<v Speaker 2>point where they turned around and went,</v>

194
00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:48.230
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hang on,</v>

195
00:07:48.231 --> 00:07:53.231
<v Speaker 2>this is bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so use that fame or that desire for </v>

196
00:07:53.231 --> 00:07:56.651
<v Speaker 2>this underwater footage and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then sort of take a conservation </v>

197
00:07:56.651 --> 00:07:56.660
<v Speaker 2>angle to it instead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there were,</v>

198
00:07:56.690 --> 00:08:00.080
<v Speaker 2>they initially doing it to eradicate </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous animals.</v>

199
00:08:00.081 --> 00:08:05.081
<v Speaker 2>Is that whether we're doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess there's that aspect of that to </v>

200
00:08:05.081 --> 00:08:05.540
<v Speaker 2>tell the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was just good tv.</v>

201
00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:06.260
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

202
00:08:06.261 --> 00:08:11.261
<v Speaker 2>So it was just let's go shoot some shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>and put it on television and here's </v>

203
00:08:11.261 --> 00:08:13.800
<v Speaker 2>sharks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And everyone's scared of them,</v>

204
00:08:13.801 --> 00:08:14.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

205
00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:17.510
<v Speaker 2>it was quite a natural thing back then </v>
<v Speaker 2>to go,</v>

206
00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:19.310
<v Speaker 2>you're scared of something could kill </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

207
00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:21.470
<v Speaker 2>And so your dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while you were young,</v>

208
00:08:21.471 --> 00:08:25.520
<v Speaker 2>became a conservationist and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>started taking you all around the world.</v>

209
00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we made these kinds of,</v>

210
00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:29.740
<v Speaker 2>one our nature documentaries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

211
00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:32.600
<v Speaker 2>they were shown in Australia on channel </v>
<v Speaker 2>seven over here,</v>

212
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:34.920
<v Speaker 2>Disney channel pick them up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

213
00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:38.930
<v Speaker 2>this trend around the world and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mainly underwater kind of adventure.</v>

214
00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:44.080
<v Speaker 2>I look back now and I actually think </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of reality TV to the truth </v>

215
00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:47.471
<v Speaker 2>because it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a documentary of a family going on </v>

216
00:08:47.471 --> 00:08:48.170
<v Speaker 2>an adventure and learning some stuff and</v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing some cool stuff on the way.</v>

217
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:51.350
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this has been your life all along?</v>

218
00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:52.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>

219
00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:58.070
<v Speaker 2>that's cool man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so how'd you get involved with </v>

220
00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:58.070
<v Speaker 2>nationally?</v>

221
00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:58.830
<v Speaker 1>You're a national geographic expedition </v>
<v Speaker 1>leader.</v>

222
00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:01.290
<v Speaker 1>I worked for a company called Linblad </v>
<v Speaker 1>expeditions,</v>

223
00:09:01.291 --> 00:09:06.291
<v Speaker 1>National Geographic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a partnership between Lindblad </v>

224
00:09:06.291 --> 00:09:09.111
<v Speaker 1>expeditions at National Geographic and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got a fleet of 10 vessels and we </v>

225
00:09:09.111 --> 00:09:12.090
<v Speaker 1>take people to the remotest places on it</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically.</v>

226
00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:17.180
<v Speaker 1>And so they graciously give me a </v>

<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>

237
00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.810
<v Speaker 1>it's a nice ship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a beautiful ship,</v>

238
00:09:42.811 --> 00:09:47.811
<v Speaker 1>national geographic or right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the best exhibition ships </v>

239
00:09:47.811 --> 00:09:47.811
<v Speaker 1>floating at this point in time.</v>

240
00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:52.850
<v Speaker 1>And so like when you go on these ships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what are the ultimate goals are to </v>

241
00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:57.051
<v Speaker 1>collect samples to view things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to take photographs to try to view rare </v>

242
00:09:57.051 --> 00:09:58.410
<v Speaker 1>species,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit of everything really.</v>

243
00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:03.460
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we have scientists on board doing </v>

244
00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:03.460
<v Speaker 1>some research and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

245
00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:03.980
<v Speaker 1>but we're also taking tourists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

246
00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:07.260
<v Speaker 1>we're taking people who are paying a </v>
<v Speaker 1>considerable amount of money.</v>

247
00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:09.110
<v Speaker 1>I can go to those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can go on a tour,</v>

248
00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:10.830
<v Speaker 1>official can come down to Antarctica </v>
<v Speaker 1>with me.</v>

249
00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:12.120
<v Speaker 1>Woo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's too cold.</v>

250
00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:13.830
<v Speaker 1>I want to go somewhere.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Rica where they invite me to that.</v>

252
00:10:16.621 --> 00:10:19.140
<v Speaker 1>That's bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to point out,</v>

253
00:10:19.141 --> 00:10:20.010
<v Speaker 1>I do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My friend down,</v>

254
00:10:20.011 --> 00:10:20.760

<v Speaker 1>Conrad said,</v>

255
00:10:20.761 --> 00:10:23.010
<v Speaker 1>make sure you invite joe down here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that your boat?</v>

256
00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:24.850
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

257
00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:27.720
<v Speaker 1>National Geographic or Ryan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're on a cruise ship.</v>

258
00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:28.950
<v Speaker 1>It's not a cruise ship.</v>

259
00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:33.120
<v Speaker 1>We have to be very specific about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just say it's not a cruise ship.</v>

260
00:10:33.121 --> 00:10:36.290
<v Speaker 1>That's a fucking cruise ship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's.</v>

261
00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:38.040
<v Speaker 1>There's a difference between expedition </v>
<v Speaker 1>and cruising.</v>

262
00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:39.990
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so a cruise ship goes to,</v>

263
00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:41.910
<v Speaker 1>goes to port,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deport you,</v>

264
00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:46.930
<v Speaker 1>you stop in at some town,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go after you explore the town for </v>

265
00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:46.930
<v Speaker 1>the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you come back,</v>

266
00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:47.610
<v Speaker 1>you jump on the ship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes to the next destination.</v>

267
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:51.180
<v Speaker 1>We don't go to towns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We go to places in between.</v>

268
00:10:51.181 --> 00:10:53.760
<v Speaker 1>We'd go to remote places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got 13 zodiacs onboard.</v>

269
00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:58.770
<v Speaker 1>So little small vessels to live in like </v>
<v Speaker 1>a gangster on this thing.</v>

270
00:10:58.771 --> 00:11:00.290
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

271
00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:02.080
<v Speaker 1>you got a hot tub.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

272
00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:05.760
<v Speaker 1>If you were a Russian oligarch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what I would expect.</v>

273
00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:08.070
<v Speaker 1>Look at these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are these rock piles?</v>

274
00:11:08.071 --> 00:11:10.090
<v Speaker 1>Why do you have rocks?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

275
00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:12.030
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got removed about last week.</v>

276
00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:17.270
<v Speaker 1>They got removed because they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do we have rocks that design 10 </v>

277
00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:17.910
<v Speaker 1>years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

278
00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:18.780
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>

279
00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:21.840
<v Speaker 1>So that's 2006.</v>

280
00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:25.400
<v Speaker 1>It's not like we're talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>twenties.</v>

281
00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:28.290
<v Speaker 1>Back then people didn't know any better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you had these,</v>

282
00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:33.380
<v Speaker 1>these rocks are there just for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Looks like it's going to kill me if I </v>

283
00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:37.301
<v Speaker 1>talk about the rocks too long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when a few weeks ago I saw them </v>

284
00:11:37.301 --> 00:11:38.610
<v Speaker 1>removing them so they're not been the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rocks near there.</v>

285
00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:41.160
<v Speaker 1>It seems like a lot of weight to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>carrying around just to look pretty.</v>

286
00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:43.650
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're fiberglass rocks.</v>

287
00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.000
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're fake rocks.</v>

288
00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:46.840
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't put rocks on top of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ship.</v>

289
00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:48.850
<v Speaker 1>Get these photos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys partying.</v>

290
00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:50.460
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a Jay z video.</v>

291
00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:52.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have cocktail parties all the time.</v>

292
00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:53.460
<v Speaker 1>Boop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boop.</v>

293
00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:58.470
<v Speaker 1>And Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a bad ass boat to be touring </v>

294
00:11:58.470 --> 00:12:01.921
<v Speaker 1>around with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spent new years dancing and partying </v>

295
00:12:01.921 --> 00:12:03.400
<v Speaker 1>on the ice in Antarctica.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

296
00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:05.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have some good parties on there.</v>

297
00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:05.650
<v Speaker 1>We do.</v>

298
00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:09.040
<v Speaker 1>Did you see any polar bears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>polar bears in Antarctica?</v>

299
00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:10.420
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not in Antarctica.</v>

300
00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.640
<v Speaker 1>That's penguins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Penguins.</v>

301
00:12:12.641 --> 00:12:14.960
<v Speaker 1>Penguins on the sound winds in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>north.</v>

302
00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:15.620
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

303
00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:18.220
<v Speaker 1>what kind of mammals do they have in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Antarctica though?</v>

304
00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:19.380
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots.</v>

305
00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:21.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean you've got all your different </v>
<v Speaker 1>well spaces.</v>

306
00:12:21.071 --> 00:12:23.140
<v Speaker 1>So blue whales,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fin whales say whales,</v>

307
00:12:23.141 --> 00:12:25.300
<v Speaker 1>humpback whales,</v>
<v Speaker 1>minke whales and orcas.</v>

308
00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:27.160
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

309
00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:30.060
<v Speaker 1>a lot of different dolphins as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then of course you seals,</v>

310
00:12:30.061 --> 00:12:33.130
<v Speaker 1>you pin a pitts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so elephant seals,</v>

311
00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:35.200
<v Speaker 1>a leopard suit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leopard seals.</v>

312
00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:40.250
<v Speaker 1>It seals a pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the wildest man I remember </v>

313
00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:42.841
<v Speaker 1>when I saw that in March of the penguins</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie and there's the first time I </v>

314
00:12:42.841 --> 00:12:46.021
<v Speaker 1>really found out about leopard seals or </v>
<v Speaker 1>had seen them in like a,</v>

315
00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:48.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high definition video form.</v>

316
00:12:48.581 --> 00:12:50.170
<v Speaker 1>I think maybe had seen a photograph of </v>
<v Speaker 1>him before,</v>

317
00:12:50.171 --> 00:12:53.710
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't realize like what a </v>
<v Speaker 1>majestic beasts they are,</v>

318
00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:56.950
<v Speaker 1>but a strange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost like a fake animal.</v>

319
00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:59.870
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even look real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think of him like a swimming jewel.</v>

320
00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:02.970
<v Speaker 1>Just this huge big Joel with massive </v>
<v Speaker 1>team there.</v>

321
00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:05.160
<v Speaker 1>See the size of the teeth on them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

322
00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:09.100
<v Speaker 1>they eat penguins and occasionally they </v>
<v Speaker 1>chew on the back of Zodiacs as well.</v>

323
00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:13.960
<v Speaker 1>Zodiacs or those boats?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have probably about one a year.</v>

324
00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:15.700
<v Speaker 1>They ended up chewing on the back of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zodiac.</v>

325
00:13:15.701 --> 00:13:18.790
<v Speaker 1>So because they're inflatable boat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why does they do that?</v>

326
00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:22.480
<v Speaker 1>To fuck with people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably just to fuck with people.</v>

327
00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.240
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're really weird because like,</v>

328
00:13:24.241 --> 00:13:29.241
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was one account that this </v>

329
00:13:29.241 --> 00:13:30.841
<v Speaker 1>photographer did a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was several days where he spent </v>

330
00:13:30.841 --> 00:13:34.501
<v Speaker 1>filming a female leopard seal and she </v>
<v Speaker 1>kept bringing him penguins to eat.</v>

331
00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:36.460
<v Speaker 1>And He.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you heard of this?</v>

332
00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:38.380
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was really fascinating because,</v>

333
00:13:38.381 --> 00:13:39.670
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was terrified,</v>

334
00:13:39.671 --> 00:13:41.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this monstrous,</v>

335
00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:43.870
<v Speaker 1>enormous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>predatory and have respect for them.</v>

336
00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:45.220
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're huge.</v>

337
00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:50.430
<v Speaker 1>And she kept bringing him like dead </v>
<v Speaker 1>penguins and like bringing it to my,</v>

338
00:13:50.531 --> 00:13:51.190
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat it,</v>

339
00:13:51.191 --> 00:13:53.230
<v Speaker 1>bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he,</v>

340
00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:58.520
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess she felt bad for him or she was </v>

341
00:13:58.520 --> 00:13:58.870
<v Speaker 1>just trying to make friends with them or</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of strange thing,</v>

342
00:13:58.871 --> 00:14:03.730
<v Speaker 1>like she's not in a position where she </v>
<v Speaker 1>was famished where she didn't have.</v>

343
00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:06.400
<v Speaker 1>She had plenty of food so she wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking to eat him,</v>

344
00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:08.680
<v Speaker 1>so she just decided to help him and try </v>
<v Speaker 1>to feed him.</v>

345
00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:10.090
<v Speaker 1>It was very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very strange.</v>

346
00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:15.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the golden rule with sort of biology is </v>

347
00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:18.030
<v Speaker 1>don't put human emotions onto animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the closer you look at animals,</v>

348
00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:20.410
<v Speaker 1>more time you spend with the animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see these emotions,</v>

349
00:14:20.411 --> 00:14:22.660
<v Speaker 1>you see elements of culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

350
00:14:22.661 --> 00:14:24.490
<v Speaker 1>some stuff going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

351
00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:25.750
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't give him enough respect.</v>

352
00:14:25.751 --> 00:14:27.010
<v Speaker 1>We don't have to give humans now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pull.</v>

353
00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:28.510
<v Speaker 1>Pull that up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is it right here.</v>

354
00:14:28.511 --> 00:14:32.500
<v Speaker 1>How a leopard seal fed me penguins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really crazy.</v>

355
00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:37.860
<v Speaker 1>They have video footage of it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if you press the video you'll </v>

356
00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:37.860
<v Speaker 1>see this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

357
00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:38.770
<v Speaker 1>it's really crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

358
00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:42.280
<v Speaker 1>this gigantic thing very well for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>videos.</v>

359
00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:42.760
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

360
00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:44.290
<v Speaker 1>No worries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't have to show it,</v>

361
00:14:44.291 --> 00:14:47.200
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>folks can find it online.</v>

362
00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:49.720
<v Speaker 1>How a leopard seal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that the name of it?</v>

363
00:14:49.721 --> 00:14:52.030
<v Speaker 1>How a leopard seal fed me penguins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>

364
00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:53.990
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's national geographic as well.</v>

365
00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:55.250
<v Speaker 2>That's your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your folks.</v>

366
00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:57.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I recognize the over correction.</v>

367
00:14:57.950 --> 00:15:00.620
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of had a similar experience quite</v>

368
00:15:00.621 --> 00:15:02.480
<v Speaker 2>a few years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Chew Gum.</v>

369
00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:05.270
<v Speaker 2>You ever heard of a Jugo?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard the word,</v>

370
00:15:05.271 --> 00:15:07.190
<v Speaker 2>but what is it during the Iranian </v>
<v Speaker 2>family?</v>

371
00:15:07.191 --> 00:15:10.490
<v Speaker 2>Closest relative is manatee Chigong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of,</v>

372
00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:11.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what a manatee is.</v>

373
00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:15.110
<v Speaker 2>So think of a manatee and then instead </v>
<v Speaker 2>of like a beaver tail,</v>

374
00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:19.310
<v Speaker 2>put a dolphin tail on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very small differences,</v>

375
00:15:19.311 --> 00:15:23.780
<v Speaker 2>but basically the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there was this one in Vanuatu and it</v>

376
00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:25.960
<v Speaker 2>lost its partner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

377
00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:29.480
<v Speaker 2>and so every day what I do is catch </v>
<v Speaker 2>turtles and bring it up to the beach and</v>

378
00:15:29.481 --> 00:15:31.370
<v Speaker 2>just push them up on the beach for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>locals to eat.</v>

379
00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:34.430
<v Speaker 2>And so every day he would catch all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>food the locals would need.</v>

380
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:39.550
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they befriended it and it was </v>

381
00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:39.620
<v Speaker 2>one of the juveniles in the world that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you could actually swim and play with.</v>

382
00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:42.260
<v Speaker 2>We did a documentary on it called the </v>
<v Speaker 2>elusive mermaid.</v>

383
00:15:42.261 --> 00:15:45.730
<v Speaker 2>So I spent a quite a few weeks with this</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy credit.</v>

384
00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:48.740
<v Speaker 2>So strains like the personality </v>
<v Speaker 2>diversity in these animals,</v>

385
00:15:48.741 --> 00:15:49.580
<v Speaker 2>like glue that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There it is.</v>

386
00:15:49.581 --> 00:15:51.410
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That thing is crazy looking.</v>

387
00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:54.650
<v Speaker 2>Huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chabad 900 kilograms.</v>

388
00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:59.710
<v Speaker 2>It's D U,</v>
<v Speaker 2>g o n g for anybody who's interested do </v>

389
00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:04.181
<v Speaker 2>gone to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gone to gung what a crazy looking </v>

390
00:16:04.181 --> 00:16:04.181
<v Speaker 2>animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are there.</v>

391
00:16:04.181 --> 00:16:08.380
<v Speaker 2>They're sometimes called the sea cow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They eat about 40 kilograms of seagrass </v>

392
00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:09.170
<v Speaker 2>a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So wireless amount of food.</v>

393
00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:14.950
<v Speaker 2>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes called the elusive mermaid as </v>

394
00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:17.501
<v Speaker 2>well because at sale is back in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Used to mistake them for four nights.</v>

395
00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:19.830
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

396
00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:22.750
<v Speaker 2>well you to be drinking a lot around </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

397
00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:27.710
<v Speaker 2>that some people just get so desperado </v>
<v Speaker 2>after long periods of time alone.</v>

398
00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:30.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a wild wild animal though.</v>

399
00:16:30.561 --> 00:16:35.561
<v Speaker 2>It's strange that it would try to feed </v>
<v Speaker 2>people and they have no idea what the </v>

400
00:16:35.561 --> 00:16:35.561
<v Speaker 2>motivation is.</v>

401
00:16:35.561 --> 00:16:35.690
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

402
00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:40.900
<v Speaker 2>once again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you anthropomorphize it just </v>

403
00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:41.720
<v Speaker 2>wanted interaction and one of their very</v>
<v Speaker 2>close knit social structure.</v>

404
00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:44.090
<v Speaker 2>So when you have a group of them </v>
<v Speaker 2>together,</v>

405
00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:45.980
<v Speaker 2>they're all together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're very tactile,</v>

406
00:16:45.981 --> 00:16:49.310
<v Speaker 2>rubbing up against each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if it was in the middle of nowhere,</v>

407
00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:54.420
<v Speaker 2>there's no more geographies around it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just decided to befriend the locals and </v>

408
00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:58.271
<v Speaker 2>kind of go that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's lots of evidence with lots </v>

409
00:16:58.271 --> 00:16:58.880
<v Speaker 2>of animals doing that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>friendships going on.</v>

410
00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:01.440
<v Speaker 2>And I've got a good story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

411
00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:06.510
<v Speaker 2>if you give me a second for the juggle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I nearly got killed budget go </v>

412
00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:08.660
<v Speaker 2>accidentally or tried to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tried to kill me.</v>

413
00:17:09.610 --> 00:17:14.610
<v Speaker 2>So I was filming this documentary </v>
<v Speaker 2>elusive moment and so we've doing lots </v>

414
00:17:14.610 --> 00:17:19.331
<v Speaker 2>and lots of video and so I went to this </v>
<v Speaker 2>one in Vanuatu and we're filming him and</v>

415
00:17:20.101 --> 00:17:21.980
<v Speaker 2>in the water playing with him and stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

416
00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:26.300
<v Speaker 2>And he really liked females,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't lock humans,</v>

417
00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:29.360
<v Speaker 2>humans love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he would have some new data issues.</v>

418
00:17:29.361 --> 00:17:31.040
<v Speaker 2>He would chase and harassed miles </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically.</v>

419
00:17:31.041 --> 00:17:34.160
<v Speaker 2>But back in those days I had long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>long hair.</v>

420
00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:35.450
<v Speaker 2>Sounds like Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>

421
00:17:35.451 --> 00:17:35.750
<v Speaker 2>there's only.</v>

422
00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:44.670
<v Speaker 2>So I had long hair so I kind of fooled,</v>
<v Speaker 2>folded basically that he thought he was,</v>

423
00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:47.360
<v Speaker 2>it was all real casual with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he would,</v>

424
00:17:47.361 --> 00:17:52.361
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would grab your leg basically and he </v>

425
00:17:52.361 --> 00:17:54.270
<v Speaker 2>would on your wetsuit and clean his </v>
<v Speaker 2>mouth on it and stuff like that.</v>

426
00:17:54.271 --> 00:17:59.271
<v Speaker 2>It's very tactile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely grabbing your tongue in his </v>

427
00:17:59.271 --> 00:17:59.271
<v Speaker 2>mouth on your leg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the bristles in front of his nose.</v>

428
00:17:59.271 --> 00:18:01.030
<v Speaker 2>He was just kind of cleaned that on your</v>
<v Speaker 2>wet suit and stuff.</v>

429
00:18:01.031 --> 00:18:04.190
<v Speaker 2>He was just very tactile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so one time he was doing that and he</v>

430
00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:07.260
<v Speaker 2>kind of went a little bit too far up my </v>
<v Speaker 2>leg and he felt something.</v>

431
00:18:07.261 --> 00:18:08.340
<v Speaker 2>He went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw him,</v>

432
00:18:08.341 --> 00:18:11.330
<v Speaker 2>he looked at me and you're not female,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're male,</v>

433
00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:14.310
<v Speaker 2>and so he attacked me and so what he did</v>
<v Speaker 2>is he,</v>

434
00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:19.290
<v Speaker 2>he grabbed me and then it's 900 kilogram</v>
<v Speaker 2>animal or you got no hope,</v>

435
00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:21.630
<v Speaker 2>so he grabbed me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>holding my arms against my chest,</v>

436
00:18:21.631 --> 00:18:21.990
<v Speaker 2>sort of thing.</v>

437
00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:27.020
<v Speaker 2>Took me down to about five meters on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>sandy bottom and just held me against </v>

438
00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:27.330
<v Speaker 2>the sandy bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to kill you.</v>

439
00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:32.510
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm kicking and thrashing and I'm </v>

440
00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:32.510
<v Speaker 2>punching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing everything I can to get out of</v>

441
00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:35.620
<v Speaker 2>this bear hug from this Chigong and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

442
00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:36.960
<v Speaker 2>I was down there for a minute and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>half,</v>

443
00:18:36.961 --> 00:18:40.060
<v Speaker 2>two minutes and I'm excited to get them </v>
<v Speaker 2>black coming in on the vision.</v>

444
00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:45.530
<v Speaker 2>And I remember clear as day just </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking death by Jugo didn't see that </v>

445
00:18:45.631 --> 00:18:48.810
<v Speaker 2>one coming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then as soon as I gave up,</v>

446
00:18:48.811 --> 00:18:50.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just kind of stopped fighting.</v>

447
00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:52.020
<v Speaker 2>He just let me go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just a game.</v>

448
00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:57.170
<v Speaker 2>It's just a game for him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just wanted to prove dominance </v>

449
00:18:57.170 --> 00:18:57.170
<v Speaker 2>basically.</v>

450
00:18:57.170 --> 00:18:59.860
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And obviously he doesn't have any data </v>

451
00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:01.290
<v Speaker 3>as far as how many minutes a person can </v>
<v Speaker 3>hold</v>

452
00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:05.680
<v Speaker 2>breath for they die as soon as I stopped</v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting and I just gave into,</v>

453
00:19:05.681 --> 00:19:09.750
<v Speaker 2>to the fact of death by Juggle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he let me go and I was wearing a wetsuit</v>

454
00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:11.910
<v Speaker 2>so it's kind of brought me back to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>surface.</v>

455
00:19:11.911 --> 00:19:15.150
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was a near death experience for me.</v>

456
00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:16.800
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

457
00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:19.560
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How terrifying and weird.</v>

458
00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:22.780
<v Speaker 2>So he felt like you tricked him?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

459
00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:24.690
<v Speaker 2>well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told him.</v>

460
00:19:24.691 --> 00:19:26.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was there and uh,</v>

461
00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:28.440
<v Speaker 2>there was a honeymoon couple there as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

462
00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:33.500
<v Speaker 2>It was a little resort where we call it </v>
<v Speaker 2>resort and like shacks in the forest </v>

463
00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:36.501
<v Speaker 2>kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I remember sitting there at dinner </v>

464
00:19:36.501 --> 00:19:37.680
<v Speaker 2>one time and now the new wife is going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

465
00:19:37.681 --> 00:19:42.681
<v Speaker 2>come on honey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jumped in the water with the Jew going </v>

466
00:19:42.681 --> 00:19:42.681
<v Speaker 2>to barneys please.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like no way.</v>

467
00:19:42.681 --> 00:19:42.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm not hopping in because he would just</v>
<v Speaker 2>get attacked every time.</v>

468
00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:45.000
<v Speaker 2>So he really didn't like males.</v>

469
00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:51.550
<v Speaker 3>That's so strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder what it is about you just long </v>

470
00:19:51.550 --> 00:19:51.550
<v Speaker 3>hair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how could they,</v>

471
00:19:51.550 --> 00:19:53.660
<v Speaker 3>how could they know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The cultural differences between the way</v>

472
00:19:53.661 --> 00:19:54.800
<v Speaker 3>humans were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their hair.</v>

473
00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:58.520
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you could speculate and just go,</v>

474
00:19:58.521 --> 00:19:59.810
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just recognizing,</v>

475
00:19:59.811 --> 00:20:04.811
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's all hippie long hair people and </v>

476
00:20:04.811 --> 00:20:06.941
<v Speaker 2>non long hair people at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how the fuck would he know </v>

477
00:20:06.941 --> 00:20:08.480
<v Speaker 2>animals or we need more data.</v>

478
00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:10.770
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that's what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or the thing is you,</v>

479
00:20:10.771 --> 00:20:14.550
<v Speaker 3>with your long experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lifelong experience being around animals</v>

480
00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:18.360
<v Speaker 3>that maybe you were more relaxed so he </v>
<v Speaker 3>was cool with you.</v>

481
00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:20.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's definitely an aspect.</v>

482
00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:24.380
<v Speaker 3>Maybe Mandolin and they give off that </v>
<v Speaker 3>energy of gone.</v>

483
00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:25.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

484
00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:27.240
<v Speaker 3>I mean that definitely could be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

485
00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:31.290
<v Speaker 3>you back off bitch and then he attacks </v>
<v Speaker 3>him and the girls like don't hurt me.</v>

486
00:20:31.291 --> 00:20:32.310
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm good.</v>

487
00:20:32.650 --> 00:20:35.370
<v Speaker 3>We're good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe just like people to be submissive.</v>

488
00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:37.560
<v Speaker 3>Quite pop that right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

489
00:20:37.561 --> 00:20:38.180
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

490
00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:40.770
<v Speaker 3>the whole Alpha thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going on everywhere.</v>

491
00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:42.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a strange,</v>

492
00:20:42.061 --> 00:20:47.061
<v Speaker 3>strange looking animal man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would be a weird animal to kill </v>

493
00:20:47.061 --> 00:20:47.061
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

494
00:20:47.061 --> 00:20:48.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely didn't expect.</v>

495
00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:53.190
<v Speaker 2>I didn't expect to have a near death </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience with juggle because you can </v>

496
00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:56.251
<v Speaker 2>barely get near these creatures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Normally a fleeting glimpse in the in </v>

497
00:20:56.291 --> 00:20:58.990
<v Speaker 2>the far distances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All you ever see these animals,</v>

498
00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:04.070
<v Speaker 3>so is it when they're around resorts or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that where they become </v>

499
00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:05.670
<v Speaker 3>accustomed to humans or around where </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's large populations.</v>

500
00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:06.120
<v Speaker 3>Think</v>

501
00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:11.610
<v Speaker 2>I have another time juggle this one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He died or left or something went wrong </v>

502
00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:16.440
<v Speaker 2>a few years back and I can't recall any </v>
<v Speaker 2>other time geographies around the world </v>

503
00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:21.070
<v Speaker 2>except in captivity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I spent a bit of time with a tube in </v>

504
00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:24.880
<v Speaker 2>captivity at seaworld on the Gold Coast </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Australia and yeah,</v>

505
00:21:24.881 --> 00:21:27.430
<v Speaker 2>there were a bit messed up actually like</v>
<v Speaker 2>most animals in captivity.</v>

506
00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:29.900
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like that lion whisper cat.</v>

507
00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:34.930
<v Speaker 3>What's that dude's name?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The handsome fella that's always on </v>

508
00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:38.561
<v Speaker 3>television.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's on the Jimmy Kimmel show all the </v>

509
00:21:38.561 --> 00:21:38.561
<v Speaker 3>time and he's always hanging around with</v>
<v Speaker 3>lions.</v>

510
00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:43.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he sees the line is like Hulu would </v>

511
00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:44.030
<v Speaker 3>you do in the lion comes up to him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He gives him a hug.</v>

512
00:21:44.031 --> 00:21:44.500
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

513
00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:47.000
<v Speaker 3>how the fuck did you ever work that out?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

514
00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:48.950
<v Speaker 3>what color?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you work out that relationship?</v>

515
00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:51.500
<v Speaker 3>Is that the guy now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one of them.</v>

516
00:21:51.501 --> 00:21:55.790
<v Speaker 3>I think just probably more than one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>these dudes obviously looks very 90,</v>

517
00:21:55.791 --> 00:21:56.900
<v Speaker 3>nine times out of 100.</v>

518
00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:01.670
<v Speaker 3>That's the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well apparently this is what,</v>

519
00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:05.540
<v Speaker 3>from what I understand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like lions and big cats,</v>

520
00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:09.950
<v Speaker 3>tigers and lions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you have them as pets and you raise</v>

521
00:22:09.951 --> 00:22:12.500
<v Speaker 3>them as pets and you get used to them </v>
<v Speaker 3>accustomed to them,</v>

522
00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:16.340
<v Speaker 3>there's so not intimidated by you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As long as they're well fed,</v>

523
00:22:16.550 --> 00:22:21.550
<v Speaker 3>you're pretty safe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're most likely not gonna fuck you </v>

524
00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:24.191
<v Speaker 3>up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they might fuck up other people who </v>

525
00:22:24.191 --> 00:22:24.640
<v Speaker 3>are around you and panic and don't know </v>
<v Speaker 3>how to deal and they're like,</v>

526
00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:29.660
<v Speaker 3>why don't you bring this asshole here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like hanging out with you and then </v>

527
00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:29.890
<v Speaker 3>they just whack them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

528
00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:31.970
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we give enough respectful </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals.</v>

529
00:22:31.971 --> 00:22:33.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean just you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your dog,</v>

530
00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:39.040
<v Speaker 2>your dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like some people and doesn't like other </v>

531
00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:39.040
<v Speaker 2>people and you should always listened to</v>
<v Speaker 2>your dope.</v>

532
00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:40.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>knows best will.</v>

533
00:22:40.301 --> 00:22:42.460
<v Speaker 3>You dog definitely knows when people are</v>
<v Speaker 3>shady.</v>

534
00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:45.140
<v Speaker 3>You know when you have someone over and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the dog started growling.</v>

535
00:22:45.170 --> 00:22:47.590
<v Speaker 3>Like what the fuck is going on man?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

536
00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:49.840
<v Speaker 3>tap dogs know when people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>comfortable,</v>

537
00:22:49.841 --> 00:22:51.640
<v Speaker 3>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

538
00:22:51.641 --> 00:22:52.600
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew this lady,</v>

539
00:22:52.601 --> 00:22:54.400
<v Speaker 3>she had these crazy German shepherds </v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

540
00:22:54.401 --> 00:22:59.401
<v Speaker 3>but I've been around dogs my whole life </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was cool with them and she was </v>

541
00:22:59.401 --> 00:23:00.040
<v Speaker 3>surprised and she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

542
00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:02.290
<v Speaker 3>normally when these dogs around people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that ground,</v>

543
00:23:02.291 --> 00:23:03.370
<v Speaker 3>they want to bite them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

544
00:23:03.371 --> 00:23:05.650
<v Speaker 3>why don't you fucking do something about</v>
<v Speaker 3>your dogs then?</v>

545
00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:11.010
<v Speaker 3>Like everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like your dog thinks everybody's an </v>

546
00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:11.620
<v Speaker 3>asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that's probably on you.</v>

547
00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:13.700
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's bad training or</v>

548
00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:18.720
<v Speaker 2>using positive reinforcement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you use that technique you can get up</v>

549
00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:21.530
<v Speaker 2>to do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any animal and will anyone.</v>

550
00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:26.590
<v Speaker 3>I think she liked having aggressive dogs</v>
<v Speaker 3>and she liked having people intimidated </v>

551
00:23:26.751 --> 00:23:28.260
<v Speaker 3>around her and her dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

552
00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:30.430
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's neither here nor there.</v>

553
00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:33.500
<v Speaker 3>You've been bitten by a box jellyfish?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

554
00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:35.000
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been stung.</v>

555
00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:40.070
<v Speaker 3>Technical bitten their face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've been looked at and read.</v>

556
00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:43.400
<v Speaker 3>You've been read the riot act now they </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have my mouth.</v>

557
00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:45.850
<v Speaker 3>And you get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How'd you stung or do you,</v>

558
00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:46.070
<v Speaker 3>did</v>

559
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:47.570
<v Speaker 2>you not know it was there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>

560
00:23:48.250 --> 00:23:53.250
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know what to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously I was about 12 years old in </v>

561
00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:57.970
<v Speaker 2>Torres Strait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a bunch of islands in between </v>

562
00:23:57.970 --> 00:24:00.311
<v Speaker 2>Australia and Papa New Guinea and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>playing with a holly Patar Strait </v>

563
00:24:00.311 --> 00:24:00.311
<v Speaker 2>islanders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a local boys.</v>

564
00:24:00.311 --> 00:24:02.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm playing in the ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

565
00:24:02.030 --> 00:24:05.480
<v Speaker 2>just swimming around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I had one wraparound.</v>

566
00:24:05.530 --> 00:24:06.970
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my leg quadricep.</v>

567
00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:09.140
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

568
00:24:09.141 --> 00:24:14.141
<v Speaker 2>a lot of pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard a women who've had children </v>

569
00:24:14.141 --> 00:24:19.010
<v Speaker 2>have said that I've said that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's far superior pain to childbirth </v>

570
00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:23.830
<v Speaker 2>that superior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they enjoy a better or a far worse </v>

571
00:24:23.871 --> 00:24:28.871
<v Speaker 2>basically in orders of magnitude worse </v>
<v Speaker 2>than childbirth is how they relate the </v>

572
00:24:28.871 --> 00:24:33.521
<v Speaker 2>pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd probably have to talk to someone </v>

573
00:24:33.521 --> 00:24:35.321
<v Speaker 2>who's been stung by a bullet ant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is supposed to be one of the most </v>

574
00:24:35.321 --> 00:24:37.400
<v Speaker 2>painful things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't wonder who's got the.</v>

575
00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:40.400
<v Speaker 2>She's got the know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you get someone to listen.</v>

576
00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:44.270
<v Speaker 2>I know you've been stung by a bullet in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to encourage you to try the box</v>

577
00:24:44.271 --> 00:24:48.440
<v Speaker 2>jellyfish and tell me it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

578
00:24:48.441 --> 00:24:53.441
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot of pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a kind of pain where you have to </v>

579
00:24:53.441 --> 00:24:53.441
<v Speaker 2>scream expletives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

580
00:24:53.441 --> 00:24:57.060
<v Speaker 2>you can't just sit there and take it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to be screaming something </v>

581
00:24:57.060 --> 00:25:01.000
<v Speaker 2>because it's that painful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's super deadly to the very old and </v>

582
00:25:02.691 --> 00:25:03.930
<v Speaker 2>the very young.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

583
00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:04.870
<v Speaker 2>it depends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Done.</v>

584
00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:06.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

585
00:25:06.810 --> 00:25:09.330
<v Speaker 2>that's actually pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're talking very young five,</v>

586
00:25:09.331 --> 00:25:14.331
<v Speaker 2>six.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about the amount of toxin </v>

587
00:25:14.331 --> 00:25:14.331
<v Speaker 2>to body mass basis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're,</v>

588
00:25:14.331 --> 00:25:18.970
<v Speaker 2>if you're a little tiny kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then that's a lot of toxin for a small </v>

589
00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:18.970
<v Speaker 2>body nets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're very old,</v>

590
00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:20.510
<v Speaker 2>then it's heart attacks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aneurysms,</v>

591
00:25:20.511 --> 00:25:21.830
<v Speaker 2>that sort of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

592
00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:24.980
<v Speaker 2>Aneurysms fucking well just it messes </v>
<v Speaker 2>you up.</v>

593
00:25:24.981 --> 00:25:29.981
<v Speaker 2>The pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It causes heart attacks or just freak </v>

594
00:25:29.981 --> 00:25:29.981
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

595
00:25:29.981 --> 00:25:29.981
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Too much pain.</v>

596
00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:35.110
<v Speaker 2>So just the physical sensation of pain </v>
<v Speaker 2>is the catalyst for these heart attacks </v>

597
00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:35.240
<v Speaker 2>and all these different things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you just,</v>

598
00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:36.430
<v Speaker 2>your body freaks out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

599
00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:37.820
<v Speaker 2>you aren't getting stung by a </v>
<v Speaker 2>neurotoxin.</v>

600
00:25:37.821 --> 00:25:40.430
<v Speaker 2>Don't get me wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a little in the tentacles of the</v>

601
00:25:40.431 --> 00:25:41.870
<v Speaker 2>box jellyfish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's new mattresses,</v>

602
00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:44.190
<v Speaker 2>a little tiny poisons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dots basically,</v>

603
00:25:44.191 --> 00:25:46.400
<v Speaker 2>and when it touches something </v>
<v Speaker 2>biological,</v>

604
00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:51.760
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's why you can wear tiny little </v>

605
00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:51.760
<v Speaker 2>thin lycra suit or pantyhose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

606
00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:56.711
<v Speaker 2>as long as there's something in between </v>
<v Speaker 2>your skin and the box jellyfish will </v>

607
00:25:56.711 --> 00:25:58.040
<v Speaker 2>never stink.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if it touches something biological,</v>

608
00:25:58.070 --> 00:26:03.070
<v Speaker 2>then these little poisonous darts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fire and they fire into your skin and </v>

609
00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:05.930
<v Speaker 2>they inject a neurotoxin and it makes </v>
<v Speaker 2>for an incredible amount of pain.</v>

610
00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:07.500
<v Speaker 2>Incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

611
00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:12.970
<v Speaker 2>the first day back then was vinegar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had a bottle of vinegar I remember </v>

612
00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:13.490
<v Speaker 2>clear as day.</v>

613
00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:16.340
<v Speaker 2>My Dad came over and he got the bottle </v>
<v Speaker 2>of vinegar,</v>

614
00:26:16.341 --> 00:26:21.341
<v Speaker 2>two liter bottle of vinegar and you just</v>
<v Speaker 2>put one little splash on there and then </v>

615
00:26:21.341 --> 00:26:22.190
<v Speaker 2>put the lid back up and I'm sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>screaming and I'm like,</v>

616
00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:23.340
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Raul bottle on there?</v>

617
00:26:23.341 --> 00:26:28.341
<v Speaker 2>But he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wanted to save some in case some of </v>

618
00:26:28.341 --> 00:26:28.341
<v Speaker 2>the local got stung as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you could.</v>

619
00:26:28.341 --> 00:26:31.900
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's saving them for some folks he </v>

620
00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:33.160
<v Speaker 2>doesn't even know I got one splash dad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

621
00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:38.200
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was screaming some explainers Adam </v>

622
00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:38.200
<v Speaker 2>over that one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how long does the pain last?</v>

623
00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:42.270
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was about six hours before I just </v>

624
00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:44.040
<v Speaker 2>passed out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was six hours of pain sitting there</v>

625
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:44.910
<v Speaker 1>screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>expletives,</v>

626
00:26:44.911 --> 00:26:46.860
<v Speaker 1>and then I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I just talked myself out,</v>

627
00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:48.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I passed out.</v>

628
00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:50.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm still painful for probably about six</v>
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>

629
00:26:50.881 --> 00:26:54.960
<v Speaker 1>Five months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Six months.</v>

630
00:26:55.130 --> 00:26:57.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It lasts for a long time.</v>

631
00:26:57.361 --> 00:27:00.270
<v Speaker 1>Not as severe as that first six hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's still.</v>

632
00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:03.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's six months.</v>

633
00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:06.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't recommend it now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

634
00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:09.870
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that the worst thing to happen,</v>

635
00:27:09.871 --> 00:27:11.610
<v Speaker 1>like with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from an animal other than death?</v>

636
00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:15.630
<v Speaker 1>Like as far as like pain that my being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard anything that lasts six</v>

637
00:27:15.631 --> 00:27:20.631
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure getting mauled by a lion would </v>

638
00:27:20.631 --> 00:27:20.631
<v Speaker 1>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

639
00:27:20.631 --> 00:27:21.720
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be death,</v>

640
00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:27.110
<v Speaker 1>but you're talking about like damage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that's ripping your tissue apart </v>

641
00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:27.290
<v Speaker 1>and breaking bones and things along </v>
<v Speaker 1>those lines.</v>

642
00:27:27.291 --> 00:27:28.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

643
00:27:28.411 --> 00:27:33.411
<v Speaker 1>what you're having is just this little </v>
<v Speaker 1>tiny needles and it affects you for six </v>

644
00:27:33.411 --> 00:27:35.320
<v Speaker 1>months and that's not the worst </v>
<v Speaker 1>jellyfish.</v>

645
00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:36.090
<v Speaker 1>Everyone goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>box,</v>

646
00:27:36.091 --> 00:27:37.270
<v Speaker 1>jellyfish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>current next flicker.</v>

647
00:27:37.271 --> 00:27:38.010
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were all like,</v>

648
00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:39.030
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the worst one.</v>

649
00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:41.640
<v Speaker 1>Will actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what's the worst one,</v>

650
00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:43.530
<v Speaker 1>Cold Era Kanji.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

651
00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:49.010
<v Speaker 1>it's actually a whole heap of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they lumped them all together into </v>

652
00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:49.010
<v Speaker 1>this era.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kanji,</v>

653
00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:53.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm sort of group and they're tiny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're the size of your pinky </v>

654
00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:53.230
<v Speaker 1>fingernail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely tiny.</v>

655
00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:58.190
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the pain from them is more severe </v>

656
00:27:58.190 --> 00:27:58.190
<v Speaker 1>than a box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jelly fish.</v>

657
00:27:58.190 --> 00:27:58.190
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crushed.</v>

658
00:27:58.190 --> 00:27:58.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

659
00:27:58.711 --> 00:28:01.710
<v Speaker 1>and you don't even feel the steam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't we find them and kill them all</v>

660
00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:03.560
<v Speaker 1>my love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's,</v>

661
00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:06.390
<v Speaker 1>what's wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is everybody not enough research?</v>

662
00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:09.540
<v Speaker 1>Not enough research on them yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We still don't know a lot about them.</v>

663
00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:14.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Russians are going to use him for </v>

664
00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:14.660
<v Speaker 1>toxic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're gonna.</v>

665
00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:14.660
<v Speaker 1>Drop my Manhattan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A big balloon.</v>

666
00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:19.310
<v Speaker 1>Blame the Russians don't need names.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some evil people that you don't know.</v>

667
00:28:20.101 --> 00:28:20.910
<v Speaker 1>I just love everyone.</v>

668
00:28:20.910 --> 00:28:22.120
<v Speaker 1>Always blames the Russians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

669
00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:23.400
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's convenient.</v>

670
00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:28.530
<v Speaker 1>You've been accustomed to it in TV and </v>
<v Speaker 1>movies for the last few decades said,</v>

671
00:28:28.550 --> 00:28:29.880
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we were kids,</v>

672
00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:33.120
<v Speaker 1>the real thing was when I was a kid and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in high school,</v>

673
00:28:33.121 --> 00:28:38.121
<v Speaker 1>it was always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're worried about the Russians nuking </v>

674
00:28:38.121 --> 00:28:38.121
<v Speaker 1>us more worried about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

675
00:28:38.121 --> 00:28:39.750
<v Speaker 1>we'd heard about the Cuban missile </v>
<v Speaker 1>crisis,</v>

676
00:28:39.751 --> 00:28:44.751
<v Speaker 1>the standoff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and everybody's always terrified that </v>

677
00:28:44.751 --> 00:28:44.751
<v Speaker 1>one day there was always the stories </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

678
00:28:44.751 --> 00:28:48.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was one time where we almost went </v>

679
00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:51.471
<v Speaker 1>to war with Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was almost a mistake and they </v>

680
00:28:51.471 --> 00:28:51.480
<v Speaker 1>thought missiles were in the air and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they almost sent missiles,</v>

681
00:28:51.481 --> 00:28:53.310
<v Speaker 1>have their own mutual assured </v>
<v Speaker 1>destruction.</v>

682
00:28:53.311 --> 00:28:54.720
<v Speaker 1>That actually happened quite a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>times,</v>

683
00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:59.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that was a gigantic fear in America.</v>

684
00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:04.990
<v Speaker 1>But you guys movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bad guy was always rest assure will </v>

685
00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:04.990
<v Speaker 1>be eastern European of some description.</v>

686
00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:09.660
<v Speaker 1>It's ironic really because I mean it </v>
<v Speaker 1>went away for a little while.</v>

687
00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:15.380
<v Speaker 1>Now it's back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not really ironic but interesting that </v>

688
00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:18.740
<v Speaker 1>now back with with Putin is the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>potent example of like the scary Russian</v>

689
00:29:20.371 --> 00:29:22.680
<v Speaker 1>guy ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kgb Judo,</v>

690
00:29:22.681 --> 00:29:27.681
<v Speaker 1>black belt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely dominating this country and </v>

691
00:29:27.681 --> 00:29:30.891
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a strange way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anytime there's some sort of political </v>

692
00:29:30.891 --> 00:29:34.071
<v Speaker 1>adversary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they magically wind up getting shot and </v>

693
00:29:34.071 --> 00:29:34.071
<v Speaker 1>public.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody goes to jail for it.</v>

694
00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:40.330
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of corruption all around </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world and I find it funny that we </v>

695
00:29:40.330 --> 00:29:43.641
<v Speaker 1>always pick that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I'm more aligned with probably </v>

696
00:29:43.641 --> 00:29:43.641
<v Speaker 1>Abby Martin</v>

697
00:29:43.641 --> 00:29:44.060
<v Speaker 2>on this one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love your interviews with.</v>

698
00:29:44.061 --> 00:29:46.540
<v Speaker 2>That'd be mountain by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That.</v>

699

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do some bad shit,</v>

700
00:29:48.131 --> 00:29:50.080
<v Speaker 2>but they also do some good stuff as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

701

<v Speaker 2>So he's openly gangster though in a </v>

703
00:29:56.370 --> 00:29:56.630
<v Speaker 2>weird way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like in good.</v>

704
00:29:56.710 --> 00:30:01.030
<v Speaker 2>In good ways and also in bad ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's pretty openly gangster.</v>

705
00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:02.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever watched him?</v>

706
00:30:02.591 --> 00:30:06.730
<v Speaker 2>He does the sort of public question and </v>
<v Speaker 2>answer sessions for about two hours once</v>

707
00:30:06.731 --> 00:30:07.720
<v Speaker 2>a year or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

708
00:30:07.721 --> 00:30:12.721
<v Speaker 2>does he have a watch?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really interesting to watch them </v>

709
00:30:12.721 --> 00:30:13.270
<v Speaker 2>actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a very smart,</v>

<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very smart man and even I've even seen </v>

711
00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:18.900
<v Speaker 2>humor in it as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very,</v>

712
00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:19.810
<v Speaker 2>very briefly.</v>

713
00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:22.160
<v Speaker 2>he likes trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

714
00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:24.820
<v Speaker 2>Really thinks trump would be a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>president.</v>

715
00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:27.040
<v Speaker 2>You Shit me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>

716
00:30:27.970 --> 00:30:28.450
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's.</v>

717
00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:33.480
<v Speaker 1>That's his guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Older respect to head from Putin is now </v>

718
00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:33.480
<v Speaker 1>discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might've made that up.</v>

719
00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:34.150
<v Speaker 1>Check it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>check it,</v>

720
00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:39.170
<v Speaker 1>check.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even trust me when I look at </v>

721
00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:41.170
<v Speaker 1>putting ice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wants to build it.</v>

722
00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:42.370
<v Speaker 1>That's what he wants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wants stability,</v>

723
00:30:42.371 --> 00:30:44.860
<v Speaker 1>stability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and trump is not cash.</v>

724
00:30:45.130 --> 00:30:48.980
<v Speaker 1>You don't think they're that trump and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Putin is over.</v>

725
00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:50.770
<v Speaker 1>It's over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>

726
00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:53.230
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

727
00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:55.800
<v Speaker 1>but he said he liked him for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just came out yesterday.</v>

728
00:30:55.910 --> 00:30:56.890
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is yesterday.</v>

729
00:30:56.891 --> 00:30:59.710
<v Speaker 1>So I was right for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There'd been boys until recently.</v>

730
00:31:00.610 --> 00:31:03.190
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what it is because Donald trump</v>

731
00:31:03.191 --> 00:31:08.191
<v Speaker 1>put out this ridiculous video about our </v>
<v Speaker 1>toughest opponents and he showed Putin </v>

732
00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:11.410
<v Speaker 1>to like doing judo throws and then he </v>
<v Speaker 1>showed you.</v>

733
00:31:11.411 --> 00:31:13.240
<v Speaker 1>Just see that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a hilarious video.</v>

734
00:31:13.510 --> 00:31:17.380
<v Speaker 1>Play it because it's so stupid and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>shows Hillary barking like a dog.</v>

735
00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:21.190
<v Speaker 1>It's really like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can say it's defamation,</v>

736
00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:26.340
<v Speaker 1>like he's doing this judo throw and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>shows isis and then he throws the </v>

737
00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:28.360
<v Speaker 1>Democrats have the perfect answer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't see that.</v>

738
00:31:28.361 --> 00:31:30.370
<v Speaker 1>But she's there making bark noises,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bark,</v>

739
00:31:30.371 --> 00:31:30.850
<v Speaker 1>bark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bark,</v>

740
00:31:30.851 --> 00:31:31.450
<v Speaker 1>bark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bark,</v>

741
00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:32.290
<v Speaker 1>bark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bark,</v>

742
00:31:32.291 --> 00:31:32.800
<v Speaker 1>bark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bark,</v>

743
00:31:32.801 --> 00:31:35.260
<v Speaker 1>bark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make America great again.</v>

744
00:31:36.250 --> 00:31:37.810
<v Speaker 1>See it here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll hear the music.</v>

745
00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:40.900
<v Speaker 1>She Isis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the Democrats have the perfect.</v>

746
00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:48.940
<v Speaker 1>How rude can you just do that at a keys?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Put fucking bark noises in her.</v>

747
00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:51.540
<v Speaker 1>Did she actually make those noises?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Making it?</v>

748
00:31:51.541 --> 00:31:52.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

749
00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:57.340
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess you can put a little remix of </v>

750
00:31:57.340 --> 00:31:59.041
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think when you're running for </v>

751
00:31:59.041 --> 00:31:59.041
<v Speaker 1>president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything's fair game.</v>

752
00:31:59.041 --> 00:31:59.800
<v Speaker 1>But I saw a video that I've reaped </v>
<v Speaker 1>tweeted today.</v>

753
00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:04.870
<v Speaker 1>It's called 13 minutes of Hillary </v>
<v Speaker 1>Clinton lying that someone posted.</v>

754
00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:09.510
<v Speaker 1>It's all her saying one thing and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying a completely different thing that</v>

755
00:32:09.530 --> 00:32:14.440
<v Speaker 1>she's always stood for a completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>different thing she gets while they just</v>

756
00:32:14.441 --> 00:32:15.230
<v Speaker 1>wanted to make it so</v>

757
00:32:15.550 --> 00:32:16.720
<v Speaker 2>you could absorb it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

758
00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:21.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you could get deep as an </v>
<v Speaker 2>Australian American politics is </v>

759
00:32:21.930 --> 00:32:23.740
<v Speaker 2>hilarious and also really sad.</v>

760
00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:28.090
<v Speaker 1>That's how we feel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys think you're having an election</v>

761
00:32:28.091 --> 00:32:29.140
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of the world.</v>

762
00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:30.110
<v Speaker 1>We're viewing this as</v>

763
00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:33.740
<v Speaker 2>cutest and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not doing so well.</v>

764
00:32:34.670 --> 00:32:35.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

765
00:32:36.350 --> 00:32:41.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's an asshole job and I think </v>

766
00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:41.780
<v Speaker 1>only assholes want that job at this </v>
<v Speaker 1>point in time.</v>

767
00:32:41.781 --> 00:32:43.710
<v Speaker 1>I think at one point in time do we.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that the real.</v>

768
00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:44.450
<v Speaker 1>You're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

769
00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:48.650
<v Speaker 1>But it became that with special interest</v>
<v Speaker 1>groups,</v>

770
00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:53.000
<v Speaker 1>with a corporate donations being </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely unrestricted.</v>

771
00:32:53.001 --> 00:32:58.001
<v Speaker 1>Now corporations can kind of act as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual and they have the freedom to </v>

772
00:32:58.001 --> 00:33:01.841
<v Speaker 1>act is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's become a money grab and </v>

773
00:33:01.841 --> 00:33:06.430
<v Speaker 1>we're a real strange one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what interests me is these guys like </v>

774
00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:08.360
<v Speaker 1>Bernie Sanders and Donald trump for two </v>
<v Speaker 1>different reasons.</v>

775
00:33:08.361 --> 00:33:13.361
<v Speaker 1>Bernie Sanders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he's a socialist and he doesn't </v>

776
00:33:13.361 --> 00:33:14.690
<v Speaker 1>want any buns money and he wants to take</v>
<v Speaker 1>down corporations and he wants everybody</v>

777
00:33:14.691 --> 00:33:19.691
<v Speaker 1>to pay more money to their workers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he wants free healthcare and free </v>

778
00:33:19.691 --> 00:33:20.880
<v Speaker 1>education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's an extreme lefty.</v>

779
00:33:20.881 --> 00:33:22.040
<v Speaker 1>You No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well hang on,</v>

780
00:33:22.041 --> 00:33:22.700
<v Speaker 1>I've got to stop here.</v>

781
00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:27.700
<v Speaker 1>I pay the rest of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bernie sanders would be slightly left.</v>

782
00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:32.950
<v Speaker 1>Hillary Clinton would be probably right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Donald trump would be out of the </v>

783
00:33:33.081 --> 00:33:34.880
<v Speaker 1>building on the righthand side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

784
00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:40.450
<v Speaker 1>Because when you look at Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia is not a great example at the </v>

785
00:33:40.450 --> 00:33:40.450
<v Speaker 1>moment because we kind of following you </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys.</v>

786
00:33:40.450 --> 00:33:44.471
<v Speaker 1>But when you look at Europe like yet </v>
<v Speaker 1>nearly all your candidates are right of </v>

787
00:33:44.471 --> 00:33:46.580
<v Speaker 1>Santa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though the Democrats or whatever.</v>

788
00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:52.440
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bernie Sanders I've heard a little bit </v>

789
00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:52.440
<v Speaker 1>about and some of the stuff I agree </v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

790
00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:53.170
<v Speaker 1>I must be too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

791
00:33:53.171 --> 00:33:58.171
<v Speaker 1>I do as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree with a lot of social stuff a </v>

792
00:33:58.171 --> 00:34:01.141
<v Speaker 1>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree with the minimum wage thing and </v>

793
00:34:01.141 --> 00:34:01.141
<v Speaker 1>that's the one thing that I need a real </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk to her.</v>

794
00:34:01.141 --> 00:34:02.480
<v Speaker 1>Like a real economist who's like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>centrist,</v>

795
00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:07.660
<v Speaker 1>someone who has a real objective </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective on it because a lot of </v>

796
00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:08.510
<v Speaker 1>people just trying to like protect money</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they don't want.</v>

797
00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:11.890
<v Speaker 1>They definitely don't want to pay more </v>
<v Speaker 1>to workers and don't want a minimum wage</v>

798
00:34:11.891 --> 00:34:14.870
<v Speaker 1>should be 15 bucks an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we call a living minimum wage.</v>

799
00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:20.290
<v Speaker 1>But what I agree with a lot of his stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as like people like just just </v>

800
00:34:22.850 --> 00:34:24.680
<v Speaker 1>social issues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

801
00:34:24.681 --> 00:34:29.681
<v Speaker 1>his issues when it comes to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>legalization of recreational drugs is </v>

802
00:34:29.681 --> 00:34:34.171
<v Speaker 1>issues when it comes to a lot of things </v>
<v Speaker 1>like education being far too expensive </v>

803
00:34:34.171 --> 00:34:39.011
<v Speaker 1>and students being saddled down with </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous amounts of debt before they </v>

804
00:34:39.011 --> 00:34:42.551
<v Speaker 1>get out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why can't we engineer a system where </v>

805
00:34:42.551 --> 00:34:45.140
<v Speaker 1>reasonable healthcare is taken care of </v>
<v Speaker 1>for people with normal,</v>

806
00:34:45.141 --> 00:34:50.141
<v Speaker 1>regular stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no reason why you can't go to </v>

807
00:34:50.141 --> 00:34:52.910
<v Speaker 1>the world is telling you it's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I have friends that live in Canada </v>

808
00:34:52.910 --> 00:34:54.590
<v Speaker 1>and their healthcare is atrocious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way they describe it,</v>

809
00:34:55.090 --> 00:34:59.180
<v Speaker 1>this is from me personally from them and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's more than one person.</v>

810
00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:03.530
<v Speaker 1>They've had issues with needing surgery </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they have to wait a year and hip the</v>

811
00:35:03.590 --> 00:35:08.590
<v Speaker 1>hip replacements and knee surgeries and </v>
<v Speaker 1>things along those lines where they're </v>

812
00:35:08.590 --> 00:35:10.820
<v Speaker 1>just limping around for like a year </v>
<v Speaker 1>waiting to get in Canada,</v>

813
00:35:10.821 --> 00:35:13.870
<v Speaker 1>but I can speak of Australia because we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have obviously very similar system.</v>

814
00:35:13.871 --> 00:35:18.170
<v Speaker 1>Australia's fucking fan tastic by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to wait out a whole.</v>

815
00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:22.250
<v Speaker 1>Like I go into see a doctor in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>morning and I can have a cat scan in the</v>

816
00:35:22.251 --> 00:35:24.740
<v Speaker 1>afternoon or what have you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to.</v>

817
00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:26.930
<v Speaker 1>If it's a knee reconstruction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

818
00:35:26.931 --> 00:35:28.460
<v Speaker 1>You get put on the list.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wait three months.</v>

819
00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:31.610
<v Speaker 1>Three months is not bad because you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might wait three months in America.</v>

820
00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:32.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's,</v>

821
00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:37.320
<v Speaker 1>it's not that bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if it's something a little </v>

822
00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:38.100
<v Speaker 1>definitely more urgent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're in surgery that afternoon.</v>

823
00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:40.860
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then also that's the public system.</v>

824
00:35:40.861 --> 00:35:44.160
<v Speaker 2>We don't have a private system as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I pay $600 a year,</v>

825
00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:48.810
<v Speaker 2>which most Americans find amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at $600 a year and that means I have</v>

826
00:35:48.811 --> 00:35:53.811
<v Speaker 2>a choice where I can go to the public or</v>
<v Speaker 2>the private hospital and so if I get </v>

827
00:35:53.811 --> 00:35:53.811
<v Speaker 2>told her you've got to wait three </v>
<v Speaker 2>months,</v>

828
00:35:53.811 --> 00:35:58.731
<v Speaker 2>I can go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I'll use the private health </v>

829
00:35:58.731 --> 00:35:58.731
<v Speaker 2>insurance in Iran on Tuesday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's incredible.</v>

830
00:35:59.050 --> 00:36:01.180
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a better system than apparently</v>

831
00:36:01.181 --> 00:36:04.360
<v Speaker 3>what's been described to me about Canada</v>
<v Speaker 3>and England as well,</v>

832
00:36:04.930 --> 00:36:09.930
<v Speaker 3>but I just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Australia is just so great as far as </v>

833
00:36:09.930 --> 00:36:10.570
<v Speaker 3>like the cities and the people like </v>
<v Speaker 3>Melbourne.</v>

834
00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:12.160
<v Speaker 3>I was in Melbourne and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

835
00:36:12.161 --> 00:36:14.850
<v Speaker 3>I don't even think I want to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I could live there.</v>

836
00:36:15.090 --> 00:36:16.930
<v Speaker 3>Like Melbourne is fantastic,</v>

837
00:36:17.110 --> 00:36:20.280
<v Speaker 2>but have the Australia though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not about the cities.</v>

838
00:36:20.430 --> 00:36:22.560
<v Speaker 2>It's about the outback.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about the Great Barrier Reef.</v>

839
00:36:22.561 --> 00:36:24.780
<v Speaker 2>It's about the remote places.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the.</v>

840
00:36:24.930 --> 00:36:25.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

841
00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:26.250
<v Speaker 3>that's for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>

842
00:36:26.290 --> 00:36:27.890
<v Speaker 3>you're all about the places where you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can die.</v>

843
00:36:28.430 --> 00:36:32.000
<v Speaker 3>Get killed by Tasmanian Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tigers and shit.</v>

844
00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:33.980
<v Speaker 3>Well they're not really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a dog,</v>

845
00:36:33.981 --> 00:36:34.540
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Task,</v>

846
00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:37.730
<v Speaker 3>testimonial,</v>
<v Speaker 3>togare Gypsy that moving,</v>

847
00:36:37.850 --> 00:36:38.840
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where um,</v>

848
00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:41.150
<v Speaker 3>what's his face?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Willem defoe goes and hunts.</v>

849
00:36:41.151 --> 00:36:44.140
<v Speaker 3>The last one finds a Tasmanian Tiger and</v>
<v Speaker 3>hunted.</v>

850
00:36:44.450 --> 00:36:46.500
<v Speaker 3>I missed that one stupid movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

851
00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:48.470
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seemed like a good idea.</v>

852
00:36:48.471 --> 00:36:50.120
<v Speaker 3>But then you watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really goofy.</v>

853
00:36:50.121 --> 00:36:52.310
<v Speaker 3>And then the Tasmanian tiger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously they're extinct.</v>

854
00:36:52.311 --> 00:36:54.730
<v Speaker 3>So it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a very like CGI,</v>

855
00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:55.990
<v Speaker 3>Tasmanian Tiger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

856
00:36:56.210 --> 00:37:00.260
<v Speaker 3>Like the remember the lions in a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am legend Gooey.</v>

857
00:37:00.270 --> 00:37:01.700
<v Speaker 3>It.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would be like what?</v>

858
00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:04.100
<v Speaker 3>That's how the Tasmanian Tiger looks </v>
<v Speaker 3>this?</v>

859
00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:04.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there it is.</v>

860
00:37:04.821 --> 00:37:05.360
<v Speaker 3>The hunter.</v>

861
00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:08.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For some reason he was hired.</v>

862
00:37:08.101 --> 00:37:13.101
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember the premise defoe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm kind of interested in yet at the </v>

863
00:37:13.101 --> 00:37:13.101
<v Speaker 2>same time.</v>

864
00:37:13.101 --> 00:37:13.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting.</v>

865
00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:14.840
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well the outback is.</v>

866
00:37:14.841 --> 00:37:19.841
<v Speaker 3>So the thing about Australia that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>fascinating to me is how few people </v>

867
00:37:19.841 --> 00:37:20.770
<v Speaker 3>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yet how enormous the,</v>

868
00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:21.700
<v Speaker 3>the actual country.</v>

869
00:37:22.210 --> 00:37:23.550
<v Speaker 2>It's huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the size of Europe.</v>

870
00:37:23.551 --> 00:37:27.150
<v Speaker 2>It's the size of a continental USA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's huge.</v>

871
00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:30.620
<v Speaker 2>And there's only a 20 something million </v>
<v Speaker 2>people in the entire country when he.</v>

872
00:37:30.690 --> 00:37:32.280
<v Speaker 2>What are we up to?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twenty four now.</v>

873
00:37:32.281 --> 00:37:33.900
<v Speaker 2>Somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's Los Angeles.</v>

874
00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:39.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've got some big deserts and stuff </v>

875
00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:41.520
<v Speaker 2>that we've got a lot of big space that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>not really that great.</v>

876
00:37:41.610 --> 00:37:43.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm not habitable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

877
00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:44.910
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

878
00:37:44.911 --> 00:37:49.911
<v Speaker 2>we got some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't have too many people and we've </v>

879
00:37:49.911 --> 00:37:53.061
<v Speaker 2>sold immigration not completely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we don't have any refugee problem or </v>

880
00:37:53.061 --> 00:37:53.200
<v Speaker 2>anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

881
00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:54.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we sold it.</v>

882
00:37:54.430 --> 00:37:58.380
<v Speaker 2>When we solved it solved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you solve it?</v>

883
00:37:58.680 --> 00:37:59.190
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

884
00:37:59.191 --> 00:38:02.420
<v Speaker 2>very simple to a trump like wall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

885
00:38:02.421 --> 00:38:04.920
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got an notion so we use that.</v>

886
00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:07.380
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so when people come across on boats,</v>

887
00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:09.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>refugee boats,</v>

888
00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:11.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jam packed full of people coming across.</v>

889
00:38:11.521 --> 00:38:16.521
<v Speaker 2>We meet them with a postcard and then we</v>
<v Speaker 2>turn them around and then if they don't </v>

890
00:38:16.591 --> 00:38:20.760
<v Speaker 2>turn around then we get all the people </v>
<v Speaker 2>on a coast guard,</v>

891
00:38:20.761 --> 00:38:23.280
<v Speaker 2>military boats and then we take them to </v>
<v Speaker 2>another country,</v>

892
00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:25.800
<v Speaker 2>to a detention camp and then we put them</v>
<v Speaker 2>in there.</v>

893
00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:31.140
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're a reporter or maybe you with </v>

894
00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:33.090
<v Speaker 2>Red Cross or something and you go visit </v>
<v Speaker 2>these dental detention camps,</v>

895
00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:34.780
<v Speaker 2>you can get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get put in jail for,</v>

896
00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:36.040
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ten years</v>

897
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:39.280
<v Speaker 1>or something for reporting on anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's going on there.</v>

898
00:38:39.281 --> 00:38:44.281
<v Speaker 1>So totally we've solved the problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can't report on it and yeah,</v>

899
00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:47.680
<v Speaker 1>that seems a little fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

900
00:38:48.010 --> 00:38:50.740
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know how you had George W Bush.</v>

901
00:38:50.741 --> 00:38:53.140
<v Speaker 1>We had our own little George W dot Bush </v>
<v Speaker 1>a few years ago.</v>

902
00:38:53.830 --> 00:38:55.720
<v Speaker 1>His name was Tony Abbott and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

903
00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:58.630
<v Speaker 1>he was messed up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He messed up.</v>

904
00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:00.350
<v Speaker 1>This is all his policies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

905
00:39:00.351 --> 00:39:02.330
<v Speaker 1>This is all his policy because he came </v>
<v Speaker 1>into power going,</v>

906
00:39:02.331 --> 00:39:03.400
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to stop the boats.</v>

907
00:39:03.401 --> 00:39:08.401
<v Speaker 1>And so that's how he did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just shipped him off to Papua New </v>

908
00:39:08.401 --> 00:39:12.480
<v Speaker 1>Guinea to other countries and then made </v>
<v Speaker 1>it a punishable by two years in jail to </v>

909
00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:14.560
<v Speaker 1>report anything about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

910
00:39:14.830 --> 00:39:16.750
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

911
00:39:16.910 --> 00:39:18.280
<v Speaker 1>But we solved the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

912
00:39:18.281 --> 00:39:23.281
<v Speaker 1>I guess you could say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that sounds like how trump would do </v>

913
00:39:23.281 --> 00:39:23.281
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

914
00:39:23.281 --> 00:39:23.740
<v Speaker 1>It's so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're saying that trump is right,</v>

915
00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:25.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way off the charts.</v>

916
00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:27.760
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like your old president.</v>

917
00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:33.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's what I hate about it other than </v>

918
00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:36.780
<v Speaker 1>it's just terrible for the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved is that we've lost our moral </v>

919
00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:37.450
<v Speaker 1>standing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can't turn around and go,</v>

920
00:39:37.690 --> 00:39:38.510
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

921
00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:39.430
<v Speaker 1>China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll,</v>

922
00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:42.130
<v Speaker 1>you'll doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the other four,</v>

923
00:39:42.590 --> 00:39:44.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've lost the word,</v>

924
00:39:44.441 --> 00:39:49.441
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't have that authority to have </v>

925
00:39:49.441 --> 00:39:52.330
<v Speaker 1>that high stance anymore because we </v>
<v Speaker 1>messed up stuff to people as well.</v>

926
00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:55.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And still going on to this day,</v>

927
00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:57.940
<v Speaker 1>no way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will not make Australia home.</v>

928
00:39:57.941 --> 00:39:59.950
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that was that campaign.</v>

929
00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:04.600
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I bet you let some nice white people</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm not like that.</v>

951
00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:55.510
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but anyway,</v>

952
00:40:55.560 --> 00:41:00.560
<v Speaker 1>Australia is awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it seems like a really good place </v>

953
00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:03.130
<v Speaker 1>though to have a base if you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>explore like if you're from that part of</v>

954
00:41:03.131 --> 00:41:04.570
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend,</v>

955

<v Speaker 1>but he um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adam Green tree and he's just constantly</v>

<v Speaker 1>weeks.</v>

962
00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:32.920
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most Australians have that setup.</v>

963
00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:34.010
<v Speaker 1>Most</v>

964
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:36.530
<v Speaker 2>Australians have some camping setup for </v>
<v Speaker 2>a month,</v>

965
00:41:36.590 --> 00:41:37.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of their truck.</v>

<v Speaker 2>stuff like they were super cool.</v>

967
00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:46.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you got some stretches in the </v>

968
00:41:46.750 --> 00:41:48.641
<v Speaker 2>outback there where you can literally go</v>
<v Speaker 2>for 500 kilometers without a fuel </v>

969
00:41:48.641 --> 00:41:49.220
<v Speaker 2>station,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you've got to take extra fuel.</v>

970
00:41:49.221 --> 00:41:50.390
<v Speaker 2>You've got to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to be prepared.</v>

972
00:41:55.540 --> 00:41:56.600
<v Speaker 2>strap up to the roof of the car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these gigantic jugs of gasoline,</v>

973
00:41:57.050 --> 00:42:01.070
<v Speaker 2>and you just illustrate the real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put that out enough like everyone goes</v>

974
00:42:01.071 --> 00:42:02.000
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd been to Australia,</v>

975
00:42:02.001 --> 00:42:02.960
<v Speaker 2>I've been to Sydney.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

977
00:42:05.010 --> 00:42:07.960

<v Speaker 2>Cannes,</v>

978
00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:12.990
<v Speaker 2>you know up the North East corner where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got rain forest and you've got a </v>

979
00:42:13.610 --> 00:42:16.670
<v Speaker 2>great barrier reef and you've got the </v>
<v Speaker 2>outback and that sort of stuff.</v>

980
00:42:17.650 --> 00:42:20.280
<v Speaker 2>The thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the oldest evidence of life ever</v>

981
00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:25.580
<v Speaker 2>is on earth in Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was an ancient ancient reef.</v>

982
00:42:25.581 --> 00:42:28.310
<v Speaker 2>There's Adams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sam Adams photos is one of them.</v>

983
00:42:29.090 --> 00:42:31.340
<v Speaker 2>We've got some amazing photos that he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>taken.</v>

984
00:42:33.130 --> 00:42:34.640
<v Speaker 2>Please go to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got a website,</v>

985
00:42:34.641 --> 00:42:36.820
<v Speaker 2>a really cool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

986
00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:39.770
<v Speaker 2>but my oldest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you talk in the human habitation,</v>

987
00:42:39.850 --> 00:42:42.110
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not human biological life.</v>

988
00:42:42.111 --> 00:42:47.111
<v Speaker 2>There's some sort of a enormous reef </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they found in Australia that was </v>

989
00:42:47.391 --> 00:42:49.710
<v Speaker 2>just fucking billions of years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

990
00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:52.430
<v Speaker 2>I do these two is where I first started </v>
<v Speaker 2>with linblad.</v>

991
00:42:52.431 --> 00:42:54.950
<v Speaker 2>National Geographic was in the Kimberley</v>
<v Speaker 2>region of Australia,</v>

992
00:42:54.951 --> 00:42:57.620
<v Speaker 2>which is the kind of northwest corner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>incredibly remote,</v>

993
00:42:57.670 --> 00:42:59.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>100 kilometers to the nearest road,</v>

994
00:42:59.721 --> 00:43:01.770
<v Speaker 2>wherever you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can only access it via these kind of</v>

995
00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:03.020
<v Speaker 2>ships.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one way you can get there.</v>

996
00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:06.500
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll be cruising through 100 meter,</v>

997
00:43:06.501 --> 00:43:07.400
<v Speaker 2>high,</v>
<v Speaker 2>300 foot.</v>

998
00:43:07.401 --> 00:43:12.401
<v Speaker 2>So I'm a sandstone canyons and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rocks,</v>

999
00:43:13.311 --> 00:43:15.110
<v Speaker 2>there are one point 8 billion years old.</v>

1000
00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:18.590
<v Speaker 2>They predate fossils and that's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kenyans that you're cruising through the</v>

1001
00:43:18.591 --> 00:43:23.591
<v Speaker 2>whole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It blows your mind to see that kind of </v>

1002
00:43:23.591 --> 00:43:26.981
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then up there as well as the oldest </v>

1003
00:43:26.981 --> 00:43:28.250
<v Speaker 2>human habitation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now that's looking at about.</v>

1004
00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:30.500
<v Speaker 2>Well there's still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the data is still coming in,</v>

1005
00:43:30.890 --> 00:43:32.480
<v Speaker 2>but about 50,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years old.</v>

1006
00:43:32.481 --> 00:43:34.580
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where human habitation on earth,</v>

1007
00:43:35.010 --> 00:43:36.260
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's definitely in Australia,</v>

1008
00:43:36.261 --> 00:43:40.280
<v Speaker 2>in the Kimberley there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure that I'm older than Africa.</v>

1009
00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:43.010
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aboriginal people,</v>

1010
00:43:43.011 --> 00:43:46.040
<v Speaker 2>the native people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they came into Australia once again,</v>

1011
00:43:46.430 --> 00:43:49.060
<v Speaker 2>lots of people very the numbers on this </v>
<v Speaker 2>but about 60,</v>

1012
00:43:49.090 --> 00:43:50.330
<v Speaker 2>70,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>

1013
00:43:50.730 --> 00:43:52.310
<v Speaker 2>So that's when they entered into </v>
<v Speaker 2>Australia.</v>

1014
00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:55.390
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they've been there for a long time,</v>

1015
00:43:55.530 --> 00:43:57.170
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very long time and they're at work.</v>

1016
00:43:57.171 --> 00:43:59.000
<v Speaker 2>They're just will blow you away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1017
00:43:59.050 --> 00:44:01.510
<v Speaker 2>But obviously people were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1018
00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:04.170
<v Speaker 2>they existed in Africa earlier than </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1019
00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:07.730
<v Speaker 2>Homo sapiens sapiens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about 200,000</v>

1020
00:44:07.731 --> 00:44:08.760
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

1021
00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:13.800
<v Speaker 2>that the species,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our species kind of evolved out of </v>

1022
00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:13.800
<v Speaker 2>Africa probably around Kenya,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere around there.</v>

1023
00:44:14.450 --> 00:44:17.270
<v Speaker 2>And then we started migration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1024
00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:19.760
<v Speaker 2>and so we followed the coast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which makes sense.</v>

1025
00:44:19.761 --> 00:44:21.750
<v Speaker 2>Most of our food was in the intertidal </v>
<v Speaker 2>zone.</v>

1026
00:44:22.030 --> 00:44:23.930
<v Speaker 2>That's where our food was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we followed the coast.</v>

1027
00:44:23.931 --> 00:44:28.931
<v Speaker 2>And so you go around basically Middle </v>
<v Speaker 2>East all the way down into Indonesia and</v>

1028
00:44:29.071 --> 00:44:31.860
<v Speaker 2>then across the short canoe ride,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably the first,</v>

1029
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:35.670
<v Speaker 1>the first ocean crossing into Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's about it.</v>

1030
00:44:35.790 --> 00:44:38.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think 70,000,</v>

1031
00:44:38.161 --> 00:44:39.270
<v Speaker 1>60,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

1032
00:44:39.390 --> 00:44:40.860
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1033
00:44:41.010 --> 00:44:45.540
<v Speaker 1>it's a that culture's been there for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>long time and there's a lot we can learn</v>

1034
00:44:45.541 --> 00:44:46.830
<v Speaker 1>from aboriginal people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

1035
00:44:47.070 --> 00:44:48.960
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of interesting stuff.</v>

1036
00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:51.480
<v Speaker 1>Another horrible human rights violation </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you guys did.</v>

1037
00:44:52.290 --> 00:44:56.170
<v Speaker 1>Store aboriginal kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The empire strikes again,</v>

1038
00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:58.280
<v Speaker 1>started to raise them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1039
00:44:58.290 --> 00:45:03.290
<v Speaker 1>we did some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We did some saying we you and I didn't </v>

1040
00:45:03.290 --> 00:45:07.191
<v Speaker 1>kill any sharp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't do it and steal any aboriginal </v>

1041
00:45:07.191 --> 00:45:07.191
<v Speaker 1>babies who can't keep saying we.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1042
00:45:07.191 --> 00:45:07.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm part of humanity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1043
00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.300
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A little bit of blind for it.</v>

1044
00:45:09.670 --> 00:45:11.370
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about blame,</v>

1045
00:45:11.371 --> 00:45:16.371
<v Speaker 1>but we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're a part of the race that has done </v>

1046
00:45:16.371 --> 00:45:16.920
<v Speaker 1>some fucked up shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as also created cell phones.</v>

1047
00:45:17.620 --> 00:45:18.760
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that pool,</v>

1048
00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:20.360
<v Speaker 1>that's all forgiven then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Real planes.</v>

1049
00:45:20.650 --> 00:45:21.660
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not forgiven,</v>

1050
00:45:21.690 --> 00:45:24.490
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of like your perspective thing</v>

1051
00:45:24.530 --> 00:45:25.810
<v Speaker 1>when you talking about sharks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1052
00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:30.910
<v Speaker 1>You gotta put it into perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many people have actually stole </v>

1053
00:45:30.910 --> 00:45:30.910
<v Speaker 1>aboriginal babies?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1054
00:45:30.910 --> 00:45:33.360
<v Speaker 1>when you look at the billions of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the entire planet,</v>

1055
00:45:33.390 --> 00:45:38.390
<v Speaker 1>very few have actually done that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Native cultures have had a really hard </v>

1056
00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:43.250
<v Speaker 1>hard truck and they have and if aliens </v>
<v Speaker 1>landed we'd have a hard time and so </v>

1057
00:45:43.250 --> 00:45:47.811
<v Speaker 1>that's how it always is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most technologically advanced </v>

1058
00:45:47.811 --> 00:45:50.931
<v Speaker 1>society thinks when it finds some sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a native society that's living in a,</v>

1059
00:45:51.281 --> 00:45:53.430
<v Speaker 1>a way that they used to live a long time</v>
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>

1060
00:45:53.431 --> 00:45:53.780
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1061
00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:58.820
<v Speaker 1>you fuckers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't even know what you're doing </v>

1062
00:45:58.820 --> 00:46:00.681
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you got to figure out this whole </v>

1063
00:46:00.681 --> 00:46:00.681
<v Speaker 1>wheel gun thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this whole,</v>

1064
00:46:00.681 --> 00:46:05.151
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were living sustainably and </v>

1065
00:46:05.151 --> 00:46:05.151
<v Speaker 1>environment for them 70,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years and not,</v>

1066
00:46:05.151 --> 00:46:09.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not doing anything basically wrong or </v>

1067
00:46:09.130 --> 00:46:09.130
<v Speaker 1>harming that environment at any stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

1068
00:46:09.130 --> 00:46:09.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know better.</v>

1069
00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:11.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how we think,</v>

1070
00:46:11.131 --> 00:46:13.170
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

1071
00:46:13.171 --> 00:46:18.171
<v Speaker 1>we definitely shouldn't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't want to live on horseback </v>

1072
00:46:18.171 --> 00:46:19.110
<v Speaker 1>and chase buffalo with a stick.</v>

1073
00:46:21.330 --> 00:46:21.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hear this,</v>

1074
00:46:21.961 --> 00:46:26.961
<v Speaker 1>everyone thinks that doing something </v>
<v Speaker 1>about climate change or environment or </v>

1075
00:46:26.961 --> 00:46:28.700
<v Speaker 1>something is gonna make a reduction in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

1076
00:46:28.750 --> 00:46:29.790
<v Speaker 1>your living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1077
00:46:29.791 --> 00:46:34.791
<v Speaker 1>that's a totally different argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about invading into places </v>

1078
00:46:34.791 --> 00:46:34.791
<v Speaker 1>where people are living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1079
00:46:34.791 --> 00:46:36.210
<v Speaker 1>this digitas lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1080
00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:38.340
<v Speaker 1>this is an issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have them right now in the Amazon.</v>

1081
00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:41.600
<v Speaker 1>These tribes that are essentially </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely they,</v>

1082
00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:46.230
<v Speaker 1>they're almost non influenced by Western</v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization,</v>

1083
00:46:46.290 --> 00:46:50.400
<v Speaker 1>but I mean when you come to like </v>
<v Speaker 1>changing lifestyle and things to make up</v>

1084
00:46:50.401 --> 00:46:52.140
<v Speaker 1>for what we're doing to the environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1085
00:46:52.141 --> 00:46:55.770
<v Speaker 1>No arguments here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is obviously some shit going down.</v>

1086
00:46:56.110 --> 00:46:57.360
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a little warm out.</v>

1087
00:46:57.510 --> 00:46:59.610
<v Speaker 1>Lately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a little warm at lately.</v>

1088
00:47:00.510 --> 00:47:01.450
<v Speaker 1>Last month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was it?</v>

1089
00:47:01.540 --> 00:47:06.360
<v Speaker 1>The northern hemisphere two degrees </v>
<v Speaker 1>above industrial times Celsius is.</v>

1090
00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:10.500
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know I'm better than cooling though.</v>

1091
00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:12.780
<v Speaker 1>Cooling is much more terrifying.</v>

1092
00:47:12.810 --> 00:47:17.300
<v Speaker 1>Global Cooling is horrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when populations dropoff.</v>

1093
00:47:17.310 --> 00:47:19.950
<v Speaker 1>That's when innovation drops off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when it gets really scary.</v>

1094
00:47:19.951 --> 00:47:22.470
<v Speaker 1>I would say the warming since going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be just as bad.</v>

1095
00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:27.740
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever read any of the work or </v>
<v Speaker 1>listened to any of the work by Randall </v>

1096
00:47:27.740 --> 00:47:28.350
<v Speaker 1>Carlson is a fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating,</v>

1097
00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:31.300
<v Speaker 1>but I can't recall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been on the podcast several times.</v>

1098
00:47:31.301 --> 00:47:33.700
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you've heard them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're it with Graham Hancock as well,</v>

1099
00:47:33.701 --> 00:47:37.900
<v Speaker 1>but he's an expert in impacts and </v>
<v Speaker 1>asteroid impacts.</v>

1100
00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:39.130
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1101
00:47:39.131 --> 00:47:41.560
<v Speaker 1>He was doing this stuff out of Utah or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

1102
00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:46.860
<v Speaker 1>all the glacial thing and he's basically</v>
<v Speaker 1>taken his entire life studying both </v>

1103
00:47:52.031 --> 00:47:53.740
<v Speaker 1>climate change that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1104
00:47:54.130 --> 00:47:55.960
<v Speaker 1>prehistoric climate change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>climate change,</v>

1105
00:47:55.961 --> 00:48:00.961
<v Speaker 1>but within the last ice age until now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and connecting some of the climate </v>

1106
00:48:00.971 --> 00:48:05.971
<v Speaker 1>change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of it with a impacts with </v>

1107
00:48:05.971 --> 00:48:06.220
<v Speaker 1>asteroidal impacts at the end of the ice</v>
<v Speaker 1>age,</v>

1108
00:48:06.610 --> 00:48:07.180
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1109
00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:09.990
<v Speaker 1>10 plus down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would it not like,</v>

1110
00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:13.230
<v Speaker 1>well there's evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actual evidence of impacts and,</v>

1111
00:48:13.231 --> 00:48:14.140
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

1112
00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:16.990
<v Speaker 1>what they call nuclear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a nuclear glass,</v>

1113
00:48:17.290 --> 00:48:19.870
<v Speaker 1>I think it's called [inaudible] night </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's from a,</v>

1114
00:48:19.970 --> 00:48:22.240
<v Speaker 1>you get it when they do nuclear test </v>
<v Speaker 1>sites,</v>

1115
00:48:22.241 --> 00:48:27.241
<v Speaker 1>they find it and you also get it from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>meteor impact sites and it's just like </v>

1116
00:48:27.241 --> 00:48:31.530
<v Speaker 1>really cool looking green glass where </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ground understands.</v>

1117
00:48:32.020 --> 00:48:32.920
<v Speaker 1>Tend to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1118
00:48:33.070 --> 00:48:37.420
<v Speaker 1>But it's all over Europe and Asia and </v>
<v Speaker 1>around 12,000</v>

1119
00:48:37.421 --> 00:48:42.421
<v Speaker 1>years and they are pointing to that as </v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence of a massive impacts.</v>

1120
00:48:42.690 --> 00:48:44.890
<v Speaker 1>Like we got hit by everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1121
00:48:44.891 --> 00:48:46.150
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the layman always goes,</v>

1122
00:48:46.180 --> 00:48:46.900
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last unit,</v>

1123
00:48:46.940 --> 00:48:49.030
<v Speaker 1>big impact 65 million years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1124
00:48:49.031 --> 00:48:51.340
<v Speaker 1>the kt boundary with dinosaurs and stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

1125
00:48:51.610 --> 00:48:54.940
<v Speaker 1>There has been impacts constant since </v>
<v Speaker 1>then and uh,</v>

1126
00:48:55.210 --> 00:49:00.210
<v Speaker 1>and this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just need more evidence basically to </v>

1127
00:49:00.210 --> 00:49:00.210
<v Speaker 1>fill in the gaps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's been a lot of impacts.</v>

1128
00:49:00.210 --> 00:49:04.801
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't surprise me in our lifetime </v>

1129
00:49:04.801 --> 00:49:04.801
<v Speaker 1>that we see an impact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1130
00:49:04.801 --> 00:49:05.310
<v Speaker 1>we will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1131
00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:09.010
<v Speaker 1>we certainly have on other planets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We saw a giant one on Jupiter that was,</v>

1132
00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:10.390
<v Speaker 1>that was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1133
00:49:10.530 --> 00:49:11.700
<v Speaker 1>She Maka leave it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1134
00:49:11.890 --> 00:49:16.890
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shoemaker Levy was as large as the </v>

1135
00:49:16.890 --> 00:49:17.920
<v Speaker 1>entire planet earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how big the impact was.</v>

1136
00:49:18.690 --> 00:49:19.870
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the rock itself.</v>

1137
00:49:19.871 --> 00:49:23.290
<v Speaker 1>The impact of the implosion was as large</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the planet earth.</v>

1138
00:49:26.580 --> 00:49:28.510
<v Speaker 1>Apparently that's the place to use your </v>
<v Speaker 1>budget.</v>

1139
00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:29.230
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe,</v>

1140
00:49:29.231 --> 00:49:29.910
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1141
00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:31.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's come a bit of space.</v>

1142
00:49:31.620 --> 00:49:32.500
<v Speaker 1>Defensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1143
00:49:32.501 --> 00:49:34.510
<v Speaker 1>I hope they can figure that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll think about it.</v>

1144
00:49:34.511 --> 00:49:38.260
<v Speaker 1>We probably the first species on this </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet to ever get to the point where we</v>

1145
00:49:38.261 --> 00:49:42.850
<v Speaker 1>could we have the technology to defend </v>
<v Speaker 1>the planet from these cataclysmic events</v>

1146
00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:45.580
<v Speaker 1>were the first people to have that </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability,</v>

1147
00:49:45.581 --> 00:49:50.581
<v Speaker 1>but we're not using it well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're the first people to come close to </v>

1148
00:49:50.581 --> 00:49:53.050
<v Speaker 1>having that ability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they have some inkling as to how</v>

1149
00:49:53.051 --> 00:49:57.310
<v Speaker 1>to do that right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a coating them with some sort of a,</v>

1150
00:49:57.320 --> 00:50:01.030
<v Speaker 1>a silicone or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For whites.</v>

1151
00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:03.550
<v Speaker 1>You nudge them and nudge them is easiest</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

1152
00:50:03.551 --> 00:50:08.551
<v Speaker 1>You just go land something on them with </v>
<v Speaker 1>a rocket on it and then stopped burning </v>

1153
00:50:08.551 --> 00:50:12.151
<v Speaker 1>that rocket and if you do it early </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough you will change the trajectory </v>

1154
00:50:12.151 --> 00:50:15.511
<v Speaker 1>enough to see this so many of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's part of the problem,</v>

1155
00:50:17.201 --> 00:50:18.920
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like $900,000</v>

1156
00:50:18.930 --> 00:50:20.650
<v Speaker 1>year herth objects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1157
00:50:20.651 --> 00:50:25.651
<v Speaker 1>but it's within our power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can do it and it's crazy that we're </v>

1158
00:50:25.651 --> 00:50:28.340
<v Speaker 1>not because really that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's something can really mess</v>

1159
00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:29.780
<v Speaker 2>up society that we currently have.</v>

1160
00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:31.920
<v Speaker 3>That's a nice way of putting it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mess Up.</v>

1161
00:50:32.370 --> 00:50:35.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe Australia be the spot.</v>

1162
00:50:35.131 --> 00:50:36.170
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you guys have been hit too.</v>

1163
00:50:36.171 --> 00:50:38.580
<v Speaker 3>That was one of the things that Randall </v>
<v Speaker 3>concentrated on.</v>

1164
00:50:38.581 --> 00:50:43.581
<v Speaker 3>He showed these slides last time he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>here maybe the time before that where he</v>

1165
00:50:44.041 --> 00:50:49.041
<v Speaker 3>showed these massive tsunami erosion </v>
<v Speaker 3>marks all over this one area of </v>

1166
00:50:49.041 --> 00:50:53.991
<v Speaker 3>Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which indicate there was something that </v>

1167
00:50:53.991 --> 00:50:56.631
<v Speaker 3>landed in the ocean off the coast and </v>
<v Speaker 3>just caused massive,</v>

1168
00:50:56.760 --> 00:50:58.740
<v Speaker 3>massive tidal waves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he was saying,</v>

1169
00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:00.800
<v Speaker 3>if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere around 6,000</v>

1170
00:51:00.850 --> 00:51:02.020
<v Speaker 3>plus years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1171
00:51:02.490 --> 00:51:02.730
<v Speaker 3>But</v>

1172
00:51:03.530 --> 00:51:06.000
<v Speaker 2>those tidal waves from earthquakes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1173
00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:11.020
<v Speaker 2>you don't even have to have an impact </v>
<v Speaker 2>against an army coming in and the </v>

1174
00:51:11.020 --> 00:51:11.930
<v Speaker 2>tsunami,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't remember the one sort of in</v>

1175
00:51:11.931 --> 00:51:16.931
<v Speaker 2>Indonesia and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Sri Lanka liked it can do a lot of </v>

1176
00:51:16.931 --> 00:51:16.931
<v Speaker 2>damage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1177
00:51:16.931 --> 00:51:18.530
<v Speaker 3>I was looking at your notes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1178
00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:20.730
<v Speaker 3>Did you see a Ufo?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1179
00:51:21.590 --> 00:51:24.230
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it's a flying</v>

1180
00:51:24.230 --> 00:51:25.100
<v Speaker 2>object.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes I did.</v>

1181
00:51:25.700 --> 00:51:29.090
<v Speaker 2>Was it little aliens in green men?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not too sure on that one.</v>

1182
00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:34.280
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think it might've been need more </v>

1183
00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:34.280
<v Speaker 2>evidence?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1184
00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:37.160
<v Speaker 2>where was it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I spent a lot of time on boats when I</v>

1185
00:51:37.161 --> 00:51:38.020
<v Speaker 2>was growing up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1186
00:51:38.060 --> 00:51:40.570
<v Speaker 2>so I would spend months or months added,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>

1187
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:42.620
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'd regularly,</v>

1188
00:51:42.621 --> 00:51:43.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be in the middle of nowhere,</v>

1189
00:51:43.850 --> 00:51:46.370
<v Speaker 2>thousand kilometers from the nearest </v>
<v Speaker 2>town,</v>

1190
00:51:46.371 --> 00:51:49.250
<v Speaker 2>a light source.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you'd go out middle of the night,</v>

1191
00:51:49.251 --> 00:51:54.251
<v Speaker 2>go to the toilet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a toilet on a boat is basically go over </v>

1192
00:51:54.251 --> 00:51:54.251
<v Speaker 2>to the side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hang,</v>

1193
00:51:54.251 --> 00:51:55.640
<v Speaker 2>hanging over the railing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1194
00:51:55.820 --> 00:51:58.280
<v Speaker 2>and so you look at these stats like and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there you see this,</v>

1195
00:51:58.350 --> 00:51:59.600
<v Speaker 2>you see satellites,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see,</v>

1196
00:51:59.601 --> 00:52:00.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most,</v>

1197
00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:06.340
<v Speaker 2>most people I don't think even have ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>seen the amount of stars you can get </v>

1198
00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:09.701
<v Speaker 2>when you get to a very remote location </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the point where you see individual </v>

1199
00:52:09.701 --> 00:52:09.701
<v Speaker 2>satellites going over and stuff like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1200
00:52:09.701 --> 00:52:12.650
<v Speaker 2>And so that's what I grew up doing most </v>
<v Speaker 2>nights,</v>

1201
00:52:12.670 --> 00:52:17.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would be sitting there and looking at </v>

1202
00:52:17.670 --> 00:52:19.361
<v Speaker 2>this and once or twice I did see some </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff that you go hang on and being a </v>

1203
00:52:19.461 --> 00:52:22.700
<v Speaker 2>bit of a bit of an aviation buff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love sort of space and aviation go,</v>

1204
00:52:22.940 --> 00:52:24.350
<v Speaker 2>hang on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not quite right.</v>

1205
00:52:24.351 --> 00:52:27.530
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't make sense of how that </v>
<v Speaker 2>object went that way.</v>

1206
00:52:27.531 --> 00:52:28.760
<v Speaker 2>And then turned around and went the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other way.</v>

1207
00:52:28.790 --> 00:52:30.560
<v Speaker 2>How old were you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1208
00:52:30.580 --> 00:52:33.450
<v Speaker 2>we were talking between 10 to 15,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere in there.</v>

1209
00:52:35.210 --> 00:52:40.210
<v Speaker 2>My memory between that age is dog shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was more than one on one </v>

1210
00:52:40.210 --> 00:52:41.510
<v Speaker 2>occasion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're in the middle of nowhere.</v>

1211
00:52:41.540 --> 00:52:43.490
<v Speaker 2>Like we were literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there was ever,</v>

1212
00:52:43.970 --> 00:52:47.210
<v Speaker 2>if you're doing a secret military,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which a plane flight or something,</v>

1213
00:52:47.211 --> 00:52:49.400
<v Speaker 2>that would be the place to do it because</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're in the middle of nowhere.</v>

1214
00:52:49.530 --> 00:52:50.930
<v Speaker 2>And what did you say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did you do?</v>

1215
00:52:51.390 --> 00:52:53.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm seeing some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some big lights,</v>

1216
00:52:54.110 --> 00:52:57.140
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to slow a fair distance.</v>

1217
00:52:57.141 --> 00:52:58.450
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing over and over I think.</v>

1218
00:52:58.460 --> 00:53:00.170
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going off into the distance.</v>

1219
00:53:00.350 --> 00:53:05.350
<v Speaker 2>And then I remember seeing one time </v>
<v Speaker 2>where I went out there and started doing</v>

1220
00:53:06.321 --> 00:53:08.780
<v Speaker 2>my thing and then I saw a light that </v>
<v Speaker 2>looked like,</v>

1221
00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:09.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Venus,</v>

1222
00:53:09.490 --> 00:53:11.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a bright star.</v>

1223
00:53:11.020 --> 00:53:11.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hmm,</v>

1224
00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:16.720
<v Speaker 2>that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bit light for Venus to be up because </v>

1225
00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:16.720
<v Speaker 2>normally Venus's right at the start,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sunset sunrise.</v>

1226
00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:19.650
<v Speaker 2>So I think it's a bit strange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you know,</v>

1227
00:53:19.690 --> 00:53:24.690
<v Speaker 2>and then you look back and it's moved </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then hang on and then you try and </v>

1228
00:53:24.690 --> 00:53:25.260
<v Speaker 2>work it out with the boat moving and </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that.</v>

1229
00:53:25.290 --> 00:53:26.100
<v Speaker 2>And then it just started</v>

1230
00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:28.050
<v Speaker 1>to move and then turn around and move </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other way.</v>

1231
00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:30.780
<v Speaker 1>And it's just like my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from my knowledge of aviation,</v>

1232
00:53:30.781 --> 00:53:31.560
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eh,</v>

1233
00:53:31.561 --> 00:53:33.060
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can do that.</v>

1234
00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:35.640
<v Speaker 1>So what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>

1235
00:53:35.641 --> 00:53:38.150
<v Speaker 1>But I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find the whole thing fascinating.</v>

1236
00:53:38.151 --> 00:53:39.690
<v Speaker 1>I find it interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1237
00:53:39.691 --> 00:53:42.060
<v Speaker 1>I think I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>well first of all,</v>

1238
00:53:42.061 --> 00:53:45.240
<v Speaker 1>I want to believe so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always have,</v>

1239
00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:50.300
<v Speaker 1>from the time I was a child and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>many people share that romantic notion </v>

1240
00:53:50.300 --> 00:53:53.600
<v Speaker 1>of how amazing it would be if we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>visited by some intelligent life.</v>

1241
00:53:53.630 --> 00:53:55.950
<v Speaker 1>We're not aliens and it's a big waste of</v>
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>

1242
00:53:56.580 --> 00:54:01.580
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most likely is something alive out </v>

1243
00:54:01.580 --> 00:54:04.911
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question is whether or not it's </v>

1244
00:54:04.911 --> 00:54:04.911
<v Speaker 1>visiting us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1245
00:54:04.911 --> 00:54:08.720
<v Speaker 1>and if it did visit us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would have to be so far removed from </v>

1246
00:54:09.451 --> 00:54:13.440
<v Speaker 1>what we think is possible and as far as </v>
<v Speaker 1>like technology,</v>

1247
00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:17.670
<v Speaker 1>but we also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think part of what's going on with our</v>

1248
00:54:17.671 --> 00:54:22.671
<v Speaker 1>own minds when we consider the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we know that technology keeps </v>

1249
00:54:22.671 --> 00:54:24.060
<v Speaker 1>improving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we keep innovating,</v>

1250
00:54:24.061 --> 00:54:29.061
<v Speaker 1>we keep coming up with new methods for </v>
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of different things and one </v>

1251
00:54:29.061 --> 00:54:32.811
<v Speaker 1>day we're most likely going to be able </v>
<v Speaker 1>to regularly journey to other parts of </v>

1252
00:54:32.811 --> 00:54:32.880
<v Speaker 1>the universe.</v>

1253
00:54:32.970 --> 00:54:35.640
<v Speaker 1>Most likely if we raised NASA's budget </v>
<v Speaker 1>slightly,</v>

1254
00:54:35.910 --> 00:54:36.870
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing new.</v>

1255
00:54:37.110 --> 00:54:39.840
<v Speaker 1>Well I think private sector is probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>the best option.</v>

1256
00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:43.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean when when people start finding </v>
<v Speaker 1>profit in visiting,</v>

1257
00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:46.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean if they can figure out how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>mine for diamonds,</v>

1258
00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:48.960
<v Speaker 1>is there like one of Jupiter's moons or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that?</v>

1259
00:54:48.961 --> 00:54:51.530
<v Speaker 1>It's made out of fucking diamonds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like moments.</v>

1260
00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:56.600
<v Speaker 1>It's actually another planet they found </v>
<v Speaker 1>out in the like one of the newly </v>

1261
00:54:56.600 --> 00:54:57.470
<v Speaker 1>discovered planets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Planets,</v>

1262
00:54:57.480 --> 00:55:00.420
<v Speaker 1>if you find that there's a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet made out of diamonds out there,</v>

1263
00:55:00.450 --> 00:55:05.450
<v Speaker 1>well we think based on looking at </v>
<v Speaker 1>wavelengths of light coming from </v>

1264
00:55:05.450 --> 00:55:07.350
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of light years away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not really.</v>

1265
00:55:07.351 --> 00:55:08.150
<v Speaker 1>We.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>

1266
00:55:10.010 --> 00:55:12.120
<v Speaker 1>could you get it here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

1267
00:55:12.180 --> 00:55:12.740
<v Speaker 1>Language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1268
00:55:12.750 --> 00:55:15.930
<v Speaker 1>English is a astronomers discover a </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet made of diamonds.</v>

1269
00:55:15.990 --> 00:55:20.990
<v Speaker 1>Jesus called riced racing around a tiny </v>
<v Speaker 1>star and our galactic backyard,</v>

1270
00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:26.520
<v Speaker 1>so if they could figure out how to visit</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they had below a fuck.</v>

1271
00:55:26.550 --> 00:55:29.130
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>diamonds would be worth like a dollar.</v>

1272
00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:35.040
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that whole gravity waves thing </v>

1273
00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:35.040
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a great step forward.</v>

1274
00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:37.320
<v Speaker 1>Then suddenly we are seeing that you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>adjust gravity.</v>

1275
00:55:37.350 --> 00:55:39.630
<v Speaker 1>Gravity is adjustable to a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree.</v>

1276
00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:44.520
<v Speaker 1>That's probably where the interstellar </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology will come from.</v>

1277
00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:47.610
<v Speaker 1>More research into that area and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that we just kind of.</v>

1278
00:55:47.940 --> 00:55:52.940
<v Speaker 1>We.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just proved that concept that they </v>

1279
00:55:52.940 --> 00:55:54.450
<v Speaker 1>sort of bastardized in the event </v>
<v Speaker 1>horizon.</v>

1280
00:55:54.870 --> 00:55:59.870
<v Speaker 1>You ever seen that movie where they talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about folding space time and punching a </v>

1281
00:55:59.870 --> 00:56:02.130
<v Speaker 1>hole through the two points,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you would surmount.</v>

1282
00:56:02.490 --> 00:56:07.490
<v Speaker 1>You would rather you would traverse </v>
<v Speaker 1>insurmountable distances and a very </v>

1283
00:56:08.251 --> 00:56:13.251
<v Speaker 1>short period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My understanding is that's wound whole </v>

1284
00:56:13.251 --> 00:56:16.020
<v Speaker 1>log where with the gravity waves it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably star trek does it well </v>

1285
00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:20.340
<v Speaker 1>enterprise where you basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just adjusting this,</v>

1286
00:56:20.430 --> 00:56:24.070
<v Speaker 1>the fabric of space time in front and </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind the ship and so</v>

1287
00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:25.900
<v Speaker 3>you're not moving faster than the speed </v>
<v Speaker 3>of light.</v>

1288
00:56:25.901 --> 00:56:29.730
<v Speaker 3>You're just kind of making a bubble in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the space time that you then traveling.</v>

1289
00:56:29.970 --> 00:56:34.970
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fascinating when you read right </v>

1290
00:56:34.970 --> 00:56:34.970
<v Speaker 3>into it and I think that's probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>where it'll come from.</v>

1291
00:56:34.970 --> 00:56:37.330
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need a lot more studying on that one.</v>

1292
00:56:37.530 --> 00:56:39.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think you'll get there.</v>

1293
00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:41.110
<v Speaker 3>But we will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if we,</v>

1294
00:56:41.111 --> 00:56:43.210
<v Speaker 3>if humans survive 100,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>

1295
00:56:43.510 --> 00:56:45.760
<v Speaker 3>I mean imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's the concept.</v>

1296
00:56:45.761 --> 00:56:48.640
<v Speaker 3>The concept is if there is some life </v>
<v Speaker 3>form out there,</v>

1297
00:56:48.910 --> 00:56:53.410
<v Speaker 3>we've been alive or this planet rather </v>
<v Speaker 3>has been around for four point something</v>

1298
00:56:53.411 --> 00:56:58.411
<v Speaker 3>billion years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if something just had a different </v>

1299
00:56:58.411 --> 00:57:02.581
<v Speaker 3>combination of elements and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>perhaps lives in a protected area where </v>

1300
00:57:02.581 --> 00:57:06.181
<v Speaker 3>they don't have a gigantic asteroid </v>
<v Speaker 3>field just outside of distance between </v>

1301
00:57:06.760 --> 00:57:07.950
<v Speaker 3>Mars and Jupiter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1302
00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:13.040
<v Speaker 3>like we do or I mean there's only,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's comments and they might live in </v>

1303
00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:15.350
<v Speaker 3>some protected area where they have more</v>
<v Speaker 3>freedom to,</v>

1304
00:57:15.351 --> 00:57:16.840
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to grow and innovate.</v>

1305
00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:19.330
<v Speaker 3>And we're in a goldilocks zone if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>really look into it.</v>

1306
00:57:19.331 --> 00:57:20.840
<v Speaker 3>Like for us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we totally,</v>

1307
00:57:20.850 --> 00:57:22.270
<v Speaker 3>Nicole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it looks on the moon,</v>

1308
00:57:22.570 --> 00:57:23.830
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

1309
00:57:23.940 --> 00:57:28.940
<v Speaker 3>the dinosaurs is only 65 million years </v>
<v Speaker 3>ago got completely fucking smashed by a </v>

1310
00:57:28.940 --> 00:57:30.610
<v Speaker 3>rock like that could happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1311
00:57:30.611 --> 00:57:35.611
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the big crater outside Nevada like </v>

1312
00:57:35.611 --> 00:57:37.880
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so many of them that could mean </v>

1313
00:57:37.880 --> 00:57:39.760
<v Speaker 3>that it is possible though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there is a source system out there </v>

1314
00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:42.931
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't have this issue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that for whatever reason doesn't have </v>

1315
00:57:42.931 --> 00:57:47.340
<v Speaker 3>nearly as many asteroids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so some life form has been </v>

1316
00:57:47.340 --> 00:57:50.050
<v Speaker 3>innovating for millions of years more </v>
<v Speaker 3>than us.</v>

1317
00:57:50.950 --> 00:57:52.660
<v Speaker 3>But that is when we can do that right </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

1318
00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:55.840
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have the technology right now to stop</v>

1319
00:57:55.900 --> 00:58:00.900
<v Speaker 3>these cataclysmic impacts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you're being a little.</v>

1320
00:58:01.170 --> 00:58:04.690
<v Speaker 3>I didn't say this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they miss a lot of them,</v>

1321
00:58:04.990 --> 00:58:09.990
<v Speaker 3>a good percentage of them because of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>gravity and the way the sun is and the </v>

1322
00:58:10.361 --> 00:58:15.361
<v Speaker 3>sun is so fucking massive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a million times larger than the earth </v>

1323
00:58:15.361 --> 00:58:15.450
<v Speaker 3>that I think when things are coming </v>
<v Speaker 3>behind the sun,</v>

1324
00:58:15.640 --> 00:58:20.640
<v Speaker 3>oftentimes they don't even see them </v>
<v Speaker 3>until it's too late and until we could </v>

1325
00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:24.151
<v Speaker 3>figure that out and you've got these </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking Manhattan sized chunks or rock </v>

1326
00:58:24.151 --> 00:58:26.380
<v Speaker 3>for in our way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think a one day maybe we'll be able to</v>

1327
00:58:26.381 --> 00:58:31.381
<v Speaker 3>do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but my point being that it is possible </v>

1328
00:58:31.381 --> 00:58:32.560
<v Speaker 3>that there's some sort of a civilization</v>
<v Speaker 3>out there that doesn't have to deal with</v>

1329
00:58:32.561 --> 00:58:37.561
<v Speaker 3>impacts that may be maybe they've </v>
<v Speaker 3>developed in a way that they don't have </v>

1330
00:58:37.561 --> 00:58:38.260
<v Speaker 3>predators the way we do.</v>

1331
00:58:38.310 --> 00:58:41.050
<v Speaker 3>They haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't have this need for,</v>

1332
00:58:41.620 --> 00:58:46.620
<v Speaker 3>for warfare the way that we do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they have some unique method of </v>

1333
00:58:46.620 --> 00:58:49.690
<v Speaker 3>communication that allows for more </v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding than just mouth noises.</v>

1334
00:58:50.470 --> 00:58:51.190
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1335
00:58:51.191 --> 00:58:52.810
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't say it's a need,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it is.</v>

1336
00:58:53.380 --> 00:58:57.520
<v Speaker 3>It is prevalent throughout history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it seems to be a part of humans.</v>

1337
00:58:57.970 --> 00:59:02.970
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's arguable that we can move past it </v>

1338
00:59:02.970 --> 00:59:02.970
<v Speaker 3>for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I certainly hope we can.</v>

1339
00:59:02.970 --> 00:59:05.110
<v Speaker 3>Obviously we can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can do it in small groups.</v>

1340
00:59:05.111 --> 00:59:06.270
<v Speaker 3>We can do it in cities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can do,</v>

1341
00:59:06.580 --> 00:59:09.490
<v Speaker 3>but war has existed as long as humans </v>
<v Speaker 3>have existed.</v>

1342
00:59:09.790 --> 00:59:13.230
<v Speaker 3>So you would say if you were studying </v>
<v Speaker 3>human beings objectively,</v>

1343
00:59:13.240 --> 00:59:14.770
<v Speaker 3>not idealistically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>

1344
00:59:15.070 --> 00:59:16.900
<v Speaker 3>not looking at things through rose </v>
<v Speaker 3>colored glasses,</v>

1345
00:59:16.901 --> 00:59:17.830
<v Speaker 3>you would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1346
00:59:17.831 --> 00:59:20.050
<v Speaker 3>this is what humans do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the things they do.</v>

1347
00:59:20.250 --> 00:59:21.950
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you were studying us as an animal,</v>

1348
00:59:21.951 --> 00:59:23.810
<v Speaker 3>if you were some species from another </v>
<v Speaker 3>planet,</v>

1349
00:59:23.811 --> 00:59:24.290
<v Speaker 3>you'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1350
00:59:24.291 --> 00:59:26.990
<v Speaker 3>they do shoot each other a lot as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>collective group.</v>

1351
00:59:27.410 --> 00:59:29.450
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go to the individual level.</v>

1352
00:59:29.451 --> 00:59:30.800
<v Speaker 3>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1353
00:59:30.801 --> 00:59:32.720
<v Speaker 3>I think the opinion is totally </v>
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>

1354
00:59:32.750 --> 00:59:35.330
<v Speaker 3>You go to an individual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't want to kill other people.</v>

1355
00:59:35.720 --> 00:59:37.610
<v Speaker 3>It's in human nature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't want to kill other people.</v>

1356
00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:39.550
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean it just objective.</v>

1357
00:59:39.830 --> 00:59:44.830
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of like the way you look at </v>

1358
00:59:44.830 --> 00:59:44.830
<v Speaker 3>sharks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1359
00:59:44.830 --> 00:59:44.830
<v Speaker 3>and you look at sharks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you say,</v>

1360
00:59:44.830 --> 00:59:44.830
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1361
00:59:44.830 --> 00:59:45.650
<v Speaker 3>they only kill five of us a year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you know,</v>

1362
00:59:45.651 --> 00:59:47.120
<v Speaker 3>really they're harmless.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1363
00:59:47.121 --> 00:59:49.310
<v Speaker 3>they are kind of harmless them to one of</v>
<v Speaker 3>them fucking bites you,</v>

1364
00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:54.680
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's sort of the same way about </v>

1365
00:59:54.680 --> 00:59:54.680
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1366
00:59:54.680 --> 00:59:54.890
<v Speaker 3>most of the time humans are wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of the Times people are like,</v>

1367
00:59:54.891 --> 00:59:56.990
<v Speaker 3>you and I have a drink,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we clink glasses,</v>

1368
00:59:56.991 --> 01:00:01.991
<v Speaker 3>we enjoy our company,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have a great chat and that's most of </v>

1369
01:00:01.991 --> 01:00:03.890
<v Speaker 3>the interactions you're ever going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have with people are great most,</v>

1370
01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:08.920
<v Speaker 3>most times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the vast majority of interactions </v>

1371
01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:12.101
<v Speaker 3>you have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially in America where there's </v>

1372
01:00:12.101 --> 01:00:14.381
<v Speaker 3>plenty of food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's plenty of space and people are </v>

1373
01:00:14.381 --> 01:00:14.381
<v Speaker 3>well taken care of.</v>

1374
01:00:14.381 --> 01:00:15.200
<v Speaker 3>Most of the time everything's gonna be </v>
<v Speaker 3>great,</v>

1375
01:00:15.590 --> 01:00:20.590
<v Speaker 3>but when you tally up the numbers for 7 </v>
<v Speaker 3>billion people and then the battle for </v>

1376
01:00:21.171 --> 01:00:26.171
<v Speaker 3>natural resources and then religious </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideologies come into play and there's a </v>

1377
01:00:26.171 --> 01:00:28.580
<v Speaker 3>lot of fucking killing going on </v>
<v Speaker 3>constantly.</v>

1378
01:00:28.730 --> 01:00:29.240
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1379
01:00:29.241 --> 01:00:30.650
<v Speaker 3>so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an unavoidable.</v>

1380
01:00:30.870 --> 01:00:35.870
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could certainly make the argument </v>

1381
01:00:35.870 --> 01:00:38.471
<v Speaker 3>that we can do better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you just want it to look at us </v>

1382
01:00:38.471 --> 01:00:38.471
<v Speaker 3>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just know ideology attached.</v>

1383
01:00:38.471 --> 01:00:41.150
<v Speaker 3>Just look at what a human being is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Human beings killed.</v>

1384
01:00:41.540 --> 01:00:46.540
<v Speaker 3>We're killing all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're killing each other all over the </v>

1385
01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:48.761
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just happening right now as we're </v>

1386
01:00:48.761 --> 01:00:50.231
<v Speaker 3>talking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's people shooting people is bombs </v>

1387
01:00:50.231 --> 01:00:50.690
<v Speaker 3>going off and people killing themselves </v>
<v Speaker 3>as it's going on.</v>

1388
01:00:50.990 --> 01:00:55.990
<v Speaker 3>So it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is a part of human beings that we </v>

1389
01:00:55.990 --> 01:00:57.440
<v Speaker 3>have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have come to accept,</v>

1390
01:00:57.470 --> 01:01:00.980
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't necessarily mean that </v>
<v Speaker 3>other life forms have this,</v>

1391
01:01:01.460 --> 01:01:01.670
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1392
01:01:01.670 --> 01:01:05.060
<v Speaker 3>I mean there it is potentially possible </v>
<v Speaker 3>to wasted resources.</v>

1393
01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:08.870
<v Speaker 3>Any evolved alien that we've ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>encountered.</v>

1394
01:01:08.871 --> 01:01:12.680
<v Speaker 3>I would say very unlikely that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>would do will fit because it's just such</v>

1395
01:01:12.681 --> 01:01:14.050
<v Speaker 3>a waste of resources.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>

1396
01:01:14.051 --> 01:01:15.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you get to interstellar travel?</v>

1397
01:01:15.581 --> 01:01:19.010
<v Speaker 3>If you spending all your money working </v>
<v Speaker 3>on new ways to kill each other,</v>

1398
01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:20.240
<v Speaker 3>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't work well.</v>

1399
01:01:20.241 --> 01:01:23.780
<v Speaker 3>Also like what's the benefit of it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what is the benefit of it?</v>

1400
01:01:23.781 --> 01:01:28.781
<v Speaker 3>The benefit of it is all personal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all like a whatever group gets to </v>

1401
01:01:28.781 --> 01:01:30.230
<v Speaker 3>dominate the resources,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever group gets to,</v>

1402
01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:31.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe their,</v>

1403
01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:35.090
<v Speaker 3>their genetics pass on Gangam style,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whereas the,</v>

1404
01:01:35.091 --> 01:01:36.920
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people that were dominated,</v>

1405
01:01:36.921 --> 01:01:41.921
<v Speaker 3>they don't get to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all very primitive and a lot of </v>

1406
01:01:41.921 --> 01:01:41.921
<v Speaker 3>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very animalistic.</v>

1407
01:01:41.921 --> 01:01:43.730
<v Speaker 3>The biggest Dick Syndrome now in some </v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

1408
01:01:43.790 --> 01:01:46.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a genetic thing,</v>

1409
01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:48.680
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if we get past that,</v>

1410
01:01:49.130 --> 01:01:54.130
<v Speaker 3>like one of the weirder things in Ufo </v>
<v Speaker 3>folklore is the idea of genetic </v>

1411
01:01:54.951 --> 01:01:59.951
<v Speaker 3>manipulation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea that human beings have been </v>

1412
01:01:59.951 --> 01:02:00.550
<v Speaker 3>created by which the lady six files </v>
<v Speaker 3>video.</v>

1413
01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:01.340
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did not.</v>

1414
01:02:01.341 --> 01:02:03.320
<v Speaker 3>I haven't seen the new x files.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it good?</v>

1415
01:02:04.790 --> 01:02:06.590
<v Speaker 3>Is it on Fox again?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1416
01:02:06.591 --> 01:02:08.410
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What time is it now?</v>

1417
01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:10.400
<v Speaker 3>I think it's great that they're doing it</v>
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>

1418
01:02:10.410 --> 01:02:12.560
<v Speaker 3>I probably should watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the old one.</v>

1419
01:02:12.650 --> 01:02:17.650
<v Speaker 3>The reason I bring it up is because </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's pretty much what the last two </v>

1420
01:02:17.650 --> 01:02:18.260
<v Speaker 3>episodes is all about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's going on and on about that.</v>

1421
01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:20.520
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a big theme</v>

1422
01:02:21.090 --> 01:02:25.440
<v Speaker 1>in Ufo Folk Lore and also in Zechariah </v>
<v Speaker 1>sections work.</v>

1423
01:02:26.290 --> 01:02:28.140
<v Speaker 1>Do you know about that guy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once again?</v>

1424
01:02:28.141 --> 01:02:29.670
<v Speaker 1>Heard of him to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think about anything.</v>

1425
01:02:29.671 --> 01:02:34.671
<v Speaker 1>He's just a guy who was a biblical </v>
<v Speaker 1>scholar and a linguist and he knew a lot</v>

1426
01:02:36.571 --> 01:02:40.980
<v Speaker 1>about ancient languages and he had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very controversial,</v>

1427
01:02:42.420 --> 01:02:44.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1428
01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:48.120
<v Speaker 1>he did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What he did is he went over the Sumerian</v>

1429
01:02:48.121 --> 01:02:53.121
<v Speaker 1>texts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cuneiform clay tablets with the </v>

1430
01:02:53.121 --> 01:02:55.440
<v Speaker 1>weird lines and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what he came up with.</v>

1431
01:02:55.530 --> 01:03:00.530
<v Speaker 1>And really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like the only one out of all the </v>

1432
01:03:00.530 --> 01:03:03.381
<v Speaker 1>other Sumerian scholars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He believes that the Annunaki which are </v>

1433
01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:07.380
<v Speaker 1>descriptive depicted in these ancient </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sumerian texts.</v>

1434
01:03:07.620 --> 01:03:12.620
<v Speaker 1>He believe it was an ancient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He believed it was an ancient </v>

1435
01:03:12.620 --> 01:03:15.090
<v Speaker 1>civilization of aliens that came down </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

1436
01:03:15.091 --> 01:03:17.550
<v Speaker 1>And their planet is in an elliptical </v>
<v Speaker 1>orbit.</v>

1437
01:03:17.780 --> 01:03:21.810
<v Speaker 1>The travels between Mars and Jupiter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1438
01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:26.840
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which they now think is they now think </v>

1439
01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:26.840
<v Speaker 1>there is a planet out there and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know out.</v>

1440
01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:27.390
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1441
01:03:27.391 --> 01:03:30.110
<v Speaker 1>They don't necessarily think it's a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>bureau,</v>

1442
01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:32.790
<v Speaker 1>which is what he called it and what they</v>
<v Speaker 1>called it in the text,</v>

1443
01:03:32.970 --> 01:03:33.840
<v Speaker 1>but his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

1444
01:03:33.841 --> 01:03:36.720
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deciphering of the Sumerian Texas,</v>

1445
01:03:36.750 --> 01:03:41.750
<v Speaker 1>hugely controversial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a website actually called </v>

1446
01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:42.620
<v Speaker 1>Sitchin is wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you go to in Israel,</v>

1447
01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:45.960
<v Speaker 1>I think it's dot com might be.org,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you go to switch and is wrong,</v>

1448
01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:50.010
<v Speaker 1>they sort of highlight all the errors </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they believe he made,</v>

1449
01:03:50.011 --> 01:03:55.011
<v Speaker 1>but it's so convoluted like you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be some sort of a scholar to even </v>

1450
01:03:55.011 --> 01:03:59.541
<v Speaker 1>understand the argument and you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand cuneiform that weird writing </v>

1451
01:03:59.541 --> 01:04:01.740
<v Speaker 1>with a little lines and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

1452
01:04:01.741 --> 01:04:03.480
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the ancient clay tablets,</v>

1453
01:04:03.481 --> 01:04:08.481
<v Speaker 1>forget about understanding the language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ancient clay tablets are </v>

1454
01:04:08.481 --> 01:04:08.481
<v Speaker 1>fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they had a,</v>

1455
01:04:08.580 --> 01:04:12.450
<v Speaker 1>an exact description of the solar </v>
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>

1456
01:04:12.451 --> 01:04:17.040
<v Speaker 1>a drawing of all the planets in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>proper order with the proper sizes.</v>

1457
01:04:17.430 --> 01:04:19.710
<v Speaker 1>And this is 6,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>

1458
01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:23.550
<v Speaker 1>including Pluto.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ancient culture is amazing.</v>

1459
01:04:23.551 --> 01:04:28.551
<v Speaker 1>And I think it was probably when I first</v>
<v Speaker 1>started listening to you is the </v>

1460
01:04:28.551 --> 01:04:28.770
<v Speaker 1>interview with Graham Hancock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just such a big fan.</v>

1461
01:04:28.950 --> 01:04:30.930
<v Speaker 1>I've read all his books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>love him to death.</v>

1462
01:04:31.410 --> 01:04:33.570
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I remember reading his books,</v>

1463
01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:35.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back in the day called whatever it was,</v>

1464
01:04:35.370 --> 01:04:37.350
<v Speaker 1>early nineties or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And reading.</v>

1465
01:04:37.351 --> 01:04:38.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anxious.</v>

1466
01:04:38.041 --> 01:04:43.041
<v Speaker 1>And it just made sense to me that there </v>
<v Speaker 1>is lots of ancient civilizations going </v>

1467
01:04:43.041 --> 01:04:44.880
<v Speaker 1>way back and the evidence is everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just have to open your eyes a little</v>

1468
01:04:44.881 --> 01:04:46.830
<v Speaker 1>bit to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1469
01:04:46.831 --> 01:04:51.831
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Back then in the nineties it was </v>

1470
01:04:51.831 --> 01:04:51.831
<v Speaker 1>pseudoscience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today it's like,</v>

1471
01:04:51.831 --> 01:04:51.831
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

1472
01:04:51.831 --> 01:04:55.591
<v Speaker 1>of course there's lots of ancient </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilizations and we just need to find </v>

1473
01:04:55.591 --> 01:04:56.370
<v Speaker 1>more and more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think one of the best ones is,</v>

1474
01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:58.440
<v Speaker 1>did you ever hear about in Egypt?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1475
01:04:58.441 --> 01:05:00.130
<v Speaker 1>because they uncover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Lula nature,</v>

1476
01:05:00.150 --> 01:05:04.110
<v Speaker 1>there's so much more they see the new </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff that I sold that two days ago.</v>

1477
01:05:04.310 --> 01:05:04.820
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1478
01:05:04.830 --> 01:05:07.440
<v Speaker 1>not the lightest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They believe they found Nefertiti's tomb</v>

1479
01:05:07.700 --> 01:05:12.700
<v Speaker 1>who they found they found two hidden </v>
<v Speaker 1>tombs in Egypt than they believe they </v>

1480
01:05:14.611 --> 01:05:17.920
<v Speaker 1>might have located where she was buried.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see that Jamie?</v>

1481
01:05:17.921 --> 01:05:18.190
<v Speaker 1>I</v>

1482
01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:21.310
<v Speaker 3>retweeted it like two days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like maybe yesterday.</v>

1483
01:05:21.311 --> 01:05:23.140
<v Speaker 3>I think what I find it in King Tut's </v>
<v Speaker 3>tomb,</v>

1484
01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:28.380
<v Speaker 3>90 percent chance of hidden chambers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think it's an effort tds resting </v>

1485
01:05:28.380 --> 01:05:28.380
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>

1486
01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:33.640
<v Speaker 2>Fucking quarter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was getting at is that this </v>

1487
01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:34.470
<v Speaker 2>researcher,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she took the data from satellites,</v>

1488
01:05:34.471 --> 01:05:35.910
<v Speaker 2>ground penetrating radar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1489
01:05:35.911 --> 01:05:36.800
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1490
01:05:36.870 --> 01:05:41.870
<v Speaker 2>Do you see that documentary?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fascinating and they're just shows that </v>

1491
01:05:41.870 --> 01:05:41.870
<v Speaker 2>the whole of Egypt was just covered in </v>
<v Speaker 2>these terms underground.</v>

1492
01:05:41.870 --> 01:05:46.840
<v Speaker 2>They're everywhere and there's so much </v>
<v Speaker 2>more information and the more research </v>

1493
01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:51.021
<v Speaker 2>we do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to find out as ancient </v>

1494
01:05:51.021 --> 01:05:51.021
<v Speaker 2>civilizations going way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way back.</v>

1495
01:05:51.021 --> 01:05:51.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1496
01:05:51.661 --> 01:05:52.790
<v Speaker 2>Egypt very well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never been,</v>

1497
01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:54.600
<v Speaker 2>but in Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the Kimberley,</v>

1498
01:05:54.870 --> 01:05:59.870
<v Speaker 2>there's this two types of artwork.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then there's this one which is from the </v>

1499
01:06:00.031 --> 01:06:02.960
<v Speaker 2>aboriginal people that live there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been going on for a couple thousand</v>

1500
01:06:02.970 --> 01:06:07.970
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then there's this other artwork called </v>

1501
01:06:07.970 --> 01:06:10.110
<v Speaker 2>the bradshaw or going on going on and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>know it's over 30,000</v>

1502
01:06:10.111 --> 01:06:11.980
<v Speaker 2>years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but really it could be a lot,</v>

1503
01:06:11.981 --> 01:06:16.981
<v Speaker 2>lot further,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's from a group of people who were </v>

1504
01:06:16.981 --> 01:06:19.011
<v Speaker 2>in Australia before the aboriginal and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you look at some of these pitches and </v>

1505
01:06:19.501 --> 01:06:24.501
<v Speaker 2>they're amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>amazingly intricate and you can't even </v>

1506
01:06:24.501 --> 01:06:24.501
<v Speaker 2>see the joker anymore.</v>

1507
01:06:24.501 --> 01:06:28.160
<v Speaker 2>There's no paint anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just the shadow of where the paint </v>

1508
01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:30.921
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what you're actually viewing </v>

1509
01:06:30.921 --> 01:06:30.921
<v Speaker 2>because it's so old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they can't actually carbon date it.</v>

1510
01:06:30.921 --> 01:06:35.781
<v Speaker 2>They just look at say a wasp nest grows </v>
<v Speaker 2>on top of it and then the carbon date </v>

1511
01:06:35.781 --> 01:06:35.781
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they go,</v>

1512
01:06:35.781 --> 01:06:39.411
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it's older than the wasp nest and </v>

1513
01:06:39.411 --> 01:06:39.750
<v Speaker 2>so we're talking around about 30,000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably a bit more,</v>

1514
01:06:40.290 --> 01:06:42.140
<v Speaker 2>but some of his artwork is crazy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've.</v>

1515
01:06:42.230 --> 01:06:45.510
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen it personally but there </v>
<v Speaker 2>is one out there drawing which basically</v>

1516
01:06:45.511 --> 01:06:47.390
<v Speaker 2>has pictures of these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1517
01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:52.670
<v Speaker 2>the people who have to go and go and </v>
<v Speaker 2>brad short people these long really </v>

1518
01:06:52.670 --> 01:06:56.800
<v Speaker 2>skinny long sort of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's one with a Ufo in it as well and</v>

1519
01:06:56.820 --> 01:07:01.820
<v Speaker 2>intricate drawings of all the animals </v>
<v Speaker 2>that were there and it's fascinating </v>

1520
01:07:01.820 --> 01:07:05.271
<v Speaker 2>stuff and once again one guy did a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of research and he,</v>

1521
01:07:06.330 --> 01:07:11.330
<v Speaker 2>a lot of his research still hasn't been </v>
<v Speaker 2>released of where it all is and what's </v>

1522
01:07:11.330 --> 01:07:14.781
<v Speaker 2>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is literally everywhere you walk </v>

1523
01:07:14.781 --> 01:07:14.781
<v Speaker 2>up there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this ancient,</v>

1524
01:07:14.781 --> 01:07:18.260
<v Speaker 2>ancient our.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy and it's from a culture that </v>

1525
01:07:18.260 --> 01:07:18.260
<v Speaker 2>is very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very old.</v>

1526
01:07:18.420 --> 01:07:20.910
<v Speaker 2>Probably 30 to 50,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion.</v>

1527
01:07:20.970 --> 01:07:23.820
<v Speaker 2>The data suggest over over 25,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>

1528
01:07:23.970 --> 01:07:28.970
<v Speaker 3>That's so fascinating to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just when you were talking about going </v>

1529
01:07:28.970 --> 01:07:32.031
<v Speaker 3>through those canyons and it's one point</v>
<v Speaker 3>8 billion years old that the amount of </v>

1530
01:07:33.270 --> 01:07:38.270
<v Speaker 3>time this sort of impossible to grasp </v>
<v Speaker 3>distance in time,</v>

1531
01:07:40.490 --> 01:07:42.360
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's we in our mind,</v>

1532
01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:44.790
<v Speaker 3>we just can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just we just can't.</v>

1533
01:07:45.270 --> 01:07:50.270
<v Speaker 3>And so that when you think about that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like this insurmountable amount of time </v>

1534
01:07:51.420 --> 01:07:54.660
<v Speaker 3>and then think about like just 30,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>

1535
01:07:54.661 --> 01:07:58.050
<v Speaker 3>which is still insurmountable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we think of about $30,000</v>

1536
01:07:58.051 --> 01:08:00.720
<v Speaker 3>in comparison to one point 8 billion not</v>
<v Speaker 3>that long ago,</v>

1537
01:08:00.721 --> 01:08:01.860
<v Speaker 3>but it's impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

1538
01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:05.520
<v Speaker 3>your mind is not going to get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a number.</v>

1539
01:08:05.521 --> 01:08:08.820
<v Speaker 3>It's like I have $30,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

1540
01:08:08.821 --> 01:08:10.920
<v Speaker 3>You understand?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You make $30,000,</v>

1541
01:08:10.921 --> 01:08:13.590
<v Speaker 3>you understand $30,000,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't understand 30,000</v>

1542
01:08:13.591 --> 01:08:15.950
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just not to get in there.</v>

1543
01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:18.930
<v Speaker 1>At least my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my comprehension for you,</v>

1544
01:08:19.030 --> 01:08:24.030
<v Speaker 1>you just can't even comprehend it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the Graham Hancock stuff combined </v>

1545
01:08:24.030 --> 01:08:28.181
<v Speaker 1>with the Randall Carlson stuff is to me </v>
<v Speaker 1>where it all sort of comes together </v>

1546
01:08:28.181 --> 01:08:29.570
<v Speaker 1>because Randall Carlson offers an </v>
<v Speaker 1>explanation for these.</v>

1547
01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:34.610
<v Speaker 1>These civilizations being so advanced </v>
<v Speaker 1>but yet all essentially wiped out,</v>

1548
01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:40.000
<v Speaker 1>just rising sea levels can explain that </v>
<v Speaker 1>so many people don't know that the sea </v>

1549
01:08:40.791 --> 01:08:43.580
<v Speaker 1>level was about 150 meters lower than it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is today.</v>

1550
01:08:44.110 --> 01:08:45.890
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so all these civilizations,</v>

1551
01:08:45.891 --> 01:08:48.320
<v Speaker 1>civilizations are always put on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>coast,</v>

1552
01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:53.880
<v Speaker 1>so you're right on the coast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Massive amount of people and suddenly a </v>

1553
01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:56.201
<v Speaker 1>hundred and 50 meters of waters there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is so much that we still discover </v>

1554
01:08:56.720 --> 01:09:01.720
<v Speaker 1>on our coast in 150 meters of water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There will be lots and lots of evidence </v>

1555
01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:05.501
<v Speaker 1>down there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it gets covered in silt within a </v>

1556
01:09:05.501 --> 01:09:06.020
<v Speaker 1>thousand years and it's hard to find </v>
<v Speaker 1>someday they're going to find Miami.</v>

1557
01:09:06.860 --> 01:09:08.020
<v Speaker 1>They're going to find my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go,</v>

1558
01:09:08.030 --> 01:09:10.330
<v Speaker 1>what the hell happened here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ,</v>

1559
01:09:10.331 --> 01:09:15.331
<v Speaker 1>just bags of coke and fake tits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just going to find like </v>

1560
01:09:15.331 --> 01:09:19.210
<v Speaker 1>stilettos Ferrari's under water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked that as a thought experiment of </v>

1561
01:09:19.550 --> 01:09:23.090
<v Speaker 1>go forward 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years and be a geologist looking back at</v>

1562
01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:26.330
<v Speaker 1>our little timeframe here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the anthropocene or whatever you want to</v>

1563
01:09:26.331 --> 01:09:31.331
<v Speaker 1>call them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where humans have been impacting the </v>

1564
01:09:31.331 --> 01:09:31.360
<v Speaker 1>planet like that layer of rock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you going to find in it?</v>

1565
01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:33.200
<v Speaker 1>I found that interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think is going to be there?</v>

1566
01:09:33.470 --> 01:09:35.120
<v Speaker 1>They're going to find those kettlebells </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind you.</v>

1567
01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:40.240
<v Speaker 1>The Werewolf one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to fuck with these people </v>

1568
01:09:40.240 --> 01:09:40.240
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to find,</v>

1569
01:09:40.240 --> 01:09:41.450
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to find only stone.</v>

1570
01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:42.260
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially.</v>

1571
01:09:42.261 --> 01:09:43.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you ever seen that?</v>

1572
01:09:43.221 --> 01:09:44.390
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1573
01:09:44.391 --> 01:09:49.391
<v Speaker 1>there was a documentary that they did </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they showed what would happen </v>

1574
01:09:49.391 --> 01:09:50.870
<v Speaker 1>within a thousand years if we just </v>
<v Speaker 1>abandoned cities.</v>

1575
01:09:50.930 --> 01:09:55.930
<v Speaker 1>Like what would happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How could you have to take into </v>

1576
01:09:55.930 --> 01:09:55.930
<v Speaker 1>documentary series?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was it.</v>

1577
01:09:55.930 --> 01:09:55.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazing,</v>

1578
01:09:55.930 --> 01:09:55.930
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1579
01:09:55.930 --> 01:10:00.700
<v Speaker 1>Well there's some photos of Detroit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting how nature is </v>

1580
01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:05.051
<v Speaker 1>taking over buildings in Detroit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like trees are growing through the </v>

1581
01:10:05.051 --> 01:10:07.460
<v Speaker 1>center of houses and it's just only </v>
<v Speaker 1>within a few decades,</v>

1582
01:10:07.910 --> 01:10:12.910
<v Speaker 1>the main source of erosion in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>kimberleys and stuff like that is </v>

1583
01:10:12.910 --> 01:10:12.910
<v Speaker 1>plants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so in the,</v>

1584
01:10:13.290 --> 01:10:15.530
<v Speaker 1>in the dry season,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they grow into the cracks and stuff.</v>

1585
01:10:15.531 --> 01:10:16.970
<v Speaker 1>That routes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then in the wet season,</v>

1586
01:10:16.980 --> 01:10:20.410
<v Speaker 1>they resemble this water and their route</v>
<v Speaker 1>swell and exerts a pressure about,</v>

1587
01:10:20.420 --> 01:10:24.020
<v Speaker 1>I think that 3000 psi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just literally just cracks it.</v>

1588
01:10:24.021 --> 01:10:27.050
<v Speaker 1>And that happens to concrete if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not constantly pulling that,</v>

1589
01:10:27.051 --> 01:10:29.990
<v Speaker 1>all those grass seeds and making sure </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff isn't growing around concrete,</v>

1590
01:10:30.260 --> 01:10:35.260
<v Speaker 1>all our infrastructure will be crumbled </v>
<v Speaker 1>and very little left just by plants are </v>

1591
01:10:35.260 --> 01:10:36.000
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1592
01:10:36.230 --> 01:10:37.640
<v Speaker 1>I pulled the wire and pull it.</v>

1593
01:10:37.910 --> 01:10:41.810
<v Speaker 1>I had a problem my toilet and put this </v>
<v Speaker 1>on Instagram,</v>

1594
01:10:41.870 --> 01:10:43.640
<v Speaker 1>find that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that toilet monster.</v>

1595
01:10:44.030 --> 01:10:44.610
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1596
01:10:44.670 --> 01:10:49.070
<v Speaker 1>I had the guy come over the plumber guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and just doesn't flush.</v>

1597
01:10:49.071 --> 01:10:53.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he was like a snake that has a camera</v>

1598
01:10:53.931 --> 01:10:58.160
<v Speaker 1>on it and they find that there was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>crack in the pipe and the roots had gone</v>

1599
01:10:58.161 --> 01:11:03.161
<v Speaker 1>through the small crack in the pipe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gotten inside the toilet pipe and filled</v>

1600
01:11:04.310 --> 01:11:08.690
<v Speaker 1>the entire pipe with a root system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it looked like an animal.</v>

1601
01:11:08.900 --> 01:11:12.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean we're talking about something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was like four plus feet long.</v>

1602
01:11:12.140 --> 01:11:14.250
<v Speaker 1>Enormous look it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leave that up there.</v>

1603
01:11:15.620 --> 01:11:19.410
<v Speaker 1>They pulled that out of my toilet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it's saying,</v>

1604
01:11:19.740 --> 01:11:21.300
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but does it surprise me?</v>

1605
01:11:21.570 --> 01:11:24.270
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't surprise me there now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but back then I was like,</v>

1606
01:11:24.271 --> 01:11:26.970
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will be.</v>

1607
01:11:26.971 --> 01:11:28.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean that life after people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you watch that thing,</v>

1608
01:11:28.860 --> 01:11:32.880
<v Speaker 1>they get to 100 years and you barely </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognize the city 100 years later.</v>

1609
01:11:32.950 --> 01:11:33.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some plans.</v>

1610
01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:36.970
<v Speaker 1>There's some cool photos of in Detroit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that photo of this.</v>

1611
01:11:37.260 --> 01:11:40.230
<v Speaker 1>These houses that are just being taken </v>
<v Speaker 1>over by trees.</v>

1612
01:11:40.231 --> 01:11:44.460
<v Speaker 1>That's the center of a house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just trees grow in the middle of it.</v>

1613
01:11:44.461 --> 01:11:47.850
<v Speaker 1>They burst through the foundation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they break through the bottom floors.</v>

1614
01:11:47.851 --> 01:11:49.710
<v Speaker 1>They go through the ceiling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they fill up.</v>

1615
01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:50.700
<v Speaker 1>Look at that house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1616
01:11:51.210 --> 01:11:56.210
<v Speaker 1>Well this is something that we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about before we started the </v>

1617
01:11:56.210 --> 01:11:59.151
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were talking about being in Costa </v>

1618
01:11:59.151 --> 01:11:59.860
<v Speaker 1>Rica and these people see what you would</v>
<v Speaker 1>call like Phantom Pyramids.</v>

1619
01:11:59.990 --> 01:12:01.880
<v Speaker 1>They think people always want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They.</v>

1620
01:12:02.490 --> 01:12:05.460
<v Speaker 1>It's very beneficial to find ancient </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>

1621
01:12:05.461 --> 01:12:10.461
<v Speaker 1>So there's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a few ancient structures </v>

1622
01:12:10.461 --> 01:12:12.741
<v Speaker 1>throughout the world that are extremely </v>
<v Speaker 1>controversial because people look at </v>

1623
01:12:12.741 --> 01:12:12.741
<v Speaker 1>them and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then another say yard.</v>

1624
01:12:12.741 --> 01:12:13.140
<v Speaker 1>Dang.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like A.</v>

1625
01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:18.440
<v Speaker 1>Essentially it's a structure that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>just a natural structure that you're </v>

1626
01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:19.530
<v Speaker 1>trying to attribute to a civilization.</v>

1627
01:12:20.310 --> 01:12:25.310
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's enough ancient structures out </v>

1628
01:12:25.310 --> 01:12:25.310
<v Speaker 1>there to be amazed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's just put that forth.</v>

1629
01:12:25.310 --> 01:12:26.190
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't need to find hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1630
01:12:26.191 --> 01:12:28.890
<v Speaker 1>The the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 20 or 30 that we have is amazing.</v>

1631
01:12:28.950 --> 01:12:30.600
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we like finding them in our yard.</v>

1632
01:12:30.990 --> 01:12:35.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a cheer Polo if you ever heard of </v>

1633
01:12:35.990 --> 01:12:35.990
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where I went.</v>

1634
01:12:35.990 --> 01:12:40.581
<v Speaker 1>And Costa Rica.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was visiting my cousin down there and </v>

1635
01:12:40.581 --> 01:12:42.910
<v Speaker 1>a vibe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just got to put that out there.</v>

1636
01:12:42.940 --> 01:12:44.680
<v Speaker 1>Like when you're up in the mountains </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1637
01:12:44.681 --> 01:12:49.681
<v Speaker 1>I had a little Sabina on the top of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridge looking over this massive valley </v>

1638
01:12:49.681 --> 01:12:53.750
<v Speaker 1>and the vibe and the like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just phenomenal because the </v>

1639
01:12:53.750 --> 01:12:56.991
<v Speaker 1>indigenous people there are still </v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively in touch with the natural </v>

1640
01:12:56.991 --> 01:12:59.280
<v Speaker 1>environment and there's large areas here</v>
<v Speaker 1>with me as a gringo.</v>

1641
01:12:59.281 --> 01:13:01.350
<v Speaker 1>I can't go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't go anywhere near it.</v>

1642
01:13:01.410 --> 01:13:06.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm only the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The indigenous people there and people </v>

1643
01:13:06.410 --> 01:13:06.960
<v Speaker 1>look at satellite maps and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1644
01:13:06.961 --> 01:13:09.030
<v Speaker 1>this is one massive pyramid.</v>

1645
01:13:09.030 --> 01:13:13.540
<v Speaker 1>The largest pyramid in the world could </v>
<v Speaker 1>also just be a mountain as well.</v>

1646
01:13:13.541 --> 01:13:15.880
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm all about evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Show me the evidence and um,</v>

1647
01:13:16.010 --> 01:13:17.710
<v Speaker 1>I've got an open mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy I do.</v>

1648
01:13:17.740 --> 01:13:20.400
<v Speaker 1>They think it's the largest pyramid </v>
<v Speaker 1>normal just by.</v>

1649
01:13:20.401 --> 01:13:22.250
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the satellite data and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then draw it out,</v>

1650
01:13:22.300 --> 01:13:23.730
<v Speaker 1>it would be the largest pyramid in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

1651
01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:28.760
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what makes them think that it's a </v>

1652
01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:29.070
<v Speaker 1>pyramid shape and stuff like that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1653
01:13:29.190 --> 01:13:31.230
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it right there.</v>

1654
01:13:31.860 --> 01:13:36.860
<v Speaker 1>That's a fucking mountain bitch you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of here.</v>

1655
01:13:38.341 --> 01:13:40.650
<v Speaker 1>So that's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1656
01:13:40.651 --> 01:13:45.651
<v Speaker 1>there's actually a dance where I live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a place called Walters pyramid </v>

1657
01:13:45.651 --> 01:13:47.940
<v Speaker 1>and there is actually this Little Hill </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mountain,</v>

1658
01:13:47.941 --> 01:13:50.280
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want that's in the shape of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a pyramid perfectly.</v>

1659
01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:53.610
<v Speaker 1>And this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in Cannes called Walsh's pyramid.</v>

1660
01:13:54.270 --> 01:13:58.770
<v Speaker 1>People run up and down it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a big fitness thing for it's,</v>

1661
01:13:59.010 --> 01:14:00.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's pretty much a pyramid,</v>

1662
01:14:00.691 --> 01:14:03.150
<v Speaker 1>but it's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a natural formation.</v>

1663
01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:06.900
<v Speaker 1>So it's not a pyramid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that mountain is a mountain.</v>

1664
01:14:07.830 --> 01:14:10.170
<v Speaker 1>It's like saying the earth is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>biggest soccer ball in the world.</v>

1665
01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:11.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it kind of is.</v>

1666
01:14:12.700 --> 01:14:13.720
<v Speaker 2>If we were big enough to kick it.</v>

1667
01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:14.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

1668
01:14:15.060 --> 01:14:15.690
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

1669
01:14:15.730 --> 01:14:18.240
<v Speaker 3>it's the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We found a huge ball.</v>

1670
01:14:18.950 --> 01:14:21.430
<v Speaker 3>It's 24,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>miles in a circle and you're standing on</v>

1671
01:14:21.431 --> 01:14:21.520
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1672
01:14:22.340 --> 01:14:24.560
<v Speaker 2>As I said before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the show to Costa Rica.</v>

1673
01:14:24.561 --> 01:14:26.360
<v Speaker 2>This is so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People down there.</v>

1674
01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:27.430
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got an open mind.</v>

1675
01:14:27.460 --> 01:14:28.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm willing to listen to people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

1676
01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:30.440
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>show me the evidence.</v>

1677
01:14:30.650 --> 01:14:33.050
<v Speaker 2>There's a way that you can get</v>

1678
01:14:33.380 --> 01:14:38.380
<v Speaker 3>when you party too much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where your grasp on reality is like </v>

1679
01:14:38.380 --> 01:14:42.431
<v Speaker 3>holding onto a dolphin with olive oil on</v>
<v Speaker 3>your hands and you just,</v>

1680
01:14:43.370 --> 01:14:48.350
<v Speaker 3>you just can't quite grasp it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I've met a lot of people like that.</v>

1681
01:14:48.380 --> 01:14:53.380
<v Speaker 3>All,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of people like that because of my </v>

1682
01:14:53.380 --> 01:14:54.290
<v Speaker 3>reputation within a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1683
01:14:54.410 --> 01:14:59.410
<v Speaker 3>quote unquote psychedelic community and </v>
<v Speaker 3>my connections to marijuana on </v>

1684
01:14:59.410 --> 01:15:03.851
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic drugs and all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've met so many I've met before I go </v>

1685
01:15:03.951 --> 01:15:05.690
<v Speaker 3>negative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing people.</v>

1686
01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:10.720
<v Speaker 3>I've met some really fascinating </v>
<v Speaker 3>openminded people that have Dennis </v>

1687
01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:12.620
<v Speaker 3>Mckenna,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Lorenzo haggerty.</v>

1688
01:15:12.621 --> 01:15:15.860
<v Speaker 3>I met some amazing people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've also met some,</v>

1689
01:15:16.340 --> 01:15:21.340
<v Speaker 3>like some people that they've lost their</v>
<v Speaker 3>ability to discern what might be </v>

1690
01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:27.520
<v Speaker 3>possible versus what you're adding to </v>
<v Speaker 3>all this stuff to make it more fantastic</v>

1691
01:15:29.031 --> 01:15:29.960
<v Speaker 3>than it really is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1692
01:15:29.990 --> 01:15:31.300
<v Speaker 3>and by doing so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

1693
01:15:31.490 --> 01:15:36.490
<v Speaker 3>you've entered into this sort of fantasy</v>
<v Speaker 3>land and you've sort of negated all </v>

1694
01:15:36.490 --> 01:15:37.990
<v Speaker 3>potential realistic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1695
01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:38.990
<v Speaker 3>interpretations of.</v>

1696
01:15:39.140 --> 01:15:40.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I meet people at that,</v>

1697
01:15:40.431 --> 01:15:43.910
<v Speaker 2>and I do too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always push them towards them saying,</v>

1698
01:15:43.911 --> 01:15:45.320
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you've read these books now,</v>

1699
01:15:45.620 --> 01:15:49.820
<v Speaker 2>now going to read a physics textbook and</v>
<v Speaker 2>just get all your information.</v>

1700
01:15:49.821 --> 01:15:51.190
<v Speaker 2>Then make your own opinions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your opinion.</v>

1701
01:15:51.230 --> 01:15:56.230
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're dealing with more high level </v>

1702
01:15:56.230 --> 01:15:56.230
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're dealing with book readers.</v>

1703
01:15:56.230 --> 01:15:57.950
<v Speaker 3>I'm dealing with youtube watchers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1704
01:15:57.951 --> 01:16:01.940
<v Speaker 3>I am really lucky to new into a youtube </v>
<v Speaker 3>video about reptilians.</v>

1705
01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:04.460
<v Speaker 3>Don't be so quick to dismiss them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>brother.</v>

1706
01:16:04.510 --> 01:16:05.140
<v Speaker 3>There are amongst.</v>

1707
01:16:05.350 --> 01:16:10.350
<v Speaker 2>So I'm very lucky that in my job and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>guess the brand national geographic as </v>

1708
01:16:10.350 --> 01:16:14.051
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it brings in people who are progressive </v>

1709
01:16:14.051 --> 01:16:14.780
<v Speaker 2>nature lovers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chimney rather intelligent.</v>

1710
01:16:14.781 --> 01:16:17.300
<v Speaker 2>I have dinner with these people and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's probably the biggest perks for me</v>

1711
01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:22.480
<v Speaker 2>is you meet people who are just </v>
<v Speaker 2>fascinating because they always attack </v>

1712
01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:26.771
<v Speaker 2>you with questions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you spend half the meal just </v>

1713
01:16:26.771 --> 01:16:26.771
<v Speaker 2>answering questions like we're doing now</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of thing,</v>

1714
01:16:26.771 --> 01:16:28.880
<v Speaker 2>and then then eventually turn around and</v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

1715
01:16:28.940 --> 01:16:29.660
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you do?</v>

1716
01:16:30.050 --> 01:16:33.620
<v Speaker 2>And generally the graduates of Harvard </v>
<v Speaker 2>or mit and it's like,</v>

1717
01:16:33.621 --> 01:16:34.310
<v Speaker 2>what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1718
01:16:34.730 --> 01:16:39.730
<v Speaker 2>on the International Space Station,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the little box that spins the solar </v>

1719
01:16:39.730 --> 01:16:39.730
<v Speaker 2>panels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I invented that,</v>

1720
01:16:39.730 --> 01:16:41.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even some.</v>

1721
01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:44.250
<v Speaker 2>I met a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was the older George Bush,</v>

1722
01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:45.490
<v Speaker 2>George H,</v>
<v Speaker 2>w Bush,</v>

1723
01:16:45.491 --> 01:16:48.140
<v Speaker 2>his lawyer had some very pertinent </v>
<v Speaker 2>questions for him.</v>

1724
01:16:48.830 --> 01:16:53.830
<v Speaker 2>You just meet some really interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are kind of unknown I </v>

1725
01:16:54.411 --> 01:16:59.411
<v Speaker 2>suppose to a certain degree and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>hearing their opinions and their life </v>

1726
01:16:59.411 --> 01:17:00.110
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fascinating.</v>

1727
01:17:00.350 --> 01:17:01.520
<v Speaker 2>People are fascinating.</v>

1728
01:17:01.850 --> 01:17:04.550
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems like being involved in national</v>

1729
01:17:04.551 --> 01:17:09.470
<v Speaker 3>geographic would make kind of like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>magnet for curiosity in the creek.</v>

1730
01:17:09.471 --> 01:17:10.190
<v Speaker 3>Curious people</v>

1731
01:17:10.190 --> 01:17:11.300
<v Speaker 1>just come to you and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

1732
01:17:11.510 --> 01:17:13.280
<v Speaker 1>that's as soon as you messaged me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1733
01:17:13.310 --> 01:17:16.670
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this fucking guy's seen some shit.</v>

1734
01:17:17.240 --> 01:17:18.980
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1735
01:17:18.981 --> 01:17:23.981
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've worked on other ships that don't </v>

1736
01:17:23.981 --> 01:17:26.621
<v Speaker 1>have the national geographic brand and </v>
<v Speaker 1>yet you still get 50 percent really </v>

1737
01:17:26.621 --> 01:17:26.630
<v Speaker 1>cool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting people,</v>

1738
01:17:26.631 --> 01:17:31.631
<v Speaker 1>but then you get a group of people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>also aren't that interested in what's </v>

1739
01:17:31.631 --> 01:17:35.021
<v Speaker 1>going on and that's kind of a selling </v>
<v Speaker 1>point is that we have all these experts </v>

1740
01:17:35.021 --> 01:17:35.021
<v Speaker 1>on there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1741
01:17:35.021 --> 01:17:37.070
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't go so far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called myself an expert,</v>

1742
01:17:37.071 --> 01:17:42.071
<v Speaker 1>but like we went to Easter island a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple months ago and we had the world </v>

1743
01:17:42.071 --> 01:17:43.520
<v Speaker 1>expert on Easter island on board the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ship.</v>

1744

<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the guy that was living next </v>

1745
01:17:48.730 --> 01:17:48.730
<v Speaker 1>door to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the guy from your instagram page.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Last name.</v>

1749
01:17:52.610 --> 01:17:53.870
<v Speaker 1>How do you pronounce it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie?</v>

1750
01:17:54.700 --> 01:17:58.420
<v Speaker 1>Christiana crop on instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1751
01:17:58.490 --> 01:17:59.450
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1752
01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:04.520
<v Speaker 1>the photos of Easter island to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am absolutely blown away by Easter </v>

1753
01:18:05.060 --> 01:18:08.860
<v Speaker 1>Island and perplexed and fascinated and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I always try to understand.</v>

1754
01:18:08.861 --> 01:18:13.861
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would someone spend so much time to </v>

1755
01:18:13.861 --> 01:18:14.650
<v Speaker 1>make these statues and where are they </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting these stones from and like.</v>

1756
01:18:14.930 --> 01:18:15.920
<v Speaker 1>And they go deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deep,</v>

1757
01:18:15.921 --> 01:18:18.830
<v Speaker 1>deep into the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you go deeper into the ground,</v>

1758
01:18:18.831 --> 01:18:23.831
<v Speaker 1>you see that it's not just a head and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole body and a full figure </v>

1759
01:18:23.831 --> 01:18:23.831
<v Speaker 1>down there.</v>

1760
01:18:26.270 --> 01:18:30.260
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean or is that fake?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all those pictures where they dug</v>

1761
01:18:30.261 --> 01:18:32.000
<v Speaker 1>into the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see like this,</v>

1762
01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:34.190
<v Speaker 1>this shoulders and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not.</v>

1763
01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:40.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose you could say that some of </v>

1764
01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:40.480
<v Speaker 1>them do have bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1765
01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:42.941
<v Speaker 1>but most of the ones you see the most of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them are like that just to show most of </v>

1766
01:18:43.011 --> 01:18:44.030
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's what you see.</v>

1767
01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:49.240
<v Speaker 1>But under the ground isn't there more?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is obviously a victim of </v>

1768
01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:49.240
<v Speaker 1>erosion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1769
01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:52.380
<v Speaker 1>These things have been eroded by time </v>
<v Speaker 1>and wind and sand.</v>

1770
01:18:52.381 --> 01:18:54.650
<v Speaker 1>These ones actually they couldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 1>bothered moving them.</v>

1771
01:18:54.710 --> 01:18:55.670
<v Speaker 1>These are right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The quarry,</v>

1772
01:18:55.671 --> 01:18:57.770
<v Speaker 1>this is where they've cut them out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the side of the mountain.</v>

1773
01:18:57.870 --> 01:19:02.290
<v Speaker 1>This group right here and so and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>they haven't been bothered or whatever's</v>

1774
01:19:02.330 --> 01:19:03.530
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Haven't been bothered to move.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Easter island where they dig.</v>

1784
01:19:27.310 --> 01:19:32.310
<v Speaker 1>There's some expeditions that they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>done where they've dug out around the </v>

1785
01:19:32.310 --> 01:19:34.250
<v Speaker 1>statues and dug deep down and you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>see arms.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's more than just ahead.</v>

1793
01:19:46.581 --> 01:19:51.581

1794
01:19:51.581 --> 01:19:53.780

<v Speaker 1>One of the upper left Jamie with heads </v>

1802
01:20:10.330 --> 01:20:10.330
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the hell is that?</v>

1805
01:20:10.330 --> 01:20:10.330
<v Speaker 2>That's fake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1806
01:20:10.330 --> 01:20:10.510
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1807
01:20:10.820 --> 01:20:12.120
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Feel like yoga.</v>

1808
01:20:12.210 --> 01:20:13.680
<v Speaker 2>Don't get me wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first question,</v>

1809
01:20:13.681 --> 01:20:14.850
<v Speaker 2>when I got there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first question,</v>

1810
01:20:14.851 --> 01:20:18.000
<v Speaker 2>I was like bodies underneath and first </v>
<v Speaker 2>question,</v>

1811
01:20:18.270 --> 01:20:20.490
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they to help because they didn't want to</v>

1812
01:20:20.491 --> 01:20:25.230
<v Speaker 2>dig crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gringos sorts of politics always,</v>

1813
01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:28.320
<v Speaker 2>always with anything like this is their </v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy politics.</v>

1814
01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:33.440
<v Speaker 2>Is it hard when you go to these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these communities because you want to </v>

1815
01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:37.730
<v Speaker 2>respect their cultures and their way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you also want to kind of get to the </v>

1816
01:20:37.730 --> 01:20:39.840
<v Speaker 2>bottom of these things as much as you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can in a brief amount of time.</v>

1817
01:20:40.260 --> 01:20:42.480
<v Speaker 2>I suppose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do I attack that one?</v>

1818
01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:43.080
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1819
01:20:43.260 --> 01:20:44.820
<v Speaker 2>I suppose when you get the expert on </v>
<v Speaker 2>board,</v>

1820
01:20:44.870 --> 01:20:46.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you get to hear about all these</v>

1821
01:20:46.861 --> 01:20:51.861
<v Speaker 2>sort of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I guess most people going through </v>

1822
01:20:51.861 --> 01:20:53.751
<v Speaker 2>here wouldn't hear half the stuff that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we learn about because you don't have </v>

1823
01:20:53.751 --> 01:20:53.910
<v Speaker 2>that world experts sitting there.</v>

1824
01:20:54.150 --> 01:20:56.670
<v Speaker 2>You've got just some random two guide or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

1825
01:20:57.270 --> 01:21:02.270
<v Speaker 2>So there's a lot to it and I know with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Claudio he had epic battles with the </v>

1826
01:21:02.270 --> 01:21:02.990
<v Speaker 2>alternate because he just wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>restore,</v>

1827
01:21:02.991 --> 01:21:07.991
<v Speaker 2>it was just a big pile of them piled up </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he wanted to come in here with a </v>

1828
01:21:07.991 --> 01:21:08.530
<v Speaker 2>crane and put them all back to how they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were and yeah,</v>

1829
01:21:08.550 --> 01:21:12.600
<v Speaker 2>the amount of flack and backlash and </v>
<v Speaker 2>trouble that he went through over,</v>

1830
01:21:13.110 --> 01:21:14.760
<v Speaker 2>I think it was more than five years to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>

1831
01:21:15.330 --> 01:21:20.330
<v Speaker 2>So unfortunate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that happens in so many of these </v>

1832
01:21:20.330 --> 01:21:20.550
<v Speaker 2>places where they want to sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>preserve the narrative,</v>

1833
01:21:20.610 --> 01:21:22.770
<v Speaker 2>like they have a narrative and they've </v>
<v Speaker 2>been,</v>

1834
01:21:23.500 --> 01:21:27.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>giving these speeches and they have this</v>

1835
01:21:27.061 --> 01:21:32.061
<v Speaker 2>idea of a timeline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how everything was done and when new </v>

1836
01:21:32.061 --> 01:21:32.190
<v Speaker 2>evidence comes along,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

1837
01:21:32.191 --> 01:21:35.370
<v Speaker 2>very reluctant to accept it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You find that a lot in Egypt.</v>

1838
01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:37.770
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's the guy that wrote 20 papers</v>

1839
01:21:37.771 --> 01:21:40.440
<v Speaker 2>about that particular narrative and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've just come over and say,</v>

1840
01:21:40.470 --> 01:21:43.880
<v Speaker 2>oh actually that's all wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or different aspects of it.</v>

1841
01:21:43.881 --> 01:21:48.881
<v Speaker 2>Of course they're gonna bring it up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot of pushback is the coolest </v>

1842
01:21:48.881 --> 01:21:52.640
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I found very interesting about </v>

1843
01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:53.880
<v Speaker 2>Australia was the birdman culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1844
01:21:54.190 --> 01:21:55.110
<v Speaker 2>go into it though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please.</v>

1845
01:21:55.111 --> 01:21:58.020
<v Speaker 2>So you've got this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this culture with statues and stuff,</v>

1846
01:21:58.050 --> 01:22:00.630
<v Speaker 2>and then that culture actually kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>died out,</v>

1847
01:22:00.631 --> 01:22:05.631
<v Speaker 2>but it definitely went out of favor and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then you had the birdman culture come </v>

1848
01:22:05.631 --> 01:22:06.140
<v Speaker 2>into it and that was the last one to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1849
01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:11.480
<v Speaker 2>When you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at Western civilization kind of turned </v>

1850
01:22:11.480 --> 01:22:14.091
<v Speaker 2>up and that was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a competition every year where </v>

1851
01:22:14.091 --> 01:22:16.980
<v Speaker 2>they would all run,</v>
<v Speaker 2>swim out to another island,</v>

1852
01:22:17.010 --> 01:22:22.010
<v Speaker 2>down a steep cliff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holly would die in the process and try </v>

1853
01:22:22.010 --> 01:22:25.611
<v Speaker 2>and get the first egg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically the first egg from the turns </v>

1854
01:22:25.611 --> 01:22:25.680
<v Speaker 2>there and then have to bring it all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way back in.</v>

1855
01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:28.290
<v Speaker 2>The first one back with his egg was then</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1856
01:22:29.460 --> 01:22:33.720
<v Speaker 2>I guess some sort of analogy would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus basically,</v>

1857
01:22:33.721 --> 01:22:37.900
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere he's the God basically and,</v>

1858
01:22:37.910 --> 01:22:39.450
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but his manner,</v>

1859
01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:43.380
<v Speaker 2>his energy was then far too powerful for</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone to have any contact with him.</v>

1860
01:22:43.381 --> 01:22:47.880
<v Speaker 2>So He's as winning his prize was he </v>
<v Speaker 2>would go live in a little hut by himself</v>

1861
01:22:47.881 --> 01:22:50.430
<v Speaker 2>for the rest of the year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't allowed to cut his fingernails</v>

1862
01:22:50.460 --> 01:22:54.660
<v Speaker 2>or hear anything for a year and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>they can come back.</v>

1863
01:22:54.661 --> 01:22:59.661
<v Speaker 2>But his group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his tribe would then be the leaders of </v>

1864
01:22:59.661 --> 01:22:59.880
<v Speaker 2>the island.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1865
01:22:59.881 --> 01:23:02.100
<v Speaker 2>So basically all the different groups </v>
<v Speaker 2>would.</v>

1866
01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:07.400
<v Speaker 2>Every year they're changeover who's in </v>
<v Speaker 2>control and that will keep everyone </v>

1867
01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:10.321
<v Speaker 2>happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there wasn't one particular group </v>

1868
01:23:10.321 --> 01:23:10.321
<v Speaker 2>that was in charge of everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

1869
01:23:10.321 --> 01:23:12.490
<v Speaker 2>it varied based on who won the Birdman </v>
<v Speaker 2>and competition that year,</v>

1870
01:23:13.930 --> 01:23:15.820
<v Speaker 2>how they came up with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea.</v>

1871
01:23:15.910 --> 01:23:20.050
<v Speaker 3>It's so bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so many weird styles of culture,</v>

1872
01:23:20.140 --> 01:23:23.020
<v Speaker 3>like the way people decide to run their </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

1873
01:23:23.260 --> 01:23:24.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So strange.</v>

1874
01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:27.550
<v Speaker 3>Like how the hell does that ever come </v>
<v Speaker 3>about where everyone agrees.</v>

1875
01:23:27.630 --> 01:23:29.020
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the dude who gets the egg,</v>

1876
01:23:29.290 --> 01:23:32.260
<v Speaker 3>you're Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to live by yourself.</v>

1877
01:23:32.650 --> 01:23:37.650
<v Speaker 3>So it's like I don't want to live by </v>
<v Speaker 3>myself and he probably doesn't want to </v>

1878
01:23:37.650 --> 01:23:38.620
<v Speaker 3>live by himself either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like a bittersweet victory.</v>

1879
01:23:38.820 --> 01:23:41.380
<v Speaker 3>A GAM Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But now I can't even cut my fingernails.</v>

1880
01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:43.450
<v Speaker 3>I got to live in a fucking hut by </v>
<v Speaker 3>myself,</v>

1881
01:23:44.260 --> 01:23:47.560
<v Speaker 3>but I'm full of so much manner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1882
01:23:47.590 --> 01:23:52.590
<v Speaker 3>there's so many really uber bizarre </v>
<v Speaker 3>cultural traditions all around the </v>

1883
01:23:52.590 --> 01:23:56.821
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you're aware of the semen </v>

1884
01:23:56.821 --> 01:23:58.140
<v Speaker 3>warriors in New Guinea semen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1885
01:23:58.280 --> 01:24:00.380
<v Speaker 2>Now I've traveled extensively through </v>
<v Speaker 2>puppeting Guinea.</v>

1886
01:24:00.710 --> 01:24:01.630
<v Speaker 2>You'll have to enlighten.</v>

1887
01:24:01.940 --> 01:24:04.220
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's awful.</v>

1888
01:24:04.310 --> 01:24:09.310
<v Speaker 3>It's essentially a culture of child </v>
<v Speaker 3>molestation where they take children </v>

1889
01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:15.040
<v Speaker 3>from the time they're very young and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they moved them away from their mother </v>

1890
01:24:15.411 --> 01:24:20.411
<v Speaker 3>and they move into these bachelor groups</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they have these older men and these </v>

1891
01:24:20.691 --> 01:24:25.370
<v Speaker 3>younger boys and they essentially tell </v>
<v Speaker 3>these younger boys that the only way for</v>

1892
01:24:25.371 --> 01:24:30.371
<v Speaker 3>them to grow up and be strong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we're talking about a culture that </v>

1893
01:24:30.371 --> 01:24:33.020
<v Speaker 3>says thousands and thousands of members,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only way for them to grow up and be </v>

1894
01:24:33.020 --> 01:24:36.761
<v Speaker 3>strong is to ingest semen so they have </v>
<v Speaker 3>to ingest it orally and annually and it </v>

1895
01:24:37.161 --> 01:24:41.820
<v Speaker 3>is a an ancient tradition of these semen</v>
<v Speaker 3>warriors in New Guinea and they have.</v>

1896
01:24:42.110 --> 01:24:47.110
<v Speaker 3>They've grown up being molested and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>molesting new children as they come up </v>

1897
01:24:48.530 --> 01:24:52.230
<v Speaker 3>and it's homosexual molestation and </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

1898
01:24:52.570 --> 01:24:53.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's.</v>

1899
01:24:53.060 --> 01:24:58.060
<v Speaker 3>This is documented,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not like something I'll make on </v>

1900
01:24:58.060 --> 01:24:58.060
<v Speaker 3>that</v>

1901
01:24:58.060 --> 01:25:00.240
<v Speaker 2>crazy stuff pumping to Guinea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I spent a lot of time in asthma and </v>

1902
01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:00.240
<v Speaker 2>region,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which actually is in Papa New Guinea,</v>

1903
01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:01.600
<v Speaker 2>Indonesia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's not go there.</v>

1904
01:25:01.650 --> 01:25:04.130
<v Speaker 2>You see anything about that Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1905
01:25:04.190 --> 01:25:07.870
<v Speaker 2>I found something on wikipedia called </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Toro tribe.</v>

1906
01:25:08.350 --> 01:25:13.350
<v Speaker 2>It's really dark man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think it extended their life for </v>

1907
01:25:14.290 --> 01:25:19.290
<v Speaker 2>homosexual sex prolongs life and </v>
<v Speaker 2>heterosexual relationships are focused </v>

1908
01:25:19.290 --> 01:25:19.690
<v Speaker 2>towards reproduction.</v>

1909
01:25:19.820 --> 01:25:24.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then also it makes the young men </v>

1910
01:25:24.820 --> 01:25:25.130
<v Speaker 3>strong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They think the only way for them to grow</v>

1911
01:25:25.131 --> 01:25:27.440
<v Speaker 3>and become strong as by adjusting semen</v>

1912
01:25:28.380 --> 01:25:32.330
<v Speaker 2>only 20 years ago in the Hazmat region,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were head hunters.</v>

1913
01:25:32.331 --> 01:25:34.250
<v Speaker 2>They were cannibals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean end to say,</v>

1914
01:25:34.430 --> 01:25:39.430
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no cannibalism anymore is kind </v>

1915
01:25:39.430 --> 01:25:41.291
<v Speaker 2>of a bit of a lie as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There still cannibalism in Papa New </v>

1916
01:25:41.291 --> 01:25:42.260
<v Speaker 2>Guinea just deleted each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not out front row center,</v>

1917
01:25:42.740 --> 01:25:46.280
<v Speaker 2>but they keep it offline basically to </v>
<v Speaker 2>keep it off of youtube.</v>

1918
01:25:46.760 --> 01:25:48.020
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

1919
01:25:48.021 --> 01:25:50.840
<v Speaker 2>there's some crazy stuff going on there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in the Hazmat region.</v>

1920
01:25:51.530 --> 01:25:56.530
<v Speaker 2>I spent quite a bit of time there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what I find interesting is you got this </v>

1921
01:25:56.530 --> 01:25:58.520
<v Speaker 2>culture as old as the aboriginals in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Australia,</v>

1922
01:25:58.521 --> 01:25:59.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking 60,000</v>

1923
01:25:59.871 --> 01:26:01.940
<v Speaker 2>years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very old culture,</v>

1924
01:26:01.941 --> 01:26:05.390
<v Speaker 2>living in perfect harmony nature in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mangroves there and they're not even,</v>

1925
01:26:05.940 --> 01:26:07.570
<v Speaker 2>they're not even stone people that just </v>
<v Speaker 2>would.</v>

1926
01:26:07.610 --> 01:26:12.610
<v Speaker 2>People you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't even have anything and then </v>

1927
01:26:12.610 --> 01:26:12.610
<v Speaker 2>now you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1928
01:26:12.610 --> 01:26:16.240
<v Speaker 2>it's an Indonesian province and you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of mosques being built and a lot </v>

1929
01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:18.560
<v Speaker 2>of stuff that's kind of creeping in.</v>

1930
01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:23.560
<v Speaker 2>Western civilization is creeping in and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the most disgusting thing I saw is that </v>

1931
01:26:23.560 --> 01:26:28.360
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've always gone down to the market </v>

1932
01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:28.360
<v Speaker 2>and bought some food and it's in wrapped</v>
<v Speaker 2>in banana leaf.</v>

1933
01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:30.420
<v Speaker 2>They eat the food and they throw the </v>
<v Speaker 2>banana leaf off the board,</v>

1934
01:26:30.421 --> 01:26:34.910
<v Speaker 2>walk into the water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the mercantile empires now in there,</v>

1935
01:26:34.911 --> 01:26:39.911
<v Speaker 2>you know there's lots of other people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Chinese Japanese coming in and being </v>

1936
01:26:39.911 --> 01:26:41.180
<v Speaker 2>merchants and they sell everything in </v>
<v Speaker 2>plastic,</v>

1937
01:26:41.420 --> 01:26:43.820
<v Speaker 2>single use packets and so the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

1938
01:26:43.821 --> 01:26:45.290
<v Speaker 2>There's no garbage bins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing around.</v>

1939
01:26:45.291 --> 01:26:46.460
<v Speaker 2>They open it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they eat the food,</v>

1940
01:26:46.461 --> 01:26:51.461
<v Speaker 2>they throw the plastic over there is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>meter and a half to two meters of just </v>

1941
01:26:51.461 --> 01:26:54.410
<v Speaker 2>piles of plastic everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely everywhere because they don't</v>

1942
01:26:54.411 --> 01:26:56.990
<v Speaker 2>have any ability that I've got no </v>
<v Speaker 2>education on it.</v>

1943
01:26:56.991 --> 01:27:01.670
<v Speaker 2>They've got no garbage collection and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's bloody disgusting.</v>

1944
01:27:01.700 --> 01:27:06.700
<v Speaker 2>Like it's crazy that you go to a beach </v>
<v Speaker 2>scene in Australia and you'll see one or</v>

1945
01:27:07.101 --> 01:27:08.210
<v Speaker 2>two bits of plastic and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1946
01:27:08.211 --> 01:27:09.410
<v Speaker 2>this is terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you pick it up,</v>

1947
01:27:09.411 --> 01:27:14.411
<v Speaker 2>you go there and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need like 50 dump trucks to even get </v>

1948
01:27:14.411 --> 01:27:14.930
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stop on this.</v>

1949
01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:20.560
<v Speaker 2>The plastic problem in the ocean is huge</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's not until you kind of get go </v>

1950
01:27:20.560 --> 01:27:24.011
<v Speaker 2>through Indonesia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even the Maldives Seychelles so much </v>

1951
01:27:24.011 --> 01:27:26.900
<v Speaker 2>plastic everywhere and it's like meter </v>
<v Speaker 2>high in places.</v>

1952
01:27:27.220 --> 01:27:32.220
<v Speaker 3>Heard the Maldives is one of the primary</v>
<v Speaker 3>groups of islands that are at risk of a </v>

1953
01:27:33.550 --> 01:27:34.810
<v Speaker 3>global warming of being.</v>

1954
01:27:35.250 --> 01:27:40.250
<v Speaker 2>The highest point on the capital in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Maltese is two meters high.</v>

1955
01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:42.360
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1956
01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:45.910
<v Speaker 2>When the tsunami in 2004 came,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it went over the entire island.</v>

1957
01:27:45.940 --> 01:27:48.850
<v Speaker 2>I think it was only a little tiny patch </v>
<v Speaker 2>that didn't have seawater go over it.</v>

1958
01:27:48.910 --> 01:27:53.910
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got a picture on the instagram is </v>

1959
01:27:53.910 --> 01:27:53.910
<v Speaker 2>one of the first pictures ever put up </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1960
01:27:53.910 --> 01:27:56.560
<v Speaker 2>All of the capital and you'll see it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like 250,000</v>

1961
01:27:56.561 --> 01:28:01.210
<v Speaker 2>people in a tiny little island and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>shocking like there.</v>

1962
01:28:01.290 --> 01:28:02.800
<v Speaker 2>They're serious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just pumped straight out.</v>

1963
01:28:02.801 --> 01:28:07.801
<v Speaker 2>There's another island next to it that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>the garbage island where they just take </v>

1964
01:28:07.801 --> 01:28:07.990
<v Speaker 2>all the garbage and burn it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's this constant,</v>

1965
01:28:07.991 --> 01:28:11.260
<v Speaker 2>massive fire on the nearest island where</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just burn garbage.</v>

1966
01:28:12.290 --> 01:28:14.710
<v Speaker 2>It's environmental catastrophe</v>

1967
01:28:15.630 --> 01:28:18.570
<v Speaker 3>that went through that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the Maldives?</v>

1968
01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:21.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

1969
01:28:21.790 --> 01:28:23.390
<v Speaker 3>But this is Indonesia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Papua New Guinea.</v>

1970
01:28:23.450 --> 01:28:27.020
<v Speaker 3>Like oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That picture.</v>

1971
01:28:27.050 --> 01:28:29.820
<v Speaker 3>So disturbing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That first picture,</v>

1972
01:28:29.821 --> 01:28:34.821
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go back to that first one that you </v>

1973
01:28:34.821 --> 01:28:34.821
<v Speaker 3>posted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

1974
01:28:34.821 --> 01:28:37.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is God damned insane.</v>

1975
01:28:37.181 --> 01:28:37.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1976
01:28:37.260 --> 01:28:42.260
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were on these tours and we would </v>

1977
01:28:42.260 --> 01:28:43.651
<v Speaker 2>actually spend the first hour before </v>
<v Speaker 2>guests come over just cleaning up </v>

1978
01:28:43.651 --> 01:28:47.490
<v Speaker 2>plastic and then the first guest to come</v>
<v Speaker 2>over with generally help us clean </v>

1979
01:28:47.490 --> 01:28:47.490
<v Speaker 2>plastics as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we would take back 10,</v>

1980
01:28:47.490 --> 01:28:51.070
<v Speaker 2>20 bags of garbage just so you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>walk along a little bit of the beach and</v>

1981
01:28:51.071 --> 01:28:51.970
<v Speaker 2>not have plastic everywhere.</v>

1982
01:28:52.130 --> 01:28:54.620
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's horrible.</v>

1983
01:28:57.170 --> 01:28:59.010
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you,</v>

1984
01:28:59.011 --> 01:29:01.680
<v Speaker 3>when you see the sheer numbers game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>

1985
01:29:01.681 --> 01:29:02.010
<v Speaker 3>what was</v>

1986
01:29:02.050 --> 01:29:07.050
<v Speaker 1>your google search so people could check</v>
<v Speaker 1>out these images that are listening to </v>

1987
01:29:07.050 --> 01:29:07.440
<v Speaker 1>this plastic island?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1988
01:29:09.060 --> 01:29:14.060
<v Speaker 1>that's so horrific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an entire island is just covered </v>

1989
01:29:14.060 --> 01:29:17.970
<v Speaker 1>with shit plastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1990
01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:19.860
<v Speaker 1>People are so quick and they're just </v>
<v Speaker 1>finding it.</v>

1991
01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:21.840
<v Speaker 1>That's the only way they can do anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

1992
01:29:21.880 --> 01:29:25.740
<v Speaker 1>It was burning and that's the only </v>
<v Speaker 1>250,000</v>

1993
01:29:25.741 --> 01:29:26.520
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1994
01:29:26.550 --> 01:29:28.470
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the capital.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm leery of that.</v>

1995
01:29:28.530 --> 01:29:30.380
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie capital.</v>

1996
01:29:30.430 --> 01:29:32.070
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's one of the first images</v>
<v Speaker 1>that have.</v>

1997
01:29:32.250 --> 01:29:35.540
<v Speaker 1>Look at that photo of the capital.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1998
01:29:36.460 --> 01:29:38.730
<v Speaker 1>I was cruising past and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took a picture with a,</v>

1999
01:29:38.731 --> 01:29:43.731
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a drone at sunset and it's quite </v>

2000
01:29:43.731 --> 01:29:43.731
<v Speaker 1>pitcher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I quite like it.</v>

2001
01:29:43.731 --> 01:29:47.460
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you just see the amount of people </v>

2002
01:29:47.460 --> 01:29:49.440
<v Speaker 1>packed into this tiny little space and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've just got,</v>

2003
01:29:49.730 --> 01:29:52.740
<v Speaker 1>they've got no means to recycle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do anything about it.</v>

2004
01:29:52.741 --> 01:29:57.741
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's probably got a couple of </v>

2005
01:29:57.741 --> 01:29:58.770
<v Speaker 1>decades and then it'll be all those </v>
<v Speaker 1>people have to go somewhere else.</v>

2006
01:29:59.310 --> 01:30:04.310
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always feel like I want to fly over </v>

2007
01:30:04.310 --> 01:30:04.310
<v Speaker 1>Honolulu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Honolulu.</v>

2008
01:30:04.310 --> 01:30:05.840
<v Speaker 1>It's like so strange because the Hawaii,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2009
01:30:05.940 --> 01:30:07.020
<v Speaker 1>a Wahoo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it is,</v>

2010
01:30:07.620 --> 01:30:10.860
<v Speaker 1>has a million people on it and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>that big man.</v>

2011
01:30:11.130 --> 01:30:13.020
<v Speaker 1>It's not that big at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that it right there?</v>

2012
01:30:13.021 --> 01:30:18.021
<v Speaker 1>You flew over and took the top photo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Jamie's trying to still trying </v>

2013
01:30:18.781 --> 01:30:23.781
<v Speaker 1>to find it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it would actually go to </v>

2014
01:30:23.781 --> 01:30:27.100
<v Speaker 1>scrolling or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some reason his instagram pages and </v>

2015
01:30:27.100 --> 01:30:27.100
<v Speaker 1>letting me see past this last like 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>pictures I have to do.</v>

2016
01:30:27.190 --> 01:30:28.600
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's up on the screen now.</v>

2017
01:30:28.700 --> 01:30:31.020
<v Speaker 1>Unless you want to bring that up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>

2018
01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:32.880
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

2019
01:30:33.360 --> 01:30:34.920
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's insane,</v>

2020
01:30:34.921 --> 01:30:39.921
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how do people think this is </v>

2021
01:30:39.921 --> 01:30:42.081
<v Speaker 1>sustainable?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like let's just build a massive city on </v>

2022
01:30:42.081 --> 01:30:42.081
<v Speaker 1>a tiny little island with no food.</v>

2023
01:30:42.081 --> 01:30:42.081
<v Speaker 1>There's no food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything's important.</v>

2024
01:30:42.090 --> 01:30:44.160
<v Speaker 1>They had a water crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was last year.</v>

2025
01:30:44.340 --> 01:30:46.110
<v Speaker 1>They had to import all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If all the water.</v>

2026
01:30:46.740 --> 01:30:49.920
<v Speaker 1>This is on your instagram that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>could see that visit.</v>

2027
01:30:49.921 --> 01:30:52.310
<v Speaker 1>There's a shot on the instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's.</v>

2028
01:30:52.830 --> 01:30:57.830
<v Speaker 1>That's chaotic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like one of the worst </v>

2029
01:30:57.830 --> 01:31:01.581
<v Speaker 1>engineered civilizations ever and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no what we're looking at folks </v>

2030
01:31:01.581 --> 01:31:02.490
<v Speaker 1>with the people that are just listening </v>
<v Speaker 1>to this,</v>

2031
01:31:02.491 --> 01:31:06.000
<v Speaker 1>which is most of the people we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at like a small island,</v>

2032
01:31:06.001 --> 01:31:11.001
<v Speaker 1>not very big because you can see the </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire thing and it's filled with </v>

2033
01:31:11.001 --> 01:31:14.040
<v Speaker 1>buildings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no nothing but buildings.</v>

2034
01:31:14.420 --> 01:31:16.230
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't agree with any parks in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

2035
01:31:16.620 --> 01:31:19.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's like a few field or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like patches of green,</v>

2036
01:31:19.650 --> 01:31:24.650
<v Speaker 1>like very small,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most of it is just stacked </v>

2037
01:31:24.650 --> 01:31:26.070
<v Speaker 1>buildings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2038
01:31:26.610 --> 01:31:28.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean it brings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whenever I look at this,</v>

2039
01:31:28.231 --> 01:31:29.970
<v Speaker 1>I just think of suburbia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing,</v>

2040
01:31:29.971 --> 01:31:34.971
<v Speaker 1>like we all live in these little patches</v>
<v Speaker 1>of land that if we wanted to grow her </v>

2041
01:31:34.971 --> 01:31:35.280
<v Speaker 1>own food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we couldn't support ourselves.</v>

2042
01:31:35.281 --> 01:31:36.870
<v Speaker 1>We couldn't support anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2043
01:31:36.871 --> 01:31:39.600
<v Speaker 1>this is an argument for the asshole that</v>
<v Speaker 1>used to run Australia.</v>

2044
01:31:39.601 --> 01:31:40.620
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy had it,</v>

2045
01:31:40.621 --> 01:31:41.120
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2046
01:31:41.430 --> 01:31:43.680
<v Speaker 1>Don't let everybody come and ruin your </v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful party.</v>

2047
01:31:43.950 --> 01:31:48.950
<v Speaker 1>You guys have a beautiful party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a continental United States </v>

2048
01:31:48.950 --> 01:31:50.520
<v Speaker 1>with as many people as Los Angeles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

2049
01:31:51.540 --> 01:31:53.160
<v Speaker 1>But you have some spots where you can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>really live.</v>

2050
01:31:53.161 --> 01:31:53.940
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I mean.</v>

2051
01:31:53.941 --> 01:31:58.941

<v Speaker 1>Livable people have massive out there.</v>

<v Speaker 2>China does.</v>

2054

<v Speaker 2>That's a good one to bring up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>

2055
01:32:04.650 --> 01:32:07.690
<v Speaker 2>where there's a map of Australia and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Chinese ownership.</v>

2056
01:32:07.840 --> 01:32:10.060
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

2057
01:32:10.090 --> 01:32:13.210

2058
01:32:13.211 --> 01:32:18.211
<v Speaker 2>these massive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>massive farms in central Australia to </v>

2059
01:32:18.211 --> 01:32:20.610
<v Speaker 2>China over the last five years or so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the farms growing cattle,</v>

2060
01:32:21.520 --> 01:32:24.210
<v Speaker 2>whatever it mainly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mainly it's kind of a livestock.</v>

2061
01:32:24.520 --> 01:32:29.520
<v Speaker 2>And are these Chinese folks taking these</v>
<v Speaker 2>cattle and importing the beef in China </v>

2062
01:32:29.741 --> 01:32:32.680
<v Speaker 2>or like most of it will go straight to </v>
<v Speaker 2>China basically.</v>

2063
01:32:32.681 --> 01:32:37.681
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they just decided to buy some land </v>

2064
01:32:37.681 --> 01:32:38.410
<v Speaker 2>and grow some cows in a new spot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well we were already growing cows there,</v>

2065
01:32:38.411 --> 01:32:43.411
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just bought them and then export </v>

2066
01:32:43.411 --> 01:32:45.031
<v Speaker 2>them to China.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the just the sheer area is what's </v>

2067
01:32:45.031 --> 01:32:48.130
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking for pictures of the thing.</v>

2068
01:32:48.131 --> 01:32:53.131
<v Speaker 2>But this is a block the size of an Ohio </v>
<v Speaker 2>sized ranch that's just the latest one </v>

2069
01:32:54.700 --> 01:32:59.700
<v Speaker 2>block the sale of a massive private </v>
<v Speaker 2>cattle ranch to foreign buyer saying it </v>

2070
01:32:59.700 --> 01:33:00.280
<v Speaker 2>was contrary to the national interest.</v>

2071
01:33:01.070 --> 01:33:03.290
<v Speaker 2>Mm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I mean like it.</v>

2072
01:33:04.030 --> 01:33:05.970
<v Speaker 2>On one hand you'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well hey that's,</v>

2073
01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:09.940
<v Speaker 2>that's Zena phobic and it's awful and </v>
<v Speaker 2>why would you do that?</v>

2074
01:33:09.941 --> 01:33:13.180
<v Speaker 2>But if you want to keep it the way it </v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

2075
01:33:13.570 --> 01:33:15.190
<v Speaker 2>it's really no other way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2076
01:33:15.640 --> 01:33:16.560
<v Speaker 2>I just think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2077
01:33:16.690 --> 01:33:21.690
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the moment we as an Australian </v>

2078
01:33:21.690 --> 01:33:22.810
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't get any real benefit from that.</v>

2079
01:33:22.811 --> 01:33:26.140
<v Speaker 2>We don't the profits go overseas or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>product produce goes overseas.</v>

2080
01:33:26.141 --> 01:33:28.060
<v Speaker 2>We're not really seeing any benefit for </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2081
01:33:28.061 --> 01:33:29.350
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2082
01:33:29.351 --> 01:33:30.700
<v Speaker 2>if we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we didn't sell it,</v>

2083
01:33:30.701 --> 01:33:33.700
<v Speaker 2>if we leased it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely agree at least that stuff,</v>

2084
01:33:33.701 --> 01:33:34.400
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2085
01:33:34.500 --> 01:33:39.500
<v Speaker 2>but we should,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Australian people should retain </v>

2086
01:33:39.500 --> 01:33:41.080
<v Speaker 2>ownership of that because I mean if ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>do find the map,</v>

2087
01:33:41.081 --> 01:33:43.510
<v Speaker 2>it's of course the colors and red to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make it scary.</v>

2088
01:33:43.680 --> 01:33:48.250
<v Speaker 2>And then it's a lot of Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a billionaire buys $47,000,000</v>

2089
01:33:48.251 --> 01:33:51.370
<v Speaker 2>worth of Australian cattle ranches to </v>
<v Speaker 2>feed China's hunger for beef.</v>

2090
01:33:54.580 --> 01:33:57.010
<v Speaker 2>China's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a crazy place.</v>

2091
01:33:57.580 --> 01:33:58.990
<v Speaker 2>It's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting.</v>

2092
01:33:59.140 --> 01:33:59.930
<v Speaker 2>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2093
01:34:00.520 --> 01:34:01.100
<v Speaker 2>Well it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2094
01:34:01.210 --> 01:34:03.430
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean again,</v>

2095
01:34:03.580 --> 01:34:08.580
<v Speaker 2>the different styles of culture that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>find the different styles of the way </v>

2096
01:34:08.580 --> 01:34:13.381
<v Speaker 2>human beings exist and coexist on this </v>
<v Speaker 2>planet as one of the weirder aspects of </v>

2097
01:34:14.231 --> 01:34:18.160
<v Speaker 2>traveling that you see what's normal to </v>
<v Speaker 2>these people.</v>

2098
01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:18.910
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's different.</v>

2099
01:34:18.911 --> 01:34:22.240
<v Speaker 2>Every country you could everywhere and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they accept it.</v>

2100
01:34:22.300 --> 01:34:27.300
<v Speaker 2>It's like this is our normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I like about China is that when it </v>

2101
01:34:27.731 --> 01:34:32.731
<v Speaker 2>makes the decision on something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's looking 40 years in the future </v>

2102
01:34:32.731 --> 01:34:33.040
<v Speaker 2>because it's by committee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2103
01:34:34.390 --> 01:34:36.400
<v Speaker 2>when we in Australia or the states,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2104
01:34:36.401 --> 01:34:38.860
<v Speaker 2>we make a decision based on the election</v>
<v Speaker 2>cycle.</v>

2105
01:34:38.861 --> 01:34:42.910
<v Speaker 2>It's based in what can we get four years</v>
<v Speaker 2>time and that's where I think China will</v>

2106
01:34:42.911 --> 01:34:47.911
<v Speaker 2>actually leapfrog a lot of western </v>
<v Speaker 2>society because what they're doing now </v>

2107
01:34:47.911 --> 01:34:51.631
<v Speaker 2>is thinking about in 40 years time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're building big infrastructure </v>

2108
01:34:51.631 --> 01:34:55.920
<v Speaker 2>before it's even required.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where we in the Western world seem to </v>

2109
01:34:55.920 --> 01:34:56.140
<v Speaker 2>just have crumbling infrastructure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2110
01:34:56.990 --> 01:34:58.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We seem to be looking</v>

2111
01:34:58.430 --> 01:35:01.370
<v Speaker 3>like for years we looked like election </v>
<v Speaker 3>cycles.</v>

2112
01:35:01.580 --> 01:35:04.430
<v Speaker 3>Your elections,</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy luck in your election.</v>

2113
01:35:04.431 --> 01:35:07.520
<v Speaker 3>Goes on for like two years in Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy we're going to have an election</v>

2114
01:35:07.760 --> 01:35:10.790
<v Speaker 3>in 30 days time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'd go back and forth for 30 days.</v>

2115
01:35:10.791 --> 01:35:12.500
<v Speaker 3>We have an election,</v>
<v Speaker 3>30 days.</v>

2116
01:35:12.501 --> 01:35:13.520
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Problem solved.</v>

2117
01:35:13.580 --> 01:35:15.320
<v Speaker 3>We had to stare at the people for </v>
<v Speaker 3>Awhile,</v>

2118
01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:20.440
<v Speaker 3>chip away at their armor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>try to find out what the fuck came for </v>

2119
01:35:20.440 --> 01:35:20.810
<v Speaker 3>like two years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's just.</v>

2120
01:35:20.811 --> 01:35:23.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's messed up.</v>

2121
01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:25.190
<v Speaker 3>It is messed up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2122
01:35:25.191 --> 01:35:30.191
<v Speaker 3>it's also nobody really that you would </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to be president wants to be </v>

2123
01:35:30.191 --> 01:35:30.470
<v Speaker 3>president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2124
01:35:30.500 --> 01:35:32.510
<v Speaker 3>Ideally you would want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So why is that?</v>

2125
01:35:32.930 --> 01:35:34.700
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they dig into your personal life</v>

2126
01:35:34.701 --> 01:35:35.600
<v Speaker 3>too much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2127
01:35:35.620 --> 01:35:37.130
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they start fucking with your family.</v>

2128
01:35:37.131 --> 01:35:39.230
<v Speaker 3>You start fucking with your finances and</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking with.</v>

2129
01:35:39.530 --> 01:35:44.530
<v Speaker 3>They started interviewing people you </v>
<v Speaker 3>went to high school with and trying to </v>

2130
01:35:44.530 --> 01:35:46.931
<v Speaker 3>chip away at any one possible moral </v>
<v Speaker 3>issue you may or may not have had that </v>

2131
01:35:47.421 --> 01:35:52.421
<v Speaker 3>they can blow up and sticking your face </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're down to these like you get </v>

2132
01:35:52.421 --> 01:35:55.190
<v Speaker 3>like egomaniacs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like trump or massively religious people</v>

2133
01:35:55.191 --> 01:35:57.950
<v Speaker 3>like Ted Cruz and Ben Carson.</v>

2134
01:35:58.270 --> 01:36:01.400
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't understand Marco Rubio,</v>

2135
01:36:01.430 --> 01:36:01.970
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

2136
01:36:02.030 --> 01:36:07.030
<v Speaker 3>he's an odd one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you get Hillary Clinton who is </v>

2137
01:36:07.030 --> 01:36:09.731
<v Speaker 3>essentially a lifelong politician who </v>
<v Speaker 3>has been so deeply embedded into the </v>

2138
01:36:09.951 --> 01:36:14.180
<v Speaker 3>system that she isn't a massively low </v>
<v Speaker 3>trust rate.</v>

2139
01:36:14.540 --> 01:36:15.610
<v Speaker 3>Like the truck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the wrist,</v>

2140
01:36:15.620 --> 01:36:18.560
<v Speaker 3>it's like 37 percent of people trust </v>
<v Speaker 3>her.</v>

2141
01:36:19.110 --> 01:36:21.290
<v Speaker 3>This is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's crazy.</v>

2142
01:36:21.291 --> 01:36:23.990
<v Speaker 3>Sixty three percent of like no fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

2143
01:36:24.350 --> 01:36:26.150
<v Speaker 3>The vast majority,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2144
01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:28.960
<v Speaker 3>the obvious majority at least are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

2145
01:36:28.970 --> 01:36:30.470
<v Speaker 3>I don't trust her at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they,</v>

2146
01:36:30.730 --> 01:36:31.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have to.</v>

2147
01:36:32.010 --> 01:36:35.030
<v Speaker 3>So we have to see Joe Rogan for prison.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No fucking way.</v>

2148
01:36:35.270 --> 01:36:36.390
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't want that job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>

2149
01:36:36.470 --> 01:36:38.660
<v Speaker 3>It's a terrible job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's a thing.</v>

2150
01:36:38.780 --> 01:36:42.110
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I honestly believe is that the idea</v>

2151
01:36:42.111 --> 01:36:47.111
<v Speaker 3>is massively archaic and I think the </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea of having this one alpha primate </v>

2152
01:36:47.450 --> 01:36:51.410
<v Speaker 3>that runs the tribe was fine if there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>100 people,</v>

2153
01:36:51.650 --> 01:36:56.510
<v Speaker 3>but the idea of 300 million people being</v>
<v Speaker 3>run by this one figurehead is nuts.</v>

2154
01:36:56.690 --> 01:36:58.610
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't work anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's stupid.</v>

2155
01:36:58.870 --> 01:37:02.660
<v Speaker 3>What we should have is the president </v>
<v Speaker 3>should be like the queen of England.</v>

2156
01:37:02.900 --> 01:37:06.730
<v Speaker 3>Some goofball gets out and fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>bulletproof popemobile and drives around</v>

2157
01:37:06.731 --> 01:37:08.030
<v Speaker 3>a waves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one gives a shit,</v>

2158
01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:12.530
<v Speaker 3>but she doesn't really dictate policy </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think the real president should be</v>

2159
01:37:12.531 --> 01:37:17.531
<v Speaker 3>the internet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really believe firmly that with </v>

2160
01:37:17.531 --> 01:37:19.790
<v Speaker 3>education and with access to information</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we're all enjoying right now,</v>

2161
01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:25.000
<v Speaker 3>that maybe not now because we're in this</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of tumultuous turmoil filled </v>

2162
01:37:25.311 --> 01:37:30.020
<v Speaker 3>adolescent period,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think that as we get more and more</v>

2163
01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:33.920
<v Speaker 3>deeply embedded in the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 3>exchanging information,</v>

2164
01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:37.040
<v Speaker 3>I think we're going to be able to read </v>
<v Speaker 3>each other's minds.</v>

2165
01:37:37.160 --> 01:37:42.160
<v Speaker 3>We're going to be able to tap into </v>
<v Speaker 3>instantaneous information directly to </v>

2166
01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:46.691
<v Speaker 3>our mind and we're going to realize that</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only way this is all going to work </v>

2167
01:37:47.361 --> 01:37:52.361
<v Speaker 3>out is if we don't allow anyone to abuse</v>
<v Speaker 3>the environment for the sake of profit,</v>

2168
01:37:53.720 --> 01:37:56.880
<v Speaker 3>that we don't allow anyone to take life </v>
<v Speaker 3>for the sake of profit,</v>

2169
01:37:56.881 --> 01:38:01.881
<v Speaker 3>that we don't allow anyone to lie to us </v>
<v Speaker 3>about their motives for invading </v>

2170
01:38:01.881 --> 01:38:06.201
<v Speaker 3>countries or for for dictating certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>policy and especially for influencing </v>

2171
01:38:08.460 --> 01:38:11.370
<v Speaker 3>other countries in the fall for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>reason of profit.</v>

2172
01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:13.230
<v Speaker 3>We've got to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've got to stop that.</v>

2173
01:38:13.350 --> 01:38:18.350
<v Speaker 3>We got to figure out a way to stop that </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the only way to stop that is full </v>

2174
01:38:18.350 --> 01:38:20.130
<v Speaker 3>disclosure amongst our leader and his </v>
<v Speaker 3>parents.</v>

2175
01:38:20.340 --> 01:38:24.960
<v Speaker 3>Massive transparency and I think that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to happen in a natural way because</v>

2176
01:38:24.961 --> 01:38:27.330
<v Speaker 3>I think it's going to be unavoidable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think in the future,</v>

2177
01:38:27.390 --> 01:38:32.390
<v Speaker 3>like what you're seeing now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think one of the reasons why you've </v>

2178
01:38:32.390 --> 01:38:33.510
<v Speaker 3>seen this poor group of people running </v>
<v Speaker 3>for president is because the really rich</v>

2179
01:38:33.511 --> 01:38:38.511
<v Speaker 3>and influential people that maybe would </v>
<v Speaker 3>have run for president 20 or 30 years </v>

2180
01:38:38.511 --> 01:38:42.231
<v Speaker 3>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like fuck that job because it's just </v>

2181
01:38:42.231 --> 01:38:44.250
<v Speaker 3>too invasive and not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once you become president,</v>

2182
01:38:44.251 --> 01:38:47.100
<v Speaker 3>you have to have secret service live </v>
<v Speaker 3>with you for the rest of your life.</v>

2183
01:38:47.370 --> 01:38:50.160
<v Speaker 3>I mean you're constantly on guard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everywhere you go.</v>

2184
01:38:50.161 --> 01:38:51.860
<v Speaker 3>People hate you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

2185
01:38:51.900 --> 01:38:53.730
<v Speaker 3>it's a crazy nut job.</v>

2186
01:38:53.870 --> 01:38:56.170
<v Speaker 3>It's a job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like a,</v>

2187
01:38:57.260 --> 01:39:01.640
<v Speaker 3>you want it just because it's like this </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing to achieve and then.</v>

2188
01:39:01.710 --> 01:39:03.210
<v Speaker 3>But you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look at it on paper,</v>

2189
01:39:03.211 --> 01:39:04.100
<v Speaker 3>like what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is.</v>

2190
01:39:04.280 --> 01:39:05.910
<v Speaker 3>It's not like you're independently </v>
<v Speaker 3>wealthy.</v>

2191
01:39:05.911 --> 01:39:08.880
<v Speaker 3>Once you get in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you really make you make very good money</v>

2192
01:39:08.881 --> 01:39:12.840
<v Speaker 3>for the average person you make.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I think it's like 450 or $500,000</v>

2193
01:39:12.841 --> 01:39:13.790
<v Speaker 3>a year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2194
01:39:13.800 --> 01:39:18.800
<v Speaker 3>you certainly a good living,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's not like stuff with it.</v>

2195
01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:23.010
<v Speaker 3>It's not worth it then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they make money in the speeches.</v>

2196
01:39:23.030 --> 01:39:28.030
<v Speaker 3>That's really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's also the really weird thing you </v>

2197
01:39:28.030 --> 01:39:28.030
<v Speaker 3>find out like how much Bill Clinton </v>
<v Speaker 3>makes.</v>

2198
01:39:28.030 --> 01:39:31.020
<v Speaker 3>Giving speeches now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like they bribe you,</v>

2199
01:39:31.410 --> 01:39:34.950
<v Speaker 3>like for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for what your policies were in office.</v>

2200
01:39:34.951 --> 01:39:39.951
<v Speaker 3>It's sort of as only as sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>unwritten rule like do the right thing </v>

2201
01:39:39.951 --> 01:39:42.120
<v Speaker 3>when you're in and then when you're out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll have you come by.</v>

2202
01:39:43.250 --> 01:39:44.860
<v Speaker 2>If this company to this then</v>

2203
01:39:45.540 --> 01:39:50.540
<v Speaker 3>have you seen the democratic debates </v>
<v Speaker 3>between Bernie Sanders and Hillary </v>

2204
01:39:50.540 --> 01:39:51.630
<v Speaker 3>Clinton where he asks her for these </v>
<v Speaker 3>transcripts?</v>

2205
01:39:52.450 --> 01:39:53.190
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good for you.</v>

2206
01:39:53.640 --> 01:39:57.960
<v Speaker 3>You probably live in better to what does</v>
<v Speaker 3>this 150,</v>

2207
01:39:57.961 --> 01:40:00.720
<v Speaker 3>$3,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>in bill and Hillary Clinton speaking.</v>

2208
01:40:01.920 --> 01:40:06.920
<v Speaker 3>Mrs Clinton was paid directly by Wall </v>
<v Speaker 3>Street suggesting a conflict of </v>

2209
01:40:06.920 --> 01:40:06.990
<v Speaker 3>interest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Despite a recent distancing,</v>

2210
01:40:06.991 --> 01:40:11.700
<v Speaker 3>no matter how much Mrs Clinton hopes to </v>
<v Speaker 3>lure Bernie Sanders voters,</v>

2211
01:40:11.701 --> 01:40:15.560
<v Speaker 3>it must be hard at $220,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>to 200,</v>

2212
01:40:15.561 --> 01:40:16.680
<v Speaker 3>$5,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>a pop.</v>

2213
01:40:16.890 --> 01:40:21.000
<v Speaker 3>That's how much he gets paid for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>speech and he was like,</v>

2214
01:40:21.060 --> 01:40:26.060
<v Speaker 3>it must have been an amazing speech.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to see the transcript to this </v>

2215
01:40:26.060 --> 01:40:27.690
<v Speaker 3>beach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She ain't and she not releasing those.</v>

2216
01:40:27.800 --> 01:40:30.850
<v Speaker 2>I've got a bit of trouble for saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>this about a year ago.</v>

2217
01:40:31.490 --> 01:40:36.320
<v Speaker 2>I honestly think the whole trump </v>
<v Speaker 2>candidacy is a conspiracy theory to make</v>

2218
01:40:36.321 --> 01:40:41.321
<v Speaker 2>hillary win because you have someone so </v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy on that side that people go,</v>

2219
01:40:42.930 --> 01:40:43.640
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2220
01:40:43.641 --> 01:40:44.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've had our fun,</v>

2221
01:40:44.391 --> 01:40:49.391
<v Speaker 2>but time to get serious and they go for </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hillary because it's the better option </v>

2222
01:40:49.391 --> 01:40:51.500
<v Speaker 2>of the two man where I don't fully agree</v>
<v Speaker 2>with that too.</v>

2223
01:40:51.501 --> 01:40:53.140
<v Speaker 2>The truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think Hillary's a wonder.</v>

2224
01:40:53.870 --> 01:40:55.510
<v Speaker 2>I wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've got to.</v>

2225
01:40:55.540 --> 01:40:56.290
<v Speaker 2>I've got to start for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jay.</v>

2226
01:40:56.380 --> 01:40:58.540
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On that trip to Easter island.</v>

2227
01:40:58.541 --> 01:41:03.541
<v Speaker 2>So we went from Tahiti to Easter island </v>
<v Speaker 2>for about two weeks ago and we had um,</v>

2228
01:41:04.330 --> 01:41:07.210
<v Speaker 2>had a gentleman on board who was kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>my political hero.</v>

2229
01:41:07.420 --> 01:41:08.980
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his name was Bob Brown,</v>

2230
01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:11.350
<v Speaker 2>Australian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a senator,</v>

2231
01:41:11.390 --> 01:41:14.620
<v Speaker 2>leader of the Green Party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when I was growing up,</v>

2232
01:41:14.621 --> 01:41:19.621
<v Speaker 2>you'd have your talking heads,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some topic coming on and you'd have </v>

2233
01:41:19.621 --> 01:41:19.621
<v Speaker 2>basically the Republican and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Democrat,</v>

2234
01:41:19.621 --> 01:41:20.890
<v Speaker 2>we call them liberals and labor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

2235
01:41:21.490 --> 01:41:24.730
<v Speaker 2>And it would be stupid comment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stupid comment.</v>

2236
01:41:25.210 --> 01:41:27.340
<v Speaker 2>And then you'd have this third one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Greens guy.</v>

2237
01:41:27.370 --> 01:41:29.950
<v Speaker 2>He would come on and then just say </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that actually made sense.</v>

2238
01:41:30.250 --> 01:41:35.250
<v Speaker 2>And so the whole time growing up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a bit of a political hero of </v>

2239
01:41:35.250 --> 01:41:35.250
<v Speaker 2>mine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing worship or anything like that.</v>

2240
01:41:35.250 --> 01:41:35.980
<v Speaker 2>But I went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2241
01:41:36.010 --> 01:41:41.010
<v Speaker 2>out of all the politicians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy's got his head screwed on and </v>

2242
01:41:41.010 --> 01:41:41.440
<v Speaker 2>it's environmentally and progressive and</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that.</v>

2243
01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:46.920
<v Speaker 2>Environmentally conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he was on board is one of our guests </v>

2244
01:41:46.920 --> 01:41:48.280
<v Speaker 2>lecturers kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he did lots of talks,</v>

2245
01:41:48.370 --> 01:41:49.630
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fascinating,</v>

2246
01:41:49.631 --> 01:41:54.631
<v Speaker 2>fascinating guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I remember I did my climate change </v>

2247
01:41:54.631 --> 01:41:57.451
<v Speaker 2>talk and so he came up to me afterwards </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I hadn't had a long conversation </v>

2248
01:41:57.451 --> 01:41:57.580
<v Speaker 2>with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I went to,</v>

2249
01:41:57.581 --> 01:41:59.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>start going,</v>

2250
01:41:59.051 --> 01:42:00.250
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big fan,</v>

2251
01:42:00.251 --> 01:42:05.251
<v Speaker 2>Yada Yada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he turned around and when you add </v>

2252
01:42:05.251 --> 01:42:05.251
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2253
01:42:05.251 --> 01:42:07.690
<v Speaker 2>you need to be in politics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to be a senator for the Greens </v>

2254
01:42:07.690 --> 01:42:07.690
<v Speaker 2>in Australia.</v>

2255
01:42:07.690 --> 01:42:08.740
<v Speaker 2>And he pushed it big time especially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to do this,</v>

2256
01:42:08.741 --> 01:42:10.450
<v Speaker 2>you've got to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need,</v>

2257
01:42:10.451 --> 01:42:11.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>younger people like you to do.</v>

2258
01:42:12.220 --> 01:42:14.790
<v Speaker 2>And I must admit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought about it because I want to not</v>

2259
01:42:15.010 --> 01:42:20.010
<v Speaker 2>change the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I want to do something to make this </v>

2260
01:42:20.010 --> 01:42:20.010
<v Speaker 2>earth a slightly better than what I </v>
<v Speaker 2>arrived.</v>

2261
01:42:20.010 --> 01:42:21.940
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's a way to do it for sure.</v>

2262
01:42:21.970 --> 01:42:26.970
<v Speaker 2>The thing that keeps me back from doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>it is I would have to put up with </v>

2263
01:42:26.970 --> 01:42:30.610
<v Speaker 2>politicians all day who would want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>put up with politicians,</v>

2264
01:42:30.630 --> 01:42:35.630
<v Speaker 2>order.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm miserable bunch of </v>

2265
01:42:35.630 --> 01:42:38.041
<v Speaker 2>people and I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I haven't watched much cspan of </v>

2266
01:42:38.041 --> 01:42:38.530
<v Speaker 2>Congress and stuff over here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But our parliament,</v>

2267
01:42:38.680 --> 01:42:40.840
<v Speaker 2>they just sit there pitching each other </v>
<v Speaker 2>continuously,</v>

2268
01:42:40.841 --> 01:42:45.841
<v Speaker 2>if that's totally true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the English parliament and </v>

2269
01:42:45.841 --> 01:42:46.750
<v Speaker 2>ever seen where they'd just be using </v>
<v Speaker 2>each other basically and yelling,</v>

2270
01:42:46.751 --> 01:42:50.080
<v Speaker 2>calling each other names all the time </v>
<v Speaker 2>when they have a vote and they don't,</v>

2271
01:42:50.270 --> 01:42:55.270
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they know the vote's not going to go </v>

2272
01:42:55.270 --> 01:42:55.270
<v Speaker 2>their way.</v>

2273
01:42:55.270 --> 01:42:57.240
<v Speaker 2>You didn't have to have like 60 percent </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the people there to make the vote </v>

2274
01:42:57.240 --> 01:43:00.031
<v Speaker 2>count.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They all run for the doors and try and </v>

2275
01:43:00.031 --> 01:43:02.371
<v Speaker 2>get out before they lock the doors so </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's not enough people that </v>

2276
01:43:02.371 --> 01:43:05.180
<v Speaker 2>actually actually make it past.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just act like little school </v>

2277
01:43:05.180 --> 01:43:05.200
<v Speaker 2>children kind of run.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They run.</v>

2278
01:43:05.201 --> 01:43:08.100
<v Speaker 2>Our prime minister is sprinting because </v>
<v Speaker 2>I go to.</v>

2279
01:43:08.101 --> 01:43:10.780
<v Speaker 2>The doors are going to be locked in two </v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes and he's Brinton out of his seat</v>

2280
01:43:10.781 --> 01:43:12.640
<v Speaker 2>to get out that door because we get to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that that door.</v>

2281
01:43:12.641 --> 01:43:17.641
<v Speaker 2>Then he doesn't vote and there's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough votes and then it doesn't go </v>

2282
01:43:17.641 --> 01:43:17.790
<v Speaker 2>through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like we paying these people to</v>

2283
01:43:17.791 --> 01:43:21.820
<v Speaker 2>represent us and they're just acting </v>
<v Speaker 2>like little children or goofy law.</v>

2284
01:43:21.850 --> 01:43:23.800
<v Speaker 2>Why would you want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would you want to surround yourself?</v>

2285
01:43:23.801 --> 01:43:26.290
<v Speaker 2>Imagine waking up everyday and </v>
<v Speaker 2>surrounding yourself with that.</v>

2286
01:43:27.010 --> 01:43:32.010
<v Speaker 3>I think we'd be way better off if </v>
<v Speaker 3>individual human beings across the </v>

2287
01:43:32.010 --> 01:43:34.990
<v Speaker 3>board,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the giant mass of us,</v>

2288
01:43:35.170 --> 01:43:40.170
<v Speaker 3>if we all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone adult had a say instead of an </v>

2289
01:43:40.170 --> 01:43:42.430
<v Speaker 3>elected government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a representative government.</v>

2290
01:43:42.820 --> 01:43:45.760
<v Speaker 3>If we all had to say and we we'd have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>come up with one zero.</v>

2291
01:43:45.940 --> 01:43:47.110
<v Speaker 3>A real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

2292
01:43:47.111 --> 01:43:52.111
<v Speaker 3>That's a great way of pointing it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the representative government </v>

2293
01:43:52.111 --> 01:43:55.921
<v Speaker 3>was great idea back in the day when it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was impossible to communicate with each </v>

2294
01:43:55.921 --> 01:43:55.921
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't need it anymore.</v>

2295
01:43:55.921 --> 01:43:55.921
<v Speaker 3>We don't need it.</v>

2296
01:43:56.790 --> 01:43:58.560
<v Speaker 2>Two point zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a gentleman potty,</v>

2297
01:43:58.750 --> 01:44:03.750
<v Speaker 2>they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They tried to do it and you know that </v>

2298
01:44:03.750 --> 01:44:05.580
<v Speaker 2>were quite successful but didn't get </v>
<v Speaker 2>elected into power so it couldn't do it,</v>

2299
01:44:05.581 --> 01:44:07.350
<v Speaker 2>but their idea was to use two point </v>
<v Speaker 2>zero.</v>

2300
01:44:07.351 --> 01:44:10.080
<v Speaker 2>We just make a website and you've got </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever issue we're voting on.</v>

2301
01:44:10.380 --> 01:44:15.380
<v Speaker 2>Everyone can vote and and where I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>they went wrong because this is </v>

2302
01:44:15.380 --> 01:44:18.210
<v Speaker 2>something I've thought about quite </v>
<v Speaker 2>considerably is where they went wrong is</v>

2303
01:44:18.211 --> 01:44:19.260
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to change the whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>

2304
01:44:19.261 --> 01:44:20.250
<v Speaker 2>So the gun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to come in,</v>

2305
01:44:20.251 --> 01:44:22.110
<v Speaker 2>we're gonna change the whole system and </v>
<v Speaker 2>people freak out.</v>

2306
01:44:22.120 --> 01:44:24.630
<v Speaker 2>Then of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I feel it.</v>

2307
01:44:24.631 --> 01:44:29.631
<v Speaker 2>Hang on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there a way to achieve the same goal </v>

2308
01:44:29.631 --> 01:44:31.440
<v Speaker 2>but through the nonprofit angle instead </v>
<v Speaker 2>of trying to change the whole thing,</v>

2309
01:44:31.680 --> 01:44:36.680
<v Speaker 2>and so it's something I started on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started working on and it's been put </v>

2310
01:44:36.680 --> 01:44:37.740
<v Speaker 2>to the sidelines because I travel the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world and I'm busy,</v>

2311
01:44:38.470 --> 01:44:41.490
<v Speaker 2>but earth vote.network</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you had a place where you could go</v>

2312
01:44:41.491 --> 01:44:46.491
<v Speaker 2>and vote like a petition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's that one question that you </v>

2313
01:44:46.491 --> 01:44:50.241
<v Speaker 2>answer stays on forever and so then </v>
<v Speaker 2>because in Australia all the time you </v>

2314
01:44:50.241 --> 01:44:52.830
<v Speaker 2>pick up a Murdoch newspaper and it'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>say 94 percent of Australians think this</v>

2315
01:44:53.160 --> 01:44:58.160
<v Speaker 2>and then you read down the bottom out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>a survey of a 500 people ringing </v>

2316
01:44:58.160 --> 01:44:59.010
<v Speaker 2>landlines in one suburb in Sydney.</v>

2317
01:44:59.010 --> 01:45:04.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not a representation of what's </v>

2318
01:45:04.010 --> 01:45:04.010
<v Speaker 2>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if I could turn around and go,</v>

2319
01:45:04.010 --> 01:45:07.290
<v Speaker 2>here's half a million people and he is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the percentage of what they think.</v>

2320
01:45:07.291 --> 01:45:09.960
<v Speaker 2>Then you're getting a more accurate </v>
<v Speaker 2>representation of what's going on.</v>

2321
01:45:10.950 --> 01:45:14.610
<v Speaker 2>I think there's room for a website like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that and obviously I've kind of given up</v>

2322
01:45:14.611 --> 01:45:16.920
<v Speaker 2>on doing it myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hence why I'm mentioning it right now.</v>

2323
01:45:16.921 --> 01:45:21.921
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully someone else takes it up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's huge potential in taking </v>

2324
01:45:21.921 --> 01:45:26.601
<v Speaker 2>clicktivism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we currently see on facebook and </v>

2325
01:45:26.601 --> 01:45:28.731
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's happy to click on a link and </v>

2326
01:45:28.731 --> 01:45:28.860
<v Speaker 2>spread the good word about some </v>
<v Speaker 2>environmental concern,</v>

2327
01:45:28.861 --> 01:45:31.410
<v Speaker 2>but actually do something they're not so</v>
<v Speaker 2>willing to do.</v>

2328
01:45:32.430 --> 01:45:37.430
<v Speaker 2>If you collate all that clicktivism into</v>
<v Speaker 2>one spot and then you have data coming </v>

2329
01:45:37.531 --> 01:45:39.780
<v Speaker 2>out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it actually becomes useful with actually</v>

2330
01:45:40.020 --> 01:45:41.730
<v Speaker 2>can be used where you can go to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>politician,</v>

2331
01:45:41.740 --> 01:45:42.210
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2332
01:45:42.750 --> 01:45:45.840
<v Speaker 2>80 percent of your electric think this </v>
<v Speaker 2>so your represent them.</v>

2333
01:45:45.930 --> 01:45:50.930
<v Speaker 2>Go do it and you've got some way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the other aspect to it is to </v>

2334
01:45:51.001 --> 01:45:53.880
<v Speaker 2>then actually do a kind of vote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not voting.</v>

2335
01:45:54.050 --> 01:45:57.750
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep a system of the politicians.</v>

2336
01:45:57.751 --> 01:46:02.751
<v Speaker 2>So say 80 percent of Australia thinks </v>
<v Speaker 2>this things and then the politician,</v>

2337
01:46:03.660 --> 01:46:05.460
<v Speaker 2>the votes for a bill that's against </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2338
01:46:05.490 --> 01:46:07.590
<v Speaker 2>Then you give them a minus one point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they vote for it,</v>

2339
01:46:07.591 --> 01:46:09.150
<v Speaker 2>you get an a plus one point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

2340
01:46:09.151 --> 01:46:14.151
<v Speaker 2>And so eventually you would work out </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically which politicians are </v>

2341
01:46:14.151 --> 01:46:15.930
<v Speaker 2>accurately representing their </v>
<v Speaker 2>constituents and which ones are not.</v>

2342
01:46:16.230 --> 01:46:21.230
<v Speaker 2>And that's what we don't have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you know that this guy that </v>

2343
01:46:21.230 --> 01:46:21.750
<v Speaker 2>you're voting for has been representing </v>
<v Speaker 2>the constituents?</v>

2344
01:46:21.751 --> 01:46:26.751
<v Speaker 2>You don't really know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to go back and look through </v>

2345
01:46:26.751 --> 01:46:26.751
<v Speaker 2>10 years of newspaper articles and try </v>
<v Speaker 2>and deduce it.</v>

2346
01:46:26.751 --> 01:46:28.770
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if you could formulate that into</v>
<v Speaker 2>a website,</v>

2347
01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:30.480
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'd be a pretty powerful thing.</v>

2348
01:46:30.810 --> 01:46:33.120
<v Speaker 3>It'd be a very powerful thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the future.</v>

2349
01:46:33.270 --> 01:46:35.520
<v Speaker 3>I think the future,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as we were saying,</v>

2350
01:46:35.790 --> 01:46:38.630
<v Speaker 3>as we get more access to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2351
01:46:39.240 --> 01:46:44.240
<v Speaker 3>the way people are influenced,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we understand where the money's </v>

2352
01:46:44.240 --> 01:46:46.970
<v Speaker 3>actually coming from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is way more today than it's ever </v>

2353
01:46:46.970 --> 01:46:47.670
<v Speaker 3>been in the past 30,</v>
<v Speaker 3>40 years ago.</v>

2354
01:46:47.850 --> 01:46:52.850
<v Speaker 3>It was really difficult to out what was </v>
<v Speaker 3>motivating certain presidents or people </v>

2355
01:46:52.850 --> 01:46:57.111
<v Speaker 3>that were candidates and you only got to</v>
<v Speaker 3>see what they were projecting in front </v>

2356
01:46:57.111 --> 01:46:57.900
<v Speaker 3>of the television what they were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why debates are important.</v>

2357
01:46:58.120 --> 01:47:00.020
<v Speaker 3>You get to see the way they spoke and </v>
<v Speaker 3>debates.</v>

2358
01:47:00.040 --> 01:47:03.260
<v Speaker 3>Try to decipher and peel through it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no,</v>

2359
01:47:03.330 --> 01:47:06.360
<v Speaker 3>we never had the kind of transparency </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we have today and this is</v>

2360
01:47:06.520 --> 01:47:08.470
<v Speaker 1>you want to know what's really going on </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a politician.</v>

2361
01:47:08.590 --> 01:47:12.160
<v Speaker 1>Get them on the Joe Rogan podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get politician for three hours.</v>

2362
01:47:12.161 --> 01:47:17.161
<v Speaker 1>They accomplish it for that long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be at some point you would </v>

2363
01:47:17.161 --> 01:47:18.190
<v Speaker 1>get under them and you would find out </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's actually going to do.</v>

2364
01:47:18.191 --> 01:47:21.760
<v Speaker 1>A lot of research though that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I couldn't just have mom like you and</v>

2365
01:47:21.761 --> 01:47:23.290
<v Speaker 1>just go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's talk man.</v>

2366
01:47:23.320 --> 01:47:26.310
<v Speaker 1>I would have to go deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

2367
01:47:26.530 --> 01:47:30.030
<v Speaker 3>you get someone to talk for long periods</v>
<v Speaker 3>of time uncensored like that.</v>

2368
01:47:30.031 --> 01:47:31.950
<v Speaker 3>Without commercial breaks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>without moderators.</v>

2369
01:47:31.951 --> 01:47:36.951
<v Speaker 3>Then you're going to get to see him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These debates that they have are so </v>

2370
01:47:36.951 --> 01:47:39.591
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One person says something ridiculous to </v>

2371
01:47:39.591 --> 01:47:39.591
<v Speaker 3>see Bernie Sanders raising his hand when</v>
<v Speaker 3>he disagrees,</v>

2372
01:47:39.591 --> 01:47:44.270
<v Speaker 3>waiting to have his turn and then she's </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking over and then he talks over and </v>

2373
01:47:44.270 --> 01:47:46.380
<v Speaker 3>you're running out of time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but let me finish my point.</v>

2374
01:47:46.381 --> 01:47:46.950
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2375
01:47:46.990 --> 01:47:47.810
<v Speaker 3>it's like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2376
01:47:47.950 --> 01:47:51.660
<v Speaker 3>the method of distributing information </v>
<v Speaker 3>is archaic.</v>

2377
01:47:51.661 --> 01:47:53.600
<v Speaker 3>It's not necessary anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2378
01:47:53.610 --> 01:47:58.610
<v Speaker 3>they should,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they should have some sort of a free </v>

2379
01:47:58.610 --> 01:47:58.610
<v Speaker 3>form,</v>
<v Speaker 3>free form conversation.</v>

2380
01:47:58.610 --> 01:48:02.310
<v Speaker 3>It's available online where people can </v>
<v Speaker 3>watch it and you know,</v>

2381
01:48:02.311 --> 01:48:05.460
<v Speaker 3>you have someone who was entertaining </v>
<v Speaker 3>that understands politics,</v>

2382
01:48:05.730 --> 01:48:10.070
<v Speaker 3>run them through it and just give some </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of a,</v>

2383
01:48:10.200 --> 01:48:15.200
<v Speaker 3>a real detailed view to the American </v>
<v Speaker 3>people of who these people are and what </v>

2384
01:48:15.850 --> 01:48:20.850
<v Speaker 3>they're about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think they're the people that are </v>

2385
01:48:20.850 --> 01:48:20.850
<v Speaker 3>today.</v>

2386
01:48:20.850 --> 01:48:23.790
<v Speaker 3>Even Bernie Sanders who's a really </v>
<v Speaker 3>revolutionary and a lot of ways and very</v>

2387
01:48:23.791 --> 01:48:26.970
<v Speaker 3>progressive in a lot of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's still a politician,</v>

2388
01:48:27.110 --> 01:48:32.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's still wearing a tie and a suit and </v>

2389
01:48:32.110 --> 01:48:33.951
<v Speaker 3>all that nonsense and he's still a part </v>
<v Speaker 3>of this weird system and he always has </v>

2390
01:48:33.951 --> 01:48:37.401
<v Speaker 3>been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though he's a rebel in a lot of </v>

2391
01:48:37.401 --> 01:48:39.801
<v Speaker 3>ways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think they're going to be like </v>

2392
01:48:39.801 --> 01:48:39.801
<v Speaker 3>those people that are wearing powdered </v>
<v Speaker 3>wigs and those ancient pictures.</v>

2393
01:48:39.801 --> 01:48:42.090
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's so old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so crazy.</v>

2394
01:48:42.091 --> 01:48:45.390
<v Speaker 3>Like this method of doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you have to do it this way.</v>

2395
01:48:45.780 --> 01:48:48.210
<v Speaker 1>Lawyers in Australia as to where those </v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks do they really?</v>

2396
01:48:48.560 --> 01:48:51.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy what?</v>

2397
01:48:51.660 --> 01:48:54.680
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you do it's magic.</v>

2398
01:48:55.200 --> 01:48:56.940
<v Speaker 1>So if you go to court,</v>

<v Speaker 1>A lot of them think it's,</v>

2412
01:49:39.870 --> 01:49:41.340
<v Speaker 1>it's not a magistrate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a barrister.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Good Lord.</v>

<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

2416
01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:46.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually,</v>

2417
01:49:46.921 --> 01:49:48.100
<v Speaker 1>I went to court for the first time</v>

2418
01:49:48.460 --> 01:49:51.310
<v Speaker 2>last year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First time for what?</v>

2419
01:49:51.630 --> 01:49:54.220
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a charged with being a terrorist.</v>

2420
01:49:54.670 --> 01:49:59.670
<v Speaker 2>You did for something environmental?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine not.</v>

2421
01:50:00.190 --> 01:50:01.930
<v Speaker 2>What'd you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I uh,</v>

2422
01:50:01.931 --> 01:50:05.440
<v Speaker 2>I went through airport security with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>pocket knife by accident.</v>

2423
01:50:05.890 --> 01:50:07.090
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2424
01:50:07.091 --> 01:50:12.091
<v Speaker 2>We in Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're a bit of a nanny state at the </v>

2425
01:50:12.091 --> 01:50:12.091
<v Speaker 2>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2426
01:50:12.091 --> 01:50:14.991
<v Speaker 2>we've brought in a lot of laws that just</v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous and so it used to be you go </v>

2427
01:50:14.991 --> 01:50:16.660
<v Speaker 2>through airport security with your Swiss</v>
<v Speaker 2>army knife,</v>

2428
01:50:16.960 --> 01:50:21.280
<v Speaker 2>they take it off you and they go right </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a way you go,</v>

2429
01:50:21.340 --> 01:50:22.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

2430
01:50:22.660 --> 01:50:25.480
<v Speaker 2>They changed the law two weeks before I </v>
<v Speaker 2>went through and it was just,</v>

2431
01:50:25.510 --> 01:50:30.510
<v Speaker 2>it was just a random mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a pocket knife in with the camera </v>

2432
01:50:30.510 --> 01:50:30.510
<v Speaker 2>gear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to rearrange my bank because I was</v>

2433
01:50:30.510 --> 01:50:31.520
<v Speaker 2>overweight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2434
01:50:32.500 --> 01:50:34.240
<v Speaker 2>and I put it in my carry on by mistake.</v>

2435
01:50:34.240 --> 01:50:36.370
<v Speaker 2>I didn't realize that pocket knife is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's simple mistake.</v>

2436
01:50:36.371 --> 01:50:39.010
<v Speaker 2>We do it all the time and people do it </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the time.</v>

2437
01:50:39.310 --> 01:50:40.300
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2438
01:50:40.360 --> 01:50:42.370
<v Speaker 2>so they got it and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh crap,</v>

2439
01:50:42.400 --> 01:50:43.600
<v Speaker 2>because it's a good knife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2440
01:50:43.950 --> 01:50:44.480
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2441
01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:46.360
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm late for my flight.</v>

2442
01:50:46.361 --> 01:50:47.440
<v Speaker 2>And then I went to walk away and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>went,</v>

2443
01:50:47.441 --> 01:50:49.630
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hang on here when the Australian Federal</v>

2444
01:50:49.630 --> 01:50:50.650
<v Speaker 2>Police need to speak to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2445
01:50:50.680 --> 01:50:53.590
<v Speaker 2>oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the police came over and they were,</v>

2446
01:50:53.620 --> 01:50:58.620
<v Speaker 2>they were trying to give me off on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>course and they were ringing their </v>

2447
01:50:58.620 --> 01:50:58.810
<v Speaker 2>superior and trying to get me caught </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I could see clear as day that is</v>

2448
01:50:58.811 --> 01:51:02.290
<v Speaker 2>just stupid mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the supplier said,</v>

2449
01:51:02.291 --> 01:51:02.590
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2450
01:51:02.620 --> 01:51:04.960
<v Speaker 2>that's the laws change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to go to court now.</v>

2451
01:51:05.290 --> 01:51:09.730
<v Speaker 2>And so I was charged with possession of </v>
<v Speaker 2>a deadly weapon basically with intent to</v>

2452
01:51:09.760 --> 01:51:14.760
<v Speaker 2>hijack and aircraft and it cost me </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of dollars because it wasn't </v>

2453
01:51:15.880 --> 01:51:18.070
<v Speaker 2>the airport I got done.</v>

2454
01:51:18.070 --> 01:51:21.100
<v Speaker 2>It was about 2000 kilometers away from </v>
<v Speaker 2>where I live.</v>

2455
01:51:21.101 --> 01:51:24.670
<v Speaker 2>So I had to travel back there and then I</v>
<v Speaker 2>had to get a lawyer,</v>

2456
01:51:24.671 --> 01:51:27.190
<v Speaker 2>which was just hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I pay a thousand dollars.</v>

2457
01:51:27.191 --> 01:51:29.230
<v Speaker 2>He didn't even show up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He sent someone else,</v>

2458
01:51:29.260 --> 01:51:31.520
<v Speaker 2>gave me a call half an hour beforehand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2459
01:51:32.340 --> 01:51:33.700
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything was just like.</v>

2460
01:51:34.150 --> 01:51:36.430
<v Speaker 2>And so I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew more about the law than he did.</v>

2461
01:51:36.431 --> 01:51:39.640
<v Speaker 2>But anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then the substitute lawyer?</v>

2462
01:51:39.850 --> 01:51:41.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>

2463
01:51:41.081 --> 01:51:42.550
<v Speaker 2>I knew more about the actual </v>
<v Speaker 2>legislation.</v>

2464
01:51:42.551 --> 01:51:47.551
<v Speaker 2>I was getting challenged and basically I</v>
<v Speaker 2>got the legislation has no difference </v>

2465
01:51:47.551 --> 01:51:49.870
<v Speaker 2>between a bazooka and a in a pocket </v>
<v Speaker 2>knife that the same thing.</v>

2466
01:51:49.900 --> 01:51:52.440
<v Speaker 2>Ak Forty seven and it's the same thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the.</v>

2467
01:51:52.640 --> 01:51:54.170
<v Speaker 2>You kill somebody with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If.</v>

2468
01:51:54.240 --> 01:51:55.720
<v Speaker 2>So it's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the same thing.</v>

2469
01:51:55.840 --> 01:51:57.880
<v Speaker 2>If I try to get through airport security</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a bazooka,</v>

2470
01:51:57.881 --> 01:52:00.580
<v Speaker 2>I'd be under the same legislation and </v>
<v Speaker 2>under the same thing.</v>

2471
01:52:00.940 --> 01:52:03.310
<v Speaker 2>And so I got off lightly instead of get </v>
<v Speaker 2>used in jail.</v>

2472
01:52:03.360 --> 01:52:05.470
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because obviously first offense,</v>

2473
01:52:05.471 --> 01:52:08.020
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no prior record or that sort of stuff.</v>

2474
01:52:08.080 --> 01:52:10.960
<v Speaker 2>I got a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a fancy word for it.</v>

2475
01:52:11.200 --> 01:52:13.260
<v Speaker 2>I want to say indentured servitude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not it.</v>

2476
01:52:13.280 --> 01:52:16.300
<v Speaker 2>It's like a good behavior bond.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I got four for the next year.</v>

2477
01:52:16.301 --> 01:52:17.710
<v Speaker 2>As long as you don't break any more </v>
<v Speaker 2>laws,</v>

2478
01:52:17.740 --> 01:52:19.930
<v Speaker 2>then that conviction will disappear </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically.</v>

2479
01:52:20.020 --> 01:52:21.310
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

2480
01:52:21.311 --> 01:52:26.311
<v Speaker 2>I went to court,</v>
<v Speaker 2>charged with being a terrorist for </v>

2481
01:52:26.311 --> 01:52:26.311
<v Speaker 2>bloody pocket knife and that's when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>must have been after that.</v>

2482
01:52:26.311 --> 01:52:30.931
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't really want to live in </v>

2483
01:52:30.931 --> 01:52:30.931
<v Speaker 2>Australia anymore because it's just </v>
<v Speaker 2>gotten a bit too crazy.</v>

2484
01:52:30.931 --> 01:52:35.110
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that's the same sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>momentum that's behind,</v>

2485
01:52:35.111 --> 01:52:40.111
<v Speaker 2>like getting rid of the immigrants and </v>
<v Speaker 2>shipping them off to new places and </v>

2486
01:52:40.111 --> 01:52:40.260
<v Speaker 2>putting people in jail for reporting on </v>
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>

2487
01:52:40.300 --> 01:52:45.300
<v Speaker 2>Least have some thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Patriot Act where they bring in a law </v>

2488
01:52:45.300 --> 01:52:45.890
<v Speaker 2>that does all this sort of stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't debate.</v>

2489
01:52:46.230 --> 01:52:51.230
<v Speaker 2>It just goes instantly through and no </v>
<v Speaker 2>one even reads the law of what's going </v>

2490
01:52:51.230 --> 01:52:55.211
<v Speaker 2>through and we had this whole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was so staged if so easily you could </v>

2491
01:52:55.211 --> 01:52:59.471
<v Speaker 2>see was staged where they had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've arrested 20 terrorists in Sydney </v>

2492
01:52:59.471 --> 01:53:03.880
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They actually had to let them all go </v>

2493
01:53:03.880 --> 01:53:05.800
<v Speaker 2>because they didn't have anything on </v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone but they filmed it and it was on </v>

2494
01:53:05.800 --> 01:53:08.390
<v Speaker 2>national news of them writing all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>places and then immediately brought in a</v>

2495
01:53:08.390 --> 01:53:10.520
<v Speaker 2>week later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>new laws and that no one debated.</v>

2496
01:53:10.560 --> 01:53:13.300
<v Speaker 2>No one even written brought him in and </v>
<v Speaker 2>one of those laws were,</v>

2497
01:53:13.380 --> 01:53:18.380
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you take a pocket knife through airport </v>

2498
01:53:18.380 --> 01:53:20.051
<v Speaker 2>security.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to go to court to defend </v>

2499
01:53:20.051 --> 01:53:20.051
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's such a stupid.</v>

2500
01:53:20.051 --> 01:53:22.880
<v Speaker 3>With law,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the United States laws which are </v>

2501
01:53:22.880 --> 01:53:25.641
<v Speaker 3>pretty strict or nothing like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went through security accidentally </v>

2502
01:53:25.641 --> 01:53:25.641
<v Speaker 3>with a pocketknife they just took,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it</v>

2503
01:53:25.710 --> 01:53:26.950
<v Speaker 2>was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone does this,</v>

2504
01:53:26.951 --> 01:53:29.010
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just spend 3000,</v>

2505
01:53:29.011 --> 01:53:34.011
<v Speaker 2>$4,000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>million money and try and work this out </v>

2506
01:53:34.011 --> 01:53:35.950
<v Speaker 2>that way and now to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whenever I travel my bags,</v>

2507
01:53:35.980 --> 01:53:40.980
<v Speaker 2>if I have a short short transit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my bags went make it because they get </v>

2508
01:53:41.021 --> 01:53:43.120
<v Speaker 2>searched every single a protocol on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>list.</v>

2509
01:53:44.010 --> 01:53:46.600
<v Speaker 2>I just spent three weeks in Antarctica </v>
<v Speaker 2>with no luggage.</v>

2510
01:53:47.500 --> 01:53:48.520
<v Speaker 2>It never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it never arrived.</v>

2511
01:53:48.550 --> 01:53:53.550
<v Speaker 2>Oh Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it went through extra security </v>

2512
01:53:53.550 --> 01:53:56.491
<v Speaker 2>in and then didn't arrive for a couple </v>
<v Speaker 2>of days and I was already down in </v>

2513
01:53:56.491 --> 01:53:56.491
<v Speaker 2>Antarctica</v>

2514
01:53:57.270 --> 01:53:59.830
<v Speaker 3>just because of a pocket knife just </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of a pocket knife.</v>

2515
01:54:00.040 --> 01:54:01.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in America.</v>

2516
01:54:01.141 --> 01:54:05.910
<v Speaker 3>I went through it in Denver.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a backpack and the backpack in one</v>

2517
01:54:05.911 --> 01:54:10.911
<v Speaker 3>of the small pockets that are very small</v>
<v Speaker 3>knife in it and they sent me through </v>

2518
01:54:10.911 --> 01:54:14.991
<v Speaker 3>secondary screening was I think you got </v>
<v Speaker 3>a pocket knife in your backpack or </v>

2519
01:54:14.991 --> 01:54:16.170
<v Speaker 3>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy took it and that was it.</v>

2520
01:54:16.530 --> 01:54:17.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take it easy.</v>

2521
01:54:17.610 --> 01:54:18.360
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bye.</v>

2522
01:54:18.840 --> 01:54:20.700
<v Speaker 3>Done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it's always been locked,</v>

2523
01:54:20.701 --> 01:54:22.860
<v Speaker 3>but they changed the law.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's so crazy.</v>

2524
01:54:23.100 --> 01:54:24.670
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't make any sense at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

2525
01:54:24.780 --> 01:54:27.280
<v Speaker 3>it's a waste of my money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a waste of the court's money.</v>

2526
01:54:27.600 --> 01:54:32.600
<v Speaker 3>What do you think they're doing it to </v>
<v Speaker 3>try to make more money by making more </v>

2527
01:54:32.600 --> 01:54:32.600
<v Speaker 3>court cases?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2528
01:54:32.600 --> 01:54:33.420
<v Speaker 3>I had to pay the court costs.</v>

2529
01:54:34.140 --> 01:54:36.020
<v Speaker 2>I mean obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

2530
01:54:36.510 --> 01:54:39.240
<v Speaker 2>I just think it's Laura upon laws in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Australia,</v>

2531
01:54:39.241 --> 01:54:42.360
<v Speaker 2>we are shocking at laws upon laws and </v>
<v Speaker 2>laws.</v>

2532
01:54:44.260 --> 01:54:49.260
<v Speaker 2>No one speeds in Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I drove down from San Francisco </v>

2533
01:54:49.260 --> 01:54:52.231
<v Speaker 2>yesterday and it was ludicrous how fast </v>
<v Speaker 2>people would drive the speed limit </v>

2534
01:54:52.231 --> 01:54:56.600
<v Speaker 2>because the speed that they were driving</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 40 k's over the speed limit is </v>

2535
01:54:56.600 --> 01:54:57.570
<v Speaker 2>something that in Australia is you lose </v>
<v Speaker 2>your license instantly.</v>

2536
01:54:57.600 --> 01:54:59.070
<v Speaker 2>You don't have a license for the next </v>
<v Speaker 2>year,</v>

2537
01:54:59.150 --> 01:54:59.990
<v Speaker 2>so really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2538
01:54:59.991 --> 01:55:03.720
<v Speaker 2>So no one's speeds like that for a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>

2539
01:55:04.140 --> 01:55:09.140
<v Speaker 2>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's because we just have so many </v>

2540
01:55:09.140 --> 01:55:11.991
<v Speaker 2>laws.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just have so many different laws in </v>

2541
01:55:11.991 --> 01:55:11.991
<v Speaker 2>that respect.</v>

2542
01:55:11.991 --> 01:55:16.570
<v Speaker 3>That's disturbing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's not what I wanted to talk to </v>

2543
01:55:16.570 --> 01:55:16.570
<v Speaker 3>you about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Men bumming me out about Australia.</v>

2544
01:55:16.570 --> 01:55:17.750
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking about moving to </v>
<v Speaker 3>Australia.</v>

2545
01:55:17.751 --> 01:55:18.830
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe that's the spot.</v>

2546
01:55:19.190 --> 01:55:22.370
<v Speaker 3>I've heard that a lot from the American </v>
<v Speaker 3>since trump is doing his thing.</v>

2547
01:55:22.480 --> 01:55:23.750
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not because of that.</v>

2548
01:55:23.810 --> 01:55:27.350
<v Speaker 3>I just think I just like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I wouldn't really move there,</v>

2549
01:55:27.351 --> 01:55:32.351
<v Speaker 3>but like if the shit hit the fan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone blew up Manhattan or something </v>

2550
01:55:32.351 --> 01:55:32.351
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2551
01:55:32.351 --> 01:55:33.290
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>time of jolt or bolt,</v>

2552
01:55:33.530 --> 01:55:34.520
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is.</v>

2553
01:55:34.910 --> 01:55:38.150
<v Speaker 2>That's an interesting one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where I was for nine slash 11.</v>

2554
01:55:38.860 --> 01:55:42.950
<v Speaker 2>Where were you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in up in the very northern reaches</v>

2555
01:55:42.951 --> 01:55:44.250
<v Speaker 2>of Australia in the middle of nowhere.</v>

2556
01:55:44.580 --> 01:55:48.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm so far away that you couldn't get </v>
<v Speaker 1>any signal for anything,</v>

2557
01:55:48.780 --> 01:55:52.680
<v Speaker 1>but one of the people on board had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>shortwave radio,</v>

2558
01:55:52.681 --> 01:55:57.681
<v Speaker 1>like a ham radio and so I learned of </v>
<v Speaker 1>nine slash 11 via radio and it was like </v>

2559
01:55:57.681 --> 01:56:02.240
<v Speaker 1>war of the worlds man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounded like the whole world was </v>

2560
01:56:02.240 --> 01:56:05.510
<v Speaker 1>going to shine and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we were on a boat in the middle of </v>

2561
01:56:05.510 --> 01:56:05.510
<v Speaker 1>nowhere and we did kind of just all </v>
<v Speaker 1>looked at each other and go,</v>

2562
01:56:05.510 --> 01:56:08.130
<v Speaker 1>well we got two or three months supply </v>
<v Speaker 1>of food here.</v>

2563
01:56:08.131 --> 01:56:11.400
<v Speaker 1>We can stretch that out with fishing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're in the middle of nowhere.</v>

2564
01:56:11.401 --> 01:56:13.860
<v Speaker 1>We can go sit up that creek over there </v>
<v Speaker 1>and yeah,</v>

2565
01:56:13.890 --> 01:56:18.890
<v Speaker 1>we were kind of pretty bugged out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't until about two months later </v>

2566
01:56:18.890 --> 01:56:18.990
<v Speaker 1>they actually got back and saw the </v>
<v Speaker 1>images of what happened.</v>

2567
01:56:19.530 --> 01:56:24.530
<v Speaker 1>But it sounds like war of the worlds </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you listened to that sort of event </v>

2568
01:56:24.530 --> 01:56:25.500
<v Speaker 1>over a radio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was scary.</v>

2569
01:56:25.980 --> 01:56:28.140
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird way to get information </v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

2570
01:56:28.200 --> 01:56:30.690
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so like retro,</v>

2571
01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:36.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get information about some sort of a </v>

2572
01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:39.710
<v Speaker 1>gigantic catastrophe or calamity </v>
<v Speaker 1>horrendous event.</v>

2573
01:56:41.370 --> 01:56:45.000
<v Speaker 1>Like nine slash 11 to get an over radio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like just,</v>

2574
01:56:45.120 --> 01:56:50.120
<v Speaker 1>it sounded like world war three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it sounded like from the </v>

2575
01:56:50.120 --> 01:56:50.450
<v Speaker 1>radio at least.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2576
01:56:50.460 --> 01:56:55.460
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it looked like world war three on </v>

2577
01:56:55.460 --> 01:56:55.460
<v Speaker 1>tv that day too though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in all fairness.</v>

2578
01:56:55.460 --> 01:57:00.050
<v Speaker 1>I remember watching on TV and went with </v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of my friends because there was </v>

2579
01:57:00.050 --> 01:57:02.330
<v Speaker 1>no flights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had some gigs planned.</v>

2580
01:57:02.340 --> 01:57:07.340
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So actually supposed to be in Manhattan </v>

2581
01:57:07.340 --> 01:57:07.340
<v Speaker 1>that week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lucky.</v>

2582
01:57:07.340 --> 01:57:07.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2583
01:57:07.951 --> 01:57:12.300
<v Speaker 1>I was supposed to fly to Manhattan the </v>
<v Speaker 1>week after September 11 that all flights</v>

2584
01:57:12.301 --> 01:57:16.290
<v Speaker 1>were canceled and I remember hanging out</v>
<v Speaker 1>with some friends in La and everyone was</v>

2585
01:57:16.291 --> 01:57:21.291
<v Speaker 1>bugging out like why is going to happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we were aware because of the </v>

2586
01:57:21.291 --> 01:57:23.550
<v Speaker 1>news that there was no flights and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a beautiful,</v>

2587
01:57:23.551 --> 01:57:24.270
<v Speaker 1>clear skies.</v>

2588
01:57:24.290 --> 01:57:26.100
<v Speaker 1>It was strange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strange.</v>

2589
01:57:26.101 --> 01:57:27.750
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look up like there's no,</v>

2590
01:57:28.170 --> 01:57:29.670
<v Speaker 1>no airplanes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2591
01:57:29.760 --> 01:57:31.260
<v Speaker 1>just nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't hear him.</v>

2592
01:57:31.410 --> 01:57:32.820
<v Speaker 1>You look up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't see any.</v>

2593
01:57:33.210 --> 01:57:36.300
<v Speaker 1>I think it was some of the clear skies </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever recorded over the USA.</v>

2594
01:57:36.310 --> 01:57:37.380
<v Speaker 1>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2595
01:57:37.381 --> 01:57:38.160
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only that,</v>

2596
01:57:38.161 --> 01:57:43.161
<v Speaker 1>the temperature lowered changed the </v>
<v Speaker 1>temperature of the earth or maybe </v>

2597
01:57:43.161 --> 01:57:45.540
<v Speaker 1>raised,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget one of the water vapor.</v>

2598
01:57:45.541 --> 01:57:46.740
<v Speaker 1>It would've lowered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2599
01:57:46.750 --> 01:57:48.600
<v Speaker 1>it would've got a little bit cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is?</v>

2600
01:57:48.970 --> 01:57:53.260
<v Speaker 1>Because things happened and we'll either</v>
<v Speaker 1>raised or lowered depending upon the.</v>

2601
01:57:53.310 --> 01:57:57.780
<v Speaker 1>There was also the water vapor could </v>
<v Speaker 1>protect the atmosphere and a lot because</v>

2602
01:57:57.781 --> 01:57:59.030
<v Speaker 1>it's like cloud cover,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2603
01:57:59.040 --> 01:58:01.740
<v Speaker 1>when you get contrary contracts on which</v>
<v Speaker 1>one it was,</v>

2604
01:58:01.741 --> 01:58:06.741
<v Speaker 1>but it was like a noticeable amount that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it changed a CEO to an airplane's </v>

2605
01:58:06.741 --> 01:58:07.630
<v Speaker 1>pumping out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's nothing too serious.</v>

2606
01:58:07.631 --> 01:58:11.400
<v Speaker 1>This is one of the most efficient forms </v>
<v Speaker 1>of transport you can have put person,</v>

2607
01:58:11.910 --> 01:58:15.370
<v Speaker 1>but where it's injecting that CEO too </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that water vapor up in that,</v>

2608
01:58:15.420 --> 01:58:17.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the high atmosphere it's,</v>

2609
01:58:17.630 --> 01:58:18.900
<v Speaker 1>it's doing some damage.</v>

2610
01:58:18.930 --> 01:58:21.350
<v Speaker 1>It is not as much as I think we give it </v>
<v Speaker 1>credit for.</v>

2611
01:58:21.960 --> 01:58:25.940
<v Speaker 1>Well the other thing is people that live</v>
<v Speaker 1>near airports suffer some sick.</v>

2612
01:58:25.950 --> 01:58:27.300
<v Speaker 1>What does that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie would just put up.</v>

2613
01:58:27.660 --> 01:58:29.090
<v Speaker 1>It got hotter actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2614
01:58:29.120 --> 01:58:33.660
<v Speaker 1>Did two degrees hotter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2615
01:58:33.661 --> 01:58:36.240
<v Speaker 1>That's what I was thinking because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think is the lack of.</v>

2616
01:58:36.940 --> 01:58:41.940
<v Speaker 1>Because those trails that are created,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the artificial clouds that are by jet </v>

2617
01:58:41.940 --> 01:58:44.380
<v Speaker 1>engines naturally stirring up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>humidity.</v>

2618
01:58:44.870 --> 01:58:47.800
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they're reflecting back solar </v>
<v Speaker 1>radiation.</v>

2619
01:58:47.860 --> 01:58:51.040
<v Speaker 1>Well that's where all the chem trail </v>
<v Speaker 1>craziness comes from.</v>

2620
01:58:51.130 --> 01:58:56.130
<v Speaker 1>The geoengineering people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they believe that that is actually done </v>

2621
01:58:56.130 --> 01:58:57.010
<v Speaker 1>on purpose and then what we're doing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

2622
01:58:57.280 --> 01:59:00.460
<v Speaker 1>we're making artificial clouds try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>control the environment.</v>

2623
01:59:00.461 --> 01:59:01.720
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not true.</v>

2624
01:59:02.350 --> 01:59:05.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean we know why those things are </v>
<v Speaker 1>made.</v>

2625
01:59:05.260 --> 01:59:10.260
<v Speaker 1>They're made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a natural formation that happens </v>

2626
01:59:10.260 --> 01:59:10.260
<v Speaker 1>when you have a jet engine passes </v>
<v Speaker 1>through condensation.</v>

2627
01:59:10.260 --> 01:59:11.930
<v Speaker 1>It creates contract is not chem trails.</v>

2628
01:59:12.020 --> 01:59:14.100
<v Speaker 1>I always try and point that one out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

2629
01:59:14.400 --> 01:59:19.400
<v Speaker 1>there's a guy named Mick West who runs </v>
<v Speaker 1>this website called Metta bunk and just </v>

2630
01:59:19.400 --> 01:59:24.160
<v Speaker 1>sort of debunks a lot of like really </v>
<v Speaker 1>commonly held ideas that conspiracy </v>

2631
01:59:24.160 --> 01:59:28.261
<v Speaker 1>theories tend to grab onto,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he calls it the training wheels of </v>

2632
01:59:28.261 --> 01:59:28.930
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy theories because it's like in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sky above your head.</v>

2633
01:59:28.931 --> 01:59:30.370
<v Speaker 1>Like what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>

2634
01:59:30.371 --> 01:59:31.940
<v Speaker 1>we've got to get to the bottom of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2635
01:59:32.020 --> 01:59:37.020
<v Speaker 1>and that's sort of where instead of like</v>
<v Speaker 1>researching what actually happens with </v>

2636
01:59:37.020 --> 01:59:40.180
<v Speaker 1>jet engines and condensation and it on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people say,</v>

2637
01:59:40.181 --> 01:59:45.181
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how come one day there'll be no </v>

2638
01:59:45.181 --> 01:59:45.181
<v Speaker 1>cantrell's and another dude will be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot.</v>

2639
01:59:45.181 --> 01:59:49.411
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how come one day it rains and the other </v>

2640
01:59:49.411 --> 01:59:49.411
<v Speaker 1>day it doesn't really fit you really </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

2641
01:59:49.411 --> 01:59:50.890
<v Speaker 1>It's condensation and it's how the </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of moisture in the atmosphere.</v>

2642
01:59:50.891 --> 01:59:53.350
<v Speaker 1>It's whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a different subject.</v>

2643
01:59:53.580 --> 01:59:55.870
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to talk to you about some other</v>

2644
01:59:55.871 --> 01:59:57.200
<v Speaker 1>shit that you had on your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2645
01:59:57.430 --> 02:00:02.430
<v Speaker 1>you had a neurological decompression </v>
<v Speaker 1>illness from you.</v>

2646
02:00:02.720 --> 02:00:05.170
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to give a happy here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is actually getting sad.</v>

2647
02:00:05.380 --> 02:00:06.880
<v Speaker 1>Well this is scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2648
02:00:06.920 --> 02:00:08.380
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a story.</v>

2649
02:00:08.381 --> 02:00:09.610
<v Speaker 1>I was hoping you're going to do another </v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

2650
02:00:09.740 --> 02:00:11.320
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's certainly we can do that.</v>

2651
02:00:11.440 --> 02:00:13.960
<v Speaker 1>We don't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to tell you it's just,</v>

2652
02:00:13.961 --> 02:00:16.810
<v Speaker 1>it's a depressing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depressing what happened.</v>

2653
02:00:17.290 --> 02:00:21.460
<v Speaker 1>So I'm scuba diving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scuba diving since I was 12 years old,</v>

2654
02:00:21.780 --> 02:00:25.160
<v Speaker 1>a $13,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm asking a lot of time underwater.</v>

2655
02:00:25.450 --> 02:00:26.740
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2656
02:00:27.070 --> 02:00:28.820
<v Speaker 1>so one light sites inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2657
02:00:29.020 --> 02:00:32.260
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I was diving nothing too serious,</v>

2658
02:00:32.261 --> 02:00:33.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a shallow dive.</v>

2659
02:00:33.610 --> 02:00:35.560
<v Speaker 1>It was a bit of a car and I was turning </v>
<v Speaker 1>into a bit of a current,</v>

2660
02:00:36.340 --> 02:00:38.620
<v Speaker 1>maybe slightly dehydrated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>

2661
02:00:38.660 --> 02:00:39.880
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

2662
02:00:40.090 --> 02:00:45.090
<v Speaker 1>I got messed up now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been diving for nine days prior to </v>

2663
02:00:45.090 --> 02:00:45.820
<v Speaker 1>that full dives a day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'd had some residual nitrogen.</v>

2664
02:00:45.821 --> 02:00:48.910
<v Speaker 1>I've got bubbles in my blood basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then doing this one,</v>

2665
02:00:48.970 --> 02:00:51.700
<v Speaker 1>I guess a little bit of exertion </v>
<v Speaker 1>underwater and stuff like that.</v>

2666
02:00:52.180 --> 02:00:53.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got messed up.</v>

2667
02:00:53.021 --> 02:00:57.640
<v Speaker 1>So when I came out of the water you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bad headache and stuff like that.</v>

2668
02:00:57.670 --> 02:01:02.670
<v Speaker 1>And then um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually I was looking down at my </v>

2669
02:01:02.670 --> 02:01:06.250
<v Speaker 1>hands and my hands had gone into Phis </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I couldn't open my hands anymore.</v>

2670
02:01:06.520 --> 02:01:09.490
<v Speaker 1>And that to me was the big thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>straight away I was like,</v>

2671
02:01:09.491 --> 02:01:14.491
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never had that before where I </v>

2672
02:01:14.491 --> 02:01:14.491
<v Speaker 1>didn't have control of my buddy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

2673
02:01:14.491 --> 02:01:19.180
<v Speaker 1>And so my hands were world class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I ran upstairs to my bunk,</v>

2674
02:01:19.210 --> 02:01:20.610
<v Speaker 1>told the first night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2675
02:01:20.620 --> 02:01:23.440
<v Speaker 1>get the oxygen and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got something's going wrong here.</v>

2676
02:01:23.920 --> 02:01:28.920
<v Speaker 1>And then when I laid down in my bunk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just severe pain going over the whole </v>

2677
02:01:28.920 --> 02:01:32.410
<v Speaker 1>entire body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arms enhance both totally paralyzed.</v>

2678
02:01:32.440 --> 02:01:35.890
<v Speaker 1>Couldn't move them enormous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enormous amount of pain.</v>

2679
02:01:35.990 --> 02:01:40.990
<v Speaker 1>A box jellyfish pain or no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2680
02:01:41.351 --> 02:01:42.200
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing near that.</v>

2681
02:01:42.201 --> 02:01:43.110
<v Speaker 1>I think more discussion</v>

2682
02:01:43.180 --> 02:01:44.650
<v Speaker 2>paying because you just don't know </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on,</v>

2683
02:01:44.710 --> 02:01:45.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just don't know.</v>

2684
02:01:46.390 --> 02:01:49.180
<v Speaker 2>Your whole body is just suddenly doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff that it's never done before.</v>

2685
02:01:49.540 --> 02:01:54.540
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so when an oxygen and ended up </v>

2686
02:01:54.540 --> 02:01:54.990
<v Speaker 2>passing out actually after a few,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe half an hour.</v>

2687
02:01:54.991 --> 02:01:59.991
<v Speaker 2>So I ended up passing out and then woke </v>
<v Speaker 2>up and I was just really dopey and </v>

2688
02:01:59.991 --> 02:02:02.710
<v Speaker 2>doughy and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And long story short,</v>

2689
02:02:02.870 --> 02:02:07.870
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for various reasons I didn't actually </v>

2690
02:02:07.870 --> 02:02:09.130
<v Speaker 2>get treatment for about six days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was very remote area in this.</v>

2691
02:02:09.170 --> 02:02:14.170
<v Speaker 2>There's all this stuff there and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I spent nine days in a chamber </v>

2692
02:02:15.370 --> 02:02:20.370
<v Speaker 2>decompression chamber basically to try </v>
<v Speaker 2>and try and repair what had gone wrong </v>

2693
02:02:21.460 --> 02:02:26.460
<v Speaker 2>because I had nerve damage in the hands </v>
<v Speaker 2>and feet,</v>

2694
02:02:27.610 --> 02:02:32.610
<v Speaker 2>spine and brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I had quite a significant brand </v>

2695
02:02:32.610 --> 02:02:33.630
<v Speaker 2>damage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2696
02:02:33.760 --> 02:02:38.760
<v Speaker 2>the spine damage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the spine causes a lot of fatigue and </v>

2697
02:02:38.760 --> 02:02:41.551
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the hands and feet just pain </v>

2698
02:02:41.551 --> 02:02:41.551
<v Speaker 2>basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2699
02:02:41.551 --> 02:02:42.280
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that happened in 2012.</v>

2700
02:02:43.240 --> 02:02:44.860
<v Speaker 1>I got messed up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>messed up.</v>

2701
02:02:44.920 --> 02:02:47.470
<v Speaker 1>So brain damage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what kind of brain damage?</v>

2702
02:02:47.950 --> 02:02:51.490
<v Speaker 1>A literally brain damage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's going on in my body is lots of</v>

2703
02:02:51.491 --> 02:02:54.550
<v Speaker 1>little tiny bubbles basically are all </v>
<v Speaker 1>nerves,</v>

2704
02:02:54.551 --> 02:02:57.210
<v Speaker 1>bloodstream everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they cause inflammation and they,</v>

2705
02:02:57.320 --> 02:02:59.680
<v Speaker 1>they kill stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a lot of muscle atrophy,</v>

2706
02:02:59.700 --> 02:03:04.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a lot of muscles just die on me </v>

2707
02:03:04.700 --> 02:03:06.740
<v Speaker 1>cause they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their blood supply had been blocked by </v>

2708
02:03:06.740 --> 02:03:08.971
<v Speaker 1>these little bubbles going around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you see like a difference in your </v>

2709
02:03:08.971 --> 02:03:10.300
<v Speaker 1>body to turn black and blue or does it </v>
<v Speaker 1>shrink?</v>

2710
02:03:10.330 --> 02:03:11.590
<v Speaker 1>Like what you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you lose your,</v>

2711
02:03:11.600 --> 02:03:14.980
<v Speaker 1>all your muscle mass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just shrivels you lose your muscle mass.</v>

2712
02:03:14.981 --> 02:03:19.981
<v Speaker 1>It changed the appearance of the skin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like does it seem like yellowing where </v>

2713
02:03:19.981 --> 02:03:22.090
<v Speaker 1>it's rotting underneath or anything?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing like that.</v>

2714
02:03:22.110 --> 02:03:24.310
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to learn how to walk again.</v>

2715
02:03:24.350 --> 02:03:27.610
<v Speaker 1>I could barely walk and I had to learn.</v>

2716
02:03:27.640 --> 02:03:30.310
<v Speaker 1>Vocabulary was a hard one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said we're really good vocabulary now.</v>

2717
02:03:30.750 --> 02:03:32.490
<v Speaker 1>Not so much anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2718
02:03:32.660 --> 02:03:35.800
<v Speaker 1>I killed a lot of brain cells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brain cells,</v>

2719
02:03:36.040 --> 02:03:41.040
<v Speaker 1>you feel stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or I had,</v>

2720
02:03:44.070 --> 02:03:47.220
<v Speaker 1>I tested my Iq beforehand and I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>about 150,</v>

2721
02:03:47.221 --> 02:03:52.221
<v Speaker 1>160 marketing and now I'm about 120.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're still a fucking genius.</v>

2722
02:03:53.460 --> 02:03:56.080
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't go that far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some Iq points.</v>

2723
02:03:56.081 --> 02:03:56.690
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2724
02:03:56.710 --> 02:04:01.710
<v Speaker 1>you used to be a genius for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a photographic memory.</v>

2725
02:04:01.910 --> 02:04:04.090
<v Speaker 1>I won 51.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sixty is definitely a genius.</v>

2726
02:04:04.240 --> 02:04:09.240
<v Speaker 1>I thought too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically it's better for you to feel a </v>

2727
02:04:09.240 --> 02:04:09.240
<v Speaker 1>little stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So do you really?</v>

2739
02:04:35.970 --> 02:04:40.170
<v Speaker 1>Beverly Hills housewife?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My TV at home as an isn't actually </v>

2740
02:04:40.170 --> 02:04:40.170
<v Speaker 1>connected to an area little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2741
02:04:40.170 --> 02:04:43.200
<v Speaker 1>you're one of those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like advertising.</v>

2742
02:04:43.201 --> 02:04:48.201
<v Speaker 1>I think advertising is evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you use like Netflix or something </v>

2743
02:04:48.201 --> 02:04:48.201
<v Speaker 1>like that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's smart.</v>

2744
02:04:48.201 --> 02:04:48.750
<v Speaker 1>That's the future anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2745
02:04:48.930 --> 02:04:51.900
<v Speaker 1>You're ahead of the ball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything goods on itunes already,</v>

2746
02:04:52.110 --> 02:04:55.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the good shows in a walking dead</v>

2747
02:04:55.081 --> 02:04:56.430
<v Speaker 1>or game of thrones or anything like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2748
02:04:56.431 --> 02:04:58.770
<v Speaker 1>You could always find them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I want to choose my own schedule as</v>

2749
02:04:58.771 --> 02:05:00.090
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be,</v>

2750
02:05:00.120 --> 02:05:05.120
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wednesday night and I have to stay in </v>

2751
02:05:05.120 --> 02:05:05.120
<v Speaker 1>because I want to watch that one show.</v>

2752
02:05:05.120 --> 02:05:06.270
<v Speaker 1>Like my kids don't know what commercials</v>
<v Speaker 1>are really.</v>

2753
02:05:06.300 --> 02:05:09.270
<v Speaker 1>They don't understand it and most of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time we watch shows with them.</v>

2754
02:05:09.271 --> 02:05:12.150
<v Speaker 1>We watched on Dvr and you could fast </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward through commercials,</v>

2755
02:05:12.660 --> 02:05:17.660
<v Speaker 1>but occasionally we'll watch like one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>their favorite shows and it'll come on </v>

2756
02:05:17.660 --> 02:05:22.041
<v Speaker 1>and they'll watch it while it's on and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then the show will be on and then it'll </v>

2757
02:05:22.041 --> 02:05:24.050
<v Speaker 1>go to commercial and they reach for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>remote and it's like,</v>

2758
02:05:24.100 --> 02:05:29.100
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not letting them fast forward and </v>

2759
02:05:29.100 --> 02:05:29.520
<v Speaker 1>like what is going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like why do we have to watch this?</v>

2760
02:05:29.521 --> 02:05:30.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's a commercial.</v>

2761
02:05:30.691 --> 02:05:32.300
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how it normally is.</v>

2762
02:05:32.350 --> 02:05:37.350
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to what we had to deal with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the look on their little faces when </v>

2763
02:05:37.350 --> 02:05:38.700
<v Speaker 1>you see a little look on like a five or </v>
<v Speaker 1>six year old's face,</v>

2764
02:05:38.701 --> 02:05:41.050
<v Speaker 1>we were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck you I have to.</v>

2765
02:05:41.050 --> 02:05:46.050
<v Speaker 1>I have to watch this stupid thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're watching these commercials </v>

2766
02:05:46.050 --> 02:05:46.050
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like puzzled,</v>

2767
02:05:46.050 --> 02:05:50.751
<v Speaker 1>like who?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like even a child realizes this is a </v>

2768
02:05:50.751 --> 02:05:51.300
<v Speaker 1>dumb way to advertise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Advertise things.</v>

2769
02:05:51.420 --> 02:05:51.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2770
02:05:52.220 --> 02:05:57.220
<v Speaker 1>it's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it makes you not want to </v>

2771
02:05:57.220 --> 02:05:59.500
<v Speaker 1>purchase those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've interrupted your program,</v>

2772
02:05:59.750 --> 02:06:04.750
<v Speaker 1>but that's because you're intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say it does work for a vast </v>

2773
02:06:05.191 --> 02:06:07.510
<v Speaker 1>majority of people who don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2774
02:06:07.530 --> 02:06:09.540
<v Speaker 1>it's just subliminal than not even </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about it,</v>

2775
02:06:09.541 --> 02:06:10.470
<v Speaker 1>but it just goes in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2776
02:06:10.471 --> 02:06:15.471
<v Speaker 1>I want to cook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't you think it works less and less </v>

2777
02:06:15.471 --> 02:06:17.421
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Possibly as we get disassociated with </v>

2778
02:06:17.421 --> 02:06:21.921
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with Netflix and stuff like that as we </v>

2779
02:06:21.921 --> 02:06:21.921
<v Speaker 1>move away from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think,</v>

2780
02:06:21.921 --> 02:06:26.030
<v Speaker 1>I think advertising is evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Haven't seen the south park related </v>

2781
02:06:26.030 --> 02:06:26.030
<v Speaker 1>sandbox.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go onto it quite well,</v>

2782
02:06:26.030 --> 02:06:27.510
<v Speaker 1>but advertising,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2783
02:06:27.511 --> 02:06:30.240
<v Speaker 1>I see why it's there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

2784
02:06:31.080 --> 02:06:36.080
<v Speaker 1>it really bugs me and it bugs me </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably also because in Australia we </v>

2785
02:06:36.080 --> 02:06:36.080
<v Speaker 1>have such terrible ads.</v>

2786
02:06:36.600 --> 02:06:40.500
<v Speaker 1>We had Chris Bell and Mark Bell from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>documentary,</v>

2787
02:06:40.501 --> 02:06:41.130
<v Speaker 1>bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stronger,</v>

2788
02:06:41.131 --> 02:06:46.131
<v Speaker 1>faster and the new one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>prescription thugs where they go over </v>

2789
02:06:46.131 --> 02:06:49.911
<v Speaker 1>the effect of the prescription drug </v>
<v Speaker 1>industry and what massive influence it </v>

2790
02:06:49.911 --> 02:06:54.741
<v Speaker 1>has on people and the amount of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are hooked on pain pills and </v>

2791
02:06:54.741 --> 02:06:54.741
<v Speaker 1>whatnot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was bands in Australia by the way.</v>

2792
02:06:54.741 --> 02:06:58.790
<v Speaker 1>They should be and they were talking in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the documentary about during the Reagan </v>

2793
02:06:58.790 --> 02:07:02.961
<v Speaker 1>administration when they became legal </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they started advertising for all </v>

2794
02:07:02.961 --> 02:07:06.711
<v Speaker 1>these drugs and how how much different </v>
<v Speaker 1>the landscape changed when all of a </v>

2795
02:07:06.711 --> 02:07:10.950
<v Speaker 1>sudden there was an ad then showed you </v>
<v Speaker 1>all these things that may be you have an</v>

2796
02:07:10.951 --> 02:07:14.580
<v Speaker 1>issue and maybe you should talk to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>doctor about this stuff,</v>

2797
02:07:14.581 --> 02:07:16.500
<v Speaker 1>and then you know the sales go through </v>
<v Speaker 1>the roof.</v>

2798
02:07:16.501 --> 02:07:18.630
<v Speaker 1>They get addicted to that money that </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes from no sales.</v>

2799
02:07:19.110 --> 02:07:24.110
<v Speaker 1>It's a really disturbing aspect of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>society that you can advertise for drugs</v>

2800
02:07:24.600 --> 02:07:26.870
<v Speaker 1>like prescription.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many pharmaceuticals,</v>

2801
02:07:26.871 --> 02:07:31.260
<v Speaker 1>how many different drugs and American an</v>
<v Speaker 1>average American is on at any one point?</v>

2802
02:07:31.620 --> 02:07:33.840
<v Speaker 1>When I was in the dive industry as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>supervisor,</v>

2803
02:07:33.841 --> 02:07:36.280
<v Speaker 1>I would get lists of everyone on board</v>

2804
02:07:36.280 --> 02:07:41.280
<v Speaker 2>and their medical conditions and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs that are currently taking and </v>

2805
02:07:41.280 --> 02:07:41.280
<v Speaker 2>Australian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like,</v>

2806
02:07:41.280 --> 02:07:41.280
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep,</v>

2807
02:07:41.280 --> 02:07:41.790
<v Speaker 2>yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing,</v>

2808
02:07:42.050 --> 02:07:45.850
<v Speaker 2>nothing bump and American that have five</v>
<v Speaker 2>or six things listed there,</v>

2809
02:07:45.851 --> 02:07:50.851
<v Speaker 2>and then I would have to actually go do </v>
<v Speaker 2>the research on each drug and see if </v>

2810
02:07:50.851 --> 02:07:51.250
<v Speaker 2>they conflicted with diving and stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

2811
02:07:51.490 --> 02:07:53.290
<v Speaker 2>It was a lot of work and you kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2812
02:07:53.470 --> 02:07:58.470
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is an upper and this is a downer </v>

2813
02:07:58.470 --> 02:08:00.031
<v Speaker 2>and this is a kind of level or well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people of antidepressants and they have </v>

2814
02:08:01.750 --> 02:08:05.020
<v Speaker 2>an extra abilify that they add to an </v>
<v Speaker 2>antidepressant.</v>

2815
02:08:05.021 --> 02:08:06.760
<v Speaker 2>If that antidepressant isn't doing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>job,</v>

2816
02:08:07.360 --> 02:08:12.360
<v Speaker 2>but it could cause society a society to </v>
<v Speaker 2>collapse and your asshole explodes and </v>

2817
02:08:13.300 --> 02:08:16.420
<v Speaker 2>you bleed out and some side effects may </v>
<v Speaker 2>have suicidal thoughts.</v>

2818
02:08:16.710 --> 02:08:20.170
<v Speaker 2>It's apparently like there's a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>attached to it,</v>

2819
02:08:20.350 --> 02:08:24.850
<v Speaker 2>like the fine print at the end when they</v>
<v Speaker 2>scroll through it and may cause Mama,</v>

2820
02:08:25.060 --> 02:08:30.060
<v Speaker 2>it's like this huge list of </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibilities that could go horribly </v>

2821
02:08:30.060 --> 02:08:33.001
<v Speaker 2>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but some people they just always think </v>

2822
02:08:33.001 --> 02:08:35.851
<v Speaker 2>that a pill is the answer and I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's also part of the programming </v>

2823
02:08:35.851 --> 02:08:37.090
<v Speaker 2>that's sort of been in diamond.</v>

2824
02:08:37.270 --> 02:08:42.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm in a really tough spot this point in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the last few years basically because </v>

2825
02:08:42.270 --> 02:08:43.090
<v Speaker 2>I've always believed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't take a pill for the rest of you,</v>

2826
02:08:43.091 --> 02:08:44.620
<v Speaker 2>like take.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got a headache,</v>

2827
02:08:44.650 --> 02:08:49.650
<v Speaker 2>you take a headache pill route,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't take a pill every single </v>

2828
02:08:49.650 --> 02:08:49.650
<v Speaker 2>day of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no point for that.</v>

2829
02:08:49.660 --> 02:08:52.940
<v Speaker 2>Or you have something like diabetes or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something right to shop.</v>

2830
02:08:53.140 --> 02:08:56.050
<v Speaker 2>There's always some exceptions there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but lo and behold,</v>

2831
02:08:56.051 --> 02:09:01.051
<v Speaker 2>most people can actually with diabetes </v>
<v Speaker 2>even changed their diet and sort of go </v>

2832
02:09:01.051 --> 02:09:04.441
<v Speaker 2>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are ways to do without taking a </v>

2833
02:09:04.441 --> 02:09:05.110
<v Speaker 2>pill every day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now I'm under this thing where since</v>

2834
02:09:05.111 --> 02:09:06.700
<v Speaker 2>that accident with decompression </v>
<v Speaker 2>sickness,</v>

2835
02:09:06.820 --> 02:09:11.680
<v Speaker 2>I have pain constantly in pain </v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly.</v>

2836
02:09:11.800 --> 02:09:13.900
<v Speaker 2>What you're hiding it very well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2837
02:09:14.080 --> 02:09:15.850
<v Speaker 2>what do you do with your life?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just cry.</v>

2838
02:09:15.910 --> 02:09:18.040
<v Speaker 2>Go over there and cry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll hide in the corner.</v>

2839
02:09:19.560 --> 02:09:20.320
<v Speaker 2>But what are you gonna do?</v>

2840
02:09:20.320 --> 02:09:22.180
<v Speaker 2>Like what kind of pain is it like you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>in right now?</v>

2841
02:09:22.750 --> 02:09:27.750
<v Speaker 2>Hands and feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically the hands and feet are </v>

2842
02:09:27.750 --> 02:09:28.390
<v Speaker 2>throbbing or aching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stabbing pain feels like someone's got a</v>

2843
02:09:28.391 --> 02:09:33.391
<v Speaker 2>need right now and have a stabbing pain </v>
<v Speaker 2>in your hands and feet and you just </v>

2844
02:09:33.391 --> 02:09:33.391
<v Speaker 2>become accustomed to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2845
02:09:33.391 --> 02:09:34.000
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2846
02:09:34.060 --> 02:09:39.060
<v Speaker 2>It's all the nerve damage as you looked </v>
<v Speaker 2>into hypobaric hyperbaric chambers or </v>

2847
02:09:40.180 --> 02:09:43.060
<v Speaker 2>nine days straight after it happened to </v>
<v Speaker 2>barrick chambers.</v>

2848
02:09:43.400 --> 02:09:46.190
<v Speaker 2>So I did nine days in hyperbaric </v>
<v Speaker 2>chambers.</v>

2849
02:09:46.300 --> 02:09:48.890
<v Speaker 2>Looked into continue therapy with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2850
02:09:48.910 --> 02:09:51.280
<v Speaker 2>it's not something that'll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me tell you.</v>

2851
02:09:51.360 --> 02:09:53.230
<v Speaker 2>I would have to go pay for it myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2852
02:09:54.340 --> 02:09:57.510
<v Speaker 2>I'd have to pay thousands of dollars to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go get oxygen therapy for like,</v>

2853
02:09:57.730 --> 02:09:59.230
<v Speaker 2>football is football.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's go do it.</v>

2854
02:09:59.231 --> 02:10:04.231
<v Speaker 2>So they heal quicker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you actually talked to a doctor that </v>

2855
02:10:04.231 --> 02:10:07.401
<v Speaker 2>would say it probably wouldn't do much </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you do it after the event and </v>

2856
02:10:07.401 --> 02:10:07.401
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2857
02:10:07.401 --> 02:10:08.770
<v Speaker 2>But now we're talking four years later </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're like,</v>

2858
02:10:08.800 --> 02:10:10.210
<v Speaker 2>eh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably wouldn't do much.</v>

2859
02:10:10.211 --> 02:10:15.211
<v Speaker 2>But there's not a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem with decompression sickness </v>

2860
02:10:15.211 --> 02:10:15.340
<v Speaker 2>is there's not a lot of evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not a lot of research.</v>

2861
02:10:15.341 --> 02:10:19.000
<v Speaker 2>There is a holy per research,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's classified by the US marines,</v>

2862
02:10:19.990 --> 02:10:24.990
<v Speaker 2>US Navy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of the evidence and most of the </v>

2863
02:10:24.990 --> 02:10:24.990
<v Speaker 2>stuff out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very,</v>

2864
02:10:24.990 --> 02:10:27.070
<v Speaker 2>there's not a lot of data.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I remember going to these doctors</v>

2865
02:10:27.071 --> 02:10:29.020
<v Speaker 2>and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't really know.</v>

2866
02:10:29.440 --> 02:10:31.120
<v Speaker 2>How do you go?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no set plan.</v>

2867
02:10:31.150 --> 02:10:32.530
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get decompression sickness.</v>

2868
02:10:32.531 --> 02:10:34.160
<v Speaker 2>Where do we go from here to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to fix it?</v>

2869
02:10:34.490 --> 02:10:35.720
<v Speaker 2>There isn't that kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2870
02:10:35.721 --> 02:10:37.130
<v Speaker 2>we'll try this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll try this drug,</v>

2871
02:10:37.131 --> 02:10:42.131
<v Speaker 2>we'll try this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll try this drug and we'll just keep </v>

2872
02:10:42.131 --> 02:10:42.131
<v Speaker 2>trying different drugs and see what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens basically.</v>

2873
02:10:42.200 --> 02:10:44.750
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've tried a lot of drugs in the last 40</v>

2874
02:10:44.751 --> 02:10:45.020
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

2875
02:10:46.100 --> 02:10:49.290
<v Speaker 2>What has offered you the most relief?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2876
02:10:49.520 --> 02:10:53.530
<v Speaker 2>I'll get in trouble for saying it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But a acupuncture was actually with it.</v>

2877
02:10:53.550 --> 02:10:56.340
<v Speaker 2>You get in trouble for saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The anti acupuncture lobby,</v>

2878
02:10:57.980 --> 02:11:01.220
<v Speaker 2>basically I had to find some guy who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who kind of did it.</v>

2879
02:11:01.550 --> 02:11:04.610
<v Speaker 2>He was a doctor and then he did </v>
<v Speaker 2>acupuncture as we call it,</v>

2880
02:11:04.640 --> 02:11:07.190
<v Speaker 2>bulk billing is part of the government </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of thing so I could get it.</v>

2881
02:11:07.620 --> 02:11:12.620
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I did that and that reduced my pain </v>

2882
02:11:12.620 --> 02:11:13.010
<v Speaker 2>by about half a straight afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2883
02:11:13.100 --> 02:11:16.430
<v Speaker 2>huge thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other drugs I tried.</v>

2884
02:11:17.120 --> 02:11:17.990
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2885
02:11:18.170 --> 02:11:20.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean the names we'll kind of mix over </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

2886
02:11:20.571 --> 02:11:23.410
<v Speaker 2>So think the first thing they did is </v>
<v Speaker 2>they check you on any presence,</v>

2887
02:11:23.720 --> 02:11:25.730
<v Speaker 2>Cymbalta,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sort of stuff.</v>

2888
02:11:26.190 --> 02:11:27.380
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're like,</v>

2889
02:11:27.381 --> 02:11:32.381
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just having trouble adjusting to </v>

2890
02:11:32.381 --> 02:11:32.381
<v Speaker 2>the fact that he's in pain all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's give me an antidepressant.</v>

2891
02:11:32.381 --> 02:11:34.850
<v Speaker 2>So he's happy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which it does take the edge off,</v>

2892
02:11:35.300 --> 02:11:38.780
<v Speaker 2>but it's a kind of half against it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But B,</v>

2893
02:11:38.810 --> 02:11:41.120
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just had to keep upping the dose,</v>

2894
02:11:41.121 --> 02:11:46.121
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you started from 10 milligrams and then </v>

2895
02:11:46.121 --> 02:11:46.121
<v Speaker 2>in a month's time it wouldn't do </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything anymore.</v>

2896
02:11:46.121 --> 02:11:49.391
<v Speaker 2>You Go to 20 and you just keep upping </v>
<v Speaker 2>the dose and so you just become </v>

2897
02:11:49.391 --> 02:11:51.770
<v Speaker 2>accustomed to the dosage because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>not taking the pain away.</v>

2898
02:11:51.771 --> 02:11:53.140
<v Speaker 2>It's just taking the edge off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2899
02:11:53.150 --> 02:11:54.350
<v Speaker 2>making it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not think about it.</v>

2900
02:11:54.351 --> 02:11:54.680
<v Speaker 2>So much</v>

2901
02:11:54.960 --> 02:11:56.790
<v Speaker 3>one of the reasons why a friend of mine </v>
<v Speaker 3>got off of them,</v>

2902
02:11:56.791 --> 02:11:58.060
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2903
02:11:58.080 --> 02:12:03.080
<v Speaker 3>he realized like you're going to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>adapted to whatever dose they give you </v>

2904
02:12:03.080 --> 02:12:03.080
<v Speaker 3>and then they're going to come up with </v>
<v Speaker 3>some.</v>

2905
02:12:03.360 --> 02:12:08.360
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this isn't working anymore because your </v>

2906
02:12:08.360 --> 02:12:08.360
<v Speaker 3>body's accustomed to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You built up a tolerance.</v>

2907
02:12:08.360 --> 02:12:10.180
<v Speaker 3>So we're gonna try a new SSRI on you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2908
02:12:10.181 --> 02:12:10.240
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2909
02:12:10.930 --> 02:12:13.570
<v Speaker 2>I eventually got off the Cymbalta </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it was just,</v>

2910
02:12:13.600 --> 02:12:17.200
<v Speaker 2>I was getting to basically the </v>
<v Speaker 2>depressive dosage.</v>

2911
02:12:17.201 --> 02:12:20.110
<v Speaker 2>I was getting up to 60 milligrams or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something and so I was like,</v>

2912
02:12:20.111 --> 02:12:21.670
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to keep going with this.</v>

2913
02:12:21.730 --> 02:12:25.750
<v Speaker 2>And quite frankly it's not doing much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I got off that and they put me on one</v>

2914
02:12:25.751 --> 02:12:28.240
<v Speaker 2>court Lyrica,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which has an epileptic drug.</v>

2915
02:12:28.330 --> 02:12:29.350
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2916
02:12:29.590 --> 02:12:33.310
<v Speaker 2>I've tried a lot of drugs and air that </v>
<v Speaker 2>just mess with me,</v>

2917
02:12:33.340 --> 02:12:38.340
<v Speaker 2>mess with my head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to quit it because I was going to </v>

2918
02:12:38.340 --> 02:12:38.340
<v Speaker 2>lose my job because I just didn't turn </v>
<v Speaker 2>up to work anymore.</v>

2919
02:12:38.340 --> 02:12:42.751
<v Speaker 2>I would sleep through my alarms and wake</v>
<v Speaker 2>up four or five hours later and dislike </v>

2920
02:12:42.751 --> 02:12:44.890
<v Speaker 2>it just missed with me and I was captain</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the ship at the time.</v>

2921
02:12:44.891 --> 02:12:46.630
<v Speaker 2>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't be driving this ship.</v>

2922
02:12:46.631 --> 02:12:51.631
<v Speaker 2>I can't be in charge of all these people</v>
<v Speaker 2>and being messed up on some epileptic </v>

2923
02:12:51.791 --> 02:12:52.000
<v Speaker 2>drugs.</v>

2924
02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:57.000
<v Speaker 2>So I stopped doing that one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then what I try after that,</v>

2925
02:12:58.070 --> 02:12:58.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in depth,</v>

2926
02:12:59.230 --> 02:13:00.890
<v Speaker 2>which is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

2927
02:13:01.680 --> 02:13:04.840
<v Speaker 2>any depressant from the sixties I </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe it's not used at all anymore,</v>

2928
02:13:05.290 --> 02:13:07.450
<v Speaker 2>but there's no evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's like,</v>

2929
02:13:07.510 --> 02:13:12.510
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have like 10 drugs here that sends </v>

2930
02:13:12.510 --> 02:13:14.421
<v Speaker 2>some experiments experimenting on you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I've been on that one for a </v>

2931
02:13:14.421 --> 02:13:14.421
<v Speaker 2>while.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The same thing I just kept getting,</v>

2932
02:13:14.490 --> 02:13:17.060
<v Speaker 2>well the first time I took it I actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>slept for about 20 hours straight.</v>

2933
02:13:17.090 --> 02:13:22.090
<v Speaker 2>It just messed me up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I've been kind of very low doses of </v>

2934
02:13:22.090 --> 02:13:25.720
<v Speaker 2>it and once again it just stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not really doing much for the pain.</v>

2935
02:13:25.990 --> 02:13:30.990
<v Speaker 2>And then I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've just spent three weeks in the </v>

2936
02:13:30.990 --> 02:13:30.990
<v Speaker 2>Antarctic with no bags,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means no medication either.</v>

2937
02:13:30.990 --> 02:13:32.280
<v Speaker 2>So actually spent three weeks without </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2938
02:13:32.281 --> 02:13:35.490
<v Speaker 2>And I noticed straight away I had more </v>
<v Speaker 2>energy during the day.</v>

2939
02:13:35.500 --> 02:13:37.950
<v Speaker 2>It actually caused me to be fatigued for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the morning,</v>

2940
02:13:38.170 --> 02:13:39.740
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't have that anymore.</v>

2941
02:13:39.750 --> 02:13:44.130
<v Speaker 2>And the level of pain tolerance that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was giving me was just insignificant.</v>

2942
02:13:44.670 --> 02:13:49.670
<v Speaker 2>So now I'm just back to popping a pill </v>
<v Speaker 2>when it gets too much at night.</v>

2943
02:13:51.050 --> 02:13:52.200
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the moment,</v>

2944
02:13:52.201 --> 02:13:55.010
<v Speaker 2>coating pan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we call it Panadeine Forte,</v>

2945
02:13:55.030 --> 02:13:59.700
<v Speaker 2>which is a paracetamal and a small dose </v>
<v Speaker 2>according to just try to get some sleep.</v>

2946
02:14:00.030 --> 02:14:01.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just to the insomnia.</v>

2947
02:14:01.331 --> 02:14:04.530
<v Speaker 2>You get insomnia from all the pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's what I try and do.</v>

2948
02:14:04.590 --> 02:14:06.240
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2949
02:14:06.600 --> 02:14:11.600
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the next one they wanted me to try with </v>

2950
02:14:11.600 --> 02:14:11.600
<v Speaker 2>methadone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that one yet.</v>

2951
02:14:11.940 --> 02:14:13.980
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what they do to get people off of</v>

2952
02:14:13.981 --> 02:14:16.590
<v Speaker 2>heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just a Guinea pig.</v>

2953
02:14:16.620 --> 02:14:18.420
<v Speaker 2>They just keep experimenting with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck man.</v>

2954
02:14:18.480 --> 02:14:20.040
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that seems so crazy.</v>

2955
02:14:20.070 --> 02:14:21.720
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hopefully people will listen to this,</v>

2956
02:14:21.721 --> 02:14:23.590
<v Speaker 2>that have some information though.</v>

2957
02:14:23.960 --> 02:14:27.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm open to ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope they do reach out to you.</v>

2958
02:14:27.930 --> 02:14:32.930
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had pirates in here as a subject to </v>

2959
02:14:32.930 --> 02:14:32.930
<v Speaker 2>bring up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you have any experience with pirate?</v>

2960

<v Speaker 2>I'm know Tom Hanks movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2961
02:14:35.460 --> 02:14:37.520

<v Speaker 2>I just used to do a talk on it.</v>

2962
02:14:37.780 --> 02:14:39.420
<v Speaker 2>We did a through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2963
02:14:39.450 --> 02:14:42.300
<v Speaker 2>sort of not past Somalia but Tanzania,</v>

2964
02:14:42.600 --> 02:14:47.600
<v Speaker 2>Seychelles around that whole area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of people want to talk about </v>

2965
02:14:47.600 --> 02:14:50.511
<v Speaker 2>policy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I have a little presentation that I </v>

2966
02:14:50.511 --> 02:14:52.800
<v Speaker 2>kind of did on piracy in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what I quite liked to show people is</v>

2967
02:14:52.801 --> 02:14:55.870
<v Speaker 2>actually I liked bringing new technology</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the equation.</v>

2968
02:14:55.871 --> 02:14:58.650
<v Speaker 2>So there's a website called live piracy </v>
<v Speaker 2>map,</v>

2969
02:14:58.651 --> 02:15:03.651
<v Speaker 2>and you can actually see a map of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the world and all the current pirate </v>

2970
02:15:04.171 --> 02:15:06.480
<v Speaker 2>attacks around the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty cool.</v>

2971
02:15:06.660 --> 02:15:11.660
<v Speaker 2>Was that something to be concerned with </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're driving around that big </v>

2972
02:15:11.660 --> 02:15:11.660
<v Speaker 2>hundred million dollar beautiful boat?</v>

2973
02:15:11.660 --> 02:15:12.780
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not at all.</v>

2974
02:15:12.840 --> 02:15:14.640
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you guys have security with you?</v>

2975
02:15:14.790 --> 02:15:15.630
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not at all.</v>

2976
02:15:16.470 --> 02:15:18.630
<v Speaker 2>We fucked up saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She'd say,</v>

2977
02:15:18.631 --> 02:15:20.700
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>armed to the teeth superhero.</v>

2978
02:15:20.730 --> 02:15:23.760
<v Speaker 2>If I told you I'd have to kill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

2979
02:15:25.110 --> 02:15:28.170
<v Speaker 2>Pirates attack a cargo ship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something with very little crew,</v>

2980
02:15:28.200 --> 02:15:29.190
<v Speaker 2>10 cruise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

2981
02:15:29.191 --> 02:15:32.190
<v Speaker 2>They attack something that's a big prize</v>
<v Speaker 2>with very little people protecting it.</v>

2982
02:15:32.820 --> 02:15:37.820
<v Speaker 2>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Occasionally they'll go for yachts a </v>

2983
02:15:37.820 --> 02:15:40.110
<v Speaker 2>little time and yachts that cruise </v>
<v Speaker 2>ships,</v>

2984
02:15:40.111 --> 02:15:45.111
<v Speaker 2>I think the last sort of cruise ship or </v>
<v Speaker 2>big ship that they tried to attack as </v>

2985
02:15:45.111 --> 02:15:49.071
<v Speaker 2>they came up alongside it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all guests on board grabbed all the </v>

2986
02:15:49.071 --> 02:15:52.701
<v Speaker 2>outdoor furniture or the sun lounges and</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that and threw it at the </v>

2987
02:15:52.701 --> 02:15:53.130
<v Speaker 2>people coming up in the little boats and</v>
<v Speaker 2>killed some of them.</v>

2988
02:15:53.420 --> 02:15:54.600
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with furniture.</v>

2989
02:15:54.990 --> 02:15:59.990
<v Speaker 2>The furniture there with the pirates </v>
<v Speaker 2>were killed by falling furniture from </v>

2990
02:15:59.990 --> 02:15:59.990
<v Speaker 2>the roof.</v>

2991
02:15:59.990 --> 02:16:01.290
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they just don't do it.</v>

2992
02:16:01.300 --> 02:16:06.300
<v Speaker 2>There's how you jump on board a ship </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a that I'm on and you have 100 </v>

2993
02:16:06.300 --> 02:16:08.220
<v Speaker 2>guests and you have 80 credits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>180 people.</v>

2994
02:16:08.221 --> 02:16:09.980
<v Speaker 2>You're going to try and manage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2995
02:16:10.050 --> 02:16:11.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of get away with it.</v>

2996
02:16:11.400 --> 02:16:13.490
<v Speaker 2>Like there's the pirate map or the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2997
02:16:13.630 --> 02:16:16.170
<v Speaker 2>So that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the piracy map.</v>

2998
02:16:16.171 --> 02:16:17.610
<v Speaker 2>So you can click on each one of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>little,</v>

2999
02:16:17.611 --> 02:16:22.611
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>little tags and it will tell you a </v>

3000
02:16:22.611 --> 02:16:25.500
<v Speaker 2>little story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is all done by the insurance </v>

3001
02:16:25.500 --> 02:16:27.171
<v Speaker 2>agencies obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's just fascinating to see what's </v>

3002
02:16:27.171 --> 02:16:31.041
<v Speaker 2>going on and what I was trying to always</v>
<v Speaker 2>show to people is that people always go </v>

3003
02:16:31.041 --> 02:16:34.351
<v Speaker 2>Somali pirates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There isn't actually much piracy there </v>

3004
02:16:34.351 --> 02:16:34.351
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very,</v>

3005
02:16:34.351 --> 02:16:38.131
<v Speaker 2>very little.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of it's actually the Straits of </v>

3006
02:16:38.131 --> 02:16:40.591
<v Speaker 2>Malacca Singapore around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're real and most of the piracy is </v>

3007
02:16:40.591 --> 02:16:41.800
<v Speaker 2>we're the largest shipping channels are </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically.</v>

3008
02:16:42.020 --> 02:16:43.640
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Somalian story we've talked about on</v>

3009
02:16:43.641 --> 02:16:48.641
<v Speaker 3>the podcast many times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unfortunately I don't want to reiterate </v>

3010
02:16:48.641 --> 02:16:51.731
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but those people were forced into it </v>

3011
02:16:51.731 --> 02:16:55.570
<v Speaker 3>because of people dumping toxic waste </v>
<v Speaker 3>are fishermen were dumping toxic waste </v>

3012
02:16:55.570 --> 02:17:00.401
<v Speaker 3>off their shores and they kidnap them to</v>
<v Speaker 3>try to stop this dumping and then they </v>

3013
02:17:00.561 --> 02:17:02.840
<v Speaker 3>got a massive ransom and realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa,</v>

3014
02:17:02.870 --> 02:17:03.800
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck fishing.</v>

3015
02:17:04.080 --> 02:17:05.520
<v Speaker 3>Just start kidnapping people.</v>

3016
02:17:05.920 --> 02:17:10.920
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one turns into a pirate or a </v>

3017
02:17:10.920 --> 02:17:10.920
<v Speaker 2>terrorist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a.</v>

3018
02:17:10.920 --> 02:17:14.090
<v Speaker 2>it's a function of where they've grown </v>
<v Speaker 2>up and the experiences they've had that </v>

3019
02:17:14.090 --> 02:17:14.090
<v Speaker 2>have pushed them to that limit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3020
02:17:14.090 --> 02:17:14.290
<v Speaker 2>you've pushed them</v>

3021
02:17:14.460 --> 02:17:17.130
<v Speaker 3>to the edge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's always a reason for it.</v>

3022
02:17:17.280 --> 02:17:22.280
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the battle for resources and the </v>

3023
02:17:22.280 --> 02:17:24.231
<v Speaker 3>inequality of the resources and what you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can get in the world,</v>

3024
02:17:24.271 --> 02:17:27.180
<v Speaker 3>it just leads people to desperation and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what,</v>

3025
02:17:27.260 --> 02:17:29.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>going back to the alien thing,</v>

3026
02:17:29.280 --> 02:17:33.630
<v Speaker 3>that's what we would hope one day we </v>
<v Speaker 3>would get past when you get past this.</v>

3027
02:17:33.840 --> 02:17:38.840
<v Speaker 3>I mean we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd understand that like if we just </v>

3028
02:17:38.840 --> 02:17:38.840
<v Speaker 3>looked at the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if somehow or another we realized</v>

3029
02:17:38.840 --> 02:17:42.120
<v Speaker 3>that there's some sort of is a way to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>completely altruistic,</v>

3030
02:17:42.121 --> 02:17:47.121
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a way to be completely even and </v>

3031
02:17:47.121 --> 02:17:47.280
<v Speaker 3>fair and we would look at the globe and </v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

3032
02:17:47.281 --> 02:17:48.870
<v Speaker 3>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's plenty of resources.</v>

3033
02:17:48.871 --> 02:17:53.871
<v Speaker 3>We have boats and ships and let's just </v>
<v Speaker 3>evenly distributed all this stuff and </v>

3034
02:17:53.871 --> 02:17:55.260
<v Speaker 3>figure out a way we could all live in </v>
<v Speaker 3>harmony and everybody contribute,</v>

3035
02:17:55.800 --> 02:17:56.070
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

3036
02:17:57.590 --> 02:18:02.590
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's difficult with the way things are </v>

3037
02:18:02.590 --> 02:18:05.331
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very difficult to move into that </v>

3038
02:18:05.331 --> 02:18:05.331
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'd have to have some sort of a massive</v>

3039
02:18:05.331 --> 02:18:09.680
<v Speaker 2>transcendence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to go more into the whole </v>

3040
02:18:09.680 --> 02:18:09.680
<v Speaker 2>climate change thing normally before I </v>
<v Speaker 2>bring this up,</v>

3041
02:18:09.680 --> 02:18:12.350
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time I started off very </v>
<v Speaker 2>optimistic.</v>

3042
02:18:12.390 --> 02:18:14.520
<v Speaker 2>I started doing climate change talks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2007.</v>

3043
02:18:14.550 --> 02:18:16.620
<v Speaker 2>I was very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very optimistic that we can do this,</v>

3044
02:18:16.621 --> 02:18:18.180
<v Speaker 2>we can do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can do this now.</v>

3045
02:18:18.181 --> 02:18:21.910
<v Speaker 2>Fast forward almost 10 years later and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm apocalyptic mystic.</v>

3046
02:18:22.780 --> 02:18:24.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's I,</v>

3047
02:18:24.140 --> 02:18:26.820
<v Speaker 2>I think really if we want to change </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on now,</v>

3048
02:18:28.230 --> 02:18:31.470
<v Speaker 2>like any problem with when adults come </v>
<v Speaker 2>to you with a problem,</v>

3049
02:18:31.500 --> 02:18:36.500
<v Speaker 2>have you tried turning it on and off?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really think we kind of.</v>

3050
02:18:36.540 --> 02:18:39.480
<v Speaker 2>We get to the point now where we really </v>
<v Speaker 2>got to turn it all off and then start it</v>

3051
02:18:39.481 --> 02:18:43.290
<v Speaker 2>back up again in a carbon neutral kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of way.</v>

3052
02:18:43.560 --> 02:18:46.560
<v Speaker 2>That's what we're getting to right now </v>
<v Speaker 2>because what we're seeing now,</v>

3053
02:18:46.860 --> 02:18:48.450
<v Speaker 2>this is something that eludes most </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

3054
02:18:49.410 --> 02:18:54.410
<v Speaker 2>The effects we're seeing now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is two degrees Celsius above </v>

3055
02:18:54.410 --> 02:18:58.060
<v Speaker 2>degrees Celsius about industrial reits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The attic at the moment is 12 to 16 </v>

3056
02:18:58.060 --> 02:19:01.110
<v Speaker 2>degrees Celsius above the average </v>
<v Speaker 2>preindustrial time.</v>

3057
02:19:01.920 --> 02:19:03.840
<v Speaker 2>All this sort of stuff going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

3058
02:19:03.990 --> 02:19:08.990
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a 40 year lag between what we </v>

3059
02:19:08.990 --> 02:19:10.740
<v Speaker 2>pump out in pollution and CEO to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to what the actual temperature rises.</v>

3060
02:19:10.890 --> 02:19:14.550
<v Speaker 2>So what we're seeing now is from the mid</v>
<v Speaker 2>seventies,</v>

3061
02:19:15.510 --> 02:19:16.950
<v Speaker 2>we haven't even got up to the eighties </v>
<v Speaker 2>yet.</v>

3062
02:19:17.220 --> 02:19:18.780
<v Speaker 2>That's bananas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3063
02:19:18.960 --> 02:19:20.660
<v Speaker 2>You imagine what the next 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The eighties.</v>

3064
02:19:20.690 --> 02:19:22.740
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the what we did to the world during</v>

3065
02:19:22.741 --> 02:19:23.160
<v Speaker 2>the eighties.</v>

3066
02:19:23.220 --> 02:19:25.530
<v Speaker 3>When you're in Antarctica,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you look for places to move?</v>

3067
02:19:25.650 --> 02:19:26.220
<v Speaker 3>Just say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>

3068
02:19:26.580 --> 02:19:28.610
<v Speaker 3>built a house here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thirty years.</v>

3069
02:19:28.611 --> 02:19:30.290
<v Speaker 3>It'd be the shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>

3070
02:19:30.350 --> 02:19:31.730
<v Speaker 3>It's not too far off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3071
02:19:31.910 --> 02:19:34.220
<v Speaker 3>it's actually really quite well in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Antarctic peninsula.</v>

3072
02:19:34.250 --> 02:19:37.250
<v Speaker 3>It's a bit of a hot spot as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's warm.</v>

3073
02:19:37.251 --> 02:19:42.251
<v Speaker 3>I've got a picture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got a picture there of me in t </v>

3074
02:19:42.251 --> 02:19:46.541
<v Speaker 3>shirts and shorts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're talking this 30 degrees </v>

3075
02:19:46.541 --> 02:19:47.200
<v Speaker 3>Celsius warmer there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what does that in America?</v>

3076
02:19:47.670 --> 02:19:49.780
<v Speaker 3>In America Fair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fair enough.</v>

3077
02:19:49.900 --> 02:19:52.310
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we've talked about the Arctic.</v>

3078
02:19:52.311 --> 02:19:56.840
<v Speaker 3>The Arctic at the moment is in some </v>
<v Speaker 3>areas about 12 degrees Celsius above the</v>

3079
02:19:56.841 --> 02:20:00.520
<v Speaker 3>preindustrial levels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So God,</v>

3080
02:20:00.880 --> 02:20:04.160
<v Speaker 3>I never go to Fahrenheit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I would say yeah,</v>

3081
02:20:04.250 --> 02:20:05.740
<v Speaker 3>24,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost 30,</v>

3082
02:20:06.080 --> 02:20:11.080
<v Speaker 3>33 is very annoying that we have </v>
<v Speaker 3>different ways of telling the </v>

3083
02:20:11.080 --> 02:20:13.961
<v Speaker 3>temperature that is so goofy and </v>
<v Speaker 3>kilograms to like when we go to England </v>

3084
02:20:14.940 --> 02:20:15.980
<v Speaker 3>is the most ridiculous.</v>

3085
02:20:15.980 --> 02:20:20.480
<v Speaker 3>They have stone when we do weigh ins for</v>
<v Speaker 3>the UFC in England with 13 stone,</v>

3086
02:20:20.510 --> 02:20:24.710
<v Speaker 3>like what are you even talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why you've met stones,</v>

3087
02:20:24.711 --> 02:20:29.711
<v Speaker 3>like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thirteen pounds or something crazy like </v>

3088
02:20:29.711 --> 02:20:30.260
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some random ancient fucking king shit.</v>

3089
02:20:30.320 --> 02:20:35.320
<v Speaker 3>Somebody had a rock and they wanted </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody to be measured by that route </v>

3090
02:20:35.320 --> 02:20:35.540
<v Speaker 3>to put this out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Metric system is a wonderful thing.</v>

3091
02:20:35.660 --> 02:20:40.660
<v Speaker 3>So way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We should have adopted it should we </v>

3092
02:20:40.660 --> 02:20:43.751
<v Speaker 3>tried.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I was in high school before high </v>

3093
02:20:43.751 --> 02:20:43.751
<v Speaker 3>school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe,</v>

3094
02:20:43.751 --> 02:20:43.751
<v Speaker 3>I believe junior high school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were.</v>

3095
02:20:43.751 --> 02:20:48.350
<v Speaker 3>There was an attempt to indoctrinate the</v>
<v Speaker 3>American people on soccer and the metric</v>

3096
02:20:48.351 --> 02:20:50.870
<v Speaker 3>system wholesale.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're like,</v>

3097
02:20:50.900 --> 02:20:54.200
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we dug our heels in.</v>

3098
02:20:54.610 --> 02:20:58.070
<v Speaker 3>No soccer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I cannot understand but a metric system.</v>

3099
02:20:58.490 --> 02:21:01.700
<v Speaker 3>I just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder like when you're in school,</v>

3100
02:21:01.701 --> 02:21:06.380
<v Speaker 3>like trying to learn maths and science,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not using the metric system.</v>

3101
02:21:06.440 --> 02:21:08.030
<v Speaker 3>That must be hard work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3102
02:21:08.120 --> 02:21:12.380
<v Speaker 3>You remember all that sort of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of silly because you can do,</v>

3103
02:21:12.620 --> 02:21:16.070
<v Speaker 3>you can see the metric system is better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a better system.</v>

3104
02:21:16.071 --> 02:21:21.071
<v Speaker 3>It's a system of 10.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know when you get into inches and </v>

3105
02:21:21.071 --> 02:21:23.030
<v Speaker 3>yards and systems of 12,</v>
<v Speaker 3>12 inches and like,</v>

3106
02:21:23.200 --> 02:21:25.520
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many yards is a.</v>

3107
02:21:25.521 --> 02:21:28.160
<v Speaker 3>What was a meter to a yard is how much </v>
<v Speaker 3>difference.</v>

3108
02:21:28.161 --> 02:21:30.650
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ninety meters is almost the same,</v>

3109
02:21:30.651 --> 02:21:35.651
<v Speaker 3>but there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's variables and then the kilos </v>

3110
02:21:35.651 --> 02:21:39.611
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the kilograms and measuring that and </v>

3111
02:21:39.611 --> 02:21:39.611
<v Speaker 3>Fahrenheit and Celsius.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

3112
02:21:39.611 --> 02:21:41.210
<v Speaker 3>it's dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like one system would be great.</v>

3113
02:21:41.660 --> 02:21:46.660
<v Speaker 3>They could have done it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They could have stuck with it in the </v>

3114
02:21:46.660 --> 02:21:46.660
<v Speaker 3>sixties and the seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We could have been all right.</v>

3115
02:21:46.660 --> 02:21:48.310
<v Speaker 3>Right now man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't the rest of the world.</v>

3116
02:21:48.550 --> 02:21:50.570
<v Speaker 3>We're wherever with metric system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come join us.</v>

3117
02:21:50.571 --> 02:21:53.780
<v Speaker 3>We're not England though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had the stones,</v>

3118
02:21:53.781 --> 02:21:55.850
<v Speaker 3>but they have miles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3119
02:21:56.030 --> 02:21:56.710
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3120
02:21:56.840 --> 02:21:58.210
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You sure?</v>

3121
02:21:58.211 --> 02:22:00.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think these kilometers.</v>

3122
02:22:00.520 --> 02:22:02.840
<v Speaker 3>See if England uses miles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think these miles,</v>

3123
02:22:03.140 --> 02:22:05.270
<v Speaker 3>I think they use inches,</v>
<v Speaker 3>feet miles.</v>

3124
02:22:05.840 --> 02:22:08.930
<v Speaker 3>Pretty sure if they use inches and feet </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was kilometers,</v>

3125
02:22:08.931 --> 02:22:10.880
<v Speaker 3>they're retarded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No wacky.</v>

3126
02:22:10.910 --> 02:22:14.060
<v Speaker 3>I fill it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was you guys and a USA in Bhutan were</v>

3127
02:22:14.061 --> 02:22:15.770
<v Speaker 3>the only people in the be looking like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

3128
02:22:16.220 --> 02:22:18.720
<v Speaker 3>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3129
02:22:18.800 --> 02:22:21.290
<v Speaker 3>they longed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does it say in the UK?</v>

3130
02:22:21.291 --> 02:22:26.030
<v Speaker 3>Miles are used almost exclusively on </v>
<v Speaker 3>road signs I just used in</v>

3131
02:22:26.030 --> 02:22:26.700
<v Speaker 1>road sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3132
02:22:27.090 --> 02:22:28.020
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

3133
02:22:28.040 --> 02:22:29.150
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking in there,</v>

3134
02:22:29.730 --> 02:22:34.730
<v Speaker 1>not just road science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they also use it on their </v>

3135
02:22:34.730 --> 02:22:34.730
<v Speaker 1>spirometers like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3136
02:22:34.730 --> 02:22:36.720
<v Speaker 1>35 miles an hour because you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever spent Amr?</v>

3137
02:22:36.750 --> 02:22:41.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to use it just on the </v>

3138
02:22:41.750 --> 02:22:43.101
<v Speaker 1>road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Signs of their fucking car doesn't say </v>

3139
02:22:43.101 --> 02:22:45.111
<v Speaker 1>what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it's in their automobiles to </v>

3140
02:22:45.111 --> 02:22:45.111
<v Speaker 1>tweed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Having a mixed like that isn't.</v>

3141
02:22:45.111 --> 02:22:46.480
<v Speaker 1>It is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't too aware of that.</v>

3142
02:22:46.920 --> 02:22:48.660
<v Speaker 1>Will England's not a mix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They use that.</v>

3143
02:22:48.670 --> 02:22:53.670
<v Speaker 1>We are their system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the reason why we use inches and </v>

3144
02:22:53.670 --> 02:22:57.381
<v Speaker 1>feet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feet and all that jazz was because of </v>

3145
02:22:57.381 --> 02:22:57.381
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Miles.</v>

3146
02:22:57.381 --> 02:22:57.381
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's England.</v>

3147
02:22:57.381 --> 02:22:58.680
<v Speaker 1>What we did too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course in Australia we got smart.</v>

3148
02:22:58.681 --> 02:23:01.200
<v Speaker 1>You guys wised up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another reason why Australia is awesome,</v>

3149
02:23:02.010 --> 02:23:02.710
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

3150
02:23:03.140 --> 02:23:04.380
<v Speaker 1>we have our moments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do.</v>

3151
02:23:04.430 --> 02:23:06.660
<v Speaker 1>We were the second nation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let women vote.</v>

3152
02:23:07.390 --> 02:23:12.390
<v Speaker 1>We got a lot of good things behind us </v>
<v Speaker 1>that being very progressive and kind of </v>

3153
02:23:12.390 --> 02:23:13.830
<v Speaker 1>ahead of the loop on a few things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but who's the first us,</v>

3154
02:23:13.980 --> 02:23:15.190
<v Speaker 1>New Zealand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Zealand.</v>

3155
02:23:15.210 --> 02:23:17.130
<v Speaker 1>The first people that people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women vote.</v>

3156
02:23:17.240 --> 02:23:19.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Goddamn beautiful.</v>

3157
02:23:19.380 --> 02:23:24.380
<v Speaker 1>It's a beautiful kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A buddy of mine was over there right </v>

3158
02:23:24.380 --> 02:23:24.380
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Send me some pictures.</v>

3159
02:23:24.380 --> 02:23:24.380
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3160
02:23:24.450 --> 02:23:26.250
<v Speaker 1>it's a pretty place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try and get there wherever I can.</v>

3161
02:23:26.400 --> 02:23:31.400
<v Speaker 1>What is your favorite place to visit or </v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have a favorite place you've </v>

3162
02:23:31.400 --> 02:23:31.400
<v Speaker 1>explored?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3163
02:23:31.400 --> 02:23:34.380
<v Speaker 1>you've literally been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because every,</v>

3164
02:23:34.381 --> 02:23:36.320
<v Speaker 1>every expedition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't give me a favor.</v>

3165
02:23:36.390 --> 02:23:41.390
<v Speaker 1>Tell me about something awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every expedition I do has something </v>

3166
02:23:41.390 --> 02:23:41.580
<v Speaker 1>amazing that we do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3167
02:23:41.581 --> 02:23:44.160
<v Speaker 1>And so every single one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's one place that I really,</v>

3168
02:23:44.161 --> 02:23:45.660
<v Speaker 1>really like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3169
02:23:45.661 --> 02:23:48.960
<v Speaker 1>so there's lots and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hot.</v>

3170
02:23:48.990 --> 02:23:51.510
<v Speaker 1>But if you were to specify specific </v>
<v Speaker 1>expedition,</v>

3171
02:23:51.511 --> 02:23:52.620
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you the highlights of it.</v>

3172
02:23:52.620 --> 02:23:57.620
<v Speaker 1>So probably one of my favorite place in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world at the moment is south </v>

3173
02:23:57.620 --> 02:23:57.620
<v Speaker 1>Georgia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a,</v>

3174
02:23:57.620 --> 02:23:58.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Falkland Islands,</v>

3175
02:23:58.760 --> 02:24:01.140
<v Speaker 1>it's just over a little bit further into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3176
02:24:01.260 --> 02:24:06.260
<v Speaker 1>into the ocean there east.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you've got this little tiny rock </v>

3177
02:24:06.260 --> 02:24:08.370
<v Speaker 1>in the middle of a big ocean and all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals have to go somewhere.</v>

3178
02:24:08.371 --> 02:24:11.130
<v Speaker 1>So they all go to this little tiny rock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you go on this beach,</v>

3179
02:24:11.250 --> 02:24:12.260
<v Speaker 1>St Andrews,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>

3180
02:24:12.270 --> 02:24:15.300
<v Speaker 1>you've got 400,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>king penguins,</v>

3181
02:24:15.320 --> 02:24:20.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on this one little beach is just thick </v>

3182
02:24:20.320 --> 02:24:21.720
<v Speaker 1>with animals and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it had a lot of ceiling.</v>

3183
02:24:21.721 --> 02:24:26.721
<v Speaker 1>But now the first year of coming back </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you literally get to these </v>

3184
02:24:26.721 --> 02:24:29.571
<v Speaker 1>beaches and you kind of got to try and </v>
<v Speaker 1>make your way through the penguins and </v>

3185
02:24:29.571 --> 02:24:30.150
<v Speaker 1>the seals to actually get ashore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that crazy.</v>

3186
02:24:30.210 --> 02:24:35.210
<v Speaker 1>And one of my favorite things to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>there is I just laid down on the beach </v>

3187
02:24:35.210 --> 02:24:37.020
<v Speaker 1>and all the little tiny baby first seal </v>
<v Speaker 1>pups,</v>

3188
02:24:37.300 --> 02:24:39.060
<v Speaker 1>little tiny things with bobbly heads.</v>

3189
02:24:39.420 --> 02:24:41.160
<v Speaker 1>They all come up and they pile on top of</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

3190
02:24:41.161 --> 02:24:44.790
<v Speaker 1>And it's just amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing experience to be in.</v>

3191
02:24:44.791 --> 02:24:49.290
<v Speaker 1>Amongst so many animals that are just as</v>
<v Speaker 1>inquisitive about you as they are.</v>

3192
02:24:51.240 --> 02:24:52.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some crazy,</v>

3193
02:24:52.141 --> 02:24:53.730
<v Speaker 1>crazy shots there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3194
02:24:53.731 --> 02:24:55.930
<v Speaker 1>That's so beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

3195
02:24:56.200 --> 02:24:57.510
<v Speaker 1>it's a stunning spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got,</v>

3196
02:24:57.560 --> 02:25:00.090
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got some images somewhere as well.</v>

3197
02:25:00.200 --> 02:25:05.200
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the perspective that you gain from </v>

3198
02:25:05.200 --> 02:25:05.810
<v Speaker 1>visiting all these amazing places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3199
02:25:06.480 --> 02:25:09.960
<v Speaker 1>and then when you come and you talk to </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that sort of live in one city and</v>

3200
02:25:09.961 --> 02:25:12.840
<v Speaker 1>never leave that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel bad for those people.</v>

3201
02:25:14.880 --> 02:25:16.620
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's got their own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their own path.</v>

3202
02:25:16.690 --> 02:25:17.930
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's thinking.</v>

3203
02:25:17.970 --> 02:25:20.700
<v Speaker 1>You all zen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

3204
02:25:20.910 --> 02:25:21.690
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

3205
02:25:21.870 --> 02:25:25.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean I guess a little bit of pity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe a little bit of like,</v>

3206
02:25:25.020 --> 02:25:30.020
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have a passport that sound </v>

3207
02:25:30.020 --> 02:25:30.020
<v Speaker 1>fortunate to live in this wildlife </v>
<v Speaker 1>adventure.</v>

3208
02:25:30.020 --> 02:25:34.961
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an insane path and I think there's </v>

3209
02:25:34.961 --> 02:25:36.660
<v Speaker 1>something cool about talking to people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that travel all over the world.</v>

3210
02:25:36.661 --> 02:25:39.310
<v Speaker 1>It's like they have a perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like they're like,</v>

3211
02:25:39.790 --> 02:25:40.860
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

3212
02:25:40.930 --> 02:25:42.520
<v Speaker 1>Like you go to a bunch of different </v>
<v Speaker 1>places,</v>

3213
02:25:42.521 --> 02:25:44.950
<v Speaker 1>you see a bunch of different ways that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people live and you go,</v>

3214
02:25:45.070 --> 02:25:46.060
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

3215
02:25:46.390 --> 02:25:49.960
<v Speaker 1>there's not really one way to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no better way or bad way.</v>

3216
02:25:49.961 --> 02:25:52.480
<v Speaker 1>There's just different ways to do so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

3217
02:25:52.850 --> 02:25:54.730
<v Speaker 1>that's what you see everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3218
02:25:55.080 --> 02:25:55.480
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3219
02:25:55.481 --> 02:26:00.481
<v Speaker 1>I've got some friends who left high </v>
<v Speaker 1>school and they married the local </v>

3220
02:26:00.481 --> 02:26:03.811
<v Speaker 1>mechanic and don't even have a passport </v>
<v Speaker 1>to dude who's married and mechanic what </v>

3221
02:26:03.811 --> 02:26:04.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about.</v>

3222
02:26:04.230 --> 02:26:05.540
<v Speaker 1>Female girls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but whatever.</v>

3223
02:26:06.220 --> 02:26:11.220
<v Speaker 1>Same difference,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but basically never left the town that </v>

3224
02:26:11.220 --> 02:26:11.220
<v Speaker 1>they grew up in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3225
02:26:11.220 --> 02:26:11.380
<v Speaker 1>and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what they do.</v>

3226
02:26:11.440 --> 02:26:14.110
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that town as mushrooms and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>trip in a different way.</v>

3227
02:26:14.860 --> 02:26:16.810
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of cow Patty Duke who do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

3228
02:26:16.930 --> 02:26:17.830
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

3229
02:26:17.860 --> 02:26:18.610
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

3230
02:26:18.611 --> 02:26:19.240
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

3231
02:26:19.450 --> 02:26:24.450
<v Speaker 1>But I think about that when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I think of traveling to different </v>

3232
02:26:24.450 --> 02:26:27.451
<v Speaker 1>cultures and experiencing these really </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly varied ways of living that </v>

3233
02:26:28.931 --> 02:26:33.931
<v Speaker 1>people have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always think new look at all the </v>

3234
02:26:33.931 --> 02:26:33.931
<v Speaker 1>different varieties of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of life.</v>

3235
02:26:33.931 --> 02:26:38.260
<v Speaker 1>Like I posted this instagram video last </v>
<v Speaker 1>night of this jellyfish that I saw in an</v>

3236
02:26:38.261 --> 02:26:41.820
<v Speaker 1>aquarium and I remember thinking when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was looking at that jellyfish,</v>

3237
02:26:41.830 --> 02:26:44.410
<v Speaker 1>like what if that thing was on another </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet?</v>

3238
02:26:44.411 --> 02:26:48.010
<v Speaker 1>We would think it would be the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating discovery that man is.</v>

3239
02:26:48.730 --> 02:26:51.490
<v Speaker 1>Don't even get me started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's jellyfish that are immortal,</v>

3240
02:26:52.390 --> 02:26:57.390
<v Speaker 1>immortal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like literally they live for live </v>

3241
02:26:57.390 --> 02:26:57.390
<v Speaker 1>forever.</v>

3242
02:26:57.390 --> 02:26:57.390
<v Speaker 1>Look at that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

3243
02:26:57.390 --> 02:27:01.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a great little video </v>

3244
02:27:01.950 --> 02:27:01.950
<v Speaker 1>cephalopods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if you're talking about aliens,</v>

3245
02:27:01.950 --> 02:27:06.660
<v Speaker 1>underwater cephalopods is where it's at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And cephalopods the Nautilus Nautilus,</v>

3246
02:27:06.671 --> 02:27:11.671
<v Speaker 1>Shell Octopus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>squid and cuttlefish and cuddle fish on </v>

3247
02:27:11.671 --> 02:27:14.830
<v Speaker 1>my favorite creature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>

3248
02:27:14.831 --> 02:27:19.831
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a video on my youtube channel </v>

3249
02:27:19.831 --> 02:27:19.831
<v Speaker 1>called Adam verse cuttle fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll,</v>

3250
02:27:19.831 --> 02:27:20.080
<v Speaker 1>you'll dig it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3251
02:27:20.110 --> 02:27:21.490
<v Speaker 1>me just free diamond with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cuttlefish,</v>

3252
02:27:21.520 --> 02:27:23.050
<v Speaker 1>but they're the most amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing,</v>

3253
02:27:23.051 --> 02:27:26.290
<v Speaker 1>great trailer and the alien in so many </v>
<v Speaker 1>respects.</v>

3254
02:27:26.291 --> 02:27:28.560
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of the research on them is </v>
<v Speaker 1>only like five years older.</v>

3255
02:27:28.570 --> 02:27:33.570
<v Speaker 1>So we're still working stuff out because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're the fastest color and texture </v>

3256
02:27:33.570 --> 02:27:34.750
<v Speaker 1>chamber in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They like a neon sign,</v>

3257
02:27:34.751 --> 02:27:39.751
<v Speaker 1>pulsating color shoe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's about 390 DPI is the </v>

3258
02:27:39.751 --> 02:27:40.190
<v Speaker 1>resolution they can predict on this </v>
<v Speaker 1>scheme.</v>

3259
02:27:40.660 --> 02:27:43.450
<v Speaker 1>It's just phenomenal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have three hearts.</v>

3260
02:27:44.440 --> 02:27:46.180
<v Speaker 1>They don't have hemoglobin that I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>read blood.</v>

3261
02:27:46.180 --> 02:27:48.010
<v Speaker 1>They've green blood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a copper based blood.</v>

3262
02:27:48.660 --> 02:27:51.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm a little bit less inefficient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hence they have three hearts.</v>

3263
02:27:51.990 --> 02:27:53.620
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have like a jet engine,</v>

3264
02:27:53.621 --> 02:27:58.621
<v Speaker 1>they pump water and around their head </v>
<v Speaker 1>and push it out a little nozzle at the </v>

3265
02:27:58.621 --> 02:27:58.621
<v Speaker 1>front.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3266
02:27:58.621 --> 02:28:02.810
<v Speaker 1>look at that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like an octopus with tiny legs in </v>

3267
02:28:02.810 --> 02:28:05.530
<v Speaker 1>the cephalopod family as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this one's got a cuttlefish bone,</v>

3268
02:28:05.531 --> 02:28:10.531
<v Speaker 1>so it's neutrally buoyant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of just floating off the </v>

3269
02:28:10.531 --> 02:28:10.531
<v Speaker 1>surface,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it looks like whatever's behind it.</v>

3270
02:28:10.531 --> 02:28:14.791
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very good at camouflage and also </v>

3271
02:28:14.791 --> 02:28:17.731
<v Speaker 1>communicates via color as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what we couldn't work out for many </v>

3272
02:28:17.731 --> 02:28:19.180
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you put them in a dark box and they</v>

3273
02:28:19.181 --> 02:28:24.181
<v Speaker 1>will still mimic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you put in a box with no light </v>

3274
02:28:24.181 --> 02:28:24.181
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They</v>

3275
02:28:24.181 --> 02:28:27.070
<v Speaker 2>will still mimic whatever is behind them</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though there's no light there to </v>

3276
02:28:27.070 --> 02:28:27.610
<v Speaker 2>actually use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they would also mimic color and</v>

3277
02:28:27.611 --> 02:28:32.611
<v Speaker 2>get their eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean they will mimic what's </v>

3278
02:28:32.611 --> 02:28:32.611
<v Speaker 2>behind them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there are many youth,</v>

3279
02:28:32.611 --> 02:28:36.180
<v Speaker 2>a wall put a cuttlefish in a box pitch </v>
<v Speaker 2>black and you put a triangle,</v>

3280
02:28:36.261 --> 02:28:41.261
<v Speaker 2>a triangle shape behind them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They will mimic on the other side of </v>

3281
02:28:41.261 --> 02:28:42.590
<v Speaker 2>triangle shape in their skin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we still,</v>

3282
02:28:42.680 --> 02:28:45.230
<v Speaker 2>we're still trying to work out how they </v>
<v Speaker 2>do this because there's no light.</v>

3283
02:28:45.260 --> 02:28:48.920
<v Speaker 2>And we knew that they did it with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>color that their eyes don't see color.</v>

3284
02:28:48.921 --> 02:28:50.830
<v Speaker 2>I see black and white,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heavy amount of contrast.</v>

3285
02:28:50.860 --> 02:28:54.890
<v Speaker 2>We actually only two years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they worked out in their skin.</v>

3286
02:28:54.920 --> 02:28:57.230
<v Speaker 2>They see color via their skin or their </v>
<v Speaker 2>eyes.</v>

3287
02:28:58.640 --> 02:29:00.860
<v Speaker 2>I can go on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

3288
02:29:00.861 --> 02:29:03.020
<v Speaker 2>There's sexual reproduction is mom is </v>
<v Speaker 2>really cool.</v>

3289
02:29:03.560 --> 02:29:08.560
<v Speaker 2>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have a lack of our offices that </v>

3290
02:29:08.560 --> 02:29:08.560
<v Speaker 2>don't have too many artifices to use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we asked and are.</v>

3291
02:29:08.560 --> 02:29:13.490
<v Speaker 2>So what they do is the male cuttlefish </v>
<v Speaker 2>gets an arm and sticks it up his </v>

3292
02:29:13.490 --> 02:29:14.750
<v Speaker 2>nostril,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll call it a nostril.</v>

3293
02:29:14.780 --> 02:29:15.680
<v Speaker 2>It's an artifice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

3294
02:29:16.100 --> 02:29:21.100
<v Speaker 2>and pulls out a sack of sperm and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>goes up to the female and then sticks </v>

3295
02:29:21.100 --> 02:29:22.130
<v Speaker 2>that arm with the sacral sperm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lauren up her nostril,</v>

3296
02:29:22.160 --> 02:29:27.160
<v Speaker 2>left nostril.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's how they reproduce what?</v>

3297
02:29:28.780 --> 02:29:31.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sack fisting.</v>

3298
02:29:31.640 --> 02:29:34.720
<v Speaker 2>Take a sack of sperm and they fixed it </v>
<v Speaker 2>up</v>

3299
02:29:34.780 --> 02:29:38.840
<v Speaker 3>your nose and nostrils.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The same orifice they use for smelling.</v>

3300
02:29:39.260 --> 02:29:41.770
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we call it industrial,</v>

3301
02:29:41.771 --> 02:29:44.460
<v Speaker 2>but it's just a whole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a whole.</v>

3302
02:29:44.720 --> 02:29:47.710
<v Speaker 2>But it's the closest one to their sexual</v>
<v Speaker 2>watch it here.</v>

3303
02:29:47.800 --> 02:29:49.630
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not prepared for this.</v>

3304
02:29:49.631 --> 02:29:54.631
<v Speaker 2>January cuddles grabbing her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he died straight after that.</v>

3305
02:29:57.101 --> 02:29:58.650
<v Speaker 2>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3306
02:29:58.660 --> 02:30:01.620
<v Speaker 2>They only live for about 18 months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the Australian giant cuttle fish,</v>

3307
02:30:01.840 --> 02:30:02.950
<v Speaker 2>different cuttlefish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different things,</v>

3308
02:30:02.951 --> 02:30:04.810
<v Speaker 2>but 18 months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they do that.</v>

3309
02:30:04.811 --> 02:30:06.160
<v Speaker 2>They reproduced,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they die.</v>

3310
02:30:06.610 --> 02:30:11.610
<v Speaker 3>My Friend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remy Warren has this show called Apex </v>

3311
02:30:11.610 --> 02:30:11.610
<v Speaker 3>Predator where he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3312
02:30:11.610 --> 02:30:15.490
<v Speaker 3>he travels to all these different </v>
<v Speaker 3>environments and tries to figure out how</v>

3313
02:30:15.491 --> 02:30:18.760
<v Speaker 3>these various apex predators hunt their </v>
<v Speaker 3>food and how they do it.</v>

3314
02:30:18.761 --> 02:30:23.761
<v Speaker 3>And he said without a doubt that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>most fascinating one that he did he </v>

3315
02:30:24.460 --> 02:30:28.990
<v Speaker 3>studied was the octopus and it's like </v>
<v Speaker 3>they are some kind of an alien creature.</v>

3316
02:30:29.690 --> 02:30:32.350
<v Speaker 3>And when I didn't know until he came on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the show,</v>

3317
02:30:32.351 --> 02:30:37.351
<v Speaker 3>like how quickly they can change into </v>
<v Speaker 3>the background that was like completely </v>

3318
02:30:38.021 --> 02:30:41.020
<v Speaker 3>camouflaged,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just in color but also in texture.</v>

3319
02:30:41.021 --> 02:30:42.670
<v Speaker 3>They mimic the texture behind them.</v>

3320
02:30:43.270 --> 02:30:43.930
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3321
02:30:43.990 --> 02:30:45.700
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to find them when you're scuba</v>
<v Speaker 2>diving.</v>

3322
02:30:45.701 --> 02:30:48.770
<v Speaker 2>It's actually hard to find them because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they look exactly like what a them.</v>

3323
02:30:49.260 --> 02:30:50.860
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have so many,</v>

3324
02:30:50.890 --> 02:30:53.350
<v Speaker 2>like the more research you do on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just amazing.</v>

3325
02:30:53.351 --> 02:30:55.420
<v Speaker 2>They have the intelligence of a six year</v>
<v Speaker 2>old child.</v>

3326
02:30:55.710 --> 02:31:00.710
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so they've been actually class </v>

3327
02:31:00.710 --> 02:31:01.040
<v Speaker 2>recently as like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget the word,</v>

3328
02:31:01.041 --> 02:31:02.590
<v Speaker 2>like sentience beans or something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

3329
02:31:02.591 --> 02:31:07.591
<v Speaker 2>So they're in the same class as dogs and</v>
<v Speaker 2>monkeys and dolphins not do tests on </v>

3330
02:31:07.961 --> 02:31:09.760
<v Speaker 2>them that harmed them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically.</v>

3331
02:31:09.840 --> 02:31:11.860
<v Speaker 2>Biggest still going for Sushi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

3332
02:31:11.861 --> 02:31:13.000
<v Speaker 2>you can kill them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just can't.</v>

3333
02:31:14.500 --> 02:31:17.500
<v Speaker 2>You can still get grilled octopus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like grilled six year old.</v>

3334
02:31:17.950 --> 02:31:19.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean you probably,</v>

3335
02:31:20.300 --> 02:31:23.670
<v Speaker 1>it's a strange thing that we do and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>decide what we will eat,</v>

3336
02:31:24.510 --> 02:31:29.510
<v Speaker 1>what will we.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it varies hugely uncultured well </v>

3337
02:31:29.510 --> 02:31:33.090
<v Speaker 1>that we don't eat dog here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but mean I made a mistake of watching a </v>

3338
02:31:34.320 --> 02:31:39.320
<v Speaker 1>piece.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a vice piece on that </v>

3339
02:31:39.320 --> 02:31:40.170
<v Speaker 1>Yulin dog festival and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa man,</v>

3340
02:31:40.890 --> 02:31:42.810
<v Speaker 1>good Lord it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>

3341
02:31:42.840 --> 02:31:47.100
<v Speaker 1>it's entirely cultural because if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were an Indian person who is a Hindu and</v>

3342
02:31:47.101 --> 02:31:50.490
<v Speaker 1>you see what we do to cows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be equally,</v>

3343
02:31:50.491 --> 02:31:53.820
<v Speaker 1>if not more deserving because their cows</v>
<v Speaker 1>are wholly what I love.</v>

3344
02:31:53.910 --> 02:31:56.580
<v Speaker 1>I haven't done much India,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've done the poll is that,</v>

3345
02:31:56.581 --> 02:31:57.570
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't eat this cow,</v>

3346
02:31:57.571 --> 02:31:59.220
<v Speaker 1>this cow sacred,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this buffalo,</v>

3347
02:31:59.580 --> 02:32:04.030
<v Speaker 1>it's tasty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just like what the together with the</v>

3348
02:32:04.410 --> 02:32:06.420
<v Speaker 1>bird egg people and try to figure this </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

3349
02:32:06.720 --> 02:32:11.720
<v Speaker 1>It's just when you see certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>traditions that exist in these cultures </v>

3350
02:32:12.061 --> 02:32:15.150
<v Speaker 1>and try to decipher like how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how they got started,</v>

3351
02:32:15.870 --> 02:32:17.040
<v Speaker 1>there's always a reason for it.</v>

3352
02:32:17.070 --> 02:32:19.500
<v Speaker 1>You can't go back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can always just send a recent of why</v>

3353
02:32:19.501 --> 02:32:20.500
<v Speaker 1>this started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was,</v>

3354
02:32:20.501 --> 02:32:25.501
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't eat pork here will you get </v>

3355
02:32:25.501 --> 02:32:25.501
<v Speaker 1>Salmonella and it kills you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3356
02:32:25.501 --> 02:32:27.810
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Always a risk that's for kosher food and</v>

3357
02:32:27.811 --> 02:32:32.811
<v Speaker 1>things along those inspirational people </v>
<v Speaker 1>have this hugely complex system of who </v>

3358
02:32:32.811 --> 02:32:34.440
<v Speaker 1>you are allowed to talk to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who you're allowed to marry.</v>

3359
02:32:34.441 --> 02:32:39.441
<v Speaker 1>This things called skins and takes a </v>
<v Speaker 1>long time to come and get your head </v>

3360
02:32:39.441 --> 02:32:42.651
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you look at the science behind </v>

3361
02:32:42.651 --> 02:32:44.811
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the most efficient way ever </v>

3362
02:32:44.811 --> 02:32:47.871
<v Speaker 1>conceived by humanity to ancient </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultures to prevent inbreeding.</v>

3363
02:32:49.080 --> 02:32:51.260
<v Speaker 1>So you're not allowed to talk to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>sister.</v>

3364
02:32:51.840 --> 02:32:56.840
<v Speaker 1>Can't talk to her and Kinda talk to </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he might have sex with him so I </v>

3365
02:32:56.840 --> 02:32:56.840
<v Speaker 1>won't have sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My sister.</v>

3366
02:32:56.840 --> 02:32:57.840
<v Speaker 1>We would trust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's gross,</v>

3367
02:32:58.260 --> 02:33:01.240
<v Speaker 1>but they can't talk to their sister.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3368
02:33:01.260 --> 02:33:06.260
<v Speaker 1>And generally their mother as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that makes you want to fuck your </v>

3369
02:33:06.260 --> 02:33:06.260
<v Speaker 1>sister more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like damn.</v>

3370
02:33:06.260 --> 02:33:07.470
<v Speaker 1>It must be good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to keep me away from her.</v>

3371
02:33:08.560 --> 02:33:10.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a little twisted.</v>

3372
02:33:11.010 --> 02:33:12.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3373
02:33:15.520 --> 02:33:16.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3374
02:33:16.400 --> 02:33:18.690
<v Speaker 1>hypothetically this person that lived a </v>
<v Speaker 1>long,</v>

3375
02:33:18.691 --> 02:33:20.670
<v Speaker 1>long time ago when they came up these </v>
<v Speaker 1>weird rules.</v>

3376
02:33:21.220 --> 02:33:23.530
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it possible for a restroom?</v>

3377
02:33:24.420 --> 02:33:25.980
<v Speaker 1>Just be two seconds and then we're gonna</v>
<v Speaker 1>come back.</v>

3378
02:33:26.040 --> 02:33:27.510
<v Speaker 1>Maybe some climate change will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure,</v>

3379
02:33:27.511 --> 02:33:28.230
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

3380
02:33:28.231 --> 02:33:29.640
<v Speaker 1>Short reproduction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you like your watch,</v>

3383
02:33:33.900 --> 02:33:34.570
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look.</v>

3384
02:33:34.571 --> 02:33:35.850
<v Speaker 1>And it doesn't have to be expensive </v>
<v Speaker 1>copays.</v>

3385
02:33:36.010 --> 02:33:37.080
<v Speaker 1>You like to have a look?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3386
02:33:37.160 --> 02:33:38.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry about it.</v>

3387
02:33:38.520 --> 02:33:41.280
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll be back again.</v>

3388
02:33:41.640 --> 02:33:46.640
<v Speaker 1>I when the bladder war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to find someone who could sit </v>

3389
02:33:46.640 --> 02:33:48.240
<v Speaker 1>here and drink coffee and whiskey as </v>
<v Speaker 1>long as we can.</v>

3390
02:33:48.690 --> 02:33:49.610
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck's wrong?</v>

3391
02:33:49.790 --> 02:33:52.640
<v Speaker 1>Do you think my bladder has changed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It must've changed a.</v>

3392
02:33:52.750 --> 02:33:57.750
<v Speaker 1>This is not stuff that I was born with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just from doing three hour </v>

3393
02:33:57.750 --> 02:34:00.030
<v Speaker 1>podcasts like like right now if I had to</v>
<v Speaker 1>pee it will be a struggle.</v>

3394
02:34:00.990 --> 02:34:03.930
<v Speaker 1>I've been sitting here drinking coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a glass of whiskey with him,</v>

3395
02:34:04.020 --> 02:34:06.900
<v Speaker 1>Jack and coke diet coke of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because of my diet.</v>

3396
02:34:07.020 --> 02:34:08.690
<v Speaker 1>Like a truck driver?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3397
02:34:08.760 --> 02:34:09.960
<v Speaker 1>developed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder.</v>

3398
02:34:10.050 --> 02:34:15.050
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to have a competition with </v>
<v Speaker 1>truck drivers so who could hold their </v>

3399
02:34:15.050 --> 02:34:15.930
<v Speaker 1>pis longer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They could pull over though.</v>

3400
02:34:16.320 --> 02:34:18.400
<v Speaker 1>Truck driver could pull over like two </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours in.</v>

3401
02:34:18.401 --> 02:34:20.980
<v Speaker 1>Just pull over man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've left podcast before.</v>

3402
02:34:20.981 --> 02:34:22.480
<v Speaker 1>I have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've timed it poorly.</v>

3403
02:34:22.630 --> 02:34:27.630
<v Speaker 1>You know what it is if I don't pee right</v>
<v Speaker 1>before the show it could get because </v>

3404
02:34:27.630 --> 02:34:29.890
<v Speaker 1>then I might've gotten it hours without </v>
<v Speaker 1>peeing.</v>

3405
02:34:30.070 --> 02:34:31.480
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't break the seal.</v>

3406
02:34:31.580 --> 02:34:34.160
<v Speaker 1>You know like when you eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're drinking first,</v>

3407
02:34:34.340 --> 02:34:36.070
<v Speaker 1>then you gotta go every 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 minutes.</v>

3408
02:34:36.071 --> 02:34:39.220
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it happens to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

3409
02:34:39.370 --> 02:34:43.150
<v Speaker 1>It got the UFC event one time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't have gone at all.</v>

3410
02:34:43.151 --> 02:34:44.770
<v Speaker 1>I have just held it will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3411
02:34:44.771 --> 02:34:47.710
<v Speaker 1>where it breaks me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>monster energy drinks.</v>

3412
02:34:48.130 --> 02:34:53.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't drink those fuckers anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the UFC they have those and </v>

3413
02:34:53.130 --> 02:34:55.780
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing six hours of commentary,</v>

3414
02:34:56.200 --> 02:34:58.290
<v Speaker 1>you want a little caffeine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

3415
02:34:58.360 --> 02:35:03.360
<v Speaker 1>I would have those monsters and man that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have to piss like within an </v>

3416
02:35:03.360 --> 02:35:03.430
<v Speaker 1>hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

3417
02:35:03.431 --> 02:35:08.431
<v Speaker 1>Like there's some stuff in them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there are some form of a diuretic </v>

3418
02:35:08.431 --> 02:35:10.540
<v Speaker 1>in some way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you would know this.</v>

3419
02:35:10.541 --> 02:35:13.990
<v Speaker 1>I looked up something yesterday when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was eating a burrito on a hot sauce.</v>

3420
02:35:14.230 --> 02:35:16.430
<v Speaker 1>There's something called Xantham gum and</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3421
02:35:16.500 --> 02:35:18.790
<v Speaker 1>and it was like a thickening agent is </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I read.</v>

3422
02:35:19.330 --> 02:35:21.580
<v Speaker 1>But when I was looking on the wikipedia </v>
<v Speaker 1>about Xantham Gum,</v>

3423
02:35:21.640 --> 02:35:24.220
<v Speaker 1>it says it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's used as a heavy,</v>

3424
02:35:24.221 --> 02:35:27.070
<v Speaker 1>a laxative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

3425
02:35:27.150 --> 02:35:32.150
<v Speaker 1>Then in my head I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's what's making people shit </v>

3426
02:35:32.150 --> 02:35:32.880
<v Speaker 1>themselves with a lot of hot sauces that</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the hot sauce could be.</v>

3427
02:35:33.550 --> 02:35:38.550
<v Speaker 1>Could be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a reaction that your </v>

3428
02:35:38.550 --> 02:35:42.601
<v Speaker 1>body has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your stomach has to hot sauce to your </v>

3429
02:35:42.601 --> 02:35:42.601
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what in the fuck?</v>

3430
02:35:42.790 --> 02:35:46.480
<v Speaker 1>And that makes you shit yourself to not </v>
<v Speaker 1>really necessarily shit yourself as much</v>

3431
02:35:46.481 --> 02:35:51.481
<v Speaker 1>as have to take a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How the hell did you get their bladder </v>

3432
02:35:51.481 --> 02:35:54.760
<v Speaker 1>control?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Drinking hot sauce.</v>

3433
02:35:54.790 --> 02:35:56.770
<v Speaker 1>Xantham gum out of the room for 30 </v>
<v Speaker 1>seconds.</v>

3434
02:35:57.520 --> 02:35:59.080
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've actually,</v>

3435
02:35:59.081 --> 02:36:01.690
<v Speaker 1>while I was kind of the toilet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just remembered pirates.</v>

3436
02:36:01.810 --> 02:36:04.150
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know why they have the earrings?</v>

3437
02:36:04.151 --> 02:36:05.140
<v Speaker 1>The Golden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they're gay.</v>

3438
02:36:05.141 --> 02:36:07.540
<v Speaker 1>They're all gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well actually you offered it right?</v>

3439
02:36:07.541 --> 02:36:10.390
<v Speaker 1>But they did say we're going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sexuality is a big part of it.</v>

3440
02:36:10.420 --> 02:36:12.090
<v Speaker 1>Well that was why they would do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they were.</v>

3441
02:36:12.110 --> 02:36:14.200
<v Speaker 1>They would discuss why they dress so </v>
<v Speaker 1>flamboyantly.</v>

3442
02:36:15.070 --> 02:36:20.070
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's not why they were gold </v>

3443
02:36:20.070 --> 02:36:20.070
<v Speaker 1>earrings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3444
02:36:20.070 --> 02:36:20.860
<v Speaker 1>it was actually payment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Full burial.</v>

3445
02:36:20.920 --> 02:36:25.920
<v Speaker 1>So when you got washed over overboard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you end up floating up on a beach </v>

3446
02:36:25.920 --> 02:36:25.920
<v Speaker 1>somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd go bury you in.</v>

3447
02:36:25.920 --> 02:36:27.080
<v Speaker 1>Then take the gold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the golden.</v>

3448
02:36:27.880 --> 02:36:29.250
<v Speaker 1>That's a good deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3449
02:36:29.530 --> 02:36:31.960
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was just to look cool.</v>

3450
02:36:32.320 --> 02:36:34.870
<v Speaker 1>Look like a bad ass with scarf was </v>
<v Speaker 1>women.</v>

3451
02:36:34.930 --> 02:36:37.710
<v Speaker 1>It was the oldest game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>

3452
02:36:37.720 --> 02:36:40.540
<v Speaker 1>There was women pirates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to be a woman pirate though,</v>

3453
02:36:40.541 --> 02:36:43.180
<v Speaker 1>you had to be able to be able to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>away with.</v>

3454
02:36:43.210 --> 02:36:48.210
<v Speaker 1>You had to look like a male basically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had to be able to get away with </v>

3455
02:36:48.210 --> 02:36:48.210
<v Speaker 1>giving away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3456
02:36:48.290 --> 02:36:53.290
<v Speaker 1>it'd be like a softball player and type </v>
<v Speaker 1>chick really likes crossfit thick neck </v>

3457
02:36:56.740 --> 02:36:59.200
<v Speaker 1>ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Still Very womanly,</v>

3458
02:36:59.201 --> 02:37:02.820
<v Speaker 1>but large style after traveling the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world for,</v>

3459
02:37:02.890 --> 02:37:07.890
<v Speaker 1>for while the last few years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really big fan of yoga pants on </v>

3460
02:37:07.890 --> 02:37:08.110
<v Speaker 1>airplanes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes.</v>

3461
02:37:09.210 --> 02:37:10.660
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They figured it out.</v>

3462
02:37:10.661 --> 02:37:11.290
<v Speaker 1>They figured it out.</v>

3463
02:37:11.290 --> 02:37:14.640
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing that it took so long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now girls would just rocking them.</v>

3464
02:37:14.641 --> 02:37:16.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitch,</v>

3465
02:37:16.041 --> 02:37:21.041
<v Speaker 1>you ain't going to yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just want everybody to senior </v>

<v Speaker 1>How dare you walk around.</v>

3467
02:37:21.041 --> 02:37:25.960
<v Speaker 1>But men can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you walk around with Yoga Pants and </v>

3468
02:37:25.960 --> 02:37:26.290
<v Speaker 1>your shaft is just bulging the front of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your pants,</v>

3469
02:37:26.330 --> 02:37:29.870
<v Speaker 1>people would think you're rude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's quite fine and dandy.</v>

3470
02:37:29.920 --> 02:37:34.920
<v Speaker 1>It's sexist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're asked to be plump and right </v>

3471
02:37:34.920 --> 02:37:37.250
<v Speaker 1>there and all juicy and inviting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you can have your,</v>

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your man bits compressed and front and </v>

3473
02:37:42.251 --> 02:37:42.251

3474
02:37:42.251 --> 02:37:44.780
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least on a plane full of people,</v>

3475
02:37:44.820 --> 02:37:49.820
<v Speaker 1>which is not acceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A man can't walk around with Yoga Pants </v>

3476
02:37:49.820 --> 02:37:49.820
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very few do,</v>

3477
02:37:49.820 --> 02:37:50.390
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3478
02:37:50.391 --> 02:37:52.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think I could pull it off.</v>

3479
02:37:52.760 --> 02:37:57.760
<v Speaker 1>It's an argument for a large fanny pack </v>
<v Speaker 1>yoga pants and a large fanny pack for a </v>

3480
02:37:57.760 --> 02:37:57.760
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3481
02:37:57.760 --> 02:37:58.230
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is behind that thing?</v>

3482
02:37:58.880 --> 02:38:02.360
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't you like to know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My eyes are up here fucker.</v>

3483
02:38:02.800 --> 02:38:03.560
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fanny pack.</v>

3484
02:38:03.561 --> 02:38:04.790
<v Speaker 1>That just cracks me up when you say </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

3485
02:38:05.090 --> 02:38:10.090
<v Speaker 1>but because you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Vagina is a vagina in England and </v>

3486
02:38:10.090 --> 02:38:14.890
<v Speaker 1>Australia as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But also we wouldn't be caught dead </v>

3487
02:38:14.890 --> 02:38:14.890
<v Speaker 1>wearing an actual fanny pack bumbag </v>
<v Speaker 1>would it be?</v>

3488
02:38:15.310 --> 02:38:17.520
<v Speaker 1>And then just not fashionable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3489
02:38:17.540 --> 02:38:19.790
<v Speaker 1>I wear one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wait one all the time.</v>

3490
02:38:19.820 --> 02:38:22.760
<v Speaker 1>I could see it's being useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

3491
02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:28.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're not trying to get laid when </v>

3492
02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:28.000
<v Speaker 1>just rocket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you want one?</v>

3493
02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:28.000
<v Speaker 1>I have them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to get laid.</v>

3494
02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:32.840
<v Speaker 1>So should we talk about climate change?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that something that you want to bring</v>

3495
02:38:35.871 --> 02:38:40.871
<v Speaker 1>up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just amazed at how many tangents </v>

3496
02:38:40.871 --> 02:38:40.871
<v Speaker 1>you've been able to go on in the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>few hours.</v>

3497
02:38:41.090 --> 02:38:42.950
<v Speaker 1>It's impressive where you're in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>with me.</v>

3498
02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:43.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

3499
02:38:43.490 --> 02:38:44.440
<v Speaker 1>It's both our faults.</v>

3500
02:38:44.470 --> 02:38:45.660
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3501
02:38:46.100 --> 02:38:48.110
<v Speaker 1>so I don't know how much to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

3502
02:38:48.111 --> 02:38:50.270
<v Speaker 1>Like you've got such an intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience either.</v>

3503
02:38:50.320 --> 02:38:51.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

3504
02:38:51.860 --> 02:38:55.100
<v Speaker 1>don't get too crazy little monkeys out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there listening to.</v>

3505
02:38:55.610 --> 02:38:59.990
<v Speaker 1>So I guess first thing is don't shoot </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Messenger.</v>

3506
02:39:00.020 --> 02:39:01.790
<v Speaker 1>Normally when someone starts talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about climate change,</v>

3507
02:39:01.791 --> 02:39:05.480
<v Speaker 1>they look for reasons to shoot them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically you need to,</v>

3508
02:39:05.720 --> 02:39:10.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got such a political aspect to it </v>

3509
02:39:10.720 --> 02:39:11.780
<v Speaker 1>and let you got to disassociate that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>just look at the science,</v>

3510
02:39:11.781 --> 02:39:13.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also take the whole.</v>

3511
02:39:13.281 --> 02:39:15.620
<v Speaker 1>I hate the word belief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe in climate change.</v>

3512
02:39:15.621 --> 02:39:18.980
<v Speaker 1>Well two plus two equals four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you believe it's fine.</v>

3513
02:39:19.010 --> 02:39:20.800
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't really change the fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3514
02:39:21.440 --> 02:39:23.330
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got a whole lecture on this.</v>

3515
02:39:23.331 --> 02:39:25.310
<v Speaker 1>So I do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you do ted talks on this?</v>

3516
02:39:25.620 --> 02:39:26.300
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had,</v>

3517
02:39:26.301 --> 02:39:26.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

3518
02:39:26.710 --> 02:39:28.190
<v Speaker 1>to Chada on board the ship.</v>

3519
02:39:28.220 --> 02:39:33.220
<v Speaker 1>We had a mission Bluetooth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was all trying to ocean </v>

3520
02:39:33.220 --> 02:39:33.220
<v Speaker 1>conservation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sylvia Earle,</v>

3521
02:39:33.220 --> 02:39:33.980
<v Speaker 1>heads of Ted talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fascinating.</v>

3522
02:39:34.010 --> 02:39:35.210
<v Speaker 1>Fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3523
02:39:36.080 --> 02:39:36.470
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3524
02:39:36.471 --> 02:39:37.970
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just listened to them basically.</v>

3525
02:39:38.450 --> 02:39:40.610
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then you have climate,</v>

3526
02:39:40.640 --> 02:39:43.730
<v Speaker 1>which is what a big mistake people make </v>
<v Speaker 1>is they go,</v>

3527
02:39:43.790 --> 02:39:44.510
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's weather,</v>

3528
02:39:44.511 --> 02:39:45.470
<v Speaker 1>it's cold outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3529
02:39:45.471 --> 02:39:50.471
<v Speaker 1>that's climate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Climate is weather over very large </v>

3530
02:39:50.471 --> 02:39:52.670
<v Speaker 1>timescales and that's a big one that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people get wrong straight away.</v>

3531
02:39:53.060 --> 02:39:54.830
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you look at,</v>

3532
02:39:55.580 --> 02:40:00.580
<v Speaker 1>say 14,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>peer reviewed articles about climate </v>

3533
02:40:00.580 --> 02:40:03.881
<v Speaker 1>change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's only 24 that reject global </v>

3534
02:40:03.881 --> 02:40:03.881
<v Speaker 1>warming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to have this whole thing,</v>

3535
02:40:03.881 --> 02:40:05.420
<v Speaker 1>there's a debate going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no debate.</v>

3536
02:40:05.450 --> 02:40:07.190
<v Speaker 1>There's a debate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty four people debate.</v>

3537
02:40:07.720 --> 02:40:08.510
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're saying.</v>

3538
02:40:08.900 --> 02:40:11.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm just joking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've seen the documentary,</v>

3539
02:40:11.541 --> 02:40:13.870
<v Speaker 1>I assume merchants of doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3540
02:40:14.560 --> 02:40:16.050
<v Speaker 1>I think that one might have ms.me</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually.</v>

3541
02:40:16.200 --> 02:40:21.200
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had Michael Shermer in here who's the </v>

3542
02:40:21.200 --> 02:40:21.640
<v Speaker 1>head of skeptic magazine magazine.</v>

3543
02:40:21.650 --> 02:40:26.650
<v Speaker 1>Michael Shermer is a pretty famous </v>
<v Speaker 1>skeptic and he was with the skip toy </v>

3544
02:40:26.650 --> 02:40:26.880
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ripped him a new one.</v>

3545
02:40:26.881 --> 02:40:30.300
<v Speaker 1>That was guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did it himself a full.</v>

3546
02:40:30.610 --> 02:40:33.060
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but schermer is much more reasonable and</v>

3547
02:40:33.061 --> 02:40:34.470
<v Speaker 1>intelligent man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he was,</v>

3548
02:40:34.471 --> 02:40:39.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about this documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We actually brought it up.</v>

3549
02:40:39.050 --> 02:40:44.050
<v Speaker 1>I forgot that he was in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a documentary where it showed </v>

3550
02:40:44.050 --> 02:40:47.661
<v Speaker 1>that the same people that were spreading</v>
<v Speaker 1>misinformation that were actually paid </v>

3551
02:40:48.060 --> 02:40:50.910
<v Speaker 1>to spread misinformation about </v>
<v Speaker 1>cigarettes,</v>

3552
02:40:51.090 --> 02:40:55.110
<v Speaker 1>about cigarettes being addictive were </v>
<v Speaker 1>the very same people that were spreading</v>

3553
02:40:55.111 --> 02:40:57.450
<v Speaker 1>misinformation about climate change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People will sell outfit.</v>

3554
02:40:57.580 --> 02:40:58.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

3555
02:40:58.771 --> 02:41:00.690
<v Speaker 1>And they're just good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're good at bullshit.</v>

3556
02:41:00.691 --> 02:41:01.900
<v Speaker 1>Those 20 full people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3557
02:41:02.070 --> 02:41:04.060
<v Speaker 1>You look into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all paid by the state,</v>

3558
02:41:04.100 --> 02:41:06.210
<v Speaker 1>by the oil petroleum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a little bit.</v>

3559
02:41:06.440 --> 02:41:08.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I mean you and me,</v>

3560
02:41:08.131 --> 02:41:10.020
<v Speaker 1>we now and the whole world kind of come </v>
<v Speaker 1>around to,</v>

3561
02:41:10.021 --> 02:41:11.850
<v Speaker 1>in the last two years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world is warming.</v>

3562
02:41:11.880 --> 02:41:16.880
<v Speaker 1>We know this well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter which way you look at what's </v>

3563
02:41:16.880 --> 02:41:16.880
<v Speaker 1>happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something's going on and people normally</v>

3564
02:41:16.880 --> 02:41:16.880
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh well that's,</v>

3565
02:41:16.880 --> 02:41:19.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>solar and stuff like that going on.</v>

3566
02:41:19.021 --> 02:41:23.250
<v Speaker 1>But if you remove the solo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know from the equation,</v>

3567
02:41:23.310 --> 02:41:28.310
<v Speaker 1>it's still going up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still going up because we </v>

3568
02:41:28.310 --> 02:41:30.711
<v Speaker 1>understand the soul cycle's quite well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've done a lot of research on them so </v>

3569
02:41:30.711 --> 02:41:34.581
<v Speaker 1>we know what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the other thing that people </v>

3570
02:41:34.581 --> 02:41:34.581
<v Speaker 1>always say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3571
02:41:34.581 --> 02:41:36.930
<v Speaker 1>it's happened over and over again </v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout history,</v>

3572
02:41:36.960 --> 02:41:39.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so this one's 800,000</v>

3573
02:41:39.301 --> 02:41:44.301
<v Speaker 1>years and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see it psychically going up and </v>

3574
02:41:44.301 --> 02:41:46.521
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I always like to look at the </v>

3575
02:41:46.521 --> 02:41:48.831
<v Speaker 1>averages and the average is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is kind of CEO to with an average and </v>

3576
02:41:48.831 --> 02:41:50.910
<v Speaker 1>maybe to 25 parts per million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what we're up to now,</v>

3577
02:41:51.150 --> 02:41:53.970
<v Speaker 1>what were like 403 at the moment.</v>

3578
02:41:54.840 --> 02:41:56.520
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the average been to 50,</v>

3579
02:41:56.580 --> 02:41:59.670
<v Speaker 1>never got higher than 300 and we now are</v>
<v Speaker 1>at 400 or something.</v>

3580
02:41:59.671 --> 02:42:03.150
<v Speaker 1>So we're off the charts when it comes to</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and temperature the same.</v>

3581
02:42:03.151 --> 02:42:05.250
<v Speaker 1>It's always been a little colder than it</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually is today.</v>

3582
02:42:05.670 --> 02:42:09.240
<v Speaker 1>And that's just because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>earth rotating around the sun.</v>

3583
02:42:09.241 --> 02:42:11.460
<v Speaker 1>A little bit of progression here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit of a tilt here.</v>

3584
02:42:11.510 --> 02:42:16.510
<v Speaker 1>We understand this quite well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise we won't be able to make </v>

3585
02:42:16.510 --> 02:42:17.550
<v Speaker 1>observations of the skies as closely as </v>
<v Speaker 1>we do.</v>

3586
02:42:18.750 --> 02:42:20.340
<v Speaker 1>So people always go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes it's solar,</v>

3587
02:42:20.341 --> 02:42:23.890
<v Speaker 1>but if you look at solar since 1960,</v>
<v Speaker 1>70,</v>

3588
02:42:24.030 --> 02:42:26.790
<v Speaker 1>it's been going down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the amount of solar radiation,</v>

3589
02:42:26.791 --> 02:42:31.791
<v Speaker 1>the amount of energy that Sun's putting </v>
<v Speaker 1>out that hits planet earth has been </v>

3590
02:42:31.791 --> 02:42:32.760
<v Speaker 1>going down and yet temperature has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>going up big time.</v>

3591
02:42:33.180 --> 02:42:35.820
<v Speaker 1>So right there you kind of can get away </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the whole.</v>

3592
02:42:36.180 --> 02:42:41.180
<v Speaker 1>It's just natural cycles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something's really going on that's not </v>

3593
02:42:41.180 --> 02:42:41.910
<v Speaker 1>meant to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so as of last year,</v>

3594
02:42:41.911 --> 02:42:46.911
<v Speaker 1>we crossed 400 parts per million co two </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the atmosphere and actually between </v>

3595
02:42:46.911 --> 02:42:48.540
<v Speaker 1>look at that spike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

3596
02:42:49.200 --> 02:42:53.340
<v Speaker 1>From the 19 tens to 2015,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is from 400,000</v>

3597
02:42:53.341 --> 02:42:54.060
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3598
02:42:54.090 --> 02:42:55.590
<v Speaker 1>but I mean the last spike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

3599
02:42:55.730 --> 02:42:57.750
<v Speaker 1>Which shows 19.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ten to 2015.</v>

3600
02:42:57.751 --> 02:42:59.890
<v Speaker 1>That's when it goes completely vertical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3601
02:43:00.280 --> 02:43:01.260
<v Speaker 1>Straight up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>straight up.</v>

3602
02:43:01.710 --> 02:43:06.710
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean even in the last 12 months we've </v>

3603
02:43:06.710 --> 02:43:06.710
<v Speaker 1>had the sharpest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rosin Sio two as well,</v>

3604
02:43:06.710 --> 02:43:08.490
<v Speaker 1>have about just under three parts per </v>
<v Speaker 1>million.</v>

3605
02:43:08.760 --> 02:43:12.040
<v Speaker 1>So it's still increasing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not slowing</v>

3606
02:43:12.040 --> 02:43:14.020
<v Speaker 2>down at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's actually increasing big time.</v>

3607
02:43:14.970 --> 02:43:17.820
<v Speaker 3>Spike is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's weird to look at.</v>

3608
02:43:18.270 --> 02:43:23.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a rocket ship taking off </v>

3609
02:43:23.270 --> 02:43:23.270
<v Speaker 3>straight up in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anytime you see this,</v>

3610
02:43:23.270 --> 02:43:24.600
<v Speaker 3>you know any scientist sees this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>

3611
02:43:24.840 --> 02:43:26.310
<v Speaker 3>that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not normal.</v>

3612
02:43:26.311 --> 02:43:27.900
<v Speaker 3>That's not what things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A cyclic.</v>

3613
02:43:27.901 --> 02:43:29.570
<v Speaker 3>They don't just go the hockey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

3614
02:43:29.571 --> 02:43:34.571
<v Speaker 3>You got hockey stick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember when an inconvenient </v>

3615
02:43:34.571 --> 02:43:36.711
<v Speaker 3>truth came out and so many people were </v>
<v Speaker 3>attacking Al Gore immediately </v>

3616
02:43:36.711 --> 02:43:36.711
<v Speaker 3>afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boy,</v>

3617
02:43:36.711 --> 02:43:37.830
<v Speaker 3>those conservatives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they fucking piled on.</v>

3618
02:43:38.250 --> 02:43:40.980
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like they were just trying </v>
<v Speaker 3>to avoid the information,</v>

3619
02:43:40.981 --> 02:43:45.981
<v Speaker 3>getting out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just trying to keep business as usual </v>

3620
02:43:45.981 --> 02:43:48.171
<v Speaker 3>for as long as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't wondered what's the world we </v>

3621
02:43:48.171 --> 02:43:49.470
<v Speaker 3>currently live in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If our goal became president.</v>

3622
02:43:49.810 --> 02:43:53.200
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he should've fucked over that.</v>

3623
02:43:53.201 --> 02:43:55.320
<v Speaker 3>That was one of the weirdest elections </v>
<v Speaker 3>that were like,</v>

3624
02:43:55.321 --> 02:43:55.620
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3625
02:43:55.621 --> 02:43:56.460
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know you won,</v>

3626
02:43:56.461 --> 02:44:00.280
<v Speaker 3>but whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>George Bush's second term come out,</v>

3627
02:44:03.170 --> 02:44:05.290
<v Speaker 3>we never get rid of a president in wool.</v>

3628
02:44:05.310 --> 02:44:10.310
<v Speaker 3>Do you always have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They always get to terms with is John </v>

3629
02:44:10.310 --> 02:44:10.360
<v Speaker 3>Curry was the second term,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3630
02:44:10.710 --> 02:44:12.430
<v Speaker 3>It was Al Gore was the first one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3631
02:44:13.480 --> 02:44:18.480
<v Speaker 3>Wasn't it a algorithm?</v>
<v Speaker 3>An algorithm running against him the </v>

3632
02:44:18.480 --> 02:44:18.480
<v Speaker 3>first time and then John Kerry did the </v>
<v Speaker 3>second time.</v>

3633
02:44:18.480 --> 02:44:20.340
<v Speaker 3>Was that what it was?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And even John Kerry,</v>

3634
02:44:20.341 --> 02:44:23.610
<v Speaker 3>there was some fuckery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was some fuckery when it came to,</v>

3635
02:44:23.670 --> 02:44:24.700
<v Speaker 3>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you ever.</v>

3636
02:44:24.780 --> 02:44:26.310
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's totally different subject,</v>

3637
02:44:26.311 --> 02:44:31.311
<v Speaker 3>but there was a fantastic hbo </v>
<v Speaker 3>documentary on called Hacking Democracy </v>

3638
02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:38.000
<v Speaker 3>and it was all about how these diebold </v>
<v Speaker 3>machines that were created these </v>

3639
02:44:38.221 --> 02:44:40.800
<v Speaker 3>election counting machines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

3640
02:44:41.380 --> 02:44:43.850
<v Speaker 3>they were huge contributors to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Republican Party,</v>

3641
02:44:43.890 --> 02:44:47.100
<v Speaker 3>the diebold corporation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which changed her name afterwards,</v>

3642
02:44:47.490 --> 02:44:51.360
<v Speaker 3>but they also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they engineered some sort of a back door</v>

3643
02:44:51.390 --> 02:44:56.390
<v Speaker 3>into the system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like clearly there could be hacked and </v>

3644
02:44:56.390 --> 02:44:57.270
<v Speaker 3>they showed it like without doubt on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>show,</v>

3645
02:44:57.450 --> 02:45:02.450
<v Speaker 3>on the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the documentary that you can hack </v>

3646
02:45:02.450 --> 02:45:04.760
<v Speaker 3>these machines and alter the results.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And these are the machines that they </v>

3647
02:45:04.760 --> 02:45:07.120
<v Speaker 3>used.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One Swish became president of receipts,</v>

3648
02:45:07.590 --> 02:45:11.310
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then remember the Dang d dangling Chads,</v>

3649
02:45:11.460 --> 02:45:12.060
<v Speaker 3>whoever it was.</v>

3650
02:45:13.220 --> 02:45:14.450
<v Speaker 2>It's messed up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's missed.</v>

3651
02:45:14.480 --> 02:45:14.890
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3652
02:45:14.900 --> 02:45:15.780
<v Speaker 2>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3653
02:45:16.070 --> 02:45:18.260
<v Speaker 2>so I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>temperatures are rising.</v>

3654
02:45:18.261 --> 02:45:20.420
<v Speaker 2>We notice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I said,</v>

3655
02:45:20.540 --> 02:45:25.540
<v Speaker 2>worldwide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're about one point five at </v>

3656
02:45:25.540 --> 02:45:27.821
<v Speaker 2>the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>degrees above preindustrial northern </v>

3657
02:45:27.821 --> 02:45:28.610
<v Speaker 2>hemisphere to at the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So where are they going?</v>

3658
02:45:28.850 --> 02:45:33.850
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that going towards about six degrees by </v>

3659
02:45:33.850 --> 02:45:33.850
<v Speaker 2>the end of the century.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Six.</v>

3660
02:45:33.850 --> 02:45:34.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you'll talk to people and they'll get</v>

3661
02:45:34.820 --> 02:45:36.300
<v Speaker 2>four point five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3662
02:45:36.350 --> 02:45:38.060
<v Speaker 2>any climate scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get this all the time,</v>

3663
02:45:38.061 --> 02:45:41.950
<v Speaker 2>so you to tell me what's going to happen</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the end of the century and they got a</v>

3664
02:45:41.990 --> 02:45:46.990
<v Speaker 2>four point five degrees Celsius </v>
<v Speaker 2>temperature rise and then you have a </v>

3665
02:45:46.990 --> 02:45:46.990
<v Speaker 2>drink with them afterwards and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3666
02:45:46.990 --> 02:45:51.020
<v Speaker 2>well I can prove four point five to 99 </v>
<v Speaker 2>point nine,</v>

3667
02:45:51.021 --> 02:45:56.021
<v Speaker 2>nine percent probability,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can prove six at 92 percent </v>

3668
02:45:56.271 --> 02:45:57.630
<v Speaker 2>probability,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

3669
02:45:57.650 --> 02:46:01.370
<v Speaker 2>And so they don't ever print it because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they can't be 100 percent certain.</v>

3670
02:46:01.371 --> 02:46:06.371
<v Speaker 2>This is a few more variables.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They need more data that need more </v>

3671
02:46:06.371 --> 02:46:06.371
<v Speaker 2>research.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They need more calculate.</v>

3672
02:46:06.371 --> 02:46:07.310
<v Speaker 2>That's the real number.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's actually where it's heading.</v>

3673
02:46:07.311 --> 02:46:09.110
<v Speaker 2>So that's why you get these great </v>
<v Speaker 2>graphs.</v>

3674
02:46:09.260 --> 02:46:10.010
<v Speaker 2>You see this</v>

3675
02:46:10.010 --> 02:46:11.450
<v Speaker 1>graph here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a few years old.</v>

3676
02:46:11.451 --> 02:46:11.960
<v Speaker 1>It says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3677
02:46:11.961 --> 02:46:13.940
<v Speaker 1>it may only get to one point five </v>
<v Speaker 1>degrees.</v>

3678
02:46:13.941 --> 02:46:18.941
<v Speaker 1>We were already there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the lowest end of this is already </v>

3679
02:46:18.941 --> 02:46:19.330
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The higher end is,</v>

3680
02:46:19.331 --> 02:46:23.330
<v Speaker 1>is is about six degrees depending on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>different research that you do,</v>

3681
02:46:23.750 --> 02:46:28.750
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's just good that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>realize that scientist won't publish </v>

3682
02:46:28.750 --> 02:46:32.501
<v Speaker 1>something unless they're 100 percent </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain on something and so there's a </v>

3683
02:46:32.501 --> 02:46:32.720
<v Speaker 1>lot of things that they're pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain on.</v>

3684
02:46:33.020 --> 02:46:38.020
<v Speaker 1>They'll tell you over a drink later on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they weren't published it and that </v>

3685
02:46:38.020 --> 02:46:40.741
<v Speaker 1>generally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why every year it seems to get </v>

3686
02:46:40.741 --> 02:46:42.851
<v Speaker 1>worse and worse than predictions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm positive proof of global warming is </v>

3687
02:46:44.470 --> 02:46:47.970
<v Speaker 1>visual visual joke than anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] I don't think.</v>

3688
02:46:48.180 --> 02:46:51.110
<v Speaker 1>I think that people found out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People look better.</v>

3689
02:46:51.320 --> 02:46:53.160
<v Speaker 1>Those little tiny underwear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

3690
02:46:53.630 --> 02:46:58.630
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the vast majority of the people that </v>

3691
02:46:58.630 --> 02:46:59.210
<v Speaker 1>enjoy this show.</v>

3692
02:46:59.720 --> 02:47:03.110
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to talk about it more than 90</v>

3693
02:47:03.111 --> 02:47:04.940
<v Speaker 1>percent so that that picture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

3694
02:47:04.941 --> 02:47:08.180
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck did they see?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just an old school bloomers from</v>

3695
02:47:08.181 --> 02:47:13.181
<v Speaker 1>the 19 hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>early 19 hundreds to the little tiny </v>

3696
02:47:13.181 --> 02:47:14.420
<v Speaker 1>bikini underwear that the young ladies </v>
<v Speaker 1>like to wear today,</v>

3697
02:47:15.450 --> 02:47:18.380
<v Speaker 1>which I support.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a global warming is bringing us.</v>

3698
02:47:18.560 --> 02:47:23.370
<v Speaker 1>He Ha fucking fire up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The higher up the carbon out.</v>

3699
02:47:23.410 --> 02:47:26.750
<v Speaker 1>Skip through this as quickly as I can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>

3700
02:47:26.751 --> 02:47:31.751
<v Speaker 1>Why is this all happening while we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>pumping out non billion tons of carbon </v>

3701
02:47:31.751 --> 02:47:32.720
<v Speaker 1>dioxide per year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the vast,</v>

3702
02:47:32.870 --> 02:47:37.870
<v Speaker 1>what I like about this graph is that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can see that about three and a half </v>

3703
02:47:37.870 --> 02:47:42.280
<v Speaker 1>billion tons is actually coming from </v>
<v Speaker 1>coal and about three and a half from </v>

3704
02:47:42.280 --> 02:47:44.981
<v Speaker 1>petroleum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it actually just removing coal from </v>

3705
02:47:44.981 --> 02:47:46.970
<v Speaker 1>the equation is like a third more than.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's China is a big one,</v>

3706
02:47:46.971 --> 02:47:47.200
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3707
02:47:47.590 --> 02:47:52.590
<v Speaker 1>He's straight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got heaps of coal fire power </v>

3708
02:47:52.590 --> 02:47:52.880
<v Speaker 1>plants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia will America has some as well,</v>

3709
02:47:53.300 --> 02:47:54.590
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But China is a,</v>

3710
02:47:54.600 --> 02:47:55.940
<v Speaker 1>they have a huge problem with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3711
02:47:56.500 --> 02:47:58.580
<v Speaker 1>You need an ancient technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3712
02:47:58.581 --> 02:48:01.100
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got much better stuff these days.</v>

3713
02:48:01.130 --> 02:48:06.130
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead of just going over these graphs </v>

3714
02:48:06.130 --> 02:48:06.130
<v Speaker 1>and showing how we're fucked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what can be done?</v>

3715
02:48:06.130 --> 02:48:07.430
<v Speaker 1>Is there something that can be done?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>

3716
02:48:07.490 --> 02:48:10.430
<v Speaker 1>do you have a solution yet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adam crop for president of the world.</v>

3717
02:48:11.530 --> 02:48:12.980
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't put up with politicians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3718
02:48:13.010 --> 02:48:14.240
<v Speaker 1>You could put.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3719
02:48:14.241 --> 02:48:15.110
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3720
02:48:15.140 --> 02:48:20.140
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can just skip straightforward to the </v>

3721
02:48:20.140 --> 02:48:20.140
<v Speaker 1>solutions if you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we have to ride horses or no,</v>

3722
02:48:20.140 --> 02:48:20.140
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3723
02:48:20.180 --> 02:48:20.870
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3724
02:48:20.900 --> 02:48:22.910
<v Speaker 1>just want to point out that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3725
02:48:22.970 --> 02:48:26.270
<v Speaker 1>different things are going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cyclones or hurricanes are getting worse</v>

3726
02:48:26.271 --> 02:48:28.310
<v Speaker 1>and worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The more powerful.</v>

3727
02:48:28.311 --> 02:48:31.580
<v Speaker 1>There's more of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jetstreams messed up.</v>

3728
02:48:31.730 --> 02:48:33.470
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sea level rise.</v>

3729
02:48:33.590 --> 02:48:34.660
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3730
02:48:34.670 --> 02:48:38.360
<v Speaker 1>they say maybe two meters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but once you factor in positive feedback</v>

3731
02:48:38.361 --> 02:48:40.110
<v Speaker 1>loops and stuff like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can be,</v>

3732
02:48:40.340 --> 02:48:43.130
<v Speaker 1>can be significantly higher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you come back to the old mold Steve's</v>

3733
02:48:43.131 --> 02:48:43.750
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3734
02:48:43.810 --> 02:48:44.690
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're gone.</v>

3735
02:48:45.100 --> 02:48:48.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm interesting men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever heard of this guy?</v>

3736
02:48:48.740 --> 02:48:50.660
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was the president of the Maldives.</v>

3737
02:48:50.661 --> 02:48:55.661
<v Speaker 1>He was the first democratically elected </v>
<v Speaker 1>president of 100 percent Muslim country </v>

3738
02:48:55.661 --> 02:48:58.910
<v Speaker 1>to be like carrots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a rabbit out of his teeth.</v>

3739
02:49:02.050 --> 02:49:03.690
<v Speaker 1>He was a marine biologist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's looking at.</v>

3740
02:49:03.691 --> 02:49:05.800
<v Speaker 1>He's biting his lower lip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he's a.</v>

3741
02:49:06.120 --> 02:49:08.050
<v Speaker 1>is that just a weird face?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They caught him,</v>

3742
02:49:08.780 --> 02:49:12.810
<v Speaker 1>but he spent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he spent six years in jail and 18 months</v>

3743
02:49:12.811 --> 02:49:14.130
<v Speaker 1>in solitary confinement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

3744
02:49:14.160 --> 02:49:19.160
<v Speaker 1>For what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>For going for talking about climate </v>

3745
02:49:19.160 --> 02:49:19.160
<v Speaker 1>change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3746
02:49:19.200 --> 02:49:21.660
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to beat him in jail.</v>

3747
02:49:21.960 --> 02:49:26.960
<v Speaker 1>He's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's currently in jail I think at the </v>

3748
02:49:26.960 --> 02:49:26.960
<v Speaker 1>moment for talking about climate change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3749
02:49:26.960 --> 02:49:28.800
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who put them in jail?</v>

3750
02:49:28.980 --> 02:49:33.120
<v Speaker 1>The next president that came in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

3751
02:49:33.570 --> 02:49:36.840
<v Speaker 1>but so what you have is this huge </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential sea level when we go,</v>

3752
02:49:36.860 --> 02:49:37.620
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me does it.</v>

3753
02:49:37.621 --> 02:49:38.460
<v Speaker 1>Most people go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah.</v>

3754
02:49:38.461 --> 02:49:43.461
<v Speaker 1>To me to build a wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever people in Shanghai would </v>

3755
02:49:43.461 --> 02:49:43.461
<v Speaker 1>disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>

3756
02:49:43.461 --> 02:49:45.780
<v Speaker 1>you have the sea level rise potential </v>
<v Speaker 1>with positive feedback loops.</v>

3757
02:49:45.781 --> 02:49:47.760
<v Speaker 1>So water vapor is probably the most well</v>
<v Speaker 1>understood.</v>

3758
02:49:47.761 --> 02:49:48.510
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more,</v>

3759
02:49:48.540 --> 02:49:49.420
<v Speaker 1>more hotter.</v>

3760
02:49:49.440 --> 02:49:54.440
<v Speaker 1>You have the more water vapor you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that cycles back on itself and it </v>

3761
02:49:54.440 --> 02:49:58.221
<v Speaker 1>gets harder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another one is like the permafrost in </v>

3762
02:49:58.221 --> 02:50:00.951
<v Speaker 1>Siberia and stuff like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as this area thor's it really solid </v>

3763
02:50:00.951 --> 02:50:04.260
<v Speaker 1>and methane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then cycles and it gets more and more </v>

3764
02:50:04.260 --> 02:50:04.260
<v Speaker 1>and more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you take this all into account,</v>

3765
02:50:04.770 --> 02:50:08.490
<v Speaker 1>then you get a huge sea level rise of </v>
<v Speaker 1>about 60 meters is the potential of what</v>

3766
02:50:08.491 --> 02:50:10.760
<v Speaker 1>can go on 16 meters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3767
02:50:10.761 --> 02:50:12.090
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six zero,</v>

3768
02:50:12.091 --> 02:50:13.470
<v Speaker 1>60,</v>
<v Speaker 1>60.</v>

3769
02:50:15.360 --> 02:50:18.120
<v Speaker 1>Convert that defeat at your leisure </v>
<v Speaker 1>about 200 feet,</v>

3770
02:50:18.480 --> 02:50:21.240
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but show a graph.</v>

3771
02:50:21.300 --> 02:50:25.290
<v Speaker 1>One thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>show an image of Australia with 60 meter</v>

3772
02:50:25.291 --> 02:50:26.970
<v Speaker 1>sea level rise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas the states there,</v>

3773
02:50:27.870 --> 02:50:30.030
<v Speaker 1>Florida where it's good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but get rid of Florida.</v>

3774
02:50:30.960 --> 02:50:31.680
<v Speaker 1>California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

3775
02:50:31.710 --> 02:50:32.580
<v Speaker 1>has plenty of water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

3776
02:50:32.610 --> 02:50:37.610
<v Speaker 1>problem solved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got a nice little stuff in the </v>

3777
02:50:37.610 --> 02:50:37.610
<v Speaker 1>middle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We a plan in place to live.</v>

3778
02:50:37.610 --> 02:50:41.640
<v Speaker 1>You know stuff in the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no one there anyway,</v>

3779
02:50:41.641 --> 02:50:44.790
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of years gone.</v>

3780
02:50:45.460 --> 02:50:47.100
<v Speaker 1>Good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good riddance.</v>

3781
02:50:47.430 --> 02:50:50.280
<v Speaker 1>Then you also have the ocean </v>
<v Speaker 1>acidification.</v>

3782
02:50:50.281 --> 02:50:52.980
<v Speaker 1>Do you know much about that one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

3783
02:50:53.090 --> 02:50:58.090
<v Speaker 1>I have read about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the more disturbing </v>

3784
02:50:58.090 --> 02:50:59.040
<v Speaker 1>aspects of the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not just ocean acidification,</v>

3785
02:50:59.430 --> 02:51:03.750
<v Speaker 1>but less oxygen and more dead zones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the last time this happened,</v>

3786
02:51:03.751 --> 02:51:06.030
<v Speaker 1>which is it's happening and it's only a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of decades away.</v>

3787
02:51:06.180 --> 02:51:09.450
<v Speaker 1>Ninety six percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>96 percent of the marine species on this</v>

3788
02:51:09.451 --> 02:51:11.160
<v Speaker 1>earth perished.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When was this?</v>

3789
02:51:11.790 --> 02:51:15.630
<v Speaker 1>A 252 million years ago while we bounce </v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

3790
02:51:16.380 --> 02:51:21.380
<v Speaker 1>We did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called the great dying at the </v>

3791
02:51:21.380 --> 02:51:22.380
<v Speaker 1>current trends and what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two thousand and 50.</v>

3792
02:51:22.680 --> 02:51:25.080
<v Speaker 1>We're looking at this ocean </v>
<v Speaker 1>acidification event happening,</v>

3793
02:51:25.081 --> 02:51:28.770
<v Speaker 1>so that means that old coral reefs won't</v>
<v Speaker 1>be able to grow carl anymore.</v>

3794
02:51:28.810 --> 02:51:30.690
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no shellfish can grow shells anymore.</v>

3795
02:51:31.090 --> 02:51:34.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm basically the combined calcium </v>
<v Speaker 1>carbonate out of the water anymore.</v>

3796
02:51:34.320 --> 02:51:39.320
<v Speaker 1>They're basically then the chemistry </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't work anymore and that at the </v>

3797
02:51:39.320 --> 02:51:42.420
<v Speaker 1>moment is looking at 2050 Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's pretty much,</v>

3798
02:51:42.421 --> 02:51:44.330
<v Speaker 1>that's all your fish species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything that's,</v>

3799
02:51:44.530 --> 02:51:48.120
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot of stuff going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw something online about,</v>

3800
02:51:48.210 --> 02:51:53.210
<v Speaker 1>there was a solution that they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>proposing where they would put scrap </v>

3801
02:51:53.210 --> 02:51:58.160
<v Speaker 1>iron all throughout the ocean and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>that would somehow or another attract </v>

3802
02:51:58.160 --> 02:52:02.571
<v Speaker 1>algae and that would uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically seeding a whole heap of life </v>

3803
02:52:02.571 --> 02:52:06.501
<v Speaker 1>to balloon phyto plankton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the base is the start of the </v>

3804
02:52:06.821 --> 02:52:08.500
<v Speaker 1>food chain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going,</v>

3805
02:52:08.501 --> 02:52:13.501
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a whole heap of stuff for you </v>

3806
02:52:13.501 --> 02:52:13.501
<v Speaker 1>that makes you grow faster and bigger </v>
<v Speaker 1>and stronger.</v>

3807
02:52:13.501 --> 02:52:15.730
<v Speaker 1>And so it seeds that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so yeah,</v>

3808
02:52:15.731 --> 02:52:19.270
<v Speaker 1>it will absorb a large amount of co two </v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

3809
02:52:20.230 --> 02:52:22.260
<v Speaker 1>Not Enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

3810
02:52:23.290 --> 02:52:24.180
<v Speaker 1>it's tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

3811
02:52:24.181 --> 02:52:29.181
<v Speaker 1>the ocean is doing a damn good job at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the moment of absorbing a lot of CEO </v>

3812
02:52:29.181 --> 02:52:29.181
<v Speaker 1>two.</v>

3813
02:52:29.181 --> 02:52:33.030
<v Speaker 1>And that's why we have this kind of 40 </v>
<v Speaker 1>year lag thing going on because the </v>

3814
02:52:33.030 --> 02:52:33.040
<v Speaker 1>ocean absorbs a lot of heat and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>heat sink,</v>

3815
02:52:33.070 --> 02:52:34.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>

3816
02:52:34.691 --> 02:52:36.190
<v Speaker 1>this one here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is from,</v>

3817
02:52:36.520 --> 02:52:41.520
<v Speaker 1>this is this month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you've got 12 degrees warmer in the </v>

3818
02:52:41.520 --> 02:52:41.980
<v Speaker 1>top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

3819
02:52:41.981 --> 02:52:46.981
<v Speaker 1>And Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about 12 degrees warmer than standard </v>

3820
02:52:46.981 --> 02:52:51.420
<v Speaker 1>than normal arctic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Arctic basically didn't have a </v>

3821
02:52:51.420 --> 02:52:51.420
<v Speaker 1>winter this year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just stayed.</v>

3822
02:52:51.420 --> 02:52:55.190
<v Speaker 1>Some stayed summer or kind of warm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twelve degrees Celsius warmer than </v>

3823
02:52:55.190 --> 02:52:56.350
<v Speaker 1>usual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

3824
02:52:56.560 --> 02:53:01.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that whole optic ice free sort of </v>

3825
02:53:01.560 --> 02:53:03.220
<v Speaker 1>thing that's not too far away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually not too far away.</v>

3826
02:53:03.480 --> 02:53:06.070
<v Speaker 1>It's closer than you think in Greenland </v>
<v Speaker 1>is thawing very,</v>

3827
02:53:06.071 --> 02:53:07.840
<v Speaker 1>very fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you look at the melts,</v>

3828
02:53:08.290 --> 02:53:10.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over 50 percent of greenland melted last</v>

3829
02:53:10.930 --> 02:53:12.790
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of it refroze thank God,</v>

3830
02:53:12.791 --> 02:53:15.520
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's melting over 50 percent.</v>

3831
02:53:15.640 --> 02:53:20.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a graph in front of your 2015 mil </v>

3832
02:53:20.640 --> 02:53:20.800
<v Speaker 1>percentage was over 50 percent of it </v>
<v Speaker 1>melted.</v>

3833
02:53:21.560 --> 02:53:25.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm normally just over about 20 percent </v>
<v Speaker 1>melts per year,</v>

3834
02:53:25.060 --> 02:53:28.990
<v Speaker 1>but a large portion of melted was </v>
<v Speaker 1>greenland at one point in time.</v>

3835
02:53:28.991 --> 02:53:31.930
<v Speaker 1>Green is that with the reason why they </v>
<v Speaker 1>called the Greenland?</v>

3836
02:53:31.980 --> 02:53:34.360
<v Speaker 1>Just messed up the naming because </v>
<v Speaker 1>Iceland,</v>

3837
02:53:36.070 --> 02:53:37.900
<v Speaker 1>I know Iceland and Greenland should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other way around,</v>

3838
02:53:37.930 --> 02:53:39.970
<v Speaker 1>but aura.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm going there for the first time.</v>

3839
02:53:39.971 --> 02:53:43.480
<v Speaker 1>Actually in June.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go on a national geographic explorer.</v>

3840
02:53:43.481 --> 02:53:45.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing svalbard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iceland,</v>

3841
02:53:45.401 --> 02:53:47.290
<v Speaker 1>Greenland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Super excited.</v>

3842
02:53:47.291 --> 02:53:50.740
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love these charts and graphs,</v>

3843
02:53:50.741 --> 02:53:52.300
<v Speaker 1>but we're almost out of time here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where we're at.</v>

3844
02:53:52.301 --> 02:53:53.470
<v Speaker 1>Three minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What can we do?</v>

3845
02:53:53.770 --> 02:53:54.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3846
02:53:54.251 --> 02:53:55.990
<v Speaker 1>What can we do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3847
02:53:57.630 --> 02:54:00.580
<v Speaker 1>you need to save the children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I prefer save the animals.</v>

3848
02:54:00.640 --> 02:54:02.900
<v Speaker 1>So that's what you like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The animals one,</v>

3849
02:54:02.930 --> 02:54:03.810
<v Speaker 1>the people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

3850
02:54:04.420 --> 02:54:05.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm scared of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Toddlers,</v>

3851
02:54:05.351 --> 02:54:07.480
<v Speaker 1>they kill more people than terrorists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm scared of them.</v>

3852
02:54:07.810 --> 02:54:12.810
<v Speaker 1>Toddlers do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Toddlers in the states kill more people </v>

3853
02:54:12.810 --> 02:54:12.810
<v Speaker 1>in terrorists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3854
02:54:12.810 --> 02:54:13.450
<v Speaker 1>how do they kill people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shoot them.</v>

3855
02:54:13.451 --> 02:54:15.580
<v Speaker 1>Generally know those guns are killing </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

3856
02:54:15.581 --> 02:54:16.630
<v Speaker 1>not toddlers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3857
02:54:19.150 --> 02:54:21.550
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just keep the fucking guns away from the</v>

3858
02:54:21.551 --> 02:54:25.480
<v Speaker 1>tolerance and don't kill anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many people get killed by toddlers?</v>

3859
02:54:26.110 --> 02:54:27.460
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

3860
02:54:27.520 --> 02:54:29.500
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Toddlers with guns.</v>

3861
02:54:29.840 --> 02:54:31.330
<v Speaker 1>Website.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should be a new band.</v>

3862
02:54:31.331 --> 02:54:33.400
<v Speaker 1>Jamey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thinking about a band name.</v>

3863
02:54:33.490 --> 02:54:35.190
<v Speaker 1>Toddlers with guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Toddler.</v>

3864
02:54:35.250 --> 02:54:36.370
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>death by toddler,</v>

3865
02:54:36.610 --> 02:54:38.770
<v Speaker 1>there is a million different things you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can do with climate change.</v>

3866
02:54:38.771 --> 02:54:40.720
<v Speaker 1>There is the thing that most people do </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

3867
02:54:40.840 --> 02:54:42.040
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a great idea.</v>

3868
02:54:42.041 --> 02:54:43.240
<v Speaker 1>We need to do that one idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3869
02:54:43.300 --> 02:54:48.300
<v Speaker 1>we need to do all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need to do them all now and we need </v>

3870
02:54:48.300 --> 02:54:50.740
<v Speaker 1>to do them all 20 years ago basically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I keep saying really have you</v>

3871
02:54:50.741 --> 02:54:55.741
<v Speaker 1>tried turning it on and off again?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we kind of do need to kind of do a </v>

3872
02:54:55.741 --> 02:54:56.500
<v Speaker 1>full reset,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we need to start.</v>

3873
02:54:56.530 --> 02:55:01.530
<v Speaker 1>We have the technology to get to do all </v>
<v Speaker 1>these things and keep living standards </v>

3874
02:55:01.530 --> 02:55:01.930
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have the technology,</v>

3875
02:55:01.931 --> 02:55:04.100
<v Speaker 1>we just need to start acting on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether</v>

3876
02:55:04.100 --> 02:55:06.320
<v Speaker 2>it be hyperloop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hyperloop is a great idea.</v>

3877
02:55:06.321 --> 02:55:07.600
<v Speaker 2>Why aren't we doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3878
02:55:08.720 --> 02:55:10.550
<v Speaker 2>and the big thing that always comes to </v>
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>

3879
02:55:10.551 --> 02:55:12.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put solar panels on your roof.</v>

3880
02:55:12.700 --> 02:55:14.990
<v Speaker 2>Efficiency is a huge one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Change to led,</v>

3881
02:55:15.080 --> 02:55:16.730
<v Speaker 2>led bulbs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that sort of stuff.</v>

3882
02:55:16.790 --> 02:55:21.790
<v Speaker 2>There's a million different things and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we've gone over this a million times as </v>

3883
02:55:21.790 --> 02:55:21.790
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but always comes down to money.</v>

3884
02:55:21.790 --> 02:55:24.110
<v Speaker 2>And I always say there's lots of money </v>
<v Speaker 2>out there to be done.</v>

3885
02:55:24.200 --> 02:55:26.990
<v Speaker 2>There's lots of money to be used and </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you can raise taxes,</v>

3886
02:55:26.991 --> 02:55:28.340
<v Speaker 2>carbon taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a great way,</v>

3887
02:55:28.430 --> 02:55:29.960
<v Speaker 2>very efficient,</v>
<v Speaker 2>been proven over and over.</v>

3888
02:55:29.961 --> 02:55:32.150
<v Speaker 2>It's a great way to actually curb </v>
<v Speaker 2>climate change.</v>

3889
02:55:32.630 --> 02:55:35.480
<v Speaker 2>You could just print the money like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bankster that always works.</v>

3890
02:55:37.400 --> 02:55:39.290
<v Speaker 2>You could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get in a lot of trouble for</v>

3891
02:55:39.291 --> 02:55:44.291
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you could take a little bit of the </v>

3892
02:55:44.291 --> 02:55:47.441
<v Speaker 2>war budget,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that military budget and how you're </v>

3893
02:55:47.441 --> 02:55:47.441
<v Speaker 2>going to get in trouble for that.</v>

3894
02:55:47.441 --> 02:55:49.040
<v Speaker 2>That's really amazed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do climate change talks among moment.</v>

3895
02:55:49.041 --> 02:55:54.041
<v Speaker 2>I talk about reducing military budgets </v>
<v Speaker 2>and putting it towards good climate </v>

3896
02:55:54.041 --> 02:55:55.130
<v Speaker 2>change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That sort of freedom.</v>

3897
02:55:55.140 --> 02:55:57.260
<v Speaker 2>My posing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love team American.</v>

3898
02:55:57.261 --> 02:55:58.270
<v Speaker 2>That's a great man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3899
02:55:58.850 --> 02:56:02.060
<v Speaker 2>so I mean I actually did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started a nonprofit,</v>

3900
02:56:02.061 --> 02:56:04.490
<v Speaker 2>but it's more of an idea at the moment </v>
<v Speaker 2>called world without war.</v>

3901
02:56:04.520 --> 02:56:09.520
<v Speaker 2>And that was all about hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's take 50 percent of the military </v>

3902
02:56:09.520 --> 02:56:12.461
<v Speaker 2>budgets and put it towards large </v>
<v Speaker 2>infrastructure projects are planting </v>

3903
02:56:12.461 --> 02:56:12.890
<v Speaker 2>trees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>build a hyperloop.</v>

3904
02:56:12.950 --> 02:56:14.720
<v Speaker 2>And once you do the figures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like once you have,</v>

3905
02:56:14.750 --> 02:56:16.010
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got $2,000,000,000,000,</v>

3906
02:56:16.011 --> 02:56:18.620
<v Speaker 2>what can I do for $2,000,000,000,000?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd be amazed.</v>

3907
02:56:18.621 --> 02:56:20.120
<v Speaker 2>You can give free education for </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone.</v>

3908
02:56:20.121 --> 02:56:24.500
<v Speaker 2>You can convert all those coal fire </v>
<v Speaker 2>power plants into renewables.</v>

3909
02:56:24.501 --> 02:56:29.501
<v Speaker 2>You can completely reduce deforestation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can do zero website world without </v>

3910
02:56:29.501 --> 02:56:31.010
<v Speaker 2>or.org.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said it's just an idea.</v>

3911
02:56:31.070 --> 02:56:32.550
<v Speaker 2>Just started.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3912
02:56:32.660 --> 02:56:37.660
<v Speaker 2>but that's the last one I'd like to end </v>
<v Speaker 2>on because I know we're running out of </v>

3913
02:56:37.660 --> 02:56:39.560
<v Speaker 2>time is buckminster fuller and I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>he put it best,</v>

3914
02:56:39.590 --> 02:56:42.920
<v Speaker 2>which is it is now highly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>highly feasible to take care of everyone</v>

3915
02:56:42.921 --> 02:56:46.070
<v Speaker 2>on earth at a higher standard of living </v>
<v Speaker 2>than any have ever known.</v>

3916
02:56:46.220 --> 02:56:49.670
<v Speaker 2>It no longer has to be you and me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Selfishness is unnecessary.</v>

3917
02:56:49.940 --> 02:56:54.940
<v Speaker 2>War is obsolete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a matter of converting the high </v>

3918
02:56:54.940 --> 02:56:54.950
<v Speaker 2>technology from weaponry to luminary.</v>

3919
02:56:56.930 --> 02:56:59.090
<v Speaker 1>That's a beautiful quote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But how do you,</v>

3920
02:56:59.270 --> 02:57:01.970
<v Speaker 1>how do you deal with Isis?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you deal with Isis?</v>

3921
02:57:03.050 --> 02:57:04.070
<v Speaker 1>Once again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll get in trouble.</v>

3922
02:57:04.250 --> 02:57:04.700
<v Speaker 1>Don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

3923
02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:07.930
<v Speaker 1>don't build isis in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't give them over weapons.</v>

3924
02:57:08.470 --> 02:57:09.550
<v Speaker 1>But once you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3925
02:57:09.590 --> 02:57:12.080
<v Speaker 1>once you do have them with all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>weapons,</v>

3926
02:57:12.081 --> 02:57:17.081
<v Speaker 1>what is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People getting shot by toddlers on a </v>

3927
02:57:17.081 --> 02:57:17.081
<v Speaker 1>weekly basis this year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's real.</v>

3928
02:57:17.420 --> 02:57:21.860
<v Speaker 1>Oh my fucking God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More Americans who are two year olds are</v>

3929
02:57:21.861 --> 02:57:23.420
<v Speaker 1>shooting people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3930
02:57:23.540 --> 02:57:25.270
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or in October,</v>

3931
02:57:25.280 --> 02:57:27.660
<v Speaker 1>2015,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it said 43 instances.</v>

3932
02:57:27.860 --> 02:57:28.770
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3933
02:57:29.180 --> 02:57:30.470
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is insane.</v>

3934
02:57:30.620 --> 02:57:34.250
<v Speaker 1>In 2015,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least 13 toddlers have been,</v>

3935
02:57:34.390 --> 02:57:37.070
<v Speaker 1>have inadvertently killed themselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>with firearms.</v>

3936
02:57:37.071 --> 02:57:42.071
<v Speaker 1>18 more injured themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 injured other people and two killed </v>

3937
02:57:42.071 --> 02:57:45.190
<v Speaker 1>other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm still at children.</v>

3938
02:57:45.950 --> 02:57:46.610
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're just,</v>

3939
02:57:46.640 --> 02:57:51.640
<v Speaker 1>it's not the kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's people that leave the fucking guns </v>

3940
02:57:51.640 --> 02:57:52.900
<v Speaker 1>around kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it says.</v>

3941
02:57:52.910 --> 02:57:54.140
<v Speaker 1>You didn't Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have no guns.</v>

3942
02:57:54.260 --> 02:57:58.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had the largest massacre on earth.</v>

3943
02:57:58.180 --> 02:58:01.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm 36 people or something got killed </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we just tend to run.</v>

3944
02:58:01.080 --> 02:58:01.590
<v Speaker 1>Went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eh.</v>

3945
02:58:01.591 --> 02:58:01.950
<v Speaker 1>You know what</v>

3946
02:58:02.010 --> 02:58:05.940
<v Speaker 3>we don't against worked rather well we </v>
<v Speaker 3>did for you guys.</v>

3947
02:58:05.941 --> 02:58:10.941
<v Speaker 3>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have the population of Los Angeles </v>

3948
02:58:10.941 --> 02:58:11.760
<v Speaker 3>and in China and Hong Kong land.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3949
02:58:11.770 --> 02:58:14.760
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something like a certain.</v>

3950
02:58:15.600 --> 02:58:18.600
<v Speaker 3>I think there's hundreds of millions of </v>
<v Speaker 3>guns in America.</v>

3951
02:58:18.601 --> 02:58:23.601
<v Speaker 3>I think there's as many guns as there </v>
<v Speaker 3>are people and there are trillions of </v>

3952
02:58:23.601 --> 02:58:28.251
<v Speaker 3>rounds of ammunition and the gun people </v>
<v Speaker 3>say if there was really a gun problem,</v>

3953
02:58:28.590 --> 02:58:33.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would all our guns and all our ammo </v>

3954
02:58:33.590 --> 02:58:37.890
<v Speaker 3>through is really a gun problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fucking just reasonably suggested,</v>

3955
02:58:37.950 --> 02:58:42.950
<v Speaker 3>reasonably suggested that people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are mentally unbalanced maybe shouldn't </v>

3956
02:58:42.950 --> 02:58:47.571
<v Speaker 3>have guns and people and the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>hate from the far right,</v>

3957
02:58:49.270 --> 02:58:54.270
<v Speaker 3>but like the people that really believe </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the second amendment says though,</v>

3958
02:58:54.971 --> 02:58:59.430
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a right to keep and bear not but no</v>

3959
02:58:59.431 --> 02:59:01.770
<v Speaker 3>buts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe in the second amendment,</v>

3960
02:59:01.860 --> 02:59:02.960
<v Speaker 3>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3961
02:59:02.970 --> 02:59:03.930
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no buts,</v>

3962
02:59:04.140 --> 02:59:05.730
<v Speaker 3>no buts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guns.</v>

3963
02:59:05.760 --> 02:59:08.370
<v Speaker 3>Isn't it like a well armed militias and </v>
<v Speaker 3>stop government?</v>

3964
02:59:08.670 --> 02:59:09.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what's supposed to be.</v>

3965
02:59:09.840 --> 02:59:10.620
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what they think.</v>

3966
02:59:10.621 --> 02:59:15.621
<v Speaker 3>Like those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Oregon people who we never figured </v>

3967
02:59:15.621 --> 02:59:17.940
<v Speaker 3>out who first dubbed them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Y'All kinda whoever that guy is,</v>

3968
02:59:18.030 --> 02:59:22.710
<v Speaker 3>Kudos to you or her ma'am or sir,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's great.</v>

3969
02:59:22.800 --> 02:59:24.060
<v Speaker 3>Great Name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

3970
02:59:24.210 --> 02:59:25.020
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those people,</v>

3971
02:59:25.021 --> 02:59:26.930
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of people like that that </v>
<v Speaker 3>think will,</v>

3972
02:59:26.940 --> 02:59:28.680
<v Speaker 3>they're coming for our guns.</v>

3973
02:59:30.900 --> 02:59:32.190
<v Speaker 3>It's education.</v>

3974
02:59:32.330 --> 02:59:33.830
<v Speaker 2>When it comes down to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best thing,</v>

3975
02:59:33.860 --> 02:59:36.860
<v Speaker 2>money for dollar for dollar that you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>do is education.</v>

3976
02:59:37.460 --> 02:59:42.460
<v Speaker 2>If you educate women in the world that </v>
<v Speaker 2>have less children and that that solves </v>

3977
02:59:42.460 --> 02:59:42.460
<v Speaker 2>a lot of problems right there to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>truth.</v>

3978
02:59:42.690 --> 02:59:47.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm the only other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dollar for dollar education is the best </v>

3979
02:59:47.690 --> 02:59:50.930
<v Speaker 2>way and especially educating women and </v>
<v Speaker 2>in third world countries especially,</v>

3980
02:59:50.960 --> 02:59:55.960
<v Speaker 2>but that was the way 20 years ago I feel</v>
<v Speaker 2>now we've gotten to the point where we </v>

3981
02:59:56.151 --> 02:59:57.700
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said 40 year lag,</v>

3982
02:59:57.770 --> 03:00:00.800
<v Speaker 2>so what's happening now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not going to see for 40 years.</v>

3983
03:00:01.130 --> 03:00:06.130
<v Speaker 2>We need to do something major.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need to do something right now and </v>

3984
03:00:06.130 --> 03:00:08.921
<v Speaker 2>that's why I quite like the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>without war thing because for every </v>

3985
03:00:08.921 --> 03:00:10.340
<v Speaker 2>dollar you spend lobbying to get people </v>
<v Speaker 2>to reduce their military budget,</v>

3986
03:00:10.580 --> 03:00:15.580
<v Speaker 2>you multiply,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get a lot more money </v>

3987
03:00:15.580 --> 03:00:15.580
<v Speaker 2>diverted to something that</v>

3988
03:00:15.580 --> 03:00:18.470
<v Speaker 3>is better for society basically.</v>

3989
03:00:18.630 --> 03:00:23.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's whether it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>infrastructure or hyperloop or plant </v>

3990
03:00:23.630 --> 03:00:23.630
<v Speaker 2>trees or get electric cars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

3991
03:00:23.630 --> 03:00:24.150
<v Speaker 2>throw the money at it.</v>

3992
03:00:24.390 --> 03:00:29.390
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very few people would argue with you </v>

3993
03:00:29.390 --> 03:00:29.390
<v Speaker 3>that the world would be better off </v>
<v Speaker 3>without war.</v>

3994
03:00:29.390 --> 03:00:31.350
<v Speaker 3>I think the real argument,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone argues with me on that one,</v>

3995
03:00:31.530 --> 03:00:36.530
<v Speaker 3>I think the real argument would be </v>
<v Speaker 3>whether or not the rest of the world </v>

3996
03:00:36.530 --> 03:00:36.810
<v Speaker 3>would cooperate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we all would agree.</v>

3997
03:00:36.960 --> 03:00:41.370
<v Speaker 3>Let's just like ramp down our gun </v>
<v Speaker 3>production or missile production.</v>

3998
03:00:41.550 --> 03:00:45.960
<v Speaker 3>Let's ramp it down and everybody relaxed</v>
<v Speaker 3>and let's reallocate those resources.</v>

3999
03:00:46.230 --> 03:00:48.060
<v Speaker 3>Most people would say that'd be a great </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea,</v>

4000
03:00:48.061 --> 03:00:51.300
<v Speaker 3>but who's going to do it as well?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

4001
03:00:51.380 --> 03:00:53.540
<v Speaker 3>Is Isis going to do it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like these example</v>

4002
03:00:53.580 --> 03:00:58.580
<v Speaker 2>of Indian Pakistan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>India and Pakistan keep raising the </v>

4003
03:00:58.580 --> 03:01:01.221
<v Speaker 2>military budgets every year to compete </v>
<v Speaker 2>with each other because they want to </v>

4004
03:01:01.221 --> 03:01:01.221
<v Speaker 2>make sure that we're spending</v>

4005
03:01:01.221 --> 03:01:01.570
<v Speaker 1>the same amount as the other guy because</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy,</v>

4006
03:01:01.571 --> 03:01:06.571
<v Speaker 1>the other guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go to these two countries and you </v>

4007
03:01:06.571 --> 03:01:06.571
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

4008
03:01:06.571 --> 03:01:07.000
<v Speaker 1>here's a treaty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like all the trade agreements,</v>

4009
03:01:07.001 --> 03:01:12.001
<v Speaker 1>whatever that you sign and you reduce </v>
<v Speaker 1>the military budget by 50 percent and </v>

4010
03:01:12.001 --> 03:01:15.541
<v Speaker 1>the other guy promises to do it as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly you're reducing war which are </v>

4011
03:01:15.541 --> 03:01:19.991
<v Speaker 1>more for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're also helping a relieving a </v>

4012
03:01:19.991 --> 03:01:20.140
<v Speaker 1>heap of money available for Climate </v>
<v Speaker 1>Change Abatement.</v>

4013
03:01:20.590 --> 03:01:24.610
<v Speaker 1>So I think it's a win win situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all my Lord I get in trouble.</v>

4014
03:01:24.611 --> 03:01:26.990
<v Speaker 1>We're not talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you signed your hippie.</v>

4015
03:01:27.450 --> 03:01:29.740
<v Speaker 1>Got Idealistic Hippie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what the problem is.</v>

4016
03:01:29.770 --> 03:01:30.920
<v Speaker 1>The people right now are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4017
03:01:31.060 --> 03:01:33.730
<v Speaker 1>fuck this hippie shutting their iphone </v>
<v Speaker 1>off right now.</v>

4018
03:01:33.790 --> 03:01:36.560
<v Speaker 1>Fucking hippie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate when Rogan as hippies on.</v>

4019
03:01:37.530 --> 03:01:40.060
<v Speaker 1>But who wants war man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody wants war.</v>

4020
03:01:40.150 --> 03:01:41.410
<v Speaker 1>So maybe Jocko.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jocko.</v>

4021
03:01:41.411 --> 03:01:43.870
<v Speaker 1>My aunt is it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people don't want it,</v>

4022
03:01:44.140 --> 03:01:45.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they date,</v>

4023
03:01:45.500 --> 03:01:48.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they reluctantly accept the fact that we</v>

4024
03:01:48.401 --> 03:01:53.401
<v Speaker 1>have disputes and then we have a armies </v>
<v Speaker 1>to handle that and keep us safe.</v>

4025
03:01:54.690 --> 03:01:59.690
<v Speaker 1>But if you ask them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would it be better if we just took that </v>

4026
03:01:59.690 --> 03:02:03.181
<v Speaker 1>money?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And instead of like having all this </v>

4027
03:02:03.181 --> 03:02:03.181
<v Speaker 1>military spending on climate change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4028
03:02:03.181 --> 03:02:05.320
<v Speaker 1>But then there's also those people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are in the military that don't have jobs</v>

4029
03:02:05.321 --> 03:02:07.510
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you know how many soldiers,</v>

4030
03:02:07.511 --> 03:02:12.511
<v Speaker 1>like we have less soldiers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure we can get jobs for them that </v>

4031
03:02:12.511 --> 03:02:13.450
<v Speaker 1>don't involve killing people with as </v>
<v Speaker 1>many different ways to do this.</v>

4032
03:02:13.990 --> 03:02:16.120
<v Speaker 1>You can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is all very reasonable.</v>

4033
03:02:16.150 --> 03:02:17.250
<v Speaker 1>I just don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4034
03:02:17.280 --> 03:02:18.250
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

4035
03:02:18.270 --> 03:02:21.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm amazed at how much kickback I get </v>
<v Speaker 1>from that one thing,</v>

4036
03:02:21.450 --> 03:02:23.410
<v Speaker 1>but I normally don't mention it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean to make climate change.</v>

4037
03:02:23.411 --> 03:02:25.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to convolute it with </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

4038
03:02:25.900 --> 03:02:30.900
<v Speaker 1>It's such a perfect idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A perfect idea is in that console a lot </v>

4039
03:02:31.421 --> 03:02:36.421
<v Speaker 1>of problems and at the timeframe that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>need to solve them because everything </v>

4040
03:02:36.421 --> 03:02:36.421
<v Speaker 1>else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the climate,</v>

4041
03:02:36.460 --> 03:02:37.390
<v Speaker 1>Paris talks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4042
03:02:37.540 --> 03:02:42.540
<v Speaker 1>Cop Twenty one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the first time they got together </v>

4043
03:02:42.540 --> 03:02:42.540
<v Speaker 1>talking about climate science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they eventually went,</v>

4044
03:02:42.540 --> 03:02:43.000
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>195 countries.</v>

4045
03:02:43.001 --> 03:02:46.960
<v Speaker 1>We agree something's gone wrong and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to prevent the earth and warming to</v>

4046
03:02:46.990 --> 03:02:49.630
<v Speaker 1>two degrees Celsius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4047
03:02:50.440 --> 03:02:52.630
<v Speaker 1>six months later we're already there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4048
03:02:52.660 --> 03:02:53.860
<v Speaker 1>so and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>

4049
03:02:53.870 --> 03:02:56.140
<v Speaker 1>they're not agreeing to do anything for </v>
<v Speaker 1>five years as well,</v>

4050
03:02:56.260 --> 03:02:57.880
<v Speaker 1>so they don't even start to do anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>five years.</v>

4051
03:02:57.881 --> 03:03:00.580
<v Speaker 1>Like if we wait for politicians to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>something about this,</v>

4052
03:03:00.620 --> 03:03:02.490
<v Speaker 1>we're so screwed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We really are.</v>

4053
03:03:02.680 --> 03:03:07.680
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the problems with having </v>

4054
03:03:07.680 --> 03:03:08.920
<v Speaker 1>politicians is that they're not experts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not experts in anything.</v>

4055
03:03:08.950 --> 03:03:11.710
<v Speaker 1>They're experts in figuring out how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get people to vote for him.</v>

4056
03:03:11.770 --> 03:03:13.720
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most politicians,</v>

4057
03:03:13.780 --> 03:03:18.780
<v Speaker 1>they're not the best at anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're certainly not like exemplary </v>

4058
03:03:19.301 --> 03:03:22.990
<v Speaker 1>human beings who are beyond reproach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The good egg,</v>

4059
03:03:23.330 --> 03:03:24.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're good at debate,</v>

4060
03:03:24.441 --> 03:03:29.441
<v Speaker 1>so like other than Bernie Sanders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean Bernie Sanders seems to be a </v>

4061
03:03:29.441 --> 03:03:31.690
<v Speaker 1>pretty exemplary guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Believe or not believe in socialism.</v>

4062
03:03:31.691 --> 03:03:36.691
<v Speaker 1>Argue it as you may.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He seems like a great guy with some </v>

4063
03:03:36.691 --> 03:03:38.500
<v Speaker 1>pretty good ideas about the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're at a time,</v>

4064
03:03:38.920 --> 03:03:39.760
<v Speaker 1>one at a time.</v>
