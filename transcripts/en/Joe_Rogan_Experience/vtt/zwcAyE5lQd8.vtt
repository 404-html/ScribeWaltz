20

<v Speaker 1>it's interesting to talk to you and to</v>

22
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.830
<v Speaker 1>Probably have some interesting insight I</v>
<v Speaker 1>would imagine.</v>

23
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.421
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess so.</v>

24
00:01:18.421 --> 00:01:19.560
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a slow,</v>

25
00:01:19.561 --> 00:01:23.430
<v Speaker 1>one was a slow burn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>took a long time and a lot of different</v>

26
00:01:23.431 --> 00:01:25.170
<v Speaker 1>shows till it started getting really</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird.</v>

27
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.740
<v Speaker 1>It was pretty manageable news radio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was that.</v>

28
00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.460
<v Speaker 1>How long were you out here before that</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened?</v>

29
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.530
<v Speaker 1>I came out here for a show right before</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I was on another show called</v>

30
00:01:34.531 --> 00:01:36.330
<v Speaker 1>hardball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's this baseball show,</v>

31
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.490
<v Speaker 1>so that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

32
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.420
<v Speaker 1>maybe like six months before news radio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it wasn't very long.</v>

33
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.780
<v Speaker 1>I came out here specifically for that</v>
<v Speaker 1>hardball show.</v>

34
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.680
<v Speaker 1>One of the things just sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunities turned into other things,</v>

35
00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ebbs and flows and comes and goes.</v>

36
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.530
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the news radio fame was nonexistent.</v>

37
00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.460
<v Speaker 1>Like nobody ever recognized me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone.</v>

38
00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.510
<v Speaker 1>But you're getting recognized now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Too much man in specific towns where</v>

39
00:02:02.611 --> 00:02:03.600
<v Speaker 1>we do better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

40
00:02:03.601 --> 00:02:06.450
<v Speaker 1>But it's mostly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

41
00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.550
<v Speaker 1>99 percent of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People were really cool.</v>

42
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:10.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that the fact?</v>

43
00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really what's up.</v>

44
00:02:12.211 --> 00:02:14.600
<v Speaker 1>Ninety nine percent of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People really good.</v>

45
00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:19.080
<v Speaker 1>Even the one percent are still cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just lasts a little too long.</v>

46
00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the outliers.</v>

47
00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.860
<v Speaker 1>Know the extreme cases that aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

48
00:02:25.861 --> 00:02:30.861
<v Speaker 1>the one percent of the one percent that</v>
<v Speaker 1>could be a sign in that in the grand</v>

49
00:02:32.161 --> 00:02:34.530
<v Speaker 1>scheme of things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel like I've really blown up</v>

50
00:02:34.531 --> 00:02:35.880
<v Speaker 1>that big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

51
00:02:35.881 --> 00:02:38.220
<v Speaker 1>Like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I've clawed my way to the</v>

52
00:02:38.221 --> 00:02:40.740
<v Speaker 1>beginning as it were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good way to look at it.</v>

53
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.930
<v Speaker 1>But it's some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

54
00:02:42.931 --> 00:02:43.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the beginning?</v>

55
00:02:43.951 --> 00:02:45.120
<v Speaker 1>What's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the,</v>

56
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.270
<v Speaker 1>what's the top?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

57
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't know exactly what I do know is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's a lot of people that like</v>

58
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.330
<v Speaker 1>will text me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

59
00:02:51.331 --> 00:02:54.770
<v Speaker 1>have you heard a surgical simpson?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit now</v>

60
00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.400
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's A.</v>

61
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.400
<v Speaker 1>Although</v>

62
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.170
<v Speaker 2>I guess transitionally has been in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>last couple of years,</v>

63
00:03:05.171 --> 00:03:07.210
<v Speaker 2>three years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've been doing this my whole life,</v>

64
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.530
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to various levels of thanklessness.</v>

65
00:03:11.531 --> 00:03:13.630
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of years in Honky tonks and just</v>

66
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.730
<v Speaker 2>dive bars where you were background</v>
<v Speaker 2>noise.</v>

67
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.980
<v Speaker 2>So I am,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now that I'm older,</v>

68
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.590
<v Speaker 2>I think that's been the best part of it</v>
<v Speaker 2>is I'm,</v>

69
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm clear and focused enough and have</v>
<v Speaker 2>enough responsibilities in my life to</v>

70
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.480
<v Speaker 2>where I'm not taking it for granted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does it make sense 100 percent trying to</v>

71
00:03:28.481 --> 00:03:33.481
<v Speaker 2>like really use it as the opportunity</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is to do something hopefully bigger</v>

72
00:03:35.711 --> 00:03:38.620
<v Speaker 2>than just myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

73
00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.120
<v Speaker 1>Well being a famous singer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

74
00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.070
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you affect people and a singer and a</v>

75
00:03:44.071 --> 00:03:46.890
<v Speaker 1>songwriter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you affect people in a very strange way.</v>

76
00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.880
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

77
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.540
<v Speaker 1>there's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an intense emotion that's um,</v>

78
00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.950
<v Speaker 1>that's connected to a song that really</v>
<v Speaker 1>moves you,</v>

79
00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this intense connection.</v>

80
00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.000
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

81
00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:01.740
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think for someone like you,</v>

82
00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.890
<v Speaker 1>like it's great that you've got all this</v>
<v Speaker 1>life experience.</v>

83
00:04:04.891 --> 00:04:06.330
<v Speaker 1>I think that helps so much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

84
00:04:06.331 --> 00:04:08.640
<v Speaker 1>I think if you're a fucking Justin</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bieber type character,</v>

85
00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.250
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're almost guaranteed to be fucked.</v>

86
00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.620

<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

<v Speaker 1>but I couldn't tell you a single song,</v>

89
00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.280
<v Speaker 1>but yet I know who he is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is that?</v>

90
00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.560
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's famous as famous as fuck,</v>

91
00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.230

94
00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.290

<v Speaker 1>It's easy to judge and sit back and be</v>

95
00:04:34.291 --> 00:04:34.621
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

100
00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.810

<v Speaker 1>person would be with that kind of insane</v>

101
00:04:57.301 --> 00:04:59.180
<v Speaker 1>breach like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just what,</v>

102
00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.480
<v Speaker 1>what it must be like for him to just try</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go through a group of girls.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

108
00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:23.730
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be so hard to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to keep your shit together and to have a</v>

109
00:05:23.731 --> 00:05:26.940
<v Speaker 1>balanced perspective because there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>only perspective is one of fame.</v>

110
00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.180
<v Speaker 1>So you talking about the Honky tonks and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

111
00:05:30.181 --> 00:05:33.290

<v Speaker 1>Go from that,</v>

115
00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:42.540
<v Speaker 1>that kind of shit to where you are now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have an earned perspective,</v>

116
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.230
<v Speaker 1>an earned perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas it's still hard to feel like it.</v>

117
00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:47.123
<v Speaker 1>When you say earned.</v>

<v Speaker 1>as long as it took to get here and even</v>

124
00:06:03.291 --> 00:06:06.910
<v Speaker 1>the last three years we toured our asses</v>
<v Speaker 1>off me like going in circles to kind of</v>

128
00:06:13.391 --> 00:06:15.860
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I can feel like I accomplished</v>

129
00:06:15.861 --> 00:06:18.590
<v Speaker 1>something with merit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it</v>

130
00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:22.760
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it beautiful time.</v>

131
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.790
<v Speaker 1>It's a beautiful time for artists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

132
00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:28.160
<v Speaker 1>So we're definitely in a moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

133
00:06:28.161 --> 00:06:29.360
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>

134
00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.330
<v Speaker 1>It seems like a moment with music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a moment with.</v>

135
00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:34.310
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely a moment with stand up</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy.</v>

136
00:06:34.311 --> 00:06:37.070
<v Speaker 1>We all talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the best time ever for standup</v>

137
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:39.980
<v Speaker 1>I think contribute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still getting over.</v>

138
00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:44.570
<v Speaker 1>Brian Holtzman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was the guy that did the last set</v>

139
00:06:44.571 --> 00:06:46.770
<v Speaker 1>that do that fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was traumatized.</v>

140
00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.600
<v Speaker 1>I was an experienced man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't even tell you because you got</v>

141
00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:54.680
<v Speaker 1>motherfuckers didn't tell me what was</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming to sit.</v>

142
00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:58.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm sitting here thinking like I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching this guy bomb harder than</v>

143
00:06:58.041 --> 00:07:00.740
<v Speaker 1>anything I've ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like telling people in the audience to</v>

144
00:07:00.741 --> 00:07:04.790
<v Speaker 1>just start fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's like truck couldn't take my</v>

145
00:07:04.791 --> 00:07:06.180
<v Speaker 1>eyes off of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

146
00:07:06.181 --> 00:07:07.660
<v Speaker 1>It was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then after the study is like,</v>

147
00:07:07.661 --> 00:07:08.420
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

148
00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:09.860
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

149
00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:12.860
<v Speaker 1>That was all just geodis yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's genius.</v>

150
00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:18.010
<v Speaker 1>Brian holzman's genius 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he keeps running out of the room</v>

151
00:07:18.081 --> 00:07:21.280
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like literally this takes two were</v>

152
00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:24.110
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ran out of the room to get away from</v>

153
00:07:24.111 --> 00:07:29.111
<v Speaker 1>this thing happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The vial expression of toxic masculinity</v>

154
00:07:29.361 --> 00:07:30.830
<v Speaker 1>on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

155
00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:34.640
<v Speaker 1>Brian does the kinison spot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the last spot of the night.</v>

156
00:07:34.641 --> 00:07:37.400
<v Speaker 1>So the last guy on the comedy store,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most pops the comments?</v>

157
00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:39.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Last Pot at the comedy store.</v>

158
00:07:39.891 --> 00:07:43.190
<v Speaker 1>It just goes on from like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess he gets on probably somewhere</v>

159
00:07:43.191 --> 00:07:45.860
<v Speaker 1>around 1230,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe one inch and then he'll,</v>

160
00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:49.220
<v Speaker 1>he might go til to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's got a long stretch.</v>

161
00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:51.870
<v Speaker 1>He does whatever he wants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's the innocence.</v>

162
00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:55.610
<v Speaker 1>How long has he been in this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But while he's the perfect guy for that</v>

163
00:07:55.611 --> 00:08:00.110
<v Speaker 1>spot and he does it on and off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's been there at the store as long as</v>

164
00:08:00.111 --> 00:08:00.740
<v Speaker 1>I have.</v>

165
00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:02.570
<v Speaker 1>He's been there at the store since</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] 94.</v>

166
00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:03.920
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I met him in [inaudible] 94.</v>

167
00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:05.660
<v Speaker 1>Was it always in that room?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now?</v>

168
00:08:05.661 --> 00:08:08.450
<v Speaker 1>He does the little room to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where I first met him or first</v>

169
00:08:08.451 --> 00:08:10.940
<v Speaker 1>met him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like this promising up and coming</v>

170
00:08:10.941 --> 00:08:15.200
<v Speaker 1>guy that would go on in the smaller room</v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

171
00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:16.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was like one of the hot up and coming</v>

172
00:08:16.821 --> 00:08:18.500
<v Speaker 1>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he always kept like a real job.</v>

173
00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:20.360
<v Speaker 1>But he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>

174
00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:22.100
<v Speaker 1>he's one of the best comics in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

175
00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:25.490
<v Speaker 1>He just doesn't get a chance to show it</v>
<v Speaker 1>to people.</v>

176
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:29.120
<v Speaker 1>We've tried to talk about like what</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be the best way to let people know</v>

177
00:08:29.121 --> 00:08:31.550
<v Speaker 1>and I think because he changes his stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much.</v>

178
00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:37.480
<v Speaker 1>I think just putting cameras on him</v>
<v Speaker 1>every night filming these Kennison spots</v>

179
00:08:37.851 --> 00:08:39.470
<v Speaker 1>that he does every Friday and Saturday</v>
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>

180
00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:43.650
<v Speaker 1>I tell everybody if you want to see some</v>
<v Speaker 1>comments to tough one because to,</v>

181
00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:45.230
<v Speaker 1>to make people aware,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

182
00:08:45.231 --> 00:08:48.890
<v Speaker 1>to let them know you kind of have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost in a way sort of have to give</v>

183
00:08:48.891 --> 00:08:52.190
<v Speaker 1>away what makes it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it.</v>

184
00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:54.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't bother me.</v>

185
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:57.930
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know and I think it's fucking genius.</v>

186
00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:00.710
<v Speaker 1>I know he's a great guy and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean we're,</v>

187
00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:01.950
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're kind of beating around the Bush</v>

188
00:09:01.951 --> 00:09:05.010
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says obviously ridiculously offensive</v>

189
00:09:05.011 --> 00:09:06.720
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he doesn't really mean</v>

190
00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:11.160
<v Speaker 1>I fucking have always loved that style</v>
<v Speaker 1>of comedy,</v>

191
00:09:11.161 --> 00:09:13.260
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's in my opinion and like one of</v>

192
00:09:13.261 --> 00:09:15.180
<v Speaker 1>the best ever at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a monster.</v>

193
00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:18.600
<v Speaker 1>Just people don't know for whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't know because he never</v>

194
00:09:18.601 --> 00:09:21.960
<v Speaker 1>left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He stayed at the store and that's a spot</v>

195
00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.780
<v Speaker 1>he stayed in la and he always kept a</v>
<v Speaker 1>job.</v>

196
00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:25.830
<v Speaker 1>He always had a job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a meter,</v>

197
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.680
<v Speaker 1>a meter maid at one point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Had a bunch of jobs like that kind of</v>

198
00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:32.170
<v Speaker 1>will be Koski type guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

199
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.840
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

201
00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.270
<v Speaker 1>Like someone's got to come along and do</v>
<v Speaker 1>it all for them better.</v>

202
00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:39.211
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

211
00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:59.010

212
00:09:59.011 --> 00:10:03.480
<v Speaker 1>people don't realize how goofy it sounds</v>
<v Speaker 1>when everybody talks over everybody.</v>

213
00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:06.990
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you a three people and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have the ear things while you were</v>

214

<v Speaker 1>talking about before you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

215
00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:13.890
<v Speaker 1>So the fight podcasts we do for people</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we made it mandatory like got to</v>

216
00:10:13.891 --> 00:10:17.730
<v Speaker 1>wear earphones because we were drunk and</v>
<v Speaker 1>stoned and we're talking over each</v>

217
00:10:17.731 --> 00:10:19.380
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People with chewing into the mic,</v>

218
00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:20.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how bad it sounds,</v>

219
00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:25.320
<v Speaker 1>people eating pickles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>potato chips and pickles into the</v>

220
00:10:25.321 --> 00:10:28.080
<v Speaker 1>fucking microphone and it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

221
00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:30.960
<v Speaker 1>I would get these screaming texts from</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

222
00:10:30.961 --> 00:10:33.480
<v Speaker 1>stopped chewing into the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>microphones.</v>

223
00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:38.280
<v Speaker 1>So we had to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had to institute the headphones</v>

224
00:10:38.281 --> 00:10:41.630
<v Speaker 1>policy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for a gentle conversational,</v>

225
00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:44.970
<v Speaker 1>it's like yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very easy to put those aside.</v>

226
00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:49.020
<v Speaker 1>Are you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

227
00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:52.860

<v Speaker 1>those three years when you were going</v>

228
00:10:52.861 --> 00:10:55.230
<v Speaker 1>crazy and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and torn like a maniac,</v>

229
00:10:55.590 --> 00:11:00.360
<v Speaker 1>have you settled that down to more</v>
<v Speaker 1>manageable sort of a schedule?</v>

230
00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:01.323
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

231
00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:06.720
<v Speaker 2>it would have been fine otherwise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've always lived out of a bag</v>

232
00:11:07.901 --> 00:11:08.681
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

233
00:11:08.681 --> 00:11:10.630
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and wanted to be moving all the time.</v>

234
00:11:10.631 --> 00:11:12.970
<v Speaker 2>So like in that regard is kind of ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it just,</v>

235
00:11:12.971 --> 00:11:15.260
<v Speaker 2>the timing was a little bittersweet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

236
00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:20.370
<v Speaker 2>My son was born about a month after the</v>
<v Speaker 2>last record came out of a,</v>

237
00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:23.800
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was home for that.</v>

238
00:11:23.801 --> 00:11:26.580
<v Speaker 2>And then basically three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three or four days after he was born,</v>

239
00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:31.590
<v Speaker 2>I had to go to Europe for some shows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then press started rolling in a word</v>

240
00:11:32.471 --> 00:11:34.720
<v Speaker 2>of mouth and record,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just started selling to,</v>

241
00:11:34.721 --> 00:11:39.721
<v Speaker 2>it's like a movie and my weight and my</v>
<v Speaker 2>wife has a very supportive in our that I</v>

242
00:11:41.141 --> 00:11:45.340
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't have moved to national first</v>
<v Speaker 2>place to do anything without her,</v>

243
00:11:45.341 --> 00:11:46.960
<v Speaker 2>like telling me you can do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

244
00:11:46.961 --> 00:11:48.460
<v Speaker 2>I'd probably still be working for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>railroad.</v>

245
00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:49.740
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

246
00:11:49.741 --> 00:11:51.430
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it all kind of came about,</v>

247
00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:53.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just basically said,</v>

248
00:11:53.461 --> 00:11:53.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we didn't,</v>

249
00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:56.830
<v Speaker 2>we didn't come here and like you do</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything up until this point to not be</v>

250
00:11:56.831 --> 00:12:00.370
<v Speaker 2>able to go and because you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now you have to tour,</v>

251
00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:01.630
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

252
00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:03.341
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

253
00:12:03.341 --> 00:12:05.080
<v Speaker 2>did in other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

254
00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:09.230
<v Speaker 2>I think missing out what was going on at</v>
<v Speaker 2>home and,</v>

255
00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:11.710
<v Speaker 2>and carrying some sense of guilt maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>for that,</v>

256
00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:13.960
<v Speaker 2>because even though like in my hair and</v>
<v Speaker 2>my dreams are coming true,</v>

257
00:12:13.961 --> 00:12:17.980
<v Speaker 2>it's providing for my family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when we come home after five or six</v>

258
00:12:17.981 --> 00:12:20.590
<v Speaker 2>weeks and then I've got a week at home</v>
<v Speaker 2>before leaving again,</v>

259
00:12:20.591 --> 00:12:22.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm just kind of see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was seeing what I was missing and</v>

260
00:12:22.871 --> 00:12:24.040
<v Speaker 2>incremental stages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

261
00:12:24.041 --> 00:12:29.041
<v Speaker 2>and I think it took a toll on me</v>
<v Speaker 2>emotionally in a way that I wouldn't</v>

262
00:12:29.471 --> 00:12:31.540
<v Speaker 2>have anticipated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's kind of where this record came</v>

263
00:12:31.541 --> 00:12:32.374
<v Speaker 2>from.</v>

264
00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:37.280
<v Speaker 3>I don't go on that kind of tour,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when I go away just for a few days,</v>

265
00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:39.230
<v Speaker 3>just for four or five days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

266
00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:44.240
<v Speaker 3>it bums me out when you come back home,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this rush of love,</v>

267
00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a good way to put it.</v>

268
00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:50.570
<v Speaker 3>It's what it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like this new when I come home,</v>

269
00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:54.230
<v Speaker 3>like I just got back from the road.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in Boston this weekend.</v>

270
00:12:54.231 --> 00:12:58.790
<v Speaker 3>I come home on Sunday and when your kids</v>
<v Speaker 3>run up to you and jump into your arms</v>

271
00:12:58.791 --> 00:13:00.620
<v Speaker 3>and you're carrying them and talking to</v>
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>

272
00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:01.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

273
00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:06.910
<v Speaker 3>it's very hard to describe for anybody</v>
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't have any children or</v>

274
00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:08.750
<v Speaker 3>doesn't have close friends with</v>
<v Speaker 3>children.</v>

275
00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.500
<v Speaker 3>It's very hard to describe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a fucking game changer.</v>

276
00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:16.550
<v Speaker 3>Game Changer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It changes who you are instantly.</v>

277
00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:18.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just different thing.</v>

278
00:13:18.471 --> 00:13:23.471
<v Speaker 3>You're a different perspective on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>world is so different and I don't think</v>

279
00:13:23.601 --> 00:13:24.434
<v Speaker 3>it's mandatory.</v>

280
00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:27.160
<v Speaker 3>I think this is important to say because</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

281
00:13:27.161 --> 00:13:32.161
<v Speaker 3>I used to bum me the fuck out when</v>
<v Speaker 3>people who were fathers or mothers would</v>

282
00:13:33.171 --> 00:13:36.560
<v Speaker 3>treat you like you were doing something</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong because you didn't have kids.</v>

283
00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:40.580
<v Speaker 3>There was something wrong with you or</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would tell you that you don't even</v>

284
00:13:40.581 --> 00:13:43.840
<v Speaker 3>know about life until you have kids or</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you know.</v>

285
00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:45.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a perspective enhancer,</v>

286
00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:46.890
<v Speaker 3>but guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of Shit's a purpose.</v>

287
00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:48.980
<v Speaker 3>Perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Enhanced or like you don't have to do</v>

288
00:13:48.981 --> 00:13:50.840
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for me,</v>

289
00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:53.410
<v Speaker 3>because I just hate when people tell</v>
<v Speaker 3>people you know,</v>

290
00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:56.600
<v Speaker 3>that it's like this mandatory aspect of</v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

291
00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:59.990
<v Speaker 3>I think you could absolutely have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>fulfilled life and never procreate.</v>

292
00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:02.180
<v Speaker 3>People shouldn't be appearance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

293
00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:04.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

294
00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:06.710
<v Speaker 3>Almost every girl I ever dated stay out</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the business.</v>

295
00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:12.800
<v Speaker 3>That's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They changed to man.</v>

296
00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:17.210
<v Speaker 3>I have a buddy of mine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His ex girlfriend was crazy just off the</v>

297
00:14:17.211 --> 00:14:20.780
<v Speaker 3>charts crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just wild girls out of her mind,</v>

298
00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:24.290
<v Speaker 3>drugs and sex and chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She had a kid.</v>

299
00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:26.150
<v Speaker 3>Bam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Snapped out of it,</v>

300
00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:27.740
<v Speaker 3>eats healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>organic.</v>

301
00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:30.290
<v Speaker 3>She's super mom who wasn't about her</v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

302
00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:35.680
<v Speaker 3>It also is about a fresh chance to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>something correct and raise a child</v>

303
00:14:37.311 --> 00:14:40.100
<v Speaker 3>would love and and not create someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>like yourself.</v>

304
00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:42.560
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's this weird eyeopening thing.</v>

305
00:14:42.561 --> 00:14:45.650
<v Speaker 3>I think for a lot of people when they</v>
<v Speaker 3>realize we're all,</v>

306
00:14:45.651 --> 00:14:49.580
<v Speaker 3>their anger comes from where all the oil</v>
<v Speaker 3>comes from not being raised correctly.</v>

307
00:14:49.581 --> 00:14:52.490
<v Speaker 3>That's a giant part of most people's</v>
<v Speaker 3>lives</v>

308
00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:55.850
<v Speaker 4>is what kind of an interaction you have</v>
<v Speaker 4>with the people that love you and if you</v>

309
00:14:55.851 --> 00:15:00.851
<v Speaker 4>get programmed like real early on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that love means hitting and screaming</v>

310
00:15:01.131 --> 00:15:06.131
<v Speaker 4>and chaos and yelling and fighting to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>By the time when I was a kid,</v>

311
00:15:06.531 --> 00:15:08.420
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I used to look about marriage,</v>

312
00:15:08.421 --> 00:15:11.960
<v Speaker 4>like somebody wanted a serve me plates</v>
<v Speaker 4>of shit for the rest of my life.</v>

313
00:15:11.961 --> 00:15:14.000
<v Speaker 4>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like why would you do it?</v>

314
00:15:14.001 --> 00:15:16.760
<v Speaker 4>Because what I grew up with was just</v>
<v Speaker 4>chaos.</v>

315
00:15:16.761 --> 00:15:20.600
<v Speaker 4>I grew up with people yelling at each</v>
<v Speaker 4>other and hitting each other and ah,</v>

316
00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:23.360
<v Speaker 4>fuck this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you don't realize.</v>

317
00:15:23.361 --> 00:15:27.110
<v Speaker 4>I think until you have a little baby</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you're watching,</v>

318
00:15:27.111 --> 00:15:29.840
<v Speaker 4>learn and develop and you sort of data</v>
<v Speaker 4>crunching all this shit,</v>

319
00:15:29.841 --> 00:15:33.530
<v Speaker 4>all these events in this child's life</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're experiencing all this with</v>

320
00:15:33.531 --> 00:15:37.930
<v Speaker 4>them and we're experiencing with them as</v>
<v Speaker 4>this intense bond of,</v>

321
00:15:37.931 --> 00:15:39.500
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of love,</v>

322
00:15:39.501 --> 00:15:43.790
<v Speaker 4>but have also have guidance so you have</v>
<v Speaker 4>to guide this little person and so while</v>

323
00:15:43.791 --> 00:15:47.660
<v Speaker 4>I'm doing that and just little moments</v>
<v Speaker 4>and events in my daughters' lives,</v>

324
00:15:47.661 --> 00:15:51.320
<v Speaker 4>little conversations that we have that</v>
<v Speaker 4>make me sort of process how they view</v>

325
00:15:51.321 --> 00:15:56.321
<v Speaker 4>the world and how they think about</v>
<v Speaker 4>things that has made me just so much</v>

326
00:15:56.991 --> 00:16:00.160
<v Speaker 4>more aware of where a lot of my own</v>

327
00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:05.220
<v Speaker 2>weird personality quirks have come from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like looking into your own eyes so</v>

328
00:16:06.191 --> 00:16:07.070
<v Speaker 2>you're seeing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

329
00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:09.440
<v Speaker 2>everything is instantly recognizable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a.</v>

330
00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:11.500
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good one.</v>

331
00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:16.420
<v Speaker 2>How would you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you said the seeing their perspective,</v>

332
00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:20.590
<v Speaker 2>but they're just mirroring whatever</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing it because they don't hide</v>

333
00:16:20.591 --> 00:16:21.424
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

334
00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:23.340
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't hide emotions.</v>

335
00:16:23.341 --> 00:16:26.970
<v Speaker 4>They don't hide thoughts and if you can</v>
<v Speaker 4>open up lines of communication with them</v>

336
00:16:26.971 --> 00:16:31.640
<v Speaker 4>really young and get them constantly</v>
<v Speaker 4>used to talking about feelings and about</v>

337
00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:34.530
<v Speaker 4>thoughts and about why do you get those</v>
<v Speaker 4>feelings?</v>

338
00:16:34.531 --> 00:16:35.880
<v Speaker 4>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

339
00:16:35.881 --> 00:16:38.820
<v Speaker 4>they'll get jealous of each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why does she get a new and why do you</v>

340
00:16:38.821 --> 00:16:40.050
<v Speaker 4>care?</v>
<v Speaker 4>She has a new tour.</v>

341
00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.620
<v Speaker 4>Like why does that bother you if</v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody else has something good and you</v>

342
00:16:43.621 --> 00:16:45.540
<v Speaker 4>see the little brain going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah,</v>

343
00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:48.960
<v Speaker 4>because this is like animal fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>instinct that makes you want to get</v>

344
00:16:48.961 --> 00:16:51.540
<v Speaker 4>upset about something and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

345
00:16:51.541 --> 00:16:53.460
<v Speaker 4>Her friend gave her a tour.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where's my shit?</v>

346
00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:54.630
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you gotta like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>That doesn't make any sense.</v>

351
00:17:00.271 --> 00:17:02.820
<v Speaker 4>Now does it be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah,</v>

352
00:17:02.821 --> 00:17:06.330

<v Speaker 4>tiny brain spinning on her</v>

<v Speaker 2>just starting to talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we'll get there.</v>

354
00:17:09.181 --> 00:17:12.810
<v Speaker 2>But now it's like trip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We really like playing drums together.</v>

355
00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:18.960
<v Speaker 2>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When he's talking to you,</v>

<v Speaker 2>it was there for awhile,</v>

358
00:17:23.610 --> 00:17:26.880
<v Speaker 2>there was this little period was like 10</v>
<v Speaker 2>words every day and you don't even know</v>

359
00:17:26.881 --> 00:17:29.160
<v Speaker 2>they're picking them up until they say</v>
<v Speaker 2>them and they'll look,</v>

360
00:17:29.161 --> 00:17:31.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at something and say it and you</v>

361
00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:34.320
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you haven't had this lesson yet.</v>

362
00:17:34.321 --> 00:17:35.310
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

363
00:17:35.311 --> 00:17:38.620
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for someone to express emotions and,</v>

364
00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:41.070
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or even to see them</v>

365
00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:45.750
<v Speaker 2>at such a young age and understanding</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to manipulate situations.</v>

366
00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:48.900
<v Speaker 2>That's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Social dynamic.</v>

367
00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:50.020
<v Speaker 2>You're worried</v>

368
00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:53.640
<v Speaker 1>like a primitive game of chess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A little primitive child.</v>

369
00:17:53.641 --> 00:17:58.641
<v Speaker 1>Chess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my daughter was three and we were skiing</v>

370
00:17:59.851 --> 00:18:03.780
<v Speaker 1>and she was packing her stuff up and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she didn't have her helmet or suitcase,</v>

371
00:18:03.781 --> 00:18:07.080
<v Speaker 1>so she had her suitcase closed and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>my wife goes,</v>

372
00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:08.680
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you forgot your pr,</v>

373
00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:09.710
<v Speaker 1>your helmet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she goes,</v>

374
00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:14.640
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was three when a three year old goes</v>

375
00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:17.370
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a nice long one.</v>

376
00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:21.750
<v Speaker 1>Just how to say it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a bite my hand to keep from</v>

377
00:18:21.751 --> 00:18:23.030
<v Speaker 1>laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

378
00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:27.210
<v Speaker 1>I try to encourage like stuff that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>funny as much as possible,</v>

379
00:18:27.211 --> 00:18:30.020
<v Speaker 1>but he can encourage him swearing</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they don't,</v>

380
00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:32.940
<v Speaker 1>they don't have the self control to like</v>
<v Speaker 1>shut it off and they go to school.</v>

381
00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:37.410
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to be the parents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They teach the kids.</v>

382
00:18:37.411 --> 00:18:39.210
<v Speaker 1>It's where on that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is fine.</v>

383
00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:44.240
<v Speaker 1>It really is the fuck are we doing is</v>
<v Speaker 1>restricting the use of words to</v>

384
00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:48.150
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's about over to the PC thing.</v>

385
00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:50.880
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's driving me fucking bananas.</v>

386
00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:56.490
<v Speaker 1>But this one is just fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it just so crazy.</v>

387
00:18:56.910 --> 00:18:57.990
<v Speaker 1>Why swears</v>

388
00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:06.530
<v Speaker 1>just seemed so strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like doesn't seem to be an issue most</v>

389
00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:08.420
<v Speaker 1>anywhere else in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Go.</v>

390
00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:11.420
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for adults in business,</v>

391
00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:15.920
<v Speaker 1>I kind of understand that using them</v>
<v Speaker 1>formalities for formalities mean if you</v>

392
00:19:15.921 --> 00:19:19.870
<v Speaker 1>want to know it is a lazy form of</v>
<v Speaker 1>linguistics though mean.</v>

393
00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:21.350
<v Speaker 1>Sure if you're just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Hey,</v>

394
00:19:21.351 --> 00:19:24.380
<v Speaker 1>it feels good so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it can be lazy,</v>

395
00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:27.860
<v Speaker 1>but it's like everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's stress related,</v>

396
00:19:27.861 --> 00:19:29.300
<v Speaker 1>honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man swearing.</v>

397
00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:32.360
<v Speaker 1>I think it really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it comes from anxieties and</v>

398
00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:36.890
<v Speaker 1>stress induced a variable variables.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember like in the navy,</v>

399
00:19:36.891 --> 00:19:38.000
<v Speaker 1>it's fuck this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck that,</v>

400
00:19:38.001 --> 00:19:40.500
<v Speaker 1>fuck every other word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when I worked at the railroad was</v>

401
00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:44.270
<v Speaker 1>salty language out there image because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're under this like highly efficient</v>

402
00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:48.800
<v Speaker 1>expectation all the time and there's all</v>
<v Speaker 1>these creative personalities and ideas</v>

403
00:19:48.801 --> 00:19:50.960
<v Speaker 1>bouncing off each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a little confined spaces and</v>

404
00:19:50.961 --> 00:19:53.510
<v Speaker 1>everybody's just wound tighter advantage</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the string.</v>

405
00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:54.791
<v Speaker 1>It could be used.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

406
00:19:54.791 --> 00:19:55.820
<v Speaker 1>gay always though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

407
00:19:55.821 --> 00:20:00.821
<v Speaker 1>It can also use as like a pause.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes people use use it in place of</v>

408
00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:03.800
<v Speaker 1>a meter tool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

409
00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:06.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes people don't know what they're</v>

410
00:20:06.501 --> 00:20:08.470
<v Speaker 1>gonna say next and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

411
00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:13.040
<v Speaker 1>but instead they're replacing with fuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>like fucking fucking guy with his</v>

412
00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:15.550
<v Speaker 1>fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking sitting there,</v>

413
00:20:15.551 --> 00:20:16.740
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking talking to us,</v>

414
00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:17.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that kind of.</v>

415
00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:22.460
<v Speaker 1>That's where it gets real lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what most people don't even</v>

416
00:20:22.461 --> 00:20:24.500
<v Speaker 1>realize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the weird ticks they have.</v>

417
00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:27.140
<v Speaker 1>I didn't realize how many times I'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

418
00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:29.000
<v Speaker 1>or you know what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or,</v>

419
00:20:29.001 --> 00:20:33.770
<v Speaker 1>or like the word like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like isn't fucking dangerous one because</v>

420
00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:36.860
<v Speaker 1>you could be talking to someone and not</v>
<v Speaker 1>pick it up.</v>

421
00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:38.590
<v Speaker 1>But then once you do pick it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

422
00:20:38.591 --> 00:20:42.380
<v Speaker 1>it's all here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all you hear like people have that</v>

423
00:20:42.381 --> 00:20:46.010
<v Speaker 1>little and we're roadblock and they have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a blind side.</v>

424
00:20:46.011 --> 00:20:48.070
<v Speaker 1>They didn't see it a blind spot and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>just say like</v>

425
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:53.070
<v Speaker 3>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's terrifying because it might be me.</v>

426
00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:58.220
<v Speaker 3>I definitely have been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tommy has got a bad score.</v>

427
00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:00.420
<v Speaker 3>Has got it bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got it bad.</v>

428
00:21:00.421 --> 00:21:03.840
<v Speaker 3>He's a like a hawk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He loves the hymns it up a little bit.</v>

429
00:21:03.841 --> 00:21:06.630
<v Speaker 3>But like in that video he did in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cleveland this weekend.</v>

430
00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:07.860
<v Speaker 3>Did you see that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't see that.</v>

431
00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:10.680
<v Speaker 3>That's really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was it him in Hannibal burress?</v>

432
00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:11.011
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

433
00:21:11.011 --> 00:21:12.900
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was on a news.</v>

434
00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:15.410
<v Speaker 3>Was playing that character.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

435
00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:16.253
<v Speaker 3>I did see that.</v>

436
00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:19.970
<v Speaker 2>Our friend Thompson girl was in this</v>
<v Speaker 2>morning show.</v>

437
00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:22.190
<v Speaker 2>He ever do those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have to do those morning shows?</v>

438
00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:27.500
<v Speaker 2>I don't do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My career will suffer to some degree</v>

439
00:21:27.501 --> 00:21:28.640
<v Speaker 2>with cause of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but man,</v>

440
00:21:28.641 --> 00:21:30.230
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

441
00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:33.280
<v Speaker 2>I would never ask anyone to deal with me</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a situation like that.</v>

442
00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:36.440
<v Speaker 2>So it's best just to know what you are.</v>

443
00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:38.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And accepted.</v>

444
00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:41.860
<v Speaker 3>Do you get a hard time for not wanting</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do like certain kinds of press?</v>

445
00:21:41.861 --> 00:21:42.860
<v Speaker 3>Do they give you a hard time?</v>

446
00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:44.280
<v Speaker 2>Not really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

447
00:21:44.281 --> 00:21:47.880
<v Speaker 2>I think most of the people who have been</v>
<v Speaker 2>working with for awhile now,</v>

448
00:21:47.881 --> 00:21:50.340
<v Speaker 2>they know who they're dealing with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

449
00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:51.690
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

450
00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:54.180
<v Speaker 2>I don't mind doing the press honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

451
00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:59.240
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at a certain point it becomes I think</v>

452
00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:04.320
<v Speaker 2>counterproductive or even destructive</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's,</v>

453
00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:08.310
<v Speaker 2>you don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just repeating things a lot to the</v>

454
00:22:08.311 --> 00:22:11.430
<v Speaker 2>point that you're asked the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>question so many times that without even</v>

455
00:22:11.431 --> 00:22:14.460
<v Speaker 2>realizing you find yourself giving</v>
<v Speaker 2>verbatim answers.</v>

456
00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:19.700
<v Speaker 2>Whereas when you know it's time to stop</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about it because it's a like,</v>

457
00:22:20.910 --> 00:22:22.920
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more I feel like I talk about it,</v>

458
00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:28.530
<v Speaker 2>you sort of denying people their a</v>
<v Speaker 2>better chance to interpret in a way</v>

459
00:22:28.531 --> 00:22:32.520
<v Speaker 2>that's going to make it mean even more</v>
<v Speaker 2>to them in the hero in a way that maybe</v>

460
00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:34.910
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even mean it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does the,</v>

461
00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:38.130
<v Speaker 2>your memories become weird to you and</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about them all the time too.</v>

462
00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:42.030
<v Speaker 2>When you talk about certain things and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you repeat yourself over and over again,</v>

463
00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:44.100
<v Speaker 2>it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It almost becomes a script to you,</v>

464
00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:47.160
<v Speaker 2>like the memories get weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I realized,</v>

465
00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:48.473
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

466
00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:51.120
<v Speaker 2>I've been playing music forever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but all this other stuff was very sudden</v>

467
00:22:51.121 --> 00:22:54.980
<v Speaker 2>transition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but being a skeptical,</v>

468
00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:58.800
<v Speaker 2>naturally skeptical person and self</v>
<v Speaker 2>aware like you get in these situations</v>

469
00:22:58.801 --> 00:23:01.350
<v Speaker 2>and I sort of realized there's a certain</v>
<v Speaker 2>theatrical to it all,</v>

470
00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:04.770
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and and then once you get past the</v>

471
00:23:04.771 --> 00:23:08.910
<v Speaker 2>reality of that and then you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you learn enough about it to know that</v>

472
00:23:08.911 --> 00:23:12.120
<v Speaker 2>you can sit and talk for three hours</v>
<v Speaker 2>literally,</v>

473
00:23:12.121 --> 00:23:15.120
<v Speaker 2>but it's not a representation of what</v>
<v Speaker 2>you talked about.</v>

474
00:23:15.121 --> 00:23:17.970
<v Speaker 2>You can talk about everything under the</v>
<v Speaker 2>sun and they might take one little</v>

475
00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:22.110
<v Speaker 2>sentence that had nothing to do with</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything and an editor decides that that</v>

476
00:23:22.111 --> 00:23:27.111
<v Speaker 2>should be the title of the article that</v>
<v Speaker 2>has now written from some preconceived</v>

477
00:23:27.541 --> 00:23:29.700
<v Speaker 2>stance that you did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were unaware of during the</v>

478
00:23:29.701 --> 00:23:31.020
<v Speaker 2>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

479
00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:34.900
<v Speaker 2>It's like</v>
<v Speaker 2>word is especially problematic.</v>

480
00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:36.000
<v Speaker 2>Print context</v>

481
00:23:36.810 --> 00:23:40.040
<v Speaker 3>can't print context and it's literally</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone's interpretation.</v>

482
00:23:40.041 --> 00:23:43.010
<v Speaker 3>It's art.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's interpreting an individual,</v>

483
00:23:43.011 --> 00:23:46.670
<v Speaker 3>so if someone writes a story about you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really art because it's their own</v>

484
00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:50.030
<v Speaker 3>way of flavoring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This whole interaction they try to do</v>

485
00:23:50.031 --> 00:23:55.031
<v Speaker 3>with colorful descriptives and they try</v>
<v Speaker 3>to use bold adjectives and try to figure</v>

486
00:23:56.091 --> 00:24:01.091
<v Speaker 3>out a way to paint it in the most</v>
<v Speaker 3>entertaining way as well as get some</v>

487
00:24:01.161 --> 00:24:04.460
<v Speaker 3>point across.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think sometimes a lot of guys are</v>

488
00:24:04.461 --> 00:24:06.460
<v Speaker 3>also just trying to get you to click on</v>
<v Speaker 3>their website.</v>

489
00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:07.370
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That true.</v>

490
00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:10.280
<v Speaker 3>But the way to do that is with a good</v>
<v Speaker 3>entertainment.</v>

491
00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:15.650
<v Speaker 3>So it doesn't necessarily have to be an</v>
<v Speaker 3>actual factual representation of who you</v>

492
00:24:15.651 --> 00:24:17.450
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if someone writes a story about</v>

493
00:24:17.451 --> 00:24:20.690
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what's almost more important is</v>

494
00:24:20.691 --> 00:24:25.670
<v Speaker 3>this art of getting something salacious</v>
<v Speaker 3>is art of writing something,</v>

495
00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:27.560
<v Speaker 3>something that makes you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

496
00:24:27.561 --> 00:24:30.320
<v Speaker 3>this guy's wild or this guy's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

497
00:24:30.450 --> 00:24:34.470
<v Speaker 3>it has to be like this one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sturgill Simpson first fucked up man</v>

498
00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:35.560
<v Speaker 3>when he was 14,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

499
00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:38.060
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like something like first sentence,</v>

500
00:24:38.061 --> 00:24:39.110
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey Jesus,</v>

501
00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:41.600
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is this article going?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

502
00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:44.090
<v Speaker 3>not really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he would have you believe that you</v>

503
00:24:44.091 --> 00:24:45.950
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the enemy like it starts.</v>

504
00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:47.250
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

505
00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:51.620
<v Speaker 2>I didn't realize it until it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you meet people on the street and</v>

506
00:24:51.621 --> 00:24:56.621
<v Speaker 2>you realize they have these crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>misinformed ideas about who you are and</v>

507
00:24:57.081 --> 00:25:00.710
<v Speaker 2>what you represent and like</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you are.</v>

508
00:25:00.711 --> 00:25:03.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know those,</v>

509
00:25:03.051 --> 00:25:04.160
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a good lesson learned.</v>

510
00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:06.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good lesson for anybody.</v>

511
00:25:06.181 --> 00:25:08.480
<v Speaker 2>She would just kind of a dork.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what's that?</v>

512
00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:10.540
<v Speaker 2>It's really just like a dork and you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're like,</v>

513
00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:13.640
<v Speaker 2>this is outlaw tough guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

514
00:25:13.641 --> 00:25:14.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking dirt.</v>

515
00:25:14.961 --> 00:25:17.570
<v Speaker 2>The dirt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what they think.</v>

516
00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:19.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of them,</v>

517
00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:21.920
<v Speaker 2>some of them probably do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're always looking for that though,</v>

518
00:25:21.921 --> 00:25:26.090
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think for the outlaw country guy seems</v>

519
00:25:26.091 --> 00:25:26.924
<v Speaker 2>to be the case.</v>

520
00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:30.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that was the shooter had a song</v>

521
00:25:30.071 --> 00:25:32.620
<v Speaker 3>making fun of all these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like fake outlaws.</v>

522
00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:37.450
<v Speaker 3>They have all that shit to his dad did</v>
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

523
00:25:37.451 --> 00:25:40.000
<v Speaker 3>His Dad was the real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

524
00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:45.010
<v Speaker 3>it's got to be hard to look at some fake</v>
<v Speaker 3>outlaws with designer scratches in their</v>

525
00:25:45.281 --> 00:25:47.230
<v Speaker 3>genes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they got attacked by a fucking</v>

526
00:25:47.231 --> 00:25:48.840
<v Speaker 3>leopard or some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

527
00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:53.050
<v Speaker 3>that looks so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when your dad is fucking waylon</v>

528
00:25:53.051 --> 00:25:56.270
<v Speaker 3>jennings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's got to be even more offensive.</v>

529
00:25:56.271 --> 00:25:57.200
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine man,</v>

530
00:25:57.580 --> 00:25:59.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they see these guys with a hat that</v>

531
00:25:59.111 --> 00:26:01.630
<v Speaker 3>they just got 15 minutes for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They went on stage,</v>

532
00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:05.670
<v Speaker 3>someone handed so placed it perfectly</v>
<v Speaker 3>and someone's doing their hair and</v>

533
00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:06.970
<v Speaker 3>checking in and making sure everything's</v>
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

534
00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:08.890
<v Speaker 3>Then they send them out there to be an</v>
<v Speaker 3>outlaw</v>

535
00:26:11.710 --> 00:26:15.250
<v Speaker 3>sober on adderall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably Beta blockers.</v>

536
00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:22.980
<v Speaker 2>It's something that I couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't possibly describe to you how</v>

537
00:26:23.091 --> 00:26:25.790
<v Speaker 2>little I pay attention to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

538
00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:29.990
<v Speaker 2>To cut to a country or to music in</v>
<v Speaker 2>general country.</v>

539
00:26:29.991 --> 00:26:34.160
<v Speaker 2>But even anymore I don't really listen</v>

557
00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:14.180
<v Speaker 1>That's the other thing about this job</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

558
00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:16.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you meet people that you hit it off with</v>

559
00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:18.450
<v Speaker 1>but you never hang out because you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>never at home.</v>

560
00:27:18.451 --> 00:27:20.840
<v Speaker 1>So we've was trying for like two years</v>
<v Speaker 1>to take our wives.</v>

561
00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:24.780
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You either on tour or somebody back or.</v>

562
00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:28.650
<v Speaker 1>I know exactly what it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know exactly what it's like a</v>

563
00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:30.210
<v Speaker 1>comedian's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We worked together a lot.</v>

564
00:27:30.390 --> 00:27:33.540
<v Speaker 1>That's how we do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We also worked together at the store.</v>

565
00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:35.490
<v Speaker 1>That's why the store is like a great</v>
<v Speaker 1>base.</v>

566
00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:38.190
<v Speaker 1>It's like home base,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so everybody goes to the store so we</v>

567
00:27:38.191 --> 00:27:41.070
<v Speaker 1>meet each other in the store during the</v>
<v Speaker 1>weeknights and then a lot of times on</v>

568
00:27:41.071 --> 00:27:44.430
<v Speaker 1>the weekends we'll work together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like if we do big theater shows,</v>

569
00:27:44.431 --> 00:27:47.700
<v Speaker 1>especially</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think you're down there,</v>

570
00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:51.690
<v Speaker 1>the store,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm at least to always at least two.</v>

571
00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:52.830
<v Speaker 1>Just working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

572
00:27:52.831 --> 00:27:55.380
<v Speaker 1>it depends on how many nights I'm in</v>
<v Speaker 1>town,</v>

573
00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:56.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

574
00:27:56.331 --> 00:27:59.880
<v Speaker 1>it's convenient for me because my spots</v>
<v Speaker 1>are always after 10 so my kids are</v>

575
00:27:59.881 --> 00:28:03.180
<v Speaker 1>already asleep so I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can jet out after I put them to bed,</v>

576
00:28:03.181 --> 00:28:04.080
<v Speaker 1>I can get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>chat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>testing out new stuff.</v>

590
00:28:36.361 --> 00:28:38.550
<v Speaker 1>All the above.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just working,</v>

591
00:28:38.610 --> 00:28:42.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like they're at everyone's act as</v>

592
00:28:42.071 --> 00:28:44.030
<v Speaker 1>sort of like a work of progress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

593
00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:45.990
<v Speaker 1>and when you're close to them and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch it from,</v>

594
00:28:45.991 --> 00:28:48.240
<v Speaker 1>they'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Joey Diaz who I think is the</v>

595
00:28:48.241 --> 00:28:50.580
<v Speaker 1>funniest guy of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the funniest guy ever.</v>

596
00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.890
<v Speaker 1>Never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never laughed harder than watching him.</v>

597
00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:54.510
<v Speaker 1>But I watch his bits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

598
00:28:54.511 --> 00:28:57.810
<v Speaker 1>watch them develop like a because I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>working with them all the time.</v>

599
00:28:58.050 --> 00:29:00.960
<v Speaker 1>That's some of the more interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>things about.</v>

600
00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:04.230
<v Speaker 1>One of the more interesting things about</v>
<v Speaker 1>being friends with a lot of comedians is</v>

601
00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:07.050
<v Speaker 1>watching all the different styles of</v>
<v Speaker 1>creation,</v>

602
00:29:07.051 --> 00:29:08.820
<v Speaker 1>how they do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how they piece it together.</v>

603
00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:11.130
<v Speaker 1>It's just like songwriting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like,</v>

604
00:29:11.131 --> 00:29:13.700
<v Speaker 1>there's no right way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah Man,</v>

605
00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:15.090
<v Speaker 1>I tell you what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to,</v>

606
00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:15.990
<v Speaker 1>I've only,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

607
00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:17.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm just now getting to spend any time</v>
<v Speaker 1>out here.</v>

608
00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:22.230
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's something about that world</v>

609
00:29:22.231 --> 00:29:24.540
<v Speaker 1>just a couple of times I've gone and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've spent time in that place.</v>

610
00:29:24.550 --> 00:29:29.400
<v Speaker 1>It's a totally different head space than</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything I'm used to or accustomed to.</v>

611
00:29:29.401 --> 00:29:32.280
<v Speaker 1>And you can see there's definitely a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of community.</v>

612
00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:33.660
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a,</v>

613
00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:36.960
<v Speaker 1>a palatable underlying darkness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

614
00:29:36.961 --> 00:29:40.230
<v Speaker 1>To at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think what I liked the most about</v>

615
00:29:40.231 --> 00:29:41.770
<v Speaker 1>it is there's no area,</v>

616
00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:43.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for all in all,</v>

617
00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:47.620
<v Speaker 3>everybody seems to be pretty black and</v>
<v Speaker 3>white and like real as fuck,</v>

618
00:29:47.621 --> 00:29:50.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can get away with some ridiculous</v>

619
00:29:50.831 --> 00:29:54.870
<v Speaker 3>shit on that stage two because it's just</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way it's always been like,</v>

620
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.580
<v Speaker 3>like holtzman without giving any of his</v>
<v Speaker 3>set away.</v>

621
00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:01.420
<v Speaker 3>Some of the things that he was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you like Jesus fucking Christ?</v>

622
00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:02.283
<v Speaker 3>Oh Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was.</v>

623
00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:05.830
<v Speaker 3>I mean I know you're enjoying that</v>
<v Speaker 3>because also they're just like,</v>

624
00:30:07.650 --> 00:30:11.410
<v Speaker 3>oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was particularly on fire that night</v>

625
00:30:11.411 --> 00:30:14.920
<v Speaker 3>too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the screaming at people and so what</v>

626
00:30:14.921 --> 00:30:18.160
<v Speaker 3>happens when somebody gets up and just</v>
<v Speaker 3>jumps on the stage and goes for him?</v>

627
00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:20.680
<v Speaker 3>Because it happened before his</v>
<v Speaker 3>girlfriend.</v>

628
00:30:20.681 --> 00:30:22.090
<v Speaker 3>I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is happening?</v>

629
00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:25.480
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was intense.</v>

630
00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:28.690
<v Speaker 3>But the people were laughing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but people have attacked him.</v>

631
00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:29.860
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

632
00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:31.660
<v Speaker 3>Martin Lawrence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his bodyguard.</v>

633
00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:35.650
<v Speaker 3>Ego Self.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I wasn't there.</v>

634
00:30:35.650 --> 00:30:39.460
<v Speaker 3>I missed the festivities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but from what I understand,</v>

635
00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:44.380
<v Speaker 3>Martin Lawrence was in the audience and</v>
<v Speaker 3>him and Holtzman like we're going back</v>

636
00:30:44.381 --> 00:30:47.710
<v Speaker 3>and forth and Holtzman went over to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>table to point out that it was actually</v>

637
00:30:47.711 --> 00:30:49.630
<v Speaker 3>Martin Lawrence that he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was,</v>

638
00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:52.080
<v Speaker 3>he was being heckled by Martins</v>
<v Speaker 3>bodyguard,</v>

639
00:30:52.090 --> 00:30:53.890
<v Speaker 3>gets up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>punched him in the head and knocked him</v>

640
00:30:53.891 --> 00:30:55.450
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was one time I heard,</v>

641
00:30:56.010 --> 00:30:57.550
<v Speaker 3>but there was some other stuff too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Damn.</v>

642
00:30:57.790 --> 00:31:01.720
<v Speaker 3>One time he took a fucking an ashtray.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Ari was talking about this the other</v>

643
00:31:01.721 --> 00:31:03.340
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The comedy store,</v>

644
00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:07.120
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially like in the early days had</v>

645
00:31:07.121 --> 00:31:11.670
<v Speaker 3>these thick fucking glass ashtrays,</v>
<v Speaker 3>old school school for Ashtrays.</v>

646
00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:14.110
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure many people got murdered with</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of those fucking things.</v>

647
00:31:14.970 --> 00:31:19.970
<v Speaker 3>Holtzman was talking about Charlie's</v>
<v Speaker 3>angels and how angry he was that anybody</v>

648
00:31:20.771 --> 00:31:24.070
<v Speaker 3>really believes how a woman could kick</v>
<v Speaker 3>all those meds.</v>

649
00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:26.850
<v Speaker 3>I take already grabs that ashtray.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

650
00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:31.000
<v Speaker 3>fucking crusher had he throws the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Astraea at the table and shatters his</v>

651
00:31:31.001 --> 00:31:32.110
<v Speaker 3>fucking ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trey.</v>

652
00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:33.980
<v Speaker 3>Holy Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

653
00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:35.380
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>

654
00:31:35.770 --> 00:31:38.470
<v Speaker 3>He blew an ash tray up in the room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

655
00:31:39.910 --> 00:31:42.850
<v Speaker 3>glass flying all over the fucking place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

656
00:31:42.851 --> 00:31:46.090
<v Speaker 3>he really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>through this ashtray down on this table</v>

657
00:31:46.150 --> 00:31:49.000
<v Speaker 3>and shattered it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a small crowd,</v>

658
00:31:49.210 --> 00:31:54.210
<v Speaker 3>but someone easily could've got hit with</v>
<v Speaker 3>a honker glass that probably that class</v>

659
00:31:54.641 --> 00:31:55.690
<v Speaker 3>probably still on that ground.</v>

660
00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:02.170
<v Speaker 3>He definitely could probably find the</v>
<v Speaker 3>sharp dude,</v>

661
00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:04.840
<v Speaker 3>but he's going for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

662
00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:07.190
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

663
00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:09.190
<v Speaker 3>it's one of those things we were talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>

664
00:32:09.191 --> 00:32:12.160
<v Speaker 3>like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a.</v>

665
00:32:12.190 --> 00:32:15.160
<v Speaker 3>When you're writing a song,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess it's probably similar to where</v>

666
00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:17.530
<v Speaker 3>you are creating this narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

667
00:32:17.531 --> 00:32:18.020
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

668
00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:23.020
<v Speaker 3>you're being a separate person maybe</v>
<v Speaker 3>than you are in real life and you're</v>

669
00:32:25.991 --> 00:32:28.510
<v Speaker 3>creating it and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're seeing it from that person's</v>

670
00:32:28.511 --> 00:32:31.360
<v Speaker 3>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when a guy like holtzman is doing</v>

671
00:32:31.361 --> 00:32:33.760
<v Speaker 3>that on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's doing something similar,</v>

672
00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:39.180
<v Speaker 3>but because it's just talking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people don't accept it as not his</v>

673
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:41.930
<v Speaker 1>opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

674
00:32:41.931 --> 00:32:44.060
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think that he's just a fucking</v>

675
00:32:44.061 --> 00:32:46.640
<v Speaker 1>asshole and a misogynist and the this</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the that.</v>

676
00:32:46.641 --> 00:32:51.260
<v Speaker 1>And it's not just like he's a character</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a movie that's playing and asshole.</v>

677
00:32:51.261 --> 00:32:56.261
<v Speaker 1>That's happened to be hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which we accept with no reservation too</v>

678
00:32:56.921 --> 00:32:57.754
<v Speaker 1>weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

679
00:32:59.030 --> 00:32:59.900
<v Speaker 1>It's A.</v>

680
00:33:01.690 --> 00:33:02.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just sitting there,</v>

681
00:33:02.871 --> 00:33:07.130
<v Speaker 1>we're really after the fact and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking back on what I just seen how</v>

682
00:33:07.970 --> 00:33:10.670
<v Speaker 1>when he's in the moment of playing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>frustrated,</v>

683
00:33:11.390 --> 00:33:13.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you have such,</v>

684
00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:15.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what's the fucking,</v>

685
00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:16.220
<v Speaker 1>what's the point?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

686
00:33:16.890 --> 00:33:20.870
<v Speaker 1>but it's so he was just so in that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>has to make me feel like a part big part</v>

687
00:33:20.871 --> 00:33:22.940
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's coming from a real place to,</v>

688
00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:24.110
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

689
00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:25.460
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just.</v>

690
00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:27.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's not carrying that around</v>
<v Speaker 1>with them all the time,</v>

691
00:33:27.831 --> 00:33:29.780
<v Speaker 1>but that's definitely coming from a real</v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

692
00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:33.330
<v Speaker 1>He has been about Hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't give it away in a way.</v>

693
00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:34.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

694
00:33:34.491 --> 00:33:36.090
<v Speaker 1>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he's like,</v>

695
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:39.770
<v Speaker 1>he's a very smart guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously he's legitimately frustrated</v>

696
00:33:39.771 --> 00:33:42.260
<v Speaker 1>at the world around him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know who isn't,</v>

697
00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:46.310
<v Speaker 1>but if you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're not paying attention.</v>

698
00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:49.160
<v Speaker 1>It's that simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this day and age,</v>

699
00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:51.170
<v Speaker 1>look you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we all should try to do,</v>

700
00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:55.490
<v Speaker 1>and I know you agree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is try to be as harmonious as you can in</v>

702
00:33:57.261 --> 00:34:02.261
<v Speaker 1>friendships harmonious as he can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem today is that in this day</v>

703
00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:06.080
<v Speaker 1>and age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have access to all the stories,</v>

704
00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:09.530

<v Speaker 1>There's too many of us.</v>

705
00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:13.340
<v Speaker 1>That's too much data to crunch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're only going to get the shitty ones</v>

00:34:20.950 --> 00:34:23.570
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry about isis and things like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

711
00:34:23.571 --> 00:34:27.950
<v Speaker 1>Worry more about natural disasters will</v>
<v Speaker 1>weirdest,</v>

712
00:34:27.951 --> 00:34:31.700
<v Speaker 1>weirdest to say that whatever we talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I get hung up on fault lines and</v>

725
00:34:58.081 --> 00:34:59.400
<v Speaker 1>was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't even look at this.</v>

726
00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:01.500
<v Speaker 1>We still never found out who called</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

727
00:35:01.501 --> 00:35:05.970
<v Speaker 1>Y'All Qaeda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we believe someone on the show named</v>

<v Speaker 1>them yell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kil Kinda.</v>

729
00:35:07.530 --> 00:35:10.300
<v Speaker 1>It was either that or was it a comic</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we named them?</v>

730
00:35:11.090 --> 00:35:13.800
<v Speaker 1>I saw it a lot of times on Google,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I don't know where it started,</v>

731
00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:17.030
<v Speaker 1>but might not have even started there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the person who said it might've</v>

732
00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:18.840
<v Speaker 1>heard it first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Either way,</v>

733
00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:20.730
<v Speaker 1>what a fucking great name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Y'All Qaeda.</v>

734
00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:22.860
<v Speaker 1>I fuckin love that name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did,</v>

735
00:35:22.890 --> 00:35:23.723
<v Speaker 1>what did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did.</v>

736
00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:25.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I honestly did step away,</v>

737
00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:27.630
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't end up happening with all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

738
00:35:27.631 --> 00:35:31.890
<v Speaker 1>one guy got shot and killed and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was uh,</v>

739
00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:35.190
<v Speaker 1>some guys turned themselves in and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

740
00:35:35.191 --> 00:35:38.290
<v Speaker 1>there was a standoff for a long period</v>
<v Speaker 1>of time had do with grazing</v>

741
00:35:38.290 --> 00:35:41.910
<v Speaker 3>and cattle cattle on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on public land.</v>

742
00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:45.120
<v Speaker 3>We call it department of land</v>
<v Speaker 3>management.</v>

743
00:35:45.390 --> 00:35:48.380
<v Speaker 3>Dlm is a dlm land.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that it?</v>

744
00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:49.890
<v Speaker 3>Bureau land management.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Blm,</v>

745
00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:51.113
<v Speaker 3>Blm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>

746
00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:54.900
<v Speaker 3>There's a mountain range and he taught</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would still be on Blm land and a lot</v>

747
00:35:54.901 --> 00:35:59.901
<v Speaker 3>of the hunters for literally 100,</v>
<v Speaker 3>100 year ban on is the Okra,</v>

748
00:36:01.770 --> 00:36:03.960
<v Speaker 3>I think Okra,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mountain range and valley.</v>

749
00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:06.720
<v Speaker 3>And they were getting ready to open it</v>
<v Speaker 3>back up after a hundred years.</v>

750
00:36:06.721 --> 00:36:08.430
<v Speaker 3>So they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

751
00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:11.580
<v Speaker 3>most people don't have this and their</v>
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>

752
00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:16.170
<v Speaker 3>Most countries don't have a giant swaths</v>
<v Speaker 3>of public land that you can hunt and</v>

753
00:36:16.171 --> 00:36:17.330
<v Speaker 3>fish on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

754
00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:21.480
<v Speaker 3>That was all because of Teddy Roosevelt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Teddy Roosevelt faced so much pressure</v>

755
00:36:21.481 --> 00:36:23.910
<v Speaker 3>to not to not do that and to give in to</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

756
00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:27.090
<v Speaker 3>that he wound up leaving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was he a Republican or Democrat?</v>

757
00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:32.790
<v Speaker 3>I feel like the Democrats used to be the</v>
<v Speaker 3>more conservative ones back in the day</v>

758
00:36:33.450 --> 00:36:36.750
<v Speaker 3>and then the Republicans were the more</v>
<v Speaker 3>open minded and liberal.</v>

759
00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:39.780
<v Speaker 3>Then somewhere along the line,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the polar axis is shifted.</v>

760
00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:42.930
<v Speaker 3>That's what I've written.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Read Rather.</v>

761
00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:45.300
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Teddy Roosevelt,</v>

762
00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:51.020
<v Speaker 3>he deemed all of this land all over the</v>
<v Speaker 3>country as public land.</v>

763
00:36:51.390 --> 00:36:53.850
<v Speaker 3>And you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could never do anything with it.</v>

764
00:36:53.851 --> 00:36:57.450
<v Speaker 3>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't fucking put cities in it.</v>

765
00:36:57.870 --> 00:37:01.280
<v Speaker 3>You can't do shit with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is just public land and this is</v>

766
00:37:01.290 --> 00:37:03.180
<v Speaker 3>land owned by the people of the United</v>
<v Speaker 3>States.</v>

767
00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:07.410
<v Speaker 3>And there's been a lot of like really</v>
<v Speaker 3>shady politicians that have looked at</v>

768
00:37:07.411 --> 00:37:11.360
<v Speaker 3>our debt because the United States has</v>
<v Speaker 3>massive debt and they'd said,</v>

769
00:37:11.361 --> 00:37:13.080
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is one way we can get rid of this</v>

770
00:37:13.081 --> 00:37:15.810
<v Speaker 3>debt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can sell some of our public land.</v>

771
00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:18.720
<v Speaker 3>I think Paul Ryan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy that's one of the presidential</v>

772
00:37:18.721 --> 00:37:21.390
<v Speaker 3>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>think he bowed out of the presidential</v>

773
00:37:21.391 --> 00:37:23.790
<v Speaker 3>election,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was one of the guys that was.</v>

774
00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:29.100
<v Speaker 3>It was one of his proposals and people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the outdoors people,</v>

775
00:37:29.101 --> 00:37:31.260
<v Speaker 3>people that hike and hunt and fish.</v>

776
00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:34.610
<v Speaker 3>They were going fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you can't do this like you can't.</v>

777
00:37:34.650 --> 00:37:36.750
<v Speaker 3>But.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you look at it on CNN,</v>

778
00:37:37.250 --> 00:37:40.770
<v Speaker 3>it's like one of the most important</v>
<v Speaker 3>things about what makes this country</v>

779
00:37:40.771 --> 00:37:43.260
<v Speaker 3>amazing is some of our natural</v>
<v Speaker 3>resources,</v>

780
00:37:43.261 --> 00:37:45.160
<v Speaker 3>our parks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing else like it on the planet to</v>

<v Speaker 3>a grizzly bear and you see a herd of</v>

<v Speaker 3>You can go through this park and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>might get eaten by a grizzly.</v>

790

00:38:46.751 --> 00:38:50.830
<v Speaker 2>but it's this like 20 story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>high cabin.</v>

<v Speaker 2>really old to me over 100 years old with</v>

<v Speaker 2>lived in it,</v>

814
00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:06.790
<v Speaker 2>but it's pretty much like the coolest</v>
<v Speaker 2>treehouse you'll ever see anywhere on</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We know.</v>

<v Speaker 4>We know about going up the coast to Sam.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm saying?</v>

827
00:39:36.931 --> 00:39:40.110
<v Speaker 4>We don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But in the Teddy Roosevelt days stay</v>

828
00:39:40.111 --> 00:39:43.520
<v Speaker 4>where they were still like 50 years into</v>
<v Speaker 4>picture.</v>

829
00:39:43.530 --> 00:39:48.330
<v Speaker 4>Undaunted courage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Their first pictures were in the late 18</v>

830
00:39:48.331 --> 00:39:49.164
<v Speaker 4>hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

831
00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:53.170
<v Speaker 4>So the Teddy Roosevelt age.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean this motherfucker was,</v>

832
00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:56.520
<v Speaker 4>they barely knew anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No the fuck.</v>

833
00:39:56.521 --> 00:39:56.931
<v Speaker 4>Did they.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How?</v>

<v Speaker 4>Early 19 hundreds.</v>

835
00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:02.850
<v Speaker 4>Nine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So think about that.</v>

836
00:40:02.851 --> 00:40:06.270
<v Speaker 4>They'd only had pictures for like what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>50 or 60 years.</v>

<v Speaker 4>wildlife you're going to run into about</v>
<v Speaker 4>a wolverine.</v>

<v Speaker 4>thing for the first time going,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Fuck,</v>

843
00:40:25.291 --> 00:40:27.900

<v Speaker 4>I was watching this video the other day</v>

844
00:40:27.901 --> 00:40:31.020
<v Speaker 4>with this dude who was driving his</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking car.</v>

845
00:40:31.230 --> 00:40:36.230
<v Speaker 4>He watched a wolf and a c and a mountain</v>
<v Speaker 4>lion fighting to the death there would</v>

846
00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:40.770
<v Speaker 4>duke it out right in front of him and he</v>
<v Speaker 4>stopped his car and he said they were so</v>

847
00:40:40.771 --> 00:40:43.440
<v Speaker 4>close that he could reach out and touch</v>
<v Speaker 4>the wolf.</v>

848
00:40:44.070 --> 00:40:47.520
<v Speaker 4>And so he's sitting there in his car</v>
<v Speaker 4>while there's wolf and this mount line</v>

849
00:40:47.550 --> 00:40:52.020
<v Speaker 4>or fucking engaged in mortal combat.</v>

851
00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:58.470

<v Speaker 4>see that.</v>

852
00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:01.760
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you were in the teddy rose,</v>

853
00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:04.180
<v Speaker 2>if I knew they weren't coming through</v>
<v Speaker 2>the windshield.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

856
00:41:06.871 --> 00:41:08.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we drove through yellowstone every time.</v>

857
00:41:08.610 --> 00:41:11.000
<v Speaker 2>It never fails if there is a grizzly</v>
<v Speaker 2>citing.</v>

858
00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:13.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

859
00:41:13.331 --> 00:41:16.480
<v Speaker 2>carloads of people standing out on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>street with their cameras out and</v>

860
00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:19.630
<v Speaker 2>arranger standards saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please get back in your car.</v>

861
00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:20.100
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

862
00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:23.010

<v Speaker 2>The guy was so sardonic about it.</v>

863
00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:24.910
<v Speaker 2>It was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is amazing.</v>

866
00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:30.750
<v Speaker 4>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the mountain lions.</v>

867
00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:32.260

<v Speaker 2>Look at the mountain lion winning.</v>

870
00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:40.760
<v Speaker 2>I think I'd rather get eaten by a great</v>
<v Speaker 2>white shark and taken out by a cougar</v>

871
00:41:40.761 --> 00:41:42.800
<v Speaker 2>man because it's going to play with you</v>

00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:18.930
<v Speaker 2>Was hiking on antelope island one time</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

884
00:42:18.931 --> 00:42:22.340
<v Speaker 2>just north of Utah and they have this</v>
<v Speaker 2>big buffalo reserve out there.</v>

885
00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:24.900
<v Speaker 2>It's like a public peak probably six</v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

<v Speaker 2>it's coming back down the hill.</v>

889
00:42:32.790 --> 00:42:36.030
<v Speaker 2>Me and my buddy and as we were hiking</v>
<v Speaker 2>down a trail,</v>

00:42:36.031 --> 00:42:37.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about 300 yards down,</v>

891
00:42:37.351 --> 00:42:39.330
<v Speaker 2>I can see there's a couple of buffalo</v>
<v Speaker 2>right on,</v>

892
00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:40.770
<v Speaker 2>right on the trail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the footpath.</v>

893
00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:42.390
<v Speaker 2>And we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

895
00:42:45.271 --> 00:42:46.450
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when we come down the hill,</v>

896
00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:47.970
<v Speaker 2>come around this big boulder and sure</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my uncle had a farm.</v>

00:42:51.871 --> 00:42:53.850
<v Speaker 2>He had cows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never been around a damn buffalo.</v>

00:42:53.851 --> 00:42:56.970
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the difference in suddenly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well they'll move.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>buddy.</v>

903
00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:04.620
<v Speaker 2>He jumps up on a rock and he's just</v>
<v Speaker 2>laughing at me like a dumb ass because</v>

904
00:43:04.621 --> 00:43:07.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm standing there at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this thing is 15 feet in front of God</v>

<v Speaker 2>hip towards me and he's just eaten.</v>

906
00:43:12.601 --> 00:43:15.000
<v Speaker 2>And finally he looks up and turns his</v>
<v Speaker 2>head and looked at me,</v>

907
00:43:15.001 --> 00:43:16.830
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I realized,</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's a water buffalo animals school.</v>

914
00:43:35.570 --> 00:43:37.290

<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

920
00:43:44.790 --> 00:43:49.140
<v Speaker 2>That thing took one more step forward</v>
<v Speaker 2>towards him.</v>

921
00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:51.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what else to do because</v>

<v Speaker 2>like he's going to charge me.</v>

924
00:43:55.111 --> 00:43:57.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm either running or what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I took one more step.</v>

925
00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:01.350
<v Speaker 2>And you just kinda like often and him</v>
<v Speaker 2>and his buddy ran,</v>

926
00:44:01.351 --> 00:44:05.220
<v Speaker 2>but when he started running me like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole ground shook and I remember</v>

927
00:44:05.221 --> 00:44:07.500
<v Speaker 2>standing there looking at my friend</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking like,</v>

928
00:44:07.501 --> 00:44:09.790
<v Speaker 2>that could've been really bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

929
00:44:09.810 --> 00:44:11.870
<v Speaker 2>you could be dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No stairs steps.</v>

930
00:44:11.910 --> 00:44:14.490
<v Speaker 2>But there's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's open to the public and out</v>

931
00:44:14.510 --> 00:44:15.990
<v Speaker 2>there all the time is buffalo</v>
<v Speaker 2>everywhere.</v>

932
00:44:15.991 --> 00:44:18.600
<v Speaker 2>So that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How's that a winning combination?</v>

933
00:44:18.690 --> 00:44:21.540
<v Speaker 2>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

934
00:44:21.541 --> 00:44:24.450
<v Speaker 2>I like it way better than I liked the</v>
<v Speaker 2>idea of a zinsser nature.</v>

935
00:44:24.451 --> 00:44:26.970
<v Speaker 2>At your own risk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you should enter nature at your</v>

936
00:44:26.971 --> 00:44:29.040
<v Speaker 2>own risk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think nature should be natural.</v>

937
00:44:29.070 --> 00:44:30.180
<v Speaker 2>You're a big bow hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

938
00:44:30.270 --> 00:44:31.103
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

939
00:44:31.890 --> 00:44:32.280
<v Speaker 2>We'd</v>

940
00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:35.110
<v Speaker 4>started to talk was a dinner,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I moved.</v>

941
00:44:35.130 --> 00:44:36.910
<v Speaker 4>Remain his shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

942
00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:40.230
<v Speaker 4>you shoot an Arrow and an elks ass and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't kill it.</v>

943
00:44:40.231 --> 00:44:43.260
<v Speaker 4>You just piss it off and now you're 40</v>
<v Speaker 4>yards away from this thing.</v>

944
00:44:43.261 --> 00:44:44.610
<v Speaker 4>What do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

945
00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:48.480
<v Speaker 4>most importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got to practice like before,</v>

946
00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:49.980
<v Speaker 4>especially if you're gonna shoot an</v>
<v Speaker 4>Arrow,</v>

947
00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:52.020
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I practice every day.</v>

948
00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:53.470
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Every day,</v>

949
00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:55.820
<v Speaker 4>every day I go somewhere and I shoot</v>
<v Speaker 4>arrows.</v>

950
00:44:55.870 --> 00:44:57.630
<v Speaker 4>Something you should probably take</v>
<v Speaker 4>seriously,</v>

951
00:44:57.660 --> 00:45:00.540
<v Speaker 4>you've got to take it so it's not like a</v>
<v Speaker 4>rifle thing.</v>

952
00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:02.280
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See a rifle thing is,</v>

953
00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:07.020
<v Speaker 4>it's all just about understanding how to</v>
<v Speaker 4>use the scope and understanding trigger</v>

954
00:45:07.021 --> 00:45:09.390
<v Speaker 4>discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got to understand how to squeeze the</v>

955
00:45:09.391 --> 00:45:14.391
<v Speaker 4>trigger and not pull it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but archery involves a lot of weird hand</v>

956
00:45:14.701 --> 00:45:18.240
<v Speaker 4>eye coordination and balance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's so many different factors going</v>

957
00:45:18.241 --> 00:45:19.980
<v Speaker 4>on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's like a little site that you have</v>

958
00:45:20.210 --> 00:45:24.000
<v Speaker 4>and you have to balance that site out</v>
<v Speaker 4>where the bubble is in the center.</v>

959
00:45:24.050 --> 00:45:26.460
<v Speaker 4>You know the level brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got to make sure that you're not</v>

960
00:45:26.461 --> 00:45:28.520
<v Speaker 4>torquing your go left or right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You gotta.</v>

961
00:45:28.521 --> 00:45:33.390
<v Speaker 4>Make sure that the peep peep site though</v>
<v Speaker 4>the the little string hold that you're</v>

962
00:45:33.391 --> 00:45:36.480
<v Speaker 4>looking through lines up and eclipses</v>
<v Speaker 4>perfectly.</v>

963
00:45:36.481 --> 00:45:39.150
<v Speaker 4>Your housing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to make sure that your hand is</v>

964
00:45:39.151 --> 00:45:42.240
<v Speaker 4>completely steady.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got to make sure you don't flinch at</v>

965
00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:45.210
<v Speaker 4>all when you release the arrow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's so much going on.</v>

966
00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:50.360
<v Speaker 4>Any micro movement can add up to several</v>
<v Speaker 4>feet left or right when it gets down</v>

967
00:45:51.391 --> 00:45:54.000
<v Speaker 4>past like 40 and fall.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was trying to control</v>

968
00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:57.090
<v Speaker 4>your attended.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

969
00:45:57.360 --> 00:45:59.890
<v Speaker 4>target on the moving creature.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

970
00:45:59.910 --> 00:46:03.810
<v Speaker 4>Moving creature and you have to make.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to be good enough to make an</v>

971
00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:05.220
<v Speaker 4>ethical shot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

972
00:46:05.420 --> 00:46:06.930
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to be good enough to,</v>

973
00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:11.040
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's not easy man.</v>

974
00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:12.180
<v Speaker 4>It's not fucking easy.</v>

975
00:46:12.330 --> 00:46:15.150
<v Speaker 4>So that's the most important thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like there's a lot of guys that</v>

976
00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:17.790
<v Speaker 4>shouldn't be doing it because they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing it.</v>

977
00:46:17.791 --> 00:46:21.870
<v Speaker 4>And I was gonna say all that said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when shit goes wrong in what you do.</v>

978
00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:25.320
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to have a plan,</v>

979
00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:26.341
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you,</v>

980
00:46:26.341 --> 00:46:29.790
<v Speaker 4>if you shoot an animal and a charge that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got to have a tree near you or</v>

981
00:46:29.791 --> 00:46:31.440
<v Speaker 4>something where you can get behind the</v>
<v Speaker 4>tree,</v>

982
00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:33.990
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you've got to assume that if you hit</v>

983
00:46:33.991 --> 00:46:36.810
<v Speaker 4>an animal with an Arrow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the last thing wants to do is charge</v>

984
00:46:36.811 --> 00:46:38.190
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Unless it's a predator.</v>

985
00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:41.130
<v Speaker 4>Predator's might charge you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you the real.</v>

986
00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:43.980
<v Speaker 4>There's a real possibility that if you</v>
<v Speaker 4>hit a bear,</v>

987
00:46:44.550 --> 00:46:46.230
<v Speaker 4>although I know people that have hit a</v>
<v Speaker 4>moose,</v>

988
00:46:47.610 --> 00:46:49.420
<v Speaker 4>my friend written Ella got run over by a</v>
<v Speaker 4>moose.</v>

989
00:46:49.421 --> 00:46:54.180
<v Speaker 4>He shot it with a rifle and went to move</v>
<v Speaker 4>in for the final shot of the thing was</v>

990
00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:58.230
<v Speaker 4>much better shape than he thought it was</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it got up and charged him and</v>

991
00:46:58.231 --> 00:46:59.064
<v Speaker 4>knocked him over.</v>

992
00:47:00.100 --> 00:47:03.990
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I seen another guy who shot a moose</v>

993
00:47:03.991 --> 00:47:08.430
<v Speaker 4>with a bow and the most charged them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but most of the time they want to get</v>

994
00:47:08.431 --> 00:47:10.500
<v Speaker 4>the fuck away from me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But again,</v>

995
00:47:11.250 --> 00:47:14.400
<v Speaker 4>it's not safe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not supposed to be,</v>

996
00:47:14.970 --> 00:47:16.830
<v Speaker 4>but it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

997
00:47:16.890 --> 00:47:20.820
<v Speaker 4>if you are hunting an elk and you kill</v>
<v Speaker 4>an elk with a bow and Arrow,</v>

998
00:47:20.821 --> 00:47:22.800
<v Speaker 4>you fucking killed an elk with a bow and</v>
<v Speaker 4>arrow.</v>

999
00:47:22.830 --> 00:47:24.860
<v Speaker 4>It is real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is 100 percent.</v>

1000
00:47:24.910 --> 00:47:27.810
<v Speaker 4>That is a real elk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a wild fucking animal that doesn't</v>

1001
00:47:27.811 --> 00:47:28.950
<v Speaker 4>have any rule book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no.</v>

1002
00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:31.690
<v Speaker 4>There is no act break.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no commercial time.</v>

1003
00:47:31.890 --> 00:47:35.200
<v Speaker 4>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a real 1000 pound wild horse with</v>

1004
00:47:35.201 --> 00:47:38.110
<v Speaker 4>a tree growing out of his fucking head</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's horny.</v>

1005
00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:39.400
<v Speaker 4>It's screaming.</v>

1006
00:47:42.340 --> 00:47:45.970
<v Speaker 4>This thing that's 10 times bigger than</v>
<v Speaker 4>you is running up a hill with a tree</v>

1007
00:47:45.971 --> 00:47:48.540
<v Speaker 4>grown out of his head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1008
00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:50.150
<v Speaker 4>you got to carry it out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1009
00:47:50.170 --> 00:47:51.770
<v Speaker 4>we got to cut it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1010
00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:53.830
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the out that I shot,</v>

1011
00:47:53.950 --> 00:47:56.260
<v Speaker 4>luckily we're close enough to get a</v>
<v Speaker 4>truck nearby.</v>

1012
00:47:56.530 --> 00:47:58.670
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know guys that have had the camp them</v>

1013
00:47:58.680 --> 00:47:59.740
<v Speaker 4>out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>packed them out.</v>

1014
00:48:00.690 --> 00:48:03.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because you know the smell and</v>

1015
00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:04.690
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're drawing predators at night if you</v>

1016
00:48:04.691 --> 00:48:07.030
<v Speaker 4>have to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's got to be real careful but</v>

<v Speaker 4>and they got it surrounded by wolves.</v>

1020
00:48:16.210 --> 00:48:17.590
<v Speaker 4>The wolves trying to take the elk.</v>

<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this alpha like hung around the edge of</v>

1026
00:48:33.001 --> 00:48:37.290
<v Speaker 4>this ridge and looked down at them and</v>
<v Speaker 4>just decided enough was enough and just</v>

1027
00:48:37.291 --> 00:48:39.390

<v Speaker 4>And they all disappeared the entire</v>

1028
00:48:39.391 --> 00:48:41.730
<v Speaker 4>pack.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But they were around him howling.</v>

<v Speaker 4>He said he'd get here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look 12 distinctly different howls</v>

<v Speaker 4>They kill a lot of wolves up their folks</v>

1035
00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:02.250
<v Speaker 4>and you might think that's terrible idea</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's horrible and it is</v>

1036
00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:05.970
<v Speaker 4>if you don't live there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you live there,</v>

<v Speaker 4>They have to like,</v>

1038
00:49:08.071 --> 00:49:11.460
<v Speaker 4>you don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody has this idea,</v>

1039
00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:13.320
<v Speaker 4>and I talk about this way too much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll stop,</v>

1040
00:49:13.590 --> 00:49:17.040
<v Speaker 4>but everybody had this idea of predators</v>
<v Speaker 4>to delete some character in a movie that</v>

1041
00:49:17.041 --> 00:49:19.960
<v Speaker 4>knows the script.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't man the,</v>

1042
00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:21.510
<v Speaker 4>the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to control their fucking</v>

1043
00:49:21.511 --> 00:49:26.010
<v Speaker 4>populations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just found 19 dead elk at these</v>

1044
00:49:26.011 --> 00:49:28.470
<v Speaker 4>wolves killed in Wyoming.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just left them there.</v>

1045
00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:33.090
<v Speaker 4>They just want our slaughter fest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They snuck into this pack of like some</v>

1046
00:49:33.091 --> 00:49:37.170
<v Speaker 4>of those elpacs in Wyoming.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'll get like a hundred elk now.</v>

1047
00:49:37.180 --> 00:49:39.270
<v Speaker 4>They're in its immense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These huge,</v>

1048
00:49:39.271 --> 00:49:41.760
<v Speaker 4>huge packs of elk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What'd you call it?</v>

1049
00:49:41.790 --> 00:49:43.110
<v Speaker 4>What would you call my herd?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Herd of elk.</v>

1050
00:49:43.470 --> 00:49:46.470
<v Speaker 4>And so this wolf pack jumped in there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at,</v>

1051
00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:50.760
<v Speaker 4>look at all the elk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They killed 19 elk and they didn't need</v>

1052
00:49:50.761 --> 00:49:52.500
<v Speaker 4>any of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These kills killed them.</v>

1053
00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:53.633
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1054
00:49:55.610 --> 00:49:56.830
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1055
00:49:57.110 --> 00:49:58.400
<v Speaker 4>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unless you live there,</v>

1056
00:49:58.401 --> 00:50:00.200
<v Speaker 4>it's hard to have an opinion one way or</v>
<v Speaker 4>another.</v>

1057
00:50:00.590 --> 00:50:03.700
<v Speaker 4>Everybody that has an opinion and it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>all.</v>

1058
00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:05.870
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people that have unrealistic opinions</v>

1059
00:50:05.871 --> 00:50:08.360
<v Speaker 4>about wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Zoll coming from a beautiful place.</v>

1060
00:50:08.450 --> 00:50:10.940
<v Speaker 4>It's coming from a place of light.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They love animals.</v>

1061
00:50:11.220 --> 00:50:13.380
<v Speaker 4>They do breed dogs and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they do.</v>

1062
00:50:13.580 --> 00:50:14.391
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have letters,</v>

1063
00:50:14.391 --> 00:50:15.920
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nothing's hunting them.</v>

1064
00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:17.870
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People are going with the Alphas.</v>

1065
00:50:17.871 --> 00:50:20.780
<v Speaker 4>Good to breed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He better fucking read up on history.</v>

1066
00:50:21.050 --> 00:50:22.430
<v Speaker 4>Natural his desk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not True.</v>

1067
00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:24.980
<v Speaker 4>They feel fuck dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck like crazy.</v>

1068
00:50:24.981 --> 00:50:27.560
<v Speaker 4>The alphas control most of the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1069
00:50:27.770 --> 00:50:28.160
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't</v>

1070
00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:29.240
<v Speaker 3>mean the other ones don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

1071
00:50:29.570 --> 00:50:31.070
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of bulbs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have.</v>

1072
00:50:31.130 --> 00:50:35.810
<v Speaker 3>They just did some recent survey on</v>
<v Speaker 3>wolves in a,</v>

1073
00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:39.650
<v Speaker 3>I believe it was Idaho and they were</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about how many of them there are</v>

1074
00:50:39.990 --> 00:50:40.820
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>

1075
00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:43.940
<v Speaker 3>Like this is kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're far beyond where they thought</v>

1076
00:50:43.941 --> 00:50:46.730
<v Speaker 3>that they needed to be before they would</v>
<v Speaker 3>put them back on the hunting list,</v>

1077
00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:49.850
<v Speaker 3>but they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't ever want to put them on.</v>

1078
00:50:50.030 --> 00:50:54.200
<v Speaker 3>Like what happens is they reintroduced</v>
<v Speaker 3>them in the nineties and before that</v>

1079
00:50:54.201 --> 00:50:57.110
<v Speaker 3>they were pretty much wiped out by</v>
<v Speaker 3>cattle ranchers and all these people</v>

1080
00:50:57.111 --> 00:51:00.730
<v Speaker 3>throughout the west.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's very few like wild wolves and</v>

1081
00:51:00.731 --> 00:51:03.950
<v Speaker 3>North America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they reintroduced these wolves</v>

1082
00:51:03.951 --> 00:51:07.310
<v Speaker 3>from Canada that happened to be larger</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way.</v>

1083
00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:13.220
<v Speaker 3>They're larger wolves and the wolves</v>
<v Speaker 3>that were naturally here.</v>

1084
00:51:13.250 --> 00:51:15.980
<v Speaker 3>What did the native Americans do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Both the wolf population.</v>

1085
00:51:16.820 --> 00:51:18.080
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1086
00:51:18.081 --> 00:51:19.220
<v Speaker 3>they didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They mean they,</v>

1087
00:51:19.250 --> 00:51:22.970
<v Speaker 3>they killed them certainly because they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they used to use their skin's a sneak up</v>

1088
00:51:22.971 --> 00:51:26.840
<v Speaker 3>on bison actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's a crazy fucking famous painting</v>

1089
00:51:26.841 --> 00:51:30.710
<v Speaker 3>and iconic iconic painting of these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1090
00:51:30.770 --> 00:51:35.770
<v Speaker 3>American Indians with a wolf costume on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they have a covering their body and</v>

1091
00:51:37.101 --> 00:51:41.690
<v Speaker 3>they're crawling with a bow and Arrow up</v>
<v Speaker 3>to these bison because bison weren't</v>

1092
00:51:41.691 --> 00:51:46.691
<v Speaker 3>scared of wolves really hardcore shaking</v>
<v Speaker 3>your head seriously.</v>

1093
00:51:47.830 --> 00:51:48.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bisons don't.</v>

1094
00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:50.930
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the reasons why there were</v>
<v Speaker 3>so many of them.</v>

1095
00:51:50.970 --> 00:51:54.350
<v Speaker 3>No other animals really had a very</v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult time taking them out.</v>

1096
00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:55.760
<v Speaker 3>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's the picture.</v>

1097
00:51:55.970 --> 00:51:58.340
<v Speaker 3>That's like an icon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly how it went and looked at</v>

1098
00:51:58.341 --> 00:51:59.174
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or is there</v>

1099
00:52:00.710 --> 00:52:03.830
<v Speaker 3>going to be bone chilling?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How did that feel?</v>

1100
00:52:03.831 --> 00:52:05.900
<v Speaker 3>Like staring that thing down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1101
00:52:06.770 --> 00:52:08.790
<v Speaker 3>I froze.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I literally froze because I just</v>

1102
00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:09.860
<v Speaker 3>started.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't know what to do.</v>

1103
00:52:09.950 --> 00:52:12.710
<v Speaker 3>Could be the end of your themes you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>standing relating to realize I'm,</v>

1104
00:52:12.770 --> 00:52:16.310
<v Speaker 3>I've just put myself on a horrendously</v>
<v Speaker 3>bad situation.</v>

1105
00:52:17.270 --> 00:52:19.850
<v Speaker 3>The amount of force they could generate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't even resist it.</v>

1106
00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:22.700
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing you could do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're just completely helpless.</v>

1107
00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:24.290
<v Speaker 3>Like there's literally nothing you could</v>
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

1108
00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:27.710
<v Speaker 3>They run faster than you and there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1109
00:52:27.740 --> 00:52:31.190
<v Speaker 3>that's a 1500 to 2000 pound animal.</v>

1110
00:52:35.260 --> 00:52:37.610
<v Speaker 3>The Indians snuck up on him like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

1111
00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:40.220
<v Speaker 3>my friend Steve Rinella and not Steven</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rinella,</v>

1112
00:52:40.221 --> 00:52:43.460
<v Speaker 3>remy warrant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has this television show called Apex</v>

1113
00:52:43.460 --> 00:52:45.090
<v Speaker 3>Predator.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

1114
00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:49.550
<v Speaker 3>they did all these different episodes on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ways different animals hunt their</v>

1115
00:52:49.551 --> 00:52:52.950
<v Speaker 3>prey and see if he could recreate it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's one of the things that he</v>

1116
00:52:52.951 --> 00:52:55.910
<v Speaker 3>did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He took a wolf skin and put it on him</v>

1117
00:52:56.340 --> 00:52:59.720
<v Speaker 3>and crawled up to these buffalo and got</v>
<v Speaker 3>like right inside them.</v>

1118
00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:03.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're afraid of us.</v>

1119
00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:05.480
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're afraid of people because of bang</v>

1120
00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:07.100
<v Speaker 3>sticks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>True to the.</v>

1121
00:53:07.940 --> 00:53:10.280
<v Speaker 3>I was saying earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forgot what I was talking about for a</v>

1122
00:53:10.281 --> 00:53:12.920
<v Speaker 3>second,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a friend of mine as a guide in</v>

1123
00:53:12.921 --> 00:53:17.240
<v Speaker 3>Colorado and they found these mountain</v>
<v Speaker 3>lion tracks like all these mountain lion</v>

1124
00:53:17.241 --> 00:53:22.010
<v Speaker 3>tracks and then elk tracks and then the</v>
<v Speaker 3>mountain lion tracks and the elk tracks</v>

1125
00:53:22.011 --> 00:53:26.700
<v Speaker 3>together and then there's a space of</v>
<v Speaker 3>like several hundred yards,</v>

1126
00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:31.380
<v Speaker 1>whether it was just elk tracks and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>they followed that elk track and they</v>

1127
00:53:31.381 --> 00:53:34.530
<v Speaker 1>found a mountain lion on top of the elk</v>
<v Speaker 1>killing it.</v>

1128
00:53:35.700 --> 00:53:39.630
<v Speaker 1>His fucking giant elk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like thousand pound elk.</v>

1129
00:53:39.631 --> 00:53:43.230
<v Speaker 1>He said it was a huge six by six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're talking about it in a mature</v>

1130
00:53:43.231 --> 00:53:45.750
<v Speaker 1>animal and this mountain lion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1131
00:53:45.751 --> 00:53:47.370
<v Speaker 1>fuck it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going for it.</v>

1132
00:53:47.850 --> 00:53:51.270
<v Speaker 1>And he jumped on this thing and clamped</v>
<v Speaker 1>a whole of its back and then brought it</v>

1133
00:53:51.271 --> 00:53:52.980
<v Speaker 1>down the mountain line weight 150</v>
<v Speaker 1>pounds.</v>

1134
00:53:53.460 --> 00:53:58.070
<v Speaker 1>So it took out this thousand plus pound</v>
<v Speaker 1>elk by jumping on his back and biting</v>

1135
00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:00.590
<v Speaker 1>its neck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys get them down in the valley and</v>

1136
00:54:00.630 --> 00:54:01.463
<v Speaker 1>allies?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1137
00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:05.190
<v Speaker 1>Encroaching killed a Koala bear at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>zoo the other day.</v>

1138
00:54:07.470 --> 00:54:09.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now are taking it seriously.</v>

1139
00:54:11.130 --> 00:54:12.780
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the fuck did it get in?</v>

1140
00:54:13.330 --> 00:54:16.470
<v Speaker 1>It's got a 12 foot high fence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's razor wire on the top panel.</v>

1141
00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:17.780
<v Speaker 1>Sneaky as cat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1142
00:54:17.810 --> 00:54:19.600
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so that little fucker that you</v>

1143
00:54:19.610 --> 00:54:20.690
<v Speaker 1>walk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was like [inaudible].</v>

1144
00:54:21.390 --> 00:54:24.600
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he climbed over barbed wire.</v>

1145
00:54:24.900 --> 00:54:25.800
<v Speaker 1>That's hardcore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

1146
00:54:25.830 --> 00:54:28.020
<v Speaker 1>That's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As fucking court gets</v>

1147
00:54:30.090 --> 00:54:33.180
<v Speaker 1>12 foot high fence barbed wire at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>top was like,</v>

1148
00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:34.440
<v Speaker 1>hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good try.</v>

1149
00:54:35.010 --> 00:54:37.830
<v Speaker 1>Good try.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He probably got caught up a bit,</v>

1150
00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:40.680
<v Speaker 1>but whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a mountain lion.</v>

<v Speaker 1>fucker.</v>

1159

<v Speaker 1>Hollywood hills.</v>

1160
00:55:04.980 --> 00:55:06.930
<v Speaker 1>That's the one that they think killed</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Koala bear.</v>

1161
00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:09.180
<v Speaker 1>That's a lion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lion.</v>

1162
00:55:09.300 --> 00:55:11.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like a lion in Africa.</v>

1163
00:55:11.101 --> 00:55:13.380
<v Speaker 1>Lion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look the fucking forearms on that.</v>

1164
00:55:14.290 --> 00:55:17.550
<v Speaker 1>Like those forums.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be awful.</v>

1165
00:55:17.610 --> 00:55:19.950
<v Speaker 1>That isn't Stetson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Insane amount of power.</v>

1166
00:55:19.951 --> 00:55:23.170
<v Speaker 1>That thing was have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they say that pound for pound.</v>

1167
00:55:23.171 --> 00:55:28.171
<v Speaker 1>They're one of the strongest cats on my</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoulders and arms.</v>

1168
00:55:28.561 --> 00:55:30.690
<v Speaker 1>My Gut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you right now for Bobcat,</v>

1169
00:55:30.691 --> 00:55:32.610
<v Speaker 1>tries to fuck with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll fuck up a bobcat.</v>

1170
00:55:33.030 --> 00:55:35.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty confident I'll kick a bobcat's</v>

1171
00:55:35.941 --> 00:55:39.630
<v Speaker 1>ass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it still wouldn't be fun.</v>

1172
00:55:40.790 --> 00:55:41.730
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm kidding man.</v>

1173
00:55:42.100 --> 00:55:44.400
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have cats and I have to wash them.</v>

1174
00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:45.720
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

1175
00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:47.880
<v Speaker 1>my daughter is allergic to cats and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way we,</v>

1176
00:55:47.910 --> 00:55:50.010
<v Speaker 1>the only way we communicate is we have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to shave them.</v>

1177
00:55:50.310 --> 00:55:53.790
<v Speaker 1>So they get a buzz cut like a lion's cut</v>
<v Speaker 1>and washed them.</v>

1178
00:55:53.791 --> 00:55:56.190
<v Speaker 1>And it makes a giant difference in how</v>
<v Speaker 1>much damage are they leave.</v>

1179
00:55:56.250 --> 00:55:58.620
<v Speaker 1>They leave because they're both like</v>
<v Speaker 1>really fluffy cats.</v>

1180
00:55:58.790 --> 00:56:02.760
<v Speaker 1>They would leave cat hair everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so this solution made a bit,</v>

1181
00:56:02.761 --> 00:56:05.220
<v Speaker 1>but I have to fucking hold onto these</v>
<v Speaker 1>little fuckers,</v>

1182
00:56:05.370 --> 00:56:09.840
<v Speaker 1>why they get shaved and man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though like they love me and that,</v>

1183
00:56:09.880 --> 00:56:11.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they want to go man,</v>

1184
00:56:11.821 --> 00:56:16.170
<v Speaker 1>they want to go and you realize like how</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult they are to controls Agila</v>

1185
00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:18.380
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That fucking boot.</v>

1186
00:56:18.390 --> 00:56:22.080
<v Speaker 1>They twist and contort fucking to kick</v>
<v Speaker 1>it off yet.</v>

1187
00:56:22.081 --> 00:56:24.250
<v Speaker 1>And it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this big long sinewy</v>

1188
00:56:24.250 --> 00:56:26.020
<v Speaker 3>relaxed muscles that all of a sudden</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

1191
00:56:30.611 --> 00:56:35.060

<v Speaker 3>But with a mountain lion as a Bobcat,</v>

1204
00:56:58.800 --> 00:57:03.340
<v Speaker 3>They look like a star wars cat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called a lynx lynx and they have</v>

1205
00:57:03.341 --> 00:57:05.970
<v Speaker 3>these crazy big paws with [inaudible]</v>
<v Speaker 3>serious.</v>

00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:12.671
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1210
00:57:12.671 --> 00:57:15.310

<v Speaker 3>That looks real.</v>

1212
00:57:16.780 --> 00:57:19.360
<v Speaker 3>That looks like something from some</v>
<v Speaker 3>weird movie.</v>

1213
00:57:19.510 --> 00:57:23.260
<v Speaker 3>Like the proportions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go back to Jamie.</v>

1214
00:57:23.530 --> 00:57:26.470
<v Speaker 3>They'll get the proportions of its body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so odd.</v>

1215
00:57:26.950 --> 00:57:31.540
<v Speaker 3>Giant feet long as big legs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just so weird.</v>

1216
00:57:31.541 --> 00:57:36.370
<v Speaker 3>Body man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that thing is just up there earning</v>

1217
00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:40.780
<v Speaker 3>just earning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just out there hustling everyday jacket</v>

1218
00:57:40.781 --> 00:57:43.390
<v Speaker 3>shit with its face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what does it hunt and Canada I</v>

1219
00:57:43.391 --> 00:57:44.940
<v Speaker 3>guess everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure.</v>

1220
00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:46.960
<v Speaker 3>Small things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they get that big.</v>

1221
00:57:47.260 --> 00:57:49.600
<v Speaker 3>I mean if I had to guess,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say links probably only gets to</v>

1222
00:57:49.601 --> 00:57:52.900
<v Speaker 3>be like 50 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See what it see how big they get.</v>

1223
00:57:53.150 --> 00:57:55.180
<v Speaker 3>See if I'm right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they get much bigger than</v>

1224
00:57:55.181 --> 00:57:56.150
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think they,</v>

1225
00:57:56.360 --> 00:57:57.310
<v Speaker 3>they probably eat.</v>

1226
00:57:57.390 --> 00:58:01.000
<v Speaker 3>I'm 24 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1227
00:58:01.570 --> 00:58:06.040
<v Speaker 3>I think they probably eat like rabbits</v>
<v Speaker 3>and squirrels or Fonz.</v>

1228
00:58:06.041 --> 00:58:10.750
<v Speaker 3>They'll definitely eat fonz.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We found this fucked up video of this</v>

1229
00:58:10.751 --> 00:58:11.680
<v Speaker 3>Martin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1230
00:58:11.681 --> 00:58:13.420
<v Speaker 3>Martin chasing a rabbit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1231
00:58:13.421 --> 00:58:15.900
<v Speaker 3>what a Martin is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was the play it for him?</v>

1232
00:58:15.901 --> 00:58:18.940
<v Speaker 3>Jamie Martin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Martin is an animal that I always</v>

1233
00:58:18.941 --> 00:58:21.940
<v Speaker 3>associated with for because of those</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alaska shows,</v>

1234
00:58:21.980 --> 00:58:23.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those shows where the dudes are living</v>

1235
00:58:23.501 --> 00:58:26.380
<v Speaker 3>up in Alaska.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's one called mountain men and this</v>

1236
00:58:26.381 --> 00:58:30.940
<v Speaker 3>guy runs a food trap line and one of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>things that he trapped is Martin Martin.</v>

1237
00:58:31.090 --> 00:58:34.000
<v Speaker 3>It's like a little badger and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>chasing after a rabbit.</v>

1238
00:58:34.660 --> 00:58:39.260
<v Speaker 3>So the little black thing and the back</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the PA is the Martin and this is a</v>

1239
00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:42.910
<v Speaker 3>literally a run for life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at this rabbit is going fuck,</v>

1240
00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:45.120
<v Speaker 3>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the Martins hustling behind him.</v>

1241
00:58:45.170 --> 00:58:47.080
<v Speaker 3>He was moving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck you at is.</v>

1242
00:58:47.230 --> 00:58:51.220
<v Speaker 3>And this is like a crazy sprint.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they're both sprinting.</v>

1243
00:58:51.370 --> 00:58:55.630
<v Speaker 3>It's like how long can they do it for?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the Martin just is relentless and</v>

1244
00:58:55.631 --> 00:58:57.640
<v Speaker 3>these people are filming this for their</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking car.</v>

1245
00:58:57.641 --> 00:59:01.580
<v Speaker 3>Following them behind them on the road.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1246
00:59:01.630 --> 00:59:05.830
<v Speaker 3>the Martin just finally the rabbit</v>
<v Speaker 3>starts trying to veer off the road and</v>

1247
00:59:05.831 --> 00:59:09.700
<v Speaker 3>he gets into the sick shit and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Martin closes the distance.</v>

1248
00:59:10.030 --> 00:59:14.230
<v Speaker 3>But look at the drama here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It runs better on the Hong Bitch.</v>

1249
00:59:14.790 --> 00:59:16.710
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1250
00:59:16.900 --> 00:59:19.060
<v Speaker 3>And what's crazy is they're the same</v>
<v Speaker 3>size.</v>

1251
00:59:19.210 --> 00:59:20.950
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Martin is smaller.</v>

1252
00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:23.810
<v Speaker 3>The rabbit look at the difference things</v>
<v Speaker 3>mean as shit.</v>

1253
00:59:23.900 --> 00:59:26.300
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he just carried it up by its</v>

1254
00:59:26.301 --> 00:59:27.820
<v Speaker 3>face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's jumping.</v>

1255
00:59:28.100 --> 00:59:28.933
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

1256
00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:31.250
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he hit a nitro button or something,</v>

1257
00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:33.140
<v Speaker 3>but he knew the end was near.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was cool.</v>

1258
00:59:33.860 --> 00:59:36.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if you are download rabbit hole</v>

1259
00:59:36.831 --> 00:59:40.040
<v Speaker 3>on this thought with a dude to the death</v>
<v Speaker 3>with your faces,</v>

1260
00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:41.240
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're good.</v>

1261
00:59:41.330 --> 00:59:46.330
<v Speaker 3>You killed them with your face and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>dragged him up a hill with your face all</v>

1262
00:59:46.671 --> 00:59:50.480
<v Speaker 3>in the course of 15 seconds from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>time that Martin got ahold of that</v>

1263
00:59:50.481 --> 00:59:52.400
<v Speaker 3>rabbit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that rabbit is dead as fuck.</v>

1264
00:59:52.550 --> 00:59:56.030
<v Speaker 3>And he was carrying away in 15 seconds</v>
<v Speaker 3>with this phase.</v>

1265
01:00:00.350 --> 01:00:05.350

<v Speaker 2>I just have to get up and try to sing in</v>

1269
01:00:15.231 --> 01:00:20.180
<v Speaker 2>pitch ever to make money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said the worst thing he ever told me</v>

1270
01:00:20.690 --> 01:00:25.690
<v Speaker 2>was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a guy who was driving along on</v>

1271
01:00:26.211 --> 01:00:28.040
<v Speaker 2>his way to work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One morning he hit a deer,</v>

1272
01:00:28.430 --> 01:00:32.060
<v Speaker 2>the deer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the body split in half and the ass end</v>

1273
01:00:32.061 --> 01:00:34.340
<v Speaker 2>of the deer came up over the hood and</v>
<v Speaker 2>through his windshield.</v>

1274
01:00:34.341 --> 01:00:37.340
<v Speaker 2>And I was just intestines and blood and</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit and guts everywhere.</v>

1275
01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:39.950
<v Speaker 2>All literally like the glass room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she'll cut his face all up.</v>

1276
01:00:39.951 --> 01:00:43.440
<v Speaker 2>So now he's got all this shit down in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the blood and in his face.</v>

<v Speaker 2>went through the windshield and laid</v>

1279
01:00:50.961 --> 01:00:54.650
<v Speaker 2>down in this creek bed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like after he hits the deer and lay</v>

01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:35.531
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1380
01:05:35.531 --> 01:05:37.870
<v Speaker 1>I say it looks like Christmas tree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean like a little one that's on</v>

1381
01:05:37.871 --> 01:05:40.240
<v Speaker 1>your tree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about several inch long.</v>

1382
01:05:40.241 --> 01:05:42.610
<v Speaker 1>Light Bulb was stuffed up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This dude's ass.</v>

1383
01:05:43.570 --> 01:05:44.620
<v Speaker 1>People get bored,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1384
01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:45.291
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he.</v>

1385
01:05:45.291 --> 01:05:46.540
<v Speaker 1>They found everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wine,</v>

1386
01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:47.770
<v Speaker 1>champagne,</v>
<v Speaker 1>corks,</v>

1387
01:05:49.300 --> 01:05:53.380
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of different objects like</v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee cups and stuff.</v>

1388
01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:56.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ever heard any stories like that?</v>

1389
01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:02.710
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's also probably correlates</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the cocaine days.</v>

1390
01:06:02.711 --> 01:06:04.780
<v Speaker 1>They're probably just sticking things in</v>
<v Speaker 1>every hole.</v>

1391
01:06:04.781 --> 01:06:09.250
<v Speaker 1>They had</v>
<v Speaker 1>hats off to anybody.</v>

1392
01:06:09.330 --> 01:06:13.450
<v Speaker 1>I can work a coffee because you and your</v>
<v Speaker 1>ass so that it was fun seeing all this</v>

1393
01:06:13.451 --> 01:06:14.720
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

1394
01:06:14.980 --> 01:06:19.980
<v Speaker 1>the different layers of society you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>dealing with on a day to day basis and</v>

1395
01:06:21.970 --> 01:06:26.970
<v Speaker 1>having to hold a any type of firm belief</v>
<v Speaker 1>in humanity or civilization.</v>

1396
01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:29.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where a person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

1397
01:06:30.130 --> 01:06:34.060
<v Speaker 4>even people that don't see violence like</v>
<v Speaker 4>people maybe that see just a lot of</v>

1398
01:06:34.061 --> 01:06:37.570
<v Speaker 4>accidents.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's got to be spooky.</v>

1399
01:06:39.010 --> 01:06:43.020
<v Speaker 4>They say that a lot of women who are</v>
<v Speaker 4>like emt,</v>

1400
01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:47.290
<v Speaker 4>I have a hard time settling down and</v>
<v Speaker 4>like having families,</v>

1401
01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:51.820
<v Speaker 4>like they get whacked out by it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like particularly that might be sexist</v>

1402
01:06:51.821 --> 01:06:55.900
<v Speaker 4>to say I don't think it is because uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's something that I've heard</v>

1403
01:06:56.230 --> 01:06:59.650
<v Speaker 4>female ain't emt talk about just their</v>
<v Speaker 4>own personal experiences,</v>

1404
01:07:00.070 --> 01:07:02.080
<v Speaker 4>but that it's so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so dark.</v>

1405
01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:05.920
<v Speaker 4>Like everyday you're seeing broken necks</v>
<v Speaker 4>and broken legs.</v>

1406
01:07:05.921 --> 01:07:09.200
<v Speaker 4>It's car accidents and people splattered</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the road and you know,</v>

1407
01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:13.120
<v Speaker 4>Uhm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because grueling after awhile.</v>

1408
01:07:13.270 --> 01:07:16.400
<v Speaker 1>So what's like ptsd numbers like</v>
<v Speaker 1>unprofessional,</v>

1409
01:07:16.420 --> 01:07:16.871
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1410
01:07:16.871 --> 01:07:18.350
<v Speaker 1>you got to be having some trauma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

1411
01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:20.530
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1412
01:07:20.930 --> 01:07:22.570
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a certain amount of stress that</v>

1413
01:07:22.571 --> 01:07:25.540
<v Speaker 4>I think comes with any kind of job where</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're looking at death a lot.</v>

1414
01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:28.780
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much ptsd does a doctor have?</v>

1415
01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:32.620
<v Speaker 4>Like emergency room doctors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much do they just get accustomed to</v>

1416
01:07:32.621 --> 01:07:35.830
<v Speaker 4>it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it takes a very special type of</v>

1417
01:07:35.831 --> 01:07:37.210
<v Speaker 4>personality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1418
01:07:37.211 --> 01:07:38.290
<v Speaker 4>I think it also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is,</v>

1419
01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:40.670
<v Speaker 4>does man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's really a lot like what we</v>

1420
01:07:40.671 --> 01:07:45.250
<v Speaker 4>were talking about when you're taking in</v>
<v Speaker 4>all these stories in the world because</v>

1421
01:07:45.550 --> 01:07:48.190
<v Speaker 4>you can manage your own life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're not.</v>

1422
01:07:48.220 --> 01:07:50.200
<v Speaker 4>You're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're paying attention to the news,</v>

1423
01:07:50.201 --> 01:07:53.770
<v Speaker 4>you're going to get inundated with</v>
<v Speaker 4>stories by the 7 billion people and it's</v>

1424
01:07:53.771 --> 01:07:56.230
<v Speaker 4>just too much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just too much data coming at you</v>

1425
01:07:56.231 --> 01:07:58.810
<v Speaker 4>and too much of it negative.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's probably the same way</v>

1426
01:07:58.811 --> 01:08:02.020
<v Speaker 4>with like an emergency room doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's okay if you see somebody get</v>

1427
01:08:02.021 --> 01:08:04.510
<v Speaker 4>hurt once in your life a few times in</v>
<v Speaker 4>your life or,</v>

1428
01:08:04.810 --> 01:08:06.010
<v Speaker 4>or maybe even,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1429
01:08:06.730 --> 01:08:09.320
<v Speaker 1>like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get desensitized.</v>

1430
01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:10.820
<v Speaker 1>They're not processing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

1431
01:08:10.821 --> 01:08:13.880
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's onto the next case.</v>

1432
01:08:14.300 --> 01:08:16.700
<v Speaker 1>You can definitely desensitized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't,</v>

1433
01:08:16.701 --> 01:08:18.920
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't freak you out anymore.</v>

1434
01:08:19.290 --> 01:08:22.660
<v Speaker 1>You see a guy whose leg is hanging off</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

1435
01:08:23.660 --> 01:08:26.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially guys who are taking care of</v>

1436
01:08:26.450 --> 01:08:27.700
<v Speaker 1>troops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1437
01:08:27.930 --> 01:08:30.140
<v Speaker 1>or emt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1438
01:08:30.380 --> 01:08:32.120
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People were shooting at you.</v>

1439
01:08:32.170 --> 01:08:32.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1440
01:08:32.950 --> 01:08:34.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried to carry them out while bullets</v>

1441
01:08:34.371 --> 01:08:37.730
<v Speaker 1>are flying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's insanity.</v>

1442
01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:41.200
<v Speaker 1>Again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just try to sing in key math and I</v>

1443
01:08:41.210 --> 01:08:43.850
<v Speaker 1>know</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got it easy.</v>

1444
01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:49.070
<v Speaker 1>It's just fascinating how many different</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways to be a person there are.</v>

1445
01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:52.310
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many different different kinds of</v>

1446
01:08:52.311 --> 01:08:56.480
<v Speaker 1>lives you can live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many different types of experiences</v>

1447
01:08:56.481 --> 01:09:00.860
<v Speaker 1>you can have and your reality could be</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much different than somebody else's</v>

1448
01:09:00.861 --> 01:09:04.430
<v Speaker 1>reality and you're convinced that your</v>
<v Speaker 1>reality is life and they're convinced</v>

1449
01:09:04.431 --> 01:09:05.270
<v Speaker 1>that there is life.</v>

1450
01:09:05.660 --> 01:09:06.890
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what we're talking about with the</v>

1451
01:09:06.891 --> 01:09:08.990
<v Speaker 1>wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like those people that live near those</v>

1452
01:09:09.050 --> 01:09:11.450
<v Speaker 1>things that are fucking shitting their</v>
<v Speaker 1>pants when they hear those howls at</v>

1453
01:09:11.451 --> 01:09:15.110
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My buddy lives in BC and his neighbor's</v>

1454
01:09:15.111 --> 01:09:17.960
<v Speaker 1>cow was taken out by wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While they're all watching,</v>

1455
01:09:19.250 --> 01:09:23.050
<v Speaker 1>they're all looking out the window</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to do.</v>

1456
01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:26.090
<v Speaker 1>Can't do shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can go out and start shooting for to</v>

1457
01:09:26.091 --> 01:09:29.360
<v Speaker 1>get full and fuck off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can go out and start shooting,</v>

1458
01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:32.580
<v Speaker 1>but it's dark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless you have pretty nice scope.</v>

1459
01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:34.680
<v Speaker 1>I could live up there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

1460
01:09:34.850 --> 01:09:37.520
<v Speaker 1>the winters I think would just be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>

1461
01:09:37.700 --> 01:09:40.610
<v Speaker 1>They're ruthless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but anywhere that's.</v>

1462
01:09:41.030 --> 01:09:43.280
<v Speaker 1>It's too nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get too many people.</v>

1463
01:09:43.730 --> 01:09:46.550
<v Speaker 1>Like we were talking about Los Angeles</v>
<v Speaker 1>is too perfect.</v>

1464
01:09:46.670 --> 01:09:50.600
<v Speaker 1>Everyday the weather's perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because of that you have to bring</v>

1465
01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:53.750
<v Speaker 1>carbon monoxide air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1466
01:09:53.910 --> 01:09:54.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a.</v>

1467
01:09:55.230 --> 01:09:56.660
<v Speaker 1>yesterday it was the first time I'd</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever,</v>

1468
01:09:58.340 --> 01:10:02.250
<v Speaker 1>at some point I think we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my family was ready for an adventure or</v>

1469
01:10:02.251 --> 01:10:03.410
<v Speaker 1>a relocation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

1470
01:10:03.411 --> 01:10:06.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that I could ever acclimate</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter how long I was here to</v>

1471
01:10:06.861 --> 01:10:11.861
<v Speaker 1>convincing myself that the traffic is</v>
<v Speaker 1>worth it,</v>

1472
01:10:11.990 --> 01:10:13.340
<v Speaker 1>worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't.</v>

1473
01:10:13.370 --> 01:10:14.570
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to live here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

1474
01:10:14.571 --> 01:10:17.270
<v Speaker 1>that's the beautiful thing about</v>
<v Speaker 1>southern California is you could live in</v>

1475
01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:19.480
<v Speaker 1>San Diego,</v>
<v Speaker 1>La Jolla,</v>

1476
01:10:19.740 --> 01:10:22.980
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is beautiful and quiet and fucking</v>

1477
01:10:23.170 --> 01:10:26.570
<v Speaker 1>picture ask.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see the ocean's right there.</v>

1478

<v Speaker 1>So pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the northern part of the state law</v>

1479
01:10:28.771 --> 01:10:33.771
<v Speaker 1>to northern part stays amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in Mendocino over by where the</v>

1480
01:10:35.241 --> 01:10:39.650
<v Speaker 1>ocean is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like three hours plus maybe four</v>

1481
01:10:39.651 --> 01:10:44.651
<v Speaker 1>hours north of San Francisco.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So pretty man soap or the redwood</v>

1482
01:10:45.171 --> 01:10:46.760
<v Speaker 1>forest.</v>

<v Speaker 3>But one of the</v>

1556
01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:15.430
<v Speaker 1>weird things about being a musician and</v>

<v Speaker 1>but you're also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're performing in front of all those</v>

1561
01:14:27.041 --> 01:14:27.874
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1564
01:14:32.811 --> 01:14:35.780
<v Speaker 2>when you write songs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess you can't ever stop to think,</v>

1565
01:14:35.781 --> 01:14:36.770
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:01.760
<v Speaker 1>It was a laundry list about</v>

<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

1577
01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:07.530
<v Speaker 2>my view on laundry lists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Experienced.</v>

1578
01:15:08.340 --> 01:15:10.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just such a great song though.</v>

1579
01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:13.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll dig that one back out.</v>

1580
01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:14.500
<v Speaker 2>It was Tom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tom to work it up,</v>

1581
01:15:14.501 --> 01:15:16.720
<v Speaker 2>I think in a new way and make it fresh</v>
<v Speaker 2>for us.</v>

1582
01:15:17.230 --> 01:15:17.931
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For me,</v>

1583
01:15:17.931 --> 01:15:21.550
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love the recording process most.</v>

1584
01:15:21.580 --> 01:15:22.850
<v Speaker 2>Most of all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

1585
01:15:22.900 --> 01:15:23.733
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1586
01:15:24.490 --> 01:15:26.140
<v Speaker 2>that's where you learn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you've improved,</v>

1587
01:15:26.170 --> 01:15:27.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're under a microscope,</v>

1588
01:15:27.700 --> 01:15:32.700
<v Speaker 2>a get hyperfocused in the studio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a good thing.</v>

1589
01:15:33.281 --> 01:15:36.460
<v Speaker 2>Other people get tired or I'd probably</v>
<v Speaker 2>just keep them in there all day,</v>

1590
01:15:36.461 --> 01:15:38.410
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

1591
01:15:38.770 --> 01:15:41.410
<v Speaker 2>but it's almost like you're so tied to</v>
<v Speaker 2>this thing in,</v>

1592
01:15:41.411 --> 01:15:45.760
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in it that by the time it's finished you</v>

1593
01:15:45.761 --> 01:15:47.200
<v Speaker 2>just don't even want to think about it</v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

1594
01:15:47.201 --> 01:15:48.070
<v Speaker 2>You want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gets like,</v>

1595
01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:49.000
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's done,</v>

1596
01:15:49.530 --> 01:15:50.201
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1597
01:15:50.201 --> 01:15:52.860
<v Speaker 2>but now you got to work it up and go out</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a live context and,</v>

1598
01:15:52.910 --> 01:15:55.480
<v Speaker 2>and play this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas hopefully you've,</v>

1599
01:15:55.540 --> 01:15:58.760
<v Speaker 2>you've tried to bare your soul and be as</v>
<v Speaker 2>honest as possible,</v>

1600
01:15:58.761 --> 01:16:02.350
<v Speaker 2>but then you're standing in front of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>room every night so you have to block</v>

1601
01:16:02.351 --> 01:16:04.480
<v Speaker 2>that part of it out of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of your head that like people are</v>

1602
01:16:04.481 --> 01:16:06.610
<v Speaker 2>judging you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1603
01:16:07.780 --> 01:16:10.450
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's also part of it too,</v>

1604
01:16:10.451 --> 01:16:12.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're living that life experience out</v>

1605
01:16:12.791 --> 01:16:16.730
<v Speaker 2>in real time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's all been really educational and</v>

1606
01:16:16.810 --> 01:16:21.810
<v Speaker 2>new for me in terms of figuring out how</v>
<v Speaker 2>to navigate that is artistic away as</v>

1607
01:16:22.781 --> 01:16:27.781
<v Speaker 2>possible without</v>
<v Speaker 2>compromising anything.</v>

1608
01:16:27.911 --> 01:16:28.744
<v Speaker 2>I guess</v>

1609
01:16:28.870 --> 01:16:31.000
<v Speaker 1>I think we all learned from each other</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that way.</v>

1610
01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:32.770
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got to sell.</v>

1611
01:16:32.820 --> 01:16:34.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you going get to do it anymore?</v>

1612
01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:39.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't you learn from other musicians in</v>

1613
01:16:39.671 --> 01:16:41.800
<v Speaker 1>that way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you see like how other guys are</v>

1614
01:16:41.801 --> 01:16:43.760
<v Speaker 1>handling it or how they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1615
01:16:44.230 --> 01:16:45.970
<v Speaker 1>how it influences their creative</v>
<v Speaker 1>process?</v>

1616
01:16:45.971 --> 01:16:47.350
<v Speaker 1>Does it influence you?</v>

1617
01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:51.950
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you definitely noticed traits in</v>

1618
01:16:51.951 --> 01:16:55.810
<v Speaker 2>other people that you wish you had more</v>
<v Speaker 2>of or that you could maybe adhere to and</v>

1619
01:16:55.811 --> 01:16:57.560
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's motivating and,</v>

1620
01:16:58.220 --> 01:16:59.053
<v Speaker 2>but like he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1621
01:16:59.060 --> 01:17:01.280
<v Speaker 2>it's just about trying to be a better</v>
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

1622
01:17:01.340 --> 01:17:02.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1623
01:17:02.930 --> 01:17:06.590
<v Speaker 2>and use whatever outlet this is in order</v>
<v Speaker 2>to hopefully make other people feel good</v>

1624
01:17:06.591 --> 01:17:08.180
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1625
01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:11.330
<v Speaker 2>or to deal with things that maybe they</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know how to express,</v>

1626
01:17:12.230 --> 01:17:14.960
<v Speaker 2>which for me I think is the most</v>
<v Speaker 2>important part of making music.</v>

1627
01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:18.440
<v Speaker 2>And so that's what it's always given me</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the past before I was a performer and</v>

1628
01:17:18.441 --> 01:17:21.440
<v Speaker 2>I just loved it from a sheer listeners</v>
<v Speaker 2>position,</v>

1629
01:17:21.441 --> 01:17:23.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>offers is a lot of comfort.</v>

1630
01:17:23.060 --> 01:17:26.570
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1631
01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:29.750
<v Speaker 2>people tell you this after the shows</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're making an impact on their</v>

1632
01:17:29.751 --> 01:17:31.580
<v Speaker 2>life and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>

1633
01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:34.220
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my buddy Jordan said that his friend,</v>

1634
01:17:35.150 --> 01:17:38.720
<v Speaker 2>her grandmother's land in her hospital</v>
<v Speaker 2>bed and the last thing she heard,</v>

1635
01:17:38.721 --> 01:17:40.350
<v Speaker 2>she played her one of my songs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1636
01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:41.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that song,</v>

1637
01:17:41.361 --> 01:17:43.070
<v Speaker 2>my voice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she just said,</v>

1638
01:17:43.071 --> 01:17:46.040
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got a really pretty voice and she's</v>

1639
01:17:46.041 --> 01:17:47.400
<v Speaker 2>like totally relaxed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1640
01:17:47.430 --> 01:17:52.430
<v Speaker 2>So you hear things like that and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's easy to get hung up on mechanics or</v>

1641
01:17:54.830 --> 01:17:57.680
<v Speaker 2>expectations or pressures or the</v>
<v Speaker 2>industry and all that.</v>

1642
01:17:57.681 --> 01:18:00.650
<v Speaker 2>But like it feels like if you just kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of stepped back and hit pause,</v>

1643
01:18:00.651 --> 01:18:05.651
<v Speaker 2>it's easy to remember that anybody doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>this job is very lucky to be able to do</v>

1644
01:18:06.081 --> 01:18:08.750
<v Speaker 2>this job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for me like,</v>

1645
01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:10.760
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think,</v>

1646
01:18:11.210 --> 01:18:15.530
<v Speaker 2>I think in a lot of ways the modern</v>
<v Speaker 2>media and industry have sorta not ruined</v>

1647
01:18:15.531 --> 01:18:18.800
<v Speaker 2>music,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's made it really hard for people</v>

1648
01:18:18.801 --> 01:18:20.510
<v Speaker 2>to focus on what is really about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1649
01:18:20.511 --> 01:18:23.510
<v Speaker 2>it's like life is all of a sudden one</v>
<v Speaker 2>big episode of the voice.</v>

1650
01:18:23.990 --> 01:18:28.420
<v Speaker 2>And it's all about the year end lists</v>
<v Speaker 2>and who says this is better than what?</v>

1651
01:18:28.421 --> 01:18:31.210
<v Speaker 2>And seen somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the artists better than somebody art and</v>

1652
01:18:31.220 --> 01:18:33.500
<v Speaker 2>I just don't think that that's ever like</v>
<v Speaker 2>a healthy thing,</v>

1653
01:18:34.550 --> 01:18:36.800
<v Speaker 2>if that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Making a competition out of something</v>

1654
01:18:36.801 --> 01:18:38.870
<v Speaker 2>that's supposed to make everybody feel</v>
<v Speaker 2>included.</v>

1655
01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:43.430
<v Speaker 1>Well it's definitely contrary to what</v>
<v Speaker 1>seems to be your primary focus,</v>

1656
01:18:43.431 --> 01:18:46.580
<v Speaker 1>which is making the best music for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for your expression.</v>

1657
01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:48.860
<v Speaker 1>D,</v>
<v Speaker 1>expressing yourself in the best way you</v>

1658
01:18:48.861 --> 01:18:51.830
<v Speaker 1>can and making something that's going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>impact people in a,</v>

1659
01:18:51.831 --> 01:18:54.190
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a way where your thoughts are going</v>

1660
01:18:54.191 --> 01:18:56.060
<v Speaker 1>to get across,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be moved by it.</v>

1661
01:18:56.510 --> 01:18:59.270
<v Speaker 1>You can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're thinking about winning awards,</v>

1662
01:18:59.310 --> 01:19:04.310
<v Speaker 1>a contract selling lots of or selling or</v>
<v Speaker 1>any of those things like promoting it</v>

1663
01:19:04.311 --> 01:19:05.470
<v Speaker 1>business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1664
01:19:05.471 --> 01:19:09.710
<v Speaker 1>like anytime you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you not to say that it's impossible.</v>

1665
01:19:09.770 --> 01:19:12.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean there is there it's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like some people do sell a lot of</v>

1666
01:19:12.981 --> 01:19:14.750
<v Speaker 1>records.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Impacting people's lives with great</v>

1667
01:19:14.751 --> 01:19:16.890
<v Speaker 1>music is out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Music sells.</v>

1668
01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:17.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Period.</v>

1669
01:19:17.881 --> 01:19:20.810
<v Speaker 1>It always finds a way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's going to sell whether your.</v>

1670
01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:23.570
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you see amy,</v>

1671
01:19:24.020 --> 01:19:27.170
<v Speaker 1>amy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>amy winehouse documentary on her</v>

1672
01:19:27.171 --> 01:19:27.470
<v Speaker 1>records?</v>

1673
01:19:27.470 --> 01:19:29.720
<v Speaker 1>That's what I heard the DAP kings for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for this new one man.</v>

1674
01:19:29.721 --> 01:19:32.450
<v Speaker 1>Just the sound of what they did on those</v>
<v Speaker 1>albums.</v>

1675
01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:35.300
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's such as musician.</v>

1676
01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:38.850
<v Speaker 1>She was so like her sound,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what she put together was so high.</v>

1677
01:19:39.140 --> 01:19:43.280
<v Speaker 1>But to see how the intense pressure of</v>
<v Speaker 1>being,</v>

1678
01:19:43.281 --> 01:19:46.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>amy winehouse in quotes mean she was,</v>

1679
01:19:46.500 --> 01:19:50.840
<v Speaker 1>or Justin Bieber or anybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He likes that surrounded by enablers and</v>

1680
01:19:50.841 --> 01:19:53.440
<v Speaker 1>kept copacetic all the time and just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1681
01:19:53.441 --> 01:19:54.190
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

1682
01:19:54.190 --> 01:19:56.300
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to do other things man.</v>

1683
01:19:56.570 --> 01:19:58.340
<v Speaker 1>You gotta be grounded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1684
01:19:58.341 --> 01:20:01.280
<v Speaker 1>and I think you've got to go home and</v>
<v Speaker 1>roll around and play with blocks.</v>

1685
01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:04.730
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what got to do to get in the pool</v>

1686
01:20:04.731 --> 01:20:08.190
<v Speaker 1>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They surf on my back.</v>

1687
01:20:08.250 --> 01:20:10.380
<v Speaker 4>I go under water and swim and they try</v>
<v Speaker 4>to stand on me.</v>

1688
01:20:12.430 --> 01:20:15.930
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to hold your breath for as</v>
<v Speaker 4>long as it takes for five-year-old.</v>

1689
01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:18.490
<v Speaker 4>Stand on your back as you're floating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

1690
01:20:19.030 --> 01:20:23.760
<v Speaker 4>but I mean other things as well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like as far as not just family and loved</v>

1691
01:20:23.761 --> 01:20:26.070
<v Speaker 4>ones and friends,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which are definitely important.</v>

1692
01:20:26.071 --> 01:20:29.160
<v Speaker 4>But I also think that other disciplines</v>
<v Speaker 4>are important.</v>

1693
01:20:29.161 --> 01:20:32.370
<v Speaker 4>Other focuses of other things that are</v>
<v Speaker 4>equally interested in,</v>

1694
01:20:32.850 --> 01:20:34.470
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they alleviate some of the</v>

1695
01:20:34.471 --> 01:20:39.471
<v Speaker 4>pressure of what it is to be singularly</v>
<v Speaker 4>focused on one thing which we can get to</v>

1696
01:20:40.621 --> 01:20:43.370
<v Speaker 4>the point of madness in know unit does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1697
01:20:44.310 --> 01:20:47.600
<v Speaker 2>I got a drum kit I got really into</v>
<v Speaker 2>playing drums but six months ago just</v>

1698
01:20:47.601 --> 01:20:48.890
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's meditational man,</v>

1699
01:20:48.891 --> 01:20:52.370
<v Speaker 2>you have to relax to do it well and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not thinking about anything else.</v>

1700
01:20:52.371 --> 01:20:53.510
<v Speaker 2>And once I realized that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1701
01:20:53.511 --> 01:20:55.040
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is really good for me.</v>

1702
01:20:55.760 --> 01:20:58.160
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

1703
01:20:58.161 --> 01:20:58.881
<v Speaker 2>that's my thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm.</v>

1704
01:20:58.881 --> 01:21:02.840
<v Speaker 2>So this music thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once it becomes a career,</v>

1705
01:21:03.260 --> 01:21:07.250
<v Speaker 2>you have to be singularly focused.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially when thinking about a record</v>

1706
01:21:07.251 --> 01:21:08.084
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my wife,</v>

1707
01:21:08.150 --> 01:21:12.980
<v Speaker 2>she just kind of leaves me alone</v>
<v Speaker 2>while she sees me go to that weird</v>

1708
01:21:12.990 --> 01:21:14.750
<v Speaker 2>platelet processing place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1709
01:21:14.751 --> 01:21:15.584
<v Speaker 2>Because it's like she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1710
01:21:15.590 --> 01:21:18.560
<v Speaker 2>it's like nothing else is in the room</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyway for awhile and then I'm done and</v>

1711
01:21:18.561 --> 01:21:20.870
<v Speaker 2>you just feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1712
01:21:20.890 --> 01:21:22.130
<v Speaker 2>and then you don't write a song for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>

1713
01:21:22.700 --> 01:21:26.510
<v Speaker 4>Well she seems very smart and support.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She could recognize that that's,</v>

1714
01:21:26.730 --> 01:21:30.420
<v Speaker 4>that's so important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have friends that are in relationships</v>

1715
01:21:30.510 --> 01:21:35.510
<v Speaker 4>where the wife is not very supportive</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it resists the creative process and</v>

1716
01:21:35.751 --> 01:21:37.620
<v Speaker 4>it gives them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't understand it or</v>

1717
01:21:37.690 --> 01:21:41.410
<v Speaker 2>cheers was very creative too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she understands very independent.</v>

1718
01:21:41.411 --> 01:21:44.930
<v Speaker 2>So it's been an only child,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1719
01:21:44.950 --> 01:21:47.050
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she knows like there's just some times</v>

1720
01:21:47.051 --> 01:21:50.010
<v Speaker 2>where I have to go and be a mom.</v>

1721
01:21:50.130 --> 01:21:50.963
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>space.</v>

1722
01:21:52.330 --> 01:21:55.810
<v Speaker 4>I just don't think you get to work</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're doing right now.</v>

1723
01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:58.300
<v Speaker 4>I don't think you get to that state</v>
<v Speaker 4>unless you're a little crazy.</v>

1724
01:21:58.870 --> 01:22:01.480
<v Speaker 4>You have to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got to be locked into it,</v>

1725
01:22:01.481 --> 01:22:02.370
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1726
01:22:02.520 --> 01:22:06.760
<v Speaker 4>like by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm so sorry I leaked the name of your</v>

1727
01:22:06.761 --> 01:22:07.960
<v Speaker 4>album out it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love it.</v>

1728
01:22:08.170 --> 01:22:11.260
<v Speaker 4>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really did on Instagram,</v>

1729
01:22:11.261 --> 01:22:15.140
<v Speaker 4>but it was fucking good man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was in the gym and uh,</v>

1730
01:22:15.230 --> 01:22:16.510
<v Speaker 4>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>God damn,</v>

1731
01:22:16.511 --> 01:22:19.210
<v Speaker 4>people got to hear about this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was so high.</v>

1732
01:22:19.510 --> 01:22:22.870
<v Speaker 4>I was in Colorado and when you get high</v>
<v Speaker 4>in Colorado,</v>

1733
01:22:22.930 --> 01:22:25.930
<v Speaker 4>when you're at 8,000 feet or Utah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually 8,000 feet,</v>

1734
01:22:27.010 --> 01:22:28.900
<v Speaker 4>it just hits you in some crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1735
01:22:28.990 --> 01:22:31.900
<v Speaker 4>you feel like you're on a spaceship,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like on top of the world,</v>

1736
01:22:31.901 --> 01:22:32.710
<v Speaker 4>like your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

1737
01:22:32.710 --> 01:22:36.640
<v Speaker 4>I was feeling like I was connected to</v>
<v Speaker 4>the world and some really weird way and</v>

1738
01:22:36.641 --> 01:22:39.580
<v Speaker 4>it was at the gym just barbecued and</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1739
01:22:39.700 --> 01:22:44.700
<v Speaker 4>that album was so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was so good,</v>

1740
01:22:44.831 --> 01:22:48.580
<v Speaker 4>especially in that moment at the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Endorphins flowing.</v>

1741
01:22:50.230 --> 01:22:52.000
<v Speaker 4>And then he sent me a text,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey man,</v>

1742
01:22:52.001 --> 01:22:53.440
<v Speaker 4>I think he leaked the name of the album.</v>

1743
01:22:56.230 --> 01:22:57.250
<v Speaker 4>I went,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh no,</v>

1744
01:22:57.251 --> 01:22:58.270
<v Speaker 4>I didn't even think of that</v>

1745
01:23:00.610 --> 01:23:03.480
<v Speaker 2>man feel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Honestly at this point it's uh,</v>

1746
01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:06.070
<v Speaker 2>this is definitely a record that</v>

1747
01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:09.580
<v Speaker 1>anybody that knows about me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like them to hear as a record</v>

1748
01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:12.130
<v Speaker 1>because that's how I wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>recorded it to be heard.</v>

1749
01:23:12.540 --> 01:23:14.860
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the interesting aspects of</v>

1750
01:23:14.861 --> 01:23:15.700
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1751
01:23:15.850 --> 01:23:20.760
<v Speaker 1>It's obviously I'm one piece.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1752
01:23:21.640 --> 01:23:22.590
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you um,</v>

1753
01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:25.390
<v Speaker 1>you sent me two versions of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was kind of cool to,</v>

1754
01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:29.770
<v Speaker 1>or the people did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they sent me one version which is just</v>

1755
01:23:29.860 --> 01:23:34.860
<v Speaker 1>one recording and then the other one is</v>
<v Speaker 1>side two and then another one where all</v>

1756
01:23:35.801 --> 01:23:38.110
<v Speaker 1>the songs were broken down individually</v>
<v Speaker 1>song.</v>

1757
01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:39.970
<v Speaker 1>But it almost feels like I shouldn't be</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at that,</v>

1758
01:23:40.390 --> 01:23:42.190
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean ideally I would,</v>

1759
01:23:42.700 --> 01:23:46.330
<v Speaker 1>that's not how I wasn't designed to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>heard,</v>

1760
01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:51.070
<v Speaker 1>broken apart I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But people like to hear like one song,</v>

1761
01:23:51.071 --> 01:23:54.820
<v Speaker 1>if they're in the car for 10 minutes on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way home to like to hear one song,</v>

1762
01:23:54.880 --> 01:23:55.810
<v Speaker 1>it's not a bad thing.</v>

1763
01:23:56.260 --> 01:24:00.040
<v Speaker 1>Know all of my favorite records,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like have my top four or five records</v>

1764
01:24:00.041 --> 01:24:04.300
<v Speaker 1>are all concept records and most of them</v>
<v Speaker 1>are in song cycle,</v>

1765
01:24:04.301 --> 01:24:06.940
<v Speaker 1>which is</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they call it.</v>

1766
01:24:06.941 --> 01:24:08.260
<v Speaker 1>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like dark side of the moon where it's</v>

1767
01:24:08.261 --> 01:24:11.500
<v Speaker 1>just one continuous wall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wall or the wall or what's going on.</v>

1768
01:24:11.730 --> 01:24:16.730
<v Speaker 1>But Marvin Gaye,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on was one console and song</v>

1769
01:24:16.931 --> 01:24:21.250
<v Speaker 1>cycle that was written from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative of a Vietnam vet returning</v>

1770
01:24:21.251 --> 01:24:24.400
<v Speaker 1>home to like an inner city home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And trying to adapt to society.</v>

1771
01:24:24.401 --> 01:24:26.260
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a heavy album man.</v>

1772
01:24:26.650 --> 01:24:30.160
<v Speaker 1>And then astral weeks by Van Morrison,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've ever heard that record,</v>

1773
01:24:30.161 --> 01:24:32.200
<v Speaker 1>that's some powerful dope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1774
01:24:32.201 --> 01:24:33.050
<v Speaker 1>I haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1775
01:24:33.250 --> 01:24:35.680
<v Speaker 1>it's all about the journey of your soul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The soul's life.</v>

1776
01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:39.050
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never got into van Morrison other than</v>

1777
01:24:39.620 --> 01:24:43.690
<v Speaker 1>she's one of my favorite songs ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always wonder what that was.</v>

1778
01:24:43.890 --> 01:24:46.810
<v Speaker 1>That's what he called his commercial</v>
<v Speaker 1>album because astral weeks,</v>

1779
01:24:46.870 --> 01:24:49.410
<v Speaker 1>although it's now considered probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the greatest records ever</v>

1780
01:24:49.420 --> 01:24:53.200
<v Speaker 1>recorded in silvery will because it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>two RC for a lot of people.</v>

1781
01:24:53.201 --> 01:24:55.540
<v Speaker 1>So then he turned around and</v>
<v Speaker 1>intentionally made a more commercially</v>

1782
01:24:55.541 --> 01:24:59.290
<v Speaker 1>accessible album.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was moondance and course sold a</v>

1783
01:24:59.291 --> 01:25:02.560
<v Speaker 1>gazillion copies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whenever I think about Marvin Gaye,</v>

1784
01:25:02.650 --> 01:25:06.850
<v Speaker 1>I think about this check that date</v>
<v Speaker 1>because when Marvin Gaye got shot and</v>

1785
01:25:06.851 --> 01:25:09.850
<v Speaker 1>killed by his dad here in La,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1786
01:25:10.180 --> 01:25:14.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where he was in Los Angeles</v>
<v Speaker 1>by a tragic story.</v>

1787
01:25:14.830 --> 01:25:16.870
<v Speaker 1>He got shot and killed by his own</v>
<v Speaker 1>father.</v>

1788
01:25:17.410 --> 01:25:20.560
<v Speaker 1>The girl I was dating goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what kind of a horrible person must have</v>

1789
01:25:20.590 --> 01:25:24.240
<v Speaker 1>been that his dad shot him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went,</v>

1790
01:25:24.740 --> 01:25:27.970
<v Speaker 1>what</v>
<v Speaker 1>worked?</v>

1791
01:25:30.570 --> 01:25:34.780
<v Speaker 1>But that was how she viewed the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like your father shot you.</v>

1792
01:25:35.020 --> 01:25:37.300
<v Speaker 1>You must have been a horrible person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So fuck,</v>

1793
01:25:37.780 --> 01:25:40.600
<v Speaker 1>fuck him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's probably my favorite musician.</v>

1794
01:25:40.601 --> 01:25:43.870
<v Speaker 1>Veltassa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll know more about Marvin Gaye then we</v>

1795
01:25:43.871 --> 01:25:46.630
<v Speaker 1>want to go into really as a really dark</v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

1796
01:25:46.690 --> 01:25:47.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1797
01:25:47.350 --> 01:25:49.270
<v Speaker 1>The council,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a,</v>

1798
01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:52.380
<v Speaker 1>there was a lot of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Him and his dad had things that stemmed</v>

1799
01:25:52.381 --> 01:25:56.770
<v Speaker 1>from childhood things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dad was a preacher one but also a cross</v>

1800
01:25:56.771 --> 01:25:59.860
<v Speaker 1>dresser.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so Marvin I think was ridiculed a</v>

1801
01:25:59.861 --> 01:26:02.650
<v Speaker 1>lot and Carlotta shamed for that and his</v>
<v Speaker 1>dad was very strict,</v>

1802
01:26:03.530 --> 01:26:04.550
<v Speaker 1>really tyrannical</v>

1803
01:26:04.970 --> 01:26:07.460
<v Speaker 2>rule in the house and beat his mom a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot.</v>

1804
01:26:09.530 --> 01:26:14.530
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of Marvin sexual deviancy later</v>
<v Speaker 2>on and they think probably stemmed from,</v>

1805
01:26:15.210 --> 01:26:17.270
<v Speaker 2>from some of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean it was just a really highly</v>

1806
01:26:17.271 --> 01:26:21.520
<v Speaker 2>sensitive guy and in a genius at that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1807
01:26:23.180 --> 01:26:27.620
<v Speaker 2>don't know what kind of sexual deviancy</v>
<v Speaker 2>was he involved in war?</v>

1808
01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:28.790
<v Speaker 2>You never heard that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1809
01:26:28.810 --> 01:26:31.230
<v Speaker 2>err the gas dirty laundry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if there's books about it he's</v>

1810
01:26:31.250 --> 01:26:32.540
<v Speaker 2>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like s and m bondage.</v>

1811
01:26:32.541 --> 01:26:36.030
<v Speaker 2>I think he had a free,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty substantial porn collection.</v>

1812
01:26:36.130 --> 01:26:36.950
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1813
01:26:36.950 --> 01:26:39.970
<v Speaker 2>Like the talk has a 17 year old</v>
<v Speaker 2>girlfriends and the [inaudible] and</v>

1814
01:26:39.980 --> 01:26:42.440
<v Speaker 2>threesomes and that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was illegal back then.</v>

1815
01:26:43.070 --> 01:26:44.140
<v Speaker 2>He was just living,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bro,</v>

1816
01:26:46.440 --> 01:26:50.510
<v Speaker 2>got on the radio and it went from there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think after the height of his fame</v>

1817
01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:54.920
<v Speaker 2>and he was best selling record,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was married to the daughter of the</v>

1818
01:26:54.921 --> 01:26:59.921
<v Speaker 2>president of motown or sister or one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other and she divorced him basically</v>

1819
01:27:00.471 --> 01:27:03.830
<v Speaker 2>and took everything like the whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>fortune and to smoking crack in a bread</v>

1820
01:27:03.831 --> 01:27:06.560
<v Speaker 2>truck and Hawaii and him.</v>

1821
01:27:06.740 --> 01:27:09.170
<v Speaker 2>This is after he's Marvin fucking gay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1822
01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:11.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

1823
01:27:11.091 --> 01:27:13.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just went down hill from there.</v>

1824
01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:16.910
<v Speaker 2>Nobody could get to him or help him out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we had to move back in with his</v>

1825
01:27:16.911 --> 01:27:21.020
<v Speaker 2>parents as a grown ass man and while</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's Marvin fucking gay.</v>

1826
01:27:21.050 --> 01:27:25.070
<v Speaker 2>And then they think a lot of people say</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where the source of all the</v>

1827
01:27:25.071 --> 01:27:28.580
<v Speaker 2>trauma and pain him going back to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at that stage in his life was the worst</v>

1828
01:27:28.581 --> 01:27:30.260
<v Speaker 2>thing that could have happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Being around his dad,</v>

1829
01:27:30.710 --> 01:27:32.900
<v Speaker 2>his dad apparently had an argument and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1830
01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:36.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>told his dad like if he ever touched his</v>

1831
01:27:36.531 --> 01:27:39.290
<v Speaker 2>mom again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he killed him and his dad said,</v>

1832
01:27:39.291 --> 01:27:40.670
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you ever lay a hand on me,</v>

1833
01:27:40.671 --> 01:27:43.580
<v Speaker 2>I'll kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think on some people speculate</v>

1834
01:27:43.610 --> 01:27:46.650
<v Speaker 2>that Marvin was just so done with all of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1835
01:27:46.670 --> 01:27:50.510
<v Speaker 2>The fame and everything that he knew by</v>
<v Speaker 2>punching his father,</v>

1836
01:27:50.570 --> 01:27:55.570
<v Speaker 2>it would get him out of it was dad shot</v>
<v Speaker 2>him twice upstairs in the bedroom.</v>

1837
01:27:56.150 --> 01:27:58.690
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the,</v>

1838
01:27:58.780 --> 01:28:02.270
<v Speaker 2>I think he laid there for about 20</v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes bleeding in the that the</v>

1839
01:28:02.300 --> 01:28:04.160
<v Speaker 2>ambulance showed up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The paramedics couldn't come into the</v>

1840
01:28:04.161 --> 01:28:06.680
<v Speaker 2>House as long as the dad was still in</v>
<v Speaker 2>there with the gun.</v>

1841
01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:10.490
<v Speaker 2>So I think his sister in law brother</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody to come in and like find the</v>

1842
01:28:10.491 --> 01:28:11.800
<v Speaker 2>gun that his father had hidden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's?</v>

1843
01:28:11.810 --> 01:28:13.530
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't talking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Man.</v>

1844
01:28:13.580 --> 01:28:15.560
<v Speaker 2>It took.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So by the time they got him out of the</v>

1845
01:28:15.561 --> 01:28:18.110
<v Speaker 2>house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Marvin died in the ambulance to the</v>

1846
01:28:18.111 --> 01:28:18.944
<v Speaker 2>hospital.</v>

1847
01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:22.593

<v Speaker 2>it's almost like overwhelming desire to</v>

<v Speaker 2>express himself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1867
01:29:44.100 --> 01:29:46.320
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think she was 17 when he wrote that</v>

1868
01:29:46.321 --> 01:29:48.810
<v Speaker 1>album for really a little young</v>
<v Speaker 1>mistress.</v>

1869
01:29:49.230 --> 01:29:50.400
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's dark.</v>

1870
01:29:50.460 --> 01:29:55.460

<v Speaker 1>deed for record 17.</v>

1871
01:29:56.550 --> 01:29:59.880
<v Speaker 1>So there's a song called really love to</v>
<v Speaker 1>ball</v>

1872
01:30:01.400 --> 01:30:02.640
<v Speaker 1>landed that album.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1873
01:30:02.670 --> 01:30:04.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's just like women moaning and</v>

1874
01:30:04.651 --> 01:30:08.680
<v Speaker 1>orgasm and really goes was fearless man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

1875
01:30:08.800 --> 01:30:12.030
<v Speaker 1>Just get away with it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At that time it was probably sold so</v>

1876
01:30:12.031 --> 01:30:13.110
<v Speaker 1>many records,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I</v>

1877
01:30:15.150 --> 01:30:16.470
<v Speaker 1>didn't tour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He never toured.</v>

1878
01:30:16.560 --> 01:30:17.820
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hardly ever really.</v>

1879
01:30:17.821 --> 01:30:19.710
<v Speaker 1>Couldn't drag him out on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1880
01:30:19.711 --> 01:30:23.130
<v Speaker 1>Shit really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think when,</v>

1881
01:30:23.131 --> 01:30:24.840
<v Speaker 1>when let's get it on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was blowing up.</v>

1882
01:30:24.841 --> 01:30:29.640
<v Speaker 1>He was living in a cabin up in top of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Topanga Canyon with his girlfriend and</v>

1883
01:30:29.641 --> 01:30:31.380
<v Speaker 1>just hiding from the world doing blow.</v>

1884
01:30:33.540 --> 01:30:36.600
<v Speaker 1>Literally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He played one concert that entire record</v>

1885
01:30:36.601 --> 01:30:39.870
<v Speaker 1>cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where everybody lived back then.</v>

1886
01:30:40.410 --> 01:30:45.030
<v Speaker 1>I saw Hendrix house was for sale a few</v>
<v Speaker 1>years back as a house at Hendricks</v>

1887
01:30:45.210 --> 01:30:46.980
<v Speaker 1>bought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They never moved into.</v>

1888
01:30:47.250 --> 01:30:50.670
<v Speaker 1>He bought it right before he died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll take it.</v>

1889
01:30:51.430 --> 01:30:54.030
<v Speaker 1>Even if even if he did live there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1890
01:30:54.031 --> 01:30:56.910
<v Speaker 1>I'll still buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to know if he.</v>

1891
01:30:56.911 --> 01:30:59.450
<v Speaker 1>If he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did he write something anywhere?</v>

1892
01:30:59.451 --> 01:31:02.120
<v Speaker 1>It was it in paper that he walk in and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was there.</v>

1893
01:31:02.180 --> 01:31:05.550
<v Speaker 1>He probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he must have bought it so he had to look</v>

1894
01:31:05.551 --> 01:31:06.810
<v Speaker 1>at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you looked at it,</v>

1895
01:31:06.930 --> 01:31:08.730
<v Speaker 1>he was in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he walked around.</v>

1896
01:31:09.150 --> 01:31:11.780
<v Speaker 1>I take it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He probably bone the realtor.</v>

1897
01:31:12.710 --> 01:31:14.340
<v Speaker 1>Fucking take it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>was wilt Chamberlain's house that had</v>

1899
01:31:17.821 --> 01:31:20.490
<v Speaker 1>the whole deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It had a circular bed that spun around.</v>

1900
01:31:20.670 --> 01:31:24.050
<v Speaker 1>It was like the ultimate fuck castle and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1901
01:31:24.470 --> 01:31:28.560
<v Speaker 1>will chamberlain on his way to Bang in</v>
<v Speaker 1>10,000 different women allegedly</v>

1902
01:31:28.770 --> 01:31:30.220
<v Speaker 1>according to him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1903
01:31:30.230 --> 01:31:33.120
<v Speaker 1>and he had just this insane bachelor</v>
<v Speaker 1>pad.</v>

1904
01:31:33.390 --> 01:31:35.190
<v Speaker 1>That was just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did he get anything else?</v>

1905
01:31:35.191 --> 01:31:36.060
<v Speaker 1>Look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at it.</v>

1906

<v Speaker 1>That's this house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that bad.</v>

1907
01:31:38.730 --> 01:31:42.090
<v Speaker 1>That's the way it looks like the enter</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Dragon.</v>

1908
01:31:42.390 --> 01:31:47.390
<v Speaker 1>Mr Han's fucking palace or something</v>
<v Speaker 1>is going on there,</v>

1909
01:31:47.491 --> 01:31:49.090
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah.</v>

1910
01:31:49.110 --> 01:31:52.030
<v Speaker 1>I'd be walking around and they're like</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to find myself in the mirror.</v>

1911
01:31:52.290 --> 01:31:57.290
<v Speaker 1>Oh look at that shit a few years back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That house is that the outside of it.</v>

1912
01:31:59.200 --> 01:32:03.520
<v Speaker 1>A few years back the house was for sale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an epic epic house.</v>

1913
01:32:03.980 --> 01:32:05.950
<v Speaker 1>Like I'll fuck my dog too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not afraid.</v>

1914
01:32:05.980 --> 01:32:10.270
<v Speaker 1>But they had a really hard time selling</v>
<v Speaker 1>it because it was worth a lot of money.</v>

1915
01:32:10.271 --> 01:32:11.260
<v Speaker 1>That place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1916
01:32:11.740 --> 01:32:14.650
<v Speaker 1>it was worth a lot of money and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't the kind of house that a normal</v>

1917
01:32:14.651 --> 01:32:18.100
<v Speaker 1>person could live in one bedroom</v>
<v Speaker 1>chamberlain's bungalow.</v>

1918
01:32:18.380 --> 01:32:21.540
<v Speaker 1>Would you see that now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at the pool tables like whereas</v>

1919
01:32:21.550 --> 01:32:22.450
<v Speaker 1>knees are.</v>

1920
01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:28.570
<v Speaker 1>It's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if that house ever sold.</v>

1921
01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:31.360
<v Speaker 1>It might be one of those things that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>just keep selling them buying,</v>

1922
01:32:31.390 --> 01:32:35.830
<v Speaker 1>but it's really funky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like modern for the 19 eighties.</v>

1923
01:32:35.831 --> 01:32:38.170
<v Speaker 1>Look in the crew man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah man,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's all angular and shit.</v>

1925
01:32:40.540 --> 01:32:43.840
<v Speaker 1>Like a transformer to two and a half</v>
<v Speaker 1>acres.</v>

1926
01:32:44.140 --> 01:32:45.450
<v Speaker 1>Like it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're expected to go</v>

1927
01:32:47.590 --> 01:32:49.230
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for now here,</v>

1928
01:32:49.240 --> 01:32:50.920
<v Speaker 1>even if it wasn't wilt Chamberlain's</v>

01:33:42.941 --> 01:33:45.550
<v Speaker 1>So it might still be available.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1948
01:33:45.551 --> 01:33:46.330
<v Speaker 1>I bet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1949
01:33:46.330 --> 01:33:48.370
<v Speaker 1>I bet a house like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People buy it and they go,</v>

1950
01:33:48.371 --> 01:33:50.470
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are we doing here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's make some money.</v>

1951
01:33:50.471 --> 01:33:52.120
<v Speaker 1>It's in Bel Air and then they sell that</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1952
01:33:52.150 --> 01:33:52.983
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bill there.</v>

1953
01:33:53.380 --> 01:33:55.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an expensive neighborhood.</v>

1954
01:33:55.540 --> 01:33:59.230
<v Speaker 1>Dope views must be good to be wilt</v>
<v Speaker 1>chamberlain back with no Internet.</v>

1955
01:33:59.560 --> 01:34:01.150
<v Speaker 1>No twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no facebook.</v>

1956
01:34:01.180 --> 01:34:02.890
<v Speaker 1>Just all dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1957
01:34:02.891 --> 01:34:05.770
<v Speaker 1>Those guys really just mean free for</v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

1958
01:34:05.860 --> 01:34:07.360
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on man.</v>

1959
01:34:07.361 --> 01:34:08.620
<v Speaker 1>It's chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The president,</v>

1960
01:34:08.920 --> 01:34:11.260
<v Speaker 1>President Kennedy was on a free for all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1961
01:34:11.261 --> 01:34:14.690
<v Speaker 1>imagine that the president just call him</v>
<v Speaker 1>buck wild.</v>

1962
01:34:14.770 --> 01:34:18.250
<v Speaker 1>What's amazing is that everyone in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>news,</v>

1963
01:34:18.490 --> 01:34:20.050
<v Speaker 1>like all the reporters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all knew it.</v>

1964
01:34:20.230 --> 01:34:21.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't.</v>

1965
01:34:21.210 --> 01:34:23.830
<v Speaker 1>They didn't talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was me stories written about it.</v>

1966
01:34:24.740 --> 01:34:26.770
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what that shift was.</v>

1967
01:34:27.340 --> 01:34:31.120
<v Speaker 1>The shift was in America where they</v>
<v Speaker 1>decided that they were just going to</v>

1968
01:34:31.121 --> 01:34:34.070
<v Speaker 1>talk about everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what caused sold.</v>

1969
01:34:34.630 --> 01:34:35.321
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess so.</v>

1970
01:34:35.321 --> 01:34:37.150
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once I figured out that's all people</v>

1971
01:34:37.151 --> 01:34:42.151
<v Speaker 1>want is gossip was like once there was</v>
<v Speaker 1>too many different distribution methods,</v>

1972
01:34:42.911 --> 01:34:44.380
<v Speaker 1>it seems like that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1973
01:34:44.620 --> 01:34:48.580
<v Speaker 1>Like if you only have like a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>different newspapers and a couple of</v>

1974
01:34:48.581 --> 01:34:50.770
<v Speaker 1>different television shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can all be kind of controlled.</v>

1975
01:34:50.810 --> 01:34:52.270
<v Speaker 1>I monopolize go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1976
01:34:52.271 --> 01:34:56.080
<v Speaker 1>And you also put pressure on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>reporters probably did not reveal that</v>

1977
01:34:56.081 --> 01:34:57.340
<v Speaker 1>stuff and that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm,</v>

1978
01:34:57.450 --> 01:34:58.030
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you</v>

1979
01:34:58.030 --> 01:35:00.500
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like something on the radio in the car</v>

1980
01:35:00.501 --> 01:35:03.150
<v Speaker 2>when I was coming here about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a big data models today.</v>

1981
01:35:03.160 --> 01:35:04.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1982
01:35:04.580 --> 01:35:07.340
<v Speaker 2>I haven't gotten into it hurt the cliff</v>
<v Speaker 2>notes,</v>

1983
01:35:07.341 --> 01:35:09.950
<v Speaker 2>but it sounds pretty heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's supposed to be the biggest leak of</v>

1984
01:35:09.951 --> 01:35:12.660
<v Speaker 2>documentary millions of pages or.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1985
01:35:12.950 --> 01:35:17.060
<v Speaker 2>and apparently it just shows all this</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy collusion between world leaders</v>

1986
01:35:17.061 --> 01:35:20.280
<v Speaker 2>and financial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to obsess about that shit and I</v>

1987
01:35:20.281 --> 01:35:21.730
<v Speaker 2>wanted to know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1988
01:35:21.810 --> 01:35:25.250
<v Speaker 2>like man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now at this stage in my life,</v>

1989
01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:26.833
<v Speaker 2>I mean</v>

1990
01:35:27.590 --> 01:35:32.570
<v Speaker 4>I just go ahead and assume it's all</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking crooked and so it is definitely</v>

1991
01:35:32.571 --> 01:35:34.370
<v Speaker 4>all crooked,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know what I think,</v>

1992
01:35:34.371 --> 01:35:35.840
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even think.</v>

1993
01:35:35.960 --> 01:35:37.520
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think everybody's got to pay attention</v>

1994
01:35:37.521 --> 01:35:39.530
<v Speaker 4>to it obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean we're all paying attention to it,</v>

1995
01:35:39.531 --> 01:35:42.830
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think it's sustainable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think you could do it anymore.</v>

1996
01:35:43.130 --> 01:35:47.030
<v Speaker 4>I think these leaks are going to come</v>
<v Speaker 4>more and more frequently and they're</v>

1997
01:35:47.031 --> 01:35:49.850
<v Speaker 4>going to be more and more accessible and</v>
<v Speaker 4>more and more easy to get.</v>

1998
01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.940
<v Speaker 4>I just don't think you're gonna be able</v>
<v Speaker 4>to fuck people like that anymore.</v>

1999
01:35:53.120 --> 01:35:54.980
<v Speaker 4>I just don't think you could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even the government,</v>

2000
01:35:55.340 --> 01:35:58.100
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they could do it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think what they're doing now,</v>

2001
01:35:58.101 --> 01:36:00.140
<v Speaker 4>even right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're like Klingon,</v>

2002
01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:02.870
<v Speaker 4>just hanging onto this thing while it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>shaken.</v>

2003
01:36:02.871 --> 01:36:06.860
<v Speaker 4>Apart around them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because the apple fiasco and supposed to</v>

2004
01:36:06.861 --> 01:36:08.150
<v Speaker 4>be in control of us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2005
01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:09.230
<v Speaker 4>that's the bottom line.</v>

2006
01:36:09.330 --> 01:36:11.120
<v Speaker 4>You're not supposed to be in control of</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jamie.</v>

2007
01:36:11.250 --> 01:36:13.850
<v Speaker 4>Jamie's not supposed to be in control of</v>
<v Speaker 4>me and the government's not supposed to</v>

2008
01:36:13.851 --> 01:36:14.684
<v Speaker 4>be in control.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You.</v>

2009
01:36:14.870 --> 01:36:18.830
<v Speaker 4>You're supposed to be some operating</v>
<v Speaker 4>principles that we all commune under and</v>

2010
01:36:18.831 --> 01:36:22.370
<v Speaker 4>our community should be established in a</v>
<v Speaker 4>way that benefits us.</v>

2011
01:36:22.580 --> 01:36:24.830
<v Speaker 4>Not the big banks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not the politicians,</v>

2012
01:36:24.950 --> 01:36:28.970
<v Speaker 4>not fucking Hillary Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 4>given $250,000 speaker speeches to a</v>

2013
01:36:28.971 --> 01:36:32.480
<v Speaker 4>bunch of Wall Street people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's all nonsense and that's some old</v>

2014
01:36:32.481 --> 01:36:37.010
<v Speaker 4>shit that we just assume we have to stay</v>
<v Speaker 4>with because it's been this way from the</v>

2015
01:36:37.011 --> 01:36:39.170
<v Speaker 4>jump.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's been this way since we were kids.</v>

2016
01:36:39.320 --> 01:36:42.580
<v Speaker 4>While my parents grew up with it and</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is the system bullshit.</v>

2017
01:36:42.770 --> 01:36:45.830
<v Speaker 4>They're staying with this system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not because it's the best,</v>

2018
01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:49.400
<v Speaker 4>but because they figure the best way to</v>
<v Speaker 4>extract money from it.</v>

2019
01:36:49.670 --> 01:36:51.020
<v Speaker 4>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not gonna be able to do it.</v>

2020
01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:53.900
<v Speaker 4>It's not going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Once president trump gets in office,</v>

2021
01:36:54.310 --> 01:36:57.920
<v Speaker 4>everyone's going to realize what a</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking God damn joke of a system we put</v>

2022
01:36:57.921 --> 01:37:02.120
<v Speaker 4>in place and there'll be some real talk</v>
<v Speaker 4>about having some kind of a radical</v>

2023
01:37:02.121 --> 01:37:02.954
<v Speaker 4>reform.</v>

2024
01:37:05.800 --> 01:37:09.820
<v Speaker 2>Like what if they could just fire</v>
<v Speaker 2>members of the Senate or the House</v>

2025
01:37:09.821 --> 01:37:12.220
<v Speaker 2>representatives or congress that you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>fired.</v>

2026
01:37:12.830 --> 01:37:15.340
<v Speaker 2>You can't just say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to do our jobs.</v>

2027
01:37:15.950 --> 01:37:16.783
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2028
01:37:17.470 --> 01:37:19.810
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dishes too many people that you don't</v>

2029
01:37:19.811 --> 01:37:23.920
<v Speaker 4>know that have any say whatsoever on how</v>
<v Speaker 4>you live your life,</v>

2030
01:37:24.310 --> 01:37:29.140
<v Speaker 4>like the idea that the Senate or that</v>
<v Speaker 4>Congress or that the Supreme Court and</v>

2031
01:37:29.141 --> 01:37:33.820
<v Speaker 4>these people could sit down and decide</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what you can can't do with your</v>

2032
01:37:33.821 --> 01:37:36.400
<v Speaker 4>body,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what substances you can or can't put</v>

2033
01:37:36.401 --> 01:37:37.870
<v Speaker 4>into them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which shouldn't,</v>

2034
01:37:37.871 --> 01:37:40.480
<v Speaker 4>shouldn't be illegal like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You.</v>

2035
01:37:40.540 --> 01:37:42.310
<v Speaker 4>You shouldn't be able to decide that.</v>

2036
01:37:42.460 --> 01:37:45.530
<v Speaker 2>The Nixon thing the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was pretty interesting about where</v>

2037
01:37:45.570 --> 01:37:46.480
<v Speaker 2>they were just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2038
01:37:46.481 --> 01:37:48.100
<v Speaker 2>we should do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just,</v>

2039
01:37:48.101 --> 01:37:49.150
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2040
01:37:49.300 --> 01:37:51.410
<v Speaker 2>We'll tell people what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They.</v>

2041
01:37:51.580 --> 01:37:53.230
<v Speaker 2>There was a former aide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

2042
01:37:53.610 --> 01:37:54.550
<v Speaker 2>Was that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was that right?</v>

2043
01:37:54.870 --> 01:37:56.680
<v Speaker 2>Somebody in his.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2044
01:37:56.700 --> 01:38:00.090
<v Speaker 2>Someone basically came out and said that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the war on drugs was propagated to</v>

2045
01:38:00.091 --> 01:38:03.450
<v Speaker 2>suppress minorities and a anti war</v>
<v Speaker 2>movement,</v>

2046
01:38:03.451 --> 01:38:04.930
<v Speaker 2>Antiwar Movement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they,</v>

2047
01:38:04.931 --> 01:38:08.460
<v Speaker 2>they knew that there was no threat there</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it wasn't doing anything harmful to</v>

2048
01:38:08.461 --> 01:38:11.850
<v Speaker 2>people and and basically they're on tape</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about it and laughing.</v>

2049
01:38:12.060 --> 01:38:14.910
<v Speaker 2>Unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody on late night the other night</v>

2050
01:38:14.911 --> 01:38:16.830
<v Speaker 2>when it came out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they said it perfectly like that.</v>

2051
01:38:16.860 --> 01:38:19.770
<v Speaker 2>Even from the grave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy manages to cultivate more</v>

2052
01:38:19.771 --> 01:38:21.930
<v Speaker 2>fucking hatred.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was so crazy.</v>

2053
01:38:22.270 --> 01:38:22.760
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

2054
01:38:22.760 --> 01:38:23.610
<v Speaker 2>Evil Bastard.</v>

2055
01:38:23.980 --> 01:38:25.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was last week.</v>

2056
01:38:25.270 --> 01:38:28.810
<v Speaker 4>Quote from Richard Nixon's former chief</v>
<v Speaker 4>domestic advisor,</v>

2057
01:38:28.811 --> 01:38:30.040
<v Speaker 4>John Eric,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Eric,</v>

2058
01:38:30.090 --> 01:38:35.090
<v Speaker 4>Min e h r I c h Dot Heckman surfaced</v>
<v Speaker 4>confirming a disgusting truth that's</v>

2059
01:38:38.171 --> 01:38:42.130
<v Speaker 4>been very well known by black folks for</v>
<v Speaker 4>for several decades of war on drugs.</v>

2060
01:38:42.131 --> 01:38:44.590
<v Speaker 4>Had nothing to do with eradicating it</v>
<v Speaker 4>drug epidemic.</v>

2061
01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:47.890
<v Speaker 4>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a ploy to hide for the</v>

2062
01:38:47.891 --> 01:38:52.070
<v Speaker 4>intentional targeting and decimating of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the black community.</v>

2063
01:38:52.120 --> 01:38:55.120
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as well as the real thing.</v>

2064
01:38:55.330 --> 01:38:58.960
<v Speaker 4>This is Eric Men's words.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said the Nixon campaign in 1968 in</v>

2065
01:38:58.961 --> 01:39:01.630
<v Speaker 4>the Nixon White House after that had two</v>
<v Speaker 4>enemies.</v>

2066
01:39:01.690 --> 01:39:05.260
<v Speaker 4>The antiwar left and black people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You understand what I'm saying?</v>

2067
01:39:05.290 --> 01:39:08.830
<v Speaker 4>We knew that we couldn't make it illegal</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be either against the war or black,</v>

2068
01:39:08.831 --> 01:39:11.650
<v Speaker 4>but by getting the public to associate</v>
<v Speaker 4>the hippies with marijuana and the</v>

2069
01:39:11.651 --> 01:39:14.350
<v Speaker 4>blacks with heroin and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>criminalizing both heavily,</v>

2070
01:39:14.351 --> 01:39:16.420
<v Speaker 4>we could disrupt those communities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

2071
01:39:16.540 --> 01:39:18.700
<v Speaker 4>We could arrest their leaders,</v>
<v Speaker 4>raid their homes,</v>

2072
01:39:18.701 --> 01:39:22.390
<v Speaker 4>break up their meetings,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and vilify them night after night on the</v>

2073
01:39:22.390 --> 01:39:23.170
<v Speaker 4>evening news.</v>

2074
01:39:23.170 --> 01:39:26.920
<v Speaker 4>Holy fucking shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did we know we were lying about drugs?</v>

2075
01:39:27.160 --> 01:39:29.260
<v Speaker 4>Of course we did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>

2076
01:39:30.190 --> 01:39:32.050
<v Speaker 4>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's dark.</v>

2077
01:39:33.280 --> 01:39:35.050
<v Speaker 4>That guy's only concentrating on black</v>
<v Speaker 4>people though.</v>

2078
01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:39.160
<v Speaker 4>Do you go to an all black site that guys</v>
<v Speaker 4>just wants to talk about?</v>

2079
01:39:39.161 --> 01:39:42.610
<v Speaker 4>The black part is you got a big smiling</v>
<v Speaker 4>black phase.</v>

2080
01:39:43.390 --> 01:39:46.390
<v Speaker 4>The whole thing is disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's disgusting that we live under the</v>

2081
01:39:46.391 --> 01:39:49.120
<v Speaker 4>echoes of all these morons that were</v>
<v Speaker 4>running the country back then.</v>

2082
01:39:49.121 --> 01:39:53.350
<v Speaker 4>All these creeps that could get away</v>
<v Speaker 4>with shit just like wilt chamberlains up</v>

2083
01:39:53.351 --> 01:39:56.770
<v Speaker 4>there banging up a storm and Marvin</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gaye's cooked up into pain canyon with a</v>

2084
01:39:56.771 --> 01:39:58.870
<v Speaker 4>17 year old.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can get away with anything back</v>

2085
01:39:58.871 --> 01:40:00.430
<v Speaker 4>then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Apparently.</v>

2086
01:40:00.431 --> 01:40:01.960
<v Speaker 4>You still can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>R Kelly.</v>

2087
01:40:02.290 --> 01:40:06.670
<v Speaker 4>Paula r Kelly allegedly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's,</v>

2088
01:40:06.671 --> 01:40:07.504
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2089
01:40:08.490 --> 01:40:10.240
<v Speaker 2>Dick Cheney,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could just shoot people the fucking</v>

2090
01:40:10.250 --> 01:40:12.040
<v Speaker 2>face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Literally.</v>

2091
01:40:12.100 --> 01:40:12.933
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Literally.</v>

2092
01:40:13.320 --> 01:40:14.920
<v Speaker 4>Well those.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you know what he was doing?</v>

2093
01:40:15.790 --> 01:40:18.370
<v Speaker 4>It's a canned hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So those are weird man.</v>

2094
01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.610
<v Speaker 4>Do you know what that is?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's really go out and you're</v>

2095
01:40:21.611 --> 01:40:25.780
<v Speaker 4>basically guaranteed a trophy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No bird hunting.</v>

2096
01:40:25.960 --> 01:40:28.710
<v Speaker 4>So what happens is they go out and they</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2097
01:40:28.780 --> 01:40:32.890
<v Speaker 4>they open up these fucking boxes of</v>
<v Speaker 4>birds and the birds fly out and they</v>

2098
01:40:32.891 --> 01:40:37.450
<v Speaker 4>shoot them and he's still shot somebody</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the face to face and he didn't talk</v>

2099
01:40:37.451 --> 01:40:39.970
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He wouldn't talk to anybody for like 16</v>

2100
01:40:39.971 --> 01:40:43.360
<v Speaker 4>hours afterwards was probably hammered.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was hammered,</v>

2101
01:40:43.740 --> 01:40:45.790
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most likely he was hammered.</v>

2102
01:40:46.210 --> 01:40:47.980
<v Speaker 4>Allegedly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Allegedly.</v>

2103
01:40:49.160 --> 01:40:51.010
<v Speaker 4>Can you still sue?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even though it doesn't have a heart,</v>

2104
01:40:51.190 --> 01:40:53.380
<v Speaker 4>it was like an artificial heart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's still out of Su,</v>

2105
01:40:54.490 --> 01:40:57.280
<v Speaker 3>but he shot his friend in his face and</v>
<v Speaker 3>his friend apologized.</v>

2106
01:40:57.760 --> 01:40:59.680
<v Speaker 3>That's how fucking gangster Dick Cheney</v>
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>

2107
01:41:01.490 --> 01:41:06.100
<v Speaker 3>While his friend was like 60 walked it</v>
<v Speaker 3>off when she walked in front of your</v>

2108
01:41:06.101 --> 01:41:06.934
<v Speaker 3>bullets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bro,</v>

2109
01:41:07.780 --> 01:41:10.120
<v Speaker 3>they would probably live out of their</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking mind.</v>

2110
01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:15.840
<v Speaker 3>Just that you want to talk about ptsd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you imagine the demons inside the</v>

2111
01:41:16.481 --> 01:41:18.630
<v Speaker 3>brain of Dick Cheney,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2112
01:41:18.760 --> 01:41:22.570
<v Speaker 3>just knowing what he knows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could you imagine?</v>

2113
01:41:23.520 --> 01:41:25.920
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if that guy has an ounce of self</v>

2114
01:41:25.921 --> 01:41:28.220
<v Speaker 3>realization,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an ounce of,</v>

2115
01:41:28.320 --> 01:41:30.880
<v Speaker 3>of objectivity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of introspective thought,</v>

2116
01:41:30.910 --> 01:41:34.750
<v Speaker 3>whereas really thinks about it than I do</v>
<v Speaker 3>the right thing was I do think.</v>

2117
01:41:35.150 --> 01:41:35.983
<v Speaker 3>Do you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2118
01:41:36.700 --> 01:41:38.890
<v Speaker 3>that um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>weapons of mass destruction,</v>

2119
01:41:38.900 --> 01:41:41.590
<v Speaker 3>you think that was cool?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was that okay?</v>

2120
01:41:41.650 --> 01:41:44.090
<v Speaker 3>There's only a few hundred thousand</v>
<v Speaker 3>dollars a million people died,</v>

2121
01:41:44.091 --> 01:41:46.630
<v Speaker 3>but that it was probably for the best</v>
<v Speaker 3>historically.</v>

2122
01:41:46.930 --> 01:41:47.920
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were going to die anyway.</v>

2123
01:41:47.921 --> 01:41:49.690
<v Speaker 3>It's not like there are a million of</v>
<v Speaker 3>mortals,</v>

2124
01:41:50.020 --> 01:41:50.853
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2125
01:41:51.210 --> 01:41:53.290
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you're asking about,</v>

2126
01:41:53.320 --> 01:41:57.610
<v Speaker 3>do I think he was president?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dick Cheney seeks daily affirmation.</v>

2127
01:41:58.550 --> 01:42:02.770
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a biblical character in that right</v>

2128
01:42:02.771 --> 01:42:05.290
<v Speaker 3>after he had done all these things</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

2129
01:42:05.770 --> 01:42:08.590
<v Speaker 3>but he'd clearly pulled the strings to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get us into Iraq.</v>

2130
01:42:08.591 --> 01:42:12.040
<v Speaker 3>And there's clearly financial motives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2131
01:42:12.041 --> 01:42:16.020
<v Speaker 3>he was the god Damn Ceo of the company</v>
<v Speaker 3>that got into no bid,</v>

2132
01:42:16.030 --> 01:42:18.310
<v Speaker 3>billion dollar contract.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Palpatine man,</v>

2133
01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:20.230
<v Speaker 3>he's a damn sith Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Bush,</v>

2134
01:42:20.300 --> 01:42:22.600
<v Speaker 3>like him or hate him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He thought he was doing the right thing.</v>

2135
01:42:22.601 --> 01:42:25.990
<v Speaker 3>You know the guy believed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is the thing to undeniable</v>

2136
01:42:26.080 --> 01:42:29.590
<v Speaker 3>biblical thing about him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the guy has a ton of heart attacks,</v>

2137
01:42:29.591 --> 01:42:30.424
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2138
01:42:30.850 --> 01:42:35.500
<v Speaker 3>They replaced his fucking heart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They replaced his valves with some</v>

2139
01:42:35.501 --> 01:42:40.501
<v Speaker 3>machine and this machine constantly pump</v>
<v Speaker 3>blood to the point where he didn't have</v>

2140
01:42:41.141 --> 01:42:43.900
<v Speaker 3>a pulse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a constant flow.</v>

2141
01:42:44.410 --> 01:42:48.250
<v Speaker 3>So if you put your finger on Dick Cheney</v>
<v Speaker 3>while he had this artificial heart in</v>

2142
01:42:48.251 --> 01:42:51.220
<v Speaker 3>place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wouldn't have a pulse.</v>

2143
01:42:51.730 --> 01:42:54.190
<v Speaker 3>Started vader.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's dark vader.</v>

2144
01:42:54.220 --> 01:42:57.150
<v Speaker 3>He's fucking darth vader.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the old man at the era,</v>

2145
01:42:57.190 --> 01:43:00.090
<v Speaker 3>the promethium that was pretending to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>dead and shit.</v>

2146
01:43:00.100 --> 01:43:02.110
<v Speaker 3>You pull.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Make sure that's true.</v>

2147
01:43:02.200 --> 01:43:04.420
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure I'm correct about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie.</v>

2148
01:43:05.290 --> 01:43:09.610
<v Speaker 3>Pull that up about about Dick Cheney's</v>
<v Speaker 3>heart being artificial and not having a</v>

2149
01:43:09.611 --> 01:43:10.291
<v Speaker 3>pulse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2150
01:43:10.291 --> 01:43:11.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just reading about the actual</v>

2151
01:43:11.651 --> 01:43:15.130
<v Speaker 3>event and how it happened and he shot</v>
<v Speaker 3>him in the face and they blamed the guy</v>

2152
01:43:15.490 --> 01:43:17.520
<v Speaker 3>waiting this name for walking in front</v>
<v Speaker 3>of them.</v>

2153
01:43:21.940 --> 01:43:23.800
<v Speaker 3>Had a fucking idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>

2154
01:43:23.801 --> 01:43:25.840
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't point your gun where people</v>

2155
01:43:25.841 --> 01:43:27.610
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guy didn't walk in front of you.</v>

2156
01:43:28.060 --> 01:43:30.610
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As a person who fires guns,</v>

2157
01:43:30.760 --> 01:43:33.100
<v Speaker 3>you don't ever point your gun anywhere</v>
<v Speaker 3>near a person.</v>

2158
01:43:33.250 --> 01:43:36.550
<v Speaker 3>If a person walks in front and you pull</v>
<v Speaker 3>your gun away from where that person is,</v>

2159
01:43:37.300 --> 01:43:41.380
<v Speaker 3>if you have to be aware of your left and</v>
<v Speaker 3>your right at all times,</v>

2160
01:43:41.500 --> 01:43:44.800
<v Speaker 3>you don't stand in front of somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guy didn't just.</v>

2161
01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:49.210
<v Speaker 3>It's not that guys fault bionic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dick Cheney technically has no pulse</v>

2162
01:43:49.270 --> 01:43:52.180
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It goes during recent heart surgery at</v>

2163
01:43:52.181 --> 01:43:56.450
<v Speaker 3>doctors and planted a ventricular assist</v>
<v Speaker 3>device to augment Cheney's failing</v>

2164
01:43:56.451 --> 01:43:58.410
<v Speaker 3>ticker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it also gives us critics and other</v>

2165
01:43:58.411 --> 01:44:01.730
<v Speaker 3>punch line to work with because the</v>
<v Speaker 3>device moves blood continuously.</v>

2166
01:44:01.731 --> 01:44:04.280
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mimic the pulsating rhythm of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the heartbeat.</v>

2167
01:44:04.430 --> 01:44:08.450
<v Speaker 3>Tactically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dick Cheney no longer has a pulse in</v>

2168
01:44:08.650 --> 01:44:11.090
<v Speaker 3>insert darth vader comparisons here.</v>

2169
01:44:12.660 --> 01:44:17.540
<v Speaker 3>This is a 2010 and that's still kicking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing,</v>

2170
01:44:17.541 --> 01:44:19.910
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to do this bit about Dick Cheney</v>

2171
01:44:20.270 --> 01:44:22.760
<v Speaker 3>where you had one extra secret service</v>
<v Speaker 3>agent,</v>

2172
01:44:23.060 --> 01:44:26.240
<v Speaker 3>like every other guy had five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he had six and this one,</v>

2173
01:44:26.270 --> 01:44:29.480
<v Speaker 3>they put them on like this all</v>
<v Speaker 3>vegetarian diet and they had to do</v>

2174
01:44:29.481 --> 01:44:30.650
<v Speaker 3>jogging every day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

2175
01:44:30.651 --> 01:44:33.440
<v Speaker 3>why the fuck do I have to jog?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there was always a guy behind them</v>

2176
01:44:33.590 --> 01:44:37.520
<v Speaker 3>with a a giant cooler filled with ice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the moment Dick Cheney has a heart</v>

2177
01:44:37.521 --> 01:44:39.080
<v Speaker 3>attack,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were going to take that dude out,</v>

2178
01:44:39.320 --> 01:44:42.610
<v Speaker 3>cut his chest open,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shove his heart inside a Dick Cheney and</v>

2179
01:44:42.620 --> 01:44:46.940
<v Speaker 3>Save Dick Cheney was one extra secret</v>
<v Speaker 3>service agent that was a sacrifice.</v>

2180
01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:50.870
<v Speaker 3>He's a dark guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2181
01:44:51.380 --> 01:44:55.220
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was the CEO of the company that</v>

2182
01:44:55.221 --> 01:44:58.880
<v Speaker 3>profited the most from them blowing shit</v>
<v Speaker 3>up in Iraq</v>

2183
01:44:59.580 --> 01:45:04.580
<v Speaker 2>rope</v>
<v Speaker 2>around the time that I was in the navy,</v>

2184
01:45:04.870 --> 01:45:06.670
<v Speaker 2>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had this reimplemented,</v>

2185
01:45:06.720 --> 01:45:10.190
<v Speaker 2>this anthrax vaccination policy and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

2186
01:45:10.200 --> 01:45:13.110
<v Speaker 2>I think they've done it in the first</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gulf War Two and a lot of people think</v>

2187
01:45:13.111 --> 01:45:17.040
<v Speaker 2>is directly responsible for the Gulf War</v>
<v Speaker 2>syndrome and all those guys like dealing</v>

2188
01:45:17.041 --> 01:45:20.850
<v Speaker 2>with chronic muscle spasms and fatigue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And really,</v>

2189
01:45:20.940 --> 01:45:21.810
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>

2190
01:45:21.811 --> 01:45:24.690
<v Speaker 2>but like they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they came down the pipeline again.</v>

2191
01:45:24.691 --> 01:45:26.910
<v Speaker 2>They're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're gonna make it a mandatory thing</v>

2192
01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:30.090
<v Speaker 2>for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I think in [inaudible] 98,</v>

2193
01:45:31.320 --> 01:45:33.450
<v Speaker 2>they recalled it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember.</v>

2194
01:45:33.451 --> 01:45:36.780
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] 98 or 99 with the times and</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these people had already kind of dug</v>

2195
01:45:36.781 --> 01:45:41.781
<v Speaker 2>in and figured out that there was only</v>
<v Speaker 2>one lab in the entire world authorized</v>

2196
01:45:42.751 --> 01:45:45.140
<v Speaker 2>and regulated to manufacture the vaccine</v>
<v Speaker 2>call.</v>

2197
01:45:45.160 --> 01:45:50.160
<v Speaker 2>I think their lab was bioport up in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Michigan and one of the owners of the</v>

2198
01:45:51.361 --> 01:45:55.290
<v Speaker 2>lab was a former admiral of the navy and</v>
<v Speaker 2>also in the joint chiefs of staff</v>

2199
01:45:55.310 --> 01:45:57.390
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Last thing was crow and this guy.</v>

2200
01:45:57.391 --> 01:46:01.060
<v Speaker 2>So you're telling me that dude didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>know that this contract is major bit</v>

2201
01:46:01.080 --> 01:46:05.460
<v Speaker 2>multibillion dollar defense contract</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming down the pipeline and then jumps</v>

2202
01:46:05.461 --> 01:46:08.180
<v Speaker 2>in and buys this company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2203
01:46:08.370 --> 01:46:11.310
<v Speaker 2>to start pumping people with shit that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have no idea.</v>

2204
01:46:11.520 --> 01:46:16.010
<v Speaker 2>And they actually got the lab got shut</v>
<v Speaker 2>down while they're manufacturing all</v>

2205
01:46:16.030 --> 01:46:19.560
<v Speaker 2>this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who knows how many hundreds of thousands</v>

2206
01:46:19.560 --> 01:46:20.430
<v Speaker 2>of people had to put that shit in there</v>

2207
01:46:22.200 --> 01:46:24.370
<v Speaker 3>and they will fucking experiment on</v>
<v Speaker 3>soldiers.</v>

2208
01:46:24.371 --> 01:46:28.570
<v Speaker 3>They have done it in the past is the</v>
<v Speaker 3>precedent has been set a long time go.</v>

2209
01:46:28.600 --> 01:46:30.130
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2210
01:46:30.250 --> 01:46:31.390
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2211
01:46:32.180 --> 01:46:35.500
<v Speaker 2>I remember bootcamp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go down those cattle catalog and</v>

2212
01:46:35.501 --> 01:46:39.070
<v Speaker 2>there's like six people and you just</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep going through and you go through</v>

2213
01:46:39.090 --> 01:46:42.400
<v Speaker 2>with all of these shots,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guns that just.</v>

2214
01:46:42.420 --> 01:46:44.620
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea to this day where a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of it even was.</v>

2215
01:46:44.621 --> 01:46:46.720
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got stationed overseas so we had to</v>

2216
01:46:46.721 --> 01:46:49.890
<v Speaker 2>take a bunch of typhoid and there's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole lot of shit on.</v>

2217
01:46:49.930 --> 01:46:51.320
<v Speaker 2>They don't even tell you what they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>putting in you,</v>

2218
01:46:51.321 --> 01:46:53.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a week.</v>

2219
01:46:53.311 --> 01:46:55.070
<v Speaker 2>You can't lift your arms up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like</v>

2220
01:46:56.370 --> 01:46:57.930
<v Speaker 4>how fucked is that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't have.</v>

2221
01:46:59.020 --> 01:47:00.800
<v Speaker 4>They don't have to tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

2222
01:47:01.080 --> 01:47:06.080
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy that they can just shoot</v>
<v Speaker 4>vaccinations in you and they don't have</v>

2223
01:47:06.091 --> 01:47:06.960
<v Speaker 4>to tell you what they're doing.</v>

2224
01:47:08.580 --> 01:47:11.760
<v Speaker 2>I refused to take them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They put you in prison really?</v>

2225
01:47:13.060 --> 01:47:13.950
<v Speaker 2>Or the brick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2226
01:47:14.030 --> 01:47:16.460
<v Speaker 2>like a lot of guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How long they put you in for until you</v>

2227
01:47:16.740 --> 01:47:20.520
<v Speaker 2>get in new guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was like 90 days restricts</v>

2228
01:47:20.521 --> 01:47:21.354
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2229
01:47:21.800 --> 01:47:23.970
<v Speaker 2>And then they don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll have to shoot you when he get out.</v>

2230
01:47:23.971 --> 01:47:24.720
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2231
01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:25.501
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like that.</v>

2232
01:47:25.501 --> 01:47:26.400
<v Speaker 2>It's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one of those.</v>

2233
01:47:26.460 --> 01:47:28.290
<v Speaker 2>But I mean it was obviously about making</v>
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

2234
01:47:28.500 --> 01:47:30.550
<v Speaker 2>Fuck or no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'm an anthro sale.</v>

2235
01:47:30.551 --> 01:47:33.240
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you get hit with weaponized anthrax</v>

2236
01:47:33.960 --> 01:47:35.760
<v Speaker 2>or you've even if you've been</v>
<v Speaker 2>vaccinated,</v>

2237
01:47:35.890 --> 01:47:38.460
<v Speaker 2>it's a spore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a virus.</v>

2238
01:47:38.610 --> 01:47:40.440
<v Speaker 2>It's going to mutate as soon as it hits</v>
<v Speaker 2>the air.</v>

2239
01:47:41.100 --> 01:47:41.980
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2240
01:47:42.210 --> 01:47:45.720
<v Speaker 2>I guess the argument of the reasoning</v>
<v Speaker 2>was that it might make you live 30 or 40</v>

2241
01:47:45.721 --> 01:47:49.320
<v Speaker 2>extra seconds longer so you can hit the</v>
<v Speaker 2>button to launch some more missiles at</v>

2242
01:47:49.321 --> 01:47:50.610
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the reasoning behind</v>

2243
01:47:50.611 --> 01:47:52.010
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

2244
01:47:52.440 --> 01:47:54.390
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of it was a big deal.</v>

2245
01:47:54.391 --> 01:47:58.200
<v Speaker 2>I remember when that story came out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they found out that the admiral owned</v>

2246
01:47:58.201 --> 01:48:00.660
<v Speaker 2>the company was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a what?</v>

2247
01:48:01.310 --> 01:48:02.730
<v Speaker 2>So crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is illegal.</v>

2248
01:48:03.070 --> 01:48:05.850
<v Speaker 2>It's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if he took the shot,</v>

2249
01:48:06.270 --> 01:48:08.330
<v Speaker 2>I doubt it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wide</v>

2250
01:48:08.600 --> 01:48:13.520
<v Speaker 4>Gulf War Syndrome was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>connected to depleted uranium.</v>

2251
01:48:14.330 --> 01:48:16.910
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it was a several,</v>
<v Speaker 4>several different factors,</v>

2252
01:48:16.950 --> 01:48:20.720
<v Speaker 4>so</v>
<v Speaker 4>many different factors because they know</v>

2253
01:48:20.721 --> 01:48:25.721
<v Speaker 4>that they definitely used depleted</v>
<v Speaker 4>uranium shells as anti tank weapons</v>

2254
01:48:26.180 --> 01:48:28.910
<v Speaker 4>that's been proven and that was</v>
<v Speaker 4>something that they were never supposed</v>

2255
01:48:28.911 --> 01:48:31.010
<v Speaker 4>to use.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the half life on that shit is</v>

2256
01:48:31.011 --> 01:48:33.170
<v Speaker 4>something like 100,000 years or</v>
<v Speaker 4>something nutty.</v>

2257
01:48:33.410 --> 01:48:38.410
<v Speaker 4>So there's these places in Iraq to this</v>
<v Speaker 4>day that are just Foxville from these,</v>

2258
01:48:39.650 --> 01:48:44.510
<v Speaker 4>these depleted uranium shells slamming</v>
<v Speaker 4>into tanks and soldiers would take</v>

2259
01:48:44.511 --> 01:48:47.160
<v Speaker 4>pieces from those tanks as memories,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2260
01:48:47.190 --> 01:48:51.620
<v Speaker 4>they take them home as souvenirs and so</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're carrying something that's highly</v>

2261
01:48:51.621 --> 01:48:55.220
<v Speaker 4>radioactive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like those depleted uranium shells.</v>

2262
01:48:55.221 --> 01:49:00.221
<v Speaker 4>It's laid literally nuclear waste and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they use that as a shell and it just</v>

2263
01:49:00.471 --> 01:49:04.790
<v Speaker 4>goes through everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2264
01:49:04.791 --> 01:49:09.080
<v Speaker 4>you're harnessing the power of the sun,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the blow a hole through a jeep.</v>

2265
01:49:09.620 --> 01:49:11.420
<v Speaker 4>And then these poor fuckers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2266
01:49:11.421 --> 01:49:13.580
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they stumble upon this jeep and nobody</v>

2267
01:49:13.581 --> 01:49:15.770
<v Speaker 4>had told them shit and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey man,</v>

2268
01:49:15.780 --> 01:49:20.000
<v Speaker 4>I take this license plate home.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You shouldn't even be anywhere near</v>

2269
01:49:20.001 --> 01:49:21.890
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You shouldn't even be a mile away from</v>

2270
01:49:21.891 --> 01:49:23.780
<v Speaker 4>that fucking jeep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Meanwhile,</v>

2271
01:49:23.781 --> 01:49:25.310
<v Speaker 4>they're hanging around that God damn</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

2272
01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:27.233
<v Speaker 2>Who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2273
01:49:27.240 --> 01:49:32.240
<v Speaker 2>my grandfather was in the South Pacific</v>
<v Speaker 2>during World War Two and even as an</v>

2274
01:49:33.301 --> 01:49:35.520
<v Speaker 2>older man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he must have gotten something in his</v>

2275
01:49:35.521 --> 01:49:39.000
<v Speaker 2>blood over there because it'd be like</v>
<v Speaker 2>middle of July and he'd be sitting in</v>

2276
01:49:39.001 --> 01:49:42.260
<v Speaker 2>the house with like long johns and</v>
<v Speaker 2>corduroy pants and a flannel shirt on</v>

2277
01:49:42.261 --> 01:49:43.520
<v Speaker 2>and talk about I'm cold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2278
01:49:43.680 --> 01:49:45.960
<v Speaker 2>she's just like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>

2279
01:49:45.961 --> 01:49:48.010
<v Speaker 2>there must have been cemented as nerve</v>
<v Speaker 2>gas</v>

2280
01:49:48.010 --> 01:49:49.020
<v Speaker 4>or.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2281
01:49:49.030 --> 01:49:52.740
<v Speaker 4>maybe even just tropical diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I talked to this,</v>

2282
01:49:53.070 --> 01:49:54.430
<v Speaker 4>this um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>guy.</v>

<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2284
01:49:55.770 --> 01:49:58.180

<v Speaker 4>He's a,</v>

2286
01:50:01.410 --> 01:50:04.990
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>professor I think at the University of</v>

2287
01:50:04.990 --> 01:50:05.823
<v Speaker 4>Houston.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2288
01:50:06.100 --> 01:50:11.100
<v Speaker 4>but he's a specializes in diseases that</v>
<v Speaker 4>people get in tropical climates.</v>

2289
01:50:11.830 --> 01:50:15.040
<v Speaker 4>And he told me that when you look at a</v>
<v Speaker 4>tropical environment,</v>

2290
01:50:15.400 --> 01:50:19.690
<v Speaker 4>100 percent of those people are infected</v>
<v Speaker 4>with some sort of parasite,</v>

2291
01:50:20.450 --> 01:50:23.750
<v Speaker 4>$100 silver built a resistance to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2292
01:50:23.760 --> 01:50:25.210
<v Speaker 4>they just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they or not,</v>

2293
01:50:25.750 --> 01:50:29.770
<v Speaker 4>or they're affected by it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like we were talking about all sorts of</v>

2294
01:50:29.771 --> 01:50:34.600
<v Speaker 4>different moisture born bacterial</v>
<v Speaker 4>diseases that people get from dirty</v>

2295
01:50:34.601 --> 01:50:39.601
<v Speaker 4>water and stuff that you just get from</v>
<v Speaker 4>bugs and you get from the air and</v>

2296
01:50:39.960 --> 01:50:42.060
<v Speaker 4>jungleman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're basically living in a petri dish.</v>

2297
01:50:42.061 --> 01:50:44.860
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You live in a nice shit's coming to life</v>

2298
01:50:44.861 --> 01:50:47.260
<v Speaker 4>every day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2299
01:50:47.261 --> 01:50:49.030
<v Speaker 4>if you think about the jungle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2300
01:50:49.030 --> 01:50:52.750
<v Speaker 4>If you go there and you see all that</v>
<v Speaker 4>vegetation ever around you,</v>

2301
01:50:52.751 --> 01:50:57.751
<v Speaker 4>it's just a life and crickets and bugs</v>
<v Speaker 4>and snakes and spiders and cats at</v>

2302
01:50:57.951 --> 01:51:01.570
<v Speaker 4>fucking sloths and eagles and real</v>
<v Speaker 4>monkeys and shed.</v>

2303
01:51:01.571 --> 01:51:04.570
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there's so much life there that</v>

2304
01:51:04.571 --> 01:51:07.960
<v Speaker 4>it's at a macro level too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's at a micro level,</v>

2305
01:51:08.050 --> 01:51:09.880
<v Speaker 4>like there's life that you're not going</v>
<v Speaker 4>to see.</v>

2306
01:51:10.120 --> 01:51:13.120
<v Speaker 4>It's going to get into your body,</v>
<v Speaker 4>crawling up your asshole right now while</v>

2307
01:51:13.121 --> 01:51:16.690
<v Speaker 4>you're swimming or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eat becomes a part of you.</v>

2308
01:51:17.400 --> 01:51:19.750
<v Speaker 4>Like they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have these parasites that become a</v>

2309
01:51:19.751 --> 01:51:24.220
<v Speaker 4>part of you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A buddy of mine got tricky gnosis foul</v>

2310
01:51:24.280 --> 01:51:25.290
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus.</v>

2311
01:51:25.780 --> 01:51:29.170
<v Speaker 4>He got tricky gnosis from eating a bear</v>
<v Speaker 4>meat that wasn't cooked that well.</v>

2312
01:51:29.171 --> 01:51:30.990
<v Speaker 4>Actually it was on the show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His name is Steven.</v>

2313
01:51:30.991 --> 01:51:34.300
<v Speaker 4>Ellie's a hosted the show called</v>
<v Speaker 4>mediator and he was on the show with a</v>

2314
01:51:34.301 --> 01:51:35.260
<v Speaker 4>bunch of other crew members.</v>

2315
01:51:35.260 --> 01:51:38.080
<v Speaker 4>They all eat this bear and they all</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't cook it.</v>

2316
01:51:38.081 --> 01:51:39.910
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they didn't cook it well enough and they</v>

2317
01:51:39.911 --> 01:51:42.070
<v Speaker 4>were joking about getting trick and</v>
<v Speaker 4>hostess at the time.</v>

2318
01:51:42.071 --> 01:51:46.060
<v Speaker 4>So they all got trick analysis so they</v>
<v Speaker 4>have these little tiny worms,</v>

2319
01:51:46.120 --> 01:51:49.360
<v Speaker 4>these larva that are in their body</v>
<v Speaker 4>forever growing.</v>

2320
01:51:49.720 --> 01:51:50.553
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't grow.</v>

2321
01:51:50.800 --> 01:51:53.680
<v Speaker 4>They just stayed dormant in your body</v>
<v Speaker 4>until someone comes along and say if you</v>

2322
01:51:53.681 --> 01:51:56.920
<v Speaker 4>ate Steven Rinella and you didn't cook</v>
<v Speaker 4>them to 160 degrees,</v>

2323
01:51:57.340 --> 01:52:01.270
<v Speaker 4>you would get tricky gnosis from them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's in him for just.</v>

2324
01:52:01.900 --> 01:52:03.370
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just part of the deal.</v>

2325
01:52:05.250 --> 01:52:08.320
<v Speaker 4>And he said he was like really deathly</v>
<v Speaker 4>sick for like seven days.</v>

2326
01:52:08.350 --> 01:52:11.230
<v Speaker 4>Felt like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you had the flu in pain all the</v>

2327
01:52:11.231 --> 01:52:14.500
<v Speaker 4>time is aching and pain and then it went</v>
<v Speaker 4>away and then it just.</v>

2328
01:52:14.501 --> 01:52:16.720
<v Speaker 4>You just deal with the fact that now you</v>
<v Speaker 4>have a trick analysis.</v>

2329
01:52:18.010 --> 01:52:22.450
<v Speaker 4>But like in these tropical environments,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's tons of people that have all</v>

2330
01:52:22.451 --> 01:52:27.451
<v Speaker 4>sorts of crazy parasites in their body,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dysentery or malaria or any damn yeah.</v>

2331
01:52:28.570 --> 01:52:31.210
<v Speaker 4>And in some parasites,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're just starting to now understand</v>

2332
01:52:31.480 --> 01:52:34.390
<v Speaker 4>this parasites that affect behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there's some shit called</v>

2333
01:52:34.391 --> 01:52:36.880
<v Speaker 4>toxoplasmosis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You heard of that one.</v>

2334
01:52:36.910 --> 01:52:40.960
<v Speaker 4>The cat parents plasmosis get you</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking die from smelling bird shit,</v>

2335
01:52:42.460 --> 01:52:44.680
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the creepiest stories I've ever</v>

2336
01:52:44.681 --> 01:52:47.600
<v Speaker 4>heard was guys in Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were standing in front of a cave</v>

2337
01:52:48.050 --> 01:52:50.990
<v Speaker 4>thing was Africa and they were standing</v>
<v Speaker 4>in front of a cave and there were</v>

2338
01:52:50.991 --> 01:52:54.770
<v Speaker 4>scientists and they wanted to photograph</v>
<v Speaker 4>these birds fly.</v>

2339
01:52:54.771 --> 01:52:57.650
<v Speaker 4>Are these bats rather flying out of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>cave when they would go out at night</v>

2340
01:52:57.651 --> 01:53:02.150
<v Speaker 4>because you know the bats leave caves</v>
<v Speaker 4>and mass and there was millions of bats,</v>

2341
01:53:02.151 --> 01:53:05.900
<v Speaker 4>literally millions of bats in this cave.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so they parked out in front of this</v>

2342
01:53:05.901 --> 01:53:09.770
<v Speaker 4>cave,</v>
<v Speaker 4>set up the calls and shit to shit on.</v>

2343
01:53:09.920 --> 01:53:13.970
<v Speaker 4>That's what they didn't anticipate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All the flying out of the shit on.</v>

2344
01:53:14.030 --> 01:53:16.790
<v Speaker 4>And they got deathly ill and they were</v>
<v Speaker 4>dead within weeks.</v>

2345
01:53:17.480 --> 01:53:19.120
<v Speaker 4>Both guys died.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They died.</v>

2346
01:53:19.130 --> 01:53:22.880
<v Speaker 4>This whole thing on tv about the dive</v>
<v Speaker 4>viruses,</v>

2347
01:53:23.060 --> 01:53:25.520
<v Speaker 4>which means they start bleeding on their</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking eyeballs.</v>

2348
01:53:27.960 --> 01:53:30.260
<v Speaker 2>That's what you get for going and</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at in bat caves,</v>

2349
01:53:30.261 --> 01:53:31.240
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2352
01:53:35.980 --> 01:53:39.370
<v Speaker 4>Definitely don't eat it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it gets in your skin like you can't</v>

2353
01:53:39.400 --> 01:53:43.030
<v Speaker 4>have that shit on your skin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can get sick just from it contacting</v>

<v Speaker 4>I'd want to.</v>

2356
01:53:50.380 --> 01:53:55.360
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh Man.</v>

2357
01:53:55.660 --> 01:53:59.230
<v Speaker 4>There's so many parts of the world where</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's so much life and that life is so</v>

2358
01:53:59.231 --> 01:54:02.770
<v Speaker 4>much more dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're just so used to life being like,</v>

2359
01:54:02.800 --> 01:54:04.960
<v Speaker 4>oh look at the squirrel.</v>

<v Speaker 4>So cute.</v>

2361
01:54:07.470 --> 01:54:11.520
<v Speaker 2>But you always hear about these people</v>
<v Speaker 2>like talking about going down to Ecuador</v>

2362
01:54:11.521 --> 01:54:14.100
<v Speaker 2>and Peru to do.</v>

<v Speaker 2>jungle with those bugs and caterpillars</v>
<v Speaker 2>and shit.</v>

2365
01:54:19.230 --> 01:54:22.620
<v Speaker 2>Snakes crawling up my leg.</v>

2366
01:54:22.621 --> 01:54:24.300
<v Speaker 2>is going to the jungle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>

2405
01:55:56.820 --> 01:55:58.800
<v Speaker 3>Less.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Drought did all his own shit.</v>

2406
01:55:58.830 --> 01:56:01.680
<v Speaker 3>He went by himself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He put himself in dangerous situations.</v>

2407
01:56:01.681 --> 01:56:05.250
<v Speaker 3>He lost tons of weight on camera,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whereas literally starving to death,</v>

2408
01:56:05.460 --> 01:56:09.120
<v Speaker 3>he documented the entire thing in 100</v>
<v Speaker 3>percent by himself.</v>

2409
01:56:09.240 --> 01:56:12.810
<v Speaker 3>Encounters with wild animals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like really dangerous situations.</v>

2410
01:56:13.210 --> 01:56:15.420
<v Speaker 3>Almost starving to death,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost freezing to death,</v>

2411
01:56:15.421 --> 01:56:19.050
<v Speaker 3>having to make fire on your own and</v>
<v Speaker 3>going there with a very limited amount</v>

2412
01:56:19.051 --> 01:56:21.060
<v Speaker 3>of things to keep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you would go there with like a</v>

2413
01:56:21.061 --> 01:56:23.040
<v Speaker 3>pocket knife.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll allow themselves some string that</v>

2414
01:56:23.041 --> 01:56:26.640
<v Speaker 3>he could go fishing with go and he would</v>
<v Speaker 3>stay for seven days and have a dropoff</v>

2415
01:56:26.641 --> 01:56:30.090
<v Speaker 3>point where they would drop them off and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it pick up point and if he didn't</v>

2416
01:56:30.091 --> 01:56:32.130
<v Speaker 3>go to the pickup point and they didn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to go looking for them,</v>

2417
01:56:32.550 --> 01:56:37.550
<v Speaker 3>but they wanted to fake stuff and bear</v>
<v Speaker 3>bear grylls filled that gap because les</v>

2418
01:56:38.221 --> 01:56:39.054
<v Speaker 3>whitten fake anything.</v>

2419
01:56:39.270 --> 01:56:39.781
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2420
01:56:39.781 --> 01:56:43.650
<v Speaker 3>we not bringing a camera crew because</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it's not me by myself that you lose</v>

2421
01:56:43.651 --> 01:56:48.270
<v Speaker 3>all of what makes the show special.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what he did is just a bunch of things</v>

2422
01:56:48.271 --> 01:56:51.930
<v Speaker 3>that they set up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if I found these sheep,</v>

2423
01:56:52.070 --> 01:56:54.420
<v Speaker 3>I could take it and make a coat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2424
01:56:54.421 --> 01:56:56.550
<v Speaker 3>like the shit they put the sheep there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they killed the sheep,</v>

2425
01:56:56.880 --> 01:57:00.750
<v Speaker 3>they did it for them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I keep doing all these stunts,</v>

2426
01:57:00.751 --> 01:57:04.840
<v Speaker 3>like jumping from tree to tree and</v>
<v Speaker 3>unnecessarily hanging out with hippo is</v>

2427
01:57:04.950 --> 01:57:08.280
<v Speaker 3>this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No Steve Black Shawl.</v>

2428
01:57:08.281 --> 01:57:13.281
<v Speaker 3>I can't find a Steve Bowles's last name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ray mears premier's just guys hanging</v>

2429
01:57:14.881 --> 01:57:19.200
<v Speaker 3>out with hippos because that guy's</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying ray mears,</v>

2430
01:57:19.730 --> 01:57:22.890
<v Speaker 3>gangs for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a show called Carter's war and</v>

2431
01:57:22.900 --> 01:57:27.900
<v Speaker 3>it's this show about this guy who is an</v>
<v Speaker 3>anti anti poaching official in Africa</v>

2432
01:57:31.620 --> 01:57:35.190
<v Speaker 3>and he tries to prevent them from</v>
<v Speaker 3>poaching all these animals.</v>

2433
01:57:35.310 --> 01:57:40.310
<v Speaker 3>A lot of it is for the Asian market,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for Rhino Horn and a bunch of these</v>

2434
01:57:40.801 --> 01:57:45.450
<v Speaker 3>different animals that they want like</v>
<v Speaker 3>ivory and Rhino Horn is a big one</v>

2435
01:57:45.451 --> 01:57:47.430
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They keep finding these rhinos murdered</v>

2436
01:57:47.431 --> 01:57:48.720
<v Speaker 3>with their horns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hacked off.</v>

2437
01:57:49.290 --> 01:57:51.360
<v Speaker 3>It's a fucking sobering show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2438
01:57:51.570 --> 01:57:52.590
<v Speaker 3>for two reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One,</v>

2439
01:57:52.591 --> 01:57:54.720
<v Speaker 3>because you see what people are willing</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do.</v>

2440
01:57:54.721 --> 01:57:57.750
<v Speaker 3>These animals just shoot them in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>head and cut their horns off and cut</v>

2441
01:57:57.930 --> 01:58:00.050
<v Speaker 3>half their face off like a chainsaw and</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

2442
01:58:00.060 --> 01:58:04.230
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then also you see how fucking poor</v>

2443
01:58:04.231 --> 01:58:08.310
<v Speaker 3>these people are and then you realize</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they of course they're going to do</v>

2444
01:58:08.311 --> 01:58:10.560
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if they can shoot that rhino and</v>

2445
01:58:10.561 --> 01:58:14.790
<v Speaker 3>make $50,000 from its magic corn or</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever the fuck they make,</v>

2446
01:58:14.820 --> 01:58:16.760
<v Speaker 3>they probably make 50 bucks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2447
01:58:17.010 --> 01:58:20.280
<v Speaker 3>But if they can make that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's between them starving and not</v>

2448
01:58:20.281 --> 01:58:22.200
<v Speaker 3>starving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that's literally what you're</v>

2449
01:58:22.201 --> 01:58:26.910
<v Speaker 3>looking at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything subjective.</v>

2450
01:58:27.030 --> 01:58:30.300
<v Speaker 3>Just the gentlemen that's him shows</v>
<v Speaker 3>called Bushcraft,</v>

2451
01:58:30.320 --> 01:58:32.820
<v Speaker 3>those crafts hanging out with a wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at this motherfucker.</v>

2452
01:58:33.210 --> 01:58:35.200
<v Speaker 3>He knows the wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

2453
01:58:35.250 --> 01:58:38.400
<v Speaker 3>he's like the most unassuming guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's so bad ass dude.</v>

2454
01:58:38.550 --> 01:58:40.530
<v Speaker 3>It's called bushcraft.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bushcraft.</v>

2455
01:58:40.590 --> 01:58:41.890
<v Speaker 3>Is it an English show or an</v>

2456
01:58:42.010 --> 01:58:45.430
<v Speaker 1>Australia on the BBC I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man.</v>

2457
01:58:46.670 --> 01:58:47.503
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2458
01:58:48.060 --> 01:58:50.100
<v Speaker 1>Doodle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just walk out in the woods with nothing</v>

2459
01:58:50.101 --> 01:58:53.440
<v Speaker 1>but a damn or there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there a fish</v>

2460
01:58:56.340 --> 01:58:59.060
<v Speaker 1>with like some piece of meat or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something they got.</v>

2461
01:58:59.490 --> 01:59:02.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These guys that are into like surviving</v>

2462
01:59:02.521 --> 01:59:05.160
<v Speaker 1>on their own like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They take great pleasure with that.</v>

2463
01:59:05.161 --> 01:59:08.590
<v Speaker 1>They're always fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess he's really naturalist to like</v>

2464
01:59:08.640 --> 01:59:12.810
<v Speaker 1>Fanta and natural vegetation and finding</v>
<v Speaker 1>forging food on your own that contains a</v>

2465
01:59:12.811 --> 01:59:15.210
<v Speaker 1>lot more useful information than just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2466
01:59:15.960 --> 01:59:19.470
<v Speaker 1>you got three days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drink your pis and don't get eaten by</v>

2467
01:59:19.471 --> 01:59:22.640
<v Speaker 1>the alligator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like no man will.</v>

2468
01:59:22.650 --> 01:59:25.350
<v Speaker 1>Survivor man came up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>came up with all that on his own.</v>

2469
01:59:25.620 --> 01:59:28.920
<v Speaker 1>His concept,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he was actually living in the</v>

2470
01:59:28.921 --> 01:59:33.270
<v Speaker 1>forest with his pregnant wife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The two of them,</v>

2471
01:59:33.290 --> 01:59:36.270
<v Speaker 1>they are by themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he was a younger man,</v>

2472
01:59:36.271 --> 01:59:38.730
<v Speaker 1>like he did this on his own before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2473
01:59:38.820 --> 01:59:41.400
<v Speaker 1>before he was famous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he's been doing this forever.</v>

2474
01:59:41.550 --> 01:59:43.290
<v Speaker 1>What's his background?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where do you learn it all?</v>

2475
01:59:43.460 --> 01:59:44.281
<v Speaker 1>He just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2476
01:59:44.281 --> 01:59:44.460
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2477
01:59:44.460 --> 01:59:46.170
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He told me I forgot.</v>

2478
01:59:47.370 --> 01:59:52.370
<v Speaker 1>I think he just learned to read a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering for those 30 minutes of</v>

2479
01:59:53.401 --> 01:59:56.970
<v Speaker 1>viewing entertainment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got this wacky thing he's doing now</v>

2480
01:59:56.971 --> 02:00:00.200
<v Speaker 1>and always looking for bigfoot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got a survivor man.</v>

2481
02:00:00.230 --> 02:00:02.250
<v Speaker 1>Big Foot is like the biggest thing since</v>
<v Speaker 1>sliced bread.</v>

2482
02:00:02.310 --> 02:00:04.620
<v Speaker 1>Leavenworth Washington.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where he is.</v>

2483
02:00:05.410 --> 02:00:06.450
<v Speaker 1>Do you see him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2484
02:00:06.451 --> 02:00:08.660
<v Speaker 1>so when we got a cup of coffee on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>road one day,</v>

2485
02:00:08.680 --> 02:00:11.820
<v Speaker 1>this lady had a whole photo album full</v>
<v Speaker 1>of pictures of bigfoot in her backyard.</v>

2486
02:00:13.520 --> 02:00:16.140
<v Speaker 1>It looked like some bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like our neighbor jacket off.</v>

2487
02:00:19.560 --> 02:00:24.560
<v Speaker 1>She's selling coffee though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked to One lady when I was doing</v>

2488
02:00:25.261 --> 02:00:26.520
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Scifi show.</v>

2489
02:00:26.540 --> 02:00:30.810
<v Speaker 1>We did a whole episode on bigfoot one</v>
<v Speaker 1>lady that I really believe saw something</v>

2490
02:00:30.880 --> 02:00:34.500
<v Speaker 1>a really believe she did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I think she probably saw was a</v>

2491
02:00:34.501 --> 02:00:37.530
<v Speaker 1>black bear because black players walk on</v>
<v Speaker 1>their hind legs.</v>

2492
02:00:37.780 --> 02:00:39.750
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's video of black bears walk in</v>

2493
02:00:39.751 --> 02:00:43.920
<v Speaker 1>like 100 yards from her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was very earnest and what she was</v>

2494
02:00:43.921 --> 02:00:46.290
<v Speaker 1>talking about and was sensational in</v>
<v Speaker 1>any,</v>

2495
02:00:46.291 --> 02:00:47.970
<v Speaker 1>in any way at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What she was telling me,</v>

2496
02:00:47.971 --> 02:00:49.770
<v Speaker 1>it was pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty straightforward.</v>

2497
02:00:49.950 --> 02:00:53.850
<v Speaker 1>And I also believe her because there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>black bears in that area.</v>

2498
02:00:54.630 --> 02:00:58.380
<v Speaker 1>It's incredibly densely wooded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the area that she's talking about</v>

2499
02:00:58.381 --> 02:01:01.580
<v Speaker 1>was the Pacific northwest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah man.</v>

2500
02:01:02.280 --> 02:01:03.920
<v Speaker 1>I guess Mount Rainier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mt.</v>

2501
02:01:03.920 --> 02:01:05.040
<v Speaker 1>Rainier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right outside of Washington,</v>

2502
02:01:05.410 --> 02:01:08.100
<v Speaker 1>right outside of Seattle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's gorgeous.</v>

2503
02:01:08.300 --> 02:01:12.060
<v Speaker 1>Big Harry fucked her is real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the only place he could possibly</v>

2504
02:01:12.061 --> 02:01:15.270
<v Speaker 1>exist because you could absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 1>disappeared in that forest.</v>

2505
02:01:15.380 --> 02:01:16.740
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's some dense,</v>

2506
02:01:17.640 --> 02:01:22.640
<v Speaker 1>dense wilderness and filled with food</v>
<v Speaker 1>filled with food filled with wildly</v>

2507
02:01:23.660 --> 02:01:25.370
<v Speaker 1>known me saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe in bigfoot.</v>

2508
02:01:25.620 --> 02:01:27.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

2509
02:01:27.810 --> 02:01:30.930
<v Speaker 1>you're 100 percent correct though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there was an animal like that,</v>

2510
02:01:30.990 --> 02:01:34.230
<v Speaker 1>that would be the spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It also would be the spot because that's</v>

2511
02:01:34.231 --> 02:01:36.870
<v Speaker 1>the spot where it would make sense</v>
<v Speaker 1>geographically.</v>

2512
02:01:37.140 --> 02:01:40.010
<v Speaker 1>My feeling is what I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet</v>

2513
02:01:40.010 --> 02:01:43.430
<v Speaker 4>it used to be real because at one point</v>
<v Speaker 4>in time there was a thing called</v>

2514
02:01:43.431 --> 02:01:48.020
<v Speaker 4>gigantic pithy kiss that lived in Asia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was as recently as 100,000 years ago,</v>

2515
02:01:48.380 --> 02:01:52.070
<v Speaker 4>which is not that long and that was when</v>
<v Speaker 4>the bering strait was connected,</v>

2516
02:01:52.250 --> 02:01:56.900
<v Speaker 4>so Asia and the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could actually walk from Asia to the</v>

2517
02:01:56.900 --> 02:02:00.410
<v Speaker 4>United States that the land mass was in</v>
<v Speaker 4>place and the ice age and was all frozen</v>

2518
02:02:00.411 --> 02:02:02.720
<v Speaker 4>over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So during that time it would have been</v>

2519
02:02:02.780 --> 02:02:07.580
<v Speaker 4>entirely possible because so many native</v>
<v Speaker 4>American cultures have names for that</v>

2520
02:02:07.581 --> 02:02:11.810
<v Speaker 4>animal to have names for this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like man that lives in the forest is</v>

2521
02:02:13.010 --> 02:02:17.450
<v Speaker 4>how's the same legend on the other side</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the world about some crazy well,</v>

2522
02:02:17.451 --> 02:02:19.080
<v Speaker 4>and it was real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2523
02:02:19.220 --> 02:02:22.100
<v Speaker 4>And then also on top of that thing being</v>
<v Speaker 4>real.</v>

2524
02:02:22.220 --> 02:02:25.520
<v Speaker 4>They also know that there was those</v>
<v Speaker 4>little hobbit people in the island of</v>

2525
02:02:25.521 --> 02:02:30.521
<v Speaker 4>Flores and there's a theory about that</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing is that it's either the most</v>

2526
02:02:30.831 --> 02:02:31.370
<v Speaker 4>recent one.</v>

2527
02:02:31.370 --> 02:02:35.750
<v Speaker 4>They think that it might've been as</v>
<v Speaker 4>recently as 50,000 years ago,</v>

2528
02:02:35.751 --> 02:02:39.200
<v Speaker 4>but I think they thought it was like</v>
<v Speaker 4>14,000 years ago until recently.</v>

2529
02:02:39.230 --> 02:02:41.300
<v Speaker 4>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a bear dude.</v>

2530
02:02:41.570 --> 02:02:43.280
<v Speaker 4>That is a bear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at that.</v>

2531
02:02:43.640 --> 02:02:48.640
<v Speaker 4>That's a real legit black bear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So imagine if you saw that for sure.</v>

2532
02:02:48.891 --> 02:02:50.250
<v Speaker 4>That's big fish.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that last little.</v>

2533
02:02:51.200 --> 02:02:55.400
<v Speaker 4>See when bears hurt there Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if they get bitten in there,</v>

2534
02:02:55.401 --> 02:02:59.090
<v Speaker 4>Paul and their pod gets infected.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can walk on their back legs and</v>

2535
02:02:59.091 --> 02:03:02.890
<v Speaker 4>they can do it for hundreds of yards.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I think she saw that just when you</v>

2536
02:03:02.891 --> 02:03:06.160
<v Speaker 4>thought they couldn't get any scarier.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a bunch of videos of bear's</v>

2537
02:03:06.180 --> 02:03:08.360
<v Speaker 4>doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not just that one bear.</v>

2538
02:03:08.390 --> 02:03:10.640
<v Speaker 4>So there's a lot of evidence that bears</v>
<v Speaker 4>walk like that.</v>

2539
02:03:10.970 --> 02:03:14.840
<v Speaker 4>So this one lady that I talked to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I bet she saw a black bear that was</v>

2540
02:03:14.841 --> 02:03:15.560
<v Speaker 4>walking on time.</v>

2541
02:03:15.560 --> 02:03:16.281
<v Speaker 4>Legs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what.</v>

2542
02:03:16.281 --> 02:03:17.900
<v Speaker 4>I bet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It only makes sense.</v>

2543
02:03:18.890 --> 02:03:20.840
<v Speaker 4>You can't see anything in there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anyway,</v>

2544
02:03:21.170 --> 02:03:25.160
<v Speaker 4>that's the thing about those woods.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You lived up there right in the car for</v>

2545
02:03:25.161 --> 02:03:25.994
<v Speaker 4>a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2546
02:03:26.070 --> 02:03:28.190
<v Speaker 4>You can't see shit in those woods.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

2547
02:03:28.250 --> 02:03:32.480
<v Speaker 4>We used to go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just look a little weird Swiss mountain</v>

2548
02:03:32.481 --> 02:03:34.640
<v Speaker 4>ski town called Living Worth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

2549
02:03:34.641 --> 02:03:36.980
<v Speaker 4>a buddy of mine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We drove through on our way to Vancouver</v>

2550
02:03:37.070 --> 02:03:39.980
<v Speaker 4>to go party and there was another,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was like farther east,</v>

2551
02:03:39.981 --> 02:03:41.120
<v Speaker 4>I think it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2552
02:03:41.140 --> 02:03:42.920
<v Speaker 4>in the middle of nothing man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just trees.</v>

2553
02:03:44.680 --> 02:03:47.360
<v Speaker 4>You could,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could just walk off into it and</v>

2554
02:03:47.361 --> 02:03:49.670
<v Speaker 4>disappear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well less.</v>

2555
02:03:49.730 --> 02:03:53.170
<v Speaker 4>When he was camping,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was doing an episode of survivor and</v>

2556
02:03:53.190 --> 02:03:58.190
<v Speaker 4>it was up in Alaska and he says that he</v>
<v Speaker 4>heard some noise outside of his tent and</v>

2557
02:04:01.671 --> 02:04:02.930
<v Speaker 4>he barely moved.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he didn't,</v>

2558
02:04:02.960 --> 02:04:05.420
<v Speaker 4>he didn't want to move.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We wanted to see if he could get his</v>

2559
02:04:05.421 --> 02:04:09.590
<v Speaker 4>camera and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>try to record this and he heard</v>

2560
02:04:09.591 --> 02:04:11.940
<v Speaker 4>something that sounded like a primate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something like</v>

2561
02:04:13.510 --> 02:04:18.510
<v Speaker 4>made like some primate type noise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then when he went to open up his</v>

2562
02:04:18.801 --> 02:04:20.840
<v Speaker 4>tent and look outside,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the thing took off,</v>

2563
02:04:21.050 --> 02:04:23.660
<v Speaker 4>took off running.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he said it sounded like bipedal</v>

2564
02:04:23.661 --> 02:04:25.250
<v Speaker 4>footprints.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go large,</v>

2565
02:04:25.280 --> 02:04:26.690
<v Speaker 4>heavy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bipedal thing.</v>

2566
02:04:27.320 --> 02:04:31.190
<v Speaker 4>The problem is I've heard bears make</v>
<v Speaker 4>that kind of sound.</v>

2567
02:04:31.250 --> 02:04:34.490
<v Speaker 4>I've heard them personally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>seen them with my eyes fighting with</v>

2568
02:04:34.491 --> 02:04:38.280
<v Speaker 4>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They they make like</v>

2569
02:04:38.550 --> 02:04:43.550
<v Speaker 1>a almost like a gorilla and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>attacking each other and they were</v>

2570
02:04:45.060 --> 02:04:48.840
<v Speaker 1>making this crazy noise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a mother trying to keep a male</v>

2571
02:04:48.841 --> 02:04:51.380
<v Speaker 1>bear away from her cubs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she was.</v>

2572
02:04:51.450 --> 02:04:53.310
<v Speaker 1>They fought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They fought right in front of us,</v>

2573
02:04:53.370 --> 02:04:56.520
<v Speaker 1>like within a hundred yards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched him duke it out,</v>

2574
02:04:56.670 --> 02:05:00.770
<v Speaker 1>UFC style Alberta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was watching it go down.</v>

2575
02:05:01.740 --> 02:05:06.740
<v Speaker 1>So I've heard bears make like a monkey</v>
<v Speaker 1>sound that makes much more practical</v>

2576
02:05:06.751 --> 02:05:11.751
<v Speaker 1>sense to me than a seven foot tall</v>
<v Speaker 1>chewbacca that no one's ever seemed to</v>

2577
02:05:12.451 --> 02:05:14.670
<v Speaker 1>be able to play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eyes are more hands on,</v>

2578
02:05:14.860 --> 02:05:18.540
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well we got drones now,</v>

2579
02:05:18.541 --> 02:05:20.310
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to believe so bad.</v>

2580
02:05:20.970 --> 02:05:24.150
<v Speaker 1>That's why the one thing I want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe in bigfoot almost as much as</v>

2581
02:05:24.151 --> 02:05:29.040
<v Speaker 1>aliens as Ufo reports,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aliens and Ufo is like the one that's</v>

2582
02:05:29.041 --> 02:05:31.770
<v Speaker 1>the one two punch for what you want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe in,</v>

2583
02:05:33.900 --> 02:05:36.000
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2584
02:05:36.150 --> 02:05:38.770
<v Speaker 1>Other than love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that too.</v>

2585
02:05:41.450 --> 02:05:43.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't want to go down that rabbit</v>

2586
02:05:43.501 --> 02:05:44.390
<v Speaker 1>hole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2587
02:05:44.520 --> 02:05:47.580
<v Speaker 1>black holes and infinite multi versus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2588
02:05:47.581 --> 02:05:47.940
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2589
02:05:47.940 --> 02:05:51.180
<v Speaker 1>without a doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go to school out there that were</v>

2590
02:05:51.181 --> 02:05:52.050
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2591
02:05:52.290 --> 02:05:54.660
<v Speaker 1>I guess the question is why would they</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking care?</v>

2592
02:05:55.530 --> 02:05:57.450
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe they do.</v>

2593
02:05:57.451 --> 02:05:59.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe this is pretty interesting.</v>

2594
02:05:59.160 --> 02:06:01.170
<v Speaker 1>I'd watch it for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2595
02:06:01.171 --> 02:06:01.561
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2596
02:06:01.561 --> 02:06:03.490
<v Speaker 1>We studied turtles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2597
02:06:03.720 --> 02:06:06.330
<v Speaker 1>dudes traveled to the jungle to study of</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking butterfly.</v>

2598
02:06:06.690 --> 02:06:08.820
<v Speaker 1>Some heavy stuff going on the back of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>turtle.</v>

2599
02:06:08.821 --> 02:06:09.960
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

2600
02:06:10.260 --> 02:06:11.970
<v Speaker 1>Not to demean turtles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

2601
02:06:11.971 --> 02:06:13.740
<v Speaker 1>if turtles were on the moon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

2602
02:06:13.741 --> 02:06:17.520
<v Speaker 1>we'd be flying jets to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to visit the oldest known species on</v>

2603
02:06:17.521 --> 02:06:19.530
<v Speaker 1>earth day crocodiles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

2604
02:06:21.220 --> 02:06:22.670
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2605
02:06:22.920 --> 02:06:25.920
<v Speaker 1>Turtles been around longer than any</v>
<v Speaker 1>other living creature on the planet.</v>

2606
02:06:26.660 --> 02:06:27.570
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2607
02:06:27.750 --> 02:06:30.540
<v Speaker 1>nail clippers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They never had to make them any better.</v>

2608
02:06:31.060 --> 02:06:32.400
<v Speaker 1>That's perfect design.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2609
02:06:32.410 --> 02:06:34.590
<v Speaker 1>Like when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nail clippers are exactly the same.</v>

2610
02:06:35.190 --> 02:06:36.060
<v Speaker 1>They haven't done anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2611
02:06:36.061 --> 02:06:40.050
<v Speaker 1>they made better can openers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've made a better tupperware.</v>

2612
02:06:40.490 --> 02:06:45.490
<v Speaker 1>They've improved almost every aspect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess steak knives are pretty much the</v>

2613
02:06:45.901 --> 02:06:48.720
<v Speaker 1>same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even even the number of,</v>

2614
02:06:48.721 --> 02:06:50.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>

2615
02:06:51.170 --> 02:06:52.110
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Shill,</v>

2616
02:06:52.350 --> 02:06:52.891
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2617
02:06:52.891 --> 02:06:53.650
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2618
02:06:53.650 --> 02:06:55.560
<v Speaker 1>like the symmetrical patterns of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoulders.</v>

2619
02:06:55.561 --> 02:06:58.020
<v Speaker 1>13,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter how big are they are small.</v>

2620
02:06:58.680 --> 02:07:02.610
<v Speaker 1>So like all Indians believe that that</v>
<v Speaker 1>coincided with the 13 lunar cycles of</v>

2621
02:07:02.611 --> 02:07:04.490
<v Speaker 1>the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2622
02:07:04.920 --> 02:07:06.960
<v Speaker 1>I made a whole album cover all about</v>
<v Speaker 1>this shit.</v>

2623
02:07:06.961 --> 02:07:09.330
<v Speaker 1>I was just letting you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guys like how weird can we get with</v>

2624
02:07:09.331 --> 02:07:14.331
<v Speaker 1>this thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just make the tackiest record cover ever</v>

2625
02:07:14.700 --> 02:07:18.540
<v Speaker 1>day are a very fascinating creature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean anytime you see patterns like</v>

2626
02:07:18.541 --> 02:07:21.270
<v Speaker 1>even like a Nautilus Shell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see these patterns,</v>

2627
02:07:21.271 --> 02:07:24.060
<v Speaker 1>these repeating patterns that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals have.</v>

2628
02:07:24.840 --> 02:07:25.471
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2629
02:07:25.471 --> 02:07:27.090
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well why is there as some sort of a</v>

2630
02:07:27.091 --> 02:07:29.640
<v Speaker 1>geometric pattern into this animal's</v>
<v Speaker 1>design?</v>

2631
02:07:30.800 --> 02:07:34.110
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost fractal.</v>

2632
02:07:34.111 --> 02:07:34.691
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2633
02:07:34.691 --> 02:07:35.380
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

2634
02:07:35.380 --> 02:07:36.280
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a FIBONACCI</v>

2635
02:07:36.280 --> 02:07:39.430
<v Speaker 3>sequence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The FIBONACCI sequence manifests itself</v>

2636
02:07:39.431 --> 02:07:41.950
<v Speaker 3>in like sunflowers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they say,</v>

2637
02:07:41.951 --> 02:07:45.070
<v Speaker 3>like if you look at a pine cone on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>FIBONACCI sequences in a pine cone,</v>

2638
02:07:45.370 --> 02:07:48.520
<v Speaker 3>meaning that it's a sequence of numbers</v>
<v Speaker 3>like zero.</v>

2639
02:07:48.521 --> 02:07:52.210
<v Speaker 3>And then there's one and then there's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there's two and one plus two.</v>

2640
02:07:52.490 --> 02:07:54.670
<v Speaker 3>There's three and three plus two is</v>
<v Speaker 3>five,</v>

2641
02:07:54.671 --> 02:07:59.200
<v Speaker 3>and the five plus three is eight and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>keeps going on and on and on,</v>

2642
02:07:59.590 --> 02:08:04.590
<v Speaker 3>and it's this exponential equation and</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're adding all those things up,</v>

2643
02:08:06.160 --> 02:08:11.160
<v Speaker 3>that same sequence can be found in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>shape of people's faces and honeycombs</v>

2644
02:08:11.441 --> 02:08:14.230
<v Speaker 3>and a bunch of different designs like</v>
<v Speaker 3>pine cones.</v>

2645
02:08:14.231 --> 02:08:16.120
<v Speaker 3>There's very.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See Jamie's got some stuff.</v>

2646
02:08:16.121 --> 02:08:19.150
<v Speaker 3>They pull up a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The FIBONACCI numbers in nature.</v>

2647
02:08:19.151 --> 02:08:21.700
<v Speaker 3>There's this crazy green fruit that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>always at my,</v>

2648
02:08:21.750 --> 02:08:23.440
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>might be a vegetable.</v>

2649
02:08:23.441 --> 02:08:26.620
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is that fucking thing that fruit?</v>

2650
02:08:26.620 --> 02:08:28.120
<v Speaker 3>Broccoli?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does it.</v>

2651
02:08:28.121 --> 02:08:30.310
<v Speaker 3>Romanesque Broccoli,</v>
<v Speaker 3>romanesque Broccoli.</v>

2652
02:08:30.400 --> 02:08:33.570
<v Speaker 3>It's like the DMT fruit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when you look at that,</v>

2653
02:08:33.571 --> 02:08:38.571
<v Speaker 3>like that is fractal geometry in fruit</v>
<v Speaker 3>form or in vegetable form or other</v>

2654
02:08:40.960 --> 02:08:43.030
<v Speaker 3>really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's the FIBONACCI sequence.</v>

2655
02:08:43.031 --> 02:08:47.310
<v Speaker 3>Like if you go to the very top and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>see how small it is and then it as it</v>

2656
02:08:47.500 --> 02:08:50.620
<v Speaker 3>tapers down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it gets larger and the numbers all</v>

2657
02:08:50.621 --> 02:08:53.140
<v Speaker 3>exponentially increased.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just so fascinating.</v>

2658
02:08:53.380 --> 02:08:54.640
<v Speaker 3>Tool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2659
02:08:55.630 --> 02:09:00.280
<v Speaker 3>Was of a music.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The band when I was younger,</v>

2660
02:09:00.820 --> 02:09:01.480
<v Speaker 3>do you know that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2661
02:09:01.480 --> 02:09:04.450
<v Speaker 3>maynard key is going to fight Ronda</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rousey and an MMA match.</v>

2662
02:09:05.670 --> 02:09:07.020
<v Speaker 3>Did Not know that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Knew He.</v>

2663
02:09:07.210 --> 02:09:08.910
<v Speaker 3>When he loses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's getting an exchange.</v>

2664
02:09:11.500 --> 02:09:12.700
<v Speaker 3>You're bullshitting me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>

2665
02:09:12.701 --> 02:09:14.650
<v Speaker 3>I am trying to help spread a rumor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Awesome.</v>

2666
02:09:15.250 --> 02:09:16.840
<v Speaker 3>I'll show you some pictures afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He does.</v>

2667
02:09:17.050 --> 02:09:20.020
<v Speaker 3>Is he like a Jujitsu Guy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe he's got his purple belt.</v>

2668
02:09:20.050 --> 02:09:22.480
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure he goes about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's very dedicated.</v>

2669
02:09:22.630 --> 02:09:24.940
<v Speaker 3>He's so dedicated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got a hip replacement and went back</v>

2670
02:09:24.941 --> 02:09:28.270
<v Speaker 3>to training.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But here it goes.</v>

2671
02:09:28.840 --> 02:09:33.840
<v Speaker 3>Five Rhonda Rogers Kit that look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Awesome.</v>

2672
02:09:34.690 --> 02:09:35.523
<v Speaker 3>He's a fucking</v>

2673
02:09:35.580 --> 02:09:36.840
<v Speaker 2>character.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that dude.</v>

2674
02:09:37.090 --> 02:09:38.240
<v Speaker 2>Ever him?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2675
02:09:38.250 --> 02:09:39.540
<v Speaker 2>Hung out with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really cool.</v>

2676
02:09:39.550 --> 02:09:41.610
<v Speaker 2>He's been on the show a couple times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a good dude.</v>

2677
02:09:42.570 --> 02:09:44.240
<v Speaker 2>Was one of my lyricist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2678
02:09:44.310 --> 02:09:45.143
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a really.</v>

2679
02:09:45.570 --> 02:09:48.390
<v Speaker 2>When I lived out there and he was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little kinds of music I just discovered</v>

2680
02:09:48.391 --> 02:09:50.040
<v Speaker 2>that I probably never would have gotten</v>
<v Speaker 2>into otherwise.</v>

2681
02:09:50.041 --> 02:09:54.900
<v Speaker 2>And that band I really like had a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>phase lyrically speaking.</v>

2682
02:09:54.901 --> 02:09:58.650
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was some of the more</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cathartic and kind of start donek stuff</v>

2683
02:09:58.651 --> 02:10:02.990
<v Speaker 2>I've ever heard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really intelligent way of saying things.</v>

2684
02:10:03.010 --> 02:10:04.110
<v Speaker 2>I just never metal guy,</v>

2685
02:10:04.370 --> 02:10:09.370
<v Speaker 3>he's almost too smart for his own good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's one of those guys when he talked to</v>

2686
02:10:09.801 --> 02:10:10.591
<v Speaker 3>me like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2687
02:10:10.591 --> 02:10:13.220
<v Speaker 3>you might be just in your own way all</v>
<v Speaker 3>the time.</v>

2688
02:10:13.640 --> 02:10:18.640
<v Speaker 3>So it's one of the reasons why thank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He decided to start a wine business out</v>

2689
02:10:18.651 --> 02:10:22.340
<v Speaker 3>of in the middle of nowhere just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And his wine is fucking excellent.</v>

2690
02:10:22.370 --> 02:10:24.830
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you're a wine person if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you like wine,</v>

2691
02:10:24.831 --> 02:10:28.160
<v Speaker 3>but caduceus wine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just know what I like and I love it.</v>

2692
02:10:28.280 --> 02:10:30.140
<v Speaker 3>It's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has a bunch of different kinds of</v>

2693
02:10:30.141 --> 02:10:31.790
<v Speaker 3>ones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

2694
02:10:31.850 --> 02:10:35.150
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a legit wizard when it comes to</v>

2695
02:10:35.151 --> 02:10:38.420
<v Speaker 3>winemaking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He really knows his shit inside and out.</v>

2696
02:10:38.421 --> 02:10:40.130
<v Speaker 3>It's not like some sort of a thing that</v>
<v Speaker 3>he leaned,</v>

2697
02:10:40.430 --> 02:10:42.340
<v Speaker 3>lends his name to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2698
02:10:42.350 --> 02:10:46.310
<v Speaker 3>like fucking orson wells.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We will sell no wine before it's time.</v>

2699
02:10:46.330 --> 02:10:46.620
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

2700
02:10:46.620 --> 02:10:51.230
<v Speaker 3>this is his wine company,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he has created it and he's also</v>

2701
02:10:51.231 --> 02:10:54.380
<v Speaker 3>like figured out a way to cultivate</v>
<v Speaker 3>grapes and it's very weird spot in</v>

2702
02:10:54.381 --> 02:10:55.640
<v Speaker 3>Arizona.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2703
02:10:55.641 --> 02:10:57.320
<v Speaker 3>I don't think anybody was doing it</v>
<v Speaker 3>before him,</v>

2704
02:10:57.321 --> 02:10:59.060
<v Speaker 3>so he had to start the thing from</v>
<v Speaker 3>scratch.</v>

2705
02:10:59.240 --> 02:11:03.290
<v Speaker 3>He did the whole thing for years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doing it for years.</v>

2706
02:11:03.470 --> 02:11:04.460
<v Speaker 3>He's nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2707
02:11:04.760 --> 02:11:06.740
<v Speaker 3>We've had some long ass conversations</v>
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>

2708
02:11:08.920 --> 02:11:10.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's one of the coolest people that I</v>

2709
02:11:10.571 --> 02:11:11.590
<v Speaker 3>talked to at the time.</v>

2710
02:11:11.630 --> 02:11:12.530
<v Speaker 2>That's Ballsy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2711
02:11:12.531 --> 02:11:14.720
<v Speaker 2>because you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might be wrong,</v>

2712
02:11:14.721 --> 02:11:19.721
<v Speaker 2>but I think you have to bring in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>couple harvest and then you won't even</v>

2713
02:11:20.571 --> 02:11:22.220
<v Speaker 2>know if the grapes are going to be any</v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

2714
02:11:22.490 --> 02:11:24.860
<v Speaker 2>That's a good spot for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're putting all this money up.</v>

2715
02:11:24.940 --> 02:11:27.190
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to analyze the soil and you</v>

2716
02:11:27.191 --> 02:11:31.130
<v Speaker 3>have to know what you're doing as far as</v>
<v Speaker 3>fertilizing it and all those all.</v>

2717
02:11:31.240 --> 02:11:33.370
<v Speaker 3>There's so many factors involved and how</v>
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>

2718
02:11:33.670 --> 02:11:37.840
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's an art.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a crazy art that you'd wind up</v>

2719
02:11:37.870 --> 02:11:40.210
<v Speaker 3>eating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You wind up drinking at the very end of</v>

2720
02:11:40.211 --> 02:11:42.430
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but creating the taste.</v>

2721
02:11:42.640 --> 02:11:46.270
<v Speaker 3>It's like the expression of the art</v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of an audible thing,</v>

2722
02:11:46.540 --> 02:11:49.420
<v Speaker 3>like a song.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It becomes a palette thing,</v>

2723
02:11:49.690 --> 02:11:52.930
<v Speaker 3>but it's a very much like the way he</v>
<v Speaker 3>creates music.</v>

2724
02:11:52.990 --> 02:11:56.380
<v Speaker 3>He creates this wine and it's a form of</v>
<v Speaker 3>art.</v>

2725
02:11:56.920 --> 02:11:58.900
<v Speaker 3>It's like a mass produce,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not mass produced,</v>

2726
02:11:58.901 --> 02:12:00.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Coca Cola,</v>

2727
02:12:00.131 --> 02:12:04.360
<v Speaker 3>but it's making more than one bottle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got several acres and he creates</v>

2728
02:12:04.361 --> 02:12:07.810
<v Speaker 3>this art and you experienced that art</v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of listening to a CD.</v>

2729
02:12:08.120 --> 02:12:11.980
<v Speaker 3>Experiencing that art when you drink is</v>
<v Speaker 3>one very fascinating guy,</v>

2730
02:12:11.981 --> 02:12:12.510
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2731
02:12:12.510 --> 02:12:14.220
<v Speaker 2>They just played in Nashville not long</v>
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>

2732
02:12:14.221 --> 02:12:15.970
<v Speaker 2>It was on tour or I probably would have</v>
<v Speaker 2>gone,</v>

2733
02:12:16.640 --> 02:12:20.120
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd say top five shows of all time.</v>

2734
02:12:20.140 --> 02:12:22.650
<v Speaker 2>Wildlife tools.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably at least two of those spots.</v>

2735
02:12:22.710 --> 02:12:23.401
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2736
02:12:23.401 --> 02:12:24.350
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2737
02:12:24.930 --> 02:12:25.381
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot.</v>

2738
02:12:25.381 --> 02:12:28.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're so incredibly tight glove just</v>

2739
02:12:28.921 --> 02:12:31.010
<v Speaker 2>aesthetically in the presentation and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sent,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most like big,</v>

<v Speaker 3>it was pristine,</v>

2744
02:12:36.110 --> 02:12:39.980
<v Speaker 3>like sound wise and the drummers of</v>

<v Speaker 3>Dana Carey.</v>

2746
02:12:41.730 --> 02:12:44.320
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't put them in a metal category.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I'd be,</v>

2747
02:12:44.740 --> 02:12:45.540
<v Speaker 3>I don't know</v>

2748
02:12:45.540 --> 02:12:47.250
<v Speaker 2>what you'd call it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2749
02:12:47.320 --> 02:12:50.270
<v Speaker 2>it was so unique.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember hearing it even.</v>

2750
02:12:51.020 --> 02:12:54.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking that's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>some complex shit going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about like motivating</v>

2753
02:12:59.421 --> 02:13:01.970
<v Speaker 3>songs that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that riff in that song.</v>

2754

<v Speaker 3>down,</v>

2756
02:13:05.730 --> 02:13:07.520
<v Speaker 3>down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>down,</v>

2757
02:13:08.970 --> 02:13:10.940
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you're lifting weights and that</v>

2758
02:13:10.941 --> 02:13:12.350
<v Speaker 3>comes on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can lift more weights,</v>

2759
02:13:12.351 --> 02:13:14.000
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can lift more weights.</v>

2760
02:13:14.390 --> 02:13:17.390
<v Speaker 3>You feel stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You like if you're tired,</v>

2761
02:13:17.540 --> 02:13:21.560
<v Speaker 3>you don't on the elliptical machine that</v>
<v Speaker 3>comes on you like you could fucking push</v>

2762
02:13:21.561 --> 02:13:23.690
<v Speaker 3>through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it does something to your body.</v>

2763
02:13:24.110 --> 02:13:27.200
<v Speaker 3>It energizes you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that's a real feeling that you get.</v>

2764
02:13:27.980 --> 02:13:30.850
<v Speaker 3>We don't think of it as a real feeling</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he can't put it on a scale for</v>

2765
02:13:30.860 --> 02:13:34.020
<v Speaker 3>visceral music.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something's happening to you when you</v>

2766
02:13:34.021 --> 02:13:34.990
<v Speaker 3>listened to a jam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's</v>

2767
02:13:35.210 --> 02:13:35.660
<v Speaker 2>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2768
02:13:35.660 --> 02:13:36.111
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2769
02:13:36.111 --> 02:13:36.561
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2770
02:13:36.561 --> 02:13:39.080
<v Speaker 2>you hate to think about though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and those guys actually experimented</v>

2771
02:13:39.081 --> 02:13:44.081
<v Speaker 2>with frequencies and a lot of those deep</v>
<v Speaker 2>down pitch tunings and time signatures</v>

2772
02:13:45.441 --> 02:13:46.510
<v Speaker 2>are varies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very,</v>

2773
02:13:46.520 --> 02:13:50.140
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very eastern melodion time signatures</v>

2774
02:13:50.150 --> 02:13:52.850
<v Speaker 2>that they're alternating in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>off down.</v>

2775
02:13:52.900 --> 02:13:54.420
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's heavy shit,</v>

2776
02:13:54.900 --> 02:13:55.671
<v Speaker 2>heavy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heavy,</v>

2777
02:13:55.671 --> 02:13:58.160
<v Speaker 2>like they put thought into that music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2778
02:13:58.161 --> 02:13:59.960
<v Speaker 2>the one song that they orchestrated to</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2779
02:13:59.961 --> 02:14:04.040
<v Speaker 2>you can totally manipulate human</v>
<v Speaker 2>emotions with tones and keys and</v>

2780
02:14:04.041 --> 02:14:06.920
<v Speaker 2>vibration as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever fucked around with</v>

2781
02:14:06.921 --> 02:14:08.750
<v Speaker 2>binaural beats?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2782
02:14:08.751 --> 02:14:11.960
<v Speaker 2>not for fun or like on record either for</v>
<v Speaker 2>fun.</v>

2783
02:14:12.200 --> 02:14:14.960
<v Speaker 3>I haven't done it either way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I know that it's real.</v>

2784
02:14:14.990 --> 02:14:19.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean I know that people swear by it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It affects your brainwaves.</v>

2785
02:14:20.170 --> 02:14:22.150
<v Speaker 2>There's a reason all these trials</v>
<v Speaker 2>throughout history,</v>

2786
02:14:22.151 --> 02:14:24.970
<v Speaker 2>out in the middle of nowhere or banging</v>
<v Speaker 2>on drums will know when they're doing</v>

2787
02:14:24.971 --> 02:14:25.930
<v Speaker 2>their thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2788
02:14:26.070 --> 02:14:28.770
<v Speaker 3>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a ICAROS.</v>

2789
02:14:29.100 --> 02:14:31.330
<v Speaker 3>You've got all those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how they say that.</v>

2790
02:14:31.500 --> 02:14:36.500
<v Speaker 3>You play when you do dmt and the DMT</v>
<v Speaker 3>entities danced to the ICO.</v>

2791
02:14:38.101 --> 02:14:41.340
<v Speaker 3>Rose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean like it's a part of the thing,</v>

2792
02:14:41.490 --> 02:14:43.820
<v Speaker 3>like when you do them together then you</v>
<v Speaker 3>understand.</v>

2793
02:14:43.840 --> 02:14:45.810
<v Speaker 3>If you listen to the music</v>
<v Speaker 3>independently,</v>

2794
02:14:45.820 --> 02:14:48.090
<v Speaker 3>like fucking weird music.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of trippy,</v>

2795
02:14:48.091 --> 02:14:52.530
<v Speaker 3>but it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think this is meant for people.</v>

2796
02:14:52.531 --> 02:14:53.940
<v Speaker 3>That hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2797
02:14:54.060 --> 02:14:56.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well this is created by a shaman.</v>

2798
02:14:56.720 --> 02:14:59.070
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this the one that I have on my phone</v>

2799
02:14:59.400 --> 02:15:04.400
<v Speaker 3>that I play is created by a shaman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's by this guy.</v>

2800
02:15:04.711 --> 02:15:09.711
<v Speaker 3>Let me see if I was homeboy's name here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think his name is actually on the um,</v>

2801
02:15:11.190 --> 02:15:12.510
<v Speaker 3>on the recording itself.</v>

2802
02:15:15.920 --> 02:15:17.200
<v Speaker 2>God Damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have it on this.</v>

2803
02:15:17.550 --> 02:15:18.850
<v Speaker 2>I was going to say that you think it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>meant.</v>

2804
02:15:18.890 --> 02:15:22.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean other than the people who are</v>
<v Speaker 2>naturally from those areas where these</v>

2805
02:15:22.901 --> 02:15:27.460
<v Speaker 2>things grow out of the ground and occur</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they use them to connect with on a</v>

2806
02:15:27.461 --> 02:15:30.550
<v Speaker 2>religious level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their spirit animals and things they</v>

2807
02:15:30.551 --> 02:15:32.440
<v Speaker 2>believe in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you like the tourists going down</v>

2808
02:15:32.441 --> 02:15:33.460
<v Speaker 2>there and drinking that shit.</v>

2809
02:15:34.660 --> 02:15:35.493
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>

2810
02:15:36.360 --> 02:15:37.350
<v Speaker 2>how do you feel about that?</v>

2811
02:15:37.700 --> 02:15:39.860
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like everything else.</v>

2812
02:15:40.010 --> 02:15:43.880
<v Speaker 3>You're going to get legit ones and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get people that realize</v>

2813
02:15:43.881 --> 02:15:46.880
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of money in tourists</v>
<v Speaker 3>coming out here and taking this wacky</v>

2814
02:15:46.940 --> 02:15:48.680
<v Speaker 3>shared.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they figured out how to make it.</v>

2815
02:15:49.250 --> 02:15:51.890
<v Speaker 3>So you're going to get people that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>taking advantage of people.</v>

2816
02:15:51.891 --> 02:15:56.891
<v Speaker 3>You got to get people that are doing all</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorts of negative shit and then you're</v>

2817
02:15:57.021 --> 02:16:01.970
<v Speaker 3>going to get legit Shaman people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>are legitimately involved in the</v>

2818
02:16:01.971 --> 02:16:06.971
<v Speaker 3>spiritual quest of attaining</v>
<v Speaker 3>enlightenment and reaching a neighboring</v>

2819
02:16:08.571 --> 02:16:11.390
<v Speaker 3>dimension,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they really believe that they're</v>

2820
02:16:11.420 --> 02:16:15.620
<v Speaker 3>reaching a neighboring dimension that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're tapping into something that's</v>

2821
02:16:15.621 --> 02:16:19.010
<v Speaker 3>around us all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then we don't have access to in a</v>

2822
02:16:19.011 --> 02:16:22.970
<v Speaker 3>normal state of consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's a well of souls who tapping</v>

2823
02:16:22.971 --> 02:16:25.190
<v Speaker 3>into.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's something.</v>

2824
02:16:25.240 --> 02:16:28.250
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's real easy to dismiss,</v>

2825
02:16:28.251 --> 02:16:29.860
<v Speaker 3>especially for someone never experienced</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2826
02:16:29.861 --> 02:16:29.980
<v Speaker 3>It's</v>

2827
02:16:29.980 --> 02:16:32.290
<v Speaker 4>really easy to dismiss and say it's all</v>
<v Speaker 4>in your imagination,</v>

2828
02:16:32.650 --> 02:16:35.950
<v Speaker 4>but for someone who has experienced it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very difficult to accept.</v>

2829
02:16:36.310 --> 02:16:39.460
<v Speaker 4>And it's very difficult for you to say</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you know,</v>

2830
02:16:39.461 --> 02:16:42.430
<v Speaker 4>for sure that it's all your imagination</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you haven't experienced it.</v>

2831
02:16:42.660 --> 02:16:43.680
<v Speaker 4>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a very,</v>

2832
02:16:43.860 --> 02:16:46.650
<v Speaker 4>I appreciate from a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from a,</v>

2833
02:16:46.660 --> 02:16:47.380
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2834
02:16:47.380 --> 02:16:51.610
<v Speaker 4>an intelligence standpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone's perspective on it that hasn't</v>

2835
02:16:51.611 --> 02:16:54.250
<v Speaker 4>experienced it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the reality is,</v>

2836
02:16:54.340 --> 02:16:58.030
<v Speaker 4>until you know what you're talking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>until you've actually gone into that</v>

2837
02:16:58.031 --> 02:17:01.720
<v Speaker 4>thing and know how titanic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the alien it is,</v>

2838
02:17:02.300 --> 02:17:05.770
<v Speaker 4>you really just saying things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're just making noises with your</v>

2839
02:17:05.771 --> 02:17:08.410
<v Speaker 4>mouth and you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no way you could know.</v>

2840
02:17:08.560 --> 02:17:09.970
<v Speaker 4>It's not like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2841
02:17:09.971 --> 02:17:11.940
<v Speaker 4>I had a dream once and it was kind of</v>
<v Speaker 4>saying,</v>

2842
02:17:12.110 --> 02:17:13.450
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2843
02:17:13.510 --> 02:17:14.343
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's.</v>

2844
02:17:14.390 --> 02:17:17.200
<v Speaker 4>You're not there anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You go to a different place.</v>

2845
02:17:17.201 --> 02:17:19.900
<v Speaker 4>You experience a different reality.</v>

2846
02:17:19.930 --> 02:17:22.930
<v Speaker 4>More real than what we normally</v>
<v Speaker 4>interpret it as reality.</v>

2847
02:17:23.020 --> 02:17:28.020
<v Speaker 4>That's the most fucked up part about it</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it's so much crisper and more vibrant</v>

2848
02:17:28.241 --> 02:17:31.960
<v Speaker 4>and brighter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then reality itself seems muted in</v>

2849
02:17:31.961 --> 02:17:34.120
<v Speaker 4>some odd way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's almost like we're,</v>

2850
02:17:34.130 --> 02:17:34.820
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>

2851
02:17:34.820 --> 02:17:37.540
<v Speaker 4>we're like having sex with a condom on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2852
02:17:37.541 --> 02:17:40.150
<v Speaker 4>and a big thick fucking trash bag,</v>
<v Speaker 4>condom.</v>

2853
02:17:40.450 --> 02:17:44.740
<v Speaker 4>And when you pass through to whatever</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fuck this other dimension is that</v>

2854
02:17:44.741 --> 02:17:45.890
<v Speaker 4>filter the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2855
02:17:45.910 --> 02:17:50.910
<v Speaker 4>the frosted window is removed and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>could see it all the fog is gone,</v>

2856
02:17:50.981 --> 02:17:55.981
<v Speaker 4>the clouds are gone and you just boom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gets shot through a cannon to the middle</v>

2857
02:17:56.921 --> 02:17:59.320
<v Speaker 4>of reality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that middle of reality of some</v>

2858
02:17:59.321 --> 02:18:04.180
<v Speaker 4>strange geometric living environment</v>
<v Speaker 4>where there's no,</v>

2859
02:18:04.181 --> 02:18:06.060
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no three dimensional objects in</v>

2860
02:18:06.160 --> 02:18:10.210
<v Speaker 4>it that aren't touching each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything is connected to everything</v>

2861
02:18:10.211 --> 02:18:11.560
<v Speaker 4>else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there's a bunch of different</v>

2862
02:18:11.561 --> 02:18:12.130
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

2863
02:18:12.130 --> 02:18:13.840
<v Speaker 4>They're constantly alternating all the</v>
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>

2864
02:18:14.050 --> 02:18:17.890
<v Speaker 4>but there's no space between anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no space between you and me.</v>

2865
02:18:18.270 --> 02:18:20.350
<v Speaker 4>Not In that world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't exist.</v>

2866
02:18:20.351 --> 02:18:21.790
<v Speaker 4>There's no space.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything is.</v>

2867
02:18:21.791 --> 02:18:25.210
<v Speaker 4>Everything is all together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all together.</v>

2868
02:18:25.211 --> 02:18:28.090
<v Speaker 4>And you feel altogether like for the</v>
<v Speaker 4>first time ever,</v>

2869
02:18:28.240 --> 02:18:33.240
<v Speaker 4>you don't feel like you're sitting in</v>
<v Speaker 4>Canoga Park in a chair with a roof over</v>

2870
02:18:33.731 --> 02:18:36.850
<v Speaker 4>your head and above that roof of the sky</v>
<v Speaker 4>and above the skies the moon.</v>

2871
02:18:36.860 --> 02:18:41.800
<v Speaker 4>You don't feel that when you're in this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you feel like you feel down infinite.</v>

2872
02:18:41.801 --> 02:18:43.840
<v Speaker 4>You feel to the left and to the right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>infinite.</v>

2873
02:18:43.841 --> 02:18:46.810
<v Speaker 4>You feel above.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you also feel like you're in a room</v>

2874
02:18:47.520 --> 02:18:49.820
<v Speaker 4>and it feels fractal and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2875
02:18:49.821 --> 02:18:51.880
<v Speaker 4>it's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2876
02:18:51.881 --> 02:18:54.370
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it might all be in your imagination,</v>

2877
02:18:54.610 --> 02:18:57.490
<v Speaker 4>but my take on it has always been,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even if it is,</v>

2878
02:18:57.730 --> 02:19:01.300
<v Speaker 4>even if you're not going to a well of</v>
<v Speaker 4>souls and experiencing God and</v>

2879
02:19:01.301 --> 02:19:06.280
<v Speaker 4>experiencing purity and wisdom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the same exact experience as if you</v>

2880
02:19:06.281 --> 02:19:09.310
<v Speaker 4>were so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even if it is in your imagination,</v>

2881
02:19:09.340 --> 02:19:13.600
<v Speaker 4>your imagination has pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fucking amazing.</v>

2882
02:19:14.050 --> 02:19:16.270
<v Speaker 4>I mean it might,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it might be.</v>

2883
02:19:16.271 --> 02:19:19.600
<v Speaker 4>That's what you're experiencing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It very well might be.</v>

2884
02:19:21.030 --> 02:19:23.420
<v Speaker 4>It's you don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there's no way to tell.</v>

2885
02:19:23.450 --> 02:19:26.380
<v Speaker 4>It's easy to be cynical.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's easy to be dismissive.</v>

2886
02:19:26.470 --> 02:19:27.560
<v Speaker 4>It's easy to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2887
02:19:27.561 --> 02:19:28.040
<v Speaker 4>come on,</v>

2888
02:19:28.040 --> 02:19:30.470
<v Speaker 3>he's fucking hippies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They think they're experiencing God</v>

2889
02:19:30.770 --> 02:19:34.130
<v Speaker 3>through some powder that they smoke in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>way to go meet head.</v>

2890
02:19:34.220 --> 02:19:34.731
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2891
02:19:34.731 --> 02:19:36.010
<v Speaker 3>You really are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a really.</v>

2892
02:19:36.011 --> 02:19:36.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's cute.</v>

2893
02:19:36.891 --> 02:19:39.140
<v Speaker 3>It's fun to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's easy to dismiss it,</v>

2894
02:19:39.380 --> 02:19:41.720
<v Speaker 3>but once you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no dismissing it.</v>

2895
02:19:41.750 --> 02:19:43.880
<v Speaker 3>When you're there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no dismissing it.</v>

2896
02:19:44.270 --> 02:19:46.790
<v Speaker 3>There's no easy explanation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no easy anything.</v>

2897
02:19:46.791 --> 02:19:47.990
<v Speaker 3>Once you're there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once you're in there,</v>

2898
02:19:47.991 --> 02:19:49.100
<v Speaker 3>you better let go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bitch.</v>

2899
02:19:49.640 --> 02:19:51.980
<v Speaker 3>You better go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You better not try to fucking wrap your</v>

2900
02:19:51.981 --> 02:19:54.890
<v Speaker 3>head around this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just breathe and try not to freak out.</v>

2901
02:19:56.720 --> 02:19:58.130
<v Speaker 3>And with that note,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ladies and gentlemen,</v>

2902
02:19:59.990 --> 02:20:00.860
<v Speaker 3>what are you doing in town?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man?</v>

2903
02:20:01.370 --> 02:20:04.020
<v Speaker 2>I got to do A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gotta.</v>

2904
02:20:04.090 --> 02:20:08.840
<v Speaker 2>I gotta do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are getting ready to put a record out</v>

2905
02:20:08.900 --> 02:20:13.900
<v Speaker 2>and tomorrow we're taping a live show</v>
<v Speaker 2>for radio station and then Wednesday</v>

2906
02:20:15.111 --> 02:20:17.690
<v Speaker 2>we're taping a song for Conan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh beautiful.</v>

2907
02:20:17.740 --> 02:20:20.120
<v Speaker 2>And then so just a little quick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quick trip out,</v>

2908
02:20:20.430 --> 02:20:24.110
<v Speaker 2>get to get to finally get the new band</v>
<v Speaker 2>at a rehearsal space and see what's</v>

2909
02:20:24.111 --> 02:20:25.220
<v Speaker 2>going on though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm excited.</v>

2910
02:20:25.710 --> 02:20:27.930
<v Speaker 3>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fun.</v>

2911
02:20:27.931 --> 02:20:30.290
<v Speaker 3>Last time I went with you to Conan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never.</v>

2912
02:20:30.850 --> 02:20:31.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was fun man.</v>

2913
02:20:32.010 --> 02:20:36.960
<v Speaker 2>You know those tv things as they go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's always a strange dynamic,</v>

2914
02:20:37.340 --> 02:20:39.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even even for performance because you</v>

2915
02:20:39.271 --> 02:20:42.230
<v Speaker 2>get there and you do it and you wait and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do it again for tv and you know and</v>

2916
02:20:42.231 --> 02:20:43.620
<v Speaker 2>you need to do it and you wait.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You wait and wait.</v>

2917
02:20:43.621 --> 02:20:45.840
<v Speaker 2>But if all of the ones that we played,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that one,</v>

2918
02:20:45.841 --> 02:20:48.120
<v Speaker 2>and maybe it's just because it's in</v>
<v Speaker 2>California,</v>

2919
02:20:48.130 --> 02:20:50.310
<v Speaker 2>where there's a far more mellow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>laid back vibe.</v>

2920
02:20:50.550 --> 02:20:52.980
<v Speaker 2>I think Cohen has a really nice studio</v>
<v Speaker 2>spaces bigger,</v>

2921
02:20:52.981 --> 02:20:54.860
<v Speaker 2>louder than New York.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was it still fun with her older,</v>

2922
02:20:54.880 --> 02:20:57.130
<v Speaker 2>more tight buildings and the union crews</v>
<v Speaker 2>are on it,</v>

2923
02:20:57.170 --> 02:20:58.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're running a crack tight,</v>

2924
02:20:59.430 --> 02:21:02.160
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which may be a better thing to keep your</v>

2925
02:21:02.161 --> 02:21:04.390
<v Speaker 2>adrenaline up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2926
02:21:04.391 --> 02:21:06.080
<v Speaker 2>We sat around all day and then at 4:30</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2927
02:21:06.081 --> 02:21:07.170
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're on a two minutes,</v>

2928
02:21:07.171 --> 02:21:09.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way millions of people are going</v>

2929
02:21:09.691 --> 02:21:10.620
<v Speaker 2>to watch this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2930
02:21:10.710 --> 02:21:14.880
<v Speaker 2>so when is this going to be on a that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure we're taping it because</v>

2931
02:21:14.881 --> 02:21:19.590
<v Speaker 2>we're out here for the other thing as</v>
<v Speaker 2>opposed to waiting until the fall when</v>

2932
02:21:19.591 --> 02:21:23.200
<v Speaker 2>we're actually her on tour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was bringing everybody out and</v>

2933
02:21:23.670 --> 02:21:25.050
<v Speaker 2>we've done it twice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

2934
02:21:25.051 --> 02:21:26.430
<v Speaker 2>him and Andy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd been great to us,</v>

2935
02:21:26.431 --> 02:21:26.840
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

<v Speaker 3>He's a well known,</v>

2938
02:21:30.200 --> 02:21:31.270
<v Speaker 3>nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>

2939

<v Speaker 3>He's doing a show,</v>

2940
02:21:33.760 --> 02:21:38.150
<v Speaker 3>sees a genuine music lover to listen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man has always been fun.</v>

2941
02:21:38.180 --> 02:21:41.580
<v Speaker 3>We've got to do this more often.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck and startle Sampson.</v>

2942
02:21:41.630 --> 02:21:43.450
<v Speaker 3>Apparently.</v>
