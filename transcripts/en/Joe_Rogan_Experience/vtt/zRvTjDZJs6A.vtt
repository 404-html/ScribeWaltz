181
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:25.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

182
00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.180

<v Speaker 1>are you supposed to pay for their trip?</v>

185
00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.880
<v Speaker 1>The loser has to shave their beard and the loser has to pay for the winners trip</v>

186
00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:39.110
<v Speaker 1>of their choice IX.</v>

187
00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.420
<v Speaker 1>Unless they can get down to two 27.</v>

188
00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.810
<v Speaker 1>And which Arusha fear agreed that he was going to pay.</v>

<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

192
00:04:49.791 --> 00:04:54.410
<v Speaker 1>their height has to be measured because the body mass index would indicate that</v>

193
00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.630
<v Speaker 1>they have to be a certain height or they're obese.</v>
