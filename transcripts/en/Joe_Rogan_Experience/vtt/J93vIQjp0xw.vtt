1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.590
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.250
<v Speaker 1>It's funny because the things that I thought used to be my weaknesses in this</v>

3
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.140
<v Speaker 1>new environment are actually your biggest strengths.</v>

4
00:00:07.141 --> 00:00:10.560
<v Speaker 1>Like I was kind of deeply insecure back when I was a journalist.</v>

5
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.140
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm a journalist again cause the congressional thing,</v>

6
00:00:13.141 --> 00:00:16.260
<v Speaker 1>I think that was a little delusional on my part to think that you can jump in</v>

7
00:00:16.261 --> 00:00:18.240
<v Speaker 1>there and hope to have any kind of chance,</v>

8
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:19.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

9
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:19.591
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

10
00:00:19.591 --> 00:00:20.640
<v Speaker 1>to be taken seriously.</v>

11
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:21.360
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

12
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.193
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

13
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.730
<v Speaker 1>now that I'm back to doing journalism,</v>

14
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.450
<v Speaker 1>the things that I used to be really insecure about that I wasn't working for a</v>

15
00:00:27.451 --> 00:00:29.070
<v Speaker 1>TV network and didn't have,</v>

16
00:00:29.071 --> 00:00:29.251
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

17
00:00:29.251 --> 00:00:31.440
<v Speaker 1>New York Times or NBC News after my name.</v>

18
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.960
<v Speaker 1>Those are actually your biggest strengths today because people go,</v>

19
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.171
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

20
00:00:34.171 --> 00:00:34.440
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

21
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.880
<v Speaker 1>if this guy knows about something,</v>

22
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.140
<v Speaker 1>he's not going to hold back.</v>

23
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.510
<v Speaker 1>He's going to do the research and put it out there.</v>

24
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.510
<v Speaker 1>And the other thing that I'm not afraid to do that I think more journalists</v>

25
00:00:42.511 --> 00:00:43.344
<v Speaker 1>should do,</v>

26
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.120
<v Speaker 1>it's put things into perspective for people.</v>

27
00:00:45.121 --> 00:00:45.960
<v Speaker 1>People are busy.</v>

28
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:46.521
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

29
00:00:46.521 --> 00:00:46.640
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

30
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.790
<v Speaker 1>I sat there reading for this boring national security stuff and then I'm able to</v>

31
00:00:50.791 --> 00:00:53.310
<v Speaker 1>pick out what's important and tell people this matters.</v>

32
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.980
<v Speaker 1>And then sometimes people will tweet me something that seems like a really big</v>

33
00:00:55.981 --> 00:00:57.360
<v Speaker 1>deal and I'll debunk it.</v>

34
00:00:57.361 --> 00:00:57.571
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

35
00:00:57.571 --> 00:01:00.030
<v Speaker 1>actually it's problematic but it probably doesn't matter because of a,</v>

36
00:01:00.031 --> 00:01:03.840
<v Speaker 1>B and c and people need that cause there's no sense of perspective anymore.</v>

37
00:01:03.841 --> 00:01:07.170
<v Speaker 1>You go to the home page of Yahoo and it's something about Obama,</v>

38
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.890
<v Speaker 1>some huge meeting with Merkel and Germany.</v>

39
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.390
<v Speaker 1>And then the next line,</v>

40
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.670
<v Speaker 1>right next to it is Kim Kardashians baby.</v>

41
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.670
<v Speaker 1>And then the line below that is the Duggar family or the Doug,</v>

42
00:01:17.671 --> 00:01:17.881
<v Speaker 1>ours,</v>

43
00:01:17.881 --> 00:01:19.500
<v Speaker 1>whatever they're called that have 19 kids.</v>

44
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:20.970
<v Speaker 1>The reality TV horse,</v>

45
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:21.721
<v Speaker 1>it's them.</v>

46
00:01:21.721 --> 00:01:23.310
<v Speaker 1>And so it fucks with your mind cause you're like,</v>

47
00:01:23.311 --> 00:01:25.410
<v Speaker 1>are these things all equally important?</v>

48
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.280
<v Speaker 1>These,</v>

49
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.280
<v Speaker 1>this is what's most important in the world today are these three stories.</v>

50
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.790
<v Speaker 1>And you need people who are not compromised by the system,</v>

51
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.950
<v Speaker 1>who have a no paycheck coming directly from a news organization to just say,</v>

52
00:01:37.951 --> 00:01:38.101
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

53
00:01:38.101 --> 00:01:38.940
<v Speaker 1>this is really important.</v>

54
00:01:38.941 --> 00:01:39.870
<v Speaker 1>People should pay attention to it.</v>

55
00:01:39.871 --> 00:01:40.830
<v Speaker 1>Or this is bullshit.</v>

56
00:01:40.831 --> 00:01:42.990
<v Speaker 1>It's just being hyped and it's not that big a deal.</v>

57
00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:43.601
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

58
00:01:43.601 --> 00:01:46.270
<v Speaker 2>essentially there's always going to be a need for junk food.</v>

59
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

60
00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.600
<v Speaker 2>And there's gonna be a need for intellectual junk food as well.</v>

61
00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.150
<v Speaker 2>And much like actual food.</v>

62
00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.640
<v Speaker 2>If you offer people intellectual junk food,</v>

63
00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.730
<v Speaker 2>there's a certain group of us,</v>

64
00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.510
<v Speaker 2>and I lump me in there as well that will self sabotage and they will,</v>

65
00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.540
<v Speaker 2>they will eat junk food and they will have a cheeseburger and then this should</v>

66
00:02:07.541 --> 00:02:11.980
<v Speaker 2>really have a salad and they will watch intellectual junk food when maybe it</v>

67
00:02:11.981 --> 00:02:15.370
<v Speaker 2>would do them better to sit down and read a book or to watch Nova or to,</v>

68
00:02:15.371 --> 00:02:16.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

69
00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.500
<v Speaker 2>see a documentary.</v>

70
00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.420
<v Speaker 2>There's sometimes you don't want to watch a documentary.</v>

71
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.120
<v Speaker 2>You want to watch a bunch of assholes bid on storage space,</v>

72
00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.841
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

73
00:02:22.841 --> 00:02:23.210
<v Speaker 2>and it doesn't,</v>

74
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:24.850
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't make any fucking sense.</v>

75
00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.321
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

76
00:02:25.321 --> 00:02:26.021
<v Speaker 1>that's good too.</v>

77
00:02:26.021 --> 00:02:28.570
<v Speaker 1>Like there's no reason that you have to do serious stuff all day long.</v>

78
00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:29.230
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

79
00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.531
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

80
00:02:29.531 --> 00:02:29.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

81
00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.750
<v Speaker 1>I certainly don't subscribe to that,</v>

82
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.360
<v Speaker 2>but you're a balanced person.</v>

83
00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:34.980
<v Speaker 2>And if you're an inbound person,</v>

84
00:02:34.981 --> 00:02:36.810
<v Speaker 2>much like people would just eat cheeseburgers,</v>

85
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.850
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have intellectual junk food,</v>

86
00:02:38.851 --> 00:02:39.271
<v Speaker 2>24,</v>

87
00:02:39.271 --> 00:02:39.660
<v Speaker 2>seven.</v>

88
00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:40.680
<v Speaker 2>You're going to be comforted.</v>

89
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.350
<v Speaker 2>Your mind will be occupied by nonsense.</v>

90
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.610
<v Speaker 2>And that's what we really need.</v>

91
00:02:44.611 --> 00:02:48.450
<v Speaker 2>Our minds are designed to be occupied by the pursuit of food,</v>

92
00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.190
<v Speaker 2>sustenance and sexuality.</v>

93
00:02:50.191 --> 00:02:51.270
<v Speaker 2>That's what we're after.</v>

94
00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:55.500
<v Speaker 2>We're trying to find a place to arrest someone to fuck something to eat,</v>

95
00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:56.401
<v Speaker 2>keep going,</v>

96
00:02:56.401 --> 00:02:56.881
<v Speaker 2>ready,</v>

97
00:02:56.881 --> 00:02:57.990
<v Speaker 2>go get up in the morning.</v>

98
00:02:57.991 --> 00:02:58.621
<v Speaker 2>Are you awake?</v>

99
00:02:58.621 --> 00:02:59.230
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

100
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.870
<v Speaker 2>fill the needs and now those needs are filled.</v>

101
00:03:01.871 --> 00:03:05.470
<v Speaker 2>Instead you're plugged into a fucking video game and you're playing football</v>

102
00:03:05.471 --> 00:03:09.370
<v Speaker 2>with some digital characters and you're eating pizza that some guy actually</v>

103
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.020
<v Speaker 2>walked up to your fucking door and all you need to do is give them some paper</v>

104
00:03:14.021 --> 00:03:15.190
<v Speaker 2>that means almost nothing.</v>

105
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.910
<v Speaker 2>And he gives you pizza and you stuffing your fat face and go right back to your</v>

106
00:03:18.911 --> 00:03:19.744
<v Speaker 2>stupid game.</v>

107
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.000
<v Speaker 2>And it's so easy to do that.</v>

108
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.110
<v Speaker 2>It's so easy to do that.</v>

109
00:03:23.111 --> 00:03:27.730
<v Speaker 2>As long as you can do enough to justify enough ones and Zeros coming into your,</v>

110
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.740
<v Speaker 2>whatever your bank account is these days.</v>

111
00:03:29.741 --> 00:03:30.940
<v Speaker 2>It's not the vault.</v>

112
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.440
<v Speaker 2>The vaults are filled with paper.</v>

113
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.270
<v Speaker 2>You know what's in that fucking fault?</v>

114
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.440
<v Speaker 2>It's vault filled with paper that's promising something he promises inside.</v>

115
00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.030
<v Speaker 2>Jason,</v>

116
00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.930
<v Speaker 2>what kind of car do you drive it?</v>

117
00:03:41.931 --> 00:03:42.710
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

118
00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:45.710
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a car and one of those mother fuckers.</v>

119
00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm in New York or New York.</v>

120
00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.921
<v Speaker 2>You don't,</v>

121
00:03:48.921 --> 00:03:50.420
<v Speaker 2>you don't drive cars.</v>

122
00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:51.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

123
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.340
<v Speaker 2>when I lived here I had a car.</v>

124
00:03:52.341 --> 00:03:54.020
<v Speaker 2>I want to ask you about that Tesla.</v>

125
00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.000
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

126
00:03:56.001 --> 00:03:57.670
<v Speaker 2>Is that the coolest thing of all time?</v>

127
00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:58.070
<v Speaker 2>Incredible.</v>

128
00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.881
<v Speaker 2>And they're only gonna get better.</v>

129
00:03:58.881 --> 00:04:01.240
<v Speaker 2>I think they were about to release like the third or fourth generation now.</v>

130
00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.990
<v Speaker 2>Martine Rothblatt had one and when I interviewed her and I got to meet her robot</v>

131
00:04:05.991 --> 00:04:06.980
<v Speaker 2>Bina 48.</v>

132
00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

133
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.821
<v Speaker 2>You ever seen that?</v>

134
00:04:07.821 --> 00:04:08.070
<v Speaker 2>Her,</v>

135
00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.350
<v Speaker 2>her spouse as a robot,</v>

136
00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:10.730
<v Speaker 2>Martine Rothblatt.</v>

137
00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.890
<v Speaker 2>Fascinating story was a man,</v>

138
00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.843
<v Speaker 2>wasn't man,</v>

139
00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:14.151
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

140
00:04:14.151 --> 00:04:15.770
<v Speaker 2>founded Sirius satellite radio,</v>

141
00:04:15.771 --> 00:04:16.551
<v Speaker 2>got a sex change,</v>

142
00:04:16.551 --> 00:04:17.390
<v Speaker 2>became a woman,</v>

143
00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.920
<v Speaker 2>and then created a robot that is a direct copy,</v>

144
00:04:21.921 --> 00:04:23.360
<v Speaker 2>a duplicate of her spouse,</v>

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.210
<v Speaker 2>and it could really be how good it looks.</v>

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:32.780

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

156
00:04:33.021 --> 00:04:33.561
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting.</v>

157
00:04:33.561 --> 00:04:36.110
<v Speaker 2>Liberace making that guy changed his face to him.</v>

158
00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:37.183
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

159
00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.961
<v Speaker 2>You really do that.</v>

160
00:04:37.961 --> 00:04:38.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

161
00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:39.133
<v Speaker 2>You really do that.</v>

162
00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.250
<v Speaker 2>They don't get plastic surgery.</v>

163
00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.600
<v Speaker 2>Did you really do look more like Liberace?</v>

164
00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:42.620
<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

167
00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:48.690
<v Speaker 2>I always wondered why Matt Damon and Michael Douglas were willing to do that and</v>

168
00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:49.740
<v Speaker 2>if they have pictures of those,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

171
00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.280
<v Speaker 2>That's the only thing that makes sense.</v>

172
00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:53.860
<v Speaker 2>Whether they agreed to do a live,</v>

173
00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.670
<v Speaker 2>like if they came up to you when you were,</v>

174
00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:57.500
<v Speaker 2>you were Matt Damon when they said,</v>

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:04.610
<v Speaker 3>I think the sex does sex technology will probably be the pioneer.</v>

<v Speaker 3>who do you think was doing the most advanced?</v>

236
00:06:10.011 --> 00:06:11.750
<v Speaker 3>Like multi-angle interactive.</v>

237
00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:13.010
<v Speaker 3>The experiences was the point of this,</v>

238
00:06:13.011 --> 00:06:13.190
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

239
00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:17.180
<v Speaker 3>I mean we always had phones wasn't going to go with that old style of video.</v>

240
00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:18.170

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.220
<v Speaker 3>I never did the rest of them totally.</v>

246
00:06:22.221 --> 00:06:24.950
<v Speaker 3>I mean we're always going to be driven by sort of our sexual desires.</v>

247
00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:28.340
<v Speaker 3>Kurzweil says we'll be able to tap into each other's nervous systems and become</v>

248
00:06:28.341 --> 00:06:30.250
<v Speaker 3>each other when we have sex with her.</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's girl finding with someone actually merging.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

254
00:06:35.151 --> 00:06:36.080

255
00:06:36.081 --> 00:06:38.750
<v Speaker 3>we've been wanting to merge with our lovers at the beginning of time.</v>

256
00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:39.590
<v Speaker 3>I want to become one,</v>

257
00:06:39.591 --> 00:06:42.140

<v Speaker 3>That could be a real mind fuck though.</v>

262
00:06:47.061 --> 00:06:50.030
<v Speaker 3>If you just find out that you aren't like the worst in bed ever,</v>

263
00:06:50.031 --> 00:06:52.400
<v Speaker 3>you feel what it's like to be fucked by you?</v>

<v Speaker 3>what you want and you get into her mind.</v>

279
00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:25.730
<v Speaker 3>It's just a river of black cock.</v>

280
00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:30.830
<v Speaker 3>She's sleepy river of disembodied black cops just shooting,</v>
