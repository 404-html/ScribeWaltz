1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.960
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience and this</v>
<v Speaker 1>extreme lack of empathy though the lack</v>

2
00:00:06.271 --> 00:00:09.030
<v Speaker 1>of empathy towards anyone who doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>share your position.</v>

3
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.760
<v Speaker 1>This is very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's um,</v>

4
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.960
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's piss poor thinking and it's</v>

5
00:00:15.961 --> 00:00:16.794
<v Speaker 1>everywhere</v>

6
00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.210
<v Speaker 2>and in everyone wants to feel like not</v>
<v Speaker 2>being a part of one of the tribes is it</v>

7
00:00:22.211 --> 00:00:26.410
<v Speaker 2>extremely lonely position and you get</v>
<v Speaker 2>called all the bad names because people</v>

8
00:00:26.411 --> 00:00:29.800
<v Speaker 2>want you to be a part of their tribe and</v>
<v Speaker 2>people don't want to be called bad names</v>

9
00:00:29.801 --> 00:00:33.040
<v Speaker 2>and they want to feel like they're are</v>
<v Speaker 2>any name group hug emotionally.</v>

10
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.640
<v Speaker 2>I totally got that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

11
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.220
<v Speaker 2>Kind of sucks being homeless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it's just politically homeless.</v>

12
00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.810
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just when you got a president</v>

13
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.840
<v Speaker 1>that's so polarizing and you have an</v>
<v Speaker 1>opposition to him that's so there,</v>

14
00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.720
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so much momentum in opposing him</v>

15
00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.670
<v Speaker 1>and I think this is a giant wedge in</v>
<v Speaker 1>between these two sides.</v>

16
00:00:57.671 --> 00:01:01.510
<v Speaker 1>And then you have that hat and that hat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that kid wasn't wearing that hat,</v>

17
00:01:01.511 --> 00:01:04.300
<v Speaker 1>a guarantee and be like 20% less hate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be.</v>

18
00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.630
<v Speaker 1>It would be people would still get mad</v>
<v Speaker 1>at him because he was still like,</v>

19
00:01:07.631 --> 00:01:11.080
<v Speaker 1>I've seen people say when a native elder</v>
<v Speaker 1>walks up to you and he's banging his</v>

20
00:01:11.081 --> 00:01:13.150
<v Speaker 1>drums,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get the fuck out of the way.</v>

21
00:01:13.151 --> 00:01:14.080
<v Speaker 1>I saw that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

22
00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.930
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't expect that you what?</v>

23
00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.240
<v Speaker 1>You can't just beat your drum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

24
00:01:19.241 --> 00:01:22.090
<v Speaker 1>he got right in the kid's face like</v>
<v Speaker 1>inches from the kid's face.</v>

25
00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.630
<v Speaker 1>Pretty amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The restraint this kid had to just smile</v>

26
00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.610
<v Speaker 1>and the idea that you're going to judge</v>
<v Speaker 1>this kid millions and millions and</v>

27
00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:31.900
<v Speaker 1>millions of people going over this right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

28
00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.470
<v Speaker 1>That kid woke up that morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had no fucking idea.</v>

29
00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.840
<v Speaker 1>He was a kid in a cult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

30
00:01:37.841 --> 00:01:42.160
<v Speaker 1>He's in a Catholic cult school and he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to some weird thing,</v>

31
00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.920
<v Speaker 1>some march for life where people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to kill babies.</v>

32
00:01:44.921 --> 00:01:46.300
<v Speaker 1>We've got to stop him from killing</v>
<v Speaker 1>babies,</v>

33
00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.370
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he goes there and there's this black</v>

34
00:01:48.371 --> 00:01:52.120
<v Speaker 1>Israelites calling them the faggots and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's these all these people calling</v>

35
00:01:52.121 --> 00:01:54.370
<v Speaker 1>them names.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then all of a sudden this guy's</v>

36
00:01:54.371 --> 00:01:56.500
<v Speaker 1>beating the drum in front of his face</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're supposed to,</v>

37
00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.320
<v Speaker 1>we're supposed to docsis kid now cause</v>
<v Speaker 1>he smirked.</v>

38
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.850
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] that's a crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an impossible lack of empathy.</v>

39
00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.300
<v Speaker 1>It's impossible to defend like unless</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hate boys,</v>

40
00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:13.930
<v Speaker 1>unless you hate all boys because boys</v>
<v Speaker 1>are dumb like 16 year old boys are</v>

41
00:02:13.931 --> 00:02:15.850
<v Speaker 1>almost universally dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all,</v>

42
00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.450
<v Speaker 1>they all grow up to be men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of those men will be your best</v>

43
00:02:19.451 --> 00:02:19.890
<v Speaker 1>friend.</v>

44
00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.320
<v Speaker 1>So when those men will be amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of those men you be so happy to see</v>

45
00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:24.760
<v Speaker 1>when you see him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll give him a big hug.</v>

46
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
<v Speaker 1>Okay lets me write me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a stupid fucking 16 year old and</v>

47
00:02:30.041 --> 00:02:33.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm a man now and I try to be as nice as</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can to everybody.</v>

48
00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.920
<v Speaker 1>I go way out of my way to be a kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

49
00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.920
<v Speaker 1>That could be that kid too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what you're doing is not good for</v>

50
00:02:38.921 --> 00:02:40.180
<v Speaker 1>anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

51
00:02:40.181 --> 00:02:43.870
<v Speaker 1>it's not good for society to take this</v>
<v Speaker 1>trend and run with it.</v>

52
00:02:43.871 --> 00:02:44.621
<v Speaker 1>And this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

53
00:02:44.621 --> 00:02:45.910
<v Speaker 1>this is what people do now</v>

54
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.080
<v Speaker 2>we're coming home from a Christmas</v>
<v Speaker 2>extravaganza,</v>

55
00:02:49.081 --> 00:02:51.000
<v Speaker 2>which I do with my buddies every year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right before Christmas,</v>

56
00:02:51.001 --> 00:02:55.140
<v Speaker 2>we get a big card pile in and we'd go</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christmas shopping for our families.</v>

57
00:02:55.141 --> 00:03:00.141
<v Speaker 2>And what have you coming home loaded?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I supposedly threw a burrito from taco</v>

58
00:03:03.071 --> 00:03:06.910
<v Speaker 2>bell or something and hit the guard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's four,</v>

59
00:03:06.911 --> 00:03:08.710
<v Speaker 2>three or four of my buddies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We get to my house,</v>

60
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.410
<v Speaker 2>we pig out on Shitty Taco bell food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

61
00:03:11.411 --> 00:03:15.340
<v Speaker 2>until everybody passes out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the next thing I know the cop lights</v>

62
00:03:15.341 --> 00:03:16.720
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are banging on the door.</v>

63
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:17.590
<v Speaker 2>Get out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

64
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:18.550
<v Speaker 2>I come to the door.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

65
00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:19.673
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

66
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.200
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after you've been drinking it,</v>

67
00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:23.860
<v Speaker 2>he'd do a bunch of food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're fucking gone.</v>

68
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.800
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so long story short,</v>

69
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.970
<v Speaker 2>they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

70
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.360
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be arrested for assault</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't go down and say you're</v>

71
00:03:31.361 --> 00:03:32.500
<v Speaker 2>sorry to this guy saw what?</v>

72
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:33.790
<v Speaker 2>A burrito.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

73
00:03:33.791 --> 00:03:35.150
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by the end.</v>

74
00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.070
<v Speaker 2>So if you charge a man with a salt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he throws a Burrito at you,</v>

75
00:03:39.071 --> 00:03:41.170
<v Speaker 2>you should,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should turn in your card.</v>

76
00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.350
<v Speaker 2>But we were to tape,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was not like throwing it at him.</v>

77
00:03:44.351 --> 00:03:46.600
<v Speaker 2>It's not like I've barely with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>baseball right here.</v>

78
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.240
<v Speaker 2>I like chunked it to him to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he didn't see it coming and so it</v>

79
00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.600
<v Speaker 2>like slapped him and fell down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they cuffed me,</v>

80
00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.360
<v Speaker 2>they take me down to the guard house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

81
00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.520
<v Speaker 2>they put me in the back of a cop car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kofi cops.</v>

82
00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:58.800
<v Speaker 2>These are real ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>

83
00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.990
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He filed a report and a,</v>

84
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.510
<v Speaker 2>so this is how stupid it gets shaped by</v>
<v Speaker 2>then.</v>

85
00:04:04.511 --> 00:04:06.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm so fricking loaded,</v>

<v Speaker 2>on the ground,</v>

87
00:04:08.921 --> 00:04:11.620
<v Speaker 2>like it's evidence or some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're telling me,</v>

88
00:04:11.621 --> 00:04:15.100
<v Speaker 2>I gotta apologize to this guy and all I</v>
<v Speaker 2>can focus on is there's a perfectly good</v>

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.290
<v Speaker 2>white people stole this from us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

117
00:05:32.291 --> 00:05:35.800
<v Speaker 2>that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He say the children or the people that</v>

118
00:05:35.801 --> 00:05:40.060
<v Speaker 2>were here left and they never came back</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they didn't think what they</v>

119
00:05:40.061 --> 00:05:42.340
<v Speaker 2>parents built was good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh man,</v>

120
00:05:42.341 --> 00:05:45.070
<v Speaker 2>to kill me because that not just black</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

121
00:05:45.071 --> 00:05:50.040
<v Speaker 2>that's Americans period.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have gotten to a point where we are</v>

122
00:05:50.041 --> 00:05:52.450
<v Speaker 2>on appreciative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are entitled,</v>

123
00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.540
<v Speaker 2>and we don't think what happened before</v>
<v Speaker 2>us was good enough.</v>

124
00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.860
<v Speaker 2>So we don't treasure it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't honor it.</v>

125
00:05:57.861 --> 00:05:58.160
<v Speaker 2>We don't</v>

126
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.460
<v Speaker 1>reinvest in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That could be a farm in Milledgeville,</v>

127
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:05.600
<v Speaker 1>that could be a house in Adamsville,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we have to do a better job of</v>

128
00:06:05.601 --> 00:06:08.460
<v Speaker 1>appreciating ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>appreciating our community and in</v>

129
00:06:08.461 --> 00:06:11.450
<v Speaker 1>appreciate now greater community and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to reenter.</v>

130
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.720
<v Speaker 1>You have to reenter fi day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be a part of whatever</v>

00:06:14.721 --> 00:06:18.470
<v Speaker 1>gentrification happens to make sure that</v>
<v Speaker 1>your stake is still there and that what</v>

132
00:06:18.471 --> 00:06:21.530
<v Speaker 1>you care about from a morals and civil</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective represented there.</v>

133
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:26.090
<v Speaker 1>I've known Bobby Lee for 20 plus years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's never put out a comedy special.</v>

<v Speaker 1>his face in the 90s,</v>

143
00:06:54.191 --> 00:06:56.710
