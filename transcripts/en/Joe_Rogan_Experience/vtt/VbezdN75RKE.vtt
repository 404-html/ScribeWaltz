34
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.620
<v Speaker 1>First Time I came out here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we did a Gig with them.</v>

35
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.110
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

36
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.553
<v Speaker 1>So what made you move from Austin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like one of the best spots in </v>

37
00:01:14.371 --> 00:01:17.100
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you could pull it off to California,</v>

38
00:01:17.101 --> 00:01:20.640
<v Speaker 1>which is still one of the best spots in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world if you can pull it off,</v>

39
00:01:20.641 --> 00:01:23.750
<v Speaker 1>but so much more complex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much more bullshit.</v>

40
00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.460
<v Speaker 1>So much marty ego.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So much more traffic.</v>

41
00:01:26.461 --> 00:01:30.900
<v Speaker 1>So much more actors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

42
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.120
<v Speaker 1>That's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

43
00:01:33.121 --> 00:01:34.740
<v Speaker 1>That's very true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

44
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.060
<v Speaker 1>I spent some time in New York City.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spent my whole life in Austin,</v>

45
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.850
<v Speaker 1>always wanting to come out west and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>figured out what it's like,</v>

46
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:42.570
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

47
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.730
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I got the opportunity to do it.</v>

48
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.740
<v Speaker 1>So I'm just how you're checking it out </v>
<v Speaker 1>being in a few months.</v>

49
00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:47.380
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he's,</v>

50
00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.950
<v Speaker 1>there was no like specific like pulling </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>

51
00:01:49.951 --> 00:01:52.470
<v Speaker 1>You said let me just try La.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

52
00:01:52.471 --> 00:01:55.590
<v Speaker 1>me and my girl just decided we spend </v>
<v Speaker 1>some time out here.</v>

53
00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.780
<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like moves like that,</v>

54
00:01:57.781 --> 00:01:59.400
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think about doing those all the time.</v>

55
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.443
<v Speaker 1>But my wife is so not into that because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I moved that bitch at the top of my </v>

56
00:02:03.001 --> 00:02:05.790
<v Speaker 1>mountain at one time and she almost fell</v>
<v Speaker 1>off the club.</v>

57
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.953
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for real drive of the snow dog got </v>

58
00:02:09.601 --> 00:02:12.600
<v Speaker 1>killed by a mountain lion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a punch of shit happened.</v>

59
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.441
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be My,</v>

60
00:02:13.441 --> 00:02:14.940
<v Speaker 1>I was in heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Loved it.</v>

61
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.690
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eh.</v>

62
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.513
<v Speaker 1>Speaking of mountain lions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard they're like creeping around </v>

63
00:02:23.701 --> 00:02:25.470
<v Speaker 1>over here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's quite a few of them.</v>

64
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There you can't hunt them in California.</v>

65
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.230
<v Speaker 1>So they have no natural predators other </v>
<v Speaker 1>than cars.</v>

66
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.513
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's people that think that's a </v>

67
00:02:33.751 --> 00:02:36.360
<v Speaker 1>good idea because they keep the deer </v>
<v Speaker 1>population in check.</v>

68
00:02:36.361 --> 00:02:39.030
<v Speaker 1>There's a good argument for that cause </v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't have lyme disease.</v>

69
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.370
<v Speaker 1>It's very little lyme disease in </v>
<v Speaker 1>California.</v>

70
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.580
<v Speaker 1>And one of the reasons for that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that not that many deer,</v>

71
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.700
<v Speaker 1>especially around here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas if you're on the east coast,</v>

72
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.953
<v Speaker 1>the east coast right now has a real lyme</v>
<v Speaker 1>disease epidemic because these deer </v>

73
00:02:52.171 --> 00:02:53.004
<v Speaker 1>overpopulated and overpopulated dear </v>
<v Speaker 1>means you don't get enough food and </v>

74
00:02:55.861 --> 00:03:00.220
<v Speaker 1>they're more susceptible to disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And fucking lyme disease is the big one.</v>

75
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.113
<v Speaker 1>Ticks these ticks with lyme disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know a bunch of people from the east </v>

76
00:03:04.281 --> 00:03:06.130
<v Speaker 1>coast that have got lyme disease.</v>

77
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.520
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's big down in Texas too.</v>

78
00:03:08.521 --> 00:03:10.420
<v Speaker 1>There's deer everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

79
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.500
<v Speaker 1>I guess that's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'd be freaked out if I walked out.</v>

80
00:03:14.501 --> 00:03:15.910
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the time,</v>

81
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:16.773
<v Speaker 1>don't have to worry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of the time they're going after </v>

82
00:03:18.101 --> 00:03:18.934
<v Speaker 1>cats and dogs and shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They killed a lot of rabbits and small </v>

83
00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.420
<v Speaker 1>animals and deer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've decimated the deer population.</v>

84
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:26.343
<v Speaker 1>They kill most of the deer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either coyotes get them or mountain </v>

85
00:03:29.471 --> 00:03:30.071
<v Speaker 1>lions get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

86
00:03:30.071 --> 00:03:32.290
<v Speaker 1>when I see deer in my neighborhood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty unusual.</v>

87
00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.840
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if I go back east,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

88
00:03:34.841 --> 00:03:35.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

89
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.930
<v Speaker 1>like I have a buddy lives on a farm in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

90
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.500
<v Speaker 1>well he owns a farm in Wisconsin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this fucking deer everywhere there.</v>

91
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.230
<v Speaker 1>So that's the type of place where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>got to worry about ticks.</v>

92
00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.780
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You worried about mountain lines?</v>

93
00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:48.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

94
00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.590
<v Speaker 2>anything that could like take a chunk.</v>

95
00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:52.091
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me,</v>

96
00:03:52.091 --> 00:03:54.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm a little bit worried about what do </v>
<v Speaker 1>you live?</v>

97
00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.250
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't say Pacif specifically.</v>

98
00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And live somewhere hilly?</v>

99
00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.651
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

100
00:04:00.651 --> 00:04:01.484
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

101
00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:02.443
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you an a flat lands where the </v>

102
00:04:03.521 --> 00:04:04.354
<v Speaker 1>people are all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they did kill one in someone's backyard </v>

103
00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.740
<v Speaker 1>and Santa Monica two years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

104

<v Speaker 1>Fucking Santa Monica.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember that?</v>

105
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:11.463
<v Speaker 1>It was a big one too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like 150 pound cat and some </v>

106
00:04:14.381 --> 00:04:17.350
<v Speaker 1>dude's yard just chilling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sleeping in his yard.</v>

107
00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:19.413
<v Speaker 1>I can't do that.</v>

108
00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:21.490
<v Speaker 3>Talking about something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

109
00:04:21.491 --> 00:04:24.020
<v Speaker 3>I freaked out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't,</v>

110
00:04:24.021 --> 00:04:25.400
<v Speaker 3>I just don't fuck with nature of that.</v>

111
00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:29.240
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a,</v>

128
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.433

<v Speaker 1>like there's a lot of like helicopters </v>
<v Speaker 1>that fly over like the Malibu coast.</v>

158
00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:32.053
<v Speaker 1>They take video footage of pig has great</v>
<v Speaker 1>white sharks all the time that are just </v>

159
00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:38.390
<v Speaker 1>a couple of hundred yards away from </v>
<v Speaker 1>people surfing.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

164
00:06:47.901 --> 00:06:50.450
<v Speaker 1>because it's a big flat area and there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of criminals.</v>

165
00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.040
<v Speaker 1>It's a good way to catch people put </v>
<v Speaker 1>spot.</v>

166
00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:54.290
<v Speaker 1>It's weird when you watch it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

167
00:06:54.291 --> 00:06:56.260
<v Speaker 1>they call them ghetto birds.</v>

168
00:06:56.261 --> 00:06:58.880
<v Speaker 1>the helicopters are flying over and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>had a spotlight on somebody.</v>

169
00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.250
<v Speaker 1>You start feeling guilty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You haven't even done shit.</v>

170
00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:02.460
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

171
00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.290

<v Speaker 1>I would imagine.</v>

172
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:07.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially,</v>

173
00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:09.680
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't a matter of town what it </v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

174
00:07:09.681 --> 00:07:12.680
<v Speaker 1>Damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long have you been doing music,</v>

175
00:07:12.681 --> 00:07:13.220
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

176
00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:14.150
<v Speaker 2>man?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

177
00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:20.900
<v Speaker 2>I've been playing guitar since 96.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

178
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:24.740
<v Speaker 2>I always kind of wanted one and my folks</v>
<v Speaker 2>were,</v>

179
00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.520
<v Speaker 2>I had a habit of quitting what I </v>
<v Speaker 2>started,</v>

180
00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:31.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I played baseball for a little bit.</v>

181
00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:33.860
<v Speaker 2>I tried to do martial arts for a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit.</v>

182
00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:35.190
<v Speaker 2>I try to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

183
00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:39.750
<v Speaker 2>basketball,</v>
<v Speaker 2>football and none of it kind of stuck.</v>

184
00:07:39.751 --> 00:07:41.570
<v Speaker 2>How would always kind of go back to </v>
<v Speaker 2>music.</v>

185
00:07:41.571 --> 00:07:42.920
<v Speaker 2>So finally in [inaudible] 96,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

186
00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:47.060
<v Speaker 2>I got in and quit caring about anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

187
00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:50.840
<v Speaker 2>I got a guitar discovered urban,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

188
00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:53.353
<v Speaker 1>and that was about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you take lessons or did you self </v>

189
00:07:56.331 --> 00:07:57.164
<v Speaker 1>taught?</v>

190
00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.440
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't take lessons formerly.</v>

191
00:08:00.441 --> 00:08:04.130
<v Speaker 2>Like I didn't pay anybody for lessons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My probably should at this point.</v>

192
00:08:04.131 --> 00:08:04.964
<v Speaker 2>When my friend of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he [inaudible] say she had a guitar and </v>

193
00:08:07.791 --> 00:08:11.690
<v Speaker 2>she had a band and she earned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>her band would practice all the time.</v>

194
00:08:11.691 --> 00:08:12.524
<v Speaker 2>So I would hear him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I would go over there and check it </v>

195
00:08:14.751 --> 00:08:17.990
<v Speaker 2>out and I'll take my guitar and she </v>
<v Speaker 2>would show me,</v>

196
00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:20.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a 12 bar blues,</v>

197
00:08:20.781 --> 00:08:25.781
<v Speaker 2>kind of like a Jimmy Reed shuffle type </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing or like a power chord,</v>

198
00:08:26.121 --> 00:08:27.800
<v Speaker 2>rock and roll thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

199
00:08:27.801 --> 00:08:31.070
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that was kind of how I first started.</v>

200
00:08:31.071 --> 00:08:31.904
<v Speaker 2>And I rented books.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to the school library and my </v>

201
00:08:35.301 --> 00:08:38.000
<v Speaker 2>middle school library and just rented </v>
<v Speaker 2>like how to play guitar.</v>

202
00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:40.640
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Watch this TV show,</v>

203
00:08:40.641 --> 00:08:43.610
<v Speaker 2>Austin city limits that came on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know Saturday.</v>

204
00:08:43.611 --> 00:08:45.770
<v Speaker 2>So I used to just sit there and figure </v>
<v Speaker 2>it out,</v>

205
00:08:45.771 --> 00:08:46.604
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why record the tapes and go back and </v>

206
00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:49.093
<v Speaker 2>figure it out.</v>

207
00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:50.433
<v Speaker 1>So it was essentially like the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that you really connected to that </v>

208
00:08:54.431 --> 00:08:56.610
<v Speaker 1>you stuck with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

209
00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:00.410
<v Speaker 2>What was it about playing guitar?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

210
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:03.540
<v Speaker 2>I think the thing for me was</v>

211
00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:06.393
<v Speaker 4>mmm,</v>

212
00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:09.653
<v Speaker 2>I mean I love music and I mean the </v>
<v Speaker 2>guitar for me was the instrument that </v>

213
00:09:14.581 --> 00:09:19.581
<v Speaker 2>could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could paint so many different colors.</v>

214
00:09:19.621 --> 00:09:20.850
<v Speaker 2>It was very versatile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

215
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.620
<v Speaker 2>it can be loud,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aggressive.</v>

216
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:25.320
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Be Sweet.</v>

217
00:09:25.321 --> 00:09:26.550
<v Speaker 2>Beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

218
00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:28.583
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

219
00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:32.250
<v Speaker 2>I just thought if I could get my hands </v>
<v Speaker 2>on one of those,</v>

220
00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:34.560
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

221
00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:36.960
<v Speaker 2>try and push it to the limit and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

222
00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:39.870
<v Speaker 2>and I really figured it out.</v>

223
00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:41.443
<v Speaker 4>MMM.</v>

224
00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:44.700
<v Speaker 2>You just play with like the full </v>
<v Speaker 2>spectrum.</v>

225
00:09:44.701 --> 00:09:47.100
<v Speaker 2>It's different than playing an electric </v>
<v Speaker 2>guitar.</v>

226
00:09:47.101 --> 00:09:47.934
<v Speaker 2>For me it seemed more there was more </v>
<v Speaker 2>options than like a playing drums or </v>

227
00:09:54.271 --> 00:09:57.750
<v Speaker 2>playing the trumpet or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I mean with toys and you know,</v>

228
00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.430
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things like that.</v>

229
00:09:59.431 --> 00:10:01.590
<v Speaker 2>So that was it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

230
00:10:01.591 --> 00:10:04.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm still trying to figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm as interested in it,</v>

231
00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 years later as I was,</v>

232
00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:09.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then that means you got the right thing.</v>

233
00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:10.973
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely found it so fortunately </v>

234
00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:13.573
<v Speaker 2>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the hardest things for </v>

235
00:10:14.751 --> 00:10:15.584
<v Speaker 2>kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

236
00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:16.693
<v Speaker 2>When you're a young kid and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>really know what you want to do with </v>

237
00:10:18.891 --> 00:10:19.724
<v Speaker 2>your life and your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your whole future just looks like just </v>

238
00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:23.593
<v Speaker 2>confusing sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The hardest thing is finding something </v>

239
00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:29.780
<v Speaker 2>that really rings your bell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Finding something.</v>

240
00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:34.420
<v Speaker 2>So for you it seems like there was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of different other options.</v>

241
00:10:34.421 --> 00:10:36.320
<v Speaker 2>It didn't get groups,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't really click.</v>

242
00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:40.250
<v Speaker 2>And then the guitar just that was it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

243
00:10:40.251 --> 00:10:41.090
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

244
00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:44.210
<v Speaker 2>baseball was a terrible hitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was pretty fast.</v>

245
00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:47.950
<v Speaker 2>Basketball was tall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was stan,</v>

246
00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:48.880
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

247
00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:49.793
<v Speaker 2>put me in a post and I would get pushed </v>
<v Speaker 2>out by these huge guys and I got tired </v>

248
00:10:53.091 --> 00:10:53.924
<v Speaker 2>of my coach going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Goddamn a junior when he got to quit </v>

249
00:10:55.491 --> 00:10:56.390
<v Speaker 2>being a bitch.</v>

250
00:10:58.810 --> 00:10:59.643
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

251
00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:03.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just just with music,</v>

252
00:11:03.051 --> 00:11:04.760
<v Speaker 2>it would just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just kinda clicked.</v>

253
00:11:04.761 --> 00:11:07.620
<v Speaker 2>It was something for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What martial law should you do?</v>

254
00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:09.710
<v Speaker 2>A,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried to Quanta.</v>

255
00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:11.610
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

256
00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:13.950
<v Speaker 2>Perfect bill for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

257
00:11:13.951 --> 00:11:15.870
<v Speaker 2>I just didn't have the patients at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

258
00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:19.110
<v Speaker 2>I really didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish I stuck with it,</v>

259
00:11:19.111 --> 00:11:20.310
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

260
00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:23.130
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

261
00:11:23.131 --> 00:11:23.964
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have the patience or the </v>

262
00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:26.130
<v Speaker 2>discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to,</v>

263
00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:30.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be focused and I wanted to,</v>

264
00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:31.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something out the window,</v>

265
00:11:31.591 --> 00:11:33.880
<v Speaker 2>I want to go run and jump out the </v>
<v Speaker 2>window,</v>

266
00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:35.880
<v Speaker 2>go ride bikes or whatever it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

267
00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:36.743
<v Speaker 2>they call that add.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I call that just being a fucking </v>

268
00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:41.533
<v Speaker 2>person and curious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a lot of shit that doesn't </v>

269
00:11:43.941 --> 00:11:44.774
<v Speaker 2>occupy your attention and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to make it occupy your </v>

270
00:11:46.551 --> 00:11:47.570
<v Speaker 2>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

271
00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:49.970
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you keep yourself pretty busy.</v>

272
00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:50.913
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like,</v>

273
00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:54.250
<v Speaker 2>like guitar obviously occupied your </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention.</v>

274
00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:56.013
<v Speaker 5>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like I don't believe in add in a </v>

275
00:11:58.961 --> 00:11:59.794
<v Speaker 5>lot of senses and a lot of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think there's obviously some people </v>

276
00:12:01.751 --> 00:12:04.840
<v Speaker 5>that have like a mental issue,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think for most people what they're</v>

277
00:12:04.841 --> 00:12:09.841
<v Speaker 5>calling add is being bored.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You just bored like school.</v>

278
00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:13.870
<v Speaker 5>How fucking boring in school school's </v>
<v Speaker 5>terribly boring.</v>

279
00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:15.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was terrible.</v>

280
00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:18.800
<v Speaker 2>I was terrible too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I spent a lot of my time.</v>

281
00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:20.813
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

282
00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:27.110
<v Speaker 5>you should stay in school kids.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of time showing up to that</v>

283
00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:28.153
<v Speaker 2>building and then immediately turning </v>
<v Speaker 2>back around and going and doing what </v>

284
00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:32.073
<v Speaker 2>interested me.</v>

285
00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:33.560
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and look at you now,</v>

286
00:12:33.561 --> 00:12:36.000
<v Speaker 5>mother fucker.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm doing all right.</v>

287
00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:41.070
<v Speaker 5>But it's finding that thing and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>going after it.</v>

288
00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:45.410
<v Speaker 5>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And what school does is teaches you that</v>

289
00:12:45.411 --> 00:12:46.244
<v Speaker 5>the future is bleak in a lot of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Obviously it educates you and obviously </v>

290
00:12:50.181 --> 00:12:54.020
<v Speaker 5>for people that that go on to choose </v>
<v Speaker 5>some sort of an academic career,</v>

291
00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:55.790
<v Speaker 5>it's imperative.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

292
00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:57.013
<v Speaker 5>But for a lot of people that pushing you</v>
<v Speaker 5>to pay attention to shit you don't want </v>

293
00:13:00.471 --> 00:13:03.380
<v Speaker 5>to pay attention to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it stifles creativity.</v>

294
00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:06.380
<v Speaker 5>It's just not the best way for people to</v>
<v Speaker 5>learn.</v>

295
00:13:06.381 --> 00:13:08.450
<v Speaker 5>It gives you like this horrible feeling </v>
<v Speaker 5>about the future.</v>

296
00:13:08.451 --> 00:13:09.590
<v Speaker 5>Like you feel like an outsider.</v>

297
00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:13.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't feel comfortable at all.</v>

298
00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:15.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean I was constantly trying to figure</v>
<v Speaker 2>out what,</v>

299
00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:16.380
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why,</v>

300
00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:19.920
<v Speaker 2>why am I spending so much time every day</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing this,</v>

301
00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:22.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

302
00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:24.420
<v Speaker 2>I just had other interests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

303
00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:25.263
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that it does work for some </v>

304
00:13:27.871 --> 00:13:30.000
<v Speaker 2>people and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people need it,</v>

305
00:13:30.001 --> 00:13:32.760
<v Speaker 2>but just for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the type of person that I,</v>

306
00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:36.720
<v Speaker 2>that I am,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just like already know what I want</v>

307
00:13:36.721 --> 00:13:37.554
<v Speaker 2>to be doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish I could spend my time doing all </v>

308
00:13:39.571 --> 00:13:40.404
<v Speaker 2>the things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alternative schooling wasn't really an </v>

309
00:13:41.731 --> 00:13:43.980
<v Speaker 2>option for me or anything at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

310
00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:45.490
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

311
00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:46.323
<v Speaker 5>is this an Austin you were growing up?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I grew up at us in the school system </v>

312
00:13:49.001 --> 00:13:49.990
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's pretty bad ass.</v>

313
00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:51.611
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was good.</v>

314
00:13:51.611 --> 00:13:52.444
<v Speaker 5>But I felt like I could,</v>

315
00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:53.843
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would much rather have four hours in </v>

316
00:13:56.741 --> 00:14:00.280
<v Speaker 2>music class and right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doing something else.</v>

317
00:14:00.281 --> 00:14:03.190
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not really knocking the system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just mine,</v>

318
00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:05.170
<v Speaker 2>my interest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

319
00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:06.093
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

320
00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:11.230
<v Speaker 5>I think it's almost impossible to find a</v>
<v Speaker 5>style of teaching or a,</v>

321
00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:12.163
<v Speaker 5>a course of study that's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>really interesting and fascinating to </v>

322
00:14:14.711 --> 00:14:15.610
<v Speaker 5>every kid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

323
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:16.833
<v Speaker 5>It's the problem I think is shoving kids</v>
<v Speaker 5>in classes and trying to educate them </v>

324
00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:25.920
<v Speaker 5>like they're a product like a factory,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

325
00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:27.233
<v Speaker 5>I just don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think the way we do it as the </v>

326
00:14:29.081 --> 00:14:31.450
<v Speaker 5>best way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't have a better solution,</v>

327
00:14:31.451 --> 00:14:33.040
<v Speaker 5>so I have to shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

328
00:14:33.041 --> 00:14:33.940
<v Speaker 5>I don't either.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

329
00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:34.970
<v Speaker 5>I don't either.</v>

330
00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:36.710
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

331
00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:41.180
<v Speaker 2>we had to read that book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brave new world kind of Ooh,</v>

332
00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:42.410
<v Speaker 2>trip me out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

333
00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:46.010
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know if I'm ready for that,</v>

334
00:14:46.011 --> 00:14:47.510
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

335
00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:48.523

<v Speaker 1>actually cooler because your car is like</v>

404
00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:47.840
<v Speaker 1>a car that no one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one gets.</v>

405
00:17:47.841 --> 00:17:48.674

410
00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:01.833
<v Speaker 1>But your car is actually more badass </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's your first car from the </v>

411
00:18:04.681 --> 00:18:09.420
<v Speaker 1>time when you're 19 you still have it </v>
<v Speaker 1>right and you drive it.</v>

412

<v Speaker 2>bring new life of those in a certain way</v>
<v Speaker 2>was different than,</v>

474
00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:52.870
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt like I was kind of stagnant.</v>

475
00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:54.850
<v Speaker 2>Like I wasn't playing drums like I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>every day.</v>

476
00:20:54.851 --> 00:20:56.670
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't playing bass like I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

477
00:20:56.790 --> 00:20:58.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to be a musician,</v>

478
00:20:58.181 --> 00:21:00.490
<v Speaker 2>I want to be all around musician and </v>
<v Speaker 2>push it to the limit.</v>

479
00:21:00.491 --> 00:21:01.324
<v Speaker 2>So for this latest record,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just was able to do that and spend a </v>

480
00:21:05.471 --> 00:21:09.160
<v Speaker 2>lot of time and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>

481
00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:10.870
<v Speaker 2>it does sound different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all me playing,</v>

482
00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:12.033
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of the instruments as opposed to </v>

483
00:21:13.541 --> 00:21:15.430
<v Speaker 2>the last one was a band.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

484
00:21:15.431 --> 00:21:17.350
<v Speaker 2>How many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many different instruments you play?</v>

485
00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:22.030
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess I wouldn't say I play them.</v>

486
00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:26.980
<v Speaker 2>I mess around and some of it works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I played drums,</v>

487
00:21:26.981 --> 00:21:31.720
<v Speaker 2>I played bass keys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

488
00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:34.300
<v Speaker 2>harmonica,</v>
<v Speaker 2>percussion.</v>

489
00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:37.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just kind of the foundation.</v>

490
00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:40.680
<v Speaker 5>And did you take lessons for any of </v>
<v Speaker 5>these,</v>

491
00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:41.743
<v Speaker 5>but formal lessons?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like once you started rolling and you </v>

492
00:21:44.221 --> 00:21:45.240
<v Speaker 5>started becoming a musician?</v>

493
00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:45.660
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

494
00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:46.820
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

495
00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:49.320
<v Speaker 2>I was a choir boy in middle school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

496
00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:50.140
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

497
00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:53.430
<v Speaker 2>I got a hard time for the basketball </v>
<v Speaker 2>team.</v>

498
00:21:53.431 --> 00:21:55.860
<v Speaker 2>Just man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they used to give me a hard time.</v>

499
00:21:55.861 --> 00:21:57.510
<v Speaker 2>So that was the formal training that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>had.</v>

500
00:21:57.511 --> 00:21:59.340
<v Speaker 2>I learned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

501
00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:03.570
<v Speaker 2>scales and notes like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so you can read music,</v>

502
00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:05.663
<v Speaker 2>not really.</v>

503
00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:07.540
<v Speaker 5>You put,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can put it,</v>

504
00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:08.383
<v Speaker 5>you can put a chart</v>

505
00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:11.220
<v Speaker 2>in front of me and I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

506
00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:13.073
<v Speaker 2>no idea.</v>

507
00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:16.920
<v Speaker 5>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's so crazy.</v>

508
00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:18.620
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Musician,</v>

509
00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:21.150
<v Speaker 5>like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're a real musician.</v>

510
00:22:21.151 --> 00:22:23.760
<v Speaker 5>You have like records you with a record </v>
<v Speaker 5>label.</v>

511
00:22:23.761 --> 00:22:24.594
<v Speaker 5>I see your shit and I saw you shared at </v>
<v Speaker 5>the airport once a music video that was </v>

512
00:22:27.841 --> 00:22:29.790
<v Speaker 5>playing on a television.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're like,</v>

513
00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:34.970
<v Speaker 5>you're a professional musician,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I don't read music.</v>

514
00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:38.430
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's like me being a comedian.</v>

515
00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:39.270
<v Speaker 5>That doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

516
00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:39.931
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's worse.</v>

517
00:22:39.931 --> 00:22:42.540
<v Speaker 5>It's like me being an author who doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 5>read</v>

518
00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:44.210
<v Speaker 2>books,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who can't read books.</v>

519
00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:46.880
<v Speaker 2>Does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

520
00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:47.530
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

521
00:22:47.530 --> 00:22:52.530
<v Speaker 5>Jamie says no guy behind me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He didn't play with Hendrix.</v>

522
00:22:53.030 --> 00:22:53.863
<v Speaker 5>You Dj.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got to take that picture down and put </v>

523
00:22:55.061 --> 00:22:56.560
<v Speaker 5>a real one up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Unfortunately,</v>

524
00:22:56.561 --> 00:23:00.670
<v Speaker 5>that's not his real a mugshot photo.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a real photo obviously,</v>

525
00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:02.650
<v Speaker 5>but that's not the actual four.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They fucked me,</v>

526
00:23:02.651 --> 00:23:03.910
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I bought this shit.</v>

527
00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:06.180
<v Speaker 5>That's Rosa parks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Real mugshot photo though.</v>

528
00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:10.050
<v Speaker 5>The Elvis one is real,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's not really a mugshot.</v>

529
00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:10.893
<v Speaker 5>It was when he went to visit Nixon in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the White House or took a photo of him </v>

530
00:23:13.541 --> 00:23:14.374
<v Speaker 5>for goof.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that's just a classic picture of </v>

531
00:23:17.831 --> 00:23:18.664
<v Speaker 5>Hendrix.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then they put his actual mugshot </v>

532
00:23:20.681 --> 00:23:21.950
<v Speaker 5>photo,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

533
00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:22.793
<v Speaker 5>underneath it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's real photo was him with like </v>

534
00:23:24.311 --> 00:23:27.670
<v Speaker 5>shorter hair.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It looked more like a classic Afro.</v>

535
00:23:27.671 --> 00:23:28.504
<v Speaker 5>That's like Jimi Hendrix experience when</v>
<v Speaker 5>they had those white dudes behind him </v>

536
00:23:31.421 --> 00:23:33.620
<v Speaker 5>with the big Afros as well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

537
00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:35.150
<v Speaker 5>That's his real photo.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

538
00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:36.700
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you see the,</v>

539
00:23:36.701 --> 00:23:39.920
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the image is correct for the Mugshot,</v>

540
00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:42.310
<v Speaker 5>like for his name,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's the wrong photo.</v>

541
00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:44.083
<v Speaker 2>They fucked me.</v>

542
00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:47.500
<v Speaker 1>Somebody had to tell me thank you ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>told me some,</v>

543
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:49.340
<v Speaker 1>some dude online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me know.</v>

544
00:23:49.341 --> 00:23:50.960

<v Speaker 1>that ain't the real one.</v>

545

<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck right assholes.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

547
00:23:54.951 --> 00:23:58.780
<v Speaker 1>that looks like the perfect arrest photo</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Jimmy Hendrix.</v>

548
00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:01.780
<v Speaker 1>And he also has this looking at his </v>
<v Speaker 1>face.</v>

549
00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:02.623
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe these motherfuckers who </v>

550
00:24:03.721 --> 00:24:06.320
<v Speaker 1>arrested me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's the other one?</v>

551
00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:08.000
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got the look like,</v>

552
00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:10.310
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just got fucking arrested for heroin.</v>

553
00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:15.300
<v Speaker 1>That's a different look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

556
00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:20.250
<v Speaker 1>I can't let,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God dammit I get tea.</v>

557
00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:22.070
<v Speaker 1>I take the picture man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit,</v>

558
00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:28.030
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a obviously a huge Hendrix fan and I</v>

559
00:24:28.461 --> 00:24:29.294
<v Speaker 1>can't bring myself to read.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had a former bodyguard that wrote </v>

560
00:24:32.421 --> 00:24:35.900
<v Speaker 1>some book that claims that his ex </v>
<v Speaker 1>manager had him killed.</v>

561
00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:40.310
<v Speaker 1>That Hendricks manager not only had him </v>
<v Speaker 1>killed but even had him kidnapped at one</v>

562
00:24:40.311 --> 00:24:41.144
<v Speaker 1>point in time just so he could rescue </v>
<v Speaker 1>him cause hendricks is going to leave </v>

563
00:24:43.881 --> 00:24:44.714
<v Speaker 1>his manager.</v>

564
00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:46.183
<v Speaker 1>They also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy also alleges that hendricks </v>

565
00:24:47.991 --> 00:24:52.670
<v Speaker 1>manager killed hendricks girlfriend who </v>
<v Speaker 1>was with him at the time that he died.</v>

566
00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:55.820
<v Speaker 1>Like she jumped off a building in Soho,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe.</v>

567
00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:57.130
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>

568
00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:57.993
<v Speaker 1>they think that they threw her off that </v>
<v Speaker 1>building because she knew that this guy </v>

569
00:25:01.581 --> 00:25:06.050
<v Speaker 1>had killed Hendrix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I can't bring myself to it.</v>

573
00:25:10.530 --> 00:25:11.363
<v Speaker 1>I can't either because I don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get down some rabbit hole that I can't </v>

574
00:25:14.001 --> 00:25:15.620
<v Speaker 1>prove.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this guy who was a,</v>

575
00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:18.080
<v Speaker 1>he was a musician himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was with the animals,</v>

576
00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:20.570
<v Speaker 1>I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I forget the song,</v>

579
00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:29.173

<v Speaker 1>he was actually a musician himself and </v>

580
00:25:30.501 --> 00:25:31.334
<v Speaker 1>it didn't work out for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he started working as a bodyguard </v>

581
00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:35.600
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

582
00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:37.273
<v Speaker 1>for Hendricks and working with this </v>
<v Speaker 1>manager character who was apparently </v>

583
00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:42.140
<v Speaker 1>like universally known as like a really </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad guy,</v>

584
00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:45.800
<v Speaker 1>like real shady.</v>

<v Speaker 1>like a lot of dangerous people like Phil</v>

<v Speaker 1>it doesn't get any crazier than that </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

592
00:26:03.741 --> 00:26:05.400
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't know who Phil Spector </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

593
00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:07.070
<v Speaker 1>you'll google him and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

594
00:26:07.071 --> 00:26:08.930
<v Speaker 1>how come his hair looks like this in one</v>
<v Speaker 1>picture?</v>

595
00:26:08.931 --> 00:26:09.764
<v Speaker 1>And it has hair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he wore a bunch of crazy wigs when </v>

596
00:26:11.181 --> 00:26:12.014
<v Speaker 1>he got arrested for shooting a woman in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mouth just a few years ago and a </v>

597
00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:16.593
<v Speaker 1>killer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he picked up some woman at a bar on </v>

598
00:26:19.101 --> 00:26:21.980
<v Speaker 1>sunset,</v>
<v Speaker 1>took it back to his mansion and shot her</v>

599
00:26:21.981 --> 00:26:24.050
<v Speaker 1>in the mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

600
00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:26.660
<v Speaker 1>he was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that guy was famous for like putting</v>

601
00:26:26.661 --> 00:26:27.494
<v Speaker 1>guns in people's mouths.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a famous for pulling guns on </v>

602
00:26:29.661 --> 00:26:33.830
<v Speaker 1>people and apparently it was just a big </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the music business back then.</v>

603
00:26:33.831 --> 00:26:34.664
<v Speaker 1>It was organized crime and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous people with ties to organized </v>

604
00:26:37.191 --> 00:26:39.890
<v Speaker 1>crime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this guy who managed Hendrix,</v>

605
00:26:39.910 --> 00:26:43.980
<v Speaker 1>Hendrix apparently wanted to leave him </v>
<v Speaker 1>and as he was on his way</v>

606
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:44.813
<v Speaker 5>out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's when this guy had the Hendrix </v>

607
00:26:45.751 --> 00:26:46.584
<v Speaker 5>kidnapped.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is what they are alleging in the </v>

608
00:26:48.241 --> 00:26:49.074
<v Speaker 5>book and I believe it's been confirmed </v>
<v Speaker 5>that Hendricks was kidnapped and this </v>

609
00:26:52.441 --> 00:26:54.000
<v Speaker 5>guy did,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

610
00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:55.493
<v Speaker 5>get him rescued the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He had him kidnapped so he could rescue </v>

611
00:26:58.801 --> 00:26:59.650
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So He'd say,</v>

709
00:31:26.510 --> 00:31:27.343
<v Speaker 1>If you're even thinking about going down</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a girl and you have to throw a </v>

729
00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:11.090

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

732
00:32:14.150 --> 00:32:14.983
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's getting closer and closer to being </v>

733
00:32:15.711 --> 00:32:16.520
<v Speaker 1>legal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

734
00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:18.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just,</v>

735
00:32:18.021 --> 00:32:20.150

736
00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:21.013
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new financial stats on the amount of </v>

737
00:32:22.251 --> 00:32:24.590
<v Speaker 1>money that they're making off medical </v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana once,</v>

738
00:32:24.650 --> 00:32:25.483
<v Speaker 1>if they can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they can really establish that this </v>

739
00:32:27.381 --> 00:32:28.214
<v Speaker 1>is like a nationwide way that people can</v>
<v Speaker 1>make a ton of money off taxes and turn </v>

740
00:32:31.821 --> 00:32:33.440
<v Speaker 1>economies around it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They haven't Denver,</v>

741
00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:35.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they turn the economy in Denver around.</v>

742
00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:36.740
<v Speaker 1>Do you perform there a lot?</v>

743
00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:40.160
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a lot.</v>

744
00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:42.650
<v Speaker 5>I'm trying to get there more.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

745
00:32:42.651 --> 00:32:43.670
<v Speaker 5>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

746
00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:45.950
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't belly up a couple of times </v>
<v Speaker 5>and done some,</v>

747
00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:48.290
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

748
00:32:48.410 --> 00:32:49.820
<v Speaker 5>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

749
00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:51.770
<v Speaker 5>a couple of times.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of beautiful venue.</v>

750
00:32:51.771 --> 00:32:52.550
<v Speaker 5>That is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Huh?</v>

751
00:32:52.550 --> 00:32:53.510
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's great.</v>

752
00:32:53.511 --> 00:32:56.830
<v Speaker 5>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the vibe is killed.</v>

753
00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:59.090
<v Speaker 5>It's a great experience as far as every,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all that,</v>

754
00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:01.550
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Denver vibe is like,</v>

755
00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:04.460
<v Speaker 5>it's like some new American Amsterdam </v>
<v Speaker 5>type shit or something.</v>

756
00:33:04.461 --> 00:33:07.490
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's this amazing city now.</v>

757
00:33:07.670 --> 00:33:10.610
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it went from being this cowboy city that</v>

758
00:33:10.611 --> 00:33:13.700
<v Speaker 5>was filled with really cool people to </v>
<v Speaker 5>somewhere,</v>

759
00:33:13.701 --> 00:33:16.910
<v Speaker 5>I think in the early two thousands,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember what the year it was.</v>

760
00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:19.970
<v Speaker 5>They decriminalized marijuana in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>city of Denver.</v>

761
00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:20.840
<v Speaker 5>They just went,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck it.</v>

762
00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:22.790
<v Speaker 5>We're just not arresting anybody for it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a stupid,</v>

763
00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:23.953
<v Speaker 5>they like you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could have all your state laws you </v>

764
00:33:25.161 --> 00:33:26.210
<v Speaker 5>can have on your national laws.</v>

765
00:33:26.210 --> 00:33:27.740
<v Speaker 5>We're just not going to arrest people </v>
<v Speaker 5>for it.</v>

766
00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:28.693
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're done.</v>

767
00:33:29.030 --> 00:33:31.220
<v Speaker 5>And so they would tell us that when </v>
<v Speaker 5>we're working.</v>

768
00:33:31.221 --> 00:33:32.150
<v Speaker 5>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

769
00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:32.871
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

770
00:33:32.871 --> 00:33:34.460
<v Speaker 5>they don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could smoke pot.</v>

771
00:33:34.461 --> 00:33:35.294
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really?</v>

772
00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:37.010
<v Speaker 5>Like yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they won't arrest you.</v>

773
00:33:37.011 --> 00:33:38.540
<v Speaker 5>They publicly said they won't arrest </v>
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>

774
00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:41.060
<v Speaker 5>So there was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was the first stepping point.</v>

775
00:33:41.390 --> 00:33:42.223
<v Speaker 5>And then when it became legal and now </v>
<v Speaker 5>they make more money from it than they </v>

776
00:33:45.501 --> 00:33:47.840
<v Speaker 5>do from alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is incredible.</v>

777
00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:50.330
<v Speaker 5>They make more money in tax because the </v>
<v Speaker 5>taxes are very high.</v>

778
00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:53.540
<v Speaker 5>Like it's 39% taxes for recreational </v>
<v Speaker 5>marijuana.</v>

779
00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:57.590
<v Speaker 5>But nobody gives a fuck because it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>still way cheaper than alcohol.</v>

780
00:33:57.860 --> 00:34:02.180
<v Speaker 5>Like you could get $10 for the weed and </v>
<v Speaker 5>be fucked up for the entire day.</v>

781
00:34:03.170 --> 00:34:04.310
<v Speaker 5>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

782
00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:07.940
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you take one $5 pot candy,</v>

783
00:34:08.990 --> 00:34:11.550
<v Speaker 5>so what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's 39% taxes.</v>

784
00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:12.620
<v Speaker 5>What does that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so that makes it,</v>

785
00:34:12.621 --> 00:34:13.454
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>eight bucks?</v>

786
00:34:13.670 --> 00:34:14.503
<v Speaker 5>So then you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then you take that one pot candy and </v>

787
00:34:17.271 --> 00:34:19.020
<v Speaker 5>your barbecued,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

788
00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:21.410
<v Speaker 5>That's one jamison.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

789
00:34:21.470 --> 00:34:22.910
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's one drink.</v>

790
00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:23.833
<v Speaker 5>It's like not even close.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So like economically it's a great thing </v>

791
00:34:26.391 --> 00:34:27.980
<v Speaker 5>for the city.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And once,</v>

792
00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:31.220
<v Speaker 5>once that sort of sets in that we've </v>
<v Speaker 5>been lied to about that.</v>

793
00:34:31.221 --> 00:34:32.840
<v Speaker 5>And then all these new studies are </v>
<v Speaker 5>coming out,</v>

794
00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:34.430
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>about the,</v>

795
00:34:34.431 --> 00:34:37.730
<v Speaker 5>the benefits of a different psychedelics</v>
<v Speaker 5>for ptsd.</v>

796
00:34:38.570 --> 00:34:41.540
<v Speaker 5>A John Hopkins did a longterm study on </v>
<v Speaker 5>silicide been,</v>

797
00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:42.613
<v Speaker 5>they're doing new studies on psilocybin </v>
<v Speaker 5>with people that are terminally ill and </v>

798
00:34:45.891 --> 00:34:46.910
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people that are,</v>

799
00:34:46.911 --> 00:34:49.220
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're getting towards the end of life,</v>

800
00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:50.083
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>older folks and it's just a alleviated </v>

801
00:34:51.741 --> 00:34:55.340
<v Speaker 5>tension and worry and fear of death and </v>
<v Speaker 5>in a beautiful way.</v>

802
00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:57.110
<v Speaker 5>And then they'll realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

803
00:34:57.111 --> 00:34:58.490
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we can profit off this shit.</v>

804
00:34:58.491 --> 00:35:01.400
<v Speaker 5>Like this is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is more money that can be generated</v>

805
00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:04.880
<v Speaker 5>to help the school systems,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the fix the roads to hire new cops to,</v>

806
00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:07.040
<v Speaker 5>to change the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

807
00:35:07.041 --> 00:35:07.611
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>

808
00:35:07.611 --> 00:35:08.444
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>address and interface with these things </v>

809
00:35:10.401 --> 00:35:12.110
<v Speaker 5>and stop,</v>
<v Speaker 5>stop criminalizing them.</v>

810
00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:13.191
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

811
00:35:13.191 --> 00:35:14.024
<v Speaker 5>I totally agree.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not as educated on all that as I </v>

812
00:35:16.251 --> 00:35:17.810
<v Speaker 5>would like to be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I feel like,</v>

813
00:35:18.530 --> 00:35:19.880
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

814
00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:22.390
<v Speaker 5>once that door gets opened up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

815
00:35:22.650 --> 00:35:24.560
<v Speaker 5>it'd be a lot more beneficial than it </v>
<v Speaker 5>is.</v>

816
00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:27.080
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>hurting.</v>

818
00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:29.750
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

819
00:35:29.751 --> 00:35:33.620
<v Speaker 5>we're just stuck in the momentum of an </v>
<v Speaker 5>ignorant past.</v>

820
00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:35.740
<v Speaker 5>It's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I'm saying?</v>

821
00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:36.653

<v Speaker 1>Freaking out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hitting Midlife,</v>

864
00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:14.420
<v Speaker 1>wondering what the fuck they're doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with themselves.</v>

865
00:37:14.421 --> 00:37:18.140
<v Speaker 1>Having children being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being trapped in some job where there,</v>

866
00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:19.133
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most likely with the people that go the </v>

867
00:37:21.141 --> 00:37:24.770
<v Speaker 1>way that everybody wanted us to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like whether it's a lawyer or successful</v>

868
00:37:24.771 --> 00:37:25.604
<v Speaker 1>businessman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're stressed the fuck out working </v>

869
00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:28.670
<v Speaker 1>long crazy hours.</v>

870
00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:30.280
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

871
00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:32.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I totally agree.</v>

872
00:37:32.851 --> 00:37:36.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like regardless of,</v>

873
00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:39.510
<v Speaker 2>or despite the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

874
00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:42.090
<v Speaker 2>the tension that I had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

875
00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:44.520
<v Speaker 2>I grew up constantly very strict,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

876
00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.640
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

877
00:37:46.650 --> 00:37:49.110
<v Speaker 2>I was raised baptist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

878
00:37:49.710 --> 00:37:52.530
<v Speaker 2>very straight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very strict family,</v>

879
00:37:52.590 --> 00:37:53.423
<v Speaker 2>military.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So any of that was completely taboo and </v>

880
00:37:58.261 --> 00:37:59.094
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be my ass if they found out </v>

881
00:38:00.211 --> 00:38:02.670
<v Speaker 2>anything about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But for some reason I felt like I wanted</v>

882
00:38:02.671 --> 00:38:05.910
<v Speaker 2>to break out and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and discover on my own,</v>

883
00:38:05.911 --> 00:38:06.744
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And not kind of not be locked into what </v>

884
00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:12.570
<v Speaker 2>was just laid out for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

885
00:38:12.650 --> 00:38:13.141
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

886
00:38:13.141 --> 00:38:14.130
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>

887
00:38:14.131 --> 00:38:15.930
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It turned out being the right crowd,</v>

888
00:38:16.750 --> 00:38:21.750
<v Speaker 1>not doing great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just seems to be a common theme.</v>

889
00:38:21.881 --> 00:38:24.100
<v Speaker 1>Suppression leads to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

890
00:38:24.101 --> 00:38:24.934
<v Speaker 1>trying to alleviate that suppression by </v>
<v Speaker 1>this not listening well by you just </v>

891
00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:31.510
<v Speaker 1>going crazy by your exploring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking chances.</v>

892
00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:34.000
<v Speaker 1>Oftentimes like the most strict </v>
<v Speaker 1>upbringings,</v>

893
00:38:34.330 --> 00:38:39.330
<v Speaker 1>but deliver a child is like more prone </v>
<v Speaker 1>to rebellion and I just,</v>

894
00:38:40.271 --> 00:38:42.190
<v Speaker 1>kids don't like to be told what the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>

895
00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:44.411
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

896
00:38:44.411 --> 00:38:47.170
<v Speaker 1>You're there.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And I'm sure you're probably going to </v>

899
00:38:53.321 --> 00:38:56.800
<v Speaker 1>impart that into your own children too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you kind of remember,</v>

900
00:38:56.801 --> 00:38:59.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I certainly do with my children.</v>

901
00:38:59.051 --> 00:39:02.710
<v Speaker 1>I remember being told what to do and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just you strapped me fucking crazy.</v>

902
00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:04.730
<v Speaker 1>People don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

903
00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:05.500
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

904
00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:08.620

<v Speaker 1>coins and then they start sticking </v>
<v Speaker 1>things in there.</v>

922
00:39:41.890 --> 00:39:46.480
<v Speaker 1>Blowing my mind right now anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>they're fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're little people.</v>

925
00:39:49.970 --> 00:39:52.130
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

926
00:39:52.131 --> 00:39:52.964
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

927
00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:55.110
<v Speaker 2>definitely be conscious of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

928
00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:56.930
<v Speaker 2>of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

929
00:39:56.940 --> 00:39:58.100
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as he grows and,</v>

930
00:39:58.220 --> 00:40:00.920
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

931
00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:03.930
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't mind questioning why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

932
00:40:04.170 --> 00:40:06.080
<v Speaker 2>There's the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>

933
00:40:06.110 --> 00:40:07.310
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I said,</v>

934
00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:08.310
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

935
00:40:08.570 --> 00:40:09.710
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>

936
00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:11.000
<v Speaker 2>can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

937
00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:16.780
<v Speaker 2>I can't do that to this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It drives me fucking nuts.</v>

938
00:40:17.650 --> 00:40:18.910
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

939
00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:23.940
<v Speaker 1>I have a theory on all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that every generation gathers up</v>

940
00:40:24.551 --> 00:40:27.460
<v Speaker 1>the information of how the previous </v>
<v Speaker 1>generation fucked up.</v>

941
00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:28.503
<v Speaker 1>And as long as there's no cataclysmic </v>
<v Speaker 1>disasters and we're not living in Mad </v>

942
00:40:31.930 --> 00:40:32.763
<v Speaker 1>Max Times where it's like desperado days</v>
<v Speaker 1>and everyone's fending for themselves </v>

943
00:40:36.791 --> 00:40:39.820
<v Speaker 1>and it's just about survival,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then things just keep getting better.</v>

944
00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:41.013
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well now you can pull out your mobile </v>

945
00:40:42.941 --> 00:40:43.070
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>

946
00:40:43.070 --> 00:40:47.180
<v Speaker 2>vice and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out what's really happening,</v>

947
00:40:47.330 --> 00:40:48.250
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

948
00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:50.210
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

949
00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:53.120
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of a trip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

950
00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:54.103
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to kind of grow up in and just not </v>

951
00:40:57.471 --> 00:40:58.304
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

952
00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:02.270
<v Speaker 2>not have access.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we have access now.</v>

953
00:41:03.050 --> 00:41:05.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it still blows my mind like that.</v>

954
00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:10.370
<v Speaker 2>I forget sometimes that if I want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>know something I can just google.</v>

955
00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:11.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instant.</v>

956
00:41:11.250 --> 00:41:13.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing.</v>

957
00:41:13.310 --> 00:41:14.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

958
00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:17.930
<v Speaker 2>So I saw something you were talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about these google glasses and like,</v>

959
00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:22.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these whole being,</v>

960
00:41:22.430 --> 00:41:24.500
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it is,</v>

961
00:41:24.530 --> 00:41:29.000
<v Speaker 2>it's a my buddy Chris was trying to tell</v>
<v Speaker 2>me about it as well.</v>

962
00:41:29.370 --> 00:41:32.280
<v Speaker 1>Well there's a bunch of different kinds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the regular google glasses,</v>

963
00:41:32.281 --> 00:41:34.040
<v Speaker 1>which a lot of people have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a very small</v>

964
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:36.680
<v Speaker 5>lens.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It sits on like a mock frames.</v>

965
00:41:36.681 --> 00:41:39.290
<v Speaker 5>It looks like a glass frame without any </v>
<v Speaker 5>glasses in it.</v>

966
00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:43.220
<v Speaker 5>And then there's one small window but </v>
<v Speaker 5>that didn't really catch on.</v>

967
00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:47.720
<v Speaker 5>So what they're working on now is a </v>
<v Speaker 5>contact lenses that do the same thing.</v>

968
00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:48.531
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the Google,</v>

969
00:41:48.531 --> 00:41:49.364
<v Speaker 5>the glass thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you had like a little swipe thing and </v>

970
00:41:52.251 --> 00:41:54.890
<v Speaker 5>you could like swipe left and right and </v>
<v Speaker 5>move it around.</v>

971
00:41:54.891 --> 00:41:56.870
<v Speaker 5>Like so he could go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I could say,</v>

972
00:41:56.871 --> 00:41:57.704
<v Speaker 5>I could Google Gary Clark images and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>would see in that little tiny window </v>

973
00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:04.550
<v Speaker 5>images of you and I could just swipe </v>
<v Speaker 5>through them.</v>

974
00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:08.810
<v Speaker 5>You could say navigate to the Hollywood </v>
<v Speaker 5>bowl.</v>

975
00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:11.750
<v Speaker 5>And it would take,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it would show you google maps,</v>

976
00:42:11.930 --> 00:42:14.450
<v Speaker 5>how to get to the Hollywood bowl and he </v>
<v Speaker 5>would talk to you in your ear.</v>

977
00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:17.330
<v Speaker 5>But people didn't like it cause it </v>
<v Speaker 5>looked goofy and,</v>

978
00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:20.360
<v Speaker 5>and when people were wearing them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>other people got pissed off.</v>

979
00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:22.310
<v Speaker 5>Like are you filming me?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what are you doing?</v>

980
00:42:22.311 --> 00:42:25.460
<v Speaker 5>Cause you could fill them with them too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So now they're,</v>

981
00:42:25.461 --> 00:42:26.294
<v Speaker 5>they've moved to contact lenses,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which they haven't really released yet </v>

982
00:42:29.061 --> 00:42:29.894
<v Speaker 5>but they're working on them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then there's another one that's way </v>

983
00:42:31.431 --> 00:42:33.800
<v Speaker 5>crazier,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is like goggles and these are like</v>

984
00:42:33.801 --> 00:42:36.620
<v Speaker 5>ski goggles and when you put these </v>
<v Speaker 5>motherfuckers on,</v>

985
00:42:36.621 --> 00:42:39.650
<v Speaker 5>you're going to be able to play video </v>
<v Speaker 5>games in three d space.</v>

986
00:42:39.830 --> 00:42:43.430
<v Speaker 5>You're going to have like three </v>
<v Speaker 5>dimensional holograms around you.</v>

987
00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:45.770
<v Speaker 5>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the thing I was wondering about.</v>

988
00:42:45.830 --> 00:42:46.663
<v Speaker 5>So called magic leap or now magically </v>
<v Speaker 5>visit one magic leap in the Hollow Lens </v>

989
00:42:50.211 --> 00:42:52.520
<v Speaker 5>by Microsoft.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the one with the goggles,</v>

990
00:42:52.521 --> 00:42:53.570
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Hollow Lens.</v>

991
00:42:54.410 --> 00:42:56.060
<v Speaker 5>But yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What are you thinking about that?</v>

992
00:42:56.090 --> 00:42:58.460
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is just step one.</v>

993
00:42:58.610 --> 00:42:59.443
<v Speaker 5>I've actually been talking about this </v>
<v Speaker 5>onstage recently because I'm actually </v>

994
00:43:01.550 --> 00:43:05.510
<v Speaker 5>kind of freaked out about it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that we're going to enter a world within</v>

995
00:43:05.511 --> 00:43:06.344
<v Speaker 5>the next hundred years where artificial </v>
<v Speaker 5>reality is indistinguishable from </v>

996
00:43:09.981 --> 00:43:10.880
<v Speaker 5>regular reality.</v>

997
00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:12.433
<v Speaker 5>It's the matrix.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's 100% going to happen if we don't </v>

998
00:43:15.141 --> 00:43:17.780
<v Speaker 5>blow ourselves up and we don't die from </v>
<v Speaker 5>disease.</v>

999
00:43:17.781 --> 00:43:18.614
<v Speaker 5>If we don't get hit by an asteroid,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're going to be able to figure out a </v>

1000
00:43:21.861 --> 00:43:22.694
<v Speaker 5>way to trick the mind into thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's experiencing things that it's not </v>

1001
00:43:25.851 --> 00:43:26.684
<v Speaker 5>experiencing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whether how long it takes is just </v>

1002
00:43:29.031 --> 00:43:32.150
<v Speaker 5>subjective,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but whatever the amount of time it is in</v>

1003
00:43:32.151 --> 00:43:34.760
<v Speaker 5>the history of the universe or the </v>
<v Speaker 5>history of this planet,</v>

1004
00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:35.623
<v Speaker 5>it's a blink and in one blank,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're not going to be able to tell </v>

1005
00:43:38.690 --> 00:43:39.523
<v Speaker 5>where the reality is real or not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're going to be able to plug into </v>

1006
00:43:41.810 --> 00:43:44.540
<v Speaker 5>something and you're going to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 5>have artificial experiences.</v>

1007
00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:46.880
<v Speaker 5>So like we could do this like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

1008
00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:48.710
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we might be doing it right now.</v>

1009
00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:51.260
<v Speaker 5>That's what's fucked up about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When,</v>

1010
00:43:51.290 --> 00:43:52.123
<v Speaker 5>when scientists study artificial reality</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they study what they call computer </v>

1011
00:43:55.641 --> 00:43:58.850
<v Speaker 5>simulation theory,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're the real mind fuck is.</v>

1012
00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:00.013
<v Speaker 5>It's hard to tell whether or not this is</v>
<v Speaker 5>a simulation and that it's very likely </v>

1013
00:44:05.721 --> 00:44:10.520
<v Speaker 5>that it could be that our entire </v>
<v Speaker 5>universe could be some sort of a massive</v>

1014
00:44:10.521 --> 00:44:11.354
<v Speaker 5>simulation that we're experiencing and </v>
<v Speaker 5>might not even be like a computer </v>

1015
00:44:14.271 --> 00:44:15.104
<v Speaker 5>simulation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It might be some sort of a simulation </v>

1016
00:44:17.031 --> 00:44:19.520
<v Speaker 5>that's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like at a cellular level,</v>

1017
00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:22.430
<v Speaker 5>like some sort of a mass hallucination.</v>

1018
00:44:25.610 --> 00:44:26.600
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1019
00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:29.660
<v Speaker 5>It's emily isn't enough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was not my theories,</v>

1020
00:44:29.661 --> 00:44:34.050
<v Speaker 5>but I think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These are not my ideas.</v>

1021
00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:34.973
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't even know what to say about </v>

1022
00:44:38.110 --> 00:44:38.943
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Think about what you said right about </v>

1023
00:44:40.171 --> 00:44:43.200
<v Speaker 5>Google Ryan,</v>
<v Speaker 5>about being able to go to your phone and</v>

1024
00:44:43.201 --> 00:44:45.570
<v Speaker 5>have it all the answers when you were a </v>
<v Speaker 5>kid.</v>

1025
00:44:45.660 --> 00:44:48.300
<v Speaker 5>That was magic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was magic,</v>

1026
00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:50.610
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The idea behind that was insane.</v>

1027
00:44:50.611 --> 00:44:51.444
<v Speaker 5>Just 20 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>1996 the idea of being able to do that </v>

1028
00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:56.430
<v Speaker 5>was insane.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody be like,</v>

1029
00:44:56.431 --> 00:44:59.360
<v Speaker 5>what in the fuck are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're going to be to reach a new phone.</v>

1030
00:44:59.361 --> 00:45:00.900
<v Speaker 5>You've gotta be able to touch a piece of</v>
<v Speaker 5>glass.</v>

1031
00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:02.340
<v Speaker 5>You can not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you didn't have to touch it.</v>

1032
00:45:02.341 --> 00:45:03.174
<v Speaker 5>You press a button and you talk to it </v>
<v Speaker 5>and it'll tell you anything you need to </v>

1033
00:45:06.121 --> 00:45:07.410
<v Speaker 5>know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what?</v>

1034
00:45:07.770 --> 00:45:10.560
<v Speaker 5>How the fuck is that possible?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're going to go watch videos on it.</v>

1035
00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:13.140
<v Speaker 5>Shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're going to watch movies on it.</v>

1036
00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:14.253
<v Speaker 5>You're gonna be able to play hundreds </v>
<v Speaker 5>and hundreds and hundreds of hours of </v>

1037
00:45:16.921 --> 00:45:17.754
<v Speaker 5>music on it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It'll sound beautiful and it all be a </v>

1038
00:45:19.591 --> 00:45:22.260
<v Speaker 5>thing that's so slim and sleek.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It fits right in your pocket.</v>

1039
00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:26.490
<v Speaker 5>Like we're already living in some crazy </v>
<v Speaker 5>movie that they didn't even predict.</v>

1040
00:45:26.491 --> 00:45:31.491
<v Speaker 5>And Star track a sidetrack.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They had walkie talkies number.</v>

1041
00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:34.320
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is crazy.</v>

1042
00:45:36.210 --> 00:45:39.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm just getting old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does this Jamie,</v>

1043
00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:43.680
<v Speaker 2>Microsoft added a new update to what </v>
<v Speaker 2>hollow lens is going to look like.</v>

1044
00:45:43.681 --> 00:45:44.514
<v Speaker 2>This is what they think is watching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sports will be like in the future kind </v>

1045
00:45:46.761 --> 00:45:48.660
<v Speaker 2>of says like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Watching football.</v>

1046
00:45:49.110 --> 00:45:49.943
<v Speaker 2>A football game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1047
00:45:51.830 --> 00:45:53.460
<v Speaker 1>Oh you be able to watch it in front of </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1048
00:45:55.380 --> 00:45:59.400
<v Speaker 1>All sorts of players.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can have players in stats pop up and</v>

1049
00:45:59.401 --> 00:46:03.240
<v Speaker 1>you're like living room and get extra.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks really,</v>

1050
00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:07.380
<v Speaker 1>so everyone's just going to sit down and</v>
<v Speaker 1>put these goggles on instead of having a</v>

1051
00:46:07.381 --> 00:46:11.580
<v Speaker 1>television or with the television.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you'll have access to TV.</v>

1052
00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:12.533
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could only imagine what like a UFC </v>

1053
00:46:15.301 --> 00:46:17.130
<v Speaker 1>event watching that would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

1054
00:46:17.131 --> 00:46:20.100
<v Speaker 1>To get extra stats on the players will </v>
<v Speaker 1>be really cool.</v>

1055
00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:20.993
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably we'll put a big camera on the </v>

1056
00:46:22.951 --> 00:46:27.690
<v Speaker 1>referee so you'd be inside of it are </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching me watching from their view,</v>

1057
00:46:27.691 --> 00:46:28.524
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watching from any players view if you </v>

1058
00:46:29.551 --> 00:46:31.200
<v Speaker 1>choose to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they can pull that off with,</v>

1059
00:46:31.580 --> 00:46:33.600
<v Speaker 1>well they probably could do that with </v>
<v Speaker 1>players.</v>

1060
00:46:33.601 --> 00:46:34.920
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't be able to do it with </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighters.</v>

1061
00:46:34.921 --> 00:46:38.160
<v Speaker 1>But with the pride,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they used to have a camera,</v>

1062
00:46:38.190 --> 00:46:41.130
<v Speaker 1>but they would put on the referees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was this crazy dorky thing.</v>

1063
00:46:41.390 --> 00:46:42.223
<v Speaker 5>It was like real big and clunky.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was like a camera that's sat next to </v>

1064
00:46:44.251 --> 00:46:45.960
<v Speaker 5>their head and they would,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1065
00:46:45.990 --> 00:46:46.823
<v Speaker 5>they would wear that thing and it was </v>
<v Speaker 5>kind of cool to see it from their </v>

1066
00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:50.513
<v Speaker 5>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that was fairly rudimentary </v>

1067
00:46:53.161 --> 00:46:55.080
<v Speaker 5>considering it was like early two </v>
<v Speaker 5>thousands,</v>

1068
00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:57.630
<v Speaker 5>like what this is going to be is going </v>
<v Speaker 5>to be bananas,</v>

1069
00:46:58.050 --> 00:46:59.670
<v Speaker 5>but then you got to hang out with </v>
<v Speaker 5>goggles on,</v>

1070
00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:03.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>friends have to have goggles.</v>

1071
00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:07.580
<v Speaker 2>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1072
00:47:07.581 --> 00:47:08.750
<v Speaker 2>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess it's,</v>

1073
00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:11.330
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of like the silent disco </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

1074
00:47:11.870 --> 00:47:15.620
<v Speaker 2>What's the silent disco thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A silent disco is like where people,</v>

1075
00:47:15.710 --> 00:47:16.543
<v Speaker 2>like a whole bunch of people hang out in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a room or a club and they have </v>

1076
00:47:20.151 --> 00:47:20.984
<v Speaker 2>headphones on and there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's Djs and you can decide if you </v>

1077
00:47:25.161 --> 00:47:27.770
<v Speaker 2>want to go with Dj,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Dj be.</v>

1078
00:47:28.010 --> 00:47:31.720
<v Speaker 2>And so it was a bunch of people like </v>
<v Speaker 2>dancing in a silent room with headphones</v>

1079
00:47:31.721 --> 00:47:34.180
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really like having a great time.</v>

1080
00:47:35.070 --> 00:47:37.720
<v Speaker 2>And then it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you want to drink?</v>

1081
00:47:37.990 --> 00:47:38.823
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

1082
00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:42.540
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this it right here?</v>

1083
00:47:42.541 --> 00:47:47.541
<v Speaker 1>You show me this Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is people the dancing around and</v>

1084
00:47:50.101 --> 00:47:52.110
<v Speaker 1>they just have different wireless </v>
<v Speaker 1>headsets on.</v>

1085
00:47:52.170 --> 00:47:53.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1086
00:47:53.610 --> 00:47:56.250
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh this is crazy.</v>

1087
00:47:58.870 --> 00:47:59.630
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

1088
00:47:59.630 --> 00:48:00.980
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's just listening to the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1089
00:48:00.981 --> 00:48:02.990
<v Speaker 1>There's just no out like no one outside </v>
<v Speaker 1>can hear you.</v>

1090
00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:06.800
<v Speaker 1>Well that's good to your neighbors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>

1091
00:48:06.801 --> 00:48:08.330
<v Speaker 1>In that way it's great for your </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighbors.</v>

1092
00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:09.193
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to be rude because it's </v>

1093
00:48:10.461 --> 00:48:15.461
<v Speaker 1>like that one asshole on your block who </v>
<v Speaker 1>has a party but his music tastes sox.</v>

1094
00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:17.293
<v Speaker 1>There was this part of that they had </v>
<v Speaker 1>near my neighborhood about 10 years ago </v>

1095
00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:25.240
<v Speaker 1>and it was the most fucking depressing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like trapped in the,</v>

1096
00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:26.513
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh let me try to remember what kind of </v>

1097
00:48:28.311 --> 00:48:30.200
<v Speaker 1>music there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was like the captain and to kneel</v>

1098
00:48:30.201 --> 00:48:32.270
<v Speaker 1>or some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was so bad.</v>

1099
00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:34.550
<v Speaker 1>It was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how would they cranking this?</v>

1100
00:48:34.551 --> 00:48:35.384
<v Speaker 1>Like what the fuck are they doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to show up at their house with </v>

1101
00:48:37.401 --> 00:48:40.250
<v Speaker 1>like some wine?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a bad example.</v>

1102
00:48:40.370 --> 00:48:42.320
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember what it was cause I </v>
<v Speaker 1>blocked it out.</v>

1103
00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:46.400
<v Speaker 1>Like childhood molestation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was so bad.</v>

1104
00:48:46.401 --> 00:48:48.230
<v Speaker 1>They were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were playing this fucking terrible,</v>

1105
00:48:48.231 --> 00:48:51.200
<v Speaker 1>but it was like this asshole was playing</v>
<v Speaker 1>it loud like he,</v>

1106
00:48:51.230 --> 00:48:53.570
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't even enjoy,</v>

1107
00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:56.360
<v Speaker 1>it was so loud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no way he was enjoying it.</v>

1108
00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:57.313
<v Speaker 1>He was enjoying showing off that he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>having a party with this shitty music </v>

1109
00:49:00.601 --> 00:49:02.750
<v Speaker 1>that him and his dying friends were </v>
<v Speaker 1>playing.</v>

1110
00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:04.273
<v Speaker 1>What do you listen to?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I listened to a lot of classic rock a </v>

<v Speaker 2>we're working with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was no Hendrickson music.</v>

1176
00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:06.550
<v Speaker 2>How could they should scrap the project </v>
<v Speaker 2>or paid up,</v>

1177
00:52:06.551 --> 00:52:09.460
<v Speaker 2>paid the family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to pay the family if you want to</v>

1178
00:52:09.461 --> 00:52:10.294
<v Speaker 2>make a fucking documentary or a bio pic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>About arguably the greatest guitarist </v>

1179
00:52:14.381 --> 00:52:17.190
<v Speaker 2>that's ever lived.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You gotta use this fucking music and got</v>

1180
00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:19.090
<v Speaker 2>to give his parents the money or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whoever,</v>

1181
00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:19.993
<v Speaker 2>whoever's alive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give him the money and if you gotta pay </v>

1182
00:52:21.371 --> 00:52:22.204
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the only way you're going to do </v>

1183
00:52:22.931 --> 00:52:23.381
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1184
00:52:23.381 --> 00:52:24.214
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise you're going to get a movie </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that where we don't talk about it </v>

1185
00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:28.190
<v Speaker 2>just goes in and out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1186
00:52:28.570 --> 00:52:29.403
<v Speaker 2>The guitar thing must drive you crazy </v>
<v Speaker 2>though when you know he's not really </v>

1187
00:52:31.391 --> 00:52:33.130
<v Speaker 2>playing that I couldn't handle it</v>

1188
00:52:35.690 --> 00:52:39.080
<v Speaker 5>cause me on a much lesser scale.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not a professional pool player,</v>

1189
00:52:39.380 --> 00:52:42.620
<v Speaker 5>but when I watched someone in a movie </v>
<v Speaker 5>and I know they can't really play pool,</v>

1190
00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:45.740
<v Speaker 5>it's very obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You see the way a guy's holding a stick,</v>

1191
00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:48.380
<v Speaker 5>the way the stick moves in their arm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

1192
00:52:48.530 --> 00:52:49.363
<v Speaker 5>have you ever seen someone hold a </v>
<v Speaker 5>cigarette that doesn't really smoke and </v>

1193
00:52:51.261 --> 00:52:52.094
<v Speaker 5>you could tell like a smoker can tell </v>
<v Speaker 5>like almost immediately when someone </v>

1194
00:52:55.071 --> 00:52:55.904
<v Speaker 5>doesn't actually smoke or at least </v>
<v Speaker 5>someone who is not aware of how people </v>

1195
00:53:00.510 --> 00:53:01.343
<v Speaker 5>smoke smoke.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure an actor can figure out how to </v>

1196
00:53:03.381 --> 00:53:04.214
<v Speaker 5>smoke like a smoker,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot easier than someone could figure </v>

1197
00:53:06.441 --> 00:53:09.440
<v Speaker 5>out how to play guitar and Mimic it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1198
00:53:09.590 --> 00:53:11.870
<v Speaker 5>Because when I see someone who can't </v>
<v Speaker 5>play pool and a movie and you're like,</v>

1199
00:53:12.410 --> 00:53:13.243
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pool hall junkies or something like </v>

1200
00:53:14.241 --> 00:53:15.074
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my shit get that fucking thing off to </v>

1201
00:53:15.771 --> 00:53:17.120
<v Speaker 5>tell.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It just drives me crazy.</v>

1202
00:53:17.260 --> 00:53:19.160
<v Speaker 5>I that guy can't play,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he can't play.</v>

1203
00:53:19.190 --> 00:53:20.540
<v Speaker 5>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's doing it all wrong.</v>

1204
00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:21.471
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's really good.</v>

1205
00:53:21.471 --> 00:53:22.910
<v Speaker 5>His bridge,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look at the way he's holding it.</v>

1206
00:53:22.911 --> 00:53:25.040
<v Speaker 5>This is bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's something real similar.</v>

1207
00:53:25.230 --> 00:53:26.130
<v Speaker 5>I mean he real simple</v>

1208
00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:26.963
<v Speaker 1>rather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just uh,</v>

1209
00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:29.820
<v Speaker 1>the movement of an arm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I could tell,</v>

1210
00:53:29.821 --> 00:53:34.320
<v Speaker 1>but for fingers and keys and the way a </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy's sounding,</v>

1211
00:53:34.350 --> 00:53:36.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they must be bananas to you.</v>

1212
00:53:37.430 --> 00:53:39.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I uh,</v>

1213
00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:40.350
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it drove me nuts.</v>

1214
00:53:40.860 --> 00:53:42.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what to say.</v>

1215
00:53:42.331 --> 00:53:43.350
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

1216
00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:45.510
<v Speaker 1>somebody picks it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah.</v>

1217
00:53:45.511 --> 00:53:48.060
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do they not have like a coordinator?</v>

1218
00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:49.890
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

1219
00:53:49.980 --> 00:53:52.080
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1220
00:53:52.260 --> 00:53:55.470
<v Speaker 1>unless your bullshit and unless it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a crazy Kung fu movie,</v>

1221
00:53:55.500 --> 00:53:56.333
<v Speaker 1>like obviously I have a connection to </v>
<v Speaker 1>martial arts where if I know someone's </v>

1222
00:53:59.011 --> 00:54:00.420
<v Speaker 1>doing something that's not really gonna </v>
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>

1223
00:54:00.450 --> 00:54:02.760
<v Speaker 1>it'll drive me crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if he's like,</v>

1224
00:54:02.761 --> 00:54:05.100
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like fucking pulling people's hearts out</v>

1225
00:54:05.101 --> 00:54:07.740
<v Speaker 1>and flying through the air and throwing </v>
<v Speaker 1>side kicks through buildings,</v>

1226
00:54:08.630 --> 00:54:12.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm willing to suspend disbelief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1227
00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:16.000
<v Speaker 1>But you can't do that for Jimi Hendrix </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a fucking biopic.</v>

1228
00:54:16.010 --> 00:54:17.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

1229
00:54:17.170 --> 00:54:18.003
<v Speaker 1>I've got a question for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of my favorite shows growing up was </v>

1230
00:54:23.070 --> 00:54:24.730
<v Speaker 1>Kung Fu with David carradine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1231
00:54:25.390 --> 00:54:26.460
<v Speaker 1>How did you feel about it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1232
00:54:26.461 --> 00:54:27.780
<v Speaker 1>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1233
00:54:27.810 --> 00:54:29.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I loved it.</v>

1234
00:54:29.390 --> 00:54:30.630
<v Speaker 1>It when I was a kid though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1235
00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:32.370
<v Speaker 1>But you watch it now and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

1236
00:54:33.330 --> 00:54:35.310
<v Speaker 1>But it was basically fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People didn't know how to fight.</v>

1237
00:54:35.900 --> 00:54:38.860
<v Speaker 1>Think there was no one he fought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like some dude came out and was a legit,</v>

1238
00:54:38.861 --> 00:54:40.770
<v Speaker 1>and Moy Thai fighters started kicking </v>
<v Speaker 1>his legs.</v>

1239
00:54:40.870 --> 00:54:44.040
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The carotene wrote out and killed him.</v>

1240
00:54:44.270 --> 00:54:46.020
<v Speaker 1>It was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Drunk guy with the beer mug.</v>

1241
00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:47.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1242
00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:50.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he really learned Kung Fu </v>
<v Speaker 1>for that show.</v>

1243
00:54:51.060 --> 00:54:53.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it didn't seem like he did.</v>

1244
00:54:53.880 --> 00:54:54.713
<v Speaker 1>It seemed like he had very little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that seemed like a real martial arts </v>

1245
00:54:58.561 --> 00:55:00.450
<v Speaker 1>move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1246
00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:02.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1247
00:55:02.630 --> 00:55:04.730
<v Speaker 1>I recently went back a couple of years </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>

1248
00:55:05.250 --> 00:55:07.790
<v Speaker 1>bought the series and watched the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing cause as a kid I loved it.</v>

1249
00:55:07.791 --> 00:55:08.624
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1250
00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:11.910
<v Speaker 1>my dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll put it on here you go son,</v>

1251
00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:12.930
<v Speaker 1>learn something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1252
00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:15.510
<v Speaker 1>lessons about how not to be an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1253
00:55:16.020 --> 00:55:18.840
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>

1254
00:55:18.841 --> 00:55:20.400
<v Speaker 1>but I watched it recently and I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>wearing,</v>

1255
00:55:20.401 --> 00:55:21.570
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are these guys?</v>

1256
00:55:21.790 --> 00:55:22.650
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1257
00:55:22.740 --> 00:55:25.110
<v Speaker 1>cause he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really know what's up.</v>

1258
00:55:25.111 --> 00:55:26.700
<v Speaker 1>How do you feel about this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I don't know.</v>

1259
00:55:26.790 --> 00:55:28.140
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1260
00:55:28.700 --> 00:55:32.210
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one respects it.</v>

1261
00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:34.153
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1262
00:55:36.630 --> 00:55:39.780
<v Speaker 1>But it was a good show in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting,</v>

1263
00:55:40.050 --> 00:55:42.030
<v Speaker 1>like if you take out the martial arts </v>
<v Speaker 1>element of it,</v>

1264
00:55:42.060 --> 00:55:46.360
<v Speaker 1>it's an interesting show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got this guy who was raised in a,</v>

1265
00:55:46.650 --> 00:55:50.610
<v Speaker 1>like a monastery and then he's wandering</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the old west.</v>

1266
00:55:50.700 --> 00:55:51.533
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a cool premise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The premise behind it is really </v>

1267
00:55:53.551 --> 00:55:54.750
<v Speaker 1>interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1268
00:55:54.751 --> 00:55:55.584
<v Speaker 1>And he was like this real calm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>peaceful guy who wasn't an asshole at </v>

1269
00:56:00.001 --> 00:56:01.860
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could not have been nicer.</v>

1270
00:56:02.310 --> 00:56:03.143
<v Speaker 1>And that was a unique character because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's really never been anybody on </v>

1271
00:56:05.371 --> 00:56:06.570
<v Speaker 1>television.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like that.</v>

1272
00:56:06.571 --> 00:56:09.300
<v Speaker 1>Just like there's an enlightened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>peaceful guy,</v>

1273
00:56:09.620 --> 00:56:11.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had long hair and shit.</v>

1274
00:56:11.230 --> 00:56:12.063
<v Speaker 1>He's just kind of a hippie and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>wandering through life and people keep </v>

1275
00:56:13.891 --> 00:56:15.570
<v Speaker 1>fucking with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep fucking with them.</v>

1276
00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:16.800
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1277
00:56:17.310 --> 00:56:18.143
<v Speaker 1>it was interesting in that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it made a lot of people want to </v>

1278
00:56:21.511 --> 00:56:23.610
<v Speaker 1>pretend they're that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>

1279
00:56:25.030 --> 00:56:28.110
<v Speaker 3>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1280
00:56:28.570 --> 00:56:30.970
<v Speaker 3>Like house out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How so?</v>

1281
00:56:31.060 --> 00:56:31.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How are you one of them?</v>

1282
00:56:32.630 --> 00:56:33.463
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1283
00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:36.050
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the attitude,</v>

1284
00:56:36.051 --> 00:56:38.000
<v Speaker 2>just the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1285
00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:40.070
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

1286
00:56:40.340 --> 00:56:42.500
<v Speaker 2>I was waiting for a moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1287
00:56:42.560 --> 00:56:44.690
<v Speaker 2>I wish somebody would so I could quite </v>
<v Speaker 2>Chang Caine.</v>

1288
00:56:46.850 --> 00:56:49.880
<v Speaker 3>That's the opposite though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wished somebody would be peaceful.</v>

1289
00:56:52.450 --> 00:56:54.310
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was a kid so I can all right.</v>

1290
00:56:54.340 --> 00:56:54.650
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1291
00:56:54.650 --> 00:56:55.730
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that.</v>

1292
00:56:56.430 --> 00:56:58.680
<v Speaker 2>Speaking of being an inspired man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1293
00:56:58.910 --> 00:57:00.740
<v Speaker 2>one of my favorite things that I love to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>

1294
00:57:00.741 --> 00:57:02.200
<v Speaker 2>which I haven't done in awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

1295
00:57:02.510 --> 00:57:04.010
<v Speaker 2>it was um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1296
00:57:04.670 --> 00:57:08.120
<v Speaker 2>catch up and watch the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1297
00:57:08.180 --> 00:57:10.030
<v Speaker 2>and get into that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1298
00:57:10.370 --> 00:57:14.570
<v Speaker 2>I was sitting around and starting to </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of feel like a piece of shit,</v>

1299
00:57:14.600 --> 00:57:17.480
<v Speaker 2>drinking too much and whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it was,</v>

1300
00:57:17.560 --> 00:57:18.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at these guys,</v>

1301
00:57:19.130 --> 00:57:21.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>training and doing what they do.</v>

1302
00:57:21.291 --> 00:57:22.124
<v Speaker 2>So I kinda inspired me to get on my bike</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he'd get the heavy bag and get on </v>

1303
00:57:25.311 --> 00:57:28.630
<v Speaker 2>the weights and do my thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1304
00:57:28.830 --> 00:57:29.663
<v Speaker 2>it was really into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't been been keeping up for </v>

1305
00:57:32.601 --> 00:57:36.090
<v Speaker 2>awhile and kind of got the guts to show </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and I'm working on them.</v>

1306
00:57:36.140 --> 00:57:38.180
<v Speaker 2>I need to get back on my game is what </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying.</v>

1307
00:57:38.770 --> 00:57:40.180
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to train while you were in </v>
<v Speaker 1>la?</v>

1308
00:57:40.210 --> 00:57:42.510
<v Speaker 1>Is that what you're saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would love to find you need to,</v>

1309
00:57:42.520 --> 00:57:45.110
<v Speaker 1>I need to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we'll talk off the air and uh,</v>

1310
00:57:45.111 --> 00:57:45.944
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll get you to know like are you </v>

1311
00:57:46.511 --> 00:57:49.030
<v Speaker 1>interested in taking Jujitsu or what are</v>
<v Speaker 1>you interested in doing?</v>

1312
00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:52.060
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it was was kind of right for,</v>

1313
00:57:52.260 --> 00:57:53.093
<v Speaker 2>for me and my build and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I don't have a whole lot of time </v>

1314
00:57:56.321 --> 00:57:57.154
<v Speaker 2>but I'm definitely interested in and </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting back into it and get my mind </v>

1315
00:57:59.531 --> 00:58:00.110
<v Speaker 2>focused.</v>

1316
00:58:00.110 --> 00:58:00.943
<v Speaker 1>The real reality is there's different </v>
<v Speaker 1>styles of Jujitsu that are great for </v>

1317
00:58:03.861 --> 00:58:06.230
<v Speaker 1>every build.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I say different styles,</v>

1318
00:58:06.231 --> 00:58:09.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean different approaches to Jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 1>is so broad.</v>

1319
00:58:10.100 --> 00:58:12.830
<v Speaker 1>There's so many different techniques and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so many different strategies and</v>

1320
00:58:12.831 --> 00:58:17.570
<v Speaker 1>so many different moves and countermoves</v>
<v Speaker 1>that your build is perfect for Jujitsu.</v>

1321
00:58:17.870 --> 00:58:20.690
<v Speaker 1>You along and tall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have long arms and long legs and you</v>

1322
00:58:20.691 --> 00:58:21.524
<v Speaker 1>can catch people in chokes that a stubby</v>
<v Speaker 1>little dude like me can't cause I have </v>

1323
00:58:25.041 --> 00:58:26.570
<v Speaker 1>short arms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>short legs,</v>

1324
00:58:26.690 --> 00:58:27.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's different,</v>

1325
00:58:27.951 --> 00:58:32.170
<v Speaker 1>but different builds like mine are </v>
<v Speaker 1>better for certain positions like this,</v>

1326
00:58:32.171 --> 00:58:35.900
<v Speaker 1>this guy who some are Paul Harris who's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like me but more exaggerated.</v>

1327
00:58:35.901 --> 00:58:39.080
<v Speaker 1>He's way thicker and more muscular and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he just tears people's legs apart.</v>

1328
00:58:39.500 --> 00:58:40.333
<v Speaker 1>He's a leg lock specialist and there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of other guys that are smaller that </v>

1329
00:58:43.700 --> 00:58:44.533
<v Speaker 1>is like really fast and they're good at </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking people's backs like Marcella </v>

1330
00:58:47.480 --> 00:58:47.900
<v Speaker 1>Garcia.</v>

1331
00:58:47.900 --> 00:58:51.310
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of tall guys and Jujitsu.</v>

1332
00:58:51.380 --> 00:58:53.150
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely an advantage.</v>

1333
00:58:53.510 --> 00:58:54.343
<v Speaker 1>It's an advantage of leverage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like just mechanical leverage from </v>

1334
00:58:56.691 --> 00:58:59.810
<v Speaker 1>having long limbs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good for striking to them,</v>

1335
00:58:59.811 --> 00:59:01.310
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good for learning,</v>

1336
00:59:01.311 --> 00:59:03.080
<v Speaker 1>not striking arts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if I,</v>

1337
00:59:03.081 --> 00:59:03.914
<v Speaker 1>if I had to say like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's one bill that has like the </v>

1338
00:59:06.051 --> 00:59:06.884
<v Speaker 1>most definitive advantages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say tall and long because it's </v>

1339
00:59:09.561 --> 00:59:11.570
<v Speaker 1>harder to hit you because you're further</v>
<v Speaker 1>away from me.</v>

1340
00:59:11.740 --> 00:59:12.573
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get hit me in a place where I can </v>

1341
00:59:13.401 --> 00:59:14.720
<v Speaker 1>hit you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how tall are you?</v>

1342
00:59:14.900 --> 00:59:15.690
<v Speaker 1>Six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>

1343
00:59:15.690 --> 00:59:16.161
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four.</v>

1344
00:59:16.161 --> 00:59:16.994
<v Speaker 1>I'm five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eight.</v>

1345
00:59:17.210 --> 00:59:20.630
<v Speaker 1>So you're dealing with all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're dealing with eight extra inches.</v>

1346
00:59:20.750 --> 00:59:23.550
<v Speaker 1>So eight extra inches between,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1347
00:59:23.551 --> 00:59:27.290
<v Speaker 1>your head in my head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which may or may not translate as far as</v>

1348
00:59:27.291 --> 00:59:27.890
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1349
00:59:27.890 --> 00:59:30.470
<v Speaker 1>how long your arms are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how long your legs are.</v>

1350
00:59:31.100 --> 00:59:34.520
<v Speaker 1>But definitely there's a at least a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>inches of advantage,</v>

1351
00:59:34.880 --> 00:59:37.820
<v Speaker 1>which means like if we're both throwing </v>
<v Speaker 1>punches at the same time,</v>

1352
00:59:37.821 --> 00:59:38.654
<v Speaker 1>you had hit me before I would hit you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I probably would never hit you </v>

1353
00:59:40.671 --> 00:59:41.504
<v Speaker 1>because of that because he would hit me </v>
<v Speaker 1>like as I was throwing up punch and I'd </v>

1354
00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:46.730
<v Speaker 1>get fucked up like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a big advantage.</v>

1355
00:59:46.731 --> 00:59:48.320
<v Speaker 1>Like John Jones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the UFC,</v>

1356
00:59:48.340 --> 00:59:49.173
<v Speaker 1>a former light heavyweight champion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like the best at you cause he's a </v>

1357
00:59:51.321 --> 00:59:54.470
<v Speaker 1>big tall dude and he's the best at like </v>
<v Speaker 1>using that advantage.</v>

1358
00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:56.690
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the best advantages of being</v>
<v Speaker 1>long and tall.</v>

1359
00:59:56.930 --> 00:59:58.110
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1360
00:59:58.130 --> 00:59:59.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm ready.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Ready?</v>

1361
00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:01.570
<v Speaker 1>I need to do checking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>moving your jacket.</v>

1362
01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:04.760
<v Speaker 1>I was like balling up my fists way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're talking to like,</v>

1363
01:00:04.770 --> 01:00:05.603
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do this.</v>

1364
01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:08.750
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a great way to blow off </v>
<v Speaker 1>energy and stress.</v>

1365
01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:12.080
<v Speaker 1>I need that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Definitely people get addicted to it.</v>

1366
01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:12.913
<v Speaker 1>Like we was talking about bordain um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't even start doing it until he </v>

1367
01:00:14.991 --> 01:00:19.100
<v Speaker 1>was 58 and 57 58 and now he does it </v>
<v Speaker 1>every day.</v>

1368
01:00:19.130 --> 01:00:21.200
<v Speaker 1>He does Jiu Jitsu every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He loves it.</v>

1369
01:00:21.201 --> 01:00:22.460
<v Speaker 1>He's obsessed with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1370
01:00:22.910 --> 01:00:25.000
<v Speaker 1>A lot of musicians get into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1371
01:00:25.050 --> 01:00:27.690
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of musicians that are in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jiu Jitsu,</v>

1372
01:00:28.010 --> 01:00:28.843
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it becomes like a martial arts </v>

1373
01:00:30.741 --> 01:00:31.574
<v Speaker 1>really are an art form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem an art form to the </v>

1374
01:00:33.861 --> 01:00:35.540
<v Speaker 1>outsider because people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say,</v>

1375
01:00:35.570 --> 01:00:36.560
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just fighting.</v>

1376
01:00:36.561 --> 01:00:40.070
<v Speaker 1>It's just brutality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the reality is there's way,</v>

1377
01:00:40.071 --> 01:00:40.904
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way more people who are into martial </v>

1378
01:00:42.141 --> 01:00:44.600
<v Speaker 1>arts who never get into a fight ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>

1379
01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:48.470
<v Speaker 1>then people who use it either in </v>
<v Speaker 1>competition or use it for self defense.</v>

1380
01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:50.180
<v Speaker 1>It's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1381
01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:53.390
<v Speaker 1>it's a form of art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an expression.</v>

1382
01:00:53.391 --> 01:00:55.490
<v Speaker 1>And you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you watch someone pull off a move,</v>

1383
01:00:55.790 --> 01:00:56.660
<v Speaker 1>it's beautiful.</v>

1384
01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:57.553
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those things that seems to </v>

1385
01:00:58.491 --> 01:01:00.740
<v Speaker 1>be only beautiful for people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand it,</v>

1386
01:01:01.100 --> 01:01:02.900
<v Speaker 1>but for people to understand that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>

1387
01:01:03.020 --> 01:01:03.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1388
01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:04.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can respect it.</v>

1389
01:01:04.851 --> 01:01:07.280
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of understand what's going on.</v>

1390
01:01:07.281 --> 01:01:08.360
<v Speaker 1>I can appreciate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1391
01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:12.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone playing a nice solo or something</v>

1392
01:01:12.351 --> 01:01:16.100
<v Speaker 1>and executing it well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can kind of get that,</v>

1393
01:01:16.130 --> 01:01:16.963
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1394
01:01:17.330 --> 01:01:18.163
<v Speaker 1>the art,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the what it takes to pay attention to </v>

1395
01:01:20.770 --> 01:01:23.480
<v Speaker 1>and be in that moment and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

1396
01:01:24.260 --> 01:01:25.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>execute.</v>

1397
01:01:25.970 --> 01:01:27.230
<v Speaker 1>It's a bunch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that,</v>

1398
01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:28.093
<v Speaker 1>it's a bunch of other factors too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's setting up an attack that either </v>

1399
01:01:32.151 --> 01:01:32.984
<v Speaker 1>the person couldn't anticipate or </v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't figure out what to do in time </v>

1400
01:01:36.620 --> 01:01:39.500
<v Speaker 1>and then it locks in and then once it </v>
<v Speaker 1>locks in and be like,</v>

1401
01:01:39.530 --> 01:01:41.150
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>

1402
01:01:41.151 --> 01:01:43.850
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a painting or a work of art or</v>

1403
01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:46.940
<v Speaker 1>masterful guitar solo or any of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1404
01:01:47.350 --> 01:01:48.183
<v Speaker 1>Art Is your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your dedication and your focus and then </v>

1405
01:01:51.621 --> 01:01:56.180
<v Speaker 1>the expression and the results of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>dedication and focus in a way where like</v>

1406
01:01:56.181 --> 01:01:58.580
<v Speaker 1>if I'll watch someone pull off a move </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I don't know how to do,</v>

1407
01:01:58.581 --> 01:02:01.190
<v Speaker 1>it's particularly beautiful to me </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm like,</v>

1408
01:02:01.220 --> 01:02:02.053
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look what he did that like there's </v>

1409
01:02:03.561 --> 01:02:07.070
<v Speaker 1>certain moves that I'll have to replay </v>
<v Speaker 1>like over and over and over again.</v>

1410
01:02:07.071 --> 01:02:07.904
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll watch certain setups like over and </v>

1411
01:02:10.401 --> 01:02:12.430
<v Speaker 1>over and over again until I get it into </v>
<v Speaker 1>my head and,</v>

1412
01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:13.573
<v Speaker 1>and I didn't this so many different ways</v>
<v Speaker 1>to move the body that there's a lot of </v>

1413
01:02:17.601 --> 01:02:20.010
<v Speaker 1>like I've been doing Jujitsu since 1996</v>

1414
01:02:20.250 --> 01:02:22.800
<v Speaker 5>and there's still a bunch of moves that </v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

1415
01:02:23.190 --> 01:02:24.840
<v Speaker 5>I don't understand and I have to go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1416
01:02:24.841 --> 01:02:26.130
<v Speaker 5>how did he do that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How did he do that?</v>

1417
01:02:26.310 --> 01:02:27.143
<v Speaker 5>But today,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like we're talking about like with </v>

1418
01:02:28.591 --> 01:02:29.424
<v Speaker 5>Google,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're so lucky that we could just go to </v>

1419
01:02:31.741 --> 01:02:32.574
<v Speaker 5>youtube videos.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And one of the beautiful things about </v>

1420
01:02:35.101 --> 01:02:38.850
<v Speaker 5>Jujitsu is it used to be that martial </v>
<v Speaker 5>arts where like a secret,</v>

1421
01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:39.833
<v Speaker 5>this is the secret death touch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And nobody would tell you that secret </v>

1422
01:02:42.361 --> 01:02:43.200
<v Speaker 5>death touch,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1423
01:02:43.201 --> 01:02:44.790
<v Speaker 5>It didn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was bullshit.</v>

1424
01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:46.193
<v Speaker 5>The reality of Jujitsu is almost every </v>
<v Speaker 5>move people are dying to explain to </v>

1425
01:02:51.031 --> 01:02:53.070
<v Speaker 5>people because people love learning new </v>
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>

1426
01:02:53.430 --> 01:02:56.070
<v Speaker 5>People that are Jujitsu artists love </v>
<v Speaker 5>learning new stuff.</v>

1427
01:02:56.220 --> 01:02:58.500
<v Speaker 5>So people that are Jujutsu artists that </v>
<v Speaker 5>have a new move,</v>

1428
01:02:58.501 --> 01:03:01.860
<v Speaker 5>love to put that move online.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a big part of the community.</v>

1429
01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:04.410
<v Speaker 5>A huge part of the community is sharing </v>
<v Speaker 5>and openness.</v>

1430
01:03:05.010 --> 01:03:08.010
<v Speaker 5>So like everybody does seminars and </v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody teaches everybody everything.</v>

1431
01:03:08.310 --> 01:03:10.650
<v Speaker 5>But in the early days it wasn't like </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

1432
01:03:10.651 --> 01:03:11.484
<v Speaker 5>Even the early days of Jujitsu when what</v>
<v Speaker 5>happened was in 1993 when the UFC was </v>

1433
01:03:16.171 --> 01:03:17.004
<v Speaker 5>created,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people first started to see Jujitsu and </v>

1434
01:03:18.691 --> 01:03:19.980
<v Speaker 5>they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck?</v>

1435
01:03:19.981 --> 01:03:20.814
<v Speaker 5>But there was a lot of moves like </v>
<v Speaker 5>triangles or things like along those </v>

1436
01:03:22.831 --> 01:03:27.270
<v Speaker 5>lines where I had friends that would </v>
<v Speaker 5>take classes at certain schools and they</v>

1437
01:03:27.271 --> 01:03:27.991
<v Speaker 5>would say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

1438
01:03:27.991 --> 01:03:28.824
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hoists gracie tapped out Dan Saffron </v>

1439
01:03:30.301 --> 01:03:31.710
<v Speaker 5>with a triangle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how do I do that?</v>

1440
01:03:31.950 --> 01:03:33.570
<v Speaker 5>And the teacher like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're not ready for that yet.</v>

1441
01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:36.170
<v Speaker 5>Like I can't teach you that yet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's,</v>

1442
01:03:36.220 --> 01:03:39.030
<v Speaker 5>that's a black belt technique or that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>a purple belt technique or whatever.</v>

1443
01:03:39.060 --> 01:03:41.040
<v Speaker 5>And they just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and people are turned off to it.</v>

1444
01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:42.113
<v Speaker 5>And then they found other more </v>
<v Speaker 5>unconventional openminded schools that </v>

1445
01:03:45.750 --> 01:03:46.583
<v Speaker 5>immediately taught everybody everything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And those are the schools that became </v>

1446
01:03:49.171 --> 01:03:50.004
<v Speaker 5>prosperous.</v>

1447
01:03:50.110 --> 01:03:53.790
<v Speaker 5>Those schools were really successful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the schools that held people back,</v>

1448
01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:54.653
<v Speaker 5>they never produce champions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they never produced any like real </v>

1449
01:03:56.791 --> 01:03:57.624
<v Speaker 5>notable Jujitsu players.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the open minded like experimental </v>

1450
01:04:00.841 --> 01:04:02.850
<v Speaker 5>schools,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those are the ones that blew up.</v>

1451
01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:03.953
<v Speaker 5>It's really interesting in that way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the free exchange of information </v>

1452
01:04:07.410 --> 01:04:10.470
<v Speaker 5>overwhelmingly won out in the world of </v>
<v Speaker 5>Jujitsu.</v>

1453
01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:13.200
<v Speaker 5>That makes sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It does,</v>

1454
01:04:13.201 --> 01:04:14.034
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1455
01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:15.870
<v Speaker 5>So how does it like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1456
01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:18.833
<v Speaker 5>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have a same kind of appreciation for </v>

1457
01:04:22.650 --> 01:04:24.660
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the art,</v>

1458
01:04:24.661 --> 01:04:26.190
<v Speaker 5>martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 5>comedy,</v>

1459
01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:28.140
<v Speaker 5>music,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1460
01:04:29.130 --> 01:04:30.060
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>anything like that.</v>

1461
01:04:30.061 --> 01:04:30.894
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can appreciate the hard work and </v>

1462
01:04:32.101 --> 01:04:32.934
<v Speaker 5>everything that goes back into,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so you feel the same way about martial </v>

1463
01:04:34.951 --> 01:04:38.520
<v Speaker 5>arts is like comedy or do you approach </v>
<v Speaker 5>it the same way or?</v>

1464
01:04:38.910 --> 01:04:40.410
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1465
01:04:40.630 --> 01:04:42.090
<v Speaker 5>in some ways,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1466
01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:44.640
<v Speaker 5>in some ways it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's about practice,</v>

1467
01:04:44.670 --> 01:04:47.430
<v Speaker 5>dedication,</v>
<v Speaker 5>application and reality.</v>

1468
01:04:47.580 --> 01:04:50.070
<v Speaker 5>Like if something's not funny,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just not funny.</v>

1469
01:04:50.070 --> 01:04:51.660
<v Speaker 5>If people don't laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they just don't laugh.</v>

1470
01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:54.240
<v Speaker 5>And if a technique doesn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it just doesn't work.</v>

1471
01:04:54.510 --> 01:04:55.680
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you can't pull it off,</v>

1472
01:04:55.681 --> 01:04:57.440
<v Speaker 5>if somebody chokes you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they just choked you.</v>

1473
01:04:57.950 --> 01:05:01.260
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could be a 20 year black belt,</v>

1474
01:05:01.261 --> 01:05:02.094
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And some dude catches you in a </v>

1475
01:05:03.101 --> 01:05:03.934
<v Speaker 5>guillotine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's only been doing Jujitsu for six </v>

1476
01:05:04.831 --> 01:05:07.650
<v Speaker 5>months,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but someone teaches him how to do this.</v>

1477
01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:09.260
<v Speaker 5>Grab your arm like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Polar,</v>

1478
01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:12.060
<v Speaker 5>any someone's neck,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wrap your legs around him at squeeze and</v>

1479
01:05:12.061 --> 01:05:13.080
<v Speaker 5>you can't get out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1480
01:05:13.081 --> 01:05:15.870
<v Speaker 5>he tapped you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even if he's only been doing Jujitsu for</v>

1481
01:05:15.871 --> 01:05:18.760
<v Speaker 5>six months and you've been doing Jujitsu</v>
<v Speaker 5>for 30 years,</v>

1482
01:05:19.150 --> 01:05:22.060
<v Speaker 5>it's stays.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's still real for guy taps you,</v>

1483
01:05:22.061 --> 01:05:23.980
<v Speaker 5>they tap you just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's no,</v>

1484
01:05:24.010 --> 01:05:24.843
<v Speaker 5>if it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's one of the things I love about </v>

1485
01:05:25.721 --> 01:05:26.554
<v Speaker 5>pool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The ball either goes in the hole or it </v>

1486
01:05:28.061 --> 01:05:28.930
<v Speaker 5>doesn't go in the hole.</v>

1487
01:05:29.620 --> 01:05:31.900
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't matter if either knock it in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the hole or you don't.</v>

1488
01:05:31.901 --> 01:05:34.990
<v Speaker 5>There's no almost made that shot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That doesn't mean Jack Shit,</v>

1489
01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:37.030
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't mean anything.</v>

1490
01:05:37.660 --> 01:05:40.260
<v Speaker 5>I'm that asshole who says that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1491
01:05:40.270 --> 01:05:41.103
<v Speaker 5>we all say it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you know the reality of the actual </v>

1492
01:05:43.451 --> 01:05:44.780
<v Speaker 5>winning of the game,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1493
01:05:45.390 --> 01:05:47.140
<v Speaker 5>It's a personality thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1494
01:05:47.141 --> 01:05:47.974
<v Speaker 5>sometimes people can get really far on a</v>
<v Speaker 5>bullshit personality and a lot of </v>

1495
01:05:51.281 --> 01:05:55.440
<v Speaker 5>bravado and a lot of bragging and a lot </v>
<v Speaker 5>of false stories and,</v>

1496
01:05:55.441 --> 01:05:58.870
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then the actual application life is,</v>

1497
01:05:58.871 --> 01:06:02.650
<v Speaker 5>they've sort of skirted through with all</v>
<v Speaker 5>the dance moves and all the personality,</v>

1498
01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:04.360
<v Speaker 5>but they don't have any real substance </v>
<v Speaker 5>to it.</v>

1499
01:06:04.630 --> 01:06:06.610
<v Speaker 5>That doesn't work in Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just like,</v>

1500
01:06:06.611 --> 01:06:08.980
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't really work in comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>comedy,</v>

1501
01:06:08.981 --> 01:06:12.820
<v Speaker 5>like personality accounts for certain </v>
<v Speaker 5>amount of the audience accepting you.</v>

1502
01:06:12.821 --> 01:06:13.654
<v Speaker 5>But ultimately if the concepts aren't </v>
<v Speaker 5>there and if you don't have like a good </v>

1503
01:06:18.011 --> 01:06:19.810
<v Speaker 5>setup,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you don't know how to deliver it in a</v>

1504
01:06:19.811 --> 01:06:20.644
<v Speaker 5>way that people are gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like it's going to easily enter into </v>

1505
01:06:23.201 --> 01:06:25.390
<v Speaker 5>their mind and they're going to like </v>
<v Speaker 5>carry along,</v>

1506
01:06:25.420 --> 01:06:28.660
<v Speaker 5>then it either works or it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And there's,</v>

1507
01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:29.553
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's some parallel truths in that in </v>

1508
01:06:32.231 --> 01:06:34.420
<v Speaker 5>martial arts and in comedy in that way.</v>

1509
01:06:36.690 --> 01:06:37.960
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1510
01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:39.490
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

1511
01:06:39.490 --> 01:06:41.110
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm very intrigued by all of it,</v>

1512
01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:46.200
<v Speaker 5>so that's why I'm asking some very </v>
<v Speaker 5>curious.</v>

1513
01:06:47.231 --> 01:06:49.030
<v Speaker 5>I want to get in there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1514
01:06:49.031 --> 01:06:52.960
<v Speaker 5>all complex systems,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether it's music or writing,</v>

1515
01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:54.033
<v Speaker 5>I'm creating a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anything complex things are fascinating </v>

1516
01:06:56.381 --> 01:06:59.830
<v Speaker 5>to me too cause I just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've never made a movie,</v>

1517
01:07:00.070 --> 01:07:03.280
<v Speaker 5>but I want to see like CGI animators.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I go watch this.</v>

1518
01:07:03.281 --> 01:07:04.870
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this um,</v>

1519
01:07:04.900 --> 01:07:05.733
<v Speaker 5>documentary on a guy's making a animated</v>
<v Speaker 5>scenes for films like special effects </v>

1520
01:07:10.811 --> 01:07:12.730
<v Speaker 5>scenes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think to myself,</v>

1521
01:07:12.731 --> 01:07:13.564
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that is fascinating that they're </v>

1522
01:07:13.841 --> 01:07:17.050
<v Speaker 5>creating an artificial world and inside </v>
<v Speaker 5>that artificial world,</v>

1523
01:07:17.051 --> 01:07:17.884
<v Speaker 5>they have these creatures moving and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they have these people they'd have to </v>

1524
01:07:19.781 --> 01:07:22.810
<v Speaker 5>put on these motion capture suits and go</v>
<v Speaker 5>through the motions,</v>

1525
01:07:22.811 --> 01:07:25.630
<v Speaker 5>pretending they're interacting with </v>
<v Speaker 5>these things that aren't even there.</v>

1526
01:07:25.810 --> 01:07:27.940
<v Speaker 5>And then someone has to peace.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing to me.</v>

1527
01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.580
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing to me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm not going to do it.</v>

1528
01:07:30.910 --> 01:07:31.840
<v Speaker 5>I don't have any time.</v>

1529
01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:34.833
<v Speaker 5>But I look at that the same way I kind </v>
<v Speaker 5>of look at music or the same way I look </v>

1530
01:07:37.931 --> 01:07:38.764
<v Speaker 5>at writing or comedy or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's fascinating to me watching </v>

1531
01:07:42.161 --> 01:07:42.994
<v Speaker 5>someone go after something and put it </v>
<v Speaker 5>together and make something that is </v>

1532
01:07:47.651 --> 01:07:51.580
<v Speaker 5>almost unfathomable take place.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whether it's a creation of an album,</v>

1533
01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:52.900
<v Speaker 5>whether it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1534
01:07:52.901 --> 01:07:53.734
<v Speaker 5>a comedy special,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether it's someone writes an amazing </v>

1535
01:07:55.871 --> 01:07:58.630
<v Speaker 5>book.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love when people get shit done.</v>

1536
01:08:00.070 --> 01:08:01.630
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do too.</v>

1537
01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:03.880
<v Speaker 5>It's a beautiful thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1538
01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:05.193
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1539
01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:06.940
<v Speaker 5>Well as artists,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1540
01:08:06.941 --> 01:08:07.690
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>does that,</v>

1541
01:08:07.690 --> 01:08:09.320
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as as an artist,</v>

1542
01:08:09.321 --> 01:08:10.154
<v Speaker 5>does that inspire you when you see,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like if you go to see a great movie or </v>

1543
01:08:12.850 --> 01:08:14.230
<v Speaker 5>read a great book or something like </v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

1544
01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:15.980
<v Speaker 5>does that inspire you to want to</v>

1545
01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:16.813
<v Speaker 1>create?</v>

1546
01:08:18.350 --> 01:08:19.183
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't inspire me to create a write </v>

01:08:21.831 --> 01:08:22.400
<v Speaker 2>a book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

1586
01:09:56.141 --> 01:09:59.500
<v Speaker 2>Played backed up muddy waters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1587
01:10:00.130 --> 01:10:02.800
<v Speaker 2>Albert Collins,</v>

1590
01:10:09.190 --> 01:10:13.000
<v Speaker 2>And so I go back home and I got my </v>
<v Speaker 2>little reputation and you know,</v>

1591
01:10:13.030 --> 01:10:13.870
<v Speaker 2>people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1594
01:10:17.741 --> 01:10:20.290
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know my strengths and weaknesses,</v>

1595
01:10:20.340 --> 01:10:25.340
<v Speaker 2>but I was feeling good about myself and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then I got up on stage and let this,</v>

1596
01:10:25.690 --> 01:10:28.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy was just ripping it and I just,</v>

1597
01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:29.740
<v Speaker 2>in that moment I was like,</v>

1598
01:10:33.470 --> 01:10:36.620
<v Speaker 1>I ain't got shit on this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what that's like.</v>

1599
01:10:36.860 --> 01:10:38.630

<v Speaker 1>it was a nice reality check.</v>

1600
01:10:38.631 --> 01:10:39.464
<v Speaker 1>So I immediately went back and started </v>
<v Speaker 1>shedding and I've been kind of doing it </v>

<v Speaker 1>around inspiring artists.</v>

1603
01:10:47.761 --> 01:10:52.760
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the cool things about being </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a place like an la or Nashville or if</v>

1604
01:10:52.761 --> 01:10:54.620

1606
01:10:59.181 --> 01:11:02.540
<v Speaker 1>also doing the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you use those people and they use you</v>

1607
01:11:02.541 --> 01:11:04.220
<v Speaker 1>and everybody's like fuel for each </v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>try out some new chords.</v>

1632
01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:17.120
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you learned something fancy that </v>
<v Speaker 2>could,</v>

1633
01:12:17.490 --> 01:12:18.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>transition chord,</v>

1634
01:12:19.340 --> 01:12:20.173
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go from the one to five on a </v>

1635
01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:25.400
<v Speaker 2>turnaround in this little blue is </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

1636
01:12:25.401 --> 01:12:26.840
<v Speaker 2>and the key to see whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1637
01:12:26.841 --> 01:12:30.800
<v Speaker 2>So you'd go work that out and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you bring your squad.</v>

1638
01:12:30.830 --> 01:12:31.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>me and my buddies,</v>

1639
01:12:31.671 --> 01:12:36.671
<v Speaker 2>a potter when he plays in my band,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we would go up sometimes and no,</v>

1640
01:12:38.390 --> 01:12:39.223
<v Speaker 2>a drummer that kind of knew how we </v>
<v Speaker 2>floated and the Bass player who could </v>

1641
01:12:41.601 --> 01:12:43.520
<v Speaker 2>pick up on something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we got this new track,</v>

1642
01:12:43.521 --> 01:12:44.510
<v Speaker 2>we're about to fuck people up.</v>

1643
01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:47.310
<v Speaker 5>This either would work or it wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But yeah,</v>

1644
01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:48.840
<v Speaker 2>those places.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1645
01:12:50.370 --> 01:12:51.630
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the kind of the fuel,</v>

1646
01:12:51.930 --> 01:12:54.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be in those spots and be around other</v>

1647
01:12:54.810 --> 01:12:57.270
<v Speaker 2>players and get up and do that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1648
01:12:58.740 --> 01:12:59.573
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1649
01:13:00.590 --> 01:13:02.610
<v Speaker 2>it was nothing like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1650
01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:05.580
<v Speaker 5>So for you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you create music,</v>

1651
01:13:06.060 --> 01:13:07.170
<v Speaker 5>is it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1652
01:13:07.470 --> 01:13:09.670
<v Speaker 5>like do you just get an idea,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like how did,</v>

1653
01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:12.030
<v Speaker 5>what does the creation process from,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is it,</v>

1654
01:13:12.031 --> 01:13:15.720
<v Speaker 5>does it vary or is there a specific </v>
<v Speaker 5>creation process from the moment you get</v>

1655
01:13:15.721 --> 01:13:16.554
<v Speaker 5>an idea to putting it to paper or to </v>
<v Speaker 5>remembering it and making a song and </v>

1656
01:13:22.050 --> 01:13:24.480
<v Speaker 5>putting the beat to it and pin it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>putting the sounds to it?</v>

1657
01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:27.720
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of an unorganized mess.</v>

1658
01:13:27.810 --> 01:13:31.080
<v Speaker 2>I said I haven't figured out a process </v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

1659
01:13:32.610 --> 01:13:35.040
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's a mess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it just comes naturally.</v>

1660
01:13:35.100 --> 01:13:40.100
<v Speaker 2>Like I'll have a guitar and I might,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1661
01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:45.090
<v Speaker 2>have a chord progression and it'll just </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of stick and then I'll put a melody</v>

1662
01:13:45.091 --> 01:13:45.924
<v Speaker 2>over it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be singing something around the </v>

1663
01:13:46.981 --> 01:13:50.760
<v Speaker 2>house and grabbed the guitar and put </v>
<v Speaker 2>that together.</v>

1664
01:13:50.761 --> 01:13:53.220
<v Speaker 2>Or um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1665
01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:54.113
<v Speaker 2>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love being able to travel and you </v>

1666
01:13:56.411 --> 01:13:57.151
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I travel a lot,</v>

1667
01:13:57.151 --> 01:14:02.151
<v Speaker 2>so on airplane or on the bus I'll pull </v>
<v Speaker 2>out the NPC or something and kind of put</v>

1668
01:14:02.881 --> 01:14:05.310
<v Speaker 2>in drum tracks and build from there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1669
01:14:05.311 --> 01:14:08.700
<v Speaker 2>So it all just kind of depends on where </v>
<v Speaker 2>I am.</v>

1670
01:14:08.701 --> 01:14:10.940
<v Speaker 2>And what I have access to and um,</v>

1671
01:14:12.460 --> 01:14:13.293
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1672
01:14:13.500 --> 01:14:16.320
<v Speaker 2>but now having a little one being at </v>
<v Speaker 2>home,</v>

1673
01:14:16.321 --> 01:14:19.200
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gotta like take advantage of my time.</v>

1674
01:14:19.201 --> 01:14:21.720
<v Speaker 2>It's like all you have an hour here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go try and make something happen.</v>

1675
01:14:22.140 --> 01:14:23.580
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's ever,</v>

1676
01:14:23.820 --> 01:14:25.290
<v Speaker 2>ever changing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it just,</v>

1677
01:14:25.291 --> 01:14:26.430
<v Speaker 2>whatever feels right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1678
01:14:26.610 --> 01:14:29.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't think if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it becomes too much of a formula,</v>

1679
01:14:29.911 --> 01:14:32.490
<v Speaker 2>then I think it will lose its,</v>

1680
01:14:34.340 --> 01:14:37.020
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's</v>

1681
01:14:37.870 --> 01:14:39.400
<v Speaker 2>raw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>organic</v>

1682
01:14:40.170 --> 01:14:41.003
<v Speaker 4>kind of</v>

1683
01:14:42.430 --> 01:14:46.980
<v Speaker 2>what I got into it for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of not knowing and not not</v>

1684
01:14:46.990 --> 01:14:48.720
<v Speaker 2>having any rules.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1685
01:14:48.790 --> 01:14:51.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>

1686
01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:52.780
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just</v>

1687
01:14:52.910 --> 01:14:55.610
<v Speaker 5>pins.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a real common thing that you said</v>

1688
01:14:55.611 --> 01:14:57.500
<v Speaker 5>that a lot of people say that once they </v>
<v Speaker 5>had a kid,</v>

1689
01:14:57.501 --> 01:14:59.870
<v Speaker 5>they realized that their free time is </v>
<v Speaker 5>actually precious.</v>

1690
01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:04.230
<v Speaker 5>So because kids demands so much time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>babies demands so much time and you just</v>

1691
01:15:04.250 --> 01:15:06.950
<v Speaker 5>really don't have much to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you start going,</v>

1692
01:15:06.951 --> 01:15:08.360
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the kid's asleep.</v>

1693
01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:10.280
<v Speaker 5>Let's get to work,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1694
01:15:10.370 --> 01:15:11.203
<v Speaker 5>and you actually get more done because </v>
<v Speaker 5>you have children than you did when you </v>

1695
01:15:15.441 --> 01:15:16.020
<v Speaker 5>were free.</v>

1696
01:15:16.020 --> 01:15:16.853
<v Speaker 2>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would sit around and eat us single </v>

1697
01:15:20.940 --> 01:15:23.280
<v Speaker 2>living by myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be working on the software,</v>

1698
01:15:23.340 --> 01:15:25.200
<v Speaker 2>eight hours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd have it loop playing,</v>

1699
01:15:26.670 --> 01:15:27.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just,</v>

1700
01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:31.080
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me go get some food.</v>

1701
01:15:31.081 --> 01:15:32.970
<v Speaker 2>I'll come back to that and maybe some </v>
<v Speaker 2>awesome.</v>

1702
01:15:33.630 --> 01:15:36.420
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I'll get like the genius idea or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1703
01:15:36.810 --> 01:15:38.630
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1704
01:15:38.730 --> 01:15:41.820
<v Speaker 2>I spent two months working on one song </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1705
01:15:41.930 --> 01:15:44.370
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have that much time anymore,</v>

1706
01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:47.340
<v Speaker 2>so it's blessing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1707
01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:49.770
<v Speaker 2>kind of like get your shit together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to do it or you're not.</v>

1708
01:15:49.980 --> 01:15:50.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1709
01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:53.080
<v Speaker 5>Louis C ck was the first person to tell </v>
<v Speaker 5>me that and it didn't,</v>

1710
01:15:53.081 --> 01:15:55.060
<v Speaker 5>it was so counter intuitive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

1711
01:15:55.061 --> 01:15:56.110
<v Speaker 5>really?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

1712
01:15:56.111 --> 01:15:56.861
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I actually,</v>

1713
01:15:56.861 --> 01:15:57.694
<v Speaker 5>I get a lot more done now that I have </v>
<v Speaker 5>children than I did when I was free to </v>

1714
01:16:00.071 --> 01:16:01.600
<v Speaker 5>do whatever I wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was like,</v>

1715
01:16:01.601 --> 01:16:05.080
<v Speaker 5>now I'm just under the gun all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's how I get things done.</v>

1716
01:16:05.690 --> 01:16:07.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well creatively,</v>

1717
01:16:07.371 --> 01:16:08.204
<v Speaker 2>I guess for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we spend so much time out on the </v>

1718
01:16:11.331 --> 01:16:12.590
<v Speaker 2>road,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we're gone a lot,</v>

1719
01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:17.300
<v Speaker 2>so it's a kind of need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my quiet time.</v>

1720
01:16:17.630 --> 01:16:18.463
<v Speaker 2>And there's not really a lot of quiet </v>
<v Speaker 2>time with a bunch of dudes hanging </v>

1721
01:16:21.981 --> 01:16:24.050
<v Speaker 2>around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>smelled like ass.</v>

1722
01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:28.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1723
01:16:29.450 --> 01:16:30.130
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

1724
01:16:30.130 --> 01:16:30.963
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot and I can't really function </v>

1725
01:16:33.051 --> 01:16:34.970
<v Speaker 2>that way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I kind of have to be home in order to</v>

1726
01:16:34.971 --> 01:16:38.300
<v Speaker 2>be creative and do that.</v>

1727
01:16:39.150 --> 01:16:39.983
<v Speaker 5>When you go on the road,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you do like long stretches like you </v>

1728
01:16:41.771 --> 01:16:42.604
<v Speaker 5>on the road for like two months at a </v>
<v Speaker 5>time and have a bunch of dates laid out </v>

1729
01:16:44.881 --> 01:16:45.550
<v Speaker 5>for you?</v>

1730
01:16:45.550 --> 01:16:46.271
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I kind of hate it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

01:17:29.181 --> 01:17:31.070
<v Speaker 2>Somebody just offered me a trip to New </v>
<v Speaker 2>Zealand,</v>

1748
01:17:31.071 --> 01:17:32.780
<v Speaker 2>a vacation trip to New Zealand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1749
01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:35.640
<v Speaker 2>bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not a vacation work.</v>

1750
01:17:37.070 --> 01:17:40.160
<v Speaker 2>16 hours of the fucking plane or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever the hell it is.</v>

1751
01:17:40.161 --> 01:17:40.920
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>

1752
01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:42.420
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing vacation.</v>

1753
01:17:42.421 --> 01:17:43.650
<v Speaker 2>He about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>

1754
01:17:43.780 --> 01:17:45.530
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's beautiful over there,</v>

1755
01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:46.393
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But by the time he can get over that </v>

1756
01:17:47.771 --> 01:17:49.280
<v Speaker 2>you're tired,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just want to go back home.</v>

1757
01:17:49.550 --> 01:17:50.383
<v Speaker 2>I would think that it would be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>vacation for someone who didn't travel </v>

1758
01:17:52.071 --> 01:17:54.260
<v Speaker 2>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But for someone like you or someone like</v>

1759
01:17:54.261 --> 01:17:56.060
<v Speaker 2>me who's always traveling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1760
01:17:56.061 --> 01:17:57.230
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1761
01:17:57.950 --> 01:17:59.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kinda like to be at home.</v>

1762
01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:02.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kind of boring that way.</v>

1763
01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:05.480
<v Speaker 2>It's like I could be at my house for </v>
<v Speaker 2>like three days straight.</v>

1764
01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:06.553
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's also because you travel so </v>

1765
01:18:07.371 --> 01:18:09.350
<v Speaker 2>much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's in direct contrast to that.</v>

1766
01:18:09.351 --> 01:18:11.480
<v Speaker 2>So it's a welcome change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1767
01:18:11.481 --> 01:18:15.770
<v Speaker 2>But I got guys on my crew who get right </v>
<v Speaker 2>off tour and just go hit it.</v>

1768
01:18:16.220 --> 01:18:17.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1769
01:18:17.210 --> 01:18:18.550
<v Speaker 2>Single guys though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1770
01:18:19.070 --> 01:18:19.821
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1771
01:18:19.821 --> 01:18:21.020
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get off the plane,</v>

1772
01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:22.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1773
01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:26.050
<v Speaker 2>from the tour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then just like boss up,</v>

1774
01:18:26.060 --> 01:18:28.240
<v Speaker 2>my boy went to Cuba.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1775
01:18:28.250 --> 01:18:31.940
<v Speaker 2>like going on tour for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for it seemed like what forever.</v>

1776
01:18:31.941 --> 01:18:34.730
<v Speaker 2>And then he's like chilling and Cuba,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like why?</v>

1777
01:18:34.731 --> 01:18:36.020
<v Speaker 2>And that seems exhausting.</v>

1778
01:18:38.310 --> 01:18:42.320
<v Speaker 2>But Cuba is one of those places though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I need to go to,</v>

1779
01:18:43.460 --> 01:18:45.230
<v Speaker 2>I think I need to go do it before it </v>
<v Speaker 2>changes.</v>

1780
01:18:45.260 --> 01:18:46.610
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1816
01:20:01.910 --> 01:20:02.743
<v Speaker 2>It's like walking through that airport,</v>
<v Speaker 2>walking through somewhere and I was </v>

1817
01:20:05.211 --> 01:20:06.410
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

1818
01:20:07.630 --> 01:20:08.040
<v Speaker 2>I felt</v>

1819
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:10.110
<v Speaker 5>like this small of a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a man.</v>

1820
01:20:10.111 --> 01:20:10.944
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

1821
01:20:11.190 --> 01:20:12.910
<v Speaker 5>this guy is beast mode.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1822
01:20:14.600 --> 01:20:15.460
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1823
01:20:15.750 --> 01:20:16.583
<v Speaker 5>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1824
01:20:16.590 --> 01:20:17.423
<v Speaker 5>intentionally they wanted to make </v>
<v Speaker 5>something that was like as in your face </v>

1825
01:20:22.351 --> 01:20:25.320
<v Speaker 5>about the realities of meat as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1826
01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:26.393
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got into it with some people on </v>

1827
01:20:28.441 --> 01:20:31.530
<v Speaker 5>twitter the other day cause I like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like to troll vegans occasionally.</v>

1828
01:20:32.130 --> 01:20:32.963
<v Speaker 5>I see you cause someone was making,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there were some making some stupid shit </v>

1829
01:20:35.281 --> 01:20:37.050
<v Speaker 5>saying that saturated fats are terrible </v>
<v Speaker 5>for you.</v>

1830
01:20:37.051 --> 01:20:38.950
<v Speaker 5>Like they're the another not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're not there.</v>

1831
01:20:38.951 --> 01:20:39.784
<v Speaker 5>Scientific studies that show saturated </v>
<v Speaker 5>fats are actually healthy for you and </v>

1832
01:20:43.171 --> 01:20:44.004
<v Speaker 5>important for you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But people think that if you hunt or if </v>

1833
01:20:46.801 --> 01:20:47.634
<v Speaker 5>you're involved somehow in animals that </v>
<v Speaker 5>year sometime sometimes eating animals </v>

1834
01:20:50.251 --> 01:20:51.720
<v Speaker 5>that you're a cruel person,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you,</v>

1835
01:20:52.170 --> 01:20:55.290
<v Speaker 5>you want to hurt animals.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You want to cause pain and suffering.</v>

1836
01:20:55.420 --> 01:20:56.340
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1837
01:20:56.580 --> 01:20:58.050
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to have anything to do with</v>

1838
01:20:58.051 --> 01:21:00.990
<v Speaker 5>factory farming because I don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 5>be involved in that.</v>

1839
01:21:01.260 --> 01:21:02.093
<v Speaker 5>But the animals that I'm out hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like if I don't get them a wolf's get </v>

1840
01:21:06.780 --> 01:21:09.240
<v Speaker 5>them or a coyote getting him or her </v>
<v Speaker 5>mountain lions getting,</v>

1841
01:21:09.241 --> 01:21:10.650
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're not living forever.</v>

1842
01:21:10.770 --> 01:21:13.860
<v Speaker 5>They have a very short window of time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whether they're alive,</v>

1843
01:21:14.100 --> 01:21:14.701
<v Speaker 5>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if they're,</v>

1844
01:21:14.701 --> 01:21:17.520
<v Speaker 5>if they make it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if a deere makes it a six years old that</v>

1845
01:21:17.521 --> 01:21:20.670
<v Speaker 5>is a really old deer and most of them </v>
<v Speaker 5>they die.</v>

1846
01:21:20.700 --> 01:21:21.533
<v Speaker 5>Long before that when I'm doing is I'm </v>
<v Speaker 5>stumped dipping my feet into that wild </v>

1847
01:21:25.621 --> 01:21:29.730
<v Speaker 5>world and I'm pulling something out of </v>
<v Speaker 5>it and that's where I get all my protein</v>

1848
01:21:29.731 --> 01:21:32.010
<v Speaker 5>from or all my animal protein.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

1849
01:21:32.250 --> 01:21:34.020
<v Speaker 5>I love animals.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think they're amazing.</v>

1850
01:21:34.021 --> 01:21:35.940
<v Speaker 5>I have cats at home.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have dogs.</v>

1851
01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:37.553
<v Speaker 5>It's not a cruelty to animals thing and </v>
<v Speaker 5>this is something that I used to think </v>

1852
01:21:41.581 --> 01:21:45.600
<v Speaker 5>of when I thought of hunters.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I saw some telephone shores.</v>

1853
01:21:45.601 --> 01:21:47.370
<v Speaker 5>Hunter had a dog and he's petting his </v>
<v Speaker 5>dog.</v>

1854
01:21:47.371 --> 01:21:48.204
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how's this motherfucker differentiate </v>

1855
01:21:49.261 --> 01:21:51.780
<v Speaker 5>between this dog and some deer?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's gonna like,</v>

1856
01:21:51.781 --> 01:21:52.860
<v Speaker 5>shoot,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's the lungs out.</v>

1857
01:21:52.861 --> 01:21:55.230
<v Speaker 5>Like how that's Kinda fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of weird.</v>

1858
01:21:56.280 --> 01:21:59.430
<v Speaker 5>But then I got it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like the dog is a killer too,</v>

1859
01:21:59.431 --> 01:22:03.870
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everything life eats life and it's not a</v>

1860
01:22:03.871 --> 01:22:04.704
<v Speaker 5>matter of being cruel.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a matter of sustainability and </v>

1861
01:22:07.741 --> 01:22:10.650
<v Speaker 5>being alive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then there's the reality of hunting.</v>

1862
01:22:10.651 --> 01:22:13.440
<v Speaker 5>Then not everybody can hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not Everybody has the time.</v>

1863
01:22:13.441 --> 01:22:16.470
<v Speaker 5>Not everybody wants to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially in the world that we're,</v>

1864
01:22:16.500 --> 01:22:17.333
<v Speaker 5>we've grown up in with the cities and </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's something that took me several </v>

1865
01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:21.473
<v Speaker 5>years to sort of get into it and really </v>
<v Speaker 5>understand what it's all about and </v>

1866
01:22:23.550 --> 01:22:24.540
<v Speaker 5>educate myself.</v>

1867
01:22:25.230 --> 01:22:26.063
<v Speaker 5>And then once I did educate myself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the most compelling things was </v>

1868
01:22:28.621 --> 01:22:31.980
<v Speaker 5>how ignorant most people are about the </v>
<v Speaker 5>facts of hunting,</v>

1869
01:22:32.370 --> 01:22:35.730
<v Speaker 5>about the facts of wildlife,</v>
<v Speaker 5>about wildlife management,</v>

1870
01:22:35.731 --> 01:22:37.410
<v Speaker 5>and about just where their food comes </v>
<v Speaker 5>from.</v>

1871
01:22:37.620 --> 01:22:41.580
<v Speaker 5>And even about how many animals die </v>
<v Speaker 5>making grain.</v>

1872
01:22:41.700 --> 01:22:43.020
<v Speaker 5>How many of my people say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1873
01:22:43.021 --> 01:22:43.854
<v Speaker 5>I only eat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I only keen and fucking Alfalfa and </v>

1874
01:22:47.550 --> 01:22:48.383
<v Speaker 5>guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That shit's getting chopped up in a </v>

1875
01:22:49.381 --> 01:22:50.214
<v Speaker 5>combine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's chewing up bunnies and fawns </v>

1876
01:22:52.381 --> 01:22:56.340
<v Speaker 5>and rats and mice and sparrows and </v>
<v Speaker 5>ground nesting birds and,</v>

1877
01:22:57.360 --> 01:22:58.193
<v Speaker 5>and you're removing the habitat when you</v>
<v Speaker 5>growing food like that for a lot of </v>

1878
01:23:01.201 --> 01:23:02.034
<v Speaker 5>different wildlife,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wildlife gets displaced and the </v>

1879
01:23:03.751 --> 01:23:06.430
<v Speaker 5>displaced wildlife wind getting preyed </v>
<v Speaker 5>on this.</v>

1880
01:23:06.431 --> 01:23:07.264
<v Speaker 5>It's like there's a lot of factors </v>
<v Speaker 5>involved in gathering food and when </v>

1881
01:23:11.021 --> 01:23:11.854
<v Speaker 5>we're living in cities,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're living in this bizarre natural </v>

1882
01:23:15.641 --> 01:23:16.474
<v Speaker 5>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And when I say cities are a natural </v>

1883
01:23:17.801 --> 01:23:18.634
<v Speaker 5>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they are a natural environment because </v>

1884
01:23:19.991 --> 01:23:20.680
<v Speaker 5>they're there.</v>

1885
01:23:20.680 --> 01:23:21.513
<v Speaker 5>They're everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're a natural environment for </v>

1886
01:23:22.871 --> 01:23:23.704
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like anybody says the cities aren't </v>

1887
01:23:24.671 --> 01:23:26.170
<v Speaker 5>natural man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1888
01:23:26.171 --> 01:23:29.050
<v Speaker 5>how come there's so many of them?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what is nature?</v>

1889
01:23:29.051 --> 01:23:31.240
<v Speaker 5>What does a beehive,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is it a beehive nature?</v>

1890
01:23:31.350 --> 01:23:32.530
<v Speaker 5>A beehive is nature,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1891
01:23:32.650 --> 01:23:33.970
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a fucking be city.</v>

1892
01:23:34.180 --> 01:23:35.320
<v Speaker 5>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They've created a city.</v>

1893
01:23:35.350 --> 01:23:36.850
<v Speaker 5>They know how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They do it everywhere.</v>

1894
01:23:37.090 --> 01:23:37.923
<v Speaker 5>That's the same goddamn thing people do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We create these super complicated </v>

1895
01:23:40.541 --> 01:23:43.210
<v Speaker 5>beehives are call them cities and we </v>
<v Speaker 5>create them all over the world,</v>

1896
01:23:43.300 --> 01:23:44.820
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not like this one city.</v>

1897
01:23:44.821 --> 01:23:46.210
<v Speaker 5>And we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck is that?</v>

1898
01:23:46.990 --> 01:23:49.300
<v Speaker 5>The cities are everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They are people.</v>

1899
01:23:49.630 --> 01:23:50.463
<v Speaker 5>And when people figure shit out and they</v>
<v Speaker 5>have electricity and they have </v>

1900
01:23:52.631 --> 01:23:55.480
<v Speaker 5>agriculture,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then they have surplus and then they,</v>

1901
01:23:55.530 --> 01:23:58.420
<v Speaker 5>they put up fucking walls and make </v>
<v Speaker 5>buildings and then boom,</v>

1902
01:23:58.421 --> 01:24:00.220
<v Speaker 5>we got a city and they're everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You look,</v>

1903
01:24:00.670 --> 01:24:03.250
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think there's,</v>

1904
01:24:03.370 --> 01:24:07.840
<v Speaker 5>there's just some strange detachment </v>
<v Speaker 5>from where our food comes from when it's</v>

1905
01:24:07.841 --> 01:24:09.340
<v Speaker 5>shipped in and trucks all the time.</v>

1906
01:24:09.640 --> 01:24:12.290
<v Speaker 5>So my,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1907
01:24:13.090 --> 01:24:13.923
<v Speaker 5>education into the world of hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a big part of it was like to try to </v>

1908
01:24:16.631 --> 01:24:17.464
<v Speaker 5>figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1909
01:24:18.070 --> 01:24:21.730
<v Speaker 5>I try to figure out bizarre things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like things that don't make sense to me.</v>

1910
01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:23.980
<v Speaker 5>I try to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I tried to figure out,</v>

1911
01:24:24.060 --> 01:24:24.893
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all sorts of weird misconceptions and </v>

1912
01:24:26.741 --> 01:24:27.574
<v Speaker 5>misunderstandings.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I this what fascinates me about people </v>

1913
01:24:30.251 --> 01:24:32.830
<v Speaker 5>that are involved in cults.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it fascinates me,</v>

1914
01:24:32.831 --> 01:24:37.690
<v Speaker 5>but people that have bad conceptions or </v>
<v Speaker 5>bad thoughts about psychedelics that are</v>

1915
01:24:37.691 --> 01:24:39.490
<v Speaker 5>untrue,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like people would think that,</v>

1916
01:24:39.491 --> 01:24:41.710
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>certain things or make it to make you go</v>

1917
01:24:41.711 --> 01:24:43.180
<v Speaker 5>crazy and lose your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What,</v>

1918
01:24:43.181 --> 01:24:43.961
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why is that?</v>

1919
01:24:43.961 --> 01:24:44.830
<v Speaker 5>What makes people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1920
01:24:44.890 --> 01:24:46.990
<v Speaker 5>well there's propaganda films for the </v>
<v Speaker 5>1930s.</v>

1921
01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:48.033
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what started that while it was a guy </v>

1922
01:24:48.461 --> 01:24:49.294
<v Speaker 5>named William Randolph hearst,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll actually profited from marijuana </v>

1923
01:24:51.671 --> 01:24:52.481
<v Speaker 5>being illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1924
01:24:52.481 --> 01:24:53.260
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

1925
01:24:53.260 --> 01:24:55.540
<v Speaker 5>And he get,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm fascinated by shit like that.</v>

1926
01:24:55.600 --> 01:24:57.550
<v Speaker 5>So the food thing was always fascinating</v>
<v Speaker 5>to me.</v>

1927
01:24:57.551 --> 01:24:58.384
<v Speaker 5>Like how was actually just go to a store</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you get a piece of meat and we have </v>

1928
01:25:01.061 --> 01:25:02.740
<v Speaker 5>no idea where the fuck this meat came </v>
<v Speaker 5>from.</v>

1929
01:25:02.741 --> 01:25:04.120
<v Speaker 5>We'd literally just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we don't even care.</v>

1930
01:25:04.270 --> 01:25:05.680
<v Speaker 5>We throw it in the supermarket,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1931
01:25:05.710 --> 01:25:07.450
<v Speaker 5>throw it in the cart,</v>
<v Speaker 5>go through supermarket,</v>

1932
01:25:07.451 --> 01:25:08.284
<v Speaker 5>give that guy a piece of plastic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He runs it through the machine and </v>

1933
01:25:10.001 --> 01:25:12.310
<v Speaker 5>you're out the door.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's strange.</v>

1934
01:25:12.340 --> 01:25:15.610
<v Speaker 5>It's very odd when that's a piece of </v>
<v Speaker 5>life.</v>

1935
01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:18.640
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think about that too,</v>

1936
01:25:18.910 --> 01:25:21.670
<v Speaker 5>but I don't hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but do you eat me?</v>

1937
01:25:21.940 --> 01:25:24.640
<v Speaker 5>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's not guilty.</v>

1938
01:25:24.670 --> 01:25:28.750
<v Speaker 5>It's normal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Deep meet everybody like 90% this is the</v>

1939
01:25:28.751 --> 01:25:33.700
<v Speaker 5>fact of the world eats meat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He right 90 95 depending on who you ask,</v>

1940
01:25:33.970 --> 01:25:37.270
<v Speaker 5>but it's at least 90 of the world eats </v>
<v Speaker 5>meat.</v>

1941
01:25:37.420 --> 01:25:39.370
<v Speaker 5>Even Vegetarians,</v>
<v Speaker 5>most vegetarian,</v>

1942
01:25:39.610 --> 01:25:41.770
<v Speaker 5>some asshole said to me the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hilarious.</v>

1943
01:25:41.950 --> 01:25:43.840
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm 90% vegetarian and I think,</v>

1944
01:25:43.990 --> 01:25:45.160
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>shut the fuck up.</v>

1945
01:25:45.610 --> 01:25:48.640
<v Speaker 5>Does you can't say that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How do you do that with how?</v>

1946
01:25:48.700 --> 01:25:51.160
<v Speaker 5>That's not 90% vegetarian.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's not real.</v>

1947
01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:55.660
<v Speaker 5>There's no such thing as 90% vegetarian.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You are 100% not vegetarian.</v>

1948
01:25:55.780 --> 01:25:59.350
<v Speaker 5>If you eat meat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's not 90% vegetarian.</v>

1949
01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:01.353
<v Speaker 5>He's an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's a convenient moral ground asshole </v>

1950
01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:07.190
<v Speaker 5>who's just trying to let everybody know </v>
<v Speaker 5>he's better than you because most of the</v>

1951
01:26:07.191 --> 01:26:10.400
<v Speaker 5>time he doesn't eat meat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just fuck you.</v>

1952
01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.910
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll just go ahead and shut the fuck up.</v>

1953
01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:17.180
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was just trying to be,</v>

1954
01:26:17.250 --> 01:26:21.260
<v Speaker 5>make an argument against hunting and a </v>
<v Speaker 5>about about people who do it.</v>

1955
01:26:21.410 --> 01:26:22.101
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just,</v>

1956
01:26:22.101 --> 01:26:22.934
<v Speaker 5>he's a fool,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's convenient for people because </v>

1957
01:26:25.461 --> 01:26:27.980
<v Speaker 5>they're completely detached on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>on a daily basis.</v>

1958
01:26:27.981 --> 01:26:30.770
<v Speaker 5>If you go to your office every day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you wake up in the morning,</v>

1959
01:26:30.771 --> 01:26:32.660
<v Speaker 5>you have your breakfast,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you drive to work,</v>

1960
01:26:32.900 --> 01:26:34.700
<v Speaker 5>you go to work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>At the end of the day,</v>

1961
01:26:34.701 --> 01:26:35.950
<v Speaker 5>you go to the gym,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you go home,</v>

1962
01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:37.520
<v Speaker 5>you watch a little television,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you crash,</v>

1963
01:26:37.670 --> 01:26:38.503
<v Speaker 5>you get up in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you do that again and you do it five </v>

1964
01:26:39.891 --> 01:26:42.110
<v Speaker 5>days a week.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're left with two fucking days,</v>

1965
01:26:42.350 --> 01:26:43.790
<v Speaker 5>two days,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Saturday and Sunday.</v>

1966
01:26:43.820 --> 01:26:45.800
<v Speaker 5>If you're lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if you have family,</v>

1967
01:26:45.980 --> 01:26:48.410
<v Speaker 5>those days are spoken for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you have friends,</v>

1968
01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:50.060
<v Speaker 5>those days are spoken for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you have hobbies,</v>

1969
01:26:50.330 --> 01:26:52.390
<v Speaker 5>so where's your gathering food come </v>
<v Speaker 5>from?</v>

1970
01:26:52.430 --> 01:26:54.410
<v Speaker 5>Like you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to make a concerted effort.</v>

1971
01:26:54.410 --> 01:26:55.243
<v Speaker 5>If you really want to be a part of this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you really want to deeply understand </v>

1972
01:27:00.891 --> 01:27:01.724
<v Speaker 5>where your food comes from,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to make a concerted effort to </v>

1973
01:27:03.501 --> 01:27:04.334
<v Speaker 5>either grow it or acquire it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like somehow or another you have to go </v>

1974
01:27:06.711 --> 01:27:07.544
<v Speaker 5>to a farm and talk to the people that </v>
<v Speaker 5>are growing the food and buy it from </v>

1975
01:27:10.011 --> 01:27:11.600
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Go to a farmer's market.</v>

1976
01:27:11.601 --> 01:27:13.760
<v Speaker 5>You can meet them like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I go to farmer's markets.</v>

1977
01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:14.673
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like meeting the people that work on </v>

1978
01:27:16.431 --> 01:27:18.620
<v Speaker 5>the farms.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I asked them to talk to them about it.</v>

1979
01:27:19.310 --> 01:27:22.250
<v Speaker 5>But the meat thing is the big </v>
<v Speaker 5>detachment.</v>

1980
01:27:22.251 --> 01:27:24.260
<v Speaker 5>Everybody kind of understands.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You plant a seed,</v>

1981
01:27:24.261 --> 01:27:25.820
<v Speaker 5>you water it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>tomato comes out,</v>

1982
01:27:26.150 --> 01:27:28.760
<v Speaker 5>they kind of get that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the animal part,</v>

1983
01:27:29.150 --> 01:27:29.983
<v Speaker 5>the vast majority of people who eat meat</v>
<v Speaker 5>just do not understand the whole </v>

1984
01:27:33.621 --> 01:27:34.880
<v Speaker 5>process.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't,</v>

1985
01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.500
<v Speaker 5>they don't want to know.</v>

1986
01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:38.060
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they just buy a burger.</v>

1987
01:27:39.770 --> 01:27:40.830
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1988
01:27:41.540 --> 01:27:45.830
<v Speaker 5>I'm starting to know a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 5>and it freaks me out of it.</v>

1989
01:27:46.220 --> 01:27:49.210
<v Speaker 5>It's a freak out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

1990
01:27:49.550 --> 01:27:50.383
<v Speaker 5>it's a freak out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I haven't quite switched over to </v>

1991
01:27:52.970 --> 01:27:55.480
<v Speaker 5>veganism or going out and hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1992
01:27:55.640 --> 01:27:56.473
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my thought was I was going to do one or </v>

1993
01:27:56.901 --> 01:27:58.520
<v Speaker 5>two things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was either going to become a Vegan,</v>

1994
01:27:58.521 --> 01:28:01.040
<v Speaker 5>I was going to become a hunter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I became a hunter.</v>

1995
01:28:01.460 --> 01:28:03.890
<v Speaker 5>And one of the reasons why I became a </v>
<v Speaker 5>hunter is,</v>

1996
01:28:03.980 --> 01:28:05.690
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the food's delicious.</v>

1997
01:28:05.810 --> 01:28:07.830
<v Speaker 5>It's good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And those animals aren't,</v>

1998
01:28:08.060 --> 01:28:08.893
<v Speaker 5>they're not living forever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I becoming fairies and curing </v>

1999
01:28:11.901 --> 01:28:12.734
<v Speaker 5>cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you don't shoot them and they're </v>

2000
01:28:14.061 --> 01:28:15.950
<v Speaker 5>getting eaten by all kinds of shit </v>
<v Speaker 5>around them,</v>

2001
01:28:15.951 --> 01:28:16.431
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're just,</v>

2002
01:28:16.431 --> 01:28:19.400
<v Speaker 5>you're just eating them as well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

2003
01:28:19.401 --> 01:28:21.580
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a,</v>

2004
01:28:21.581 --> 01:28:25.940
<v Speaker 5>it's a weird disconnect that we have </v>
<v Speaker 5>about where food comes from.</v>

2005
01:28:25.940 --> 01:28:28.310
<v Speaker 5>And life itself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like live is not permanent.</v>

2006
01:28:28.311 --> 01:28:29.440
<v Speaker 5>It's temporary.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

2007
01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:31.130
<v Speaker 5>it's here and it's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's fleeting.</v>

2008
01:28:31.370 --> 01:28:33.350
<v Speaker 5>It should be respected,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2009
01:28:33.380 --> 01:28:34.213
<v Speaker 5>it should be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think one of the best ways to </v>

2010
01:28:35.661 --> 01:28:38.630
<v Speaker 5>respect these animals in the sounds like</v>
<v Speaker 5>total,</v>

2011
01:28:39.380 --> 01:28:43.010
<v Speaker 5>totally counter intuitive,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but as to cut them and eat them,</v>

2012
01:28:43.340 --> 01:28:45.560
<v Speaker 5>they become a part of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They sustain you.</v>

2013
01:28:45.980 --> 01:28:46.581
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2014
01:28:46.581 --> 01:28:47.414
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have a deep appreciation for them </v>

2015
01:28:48.861 --> 01:28:51.580
<v Speaker 5>because they literally sustain you </v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

2016
01:28:51.590 --> 01:28:53.840
<v Speaker 5>Part of what makes you live.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2017
01:28:54.290 --> 01:28:56.600
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a real,</v>

2018
01:28:57.650 --> 01:28:59.810
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We live in Texas,</v>

2019
01:28:59.811 --> 01:29:02.280
<v Speaker 5>a lot of hunting and in Austin</v>

2020
01:29:02.460 --> 01:29:05.100
<v Speaker 2>when you were living there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of my friends,</v>

2021
01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:07.313
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they hunt and so you know that they're </v>

2022
01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:11.280
<v Speaker 2>big on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 2>but I had a,</v>

2025
01:29:16.260 --> 01:29:19.410
<v Speaker 2>I had a couple of experiences with guns </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was younger.</v>

2026
01:29:20.460 --> 01:29:24.150
<v Speaker 2>That kind of freaked me out from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from that,</v>

01:29:24.180 --> 01:29:25.013
<v Speaker 2>one of them was me being a kid and I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a play gun and I kind of colored </v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>hard.</v>

2060
01:30:49.401 --> 01:30:52.750

<v Speaker 2>that's what he does all the time.</v>

2069
01:31:08.511 --> 01:31:09.970
<v Speaker 2>It was outside of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2070
01:31:10.340 --> 01:31:10.900
<v Speaker 2>a little</v>

2071
01:31:10.900 --> 01:31:13.420
<v Speaker 1>outside of Austin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's always gone sending me photos,</v>

<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2073
01:31:14.771 --> 01:31:16.510

<v Speaker 1>like outside of Texas,</v>

2074
01:31:16.511 --> 01:31:19.210
<v Speaker 1>they have a giant problem with pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have to hunt them.</v>

2075
01:31:19.330 --> 01:31:20.770
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can go to town on them.</v>

2076
01:31:20.950 --> 01:31:21.910
<v Speaker 1>They're everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2077
01:31:22.030 --> 01:31:23.380
<v Speaker 1>They have no limits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do it.</v>

2078
01:31:23.381 --> 01:31:25.450
<v Speaker 1>They do it from helicopters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2079
01:31:25.451 --> 01:31:26.284
<v Speaker 1>they have,</v>

01:31:27.731 --> 01:31:32.110
<v Speaker 1>hunting where they take people up in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in helicopters and they're shooting pigs</v>

2081
01:31:32.111 --> 01:31:32.944
<v Speaker 1>because it's the only way to eradicate </v>
<v Speaker 1>them from farms because there's so many </v>

2082
01:31:35.171 --> 01:31:36.004
<v Speaker 1>of them and they do billions of dollars </v>
<v Speaker 1>worth of damage just in Texas in crop </v>

2083
01:31:39.611 --> 01:31:43.900
<v Speaker 1>destruction every year there are wild.</v>

<v Speaker 1>there's not enough mountain mines and </v>

2085
01:31:46.091 --> 01:31:49.960
<v Speaker 1>there's no wolves to kill them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>realize there were so dangerous to,</v>

2086
01:31:50.200 --> 01:31:51.040
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're very dangerous.</v>

2087
01:31:51.110 --> 01:31:53.320
<v Speaker 1>The big ones especially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll fuck you up.</v>

2088
01:31:53.370 --> 01:31:54.790
<v Speaker 1>That's what I heard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I said,</v>

2089
01:31:54.791 --> 01:31:57.100
<v Speaker 1>why I don't go out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll fuck you up.</v>

<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2091
01:32:00.010 --> 01:32:01.690
<v Speaker 5>The first king,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the original king,</v>

2092
01:32:02.620 --> 01:32:03.700
<v Speaker 5>the one who,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2093
01:32:03.790 --> 01:32:04.623

<v Speaker 5>and the game of thrones,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the hot blonde lady.</v>

2095
01:32:09.070 --> 01:32:11.800
<v Speaker 5>Her husband died because,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2096
01:32:11.860 --> 01:32:14.170
<v Speaker 5>he got killed by a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by a pig.</v>

2097
01:32:15.370 --> 01:32:16.390
<v Speaker 5>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is this in the show?</v>

2098
01:32:16.420 --> 01:32:18.190
<v Speaker 5>I don't know the shell game of throne.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not Real life.</v>

2099
01:32:18.191 --> 01:32:19.024
<v Speaker 5>You didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean in the movie he died from a wild </v>

2100
01:32:21.101 --> 01:32:24.390
<v Speaker 5>boar,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they get fucking big too.</v>

2101
01:32:25.400 --> 01:32:29.560
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a 400 pound wild heart is not uncommon.</v>

2102
01:32:30.190 --> 01:32:33.340
<v Speaker 5>That's real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I never seen with them in real life.</v>

2103
01:32:33.610 --> 01:32:35.830
<v Speaker 5>They're crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look and they're all black and they have</v>

2104
01:32:35.860 --> 01:32:39.880
<v Speaker 5>long snouts in their tusks come out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have these white tusks.</v>

2105
01:32:39.970 --> 01:32:41.380
<v Speaker 5>Like when you see when it real life,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>

2106
01:32:41.410 --> 01:32:43.540
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you hear him in real life.</v>

2107
01:32:43.930 --> 01:32:44.763
<v Speaker 5>First time I ever went pig hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was with my friend Steve Rinella and </v>

2108
01:32:47.351 --> 01:32:49.240
<v Speaker 5>we're on this farm or this a ranch.</v>

2109
01:32:49.240 --> 01:32:51.100
<v Speaker 5>It's not far away from here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's huge.</v>

2110
01:32:51.101 --> 01:32:53.500
<v Speaker 5>Biggest ranch in California,</v>
<v Speaker 5>270,000 acres.</v>

2111
01:32:53.501 --> 01:32:55.960
<v Speaker 5>It's called the home ranch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>

2112
01:32:56.350 --> 01:32:57.183
<v Speaker 5>we were walking down this road and we </v>
<v Speaker 5>heard some snaps and some noises in the </v>

2113
01:33:00.131 --> 01:33:02.170
<v Speaker 5>bushes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like it's really thick brush.</v>

2114
01:33:02.410 --> 01:33:03.243
<v Speaker 5>And then we heard these pigs fighting </v>
<v Speaker 5>with each other and they were like </v>

2115
01:33:05.260 --> 01:33:10.260
<v Speaker 5>Damon's mass eye and they're like no </v>
<v Speaker 5>more than 30 yards,</v>

2116
01:33:11.771 --> 01:33:12.604
<v Speaker 5>20 yards away from us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're like right there and they're </v>

2117
01:33:13.931 --> 01:33:16.750
<v Speaker 5>duking it out in the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and like these are monsters man.</v>

2118
01:33:16.751 --> 01:33:17.584
<v Speaker 5>They sound like monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It freaked me out more than honey bears </v>

2119
01:33:21.191 --> 01:33:23.530
<v Speaker 5>more than hunting elk but not more than </v>
<v Speaker 5>elk.</v>

2120
01:33:23.531 --> 01:33:25.840
<v Speaker 5>Elk is probably the biggest freak out </v>
<v Speaker 5>cause they scream,</v>

2121
01:33:26.170 --> 01:33:27.003
<v Speaker 5>they day bugle and they like a thousand </v>
<v Speaker 5>pounds and they look majestically they </v>

2122
01:33:29.951 --> 01:33:32.350
<v Speaker 5>have trees growing out of their head.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These giant antlers.</v>

2123
01:33:32.700 --> 01:33:35.920
<v Speaker 5>And then did you see the antlers that </v>
<v Speaker 5>are in the front there over by the front</v>

2124
01:33:35.921 --> 01:33:37.180
<v Speaker 5>door is locked in.</v>

2125
01:33:37.210 --> 01:33:38.420
<v Speaker 5>That's elk,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those,</v>

2126
01:33:38.421 --> 01:33:41.020
<v Speaker 5>those,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's like a thousand pound animal with</v>

2127
01:33:41.021 --> 01:33:44.470
<v Speaker 5>these gigantic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean there they're immense,</v>

2128
01:33:44.471 --> 01:33:47.440
<v Speaker 5>immense majestic animals.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those are the biggest freak outs.</v>

2129
01:33:47.590 --> 01:33:50.770
<v Speaker 5>Just cause you feel like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're hunting some mystical creature.</v>

2130
01:33:50.950 --> 01:33:53.530
<v Speaker 5>Where do you find those?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those were into home ranch two.</v>

2131
01:33:53.531 --> 01:33:55.510
<v Speaker 5>One of them was one of those was from to</v>
<v Speaker 5>hone ranch.</v>

2132
01:33:55.511 --> 01:33:59.380
<v Speaker 5>One of them was from Colorado,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2133
01:34:00.470 --> 01:34:02.590
<v Speaker 5>rising.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the pig thing is,</v>

2134
01:34:02.591 --> 01:34:03.424
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's actually look at that fucking </v>

2135
01:34:04.961 --> 01:34:06.220
<v Speaker 5>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the size of that thing.</v>

2136
01:34:06.690 --> 01:34:11.440
<v Speaker 5>11 year old hunter bags,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a 1050 pound wild boar.</v>

2137
01:34:12.280 --> 01:34:16.030
<v Speaker 5>What the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What the fuck?</v>

2138
01:34:16.210 --> 01:34:19.540
<v Speaker 5>First of all with a pistol,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is a perspective shot,</v>

2139
01:34:19.780 --> 01:34:23.140
<v Speaker 5>which is actually kind of important </v>
<v Speaker 5>because like that boy is way behind that</v>

2140
01:34:23.141 --> 01:34:25.450
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's not like right next to it.</v>

2141
01:34:25.451 --> 01:34:27.760
<v Speaker 5>So if he's behind it by just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2142
01:34:27.761 --> 01:34:30.090
<v Speaker 5>six or seven feet and the camera's on </v>
<v Speaker 5>the ground,</v>

2143
01:34:30.091 --> 01:34:31.180
<v Speaker 5>they're shooting at an eye level.</v>

2144
01:34:31.450 --> 01:34:33.370
<v Speaker 5>It makes it look a lot bigger than it </v>
<v Speaker 5>really is.</v>

2145
01:34:33.400 --> 01:34:35.260
<v Speaker 5>That's how they do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2146
01:34:35.320 --> 01:34:36.153
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but a thousand pounds is a fucking </v>

2147
01:34:38.531 --> 01:34:40.660
<v Speaker 5>thousand pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a giant ass pig.</v>

2148
01:34:41.530 --> 01:34:44.170
<v Speaker 5>If you ever seen Hogzilla have I seen </v>
<v Speaker 5>it?</v>

2149
01:34:44.410 --> 01:34:46.570
<v Speaker 5>If you've seen the images of Hogzilla,</v>
<v Speaker 5>have you heard of this?</v>

2150
01:34:46.630 --> 01:34:49.930
<v Speaker 5>This is like one of the biggest wild </v>
<v Speaker 5>pigs who was ever killed.</v>

2151
01:34:50.170 --> 01:34:52.480
<v Speaker 5>It was a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I believe it was in Georgia.</v>

2152
01:34:52.990 --> 01:34:54.460
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that,</v>

2153
01:34:54.520 --> 01:34:57.100
<v Speaker 5>did they have a photo of Hogzilla check?</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's one.</v>

2154
01:34:57.230 --> 01:34:58.730
<v Speaker 5>It's hanging there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That one right there,</v>

2155
01:34:58.731 --> 01:34:59.564
<v Speaker 5>Jeremy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look at the size of the one that's </v>

2156
01:35:00.351 --> 01:35:03.520
<v Speaker 5>hanging next to this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look at the fucking size.</v>

2157
01:35:03.530 --> 01:35:05.570
<v Speaker 5>That thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's not a perspective shot.</v>

2158
01:35:05.780 --> 01:35:07.610
<v Speaker 5>That guy standing right next to that </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>

2159
01:35:09.340 --> 01:35:10.580
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2160
01:35:10.581 --> 01:35:14.540
<v Speaker 5>What first of all are those his balls up</v>
<v Speaker 5>a top.</v>

2161
01:35:14.630 --> 01:35:16.820
<v Speaker 5>Cause if that's his balls.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Respect.</v>

2162
01:35:21.910 --> 01:35:22.743
<v Speaker 5>That's a crazy sack.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's like a couple of watermelons and </v>

2163
01:35:25.401 --> 01:35:26.450
<v Speaker 5>an old ladies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pantyhose.</v>

2164
01:35:27.240 --> 01:35:32.240
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a giant fucking giant balls.</v>

2165
01:35:32.750 --> 01:35:34.460
<v Speaker 5>How big was it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Over a thousand pounds?</v>

2166
01:35:34.670 --> 01:35:37.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2167
01:35:37.240 --> 01:35:37.810
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

2168
01:35:37.810 --> 01:35:38.643
<v Speaker 5>Wildly considered widely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Originally it was widely considered a </v>

2169
01:35:41.051 --> 01:35:41.884
<v Speaker 5>hoax.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hmm.</v>

2170
01:35:42.340 --> 01:35:43.173
<v Speaker 5>Well they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what happens is they take domestic pigs </v>

2171
01:35:46.361 --> 01:35:50.380
<v Speaker 5>are one of the few animals that morph </v>
<v Speaker 5>automatically when they get out into the</v>

2172
01:35:50.381 --> 01:35:51.214
<v Speaker 5>wild.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if you have a pig and he's your </v>

2173
01:35:52.511 --> 01:35:55.330
<v Speaker 5>buddy and you let them loose out in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>forest,</v>

2174
01:35:55.480 --> 01:35:58.180
<v Speaker 5>they change physically.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Their nose gets longer,</v>

2175
01:35:58.390 --> 01:36:02.380
<v Speaker 5>their hair gets shaggier and their teeth</v>
<v Speaker 5>grow along or their tusks grow and their</v>

2176
01:36:02.381 --> 01:36:03.214
<v Speaker 5>behavior changes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They go feral and they go feral really </v>

2177
01:36:05.831 --> 01:36:06.664
<v Speaker 5>quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think within like a couple of months </v>

2178
01:36:09.310 --> 01:36:12.610
<v Speaker 5>they start physical transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know that.</v>

2179
01:36:12.640 --> 01:36:15.340
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're weird animal like wild boars and</v>

2180
01:36:15.341 --> 01:36:17.650
<v Speaker 5>wild pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like do you see a wild boar?</v>

2181
01:36:17.651 --> 01:36:18.484
<v Speaker 5>Like dark hair,</v>
<v Speaker 5>thick scrubby and then you see a pig </v>

2182
01:36:20.591 --> 01:36:23.410
<v Speaker 5>like at a farm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Same species.</v>

2183
01:36:23.830 --> 01:36:24.663
<v Speaker 5>Same animal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is fucking nuts there that it's </v>

2184
01:36:27.521 --> 01:36:30.190
<v Speaker 5>all one genus.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's called [inaudible].</v>

2185
01:36:30.220 --> 01:36:33.850
<v Speaker 5>That's the type of animal it is and they</v>
<v Speaker 5>can interbreed with each other.</v>

2186
01:36:34.180 --> 01:36:35.013
<v Speaker 5>They're the same thing and that's why </v>
<v Speaker 5>when you go see wild pigs like domestic </v>

2187
01:36:39.071 --> 01:36:39.904
<v Speaker 5>pigs that get loose and they become </v>
<v Speaker 5>feral and then they start breeding in </v>

2188
01:36:42.191 --> 01:36:43.280
<v Speaker 5>the wild.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They the,</v>

2189
01:36:43.300 --> 01:36:45.130
<v Speaker 5>they're black,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're black.</v>

2190
01:36:45.131 --> 01:36:47.220
<v Speaker 5>They have a thick,</v>
<v Speaker 5>thick coat on the,</v>

2191
01:36:47.290 --> 01:36:48.123
<v Speaker 5>around where their neck area is because </v>
<v Speaker 5>they fight and they tear each other </v>

2192
01:36:50.921 --> 01:36:51.754
<v Speaker 5>apart.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So all around like from their face down </v>

2193
01:36:54.311 --> 01:36:55.144
<v Speaker 5>to like a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where their heart is on their chest is </v>

2194
01:36:57.550 --> 01:36:59.050
<v Speaker 5>super thick,</v>
<v Speaker 5>thick,</v>

2195
01:36:59.051 --> 01:37:03.640
<v Speaker 5>hide like the thickest fuck like a shoe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the bottom of a shoe.</v>

2196
01:37:03.641 --> 01:37:06.450
<v Speaker 5>It's incredible how thick it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So um,</v>

2197
01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:07.353
<v Speaker 5>people that hunt them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to be careful like with bows </v>

2198
01:37:09.221 --> 01:37:11.020
<v Speaker 5>and arrows that you don't hit them in </v>
<v Speaker 5>that area.</v>

2199
01:37:11.021 --> 01:37:11.854
<v Speaker 5>Cause like if you have a weak bow know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pulling back a lot of weight with a </v>

2200
01:37:14.081 --> 01:37:16.270
<v Speaker 5>really sharp Arrow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he won't even go through them.</v>

2201
01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:18.350
<v Speaker 2>Do you use a bow?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes?</v>

2202
01:37:19.010 --> 01:37:21.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2203
01:37:22.280 --> 01:37:27.280
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea is there's this girl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she works with this hat shop and uh,</v>

2204
01:37:29.270 --> 01:37:33.680
<v Speaker 2>I walked in and she's got this pet </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking pigs.</v>

2205
01:37:33.681 --> 01:37:37.160
<v Speaker 2>I could just imagine that thing like </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting loose for a couple of months.</v>

2206
01:37:37.161 --> 01:37:40.100
<v Speaker 2>Like have you seen my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was it a potbelly pig?</v>

2207
01:37:40.101 --> 01:37:42.290
<v Speaker 2>One of those little ones?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2208
01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:43.490
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that the same deal?</v>

2209
01:37:43.550 --> 01:37:44.600
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

2210
01:37:44.660 --> 01:37:47.130
<v Speaker 2>I think at potbelly pigs or like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a Chore Chihuahua,</v>

2211
01:37:47.770 --> 01:37:48.603
<v Speaker 5>the Chihuahua,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the reality of domestic dogs is that </v>

2212
01:37:51.811 --> 01:37:54.100
<v Speaker 5>domestic dogs all share,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2213
01:37:54.210 --> 01:37:57.180
<v Speaker 5>genetics with a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which means somehow or another,</v>

2214
01:37:57.181 --> 01:38:00.510
<v Speaker 5>we don't exactly know how they did it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but through selective breeding,</v>

2215
01:38:00.990 --> 01:38:02.700
<v Speaker 5>a wolf became a Chihuahua.</v>

2216
01:38:06.440 --> 01:38:07.890
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2217
01:38:07.990 --> 01:38:08.823
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was having this conversation with a </v>

2218
01:38:12.230 --> 01:38:17.230
<v Speaker 5>buddy of mine in Australia of about how </v>
<v Speaker 5>a Chihuahua became a Chihuahua.</v>

2219
01:38:18.200 --> 01:38:20.600
<v Speaker 5>And what did he say we could,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we didn't know.</v>

2220
01:38:20.660 --> 01:38:22.160
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we were just like,</v>

2221
01:38:22.161 --> 01:38:23.960
<v Speaker 5>that's how fucking crazy is that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2222
01:38:23.961 --> 01:38:26.420
<v Speaker 5>there's no clear map.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not like,</v>

2223
01:38:26.421 --> 01:38:27.920
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a lagger,</v>

2224
01:38:28.030 --> 01:38:28.863
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to lager is like a line mates with a </v>

2225
01:38:30.441 --> 01:38:31.880
<v Speaker 5>tiger.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It makes a logger.</v>

2226
01:38:32.030 --> 01:38:33.050
<v Speaker 5>Just bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2227
01:38:33.080 --> 01:38:34.730
<v Speaker 5>Pretty bad as well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're also,</v>

2228
01:38:34.731 --> 01:38:37.570
<v Speaker 5>they're so big because they want,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's either a,</v>

2229
01:38:37.790 --> 01:38:42.740
<v Speaker 5>I think it's a male lion and a female </v>
<v Speaker 5>tiger and,</v>

2230
01:38:42.770 --> 01:38:43.603
<v Speaker 5>or maybe a male tigers and female line,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it has to be that specific </v>

2231
01:38:45.651 --> 01:38:46.484
<v Speaker 5>combination.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And what happens is when that </v>

2232
01:38:48.531 --> 01:38:49.364
<v Speaker 5>combination takes place,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't receive the gene that </v>

2233
01:38:52.401 --> 01:38:54.890
<v Speaker 5>regulates size.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they keep growing.</v>

2234
01:38:57.010 --> 01:38:57.843
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2235
01:38:58.110 --> 01:38:59.160
<v Speaker 5>They're sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're enormous.</v>

2236
01:38:59.161 --> 01:39:02.190
<v Speaker 5>They're way bigger than a lion and way </v>
<v Speaker 5>bigger than a tiger.</v>

2237
01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:04.200
<v Speaker 5>Like laggers are enormous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>

2238
01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:05.153
<v Speaker 5>they don't even seem real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why they were in Napoleon </v>

2239
01:39:07.591 --> 01:39:09.430
<v Speaker 5>dynamite's favorite animal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2240
01:39:10.950 --> 01:39:13.350
<v Speaker 5>Classic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A classic by the way.</v>

2241
01:39:13.380 --> 01:39:14.400
<v Speaker 5>But see,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that makes sense.</v>

2242
01:39:14.401 --> 01:39:15.990
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Align mates with a tiger,</v>

2243
01:39:15.991 --> 01:39:18.810
<v Speaker 5>you can see that they have similarities </v>
<v Speaker 5>in their features.</v>

2244
01:39:18.850 --> 01:39:19.680
<v Speaker 5>Gotcha.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>

2245
01:39:19.680 --> 01:39:23.520
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>chihuahuas and all domestic dogs,</v>

2246
01:39:23.521 --> 01:39:25.590
<v Speaker 5>we don't really know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We,</v>

2247
01:39:25.680 --> 01:39:29.670
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of speculation and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>believe that wolves became friendly with</v>

2248
01:39:29.671 --> 01:39:32.580
<v Speaker 5>people because we're feeding them and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then they become more docile.</v>

2249
01:39:32.840 --> 01:39:33.673
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was a radio lab podcast that </v>

2250
01:39:35.580 --> 01:39:40.580
<v Speaker 5>talked about breeding foxes and within a</v>
<v Speaker 5>decade they had killed,</v>

2251
01:39:40.770 --> 01:39:41.603
<v Speaker 5>they were breeding foxes and they would </v>
<v Speaker 5>kill any fox that showed any sort of </v>

2252
01:39:44.221 --> 01:39:45.054
<v Speaker 5>aggression or any and that there was </v>
<v Speaker 5>trying to be dominant with a growl at </v>

2253
01:39:47.821 --> 01:39:49.020
<v Speaker 5>people that any,</v>
<v Speaker 5>any,</v>

2254
01:39:49.021 --> 01:39:50.910
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>any unfavorable characteristics,</v>

2255
01:39:50.911 --> 01:39:51.744
<v Speaker 5>they killed them.</v>

2256
01:39:51.900 --> 01:39:52.733
<v Speaker 5>And within 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the genes change to the point where all </v>

2257
01:39:57.661 --> 01:40:01.950
<v Speaker 5>the foxes had droopy ears.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Their jaws became less masculine,</v>

2258
01:40:01.951 --> 01:40:05.010
<v Speaker 5>they became smaller,</v>
<v Speaker 5>their behavior completely changed.</v>

2259
01:40:05.011 --> 01:40:07.860
<v Speaker 5>They all became like a domestic pet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Within 10 years,</v>

2260
01:40:07.920 --> 01:40:09.540
<v Speaker 5>they'd literally became a different </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>

2261
01:40:09.900 --> 01:40:10.733
<v Speaker 5>And so the thought is that this is what </v>
<v Speaker 5>happened with wolves and that wolves </v>

2262
01:40:15.270 --> 01:40:16.103
<v Speaker 5>being around campfires with people like </v>
<v Speaker 5>primitive printer of people tens and </v>

2263
01:40:19.621 --> 01:40:21.660
<v Speaker 5>20,000,</v>
<v Speaker 5>40,000 years ago,</v>

2264
01:40:22.020 --> 01:40:22.853
<v Speaker 5>that we slowly but surely started having</v>
<v Speaker 5>relationships with these animals where </v>

2265
01:40:26.371 --> 01:40:28.680
<v Speaker 5>they would protect us from the other </v>
<v Speaker 5>wolves because we would feed them.</v>

2266
01:40:28.980 --> 01:40:31.950
<v Speaker 5>And so they would become more docile and</v>
<v Speaker 5>more,</v>

2267
01:40:32.040 --> 01:40:33.780
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>more dependent upon us.</v>

2268
01:40:34.020 --> 01:40:34.860
<v Speaker 5>So they would,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2269
01:40:34.890 --> 01:40:36.690
<v Speaker 5>they would be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they would give in,</v>

2270
01:40:36.870 --> 01:40:37.530
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they would,</v>

2271
01:40:37.530 --> 01:40:38.363
<v Speaker 5>they would be submissive to us and so </v>
<v Speaker 5>their ears started to flop like a dog's </v>

2272
01:40:42.151 --> 01:40:45.360
<v Speaker 5>ear and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they became less aggressive.</v>

2273
01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:46.193
<v Speaker 5>They would respond to people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could train them and teach them to </v>

2274
01:40:49.261 --> 01:40:50.094
<v Speaker 5>hunt with you cause they got a reward </v>
<v Speaker 5>out of being a part of the community of </v>

2275
01:40:52.351 --> 01:40:53.184
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then you would raise him from the </v>

2276
01:40:54.161 --> 01:40:57.250
<v Speaker 5>time they're puppies and they'd be even </v>
<v Speaker 5>more inclined to go like that.</v>

2277
01:40:57.251 --> 01:41:01.000
<v Speaker 5>So someone find wolf puppies and raise </v>
<v Speaker 5>them so they would imprint on people and</v>

2278
01:41:01.001 --> 01:41:03.280
<v Speaker 5>be even more likely to exhibit those </v>
<v Speaker 5>behaviors.</v>

2279
01:41:04.600 --> 01:41:09.600
<v Speaker 5>Kind of heat for you hanging out with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to become a Chihuahua gay folk?</v>

2280
01:41:11.230 --> 01:41:15.140
<v Speaker 5>Mostly some Mexicans.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2281
01:41:15.160 --> 01:41:18.400
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think chihuahuas are just,</v>

2282
01:41:18.430 --> 01:41:21.430
<v Speaker 5>it's just like thousands of years of </v>
<v Speaker 5>that shit,</v>

2283
01:41:21.850 --> 01:41:24.460
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>only selecting the smaller ones,</v>

2284
01:41:24.461 --> 01:41:28.720
<v Speaker 5>only selecting the most docile,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the most diminutive features.</v>

2285
01:41:29.560 --> 01:41:31.080
<v Speaker 5>It's a good question now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2286
01:41:31.690 --> 01:41:33.550
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you get freaky with it,</v>

2287
01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:37.350
<v Speaker 5>the real argument is that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2288
01:41:37.450 --> 01:41:39.610
<v Speaker 5>it's very similar in fact to human </v>
<v Speaker 5>beings.</v>

2289
01:41:39.730 --> 01:41:40.563
<v Speaker 5>Human beings are the only animals that </v>
<v Speaker 5>vary as much in their appearance as </v>

2290
01:41:44.651 --> 01:41:47.190
<v Speaker 5>dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you had Shaquille o'neal and you've</v>

2291
01:41:47.191 --> 01:41:49.990
<v Speaker 5>got bridget the midget.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those are both humans,</v>

2292
01:41:50.350 --> 01:41:54.880
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How is bridget the midget or any or Brad</v>

2293
01:41:54.880 --> 01:41:57.010
<v Speaker 5>Williams,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how anybody who's got dwarfism,</v>

2294
01:41:57.190 --> 01:42:00.310
<v Speaker 5>how are they different than an English </v>
<v Speaker 5>bulldog?</v>

2295
01:42:02.590 --> 01:42:03.730
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2296
01:42:03.940 --> 01:42:05.380
<v Speaker 5>In a way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2297
01:42:05.381 --> 01:42:08.560
<v Speaker 5>it's some sort of a strange change in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the body.</v>

2298
01:42:08.561 --> 01:42:10.180
<v Speaker 5>And I don't mean this in any </v>
<v Speaker 5>disrespectful way,</v>

2299
01:42:10.181 --> 01:42:11.014
<v Speaker 5>I'm just trying to be completely </v>
<v Speaker 5>objective about the physical form of </v>

2300
01:42:13.121 --> 01:42:14.410
<v Speaker 5>these people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2301
01:42:14.411 --> 01:42:17.560
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying that people purposely </v>
<v Speaker 5>make dwarfs,</v>

2302
01:42:18.010 --> 01:42:21.820
<v Speaker 5>but I'm saying that the physical </v>
<v Speaker 5>characteristics that differences in,</v>

2303
01:42:21.860 --> 01:42:23.830
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>an English bulldog and a wolf,</v>

2304
01:42:24.550 --> 01:42:28.660
<v Speaker 5>and that's very like the difference in </v>
<v Speaker 5>Karl Malone and Brad Williams.</v>

2305
01:42:28.870 --> 01:42:29.703
<v Speaker 5>I mean there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those are both humans and they both </v>

2306
01:42:31.241 --> 01:42:33.250
<v Speaker 5>could pregnant in pregnant,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the same woman,</v>

2307
01:42:33.640 --> 01:42:34.473
<v Speaker 5>like if a woman had a baby with Karl </v>
<v Speaker 5>Malone and then a woman had a baby with </v>

2308
01:42:36.641 --> 01:42:38.230
<v Speaker 5>a dwarf,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like right afterwards,</v>

2309
01:42:38.500 --> 01:42:39.333
<v Speaker 5>she still mean she can get pregnant from</v>
<v Speaker 5>both of them and have a baby from both </v>

2310
01:42:42.251 --> 01:42:43.084
<v Speaker 5>of them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And potentially the same genetic </v>

2311
01:42:46.360 --> 01:42:48.480
<v Speaker 5>characteristics could be passed down </v>
<v Speaker 5>live.</v>

2312
01:42:48.500 --> 01:42:49.780
<v Speaker 5>The less likely with the dwarf.</v>

2313
01:42:49.780 --> 01:42:50.613
<v Speaker 5>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is incredible when you think about </v>

2314
01:42:51.851 --> 01:42:54.880
<v Speaker 5>the variation of human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We can get a little,</v>

2315
01:42:55.110 --> 01:42:58.720
<v Speaker 5>a tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a 90 pound Asian lady,</v>

2316
01:42:59.050 --> 01:42:59.883
<v Speaker 5>and then you can have Sabrina Williams,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this super athlete with giant muscles </v>

2317
01:43:03.491 --> 01:43:05.920
<v Speaker 5>and just ridiculous explosive ability.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2318
01:43:05.921 --> 01:43:08.740
<v Speaker 5>they're both female humans.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2319
01:43:08.741 --> 01:43:12.580
<v Speaker 5>it's sort of like a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a golden lab and a rottweiler.</v>

2320
01:43:12.670 --> 01:43:13.503
<v Speaker 5>There's a both dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they're massively different </v>

2321
01:43:15.131 --> 01:43:16.630
<v Speaker 5>characteristics.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2322
01:43:17.110 --> 01:43:17.943
<v Speaker 5>And that's why like really nutty </v>
<v Speaker 5>conspiracy people believe that human </v>

2323
01:43:21.131 --> 01:43:26.110
<v Speaker 5>beings are created by aliens and that </v>
<v Speaker 5>much in the same way that human beings,</v>

2324
01:43:26.290 --> 01:43:29.740
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>engineered dogs and change the shape and</v>

2325
01:43:29.741 --> 01:43:32.830
<v Speaker 5>selectively bred them to the point where</v>
<v Speaker 5>they became these little chihuahuas.</v>

2326
01:43:33.350 --> 01:43:35.080
<v Speaker 5>That's what aliens did with human </v>
<v Speaker 5>beings.</v>

2327
01:43:35.081 --> 01:43:35.914
<v Speaker 5>They came down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they found some chimpanzees and some </v>

2328
01:43:37.630 --> 01:43:40.690
<v Speaker 5>lower hominids and started injecting </v>
<v Speaker 5>their DNA into him.</v>

2329
01:43:40.691 --> 01:43:44.840
<v Speaker 5>And slowly but surely created a series </v>
<v Speaker 5>of different styles of,</v>

2330
01:43:44.841 --> 01:43:48.820
<v Speaker 5>of human being.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've heard this before,</v>

2331
01:43:49.470 --> 01:43:52.340
<v Speaker 5>but with the vote with the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but with the dog</v>

2332
01:43:52.670 --> 01:43:54.440
<v Speaker 1>comparison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2333
01:43:56.210 --> 01:43:57.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know man.</v>

2334
01:43:57.141 --> 01:43:58.550
<v Speaker 1>I don't know either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not,</v>

2335
01:43:58.580 --> 01:43:59.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't buy the,</v>

2336
01:43:59.700 --> 01:44:01.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alien thing.</v>

2337
01:44:01.101 --> 01:44:01.934
<v Speaker 1>I think it's much more likely it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>just different climates and different </v>

2338
01:44:05.271 --> 01:44:07.550
<v Speaker 1>parts of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were isolated from each other.</v>

2339
01:44:07.551 --> 01:44:11.380
<v Speaker 1>And so I think you think he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2340
01:44:13.160 --> 01:44:15.500
<v Speaker 1>built bread,</v>
<v Speaker 1>adapt to your situation.</v>

2341
01:44:15.680 --> 01:44:16.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

2342
01:44:17.180 --> 01:44:18.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no doubt.</v>

2343
01:44:18.350 --> 01:44:19.760
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2344
01:44:19.790 --> 01:44:20.623
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's characteristics that animals </v>

2345
01:44:21.621 --> 01:44:24.740
<v Speaker 1>exhibit that similar animals and other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2346
01:44:24.770 --> 01:44:28.460
<v Speaker 1>other climates don't like African </v>
<v Speaker 1>elephants for example.</v>

2347
01:44:28.760 --> 01:44:31.670
<v Speaker 1>They have enormous ears because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>displaces heat.</v>

2348
01:44:31.820 --> 01:44:33.980
<v Speaker 1>Large surface areas displace heat </v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

2349
01:44:34.310 --> 01:44:37.460
<v Speaker 1>It's also why a lot of African men are </v>
<v Speaker 1>very tall,</v>

2350
01:44:38.090 --> 01:44:38.923
<v Speaker 1>very tall and long because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's easier displace heat over large </v>

2351
01:44:42.201 --> 01:44:43.610
<v Speaker 1>surface area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2352
01:44:43.820 --> 01:44:44.653
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like Asian elephants of different </v>

2353
01:44:46.461 --> 01:44:49.080
<v Speaker 1>ears than African elephants do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2354
01:44:49.350 --> 01:44:52.460
<v Speaker 1>Wooly mammoths of much smaller ears </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they were dealing with cold,</v>

2355
01:44:52.461 --> 01:44:53.480
<v Speaker 1>cold climates.</v>

2356
01:44:54.110 --> 01:44:55.640
<v Speaker 1>Whereas elephants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2357
01:44:55.700 --> 01:44:56.533
<v Speaker 1>in Africa when they're in the hot </v>
<v Speaker 1>savannah's they have these giant ass </v>

2358
01:44:58.791 --> 01:45:01.040
<v Speaker 1>fucking he hears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>

2359
01:45:01.160 --> 01:45:01.993
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking from my thoughts and my </v>

2360
01:45:05.271 --> 01:45:08.030
<v Speaker 1>personal experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm definitely much better off in warmer</v>

2361
01:45:08.031 --> 01:45:12.560
<v Speaker 1>climates than I am in cold mountains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you it feel it can't do it,</v>

2362
01:45:12.561 --> 01:45:13.400
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can't do it.</v>

2363
01:45:13.490 --> 01:45:15.860
<v Speaker 1>Can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't you get used to it though?</v>

2364
01:45:16.700 --> 01:45:18.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2365
01:45:18.490 --> 01:45:19.291
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2366
01:45:19.291 --> 01:45:19.501
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2367
01:45:19.501 --> 01:45:21.080
<v Speaker 1>I just feel it in your bones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2368
01:45:21.110 --> 01:45:22.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2369
01:45:22.430 --> 01:45:24.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to get over away from this.</v>

2370
01:45:26.190 --> 01:45:27.820
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if it's hot,</v>

2371
01:45:27.821 --> 01:45:28.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2374
01:45:34.060 --> 01:45:34.880
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

2375
01:45:34.880 --> 01:45:35.940
<v Speaker 1>eh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2376
01:45:36.330 --> 01:45:39.120
<v Speaker 1>Get away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll also growing up in Austin work,</v>

2377
01:45:39.121 --> 01:45:41.220
<v Speaker 1>it's hot as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2378
01:45:41.221 --> 01:45:42.900
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

2379
01:45:42.930 --> 01:45:45.990
<v Speaker 1>I did the New York thing couldn't deal </v>
<v Speaker 1>with winters.</v>

2380
01:45:46.820 --> 01:45:49.570
<v Speaker 1>No Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2381
01:45:52.190 --> 01:45:55.060
<v Speaker 1>cause I'm thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking about all the times where I</v>

2382
01:45:55.061 --> 01:45:55.894
<v Speaker 1>busted ass and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's like walking across the street </v>

2383
01:45:59.130 --> 01:45:59.963
<v Speaker 1>and I stepped in and what I think is </v>
<v Speaker 1>snow and it's like underneath is like a </v>

2384
01:46:04.790 --> 01:46:09.350
<v Speaker 1>foot of water and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just walking around and you know,</v>

2385
01:46:09.480 --> 01:46:10.313
<v Speaker 1>I've got one wet foot and I'm supposed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be going to some fucking event or </v>

2386
01:46:13.071 --> 01:46:15.410
<v Speaker 1>something and I go to dinner or do </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

2387
01:46:15.500 --> 01:46:17.180
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

2388
01:46:17.960 --> 01:46:21.420
<v Speaker 1>I can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I can,</v>

2389
01:46:21.421 --> 01:46:22.254
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to sound like a pussy or </v>

2390
01:46:22.891 --> 01:46:23.910
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can't do it.</v>

2391
01:46:23.940 --> 01:46:25.440
<v Speaker 1>Well you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't want to.</v>

2392
01:46:25.770 --> 01:46:27.360
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to,</v>

2393
01:46:27.780 --> 01:46:30.360
<v Speaker 1>I fucking don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why should you have to?</v>

2394
01:46:30.690 --> 01:46:32.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I'm [inaudible] options.</v>

2395
01:46:32.370 --> 01:46:33.203
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if the whole world was New York </v>

2396
01:46:34.291 --> 01:46:35.220
<v Speaker 1>City,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could do it.</v>

2397
01:46:35.970 --> 01:46:38.250
<v Speaker 1>You could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely better than not living.</v>

2398
01:46:38.730 --> 01:46:39.563
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

2399
01:46:39.630 --> 01:46:41.160
<v Speaker 1>That's very true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could do it,</v>

2400
01:46:41.310 --> 01:46:43.860
<v Speaker 1>but you know that there's a better spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2401
01:46:43.980 --> 01:46:45.740
<v Speaker 1>I could adapt if I didn't know any </v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

2402
01:46:45.750 --> 01:46:48.060
<v Speaker 1>I get it down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but here you are in the best spot.</v>

2403
01:46:48.180 --> 01:46:49.860
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When comes to weather,</v>

2404
01:46:50.340 --> 01:46:52.290
<v Speaker 1>nobody can fuck with La.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

2405
01:46:53.220 --> 01:46:55.710
<v Speaker 1>That's very true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why so many of us,</v>

2406
01:46:56.310 --> 01:46:57.300
<v Speaker 1>it's what Jamie's here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at him.</v>

2407
01:46:57.510 --> 01:46:58.560
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's from Columbus,</v>

2408
01:46:58.561 --> 01:47:00.150
<v Speaker 1>Ohio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

2409
01:47:00.240 --> 01:47:01.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Columbus,</v>

2410
01:47:01.171 --> 01:47:03.840
<v Speaker 1>Ohio gives New York City that eight out </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the breaks.</v>

2411
01:47:04.380 --> 01:47:07.500
<v Speaker 1>As far as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a pool term,</v>

2412
01:47:07.501 --> 01:47:12.501
<v Speaker 1>like it's a spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a spot of your plane.</v>

2413
01:47:12.660 --> 01:47:13.493
<v Speaker 1>10 Ball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He gives some of the eight out in the </v>

2414
01:47:14.311 --> 01:47:15.990
<v Speaker 1>breaks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means if they spot,</v>

2415
01:47:16.080 --> 01:47:17.790
<v Speaker 1>if they win,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can win.</v>

2416
01:47:17.791 --> 01:47:18.624
<v Speaker 1>If they make the eight ball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nine ball or the 10 ball and they </v>

2417
01:47:21.331 --> 01:47:23.460
<v Speaker 1>could break every touching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's eight out in the breaks.</v>

2418
01:47:23.461 --> 01:47:25.980
<v Speaker 1>That's a considerable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>considerable handicap.</v>

2419
01:47:26.310 --> 01:47:27.930
<v Speaker 1>Gotcha.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say pull a little bit,</v>

2420
01:47:27.931 --> 01:47:29.340
<v Speaker 1>but I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Columbia,</v>

2421
01:47:29.400 --> 01:47:32.280
<v Speaker 1>I've been to Columbus before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got this cool little venue.</v>

2422
01:47:32.281 --> 01:47:33.840
<v Speaker 1>I played that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Columbus is great.</v>

2423
01:47:33.900 --> 01:47:35.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's nice.</v>

2424
01:47:35.970 --> 01:47:38.190
<v Speaker 1>It's a great town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're cool people.</v>

2425
01:47:38.191 --> 01:47:39.360
<v Speaker 1>They're man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a fun,</v>

2426
01:47:39.390 --> 01:47:41.850
<v Speaker 1>it's a fun town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked Columbus a lot and haven't spent</v>

2427
01:47:41.880 --> 01:47:44.730
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times now about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he definitely had a good time.</v>

2428
01:47:44.820 --> 01:47:45.653
<v Speaker 1>I haven't been there since.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shot my special there in 2009 that's </v>

2429
01:47:47.751 --> 01:47:51.420
<v Speaker 1>what Dick I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where was that in one southern theater.</v>

2430
01:47:51.840 --> 01:47:53.560
<v Speaker 1>Once that the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh that's right.</v>

2431
01:47:54.810 --> 01:47:55.950
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

2432
01:47:56.100 --> 01:47:58.830
<v Speaker 1>Jamie knows my schedule better than me </v>

2433
01:47:58.860 --> 01:48:00.150
<v Speaker 1>that's ridiculous.</v>

<v Speaker 1>how do you know this?</v>

2435
01:48:01.231 --> 01:48:04.130
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was like 2011 or 12 right?</v>

2436
01:48:04.140 --> 01:48:07.170
<v Speaker 1>To tell them 12 yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Columbus is a cool town.</v>

2437
01:48:07.320 --> 01:48:09.780
<v Speaker 1>That's like my favorite town in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Ohio.</v>

2438
01:48:11.680 --> 01:48:13.650
<v Speaker 7>Ooh.</v>

2439
01:48:13.950 --> 01:48:14.783
<v Speaker 1>Where else is there in Ohio?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like did you Cleveland Cleveland's not </v>

2440
01:48:16.891 --> 01:48:18.160
<v Speaker 1>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cleveland.</v>

2441
01:48:18.350 --> 01:48:20.730
<v Speaker 1>Cincinnati is fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Cincinnati that bullshit you,</v>

2442
01:48:21.140 --> 01:48:23.250
<v Speaker 1>he's got the Cincinnati airport in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kentucky.</v>

2443
01:48:23.640 --> 01:48:25.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

2444
01:48:25.590 --> 01:48:27.030
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's insecure.</v>

2445
01:48:27.900 --> 01:48:30.630
<v Speaker 1>The Kentucky people are insecure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They should call it the fucking Kentucky</v>

2446
01:48:30.631 --> 01:48:31.620
<v Speaker 1>airport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause that's what it is.</v>

2447
01:48:31.621 --> 01:48:32.730
<v Speaker 1>God dammit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Toledo,</v>

2448
01:48:32.731 --> 01:48:35.310
<v Speaker 1>Cincinnati assholes claim your city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

2449
01:48:35.311 --> 01:48:36.144
<v Speaker 1>but how does that even exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Cincinnati Airport is actually in </v>

2450
01:48:39.541 --> 01:48:40.374
<v Speaker 1>Kentucky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to get people to fly into Kentucky </v>

2451
01:48:42.181 --> 01:48:43.014
<v Speaker 1>is problematic because people have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have massive prejudice against </v>

2452
01:48:51.331 --> 01:48:52.170
<v Speaker 1>Kentucky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

2453
01:48:52.171 --> 01:48:55.800
<v Speaker 1>It just sounds like hillbillies were as </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cincinnati is like wk Rp,</v>

2454
01:48:56.130 --> 01:48:56.963
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a Loni Anderson and fucking </v>

2455
01:48:58.920 --> 01:49:00.500
<v Speaker 1>everybody's having a good time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2456
01:49:00.690 --> 01:49:03.450
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cincinnati sounds like a nice city,</v>

2457
01:49:03.540 --> 01:49:04.373
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's fucking right next door to </v>

2458
01:49:05.791 --> 01:49:06.624
<v Speaker 1>Kentucky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So close that you land in Kentucky and </v>

2459
01:49:09.121 --> 01:49:10.410
<v Speaker 1>then you drive to Cincinnati.</v>

2460
01:49:10.680 --> 01:49:13.680
<v Speaker 1>So they name the fucking Cincinnati </v>
<v Speaker 1>airport.</v>

2461
01:49:14.700 --> 01:49:16.860
<v Speaker 1>This Kentucky airport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty good.</v>

2462
01:49:17.010 --> 01:49:21.120
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One sneaky sneaky mother fuckers.</v>

2463
01:49:21.180 --> 01:49:24.360
<v Speaker 1>They did it for people like us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never going to go to Kentucky.</v>

2464
01:49:24.670 --> 01:49:28.610
<v Speaker 1>I fucking got me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I swore I'd never come into this buts.</v>

2465
01:49:28.640 --> 01:49:32.890
<v Speaker 1>But meanwhile there's like Louisville </v>
<v Speaker 1>where everybody goes like,</v>

2466
01:49:32.920 --> 01:49:34.630
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

01:49:36.720 --> 01:49:37.553
<v Speaker 1>See that's like everybody goes there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's one of those quaint southern </v>

2470
01:49:41.041 --> 01:49:42.540
<v Speaker 1>destinations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2471
01:49:43.470 --> 01:49:46.770
<v Speaker 1>I liked the word quaint make too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2472
01:49:46.840 --> 01:49:47.673
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spent a little bit of time running </v>

2473
01:49:49.571 --> 01:49:50.660
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're fun.</v>

01:49:56.921 --> 01:50:00.680
<v Speaker 1>And so for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's interesting for me.</v>

2477
01:50:00.750 --> 01:50:02.050
<v Speaker 1>I wonder why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder why that is.</v>

2483
01:50:11.970 --> 01:50:12.803
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I started going on the road a lot </v>

2484
01:50:14.440 --> 01:50:17.080
<v Speaker 1>in the 90s,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is when I really understood Nascar.</v>

<v Speaker 1>around in a circle?</v>

2489
01:50:25.390 --> 01:50:28.210
<v Speaker 1>And then I would see how big it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would read statistics.</v>

2492
01:50:31.091 --> 01:50:32.980
<v Speaker 1>No one's watching this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

2515
01:51:21.161 --> 01:51:23.330

2516
01:51:23.330 --> 01:51:25.540
<v Speaker 1>cultural thing that I'm just not privy </v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

2517
01:51:25.541 --> 01:51:27.220
<v Speaker 1>I just don't understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mm.</v>

2518
01:51:27.490 --> 01:51:28.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2519
01:51:29.410 --> 01:51:33.850
<v Speaker 1>we got a little bit of taste of that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Texas kind of bled over a little bit,</v>

2520
01:51:33.910 --> 01:51:36.490
<v Speaker 1>but Austin has a formula one race that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>very new.</v>

2521
01:51:36.760 --> 01:51:38.620
<v Speaker 1>But how is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how old is that?</v>

2522
01:51:38.650 --> 01:51:39.640
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>

2523
01:51:39.820 --> 01:51:41.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm new enough.</v>

2524
01:51:41.860 --> 01:51:44.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few years have passed I guess.</v>

2525
01:51:44.820 --> 01:51:46.350
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the f one,</v>

2526
01:51:47.010 --> 01:51:48.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2527
01:51:48.401 --> 01:51:50.470
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a different kind of racing.</v>

2528
01:51:50.471 --> 01:51:53.200
<v Speaker 1>And that's my style of racing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love watching Formula One cars.</v>

2529
01:51:53.201 --> 01:51:56.770
<v Speaker 1>It's turns and craziness and strategy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

2530
01:51:56.920 --> 01:52:00.040
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems like some crazy shit.</v>

2531
01:52:00.190 --> 01:52:01.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can get more into that,</v>

2532
01:52:01.451 --> 01:52:05.650
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know shit about Nascar either.</v>

2533
01:52:06.040 --> 01:52:07.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2534
01:52:07.260 --> 01:52:08.810
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2535
01:52:08.920 --> 01:52:10.770
<v Speaker 1>different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely a cultural deal.</v>

2536
01:52:10.771 --> 01:52:12.000
<v Speaker 1>I was driving through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2537
01:52:12.160 --> 01:52:12.993
<v Speaker 1>Alabama and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the south and everything and it's </v>

2538
01:52:17.730 --> 01:52:18.563
<v Speaker 1>theirs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2539
01:52:19.160 --> 01:52:20.980

<v Speaker 1>tracks and everything,</v>

2540
01:52:21.010 --> 01:52:23.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for amateurs and it's,</v>

2541
01:52:24.010 --> 01:52:25.930
<v Speaker 1>it's just like a big culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

2542
01:52:25.931 --> 01:52:28.360
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a big deal for those folks.</v>

2543
01:52:28.361 --> 01:52:29.194
<v Speaker 1>And they say that all came out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>souping up their cars for moonshine </v>

2544
01:52:31.601 --> 01:52:33.640
<v Speaker 1>runs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can believe it.</v>

2545
01:52:34.530 --> 01:52:35.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes sense.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get to get in and get out of there.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get this money,</v>

2548
01:52:38.690 --> 01:52:39.523
<v Speaker 1>get the six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which all came from the same thing that </v>

2549
01:52:42.701 --> 01:52:43.750
<v Speaker 1>we're dealing with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

2550
01:52:43.900 --> 01:52:45.740
<v Speaker 1>with psychedelics suppression.</v>

2551
01:52:46.100 --> 01:52:46.761
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2552
01:52:46.761 --> 01:52:48.710
<v Speaker 5>suppression creates diamonds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's,</v>

2553
01:52:48.711 --> 01:52:49.544
<v Speaker 5>that's what created that kind of racing </v>
<v Speaker 5>is people trying to figure out a way to </v>

2554
01:52:53.091 --> 01:52:56.600
<v Speaker 5>get the fuck away from cops.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they made cars that drove faster,</v>

2555
01:52:56.601 --> 01:52:58.820
<v Speaker 5>handled better,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they could just get away from cops.</v>

2556
01:52:58.821 --> 01:53:01.790
<v Speaker 5>And that was the whole dukes of hazard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why they had the general Lee.</v>

2557
01:53:02.330 --> 01:53:05.870
<v Speaker 5>They weren't involved in braces.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were running away from cops.</v>

2558
01:53:06.200 --> 01:53:07.860
<v Speaker 5>They had some crazy souped up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck it.</v>

2559
01:53:07.870 --> 01:53:08.703
<v Speaker 5>That's why they couldn't have guns.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They always had bows and arrows because </v>

2560
01:53:10.281 --> 01:53:12.890
<v Speaker 5>the cops had taken their,</v>
<v Speaker 5>their ability to have a firearm away.</v>

2561
01:53:13.100 --> 01:53:15.530
<v Speaker 5>When you're a felon in this country,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't own a gun anymore.</v>
