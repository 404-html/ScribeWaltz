00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:02.860
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches,</v>

2
00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.890
<v Speaker 2>Yo blackout and go to head to a bar.</v>

3
00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:07.371
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4
00:00:07.371 --> 00:00:10.130
<v Speaker 2>the problem is the titles are actually waking up in the song.</v>

5
00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:11.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.740
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

7
00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:12.110
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

8
00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:13.250
<v Speaker 2>here's the honestly what happened.</v>

9
00:00:13.251 --> 00:00:15.590
<v Speaker 2>So I went to my buddy Dave Cobb,</v>

10
00:00:15.591 --> 00:00:16.401
<v Speaker 2>he's a producer there.</v>

11
00:00:16.401 --> 00:00:18.230
<v Speaker 2>I actually met him through your buddy sturgeon.</v>

12
00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:18.980
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>

13
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:19.731
<v Speaker 2>I didn't really meet him,</v>

14
00:00:19.731 --> 00:00:20.564
<v Speaker 2>but everyone,</v>

15
00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.510
<v Speaker 2>there's a bunch of articles that said Sturge will introduce me to him.</v>

16
00:00:23.511 --> 00:00:24.690
<v Speaker 2>So I'm just going with it.</v>

17
00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:26.030
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

18
00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:27.290
<v Speaker 2>it means [inaudible] narrative.</v>

19
00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:27.801
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

20
00:00:27.801 --> 00:00:28.281
<v Speaker 2>it helps.</v>

21
00:00:28.281 --> 00:00:28.970
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

22
00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:29.803
<v Speaker 2>so uh,</v>

23
00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.690
<v Speaker 2>and I'd kind of been kicking around in Nashville for like about 15 years or so</v>

24
00:00:35.691 --> 00:00:36.890
<v Speaker 2>and with no success at all.</v>

25
00:00:36.891 --> 00:00:37.101
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

26
00:00:37.101 --> 00:00:37.934
<v Speaker 2>just bullshit.</v>

27
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:38.740
<v Speaker 2>And I'd been to,</v>

28
00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.110
<v Speaker 2>had my ass kicked my dick in the dirt as they say.</v>

29
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.960
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

30
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:43.490
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

31
00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.821
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

32
00:00:43.821 --> 00:00:44.241
<v Speaker 2>fuck it,</v>

33
00:00:44.241 --> 00:00:45.770
<v Speaker 2>this is going to be my last record.</v>

34
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:46.161
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

35
00:00:46.161 --> 00:00:47.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to whatever they call it,</v>

36
00:00:47.661 --> 00:00:51.680
<v Speaker 2>drop the Mike put out a really fucking dirty ass record though at record.</v>

37
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.140
<v Speaker 2>I was wanting to make and not pull any punches.</v>

38
00:00:54.141 --> 00:00:55.700
<v Speaker 2>I was going to just pay for my cell phone.</v>

39
00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:56.543
<v Speaker 2>It myself.</v>

40
00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.080
<v Speaker 2>And I had a feeling this was going to get me banned from Nashville and then I'd</v>

41
00:01:00.081 --> 00:01:01.790
<v Speaker 2>just leave cause I fucking broke.</v>

42
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.270
<v Speaker 2>So we made this fucking dirty record and it's probably about as dirt and it's</v>

43
00:01:09.111 --> 00:01:09.321
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

44
00:01:09.321 --> 00:01:11.570
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't even like I want to make the dirties country record.</v>

45
00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:12.404
<v Speaker 2>It was just like,</v>

46
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:14.510
<v Speaker 2>what's happened now in Nashville,</v>

47

131
00:03:24.461 --> 00:03:27.430
<v Speaker 3>I saw her in something in the news recently,</v>

132
00:03:27.431 --> 00:03:27.970
<v Speaker 3>but no,</v>

133
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:28.810
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what happened,</v>

134
00:03:28.811 --> 00:03:29.350
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

135
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:30.550
<v Speaker 3>That's a weird world.</v>

136
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.320
<v Speaker 3>She peaked that peak,</v>

137
00:03:32.321 --> 00:03:32.830
<v Speaker 3>Bro.</v>

138
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.590
<v Speaker 3>The eighties movie world is a weird world.</v>

139
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.210
<v Speaker 3>I'm surprised that people selling press pills haven't put her face on like press</v>

140
00:03:40.211 --> 00:03:41.044
<v Speaker 3>pill yet.</v>

141
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:42.250
<v Speaker 3>That would,</v>

142
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:43.450
<v Speaker 3>that would sell like wildfire.</v>

143
00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:44.373
<v Speaker 3>Anybody</v>

144
00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.800
<v Speaker 3>out there and making press pills in your bathtub,</v>

145
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.300
<v Speaker 3>monitoring wells face on them.</v>

146
00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.110
<v Speaker 3>I think the only thing that took me a while to get used to was so much MCT oil.</v>

147
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.531
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

148

<v Speaker 3>you gotta be careful with that though.</v>

149
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.450
<v Speaker 3>I text you yesterday I was running,</v>

150
00:03:56.451 --> 00:03:57.820
<v Speaker 3>Matt took this,</v>

151
00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.720
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of snow,</v>

152
00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:59.381
<v Speaker 3>MCT oil.</v>

153
00:03:59.381 --> 00:04:00.071
<v Speaker 3>I swear to God.</v>

154
00:04:00.071 --> 00:04:00.610
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

155
00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:01.443
<v Speaker 3>it's Venice.</v>

156
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:02.590
<v Speaker 3>I might as well just shit my pants,</v>

157
00:04:02.591 --> 00:04:03.340
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

158
00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:04.630
<v Speaker 3>Like no one's gonna give a fuck.</v>

159
00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:05.890
<v Speaker 3>I will just shit everywhere.</v>

160
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.670
<v Speaker 3>There's a tipping point with MCT oil where it just opens a flow.</v>

161
00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:10.523
<v Speaker 3>There's no,</v>

162
00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.450
<v Speaker 3>there's no like there's no like third gear first or fucking six care man.</v>

163
00:04:19.241 --> 00:04:20.021
<v Speaker 3>Where is it?</v>

164
00:04:20.021 --> 00:04:21.790
<v Speaker 3>Is it like two tablespoons?</v>

165
00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:22.511
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to figure it out.</v>

166
00:04:22.511 --> 00:04:23.650
<v Speaker 3>Like three tablespoons.</v>

167
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.340
<v Speaker 3>You're gone.</v>

168
00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.980
<v Speaker 3>That should is the perfect storm for explosive diarrhea.</v>

169
00:04:26.981 --> 00:04:28.300
<v Speaker 3>If you want it clean out the pipes,</v>

170
00:04:28.301 --> 00:04:29.320
<v Speaker 3>you don't need a colonic.</v>

171
00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.023
<v Speaker 3>Like God,</v>

172
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.931
<v Speaker 3>I gotta take a shit.</v>

173
00:04:31.931 --> 00:04:33.220
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's coming.</v>

174
00:04:33.221 --> 00:04:34.580
<v Speaker 3>You better fucking figure it out</v>

175
00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.850
<v Speaker 3>but up and you're tensing up your in herds.</v>

176
00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.350
<v Speaker 3>You're trying to like clamp it down to stop running.</v>

177
00:04:41.351 --> 00:04:41.860
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

178
00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.050
<v Speaker 3>I better think I pick him up.</v>

179
00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.260
<v Speaker 3>Game plan here in my mouth started watering and there's that battle that you</v>

180
00:04:47.261 --> 00:04:47.591
<v Speaker 3>play.</v>

181
00:04:47.591 --> 00:04:48.490
<v Speaker 3>It's very similar.</v>

182
00:04:48.491 --> 00:04:50.230
<v Speaker 3>The battle when you're trying not to come,</v>

183
00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:52.770
<v Speaker 3>you know the battle when you try not to come loose,</v>

184
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.150
<v Speaker 3>just squeezing it.</v>

185
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.770
<v Speaker 3>Dickish it is.</v>

186
00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:59.530
<v Speaker 3>It's very similar to that.</v>

187
00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.120
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to shit my pants.</v>

188
00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.960
<v Speaker 3>Pow.</v>

189
00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.010
<v Speaker 3>You have willpower.</v>

190
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.650
<v Speaker 3>Cause there's some weak people in the world that just shit their pants more than</v>

191
00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:06.220
<v Speaker 3>they shut.</v>

192
00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:07.490
<v Speaker 3>You can't be my friend if you,</v>

193
00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.390
<v Speaker 3>if you just give up and shit your pants loose.</v>

194
00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.843
<v Speaker 3>Fun.</v>

195
00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.590
<v Speaker 3>Keep my butt tight.</v>

196
00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.700
<v Speaker 3>You just got no will power man.</v>

197
00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.421
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

198
00:05:22.421 --> 00:05:24.250
<v Speaker 3>but then I've Shit my pants before too.</v>

199
00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.620
<v Speaker 3>It's like here's the deal.</v>

200
00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.400
<v Speaker 3>It's okay to tap out.</v>

201
00:05:30.401 --> 00:05:32.350
<v Speaker 3>Just don't tap out like a bitch.</v>

202
00:05:32.351 --> 00:05:33.410
<v Speaker 3>Not at least put up a fight.</v>

203
00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:35.080
<v Speaker 3>Going to lose the fight.</v>

204
00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.840
<v Speaker 3>Be actually in a position where you have to tap.</v>

205
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.300
<v Speaker 3>You just tap cause you're sweating and it's just,</v>

206
00:05:40.301 --> 00:05:41.420
<v Speaker 3>you have no other option.</v>

207
00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.850
<v Speaker 3>He Calvin lighty one time,</v>

208
00:05:44.851 --> 00:05:47.850
<v Speaker 3>said he shit his pants and then showed up with regular beds.</v>

209
00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:51.070
<v Speaker 3>Well that's one I just can't do.</v>

210
00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.180
<v Speaker 3>He said that he couldn't make it to the show at the ice house.</v>

211
00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.950
<v Speaker 3>I looked at the,</v>

212
00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:59.030
<v Speaker 3>because he shit his pants and I said,</v>

213
00:05:59.031 --> 00:06:00.230
<v Speaker 3>what are you talking about?</v>

214
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:00.741
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

215
00:06:00.741 --> 00:06:01.401
<v Speaker 3>I shit my pants.</v>

216
00:06:01.401 --> 00:06:02.234
<v Speaker 3>I can't come.</v>

217
00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:02.721
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

218
00:06:02.721 --> 00:06:03.470
<v Speaker 3>Brian,</v>

219
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:05.240
<v Speaker 3>these people came to see you.</v>

220
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:06.500
<v Speaker 3>They're here to see you.</v>

221
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:09.680
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

222
00:06:09.681 --> 00:06:10.251
<v Speaker 3>what should I do?</v>

223
00:06:10.251 --> 00:06:10.760
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

224
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.510
<v Speaker 3>go to a fucking bathroom at a gas station,</v>

225
00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:16.250
<v Speaker 3>take your fucking pants off,</v>

226
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:17.660
<v Speaker 3>throw them in the sink,</v>

227
00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:19.220
<v Speaker 3>clean the shit out of your pants,</v>

228
00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:20.210
<v Speaker 3>wring them out,</v>

229
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.370
<v Speaker 3>and they get over here with wet pants on and a story.</v>

230
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.050
<v Speaker 3>How old is he at this time?</v>

231
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:24.411
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

232
00:06:24.411 --> 00:06:25.244
<v Speaker 3>like a year ago.</v>

233
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:26.670
<v Speaker 3>This is years ago.</v>

234
00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:28.340
<v Speaker 3>What should I do?</v>

235
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:29.810
<v Speaker 3>You got to show up,</v>

236
00:06:29.811 --> 00:06:30.290
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

237
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:31.160
<v Speaker 3>You got to show up.</v>

238
00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:32.900
<v Speaker 3>Like people don't want to smell shit on you,</v>

239
00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:36.170
<v Speaker 3>so if you could just get to the bathroom for five minutes,</v>

240
00:06:36.171 --> 00:06:37.040
<v Speaker 3>you can fix all that.</v>

241
00:06:37.041 --> 00:06:39.410
<v Speaker 3>It's going to take a little work and you get to wear wet pants,</v>

242
00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:40.790
<v Speaker 3>but that's what you have to do.</v>

243
00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:43.580
<v Speaker 3>Duty paid paid the there.</v>

244
00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:46.160
<v Speaker 3>Brian Cowen fans I think will fuck you up,</v>

245
00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:46.490
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>

246
00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:47.271
<v Speaker 3>Hanging out your pants.</v>

247
00:06:47.271 --> 00:06:48.051
<v Speaker 3>Tell some jokes.</v>

248
00:06:48.051 --> 00:06:48.561
<v Speaker 3>So he shows up.</v>

249
00:06:48.561 --> 00:06:51.530
<v Speaker 3>10 minutes later his pants were dry and I go,</v>

250
00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:53.210
<v Speaker 3>what happened?</v>

251
00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:53.840
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>

252
00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:54.000
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

253
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.340
<v Speaker 3>I had a pair of pants in my trunk.</v>

254
00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:58.100
<v Speaker 3>The worst slide I see a pair of pants or your trunk.</v>

255
00:06:58.340 --> 00:06:59.120
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what.</v>

256
00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.310
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even want to ask what was really going on?</v>

257
00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:02.173
<v Speaker 3>Get into it.</v>

258
00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:04.490
<v Speaker 3>You Shit your pants as a grown man.</v>

259
00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:05.031
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

260
00:07:05.031 --> 00:07:06.440
<v Speaker 3>it ain't a simple procedure.</v>

261
00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.020
<v Speaker 3>There's some steps you got to me.</v>

262
00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:12.470
<v Speaker 3>That's the next next shirt is I had another pair of pants in my truck carries</v>

263
00:07:12.471 --> 00:07:13.700
<v Speaker 3>pants in the trunk.</v>

264
00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:17.390
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever had a pair of pants in your trunk and you didn't know about?</v>

265
00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:19.550
<v Speaker 3>Never Shit your pants and go.</v>

266
00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:22.220
<v Speaker 3>What is the odds that the pants are my trunk?</v>

267
00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:23.270
<v Speaker 3>Never.</v>

268
00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:24.310
<v Speaker 3>I guess when I'm older I might,</v>

269
00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.210
<v Speaker 3>I might have a baseball hat in there.</v>

270
00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:29.840
<v Speaker 3>I can cover my balls.</v>

271
00:07:29.841 --> 00:07:30.860
<v Speaker 3>I love that story.</v>

272
00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:32.150
<v Speaker 3>Kind of all the lies.</v>

273
00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:33.350
<v Speaker 3>Shitting your pants.</v>

274
00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:33.840
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

275
00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:34.673
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna need,</v>

276
00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:36.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna need to see some stuff.</v>

277
00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:38.120
<v Speaker 3>I do not know if it was a lie,</v>

278
00:07:38.121 --> 00:07:38.780
<v Speaker 3>but Goddamn,</v>

279
00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:40.130
<v Speaker 3>he smelled so normal.</v>

280
00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:41.331
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

281
00:07:41.331 --> 00:07:43.290
<v Speaker 3>I would just only calendar.</v>

282
00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:44.390
<v Speaker 3>It's the best.</v>

283
00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:45.770
<v Speaker 3>It's the only she could do that.</v>

284
00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:48.710
<v Speaker 3>There's only so much you can learn from people.</v>

285
00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:49.311
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

286
00:07:49.311 --> 00:07:50.001
<v Speaker 3>At a certain point,</v>

287
00:07:50.001 --> 00:07:53.720
<v Speaker 3>you have to understand that what makes them special is because it's stem.</v>

288
00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:54.673
<v Speaker 3>It comes out of them.</v>

289
00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:55.641
<v Speaker 3>You can't learn that.</v>

290
00:07:55.641 --> 00:07:56.474
<v Speaker 3>You can't really take it,</v>

291
00:07:56.690 --> 00:08:01.320
<v Speaker 3>but what'd you can take is the feeling of they had their own identity and you've</v>

292
00:08:01.321 --> 00:08:02.720
<v Speaker 3>got to find that in yourself.</v>

293
00:08:02.721 --> 00:08:04.670
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing that you want to ultimately get.</v>

294
00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:05.571
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

295
00:08:05.571 --> 00:08:07.160
<v Speaker 3>You want to be influenced by all these people,</v>

296
00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:10.850
<v Speaker 3>but the main influence that I think you should learn from the greats or that</v>

297
00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:11.540
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

298
00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:13.190
<v Speaker 3>you have to find it in yourself.</v>

299
00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:13.521
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

300
00:08:13.521 --> 00:08:15.110
<v Speaker 3>you can't rely on it anybody else.</v>

301
00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:15.741
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

302
00:08:15.741 --> 00:08:19.250
<v Speaker 3>And I think to see it in someone else gives you that inspiration to try to find</v>

303
00:08:19.251 --> 00:08:19.970
<v Speaker 3>it in yourself.</v>

304
00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:21.290
<v Speaker 3>So I used to search for it,</v>

305
00:08:21.291 --> 00:08:23.180
<v Speaker 3>just constantly going to be at the library,</v>

306
00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:24.830
<v Speaker 3>getting up VHS,</v>

307
00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:25.873
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

308
00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:28.910
<v Speaker 3>videos and just watching,</v>

309
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:30.890
<v Speaker 3>rewinding and watching.</v>

310
00:08:30.891 --> 00:08:35.891
<v Speaker 3>And then I would drive 19 hours from Akron to Mississippi just to like maybe</v>

311
00:08:36.171 --> 00:08:39.140
<v Speaker 3>find a musician who I heard lived in some town.</v>

312
00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:40.101
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

313
00:08:40.101 --> 00:08:42.800
<v Speaker 3>Just because I wanted to see it,</v>

314
00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:43.491
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

315
00:08:43.491 --> 00:08:43.760
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

316
00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:44.750
<v Speaker 3>and when I find,</v>

317
00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:45.613
<v Speaker 3>when I found it,</v>

318
00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.450
<v Speaker 3>this shit is life changing,</v>

319
00:08:47.451 --> 00:08:47.751
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

320
00:08:47.751 --> 00:08:48.584
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

321
00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:51.200
<v Speaker 3>I was like 17 and I went to Greenville,</v>

322
00:08:51.201 --> 00:08:51.801
<v Speaker 3>Mississippi,</v>

323
00:08:51.801 --> 00:08:54.020
<v Speaker 3>and I just started asking around for this musician named,</v>

324
00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:58.290
<v Speaker 3>his name was t model Ford and he made some really cool team model Ford.</v>

325
00:08:58.310 --> 00:08:58.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

326
00:08:58.540 --> 00:08:59.790
<v Speaker 3>He was total bad ass.</v>

327
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:01.050
<v Speaker 3>He played a death metal guitar,</v>

328
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.580
<v Speaker 3>like really a Pv.</v>

329
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:03.331
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

330
00:09:03.331 --> 00:09:05.850
<v Speaker 3>And it said with the letters who put on a mailbox,</v>

331
00:09:05.851 --> 00:09:10.440
<v Speaker 3>it's like said team motto for the Tail Dragger he had it spray painted on his</v>

332
00:09:10.441 --> 00:09:13.650
<v Speaker 3>trailer that he pulled around with his Lincoln and I,</v>

333
00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:14.130
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>

334
00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:14.761
<v Speaker 3>Just go on there.</v>

335
00:09:14.761 --> 00:09:18.270
<v Speaker 3>I would never want to just like become that person.</v>

336
00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:19.110
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

337
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:19.943
<v Speaker 3>But</v>

338
00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:25.110
<v Speaker 3>whether they're from Mississippi or they're like a classical composer from</v>

339
00:09:25.111 --> 00:09:25.944
<v Speaker 3>Germany,</v>

340
00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:29.310
<v Speaker 3>there's a thing that these all these guys have in common.</v>

341
00:09:29.311 --> 00:09:30.720
<v Speaker 3>And it's like a sense of self,</v>

342
00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:31.943
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

343
00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:33.960
<v Speaker 3>Anybody I've ever met has a real,</v>

344
00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:36.690
<v Speaker 3>just a confidence that,</v>

345
00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:37.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

346
00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:39.450
<v Speaker 3>even though they may not be the best at certain things,</v>

347
00:09:39.451 --> 00:09:41.700
<v Speaker 3>they can like bring out the best in themselves,</v>

348
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:42.061
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

349
00:09:42.061 --> 00:09:42.320
<v Speaker 3>and that,</v>

350
00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:43.170
<v Speaker 3>and that's like enough.</v>

351
00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:44.633
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what I mean?</v>

352
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:52.030
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>
