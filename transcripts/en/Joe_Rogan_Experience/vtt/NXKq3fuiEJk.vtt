1
00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:04.723
Variance,

2
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.950
<v 1>the Joe Rogan experience.</v>

3
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:20.430
<v 2>Keith Weber,</v>

4
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.480
ladies and gentlemen.

5
00:00:21.481 --> 00:00:22.620
Finally we meet.

6
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.840
I've worked out to your voice many times.

7
00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.170
Your sleek athletic body on the beach,

8
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.570
swinging kettlebells,

9
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.350
making people work out along.

10
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:31.951
And uh,

11
00:00:31.951 --> 00:00:32.910
we got you on the podcast,

12
00:00:32.911 --> 00:00:33.091
man.

13
00:00:33.091 --> 00:00:34.380
I've been talking about your videos for,

14
00:00:34.381 --> 00:00:35.250
I don't know how long,

15
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.570
I don't even know where I found it.

16
00:00:36.571 --> 00:00:40.470
I found it somewhere online and I was looking for some video to work out too and

17
00:00:40.471 --> 00:00:41.190
it's just,

18
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.600
it was so bad ass,

19
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:43.740
you know that I'd just been,

20
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.970
we started selling it on a.com became like our best selling DVD.

21
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.000
You were constantly out of stock because we were selling them out for you,

22
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:51.721
but a,

23
00:00:51.721 --> 00:00:53.100
it's fucking awesome video man.

24
00:00:53.101 --> 00:00:54.120
So it's good to have you on.

25
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.550
<v 1>Thanks for having me Joe.</v>

26
00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.710
It's amazing to be here with the book.

27
00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:58.940
You got notes and shit.

28
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.610
Well I thought I should just in case I forget something.

29
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.570
What,

30
00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:02.960
what was,

31
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.330
what would you want to bring up that you like had to write down?

32
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:06.643
Ah,

33
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.921
well,

34
00:01:06.921 --> 00:01:07.300
you know what,

35
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.790
like I thought I'd be really nervous and I thought maybe there'd be some

36
00:01:10.791 --> 00:01:12.200
important stuff I forgot about.

37
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.210
There's some parts of the video that are really hilarious that I didn't want to

38
00:01:17.211 --> 00:01:22.211
forget to mention because I've looked on the Internet about some of the comments

39
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.350
people put and most of them are actually positive than ones I've read and

40
00:01:27.351 --> 00:01:29.810
there's a few that are quite hilarious,

41
00:01:29.811 --> 00:01:32.960
especially then the most hilarious ones are obviously the negative ones.

42
00:01:32.961 --> 00:01:33.794
So,

43
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.190
um,

44
00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.341
yeah,

45
00:01:34.341 --> 00:01:35.690
if you can get the closer you can get to this thing,

46
00:01:35.691 --> 00:01:37.880
the better because it's very directional.

47
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.700
Oh yeah.

48
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.881
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

49
00:01:38.881 --> 00:01:39.460
There you go.

50
00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:40.050
Um,

51
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.321
the,

52
00:01:40.321 --> 00:01:40.621
yeah,

53
00:01:40.621 --> 00:01:42.000
you're always going to get negative comments,

54
00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:42.270
man.

55
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.811
No matter what,

56
00:01:42.811 --> 00:01:43.950
especially if it's a workout DVD,

57
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.843
this workout,

58
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:46.830
I'm not a meathead.

59
00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.450
It was shown when you can give me fit.

60
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.490
I don't like the way he works out.

61
00:01:50.491 --> 00:01:51.750
He tells me what to do.

62
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.990
I get sand in my eyes when I did his work out on the beach.

63
00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.250
The beach is a good place to work out though,

64
00:01:59.251 --> 00:02:02.550
because you get that feeling like of humbleness.

65
00:02:02.551 --> 00:02:03.031
Like you're,

66
00:02:03.031 --> 00:02:05.990
you're connected to that ocean behind you and you know,

67
00:02:05.991 --> 00:02:10.410
you also the roar of the ocean and the feeling of the sand.

68
00:02:10.411 --> 00:02:12.210
And it's a great like surface,

69
00:02:12.211 --> 00:02:14.160
like it's a super good surface to run on.

70
00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.830
You know,

71
00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.530
if I think more people live by the beach,

72
00:02:16.531 --> 00:02:17.700
we'd have a nicer,

73
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:18.630
sweeter world.

74
00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:19.743
<v 1>I agree.</v>

75
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.380
Uh,

76
00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.310
the thing that blows me away whenever we,

77
00:02:22.311 --> 00:02:26.230
we always go on holidays at least two or three times a year to a tropical place

78
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.170
because my wife and I and the kids love the beach.

79
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.100
Powerful white people.

80
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.200
Proper white privilege.

81
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.120
That's for three times a year vacation.

82
00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.460
There's a story behind that.

83
00:02:36.461 --> 00:02:38.020
But um,

84
00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.800
and when I see people running down the beach with the running shoes,

85
00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.420
I just want to tackle them and fix their feet because their feet.

86
00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.900
Yeah.

87
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:47.770
Cause feet are fixable.

88
00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.821
Um,

89
00:02:48.821 --> 00:02:50.650
what's wrong with most people in running shoes?

90
00:02:50.651 --> 00:02:51.071
Running shoes?

91
00:02:51.071 --> 00:02:51.904
Just bad for you.

92
00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.983
I,

93
00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.560
I wouldn't run a marathon without running shoes.

94
00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.050
Like that would be crazy because of the pounding.

95
00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.921
Well,

96
00:02:59.921 --> 00:03:00.221
yeah.

97
00:03:00.221 --> 00:03:01.054
You know.

98
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.750
Have you ever read the book she running or born to run?

99
00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.630
<v 2>No,</v>

100
00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.200
I've never read anything on running because there was a great comic named Bill

101
00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.030
Hicks who used to make fun of Jim Fixx,

102
00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.691
the guy who,

103
00:03:11.691 --> 00:03:11.930
uh,

104
00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:12.770
the running books.

105
00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:13.160
Right.

106
00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.671
Cause he was like,

107
00:03:13.671 --> 00:03:14.720
what are you writing about?

108
00:03:14.721 --> 00:03:15.021
Left,

109
00:03:15.021 --> 00:03:15.411
right,

110
00:03:15.411 --> 00:03:15.681
left,

111
00:03:15.681 --> 00:03:16.230
right.

112
00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.530
I could get done faster,

113
00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:19.364
faster.

114
00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.830
<v 1>I,</v>

115
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:21.470
yeah,

116
00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.950
it's amazing cause we're in Venice beach right now and a lot of people run in

117
00:03:24.951 --> 00:03:29.951
Venice beach and I totally get why runners get a bad rap sometimes because a lot

118
00:03:30.861 --> 00:03:32.000
of people are running,

119
00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:33.380
it really shouldn't be running.

120
00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:34.483
<v 2>Like in what way?</v>

121
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:35.870
They're not strong enough.

122
00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:37.940
It's just not in shape enough to be running.

123
00:03:37.941 --> 00:03:38.510
Yeah.

124
00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.720
<v 1>Again,</v>

125
00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.650
you really need to have a lot of strength to run properly and really

126
00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:44.380
<v 2>like in Wa.</v>

127
00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:45.030
And how solid.

128
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.450
If you would take someone and they were thinking about starting out a workout

129
00:03:48.451 --> 00:03:48.871
routine,

130
00:03:48.871 --> 00:03:50.250
you would not recommend just running,

131
00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.850
never,

132
00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.230
never really interesting.

133
00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:53.340
What would you recommend?

134
00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:54.493
<v 1>Uh,</v>

135
00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.820
I,

136
00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.890
I wouldn't even recommend kettlebells right off the get go.

137
00:03:57.891 --> 00:04:00.800
Unless you know what you're doing and you have a good trainer.

138
00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.990
I would recommend someone that's just fresh off the couch and they don't want to

139
00:04:05.991 --> 00:04:06.680
hurt themselves.

140
00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.530
Find somebody that can teach you how to do some compound lifting.

141
00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:10.280
Uh,

142
00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.390
learn how to do squats.

143
00:04:11.391 --> 00:04:12.080
Again,

144
00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.790
learn how to do dead lifts properly.

145
00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.170
Maybe learn how to do a pull up,

146
00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.600
maybe learn how to do a push up properly.

147
00:04:17.601 --> 00:04:18.434
Um,

148
00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.250
all those basic old school exercises are so powerful.

149
00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:23.080
<v 2>Do you want,</v>

150
00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.990
do you deal often with people that are starting from scratch?

151
00:04:25.991 --> 00:04:30.570
Because that seems to me to be a very daunting proposition for some folks who

152
00:04:30.571 --> 00:04:32.290
have been kind of couch potatoes their whole life.

153
00:04:32.291 --> 00:04:33.011
And then all of a sudden they're like,

154
00:04:33.011 --> 00:04:33.460
you know what,

155
00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.910
goddammit,

156
00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:34.743
I'm going to get fit.

157
00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.010
I really want to do something.

158
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.530
Like I have a buddy who's really big and uh,

159
00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:39.670
he's been telling me lately,

160
00:04:39.671 --> 00:04:41.410
he does a lot of shooting competitions.

161
00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:42.370
Like he does like,

162
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.680
uh,

163
00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.011
like,

164
00:04:43.011 --> 00:04:43.270
uh,

165
00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:44.350
those tactical things.

166
00:04:44.351 --> 00:04:46.210
We run through a maze and you have to shoot at targets,

167
00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.880
but he's too big and it's like God damn and I got to lose some weight.

168
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.470
But I could tell it's hard to just start doing that.

169
00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.020
It's hard to just change your lifestyle.

170
00:04:56.021 --> 00:04:57.850
We have patterns that we fall into.

171
00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.271
You know,

172
00:04:58.271 --> 00:04:59.800
you got your average everyday pattern.

173
00:04:59.801 --> 00:05:00.491
He'd get up in the morning,

174
00:05:00.491 --> 00:05:01.690
you eat some unhealthy shit,

175
00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:02.411
you go to an office,

176
00:05:02.411 --> 00:05:03.170
you sit in a cubicle,

177
00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:04.003
whatever you do.

178
00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:09.010
It's really hard to say today after work at six 30 I'm going to go and do

179
00:05:09.011 --> 00:05:13.030
jumping jacks and push ups and Chin ups and I'm gonna get my shit together.

180
00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.700
<v 1>And that,</v>

181
00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:15.191
honestly,

182
00:05:15.191 --> 00:05:17.090
that is the main impetus for the,

183
00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.610
the video in the first place.

184
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:22.090
And I come across people that I treat all the time.

185
00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:23.201
Keith,

186
00:05:23.201 --> 00:05:25.270
I want to get into shape and you know,

187
00:05:25.271 --> 00:05:25.871
how do I do it?

188
00:05:25.871 --> 00:05:27.710
And that's what I do love about the kettlebells.

189
00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:28.840
Like in a perfect world,

190
00:05:28.841 --> 00:05:31.300
I would have them learn how to do the compound lifts slowly.

191
00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:33.760
But the kettlebells provide the same idea,

192
00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.500
same movement patterns without having to put a bunch of weight onto your body.

193
00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:42.550
It's amazing that inertia and the momentum created by these things.

194
00:05:42.551 --> 00:05:43.384
So,

195
00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:44.373
um,

196
00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:44.741
yeah,

197
00:05:44.741 --> 00:05:45.574
it's uh,

198
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:50.470
so I do get a lot of people in my kettlebell classes that are starting fresh,

199
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:51.470
like amazing.

200
00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:52.090
Like,

201
00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:52.923
um,

202
00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.130
the women that come,

203
00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:55.060
usually it's women.

204
00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.220
I don't know why it's a guys

205
00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.110
<v 3>don't like to go out of that comfort zone.</v>

206
00:06:00.111 --> 00:06:01.760
Maybe you think that's what it is.

207
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:02.330
Well,

208
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.660
maybe just a handsome guy with long blonde hair and chicks are looking to hookup

209
00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:08.270
weapons.

210
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:12.680
A pitch can get them to teach me how to work out and work my way into his life.

211
00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:14.121
No,

212
00:06:14.121 --> 00:06:15.140
I don't think that's what I don't think.

213
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.930
I honestly think women have a different mentality.

214
00:06:17.931 --> 00:06:22.070
I have a buddy I run hills with just a couple blocks from our house is a perfect

215
00:06:22.071 --> 00:06:22.550
heel.

216
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:23.600
If you bust your ass,

217
00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:24.770
it'll take you about two hours,

218
00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:25.723
two minutes,

219
00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:27.250
20 seconds to get to the top.

220
00:06:27.251 --> 00:06:29.400
Like that's absolutely giving it everything you have.

221
00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:30.980
So it's kind of the perfect length of a hill.

222
00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:34.130
Kind of taps into that mid range energy system.

223
00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:37.220
And there's mornings every morning,

224
00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:40.940
the summer there's a group of women at this playground nearby.

225
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.260
It's 6:00 AM like 20 of them doing bootcamps and,

226
00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.670
and pushups and burpees and things like that.

227
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:48.470
You'd never see 20 guys doing that.

228
00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.030
At least I haven't.

229
00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.590
You would if they were in the military.

230
00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:52.600
Good point.

231
00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:53.260
We probably,

232
00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:54.093
uh,

233
00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.680
like just on their own will and desire to be in good shape.

234
00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:58.760
Most guys,

235
00:06:58.761 --> 00:07:00.350
unless they're professional athletes,

236
00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:03.310
if they're just the average guy that wants to look good and you know,

237
00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:05.930
be like that guy in the fitness magazine,

238
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:07.783
they uh,

239
00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:11.450
they don't like being in public almost.

240
00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:12.231
Oh,

241
00:07:12.231 --> 00:07:13.064
I see what you're saying.

242
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:15.140
Like women don't mind working on at a park,

243
00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.830
like getting all together and yeah,

244
00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:17.683
they doing that.

245
00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:19.630
It's more than my finger.

246
00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:20.930
They're a bit more social than us,

247
00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:21.950
a little more social.

248
00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:23.113
So,

249
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:23.720
um,

250
00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.700
goes back to the hunter gatherer thing or something.

251
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.560
It probably sat around and talked with the hunters are all being really quiet,

252
00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:31.790
sneaking up on shit.

253
00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:32.720
I've heard that,

254
00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:33.160
but I don't,

255
00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:33.921
I don't know if it's true,

256
00:07:33.921 --> 00:07:35.080
but yeah,

257
00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:37.160
they talk a little bit about that in the book.

258
00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.960
Born to run is an honor,

259
00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:39.740
honor.

260
00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:42.380
I recommend that book to everybody because it's a,

261
00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:47.980
it will make you want to try running and running on the beach should be done

262
00:07:48.141 --> 00:07:48.710
barefoot.

263
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:49.543
I believe so,

264
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:50.180
yeah.

265
00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:52.440
That's the way you were all supposed to run anyway.

266
00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:52.641
Right.

267
00:07:52.641 --> 00:07:56.270
We're not supposed to run the way most people think because of those running

268
00:07:56.271 --> 00:07:58.610
shoes that you're supposed to go heal first.

269
00:07:58.640 --> 00:07:59.180
Right.

270
00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:02.870
Because they've sort of changed people's gates with these shoes,

271
00:08:02.871 --> 00:08:05.210
with his big fat pad near the heel,

272
00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:07.310
which is really unnatural.

273
00:08:07.311 --> 00:08:07.731
Correct.

274
00:08:07.731 --> 00:08:09.410
Like the way the foot is designed,

275
00:08:09.411 --> 00:08:11.720
you're supposed to land on the ball of the foot and the foot is actually

276
00:08:11.721 --> 00:08:14.450
supposed to act as a bit of a shock absorber,

277
00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:17.090
just slowly decelerate your weight.

278
00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:21.590
And that is how a natural gait is supposed to be performed when you're running.

279
00:08:21.591 --> 00:08:21.980
Right?

280
00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:22.370
Yeah.

281
00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:23.203
Um,

282
00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:24.770
and there's actually,

283
00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:28.820
there have been studies done where they've taken people and they blindfolded him

284
00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:33.230
and looked at their gait patterns and then they put these big runners on and

285
00:08:33.231 --> 00:08:34.760
they have a very similar gait pattern.

286
00:08:34.761 --> 00:08:37.260
It's almost like you take away that sensory ability of the,

287
00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:40.850
all those thousands of nerve endings in the ballroom of the foot to actually

288
00:08:40.851 --> 00:08:41.631
feel what's going on.

289
00:08:41.631 --> 00:08:44.270
So your body subconsciously puts the brakes on,

290
00:08:44.271 --> 00:08:45.390
it makes you heel strike

291
00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:50.030
the heel strike thing really didn't happen until,

292
00:08:50.031 --> 00:08:52.550
what it was like the 1970s or something like that when they came up with those

293
00:08:52.551 --> 00:08:53.384
running shoes.

294
00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:54.580
He's an amazing that they,

295
00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:56.350
they virtually change

296
00:08:56.350 --> 00:09:00.000
<v 2>the entire country or really all over the world.</v>

297
00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:03.870
The gate of people when they run by putting a big fat pad on the heel,

298
00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:05.580
like we never had that before.

299
00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:06.030
<v 1>No.</v>

300
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:06.790
And it's a,

301
00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:07.241
it does,

302
00:09:07.241 --> 00:09:09.520
it creates a terribly unnatural gate.

303
00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:10.630
Um,

304
00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:12.130
and it leads to a lot of injuries.

305
00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:13.023
But

306
00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:17.290
there are a lot of people that even if they started running in a perfect

307
00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.510
scenario with the right shoes and everything,

308
00:09:19.511 --> 00:09:20.650
if they're not strong enough,

309
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:21.490
uh,

310
00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:21.850
there,

311
00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:22.540
it's going to lead it

312
00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:23.373
<v 2>to some problems.</v>

313
00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:26.120
There really is important and it's one of the things that I always stress when I

314
00:09:26.121 --> 00:09:30.770
talk to people about the onnit.com products that we sell the kettle bells or the

315
00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:32.450
like the steel clubs,

316
00:09:32.451 --> 00:09:33.231
things along those lines.

317
00:09:33.231 --> 00:09:33.471
I'm like,

318
00:09:33.471 --> 00:09:35.270
please just start slowly.

319
00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.790
Men Don't want to pick up an 18 pound kettlebell.

320
00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:39.260
Blackboard Fulcan Birch,

321
00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:40.520
I could work over more,

322
00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:41.630
but you're very,

323
00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:45.050
your video with a 35 pound kettle bell kicks my ass.

324
00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:46.370
Just 35 pounds.

325
00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:47.600
You think that's not that big?

326
00:09:47.601 --> 00:09:49.160
It's like a four year old,

327
00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:49.790
you know?

328
00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:50.270
Yeah.

329
00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:50.361
Well,

330
00:09:50.361 --> 00:09:50.571
yeah,

331
00:09:50.571 --> 00:09:51.860
if you can carry it for women,

332
00:09:51.861 --> 00:09:53.120
carry four year olds in their arm,

333
00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:53.331
you know,

334
00:09:53.331 --> 00:09:54.920
my wife's carries our four year old all the time.

335
00:09:54.921 --> 00:09:55.910
She's about 35 pounds.

336
00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:56.331
I mean,

337
00:09:56.331 --> 00:09:57.200
that's all that is.

338
00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:57.890
And you're,

339
00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:00.710
you're doing this workout and it's the beginning.

340
00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:01.191
It seems like,

341
00:10:01.191 --> 00:10:01.371
wow,

342
00:10:01.371 --> 00:10:02.240
this is not that hard.

343
00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:04.130
But then a minute in you're like,

344
00:10:04.131 --> 00:10:05.030
Holy Shit,

345
00:10:05.031 --> 00:10:06.110
how long is this going to be?

346
00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:10.370
And then you realize that just one kettle bell,

347
00:10:10.371 --> 00:10:12.810
just one simple 35 pound kettlebell.

348
00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:13.970
If you follow your workout,

349
00:10:13.971 --> 00:10:16.660
you can get an absolutely brutal routine in.

350
00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:17.540
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

351
00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:18.373
it's a,

352
00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:19.580
and it's kind of,

353
00:10:19.581 --> 00:10:20.414
um,

354
00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:22.580
for me it's a measuring stick.

355
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.030
I like to use my video at least once a month to test myself,

356
00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:30.410
make sure I'm not getting lazy or kind of starting to fall off the rails because

357
00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:32.120
I'm just like everyone else.

358
00:10:32.121 --> 00:10:33.320
If I don't stay with it,

359
00:10:33.321 --> 00:10:34.154
I can get,

360
00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:35.200
you know,

361
00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:35.990
a little bit lazy.

362
00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:36.321
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

363
00:10:36.321 --> 00:10:38.300
Everybody can if they don't have some sort of a goal.

364
00:10:38.301 --> 00:10:38.660
Right?

365
00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:39.020
Yup.

366
00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:41.930
That's one of the cool things about your video is just you have to keep up with

367
00:10:41.931 --> 00:10:42.330
it.

368
00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:45.290
Like I bought a bunch of videos before they were excellent.

369
00:10:45.291 --> 00:10:49.300
Like Maxwell has a bunch of videos and a Mike Mauler has a bunch of videos.

370
00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:53.300
Mike Mauer is very much into technique and yet in showing the fundamentals of

371
00:10:53.301 --> 00:10:54.710
the movements and things along those lines.

372
00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:57.130
But what I really liked about yours is just a,

373
00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:01.340
you have to already know that shit and it's just hardcore ready go,

374
00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:02.203
let's do this.

375
00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:03.533
<v 1>And that.</v>

376
00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:06.850
That was the big thing when I first started doing kettle bells.

377
00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:07.980
I think in o two,

378
00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:12.030
I think I took their for their second instructors course with dragon door.

379
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:13.463
Um,

380
00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:14.341
yeah,

381
00:11:14.341 --> 00:11:17.850
there weren't any videos out there that just for people that knew what they were

382
00:11:17.851 --> 00:11:18.330
doing.

383
00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:19.680
And so I had,

384
00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:22.500
I bought every video in the book and I shouldn't say that there were a couple

385
00:11:22.501 --> 00:11:23.334
that were,

386
00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:23.940
uh,

387
00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:25.110
for people that knew what they were doing,

388
00:11:25.111 --> 00:11:25.944
but they were,

389
00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:28.740
I just don't think they wanted to hurt anybody.

390
00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:29.310
Right.

391
00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:30.690
And I had seen,

392
00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:33.990
I'd been teaching kettle bells by the time I made that first video for at least

393
00:11:33.991 --> 00:11:34.824
three years.

394
00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:36.000
And I'd seen what these ha,

395
00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:36.720
again,

396
00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:39.960
mostly women housewives that were coming fresh off,

397
00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:44.040
not exercising and what they were putting themselves through and they weren't

398
00:11:44.041 --> 00:11:44.551
getting hurt.

399
00:11:44.551 --> 00:11:45.930
They were just getting really good shape.

400
00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:47.880
And so I thought,

401
00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:51.000
I'm going to put a video together like we do in class.

402
00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:53.160
And I did have a lot of requests from people saying,

403
00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:54.220
make a video.

404
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:55.300
<v 3>I can't make it to your class.</v>

405
00:11:55.301 --> 00:11:57.970
I'd love to have something to just pop into the DVD player at home.

406
00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:01.720
It'd be awesome if there was something like a class or something,

407
00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:06.400
like a really common class that was taught were people that had never worked out

408
00:12:06.401 --> 00:12:06.711
before.

409
00:12:06.711 --> 00:12:09.250
It could all get together so they didn't feel like freaks.

410
00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:09.610
Yeah.

411
00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:10.211
You know what I mean?

412
00:12:10.211 --> 00:12:14.770
So you don't like show up at the gym and these all these fucking Bros all

413
00:12:14.771 --> 00:12:19.771
stuffed it up and screaming and throwing weights around and dropping them after

414
00:12:20.021 --> 00:12:21.670
they lift and it's very intimidating.

415
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.630
There's a place you could go for folks who are just cubicle jockeys.

416
00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:26.680
You know what have you.

417
00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:27.341
People that are like,

418
00:12:27.341 --> 00:12:27.940
you know what?

419
00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:29.620
I just need something different.

420
00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:30.640
This is it.

421
00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:30.941
I'm going to,

422
00:12:30.941 --> 00:12:32.800
I'm going to take this class and my workout for the first time,

423
00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:33.570
like a war,

424
00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:35.470
a first timer workout program.

425
00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:36.333
That would be awesome.

426
00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:39.700
And I think honestly kettlebells give you that.

427
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.170
That's the closest thing you could ever get to something for everybody because

428
00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:44.800
it's,

429
00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:47.230
it's a lightweight and it's uh,

430
00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:49.560
it's such an equal stress on the body.

431
00:12:49.561 --> 00:12:49.621
Like,

432
00:12:49.621 --> 00:12:49.841
you know,

433
00:12:49.841 --> 00:12:51.430
like you go to the gym,

434
00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:52.060
they'll,

435
00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:54.720
you'll do bench press and arms and the next day he can't move your,

436
00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:56.380
your pecs and arms are just fried.

437
00:12:56.381 --> 00:12:57.214
Where's the Kettlebell?

438
00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:58.750
Your whole body is fried,

439
00:12:58.751 --> 00:13:02.440
but not to the extent you can't move as long as you're sensible about it.

440
00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:04.300
So and moving it all together.

441
00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:04.591
Oh,

442
00:13:04.591 --> 00:13:05.290
there's one,

443
00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:06.123
one move,

444
00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:07.630
one unit rather.

445
00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:08.220
Yeah.

446
00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:11.630
I always find it that it translates the best to actual athletics too.

447
00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:16.690
Then when you do things like deadlifts or squats or any big compound movement,

448
00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:17.260
it just,

449
00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:21.010
it translates like you actually feel physically stronger when you do something

450
00:13:21.011 --> 00:13:23.980
like martial arts or grappling things along those lines.

451
00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:27.980
I think that has a lot to do with the acceleration to like that's the goal.

452
00:13:27.981 --> 00:13:29.500
It's like exercise.

453
00:13:29.501 --> 00:13:32.020
I love to throw an exercise I love to hate.

454
00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:32.913
It's a,

455
00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:37.030
because you have to develop a lot of acceleration to get that Kettlebell over

456
00:13:37.031 --> 00:13:37.780
your head,

457
00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:38.920
especially when you're getting tired.

458
00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:41.980
That's why I like to put the thrusters after you've kind of done a couple of

459
00:13:41.981 --> 00:13:43.540
exercises to fry the legs and shoulders.

460
00:13:43.541 --> 00:13:44.920
I think the man maker,

461
00:13:44.921 --> 00:13:45.880
I think it's a,

462
00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:48.460
I think it starts out with,

463
00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:50.200
it actually starts out with a thruster.

464
00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:51.010
Um,

465
00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:53.380
but a lot of the other chapters there's,

466
00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:54.281
I sent it,

467
00:13:54.281 --> 00:13:57.490
slide it in there when you're really fatigued and it forces you to get that

468
00:13:57.491 --> 00:14:00.160
acceleration and then that translates over to the strength.

469
00:14:00.161 --> 00:14:02.470
So did you ever work one on one with a,

470
00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:03.760
any MMA athletes?

471
00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:05.043
Um,

472
00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:05.890
I did,

473
00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:06.820
like we were talking about,

474
00:14:06.821 --> 00:14:08.490
I did work a little bit with Jason.

475
00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:10.060
Jason McDonald.

476
00:14:10.061 --> 00:14:10.300
Yeah.

477
00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:11.440
We're talking about before the show.

478
00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:12.670
And uh,

479
00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:14.020
and we did,

480
00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:14.950
we went for,

481
00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:16.900
I'm not sure how many workloads,

482
00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:18.820
at least half a dozen because he's,

483
00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:19.780
he trains,

484
00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:21.040
he was training,

485
00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:21.550
uh,

486
00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:22.480
like twice a day.

487
00:14:22.481 --> 00:14:27.460
So these were just sort of to supplement his training and uh,

488
00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:30.640
but I think it was a little much with everything else he was doing.

489
00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:31.720
So,

490
00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:32.980
but I think he won his next fight,

491
00:14:32.981 --> 00:14:33.814
so maybe it helped.

492
00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:36.250
That is a big issue with MMA fighters.

493
00:14:36.251 --> 00:14:38.320
It's like doing just the right amount,

494
00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:41.200
like you don't want to do too much so that you're burnt out when it comes to

495
00:14:41.201 --> 00:14:42.910
your skill training later on the night.

496
00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:45.280
Like when it comes to like technique,

497
00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:46.210
martial arts technique.

498
00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:50.230
But a lot of guys do like to do their strength and conditioning first to wear

499
00:14:50.231 --> 00:14:52.040
themselves out so that when they

500
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.090
<v 2>do their sparring,</v>

501
00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:56.090
they try to be more technical because they've already exhausted and they can't

502
00:14:56.091 --> 00:14:56.840
use strength.

503
00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:58.550
There's like two schools of thought when it comes to that.

504
00:14:58.551 --> 00:15:03.551
Right now there's one school of thought that says you should roll really tired.

505
00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:06.870
And then there's another school of thought says you should do all of the

506
00:15:06.871 --> 00:15:09.130
strength and conditioning after you've done all your technique works.

507
00:15:09.131 --> 00:15:13.220
So your technique could be like a sharp as a razor and then after you could

508
00:15:13.221 --> 00:15:15.110
worry about getting sloppy when you're running up hills.

509
00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:15.920
Yeah.

510
00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:16.160
<v 1>You know,</v>

511
00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:17.400
and that's really a,

512
00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:21.440
it carries over almost to the strength training world as well.

513
00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:22.191
Specifically,

514
00:15:22.191 --> 00:15:22.641
I'm like,

515
00:15:22.641 --> 00:15:23.320
I know,

516
00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:23.640
uh,

517
00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:24.770
Paul [inaudible],

518
00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:27.410
he's very much into strength with kettlebells.

519
00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.510
He's one of the guys that brought kettlebells to America,

520
00:15:29.511 --> 00:15:29.990
right?

521
00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:30.380
Yeah,

522
00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:35.180
I think he was teamed up with John Mccain and they sort of collaborated and,

523
00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:35.600
uh,

524
00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:36.890
I think the story goes,

525
00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:38.143
um,

526
00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:43.270
John said he would publish a book for Pavle if he would sort of bring

527
00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:44.930
kettlebells to American,

528
00:15:44.931 --> 00:15:46.130
let him manufacture them.

529
00:15:46.810 --> 00:15:50.330
And it must've been like late nineties.

530
00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:51.820
And before that,

531
00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:53.150
no kettle bells in America.

532
00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:54.200
I think there were,

533
00:15:54.201 --> 00:15:54.801
I think there were,

534
00:15:54.801 --> 00:15:55.940
but a few,

535
00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:57.890
I don't think it was mainstream.

536
00:15:57.960 --> 00:15:58.270
I mean,

537
00:15:58.270 --> 00:15:59.103
I don't think,

538
00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:02.600
I think it was one of those things that probably sat at the back of a gym and

539
00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:05.340
hadn't been touched in 20 years because no one knew what to do.

540
00:16:05.341 --> 00:16:05.700
Okay.

541
00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:06.320
<v 2>Right.</v>

542
00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:10.590
And then amazing as something could be around in Russia for so long and didn't

543
00:16:10.591 --> 00:16:11.341
make it to America.

544
00:16:11.341 --> 00:16:12.174
The nineties.

545
00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:13.730
<v 1>That's so weird.</v>

546
00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:14.623
Yeah.

547
00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:14.931
Yeah.

548
00:16:14.931 --> 00:16:15.261
It's,

549
00:16:15.261 --> 00:16:16.094
uh,

550
00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:16.850
well,

551
00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:17.330
yeah.

552
00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:17.750
The,

553
00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:19.580
and when they first came out with Kettlebells,

554
00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:20.930
they had 16,

555
00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:23.510
24 and 32 kilograms sizes.

556
00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:24.403
That's it.

557
00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:26.990
And I came across kettlebells.

558
00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:28.100
Um,

559
00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:30.800
actually Pavle would put articles in the odd,

560
00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:33.770
I don't know if you remember the magazine Muscle Media 2000,

561
00:16:33.771 --> 00:16:34.604
but no,

562
00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:35.451
it was a,

563
00:16:35.451 --> 00:16:39.130
a Bill Phillips published that one and he was the guy that first came out with a

564
00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:44.030
the 30 or the 12 week body transformation challenge and you could win a car.

565
00:16:44.031 --> 00:16:47.080
And it was through eas supplements and it,

566
00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:48.133
anyway,

567
00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:49.820
I was in terrible shape.

568
00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:50.390
Uh,

569
00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:52.640
my son was just born,

570
00:16:52.641 --> 00:16:57.020
so I want to hang out at home with him and didn't go to the gym for like eight

571
00:16:57.021 --> 00:16:58.010
months at all.

572
00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:03.140
Maybe once a week I'd go and I'd felt more and more pathetic every time I'd go.

573
00:17:03.141 --> 00:17:03.950
It was horrible.

574
00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:04.760
Um,

575
00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:06.080
my son has a theory about that,

576
00:17:06.081 --> 00:17:06.914
but uh,

577
00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:11.960
so I was in really rough shape and I remember people that knew me were saying,

578
00:17:11.961 --> 00:17:12.794
hey man,

579
00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:15.110
you should do this body transformation challenge.

580
00:17:15.111 --> 00:17:15.891
And in my mind,

581
00:17:15.891 --> 00:17:17.600
I was still in awesome shape.

582
00:17:17.601 --> 00:17:18.200
I mean,

583
00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:19.033
oh yeah,

584
00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:19.611
good idea.

585
00:17:19.611 --> 00:17:19.851
You know,

586
00:17:19.851 --> 00:17:20.121
I think,

587
00:17:20.121 --> 00:17:21.410
why was everyone telling me this?

588
00:17:21.411 --> 00:17:25.130
But the key to that program was you're supposed to take a before picture.

589
00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:29.030
And I remember my wife took it before a picture of me in the middle of winter,

590
00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:29.360
you know,

591
00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:32.420
didn't have UV light for four months at least.

592
00:17:32.421 --> 00:17:33.254
And uh,

593
00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:34.340
I looked horrible.

594
00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:34.981
I actually,

595
00:17:34.981 --> 00:17:35.590
uh,

596
00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:36.423
you saved it.

597
00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:36.981
I saved it.

598
00:17:36.981 --> 00:17:37.131
Yeah.

599
00:17:37.131 --> 00:17:40.900
I actually carried around on my phone just to let you know how far you've come.

600
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:41.280
Well,

601
00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:44.480
and just even to remind me to stay disciplined.

602
00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:45.120
Right.

603
00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:46.370
Cause like I said,

604
00:17:46.371 --> 00:17:48.080
I'm a just like everyone else,

605
00:17:48.081 --> 00:17:48.914
like I,

606
00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:50.100
I can fall off

607
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:51.030
<v 3>the wagon pretty easily.</v>

608
00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:51.690
But uh,

609
00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:53.130
so you took this before picture.

610
00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:53.430
Yeah.

611
00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:54.810
And then you did the challenge.

612
00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:55.260
Yup.

613
00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:56.700
And then I fell,

614
00:17:57.060 --> 00:18:01.350
I fell in love with the whole Bill Phillips Muscle media concept and read every

615
00:18:01.351 --> 00:18:02.610
magazine cover to cover.

616
00:18:02.611 --> 00:18:05.880
And I sent my pictures into muscle media and,

617
00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:06.930
uh,

618
00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:07.770
I didn't win anything.

619
00:18:07.771 --> 00:18:08.370
I might have one,

620
00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:10.490
a sports bag or something like that,

621
00:18:10.491 --> 00:18:11.324
but,

622
00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:12.611
but the,

623
00:18:12.611 --> 00:18:16.170
the after pictures were quite astounding,

624
00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:17.400
comparatively.

625
00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:18.240
And I will admit,

626
00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:19.051
uh,

627
00:18:19.051 --> 00:18:19.321
you know,

628
00:18:19.321 --> 00:18:23.710
I had a bit of a Tan and I maybe got a haircut and you yourself up a little bit,

629
00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:27.600
but not to the point where a lot of people I knew that were doing the challenge

630
00:18:27.601 --> 00:18:29.530
did cause I think that's just a,

631
00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:32.520
so not genuine like to like there was one guy,

632
00:18:32.521 --> 00:18:34.660
he was dehydrating himself for three days.

633
00:18:34.661 --> 00:18:37.200
So we look more ripped and you know what I mean?

634
00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.940
And there's another guy that uh,

635
00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:39.931
uh,

636
00:18:39.931 --> 00:18:40.560
you know,

637
00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:45.240
was taking like loads of creatine so he could get pumped up a little bit more.

638
00:18:45.241 --> 00:18:48.140
And like that's one of the things that everybody used to love about fade,

639
00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:49.470
fade or million ankle.

640
00:18:49.471 --> 00:18:50.970
The former uh,

641
00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:54.900
pride champion and one of the greatest mixed martial artists ever is that he was

642
00:18:54.901 --> 00:18:56.160
always kind of dumpy.

643
00:18:56.530 --> 00:18:57.870
He had like a little gut,

644
00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:00.660
like a little spare time and you always like thick,

645
00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:00.961
big,

646
00:19:00.961 --> 00:19:01.950
thick Russian dude,

647
00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:03.150
but you know,

648
00:19:03.151 --> 00:19:04.590
never worried about what he looked like.

649
00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:05.883
He was just fit.

650
00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:07.980
And he was always in great shape too,

651
00:19:07.981 --> 00:19:09.690
which is really kind of astounding.

652
00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:11.430
Like the gun never gassed out.

653
00:19:11.431 --> 00:19:11.581
I mean,

654
00:19:11.581 --> 00:19:13.650
he was always an excellent shape and you know,

655
00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:16.140
never had a six pack and it's fucking life.

656
00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:18.090
Not one time where he's fighting at least.

657
00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:18.810
Yeah.

658
00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:21.780
Well that's one thing with the sport I'm sort of doing now,

659
00:19:21.781 --> 00:19:22.561
at least in the summer,

660
00:19:22.561 --> 00:19:23.760
our summers are really short,

661
00:19:23.761 --> 00:19:26.830
so I think that's why I like try IFD triathlon now you're,

662
00:19:26.831 --> 00:19:27.130
you're,

663
00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:27.963
you live in Alberta?

664
00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:28.621
In Alberta,

665
00:19:28.621 --> 00:19:28.871
yeah.

666
00:19:28.871 --> 00:19:30.900
It's that summer like is like a week long.

667
00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:33.030
Very short summer.

668
00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:33.391
Yeah.

669
00:19:33.391 --> 00:19:34.140
It's a,

670
00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:37.080
and what we do get is oftentimes not so great.

671
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:38.280
It's so beautiful up there though,

672
00:19:38.281 --> 00:19:38.590
man.

673
00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:39.090
Yes.

674
00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:39.870
Oh God.

675
00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:40.890
I was up there in June.

676
00:19:40.891 --> 00:19:41.724
It's amazing.

677
00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:42.750
It's so gorgeous.

678
00:19:42.751 --> 00:19:45.420
So much trees and animal life and everything up there.

679
00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:45.661
Yeah,

680
00:19:45.661 --> 00:19:46.560
it's very natural.

681
00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:47.680
It's a,

682
00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:48.513
yeah.

683
00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:49.051
So anyway,

684
00:19:49.051 --> 00:19:49.884
you were saying,

685
00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:50.700
uh,

686
00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:51.540
your winter times,

687
00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:53.010
summers are very short.

688
00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:56.280
Some are short and never judge a book by its cover.

689
00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:57.300
That's where I was going with that.

690
00:19:57.330 --> 00:20:01.530
Like you'll have people doing these triathlons that you're there in front of you

691
00:20:01.531 --> 00:20:04.860
for most of the race and they're huge and they're there.

692
00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:09.720
They don't have the typical athlete body type at all and they're just like thick

693
00:20:09.721 --> 00:20:10.051
guys.

694
00:20:10.051 --> 00:20:11.790
It should be playing rugby or something like that.

695
00:20:11.791 --> 00:20:12.380
And they're,

696
00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:13.290
they're still fast.

697
00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:17.610
So they must have a powerful engine under their tongue to cart that carcass

698
00:20:17.611 --> 00:20:22.611
around that's 50 pounds heavier than me or then also probably heavier than it

699
00:20:23.281 --> 00:20:24.000
should be.

700
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:24.330
Oh yeah.

701
00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:24.720
Right.

702
00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:24.931
I mean,

703
00:20:24.931 --> 00:20:27.300
there's a lot of people out there that are in really good shape,

704
00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:28.163
but they're fat.

705
00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:29.220
You know,

706
00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:29.431
like,

707
00:20:29.431 --> 00:20:30.091
I know this dude,

708
00:20:30.091 --> 00:20:30.871
I want to say his name,

709
00:20:30.871 --> 00:20:32.670
but he's a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt.

710
00:20:32.671 --> 00:20:33.990
He's had a big fat belly,

711
00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:35.820
but the fucking guy doesn't get tired.

712
00:20:35.821 --> 00:20:36.450
Man.

713
00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:37.051
Your role with them,

714
00:20:37.051 --> 00:20:39.870
he knows how to conserve energy and he's under that belly.

715
00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:41.250
He's strong as shit,

716
00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:44.850
like his core and his legs and everything's very physically strong,

717
00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:48.760
but he's just got a lot of fucking pizza and his body.

718
00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:50.651
Yeah,

719
00:20:50.651 --> 00:20:51.070
that's true.

720
00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:51.903
That's a,

721
00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:53.440
I was thinking about that the other day.

722
00:20:53.441 --> 00:20:54.274
Why?

723
00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:58.090
Because people ask me a lot about what I eat and I don't think I eat

724
00:20:58.091 --> 00:21:00.010
particularly crazy,

725
00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:00.970
uh,

726
00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:05.080
in terms of disciplined until I hang out with someone that I always wonder

727
00:21:05.081 --> 00:21:05.290
about.

728
00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:05.501
Like,

729
00:21:05.501 --> 00:21:06.110
uh,

730
00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:07.270
and I won't say any names here,

731
00:21:07.271 --> 00:21:09.400
but there's a couple of buddies I have that there,

732
00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:10.060
you know,

733
00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:11.200
they do triathlons,

734
00:21:11.201 --> 00:21:12.340
they're working out all the time,

735
00:21:12.341 --> 00:21:13.174
they're doing stuff,

736
00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:14.470
but they got a little bit extra.

737
00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:19.180
And so all I need to do is go for a bike ride with them.

738
00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:22.900
We're going to go for a two or three hour long bike ride to find out why.

739
00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:25.120
And during these bike rides,

740
00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:29.470
these guys will consume like I'm not even hungry and we're in a one hour of the

741
00:21:29.471 --> 00:21:29.711
ride.

742
00:21:29.711 --> 00:21:30.730
I'm just starting to warm up.

743
00:21:31.150 --> 00:21:31.990
And these guys are,

744
00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:34.600
they've already chowed down an energy bar.

745
00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:39.590
They're drinking this sugary Cytomax or whatever type solution without

746
00:21:39.591 --> 00:21:40.630
electrolytes in it.

747
00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:42.790
And it's just like one,

748
00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:43.810
it's like a feast.

749
00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:48.290
This is really our bike seeing some sort of like Christmas dinner and it's,

750
00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:51.100
and they do that every time they train and it's almost,

751
00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:52.130
I don't know what,

752
00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:52.951
what caused it,

753
00:21:52.951 --> 00:21:56.470
if it's like a human survival instinct that I'm exercising.

754
00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:57.940
So uh,

755
00:21:58.110 --> 00:21:58.330
I,

756
00:21:58.330 --> 00:21:58.601
you know,

757
00:21:58.601 --> 00:22:02.320
I got to keep pounding food in or what but I think it's just cause they have the

758
00:22:02.321 --> 00:22:03.580
food right there.

759
00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:04.091
You know,

760
00:22:04.091 --> 00:22:05.930
there was some study recently about uh,

761
00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:11.010
rehydrating and they were talking about like how much more people rehydrate if

762
00:22:11.171 --> 00:22:12.820
they're around things that tastes good.

763
00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:15.250
Like if you have like sugary drinks,

764
00:22:15.251 --> 00:22:16.540
like a Gatorade type drink,

765
00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:19.030
like how much more you'll drink than if it's just water,

766
00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:19.893
right?

767
00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:20.740
Yeah,

768
00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:23.020
we're just gross gross slovenly

769
00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:25.120
and sugars,

770
00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:26.140
like those simple sugars,

771
00:22:26.141 --> 00:22:27.900
like those are really not good for you.

772
00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:31.320
Mean you didn't get away with eating them after you work out because your body

773
00:22:31.321 --> 00:22:33.310
is sort of glucose craving.

774
00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:34.171
But the,

775
00:22:34.171 --> 00:22:37.150
the reality of those kinds of sports drinks and stuff like that,

776
00:22:37.151 --> 00:22:37.870
it's like this does,

777
00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:39.370
I'm fucking healthy for you at all.

778
00:22:39.371 --> 00:22:41.410
Those are corn syrup when look saloons.

779
00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:42.273
Now,

780
00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:43.840
that doesn't mean 30 mother fuckers.

781
00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:48.460
Well I think most of those sports drinks or are owned by companies that produce

782
00:22:48.461 --> 00:22:49.120
soft drinks.

783
00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:49.510
Yeah,

784
00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:51.130
I'm sure a lot of them are for sure.

785
00:22:51.131 --> 00:22:52.090
A lot of them are for sure,

786
00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:54.790
but they say the chocolate milk is the best thing to drink right after your

787
00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:55.240
workout.

788
00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:56.073
Is that true?

789
00:22:57.410 --> 00:22:57.640
It's,

790
00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:01.480
I guess it depends who you talk to and I think this is based on some studies

791
00:23:01.481 --> 00:23:02.314
that they've done,

792
00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:06.820
but if you talked to anyone that's a in the Chinese medicine or like my wife's

793
00:23:06.821 --> 00:23:08.260
really into Ayurvedic Medicine,

794
00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:10.720
milk is the demon.

795
00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:12.190
It's like they,

796
00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:12.701
what do they say?

797
00:23:12.701 --> 00:23:16.180
They say it's drinking plus and no cause drinking,

798
00:23:16.181 --> 00:23:17.014
pus.

799
00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:18.011
How's it drinking?

800
00:23:18.011 --> 00:23:18.400
Pus.

801
00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:19.330
They hate milk.

802
00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:20.373
Who are these people?

803
00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:21.873
Well anyway,

804
00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:25.210
have they ever eaten cookies because milk without cookies,

805
00:23:25.211 --> 00:23:26.044
it's just bullshit.

806
00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:28.050
Cookies without milk router.

807
00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:28.841
Yeah.

808
00:23:28.841 --> 00:23:29.171
There's a,

809
00:23:29.171 --> 00:23:34.171
there's a lot of people into this method of eating and eating for your body type

810
00:23:35.681 --> 00:23:36.514
and everything.

811
00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:37.410
And anyone that's a,

812
00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:40.000
there's three things in Chinese medicine that caused a lot of phlegm.

813
00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:41.740
And in Chinese medicine,

814
00:23:41.741 --> 00:23:44.920
phlegm is not only what you hack up when you're exercising,

815
00:23:44.921 --> 00:23:45.800
but uh,

816
00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:48.230
energy blockages in the system.

817
00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:50.960
So the top of the list is dairy.

818
00:23:51.970 --> 00:23:52.250
Uh,

819
00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:54.500
second is peanuts in third or bananas.

820
00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:57.290
You can't eat peanuts and you can't eat bananas.

821
00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:57.710
No.

822
00:23:57.710 --> 00:23:59.520
What kind of communist bullshit is this?

823
00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:01.670
What are they trying to say?

824
00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:02.450
Huh?

825
00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:03.283
Bananas.

826
00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:05.720
I know what the Fuck is wrong with bananas,

827
00:24:05.721 --> 00:24:06.554
man.

828
00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:09.860
I don't know if I buy this Chinese medicine and I did the people that brought

829
00:24:09.861 --> 00:24:11.360
you rhino horns for hard ons.

830
00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:12.640
Isn't that the same focus?

831
00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:13.250
Uh,

832
00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:13.581
yeah,

833
00:24:13.581 --> 00:24:15.230
they do all sorts of crazy stuff.

834
00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:17.180
How about tiger bone make you strong?

835
00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:17.511
No,

836
00:24:17.511 --> 00:24:19.340
it won't just kills fucking tiger.

837
00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:21.133
Tom Ass.

838
00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:21.891
Yeah.

839
00:24:21.891 --> 00:24:23.510
So I take all this stuff with a grain of salt.

840
00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:24.500
Yeah.

841
00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:24.651
Yeah.

842
00:24:24.651 --> 00:24:27.500
You should take it all with a couple of grains of salt.

843
00:24:27.501 --> 00:24:28.334
Salt's good for you.

844
00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:30.163
Tiger bone.

845
00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:31.213
Not so much.

846
00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:35.560
Are you into like that kind of acupuncture,

847
00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:36.381
acupressure,

848
00:24:36.381 --> 00:24:36.910
all that stuff.

849
00:24:36.910 --> 00:24:37.140
Yeah,

850
00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:38.300
we do that at our clinic.

851
00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:39.361
What,

852
00:24:39.361 --> 00:24:42.050
what kind of evidence is there that that stuff works?

853
00:24:42.051 --> 00:24:45.620
Is there ever been like peer reviewed studies and acupuncture,

854
00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:46.940
especially in Asia?

855
00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:47.420
Yeah,

856
00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:48.980
there are a lot of studies in Asia.

857
00:24:49.050 --> 00:24:49.820
Uh,

858
00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:52.100
when I took the course initially,

859
00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:53.390
there was a lot of,

860
00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:54.141
again,

861
00:24:54.141 --> 00:24:58.550
studies from Asia that indicate like memorize studies where they're taking an

862
00:24:58.551 --> 00:25:01.850
Mri of a person's brain and poking needles in different points.

863
00:25:01.851 --> 00:25:02.180
And there's,

864
00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:05.360
they're showing like major brain activity in different parts of the brains.

865
00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:06.201
Never understood it,

866
00:25:06.201 --> 00:25:08.510
but I've always liked looked at it curiously because I'm like,

867
00:25:08.511 --> 00:25:08.930
wow,

868
00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:11.660
so many people for so many years have been sticking needles in themselves.

869
00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:13.430
There's probably something to it,

870
00:25:13.431 --> 00:25:14.660
but you know,

871
00:25:14.661 --> 00:25:17.750
like I've heard people criticize yoga and one of the things that they say about

872
00:25:17.751 --> 00:25:19.460
yoga is that it's just stretching.

873
00:25:19.461 --> 00:25:21.680
Like my friend Penn Jillette from Penn and teller,

874
00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:22.601
they did this,

875
00:25:22.601 --> 00:25:22.750
uh,

876
00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:24.470
episode of Penn Jillette's bullshit,

877
00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:26.270
Penn and teller's bullshit.

878
00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:27.213
You remember that show?

879
00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:27.800
Yeah.

880
00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:28.340
Yeah.

881
00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:29.930
And they did one on yoga where they were like,

882
00:25:29.931 --> 00:25:30.770
it's just stretching.

883
00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:31.211
It's just true.

884
00:25:31.211 --> 00:25:32.044
And they were showing,

885
00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:33.060
and I want to say,

886
00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:33.920
listen man,

887
00:25:33.921 --> 00:25:34.880
this ain't cool.

888
00:25:34.881 --> 00:25:36.530
You guys are out of shape.

889
00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:37.151
You don't really,

890
00:25:37.151 --> 00:25:38.120
you're not really working out.

891
00:25:38.121 --> 00:25:38.630
You're not.

892
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:39.920
If you do yoga,

893
00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:42.170
it doesn't seem like it's anything more than stretching,

894
00:25:42.171 --> 00:25:43.220
but if you do yoga,

895
00:25:43.221 --> 00:25:44.054
you get high.

896
00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:45.230
That was just a fact.

897
00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:47.540
If you do like a big rooms class,

898
00:25:47.541 --> 00:25:49.910
you do like a 90 minute yoga class,

899
00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:52.490
you will feel high at the end of it.

900
00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:54.950
It's just a fact that is unavoidable.

901
00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:59.360
I mean you can't deny that it's undeniable and to say that that's just

902
00:25:59.361 --> 00:26:01.730
stretching that all you're doing is just moving your body around.

903
00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:02.570
Man,

904
00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:03.410
I don't think so.

905
00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:05.480
Those skinny little motherfuckers from India,

906
00:26:05.481 --> 00:26:07.550
I've been doing that shit for a thousand years for a reason.

907
00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:08.720
There's something to it.

908
00:26:08.721 --> 00:26:09.980
They've figured out something.

909
00:26:09.981 --> 00:26:14.981
They figured out some way to tap into your endorphin system in some major way so

910
00:26:15.171 --> 00:26:18.410
that you get a big reward when you do like a long yoga class.

911
00:26:18.411 --> 00:26:23.411
It's a very piece sort of inducing movement or a series of movements.

912
00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:24.501
Well,

913
00:26:24.501 --> 00:26:25.760
and it goes,

914
00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:27.230
a lot of these uh,

915
00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:28.460
uh,

916
00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:30.860
systems coincide with each other.

917
00:26:30.861 --> 00:26:32.360
So with Chinese medicine,

918
00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:33.080
uh,

919
00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:33.920
they do cheat gone.

920
00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:37.850
And so that's all about bringing the breath in with,

921
00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:40.310
with the breath comes out like a breath of fire.

922
00:26:40.311 --> 00:26:41.600
Is that the same thing?

923
00:26:41.790 --> 00:26:42.890
That's a variation of it.

924
00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:43.530
Um,

925
00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:44.010
Chigong

926
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:47.670
<v 1>is more for a healing yourself through energy cultivation.</v>

927
00:26:47.671 --> 00:26:51.270
So you're bringing the energy in through your lungs and then you're doing

928
00:26:51.271 --> 00:26:54.840
certain movements or tie cheese and other good example and you're stretching

929
00:26:54.841 --> 00:26:55.260
those,

930
00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:58.860
those energy meridians that go through your body while you're breathing in.

931
00:26:58.861 --> 00:26:59.250
So the,

932
00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:03.540
in the in breath brings the CI in and then you do these particular movements

933
00:27:03.541 --> 00:27:05.670
that that forces that ci down.

934
00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:07.860
Your Meridians cheesy though.

935
00:27:07.861 --> 00:27:08.200
Is there,

936
00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:08.520
if there,

937
00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:10.950
is anybody ever like shown ci and Mri?

938
00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:12.720
Like what's going on when he's saying,

939
00:27:12.721 --> 00:27:12.871
look,

940
00:27:12.871 --> 00:27:13.910
you're forcing your cheat,

941
00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:15.210
is it circulation?

942
00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:16.740
Is it just your,

943
00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:17.551
your focus,

944
00:27:17.551 --> 00:27:18.271
your energy?

945
00:27:18.271 --> 00:27:19.104
Like what is it?

946
00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:19.951
It is that,

947
00:27:19.951 --> 00:27:20.784
and it's also,

948
00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:25.650
I believe that they've shown that there are electromagnetic forces going across

949
00:27:25.651 --> 00:27:26.190
our skin.

950
00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:30.750
Apparently they found acupuncture points in cadavers and it's an acupuncture.

951
00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:38.160
I'm going to help all the needles in you want like an acupuncture point is

952
00:27:38.731 --> 00:27:41.670
actually an area of lower energy resistance,

953
00:27:41.671 --> 00:27:42.990
lower electrical resistance.

954
00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:43.650
And it's,

955
00:27:43.650 --> 00:27:44.370
it's uh,

956
00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:44.700
on it.

957
00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:46.470
We all have them and they're all in the same place.

958
00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:51.540
So when they're using needles and they're sticking them in various parts of your

959
00:27:51.541 --> 00:27:52.200
body,

960
00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:54.470
like how do they know where to stick them on?

961
00:27:54.471 --> 00:27:55.470
What does it based on?

962
00:27:55.850 --> 00:27:56.280
Uh,

963
00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:57.720
mostly it's based on,

964
00:27:57.721 --> 00:27:58.351
believe it or not,

965
00:27:58.351 --> 00:28:00.270
your body dimensions.

966
00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:03.390
So your body dimensions would be different than mine.

967
00:28:03.391 --> 00:28:06.090
So I would figure that out by using my hand.

968
00:28:06.450 --> 00:28:10.890
So the width of my hand from these knuckles here would be three cin,

969
00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:12.150
three Chinese inches.

970
00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:14.050
Now your hand is,

971
00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:15.480
might be bigger than mine.

972
00:28:15.481 --> 00:28:20.160
So I would use this part of the knuckles for the three cheese partier.

973
00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:20.960
Yeah.

974
00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:23.250
If euro say had a smaller hand,

975
00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:24.960
I would use these knuckles here.

976
00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:27.810
I want you to know when to decide.

977
00:28:27.811 --> 00:28:27.961
Like,

978
00:28:27.961 --> 00:28:29.340
what if you've got a medium hand,

979
00:28:29.550 --> 00:28:31.540
you don't want to be off with your needle placed.

980
00:28:32.370 --> 00:28:33.203
Well,

981
00:28:33.270 --> 00:28:35.430
acupuncture points are about the size of a dime.

982
00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:36.210
Okay.

983
00:28:36.210 --> 00:28:37.530
So it was a bit of wiggle room there.

984
00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:38.490
But I think,

985
00:28:38.491 --> 00:28:39.220
uh,

986
00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:42.330
I think a lot of these people that do it all the time and the people that are

987
00:28:42.331 --> 00:28:44.580
real hardcore Chinese medical practitioners,

988
00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:45.061
they,

989
00:28:45.061 --> 00:28:49.260
I think they almost have a sense of where the energy is to ever see that movie

990
00:28:49.261 --> 00:28:52.620
with Steven Seagal was in a coma for a long time and they put some acupuncture

991
00:28:52.621 --> 00:28:54.300
needles in and he came out of the car,

992
00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:55.650
start fucking people up.

993
00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:56.830
He had the,

994
00:28:56.830 --> 00:29:00.150
he gave himself the acupuncture needles with the Moxa yeah.

995
00:29:00.151 --> 00:29:02.220
With the glowing incense at the end of it.

996
00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:03.140
So one is called Yep.

997
00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:04.170
So when we,

998
00:29:04.171 --> 00:29:04.950
uh,

999
00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:05.990
took her Chinese medicine,

1000
00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:06.960
we took a few courses,

1001
00:29:06.961 --> 00:29:07.340
but the,

1002
00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:09.180
the best one we took was a,

1003
00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:10.890
at the nearby university.

1004
00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:14.280
Right where you did your show last in Edmonton.

1005
00:29:14.910 --> 00:29:15.930
And the guy there,

1006
00:29:15.931 --> 00:29:17.610
doctor Ong is a master.

1007
00:29:17.611 --> 00:29:22.611
He comes from many generations of Chinese medical doctors and he's from Burma

1008
00:29:22.621 --> 00:29:23.131
originally,

1009
00:29:23.131 --> 00:29:25.890
but he's also a western medical doctor.

1010
00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:28.440
So he kind of has a nice perspective on things.

1011
00:29:28.441 --> 00:29:29.820
He's not just one sided,

1012
00:29:29.821 --> 00:29:31.710
he's and uh,

1013
00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:33.870
but he loved walks up.

1014
00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:34.141
He,

1015
00:29:34.141 --> 00:29:34.261
oh,

1016
00:29:34.261 --> 00:29:35.360
he liked that stuff where it,

1017
00:29:35.361 --> 00:29:36.270
and it smells.

1018
00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:37.133
It's sage.

1019
00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:38.451
If he didn't,

1020
00:29:38.451 --> 00:29:40.620
why they call it mock to then watch called sage.

1021
00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:41.980
That's with all the names.

1022
00:29:42.570 --> 00:29:44.860
<v 3>I just tell people call it sage mark.</v>

1023
00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:45.733
So

1024
00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:49.290
someone copywriting Moxa is,

1025
00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:50.620
it marks a TM.

1026
00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:52.240
So you take this,

1027
00:29:52.241 --> 00:29:52.630
um,

1028
00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:54.370
siege and you put at the end of the needle.

1029
00:29:54.371 --> 00:29:56.170
What purpose does it serve at the end of the day at all?

1030
00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:58.120
I've always wondered that she more cheat.

1031
00:29:58.180 --> 00:29:59.170
So it not applying it,

1032
00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:00.280
taking it rains.

1033
00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:02.460
That's where I'm out.

1034
00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:03.250
That shit don't work.

1035
00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:03.721
You can't,

1036
00:30:03.721 --> 00:30:06.700
he can't get more cheap by a burning thing that's in the end of a needle.

1037
00:30:06.850 --> 00:30:07.840
How does it give you more cheap?

1038
00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:08.830
It warms up the needle.

1039
00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:09.701
Oh,

1040
00:30:09.701 --> 00:30:10.090
okay.

1041
00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:11.230
Well actually actually makes sense.

1042
00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:11.650
Okay.

1043
00:30:11.650 --> 00:30:13.360
I take it back and come back in

1044
00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:16.210
and there's two types of mocks.

1045
00:30:16.211 --> 00:30:19.060
So there's the type that you stick on the end of the needle and then there's

1046
00:30:19.061 --> 00:30:20.290
like a big long stick,

1047
00:30:20.291 --> 00:30:24.160
like a big cigar and you liked the end of that and then you wave it over

1048
00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:28.060
different [inaudible] like there's a major energy point on our belly button and

1049
00:30:28.061 --> 00:30:29.920
that's actually a forbidden point in Chinese.

1050
00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:30.850
Same with your nipples.

1051
00:30:30.851 --> 00:30:30.971
Hey,

1052
00:30:30.971 --> 00:30:32.740
you don't want to be putting needles in these places,

1053
00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:34.720
penises and other one of them.

1054
00:30:34.721 --> 00:30:37.240
I'm pretty sure the scrotum also like so they're smart.

1055
00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:38.790
They knew where not to put the needs.

1056
00:30:38.791 --> 00:30:40.030
Don't put needles in your penis.

1057
00:30:40.031 --> 00:30:41.530
How fucking smart out of these people,

1058
00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:44.890
because they're not putting bases on the moon.

1059
00:30:44.891 --> 00:30:46.570
They're just saying don't stick needles in your deck.

1060
00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:47.650
I could have told you that.

1061
00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:48.820
I'm not even educated.

1062
00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:51.650
So that this,

1063
00:30:51.730 --> 00:30:53.740
when you say like major energy centers,

1064
00:30:53.741 --> 00:30:55.900
like an energy center in the stomach area.

1065
00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:56.470
Yeah.

1066
00:30:56.470 --> 00:30:57.220
What does that mean?

1067
00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:59.290
So that's where a lot of energy is stored.

1068
00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:00.280
Railing.

1069
00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:00.640
Yeah.

1070
00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:01.810
Is there a battery down there?

1071
00:31:02.050 --> 00:31:02.381
Uh,

1072
00:31:02.381 --> 00:31:02.651
no,

1073
00:31:02.651 --> 00:31:03.011
but it's,

1074
00:31:03.011 --> 00:31:03.844
it's almost like

1075
00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:06.660
a pool of,

1076
00:31:06.770 --> 00:31:08.590
of this vital energy that we breathe in.

1077
00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:09.693
Yeah.

1078
00:31:10.090 --> 00:31:11.410
But how's it stored there?

1079
00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:12.993
Um,

1080
00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:13.901
I'm just,

1081
00:31:13.901 --> 00:31:17.470
I'm challenging this because I'm playing devil's advocate first of all,

1082
00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:20.920
but also because I wanted to ask you about these things because I've had these

1083
00:31:20.921 --> 00:31:22.750
conversations with people and I'm always like,

1084
00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:24.400
I gotta go.

1085
00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:25.233
Like I can't,

1086
00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:26.200
people started going,

1087
00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:26.381
Oh,

1088
00:31:26.381 --> 00:31:31.120
I'm puling my energy and I'm bringing the Moxa enlightens my ci and like I gotta

1089
00:31:31.121 --> 00:31:31.450
go,

1090
00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:32.283
I can't,

1091
00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:33.610
I don't have the time.

1092
00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:33.971
So,

1093
00:31:33.971 --> 00:31:34.990
but you're here right now.

1094
00:31:34.991 --> 00:31:38.320
So I really want to know what the fuck is up with all this pooling of the

1095
00:31:38.321 --> 00:31:38.801
energy,

1096
00:31:38.801 --> 00:31:40.900
storing of the energy willing.

1097
00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:41.773
It's all shot.

1098
00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:43.780
That's a good,

1099
00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:46.510
that brings me back to the scientific part of it.

1100
00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:51.520
So these chakras are the same as major energy centers in Chinese medicine,

1101
00:31:51.521 --> 00:31:53.890
which are the same as our endocrine system.

1102
00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:59.050
So I suppose the Chakra and your navel,

1103
00:31:59.560 --> 00:31:59.891
uh,

1104
00:31:59.891 --> 00:32:03.460
would coincide with the adrenal glands.

1105
00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:04.240
Hmm.

1106
00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:07.150
How much of this stuff do you think is like,

1107
00:32:07.151 --> 00:32:08.990
things along the lines of,

1108
00:32:09.050 --> 00:32:09.730
uh,

1109
00:32:09.730 --> 00:32:12.010
acupuncture or you know,

1110
00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:13.690
this types of meditation,

1111
00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:18.520
how much of them are actually changing your state because you're just focusing

1112
00:32:18.521 --> 00:32:19.270
on it?

1113
00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:20.280
And how much of is not,

1114
00:32:20.281 --> 00:32:22.030
not necessarily a placebo effect,

1115
00:32:22.270 --> 00:32:23.830
but in the act of saying,

1116
00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:24.693
okay,

1117
00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:27.730
they're putting needles in various spots in my body.

1118
00:32:27.731 --> 00:32:29.770
I'm putting myself in a very calm place.

1119
00:32:29.771 --> 00:32:34.771
They're lighting the Moxa like just getting yourself calm and accepting the fact

1120
00:32:36.491 --> 00:32:38.650
that you're in treatment at that moment,

1121
00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:40.040
which is very different than you

1122
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:40.700
<v 2>would be normally.</v>

1123
00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:43.070
Say if you have like a backache or something like that.

1124
00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:44.270
Have you have a backache?

1125
00:32:44.550 --> 00:32:44.751
Like,

1126
00:32:44.751 --> 00:32:45.010
God,

1127
00:32:45.010 --> 00:32:46.820
my back socks really been fucking with me.

1128
00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:52.030
But do you ever like sit down and try to calm your whole body and meditate it if

1129
00:32:52.911 --> 00:32:53.744
you did,

1130
00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:57.020
would that bring the same result of sticking yourself with a bunch of needles

1131
00:32:57.050 --> 00:32:57.920
and thinking about it?

1132
00:32:58.400 --> 00:32:59.400
<v 1>I know what I'm saying.</v>

1133
00:32:59.430 --> 00:32:59.541
Yeah.

1134
00:32:59.541 --> 00:33:00.040
It makes sense.

1135
00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:00.990
It totally does.

1136
00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:01.680
Um,

1137
00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:01.861
yeah,

1138
00:33:01.861 --> 00:33:02.370
because you are,

1139
00:33:02.370 --> 00:33:05.250
you're in this state and the mind is so powerful or is it both?

1140
00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:06.080
Is it

1141
00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:07.160
<v 2>being in that state,</v>

1142
00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:10.460
like calming yourself down and there's also an effect by the needles?

1143
00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:11.160
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1144
00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:11.900
I think it is both.

1145
00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:15.990
I think there is having had acupuncture done to myself many times.

1146
00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:17.133
Um,

1147
00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:22.280
my take on it from doing it for a long time is these needles are going into our,

1148
00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:23.791
our skin,

1149
00:33:23.791 --> 00:33:26.680
which is a huge sensory map and the,

1150
00:33:26.970 --> 00:33:28.050
the needles are so fine.

1151
00:33:28.051 --> 00:33:30.090
They actually don't cut us there.

1152
00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:33.000
It's like taking a baseball bat and putting into a vat of Cook Spaghetti.

1153
00:33:33.001 --> 00:33:33.330
It,

1154
00:33:33.330 --> 00:33:34.680
it's so they're so skinny,

1155
00:33:34.681 --> 00:33:36.570
the other slide and it's really weird.

1156
00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:37.050
Yeah.

1157
00:33:37.050 --> 00:33:38.100
And didn't even hurt.

1158
00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:40.230
Like people think that they hurt you barely feel them.

1159
00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:40.560
Yeah.

1160
00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:41.393
So,

1161
00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:42.090
um,

1162
00:33:42.090 --> 00:33:44.360
I think it occupies a little bit of space and that,

1163
00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:45.870
that signals the brain that,

1164
00:33:46.170 --> 00:33:46.411
wow,

1165
00:33:46.411 --> 00:33:49.230
there's something going on here that I don't like.

1166
00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:53.490
So then it sounds sends down national antiinflammatories and sends down more

1167
00:33:53.491 --> 00:33:54.420
blood circulation,

1168
00:33:54.421 --> 00:33:56.120
almost a sets the,

1169
00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:58.800
the healing environment.

1170
00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:01.830
Have you ever done whole body cryotherapy?

1171
00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:03.413
No.

1172
00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:07.110
<v 2>This is the shit you got to try this.</v>

1173
00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:07.861
This is the,

1174
00:34:07.861 --> 00:34:09.660
the latest and greatest thing.

1175
00:34:09.661 --> 00:34:11.880
Like I had heard about Kobe Bryant using it,

1176
00:34:11.881 --> 00:34:13.650
but my friend Eddie Bravo,

1177
00:34:13.651 --> 00:34:16.650
when he's preparing for his match against Hoya Gracie and Metamorris,

1178
00:34:16.740 --> 00:34:17.040
uh,

1179
00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:19.740
he started using it on a daily basis and uh,

1180
00:34:19.741 --> 00:34:20.521
Allen Joe Band,

1181
00:34:20.521 --> 00:34:22.190
one of our fighters from a 10th planet,

1182
00:34:22.191 --> 00:34:23.220
we just fought in the UFC.

1183
00:34:23.450 --> 00:34:23.810
He,

1184
00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:24.240
he was,

1185
00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:29.040
his knee was hurt and he did it twice a day every day before his last UFC fight

1186
00:34:29.041 --> 00:34:31.410
and it totally fixed all the inflammation is knee.

1187
00:34:31.770 --> 00:34:33.180
You go into this tank,

1188
00:34:33.390 --> 00:34:35.700
it's like this box,

1189
00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:36.080
you know,

1190
00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:36.930
it's just like,

1191
00:34:36.931 --> 00:34:38.580
oh it looks like a meat locker,

1192
00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:39.120
right?

1193
00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:40.140
There's two different doors.

1194
00:34:41.150 --> 00:34:43.560
One door is where you take your clothes off and you,

1195
00:34:43.561 --> 00:34:44.640
you keep your underwear on,

1196
00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:45.840
you have earmuffs on,

1197
00:34:45.841 --> 00:34:46.160
you have a,

1198
00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:49.380
you wear a mask over your face and you wear socks and slippers cause the floor

1199
00:34:49.381 --> 00:34:50.730
is fucking ridiculously cold.

1200
00:34:51.090 --> 00:34:53.220
You have gloves on as well and you go into this room,

1201
00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:57.750
it's 250 degrees below zero and you'd go there for three minutes.

1202
00:34:57.751 --> 00:34:58.530
That's what I do.

1203
00:34:58.530 --> 00:35:01.020
I do three minutes because I'm not a pussy pussies.

1204
00:35:01.021 --> 00:35:02.340
They get out at about two minutes.

1205
00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:03.150
I fucking hang.

1206
00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:04.710
I don't even know if he should do three minutes.

1207
00:35:04.711 --> 00:35:07.170
Probably not even a benefit of going that extra 30 seconds.

1208
00:35:07.171 --> 00:35:08.440
But I'm a meathead,

1209
00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:09.293
so I continue.

1210
00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:09.770
Uh,

1211
00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:10.620
so you go in there,

1212
00:35:10.650 --> 00:35:11.490
you do three minutes,

1213
00:35:11.491 --> 00:35:13.200
and then you get out and I warm up,

1214
00:35:13.290 --> 00:35:15.870
I get on an elliptical machine and I do it for like the elliptical machine for

1215
00:35:15.871 --> 00:35:16.704
like 10 minutes,

1216
00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:17.710
get my body temperature up,

1217
00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:19.800
then I go back in again for another three minutes.

1218
00:35:20.130 --> 00:35:21.000
And it is,

1219
00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:23.940
it's ridiculously good for inflammation,

1220
00:35:23.941 --> 00:35:26.790
ridiculously good for any aches or pains that you might have,

1221
00:35:26.791 --> 00:35:30.270
like muscle soreness because your body freaks the fuck out.

1222
00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:34.470
It feels it's 250 degrees below zero and it just goes holy shit.

1223
00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:38.130
And it pulls all the blood from the surface of your down to your core.

1224
00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:40.380
Then three minutes later when you're out,

1225
00:35:40.410 --> 00:35:40.621
you know,

1226
00:35:40.621 --> 00:35:40.830
it's,

1227
00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:43.050
it's enough time so you're not dying of hypothermia.

1228
00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:44.900
You go out and then your body goes,

1229
00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:45.061
oh,

1230
00:35:45.061 --> 00:35:47.910
we're okay and we should all just rushes out.

1231
00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:52.620
And it's been explained to me and very technical and scientific terms,

1232
00:35:52.621 --> 00:35:55.770
all the different mechanisms that are going on in the body that are protecting

1233
00:35:55.771 --> 00:35:56.604
you from,

1234
00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:57.090
you know,

1235
00:35:57.090 --> 00:35:58.950
from this impending death by,

1236
00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:00.210
by cold.

1237
00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:01.770
And so when you're,

1238
00:36:02.050 --> 00:36:03.750
your body realizes that it's not happening.

1239
00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:04.561
Like what's,

1240
00:36:04.561 --> 00:36:05.281
what is the,

1241
00:36:05.281 --> 00:36:05.701
the,

1242
00:36:05.701 --> 00:36:05.970
um,

1243
00:36:05.970 --> 00:36:08.880
the actual mechanism that causes this anti inflammatory response.

1244
00:36:08.881 --> 00:36:12.180
But it's way better than these ice pass and people have been taking for a long

1245
00:36:12.181 --> 00:36:14.220
time and they sit in these things for 20 minutes.

1246
00:36:14.430 --> 00:36:16.410
This is way better and it only takes three minutes.

1247
00:36:16.590 --> 00:36:17.423
It's amazing.

1248
00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:18.600
You got to try it.

1249
00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:20.040
Have you tried the ice baths?

1250
00:36:20.490 --> 00:36:21.720
I've done an ice bath before.

1251
00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:22.290
You know,

1252
00:36:22.290 --> 00:36:23.123
it's good.

1253
00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:24.143
This is better.

1254
00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:24.840
This is better.

1255
00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:25.890
It's not as painful either.

1256
00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:27.420
It painful.

1257
00:36:27.421 --> 00:36:29.570
Plus you don't have to get your Dick wet there.

1258
00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:30.413
I said that out loud.

1259
00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:31.201
I think,

1260
00:36:31.201 --> 00:36:31.830
um,

1261
00:36:31.830 --> 00:36:32.250
the,

1262
00:36:32.250 --> 00:36:33.600
the ice bath is a great thing.

1263
00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:34.200
I mean if you,

1264
00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:35.220
if that's all you have,

1265
00:36:35.221 --> 00:36:35.401
I mean,

1266
00:36:35.401 --> 00:36:37.710
they are painful and it's also good for your,

1267
00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:39.420
you like your spirit,

1268
00:36:39.690 --> 00:36:41.310
like your ability to endure.

1269
00:36:41.610 --> 00:36:42.443
Like,

1270
00:36:43.110 --> 00:36:45.180
I think that like being uncomfortable,

1271
00:36:45.181 --> 00:36:49.350
your ability to endure comfort or discomfort is a muscle just like everything

1272
00:36:49.351 --> 00:36:49.800
else.

1273
00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:52.260
And my friend Bob Calf Varella when I was,

1274
00:36:52.261 --> 00:36:52.490
uh,

1275
00:36:52.490 --> 00:36:54.240
back in my taekwondo getting days,

1276
00:36:54.241 --> 00:36:57.270
there was this guy who was one of the senior students when I was first starting

1277
00:36:57.271 --> 00:36:57.840
out.

1278
00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:00.000
He was a black belt when I was a white belt and his name is Bob.

1279
00:37:00.450 --> 00:37:03.890
And he used to live at the school and teach and train their bobcat.

1280
00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:08.460
Barela and Bob used to take fucking cold showers in the middle of January in

1281
00:37:08.461 --> 00:37:09.294
Boston.

1282
00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:13.500
He would just crank up the cold water and just get in that shower and wash like

1283
00:37:13.530 --> 00:37:14.490
nothing was going on.

1284
00:37:14.491 --> 00:37:15.001
And I would go,

1285
00:37:15.001 --> 00:37:16.110
I can't believe he's doing this.

1286
00:37:16.111 --> 00:37:16.381
I can't.

1287
00:37:16.381 --> 00:37:17.760
It's so called,

1288
00:37:17.761 --> 00:37:19.380
the water was so fucking cold.

1289
00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:20.760
And he'd be in there just,

1290
00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:26.340
just doing breathing exercises and taking a shower and everybody else to get the

1291
00:37:26.341 --> 00:37:26.890
fuck out of here,

1292
00:37:26.890 --> 00:37:28.860
turn that water on hot and take their shower.

1293
00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:29.963
But this dude,

1294
00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:31.111
he,

1295
00:37:31.111 --> 00:37:31.770
um,

1296
00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:35.760
he really believed in testing your spirit and he thought that that taking these

1297
00:37:35.761 --> 00:37:37.080
ridiculously cold showers,

1298
00:37:37.081 --> 00:37:39.330
like actually it probably in the long run,

1299
00:37:39.331 --> 00:37:40.590
it was actually good for your body.

1300
00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:44.880
Now that we're knowing about cryotherapy and things along those lines and ice

1301
00:37:44.881 --> 00:37:45.510
pass,

1302
00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:49.320
it's probably actually good like post workout for anti inflammatory response.

1303
00:37:49.710 --> 00:37:50.700
But it was also,

1304
00:37:50.730 --> 00:37:51.900
he believed that it would,

1305
00:37:52.290 --> 00:37:54.750
it's like a muscle that you're testing your will,

1306
00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:56.131
you know,

1307
00:37:56.131 --> 00:37:59.100
and by doing that and putting yourself constantly in that state of mind where

1308
00:37:59.101 --> 00:38:02.820
you can endure discomfort that you build up your ability to endure discomfort.

1309
00:38:04.050 --> 00:38:04.650
Yeah.

1310
00:38:04.650 --> 00:38:04.970
Yeah.

1311
00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:05.803
It's kind of,

1312
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:06.480
again,

1313
00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:07.470
kind of like kettlebells.

1314
00:38:07.570 --> 00:38:08.403
Yeah.

1315
00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:09.900
I want to send you down there today though,

1316
00:38:09.901 --> 00:38:10.860
after this is over,

1317
00:38:11.130 --> 00:38:12.960
I want to send you down to that cryotherapy place.

1318
00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:13.771
Yeah.

1319
00:38:13.771 --> 00:38:14.401
You need to do it.

1320
00:38:14.401 --> 00:38:15.180
You need to do,

1321
00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:17.010
I want to hear what your response to it is.

1322
00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:19.500
Everybody that I've brought down there and they fight.

1323
00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:21.210
It's called Cryo healthcare in La.

1324
00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:22.171
And uh,

1325
00:38:22.171 --> 00:38:22.980
they're one of,

1326
00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:27.120
I think there's only two places in the whole country that have the very specific

1327
00:38:27.121 --> 00:38:29.010
type of cryotherapy device they have.

1328
00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:30.570
We step all the way in.

1329
00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:32.760
Usually there's one where your body's in,

1330
00:38:32.761 --> 00:38:36.100
but your head is above it and it's sort of like a liquid nitrogen that keeps you

1331
00:38:36.101 --> 00:38:36.934
freezing cold,

1332
00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:40.000
but that's not as consistent as the one where you step in,

1333
00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:41.051
you step in.

1334
00:38:41.051 --> 00:38:41.231
I mean,

1335
00:38:41.231 --> 00:38:42.370
your fucking heads in it,

1336
00:38:42.371 --> 00:38:43.204
your face is in it,

1337
00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:44.170
you're going to love it.

1338
00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:45.310
I can't wait.

1339
00:38:45.310 --> 00:38:49.630
It's just so cool that they're always coming up with these new ways to increase

1340
00:38:49.631 --> 00:38:54.631
the body's ability to recover new ways to increase your body's ability to fight

1341
00:38:54.971 --> 00:38:55.900
inflammation,

1342
00:38:56.220 --> 00:38:56.890
you know?

1343
00:38:56.890 --> 00:38:57.091
Well,

1344
00:38:57.091 --> 00:38:58.600
in a lot of it is based on,

1345
00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:01.000
they're just making something old better.

1346
00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:02.250
Like we'd known that,

1347
00:39:02.250 --> 00:39:03.083
you know,

1348
00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:08.340
probably cold showers are cold baths are jumping into cold lake is good or ice

1349
00:39:08.411 --> 00:39:09.190
on injuries.

1350
00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:09.670
Yeah,

1351
00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:10.180
yeah.

1352
00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:11.620
They've just taken it one step further.

1353
00:39:11.621 --> 00:39:13.090
It's amazing with the technology.

1354
00:39:14.050 --> 00:39:14.321
Yeah,

1355
00:39:14.321 --> 00:39:14.910
it really is.

1356
00:39:14.910 --> 00:39:15.090
It's,

1357
00:39:15.090 --> 00:39:18.970
it's super cool and you feel so fucking good when you get out of it.

1358
00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:19.931
When you go into it,

1359
00:39:19.931 --> 00:39:20.141
you're,

1360
00:39:20.141 --> 00:39:20.620
you are,

1361
00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:23.350
you're so god damn coal for those three minutes and when you get out it's like,

1362
00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:25.360
Ooh,

1363
00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:27.460
you get this wild at Trent Allen Rush.

1364
00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:29.350
You start like jogging in place.

1365
00:39:29.530 --> 00:39:30.490
You feel so good.

1366
00:39:30.491 --> 00:39:33.790
Your brain's firing pop out like we're going to live.

1367
00:39:34.110 --> 00:39:35.010
Yeah.

1368
00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:38.470
Your body is really convinced that you're fucked.

1369
00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:42.430
Like it's like you're naked and you were dropped off on the top of the earth.

1370
00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:44.420
I don't even think like the North Poles,

1371
00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:46.840
250 degrees below zero now.

1372
00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:48.400
Like what's the coldest spot on earth?

1373
00:39:49.390 --> 00:39:50.223
I would say it's probably like,

1374
00:39:50.450 --> 00:39:50.530
oh,

1375
00:39:50.530 --> 00:39:51.130
I'm going to guess.

1376
00:39:51.130 --> 00:39:51.970
Let's just guess.

1377
00:39:52.510 --> 00:39:55.360
I think where that sue Akins chick lives life below zero.

1378
00:39:56.110 --> 00:39:56.943
She's my hero.

1379
00:39:57.310 --> 00:40:00.130
That bitch lives in the middle of Alaska by herself shooting bears.

1380
00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:01.001
But uh,

1381
00:40:01.001 --> 00:40:01.870
I think that's like,

1382
00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:05.920
it gets to like one 91 90 below with the cold spot on earth.

1383
00:40:05.921 --> 00:40:06.370
Jeremy,

1384
00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:08.290
the highest ridge and Antarctica.

1385
00:40:08.950 --> 00:40:11.560
I'm trying to find the highest ridge and Antarctica.

1386
00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:17.160
The coldest thinness atmosphere somewhat is one 36.

1387
00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:18.310
That's it.

1388
00:40:18.310 --> 00:40:19.143
Yep.

1389
00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:22.570
Bitch ass one 36 seven and nothing cooler than dry ice.

1390
00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:24.130
Cold and dry eyes.

1391
00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:25.113
So this is,

1392
00:40:25.450 --> 00:40:25.721
oh,

1393
00:40:25.721 --> 00:40:26.350
nothing.

1394
00:40:26.350 --> 00:40:29.500
Just 114 degrees colder than that.

1395
00:40:30.370 --> 00:40:31.630
Wrap your head around that Sun.

1396
00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:33.970
That's fucking ridiculous.

1397
00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:38.230
To 5,250 degrees below zero and no frostbite.

1398
00:40:38.350 --> 00:40:38.680
Nope.

1399
00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:39.610
I'm a nipple a little bit,

1400
00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:40.950
but it's all kind of new.

1401
00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:41.980
New didn't need it?

1402
00:40:42.990 --> 00:40:43.823
No,

1403
00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:44.080
no.

1404
00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:44.450
You will.

1405
00:40:44.450 --> 00:40:44.951
You um,

1406
00:40:44.951 --> 00:40:45.784
you wear gloves,

1407
00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:47.230
you wear a face mask.

1408
00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:47.751
Uh,

1409
00:40:47.751 --> 00:40:48.940
you wear ear muffs.

1410
00:40:49.210 --> 00:40:49.980
Is that the spot?

1411
00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:50.350
Yeah.

1412
00:40:50.350 --> 00:40:51.490
Hundred 36 below zero.

1413
00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:52.960
Wow.

1414
00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:53.870
New Record for the calls.

1415
00:40:53.871 --> 00:40:54.371
Place on earth.

1416
00:40:54.371 --> 00:40:55.330
What happened to global warning?

1417
00:40:55.331 --> 00:40:55.810
Bitch?

1418
00:40:55.810 --> 00:40:57.280
I bought real estate up there.

1419
00:40:57.340 --> 00:40:58.750
I'm hoping for global warming.

1420
00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:00.700
I'm trying to set up a mall,

1421
00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:03.400
but the,

1422
00:41:03.401 --> 00:41:04.234
um,

1423
00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:04.931
the,

1424
00:41:04.931 --> 00:41:06.850
if that's the coldest place on earth still,

1425
00:41:06.851 --> 00:41:07.091
I mean,

1426
00:41:07.091 --> 00:41:10.510
it's amazing that this box is 114 degrees colder than that.

1427
00:41:11.470 --> 00:41:12.303
Wow.

1428
00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:15.370
114 degrees colder.

1429
00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:16.600
One 14.

1430
00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:17.680
It's called fuck.

1431
00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:19.840
And how many times do you do this?

1432
00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:21.220
I tried to do it a couple times a week.

1433
00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:22.541
Yeah,

1434
00:41:22.541 --> 00:41:22.770
it's,

1435
00:41:22.770 --> 00:41:23.470
it's really good.

1436
00:41:23.470 --> 00:41:25.010
And you go in and out a couple of times.

1437
00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:25.541
You have,

1438
00:41:25.541 --> 00:41:25.870
I don't,

1439
00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:26.703
I do it twice.

1440
00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:28.300
I go in to a for a little while.

1441
00:41:28.330 --> 00:41:29.510
Remember that dude from um,

1442
00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:33.680
the fresh prince will Smith's buddy was there yesterday?

1443
00:41:33.770 --> 00:41:34.270
Yeah.

1444
00:41:34.270 --> 00:41:34.610
Yeah,

1445
00:41:34.610 --> 00:41:35.361
he was doing it yesterday.

1446
00:41:35.361 --> 00:41:36.500
He was on dancing with the stars.

1447
00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:36.890
Yeah.

1448
00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:37.723
It's a great video.

1449
00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:38.583
He's a nice guy.

1450
00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:39.621
Very nice guy.

1451
00:41:39.621 --> 00:41:39.921
Yes sir.

1452
00:41:39.921 --> 00:41:40.760
I met him for the first time,

1453
00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:42.013
but um,

1454
00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:42.471
that,

1455
00:41:42.471 --> 00:41:43.170
that uh,

1456
00:41:43.170 --> 00:41:47.030
the response of your body like freaking out because of the cold and then warming

1457
00:41:47.031 --> 00:41:48.050
up and then doing it again.

1458
00:41:48.051 --> 00:41:50.030
It's supposed to be really doing it twice.

1459
00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:51.530
I supposed to be fantastic.

1460
00:41:52.270 --> 00:41:53.103
It sounds exciting.

1461
00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:54.133
I can't wait.

1462
00:41:54.170 --> 00:41:56.120
Do you do anything specifically?

1463
00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:56.540
Um,

1464
00:41:56.540 --> 00:41:57.620
like post workout?

1465
00:41:57.621 --> 00:42:01.100
Do you have like a routine that you do per post workout to reduce inflammation

1466
00:42:01.101 --> 00:42:01.930
or anything?

1467
00:42:01.930 --> 00:42:02.231
<v 1>Well,</v>

1468
00:42:02.231 --> 00:42:03.460
one of the things I do if I run,

1469
00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:04.420
and uh,

1470
00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:07.840
I read this in a book and I thought it was ingenious as a,

1471
00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:10.120
just lay on my back and put my legs up against a wall.

1472
00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:10.901
Oh.

1473
00:42:10.901 --> 00:42:12.580
Just to like let the blood flow down,

1474
00:42:12.581 --> 00:42:13.414
blood drain.

1475
00:42:13.630 --> 00:42:14.320
That makes sense.

1476
00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:14.981
Because you know,

1477
00:42:14.981 --> 00:42:18.640
a lot of times after your run you just sit down and hold off your something.

1478
00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:19.180
Yeah.

1479
00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:19.451
Cool.

1480
00:42:19.451 --> 00:42:22.740
And it just pulls and then I stand all day at work and uh,

1481
00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:25.120
it's hard for that blood to get back to the heart,

1482
00:42:25.121 --> 00:42:28.300
especially when there's all that inflammation in the legs and all that heat

1483
00:42:28.301 --> 00:42:31.180
created and all the blood just bashing down into there.

1484
00:42:31.810 --> 00:42:32.111
Uh,

1485
00:42:32.111 --> 00:42:32.621
so yeah,

1486
00:42:32.621 --> 00:42:33.340
it's uh,

1487
00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:33.850
it,

1488
00:42:33.850 --> 00:42:36.370
it makes a huge difference for your legs.

1489
00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:41.160
<v 2>Do you work out with a trainer or do you concoct your own workouts and just are</v>

1490
00:42:41.161 --> 00:42:42.060
self motivated?

1491
00:42:42.350 --> 00:42:42.540
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1492
00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:42.980
I,

1493
00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:44.860
I dream up different.

1494
00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.900
Like my body is my own experiment and uh,

1495
00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:50.743
sorry

1496
00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:54.980
I didn't come out right,

1497
00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:55.813
but uh,

1498
00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:56.471
but it is that,

1499
00:42:56.471 --> 00:42:56.691
you know,

1500
00:42:56.691 --> 00:43:01.310
it's my body and I can see what it's capable of handling and uh,

1501
00:43:01.850 --> 00:43:02.860
it's fun to do.

1502
00:43:02.861 --> 00:43:05.900
There's so much information out there and so many cool things to try.

1503
00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:06.651
Uh,

1504
00:43:06.651 --> 00:43:09.590
but I do come back to the kettlebell training is kind of,

1505
00:43:10.010 --> 00:43:15.010
to me that feels like the hardest weight training type conditioning exercises

1506
00:43:15.111 --> 00:43:15.861
than I've found.

1507
00:43:15.861 --> 00:43:16.340
It's,

1508
00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:17.750
and it's just so convenient.

1509
00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:18.300
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

1510
00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:18.511
no,

1511
00:43:18.511 --> 00:43:19.290
I agree.

1512
00:43:19.290 --> 00:43:22.980
I just love the fact that you can get so much out of one piece of equipment.

1513
00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:23.551
You know,

1514
00:43:23.551 --> 00:43:28.440
with one 50 pound kettle bell you can have an unbelievable ball busting workout

1515
00:43:28.441 --> 00:43:32.940
and your whole body be ridiculously sore and all functional strength.

1516
00:43:32.941 --> 00:43:36.870
Like I love Turkish getups things along those lines because they're not

1517
00:43:36.871 --> 00:43:38.100
glamorous exercises.

1518
00:43:38.101 --> 00:43:40.050
But if you do them consistently,

1519
00:43:40.051 --> 00:43:42.000
like you feel like a difference.

1520
00:43:42.001 --> 00:43:43.740
If you go to help a friend move a couch,

1521
00:43:43.950 --> 00:43:44.820
like you feel it,

1522
00:43:44.850 --> 00:43:47.160
you feel like you can physically carry things better.

1523
00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:47.941
Like I said,

1524
00:43:47.941 --> 00:43:52.920
I was hunting in Alaska this week and I had a big pack on my back and I'm

1525
00:43:52.921 --> 00:43:54.780
climbing up hills and I felt great.

1526
00:43:54.810 --> 00:43:55.621
I'm in good shape.

1527
00:43:55.621 --> 00:43:55.861
I mean,

1528
00:43:55.861 --> 00:43:59.870
I'm going up these ridiculously tough hills and sliding around the dirt and

1529
00:43:59.871 --> 00:44:02.940
everything and it's a lot of like lifting yourself up with one leg and then

1530
00:44:02.941 --> 00:44:04.620
lifting yourself up with the and the other leg.

1531
00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:08.830
So it really is consistent with like the workouts that you create in,

1532
00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:09.301
in your,

1533
00:44:09.301 --> 00:44:10.134
in your videos.

1534
00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:11.350
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1535
00:44:11.350 --> 00:44:11.660
You know,

1536
00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:11.990
that's,

1537
00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:12.771
that's a good point.

1538
00:44:12.771 --> 00:44:13.200
And it's,

1539
00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:13.740
uh,

1540
00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:14.361
I do,

1541
00:44:14.361 --> 00:44:15.350
I love the Turkish get up.

1542
00:44:15.351 --> 00:44:17.270
So many people don't like that exercise,

1543
00:44:17.271 --> 00:44:18.950
but this is not glamorous.

1544
00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:19.431
Yeah.

1545
00:44:19.431 --> 00:44:19.791
And it's,

1546
00:44:19.791 --> 00:44:20.451
it is hard.

1547
00:44:20.451 --> 00:44:20.841
You have to,

1548
00:44:20.841 --> 00:44:23.410
you can't watch TV while you're doing it right.

1549
00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:25.160
But I go skiing,

1550
00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:30.170
we go skiing in the winter and the most fun thing to do is climb up these huge

1551
00:44:30.870 --> 00:44:32.100
trails that people make.

1552
00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:34.290
<v 3>They take their skis off and climb up to,</v>

1553
00:44:34.291 --> 00:44:35.130
not out of bounds,

1554
00:44:35.131 --> 00:44:38.070
but this one hill we go to is like,

1555
00:44:38.071 --> 00:44:38.281
there's,

1556
00:44:38.281 --> 00:44:39.810
it's like the stair climber from hell,

1557
00:44:39.811 --> 00:44:39.991
Hey,

1558
00:44:39.991 --> 00:44:43.020
the oxygen's a bit thinner and you've got to get your,

1559
00:44:43.110 --> 00:44:45.930
you've got this stupid ski boot on so you can't flex your ankle.

1560
00:44:45.931 --> 00:44:48.060
So you're just going one after the other,

1561
00:44:48.090 --> 00:44:49.380
straight up these hills.

1562
00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:50.371
And exactly.

1563
00:44:50.371 --> 00:44:51.150
It's just like getting up.

1564
00:44:51.150 --> 00:44:51.341
You're,

1565
00:44:51.341 --> 00:44:52.051
you're used to it.

1566
00:44:52.051 --> 00:44:53.580
It's like getting up from the Turkish getup,

1567
00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:56.280
except you don't have to hold the weight above your head.

1568
00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:01.470
I just think that it's one of the best exercises for like translating into like

1569
00:45:01.471 --> 00:45:02.910
using your body in everyday life.

1570
00:45:02.911 --> 00:45:06.180
If you have to pick things up or move things or just be strong,

1571
00:45:06.181 --> 00:45:07.320
like have your body like,

1572
00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:07.891
oh,

1573
00:45:07.891 --> 00:45:08.161
you know,

1574
00:45:08.161 --> 00:45:10.500
it doesn't bother me if I have to move these boxes right now.

1575
00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:11.940
I could pick the cause like,

1576
00:45:12.310 --> 00:45:12.870
um,

1577
00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:14.010
like Ben from a hunting,

1578
00:45:14.011 --> 00:45:14.340
hunting.

1579
00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:14.620
Yeah.

1580
00:45:14.620 --> 00:45:15.630
We're talking to him.

1581
00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:16.513
Uh,

1582
00:45:16.890 --> 00:45:18.420
our friend from a band,

1583
00:45:18.421 --> 00:45:21.600
honey honey yesterday was talking about how they're on the road all the time and

1584
00:45:21.601 --> 00:45:23.580
he hurt his back from just carrying,

1585
00:45:23.610 --> 00:45:24.660
he's like carrying their,

1586
00:45:24.661 --> 00:45:25.560
get their gear,

1587
00:45:25.770 --> 00:45:27.780
just picking things up and carrying their gear.

1588
00:45:27.781 --> 00:45:30.840
Like just things along like everybody thinks of,

1589
00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:35.880
there's a lot of like vanity and ego associated with exercise.

1590
00:45:36.090 --> 00:45:38.920
Like if you look at the cover of all these magazines and dudes are all sleek and

1591
00:45:38.930 --> 00:45:39.511
six pack,

1592
00:45:39.511 --> 00:45:39.751
you're like,

1593
00:45:39.751 --> 00:45:40.620
fuck that Douche.

1594
00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:41.910
I don't even want to be that guy.

1595
00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:42.660
I hate when they,

1596
00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:45.870
they black them out or when they airbrush them.

1597
00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:47.580
That's the worst bothered the Bosnian.

1598
00:45:47.850 --> 00:45:48.510
Yeah.

1599
00:45:48.510 --> 00:45:50.220
It's just so fake.

1600
00:45:50.250 --> 00:45:50.780
Fake.

1601
00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:51.780
It's fake fuckers.

1602
00:45:52.830 --> 00:45:54.600
Well there's a lot of people that actually do look that way.

1603
00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:54.841
Right.

1604
00:45:54.841 --> 00:45:58.510
But that's the thing like for what you were talking about your friend that that

1605
00:45:58.530 --> 00:46:02.070
cuts weight and they dehydrate themselves before they take those photographs.

1606
00:46:02.310 --> 00:46:04.800
That's something that most people are probably not aware of.

1607
00:46:04.801 --> 00:46:07.980
When you look at those magazines and you see someone that's unbelievably

1608
00:46:07.981 --> 00:46:10.770
shredded and vascular and really thin skinned,

1609
00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:14.340
they're dehydrated and they're super unhealthy and they're like,

1610
00:46:14.341 --> 00:46:15.870
you can't stay like that either.

1611
00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:20.670
Like that state that they reach like contest wait state like right before they

1612
00:46:20.671 --> 00:46:22.200
compete in bodybuilding competitions.

1613
00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:23.490
They're like on death's door.

1614
00:46:23.730 --> 00:46:27.660
Those fuckers are like literally ready to die but it looks awesome.

1615
00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:29.880
Why does it look good to be almost dying?

1616
00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:31.970
I just think we,

1617
00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:36.610
we like that look of just solid muscle and just shred it.

1618
00:46:37.340 --> 00:46:38.610
Fucking tried to act.

1619
00:46:40.410 --> 00:46:40.750
Yeah.

1620
00:46:40.750 --> 00:46:41.610
Little Fat's good though,

1621
00:46:41.611 --> 00:46:42.390
right?

1622
00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:43.100
I think it is.

1623
00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:43.620
Yeah.

1624
00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:44.880
Good for your endurance it seems.

1625
00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:45.710
Yup.

1626
00:46:45.710 --> 00:46:47.910
Cause guys who were like super lean and shredded,

1627
00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:50.820
they don't seem to have as much endurance as guys who just have a clutch,

1628
00:46:50.830 --> 00:46:53.700
just a small layer of body fat on them.

1629
00:46:54.450 --> 00:46:56.010
Does your body actually burned fat?

1630
00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:57.270
Like if you're in a competition,

1631
00:46:57.990 --> 00:46:59.940
like say if you're doing something like a marathon,

1632
00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:01.500
is your body burning fat?

1633
00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:03.450
Are you basing,

1634
00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:06.930
is it going entirely on glycogen and food?

1635
00:47:06.931 --> 00:47:07.860
And like what is,

1636
00:47:08.130 --> 00:47:09.330
have you ever read the book eat,

1637
00:47:09.331 --> 00:47:09.601
stop,

1638
00:47:09.601 --> 00:47:10.100
eat.

1639
00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:10.980
All right that much.

1640
00:47:11.490 --> 00:47:11.851
Oh yeah,

1641
00:47:11.851 --> 00:47:12.900
you're too busy to read.

1642
00:47:12.990 --> 00:47:16.470
I read but I read shit on like space things that will never affect me.

1643
00:47:16.530 --> 00:47:17.580
I'll summarize it for you

1644
00:47:19.270 --> 00:47:20.760
cause it's,

1645
00:47:20.761 --> 00:47:21.594
um,

1646
00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:23.610
the best book I've ever read on eating.

1647
00:47:23.940 --> 00:47:24.240
Eat,

1648
00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:24.421
eat,

1649
00:47:24.421 --> 00:47:24.691
stop,

1650
00:47:24.691 --> 00:47:25.530
eat it,

1651
00:47:25.531 --> 00:47:25.681
eat,

1652
00:47:25.681 --> 00:47:25.951
stop,

1653
00:47:25.951 --> 00:47:26.784
eat.com.

1654
00:47:27.170 --> 00:47:27.331
Uh,

1655
00:47:27.331 --> 00:47:28.380
and I just found it,

1656
00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:29.530
I don't know how I found it,

1657
00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:30.393
but uh,

1658
00:47:30.770 --> 00:47:31.571
<v 1>it's just,</v>

1659
00:47:31.571 --> 00:47:32.050
uh,

1660
00:47:32.050 --> 00:47:33.250
it's like a ebook,

1661
00:47:33.251 --> 00:47:37.420
maybe a hundred pages and it's based on 261 research papers.

1662
00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:38.200
Uh,

1663
00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:38.531
anyway,

1664
00:47:38.531 --> 00:47:39.190
this guy,

1665
00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:40.090
Brad Pilon,

1666
00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:40.841
uh,

1667
00:47:40.841 --> 00:47:44.650
he worked in the supplement industry and he started wondering what the,

1668
00:47:44.651 --> 00:47:45.700
and his p Long P,

1669
00:47:45.701 --> 00:47:45.911
I,

1670
00:47:45.911 --> 00:47:46.151
l,

1671
00:47:46.151 --> 00:47:47.710
O n and he,

1672
00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:51.510
I think he started questioning the wisdom of six meals a day.

1673
00:47:51.511 --> 00:47:52.780
Do we really need six meals a day?

1674
00:47:52.781 --> 00:47:53.920
Does the body really,

1675
00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:54.910
uh,

1676
00:47:54.910 --> 00:47:55.181
you know,

1677
00:47:55.181 --> 00:47:55.571
a CAC,

1678
00:47:55.571 --> 00:48:00.300
its own muscle tissue if you're not constantly like full and uh,

1679
00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:03.220
and like his fasting really that bad.

1680
00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:04.240
So He's,

1681
00:48:04.270 --> 00:48:06.190
he looked at all these different studies on

1682
00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:12.720
the effects of fasting and it turns out you can not eat any calories for 16

1683
00:48:14.411 --> 00:48:15.970
hours before your,

1684
00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:19.900
your blood sugar levels even start to be affected.

1685
00:48:19.901 --> 00:48:21.330
You've got that much glycogen,

1686
00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:22.180
16 hours,

1687
00:48:22.181 --> 00:48:23.014
10 hours.

1688
00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:25.390
So you think it's like mental for a lot of people.

1689
00:48:25.710 --> 00:48:25.980
Uh,

1690
00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:27.010
I think it's mantle.

1691
00:48:27.011 --> 00:48:29.950
I think once your stomach is empty,

1692
00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:30.880
uh,

1693
00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:34.480
it's such a weird feeling for so many people that they almost freak out.

1694
00:48:34.810 --> 00:48:35.231
And,

1695
00:48:35.231 --> 00:48:36.064
uh,

1696
00:48:36.460 --> 00:48:41.460
so the premise of the book is too fast for up to 24 hours once or twice a week.

1697
00:48:44.290 --> 00:48:45.123
Um,

1698
00:48:45.730 --> 00:48:46.563
and uh,

1699
00:48:46.630 --> 00:48:46.841
yeah,

1700
00:48:46.841 --> 00:48:47.950
just don't eat anything.

1701
00:48:47.951 --> 00:48:48.731
You can drink tea,

1702
00:48:48.731 --> 00:48:49.840
you can drink coffee,

1703
00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:51.430
nothing with calories and it and get,

1704
00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:53.890
get down to that last eight hours of the,

1705
00:48:53.891 --> 00:48:54.640
uh,

1706
00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:57.100
the fast that lasts between 16 and 24.

1707
00:48:57.101 --> 00:48:57.970
That's the sweet spot.

1708
00:48:57.971 --> 00:48:59.380
That's where the magic happens.

1709
00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:00.393
What magic?

1710
00:49:00.490 --> 00:49:04.870
Well that's where your insulin levels are like down to the bottom and your body

1711
00:49:04.871 --> 00:49:05.170
says,

1712
00:49:05.170 --> 00:49:05.820
oh my God,

1713
00:49:05.820 --> 00:49:06.010
look,

1714
00:49:06.010 --> 00:49:06.790
there's no,

1715
00:49:06.790 --> 00:49:08.860
there's no blood sugar left in our muscles and liver.

1716
00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:10.240
We better start burning fat.

1717
00:49:10.570 --> 00:49:10.811
Wow.

1718
00:49:10.811 --> 00:49:14.170
What a new concept because a lot of people haven't gotten to that,

1719
00:49:14.380 --> 00:49:19.240
that hunger stage where their bodies have actually been forced to access fat

1720
00:49:19.241 --> 00:49:20.074
stores.

1721
00:49:20.290 --> 00:49:25.290
So for so for is it the average person has that many hours of,

1722
00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:26.100
of showing.

1723
00:49:26.100 --> 00:49:27.490
I think that's based on average.

1724
00:49:27.491 --> 00:49:27.761
I know,

1725
00:49:27.761 --> 00:49:28.690
cause I wondered that too.

1726
00:49:28.691 --> 00:49:29.524
I'm like,

1727
00:49:29.710 --> 00:49:32.140
it seems kind of like a cut and dried number,

1728
00:49:32.141 --> 00:49:34.120
but as soon as that good for you to do that.

1729
00:49:34.210 --> 00:49:34.940
Very good.

1730
00:49:34.940 --> 00:49:35.310
Really?

1731
00:49:35.310 --> 00:49:36.100
Yeah.

1732
00:49:36.100 --> 00:49:38.380
And he's a lot of controversy when it comes to that though,

1733
00:49:38.381 --> 00:49:38.710
isn't it?

1734
00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:39.400
There is,

1735
00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:40.960
but he proves it like the book.

1736
00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:41.853
Honestly,

1737
00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:43.870
I couldn't put it down because everything,

1738
00:49:43.871 --> 00:49:48.340
every sentence he writes is backed up with a study and it turns out and he's got

1739
00:49:48.341 --> 00:49:49.720
charts and graphs and everything,

1740
00:49:50.050 --> 00:49:52.030
but when you get your insulin down to that level,

1741
00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:56.470
your growth hormone levels are inversely proportional to hear insulin levels.

1742
00:49:56.471 --> 00:49:58.780
So you actually get a surge of growth hormone.

1743
00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:00.890
So the how weird your,

1744
00:50:00.900 --> 00:50:05.900
your body makes more growth hormone if your body is starving because it's

1745
00:50:06.431 --> 00:50:06.970
stress.

1746
00:50:06.970 --> 00:50:08.170
I think it's under stress.

1747
00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:09.153
Huh?

1748
00:50:09.220 --> 00:50:12.730
And supposedly that's why we get a little spike of growth hormone in the middle

1749
00:50:12.730 --> 00:50:14.710
of the night because presumably if we've eaten,

1750
00:50:14.711 --> 00:50:15.700
suffered a certain hour,

1751
00:50:15.701 --> 00:50:18.190
by the time the middle of the night rolls around,

1752
00:50:18.730 --> 00:50:22.600
we've dipped our blood sugar down a little bit compared to what we were after.

1753
00:50:22.601 --> 00:50:24.040
We ate like four hours after.

1754
00:50:24.550 --> 00:50:26.410
And the growth hormone has a bit of a pump.

1755
00:50:26.530 --> 00:50:27.530
Is that where you're supposed to eat?

1756
00:50:27.531 --> 00:50:27.980
Like a fat

1757
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:29.030
<v 2>pig right before you go to sleep?</v>

1758
00:50:29.031 --> 00:50:29.864
Yeah.

1759
00:50:29.910 --> 00:50:30.080
Yeah,

1760
00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:31.120
because then you're sleeping,

1761
00:50:31.150 --> 00:50:32.330
burning off while you're sleeping.

1762
00:50:32.690 --> 00:50:34.190
So how often do you fast?

1763
00:50:34.610 --> 00:50:35.570
I try for once a week,

1764
00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:36.583
once a week.

1765
00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:37.790
And how many hours do you do?

1766
00:50:38.060 --> 00:50:40.300
Just 24 you just do a full day once a week.

1767
00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:44.660
And he says that anything more than 24 is not that beneficial.

1768
00:50:44.661 --> 00:50:47.240
You've kind of maxed out the benefits around the 24 hour mark.

1769
00:50:47.420 --> 00:50:50.240
So when you come back after the 24 hour fast,

1770
00:50:50.241 --> 00:50:54.190
you slowly consumed food or do you have very specific foods that you consume

1771
00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:57.350
that you almost are forced to slowly consumed?

1772
00:50:58.040 --> 00:51:01.370
You're so sensitive to food and it's not even that long of a time,

1773
00:51:01.371 --> 00:51:04.700
but you like a piece of lettuce tastes good.

1774
00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:05.593
And uh,

1775
00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:06.081
you know,

1776
00:51:06.081 --> 00:51:07.130
like you drink a,

1777
00:51:07.580 --> 00:51:08.780
maybe a smoothie or something,

1778
00:51:08.781 --> 00:51:09.020
it's like,

1779
00:51:09.020 --> 00:51:09.651
oh my God,

1780
00:51:09.651 --> 00:51:10.280
I'm full.

1781
00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:11.113
It's incredible.

1782
00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:13.850
So your stomach is just like super sensitive to it.

1783
00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:14.960
Hmm.

1784
00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:15.261
You know,

1785
00:51:15.261 --> 00:51:16.430
animals like bears,

1786
00:51:16.431 --> 00:51:18.680
when they go into hibernation and they come out,

1787
00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:19.910
they really can't eat much.

1788
00:51:19.940 --> 00:51:21.620
They have to slowly work their way up.

1789
00:51:21.980 --> 00:51:23.150
It's kind of a crazy thing.

1790
00:51:23.151 --> 00:51:24.200
But grizzly bears,

1791
00:51:24.201 --> 00:51:25.640
when they come out of hibernation,

1792
00:51:25.641 --> 00:51:28.610
they kill things on instinct and just leave them there.

1793
00:51:29.150 --> 00:51:30.170
Because a lot of grizzlies,

1794
00:51:30.171 --> 00:51:31.850
when they come out of hibernation in the spring,

1795
00:51:31.851 --> 00:51:36.710
there's still snow on the ground and Moose gets stuck in the snow to the point

1796
00:51:36.711 --> 00:51:40.580
where they can't run away from the grizzlies because they're huge animals.

1797
00:51:40.610 --> 00:51:42.170
And the snow is oftentimes five,

1798
00:51:42.171 --> 00:51:42.950
six foot thick.

1799
00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:43.761
And I don't have to tell you,

1800
00:51:43.761 --> 00:51:47.720
you live in Alberta and as they're walking like they're fucking sinking all the

1801
00:51:47.721 --> 00:51:48.261
way to the bottom.

1802
00:51:48.261 --> 00:51:52.220
This smells like a moose can't sprint in seven foot deep snow.

1803
00:51:52.370 --> 00:51:53.540
They're really kind of fucked.

1804
00:51:53.570 --> 00:51:54.590
They're sitting ducks.

1805
00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:59.330
And so these bears come out of these holes and they see these moves just kind of

1806
00:51:59.331 --> 00:52:02.030
trudging and they just run up to him and fuck him up.

1807
00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:03.260
And uh,

1808
00:52:03.260 --> 00:52:08.260
my friend Cameron was up in Alaska and he said he saw his one bear had killed

1809
00:52:08.690 --> 00:52:12.140
like several moose and couldn't eat them yet cause he couldn't,

1810
00:52:12.141 --> 00:52:13.790
like he'd just come out of hibernation.

1811
00:52:13.940 --> 00:52:14.651
So he didn't need,

1812
00:52:14.651 --> 00:52:17.330
literally didn't have the ability to eat meat yet,

1813
00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:18.830
but he was just killing anyway.

1814
00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:21.910
Killed a bunch of Moose and just leave them all fucked up and the smell,

1815
00:52:21.940 --> 00:52:22.660
even my nice.

1816
00:52:22.660 --> 00:52:22.880
Really?

1817
00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:23.210
Yeah,

1818
00:52:23.210 --> 00:52:23.990
like literally.

1819
00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:24.800
Yeah.

1820
00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:25.101
Yeah.

1821
00:52:25.101 --> 00:52:26.510
It's amazing how nature works.

1822
00:52:27.560 --> 00:52:29.780
It's strange how nature works as far as like,

1823
00:52:29.990 --> 00:52:30.823
you know,

1824
00:52:30.890 --> 00:52:35.690
reacting to what you're putting into your body as far as like you're burning off

1825
00:52:35.691 --> 00:52:39.230
sugars because you're consuming a lot of sugars and then you stop that and you

1826
00:52:39.231 --> 00:52:43.040
give yourself only like complex carbohydrates,

1827
00:52:43.550 --> 00:52:44.540
vegetables,

1828
00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:45.650
proteins in your body goes,

1829
00:52:45.651 --> 00:52:45.721
whoa,

1830
00:52:45.721 --> 00:52:45.891
whoa,

1831
00:52:45.891 --> 00:52:46.040
whoa.

1832
00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:46.670
Where's the sugar?

1833
00:52:46.670 --> 00:52:47.290
Where's your sugar?

1834
00:52:47.290 --> 00:52:47.740
Alright,

1835
00:52:47.740 --> 00:52:48.320
okay.

1836
00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:49.220
Change the script.

1837
00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:50.233
We're going to burn fat.

1838
00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:51.440
And that's,

1839
00:52:51.630 --> 00:52:52.463
you know what,

1840
00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:57.480
the Paleo has kind of a bad rap because it's sort of been proven that people

1841
00:52:57.951 --> 00:53:01.040
that lived in the Paleolithic era didn't necessarily eat that and they probably

1842
00:53:01.041 --> 00:53:04.520
did eat some grains and they probably did eat anything in the fucking they can

1843
00:53:04.521 --> 00:53:05.354
get their hands on.

1844
00:53:05.810 --> 00:53:08.360
But the reality being that simple sugars,

1845
00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:09.980
whether it's a lot of pasta,

1846
00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:11.150
a lot of bread,

1847
00:53:11.180 --> 00:53:12.013
cake,

1848
00:53:12.170 --> 00:53:15.470
those things are not necessarily the best thing for your body.

1849
00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:17.240
And it's basically sugar.

1850
00:53:18.050 --> 00:53:19.700
When you eat a piece of bread and you say,

1851
00:53:19.730 --> 00:53:19.831
Oh,

1852
00:53:19.831 --> 00:53:20.690
I'm going to have a piece of bread,

1853
00:53:20.930 --> 00:53:22.010
you're eating sugar,

1854
00:53:22.670 --> 00:53:23.900
your body processes,

1855
00:53:23.901 --> 00:53:25.770
it does almost the way as it would

1856
00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:27.330
<v 3>process a simple sugar.</v>

1857
00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:28.050
Yeah.

1858
00:53:28.050 --> 00:53:29.940
We don't have cereal,

1859
00:53:30.150 --> 00:53:30.983
bread,

1860
00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:32.460
pasta,

1861
00:53:32.460 --> 00:53:32.940
rice,

1862
00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:34.200
any of that stuff in our house.

1863
00:53:34.780 --> 00:53:36.660
What he rice eat a little bit of rice.

1864
00:53:36.661 --> 00:53:37.494
Wild Rice.

1865
00:53:37.580 --> 00:53:38.370
Yup.

1866
00:53:38.370 --> 00:53:41.640
Keen you you're have one was great.

1867
00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:42.020
Yeah.

1868
00:53:42.020 --> 00:53:46.290
So this is one of the few complex proteins like in plant form to where it has

1869
00:53:46.291 --> 00:53:48.360
basically all the amino acids and it was a seed,

1870
00:53:48.361 --> 00:53:49.194
right?

1871
00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:49.920
It's green.

1872
00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:50.680
We're green.

1873
00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:50.960
Yeah.

1874
00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:51.290
No.

1875
00:53:51.290 --> 00:53:53.070
And bread is one of the things that my,

1876
00:53:53.410 --> 00:53:54.930
and my wife is great with Diet.

1877
00:53:54.931 --> 00:53:56.070
She's very strict,

1878
00:53:56.071 --> 00:53:56.910
very disciplined.

1879
00:53:56.940 --> 00:53:57.773
And uh,

1880
00:53:58.170 --> 00:53:59.400
so when I look at a piece of bread,

1881
00:53:59.490 --> 00:54:00.990
it's like if I'm going to eat that,

1882
00:54:00.991 --> 00:54:01.800
that's a treat.

1883
00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:04.320
Like it's Kinda like having a piece of birthday cake or something.

1884
00:54:04.321 --> 00:54:05.154
It's really,

1885
00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:05.731
yeah.

1886
00:54:05.731 --> 00:54:05.881
Like,

1887
00:54:05.881 --> 00:54:07.320
if I go out for dinner or something,

1888
00:54:07.380 --> 00:54:08.130
it's a,

1889
00:54:08.130 --> 00:54:09.120
I'm going to have a piece of bread.

1890
00:54:09.121 --> 00:54:09.901
It's so exciting,

1891
00:54:09.901 --> 00:54:10.420
you know,

1892
00:54:10.420 --> 00:54:13.200
where's the most people eat that kind of stuff.

1893
00:54:13.230 --> 00:54:14.340
They think they're healthy and they,

1894
00:54:14.341 --> 00:54:14.700
cause I'm,

1895
00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:15.990
they're eating whole grain bread.

1896
00:54:16.220 --> 00:54:17.010
Yeah.

1897
00:54:17.010 --> 00:54:17.790
I don't,

1898
00:54:17.790 --> 00:54:18.330
it's,

1899
00:54:18.330 --> 00:54:20.400
it's a fascinating subject.

1900
00:54:20.401 --> 00:54:21.630
The subject of Diet.

1901
00:54:22.070 --> 00:54:22.890
It's really,

1902
00:54:22.890 --> 00:54:23.430
it's,

1903
00:54:23.430 --> 00:54:25.230
you are what you eat.

1904
00:54:25.231 --> 00:54:27.420
And that's such a stupid cliche for me to say,

1905
00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:29.430
but because it's been said so many times,

1906
00:54:29.431 --> 00:54:30.264
it's painful,

1907
00:54:30.270 --> 00:54:31.290
but it really is what it is.

1908
00:54:31.291 --> 00:54:31.920
Have you seen,

1909
00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:32.580
uh,

1910
00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:33.270
king corn?

1911
00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:34.103
Yes.

1912
00:54:34.110 --> 00:54:36.090
I mean that just proves that the guy was what he ate.

1913
00:54:36.091 --> 00:54:36.361
They were,

1914
00:54:36.361 --> 00:54:38.880
and they were made of their DNA was made of corn and yeah,

1915
00:54:38.890 --> 00:54:42.720
the carbon was based on corn when they did an analysis of their hair.

1916
00:54:43.050 --> 00:54:43.883
Um,

1917
00:54:44.340 --> 00:54:48.450
I love that documentary because these guys went into it pretty,

1918
00:54:48.540 --> 00:54:48.931
pretty,

1919
00:54:48.931 --> 00:54:49.470
you know,

1920
00:54:49.470 --> 00:54:50.221
they weren't aware.

1921
00:54:50.221 --> 00:54:52.230
They didn't really know what corn.

1922
00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:52.711
Okay,

1923
00:54:52.711 --> 00:54:53.970
let's find out what this is all about.

1924
00:54:54.210 --> 00:54:56.810
They bought an acre of corn or least an acre of corn.

1925
00:54:56.820 --> 00:54:57.653
This guy's farm,

1926
00:54:57.900 --> 00:55:01.800
grew it and watch the whole thing from putting the corn to the ground to

1927
00:55:01.801 --> 00:55:05.100
harvesting it and selling it and seeing where it goes after it's sold.

1928
00:55:05.310 --> 00:55:10.310
Amazing documentary and a stunning analysis of like where our culture is right

1929
00:55:11.971 --> 00:55:16.260
now when it comes to farm subsidies and how it affects every human being on this

1930
00:55:16.261 --> 00:55:16.711
planet.

1931
00:55:16.711 --> 00:55:20.790
And when they go to the supermarket and start finding all the different corn

1932
00:55:20.791 --> 00:55:23.580
ingredients that are on all these different products,

1933
00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:27.810
corn proteins and corn syrup and corn flour and corn,

1934
00:55:27.811 --> 00:55:28.630
this and that.

1935
00:55:28.630 --> 00:55:29.310
And like,

1936
00:55:29.310 --> 00:55:30.360
fuck yeah,

1937
00:55:31.050 --> 00:55:31.261
yeah.

1938
00:55:31.261 --> 00:55:34.420
Unless you're eating purely whole foods,

1939
00:55:34.950 --> 00:55:39.060
you're going to be eating corn and corn is not good.

1940
00:55:39.270 --> 00:55:41.180
Like your body doesn't digest Cornwell.

1941
00:55:41.190 --> 00:55:43.410
That's why you find corn kernels and your shit.

1942
00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:44.873
You know?

1943
00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:45.631
That's like,

1944
00:55:45.631 --> 00:55:46.680
it's really that simple.

1945
00:55:46.990 --> 00:55:48.120
And why is that in there?

1946
00:55:48.121 --> 00:55:49.530
Because your body didn't digest it.

1947
00:55:49.830 --> 00:55:50.401
Your body's like,

1948
00:55:50.401 --> 00:55:52.830
what is this your body like?

1949
00:55:52.831 --> 00:55:55.380
Basically spits it out the way it went in.

1950
00:55:55.690 --> 00:55:58.860
You swallow a kernel of corn or it'll come out like a marble,

1951
00:55:59.190 --> 00:55:59.640
you know?

1952
00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:00.840
I mean that's really,

1953
00:56:02.130 --> 00:56:03.480
that's your body telling you something.

1954
00:56:03.510 --> 00:56:03.900
Hey,

1955
00:56:03.900 --> 00:56:04.320
we're not,

1956
00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:05.010
this isn't,

1957
00:56:05.010 --> 00:56:05.843
what is this?

1958
00:56:06.380 --> 00:56:07.310
I don't even know what to do with it.

1959
00:56:07.350 --> 00:56:10.560
I'm wondering about that because you know corn on the cob and the summer,

1960
00:56:10.590 --> 00:56:12.960
I don't eat it anymore because it is so disgusting.

1961
00:56:13.610 --> 00:56:14.443
How dare you.

1962
00:56:14.570 --> 00:56:15.450
You put butter on it,

1963
00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:18.090
but you don't make comp gets buttered.

1964
00:56:18.130 --> 00:56:18.410
Damn.

1965
00:56:18.410 --> 00:56:19.110
It's so good.

1966
00:56:19.110 --> 00:56:20.610
It's a butter that makes things taste good.

1967
00:56:20.611 --> 00:56:22.160
We were in Costa Rica last.

1968
00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:23.890
You don't eat a stick of butter by itself.

1969
00:56:23.891 --> 00:56:24.724
Tastes like shit.

1970
00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:26.410
You know I don't buy that.

1971
00:56:26.411 --> 00:56:27.850
I think it's the butter on the corn.

1972
00:56:28.450 --> 00:56:28.721
Well,

1973
00:56:28.721 --> 00:56:29.554
if it's melted,

1974
00:56:29.990 --> 00:56:31.390
you dip something into it that would,

1975
00:56:31.391 --> 00:56:32.770
otherwise it helps lobster.

1976
00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:33.941
Yeah.

1977
00:56:33.941 --> 00:56:34.700
I hadn't lobster.

1978
00:56:34.700 --> 00:56:36.130
I had steak and lobster for Christmas.

1979
00:56:36.131 --> 00:56:39.430
We were on holidays and in Costa Rica they don't,

1980
00:56:40.030 --> 00:56:40.880
they don't butters.

1981
00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:41.800
Pretty precious there.

1982
00:56:41.801 --> 00:56:43.030
They don't give that stuff out.

1983
00:56:43.180 --> 00:56:44.410
They don't just turn the butter out.

1984
00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:44.820
Yeah.

1985
00:56:44.820 --> 00:56:46.150
So I had this steak in lifetime.

1986
00:56:46.180 --> 00:56:46.931
It treat myself.

1987
00:56:46.931 --> 00:56:50.110
It's Christmas dinner and they didn't bring me butter and I said,

1988
00:56:51.250 --> 00:56:52.840
sorry to be a pain in the ass,

1989
00:56:52.841 --> 00:56:54.730
but can I get some butter with the lobster?

1990
00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:55.540
They were like,

1991
00:56:55.540 --> 00:56:58.270
they looked at me like of this third world people.

1992
00:56:58.450 --> 00:57:00.790
That's why they don't have nuclear weapons because I don't even know what

1993
00:57:00.791 --> 00:57:01.620
they're doing.

1994
00:57:01.620 --> 00:57:02.620
We won't let them have it.

1995
00:57:03.010 --> 00:57:04.300
Can't even handle buttery flux.

1996
00:57:04.630 --> 00:57:05.860
That's why you go up to Maine.

1997
00:57:05.861 --> 00:57:06.730
If you want lobster,

1998
00:57:06.790 --> 00:57:08.230
that's where they make a real lobster.

1999
00:57:08.290 --> 00:57:09.580
Goddamn American lobster,

2000
00:57:09.581 --> 00:57:11.050
not just Costa Rican bullshit.

2001
00:57:11.260 --> 00:57:12.190
They don't even have claws.

2002
00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:13.600
This is unarmed pussy,

2003
00:57:13.601 --> 00:57:14.434
lobsters,

2004
00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:14.741
peace,

2005
00:57:14.741 --> 00:57:15.580
love and lobsters.

2006
00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:16.780
You go to Maine,

2007
00:57:16.870 --> 00:57:18.460
you get those cold water lobsters.

2008
00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:19.031
Oh,

2009
00:57:19.031 --> 00:57:20.080
that's the real lobster.

2010
00:57:20.081 --> 00:57:21.540
My friend that's,

2011
00:57:21.570 --> 00:57:23.680
they fly Maine lobsters all over the country.

2012
00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:24.753
You know.

2013
00:57:25.090 --> 00:57:25.511
Fuck yeah,

2014
00:57:25.511 --> 00:57:26.170
they do.

2015
00:57:26.170 --> 00:57:26.321
Yeah.

2016
00:57:26.321 --> 00:57:27.154
You don't want those.

2017
00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:28.810
They have California lobsters.

2018
00:57:28.930 --> 00:57:30.160
Like if you go to Malibu,

2019
00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:30.461
uh,

2020
00:57:30.461 --> 00:57:31.211
off the coast,

2021
00:57:31.211 --> 00:57:32.830
you'll see people right now,

2022
00:57:32.950 --> 00:57:34.150
cause it's lobster season.

2023
00:57:34.151 --> 00:57:35.710
They scuba dive for lobsters.

2024
00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:39.490
They go in the water and they've got their fucking goggles on and shit.

2025
00:57:39.491 --> 00:57:40.600
And they're looking for lobsters.

2026
00:57:40.840 --> 00:57:42.190
But there's a different lobster.

2027
00:57:42.220 --> 00:57:43.660
So lobster with no clause.

2028
00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:45.940
Some bitch ass pacifists lobster,

2029
00:57:46.150 --> 00:57:47.110
they don't taste as good.

2030
00:57:47.140 --> 00:57:50.350
You want the violent lobsters of Maine cold water,

2031
00:57:50.351 --> 00:57:50.921
angry,

2032
00:57:50.921 --> 00:57:52.150
beating the shit out of each other,

2033
00:57:52.510 --> 00:57:54.340
cotton off each other's fucking tentacles.

2034
00:57:54.630 --> 00:57:57.010
Those are the ones you capture it and there is so delicious.

2035
00:57:57.011 --> 00:57:58.000
They're like a sweet.

2036
00:57:58.240 --> 00:57:58.931
Those cold,

2037
00:57:58.931 --> 00:58:03.640
cold water lobster is Atlantic lobsters are his suite with butter.

2038
00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:06.760
The butter does help so much for the Diet.

2039
00:58:07.030 --> 00:58:07.361
It's butter.

2040
00:58:07.361 --> 00:58:07.660
Okay.

2041
00:58:07.660 --> 00:58:08.620
What about grass fed butter?

2042
00:58:08.780 --> 00:58:09.020
Yeah,

2043
00:58:09.020 --> 00:58:09.820
butter's great.

2044
00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:10.330
Has a great,

2045
00:58:10.330 --> 00:58:10.810
yeah,

2046
00:58:10.810 --> 00:58:11.440
it's fat.

2047
00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:12.970
We don't get enough fat in our diets.

2048
00:58:13.530 --> 00:58:14.290
That's really true.

2049
00:58:14.290 --> 00:58:14.890
Yeah,

2050
00:58:14.890 --> 00:58:15.723
I believe so.

2051
00:58:15.940 --> 00:58:17.020
What boat were fat,

2052
00:58:17.410 --> 00:58:18.243
so how does that work?

2053
00:58:18.910 --> 00:58:19.660
Well,

2054
00:58:19.660 --> 00:58:21.730
I know you're playing dead devil's advocate probably,

2055
00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:23.560
but you know you're so clever.

2056
00:58:23.980 --> 00:58:25.210
God Damn Canadians,

2057
00:58:25.211 --> 00:58:26.044
she wants to have a head.

2058
00:58:27.310 --> 00:58:27.821
It's a,

2059
00:58:27.821 --> 00:58:28.654
it's the sugar.

2060
00:58:28.810 --> 00:58:29.643
It's the sugar.

2061
00:58:29.890 --> 00:58:31.090
The sugar is this fast,

2062
00:58:31.150 --> 00:58:32.500
but we need fat in our diet.

2063
00:58:32.530 --> 00:58:33.430
Not to be fat.

2064
00:58:33.460 --> 00:58:34.450
We don't need to be fat,

2065
00:58:34.451 --> 00:58:35.620
but we need to eat fats.

2066
00:58:35.830 --> 00:58:36.041
Yeah.

2067
00:58:36.041 --> 00:58:37.210
For our cell membranes,

2068
00:58:37.211 --> 00:58:38.050
for our hormones.

2069
00:58:38.051 --> 00:58:39.100
Everything's made out of fat.

2070
00:58:39.130 --> 00:58:41.050
Everything good in her body's made out of fat.

2071
00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:41.771
Yeah,

2072
00:58:41.771 --> 00:58:42.730
like Avocados.

2073
00:58:42.731 --> 00:58:44.260
Even not even just animal fats.

2074
00:58:45.020 --> 00:58:47.140
There's a lot of good healthy coconut oil.

2075
00:58:47.141 --> 00:58:50.140
There's a lot of good healthy fats that we could use on a regular basis.

2076
00:58:50.710 --> 00:58:53.230
My wife talked me if an avocado in my backpack,

2077
00:58:53.290 --> 00:58:54.700
just freak out.

2078
00:58:54.780 --> 00:58:56.020
Some wife was never packed me up.

2079
00:58:56.021 --> 00:58:58.550
Fucking avocado on her life kind of.

2080
00:58:58.590 --> 00:58:59.920
I don't talk to her about that shit.

2081
00:59:02.350 --> 00:59:03.220
Do you eat game?

2082
00:59:03.250 --> 00:59:04.130
Do He game me?

2083
00:59:04.630 --> 00:59:05.590
There's so many guys.

2084
00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:06.670
I'm the only guy in my,

2085
00:59:06.671 --> 00:59:07.030
uh,

2086
00:59:07.030 --> 00:59:11.140
I play beer league hockey and I think I'm the only guy on our hockey team that

2087
00:59:11.141 --> 00:59:12.100
doesn't hunt.

2088
00:59:12.550 --> 00:59:13.900
So I got to get into this.

2089
00:59:14.140 --> 00:59:15.130
Would you get into hunting?

2090
00:59:15.190 --> 00:59:15.850
I'd love to.

2091
00:59:15.850 --> 00:59:16.331
I'm telling you,

2092
00:59:16.331 --> 00:59:16.541
man,

2093
00:59:16.541 --> 00:59:19.150
me and Steve Rinella been talking about doing a television show where we take

2094
00:59:19.151 --> 00:59:21.040
people out hunting that I've ever been hunting before.

2095
00:59:21.530 --> 00:59:22.130
The only problem

2096
00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:22.980
<v 2>with that idea,</v>

2097
00:59:23.300 --> 00:59:24.470
I don't have that much time.

2098
00:59:24.860 --> 00:59:25.910
And when I go out hunting,

2099
00:59:25.940 --> 00:59:27.380
I don't want to be go on hold in your hand,

2100
00:59:27.410 --> 00:59:28.190
Keith Webber.

2101
00:59:28.190 --> 00:59:29.570
I want to go out to shoot an animal,

2102
00:59:29.571 --> 00:59:30.404
but I can eat.

2103
00:59:30.640 --> 00:59:33.440
I'm going to have time to like show you how to shoot an animal.

2104
00:59:33.770 --> 00:59:34.400
So you're gonna have,

2105
00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:34.970
you're on your own.

2106
00:59:34.970 --> 00:59:35.560
That's what I'm saying.

2107
00:59:35.560 --> 00:59:36.010
Right.

2108
00:59:36.010 --> 00:59:40.370
Well and I think it seems like it is a weekly week long ordeal.

2109
00:59:40.550 --> 00:59:41.383
Oh yeah.

2110
00:59:41.510 --> 00:59:41.751
Well,

2111
00:59:41.751 --> 00:59:43.910
we just went for a week in Alaska and we struck out,

2112
00:59:44.090 --> 00:59:45.050
we didn't get anything,

2113
00:59:45.110 --> 00:59:46.670
so it's not always guaranteed.

2114
00:59:46.671 --> 00:59:48.140
This is my first strike out trip.

2115
00:59:48.680 --> 00:59:48.981
But,

2116
00:59:48.981 --> 00:59:49.460
uh,

2117
00:59:49.460 --> 00:59:49.850
I've,

2118
00:59:49.850 --> 00:59:51.470
every hunting trip I've been on,

2119
00:59:51.500 --> 00:59:54.500
it's been about a week and all of them up until this one had been successful.

2120
00:59:54.501 --> 00:59:55.161
But it's work,

2121
00:59:55.161 --> 00:59:55.520
man.

2122
00:59:55.520 --> 00:59:56.120
It's work.

2123
00:59:56.120 --> 00:59:57.680
Unless you want to go to a place where,

2124
00:59:57.681 --> 00:59:58.514
you know,

2125
00:59:58.580 --> 01:00:01.580
like you could go to a place that they have these ranches,

2126
01:00:01.581 --> 01:00:04.520
especially in Texas that are called high high fence ranches.

2127
01:00:04.790 --> 01:00:05.410
So the old,

2128
01:00:05.410 --> 01:00:06.980
it'd be x amount of acres.

2129
01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:08.240
A lot of them are huge,

2130
01:00:08.241 --> 01:00:09.630
like 10,000 plus acres,

2131
01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:12.500
but they're fenced in and there's animals in there for sure.

2132
01:00:12.710 --> 01:00:14.000
But it's all private property,

2133
01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:15.890
but it's kind of like a park,

2134
01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:16.850
you know?

2135
01:00:16.850 --> 01:00:17.360
I mean,

2136
01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:18.170
you know what I mean?

2137
01:00:18.170 --> 01:00:20.000
It's like once there's a fence,

2138
01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:23.990
I mean is it better than going to the grocery store and buying a steak from an

2139
01:00:23.991 --> 01:00:25.070
animal that lived in a pen?

2140
01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:25.521
Yes,

2141
01:00:25.521 --> 01:00:26.060
it is.

2142
01:00:26.060 --> 01:00:29.360
Most certainly because they are living in a very wild way there.

2143
01:00:29.670 --> 01:00:32.060
It's essentially what you would call fair chase.

2144
01:00:32.090 --> 01:00:35.600
There's 10,000 acres and these animals are living in this environment that is

2145
01:00:35.630 --> 01:00:37.010
absolutely natural.

2146
01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:38.480
They're not being fed.

2147
01:00:38.690 --> 01:00:39.523
There's not like,

2148
01:00:39.590 --> 01:00:40.190
you know,

2149
01:00:40.190 --> 01:00:44.840
the bell goes off at nine in the morning and the fucking the food pours out in

2150
01:00:44.841 --> 01:00:45.201
front of them.

2151
01:00:45.201 --> 01:00:48.710
It's not that they're just eating natural grasses and wanting to go wrong in

2152
01:00:48.711 --> 01:00:49.760
these natural environments,

2153
01:00:49.761 --> 01:00:51.770
but they're there for sure.

2154
01:00:52.250 --> 01:00:54.920
So it's Kinda like a stocked lake and some,

2155
01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:57.280
some ways that sounds pretty good,

2156
01:00:57.360 --> 01:00:59.060
but people don't have a problem with the stock lake,

2157
01:00:59.061 --> 01:01:01.010
but they do have a problem with a high fence hunting.

2158
01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:02.090
Hmm.

2159
01:01:02.090 --> 01:01:07.090
I think we feel like we have such an advantage already over animals that like to

2160
01:01:07.611 --> 01:01:08.930
have more of an advantage,

2161
01:01:08.931 --> 01:01:12.740
like to have them blocked in by an actual fence is kind of a pussy way of doing

2162
01:01:12.741 --> 01:01:13.460
it.

2163
01:01:13.460 --> 01:01:14.240
Does that make sense?

2164
01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:14.560
Yeah,

2165
01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:14.870
yeah.

2166
01:01:14.870 --> 01:01:15.051
No,

2167
01:01:15.051 --> 01:01:15.930
I could see that thought.

2168
01:01:15.990 --> 01:01:16.823
Hey,

2169
01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:18.500
I have friends that bow hunt,

2170
01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:19.520
uh,

2171
01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:22.160
which I find that's pretty respectable.

2172
01:01:22.310 --> 01:01:23.143
And uh,

2173
01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:24.620
that's actually how I hurt my shoulder.

2174
01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:27.090
I'm talking to you about getting Regena keen,

2175
01:01:27.140 --> 01:01:27.740
my shoulder,

2176
01:01:27.740 --> 01:01:28.200
right?

2177
01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:28.530
Yeah.

2178
01:01:28.530 --> 01:01:31.240
It's from pulling a boat too many times I could,

2179
01:01:31.250 --> 01:01:31.431
yeah,

2180
01:01:31.431 --> 01:01:32.750
that's good exercise isn't it?

2181
01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:33.350
It's,

2182
01:01:33.350 --> 01:01:33.561
it's,

2183
01:01:33.561 --> 01:01:33.741
well,

2184
01:01:33.741 --> 01:01:35.000
it's decent exercise,

2185
01:01:35.270 --> 01:01:36.770
but it's just repetitive stress.

2186
01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:37.460
I just,

2187
01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:38.210
I'm an idiot.

2188
01:01:38.210 --> 01:01:39.650
So I was doing it 150,

2189
01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:44.090
a hundred 150 times a day and you pull in between 80 and 90 pounds.

2190
01:01:44.450 --> 01:01:46.220
So I'm pulling 80 and 90 lbs.

2191
01:01:46.221 --> 01:01:49.040
I have two different bows and I'm doing it a hundred times a day plus.

2192
01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:51.260
So after awhile my shoulder was like,

2193
01:01:51.261 --> 01:01:52.094
fuck you stupid.

2194
01:01:52.370 --> 01:01:55.070
Like keep it getting us to do this when we're sore.

2195
01:01:55.071 --> 01:01:55.904
Stop.

2196
01:01:56.150 --> 01:01:58.190
Is that the shoulder that usually bugs you?

2197
01:01:58.490 --> 01:01:59.600
What doesn't usually bug me.

2198
01:01:59.601 --> 01:02:01.580
It's just started to bug me because of all the bow,

2199
01:02:01.940 --> 01:02:02.780
all the archery.

2200
01:02:03.740 --> 01:02:04.730
So I have a lighter bow.

2201
01:02:04.790 --> 01:02:05.780
Did I shoot with now too?

2202
01:02:06.050 --> 01:02:07.040
But archery is fun.

2203
01:02:07.041 --> 01:02:08.990
Just as far as like an exercise,

2204
01:02:08.991 --> 01:02:09.830
like for your mind,

2205
01:02:09.950 --> 01:02:13.970
like just to a zen sort of a thing to tune into that one spot you're trying to

2206
01:02:13.971 --> 01:02:14.420
hit.

2207
01:02:14.420 --> 01:02:15.680
Keep everything calm,

2208
01:02:15.710 --> 01:02:16.550
everything's together.

2209
01:02:16.551 --> 01:02:19.040
Tuned in like his shoe and let the Arrow,

2210
01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:22.800
everything's absolutely still just perfectly lined up.

2211
01:02:25.590 --> 01:02:26.423
Did she go,

2212
01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:29.070
I even inspired me at forget the guns.

2213
01:02:29.220 --> 01:02:29.560
Yeah.

2214
01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:30.121
Bow Hunting.

2215
01:02:30.121 --> 01:02:31.170
Bow Hunting for Moose.

2216
01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:33.990
How to make sure you shoot behind a tree though.

2217
01:02:33.991 --> 01:02:36.580
So the most charges while we circle the tree.

2218
01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:37.531
Yeah.

2219
01:02:37.531 --> 01:02:38.760
He just killed an elk.

2220
01:02:38.780 --> 01:02:39.111
He was,

2221
01:02:39.111 --> 01:02:39.390
yeah,

2222
01:02:39.390 --> 01:02:40.223
I couldn't believe it.

2223
01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:42.840
He borrowed a one of my mountain bikes to ride up there.

2224
01:02:42.841 --> 01:02:43.060
Hey,

2225
01:02:43.060 --> 01:02:43.893
slow pay.

2226
01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:44.760
He said,

2227
01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:46.500
why walk when I can borrow one of your bikes?

2228
01:02:46.530 --> 01:02:47.520
That's a smart dude.

2229
01:02:47.610 --> 01:02:48.443
Yeah.

2230
01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:50.490
But I think elk probably hear that bike.

2231
01:02:50.491 --> 01:02:51.180
Common core.

2232
01:02:51.180 --> 01:02:52.770
Like what the fuck is this guy doing?

2233
01:02:55.420 --> 01:02:55.680
Well,

2234
01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:59.580
he said what they do is they'll have the guy that's going to kill the thing in

2235
01:02:59.810 --> 01:03:03.750
sort of the danger area and then they'll have the guy calling it behind them.

2236
01:03:03.930 --> 01:03:04.441
Ah,

2237
01:03:04.441 --> 01:03:04.831
I see.

2238
01:03:04.831 --> 01:03:07.710
So it's like this thing is totally unsuspecting.

2239
01:03:07.711 --> 01:03:08.470
He's like,

2240
01:03:08.470 --> 01:03:09.090
what does that,

2241
01:03:09.090 --> 01:03:10.320
cause he thinks it's another male,

2242
01:03:10.321 --> 01:03:10.530
right?

2243
01:03:10.530 --> 01:03:11.220
Right.

2244
01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:11.380
Well,

2245
01:03:11.380 --> 01:03:13.860
either thinks it's another male or thinks it's a cow.

2246
01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:14.581
They,

2247
01:03:14.581 --> 01:03:15.270
um,

2248
01:03:15.270 --> 01:03:16.920
they called during what's called the Rut,

2249
01:03:17.010 --> 01:03:19.800
which is when the animals are all trying to get their sexy time in.

2250
01:03:19.890 --> 01:03:20.220
Right.

2251
01:03:20.220 --> 01:03:22.530
And they have this crazy noise.

2252
01:03:22.531 --> 01:03:24.210
If you never heard an elk bugle,

2253
01:03:24.750 --> 01:03:25.380
it's,

2254
01:03:25.380 --> 01:03:27.180
I've never heard it in real life.

2255
01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:28.650
I've heard cows,

2256
01:03:28.710 --> 01:03:29.850
they make a weird whistle.

2257
01:03:29.851 --> 01:03:31.050
I've heard that in real life.

2258
01:03:31.410 --> 01:03:35.220
But unless you're there during the spring or during the fall,

2259
01:03:35.221 --> 01:03:37.080
rather like a right around,

2260
01:03:37.081 --> 01:03:38.520
I think it's October ish,

2261
01:03:38.521 --> 01:03:39.301
like right around now.

2262
01:03:39.301 --> 01:03:40.650
Really is when they're,

2263
01:03:40.651 --> 01:03:41.221
they're running.

2264
01:03:41.221 --> 01:03:41.610
Yeah.

2265
01:03:41.610 --> 01:03:42.540
And when they're writing their,

2266
01:03:42.541 --> 01:03:43.374
they have this,

2267
01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:45.553
<v 4>okay.</v>

2268
01:03:47.370 --> 01:03:49.950
<v 2>It's crazy noise that they make this bugle.</v>

2269
01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:53.640
And the way you call them in is either you,

2270
01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:56.153
wow.

2271
01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:56.993
Yeah.

2272
01:03:57.180 --> 01:03:57.990
That's the real news.

2273
01:03:57.990 --> 01:03:58.823
A whale.

2274
01:03:58.890 --> 01:03:59.311
It does.

2275
01:03:59.311 --> 01:04:00.240
It's so crazy.

2276
01:04:00.570 --> 01:04:01.950
They're a majestic animal.

2277
01:04:01.980 --> 01:04:03.390
They really aren't majestic.

2278
01:04:03.870 --> 01:04:05.460
They're so fucking big.

2279
01:04:06.210 --> 01:04:08.040
There's like 1200 pounds,

2280
01:04:08.070 --> 01:04:08.670
some of them,

2281
01:04:08.670 --> 01:04:09.300
you know,

2282
01:04:09.300 --> 01:04:10.290
and that's so much meat.

2283
01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:10.531
I mean,

2284
01:04:10.531 --> 01:04:14.100
you shoot one of them mean you've got like essentially you've got a year's worth

2285
01:04:14.101 --> 01:04:14.820
of food.

2286
01:04:14.820 --> 01:04:15.421
It's amazing.

2287
01:04:15.421 --> 01:04:16.254
Yeah.

2288
01:04:16.290 --> 01:04:17.610
Total renewable resource.

2289
01:04:17.900 --> 01:04:19.140
They're constantly having babies.

2290
01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:24.320
You know the huge herds of him all throughout Utah and Idaho and Colorado.

2291
01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:27.410
That's so cool.

2292
01:04:27.870 --> 01:04:29.570
What a fucking wild animal man.

2293
01:04:30.380 --> 01:04:30.661
And they,

2294
01:04:30.661 --> 01:04:32.570
they practice like the calls,

2295
01:04:32.571 --> 01:04:32.781
right?

2296
01:04:32.781 --> 01:04:33.321
They have like,

2297
01:04:33.321 --> 01:04:33.450
yeah.

2298
01:04:33.450 --> 01:04:33.800
Yeah.

2299
01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:34.350
Whistles.

2300
01:04:34.350 --> 01:04:34.941
All the hunters.

2301
01:04:34.941 --> 01:04:35.600
Yeah.

2302
01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:38.660
There's a bunch of different companies that make different whistles that,

2303
01:04:39.020 --> 01:04:42.860
but it's funny because hunters can actually tell the difference between someone

2304
01:04:42.861 --> 01:04:47.861
using a hunting call that sounds like an elk and an actual elks sound.

2305
01:04:49.010 --> 01:04:51.230
So a lot of hunters are convinced that elk,

2306
01:04:51.530 --> 01:04:54.110
like smart elk that had been around for many seasons,

2307
01:04:54.111 --> 01:04:54.351
they go,

2308
01:04:54.351 --> 01:04:55.130
you know what?

2309
01:04:55.130 --> 01:04:56.480
I'm not buying that one.

2310
01:04:56.481 --> 01:04:57.710
I fucking heard that before.

2311
01:04:58.250 --> 01:05:01.040
Last on Arrow went flying near my head the last time I came here.

2312
01:05:01.041 --> 01:05:01.910
That fucking sound,

2313
01:05:02.630 --> 01:05:03.090
you know,

2314
01:05:03.090 --> 01:05:03.923
some of them,

2315
01:05:04.340 --> 01:05:06.320
they sound pretty realistic.

2316
01:05:06.321 --> 01:05:06.801
And other ones,

2317
01:05:06.801 --> 01:05:07.910
they just sound like a call,

2318
01:05:08.570 --> 01:05:09.403
but it's enough.

2319
01:05:09.530 --> 01:05:10.770
All you have to do is just get them there.

2320
01:05:10.771 --> 01:05:13.010
So horny apparently when it's going on there,

2321
01:05:13.011 --> 01:05:16.130
they have hard ons and their dicks are like flopping against their stomach.

2322
01:05:16.130 --> 01:05:17.210
When they come out screaming,

2323
01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:18.790
bellowing and they just,

2324
01:05:18.820 --> 01:05:19.211
they're like,

2325
01:05:19.211 --> 01:05:19.991
fuck you bitch.

2326
01:05:19.991 --> 01:05:20.200
You know,

2327
01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:22.750
you better not be making that noise my neighborhood.

2328
01:05:22.930 --> 01:05:24.460
And they come running out and that's when he'd get them.

2329
01:05:25.710 --> 01:05:29.530
Cause otherwise like getting close enough to shoot him with an Arrow is really

2330
01:05:29.531 --> 01:05:30.870
difficult or sense of smells.

2331
01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:31.713
Insane.

2332
01:05:31.750 --> 01:05:33.160
They're hearing is insane.

2333
01:05:33.310 --> 01:05:35.920
They're always on the lookout and you got to get within,

2334
01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:36.491
you know,

2335
01:05:36.491 --> 01:05:38.380
less than 50 yards most of the time.

2336
01:05:38.410 --> 01:05:39.243
Yeah.

2337
01:05:39.340 --> 01:05:40.120
And they have,

2338
01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:43.220
don't they have smells that the hunter has a smell that he puts on them?

2339
01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:45.100
You can do that.

2340
01:05:45.101 --> 01:05:46.360
You can spray things on you.

2341
01:05:46.530 --> 01:05:47.351
They will help a little,

2342
01:05:47.351 --> 01:05:48.730
their sense of smells just so,

2343
01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:52.520
it's so powerful though that human beings can't even really conceptualize it.

2344
01:05:52.521 --> 01:05:53.354
I don't think.

2345
01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:58.750
Our idea of what a smell is like when they're getting like a fucking Internet

2346
01:05:58.780 --> 01:06:00.820
download pdf file of you,

2347
01:06:00.821 --> 01:06:01.720
when they smell you,

2348
01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:02.793
they're getting like,

2349
01:06:02.830 --> 01:06:04.960
oh this guy's eating hamburgers is drinking beer.

2350
01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:06.100
We gotta get the Fuck Outta here.

2351
01:06:06.490 --> 01:06:07.380
I smell gunpowder,

2352
01:06:07.381 --> 01:06:08.214
let's go.

2353
01:06:08.430 --> 01:06:08.650
You know,

2354
01:06:08.650 --> 01:06:12.010
they just bolt like they're getting like so much information from your smell.

2355
01:06:12.270 --> 01:06:12.400
Yeah.

2356
01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:13.270
We think of it as like,

2357
01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:13.601
oh,

2358
01:06:13.601 --> 01:06:14.770
he can smell me.

2359
01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:17.200
I think they're getting like a book on you.

2360
01:06:17.290 --> 01:06:17.561
You know?

2361
01:06:17.561 --> 01:06:19.180
I think they just fucking,

2362
01:06:19.181 --> 01:06:23.080
they get your whole life story and like go see a lot of people.

2363
01:06:23.081 --> 01:06:23.410
Um,

2364
01:06:23.410 --> 01:06:26.530
the also eat grass and um,

2365
01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:31.300
vegetables only like a few guys I've talked to like the week of the hunt,

2366
01:06:31.540 --> 01:06:36.540
so their breath is the breath of a vegetation eating animal instead of like

2367
01:06:37.270 --> 01:06:40.360
someone who eats like a lot of meat and you're making burps that they,

2368
01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:42.730
he smells like rotten meat coming out of your face.

2369
01:06:42.790 --> 01:06:43.420
Like,

2370
01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:43.661
oh,

2371
01:06:43.661 --> 01:06:45.010
I think I know what this guy's up to.

2372
01:06:46.210 --> 01:06:46.631
It's true,

2373
01:06:46.631 --> 01:06:47.260
isn't it though?

2374
01:06:47.260 --> 01:06:49.000
I don't think you're supposed to eat that much meat.

2375
01:06:49.630 --> 01:06:52.870
Well I think if you were going near them and it would totally make sense.

2376
01:06:52.900 --> 01:06:53.080
Yeah.

2377
01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:56.590
If you were trying to track an animal that's worried about you eating it,

2378
01:06:57.070 --> 01:06:58.270
I would think that you would try to,

2379
01:06:58.510 --> 01:06:58.931
if you,

2380
01:06:58.931 --> 01:07:00.400
if you eat a lot of vegetables,

2381
01:07:00.401 --> 01:07:03.160
your breath would be that of a something that eats vegetables.

2382
01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:05.460
So they say that that's like the big giveaways,

2383
01:07:05.510 --> 01:07:06.343
your breath.

2384
01:07:06.790 --> 01:07:08.590
Some people even eat like spruce needles,

2385
01:07:08.860 --> 01:07:12.370
they'll choose spruce needles while they're out in the field because a,

2386
01:07:12.371 --> 01:07:16.210
it'll sort of mask the natural smells inside their breath.

2387
01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:17.801
I never heard that.

2388
01:07:17.801 --> 01:07:19.110
That makes total sense though.

2389
01:07:19.330 --> 01:07:20.200
It does about me bro.

2390
01:07:20.260 --> 01:07:21.610
Making total sense all day.

2391
01:07:23.710 --> 01:07:25.900
So you're your buddies and your hockey league,

2392
01:07:25.930 --> 01:07:26.890
they all a hunt.

2393
01:07:27.190 --> 01:07:27.750
Yeah.

2394
01:07:27.750 --> 01:07:27.961
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

2395
01:07:27.961 --> 01:07:28.490
they have.

2396
01:07:28.490 --> 01:07:29.323
They offered to take you.

2397
01:07:29.790 --> 01:07:30.271
They have,

2398
01:07:30.271 --> 01:07:31.104
yeah,

2399
01:07:31.210 --> 01:07:32.100
I got to take them.

2400
01:07:32.130 --> 01:07:32.491
It's just,

2401
01:07:32.491 --> 01:07:35.100
it worries me because it sounds like a bit of an alcoholic,

2402
01:07:35.101 --> 01:07:37.680
a paradise made.

2403
01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:38.550
Does it?

2404
01:07:38.550 --> 01:07:38.851
Yeah.

2405
01:07:38.851 --> 01:07:40.050
Like it sounds like they,

2406
01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:40.680
it is.

2407
01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:42.360
They do usually kill animals.

2408
01:07:42.420 --> 01:07:43.171
They're pretty good.

2409
01:07:43.171 --> 01:07:45.210
Like I think they do this every year since they were kids,

2410
01:07:45.211 --> 01:07:46.710
so they do a drunk as fuck.

2411
01:07:47.070 --> 01:07:49.890
Well I think they drink at night and after it's over.

2412
01:07:49.980 --> 01:07:50.310
Yeah,

2413
01:07:50.310 --> 01:07:52.530
I think they hunt all day and then at night they just,

2414
01:07:52.860 --> 01:07:53.850
it sounds like the,

2415
01:07:53.851 --> 01:07:54.684
uh,

2416
01:07:54.990 --> 01:07:56.250
they drink more than,

2417
01:07:56.340 --> 01:07:57.180
but they're pretty hot.

2418
01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:00.211
Yeah.

2419
01:08:00.211 --> 01:08:00.780
They're uh,

2420
01:08:00.780 --> 01:08:01.440
they're good.

2421
01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:02.273
Good Group of guys.

2422
01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:02.870
They're the,

2423
01:08:02.870 --> 01:08:03.300
uh,

2424
01:08:03.300 --> 01:08:05.790
Elberton blue collar Albert

2425
01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:08.333
archetype.

2426
01:08:08.510 --> 01:08:08.631
<v 2>Well,</v>

2427
01:08:08.631 --> 01:08:10.130
there's so much game up there in Alberta.

2428
01:08:10.131 --> 01:08:13.820
You guys have some of the biggest bucks like as far as like deer in the world.

2429
01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:14.320
Yeah.

2430
01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:16.400
It'll giant hundred pound white tails.

2431
01:08:16.401 --> 01:08:17.570
You have these enormous meal,

2432
01:08:17.571 --> 01:08:18.404
deers,

2433
01:08:18.740 --> 01:08:20.130
huge Moose bear.

2434
01:08:20.131 --> 01:08:21.980
You have black bear all over the place up there.

2435
01:08:22.190 --> 01:08:23.570
It's like a paradise of game.

2436
01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:24.301
<v 1>Well,</v>

2437
01:08:24.301 --> 01:08:25.620
even the city we live in is,

2438
01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:26.473
uh,

2439
01:08:26.550 --> 01:08:28.650
I see deer every day in my backyard.

2440
01:08:28.770 --> 01:08:29.603
Like it's,

2441
01:08:29.610 --> 01:08:30.660
they're like rabbits.

2442
01:08:30.990 --> 01:08:31.410
Really?

2443
01:08:31.410 --> 01:08:31.770
Yeah.

2444
01:08:31.770 --> 01:08:33.120
Just like white tailed deer.

2445
01:08:34.170 --> 01:08:34.470
Yeah.

2446
01:08:34.470 --> 01:08:34.780
Shoot.

2447
01:08:34.780 --> 01:08:34.901
Well,

2448
01:08:34.901 --> 01:08:35.611
how's things Keith?

2449
01:08:35.611 --> 01:08:37.260
Whenever I thought about it,

2450
01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:39.150
but I don't think you're allowed to in city limits.

2451
01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:40.080
<v 2>No.</v>

2452
01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:40.681
Well how,

2453
01:08:40.681 --> 01:08:41.640
what is like,

2454
01:08:41.641 --> 01:08:42.510
when you say city limits?

2455
01:08:42.511 --> 01:08:43.344
What city?

2456
01:08:43.470 --> 01:08:44.130
Red here.

2457
01:08:44.130 --> 01:08:44.281
Yeah.

2458
01:08:44.281 --> 01:08:45.240
You could shoot him in red deer.

2459
01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:45.781
Okay.

2460
01:08:45.781 --> 01:08:48.300
Name Red deer to the name of the city.

2461
01:08:48.510 --> 01:08:49.343
You're allowed to.

2462
01:08:50.210 --> 01:08:51.043
I read that.

2463
01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:56.040
If your finger yards over a certain size and you have a bow and Arrow,

2464
01:08:56.070 --> 01:08:57.180
but you probably get away with it.

2465
01:08:57.850 --> 01:08:58.330
Yeah,

2466
01:08:58.330 --> 01:08:58.880
you could.

2467
01:08:58.880 --> 01:08:59.713
You could.

2468
01:09:00.030 --> 01:09:01.700
The problem is if the deer hops,

2469
01:09:01.701 --> 01:09:04.320
the fence goes your neighbor's yard and it's fucking tits up,

2470
01:09:04.710 --> 01:09:07.080
bleeding out on his lawn and he's like,

2471
01:09:07.081 --> 01:09:07.531
Hey Keith,

2472
01:09:07.531 --> 01:09:08.780
wherever you fucking Dick head,

2473
01:09:08.820 --> 01:09:09.030
I'm like,

2474
01:09:09.030 --> 01:09:12.840
you don't shoot a fucking animal in my neighborhood.

2475
01:09:12.870 --> 01:09:14.100
I got to clean this lawn.

2476
01:09:16.770 --> 01:09:17.410
Um,

2477
01:09:17.410 --> 01:09:18.180
if they have,

2478
01:09:18.180 --> 01:09:19.740
they've invited you to come along,

2479
01:09:19.741 --> 01:09:23.370
would you have to like take a firearm safety thing or anything up there?

2480
01:09:23.460 --> 01:09:24.031
You have to do that.

2481
01:09:24.031 --> 01:09:25.400
Like take a hunter's education.

2482
01:09:25.410 --> 01:09:25.510
Yeah,

2483
01:09:25.510 --> 01:09:25.960
<v 1>of course.</v>

2484
01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:26.290
Yeah.

2485
01:09:26.290 --> 01:09:27.670
And I don't think it's that big of a deal.

2486
01:09:27.930 --> 01:09:28.361
It sounds,

2487
01:09:28.361 --> 01:09:31.890
and my dad has a bunch of rifles and stuff that he doesn't use,

2488
01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:33.720
<v 2>so what the fuck Keith,</v>

2489
01:09:33.750 --> 01:09:34.120
get it,

2490
01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:36.390
get it crack and it's the healthiest meat as far as like,

2491
01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:38.590
it's also the most ethically you're,

2492
01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:40.770
you're so connected to whatever you're eating.

2493
01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:43.500
You shoot a deer and you cut the deer up and you eat it.

2494
01:09:43.530 --> 01:09:43.940
You,

2495
01:09:43.940 --> 01:09:48.480
you were 100% completely invested and connected with that animal as opposed to

2496
01:09:48.481 --> 01:09:49.830
that weird disconnect that you get,

2497
01:09:49.831 --> 01:09:52.230
especially when you eat like Baloney,

2498
01:09:52.610 --> 01:09:52.921
you know,

2499
01:09:52.921 --> 01:09:54.270
have I got Bologna Sandwich?

2500
01:09:54.271 --> 01:09:54.691
Like what?

2501
01:09:54.691 --> 01:09:54.930
Hey,

2502
01:09:54.930 --> 01:09:55.880
what even is that,

2503
01:09:55.881 --> 01:09:56.130
like,

2504
01:09:56.130 --> 01:10:00.960
what steps have been taken to turn this into this perfectly symmetrical round

2505
01:10:00.961 --> 01:10:04.620
slice of whatever the fuck it is that used to be alive thing.

2506
01:10:04.990 --> 01:10:06.580
<v 1>I remember the Bologna when I was a kid,</v>

2507
01:10:06.581 --> 01:10:10.270
they used to have like the little Alpha Getty's embedded into it.

2508
01:10:10.271 --> 01:10:10.880
I don't know if he ever,

2509
01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:11.830
what's an Alpha Getty?

2510
01:10:12.310 --> 01:10:13.143
You never had that.

2511
01:10:13.290 --> 01:10:13.510
It's like,

2512
01:10:13.510 --> 01:10:14.410
I don't know what that means.

2513
01:10:14.650 --> 01:10:15.251
Alpha Getty.

2514
01:10:15.251 --> 01:10:15.821
Oh my God.

2515
01:10:15.821 --> 01:10:16.001
Yeah.

2516
01:10:16.001 --> 01:10:17.470
It's a like a can of,

2517
01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:17.800
uh,

2518
01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:18.980
like pasta with,

2519
01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:19.833
uh,

2520
01:10:20.070 --> 01:10:20.341
you know,

2521
01:10:20.341 --> 01:10:23.580
the tomato sauce and the various letters of the alphabet and,

2522
01:10:23.581 --> 01:10:23.900
Yep.

2523
01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:25.900
<v 2>Oh good.</v>

2524
01:10:25.901 --> 01:10:26.630
He goes,

2525
01:10:26.630 --> 01:10:27.081
yeah,

2526
01:10:27.081 --> 01:10:28.250
like spaghettios with,

2527
01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:29.113
with letters.

2528
01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:29.940
Yeah.

2529
01:10:29.940 --> 01:10:30.800
Alpha Yeti.

2530
01:10:30.870 --> 01:10:35.810
Forgetting poor Canada for Canada makes me sad.

2531
01:10:37.430 --> 01:10:37.860
No,

2532
01:10:37.860 --> 01:10:38.570
doesn't,

2533
01:10:38.570 --> 01:10:39.111
I mean this,

2534
01:10:39.111 --> 01:10:40.400
we have something similar.

2535
01:10:40.700 --> 01:10:41.510
What is that called?

2536
01:10:41.510 --> 01:10:42.770
It's not spaghettios,

2537
01:10:43.030 --> 01:10:43.863
<v 1>what is it?</v>

2538
01:10:44.050 --> 01:10:44.883
Alphabet,

2539
01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:46.241
alphabet soup.

2540
01:10:46.241 --> 01:10:46.840
I don't know.

2541
01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:47.021
Yeah,

2542
01:10:47.021 --> 01:10:48.460
there's alphabet soup for sure.

2543
01:10:48.490 --> 01:10:49.323
That's like that.

2544
01:10:49.930 --> 01:10:50.470
But yeah,

2545
01:10:50.470 --> 01:10:51.200
I know what you're saying.

2546
01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:51.780
Yeah.

2547
01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:52.613
Yeah.

2548
01:10:53.270 --> 01:10:54.103
I think we're getting,

2549
01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:54.993
it always makes me,

2550
01:10:56.140 --> 01:10:57.280
it always makes I die,

2551
01:10:57.281 --> 01:10:58.120
but I still people,

2552
01:10:58.180 --> 01:10:59.650
I still see people eating Bologna.

2553
01:11:00.460 --> 01:11:01.293
Is it bad for you?

2554
01:11:01.450 --> 01:11:02.283
I don't think it's good.

2555
01:11:02.380 --> 01:11:03.400
It's definitely not good for you.

2556
01:11:03.850 --> 01:11:08.740
Now that's the one thing with the Paleo and that they're big on Bacon.

2557
01:11:09.310 --> 01:11:09.671
Right,

2558
01:11:09.671 --> 01:11:09.881
right,

2559
01:11:09.881 --> 01:11:10.151
right.

2560
01:11:10.151 --> 01:11:10.750
And I,

2561
01:11:10.750 --> 01:11:11.201
I love,

2562
01:11:11.201 --> 01:11:12.490
I'm sure we all love Bacon,

2563
01:11:12.491 --> 01:11:14.010
but I don't think should eat that much

2564
01:11:14.010 --> 01:11:14.843
<v 2>of it.</v>

2565
01:11:15.030 --> 01:11:16.810
Like I'm leery about that concept of,

2566
01:11:16.820 --> 01:11:17.653
uh,

2567
01:11:17.670 --> 01:11:19.380
that much sodium and nitrate.

2568
01:11:19.381 --> 01:11:21.260
But I guess it's depends on the type of bacon.

2569
01:11:21.300 --> 01:11:24.420
I guess there's probably Bacon out there that you can have natural beg and it

2570
01:11:24.421 --> 01:11:25.500
doesn't last as long.

2571
01:11:26.190 --> 01:11:27.190
But I,

2572
01:11:27.330 --> 01:11:28.200
from what I understand,

2573
01:11:28.201 --> 01:11:32.280
there's certain natural nitrates in like sea salt and celery.

2574
01:11:32.340 --> 01:11:36.270
Celery apparently is naturally high in nitrates and salary is not bad for you.

2575
01:11:36.570 --> 01:11:38.160
So I guess is it just,

2576
01:11:38.660 --> 01:11:39.420
Oh,

2577
01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:43.410
I have to fucking have Rhonda Patrick on soon have to ask her about nitrates.

2578
01:11:43.650 --> 01:11:44.520
I don't understand that.

2579
01:11:44.910 --> 01:11:45.743
Yeah.

2580
01:11:45.900 --> 01:11:48.270
It's supposed to produce carcinogens or something like that.

2581
01:11:48.450 --> 01:11:49.260
Allegedly.

2582
01:11:49.260 --> 01:11:50.080
Allegedly.

2583
01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:52.080
And that what the TSA always fines on people.

2584
01:11:52.110 --> 01:11:55.710
Nitrates give your high nitrates we to pull you over in this room.

2585
01:11:56.010 --> 01:11:56.401
Yeah.

2586
01:11:56.401 --> 01:11:57.001
Like if you,

2587
01:11:57.001 --> 01:11:57.390
uh,

2588
01:11:57.390 --> 01:11:58.590
have been on a farm,

2589
01:11:58.620 --> 01:11:59.880
that's one of the things they say.

2590
01:12:00.210 --> 01:12:00.891
Like if you,

2591
01:12:00.891 --> 01:12:01.300
uh,

2592
01:12:01.300 --> 01:12:02.490
well here's a funny story.

2593
01:12:02.790 --> 01:12:04.440
When Brian First started working for me,

2594
01:12:04.470 --> 01:12:06.840
actually I think before Brian was even working for me,

2595
01:12:07.020 --> 01:12:08.730
he was selling a laptop.

2596
01:12:08.731 --> 01:12:11.460
He had a laptop and he put it up for sale on the,

2597
01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:12.510
on the message board.

2598
01:12:12.690 --> 01:12:13.380
And I purse,

2599
01:12:13.380 --> 01:12:14.250
I private messaged them,

2600
01:12:14.251 --> 01:12:14.700
I said,

2601
01:12:14.700 --> 01:12:15.540
I need a laptop,

2602
01:12:15.541 --> 01:12:18.270
like a second laptop for work stuff.

2603
01:12:18.340 --> 01:12:19.410
It was a windows laptop.

2604
01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:20.251
And I said,

2605
01:12:20.251 --> 01:12:20.760
I'll buy it.

2606
01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:23.040
So he sold me the laptop,

2607
01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:24.113
sent it to me,

2608
01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:26.790
and then I took it like from the moment I got it from,

2609
01:12:26.820 --> 01:12:28.560
I took it on the road and uh,

2610
01:12:28.561 --> 01:12:32.010
I put it in my bag and I went through the airport and they immediately flagged

2611
01:12:32.011 --> 01:12:34.410
it and they pulled me aside and they said,

2612
01:12:34.411 --> 01:12:34.800
your,

2613
01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:37.710
your laptop is testing positive for explosives.

2614
01:12:38.310 --> 01:12:38.821
And I went,

2615
01:12:38.821 --> 01:12:39.510
what?

2616
01:12:39.510 --> 01:12:40.343
What do you mean?

2617
01:12:40.380 --> 01:12:40.921
And they were like,

2618
01:12:40.921 --> 01:12:41.191
well,

2619
01:12:41.191 --> 01:12:42.630
have you ever been to a farm recently?

2620
01:12:42.810 --> 01:12:45.660
And all I could think of is that motherfucker cranking me.

2621
01:12:45.930 --> 01:12:50.010
He puts a fucking gun powder all over the laptop and then sold it to me.

2622
01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:50.950
But it just,

2623
01:12:50.950 --> 01:12:51.783
it had,

2624
01:12:51.930 --> 01:12:52.770
for some reason,

2625
01:12:52.771 --> 01:12:57.771
it tested for trace amounts of nitrogen and traits or whatever the fuck it was.

2626
01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:00.840
And that's what they find on explosives.

2627
01:13:01.070 --> 01:13:01.250
Well,

2628
01:13:01.250 --> 01:13:01.451
they,

2629
01:13:01.451 --> 01:13:01.661
the,

2630
01:13:01.661 --> 01:13:01.981
you know,

2631
01:13:01.981 --> 01:13:06.270
you can have fertilizer bombs like what they used at Oklahoma City apparently

2632
01:13:06.271 --> 01:13:07.620
was a fertilizer bomb.

2633
01:13:08.220 --> 01:13:10.500
Remember that Timothy Mcveigh thing?

2634
01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:15.660
Supposedly there's a lot of controversy and conspiracy theories regarding that

2635
01:13:15.661 --> 01:13:16.171
incident.

2636
01:13:16.171 --> 01:13:19.250
They believe it wasn't just that it was other bombs plans in the bill,

2637
01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:19.861
whatever,

2638
01:13:19.861 --> 01:13:20.640
I don't know.

2639
01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:22.830
But you can make a fertilizer bomb.

2640
01:13:22.831 --> 01:13:23.700
It's pretty potent.

2641
01:13:24.060 --> 01:13:26.430
So that's what they're worried about when they test your laptop and they find

2642
01:13:26.431 --> 01:13:28.740
that shit fertilizers,

2643
01:13:30.330 --> 01:13:32.220
they're bombs now,

2644
01:13:32.221 --> 01:13:32.610
you know,

2645
01:13:32.610 --> 01:13:33.443
manure,

2646
01:13:33.690 --> 01:13:34.410
nitrates,

2647
01:13:34.410 --> 01:13:35.243
methane,

2648
01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:36.270
like that shit.

2649
01:13:36.270 --> 01:13:37.350
Like your farts on fire.

2650
01:13:37.470 --> 01:13:39.270
You could also blow up people's Shit

2651
01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:42.480
like in fight club where they,

2652
01:13:42.481 --> 01:13:43.050
uh,

2653
01:13:43.050 --> 01:13:47.010
took the soap or the human fat and meat soap and bombs out of that.

2654
01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:47.881
Oh yeah,

2655
01:13:47.881 --> 01:13:48.241
that's right.

2656
01:13:48.241 --> 01:13:48.810
Right.

2657
01:13:48.810 --> 01:13:49.643
Yeah,

2658
01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:50.513
that works.

2659
01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:55.290
Do you ever see that video where that whale is a beached whale and his body's

2660
01:13:55.291 --> 01:13:56.970
rotting and it explodes?

2661
01:13:57.070 --> 01:13:57.903
We will see that.

2662
01:13:58.750 --> 01:13:59.910
If you're sitting there like never see,

2663
01:13:59.911 --> 01:14:00.481
oh my God,

2664
01:14:00.481 --> 01:14:01.171
it's fucking crazy.

2665
01:14:01.171 --> 01:14:03.330
See if he can find a Jamie probe the videos.

2666
01:14:03.340 --> 01:14:04.141
See Keith could watch it.

2667
01:14:04.141 --> 01:14:04.710
Yeah.

2668
01:14:04.710 --> 01:14:05.560
You know your body's,

2669
01:14:05.561 --> 01:14:06.350
uh,

2670
01:14:06.350 --> 01:14:09.420
when this whales bodies rotting on the beach,

2671
01:14:09.450 --> 01:14:11.290
I guess it just comes to some boiling.

2672
01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:12.040
Were they moving

2673
01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:13.060
<v 3>it when it exploded?</v>

2674
01:14:13.570 --> 01:14:14.970
There are trying to and they couldn't.

2675
01:14:14.971 --> 01:14:17.380
It just took too long and it fucking exploded.

2676
01:14:18.190 --> 01:14:18.311
Oh,

2677
01:14:18.311 --> 01:14:20.590
there was one where they were taking it in a truck.

2678
01:14:20.830 --> 01:14:21.663
You remember that?

2679
01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:22.460
They were,

2680
01:14:22.460 --> 01:14:25.780
they had a beached whale and they'd pick the beach whale up and they were moving

2681
01:14:25.781 --> 01:14:30.270
it and as they were moving and it exploded literally like a bomb.

2682
01:14:30.790 --> 01:14:33.370
But there's one that blew up on purpose too,

2683
01:14:33.371 --> 01:14:35.190
I think because it had to get rid of the body and then,

2684
01:14:35.230 --> 01:14:35.471
yeah,

2685
01:14:35.471 --> 01:14:36.400
I don't want to see that one.

2686
01:14:36.670 --> 01:14:38.230
I want to see natural zone bomb.

2687
01:14:38.620 --> 01:14:40.000
That'll happen with wildlife too.

2688
01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:41.200
I remember when I was a kid,

2689
01:14:41.201 --> 01:14:43.060
we lived out in the middle of nowhere and uh,

2690
01:14:43.990 --> 01:14:44.823
uh,

2691
01:14:45.220 --> 01:14:49.720
there people would leave the animals in the ditch and after a couple of weeks

2692
01:14:49.721 --> 01:14:51.740
the stomach would just expand like a,

2693
01:14:51.990 --> 01:14:54.250
like almost like you're blowing a bubble from bubblegum.

2694
01:14:55.180 --> 01:14:56.620
So I remember being a kid,

2695
01:14:56.621 --> 01:14:59.710
I could never chew bubblegum cause my mom would be so disgusted because it would

2696
01:14:59.711 --> 01:15:03.400
remind her of this big sack of a stomach ripping out of this animal's body.

2697
01:15:03.401 --> 01:15:06.970
Hey cause all the little lab bacteria and everything go to work once the animal

2698
01:15:06.971 --> 01:15:09.250
dies and it just like swells up into this big.

2699
01:15:09.610 --> 01:15:14.610
And I vaguely remember seeing an animal with like a big pink bubble sticking out

2700
01:15:14.741 --> 01:15:15.574
of its gut.

2701
01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:16.910
Why?

2702
01:15:16.910 --> 01:15:18.640
Cause if you don't get an animal right away,

2703
01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:20.380
like a deer and elk or something,

2704
01:15:20.410 --> 01:15:24.670
it'll starts rotting little rotten and like the stomach is fairly thin,

2705
01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:25.481
their skin.

2706
01:15:25.481 --> 01:15:27.370
So it'll actually start to expand.

2707
01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:31.120
That makes me sad that some people don't eat the organs of the animals.

2708
01:15:31.180 --> 01:15:31.821
They kill it.

2709
01:15:31.821 --> 01:15:32.890
So it's so wasted.

2710
01:15:32.891 --> 01:15:33.340
I mean,

2711
01:15:33.340 --> 01:15:36.790
ultimately it's all going to get eaten by bacteria and other life forms anyway,

2712
01:15:36.791 --> 01:15:37.331
and you know,

2713
01:15:37.331 --> 01:15:39.430
scavengers it will all go to use.

2714
01:15:39.430 --> 01:15:40.480
If you just leave it there,

2715
01:15:40.481 --> 01:15:41.320
it'll go to use.

2716
01:15:41.321 --> 01:15:41.830
Yeah.

2717
01:15:41.830 --> 01:15:44.740
But the Oregons or some of the best parts of the body,

2718
01:15:44.741 --> 01:15:46.120
like as far as like eating,

2719
01:15:46.121 --> 01:15:50.140
like eating the liver and eating the heart is fantastic and very nutritious.

2720
01:15:50.141 --> 01:15:50.841
Really good for you.

2721
01:15:50.841 --> 01:15:51.850
Do you live eat liver?

2722
01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:52.271
Yeah.

2723
01:15:52.271 --> 01:15:53.710
I love liver livers.

2724
01:15:53.711 --> 01:15:58.711
Delicious and liver off a deer like a fresh deer liver that you just shot is so

2725
01:15:58.930 --> 01:15:59.560
good.

2726
01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:01.060
It's incredible how good it is.

2727
01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:02.800
When we were in Montana,

2728
01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:03.401
we,

2729
01:16:03.401 --> 01:16:03.611
uh,

2730
01:16:03.611 --> 01:16:08.611
we shot these deer and I shot a deer and within two hours we were cooking the

2731
01:16:09.131 --> 01:16:12.700
liver over a campfire and it was just unbelievable.

2732
01:16:12.701 --> 01:16:14.740
We were just eating and called all my God,

2733
01:16:14.741 --> 01:16:15.700
this is incredible.

2734
01:16:15.940 --> 01:16:18.400
And then we fry it up the heart and we ate the heart the same way,

2735
01:16:18.730 --> 01:16:19.870
like right over the campfire.

2736
01:16:19.900 --> 01:16:20.733
It's incredible.

2737
01:16:20.930 --> 01:16:21.763
If you find anything,

2738
01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:23.291
caution,

2739
01:16:23.291 --> 01:16:23.740
warning,

2740
01:16:23.740 --> 01:16:24.161
caution,

2741
01:16:24.161 --> 01:16:24.880
warning.

2742
01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:26.740
Some viewers may find a sister of man's man.

2743
01:16:26.741 --> 01:16:27.010
Those,

2744
01:16:27.010 --> 01:16:28.360
those viewers are pussies.

2745
01:16:28.390 --> 01:16:29.223
Here we go.

2746
01:16:29.950 --> 01:16:30.581
Let's pitch.

2747
01:16:30.581 --> 01:16:31.990
Go see what the fuck this is.

2748
01:16:32.110 --> 01:16:33.900
Are we going to get flagged on Youtube for this?

2749
01:16:34.750 --> 01:16:35.141
Okay,

2750
01:16:35.141 --> 01:16:35.974
here we go.

2751
01:16:36.580 --> 01:16:37.180
Look at this.

2752
01:16:37.180 --> 01:16:40.450
They're carving into this whale and as they're carving into it,

2753
01:16:40.451 --> 01:16:42.070
it's Oh God,

2754
01:16:42.370 --> 01:16:43.090
look at that.

2755
01:16:43.090 --> 01:16:44.380
Oh my God.

2756
01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:46.330
That's insane.

2757
01:16:46.690 --> 01:16:47.980
The guy runs like a bitch.

2758
01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:49.553
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

2759
01:16:49.990 --> 01:16:50.381
<v 3>What'd you think?</v>

2760
01:16:50.381 --> 01:16:51.400
It's going to blow up again,

2761
01:16:51.401 --> 01:16:51.730
sir.

2762
01:16:51.730 --> 01:16:53.260
Look how far it's shot.

2763
01:16:53.770 --> 01:16:55.270
Splattered all over the wall.

2764
01:16:55.290 --> 01:16:55.920
It's Charlotte again,

2765
01:16:55.920 --> 01:16:56.753
Jamie.

2766
01:16:57.290 --> 01:16:58.123
<v 6>Okay,</v>

2767
01:16:59.310 --> 01:17:00.143
<v 3>that's crazy.</v>

2768
01:17:01.800 --> 01:17:04.170
So he is digging into it

2769
01:17:06.010 --> 01:17:07.240
to relieve pressure,

2770
01:17:07.241 --> 01:17:08.074
I guess.

2771
01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:11.673
<v 2>Oh,</v>

2772
01:17:13.250 --> 01:17:14.960
what a weird fucking job.

2773
01:17:15.140 --> 01:17:15.973
What do you do?

2774
01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:17.060
Well,

2775
01:17:17.060 --> 01:17:18.320
you know when whales die,

2776
01:17:19.310 --> 01:17:23.870
I go and I cut in that looked like it would fuck you up.

2777
01:17:24.570 --> 01:17:26.330
That's not just a little explosion.

2778
01:17:26.331 --> 01:17:28.970
That's like a serious ferocious explosion.

2779
01:17:31.100 --> 01:17:31.700
Boom.

2780
01:17:31.700 --> 01:17:33.050
Like if you were standing right in front of that,

2781
01:17:33.260 --> 01:17:33.891
you're going down,

2782
01:17:33.891 --> 01:17:34.724
bitch,

2783
01:17:35.050 --> 01:17:35.900
you going to get hurt.

2784
01:17:36.020 --> 01:17:37.010
Imagine if that's how he died.

2785
01:17:37.910 --> 01:17:38.450
How'd you die?

2786
01:17:38.450 --> 01:17:39.070
Well,

2787
01:17:39.070 --> 01:17:43.370
when I was beached whale can and cut into it and it fucking blew up in my face.

2788
01:17:43.910 --> 01:17:44.743
Took my hat off.

2789
01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:46.273
Here I am.

2790
01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:47.233
And having

2791
01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:49.273
feeling bad

2792
01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:51.530
when your friends go hunting,

2793
01:17:51.531 --> 01:17:52.364
they give you me.

2794
01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:53.713
<v 1>Um,</v>

2795
01:17:54.410 --> 01:17:55.243
no,

2796
01:17:55.310 --> 01:17:55.761
actually you don't,

2797
01:17:55.761 --> 01:17:56.594
I shouldn't say that.

2798
01:17:57.110 --> 01:17:57.943
Uh,

2799
01:17:58.050 --> 01:18:03.050
cause it's customary after a beer league hockey game to indulge in meat type

2800
01:18:03.651 --> 01:18:04.310
snacks,

2801
01:18:04.310 --> 01:18:05.143
cheese,

2802
01:18:05.570 --> 01:18:06.480
a pref,

2803
01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:09.410
preferably going out to a local pub to have chicken wings,

2804
01:18:09.710 --> 01:18:10.543
beer,

2805
01:18:10.580 --> 01:18:11.301
rum and cokes,

2806
01:18:11.301 --> 01:18:12.134
things like that.

2807
01:18:12.710 --> 01:18:13.400
Um,

2808
01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:17.690
but there are times when we're in a place where they don't have a good pub and

2809
01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:20.180
outcomes the beef jerky and everyone's really,

2810
01:18:20.210 --> 01:18:20.821
cause I think they,

2811
01:18:20.821 --> 01:18:21.920
they use a lot of them,

2812
01:18:22.010 --> 01:18:22.843
the animal,

2813
01:18:23.140 --> 01:18:23.540
uh,

2814
01:18:23.540 --> 01:18:24.710
to make beef jerky out of.

2815
01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:25.630
So,

2816
01:18:25.630 --> 01:18:27.810
and everyone's very proud of their secret recipe,

2817
01:18:27.811 --> 01:18:28.290
so.

2818
01:18:28.290 --> 01:18:28.741
<v 2>Right,</v>

2819
01:18:28.741 --> 01:18:29.011
right,

2820
01:18:29.011 --> 01:18:29.340
right.

2821
01:18:29.340 --> 01:18:30.010
Yeah.

2822
01:18:30.010 --> 01:18:30.750
Amazing.

2823
01:18:30.750 --> 01:18:31.860
That is a cool thing about,

2824
01:18:31.861 --> 01:18:32.220
um,

2825
01:18:32.220 --> 01:18:34.990
a lot of hunters that they get really into cooking because they're,

2826
01:18:34.991 --> 01:18:37.230
they're so connected with the meat that they get themselves,

2827
01:18:37.231 --> 01:18:40.650
they start getting into like being a chef and like Steve [inaudible],

2828
01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:41.880
he's a big time chef.

2829
01:18:41.881 --> 01:18:43.200
He loves cooking food.

2830
01:18:43.201 --> 01:18:44.034
The new Max.

2831
01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:46.260
Do you cook your own meals?

2832
01:18:46.261 --> 01:18:46.981
Do you have like,

2833
01:18:46.981 --> 01:18:47.460
um,

2834
01:18:47.460 --> 01:18:52.330
like very specific recipes that you follow as far as like healthy eating and we

2835
01:18:52.340 --> 01:18:53.520
don't ring from exercise.

2836
01:18:54.140 --> 01:18:54.381
<v 1>We,</v>

2837
01:18:54.381 --> 01:18:54.890
uh,

2838
01:18:54.890 --> 01:18:56.030
we eat a lot of soup.

2839
01:18:56.360 --> 01:18:56.810
Soup.

2840
01:18:56.810 --> 01:18:57.230
Yeah.

2841
01:18:57.230 --> 01:18:58.940
Even for breakfast wheeler.

2842
01:18:59.000 --> 01:18:59.390
Yeah.

2843
01:18:59.390 --> 01:19:00.223
Why Soup?

2844
01:19:00.230 --> 01:19:00.860
Uh,

2845
01:19:00.860 --> 01:19:05.860
it's a really easy way to get a lot of vegetables into your diet.

2846
01:19:06.770 --> 01:19:07.310
Um,

2847
01:19:07.310 --> 01:19:08.660
and we use these animal bro.

2848
01:19:08.690 --> 01:19:08.961
Like we,

2849
01:19:08.961 --> 01:19:13.640
we've got a few local sort of grass fed places that you can get the soup bones

2850
01:19:13.641 --> 01:19:14.474
from.

2851
01:19:14.570 --> 01:19:15.050
Uh,

2852
01:19:15.050 --> 01:19:17.450
so we'll boil these bones for a day or two,

2853
01:19:17.451 --> 01:19:19.310
just get all that Gel and everything off him.

2854
01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:20.390
Throw that in the,

2855
01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:23.000
the concoction of boiled vegetables.

2856
01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:24.110
And,

2857
01:19:24.110 --> 01:19:24.943
uh,

2858
01:19:25.010 --> 01:19:26.360
and according to my wife,

2859
01:19:26.390 --> 01:19:29.780
this is good to have something warm in the stomach in the morning cause our

2860
01:19:29.781 --> 01:19:30.620
stomach fire,

2861
01:19:31.190 --> 01:19:32.023
again,

2862
01:19:32.210 --> 01:19:33.650
this is all terminology,

2863
01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:34.531
uh,

2864
01:19:34.531 --> 01:19:35.900
is it's our stomachs.

2865
01:19:36.230 --> 01:19:38.540
Our digestive enzymes aren't as active in the morning.

2866
01:19:38.541 --> 01:19:39.590
So if you eat this soup,

2867
01:19:39.591 --> 01:19:42.170
it sort of gets things going in the right direction.

2868
01:19:42.171 --> 01:19:42.710
So,

2869
01:19:42.710 --> 01:19:43.880
and then with my job,

2870
01:19:43.881 --> 01:19:45.050
I don't like to take a lunch break.

2871
01:19:45.051 --> 01:19:47.180
I like to just blast straight on through for eight hours.

2872
01:19:47.181 --> 01:19:47.930
So,

2873
01:19:47.930 --> 01:19:48.190
uh,

2874
01:19:48.190 --> 01:19:50.540
I just throw it in a Vitamix or what's your job?

2875
01:19:50.541 --> 01:19:51.410
What's your regular job?

2876
01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:52.580
A physiotherapist.

2877
01:19:52.940 --> 01:19:55.400
So you work with are people that are injured and things along those lines?

2878
01:19:55.401 --> 01:19:56.030
Yeah.

2879
01:19:56.030 --> 01:20:01.030
So I go from person to person and I don't have a ton of time in between to have

2880
01:20:01.161 --> 01:20:03.860
a big meal and I find that makes me tired anyway.

2881
01:20:03.890 --> 01:20:05.720
So tear fall the warrior diet?

2882
01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:06.401
Uh,

2883
01:20:06.401 --> 01:20:06.610
yeah.

2884
01:20:06.610 --> 01:20:07.443
You know,

2885
01:20:07.560 --> 01:20:08.100
I did that

2886
01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:12.060
<v 3>for a while just because it was convenient because I didn't have to eat all day</v>

2887
01:20:12.061 --> 01:20:12.810
and then,

2888
01:20:12.810 --> 01:20:14.920
but I found I pigged out a little bit too much at night,

2889
01:20:14.921 --> 01:20:15.754
so yeah.

2890
01:20:16.380 --> 01:20:17.850
But I think there's something to that,

2891
01:20:18.180 --> 01:20:19.110
especially after reading,

2892
01:20:19.111 --> 01:20:19.261
eat,

2893
01:20:19.261 --> 01:20:19.561
stop,

2894
01:20:19.561 --> 01:20:19.771
eat.

2895
01:20:19.771 --> 01:20:21.880
I think it was Rhonda Rousey was fallen off for awhile.

2896
01:20:22.100 --> 01:20:23.480
I know she's found anymore,

2897
01:20:23.490 --> 01:20:24.301
but she was essentially,

2898
01:20:24.301 --> 01:20:26.850
she would eat like berries and some fruits during the day.

2899
01:20:26.851 --> 01:20:29.670
But from primarily her main meal was one meal at night.

2900
01:20:30.210 --> 01:20:33.510
She would work out all day like a beast and then she would eat this.

2901
01:20:33.870 --> 01:20:34.111
You know,

2902
01:20:34.111 --> 01:20:34.620
I think,

2903
01:20:34.620 --> 01:20:35.161
like I said,

2904
01:20:35.161 --> 01:20:36.360
some berries and some,

2905
01:20:36.361 --> 01:20:38.880
some light things and fruit juices and things during the day,

2906
01:20:38.881 --> 01:20:42.750
but her primary meal was a nighttime meal and she was having some great benefits

2907
01:20:42.751 --> 01:20:43.500
from it.

2908
01:20:43.500 --> 01:20:43.830
Yeah,

2909
01:20:43.830 --> 01:20:44.340
I think it,

2910
01:20:44.340 --> 01:20:44.731
you know what?

2911
01:20:44.731 --> 01:20:46.470
I think there's something to that and it's,

2912
01:20:46.920 --> 01:20:47.281
again,

2913
01:20:47.281 --> 01:20:49.220
it flies in the face of my bodybuilder.

2914
01:20:49.260 --> 01:20:49.980
Friends,

2915
01:20:49.980 --> 01:20:51.720
they want to eat the six meals per day.

2916
01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:52.530
Yeah.

2917
01:20:52.530 --> 01:20:55.020
And then take a protein shake in the middle of the night.

2918
01:20:55.080 --> 01:20:58.110
And I've also heard people say that when you eat many times a day,

2919
01:20:58.111 --> 01:20:58.921
that somehow or another,

2920
01:20:58.921 --> 01:21:00.600
it stimulates your metabolism.

2921
01:21:01.050 --> 01:21:01.883
But I don't,

2922
01:21:02.010 --> 01:21:05.830
I don't know what evidence there are or is that,

2923
01:21:05.860 --> 01:21:06.020
yeah,

2924
01:21:06.020 --> 01:21:06.960
I don't think there is.

2925
01:21:07.020 --> 01:21:09.570
There's so many different fucking schools of thought when it comes to diet and

2926
01:21:09.571 --> 01:21:10.404
exercise.

2927
01:21:10.510 --> 01:21:10.710
I mean,

2928
01:21:10.710 --> 01:21:11.760
remember when you were kids?

2929
01:21:12.250 --> 01:21:12.931
When we were kids,

2930
01:21:12.931 --> 01:21:14.490
they had the pyramid,

2931
01:21:14.491 --> 01:21:15.390
the food pyramid,

2932
01:21:15.630 --> 01:21:17.250
and the bottom was all grains.

2933
01:21:18.020 --> 01:21:18.361
I was like,

2934
01:21:18.361 --> 01:21:19.500
you need carbohydrates.

2935
01:21:19.501 --> 01:21:20.070
And now it's like,

2936
01:21:20.070 --> 01:21:20.431
hey,

2937
01:21:20.431 --> 01:21:21.510
did that bottom part,

2938
01:21:21.690 --> 01:21:22.530
the foundation?

2939
01:21:22.740 --> 01:21:23.281
Throw it out.

2940
01:21:23.281 --> 01:21:24.270
We don't need that at all.

2941
01:21:24.271 --> 01:21:25.104
Like what?

2942
01:21:25.350 --> 01:21:26.160
That's everything.

2943
01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:27.180
The grains are everything.

2944
01:21:27.210 --> 01:21:28.050
You need the rains?

2945
01:21:28.230 --> 01:21:29.063
No.

2946
01:21:29.310 --> 01:21:31.980
Well then there must be something to that six meals a day because I've seen a

2947
01:21:31.981 --> 01:21:35.520
lot of people get like really good physiques on that.

2948
01:21:35.910 --> 01:21:37.170
So I dunno.

2949
01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:41.970
I think the idea is that when you eat a lot of small meals that your body's

2950
01:21:41.971 --> 01:21:45.330
never working on stored food cause it's constantly getting new food.

2951
01:21:45.690 --> 01:21:47.940
And so that's what stimulates your body to go,

2952
01:21:47.941 --> 01:21:48.181
look,

2953
01:21:48.181 --> 01:21:51.540
we don't need all this fat cause we're getting food every fucking two hours.

2954
01:21:51.720 --> 01:21:55.710
So let's just get rid of all the fat and just live off this food.

2955
01:21:56.100 --> 01:21:56.341
Yeah.

2956
01:21:56.341 --> 01:21:57.540
It must be something like that.

2957
01:21:57.900 --> 01:22:01.620
Then you get into the hormones and things like that and it gets so complicated.

2958
01:22:01.621 --> 01:22:02.970
No wonder people get confused.

2959
01:22:03.210 --> 01:22:08.210
But do you do anything specifically like exercise wise to try to stimulate

2960
01:22:08.611 --> 01:22:10.170
growth hormone or testosterone?

2961
01:22:10.171 --> 01:22:14.780
Cause they say like really explosive exercises like Steve Maxwell is a,

2962
01:22:14.781 --> 01:22:16.260
a big proponent of that.

2963
01:22:16.261 --> 01:22:20.130
Like very specific exercises that are designed to stimulate your hormonal

2964
01:22:20.131 --> 01:22:20.830
system.

2965
01:22:20.830 --> 01:22:21.030
Yeah.

2966
01:22:21.030 --> 01:22:21.210
I,

2967
01:22:21.210 --> 01:22:22.650
that's why I love the double kettlebells.

2968
01:22:22.860 --> 01:22:23.693
Uh,

2969
01:22:23.730 --> 01:22:25.320
and that's my idea for the next video.

2970
01:22:25.500 --> 01:22:30.210
It's taken me a long time to figure out how to implement that and make,

2971
01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:34.950
make it so that you could actually have a video and follow along with two

2972
01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:37.070
kettlebells and uh,

2973
01:22:37.730 --> 01:22:38.250
uh,

2974
01:22:38.250 --> 01:22:39.840
which was what we were going to experiment with.

2975
01:22:39.841 --> 01:22:42.090
But your shoulder was sore.

2976
01:22:42.180 --> 01:22:43.740
So good Shah shoulder.

2977
01:22:44.260 --> 01:22:45.780
It has actually not bad.

2978
01:22:45.810 --> 01:22:47.280
Like I can do a lot of things with it.

2979
01:22:47.281 --> 01:22:48.114
I just don't,

2980
01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:51.180
I know too many people that have had shoulder surgery and that's a big one man

2981
01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:53.040
because it's such a complex joint.

2982
01:22:53.340 --> 01:22:55.200
It articulates in such weird ways.

2983
01:22:55.201 --> 01:23:00.090
It's so much different than just the hinge joint of the elbow or the knee or the

2984
01:23:00.091 --> 01:23:00.841
shoulder moves.

2985
01:23:00.841 --> 01:23:01.674
So I don't,

2986
01:23:01.770 --> 01:23:02.820
I don't fuck around with shoulder.

2987
01:23:02.930 --> 01:23:04.170
If I have any shoulder injuries,

2988
01:23:04.171 --> 01:23:05.130
I treat it right away.

2989
01:23:05.830 --> 01:23:08.530
The shoulder blade actually just look scapula.

2990
01:23:08.530 --> 01:23:10.060
It actually floats on our rib cage.

2991
01:23:10.210 --> 01:23:11.560
Like it's not actually attached to anything.

2992
01:23:12.100 --> 01:23:15.850
Muscles like the only thing that ti detaches are shoulder to our skeleton is

2993
01:23:15.851 --> 01:23:16.660
the,

2994
01:23:16.660 --> 01:23:17.493
this joint here,

2995
01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:18.970
these your collarbone.

2996
01:23:19.060 --> 01:23:20.680
It just connects everything.

2997
01:23:20.710 --> 01:23:21.543
It's amazing.

2998
01:23:22.610 --> 01:23:25.720
It's a very complex joint and it's not so good at getting beat up.

2999
01:23:26.340 --> 01:23:26.831
And then when,

3000
01:23:26.831 --> 01:23:29.110
when people start having like Forrest Griffin for me,

3001
01:23:29.111 --> 01:23:29.770
UFC fighter,

3002
01:23:29.770 --> 01:23:32.380
you can't even brush his teeth his right hand,

3003
01:23:32.410 --> 01:23:34.300
like literally can't brush his teeth his right hand,

3004
01:23:34.301 --> 01:23:38.470
he has to brush his teeth was left just from fucking shoulder up just from

3005
01:23:38.740 --> 01:23:40.000
fighting through pain.

3006
01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:40.390
Right.

3007
01:23:40.390 --> 01:23:40.961
That's a big one.

3008
01:23:40.961 --> 01:23:41.800
Cain Velasquez,

3009
01:23:41.801 --> 01:23:42.850
another perfect example.

3010
01:23:42.890 --> 01:23:44.020
UFC heavyweight champion.

3011
01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:45.460
I mean he's actually talked about it.

3012
01:23:45.461 --> 01:23:47.950
He's got such a high tolerance for pain because he's so tough.

3013
01:23:48.220 --> 01:23:51.250
It have an injury and I'll just work through it and then wind up needing surgery

3014
01:23:51.490 --> 01:23:53.200
cause he just tears his shit apart.

3015
01:23:53.710 --> 01:23:54.250
Yeah,

3016
01:23:54.250 --> 01:23:54.461
yeah.

3017
01:23:54.461 --> 01:23:55.050
That is,

3018
01:23:55.050 --> 01:23:56.740
they're just big balls of scar tissue.

3019
01:23:56.741 --> 01:23:57.550
And that's,

3020
01:23:57.550 --> 01:23:58.750
I see that every day,

3021
01:23:58.840 --> 01:24:00.730
probably to a lesser extent than these guys,

3022
01:24:00.731 --> 01:24:05.050
but to a smaller extent and just people that sit at a desk all day using a mouse

3023
01:24:05.051 --> 01:24:08.980
and the tissues actually adaptively short and it start to calcify.

3024
01:24:09.260 --> 01:24:12.340
So then they go and try to take up an exercise program or something and all of a

3025
01:24:12.341 --> 01:24:15.310
sudden they're tearing this tissue so they're always in pain.

3026
01:24:15.311 --> 01:24:17.920
So what's your thoughts on deep tissue massage,

3027
01:24:17.921 --> 01:24:19.570
rolfing and things along those lines?

3028
01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:24.790
I think that's what's made our clinic sort of a successful is we're one of the

3029
01:24:24.791 --> 01:24:29.680
few physios that that's what we specialize in versus some places they'll use a

3030
01:24:29.681 --> 01:24:31.810
lot of machines and fancy stuff like that.

3031
01:24:31.811 --> 01:24:32.644
And it's a,

3032
01:24:32.980 --> 01:24:33.850
it doesn't work as well.

3033
01:24:33.851 --> 01:24:37.060
It's just grabbing onto somebody and breaking that scar tissue out of there.

3034
01:24:37.660 --> 01:24:38.320
Especially if you,

3035
01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:39.370
they know what they're doing.

3036
01:24:39.371 --> 01:24:39.641
Man,

3037
01:24:39.641 --> 01:24:44.080
I've had people work on me that are good and I've had people work on me that

3038
01:24:44.081 --> 01:24:46.330
aren't so good and the really good people,

3039
01:24:46.331 --> 01:24:48.940
they can make a profound change in the way you feel.

3040
01:24:49.030 --> 01:24:53.710
Like if you have like a tense back or kinked up things or like a constant

3041
01:24:53.711 --> 01:24:54.760
reoccurring injury,

3042
01:24:54.970 --> 01:24:59.140
you'd be amazed at how much of it is just like a bound up area that can be

3043
01:24:59.141 --> 01:25:00.130
broken down.

3044
01:25:00.480 --> 01:25:01.630
Nothing a Graston.

3045
01:25:01.631 --> 01:25:04.870
I started doing that recently where they use metal.

3046
01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:05.080
Yeah.

3047
01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:07.240
Sort of a rolfing with like metal tools,

3048
01:25:07.330 --> 01:25:08.163
right?

3049
01:25:08.620 --> 01:25:09.453
Not,

3050
01:25:09.590 --> 01:25:10.570
it doesn't feel good.

3051
01:25:10.730 --> 01:25:10.961
No,

3052
01:25:10.961 --> 01:25:12.700
but it feels great after it's done.

3053
01:25:12.701 --> 01:25:13.050
Yeah.

3054
01:25:13.050 --> 01:25:13.360
Yeah.

3055
01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:14.560
Well you're getting in and that's,

3056
01:25:14.590 --> 01:25:19.450
that tissue is hypersensitive like 24 seven it's just full of lactic acid and

3057
01:25:19.451 --> 01:25:20.920
those no c receptors,

3058
01:25:20.921 --> 01:25:23.740
those pain receptors are just constantly sensitized.

3059
01:25:23.740 --> 01:25:24.520
So,

3060
01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:25.690
and that stuff just stays in there.

3061
01:25:25.691 --> 01:25:29.200
It's like tartar on your teeth unless someone gets in there and blast that out

3062
01:25:29.201 --> 01:25:29.830
of there for you.

3063
01:25:29.830 --> 01:25:31.640
It's amazing though that you can do that,

3064
01:25:31.641 --> 01:25:32.041
that you,

3065
01:25:32.041 --> 01:25:32.360
you the,

3066
01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:33.400
the human body,

3067
01:25:33.430 --> 01:25:38.170
you can actually change the way it feels to the person by just digging into the

3068
01:25:38.171 --> 01:25:42.700
muscle tissue and breaking it down is elbowing into it and pulling and

3069
01:25:42.701 --> 01:25:43.121
stretching.

3070
01:25:43.121 --> 01:25:44.650
Like I have this guy who does,

3071
01:25:44.950 --> 01:25:46.360
he's brutal man.

3072
01:25:46.361 --> 01:25:46.800
I mean he's,

3073
01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:47.560
he's,

3074
01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:49.270
it's unbelievably painful,

3075
01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:51.040
but when it's over,

3076
01:25:51.041 --> 01:25:53.860
everything just feels like completely relaxed.

3077
01:25:53.861 --> 01:25:57.880
Like all these tents areas and I got to think that's got to be tremendous for

3078
01:25:57.881 --> 01:25:58.210
healing.

3079
01:25:58.210 --> 01:25:59.043
Oh yeah.

3080
01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:02.140
And what's happened is the Fascia has healed together.

3081
01:26:02.141 --> 01:26:04.100
So you're dealing with a

3082
01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:05.870
<v 1>muscle fibers that are,</v>

3083
01:26:06.020 --> 01:26:06.853
they've healed,

3084
01:26:06.860 --> 01:26:07.693
they're healthy,

3085
01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:09.260
but it's that covering around them.

3086
01:26:09.290 --> 01:26:11.300
It's literally glued together,

3087
01:26:11.301 --> 01:26:13.670
calcified together and like get fibrotic state.

3088
01:26:13.730 --> 01:26:17.600
So if you can find somebody that works that to the point where it actually

3089
01:26:17.601 --> 01:26:18.321
breaks apart,

3090
01:26:18.321 --> 01:26:21.080
it feels amazing and it'll continue.

3091
01:26:21.110 --> 01:26:24.140
It'll allow you to keep training and not keep reinjuring that spot.

3092
01:26:24.230 --> 01:26:24.671
<v 2>So yeah,</v>

3093
01:26:24.671 --> 01:26:25.330
that's where it,

3094
01:26:25.330 --> 01:26:26.800
rolfing actually came from.

3095
01:26:26.801 --> 01:26:28.750
That woman who created Rolfing,

3096
01:26:28.751 --> 01:26:33.751
I believe her son had cerebral palsy and she created it to manipulate a soft

3097
01:26:34.961 --> 01:26:36.850
tissue to give him more range of motion,

3098
01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:38.110
give him more,

3099
01:26:38.140 --> 01:26:38.950
more um,

3100
01:26:38.950 --> 01:26:40.150
a pain free life.

3101
01:26:40.270 --> 01:26:41.050
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

3102
01:26:41.050 --> 01:26:42.040
It works like a charm.

3103
01:26:43.010 --> 01:26:44.630
<v 2>So when you do that stuff,</v>

3104
01:26:44.631 --> 01:26:45.530
how often do you do it?

3105
01:26:46.370 --> 01:26:47.203
<v 1>Uh,</v>

3106
01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:49.890
what like on other people or on yourself?

3107
01:26:49.891 --> 01:26:50.910
How often you have it done?

3108
01:26:51.060 --> 01:26:53.730
I try for once every couple of weeks.

3109
01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:54.510
That's it.

3110
01:26:54.510 --> 01:26:54.870
Yeah.

3111
01:26:54.870 --> 01:26:55.360
Really?

3112
01:26:55.360 --> 01:26:55.950
Yeah.

3113
01:26:55.950 --> 01:26:58.710
Cause if you get rid of it really thoroughly,

3114
01:26:59.160 --> 01:26:59.401
uh,

3115
01:26:59.401 --> 01:27:02.160
I've gone through spells where I've had sort of two treatments a week for

3116
01:27:02.161 --> 01:27:02.760
awhile,

3117
01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:04.450
but once you get that crap out of there,

3118
01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:05.753
it's gone.

3119
01:27:05.880 --> 01:27:06.713
Like I,

3120
01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:10.410
I had a job tree planting for eight summers while I went through university.

3121
01:27:10.710 --> 01:27:11.543
And uh,

3122
01:27:11.580 --> 01:27:13.200
it's a very one sided job.

3123
01:27:13.260 --> 01:27:13.980
It's,

3124
01:27:13.980 --> 01:27:16.080
you got the shovel in your right hand,

3125
01:27:16.081 --> 01:27:17.850
you're kicking the tree and with your right foot,

3126
01:27:18.060 --> 01:27:20.790
you're planning literally thousands of trees a day and you're walking up

3127
01:27:20.791 --> 01:27:22.320
mountains with these bags,

3128
01:27:22.321 --> 01:27:23.820
that trees and it's uh,

3129
01:27:24.180 --> 01:27:26.130
it's an intense job but you get paid per tree.

3130
01:27:26.190 --> 01:27:29.790
So there's a lot of incentive there to work your butt off.

3131
01:27:29.860 --> 01:27:30.081
I said,

3132
01:27:30.081 --> 01:27:31.350
why not just switch sides?

3133
01:27:32.190 --> 01:27:32.761
It's really,

3134
01:27:32.761 --> 01:27:33.350
it's,

3135
01:27:33.350 --> 01:27:36.570
it's almost like a writing or something.

3136
01:27:36.571 --> 01:27:37.980
When you get good with that shovel,

3137
01:27:38.370 --> 01:27:39.360
you can like weasel in,

3138
01:27:39.361 --> 01:27:42.030
in between rocks or find like the little patch of soil.

3139
01:27:42.031 --> 01:27:45.630
You look for a little blade of grass to slam that shovel into cause you're,

3140
01:27:45.810 --> 01:27:46.980
it's all about economy.

3141
01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:47.581
Now.

3142
01:27:47.581 --> 01:27:51.120
I do know a few guys that messed up their dominant hand and had to learn with

3143
01:27:51.121 --> 01:27:54.930
the left hand and they actually did after about a week of making no money,

3144
01:27:54.931 --> 01:27:59.430
they actually started doing the brain almost just like the brain plasticity,

3145
01:27:59.460 --> 01:28:00.720
hey kicked in and they're like,

3146
01:28:00.780 --> 01:28:01.411
oh my God.

3147
01:28:01.411 --> 01:28:04.710
So from then on it and they could like take all the trees out of this bag,

3148
01:28:04.711 --> 01:28:06.630
switch hands and take.

3149
01:28:06.660 --> 01:28:09.660
So I always thought that'd be a good idea to do but I never did.

3150
01:28:10.010 --> 01:28:10.251
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

3151
01:28:10.251 --> 01:28:15.140
they say that when you use the dominant side only on any sort of like a,

3152
01:28:15.141 --> 01:28:17.030
like Steve Maxwell had a,

3153
01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:17.750
uh,

3154
01:28:17.750 --> 01:28:21.200
he had a comparison when it was coming to a people that work in football,

3155
01:28:21.201 --> 01:28:24.920
the kickers that these kickers are always kicking with the right side and that

3156
01:28:24.921 --> 01:28:28.370
they were really getting all these weird back pains and all these strains and

3157
01:28:28.371 --> 01:28:30.860
the left leg and all they had to do to get rid of it.

3158
01:28:30.861 --> 01:28:33.940
We start kicking with the left side so they kick an equal number of times with

3159
01:28:33.941 --> 01:28:34.551
the left side.

3160
01:28:34.551 --> 01:28:39.551
And then it was also discovered that when you exercise your non dominant hand,

3161
01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:42.830
like if you're doing something with your nondominant hand,

3162
01:28:43.130 --> 01:28:46.250
it actually makes the dominant hand skill set better.

3163
01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:48.320
Like your understanding of whatever you're trying to do,

3164
01:28:48.321 --> 01:28:52.430
whether it's like executing punches or doing martial arts techniques or

3165
01:28:52.431 --> 01:28:53.480
something along those lines.

3166
01:28:53.690 --> 01:28:55.340
When you deal with your nondominant side,

3167
01:28:55.341 --> 01:28:56.870
it actually makes your dominant side better.

3168
01:28:57.540 --> 01:28:57.811
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

3169
01:28:57.811 --> 01:28:58.800
There's even studies,

3170
01:28:58.801 --> 01:28:59.610
uh,

3171
01:28:59.610 --> 01:29:02.010
taking people in a cast and

3172
01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:06.180
<v 3>taking their other arm and lifting weights while this arm's in a cast and he</v>

3173
01:29:06.181 --> 01:29:09.510
found at the end of four weeks or six weeks or however long it takes those

3174
01:29:09.511 --> 01:29:10.500
muscles to atrophy,

3175
01:29:10.860 --> 01:29:11.840
they've actually lost,

3176
01:29:11.910 --> 01:29:13.560
lost almost no muscle mass.

3177
01:29:13.740 --> 01:29:15.030
Well I don't even move that arm.

3178
01:29:15.150 --> 01:29:15.660
It's crazy.

3179
01:29:15.660 --> 01:29:20.580
Even people visualizing working out without RM while it's in a cast shows

3180
01:29:20.581 --> 01:29:23.130
significant improvements in muscle atrophy.

3181
01:29:23.280 --> 01:29:23.671
Really?

3182
01:29:23.671 --> 01:29:24.120
Yeah.

3183
01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:27.510
Visualizing exercise that will win.

3184
01:29:27.540 --> 01:29:28.860
That would make sense.

3185
01:29:28.861 --> 01:29:33.570
I gas cause your body like thinks it's going to do something and so it like

3186
01:29:33.571 --> 01:29:35.130
fires up those receptors.

3187
01:29:35.580 --> 01:29:35.761
No,

3188
01:29:35.761 --> 01:29:36.594
it doesn't make sense.

3189
01:29:36.750 --> 01:29:36.931
Wait.

3190
01:29:36.931 --> 01:29:37.800
It's hard to believe.

3191
01:29:37.801 --> 01:29:38.634
Right.

3192
01:29:38.950 --> 01:29:41.100
Things like watching sports or make you better at sports.

3193
01:29:41.810 --> 01:29:42.361
I get it.

3194
01:29:42.361 --> 01:29:44.160
Process probably does though a little bit.

3195
01:29:44.780 --> 01:29:45.020
Yeah.

3196
01:29:45.020 --> 01:29:46.020
You in mirror,

3197
01:29:46.021 --> 01:29:48.780
you mirror what the athletes are doing and you also,

3198
01:29:49.380 --> 01:29:50.213
you sort of,

3199
01:29:50.260 --> 01:29:50.990
uh,

3200
01:29:50.990 --> 01:29:53.100
I think martial arts like watch,

3201
01:29:53.101 --> 01:29:57.420
it's very important if you're in a gym to watch like the best guys watch like

3202
01:29:57.421 --> 01:30:01.860
the really high level guys kick and punch and do you know Jujitsu moves because

3203
01:30:01.861 --> 01:30:03.810
you see what it should look like.

3204
01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:04.110
Yeah.

3205
01:30:04.110 --> 01:30:06.870
What itch and it gives you like a high level to aspire to.

3206
01:30:07.410 --> 01:30:08.040
Yeah.

3207
01:30:08.040 --> 01:30:08.281
Yeah.

3208
01:30:08.281 --> 01:30:09.114
It's uh,

3209
01:30:09.300 --> 01:30:12.660
I have a theory about we're big on the NHL in Canada.

3210
01:30:12.690 --> 01:30:13.330
We love hot.

3211
01:30:13.330 --> 01:30:14.163
I never heard that.

3212
01:30:14.820 --> 01:30:16.020
Canadians like hockey.

3213
01:30:16.290 --> 01:30:16.501
Yeah,

3214
01:30:16.501 --> 01:30:16.971
we love it.

3215
01:30:16.971 --> 01:30:19.920
You don't say we're actually going to the La Kings game on Sunday.

3216
01:30:19.921 --> 01:30:21.270
My son is just over the moon.

3217
01:30:22.140 --> 01:30:22.973
Um,

3218
01:30:23.580 --> 01:30:24.151
but anyway,

3219
01:30:24.151 --> 01:30:29.151
I think that hockey nowadays is so much better because they've got that screen

3220
01:30:29.310 --> 01:30:29.820
to look at.

3221
01:30:29.820 --> 01:30:31.680
They look at me please constantly,

3222
01:30:31.681 --> 01:30:34.260
every time you see them looking up at what they just did.

3223
01:30:34.261 --> 01:30:36.180
And I think I'm not going to do that again.

3224
01:30:36.840 --> 01:30:38.130
I think there must be something to that.

3225
01:30:38.131 --> 01:30:39.270
Cause hockey nowadays.

3226
01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:44.360
I watched the 1987 Canada Cup where Canada beat Russia and yeah,

3227
01:30:45.090 --> 01:30:45.960
I mean these guys were,

3228
01:30:45.961 --> 01:30:49.260
this is Wayne Gretzky and Mario Lemieux and the best hockey players and it

3229
01:30:49.261 --> 01:30:50.700
looked brutal compared to,

3230
01:30:50.701 --> 01:30:51.534
uh,

3231
01:30:51.630 --> 01:30:52.580
what it is nowadays.

3232
01:30:52.750 --> 01:30:53.550
My way,

3233
01:30:53.550 --> 01:30:57.180
I'll just slower a slower for one thing,

3234
01:30:57.690 --> 01:30:59.280
the shots were weaker.

3235
01:30:59.281 --> 01:31:01.170
The it just a slower game.

3236
01:31:01.171 --> 01:31:04.350
It was almost like watching one of our Bierly games compared to what it is

3237
01:31:04.351 --> 01:31:04.890
nowadays.

3238
01:31:04.890 --> 01:31:05.723
Not Crazy.

3239
01:31:05.940 --> 01:31:06.773
Yeah.

3240
01:31:07.140 --> 01:31:09.390
But that's how it is with sports when,

3241
01:31:09.391 --> 01:31:09.691
you know,

3242
01:31:09.691 --> 01:31:10.524
there's always enough,

3243
01:31:10.770 --> 01:31:12.270
there's always innovation.

3244
01:31:12.330 --> 01:31:16.500
There's always the training methods are expanding and getting better and where

3245
01:31:16.510 --> 01:31:18.390
there's the understanding of the human body,

3246
01:31:18.510 --> 01:31:23.510
that's kind of a unique thing about what you do because exercise and training

3247
01:31:24.331 --> 01:31:26.010
and strength and conditioning training,

3248
01:31:26.220 --> 01:31:26.750
it's,

3249
01:31:26.750 --> 01:31:31.620
it's a constantly evolving business and a constantly evolving discipline.

3250
01:31:32.070 --> 01:31:32.881
That's so interesting.

3251
01:31:32.881 --> 01:31:34.830
There's so much information out there and it's just,

3252
01:31:35.310 --> 01:31:36.143
I love reading it.

3253
01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:37.320
It's so interesting.

3254
01:31:37.800 --> 01:31:41.810
If you were going to like save someone like a Jason McDonald or saved like Rory

3255
01:31:41.810 --> 01:31:41.811
Mcdonald's,

3256
01:31:41.811 --> 01:31:43.080
some MMA athlete,

3257
01:31:43.081 --> 01:31:45.510
a high level athlete came to you and uh,

3258
01:31:45.511 --> 01:31:47.430
wanted to improve their strength and conditioning,

3259
01:31:47.431 --> 01:31:49.860
how would you approach like training someone like that?

3260
01:31:50.490 --> 01:31:50.820
Well,

3261
01:31:50.820 --> 01:31:51.180
you know,

3262
01:31:51.180 --> 01:31:52.013
I'd look at what,

3263
01:31:52.720 --> 01:31:54.870
cause these guys are such high level athletes,

3264
01:31:54.871 --> 01:31:58.660
I would look at what they're lacking when they feel like they're lacking,

3265
01:31:58.661 --> 01:32:00.040
like maybe something in their

3266
01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:01.270
<v 1>ground game that's lacking.</v>

3267
01:32:01.271 --> 01:32:03.050
Or maybe they want more power with their strikes and,

3268
01:32:03.370 --> 01:32:06.670
and give them just enough to enhance what they're doing,

3269
01:32:06.671 --> 01:32:11.050
but not so much that it's causing them injury or taking away from what they're

3270
01:32:11.320 --> 01:32:11.561
doing.

3271
01:32:11.561 --> 01:32:12.394
Cause I think there's,

3272
01:32:12.490 --> 01:32:15.210
overtraining is probably quite prevalent nowadays.

3273
01:32:15.330 --> 01:32:16.290
<v 2>It's very prevalent.</v>

3274
01:32:16.500 --> 01:32:17.020
It's Ah,

3275
01:32:17.020 --> 01:32:20.970
it's all overtraining is also prevalent because there's this mindset that more

3276
01:32:20.971 --> 01:32:21.620
is better.

3277
01:32:21.620 --> 01:32:21.990
Yeah.

3278
01:32:21.990 --> 01:32:23.370
And that you just need to be tougher.

3279
01:32:23.580 --> 01:32:25.170
He just need to keep pushing,

3280
01:32:25.171 --> 01:32:26.490
keep pushing and more is better.

3281
01:32:26.491 --> 01:32:28.260
But if your body is not recovering,

3282
01:32:28.440 --> 01:32:30.930
you're not doing any good by keeping going,

3283
01:32:31.160 --> 01:32:34.650
you were actually doing damage because you're giving your body more of a war.

3284
01:32:34.680 --> 01:32:36.720
It's like that you have to have that fine line.

3285
01:32:36.840 --> 01:32:40.740
You don't want to give your body like a low low workload where it doesn't

3286
01:32:40.741 --> 01:32:43.740
actually reach a high level of intensity and conditioning,

3287
01:32:44.100 --> 01:32:47.600
but you don't want to give it so much that it never reaches a,

3288
01:32:47.601 --> 01:32:51.360
a period of recovery that is always constantly dealing with a deficit.

3289
01:32:51.860 --> 01:32:52.220
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

3290
01:32:52.220 --> 01:32:56.870
And I think these guys are always riding that thin edge so you have to be really

3291
01:32:56.871 --> 01:32:58.670
careful before you start integrating

3292
01:32:59.380 --> 01:32:59.861
<v 2>something.</v>

3293
01:32:59.861 --> 01:33:01.630
So if you have an athlete that came to you and said,

3294
01:33:01.631 --> 01:33:02.360
listen man,

3295
01:33:02.360 --> 01:33:02.920
I'm,

3296
01:33:02.920 --> 01:33:04.300
my power's fine.

3297
01:33:04.330 --> 01:33:05.260
It's not my issue.

3298
01:33:05.470 --> 01:33:06.790
My issue is conditioning.

3299
01:33:06.820 --> 01:33:11.020
I want to be able to have a full gas tank from the first minute of the first

3300
01:33:11.021 --> 01:33:11.471
round.

3301
01:33:11.471 --> 01:33:15.370
I want to be able to fight like that at the fifth round in the final minute.

3302
01:33:15.880 --> 01:33:16.031
Like,

3303
01:33:16.031 --> 01:33:16.211
what,

3304
01:33:16.211 --> 01:33:16.691
what do you,

3305
01:33:16.691 --> 01:33:16.870
uh,

3306
01:33:16.870 --> 01:33:17.970
what do you have them do for things like,

3307
01:33:17.971 --> 01:33:18.100
yeah,

3308
01:33:18.100 --> 01:33:18.850
<v 1>I would,</v>

3309
01:33:18.850 --> 01:33:20.220
I would recommend kettlebells,

3310
01:33:20.330 --> 01:33:20.640
like,

3311
01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:24.610
and that the type of training scenario that I've shown on the videos,

3312
01:33:24.910 --> 01:33:27.200
because I think it teaches you to like,

3313
01:33:27.330 --> 01:33:27.551
you know,

3314
01:33:27.551 --> 01:33:29.740
you do 10 thrusters per site in there,

3315
01:33:29.920 --> 01:33:30.551
you're winded,

3316
01:33:30.551 --> 01:33:33.790
but you have that little bit of a wiggle room where you can switch hands with

3317
01:33:33.791 --> 01:33:34.570
the kettle bell.

3318
01:33:34.570 --> 01:33:36.880
He can take a few deep breaths and then keep going.

3319
01:33:36.881 --> 01:33:40.450
And it's almost like you learn those respiratory muscles almost learning.

3320
01:33:40.451 --> 01:33:41.290
You learn how to like,

3321
01:33:41.291 --> 01:33:44.470
control that fatigue and keep breathing even through fatigue.

3322
01:33:44.471 --> 01:33:45.310
And meanwhile,

3323
01:33:45.311 --> 01:33:48.430
you're still doing the exercises so you're still exerting yourself.

3324
01:33:48.940 --> 01:33:49.900
But I love that kind of true.

3325
01:33:49.901 --> 01:33:53.590
I think that carries over so nicely to where you're maybe on the ground and

3326
01:33:53.591 --> 01:33:53.860
you're,

3327
01:33:53.860 --> 01:33:56.860
you're gassed and to get that quick recovery back.

3328
01:33:56.861 --> 01:33:58.870
So what about like flexibility,

3329
01:33:58.871 --> 01:34:00.580
training and range of motion training?

3330
01:34:00.640 --> 01:34:00.971
Do you,

3331
01:34:00.971 --> 01:34:01.690
uh,

3332
01:34:01.690 --> 01:34:02.050
uh,

3333
01:34:02.050 --> 01:34:02.890
and those kinds of things?

3334
01:34:02.980 --> 01:34:04.150
Well like to,

3335
01:34:04.151 --> 01:34:05.470
in order to do an overhead squat,

3336
01:34:05.471 --> 01:34:06.520
you have to be pretty flexible,

3337
01:34:06.940 --> 01:34:07.390
you know,

3338
01:34:07.390 --> 01:34:08.640
and to do a terrific job.

3339
01:34:08.740 --> 01:34:09.490
In what way?

3340
01:34:09.490 --> 01:34:09.671
Well,

3341
01:34:09.671 --> 01:34:10.504
to get deep,

3342
01:34:11.170 --> 01:34:12.003
flexible.

3343
01:34:12.100 --> 01:34:12.310
Yeah.

3344
01:34:12.310 --> 01:34:12.461
Look,

3345
01:34:12.461 --> 01:34:13.450
you have quads,

3346
01:34:13.540 --> 01:34:13.990
I guess.

3347
01:34:13.990 --> 01:34:14.711
Well you need your,

3348
01:34:14.711 --> 01:34:15.130
uh,

3349
01:34:15.130 --> 01:34:15.431
your,

3350
01:34:15.431 --> 01:34:15.521
uh,

3351
01:34:15.521 --> 01:34:16.060
doctors.

3352
01:34:16.060 --> 01:34:16.181
Hey,

3353
01:34:16.181 --> 01:34:17.830
you need to almost be able to do,

3354
01:34:18.070 --> 01:34:18.221
like,

3355
01:34:18.221 --> 01:34:20.800
I think if you did enough overhead squats like nice and deep,

3356
01:34:21.220 --> 01:34:21.371
uh,

3357
01:34:21.371 --> 01:34:23.230
you'd be able to get close to,

3358
01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:24.700
of doing a partial split.

3359
01:34:25.520 --> 01:34:28.550
<v 2>That's funny cause it never that issue.</v>

3360
01:34:28.700 --> 01:34:29.450
Um,

3361
01:34:29.450 --> 01:34:30.051
because of,

3362
01:34:30.051 --> 01:34:30.710
uh,

3363
01:34:30.710 --> 01:34:32.090
I did a lot of stretching when I was young,

3364
01:34:32.091 --> 01:34:33.350
so I've always been pretty flexible.

3365
01:34:33.351 --> 01:34:35.930
So I never felt like any flexible,

3366
01:34:36.350 --> 01:34:36.621
uh,

3367
01:34:36.621 --> 01:34:37.011
any,

3368
01:34:37.011 --> 01:34:37.430
um,

3369
01:34:37.430 --> 01:34:37.580
uh,

3370
01:34:37.580 --> 01:34:39.110
strain on my flexibility.

3371
01:34:39.111 --> 01:34:40.200
And when I do an overhead squats,

3372
01:34:40.220 --> 01:34:42.410
I would've never thought of it as a flexibility exercise.

3373
01:34:42.470 --> 01:34:42.651
<v 1>Well,</v>

3374
01:34:42.651 --> 01:34:45.080
and I'm busy working with people that are,

3375
01:34:45.890 --> 01:34:47.000
have never done anything,

3376
01:34:47.060 --> 01:34:50.600
so I can see how their squats improves so quickly.

3377
01:34:50.850 --> 01:34:51.230
Uh,

3378
01:34:51.230 --> 01:34:53.630
because a loaded up muscle will always stretch better.

3379
01:34:53.690 --> 01:34:55.550
So I can see people,

3380
01:34:55.640 --> 01:34:58.280
their first Kettlebell class doing these,

3381
01:34:58.790 --> 01:35:00.260
squats it or not that good.

3382
01:35:00.740 --> 01:35:02.900
And then after a couple sessions it's like,

3383
01:35:02.901 --> 01:35:03.441
Whoa,

3384
01:35:03.441 --> 01:35:04.370
where did that come from?

3385
01:35:04.371 --> 01:35:05.960
It opening up and opening up.

3386
01:35:05.961 --> 01:35:07.250
He was sitting up and that's what I,

3387
01:35:07.251 --> 01:35:07.670
that's,

3388
01:35:07.670 --> 01:35:09.830
that is one of my favorite exercise overhead squats.

3389
01:35:09.831 --> 01:35:13.760
Cause if you're not keeping those hips open and you're not doing your stretching

3390
01:35:13.761 --> 01:35:15.010
and you're not doing your strengthening,

3391
01:35:15.260 --> 01:35:16.610
that's a hard exercise.

3392
01:35:16.611 --> 01:35:17.001
That's like,

3393
01:35:17.001 --> 01:35:17.660
uh,

3394
01:35:17.660 --> 01:35:18.493
that's uh,

3395
01:35:18.500 --> 01:35:20.120
one of those exercises that tells you,

3396
01:35:20.210 --> 01:35:20.511
Oh yeah,

3397
01:35:20.511 --> 01:35:21.680
my programs on point.

3398
01:35:21.770 --> 01:35:22.310
It's good.

3399
01:35:22.310 --> 01:35:22.731
<v 2>Right?</v>

3400
01:35:22.731 --> 01:35:22.911
Yeah.

3401
01:35:22.911 --> 01:35:27.650
That's a really unique exercise too because it's so difficult to keep your arms

3402
01:35:27.651 --> 01:35:31.130
overhead and hold the weight up and drop all the way down when you're asked,

3403
01:35:31.131 --> 01:35:33.860
touches your heels and then straightened back up again.

3404
01:35:33.861 --> 01:35:36.800
It's such a core stabilization exercise.

3405
01:35:36.830 --> 01:35:37.420
Yup.

3406
01:35:37.420 --> 01:35:39.860
<v 1>And you can tell people with weak cores because a,</v>

3407
01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:43.000
they'll always get a cramp in the opposite side where they're,

3408
01:35:43.090 --> 01:35:44.890
if they're holding the kettle bell in their left hand,

3409
01:35:45.310 --> 01:35:48.620
their right quadratus lumborum will just seize up on them.

3410
01:35:48.640 --> 01:35:52.630
And so they haven't learned yet how to integrate the hip flexors and the

3411
01:35:52.631 --> 01:35:54.370
abdominals into getting that nice,

3412
01:35:54.790 --> 01:35:57.220
almost like your own weight training belt in the front.

3413
01:35:57.250 --> 01:36:00.580
So their QL takes all the load and that's probably how they go through life.

3414
01:36:00.581 --> 01:36:00.761
Right.

3415
01:36:00.761 --> 01:36:02.620
Every time they bend over to pick up groceries,

3416
01:36:03.530 --> 01:36:05.500
<v 2>they're is just doing all the work and they're not,</v>

3417
01:36:05.710 --> 01:36:07.360
I don't ever use weightlifting belts.

3418
01:36:07.660 --> 01:36:08.230
No,

3419
01:36:08.230 --> 01:36:08.620
I don't.

3420
01:36:08.620 --> 01:36:08.951
You know,

3421
01:36:08.951 --> 01:36:11.110
I had a trainer once that told me,

3422
01:36:11.111 --> 01:36:11.890
he goes,

3423
01:36:11.890 --> 01:36:13.690
if you need a weight lifting belt,

3424
01:36:13.691 --> 01:36:15.100
your w lift in too much weights.

3425
01:36:15.130 --> 01:36:15.300
Yeah.

3426
01:36:15.300 --> 01:36:17.890
Well you should do is just strengthen your back and your stomach muscles.

3427
01:36:17.950 --> 01:36:18.430
Yeah.

3428
01:36:18.430 --> 01:36:18.941
And uh,

3429
01:36:18.941 --> 01:36:23.290
I sort of took that to heart and I've never been a big heavyweight guy anyway.

3430
01:36:23.350 --> 01:36:25.180
I don't really lift that much heavyweight,

3431
01:36:25.181 --> 01:36:26.260
like the heaviest weight.

3432
01:36:26.261 --> 01:36:27.910
I lift a 70 pound kettle bells.

3433
01:36:27.990 --> 01:36:28.240
Yeah.

3434
01:36:28.240 --> 01:36:31.180
I just do one in each hand and I do most of my workouts like that.

3435
01:36:31.860 --> 01:36:31.960
Yeah,

3436
01:36:31.960 --> 01:36:32.560
that's a lot.

3437
01:36:32.560 --> 01:36:36.010
I mean that and just the leverage that those kettlebells provided,

3438
01:36:36.011 --> 01:36:37.180
they're trying to pull you forward.

3439
01:36:38.950 --> 01:36:39.850
That's a lot of weight.

3440
01:36:39.910 --> 01:36:43.210
It's my favorite is kettle bell squats with a 70 in each hand.

3441
01:36:43.510 --> 01:36:44.360
It's just you,

3442
01:36:44.380 --> 01:36:45.700
you're just so much,

3443
01:36:46.960 --> 01:36:50.050
so much like stabilization work when you're doing those things.

3444
01:36:50.350 --> 01:36:51.430
And I feel like when I,

3445
01:36:51.490 --> 01:36:55.990
I'm consistent and I do those once a week and I do it on a weekly basis for like

3446
01:36:55.991 --> 01:36:56.824
several months.

3447
01:36:56.890 --> 01:37:00.280
I just feel a big difference when I'm going to do like martial arts techniques.

3448
01:37:00.281 --> 01:37:04.360
I just feel a big difference in my ability to keep up the intensity like deep

3449
01:37:04.361 --> 01:37:05.141
into the browns.

3450
01:37:05.141 --> 01:37:05.974
Yeah.

3451
01:37:06.040 --> 01:37:06.520
Yeah.

3452
01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:07.091
To do those.

3453
01:37:07.091 --> 01:37:08.350
You're tensing everything.

3454
01:37:08.350 --> 01:37:08.550
Okay.

3455
01:37:08.550 --> 01:37:08.630
<v 1>Uh,</v>

3456
01:37:08.630 --> 01:37:10.490
you cannot relax for one minute.

3457
01:37:11.150 --> 01:37:12.640
It's a such a great,

3458
01:37:12.830 --> 01:37:15.560
so have you done double thrusters with maybe a lighter weight?

3459
01:37:15.580 --> 01:37:15.880
Yeah,

3460
01:37:15.880 --> 01:37:16.970
you have done double thrusters.

3461
01:37:16.971 --> 01:37:17.790
I love those.

3462
01:37:17.790 --> 01:37:19.130
Those and uh,

3463
01:37:19.550 --> 01:37:24.470
I mean I love to combine the double clean with the squat and I kind of got this

3464
01:37:24.471 --> 01:37:26.140
id off a trainer named Dan John,

3465
01:37:26.150 --> 01:37:28.790
you might've heard of him but he's into barbell complexes.

3466
01:37:29.450 --> 01:37:34.100
And so I've sort of taken a few of his ideas in order to length and note that

3467
01:37:34.220 --> 01:37:35.810
that set that you're using with it,

3468
01:37:35.811 --> 01:37:37.970
cause you get gas in a hurry with a double kettlebells.

3469
01:37:38.510 --> 01:37:41.720
So one of his favorite things is you do one clean one squat,

3470
01:37:41.900 --> 01:37:46.900
two cleans two squats up to five and doing that with two 24 hours is when you

3471
01:37:47.781 --> 01:37:49.960
get to like that five cleans and your,

3472
01:37:49.970 --> 01:37:52.160
you've already been like holding those kettlebells,

3473
01:37:52.220 --> 01:37:55.890
but it gives you just enough of a break that you can kind of get that last five

3474
01:37:55.950 --> 01:37:56.770
<v 2>24 is a,</v>

3475
01:37:56.770 --> 01:37:57.121
what does it,

3476
01:37:57.121 --> 01:37:57.954
52 pounds.

3477
01:37:59.070 --> 01:38:00.120
50 something pounds.

3478
01:38:00.460 --> 01:38:03.390
This kilograms pound conversions.

3479
01:38:03.450 --> 01:38:08.450
The funny thing is poohed like one pooed and two pood a come on.

3480
01:38:10.821 --> 01:38:11.654
What is it?

3481
01:38:12.060 --> 01:38:13.230
Who gives you 16 kilos?

3482
01:38:13.380 --> 01:38:14.213
I don't care.

3483
01:38:14.370 --> 01:38:14.880
Pounds.

3484
01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:15.713
America.

3485
01:38:16.380 --> 01:38:17.213
Eagles.

3486
01:38:18.120 --> 01:38:18.331
Yeah,

3487
01:38:18.331 --> 01:38:19.164
they two cars.

3488
01:38:20.440 --> 01:38:20.880
Pounds.

3489
01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:23.670
They switched us over to metric when I was about 10 years old.

3490
01:38:23.700 --> 01:38:27.090
They tried when I was in high school and they were giving it to us,

3491
01:38:27.150 --> 01:38:27.700
but nobody,

3492
01:38:27.700 --> 01:38:29.490
everybody was like whatever.

3493
01:38:30.180 --> 01:38:31.070
They tried for awhile,

3494
01:38:31.230 --> 01:38:35.820
they tried with soccer and they tried with the metric system from work.

3495
01:38:36.580 --> 01:38:38.790
Either one of them work soccer big in Canada.

3496
01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:41.020
<v 1>It's getting bigger.</v>

3497
01:38:41.180 --> 01:38:41.800
Yeah.

3498
01:38:41.800 --> 01:38:42.633
Um,

3499
01:38:42.880 --> 01:38:43.900
yeah and I think

3500
01:38:45.820 --> 01:38:47.860
partly because it's not that expensive,

3501
01:38:47.890 --> 01:38:49.660
completely hockey's expensive to play.

3502
01:38:49.860 --> 01:38:50.011
<v 2>Well,</v>

3503
01:38:50.011 --> 01:38:51.570
we were in Alaska this weekend.

3504
01:38:51.571 --> 01:38:53.550
My friend Martin who were up there,

3505
01:38:53.580 --> 01:38:56.730
he knows a lot about running and one of the things he was talking about was that

3506
01:38:56.731 --> 01:38:57.331
runners,

3507
01:38:57.331 --> 01:38:57.481
they're,

3508
01:38:57.481 --> 01:38:58.200
they're actually,

3509
01:38:58.200 --> 01:38:58.650
um,

3510
01:38:58.650 --> 01:39:01.800
there's a lot of people that believe that running and stretching,

3511
01:39:02.320 --> 01:39:05.100
it's like it's not necessary for runners to stretch.

3512
01:39:05.130 --> 01:39:05.963
Yep.

3513
01:39:06.020 --> 01:39:07.860
<v 1>And even the world champion,</v>

3514
01:39:07.870 --> 01:39:08.101
uh,

3515
01:39:08.101 --> 01:39:11.000
I think the top three guys in the world for triathlon right now,

3516
01:39:11.001 --> 01:39:13.580
and these are the guys that are doing the iron man distance.

3517
01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:14.570
They don't,

3518
01:39:14.570 --> 01:39:14.960
uh,

3519
01:39:14.960 --> 01:39:18.080
they admit to not stretching and the one guy's even a physiotherapist and no

3520
01:39:18.081 --> 01:39:18.914
stretching.

3521
01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:19.280
No,

3522
01:39:19.280 --> 01:39:20.113
I was

3523
01:39:20.250 --> 01:39:21.083
<v 2>confusing to me.</v>

3524
01:39:21.180 --> 01:39:24.140
I always thought that range of motion was like super important and it's

3525
01:39:24.141 --> 01:39:24.571
stretched.

3526
01:39:24.571 --> 01:39:26.220
Muscles were healthy muscles.

3527
01:39:26.590 --> 01:39:26.771
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

3528
01:39:26.771 --> 01:39:28.900
I just took a course from Stuart Mcgill,

3529
01:39:28.930 --> 01:39:29.800
I don't know if you've heard of him.

3530
01:39:29.801 --> 01:39:31.150
He's a Canadian guy,

3531
01:39:31.750 --> 01:39:33.160
but he's actually world-renown now.

3532
01:39:33.161 --> 01:39:35.410
And he wrote the book low back disorders a few years ago,

3533
01:39:35.411 --> 01:39:36.550
but he was the first guy.

3534
01:39:36.760 --> 01:39:38.320
He's actually a mechanical engineer.

3535
01:39:38.860 --> 01:39:43.690
And so what he's doing is a hooking electrodes like deep needles into people,

3536
01:39:43.691 --> 01:39:48.691
so as muscles and putting a trans force transducers on their actual spinal bones

3537
01:39:49.330 --> 01:39:51.400
and doing studies and he works on animals too.

3538
01:39:51.910 --> 01:39:55.330
And he's taking these exercises that we've given and he's actually measuring the

3539
01:39:55.331 --> 01:39:59.140
force that the muscles produce compared to the sheer in force in the compressive

3540
01:39:59.141 --> 01:40:01.570
force when we're doing these different exercises.

3541
01:40:02.230 --> 01:40:04.750
And from all of his research,

3542
01:40:04.751 --> 01:40:08.410
he's finally been sort of indicated like a lot of people when he first came out,

3543
01:40:08.411 --> 01:40:11.260
like there used to be a thing in physio where if you want your back to be

3544
01:40:11.261 --> 01:40:11.920
strong,

3545
01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:13.510
pull your belly button back to your backbone.

3546
01:40:13.720 --> 01:40:16.570
That's the best thing you can do cause it's going to engage the transverse

3547
01:40:16.571 --> 01:40:17.404
abdominis.

3548
01:40:17.860 --> 01:40:19.180
And he uh,

3549
01:40:19.390 --> 01:40:21.340
he blew that theory out of the water,

3550
01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:22.840
the transverse abdominis.

3551
01:40:22.841 --> 01:40:26.170
Actually we'll co contract when you take,

3552
01:40:26.171 --> 01:40:29.560
do that Valsalva maneuver when you're at the bottom of a squat and you come up

3553
01:40:29.890 --> 01:40:30.340
that,

3554
01:40:30.340 --> 01:40:31.540
that transverse abdominis,

3555
01:40:31.541 --> 01:40:34.480
it's almost like the rotator cuff will contract really hard if you make a tight

3556
01:40:34.481 --> 01:40:35.314
fist and do that.

3557
01:40:35.320 --> 01:40:36.030
So,

3558
01:40:36.030 --> 01:40:36.863
um,

3559
01:40:37.300 --> 01:40:37.541
anyway,

3560
01:40:37.541 --> 01:40:38.250
I'm getting off.

3561
01:40:38.250 --> 01:40:38.460
<v 2>No,</v>

3562
01:40:38.460 --> 01:40:38.930
please go out.

3563
01:40:38.930 --> 01:40:40.160
He blew it out of the water.

3564
01:40:40.180 --> 01:40:40.980
How so?

3565
01:40:40.980 --> 01:40:41.191
<v 1>Well,</v>

3566
01:40:41.191 --> 01:40:41.610
he really,

3567
01:40:41.610 --> 01:40:46.230
he realized that the transverse abdominis doesn't engage by tensing up here.

3568
01:40:46.620 --> 01:40:48.060
Your sphincter muscles a year.

3569
01:40:48.270 --> 01:40:51.050
You're black and you're pulling your belly belly button back.

3570
01:40:51.720 --> 01:40:52.553
It doesn't.

3571
01:40:52.900 --> 01:40:53.170
Hmm.

3572
01:40:53.170 --> 01:40:54.003
So,

3573
01:40:54.350 --> 01:40:55.430
<v 3>and I,</v>

3574
01:40:55.480 --> 01:40:55.900
they,

3575
01:40:55.900 --> 01:40:56.980
I think it came,

3576
01:40:56.981 --> 01:41:00.440
there was a study in Australia many years ago where they were doing an

3577
01:41:00.450 --> 01:41:01.870
ultrasound studies of people's,

3578
01:41:01.871 --> 01:41:03.250
so us muscles and they found it.

3579
01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:03.911
There was some,

3580
01:41:03.911 --> 01:41:05.830
so s and multifidus activation,

3581
01:41:05.831 --> 01:41:06.940
when you pull,

3582
01:41:06.970 --> 01:41:10.000
did the specific exercise [inaudible] police pulling the belly button back

3583
01:41:10.001 --> 01:41:10.751
towards your spine.

3584
01:41:10.751 --> 01:41:11.584
So,

3585
01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:13.120
so don't do that if you lift heavy.

3586
01:41:13.300 --> 01:41:14.080
Hmm.

3587
01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:15.190
So what should you do?

3588
01:41:15.191 --> 01:41:17.550
Just tighten up everything and Chitin posture.

3589
01:41:17.610 --> 01:41:17.890
Yes.

3590
01:41:17.890 --> 01:41:18.671
And tighten everything up.

3591
01:41:18.671 --> 01:41:19.540
Like they,

3592
01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:21.610
they call it breathing against the shield.

3593
01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:22.593
Uh,

3594
01:41:23.520 --> 01:41:26.340
or that don't suck in don't second.

3595
01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:28.690
That's sucking Adams isn't a weird though.

3596
01:41:28.691 --> 01:41:30.430
Would things like become common practice?

3597
01:41:30.431 --> 01:41:34.150
Then it turns out there were horse shit then everybody sort of abandons him.

3598
01:41:34.360 --> 01:41:34.811
Yeah.

3599
01:41:34.811 --> 01:41:35.120
In the,

3600
01:41:35.120 --> 01:41:35.640
you know,

3601
01:41:35.640 --> 01:41:36.880
but a lot of these things,

3602
01:41:36.881 --> 01:41:40.180
they all kind of prove if you'd have done some lifting,

3603
01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:41.380
what you kind of knew.

3604
01:41:41.590 --> 01:41:45.820
Like it just feels unnatural I think to like to pull your belly button back to

3605
01:41:45.821 --> 01:41:46.181
your spine.

3606
01:41:46.181 --> 01:41:48.700
If I'm doing yoga it feels right.

3607
01:41:48.970 --> 01:41:50.530
But if I'm lifting a heavy weight,

3608
01:41:50.531 --> 01:41:51.364
I want to,

3609
01:41:51.470 --> 01:41:52.040
you know,

3610
01:41:52.040 --> 01:41:53.680
tense up and get everything tight.

3611
01:41:53.980 --> 01:41:54.131
Right.

3612
01:41:54.131 --> 01:41:57.220
If you're doing yoga and you're doing those crazy breath things like you're

3613
01:41:57.221 --> 01:41:58.570
seeing Hixon Gracie's choke,

3614
01:41:58.630 --> 01:41:59.560
they were sending documentary.

3615
01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:00.370
No,

3616
01:42:00.370 --> 01:42:00.820
no.

3617
01:42:00.820 --> 01:42:01.580
How dare you,

3618
01:42:01.580 --> 01:42:03.280
you need to give that documentary right now.

3619
01:42:03.610 --> 01:42:07.660
And he does these crazy breathing exercises where,

3620
01:42:07.661 --> 01:42:07.961
you know,

3621
01:42:07.961 --> 01:42:12.610
he's like sucking his stomach in like all the way and moving it around like back

3622
01:42:12.611 --> 01:42:13.360
and forth.

3623
01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:14.550
You ever seen anybody do that?

3624
01:42:14.680 --> 01:42:18.190
I guess like you can cure constipation with that kind of thing really.

3625
01:42:18.280 --> 01:42:19.720
Or x locks a cup of coffee,

3626
01:42:20.110 --> 01:42:20.943
you can get crazy.

3627
01:42:22.120 --> 01:42:22.331
Yeah.

3628
01:42:22.331 --> 01:42:23.550
But I guess they can actually tie it.

3629
01:42:23.560 --> 01:42:24.393
You fucking,

3630
01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:26.111
but yeah,

3631
01:42:26.111 --> 01:42:30.250
I guess they can actually manipulate the waste products through the large

3632
01:42:30.251 --> 01:42:33.040
intestine and using their own abdominal muscles kind of makes sense.

3633
01:42:33.050 --> 01:42:33.251
You know,

3634
01:42:33.251 --> 01:42:34.690
you're pushing everything around,

3635
01:42:34.750 --> 01:42:35.340
you know,

3636
01:42:35.340 --> 01:42:38.980
it kind of seems like it would aid in digestion.

3637
01:42:39.220 --> 01:42:39.630
You know,

3638
01:42:39.630 --> 01:42:43.960
some people have this idea that you should eat like I'm smoothies in the morning

3639
01:42:44.530 --> 01:42:46.780
because smoothies like vegetable smoothies especially,

3640
01:42:46.781 --> 01:42:51.070
they're sort of lube up the pathway and then everything calming afterwards,

3641
01:42:51.071 --> 01:42:51.611
we'll have a,

3642
01:42:51.611 --> 01:42:53.470
an easy ride through the,

3643
01:42:53.620 --> 01:42:57.640
through the body's digestive system that that sounds feasible.

3644
01:42:57.860 --> 01:42:58.360
Yeah.

3645
01:42:58.360 --> 01:43:01.850
So why doesn't the stretching getting back to that story.

3646
01:43:01.870 --> 01:43:04.420
So he's all about the concept of super stiffness.

3647
01:43:05.510 --> 01:43:05.921
It's thing,

3648
01:43:05.921 --> 01:43:07.390
it's a term he might have coined,

3649
01:43:07.391 --> 01:43:09.550
but he's with athletes,

3650
01:43:09.580 --> 01:43:13.060
he's all about having the core stiff so that,

3651
01:43:13.510 --> 01:43:16.630
and I don't mean stiff where you can't pick you up your wallet or something,

3652
01:43:16.631 --> 01:43:20.710
but stiff to the point where it's always sort of all these abdominal and

3653
01:43:20.711 --> 01:43:24.340
postural muscles are on high alert so that when you do throw a punch or

3654
01:43:24.341 --> 01:43:25.030
something there,

3655
01:43:25.030 --> 01:43:26.110
they kick in all at once.

3656
01:43:26.740 --> 01:43:29.200
And he claims that from his studies,

3657
01:43:29.530 --> 01:43:32.530
excessive stretching of the core and the hips and the shoulders,

3658
01:43:32.910 --> 01:43:35.440
you lose that nice a tightness,

3659
01:43:35.470 --> 01:43:36.303
you lose that,

3660
01:43:36.430 --> 01:43:41.430
that nice normal sort of resiliency between the core in the extremities.

3661
01:43:41.890 --> 01:43:42.723
That's interesting.

3662
01:43:42.790 --> 01:43:43.560
But,

3663
01:43:43.560 --> 01:43:47.680
well the only thing that I would take issue with is that I think that a lot of

3664
01:43:47.681 --> 01:43:51.040
power comes from the range of motion and the flexibility.

3665
01:43:51.050 --> 01:43:51.980
Like especially when it comes

3666
01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:52.813
<v 2>to kicking.</v>

3667
01:43:52.940 --> 01:43:53.450
Yeah.

3668
01:43:53.450 --> 01:43:54.380
Like that's all.

3669
01:43:54.381 --> 01:43:56.470
Like whipping the body around like the,

3670
01:43:56.490 --> 01:44:00.860
there's a lot of power involved and having a a long range of motion.

3671
01:44:01.090 --> 01:44:01.281
<v 1>Well,</v>

3672
01:44:01.281 --> 01:44:02.500
and his thing is,

3673
01:44:02.600 --> 01:44:02.980
uh,

3674
01:44:02.980 --> 01:44:04.240
your course should be stiff,

3675
01:44:04.690 --> 01:44:06.910
but if you are in a kicking sport,

3676
01:44:07.360 --> 01:44:08.193
you need to have the,

3677
01:44:08.260 --> 01:44:09.093
the hips,

3678
01:44:09.240 --> 01:44:10.300
the hips need to be,

3679
01:44:10.660 --> 01:44:12.140
<v 2>your core is a big Po.</v>

3680
01:44:12.280 --> 01:44:13.480
If your core is stiff.

3681
01:44:13.510 --> 01:44:16.600
It seems like the more back flexibility that you have,

3682
01:44:16.601 --> 01:44:19.750
the more you can execute things with less resistance.

3683
01:44:20.270 --> 01:44:20.720
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

3684
01:44:20.720 --> 01:44:21.440
I think it's,

3685
01:44:21.440 --> 01:44:22.010
he's,

3686
01:44:22.010 --> 01:44:23.660
he's all about having that,

3687
01:44:23.780 --> 01:44:25.690
it's like a natural weight belt around.

3688
01:44:25.691 --> 01:44:26.180
Yeah.

3689
01:44:26.180 --> 01:44:26.661
<v 2>Your hips.</v>

3690
01:44:26.661 --> 01:44:28.880
And what sport does he engage in?

3691
01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:29.361
Well,

3692
01:44:29.361 --> 01:44:30.100
I think he,

3693
01:44:30.100 --> 01:44:30.950
he has worked,

3694
01:44:30.951 --> 01:44:33.260
he did say he has worked with some mixed martial artists.

3695
01:44:33.330 --> 01:44:34.163
Hmm.

3696
01:44:34.430 --> 01:44:36.930
I wonder what would happen if he worked with a mixed martial artist that was

3697
01:44:36.931 --> 01:44:40.100
like kicking specialists like a Machida or an Anderson silver or something like

3698
01:44:40.101 --> 01:44:40.371
that.

3699
01:44:40.371 --> 01:44:43.640
Like wonder if they would change their tune if they saw like how much

3700
01:44:43.641 --> 01:44:47.810
flexibility is necessary to pull off certain things like we'll kicks,

3701
01:44:47.960 --> 01:44:48.171
right.

3702
01:44:48.171 --> 01:44:48.351
You know,

3703
01:44:48.351 --> 01:44:51.980
things along those lines where your whole body's like moving in a very flow.

3704
01:44:52.010 --> 01:44:54.960
Anything that where you're resisting and it just like tension and,

3705
01:44:54.990 --> 01:44:55.610
yeah.

3706
01:44:55.610 --> 01:44:56.220
Well

3707
01:44:56.220 --> 01:44:57.053
<v 1>there is,</v>

3708
01:44:57.540 --> 01:44:58.373
um,

3709
01:44:58.560 --> 01:45:02.400
I guess maybe he's advocating not excessive flexibility in the trunk.

3710
01:45:03.150 --> 01:45:06.300
Like he's bigger on having this nice core control.

3711
01:45:06.870 --> 01:45:07.420
Uh,

3712
01:45:07.420 --> 01:45:08.980
<v 2>but I don't think they're mutually exclusive.</v>

3713
01:45:09.160 --> 01:45:09.760
I don't think so.

3714
01:45:09.760 --> 01:45:12.700
Can you have like a strong core and still a flexible?

3715
01:45:13.030 --> 01:45:13.863
<v 1>I think so.</v>

3716
01:45:14.020 --> 01:45:14.410
Yeah.

3717
01:45:14.410 --> 01:45:14.870
I think,

3718
01:45:14.870 --> 01:45:15.703
uh,

3719
01:45:16.050 --> 01:45:16.810
uh,

3720
01:45:16.810 --> 01:45:19.690
he just doesn't like excessive stretching.

3721
01:45:20.120 --> 01:45:23.490
<v 2>It seems to me that there's different requirements at different sports have like</v>

3722
01:45:23.491 --> 01:45:23.641
what,

3723
01:45:23.641 --> 01:45:26.650
what you would need to be a very good shot putter.

3724
01:45:26.780 --> 01:45:31.780
You need a completely different set of physiological skills or strengths to be,

3725
01:45:32.221 --> 01:45:32.611
you know,

3726
01:45:32.611 --> 01:45:34.740
a Jujitsu player or you know,

3727
01:45:34.741 --> 01:45:36.960
a judo person or a karate master,

3728
01:45:36.961 --> 01:45:37.830
whatever the fuck it is.

3729
01:45:38.220 --> 01:45:38.770
It's like,

3730
01:45:38.770 --> 01:45:39.450
it's,

3731
01:45:39.450 --> 01:45:43.830
it's almost like the people who are training you have to be skilled in those

3732
01:45:43.831 --> 01:45:44.664
areas.

3733
01:45:44.730 --> 01:45:45.001
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

3734
01:45:45.001 --> 01:45:45.510
I agree.

3735
01:45:45.510 --> 01:45:46.290
And uh,

3736
01:45:46.290 --> 01:45:46.960
like I,

3737
01:45:46.960 --> 01:45:50.670
I don't think anyone doing sort of bodywork and soft tissue work,

3738
01:45:50.671 --> 01:45:54.720
I think they should all have some sort of foundation in some type of weight

3739
01:45:54.721 --> 01:45:58.440
training or some type of exercise where they're going through those same

3740
01:45:58.441 --> 01:45:59.580
processes themselves.

3741
01:45:59.581 --> 01:46:03.090
Because then I think it gives you a really nice and neat and understanding of

3742
01:46:03.091 --> 01:46:03.871
what you're dealing with.

3743
01:46:03.871 --> 01:46:05.790
When you get a person on your table,

3744
01:46:05.791 --> 01:46:06.150
you're like,

3745
01:46:06.150 --> 01:46:06.271
oh,

3746
01:46:06.271 --> 01:46:07.230
I can relate to that.

3747
01:46:07.231 --> 01:46:07.860
You know?

3748
01:46:07.860 --> 01:46:09.870
<v 2>Do you do sports specific DVDs?</v>

3749
01:46:09.871 --> 01:46:10.111
I mean,

3750
01:46:10.111 --> 01:46:10.720
I know you're do,

3751
01:46:10.720 --> 01:46:12.570
you've done how many DVDs so far?

3752
01:46:12.571 --> 01:46:13.160
Just those two.

3753
01:46:13.160 --> 01:46:15.030
The two extreme kettlebell workouts,

3754
01:46:15.390 --> 01:46:16.380
which are my favorite dude,

3755
01:46:16.440 --> 01:46:17.273
they're awesome things.

3756
01:46:17.310 --> 01:46:19.770
They really are my favorite because you're in fucking shape.

3757
01:46:20.100 --> 01:46:20.611
I mean,

3758
01:46:20.611 --> 01:46:21.021
you,

3759
01:46:21.021 --> 01:46:21.391
you,

3760
01:46:21.391 --> 01:46:23.490
you do it along with everybody.

3761
01:46:23.491 --> 01:46:24.720
Like there's no faking that.

3762
01:46:24.990 --> 01:46:27.360
And the intensity is absolutely real.

3763
01:46:27.870 --> 01:46:28.051
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

3764
01:46:28.051 --> 01:46:28.381
You know,

3765
01:46:28.381 --> 01:46:29.280
the first video,

3766
01:46:29.281 --> 01:46:30.360
it's an interesting story,

3767
01:46:30.361 --> 01:46:30.690
but,

3768
01:46:30.690 --> 01:46:31.523
uh,

3769
01:46:31.580 --> 01:46:31.860
I'm,

3770
01:46:31.860 --> 01:46:34.290
I'm a bit of a procrastinator and,

3771
01:46:34.291 --> 01:46:35.124
uh,

3772
01:46:35.280 --> 01:46:39.510
so we were in Mexico when we filmed that one and we actually,

3773
01:46:39.511 --> 01:46:40.320
uh,

3774
01:46:40.320 --> 01:46:44.910
I had to walk forever to find a part of the beach or there's not a ton of people

3775
01:46:44.911 --> 01:46:45.744
around.

3776
01:46:45.810 --> 01:46:47.850
And so I had my backpack on.

3777
01:46:47.851 --> 01:46:52.851
And you just to get the Kettlebell to Mexico was a hard yeah,

3778
01:46:53.030 --> 01:46:53.340
right.

3779
01:46:53.340 --> 01:46:53.731
It's like,

3780
01:46:53.731 --> 01:46:55.200
what is this thing you want to take this,

3781
01:46:55.201 --> 01:46:55.381
you know,

3782
01:46:55.381 --> 01:46:58.590
and it was fortunate it was 20 kilograms and that's what they kind of allowed on

3783
01:46:58.591 --> 01:47:00.540
the plane was that 45 pounds,

3784
01:47:00.541 --> 01:47:01.374
44 pounds,

3785
01:47:01.690 --> 01:47:02.730
84 or something like that.

3786
01:47:03.420 --> 01:47:04.051
And so,

3787
01:47:04.051 --> 01:47:04.500
uh,

3788
01:47:04.500 --> 01:47:05.550
I had my backpack,

3789
01:47:05.551 --> 01:47:08.280
so I just logged my backpacking into the fragile luggage,

3790
01:47:08.790 --> 01:47:11.250
but we walked down to the end of this beach and,

3791
01:47:11.251 --> 01:47:11.600
um,

3792
01:47:11.600 --> 01:47:14.910
the wife and kids and me and my wife was the camera person.

3793
01:47:15.780 --> 01:47:16.660
And I found this,

3794
01:47:17.240 --> 01:47:18.720
I walked as far as I could,

3795
01:47:19.190 --> 01:47:19.560
uh,

3796
01:47:19.560 --> 01:47:22.980
until there was like this big black reef and all these rocks and everything.

3797
01:47:23.520 --> 01:47:24.061
And,

3798
01:47:24.061 --> 01:47:24.450
uh,

3799
01:47:24.450 --> 01:47:24.780
I'm like,

3800
01:47:24.780 --> 01:47:26.460
well this is as far as I can go.

3801
01:47:26.461 --> 01:47:29.850
And so you'd see the odd person walking down to the end then walking back.

3802
01:47:29.851 --> 01:47:32.880
But you couldn't be too close to the ocean because the waves are so loud.

3803
01:47:33.660 --> 01:47:37.980
And so we found this big rock that my wife kind of hide behind with a camcorder

3804
01:47:38.520 --> 01:47:39.480
cause the wind is,

3805
01:47:39.481 --> 01:47:40.000
uh,

3806
01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:40.320
it's,

3807
01:47:40.320 --> 01:47:41.070
it was windy.

3808
01:47:41.070 --> 01:47:43.200
And so the day,

3809
01:47:43.290 --> 01:47:45.330
two days before we left to go home,

3810
01:47:45.870 --> 01:47:46.350
uh,

3811
01:47:46.350 --> 01:47:46.920
I'm like,

3812
01:47:46.920 --> 01:47:47.670
I've got it.

3813
01:47:47.670 --> 01:47:49.290
Like I've got the masterpiece,

3814
01:47:49.320 --> 01:47:50.670
like all the best ideas.

3815
01:47:50.671 --> 01:47:51.470
And I was like,

3816
01:47:51.470 --> 01:47:52.530
every day I'd be like,

3817
01:47:52.531 --> 01:47:54.270
fine tuning things and trying them out.

3818
01:47:54.750 --> 01:47:55.140
And I'm like,

3819
01:47:55.140 --> 01:47:57.420
I'm ready to do it and I'm going to do it all in one shot.

3820
01:47:57.450 --> 01:47:59.520
Cause I want it to be the real deal.

3821
01:47:59.640 --> 01:48:00.810
Just like a Kettlebell class.

3822
01:48:00.830 --> 01:48:01.230
Right.

3823
01:48:01.230 --> 01:48:02.130
Because I think it's like 50,

3824
01:48:02.131 --> 01:48:03.000
58 minutes.

3825
01:48:03.001 --> 01:48:07.380
And I didn't even time that it was just luck because I've taught so many one

3826
01:48:07.381 --> 01:48:08.520
hour classes in my life,

3827
01:48:08.530 --> 01:48:09.780
but it was just like instinct.

3828
01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:11.340
And uh,

3829
01:48:11.400 --> 01:48:11.811
so yeah,

3830
01:48:11.811 --> 01:48:14.760
in all my favorite workouts are kind of on this first DVD.

3831
01:48:14.761 --> 01:48:15.594
At the time.

3832
01:48:15.930 --> 01:48:17.130
And so we went there,

3833
01:48:17.880 --> 01:48:18.713
filmed it,

3834
01:48:19.130 --> 01:48:19.950
um,

3835
01:48:19.950 --> 01:48:24.060
got back to the place I buried the Kettlebell on the beach cause I thought the

3836
01:48:24.061 --> 01:48:25.110
buried it on the beach.

3837
01:48:25.230 --> 01:48:25.381
Well,

3838
01:48:25.381 --> 01:48:26.910
cause I thought if I have any,

3839
01:48:26.970 --> 01:48:30.750
if there's any problems then I don't have to carry this thing cause I must have

3840
01:48:30.751 --> 01:48:33.870
walked like three miles or something with this thing on my back.

3841
01:48:33.871 --> 01:48:34.704
And it was like,

3842
01:48:34.800 --> 01:48:35.860
and I had to walk through this,

3843
01:48:36.120 --> 01:48:39.120
these different resorts all the way down the beach with my backpack.

3844
01:48:39.120 --> 01:48:42.180
And so you like x marks the spot if you have to come back.

3845
01:48:42.181 --> 01:48:42.640
He goes like,

3846
01:48:42.640 --> 01:48:43.550
go do it again.

3847
01:48:43.590 --> 01:48:43.890
Yeah.

3848
01:48:43.890 --> 01:48:44.723
I found the little,

3849
01:48:44.750 --> 01:48:49.230
made a little notch on the rock and buried this thing like pretty deep.

3850
01:48:49.231 --> 01:48:49.531
I mean,

3851
01:48:49.531 --> 01:48:50.191
I was paranoid.

3852
01:48:50.191 --> 01:48:51.660
I thought someone's going to steal my kettle bell,

3853
01:48:51.661 --> 01:48:53.900
but I don't think it would be stealing,

3854
01:48:54.120 --> 01:48:56.040
finding if that came to your house.

3855
01:48:56.041 --> 01:48:56.874
It'd be stealing.

3856
01:48:57.260 --> 01:48:57.601
You know,

3857
01:48:57.601 --> 01:48:58.434
you can't like leave your,

3858
01:48:58.530 --> 01:48:59.251
but on the beach.

3859
01:48:59.251 --> 01:48:59.451
He goes,

3860
01:48:59.451 --> 01:49:00.290
somebody stole it.

3861
01:49:00.560 --> 01:49:01.393
Oh,

3862
01:49:01.650 --> 01:49:02.401
fucking left it there,

3863
01:49:02.401 --> 01:49:03.210
dude.

3864
01:49:03.210 --> 01:49:04.043
They took it.

3865
01:49:05.430 --> 01:49:05.851
And,

3866
01:49:05.851 --> 01:49:06.390
uh,

3867
01:49:06.390 --> 01:49:07.620
actually when we were in Hawaii,

3868
01:49:07.680 --> 01:49:07.921
we,

3869
01:49:07.921 --> 01:49:08.550
uh,

3870
01:49:08.550 --> 01:49:08.851
we,

3871
01:49:08.851 --> 01:49:09.180
uh,

3872
01:49:09.180 --> 01:49:12.150
I did bury my kettlebell on the beast because I'm too lazy to take it back up to

3873
01:49:12.151 --> 01:49:12.421
the room.

3874
01:49:12.421 --> 01:49:14.070
And there's these guys with the metal,

3875
01:49:14.071 --> 01:49:15.120
the metal detectors.

3876
01:49:15.360 --> 01:49:15.991
There's one guy,

3877
01:49:15.991 --> 01:49:16.740
he's like,

3878
01:49:16.740 --> 01:49:18.150
he always give me a wave.

3879
01:49:18.150 --> 01:49:18.541
He's like,

3880
01:49:18.541 --> 01:49:20.910
cause there were a couple times where he's digging this thing up and I'm like,

3881
01:49:20.940 --> 01:49:21.890
oh that's my kettle bell.

3882
01:49:21.891 --> 01:49:23.010
And he's like,

3883
01:49:23.040 --> 01:49:23.671
oh yeah.

3884
01:49:23.671 --> 01:49:24.330
Okay.

3885
01:49:24.330 --> 01:49:27.780
So you just leave it on the beach buried and then you come back and dig it up

3886
01:49:27.781 --> 01:49:28.830
the next day and work out with it.

3887
01:49:28.831 --> 01:49:29.664
Yeah.

3888
01:49:30.090 --> 01:49:31.020
You're lazy Bro.

3889
01:49:31.050 --> 01:49:31.680
Just carry that.

3890
01:49:31.680 --> 01:49:32.880
I know I got damn room.

3891
01:49:33.080 --> 01:49:34.560
It was wouldn't it be an extra workout?

3892
01:49:34.660 --> 01:49:35.670
Carry it up to your room.

3893
01:49:35.910 --> 01:49:36.743
The farmer's walk.

3894
01:49:36.810 --> 01:49:37.171
Yeah.

3895
01:49:37.171 --> 01:49:37.900
And exceptionalism.

3896
01:49:37.900 --> 01:49:42.180
Apparently the farmer's walk with one weight is far superior than doing it with

3897
01:49:42.181 --> 01:49:42.690
two weights.

3898
01:49:42.690 --> 01:49:43.220
Really?

3899
01:49:43.220 --> 01:49:43.380
Yeah.

3900
01:49:43.380 --> 01:49:44.040
Why is that?

3901
01:49:44.040 --> 01:49:46.050
Cause that co contraction on the opposite side.

3902
01:49:46.490 --> 01:49:47.650
That's what Stuart said.

3903
01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:49.540
<v 3>So when you do the farmer's walk,</v>

3904
01:49:49.541 --> 01:49:53.080
do you do x amount of paces with the right side and then switched to the left?

3905
01:49:53.100 --> 01:49:54.220
I think he was supposed to be that.

3906
01:49:55.230 --> 01:49:58.840
So That's interesting that it's superior if you're holding it on one side.

3907
01:49:58.841 --> 01:50:00.340
I would have thought just the opposite.

3908
01:50:00.790 --> 01:50:01.300
Really?

3909
01:50:01.300 --> 01:50:01.720
Yeah.

3910
01:50:01.720 --> 01:50:05.200
I would've thought it would be superior to have it equally balanced.

3911
01:50:05.290 --> 01:50:06.370
One weight on each side.

3912
01:50:06.790 --> 01:50:09.190
Well it's Kinda like when you go to the gym and you see guys working on their

3913
01:50:09.191 --> 01:50:12.490
obliques and they've got like the heavy dumbbells in each hand.

3914
01:50:12.491 --> 01:50:15.400
It's kind of like this one's pulling you this way and this one's plenty of that

3915
01:50:15.401 --> 01:50:15.521
way.

3916
01:50:15.521 --> 01:50:19.220
And I always say is that as good as just having one and doing it on one side and

3917
01:50:19.221 --> 01:50:20.020
then doing it on the other?

3918
01:50:20.020 --> 01:50:22.570
It's kind of like almost helps pull it over.

3919
01:50:22.570 --> 01:50:24.100
What's your take on two handed windmills?

3920
01:50:24.101 --> 01:50:25.700
Cause that's one of the exercises that I really love.

3921
01:50:25.730 --> 01:50:28.220
I love windmills with a Kettlebell and the chant.

3922
01:50:28.230 --> 01:50:30.490
And then when you drop the Kettlebell down you'd do a curl.

3923
01:50:30.790 --> 01:50:33.700
The kettlebell two hands anyhow,

3924
01:50:34.200 --> 01:50:34.960
is I what they call it?

3925
01:50:34.960 --> 01:50:35.411
Two hands.

3926
01:50:35.411 --> 01:50:36.244
Anyhow,

3927
01:50:36.390 --> 01:50:38.560
some men you remember that?

3928
01:50:38.590 --> 01:50:39.280
No,

3929
01:50:39.280 --> 01:50:39.940
but I like it.

3930
01:50:39.940 --> 01:50:40.960
I like that exercise.

3931
01:50:40.961 --> 01:50:41.740
It's a big one.

3932
01:50:41.740 --> 01:50:42.870
That's an excellent exercise.

3933
01:50:43.210 --> 01:50:47.410
Imagine the amount of force you're putting on the core compared to just one

3934
01:50:47.510 --> 01:50:48.160
kettlebell.

3935
01:50:48.160 --> 01:50:48.341
Well,

3936
01:50:48.341 --> 01:50:49.360
when I hurt my back,

3937
01:50:49.380 --> 01:50:49.570
uh,

3938
01:50:49.570 --> 01:50:53.620
from Jujitsu I really started concentrating more on back exercises and core

3939
01:50:53.621 --> 01:50:57.460
exercise and strengthening exercises because I recognize that there was this

3940
01:50:57.461 --> 01:50:59.260
injury that I was getting in Jujitsu was,

3941
01:50:59.261 --> 01:51:00.970
it was a weak link injury.

3942
01:51:01.030 --> 01:51:04.450
It's like there was a weak link in my chain and the weak link was the core.

3943
01:51:04.480 --> 01:51:05.313
My back,

3944
01:51:05.650 --> 01:51:08.310
I wasn't doing enough curls are not a curls,

3945
01:51:08.340 --> 01:51:09.910
Chin chin-ups rather rose.

3946
01:51:09.940 --> 01:51:13.570
I wasn't doing enough back exercises and I switched by workouts to almost

3947
01:51:13.571 --> 01:51:17.800
primarily that as opposed to a primarily pushing like benching and things along

3948
01:51:17.801 --> 01:51:18.634
those lines.

3949
01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:19.301
Yeah,

3950
01:51:19.301 --> 01:51:20.134
the um,

3951
01:51:20.440 --> 01:51:21.011
the two hands.

3952
01:51:21.011 --> 01:51:21.340
Anyhow,

3953
01:51:21.340 --> 01:51:22.360
that's a creative and you know,

3954
01:51:22.361 --> 01:51:24.910
that's just since we're on the subject of windmills,

3955
01:51:25.270 --> 01:51:29.380
that is one exercise that sometimes I see people going too deep with.

3956
01:51:29.870 --> 01:51:30.100
Like,

3957
01:51:30.100 --> 01:51:30.490
you should,

3958
01:51:30.490 --> 01:51:31.030
shouldn't,

3959
01:51:31.030 --> 01:51:31.480
you should.

3960
01:51:31.480 --> 01:51:34.450
There's that depth where it feels like your hamstrings are going to snap.

3961
01:51:34.810 --> 01:51:36.010
And I think that's where some people,

3962
01:51:36.011 --> 01:51:39.030
they'll take it just a little bit further so that they can touch the floor or

3963
01:51:39.031 --> 01:51:39.940
the ground or whatever.

3964
01:51:40.330 --> 01:51:45.190
If you can make sure that you're aware of where your body's ending up and keep

3965
01:51:45.191 --> 01:51:48.100
that core tight because there's that point where you get to the point where,

3966
01:51:48.110 --> 01:51:48.341
okay,

3967
01:51:48.341 --> 01:51:49.001
my hamstrings,

3968
01:51:49.001 --> 01:51:50.170
that's as far as they're going to go.

3969
01:51:50.650 --> 01:51:52.750
And then there's that little extra.

3970
01:51:53.230 --> 01:51:57.160
If you can stop short of that so that you maintain that nice super stiff core,

3971
01:51:57.161 --> 01:51:58.420
you probably already do that.

3972
01:51:58.421 --> 01:52:01.780
But some people that don't have as much flexibility and I watched myself on the

3973
01:52:01.781 --> 01:52:02.591
video the other day,

3974
01:52:02.591 --> 01:52:06.550
I was doing some homework and I'm going a little deeper than I should on some of

3975
01:52:06.551 --> 01:52:08.680
those windmills just cause I'm trying to look cool.

3976
01:52:08.710 --> 01:52:09.543
But uh,

3977
01:52:09.840 --> 01:52:11.800
for health wise and longevity wise,

3978
01:52:12.520 --> 01:52:15.940
if you can make sure that you maybe even check yourself in a mirror once in a

3979
01:52:15.941 --> 01:52:16.190
while,

3980
01:52:16.190 --> 01:52:17.950
make sure that your back doesn't move at all,

3981
01:52:17.951 --> 01:52:19.690
at the very bottom of that windmill farm.

3982
01:52:20.260 --> 01:52:21.790
Like sort of like how dips,

3983
01:52:21.791 --> 01:52:23.680
you're not supposed to go too low on dips.

3984
01:52:23.980 --> 01:52:24.791
If you go too low,

3985
01:52:24.791 --> 01:52:28.260
you put too much stress on the shoulders and too much stress on the tendon in

3986
01:52:28.270 --> 01:52:29.470
front of that shoulder capsule.

3987
01:52:29.470 --> 01:52:29.681
Hey,

3988
01:52:29.681 --> 01:52:30.460
you're just,

3989
01:52:30.460 --> 01:52:30.761
it's,

3990
01:52:30.761 --> 01:52:31.420
it's,

3991
01:52:31.420 --> 01:52:32.890
it's in a vulnerable position.

3992
01:52:32.891 --> 01:52:33.160
Hey,

3993
01:52:33.160 --> 01:52:36.010
so if you can go down to the point where you feel like if I go any further,

3994
01:52:36.250 --> 01:52:37.990
I'm just resting on my connective tissue.

3995
01:52:38.440 --> 01:52:39.790
If you can stop short of that,

3996
01:52:39.791 --> 01:52:41.740
you'll keep that tension on the muscles and it's,

3997
01:52:42.250 --> 01:52:45.100
but then there's an argument that your body should be able to do that.

3998
01:52:45.200 --> 01:52:47.180
Want to put your body into that stressful position,

3999
01:52:47.181 --> 01:52:48.920
make those connective tissue stronger.

4000
01:52:48.921 --> 01:52:50.900
So sort of like a low squat,

4001
01:52:50.901 --> 01:52:52.940
like dropping your body all the way down to here.

4002
01:52:53.150 --> 01:52:55.850
So I wouldn't say never do windmills nice and deep,

4003
01:52:56.180 --> 01:52:57.740
but if you're doing a lot of windmills,

4004
01:52:58.160 --> 01:52:59.060
be aware of,

4005
01:52:59.100 --> 01:52:59.933
uh,

4006
01:52:59.990 --> 01:53:02.540
how much of your back you're using at the very bottom portion.

4007
01:53:03.050 --> 01:53:03.651
But mind you,

4008
01:53:03.651 --> 01:53:04.221
that's a good thing.

4009
01:53:04.221 --> 01:53:04.761
With kettle bells,

4010
01:53:04.761 --> 01:53:05.510
you're usually,

4011
01:53:05.510 --> 01:53:08.240
most people aren't using so much weight that they have to worry about that.

4012
01:53:08.360 --> 01:53:12.380
Like even someone that's really advanced usually like they're not using much

4013
01:53:12.381 --> 01:53:14.840
more than 40 pounds or something like that for windmills.

4014
01:53:15.140 --> 01:53:15.381
Well,

4015
01:53:15.381 --> 01:53:16.700
I mean for part of the video,

4016
01:53:16.970 --> 01:53:17.810
like part of like the,

4017
01:53:17.830 --> 01:53:20.000
the extended work for your workouts.

4018
01:53:20.001 --> 01:53:20.540
Yeah.

4019
01:53:20.540 --> 01:53:21.860
Well when I do your workouts,

4020
01:53:21.861 --> 01:53:23.000
I do the windmill with,

4021
01:53:23.030 --> 01:53:25.130
I usually do 35 pounds or 45 pounds,

4022
01:53:25.131 --> 01:53:27.130
but when I do windmills just as a standalone,

4023
01:53:27.230 --> 01:53:28.063
I do seventies.

4024
01:53:28.070 --> 01:53:28.700
Yeah.

4025
01:53:28.700 --> 01:53:29.830
So it's just think it's,

4026
01:53:29.831 --> 01:53:33.050
it's a really great exercise for shoulder stability as well.

4027
01:53:33.140 --> 01:53:33.770
Yeah.

4028
01:53:33.770 --> 01:53:34.310
What about,

4029
01:53:34.310 --> 01:53:34.580
uh,

4030
01:53:34.580 --> 01:53:35.121
with getup?

4031
01:53:35.121 --> 01:53:37.510
Steagall pretty heavy on those two get ups upset.

4032
01:53:37.530 --> 01:53:38.331
17 you can't.

4033
01:53:38.331 --> 01:53:41.570
And it's such a neat exercise cause he can go super heavy and just,

4034
01:53:41.571 --> 01:53:42.404
uh,

4035
01:53:42.940 --> 01:53:43.370
yeah,

4036
01:53:43.370 --> 01:53:44.203
rarely give her on that.

4037
01:53:44.210 --> 01:53:44.370
Well,

4038
01:53:44.370 --> 01:53:47.870
it seems to me like a really good stability exercise.

4039
01:53:47.871 --> 01:53:51.080
Like as far as like your ability to maintain your stance,

4040
01:53:51.290 --> 01:53:51.831
maintain,

4041
01:53:51.831 --> 01:53:53.870
you're like pushing on things,

4042
01:53:53.871 --> 01:53:54.890
holding your ground.

4043
01:53:54.890 --> 01:53:55.041
I mean,

4044
01:53:55.041 --> 01:53:55.251
you're,

4045
01:53:55.251 --> 01:53:57.200
you're doing such a weird exercise,

4046
01:53:57.201 --> 01:53:59.840
just stand like that and it's so control based,

4047
01:53:59.841 --> 01:54:00.980
like dropping down,

4048
01:54:01.220 --> 01:54:02.180
laying flat,

4049
01:54:02.390 --> 01:54:03.680
holding the kettle bell up,

4050
01:54:03.681 --> 01:54:04.940
pressing it all over again.

4051
01:54:05.100 --> 01:54:05.250
Yeah.

4052
01:54:05.250 --> 01:54:06.320
That's a very good,

4053
01:54:06.321 --> 01:54:07.310
slow,

4054
01:54:07.340 --> 01:54:08.930
controlled exercise.

4055
01:54:08.931 --> 01:54:10.610
Keeps everything solid.

4056
01:54:10.910 --> 01:54:11.181
Yeah.

4057
01:54:11.181 --> 01:54:11.420
It's,

4058
01:54:11.420 --> 01:54:12.253
I love that one.

4059
01:54:12.830 --> 01:54:13.400
Um,

4060
01:54:13.400 --> 01:54:14.233
so anyway,

4061
01:54:15.110 --> 01:54:18.650
I looked at the video that we had taken that day and,

4062
01:54:18.651 --> 01:54:19.160
uh,

4063
01:54:19.160 --> 01:54:20.480
my wife is so honest.

4064
01:54:20.481 --> 01:54:21.020
I love it,

4065
01:54:21.020 --> 01:54:21.740
not about her.

4066
01:54:21.740 --> 01:54:23.150
And she looked at it and she's like,

4067
01:54:23.450 --> 01:54:24.980
you're doing it way too fast.

4068
01:54:25.370 --> 01:54:27.110
People aren't going to be able to keep up to this.

4069
01:54:27.800 --> 01:54:28.221
And,

4070
01:54:28.221 --> 01:54:28.760
uh,

4071
01:54:28.760 --> 01:54:29.120
I'm like,

4072
01:54:29.120 --> 01:54:29.480
oh,

4073
01:54:29.480 --> 01:54:30.980
and I did not want to do this again.

4074
01:54:30.981 --> 01:54:31.190
Right.

4075
01:54:31.190 --> 01:54:34.280
And of course I left it til the last day and I'm like,

4076
01:54:34.281 --> 01:54:34.401
Oh,

4077
01:54:34.401 --> 01:54:35.390
let me take a look at that.

4078
01:54:35.391 --> 01:54:35.990
And so I'm like,

4079
01:54:35.990 --> 01:54:36.641
Oh God,

4080
01:54:36.641 --> 01:54:37.050
that,

4081
01:54:37.050 --> 01:54:38.120
that is fast.

4082
01:54:38.121 --> 01:54:39.630
I'm just trying to get this over with Alex.

4083
01:54:39.650 --> 01:54:41.900
Terrible and fast.

4084
01:54:41.900 --> 01:54:42.960
Like too,

4085
01:54:43.010 --> 01:54:43.701
too fast.

4086
01:54:43.701 --> 01:54:46.130
Like an ineffective workout or too hard to do,

4087
01:54:46.400 --> 01:54:48.110
I think for a lot of people.

4088
01:54:49.070 --> 01:54:53.420
Maybe a little bit too little bit too little time between reputations.

4089
01:54:53.421 --> 01:54:53.601
Yeah.

4090
01:54:53.601 --> 01:54:56.350
A little bit too fast and uh,

4091
01:54:56.390 --> 01:54:59.450
but shouldn't this by aspire to be able to do it the way you're doing it?

4092
01:55:00.620 --> 01:55:01.370
Yeah.

4093
01:55:01.370 --> 01:55:04.460
Have you ever thought about doing like an advanced version for fucking people

4094
01:55:04.461 --> 01:55:05.294
like me?

4095
01:55:05.640 --> 01:55:06.473
[inaudible] well,

4096
01:55:06.690 --> 01:55:07.820
that's where the double Kettlebell,

4097
01:55:07.821 --> 01:55:08.690
when it's going to come up with,

4098
01:55:08.860 --> 01:55:09.690
you're going to love that.

4099
01:55:09.690 --> 01:55:10.523
Okay,

4100
01:55:10.890 --> 01:55:13.970
I'm not gonna eat my words.

4101
01:55:15.380 --> 01:55:16.010
Um,

4102
01:55:16.010 --> 01:55:20.780
and then I put it on the TV with the little cables and the wind noise was

4103
01:55:20.781 --> 01:55:21.501
insane.

4104
01:55:21.501 --> 01:55:23.330
It was like he couldn't hear a thing,

4105
01:55:23.390 --> 01:55:24.290
so he had to do it again.

4106
01:55:24.560 --> 01:55:25.190
Oh yeah.

4107
01:55:25.190 --> 01:55:25.550
I'm like,

4108
01:55:25.550 --> 01:55:26.271
Oh God,

4109
01:55:26.271 --> 01:55:27.590
we've got to go back there tomorrow.

4110
01:55:27.610 --> 01:55:30.590
I don't not only have to do one or two chapters over again,

4111
01:55:30.920 --> 01:55:32.450
I have to do the whole thing over again.

4112
01:55:32.451 --> 01:55:36.380
And I had like wicked a sand rash on my wrists,

4113
01:55:36.480 --> 01:55:38.360
like kettles hitting your rest,

4114
01:55:38.710 --> 01:55:39.140
you know,

4115
01:55:39.140 --> 01:55:41.540
my hands were pretty toughened up so they were okay.

4116
01:55:41.541 --> 01:55:42.950
But I'm just like,

4117
01:55:43.220 --> 01:55:43.921
Oh man,

4118
01:55:43.921 --> 01:55:44.070
this

4119
01:55:44.070 --> 01:55:44.790
<v 1>is going to,</v>

4120
01:55:44.790 --> 01:55:49.470
so that's why there's certain times during that video where I look like I'm

4121
01:55:49.471 --> 01:55:50.070
going to die.

4122
01:55:50.070 --> 01:55:50.761
I am like,

4123
01:55:50.761 --> 01:55:51.140
