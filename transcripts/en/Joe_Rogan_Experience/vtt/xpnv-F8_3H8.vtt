<v Speaker 1>They're sent there.</v>

16
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.480
<v Speaker 1>They were sensitive about it,</v>

17
00:00:26.481 --> 00:00:28.430
<v Speaker 1>but it's festival people though,</v>

82
00:01:44.991 --> 00:01:48.560
<v Speaker 1>some thoughts and boost of inspiration after I've laid down,</v>

83
00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.513
<v Speaker 1>I'll lay down.</v>

84
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:50.700
<v Speaker 1>So I'm thinking about something.</v>

85
00:01:50.701 --> 00:01:51.411
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't going to sleep.</v>

86
00:01:51.411 --> 00:01:51.801
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

87
00:01:51.801 --> 00:01:52.340
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit.</v>

88
00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.260
<v Speaker 1>And I get up and start writing.</v>

89
00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:55.620
<v Speaker 1>I made myself get up to,</v>

90
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.261
<v Speaker 1>or I have a,</v>

91
00:01:57.261 --> 00:01:57.531
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

92
00:01:57.531 --> 00:02:00.050
<v Speaker 1>I keep my phone right by the bed alarms on my phone.</v>

93
00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.140
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

94
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.251
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

95
00:02:00.251 --> 00:02:01.610
<v Speaker 1>And I have the little voice notes.</v>

96
00:02:01.611 --> 00:02:03.680
<v Speaker 1>I'll just make a little voice note of it.</v>

97
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:03.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

98
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:04.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

99
00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:04.640
<v Speaker 1>That's a good,</v>

100
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.451
<v Speaker 1>that's a good way to do it.</v>

101
00:02:05.451 --> 00:02:06.284
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>

102
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.700
<v Speaker 1>I started using the voice note thing.</v>

103
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.940
<v Speaker 1>I was a little crazy to fantasy wine tasting thing,</v>

104
00:02:13.941 --> 00:02:14.241
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

105
00:02:14.241 --> 00:02:15.000
<v Speaker 1>Tell him stuff.</v>

106
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.540
<v Speaker 2>It was great.</v>

107
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.490
<v Speaker 2>A lot of wine tastings,</v>

108
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.310
<v Speaker 2>romantic,</v>

109
00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.001
<v Speaker 2>romantic.</v>

110
00:02:18.001 --> 00:02:21.000
<v Speaker 2>But the only weird thing is like the whole city is based on wine.</v>

111
00:02:21.001 --> 00:02:23.580
<v Speaker 2>So everyone's ever getting wasted and drunk and it's all couples.</v>

112
00:02:23.581 --> 00:02:25.260
<v Speaker 2>But at 10 o'clock it's a ghost town.</v>

113
00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.423
<v Speaker 2>So we want,</v>

114
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.600
<v Speaker 2>would you want swingers clubs?</v>

115
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:28.501
<v Speaker 2>I thought there'd be like,</v>

116
00:02:28.501 --> 00:02:28.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

117
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:29.910
<v Speaker 2>people hanging out on the street.</v>

118
00:02:29.911 --> 00:02:30.151
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

119
00:02:30.151 --> 00:02:31.230
<v Speaker 2>not one car.</v>

120
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.130
<v Speaker 2>Not One person.</v>

121
00:02:32.131 --> 00:02:33.000
<v Speaker 2>Every hotel though.</v>

122
00:02:33.001 --> 00:02:33.630
<v Speaker 2>No vacancy.</v>

123
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:34.463
<v Speaker 2>No vacancy.</v>

124
00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.000
<v Speaker 2>So it was packed with people,</v>

125
00:02:36.001 --> 00:02:38.190
<v Speaker 2>but everyone's just passed out by eight o'clock.</v>

126
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.670
<v Speaker 2>So what part of the country was his Sylvain California.</v>

127
00:02:41.671 --> 00:02:42.504
<v Speaker 2>It's a north.</v>

128
00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.010
<v Speaker 2>About 40 minutes north of Santa Barbara and ate mushrooms instead.</v>

129
00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:48.570
<v Speaker 2>We ate mushrooms.</v>

130
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

131
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.760
<v Speaker 2>And did you learn anything while you're eating mushrooms?</v>

132
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:51.683
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

133
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.210
<v Speaker 2>antique hotels are very scary.</v>

134
00:02:54.211 --> 00:02:55.044
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure.</v>

135
00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.420
<v Speaker 2>It just feels scary.</v>

136
00:02:57.421 --> 00:02:59.820
<v Speaker 2>Spooky like old wallpaper and old like</v>

137
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.120
<v Speaker 1>stuff everywhere.</v>

138
00:03:01.121 --> 00:03:02.350
<v Speaker 1>It's just memories in that stuff.</v>

139
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

140
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.800
<v Speaker 1>This guy named Rupert Sheldrake and thinks that there's memory and everything.</v>

141
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.380
<v Speaker 1>It seemed like that in your own town,</v>

142
00:03:08.381 --> 00:03:08.830
<v Speaker 1>Brian.</v>

143
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:09.663
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

144
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.391
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

145
00:03:10.391 --> 00:03:14.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean I love Joe because Joe just like me stoned.</v>

146
00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.640
<v Speaker 1>Really think about it like it's like me if I ate a handful of mushrooms,</v>

147
00:03:18.641 --> 00:03:19.474
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

148
00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:20.460
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

149
00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:21.293
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

150
00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:22.463

<v Speaker 1>the crappiest thing that staff needs to do that.</v>

197
00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:42.570
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

198
00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.120
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that sometimes you will sabotage your life just to create more</v>

199
00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:45.700
<v Speaker 1>material?</v>

200

<v Speaker 1>Not Possible.</v>

201
00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:47.371

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

203
00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.620
<v Speaker 1>I think it helps because nobody,</v>

204
00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:50.730
<v Speaker 1>nobody wants to hear comic.</v>

205
00:04:50.731 --> 00:04:51.660
<v Speaker 1>When he got on stage going,</v>

206
00:04:51.661 --> 00:04:52.410
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

208
00:04:54.481 --> 00:04:54.781
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

209
00:04:54.781 --> 00:04:55.560
<v Speaker 1>I have a lot of money.</v>

210
00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.530
<v Speaker 1>Boy Am I in shape.</v>

211
00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.690
<v Speaker 1>I went to vacation with my wife,</v>

212
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:01.553
<v Speaker 1>everything was awesome.</v>

213
00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.510
<v Speaker 1>That's a boring show.</v>

214
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.720
<v Speaker 1>So you have to be every year that's conflict and paste that on top of top of the</v>

215
00:05:09.721 --> 00:05:11.790
<v Speaker 1>actual conflict and painted life would normally give.</v>

216
00:05:11.791 --> 00:05:14.850
<v Speaker 1>Do you think you create some just for material or did you take that you just so</v>

217
00:05:14.851 --> 00:05:18.980
<v Speaker 1>happened to be lucky in that you're blessed with a fucked up chaotic life that</v>

218
00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:20.160
<v Speaker 1>lends itself to a good comment.</v>

219
00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:24.920
<v Speaker 1>I say that you probably create more than anything you create more than any</v>

220
00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.950
<v Speaker 1>therapy world is exactly how you want it to be.</v>

221
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.610
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

222
00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:33.443
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

223
00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.720
<v Speaker 1>This is like the secret we're giving you like two minutes.</v>

224
00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.720
<v Speaker 1>We explain the power of positive thinking,</v>

225
00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.040
<v Speaker 1>the law of attraction.</v>

226
00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:42.433
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

227
00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:55.723
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

228
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:03.370
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>
