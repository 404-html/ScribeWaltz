00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.180
<v Speaker 1>They've got more people in their state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then we have in our entire country,</v>

20
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.770
<v Speaker 1>there's more people in the greater la</v>

72
00:03:12.851 --> 00:03:14.410
<v Speaker 2>feminist.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You gotta be careful with these fucking</v>

78
00:03:24.611 --> 00:03:29.560
<v Speaker 2>male feminists that is just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is a sneaky ploy to get pussy.</v>

79
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.840
<v Speaker 2>What was that one?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who Was it?</v>

80
00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.010
<v Speaker 2>Was it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

81
00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:38.070
<v Speaker 2>Eric Weinstein that was telling us about</v>
<v Speaker 2>a particular type of cuddle fish that</v>

82
00:03:39.101 --> 00:03:44.101
<v Speaker 2>pretends to be a female so he can get in</v>
<v Speaker 2>close with the males because the males</v>

83
00:03:44.921 --> 00:03:49.150
<v Speaker 2>don't recognize him as being a threat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was it?</v>

84
00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.750
<v Speaker 2>Sneaky sneaker male.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a sneaker male.</v>

85
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.250
<v Speaker 2>Hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Operate like underneath the large cuddle</v>

86
00:03:57.251 --> 00:04:01.270
<v Speaker 2>fish and with all the females and bangs</v>
<v Speaker 2>on me getting on the sneak tip.</v>

87

90
00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.880

91
00:04:09.881 --> 00:04:14.590
<v Speaker 2>cuddle fish tends to be a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but really it's just trying to get some</v>

92
00:04:14.591 --> 00:04:15.371
<v Speaker 2>pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

93
00:04:15.371 --> 00:04:18.010
<v Speaker 2>And it hit strategy is not to be the</v>
<v Speaker 2>big,</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's like it's the Weinstein of it all</v>

123
00:05:42.461 --> 00:05:43.750
<v Speaker 2>and then it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

124
00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.150
<v Speaker 2>an hour of it all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what Matt did.</v>

<v Speaker 2>angle where he doesn't even touch it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>because you think about it like who?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like who would put everything in peril</v>

131
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.740
<v Speaker 2>to just circle off in front of someone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you know this is going to come back</v>

<v Speaker 2>I think it's one of the things that like</v>

136
00:06:18.291 --> 00:06:21.530
<v Speaker 2>makes people funny too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that ridiculous way of viewing the</v>

144
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.580
<v Speaker 2>and if I didn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might've worked for somebody.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Like I know dudes that people tried to</v>

147
00:06:43.461 --> 00:06:44.870
<v Speaker 2>get me to do that in college.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were like,</v>

148
00:06:44.871 --> 00:06:46.140
<v Speaker 2>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should just pull your dick out.</v>

149
00:06:46.141 --> 00:06:47.150
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

150
00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:48.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

151
00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:52.880
<v Speaker 2>I never had the courage to just pull my</v>
<v Speaker 2>dick out in front of a girl.</v>

152
00:06:52.881 --> 00:06:55.100
<v Speaker 2>But I know cats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing it all the time.</v>

153
00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.280
<v Speaker 2>But when it does work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Holy Shit,</v>

154
00:06:58.281 --> 00:07:01.520
<v Speaker 2>I got to figure out what the rhythm is.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

157
00:07:07.971 --> 00:07:09.140
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

158
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:11.900
<v Speaker 2>how's that possible?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then other times where you would</v>

159
00:07:11.901 --> 00:07:13.710
<v Speaker 2>pull your dick out and grow and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

160
00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what did I do?</v>

161
00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:19.970
<v Speaker 2>If you're Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't bat baseball averages,</v>

162
00:07:19.971 --> 00:07:22.880
<v Speaker 2>which a nick polo game because he died,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a low acid,</v>

163
00:07:22.881 --> 00:07:26.270
<v Speaker 2>low average,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a low average and now come back and</v>

164
00:07:26.271 --> 00:07:31.271
<v Speaker 2>hit that one out of a hundred</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was worth it until the day man,</v>

165
00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:39.180
<v Speaker 2>the off 99 are coming out and if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have like a freak girlfriend,</v>

166
00:07:39.711 --> 00:07:40.820
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when you're in high school or</v>

167
00:07:40.821 --> 00:07:43.030
<v Speaker 2>something like that and then just ruins</v>
<v Speaker 2>your perception.</v>

168
00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:45.470
<v Speaker 2>You know what else fucks it not to do is</v>
<v Speaker 2>up the Strip club.</v>

169
00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:49.160
<v Speaker 2>They hang out there so they have this</v>
<v Speaker 2>false reality of what you know,</v>

170
00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:50.330
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>woman is this.</v>

171
00:07:50.331 --> 00:07:53.030
<v Speaker 2>And then when they go out and just try</v>
<v Speaker 2>to talk to a regular woman and like,</v>

172
00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.590
<v Speaker 2>well you got to get to know me first.</v>

00:07:54.591 --> 00:07:57.200
<v Speaker 2>fuck you bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't even know how to do that.</v>

174
00:07:57.201 --> 00:07:59.000
<v Speaker 2>But it was also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just getting used to dealing with</v>

175
00:07:59.001 --> 00:08:01.820
<v Speaker 2>freaks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're dealing with freaks all the time.</v>

176
00:08:01.821 --> 00:08:03.680
<v Speaker 2>They have a different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different parameters.</v>

177
00:08:03.681 --> 00:08:07.490
<v Speaker 2>Not like the lady in the office that</v>
<v Speaker 2>handles accounting and I take out on</v>

178
00:08:07.491 --> 00:08:08.324

<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

179
00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:13.640
<v Speaker 2>but that is nice when you meet a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you has agency over her body and knows</v>

180
00:08:13.641 --> 00:08:15.690
<v Speaker 2>what she likes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That could fuck you up when you go and</v>

181
00:08:15.691 --> 00:08:17.660
<v Speaker 2>you dating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dealing with somebody that's not that</v>

182
00:08:17.661 --> 00:08:18.310
<v Speaker 2>free.</v>

183
00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:19.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

184
00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:22.030
<v Speaker 2>That could be a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a problem where we're girls just,</v>

185
00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:24.740
<v Speaker 2>they're not freeze the right word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

186
00:08:24.741 --> 00:08:28.250
<v Speaker 2>They're not relaxed enough or</v>
<v Speaker 2>comfortable enough in their own skin or</v>

187
00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:30.440
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Know what they like and just can tell</v>

<v Speaker 2>you already liker,</v>

191
00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:39.460

<v Speaker 2>and with also what women do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We tried to change the person we're with</v>

262
00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:21.150
<v Speaker 2>I had a buddy of mine who would get</v>
<v Speaker 2>girls and get them to go on a diet.</v>

263
00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:24.480
<v Speaker 2>He would date cute girls that were like</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little chubby and then take it to the</v>

264
00:11:24.481 --> 00:11:25.920
<v Speaker 2>gym,</v>
<v Speaker 2>added value.</v>

<v Speaker 2>what are you doing?</v>

266
00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:28.891
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

<v Speaker 2>this way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they really like you.</v>

268
00:11:30.361 --> 00:11:32.000
<v Speaker 2>You get them and then you can make them</v>
<v Speaker 2>hot and,</v>

269
00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:35.400
<v Speaker 2>but that's a lot of work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's chaos.</v>

270
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:37.140

<v Speaker 2>I mean it might work,</v>

271

<v Speaker 2>freak.</v>

277

<v Speaker 2>But in a couple of nights I've been</v>

315
00:13:07.211 --> 00:13:09.940
<v Speaker 2>fucking good and discipline or after a</v>
<v Speaker 2>certain time,</v>

316
00:13:09.941 --> 00:13:12.700
<v Speaker 2>no liquids and their sleep like a baby</v>
<v Speaker 2>all through the night.</v>

317

<v Speaker 2>Wake up at night you did something.</v>

318
00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:19.330
<v Speaker 2>And the other thing I do now is that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>work out in the morning.</v>

319
00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:20.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I've been doing.</v>

320
00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.600
<v Speaker 2>Work out in the morning before I eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I figured it out.</v>

321
00:13:22.601 --> 00:13:24.010
<v Speaker 2>So I think I figured out how I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do it.</v>

322
00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:26.110
<v Speaker 2>How are you going to do it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try to burn.</v>

323
00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:28.240
<v Speaker 2>I started wearing a heart rate monitor</v>
<v Speaker 2>finally.</v>

324
00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:31.270
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I tried to burn a thousand calories</v>

325
00:13:31.271 --> 00:13:33.430
<v Speaker 2>in my workout.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I tried to get to.</v>

326
00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:34.450
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

327
00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:35.440
<v Speaker 2>a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

328
00:13:35.441 --> 00:13:38.080
<v Speaker 2>but if I can get to the thousand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then if I try to,</v>

329
00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:42.910
<v Speaker 2>if I eat 1800 calories that whole day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then that 800 for sure.</v>

330
00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:45.100
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm trying.</v>

331
00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:49.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm one day three day three is do you</v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

332
00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:53.690
<v Speaker 2>do you follow a specific type of diet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you eating specific foods?</v>

333
00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:54.543
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I,</v>

334
00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:59.110
<v Speaker 2>I try to um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be more on the plant base tip,</v>

335
00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:03.160
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a Vegan because I will let them</v>

336
00:14:03.161 --> 00:14:03.760

<v Speaker 2>and I think Vegan is like,</v>

338
00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:09.340
<v Speaker 2>I love what it represents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think their marketing,</v>

339
00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:12.040
<v Speaker 2>that's not the best word people are</v>
<v Speaker 2>running from that term.</v>

340
00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:14.630
<v Speaker 2>So I just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well people run it from comments.</v>

341
00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:16.980
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people that are Vegan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just can't.</v>

346
00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:31.990

<v Speaker 2>But if you say that people got mad at</v>
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>

349
00:14:34.721 --> 00:14:36.880
<v Speaker 2>so he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just say I eat vegan most of the time.</v>

350
00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:38.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's most of the time.</v>

351
00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:40.900
<v Speaker 2>That's what he says.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

352
00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:43.930
<v Speaker 2>But the vegans that are good people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are just doing it because they care and</v>

353
00:14:43.931 --> 00:14:46.180
<v Speaker 2>they're kind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get a bum rap because of all the</v>

354
00:14:46.181 --> 00:14:49.660
<v Speaker 2>psychos and those cycles almost always</v>
<v Speaker 2>have like Vegan in their name.</v>

355
00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:51.990
<v Speaker 2>Like vegan warrior early.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

356
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:54.290
<v Speaker 1>Vegan earth goddess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vegan first.</v>

357
00:14:54.291 --> 00:14:56.150
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's funny if Vegan is last,</v>

358
00:14:56.151 --> 00:14:59.400
<v Speaker 1>they tend to be cooler like this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's,</v>

359
00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:02.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm this person and then Vegan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like my man Epi,</v>

360
00:15:02.211 --> 00:15:03.620
<v Speaker 1>Vegan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he loves your show.</v>

361
00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:07.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do a segment when he comes</v>

362
00:15:07.371 --> 00:15:08.990
<v Speaker 1>to town and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

363
00:15:08.991 --> 00:15:10.490
<v Speaker 1>I like that cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a cool,</v>

364
00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:12.370
<v Speaker 1>I had a lot of vegans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

365
00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:13.400
<v Speaker 1>but I'm mocked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

366
00:15:13.401 --> 00:15:15.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm mocking myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mark myself.</v>

367
00:15:15.411 --> 00:15:18.080
<v Speaker 1>How the fuck am I not going to mock?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My wife isn't Vegan and try to,</v>

368
00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:21.260
<v Speaker 1>but she'll eat stuff that I'm making</v>
<v Speaker 1>some tough.</v>

369
00:15:21.261 --> 00:15:22.011
<v Speaker 1>She'll play kate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Me.</v>

370
00:15:22.011 --> 00:15:24.410
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took a huge loss on Thanksgiving</v>

371
00:15:24.411 --> 00:15:25.700
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made two pies.</v>

372
00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:29.780
<v Speaker 1>I like to cook and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I made to a sweet potato pies,</v>

373
00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:34.460
<v Speaker 1>one with one with milk and butter and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the stuff that you had growing up.</v>

374
00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:37.880
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I did that and then I made one vegan</v>

375
00:15:37.881 --> 00:15:41.600
<v Speaker 1>one just to see what would a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what people would like.</v>

376
00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.330
<v Speaker 1>And Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just one slight sticking out of</v>

377
00:15:44.331 --> 00:15:49.331
<v Speaker 1>the Vegan</v>
<v Speaker 1>was sad slice and everybody was like,</v>

378
00:15:50.901 --> 00:15:51.830
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>

379
00:15:51.831 --> 00:15:53.540
<v Speaker 1>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they tore the other pile.</v>

380
00:15:53.650 --> 00:15:58.650
<v Speaker 1>I of course</v>
<v Speaker 1>had to wrap it up and take it back home</v>

381
00:15:59.161 --> 00:16:00.350
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was still in the fridge.</v>

382
00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:04.340
<v Speaker 1>What's in the Vegan One?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So instead of eggs you make a flax seed</v>

383
00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:05.473
<v Speaker 1>eggs.</v>

384
00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:10.610
<v Speaker 1>So your pod got freckles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that.</v>

385
00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:12.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't want no freckles on my got damp</v>
<v Speaker 1>odd but,</v>

386
00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:14.780
<v Speaker 1>but then it's everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same.</v>

387
00:16:14.781 --> 00:16:16.550
<v Speaker 1>It's the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

388
00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:18.740
<v Speaker 1>and instead of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm using half and half,</v>

389
00:16:18.741 --> 00:16:19.690
<v Speaker 1>you use like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

390
00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:23.210
<v Speaker 1>use a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be like almond milk mixed with like</v>

391
00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:25.310
<v Speaker 1>coconut milk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all right.</v>

392
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:27.410
<v Speaker 1>And then you do a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

393
00:16:27.411 --> 00:16:29.870
<v Speaker 1>but at the same all sugar flour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that's the same.</v>

394
00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:32.420
<v Speaker 1>And no eggs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no eggs,</v>

395
00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:34.760
<v Speaker 1>but eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't taste eggs,</v>

396
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:36.860
<v Speaker 1>eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just exit is a binding agent.</v>

397
00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:40.370
<v Speaker 1>It just holds it together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I was in Hawaii last week,</v>

398
00:16:40.371 --> 00:16:41.820
<v Speaker 1>we made Gnocchi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>

399
00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:45.020
<v Speaker 1>We took a class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a potato pasta.</v>

400
00:16:45.021 --> 00:16:46.400
<v Speaker 1>They were talking about that at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>store.</v>

401
00:16:46.401 --> 00:16:48.350
<v Speaker 1>I've never had that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

403
00:16:49.461 --> 00:16:51.650
<v Speaker 1>it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes good Gnocchi though because</v>

404
00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:53.960
<v Speaker 1>everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's eye contact.</v>

405
00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:54.801
<v Speaker 1>Divert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>

406
00:16:54.801 --> 00:16:55.420
<v Speaker 1>who makes good nobody?</v>

407
00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:56.070
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>when you open the menu and you know,</v>

417
00:17:19.641 --> 00:17:23.660
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know fucking with that like I</v>

418

<v Speaker 1>like lamb chops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then Nokia like suck none of my meals to</v>

419
00:17:32.031 --> 00:17:34.130
<v Speaker 1>track.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably been sitting there my</v>

420
00:17:34.131 --> 00:17:37.260
<v Speaker 1>whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Going to a fancy Italian restaurants and</v>

421
00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:39.560
<v Speaker 1>just never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an interesting pasta because it's a</v>

422
00:17:39.561 --> 00:17:42.230
<v Speaker 1>pasta made with like they make it with</v>
<v Speaker 1>potatoes,</v>

423
00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:47.470
<v Speaker 1>they boiled potatoes and they smash them</v>
<v Speaker 1>down and then they um,</v>

424
00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:49.650
<v Speaker 1>they get it to a certain consistency</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it off.</v>

425
00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:50.020
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

426
00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:52.620
<v Speaker 2>then they add certain amount of flour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we did the whole thing.</v>

427
00:17:52.621 --> 00:17:56.550
<v Speaker 2>We chopped it up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we pressed it into your roll it roll the</v>

428
00:17:56.551 --> 00:17:59.670
<v Speaker 2>flower out until I like a little tube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you cut little sections of it and</v>

429
00:17:59.671 --> 00:18:03.930
<v Speaker 2>you make your Gnocchi with the sections</v>
<v Speaker 2>and do you have to then be baked that or</v>

430
00:18:03.931 --> 00:18:05.300
<v Speaker 2>do you yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they boil it,</v>

431
00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:06.620
<v Speaker 2>boil it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boil.</v>

432
00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:08.430
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't watch them do it and I'm pretty</v>

433
00:18:08.431 --> 00:18:10.930
<v Speaker 2>sure they boil it though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Make it eel sauce and then that's</v>

434
00:18:10.931 --> 00:18:12.440
<v Speaker 2>awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got a bunch of different sauces.</v>

435
00:18:12.441 --> 00:18:14.730
<v Speaker 2>We though the chef cooked it with three</v>
<v Speaker 2>different sauces.</v>

436
00:18:14.731 --> 00:18:17.460
<v Speaker 2>He cooked it with uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Bolognese sauce.</v>

437
00:18:17.461 --> 00:18:19.260
<v Speaker 2>He cooked it with a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

438
00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:22.410
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like a cheese sauce with,</v>

439
00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:24.360
<v Speaker 2>with uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>walnuts,</v>

440
00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:26.430
<v Speaker 2>like a walnut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget what kind of cheese.</v>

441
00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:28.430
<v Speaker 2>And then there was another one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one other sock.</v>

442
00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:30.060
<v Speaker 2>A pesto.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love.</v>

443
00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:31.470
<v Speaker 2>I make fresh cut pesto.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

444
00:18:31.471 --> 00:18:32.500
<v Speaker 2>it was good man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

445
00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:34.050
<v Speaker 2>it's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah man.</v>

446
00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:38.310
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if you just cut out bread and</v>

447
00:18:38.311 --> 00:18:40.290
<v Speaker 2>then cut out pasta,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are the two big ones.</v>

448
00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:41.940
<v Speaker 2>Just cut that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gnocchi.</v>

449
00:18:41.941 --> 00:18:42.810
<v Speaker 2>Pasta dough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

450
00:18:42.811 --> 00:18:45.180
<v Speaker 2>but that's potato pasta.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's different.</v>

451
00:18:45.181 --> 00:18:46.200
<v Speaker 2>It's different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

452
00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:49.350
<v Speaker 2>It's not as good for you as like some</v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

453
00:18:49.351 --> 00:18:52.120
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think it's nearly as bad for</v>
<v Speaker 2>you as grain brain.</v>

454
00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:55.530
<v Speaker 2>I think green is just the terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you gotten through,</v>

455
00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:57.330
<v Speaker 2>I haven't gotten through night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That dude's book,</v>

456
00:18:57.930 --> 00:18:59.430
<v Speaker 2>wheat belly belly?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

457
00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:04.440
<v Speaker 2>I haven't watched the documentary on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>plane coming back from Hawaii about</v>

458
00:19:05.281 --> 00:19:06.780
<v Speaker 2>wheat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me see the fucking name of it is,</v>

459
00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:09.810
<v Speaker 2>but it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a trip and it was all talking</v>

460
00:19:09.811 --> 00:19:13.690
<v Speaker 2>about the roundup chemicals that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>spray on.</v>

461
00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:14.400
<v Speaker 2>There it is.</v>

462
00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:15.810
<v Speaker 2>And they were talking about how people</v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

463
00:19:15.811 --> 00:19:17.310
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it only affects bacteria.</v>

464
00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:18.931
<v Speaker 2>And they were saying,</v>

<v Speaker 2>the name of the documentary and it's,</v>

470
00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:29.580
<v Speaker 2>it's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried watching it.</v>

471
00:19:29.581 --> 00:19:31.590
<v Speaker 2>That dude was talking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just,</v>

472
00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:33.420
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was all right man.</v>

473
00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:36.630
<v Speaker 2>I was falling as droning on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the problem with all those</v>

474
00:19:36.631 --> 00:19:39.510
<v Speaker 2>academics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like to be the type of person that could</v>

475
00:19:39.511 --> 00:19:43.510
<v Speaker 2>sit down and do that kind of research.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Painstaking time consuming research</v>

476
00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.750
<v Speaker 2>boring is five and you need those</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

477
00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:47.910
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those people are the only ones that are</v>

478
00:19:47.911 --> 00:19:48.930
<v Speaker 2>going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to do it.</v>

479
00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:49.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

480
00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:53.550
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need those people tests and then just</v>

481
00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:57.390
<v Speaker 2>explaining to you the dangers of complex</v>
<v Speaker 2>glutens group.</v>

482
00:19:57.660 --> 00:19:58.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

483
00:19:58.350 --> 00:19:58.891
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

484
00:19:58.891 --> 00:20:01.140
<v Speaker 2>that's my goal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'll check back in with you and like</v>

485
00:20:01.141 --> 00:20:04.020
<v Speaker 2>six weeks to see if I'm away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need them three days in feeling strong</v>

486
00:20:04.021 --> 00:20:04.590
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

487
00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:06.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm calm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about it publicly.</v>

488
00:20:06.211 --> 00:20:07.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm usually really private about what</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing.</v>

489
00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:10.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think talking about it publicly is</v>

490
00:20:10.171 --> 00:20:11.400
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey man,</v>

491
00:20:11.401 --> 00:20:12.900
<v Speaker 2>once you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once you get it out there,</v>

492
00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:17.490
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once you get over 40 I feel like,</v>

493
00:20:17.491 --> 00:20:21.000
<v Speaker 2>I feel like you can eat whatever you</v>
<v Speaker 2>want until you're 40 because you only</v>

494
00:20:21.001 --> 00:20:25.500
<v Speaker 2>get one in testing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then you have to start your body</v>

495
00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:28.110
<v Speaker 2>loses enzymes that will break it down as</v>
<v Speaker 2>vigorously.</v>

496
00:20:28.111 --> 00:20:29.490
<v Speaker 2>Cause I have a son now and I watch my</v>
<v Speaker 2>son,</v>

497
00:20:29.491 --> 00:20:32.880
<v Speaker 2>my son eat anything and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his energy is high,</v>

498
00:20:32.881 --> 00:20:33.691
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all of that.</v>

499
00:20:33.691 --> 00:20:36.450
<v Speaker 2>But when you get older you lose some of</v>
<v Speaker 2>those enzymes.</v>

500
00:20:36.451 --> 00:20:38.700
<v Speaker 2>I feel like enzymes are like government</v>
<v Speaker 2>workers.</v>

501
00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:41.070
<v Speaker 2>Like you eat a steak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

502
00:20:41.071 --> 00:20:44.760
<v Speaker 2>who's going to get that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean getting that shit for 40 years.</v>

503
00:20:44.761 --> 00:20:45.571
<v Speaker 2>Anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody else,</v>

504
00:20:45.571 --> 00:20:48.190
<v Speaker 2>we're going to get there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then it sits in the city plus</v>

505
00:20:48.191 --> 00:20:52.240
<v Speaker 2>your sons growing mustaches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fondness for calories,</v>

506
00:20:52.241 --> 00:20:53.290
<v Speaker 2>just turning them off.</v>

507
00:20:56.550 --> 00:20:57.990
<v Speaker 1>He's starting to speak sign language</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

508
00:20:57.991 --> 00:20:59.850
<v Speaker 1>Like just the little things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

509
00:20:59.851 --> 00:21:03.120
<v Speaker 1>he knows more and we give them some food</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we taught him more and he just</v>

510
00:21:03.121 --> 00:21:06.210
<v Speaker 1>looked at us like we were silly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then like a couple of hours later</v>

511
00:21:06.211 --> 00:21:07.044
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

512
00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:08.550
<v Speaker 2>am I bad?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brang it.</v>

513
00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:12.600
<v Speaker 2>You told me this when it's not working.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing it well in the beginning they</v>

514
00:21:12.601 --> 00:21:15.150
<v Speaker 2>say sign language is a really good thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>to teach kids cause they can't really</v>

515
00:21:15.151 --> 00:21:16.910
<v Speaker 2>formulate the words yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The mouth.</v>

516
00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:19.710
<v Speaker 2>That's why they get frustrated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They start crying because I can't tell</v>

517
00:21:19.711 --> 00:21:22.050
<v Speaker 2>you what they want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they know what they want.</v>

518
00:21:22.051 --> 00:21:23.610
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't know a language yet.</v>

519
00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:24.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting.</v>

520
00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:26.390
<v Speaker 1>And he would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a huge prince fan.</v>

521
00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:29.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love playing records.</v>

522
00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:34.630
<v Speaker 1>And so my wife got me a dope record</v>
<v Speaker 1>player for Christmas and uh,</v>

523
00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:39.170
<v Speaker 1>we play Prince's purple rain on the air</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if I play anything else,</v>

524
00:21:39.171 --> 00:21:39.890
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

525
00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:41.760
<v Speaker 1>he just wants prints really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

526
00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:42.740
<v Speaker 1>and I'll go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want,</v>

527
00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:44.360
<v Speaker 1>you want to hear some music with dinner?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he'll,</v>

528
00:21:44.361 --> 00:21:46.870
<v Speaker 1>he'll run to the record player and he'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>start China.</v>

529
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.770
<v Speaker 1>How old is he?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's 14 months.</v>

530
00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:49.611
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

531
00:21:49.611 --> 00:21:51.800
<v Speaker 1>And so like he understands things like</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

532
00:21:51.801 --> 00:21:53.570
<v Speaker 1>get the ball and he'll get it and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll play.</v>

533
00:21:53.571 --> 00:21:58.571
<v Speaker 1>But I could see him wanting to say it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Occasionally he'll sit and just stop</v>

534
00:21:58.731 --> 00:22:01.280
<v Speaker 1>mocking me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll say get the boy.</v>

535
00:22:01.281 --> 00:22:04.350
<v Speaker 1>But I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could see him trying to just</v>

536
00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:11.990
<v Speaker 1>literally just start saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to say what I just said in the</v>

537
00:22:11.991 --> 00:22:13.260
<v Speaker 1>same rhythm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bang.</v>

538
00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:16.730
<v Speaker 2>He starts talking to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's [inaudible] wait man.</v>

539
00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:20.870
<v Speaker 2>I have little conversations with my kids</v>
<v Speaker 2>while I'm talking to them.</v>

540
00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:23.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking to them about what we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about,</v>

541
00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:27.020
<v Speaker 2>but most of my brain is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe you can talk.</v>

542
00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:27.883
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

543
00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.250
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe you're a person and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

544
00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:34.040
<v Speaker 2>we're uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a seven year old person and we're</v>

545
00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:35.960
<v Speaker 2>exploring the world together with</v>
<v Speaker 2>having,</v>

546
00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:40.070
<v Speaker 2>talking about stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my kids are way too aggressive with</v>

547
00:22:40.071 --> 00:22:42.440
<v Speaker 2>me physically though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially my littlest one.</v>

548
00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:44.150
<v Speaker 2>But my seventh girl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all girls,</v>

549
00:22:44.151 --> 00:22:45.410
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my seven year old,</v>

550
00:22:45.411 --> 00:22:49.100
<v Speaker 2>she fucking tackles me all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just full on charge.</v>

551
00:22:49.250 --> 00:22:52.280
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm indestructible when she takes</v>
<v Speaker 2>mma.</v>

552
00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:56.570
<v Speaker 2>So she will slam into me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grab a single leg thrower's shoulder</v>

553
00:22:56.571 --> 00:22:58.520
<v Speaker 2>into me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I plopped down on the bed,</v>

554
00:22:58.521 --> 00:23:01.520
<v Speaker 2>she gets on top of me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she drops on top of me and amount,</v>

555
00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:03.050
<v Speaker 2>she'll start punching my stomach.</v>

556
00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:05.600
<v Speaker 2>She thinks it's hilarious because I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a toy.</v>

557
00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:09.980
<v Speaker 2>She feels like she could just beat on me</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause I can just carry her and pick her</v>

558
00:23:09.981 --> 00:23:11.580
<v Speaker 2>up all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put her on my shoulders and she was</v>

559
00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:13.160
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this mother fucker could just carry me.</v>

560
00:23:13.161 --> 00:23:15.300
<v Speaker 2>I can't even can't even hurt him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:17.030
<v Speaker 2>Wail on him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's so funny.</v>

562

<v Speaker 2>It's hilarious man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's so aggressive,</v>

563
00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:21.710
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want my son to know how to do all that</v>

<v Speaker 2>it'll be a normal part of life so that</v>

566
00:23:25.821 --> 00:23:28.580
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like bullies and conflict,</v>

567
00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:30.590
<v Speaker 2>it won't bother them because I know how</v>
<v Speaker 2>to fight.</v>

568
00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:34.670
<v Speaker 2>I had to make bullies laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a big dude.</v>

569
00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:35.421
<v Speaker 2>Big Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>so like</v>

571
00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:42.710
<v Speaker 2>five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight sitting down when I used to,</v>

572

<v Speaker 2>I grew up in Maryland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I used to,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had public transit</v>

574
00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:48.050
<v Speaker 1>and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so whenever I would be on public transit</v>

575
00:23:48.051 --> 00:23:49.850
<v Speaker 1>I would always see the dude's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>

576
00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:52.220
<v Speaker 1>we got one and then I will have to stand</v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

577
00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:53.150
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh nevermind.</v>

579
00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:00.500
<v Speaker 1>funny.</v>

585
00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.180
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I only,</v>

586
00:24:08.181 --> 00:24:09.900
<v Speaker 1>I only told,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Collin Quinn,</v>

587
00:24:09.901 --> 00:24:11.070
<v Speaker 1>this story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

588
00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:15.260
<v Speaker 1>when I grew up in these apartments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pembrook apartments in Prince George's</v>

589
00:24:15.261 --> 00:24:16.094
<v Speaker 1>county,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maryland,</v>

590
00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:18.110
<v Speaker 1>there was his mum bullied,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

591
00:24:18.111 --> 00:24:21.080
<v Speaker 1>who would steal people's bikes and shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he would start fights or whatever.</v>

592
00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:23.480
<v Speaker 1>And so I had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I played sports,</v>

593
00:24:23.481 --> 00:24:23.900
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

594
00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:28.900
<v Speaker 1>so one of my trophies broke and my mom</v>
<v Speaker 1>took me to some place to fix it.</v>

595
00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:32.020
<v Speaker 1>And I did not know that there was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>place that existed when you,</v>

596
00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:33.850
<v Speaker 1>I just thought trophies appeared,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

597
00:24:33.851 --> 00:24:35.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a kid you just get a shot.</v>

598
00:24:35.181 --> 00:24:37.040
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when I saw this was the spot,</v>

599
00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:41.300
<v Speaker 1>what I used to do because I was saving</v>
<v Speaker 1>my allowance and I would go to the</v>

600
00:24:41.301 --> 00:24:44.180
<v Speaker 1>trophy spot and buy like a karate</v>
<v Speaker 1>trophy,</v>

601
00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:51.320
<v Speaker 1>just walk around the neighborhood just</v>
<v Speaker 1>long enough for this one dude to see me</v>

602
00:24:51.321 --> 00:24:55.280
<v Speaker 1>who I knew would be like the town crier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would always act embarrassed about</v>

603
00:24:55.281 --> 00:24:55.550
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

604
00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:56.271
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>

605
00:24:56.271 --> 00:24:57.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's how we talk.</v>

606
00:24:57.711 --> 00:24:59.340
<v Speaker 1>We say young and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

607
00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:02.070
<v Speaker 1>my mother got me taking karate and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm wanting to steal to,</v>

608
00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:02.490
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

609
00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:03.980
<v Speaker 1>you're going to cry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Nice like that.</v>

610

<v Speaker 1>I ain't gonna say shit.</v>

611
00:25:07.611 --> 00:25:09.090
<v Speaker 1>And then I would see it.</v>

612
00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:10.243
<v Speaker 1>So then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

613
00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:12.230
<v Speaker 1>and then like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

614
00:25:12.231 --> 00:25:15.020
<v Speaker 1>a couple of months ago by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go by and by a little bigger town,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Thank God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank God.</v>

617
00:25:19.701 --> 00:25:20.630
<v Speaker 1>No one was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

618
00:25:20.631 --> 00:25:21.650
<v Speaker 1>I can fight.</v>

619
00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:24.590
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was like the word got out enough</v>

620
00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:29.000
<v Speaker 1>because nobody knew karate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying like if you heard the dude</v>

621
00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:30.410
<v Speaker 1>did karate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was enough.</v>

622
00:25:30.411 --> 00:25:32.210
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't want to get embarrassed.</v>

623
00:25:32.211 --> 00:25:37.211
<v Speaker 1>So he gave me like free passage to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>various be be my corny self,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

626
00:25:41.851 --> 00:25:44.860
<v Speaker 1>Because what I did when I saw that store</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

627
00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:48.740
<v Speaker 1>and that's the piece of home,</v>

<v Speaker 1>70 bucks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big bucks and hour girl put it on.</v>

629
00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:53.510

<v Speaker 1>age.</v>

630
00:25:53.511 --> 00:25:54.290
<v Speaker 1>There's all that shit.</v>

631
00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:56.540
<v Speaker 1>Like just planning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said I know what he going to be.</v>

632
00:25:56.541 --> 00:25:58.300
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as soon as he saw me I'd go back in the</v>

633
00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:59.600
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want like a big,</v>

634
00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:01.540

<v Speaker 1>That's very clever.</v>

635
00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:05.720

<v Speaker 1>that couldn't keep his mouth shut.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know who that guy is.</v>

638
00:26:10.281 --> 00:26:11.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And He,</v>

639
00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:14.870
<v Speaker 1>and he was so funny too cause um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet he works for tmz now.</v>

640
00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:16.430
<v Speaker 1>Probably if he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

641
00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:18.950
<v Speaker 1>if he got out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he got out,</v>

642
00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:22.520
<v Speaker 1>if I'm right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that was in our neighborhood.</v>

643
00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:26.600
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were afraid to dream out loud.</v>

644

<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

645
00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:29.750

646
00:26:29.751 --> 00:26:32.780
<v Speaker 1>but I ain't tell nobody because I saw</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody else and say,</v>

647

<v Speaker 1>I want to be here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

648
00:26:33.701 --> 00:26:34.600
<v Speaker 1>Whatever man you ain't going to do.</v>

649
00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:38.990
<v Speaker 1>You can't say shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So funny how people want to squash</v>

650
00:26:38.991 --> 00:26:40.520
<v Speaker 1>dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

651
00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:42.560

<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 1>singing groups and uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>so in the 70s,</v>

744
00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:18.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they used to be music programs in all</v>

745
00:30:18.461 --> 00:30:21.250
<v Speaker 1>the schools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all these cats were coming out</v>

746
00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:23.080
<v Speaker 1>learning like instrumentation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>composition,</v>

747
00:30:23.081 --> 00:30:25.510
<v Speaker 1>like all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like an our era,</v>

748
00:30:25.511 --> 00:30:27.040
<v Speaker 1>they cut that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

750
00:30:29.231 --> 00:30:32.380
<v Speaker 1>they still played like live music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we would all try to form,</v>

00:30:32.381 --> 00:30:33.071
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go groups,</v>

<v Speaker 1>just like that.</v>

831
00:33:31.901 --> 00:33:33.660

<v Speaker 1>And that's how we met.</v>

834
00:33:37.801 --> 00:33:41.640
<v Speaker 1>And that was kind of like indicative of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the apartment complex.</v>

835
00:33:41.641 --> 00:33:45.840
<v Speaker 1>Like looking back at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like basically all single moms in</v>

836
00:33:45.841 --> 00:33:46.890
<v Speaker 1>that apartment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ah.</v>

837
00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:51.840
<v Speaker 1>And so all raising young boys and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>would all go outside and play and give</v>

838
00:33:51.841 --> 00:33:56.841
<v Speaker 1>each other bad information and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why to finger pop girls or</v>

839
00:33:58.441 --> 00:34:00.120
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it tried to do,</v>

840
00:34:00.121 --> 00:34:01.860
<v Speaker 1>back flip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it was.</v>

841
00:34:01.861 --> 00:34:03.840
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that was a,</v>

842
00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:07.380
<v Speaker 1>it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a great time in my life because I</v>

843
00:34:07.381 --> 00:34:12.381
<v Speaker 1>was born in The Bahamas and then when my</v>
<v Speaker 1>mom left my dad at nine months,</v>

844
00:34:12.870 --> 00:34:16.920
<v Speaker 1>she moved to DC for like a year and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pembrook apartments.</v>

845
00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:21.440
<v Speaker 1>So I was in pembrook apartments from</v>
<v Speaker 1>there until like 13 or 14 so why would</v>

846
00:34:21.441 --> 00:34:24.990
<v Speaker 1>you start doing comedy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started doing comedy in Maryland,</v>

847
00:34:24.991 --> 00:34:29.991
<v Speaker 1>man at the greenbelt comedy connection</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside was a huge picture of Martin</v>

848
00:34:32.010 --> 00:34:36.510
<v Speaker 1>Lawrence and Dave Chappelle was just</v>
<v Speaker 1>bubbling,</v>

849
00:34:36.511 --> 00:34:40.890
<v Speaker 1>starting to like pop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I actually saw Chappelle bomb in</v>

850
00:34:40.891 --> 00:34:44.250
<v Speaker 1>there and it isn't all of this is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>negative story.</v>

851
00:34:44.251 --> 00:34:47.490
<v Speaker 1>It was fantastic how it happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He went up and he was doing this stuff</v>

852
00:34:47.491 --> 00:34:49.770
<v Speaker 1>and it was a black crowd at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

853
00:34:49.771 --> 00:34:51.840
<v Speaker 1>he was young man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were the same age.</v>

854
00:34:51.841 --> 00:34:56.841
<v Speaker 1>So at the time we were both 19 and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

855
00:34:56.971 --> 00:34:58.770
<v Speaker 1>just trying to figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought he was great,</v>

856
00:34:58.771 --> 00:34:59.950
<v Speaker 1>but somebody was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>

857
00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:01.920
<v Speaker 1>And they just thought it just the</v>

860
00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:08.280
<v Speaker 1>Like he literally was saying it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he walked off stage and he sat</v>

861
00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:11.910
<v Speaker 1>right next to where I was and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that just bomb energy.</v>

862
00:35:11.911 --> 00:35:14.640
<v Speaker 1>He was just like anyone looking nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was just like,</v>

863
00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:17.910
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never seen anything like that happen.</v>

864

868
00:35:26.970 --> 00:35:29.010
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they walk off,</v>

869
00:35:29.011 --> 00:35:31.520
<v Speaker 1>they walk out together getting the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>car and drive off.</v>

870
00:35:31.530 --> 00:35:32.730
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

875
00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:43.470
<v Speaker 1>I started in that environment where I</v>
<v Speaker 1>learned how to perform first.</v>

876
00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:45.450
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had no substance.</v>

877

<v Speaker 1>I just knew how to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was trying not to get boots,</v>

894
00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:24.720

<v Speaker 1>I'm home.</v>

895
00:36:24.721 --> 00:36:25.530
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

896
00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:28.230
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a guy I went to eighth grade</v>

897
00:36:28.231 --> 00:36:29.610
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cat named Mike Brooks.</v>

898
00:36:29.730 --> 00:36:34.730
<v Speaker 1>He's like the mayor of DC comedy wise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had been doing it a year longer than</v>

899
00:36:34.891 --> 00:36:39.330
<v Speaker 1>me and took me around all the spots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my goal that summer was to just get</v>

900
00:36:39.331 --> 00:36:41.490
<v Speaker 1>paid cause I believe that you got paid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a professional.</v>

901
00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:45.870
<v Speaker 1>So at the end of the summer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy named pops gave me a crumpled</v>

902
00:36:45.871 --> 00:36:50.760
<v Speaker 1>up $25 to perform in front of like six</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in this big place in the</v>

903
00:36:50.770 --> 00:36:52.740
<v Speaker 1>Greenville,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the comedy connection of Laurel.</v>

904
00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:55.500
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after that you couldn't tell me nothing</v>

905
00:36:55.530 --> 00:36:58.110
<v Speaker 1>because we had performed in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

906
00:36:58.140 --> 00:37:02.580
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot of spots called cabarets</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the audience is not facing you.</v>

907
00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:06.840
<v Speaker 1>So you're on stage and they're at long</v>
<v Speaker 1>tables eating crabs and stuff and they,</v>

908
00:37:06.850 --> 00:37:09.070
<v Speaker 1>after Corinne and next bat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

909
00:37:09.690 --> 00:37:12.270
<v Speaker 1>And if I would get like a laugh or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

910
00:37:12.271 --> 00:37:12.751
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

911
00:37:12.751 --> 00:37:14.460
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing it.</v>

912
00:37:14.850 --> 00:37:16.630
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would,</v>

913
00:37:16.631 --> 00:37:18.610
<v Speaker 1>we would do crazy stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a headline.</v>

914
00:37:18.611 --> 00:37:23.611
<v Speaker 1>It would like go short and we would go</v>
<v Speaker 1>up after a headliner and eat it because</v>

915
00:37:25.501 --> 00:37:27.870
<v Speaker 1>he just had him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was the headliner,</v>

916
00:37:27.871 --> 00:37:31.200
<v Speaker 1>but for some reason he had a issue and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would go up next.</v>

917
00:37:31.290 --> 00:37:34.800
<v Speaker 1>I heard a headline to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Burt Christ was telling me about that</v>

918
00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:36.780
<v Speaker 1>where he would go on after the</v>
<v Speaker 1>headliner.</v>

919
00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:37.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause the headline,</v>

920
00:37:37.711 --> 00:37:39.810
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to do the drop check spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

921
00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:42.090
<v Speaker 1>So he would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would go up,</v>

922
00:37:42.330 --> 00:37:44.640
<v Speaker 1>someone would go up and do like 10</v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes.</v>

923
00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:47.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as that same summer,</v>

931
00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:00.210
<v Speaker 1>we were at one spot and they might say,</v>

<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

937
00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:12.030
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know if you weren't supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do that.</v>

938
00:38:12.090 --> 00:38:14.880
<v Speaker 1>And I'd get up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris Thomas Killing,</v>

939
00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:15.510
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:18.540
<v Speaker 1>he was the mayor of rap city used to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>this move and he does like a lot of</v>

941
00:38:18.541 --> 00:38:20.070
<v Speaker 1>impressions and he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

942
00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:24.750
<v Speaker 1>the crowd is literally like crying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still,</v>

943
00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:26.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm a go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm think I'm going to kill it.</v>

944
00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:31.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what's about to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Mike,</v>

945
00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:34.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went and I had to go first.</v>

946
00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:36.550
<v Speaker 1>That was the other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He set me up like,</v>

947
00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:37.410
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

949
00:38:38.170 --> 00:38:41.470
<v Speaker 1>So I basically had to take like what was</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming.</v>

950
00:38:41.830 --> 00:38:44.740
<v Speaker 1>So Chris leaves and it was no ill will</v>
<v Speaker 1>to none.</v>

951
00:38:44.741 --> 00:38:48.190
<v Speaker 1>He literally had to go do something and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they introduced me.</v>

952
00:38:48.191 --> 00:38:50.980
<v Speaker 1>I come out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this one I used to wear slacks and shirt</v>

953
00:38:50.981 --> 00:38:53.530
<v Speaker 1>was tucked in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just smelled like a college kid.</v>

954
00:38:53.531 --> 00:38:55.300
<v Speaker 1>Like I was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's up y'all?</v>

<v Speaker 1>All right bye.</v>

956
00:38:57.151 --> 00:38:58.510
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the checks are dropping.</v>

957
00:38:58.511 --> 00:39:02.000
<v Speaker 1>I didn't understand what that was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are looking at their bill man</v>

958
00:39:02.110 --> 00:39:03.410
<v Speaker 1>power rangers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a crazy life.</v>

959
00:39:07.010 --> 00:39:09.260
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight like I'm talking about sweat,</v>

960
00:39:09.290 --> 00:39:10.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to flush all terrible,</v>

961
00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:13.520
<v Speaker 1>terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll raise offstage and then,</v>

962
00:39:13.521 --> 00:39:16.520
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I got booed,</v>

963
00:39:16.521 --> 00:39:19.970
<v Speaker 1>but it was just silence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just no labs.</v>

964
00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:20.990
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

965
00:39:21.830 --> 00:39:24.170
<v Speaker 1>but Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he used to do this trick where he would</v>

966
00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:29.470
<v Speaker 1>pat his intro with Shitty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never did you see them on the Martin</v>

967
00:39:29.570 --> 00:39:31.840
<v Speaker 1>Lawrence show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see them opening fussin bird,</v>

968
00:39:31.850 --> 00:39:33.990
<v Speaker 1>you seen him on def jam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see,</v>

969
00:39:34.010 --> 00:39:35.120
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you ain't doing all that.</v>

970
00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:36.830
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta figure to you Megan Jordan.</v>

971
00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:42.340
<v Speaker 1>And then he went out and he did okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I just learned a lot of lessons</v>

972
00:39:42.351 --> 00:39:43.700
<v Speaker 1>in that era,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

973
00:39:43.701 --> 00:39:47.300
<v Speaker 1>like kind of keep going like gift the</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit ain't working,</v>

974
00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:48.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just keep going.</v>

975
00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:52.490
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really had so much confidence because</v>

976
00:39:52.491 --> 00:39:57.080
<v Speaker 1>I feel like that area with some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the toughest environments to get</v>

977
00:39:57.081 --> 00:39:57.770
<v Speaker 1>labs.</v>

978
00:39:57.770 --> 00:39:59.390
<v Speaker 1>So when I went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I went to the Midwest,</v>

979
00:39:59.391 --> 00:40:01.820
<v Speaker 1>I went to school at Notre Dame.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

980
00:40:01.821 --> 00:40:03.640
<v Speaker 1>this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm,</v>

981
00:40:03.690 --> 00:40:04.960
<v Speaker 1>people are friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

982
00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:07.070
<v Speaker 1>he's just going to be so easy to make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

983
00:40:07.071 --> 00:40:10.640
<v Speaker 1>to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I started a comedy or funny bone</v>

984
00:40:10.641 --> 00:40:13.730
<v Speaker 1>opened up in south bend and I became</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the House Mc there and I would</v>

985
00:40:13.731 --> 00:40:18.050
<v Speaker 1>watch the national headlines come</v>
<v Speaker 1>through and that helps right?</v>

986
00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:20.300
<v Speaker 1>Tremendously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's when I learned substance.</v>

987
00:40:20.301 --> 00:40:20.991
<v Speaker 1>Like I was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

988
00:40:20.991 --> 00:40:23.360
<v Speaker 1>I gotta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gotta have something to say.</v>

989
00:40:23.450 --> 00:40:24.660
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it interesting too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you would,</v>

990
00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:28.760
<v Speaker 1>if you would work at a place like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remembered how it wasn't Boston when I</v>

991
00:40:28.761 --> 00:40:30.350
<v Speaker 1>was first starting out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I was lucky,</v>

992
00:40:30.351 --> 00:40:30.700
<v Speaker 1>I get it</v>

993
00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:35.700
<v Speaker 2>like a hosting gig and I would go get</v>
<v Speaker 2>you to see the quality of some people's</v>

994
00:40:35.741 --> 00:40:39.250
<v Speaker 2>material versus others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would see a guy coming in as a</v>

995
00:40:39.251 --> 00:40:40.220
<v Speaker 2>headline and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

996
00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:43.570
<v Speaker 2>this is a headliner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just like barely adequate.</v>

997
00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:47.110
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you'd watch them all weekend and</v>

998
00:40:47.111 --> 00:40:48.580
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a whack show.</v>

999
00:40:48.581 --> 00:40:50.860
<v Speaker 2>And then the next week it'd be Bill</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hicks or something and you go,</v>

1000
00:40:50.861 --> 00:40:53.020
<v Speaker 2>Oh fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Next level.</v>

1001
00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:54.370
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh Jesus.</v>

1002
00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:57.340
<v Speaker 2>Like you realize like it's the quality</v>
<v Speaker 2>of your thinking.</v>

1003
00:40:57.370 --> 00:40:59.910
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That'd be like peop people or chime.</v>

1004
00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:00.321
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

1005
00:41:00.321 --> 00:41:02.410
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're tuning in to what you're saying</v>

1006
00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:05.590
<v Speaker 2>and some sort of a weird way that hasn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>totally been defined yet.</v>

1007
00:41:06.070 --> 00:41:07.720
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when someone is up there and they</v>

1008
00:41:07.721 --> 00:41:10.300
<v Speaker 2>just got some great material,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've got great shit.</v>

1009
00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:14.170
<v Speaker 2>It's like he puts a smile on your face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it gets your brain lights up.</v>

1010
00:41:14.171 --> 00:41:15.390
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

1013
00:41:17.371 --> 00:41:17.900
<v Speaker 1>I love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1014
00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:18.840
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know you could do that.</v>

1015
00:41:18.841 --> 00:41:20.760
<v Speaker 1>What kind of did that with the iphone?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

1016
00:41:20.761 --> 00:41:23.340
<v Speaker 1>it is like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sets a personal thing for me.</v>

1017
00:41:23.341 --> 00:41:25.560
<v Speaker 1>Like when I see somebody abusing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do get it.</v>

1018
00:41:25.561 --> 00:41:26.394
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ugh.</v>

1019
00:41:26.490 --> 00:41:28.140
<v Speaker 1>But now that I'm a little older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just go out.</v>

1020
00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:30.280
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't affect me like it used to.</v>

1021
00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:32.320
<v Speaker 1>I used to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what you mean.</v>

1022
00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:34.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I first out I would get offended.</v>

1023
00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:36.550
<v Speaker 2>Angry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1024
00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:37.830
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1025
00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:38.693

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:40.610
<v Speaker 2>well whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1027
00:41:40.611 --> 00:41:43.820
<v Speaker 2>I think it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we realize like what's a waste of</v>

1028
00:41:43.821 --> 00:41:45.470
<v Speaker 2>energy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's good to use.</v>

1029
00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:47.900
<v Speaker 2>Use that on yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like to look at your own material and</v>

1030
00:41:47.901 --> 00:41:48.290
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1031
00:41:48.290 --> 00:41:50.090
<v Speaker 2>why the fuck am I doing this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fix this.</v>

1032
00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:51.410
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's going to benefit you.</v>

1033
00:41:51.411 --> 00:41:53.200
<v Speaker 2>But doing it to other people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just a waste</v>

1034
00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:54.630
<v Speaker 1>waste.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

1035
00:41:54.990 --> 00:41:56.940
<v Speaker 1>I spent some of my early twenties doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

1036
00:41:56.970 --> 00:41:58.290
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah.</v>

1037
00:41:58.291 --> 00:41:59.730
<v Speaker 1>started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1038
00:41:59.850 --> 00:42:01.380
<v Speaker 1>when you talk about Australia,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that Dji was cause I used to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said he lived there for a while.</v>

1040

<v Speaker 1>He lived there and I asked him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1041
00:42:06.361 --> 00:42:07.830
<v Speaker 1>why did you move to Australia?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

1042
00:42:07.831 --> 00:42:08.880
<v Speaker 1>no guns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no gangs,</v>

<v Speaker 1>in the states.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's why he came back.</v>

1047
00:42:17.010 --> 00:42:18.120
<v Speaker 1>How long did he live there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>For?</v>

1048
00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:19.660
<v Speaker 1>Several years.</v>

1083
00:43:43.770 --> 00:43:45.600
<v Speaker 2>And he goes and then reality starts to</v>
<v Speaker 2>set it.</v>

1084
00:43:45.601 --> 00:43:47.700
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even have a fucking job.</v>

1085
00:43:51.490 --> 00:43:54.600
<v Speaker 2>How could it not trained?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Still came in last tastic he's</v>

1086
00:43:54.601 --> 00:43:56.510
<v Speaker 2>fantastic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was the first black</v>

1087
00:43:56.620 --> 00:44:00.530
<v Speaker 1>comedian I heard who didn't grow up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1088
00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:01.630
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's stick wasn't,</v>

1089
00:44:01.631 --> 00:44:02.770
<v Speaker 1>I grew up poor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1090
00:44:03.010 --> 00:44:06.790
<v Speaker 1>He was like middle class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He went to law school and he just talked</v>

1091
00:44:06.791 --> 00:44:07.570
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1092
00:44:07.570 --> 00:44:08.351
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can talk about that.</v>

1093
00:44:08.351 --> 00:44:10.300
<v Speaker 1>Because a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I first started,</v>

1094
00:44:10.301 --> 00:44:13.120
<v Speaker 1>a lot of comedians taking the stage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all felt like they had to fit into</v>

1095
00:44:13.121 --> 00:44:15.610
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a thing that just happened.</v>

1096
00:44:15.611 --> 00:44:19.600
<v Speaker 1>But then when we talked to him offstage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like way more interest in off state</v>

1097
00:44:19.610 --> 00:44:20.710
<v Speaker 1>march.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You talk about that,</v>

1098
00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:21.573
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1099
00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:24.860
<v Speaker 2>Do you think it was because they felt</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they had to fit the mold of the</v>

1100
00:44:24.861 --> 00:44:28.760
<v Speaker 2>popular comedians?</v>
<v Speaker 2>People wanted a certain kind of comedian</v>

1101
00:44:28.761 --> 00:44:29.541
<v Speaker 2>and they felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1102
00:44:29.541 --> 00:44:30.950
<v Speaker 2>I got to talk about the shit that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to,</v>

1103
00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:32.070
<v Speaker 2>how you make</v>

1104
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:32.910
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

1105
00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:35.100
<v Speaker 1>And then if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you stay in it long enough,</v>

1106
00:44:35.101 --> 00:44:39.900
<v Speaker 1>you start to just go because for a time</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had an act for a black room and then</v>

1107
00:44:39.901 --> 00:44:42.330
<v Speaker 1>act for white room and it just got</v>
<v Speaker 1>exhausting.</v>

1108
00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:45.530
<v Speaker 1>I used to be physical and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah</v>

<v Speaker 2>these people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you just kind of become what you,</v>

1111
00:44:51.850 --> 00:44:54.760
<v Speaker 2>you know already where that's why those</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that work,</v>

1112
00:44:54.761 --> 00:44:57.670

<v Speaker 2>when it comes to a real comedy club.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You will see that.</v>

<v Speaker 2>the store and fall.</v>

1116
00:45:03.491 --> 00:45:08.491

<v Speaker 2>It's horrendous because they're just</v>

<v Speaker 2>used to like witty references and clever</v>
<v Speaker 2>subject manner is yes and comedy.</v>

1118
00:45:16.190 --> 00:45:18.580
<v Speaker 2>It's so supportive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very supportive,</v>

1119
00:45:18.650 --> 00:45:20.620
<v Speaker 2>which is nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a nice to have that,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I think you're one of the top.</v>

1201
00:48:16.990 --> 00:48:18.230
<v Speaker 2>Are you guys in the world?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

1202
00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:20.490
<v Speaker 2>Doing that makes me feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That makes it,</v>

1203
00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:22.680
<v Speaker 2>it's so funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1204
00:48:23.970 --> 00:48:28.970
<v Speaker 2>So many I'm doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be doing like some,</v>

1205
00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:33.120
<v Speaker 2>some things that I've always wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do years ago,</v>

1206
00:48:33.330 --> 00:48:36.420
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't know to ask for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1207
00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:39.000
<v Speaker 2>That was the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always thought that people see your</v>

1208
00:48:39.001 --> 00:48:42.180
<v Speaker 2>work and then hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what happened with you?</v>

1209
00:48:42.181 --> 00:48:44.040
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause you started working as a writer.</v>

1210
00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:45.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's when they,</v>

1211
00:48:45.931 --> 00:48:48.930
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they give you a job and then you think</v>

1212
00:48:48.931 --> 00:48:52.260
<v Speaker 2>like this is what I do now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that job there's,</v>

1213
00:48:52.290 --> 00:48:54.570
<v Speaker 2>there's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no free ride.</v>

1214
00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:58.140
<v Speaker 2>Like to get that money for that job is</v>
<v Speaker 2>nice and it gives you stability,</v>

1215
00:48:58.141 --> 00:49:01.110
<v Speaker 2>but it takes away from the potential</v>
<v Speaker 2>earning of your standup.</v>

1216
00:49:01.470 --> 00:49:03.270
<v Speaker 2>And then the dude that you started out</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

1217
00:49:03.630 --> 00:49:06.510
<v Speaker 2>they're balling out of control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're selling out places and people</v>

1218
00:49:06.511 --> 00:49:07.770
<v Speaker 2>don't know who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that to me,</v>

1219
00:49:07.771 --> 00:49:10.470
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy when I see you on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1220
00:49:10.471 --> 00:49:14.820
<v Speaker 2>this guy is a world class headline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like everybody should know when Smith.</v>

1221
00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:15.581
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1222
00:49:15.581 --> 00:49:18.490
<v Speaker 2>And so it just drives me nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1223

<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember that dreads.</v>

1227
00:49:29.810 --> 00:49:32.460
<v Speaker 1>I love history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's what I was just describing.</v>

1228
00:49:32.670 --> 00:49:36.630

<v Speaker 1>Like Ian used to yell at the audience,</v>

<v Speaker 1>like</v>

1231
00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:49.040

<v Speaker 1>be like yelling and then Bob not falling</v>

1233
00:49:50.730 --> 00:49:52.650
<v Speaker 1>oh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when he cut his dreads he was</v>

1234
00:49:52.651 --> 00:49:54.360
<v Speaker 1>like more centered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more zen.</v>

1235
00:49:54.361 --> 00:49:55.890
<v Speaker 1>Just standing there talking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1236
00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:58.830
<v Speaker 1>well then he became Vegan and now he</v>
<v Speaker 1>falls asleep constantly.</v>

<v Speaker 1>She has no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no dizzy.</v>

1238
00:50:00.180 --> 00:50:02.490
<v Speaker 1>When I get on the plane with him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just take pictures of him.</v>

1239
00:50:02.550 --> 00:50:05.190
<v Speaker 1>I have like 10 pictures on my phone of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ian out cold.</v>

1240
00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:08.630
<v Speaker 1>He gets US plane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as he sits down ugly,</v>

1241
00:50:09.150 --> 00:50:13.890
<v Speaker 1>like instantly I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got this motherfucker face and take</v>

1242
00:50:13.891 --> 00:50:17.220

<v Speaker 1>them to him and with a bunch of z's on</v>

1246
00:50:22.610 --> 00:50:24.270

<v Speaker 1>It's just kind of a thing,</v>

1247
00:50:24.271 --> 00:50:25.040
<v Speaker 1>like when I'm old</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1250
00:50:29.930 --> 00:50:32.570
<v Speaker 2>definitely make flying easier if you can</v>

<v Speaker 1>Come on one at a time.</v>

1279
00:51:31.990 --> 00:51:34.690
<v Speaker 1>14 months old man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't know anything yet in this.</v>

1280
00:51:34.691 --> 00:51:35.820
<v Speaker 1>Fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1281
00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:37.830
<v Speaker 1>it's like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1282
00:51:38.130 --> 00:51:40.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you learn a lot about yourself,</v>

1283
00:51:40.001 --> 00:51:41.470
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you that you learned that</v>

1284
00:51:41.471 --> 00:51:42.790
<v Speaker 1>year enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1285
00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:44.560
<v Speaker 1>it was the biggest lesson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I'm enough.</v>

1286
00:51:44.590 --> 00:51:45.970
<v Speaker 1>I walk in the door and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1287
00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:46.821
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1288
00:51:46.821 --> 00:51:50.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to put on a shelf on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like my wife says when he hears my</v>

1289
00:51:50.711 --> 00:51:51.670
<v Speaker 1>voice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he lights up.</v>

1290
00:51:51.700 --> 00:51:53.590
<v Speaker 1>Like if I call them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>

1291
00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:54.341
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1292
00:51:54.341 --> 00:51:56.050
<v Speaker 1>I just like talking to them sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I,</v>

1293
00:51:56.110 --> 00:51:57.820
<v Speaker 1>when I first had him and see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know what to say to him.</v>

1294
00:51:57.821 --> 00:52:01.590
<v Speaker 1>So I would just do old hip hop lyrics to</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

1295
00:52:01.730 --> 00:52:03.560
<v Speaker 1>this kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just wrapping stuff.</v>

1296
00:52:04.030 --> 00:52:06.850
<v Speaker 1>Who the hell is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] 46 in the morning,</v>

1297
00:52:06.851 --> 00:52:08.140
<v Speaker 1>crack of dawn and know him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your honor.</v>

1298
00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:13.320
<v Speaker 1>And then he'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what to say there man.</v>

1299
00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:16.460
<v Speaker 1>And then I just started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would talk to him about my day</v>

1300
00:52:16.461 --> 00:52:17.294
<v Speaker 1>sometimes.</v>

1301
00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:20.460
<v Speaker 2>And it's cool man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very weird feeling.</v>

1302
00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:22.890
<v Speaker 2>We see a little tiny human being that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>dependent upon you.</v>

1303
00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:25.470
<v Speaker 2>It changes your perception of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything.</v>

1304
00:52:25.590 --> 00:52:27.330
<v Speaker 2>And it's also like all of us were that</v>
<v Speaker 2>age.</v>

1305
00:52:27.331 --> 00:52:29.940
<v Speaker 2>So it's kind of weird when I look at</v>
<v Speaker 2>adults,</v>

1306
00:52:30.030 --> 00:52:30.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1307
00:52:30.900 --> 00:52:34.800
<v Speaker 2>you were 14 months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talk about that all time that I look</v>

1308
00:52:34.801 --> 00:52:36.390
<v Speaker 2>at people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's grown up babies now.</v>

1309
00:52:36.660 --> 00:52:38.340
<v Speaker 2>I used to look at people in a static</v>
<v Speaker 2>state,</v>

1310
00:52:38.341 --> 00:52:40.590
<v Speaker 2>like I'd see it year old dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an 80 year old dude.</v>

1311
00:52:40.620 --> 00:52:42.480
<v Speaker 2>That's how he is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How he's always been.</v>

1312
00:52:42.970 --> 00:52:43.920
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a baby.</v>

1313
00:52:43.980 --> 00:52:45.690
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he became this guy.</v>

1314
00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:48.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he had dreams and he trashed it.</v>

1315
00:52:48.091 --> 00:52:49.860
<v Speaker 2>And did it work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1316
00:52:49.870 --> 00:52:54.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm fascinated by people's stories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like shattered dreams and people with</v>

1317
00:52:54.061 --> 00:52:56.250
<v Speaker 2>failed expectations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some of the saddest people</v>

1318
00:52:56.251 --> 00:52:58.800
<v Speaker 2>you'll ever get to meet if they just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for whatever reason,</v>

1319
00:52:58.801 --> 00:53:00.690
<v Speaker 2>it didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't figure it out,</v>

1320
00:53:01.170 --> 00:53:03.420
<v Speaker 2>whatever mental block,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever the problem was,</v>

1321
00:53:03.421 --> 00:53:05.250
<v Speaker 2>they just never figured it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1322
00:53:05.490 --> 00:53:09.360
<v Speaker 2>and that's when no charlatans sneak in</v>
<v Speaker 2>that pretend to be able to sell them.</v>

1323
00:53:09.930 --> 00:53:12.090
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta do is what you got to do is</v>

1324
00:53:12.091 --> 00:53:14.250
<v Speaker 1>push harder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to dream big,</v>

1325
00:53:14.430 --> 00:53:19.140
<v Speaker 1>and you got to set your goals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's an easy workshop that we're going</v>

1326
00:53:19.141 --> 00:53:21.120

<v Speaker 1>People are doing things,</v>

1403
00:56:15.281 --> 00:56:19.060
<v Speaker 1>but there's a real problem with people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are just motivators.</v>

1404
00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:20.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all they're doing.</v>

1405
00:56:20.890 --> 00:56:22.900
<v Speaker 1>All you're doing is motivated and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of,</v>

1406
00:56:23.110 --> 00:56:24.250
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot</v>

1407
00:56:24.250 --> 00:56:26.770
<v Speaker 2>of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm always getting these fucking memes</v>

1408
00:56:26.771 --> 00:56:27.381
<v Speaker 2>from people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1409
00:56:27.381 --> 00:56:29.080
<v Speaker 2>who's this guy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I'll go to this page.</v>

1410
00:56:29.081 --> 00:56:31.150
<v Speaker 2>It's all filled with memes and then you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1411
00:56:31.151 --> 00:56:32.080
<v Speaker 2>like you'll look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

1412
00:56:32.081 --> 00:56:33.610
<v Speaker 2>he's a motivational speaker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1413
00:56:33.611 --> 00:56:34.720
<v Speaker 2>you're a motivational speaker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1414
00:56:34.721 --> 00:56:35.930
<v Speaker 2>what have you done?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Had He,</v>

1415
00:56:36.250 --> 00:56:41.250
<v Speaker 2>it's weird to be a motivational speaker</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's never done a one thing.</v>

1416
00:56:42.060 --> 00:56:47.060
<v Speaker 2>Like you have to start a company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come up something or life coaches.</v>

1417
00:56:48.011 --> 00:56:50.080
<v Speaker 2>Same kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1418
00:56:51.310 --> 00:56:55.330
<v Speaker 2>But the weird thing is some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there are trainers that have never</v>

1419
00:56:55.331 --> 00:56:57.430
<v Speaker 2>had professional fights and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>great trainers.</v>

1420
00:56:57.940 --> 00:57:00.940
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they have studied the game like so</v>

1421
00:57:00.941 --> 00:57:03.310
<v Speaker 2>deeply.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They understand all the various aspects</v>

1422
00:57:03.311 --> 00:57:04.144
<v Speaker 2>of the game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1423
00:57:04.210 --> 00:57:06.280
<v Speaker 2>And then they become just really good at</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1424
00:57:07.110 --> 00:57:10.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm really good at coaching because they</v>
<v Speaker 2>were like real legitimate analysts.</v>

1425
00:57:10.660 --> 00:57:12.190
<v Speaker 2>Is that possible to do with life?</v>

1426
00:57:12.550 --> 00:57:16.390
<v Speaker 2>Can you be a person who has never really</v>
<v Speaker 2>accomplished much in term nothing</v>

1427
00:57:16.420 --> 00:57:18.100
<v Speaker 2>creatively,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>

1428
00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:20.920
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're not some world champion</v>

1429
00:57:20.921 --> 00:57:23.080
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not some guy who's gone out there</v>

1430
00:57:23.081 --> 00:57:26.710
<v Speaker 2>and accomplish great things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not like Sebastian younger award</v>

1431
00:57:26.711 --> 00:57:27.544
<v Speaker 2>journalists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not.</v>

1432
00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:29.480
<v Speaker 2>You're just some guy who's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1433
00:57:29.481 --> 00:57:32.950
<v Speaker 2>you got to do is realize that you face</v>
<v Speaker 2>fear in the eyes.</v>

1434
00:57:33.130 --> 00:57:36.880
<v Speaker 2>You tell fear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the nature of your soul.</v>

1435
00:57:37.570 --> 00:57:40.150
<v Speaker 2>It's the approach man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like they have,</v>

1436
00:57:40.210 --> 00:57:42.460
<v Speaker 2>you can't tell people what they have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>

1437
00:57:43.060 --> 00:57:47.800
<v Speaker 2>but I feel like you like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I feel like you're a bigger motivator</v>

1438
00:57:47.860 --> 00:57:51.400
<v Speaker 2>than a motivational speaker because you</v>
<v Speaker 2>motivate by example,</v>

1439
00:57:51.460 --> 00:57:53.410
<v Speaker 2>but you just motivated by doing you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see what I'm saying?</v>

1440
00:57:53.411 --> 00:57:55.750
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's more motivational than</v>

1441
00:57:57.520 --> 00:58:00.400
<v Speaker 2>telling people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to tell you how I do what I</v>

1442
00:58:00.401 --> 00:58:01.480
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like I don't want to,</v>

1443
00:58:01.490 --> 00:58:02.350
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1444
00:58:02.351 --> 00:58:02.950
<v Speaker 2>Joe did that.</v>

1445
00:58:02.950 --> 00:58:03.550
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's dope.</v>

1446
00:58:03.550 --> 00:58:04.770
<v Speaker 2>Then you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you just go,</v>

1447
00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:05.530
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1448
00:58:05.530 --> 00:58:07.510
<v Speaker 2>Joe comes from comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

1449
00:58:07.540 --> 00:58:08.780
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

1450
00:58:08.790 --> 00:58:09.750
<v Speaker 2>If he did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I let me,</v>

1451
00:58:10.060 --> 00:58:11.950
<v Speaker 2>what am I not doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1452
00:58:11.951 --> 00:58:14.590
<v Speaker 2>Like to me that's more motivational</v>
<v Speaker 2>then.</v>

1453
00:58:14.620 --> 00:58:16.450
<v Speaker 2>That's how I feel coming to my front</v>
<v Speaker 2>door.</v>

1454
00:58:16.930 --> 00:58:19.450
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

1455
00:58:19.480 --> 00:58:21.220
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when people are always looking for some</v>

1456
00:58:21.221 --> 00:58:24.880
<v Speaker 2>sort of a s of course shortcut,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1457

<v Speaker 2>like someone is going to end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes people can give you like I</v>

<v Speaker 2>lifter and you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>when he talks about hard work and</v>
<v Speaker 2>dedication and you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>work.</v>

1466
00:58:48.491 --> 00:58:52.360
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to accomplish some great</v>
<v Speaker 2>task before they go out and do this.</v>

<v Speaker 1>My Body,</v>

1627
01:05:13.220 --> 01:05:14.810
<v Speaker 2>if I'm in a room and I'm supposed to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>awake,</v>

1630
01:05:25.970 --> 01:05:28.650
<v Speaker 2>around that area.</v>

1631

1633
01:05:34.651 --> 01:05:37.200

<v Speaker 1>to throw board on my face.</v>

1634
01:05:37.201 --> 01:05:39.510

<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

1643
01:05:58.941 --> 01:06:00.500

<v Speaker 2>It's human nature,</v>

1644
01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:02.690

<v Speaker 2>especially in mixed company.</v>

<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1648
01:06:06.650 --> 01:06:10.790

<v Speaker 2>harassment that people just sort of like</v>

1652
01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:22.100
<v Speaker 2>Why they went to the office,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they couldn't wait to get to work</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1656
01:06:28.481 --> 01:06:31.480
<v Speaker 1>my mom had a thing like that when I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a kid.</v>

1657
01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:34.060
<v Speaker 1>I didn't understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but somebody was,</v>

1658
01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:35.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she needed the job.</v>

01:06:38.470 --> 01:06:40.840
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1661
01:06:40.841 --> 01:06:45.130

<v Speaker 1>cause she knew it was gonna be his word</v>

1662
01:06:45.131 --> 01:06:47.500
<v Speaker 1>against hers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1663
01:06:47.501 --> 01:06:48.760
<v Speaker 1>predators don't keep notes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1664
01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:51.540
<v Speaker 1>They don't keep notes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So right.</v>

1665
01:06:51.650 --> 01:06:54.850
<v Speaker 1>Mom was like October 8th Dah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

1669
01:06:59.190 --> 01:07:01.210
<v Speaker 1>It's just don't try to go off memory</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>

1670
01:07:01.211 --> 01:07:03.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you're keep notes,</v>

1671
01:07:03.821 --> 01:07:05.440
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>still you against them.</v>

1672
01:07:05.470 --> 01:07:06.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it still is.</v>

1673
01:07:06.371 --> 01:07:08.610
<v Speaker 1>But back then boss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

<v Speaker 1>cause that's how,</v>

1675
01:07:11.140 --> 01:07:13.630
<v Speaker 1>who I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who had somebody else had no,</v>

1676
01:07:13.930 --> 01:07:17.620
<v Speaker 1>the Weinstein thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody kept like notes and that's why,</v>

1677
01:07:17.621 --> 01:07:18.454
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause you,</v>

1678
01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:21.040
<v Speaker 1>when you have a lot of money you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely litigate it.</v>

1679
01:07:21.041 --> 01:07:23.750
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm a sue under the right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when somebody,</v>

1680
01:07:24.010 --> 01:07:25.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think his legal team looked at it,</v>

1681
01:07:25.931 --> 01:07:28.150
<v Speaker 1>they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you better go to Europe for some deep</v>

1682
01:07:28.151 --> 01:07:30.880
<v Speaker 1>counseling cause however they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1683
01:07:31.030 --> 01:07:33.590
<v Speaker 1>Europe counseling and a different level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the,</v>

1684
01:07:33.591 --> 01:07:35.310
<v Speaker 1>I believe the continent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1685
01:07:35.860 --> 01:07:37.150
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My head on straight,</v>

1686
01:07:37.151 --> 01:07:38.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna stay over here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1687
01:07:38.820 --> 01:07:40.900
<v Speaker 1>It's to be able to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

1688
01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:42.010
<v Speaker 1>Well like</v>

1689
01:07:42.010 --> 01:07:46.090
<v Speaker 2>you look at like the Kevin Spacey thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that's how he would run a set.</v>

1690
01:07:46.420 --> 01:07:49.670
<v Speaker 2>Apparently he'd be on the set and he'd</v>
<v Speaker 2>just be grabbing dicks on the set.</v>

1691
01:07:49.671 --> 01:07:50.650
<v Speaker 2>Serious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1692
01:07:50.651 --> 01:07:52.410
<v Speaker 2>That's what they're all saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1693
01:07:52.420 --> 01:07:55.030
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that's the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but all the people in the House of card</v>

1694
01:07:55.031 --> 01:07:56.710
<v Speaker 2>set,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what all the complaints are</v>

1695
01:07:56.711 --> 01:08:00.880
<v Speaker 2>coming out was that he would like grab</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys dicks that we're taking them places</v>

1696
01:08:00.881 --> 01:08:03.070
<v Speaker 2>and he'd have like a PA that had to take</v>
<v Speaker 2>him somewhere.</v>

1697
01:08:03.071 --> 01:08:04.810
<v Speaker 2>He reached in his pants and grabbed his</v>
<v Speaker 2>dick.</v>

1698
01:08:04.811 --> 01:08:08.310
<v Speaker 2>He was just a dick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dick crab grabbed um,</v>

1699
01:08:08.410 --> 01:08:11.470
<v Speaker 2>whose dick was it that he grabbed like</v>
<v Speaker 2>some famous dude,</v>

1700
01:08:11.530 --> 01:08:13.240
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Richard Dreyfus.</v>

1701
01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:15.890
<v Speaker 2>He grabbed his son's Dick and him in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>room.</v>

1702
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:19.520
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was just a crazy Dick grabber stop</v>

1703
01:08:19.521 --> 01:08:23.300
<v Speaker 2>maniac.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crazy drunk Dick grabbing,</v>

1704
01:08:23.890 --> 01:08:25.520
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reservation.</v>

1705
01:08:26.570 --> 01:08:30.350
<v Speaker 2>And I think this is their social</v>
<v Speaker 2>environment as well as their working</v>

1706
01:08:30.351 --> 01:08:31.060
<v Speaker 2>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1707
01:08:31.060 --> 01:08:33.580
<v Speaker 2>They're constantly around all these</v>
<v Speaker 2>people and they're,</v>

1708
01:08:33.670 --> 01:08:36.040
<v Speaker 2>they're in this king roll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yay.</v>

1709
01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:39.680
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're a star of a show that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're the executive producer of and</v>

1710
01:08:39.681 --> 01:08:42.200
<v Speaker 2>it's a giant hit for Netflix and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>the king.</v>

1711
01:08:42.650 --> 01:08:46.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm Frank Underwood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the king of House of cards and all the</v>

1712
01:08:46.431 --> 01:08:49.420
<v Speaker 2>people rely on you for their jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is one of the things they're saying</v>

1713
01:08:49.430 --> 01:08:53.000
<v Speaker 2>about house of cards is that 2000 people</v>
<v Speaker 2>could be out of a job.</v>

1714
01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:54.860
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is crazy.</v>

1715
01:08:55.370 --> 01:09:00.370
<v Speaker 2>So this guy was like at the epicenter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he was the p the king of 2000</v>

1716
01:09:01.641 --> 01:09:05.400
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he would show up at work and his ego.</v>

1717
01:09:07.250 --> 01:09:09.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm the king,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1718
01:09:09.741 --> 01:09:14.730
<v Speaker 2>And I think that is like natural male</v>
<v Speaker 2>predatory behavior when um,</v>

1719
01:09:14.830 --> 01:09:18.780
<v Speaker 2>I think when a man gets into a position</v>
<v Speaker 2>where he's the king and all these people</v>

1720
01:09:18.810 --> 01:09:20.570
<v Speaker 2>Cya,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe we get you something sire.</v>

1721
01:09:20.690 --> 01:09:23.360
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're on a set and you're like</v>
<v Speaker 2>the big star,</v>

1722
01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:25.550
<v Speaker 2>all these people are stumbling around</v>
<v Speaker 2>sire.</v>

1723
01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:27.770
<v Speaker 2>Maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe we get you something sire.</v>

1724
01:09:27.970 --> 01:09:31.220
<v Speaker 2>Like you start thinking like a king.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're Harvey Weinstein,</v>

1725
01:09:31.221 --> 01:09:33.020
<v Speaker 2>like think about all the people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>covered up for him.</v>

1726
01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:36.170
<v Speaker 2>He had it written in his contract was</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>

1727
01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:38.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also just think of that work ethic</v>

1728
01:09:38.301 --> 01:09:39.134
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1729
01:09:39.890 --> 01:09:44.180
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He like just to work that hard.</v>

1730
01:09:44.210 --> 01:09:48.620
<v Speaker 2>And then the part that trips me out is</v>
<v Speaker 2>when people would show up to the victims</v>

1731
01:09:48.621 --> 01:09:50.320
<v Speaker 2>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell me everything to me.</v>

1732
01:09:50.540 --> 01:09:52.130
<v Speaker 2>We're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to take him down.</v>

1733
01:09:52.131 --> 01:09:54.440
<v Speaker 2>And then those people were investigators</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they go,</v>

1734
01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:55.670
<v Speaker 2>I work for Weinstein,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bitch.</v>

1735
01:09:55.671 --> 01:09:58.760
<v Speaker 2>Like you better not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know how fucked up that it has to</v>

1736
01:09:58.761 --> 01:10:01.790
<v Speaker 2>have you walking around in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they're predators,</v>

1737
01:10:01.791 --> 01:10:02.120
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1738
01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:05.630
<v Speaker 2>And they'd look for like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1739
01:10:05.631 --> 01:10:08.300
<v Speaker 2>it's this weird shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like if you,</v>

1740
01:10:08.750 --> 01:10:10.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had like a parent or somebody</v>

1741
01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:12.710
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>baby do you think is safe to,</v>

1742
01:10:13.270 --> 01:10:15.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meet with him at three in the morning.</v>

1743
01:10:15.111 --> 01:10:16.520
<v Speaker 2>And they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mama is cool.</v>

1744
01:10:16.850 --> 01:10:18.350
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trust me.</v>

1745
01:10:18.351 --> 01:10:19.910
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you trust me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1746
01:10:19.911 --> 01:10:23.300
<v Speaker 2>And then when something happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they feel like they can't say anything</v>

1747
01:10:23.450 --> 01:10:27.380
<v Speaker 2>because they don't want the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told you so they don't want to,</v>

1748
01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:28.010
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1749
01:10:28.010 --> 01:10:29.270
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then that,</v>

1750
01:10:29.300 --> 01:10:33.230
<v Speaker 2>that moment can turn into two weeks and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saying that you had six month,</v>

1751
01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:34.280
<v Speaker 2>then you're living,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

1752
01:10:34.281 --> 01:10:38.020
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so that's how it can happen when</v>

1753
01:10:38.021 --> 01:10:40.460
<v Speaker 2>you're just so embarrassed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1754
01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:43.910
<v Speaker 2>Or you don't want to embarrass or hurt</v>
<v Speaker 2>other people at times.</v>

1755
01:10:43.970 --> 01:10:46.700
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes people don't say anything</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they don't want to make their</v>

1756
01:10:46.701 --> 01:10:49.040
<v Speaker 2>parents feel what type of way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1757
01:10:49.250 --> 01:10:52.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot on a lot of women that had</v>

1758
01:10:52.131 --> 01:10:56.060
<v Speaker 2>been rape victims that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the stigma of being a rape victim,</v>

1759
01:10:56.900 --> 01:10:57.950
<v Speaker 2>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>publicly,</v>

1760
01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:01.940
<v Speaker 2>is it's so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so terrifying on tariffs.</v>

1761
01:11:01.950 --> 01:11:02.960
<v Speaker 2>They don't even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

1762
01:11:02.961 --> 01:11:06.020
<v Speaker 2>I'll just let it slide and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like man,</v>

1763
01:11:06.110 --> 01:11:07.490
<v Speaker 2>it's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1764
01:11:07.820 --> 01:11:09.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm personally,</v>

1765
01:11:09.561 --> 01:11:13.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm happy that people are finally</v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking,</v>

1766
01:11:13.770 --> 01:11:14.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming out.</v>

1767
01:11:14.911 --> 01:11:15.740
<v Speaker 2>Cause it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1768
01:11:15.740 --> 01:11:17.080
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot of jobs opening up.</v>

1769
01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:22.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm really happy that people are finding</v>
<v Speaker 2>that courage to just,</v>

1770
01:11:22.550 --> 01:11:24.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>speak that truth and we'll see what</v>

1771
01:11:24.511 --> 01:11:28.530
<v Speaker 2>happens on the other side of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will we be a healthier society saying</v>

1772
01:11:28.531 --> 01:11:31.290
<v Speaker 2>this for a while that I think that</v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually we're going to get to a point</v>

1773
01:11:31.291 --> 01:11:33.930
<v Speaker 2>where we could read each other's minds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really think that that's on the,</v>

1774
01:11:33.931 --> 01:11:36.330
<v Speaker 2>on the horizon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's just a matter of time</v>

1775
01:11:36.331 --> 01:11:39.510
<v Speaker 2>before no one can ever do anything like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that ever again.</v>

1776
01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:43.650
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's what you're seeing</v>
<v Speaker 2>now with like this Harvey Weinstein Shit</v>

1777
01:11:43.651 --> 01:11:45.570
<v Speaker 2>and the Kevin Spacey Shit and all this</v>
<v Speaker 2>other stuff.</v>

1778
01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:48.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean you see varying degrees of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of them seem pretty innocuous.</v>

1779
01:11:48.541 --> 01:11:50.850
<v Speaker 2>Like Al Franken just likes to grab butts</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he takes a picture.</v>

1780
01:11:50.851 --> 01:11:55.530
<v Speaker 2>It's like not the best practice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not the worst thing in the world,</v>

1781
01:11:55.790 --> 01:12:00.120
<v Speaker 2>but I think we're going to get to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>point where all of this is look back on</v>

1782
01:12:00.121 --> 01:12:04.560
<v Speaker 2>like wearing powdered wigs or slavery or</v>
<v Speaker 2>any crazy old shit that we just don't</v>

1783
01:12:04.561 --> 01:12:05.450
<v Speaker 2>tolerate it anymore.</v>

1784
01:12:05.470 --> 01:12:08.220
<v Speaker 2>Just nutty behavior that you just can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>do anymore.</v>

1785
01:12:08.460 --> 01:12:12.000
<v Speaker 2>I think we're going to get to a point</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you're going to be able to talk to</v>

1786
01:12:12.001 --> 01:12:15.240
<v Speaker 2>someone and you're going to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>see what's going on in their head and</v>

1787
01:12:15.241 --> 01:12:16.770
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would have to be a real piece of</v>

1788
01:12:16.771 --> 01:12:20.220
<v Speaker 2>shit to victimize them cause you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to get to see what their exact</v>

1789
01:12:20.221 --> 01:12:21.870
<v Speaker 2>feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh you just need this job.</v>

1790
01:12:21.930 --> 01:12:24.270
<v Speaker 2>You're not really attracted to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't like me at all,</v>

1791
01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:27.270
<v Speaker 2>like you just need this job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you might have let me jerk off on</v>

1792
01:12:27.271 --> 01:12:29.880
<v Speaker 2>you if you could keep this job because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's gross.</v>

1793
01:12:30.300 --> 01:12:31.490
<v Speaker 2>I gotta stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1794
01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:33.750
<v Speaker 2>It was interesting too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that this is a direct reaction</v>

1795
01:12:33.751 --> 01:12:36.660
<v Speaker 2>to us not communicating with one</v>
<v Speaker 2>another.</v>

1796
01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:39.060
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a day like today,</v>

1797
01:12:39.061 --> 01:12:41.490
<v Speaker 2>like everything is texts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like put my boys in a single day,</v>

1798
01:12:41.910 --> 01:12:44.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they getting girls to texts like have</v>

1799
01:12:44.131 --> 01:12:44.964
<v Speaker 2>you talked to her yet?</v>

1800
01:12:45.450 --> 01:12:48.600
<v Speaker 2>But she's sending me like all this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're not really,</v>

1801
01:12:48.601 --> 01:12:50.370
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think can be taken out of context,</v>

1802
01:12:50.371 --> 01:12:52.680
<v Speaker 2>what have you before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

1803
01:12:52.681 --> 01:12:55.080
<v Speaker 2>it is getting to the place where you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to have to be really clear with</v>

1804
01:12:55.081 --> 01:12:57.070
<v Speaker 2>your intentions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm married to see it.</v>

1805
01:12:57.120 --> 01:12:59.040
<v Speaker 2>You can be able to see tensions on</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1806
01:12:59.070 --> 01:13:00.840
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know another thing I think that is</v>

1807
01:13:00.841 --> 01:13:03.180
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not pro prostitution,</v>

1808
01:13:03.330 --> 01:13:06.630
<v Speaker 2>but I think it should be legal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think if it was legal you would</v>

1809
01:13:06.631 --> 01:13:08.640
<v Speaker 2>have way less of this gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1810
01:13:08.730 --> 01:13:09.180
<v Speaker 2>Wait.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hello?</v>

1811
01:13:09.180 --> 01:13:10.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause that's what it is,</v>

1812
01:13:10.261 --> 01:13:12.090
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just that release and people need</v>

1813
01:13:12.091 --> 01:13:13.680
<v Speaker 2>to craziness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's forbidden.</v>

1814
01:13:13.681 --> 01:13:14.550
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot,</v>

1815
01:13:14.551 --> 01:13:17.520
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of factors going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think one of the things that would</v>

1816
01:13:17.521 --> 01:13:22.170
<v Speaker 2>change is that people that want like</v>
<v Speaker 2>ugly dudes like Harvey Weinstein,</v>

1817
01:13:22.171 --> 01:13:24.030
<v Speaker 2>it just want sex and here you're going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to just go get it.</v>

1818
01:13:24.030 --> 01:13:26.490
<v Speaker 2>But I think for him it's like a power</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing too definite.</v>

1819
01:13:26.510 --> 01:13:29.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was banging all those really hot like</v>

1820
01:13:29.011 --> 01:13:32.220
<v Speaker 2>famous chicks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this drug dealer told me a long time</v>

1821
01:13:32.220 --> 01:13:33.690
<v Speaker 2>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was two things he was talking about,</v>

1822
01:13:33.691 --> 01:13:34.800
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it says two things,</v>

1823
01:13:34.801 --> 01:13:37.530
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand ass whooping or a secret.</v>

1824
01:13:38.550 --> 01:13:40.980
<v Speaker 2>And if you came with they ass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you better get a secret.</v>

1825
01:13:42.930 --> 01:13:44.610
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>

1826
01:13:44.611 --> 01:13:46.200
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1827
01:13:46.201 --> 01:13:50.880
<v Speaker 2>I feel like Harvey doing that shit to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of people because they became huge</v>

1828
01:13:50.881 --> 01:13:51.714
<v Speaker 2>stars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1829
01:13:51.730 --> 01:13:54.540
<v Speaker 2>There's no reason for them to ever have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to respect him again.</v>

1830
01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:56.760
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he was like,</v>

1831
01:13:56.790 --> 01:13:57.540
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you,</v>

1832
01:13:57.540 --> 01:13:58.371
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with this is,</v>

1833
01:13:58.371 --> 01:13:59.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take my whatever,</v>

1834
01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:01.120
<v Speaker 2>whatever his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that would,</v>

1835
01:14:01.140 --> 01:14:03.840
<v Speaker 2>apparently he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wouldn't negotiate it into deals.</v>

1836
01:14:04.350 --> 01:14:05.790
<v Speaker 2>He would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you fuck me,</v>

1837
01:14:05.850 --> 01:14:08.820
<v Speaker 2>you'll get more lines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll get part to get this.</v>

1838
01:14:08.821 --> 01:14:11.130
<v Speaker 2>You get that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's like,</v>

1839
01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:13.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that is like my main,</v>

1840
01:14:13.391 --> 01:14:15.130
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what,</v>

1841
01:14:15.610 --> 01:14:17.920
<v Speaker 1>when do you know your worth?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1842
01:14:17.921 --> 01:14:18.850
<v Speaker 1>And when you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1843
01:14:18.851 --> 01:14:20.470
<v Speaker 1>the view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

1844
01:14:20.471 --> 01:14:22.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't need this here over here.</v>

1845
01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:27.750
<v Speaker 1>Or I've already,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the work I've already done like my,</v>

1846
01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:30.430
<v Speaker 1>my last work paid for all this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1847
01:14:30.431 --> 01:14:32.470
<v Speaker 1>Where are you getting your money?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're getting your money from something</v>

1848
01:14:32.471 --> 01:14:33.610
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1849
01:14:33.611 --> 01:14:35.560
<v Speaker 1>Like instead of thinking about it like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>harassment settlement.</v>

1883
01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:01.180
<v Speaker 1>Like what the fuck could you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly done?</v>

<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1892
01:16:20.250 --> 01:16:24.520

<v Speaker 1>I pretended I couldn't walk good.</v>

1893
01:16:24.521 --> 01:16:27.580
<v Speaker 1>And</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always get nervous.</v>

1894
01:16:27.581 --> 01:16:30.580
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to sit down 35 I put the</v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable.</v>

1895
01:16:30.730 --> 01:16:31.980
<v Speaker 1>It worked out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1896
01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:34.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what he did.</v>

1897
01:16:34.180 --> 01:16:35.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just one.</v>

1898
01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:38.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean another one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he paid 12 there was like</v>

1899
01:16:38.321 --> 01:16:40.570
<v Speaker 1>several different ones that he had to</v>
<v Speaker 1>pay off.</v>

1900
01:16:40.571 --> 01:16:43.720
<v Speaker 1>Like this guy was on a rampage for years</v>
<v Speaker 1>and years.</v>

1901
01:16:43.721 --> 01:16:44.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a trick man.</v>

1902
01:16:44.951 --> 01:16:47.980
<v Speaker 1>He was on the streets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a trick that pays well.</v>

1903
01:16:48.010 --> 01:16:52.660
<v Speaker 1>He's a house money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>35,000,035 come on man.</v>

1904
01:16:52.750 --> 01:16:54.940
<v Speaker 1>And everybody already knows you're a</v>
<v Speaker 1>freak.</v>

1905
01:16:54.970 --> 01:16:58.480
<v Speaker 1>So it's like you wasted 35 million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like everybody knows you're a freak.</v>

1906
01:16:58.570 --> 01:17:00.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so who do we,</v>

1907
01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:02.570
<v Speaker 1>where do you start?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like is it the platform who,</v>

1908
01:17:02.571 --> 01:17:05.390
<v Speaker 1>who gave them the platform and that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1909
01:17:05.470 --> 01:17:08.080
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a bunch of things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things that I think it is</v>

1910
01:17:08.110 --> 01:17:10.310
<v Speaker 1>is that that world</v>

1911
01:17:10.340 --> 01:17:14.570
<v Speaker 2>is so sexually charged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the men are like these powerful</v>

1912
01:17:14.571 --> 01:17:18.890
<v Speaker 2>wealthy men and all the women are hot as</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck and the off short skirts on and</v>

1913
01:17:18.891 --> 01:17:23.150
<v Speaker 2>they're all talking about like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like American values and it's all</v>

1914
01:17:23.151 --> 01:17:25.910
<v Speaker 2>conservative values.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all super,</v>

1915
01:17:25.950 --> 01:17:30.850
<v Speaker 2>super breast behind closed doors as</v>
<v Speaker 2>button popping and fucking</v>

1916
01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:34.910
<v Speaker 2>trading,</v>
<v Speaker 2>snoring,</v>

1917
01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:36.553
<v Speaker 2>Pussy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lips,</v>

1918
01:17:36.700 --> 01:17:39.400
<v Speaker 2>Woo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maca</v>

1919
01:17:40.910 --> 01:17:45.320
<v Speaker 2>being a policy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what's so puritanical too though,</v>

1920
01:17:45.321 --> 01:17:46.220
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1921
01:17:46.610 --> 01:17:49.280
<v Speaker 2>they don't teach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't teach six education</v>

1922
01:17:50.910 --> 01:17:54.140
<v Speaker 2>to younger kids is never cool to talk</v>
<v Speaker 2>about this shit.</v>

1923
01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:57.860
<v Speaker 2>So there's definitely that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's also the suppression,</v>

1924
01:17:58.100 --> 01:18:01.190
<v Speaker 2>the ones that are like super religious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>super suppressed.</v>

1925
01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:04.460
<v Speaker 2>Like those are the ones that have this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have a need for an outlet.</v>

1926
01:18:04.550 --> 01:18:05.660
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1927
01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:06.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I feel like it's,</v>

1928
01:18:07.020 --> 01:18:08.440
<v Speaker 2>it's equal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1929
01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:12.500
<v Speaker 2>So the amount that you put out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you equally have,</v>

1930
01:18:12.730 --> 01:18:13.850
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1965
01:19:41.060 --> 01:19:43.440
<v Speaker 2>a performance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what it's going to affect it.</v>

1966
01:19:43.550 --> 01:19:44.930
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how it's going to land when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1967
01:19:44.931 --> 01:19:48.590
<v Speaker 2>but when I think it was really a report</v>
<v Speaker 2>on it or you got a band,</v>

1968
01:19:48.591 --> 01:19:52.430
<v Speaker 2>people that interrupt like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially like bad hecklers and</v>

1969
01:19:52.431 --> 01:19:56.660
<v Speaker 2>interrupt hecklers sometimes man can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1970
01:19:56.661 --> 01:19:58.820
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're setting up like for a special,</v>

1971
01:19:58.821 --> 01:19:59.630
<v Speaker 2>you getting ready.</v>

1972
01:19:59.630 --> 01:20:03.140
<v Speaker 2>They can fuck up the flow of a boat for</v>
<v Speaker 2>weeks all ways.</v>

1973
01:20:03.141 --> 01:20:04.010
<v Speaker 2>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seemed like,</v>

1974
01:20:04.190 --> 01:20:07.530
<v Speaker 2>it seems like they always come out when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're setting up for something of card.</v>

1975
01:20:07.531 --> 01:20:09.350
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you just,</v>

1976
01:20:09.420 --> 01:20:10.870
<v Speaker 2>you just rocking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1977
01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:12.630
<v Speaker 2>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gotta,</v>

1978
01:20:12.631 --> 01:20:14.130
<v Speaker 2>I gotta,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gotta lay down.</v>

1979
01:20:15.020 --> 01:20:20.020
<v Speaker 2>He had a comb in the moral arbiters of</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're allowed to say and not say.</v>

1980
01:20:20.561 --> 01:20:22.080
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't even understand where this is</v>

1981
01:20:22.081 --> 01:20:24.120
<v Speaker 2>going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're not even allowing this bit</v>

1982
01:20:24.121 --> 01:20:25.980
<v Speaker 2>to take its full.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get to the end,</v>

1983
01:20:26.010 --> 01:20:29.130
<v Speaker 2>it'll be vindicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just let it play out and play out.</v>

1984
01:20:29.131 --> 01:20:31.950
<v Speaker 2>Trust me in the end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the piece of shit.</v>

1985
01:20:31.990 --> 01:20:33.270
<v Speaker 2>Just trust me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trust me.</v>

1986
01:20:33.390 --> 01:20:34.770
<v Speaker 2>Everyone wins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1987
01:20:35.010 --> 01:20:37.140
<v Speaker 2>But that's a weird thing about live</v>
<v Speaker 2>performance.</v>

1988
01:20:37.141 --> 01:20:38.590
<v Speaker 2>That's what makes it so exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1989
01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:42.900
<v Speaker 2>You are there to catch debris.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Occasionally it will be a tire will fall</v>

1990
01:20:42.901 --> 01:20:45.720
<v Speaker 2>off one of them nascar things and</v>
<v Speaker 2>launching a crowd.</v>

1991
01:20:45.720 --> 01:20:46.553
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1992
01:20:46.950 --> 01:20:47.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

1993
01:20:47.981 --> 01:20:49.620
<v Speaker 2>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1994
01:20:49.621 --> 01:20:50.760
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to keep swinging that bat</v>

1995
01:20:50.761 --> 01:20:52.620
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to keep pushing it.</v>

1996
01:20:52.860 --> 01:20:55.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well then also the real terrifying thing</v>

1997
01:20:55.231 --> 01:20:59.790
<v Speaker 2>for me is the throwing away the material</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then redoing your whole act every</v>

1998
01:20:59.791 --> 01:21:01.290
<v Speaker 2>two years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1999
01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:03.400
<v Speaker 2>That's the real terrifying thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really about,</v>

2000
01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:04.710
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's about a year and a half,</v>

2001
01:21:04.740 --> 01:21:07.680
<v Speaker 2>it seems like lately that's my schedule.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And at a year and a half.</v>

2002
01:21:07.681 --> 01:21:08.940
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2003
01:21:09.200 --> 01:21:12.480
<v Speaker 2>like right now I'm super nervous cause</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like a couple months out and then</v>

2004
01:21:12.481 --> 01:21:16.710
<v Speaker 2>once I film I'm fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just figured out how to make these</v>

2005
01:21:16.711 --> 01:21:18.490
<v Speaker 2>bits all work good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

2006
01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:19.950
<v Speaker 2>And it's exciting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2007
01:21:19.951 --> 01:21:22.680
<v Speaker 2>It's like I could grab this for five</v>
<v Speaker 2>years now,</v>

2008
01:21:22.790 --> 01:21:25.320
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's healthier though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh it's way healthier.</v>

2009
01:21:25.321 --> 01:21:27.720
<v Speaker 2>But it is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what you're talking about too is</v>

2010
01:21:27.721 --> 01:21:28.820
<v Speaker 2>something that I've gone through.</v>

2011
01:21:28.820 --> 01:21:31.950
<v Speaker 2>It's like the older you get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the less you,</v>

2012
01:21:32.250 --> 01:21:35.610
<v Speaker 2>the less you have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your faith isn't as strong.</v>

2013
01:21:35.611 --> 01:21:37.320
<v Speaker 2>Like when you're younger you gotta I</v>
<v Speaker 2>know him to come with one boy.</v>

2014
01:21:37.321 --> 01:21:38.700
<v Speaker 2>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something's gonna Happen to me.</v>

2015
01:21:38.701 --> 01:21:41.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking my faith is better now than</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was before.</v>

2016
01:21:41.970 --> 01:21:43.760
<v Speaker 2>I work harder at it now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2017
01:21:43.830 --> 01:21:46.620
<v Speaker 2>It's like to me it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's directly proportional.</v>

2018
01:21:46.621 --> 01:21:49.620
<v Speaker 2>Like how much time I'm actually spend</v>
<v Speaker 2>writing and working on new shit and</v>

2019
01:21:49.621 --> 01:21:53.160
<v Speaker 2>trying out new shit versus like whether</v>
<v Speaker 2>or not a thing I could do it again.</v>

2020
01:21:53.220 --> 01:21:54.410
<v Speaker 2>You know like if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

2021
01:21:54.420 --> 01:21:56.880
<v Speaker 2>as long as you're paying attention,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's always subject.</v>

2022
01:21:56.881 --> 01:21:59.820
<v Speaker 2>I feel like subjects too are essentially</v>
<v Speaker 2>like scaffolding.</v>

2023
01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:01.890
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And once you have the scaffolding,</v>

2024
01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:05.550
<v Speaker 2>then you've got to fill it up with jokes</v>
<v Speaker 2>and build us the phone part two and</v>

2025
01:22:05.551 --> 01:22:07.080
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2026
01:22:07.100 --> 01:22:09.780
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love the work man and it's so like I'm</v>

2027
01:22:09.781 --> 01:22:13.800
<v Speaker 2>at a place why I love it even more now</v>
<v Speaker 2>than when I first started.</v>

2028
01:22:13.830 --> 01:22:15.770
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it was just a blind love for it,</v>

2029
01:22:15.780 --> 01:22:20.580
<v Speaker 2>just how it made me feel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But now I've really light getting in</v>

2030
01:22:20.581 --> 01:22:25.581
<v Speaker 2>there and trying to like take it places</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's so exciting to me,</v>

2031
01:22:26.071 --> 01:22:27.930
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like I'm so,</v>

2032
01:22:27.931 --> 01:22:30.030
<v Speaker 2>I feel so present and awake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

2033
01:22:30.031 --> 01:22:33.750
<v Speaker 2>Like when I'm on stage and I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm excited about it.</v>

2034
01:22:33.751 --> 01:22:35.400
<v Speaker 2>But it is true though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2035
01:22:36.180 --> 01:22:39.360
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I wished that this was all I could</v>

2036
01:22:39.361 --> 01:22:40.530
<v Speaker 2>focus on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

2037
01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:41.730
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Visiting my family,</v>

2038
01:22:41.731 --> 01:22:44.790
<v Speaker 2>that's all I want to do is stand up and</v>
<v Speaker 2>family.</v>

2039
01:22:45.100 --> 01:22:48.180
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the reasons why it is so</v>
<v Speaker 2>exciting is because it's just slightly</v>

2040
01:22:48.181 --> 01:22:50.790
<v Speaker 2>out of your reach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's obviously within your reach.</v>

2041
01:22:50.791 --> 01:22:51.890
<v Speaker 2>Talent wise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2042
01:22:51.930 --> 01:22:54.180
<v Speaker 2>Just like you still have this writing</v>
<v Speaker 2>job,</v>

2043
01:22:54.210 --> 01:22:55.240
<v Speaker 2>there's still good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2044
01:22:55.950 --> 01:23:00.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the reason why I never intended it</v>

2045
01:23:00.271 --> 01:23:03.270
<v Speaker 2>to be a TV writer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2046
01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:04.980
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even know that was a job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2047
01:23:05.050 --> 01:23:06.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean like I</v>

2048
01:23:06.310 --> 01:23:09.720
<v Speaker 1>went one day on the set,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2049
01:23:09.770 --> 01:23:14.760
<v Speaker 1>a friend of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a comic and then became show</v>

2050
01:23:14.770 --> 01:23:18.930
<v Speaker 1>runner of everybody hates Chris.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he uh,</v>

2051
01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:20.860
<v Speaker 1>called me out the blue and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

2052
01:23:20.861 --> 01:23:23.610
<v Speaker 1>you want to come read lines with Chris?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

2053
01:23:24.370 --> 01:23:26.740
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I went on set in,</v>

2054
01:23:26.741 --> 01:23:29.920
<v Speaker 1>the job was to be his voice because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a voiceover show.</v>

2055
01:23:29.921 --> 01:23:34.360
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was his voice for the actors for</v>

2056
01:23:34.361 --> 01:23:35.980
<v Speaker 1>the pacing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'd be off on the side.</v>

2057
01:23:35.981 --> 01:23:39.760
<v Speaker 1>My mother always said like I was just be</v>
<v Speaker 1>reading it and uh,</v>

2058
01:23:39.860 --> 01:23:41.260
<v Speaker 1>then I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh this is cool.</v>

2059
01:23:41.650 --> 01:23:42.401
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2060
01:23:42.401 --> 01:23:44.920
<v Speaker 1>this is like the best acting class cause</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm seeing,</v>

2061
01:23:44.950 --> 01:23:48.140
<v Speaker 1>cause at the time I was also like acting</v>
<v Speaker 1>classes and doing all of that.</v>

2062
01:23:49.150 --> 01:23:51.130
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm seeing what it's like on set,</v>

2063
01:23:51.131 --> 01:23:53.350
<v Speaker 1>how to act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I will watch costars come in and</v>

2064
01:23:53.351 --> 01:23:55.270
<v Speaker 1>just rumble because it's not acting.</v>

2065
01:23:55.270 --> 01:23:58.120
<v Speaker 1>It's not a save acne class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you're acting on set,</v>

2066
01:23:58.121 --> 01:23:59.440
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a boom.</v>

2067
01:23:59.441 --> 01:24:00.430
<v Speaker 1>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't give a fuck.</v>

2068
01:24:00.820 --> 01:24:02.070
<v Speaker 1>I roll it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cable.</v>

2069
01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:03.110
<v Speaker 1>This guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was saying,</v>

2070
01:24:03.900 --> 01:24:05.540
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to like,</v>

2071
01:24:05.560 --> 01:24:07.450
<v Speaker 1>you know how to find it in these raw</v>
<v Speaker 1>environments.</v>

2072
01:24:07.451 --> 01:24:11.770
<v Speaker 1>So I used to watch that and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because I'm a comedian first,</v>

2073
01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:15.570
<v Speaker 1>when they would run lines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would hear stuff that could be funny</v>

2074
01:24:15.580 --> 01:24:18.430
<v Speaker 1>and I would just write it on my script,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I wouldn't say anything.</v>

2075
01:24:18.431 --> 01:24:20.920
<v Speaker 1>I knew better than trying to say</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

2076
01:24:21.610 --> 01:24:24.780
<v Speaker 1>And then one day show runner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his name's Ali,</v>

2077
01:24:24.830 --> 01:24:25.540
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It was just,</v>

2082
01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:33.670
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to make it better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

2083
01:24:33.671 --> 01:24:36.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he laughed and then he threw the London</v>

2084
01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:39.850
<v Speaker 1>and she laughed and then they did it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole crew laugh and then they</v>

2085
01:24:39.851 --> 01:24:42.010
<v Speaker 1>recorded it and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2086
01:24:42.011 --> 01:24:42.400
<v Speaker 1>that's cool.</v>

2087
01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:43.570
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even think like,</v>

2088
01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:44.770
<v Speaker 1>oh that was great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just like,</v>

2089
01:24:44.771 --> 01:24:46.220
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what it should have been in like,</v>

2090
01:24:46.230 --> 01:24:47.590
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

2091
01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:50.230
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris rock came up and he was like,</v>

2092

<v Speaker 1>You say this and change it.</v>

2093
01:24:52.391 --> 01:24:54.160
<v Speaker 1>And they laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I was like,</v>

2094
01:24:54.161 --> 01:24:56.740
<v Speaker 1>I got another one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was the first time I'd ever</v>

2095
01:24:57.250 --> 01:24:59.880
<v Speaker 1>seen Chris like in person this day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

2096
01:24:59.890 --> 01:25:00.970
<v Speaker 1>I got another one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I give it to them,</v>

2097
01:25:00.971 --> 01:25:05.080
<v Speaker 1>they throw it in and they laugh louder</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause it was like you say this gave him,</v>

2098
01:25:05.110 --> 01:25:07.240
<v Speaker 1>they laugh and not as loud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't know.</v>

2099
01:25:07.241 --> 01:25:09.880
<v Speaker 1>I probably should have shut up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had another one cause I was like,</v>

2100
01:25:10.540 --> 01:25:11.710
<v Speaker 1>if I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if Chris or like me,</v>

2101
01:25:11.711 --> 01:25:12.521
<v Speaker 1>this would be great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2102
01:25:12.521 --> 01:25:13.710
<v Speaker 1>that kind of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2103
01:25:13.890 --> 01:25:14.461
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this one,</v>

2104
01:25:14.461 --> 01:25:16.120
<v Speaker 1>they laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do it,</v>

2105
01:25:16.121 --> 01:25:17.290
<v Speaker 1>they laugh loud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris goes,</v>

2106
01:25:17.291 --> 01:25:18.124
<v Speaker 1>I got nothing.</v>

2107
01:25:18.140 --> 01:25:19.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2108
01:25:19.510 --> 01:25:22.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so then at the end everyone's in</v>

2109
01:25:22.271 --> 01:25:25.270
<v Speaker 1>line shaking Chris's hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I shake his hand,</v>

2110
01:25:25.271 --> 01:25:26.400
<v Speaker 1>he puts his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2111
01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:28.030
<v Speaker 1>like does the elbow thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

2112
01:25:28.031 --> 01:25:29.530
<v Speaker 1>what's up Nigga?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2113
01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:32.220
<v Speaker 1>Chris Rock called me nigger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He like,</v>

2114
01:25:32.710 --> 01:25:37.710
<v Speaker 1>I was so happy I playing and did like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>college gig or whatever and came back</v>

2115
01:25:38.921 --> 01:25:40.080
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then that,</v>

2116
01:25:40.081 --> 01:25:43.900
<v Speaker 1>that grew into me doing what they call a</v>
<v Speaker 1>punch of writing.</v>

2117
01:25:43.901 --> 01:25:45.380
<v Speaker 1>But I didn't need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know it.</v>

2118
01:25:45.430 --> 01:25:46.450
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

2119
01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:51.190
<v Speaker 1>I enjoyed helping them make the show</v>
<v Speaker 1>funnier because that's like my,</v>

2120
01:25:51.340 --> 01:25:54.520
<v Speaker 1>like if I hear something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh that's dope.</v>

2121
01:25:54.760 --> 01:25:55.490
<v Speaker 1>Go for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2122
01:25:55.490 --> 01:25:57.760
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of always been my nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I had this older,</v>

2123
01:25:57.790 --> 01:25:59.600
<v Speaker 1>one time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this older black dude was at the store</v>

2124
01:25:59.601 --> 01:26:02.590
<v Speaker 1>and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop helping other people get better.</v>

2125
01:26:02.990 --> 01:26:04.670
<v Speaker 1>Keep that shit for yourself and Hossein.</v>

2126
01:26:04.880 --> 01:26:06.020
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who said that?</v>

2127
01:26:06.050 --> 01:26:07.160
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he just,</v>

2128
01:26:07.161 --> 01:26:10.170
<v Speaker 1>it's like he came out the shadows and</v>
<v Speaker 1>just said it to me because what counts?</v>

2129
01:26:10.210 --> 01:26:11.300
<v Speaker 1>We get off stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

2130
01:26:11.310 --> 01:26:12.320
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should do this and that.</v>

2131
01:26:12.530 --> 01:26:13.750
<v Speaker 1>And then I would go do my work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

2132
01:26:13.790 --> 01:26:14.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing that.</v>

2133
01:26:14.930 --> 01:26:15.281
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2134
01:26:15.281 --> 01:26:17.180
<v Speaker 1>but whatever you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

2135
01:26:17.181 --> 01:26:18.020
<v Speaker 1>I could hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

2136
01:26:18.021 --> 01:26:19.210
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe go here.</v>

2137
01:26:19.211 --> 01:26:22.490
<v Speaker 1>That'd be dope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people will listen in and some</v>

2138
01:26:22.491 --> 01:26:24.470
<v Speaker 1>people have amazing careers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some people were like,</v>

2139
01:26:24.650 --> 01:26:26.540
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I started figuring out,</v>

2140
01:26:26.750 --> 01:26:28.190
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't want me to say nothing.</v>

2141
01:26:28.191 --> 01:26:30.410
<v Speaker 1>I ain't gonna say nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I did eventually just stop</v>

2142
01:26:30.411 --> 01:26:32.920
<v Speaker 1>saying stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's just kinda just to kind folds</v>

2143
01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:34.670
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I used to be,</v>

2144
01:26:34.671 --> 01:26:35.150
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2145
01:26:35.150 --> 01:26:38.780
<v Speaker 1>I used to just love hearing what people</v>
<v Speaker 1>were trying to do and then go,</v>

2146
01:26:38.810 --> 01:26:39.920
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't,</v>

2147
01:26:39.921 --> 01:26:42.020
<v Speaker 1>someone on the outside can see it better</v>
<v Speaker 1>than you can.</v>

2148
01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:43.760
<v Speaker 1>And I wasn't annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I wasn't like,</v>

2149
01:26:43.761 --> 01:26:44.481
<v Speaker 1>but I haven't like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aw man,</v>

2150
01:26:44.481 --> 01:26:45.440
<v Speaker 1>that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe this.</v>

2151
01:26:45.470 --> 01:26:49.520
<v Speaker 1>And if they laughed it was cool and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally didn't think about it again.</v>

2152
01:26:49.521 --> 01:26:52.690
<v Speaker 1>Like I wouldn't even remember then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2153
01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:56.660
<v Speaker 1>so that evolved into me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they used to let me rewrite scenes</v>

2154
01:26:56.661 --> 01:26:59.150
<v Speaker 1>on set because I was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way this particular show runner</v>

2155
01:26:59.151 --> 01:27:02.270
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his whole philosophy was funniest wins.</v>

2156
01:27:02.300 --> 01:27:04.520
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you got it,</v>

2157
01:27:04.521 --> 01:27:05.630
<v Speaker 1>you got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

2158
01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:08.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he would bring stuff in from the</v>

2159
01:27:08.751 --> 01:27:10.520
<v Speaker 1>writer's room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I was rarely in,</v>

2160
01:27:11.090 --> 01:27:14.870
<v Speaker 1>cause I wasn't a writer at that time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when they would put it on its</v>

2161
01:27:14.871 --> 01:27:17.300
<v Speaker 1>feet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could hear how certain people</v>

2162
01:27:17.301 --> 01:27:19.850
<v Speaker 1>couldn't say they was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would sound funny,</v>

2163
01:27:19.851 --> 01:27:22.550
<v Speaker 1>you're saying a different word or maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>it should just take a different turn.</v>

2164
01:27:22.551 --> 01:27:24.500
<v Speaker 1>And we were kind of on the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he would let me rewrite.</v>

2165
01:27:25.790 --> 01:27:29.360
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that grew into,</v>

2166
01:27:29.361 --> 01:27:33.740
<v Speaker 1>then I found out about writing and like</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a writer's guild and you know</v>

2167
01:27:34.010 --> 01:27:35.030
<v Speaker 1>all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

2168
01:27:35.060 --> 01:27:36.380
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll do it.</v>

2169
01:27:36.381 --> 01:27:38.120
<v Speaker 1>I like to see what it's about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why not?</v>

2170
01:27:38.750 --> 01:27:42.080
<v Speaker 1>But I didn't get a writer's job until</v>
<v Speaker 1>years later,</v>

2171
01:27:42.710 --> 01:27:45.200
<v Speaker 1>but I had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had went through a bad breakup here</v>

2172
01:27:45.201 --> 01:27:46.880
<v Speaker 1>and I wanted to go to New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what,</v>

2173
01:27:46.881 --> 01:27:48.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm breaking it to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to change zip code.</v>

2174
01:27:50.010 --> 01:27:52.190
<v Speaker 1>So I tried to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was so naive.</v>

2175
01:27:52.240 --> 01:27:53.300
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna write on Conan.</v>

2176
01:27:53.301 --> 01:27:55.610
<v Speaker 1>So I started like sending,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because this is when he was in New York.</v>

2177
01:27:56.300 --> 01:27:58.760
<v Speaker 1>I didn't hear anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ended up having to be here for like</v>

2178
01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:02.630
<v Speaker 1>another two years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then after I gave up that dream of</v>

2179
01:28:02.631 --> 01:28:05.300
<v Speaker 1>wanting to just get a writing job in New</v>
<v Speaker 1>York so I could live in New York,</v>

2180
01:28:05.510 --> 01:28:07.970
<v Speaker 1>I ended up getting a writing job in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stanford,</v>

2181
01:28:07.971 --> 01:28:08.804
<v Speaker 1>Connecticut.</v>

2182
01:28:09.260 --> 01:28:11.870
<v Speaker 1>And I took it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was my first writer's guild job,</v>

2183
01:28:11.900 --> 01:28:15.800
<v Speaker 1>but I moved to Harlem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I will work on set all day and</v>

2184
01:28:15.801 --> 01:28:19.040
<v Speaker 1>then race down to the cellar and perform</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the cellar.</v>

2185
01:28:19.070 --> 01:28:23.300
<v Speaker 1>So wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was living a life that I always wanted</v>

2186
01:28:23.301 --> 01:28:26.420
<v Speaker 1>to do at 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was afraid to move to New York,</v>

2187
01:28:26.660 --> 01:28:29.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at 20 cause I didn't think I could</v>

2188
01:28:29.331 --> 01:28:31.610
<v Speaker 1>afford it for some reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

2189
01:28:31.611 --> 01:28:33.830
<v Speaker 1>so I lived in Chicago and then I moved</v>
<v Speaker 1>to La.</v>

2190
01:28:33.860 --> 01:28:36.440
<v Speaker 1>For some reason I felt like I could do</v>
<v Speaker 1>those towns.</v>

2191
01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:40.190
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I was living in Harlem when I was a</v>

2192

<v Speaker 1>it's from,</v>

2324
01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:26.700
<v Speaker 1>because there was a Viacom's spot from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 10 national commercials that I did</v>

2325
01:34:26.701 --> 01:34:28.560
<v Speaker 1>called me and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

2326
01:34:28.561 --> 01:34:31.580
<v Speaker 1>we got some bad news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was an in house legal dispute and</v>

2327
01:34:31.590 --> 01:34:34.290
<v Speaker 1>fire kind of between your spots and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>spots called thumb wars.</v>

2328
01:34:34.740 --> 01:34:37.830
<v Speaker 1>And so we're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's ED already so we're not going to</v>

2329
01:34:37.831 --> 01:34:39.490
<v Speaker 1>be airing your spots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

2330
01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:42.780
<v Speaker 1>we already,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we already edited a fuse,</v>

2331
01:34:42.790 --> 01:34:44.410
<v Speaker 1>we'll send them to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

2332
01:34:44.520 --> 01:34:46.800
<v Speaker 1>So I had like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just had the session fee.</v>

2333
01:34:47.820 --> 01:34:51.630
<v Speaker 1>So the commercial money I was banking on</v>
<v Speaker 1>and nothing be,</v>

2334
01:34:51.631 --> 01:34:54.390
<v Speaker 1>so I went from thinking I was going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least have,</v>

2335
01:34:54.480 --> 01:34:56.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super bowls,</v>

2336
01:34:56.041 --> 01:34:57.740
<v Speaker 1>10 national spots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2337
01:34:57.770 --> 01:35:00.380
<v Speaker 1>And doing a superbowl ad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That time when commercials actually</v>

2338
01:35:00.381 --> 01:35:04.820
<v Speaker 1>paid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was counting pre counting money and</v>

2339
01:35:04.821 --> 01:35:06.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought I was going to lead to make a</v>

2340
01:35:06.680 --> 01:35:07.610
<v Speaker 1>quarter of a million that year at least.</v>

2341
01:35:07.760 --> 01:35:08.540
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2342
01:35:08.540 --> 01:35:11.750
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then I ended up sleeping on my</v>

2343
01:35:11.751 --> 01:35:14.330
<v Speaker 1>boys air mattress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a preacher moss.</v>

2344
01:35:14.420 --> 01:35:16.640
<v Speaker 1>Shout out to preach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever think about calling them</v>

2345
01:35:16.641 --> 01:35:18.080
<v Speaker 1>back with the Radio Gig?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2346
01:35:18.350 --> 01:35:19.280
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2347
01:35:19.310 --> 01:35:20.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm no good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never.</v>

2348
01:35:20.541 --> 01:35:21.261
<v Speaker 1>I never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2349
01:35:21.261 --> 01:35:22.340
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2350
01:35:22.600 --> 01:35:24.230
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to be a local,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

2351
01:35:24.280 --> 01:35:25.790
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my reasoning was if you're offering me a</v>

2352
01:35:25.791 --> 01:35:28.670
<v Speaker 1>radio Gig at 26,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can get a radio gig at 56.</v>

2353
01:35:28.820 --> 01:35:30.260
<v Speaker 1>It's a voice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

2354
01:35:30.590 --> 01:35:35.090
<v Speaker 1>That was my thinking at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my 26 year old thinking and then,</v>

2355
01:35:35.091 --> 01:35:37.190
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so no,</v>

2356
01:35:37.250 --> 01:35:38.570
<v Speaker 1>cause I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to go back.</v>

2357
01:35:38.630 --> 01:35:43.630
<v Speaker 1>I felt like I had done everything I</v>
<v Speaker 1>could do in Chicago because like,</v>

2358
01:35:44.630 --> 01:35:47.150
<v Speaker 1>when shows were coming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would get like a coaster on it.</v>

2359
01:35:47.151 --> 01:35:49.970
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want dude's that tried to make it out</v>

2360
01:35:49.971 --> 01:35:51.060
<v Speaker 1>of like those local mark.</v>

2361
01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:52.750
<v Speaker 1>Like remember man cow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2362
01:35:52.820 --> 01:35:54.590
<v Speaker 1>In the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get mad cow in the morning.</v>

2363
01:35:54.591 --> 01:35:55.940
<v Speaker 1>He was a Chicago Guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't he?</v>

2364
01:35:55.941 --> 01:35:56.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2365
01:35:56.720 --> 01:35:58.670
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then him and Howard stern of the</v>

2366
01:35:58.671 --> 01:36:01.060
<v Speaker 1>crazy beef went after him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2367
01:36:01.070 --> 01:36:02.780
<v Speaker 1>Howard stern lapped him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2368
01:36:03.260 --> 01:36:08.000
<v Speaker 1>He was like a guy who was like a Chicago</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy that was sort of bleeding out into</v>

2369
01:36:08.001 --> 01:36:09.950
<v Speaker 1>other markets and then it all went away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

2370
01:36:10.010 --> 01:36:10.580
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

2371
01:36:10.580 --> 01:36:13.790
<v Speaker 1>So when I came out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was sleeping on an air mattress,</v>

2372
01:36:13.820 --> 01:36:18.820
<v Speaker 1>got some pussy on it strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was consensual and sex on an air</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's like almost like futon sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fantastic.</v>

2376
01:36:24.450 --> 01:36:25.460
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

2377
01:36:25.461 --> 01:36:26.810
<v Speaker 1>I told her I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was funny,</v>

2378
01:36:26.811 --> 01:36:28.570
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is like a poor man's waterbed and he's</v>

2379
01:36:28.571 --> 01:36:29.430

2380
01:36:30.020 --> 01:36:31.280

<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

2381
01:36:31.281 --> 01:36:32.750
<v Speaker 1>I was there for 18 months,</v>

01:36:40.340 --> 01:36:41.960
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah man.</v>

2385
01:36:41.961 --> 01:36:42.890
<v Speaker 1>But it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was great.</v>

2386
01:36:42.891 --> 01:36:44.210
<v Speaker 1>It was a great time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2387
01:36:44.211 --> 01:36:48.140
<v Speaker 1>To just really like learn the art form</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a different level and then just see</v>

2388
01:36:48.141 --> 01:36:50.690
<v Speaker 1>who's out here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I didn't fuck with the store.</v>

2389
01:36:50.691 --> 01:36:52.270
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would drive past it and not,</v>

2390
01:36:52.310 --> 01:36:55.460
<v Speaker 1>I was doing the Improv,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2391
01:36:55.550 --> 01:37:00.290
<v Speaker 1>once every two months and like just like</v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee houses and stuff.</v>

2392
01:37:00.320 --> 01:37:02.990
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2393
01:37:03.080 --> 01:37:06.410
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't until I was when everybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>hates Chris and Chris Rock was doing,</v>

2394
01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:10.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that special way he performed in South</v>

2395
01:37:10.340 --> 01:37:12.200
<v Speaker 1>Africa and he was working on that and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>just said,</v>

2396
01:37:12.480 --> 01:37:14.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to the store tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2397
01:37:15.110 --> 01:37:16.700
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to come see it in.</v>

2398
01:37:16.790 --> 01:37:18.110
<v Speaker 1>I just come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2399
01:37:18.111 --> 01:37:21.200
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I sat in the Olr and I watched Chris</v>

2400
01:37:21.201 --> 01:37:23.650
<v Speaker 1>go up and at that time I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't in,</v>

2401
01:37:23.660 --> 01:37:27.050
<v Speaker 1>I've still not at the laugh factory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I did the Improv and I would do the</v>

2402
01:37:27.051 --> 01:37:28.910
<v Speaker 1>laugh factory on like chocolate Sundays</v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatever.</v>

2403
01:37:29.540 --> 01:37:33.020
<v Speaker 1>But the Improv,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it felt like you had to have your set</v>

2404
01:37:33.021 --> 01:37:35.540
<v Speaker 1>already worked out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you couldn't fuck around,</v>

2405
01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:39.080
<v Speaker 1>couldn't fuck around the or and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't really go outside the box of</v>

2406
01:37:39.081 --> 01:37:44.030
<v Speaker 1>what a comedian is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when I was at the store,</v>

2407
01:37:44.060 --> 01:37:47.180
<v Speaker 1>I saw a few comments go up before Chris</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>

2408
01:37:47.210 --> 01:37:48.860
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can be an artist here.</v>

2409
01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:54.160
<v Speaker 1>Like that was my first instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you can do whatever you think is</v>

2410
01:37:54.291 --> 01:37:56.640
<v Speaker 1>your thing here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I saw Chris go up and I was</v>

2411
01:37:56.641 --> 01:37:57.630
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to get in here.</v>

2412
01:37:57.631 --> 01:37:59.400
<v Speaker 1>Like it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2413
01:37:59.401 --> 01:38:01.020
<v Speaker 1>I got whatever I got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to do it.</v>

2414
01:38:01.050 --> 01:38:02.190
<v Speaker 1>I got to get him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't around,</v>

2415
01:38:02.520 --> 01:38:05.340
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't around and I saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then check this out.</v>

2416
01:38:06.260 --> 01:38:09.390
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then I started coming down on Sunday</v>

2417
01:38:09.391 --> 01:38:14.391
<v Speaker 1>and Monday and Tommy was doing it at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time and I would listen to Tomi talk and</v>

2418
01:38:14.761 --> 01:38:15.060
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

2419
01:38:15.060 --> 01:38:20.060
<v Speaker 1>And what blew me away about Tommy was I</v>
<v Speaker 1>never met a person who ran a comedy club</v>

2420
01:38:21.900 --> 01:38:25.050
<v Speaker 1>who knew that much about comedians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And who was that passionate about</v>

2421
01:38:25.051 --> 01:38:26.040
<v Speaker 1>comedy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I didn't,</v>

2422
01:38:26.070 --> 01:38:27.690
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know him from anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

2423
01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:32.010
<v Speaker 1>I just never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the funny bones that I had to work,</v>

2424
01:38:32.070 --> 01:38:37.070
<v Speaker 1>nobody gave a fuck about the lineups and</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of like his process.</v>

2425
01:38:37.710 --> 01:38:39.990
<v Speaker 1>So I didn't mind him talking to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2426
01:38:39.991 --> 01:38:40.980
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy likes to talk.</v>

2427
01:38:40.981 --> 01:38:41.731
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit.</v>

2428
01:38:41.731 --> 01:38:43.200
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people probably don't talk to</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

2429
01:38:43.230 --> 01:38:45.150
<v Speaker 1>And so then when he would talk to me</v>
<v Speaker 1>about comedy,</v>

2430
01:38:45.420 --> 01:38:49.320
<v Speaker 1>I was blown away by the hits that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>knew a specific history of it.</v>

2431
01:38:49.321 --> 01:38:51.030
<v Speaker 1>And Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't get a chance to see him</v>

2432
01:38:51.031 --> 01:38:53.250
<v Speaker 1>emerge as a crazy fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He became,</v>

2433
01:38:53.251 --> 01:38:54.180
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2434
01:38:54.360 --> 01:38:55.440
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then,</v>

2435
01:38:55.650 --> 01:38:56.483
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2436
01:38:56.550 --> 01:38:58.710
<v Speaker 1>he would give me two minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the two minute spots,</v>

2437
01:38:58.711 --> 01:39:00.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's two minute spots and I would do too</v>

2438
01:39:00.241 --> 01:39:00.750
<v Speaker 1>many things.</v>

2439
01:39:00.750 --> 01:39:02.250
<v Speaker 1>And then he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

2440
01:39:02.270 --> 01:39:04.230
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to give you 10 minutes.</v>

2441
01:39:04.231 --> 01:39:05.320
<v Speaker 1>And then he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2442
01:39:06.450 --> 01:39:09.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna give you a showcase for Mitzi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he would call me.</v>

2443
01:39:09.720 --> 01:39:11.340
<v Speaker 1>It's going down now and I would drive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get all,</v>

2444
01:39:11.341 --> 01:39:13.490
<v Speaker 1>it just is not happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll go back home because the,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm bad with that.</v>

2448
01:39:21.510 --> 01:39:25.110
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the class that I was in with visible</v>

2465
01:39:58.771 --> 01:40:02.340
<v Speaker 1>when I was a road comic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to,</v>

2466
01:40:02.430 --> 01:40:06.750
<v Speaker 1>like Dave stroop used to book me in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Columbus and Columbus and he used to pay</v>

<v Speaker 1>me at four feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trekkies pay me well,</v>

2468
01:40:08.491 --> 01:40:13.491
<v Speaker 1>and then he would code feature me Cole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he just stopped bugging me.</v>

2469

<v Speaker 1>on to me.</v>

<v Speaker 1>that's cool.</v>

2536
01:42:42.970 --> 01:42:45.580
<v Speaker 1>But we were away from the club,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's up?</v>

2537
01:42:46.420 --> 01:42:48.400
<v Speaker 1>And then she made,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to come back to the condo.</v>

2538
01:42:48.401 --> 01:42:50.410
<v Speaker 1>It was like a weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was so goofy.</v>

2539
01:42:50.411 --> 01:42:50.981
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

2540
01:42:50.981 --> 01:42:51.940
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>

2541
01:42:51.941 --> 01:42:52.774
<v Speaker 1>we fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

2542
01:42:53.820 --> 01:42:55.540
<v Speaker 1>but it was literally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2543
01:42:55.570 --> 01:42:59.140
<v Speaker 1>I was no game want me that she just</v>
<v Speaker 1>picked me.</v>

2544
01:42:59.141 --> 01:43:02.620
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't a lot of that weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like whoever she was mad at before,</v>

2545
01:43:02.621 --> 01:43:04.150
<v Speaker 1>she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this dude,</v>

2546
01:43:05.080 --> 01:43:07.770
<v Speaker 1>I want that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's really how that went down is</v>

2547
01:43:08.410 --> 01:43:12.430
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't a me thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

2548
01:43:12.431 --> 01:43:14.140
<v Speaker 1>Like that's a funny thing because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>digger,</v>

2549
01:43:14.141 --> 01:43:16.440
<v Speaker 1>you're kind of working together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2550
01:43:16.870 --> 01:43:19.630
<v Speaker 1>When people in bars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they always wind up hooking up.</v>

2551
01:43:20.010 --> 01:43:22.060
<v Speaker 1>Like that's like the constant thing in</v>
<v Speaker 1>bars,</v>

2552
01:43:22.061 --> 01:43:24.850
<v Speaker 1>bartenders and the waitresses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pj always doing that.</v>

2553
01:43:25.400 --> 01:43:27.130
<v Speaker 1>I really man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2554
01:43:27.670 --> 01:43:32.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say in my twenties I was more</v>

2555
01:43:32.231 --> 01:43:34.030
<v Speaker 1>like conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2556
01:43:34.031 --> 01:43:36.910
<v Speaker 1>I knew how to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could change my act to get an audience</v>

2557
01:43:36.911 --> 01:43:37.600
<v Speaker 1>member or whatever.</v>

2558
01:43:37.600 --> 01:43:38.171
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

2559
01:43:38.171 --> 01:43:39.830
<v Speaker 1>she's cute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me talk about this topic.</v>

2560
01:43:39.831 --> 01:43:41.080
<v Speaker 1>She'll come up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was so crazy,</v>

2561
01:43:41.081 --> 01:43:42.130
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I would know how to</v>

2562
01:43:43.660 --> 01:43:46.180
<v Speaker 1>do all that stuff or go to the mall and</v>
<v Speaker 1>invite somebody,</v>

2563
01:43:46.181 --> 01:43:47.570
<v Speaker 1>you know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2564
01:43:48.580 --> 01:43:53.540
<v Speaker 1>But then as I got older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I wasn't concentrating your</v>

2565
01:43:53.541 --> 01:43:54.500
<v Speaker 1>comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2566
01:43:54.501 --> 01:43:55.450
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at this date,</v>

2567
01:43:55.451 --> 01:43:58.130
<v Speaker 1>Sam was so valuable to me and I was just</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2568
01:43:58.131 --> 01:44:00.740
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to just,</v>

2569
01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:03.620
<v Speaker 1>and then I was trying to figure it out</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it was at that time,</v>

2570
01:44:03.860 --> 01:44:07.550
<v Speaker 1>like later on it was about DVD sales.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we hear Comedians,</v>

2571
01:44:07.551 --> 01:44:08.990
<v Speaker 1>I sell out every time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2572
01:44:09.050 --> 01:44:11.960
<v Speaker 1>I sell two dvds at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then I started going,</v>

2573
01:44:11.961 --> 01:44:13.550
<v Speaker 1>what am I not doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then I,</v>

2574
01:44:13.730 --> 01:44:16.910
<v Speaker 1>I would fix that and then it would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>like lines waiting for my DVD.</v>

2575
01:44:16.911 --> 01:44:18.740
<v Speaker 1>But I'm a horrible salesman.</v>

2576
01:44:18.920 --> 01:44:21.260
<v Speaker 1>So one person want to get in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation for a long time.</v>

2577
01:44:21.261 --> 01:44:24.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you just fucked up my line.</v>

2578
01:44:24.861 --> 01:44:26.300
<v Speaker 1>Like you talk too long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2579
01:44:26.301 --> 01:44:28.550
<v Speaker 1>So I had to learn how to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep it moving,</v>

2580
01:44:28.551 --> 01:44:29.660
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I,</v>

2581
01:44:29.661 --> 01:44:32.370
<v Speaker 1>then I didn't really like talking to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>audience that much afterwards,</v>

2582
01:44:32.371 --> 01:44:35.510
<v Speaker 1>something if I'm doing like racial stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it would always come back.</v>

2583
01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:38.150
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to do this joke about how,</v>

2584
01:44:38.830 --> 01:44:41.290
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2585
01:44:41.470 --> 01:44:42.730
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Busta rhymes,</v>

2586
01:44:42.731 --> 01:44:44.320
<v Speaker 1>I went to a buster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ron's concert and he,</v>

2587
01:44:44.321 --> 01:44:46.930
<v Speaker 1>he uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was all white and he had an real</v>

2588
01:44:46.931 --> 01:44:49.450
<v Speaker 1>niggas make some noise and everybody was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2589
01:44:49.480 --> 01:44:50.920
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the punchline,</v>

2590
01:44:50.921 --> 01:44:53.450
<v Speaker 1>it's like white people are niggas now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

2591
01:44:53.470 --> 01:44:56.050
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh did I say and not only can we call</v>

2592
01:44:56.051 --> 01:44:59.600

<v Speaker 1>they are paying $85 for the privilege to</v>

2593
01:44:59.601 --> 01:45:00.470
<v Speaker 1>be called native.</v>

2594
01:45:00.470 --> 01:45:01.303
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2595
01:45:01.670 --> 01:45:03.140
<v Speaker 1>so then my job would be like white</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

2596
01:45:03.141 --> 01:45:08.141
<v Speaker 1>I call you Nigga for $10,000 Nigga cell</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nigga clearance cash only.</v>

2597
01:45:08.630 --> 01:45:11.360
<v Speaker 1>Cause I know how you niggas and all like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was like a joke I would do on the</v>

2598
01:45:11.361 --> 01:45:15.380
<v Speaker 1>road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I would be out selling my DVD</v>

2599
01:45:16.060 --> 01:45:17.720
<v Speaker 1>and always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2600
01:45:18.130 --> 01:45:20.770
<v Speaker 1>a drug white person will come up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>give me $20 ago,</v>

2602
01:45:25.401 --> 01:45:26.770
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

2603
01:45:26.830 --> 01:45:28.060
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a problem.</v>

2604
01:45:28.061 --> 01:45:30.070
<v Speaker 1>When you get forbid and words for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitten words,</v>

2605
01:45:30.071 --> 01:45:32.590
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't wait to blurt them out.</v>

2606
01:45:32.890 --> 01:45:34.180
<v Speaker 1>Can't wait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we used to,</v>

2607
01:45:34.181 --> 01:45:36.190
<v Speaker 1>we used to joke like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if that was my thing.</v>

2608
01:45:36.230 --> 01:45:39.310
<v Speaker 1>Like what if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if I didn't sell product?</v>

2609
01:45:39.311 --> 01:45:41.290
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>y'all could just call me Nigga at the</v>

2610
01:45:41.291 --> 01:45:46.291
<v Speaker 1>back for $20 and like just shake up the</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole t shirt DVD selling thing.</v>

2611
01:45:46.390 --> 01:45:49.060
<v Speaker 1>Like who is this guy letting white</v>
<v Speaker 1>people calling me,</v>

2612
01:45:49.080 --> 01:45:50.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>

2613
01:45:50.561 --> 01:45:52.440
<v Speaker 1>it would it be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got it got so,</v>

2614
01:45:53.640 --> 01:45:55.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that growth process.</v>

2615
01:45:55.190 --> 01:45:56.210
<v Speaker 1>Every comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every,</v>

2616
01:45:56.300 --> 01:45:58.160
<v Speaker 1>every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think minority comedian wants to</v>

2617
01:45:58.161 --> 01:46:02.870
<v Speaker 1>figure out race like in their twenties</v>
<v Speaker 1>and early thirties they want to fix it</v>

2618
01:46:02.871 --> 01:46:05.420
<v Speaker 1>or have some clever angle to no one's</v>
<v Speaker 1>done before.</v>

2619
01:46:05.690 --> 01:46:07.970
<v Speaker 1>But the reaction to that is you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do.</v>

2620
01:46:07.971 --> 01:46:11.930
<v Speaker 1>And I'll give you work in Kentucky at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the late show Friday and you're here,</v>

2621
01:46:11.931 --> 01:46:14.330
<v Speaker 1>you come talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2622
01:46:14.420 --> 01:46:17.150
<v Speaker 1>a black man invented the golf tee</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he was tired of holding the</v>

2623
01:46:17.151 --> 01:46:17.941
<v Speaker 1>ball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they're like,</v>

2624
01:46:17.941 --> 01:46:18.950
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

2625
01:46:18.951 --> 01:46:22.970
<v Speaker 1>It's like a different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to figuring it out,</v>

2626
01:46:23.030 --> 01:46:25.250
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so now it's funny when I hear like</v>

2627
01:46:25.251 --> 01:46:27.080
<v Speaker 1>younger comics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2628
01:46:27.110 --> 01:46:31.010
<v Speaker 1>attack and race and in that familiar</v>
<v Speaker 1>place it's like,</v>

2629
01:46:31.460 --> 01:46:32.870
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's cool.</v>

2630
01:46:32.930 --> 01:46:34.120
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's like,</v>

2631
01:46:34.130 --> 01:46:35.840
<v Speaker 1>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's beyond that,</v>

2632
01:46:35.841 --> 01:46:38.160
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's also like you're dealing with</v>

2633
01:46:38.161 --> 01:46:40.740
<v Speaker 1>talking to the audience and the problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>with talking to the audiences,</v>

2634
01:46:41.010 --> 01:46:44.820
<v Speaker 1>you might run into seven people that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>really cool and great to talk to you</v>

2635
01:46:44.821 --> 01:46:45.121
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2636
01:46:45.121 --> 01:46:48.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad I met you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you run into two drunk morons</v>

2637
01:46:48.690 --> 01:46:49.980
<v Speaker 1>that your entire night</v>

2638
01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:52.110
<v Speaker 2>and then you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't even believe I have to talk to</v>

2639
01:46:52.111 --> 01:46:52.710
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2640
01:46:52.710 --> 01:46:54.660
<v Speaker 2>And I'm stuck talking to you and your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2641
01:46:54.810 --> 01:46:59.250
<v Speaker 2>the problem is you think you can make</v>
<v Speaker 2>fun of why people and why people can't</v>

2642
01:46:59.251 --> 01:47:02.940
<v Speaker 2>say the n word to you like you think you</v>
<v Speaker 2>think that's okay.</v>

2643
01:47:02.941 --> 01:47:06.190
<v Speaker 2>You could say it to us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We count cheese compensation,</v>

2644
01:47:06.260 --> 01:47:08.070
<v Speaker 2>which is draining.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't do this.</v>

2645
01:47:08.100 --> 01:47:09.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like when you did,</v>

2646
01:47:09.170 --> 01:47:11.080
<v Speaker 2>you can't pick who your meeting after</v>
<v Speaker 2>those shows,</v>

2647
01:47:11.910 --> 01:47:13.500
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're trying to sell</v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

2648
01:47:14.150 --> 01:47:16.280
<v Speaker 1>So that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't want to have to sell</v>

2649
01:47:16.281 --> 01:47:18.020

<v Speaker 1>quick hits and I figured out what my ask</v>

2680
01:48:28.161 --> 01:48:30.670
<v Speaker 1>was for the college market and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>finally,</v>

2681
01:48:30.671 --> 01:48:33.730
<v Speaker 1>my agents would never put me in Naca</v>
<v Speaker 1>nationals.</v>

2682
01:48:33.731 --> 01:48:36.820
<v Speaker 1>They would always do Naca regionals and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Naca is the National Association of</v>

2683
01:48:36.821 --> 01:48:39.400
<v Speaker 1>campus activities where you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2688
01:48:43.151 --> 01:48:45.410

<v Speaker 1>but I knew I,</v>

2689
01:48:45.480 --> 01:48:48.090
<v Speaker 1>and I never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I rarely or never got selected to</v>

2690
01:48:48.110 --> 01:48:53.110
<v Speaker 1>regional because my humor works best if</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

2691
01:48:53.830 --> 01:48:56.920
<v Speaker 1>if everybody can see it at that time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when I was talking about,</v>

2692

2772
01:52:24.670 --> 01:52:26.140

<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not paying you.</v>

2778
01:52:38.710 --> 01:52:41.800
<v Speaker 1>capture this in my whole purpose was to</v>
<v Speaker 1>resell it as you didn't listen to him.</v>

2779
01:52:42.040 --> 01:52:43.870
<v Speaker 1>It was this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause he had only done music.</v>

2780
01:52:43.871 --> 01:52:44.920
<v Speaker 1>He hadn't done comedy.</v>

<v Speaker 2>if I found that they did come the</v>

2785
01:52:55.910 --> 01:52:57.440
<v Speaker 2>specials and I would pick their brain on</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2786
01:52:57.441 --> 01:52:58.060
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You had to do anything for 10 years.</v>

2792
01:53:10.490 --> 01:53:12.710
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people that aren't very</v>
<v Speaker 2>famous that have netflix specials though</v>

2804
01:53:40.780 --> 01:53:42.890
<v Speaker 2>that could be argued.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That could definitely be arguing and so</v>

2811
01:53:54.370 --> 01:53:56.090
<v Speaker 2>how much that costs to shoot it all with</v>
<v Speaker 2>iphone,</v>

2812
01:53:57.070 --> 01:54:01.210
<v Speaker 2>it cost me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I paid an editor,</v>

2813
01:54:01.300 --> 01:54:02.133
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

2814
01:54:03.410 --> 01:54:05.420
<v Speaker 1>if I didn't pay him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would've cost me</v>

2815
01:54:07.130 --> 01:54:09.140
<v Speaker 1>less than a thousand dollars.</v>

2816
01:54:09.230 --> 01:54:13.040
<v Speaker 2>That's a great deal with the editor</v>
<v Speaker 2>calls me in the bargain.</v>

2817
01:54:13.520 --> 01:54:16.940

<v Speaker 2>Do you remember when Dave towl did</v>

2818
01:54:16.941 --> 01:54:20.470
<v Speaker 2>something where he gave the audience</v>
<v Speaker 2>cameras them film him?</v>
