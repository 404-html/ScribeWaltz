1
00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.211
<v Speaker 1>Try My day,</v>

2
00:00:01.211 --> 00:00:03.870
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.</v>

3
00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:04.711
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4
00:00:04.711 --> 00:00:08.220
<v Speaker 1>that brings up this the thing that's going on this week with Conor McGregor.</v>

5
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.770
<v Speaker 1>We got caught off guard last episode.</v>

6
00:00:10.771 --> 00:00:13.830
<v Speaker 1>Jamie and I were talking and just out of nowhere,</v>

7
00:00:13.831 --> 00:00:14.760
<v Speaker 1>it's just breaking news.</v>

8
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:15.930
<v Speaker 1>And Jamie brought it up.</v>

9
00:00:15.931 --> 00:00:17.670
<v Speaker 1>The Conor announced his retirement and I said,</v>

10
00:00:17.671 --> 00:00:18.570
<v Speaker 1>I thought he was trolling you.</v>

11
00:00:18.571 --> 00:00:20.010
<v Speaker 1>And I had the exact same reaction.</v>

12
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:20.701
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

13
00:00:20.701 --> 00:00:21.210
<v Speaker 1>he's trolling,</v>

14
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.043
<v Speaker 1>he's fucking around.</v>

15
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.221
<v Speaker 1>It's all weird.</v>

16
00:00:23.221 --> 00:00:23.491
<v Speaker 1>He wouldn't,</v>

17
00:00:23.491 --> 00:00:26.280
<v Speaker 1>he'd be more eloquent than that.</v>

18
00:00:26.281 --> 00:00:26.700
<v Speaker 1>He'd be,</v>

19
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:27.450
<v Speaker 1>he blew it up,</v>

20
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:28.740
<v Speaker 1>put it out better than that.</v>

21
00:00:28.741 --> 00:00:28.891
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

22
00:00:28.891 --> 00:00:31.500
<v Speaker 1>and then the news started coming out and I also started thinking,</v>

23
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:31.681
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

24
00:00:31.681 --> 00:00:32.700
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>

25
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.200
<v Speaker 1>maybe something happened in training or maybe it was because of that guy that</v>

26
00:00:37.201 --> 00:00:39.930
<v Speaker 1>died recently and people were saying,</v>

27
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

28
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.070
<v Speaker 1>they were shocked that I didn't know the full details and the guy's death.</v>

29
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.233
<v Speaker 1>Honestly,</v>

30
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:46.860
<v Speaker 1>with things like this,</v>

31
00:00:46.861 --> 00:00:49.490
<v Speaker 1>like you know what's going to happen and um,</v>

32
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.700
<v Speaker 1>it's unavoidable.</v>

33
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:51.090
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

34
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.090
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain amount of risk involved in any extreme sport.</v>

35
00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.570
<v Speaker 1>Plus that's the exception.</v>

36
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.433
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

37
00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:58.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

38
00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:59.250
<v Speaker 1>It's going to happen.</v>

39
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.750
<v Speaker 1>That's the exception.</v>

40
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.750
<v Speaker 1>It is like seeing mad at peanut butter when someone dies.</v>

41
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.091
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

42
00:01:03.091 --> 00:01:03.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm still gonna eat peanut,</v>

43
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:04.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

44
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.041
<v Speaker 1>it is exception,</v>

45
00:01:05.041 --> 00:01:06.690
<v Speaker 1>but I was waiting for all the details come out.</v>

46
00:01:06.691 --> 00:01:08.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they've done an autopsy yet.</v>

47
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.270
<v Speaker 1>They don't think they know.</v>

48
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.553
<v Speaker 1>I don't either.</v>

49
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.090
<v Speaker 1>I and I,</v>

50
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.930
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think that with Connor and I don't know if this is,</v>

51
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's sharing too much information.</v>

52
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.170
<v Speaker 1>When Khan and I had lunch together,</v>

53
00:01:19.171 --> 00:01:22.260
<v Speaker 1>I just talked to and he kept bringing up is a reoccurring theme when we were</v>

54
00:01:22.261 --> 00:01:22.711
<v Speaker 1>talking,</v>

55
00:01:22.711 --> 00:01:23.130
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

56
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.180
<v Speaker 1>the the media man,</v>

57
00:01:24.181 --> 00:01:24.781
<v Speaker 1>like for this,</v>

58
00:01:24.781 --> 00:01:26.010
<v Speaker 1>it's such a beast.</v>

59
00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.460
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

60
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.690
<v Speaker 1>like I've done interviews before,</v>

61
00:01:27.691 --> 00:01:28.501
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

62
00:01:28.501 --> 00:01:29.041
<v Speaker 1>it's different.</v>

63
00:01:29.041 --> 00:01:33.150
<v Speaker 1>Like he's not a guy where when any other fighter sit down and do an interview,</v>

64
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.180
<v Speaker 1>they're really not selling the fight the time about their camp and they're doing</v>

65
00:01:36.181 --> 00:01:39.210
<v Speaker 1>the same thing over and over and Connor's up fucking master that we've never</v>

66
00:01:39.211 --> 00:01:40.290
<v Speaker 1>seen do it before.</v>

67
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.020
<v Speaker 1>So he's coming up with original content nonstop.</v>

68
00:01:43.021 --> 00:01:43.710
<v Speaker 1>He's on.</v>

69
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.981
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

70
00:01:43.981 --> 00:01:44.814
<v Speaker 1>like when,</v>

71
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.200
<v Speaker 1>when he came on our podcasts,</v>

72
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.861
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

73
00:01:46.861 --> 00:01:47.160
<v Speaker 1>you could,</v>

74
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.760
<v Speaker 1>he was on,</v>

75
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.350
<v Speaker 1>he did the whole car wash.</v>

76
00:01:49.351 --> 00:01:51.300
<v Speaker 1>He was exhausted and then we came down.</v>

77
00:01:51.301 --> 00:01:54.480
<v Speaker 1>You could tell him he was thinking and just start spitting out gold.</v>

78
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:55.620
<v Speaker 1>He's just a beast man.</v>

79
00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.670
<v Speaker 1>So to have that guy fly around the world and do all this shit,</v>

80
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean at the end of the day we got to remember this is a sport,</v>

81
00:02:03.181 --> 00:02:04.500
<v Speaker 1>this is not the WWE.</v>

82
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.900
<v Speaker 1>So to keep putting on the spectacle,</v>

83
00:02:06.901 --> 00:02:09.410
<v Speaker 1>like it's similar to WWE at some point yesterday,</v>

84
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:09.990
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

85
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.150
<v Speaker 1>what these guys do is it's a real,</v>

86
00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.740
<v Speaker 1>real,</v>

87
00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:13.710
<v Speaker 1>we're in the HERP business.</v>

88
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.270
<v Speaker 1>He has to focus man.</v>

89
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.500
<v Speaker 1>And I just feel like,</v>

90
00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.450
<v Speaker 1>I think Connor's to blame,</v>

91
00:02:18.451 --> 00:02:19.710
<v Speaker 1>to Dana's to blame.</v>

92
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.580
<v Speaker 1>I think both of them just need to talk because if Connor before it's bad</v>

93
00:02:23.581 --> 00:02:24.990
<v Speaker 1>planning him bad playing on Dana,</v>

94
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.980
<v Speaker 1>if he just went do,</v>

95
00:02:25.981 --> 00:02:26.814
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

96
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.260
<v Speaker 1>I've sold this flight more than anyone.</v>

97
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.680
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

98
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.520
<v Speaker 1>this is nuts.</v>

99
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:30.210
<v Speaker 1>I have to,</v>

100
00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.410
<v Speaker 1>if I lose this next fight,</v>

101
00:02:31.411 --> 00:02:32.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm screwed though.</v>

102
00:02:32.341 --> 00:02:33.900
<v Speaker 1>A problem is it sets a precedent.</v>

103
00:02:33.901 --> 00:02:34.320
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

104
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.640
<v Speaker 1>if I'm looking at it from a,</v>

105
00:02:35.641 --> 00:02:36.600
<v Speaker 1>as a businessman,</v>

106
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.710
<v Speaker 1>if I was,</v>

107
00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:38.610
<v Speaker 1>if I was a businessman,</v>

108
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.380
<v Speaker 1>let's pretend,</v>

109
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.910
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

110
00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.520
<v Speaker 1>I would say this sets a precedent.</v>

111
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.220
<v Speaker 1>You can't let someone decide what press they don't press.</v>

112
00:02:44.221 --> 00:02:49.020
<v Speaker 1>They don't do like you have an obligation to fulfill certain responsibilities</v>

113
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.030
<v Speaker 1>like with the media for sure.</v>

114
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.390
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

115
00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.260
<v Speaker 1>like create hype.</v>

116
00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.370
<v Speaker 1>But the question is,</v>

117
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.430
<v Speaker 1>but the question is like when do those responsibilities move into like a purely</v>

118
00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.210
<v Speaker 1>digital realm and when do those responsibilities only in showing up places,</v>

119
00:03:04.211 --> 00:03:05.470
<v Speaker 1>physically old school,</v>

120
00:03:05.471 --> 00:03:06.940
<v Speaker 1>retro going places.</v>

121
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.840
<v Speaker 1>Because like there's nothing wrong with the occasional press conference,</v>

122
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:11.340
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

123
00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.760
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

124
00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:12.070
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

125
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.390
<v Speaker 1>but also you can accomplish way more with a few fucking viral videos than you</v>

126
00:03:16.391 --> 00:03:16.811
<v Speaker 1>ever could.</v>

127
00:03:16.811 --> 00:03:21.370
<v Speaker 1>Going to some weird interview with two people that aren't MMA fans.</v>

128
00:03:21.371 --> 00:03:23.290
<v Speaker 1>And I think he made a really good point about that.</v>

129
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.270
<v Speaker 1>Doing this fucking these morning shows,</v>

130
00:03:25.271 --> 00:03:27.490
<v Speaker 1>they make them go do where you know,</v>

131
00:03:27.491 --> 00:03:29.170
<v Speaker 1>nobody knows who the guy is or the girl,</v>

132
00:03:29.171 --> 00:03:30.670
<v Speaker 1>they don't give a shit about MNA.</v>

133
00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.211
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

134
00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:31.600
<v Speaker 1>they don't,</v>

135
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.280
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to talk to him the way you want to talk to him.</v>

136
00:03:33.281 --> 00:03:34.330
<v Speaker 1>Or I want to talk to him,</v>

137
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.961
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

138
00:03:34.961 --> 00:03:37.030
<v Speaker 1>and I'm talking to Connor like before a fight.</v>

139
00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

140
00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to find out what's going on in the head of a guy who's going to</v>

141
00:03:41.981 --> 00:03:42.551
<v Speaker 1>engage.</v>

142
00:03:42.551 --> 00:03:44.920
<v Speaker 1>One of the most exciting things that I'm going to see all year.</v>

143
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:45.101
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

144
00:03:45.101 --> 00:03:46.330
<v Speaker 1>you're not going on a morning show going.</v>

145
00:03:46.331 --> 00:03:47.470
<v Speaker 1>How about that cauliflower?</v>

146
00:03:47.471 --> 00:03:47.710
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

147
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:48.371
<v Speaker 1>How'd you get that?</v>

148
00:03:48.371 --> 00:03:49.300
<v Speaker 1>Shut the fuck up.</v>

149
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.060
<v Speaker 1>But also like that.</v>

150
00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.431
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

151
00:03:51.431 --> 00:03:54.750
<v Speaker 1>but congress is a guy where he's crossed over into pop culture.</v>

152
00:03:54.751 --> 00:03:55.960
<v Speaker 1>He's such a big star now.</v>

153
00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.950
<v Speaker 1>A tweet from him.</v>

154
00:03:56.951 --> 00:04:01.630
<v Speaker 1>We'll hype the fight if I guarantee if Connor Dana had conversation and Dan was</v>

155
00:04:01.631 --> 00:04:01.751
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

156
00:04:01.751 --> 00:04:02.141
<v Speaker 1>all right man,</v>

157
00:04:02.141 --> 00:04:04.810
<v Speaker 1>I understand it's a big fight cause you got to remember if you were to lose this</v>

158
00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:05.170
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

159
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:06.370
<v Speaker 1>now you're losing your golden boy.</v>

160
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.650
<v Speaker 1>The biggest star by far by far.</v>

161
00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.290
<v Speaker 1>I also feel like he could just focus.</v>

162
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:12.940
<v Speaker 1>Let's just let him focus a little bit.</v>

163
00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.450
<v Speaker 1>Why I also feel like the magnitude of this,</v>

164
00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.440
<v Speaker 1>the dilemma that's in front of him and Nate Diaz is also very apparent.</v>

165
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:21.970
<v Speaker 1>This is not a guy you can half ass.</v>

166
00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.850
<v Speaker 1>And even if you are 100% ready,</v>

167
00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.580
<v Speaker 1>you've never even fought him at 100% Oh,</v>

168
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.140
<v Speaker 1>you fought him when he had 11 days.</v>

169
00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.850
<v Speaker 1>Notice what he'd been drinking in Mexico.</v>

170
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean he posted typical matchup man.</v>

171
00:04:33.491 --> 00:04:35.140
<v Speaker 1>And then you want to fly him on a plane.</v>

172
00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:36.550
<v Speaker 1>Did anyone think?</v>

173
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:37.610
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

174
00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:38.210
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

175
00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.540
<v Speaker 1>If you're looking at them with three months away though,</v>

176
00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.650
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

177
00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.410
<v Speaker 1>but still Connor's exhausted man from doing this stuff.</v>

178
00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:45.303
<v Speaker 1>And also,</v>

179
00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:46.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

180
00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:47.200
<v Speaker 1>I see some fighters go,</v>

181
00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.350
<v Speaker 1>it's our obligation to do these press conferences slowly.</v>

182
00:04:50.351 --> 00:04:50.980
<v Speaker 1>Roll Homie,</v>

183
00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.110
<v Speaker 1>you're not Conor Mcgregor press conference.</v>

184
00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.880
<v Speaker 1>That's a big difference.</v>

185
00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.260
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

186
00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.840
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

187
00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:56.441
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

188
00:04:56.441 --> 00:04:57.310
<v Speaker 1>lost to him.</v>

189
00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.040
<v Speaker 1>You're talking millions and the UFC,</v>

190
00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:01.510
<v Speaker 1>if I'm looking at as a businessman,</v>

191
00:05:01.511 --> 00:05:01.790
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

192
00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:02.300
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

193
00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:03.130
<v Speaker 1>all right man.</v>

194
00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.430
<v Speaker 1>Hell,</v>

195
00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:04.450
<v Speaker 1>he's gonna do a press conference,</v>

196
00:05:04.451 --> 00:05:05.560
<v Speaker 1>but we're going to come to him.</v>

197
00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.000
<v Speaker 1>Did anyone think to do that?</v>

198
00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.990
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

199
00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.591
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

200
00:05:08.591 --> 00:05:11.410
<v Speaker 1>Connor is one of the most charismatic guys,</v>

201
00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.690
<v Speaker 1>seriously of all time in all sports.</v>

202
00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:14.560
<v Speaker 1>No doubt about it.</v>

203
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:15.041
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

204
00:05:15.041 --> 00:05:17.110
<v Speaker 1>he is a fucking marketing machine.</v>

205
00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.960
<v Speaker 1>Like they're just the quotes in his style,</v>

206
00:05:19.961 --> 00:05:21.490
<v Speaker 1>his tweet player interrupt you.</v>

207
00:05:21.491 --> 00:05:25.120
<v Speaker 1>But his tweet is the biggest tweet by an athlete this year.</v>

208
00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:29.020
<v Speaker 1>Beat Koby Bryant's retirement tweet and you want me to go do a fucking interview</v>

209
00:05:29.021 --> 00:05:29.860
<v Speaker 1>for ESPN?</v>

210
00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:30.071
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

211
00:05:30.071 --> 00:05:31.000
<v Speaker 1>they don't know the sport.</v>

212
00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.930
<v Speaker 1>Oh as well.</v>

213
00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.040
<v Speaker 1>I watch ESPN every morning.</v>

214
00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.500
<v Speaker 1>They were talking about Lebron James The playoff game tonight.</v>

215
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.150
<v Speaker 1>They interrupted this shit with breaking news top out.</v>

216
00:05:38.151 --> 00:05:39.190
<v Speaker 1>Connor's not retiring.</v>

217
00:05:39.191 --> 00:05:40.810
<v Speaker 1>That's how big he is now.</v>

218
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.690
<v Speaker 1>The PR team at UFC could not get this.</v>

219
00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.910
<v Speaker 1>They could not get this sort of attention.</v>

220
00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:46.661
<v Speaker 1>Even if they want to.</v>

221
00:05:46.661 --> 00:05:47.494
<v Speaker 1>Connor can.</v>

222
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:48.540
<v Speaker 1>It's a different age,</v>

223
00:05:48.541 --> 00:05:49.150
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

224
00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:50.020
<v Speaker 1>Those old interviews,</v>

225
00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:51.190
<v Speaker 1>that else press conference.</v>

226
00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:55.510
<v Speaker 1>You have a legit fucking superstar man who makes more money than anyone.</v>

227
00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:56.590
<v Speaker 1>The ice skates.</v>

228
00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:57.380
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>

229
00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:58.210
<v Speaker 1>What I was going to say,</v>

230
00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:58.520
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

231
00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:59.353
<v Speaker 1>Series points.</v>

232
00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:02.740
<v Speaker 1>It's okay a sometimes I just go now where you know you,</v>

233
00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:03.050
<v Speaker 1>you have a,</v>

234
00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.620
<v Speaker 1>you have all good points are all valid points and I get this contracts,</v>

235
00:06:06.621 --> 00:06:07.371
<v Speaker 1>I get stuff like that,</v>

236
00:06:07.371 --> 00:06:10.160
<v Speaker 1>but there has to be where you can't have a pissing contest.</v>

237
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:10.701
<v Speaker 1>You can't say,</v>

238
00:06:10.701 --> 00:06:10.911
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

239
00:06:10.911 --> 00:06:13.130
<v Speaker 1>we're going to run it like a business this time and then not this time because</v>

240
00:06:13.131 --> 00:06:16.940
<v Speaker 1>it's good for the company with Conor Mcgregor and this big of a fight.</v>

241
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.560
<v Speaker 1>If he wins this dude,</v>

242
00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.270
<v Speaker 1>you know how much more money you're gonna make,</v>

243
00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:21.920
<v Speaker 1>not the fucking press conference.</v>

244
00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:25.160
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] you're absolutely right that he's one of the most charismatic guys</v>

245
00:06:25.161 --> 00:06:25.760
<v Speaker 1>were all time.</v>

246
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:30.380
<v Speaker 1>But Nate Diaz right now is God damn gigantic.</v>

247
00:06:30.381 --> 00:06:32.030
<v Speaker 1>And I think we're going to realize he's not as big.</v>

248
00:06:32.031 --> 00:06:32.691
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of close,</v>

249
00:06:32.691 --> 00:06:34.580
<v Speaker 1>but he's goddamn gigantic.</v>

250
00:06:34.581 --> 00:06:35.414
<v Speaker 1>He's huge.</v>

251
00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:36.590
<v Speaker 1>And see what happens.</v>

252
00:06:36.591 --> 00:06:37.640
<v Speaker 1>That's because of that.</v>

253
00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:39.050
<v Speaker 1>That's part of that fight.</v>

254
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:44.230
<v Speaker 1>Part of that fight is that Connor is also fighting another mercurial superstar</v>

255
00:06:44.811 --> 00:06:45.380
<v Speaker 1>character.</v>

256
00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:45.860
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

257
00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:47.810
<v Speaker 1>Especially now after the first fight.</v>

258
00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:48.411
<v Speaker 1>I agree Joe,</v>

259
00:06:48.411 --> 00:06:50.780
<v Speaker 1>but let's say Connor doesn't fight at UFC 200.</v>

260
00:06:50.781 --> 00:06:51.140
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

261
00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:51.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

262
00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:54.410
<v Speaker 1>let's say Nate fights Woodley or Robbie Lawler.</v>

263
00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.830
<v Speaker 1>Let me know how this rating scale and we know even pray fight at one 70 animals.</v>

264
00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:59.750
<v Speaker 1>Let's say at one 55,</v>

265
00:06:59.751 --> 00:07:00.450
<v Speaker 1>let's say fights.</v>

266
00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:02.090
<v Speaker 1>Dos Anjos let me know how those ratings,</v>

267
00:07:02.091 --> 00:07:04.100
<v Speaker 1>because here's where it won't be as close.</v>

268
00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:04.310
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

269
00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:05.690
<v Speaker 1>we need to be a quarter of it.</v>

270
00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:07.670
<v Speaker 1>I wonder.</v>

271
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:08.270
<v Speaker 1>It'd be close.</v>

272
00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:09.103
<v Speaker 1>Maybe half.</v>

273
00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:09.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

274
00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:12.530
<v Speaker 1>that's the sense that maybe half half makes sense,</v>

275
00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.300
<v Speaker 1>but half would still be pretty spectacular,</v>

276
00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:14.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

277
00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:14.951
<v Speaker 1>at night,</v>

278
00:07:14.951 --> 00:07:15.470
<v Speaker 1>even half.</v>

279
00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:15.770
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

280
00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:18.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm being generous and he's the biggest,</v>

281
00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:19.310
<v Speaker 1>there's no doubt about it.</v>

282
00:07:19.311 --> 00:07:20.144
<v Speaker 1>He's the Vegas.</v>

283
00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:21.681
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

284
00:07:21.681 --> 00:07:22.461
<v Speaker 1>Well who knows?</v>

285
00:07:22.461 --> 00:07:23.390
<v Speaker 1>It's all speculation.</v>

286
00:07:23.391 --> 00:07:24.350
<v Speaker 1>But here's what's interesting.</v>

287
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.840
<v Speaker 1>They offered the fight apparently to normal go Madoff,</v>

288
00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:29.780
<v Speaker 1>but he can't take it because it's only four days after Ramadan.</v>

289
00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:31.473
<v Speaker 1>Fuck man.</v>

290
00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:33.380
<v Speaker 1>So he's very religious,</v>

291
00:07:33.381 --> 00:07:35.000
<v Speaker 1>so he does that whole fascinating.</v>

292
00:07:35.001 --> 00:07:35.781
<v Speaker 1>I had a buddy of mine,</v>

293
00:07:35.781 --> 00:07:38.510
<v Speaker 1>my friend Con clayly from back in Boston.</v>

294
00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:39.620
<v Speaker 1>He used to do that shit.</v>

295
00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:41.560
<v Speaker 1>He's training.</v>

296
00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:43.153
<v Speaker 1>He would do that.</v>

297
00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:43.640
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

298
00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:45.140
<v Speaker 1>he would fast when he was training,</v>

299
00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:46.341
<v Speaker 1>it was crazy.</v>

300
00:07:46.341 --> 00:07:47.174
<v Speaker 1>You just,</v>

301
00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:47.421
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

302
00:07:47.421 --> 00:07:50.680
<v Speaker 1>you have certain rules where you're not allowed to eat anything.</v>

303
00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:50.841
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

304
00:07:50.841 --> 00:07:51.321
<v Speaker 1>how's it go?</v>

305
00:07:51.321 --> 00:07:53.350
<v Speaker 1>You're not allowed to eat anything or drink anything up.</v>

306
00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:53.810
<v Speaker 1>Sun Down.</v>

307
00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:54.310
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

308
00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:55.110
<v Speaker 1>It upside down.</v>

309
00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:55.390
<v Speaker 1>Do you see?</v>

310
00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:55.670
<v Speaker 1>Do it?</v>

311
00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:55.791
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

312
00:07:55.791 --> 00:07:56.270
<v Speaker 1>And you can't,</v>

313
00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:57.530
<v Speaker 1>there's no food or water.</v>

314
00:07:58.290 --> 00:07:59.810
<v Speaker 1>And at like 6:00 PM,</v>

315
00:07:59.811 --> 00:08:00.644
<v Speaker 1>they have this feast.</v>

316
00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:01.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

317
00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:01.580
<v Speaker 1>But it,</v>

318
00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:03.680
<v Speaker 1>it can weaken you and so he'd be upset.</v>

319
00:08:03.681 --> 00:08:04.251
<v Speaker 1>It would have a real,</v>

320
00:08:04.251 --> 00:08:05.630
<v Speaker 1>it'd be a real problem if you had a fight.</v>

321
00:08:05.631 --> 00:08:06.740
<v Speaker 1>Four or five rounds.</v>

322
00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.600
<v Speaker 1>I get it and I would love to see that fight.</v>

323
00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:09.290
<v Speaker 1>Habib,</v>

324
00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:10.700
<v Speaker 1>Nigga Murdoch Verse Nate Diaz.</v>

325
00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:13.280
<v Speaker 1>He's such a beast,</v>

326
00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:13.640
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

327
00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:14.450
<v Speaker 1>He's phenomenal.</v>

328
00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:15.283
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

329
00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:18.020
<v Speaker 1>To us who are balls deep in the UFC world.</v>

330
00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:18.560
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

331
00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:18.831
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

332
00:08:18.831 --> 00:08:19.230
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

333
00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:20.660
<v Speaker 1>Espn and covering that fight.</v>

334
00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:20.961
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

335
00:08:20.961 --> 00:08:22.130
<v Speaker 1>you should start a promotion.</v>

336
00:08:22.131 --> 00:08:22.461
<v Speaker 1>Look at you.</v>

337
00:08:22.461 --> 00:08:23.480
<v Speaker 1>You're a God damn promoter.</v>

338
00:08:23.481 --> 00:08:24.314
<v Speaker 1>You know how to do this.</v>

339
00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:25.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>

340
00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:27.830
<v Speaker 1>I've been through it and when I see a guy like Conor comes in once in a</v>

341
00:08:27.831 --> 00:08:28.311
<v Speaker 1>lifetime,</v>

342
00:08:28.311 --> 00:08:29.840
<v Speaker 1>if you think there'd be another condom at Gregor,</v>

343
00:08:29.841 --> 00:08:30.950
<v Speaker 1>you're bat shit crazy.</v>

344
00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:32.870
<v Speaker 1>I think when we invest in arts,</v>

345
00:08:32.871 --> 00:08:33.201
<v Speaker 1>the UFC,</v>

346
00:08:33.201 --> 00:08:33.741
<v Speaker 1>they keep going.</v>

347
00:08:33.741 --> 00:08:34.520
<v Speaker 1>I think you're crazy.</v>

348
00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:37.880
<v Speaker 1>I think Conor is a special dude and I think there's a few other,</v>

349
00:08:37.881 --> 00:08:38.930
<v Speaker 1>I think Brock Lesnar was,</v>

350
00:08:38.931 --> 00:08:39.651
<v Speaker 1>I think Rhonda is,</v>

351
00:08:39.651 --> 00:08:39.950
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

352
00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:41.210
<v Speaker 1>there's very few players.</v>

353
00:08:41.211 --> 00:08:46.211
<v Speaker 1>Is it possible that this is a calculated gamble based on not thinking he has</v>

354
00:08:47.391 --> 00:08:49.010
<v Speaker 1>enough time to prepare for Nate?</v>

355
00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:49.850
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

356
00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:54.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't think some possible impulses just just as just a matter of digging your</v>

357
00:08:54.561 --> 00:08:56.760
<v Speaker 1>heels into the ground and saying,</v>

358
00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:57.930
<v Speaker 1>there's no,</v>

359
00:08:57.990 --> 00:08:59.880
<v Speaker 1>there's no way I can do this much percent.</v>

360
00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:00.661
<v Speaker 1>I think he's just like,</v>

361
00:09:00.661 --> 00:09:00.811
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

362
00:09:00.811 --> 00:09:01.491
<v Speaker 1>I'm exhausted.</v>

363
00:09:01.491 --> 00:09:02.700
<v Speaker 1>You and me on this world tour is it?</v>

364
00:09:02.701 --> 00:09:03.900
<v Speaker 1>Can I please get ready for this?</v>

365
00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.430
<v Speaker 1>It's not the WWE man.</v>

366
00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:06.780
<v Speaker 1>Go,</v>

367
00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:07.111
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

368
00:09:07.111 --> 00:09:07.411
<v Speaker 1>ask,</v>

369
00:09:07.411 --> 00:09:11.940
<v Speaker 1>go ask a major superstar Lebron and I know you think it's not the same,</v>

370
00:09:11.941 --> 00:09:12.930
<v Speaker 1>but Lebron,</v>

371
00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:13.920
<v Speaker 1>any of these guys,</v>

372
00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:16.410
<v Speaker 1>these superstars in Sports Ranalda gone.</v>

373
00:09:16.411 --> 00:09:18.150
<v Speaker 1>These world tours not get paid.</v>

374
00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:21.900
<v Speaker 1>Sell the fight when like put my social media will cover way more than this.</v>

375
00:09:21.901 --> 00:09:22.920
<v Speaker 1>Go Fuck Yourself.</v>

376
00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:24.630
<v Speaker 1>But we have no one fighting like he,</v>

377
00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:25.800
<v Speaker 1>he can't say anything.</v>

378
00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:26.521
<v Speaker 1>You say anything.</v>

379
00:09:26.521 --> 00:09:26.701
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

380
00:09:26.701 --> 00:09:27.660
<v Speaker 1>you got pulled from the car.</v>

381
00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:32.840
<v Speaker 1>So more is not better is a certain amount of a certain amount you do.</v>

382
00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:34.590
<v Speaker 1>We had a certain amount.</v>

383
00:09:34.591 --> 00:09:35.580
<v Speaker 1>You're doing it for the UFC.</v>

384
00:09:35.581 --> 00:09:37.320
<v Speaker 1>You're not doing it for the Conor McGregor brand.</v>

385
00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:38.610
<v Speaker 1>You're not doing for the fighters brand.</v>

386
00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:39.960
<v Speaker 1>You think by him going to ESPN,</v>

387
00:09:39.961 --> 00:09:41.820
<v Speaker 1>he's going get more followers.</v>

388
00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:45.690
<v Speaker 1>Would you think that there's like there's certain consideration that looked like</v>

389
00:09:45.691 --> 00:09:49.530
<v Speaker 1>it looks good to have file of fighters show up on ESPN.</v>

390
00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:50.400
<v Speaker 1>He's been there,</v>

391
00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:50.820
<v Speaker 1>he's on,</v>

392
00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:51.960
<v Speaker 1>he's on breaking news.</v>

393
00:09:51.961 --> 00:09:52.151
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

394
00:09:52.151 --> 00:09:52.360
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

395
00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:52.680
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

396
00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:54.630
<v Speaker 1>he's been doing it maybe the week before,</v>

397
00:09:54.631 --> 00:09:55.380
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

398
00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:58.470
<v Speaker 1>But when he wants to prepare for a camp and you have a guy of his magnitude</v>

399
00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:00.330
<v Speaker 1>coming off a loss and he's like,</v>

400
00:10:00.331 --> 00:10:00.930
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

401
00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:04.230
<v Speaker 1>I really think doing all this press and all this stuff has fucked with my</v>

402
00:10:04.231 --> 00:10:05.220
<v Speaker 1>capabilities to be a fight.</v>

403
00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:06.120
<v Speaker 1>I need to get back to that.</v>

404
00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.620
<v Speaker 1>Will you please let me focus?</v>

405
00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:08.461
<v Speaker 1>It makes it very hype.</v>

406
00:10:08.461 --> 00:10:09.270
<v Speaker 1>The fight.</v>

407
00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:10.103
<v Speaker 1>It totally makes sense.</v>

408
00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:11.520
<v Speaker 1>Well you can't have exceptions.</v>

409
00:10:11.521 --> 00:10:11.730
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

410
00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:12.421
<v Speaker 1>no mother fucker.</v>

411
00:10:12.421 --> 00:10:14.310
<v Speaker 1>You can cause you do make exceptions.</v>

412
00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:14.700
<v Speaker 1>Well here's what,</v>

413
00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:17.640
<v Speaker 1>you have certain people in the UFC roster where they can't,</v>

414
00:10:17.641 --> 00:10:18.151
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>

415
00:10:18.151 --> 00:10:20.070
<v Speaker 1>Where they pick and choose when they fight or who they fight.</v>

416
00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:21.000
<v Speaker 1>There are exceptions.</v>

417
00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:21.600
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

418
00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.460
<v Speaker 1>And here's another thing to Kate and take into consideration.</v>

419
00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.560
<v Speaker 1>One of the most important things that anybody,</v>

420
00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:28.740
<v Speaker 1>any athlete does while they're in training is get proper rest.</v>

421
00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:32.970
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the most important things and what fucks up when you go traveling</v>

422
00:10:32.971 --> 00:10:33.630
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>

423
00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:34.463
<v Speaker 1>Your rest.</v>

424
00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:35.860
<v Speaker 1>So number one thing that wrecks you,</v>

425
00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:36.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

426
00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:37.780
<v Speaker 1>let me think how much you travel too.</v>

427
00:10:37.781 --> 00:10:38.310
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

428
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:39.900
<v Speaker 1>I just flew in from Seattle this morning.</v>

429
00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:41.520
<v Speaker 1>I got up at five this morning,</v>

430
00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:42.630
<v Speaker 1>flew here,</v>

431
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:44.880
<v Speaker 1>got right off the plane and drove right in here.</v>

432
00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:45.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

433
00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:45.870
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

434
00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:46.800
<v Speaker 1>that's what happens man.</v>

435
00:10:46.801 --> 00:10:46.951
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

436
00:10:46.951 --> 00:10:48.060
<v Speaker 1>your body gets a,</v>

437
00:10:48.061 --> 00:10:49.770
<v Speaker 1>your immune system gets jack from that.</v>

438
00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:50.340
<v Speaker 1>It's all good.</v>

439
00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:51.173
<v Speaker 1>I just think of the,</v>

440
00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:52.850
<v Speaker 1>I think this is great for the sport,</v>

441
00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.410
<v Speaker 1>a good discussion to have because now future superstars will say,</v>

442
00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:56.191
<v Speaker 1>I'm only doing this,</v>

443
00:10:56.191 --> 00:10:57.024
<v Speaker 1>may interviews this,</v>

444
00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.200
<v Speaker 1>this much before the fight.</v>

445
00:10:58.380 --> 00:10:59.690
<v Speaker 1>Well maybe when all of the sink going to happen.</v>

446
00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:00.600
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's a debate.</v>

447
00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:03.960
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the debate could be held as to like what is the,</v>

448
00:11:03.961 --> 00:11:07.260
<v Speaker 1>what's the amount that you need to do once the amount that you should do,</v>

449
00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:08.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

450
00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:08.940
<v Speaker 1>like what,</v>

451
00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:11.040
<v Speaker 1>how do you have it set up and what would be the,</v>

452
00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:14.160
<v Speaker 1>what would be the best way for the performance of the athlete,</v>

453
00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:16.170
<v Speaker 1>the consideration of their,</v>

454
00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:17.011
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

455
00:11:17.011 --> 00:11:17.641
<v Speaker 1>their time.</v>

456
00:11:17.641 --> 00:11:22.080
<v Speaker 1>And focus to put 100% effort into something and not leave anything on the table</v>

457
00:11:22.081 --> 00:11:25.830
<v Speaker 1>because they really weren't rested enough cause we were or distracted too much.</v>

458
00:11:25.831 --> 00:11:26.940
<v Speaker 1>Cause they're doing too much press.</v>

459
00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:27.570
<v Speaker 1>But who is it?</v>

460
00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:28.560
<v Speaker 1>Who's it helping the end?</v>

461
00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:31.320
<v Speaker 1>The UFC and Dana white light by using paper view.</v>

462
00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:33.890
<v Speaker 1>If they have pay per view buys and they get a percentage of the buys,</v>

463
00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:34.813
<v Speaker 1>it helps.</v>

464
00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:35.671
<v Speaker 1>It helps everyone.</v>

465
00:11:35.671 --> 00:11:36.030
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

466
00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:36.990
<v Speaker 1>but if the fighter,</v>

467
00:11:36.991 --> 00:11:38.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean there should be a direct,</v>

468
00:11:38.131 --> 00:11:41.250
<v Speaker 1>there's a direct if a fighter as a percentage of pay per view with which guy</v>

469
00:11:41.251 --> 00:11:42.020
<v Speaker 1>like Conor does.</v>

470
00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:42.450
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

471
00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:46.770
<v Speaker 1>The more paper view deals where maybe he does it a title fight.</v>

472
00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:48.540
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what his deal is.</v>

473
00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:50.430
<v Speaker 1>So I'm talking about the pantry you buys for sure.</v>

474
00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:51.211
<v Speaker 1>I would have smacked her.</v>

475
00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:51.380
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

476
00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:52.230
<v Speaker 1>I would assume yes.</v>

477
00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:53.050
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

478
00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:55.300
<v Speaker 1>but so the more press he does,</v>

479
00:11:55.301 --> 00:11:57.370
<v Speaker 1>the more things get sold,</v>

480
00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:59.020
<v Speaker 1>the more money he makes.</v>

481
00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:01.480
<v Speaker 1>But in his point of view,</v>

482
00:12:01.481 --> 00:12:05.860
<v Speaker 1>like tweets and things that he's doing right now are getting more attention to</v>

483
00:12:05.861 --> 00:12:08.560
<v Speaker 1>it than any of these stupid interview going to pay for this kind of,</v>

484
00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:09.394
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>

485
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:10.570
<v Speaker 1>and you can't argue with that.</v>

486
00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:11.560
<v Speaker 1>That's absolutely true,</v>

487
00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:12.940
<v Speaker 1>but the question is like,</v>

488
00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:14.433
<v Speaker 1>where were,</v>

489
00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:20.050
<v Speaker 1>you know there should be like a contract and the contract should state from x to</v>

490
00:12:20.051 --> 00:12:20.680
<v Speaker 1>y.</v>

491
00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:20.951
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

492
00:12:20.951 --> 00:12:22.240
<v Speaker 1>pick a date and time.</v>

493
00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:24.610
<v Speaker 1>I would be left alone if you saw it or wants to get me.</v>

494
00:12:24.611 --> 00:12:28.090
<v Speaker 1>I'll be up in Iceland freezing my deck off thrown sidekicks,</v>

495
00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:29.140
<v Speaker 1>come get me.</v>

496
00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:29.710
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>

497
00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:32.830
<v Speaker 1>I think this whole thing is a misspeak miscommunication.</v>

498
00:12:32.831 --> 00:12:35.650
<v Speaker 1>I see Dana side and I see countersigned right as a fight.</v>

499
00:12:35.651 --> 00:12:36.670
<v Speaker 1>I definitely see Connor side.</v>

500
00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:37.990
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just a miscommunication.</v>

501
00:12:37.991 --> 00:12:39.670
<v Speaker 1>I think if before all this came out,</v>

502
00:12:39.671 --> 00:12:40.211
<v Speaker 1>if Conner was like,</v>

503
00:12:40.211 --> 00:12:40.661
<v Speaker 1>listen man,</v>

504
00:12:40.661 --> 00:12:41.570
<v Speaker 1>I can't be doing all this fucking,</v>

505
00:12:41.571 --> 00:12:43.030
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you have Dana was sitting right.</v>

506
00:12:43.031 --> 00:12:44.920
<v Speaker 1>There would be no miscommunication.</v>

507
00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:45.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't think.</v>

508
00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:48.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he would agree that it was a miscue communication.</v>

509
00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:53.290
<v Speaker 1>I think he would say the Connor just does want to do the press and I got to do</v>

510
00:12:53.291 --> 00:12:54.070
<v Speaker 1>the press.</v>

511
00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:55.660
<v Speaker 1>And to me that's a miscommunication.</v>

512
00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:57.110
<v Speaker 1>But can I get some miscommunications,</v>

513
00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:57.963
<v Speaker 1>a disagreement?</v>

514
00:12:58.030 --> 00:12:58.301
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

515
00:12:58.301 --> 00:12:59.800
<v Speaker 1>I disagree because I eat,</v>

516
00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:00.760
<v Speaker 1>I disagree.</v>

517
00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:01.690
<v Speaker 1>And this is why Joe,</v>

518
00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:03.040
<v Speaker 1>because I think after,</v>

519
00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:03.943
<v Speaker 1>after,</v>

520
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.200
<v Speaker 1>even though we fought Aldo,</v>

521
00:13:05.201 --> 00:13:06.130
<v Speaker 1>he expressed,</v>

522
00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:07.510
<v Speaker 1>do I need to chill on these interviews?</v>

523
00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:08.650
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

524
00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:12.400
<v Speaker 1>he beats a Nate Diaz or he loses Nate Diaz again.</v>

525
00:13:12.401 --> 00:13:12.641
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

526
00:13:12.641 --> 00:13:12.821
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

527
00:13:12.821 --> 00:13:14.200
<v Speaker 1>this fucking press is killing me.</v>

528
00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:15.580
<v Speaker 1>So He's been voice in it.</v>

529
00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:19.030
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know if his camp has had the discussion with Dana,</v>

530
00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:21.340
<v Speaker 1>but at some point maybe they haven't.</v>

531
00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:21.930
<v Speaker 1>We don't know.</v>

532
00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:23.350
<v Speaker 1>Maybe his total speculation,</v>

533
00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:26.200
<v Speaker 1>miscommunication down and come up with a schedule.</v>

534
00:13:26.201 --> 00:13:28.600
<v Speaker 1>I guess you got to leave me alone for eight weeks.</v>

535
00:13:28.601 --> 00:13:28.930
<v Speaker 1>But he,</v>

536
00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:29.800
<v Speaker 1>but what if,</v>

537
00:13:29.801 --> 00:13:32.800
<v Speaker 1>what if Dana and Connor had a conversation right now,</v>

538
00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:34.900
<v Speaker 1>man to man and Cognito's listen,</v>

539
00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:35.763
<v Speaker 1>what I'll do,</v>

540
00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:37.240
<v Speaker 1>I'll film videos every day.</v>

541
00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:39.760
<v Speaker 1>I'll do this after my practices.</v>

542
00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:41.890
<v Speaker 1>I'll put all this social media out for you guys.</v>

543
00:13:41.891 --> 00:13:42.161
<v Speaker 1>Craig,</v>

544
00:13:42.161 --> 00:13:42.730
<v Speaker 1>this fight,</v>

545
00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:44.500
<v Speaker 1>no one has the pull that I do,</v>

546
00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:44.771
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

547
00:13:44.771 --> 00:13:47.590
<v Speaker 1>And I can create this many views for millions and millions.</v>

548
00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:48.700
<v Speaker 1>No other fighter can,</v>

549
00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:49.780
<v Speaker 1>don't pay me for it.</v>

550
00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:50.980
<v Speaker 1>Just don't make me travel.</v>

551
00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.440
<v Speaker 1>You don't think Dana and the UFC would agree to any of this?</v>

552
00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:54.270
<v Speaker 1>I bet.</v>

553
00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:55.420
<v Speaker 1>I bet they'd be open to it.</v>

554
00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:55.901
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

555
00:13:55.901 --> 00:13:56.734
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting,</v>

556
00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:57.550
<v Speaker 1>Kevin Hart,</v>

557
00:13:57.550 --> 00:13:59.230
<v Speaker 1>he was like one of the biggest stars in the world,</v>

558
00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:00.281
<v Speaker 1>one of the biggest,</v>

559
00:14:00.281 --> 00:14:01.114
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

560
00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:04.570
<v Speaker 1>comedians ever as far as like sales and volume,</v>

561
00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:05.080
<v Speaker 1>like 90,</v>

562
00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:05.980
<v Speaker 1>no one even close.</v>

563
00:14:05.981 --> 00:14:06.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

564
00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:06.321
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

565
00:14:06.321 --> 00:14:07.210
<v Speaker 1>he crushes it.</v>

566
00:14:07.211 --> 00:14:07.721
<v Speaker 1>He sells out.</v>

567
00:14:07.721 --> 00:14:08.380
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

568
00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:11.650
<v Speaker 1>what is that like 50,000 plus soldier field?</v>

569
00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:12.543
<v Speaker 1>It's nuts.</v>

570
00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:13.100
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

571
00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:13.930
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

572
00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:14.621
<v Speaker 1>that's not important.</v>

573
00:14:14.621 --> 00:14:16.630
<v Speaker 1>What's important is he's,</v>

574
00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:20.200
<v Speaker 1>he's like gigantic on social media,</v>

575
00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:21.220
<v Speaker 1>super active,</v>

576
00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:22.840
<v Speaker 1>and he does it all himself.</v>

577
00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:24.340
<v Speaker 1>So if he does a movie,</v>

578
00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:26.440
<v Speaker 1>like he'll do a movie and they'll say,</v>

579
00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:27.041
<v Speaker 1>oh great,</v>

580
00:14:27.041 --> 00:14:28.270
<v Speaker 1>and you can use your,</v>

581
00:14:28.271 --> 00:14:28.601
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

582
00:14:28.601 --> 00:14:33.130
<v Speaker 1>5.8 million social media followers and a,</v>

583
00:14:33.131 --> 00:14:34.180
<v Speaker 1>it'll boost up the movie.</v>

584
00:14:34.181 --> 00:14:34.601
<v Speaker 1>And it was like,</v>

585
00:14:34.601 --> 00:14:34.751
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

586
00:14:34.751 --> 00:14:34.921
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

587
00:14:34.921 --> 00:14:35.111
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>

588
00:14:35.111 --> 00:14:35.321
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

589
00:14:35.321 --> 00:14:35.980
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

590
00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:36.813
<v Speaker 1>That's mine.</v>

591
00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:37.840
<v Speaker 1>That's mine.</v>

592
00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:37.931
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

593
00:14:37.931 --> 00:14:38.800
<v Speaker 1>if you want that.</v>

594
00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:39.120
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

595
00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:42.230
<v Speaker 1>And we've got to talk about that first guy to dude.</v>

596
00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:46.120
<v Speaker 1>They like all the people that were in those movie meetings must have been like,</v>

597
00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:47.470
<v Speaker 1>oh shit.</v>

598
00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:48.370
<v Speaker 1>Because then the rock goes,</v>

599
00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:49.210
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

600
00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:49.541
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

601
00:14:49.541 --> 00:14:54.541
<v Speaker 1>Because there's a giant difference between a guy like the rock,</v>

602
00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:59.690
<v Speaker 1>like what he can do to sell a movie with social media and the average person,</v>

603
00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:00.950
<v Speaker 1>the average actor,</v>

604
00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:01.993
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's,</v>

605
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.350
<v Speaker 1>he's constantly on it.</v>

606
00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:07.490
<v Speaker 1>He has a dedicated loyal fan base because he's really funny and self deprecating</v>

607
00:15:07.491 --> 00:15:08.210
<v Speaker 1>follows us,</v>

608
00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:09.050
<v Speaker 1>works hard.</v>

609
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:10.000
<v Speaker 1>So he's shown pictures of,</v>

610
00:15:10.001 --> 00:15:10.791
<v Speaker 1>of the alarm clock.</v>

611
00:15:10.791 --> 00:15:14.210
<v Speaker 1>It says like four 15 in the morning and he's up there fucking doing dead lifts.</v>

612
00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:15.193
<v Speaker 1>He's an animal,</v>

613
00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:15.920
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

614
00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:17.510
<v Speaker 1>So a guy like that,</v>

615
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:19.130
<v Speaker 1>that's a business on the side,</v>

616
00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:19.993
<v Speaker 1>that's his,</v>

617
00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:20.511
<v Speaker 1>that's his,</v>

618
00:15:20.511 --> 00:15:25.511
<v Speaker 1>like he's got a hype business as well as a business to promote himself,</v>

619
00:15:26.421 --> 00:15:27.920
<v Speaker 1>but he can also hype things.</v>

620
00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:28.701
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

621
00:15:28.701 --> 00:15:32.870
<v Speaker 1>he's not promotion once he give me some money when he does that,</v>

622
00:15:32.871 --> 00:15:34.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure he's got it worked.</v>

623
00:15:34.041 --> 00:15:34.910
<v Speaker 1>It was talking about it.</v>

624
00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:36.530
<v Speaker 1>And it's got to worked into movies now.</v>

625
00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:37.160
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>

626
00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:37.341
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

627
00:15:37.341 --> 00:15:40.880
<v Speaker 1>if you want a part of the Kevin Hart money machine that I put together,</v>

628
00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:42.950
<v Speaker 1>well you gotta give me something bitch.</v>

629
00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:44.210
<v Speaker 1>Like she kind of be any different.</v>

630
00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:45.350
<v Speaker 1>You're right,</v>

631
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:46.530
<v Speaker 1>you're right in that respect as,</v>

632
00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:46.901
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>

633
00:15:46.901 --> 00:15:49.850
<v Speaker 1>as a superstar now not every fiber can pull that card.</v>

634
00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:54.880
<v Speaker 1>You legitimately have to be able to sell out giant stadiums and be a superstar.</v>

635
00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:55.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

636
00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:56.510
<v Speaker 1>And he certainly can,</v>

637
00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:58.570
<v Speaker 1>especially if you give them the right match ups,</v>

638
00:15:58.850 --> 00:15:59.061
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

639
00:15:59.061 --> 00:16:03.650
<v Speaker 1>if you give Connor the right match up at one 45 like I think honestly,</v>

640
00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:07.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm excited about this Nate Diaz fight cause I like watching them fight.</v>

641
00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:09.210
<v Speaker 1>I like watching Nate Diaz fight.</v>

642
00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:09.531
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

643
00:16:09.531 --> 00:16:10.760
<v Speaker 1>and I love the attention he's getting,</v>

644
00:16:10.761 --> 00:16:11.510
<v Speaker 1>but if I was,</v>

645
00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:13.130
<v Speaker 1>if I was in Connor's camp,</v>

646
00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:16.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean I understand that he's obsessed and he wants to get right back at it.</v>

647
00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:20.060
<v Speaker 1>I would say go fight Frankie Edgar,</v>

648
00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:22.100
<v Speaker 1>go fight Max Holloway.</v>

649
00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:24.050
<v Speaker 1>Have a rematch of Max Holloway.</v>

650
00:16:24.051 --> 00:16:26.390
<v Speaker 1>That shit would be epic if Aldo,</v>

651
00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:27.920
<v Speaker 1>whoever Aldo does,</v>

652
00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:28.141
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

653
00:16:28.141 --> 00:16:29.470
<v Speaker 1>and they mix it all up a fight,</v>

654
00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:30.510
<v Speaker 1>a rematch with all dumb.</v>

655
00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:32.360
<v Speaker 1>All those been talking mad shit about him,</v>

656
00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:33.111
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

657
00:16:33.111 --> 00:16:36.920
<v Speaker 1>I think all go genuine and genuinely believes that he fucked up.</v>

658
00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:39.470
<v Speaker 1>And if he gets a hold of this dude this time he get punished them,</v>

659
00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:40.161
<v Speaker 1>which is awesome.</v>

660
00:16:40.161 --> 00:16:41.120
<v Speaker 1>Fight and awesome story.</v>

661
00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:42.580
<v Speaker 1>I want to see it.</v>

662
00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:45.260
<v Speaker 1>I want to see homeowners can't think those sites are still gonna be there if he</v>

663
00:16:45.261 --> 00:16:46.190
<v Speaker 1>leaves his Nate Diaz.</v>

664
00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:47.360
<v Speaker 1>I think it takes some of the,</v>

665
00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:48.283
<v Speaker 1>it takes a stock.</v>

666
00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:50.540
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the star power already got taken away.</v>

667
00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:51.470
<v Speaker 1>Too much of a risk.</v>

668
00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:53.720
<v Speaker 1>It's just way too much power got taken away.</v>

669
00:16:53.721 --> 00:16:54.560
<v Speaker 1>And that second fight,</v>

670
00:16:54.561 --> 00:16:55.490
<v Speaker 1>not 100%,</v>

671
00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:56.211
<v Speaker 1>not 100%,</v>

672
00:16:56.211 --> 00:16:57.170
<v Speaker 1>he's still the biggest draw,</v>

673
00:16:57.290 --> 00:16:58.123
<v Speaker 1>but he was,</v>

674
00:16:58.180 --> 00:16:58.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

675
00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:01.810
<v Speaker 1>an assassin before that fight on [inaudible].</v>

676
00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:04.130
<v Speaker 1>Whether there was something going on,</v>

677
00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:05.440
<v Speaker 1>like when he flatlined,</v>

678
00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:07.220
<v Speaker 1>although with one punch and then did it,</v>

679
00:17:07.221 --> 00:17:10.520
<v Speaker 1>like it was nothing and smiled and I was talking to him when the interview and</v>

680
00:17:10.521 --> 00:17:10.970
<v Speaker 1>he's just saying,</v>

681
00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:11.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

682
00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:12.133
<v Speaker 1>no power,</v>

683
00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:13.003
<v Speaker 1>no power,</v>

684
00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:13.341
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

685
00:17:13.341 --> 00:17:14.060
<v Speaker 1>just put it,</v>

686
00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:14.840
<v Speaker 1>put it right where it's the,</v>

687
00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:15.060
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>

688
00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:15.800
<v Speaker 1>anything like it.</v>

689
00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:15.981
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

690
00:17:15.981 --> 00:17:20.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean the way he gobbled up the pressure and the way he controlled the shit</v>

691
00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:20.570
<v Speaker 1>talking.</v>

692
00:17:20.570 --> 00:17:21.261
<v Speaker 1>This is the thing,</v>

693
00:17:21.261 --> 00:17:21.441
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

694
00:17:21.441 --> 00:17:21.670
<v Speaker 1>we've,</v>

695
00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:26.410
<v Speaker 1>we've never had a guy of his capabilities and his mass appeal go,</v>

696
00:17:26.411 --> 00:17:26.640
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

697
00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:27.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do this.</v>

698
00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:29.630
<v Speaker 1>Like everyone else has jumped through these hoops.</v>

699
00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:29.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

700
00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:31.070
<v Speaker 1>I want to fucking train,</v>

701
00:17:31.071 --> 00:17:31.281
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

702
00:17:31.281 --> 00:17:32.031
<v Speaker 1>This is ridiculous.</v>

703
00:17:32.031 --> 00:17:32.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm already big enough.</v>

704
00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:34.610
<v Speaker 1>We've never had a guy really do this.</v>

705
00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:37.970
<v Speaker 1>He's also a guy where I think if he wanted to,</v>

706
00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:39.860
<v Speaker 1>if he was involved with the UFC,</v>

707
00:17:39.861 --> 00:17:40.670
<v Speaker 1>let's say Dana,</v>

708
00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:41.540
<v Speaker 1>which would never happen.</v>

709
00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:42.081
<v Speaker 1>Cut Goes,</v>

710
00:17:42.081 --> 00:17:42.901
<v Speaker 1>go do what the fuck you.</v>

711
00:17:42.901 --> 00:17:43.221
<v Speaker 1>I'm sick.</v>

712
00:17:43.221 --> 00:17:44.054
<v Speaker 1>You go do what you want.</v>

713
00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:48.380
<v Speaker 1>He could sell out a giant arena in Dublin against Datta 5,000 every Saturday.</v>

714
00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:49.770
<v Speaker 1>That's how powerful he is.</v>

715
00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:52.230
<v Speaker 1>That's what I literally make and just make more and more money.</v>

716
00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:52.980
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

717
00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:56.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about that because I think part of the excitement about him was</v>

718
00:17:56.041 --> 00:17:57.540
<v Speaker 1>building up to that Aldo fight.</v>

719
00:17:57.750 --> 00:18:00.000
<v Speaker 1>That was part of the man who would be king.</v>

720
00:18:00.001 --> 00:18:03.930
<v Speaker 1>Story was that he was going to fight the longtime king and when he flat the</v>

721
00:18:03.931 --> 00:18:04.830
<v Speaker 1>longtime king,</v>

722
00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:08.550
<v Speaker 1>he reached this level of legendary popularity.</v>

723
00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:09.120
<v Speaker 1>There does that.</v>

724
00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:13.530
<v Speaker 1>It happens once in a hundred generations when it comes with fighters,</v>

725
00:18:13.531 --> 00:18:13.950
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

726
00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:14.630
<v Speaker 1>There's this,</v>

727
00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:15.630
<v Speaker 1>this is moment,</v>

728
00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:16.500
<v Speaker 1>this boom.</v>

729
00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:18.780
<v Speaker 1>How many guys reached that moment?</v>

730
00:18:18.781 --> 00:18:23.220
<v Speaker 1>Like when he flatlined Aldo with one punch and then it was 13 seconds of the</v>

731
00:18:23.221 --> 00:18:24.054
<v Speaker 1>whole world was like,</v>

732
00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:24.811
<v Speaker 1>he fucking did it.</v>

733
00:18:24.811 --> 00:18:25.820
<v Speaker 1>The answer is none did it?</v>

734
00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:26.251
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

735
00:18:26.251 --> 00:18:27.360
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking crazy.</v>

736
00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:27.631
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

737
00:18:27.631 --> 00:18:28.950
<v Speaker 1>that was epic.</v>

738
00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:34.250
<v Speaker 1>But the lustre gets taken off by the Nate Diaz fight and if he loses to Nate</v>

739
00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:34.560
<v Speaker 1>Diaz,</v>

740
00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:36.390
<v Speaker 1>he's got a very good point that,</v>

741
00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:37.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

742
00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:42.000
<v Speaker 1>he can't lose because he wasn't given the right amount of opportunity to present</v>

743
00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:42.601
<v Speaker 1>or to,</v>

744
00:18:42.601 --> 00:18:43.050
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

745
00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:45.040
<v Speaker 1>to prepare himself because he had to do all this press,</v>

746
00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:45.631
<v Speaker 1>like right now,</v>

747
00:18:45.631 --> 00:18:48.930
<v Speaker 1>the Conor McGregor fan base and guys hugging his nuts,</v>

748
00:18:48.931 --> 00:18:50.310
<v Speaker 1>which I might be one of them,</v>

749
00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:51.210
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>

750
00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:51.511
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

751
00:18:51.511 --> 00:18:51.841
<v Speaker 1>they're going,</v>

752
00:18:51.841 --> 00:18:52.590
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

753
00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:53.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

754
00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:56.040
<v Speaker 1>Nate Diaz is way bigger and he kind of caught him off guard.</v>

755
00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:56.251
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

756
00:18:56.251 --> 00:18:56.731
<v Speaker 1>all that good.</v>

757
00:18:56.731 --> 00:18:59.100
<v Speaker 1>And there's a little asterisk I guess if you're this Conor guy,</v>

758
00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:01.470
<v Speaker 1>well now if he loses again,</v>

759
00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:04.590
<v Speaker 1>there's no more excuses because the fuck there's no astrick.</v>

760
00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:06.690
<v Speaker 1>Nate had 11 I'm saying it.</v>

761
00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:07.470
<v Speaker 1>You could,</v>

762
00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:08.011
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>

763
00:19:08.011 --> 00:19:08.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying there is Nate.</v>

764
00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:12.330
<v Speaker 1>Straight up beat them with 11 days preparing sip and coronas on a boat and came</v>

765
00:19:12.331 --> 00:19:13.050
<v Speaker 1>and whooped his ass.</v>

766
00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:18.050
<v Speaker 1>I thought ne was going to beat him just by first of all the size and length and</v>

767
00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:20.070
<v Speaker 1>deceptive boxing skills.</v>

768
00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:21.540
<v Speaker 1>That's not what I thought.</v>

769
00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:22.200
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

770
00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:26.010
<v Speaker 1>this is going to be the first guy that Connor's ever fought that's been in wars</v>

771
00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:28.260
<v Speaker 1>with like a legends.</v>

772
00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:32.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's been in there with a lot of fucking super high level dude.</v>

773
00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:35.130
<v Speaker 1>He's a monster and like this is a big,</v>

774
00:19:35.131 --> 00:19:37.170
<v Speaker 1>big fight and this is not a fight you want to take.</v>

775
00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:39.060
<v Speaker 1>Even if he's not ready on 11 days notice,</v>

776
00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:42.660
<v Speaker 1>you got to get ready for this dude and his Jujitsu is off the chain.</v>

777
00:19:42.661 --> 00:19:42.991
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

778
00:19:42.991 --> 00:19:46.980
<v Speaker 1>His Jujitsu is at a super high level and she's bigger than comment.</v>

779
00:19:46.981 --> 00:19:50.250
<v Speaker 1>There couldn't be a worse match up bars with Andre Ward,</v>

780
00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:53.000
<v Speaker 1>world champion and Joe showing on a regular basis.</v>

781
00:19:53.001 --> 00:19:54.480
<v Speaker 1>I know him and his brother Nick.</v>

782
00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:56.100
<v Speaker 1>I know Gilbert Melendez,</v>

783
00:19:56.101 --> 00:19:56.934
<v Speaker 1>Jace Shield,</v>

784
00:19:56.970 --> 00:19:57.840
<v Speaker 1>no joke,</v>

785
00:19:58.020 --> 00:19:58.621

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:02.610
<v Speaker 1>Fuck with Adrian.</v>

791
00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:06.060
<v Speaker 1>But the guy who we're not talking about in all this is Nate Diaz.</v>

792
00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:09.150
<v Speaker 1>Cause even though if Nate Diaz and you guys can say whatever you want,</v>

793
00:20:09.151 --> 00:20:10.500
<v Speaker 1>you'll see 200 still going to be dope.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's all fun and Dandy for the the absolute fans.</v>

796
00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:14.970
<v Speaker 1>If there's no Connor,</v>

797
00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:16.380
<v Speaker 1>Nate doesn't make the same pay day.</v>

798
00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:17.730
<v Speaker 1>So he gets fucked man.</v>

801
00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:20.850
<v Speaker 1>the dues that Nate has paid.</v>

802
00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:23.850
<v Speaker 1>And remember the Diaz brothers were the first guys to go.</v>

803
00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:24.691
<v Speaker 1>Not Fuck that man.</v>

804
00:20:24.691 --> 00:20:25.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it should be done that way.</v>

805
00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:27.560
<v Speaker 1>And you got appreciate that man in a,</v>

806

00:20:31.651 --> 00:20:32.484
<v Speaker 1>This ain't right.</v>

811
00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:37.290
<v Speaker 1>Well they're also the first guys to put a ridiculous emphasis on extreme cardio.</v>

812
00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:38.513
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

813
00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:39.540
<v Speaker 1>And it shows in their style.</v>

814
00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:39.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

816
00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:45.300

817
00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:45.900
<v Speaker 1>it's funny,</v>

818
00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:48.640
<v Speaker 1>I keep quoting and nick corrected me the other day.</v>

819
00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:51.490
<v Speaker 1>I said that he swam back from Alcatraz twice.</v>

820
00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:53.100
<v Speaker 1>He just correct me the other day.</v>

821
00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:53.921
<v Speaker 1>It was five times.</v>

822
00:20:53.921 --> 00:20:55.150
<v Speaker 1>Now it's fucking nuts.</v>

823
00:20:55.151 --> 00:20:59.860
<v Speaker 1>Five times he swam from Alcatraz to the fucking mainland.</v>

824
00:20:59.861 --> 00:21:01.420
<v Speaker 1>They didn't think you could do that.</v>

825
00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:02.830
<v Speaker 1>They didn't think it was possible.</v>

826
00:21:02.831 --> 00:21:06.160
<v Speaker 1>That's why they put a prison there cause they didn't think people could swim.</v>

827
00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:10.090
<v Speaker 1>Well this mother fucker is a stoner and an athlete.</v>

828
00:21:10.091 --> 00:21:11.100
<v Speaker 1>These aren't even a prisoner.</v>

834
00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:23.230
<v Speaker 1>The only,</v>

835
00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:27.930
<v Speaker 1>the only guy who could bring Nate Diaz money is George Saint Pierre Grc parent.</v>

836
00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:28.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

843
00:21:38.981 --> 00:21:39.401
<v Speaker 1>he could do it.</v>

844
00:21:39.401 --> 00:21:40.180
<v Speaker 1>At the end of it,</v>

845

00:22:06.611 --> 00:22:06.821
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

869
00:22:06.821 --> 00:22:07.690
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

870
00:22:07.691 --> 00:22:08.141
<v Speaker 1>No Man,</v>

871
00:22:08.141 --> 00:22:09.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm George Saint Pierre.</v>

872
00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:13.660
<v Speaker 1>So he's saying either the USC has to make up for it in his purse or Reebok has</v>

873
00:22:13.661 --> 00:22:14.440
<v Speaker 1>make up for it.</v>

874
00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:15.730
<v Speaker 1>So I think it's a money thing right now.</v>

875
00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:16.593
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

876
00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:19.150
<v Speaker 1>That's what you hear is this inside scoop.</v>

877
00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:19.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

878
00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:20.140
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

879
00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:21.650
<v Speaker 1>We just scooped a shit out of this.</v>

880
00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:23.213
<v Speaker 1>That's what I hear.</v>

881
00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:24.160
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

882
00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:26.590
<v Speaker 1>I had been hearing rumblings of negotiations,</v>

883
00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:27.933
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

884
00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:28.661
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

885
00:22:28.661 --> 00:22:31.270
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those things you don't want to hope he wanted to just wait,</v>

886
00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:32.990
<v Speaker 1>but also I only got,</v>

887
00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:33.843
<v Speaker 1>you can save the code.</v>

888
00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:35.140
<v Speaker 1>Well he would,</v>

889
00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:36.970
<v Speaker 1>he would most certainly saved the card.</v>

890
00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:38.133
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

891
00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:38.780
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

892
00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:40.480
<v Speaker 1>it would be crazy.</v>

893
00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:42.470
<v Speaker 1>Would be him and,</v>

894
00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:43.303
<v Speaker 1>and Connor.</v>

895
00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:44.871
<v Speaker 1>I man,</v>

896
00:22:44.871 --> 00:22:45.800
<v Speaker 1>that's fucking nuts.</v>

897
00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:46.380
<v Speaker 1>Tim.</v>

898
00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:48.830
<v Speaker 1>Encounter Madison Square Garden to what you would,</v>

899
00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:50.390
<v Speaker 1>it was not enough seats there.</v>

900
00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:51.530
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

901
00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:55.640
<v Speaker 1>there'd be full of just fucking GSP versus it looked like the Oscars is just be</v>

902
00:22:55.641 --> 00:22:56.930
<v Speaker 1>as crowd full of celebrities.</v>

903
00:22:56.931 --> 00:22:58.460
<v Speaker 1>Regular folk can afford the tickets,</v>

904
00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:03.440
<v Speaker 1>especially if you get angry GSP GSP that wanted to punish Bj Penn GSP.</v>

905
00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:06.290
<v Speaker 1>I think it's really tough to bring it out.</v>

906
00:23:06.291 --> 00:23:08.870
<v Speaker 1>But you didn't like rush rush.</v>

907
00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:09.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

908
00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:10.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah man.</v>

909
00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:10.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

910
00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:11.330
<v Speaker 1>He was a motherfucker.</v>

911
00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:11.571
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

912
00:23:11.571 --> 00:23:16.571
<v Speaker 1>GSP was one of the weirder guys because he was such a nice guy at all times slot</v>

913
00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:18.590
<v Speaker 1>when guys fucked with him.</v>

914
00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:19.640
<v Speaker 1>There was this,</v>

915
00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:23.900
<v Speaker 1>this switch that would go off in that head and he would go on seek and destroy</v>

916
00:23:23.901 --> 00:23:25.940
<v Speaker 1>mode and he was so good at it.</v>

917
00:23:25.941 --> 00:23:28.850
<v Speaker 1>Man when he fucked up Bj Penn fucked up Fitch,</v>

918
00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:29.641
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

919
00:23:29.641 --> 00:23:31.400
<v Speaker 1>you wash those fights and you just go,</v>

920
00:23:31.401 --> 00:23:34.850
<v Speaker 1>that is arguably the greatest welterweight of all time.</v>

921
00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:35.710
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

922
00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:36.081
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

923
00:23:36.081 --> 00:23:39.650
<v Speaker 1>his ability to mix up the strikes and the take downs.</v>

924
00:23:39.651 --> 00:23:41.210
<v Speaker 1>We never knew what the fuck was going on.</v>

925
00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:41.690
<v Speaker 1>His,</v>

926
00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:44.180
<v Speaker 1>his constant victories and a scrambles,</v>

927
00:23:44.770 --> 00:23:45.201
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

928
00:23:45.201 --> 00:23:48.050
<v Speaker 1>and the Bj fight to where he was punishing Bj,</v>

929
00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:49.520
<v Speaker 1>he wanted to punish him.</v>

930
00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:49.941
<v Speaker 1>And when he,</v>

931
00:23:49.941 --> 00:23:53.480
<v Speaker 1>when he beat him down and didn't stop them and then walked over to the wall and</v>

932
00:23:53.481 --> 00:23:54.950
<v Speaker 1>fucking punched it afterwards,</v>

933
00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:57.230
<v Speaker 1>that's the motherfucker now.</v>

934
00:23:57.290 --> 00:24:02.180
<v Speaker 1>Does he come back or do we get that that safe GSP cause a safe GSP verse condom?</v>

935
00:24:02.181 --> 00:24:02.501
<v Speaker 1>We're not trying,</v>

936
00:24:02.501 --> 00:24:03.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to see that.</v>

937
00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:04.020
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot,</v>

938
00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:05.570
<v Speaker 1>there's a long time gone.</v>

939
00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:06.530
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

940
00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:09.410
<v Speaker 1>Who knows where G we're talking about GSP and Bj.</v>

941
00:24:09.810 --> 00:24:11.090
<v Speaker 1>Bj Penn's coming back to,</v>

942
00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:11.481
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

943
00:24:11.481 --> 00:24:12.800
<v Speaker 1>well I'm a,</v>

944
00:24:12.801 --> 00:24:14.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm excited to see what that looks like.</v>

945
00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:16.160
<v Speaker 1>Bj's fight in Tennessee.</v>

946
00:24:16.161 --> 00:24:19.700
<v Speaker 1>Vre and he's been at Jackson Winkeljohn his camp for quite a while now.</v>

947
00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:23.090
<v Speaker 1>So I'm assuming they're not letting him cut any corners.</v>

948
00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:23.631
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

949
00:24:23.631 --> 00:24:25.450
<v Speaker 1>not really running them through the real paces.</v>

950
00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:25.840
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>

951
00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:26.840
<v Speaker 1>if you're at Jackson's,</v>

952
00:24:26.841 --> 00:24:27.770
<v Speaker 1>there's no cutting corners.</v>

953
00:24:27.771 --> 00:24:28.610
<v Speaker 1>If you do your skin,</v>

954
00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:29.740
<v Speaker 1>you're asked Molly Wahpeton,</v>

955
00:24:29.770 --> 00:24:30.950
<v Speaker 1>then you wouldn't be there that long.</v>

956
00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:31.251
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

957
00:24:31.251 --> 00:24:32.084
<v Speaker 1>And get back on a plane,</v>

958
00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:32.540
<v Speaker 1>go home.</v>

959
00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:33.200
<v Speaker 1>And why would he,</v>

960
00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:36.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's been living out there for quite a while now.</v>

961
00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:36.853
<v Speaker 1>Hawaii down.</v>

962
00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:38.630
<v Speaker 1>That'd be pretty legit.</v>

963
00:24:38.631 --> 00:24:39.890
<v Speaker 1>GSP Negotiating Uba.</v>

964
00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:40.840
<v Speaker 1>UFC returned,</v>

965
00:24:40.841 --> 00:24:43.670
<v Speaker 1>but Reebok deal considers roadblock or there's a story.</v>

966
00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:44.700
<v Speaker 1>Mm hmm.</v>

967
00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:46.521
<v Speaker 1>Yeah man.</v>

968
00:24:46.521 --> 00:24:47.354
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

969
00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:49.700
<v Speaker 1>Just this whole thing bums me out.</v>

970
00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:51.680
<v Speaker 1>It was complicated.</v>

971
00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:52.640
<v Speaker 1>We'll see.</v>

972
00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:53.570
<v Speaker 1>We'll see what happens.</v>

973
00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:54.000
<v Speaker 1>But man,</v>

974
00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:54.401
<v Speaker 1>hope you can.</v>

975
00:24:54.401 --> 00:24:56.450
<v Speaker 1>That would be the 200 to end it.</v>

976
00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:59.180
<v Speaker 1>If you think you saved from asking square guy and fuck,</v>

977
00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:02.430
<v Speaker 1>do you think that would be Nate versus GSP of Connor doesn't do the car.</v>

978
00:25:02.431 --> 00:25:03.950
<v Speaker 1>So Connor's not on the card anymore.</v>

979
00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:04.851
<v Speaker 1>He's off today.</v>

980
00:25:04.851 --> 00:25:06.140
<v Speaker 1>He said I'm down to fight.</v>

981
00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:07.173
<v Speaker 1>He even goes,</v>

982
00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:09.260
<v Speaker 1>I will fly to New York and do a press conference,</v>

983
00:25:09.261 --> 00:25:10.280
<v Speaker 1>but then I gotta go back.</v>

984
00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:11.900
<v Speaker 1>So he's given a little wiggle room.</v>

985
00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:16.830
<v Speaker 1>I think it's time to drop the egos come to agreement and save 200 let Connie</v>

986
00:25:16.831 --> 00:25:19.640
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] name is Brennan Shab the reasonable one.</v>

987
00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:24.320
<v Speaker 1>How is this possible haired dude houses fossil Kenogenic Diet?</v>

988
00:25:24.321 --> 00:25:25.160
<v Speaker 1>Kido kid,</v>

989
00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:26.690
<v Speaker 1>I was super positive.</v>

990
00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:27.980
<v Speaker 1>Super clear mind.</v>

991
00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:34.570
<v Speaker 1>I like everyone and I hope they work that out for UFC 200 it'd be even better</v>

992
00:25:35.211 --> 00:25:36.230
<v Speaker 1>story if they're worked there too.</v>

993
00:25:36.231 --> 00:25:37.350
<v Speaker 1>They do get,</v>

994
00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:38.000
<v Speaker 1>they do.</v>

995
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.660
<v Speaker 1>I would almost guarantee they do or they do a GSP Nate Diaz fight.</v>

996
00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:44.000
<v Speaker 1>Then we got honey dick and then something smells fishy.</v>

997
00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:45.440
<v Speaker 1>Something smells fishy for sure.</v>

998
00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:46.310
<v Speaker 1>If GSP is like,</v>

999
00:25:46.311 --> 00:25:47.070
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:51.650

<v Speaker 1>I bet you everybody has a set of Reebok pumps in 6 million share.</v>

1008
00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:03.081
<v Speaker 1>I think a,</v>

1009
00:26:03.081 --> 00:26:04.040
<v Speaker 1>I bet they figured it out.</v>

1010
00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:04.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1011

<v Speaker 1>I bet.</v>

1012
00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:07.250
<v Speaker 1>I Bet Yukon or ends up fighting on UFC 200</v>

1013
00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:09.340
<v Speaker 1>that's why.</v>

1014
00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:10.730
<v Speaker 1>That's what I believe in,</v>

1015
00:26:10.731 --> 00:26:11.031
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

1016
00:26:11.031 --> 00:26:13.910
<v Speaker 1>I think Dana and the UFC brass gonna figure it out.</v>

1017
00:26:13.911 --> 00:26:18.140
<v Speaker 1>I think GSP Nate Diaz takes its place and they use it as a negotiating tool</v>

1018
00:26:18.141 --> 00:26:21.080
<v Speaker 1>because the paper view numbers are bigger than any of the Connor fights because</v>

1019
00:26:21.081 --> 00:26:23.870
<v Speaker 1>the UFC has in fact grown through their strategy.</v>

1020
00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:24.920
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

1021
00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:26.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't think the numbers beat Connors.</v>

1022
00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:27.313
<v Speaker 1>What if they do?</v>

1023
00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:27.681
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1024
00:26:27.681 --> 00:26:28.220
<v Speaker 1>then you got,</v>

1025
00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:28.550
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>

1026
00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:28.671
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1027
00:26:28.671 --> 00:26:31.520
<v Speaker 1>then Connor's GSP and Nate Diaz that you're like,</v>

1028
00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:31.910
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

1029
00:26:31.910 --> 00:26:32.870
<v Speaker 1>Connor fucked up.</v>

1030
00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:33.061
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1031
00:26:33.061 --> 00:26:33.894
<v Speaker 1>I kind of fucked up.</v>

1032
00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:36.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it beats as numbers though.</v>

1033
00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:40.830
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>
