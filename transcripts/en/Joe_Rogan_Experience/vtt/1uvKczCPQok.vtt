<v Speaker 1>Death went straight to Arnhem land in </v>

9
00:00:27.771 --> 00:00:27.900
<v Speaker 1>the northern territory of Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Complete opposite,</v>

10
00:00:27.901 --> 00:00:31.680
<v Speaker 1>like just first thing in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This wedding covered in mosquitoes,</v>

11
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.950
<v Speaker 1>flat barren ground and then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now humans like a small indigenous </v>

12
00:00:37.111 --> 00:00:40.410
<v Speaker 1>population out there and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then straight from there,</v>

13
00:00:40.411 --> 00:00:45.411
<v Speaker 1>so straight from Arnhem land to Sydney.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Met came in Sydney and then straight </v>

14
00:00:45.411 --> 00:00:47.470
<v Speaker 1>here to La and Florida and it's just </v>
<v Speaker 1>like at night.</v>

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.230
<v Speaker 1>How many people live here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Too many.</v>

16
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.290
<v Speaker 1>Too many.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's more people here than in the </v>

17
00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.290
<v Speaker 1>entire country of Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>knew something was going on.</v>

25
00:01:21.541 --> 00:01:23.820
<v Speaker 1>I kept seeing him looking over my </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoulder at this guy.</v>

26
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.530
<v Speaker 1>He grabs a bluetooth speaker and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like pretending like he's going to go to</v>

28
00:01:31.861 --> 00:01:34.380
<v Speaker 1>So let's just get him down and out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the store.</v>

29
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.320
<v Speaker 1>Then he goes to do a full runner for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

30
00:01:37.321 --> 00:01:39.330
<v Speaker 1>straight out the door with this </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bluetooth speaker.</v>

31
00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.400

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time I come here there's something</v>

35
00:01:47.311 --> 00:01:48.750
<v Speaker 1>crazy going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

36
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.810
<v Speaker 1>if you're in the wrong place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wrong time is plenty of crazy going </v>

37
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:54.120
<v Speaker 1>on in the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just so many people.</v>

38
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:55.530
<v Speaker 1>There's so many people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>

39
00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:56.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no way around it,</v>

40
00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.450
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fairly safe fit,</v>

41
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.840
<v Speaker 1>shooting water buffalo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each Sifa.</v>

42
00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:10.320
<v Speaker 1>Then fucking people's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy site for them.</v>

43
00:02:10.321 --> 00:02:13.020
<v Speaker 1>People know when you're Adam Green tree </v>
<v Speaker 1>may be.</v>

44
00:02:13.021 --> 00:02:15.000
<v Speaker 1>It's safer because you know what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>

45
00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.840
<v Speaker 1>but you were telling a story on whose </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast was it a J.</v>

46
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:23.730
<v Speaker 1>Scott's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget whose podcast it was.</v>

47
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.800
<v Speaker 1>You were telling a story about one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your friends that got gored federal </v>

48
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.180
<v Speaker 1>labor that got gored by scrub bullying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not good.</v>

49
00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.760
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely not good.</v>

50
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.960
<v Speaker 1>But I did I tell you that story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what happened?</v>

51
00:02:36.961 --> 00:02:38.980
<v Speaker 1>He shot a scrabble telling people </v>
<v Speaker 1>would've scrubbed bullets.</v>

52
00:02:38.981 --> 00:02:40.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So scrubbing bubbles like a,</v>

53
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.800
<v Speaker 1>just like domestic cattle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's been out in the wilderness </v>

54
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.800
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many generations.</v>

55
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.090
<v Speaker 1>Exactly the way they look and they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a real feral inbred looking.</v>

56
00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.910
<v Speaker 1>They're crazy look like rice cooking and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they they crazy dangerous.</v>

57
00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.270
<v Speaker 1>Here's a photo of him we looked at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

58
00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.520
<v Speaker 1>that looks amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is such a cool looking animal that </v>

59
00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.291
<v Speaker 1>was so much different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's pretty much a purebred </v>

60
00:03:04.291 --> 00:03:04.291
<v Speaker 1>Brahman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That one.</v>

61
00:03:04.291 --> 00:03:04.960
<v Speaker 1>There's that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

62
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

63
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.000
<v Speaker 1>Looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you said it's a purebred Brahma,</v>

64
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.860
<v Speaker 1>that means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

65
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.790
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a pretty good look bowl.</v>

66
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.880
<v Speaker 1>If you go up the top Jaimee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a couple more at the top.</v>

67
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.490
<v Speaker 1>That red one that you just done under </v>
<v Speaker 1>that one day.</v>

68
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.240
<v Speaker 1>That's a pretty typical scrabble a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

69
00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:22.990
<v Speaker 1>that's a fellow that I know actually in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia.</v>

70
00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:24.880
<v Speaker 1>Stick Ball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got.</v>

71
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got a by her,</v>

72
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.380
<v Speaker 1>that's what we have with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Jesus.</v>

73
00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.660
<v Speaker 1>Why do people do that to themselves?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the problem with these animals,</v>

74
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.490
<v Speaker 1>obviously they don't respect fences and </v>
<v Speaker 1>now going varied and interbreed with log</v>

75
00:03:36.491 --> 00:03:40.140
<v Speaker 1>of farmer's stock and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that,</v>

76
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.370
<v Speaker 1>is that bad for the farmer started?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Definitely.</v>

77
00:03:42.371 --> 00:03:47.371
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That they'll just go straight through </v>

78
00:03:47.371 --> 00:03:48.991
<v Speaker 1>fences and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll have a heap of carbs and I </v>

79
00:03:48.991 --> 00:03:50.680
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't be purebred anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they're not,</v>

80
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.600
<v Speaker 1>they don't good for rebranding or like </v>
<v Speaker 1>my fixed the same value at the market.</v>

81
00:03:55.601 --> 00:03:58.210
<v Speaker 1>So what is the difference in like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>genetics,</v>

82
00:03:58.211 --> 00:04:00.490
<v Speaker 1>like what do they look?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They look different,</v>

83
00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.520
<v Speaker 1>they look different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that first bullet Jamie showed was </v>

84
00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.120
<v Speaker 1>like a Brahmin bull,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then one of those scrub bulls,</v>

85
00:04:07.121 --> 00:04:12.121
<v Speaker 1>which is just bits of frigging every </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of bull over a lot of generations </v>

86
00:04:12.121 --> 00:04:14.020
<v Speaker 1>will come in and need and buried with it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then sort of wrecks the hood.</v>

87
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:19.320
<v Speaker 1>And when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when did they get released or when did </v>

88
00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:19.320
<v Speaker 1>they escape?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

89
00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:19.510
<v Speaker 1>it would have been with the cattle that </v>
<v Speaker 1>come into Australia.</v>

90
00:04:19.511 --> 00:04:21.520
<v Speaker 1>So it would have been hundreds and </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds.</v>

91
00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:26.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're just sort of morphed and </v>

92
00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.640
<v Speaker 1>become wild animals and wild bulls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very dangerous.</v>

93
00:04:27.641 --> 00:04:28.720
<v Speaker 1>Very dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

94
00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.790
<v Speaker 1>So what happened was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pedro,</v>

95
00:04:30.791 --> 00:04:32.230
<v Speaker 1>I shot these bullets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dropped,</v>

96
00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.960
<v Speaker 1>like dropped unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He fought it was dead,</v>

97
00:04:34.961 --> 00:04:37.150
<v Speaker 1>walked up to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It jumped up.</v>

98
00:04:37.151 --> 00:04:40.720
<v Speaker 1>Like he literally got up to it and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>jumped off and anyway,</v>

99
00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.490
<v Speaker 1>it ain't not getting him against the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tree.</v>

100
00:04:42.491 --> 00:04:45.820
<v Speaker 1>Like he ran to get up a tree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He felt it hit him and it sort of lifted</v>

101
00:04:45.821 --> 00:04:50.821
<v Speaker 1>him up the tree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He climbed up the tree is the growth </v>

102
00:04:50.821 --> 00:04:52.330
<v Speaker 1>vit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he felt something warm and his legs</v>

103
00:04:52.331 --> 00:04:54.330
<v Speaker 1>and look down and he's got and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything hanging down.</v>

104
00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.550
<v Speaker 1>I read legs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but use a tough boss that he gravity,</v>

105
00:04:57.551 --> 00:04:59.130
<v Speaker 1>stomach backup and sorta held the.</v>

106
00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.510
<v Speaker 1>Implies the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bull actually died.</v>

107
00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.890
<v Speaker 1>He climbed down out of the trade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ended up dawn two times,</v>

108
00:05:05.891 --> 00:05:09.020
<v Speaker 1>I think once in the air because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>royal flying doctors come in,</v>

109
00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.320
<v Speaker 1>grabbed him because he's a long way out </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the middle of nowhere.</v>

110
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:17.070
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and once on the tables operating table </v>

111
00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.951
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He survived all that and ended up dying </v>

112
00:05:19.951 --> 00:05:19.951
<v Speaker 1>of a bloody mess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Heart attack.</v>

113
00:05:19.951 --> 00:05:20.610
<v Speaker 1>So no way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

114
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:21.860
<v Speaker 1>When,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

115
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.180
<v Speaker 1>it was on the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was only 36 or 37.</v>

116
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:30.360
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it had anything to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the that I reckon it was related at all </v>

117
00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.870
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would think that a guy could get </v>

118
00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:34.990
<v Speaker 1>past getting gored by pushes guts back </v>
<v Speaker 1>into,</v>

119
00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:38.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to get a heart attack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's life's not fair.</v>

120
00:05:38.681 --> 00:05:40.510
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

121
00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.650
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>

122
00:05:41.651 --> 00:05:46.651
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was adjusting my shoot </v>

123
00:05:46.651 --> 00:05:48.850
<v Speaker 1>license card as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't have shoelaces,</v>

124
00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.170
<v Speaker 1>you got those fat tires.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a little in the weeds like those.</v>

125
00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.170
<v Speaker 1>Everyone asked me about my boots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll get a glimpse of me,</v>

126
00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:58.070
<v Speaker 1>whatever shoes I'm wearing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my</v>

127
00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.930
<v Speaker 2>shoot some awesome animal and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

128
00:05:59.931 --> 00:06:03.420
<v Speaker 2>what shoes you're wearing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are gearheads.</v>

129
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:09.160
<v Speaker 2>That's a big thing about hunting is how </v>
<v Speaker 2>many people are like crazy gearheads </v>

130
00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:09.220
<v Speaker 2>like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to know,</v>

131
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:10.850
<v Speaker 2>what kind of bow you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what kind of,</v>

132
00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:14.020
<v Speaker 2>what sites do you run in?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what kind of load of old.</v>

133
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:17.330
<v Speaker 2>It's really interesting to me maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I've done it for so long,</v>

134
00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:21.200
<v Speaker 2>but I sort of don't care about the gears</v>
<v Speaker 2>as long as it works,</v>

135
00:06:21.201 --> 00:06:22.640
<v Speaker 2>as good as it should,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

136
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:27.700
<v Speaker 2>and that's because everyone asks me to </v>
<v Speaker 2>keep doing these tip things as well and </v>

137
00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:27.710
<v Speaker 2>I hate doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate listening to them.</v>

138
00:06:27.711 --> 00:06:30.420
<v Speaker 2>But if you're a new guy coming into </v>
<v Speaker 2>bowhunting,</v>

139
00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.640
<v Speaker 2>then obviously you want to know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people love that stuff man.</v>

140
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:38.650
<v Speaker 2>Like John Dudley's tips that he does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he does these live instagram and </v>

141
00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:43.001
<v Speaker 2>youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but facebook feeds or he'll like take a </v>

142
00:06:43.001 --> 00:06:45.621
<v Speaker 2>bow apart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put it back together again and explain </v>

143
00:06:45.621 --> 00:06:46.940
<v Speaker 2>the cam systems are extreme with it to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hayes Hayes.</v>

144
00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.670
<v Speaker 2>My go to guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I don't know something that I'm doing</v>

145
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:53.240
<v Speaker 2>that's I'll go straight to Dudley.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dudley is podcasts.</v>

146
00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:58.260
<v Speaker 2>If you're into archery is called knock </v>
<v Speaker 2>on is the knock on podcast is without a </v>

147
00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:03.221
<v Speaker 2>doubt the most in depth archery podcast </v>
<v Speaker 2>from not just hunting from a hunting </v>

148
00:07:03.291 --> 00:07:06.200
<v Speaker 2>standpoint but from just target archery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How,</v>

149
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:08.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how important technique is.</v>

150
00:07:08.211 --> 00:07:13.211
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's a real master.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He loves it and he's a super geared to </v>

151
00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:14.630
<v Speaker 2>eight years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Has Your,</v>

152
00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.140
<v Speaker 2>has your cyber October going crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going good.</v>

153
00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:19.940
<v Speaker 2>The sober part's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The uh,</v>

154
00:07:19.941 --> 00:07:24.941
<v Speaker 2>the hot yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're in the homestretch today was a </v>

155
00:07:24.941 --> 00:07:24.941
<v Speaker 2>number 13,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I got two more.</v>

156
00:07:24.941 --> 00:07:28.841
<v Speaker 2>I'm banging them out this week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do tomorrow and Friday and </v>

157
00:07:28.841 --> 00:07:28.880
<v Speaker 2>be done with it because I want to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>back to doing other stuff.</v>

158
00:07:28.881 --> 00:07:33.881
<v Speaker 2>And when you do a 90 minute yoga class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to live weights or run or do </v>

159
00:07:33.981 --> 00:07:34.430
<v Speaker 2>anything else.</v>

160
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:35.720
<v Speaker 2>You don't really want to do anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>else,</v>

161
00:07:35.721 --> 00:07:38.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm just going to bang it out and get</v>

162
00:07:38.061 --> 00:07:40.450
<v Speaker 2>it over with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kim's done at once and she recommends.</v>

163
00:07:40.451 --> 00:07:45.451
<v Speaker 2>It was like hell on just the yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think she had a big drinking session </v>

164
00:07:46.281 --> 00:07:50.900
<v Speaker 2>before she was in Bali and she just made</v>
<v Speaker 2>some stupid promise,</v>

165
00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:56.760
<v Speaker 2>bolonaise woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the fifth bolonaise woman's </v>

166
00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:56.760
<v Speaker 2>ringing her up the next morning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

167
00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.850
<v Speaker 2>where are you if a yoga came,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just thought it was yoga though.</v>

168
00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.050
<v Speaker 2>So she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

169
00:08:00.051 --> 00:08:05.051
<v Speaker 2>I can do yoga in my sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she gets here and it's like in this </v>

170
00:08:05.051 --> 00:08:05.060
<v Speaker 2>hot room and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it might.</v>

171
00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:06.770
<v Speaker 2>It was killing us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bali too.</v>

172
00:08:06.771 --> 00:08:08.180
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very humid,</v>

173
00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:09.770
<v Speaker 2>humid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'd be Muggy as hell.</v>

174
00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:12.190
<v Speaker 2>Ari was talking about that today because</v>
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>

175
00:08:12.191 --> 00:08:17.191
<v Speaker 2>he does yoga in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is way more humid than it is in </v>

176
00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:17.620
<v Speaker 2>California.</v>

177
00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.930
<v Speaker 2>California is dry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he was probably loving.</v>

178
00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:21.860
<v Speaker 2>I just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

179
00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:27.450
<v Speaker 2>We went to a different place today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Today we went to a place that was more </v>

180
00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:27.860
<v Speaker 2>mild,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so not as hot,</v>

181
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:29.840
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

182
00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:31.820
<v Speaker 2>it's your body gets used to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting.</v>

183
00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:33.430
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's a lot like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

184
00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:36.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do that cryotherapy style you like did</v>

185
00:08:36.411 --> 00:08:40.310
<v Speaker 2>it to yesterday for the first time in </v>
<v Speaker 2>about three weeks I guess.</v>

186
00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:43.400
<v Speaker 2>And it was hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas I do it when I do it everyday.</v>

187
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:45.890
<v Speaker 2>It's not conditioned to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just get in there and I do,</v>

188
00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:50.920
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's quick how that conditioning goes </v>

189
00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:50.920
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

190
00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:51.020
<v Speaker 2>I hate to just say the peak tufts that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>did,</v>

191
00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:53.180
<v Speaker 2>it was pretty bad job of said to them </v>
<v Speaker 2>yet,</v>

192
00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:54.200
<v Speaker 2>here's are cutters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

193
00:08:54.201 --> 00:08:55.980
<v Speaker 2>I've never killed a bar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Going to kill the</v>

194
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:57.810
<v Speaker 1>cells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to come to Australia.</v>

195
00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:01.440
<v Speaker 1>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm scared to be honest with you.</v>

196
00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:06.830
<v Speaker 1>Every time I look at your instagram feed</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I see a brown snake that can kill </v>

197
00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:07.990
<v Speaker 1>you or a spider that can kill your </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking saltwater crocodiles.</v>

198
00:09:07.991 --> 00:09:12.991
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Playing with crocodiles the other day </v>

199
00:09:12.991 --> 00:09:12.991
<v Speaker 1>were coming into camp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

200
00:09:12.991 --> 00:09:14.790
<v Speaker 1>There was a couple of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish I captured it on video.</v>

201
00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:18.090
<v Speaker 1>It was one that she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a female anyway,</v>

202
00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:20.750
<v Speaker 1>she must've been coming around the back </v>
<v Speaker 1>of camp unnoticed.</v>

203
00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:22.560
<v Speaker 1>So the windshield was heading back to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the water.</v>

204
00:09:22.561 --> 00:09:25.860
<v Speaker 1>She was literally come and strike </v>
<v Speaker 1>through camp to get back into the water.</v>

205
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:28.560
<v Speaker 1>And you could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that thing.</v>

206
00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:31.170
<v Speaker 1>That photo doesn't do that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Justice.</v>

207
00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:33.930
<v Speaker 1>That photo scares the shit out of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a real.</v>

208
00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:37.170
<v Speaker 1>That's a real live monster out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How big was that fucker?</v>

209
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:40.630
<v Speaker 1>He's about five and a half meters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

210
00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:41.810
<v Speaker 1>He's giant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's always,</v>

211
00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:45.190
<v Speaker 1>you can even see it in the picture of </v>
<v Speaker 1>his body's just a real log crawl.</v>

212
00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:50.240
<v Speaker 1>Five and a half meters to Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want you to take about 15 feet marco </v>

213
00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:51.530
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

214
00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:54.210
<v Speaker 1>so a few people have been taken at this </v>
<v Speaker 1>spot.</v>

215
00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:58.620
<v Speaker 1>Mostly indigenous had been grabbed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Granted that spot over the years.</v>

216
00:09:58.621 --> 00:10:01.000
<v Speaker 1>And when you see an ancient piece like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

217
00:10:01.001 --> 00:10:02.760
<v Speaker 1>there's a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a man eater.</v>

218
00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:03.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

219
00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:05.790
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just ruthless.</v>

220
00:10:05.791 --> 00:10:06.900
<v Speaker 1>I like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How old do you think?</v>

221
00:10:06.901 --> 00:10:11.901
<v Speaker 1>A 15 and a half foot crocodile is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to comment because I don't </v>

222
00:10:11.901 --> 00:10:16.611
<v Speaker 1>know and I'll probably get it wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like to know like how long does </v>

223
00:10:16.611 --> 00:10:16.611
<v Speaker 1>it take them to grow?</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 and a half feet.</v>

224
00:10:16.611 --> 00:10:21.501
<v Speaker 1>So if you could find that Jamie </v>
<v Speaker 1>Saltwater CROC and I'm pretty sure that </v>

225
00:10:21.501 --> 00:10:21.501
<v Speaker 1>I believe over a hundred years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

226
00:10:21.501 --> 00:10:21.840
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they live a long time,</v>

227
00:10:21.841 --> 00:10:22.150
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

228
00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:26.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's ruthless to like people who live</v>

229
00:10:26.041 --> 00:10:27.990
<v Speaker 1>in Florida don't get those confused with</v>
<v Speaker 1>alligators.</v>

230
00:10:27.991 --> 00:10:30.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are different completely different</v>

231
00:10:30.061 --> 00:10:35.061
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we've got the freshwater crocodile </v>

232
00:10:35.061 --> 00:10:36.060
<v Speaker 1>which just lives in fresh water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then we've got the salt water crocodile,</v>

233
00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:37.720
<v Speaker 1>but he leaves in both,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

234
00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:39.780
<v Speaker 1>And so a lot of people get that </v>
<v Speaker 1>confused.</v>

235
00:10:39.781 --> 00:10:41.130
<v Speaker 1>I call it's fresh water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be right there.</v>

236
00:10:41.131 --> 00:10:42.390
<v Speaker 1>Go for a swim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

237
00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:45.000
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the fresh water crocodiles and not as</v>

238
00:10:45.001 --> 00:10:46.500
<v Speaker 1>aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not aggressive.</v>

239
00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:51.530
<v Speaker 1>They might get a bit territorial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not going to grab you to </v>

240
00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:51.660
<v Speaker 1>eight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the Saudi will grab you to a.</v>

241
00:10:51.661 --> 00:10:56.661
<v Speaker 1>He just looked like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they keep growing throughout their </v>

242
00:10:56.661 --> 00:10:58.701
<v Speaker 1>lifespan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>require more and more food with the </v>

243
00:10:58.701 --> 00:10:58.701
<v Speaker 1>amount.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the amount of food is unavailable,</v>

244
00:10:58.701 --> 00:11:02.511
<v Speaker 1>they die from starvation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason why you don't see a </v>

245
00:11:02.511 --> 00:11:02.511
<v Speaker 1>thousand year old crocodiles that are 50</v>
<v Speaker 1>feet long.</v>

246
00:11:02.511 --> 00:11:03.570
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the only reason.</v>

247
00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:07.560
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way they died of starvation or as if</v>

248
00:11:07.561 --> 00:11:09.810
<v Speaker 1>they contracted disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

249
00:11:09.811 --> 00:11:11.760
<v Speaker 1>They just keep growing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's why they.</v>

250
00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:15.510
<v Speaker 1>That's why these ones in captivity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they get hand fed.</v>

251
00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:17.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably get the biggest.</v>

252
00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:18.990
<v Speaker 1>That's where you'll see your biggest </v>
<v Speaker 1>crux.</v>

253
00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:22.860
<v Speaker 1>The Guinness Book of World Records,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Saltwater Crocodile Cotton Australia</v>

254
00:11:22.861 --> 00:11:26.040
<v Speaker 1>as the largest crocodile in captivity </v>
<v Speaker 1>measures 17 feet,</v>

255
00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:28.560
<v Speaker 1>11 point seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five inches.</v>

256
00:11:28.561 --> 00:11:31.470
<v Speaker 1>So basically 18 feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's huge.</v>

257
00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:34.350
<v Speaker 1>So that my body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my body,</v>

258
00:11:34.351 --> 00:11:39.060
<v Speaker 1>Andrew Equals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you heard of your ankles?</v>

259
00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:40.040
<v Speaker 1>No habit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

260
00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:42.870
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like a youtube sensation.</v>

261
00:11:42.871 --> 00:11:47.871
<v Speaker 1>He's been captured in just about </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything in Australia for the last </v>

262
00:11:47.871 --> 00:11:48.990
<v Speaker 1>millennium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

263
00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:54.800
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's seen a six w made a crocodile </v>

264
00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:54.800
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he's one of these guys.</v>

265
00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:58.891
<v Speaker 1>You don't bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if he says he's seen a six meter </v>

266
00:11:58.891 --> 00:11:58.891
<v Speaker 1>crocodile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's seen a six meter crocodile.</v>

267
00:11:58.891 --> 00:12:02.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's just the biggest one in </v>

268
00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:02.810
<v Speaker 1>captivity.</v>

269
00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:02.810
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's probably,</v>

270
00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:02.890
<v Speaker 1>and Australia has a ton of food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tons of food.</v>

271
00:12:02.891 --> 00:12:04.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like this,</v>

272
00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:06.280
<v Speaker 1>this starved to death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This river system.</v>

273
00:12:06.281 --> 00:12:10.300
<v Speaker 1>We went down there fishing and we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably traveled an hour down the river</v>

274
00:12:10.301 --> 00:12:15.301
<v Speaker 1>and a little tinny little boat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I reckon we've seen 200 to 250 salt </v>

275
00:12:16.791 --> 00:12:19.540
<v Speaker 1>water crocodiles in that time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

276
00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:24.630
<v Speaker 1>because like they can't harvest them or </v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't call me out or anything like </v>

277
00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:24.630
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did.</v>

278
00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:26.950
<v Speaker 1>There are laws protecting them so there </v>
<v Speaker 1>is as low as protecting them.</v>

279
00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:31.980
<v Speaker 1>So that's why the place is just riddled </v>
<v Speaker 1>with them at mathematical laws </v>

280
00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:32.370
<v Speaker 1>protecting them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like they're on posted.</v>

281
00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:36.250
<v Speaker 1>Well anything that's a night even </v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia is protected.</v>

282
00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:38.350
<v Speaker 1>So like you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know how you can hunt,</v>

283
00:12:38.351 --> 00:12:40.420
<v Speaker 1>you're white tailed deer and everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

284
00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:43.510
<v Speaker 1>Australia can't hunt Kangaroos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't hunt any native.</v>

285
00:12:43.511 --> 00:12:47.760
<v Speaker 1>So everything we hunting is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>introduced species and native.</v>

286
00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:52.060
<v Speaker 1>So you can't hunt them and there's been </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about bringing in like a program.</v>

287
00:12:52.061 --> 00:12:53.800
<v Speaker 1>But I don't know if it will happen but </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

288
00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:55.910
<v Speaker 1>that's so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

289
00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:59.290
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me to be very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like completely different system.</v>

290
00:12:59.291 --> 00:13:04.291
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it makes sense that you guys hunt </v>

291
00:13:04.291 --> 00:13:06.400
<v Speaker 1>all the non native species because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're invasive and devastate the wild,</v>

292
00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:11.430
<v Speaker 1>the land and the other wildlife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you guys have crazy problems with </v>

293
00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:13.360
<v Speaker 1>feral cats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We talked about that before and you know</v>

294
00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:16.720
<v Speaker 1>that you have pigs everywhere and nyman </v>
<v Speaker 1>donkeys,</v>

295
00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:22.110
<v Speaker 1>horses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even the funny ones that people don't </v>

296
00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:22.110
<v Speaker 1>think about like donkeys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wild horses,</v>

297
00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:23.110
<v Speaker 1>camels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think camels probably get a little bit</v>

298
00:13:23.111 --> 00:13:25.570
<v Speaker 1>of exposure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then we'll go to all your typical stuff.</v>

299
00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:26.410
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pigs,</v>

300
00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:28.720
<v Speaker 1>goats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got the 60 years bcs.</v>

301
00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:32.020
<v Speaker 1>So if we didn't have any of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>introduced species,</v>

302
00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:33.760
<v Speaker 1>we.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There'd be no hunting in Australia.</v>

303
00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:36.310
<v Speaker 1>So what but what do they say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sounds nuts.</v>

304
00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:39.460
<v Speaker 1>So they're only hunting just to get rid </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the invasive species?</v>

305
00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:44.630
<v Speaker 1>That's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do they control the populations of </v>

306
00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:45.340
<v Speaker 1>the Kangaroos or you can get like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>permit.</v>

307
00:13:45.341 --> 00:13:47.620
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't as a bow hunter or just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunter,</v>

308
00:13:47.621 --> 00:13:52.621
<v Speaker 1>couldn't get a permit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you're a professional shooter </v>

309
00:13:52.621 --> 00:13:53.980
<v Speaker 1>lucky shooting for human consumption or </v>
<v Speaker 1>petmate or something like that,</v>

310
00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:59.250
<v Speaker 1>or if you're a big land owner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get like a tag or permits to </v>

311
00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:03.250
<v Speaker 1>shoot Kangaroos then every now and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be an organized coal because they let</v>

312
00:14:03.251 --> 00:14:05.580
<v Speaker 1>them get so far out of control that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

313
00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:08.230
<v Speaker 1>they eat the ground down to just pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>

314
00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:13.530
<v Speaker 1>Then they lie around and die a slow </v>
<v Speaker 1>death of a couple of months because I </v>

315
00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:13.820
<v Speaker 1>lose nutrition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

316
00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:15.910
<v Speaker 1>they've weakened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't move and it's obviously,</v>

317
00:14:15.911 --> 00:14:17.890
<v Speaker 1>it's a bit very painful way for to go.</v>

318
00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:20.350
<v Speaker 1>Once it gets to that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like they like,</v>

319
00:14:20.351 --> 00:14:21.610
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to do a column now.</v>

320
00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:23.710
<v Speaker 1>So it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all it is,</v>

321
00:14:23.711 --> 00:14:26.080
<v Speaker 1>is we've spoken about these people were </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the greenies,</v>

322
00:14:26.081 --> 00:14:31.081
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people that really don't have a </v>

323
00:14:31.081 --> 00:14:34.020
<v Speaker 1>good picture on it and see that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carl or hunting program is actually </v>

324
00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:36.910
<v Speaker 1>better welfare for the animals because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they stay healthier and in check.</v>

325
00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:37.540
<v Speaker 1>Well they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

326
00:14:37.541 --> 00:14:39.480
<v Speaker 1>They don't have any predators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

327
00:14:39.481 --> 00:14:41.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some places got wild dogs and Dingos,</v>

328
00:14:41.591 --> 00:14:42.910
<v Speaker 1>but that's about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

329
00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:45.880
<v Speaker 1>And how many dingoes can take out a </v>
<v Speaker 1>kangaroo.</v>

330
00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:47.830
<v Speaker 1>Kangaroos get pretty goddamn bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

331
00:14:47.831 --> 00:14:48.370
<v Speaker 1>they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

332
00:14:48.371 --> 00:14:49.660
<v Speaker 1>they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They take them out,</v>

333
00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:51.290
<v Speaker 1>they try and take down buffalo and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

334
00:14:51.291 --> 00:14:52.610
<v Speaker 1>But they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They really?</v>

335
00:14:52.611 --> 00:14:54.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they very successful.</v>

336
00:14:54.261 --> 00:14:56.540
<v Speaker 1>They'd pick off a pig or a pig.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Little something like that.</v>

337
00:14:57.940 --> 00:14:59.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

338
00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:04.150
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't understand why they would </v>

339
00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:06.630
<v Speaker 2>not try to keep the crocodiles and check</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you've seen it.</v>

340
00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:11.690
<v Speaker 2>Hundreds and hundreds of crocodiles like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that because one of those things gonna </v>

341
00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:12.260
<v Speaker 2>eat what's going on here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie says in Malaysia,</v>

342
00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:17.950
<v Speaker 2>a CROC shut up in front of somebody's </v>
<v Speaker 2>shop and they were trying to get rid of </v>

343
00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:21.761
<v Speaker 2>it and they apparently don't know how </v>
<v Speaker 2>people have held a month ago and while </v>

344
00:15:22.371 --> 00:15:23.750
<v Speaker 2>they have helmets and maybe they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to hit,</v>

345
00:15:23.751 --> 00:15:28.751
<v Speaker 2>but it take.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy's got a gaffe was what is he </v>

346
00:15:28.751 --> 00:15:28.970
<v Speaker 2>going to do here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is trying to throw a tarp on it.</v>

347
00:15:28.971 --> 00:15:31.370
<v Speaker 2>So they called Jesus Christ like a bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea.</v>

348
00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:33.370
<v Speaker 2>This is hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all wearing Camo.</v>

349
00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:35.320
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but why are they wearing red camera?</v>

350
00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:38.300
<v Speaker 2>Or it might be the fireman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it looks like truck right there.</v>

351
00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:40.920
<v Speaker 2>But why the firemen were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do they blending into?</v>

352
00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:43.250
<v Speaker 2>Let's go right in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a uniform.</v>

353
00:15:43.251 --> 00:15:46.160
<v Speaker 2>You think they got their helmets on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Put that helmet.</v>

354
00:15:46.161 --> 00:15:51.161
<v Speaker 2>Looks like a motorcycle helmet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A different country captain diversity </v>

355
00:15:53.211 --> 00:15:55.340
<v Speaker 2>over here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie Vernon and big data.</v>

356
00:15:55.341 --> 00:15:57.650
<v Speaker 2>That's a good size.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Big fucker.</v>

357
00:15:57.651 --> 00:16:00.700
<v Speaker 2>And he's got his mouth open to like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

358
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:03.850
<v Speaker 2>bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll kill you all this gary,</v>

359
00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:04.520
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

360
00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:07.850
<v Speaker 2>they're so different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I grew up when I was,</v>

361
00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:10.250
<v Speaker 2>when I grew up actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I lived there for three years.</v>

362
00:16:10.251 --> 00:16:12.890
<v Speaker 2>I lived in Gainesville,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Florida and when I lived there,</v>

363
00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:16.370
<v Speaker 2>alligators were protected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They used to be protected and we used to</v>

364
00:16:16.371 --> 00:16:21.371
<v Speaker 2>go to this place called Lake Alice and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we would throw marshmallows and the </v>

365
00:16:21.371 --> 00:16:21.371
<v Speaker 2>water and the alligators would come up </v>
<v Speaker 2>and eat the marshmallows.</v>

366
00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:23.380
<v Speaker 2>But then they start snatching people's </v>
<v Speaker 2>dogs.</v>

367
00:16:23.381 --> 00:16:26.750
<v Speaker 2>I remember this one lady freaked out one</v>
<v Speaker 2>snatcher dogs just pull it right off her</v>

368
00:16:26.751 --> 00:16:30.650
<v Speaker 2>leash and she freaked out and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>started happening more and more.</v>

369
00:16:30.651 --> 00:16:35.651
<v Speaker 2>And then the population got denser and </v>
<v Speaker 2>denser one point in time they were </v>

370
00:16:35.651 --> 00:16:36.410
<v Speaker 2>endangered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now they're infested.</v>

371
00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:38.840
<v Speaker 2>Now there's so many alligators that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they.</v>

372
00:16:38.841 --> 00:16:43.841
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever seen that show swamp </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that show where they go hunting </v>

373
00:16:43.841 --> 00:16:43.841
<v Speaker 2>for alligators,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you know,</v>

374
00:16:43.841 --> 00:16:45.680
<v Speaker 2>people make purses and shoes and shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of them.</v>

375
00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:50.950
<v Speaker 2>They get 500 tags,</v>
<v Speaker 2>$500 so they can chew 500 fucking </v>

376
00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:54.050
<v Speaker 2>allocated just to keep the population </v>
<v Speaker 2>healthy.</v>

377
00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:58.160
<v Speaker 2>And the food is apparently very good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The tail meat is apparently delicious.</v>

378
00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:01.420
<v Speaker 1>I think Benny I brought in was just down</v>
<v Speaker 1>there somewhere,</v>

379
00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:06.730
<v Speaker 1>maybe a month back down there and now </v>
<v Speaker 1>like my set of line and hook them and </v>

380
00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:12.310
<v Speaker 1>taking a haven meet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously the girl off the skins and </v>

381
00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:12.310
<v Speaker 1>things like that.</v>

382
00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:12.660
<v Speaker 2>The leather of the skins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the meat is very good.</v>

383
00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:15.090
<v Speaker 2>Dudley handsome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He bow haunts him every year.</v>

384
00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:18.840
<v Speaker 2>He goes to Orlando outside of Orlando.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to be pretty cool.</v>

385
00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:20.160
<v Speaker 2>That'd be pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

386
00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:22.280
<v Speaker 2>they taste good too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're in.</v>

387
00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:27.300
<v Speaker 2>It's a conservation thing too because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like you really do need to control </v>

388
00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:27.300
<v Speaker 2>their population.</v>

389
00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:28.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia needs to get to that point.</v>

390
00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:33.290
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's happening now is they're pushing </v>

391
00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:33.290
<v Speaker 1>into domestic waters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

392
00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:33.610
<v Speaker 1>like Darwin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cds,</v>

393
00:17:33.611 --> 00:17:35.360
<v Speaker 1>like build around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

394
00:17:35.361 --> 00:17:40.361
<v Speaker 1>a big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big river being lit or a big water </v>

395
00:17:40.991 --> 00:17:45.991
<v Speaker 1>system and the guys would go swim in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and get taken all the time and I </v>

396
00:17:45.991 --> 00:17:47.350
<v Speaker 1>will people's dogs jumping and they get </v>
<v Speaker 1>taken.</v>

397
00:17:47.351 --> 00:17:49.800
<v Speaker 1>I think I've seen a video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it was Darwin</v>

398
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:51.950
<v Speaker 2>or where it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

399
00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:56.990
<v Speaker 2>some lady's filming and then just say </v>
<v Speaker 2>the back of a crock go on the luck of </v>

400
00:17:56.990 --> 00:18:01.791
<v Speaker 2>jetty and then the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the face of the crop comes out and it's </v>

401
00:18:01.791 --> 00:18:02.590
<v Speaker 2>got a full size domestic dog and its </v>
<v Speaker 2>jaws.</v>

402
00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:08.730
<v Speaker 2>It was imagined saying that how creepy </v>
<v Speaker 2>side it was swimming in a river system.</v>

403
00:18:08.731 --> 00:18:09.440
<v Speaker 2>Like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>

404
00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:12.340
<v Speaker 2>seems like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like some sort of aqua doctors.</v>

405
00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:16.020
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I big dog today.</v>

406
00:18:16.021 --> 00:18:18.510
<v Speaker 2>Just it runs like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

407
00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:23.600
<v Speaker 2>everyone talks about big foot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the one Jesus look at the color </v>

408
00:18:24.751 --> 00:18:25.950
<v Speaker 2>on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

409
00:18:25.951 --> 00:18:28.110
<v Speaker 2>that thing is so big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like fluffy.</v>

410
00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:30.600
<v Speaker 2>That is a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just a straight up.</v>

411
00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:32.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are they like?</v>

412
00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:35.640
<v Speaker 2>I think they're more than 30 million </v>
<v Speaker 2>years old.</v>

413
00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:37.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I really,</v>

414
00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:39.540
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they've changed in 30 plus</v>
<v Speaker 2>million years.</v>

415
00:18:39.541 --> 00:18:44.541
<v Speaker 2>I think they just look at everything as </v>
<v Speaker 2>potentially food and that's where the </v>

416
00:18:44.701 --> 00:18:46.530
<v Speaker 2>risk is and that's the assignment.</v>

417
00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:48.660
<v Speaker 2>If it's assigned with a big grizzly </v>
<v Speaker 2>bear,</v>

418
00:18:48.661 --> 00:18:53.661
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just look at everything as a va </v>

419
00:18:53.661 --> 00:18:54.630
<v Speaker 2>danger so they feel frightened and want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to attack it or it's food.</v>

420
00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:57.510
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever seen Jim shockey's show?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

421
00:18:57.511 --> 00:18:59.660
<v Speaker 2>that show uncharted that he does?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

422
00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:02.250
<v Speaker 2>Have yet jim shockey's uncharted one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them ones.</v>

423
00:19:02.251 --> 00:19:04.740
<v Speaker 2>He went to Africa and I think it was the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Congo,</v>

424
00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:07.230
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was the Congo River,</v>

425
00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:09.810
<v Speaker 2>south of the Congo River,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

426
00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:12.960
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a river and this,</v>

427
00:19:12.961 --> 00:19:16.440
<v Speaker 2>a native population that lived there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These villagers,</v>

428
00:19:16.441 --> 00:19:21.441
<v Speaker 2>they lived right on the river banks and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were just getting taken left and </v>

429
00:19:21.441 --> 00:19:24.890
<v Speaker 2>riper crocodiles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone in the village had like an arm </v>

430
00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:27.060
<v Speaker 2>missing or chunk cut out of their head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this sit right here?</v>

431
00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:28.590
<v Speaker 2>Jim shockey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mozambique,</v>

432
00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:29.670
<v Speaker 2>Mozambique.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There we go.</v>

433
00:19:29.671 --> 00:19:31.900
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Jim shockey's.</v>

434
00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:33.630
<v Speaker 2>Just amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But these things,</v>

435
00:19:33.631 --> 00:19:34.830
<v Speaker 2>look at what they got here.</v>

436
00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:37.020
<v Speaker 2>One of them was feasting on some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>an animal.</v>

437
00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:38.250
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at these guys.</v>

438
00:19:38.251 --> 00:19:43.251
<v Speaker 2>They all have like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a stump where their arm is and there's </v>

439
00:19:43.251 --> 00:19:47.061
<v Speaker 2>Jim and so they wanted to bring in </v>
<v Speaker 2>professional hunters to try to help </v>

440
00:19:47.491 --> 00:19:52.491
<v Speaker 2>control the population because they were</v>
<v Speaker 2>actively targeting the people that live </v>

441
00:19:52.491 --> 00:19:52.530
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And these people,</v>

442
00:19:52.531 --> 00:19:53.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they live in a very small,</v>

443
00:19:53.881 --> 00:19:57.630
<v Speaker 2>very primitive village and all they have</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the water.</v>

444
00:19:57.631 --> 00:19:59.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where they're getting their water</v>

445
00:19:59.251 --> 00:20:04.251
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which it off is about to fucking make </v>

446

449
00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:07.230
<v Speaker 2>I needed to refresh it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just,</v>

450
00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:09.700
<v Speaker 2>it happens on youtube from time to time </v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

451
00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:12.460
<v Speaker 2>on the computer or normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just normal.</v>

452
00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:13.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the browser.</v>

453
00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:18.560
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just does the poor people that lived </v>

454
00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:18.560
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

455
00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:18.820
<v Speaker 2>you just got to imagine if this is your </v>
<v Speaker 2>only play.</v>

456
00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:21.000
<v Speaker 2>These people aren't traveling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't have cars.</v>

457
00:20:21.001 --> 00:20:22.680
<v Speaker 2>They don't have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not flying anywhere.</v>

458
00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:27.950
<v Speaker 2>This is where they live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to build these sort of fences </v>

459
00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:31.880
<v Speaker 2>around these little tiny bays.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They build these small makeshift fences </v>

460
00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:36.940
<v Speaker 2>to try to protect themselves from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>crocodiles when they clean,</v>

461
00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:41.970
<v Speaker 2>they clean their food or gather water or</v>
<v Speaker 2>wash their clothes once that risk every </v>

462
00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:43.060
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>

463
00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:46.500
<v Speaker 2>This is one of the reasons why I do </v>
<v Speaker 2>these radical hunts because it makes you</v>

464
00:20:46.501 --> 00:20:48.030
<v Speaker 2>realize how good we've got it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

465
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:53.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a like we just go to the tap and </v>

466
00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:53.760
<v Speaker 1>turn the tap on and we get water or if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to share her a bath,</v>

467
00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:58.770
<v Speaker 1>it's in the comfort of your own house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These people are just trying to get </v>

468
00:20:58.770 --> 00:20:58.770
<v Speaker 1>water to drink and they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They could get snatched.</v>

469
00:20:58.770 --> 00:20:59.860
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have been snatched.</v>

470
00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:04.880
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that ridiculous?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's their life and there's no </v>

471
00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:07.531
<v Speaker 1>other life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know that their ancestors had been </v>

472
00:21:07.531 --> 00:21:07.531
<v Speaker 1>there and their grandparents had been </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

473
00:21:07.531 --> 00:21:09.490
<v Speaker 1>Their fathers had been there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their mothers and now them.</v>

474
00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:14.570
<v Speaker 1>And this is life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why anytime someone complains </v>

475
00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:15.430
<v Speaker 1>about Australia or it in theU ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>s or whatever,</v>

476
00:21:15.431 --> 00:21:15.970
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

477
00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:21.190
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go look at what you have got so easy.</v>

478
00:21:21.191 --> 00:21:22.780
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so crazy.</v>

479
00:21:22.781 --> 00:21:27.781
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was watching your instagram feed when </v>

480
00:21:27.781 --> 00:21:29.311
<v Speaker 1>you were taking water or this buffalo </v>
<v Speaker 1>wallow and throwing it through a filter </v>

481
00:21:29.311 --> 00:21:29.311
<v Speaker 1>and put it in.</v>

482
00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:34.320
<v Speaker 1>Now when you're a bit concerned about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that because I like when I looked into </v>

483
00:21:34.991 --> 00:21:36.440
<v Speaker 1>the filter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just even video.</v>

484
00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:41.470
<v Speaker 1>Is that on your instagram?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be still alive on the </v>

485
00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:41.470
<v Speaker 1>instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's on normal.</v>

486
00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:45.360
<v Speaker 1>So normal instagram normally go to cvs </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that way we could see.</v>

487
00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:50.400
<v Speaker 1>So to start as I moved probably 200 </v>
<v Speaker 1>buffalo off that water hall and like a </v>

488
00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:53.140
<v Speaker 1>couple of mobs of pigs that were all </v>
<v Speaker 1>like they go and ride out into the water</v>

489
00:21:53.141 --> 00:21:58.141
<v Speaker 1>and try and cool off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has a least one big salt water </v>

490
00:21:58.141 --> 00:22:01.321
<v Speaker 1>crocodile in there as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm walking out there with that bag </v>

491
00:22:01.321 --> 00:22:01.321
<v Speaker 1>to you by yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

492
00:22:01.321 --> 00:22:02.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm by myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

493
00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:05.590
<v Speaker 1>And I'm sleeping in a little cloth </v>
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

494
00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:07.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a guys back in camp,</v>

495
00:22:07.721 --> 00:22:12.721
<v Speaker 1>but I was just down in the hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wyoming so that it just said this was </v>

496
00:22:12.721 --> 00:22:12.721
<v Speaker 1>pretty new.</v>

497
00:22:12.721 --> 00:22:12.721
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know if it was older.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

498
00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:15.940
<v Speaker 1>I think it's it and yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

499
00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:20.970
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm barefoot walking up to the water </v>

500
00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:22.380
<v Speaker 1>with this pumps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going look at this.</v>

501
00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:23.870
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at.</v>

502
00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:28.890
<v Speaker 1>This is a big frigging buffalo to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting right there in the water that's </v>

503
00:22:29.441 --> 00:22:34.441
<v Speaker 1>old for the water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do not drink and then frigging dehydrate</v>

504
00:22:35.111 --> 00:22:37.390
<v Speaker 1>and die out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you drink and Turd water.</v>

505
00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:40.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I hope the field to work.</v>

506
00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:42.310
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do these filters work?</v>

507
00:22:42.311 --> 00:22:43.120
<v Speaker 1>How does that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

508
00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:46.720
<v Speaker 1>they claim to filter out 99 point nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine,</v>

509
00:22:46.721 --> 00:22:47.210
<v Speaker 1>nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine,</v>

510
00:22:47.211 --> 00:22:49.860
<v Speaker 1>nine percent of all the germs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's zero,</v>

511
00:22:49.861 --> 00:22:50.400
<v Speaker 1>zero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>zero,</v>

512
00:22:50.401 --> 00:22:50.960
<v Speaker 1>zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One.</v>

513
00:22:50.961 --> 00:22:55.420
<v Speaker 1>It's going to fuck you or something on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the edge of the bag that runs down,</v>

514
00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:57.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's probably going to get you.</v>

515
00:22:57.641 --> 00:23:02.641
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how often do you get beaver fever when </v>

516
00:23:02.641 --> 00:23:02.641
<v Speaker 1>you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never been,</v>

517
00:23:02.641 --> 00:23:04.810
<v Speaker 1>I've never been sick from drinking water</v>
<v Speaker 1>out in the Bush or eating.</v>

518
00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:07.150
<v Speaker 1>That's any of the meat or anything like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

519
00:23:07.151 --> 00:23:08.080
<v Speaker 1>Never ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever,</v>

520
00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:10.540
<v Speaker 1>ever talked to dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spends time in the bush,</v>

521
00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:13.220
<v Speaker 1>gets sick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How have you not gotten anybody?</v>

522
00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:16.090
<v Speaker 1>Andrea equals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And He seems like a pretty hardy dude.</v>

523
00:23:16.690 --> 00:23:17.560
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

524
00:23:17.561 --> 00:23:18.700
<v Speaker 1>so have you had this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

525
00:23:18.701 --> 00:23:19.590
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you had this?</v>

526
00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:20.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

527
00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:22.990
<v Speaker 1>have you had this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like not nearly died from this.</v>

528
00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:23.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

529
00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:26.020
<v Speaker 1>I've had none of those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've drank.</v>

530
00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:28.540
<v Speaker 1>There was one time I was so desperate </v>
<v Speaker 1>for water.</v>

531
00:23:28.541 --> 00:23:33.541
<v Speaker 1>This has gone back to when I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looks like actually it looks all right.</v>

532
00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:35.890
<v Speaker 1>It looks pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Taste off the filter.</v>

533
00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:39.910
<v Speaker 1>The water tastes like Piss piss and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

534
00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:45.060
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't have that filter because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>taste is obviously something but it's </v>

535
00:23:46.131 --> 00:23:51.131
<v Speaker 1>still piss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still paced but it's probably </v>

536
00:23:51.131 --> 00:23:53.921
<v Speaker 1>actually really good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Drinking is good friend with Duke in </v>

537
00:23:53.921 --> 00:23:53.921
<v Speaker 1>that water.</v>

538
00:23:53.921 --> 00:23:55.010
<v Speaker 1>Do you put like a c?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got a mountain ops bottle.</v>

539
00:23:55.011 --> 00:23:58.280
<v Speaker 1>Do you put some flavor in there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just to mask it a bit.</v>

540
00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:03.340
<v Speaker 1>I think I'd run out at this point that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was like 27 kilometer hike that day.</v>

541
00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:06.590
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you just deal with the taste.</v>

542
00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:08.390
<v Speaker 1>Do you just deal with it and you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

543
00:24:08.391 --> 00:24:13.391
<v Speaker 1>you're that first either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't really bother you at the </v>

544
00:24:13.391 --> 00:24:13.391
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

545
00:24:13.391 --> 00:24:14.840
<v Speaker 1>when you did that epic hunt up here in </v>
<v Speaker 1>cow in,</v>

546
00:24:14.841 --> 00:24:17.090
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were starting in Colorado.</v>

547
00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:19.310
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you went to Idaho,</v>

548
00:24:19.311 --> 00:24:24.311
<v Speaker 1>Idaho,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't actually hunt Idaho across </v>

549
00:24:24.311 --> 00:24:24.311
<v Speaker 1>through Idaho into the back of Montana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

550
00:24:24.311 --> 00:24:29.250
<v Speaker 1>And trying to find a spot with limited </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunters and more elk and we were all </v>

551
00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:31.950
<v Speaker 1>following you on instagram stories was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>tough haunt.</v>

552
00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:34.280
<v Speaker 1>Those tapes that I left out of it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>unlike,</v>

553
00:24:34.281 --> 00:24:39.281
<v Speaker 1>I'll just save this for Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but well I got really sick like for like</v>

554
00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:45.550
<v Speaker 1>they always just liquid coming out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>frigging every you got sick from waters.</v>

555
00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:48.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to admit that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

556
00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:51.770
<v Speaker 1>you just said you never got because a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of pit people writing me messages</v>

557
00:24:51.771 --> 00:24:56.771
<v Speaker 1>and like that's a good way to get sick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like I've done these heaps as </v>

558
00:24:56.771 --> 00:24:57.590
<v Speaker 1>long as you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you drank red on the ground.</v>

559
00:24:57.630 --> 00:24:58.700
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually,</v>

560
00:24:58.701 --> 00:25:03.701
<v Speaker 1>I ate some jerky that had been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I left it in the tank and the tank got </v>

561
00:25:03.701 --> 00:25:04.430
<v Speaker 1>really hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the start of the hunt.</v>

562
00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:06.350
<v Speaker 1>It was the heat was soaring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

563
00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:07.750
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

564
00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:09.800
<v Speaker 1>he wouldn't be sweaty in that in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bag,</v>

565
00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:12.200
<v Speaker 1>but I'll stop and so I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to eat it.</v>

566
00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:15.670
<v Speaker 1>And then it was nearly like two hours </v>
<v Speaker 1>later that I was lucky.</v>

567
00:25:15.790 --> 00:25:20.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel real good about 'em.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never been tent bound in me life </v>

568
00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:21.800
<v Speaker 1>and I'm just like not just keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>haunting,</v>

569
00:25:21.801 --> 00:25:22.520
<v Speaker 1>don't worry about it.</v>

570
00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:26.390
<v Speaker 1>So this is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably shouldn't say it,</v>

571
00:25:26.391 --> 00:25:30.940
<v Speaker 1>but I literally hunt for five minutes </v>
<v Speaker 1>and have to pull me straight down,</v>

572
00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:36.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then go number twos and then walk </v>

573
00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:36.400
<v Speaker 1>for another five minutes and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck,</v>

574
00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:41.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>informed my brains out for a couple of </v>

575
00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:41.400
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two days,</v>

576
00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:43.880
<v Speaker 1>two days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's because I lost 17 kilos.</v>

577
00:25:43.881 --> 00:25:46.820
<v Speaker 1>I reckon I lost 10 of them in them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Couple of days.</v>

578
00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:49.340
<v Speaker 1>What's that in pounds?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seventeen kilos.</v>

579
00:25:49.341 --> 00:25:50.600
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thirty five.</v>

580
00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:56.400
<v Speaker 1>Lost that much weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yet I had my pants were falling off me </v>

581
00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:56.400
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

582
00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:58.790
<v Speaker 1>like literally falling off me from being</v>
<v Speaker 1>taught on the to fallen off me.</v>

583
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.940
<v Speaker 1>So this was because you were hiking </v>
<v Speaker 1>every day.</v>

584
00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:03.260
<v Speaker 1>Just how I can everyday I w I hiked over</v>
<v Speaker 1>frowned,</v>

585
00:26:03.261 --> 00:26:05.330
<v Speaker 1>remodels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold up for a hundred and 14 miles.</v>

586
00:26:05.331 --> 00:26:07.340
<v Speaker 1>I think it was all up 22 days.</v>

587
00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:11.570
<v Speaker 1>That's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's limited food and um,</v>

588
00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:14.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that bad jerky helped as well.</v>

589
00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:19.610
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to start a weight loss </v>
<v Speaker 1>program or my friend Burke.</v>

590
00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:22.370
<v Speaker 1>It did a yoga today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's obsessed with you.</v>

591
00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:27.620
<v Speaker 1>Is going to be on the podcast as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kim sent me a link and she's like,</v>

592
00:26:27.651 --> 00:26:29.660
<v Speaker 1>you should have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should listen to this podcast.</v>

593
00:26:29.661 --> 00:26:32.300
<v Speaker 1>And I listened to it and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I could be friends with that</v>

594
00:26:32.301 --> 00:26:33.740
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

595
00:26:33.741 --> 00:26:34.490
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can be friends.</v>

596
00:26:34.670 --> 00:26:37.490
<v Speaker 1>Then he put frigging on Instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some dude trying to milk.</v>

597
00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:40.220
<v Speaker 1>He's nibbles and we can't be fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>

598
00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:47.360
<v Speaker 1>but he's won me back either because he'd</v>
<v Speaker 1>done that hilarious video if you dance </v>

599
00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:50.280
<v Speaker 1>in the dialogue was crying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

600
00:26:50.281 --> 00:26:52.020
<v Speaker 1>we did our uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>13th.</v>

601
00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:55.950
<v Speaker 1>He and I did our 13th yoga class today </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Ren Tom are on number 14.</v>

602
00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:57.600
<v Speaker 1>Two more to go for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One for logos.</v>

603
00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:01.030
<v Speaker 1>Those two guys told at the homestretch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

604
00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:04.590
<v Speaker 1>nothing compared to 28 days in the bush.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was good.</v>

605
00:27:04.591 --> 00:27:07.050
<v Speaker 1>I loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I missed a lot of things.</v>

606
00:27:07.051 --> 00:27:08.760
<v Speaker 1>Like it makes you realize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

607
00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:13.820
<v Speaker 1>like I said how lucky we are off and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've always been the person that </v>

608
00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:15.780
<v Speaker 1>doesn't take anything for granted </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>

609
00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:17.550
<v Speaker 1>but it's just that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

610
00:27:17.551 --> 00:27:19.050
<v Speaker 1>it really rings home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

611
00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:22.410
<v Speaker 1>the simple thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you just just went out there.</v>

612
00:27:22.411 --> 00:27:27.411
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't necessarily have a good area </v>

613
00:27:27.411 --> 00:27:27.411
<v Speaker 1>that had been scouted out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Definitely didn't have a good area,</v>

614
00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:32.420
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>met a real nice young dude actually </v>

615
00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:35.631
<v Speaker 1>messaged me for instagram at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could hardly get to any messages and </v>

616
00:27:35.631 --> 00:27:35.631
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

617
00:27:35.631 --> 00:27:36.960
<v Speaker 1>that was one that I read and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

618
00:27:36.961 --> 00:27:39.540
<v Speaker 1>while you're in this unit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he picked what unit is he in?</v>

619
00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:44.960
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come over to this area of hunter for </v>

620
00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:45.030
<v Speaker 1>pretty much my whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a few good bulls there.</v>

621
00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:48.450
<v Speaker 1>Now the first day or the second day that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in there,</v>

622
00:27:48.451 --> 00:27:52.320
<v Speaker 1>I was saying three really good bulls and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what kept me there because I kept</v>

623
00:27:52.321 --> 00:27:54.750
<v Speaker 1>thinking I'm going to find them bulls </v>
<v Speaker 1>again and I just cleaned off.</v>

624
00:27:54.810 --> 00:27:56.720
<v Speaker 1>I just moved out of the area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

625
00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:02.600
<v Speaker 1>the whole idea of hunting in Colorado </v>
<v Speaker 1>was because last year I had a couple of </v>

626
00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:04.500
<v Speaker 1>issues with grizzlies in Montana and </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing saw law.</v>

627
00:28:04.501 --> 00:28:09.501
<v Speaker 1>I'm lucky you're a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a decade if you do that again </v>

628
00:28:09.501 --> 00:28:10.260
<v Speaker 1>because you got three young kids and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful wife.</v>

629
00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:13.290
<v Speaker 1>Like it's a big risk to take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I take risks,</v>

630
00:28:13.291 --> 00:28:15.290
<v Speaker 1>but that's one that's out of my control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

631
00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:16.220
<v Speaker 1>grizzly going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

632
00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:21.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I kept trying to avoid that area </v>

633
00:28:21.290 --> 00:28:21.290
<v Speaker 1>and then when I wasn't fun in bulls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

634
00:28:21.290 --> 00:28:25.880
<v Speaker 1>so I ended up moving out to Colorado,</v>
<v Speaker 1>went to Idaho and walked into the back </v>

635
00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:27.750
<v Speaker 1>of Montana where there's supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>less grizzlies.</v>

636
00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:30.240
<v Speaker 1>And that's where I got charged by </v>
<v Speaker 1>grizzly bears.</v>

637
00:28:30.241 --> 00:28:32.100
<v Speaker 1>A lot of grizzlies and Montana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

638
00:28:32.101 --> 00:28:34.080
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're out of control too.</v>

639
00:28:34.081 --> 00:28:36.060
<v Speaker 1>They just frigging like the crocs on dry</v>
<v Speaker 1>land.</v>

640
00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:39.110
<v Speaker 1>You saw grizzlies in Colorado?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did yet.</v>

641
00:28:39.170 --> 00:28:41.220
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the cutest thing.</v>

642
00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:44.370
<v Speaker 1>I've caught so much flack over that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you're positive.</v>

643
00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:47.350
<v Speaker 1>These were grizzle hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what does a black.</v>

644
00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:51.230
<v Speaker 1>There's black bear in the same area and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I nearly could do the comparison because</v>

645
00:28:51.231 --> 00:28:56.231
<v Speaker 1>it was a black bear there and it was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>grizzly day saying the black bear first </v>

646
00:28:56.231 --> 00:28:56.231
<v Speaker 1>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

647
00:28:56.231 --> 00:28:57.330
<v Speaker 1>this in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll see the video.</v>

648
00:28:57.331 --> 00:28:57.690
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

649
00:28:57.691 --> 00:28:59.280
<v Speaker 1>there's a black bear over there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty cool.</v>

650
00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:02.010
<v Speaker 1>She's got cubs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I just want to try and avoid her.</v>

651
00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:04.900
<v Speaker 1>Then looking at these Alpha Bayer and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all this thing.</v>

652
00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:08.190
<v Speaker 1>Grizzlies before this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that completely different beasts.</v>

653
00:29:08.191 --> 00:29:09.600
<v Speaker 1>There's no mistake in the two.</v>

654
00:29:09.810 --> 00:29:12.340
<v Speaker 1>It's not like a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just the.</v>

655
00:29:13.030 --> 00:29:16.050
<v Speaker 1>That's a young looking Greasley that </v>
<v Speaker 1>might tell it now.</v>

656
00:29:16.051 --> 00:29:17.790
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a big black bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

657
00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:21.990
<v Speaker 1>it's a frigging massive grizzly and </v>
<v Speaker 1>compare it to a massive black bed.</v>

658
00:29:21.991 --> 00:29:25.080
<v Speaker 1>There's still a massive height </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference and everything.</v>

659
00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:30.110
<v Speaker 1>The big write up shoulders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The big square head spotting scope with </v>

660
00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:33.771
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I did not just have maybe been </v>

661
00:29:33.771 --> 00:29:34.820
<v Speaker 1>oculus and 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>40 two's 10 by 42 is the mavens yet.</v>

662
00:29:35.090 --> 00:29:38.150
<v Speaker 1>So the same one too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got a good look at it.</v>

663
00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:39.090
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

664
00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:42.250
<v Speaker 1>but at that point I just figured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>

665
00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:47.280
<v Speaker 1>there is grizzlies in Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just the couple of people that told me </v>

666
00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:48.520
<v Speaker 1>all you won't see grizzlies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just didn't know the area.</v>

667
00:29:48.521 --> 00:29:49.900
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I didn't think much of it.</v>

668
00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:55.260
<v Speaker 1>So I did the little film for the buyer </v>
<v Speaker 1>knows and stuff like that and like </v>

669
00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:55.260
<v Speaker 1>there's a big Mama grizzly up there.</v>

670
00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:57.430
<v Speaker 1>She's got carbs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I definitely want to stay away from her.</v>

671
00:29:58.030 --> 00:30:03.030
<v Speaker 1>Then I wanted the whole my ass out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that because that's an advice and I </v>

672
00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:07.381
<v Speaker 1>wanted the whole mindset of that Bison </v>
<v Speaker 1>and not sleeping that base in for the </v>

673
00:30:07.381 --> 00:30:08.140
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I've moved on pretty quick.</v>

674
00:30:08.141 --> 00:30:09.880
<v Speaker 1>Got to the top of the ridge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looked at her again.</v>

675
00:30:09.881 --> 00:30:11.530
<v Speaker 1>She was fading along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like cool.</v>

676
00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:14.650
<v Speaker 1>Then slept on the other side of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridge.</v>

677
00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:16.960
<v Speaker 1>Then come back through there in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>morning,</v>

678
00:30:16.961 --> 00:30:20.080
<v Speaker 1>spotted her again in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kept walking out of there.</v>

679
00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:23.620
<v Speaker 1>Then I got reception again and then I </v>
<v Speaker 1>had a hit with messages.</v>

680
00:30:23.621 --> 00:30:25.450
<v Speaker 1>There's not supposed to be an ingredient</v>
<v Speaker 1>leads in Colorado.</v>

681
00:30:25.451 --> 00:30:26.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

682
00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:28.960
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just blew it off as in,</v>

683
00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:30.380
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is grizzlies here.</v>

684
00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:31.690
<v Speaker 1>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these guys got it wrong.</v>

685
00:30:32.050 --> 00:30:35.620
<v Speaker 1>Not that it's a massive big deal and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is not supposed to be at all and no</v>

686
00:30:35.621 --> 00:30:37.510
<v Speaker 1>one wants to admit that there are there.</v>

687
00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:42.550
<v Speaker 1>So this is a no one wants to admit it or</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it you were deep into the tree?</v>

688
00:30:42.610 --> 00:30:43.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that as well.</v>

689
00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:48.040
<v Speaker 1>So there's a multiple sightings in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>area.</v>

690
00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:53.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say the area because </v>
<v Speaker 1>next year I'm going to go back and </v>

691
00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:55.891
<v Speaker 1>document it with a decent camera and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything like that to try to get some </v>

692
00:30:55.891 --> 00:30:58.690
<v Speaker 1>video of too and get some real good </v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence and stuff like that.</v>

693
00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:04.020
<v Speaker 1>So I haven't really spoken about a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>since then because I just got pounded </v>

694
00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:05.560
<v Speaker 1>with messages going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no grizzlies in Colorado,</v>

695
00:31:05.561 --> 00:31:07.090
<v Speaker 1>you idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What don't you want to tell?</v>

696
00:31:07.091 --> 00:31:10.600
<v Speaker 1>Like wildlife biologists or someone that</v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently they already know and I don't</v>

697
00:31:10.601 --> 00:31:14.210
<v Speaker 1>want to admit it because of the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>protected space.</v>

698
00:31:14.211 --> 00:31:15.980
<v Speaker 1>He's act and everything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

699
00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:20.990
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would they want to admit that </v>

700
00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:20.990
<v Speaker 1>there's bears there?</v>

701
00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:20.990
<v Speaker 1>I think it might be a pain in the ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

702
00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:22.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

703
00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:24.470
<v Speaker 1>but I'm keen to get to the bottom of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

704
00:31:24.490 --> 00:31:29.490
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of on this Yamaha.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I come back in there again and I'm going</v>

705
00:31:31.241 --> 00:31:35.080
<v Speaker 1>to try and get some good evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it seems to me that they would want.</v>

706
00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:40.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand why they would want </v>

707
00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:40.180
<v Speaker 1>to deny the existence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not able to lie,</v>

708
00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:40.930
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of people are saying this </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually.</v>

709
00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:47.490
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a website where it takes</v>
<v Speaker 1>in people's sightings and stuff like </v>

710
00:31:48.371 --> 00:31:52.360
<v Speaker 1>that and all the sidings and the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>grizzlies known in Colorado.</v>

711
00:31:52.361 --> 00:31:54.790
<v Speaker 1>We're all in this mountain range.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That probably gives a lot of it away.</v>

712
00:31:55.290 --> 00:31:57.130
<v Speaker 1>But the San Jose San Jose mountain </v>
<v Speaker 1>range.</v>

713
00:31:57.190 --> 00:31:57.970
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

714
00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:00.910
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's massive.</v>

715
00:32:00.911 --> 00:32:02.420
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

716
00:32:02.610 --> 00:32:05.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm not too worried.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of the last sightings were there and</v>

717
00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:07.820
<v Speaker 1>I think the last sightings were in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>eighties,</v>

718
00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:11.080
<v Speaker 1>maybe the early nineties there was </v>
<v Speaker 1>grease Liza,</v>

719
00:32:11.081 --> 00:32:13.150
<v Speaker 1>and when you look at a map and you look </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the range,</v>

720
00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:15.250
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be nothing for him to be there.</v>

721
00:32:15.251 --> 00:32:17.930
<v Speaker 1>Still was this bought new ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Walk in there.</v>

722
00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:20.000
<v Speaker 1>There's grizzlies in Wyoming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

723
00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:21.420
<v Speaker 1>Connected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

724
00:32:21.790 --> 00:32:26.790
<v Speaker 1>So of course they're probably there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do they think that you get up there </v>

725
00:32:26.790 --> 00:32:28.300
<v Speaker 1>and you have a look at this mountain </v>
<v Speaker 1>range and as just 100 percent in grizzly</v>

726
00:32:28.301 --> 00:32:29.180
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

727
00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:31.360
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that one there.</v>

728
00:32:31.361 --> 00:32:36.361
<v Speaker 1>I'm the last sighting occurred in 2,600</v>
<v Speaker 1>independent pass officials investigated </v>

729
00:32:36.361 --> 00:32:39.680
<v Speaker 1>but found nothing to 1979 bear had cubs </v>
<v Speaker 1>are likely dead.</v>

730
00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:42.290
<v Speaker 3>That's A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that a bear right there for that?</v>

731
00:32:42.291 --> 00:32:44.450
<v Speaker 3>They got on camera.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's obviously a grizzly.</v>

732
00:32:45.250 --> 00:32:46.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could tell the difference.</v>

733
00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:51.550
<v Speaker 3>I saw one in Alberta.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've only seen one if that is a </v>

734
00:32:51.550 --> 00:32:51.550
<v Speaker 3>colleague.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

735
00:32:51.550 --> 00:32:53.830
<v Speaker 1>This thing that I seen towel is over </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

736
00:32:53.831 --> 00:32:56.970
<v Speaker 1>like we're talking about a fully mature </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mava grizzly.</v>

737
00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:58.710
<v Speaker 3>So you're talking about like a 10 foot </v>
<v Speaker 3>bear.</v>

738
00:32:58.711 --> 00:33:00.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just a huge bear,</v>

739
00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:05.340
<v Speaker 1>like there's no mistaking it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This thing would windshields walk and </v>

740
00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:07.850
<v Speaker 1>you could see like she's out here like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

741
00:33:07.851 --> 00:33:09.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like had,</v>

742
00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:12.380
<v Speaker 1>when I get big and mature you'll see </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've got like a silver back on them,</v>

743
00:33:12.381 --> 00:33:13.790
<v Speaker 1>like a grip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a gorilla,</v>

744
00:33:13.791 --> 00:33:15.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've got this silver back on him like</v>

745
00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:20.470
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the last part of the hair goes </v>

746
00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:20.470
<v Speaker 1>silver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's that she's the right color,</v>

747
00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:22.220
<v Speaker 1>the right shape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right size and everything.</v>

748
00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:22.550
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

749
00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:27.680
<v Speaker 3>hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you only saw her in her cubs or you </v>

750
00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:27.680
<v Speaker 3>saw more?</v>

751
00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:30.300
<v Speaker 1>Her and her cubs and then Novalon </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a photo of another one that's </v>

752
00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:33.821
<v Speaker 1>just the cinnamon black bay are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think a lot of few people got </v>

753
00:33:33.821 --> 00:33:34.070
<v Speaker 1>confused and that's probably on my end </v>
<v Speaker 1>from.</v>

754
00:33:34.670 --> 00:33:38.090
<v Speaker 1>I just posted a story about a grizzly </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I had these other best shot</v>

755
00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:41.950
<v Speaker 3>static results from 2011.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It says actually steamboat springs.</v>

756
00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:43.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

757
00:33:43.390 --> 00:33:47.920
<v Speaker 3>That's Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nearly look at that as a cinnamon phase.</v>

758
00:33:47.970 --> 00:33:50.400
<v Speaker 3>Black Bay to go to a be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go,</v>

759
00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:52.450
<v Speaker 3>go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you make that larger Jamie?</v>

760
00:33:52.930 --> 00:33:56.830
<v Speaker 3>It's as big as it gets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That might be a grizzly.</v>

761
00:33:56.831 --> 00:33:57.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it could be,</v>

762
00:33:57.780 --> 00:33:59.320
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might be right though.</v>

763
00:33:59.330 --> 00:34:01.330
<v Speaker 3>That could be a collar phase.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brown bear,</v>

764
00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:02.470
<v Speaker 3>black bear rather</v>

765
00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:08.240
<v Speaker 1>test looking at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's a younger Greasley then maybe </v>

766
00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:11.021
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But she had this frigging massive head </v>

767
00:34:11.021 --> 00:34:12.740
<v Speaker 1>dude like flared out like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

768
00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:14.930
<v Speaker 1>the big read on the back and</v>

769
00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:20.240
<v Speaker 3>it'd be interesting if Adam Green tree </v>
<v Speaker 3>was the one who proved that they're </v>

770
00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:21.060
<v Speaker 3>almost dry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A grizzly bear was in Colorado,</v>

771
00:34:21.390 --> 00:34:26.390
<v Speaker 3>but the point is there's very few people</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are going to the mountain ranges.</v>

772
00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:28.550
<v Speaker 3>Like how far back were you from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>trail head at?</v>

773
00:34:28.551 --> 00:34:31.560
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I've wrote a really rough trail head</v>

774
00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:36.780
<v Speaker 1>on a mountain bike for so far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then that trial pretty much disappeared </v>

775
00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:39.490
<v Speaker 1>out to nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I hiked a full,</v>

776
00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:45.540
<v Speaker 1>must've been seven hours because she was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like just before sundown.</v>

777
00:34:45.790 --> 00:34:50.790
<v Speaker 1>So it would've been a good seven hours </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the back then and that's because </v>

778
00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:51.470
<v Speaker 1>there was no elk that's going nonstop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

779
00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:56.500
<v Speaker 1>and if you watched the video run a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of it because it was just what I call </v>

780
00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:56.500
<v Speaker 1>dead country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

781
00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:58.020
<v Speaker 1>there was not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not really good looking hunting country.</v>

782
00:34:58.030 --> 00:35:00.820
<v Speaker 1>So you'll see me sort of trotting along </v>
<v Speaker 1>most of it.</v>

783
00:35:00.821 --> 00:35:05.170
<v Speaker 1>So it was a long way back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no human footprints up there.</v>

784
00:35:05.171 --> 00:35:06.970
<v Speaker 1>There was nothing like that.</v>

785
00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:08.700
<v Speaker 3>Ten miles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>15 miles,</v>

786
00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:11.940
<v Speaker 1>probably 60 miles I think it was.</v>

787
00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:17.100
<v Speaker 3>So the odds of people going back there </v>
<v Speaker 3>on a regular basis are probably pretty </v>

788
00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:17.100
<v Speaker 3>slim.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very slim.</v>

789
00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:18.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they probably just don't know.</v>

790
00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:24.100
<v Speaker 3>And now that that's one of the issues </v>
<v Speaker 3>that apparently they're dealing with </v>

791
00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:24.100
<v Speaker 3>NBC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

792
00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:28.320
<v Speaker 3>in bc when you talk to the people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>live there versus the people that are.</v>

793
00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:32.650
<v Speaker 3>You know how BC has banned grizzly </v>
<v Speaker 3>hunting.</v>

794
00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:34.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The people that live in Greece,</v>

795
00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:36.680
<v Speaker 3>BC are terrified of that now because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>

796
00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:40.470
<v Speaker 3>we to control these goddamn things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you don't like what they say.</v>

797
00:35:40.471 --> 00:35:41.760
<v Speaker 3>The people that I know that live up </v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

798
00:35:41.761 --> 00:35:46.761
<v Speaker 3>they say the wildlife biologists are </v>
<v Speaker 3>rarely here like they need and the </v>

799
00:35:46.761 --> 00:35:48.630
<v Speaker 3>hunters that people that live up there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the outfitters,</v>

800
00:35:48.631 --> 00:35:52.800
<v Speaker 3>it's like you need to take like some </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of a census from us.</v>

801
00:35:53.050 --> 00:35:54.360
<v Speaker 3>Boots on the ground ground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

802
00:35:54.361 --> 00:35:54.990
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

803
00:35:55.020 --> 00:36:00.020
<v Speaker 3>and the way they describe it as like </v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a greedy bowman did a podcast </v>

804
00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:00.660
<v Speaker 3>about this with one of the guys that </v>
<v Speaker 3>lives up there,</v>

805
00:36:00.661 --> 00:36:05.661
<v Speaker 3>that's an outfitter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was saying we encountered them </v>

806
00:36:05.661 --> 00:36:07.040
<v Speaker 3>all the time and they're hyper </v>
<v Speaker 3>aggressive like you,</v>

807
00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:10.380
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These biologists that are rarely there.</v>

808
00:36:10.690 --> 00:36:15.690
<v Speaker 3>There's not like any like really </v>
<v Speaker 3>involved intricate census that they're </v>

809
00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:19.440
<v Speaker 3>doing with their go really in depth </v>
<v Speaker 3>accounting of all the bears.</v>

810
00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:24.740
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to get information from the </v>

811
00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:26.331
<v Speaker 3>people that lived there and do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to tell you there's a lot </v>

812
00:36:26.331 --> 00:36:26.331
<v Speaker 3>of them.</v>

813
00:36:26.331 --> 00:36:26.331
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

814
00:36:26.331 --> 00:36:30.810
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not smart enough to control </v>

815
00:36:30.810 --> 00:36:32.331
<v Speaker 1>their sales are because a lot of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>people just want to sit back and just </v>

816
00:36:32.331 --> 00:36:32.331
<v Speaker 1>let these animals do.</v>

817
00:36:32.331 --> 00:36:33.100
<v Speaker 3>Will do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the idea.</v>

818
00:36:33.101 --> 00:36:37.090
<v Speaker 3>They want to do NBC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They think that what they can do is,</v>

819
00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:42.180
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is speculation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they think that what they can do is </v>

820
00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:46.140
<v Speaker 3>let the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of let the people control the </v>

821
00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:49.570
<v Speaker 3>predators,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they think let the predators eat all the</v>

822
00:36:49.571 --> 00:36:53.450
<v Speaker 3>game that they can and then when they </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have enough food to,</v>

823
00:36:53.490 --> 00:36:55.390
<v Speaker 3>populations are naturally going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>diminish.</v>

824
00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:55.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

825
00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:59.100
<v Speaker 1>I like the idea that ain't gonna work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What can happen,</v>

826
00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:04.160
<v Speaker 3>but it could take 50,</v>
<v Speaker 3>60 years and the problem is along that </v>

827
00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:05.160
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna get a lot of human death,</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to get a lot of pets.</v>

828
00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:08.480
<v Speaker 3>You're gonna get a lot of animals that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are going to invade into farmlands.</v>

829
00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:12.120
<v Speaker 3>It just seems to me that that's not a </v>
<v Speaker 3>wise way to handle it.</v>

830
00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:13.110
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>definitely not.</v>

831
00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:18.200
<v Speaker 3>And it's also they're going to have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>pay money to kill problem bears and </v>

832
00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:21.270
<v Speaker 3>instead of making money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they don't like.</v>

833
00:37:21.330 --> 00:37:22.770
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this whole Cecil,</v>

834
00:37:22.771 --> 00:37:25.440
<v Speaker 3>the lion thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think fucked a lot of people up.</v>

835
00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:26.430
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

836
00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:31.460
<v Speaker 3>The idea of some evil person just going </v>
<v Speaker 3>over there and shooting some beloved </v>

837
00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:35.121
<v Speaker 3>animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That became the narrative and everybody </v>

838
00:37:35.121 --> 00:37:37.050
<v Speaker 3>sort of has this idea in their head that</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what bear hunting is.</v>

839
00:37:37.051 --> 00:37:39.420
<v Speaker 3>It's the same sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't want that MPC.</v>

840
00:37:40.250 --> 00:37:40.830
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

841
00:37:40.831 --> 00:37:45.831
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it really is something that needs to be </v>

842
00:37:45.831 --> 00:37:47.901
<v Speaker 3>discussed on both sides and I think both</v>
<v Speaker 3>sides have points when it comes to like </v>

843
00:37:47.901 --> 00:37:49.020
<v Speaker 3>quote unquote trophy hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

844
00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:50.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

845
00:37:50.061 --> 00:37:55.061
<v Speaker 1>I'm definitely not for one or the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like we want to walk them off </v>

846
00:37:55.061 --> 00:37:56.240
<v Speaker 1>the face of the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just want to see these healthy,</v>

847
00:37:56.350 --> 00:37:57.350
<v Speaker 1>a healthy population</v>

848
00:37:57.450 --> 00:38:02.450
<v Speaker 3>and the people that live around there </v>
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of them depend on moose meat </v>

849
00:38:02.450 --> 00:38:04.900
<v Speaker 3>and deer meat and these bear going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>decimate the populations.</v>

850
00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:06.780
<v Speaker 3>If they don't control the populations of</v>
<v Speaker 3>bear,</v>

851
00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:07.320
<v Speaker 3>they will.</v>

852
00:38:07.810 --> 00:38:12.810
<v Speaker 1>Something else has got to change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to decimate the game </v>

853
00:38:12.810 --> 00:38:12.810
<v Speaker 1>populations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

854
00:38:12.810 --> 00:38:12.810
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

855
00:38:12.810 --> 00:38:17.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually think the areas that I hunt </v>

856
00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:17.640
<v Speaker 1>in Montana aren't overpopulated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>grizzlies,</v>

857
00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:20.620
<v Speaker 1>from what I've seen just populated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just populated.</v>

858
00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:22.300
<v Speaker 1>So this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

859
00:38:22.301 --> 00:38:25.840
<v Speaker 1>the place that I ended up going into in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Montana isn't my usual spot,</v>

860
00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:30.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there wasn't supposed to be as many </v>

861
00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:32.341
<v Speaker 1>grizzlies and that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would have seen the video where I </v>

862
00:38:32.341 --> 00:38:36.120
<v Speaker 1>walk over the rise and then all of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sudden we locked eyes at the same time </v>

863
00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:40.590
<v Speaker 1>and then she in a split second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she just comes straight at me and I'll </v>

864
00:38:40.590 --> 00:38:42.010
<v Speaker 1>tell the story because he hates the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people keep asking.</v>

865
00:38:42.011 --> 00:38:47.011
<v Speaker 1>But I'm uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm one of these people that I practice </v>

866
00:38:47.011 --> 00:38:49.110
<v Speaker 1>with whatever I'm shooting with memory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the,</v>

867
00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:52.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the free day leafy suits came out,</v>

868
00:38:52.750 --> 00:38:57.750
<v Speaker 1>it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a camouflage suit and it had like </v>

869
00:38:57.750 --> 00:38:57.750
<v Speaker 1>free tea leaves on it hanging off it.</v>

870
00:38:57.750 --> 00:39:02.580
<v Speaker 1>And I like I got laughed at because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>went to the archery range and shot in </v>

871
00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:05.941
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the first time I shot in the string </v>

872
00:39:05.941 --> 00:39:06.580
<v Speaker 1>of the boat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hit the leaves in my shirt was off.</v>

873
00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:08.770
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ghillie suit,</v>

874
00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:11.170
<v Speaker 1>like just practice with whatever they </v>
<v Speaker 1>use.</v>

875
00:39:11.171 --> 00:39:15.370
<v Speaker 1>And so my buddies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sheriff in Idaho,</v>

876
00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:18.450
<v Speaker 1>he's gonna lend me a hand gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he lends me to hang on.</v>

877
00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:23.460
<v Speaker 1>Like dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never even tried to hang out and </v>

878
00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:23.460
<v Speaker 1>you just can't get them in Australia </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>

879
00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:26.551
<v Speaker 1>so I want to practice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We went out and practiced and we </v>

880
00:39:26.551 --> 00:39:28.320
<v Speaker 1>practiced with a cheaper bullet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

881
00:39:28.330 --> 00:39:31.720
<v Speaker 1>and it was like a solid solid bullet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was awesome.</v>

882
00:39:31.721 --> 00:39:33.890
<v Speaker 1>I picked it up straight away and there </v>
<v Speaker 1>was no dramas.</v>

883
00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:37.030
<v Speaker 1>I was a good shot with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just trying to do a rashad thinking if a</v>

884
00:39:37.031 --> 00:39:39.280
<v Speaker 1>bear of a Getcha it's going to be in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>rush.</v>

885
00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:40.760
<v Speaker 1>It's not like these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

886
00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:45.820
<v Speaker 1>pull it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pull the gun out and have a heap of </v>

887
00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:47.640
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was practicing shooting with one </v>

888
00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:47.640
<v Speaker 1>hand and everything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

889
00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:50.260
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to going on the hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he gave me some expense,</v>

890
00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:55.440
<v Speaker 1>pensive bullets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now our hollow point with like a </v>

891
00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:56.020
<v Speaker 1>real flat front on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we never shot those bullets.</v>

892
00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:57.550
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this grizzly charged,</v>

893
00:39:57.551 --> 00:40:01.420
<v Speaker 1>I pulled the gun out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she stopped at 20 meters the first time.</v>

894
00:40:01.421 --> 00:40:03.280
<v Speaker 1>Like I just try,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I stayed stationary,</v>

895
00:40:03.281 --> 00:40:05.020
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to do any radical </v>
<v Speaker 1>movements,</v>

896
00:40:05.021 --> 00:40:07.740
<v Speaker 1>but I just yelled at her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She stopped at $20,000,000.</v>

897
00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:12.750
<v Speaker 1>She turned back and went to a cub and at</v>
<v Speaker 1>this point I cubs just at the base of </v>

898
00:40:12.750 --> 00:40:16.681
<v Speaker 1>the tree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She got there as soon as she's saying </v>

899
00:40:16.681 --> 00:40:19.231
<v Speaker 1>that the cop was all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She just comes straight back at me </v>

900
00:40:19.231 --> 00:40:19.231
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

901
00:40:19.231 --> 00:40:20.680
<v Speaker 1>like massive bear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like rice and strike that made.</v>

902
00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:26.460
<v Speaker 1>I had the handgun to the handguns out </v>
<v Speaker 1>now because I pulled it out the first </v>

903
00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:29.641
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This time she come all the way to 10 </v>

904
00:40:29.641 --> 00:40:31.360
<v Speaker 1>meters and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'll actually,</v>

905
00:40:31.361 --> 00:40:33.760
<v Speaker 1>I laid this out just for now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just tell it how it went.</v>

906
00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:37.240
<v Speaker 1>And I pulled the gun out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I yelled at her again like that.</v>

907
00:40:37.241 --> 00:40:39.280
<v Speaker 1>She stopped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she did a big swipe on the ground,</v>

908
00:40:39.281 --> 00:40:41.520
<v Speaker 1>spun and went straight back to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>login.</v>

909
00:40:41.870 --> 00:40:44.860
<v Speaker 1>See soon as she got back to the cob,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this time she rented a side load,</v>

910
00:40:44.890 --> 00:40:45.930
<v Speaker 1>tried to flank me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

911
00:40:46.570 --> 00:40:48.940
<v Speaker 1>it freaks me out how fast these things </v>
<v Speaker 1>can move.</v>

912
00:40:48.941 --> 00:40:53.941
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you've seen our foster dad can get </v>

913
00:40:53.941 --> 00:40:54.570
<v Speaker 1>off the mark I and agrees leads faster </v>
<v Speaker 1>than the D or.</v>

914
00:40:54.571 --> 00:40:59.571
<v Speaker 1>And you think of the size of a grizzly </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it can still move at the speed of a </v>

915
00:40:59.571 --> 00:40:59.700
<v Speaker 1>deer or faster.</v>

916
00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:01.600
<v Speaker 1>Like in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She just disappears into this.</v>

917
00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:03.610
<v Speaker 1>There's all this scrub beside me I can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>see.</v>

918
00:41:03.611 --> 00:41:07.120
<v Speaker 1>So I'm like standing there like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like just white and where's she going to</v>

919
00:41:07.121 --> 00:41:12.121
<v Speaker 1>pop out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I fought the third time she's </v>

920
00:41:12.121 --> 00:41:12.121
<v Speaker 1>going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she ain't fucking around.</v>

921
00:41:12.121 --> 00:41:15.470
<v Speaker 1>She's going to try and kill me the third</v>
<v Speaker 1>time she never showed up and I stayed </v>

922
00:41:15.521 --> 00:41:17.800
<v Speaker 1>there for a little while and just start </v>
<v Speaker 1>backing up.</v>

923
00:41:18.010 --> 00:41:23.010
<v Speaker 1>And that's what I've got the camera out </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the other thing I'm fearful of </v>

924
00:41:23.010 --> 00:41:27.330
<v Speaker 1>is shooting one and not being able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>justify it because you people go to </v>

925
00:41:27.330 --> 00:41:27.440
<v Speaker 1>jail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get massive fall.</v>

926
00:41:27.441 --> 00:41:29.020
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all want a document?</v>

927
00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:32.500
<v Speaker 1>They started telling that she's coming </v>
<v Speaker 1>album probably gonna pull the trigger.</v>

928
00:41:32.501 --> 00:41:35.420
<v Speaker 1>I want to document it anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I back out.</v>

929
00:41:35.690 --> 00:41:39.110
<v Speaker 1>She sort stalks along a little bit like </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching me and stuff like that.</v>

930
00:41:39.111 --> 00:41:44.090
<v Speaker 1>Then she disappears and I walk away and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then I realized the guns jammed.</v>

931
00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:47.690
<v Speaker 1>The gun's been in that whole time and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

932
00:41:48.170 --> 00:41:50.060
<v Speaker 1>let's say shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she did come for me,</v>

933
00:41:50.061 --> 00:41:55.061
<v Speaker 1>like truly come from me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was fucked like there was no doubt </v>

934
00:41:55.061 --> 00:41:57.791
<v Speaker 1>about what was going on in those hollow </v>
<v Speaker 1>points with the flat face and I'm </v>

935
00:41:57.791 --> 00:41:58.100
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't load up into the chamber of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>gun.</v>

936
00:41:58.101 --> 00:42:02.090
<v Speaker 1>They hit on the throat of the revolver </v>
<v Speaker 1>and won't go up in there.</v>

937
00:42:02.450 --> 00:42:04.620
<v Speaker 1>So you'd never would have gotten off a </v>
<v Speaker 1>shot.</v>

938
00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:06.290
<v Speaker 1>I would never would have gotten off a </v>
<v Speaker 1>shot.</v>

939
00:42:07.070 --> 00:42:09.980
<v Speaker 1>And then I was thinking when the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>that she to 10 meters,</v>

940
00:42:09.981 --> 00:42:14.981
<v Speaker 1>because I thought she was going to jump </v>
<v Speaker 1>me it when she come that time and I was </v>

941
00:42:14.981 --> 00:42:14.981
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

942
00:42:14.981 --> 00:42:16.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm surprised the gun didn't go off </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm sure I had the finger on the</v>

943
00:42:16.851 --> 00:42:21.851
<v Speaker 1>trigger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I just remember thinking white and </v>

944
00:42:21.851 --> 00:42:24.641
<v Speaker 1>it happened that fast that I reckon that</v>
<v Speaker 1>second time she come at me when she was </v>

945
00:42:24.641 --> 00:42:25.610
<v Speaker 1>about the 12 or 11 made them.</v>

946
00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:30.670
<v Speaker 1>Or even when she just come past the </v>
<v Speaker 1>original mark that she stopped at 20 </v>

947
00:42:30.670 --> 00:42:34.121
<v Speaker 1>meters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I reckon I pulled the trigger and it </v>

948
00:42:34.121 --> 00:42:35.801
<v Speaker 1>didn't go off and I kept thinking like </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a slide lock on the gun and I </v>

949
00:42:36.561 --> 00:42:38.660
<v Speaker 1>kept thinking that was jammed up and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't at all.</v>

950
00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:41.030
<v Speaker 1>Those bullets just didn't fit in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>gun fit in there.</v>

951
00:42:41.330 --> 00:42:46.330
<v Speaker 1>So you never practiced with them at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he entire time you were unarmed yet </v>

952
00:42:46.330 --> 00:42:46.330
<v Speaker 1>tire time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was unarmed.</v>

953
00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:50.330
<v Speaker 1>I bought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bought bear spray from Cabela's.</v>

954
00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.940
<v Speaker 1>This man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like the world was fucking out to</v>

955
00:42:52.941 --> 00:42:56.360
<v Speaker 1>get me a bought bear spray from Cabela's</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's on the audit and the light.</v>

956
00:42:56.361 --> 00:42:59.810
<v Speaker 1>He didn't put in the bag and I got up </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and unpack the bags on luck.</v>

957
00:42:59.820 --> 00:43:01.310
<v Speaker 1>Where's the bear spray?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

958
00:43:01.311 --> 00:43:04.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know the bear spray might.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was able to.</v>

959
00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:07.310
<v Speaker 1>When she was all me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I even had this chance,</v>

960
00:43:07.311 --> 00:43:12.311
<v Speaker 1>I was ever going to pull an arrow out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ball and just try and stab her or </v>

961
00:43:12.311 --> 00:43:15.230
<v Speaker 1>auto or do you lie dead and cop it or </v>
<v Speaker 1>what they say with a female grizzly just</v>

962
00:43:15.231 --> 00:43:20.231
<v Speaker 1>try to lay dead because they're just </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to eliminate a threat to the </v>

963
00:43:20.231 --> 00:43:21.280
<v Speaker 1>cubs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it'd be really hard to lie.</v>

964
00:43:21.281 --> 00:43:22.940
<v Speaker 1>Did when something scratching your </v>
<v Speaker 1>heart,</v>

965
00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:26.600
<v Speaker 1>I feel like just the instinct to try and</v>
<v Speaker 1>go back at it,</v>

966
00:43:26.601 --> 00:43:28.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're so goddamn powerful.</v>

967
00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:30.710
<v Speaker 1>So that happened and then I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

968
00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:32.360
<v Speaker 1>Like I've got to hike out of there </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>

969
00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:34.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm unarmed so I've got to hike out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

970
00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:39.670
<v Speaker 1>I've got to get bullets from somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A Muslim guy back to the fucking bad </v>

971
00:43:39.670 --> 00:43:39.950
<v Speaker 1>grizzly spot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

972
00:43:39.951 --> 00:43:43.520
<v Speaker 1>Which at least I know there's elk there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've been trying to not do it.</v>

973
00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:45.950
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What caliber gun is this point?</v>

974
00:43:45.951 --> 00:43:47.180
<v Speaker 1>40th five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

975
00:43:47.181 --> 00:43:48.440
<v Speaker 1>So it's a good gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

976
00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:51.470
<v Speaker 1>But the drama started way before then </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm like,</v>

977
00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:56.500
<v Speaker 1>if I'm going to do these hung,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to have someone with me like a </v>

978
00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:59.411
<v Speaker 1>hunting buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to do that one solo </v>

979
00:43:59.411 --> 00:43:59.411
<v Speaker 1>anymore because of the grids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the grizzlies.</v>

980
00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:01.910
<v Speaker 1>And so I invited Shane Dorian here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Buddy Shane.</v>

981
00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:07.660
<v Speaker 1>He was common and then the tags in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Montana got really hard to get so he </v>

982
00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:09.230
<v Speaker 1>couldn't get a tag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I was going to have drama,</v>

983
00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:11.870
<v Speaker 1>film the hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I found that like couldn't film in a</v>

984
00:44:11.871 --> 00:44:14.870
<v Speaker 1>wilderness area so they couldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and I'm just like,</v>

985
00:44:14.871 --> 00:44:19.871
<v Speaker 1>I'm just destined to go there by myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was like I already knew some shit</v>

986
00:44:20.121 --> 00:44:21.250
<v Speaker 1>was going to go down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

987
00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:23.240
<v Speaker 1>It was like everything kept pushing me </v>
<v Speaker 1>in that direction.</v>

988
00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:25.010
<v Speaker 1>Now I go back to Montana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll be right.</v>

989
00:44:25.250 --> 00:44:26.860
<v Speaker 1>You know you're going to encounter </v>
<v Speaker 1>grizzly.</v>

990
00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:29.390
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So put this thing in front of your face.</v>

991
00:44:29.391 --> 00:44:30.560
<v Speaker 1>Don't put it by your neck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>

992
00:44:30.650 --> 00:44:31.980
<v Speaker 1>Hello.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Much better.</v>

993
00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:38.120
<v Speaker 1>I think I might've been like this when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>started the show and now I've just come </v>

994
00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:38.700
<v Speaker 1>back and you freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's going on.</v>

995
00:44:38.790 --> 00:44:43.790
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm trying to get told because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about grizzlies and getting </v>

996
00:44:44.251 --> 00:44:46.290
<v Speaker 1>goosebumps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just hearing you talk.</v>

997
00:44:46.291 --> 00:44:47.930

<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

998

<v Speaker 1>and it was just not ever attack or </v>

00:44:55.351 --> 00:44:58.710
<v Speaker 1>all them feelings rush back to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it was like I had a full adrenaline</v>

<v Speaker 1>until the point I was starting to feel </v>

1003
00:45:05.180 --> 00:45:05.490
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking what's going on.</v>

<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

1007
00:45:11.210 --> 00:45:12.540
<v Speaker 1>I could see her as clear as die still </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming at me.</v>

1008
00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:14.850
<v Speaker 1>I remember saying a shoulder's moving </v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

1009

<v Speaker 3>Non Kodiak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A fog neck.</v>

00:45:41.130 --> 00:45:43.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is why saying grammy's videos.</v>

1017
00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:44.150

<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1019
00:45:45.650 --> 00:45:50.650
<v Speaker 3>they just did a podcast on to podcasts </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a row and they shot an elk and the </v>

1020
00:45:52.070 --> 00:45:53.840
<v Speaker 3>fog neck islands,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have roosevelt elk,</v>

1021
00:45:53.841 --> 00:45:58.841
<v Speaker 3>which is a very large elk and deer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The biggest roosevelt elk is a huge </v>

1022
00:45:58.841 --> 00:46:02.051
<v Speaker 3>animal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like 1400 pound animal and it's crazy </v>

1023
00:46:02.051 --> 00:46:02.630
<v Speaker 3>thick brush and they're packing this </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing out.</v>

1024
00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:03.410

<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1025
00:46:03.730 --> 00:46:06.860
<v Speaker 3>So they shot it when they left some of </v>
<v Speaker 3>it there,</v>

1026
00:46:07.100 --> 00:46:12.100
<v Speaker 3>they went back to go get the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the elk and Grizzly bear had obviously </v>

1027
00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:15.830
<v Speaker 3>claimed they didn't know they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>hanging around eating sandwiches.</v>

1028
00:46:15.831 --> 00:46:20.831
<v Speaker 3>They didn't have their guns out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing in the bear just came running </v>

1029
00:46:20.831 --> 00:46:20.831
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just charged into all of them.</v>

1030
00:46:21.050 --> 00:46:26.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm one of the guys a dartmouth wound up</v>
<v Speaker 3>riding on the back of the bear is a </v>

1031
00:46:28.380 --> 00:46:30.330
<v Speaker 3>fucking crazy story and they're talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>

1032
00:46:30.370 --> 00:46:31.760
<v Speaker 3>Just a giant bear,</v>

1033
00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:35.060
<v Speaker 1>10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>11 foot grizzly bear this,</v>

1034
00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:36.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when people like,</v>

1035
00:46:36.791 --> 00:46:38.410
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you believe in big foot or.</v>

1036
00:46:38.411 --> 00:46:40.630
<v Speaker 1>And stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't fucking have to.</v>

1037
00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:44.080
<v Speaker 1>There's a real live monster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we just used to say it.</v>

1038
00:46:44.110 --> 00:46:47.290
<v Speaker 1>We call it a grizzly bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It fucking can eat.</v>

1039
00:46:47.291 --> 00:46:48.940
<v Speaker 1>You owe it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eats everything.</v>

1040
00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:50.920
<v Speaker 1>It eats everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just savage</v>

1041
00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:55.940
<v Speaker 3>do so big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think people understand how big </v>

1042
00:46:55.940 --> 00:46:59.021
<v Speaker 3>they are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't seen a big one in the US in </v>

1043
00:46:59.021 --> 00:47:03.251
<v Speaker 3>the wild,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I saw a small one in Alberta in the </v>

1044
00:47:03.251 --> 00:47:03.251
<v Speaker 3>wild and it scared the shit out of me.</v>

1045
00:47:03.251 --> 00:47:06.270
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one that was on my mile carcass last</v>

1046
00:47:06.270 --> 00:47:08.280
<v Speaker 1>year and we spoke about it in last </v>
<v Speaker 1>year's podcasts.</v>

1047
00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:13.520
<v Speaker 1>I remember thinking it's faith is bigger</v>
<v Speaker 1>than my whole torso do and I'm just like</v>

1048
00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:16.470
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that should be mythical,</v>

1049
00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:19.710
<v Speaker 1>but it's fucking not living here right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

1050
00:47:21.050 --> 00:47:23.750
<v Speaker 1>And there's states that are protecting </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1051
00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:26.120
<v Speaker 1>Like Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1052
00:47:26.130 --> 00:47:28.650
<v Speaker 1>They want to control the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to help the populations grow.</v>

1053
00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:30.160
<v Speaker 1>I think vote would change</v>

1054
00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:32.770
<v Speaker 2>really quickly about protecting them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even felt fucking night.</v>

1055
00:47:32.771 --> 00:47:35.160
<v Speaker 2>You dog will one of your kids or trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to date you.</v>

1056
00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:40.660
<v Speaker 2>I think people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be very hard to get people to </v>

1057
00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:40.660
<v Speaker 2>vote if it killed a dog because people </v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

1058
00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:41.980
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know they were here first.</v>

1059
00:47:43.180 --> 00:47:47.410
<v Speaker 2>It's when they start getting into you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our friends up in Alberta,</v>

1060
00:47:47.830 --> 00:47:52.830
<v Speaker 2>John and Jen Rivet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they sent me some pictures recently of </v>

1061
00:47:52.830 --> 00:47:54.670
<v Speaker 2>some bears that had moved into the area </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they've been pushed out of their</v>

1062
00:47:54.671 --> 00:47:56.230
<v Speaker 2>good area by grizzlies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1063
00:47:56.310 --> 00:48:01.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of grizzlies grizzlies up </v>

1064
00:48:01.310 --> 00:48:03.451
<v Speaker 2>there and apparently the talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>having some sort of a season on them </v>

1065
00:48:03.451 --> 00:48:06.070
<v Speaker 2>because people are encountering them on </v>
<v Speaker 2>a more frequent basis,</v>

1066
00:48:06.071 --> 00:48:11.071
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that area where they live up in Alberta </v>

1067
00:48:11.071 --> 00:48:13.831
<v Speaker 2>is just so dense and it's so dense that </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to figure out how many bears are </v>

1068
00:48:14.621 --> 00:48:16.000
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the bears are,</v>

1069
00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:17.500
<v Speaker 2>so that's a good system.</v>

1070
00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:20.830
<v Speaker 2>When I put that time and effort in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fine and the numbers like this,</v>

1071
00:48:20.831 --> 00:48:25.831
<v Speaker 2>why the American system is the best </v>
<v Speaker 2>hunting system I've ever come across </v>

1072
00:48:25.831 --> 00:48:29.700
<v Speaker 2>because we saw you doing numbers check </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you release the tags for what </v>

1073
00:48:31.061 --> 00:48:34.570
<v Speaker 2>can be taken out of the population to </v>
<v Speaker 2>keep the population healthy.</v>

1074
00:48:34.571 --> 00:48:39.571
<v Speaker 2>Student.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all done by wildlife is a hyper </v>

1075
00:48:39.571 --> 00:48:40.240
<v Speaker 2>revenue there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an awesome system.</v>

1076
00:48:40.730 --> 00:48:45.730
<v Speaker 2>Well billions of dollars a year from </v>
<v Speaker 2>hunting revenue in this country that go </v>

1077
00:48:45.730 --> 00:48:49.030
<v Speaker 2>to wildlife preservation that go to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservation of habitat.</v>

1078
00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:54.060
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back country hunters and anglers has a </v>

1079
00:48:54.060 --> 00:48:54.060
<v Speaker 2>great website where all this stuff is </v>
<v Speaker 2>detailed.</v>

1080
00:48:54.060 --> 00:48:56.080
<v Speaker 2>Making Rocky Mountain Health Federation </v>
<v Speaker 2>does a same similar thing.</v>

1081
00:48:56.410 --> 00:49:01.410
<v Speaker 2>It's just they have decreased the </v>
<v Speaker 2>detailed numbers on how much money goes </v>

1082
00:49:01.410 --> 00:49:05.821
<v Speaker 2>into conserving these areas and even </v>
<v Speaker 2>repopulating these animals into other </v>

1083
00:49:05.821 --> 00:49:05.821
<v Speaker 2>areas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1084
00:49:05.821 --> 00:49:07.440
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a brilliant system so it,</v>

1085
00:49:07.470 --> 00:49:07.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and.</v>

1086
00:49:08.100 --> 00:49:13.100
<v Speaker 2>But it has to be that two sides because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't go fully one while fully the </v>

1087
00:49:13.100 --> 00:49:16.480
<v Speaker 2>Avo because if it goes fully one way and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've tried frigging wipe amount,</v>

1088
00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:21.540
<v Speaker 2>no one wants that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's got to be that middle ground </v>

1089
00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:22.570
<v Speaker 2>there where I think what wayside of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>greenies fought for as well,</v>

1090
00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:23.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it's like,</v>

1091
00:49:23.801 --> 00:49:28.801
<v Speaker 2>well we know we can afford the shoot 200</v>
<v Speaker 2>of those grizzly bears out of the 10,000</v>

1092
00:49:30.061 --> 00:49:32.230
<v Speaker 2>that live there or whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy numbers.</v>

1093
00:49:32.830 --> 00:49:37.830
<v Speaker 2>Then that's the system we want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's healthy populations or game </v>

1094
00:49:37.830 --> 00:49:41.791
<v Speaker 2>every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every single year for generations to </v>

1095
00:49:41.791 --> 00:49:44.191
<v Speaker 2>come.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Healthy populations of game and making </v>

1096
00:49:44.191 --> 00:49:44.680
<v Speaker 2>sure that these giant predators don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>encroach on civilization.</v>

1097
00:49:44.681 --> 00:49:45.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing.</v>

1098
00:49:45.491 --> 00:49:48.640
<v Speaker 2>It's like keeping them out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once they start wiping out all the moose</v>

1099
00:49:48.641 --> 00:49:53.641
<v Speaker 2>and all the deer and all the elk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're gonna move towards people like </v>

1100
00:49:53.641 --> 00:49:55.060
<v Speaker 2>people need to understand that this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>not a game.</v>

1101
00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:57.790
<v Speaker 2>You don't encounter them in Santa </v>
<v Speaker 2>Monica.</v>

1102
00:49:57.791 --> 00:49:58.090
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1103
00:49:58.300 --> 00:49:59.130
<v Speaker 2>So people like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1104
00:49:59.131 --> 00:50:01.060
<v Speaker 2>you asshole was just going to kill the </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals.</v>

1105
00:50:01.420 --> 00:50:03.460
<v Speaker 2>That's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not what these people are doing.</v>

1106
00:50:03.490 --> 00:50:04.810
<v Speaker 2>You don't understand you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Exactly.</v>

1107
00:50:04.811 --> 00:50:09.811
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you could tell them maybe if they </v>

1108
00:50:09.811 --> 00:50:12.930
<v Speaker 2>maybe they've heard you like be around </v>
<v Speaker 2>them and understand what the fuck this </v>

1109
00:50:12.930 --> 00:50:15.220
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Giant 1500 pound monster.</v>

1110
00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:20.520
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't think like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh that dude that I'm going to eight </v>

1111
00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:20.520
<v Speaker 2>might have kids.</v>

1112
00:50:22.740 --> 00:50:27.200
<v Speaker 2>They just thinking food hall in me </v>
<v Speaker 2>stomach and don't want to fill up.</v>

1113
00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:28.190
<v Speaker 2>The greenies would say,</v>

1114
00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:30.820
<v Speaker 1>well that elk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you killed those kids to math.</v>

1115
00:50:31.030 --> 00:50:36.030
<v Speaker 1>Why these greenies out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're petitioning against fucking </v>

1116
00:50:36.030 --> 00:50:37.790
<v Speaker 1>lions killing shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why aren't they?</v>

1117
00:50:37.791 --> 00:50:38.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1118
00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:40.400
<v Speaker 1>Why aren't low like lines are killing </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

1119
00:50:40.430 --> 00:50:42.830
<v Speaker 1>We were just talking about just part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the food chain as well.</v>

1120
00:50:42.831 --> 00:50:44.510
<v Speaker 1>Do we are part of this whole system.</v>

1121
00:50:44.570 --> 00:50:47.360
<v Speaker 3>Courtney do alter on the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was talking to her about,</v>

1122
00:50:47.420 --> 00:50:49.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people occasionally when they're running</v>

1123
00:50:49.401 --> 00:50:50.720
<v Speaker 3>these trails.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We running the mountain lions.</v>

1124
00:50:50.721 --> 00:50:53.270
<v Speaker 3>We were talking about this lady who </v>
<v Speaker 3>lives in Malibu,</v>

1125
00:50:53.271 --> 00:50:55.370
<v Speaker 3>has an Alpaca farm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a mountain lion,</v>

1126
00:50:55.371 --> 00:51:00.371
<v Speaker 3>got Intel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pacos killed 11 of them and a goat just </v>

1127
00:51:00.371 --> 00:51:01.170
<v Speaker 3>wiped them out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just fucking decimated the PO.</v>

1128
00:51:01.730 --> 00:51:06.730
<v Speaker 3>That was fruit killing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so this lady got a depredation </v>

1129
00:51:06.730 --> 00:51:08.270
<v Speaker 3>permit to kill them out and she got all </v>
<v Speaker 3>these death threats from people.</v>

1130
00:51:08.300 --> 00:51:09.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1131
00:51:09.410 --> 00:51:12.110
<v Speaker 3>But it's always like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you understand that this now mine,</v>

1132
00:51:12.130 --> 00:51:13.430
<v Speaker 3>it's killing animals too.</v>

1133
00:51:13.540 --> 00:51:13.990
<v Speaker 1>Two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1134
00:51:13.991 --> 00:51:14.410
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1135
00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:18.040
<v Speaker 1>Way more animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can understand it.</v>

1136
00:51:18.110 --> 00:51:19.130
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not logical.</v>

1137
00:51:19.131 --> 00:51:23.300
<v Speaker 3>It's just emotional and I think a big </v>
<v Speaker 3>part of the problem with two,</v>

1138
00:51:23.330 --> 00:51:25.100
<v Speaker 3>there's two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two parts of the problem.</v>

1139
00:51:25.101 --> 00:51:28.610
<v Speaker 3>One,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lack of real wilderness exposure,</v>

1140
00:51:28.970 --> 00:51:33.970
<v Speaker 3>like real time in the woods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding what this whole ecosystem </v>

1141
00:51:33.970 --> 00:51:36.020
<v Speaker 3>is really all about because it's just a </v>
<v Speaker 3>Predator prey ecosystem.</v>

1142
00:51:36.410 --> 00:51:41.410
<v Speaker 3>And when a hunter goes into that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you really just dipping your toes into </v>

1143
00:51:41.410 --> 00:51:41.510
<v Speaker 3>the wild world a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1144
00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:43.880
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then the other part of it is movies,</v>

1145
00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:47.600
<v Speaker 3>all these fucking bear movies where the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bears are your friends,</v>

1146
00:51:47.601 --> 00:51:52.601
<v Speaker 3>they talk to each other and all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>anthropomorphized anthropomorphization </v>

1147
00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:55.690
<v Speaker 3>movies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's Bambi or whether it.</v>

1148
00:51:57.760 --> 00:52:00.470
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if you go out into the woods and</v>
<v Speaker 1>see yourself,</v>

1149
00:52:00.530 --> 00:52:05.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a much better understanding and a </v>

1150
00:52:05.530 --> 00:52:07.691
<v Speaker 1>much better experience for the more </v>
<v Speaker 1>people get exposed to these movies with </v>

1151
00:52:07.691 --> 00:52:12.110
<v Speaker 1>bears talk and they're your buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then get exposed to an actual charge.</v>

1152
00:52:12.550 --> 00:52:14.490
<v Speaker 1>Fucking Mama grizzly bear like you did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1153
00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:15.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

1154
00:52:15.450 --> 00:52:18.180
<v Speaker 1>He wants to kill those payments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A wipe.</v>

1155
00:52:18.330 --> 00:52:20.310
<v Speaker 1>I didn't look at that mother grizzly and</v>
<v Speaker 1>be like,</v>

1156
00:52:20.340 --> 00:52:22.160
<v Speaker 1>I want to shoot you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the video,</v>

1157
00:52:22.161 --> 00:52:27.161
<v Speaker 1>you'll actually hear me gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really don't want to shoot this bear </v>

1158
00:52:27.161 --> 00:52:27.500
<v Speaker 1>like she's just doing what her instinct </v>
<v Speaker 1>tells her.</v>

1159
00:52:27.550 --> 00:52:29.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even cranky Adot,</v>

1160
00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:33.830
<v Speaker 1>but I don't want to fucking die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's a terrible way to die too.</v>

1161
00:52:33.890 --> 00:52:36.560
<v Speaker 1>That'd be a horrible way to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A jaw.</v>

1162
00:52:36.570 --> 00:52:41.180
<v Speaker 1>The size of this table closing down on </v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't be good.</v>

1163
00:52:43.010 --> 00:52:43.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1164
00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:48.400
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to open up a season </v>

1165
00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:48.950
<v Speaker 1>apparently on them near near yellowstone</v>
<v Speaker 1>to many situations.</v>

1166
00:52:49.170 --> 00:52:50.600
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bears.</v>

1167
00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:55.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's roughly the area that on the air </v>

1168
00:52:55.720 --> 00:52:55.910
<v Speaker 1>and that's where they released a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem bears too.</v>

1169
00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:57.260
<v Speaker 1>That's what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1170
00:52:57.970 --> 00:53:00.510
<v Speaker 1>So I went to an area that they didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>release problem.</v>

1171
00:53:00.520 --> 00:53:05.520
<v Speaker 1>There's no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I'd never say a female grizzly </v>

1172
00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:08.501
<v Speaker 1>where I usually hunt in Montana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were old miles or loan animals at </v>

1173
00:53:08.501 --> 00:53:08.501
<v Speaker 1>least.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I can't tell.</v>

1174
00:53:08.501 --> 00:53:10.210
<v Speaker 1>And the males are less likely to charge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1175
00:53:10.220 --> 00:53:11.750
<v Speaker 1>it seems like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1176
00:53:11.751 --> 00:53:16.751
<v Speaker 1>it seems like the males.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well if a male charged you is to eat </v>

1177
00:53:16.751 --> 00:53:16.751
<v Speaker 1>you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1178
00:53:16.751 --> 00:53:21.110
<v Speaker 1>Because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yelled at that one on my car last year </v>

1179
00:53:21.110 --> 00:53:21.110
<v Speaker 1>and he wanted to go to the apple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why he,</v>

1180
00:53:21.110 --> 00:53:25.490
<v Speaker 1>he ran off and frequent disappeared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's interesting because Montana </v>

1181
00:53:25.490 --> 00:53:28.781
<v Speaker 1>does not have a bear season,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so these are not animals like Alaska </v>

1182
00:53:28.781 --> 00:53:29.310
<v Speaker 1>bears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Avoid people like the play.</v>

1183
00:53:29.340 --> 00:53:30.110
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

1184
00:53:30.170 --> 00:53:31.980
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they're afraid of being shot.</v>

1185
00:53:32.070 --> 00:53:33.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he like ran off.</v>

1186
00:53:33.361 --> 00:53:37.560
<v Speaker 1>I think I only yelled at oil to him that</v>
<v Speaker 1>one last year and he disappeared.</v>

1187
00:53:37.860 --> 00:53:42.860
<v Speaker 1>This female grizzly that was running it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I was calling her a fucking mall </v>

1188
00:53:42.860 --> 00:53:44.460
<v Speaker 1>and everything might shake a mall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the mall?</v>

1189
00:53:44.490 --> 00:53:46.080
<v Speaker 1>I knew that was an Australian word.</v>

1190
00:53:49.210 --> 00:53:54.210
<v Speaker 1>So me and my buddy Andrew Boucles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who I've just spent last week with him </v>

1191
00:53:54.210 --> 00:53:57.040
<v Speaker 1>in Arnhem land in northern territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He come,</v>

1192
00:53:57.540 --> 00:54:02.540
<v Speaker 1>you'd just be sitting in the vehicle </v>
<v Speaker 1>driving along and it's all quiet and </v>

1193
00:54:02.540 --> 00:54:02.640
<v Speaker 1>peaceful and then he would just come up </v>
<v Speaker 1>with something weird like,</v>

1194
00:54:02.930 --> 00:54:03.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

1195
00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:08.760
<v Speaker 1>if you had to bring any active back from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dead to hunt with you for a week,</v>

1196
00:54:08.761 --> 00:54:12.900
<v Speaker 1>who would have been fuck honeys and </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to think about that.</v>

1197
00:54:13.260 --> 00:54:15.660
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I can't have one because I'm like,</v>

1198
00:54:15.661 --> 00:54:20.661
<v Speaker 1>he's coming up with all this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to call it one of them over </v>

1199
00:54:20.661 --> 00:54:23.481
<v Speaker 1>this trip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just need to come up with real </v>

1200
00:54:23.481 --> 00:54:26.211
<v Speaker 1>Australian things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sayings that aren't getting used </v>

1201
00:54:26.211 --> 00:54:26.211
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And mine was like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking get blank stares.</v>

1205
00:54:33.210 --> 00:54:35.520
<v Speaker 1>Like a magician would say 10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

00:54:43.100 --> 00:54:43.940
<v Speaker 1>bye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1211
00:54:44.050 --> 00:54:45.840
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Raise like victory.</v>

1212
00:54:45.910 --> 00:54:50.910
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well Mall is like I'm calling someone a </v>

1213
00:54:52.081 --> 00:54:54.530
<v Speaker 1>bitch or a skank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A mall.</v>

1214
00:54:54.570 --> 00:54:55.860
<v Speaker 1>You've got skank?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1215
00:54:55.950 --> 00:54:57.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1216
00:54:57.180 --> 00:55:02.180
<v Speaker 1>So she's running at me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like fucking ease up your fucking </v>

1217
00:55:02.180 --> 00:55:02.180
<v Speaker 1>mall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1218
00:55:02.180 --> 00:55:02.690
<v Speaker 1>And she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

1219
00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:04.750
<v Speaker 1>is this guy from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably why she didn't eat.</v>

1220
00:55:04.990 --> 00:55:06.870
<v Speaker 1>She was from here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She didn't even say this,</v>

1221
00:55:06.871 --> 00:55:08.820
<v Speaker 1>but I imagine she was thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't speak English.</v>

1222
00:55:09.970 --> 00:55:14.150
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't even know what a dummy reach </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1223
00:55:15.260 --> 00:55:16.930
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard of a mold before.</v>

1224
00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:19.670
<v Speaker 1>A mall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a mall of America.</v>

1225
00:55:19.671 --> 00:55:22.850
<v Speaker 1>M O l e like molly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get.</v>

1226
00:55:22.950 --> 00:55:27.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's more of like mall in </v>

1227
00:55:27.950 --> 00:55:27.950
<v Speaker 1>your face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1228
00:55:27.950 --> 00:55:28.680
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's brought all ll slang.</v>

1229
00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:31.710
<v Speaker 1>Slang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>term two different Australia,</v>

1230
00:55:31.740 --> 00:55:32.760
<v Speaker 1>Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Zealand.</v>

1231
00:55:32.790 --> 00:55:33.960
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the United States.</v>

1232
00:55:34.290 --> 00:55:39.290
<v Speaker 1>Usually a pejorative or self deprecating</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a woman of loose sexual morals.</v>

1233
00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:40.170
<v Speaker 1>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitch.</v>

1234
00:55:40.171 --> 00:55:43.080
<v Speaker 1>I said big slot or a prostitute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Damn,</v>

1235
00:55:43.081 --> 00:55:44.830
<v Speaker 1>no wonder she was pissed off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1236
00:55:45.510 --> 00:55:50.510
<v Speaker 1>Mall Mall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's probably like some old shit from </v>

1237
00:55:50.510 --> 00:55:52.140
<v Speaker 1>America that we like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We gave to you long time ago.</v>

1238
00:55:52.230 --> 00:55:57.230
<v Speaker 1>We abandoned it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you guys picked it up probably </v>

1239
00:55:57.230 --> 00:56:01.510
<v Speaker 1>probably so when you went and got boats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she went and got bullets for the Fed and</v>

1240
00:56:01.511 --> 00:56:06.511
<v Speaker 1>I went and bought bullets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jump Straight back into Montana but me </v>

1241
00:56:06.511 --> 00:56:07.770
<v Speaker 1>old spot in Montana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then um,</v>

1242
00:56:08.170 --> 00:56:11.590
<v Speaker 1>I only had three days at that point to </v>
<v Speaker 1>try and cause,</v>

1243
00:56:11.591 --> 00:56:16.591
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was after a bull elk and I'd passed </v>

1244
00:56:16.591 --> 00:56:17.280
<v Speaker 1>up a lot of younger animals and like </v>
<v Speaker 1>immature animals over that time.</v>

1245
00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:22.880
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went from the hot heat to got to my </v>

1246
00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:25.140
<v Speaker 1>usual spot in Montana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And why out that was.</v>

1247
00:56:25.150 --> 00:56:25.420
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1248
00:56:25.850 --> 00:56:28.660
<v Speaker 3>Explain that for people that aren't </v>
<v Speaker 3>hunters is.</v>

1249
00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:33.680
<v Speaker 3>It is very important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you want to consider the overall </v>

1250
00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:36.071
<v Speaker 3>health of the herd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you always want to shoot the older </v>

1251
00:56:36.071 --> 00:56:36.071
<v Speaker 3>mature animals because those are the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ones that are bred.</v>

1252
00:56:36.390 --> 00:56:41.390
<v Speaker 3>They've passed on their genetics and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>also improves the health of the herd </v>

1253
00:56:41.390 --> 00:56:43.100
<v Speaker 3>because then the younger males.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

1254
00:56:43.110 --> 00:56:48.110
<v Speaker 3>I would probably get killed by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bigger males or have the potential </v>

1255
00:56:48.110 --> 00:56:48.800
<v Speaker 3>getting killed in combat when they </v>
<v Speaker 3>clashed.</v>

1256
00:56:48.950 --> 00:56:53.950
<v Speaker 3>And that's the whole reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If people don't know why they have </v>

1257
00:56:53.950 --> 00:56:53.950
<v Speaker 3>antlers</v>

1258
00:56:53.950 --> 00:56:53.950
<v Speaker 1>finding it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1259
00:56:53.950 --> 00:56:53.950
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

1260
00:56:53.950 --> 00:56:58.290
<v Speaker 1>I think my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my biggest thought in that is I just </v>

1261
00:56:58.290 --> 00:56:59.140
<v Speaker 1>want to shoot an animal that's lived its</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

1262
00:57:00.330 --> 00:57:00.880
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1263
00:57:00.881 --> 00:57:02.620
<v Speaker 1>if I'm desperate for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't get me wrong,</v>

1264
00:57:02.621 --> 00:57:07.621
<v Speaker 1>I'll shoot a spike or a cow or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not desperate for meat.</v>

1265
00:57:07.781 --> 00:57:09.730
<v Speaker 1>And that point of survival,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1266
00:57:09.731 --> 00:57:14.731
<v Speaker 1>so I just feel a lot better if I shoot </v>
<v Speaker 1>an animal that unlike it's lived its </v>

1267
00:57:14.731 --> 00:57:14.731
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1268
00:57:14.740 --> 00:57:18.370
<v Speaker 1>And then the byproduct of that is you </v>
<v Speaker 1>get a bigger animal,</v>

1269
00:57:18.430 --> 00:57:20.020
<v Speaker 1>so more meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1270
00:57:20.021 --> 00:57:23.020
<v Speaker 1>you get a set of antlers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to me a memory.</v>

1271
00:57:23.021 --> 00:57:28.021
<v Speaker 1>It's not like about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't cut the head off and just walk </v>

1272
00:57:28.021 --> 00:57:28.021
<v Speaker 1>out at the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1273
00:57:28.021 --> 00:57:31.440
<v Speaker 1>I've got a trophy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think a lot of people think that </v>

1274
00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:31.730
<v Speaker 1>for me it's a yf respect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just,</v>

1275
00:57:31.770 --> 00:57:33.700
<v Speaker 1>it's a way of respecting the animal to </v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

1276
00:57:34.270 --> 00:57:35.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's,</v>

1277
00:57:35.901 --> 00:57:36.670
<v Speaker 1>it's a funny thing.</v>

1278
00:57:36.670 --> 00:57:38.140
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just shooting a big old,</v>

1279
00:57:38.350 --> 00:57:43.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's why I passed a lot of lot of </v>

1280
00:57:43.350 --> 00:57:45.540
<v Speaker 1>young animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had opportunities that was one dials </v>

1281
00:57:45.540 --> 00:57:45.540
<v Speaker 1>rod on the edge of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1282
00:57:45.540 --> 00:57:50.160
<v Speaker 1>like it's like a cliff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there was a rock that went out over </v>

1283
00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:52.861
<v Speaker 1>the cliff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a bit of a pinnacle and I was </v>

1284
00:57:52.861 --> 00:57:53.830
<v Speaker 1>actually on the pinnacle and I had this </v>
<v Speaker 1>bowl strike below me and he was like,</v>

1285
00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:59.160
<v Speaker 1>I think he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was 30 something made his butt </v>

1286
00:57:59.160 --> 00:57:59.160
<v Speaker 1>because you're shooting down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1287
00:57:59.160 --> 00:58:01.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the range finders science you to that 16</v>

1288
00:58:01.181 --> 00:58:04.060
<v Speaker 1>or 17 meters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was just lying there,</v>

1289
00:58:04.061 --> 00:58:06.400
<v Speaker 1>had no idea it was there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1290
00:58:06.820 --> 00:58:11.820
<v Speaker 1>but just a younger bull,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see it in his face and his body </v>

1291
00:58:11.820 --> 00:58:11.820
<v Speaker 1>and just these analysts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1292
00:58:11.820 --> 00:58:13.840
<v Speaker 1>But it felt good to be there and then be</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1293
00:58:13.841 --> 00:58:14.950
<v Speaker 1>Nah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And back out.</v>

1294
00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:17.950
<v Speaker 1>And then it was afternoon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that that Greasley went me,</v>

1295
00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:20.590
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had opportunities to shoot balls,</v>

1296
00:58:20.591 --> 00:58:24.400
<v Speaker 1>but I pretty much went 21 days without </v>
<v Speaker 1>an opportunity where I'm like,</v>

1297
00:58:24.820 --> 00:58:26.590
<v Speaker 1>this is the bullet I'm going to shoot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1298
00:58:26.591 --> 00:58:28.580
<v Speaker 1>and I'm getting into the zone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have this.</v>

1299
00:58:28.610 --> 00:58:30.460
<v Speaker 1>The thing that people I think</v>

1300
00:58:30.810 --> 00:58:35.810
<v Speaker 3>on the outside don't understand or </v>
<v Speaker 3>appreciate is that it's not just about </v>

1301
00:58:36.391 --> 00:58:41.391
<v Speaker 3>getting me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's also about getting a mature animal </v>

1302
00:58:41.391 --> 00:58:45.591
<v Speaker 3>and it's also about getting a mature </v>
<v Speaker 3>animal because they're way more </v>

1303
00:58:45.591 --> 00:58:45.591
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>

1304
00:58:45.591 --> 00:58:45.591
<v Speaker 1>Exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1305
00:58:45.591 --> 00:58:46.900
<v Speaker 1>They are way smarter and Bain for </v>
<v Speaker 1>seasons,</v>

1306
00:58:46.901 --> 00:58:48.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just heaps more switched on.</v>

1307
00:58:48.721 --> 00:58:50.190
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot smarter.</v>

1308
00:58:50.191 --> 00:58:52.590
<v Speaker 1>So you wanna let's like going into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

1309
00:58:52.591 --> 00:58:57.591
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't want to go into a fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>with someone that's never done </v>

1310
00:58:57.591 --> 00:58:59.010
<v Speaker 1>kickboxing and yoga champion kickboxer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like that's ridiculous.</v>

1311
00:58:59.011 --> 00:59:04.011
<v Speaker 1>Like where's the challenge in that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How are you going to be better at doing </v>

1312
00:59:04.011 --> 00:59:07.641
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're just fighting the fight that </v>

1313
00:59:07.641 --> 00:59:10.611
<v Speaker 1>you know you're always going to win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I say it very early in that </v>

1314
00:59:10.611 --> 00:59:12.030
<v Speaker 1>trip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy to go home without a ball,</v>

1315
00:59:12.450 --> 00:59:17.450
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not happy to give up on day </v>
<v Speaker 1>three or four or sit around camp and </v>

1316
00:59:17.450 --> 00:59:20.070
<v Speaker 1>then go home available.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to bust my ass,</v>

1317
00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:25.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to get to point where I say to </v>

1318
00:59:25.160 --> 00:59:27.341
<v Speaker 1>myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I did it multiple times on this </v>

1319
00:59:27.341 --> 00:59:27.341
<v Speaker 1>trip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you doing?</v>

1320
00:59:27.341 --> 00:59:27.860
<v Speaker 1>Like give up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is too hard,</v>

1321
00:59:27.861 --> 00:59:30.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to get to that point where myself</v>

1322
00:59:30.670 --> 00:59:33.050
<v Speaker 1>write down because I feel like that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the most you ever grow,</v>

1323
00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:36.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in any sort of hardship.</v>

1324
00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:41.080
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like freaking campaigns running </v>

1325
00:59:41.080 --> 00:59:41.080
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1326
00:59:41.080 --> 00:59:44.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's guest going to find a longer </v>

1327
00:59:44.890 --> 00:59:44.890
<v Speaker 1>marathon next time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's what courtney was saying,</v>

1328
00:59:44.890 --> 00:59:49.811
<v Speaker 1>that they're considering a 500 holly </v>
<v Speaker 1>block run 500.</v>

1329
00:59:51.850 --> 00:59:54.020
<v Speaker 1>I can't even fathom that dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1330
00:59:54.021 --> 00:59:55.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean how many days would that take?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1331
00:59:55.580 --> 00:59:59.660
<v Speaker 1>I can't even fathom going counting days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably like a week.</v>

1332
00:59:59.740 --> 01:00:01.160
<v Speaker 1>It's probably going to be a week of </v>
<v Speaker 1>running.</v>

1333
01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:02.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's just,</v>

1334
01:00:02.211 --> 01:00:03.560
<v Speaker 1>you always up in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1335
01:00:03.561 --> 01:00:06.020
<v Speaker 1>like I'll go to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to pull back a little bit now.</v>

1336
01:00:06.021 --> 01:00:09.550
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't like that's about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>maximum that all do.</v>

1337
01:00:10.850 --> 01:00:12.390
<v Speaker 1>Twenty to 22.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1338
01:00:12.860 --> 01:00:17.860
<v Speaker 1>And then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was a lot longer without the </v>

1339
01:00:17.860 --> 01:00:19.520
<v Speaker 1>family because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the flights here and the flights back.</v>

1340
01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:22.760
<v Speaker 1>And I went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was with Yeti and I went,</v>

1341
01:00:22.940 --> 01:00:27.940
<v Speaker 1>well I did the whole Yeti thing and went</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the innovation center and hung out </v>

1342
01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:29.060
<v Speaker 1>with Yeti for like a couple of days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Me and Bendigo.</v>

1343
01:00:29.070 --> 01:00:32.320
<v Speaker 1>Brian went down to west Texas hundred </v>
<v Speaker 1>some axis D,</v>

1344
01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:34.340
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went bass fishing.</v>

1345
01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:38.060
<v Speaker 1>So there was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was like a week and a half on that</v>

1346
01:00:38.061 --> 01:00:43.061
<v Speaker 1>trip that probably a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't realize that I'm without my kids </v>

1347
01:00:43.061 --> 01:00:43.061
<v Speaker 1>and family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1348
01:00:43.061 --> 01:00:47.380
<v Speaker 1>that's the hard bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could go and live out there like a </v>

1349
01:00:47.380 --> 01:00:49.660
<v Speaker 1>frigging hermit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I've got family and I freaking love </v>

1350
01:00:49.660 --> 01:00:49.660
<v Speaker 1>them and miss him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

1351
01:00:49.660 --> 01:00:50.890
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying the and like,</v>

1352
01:00:50.900 --> 01:00:54.590
<v Speaker 1>you fuck this for me because I'm sitting</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the mountain like,</v>

1353
01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:56.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is all me,</v>

1354
01:00:56.211 --> 01:00:58.820
<v Speaker 1>my element up there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's out in the middle of nowhere.</v>

1355
01:00:58.820 --> 01:01:00.980
<v Speaker 1>There's no people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no lights,</v>

1356
01:01:00.981 --> 01:01:02.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just wild animals running around</v>

1357
01:01:02.990 --> 01:01:04.700
<v Speaker 1>and I'm sitting on the mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1358
01:01:04.701 --> 01:01:05.810
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Ms Dot Kim.</v>

1359
01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:10.100
<v Speaker 1>But don't you think that that's one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the reasons why you appreciate them even</v>

1360
01:01:10.101 --> 01:01:12.950
<v Speaker 1>more than your family?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So much as it is.</v>

1361
01:01:12.951 --> 01:01:13.880
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1362
01:01:13.881 --> 01:01:15.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said once to Steve Rinella.</v>

1363
01:01:15.861 --> 01:01:19.420
<v Speaker 1>We did this crazy hunt and Prince of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Wales and it rained every day and it was</v>

1364
01:01:19.421 --> 01:01:24.421
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were just drenched where you're </v>

1365
01:01:24.421 --> 01:01:26.261
<v Speaker 1>inside your tent and the tent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I turned on my headlamp and there </v>

1366
01:01:26.261 --> 01:01:26.930
<v Speaker 1>was just water vapor everywhere in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tent,</v>

1367
01:01:26.931 --> 01:01:29.840
<v Speaker 1>like nothing ever dried out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sleeping bags wet,</v>

1368
01:01:29.841 --> 01:01:33.620
<v Speaker 1>you're miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when I got home,</v>

1369
01:01:33.950 --> 01:01:35.720
<v Speaker 1>I called him up and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1370

<v Speaker 1>difficulty in some hardship in order to </v>

1378
01:01:55.830 --> 01:01:56.260
<v Speaker 1>appreciate the good times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I feel like frequent with Kim.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's like we're new newlywed till the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and it's probably because I'm away </v>

1382
01:02:04.271 --> 01:02:04.460
<v Speaker 1>so much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but every time I come home,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>overcome a while.</v>

1384
01:02:05.721 --> 01:02:07.370

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1385
01:02:07.371 --> 01:02:10.280
<v Speaker 1>I actually just renewed my vows with Kim</v>
<v Speaker 1>15,</v>

1386
01:02:10.550 --> 01:02:12.650
<v Speaker 1>15 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 years,</v>

<v Speaker 1>married,</v>
<v Speaker 1>18 years together.</v>

1388
01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:19.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that there's something to that </v>

1389
01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:19.240
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1390
01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:19.240
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1391
01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:20.490
<v Speaker 1>absence makes the heart grow fonder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a common expression.</v>

1392
01:02:20.491 --> 01:02:23.450
<v Speaker 1>I think it's totally true and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I,</v>

1393
01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:25.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't think life is supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>easy.</v>

1394
01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:31.080
<v Speaker 1>I just did not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're supposed to do some </v>

1395
01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:31.080
<v Speaker 1>difficult cit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but on,</v>

1396
01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:34.880
<v Speaker 1>I think the sooner you realize that then</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does seem easy to you.</v>

1397
01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:40.280
<v Speaker 1>Does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the sooner you realize that </v>

1398
01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:40.800
<v Speaker 1>life's supposed to be fucking tough and </v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's not,</v>

1399
01:02:40.801 --> 01:02:44.880
<v Speaker 1>put yourself through some tough shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the better dude then it just,</v>

1401
01:02:50.350 --> 01:02:50.840
<v Speaker 1>recipe just to be happy as hell.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Because I feel like I've just lived </v>

<v Speaker 1>And then so I had to sleep there that </v>

1428
01:04:06.170 --> 01:04:06.170
<v Speaker 1>night because I wasn't walking out in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the dark.</v>

1429
01:04:06.170 --> 01:04:07.890
<v Speaker 1>And the worst thing is I'm sleeping on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1430
01:04:08.010 --> 01:04:10.920
<v Speaker 1>at the elevation that she's at and </v>
<v Speaker 1>cheese.</v>

1431
01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:14.100
<v Speaker 1>I only about 400 meters in a direct line</v>
<v Speaker 1>from my camp.</v>

1432
01:04:14.370 --> 01:04:16.220
<v Speaker 1>Oh Jesus Christ is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1433
01:04:16.350 --> 01:04:19.580
<v Speaker 1>Did you sleep well?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I manually put a shell in the chamber</v>

1434
01:04:19.581 --> 01:04:22.930
<v Speaker 1>side one shell and I just fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually slept really good that not,</v>

1435
01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:26.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it was adrenaline wore </v>
<v Speaker 1>were and often it wore me out more.</v>

1436
01:04:26.370 --> 01:04:31.370
<v Speaker 1>Were you convinced that it was going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fire even with that one shell in the </v>

1437
01:04:31.370 --> 01:04:32.400
<v Speaker 1>chamber?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have because I couldn't have the</v>

1438
01:04:32.401 --> 01:04:35.220
<v Speaker 1>magazine in there because it would jam </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the bullet,</v>

1439
01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:39.420
<v Speaker 1>but I could drop a shell in there </v>
<v Speaker 1>manually and that'd be good to go.</v>

1440
01:04:39.630 --> 01:04:40.840

<v Speaker 2>which is bigger even than a polar bear.</v>

1506
01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:59.010
<v Speaker 2>Kodiak bear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a picture of these guys standing</v>

<v Speaker 2>And that thing had long legs and that </v>

1510
01:08:09.021 --> 01:08:13.010
<v Speaker 2>thing apparently was so fast and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>ferocious that it kept people from </v>

1511
01:08:13.010 --> 01:08:14.800
<v Speaker 2>crossing the bering land bridge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1512
01:08:14.980 --> 01:08:18.260
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the reasons why they think</v>
<v Speaker 2>that people,</v>

1513
01:08:18.350 --> 01:08:21.200
<v Speaker 2>it took so long for human beings to make</v>
<v Speaker 2>it to North America.</v>

<v Speaker 2>else.</v>

1516
01:08:28.310 --> 01:08:33.310

<v Speaker 2>and then the powers of big data </v>

1517
01:08:33.310 --> 01:08:34.760
<v Speaker 2>analytics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinkful I think 10,000</v>

1518
01:08:34.930 --> 01:08:35.190
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

1519
01:08:35.980 --> 01:08:37.940
<v Speaker 2>I think that was the final.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that's the case,</v>

1520
01:08:37.941 --> 01:08:39.460

<v Speaker 2>corner.</v>

1528
01:09:09.341 --> 01:09:13.091
<v Speaker 2>star wars and that's a real animal that </v>
<v Speaker 2>lived alongside people for a long ass </v>

1529
01:09:13.491 --> 01:09:14.720
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but see what I mean.</v>

1530
01:09:14.730 --> 01:09:16.760
<v Speaker 2>If they would just run her in the wallet</v>
<v Speaker 2>still,</v>

1531
01:09:17.150 --> 01:09:22.150
<v Speaker 2>we just have a normal name for them and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't be any different cause </v>

1540
01:09:35.770 --> 01:09:35.770

<v Speaker 2>like if there was a roof over the world,</v>

1541
01:09:35.770 --> 01:09:36.620
<v Speaker 2>but there was one place where you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

1542
01:09:36.621 --> 01:09:41.621
<v Speaker 2>you could see space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody would want to take a trip to </v>

01:09:41.621 --> 01:09:41.621
<v Speaker 2>that by a 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>For all of us to look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just got to get away from some of </v>

<v Speaker 2>Is it first image on instagram?</v>

1548
01:09:52.310 --> 01:09:57.310
<v Speaker 2>Adam is not just an amazing bowhunter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but an amazing photographer just added </v>

1549
01:09:57.621 --> 01:10:02.621
<v Speaker 2>one that I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>because when you're out there and </v>

1550
01:10:02.621 --> 01:10:04.640
<v Speaker 2>honestly and like there's no artificial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no light pollution for a long,</v>

1551
01:10:04.641 --> 01:10:09.290
<v Speaker 2>long way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you look closely at that Phsi,</v>

1552
01:10:09.291 --> 01:10:10.730
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the orange lights,</v>

1553
01:10:10.731 --> 01:10:13.240
<v Speaker 2>the fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But see the clouds in the background,</v>

1554
01:10:13.250 --> 01:10:15.560
<v Speaker 2>there's a fun just a campfire that week.</v>

1555
01:10:16.310 --> 01:10:19.660
<v Speaker 2>But if you look behind that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's lightning in clouds.</v>

1556
01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:25.550
<v Speaker 2>So I ended up getting the far the </v>
<v Speaker 2>lightning and in the milky way blazing </v>

<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

1559
01:10:28.581 --> 01:10:31.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm just a dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't like I'm there and I don't go to</v>

1560
01:10:31.581 --> 01:10:36.581

<v Speaker 2>in the morning cause I'm just lying </v>

<v Speaker 2>That's beautiful.</v>

1564
01:10:44.061 --> 01:10:49.061
<v Speaker 2>So that's over our heads every night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's another thing that you just sort </v>

1565
01:10:49.061 --> 01:10:49.061
<v Speaker 2>of take for granted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1566
01:10:49.190 --> 01:10:50.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like you said,</v>

1567
01:10:50.181 --> 01:10:52.010
<v Speaker 2>the light pollution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we just,</v>

1568
01:10:52.011 --> 01:10:53.300
<v Speaker 2>we love cities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're nice,</v>

1569
01:10:53.301 --> 01:10:54.320
<v Speaker 2>they give you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1570
01:10:54.380 --> 01:10:59.380
<v Speaker 2>supermarkets and restaurants and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they also ruin your view of the </v>

1571
01:10:59.380 --> 01:10:59.380
<v Speaker 2>universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>

1572
01:10:59.380 --> 01:11:04.180
<v Speaker 2>It's not worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Worth the trade off is almost not </v>

1573
01:11:04.180 --> 01:11:08.450
<v Speaker 2>worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just don't fucking pigs now because with</v>

1574

<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so many options out there and </v>

1575
01:11:13.451 --> 01:11:13.650
<v Speaker 2>food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I reckon our taste buds have changed and</v>

1576
01:11:13.651 --> 01:11:14.100
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

1577

<v Speaker 1>Gold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no doubt.</v>

1578
01:11:14.791 --> 01:11:19.260
<v Speaker 1>Our taste buds have changed for sure </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's stuffed back then.</v>

1579
01:11:19.261 --> 01:11:24.261
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't be bland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what if you just ate those real </v>

1580
01:11:24.261 --> 01:11:24.510
<v Speaker 1>simple items now it'd be blamed as hell,</v>

<v Speaker 1>just keep shoveling and we'd just take </v>

1585
01:11:37.011 --> 01:11:37.320
<v Speaker 1>it all for granted as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent.</v>

<v Speaker 1>So like both the time spent away and the</v>

1598
01:12:20.341 --> 01:12:22.950
<v Speaker 1>time and civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing is achieving balance.</v>

1599
01:12:22.980 --> 01:12:24.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gets getting the balance.</v>

1600
01:12:24.181 --> 01:12:24.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1601
01:12:24.781 --> 01:12:26.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the civilization is awesome.</v>

1602
01:12:26.870 --> 01:12:28.950
<v Speaker 1>It's great to be able to go to a doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1603
01:12:28.951 --> 01:12:31.720
<v Speaker 1>And when you get away from all that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you are out in the walls,</v>

1604
01:12:31.790 --> 01:12:33.030
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's huge.</v>

1605
01:12:33.031 --> 01:12:36.060
<v Speaker 1>Fully realized like fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how good do we have it?</v>

1606
01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:38.640
<v Speaker 1>Like you hop in a car with air </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditioning,</v>

1607
01:12:38.641 --> 01:12:42.000
<v Speaker 1>you drive from point a to point b,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you know,</v>

1608
01:12:42.001 --> 01:12:45.330
<v Speaker 1>and I always think about how life must </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been back in the day.</v>

1609
01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:49.290
<v Speaker 1>Like it wasn't driving from point a to </v>
<v Speaker 1>point b because I had have taken fucking</v>

1610
01:12:49.291 --> 01:12:52.110
<v Speaker 1>a week dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you just jumped in the car and go.</v>

1611
01:12:52.340 --> 01:12:56.520
<v Speaker 1>It's all temperature controlled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You stop at a service station,</v>

1612
01:12:56.521 --> 01:12:58.350
<v Speaker 1>you get fuel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking I'm thirsty.</v>

1613
01:12:58.351 --> 01:12:59.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get a drink while I'm in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1614
01:13:00.230 --> 01:13:01.620
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that's just one,</v>

1615
01:13:01.950 --> 01:13:04.250
<v Speaker 1>one example of how crazy it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1616
01:13:04.260 --> 01:13:06.840
<v Speaker 1>Now when you are in the Bush,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

1617
01:13:06.841 --> 01:13:11.841
<v Speaker 1>especially when you're an art land,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you find a lot of pictographs and a lot </v>

1618
01:13:11.841 --> 01:13:12.090
<v Speaker 1>of these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1619
01:13:12.180 --> 01:13:15.210
<v Speaker 1>Because there was such a huge indigenous</v>
<v Speaker 1>population up there.</v>

1620
01:13:15.211 --> 01:13:16.470
<v Speaker 1>Well there still is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1621
01:13:16.471 --> 01:13:18.780
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put one up the other day,</v>

1622
01:13:19.290 --> 01:13:20.780
<v Speaker 1>it's a video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just Indians.</v>

1623
01:13:20.790 --> 01:13:25.790
<v Speaker 1>The stories that Jamie might find it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a main equals or looking at some </v>

1624
01:13:25.830 --> 01:13:30.830
<v Speaker 1>paintings and then I looked down and </v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's a whole human remains </v>

1625
01:13:30.830 --> 01:13:30.830
<v Speaker 1>tucked in the rocks.</v>

1626
01:13:30.830 --> 01:13:35.240
<v Speaker 1>They're ripe wrapped in pipe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A box which is a jet pilot back in </v>

1627
01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:35.650
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chocolatory I don't think so.</v>

1628
01:13:35.830 --> 01:13:37.550
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A pipe voc because it's like the,</v>

1629
01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:40.560
<v Speaker 1>the box literally rips off at like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>soft tissue paper.</v>

1630
01:13:41.190 --> 01:13:43.470
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so some mobs,</v>

1631
01:13:43.471 --> 01:13:48.471
<v Speaker 1>like indigenous people would rather do </v>
<v Speaker 1>the indigenous people call like a group </v>

1632
01:13:48.471 --> 01:13:49.800
<v Speaker 1>of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you drive here.</v>

1633
01:13:50.060 --> 01:13:53.930
<v Speaker 1>You were talking a mob of hogs earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you said that mobs,</v>

1634
01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:57.330
<v Speaker 1>a group of indigenous youth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what they call themselves,</v>

1635
01:13:57.331 --> 01:13:57.630
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1636
01:13:57.660 --> 01:13:58.380
<v Speaker 1>that's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

1637
01:13:58.410 --> 01:14:03.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't like the term like tribe or </v>

1638
01:14:03.410 --> 01:14:03.840
<v Speaker 1>anything like that because that's very </v>
<v Speaker 1>American Indians and things like that.</v>

1639
01:14:03.841 --> 01:14:08.460
<v Speaker 1>So they would say like what they hear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to really get into this because</v>

1640
01:14:08.461 --> 01:14:10.170
<v Speaker 1>this is some stuff we talked about at my</v>
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

1641
01:14:10.190 --> 01:14:13.240
<v Speaker 1>That's your podcast last time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

1642
01:14:13.241 --> 01:14:14.920
<v Speaker 1>Look at those pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>

1643
01:14:14.980 --> 01:14:19.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they real beautiful rights and now a </v>

1644
01:14:19.980 --> 01:14:22.080
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I'd call them artistic </v>

1645
01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:22.720
<v Speaker 1>because this just seemed to be what they</v>
<v Speaker 1>did,</v>

1646
01:14:22.721 --> 01:14:25.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wherever it's that dream time,</v>

1647
01:14:25.181 --> 01:14:26.470
<v Speaker 1>you would've heard about their dream </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1648
01:14:26.471 --> 01:14:28.570
<v Speaker 1>So wherever it's recording their dream </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

1649
01:14:28.930 --> 01:14:29.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1650
01:14:30.620 --> 01:14:34.330
<v Speaker 1>the indigenous would do these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these rock arts and uh,</v>

1651
01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:37.800
<v Speaker 1>sometimes I'd be carving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you go to like the Dapi damp,</v>

1652
01:14:37.950 --> 01:14:42.950
<v Speaker 1>but Lego in Western Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is in the Pilbara region that are </v>

1653
01:14:42.950 --> 01:14:46.371
<v Speaker 1>all carvings in rock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like literally scribed in the Rock and </v>

1654
01:14:46.371 --> 01:14:48.760
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the day title that you'd get,</v>

1655
01:14:48.790 --> 01:14:53.790
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so hard describing a rock that get </v>

1656
01:14:53.790 --> 01:14:53.790
<v Speaker 1>this detail in this rock that was just </v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>

1657
01:14:53.790 --> 01:14:58.670
<v Speaker 1>They use a pioneer with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd grown up different stones and get </v>

1658
01:14:58.670 --> 01:14:59.450
<v Speaker 1>different textures and colors and see </v>
<v Speaker 1>those hand prints.</v>

1659
01:14:59.470 --> 01:15:00.910
<v Speaker 1>Those hand prints have been put up.</v>

1660
01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.730
<v Speaker 1>Their hands go on the wall and then they</v>
<v Speaker 1>spray it out of their mouth.</v>

1661
01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:08.760
<v Speaker 1>So they might like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And essentially it's like a spray </v>

1662
01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:08.760
<v Speaker 1>painting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1663
01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:11.110
<v Speaker 1>but they're using their mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those other ones would be painted on and</v>

1664
01:15:11.380 --> 01:15:13.900
<v Speaker 1>you see some really crazy things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1665
01:15:13.901 --> 01:15:15.670
<v Speaker 1>I reckon that's an aim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You that white thing,</v>

1666
01:15:15.671 --> 01:15:20.671
<v Speaker 1>if you have a good look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so many paintings on there </v>

1667
01:15:20.671 --> 01:15:20.671
<v Speaker 1>that's a picture that I took a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago now.</v>

1668
01:15:20.671 --> 01:15:25.561
<v Speaker 1>But there's so many paintings on there </v>
<v Speaker 1>now that you have to stare at it for a </v>

1669
01:15:25.561 --> 01:15:25.561
<v Speaker 1>wall and then pick a different one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you know,</v>

1670
01:15:25.561 --> 01:15:28.630
<v Speaker 1>and like there's a documented so these </v>
<v Speaker 1>ones aren't,</v>

1671
01:15:28.631 --> 01:15:33.631
<v Speaker 1>so I'm one of about two white fellows </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have been to this area and a </v>

1672
01:15:34.810 --> 01:15:37.220
<v Speaker 1>traditional able to took a say like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>traditional loan.</v>

1673
01:15:37.230 --> 01:15:42.230
<v Speaker 1>I took us up there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she couldn't go up there and 90 raising </v>

1674
01:15:42.230 --> 01:15:45.760
<v Speaker 1>we were allowed in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was because this mob of people </v>

1675
01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:48.991
<v Speaker 1>that they don't exist anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last of them has passed away so it </v>

1676
01:15:48.991 --> 01:15:48.991
<v Speaker 1>was okay to go in there.</v>

1677
01:15:48.991 --> 01:15:53.760
<v Speaker 1>So I'm to take you into the full story </v>
<v Speaker 1>with like beaten down this Bush track </v>

1678
01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:58.531
<v Speaker 1>for hours and hours and we pull up at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little creek system and she just sort of</v>

1679
01:15:59.831 --> 01:16:00.820
<v Speaker 1>pointed that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>

1680
01:16:00.821 --> 01:16:01.450
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you know,</v>

1681
01:16:01.451 --> 01:16:04.270
<v Speaker 1>if you go up to the escarpment air and </v>
<v Speaker 1>into a cave or whatever,</v>

1682
01:16:04.271 --> 01:16:05.700
<v Speaker 1>you'll see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1683
01:16:05.710 --> 01:16:10.710
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the artifacts and everything that's out </v>

1684
01:16:10.710 --> 01:16:10.710
<v Speaker 1>there and this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is untouched.</v>

1685
01:16:10.710 --> 01:16:12.150
<v Speaker 1>Like crazily untouch this spot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1686
01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:14.170
<v Speaker 1>go in there and it's like a frigging </v>
<v Speaker 1>lost city,</v>

1687
01:16:14.171 --> 01:16:19.171
<v Speaker 1>but all natural,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like rocks just pushed up out of the </v>

1688
01:16:19.171 --> 01:16:22.621
<v Speaker 1>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you say the mouth of the cave </v>

1689
01:16:22.621 --> 01:16:24.541
<v Speaker 1>and a couple of paintings on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you walk into the cave and this </v>

1690
01:16:24.541 --> 01:16:24.730
<v Speaker 1>cave is 60,</v>
<v Speaker 1>70 meters long.</v>

1691
01:16:25.330 --> 01:16:28.030
<v Speaker 1>It's probably 30 percent or 30 meters </v>
<v Speaker 1>wide.</v>

1692
01:16:28.630 --> 01:16:33.630
<v Speaker 1>And the roofs probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say 10 meters tall and the hallway</v>

1693
01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:36.850
<v Speaker 1>for this cave systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those paintings,</v>

1694
01:16:36.851 --> 01:16:39.580
<v Speaker 1>like he can't ever had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they even reached the top of the cave.</v>

1695
01:16:39.610 --> 01:16:42.310
<v Speaker 1>Like there's no big rocks or anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting around anymore.</v>

1696
01:16:42.730 --> 01:16:44.830
<v Speaker 1>They still the grinding stones there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

1697
01:16:44.831 --> 01:16:47.020
<v Speaker 1>where they'll grinding up the different </v>
<v Speaker 1>paints,</v>

1698
01:16:47.050 --> 01:16:48.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's what they'd do.</v>

1699
01:16:48.041 --> 01:16:53.041
<v Speaker 1>They'd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd grind it up and work it into a </v>

1700
01:16:53.041 --> 01:16:53.041
<v Speaker 1>paste to paint with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all still sitting there.</v>

1701
01:16:53.410 --> 01:16:57.060
<v Speaker 1>And there's 30 human reminds just </v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting in the cave in a,</v>

1702
01:16:57.250 --> 01:17:00.040
<v Speaker 1>like in a pile there as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1703
01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:04.710
<v Speaker 1>so the indigenous story goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1704
01:17:04.750 --> 01:17:06.500
<v Speaker 1>and this might be a part of the dream </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

1705
01:17:06.501 --> 01:17:09.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to get this bit wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it might be a part of that,</v>

1706
01:17:09.470 --> 01:17:11.480
<v Speaker 1>like a dream time story and how it </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>

1707
01:17:11.481 --> 01:17:16.481
<v Speaker 1>But the drain time story is the kids </v>
<v Speaker 1>descended off the from the cave down </v>

1708
01:17:17.211 --> 01:17:22.211
<v Speaker 1>onto,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the escarpment down onto the flat </v>

1709
01:17:22.211 --> 01:17:22.211
<v Speaker 1>and the kids were told not to kill any </v>
<v Speaker 1>serpents,</v>

1710
01:17:22.211 --> 01:17:23.460
<v Speaker 1>like don't kill a snake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1711
01:17:23.470 --> 01:17:24.500
<v Speaker 1>they're off limits.</v>

1712
01:17:25.220 --> 01:17:30.220
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kids go down there and they can't </v>

1713
01:17:30.220 --> 01:17:31.640
<v Speaker 1>find anything to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I find a serpent,</v>

1714
01:17:31.641 --> 01:17:36.641
<v Speaker 1>like a young snake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they grabbed this knife and cut its </v>

1715
01:17:36.641 --> 01:17:37.790
<v Speaker 1>head off and it doesn't die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It keep squiggling and moving around.</v>

1716
01:17:38.330 --> 01:17:39.510
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1717
01:17:39.530 --> 01:17:44.530
<v Speaker 1>so they keep chopping or that they chop </v>
<v Speaker 1>it into little bits and it keeps </v>

1718
01:17:44.530 --> 01:17:45.090
<v Speaker 1>squiggling around and won't die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They bash it with a rock and I won't die</v>

1719
01:17:45.091 --> 01:17:50.091
<v Speaker 1>at keep squiggling around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they fry it in a fire and the fire </v>

1720
01:17:50.091 --> 01:17:53.271
<v Speaker 1>still doesn't kill it as just in pain </v>
<v Speaker 1>and squirming and squiggling around </v>

1721
01:17:53.271 --> 01:17:53.570
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the mother serpent,</v>

1722
01:17:54.270 --> 01:17:59.270
<v Speaker 1>you heard this commotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kids go back up to the escarpment </v>

1723
01:17:59.270 --> 01:18:01.490
<v Speaker 1>and into the cave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the mother serpent comes up and they</v>

1724
01:18:01.491 --> 01:18:06.491
<v Speaker 1>never used to be a creek there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she come up with such a rage that </v>

1725
01:18:06.491 --> 01:18:06.491
<v Speaker 1>she carved the creek through the land.</v>

1726
01:18:06.491 --> 01:18:08.630
<v Speaker 1>So this is how a lot of their dream time</v>
<v Speaker 1>stories go.</v>

1727
01:18:09.230 --> 01:18:14.230
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so she carved that creek in that were </v>

1728
01:18:14.230 --> 01:18:14.270
<v Speaker 1>actually camped on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She went up,</v>

1729
01:18:14.271 --> 01:18:16.080
<v Speaker 1>she found the people in the cave after </v>
<v Speaker 1>fine,</v>

1730
01:18:16.140 --> 01:18:17.480
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her young dead,</v>

1731
01:18:17.810 --> 01:18:19.850
<v Speaker 1>and she lead a fly all the way around </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1732
01:18:19.851 --> 01:18:22.880
<v Speaker 1>She raised into the cave and she burned </v>
<v Speaker 1>them out and she burned them to death.</v>

1733
01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:25.410
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1734
01:18:25.411 --> 01:18:27.680
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the indigenous story.</v>

1735
01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:32.960
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the white fellow story is the </v>

1736
01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:36.341
<v Speaker 1>indigenous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not saying one's true or one's </v>

1737
01:18:36.341 --> 01:18:37.430
<v Speaker 1>not true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll tell you how the story goes.</v>

1738
01:18:37.940 --> 01:18:42.940
<v Speaker 1>The white fellow story is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was one of the first cattle </v>

1739
01:18:42.940 --> 01:18:44.840
<v Speaker 1>stations in the northern territory of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia and the indigenous,</v>

1740
01:18:44.841 --> 01:18:48.950
<v Speaker 1>we're picking off cattle to eat and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't have known any different,</v>

1741
01:18:48.951 --> 01:18:49.820
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an animal.</v>

1742
01:18:50.210 --> 01:18:52.350
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

1743
01:18:52.490 --> 01:18:55.280
<v Speaker 1>the station owners found this out like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fan,</v>

1744
01:18:55.320 --> 01:18:58.400
<v Speaker 1>that way the indigenous will live in and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took them food as a gift,</v>

1745
01:18:58.401 --> 01:19:02.240
<v Speaker 1>but it was all laced with poison and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they end up all dine in the cave.</v>

1746
01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:03.320
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1747
01:19:03.321 --> 01:19:05.480
<v Speaker 1>there's two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two versions of the story,</v>

1748
01:19:05.500 --> 01:19:06.690
<v Speaker 1>obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1749
01:19:06.950 --> 01:19:08.840
<v Speaker 1>It's the second one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1750
01:19:08.841 --> 01:19:10.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say because who frigging</v>
<v Speaker 1>knows,</v>

1751
01:19:10.881 --> 01:19:15.050
<v Speaker 1>but I definitely know that nick isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>going around lighting fires.</v>

1752
01:19:16.070 --> 01:19:17.690
<v Speaker 1>Probably not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know what you're saying.</v>

1753
01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:23.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you listen to enough dream time </v>

1754
01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:23.880
<v Speaker 1>stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1755
01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:24.890
<v Speaker 1>and that like that will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have for a long time,</v>

1756
01:19:24.891 --> 01:19:27.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here that was so hot,</v>

1757
01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:29.670
<v Speaker 1>that was so good at hunting because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1758
01:19:29.690 --> 01:19:30.530
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1759
01:19:30.531 --> 01:19:33.380
<v Speaker 1>the indigenous didn't come up with a bow</v>
<v Speaker 1>and arrow.</v>

1760
01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:38.680
<v Speaker 1>They didn't need to like wine events </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't and you didn't need that was so </v>

1761
01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:40.060
<v Speaker 1>good with boomerangs and species and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1762
01:19:40.070 --> 01:19:43.100
<v Speaker 1>the way that they wanted that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't need a boner.</v>

1763
01:19:43.130 --> 01:19:44.150
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was insane.</v>

1764
01:19:44.151 --> 01:19:49.151
<v Speaker 1>So there are beautiful rice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're still very young to western </v>

1765
01:19:49.151 --> 01:19:49.370
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>

1766
01:19:49.370 --> 01:19:51.950
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we spoke about this last time.</v>

1767
01:19:51.951 --> 01:19:52.850
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you find it?</v>

1768
01:19:52.851 --> 01:19:57.851
<v Speaker 1>How old?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well when was like the northern </v>

1769
01:19:57.851 --> 01:20:01.511
<v Speaker 1>territory of Australia really pioneered </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's the population of </v>

1770
01:20:01.511 --> 01:20:04.781
<v Speaker 1>indigenous that we're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've been thrown into this western </v>

1771
01:20:04.781 --> 01:20:04.781
<v Speaker 1>society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1772
01:20:04.781 --> 01:20:07.290
<v Speaker 1>that we have come through slowly with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1773
01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:12.440
<v Speaker 1>That essentially that was still in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stone age because you know that that's </v>

1774
01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:14.970
<v Speaker 1>all I needed within territory in 18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>25.</v>

1775
01:20:14.971 --> 01:20:19.971
<v Speaker 1>The area occupied today in the northern </v>
<v Speaker 1>territory is part of the colony of New </v>

1776
01:20:19.971 --> 01:20:21.420
<v Speaker 1>South Wales was first settled by </v>
<v Speaker 1>Europeans in 18,</v>

1777
01:20:21.430 --> 01:20:26.430
<v Speaker 1>24 at Fort Dundas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Port Essington in 18,</v>

1778
01:20:26.761 --> 01:20:29.340
<v Speaker 1>63 control of the area was given to </v>
<v Speaker 1>South Australia.</v>

1779
01:20:29.970 --> 01:20:32.190
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not even 200 years old,</v>

1780
01:20:32.191 --> 01:20:33.330
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

1781
01:20:33.470 --> 01:20:38.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so these people have been there for </v>

1782
01:20:38.470 --> 01:20:38.470
<v Speaker 1>how many thousands of years before that </v>
<v Speaker 1>look.</v>

1783
01:20:38.470 --> 01:20:38.470
<v Speaker 1>Look that up too because I don't want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get it wrong.</v>

1784
01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:44.600
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that you were telling </v>
<v Speaker 1>me that I thought was really </v>

1785
01:20:44.600 --> 01:20:44.600
<v Speaker 1>fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were just hanging out at my house was</v>

1786
01:20:44.600 --> 01:20:46.330
<v Speaker 1>how many different languages they have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1787
01:20:46.510 --> 01:20:47.590
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like,</v>

1788
01:20:48.090 --> 01:20:53.090
<v Speaker 1>I think there's over 700 dialects and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could literally have a mob of </v>

1789
01:20:53.090 --> 01:20:57.441
<v Speaker 1>indigenous on this part of the mainland </v>
<v Speaker 1>and just a little bit further down </v>

1790
01:20:57.441 --> 01:20:59.520
<v Speaker 1>another mob of indigenous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I wouldn't speak the same language,</v>

1791
01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:05.000
<v Speaker 1>says the northern northern territory </v>
<v Speaker 1>provides evidence of settlement around </v>

1792
01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:05.310
<v Speaker 1>60,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

1793
01:21:05.311 --> 01:21:10.311
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just been blown right out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the water and it's a lot longer than </v>

1794
01:21:10.311 --> 01:21:10.311
<v Speaker 1>that now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1795
01:21:10.311 --> 01:21:11.670
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Recently?</v>

1796
01:21:11.970 --> 01:21:13.110
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just recently.</v>

1797
01:21:13.260 --> 01:21:14.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember reading something.</v>

1798
01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:19.960
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the super recently like a week </v>

1799
01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:19.960
<v Speaker 1>ago or so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1800
01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:24.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as I'm so now findings to suggest </v>

1801
01:21:24.710 --> 01:21:27.210
<v Speaker 1>that I'm Egyptian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come over at some point,</v>

1802
01:21:27.630 --> 01:21:30.750
<v Speaker 1>especially these two brothers and one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the province is a story that goes.</v>

1803
01:21:30.750 --> 01:21:32.940
<v Speaker 1>One of the brothers was really sick and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1804
01:21:32.941 --> 01:21:35.850
<v Speaker 1>he had to look after him and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1805
01:21:36.940 --> 01:21:39.030
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember how it ends,</v>

1806
01:21:39.031 --> 01:21:44.031
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Egyptians had come here just </v>

1807
01:21:44.031 --> 01:21:45.741
<v Speaker 1>because of some of the signs that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>found in those days was like a story </v>

1808
01:21:45.741 --> 01:21:46.800
<v Speaker 1>noted down on some rocks and things like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1809
01:21:46.801 --> 01:21:51.801
<v Speaker 1>So it's really crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The history behind Australia when you </v>

1810
01:21:51.801 --> 01:21:54.741
<v Speaker 1>think of it like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when you think of how young it is </v>

1811
01:21:54.741 --> 01:21:55.680
<v Speaker 1>here it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aboriginal architectural discovery in.</v>

1812
01:21:55.681 --> 01:21:57.060
<v Speaker 1>How do you say that word?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cock.</v>

1813
01:21:57.061 --> 01:21:58.570
<v Speaker 1>I do Kacadoo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

1814
01:21:58.650 --> 01:22:01.290
<v Speaker 1>Could do rewrites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The history of Australia,</v>

1815
01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:06.560
<v Speaker 1>northern territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aboriginal people have lived in </v>

1816
01:22:06.560 --> 01:22:06.560
<v Speaker 1>Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a minimum of 65,000</v>

1817
01:22:06.560 --> 01:22:08.790
<v Speaker 1>years of chemo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of archeologist has established 18,000</v>

1818
01:22:08.791 --> 01:22:13.020
<v Speaker 1>years longer than it had been proved </v>
<v Speaker 1>previously and at least 5,000</v>

1819
01:22:13.021 --> 01:22:16.830
<v Speaker 1>years long that had been speculated by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the most optimistic researchers.</v>

1820
01:22:17.730 --> 01:22:18.570
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>

1821
01:22:18.580 --> 01:22:19.330
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1822
01:22:19.410 --> 01:22:22.380
<v Speaker 1>pretty crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a long fucking time,</v>

1823
01:22:22.381 --> 01:22:25.920
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pay Five thousand years.</v>

1824
01:22:25.921 --> 01:22:30.921
<v Speaker 1>Today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The story about the damp Jacoba Lego </v>

1825
01:22:30.921 --> 01:22:30.921
<v Speaker 1>area in the Pilgra,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I mentioned earlier.</v>

1826
01:22:30.921 --> 01:22:35.190
<v Speaker 1>That's right near where I have my </v>
<v Speaker 1>business and as I have a 70,000</v>

1827
01:22:35.550 --> 01:22:40.550
<v Speaker 1>rock arts on the archipelago itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They still don't know the significance </v>

1828
01:22:40.550 --> 01:22:41.490
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>70,000,</v>

1829
01:22:42.030 --> 01:22:47.030
<v Speaker 1>but there's a story that goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The indigenous that lived on the </v>

1830
01:22:47.030 --> 01:22:50.421
<v Speaker 1>mainland with cy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much different than the people that </v>

1831
01:22:50.421 --> 01:22:54.771
<v Speaker 1>lived on the islands like cold on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>canoe people or the boat people that if </v>

1832
01:22:54.771 --> 01:22:57.780
<v Speaker 1>those canoe or boat people live or come </v>
<v Speaker 1>near the mine land,</v>

1833
01:22:58.110 --> 01:23:03.110
<v Speaker 1>the indigenous mob that lived on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mainland would clear out of there might </v>

1834
01:23:03.110 --> 01:23:04.740
<v Speaker 1>get out of it because I was so different</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the way that leave.</v>

1835
01:23:04.741 --> 01:23:09.741
<v Speaker 1>The way they spoke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way they looked was so different </v>

1836
01:23:09.741 --> 01:23:09.741
<v Speaker 1>that it was like a foreign person to.</v>

1837
01:23:09.741 --> 01:23:11.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm now scared of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

1838
01:23:12.490 --> 01:23:14.560
<v Speaker 1>It's just amazing how many different </v>
<v Speaker 1>dialects.</v>

1839
01:23:14.620 --> 01:23:16.510
<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that what you were saying,</v>

1840
01:23:16.511 --> 01:23:19.690
<v Speaker 1>that you could just go a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>kilometers away and they spoke a totally</v>

1841
01:23:19.691 --> 01:23:21.010
<v Speaker 1>different way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's correct.</v>

1842
01:23:21.011 --> 01:23:22.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't understand each other.</v>

1843
01:23:22.150 --> 01:23:23.500
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't understand each other.</v>

1844
01:23:23.501 --> 01:23:25.210
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so with my business,</v>

1845
01:23:25.240 --> 01:23:30.240
<v Speaker 1>like I've been very fortunate to work </v>
<v Speaker 1>closely with a lot of indigenous people </v>

1846
01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:31.580
<v Speaker 1>wherever it's Arnhem land,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1847
01:23:31.870 --> 01:23:36.370
<v Speaker 1>where I go hunting a lot or it's with my</v>
<v Speaker 1>business because in my business I've got</v>

1848
01:23:36.700 --> 01:23:40.030
<v Speaker 1>a joint venture with an indigenous </v>
<v Speaker 1>business owner,</v>

1849
01:23:40.810 --> 01:23:43.270
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure she's a lovely woman.</v>

1850
01:23:43.271 --> 01:23:48.271
<v Speaker 1>She's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I also have a thing where I employ </v>

1851
01:23:48.271 --> 01:23:52.831
<v Speaker 1>at least 25 percent indigenous local </v>
<v Speaker 1>indigenous people and I actually usually</v>

1852
01:23:54.041 --> 01:23:56.220
<v Speaker 1>blow them out the 50 percent at some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

1853
01:23:56.320 --> 01:23:58.360
<v Speaker 1>which is awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know the deal,</v>

1854
01:23:58.361 --> 01:24:00.550
<v Speaker 1>it's mandated by a treaty or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>

1855
01:24:00.690 --> 01:24:03.130
<v Speaker 1>Really the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mining,</v>

1856
01:24:03.460 --> 01:24:08.460
<v Speaker 1>the mining companies that I work for </v>
<v Speaker 1>would prefer an indigenous joint venture</v>

1857
01:24:09.581 --> 01:24:13.840
<v Speaker 1>owner of 25 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then what I've taken on is my,</v>

1858
01:24:13.930 --> 01:24:18.010
<v Speaker 1>for myself is just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want the 25 percent or more indigenous</v>

1859
01:24:18.011 --> 01:24:20.320
<v Speaker 1>employees as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>local indigenous people.</v>

1860
01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:23.860
<v Speaker 1>So I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been close to a lot of them and you</v>

1861
01:24:23.861 --> 01:24:27.280
<v Speaker 1>hear a lot of their different stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things is um,</v>

1862
01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:32.260
<v Speaker 1>where my business is the man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>

1863
01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:37.440
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the woman has the say in the </v>

1864
01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:37.440
<v Speaker 1>relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>

1865
01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:38.230
<v Speaker 1>financial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything like that.</v>

1866
01:24:38.470 --> 01:24:43.470
<v Speaker 1>But just two hours away the man has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the complete opposite in the main </v>

1867
01:24:43.470 --> 01:24:45.880
<v Speaker 1>has the site and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's just two hours away.</v>

1868
01:24:45.881 --> 01:24:48.730
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of these indigenous,</v>

1869
01:24:49.020 --> 01:24:51.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have married into,</v>

1870
01:24:51.490 --> 01:24:53.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone from two hours away,</v>

1871
01:24:54.070 --> 01:24:56.800
<v Speaker 1>like the Pilbara region and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>always like,</v>

1872
01:24:56.801 --> 01:24:58.660
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can we move back to onslow?</v>

1873
01:24:58.660 --> 01:25:00.640
<v Speaker 1>Whether we're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The man gets to say it's really,</v>

1874
01:25:00.970 --> 01:25:05.970
<v Speaker 1>really funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm just like that in my </v>

1875
01:25:05.970 --> 01:25:08.911
<v Speaker 1>relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's whoever's the most fucking pissed </v>

1876
01:25:08.911 --> 01:25:09.760
<v Speaker 1>off in the day gets a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>both.</v>

1877
01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:15.560
<v Speaker 1>So That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if they moved then they would switch </v>

1878
01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:15.560
<v Speaker 1>roles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>switches and that happens all the time.</v>

1879
01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:16.780
<v Speaker 1>So they just accept it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1880
01:25:16.781 --> 01:25:20.230
<v Speaker 1>They just accept it and the whole tribe </v>
<v Speaker 1>agrees.</v>

1881
01:25:20.470 --> 01:25:22.940
<v Speaker 1>That's the whole model agrees that never</v>
<v Speaker 1>exists,</v>

1882
01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:30.360
<v Speaker 1>doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it probably doesn't run so smoothly </v>

1883
01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:33.001
<v Speaker 1>there even though he knows that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other real and it's really hard for a </v>

1884
01:25:33.001 --> 01:25:34.990
<v Speaker 1>lot of westerners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't understand.</v>

1885
01:25:35.710 --> 01:25:38.230
<v Speaker 1>He's a solitary one story about uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

1886
01:25:38.390 --> 01:25:41.350
<v Speaker 1>I'll Kevin traditional liner that go </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting out on his land.</v>

1887
01:25:41.950 --> 01:25:46.950
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's been out on camp with me for a </v>

1888
01:25:46.950 --> 01:25:50.341
<v Speaker 1>couple of weeks and he hasn't had any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything about water and like a bit of </v>

1889
01:25:50.341 --> 01:25:53.050
<v Speaker 1>red meat that I've shot him and stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that and finish that.</v>

1890
01:25:53.050 --> 01:25:55.000
<v Speaker 1>He's been catching for himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>

1891
01:25:55.001 --> 01:25:58.180
<v Speaker 1>He's got family coming out and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1892
01:25:58.310 --> 01:26:03.310
<v Speaker 1>it gives them a little grocery list that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could bring from town for him </v>

1893
01:26:03.310 --> 01:26:04.540
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They bring the groceries and like,</v>

1894
01:26:04.750 --> 01:26:09.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't think in la he hasn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He hasn't had anything to really drink </v>

1895
01:26:09.750 --> 01:26:13.601
<v Speaker 1>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just had the real basic stuff for </v>

1896
01:26:13.601 --> 01:26:13.601
<v Speaker 1>fair wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get there,</v>

1897
01:26:13.601 --> 01:26:15.840
<v Speaker 1>nothing's been taken out of the bags,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but once I hand it to him,</v>

1898
01:26:15.860 --> 01:26:19.160
<v Speaker 1>I just start reaching whatever he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>grabbed out reach and like,</v>

1899
01:26:19.161 --> 01:26:24.161
<v Speaker 1>so he got a couple of bottles of coke </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all the kids and relatives of </v>

1900
01:26:24.161 --> 01:26:26.180
<v Speaker 1>drinking the coke and like they leave </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we put about this much coke.</v>

1901
01:26:26.430 --> 01:26:29.840
<v Speaker 1>He gets a pack of cigarettes or lead </v>
<v Speaker 1>hands going like grab cigarettes.</v>

1902
01:26:29.841 --> 01:26:32.650
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't look at them once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he doesn't go to say no.</v>

1903
01:26:32.680 --> 01:26:37.680
<v Speaker 1>Like I haven't had a smoke for a couple </v>
<v Speaker 1>of weeks or a drink for a couple of </v>

1904
01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:39.140
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't even blink dude or anything.</v>

1905
01:26:39.170 --> 01:26:44.170
<v Speaker 1>Just everyone takes and they just leave </v>
<v Speaker 1>him with a little bit and all this </v>

1906
01:26:44.170 --> 01:26:44.170
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>

1907
01:26:44.170 --> 01:26:44.650
<v Speaker 1>If that was me I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh boy,</v>

1908
01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:49.960
<v Speaker 1>I haven't had frequent cigarette smoke </v>
<v Speaker 1>but I haven't had a cigarette for a </v>

1909
01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:52.310
<v Speaker 1>couple of weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like ease up and it didn't bother me one</v>

1910
01:26:52.311 --> 01:26:53.240
<v Speaker 1>bit because that's how I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1911
01:26:53.250 --> 01:26:56.130
<v Speaker 1>but when one of them has something that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he doesn't have,</v>

1912
01:26:56.131 --> 01:26:58.880
<v Speaker 1>he's quite welcomed the reach in and </v>
<v Speaker 1>grab whatever he wants as well.</v>

1913
01:26:58.900 --> 01:27:02.050
<v Speaker 3>They say that was an issue with a native</v>
<v Speaker 3>Americans as well,</v>

1914
01:27:02.051 --> 01:27:03.790
<v Speaker 3>that they didn't understand property.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1915
01:27:03.850 --> 01:27:08.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't understand property and just </v>

1916
01:27:08.850 --> 01:27:08.850
<v Speaker 3>sharing what they do and it's just </v>
<v Speaker 3>normal.</v>

1917
01:27:08.850 --> 01:27:10.750
<v Speaker 3>It was this property thing came out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Europeans.</v>

1918
01:27:11.510 --> 01:27:13.750
<v Speaker 3>They didn't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they would do the same thing,</v>

1919
01:27:13.820 --> 01:27:16.000
<v Speaker 3>would take the animals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would take the food.</v>

1920
01:27:16.001 --> 01:27:18.790
<v Speaker 3>And it was normal for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if someone had left something,</v>

1921
01:27:19.060 --> 01:27:21.760
<v Speaker 3>some of the accounts of European </v>
<v Speaker 3>settlers were talking about that,</v>

1922
01:27:21.761 --> 01:27:24.350
<v Speaker 3>how native Americans seem to have no </v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding at all.</v>

1923
01:27:24.700 --> 01:27:26.350
<v Speaker 3>Why people would be upset that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>would.</v>

1924
01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:27.700
<v Speaker 3>Someone would take their problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1925
01:27:27.701 --> 01:27:29.310
<v Speaker 3>And you say that in the fuel of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>movies as</v>

1926
01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:31.830
<v Speaker 1>well that know they've kept that </v>
<v Speaker 1>dialect.</v>

1927
01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:35.400
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other thing that I was going to cite</v>

1928
01:27:35.550 --> 01:27:40.550
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's something to be like high </v>

1929
01:27:40.550 --> 01:27:40.550
<v Speaker 1>ambient,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1930
01:27:40.550 --> 01:27:43.900
<v Speaker 1>like we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we used to talk about going on </v>

1931
01:27:43.900 --> 01:27:46.660
<v Speaker 1>walkabout and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a lot of the guys that I would get </v>

1932
01:27:46.660 --> 01:27:49.891
<v Speaker 1>would get their first Pi and then not </v>
<v Speaker 1>show up to work the next morning and </v>

1933
01:27:49.980 --> 01:27:53.500
<v Speaker 1>like come back two months later and just</v>
<v Speaker 1>walk straight into the depot.</v>

1934
01:27:53.501 --> 01:27:54.880
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1935
01:27:54.881 --> 01:27:57.310
<v Speaker 1>hey boss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'd be like,</v>

1936
01:27:57.311 --> 01:28:02.311
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen you for a couple of </v>

1937
01:28:02.311 --> 01:28:02.311
<v Speaker 1>months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>might look,</v>

1938
01:28:02.311 --> 01:28:02.311
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm here for work.</v>

1939
01:28:02.311 --> 01:28:05.380
<v Speaker 1>Well not obviously because I'd get </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

1940
01:28:05.381 --> 01:28:10.381
<v Speaker 1>pay their paycheck and I'd just be happy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and go off with it for those couple of </v>

1941
01:28:10.381 --> 01:28:11.380
<v Speaker 1>months or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're not all like that.</v>

1942
01:28:11.381 --> 01:28:12.460
<v Speaker 1>But a lot of them would do that.</v>

1943
01:28:12.880 --> 01:28:15.160
<v Speaker 1>And it took me a long time to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand,</v>

1944
01:28:15.390 --> 01:28:20.390
<v Speaker 1>especially being a business owner and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just wanting everything to run nice and </v>

1945
01:28:20.390 --> 01:28:21.520
<v Speaker 1>smooth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That that's just how a lot of them are,</v>

1946
01:28:21.521 --> 01:28:26.521
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it is something to be envious about </v>

1947
01:28:26.521 --> 01:28:28.640
<v Speaker 1>because the other thing that would </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen is in the mine sites are pushing </v>

1948
01:28:28.640 --> 01:28:33.091
<v Speaker 1>for indigenous employees at this time </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'd load them up with indigenous </v>

1949
01:28:33.941 --> 01:28:35.320
<v Speaker 1>employees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there'll be a deaf,</v>

1950
01:28:35.640 --> 01:28:39.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the family and a funeral.</v>

1951
01:28:39.191 --> 01:28:43.300
<v Speaker 1>Like they won't bury their dead until </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone from the mobs there.</v>

1952
01:28:43.780 --> 01:28:46.260
<v Speaker 1>So and because some of them live so far </v>
<v Speaker 1>out and Bush,</v>

1953
01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:51.100
<v Speaker 1>it could take a week for a funeral or </v>
<v Speaker 1>some funerals go for weeks and weeks,</v>

1954
01:28:51.101 --> 01:28:53.320
<v Speaker 1>months dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these guys wouldn't show up.</v>

1955
01:28:53.321 --> 01:28:55.330
<v Speaker 1>And I'd have the client ringing me up </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

1956
01:28:55.620 --> 01:28:56.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1957
01:28:56.171 --> 01:28:57.670
<v Speaker 1>what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys aren't here today.</v>

1958
01:28:57.670 --> 01:29:02.670
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want indigenous employees and </v>

1959
01:29:02.670 --> 01:29:02.670
<v Speaker 1>indigenous business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this what happens in,</v>

1960
01:29:02.670 --> 01:29:04.350
<v Speaker 1>you need to understand their culture </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

1961
01:29:04.351 --> 01:29:07.590
<v Speaker 1>There's been a lot of um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural awareness.</v>

1962
01:29:08.060 --> 01:29:11.670
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of cultural awareness has gone out</v>

1963
01:29:11.671 --> 01:29:15.030
<v Speaker 1>there to the mine sites that now they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>all understanding that as well.</v>

1964
01:29:15.031 --> 01:29:20.031
<v Speaker 1>So they know if there's a funeral on </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're not going to have their </v>

1965
01:29:20.031 --> 01:29:22.581
<v Speaker 1>indigenous people there anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the indigenous people have an </v>

1966
01:29:22.581 --> 01:29:22.581
<v Speaker 1>adjusted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1967
01:29:22.581 --> 01:29:22.581
<v Speaker 1>they haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1968
01:29:22.581 --> 01:29:24.960
<v Speaker 1>They have to a certain degree on some </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

1969
01:29:24.961 --> 01:29:26.940
<v Speaker 1>but not a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I shouldn't have to worry about.</v>

1970
01:29:27.470 --> 01:29:27.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1971
01:29:28.950 --> 01:29:30.750
<v Speaker 2>But when they take off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't get paid.</v>

1972
01:29:32.680 --> 01:29:37.680
<v Speaker 2>You got to get work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>goes off on a walkabout and comes back </v>

1973
01:29:39.391 --> 01:29:40.950
<v Speaker 2>two months later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you just take them back in?</v>

1974
01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:42.150
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am now.</v>

1975
01:29:42.151 --> 01:29:47.151
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We usually do just because it's just </v>

1976
01:29:47.151 --> 01:29:47.970
<v Speaker 2>cultural awareness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm aware of how their culture is.</v>

1977
01:29:47.971 --> 01:29:51.240
<v Speaker 2>And that's interesting because uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

1978
01:29:51.300 --> 01:29:56.300
<v Speaker 2>whenever an invasive culture moves into </v>
<v Speaker 2>an indigenous culture because this </v>

1979
01:29:56.640 --> 01:29:57.480
<v Speaker 2>battle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1980
01:29:58.070 --> 01:30:01.150
<v Speaker 2>Try to figure out whose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whose lifestyle winds out.</v>

1981
01:30:01.151 --> 01:30:03.510
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's decimated the native American</v>

1982
01:30:03.530 --> 01:30:08.530
<v Speaker 1>and I'm thinking all of the cities and </v>
<v Speaker 1>more populated places in Australia </v>

1983
01:30:08.530 --> 01:30:10.100
<v Speaker 1>definitely has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1984
01:30:10.101 --> 01:30:15.101
<v Speaker 1>but I've just been lucky enough to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>into some of these remote areas where </v>

1985
01:30:15.101 --> 01:30:15.200
<v Speaker 1>that's not the case still.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1986
01:30:15.650 --> 01:30:20.650
<v Speaker 1>And like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look in on them and you're just </v>

1987
01:30:20.650 --> 01:30:20.650
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish I could live my life like that.</v>

1988
01:30:20.650 --> 01:30:25.150
<v Speaker 1>It's like they don't want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want some of the things that we </v>

1989
01:30:25.150 --> 01:30:25.150
<v Speaker 1>want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1990
01:30:25.380 --> 01:30:26.810
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They probably.</v>

1991
01:30:27.170 --> 01:30:27.800
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1992
01:30:27.860 --> 01:30:30.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe they envy some of the ways </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we live as well.</v>

1993
01:30:30.610 --> 01:30:34.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't fucking think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think some of them do.</v>

1994
01:30:35.340 --> 01:30:38.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I look at them out there out Bush,</v>

1995
01:30:38.001 --> 01:30:43.001
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when their ride out and it's just </v>

1996
01:30:43.001 --> 01:30:43.001
<v Speaker 1>like this is the way law should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>lived.</v>

1997
01:30:43.001 --> 01:30:44.870
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's no rush to do anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>cold,</v>

1998
01:30:44.900 --> 01:30:47.810
<v Speaker 1>get anywhere and just they just live in </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

1999
01:30:47.811 --> 01:30:48.140
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

2000

<v Speaker 2>I mean you like to like just be out like</v>

2001
01:30:52.661 --> 01:30:57.661

<v Speaker 2>spent a tremendous amount of time at </v>

2002
01:30:57.661 --> 01:31:00.720
<v Speaker 2>your cabin just out hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty chill now.</v>

2003
01:31:00.770 --> 01:31:05.770
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing about where you live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you have so many invasive </v>

2004
01:31:05.770 --> 01:31:05.770
<v Speaker 2>species,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so much,</v>

2005
01:31:05.770 --> 01:31:09.640
<v Speaker 2>so many deer and pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could just go like that.</v>

2006
01:31:09.641 --> 01:31:11.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I got bitten by a spider on the arm </v>

2028
01:32:05.881 --> 01:32:06.490
<v Speaker 1>once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's an orb spider?</v>

2029
01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:09.670
<v Speaker 1>They're not too bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like this side went numb.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2032
01:32:12.250 --> 01:32:15.320
<v Speaker 1>But it's not like bad luck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to kill you real sick.</v>

2033
01:32:17.460 --> 01:32:22.090
<v Speaker 1>So jerk off the day before the wedding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2034
01:32:22.091 --> 01:32:23.810
<v Speaker 1>That's a god.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2035
01:32:24.280 --> 01:32:27.010
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the fellow they had beat me,</v>

2036
01:32:28.690 --> 01:32:31.980
<v Speaker 1>but they're not so they're not too bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'd never looked up.</v>

2037
01:32:31.981 --> 01:32:36.981
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never looked up scorpions before </v>

2038
01:32:36.981 --> 01:32:40.171
<v Speaker 1>because I've never been bitten mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've just heard a few rumors that </v>

2039
01:32:40.171 --> 01:32:40.480
<v Speaker 1>you can get really sick from the little </v>
<v Speaker 1>ones.</v>

2040
01:32:40.780 --> 01:32:42.810
<v Speaker 1>And I picked up a bit of timber walls </v>
<v Speaker 1>building,</v>

2041
01:32:42.880 --> 01:32:47.880
<v Speaker 1>like the bond that I was doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an original photo was just a splinter </v>

2042
01:32:47.880 --> 01:32:51.421
<v Speaker 1>that cracked me and then do this hand </v>
<v Speaker 1>felt like it was about 10 times the </v>

2043
01:32:51.421 --> 01:32:52.360
<v Speaker 1>size,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in 20 seconds,</v>

2044
01:32:52.361 --> 01:32:54.640
<v Speaker 1>his hand just felt like it was just </v>
<v Speaker 1>swelling up.</v>

2045
01:32:54.700 --> 01:32:56.200
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looked fine,</v>

2046
01:32:56.201 --> 01:32:58.600
<v Speaker 1>but then you could see my veins popping </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

2047
01:32:58.601 --> 01:33:02.090
<v Speaker 1>You could feel the like the poison </v>
<v Speaker 1>running up me arm.</v>

2048
01:33:02.091 --> 01:33:03.230
<v Speaker 1>It come all about these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2049
01:33:03.350 --> 01:33:08.350
<v Speaker 1>sort of disappeared once I got into my </v>
<v Speaker 1>chest and like I ran over to the cabin </v>

2050
01:33:08.350 --> 01:33:08.560
<v Speaker 1>with me Buddy Antonio there.</v>

<v Speaker 1>excruciating.</v>

2053
01:33:15.100 --> 01:33:16.960
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he looked it up and he's like,</v>

2054
01:33:16.990 --> 01:33:19.450
<v Speaker 1>worst case scenario,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a cardiac arrest.</v>

2055
01:33:19.451 --> 01:33:21.910
<v Speaker 1>But it's in very limited cases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm like,</v>

2056
01:33:21.911 --> 01:33:23.080
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the normal case?</v>

2057

<v Speaker 1>And it's just excruciating pain for up </v>
<v Speaker 1>to two or three days,</v>

2058
01:33:26.350 --> 01:33:28.130
<v Speaker 1>two or three days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

2059
01:33:28.150 --> 01:33:30.490
<v Speaker 1>once it got into my chest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sort of disappeared.</v>

<v Speaker 1>like woke me up like it was just killing</v>

<v Speaker 1>Only this fucking big too so I can pick </v>
<v Speaker 1>a punch.</v>

2065
01:33:45.221 --> 01:33:46.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about an inch long.</v>

2066
01:33:46.630 --> 01:33:50.300
<v Speaker 1>Just a tiny little thing like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That didn't happen to me thing.</v>

2067
01:33:50.330 --> 01:33:53.280
<v Speaker 1>Christ necrosis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

2069
01:33:56.980 --> 01:33:59.380
<v Speaker 1>not freaking good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the day of the wedding,</v>

2070
01:33:59.381 --> 01:34:04.381
<v Speaker 1>while we're all getting ready to meet </v>
<v Speaker 1>good friend Ben Chambers was there all </v>

2071
01:34:04.381 --> 01:34:07.930
<v Speaker 1>have a freaking building sentence deal </v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatever I was doing and I hear a bit</v>

2072
01:34:07.931 --> 01:34:08.440
<v Speaker 1>of commotion.</v>

2073
01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:10.390
<v Speaker 1>I look over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's frigging wrestling,</v>

2074
01:34:10.410 --> 01:34:15.410
<v Speaker 1>have to spotted blue belly black snake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we've actually never had on the </v>

2075
01:34:16.031 --> 01:34:19.420
<v Speaker 1>property before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they really aggressive like,</v>

2076
01:34:20.440 --> 01:34:22.510
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorta tried to hold it out of a.</v>

2077
01:34:22.510 --> 01:34:27.510
<v Speaker 1>So I couldn't latch back and get him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I've got all these people showing </v>

2078
01:34:27.510 --> 01:34:27.700
<v Speaker 1>up for a wedding and there was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>frigging venomous snake running around.</v>

2079
01:34:27.750 --> 01:34:29.700
<v Speaker 1>Venice is a black snake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2080
01:34:29.770 --> 01:34:34.210
<v Speaker 1>I've heard that they give you a real bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>migraine but they can do the sign,</v>

2081
01:34:34.211 --> 01:34:34.900
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2082
01:34:34.930 --> 01:34:37.810
<v Speaker 1>you can have cardiac arrest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can have a bad reaction to it.</v>

2083
01:34:37.811 --> 01:34:39.670
<v Speaker 1>So there's a lot of shit that can go on </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

2084
01:34:40.150 --> 01:34:45.150
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my eight grabs this stick and a red </v>

2085
01:34:45.150 --> 01:34:45.150
<v Speaker 1>belly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>black snake,</v>

2086
01:34:45.150 --> 01:34:49.861
<v Speaker 1>wackier and then usually let go these </v>
<v Speaker 1>things in the Torres for grabbing you </v>

2087
01:34:49.861 --> 01:34:54.211
<v Speaker 1>and just pumping you with venom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what makes them the worst of the </v>

2088
01:34:54.211 --> 01:34:54.211
<v Speaker 1>black snakes.</v>

2089
01:34:54.211 --> 01:34:55.420
<v Speaker 1>Now just grab onto you and keep pumping </v>
<v Speaker 1>you with venom and they won't,</v>

2090
01:34:55.480 --> 01:34:59.240
<v Speaker 1>they won't do a drive by it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of snakes do a drive by it and uh,</v>

2091
01:34:59.270 --> 01:35:04.270
<v Speaker 1>but anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is like the friggen an hour away </v>

2092
01:35:04.270 --> 01:35:04.830
<v Speaker 1>from the wedding started dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's tangled in this snake up random</v>

2093
01:35:05.030 --> 01:35:10.030
<v Speaker 1>stick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he lets it go like further away </v>

2094
01:35:10.030 --> 01:35:12.860
<v Speaker 1>from the cabin and when he lets it go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it spews up a bloody brown snake.</v>

2095
01:35:12.861 --> 01:35:15.130
<v Speaker 1>And I sent you a video once before have </v>
<v Speaker 1>a snakes.</v>

2096
01:35:15.220 --> 01:35:17.350
<v Speaker 1>We went up another snake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing,</v>

2097
01:35:17.530 --> 01:35:22.530
<v Speaker 1>beautiful full brands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nike and then took all snakes are super </v>

2098
01:35:22.530 --> 01:35:22.530
<v Speaker 1>poisonous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2099
01:35:22.530 --> 01:35:27.161
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably should have left it alive </v>

2100
01:35:27.161 --> 01:35:27.161
<v Speaker 1>because it's taken care of the brand's </v>
<v Speaker 1>native population.</v>

2101
01:35:27.161 --> 01:35:31.280
<v Speaker 1>It has a taste for what kills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't lift the pride as a </v>

2102
01:35:31.280 --> 01:35:31.280
<v Speaker 1>cabinet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2103
01:35:31.280 --> 01:35:31.600
<v Speaker 1>if it only gives you a headache.</v>

2104
01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:33.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most of the time,</v>

2105
01:35:34.460 --> 01:35:38.510
<v Speaker 1>like in Australia and I've like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've walked thousands of miles,</v>

2106
01:35:38.511 --> 01:35:38.930
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2107
01:35:38.931 --> 01:35:40.460
<v Speaker 1>never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever had a problem.</v>

2108
01:35:41.090 --> 01:35:44.270
<v Speaker 1>That's why you need to come out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boy,</v>

2109
01:35:44.271 --> 01:35:46.260
<v Speaker 1>that's not a convincing argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Count.</v>

2110
01:35:46.310 --> 01:35:48.380
<v Speaker 1>Come visit the farm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll take you out to the cabinet.</v>

2111
01:35:48.381 --> 01:35:49.790
<v Speaker 1>Sounds good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can I get an armored suit?</v>

2112
01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:51.960

<v Speaker 1>underwear.</v>

2113
01:35:53.790 --> 01:35:58.160

<v Speaker 1>I brought you that buffalo skull because</v>

<v Speaker 1>White buffaloes.</v>

2125
01:36:23.460 --> 01:36:28.460
<v Speaker 1>So pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've actually had me head back on the </v>

2126
01:36:28.460 --> 01:36:31.811
<v Speaker 1>stick before and I had it was cold rod </v>
<v Speaker 1>up beyond me head and they'll lift up </v>

2127
01:36:31.811 --> 01:36:34.030
<v Speaker 1>and have a look in the grass and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>lifted right up beside me on my mood.</v>

2128
01:36:34.170 --> 01:36:37.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to get bit and then he just</v>
<v Speaker 1>relaxed and chilled out.</v>

2129
01:36:37.610 --> 01:36:40.640
<v Speaker 1>So you just had to just lay that second </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the left.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That is a gorgeous creature.</v>

2135
01:36:58.910 --> 01:37:01.880
<v Speaker 1>It's not uncommon to see a few of them </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the summer boy hunting,</v>

2136
01:37:01.881 --> 01:37:03.110

01:37:17.540 --> 01:37:19.730
<v Speaker 1>Then he's got these video where he </v>
<v Speaker 1>catches,</v>

2142
01:37:19.790 --> 01:37:24.790

<v Speaker 1>belly black snake and he puts them down </v>

2143
01:37:24.921 --> 01:37:28.700
<v Speaker 1>rabbit holes and then they chased the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rabbits out electronic.</v>

2144
01:37:28.701 --> 01:37:33.701
<v Speaker 1>They trying to get shelter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They chased these rabbits out and he </v>

<v Speaker 1>He knows all the wildlife stuff that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>can eat,</v>

2277
01:44:26.110 --> 01:44:28.780
<v Speaker 1>but the indigenous has spent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2278
01:44:29.410 --> 01:44:34.410
<v Speaker 1>a long time trying to work out what they</v>
<v Speaker 1>can incarnate and there's heaps of </v>

2279
01:44:34.410 --> 01:44:38.611
<v Speaker 1>things that you can eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they've got to be boiled for a </v>

2280
01:44:38.611 --> 01:44:40.561
<v Speaker 1>certain amount of period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can only eight to this far into it </v>

2281
01:44:40.561 --> 01:44:41.740
<v Speaker 1>and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've watched you fucking cock at dude.</v>

2282
01:44:42.130 --> 01:44:43.360
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

2283
01:44:43.770 --> 01:44:47.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's a route or type of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fruit and you definitely can't eat it,</v>

2284
01:44:47.590 --> 01:44:52.590
<v Speaker 1>like crush it up and they put it in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>water and it takes a lot of the water </v>

2285
01:44:52.590 --> 01:44:52.590
<v Speaker 1>and all the fish float.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2286
01:44:52.590 --> 01:44:53.830
<v Speaker 1>I've seen that in South American.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2287
01:44:53.831 --> 01:44:56.440
<v Speaker 1>I got yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So imagine how long it took to work out.</v>

2288
01:44:56.441 --> 01:44:58.330
<v Speaker 1>That actually looked like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy,</v>

2289
01:44:58.331 --> 01:44:58.630
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

2290
01:44:58.800 --> 01:45:02.070
<v Speaker 2>That's another thing that they eat in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bolivia.</v>

2291
01:45:02.860 --> 01:45:04.220
<v Speaker 2>Casaba.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2292
01:45:04.221 --> 01:45:05.220
<v Speaker 2>I've never heard of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't.</v>

2293
01:45:05.230 --> 01:45:08.700
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a route that if you eat it raw,</v>

2294
01:45:09.090 --> 01:45:14.090
<v Speaker 2>it's super toxic as a whole really </v>
<v Speaker 2>involved process where you have to.</v>

2295
01:45:15.330 --> 01:45:20.330
<v Speaker 2>You have to soak it and then you have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>drain it very similar and then it turns </v>

2296
01:45:22.720 --> 01:45:26.070
<v Speaker 2>into A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's actually Sinai that comes out of</v>

2297
01:45:26.071 --> 01:45:26.220
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2298
01:45:27.730 --> 01:45:30.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See if you can find a video,</v>

2299
01:45:30.640 --> 01:45:35.640
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on preparation of Casaba and this </v>

2300
01:45:35.640 --> 01:45:38.470
<v Speaker 2>cassava is apparently Rinella was </v>
<v Speaker 2>telling me about it.</v>

2301
01:45:38.471 --> 01:45:42.580
<v Speaker 2>That's what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had read about it before,</v>

2302
01:45:42.581 --> 01:45:47.581
<v Speaker 2>but Rinella was telling me how poisonous</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is that the stuff that they like,</v>

2303
01:45:48.910 --> 01:45:53.910
<v Speaker 2>but that good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like birth gay lover.</v>

2304
01:45:54.400 --> 01:45:56.410
<v Speaker 2>That's what it looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2305
01:45:56.411 --> 01:45:57.770
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2306
01:45:57.870 --> 01:46:00.170
<v Speaker 2>they have these buckets around the camp </v>
<v Speaker 2>fire.</v>

2307
01:46:00.280 --> 01:46:02.500
<v Speaker 2>You've got to find a better video than </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

2308
01:46:02.501 --> 01:46:03.320
<v Speaker 2>This cat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So good.</v>

2309
01:46:03.370 --> 01:46:05.070
<v Speaker 2>All the rest of her recipes that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2310
01:46:05.080 --> 01:46:07.490
<v Speaker 2>some of those preparing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2311
01:46:08.200 --> 01:46:11.980
<v Speaker 2>Well there's a really involved process </v>
<v Speaker 2>in order to cook it.</v>

2312
01:46:12.870 --> 01:46:13.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

2313
01:46:13.710 --> 01:46:16.080
<v Speaker 1>you get it right or you're dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're dead,</v>

2314
01:46:16.120 --> 01:46:16.480
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2315
01:46:17.370 --> 01:46:22.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just amazing that they figured this out </v>

2316
01:46:22.370 --> 01:46:23.550
<v Speaker 2>so you have to do all this stuff to it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and prepare it.</v>

2317
01:46:23.551 --> 01:46:28.551
<v Speaker 2>And the actual buckets of liquid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were saying Rinella was talking </v>

2318
01:46:28.551 --> 01:46:30.240
<v Speaker 2>about how they just leave them around </v>
<v Speaker 2>the camp and he was like,</v>

2319
01:46:30.300 --> 01:46:31.930
<v Speaker 2>what if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if a kid drinks that?</v>

2320
01:46:32.330 --> 01:46:36.140
<v Speaker 2>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she's cooking it up.</v>

2321
01:46:36.230 --> 01:46:39.560
<v Speaker 2>Just got some way to special anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

2322
01:46:40.580 --> 01:46:45.580
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean how long did it take them to </v>

2323
01:46:45.580 --> 01:46:45.580
<v Speaker 2>figure out that if they can grind that </v>
<v Speaker 2>plan up,</v>

2324
01:46:45.580 --> 01:46:45.660
<v Speaker 2>throw it in the water official Pamela</v>

2325
01:46:46.050 --> 01:46:48.510
<v Speaker 1>died eating their cells because it looks</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a fruit.</v>

2326
01:46:48.620 --> 01:46:53.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's so many in the Australian </v>

2327
01:46:53.620 --> 01:46:55.200
<v Speaker 1>outback that look and smell and even </v>
<v Speaker 1>taste good.</v>

2328
01:46:55.380 --> 01:46:56.550
<v Speaker 1>But man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll kill you.</v>

2329
01:46:56.650 --> 01:47:00.150
<v Speaker 1>Baseball crazy when you think about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>trial and error involved in figuring out</v>

2330
01:47:00.151 --> 01:47:02.030
<v Speaker 1>what you can and can't eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mother,</v>

2331
01:47:02.140 --> 01:47:04.260
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we've got all these books.</v>

2332
01:47:04.280 --> 01:47:09.280
<v Speaker 1>Least that takes the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>takes the mystery out of stuff like </v>

2333
01:47:09.280 --> 01:47:09.280
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But even then people screw it up.</v>

2334
01:47:09.280 --> 01:47:10.740
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>official time with mushrooms.</v>

2335
01:47:10.920 --> 01:47:14.220
<v Speaker 1>I nearly did it the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's one that it's um,</v>

2336
01:47:14.610 --> 01:47:19.530
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of tastes similar to an apple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a little bit like on the sour side,</v>

2337
01:47:19.531 --> 01:47:22.590
<v Speaker 1>if it was an unripe apple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's completely edible.</v>

2338
01:47:23.310 --> 01:47:25.260
<v Speaker 1>There's another one that looks nearly </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly the same,</v>

2339
01:47:25.261 --> 01:47:27.780
<v Speaker 1>but it drops the same pink flare at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom of it.</v>

2340
01:47:27.781 --> 01:47:32.781
<v Speaker 1>It's got this little spike that comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>off it and so I'd been walking around </v>

2341
01:47:32.781 --> 01:47:35.310
<v Speaker 1>eating these other ones because I didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have hardly any food and then I'm like,</v>

2342
01:47:35.311 --> 01:47:40.311
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a freaking whole heap of me and </v>

2343
01:47:40.311 --> 01:47:41.991
<v Speaker 1>I grabbed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grabbed them and just put them in the </v>

2344
01:47:41.991 --> 01:47:41.991
<v Speaker 1>backpack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got to this waterhole,</v>

2345
01:47:41.991 --> 01:47:46.040
<v Speaker 1>crack that open and just force shit is </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the same time and then I smelled it </v>

2346
01:47:46.040 --> 01:47:46.040
<v Speaker 1>and straight away.</v>

2347
01:47:46.040 --> 01:47:50.570
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't have the same seeds or </v>

2348
01:47:50.570 --> 01:47:52.791
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how quick of a mistake to make and </v>

2349
01:47:52.791 --> 01:47:55.491
<v Speaker 1>that one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that second one that I grabbed his </v>

2350
01:47:55.491 --> 01:47:55.491
<v Speaker 1>really frigging poisonous too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>

2351
01:47:55.530 --> 01:48:00.530
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to carry a Bush Tucker book with </v>

2352
01:48:00.530 --> 01:48:02.841
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at least those books out there now </v>

2353
01:48:02.841 --> 01:48:02.841
<v Speaker 1>food things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2354
01:48:02.841 --> 01:48:05.240
<v Speaker 1>I've seen those ads around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2355
01:48:05.250 --> 01:48:10.250
<v Speaker 1>they use them for Sushi apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the really a skillful Sushi chefs.</v>

2356
01:48:10.770 --> 01:48:15.090
<v Speaker 1>They slice through this thing and filet </v>
<v Speaker 1>it put what the fuck.</v>

2357
01:48:15.450 --> 01:48:18.090
<v Speaker 1>The smallest mistake in preparation </v>
<v Speaker 1>could be fatal,</v>

2358
01:48:18.091 --> 01:48:23.091
<v Speaker 1>but Tokyo city's government is planning </v>
<v Speaker 1>to ease restrictions that allow only </v>

2359
01:48:23.091 --> 01:48:25.050
<v Speaker 1>highly trained and licensed chef to </v>
<v Speaker 1>serve the dish.</v>

2360
01:48:25.680 --> 01:48:30.680
<v Speaker 1>Fuck all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll just have a fucking eighth and </v>

2361
01:48:30.680 --> 01:48:30.930
<v Speaker 1>normal fish cross too many crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>assholes.</v>

2362
01:48:31.290 --> 01:48:36.290
<v Speaker 1>But I think it's for people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they like the thrill of knowing that </v>

2363
01:48:36.290 --> 01:48:36.290
<v Speaker 1>they're reading something that could </v>
<v Speaker 1>kill,</v>

2364
01:48:36.290 --> 01:48:38.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if prepared incorrectly.</v>

2365
01:48:38.550 --> 01:48:40.460
<v Speaker 1>He sounds like a fucking nail company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Montana.</v>

2366
01:48:43.800 --> 01:48:47.100
<v Speaker 1>So how good that elk taste though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Knowing what all the way through it.</v>

2367
01:48:47.190 --> 01:48:52.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because all the stuff and by the end </v>

2368
01:48:52.190 --> 01:48:52.190
<v Speaker 1>like you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can only have limited food with you.</v>

2369
01:48:52.190 --> 01:48:54.990
<v Speaker 1>And then even though I come out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wall,</v>

2370
01:48:55.080 --> 01:48:57.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for like I come into town and bought the</v>

2371

<v Speaker 1>food and shit.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I just go into town,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2378
01:49:11.810 --> 01:49:11.820
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to live off the land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I must have brought some food with you,</v>

2379

<v Speaker 1>Your meals?</v>

2383
01:49:20.430 --> 01:49:22.170
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little energy bars,</v>

2384
01:49:22.171 --> 01:49:24.360
<v Speaker 1>just because everything's got to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>light,</v>

2385
01:49:24.450 --> 01:49:29.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so most everything was dehydrated or </v>

2386
01:49:29.450 --> 01:49:30.450
<v Speaker 1>just like a light type of food is </v>
<v Speaker 1>simple.</v>

2387
01:49:30.860 --> 01:49:34.770
<v Speaker 1>Simple as it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then heaps of chocolate bars.</v>

2389
01:49:35.881 --> 01:49:38.220
<v Speaker 1>but fuck,</v>

<v Speaker 1>but we do have sneakers,</v>

2401
01:50:05.170 --> 01:50:06.670
<v Speaker 1>but like we've got a Mars bar.</v>

2402
01:50:06.700 --> 01:50:09.100
<v Speaker 1>You don't have a Mars bar here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called a Milky Way.</v>

2403
01:50:09.130 --> 01:50:10.210

<v Speaker 1>be favorite it.</v>

2405
01:50:12.670 --> 01:50:13.760
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>different back in Australia as well.</v>

2408
01:50:20.261 --> 01:50:22.060
<v Speaker 1>And they are more similar to a Mars bar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

2409
01:50:22.540 --> 01:50:24.550
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the first 11 days I pretty well,</v>

2410
01:50:24.551 --> 01:50:26.320
<v Speaker 1>but I'd still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I could spare food,</v>

2411
01:50:26.321 --> 01:50:28.280
<v Speaker 1>like if I could shoot a grouse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh elite,</v>

2412
01:50:28.300 --> 01:50:31.090
<v Speaker 1>that if I come across barriers I'd eat </v>
<v Speaker 1>those.</v>

2413
01:50:31.460 --> 01:50:36.460
<v Speaker 1>M and I sort of had contact with um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>April Voki who's like really into the </v>

2414
01:50:37.481 --> 01:50:40.920
<v Speaker 1>outdoors and fly fishing and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She knows a lot of Australia.</v>

2415
01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:42.740
<v Speaker 1>I did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2416
01:50:42.741 --> 01:50:43.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she's,</v>

2417
01:50:43.750 --> 01:50:48.130
<v Speaker 1>she's hunted with us a few times and her</v>
<v Speaker 1>get along like a house on fire.</v>

2418
01:50:48.131 --> 01:50:51.000
<v Speaker 1>So it works out good so far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good House.</v>

2419
01:50:51.040 --> 01:50:54.550
<v Speaker 1>You don't have that same eva get along </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a house on fire.</v>

2420
01:50:54.551 --> 01:50:59.320
<v Speaker 1>That seems like a terrible way to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>along with your fucking furious.</v>

2421
01:51:02.050 --> 01:51:05.950
<v Speaker 1>That's a few of those weird ones and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2422
01:51:05.951 --> 01:51:08.470
<v Speaker 1>how'd they even come up with that one </v>
<v Speaker 1>right there?</v>

2423
01:51:09.440 --> 01:51:10.600
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like jump the gun.</v>

2424

<v Speaker 1>jumped the gun.</v>

2428
01:51:18.581 --> 01:51:23.581
<v Speaker 1>Makes Sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes more sense to get along like a </v>

2429
01:51:23.581 --> 01:51:26.191
<v Speaker 1>house on fire unless you have the fire </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're fucking burning up your </v>

2430
01:51:26.191 --> 01:51:28.440
<v Speaker 1>gun blazing so you could look at it like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that as well.</v>

01:51:28.460 --> 01:51:29.700
<v Speaker 1>See where you're going with that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>can I make this?</v>

2435
01:51:40.110 --> 01:51:42.400
<v Speaker 1>The worst thing is because she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes she be busy.</v>

2436
01:51:42.401 --> 01:51:44.980
<v Speaker 1>I'd be collecting heaps of them.</v>

<v Speaker 1>pretty hard,</v>

2448
01:52:15.191 --> 01:52:17.090
<v Speaker 1>but they're really good for you,</v>

2520
01:55:18.560 --> 01:55:23.560
<v Speaker 2>GRUBS went up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They building the cabinet and I'm </v>

2521
01:55:23.560 --> 01:55:25.691
<v Speaker 2>stripping the bark off it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You will see all those grubs and I get </v>

2522
01:55:25.691 --> 01:55:25.691
<v Speaker 2>them and cook them up and eat and eat </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

2523
01:55:27.020 --> 01:55:28.660
<v Speaker 2>Just like paint up out at night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but better.</v>

2524
01:55:28.910 --> 01:55:30.180
<v Speaker 2>They taste like peanut butter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2525
01:55:30.200 --> 01:55:30.740
<v Speaker 2>they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2526
01:55:30.830 --> 01:55:31.470
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2527
01:55:31.490 --> 01:55:36.490
<v Speaker 2>Probably even better than peanut butter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What kind of peanut butter do you guys </v>

2528
01:55:36.490 --> 01:55:36.490
<v Speaker 2>have in Australia?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They pretty good.</v>

2529
01:55:36.490 --> 01:55:36.770
<v Speaker 2>What does that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2530
01:55:36.771 --> 01:55:39.800
<v Speaker 2>honey and honey and sugar ants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are good.</v>

2531
01:55:39.810 --> 01:55:41.000
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

2532
01:55:41.200 --> 01:55:46.200
<v Speaker 2>And if you run out of like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're running out of tea or you </v>

2533
01:55:46.200 --> 01:55:50.391
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want a hot drink and you're out </v>

2534
01:55:50.391 --> 01:55:52.131
<v Speaker 2>in the bush,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you'd boil your water and then </v>

2535
01:55:52.131 --> 01:55:54.801
<v Speaker 2>you'd get a heap of those in a leaf or </v>
<v Speaker 2>on a leaf and you dip them in hot water </v>

2536
01:55:54.801 --> 01:55:56.670
<v Speaker 2>and it makes like a nice tea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's like sweetened already from the</v>

2537
01:55:56.671 --> 01:55:59.010
<v Speaker 2>ant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I carry like a sugary taste on them.</v>

2538
01:55:59.320 --> 01:56:04.320
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that little thing on there but is </v>

2539
01:56:04.320 --> 01:56:04.320
<v Speaker 2>actually honey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

2540
01:56:04.320 --> 01:56:06.990
<v Speaker 2>They have a little bubble pack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it's not really honey,</v>

2541
01:56:06.991 --> 01:56:08.550
<v Speaker 2>but it tastes like honey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

2542
01:56:08.551 --> 01:56:09.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks like honey though.</v>

2543
01:56:10.090 --> 01:56:15.090
<v Speaker 2>Well what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure that anything that can </v>

2544
01:56:15.090 --> 01:56:15.090
<v Speaker 2>produce honey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy though.</v>

2545
01:56:15.090 --> 01:56:16.500
<v Speaker 2>The Bar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's their abdomen essentially,</v>

2546
01:56:16.501 --> 01:56:16.980
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

2547
01:56:17.040 --> 01:56:21.750
<v Speaker 2>So it looks like those black things </v>
<v Speaker 2>settled as a separated.</v>

2548
01:56:21.751 --> 01:56:22.180
<v Speaker 2>Rather.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2549
01:56:22.240 --> 01:56:25.920
<v Speaker 2>we'd look fucking some in photoshop.</v>

2550
01:56:29.850 --> 01:56:31.830
<v Speaker 2>So strange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're tiny.</v>

2551
01:56:31.831 --> 01:56:36.831
<v Speaker 2>Strange because we don't eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But imagine those things were grown on a</v>

2552
01:56:36.931 --> 01:56:40.350
<v Speaker 2>farm or and harvested for mass </v>
<v Speaker 2>production.</v>

2553
01:56:40.351 --> 01:56:43.770
<v Speaker 2>No different than lame or I know what </v>
<v Speaker 2>insects do.</v>

2554
01:56:43.771 --> 01:56:45.570
<v Speaker 2>We ate none,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is frigging weird.</v>

2555
01:56:45.571 --> 01:56:47.250
<v Speaker 2>Why wouldn't we ate insects?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They food.</v>

2556
01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:52.530
<v Speaker 2>People are starting to eat crickets and </v>
<v Speaker 2>frogs and crickets being bugs.</v>

2557
01:56:52.580 --> 01:56:54.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people eat crickets these days.</v>

2558
01:56:55.110 --> 01:56:56.610
<v Speaker 2>Cricket,</v>
<v Speaker 2>protein powder.</v>

2559
01:56:56.611 --> 01:56:59.610
<v Speaker 2>It's very popular in America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it will become,</v>

2560
01:56:59.640 --> 01:57:02.680
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't say very like there's two </v>
<v Speaker 2>people in all of America.</v>

2561
01:57:02.710 --> 01:57:04.170
<v Speaker 2>We'd becoming more properly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have,</v>

2562
01:57:04.510 --> 01:57:07.200
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they have a nice cricket protein</v>

2563
01:57:07.201 --> 01:57:12.201
<v Speaker 2>bar that you can buy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't tried them but I send a </v>

2564
01:57:12.201 --> 01:57:13.160
<v Speaker 2>Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've heard good things about them.</v>

2565
01:57:13.530 --> 01:57:17.040
<v Speaker 2>But I've been in Mexico and we went to </v>
<v Speaker 2>this resort and when you check into your</v>

2566
01:57:17.041 --> 01:57:22.041
<v Speaker 2>hotel room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have like a little bowl of fried </v>

2567
01:57:22.041 --> 01:57:22.500
<v Speaker 2>crickets really with chili powder and </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

2568
01:57:22.620 --> 01:57:25.260
<v Speaker 2>Proudly strange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is that?</v>

2569
01:57:25.440 --> 01:57:29.130
<v Speaker 2>That the company and they sell crooked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2570
01:57:29.131 --> 01:57:32.250
<v Speaker 2>xl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's his Goddamn pop up ads?</v>

2571
01:57:32.580 --> 01:57:37.580
<v Speaker 2>So Ekso Exoskeleton is curriculum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can understand why we wouldn't eat,</v>

2572
01:57:38.850 --> 01:57:39.920
<v Speaker 2>but we should have six.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2573
01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:45.000
<v Speaker 2>not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but vegans should shitty them because </v>

2574
01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:46.080
<v Speaker 2>it's a great way to get be 12 and most </v>
<v Speaker 2>people don't really care that much about</v>

2575
01:57:46.081 --> 01:57:47.250
<v Speaker 2>bugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the,</v>

2576
01:57:47.260 --> 01:57:47.650
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2577
01:57:47.700 --> 01:57:52.700
<v Speaker 2>the thing about Vegan seems to be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sentient animals and worrying about </v>

2578
01:57:52.891 --> 01:57:57.120
<v Speaker 2>killing these.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm feeling life for them and if they,</v>

2579
01:57:57.121 --> 01:57:59.880
<v Speaker 2>if that's the way they feel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they could be far healthier.</v>

2580
01:58:00.120 --> 01:58:04.320
<v Speaker 2>Eating mollusks mollusks are a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't feel shit and they're fucking</v>

2581
01:58:04.321 --> 01:58:09.321
<v Speaker 2>stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like marks they say are dumber than </v>

2582
01:58:09.321 --> 01:58:12.081
<v Speaker 2>plants are more primitive than plants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that they move is what freaks </v>

2583
01:58:12.081 --> 01:58:13.570
<v Speaker 2>people out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what does a Vegan eat?</v>

2584
01:58:13.571 --> 01:58:18.571
<v Speaker 2>A Venus fly trap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would they eat that fucking moves to </v>

2585
01:58:18.571 --> 01:58:22.410
<v Speaker 2>plant on the move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just take a left on the move and </v>

2586
01:58:22.410 --> 01:58:22.410
<v Speaker 2>grow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2587
01:58:22.410 --> 01:58:23.370
<v Speaker 2>But crickets are really good source of </v>
<v Speaker 2>protein,</v>

2588
01:58:23.371 --> 01:58:27.540
<v Speaker 2>so if someone wants to get animal or </v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of living proteins,</v>

2589
01:58:27.760 --> 01:58:32.760
<v Speaker 2>particularly like the nutrients and </v>
<v Speaker 2>amino acids that you can get from that </v>

2590
01:58:32.760 --> 01:58:33.810
<v Speaker 2>kind of protein,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just look into insects don't die.</v>

2591
01:58:33.811 --> 01:58:38.811
<v Speaker 2>You fuckers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to stop my insect farming to </v>

2651
02:01:11.261 --> 02:01:14.530
<v Speaker 1>I developed an amazing ability to not </v>
<v Speaker 1>listen when someone's talking.</v>

2652
02:01:15.910 --> 02:01:17.680
<v Speaker 1>That's what I've been doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This whole show.</v>

2653
02:01:17.710 --> 02:01:22.710
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean I could hear they talk </v>

2654
02:01:25.091 --> 02:01:30.091
<v Speaker 1>about stuff that I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially with my wife gets together </v>

2655
02:01:30.091 --> 02:01:32.551
<v Speaker 1>with her friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can have a conversation that could </v>

2656
02:01:32.551 --> 02:01:34.741
<v Speaker 1>be right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't hear a fucking thing came lobby </v>

2657
02:01:34.741 --> 02:01:34.910
<v Speaker 1>in a field.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just hearing truth.</v>

2658
02:01:37.200 --> 02:01:38.830
<v Speaker 1>You're antisocial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2659
02:01:38.860 --> 02:01:39.920
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not antisocial.</v>

2660
02:01:39.921 --> 02:01:41.840
<v Speaker 1>I just don't have to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

2661
02:01:41.850 --> 02:01:46.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm quite happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sitting there quietly thing think is a </v>

2662
02:01:46.850 --> 02:01:49.930
<v Speaker 1>very big biological difference between </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way women like to especially a guy </v>

2663
02:01:49.930 --> 02:01:53.870
<v Speaker 1>like you who does so much hunting where </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very valuable to be quiet.</v>

2664
02:01:53.900 --> 02:01:56.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've actually had some friends say to me</v>

2665
02:01:56.450 --> 02:02:01.450
<v Speaker 1>like that I'm very antisocial and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're not interested in hanging </v>

2666
02:02:01.761 --> 02:02:05.300
<v Speaker 1>out with first and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And friends hunt.</v>

2667
02:02:05.680 --> 02:02:06.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do.</v>

2668
02:02:06.261 --> 02:02:09.400
<v Speaker 1>But I like hunting solo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I just,</v>

2669
02:02:10.010 --> 02:02:11.450
<v Speaker 1>but it's not like a choice that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2670
02:02:11.451 --> 02:02:14.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm not fucking taken humor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not inviting him or whatever,</v>

2671
02:02:14.990 --> 02:02:18.200
<v Speaker 1>but I'm just happy to do it alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I'm planning a trip,</v>

2672
02:02:18.201 --> 02:02:23.201
<v Speaker 1>I don't necessarily plan it around </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone else's time or something like </v>

2673
02:02:23.201 --> 02:02:26.951
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they think you're antisocial because </v>

2674
02:02:26.951 --> 02:02:26.951
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't do it.</v>

2675
02:02:26.951 --> 02:02:26.951
<v Speaker 1>Well the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2676
02:02:26.951 --> 02:02:28.190
<v Speaker 1>and they and they're a little bit like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2677
02:02:28.850 --> 02:02:33.850
<v Speaker 1>they also like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can you just go out there by </v>

2678
02:02:33.850 --> 02:02:35.771
<v Speaker 1>yourself like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like don't you get bored or you don't </v>

2679
02:02:35.771 --> 02:02:35.771
<v Speaker 1>miss talking to someone or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

2680
02:02:36.040 --> 02:02:37.760
<v Speaker 1>and it's taken me years to figure it </v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

2681
02:02:37.761 --> 02:02:42.761
<v Speaker 1>like why am I so comfortable being by </v>
<v Speaker 1>myself or not saying a word in a crowd </v>

2682
02:02:42.761 --> 02:02:43.290
<v Speaker 1>of people at a talk and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

2683
02:02:43.670 --> 02:02:45.550
<v Speaker 1>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2684
02:02:45.560 --> 02:02:50.560
<v Speaker 1>my past growing up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But a lot of it's been from my past </v>

2685
02:02:50.560 --> 02:02:53.681
<v Speaker 1>growing up and like I've nailed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I grew up with people that </v>

2686
02:02:53.681 --> 02:02:56.090
<v Speaker 1>were supposed to be loved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ones that didn't show love at all.</v>

2687
02:02:56.480 --> 02:03:00.290
<v Speaker 1>In fact they taught you the complete </v>
<v Speaker 1>opposite instead of teaching trust,</v>

2688
02:03:00.291 --> 02:03:03.500
<v Speaker 1>like poor distrust because this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be a person that's close and</v>

2689
02:03:03.501 --> 02:03:06.260
<v Speaker 1>treat your world and they're fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>treating you like shit.</v>

2690
02:03:06.710 --> 02:03:11.710
<v Speaker 1>So you slowly start moving away from </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of mankind in a sense where we </v>

2691
02:03:13.450 --> 02:03:16.400
<v Speaker 1>started association associating people </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a negative feeling.</v>

2692
02:03:16.430 --> 02:03:19.610
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the way that I'd get treated,</v>

2693
02:03:19.700 --> 02:03:24.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>growing up was I'd be better off by </v>

2694
02:03:24.700 --> 02:03:24.700
<v Speaker 1>myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2695
02:03:24.700 --> 02:03:26.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm better off safer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kim sort of that now.</v>

2696
02:03:26.271 --> 02:03:28.850
<v Speaker 1>But that's what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has she directed it?</v>

2697
02:03:28.851 --> 02:03:29.780
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2698
02:03:29.820 --> 02:03:31.680
<v Speaker 1>I grew up all those years knowing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2699
02:03:31.760 --> 02:03:36.760
<v Speaker 1>not to trust people and people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking actually dangerous and stuff </v>

2700
02:03:36.760 --> 02:03:40.151
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm happy being off by myself and </v>

2701
02:03:40.151 --> 02:03:40.460
<v Speaker 1>doing my own thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then like I said,</v>

2702
02:03:40.461 --> 02:03:45.461
<v Speaker 1>now it's different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got my own family and I know the </v>

2703
02:03:45.461 --> 02:03:47.771
<v Speaker 1>complete opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I trust and love and everything like </v>

2704
02:03:47.771 --> 02:03:50.621
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's also the hunting thing for you </v>

2705
02:03:50.621 --> 02:03:52.661
<v Speaker 1>that when you're hunting you're just </v>
<v Speaker 1>locked in on the task at hand to a </v>

2706
02:03:53.181 --> 02:03:53.630
<v Speaker 1>degree.</v>

2707
02:03:53.630 --> 02:03:58.630
<v Speaker 1>Definitely don't want someone with you </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's going to mess it up or not </v>

2708
02:04:00.200 --> 02:04:05.200
<v Speaker 1>because I'm not a self that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of sounds a little bit </v>

2709
02:04:05.200 --> 02:04:05.200
<v Speaker 1>selfish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean it that way.</v>

2710
02:04:05.210 --> 02:04:10.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I mean is it like you're focused </v>

2711
02:04:10.210 --> 02:04:10.250
<v Speaker 1>now definitely focused on need anybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>else?</v>

2712
02:04:10.251 --> 02:04:13.670
<v Speaker 1>But when you're focused you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really don't need anybody else.</v>

2713
02:04:13.671 --> 02:04:14.410
<v Speaker 1>It's just the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2714
02:04:14.420 --> 02:04:17.030
<v Speaker 1>the task,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just you against the elements.</v>

2715
02:04:17.810 --> 02:04:19.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2716
02:04:19.810 --> 02:04:22.880
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's that it's pushing myself.</v>

2717
02:04:23.130 --> 02:04:25.220
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love the fucking wilderness.</v>

2718
02:04:25.310 --> 02:04:27.080
<v Speaker 1>Like it's just as simple as that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Joe,</v>

2719
02:04:27.081 --> 02:04:32.081
<v Speaker 1>like I always feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I love the society we live in and </v>

2720
02:04:32.081 --> 02:04:35.171
<v Speaker 1>this whole system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not the system that I've </v>

2721
02:04:35.171 --> 02:04:37.980
<v Speaker 1>designed for myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'd love to go back 10,000</v>

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:08.850
<v Speaker 1>funny expression going walk about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a funny expression.</v>

2734
02:05:08.970 --> 02:05:10.140
<v Speaker 1>Walkabout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2735
02:05:10.150 --> 02:05:14.970
<v Speaker 1>Just because I would take him so far to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get from wherever they were,</v>

2736
02:05:15.020 --> 02:05:16.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I travel a lot.</v>

2737
02:05:16.850 --> 02:05:18.240
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's actually,</v>

2738
02:05:18.430 --> 02:05:23.430
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's some hard evidence now </v>

2739
02:05:23.430 --> 02:05:25.260
<v Speaker 1>that indigenous Australians because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was symbols like right down on the</v>

2740
02:05:25.261 --> 02:05:28.500
<v Speaker 1>east coast of Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same exact symbols go all the way up</v>

2741
02:05:28.501 --> 02:05:29.970
<v Speaker 1>the coast to the northern territory.</v>

2742
02:05:29.970 --> 02:05:34.050
<v Speaker 1>This is a five day drive by the way that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the indigenous would walk that,</v>

2743
02:05:34.460 --> 02:05:35.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

2744
02:05:36.360 --> 02:05:39.840
<v Speaker 1>so walk about like Kevin used to walk </v>
<v Speaker 1>from community.</v>

2745
02:05:39.980 --> 02:05:43.560
<v Speaker 1>So that's built by the Australian </v>
<v Speaker 1>government to housing indigenous people.</v>

2746
02:05:43.860 --> 02:05:46.800
<v Speaker 1>Then they also have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we call it on country,</v>

2747
02:05:46.801 --> 02:05:51.801
<v Speaker 1>but I'm like at our community Jesper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's mob on his land,</v>

2748
02:05:52.021 --> 02:05:54.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kevin's a traditional owner just,</v>

2749
02:05:54.341 --> 02:05:55.490
<v Speaker 1>but he's Milan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's land.</v>

2750
02:05:55.810 --> 02:06:00.810
<v Speaker 1>They would walk that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would take them five days to walk it </v>

2751
02:06:00.810 --> 02:06:03.740
<v Speaker 1>and then so if they went out on country </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a while and haunted and stuff like </v>

2752
02:06:03.740 --> 02:06:03.740
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which side?</v>

2753
02:06:03.740 --> 02:06:08.051
<v Speaker 1>I spend another 20 or 30 days out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe longer than another five days </v>

2754
02:06:08.051 --> 02:06:11.811
<v Speaker 1>walk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see why they called it a </v>

2755
02:06:11.811 --> 02:06:11.811
<v Speaker 1>walkabout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That disappeared.</v>

2756
02:06:11.811 --> 02:06:14.901
<v Speaker 1>And that's how the science come up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you go away for a long time is </v>

2757
02:06:14.901 --> 02:06:17.110
<v Speaker 1>you've gone and walk about because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>literally walk that distance,</v>

2758
02:06:17.111 --> 02:06:21.120
<v Speaker 1>they'd be out on country for certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of period and then come back.</v>

2759
02:06:21.600 --> 02:06:24.120
<v Speaker 1>So that's why I've sort of adopted as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2760
02:06:24.121 --> 02:06:27.570
<v Speaker 1>like when I go walkabout walkabout on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chemo,</v>

2761
02:06:27.571 --> 02:06:28.020
<v Speaker 1>fair bit.</v>

2762
02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:34.470
<v Speaker 1>The idea of driving five days that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>could walk it.</v>

2763
02:06:34.800 --> 02:06:39.800
<v Speaker 1>And now these are different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you were talking about all the </v>

2764
02:06:39.800 --> 02:06:40.140
<v Speaker 1>different dialects and different tribes </v>
<v Speaker 1>of people.</v>

2765
02:06:40.500 --> 02:06:44.950
<v Speaker 1>Now what the hell did they do with they </v>
<v Speaker 1>encountered sometimes I'd have that.</v>

2766
02:06:45.060 --> 02:06:47.360
<v Speaker 1>They'd be war and stuff like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>between truck,</v>

2767
02:06:47.430 --> 02:06:52.430
<v Speaker 1>between mobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd be war and things like that </v>

2768
02:06:52.430 --> 02:06:54.711
<v Speaker 1>because that I think in most cases </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd try and avoid it and they'd have </v>

2769
02:06:54.711 --> 02:06:55.680
<v Speaker 1>like their corridor that they walk </v>
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>

2770
02:06:55.681 --> 02:06:58.560
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all had their own land.</v>

2771
02:06:58.561 --> 02:07:03.561
<v Speaker 1>What they sort of pretty much caught.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't say they all had their own lane </v>

2772
02:07:03.561 --> 02:07:04.380
<v Speaker 1>because there's so many indigenous mobs </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2773
02:07:05.240 --> 02:07:10.240
<v Speaker 1>And there was so many differences </v>
<v Speaker 1>between them that some of them would </v>

2774
02:07:10.240 --> 02:07:10.240
<v Speaker 1>just pure nomadic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2775
02:07:10.240 --> 02:07:12.090
<v Speaker 1>And just just have written language.</v>

2776
02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:20.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they've written language </v>

2777
02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:23.360
<v Speaker 1>freaking don't quote me on this was like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dream time and the paintings and </v>

2778
02:07:23.360 --> 02:07:24.900
<v Speaker 1>everything like that and everyone tells </v>
<v Speaker 1>him a story.</v>

2779
02:07:25.170 --> 02:07:30.170
<v Speaker 1>What's getting lost is it's only the </v>
<v Speaker 1>traditional elders that know those </v>

2780
02:07:30.170 --> 02:07:30.750
<v Speaker 1>stories and they got to pass it on to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the next generation.</v>

2781
02:07:31.050 --> 02:07:33.270
<v Speaker 1>So this is their story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is their paintings,</v>

2782
02:07:33.271 --> 02:07:38.271
<v Speaker 1>this is how the story goes when it gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>lost is when the mall essentially dies </v>

2783
02:07:39.821 --> 02:07:40.910
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2784
02:07:41.180 --> 02:07:43.930
<v Speaker 1>or it's not passed on down through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>generations.</v>

2785
02:07:44.350 --> 02:07:49.350
<v Speaker 1>That's just so crazy that there's this </v>
<v Speaker 1>enormous population of people and their </v>

2786
02:07:49.350 --> 02:07:49.990
<v Speaker 1>stories not being told.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2787
02:07:50.020 --> 02:07:55.020
<v Speaker 1>it seems sad when I think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In one sense it seems really sad,</v>

2788
02:07:55.480 --> 02:08:00.480
<v Speaker 1>but in another sense it shouldn't matter</v>
<v Speaker 1>to anyone else because it's just those </v>

2789
02:08:00.480 --> 02:08:02.620
<v Speaker 1>people's language and their stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if they die,</v>

2790
02:08:02.621 --> 02:08:03.940
<v Speaker 1>it's gone with them anyway.</v>

2791
02:08:04.210 --> 02:08:05.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean it's still,</v>

2792
02:08:05.680 --> 02:08:09.400
<v Speaker 1>just for the historical record,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it'd be great for human,</v>

2793
02:08:09.650 --> 02:08:14.650
<v Speaker 1>just a human life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Definitely to understand that this is a </v>

2794
02:08:14.650 --> 02:08:14.650
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2795
02:08:14.650 --> 02:08:17.110
<v Speaker 1>a very little understood group of human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings.</v>

2796
02:08:17.140 --> 02:08:19.900
<v Speaker 1>Don't you height that the mystery is </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting taken out of everything though,</v>

2797
02:08:21.610 --> 02:08:23.980
<v Speaker 1>like it's good to have all that </v>
<v Speaker 1>information,</v>

2798
02:08:23.981 --> 02:08:28.981
<v Speaker 1>like go on Google and find out frigging </v>
<v Speaker 1>the age of the last ice age or something</v>

2799
02:08:29.411 --> 02:08:34.411
<v Speaker 1>like that and which is awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also cancels out all the mystery.</v>

2800
02:08:34.481 --> 02:08:39.481
<v Speaker 1>Like we know that there's no other sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of monster crocodile in the waters </v>

2801
02:08:39.481 --> 02:08:43.610
<v Speaker 1>anymore because the whole world's like </v>
<v Speaker 1>right at our fingertips instead of being</v>

2802
02:08:43.611 --> 02:08:45.630
<v Speaker 1>a hoe out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have that mystery in their mind.</v>

2803
02:08:45.631 --> 02:08:45.980
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2804
02:08:45.981 --> 02:08:48.160
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what's out the back there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

2805
02:08:48.161 --> 02:08:51.430
<v Speaker 1>And that's why I feel like there's no </v>
<v Speaker 1>more last frontiers.</v>

2806
02:08:51.431 --> 02:08:56.431
<v Speaker 1>I love Colon Arnhem Land,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last frontier in places like </v>

2807
02:08:56.431 --> 02:08:57.190
<v Speaker 1>Northwest Territories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last frontier because there's hardly</v>

2808
02:08:57.191 --> 02:09:02.191
<v Speaker 1>any humans out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the truth is it's all been </v>

2809
02:09:02.191 --> 02:09:02.191
<v Speaker 1>discovered.</v>

2810
02:09:02.191 --> 02:09:06.240
<v Speaker 1>It's all pretty much been documented </v>
<v Speaker 1>pipe that you got some like real </v>

2811
02:09:06.240 --> 02:09:08.290
<v Speaker 1>wanderlust dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got side type shit.</v>

2812
02:09:09.220 --> 02:09:11.470
<v Speaker 1>That's why I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish I could go back in.</v>

2813
02:09:11.590 --> 02:09:15.490
<v Speaker 1>Like there's no way to discover anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Stuart Macdonald,</v>

2814
02:09:15.491 --> 02:09:20.491
<v Speaker 1>who's he?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was an alcoholic buddy who's a a is </v>

2815
02:09:20.491 --> 02:09:24.240
<v Speaker 1>actually a real famous early explorer </v>
<v Speaker 1>that come into Australia and Australia </v>

2816
02:09:24.371 --> 02:09:26.650
<v Speaker 1>was convinced all the people of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Adelaide,</v>

2817
02:09:27.100 --> 02:09:28.990
<v Speaker 1>we're convinced that's where the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>settlements were,</v>

2818
02:09:28.991 --> 02:09:33.991
<v Speaker 1>that there was an inland ocean in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia because there's all these </v>

2819
02:09:33.991 --> 02:09:38.491
<v Speaker 1>rivers running out from the center of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia and it couldn't be the </v>

2820
02:09:38.491 --> 02:09:39.040
<v Speaker 1>opposite as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's whole fucking desert,</v>

2821
02:09:39.280 --> 02:09:44.280
<v Speaker 1>but they walk in and out of there so </v>
<v Speaker 1>many times and so many men died and a </v>

2822
02:09:44.280 --> 02:09:49.080
<v Speaker 1>Mcdonald's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stuart himself nearly died a couple of </v>

2823
02:09:49.080 --> 02:09:50.590
<v Speaker 1>times from starvation and no water </v>
<v Speaker 1>because now walking into the desert.</v>

2824
02:09:50.980 --> 02:09:55.980
<v Speaker 1>In the end he was successful and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>ended up walking all the way through to </v>

2825
02:09:56.351 --> 02:09:57.220
<v Speaker 1>the top of Australia.</v>

2826
02:09:57.220 --> 02:10:02.220
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no fucking water until you get </v>

2827
02:10:02.220 --> 02:10:03.020
<v Speaker 1>to the top of Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did he get through it,</v>

2828
02:10:03.180 --> 02:10:08.180
<v Speaker 1>but imagine being back then when there </v>
<v Speaker 1>was all that mystery there was that you </v>

2829
02:10:08.180 --> 02:10:12.751
<v Speaker 1>were thinking that there was an inland </v>
<v Speaker 1>ocean in Australia because of these </v>

2830
02:10:12.751 --> 02:10:13.500
<v Speaker 1>rivers running out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but those rivers are ancient rivers.</v>

2831
02:10:13.520 --> 02:10:18.520
<v Speaker 1>They're millions of years old and for so</v>
<v Speaker 1>many hundreds of thousand years I </v>

2832
02:10:18.520 --> 02:10:20.630
<v Speaker 1>haven't even ran on top of the surface.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They run onto the sand,</v>

2833
02:10:20.631 --> 02:10:24.490
<v Speaker 1>didn't the rocks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was rivers so crazy to think.</v>

2834
02:10:24.610 --> 02:10:29.020
<v Speaker 1>But at some of the stories is um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got an awesome book.</v>

2835
02:10:29.730 --> 02:10:34.730
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't have an awesome book because </v>

2836
02:10:34.730 --> 02:10:34.730
<v Speaker 1>he's long gone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's an awesome book.</v>

2837
02:10:34.730 --> 02:10:38.180
<v Speaker 1>Erin called Mr Stewart track and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's one point [inaudible] </v>

2838
02:10:38.330 --> 02:10:43.330
<v Speaker 1>indigenous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they had never encountered the </v>

2839
02:10:43.330 --> 02:10:45.131
<v Speaker 1>indigenous and things like that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They walk into the center of Australia </v>

2840
02:10:45.131 --> 02:10:45.440
<v Speaker 1>where it was highly populated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>indigenous people.</v>

2841
02:10:45.470 --> 02:10:50.470
<v Speaker 1>No white people had ever been in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no settlers before that were literally </v>

2842
02:10:50.470 --> 02:10:52.040
<v Speaker 1>cutting the first tracks and drawing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>maps dude.</v>

2843
02:10:52.700 --> 02:10:57.640
<v Speaker 1>And like they walk in the one spot and </v>
<v Speaker 1>like they,</v>

2844
02:10:57.670 --> 02:10:59.780
<v Speaker 1>they had been three days or something </v>
<v Speaker 1>without water.</v>

2845
02:10:59.781 --> 02:11:03.170
<v Speaker 1>Like they are on the brink of death and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2846
02:11:03.360 --> 02:11:06.230
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like a miracle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like a little well out there,</v>

2847
02:11:06.231 --> 02:11:11.231
<v Speaker 1>like a clay built well out in the middle</v>
<v Speaker 1>of nowhere and it's got this crystal </v>

2848
02:11:11.231 --> 02:11:14.591
<v Speaker 1>clear water in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They keep the cattle and horses at bike </v>

2849
02:11:14.591 --> 02:11:17.870
<v Speaker 1>because Katelyn horses would smell the </v>
<v Speaker 1>water and just go in there and trash it </v>

2850
02:11:17.870 --> 02:11:21.221
<v Speaker 1>before the man could get there so they </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep the cattle and horses that by that </v>

2851
02:11:21.221 --> 02:11:23.460
<v Speaker 1>going if they on canteens and fill them </v>
<v Speaker 1>up and drink and you know,</v>

2852
02:11:23.461 --> 02:11:25.820
<v Speaker 1>all the manager just getting as much </v>
<v Speaker 1>water as I can.</v>

2853
02:11:26.330 --> 02:11:31.330
<v Speaker 1>Then they've let the horses and cattle </v>
<v Speaker 1>go so they can have a drink now.</v>

2854
02:11:31.790 --> 02:11:34.580
<v Speaker 1>The horses and cattle come in there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they trampled his whole.</v>

2855
02:11:34.581 --> 02:11:39.581
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it ends up going back to dust </v>

2856
02:11:39.581 --> 02:11:39.581
<v Speaker 1>because I gave it all in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They drink as much water as I can,</v>

2857
02:11:39.581 --> 02:11:43.160
<v Speaker 1>like have it all in and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the water pretty much dissipates.</v>

2858
02:11:43.850 --> 02:11:48.850
<v Speaker 1>Then they ride out for three or four </v>
<v Speaker 1>days and they can't find water and </v>

2859
02:11:48.921 --> 02:11:50.690
<v Speaker 1>they've run out of the water that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>collected there.</v>

2860
02:11:51.050 --> 02:11:54.620
<v Speaker 1>They turned back to there and it might </v>
<v Speaker 1>have even been longer.</v>

2861
02:11:54.621 --> 02:11:59.621
<v Speaker 1>It might have been a couple of weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might have been on the way back off </v>

2862
02:11:59.621 --> 02:12:02.161
<v Speaker 1>the not being able to go any further.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I come back there and there's all </v>

2863
02:12:02.161 --> 02:12:06.521
<v Speaker 1>these aborigines said dead because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>aborigines were the ones that would put </v>

2864
02:12:06.521 --> 02:12:09.080
<v Speaker 1>the willingness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They walked days and days and they would</v>

2865
02:12:09.081 --> 02:12:13.670
<v Speaker 1>just have a water source at the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>point that just go.</v>

2866
02:12:13.670 --> 02:12:15.830
<v Speaker 1>They knew water was there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They drink that,</v>

2867
02:12:15.900 --> 02:12:17.510
<v Speaker 1>be able to make it the next three or </v>
<v Speaker 1>four days.</v>

2868
02:12:17.530 --> 02:12:19.430
<v Speaker 1>The next bit of water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get there.</v>

2869
02:12:19.820 --> 02:12:22.250
<v Speaker 1>It's fully caved in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't get to the water.</v>

2870
02:12:22.251 --> 02:12:25.500
<v Speaker 1>There's a whole mob of indigenous people</v>
<v Speaker 1>dead there.</v>

2871
02:12:25.501 --> 02:12:30.501
<v Speaker 1>They.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They knew they couldn't go on any </v>

2872
02:12:30.501 --> 02:12:30.501
<v Speaker 1>further or at least all the ones that </v>
<v Speaker 1>were dead.</v>

2873
02:12:30.501 --> 02:12:33.860
<v Speaker 1>They knew they couldn't go on any </v>
<v Speaker 1>further and a dog are there and there </v>

2874
02:12:33.860 --> 02:12:35.030
<v Speaker 1>was no water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no world there anymore.</v>

2875
02:12:35.060 --> 02:12:40.060
<v Speaker 1>Like the catalog just trampled it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one thing like as if that's not </v>

2876
02:12:40.060 --> 02:12:43.991
<v Speaker 1>crazy enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one thing that I always think about </v>

2877
02:12:43.991 --> 02:12:46.660
<v Speaker 1>is I'm imagining the indigenous people </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming across these who've prints like </v>

2878
02:12:46.941 --> 02:12:48.320
<v Speaker 1>that because there's nothing in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia.</v>

2879
02:12:48.640 --> 02:12:53.640
<v Speaker 1>You've got to think they're the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals running around in Australia </v>

2880
02:12:53.640 --> 02:12:53.640
<v Speaker 1>would like Kangaroos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

2881
02:12:53.640 --> 02:12:55.160
<v Speaker 1>I'd have these little toad legs.</v>

2882
02:12:55.220 --> 02:13:00.220
<v Speaker 1>And then they come across these massive </v>
<v Speaker 1>prints for the first time that had just </v>

2883
02:13:00.220 --> 02:13:01.790
<v Speaker 1>devastated their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last drink and hall before they move</v>

2884
02:13:01.791 --> 02:13:04.700
<v Speaker 1>onto the next place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crazy stories in this book.</v>

2885
02:13:04.850 --> 02:13:08.090
<v Speaker 1>So there's no way to dig down deeper to </v>
<v Speaker 1>restart the.</v>

2886
02:13:08.091 --> 02:13:08.840
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

2887
02:13:08.841 --> 02:13:10.450
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess at that point yet.</v>

2888
02:13:10.451 --> 02:13:15.451
<v Speaker 1>So you're already so dehydrated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're walking to a point that you </v>

2889
02:13:15.451 --> 02:13:19.331
<v Speaker 1>think that there's water because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>build a well and then there's not </v>

2890
02:13:19.331 --> 02:13:19.530
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not that idea.</v>

2891
02:13:19.580 --> 02:13:22.310
<v Speaker 1>Very much debt they would've given up </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they are hottie people.</v>

2892
02:13:22.311 --> 02:13:27.311
<v Speaker 1>But whatever they tried to do obviously </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't enough fucking white people know.</v>

2893
02:13:28.580 --> 02:13:31.980
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that horrible story why people </v>
<v Speaker 1>ruin everything?</v>

2894
02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:36.060
<v Speaker 3>I hate to say we've done a lot of good </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought wrong of white people.</v>

2895
02:13:36.290 --> 02:13:37.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

2896
02:13:37.580 --> 02:13:41.870
<v Speaker 1>but so I see the mystery behind fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>just walking into the center,</v>

2897
02:13:42.190 --> 02:13:44.600
<v Speaker 1>even though it's a horrible mystery to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go through,</v>

2898
02:13:44.940 --> 02:13:45.770
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I mean.</v>

2899
02:13:45.771 --> 02:13:50.771
<v Speaker 1>At least a haven has done at the Di in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the middle of Australia thinking I'm </v>

2900
02:13:50.771 --> 02:13:54.401
<v Speaker 1>going to go when they fish and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>an inland ocean in somewhere and they </v>

2901
02:13:54.401 --> 02:13:54.401
<v Speaker 1>never come across it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're at the middle of the desert,</v>

2902
02:13:54.401 --> 02:13:57.880
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time it takes away from </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the mystery in life at it</v>

2903
02:13:58.150 --> 02:14:01.750
<v Speaker 3>things way different than me because you</v>
<v Speaker 3>have that wanderlust.</v>

2904
02:14:01.860 --> 02:14:02.620
<v Speaker 3>Got You.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have that.</v>

2905
02:14:02.621 --> 02:14:05.300
<v Speaker 3>I want to go out and find the hidden </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

2906
02:14:05.330 --> 02:14:06.620
<v Speaker 3>I don't have any of that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2907
02:14:06.880 --> 02:14:07.720
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2908
02:14:07.750 --> 02:14:09.790
<v Speaker 3>where's the water?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2909
02:14:09.791 --> 02:14:09.980
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2910
02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:11.020
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Show me on a map.</v>

2911
02:14:11.080 --> 02:14:12.010
<v Speaker 3>Where's the water?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2912
02:14:12.290 --> 02:14:12.920
<v Speaker 3>Where?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

2913
02:14:12.960 --> 02:14:15.310
<v Speaker 3>What kind of equipment do we need?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are we doing?</v>

2914
02:14:15.311 --> 02:14:20.311
<v Speaker 3>Do we have backup gun?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We get charged like you and I are very </v>

2915
02:14:21.521 --> 02:14:24.280
<v Speaker 3>different in that regard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no desire to go to uncharted</v>

2916
02:14:24.540 --> 02:14:26.480
<v Speaker 1>towards Reiki.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

2917
02:14:26.490 --> 02:14:31.490
<v Speaker 1>The risk that's appealing was just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanderlust.</v>

2918
02:14:32.550 --> 02:14:36.120
<v Speaker 1>It must be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just put your finger on that last.</v>

2919
02:14:36.980 --> 02:14:41.070
<v Speaker 1>That cave system that you put a picture </v>
<v Speaker 1>up of before that I took photos of a lot</v>

2920
02:14:41.071 --> 02:14:45.060
<v Speaker 1>of people have asked like where is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for me personally,</v>

2921
02:14:45.061 --> 02:14:50.061
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to keep that undocumented </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it seems once a place is known </v>

2922
02:14:50.061 --> 02:14:50.970
<v Speaker 1>as no different than a good fishing or </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting spot,</v>

2923
02:14:51.160 --> 02:14:54.570
<v Speaker 1>it gets fucking ruined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that cave system,</v>

2924
02:14:54.600 --> 02:14:57.520
<v Speaker 1>for starters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not up to me because you know,</v>

2925
02:14:57.540 --> 02:15:01.800
<v Speaker 1>that'd be up to the traditional owners </v>
<v Speaker 1>to want to put that out there for people</v>

2926
02:15:01.801 --> 02:15:03.120
<v Speaker 1>to go and look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not up to me,</v>

2927
02:15:03.121 --> 02:15:06.120
<v Speaker 1>so I can't share that information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for me personally,</v>

2928
02:15:06.121 --> 02:15:11.121
<v Speaker 1>I don't want that to be documented </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I know as soon as it's </v>

2929
02:15:11.121 --> 02:15:11.121
<v Speaker 1>documented,</v>
<v Speaker 1>robish will shop there.</v>

2930
02:15:11.121 --> 02:15:16.040
<v Speaker 1>Some decades will shop there and spray </v>
<v Speaker 1>paint or scribble on rule one or some </v>

2931
02:15:16.040 --> 02:15:20.961
<v Speaker 1>shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some places are better off on </v>

2932
02:15:20.961 --> 02:15:21.560
<v Speaker 1>undocumented.</v>

2933
02:15:21.580 --> 02:15:26.580
<v Speaker 3>Well we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the human race has got to evolve past </v>

2934
02:15:26.580 --> 02:15:28.240
<v Speaker 3>that and that's a big order.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously that's a very tall order.</v>

2935
02:15:28.241 --> 02:15:29.700
<v Speaker 3>But God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've got to evolve past</v>

2936
02:15:29.730 --> 02:15:34.730
<v Speaker 1>set a fucking white dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's good people and bad people for </v>

2937
02:15:34.730 --> 02:15:34.730
<v Speaker 1>the donut man.</v>

2938
02:15:34.730 --> 02:15:36.790
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think there's more good people now</v>

2939
02:15:36.791 --> 02:15:41.791
<v Speaker 3>than ever before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Definitely more informed people now </v>

2940
02:15:41.791 --> 02:15:42.820
<v Speaker 3>where before we just got to keep </v>
<v Speaker 3>progressing along the same lines.</v>

2941
02:15:42.821 --> 02:15:44.950
<v Speaker 3>And I think that that progress is </v>
<v Speaker 3>accelerating.</v>

2942
02:15:45.180 --> 02:15:50.180
<v Speaker 3>And I would just hope that more people </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the future would have more </v>

2943
02:15:50.180 --> 02:15:53.341
<v Speaker 3>appreciation for what that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is just like this incredible historical </v>

2944
02:15:53.341 --> 02:15:57.481
<v Speaker 3>resource.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you seeing these mean we're talking </v>

2945
02:15:57.481 --> 02:15:59.821
<v Speaker 3>about 65,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years of people in this area and who </v>

2946
02:15:59.821 --> 02:16:00.790
<v Speaker 3>knows how old those paintings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could be thousands of years old,</v>

2947
02:16:00.791 --> 02:16:01.160
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2948
02:16:01.320 --> 02:16:03.420
<v Speaker 3>has anybody done leg or carbon dating on</v>
<v Speaker 3>them?</v>

2949
02:16:03.690 --> 02:16:08.690
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure there has been a bunch of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They find those in Texas sometimes from </v>

2950
02:16:09.491 --> 02:16:13.390
<v Speaker 3>native Americans to find them in caves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just find a cave system.</v>

2951
02:16:13.391 --> 02:16:15.010
<v Speaker 3>And then you just encountered these </v>
<v Speaker 3>pictures.</v>

2952
02:16:15.270 --> 02:16:17.850
<v Speaker 1>I was hunting in New Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2953
02:16:18.220 --> 02:16:19.430
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we saw,</v>

2954
02:16:19.431 --> 02:16:23.390
<v Speaker 1>I tagged out and then like I didn't want</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hunt and the hunt was done.</v>

2955
02:16:23.391 --> 02:16:24.740
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have any tags lift.</v>

2956
02:16:25.010 --> 02:16:27.380
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want the experience to end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2957
02:16:27.440 --> 02:16:29.650
<v Speaker 1>that's why I say it's never ever been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2958
02:16:29.651 --> 02:16:31.840
<v Speaker 1>just killing an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about the whole adventure,</v>

2959
02:16:31.841 --> 02:16:33.940
<v Speaker 1>the whole package.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2960
02:16:33.960 --> 02:16:36.310
<v Speaker 1>I was with an outfitter and the guides </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2961
02:16:36.311 --> 02:16:37.000
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you tagged out,</v>

2962
02:16:37.001 --> 02:16:37.810
<v Speaker 1>what do you want to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2963
02:16:37.811 --> 02:16:40.120
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go explore it and go walk.</v>

2964
02:16:40.121 --> 02:16:42.190
<v Speaker 1>And steel and just take photos of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>

2965
02:16:42.191 --> 02:16:44.020
<v Speaker 1>saw it or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2966
02:16:44.200 --> 02:16:46.810
<v Speaker 1>you put that all up on your blog to </v>
<v Speaker 1>write it in a magazine,</v>

2967
02:16:47.260 --> 02:16:52.260
<v Speaker 1>a magazine that one on there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Read that actually it might be on both </v>

2968
02:16:52.260 --> 02:16:52.260
<v Speaker 1>sides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dot Com.</v>

2969
02:16:52.260 --> 02:16:55.750
<v Speaker 1>I think I did a live one anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go up on top of these Mesa and uh,</v>

2970
02:16:55.751 --> 02:17:00.751
<v Speaker 1>you can see these rock a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a huge rock and new shakes which </v>

2971
02:17:00.751 --> 02:17:02.770
<v Speaker 1>used to be like the Anasazi Indians.</v>

2972
02:17:02.890 --> 02:17:05.170
<v Speaker 1>That's how I used to have their housing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and stuff like that.</v>

2973
02:17:05.560 --> 02:17:08.800
<v Speaker 1>Perfect spot right up high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Looking down onto these big meadows.</v>

2974
02:17:08.801 --> 02:17:12.790
<v Speaker 1>Like it would've been the perfect place </v>
<v Speaker 1>to if other tribes were coming in,</v>

2975
02:17:13.030 --> 02:17:18.030
<v Speaker 1>you'd be able to say them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if any animals working for moving </v>

2976
02:17:18.030 --> 02:17:21.271
<v Speaker 1>through there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be able to see them just the </v>

2977
02:17:21.271 --> 02:17:21.271
<v Speaker 1>perfect spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we'd get up there.</v>

2978
02:17:21.271 --> 02:17:24.990
<v Speaker 1>And as I get to the top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing you find is a bunch of </v>

2979
02:17:24.990 --> 02:17:24.990
<v Speaker 1>pottery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2980
02:17:24.990 --> 02:17:29.580
<v Speaker 1>the Anasazi had a certain color,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was the white with the black </v>

2981
02:17:29.580 --> 02:17:33.840
<v Speaker 1>writing on the pottery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Navajos had the orange with the </v>

2982
02:17:33.840 --> 02:17:36.820
<v Speaker 1>white writing on the pottery and there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>both types sitting in this area,</v>

2983
02:17:36.821 --> 02:17:41.821
<v Speaker 1>so I don't know if there's a bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>confusion or maybe I'm lacking a bit of </v>

2984
02:17:41.821 --> 02:17:42.090
<v Speaker 1>information there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as far as I've looked into those,</v>

2985
02:17:42.100 --> 02:17:45.570
<v Speaker 1>the Anasazi Indians and it's the hallway</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

2986
02:17:45.571 --> 02:17:47.560
<v Speaker 1>and they liked this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>must've been some major.</v>

2987
02:17:47.560 --> 02:17:51.070
<v Speaker 1>Saw it dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found a perfect stone.</v>

2988
02:17:51.090 --> 02:17:56.050
<v Speaker 1>Broadhead just sitting right there on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>rock and it just rained.</v>

2989
02:17:56.051 --> 02:17:58.540
<v Speaker 1>So everything was clean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything was clean.</v>

2990
02:17:58.930 --> 02:18:01.630
<v Speaker 1>I picked it up and like my mind boggled </v>
<v Speaker 1>straight away.</v>

2991
02:18:01.631 --> 02:18:04.540
<v Speaker 1>Like why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did this get here?</v>

2992
02:18:04.541 --> 02:18:06.430
<v Speaker 1>Who held it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did they shoot it?</v>

2993
02:18:06.460 --> 02:18:08.440
<v Speaker 1>Who Shop?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the history behind it.</v>

2994
02:18:09.040 --> 02:18:12.220
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then so we kept walking around.</v>

2995
02:18:12.610 --> 02:18:16.150
<v Speaker 1>I found a full ax head dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like obviously the team has gone off the</v>

2996
02:18:16.151 --> 02:18:18.800
<v Speaker 1>ax because it's been there for so long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The team has just brought it,</v>

2997
02:18:18.870 --> 02:18:20.920
<v Speaker 1>the nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ax hates sitting there.</v>

2998
02:18:20.921 --> 02:18:23.110
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We ended up finding three ax heads,</v>

2999
02:18:23.430 --> 02:18:24.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indian pendant,</v>

3000
02:18:25.090 --> 02:18:30.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the perfect little hole like scribed </v>

3001
02:18:30.090 --> 02:18:30.090
<v Speaker 1>in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And just like crazy.</v>

3002
02:18:30.090 --> 02:18:35.041
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you bring that bag with you because </v>

3003
02:18:35.041 --> 02:18:35.041
<v Speaker 1>it was privately handles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was able to take it.</v>

3004
02:18:35.041 --> 02:18:36.480
<v Speaker 1>You take a photo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the of the uh,</v>

3005
02:18:36.800 --> 02:18:37.680
<v Speaker 1>broadhead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

3006
02:18:37.870 --> 02:18:38.770
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All that document.</v>

3007
02:18:39.300 --> 02:18:44.300
<v Speaker 1>Those fascinate me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was nearly going to give you the </v>

3008
02:18:44.300 --> 02:18:44.300
<v Speaker 1>broadest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3009
02:18:44.300 --> 02:18:46.710
<v Speaker 1>that's taken it to fucking deserve it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can add the buffalo skull.</v>

3010
02:18:46.740 --> 02:18:51.740
<v Speaker 1>I shed a tear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just pot with that buffalo skull and </v>

3011
02:18:51.740 --> 02:18:52.780
<v Speaker 1>buffalo skills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>

3012
02:18:53.210 --> 02:18:58.210
<v Speaker 1>They will mean something to Bert was </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying today.</v>

3013
02:18:58.390 --> 02:19:03.390
<v Speaker 1>He killed the dog.</v>

3014
02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.690
<v Speaker 1>The cat things freaks people out about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia.</v>

3015
02:19:12.691 --> 02:19:17.691
<v Speaker 1>That dog freaks people out as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's no different than shooting a </v>

3016
02:19:17.691 --> 02:19:20.860
<v Speaker 1>coyote here a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Animal dingoes will one of the first.</v>

3017
02:19:20.950 --> 02:19:25.950
<v Speaker 1>They believe one of the first introduced</v>
<v Speaker 1>species in Australia and it come with </v>

3018
02:19:25.950 --> 02:19:27.260
<v Speaker 1>the indigenous population at some point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3019
02:19:27.261 --> 02:19:28.100
<v Speaker 1>so they came with</v>

3020
02:19:28.110 --> 02:19:29.520
<v Speaker 2>indigenous people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

3021
02:19:29.600 --> 02:19:34.110
<v Speaker 2>So the indigenous people out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wild dogs is Dingo.</v>

3022
02:19:34.111 --> 02:19:39.111
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is most of them aren't dingoes anymore </v>

3023
02:19:39.111 --> 02:19:41.441
<v Speaker 2>because there's been a wild dog </v>
<v Speaker 2>population that's sort of peppered </v>

3024
02:19:41.441 --> 02:19:43.850
<v Speaker 2>through there as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dingoes and w and normal dogs,</v>

3025
02:19:43.851 --> 02:19:47.690
<v Speaker 2>like a domestic dog that's gone wild had</v>
<v Speaker 2>now in a bread and I,</v>

3026
02:19:47.840 --> 02:19:52.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure that any place you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>find a purebred Dingo now is on Fraser </v>

3027
02:19:52.840 --> 02:19:56.650
<v Speaker 2>Island in Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've got a policy or regulations that</v>

3028
02:19:56.651 --> 02:20:00.200
<v Speaker 2>is not allowed to be any domestic </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals taken to the island and also the</v>

3029
02:20:00.201 --> 02:20:02.930
<v Speaker 2>population stayed pure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

3030
02:20:03.320 --> 02:20:05.780
<v Speaker 2>So if you live there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't have a dog.</v>

3031
02:20:06.530 --> 02:20:08.180
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he can live on the island </v>
<v Speaker 2>at all.</v>

3032
02:20:08.330 --> 02:20:09.700
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of those things.</v>

3033
02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:15.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kind of weird rules about wade roses </v>

3034
02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:19.360
<v Speaker 2>that you can't hunt anything native.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's very strange to me that they </v>

3035
02:20:19.360 --> 02:20:19.820
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't just have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you have.</v>

3036
02:20:20.190 --> 02:20:24.140
<v Speaker 2>Kangaroos are on some of our currency,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they're like our icon.</v>

3037
02:20:24.141 --> 02:20:27.890
<v Speaker 2>So imagine eight annual Bodega,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like eight and year American icon.</v>

3038
02:20:28.420 --> 02:20:31.070
<v Speaker 2>So that's one way to look at it by </v>
<v Speaker 2>chicken,</v>

3039
02:20:31.100 --> 02:20:34.430
<v Speaker 2>but we kind of need a kid news all </v>
<v Speaker 2>frigging wombats or anything like that?</v>

3040
02:20:34.460 --> 02:20:36.050
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not that I'd probably want to,</v>

3041
02:20:36.290 --> 02:20:40.070
<v Speaker 2>but people do eat kangaroo though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I'm confused.</v>

3042
02:20:40.220 --> 02:20:42.410
<v Speaker 2>And the indigenous cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dingo big,</v>

3043
02:20:42.460 --> 02:20:43.810
<v Speaker 2>good looking dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She will,</v>

3044
02:20:43.811 --> 02:20:47.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that'd be Fraser Island dog.</v>

3045
02:20:47.580 --> 02:20:49.840
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a look at them on the lake.</v>

3046
02:20:51.940 --> 02:20:56.940
<v Speaker 2>It's a beautiful dog that feels like you</v>
<v Speaker 2>could take that thing as a puppy and </v>

3047
02:20:56.940 --> 02:20:56.940
<v Speaker 2>raise it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

3048
02:20:56.940 --> 02:21:00.510
<v Speaker 2>I've got a buddy who had one habit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>goatees little girl,</v>

3049
02:21:00.511 --> 02:21:05.511
<v Speaker 2>like try and grab these little go when </v>
<v Speaker 2>he had it as a puppy or not just a wild </v>

3050
02:21:05.540 --> 02:21:09.950
<v Speaker 2>one that come into the tent and tried to</v>
<v Speaker 2>grab him ripping a wallet down there.</v>

3051
02:21:10.790 --> 02:21:13.070
<v Speaker 2>So what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3052
02:21:14.180 --> 02:21:19.180
<v Speaker 2>he ended up killing the dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He founded the next morning and not </v>

3053
02:21:19.180 --> 02:21:22.320
<v Speaker 2>shooting it was a wall Dingo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Dingo ate my baby and I some truth </v>

3054
02:21:23.120 --> 02:21:24.440
<v Speaker 2>to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

3055
02:21:24.470 --> 02:21:26.720
<v Speaker 2>I've seen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How should they go fishing?</v>

3056
02:21:26.750 --> 02:21:31.750
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ while eating a shark on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>beach,</v>

3057
02:21:31.940 --> 02:21:36.940
<v Speaker 2>that theft fucking cool photo as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>gangster ass dog when it got a lot of </v>

3058
02:21:38.900 --> 02:21:41.990
<v Speaker 2>meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if someone actually call it the</v>

3059
02:21:41.991 --> 02:21:43.550
<v Speaker 2>shark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's another thing that people are</v>

3060
02:21:43.551 --> 02:21:44.980
<v Speaker 2>freaking out about it here in America.</v>

3061
02:21:45.020 --> 02:21:48.500
<v Speaker 2>It's most recent freakouts people </v>
<v Speaker 2>fishing and catching sharks.</v>

3062
02:21:48.950 --> 02:21:53.950
<v Speaker 2>Simon and strike that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It used to be able to buy Maaco Shark.</v>

3063
02:21:55.251 --> 02:22:00.251
<v Speaker 2>It was very common for most flake and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the stuff that you bond shock,</v>

3064
02:22:01.600 --> 02:22:03.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when you buy like a bad bit of fish</v>

3065
02:22:03.950 --> 02:22:06.980
<v Speaker 2>or something like that from one of them </v>
<v Speaker 2>quick type wise it does fish and chips.</v>

3066
02:22:07.790 --> 02:22:11.570
<v Speaker 2>Then most of that's actually flight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is just a shock really?</v>

3067
02:22:11.571 --> 02:22:12.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3069
02:22:12.640 --> 02:22:14.270
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Specific Australia?</v>

3070
02:22:14.330 --> 02:22:15.620
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I probably hate to.</v>

3071
02:22:15.710 --> 02:22:20.710
<v Speaker 2>Do you think they're serving a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>tapes of him and there's a ton of them </v>

3072
02:22:20.710 --> 02:22:24.110
<v Speaker 2>that get into next net.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where they go really taste good.</v>

3073
02:22:24.590 --> 02:22:26.580
<v Speaker 2>I've eaten Maaco sharp before and is </v>
<v Speaker 2>delicious.</v>

3074
02:22:26.581 --> 02:22:28.830
<v Speaker 2>And electric swordfish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the same as anything.</v>

3075
02:22:28.860 --> 02:22:30.720
<v Speaker 2>As long as we're not freaking killing a </v>
<v Speaker 2>male.</v>

3076
02:22:30.780 --> 02:22:32.790
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what happens is people find out</v>

3077
02:22:32.791 --> 02:22:34.860
<v Speaker 2>that a lot of people are killing them </v>
<v Speaker 2>for Finn's.</v>

3078
02:22:34.920 --> 02:22:39.920
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Warning your fish and chips could </v>

3079
02:22:39.920 --> 02:22:42.630
<v Speaker 2>actually be shark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Damn a bad motherfucker.</v>

3080
02:22:42.631 --> 02:22:45.540
<v Speaker 2>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is drying last nine Bogan.</v>

3081
02:22:46.080 --> 02:22:48.170
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

3082
02:22:48.280 --> 02:22:51.020
<v Speaker 2>good fit rod into Australia last night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like bogus.</v>

3083
02:22:51.420 --> 02:22:52.590
<v Speaker 2>Cashed up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bogans.</v>

3084
02:22:53.730 --> 02:22:55.730
<v Speaker 2>Did you tell me that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might have told me that expression.</v>

3085
02:22:56.280 --> 02:23:00.390
<v Speaker 2>Kim talking smack far so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3086
02:23:00.600 --> 02:23:05.600
<v Speaker 2>but I think what happened was over here </v>
<v Speaker 2>the people found out about how many </v>

3087
02:23:05.600 --> 02:23:09.411
<v Speaker 2>sharks get killed for the fins shark fin</v>
<v Speaker 2>soup and there was a big campaign to </v>

3088
02:23:09.411 --> 02:23:09.890
<v Speaker 2>alert people about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

3089
02:23:10.200 --> 02:23:15.200
<v Speaker 2>and so then the people that have just </v>
<v Speaker 2>barely a peripheral awareness of </v>

3090
02:23:15.200 --> 02:23:17.640
<v Speaker 2>conservation and fishing and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and animal life,</v>

3091
02:23:17.820 --> 02:23:20.190
<v Speaker 2>then they started going to kill sharks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sharks.</v>

3092
02:23:20.280 --> 02:23:22.500
<v Speaker 2>They're assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile they're eating a cod.</v>

3093
02:23:22.740 --> 02:23:27.740
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Having some salmon for lunch on the </v>

3094
02:23:27.740 --> 02:23:27.740
<v Speaker 2>salad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you eat this fish?</v>

3095
02:23:27.740 --> 02:23:29.190
<v Speaker 2>A shark called the dog fish makes it </v>
<v Speaker 2>tasty.</v>

3096
02:23:29.191 --> 02:23:29.760
<v Speaker 2>Taco.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3097
02:23:29.761 --> 02:23:31.050
<v Speaker 2>I need to fuck out of a dog.</v>

3098
02:23:31.060 --> 02:23:33.330
<v Speaker 2>Fish me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's still a fish.</v>

3099
02:23:33.390 --> 02:23:34.860
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not efficient shark,</v>

3100
02:23:34.861 --> 02:23:38.880
<v Speaker 2>but I just don't understand why people </v>
<v Speaker 2>would differentiate between that.</v>

3101
02:23:38.881 --> 02:23:41.180
<v Speaker 2>And tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about you assholes that really loves</v>

3102
02:23:41.181 --> 02:23:46.181
<v Speaker 2>Sushi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Back the fuck off of the tuna because </v>

3103
02:23:46.181 --> 02:23:46.800
<v Speaker 2>they're killing all the Goddamn tuna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's probably more sharks.</v>

3104
02:23:46.801 --> 02:23:48.150
<v Speaker 2>There are tuna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They.</v>

3105
02:23:48.430 --> 02:23:53.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some pretty strict regulations </v>

3106
02:23:53.430 --> 02:23:54.760
<v Speaker 2>in Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole world needs to know.</v>

3107
02:23:55.050 --> 02:23:58.440
<v Speaker 2>There's some regulations that have come </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the northern territory of Australia</v>

3108
02:23:58.441 --> 02:24:01.890
<v Speaker 2>now because you can actually shoot a </v>
<v Speaker 2>magpie geese with a bow and arrow.</v>

3109
02:24:02.250 --> 02:24:07.250
<v Speaker 2>So there's magpie geese and introduced </v>
<v Speaker 2>turkeys like what you guys have here in </v>

3110
02:24:07.250 --> 02:24:11.061
<v Speaker 2>the states,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're the only birds that you can </v>

3111
02:24:11.061 --> 02:24:11.061
<v Speaker 2>shoot with a bone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our window Australia.</v>

3112
02:24:11.061 --> 02:24:15.140
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they just brought in a season for </v>

3113
02:24:15.140 --> 02:24:15.450
<v Speaker 2>magpie geese,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which really restricts a lot of the.</v>

3114
02:24:15.451 --> 02:24:17.100
<v Speaker 2>Honda's taken too many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is fine.</v>

3115
02:24:17.190 --> 02:24:19.530
<v Speaker 2>I think that that's probably not a bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

3116
02:24:20.100 --> 02:24:25.100
<v Speaker 2>but then these birds fly to other </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries where there's no restrictions </v>

3117
02:24:25.100 --> 02:24:25.950
<v Speaker 2>at all and they just fucking get </v>
<v Speaker 2>hammered.</v>

3118
02:24:25.951 --> 02:24:30.951
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like we're doing everything we </v>

3119
02:24:30.951 --> 02:24:33.231
<v Speaker 2>can on our part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just go somewhere else and get </v>

3120
02:24:33.231 --> 02:24:33.231
<v Speaker 2>slower than any line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you don't understand.</v>

3121
02:24:33.280 --> 02:24:36.940
<v Speaker 2>No issues with the shocks as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they've,</v>

3122
02:24:37.370 --> 02:24:42.370
<v Speaker 2>there's a few spaces that are highly </v>
<v Speaker 2>protected in Australia but they swim </v>

3123
02:24:42.370 --> 02:24:45.320
<v Speaker 2>abroad and they fair game for anyone but</v>
<v Speaker 2>eats great whites though right now that </v>

3124
02:24:45.320 --> 02:24:49.761
<v Speaker 2>I know of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I guess people would if they were </v>

3125
02:24:49.761 --> 02:24:49.761
<v Speaker 2>starved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would for sure.</v>

3126
02:24:49.761 --> 02:24:53.270
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's probably just fish tastes pretty </v>

3127
02:24:53.270 --> 02:24:56.151
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that gave up too fucking </v>

3128
02:24:56.151 --> 02:24:57.951
<v Speaker 2>easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's another monster live and monster </v>

3129
02:24:57.951 --> 02:24:57.951
<v Speaker 2>dual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3130
02:24:57.951 --> 02:24:59.110
<v Speaker 2>Legit monster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3131
02:24:59.220 --> 02:25:04.220
<v Speaker 2>There was an instance in San Diego a few</v>
<v Speaker 2>years back were these bunch of these </v>

3132
02:25:04.220 --> 02:25:08.991
<v Speaker 2>people were training for a triathlon and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were swimming in the ocean and one </v>

3133
02:25:08.991 --> 02:25:08.991
<v Speaker 2>out of nowhere.</v>

3134
02:25:08.991 --> 02:25:13.980
<v Speaker 2>I just came and cut this guy and half of</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody else just bit him right at the</v>

3135
02:25:14.521 --> 02:25:19.521
<v Speaker 2>waist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This scary dude shot them right in half </v>

3136
02:25:19.521 --> 02:25:20.760
<v Speaker 2>chomp besides conserving their live </v>
<v Speaker 2>shark.</v>

3137
02:25:20.761 --> 02:25:25.761
<v Speaker 2>Meat can be terribly unhealthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>According to CNN report from nearly 20 </v>

3138
02:25:25.761 --> 02:25:29.310
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mercury levels in sharks can cause </v>

3139
02:25:29.310 --> 02:25:29.310
<v Speaker 2>coordination,</v>
<v Speaker 2>loss blindness,</v>

3140
02:25:29.310 --> 02:25:33.781
<v Speaker 2>and even deaths.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scientists think that sharks accumulate </v>

3141
02:25:33.781 --> 02:25:34.840
<v Speaker 2>mercury in their body because they eat </v>
<v Speaker 2>many smaller fish.</v>

3142
02:25:34.841 --> 02:25:37.480
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why you shouldn't eat shark meat.</v>

3143
02:25:37.960 --> 02:25:41.440
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't and have a lot of mercury in </v>
<v Speaker 2>it as well.</v>

3144
02:25:41.500 --> 02:25:42.760
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They say,</v>

3145
02:25:43.520 --> 02:25:46.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't like to eat Marlin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3146
02:25:46.421 --> 02:25:49.990
<v Speaker 2>but I've heard Marlin's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of those big fish,</v>

3147
02:25:49.991 --> 02:25:51.940
<v Speaker 2>especially the prey to the ones a full </v>
<v Speaker 2>of mercury.</v>

3148
02:25:52.020 --> 02:25:53.370
<v Speaker 2>Makes Sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3149
02:25:53.620 --> 02:25:57.130
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like predators in general </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a lot of weird things going on with</v>

3150
02:25:57.131 --> 02:26:02.131
<v Speaker 2>their body if you eat them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know like mountain lions can be </v>

3151
02:26:02.131 --> 02:26:02.131
<v Speaker 2>tricky.</v>

3152
02:26:02.131 --> 02:26:03.940
<v Speaker 2>GNOSIS interesting study like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it says at the top of the article,</v>

3153
02:26:03.970 --> 02:26:07.720
<v Speaker 2>an estimated 100 million sharks are </v>
<v Speaker 2>killed each year to feed consumer demand</v>

3154
02:26:07.770 --> 02:26:12.430
<v Speaker 2>and then the study came from a report of</v>
<v Speaker 2>a 124 sharks that were tested in.</v>

3155
02:26:12.431 --> 02:26:17.431
<v Speaker 2>One third of them came in with mercury </v>
<v Speaker 2>levels that were over FDA action level </v>

3156
02:26:17.431 --> 02:26:21.390
<v Speaker 2>of one part per million.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So 100 million sharks every year.</v>

3157
02:26:21.410 --> 02:26:24.970
<v Speaker 2>One hundred and 24 had a third of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>were problematic.</v>

3158
02:26:24.971 --> 02:26:29.620
<v Speaker 2>So 30 sharks were problematic or so 40 </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of how many.</v>

3159
02:26:29.650 --> 02:26:31.560
<v Speaker 2>But they didn't test that many though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3160
02:26:31.590 --> 02:26:34.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean they didn't test 100 million.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The tests at 140 were bad.</v>

3161
02:26:35.070 --> 02:26:35.890
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not good.</v>

3162
02:26:35.920 --> 02:26:38.260
<v Speaker 2>That's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's real bad you think?</v>

3163
02:26:38.290 --> 02:26:39.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's terrible.</v>

3164
02:26:39.900 --> 02:26:41.800
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't say maybe they were all one area</v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

3165
02:26:41.830 --> 02:26:44.170
<v Speaker 2>They could have came out of one shitty </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe area.</v>

3166
02:26:44.171 --> 02:26:47.650
<v Speaker 2>And I've told this story 100 times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'll say it again just quickly.</v>

3167
02:26:47.710 --> 02:26:52.710
<v Speaker 2>I had arsenic in my body from when I did</v>
<v Speaker 2>a blood test and he said,</v>

3168
02:26:53.080 --> 02:26:54.190
<v Speaker 2>what are you eating?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

3169
02:26:54.191 --> 02:26:56.410
<v Speaker 2>I eat a lot of sardines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the guy said,</v>

3170
02:26:56.411 --> 02:26:58.600
<v Speaker 2>back off the sardines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll try it again in a couple of weeks.</v>

3171
02:26:58.900 --> 02:27:02.760
<v Speaker 2>And the arsenic was gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eating two cans of Sardines Day.</v>

3172
02:27:02.770 --> 02:27:05.650
<v Speaker 2>I love sardines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why I like sardines on.</v>

3173
02:27:05.660 --> 02:27:07.220
<v Speaker 2>Totally love them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're great.</v>

3174
02:27:09.230 --> 02:27:11.140
<v Speaker 2>Came back road swordfish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

3175
02:27:11.340 --> 02:27:13.360
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do not eat shark swordfish.</v>

3176
02:27:13.361 --> 02:27:18.361
<v Speaker 2>King Mackerel or tile fish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they contain high levels of </v>

3177
02:27:18.361 --> 02:27:18.760
<v Speaker 2>mercury.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard that about tune as well.</v>

3178
02:27:18.850 --> 02:27:23.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't know those certain areas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some tuna apparently contains high </v>

3179
02:27:23.850 --> 02:27:28.621
<v Speaker 2>levels of mercury were assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was reading something about fucking </v>

3180
02:27:28.621 --> 02:27:31.780
<v Speaker 2>crabs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put it up on my twitter that crabs are</v>

3181
02:27:32.170 --> 02:27:37.170
<v Speaker 2>getting Prozac in the water from human </v>
<v Speaker 2>beings like because somebody fucking nut</v>

3182
02:27:37.751 --> 02:27:42.751
<v Speaker 2>bags are on Prozac that it's getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the oceans through runoff and it's </v>

3183
02:27:42.751 --> 02:27:44.410
<v Speaker 2>affecting crab behavior and it's making </v>
<v Speaker 2>crabs reckless.</v>

3184
02:27:44.760 --> 02:27:48.430
<v Speaker 2>And I already saved pretty fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>reckless.</v>

3185
02:27:48.740 --> 02:27:49.800
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're bugs.</v>

3186
02:27:50.020 --> 02:27:55.020
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But apparently it's making the reckless </v>

3187
02:27:55.020 --> 02:27:55.020
<v Speaker 2>area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It goes.</v>

3188
02:27:55.020 --> 02:27:58.180
<v Speaker 2>Roseanne,</v>
<v Speaker 2>puts crabs in a mood to take deadly </v>

3189
02:27:58.180 --> 02:27:59.920
<v Speaker 2>risks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shit that with me and Andrew Equals.</v>

3190
02:28:03.030 --> 02:28:05.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3191
02:28:05.111 --> 02:28:10.111
<v Speaker 2>how crazy is the human race where we are</v>
<v Speaker 2>giving PROZAC inadvertently to fucking </v>

3192
02:28:11.351 --> 02:28:16.351
<v Speaker 2>crabs and they're at a risk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apparently they're worried about the </v>

3193
02:28:16.930 --> 02:28:20.950
<v Speaker 2>population dying off or at least being </v>
<v Speaker 2>affected.</v>

3194
02:28:21.260 --> 02:28:21.980
<v Speaker 2>These crabs</v>

3195
02:28:22.280 --> 02:28:27.170
<v Speaker 3>are doing reckless things and it's going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to cause them to get preyed upon or die.</v>

3196
02:28:28.070 --> 02:28:29.630
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck man?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shit,</v>

3197
02:28:29.930 --> 02:28:33.020
<v Speaker 3>crap brains on Ssri.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what is that word?</v>

3198
02:28:33.110 --> 02:28:35.180
<v Speaker 3>How do you say that word?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie flew.</v>

3199
02:28:35.270 --> 02:28:40.270
<v Speaker 3>Locks is a class of antidepressant </v>
<v Speaker 3>called SSRI or selective serotonin </v>

3200
02:28:41.571 --> 02:28:44.390
<v Speaker 3>reuptake inhibitor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning that indirectly boosie amount of</v>

3201
02:28:44.391 --> 02:28:46.580
<v Speaker 3>mood altering serotonin available to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>brain.</v>

3202
02:28:47.180 --> 02:28:52.180
<v Speaker 3>It's designed to affect people's brains </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a way that can alleviate depressive </v>

3203
02:28:52.180 --> 02:28:55.451
<v Speaker 3>symptoms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But past research has shown that when a </v>

3204
02:28:55.451 --> 02:28:57.290
<v Speaker 3>person's flew ox,</v>
<v Speaker 3>team filled,</v>

3205
02:28:57.291 --> 02:29:00.620
<v Speaker 3>waste enters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>flew their shit and Piss,</v>

3206
02:29:00.800 --> 02:29:03.340
<v Speaker 3>and there's the waterways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can alter the shores,</v>

3207
02:29:03.350 --> 02:29:05.390
<v Speaker 3>crabs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>reproductive molting,</v>

3208
02:29:05.391 --> 02:29:10.391
<v Speaker 3>and digestive behaviors and may even </v>
<v Speaker 3>cause the crabs to abandon their </v>

3209
02:29:10.391 --> 02:29:11.960
<v Speaker 3>nocturnal schedule according to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>paper.</v>

3210
02:29:12.260 --> 02:29:12.740
