1
00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:04.750
<v Speaker 1>Her low freak bitches most of the time it's bad technique.</v>

2
00:00:04.751 --> 00:00:08.230
<v Speaker 1>Most of the times with the lead lag and they don't step open to right foot,</v>

3
00:00:08.231 --> 00:00:12.330
<v Speaker 1>so the angle cannot go like a 90 degree angle into the muscle and it kick</v>

4
00:00:12.331 --> 00:00:13.100
<v Speaker 1>straight up.</v>

5
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.360
<v Speaker 1>It'd be,</v>

6
00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:13.601
<v Speaker 1>she goes,</v>

7
00:00:13.601 --> 00:00:13.840
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

8
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:14.051
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

9
00:00:14.051 --> 00:00:15.400
<v Speaker 1>I've everybody who gets kicked to the pills,</v>

10
00:00:15.401 --> 00:00:19.150
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you the leg that they're standing on the toes are pointing forward.</v>

11
00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:20.560
<v Speaker 1>If they will pointed the site,</v>

12
00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:21.370
<v Speaker 1>it will be okay.</v>

13
00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:22.210
<v Speaker 1>Well with check,</v>

14
00:00:22.211 --> 00:00:24.190
<v Speaker 1>I believe it was knees and the clinch.</v>

15
00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:25.450
<v Speaker 1>Oh it was,</v>

16
00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:26.480
<v Speaker 1>I think it was just</v>

17
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:29.620
<v Speaker 1>a tight box or shooting on it.</v>

18
00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:30.980
<v Speaker 1>I never need anybody and bill,</v>

19
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:31.960
<v Speaker 1>I did once actually,</v>

20
00:00:31.961 --> 00:00:33.130
<v Speaker 1>but that was on purpose.</v>

21
00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.980
<v Speaker 1>I guess they rose.</v>

22
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.610
<v Speaker 1>I if I could fight video from that,</v>

23
00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.110
<v Speaker 1>that is the best deal.</v>

24
00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:42.320
<v Speaker 1>So I fight where they,</v>

25
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:42.641
<v Speaker 1>Rosie,</v>

26
00:00:42.641 --> 00:00:43.480
<v Speaker 1>you heard about that right?</v>

27
00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.340
<v Speaker 1>The taller guy from whole,</v>

28
00:00:44.341 --> 00:00:47.480
<v Speaker 1>a total psychopath they say and it does always illegal thing.</v>

29
00:00:47.481 --> 00:00:49.120
<v Speaker 1>So we're fighting him and I'm the first ride.</v>

30
00:00:49.121 --> 00:00:51.910
<v Speaker 1>I beat the crap out of him in a second ride would come out and be a clinching</v>

31
00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.490
<v Speaker 1>and he bites in my ear and I'm shouting,</v>

32
00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.270
<v Speaker 1>let go,</v>

33
00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:56.103
<v Speaker 1>let go,</v>

34
00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:56.801
<v Speaker 1>let go.</v>

35
00:00:56.801 --> 00:01:00.610
<v Speaker 1>And then you see my knee going all the way back and then I need him as he comes</v>

36
00:01:00.611 --> 00:01:01.421
<v Speaker 1>loose from the ground.</v>

37
00:01:01.421 --> 00:01:02.830
<v Speaker 1>That's how I knew him in the bills.</v>

38
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.830
<v Speaker 1>He goes down and I wanted to attack him on the ground,</v>

39
00:01:05.831 --> 00:01:06.641
<v Speaker 1>but they pulled me off.</v>

40
00:01:06.641 --> 00:01:07.380
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

41
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

42
00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.160
<v Speaker 1>core Hybris was in my corner.</v>

43
00:01:09.161 --> 00:01:12.790
<v Speaker 1>Now he brought all his friends was he had hell's angels with him and,</v>

44
00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.660
<v Speaker 1>and I had all my bosses friends with me and they all started fighting.</v>

45
00:01:16.661 --> 00:01:17.494
<v Speaker 1>They throw us,</v>

46
00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.150
<v Speaker 1>they threw a chair into the ring.</v>

47
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.000
<v Speaker 1>It bounced off core hammers says beck at LEDs behind me.</v>

48
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.020
<v Speaker 1>If you see the video,</v>

49
00:01:23.021 --> 00:01:23.380
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

50
00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.310
<v Speaker 1>it lags behind me.</v>

51
00:01:24.311 --> 00:01:25.300
<v Speaker 1>I looked behind me,</v>

52
00:01:25.301 --> 00:01:25.930
<v Speaker 1>I see the chair,</v>

53
00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.250
<v Speaker 1>I sit in the chair while I watch.</v>

54
00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.490
<v Speaker 1>And that later they cleared everybody.</v>

55
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.960
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's throwing down because the referee took,</v>

56
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.531
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>

57
00:01:35.531 --> 00:01:36.191
<v Speaker 1>why did you do it?</v>

58
00:01:36.191 --> 00:01:36.401
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

59
00:01:36.401 --> 00:01:37.000
<v Speaker 1>look at my ear.</v>

60
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.980
<v Speaker 1>And it was a hole straight through my air.</v>

61
00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.150
<v Speaker 1>He bitched straight through my ear,</v>

62
00:01:40.151 --> 00:01:43.280
<v Speaker 1>a in there and then he grabbed a microphone and he announced to everybody,</v>

63
00:01:43.281 --> 00:01:43.561
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

64
00:01:43.561 --> 00:01:44.320
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

65
00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.160
<v Speaker 1>he's got a hole in his ear.</v>

66
00:01:45.161 --> 00:01:45.731
<v Speaker 1>He bit his ear.</v>

67
00:01:45.731 --> 00:01:46.331
<v Speaker 1>That's why he did it.</v>

68
00:01:46.331 --> 00:01:47.380
<v Speaker 1>And then everybody calm down.</v>

69
00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.490
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

70
00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:49.870
<v Speaker 1>And did you continue to fight?</v>

71
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.621
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

72
00:01:50.621 --> 00:01:50.741
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

73
00:01:50.741 --> 00:01:50.891
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

74
00:01:50.891 --> 00:01:51.590
<v Speaker 1>That was it.</v>

75
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.300
<v Speaker 1>It was a hard knee.</v>

76
00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.570
<v Speaker 1>And the idea of where we live twice as long as our ancestors did a century ago,</v>

77
00:01:58.571 --> 00:01:58.870
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

78
00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:59.141
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

79
00:01:59.141 --> 00:01:59.651
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

80
00:01:59.651 --> 00:02:04.390
<v Speaker 1>But really no one's living above 120 just more and more people are pushing up to</v>

81
00:02:04.391 --> 00:02:08.380
<v Speaker 1>the upper ceiling because of public health and just general stuff we do that</v>

82
00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:09.250
<v Speaker 1>makes us healthier.</v>

83
00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.650
<v Speaker 1>But in terms of longevity and aging,</v>

84
00:02:11.651 --> 00:02:12.461
<v Speaker 1>you can't stop it.</v>

85
00:02:12.461 --> 00:02:15.810
<v Speaker 1>All she could do is kind of hopefully slow it down a little bit and,</v>

86
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.780
<v Speaker 1>and you want to have a higher quality of life the further up you go as opposed</v>

87
00:02:19.781 --> 00:02:23.920
<v Speaker 1>to lying in bed with tubes for the last 10 years of your life or something like</v>

88
00:02:23.921 --> 00:02:24.101
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

89
00:02:24.101 --> 00:02:24.850
<v Speaker 1>So that was,</v>

90
00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.380
<v Speaker 1>that's where the future research is.</v>

91
00:02:26.381 --> 00:02:27.550
<v Speaker 1>Where the breakthroughs will come.</v>

92
00:02:27.551 --> 00:02:28.300
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>

93
00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.270
<v Speaker 1>not radical life extension lists that I've also written about.</v>

94
00:02:31.271 --> 00:02:31.570
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

95
00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:32.860
<v Speaker 1>we're going to have 500 years,</v>

96
00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.870
<v Speaker 1>the Schermer don't you want to live 500 years?</v>

97
00:02:34.871 --> 00:02:35.704
<v Speaker 1>Like look,</v>

98
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.260
<v Speaker 1>just get me to 90 without Alzheimer's and cancer.</v>

99
00:02:38.261 --> 00:02:38.950
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

100
00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.380
<v Speaker 1>let's just start one decade at a time.</v>

101
00:02:41.381 --> 00:02:42.280
<v Speaker 1>It just easy,</v>

102
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:43.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

103
00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.030
<v Speaker 1>because you know the problems are really complex.</v>

104
00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.060
<v Speaker 1>I think the quality of life thing that you mentioned is one of the most</v>

105
00:02:49.061 --> 00:02:49.690
<v Speaker 1>important things.</v>

106
00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.530
<v Speaker 1>Like we have this phrase that I've said many times,</v>

107
00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:54.340
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to say,</v>

108
00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.420
<v Speaker 1>cause it fits right here.</v>

109
00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:56.920
<v Speaker 1>We all love to sleep,</v>

110
00:02:56.921 --> 00:02:58.240
<v Speaker 1>but everyone's afraid to die.</v>

111
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:00.730
<v Speaker 1>We love to shut off.</v>

112
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.050
<v Speaker 1>We'd love to shut off at night.</v>

113
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.300
<v Speaker 1>Everybody loves it and we look forward to it.</v>

114
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.440
<v Speaker 1>But that one big shutoff off when you're not coming back is just too fucked up.</v>

115
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:09.910
<v Speaker 1>It's just too much.</v>

116
00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:11.160
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

117
00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.993
<v Speaker 1>it's inevitable.</v>

118
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.941
<v Speaker 1>This is my,</v>

119
00:03:12.941 --> 00:03:14.620
<v Speaker 1>in my next book I have a chapter called,</v>

120
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:15.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

121
00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.540
<v Speaker 1>afterlife for atheists.</v>

122
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.150
<v Speaker 1>So these are not just the radical life extension is,</v>

123
00:03:19.151 --> 00:03:20.650
<v Speaker 1>but the p the mine loaders.</v>

124
00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.241
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

125
00:03:22.241 --> 00:03:22.451
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

126
00:03:22.451 --> 00:03:24.190
<v Speaker 1>you're going to scan your connectome,</v>

127
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.270
<v Speaker 1>put it in a computer,</v>

128
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:26.141
<v Speaker 1>and then you know,</v>

129
00:03:26.141 --> 00:03:29.000
<v Speaker 1>you'll wake up in the computer like Johnny Depp in that sentence mood.</v>

130
00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:30.243
<v Speaker 1>Here's the problem.</v>

131
00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:31.550
<v Speaker 1>When you go to sleep,</v>

132
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.470
<v Speaker 1>then you wake up tomorrow,</v>

133
00:03:32.471 --> 00:03:33.940
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're groggy for a few minutes,</v>

134
00:03:33.941 --> 00:03:35.240
<v Speaker 1>but you're,</v>

135
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:35.570
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

136
00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:36.310
<v Speaker 1>you're back.</v>

137
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.340
<v Speaker 1>You still feel like you,</v>

138
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.920
<v Speaker 1>there's a continuity between today and tomorrow or you get general anesthesia</v>

139
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:42.640
<v Speaker 1>surgery.</v>

140
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.130
<v Speaker 1>You wake up groggy or for a little bit longer,</v>

141
00:03:45.131 --> 00:03:46.660
<v Speaker 1>but the continuity comes back.</v>

142
00:03:46.661 --> 00:03:47.494
<v Speaker 1>It's still you.</v>

143
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.001
<v Speaker 1>So the question is,</v>

144
00:03:49.001 --> 00:03:49.930
<v Speaker 1>is if you're,</v>

145
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.320
<v Speaker 1>you die and we have a scan of your connectome and we put it in a computer and</v>

146
00:03:55.451 --> 00:03:56.284
<v Speaker 1>turn it on,</v>

147
00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.890
<v Speaker 1>are you going to wake up in the computer like you did from sleep?</v>

148
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.090
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think so.</v>

149
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.400
<v Speaker 1>I think it would just be a copy of your,</v>

150
00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:04.840
<v Speaker 1>if this could ever be done,</v>

151
00:04:04.841 --> 00:04:07.120
<v Speaker 1>which is very unlikely because it's super hard problem.</v>

152
00:04:07.121 --> 00:04:08.560
<v Speaker 1>But let's just say it could.</v>

153
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:09.813
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

154
00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:10.750
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

155
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.720
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a break in continuity from death.</v>

156
00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:14.561
<v Speaker 1>You're dead.</v>

157
00:04:14.561 --> 00:04:15.160
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

158
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.350
<v Speaker 1>And this thing we have is a copy of you.</v>

159
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.470
<v Speaker 1>It would be like if we cloned your body and then you die and then we reconstruct</v>

160
00:04:22.511 --> 00:04:23.680
<v Speaker 1>the body and there you are.</v>

161
00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.060
<v Speaker 1>That's not you.</v>

162
00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.980
<v Speaker 1>Not first person through the eyes.</v>

163
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.330
<v Speaker 1>Me,</v>

164
00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.530
<v Speaker 1>it's just a copy of me.</v>

165
00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.270
<v Speaker 2>I've always had this rose colored view of us and I acknowledged that it's a</v>

166
00:04:34.271 --> 00:04:34.870
<v Speaker 2>myth,</v>

167
00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.270
<v Speaker 2>but I always look at the myth of America as I call it,</v>

168
00:04:37.271 --> 00:04:39.700
<v Speaker 2>the 1950s high school textbook view of America.</v>

169
00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.220
<v Speaker 2>That to me is what I want to move towards.</v>

170
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.400
<v Speaker 2>So when they talk about creating a more perfect union,</v>

171
00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.170
<v Speaker 2>that to me is the goal and anything that conflicts with that self image to me is</v>

172
00:04:50.171 --> 00:04:50.950
<v Speaker 2>the problem.</v>

173
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:54.520
<v Speaker 2>So when you see sometimes how we really operate anything Dick Cheney does,</v>

174
00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:56.290
<v Speaker 2>and I don't use the word evil,</v>

175
00:04:56.291 --> 00:04:59.650
<v Speaker 2>so I'll use the word nefarious Dick Cheney is to me,</v>

176
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.101
<v Speaker 2>when you say,</v>

177
00:05:00.101 --> 00:05:01.450
<v Speaker 2>what do you want to avoid in this country?</v>

178
00:05:01.451 --> 00:05:05.230
<v Speaker 2>I want to avoid where Dick Cheney wants us to go because nothing conflicts with</v>

179
00:05:05.231 --> 00:05:10.231
<v Speaker 2>my 1950s mythological American textbook idea than what Cheney wants us to be.</v>

180
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.030
<v Speaker 2>And when you look at some of the things we'd done,</v>

181
00:05:13.031 --> 00:05:16.450
<v Speaker 2>some of the things based on that 1947 1948 America,</v>

182
00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.300
<v Speaker 2>which we thought could we have to do everything to stop global communism?</v>

183
00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:20.380
<v Speaker 2>They're going to take over the country.</v>

184
00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.410
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you look at some of the things we did and you realize some of what</v>

185
00:05:23.411 --> 00:05:25.030
<v Speaker 2>we're dealing with today is blow back.</v>

186
00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.220
<v Speaker 2>You don't know how to undo that.</v>

187
00:05:27.221 --> 00:05:27.431
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

188
00:05:27.431 --> 00:05:29.000
<v Speaker 2>you almost think it's like permanent damage.</v>

189
00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:30.730
<v Speaker 2>Look at the way some in the Middle East see us.</v>

190
00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:31.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

191
00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:31.760
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

192
00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:32.001
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>

193
00:05:32.001 --> 00:05:33.010
<v Speaker 2>I'll talk to people like,</v>

194
00:05:33.011 --> 00:05:36.160
<v Speaker 2>I remember talking to Sam Harris about this and he was talking about what you</v>

195
00:05:36.161 --> 00:05:37.420
<v Speaker 2>have to see things this certain way.</v>

196
00:05:37.421 --> 00:05:37.901
<v Speaker 2>And I said yes,</v>

197
00:05:37.901 --> 00:05:39.520
<v Speaker 2>but that's not going to help you solve the problem.</v>

198
00:05:39.521 --> 00:05:42.130
<v Speaker 2>How do you solve the problem if we've already,</v>

199
00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:46.180
<v Speaker 2>if we've already soiled our beds so much that you don't know how to fix that,</v>

200
00:05:46.181 --> 00:05:46.841
<v Speaker 2>you don't know how to go and say,</v>

201
00:05:46.841 --> 00:05:47.081
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

202
00:05:47.081 --> 00:05:47.771
<v Speaker 2>we're sorry about this.</v>

203
00:05:47.771 --> 00:05:48.850
<v Speaker 2>Can we start from scratch?</v>

204
00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.490
<v Speaker 2>You can't do that in foreign affairs.</v>

205
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.510
<v Speaker 2>Just like you can't do it with the mainframe computer.</v>

206
00:05:52.511 --> 00:05:53.321
<v Speaker 2>That is the government,</v>

207
00:05:53.321 --> 00:05:53.860
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

208
00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:54.910
<v Speaker 2>I can't figure out how to,</v>

209
00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.790
<v Speaker 2>how to reverse course to a point where we can once again fix stuff.</v>

210
00:05:58.791 --> 00:05:59.001
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

211
00:05:59.001 --> 00:05:59.240
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

212
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.440
<v Speaker 2>it's too damaged.</v>

213
00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:03.470
<v Speaker 2>I think it just has to dry out slowly but surely.</v>

214
00:06:03.471 --> 00:06:03.681
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

215
00:06:03.681 --> 00:06:07.880
<v Speaker 2>all the wounds of the past have to heal up and dry out and it just takes time.</v>

216
00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.270
<v Speaker 2>Deal generation.</v>

217
00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:09.980
<v Speaker 2>Do you mean rate?</v>

218
00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:12.500
<v Speaker 2>We've already made enough people mad at us so that thereafter us,</v>

219
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:15.320
<v Speaker 2>well now we have to go protect ourselves by going and getting them.</v>

220
00:06:15.321 --> 00:06:16.820
<v Speaker 2>So we perpetuate the cycle.</v>

221
00:06:16.821 --> 00:06:19.490
<v Speaker 2>Like I can't figure out how to jump off the merry go round.</v>

222
00:06:19.491 --> 00:06:20.240
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what I mean?</v>

223
00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it moves that way.</v>

224
00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:25.340
<v Speaker 2>I think we're trying to make a battleship move like a race car and I just think</v>

225
00:06:25.341 --> 00:06:30.341
<v Speaker 2>it takes a long time to shift course and when we're looking at these people that</v>

226
00:06:30.711 --> 00:06:34.430
<v Speaker 2>are in the Middle East that are opposing the u s right now and angry and want</v>

227
00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:35.540
<v Speaker 2>attack the US right now,</v>

228
00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.850
<v Speaker 2>you're most likely never going to get to them.</v>

229
00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.800
<v Speaker 2>You might get to their grandchildren.</v>

230
00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:42.350
<v Speaker 2>And I think that might be the only way.</v>

231
00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:44.780
<v Speaker 2>Things slowly but surely settled down.</v>

232
00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.950
<v Speaker 2>And that's the argument for the NSA and the CIA to continue to monitor things</v>

233
00:06:48.951 --> 00:06:52.820
<v Speaker 2>that are really kind of ridiculous and invasive level because there's so many</v>

234
00:06:52.821 --> 00:06:55.730
<v Speaker 2>people out there that hate us or hate the government,</v>

235
00:06:55.731 --> 00:06:57.720
<v Speaker 2>hate the military and hate what's happened to them.</v>

236
00:06:57.721 --> 00:07:01.190
<v Speaker 2>And so many martyrs are created every time a drone strike was going to go,</v>

237
00:07:01.191 --> 00:07:01.640
<v Speaker 2>how do you,</v>

238
00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:02.210
<v Speaker 2>how do you,</v>

239
00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:05.630
<v Speaker 2>how do you get that next generation to not hate us when we're busy killing their</v>

240
00:07:05.631 --> 00:07:07.310
<v Speaker 2>parents because their parents want to kill us?</v>

241
00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:10.910
<v Speaker 2>That's the cycle and I can't figure out how to break the cycle.</v>

242
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:14.570
<v Speaker 2>How do you protect ourselves from their anti American parents in a way that</v>

243
00:07:14.571 --> 00:07:16.310
<v Speaker 2>doesn't turn them against us too?</v>

244
00:07:16.311 --> 00:07:17.144
<v Speaker 2>Does that make sense?</v>

245
00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:25.950
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
