1
00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:07.330
Good.
We never know how to start these things.
This is never like,

2
00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.470
never feels like it has thing podcasts like a conversation.

3
00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:13.900
It has to get a ball rolling.
It's not like a song.

4
00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.830
They get kick off with a good jam.
I need,
uh,
we need momentum.

5
00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.340
This episode of the Joe Rogan experience podcast brought to you by

6
00:00:21.341 --> 00:00:26.200
squarespace.com.
squarespace.com is a,
it's a website that we highly recommend.

7
00:00:26.201 --> 00:00:27.250
If you want to make a website,

8
00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.980
you don't have to go to someone and get your website made anymore.

9
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.260
You used to be dead.
I've,

10
00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.970
I've had every single one of my websites made by someone who knows what the fuck

11
00:00:33.971 --> 00:00:35.770
they're doing,
but you don't have to do that.

12
00:00:35.771 --> 00:00:38.620
Now I've actually messed around with this and created a website and cc to do.

13
00:00:38.621 --> 00:00:43.570
Brian is created a shit load of them.
Why?
We've done the actual show itself.

14
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.070
It shows you how to do everything and you don't even have to enter your credit

15
00:00:48.071 --> 00:00:52.510
card to try it.
If you're like,
Ooh,
this ain't going to work,
just give it a shot.

16
00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.480
Fuck around with it online.
And if you're not into it,
just close the browser.

17
00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:56.620
But if you're into it,

18
00:00:56.621 --> 00:01:00.550
you enter in your credit card information and you can just take it live and you

19
00:01:00.551 --> 00:01:04.900
can also start your own store.
Online stores are stupid,
easy to do.

20
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.950
And the way it's set up,
it's basically point and click.

21
00:01:08.951 --> 00:01:11.500
If you know how to use normal normal programs,

22
00:01:11.501 --> 00:01:13.210
like if you can open Microsoft word,

23
00:01:13.211 --> 00:01:15.880
if you can go to a website and navigate your way around,

24
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.570
you can figure out how to use Squarespace.
It's stupid,
easy,

25
00:01:19.571 --> 00:01:23.740
choose from over 20 bad ass designs.
They have 24 hours,
24,

26
00:01:23.741 --> 00:01:28.390
seven super fast email support and live online chat support.

27
00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:29.450
It also works with everything.

28
00:01:29.451 --> 00:01:32.440
And if you make a website or work on an iPhone and a work on Android,

29
00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.890
it work on all the different browsers on computers to go to squarespace.com and

30
00:01:38.381 --> 00:01:43.120
if you use the code word Joe and the number nine,
all one word,
Joe Nine,

31
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.960
uh,
you will save 20% for a limited time.

32
00:01:46.961 --> 00:01:48.340
I think that's just till the end of this month,

33
00:01:48.341 --> 00:01:51.430
which is like tomorrow or something.
Right?
So,
uh,

34
00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.380
if you hear this today is September 30th,
no,
this,
that,
that,
that,

35
00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.280
that probably only works for a couple days after that.
Yeah,
maybe,
well,

36
00:02:00.281 --> 00:02:01.900
hopefully they'll,
but it will be that,

37
00:02:01.901 --> 00:02:05.800
but I don't know if they get the 20% off because it's normally a 10% off.

38
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.750
They doubled it up anyway.
That's it.
Go there.
Do that if you want or don't,

39
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.800
it doesn't matter.
It's all going to be good.
We're also brought to you by it.

40
00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.640
That's it.
That's the beautiful thing about high numbers.
You know what?

41
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.890
There's no,
no high pressure in your folks.
There's plenty of us out there.

42
00:02:17.891 --> 00:02:20.650
Some of us actually need to make a website.
Um,

43
00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.530
but here's something we could all use because let's be honest,

44
00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.300
most of us are dumb as fuck.

45
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.080
And there's a website that tries to help you with that.
It's called Lumosity.

46
00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.290
And the idea behind Lumosity is the same idea behind exercise is use your mind

47
00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.480
and use your mind in very specific ways.
If you just exercise like a knucklehead,

48
00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.190
you don't know what you're doing.
You're not going to get any results.

49
00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.230
The best way to get results at an exercise is to engage in a program that's

50
00:02:47.231 --> 00:02:49.750
specifically designed to make your body work better.

51
00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.540
And that's what they've done with the human brain.

52
00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.530
They've created a bunch of games and these games are so specific that you

53
00:02:56.531 --> 00:03:01.180
actually can enter in different parameters.
You get started and they ask you,

54
00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:05.770
okay,
like what,
what are your memory?
Are you trying to improve?

55
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.160
Whether you were trying to recall certain,
uh,
certain names,

56
00:03:09.161 --> 00:03:11.410
whether you're trying to learn new things,

57
00:03:11.411 --> 00:03:13.960
whether you're trying to keep track of several ideas at the same time.

58
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.410
So he entering which one of those things applies and then the next step

59
00:03:17.411 --> 00:03:21.820
attention and you can,
it says improved productivity concentrate.

60
00:03:21.821 --> 00:03:24.370
And based on what are these things you check,

61
00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:26.800
like maybe you don't give a fuck about maintaining focus.

62
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.140
Maybe you're just one of those dudes as gangster about that.

63
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.380
Or maybe you don't give a fuck about a reacting quickly.

64
00:03:32.381 --> 00:03:36.220
You're just a laid back guy.
If you do though,
they have it set up for speeds,

65
00:03:36.221 --> 00:03:39.010
speed of the mind,
speed of decision making.

66
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.610
And it all comes out in games.

67
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.500
And what they've done is essentially set up a bunch of fun games that you can

68
00:03:47.501 --> 00:03:51.340
play.
And these games actually increase your memory,

69
00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.230
make your focus,
your,
your,
your,
your mental speed better.

70
00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.730
Make your,
your focus more in tune,
better problem solving.

71
00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.360
It's really kind of interesting.
I just started fucking around with it and,
uh,

72
00:04:04.361 --> 00:04:07.800
I feel exactly the same.
I'm not going to lie to you,
but it's,
it's early.

73
00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.080
I mean I'm a thickheaded dude.
It's going to take some time to,

74
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:16.150
to make me smarter.
But uh,
but I'm into it and it's interesting and a,

75
00:04:16.151 --> 00:04:20.920
if you go there say that you heard it from me,
Joe Rogan and uh,

76
00:04:20.921 --> 00:04:23.930
I don't know what happens.
They hook you up or something.
Maybe they,

77
00:04:23.931 --> 00:04:28.300
they say thanks man.
And one for women.
I don't think so.
I do not think so.

78
00:04:28.301 --> 00:04:32.110
I think it's entirely,
but,
which is probably a good idea,
right?

79
00:04:32.111 --> 00:04:36.520
Cause men and women's minds have been proven scientifically to function better.

80
00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.230
Uh,
and who would know better than you?
Both sides of the coin.

81
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.610
You can tell us exactly what the fuck's going on.
Um,
so go there.
Go to Lumosity,

82
00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:49.120
check it out and tell them that Joe Rogan sent you and you'll enjoy it.
It's a,

83
00:04:49.121 --> 00:04:51.730
it's interesting I'm using it like I told you guys that I would,
uh,

84
00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.250
update you along the way.
And uh,
like I said,

85
00:04:54.251 --> 00:04:56.560
I'm not any smarter in exactly the same,
at least I don't think.

86
00:04:56.561 --> 00:04:59.920
I think it would take time.
Maybe I am.
Maybe you think I am.

87
00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.440
Maybe you're going bro.
Joe,
you're being hard on yourself.

88
00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.770
You feel smarter already this show.
If so,
thank you.
All right.

89
00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.050
We're also brought to you by [inaudible] dot com that's o,
n n,
I t.

90
00:05:09.051 --> 00:05:11.830
And this will be the last commercial.
I feel like,
what the fuck dude,

91
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:17.180
you just some sort of a capitalist just trying to get paid son.
Uh,

92
00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:20.200
go on at.com and check out all of the things we have to offer.

93
00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:25.120
The way we best describe on it is,
is a human optimization website.

94
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.060
We try to make available for you.

95
00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.620
Everything that we enjoy me by me and we uh,

96
00:05:32.621 --> 00:05:36.850
I mean Aubrey,
um,
and myself and all the folks that uh,

97
00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:41.560
that own on it,
the way we have it set up is anything we find that's good.

98
00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.140
Whether it's the best,
um,

99
00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:47.220
hemp protein powder we can find whether it's the,

100
00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:52.320
the best Himalayan salt or killer bee honey or MCT oil use,

101
00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:55.690
like we sell the bulletproof stuff because we're,
I think his stuff is the best.

102
00:05:55.691 --> 00:05:58.880
I think he has the best coffee and I think he has the best MCT oil.

103
00:05:58.881 --> 00:06:03.320
I've listened to his philosophy on acquiring products and I,
I believe in it.

104
00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.240
So we just sell his shit.
You know,

105
00:06:05.241 --> 00:06:09.020
we try to find the best stuff that we can get online as far as strength and

106
00:06:09.021 --> 00:06:11.780
conditioning equipment.
Well there it's battle ropes.
We end,

107
00:06:11.781 --> 00:06:13.880
we tried to sell them to as reasonably as possible.

108
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:17.810
We're not trying to rip anybody off and improving of that.

109
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:22.730
All the supplements on,
on at.com,
like a shroom tack and Alpha Brain.

110
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:27.710
They all have a 30 pill,
90 day money back guarantee,

111
00:06:27.711 --> 00:06:30.110
which means if you try out for brain and you go,

112
00:06:30.111 --> 00:06:33.110
you don't want it to sit and you didn't do shit for me,
you get your money back.

113
00:06:33.111 --> 00:06:34.880
You don't even have to send the pills back in.

114
00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.420
Like the idea behind it is to make sure that nobody feels ripped off.

115
00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:42.720
The last thing I want is anybody feeling like they get fucked unless you wanted

116
00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.570
to get fucked.
You know what I'm saying?

117
00:06:44.571 --> 00:06:49.070
People go to [inaudible] dot com use the code named Brogan and save 10% off any

118
00:06:49.071 --> 00:06:51.400
and all supplements.
We've got a lot of cool shit,
including the,

119
00:06:51.401 --> 00:06:56.000
the new primal bells,
which are all kettle bells.
Um,
by uh,

120
00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:59.510
John Shubin Juniors.
That's the same,
right?
I said,
God damn,

121
00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:01.100
I'm terrible with these fucking things.

122
00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:06.600
I want to say somewhat Mr Shubin Mr Shoe,
but I presume,
yeah,

123
00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:10.280
they're pretty bad ass.
Well,
they're made by a,
um,
a real artist.

124
00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:14.810
Stephen's Shubin,
Steven Shubin.
I want to say it's Steven.
Wow.
Fuck.

125
00:07:14.811 --> 00:07:19.220
I keep forgetting I'm terrible at names.
Um,
yeah,
the gorillas,
two pood,

126
00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:24.280
which is a Russian measurement of weight for Kettlebells at 72 pounds and the

127
00:07:25.401 --> 00:07:29.570
orangutans 54 and the chimp is 35.
These are all balanced out too,

128
00:07:29.571 --> 00:07:32.750
so you can use them.
They're actually functional,
not just cool looking.

129
00:07:32.751 --> 00:07:35.330
They should put one with your head on it.
Maybe.

130
00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:37.910
Maybe I could be like 60 pounds,

131
00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:42.950
but people don't want to commit to the gorilla.
But uh,

132
00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:46.270
they have big fat handles are,
they're uh,
they enhance your grip strength.
We,

133
00:07:46.271 --> 00:07:49.790
we made them as good as we can for actual use.
I use that chimp all the time.

134
00:07:49.791 --> 00:07:54.320
And I,
I,
I use a gorilla to,
for a power movements.
Power movements.

135
00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:58.700
All Right,
ladies and gentlemen,
that's it.
The end on a.com codeword Rogan,

136
00:07:58.701 --> 00:08:03.470
ballade fucking blah,
blah,
blah.
This weekend I'm at the Ontario Improv.

137
00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:05.810
That's an Ontario,
California.

138
00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.360
Don't be freaking out if you're living in an Ontario,
Canada,

139
00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:12.650
cause I was just as air.
We were just at in Toronto,
you're Fox,
but a,

140
00:08:12.651 --> 00:08:15.200
that's this weekend I'll be at the Ontario Improv.

141
00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:19.530
Then October 18th I'm at the buy you music center in Houston,
Texas.
Uh,

142
00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:21.680
it's almost sold out.
There's only a,

143
00:08:21.681 --> 00:08:23.570
I think there's like a hundred tickets left or less.

144
00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:27.920
And then a dance house theater and Manchester,

145
00:08:27.921 --> 00:08:30.470
England on the 25th that shit sold out.

146
00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:34.580
And then Irvine Improv on November 1st,

147
00:08:34.581 --> 00:08:39.160
second and third.
That's an Irvine,
California.
All right.
That's it.
That's,

148
00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:43.340
that's all we got going on.
Fuck angels here.
We're going to,
we're going to party.

149
00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:44.211
Excuse me.

150
00:08:44.211 --> 00:08:49.211
Music Chamie Bogan experience.

151
00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:54.040
<v 2>Try my day.
I'll get podcasts all day.</v>

152
00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:56.490
You were saying that's serious

153
00:08:57.210 --> 00:09:01.230
<v 1>stuff you have to talk about,
like your sponsorship is serious.
I mean,</v>

154
00:09:01.231 --> 00:09:04.350
you know what I mean?
That you have so much sponsorship.
It's awesome.
Yeah.

155
00:09:04.351 --> 00:09:06.420
There's a lot of sponsorship.
Too much probably.

156
00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:09.570
We're probably whoring it out right now.
Probably hitting the whore threshold.

157
00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:14.640
Well,
it helps.
It helps to get,
it motivates you to do things too,

158
00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:16.770
but it's all good stuff for it.
Yeah,
it's all good stuff.

159
00:09:16.771 --> 00:09:20.670
We make sure that I've definitely turned down more things than I'm accepted,
uh,

160
00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:25.440
for podcast sponsors because it's a lot of them just no sketchy or,

161
00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:30.180
well,
you believe phonics.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Everything that we have,

162
00:09:30.181 --> 00:09:33.300
I use and that's the point.
Yeah.
Or if I wouldn't use,

163
00:09:33.301 --> 00:09:37.770
I believe that I would use it if I had a situation like stamps.com I don't use

164
00:09:37.771 --> 00:09:41.990
it,
but if it came up,
I'd use it.
Or the website builder.
Exactly.

165
00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:46.050
Exactly.
I'm saying,
well,
hey man,
thanks for doing this.
I really appreciate it.

166
00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:48.330
I appreciate you coming by.
It's really cool it for you to have me on.

167
00:09:48.331 --> 00:09:52.440
You know that is it.
You know how cool.
It is a huge,
I try not to,

168
00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:58.170
I try not to be aware about.
Cool.
Anything goes.
You just stay as a,

169
00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:02.940
even as mellow as possible.
Some people are very scared,
so they won't go there.

170
00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:04.400
Oh Man.
Do you know what?

171
00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:07.140
I think people are more scared of themselves and they are of other things,

172
00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:11.010
especially on a minute.
Yeah.
Well,
there's a lot of that going on,
right?

173
00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:15.000
That's a weird thing with humans.
We're all,
first of all,

174
00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:18.270
we're all afraid of the great beyond.
We're afraid of the abyss.

175
00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:20.430
At the end of this journey,
which we were all face,

176
00:10:20.431 --> 00:10:24.240
everybody's fucking terrified of that.
And,
and,
and,
and being terrified of that,

177
00:10:24.241 --> 00:10:26.970
you also open yourself up to a series of other terrorists.

178
00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:30.660
The accept because you have the primary terror that's always tick talking and

179
00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:32.520
you don't want to think about that primary terror.

180
00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:36.300
So you ignore that primary terror with a series of other terrorists,

181
00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:41.600
whether it's you're worried about homos or immigrants or blacks or Mexicans or

182
00:10:43.021 --> 00:10:46.410
Canadians or Russians,
it's always them.

183
00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:51.210
It's always somebody who wants to take my guns or someone who has guns.
You know,

184
00:10:51.211 --> 00:10:51.640
it's this,

185
00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:56.640
it's either someone who's moving into the neighborhood or there's always people

186
00:10:57.511 --> 00:10:59.010
wallet.
I mean there's,

187
00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:03.390
there's also the problem of there's too much information coming on a daily
basis,

188
00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:04.021
right?
You know,

189
00:11:04.021 --> 00:11:07.500
there's fucking 7 billion people on this planet and we're just inundated with

190
00:11:07.501 --> 00:11:11.490
horror stories like all throughout the globe constantly.
Every day,

191
00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:15.300
the grossest shit is a shift that we're going to pay attention to the most,

192
00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:19.350
the most horrifying stories in the news,
the ones that we're going to,

193
00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:22.830
they're going to get the most clicks.
So,
you know,
the old adage,

194
00:11:22.831 --> 00:11:26.580
if it bleeds it leads,
but I think people are interested in that.

195
00:11:26.581 --> 00:11:27.750
That's why they do that.

196
00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:32.040
Because people get excited to hear that crazy bad news or else it wouldn't be

197
00:11:32.041 --> 00:11:36.240
the number one news.
Well,
I think it's because it's a part of,
um,
our,
our past,

198
00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:38.510
you know,
and it's also like what got us to,

199
00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:43.520
to be in 2013 the first place is by being scared of everything and staying

200
00:11:43.711 --> 00:11:47.430
alive.
You know,
breeding,
keeping,
moving,
staying alive,

201
00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:49.230
being terrified of anything that can hurt you.

202
00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:52.860
But these things can really hurt us.
They could hurt us if we're there,

203
00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:54.130
but we're not there.
We're not,

204
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:56.920
<v 3>we're not right next to the volcano as it goes off on the other side of the</v>

205
00:11:56.921 --> 00:11:59.050
planet.
Yeah.
But they're touching on that fear.

206
00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:02.320
And then that fear comes up with whatever you just said.

207
00:12:02.321 --> 00:12:05.920
Any of those above mentioned things.
And then all of a sudden you're like,
ah,

208
00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:09.160
yeah,
right.
I mean I kind of did that when I moved out of the United States.

209
00:12:09.161 --> 00:12:11.370
I'll be honest with you.
I would imagine so kind of,

210
00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:13.090
it was going to ask you if we could talk about that,

211
00:12:13.091 --> 00:12:16.810
cause I didn't know if you wanted to,
I'll,
oh totally.
You live in,
in Mexico now?

212
00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:20.410
I live in the Yucatan in Mexico.
That's pretty dope.
What happened?
Well,

213
00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:22.960
I mean I was living in New Orleans and Hurricane Katrina hit.

214
00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:28.000
I remember and I was really disappointed with the way that things were going and

215
00:12:28.001 --> 00:12:32.340
I really just saw like,
well I live in this country,
don't get me wrong.
I,

216
00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:35.800
I'm an American.
I'm totally cool with that.
I like being an American,

217
00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:39.550
but I was really having a hard time with the government and just everything that

218
00:12:39.551 --> 00:12:41.650
was happening that really kind of set me off.
And I was like,

219
00:12:41.651 --> 00:12:43.300
what is going on in this country?

220
00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:48.550
And I just started looking for other places to live because I just saw a future

221
00:12:48.551 --> 00:12:50.260
that was not going to be positive for me.

222
00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.890
And what did you see those positive about Mexico?
Well,
the Yucatan,

223
00:12:53.891 --> 00:12:57.670
what I felt was that I could go live there and nobody really,

224
00:12:57.671 --> 00:13:01.180
I felt first off my work and the adult entertainment business was being attacked

225
00:13:01.181 --> 00:13:05.470
by the Bush administration.
Not a lot of people really know that situation.

226
00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:10.140
Did you freak out when like Max Hardcore got arrested?
The jail.
That was,

227
00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:13.630
that was scary to me.
And I'm not a pornographer.
Yeah,
exactly.

228
00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:16.450
Thank you for saying that because even though you're not a pornographer,

229
00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:20.440
that's still something that could affect you in the long run.
Well,
not only that,

230
00:13:20.441 --> 00:13:23.770
it's like,
I don't like what he does.
I don't like,

231
00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:28.630
I've seen some of the videos of shirts mean nasty,
cruel,

232
00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:31.230
weird,
tortured type Shit I've seen.

233
00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:34.450
He opened up this girl's ass and Piston and it's Tuck a strong,

234
00:13:34.451 --> 00:13:39.070
it made her drink out of,
it's like,
it was so,
it's so gone.

235
00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:41.380
I don't like it,
you know?
I mean,

236
00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:44.860
I think it's creepy and the guy's a creep for doing it,
but whatever.

237
00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:49.240
But there's a here,
you have to understand them as a businessman.
Right.
And so,
um,

238
00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:53.140
he's like feeding the customer.
I agree.

239
00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:56.590
I agree with you in the fact that it's not my thing,
but I'm not going to judge.

240
00:13:56.650 --> 00:13:59.320
Right.
I don't like to judge,
so I don't like to judge either,
man.

241
00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:02.200
It's like I was having this conversation with a friend of mine about,
um,

242
00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:07.360
about bondage and like women who would like to get tied up and I'm like,

243
00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:10.270
look,
you can't deny that people like that.

244
00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:13.230
Like if you're a strong woman and you are,
you,

245
00:14:13.231 --> 00:14:16.450
you're kind of a control freak and you run a business and you can imagine

246
00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:18.730
anybody ever fucking tying you up.
That's okay.

247
00:14:18.731 --> 00:14:22.150
But that's just you totally like there's somebody out there that loves it.

248
00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:24.190
There's people that love it,
live for it.

249
00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:28.150
They take pictures on Twitter of their rope marks on the real live for it.
Yeah,

250
00:14:28.151 --> 00:14:31.180
they love it can tied up.
They like getting abused.

251
00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:34.130
There's people that actually enjoy it and you know,

252
00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:38.050
I guess maybe it's a fantasy thing for some of them it's consensual.

253
00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:40.880
That's the key that people need to understand is the,

254
00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:43.570
it's consenting between two adults.

255
00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:48.760
So when you get to that weird area where someone is sort of like deciding what's

256
00:14:48.761 --> 00:14:50.800
moral and immoral,
it's so

257
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:55.490
<v 4>clearly at it is,
I mean it's,
I have played those kinds of games.</v>

258
00:14:55.491 --> 00:14:59.930
I'm very into that,
this leather scene in playing certain kinds of games,

259
00:14:59.931 --> 00:15:02.990
but you have to understand it's me and that other adults saying,

260
00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:06.290
this is what we want.
Most of the time it's a negotiated,
right.

261
00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:09.770
I would never do something that you didn't want me to do to you or vice versa.

262
00:15:09.771 --> 00:15:14.300
Right.
It seems twisted,
but it's twisted in our own kind of fun way.

263
00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:16.890
Yeah,
and what the fuck is wrong with that?
What's,

264
00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:21.020
that's a weird thing to decide that there's something wrong with two people

265
00:15:21.021 --> 00:15:24.170
doing what they want to do.
That doesn't even involve you.
Thanks for saying that,

266
00:15:24.171 --> 00:15:28.520
but it's weird that that there's a certain group of people that will just openly

267
00:15:28.521 --> 00:15:32.090
do that,
that will openly try to stop people,

268
00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:35.990
stop people from marrying each other just because it has a lot to do with

269
00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:39.470
religion in this country.
It's sort of organized religion,
I need to say.

270
00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:43.340
It certainly does.
And what does that embrace that embraces the fear,

271
00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:48.080
the great answer of the fear,
the fear of the great end of the abyss.

272
00:15:48.081 --> 00:15:50.240
And if you don't do it,
we're going to do where it would tell you to do.

273
00:15:50.241 --> 00:15:54.170
Rather you're going to burn.
And internal inferno.
I'm already there.

274
00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:59.330
And internal inferno.
Internal Inferno.
Um,
are you though?

275
00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:02.990
No,
I'm just kidding.
It's impossible now actually.
I think they're there.

276
00:16:02.991 --> 00:16:06.620
They're there while they promoted.
That's the real strange thing to do to people.

277
00:16:06.621 --> 00:16:10.040
I really think that fear and that like if you don't listen to what we have to
do,

278
00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:15.290
but the fact that so many millions of people get sucked into it.
What's that?

279
00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:16.570
I have theories.
Okay.

280
00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:21.640
Oh my big one is that religion is a sin and language itself is essentially like

281
00:16:21.981 --> 00:16:26.981
a pit stop on the way to the unification of the human minds and that we still

282
00:16:28.071 --> 00:16:29.870
can lie and that's a real issue.

283
00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:35.080
And we also understand what what is convincing and we understand like when words

284
00:16:35.451 --> 00:16:36.410
come across well,

285
00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:41.360
so because you can tell me a true story and it can move me and you can get a

286
00:16:41.361 --> 00:16:43.130
very powerful reaction out of me.

287
00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:47.660
You can fabricate a story and say it as if it was true and get that exact same

288
00:16:47.661 --> 00:16:51.110
reaction because we can't read minds yet.
So because of this,

289
00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:56.410
this weird sort of adolescent stage did we have right now that were existing

290
00:16:56.540 --> 00:17:00.230
where we're,
we're not quite evolved enough.
We could read each other's minds,

291
00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:04.760
but we share a form of telepathy communication with our non verbal telepathy.

292
00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:07.100
It's basically,
if we're honest,

293
00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:11.570
you're explaining to me and I'm kind of getting a sense through the words and

294
00:17:11.571 --> 00:17:14.210
the definitions that I've got in my head of those words.

295
00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:16.160
I'm kind of getting a sense of what you're saying.

296
00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:18.950
Some reading and you can tell me stories about your past.

297
00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:21.800
You can express to me how you feel about things currently.

298
00:17:21.801 --> 00:17:24.530
I can see it from your point of view,
as long as you're being honest.

299
00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:29.540
But when you start all of a sudden realizing that you don't have to be honest,

300
00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:32.550
and then realizing that you can kind of manipulate things.
And what,

301
00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:34.490
what is the quintessential preacher?

302
00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:39.230
It's a fire and brimstone man who speaks like no one,
you know,

303
00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:42.380
someone who speaks from the word of God and stands on that stage and nose look

304
00:17:42.381 --> 00:17:46.640
to when they die and the spirit of the Lord moves me and they talk like a way

305
00:17:46.641 --> 00:17:51.330
that you never talked and it's so in and powerful that it just,

306
00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:54.690
it's just a power thing.
It just becomes a power thing.
It becomes a,

307
00:17:54.691 --> 00:17:58.110
the ability to manipulate and to move people with these lies.

308
00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:02.030
And so you just kind of person.
Yeah,
because I don't get manipulated by it.

309
00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:05.430
Neither do you.
Right.
But I could have,
I did when I was young,

310
00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:07.410
when I was really young.
I mean I was,

311
00:18:07.411 --> 00:18:10.230
I went to Catholic school when I was in first grade and that's what cured me of

312
00:18:10.231 --> 00:18:10.900
it.

313
00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:15.900
I had an evil Catholic school nun and the school was just so dark and just a

314
00:18:16.801 --> 00:18:20.760
void of happiness.
There's a,
there was no hat.
It was empty.

315
00:18:20.761 --> 00:18:25.650
It was just a depressing,
I mean it made me worry about the future of life.

316
00:18:25.651 --> 00:18:28.500
Like before I went to that school,
I was like a happy kid.

317
00:18:28.501 --> 00:18:30.090
I thought that life was going to be fun.

318
00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:35.390
And just one year with that cunt and all the other evil fucks that we're running

319
00:18:35.881 --> 00:18:38.730
that school and just seen kids get.

320
00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:43.890
Peyton was six and you first felt that at six years old.

321
00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:45.350
I remember that very clearly.

322
00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:48.960
Very clearly that religion was horse shit right away.
I was like,
oh,

323
00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:52.470
this is all bullshit.
Like this isn't real.
These are all crazy people.

324
00:18:52.471 --> 00:18:57.450
Cause I could tell being six that these were all just a bunch of maniacs is evil

325
00:18:57.451 --> 00:19:00.330
lady who liked to yell and scream at kids.

326
00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:02.990
She used to like to scare the shit out of you and tell you that she's going to

327
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.190
make you sit on a nail.
He sit in the,
he,

328
00:19:05.191 --> 00:19:08.580
she's going to make you sit in a closet on a nail and you're gonna make you

329
00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:11.370
bring,
you better bring your pillow,
cause you're gonna sleep here and you're not,

330
00:19:11.371 --> 00:19:12.360
you're never going home.

331
00:19:12.361 --> 00:19:15.370
Like she knew you wanted to get out of there so she would torture you until you,

332
00:19:15.371 --> 00:19:16.440
you're never going home.

333
00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:22.100
That con UN see that is weird weirdness that is like unconsensual as the nanny

334
00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:28.110
children.
Yeah.
That's a good,
that's a good way of looking at it.
Yeah.

335
00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:33.000
Yeah.
But I think it started out with that.
It started out,

336
00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:35.910
they probably,
you know,
it probably started out if you,

337
00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:40.650
if you really think about how much is good in Christianity,
love your brother,

338
00:19:40.651 --> 00:19:43.290
treat others as if they were yourself.
The,
the,

339
00:19:43.291 --> 00:19:47.520
the core tenants of Christianity about just the,
the work of Jesus.

340
00:19:47.521 --> 00:19:51.890
How he always was with the dregs of society and he didn't judge people at all

341
00:19:51.891 --> 00:19:55.920
and he tried to heal the sick.
All the things that are positive about it.

342
00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:57.630
You've got to think that there's some,

343
00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:02.490
some basis in religion is like things that people learned that really connect

344
00:20:02.491 --> 00:20:05.550
you to the happy life,
to the good life,
which is the life of love,

345
00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:09.270
the life of caring for each other.
So they figured these things out.

346
00:20:09.271 --> 00:20:12.300
But then in writing them down back then,

347
00:20:12.301 --> 00:20:16.590
especially like it wasn't until like the 15 hundreds of people read the Bible on

348
00:20:16.591 --> 00:20:19.640
a regular basis.
Most people couldn't read it.
There was a,

349
00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:23.160
you'd have to be like a scholar or you had to be someone who understood Latin or

350
00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:25.640
somebody could read Greek.
The,
the,

351
00:20:25.641 --> 00:20:29.490
the people of the common folks of the 15 hundreds they,
you know,

352
00:20:29.491 --> 00:20:32.130
that was what the big Martin Luther thing was about.

353
00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:36.510
It was Martin Luther was the first guy to create like a phonetic Bible that

354
00:20:36.511 --> 00:20:38.610
people could actually read.
And they were like,
wait a minute,

355
00:20:38.611 --> 00:20:42.450
this is not what we thought it was.
And that's what spawned Lutherism.

356
00:20:42.451 --> 00:20:46.980
Like their view of the Bible was completely different than what they'd been,

357
00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:51.940
and it made a huge issue because the church was trying to control who had access

358
00:20:51.941 --> 00:20:55.630
to that information.
Right?
Because if you had access to that information,

359
00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:57.070
you could tell people,
hey,

360
00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:59.920
this is what God wants you to do and you have to listen.
Right.

361
00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:02.590
And now all of a sudden people were able to read it for themselves.

362
00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:06.280
And so that took one layer of power away.
So we're,

363
00:21:06.281 --> 00:21:10.300
we're dealing with today is the most enlightened version of religion the world

364
00:21:10.301 --> 00:21:14.390
has ever known.
It's still a fucking crippled mess.
It's a total mass.
It's scary.

365
00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:17.830
It is scary,
but runs most of the world really.
Yup.

366
00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:19.960
This is because most of the world hasn't caught up yet,

367
00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:24.310
just like there was no cell phones and most of the world two decades ago,

368
00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:26.380
I think two decades from now,

369
00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:31.270
the idea of religion is going to be way,
way less common.

370
00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:35.770
Way less common.
So I'm almost positive it's not the idea of God.

371
00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:38.090
The idea of God will probably be more common.
Yeah.

372
00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:41.830
Because people will kind of understand that the word God is real slippery.

373
00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:46.180
You know?
[inaudible] you think as a dude in the clouds,
it's running everything,

374
00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:51.220
but if you took that word away and what do you,
you know,
just express it.

375
00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:56.170
Not a person,
not a thing,
but is there an energy?
Is there an idea?

376
00:21:56.171 --> 00:22:00.730
Is there an ideal ideal way of,
of living the world?

377
00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:02.970
What would be the godly way,
the godly way?

378
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.900
It'd be almost exactly what they say in the Bible.

379
00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:09.010
That's what it's supposed to be like that they manipulated it because why did

380
00:22:09.011 --> 00:22:12.850
they do that though?
I think because they wanted to start controlling the masses,

381
00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:16.330
so they made it a different thing that I really want.
It is what's also,

382
00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:20.530
how the fuck do you regulate people?
You know?
I'm sure if you're,

383
00:22:20.531 --> 00:22:23.020
especially if you're a dumb person,
live in a few hundred years ago,

384
00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:25.900
it's too hard to regulate people's too hard.
Again,

385
00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:29.230
you get a thousand people in a room and every one of them wants to be the king.

386
00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:29.530
Right.

387
00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:32.740
You know like who the fuck is going to w if you have some information they're

388
00:22:32.741 --> 00:22:36.070
not going to listen.
Now I've got my own information.
I'm starting my Scientology.

389
00:22:36.071 --> 00:22:38.080
It's the new one.
I got it,
I got it all over here.

390
00:22:38.081 --> 00:22:41.560
We got Mormonism is the shift what you guys are doing your trash.

391
00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:42.970
Jesus wrote some new Shit,

392
00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:46.420
you know and there's always going to be a new ego that wants to step to the

393
00:22:46.421 --> 00:22:51.421
center of the line and control the room and because of that it's almost like it

394
00:22:51.491 --> 00:22:55.990
was impossible to not have bullshit.
But if it wasn't for that religion,

395
00:22:56.290 --> 00:22:59.950
if it wasn't for a bunch of people that were put in line and scared and this is

396
00:22:59.951 --> 00:23:03.460
a terrible idea,
but I think it's probably true.

397
00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:05.620
I don't think we would have made it this far.
Hmm.

398
00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:09.010
I think people would have been way more barbaric.

399
00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:13.210
Like there's enough control unless there's only two ways around it.

400
00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:17.440
One is mushrooms.
If you gave me the mushrooms very young from,

401
00:23:17.441 --> 00:23:21.700
from like an early day on and then that would probably eliminate a lot of the

402
00:23:21.701 --> 00:23:24.880
need for it.
Look at certain cultures in the world,
like the Mayan people,

403
00:23:24.881 --> 00:23:26.260
they used all of that kind of stuff.

404
00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:29.650
I don't think that they were like freaking out on each other or had to do like

405
00:23:29.651 --> 00:23:33.430
some major.
He freaked out each other a lot.
The Mayans,

406
00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:36.880
they did a lot of human sacrifice.
Both really?
Yeah,
but I mean,

407
00:23:36.881 --> 00:23:41.350
it's Alina word judging that.
Right.
We probably should.
We should do it now.

408
00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:46.400
They killed the Mayan or the Aztecs when they built the,
the pyramid

409
00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:47.900
<v 5>of tio two ICAN,
I think it was.</v>

410
00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:52.970
They killed 80,000 people over a period of a few days.
I'll for days.

411
00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:56.640
Yeah.
Yeah.
At some insane amount of painful information.

412
00:23:57.060 --> 00:24:01.840
We didn't close the facts.
I'm like,
wait,

413
00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:04.650
the Aztecs that killed all the,
when they at the,

414
00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:07.730
upon the completion of the pyramid,
they killed all the slaves.

415
00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:11.810
All the prisoners that were,
that were helping them build these awesome building.

416
00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:15.140
They just cut their hearts out and fucking tossed them to the crowds.
I mean,

417
00:24:15.141 --> 00:24:18.680
that's Kinda hard core,
but I don't think the Mayans were that hard.
Oh yeah,

418
00:24:18.681 --> 00:24:21.980
they were.
Yeah,
they have.
They had,
if you ever go to Cheech and Eatsa,

419
00:24:21.981 --> 00:24:25.100
there's actually like an hour from teaching you if you've been to the one where

420
00:24:25.101 --> 00:24:26.410
you go to the temple and there's,

421
00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:29.390
there's a fucking big table where they cut people's hearts out on,

422
00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:33.380
it's like this,
this demon God looking thing.
And then he's,

423
00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:36.290
he's holding up this table and that's where they would cool.

424
00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:41.000
Carve people's fucking hearts out with,
you know,

425
00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:43.880
big courts,
knives.
I don't know what the fuck they did with it.

426
00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:47.480
And then there's also a lot of,
um,
thought that the Mayans,

427
00:24:47.481 --> 00:24:50.720
much like almost every civilization from ancient Egypt on,

428
00:24:50.721 --> 00:24:55.721
they start out really good and then everything just fucking crumbles apart as he

429
00:24:56.001 --> 00:25:00.500
gets several generations in.
So is that human nature?
It could be,
right.

430
00:25:00.501 --> 00:25:04.460
It's also,
I think what we're saying earlier,
I think it could be a part of this,

431
00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:09.230
this uh,
inability to completely understand each other because the,
the,

432
00:25:09.231 --> 00:25:12.710
the ability to lie through language and then also the,

433
00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:17.330
the people that develop these ideas and work so hard to create this culture and

434
00:25:17.331 --> 00:25:20.030
not the people that are born into it and enjoy it from the get go.

435
00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:24.170
Sort of like kids that are born rich.
They developed this like really spoiled.

436
00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:29.030
Like have you ever met someone who is like really intense and like super
focused,

437
00:25:29.031 --> 00:25:33.250
like some banker type character but it's sun,
it's just a complete waste.
Broad.

438
00:25:33.251 --> 00:25:37.430
I have cars.
Yeah.
Always,
always.
Even in Mexico there's that house.

439
00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:41.690
If there were really bad in Mexico,
kids are out of control.

440
00:25:41.691 --> 00:25:46.000
It's like they're all from Beverly Hills.
Like No.
Nothing to have to think.

441
00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:47.210
They don't have to do anything.

442
00:25:47.211 --> 00:25:50.780
So they have this attitude that everyone has their waiter or everyone is there,

443
00:25:50.781 --> 00:25:54.250
you know,
serving,
they have that attitude there.
Wow.
Yeah.

444
00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:56.440
The haves and have nots are much greater there.

445
00:25:57.050 --> 00:26:01.010
The difference between money and no money is insane there.
Yeah.

446
00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:05.190
And I had to get used to actually,
how did you choose the Yucatan?
Because uh,

447
00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:08.930
we looked around whether they want him to live and then we realize it's only an

448
00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:11.330
hour and a half flight from Houston.
It's like right across the water,

449
00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:15.380
close to the United States because I work so much in the u s it's just like I

450
00:26:15.381 --> 00:26:19.460
can commute to,
you know,
my work really easy and it wasn't a difficult situation.

451
00:26:19.461 --> 00:26:22.010
Do you ever feel like in danger there?

452
00:26:22.011 --> 00:26:25.850
Do you ever feel completely different than the rest of Mexico?

453
00:26:25.851 --> 00:26:28.490
It's like its own like country really.

454
00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:31.790
The actually wanted to separate from Mexico at one time and become their own

455
00:26:31.791 --> 00:26:34.800
country,
but Mexico said don't even try it.
Really?
Yeah.

456
00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:39.080
So it's really much different.
They're much more chilled out,
less.

457
00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:43.070
There's no murderers.
There's nothing there.
There's no violent.
Yeah.

458
00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:47.070
I live in the safest city in all of Mexico.
It's like we have no,

459
00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:50.580
no violence or anything.
No kidding.
Yeah,
it's unbelievable.

460
00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:55.620
I saw one thing on the news about some,
someone lit up a building on fire,

461
00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:59.280
the Yucatan.
That's very rare.
Yeah.

462
00:26:59.281 --> 00:27:01.980
It must be rare because it was the only time I ever heard about exactly.

463
00:27:01.981 --> 00:27:04.650
I mean it happens all the time and the rest of Mexico cause it's completely out

464
00:27:04.651 --> 00:27:07.230
of control.
If they legalize marijuana we would,
you know,

465
00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:12.240
I'm sure you know Mexico's quietly decriminalized all drugs.
Yes I do.

466
00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:15.660
It's kind of interesting isn't it?
Yes,
it is very interesting.
And they're smart,

467
00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:17.730
very smart,
very smart country.

468
00:27:17.731 --> 00:27:21.750
The government there is actually a little ahead of ours I think.
Real.
Yes.

469
00:27:21.751 --> 00:27:25.470
And a lot of ways,
I mean they already,
gay marriage was way legal long time ago,

470
00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:28.380
way before us.
I don't know how you feel about that,
but you know,

471
00:27:28.381 --> 00:27:31.140
it's like so stupid that we're fighting about who cares who gets married.

472
00:27:31.141 --> 00:27:33.360
It's a distraction.
I think it's a beach ball completely.

473
00:27:33.361 --> 00:27:36.580
I think it's a beach ball.
They toss up and you sort of have to swat.
Yeah.

474
00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:41.040
When you argue pro or con,
the important thing is to never resolve it.
Yes,

475
00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:44.450
exactly.
I told the story in the podcast before,
but,
uh,
I,

476
00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:48.600
I lived in San Francisco from age seven to 11 and my next door neighbors are

477
00:27:48.601 --> 00:27:50.940
these crazy gay guys used to get naked with my arm.

478
00:27:50.941 --> 00:27:54.070
They smoke weed and play song goes.
So I was around,
you know,

479
00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:57.990
gay people at a very early age.
And then when I was 11,
we moved to Florida,

480
00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:00.870
which is like the polar opposite of San Francisco.

481
00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:03.870
And all of a sudden I had this friend,
this friend,

482
00:28:03.871 --> 00:28:07.680
my friend candy and his dad was going crazy.
Dad at a newspaper was,

483
00:28:07.681 --> 00:28:11.790
I can't fucking believe this shit.
He slams the paper down and we were like,

484
00:28:11.791 --> 00:28:14.940
what's going on?
He's like,
these fucking queers want to get married.

485
00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:18.390
And it was to him it was,
it was like,

486
00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:22.110
it was something like that was infuriating.
It was really infuriating.

487
00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:26.460
And um,
I remember thinking at 11,
I'm like,
you fucking baby.

488
00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:29.180
What do you care?
Why would you care?

489
00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:31.800
It doesn't make any sense that you would get angry.

490
00:28:31.801 --> 00:28:34.140
Like how does that even affect you?
How does it affect,

491
00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:37.200
how does it affect people and affect people?
Because it's a,

492
00:28:37.201 --> 00:28:40.380
it's a germ that gets planted into the culture.

493
00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:45.000
The idea that it's a problem gets planted in the culture and then it just

494
00:28:45.001 --> 00:28:47.430
becomes something that people bring up and they want to think about their own

495
00:28:47.431 --> 00:28:50.160
real problem.
Right.
It's the same kind of same thing.

496
00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:54.030
Everything is everybody else.
Yeah.
Otherwise it doesn't make any sense.
I mean,

497
00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:57.810
the reality of gay dudes is just like the reality of dudes.

498
00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:01.350
There are nice dudes and there's dudes who will lie to you and try to fuck you

499
00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:02.190
clearly.
And that's,

500
00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:05.640
I used to work out at Gold's gym when I was on news radio and I've always said

501
00:29:05.641 --> 00:29:09.900
that I felt like a tasty morsel case.
Do,
did you ever use the toilet?

502
00:29:09.901 --> 00:29:14.550
I bet you did.
It pretty gangster get in there.
Um,

503
00:29:14.551 --> 00:29:16.830
but it's,
it's all gay guys.

504
00:29:16.831 --> 00:29:20.700
Like it's probably 80% gay guys and they grunting and sweating and it's very

505
00:29:20.701 --> 00:29:25.170
sexual environment lately,
you know?
And for a lot of people,
that's a,

506
00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:28.960
that's a horrifying place to go.
You know,
it's,
it's,

507
00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:34.230
a lot of gyms are like that though.
There are grunting,

508
00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:35.670
even if they're straight dads,

509
00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:40.050
but it's still very sexual and this kind of way we don't really talk about,

510
00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:42.220
by the way,
you should use straight in air quotes

511
00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:45.910
because there's a lot of those hives.

512
00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:49.620
Bodybuilder do as would be happy to suck a cock was sure.
You keep a secret.
Oh,

513
00:29:49.621 --> 00:29:53.470
I see him all the time on it.
Yeah.
My friend Rodney,
he's gay.

514
00:29:53.471 --> 00:29:56.020
He was always telling me about how many he would do straight.

515
00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:59.530
How many straight guys have let him blow him.
Yeah,
because that's not gay.

516
00:30:00.030 --> 00:30:02.770
Not Gay.
Was just leaving.
Amy and I only pay attention.

517
00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:06.370
Barely even know what's going on.
Um,
whatever,
whatever.

518
00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:09.280
If it doesn't come in your mouth,
it's on.
Cool.
Yeah.

519
00:30:09.370 --> 00:30:14.210
As long as you come in his mouth,
it's like it's a wash.
It's a push.
Yeah.

520
00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:18.370
Good dudes or creepers.
Dude's period.
Look,
I'm telling you,

521
00:30:18.371 --> 00:30:22.090
I used to be a woman and I became a man and I'm telling you,
I think differently.

522
00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:23.350
I react differently,

523
00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:28.470
my sexual fantasies or differently and I get it now I get why men are pigs.

524
00:30:29.410 --> 00:30:33.310
It's totally testosterone.
Testosterone is what created rape it,

525
00:30:33.311 --> 00:30:37.870
testosterone created war,
pillaging everything,
all the above,
everything.

526
00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:39.220
And,
and you know,

527
00:30:39.530 --> 00:30:44.100
this is like a thing that I'm doing in my act right now about how,
uh,

528
00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:48.160
the greatest warriors throughout history were gay.

529
00:30:48.161 --> 00:30:51.040
This is what a lot of people don't realize in today's Day and age where there's

530
00:30:51.041 --> 00:30:53.350
a separation between,
you know,

531
00:30:53.351 --> 00:30:56.890
a gay and straight people that there's,
you know,

532
00:30:56.891 --> 00:31:01.180
there's the CIC gay people and then there's the straight people that are just

533
00:31:01.181 --> 00:31:05.060
living by God's way and that,
you know,
we got to keep these gay people from Mary.

534
00:31:05.061 --> 00:31:10.061
And like everything that happened that got us into the 21st century involve gay

535
00:31:10.901 --> 00:31:15.340
warrior.
Right?
Awesome Spartans,
Romans,

536
00:31:15.341 --> 00:31:19.510
Athenian,
Samurais,
everyone was gay.
And that's one of those weird,

537
00:31:19.690 --> 00:31:23.230
regardless of if you're gay or not,
like you,

538
00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:27.040
like if you hate gay people,
you,
you literally have to hate,
I mean,

539
00:31:27.041 --> 00:31:30.810
not saying that,
you know,
a lot of the shit of the Romans and the Spartans,
he,

540
00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:35.440
they did some horrible,
ruthless,
evil fucking murderers shit.
However,

541
00:31:35.650 --> 00:31:40.270
that's what I sort of got people into the 21st century,
right?
I mean that's,

542
00:31:40.330 --> 00:31:43.180
they were gay people.
That's a fact.

543
00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:46.980
But it's so weird to me that people are so concerned.
It's,
it's,

544
00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:51.340
it's their sexual preference and it,
that's all it's based on.
So like,

545
00:31:51.341 --> 00:31:55.860
I don't really care who you fuck.
Why do you care?
Why exactly.
That's exactly,

546
00:31:56.430 --> 00:31:57.640
and that's what it should be.
Right.

547
00:31:57.670 --> 00:32:02.290
But I think more men are weirded out by it then women are scared,
scared,

548
00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:05.650
scared because they might be attractive.
What I might,
you know what I mean?

549
00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:08.890
And so when I came along and I,
you know,
I,
I,
I have a pussy,

550
00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:11.320
so guys were like attracted to me,
but not sure.

551
00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:13.210
That's straight guys and gay guys.

552
00:32:13.211 --> 00:32:17.110
And they're looking fuse like what does that mean?
Am I gay or no,

553
00:32:17.111 --> 00:32:20.710
I'm not gay because he has a pussy.
So that doesn't make me,
I'm like,
dude,

554
00:32:20.711 --> 00:32:22.870
it doesn't make him anything about horny.
Just relax.

555
00:32:22.871 --> 00:32:27.310
It's not really a big fucking deal.
But guys are like,
they're always thinking,

556
00:32:27.311 --> 00:32:30.490
how can I,
not if I'm attracted to that,
am I gay or am I strange?
Well,

557
00:32:30.491 --> 00:32:33.250
even that statement,
it doesn't make anything in the heart.
We relaxed.

558
00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:36.310
That's a guy statement.
It's a guy statement and girl would never say that.
No,

559
00:32:36.311 --> 00:32:38.780
they would go,
well you know you have to think about your emotional.

560
00:32:39.050 --> 00:32:43.340
What do you have invested in this?
I read some thing.
I read something,

561
00:32:43.341 --> 00:32:44.630
I tried to read it.

562
00:32:44.631 --> 00:32:48.350
I blacked out from irony and logic halfway into it,

563
00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:51.650
but it was a male feminist guide to dating a woman.

564
00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:55.460
Some guy wrote this fucking Tldr,

565
00:32:55.461 --> 00:33:00.461
too long didn't read and massive multi fucking step way to to be a male feminist

566
00:33:02.901 --> 00:33:06.260
and date women and how to approach each and every scenario.

567
00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:10.520
Like the biggest pussy.
What bitch?
And not even,

568
00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:12.740
because not all women are the same.

569
00:33:12.741 --> 00:33:16.100
Some women like to actually be like dudes and just go have sex and it's not

570
00:33:16.101 --> 00:33:19.070
really a big deal and we have to be emotional.
Some girls are like that by them.

571
00:33:19.071 --> 00:33:20.240
There's a lot of girls like that.

572
00:33:20.270 --> 00:33:22.820
They don't really want to have all that emotional stuff though,
you know,

573
00:33:22.821 --> 00:33:25.400
whatever it was.
But it was so specific.

574
00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:30.910
It was so specific as to how you should deal with each and every situation and

575
00:33:31.251 --> 00:33:36.070
you know how you should call after sex and make sure that it was okay and where,

576
00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:39.440
where we're standing and I want to let you know how I feel and like,

577
00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:42.930
do you know that is like the easiest way to get a chick to fucking never call

578
00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:45.640
you again and you're like,
you need me bitch.

579
00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:49.280
And I guarantee you the guy who wrote that has no fucking,

580
00:33:49.310 --> 00:33:53.550
I like to keep a girl in his life,
but why does he think he knows that from?

581
00:33:53.551 --> 00:33:58.160
Cause he probably has some dominant female voice in his life that he's trying to

582
00:33:58.161 --> 00:34:03.161
placate some she demon that controls his testicle strings and he wants to write

583
00:34:03.351 --> 00:34:04.580
to appease her.
Yeah,

584
00:34:04.581 --> 00:34:09.440
I've written something I can attribute to your vagina and he gets to read it out

585
00:34:09.441 --> 00:34:12.410
and look,
I'm,
I'm the most sensitive man who's ever lived.

586
00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:14.570
I'm more sensitive than a woman.

587
00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:18.590
I see your sensitivity coming and I check it with double sensitivity.

588
00:34:18.650 --> 00:34:22.250
I totally know those guys will be Internet mocks them.

589
00:34:22.251 --> 00:34:25.160
They're called White Knights and they shouldn't be.
They should be mocked.

590
00:34:25.180 --> 00:34:26.270
I they called Whiteness.

591
00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:29.390
Just because you can write a blog doesn't mean it's right flux.

592
00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:33.650
You crazy ass internet right there.
When the electricity goes off,

593
00:34:33.651 --> 00:34:38.420
you will starve to death.
You will not make it right.
You do not have,

594
00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:42.710
I was married to a dominate tricks.
Those guys,
I know them.

595
00:34:42.930 --> 00:34:47.510
It all now their world there.
What's that like?
Very strange.

596
00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:50.180
Like really strict,
like you can't even imagine the kinds that,
you know,

597
00:34:50.181 --> 00:34:52.160
it's all good.
It's consensual.
It's a trip.

598
00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:55.910
A lot of those kinds of guys that are very into that.
Well I have a buddy,

599
00:34:55.911 --> 00:35:00.260
my buddy Jim Norton loves that shit and we were at a restaurant once in Austin,

600
00:35:00.261 --> 00:35:02.720
Texas.
This nice gal came over to the table,

601
00:35:02.721 --> 00:35:06.050
started talking to us because she knew that he was into that and she's a

602
00:35:06.051 --> 00:35:10.520
dominatrix.
So she started talking dominatrix talk.
She was very friendly.

603
00:35:10.521 --> 00:35:15.020
So she was telling us like what kind of clients she has without revealing their

604
00:35:15.021 --> 00:35:15.854
names,
of course.

605
00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:19.150
But she was saying she deals with a lot of like really powerful businessman.

606
00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:23.780
They run shit all day,
but then at the end of the day it's,
you know,

607
00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:27.380
what do you,
what do you want me to do,
mommy?
Yes.
Mommy.
Yes.
Mommy.

608
00:35:27.381 --> 00:35:32.300
They call her mommy.
One boundary I have is the baby play like everything else,

609
00:35:32.301 --> 00:35:35.090
but like baby can't steal it.
Can't deal with the adult.

610
00:35:35.091 --> 00:35:38.020
Maybe you don't even think they were going with baby.
I think they were going to

611
00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:43.020
<v 4>was like complete week man who lives at home with his mom was screams at him all</v>

612
00:35:43.171 --> 00:35:46.830
the time and tells him what to do.
Like it was like he wanted to be humiliated.

613
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:51.180
Yeah.
Pipis pissing his mouth,
all that.
And also like,
um,

614
00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:55.450
financial domination.
That's also a vague line really.
Were they like praying?

615
00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:56.393
She'll be like,

616
00:35:56.420 --> 00:36:01.420
bring $3,000 with you and cash all twenties and he shows that with $3,000 all

617
00:36:03.181 --> 00:36:05.100
twenties and she goes,
give it to me.

618
00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:10.000
And she takes it from him and that's like the scene.
Wow.
I'm like,

619
00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:14.710
that's a good job.
You know what?
It makes sense.
It makes sense.
There's,

620
00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:19.530
it takes everything to make this thing work.
There's like there's Yin and Yang,

621
00:36:19.531 --> 00:36:23.580
there's plus and minuses.
Every fucking little puzzle piece fits in together.

622
00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:26.130
And imagine if you have the job of a,
you know,

623
00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:31.020
corporate CEO and you have to stress out all day long.
I mean,
that's hard core.

624
00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:34.410
You want to just go have a spanking after that.
I couldn't even imagine.

625
00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:37.020
And to have millions and millions of dollars on the line.

626
00:36:37.050 --> 00:36:41.370
Every decision every day.
Yeah.
I couldn't imagine.
I mean I've,

627
00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:43.380
I've tried,
you know,

628
00:36:43.381 --> 00:36:46.620
running a television show and it's fucking mom and that's just entertainment.

629
00:36:46.650 --> 00:36:51.030
Yeah.
That's silly.
And,
and temporary,
you know,
six episodes and you know,

630
00:36:51.031 --> 00:36:54.570
it's over at the end and still your free stress is like,
oh,
insane.

631
00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:58.770
It breaks your brain.
I feel way different when I'm stressed.

632
00:36:58.771 --> 00:37:02.670
My decision making's not so good.
I'm right too,
too edgy.
Oh,

633
00:37:02.671 --> 00:37:06.600
like bark when I shouldn't,
I,
I won't think things through.
It's like,
it's just,

634
00:37:06.601 --> 00:37:09.400
you're constantly you to keep yourself calm and how do you keep yourself calm

635
00:37:09.401 --> 00:37:13.620
and focused?
Furious.
Exercise.
The only thing that gets it out of me,

636
00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:17.790
it has to be heavy bag.
Like,
just beat the shit out of a bag,

637
00:37:17.791 --> 00:37:21.840
do some kettle bell workouts,
run up a hill,
sprint up hills.
For me,

638
00:37:21.841 --> 00:37:25.830
it has to be something where I'm fighting life or death because I think that

639
00:37:25.831 --> 00:37:29.340
those feelings of stress that you get the,
those are life,
death,

640
00:37:29.341 --> 00:37:32.760
struggle type things because it's incredibly stressful,
you know?

641
00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:37.020
And I think those,
even if it's like something as silly as a television show,

642
00:37:37.021 --> 00:37:38.190
if it's important to you,

643
00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:43.160
you're going to get an intense amount of like energy focused on that.
I don't,

644
00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:45.870
at least my body doesn't know what the fuck is going on.
Right.

645
00:37:45.871 --> 00:37:46.641
And that those scenarios,

646
00:37:46.641 --> 00:37:49.590
it thinks like we're going to have to fucking fight with swords or one from

647
00:37:49.591 --> 00:37:51.990
dragons or we've got to do some shit,
man.
Right.

648
00:37:51.991 --> 00:37:54.720
And so unless I blow it out,

649
00:37:54.750 --> 00:37:57.600
unless I just blow it out to the point where my heart feels like it's going to

650
00:37:57.601 --> 00:38:01.810
rip out of my chest,
then I,
I don't,
I don't ever calm down.
Yeah.
No,

651
00:38:01.830 --> 00:38:03.540
I think I can relate to that.
Totally.

652
00:38:03.570 --> 00:38:06.120
I feel so much more calm after I had a hardcore workout.

653
00:38:06.121 --> 00:38:10.470
Or your body is designed,
you know,
our bodies,

654
00:38:10.471 --> 00:38:15.471
the DNA of our bodies is from an animal that was running from Jaguars a hundred

655
00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:18.580
thousand years ago,
200,000 years ago,
a million years ago.
There's this,

656
00:38:18.581 --> 00:38:23.581
the same echoes of that primal time when we were so vulnerable and surrounded by

657
00:38:24.541 --> 00:38:28.410
predators at all times,
including human predators.
You know,

658
00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:31.620
I think that shit is just,
it's in our system still and took,

659
00:38:31.621 --> 00:38:35.350
what about attendance?
Not Women had it run.
Two women had to fight.

660
00:38:35.351 --> 00:38:38.720
Two women had to stay alive.
Women had to protect their babies.
I mean,

661
00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:41.890
they didn't have to do it as much or often.
And of course,

662
00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:46.360
the plus and the minus of testosterone is the minuses.
I mean,

663
00:38:46.361 --> 00:38:50.710
they're actually proven that men with larger testicles make shittier fathers.

664
00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:54.440
I'll,
yeah,
I did read that recently.
It's incredible.
It's incredible.

665
00:38:54.441 --> 00:38:56.070
It's incredible.
It's so,
it's so cool.

666
00:38:56.110 --> 00:39:00.340
They've also proven that men with larger testicles around women who are more

667
00:39:00.341 --> 00:39:02.740
promiscuous and the more promiscuous the women,

668
00:39:02.770 --> 00:39:06.070
the larger the testicles of the men in the community.
We'll have.
Oh Wow.

669
00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:09.070
Because they produce more testosterone,
so they'll be more crazy.
Exactly.

670
00:39:09.071 --> 00:39:12.070
And there'll be less likely to stick around and raise their children.

671
00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:15.900
Whereas women who have much less testosterone,
they will raise the children.

672
00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:19.900
It's almost like nature sets you up.
If you're going to be nurture,

673
00:39:19.901 --> 00:39:22.570
you gotta be understanding and peaceful.
You want to be a calm thing.

674
00:39:22.571 --> 00:39:26.590
You want to be a thing that doesn't have this fucking write up all the time,

675
00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:30.700
ready to go,
you know?
And and men in that high pressure,

676
00:39:30.701 --> 00:39:33.940
high stress situation like,
you know,
in the jungle or something like that,

677
00:39:33.941 --> 00:39:35.790
are ready to go.
You've got to protect,
you gotta defend.

678
00:39:35.791 --> 00:39:38.330
You got to hunt to get to the things have to be done on a,

679
00:39:38.350 --> 00:39:42.180
in a split second notice.
And that's all the testosterone.
It cannot see this,

680
00:39:42.181 --> 00:39:46.990
this weird Yin and Yang of the light.
And I noticed for myself though,

681
00:39:46.991 --> 00:39:50.500
I calmed,
I used to be very much like that before I started taking testosterone.

682
00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:55.390
And when I took the testosterone,
I like became a much calmer,
more focused,

683
00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:59.710
more happy person than I did when I just had estrogen in my body.

684
00:39:59.890 --> 00:40:03.700
That's fascinating.
Completely.
Where people,
you know,
use that roid rage,

685
00:40:04.050 --> 00:40:07.660
which is all complete total bullshit.
Well,
it isn't.
It isn't.
I mean,
I've seen it.

686
00:40:07.810 --> 00:40:10.780
I've seen it,
seen it.
Yeah.
I've seen it have,
without a doubt,

687
00:40:10.781 --> 00:40:15.760
100% when men amount of Ted stomps.
Easy to do though,

688
00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:18.730
if you're around men who want to be great big bodybuilders,
right?

689
00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:20.330
There's only one way to do that.
You,

690
00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:24.670
you have to Jack yourself up the way above the limits.
Right.
You know,

691
00:40:24.671 --> 00:40:25.450
and you see,

692
00:40:25.450 --> 00:40:28.120
I've seen people just completely lose their mind where they're like animals.

693
00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:28.590
They like,

694
00:40:28.590 --> 00:40:32.140
it's like being around a gorilla cause they're just juiced up to the gills.

695
00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:35.940
They just an extraordinary amount of,

696
00:40:36.170 --> 00:40:40.090
I'm sure like 50 million tons of whatever it is.
You don't think it's that much?

697
00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:42.230
But I said,
yeah,
I know what you're saying.
Well that's,

698
00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:46.900
if you see like that's the dirt.
It's not the dirty little secret.
It's the dirty,

699
00:40:46.901 --> 00:40:50.050
obvious secret of bodybuilding,
right?
If you see one of those guys,

700
00:40:50.051 --> 00:40:52.360
those enormous guys,
that doesn't make any sense.

701
00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:56.170
The reason why it doesn't make any sense cause you know in your head you have

702
00:40:56.171 --> 00:40:58.450
like a spectrum in your head.
Okay,
well if you're just,

703
00:40:58.451 --> 00:41:00.120
if you're a man and you have to stoss drone,

704
00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:04.470
you lift weights like a crazy feeling you can get about that big,
right?

705
00:41:04.471 --> 00:41:06.610
Maybe that big.
If you've got super special genetics,

706
00:41:06.611 --> 00:41:11.611
but what's this around the circle four or five times like you know,

707
00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:14.560
you remember those things at the carnival you hit and it looks Dell goes up,

708
00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:19.390
rings the bell.
These mother fuckers shot it to the moon.
Like they're so big.

709
00:41:19.391 --> 00:41:21.100
That doesn't even make sense like this.

710
00:41:21.101 --> 00:41:23.020
It's not possible to get there without drugs.

711
00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:27.520
The Dysport literally cannot exist,
but don't they?

712
00:41:27.970 --> 00:41:29.410
Like it doesn't make sense to me.
The whole,

713
00:41:29.770 --> 00:41:33.530
the whole professional bodybuilding thing because people are tech nine taking

714
00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:38.720
<v 3>steroids.
They have to though for those sponsor companies,</v>

715
00:41:38.930 --> 00:41:43.090
like they get their money test.
You,
I don't know.
I mean,
you know,

716
00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:47.080
they probably do,
but guys can get around it if they,
even if they do test,

717
00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:49.520
if they test you,
it's ridiculous.
They'd be,
you know,

718
00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:55.040
that's the reason why the NBA doesn't test for weed.
The NBA,
the NBA.
No,

719
00:41:55.041 --> 00:41:59.450
they,
you know,
I think people have been popped for it somehow or another.
Um,

720
00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:02.870
but very rarely.
And the reason is the,
the,
the,

721
00:42:02.871 --> 00:42:06.610
the players union knows that a giant percentage of those dudes around weed

722
00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:12.200
smoking weed makes you sensitive to space and distances and stuff.

723
00:42:12.201 --> 00:42:13.850
Like a lot of pool players smoke weed.

724
00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:18.950
A lot of basketball players love to smoke weed and it helps your bright before

725
00:42:18.951 --> 00:42:22.250
they applied.
Yeah.
I like it.
Narrowed it out.
I'd be like,
Oh yeah,

726
00:42:22.251 --> 00:42:23.084
but you could though.

727
00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:26.960
I bet you could if were to chai and black dude and you were good at basketball

728
00:42:26.961 --> 00:42:30.980
and my last life.
Yeah.

729
00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:35.690
They love to smoke weed and,
and it's awesome,
isn't it?
Bulletproof coffee.

730
00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:37.070
Um,

731
00:42:37.070 --> 00:42:42.070
when did you know that you like the concept of gender identity to someone who

732
00:42:42.321 --> 00:42:44.660
doesn't struggle with it is,
um,

733
00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:48.020
it's one of those things where you try to wrap your head around and he tried to

734
00:42:48.021 --> 00:42:49.790
understand it,
but you'd never,
it's like,

735
00:42:50.810 --> 00:42:53.390
why don't we say that a man and woman never really understand each other.

736
00:42:53.391 --> 00:42:58.391
They just sort of get this thing where they accept that this is how you are and

737
00:42:58.701 --> 00:42:59.780
this is,
but I never,

738
00:42:59.970 --> 00:43:03.110
I'll never understand what it's like to want a baby in my body.

739
00:43:03.111 --> 00:43:05.630
I never understand what it's like to have my period.
I'll never,

740
00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:09.260
I'll never get it.
I'll never understand what it's like in any way.

741
00:43:09.770 --> 00:43:14.770
And being a woman and then feeling like you're in the wrong sex.

742
00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:18.830
What is that like and how did you,
when did you realize it?

743
00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:23.180
It's imagine if you felt all of a sudden,
one day he started saying,
I feel like,

744
00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:28.190
oh,
a girl.
It would freak you out.
Yeah.
Oh,
without a doubt.

745
00:43:28.220 --> 00:43:30.230
Without a doubt.
I really most,

746
00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:32.360
I mean I can just tell you what most of my life I felt that way,

747
00:43:32.361 --> 00:43:35.570
but my parents did raise me like a boy.
Even though I was a little girl,

748
00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:38.720
they completely raised me like a boy cause I wasn't very much of a Tomboy,

749
00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:39.391
you know,

750
00:43:39.391 --> 00:43:43.610
little tomboys or okay a girl who looks like a little boy and you know you're

751
00:43:43.611 --> 00:43:46.010
tan and you dress like a little boy.
That's okay in this country,

752
00:43:46.011 --> 00:43:49.730
nobody freaks out on that.
It's when you start reaching,
you know,

753
00:43:49.731 --> 00:43:53.540
puberty and he started,
I started growing breasts and then I started,
you know,

754
00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:56.060
getting my period.
That's when everything shifted.

755
00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:59.510
It was totally okay my childhood.
But then people are like,
ah,

756
00:43:59.870 --> 00:44:03.200
you need to start treating her like her.
Not like he,

757
00:44:03.201 --> 00:44:06.380
my parents were completely freaked out because they always just,

758
00:44:06.381 --> 00:44:09.960
it was like okay.
It was never an issue because I was just like a Tom boy.

759
00:44:09.961 --> 00:44:11.090
And then when that happened,

760
00:44:11.091 --> 00:44:14.690
I think that's when I'll like basically everything all hell broke loose,

761
00:44:14.691 --> 00:44:15.220
you know,

762
00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:18.950
it was it your folks that have the issue or the community that had the issue,

763
00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:21.710
your neighborhood community,
their friends kept saying,

764
00:44:21.711 --> 00:44:26.560
you've got to stop calling her.
He and the boy name it said,

765
00:44:26.561 --> 00:44:28.910
girl.
You know what I mean?
Fuck.

766
00:44:28.911 --> 00:44:32.310
Do they care what gender is such a freaky,

767
00:44:32.311 --> 00:44:36.690
weird thing for people in our,
in the world.
Basically Amanda is this,

768
00:44:36.691 --> 00:44:38.470
and a woman is that your,

769
00:44:38.570 --> 00:44:42.660
your penis makes you a man and your vagina makes you a woman that's just black

770
00:44:42.661 --> 00:44:45.810
and white.
For most people in the whole wide world.
That's just how it works.

771
00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:51.260
And so basically that's not true because it's really how you feel inside your

772
00:44:51.301 --> 00:44:56.301
outer presence is just the shell of your soul and your being really,

773
00:44:56.581 --> 00:44:58.080
I mean,
it's,
to me it's that simple.

774
00:44:58.081 --> 00:45:01.110
But of course people don't get it because people always take things at face

775
00:45:01.111 --> 00:45:04.650
value.
They don't tend to get to know you or,
I mean,

776
00:45:04.651 --> 00:45:08.370
I'm sitting right in front of you now.
Would you say that I am a woman?

777
00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:12.390
No,
no,
thank you.
Have a beard.

778
00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:20.070
Beard.
Yeah.
No,
you know,
basically a man.
Thank you.

779
00:45:20.071 --> 00:45:25.020
I appreciate that compliment from him,
but you know what I'm saying?

780
00:45:25.021 --> 00:45:29.760
Like the minute someone finds out that I have a pussy,
it's like,

781
00:45:29.761 --> 00:45:32.160
no,
you're,
you're uh,
well,
you know what?

782
00:45:32.161 --> 00:45:35.040
I think one day we're going to have a pill and you're just going to be able to

783
00:45:35.070 --> 00:45:39.000
be a giraffe for a,
you know what I mean?
I really think that,

784
00:45:39.001 --> 00:45:42.660
I think that they're going to be able to manipulate the human body to an extent

785
00:45:42.661 --> 00:45:44.670
where it be unrecognizable.

786
00:45:44.671 --> 00:45:48.540
I think we're going to be able to manipulate our genes to be,
look,
look,

787
00:45:48.541 --> 00:45:50.890
doctor Manhattan or something like,
totally.
I don't think it's,

788
00:45:50.930 --> 00:45:55.560
I think the human frame is right now is something that we feel like is

789
00:45:55.561 --> 00:45:59.520
completely outside of the realm of control,
but I think that's really temporary.

790
00:45:59.521 --> 00:46:02.490
Just as temporary as we didn't think we were ever going to be able to

791
00:46:02.491 --> 00:46:06.560
communicate with somebody in real time in Australia 150,000 years,
I don't know.

792
00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:10.230
But today it's nothing,
and that's exactly what it's going to be like.

793
00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:12.990
Whether it's 150 years from now or whatever,
you're,

794
00:46:12.991 --> 00:46:14.880
your body's no longer going to define you.

795
00:46:14.890 --> 00:46:17.640
You're going to be able to be whatever you want and people are going to be able

796
00:46:17.641 --> 00:46:22.110
to switch back and forth.
Which from nearly Cox.
Yeah,
like this month I'm a girl,

797
00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:24.780
I'm a guy,
I want to be already happening.
You know,

798
00:46:24.810 --> 00:46:26.880
people are already doing the gender queer thing.

799
00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:29.160
Are they where they're not saying I'm male or female.

800
00:46:29.161 --> 00:46:32.520
And then there's like this new kind of thing called bay where they don't want to

801
00:46:32.521 --> 00:46:36.160
identify as male or female and they're just,
they,
they're just day.
Yeah.

802
00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:40.840
That's awesome.
That's,
I like to have a friend who's a day.

803
00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:44.730
So every time I see her,
she used to be a herb and now she's a Va.

804
00:46:44.890 --> 00:46:49.030
She always has to correct me because I'm always like saying her or she.

805
00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:52.800
And so how do you,
what is the Pronoun for that?
It's very,
it's day.

806
00:46:53.660 --> 00:46:57.750
Hmm.
I know it doesn't make any sense because it's not them.

807
00:46:58.670 --> 00:46:59.290
So,

808
00:46:59.290 --> 00:47:04.290
so you don't ever say he say she say they as as an individual as a day,

809
00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:06.150
yeah.
Oh Wow.

810
00:47:06.270 --> 00:47:11.070
Try it to Greg's need too much work that they need so much God damn attention.

811
00:47:12.330 --> 00:47:15.900
Like all these labels and things that people are so obsessed with.
Right.

812
00:47:16.070 --> 00:47:20.490
That's a real problem.
It's a real problem because now it's not LGBT.
It's,

813
00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:21.510
you know,

814
00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:26.510
now it's Q I a queer intersex and they,

815
00:47:27.530 --> 00:47:29.840
and we have to add a t what I see.

816
00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:34.330
<v 6>Yeah,
I see.
What,
what is queer?
What's the difference?
Queer is more based on your,</v>

817
00:47:34.331 --> 00:47:36.380
I think your sexuality and how,

818
00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:39.100
and and actually it kind of can encompass your gender.

819
00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:40.500
So it's more of an all encompassing,

820
00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:44.560
fluid fluidity with your gender and sexuality where you're not necessarily

821
00:47:44.561 --> 00:47:49.510
saying I'm a he and I'm gay.
You might be a she and straight this day,

822
00:47:49.511 --> 00:47:53.260
but tomorrow you want to be a man and gay

823
00:47:53.350 --> 00:47:57.140
<v 5>people are so specific.
I'm even getting all right.
Even me,
I'm just like,</v>

824
00:47:57.200 --> 00:48:01.010
I know I'm just a man.
Dude,
I know are so specific.

825
00:48:01.210 --> 00:48:03.250
<v 6>That's what I'm saying is getting a little bit,
okay,</v>

826
00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:04.990
here's the deal with my education.

827
00:48:04.991 --> 00:48:08.050
That's why I always just sort of try to make it as easy as possible for being

828
00:48:08.051 --> 00:48:10.270
home because I don't really go to that level at this point.

829
00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:13.540
I want you first to understand that gender is complex,

830
00:48:13.570 --> 00:48:14.920
but at the same time it's not.

831
00:48:14.950 --> 00:48:19.060
It's really how you feel as a person and that people are understanding that,

832
00:48:19.061 --> 00:48:22.570
you know,
I can be whoever I want to be and you and it's okay.

833
00:48:22.571 --> 00:48:25.810
Does it matter what the world people are starting to be more open minded about

834
00:48:25.811 --> 00:48:26.644
it?
They are.

835
00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:29.830
And it's really important that people understand that it's going to evolve

836
00:48:29.831 --> 00:48:32.050
whether you like it or not.
Yeah,

837
00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:33.500
<v 5>well gender's complex,</v>

838
00:48:33.590 --> 00:48:38.000
but for some people they don't want it to ever be complex because one of the

839
00:48:38.330 --> 00:48:40.880
things that's admirable about a man as a man,

840
00:48:40.881 --> 00:48:45.140
it doesn't worry what Sandro bottom man is a man who's just like fucking silent

841
00:48:45.141 --> 00:48:48.740
Clint Eastwood and the movie's type doesn't give a fuck cause never thinking

842
00:48:48.741 --> 00:48:52.730
about sucking Dicks,
just out there trying to shoot people,
you know,

843
00:48:52.731 --> 00:48:57.731
like without a care in the world and keeps his heartbeat of steady 62 you know,

844
00:48:57.770 --> 00:49:00.800
never really freaks out.
That's a,
that's a part of,

845
00:49:00.801 --> 00:49:05.630
of being a man is being sure of your site and if you're unsure of your
sexuality,

846
00:49:05.870 --> 00:49:08.320
you know you're a vulnerable animal.

847
00:49:08.900 --> 00:49:11.430
<v 6>But also I've learned to be very vulnerable.
And when,
you know,</v>

848
00:49:11.431 --> 00:49:14.630
I do a lot of public speaking and I talk about my childhood and my life and I

849
00:49:14.631 --> 00:49:16.850
had a lot of stuff happened to me and you know,
I committed,

850
00:49:16.910 --> 00:49:20.810
tried to commit suicide many times and I just hated my life and I was like total

851
00:49:20.811 --> 00:49:21.181
nightmare.

852
00:49:21.181 --> 00:49:24.410
And I get vulnerable when I speak and I have cried in public like that.

853
00:49:24.411 --> 00:49:27.830
And actually it feels really good to go there sometimes because I know it

854
00:49:27.831 --> 00:49:31.130
doesn't make me feel any less of a man.
I'm a very,
very confident,

855
00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:32.660
very sure of myself,
man.

856
00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:37.580
But to be vulnerable sometimes lets people understand your story a lot more and

857
00:49:37.581 --> 00:49:40.190
lets them come into your life without smelling.
Yeah.

858
00:49:40.191 --> 00:49:43.130
There's nothing wrong with being vulnerable.
That's a silly idea.

859
00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:47.510
Especially for men.
Really.
I'm telling you,
especially for men,

860
00:49:47.511 --> 00:49:51.350
a lot of us men really feel like we're not allowed to go there because it's not,

861
00:49:51.351 --> 00:49:54.660
you're not a man if you let yourself be,
and that's totally bullshit.

862
00:49:54.890 --> 00:49:59.060
<v 5>Well,
it isn't.
It isn't.
And it isn't.
If you're being a bitch,
okay.</v>

863
00:49:59.090 --> 00:50:02.060
If you're crying for no fucking reason,
but that's the problem.

864
00:50:02.061 --> 00:50:05.840
There's some people that cry for no reason.
Like to get a flat tire,
flat tire.

865
00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:09.580
You're being a bitch,
right?

866
00:50:11.250 --> 00:50:14.880
Dad and expressing love or talking about your childhood and your feet towards

867
00:50:14.881 --> 00:50:16.830
moments or feelings.
Yeah.
Yeah.

868
00:50:16.850 --> 00:50:19.950
But if you crying over your fighting your flat tire edge,
yeah,
I'm driving by it.

869
00:50:19.951 --> 00:50:23.900
It does not of that though.
It's like it's important to differentiate right.

870
00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:26.960
The difference between a person who is vulnerable because they're honest,

871
00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:30.110
their emotions and passionate.
You know,
if you're passionate,

872
00:50:30.111 --> 00:50:34.520
like did I cry easy man,
I cry,
I'll cry it a good commercial,
I'll cry.

873
00:50:34.521 --> 00:50:37.910
And certain songs,
there's songs that hit me and I start crying.
Right.
You know,

874
00:50:37.911 --> 00:50:42.650
movies,
I hate depressing movies because I cry like a little bitch,
you know?

875
00:50:42.650 --> 00:50:47.060
Cause I'm,
I'm a very passionate person,
so I get locked into anything.

876
00:50:47.061 --> 00:50:49.370
Like if I'm a involved in anyone's art,

877
00:50:49.550 --> 00:50:53.360
whether it's a song or a movie or anything where you're,
you're,

878
00:50:53.570 --> 00:50:56.100
you're painting this picture of torture,
of torment,

879
00:50:56.101 --> 00:50:59.690
and I can relate to that character.
It's hard.
You know,
you feel it.

880
00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:04.870
That's not [inaudible] go there.
And you know that those are actually the week.

881
00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:07.940
I think you're right.
Yeah,
they're scared.
They're fake scared.

882
00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:12.260
And if you don't understand what real fear is,
when you actually face it,

883
00:51:12.290 --> 00:51:15.800
if you're constantly like hiding from like,

884
00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:19.490
like your actual emotions and pretending you're not scared when you actually are

885
00:51:19.491 --> 00:51:21.950
vulnerable,
then when you really are in danger,

886
00:51:21.951 --> 00:51:23.570
you're not going to know what the fuck to do.
Right.

887
00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:24.800
Because you don't know yourself,
right?

888
00:51:24.980 --> 00:51:28.460
You don't know what you really are capable of.
You don't know who you really are,

889
00:51:28.580 --> 00:51:31.700
so when the chips pile up,
you're going to just piss your pants and fall apart.

890
00:51:31.730 --> 00:51:35.630
But men are taught that.
We're taught that from an early age man or not.

891
00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:39.470
I really think so.
I don't know why though.
Why bitches for dads?

892
00:51:39.830 --> 00:51:41.720
There's a lot of dudes out there that are just bitches.

893
00:51:41.721 --> 00:51:43.370
They just fucked some chick,
get her pregnant,

894
00:51:43.371 --> 00:51:47.840
and then they have a kid and that kid grows up with a bitch for a dad.
That's,

895
00:51:47.930 --> 00:51:50.150
that's super common.
Yeah,
it is really cool.

896
00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:53.270
I had a friend who had a fucking tremendous bitch for a dad.

897
00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:56.480
His Dad would wind so much,
I would want to smack them in front of my friend.

898
00:51:56.690 --> 00:51:59.680
I would go over it and then the guy would,
he was always so confused,
like,

899
00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:02.810
I don't know what to do.
You forgot to list.
Stop.
Listen to your fucking dad.

900
00:52:02.811 --> 00:52:05.120
All right.
That's the first thing that I do,
right?
Look at that guy.

901
00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:07.880
If you didn't know that guy,
you would think that guy's a fucking idiot.
Right?

902
00:52:07.881 --> 00:52:11.510
Okay.
He cries over nothing.
He's constantly whining.
He's always negative.

903
00:52:11.630 --> 00:52:12.463
The guy's a bitch.

904
00:52:12.490 --> 00:52:15.440
You need to get the fuck out of that toxic environment the first chance you get,

905
00:52:16.190 --> 00:52:18.800
you know,
and that kind of shit.
Growing up,

906
00:52:18.801 --> 00:52:21.540
this guy had no confidence about anything.
He was just,

907
00:52:22.020 --> 00:52:24.110
he didn't know what he liked.
He didn't know what to do.

908
00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:27.500
He had to ask everybody before he did anything.
It asks your opinion.

909
00:52:27.860 --> 00:52:30.890
He didn't even know who the fuck you was.
Right?
He was never,

910
00:52:30.891 --> 00:52:34.880
he was never shown that it was possible to know who the fuck you where he was

911
00:52:34.881 --> 00:52:36.140
imitating this scared,

912
00:52:36.200 --> 00:52:39.510
terrified thing in his house and it took until he separated from him.

913
00:52:39.511 --> 00:52:43.070
It started having some milestones of his own graduating high school,

914
00:52:43.071 --> 00:52:46.670
graduating college,
getting a degree,
following love,
having a relationship,

915
00:52:46.671 --> 00:52:48.890
going into business that he started becoming a man,

916
00:52:49.250 --> 00:52:53.060
but he had a break away from this bitch mold that he grew up in.
Well,

917
00:52:53.061 --> 00:52:56.600
I think again,
parenting is also a very difficult situation,
right?

918
00:52:56.610 --> 00:52:59.780
He was just thrown into parenting and there is no book real.

919
00:52:59.781 --> 00:53:01.520
I mean there are books,
but you know,

920
00:53:01.521 --> 00:53:03.650
still a lot of times people are just thrown into it.

921
00:53:03.770 --> 00:53:06.920
There is no skill of how to raise my child or how to teach.

922
00:53:07.010 --> 00:53:09.680
You learn that from your own parents and your own parents and you're,

923
00:53:09.681 --> 00:53:12.230
you know what I mean?
It's,
it's like this long.
I was lucky.

924
00:53:12.231 --> 00:53:16.070
My Dad actually has very,
really hardcore,
he wasn't professional athlete,

925
00:53:16.130 --> 00:53:20.210
he was very focused.
He was very much like that old school kind of guy,

926
00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:24.080
but I think it actually helped me to become a really good man because I really

927
00:53:24.081 --> 00:53:26.230
learned how to focus and be the person that I wanted

928
00:53:26.260 --> 00:53:29.400
<v 3>to be from that.
Sure,
of course it does.
I mean,
that's exactly what we're saying.</v>

929
00:53:29.401 --> 00:53:30.400
If you want to be a man,

930
00:53:30.420 --> 00:53:33.470
you follow someone who was a man and he wanted to be a man.
Totally.
I mean it's,

931
00:53:33.471 --> 00:53:34.920
it's a perfect example.

932
00:53:35.130 --> 00:53:39.930
It's really difficult because a life you did not start out in a neutral point.

933
00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:44.520
No one starts out at zero.
Right.
Some of US started at minus 30 other of us.

934
00:53:44.580 --> 00:53:48.600
Some of US start out at plus 100 and sometimes the plus 100 people are fucked

935
00:53:48.780 --> 00:53:50.460
because everything's too God damn easy,
right?

936
00:53:50.650 --> 00:53:53.130
The minus 30 people and not telling me my,

937
00:53:53.220 --> 00:53:57.420
I was probably like minus five minus 30 people that come from a dark background

938
00:53:57.450 --> 00:54:00.750
a lot of times have this massive amount of expression inside of them because of

939
00:54:00.751 --> 00:54:05.040
that.
And if they can sort it out,
it's almost like they have more horsepower,

940
00:54:05.340 --> 00:54:06.850
you know,
their passion like,

941
00:54:06.900 --> 00:54:11.760
like some of the great artists as far as music that tortured background,

942
00:54:11.761 --> 00:54:14.190
tortured childhoods and you know,

943
00:54:14.191 --> 00:54:17.400
it allows them to express themselves and this intense,

944
00:54:17.550 --> 00:54:22.190
powerful way that someone who grew up in bel air isn't capable of doing exactly

945
00:54:22.230 --> 00:54:27.090
like when you remember that Song Friday five remember that?
None of that shit.

946
00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:30.810
The reason why people are so mad at that it was because they knew that this

947
00:54:30.811 --> 00:54:34.080
bitch hadn't suffered at all.
Like you're not allowed to sing.

948
00:54:34.290 --> 00:54:38.890
You know when you listened to like you listen to some old school blues and

949
00:54:38.940 --> 00:54:43.530
Robert Johnson,
he listened at you like this motherfucker was hot.

950
00:54:43.560 --> 00:54:47.730
They didn't have air conditioning.
They were sitting out there on the porch.

951
00:54:47.970 --> 00:54:50.490
He was constantly and persecuted by white people.

952
00:54:50.580 --> 00:54:53.910
He was women were trying to have his babies trying to get the fuck out of town

953
00:54:53.911 --> 00:54:58.860
and stay on the road like you felt everything in that guy's voice.

954
00:54:59.100 --> 00:55:03.810
That's the appeal of blues and the first close I live in New Orleans isn't that

955
00:55:03.811 --> 00:55:04.500
fucked.

956
00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:08.100
It's almost like you have to like have a shit childhood to become an interesting

957
00:55:08.101 --> 00:55:11.760
person.
Well I didn't have a shit childhood.
I had a shit middle part of my life,

958
00:55:11.761 --> 00:55:13.020
which actually did help me.

959
00:55:13.050 --> 00:55:16.320
I always look at that part and I always remember being homeless,

960
00:55:16.530 --> 00:55:18.450
doing prostitution on the streets,

961
00:55:18.630 --> 00:55:23.040
like all of that really made me be the person as well.
What time did that start?

962
00:55:23.340 --> 00:55:25.980
That was like later,
like in my mid twenties you know,

963
00:55:25.981 --> 00:55:30.150
I was a professional model at one time as a woman and I traveled around Europe

964
00:55:30.151 --> 00:55:33.000
and then I just couldn't do it anymore because I was doing it so much cocaine

965
00:55:33.690 --> 00:55:38.040
and drinking and partying like mad.
They were like crazy mad and I just crashed.

966
00:55:38.460 --> 00:55:42.570
Do you said though that when you were just getting your period and you were

967
00:55:42.571 --> 00:55:44.880
young,
that's when people started giving you a hard time.

968
00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:47.850
That wasn't a bad time in your life though.
Well yeah,

969
00:55:47.851 --> 00:55:49.920
I was in high school still and so then,
you know,

970
00:55:49.921 --> 00:55:53.220
I started having to deal with the high school thing and like,
you know a girl,

971
00:55:53.250 --> 00:55:58.020
I'm becoming a wall,
a girl and I didn't and I'm attracted to girls,

972
00:55:58.290 --> 00:56:03.060
you know,
and I was a lesbian,
I gas,
but I felt like a guy and this was,

973
00:56:03.061 --> 00:56:03.361
you know,

974
00:56:03.361 --> 00:56:08.340
30 or so more years ago and they didn't even talk about that kind of stuff when

975
00:56:08.341 --> 00:56:12.150
I was going to high school.
So a lot of stuff was going on for me.

976
00:56:12.151 --> 00:56:14.400
I started smoking weed.
Not that that's a bad thing,

977
00:56:14.401 --> 00:56:18.210
but when you're not focused and you start doing those kinds of things and just

978
00:56:18.211 --> 00:56:21.010
continues to escalate to hardcore drinky.

979
00:56:21.180 --> 00:56:24.100
Then the cocaine and everything just escalating for

980
00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:28.990
<v 6>me and I got totally out of control for like since 16 to like maybe 28 I was</v>

981
00:56:28.991 --> 00:56:32.930
completely out of control when you were self medicating completely to it.

982
00:56:33.020 --> 00:56:35.960
Those are the big difference right between that and enjoy it.

983
00:56:35.961 --> 00:56:39.790
A little whiskey amongst friends.
Lately I'm totally cool with all of that.

984
00:56:39.791 --> 00:56:43.450
Like I don't drank,
but for me it's just that I don't drink.

985
00:56:43.860 --> 00:56:47.020
Not that I'm sober or do that,
I just don't rank it right.
It doesn't work for me.

986
00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:49.800
It doesn't work for them.
There's nothing wrong with that either.
Right.

987
00:56:50.050 --> 00:56:52.720
The that thing though about self medicating,

988
00:56:52.721 --> 00:56:56.710
so common amongst kids that don't feel comfortable with who they are.

989
00:56:57.480 --> 00:57:01.030
They just decided to just plunge themselves into a bottle or and to,

990
00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:06.120
it's sad he'll bottle or because we also reinforce that and you'd society

991
00:57:06.251 --> 00:57:07.930
saying,
yeah,
you're right.
You can't be gay.

992
00:57:07.930 --> 00:57:11.980
It's completely not okay or it's weird that you feel like a girl or it's a weird

993
00:57:11.981 --> 00:57:12.910
that you feel like a boy,

994
00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:16.870
so we as a society reinforced those negative feelings constantly.

995
00:57:17.050 --> 00:57:20.830
You're just feel shitty about yourself and you're like,
there is no out for me.

996
00:57:20.930 --> 00:57:24.220
There is no out.
What am I going to do?
I cannot live as a woman anymore.

997
00:57:24.270 --> 00:57:26.260
This is the next option is to kill myself.

998
00:57:26.290 --> 00:57:30.580
That's why so many kids try to commit suicide now because they just feel no way

999
00:57:30.581 --> 00:57:31.690
out of this situation.

1000
00:57:31.810 --> 00:57:36.810
You felt like you needed to add hormones to your life in order to complete your

1001
00:57:37.301 --> 00:57:40.150
vision of who you are.
I didn't even know I could do that.

1002
00:57:40.151 --> 00:57:43.660
I have my change over 21 years ago when there was no internet really,

1003
00:57:43.661 --> 00:57:45.010
there was no doctors.
Ma.

1004
00:57:45.100 --> 00:57:48.850
I was the first trans man doctor in Los Angeles.

1005
00:57:48.850 --> 00:57:52.750
He never even met a guy like me before.
Same with my top,
my chest surgery,

1006
00:57:52.751 --> 00:57:54.610
all of that.
These guys were like,
oh,
okay,

1007
00:57:54.611 --> 00:57:57.940
but you're basically going to be our Guinea pig.
I mean,
it didn't even exist,

1008
00:57:58.180 --> 00:58:00.160
but I knew I needed to change.

1009
00:58:00.460 --> 00:58:04.690
And so I was willing to take that always in the back of my head is if it didn't

1010
00:58:04.691 --> 00:58:08.290
work,
I'm just going to kill myself.
I mean,
really think about how crazy that is.

1011
00:58:08.291 --> 00:58:11.530
That was always my option.
I'm going to try this.
If it doesn't work,

1012
00:58:11.740 --> 00:58:14.800
I'm just going to kill myself because that's how life threatening it was.

1013
00:58:14.860 --> 00:58:17.140
It was like I had to do it.
It was life or death for me.

1014
00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:21.710
And this was something that built up over time or was this totally,
yeah.

1015
00:58:21.810 --> 00:58:24.280
So you had reached a point when you were in your 20s when you were out of

1016
00:58:24.281 --> 00:58:28.440
control and partying and drinking.
You were trying to avoid yourself play.

1017
00:58:28.690 --> 00:58:31.450
And then once you finally face yourself,
you're like,
okay,

1018
00:58:31.510 --> 00:58:36.390
I either have to do something about this or let's see what's done or I'm done,

1019
00:58:36.560 --> 00:58:39.970
I'm done.
I can't continue to have people confront me as a woman.
You know,

1020
00:58:39.971 --> 00:58:42.970
she and I was like,
ha,
I was like a dyke,
you know,
like,
you know,

1021
00:58:42.971 --> 00:58:47.320
short hair and then people,
you know,
say Shit,
throw stuff at me on the street.

1022
00:58:47.321 --> 00:58:49.060
Yeah.
DYC We're going to kick your ass.

1023
00:58:49.061 --> 00:58:52.930
Like people used to follow me and try to fight.
I was a total fight or date,

1024
00:58:53.110 --> 00:58:57.010
but you know,
like that was my life and it was like,
you get tired of that.

1025
00:58:57.250 --> 00:59:01.810
You get really tired of constantly having to fight people's negativity towards

1026
00:59:01.811 --> 00:59:04.780
you constantly and you're like,
I don't want to be this way anymore.

1027
00:59:04.840 --> 00:59:08.950
Was it men that would,
would Matt,
aggressive man,
man or woman?

1028
00:59:08.980 --> 00:59:13.900
Never women always men following me,
throwing shit at me,
trying to fight me.

1029
00:59:13.901 --> 00:59:17.800
Like,
you know,
jumping me three or four guys jumping me,
like to say,

1030
00:59:17.830 --> 00:59:21.130
I don't know where it did.
Where was this at?
La,
West Hollywood,

1031
00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:21.990
those kinds of things like

1032
00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:26.480
<v 3>gay bashing basically.
I didn't know that women face it that often.
Oh totally.</v>

1033
00:59:26.481 --> 00:59:29.210
Especially when you look like a little boy,
but they can tell you're a girl.

1034
00:59:29.450 --> 00:59:32.660
You know what I mean?
It was like,
yeah,
it was a nightmare for me.
I was like,

1035
00:59:32.690 --> 00:59:36.200
I'm really lucky to be where I am today because really I should be dead,

1036
00:59:36.650 --> 00:59:40.700
so I really should be dead and so many aspects of my life I should just not be

1037
00:59:40.701 --> 00:59:41.534
here.

1038
00:59:41.570 --> 00:59:46.570
So you went to a doctor and you had this idea in your head like,

1039
00:59:47.511 --> 00:59:50.060
look,
there's gotta be a way.
Yeah,
totally.

1040
00:59:50.061 --> 00:59:53.060
I had seen a documentary with a woman who changed to a man.

1041
00:59:53.300 --> 00:59:54.830
It was from Europe or something.
And I'm like,

1042
00:59:55.070 --> 00:59:57.740
how come nobody told me this is possible?

1043
00:59:57.920 --> 01:00:01.920
Like nobody even therapists or psychologist or psychiatrist.

1044
01:00:01.921 --> 01:00:06.320
When I went to tell her I psychiatrist,
I feel like a man and she was like,
well,

1045
01:00:06.410 --> 01:00:10.370
you're just a very male identified female.
But the fuck is that.

1046
01:00:11.170 --> 01:00:12.230
I feel like a man.

1047
01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:15.470
She didn't even have the lingo to like come back at me and like,

1048
01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:17.990
you know what Buck,
you can have a sex change.

1049
01:00:17.991 --> 01:00:21.050
Like never did anybody say that to me.
So how do you find,

1050
01:00:21.051 --> 01:00:25.520
like if someone doesn't gender identify with being a male and there,

1051
01:00:25.820 --> 01:00:27.800
you know what,
what,
what do you do?

1052
01:00:27.950 --> 01:00:30.320
Say if you're a man and you want to become a woman around when you want to

1053
01:00:30.321 --> 01:00:33.520
become a man,
what's the steps?
You fucking Google it right now.

1054
01:00:34.730 --> 01:00:38.690
Then I had to go to a bookstore and find this old book and find a doctor in the

1055
01:00:38.691 --> 01:00:42.740
back that was like for transgender,
for women,
for men becoming women.

1056
01:00:42.741 --> 01:00:46.060
They didn't even have anything for guys like me.
And I found this book.
I mean,

1057
01:00:46.061 --> 01:00:48.290
I was like determined to figure out how to do this.

1058
01:00:48.290 --> 01:00:51.110
And I called this doctor and Hollywood here and he's like,
well,

1059
01:00:51.111 --> 01:00:54.440
I never worked with a woman who wants to become a man,
but why don't you come in?

1060
01:00:54.441 --> 01:00:58.280
And he saved my life and he's like,
all you'll be my Guinea pig.
We'll figure out.

1061
01:00:58.310 --> 01:01:03.020
That's fascinating that there were so many women that came women from men,

1062
01:01:03.021 --> 01:01:07.190
but that became men who were women.
Yeah.
It's,
it's a new movement now.

1063
01:01:07.191 --> 01:01:11.350
There's a lot more happening.
But uh,
did you kickstart it?
Nah,

1064
01:01:11.420 --> 01:01:15.160
it's been happening.
But I think I did kind of take a little credit that,

1065
01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:19.130
um,
so you went to this doctor and then,

1066
01:01:19.220 --> 01:01:21.560
so he says you're going to be his Guinea pig.
Yup.

1067
01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:26.620
And how does he starts to say he starts giving me very small doses of

1068
01:01:26.931 --> 01:01:30.340
testosterone.
Very,
you would laugh like teeny weeny.
Right?

1069
01:01:30.740 --> 01:01:33.400
And then he just fought,
checks me out,
make sure everything's gold.

1070
01:01:33.410 --> 01:01:37.010
Within six months he has me up to one CC of testosterone,

1071
01:01:37.100 --> 01:01:41.960
teaches me how to inject it myself and sees a whole cc cc and a week every two

1072
01:01:41.961 --> 01:01:46.460
weeks.
Jesus Christ.
That's a lot.
You think so?
Yeah.
And then we just,

1073
01:01:46.461 --> 01:01:47.420
six months later he's like,

1074
01:01:47.421 --> 01:01:50.630
I want to teach you how to do it yourself so that you can go on with your life.

1075
01:01:50.690 --> 01:01:54.520
And you know what an amazing man relay.
It was amazing.

1076
01:01:54.710 --> 01:01:58.730
He taught me and then I went on and it was like,
I was like reborn.

1077
01:01:58.910 --> 01:01:59.870
I was reborn.

1078
01:01:59.871 --> 01:02:04.130
It like literally like physically and mentally changed my life.

1079
01:02:04.131 --> 01:02:07.730
Do you get testosterone in Mexico?
Yes.
No.

1080
01:02:07.731 --> 01:02:12.320
Do you worry that it might be bullshit?
No,
no.
It's fucking oil.
Fuck no dude,

1081
01:02:12.321 --> 01:02:12.890
it's real.

1082
01:02:12.890 --> 01:02:17.660
I used to sustain on right now so you like cause Mexican pharmaceutical drugs.

1083
01:02:17.670 --> 01:02:20.050
You can basically get whatever the fuck you want to I have or you

1084
01:02:20.060 --> 01:02:24.780
<v 5>want.
That's kind of cool.
Happy about the way Mexico like the,
the,</v>

1085
01:02:24.781 --> 01:02:28.140
the drug wars chaos and it's,
it's really sad.

1086
01:02:28.141 --> 01:02:31.350
You see all the violence over there and it's very depressing.
However,

1087
01:02:31.530 --> 01:02:34.830
there's a certain amount of freedom that comes to having a shit government

1088
01:02:35.050 --> 01:02:39.450
fairly in control of its populous.
They're getting their shit together dude.

1089
01:02:39.451 --> 01:02:42.660
But he was call the pharmacy and then they deliver it to your house for free.

1090
01:02:42.690 --> 01:02:45.840
They deliver it
like,
you know,

1091
01:02:47.450 --> 01:02:50.730
self medicate the fuck you want.
21 years into it.

1092
01:02:50.731 --> 01:02:54.180
I completely know what I'm doing now.
It's not the night.
That's fascinating.

1093
01:02:54.770 --> 01:02:58.470
And I inject myself and my life just started to change and then I decided I

1094
01:02:58.471 --> 01:03:01.590
needed to get my breasts removed even though they weren't big.

1095
01:03:01.770 --> 01:03:03.060
I needed to have a male chest.

1096
01:03:03.061 --> 01:03:06.240
I mean that was always my ultimate thing is to be able to take my shirt off.

1097
01:03:06.270 --> 01:03:07.590
I mean,
that's like such a guy thing.

1098
01:03:07.690 --> 01:03:10.860
Hung around with your shirt off and I found a doctor who had never worked with a

1099
01:03:10.861 --> 01:03:12.480
guy like me and he did it.
Yeah.

1100
01:03:12.481 --> 01:03:16.500
I thought that was fascinating about Chaz Bono is that there was photographs of

1101
01:03:16.501 --> 01:03:21.501
Chaz walking on the beach after she became Chaz and he has these big scars under

1102
01:03:24.001 --> 01:03:24.834
his breasts,

1103
01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:30.020
but because of the fact that now he identifies as a man in regular publications,

1104
01:03:30.601 --> 01:03:32.920
they're showing him topless and I'm like,
good.

1105
01:03:32.921 --> 01:03:37.350
That was really interesting because you really can't have a problem with it.

1106
01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:40.830
But if he was still a woman before the sex change,

1107
01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:44.550
then it would be a real issue.
The same nipple,
I know it.

1108
01:03:44.551 --> 01:03:46.680
You're right on to it shows you how fucking stupid dude.

1109
01:03:47.180 --> 01:03:51.750
Totally chest.
Well,
it's also,

1110
01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:57.080
the Internet has really flipped the script on what we're used to seeing,

1111
01:03:57.511 --> 01:03:59.850
what we can see,
what we can accept.

1112
01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:03.810
I had never seen a man that had become a woman until you,

1113
01:04:04.050 --> 01:04:05.520
so on my message board,

1114
01:04:05.521 --> 01:04:09.660
I have a message board filled with freaks and savage and they fucking,

1115
01:04:09.661 --> 01:04:12.340
they knew about you back in the nine horse.
My,

1116
01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:15.710
my website's been around since [inaudible] 98.
I mean,
I don't know when,
uh,

1117
01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:20.430
I was introduced to you on the website years and years ago,
but that you are a,

1118
01:04:20.431 --> 01:04:21.390
just a,

1119
01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:26.610
like a new piece in this new vision of the world.

1120
01:04:26.910 --> 01:04:27.331
You know,

1121
01:04:27.331 --> 01:04:31.470
there's new thing that exists that didn't exist with father knows best was on

1122
01:04:31.471 --> 01:04:35.400
the air and you know,
the twilight zone was shocking.
You know what I mean?

1123
01:04:35.401 --> 01:04:38.590
It's everything now is,
there's the,

1124
01:04:38.591 --> 01:04:41.990
the amount of information is so much larger this,

1125
01:04:42.330 --> 01:04:44.100
the scope of the canvas,

1126
01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:49.050
the size of the canvas of reality is so much larger and you're a part of that.

1127
01:04:49.051 --> 01:04:50.960
You're,
you're a part of that.
I think so.
It will be,

1128
01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:53.910
because really what it comes down to is my genitals.

1129
01:04:53.911 --> 01:04:57.690
And when I went to the world and said,
you know what,

1130
01:04:57.720 --> 01:05:01.050
I don't need to have a penis to be a man.
I just went to the world and said,

1131
01:05:01.051 --> 01:05:05.370
fuck you,
I did well,
this is a really interesting photo of you.

1132
01:05:05.430 --> 01:05:06.960
That's all my message board on this.

1133
01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:09.080
There's a thread that someone put up about this,
uh,

1134
01:05:09.180 --> 01:05:13.080
particular conversation and it's you like lounging back completely naked,

1135
01:05:13.081 --> 01:05:18.040
smoking a cigar and it's like for half your body,
it's like the manliest shit

1136
01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:23.100
<v 3>possible is yoked up dude smoking a cigar with a beard covering tattoos and</v>

1137
01:05:24.010 --> 01:05:28.510
there's a vagina.
It's like,
right.
It's like,
whoa.
Yeah.
The,
your,

1138
01:05:28.511 --> 01:05:31.090
your identity,
you know,
the,
the of,
you know,

1139
01:05:31.100 --> 01:05:35.860
your idea of what a man is like is immediately challenged and it's always like,

1140
01:05:35.950 --> 01:05:37.310
how do you feel about this?
Cause what,

1141
01:05:37.311 --> 01:05:41.860
what exactly you're seeing here and what is this?
What,
what bothers you?

1142
01:05:41.890 --> 01:05:45.760
Does it,
is this change your view of reality?
You know,
it's awesome.

1143
01:05:45.930 --> 01:05:50.350
Mean I really feel honored to be able to do that to the world and it's an honor

1144
01:05:50.351 --> 01:05:54.370
and a wide shot to really push the thought of what,

1145
01:05:54.970 --> 01:05:59.400
what is this?
What is male and female and gay and straight?
What is,

1146
01:05:59.620 --> 01:06:03.640
what is,
what are you and what are the problems?
Why,

1147
01:06:03.641 --> 01:06:07.420
why do they exist?
Do they exist because someone is threatening you?

1148
01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:09.790
Do they exist because you're threatened by it?

1149
01:06:10.870 --> 01:06:12.820
What exactly is the issue?

1150
01:06:12.910 --> 01:06:16.540
What is your cause now you have to look at yourself because you before looked at

1151
01:06:16.541 --> 01:06:20.320
me like a man and all of a sudden you'll see my vagina and you're like,
ah,
holy.

1152
01:06:20.470 --> 01:06:24.650
And mostly it's males that do that because you know,
men are pretty,
uh,

1153
01:06:24.790 --> 01:06:29.380
pretty attached to their penis.
I mean,
you know that.
Understandably so.
But that,

1154
01:06:29.381 --> 01:06:32.980
that's just so now I'm saying to you,
you don't have to have that to be a man.

1155
01:06:32.981 --> 01:06:36.820
It's really challenging your own identity in a way.
Yeah.
It gets,

1156
01:06:36.910 --> 01:06:41.320
it gets slippery.
But it's,
so though the slippery thing is not even that,
oh,

1157
01:06:41.321 --> 01:06:46.090
that's a man too.
It's like what,
what is the controversy like?

1158
01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:50.320
Not that he's unusual,
not that he's unique,
but what bothers people?

1159
01:06:50.350 --> 01:06:51.830
What gets them angry?
What does

1160
01:06:53.380 --> 01:06:56.200
angry mass gets so much to kill me.

1161
01:06:57.040 --> 01:07:00.880
I have to like have security sometimes when I go speak because people all,
yeah,

1162
01:07:00.881 --> 01:07:02.440
they're telling me they're gonna kill me if I show up.

1163
01:07:02.590 --> 01:07:07.150
What kind of people can you imagine?
What kind of people?
For example,

1164
01:07:07.180 --> 01:07:10.600
Yale University,
Yale University,

1165
01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:15.130
they were going to find,
they were saying,
if you show up here,
we will kill you.

1166
01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:20.170
Who said that?
Students.
Students and alumni.
And of course I had to report it.

1167
01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:23.410
I mean I,
I didn't want to be like that bitch.
Right.
I was like,

1168
01:07:23.411 --> 01:07:26.590
bring it on and then you know,
people are like,
you better chill out dude.

1169
01:07:26.620 --> 01:07:28.240
You don't know,
they might be there.

1170
01:07:28.510 --> 01:07:31.420
So I had to report it to the people who brought me in and uh,

1171
01:07:31.450 --> 01:07:33.520
they had 24 hour security the whole time I was there.

1172
01:07:33.550 --> 01:07:38.200
We always have to be worried about the one fucking wing.
You never know.

1173
01:07:38.230 --> 01:07:41.980
You never know.
That's the broad spectrum.
But I deal with that all the time.

1174
01:07:42.010 --> 01:07:43.720
I don't deal with it as much as I used to.

1175
01:07:43.721 --> 01:07:47.140
I have to tell you that people have become much more understanding and much more

1176
01:07:47.141 --> 01:07:50.620
supportive.
My fan base has grown tremendously in the last,

1177
01:07:50.621 --> 01:07:54.550
I would say five years.
Just crazy.
What do you attribute that to?
A,

1178
01:07:54.551 --> 01:07:58.510
I think listening to me and seeing that I'm just like a normal guy.

1179
01:07:58.570 --> 01:08:02.110
It's not really a big deal and telling you how amazing my life is and then I'm a

1180
01:08:02.111 --> 01:08:05.800
positive person and that all I want really is for people to be able to be

1181
01:08:05.801 --> 01:08:07.600
themselves,
whatever that means.

1182
01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:11.330
Do you think that it reflects a change in society as a whole?
Uh,

1183
01:08:11.350 --> 01:08:12.680
clearly it has to be.
I mean,

1184
01:08:12.700 --> 01:08:16.280
people are opening up their minds and understanding that,
yeah,
you know it,

1185
01:08:16.370 --> 01:08:21.130
<v 5>this person has happy,
so why am I angry about it?
Right.
I face it.</v>

1186
01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:26.760
The progressive ideas are way more mainstream than they've ever been in way

1187
01:08:27.741 --> 01:08:30.830
more.
And I think it's because of the Internet,
because the open dialogue,

1188
01:08:30.831 --> 01:08:32.870
the Internet presents like you realize like you know,

1189
01:08:32.900 --> 01:08:34.400
there's a lot of these people,
they don't,

1190
01:08:34.430 --> 01:08:37.610
they're not really much different than you or I this,
they're,

1191
01:08:37.620 --> 01:08:40.880
they're just like you or I,
they're not evil.
There's nothing wrong with them.

1192
01:08:40.881 --> 01:08:45.110
They're just there as a different thing.
There this you're that,
you know,

1193
01:08:45.111 --> 01:08:47.180
they liked this kind of music.
You think it sucks,

1194
01:08:47.181 --> 01:08:48.740
but you liked that kind of music and then,

1195
01:08:48.741 --> 01:08:51.240
but there's so many commonalities that we,
eh,

1196
01:08:51.350 --> 01:08:54.920
sort of inform each other of because the internet,
you kind of go,

1197
01:08:54.921 --> 01:08:59.360
well wait a minute,
what's our real problem here?
Like is it sexuality,

1198
01:08:59.361 --> 01:09:03.650
is it gender identification or we just distracting ourselves with this nonsense.

1199
01:09:03.710 --> 01:09:06.350
Well that's a very specific kind of person now because as you know,

1200
01:09:06.351 --> 01:09:10.010
I mean the Internet is full of trolls for days and those ones really are the

1201
01:09:10.011 --> 01:09:14.210
ones who react and do huge neck and continue to make it very negative on the

1202
01:09:14.211 --> 01:09:15.590
Internet.
Yeah.
You know what I mean?

1203
01:09:15.591 --> 01:09:18.170
So of course we have the people like you and your fans and the people are

1204
01:09:18.171 --> 01:09:20.480
willing to listen and,
and talk about these kinds of things.

1205
01:09:20.481 --> 01:09:25.481
But then we have the other side that's so incredibly hateful and never wants

1206
01:09:25.881 --> 01:09:28.930
this kind of thing to be accepted in the world.
Yeah.

1207
01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:34.000
The trolls issue is a fascinating one because really all it is is unhappy

1208
01:09:35.721 --> 01:09:36.290
people.

1209
01:09:36.290 --> 01:09:41.290
It's a huge sea of unhappy people saying shitty mean things.

1210
01:09:41.570 --> 01:09:44.540
Oh,
they're crazy.
They're crazy.
Those are the ones that say,

1211
01:09:44.541 --> 01:09:46.760
I'm going to kill you.
You of course you have no life.
Well,

1212
01:09:46.761 --> 01:09:48.560
they're sitting at home molten and again,

1213
01:09:48.561 --> 01:09:52.340
most of them don't mean a word they're saying,
oh no,
I always say that.
Totally.

1214
01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:56.310
But there's a few that might,
there's a few broken ones telling Ya.
You know,

1215
01:09:56.350 --> 01:09:59.660
and you,
you have to protect yourself in those situations.

1216
01:10:00.290 --> 01:10:04.850
You have winglets after you,
you must have a friendly guy,
easy to get along with,

1217
01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:08.300
but you are,
but so am I.
It's like a giant vagina.

1218
01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:11.470
They don't even know what I have.

1219
01:10:11.471 --> 01:10:15.770
I might have been faking the funk the whole time.
Who knows?

1220
01:10:16.460 --> 01:10:20.920
Um,
I think that the angry thing is also,
um,

1221
01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:25.010
because of the lack of real interaction because of the fact they were able to do

1222
01:10:25.011 --> 01:10:29.150
it over the Internet.
There's no,
there's no like social repercussions.

1223
01:10:29.660 --> 01:10:30.680
When you look at someone,

1224
01:10:30.681 --> 01:10:33.020
you say something mean like you have to be a psychopath.

1225
01:10:33.260 --> 01:10:35.180
If someone's never done anything to you and you look at them,

1226
01:10:35.181 --> 01:10:37.430
you say something mean and you see them react and you see,

1227
01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:40.700
you see it hurt their feelings.
It doesn't bother you,
you,
you,

1228
01:10:40.701 --> 01:10:43.130
you're broken person,
you're associated with it.
There's something wrong with you,

1229
01:10:43.410 --> 01:10:45.990
but when you do it on the Internet it's like you can just like,

1230
01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:49.550
oh just say something shitty and cause you're removed from us.

1231
01:10:49.580 --> 01:10:51.980
You're completely removed from it.
The lack of,

1232
01:10:52.370 --> 01:10:53.900
but I think that this is temporary.

1233
01:10:53.901 --> 01:10:58.730
I really think this is like this crazy chaos before the age of enlightenment.

1234
01:10:58.780 --> 01:10:59.181
I'm and I'm,

1235
01:10:59.181 --> 01:11:04.181
and I'm a big believer in progress and I'm a big believer in utopia,

1236
01:11:05.251 --> 01:11:08.420
utopia and ideas and to the point where it's unrealistic,

1237
01:11:08.690 --> 01:11:12.950
like I have some pretty unrealistic views of the possibilities of humanity that

1238
01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:14.010
those are important for use to

1239
01:11:14.010 --> 01:11:16.770
<v 6>have because I'm very much the same way.
I believe that if we have,</v>

1240
01:11:16.990 --> 01:11:21.090
I am a believer of energies.
First off,
if I give off positive energy,

1241
01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:25.320
I always get positive energy back.
I agree.
I think that's huge.
If you give,

1242
01:11:25.430 --> 01:11:30.430
if I came into this room right now with the attitude that was not like cool and

1243
01:11:30.741 --> 01:11:33.060
I was just sitting here waiting for you to talk shit to me,

1244
01:11:33.700 --> 01:11:38.220
me and you are going to have not as good as a situation going on between us.

1245
01:11:38.221 --> 01:11:39.970
I don't think right now I think it would be my,

1246
01:11:40.260 --> 01:11:43.890
but because I'm coming in with that energy,
that negative,

1247
01:11:44.010 --> 01:11:46.170
go ahead and say it to me dude energy,
right?

1248
01:11:46.171 --> 01:11:50.430
Which a lot of people in my situation tend to have because they don't understand

1249
01:11:50.610 --> 01:11:54.330
that you have to under people do not understand us.
And when I come,

1250
01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:57.180
when I come to explain to you the situation,

1251
01:11:57.181 --> 01:12:00.720
I have to understand that you don't get it and you already have a preconceived

1252
01:12:00.721 --> 01:12:04.050
notion about it and you're already judging me and that's okay.

1253
01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:05.610
It's because you don't get it.

1254
01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:09.600
So I have to come to it with an understanding of that and understanding that I

1255
01:12:09.601 --> 01:12:14.601
need to now teach you and the best way to teach somebody is to be happy about it

1256
01:12:14.730 --> 01:12:18.660
and to let you have your feelings and then hopefully I can win you over with the

1257
01:12:18.661 --> 01:12:23.130
fact that I'm just a happy dude and it's not right.
And you can say things to me.

1258
01:12:23.131 --> 01:12:26.580
It doesn't hurt me because it's you don't understand.
Right.

1259
01:12:26.790 --> 01:12:30.150
That's fine.
You're not going to change who you are with their words,

1260
01:12:30.180 --> 01:12:33.400
but if I'm angry at you and you're calling me like a freak or do,

1261
01:12:33.401 --> 01:12:36.360
that's totally freaky and weird.
No,
I understand that.

1262
01:12:36.361 --> 01:12:39.540
You think it's freaking weird cause it Kinda is freaky and weird,
right?

1263
01:12:39.750 --> 01:12:42.540
I totally get it.
I'm not,
I'm not totally out of bounds with that.

1264
01:12:42.541 --> 01:12:45.660
I completely understand that the man with a pussy is kind of weird and funny.

1265
01:12:47.170 --> 01:12:50.680
<v 4>Well you know the anger thing where people want to kill you and then the troll</v>

1266
01:12:50.681 --> 01:12:55.450
thing,
whether they're hating and I think all that is just misused potential.

1267
01:12:55.510 --> 01:13:00.190
That's what I think.
I think the human mind is incredibly complex.

1268
01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:03.550
But it doesn't come with an instruction manual.

1269
01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:05.440
It doesn't come with you.

1270
01:13:05.441 --> 01:13:10.270
Imagine if the human body was a vehicle that you had to learn how to use and how

1271
01:13:10.271 --> 01:13:11.470
long you'd have to go to school for.

1272
01:13:11.471 --> 01:13:15.190
They would give you a license to operate a human body.
I mean Jesus Christ,

1273
01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:17.950
if you were an an an inferior being,

1274
01:13:17.951 --> 01:13:21.010
if you were something that existed in thought only,

1275
01:13:21.250 --> 01:13:24.910
and the only way to manifest yourself in the real world was get a license to use

1276
01:13:24.911 --> 01:13:29.400
a body.
You know,
if the,
the human body was just like,
like a car,
right?
You,

1277
01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:32.920
you would,
she's as Christ.
You'd have to learn a lot of shit.
I have to learn.

1278
01:13:32.950 --> 01:13:33.671
You'd have to like,

1279
01:13:33.671 --> 01:13:36.880
well we have to find out how you're going to interact with the other humans,

1280
01:13:36.881 --> 01:13:39.580
right?
So you got to understand cause and effect.

1281
01:13:39.730 --> 01:13:41.890
You got to understand action reaction.

1282
01:13:42.010 --> 01:13:45.160
You got to understand the powerful benefits of positive energy.

1283
01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:48.580
You got to understand love.
You've got to understand insecurity,
right?

1284
01:13:48.610 --> 01:13:49.870
You got to understand jealousy.

1285
01:13:49.871 --> 01:13:54.090
You got to understand all these waters that need to be navigated before we let

1286
01:13:54.100 --> 01:13:56.950
you in the stream of humanity.
Right?
And we don't,

1287
01:13:57.010 --> 01:14:00.760
we just fucking take these all this potential and just go get out of the fucking

1288
01:14:00.761 --> 01:14:03.160
house and we push them out into the river.

1289
01:14:04.170 --> 01:14:06.900
And I think that's why a lot of those self help books are

1290
01:14:06.910 --> 01:14:10.420
<v 6>people who teach those way of thinking are so huge.</v>

1291
01:14:10.660 --> 01:14:14.050
Because I think people want to learn to be like that really?

1292
01:14:14.210 --> 01:14:17.980
And the underlying part of it,
people want to learn how to be calm and happy.

1293
01:14:17.981 --> 01:14:21.470
And how does that person have that energy?
Yeah,
I do.
I get that.

1294
01:14:22.180 --> 01:14:26.010
<v 4>Um,
it's turned to be a big benefit of this podcast.</v>

1295
01:14:26.130 --> 01:14:31.020
That's one of the big benefits that people always cite is that they have a

1296
01:14:31.021 --> 01:14:34.920
chance to see a perspective other than the one they've been told is the one

1297
01:14:34.921 --> 01:14:37.680
that's supposed to follow.
Right?
And then all of a sudden they're like,
oh yeah,

1298
01:14:37.681 --> 01:14:42.000
like,
oh,
I don't have to be a dick.
Oh,
I can like take personal responsibility.

1299
01:14:42.001 --> 01:14:43.100
I can be nice to people.

1300
01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:46.440
I can look at this as some sort of a weird temporary situation.

1301
01:14:46.441 --> 01:14:51.441
And the best case scenario is you have as many friends and loved ones and you

1302
01:14:52.021 --> 01:14:54.960
share great moments during this time period that you're conscious

1303
01:14:55.300 --> 01:14:58.660
<v 6>and that's a huge thing that you're doing really because you're changing the way</v>

1304
01:14:58.810 --> 01:15:01.750
you're changing that way and that way people think.

1305
01:15:01.751 --> 01:15:06.190
And then those people go to other people and then they say the same thing.

1306
01:15:06.191 --> 01:15:10.900
So you're sorta like moving that positive energy along that totally line line of

1307
01:15:10.901 --> 01:15:11.280
people

1308
01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:11.911
<v 4>and it's,
yeah,</v>

1309
01:15:11.911 --> 01:15:16.830
and it's only positive possible for me because I've got those ideas and that

1310
01:15:16.831 --> 01:15:20.840
vibe and those,
those good thoughts from other people online.
Exactly.

1311
01:15:20.980 --> 01:15:24.420
And it spreads and you just got to learn what to focus on and what not to.

1312
01:15:24.421 --> 01:15:25.080
And if you,

1313
01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:27.840
if I wanted to go online and just pay attention to all the people who are

1314
01:15:27.841 --> 01:15:31.920
trolling,
I'd fucking run my head through a wall.
I would be,

1315
01:15:31.980 --> 01:15:35.310
if I only concentrated on them exactly everywhere.

1316
01:15:35.610 --> 01:15:38.790
If you have any sort of an internet presence whatsoever or say anything

1317
01:15:38.791 --> 01:15:40.200
controversial,
which I have both,

1318
01:15:40.470 --> 01:15:43.200
you're going to have a massive amount of people that want to just push your

1319
01:15:43.250 --> 01:15:46.830
buttons and just,
just pet potential.

1320
01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:50.790
They're just potential that is misused almost universally because there's some

1321
01:15:50.791 --> 01:15:54.660
people that disagree with me on a bunch of different ideas and there's tuts

1322
01:15:54.670 --> 01:15:59.130
totally cool.
And I mean,
and,
and I expect it,
of course,

1323
01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:03.750
and it's one of the things that I always make sure that the point that in most

1324
01:16:03.751 --> 01:16:07.620
situations there's not a right or wrong in most situations there's,

1325
01:16:07.621 --> 01:16:10.050
you think this,
and I may agree with you,

1326
01:16:10.051 --> 01:16:13.090
but I might disagree with you and neither one of us is right,
right.

1327
01:16:13.170 --> 01:16:16.020
It's just this is my perspective and this is your perspective.

1328
01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:17.970
And when people start approaching things like that,

1329
01:16:17.971 --> 01:16:21.130
then you can kind of learn from other people's points of view,
right?
And you go,

1330
01:16:21.131 --> 01:16:23.490
oh,
I see why he thinks it sucks because of this.

1331
01:16:23.670 --> 01:16:28.560
Or I see why he loves that because of that.
But the real problem is,

1332
01:16:28.590 --> 01:16:32.820
is when people want you to feel how they feel,
right?
They feel like shit.

1333
01:16:33.030 --> 01:16:37.500
They're hurting,
they,
they're hateful,
they're there,
they're just a mess.

1334
01:16:37.620 --> 01:16:42.620
And they just want to just throw up shit all over you and just turn your life.

1335
01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:44.760
And the same kind of shit that they have.

1336
01:16:44.830 --> 01:16:47.760
<v 6>No,
I totally get that.
And I get a lot of those haters toward,</v>

1337
01:16:47.820 --> 01:16:50.050
they turn my words around and they say,

1338
01:16:50.051 --> 01:16:53.830
Buck said this about trans women should do this call.
Never said that.

1339
01:16:53.860 --> 01:16:58.330
Read the interview.
But I had to learn how to block them because I did it.

1340
01:16:58.390 --> 01:17:02.500
I'll be honest,
I did take it personally at one time.
I totally like,
Ooh.

1341
01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:05.500
And then I was like,
okay,
well,
wait a minute.
It's not me.
It's not my agenda.

1342
01:17:05.501 --> 01:17:07.540
It's their agenda.
It's not about what I do.

1343
01:17:07.541 --> 01:17:10.220
And so then I just had to learn to remove

1344
01:17:10.220 --> 01:17:13.190
<v 5>myself from their situation.
I would say that people like that,</v>

1345
01:17:13.191 --> 01:17:14.120
or like snake venom,

1346
01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:17.840
you get a little bit of in your system and then you get immune and then when the

1347
01:17:17.841 --> 01:17:21.140
snake bites so you don't die right.
You know,
you go,
oh,
I know what you're doing.

1348
01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:24.560
Exactly.
Snake poison.
He totally get it.
It's really just like that.

1349
01:17:25.250 --> 01:17:28.610
And it's both on the,
the side of the assholes,

1350
01:17:28.611 --> 01:17:30.230
but also on the side of the progressive's.

1351
01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:33.900
I see progressive's going after each other with snake venom,
you know,

1352
01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:37.820
accusing each other of crazy cause like you said before,
it's that you're at,

1353
01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:41.000
you want to put your agenda on someone else and they have to,

1354
01:17:41.001 --> 01:17:43.520
if they don't get it and if they are not onboard with you,

1355
01:17:43.670 --> 01:17:44.780
then they're the bad person.

1356
01:17:45.230 --> 01:17:47.600
I don't understand people who don't understand what you just said.

1357
01:17:47.601 --> 01:17:50.330
You have an opinion about it and I have an opinion about it and it's totally

1358
01:17:50.331 --> 01:17:50.540
cool.

1359
01:17:50.540 --> 01:17:54.800
I respect your opinion and you respect my opinion and then why can't we just

1360
01:17:54.860 --> 01:17:55.550
leave it at that?

1361
01:17:55.550 --> 01:17:59.450
There's a lot of people that use the vehicle of discourse to try to hurt other

1362
01:17:59.451 --> 01:18:03.410
people's opinions,
hurt other people's feelings and to score points.

1363
01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:07.430
They'll like shit on people to score for themselves.

1364
01:18:07.460 --> 01:18:12.110
And I see it a lot and I'm not talking about someone making fun or using humor

1365
01:18:12.111 --> 01:18:16.310
or like a Kanye west Jimmy Kimmel type situation,
which is totally warranted.

1366
01:18:16.580 --> 01:18:20.930
And I think Jimmy Kimmel's defense,
he's doing Kanye west of favor.

1367
01:18:21.180 --> 01:18:24.390
Like Kanye West needs to see how fucking ridiculous he looks.
Yeah.

1368
01:18:24.450 --> 01:18:27.010
Because he's not being cool about it.
He's,

1369
01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:31.400
he was being completely uncool and that interview and even less cool afterwards,

1370
01:18:31.580 --> 01:18:34.610
it reaffirmed why Jimmy Kimmel should have done exactly.

1371
01:18:34.700 --> 01:18:36.380
So I'm not talking about that,

1372
01:18:36.381 --> 01:18:40.940
but I get so disturbed when I go online and people who are,

1373
01:18:41.190 --> 01:18:43.700
whether they're feminists or whether they're skeptics,

1374
01:18:43.701 --> 01:18:47.900
are atheists attacking each other,
attacking people in the community,

1375
01:18:48.050 --> 01:18:52.670
like coming out with reasons why this person's a rapist because he had sex with

1376
01:18:52.671 --> 01:18:55.420
someone when they were drunk and everyone who does,
that's a rapist.

1377
01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:58.760
And they're also taking this weird moral high ground.
When they do that,

1378
01:18:58.761 --> 01:19:00.310
they're getting Brownie points,
right?

1379
01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:03.680
Getting Social Brownie points while they're doing it right.
And you see it,
it's,

1380
01:19:03.681 --> 01:19:07.970
it's,
it's transparent and disgusting and it works.
It works.

1381
01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:11.120
It totally works.
You see it,
you see them like people praising them.

1382
01:19:11.180 --> 01:19:16.070
Thank you so much for saying it's exactly why they do a little cheesy.

1383
01:19:16.071 --> 01:19:19.550
Myers is,
you know this whole thing with Michael Shermer?
No,
it's fascinating.

1384
01:19:19.551 --> 01:19:22.100
Shit.
He's accusing this guys is very famous skeptic.

1385
01:19:22.130 --> 01:19:24.830
Michael Shermer of not even rape.

1386
01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:28.640
The woman's saying that Michael Shermer put her in a position where she could

1387
01:19:28.641 --> 01:19:33.370
not have consent,
she could not consent.
And what was very ambiguous,
the,
the,
the,

1388
01:19:33.380 --> 01:19:37.850
the assumption is she was drunk because he uses as corroborating evidence

1389
01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:43.120
another woman's tale where she met him at a party and he made sure her glass was

1390
01:19:43.761 --> 01:19:47.480
always full and she got drunker than she normally does and she's literally using

1391
01:19:47.481 --> 01:19:51.140
this to corroborate what he said.
Meaning that he got her drunk,

1392
01:19:51.141 --> 01:19:54.860
like completely removing herself from any personal responsibility for actually

1393
01:19:54.861 --> 01:19:59.470
drinking and being an adult and getting drunk and somehow or another like

1394
01:19:59.630 --> 01:20:00.780
corroborating the,

1395
01:20:00.790 --> 01:20:04.910
the story of the other person that he got her into a position where she couldn't

1396
01:20:04.911 --> 01:20:07.040
consent.
It's weird sort of,

1397
01:20:07.110 --> 01:20:12.110
there's this weird sort of feminist skeptic language they use like these

1398
01:20:12.230 --> 01:20:16.710
privilege a lot.
Yeah.
That's the new,
the new language.
Dead privileges.

1399
01:20:16.711 --> 01:20:20.700
A weird one.
Right.
Privileges away.
When I had to really learn that,
oh,

1400
01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:24.750
I get checked on that all the time,
dude.
I'm a now a privileged white man.

1401
01:20:24.780 --> 01:20:28.260
You get checked on that.
All the male privilege,
white privilege,

1402
01:20:28.261 --> 01:20:31.470
white get checked on and they use it to diffuse your argument.
Oh yes.

1403
01:20:31.471 --> 01:20:34.640
They didn't use it to diffuse your viewpoint.
They use it to,
and it's,

1404
01:20:34.650 --> 01:20:37.470
it's this weird fucking,
so when they sang it,

1405
01:20:37.471 --> 01:20:40.830
he has a male white privilege and that,

1406
01:20:40.831 --> 01:20:43.340
that discounts the fact.

1407
01:20:43.350 --> 01:20:46.700
So she doesn't have to take any responsibility whatsoever.
Yeah,
I'm gonna.

1408
01:20:46.770 --> 01:20:49.940
I have to tell you that I disagree with that.
Well everyone who you have now,

1409
01:20:49.950 --> 01:20:52.590
people are going to talk shit about me for days on the Internet and I don't

1410
01:20:52.591 --> 01:20:56.520
really fucking care because the situation is this.
It takes two fucking people.

1411
01:20:56.810 --> 01:21:00.630
Yeah,
it does.
The,
so what they've taken,
they've taken a hard stance.

1412
01:21:00.660 --> 01:21:05.310
The other way saying that everyone who has sex with anyone who's drunk is raping

1413
01:21:05.311 --> 01:21:08.520
them and including women who have sex with drunk men.

1414
01:21:08.730 --> 01:21:11.700
If you have sex with a drug saying the man,
you're raping the man.

1415
01:21:12.390 --> 01:21:15.880
No Man would ever admit that though,
Ben,
we're happy to get rich.

1416
01:21:17.940 --> 01:21:22.890
It's so preposterous and it's so gross.
It's a bunch of social retards.

1417
01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:27.990
That's the reality.
The reality is it's social retires and they're,
first of all,

1418
01:21:27.991 --> 01:21:32.150
you're ignoring the broad spectrum of alcoholic and Ebda.

1419
01:21:32.240 --> 01:21:33.090
Exactly.

1420
01:21:33.180 --> 01:21:37.500
There's tipsy and then there's fucking unconscious conscious that's rape.

1421
01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:39.350
Just before she wasn't.
That's great.

1422
01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:44.660
Three quarters before unconscious athlete unconscious pretty much raped.

1423
01:21:44.900 --> 01:21:49.890
I mean it gets,
it gets less raping as you get more sober,
but the reality of,

1424
01:21:49.950 --> 01:21:51.390
you know,
I'm not laughing about rape,

1425
01:21:51.391 --> 01:21:53.640
I just want everybody to know that it is true.
I mean,

1426
01:21:54.210 --> 01:21:58.620
I think the genius of the Feminine Agenda In this respect,
it's almost like a,

1427
01:21:59.730 --> 01:22:02.760
it's almost a side effect and that genius is,

1428
01:22:02.761 --> 01:22:05.670
it forces the conversation because it is important.
It is important.

1429
01:22:06.060 --> 01:22:08.940
And people who get people fucked up and do things to their body,

1430
01:22:08.970 --> 01:22:11.240
fucking assholes.
They're pieces of shit.
Totally.

1431
01:22:11.310 --> 01:22:15.890
Whether it's a man or whether it's a woman care.
Yes,
and I think that there's,

1432
01:22:15.940 --> 01:22:18.690
there's a good in that that this argument,
yes.
Discussed,

1433
01:22:18.930 --> 01:22:22.560
but I don't buy the delivery man.
I don't buy that Pz Myers guy.

1434
01:22:22.561 --> 01:22:27.360
I think he's a creeper and I think what the way he released that information

1435
01:22:27.570 --> 01:22:31.020
without,
first of all,
he's supposed to be a skeptic and the word skeptic,

1436
01:22:31.050 --> 01:22:31.920
if you're a skeptic,

1437
01:22:32.090 --> 01:22:36.990
you understand that the worst piece of evidence that you can possibly receive,

1438
01:22:36.991 --> 01:22:40.600
right?
It's a personal experience.
Someone telling you what happened,
right.

1439
01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:42.780
You don't know what they're saying.

1440
01:22:42.870 --> 01:22:44.550
You don't know how much of what they're saying.
It's not only that,

1441
01:22:44.551 --> 01:22:46.710
he didn't even get it secondhand,
you didn't get it from the person.

1442
01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:50.160
He got it second hand.
Wow.
You got it from another person who told him.

1443
01:22:50.161 --> 01:22:54.480
So it's nonsense.
Now it's getting totally blown out.
Yeah.
Oh,

1444
01:22:54.481 --> 01:22:57.150
totally blown out.
Yeah,
totally blown.
This is why I can prove he's a creeper.

1445
01:22:57.360 --> 01:23:01.200
Jamie,
pull this up.
Pull up.
Pz Myers isn't a feminist.

1446
01:23:01.230 --> 01:23:05.170
There's this video of him at this conference making all these jokes with this

1447
01:23:05.171 --> 01:23:06.400
woman saying that she's going to,

1448
01:23:06.910 --> 01:23:10.750
she would have to have sex with him if she got these,
this card game wrong.

1449
01:23:10.751 --> 01:23:11.980
She got the wrong card.

1450
01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:17.400
It's so gross and so transparent that I kind of love when you find a jewel like

1451
01:23:18.491 --> 01:23:22.570
this because you get to see,
well,
oh,
this is a social retard.

1452
01:23:22.930 --> 01:23:26.590
This is a guy that's socked with women his whole lives and now he's in this

1453
01:23:26.591 --> 01:23:28.180
position of power being a professor.

1454
01:23:28.240 --> 01:23:33.240
So he decides that he's a male feminist and so yes he is and so he bathes in the

1455
01:23:33.791 --> 01:23:37.840
warm milk of the adulation of all the people that are super progressive that go

1456
01:23:37.841 --> 01:23:42.010
along with them.
Yet he stifles dissent in a very radical way in his forums.

1457
01:23:42.220 --> 01:23:46.900
If you disagree,
even if you disagree in a very polite and civil way.

1458
01:23:46.901 --> 01:23:49.130
With him,
outing is Michael Shermer guys,

1459
01:23:49.131 --> 01:23:51.580
I suppose it rapist for having sex with an intoxicated woman.

1460
01:23:52.030 --> 01:23:53.800
Even if you disagree in a civil way,

1461
01:23:53.801 --> 01:23:57.280
he bands you from the forum and he's an idiot because now he's not open for

1462
01:23:57.281 --> 01:24:00.910
discussion and it's all about him and his idea.
Massive censorship.
So wait,

1463
01:24:00.911 --> 01:24:03.280
so he outdid the guy who raped the girl.
Well,

1464
01:24:03.281 --> 01:24:08.281
he outdid the guy who he says he was told had sex with a woman who could not

1465
01:24:08.831 --> 01:24:11.020
consent.
No one ever says rape,

1466
01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:15.750
but he uses the word rape liberally after that.
And it's,

1467
01:24:15.751 --> 01:24:18.520
it's a weird thing.
He doesn't say the guys are rapist,

1468
01:24:18.521 --> 01:24:23.350
but in other posts they talk about rape and that is rape and having sex with

1469
01:24:23.351 --> 01:24:27.070
someone who's intoxicated is rape,
but that the,
the broad black,

1470
01:24:27.071 --> 01:24:31.000
the black and white scale of that is so ridiculous.

1471
01:24:31.090 --> 01:24:34.930
But it's also why are you responsible when you drive,

1472
01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:38.500
but you're not responsible when you fuck.
No.
That's a great point,
man.

1473
01:24:38.530 --> 01:24:41.230
You don't really know that you're too drunk to fuck.
Right.

1474
01:24:41.450 --> 01:24:45.010
You don't get yourself in that position.
And I'm not saying rape is okay.
Again,

1475
01:24:45.011 --> 01:24:49.810
I need to,
I need to say that.
But what is wrong,
Ashley?

1476
01:24:49.811 --> 01:24:52.450
A lot of times women put themselves in these ways,

1477
01:24:52.510 --> 01:24:56.290
and I'm not saying they should be raped,
but really the world is fucked up.

1478
01:24:56.440 --> 01:24:56.591
You know?

1479
01:24:56.591 --> 01:25:01.300
Getting drunk and a situation that could turn bad is not a smart choice.
Yeah,

1480
01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:04.130
but I don't think you should ever blame the woman for 19 align.

1481
01:25:04.490 --> 01:25:09.260
I don't even like to think that way because they have to be.
Have to.
Yes.

1482
01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:12.610
I'm telling you.
I'm telling you,
I can say that because I used to be a woman.

1483
01:25:12.970 --> 01:25:15.970
You can not put yourself in that situation.

1484
01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:17.830
I'm totally on the same page with you.
However,

1485
01:25:17.831 --> 01:25:20.860
I don't think that it's not okay to rape.
So I know it's a double.

1486
01:25:20.890 --> 01:25:23.230
I'm kind of saying something really kind of roundabout,

1487
01:25:23.231 --> 01:25:26.710
but really be conscious of these things.
Yes.

1488
01:25:26.860 --> 01:25:30.450
Don't put yourself in an environment.
It's almost unrelated to this story.

1489
01:25:31.540 --> 01:25:35.450
This guy,
there's no excuse.
If he did fuck,

1490
01:25:35.530 --> 01:25:38.260
get someone fucked up and do something to their body.
There's no excuse for that.

1491
01:25:38.261 --> 01:25:40.360
Right?
Right.
Whether or not this woman shouldn't have been there,

1492
01:25:40.361 --> 01:25:42.310
but she should have known better.
It doesn't matter,

1493
01:25:42.370 --> 01:25:43.960
but we don't know what he don't know what happened.

1494
01:25:43.961 --> 01:25:47.530
Exactly what happened to call yourself a skeptic.
Yes.
And to put,

1495
01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:49.360
that's not a skeptic about what they're doing.

1496
01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:52.270
What they're doing is getting social brownie points.

1497
01:25:52.300 --> 01:25:56.200
They are bathing and the warm glow of the adulation of their followers.

1498
01:25:56.201 --> 01:25:56.680
That's the things.

1499
01:25:56.680 --> 01:25:59.740
You can't say anything anymore without people taking it and saying you're saying

1500
01:25:59.741 --> 01:26:02.860
one thing.
Did you find that video play?
Please listen to this.

1501
01:26:03.130 --> 01:26:04.520
This is fascinating.

1502
01:26:04.810 --> 01:26:07.860
Pulled it up so we can see it doing your belly dance while this is,

1503
01:26:07.890 --> 01:26:08.721
this is the guy,

1504
01:26:08.721 --> 01:26:12.170
this is the guy with the beard who apparently is a very brilliant man and I'm

1505
01:26:12.380 --> 01:26:15.840
professor of biology and she made a lot university clothes off.

1506
01:26:16.140 --> 01:26:18.030
<v 7>What's Nice,
she made me</v>

1507
01:26:18.060 --> 01:26:23.040
<v 4>see my clothes off.
Can you just let it?
Yeah,
I,
this is where this,
this video,</v>

1508
01:26:23.070 --> 01:26:25.250
uh,
some guys annoyed at him

1509
01:26:25.380 --> 01:26:26.400
<v 5>for all these different things.</v>

1510
01:26:27.670 --> 01:26:32.570
<v 7>We lie,
we lie.
We always lie to you.
So get off my stage.</v>

1511
01:26:32.571 --> 01:26:34.330
I got work to do.
So He's,

1512
01:26:34.710 --> 01:26:38.780
<v 4>and around here,
everything's cool.
You know,
just being silly with someone.</v>

1513
01:26:39.170 --> 01:26:43.580
Now this is him dealing with the other woman.
Some cards.

1514
01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:47.900
<v 7>Okay.
You write there purple shirt.
Yes,</v>

1515
01:26:49.260 --> 01:26:51.680
<v 5>you'll do.
So he does not know very clearly.</v>

1516
01:26:51.700 --> 01:26:53.790
Does not know her pulling her out of the audience.

1517
01:26:56.880 --> 01:26:58.860
<v 4>I Dunno what that says.
We can't see it because there were a thing.</v>

1518
01:26:59.330 --> 01:27:01.440
So is it turns on the charm.
Okay.

1519
01:27:01.990 --> 01:27:05.590
<v 7>Of course there could also be higher stakes.
We could say,
you know,
for instance,</v>

1520
01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:08.380
if I win this hand,
I get to kill any chew

1521
01:27:11.650 --> 01:27:15.130
they're playing,
they're playing cards here possibly.
Uh,
another thing is,

1522
01:27:15.131 --> 01:27:16.510
you know,
if you win the hand,

1523
01:27:16.540 --> 01:27:19.150
they know I would have to submit and have sex with you.

1524
01:27:21.410 --> 01:27:25.750
<v 4>Wow.
Okay.
He's just joking around I guess.
But it's very awkward.</v>

1525
01:27:25.790 --> 01:27:30.510
<v 7>You have to submit and have sex with you.
Imagine if that was your wife.
You win.</v>

1526
01:27:31.290 --> 01:27:34.360
Okay.
Look at it.
I will give you my hotel room number.

1527
01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:37.650
Write down what we'll do the sex thing later anyway.

1528
01:27:38.170 --> 01:27:40.510
<v 4>Wow.
Okay.
The brush off.
Well,</v>

1529
01:27:40.890 --> 01:27:44.570
<v 7>it says go back to your seat.
No,
take the cards with you.
I'm good.</v>

1530
01:27:44.850 --> 01:27:46.930
I gotta call you back for the sex part later.
So hang on.

1531
01:27:47.970 --> 01:27:51.090
<v 5>Okay.
You hear that buddy</v>

1532
01:27:51.340 --> 01:27:54.910
<v 4>in the feminist movement.
Okay,
let's just,
you don't need to play the rest of it,</v>

1533
01:27:55.270 --> 01:27:57.010
but that

1534
01:27:57.690 --> 01:28:02.190
<v 5>guy needs to shut the fuck up.
I'm like,</v>

1535
01:28:02.220 --> 01:28:06.450
my brain is kind of getting it from what I,
what my suspicions were.

1536
01:28:06.451 --> 01:28:10.100
My suspicions were social retard.
Right.
And that is,
that's the,

1537
01:28:10.110 --> 01:28:13.170
those are the words of a social retard.
Yeah.
That's an awkward person.

1538
01:28:13.380 --> 01:28:17.730
Tries to make a joke about having sex with a woman.
Yeah.
I am a feminist.
Yes,

1539
01:28:17.731 --> 01:28:20.850
exactly.
If that was your wife or girlfriend and he did that,

1540
01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:23.700
you would be horrified anyways.
I don't care if it was my wife or a girlfriend.

1541
01:28:23.740 --> 01:28:27.300
He,
he,
he's not a feminist.
Yeah.
You don't talk like that as a feminist.

1542
01:28:27.301 --> 01:28:31.530
You first off,
that's just really inappropriate behavior.
He's a hypocrite.
Oh,

1543
01:28:32.310 --> 01:28:33.420
clearly.
And,
but,

1544
01:28:33.421 --> 01:28:38.421
but what I was saying before was that even people in the progressive movement do

1545
01:28:38.551 --> 01:28:42.480
Shitty,
douchey things like that.
Like this guy with this Michael Sherman thing,

1546
01:28:42.510 --> 01:28:45.690
right?
It's this,
it's that it all comes from the same place.

1547
01:28:45.691 --> 01:28:48.930
It doesn't come from a place of love.
It doesn't come from a place of peace.
No.

1548
01:28:48.990 --> 01:28:53.990
Even in reaching out to try to supposedly elevate those who are in trouble or

1549
01:28:54.990 --> 01:28:58.680
who are depressed or who are or repressed or who are,

1550
01:28:58.830 --> 01:29:02.070
who were shit on by society.
You are doing

1551
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:06.790
<v 3>it to prop yourself up a and to hurt someone else,
isn't it?</v>

1552
01:29:06.840 --> 01:29:11.820
You're not doing it in a loving way.
That's an agenda.
Clearly an agenda.

1553
01:29:11.821 --> 01:29:15.540
And he found his,
found his people that he could totally work as agenda to.

1554
01:29:15.570 --> 01:29:18.700
Exactly which is that feminist fucking dangerous.
And that's just it.

1555
01:29:18.701 --> 01:29:22.170
Just like religion.
Yeah.
We were talking about earlier today,
it's the same thing.

1556
01:29:22.171 --> 01:29:25.410
It's coming from a place of fear.
It's coming from a place of control.

1557
01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:27.720
It's the same goddamn thing.
And the control,

1558
01:29:27.810 --> 01:29:31.470
it's super obvious when you see the fucking suppression of free speech that he

1559
01:29:31.471 --> 01:29:35.910
puts on his own blogs.
The fact that on his own blogs,
he sensors,

1560
01:29:35.911 --> 01:29:39.210
anybody that disagrees,
even if they disagree,
sits on a piece of shit.

1561
01:29:40.500 --> 01:29:41.850
Like he doesn't even know what he's doing.

1562
01:29:41.851 --> 01:29:43.950
And that's the thing is with communities,

1563
01:29:43.951 --> 01:29:47.730
a lot of times they censor our speech and they tell us,

1564
01:29:47.731 --> 01:29:50.970
we can't say,
and I'm using myself as an example here.

1565
01:29:50.970 --> 01:29:55.230
I'm not allowed to say certain things because they don't reflect our community

1566
01:29:55.231 --> 01:29:58.620
pro,
but I'm like,
but I'm a person first and it is the way I believe.

1567
01:29:58.621 --> 01:30:01.290
And I think it is important for me to speak my mind about certain things.

1568
01:30:01.440 --> 01:30:04.500
We all can't think the same way.
Like we talked about earlier.

1569
01:30:04.501 --> 01:30:07.320
We all have different ways we think things should be or things.

1570
01:30:07.470 --> 01:30:11.130
And it's only from my own personal experience,
but within my specific community,

1571
01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:14.790
I'm not allowed to say certain words or react to certain things.

1572
01:30:14.791 --> 01:30:16.890
I'm not like who?
Why?
Well,

1573
01:30:16.891 --> 01:30:21.690
I think for a lot of folks that do feel marginalized or have been marginalized,

1574
01:30:21.691 --> 01:30:23.220
like Dave fucking,

1575
01:30:23.221 --> 01:30:27.540
they've hit that the guy from network are mad as hell and I'm not going to take

1576
01:30:27.550 --> 01:30:30.900
me anymore.
Right?
So like these are the parameters.
This is what we'll accept.

1577
01:30:30.901 --> 01:30:34.860
This is what we want except in,
in,
in,
in that way.
I understand that.
I do,

1578
01:30:34.900 --> 01:30:38.070
but I'm telling you right now,
I wouldn't be where I am right now.

1579
01:30:38.100 --> 01:30:42.140
If I had that anger,
I wouldn't be get in the door,

1580
01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:43.200
didn't get in the doors.

1581
01:30:43.201 --> 01:30:47.160
People wouldn't want to listen to me because I was Morocco and I really have to

1582
01:30:47.161 --> 01:30:50.520
tell you a lot of the communities are really angry and they alienate people like

1583
01:30:50.521 --> 01:30:54.120
myself who want to further our acceptance in the world.

1584
01:30:54.121 --> 01:30:59.121
I have obviously I want to but because I don't use the same way driving angry

1585
01:30:59.431 --> 01:31:01.620
force,
then I'm the bad person.

1586
01:31:01.621 --> 01:31:03.900
I'm actually not for that and I don't believe in that.
I believe,

1587
01:31:03.901 --> 01:31:04.830
like I said earlier,

1588
01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:08.850
really getting people to understand you have to educate the people who don't

1589
01:31:08.851 --> 01:31:11.940
understand us and isn't it funny that like when we were talking about earlier

1590
01:31:11.941 --> 01:31:15.180
like weird acronyms that people you,

1591
01:31:16.050 --> 01:31:20.400
categories that are very specific and then language like privileged that gets

1592
01:31:20.401 --> 01:31:22.290
used almost as like,
you know like,

1593
01:31:22.380 --> 01:31:25.200
like you let them know you're speaking the lingo feasible.

1594
01:31:25.410 --> 01:31:29.670
Noam Chomsky actually addressed this because he's a linguist and he was talking

1595
01:31:29.671 --> 01:31:33.570
about how they're sort of pretending like,

1596
01:31:34.230 --> 01:31:38.910
like a lot of a radical progressive's pretending that this is almost scientific

1597
01:31:39.060 --> 01:31:43.420
because they hear quantum theorists talk and this is like really strange if

1598
01:31:43.421 --> 01:31:45.570
theory will language that no one really understands.

1599
01:31:45.660 --> 01:31:50.660
So they sort of use the same kind of jargon in regards to psychology and

1600
01:31:51.121 --> 01:31:54.300
sociology and in regards to like progressive.
Exactly.

1601
01:31:54.380 --> 01:31:56.550
And so they're not trying to be understood.

1602
01:31:56.700 --> 01:32:01.240
They're trying to be outside of the realm of understanding so that you can't

1603
01:32:01.241 --> 01:32:03.950
question them,
that you aren't going to question them,

1604
01:32:03.970 --> 01:32:06.250
but they don't in their mind you can't,
you don't even get it.

1605
01:32:06.251 --> 01:32:10.980
It's Lbtq team that's totally out of,
you're an Ari and I don't use it.

1606
01:32:10.981 --> 01:32:13.990
So like I don't know if you know what CIS gender it is.
Know what does that mean?

1607
01:32:13.990 --> 01:32:14.591
I've heard that.

1608
01:32:14.591 --> 01:32:18.370
I don't know what basically I biological per like you are born in the body that

1609
01:32:18.371 --> 01:32:21.730
you have chosen to be in what assistant for?
So sis,

1610
01:32:21.760 --> 01:32:24.820
you have to look it up on the Internet.
I don't use it.
And I'll tell you why.

1611
01:32:24.980 --> 01:32:29.440
Gender,
C I s yeah,
so I don't use it and I don't,
it's fine.
I use it.

1612
01:32:29.441 --> 01:32:30.880
I use it because I want to educate.

1613
01:32:31.480 --> 01:32:34.330
Now I have to educate you on cis gendered and when I just used the word

1614
01:32:34.331 --> 01:32:38.920
biological,
you get biological,
do you not?
Yes,
that's better.
That's better.

1615
01:32:38.921 --> 01:32:41.440
CISGENDER and Wikipedia.
According to Wikipedia,

1616
01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:46.680
oftens of really abbreviated to simply sis described related types of gender

1617
01:32:46.991 --> 01:32:51.760
identity where an individual self perception of their gender matches the sex

1618
01:32:51.761 --> 01:32:56.080
they were assigned at birth.
So meaning biological,
biological,

1619
01:32:56.620 --> 01:32:57.310
yeah,

1620
01:32:57.310 --> 01:33:02.310
but they felt a need and I'm not being rude or disrespectful,

1621
01:33:03.460 --> 01:33:07.690
but it they felt a need to make their own word because you have,

1622
01:33:07.720 --> 01:33:12.370
you as a biological person or the straight world has made have made words for
us.

1623
01:33:12.790 --> 01:33:16.140
So it's sorta like we now have our own word for you.

1624
01:33:17.260 --> 01:33:20.260
So I'm like that's cool.
Go right ahead.
But that's not,
you know,
for me,

1625
01:33:20.261 --> 01:33:24.610
I need to educate you and if I keep getting watered down,
you lose,

1626
01:33:24.790 --> 01:33:28.120
you lose it,
you lose it and you're not really getting it.

1627
01:33:28.180 --> 01:33:31.280
Do you know about the case where there was a,

1628
01:33:31.290 --> 01:33:35.980
a a man who became a female and then started MMA fighting sort of my friend.

1629
01:33:36.100 --> 01:33:39.580
She's your friend,
of course.
What do you think about that situation?

1630
01:33:39.581 --> 01:33:41.530
What do you think about the,
uh,
first of all,

1631
01:33:41.531 --> 01:33:43.970
the fact that she didn't tell people that she used to be a man,
right.

1632
01:33:44.440 --> 01:33:48.070
Mechanic and fought a bunch of women.
And I get it.
I got it.

1633
01:33:48.160 --> 01:33:52.670
And then now that she wants to compete as a woman,
well,
okay,
I,

1634
01:33:52.780 --> 01:33:55.520
she's a woman.
To me,
she's a woman.
She completely changed.

1635
01:33:56.230 --> 01:33:58.210
He identifies as a woman.
Again,

1636
01:33:58.211 --> 01:34:01.000
we're going to come back to what makes you a man and a woman right now with

1637
01:34:01.001 --> 01:34:03.490
fighting,
with fighting.
I,

1638
01:34:03.550 --> 01:34:08.050
it's not my profession and it's not my thing.
I don't,
but she wrote me,

1639
01:34:08.260 --> 01:34:11.770
so can I show you what she wrote me?
Sure.
And then I want you to read it.
Sure.

1640
01:34:11.771 --> 01:34:13.150
That you can see what she said.

1641
01:34:13.151 --> 01:34:14.890
Because of course I knew you were going to bring this up.

1642
01:34:14.891 --> 01:34:18.790
And I think it's very important that you get it from her.
Because for me,

1643
01:34:18.791 --> 01:34:22.240
I can't speak for her because she's a trans woman.
I'm a trans man.

1644
01:34:22.360 --> 01:34:24.610
But you can't speak for her because it's not.
And also it's not me.

1645
01:34:24.611 --> 01:34:29.080
And also I'm not,
I'm not versed enough in that world of,
of this,
of that sport.

1646
01:34:29.110 --> 01:34:31.090
So I can't tell you what the rules,

1647
01:34:31.180 --> 01:34:34.030
but if you were just going to ask me generally what I feel about it,

1648
01:34:34.090 --> 01:34:38.380
I do feel that she has a woman and I do feel that she has the right to fight as

1649
01:34:38.381 --> 01:34:38.711
a woman.

1650
01:34:38.711 --> 01:34:42.040
It's like saying that I can't use the men's restroom because I'm not really a

1651
01:34:42.041 --> 01:34:46.250
man.
It is a general kind of way.
Again.

1652
01:34:46.570 --> 01:34:50.200
Well why don't you read what you need first to see this?

1653
01:34:50.201 --> 01:34:52.720
Cause I think it is super important that um,

1654
01:34:52.840 --> 01:34:57.710
I think it's a completely valid argument.
110% don't get wrong,
but I,

1655
01:34:57.950 --> 01:34:58.783
oh,

1656
01:35:00.140 --> 01:35:04.810
<v 4>I don't have any service in here.
What a bummer.
[inaudible] t and t?</v>

1657
01:35:05.270 --> 01:35:09.560
No,
I have t mall because I have one.
It was unlocked phones.

1658
01:35:10.180 --> 01:35:14.960
Can you step outside that door?
You can.
Oh yeah,
yeah,

1659
01:35:14.961 --> 01:35:18.030
yeah.
We have it.
Yeah.
Jamie,
can you give them passwords?
Nope.

1660
01:35:18.340 --> 01:35:22.930
Let me since while you're looking for,
here's two issues with it.

1661
01:35:22.940 --> 01:35:25.430
One that I have is the male frame.

1662
01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:29.390
The mechanics of the male frightened it is different.
It's different.

1663
01:35:29.391 --> 01:35:34.391
Like if you are a person who has large man hands and man's shoulders,

1664
01:35:35.030 --> 01:35:35.811
that doesn't go away.

1665
01:35:35.811 --> 01:35:39.350
If you take estrogen and the mechanics of the male frame or a significant

1666
01:35:39.351 --> 01:35:39.801
advantage,

1667
01:35:39.801 --> 01:35:44.510
there's also a significant advantage in reaction speed that men enjoy 10% it's a

1668
01:35:44.511 --> 01:35:49.340
massive amounts that's across the board pretty much when athletes is a massive

1669
01:35:49.341 --> 01:35:51.770
reaction time difference between men and females.

1670
01:35:52.220 --> 01:35:57.220
There's also learning the skills as a man being up to 30 years of being a man

1671
01:35:57.830 --> 01:35:58.880
and then becoming a woman.

1672
01:35:59.060 --> 01:36:03.470
These are all completely unfair advantages that a man would have entering into

1673
01:36:03.471 --> 01:36:07.490
female combat sports.
Now,
every man is the same time.

1674
01:36:07.580 --> 01:36:11.240
I'm not saying that we will get into that,
but here's the big one.

1675
01:36:11.420 --> 01:36:15.450
The big one is she didn't say that she used to be a man.
She never told anyone?

1676
01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:18.470
No,
not until it came out.
And then when it came out,

1677
01:36:18.740 --> 01:36:22.370
the last fight was sanctioned as her being a trans woman.

1678
01:36:22.550 --> 01:36:27.290
But the fights before that,
her opponents,
I've spoken to them,
they were furious.

1679
01:36:27.530 --> 01:36:31.070
They were upset and they were told that they were bigots by people online.

1680
01:36:31.071 --> 01:36:34.790
They were attacked.
This one girl who emailed me and thanked me,

1681
01:36:35.090 --> 01:36:39.500
she was telling me that she was getting attacked left and right by so called

1682
01:36:39.501 --> 01:36:44.220
progressive's because they were calling her a bigot because a trans woman that

1683
01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:44.811
she didn't know.

1684
01:36:44.811 --> 01:36:48.620
It used to be a man fodder and she was pissed off about it because the kind of

1685
01:36:48.621 --> 01:36:52.840
rag daalder well,
I mean there's so much more involved in it,

1686
01:36:52.841 --> 01:36:53.980
so you know that right.
It can't,

1687
01:36:54.050 --> 01:36:57.770
it's not black and white like anything on talking it.
Nothing is black and white.

1688
01:36:57.771 --> 01:37:01.430
It's just not.
It's not.
And I shouldn't say the guy,
should she ragdolled her,

1689
01:37:01.440 --> 01:37:04.100
she beat the shit out of them.
Like a guy would be the shit out of women.

1690
01:37:04.101 --> 01:37:07.730
It's hard to watch because if you watch the physical advantages that she has

1691
01:37:07.731 --> 01:37:10.510
over these women,
I she's not that good.
I know what,

1692
01:37:10.550 --> 01:37:13.900
when I look at someone who's good technically profession,
I totally,

1693
01:37:13.910 --> 01:37:16.550
I understand what I'm seeing as someone ragdoll people.

1694
01:37:16.700 --> 01:37:21.200
I'm seeing her smashed these girls and then I think it's because of her frame

1695
01:37:21.260 --> 01:37:23.660
app.
Look at my hands,
see the size of my hands.

1696
01:37:23.960 --> 01:37:25.940
No matter how many female hormones I took,

1697
01:37:25.941 --> 01:37:30.650
I would still have them look at my hands.
Exactly.
Hands,
gas of advantage.

1698
01:37:30.680 --> 01:37:32.750
There's a massive advantage in the shape of the hips.

1699
01:37:33.020 --> 01:37:35.150
There's a massive advantage and the width of the shoulders,

1700
01:37:35.330 --> 01:37:38.420
there's size of the psychological women that are her side.
You're right.

1701
01:37:38.450 --> 01:37:42.140
There are,
there are a few,
but it's still not exactly the same.

1702
01:37:42.141 --> 01:37:46.640
This to the mechanical advantages of the mailbox is still exist if you have a

1703
01:37:46.641 --> 01:37:50.270
man and a woman and that the same way in those same sort of muscularity,

1704
01:37:50.540 --> 01:37:52.580
there's still a difference in the frame.

1705
01:37:52.610 --> 01:37:55.950
This is difference in the shape of the hips.
There's a difference.
The

1706
01:37:56.070 --> 01:38:00.330
<v 3>reaction time frame is still female.
Yeah,
I totally understand that.</v>

1707
01:38:00.480 --> 01:38:04.230
But that said,
I think,
I think you have to read what she said because again,

1708
01:38:04.260 --> 01:38:07.010
I think it's important.
There are variables though,
and there's,

1709
01:38:07.050 --> 01:38:11.010
there's Serena Williams who's a female totally.

1710
01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:12.640
And then there's girls who like,

1711
01:38:12.900 --> 01:38:16.170
there's a woman who was fighting on the ultimate fighter right now is a very

1712
01:38:16.171 --> 01:38:20.160
skilled Roxanne modifier.
She's,
but she's very feminine.
She's very funny.

1713
01:38:20.161 --> 01:38:24.120
She doesn't have that fast twitch explosive muscle fiber that you know,

1714
01:38:24.121 --> 01:38:29.020
some women have more fallen,
lost a lot of that.
When she started to take an AP,

1715
01:38:29.130 --> 01:38:31.140
she doesn't have the testosterone in her body.

1716
01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:35.430
I am down with almost everything except combat sports.
The reason being is

1717
01:38:37.260 --> 01:38:39.720
because of the frame,
the hands,
the mechanical advantage,

1718
01:38:39.721 --> 01:38:43.290
the reaction time and the consequences.
When your physical health,

1719
01:38:43.500 --> 01:38:47.010
the consequences of fighting you're,
you're getting hurt badly.

1720
01:38:47.010 --> 01:38:50.460
And if there's an unfair advantage and that person uses that unfair advantage,

1721
01:38:50.461 --> 01:38:54.780
whether it's taking steroids and cheating by Tate or taking blood enhancers like

1722
01:38:54.810 --> 01:38:58.680
EPO,
those are all illegal because they changed the field.

1723
01:38:58.790 --> 01:39:01.820
Now there are people that are born with more testosterone.
There's a,

1724
01:39:01.821 --> 01:39:05.010
it's a natural advantage you can choose to and not to fight them,

1725
01:39:05.340 --> 01:39:07.230
but in this situation we're not dealing with,

1726
01:39:07.470 --> 01:39:09.420
we're dealing with a manmade variable,

1727
01:39:09.480 --> 01:39:13.410
and I think it needs to be a addressed before you ever fight for sure.

1728
01:39:13.580 --> 01:39:17.850
And I think fighting four times or however many times she fought in in secret

1729
01:39:17.851 --> 01:39:21.910
like that as a trans woman,
it's very dangerous.
I think it's true.

1730
01:39:21.940 --> 01:39:24.900
I understand your point.
I completely,
dude,
I completely do.

1731
01:39:24.901 --> 01:39:27.870
And it's a very difficult,
like I'm saying,
for very difficult,

1732
01:39:28.590 --> 01:39:32.790
I know as a trans person,
I guess for me.
Yeah.
Okay.

1733
01:39:32.791 --> 01:39:34.170
So I'm going to give you the example of this.

1734
01:39:34.200 --> 01:39:37.590
Let's say I was going to go home with somebody and have sex with them.
Okay?

1735
01:39:37.720 --> 01:39:40.830
I am a huge,
huge advocate for disclosure,

1736
01:39:41.160 --> 01:39:43.560
so I'm not gonna if we're just date,

1737
01:39:43.590 --> 01:39:44.970
where are they hanging out in the bar and drinking?

1738
01:39:44.971 --> 01:39:47.130
I don't need to tell you that I'm a man with a pussy.
Right?

1739
01:39:47.340 --> 01:39:50.000
But let's say we're going to go home and fuck right.

1740
01:39:50.190 --> 01:39:55.110
I need to tell you right now,
dude,
you're not going to get a cock right now.

1741
01:39:55.111 --> 01:39:56.160
You're going to get a pussy.

1742
01:39:56.670 --> 01:40:00.690
And like that is so important to me that people understand that you cannot put

1743
01:40:00.691 --> 01:40:03.540
that other person in that position.
You know what I'm saying?

1744
01:40:03.541 --> 01:40:07.200
Like you cannot put somebody in a position of uncomfortability when you bring

1745
01:40:07.201 --> 01:40:12.000
them home and they think one thing and you do another big on disclosure.

1746
01:40:12.090 --> 01:40:15.750
Good for you.
Um,
I think,
I don't,
I can't speak for this woman,

1747
01:40:15.780 --> 01:40:19.650
but I think in her case she wanted to be a woman and she was a woman to make

1748
01:40:19.651 --> 01:40:22.980
that choice in her own mind.
What was more important and would people,

1749
01:40:23.040 --> 01:40:27.480
how did people find out?
Somebody told on her really got in trouble,

1750
01:40:28.890 --> 01:40:32.940
but she's legally a female.
Is she not a,
I don't know where her,

1751
01:40:33.180 --> 01:40:35.930
some commissions will accept that.
And you know,
she gets,

1752
01:40:35.940 --> 01:40:38.400
her birth certificate was changed.
She's legally a female.

1753
01:40:38.490 --> 01:40:41.070
I don't know if that happened with her or whatever.
I don't know.

1754
01:40:41.071 --> 01:40:43.710
I think you still,
it's a medical thing.
The disclosure thing,

1755
01:40:43.770 --> 01:40:47.010
I think in in some athletic commissions,
being a trans woman is a,

1756
01:40:47.011 --> 01:40:51.540
as a medical disclosure saying,
let's say I were to go start fighting MMA,

1757
01:40:52.430 --> 01:40:54.280
but I have to that I was a track

1758
01:40:54.340 --> 01:40:56.950
<v 6>that I'm a trans man.
Yeah,
I think you probably would.</v>

1759
01:40:57.650 --> 01:41:00.650
<v 3>I would imagine it depends on the commission because I</v>

1760
01:41:02.230 --> 01:41:06.230
don't think people are going to make a big deal out of it as me going in.
Right.

1761
01:41:06.320 --> 01:41:11.120
No.
Then as a woman,
I think it's totally different for trans women.

1762
01:41:11.121 --> 01:41:11.631
I'm telling you,

1763
01:41:11.631 --> 01:41:14.270
they have to deal with this all across the board for the restroom.

1764
01:41:14.890 --> 01:41:18.470
The advantage we just discussed,
like your small hand.
Right,
and my giant here.

1765
01:41:18.490 --> 01:41:22.100
Right,
exactly.
If I just became a woman and we had a cage fight,
I would,

1766
01:41:22.220 --> 01:41:25.300
I would have a big advantage just because of the frame of your friends.

1767
01:41:25.310 --> 01:41:27.620
A big advantage.
I know it's an advantage.

1768
01:41:27.621 --> 01:41:30.640
I know as a martial arts expert my whole life,
what,
what,

1769
01:41:30.800 --> 01:41:33.950
how much that plays a factor.
It plays a big factor.
So

1770
01:41:33.990 --> 01:41:36.360
<v 6>it,
so,
yeah,
I know it's,
it's a,</v>

1771
01:41:36.430 --> 01:41:41.110
it's a fascinating discussion and of course I,
I do understand both sides.
I do.

1772
01:41:41.111 --> 01:41:44.290
Don't,
don't get me wrong here.
I'm going to read.
Can I read it?
Yeah.

1773
01:41:44.291 --> 01:41:48.970
Read her statement.
I've been taking estrogen,
uh,
for around 10 years now.

1774
01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:50.410
I had my GRS,

1775
01:41:50.430 --> 01:41:55.430
her sex reassignment six years ago after GRS mtfs male to females have a lower

1776
01:41:56.321 --> 01:41:59.440
testosterone count than even cisgendered females.

1777
01:41:59.770 --> 01:42:03.280
This is regardless of if we take estrogen or not,

1778
01:42:03.790 --> 01:42:07.180
it's harder for me to keep off that.
It affects my cardio,

1779
01:42:07.190 --> 01:42:11.350
my bone density and decreased female range.
At first,
he,

1780
01:42:11.380 --> 01:42:15.310
you said muscles will be stronger,
but he backtracked from that.

1781
01:42:15.311 --> 01:42:18.010
When he found out he was wrong.
Did you say that?
No.

1782
01:42:18.700 --> 01:42:23.590
He said my bone density was a feat in female range.
He backtracked from that.

1783
01:42:23.760 --> 01:42:27.280
Awesome.
Okay.
He found out he found that out.
What?

1784
01:42:27.281 --> 01:42:31.660
He had been left with his bone structure.
What you just said to me,

1785
01:42:32.170 --> 01:42:36.260
that's what I last heard him clinging onto.
He was tron don't,

1786
01:42:36.370 --> 01:42:40.720
she's obviously upset about it because you know,
she,
she just has anyway,

1787
01:42:40.870 --> 01:42:45.250
he was trying to say that I have a great advantage because of my reach,

1788
01:42:45.430 --> 01:42:47.440
but my reach isn't that great.

1789
01:42:47.830 --> 01:42:51.880
I was only one inch longer and reach on my last opponent.

1790
01:42:52.120 --> 01:42:56.980
My next opponent is taller than me by about one and a half note by one and a

1791
01:42:56.981 --> 01:42:59.770
half.
Yeah.
Is it one and a half or 11 and a half inches?

1792
01:43:00.160 --> 01:43:05.100
It's likely that her reach is longer or same as mine.
So she,

1793
01:43:05.160 --> 01:43:09.540
so that shoots that out of the sky.
Her name is Ashley Evans Smith.

1794
01:43:10.300 --> 01:43:12.550
Uh,
wait sir.
Okay.

1795
01:43:12.551 --> 01:43:17.350
So then she had me search this video right here with the last,
this woman,

1796
01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:22.060
my last opponent thought was Veronica Roth and houser.

1797
01:43:22.630 --> 01:43:26.710
She is about six feet.
She knocked out my Ashley,

1798
01:43:26.890 --> 01:43:29.980
the girl I'm about to fight in five seconds through either.

1799
01:43:29.981 --> 01:43:31.930
It was like a five second knockout.
Uh,

1800
01:43:32.170 --> 01:43:34.870
it was the quickest knockout in women's MMA history.

1801
01:43:34.871 --> 01:43:39.871
Her bone structure is greater than like 90% of the fighter female fighters out

1802
01:43:40.661 --> 01:43:42.820
there yet nobody is complaining about it.

1803
01:43:43.420 --> 01:43:45.700
The key thing is they will probably bring up safety,

1804
01:43:45.701 --> 01:43:49.060
the safety of female fighters.
If safety is the issue,

1805
01:43:49.120 --> 01:43:52.370
then why not bar cisgendered females over five 11

1806
01:43:52.370 --> 01:43:55.460
<v 4>or have reached restrictions?
Okay.
First of all,</v>

1807
01:43:55.461 --> 01:43:58.250
there's a lot of stuff going on there.
First,

1808
01:43:58.251 --> 01:44:00.800
I never said anything about her or reach.
It's inconsequential.

1809
01:44:00.801 --> 01:44:04.640
You win your way in.
You know,
it certainly helps to have a long reach,

1810
01:44:04.641 --> 01:44:05.151
but you know,

1811
01:44:05.151 --> 01:44:08.210
it also helps be shorter and stockier if you use certain techniques.

1812
01:44:08.520 --> 01:44:12.410
I have some are Paul Harris style.
Here's the thing about bone density.

1813
01:44:12.800 --> 01:44:16.370
Estrogen is what actually causes bone density,
right?
Causes bone growth.

1814
01:44:16.371 --> 01:44:20.420
It's not testosterone.
Men convert testosterone peripherally to estrogen.

1815
01:44:20.421 --> 01:44:25.421
This is all coming from a doctor who responded as doctor Ramona cruet sit a MD

1816
01:44:27.171 --> 01:44:31.640
and is my friend Steph,
Steph Daniels,
Aka Crooklyn.
Um,

1817
01:44:31.850 --> 01:44:35.960
put this a article on a bloody elbow,
which is an MMA website.

1818
01:44:35.961 --> 01:44:37.250
I'll cut this worthy.

1819
01:44:37.570 --> 01:44:42.530
This doctor was detailing advantages that a male to female transgender would

1820
01:44:42.531 --> 01:44:47.531
have because the information that is available online is very biased in a lot of

1821
01:44:47.991 --> 01:44:48.410
ways.

1822
01:44:48.410 --> 01:44:52.490
And the information is coming from people that are supporting transgender women

1823
01:44:52.491 --> 01:44:56.750
competing against,
against cis women as he will.
Um,

1824
01:44:56.810 --> 01:45:01.640
so he,
so he have a man who was on a hormonal blockers to block testosterone,

1825
01:45:01.641 --> 01:45:02.930
but it's now taking estrogen,

1826
01:45:02.931 --> 01:45:07.820
which is going to prevent osteoporosis ostial process.
That's how I say it.

1827
01:45:07.821 --> 01:45:12.380
Right.
Um,
so there wouldn't be a great percentage of bone density loss per se.

1828
01:45:12.500 --> 01:45:16.640
Males have a higher bone density and higher massive skeletons than females.

1829
01:45:16.820 --> 01:45:19.970
And it takes a long time for that to diminish.
Typically,

1830
01:45:19.971 --> 01:45:24.971
you're looking at 15 years after androgen suppression and Srs to really start to

1831
01:45:27.081 --> 01:45:29.810
see significant changes in bone density.
So right there,

1832
01:45:29.811 --> 01:45:34.690
this doctor saying that she has a male bone structure.
Yeah.
We'll,

1833
01:45:34.700 --> 01:45:39.680
we may also have,
so we have to cite his research on that somehow.
Yeah,

1834
01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:40.610
you're right.
You're right.

1835
01:45:40.640 --> 01:45:45.050
But what we sh w where you're showing at least is one person who's an expert in

1836
01:45:45.051 --> 01:45:49.550
the field,
a board certified endocrinologist who's telling you that no,

1837
01:45:49.730 --> 01:45:52.580
this is not true.
And that this bone density issue,

1838
01:45:52.581 --> 01:45:57.200
it takes more than 1515 years and it's a significant advantage that he would

1839
01:45:57.201 --> 01:46:02.201
enjoy or male to female would enjoy once she became a shitty right over other

1840
01:46:02.241 --> 01:46:03.160
CIS females.

1841
01:46:03.290 --> 01:46:07.280
Her testosterone levels are more than likely in the normal female range.

1842
01:46:07.281 --> 01:46:10.910
Since her adrenals are the primary source for it.
Now,
without seeing her labs,

1843
01:46:10.911 --> 01:46:14.600
it's hard to say for certain.
How are they maintaining her levels?

1844
01:46:14.601 --> 01:46:19.490
Are they keeping them at a very high end or the low end and are her normal

1845
01:46:19.491 --> 01:46:23.270
ranges for those value?
Uh,
there are a huge normal ranges for those values.

1846
01:46:23.480 --> 01:46:28.080
So it's since you're dealing with endogenous or exogenous,

1847
01:46:28.220 --> 01:46:28.800
is that what you saying?

1848
01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:32.600
How do you say it when it's a artificial hormones that you're inserting in your

1849
01:46:32.601 --> 01:46:35.150
system,
whatever,
your,
your,
your engineering,

1850
01:46:35.151 --> 01:46:38.460
your hormone levels instead of letting your end to consistent to that.
Right.

1851
01:46:38.510 --> 01:46:42.530
So it's very debatable.
Like how,
what are the levels and how,
how it,

1852
01:46:42.531 --> 01:46:45.480
how come nobody asked for her levels have that.
They don't,
I'm sure they do.

1853
01:46:45.670 --> 01:46:50.220
They do.
Especially now,
she developed fully into a male with a normal musculature

1854
01:46:50.220 --> 01:46:51.060
<v 5>and bone structure.
She,</v>

1855
01:46:51.070 --> 01:46:55.140
she didn't undergo hormone therapy and surgery until she was fully developed as

1856
01:46:55.141 --> 01:46:59.720
compared to someone who completes therapy and surgery in there,
uh,

1857
01:46:59.760 --> 01:47:02.400
adolescents and or era,
early adulthood.
Right.

1858
01:47:02.401 --> 01:47:05.550
Men are completely developed by the age of 22 and she didn't start a therapy

1859
01:47:05.551 --> 01:47:07.860
until several years later than that.
Right.

1860
01:47:08.010 --> 01:47:11.130
So there's also other things that she goes over,

1861
01:47:11.610 --> 01:47:16.520
different reasons,
several different,
and we don't have to continue,
uh,

1862
01:47:16.620 --> 01:47:17.431
going into it.

1863
01:47:17.431 --> 01:47:21.750
But it's a very difficult because of course I'm coming to it from,

1864
01:47:22.290 --> 01:47:25.530
I'm a man,
so I should be treated like a man,
whether you like it or not,

1865
01:47:25.700 --> 01:47:29.100
I'm coming to it as someone who's supporting transgender and supporting the idea

1866
01:47:29.101 --> 01:47:33.120
of gender identity life.
Yes.
It's like,
of course I have to understand that.

1867
01:47:33.150 --> 01:47:34.020
You know,
I,

1868
01:47:34.230 --> 01:47:37.350
I personally don't understand why she didn't disclose because I would have,

1869
01:47:37.710 --> 01:47:40.860
so I don't think probably it's the same reason why she was deceptive in that

1870
01:47:40.861 --> 01:47:43.880
letter that she wrote to you about the things that I said.
I didn't say anything.

1871
01:47:44.060 --> 01:47:46.750
I didn't dis about bone structure.
Right.

1872
01:47:46.770 --> 01:47:48.780
I think she has a higher bone structure that most females,

1873
01:47:49.110 --> 01:47:51.720
I didn't disagree about the strength of her muscles.
I don't know what she's,

1874
01:47:51.900 --> 01:47:53.670
I look at her,
she's a big woman.

1875
01:47:53.760 --> 01:47:56.430
It's a big strong woman and she man handles girls in the cage.

1876
01:47:56.431 --> 01:47:57.630
She beats the shit out of them.
Right.

1877
01:47:57.780 --> 01:48:02.070
And when I found out that she used to be a man,
I go,
well that's what I'm seeing.

1878
01:48:02.340 --> 01:48:05.820
That's what I'm seeing.
I'm seeing,
I'm seeing a ridiculous strength advantage.

1879
01:48:06.510 --> 01:48:10.380
And the others girls are strong as shit.
No doubt.
And there's hobby girls,

1880
01:48:10.381 --> 01:48:14.460
they could beat her ass.
No doubt.
There's girls like Cyborg that you know,
Shit,

1881
01:48:14.461 --> 01:48:17.300
a lot of guys wouldn't want to fuck with their professional fighters when want

1882
01:48:17.301 --> 01:48:18.180
to fuck with Cyborg.

1883
01:48:18.450 --> 01:48:22.680
But then there's also the Cyborg got pop doing steroids herself.
You know,

1884
01:48:22.710 --> 01:48:26.120
she actually inserted some male hormones in your own system.
Right.

1885
01:48:26.310 --> 01:48:30.960
My point is if you do want to do something like this,
first of all,

1886
01:48:30.961 --> 01:48:34.350
a disclosure is fucking huge and B,

1887
01:48:34.470 --> 01:48:39.360
you need to be tested and you need to be tested like across the board on

1888
01:48:39.361 --> 01:48:43.520
everything.
You can't just be saying,
I have low bone density and sang,

1889
01:48:43.521 --> 01:48:47.350
I have low testosterone.
We need to know what the fuck is really going on.
Right.

1890
01:48:47.450 --> 01:48:50.540
And,
and it has to be disclosed if people want to compete against you.

1891
01:48:50.820 --> 01:48:53.490
And I'm sure cyborg would have no problem beating the shit out of that check.

1892
01:48:53.670 --> 01:48:57.060
Well,
the thing is,
I think Fallon comes to it with,
no,

1893
01:48:57.360 --> 01:48:59.400
she's like the first person to ever do this.

1894
01:48:59.520 --> 01:49:03.320
So there's a lot of stuff going on there,
right.
So you know,
it is,
it is.

1895
01:49:03.321 --> 01:49:06.870
It's a very touchy situation because may she just feels like a woman,

1896
01:49:06.871 --> 01:49:09.660
so she feels like I'm a woman.
I don't need to discuss this.

1897
01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:13.470
But she started fighting as well.
Now it's different.
I have to tell you,

1898
01:49:13.500 --> 01:49:16.260
obviously it's out in the open.
People know about it.

1899
01:49:16.290 --> 01:49:19.680
She has a huge opportunity right now to actually open it up for lots more

1900
01:49:19.681 --> 01:49:23.100
transgender fighters and figure out how we can change it.

1901
01:49:23.610 --> 01:49:24.840
How do we change this?

1902
01:49:24.841 --> 01:49:29.430
So it is cool for you to fight and everybody feels cool about it,
right?
Yeah.

1903
01:49:29.460 --> 01:49:32.910
How do we do that now?
That's a real good question.
We'll lease now.

1904
01:49:32.911 --> 01:49:33.721
It's out in the open.

1905
01:49:33.721 --> 01:49:37.290
So now I have no problem with anybody who chooses to compete against her now

1906
01:49:37.291 --> 01:49:40.080
just so I don't have any problem with a woman who chooses to compete against
men.

1907
01:49:40.110 --> 01:49:41.760
But that's awesome that you just said that.

1908
01:49:41.790 --> 01:49:44.160
That's like huge for trans people did for you to say,

1909
01:49:44.161 --> 01:49:46.260
I don't have a problem with it,
but how do we do it then?

1910
01:49:46.260 --> 01:49:50.530
It's fair because sports is all about fair.
It is.

1911
01:49:50.531 --> 01:49:52.450
It's all about there.
I don't care what's not,

1912
01:49:52.480 --> 01:49:56.350
but this is not just a regular sport,
right?
It puts your health on point.

1913
01:49:56.590 --> 01:50:00.300
I understand.
The reality is she's giving these girls concussions.
Yes.
And the,

1914
01:50:00.301 --> 01:50:04.400
the reality of combat sports is not like losing a soccer game.
You know?

1915
01:50:04.690 --> 01:50:06.570
It's a strange difference.
A totally different sport.

1916
01:50:07.360 --> 01:50:09.610
That's why I get so adamant about right.

1917
01:50:09.790 --> 01:50:13.420
The reason why she's so defensive about it is she's got to realize that she

1918
01:50:13.421 --> 01:50:17.050
heard those girls.
She knows she actually physically them up,

1919
01:50:17.200 --> 01:50:22.090
fuck four or five of them up in the first round and on the first real quick beat

1920
01:50:22.091 --> 01:50:25.570
downs,
brutal beat downs.
She didn't take any damage at all in those fights.

1921
01:50:26.230 --> 01:50:29.280
One fight,
which one girl hit her with a couple of punches,
boxing.

1922
01:50:29.290 --> 01:50:31.600
She did pretty good and she's got her on the ground and put her fucking shit.

1923
01:50:31.600 --> 01:50:33.340
Getting any credit for it.
I mean again,

1924
01:50:33.341 --> 01:50:36.280
that you're going to credit for her for her fighting skills though there.
Okay.

1925
01:50:36.510 --> 01:50:40.090
I know what good fighting skills look like.
I mean,
she's a decent competitor.

1926
01:50:40.091 --> 01:50:42.670
You're saying basically that's all come.
She's manhandling them.

1927
01:50:42.730 --> 01:50:45.730
That comes from man handling.
It doesn't come from her.
That's what I'm seeing.

1928
01:50:45.760 --> 01:50:49.670
What I'm seeing is a huge strength advantage.
I'm not,

1929
01:50:49.990 --> 01:50:52.720
and that happens with men and that happens with women too.

1930
01:50:52.900 --> 01:50:56.950
There's women that can fucking rag doll chicks and kicked their ass on cis
women.

1931
01:50:56.980 --> 01:51:00.640
As you were getting your tee shirt.
I'll wear it.

1932
01:51:01.330 --> 01:51:05.900
I get that.
But,
but that's natural when you're,

1933
01:51:05.920 --> 01:51:07.240
you're engineering it,

1934
01:51:07.300 --> 01:51:10.750
of course people are going to be upset when you're engineering designing,

1935
01:51:10.930 --> 01:51:14.710
especially when you listen to this doctor say it takes 15 fucking years before

1936
01:51:14.711 --> 01:51:18.040
there's any change at all and that you will have the bone density of a man.

1937
01:51:18.250 --> 01:51:21.280
I mean this is a board certified endocrinologist who has no stake in the game,

1938
01:51:21.400 --> 01:51:24.520
not someone who's a gender reassignment doctor,

1939
01:51:24.521 --> 01:51:29.260
which is what I've read all across the board,
positive in defense of this.

1940
01:51:29.350 --> 01:51:31.990
It's all been people who are working in that industry.

1941
01:51:32.260 --> 01:51:36.940
Often people who have a vested interest in supporting the idea that transgender

1942
01:51:36.941 --> 01:51:41.440
female has no advantages.
Of course they do.
But you can't.
That's fucked up.

1943
01:51:41.441 --> 01:51:44.800
You shouldn't be a,
I agree with you on that.
It's about facts.

1944
01:51:45.430 --> 01:51:49.990
You have to always look at the facts and if you have actual medical stuff there

1945
01:51:49.991 --> 01:51:53.740
that says that this person has an advantage over that,
you cannot ignore it.

1946
01:51:53.770 --> 01:51:58.420
It's not being anti transgender.
It's not.
Do you know who,
um,
the,
the,

1947
01:51:58.630 --> 01:52:02.110
you know and Renee Richards is,
yeah,
I'm sure it's for folks who don't know.

1948
01:52:02.410 --> 01:52:06.670
Renee Richards was,
you know,
basically just a regular tennis player.
Right.

1949
01:52:06.880 --> 01:52:11.880
I'm not that good as a man became a woman kicked and was a mother fucker.

1950
01:52:13.570 --> 01:52:17.020
Okay.
She was so good.
This is way back in the day.

1951
01:52:17.021 --> 01:52:21.370
Women Trans Women had a massive head start on people like,
yes.

1952
01:52:21.910 --> 01:52:26.910
She was actually barred from playing as a woman in the u s open in 1976 76

1953
01:52:28.660 --> 01:52:31.950
unless she submitted two chromosome will task day.
Right.

1954
01:52:32.080 --> 01:52:35.770
She sued the United States Tennis Association in [inaudible] 77 she won the

1955
01:52:35.771 --> 01:52:39.550
right to play as a woman without submitting to any testing and she played

1956
01:52:39.551 --> 01:52:43.360
between 77 and 81.
She was ranked as high as 20th overall.

1957
01:52:43.630 --> 01:52:46.070
And our highest ranking,
uh,
was a,
the end

1958
01:52:46.070 --> 01:52:49.140
<v 3>of her last year in 77 was 20 seconds.</v>

1959
01:52:49.400 --> 01:52:53.790
She was a 20th and 20 seconds.
Pretty fucking good.
I mean it's,

1960
01:52:54.020 --> 01:52:57.900
it's really an error.
Yeah.
Talia is a pioneer.
She dominated bitches that,

1961
01:52:57.920 --> 01:53:01.460
you know what,
like we to break through shit,
we gotta break through shit.

1962
01:53:01.870 --> 01:53:05.960
All right.
Listen,
she wasn't fucking hurting anybody.
I different point.

1963
01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:09.980
I totally get your point and I think it's valid.
My anger about it,
my,

1964
01:53:10.040 --> 01:53:13.370
my distrust in the FFA,
there's a several,
one,

1965
01:53:13.400 --> 01:53:18.020
the lack of disclosure initially right to inbreeding her very thing where she's

1966
01:53:18.080 --> 01:53:22.330
deceptive in her email and she says a bunch of things that I didn't say that's,

1967
01:53:22.550 --> 01:53:25.610
that shows me the way her mind works.
That's a problem.

1968
01:53:25.730 --> 01:53:28.280
That's not a good representative of a trans woman.

1969
01:53:28.580 --> 01:53:32.360
And then there's also the issue of what the sport entails.

1970
01:53:32.390 --> 01:53:37.390
It entails doing violence as quickly as possible and that one 10th of a second

1971
01:53:37.580 --> 01:53:41.170
advantage and reaction time is goddamn gigantic shirts,

1972
01:53:41.370 --> 01:53:43.940
God damn gigantic.
And you know,

1973
01:53:43.941 --> 01:53:48.050
there needs to be studies done as to whether you become a transgender woman.

1974
01:53:48.051 --> 01:53:53.050
When does that advantage that way?
Exactly.
Does it ever go is an imprinted right?

1975
01:53:53.070 --> 01:53:57.710
Because the issue of imprinting skills as a man and then transitioning to a

1976
01:53:57.711 --> 01:54:02.210
transgender woman,
Huh?
There's,
this is not a cut and dry issue.
It's very,

1977
01:54:02.570 --> 01:54:03.530
very complex issue.

1978
01:54:03.650 --> 01:54:08.650
But what's important is it has nothing to do with heart and love and has nothing

1979
01:54:09.051 --> 01:54:13.360
to do with being nice to people is nothing to do my thing.
Mom,

1980
01:54:13.370 --> 01:54:17.840
coming from a purely as a a martial arts expert and be a defender of real women,

1981
01:54:18.220 --> 01:54:22.490
a defender of real women who gets stuck in a situation where someone might have

1982
01:54:22.491 --> 01:54:26.570
a real fucking mechanical,
physical bone structure advantage,

1983
01:54:26.660 --> 01:54:28.760
bone density advantage,
testosterone.

1984
01:54:28.761 --> 01:54:33.130
Advent is a lot of variables that could really lead to them getting concussed

1985
01:54:33.131 --> 01:54:36.920
flow.
ACMA,
not real land that CIS gender.
When I,
by the way,

1986
01:54:36.921 --> 01:54:41.290
I remember using rail women freaks people out just to let you know,
I'm,

1987
01:54:41.420 --> 01:54:45.110
I'm helping your hair,
but really what it comes down to,

1988
01:54:45.111 --> 01:54:48.620
I think it's safety.
Let's get down to the real issue,

1989
01:54:50.200 --> 01:54:54.830
especially in a sport that you could kill somebody.
Yes,
and so that is a valid,

1990
01:54:55.010 --> 01:54:57.140
that is a valid point I think coming from you.

1991
01:54:57.141 --> 01:55:01.550
And I'm not saying that I say it's right what you're saying or it's wrong what

1992
01:55:01.551 --> 01:55:01.971
you're saying.

1993
01:55:01.971 --> 01:55:05.720
I think it's valid what you're saying and I think we need to figure out how to

1994
01:55:05.721 --> 01:55:08.930
make this work for everybody.
Is it possible?
I don't know.

1995
01:55:08.960 --> 01:55:12.220
I has the reach make a difference.
It's not reach her.

1996
01:55:12.221 --> 01:55:14.030
She said that that's horse shit.

1997
01:55:14.240 --> 01:55:17.780
[inaudible] it can be the same height,
the same.

1998
01:55:18.020 --> 01:55:22.130
It doesn't matter because you're weighing in,
right?
It's all about the punch,

1999
01:55:22.131 --> 01:55:25.910
the contact.
It's about the mechanical structure of the male frame.

2000
01:55:26.030 --> 01:55:29.300
It's about the,
the advantage in reaction time.

2001
01:55:29.360 --> 01:55:32.990
It's about the imprinting of skills as a male for,
you know,

2002
01:55:33.170 --> 01:55:38.020
20 plus years and then transitioning to a female.
There's a lot of issues,
right?

2003
01:55:38.210 --> 01:55:38.840
What,

2004
01:55:38.840 --> 01:55:43.840
what is huge for me to relay is that I am very to

2005
01:55:44.160 --> 01:55:48.300
<v 5>whatever anyone's gender identity is and I make no judgments on that.</v>

2006
01:55:48.510 --> 01:55:53.300
If it had nothing to do with sport and especially my sport of martial arts and

2007
01:55:53.340 --> 01:55:56.460
where I'm an expert,
I understand.
I've taught it.

2008
01:55:56.550 --> 01:56:00.570
I know I've done it my whole life.
I understand the advantages and they're giant.

2009
01:56:00.840 --> 01:56:04.170
You know,
I've trained with world champion women,
right?
You know,
and you,

2010
01:56:04.171 --> 01:56:05.130
you could tell the difference.

2011
01:56:05.131 --> 01:56:07.050
Should a world champion man in a world champion women,

2012
01:56:07.080 --> 01:56:08.760
I'm sure if they're really high level,

2013
01:56:08.970 --> 01:56:12.360
there's just a freak advantage that a man has.
Right.
And it doesn't go away.

2014
01:56:12.361 --> 01:56:15.810
That easy,
man just doesn't.
Right.
And some women can counteract that.

2015
01:56:15.811 --> 01:56:17.400
Like a woman like Rhonda Rousey,

2016
01:56:17.520 --> 01:56:21.100
she's his woman as you get and she'll fuck man up legit.
You know,

2017
01:56:21.120 --> 01:56:24.420
like world champion men.
She can arm bar then she's legit.

2018
01:56:24.900 --> 01:56:26.270
But it doesn't mean that it's,

2019
01:56:26.350 --> 01:56:29.850
it's okay trying to make it a political statement at this point.

2020
01:56:29.910 --> 01:56:31.790
It's a political statement clearly,

2021
01:56:31.860 --> 01:56:35.940
which is not actually fair to do in a sport that could kill somebody.

2022
01:56:35.941 --> 01:56:39.240
And what's fucked is I support the political statement side.
Of course you do.

2023
01:56:39.241 --> 01:56:41.650
That's,
I know that about you.
That's what's really fun to be on.

2024
01:56:41.651 --> 01:56:45.400
Your fucking showed it.
You're very cool with shit like that.
But I can't,

2025
01:56:46.590 --> 01:56:49.280
I can't support that because cis women are going to get fucked.

2026
01:56:50.770 --> 01:56:53.490
I mean that's already all right.
Anyway.
Not all of them.
Yeah,

2027
01:56:53.491 --> 01:56:57.440
the everyone's getting fucked up anyway.
Not all of them obviously,
but do,

2028
01:56:57.510 --> 01:56:58.231
I've raced.
Okay,

2029
01:56:58.231 --> 01:57:01.970
so I have this question and because every single one of the cisgender women,
uh,

2030
01:57:02.160 --> 01:57:05.640
fighters have a problem with fallen a huge percentage.

2031
01:57:05.790 --> 01:57:08.400
I don't know if every one I couldn't,
I haven't spoke to every one of them,

2032
01:57:08.401 --> 01:57:11.940
but I've spoke to several and I was in private who don't even want to discuss.

2033
01:57:11.940 --> 01:57:15.870
It was a chain of expletives.

2034
01:57:15.960 --> 01:57:19.620
Fuck that.
And one of the things that they always use is man hands.

2035
01:57:19.740 --> 01:57:23.670
These are the size of hands.
If you have a ball peen hammer and a big nail,

2036
01:57:23.671 --> 01:57:25.260
it's really hard to drive that Neylon.

2037
01:57:25.410 --> 01:57:29.700
If you've got to fucking sledgehammer and the same size nail you boom.

2038
01:57:29.701 --> 01:57:30.600
And it goes right in.

2039
01:57:30.900 --> 01:57:35.900
There's a weight advantage to the size of a hand that makes a big difference but

2040
01:57:37.070 --> 01:57:41.130
entered.
Would it be she's not.
I know,
but that's the problem.

2041
01:57:41.340 --> 01:57:43.590
The problem is she's not.
And George Foreman,

2042
01:57:43.591 --> 01:57:46.520
if you gave George Short form and female hormones and put them in a dress,
right,

2043
01:57:46.610 --> 01:57:50.070
he would fuck up.
Every woman on the planet is handled.

2044
01:57:50.190 --> 01:57:54.510
Like don't change your and your hands.
Don't change it.
Don't change.

2045
01:57:54.610 --> 01:57:58.840
Neither is your jaw actually to your ability to take a punch.
I mean,

2046
01:57:58.890 --> 01:58:02.000
changing from male to a one K,
right?
You're trying to,

2047
01:58:02.100 --> 01:58:06.970
your mad face became all like cro.
Magnon Matt,
you liked it though

2048
01:58:09.220 --> 01:58:11.490
with a beard.
That's,
you know,

2049
01:58:11.491 --> 01:58:14.280
and when in expressing something,

2050
01:58:14.281 --> 01:58:18.210
whether it's a on a podcast or expressing something in a tweet or a blog,

2051
01:58:18.700 --> 01:58:22.650
some the full idea sometimes always don't get across.
You know,

2052
01:58:22.651 --> 01:58:26.190
and I've been accused across the board about this and being transphobia,

2053
01:58:26.580 --> 01:58:31.050
transphobic,
you're not actually,
well I think it's really,
it's,
it's,
it's normal.

2054
01:58:31.080 --> 01:58:34.830
It's natural for someone who immediately point the finger and say that.

2055
01:58:35.120 --> 01:58:38.730
But it's not fair to the subject because the subject is very intense.

2056
01:58:38.970 --> 01:58:42.520
But you're not transfer.
Not,
I'll say it on air now.
You're not transphobic,

2057
01:58:42.570 --> 01:58:47.140
but I'm not anything phobic.
Yeah,
you're not.
No,
you're not homophobic,
but,

2058
01:58:47.380 --> 01:58:49.810
but I'll call people on their shit.
That's totally different.

2059
01:58:50.080 --> 01:58:53.830
And I do the same thing.
It's completely different.
Well,
I,
I,
like I said,

2060
01:58:53.831 --> 01:58:57.860
I'm friends with one of the girls that she fought this cis gendered female who

2061
01:58:57.861 --> 01:59:01.180
got the fuck beat out of her and you know,
she was like,
Jesus Christ,

2062
01:59:01.181 --> 01:59:03.460
I'm getting manhandled here.
I mean,
that's how she described it.

2063
01:59:03.461 --> 01:59:05.560
She didn't even feel like it wasn't an echo fight.

2064
01:59:05.610 --> 01:59:08.830
She got rag the rag dolls when you just like fucking just pull shit across

2065
01:59:09.160 --> 01:59:12.800
somebody like right when someone gets ragdolled.
Right.
Means that,
you know,

2066
01:59:12.801 --> 01:59:16.960
like if you fight,
if I fought Brock Lesnar,
I get ragdolled.
Right.
It's water.

2067
01:59:17.600 --> 01:59:18.730
Yeah.
I mean,
you know,

2068
01:59:18.731 --> 01:59:21.610
I'm not saying that the difference between her and a female is probably far less

2069
01:59:21.611 --> 01:59:22.960
than me and Brock Lesnar,

2070
01:59:23.310 --> 01:59:26.110
he could probably ragdolled me easier than she was rag dolling these women here

2071
01:59:26.440 --> 01:59:27.610
in her same weight class.

2072
01:59:27.611 --> 01:59:30.940
But there's an advantage and it needs to be discussed and it needs to be

2073
01:59:30.941 --> 01:59:35.080
something that's fully explore and maybe she's the pioneer of this flourishes

2074
01:59:35.170 --> 01:59:36.210
and maybe they,
you know,

2075
01:59:36.250 --> 01:59:40.000
we'll figure out a way to add something that alleviates a certain amount of bone

2076
01:59:40.001 --> 01:59:43.960
density.
Maybe they'll figure out how to do something that changes the mechanical

2077
01:59:43.961 --> 01:59:46.810
advantage that a man has a promotional thing.

2078
01:59:46.840 --> 01:59:50.830
Maybe we have to understand that she has to fight the people that want to fight

2079
01:59:50.831 --> 01:59:55.170
her by her.
They have that.
They have that option right now to say,
yeah,

2080
01:59:55.171 --> 01:59:56.800
I want to fight her,
or I don't want to fight her,

2081
01:59:56.801 --> 01:59:59.410
and then we have to figure out how that's gonna play into this situation.

2082
01:59:59.440 --> 02:00:03.750
And you know what?
They're also compete transgender division that may,
no,

2083
02:00:03.751 --> 02:00:06.680
that's very cool.
Transgender women,
there's plenty of trans women.

2084
02:00:08.080 --> 02:00:11.410
That's a great idea.
That's a super awesome,
I like that idea.

2085
02:00:11.470 --> 02:00:13.210
That leaves no controversy at all.

2086
02:00:13.211 --> 02:00:14.530
I don't think anybody would have a problem with it.

2087
02:00:15.340 --> 02:00:16.510
You wouldn't hear a peep out of me.

2088
02:00:16.511 --> 02:00:20.350
I would have no problem with it now because it's a fair fight now.
Yes,
exactly.

2089
02:00:20.380 --> 02:00:22.080
And I don't think,
you know,

2090
02:00:22.180 --> 02:00:27.180
I don't think there's anything wrong with the idea if it's vetted out and found

2091
02:00:28.241 --> 02:00:31.630
to be a hundred percent safe.
Right.
But I have looked at it objectively.

2092
02:00:31.631 --> 02:00:32.800
I've looked at the research.

2093
02:00:33.100 --> 02:00:35.980
I've been told by all these progressive people that are like,
you know,

2094
02:00:35.981 --> 02:00:37.630
hey there's real science been done on this.

2095
02:00:37.810 --> 02:00:41.620
I looked at that real science and it's horse shit.
There's not real science.

2096
02:00:41.730 --> 02:00:46.730
It's real science that's set up to give confirmation bias to the idea that as

2097
02:00:48.191 --> 02:00:51.340
soon as someone is it tanes sexual reassignment surgery,

2098
02:00:51.370 --> 02:00:56.290
then they're immediately,
they not just identify as that sex but sex physiologic.

2099
02:00:56.291 --> 02:00:57.940
Right.
And it's simply not true.
It's not true.

2100
02:00:57.950 --> 02:01:01.570
I'll be the first to tell you that I have female frame still and you cannot

2101
02:01:01.571 --> 02:01:06.310
change your DNA that is there.
My frame is still female.

2102
02:01:06.580 --> 02:01:09.910
It is.
I can put as much bulk as I want to put it on my body.

2103
02:01:09.911 --> 02:01:12.490
I still have and you know when I,
I used to be a lot bigger.

2104
02:01:12.490 --> 02:01:16.140
I was like oh getting into the whole body building thing and then all I,

2105
02:01:16.240 --> 02:01:20.740
I hurt all the time cause my little frame underneath that was like fuck you.

2106
02:01:20.741 --> 02:01:22.810
What is the,
what's the heaviest you've ever got a,

2107
02:01:22.811 --> 02:01:26.830
I got about 185 and I was just like,
my shoulders are like this.

2108
02:01:26.831 --> 02:01:30.800
I had no neck dude.
I was like,
Oh,
oh as I,
ah,
I'm over this shit man.

2109
02:01:30.801 --> 02:01:33.160
And I traveled like mad so I couldn't go to the gym all the time.

2110
02:01:33.161 --> 02:01:35.860
I my eating suck.
And so like I know it wasn't comfortable.

2111
02:01:36.010 --> 02:01:39.770
My frame underneath my woman frame.
What's going?
You fucking bitch.

2112
02:01:39.771 --> 02:01:43.370
I get that shit off.
How much did you weigh as a woman?
Oh,
I was small.

2113
02:01:43.371 --> 02:01:46.870
Did I was 110 whoa.

2114
02:01:47.430 --> 02:01:51.950
You put on 75 pounds of muscle it on day.

2115
02:01:51.960 --> 02:01:53.950
I think a 75 steaks.

2116
02:01:56.360 --> 02:02:01.220
One pound,
one of those crazy gym fees.

2117
02:02:01.221 --> 02:02:05.990
75 stay packed it up dude.
Like I was crazy.
When you look at it that way,

2118
02:02:06.230 --> 02:02:10.290
75 20 grows.
That's a lot of meat you put on those.
What do you weigh now?

2119
02:02:10.490 --> 02:02:13.870
Now I weigh about one 60 you felt like that's like,
oh,
I'm at my weight.

2120
02:02:14.750 --> 02:02:18.500
25 pounds even feel so Aussie up.

2121
02:02:19.540 --> 02:02:22.850
Shit hurts.
What were you doing?

2122
02:02:22.851 --> 02:02:26.110
You know a lot of power lifting heavy weights,
dude.

2123
02:02:26.120 --> 02:02:30.660
Like every kind of heavyweight you could imagine.
Yeah.
Deadlifts,
bench press,

2124
02:02:30.680 --> 02:02:34.490
like all of them.
Big heavyweight that I'm sure changed your frame a little bit.

2125
02:02:34.510 --> 02:02:37.430
Yeah,
thank you.
Not just your,
your bone structure too.

2126
02:02:37.431 --> 02:02:41.450
I bet that made your bone structure loved dance.
I,
but that's also a lot of what,

2127
02:02:41.451 --> 02:02:43.510
how your head got thicker.
Totally.

2128
02:02:44.750 --> 02:02:49.750
My nose grew power lifting and especially power lifting under the influence of

2129
02:02:49.881 --> 02:02:54.050
testosterone.
That's a,
that's a big one for everything.
Denser.

2130
02:02:54.230 --> 02:02:58.730
They say a certain amount of it is actually really important for old people to

2131
02:02:58.731 --> 02:03:03.140
avoid loss of bone density.
Men and women.
I believe that.
Totally.
Yeah.

2132
02:03:03.170 --> 02:03:06.800
Those power lifting movements like dead lifts and I think they're awesome.

2133
02:03:06.801 --> 02:03:09.530
I still do that,
but more than I like crossfit,
he gone away.

2134
02:03:09.531 --> 02:03:14.160
Not so much like that going to the gym.
Right,
right,
right.
What crossfit he,

2135
02:03:14.161 --> 02:03:17.660
they get a little wacky to now.
They're totally,
those people get bananas.

2136
02:03:17.970 --> 02:03:18.591
I have a buddy,

2137
02:03:18.591 --> 02:03:22.250
he's got a blown back now from crossfit and I was trying to warn them,
you know,

2138
02:03:22.251 --> 02:03:26.120
it's like chill out.
My trainer says that when you do all those reps,

2139
02:03:26.121 --> 02:03:27.680
but those power lifting exercises,

2140
02:03:27.930 --> 02:03:31.190
it was kinda dangerous yet think are crazy call ups.

2141
02:03:31.191 --> 02:03:33.760
They do the w o o d [inaudible].

2142
02:03:34.490 --> 02:03:37.370
She opened a crossfit gym and then like totally obsessed with their crossfit and

2143
02:03:37.371 --> 02:03:40.730
I go every once in a while and it's all cool,
but it's sexy.
It's insane.

2144
02:03:40.790 --> 02:03:45.620
I think those chicks are sexy as far as their bodies look phenomenal.
Phenomenal.

2145
02:03:45.740 --> 02:03:49.640
Really strong,
powerful chicks that look like chalk on there head.

2146
02:03:49.650 --> 02:03:52.590
They totally are fucking amazing.
So they have

2147
02:03:54.980 --> 02:03:58.890
like the squatters.
I should do a porn with crossfit chicks.
Oh yeah.

2148
02:03:58.970 --> 02:04:01.010
People would love to crossfit porn.
Yeah.

2149
02:04:01.070 --> 02:04:03.290
Crossfit would kick you out every fucking gym in the country.

2150
02:04:03.510 --> 02:04:05.290
So as soon as it goes to that true.

2151
02:04:05.990 --> 02:04:08.960
As soon as it goes national and big on the Internet,
they'd be like,

2152
02:04:08.961 --> 02:04:10.980
what the fuck,
Buck.
Yeah,
you're fucking it all up.

2153
02:04:12.870 --> 02:04:15.640
We've got a bunch of people that I've got the total wrong impression of Christ

2154
02:04:15.800 --> 02:04:19.760
now.
I think it's a sex club.
Yeah,

2155
02:04:19.761 --> 02:04:22.780
you go and squat and then just fucking,
I'm like,

2156
02:04:22.790 --> 02:04:26.660
those squats are really good for sex actually.
They are though,
right?

2157
02:04:27.320 --> 02:04:28.700
Nobody wants to have sex with frail people.

2158
02:04:29.990 --> 02:04:32.930
You don't want to have sex with someone and worry about breaking things.
Uh,
yeah.

2159
02:04:34.010 --> 02:04:36.140
So hopefully following is going to be cool about what we just go.

2160
02:04:37.530 --> 02:04:42.000
I want Fallon to know that I don't have no disrespect to her as a human being.

2161
02:04:42.001 --> 02:04:45.300
I believe that.
And if I knew her only as a trans woman,

2162
02:04:45.330 --> 02:04:47.750
we would be friendly as all.
Fuck.
I swear to God,

2163
02:04:48.270 --> 02:04:53.270
my issue lies only on the lack of disclosure and what I saw in those fights.

2164
02:04:54.030 --> 02:04:57.540
So how can she fix that?
Do you think?
Is there a way that she could sort of,
uh,

2165
02:04:57.900 --> 02:05:00.930
you know,
uh,
uh,
what's the word I'm looking for?
Like sort of,
uh,

2166
02:05:01.020 --> 02:05:02.660
bring herself back and,
and,

2167
02:05:02.720 --> 02:05:06.600
and people start having a little bit more respect for her in the,

2168
02:05:06.990 --> 02:05:11.200
in the MMA stuff,
or now the already lost her disc.
I don't know,

2169
02:05:11.310 --> 02:05:15.260
credit herself from that or I don't think anybody ever discredit themselves

2170
02:05:15.270 --> 02:05:18.720
forever.
I mean,
I think the biggest fuck ups you,

2171
02:05:18.721 --> 02:05:22.290
no one can come back from it if you're honest,
especially if you're honest.

2172
02:05:22.291 --> 02:05:23.760
But sometimes people aren't willing.

2173
02:05:23.761 --> 02:05:26.810
A lot of times if the community isn't willing to sort of give you,
yeah,

2174
02:05:26.940 --> 02:05:30.880
well she's gonna certainly face some resistance.
Yeah.

2175
02:05:30.910 --> 02:05:33.270
She certainly going to face resistance as far as opponents,

2176
02:05:33.600 --> 02:05:36.660
but at least now it's willing resistance.
It's people don't understand,

2177
02:05:36.661 --> 02:05:40.380
not resistance post,
you know,
post fight where they go,
wait a minute.

2178
02:05:40.381 --> 02:05:43.920
That used to be a guy,
right?
What the fuck?
What the fuck?
And then they get mad.

2179
02:05:43.921 --> 02:05:44.760
They're like,
Jesus Christ,

2180
02:05:44.761 --> 02:05:47.130
you have a concussion and they can't hear what they're hearing.

2181
02:05:47.131 --> 02:05:51.420
That used to be a guy,
of course,
that brings up all kinds of red flags.

2182
02:05:51.421 --> 02:05:54.360
You're like,
I'm not fighting a dude.
I'm like,
this is women's fighting,

2183
02:05:54.540 --> 02:05:57.150
but that's what now,
now that it's revealed,

2184
02:05:57.480 --> 02:05:59.070
I'm for anybody who wants to fight her.

2185
02:05:59.190 --> 02:06:02.040
I just think that if the commissions are going to be responsible about it,

2186
02:06:02.280 --> 02:06:04.960
there should be some sort of real protocol sentence,
right?

2187
02:06:05.130 --> 02:06:08.070
It should really be examined.
Bone density,
the whole nine yards,

2188
02:06:08.100 --> 02:06:12.150
everything should be examined and you should have more opinions than these

2189
02:06:12.510 --> 02:06:16.170
extremely biased gender reassignment doctors who are providing a lot of the

2190
02:06:16.171 --> 02:06:19.290
information that I've been reading online that people have been pointing to in

2191
02:06:19.291 --> 02:06:23.570
support of gender reassignment,
people being immediately recognized as cis Joe,

2192
02:06:23.571 --> 02:06:26.280
you know,
it's the same real woman category,
whatever.

2193
02:06:26.610 --> 02:06:31.230
I think once it's out there,
it's out there.
Now that it's out there,
hey,
you know,

2194
02:06:31.231 --> 02:06:35.010
if you choose to compete against her and you're a cis woman and he's got no

2195
02:06:35.011 --> 02:06:38.040
problem with it,
it's cool.
I'm free with you trying to ride bulls too.

2196
02:06:38.041 --> 02:06:39.930
I think that's way more ridiculous.

2197
02:06:41.360 --> 02:06:45.090
I'm free with you trying to fucking do flips on a BMX bike to whatever the fuck

2198
02:06:45.091 --> 02:06:49.170
you want,
but any kind of contact sport,
my Imac rugby or something like that.

2199
02:06:49.170 --> 02:06:49.440
What do you,

2200
02:06:49.440 --> 02:06:53.520
what do you think about if you want to do it as long as you know other and also

2201
02:06:53.521 --> 02:06:58.090
as long as the other teammates or people know that you are a transgender person,

2202
02:06:59.780 --> 02:07:00.870
it needs to be disclosed.

2203
02:07:00.900 --> 02:07:03.630
It needs to be disclosed and it really needs to be studied,

2204
02:07:03.631 --> 02:07:08.280
objective Lee and scientifically without any sort of bias.

2205
02:07:08.340 --> 02:07:10.500
So we can really look at the actual numbers,

2206
02:07:10.501 --> 02:07:14.970
not just in one person but on several people looking on that side,
right?
Yeah.

2207
02:07:14.971 --> 02:07:15.691
Pre Surgery,

2208
02:07:15.691 --> 02:07:20.030
post surgery in the middle five years and get a real database to work from

2209
02:07:20.040 --> 02:07:23.880
because we don't have one right now.
I think,
look,
there's a women,
when I,

2210
02:07:23.910 --> 02:07:24.840
when I used to kick box,

2211
02:07:24.841 --> 02:07:28.590
there used to be this chick that used to come in the gym at fucking slug it out

2212
02:07:28.591 --> 02:07:31.320
with dudes.
Right?
And everybody supported her on that.
You,
you know,

2213
02:07:31.321 --> 02:07:32.370
you want to go in there and do that.

2214
02:07:32.460 --> 02:07:35.800
And I know girls that are pro MMA fighters to this day that go in the gym and

2215
02:07:35.801 --> 02:07:36.040
Duke

2216
02:07:36.040 --> 02:07:40.150
<v 3>it out with dudes and they do it because it makes them better and I am fucking</v>

2217
02:07:40.151 --> 02:07:42.790
100% but they know what they're doing when they're going in there.

2218
02:07:42.940 --> 02:07:43.810
They choose that.

2219
02:07:43.900 --> 02:07:48.580
And just like riding a bull or going BMX riding or anything else is dangerous as

2220
02:07:48.581 --> 02:07:52.900
long as you are fully aware of the parameters of the competition that you're

2221
02:07:52.901 --> 02:07:56.740
getting involved in and the wrist that they might entail.
Right.
I'm cool with it.

2222
02:07:56.830 --> 02:07:58.690
Yeah,
I'm,
yeah.
I just said earlier,

2223
02:07:58.691 --> 02:08:03.691
I'm all about disclosure for me and Vinny and [inaudible] and every part of your

2224
02:08:03.911 --> 02:08:04.960
life as a trans person,

2225
02:08:05.170 --> 02:08:08.560
we're different than the rest of the world and we have to understand that face

2226
02:08:08.561 --> 02:08:11.200
value.
I look like a guy,
but it doesn't mean that I,
that I,

2227
02:08:11.470 --> 02:08:14.170
that it's okay that you might think that way about me as well.

2228
02:08:14.250 --> 02:08:17.770
What's beautiful about today is you may be different than me or you may be

2229
02:08:17.771 --> 02:08:19.180
different than Jamie.
You might be different,

2230
02:08:19.181 --> 02:08:22.840
but you're not different than everybody and you can reach each other communities

2231
02:08:22.841 --> 02:08:25.300
now that can be established through the Internet.
It's,

2232
02:08:25.480 --> 02:08:28.660
there's so much broader and there's so much more varied.

2233
02:08:28.661 --> 02:08:32.350
There's so much more room for everybody.
You can find those folks.
Totally.

2234
02:08:32.351 --> 02:08:33.640
And I think that's a lot of that.

2235
02:08:33.670 --> 02:08:38.110
The enthusiasm about finding that is what creates all these weird acronyms and

2236
02:08:38.111 --> 02:08:43.110
secret languages and these weird inside talk inside it is,

2237
02:08:43.120 --> 02:08:47.710
it's our secret language.
You're inside,
you know,
I think that's sort of,

2238
02:08:47.740 --> 02:08:49.710
you know what,
that that kind of fosters that kind of thing.

2239
02:08:49.900 --> 02:08:52.750
I think that's a natural aspect of human interaction to make sure,

2240
02:08:53.110 --> 02:08:56.500
especially when finally you belong totally.
You know,

2241
02:08:56.501 --> 02:09:01.501
you like involve in an engross yourself in it and just really get super in depth

2242
02:09:02.230 --> 02:09:02.771
in it.
Yeah.

2243
02:09:02.771 --> 02:09:06.520
Because you can buddy up and we all know how we each feel about each other and

2244
02:09:06.680 --> 02:09:10.930
know how our lives,
where we all have the same story in different ways.

2245
02:09:11.200 --> 02:09:16.180
We all come to it and I think it's also super important that a guy like you

2246
02:09:16.210 --> 02:09:21.210
comes out and explains how much bullshit you had to deal with right before that

2247
02:09:21.611 --> 02:09:24.790
happened.
And your,
your,
your,
your point of view and how depressed,

2248
02:09:25.290 --> 02:09:29.290
how depressed you were and how gross it was to have to fucking fight people

2249
02:09:29.291 --> 02:09:31.120
cause they didn't like who you were.

2250
02:09:31.390 --> 02:09:35.110
And people can hear that and it will change people's opinions.

2251
02:09:35.140 --> 02:09:38.590
I totally think so.
Fuck.
Yeah,
we'll tell him.
But you know,
like I said,

2252
02:09:38.591 --> 02:09:40.120
people like you putting me on their show,

2253
02:09:40.130 --> 02:09:44.380
I totally give you props for that dude because your fan base doesn't know guys

2254
02:09:44.381 --> 02:09:47.710
like me.
And of course they're going to say stuff.
I totally get it,
but whoa.

2255
02:09:47.920 --> 02:09:52.060
I know that many of the guys are going to walk away going actually fuck is

2256
02:09:52.061 --> 02:09:54.130
totally it is.
You'd be surprised.
At my fan base,

2257
02:09:55.730 --> 02:09:57.460
there's a lot of Weirdos.
I'm the,

2258
02:09:57.580 --> 02:10:00.140
I'm the bridge between the meatheads and the pie.
Get it.
I tell him,

2259
02:10:00.150 --> 02:10:01.000
but that's my point.

2260
02:10:01.060 --> 02:10:05.750
That's important because those guys are the ones that are like,
oh well,
um,

2261
02:10:06.010 --> 02:10:08.590
they're just,
they just don't understand.
They don't want to understand.

2262
02:10:08.930 --> 02:10:13.270
They don't understand also that there's actual strength in not judging.

2263
02:10:13.570 --> 02:10:17.640
There's strength in being open this strength and being cool with everybody.

2264
02:10:17.770 --> 02:10:22.380
There's strength is personal strength.
Yes,
there is.
And being open to,

2265
02:10:22.381 --> 02:10:26.320
to have and not being as secure about that and that closed golf ness is actually

2266
02:10:26.321 --> 02:10:27.460
a weakness.
Clearly.

2267
02:10:27.770 --> 02:10:32.770
It also provides you and gives you conflict in your life that's unnecessary and

2268
02:10:33.050 --> 02:10:33.883
enemies in your life

2269
02:10:34.010 --> 02:10:36.800
<v 5>that are unnecessary.
They easily could be allies.
I know.</v>

2270
02:10:36.830 --> 02:10:37.970
That's what I was saying.
Yeah.

2271
02:10:37.971 --> 02:10:40.850
Now having the positive energy and discussing those things and understanding.

2272
02:10:40.970 --> 02:10:41.240
Yeah.

2273
02:10:41.240 --> 02:10:44.630
Remember what we said your opinion about felon is your opinion and I appreciate

2274
02:10:44.631 --> 02:10:49.610
that at Penn and she should to my opinion also happens to be the exact same

2275
02:10:49.611 --> 02:10:53.810
opinion of every single martial arts expert,
but I've talked interesting.

2276
02:10:53.960 --> 02:10:57.500
I have not talked to one had a diff that was one trainer.

2277
02:10:57.530 --> 02:11:02.120
Not One person involved deeply in the business,
not one fighter.
Male fighter.

2278
02:11:02.150 --> 02:11:06.650
Not One.
Not One said it makes everyone was like,
what?
Cause it's new.

2279
02:11:06.651 --> 02:11:11.450
She's not just that.
Well,
and also understand the advantages,

2280
02:11:11.480 --> 02:11:13.730
right?
There's,
there's,
there's critical advantages.

2281
02:11:14.270 --> 02:11:18.500
Even like great female fighters,
they like Misha Tate is a great female fighter.

2282
02:11:18.740 --> 02:11:21.050
She moves like a woman though.
There's a difference.

2283
02:11:21.051 --> 02:11:24.640
There's a difference in the way the body moves.
I see that,
you know?
Yeah.

2284
02:11:24.890 --> 02:11:28.580
People have.
There's,
there's a real,

2285
02:11:28.790 --> 02:11:33.770
like a consensus opinion about that across the board in the mixed martial arts

2286
02:11:33.771 --> 02:11:38.630
community and it's almost unanimously unanimously against someone doing that

2287
02:11:38.631 --> 02:11:43.040
without disclosure.
Right,
because it's not,
it's not fair.
That's the idea.
Yeah,

2288
02:11:43.041 --> 02:11:46.980
because the facts show it's not fair,
but the fact is Serena Williams I think,

2289
02:11:46.981 --> 02:11:51.770
or rec bitches,
she's a total cis woman.
I loved her.

2290
02:11:51.771 --> 02:11:55.220
You can't even be Serina Williams at an MMA gym.
She would just listen to me.

2291
02:11:55.970 --> 02:11:56.803
I would say Serena,

2292
02:11:56.810 --> 02:12:01.810
well you're going to be the baddest bitch kill it it Lawson and get but fallen

2293
02:12:01.821 --> 02:12:02.950
and her against each other.

2294
02:12:02.951 --> 02:12:05.840
Well what do you think that will fall would probably kick our ass.
Yeah.

2295
02:12:05.841 --> 02:12:09.860
You need to solve some skills if a person doesn't have any but after you after

2296
02:12:09.861 --> 02:12:11.690
your trainer and what do you think about that?

2297
02:12:11.840 --> 02:12:15.920
They would have to have a commensurate skill level before you can even judge.

2298
02:12:15.950 --> 02:12:17.690
And I would have to like actually see Fallon,

2299
02:12:17.691 --> 02:12:22.280
like hit a bag and see what she can actually do right now in person.
You know,

2300
02:12:22.340 --> 02:12:24.710
Serena Williams,
I'm sure it doesn't have any MMA training.

2301
02:12:24.711 --> 02:12:28.700
I mean to be that fucking good at tennis,
you're eating,
breathing,
sleeping,

2302
02:12:28.730 --> 02:12:32.570
eau Claire,
living tests,
but she's a super athlete.
Super.
Yeah.

2303
02:12:32.571 --> 02:12:37.010
If she just listened to me,
that pitch and the right gym,
I love her.

2304
02:12:37.011 --> 02:12:40.370
She's so awesome.
A couple of years I'll get you the right trainers.

2305
02:12:40.371 --> 02:12:43.190
Just listen to me.
I'm going to judge you.
I'm going to fucking,

2306
02:12:43.520 --> 02:12:45.530
I'm going to write journals every day.
We're going to take,

2307
02:12:46.130 --> 02:12:47.840
she would dominate female MMA.

2308
02:12:47.980 --> 02:12:52.250
She kills it more money and she's like,
fuck that.
I'm making.

2309
02:12:52.251 --> 02:12:56.600
I look at that body.
Jesus Louisa's look at her fucking body.

2310
02:12:56.930 --> 02:13:00.500
God Damn,
I love her.
If you were in a fight to the death with that chick,

2311
02:13:01.050 --> 02:13:04.870
you got to fight your dad.
You can't take it easy on her man.
Look at that arm.

2312
02:13:04.910 --> 02:13:09.650
My goodness.
If that arm got around your neck,
oh,
you're going to sleep at night.

2313
02:13:10.010 --> 02:13:13.460
If someone taught her how to do a triangle properly,
you ever see her legs,
Jamie,

2314
02:13:13.461 --> 02:13:15.410
pull up a picture of her legs.
Jesus.
Fuck

2315
02:13:17.420 --> 02:13:18.890
the legs of the gods,

2316
02:13:19.610 --> 02:13:23.270
the tightness of her vagina and must be a thing of legend.

2317
02:13:24.110 --> 02:13:27.900
If she clamped down on you,
it's probably like Doris.
You know a dog is like a,

2318
02:13:27.901 --> 02:13:32.310
the male dog locks into the female and the female wants to get away crying dogs

2319
02:13:32.311 --> 02:13:36.650
and pain
on pour hot water on them.

2320
02:13:37.100 --> 02:13:40.980
There's something physiological that happens to the male's penis where they

2321
02:13:40.981 --> 02:13:45.330
actually lock in there somehow in order to make sure,
look at her fucking legs.

2322
02:13:45.360 --> 02:13:49.260
Jesus.
Quieter ass dude.
Are you kidding?
God as his mom,

2323
02:13:49.280 --> 02:13:52.560
amazing that looks like her ass is pregnant with basketballs.

2324
02:13:53.870 --> 02:13:56.630
Look Real.
She guys at light gray out.

2325
02:13:56.920 --> 02:14:00.330
She looks like she could just jump over a building.
I mean she is super woman.

2326
02:14:00.360 --> 02:14:04.350
She could just launch herself over the entire fucking tennis arena.

2327
02:14:04.830 --> 02:14:09.780
What a fucking ass Mike that is isolate ultra.

2328
02:14:09.860 --> 02:14:12.240
Ooh,
wow.
Wow.

2329
02:14:12.241 --> 02:14:15.250
Where did he get the fuck is that ass?

2330
02:14:15.270 --> 02:14:18.960
Look at that shipping out her ass is insanity.
It's a Photoshop.

2331
02:14:18.961 --> 02:14:22.290
It looks like a Photoshop.
Photoshop and make sure that's not a Photoshop.

2332
02:14:22.410 --> 02:14:26.430
Find other corroborating pieces of that are real.
That's so ridiculous,

2333
02:14:26.580 --> 02:14:27.300
but I've seen,

2334
02:14:27.300 --> 02:14:31.680
I've seen enough that I think it is what her ass really looks like.
That's power.

2335
02:14:31.950 --> 02:14:36.240
God Damn,
you ain't kittens.
That girl,
Jesus Christ.

2336
02:14:36.690 --> 02:14:40.860
That girl's got some fucking genetics.
Super Woo.

2337
02:14:41.220 --> 02:14:45.600
Like I said,
the amount of pull,
it's insane.
Yeah.

2338
02:14:45.601 --> 02:14:47.220
That's on the beach.
It Shit's real.

2339
02:14:47.370 --> 02:14:48.890
And that's not even like in the middle of training.

2340
02:14:49.460 --> 02:14:54.410
That's just humped smiling with sunglasses are smiling with sunglasses on was

2341
02:14:54.490 --> 02:14:58.830
with ultra ass trailing behind her.
That's like three acid.

2342
02:14:59.550 --> 02:15:04.200
She has like three small white girl asses packed in together.
Yeah.

2343
02:15:04.220 --> 02:15:07.320
That's um,
you can't,
yeah.
You can't get that every day.

2344
02:15:07.770 --> 02:15:09.500
If every woman looked like there,
that'd be,
we have it.

2345
02:15:09.501 --> 02:15:13.740
We'd be a totally different species of human look at that fucking body.

2346
02:15:13.980 --> 02:15:17.640
James asked if that was the genetics of every woman.
We all bread,

2347
02:15:17.641 --> 02:15:21.570
we would have warrior children.
We would,
we would make,

2348
02:15:21.571 --> 02:15:23.340
like everyone would looked like 300

2349
02:15:24.930 --> 02:15:27.000
after they did the CGI on their bodies.

2350
02:15:27.810 --> 02:15:32.010
Everyone's body would look like 300 it'd be insane.
Yeah.
I mean there's,

2351
02:15:32.190 --> 02:15:35.350
that's in,
that has also the gray area when you're talking about transgender,

2352
02:15:35.351 --> 02:15:40.150
it's like that a woman assists gender woman like her exists and then,
you know,

2353
02:15:40.200 --> 02:15:42.930
what does that,
that's how freak,
yeah.
End of the spectrum.

2354
02:15:42.990 --> 02:15:44.310
That's a gender willing.

2355
02:15:44.360 --> 02:15:47.970
So like maybe we should look at what her bone density is and all of the things

2356
02:15:47.971 --> 02:15:51.160
that she has in her musculature and then look at,
I mean,

2357
02:15:51.510 --> 02:15:54.450
but also the weight class too.
She would be clearly a heavyweight and I,

2358
02:15:54.540 --> 02:15:59.400
I don't know how much she weighs,
but I got to fix,
she's a buck 65 at least.

2359
02:15:59.820 --> 02:16:04.010
And think about the,
the full spectrum go Molly Ringwald.
Right.

2360
02:16:05.630 --> 02:16:10.370
You know,
that's what came to mind.
Pasty red head.

2361
02:16:10.760 --> 02:16:14.400
It just looks like she bruises every time she runs into a corner of a table.

2362
02:16:16.480 --> 02:16:21.180
Shin bruises and hangnails are swollen,
poor modeling sexy.

2363
02:16:21.181 --> 02:16:24.600
I can't see soft and white.
Yeah.

2364
02:16:25.080 --> 02:16:29.280
Take her outside and the bright sign she turns pink eye immediately.

2365
02:16:29.350 --> 02:16:30.760
Ah,

2366
02:16:31.300 --> 02:16:35.530
<v 4>fucking vampire.
Yeah,
I mean,
and that's the same with males as well.</v>

2367
02:16:35.531 --> 02:16:39.310
That's a real issue with men's athletics.
Um,
in mixed martial arts as well.

2368
02:16:39.490 --> 02:16:42.610
And that has nothing to do with steroids.

2369
02:16:42.640 --> 02:16:46.180
There's people that are just natural super athletes.

2370
02:16:46.400 --> 02:16:50.560
And then there's other folks that just have really slow twitch muscle fibers

2371
02:16:50.770 --> 02:16:52.960
that wouldn't be bad if they're triathletes.

2372
02:16:53.110 --> 02:16:57.460
But in an MMA fight they just can't generate speed and power and then they
fight.

2373
02:16:57.461 --> 02:17:00.670
Someone was just boom,
they can just blast them.

2374
02:17:00.850 --> 02:17:05.380
And it's sad to watch because you know that fight or a will never beat fight or

2375
02:17:05.381 --> 02:17:06.330
be,
you know,

2376
02:17:06.340 --> 02:17:09.580
there's fight or being in the ring in the first place cause they're good.

2377
02:17:09.610 --> 02:17:13.330
They're just not good enough.
They're good.
They get like there's certain guys,

2378
02:17:13.331 --> 02:17:15.700
I wanted to mention any names,
but I'll mentioned the positive side.

2379
02:17:15.840 --> 02:17:20.020
There are certain guys that they're never going to beat a guy like Jack Ra
Sousa.

2380
02:17:20.320 --> 02:17:25.320
There's a guy pull up his picture of Jocko Ray j a c a r a Souza against you

2381
02:17:26.161 --> 02:17:27.100
Shin Okami.

2382
02:17:27.760 --> 02:17:31.480
There's photos of him beating the fuck out of this bad ass Japanese dude.

2383
02:17:31.481 --> 02:17:32.261
You should know Cami.
No,

2384
02:17:32.261 --> 02:17:36.940
you should know Cami is a bad motherfucker and this jock ray guy is such a

2385
02:17:36.941 --> 02:17:41.500
physical freak that he just crushed this guy.

2386
02:17:41.530 --> 02:17:42.363
I mean cry.

2387
02:17:42.430 --> 02:17:47.430
There's certain guys that just have this very unique physical ability and no

2388
02:17:47.561 --> 02:17:52.210
matter what you do,
you're never going to beat that.
As long as he's training,

2389
02:17:52.330 --> 02:17:55.420
as long as he's learning skills,
as long as he's dedicating himself,

2390
02:17:55.780 --> 02:18:00.780
he has certain inherent advantages that he was blessed with that you can't

2391
02:18:01.721 --> 02:18:06.640
overcome,
right?
Because if a guy is not just physical,

2392
02:18:06.670 --> 02:18:08.110
not just has the physical ability,

2393
02:18:08.111 --> 02:18:11.890
but also puts in the dedication and has the intelligence and the mental
strength.

2394
02:18:12.010 --> 02:18:16.090
If he has all those those factors,
it's not fair.
Some fair,
right?

2395
02:18:16.091 --> 02:18:17.140
Because if you don't have those,

2396
02:18:17.141 --> 02:18:19.660
if you just super tough and you're really technical,

2397
02:18:19.661 --> 02:18:21.920
but your fucking body sucks a fat Dick,
right?

2398
02:18:21.921 --> 02:18:26.921
And you just got some old school slow poke DNA and you just can't get over that.

2399
02:18:27.851 --> 02:18:31.690
The physical hump,
that guy can crack you at will and you can't reach him.

2400
02:18:31.960 --> 02:18:35.590
You can't get ahold of them.
You can't hit them when you want to.
He's too fast.

2401
02:18:35.910 --> 02:18:37.240
There's nothing you can do a pull up,
you get getting.

2402
02:18:37.250 --> 02:18:40.750
Is there any photos of John Gray said with someone or just,
well,

2403
02:18:40.751 --> 02:18:43.200
just if you find it impressive photo of him and look at,

2404
02:18:43.210 --> 02:18:46.690
Oh that guy is a fucking superstud.

2405
02:18:46.840 --> 02:18:48.340
It's hard to tell from that picture.

2406
02:18:48.430 --> 02:18:50.980
If you see there's a picture of him beating the shit out of Okami.

2407
02:18:51.790 --> 02:18:55.900
If you see [inaudible] versus Okami look at Jockey wraith.
Yes.

2408
02:18:56.200 --> 02:19:00.490
O k a m I Brazil.
He was a world Jujitsu champion,

2409
02:19:00.491 --> 02:19:03.470
multiple time world Jujitsu champion.
And now he's fighting in MMA and just,

2410
02:19:03.820 --> 02:19:06.880
and he,
you know,
and he is the argument towards Fallon,

2411
02:19:06.881 --> 02:19:11.881
Fox is side that there's a broad spectrum in both sexes as assuming a Williams.

2412
02:19:12.110 --> 02:19:14.590
Yeah.
Right.
So then yes.
So does that,

2413
02:19:14.620 --> 02:19:17.500
so that's actually a really good question because then you have that,

2414
02:19:17.501 --> 02:19:19.900
is that fair?
But [inaudible] yeah.

2415
02:19:20.380 --> 02:19:22.870
See if you can find the picture of him beating the shit out of Okami.

2416
02:19:23.110 --> 02:19:26.800
Cause there's some photos of him smashing Okami where you look at his body and

2417
02:19:26.801 --> 02:19:30.380
just Jesus fucking Christ have you see a move.

2418
02:19:30.381 --> 02:19:33.950
It's even spookier cause he moves like a cat and it moves like a big giant cat

2419
02:19:34.310 --> 02:19:37.880
just springs on with getting the shit beat out of them in a fight.

2420
02:19:37.910 --> 02:19:40.270
Do they like stop it at a certain yes.
Yeah.

2421
02:19:40.610 --> 02:19:43.250
It looks like you're going to die there.
You see him?
They're teeing off on him.

2422
02:19:43.251 --> 02:19:47.900
But if you see them actually moving it's even spookier.
Yeah,
they stop it.
If a,

2423
02:19:47.901 --> 02:19:51.260
if a guy can't defend himself and not defending himself or if the referee thinks

2424
02:19:51.261 --> 02:19:52.640
he's taking too much punishment.
Right.

2425
02:19:52.670 --> 02:19:56.150
The referee is free to stop at anytime if he feels like it's not competitive

2426
02:19:56.151 --> 02:19:56.571
anymore.

2427
02:19:56.571 --> 02:20:01.460
The guys with danger and that's the most important job the referee has rescuing

2428
02:20:01.461 --> 02:20:05.330
people from danger.
Danger.
Yeah.
Most stores thing that ever happened in a ring.

2429
02:20:05.331 --> 02:20:08.330
If someone ever die in there,
not,
not in the UFC.

2430
02:20:08.360 --> 02:20:13.100
A guy died this week in Brazil from weight cutting.
Actually.
What's that?

2431
02:20:13.190 --> 02:20:17.060
Weight cutting is.
Um,
these guys,
they want to,
there's some fucking,

2432
02:20:17.061 --> 02:20:20.450
some dude's arm up.
He's a monster.

2433
02:20:20.630 --> 02:20:25.280
He's his Jujitsu is nasty too.
He's a,
he's,
he's a fucking beast.

2434
02:20:25.610 --> 02:20:30.140
Um,
a guy weight cutting is like say if you're going to compete at 155 pounds,

2435
02:20:30.410 --> 02:20:34.130
you want all the advantages that you can get and one of the best advantages is

2436
02:20:34.131 --> 02:20:35.300
you dehydrate yourself.

2437
02:20:35.930 --> 02:20:40.930
So you make 155 pounds and then you rehydrate yourself up to like one 70 ish and

2438
02:20:40.971 --> 02:20:43.150
then you go into the ring,
they use IV,

2439
02:20:43.151 --> 02:20:46.160
so you're going to the rink fully hydrated and you feel great,

2440
02:20:46.370 --> 02:20:49.220
but you weighed in at one 55 and now you're way one 70,

2441
02:20:49.221 --> 02:20:52.310
so you're really big for the weight class and there's a point of diminishing

2442
02:20:52.311 --> 02:20:52.761
returns.

2443
02:20:52.761 --> 02:20:56.420
We cut too much weight and it weakens your body so much that you can't perform

2444
02:20:56.421 --> 02:20:57.290
well the next day.

2445
02:20:57.500 --> 02:21:00.830
And then there's way past that point where this guy went to where he died.

2446
02:21:00.950 --> 02:21:03.830
This is the first state cut cause he cut to cut too much weight.

2447
02:21:04.040 --> 02:21:07.820
This is the first known case that I'm aware of in MMA if someone dying,

2448
02:21:07.821 --> 02:21:11.720
but it's been a problem with college wrestling for a long time and high school

2449
02:21:11.721 --> 02:21:15.620
wrestling either even rather to the point where they've started to monitor

2450
02:21:15.710 --> 02:21:19.640
athletes weights and how much they cost and how much they put back on and they

2451
02:21:19.641 --> 02:21:22.460
make sure that they don't get below a certain amount of body fat.

2452
02:21:22.700 --> 02:21:26.360
They're not there.
Make sure that they don't cut too much water.
Wow,
that's scary.

2453
02:21:26.361 --> 02:21:30.680
It's very scary and it's even more scary in combat sports because in combat

2454
02:21:30.681 --> 02:21:35.570
sports you're also dealing with the effects of the a concussive impacts on the

2455
02:21:35.571 --> 02:21:40.190
dehydrated brain and much more dangerous is a little known fact,

2456
02:21:40.191 --> 02:21:43.700
but all of the deaths in professional boxing that have occurred inside the ring,

2457
02:21:44.180 --> 02:21:47.330
at least almost all of them have been under the heavyweight division.

2458
02:21:47.690 --> 02:21:49.670
It's all in the divisions where people had to cut weight.

2459
02:21:50.750 --> 02:21:55.520
So then you weigh in at that way,
then you rehydrate.
Is that,
is that legal?

2460
02:21:55.550 --> 02:22:00.260
Yes.
Oh it is.
That doesn't make sense to me.
Exactly.
You know why?

2461
02:22:00.380 --> 02:22:03.980
Cause you're looking at it as an objective observer that's intelligent and

2462
02:22:03.981 --> 02:22:06.890
hasn't already like decided that that's just a part of the landscape.

2463
02:22:07.190 --> 02:22:09.870
When you're looking at it normally you'd like,
this is crazy.
This is crazy.

2464
02:22:09.871 --> 02:22:12.830
We shouldn't let people do that.
Guy's about the wait.

2465
02:22:13.030 --> 02:22:16.220
So that's all you're focused on.
Yes.
There's two different fights.

2466
02:22:16.520 --> 02:22:19.400
There's the fight that happens in the gym and or the in the,
uh,

2467
02:22:19.401 --> 02:22:23.210
the cage and there's the fight that happens to get to the scale to get to this

2468
02:22:23.211 --> 02:22:26.010
cause two different completely.
You can't fight in this year.
That exact

2469
02:22:26.010 --> 02:22:30.870
<v 5>white,
right?
Yeah.
So for the,
the,
the 24 to 48 hours before weighing is horrific.</v>

2470
02:22:31.660 --> 02:22:34.670
A nightmare.
They dehydrate themselves.
It's radically hearted.

2471
02:22:34.710 --> 02:22:38.370
They don't eat a fucking don't,
ain't shit.
They lead very little food.

2472
02:22:38.490 --> 02:22:41.990
There's starving.
By the time they get on that sailors do the same thing,
right?

2473
02:22:41.991 --> 02:22:43.620
They have to like,
yeah,
but they don't get head.

2474
02:22:43.621 --> 02:22:45.650
They don't have to like smack each other around.
Right.

2475
02:22:45.670 --> 02:22:50.220
You get fucking shins bounced off their dome 40 miles an hour.

2476
02:22:50.280 --> 02:22:51.113
That's weird though.

2477
02:22:51.230 --> 02:22:56.230
Do they talk about this and are they planning on fixing this or there's not much

2478
02:22:56.611 --> 02:22:57.560
they can do?
Um,

2479
02:22:57.620 --> 02:23:00.840
the one thing that they've done is they've moved the went cause you can't stop

2480
02:23:00.841 --> 02:23:02.580
people from doing that if they want to do that.

2481
02:23:02.670 --> 02:23:06.510
I'm talking about the actual like laws of the,
of the UFC.

2482
02:23:06.511 --> 02:23:10.800
Like maybe they should make the weight in a variable there of five pounds or

2483
02:23:10.801 --> 02:23:13.260
something or what you do that because then they would,

2484
02:23:13.261 --> 02:23:16.080
people would just get heavier.
They would make sure that they were heavy.

2485
02:23:18.160 --> 02:23:19.400
So if you varied it,

2486
02:23:19.410 --> 02:23:22.290
if you said like you don't have to wait and one 55 you can be as heavy as one 60

2487
02:23:22.320 --> 02:23:22.530
right.

2488
02:23:22.530 --> 02:23:26.090
Then they would go get up to one 80 write down the one 16 then they would still,

2489
02:23:26.091 --> 02:23:27.400
but they'd still be bigger.

2490
02:23:27.810 --> 02:23:30.060
They'd be even bigger because they've got it down to a science.

2491
02:23:30.360 --> 02:23:31.230
Like there's some guys,

2492
02:23:31.231 --> 02:23:35.070
like the best guys is a Brazilian guy's name is Gleason t bow.

2493
02:23:35.340 --> 02:23:40.340
He will cut 30 pounds and he will weigh in holy at one 55 but fight closer to

2494
02:23:42.241 --> 02:23:46.890
one 80 he will put most of it back on by the time.
Pull up this guy,

2495
02:23:47.010 --> 02:23:51.480
g a t bow,
uh,
g l man.
Try spelling that.
Oh,

2496
02:23:51.481 --> 02:23:53.810
you found them good size.
This motherfucker.

2497
02:23:54.080 --> 02:23:55.800
If you saw how big this guy is in person,

2498
02:23:55.801 --> 02:24:00.320
he's five [inaudible] 10 and he weighs in at one 55 and he's,
he fought antic.

2499
02:24:00.330 --> 02:24:03.570
Yeah,
he's gigantic.
When he gets in the cage,

2500
02:24:04.020 --> 02:24:08.520
I mean he's a fucking monster.
He's the very best in the world at cutting weight.

2501
02:24:08.550 --> 02:24:12.260
No one cuts with better than that guy.
Yeah,
they have it down to a science.

2502
02:24:12.261 --> 02:24:12.960
They have to,

2503
02:24:12.960 --> 02:24:17.960
it's also biospecific like you might be better at weight cutting than I am and I

2504
02:24:18.361 --> 02:24:19.470
might be better than he is.

2505
02:24:19.550 --> 02:24:22.620
Some people can dehydrate the shit out of themselves and re and bounced back

2506
02:24:22.621 --> 02:24:23.730
easy and cut a lot of weight.

2507
02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:28.650
Other guys can't do it and it affects people very differently and no one

2508
02:24:28.651 --> 02:24:31.800
understands why.
They don't know if it's a genetic issue.

2509
02:24:31.860 --> 02:24:35.340
If it's a diet issue,
they don't know.

2510
02:24:35.370 --> 02:24:38.370
But some guys can cut up fuck load away and they do that.

2511
02:24:38.371 --> 02:24:41.010
How do they get the weight was a bunch of different ways.

2512
02:24:41.340 --> 02:24:44.070
Putting something on some they don't.
They're trying not to do that anymore.

2513
02:24:44.100 --> 02:24:46.860
That's the old school way to do it.
And some guys still do it that way,

2514
02:24:46.861 --> 02:24:50.250
but that's actually dangerous.
The way they do it now is through distilled water.

2515
02:24:50.610 --> 02:24:54.570
They take massive amounts of water up till the way in,

2516
02:24:54.571 --> 02:24:58.980
up to the week of the way in and then on several days before the way and they

2517
02:24:58.981 --> 02:25:01.920
drank only distilled water and they drink quite a bit of it.

2518
02:25:02.070 --> 02:25:04.710
So your body is used to as pissing out this water.

2519
02:25:04.950 --> 02:25:07.800
Distilled water is no minerals in it at all.
So you're just,

2520
02:25:07.890 --> 02:25:10.490
the water's going in you and are you in you now you're right through it.

2521
02:25:10.500 --> 02:25:13.740
You're not retaining it.
And so then leading up to the fight,

2522
02:25:13.920 --> 02:25:17.340
they stopped drinking water at all and they piss everything out.

2523
02:25:17.490 --> 02:25:20.790
So they get down to like nothing.
Then they step on the scale,

2524
02:25:20.791 --> 02:25:23.980
they weigh in at whatever it is.
And then they slowly

2525
02:25:23.980 --> 02:25:27.640
<v 4>rehydrate,
first of all with pedialyte,
which is an electrolyte supplement.</v>

2526
02:25:28.030 --> 02:25:32.740
And then they go to Ivs,
they take an IV bag and they'd take it.
Yeah,

2527
02:25:32.741 --> 02:25:33.700
it's no joke,
man.

2528
02:25:34.060 --> 02:25:39.060
And the Ivy bag is apparently the best way to rehydrate your noggin because the

2529
02:25:40.300 --> 02:25:42.640
brain,
the brain fluid is the real issue.

2530
02:25:42.970 --> 02:25:44.530
And doing it through the digestive tract,

2531
02:25:44.531 --> 02:25:49.531
apparently it takes much more time for sure than it does a through the right

2532
02:25:49.631 --> 02:25:52.290
into your blood and can rehydrate much quicker.
Right.

2533
02:25:52.390 --> 02:25:55.990
This is the size of this guy to glace and tee ball.
Yeah.
I think,

2534
02:25:56.020 --> 02:25:57.850
I don't know which one is pre way in.

2535
02:25:58.140 --> 02:26:00.970
That's the one on the right is when he's dried out.

2536
02:26:01.060 --> 02:26:05.200
It just looks like the same muscular guy.
Just a little smaller it looks like.

2537
02:26:05.260 --> 02:26:08.650
Yeah.
And then on the left he just with the white shorts on,

2538
02:26:09.050 --> 02:26:11.650
see the size of that motherfucker.
He's a tank too.

2539
02:26:11.740 --> 02:26:15.490
He's a strong mother fucker and he's also a black belt in Jujitsu.
All right.

2540
02:26:15.670 --> 02:26:19.030
And he's got like 30 fucking plus MMA fights.
He's a beast,

2541
02:26:19.270 --> 02:26:20.590
but he's the best at doing that.

2542
02:26:20.591 --> 02:26:25.300
But it's a dangerous game the way it's really not cool for your brain to do
that.

2543
02:26:25.330 --> 02:26:28.660
I've seen guys walk up to that scale where they look like they're dead.

2544
02:26:28.810 --> 02:26:29.411
They will,

2545
02:26:29.411 --> 02:26:33.910
they struggle to get the weigh ins on the top of a platform and they have to go

2546
02:26:33.911 --> 02:26:36.400
up this platform but go up the stairs to get to this platform.

2547
02:26:36.610 --> 02:26:41.610
I've seen guys who are going to fight in a cage in 24 hours and they can barely

2548
02:26:42.071 --> 02:26:44.470
walk up those stairs.
Wow.
Barely make it

2549
02:26:47.140 --> 02:26:49.180
real dangerous.
Nothing they can do about it.

2550
02:26:49.330 --> 02:26:52.930
The best thing they've done is move the weigh ins from uh,

2551
02:26:52.990 --> 02:26:56.200
the day of the fights to 24 hours before boxing did that.

2552
02:26:56.440 --> 02:26:58.180
And then what does that do?
It gives them more teams,

2553
02:26:58.220 --> 02:27:02.210
more time to get into the ring because they used to do with the day of,

2554
02:27:02.230 --> 02:27:03.820
they used to do it the morning of the fights.

2555
02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:07.270
Guys used to weigh in and then they would go and fight that night and weight

2556
02:27:07.271 --> 02:27:11.890
cutting and has existed forever and boxing and wrestling and you know,

2557
02:27:11.891 --> 02:27:15.130
and as soon as MMA had weight classes,
people started waking up out of air.

2558
02:27:15.550 --> 02:27:19.150
It's always,
it's,
you know,
because especially with MMA because MMA,

2559
02:27:19.420 --> 02:27:23.830
they came into it with a wrestler.
It's a mentality and a lot of MMA fighters,

2560
02:27:23.831 --> 02:27:28.150
their bases in wrestling and in fact it's the best base for MMA and those guys

2561
02:27:28.151 --> 02:27:30.080
that came into it or used to cutting way,
right.

2562
02:27:30.130 --> 02:27:32.050
They're really good at it and they don't know how to do it well.

2563
02:27:32.350 --> 02:27:36.100
The issue of course is that their sport doesn't have head trauma or much head

2564
02:27:36.101 --> 02:27:39.150
trauma,
whereas MMA is all about,
it's all about that.
Yeah,

2565
02:27:39.220 --> 02:27:43.150
and head trauma with dehydration,
I'm surprised that hasn't been more death.

2566
02:27:44.300 --> 02:27:47.290
They're on the ball.
The doctors are excellent.
The referees are excellent.

2567
02:27:47.320 --> 02:27:48.153
The commissions,

2568
02:27:48.400 --> 02:27:51.460
they keep a close eye on fighters and they test the shit out of it before they

2569
02:27:51.461 --> 02:27:55.240
actually get into the cage.
They make them do Mris,
a full full blood scan.

2570
02:27:55.241 --> 02:27:58.480
They make sure that these people that go in there healthy and they've actually

2571
02:27:58.481 --> 02:28:01.930
found a lot of like real issues with people because of these scans that have,

2572
02:28:01.960 --> 02:28:02.231
you know,

2573
02:28:02.231 --> 02:28:05.530
like people didn't know they had like an aneurysm ready to happen in your brain.

2574
02:28:05.531 --> 02:28:08.590
If they got hit out.
My friend Dan Hardy,

2575
02:28:08.680 --> 02:28:12.580
who was a top level MMA fighter found out he had an extra heartbeat,

2576
02:28:12.760 --> 02:28:16.540
some weird aberration of his heart ways get his primary heartbeat and he's got

2577
02:28:16.541 --> 02:28:21.541
this weird sort of extra beat that goes on and the worry is that this extra beat

2578
02:28:21.771 --> 02:28:21.980
can

2579
02:28:21.980 --> 02:28:24.390
<v 5>overcome him and he could possibly have a heart attack.
Right.</v>

2580
02:28:24.560 --> 02:28:26.390
I don't understand the medical aspect of it,

2581
02:28:26.391 --> 02:28:30.260
but he can't fight now unless he has his operation where they go into his chest

2582
02:28:30.261 --> 02:28:33.950
and remove this extra heartbeat.
Yeah.
You can't fight now.

2583
02:28:33.951 --> 02:28:38.951
And he's a top level pro and it's just the concern by these athletic commissions

2584
02:28:39.141 --> 02:28:42.950
and the doctors have,
have kept him from,
uh,
from competing.

2585
02:28:42.951 --> 02:28:46.010
So he hasn't fought in the UFC and a couple of years.
It's a real issue.

2586
02:28:46.100 --> 02:28:49.220
Why does he get an operation?
Well for him,
he doesn't feel like he needs it.

2587
02:28:49.250 --> 02:28:52.070
He doesn't feel like it's warranted,
unnecessary and fighting.

2588
02:28:52.400 --> 02:28:56.660
It's also he underwent,
and I hate using these terms,

2589
02:28:56.990 --> 02:29:00.050
but in his case it's actually the correct term.

2590
02:29:00.230 --> 02:29:04.610
He underwent a spiritual transformation.
He uh,
went to uh,
uh,

2591
02:29:04.740 --> 02:29:09.740
the Amazon and took Iowasca and sort of his reassessed his entire life since

2592
02:29:10.911 --> 02:29:15.350
then.
And uh,
it was really not totally had an awakening.
Yeah,
he's totally fine.

2593
02:29:16.150 --> 02:29:19.550
Zahn but it's,
it happens if you take it.

2594
02:29:19.840 --> 02:29:23.750
And also I think those things happen.
Oh yeah.
I really believe that it happens.

2595
02:29:23.780 --> 02:29:25.320
Have you ever done Iowasca but I,

2596
02:29:25.321 --> 02:29:30.080
I would be pretty awesome to do you need to do it?
I think so.
Yeah.
Well,

2597
02:29:30.081 --> 02:29:34.190
I've done the strongest version of it,
which is the pure dimethyl trip to me.

2598
02:29:34.250 --> 02:29:37.580
Oh my God.
Get the Amazon and he didn't know I was at my house.

2599
02:29:39.200 --> 02:29:43.170
And you're painting an all Amazon go where the bugs are.
That's ridiculous.

2600
02:29:43.450 --> 02:29:44.690
He doesn't give a fuck.

2601
02:29:44.750 --> 02:29:48.620
Where are you are one of the things he realized when you do DMT is the earth

2602
02:29:48.621 --> 02:29:51.470
gives zero fucks where you are.
While this is happening,

2603
02:29:51.920 --> 02:29:55.790
you do not need to be in the desert is way bigger than that.

2604
02:29:56.450 --> 02:29:59.480
It's the whole universe.
No,
totally.
Wow.

2605
02:29:59.510 --> 02:30:04.150
Dimethyltryptamine is the pure version of what the Io Osca experiences.

2606
02:30:04.670 --> 02:30:09.670
Iowasca is the orally active version of dimethyltryptamine and these shamans in

2607
02:30:10.101 --> 02:30:13.340
the Amazon figured many,
many thousands of years ago.

2608
02:30:13.341 --> 02:30:17.540
We don't even know when they figured out how to combine these ingredients in

2609
02:30:17.541 --> 02:30:19.760
order to make DMT orally active.

2610
02:30:20.450 --> 02:30:23.670
DMT normally is not orally active because it exists.

2611
02:30:23.671 --> 02:30:26.240
It's so many different plants.
So many you would,

2612
02:30:26.241 --> 02:30:30.930
you would be tripping all the time.
Right.
Salad,
really no bullshit.
So your,

2613
02:30:30.950 --> 02:30:35.720
your body produces something called [inaudible] oxidase and monoamine oxidase

2614
02:30:35.721 --> 02:30:37.700
breaks down dimethyltryptamine in the gut.

2615
02:30:37.910 --> 02:30:40.730
So what they've done with Iowasca is it's a combat,

2616
02:30:40.731 --> 02:30:44.330
a Tory drug where they've taken the route of one plant and the leaves of the

2617
02:30:44.331 --> 02:30:46.850
other and the leaves are a,
or the root.

2618
02:30:46.851 --> 02:30:51.230
One of them is a natural Mao inhibitor and uh,
it's called harming.

2619
02:30:51.231 --> 02:30:56.231
And they boil this stuff down together and they create this thing where the Mao

2620
02:30:56.781 --> 02:31:00.920
inhibitor and the DMT or all together.
So that as you drink it,

2621
02:31:00.921 --> 02:31:02.000
it goes into your gut.

2622
02:31:02.001 --> 02:31:06.800
But the mano aiming oxidase gets killed by the harming and the DMT goes right

2623
02:31:06.801 --> 02:31:08.670
into the bloodstream.
Yeah.

2624
02:31:09.330 --> 02:31:12.410
[inaudible] it's like a slow release version.

2625
02:31:13.170 --> 02:31:16.310
When you go to the spirit world.
It's for real.

2626
02:31:16.490 --> 02:31:19.940
The idea of the spirit world sounds like everything that everybody

2627
02:31:20.340 --> 02:31:21.210
<v 4>thinks about.</v>

2628
02:31:21.211 --> 02:31:26.211
When you think of like if you took a pill and you went to a magic place where

2629
02:31:26.551 --> 02:31:31.551
there's dragons and demons and aliens and spaceships and fractals all around

2630
02:31:32.731 --> 02:31:33.420
you,

2631
02:31:33.420 --> 02:31:38.420
it's that times a million plus plus it's way more real than reality itself.

2632
02:31:40.330 --> 02:31:44.610
And Yeah,
and well Dan Hardee went down there and did this and a,

2633
02:31:44.611 --> 02:31:48.810
he's like a few tile.
It's like Kinda like,
what am I doing?

2634
02:31:48.811 --> 02:31:53.620
Like what is the,
what's the necessary evil here?
What is the what,
what,
what?

2635
02:31:53.621 --> 02:31:57.060
What is really being done here?
What is,
what am I really pursuing?

2636
02:31:57.210 --> 02:31:59.610
And he realized that what he's,
he was basically on a vision quest.

2637
02:31:59.611 --> 02:32:04.380
His life was like a vision quest and to to find himself to seek truth.

2638
02:32:04.590 --> 02:32:07.350
He did it through combat.
You know,
he did it through physical,

2639
02:32:07.470 --> 02:32:10.800
one on one competition and the most dangerous sport in the world.

2640
02:32:11.040 --> 02:32:13.580
And then in having this Iowa,
and I'm,

2641
02:32:13.581 --> 02:32:17.970
I'm really speaking out of turn to put these words into his mouth,

2642
02:32:17.971 --> 02:32:22.971
but I think what I got out of it from speaking to him was that he,

2643
02:32:23.310 --> 02:32:27.540
now that he understands that this whole world exists and that it exists,

2644
02:32:27.910 --> 02:32:29.310
existed always,

2645
02:32:29.460 --> 02:32:32.970
and it was behind the curtain that he couldn't see the little man behind the

2646
02:32:32.971 --> 02:32:34.020
curtain point of chords.

2647
02:32:34.200 --> 02:32:36.300
And then all of a sudden he saw it and he sees everything.

2648
02:32:36.301 --> 02:32:39.000
He saw the whole thing that he's just,
his perspective,

2649
02:32:39.090 --> 02:32:40.770
it was altered so radically.

2650
02:32:41.130 --> 02:32:45.060
And it also coincided with when he was diagnosed with this condition.

2651
02:32:45.061 --> 02:32:47.970
So it's almost like the universe is giving them a new planet.
Totally is.

2652
02:32:48.420 --> 02:32:51.750
It totally is.
I'm a big believer of that.
It's possible.
I mean,

2653
02:32:51.780 --> 02:32:55.290
it's possible you create it all yourself inside your imagination as well.

2654
02:32:55.770 --> 02:32:59.210
There's many things out there that are possible.
Yeah.
If you're helping to me,

2655
02:32:59.250 --> 02:33:04.050
Oh yeah.
Have to be open to it.
Fuck yeah.
The imagination itself as scary as fuck.

2656
02:33:04.570 --> 02:33:07.380
That's why people aren't open to it.
Yeah,
I look at that.

2657
02:33:07.381 --> 02:33:11.790
It can just freak you out.
Imagination is madness.
Just what it is.
I mean,

2658
02:33:11.791 --> 02:33:14.040
everybody thinks that the imagination is being,
Oh,
you know,

2659
02:33:14.041 --> 02:33:17.280
he thinks about things that aren't really,
they're sort of,

2660
02:33:17.550 --> 02:33:21.420
but the imagination is also what made cities,
it also,

2661
02:33:21.421 --> 02:33:22.650
what made the laptops,

2662
02:33:22.651 --> 02:33:27.420
they made every physical object that has ever been created had to be invented

2663
02:33:27.590 --> 02:33:29.520
and it had to be invented through the imagination.

2664
02:33:29.550 --> 02:33:33.780
Even it was done in steps like first came the tire and then came the wheel and

2665
02:33:33.781 --> 02:33:34.800
then came the engine.

2666
02:33:35.100 --> 02:33:37.890
All those things combined created a car that gets you to Vegas.

2667
02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:42.750
That's a real thing.
You know all those created a plane that gets you in the air.

2668
02:33:42.751 --> 02:33:45.870
All those created a fucking spaceship that launches a satellite into orbit.

2669
02:33:46.020 --> 02:33:49.110
All those created a phone that allows you to text someone who's in Australia.

2670
02:33:49.290 --> 02:33:53.010
All those creative light bulbs,
all,
I mean,
all that shit is imagination.

2671
02:33:53.250 --> 02:33:56.340
Imagination has reshaped the entire surface of the fucking planet.

2672
02:33:56.460 --> 02:33:59.940
Like no other thing.
Entity.

2673
02:33:59.941 --> 02:34:04.941
I didn't know no other power more so than fucking volcanoes cell after he had

2674
02:34:05.671 --> 02:34:10.330
that trip and he doesn't fight anymore till you find that he found that he was a

2675
02:34:10.331 --> 02:34:12.360
different calling for him right now or I don't know.

2676
02:34:12.390 --> 02:34:14.880
I haven't talked to him in a while and then we need to get it back on here.

2677
02:34:14.881 --> 02:34:16.260
I don't know what he's up to these days.

2678
02:34:16.261 --> 02:34:18.280
Interested to know like he feel like with that

2679
02:34:18.860 --> 02:34:23.260
<v 3>his fighting was over and it was time for him to go to a new path and that's why</v>

2680
02:34:23.261 --> 02:34:26.560
he wasn't really worried about having the surgery and going there.

2681
02:34:27.030 --> 02:34:29.130
That make sense?
Yeah.
I don't know.
I mean,
look,

2682
02:34:29.410 --> 02:34:33.360
I think he probably would still like to compete every now and then if he didn't

2683
02:34:33.370 --> 02:34:34.203
get it worked out.

2684
02:34:34.270 --> 02:34:38.140
But I also believe that what he was saying was that that's not the most

2685
02:34:38.141 --> 02:34:39.070
important thing in the world.

2686
02:34:40.060 --> 02:34:43.570
And he also realizes how much of the goals that he wanted to achieve where ego

2687
02:34:43.571 --> 02:34:45.610
based ego centered share.

2688
02:34:45.640 --> 02:34:49.750
And one of the things that gets crushed when you have a really intense

2689
02:34:49.751 --> 02:34:52.990
psychedelic experience is the ego ego.
It always bounce backs,

2690
02:34:53.060 --> 02:34:56.590
bounced back a little.
I fight with my ego all the time.
It was every man does.

2691
02:34:56.591 --> 02:34:59.380
Of course.
It's part of like it's a part of it.

2692
02:34:59.380 --> 02:35:02.500
It's also part of the testosterone thing.
It's part of something x,

2693
02:35:02.501 --> 02:35:04.690
y chromosome thing.
It's part of the Dick thing.

2694
02:35:04.691 --> 02:35:08.560
It's part of the male identity thing.
You know,

2695
02:35:08.561 --> 02:35:12.070
there's a constant need to feel special,
you know,

2696
02:35:12.071 --> 02:35:15.060
to justify why you're doing what you're doing,
to do,

2697
02:35:15.061 --> 02:35:17.860
to reward yourself for what you've done.

2698
02:35:17.861 --> 02:35:22.120
And I encouraged further progress but that progress,
I mean that's,

2699
02:35:22.150 --> 02:35:27.150
that's what sort of like sort of pushes forth almost everything that men do in

2700
02:35:28.091 --> 02:35:32.710
this world.
And there's that weird balance where you're trying to,
you know,
be a,

2701
02:35:32.730 --> 02:35:37.450
uh,
sort of a enlightened person,
but also you're a man,
you know?

2702
02:35:37.451 --> 02:35:41.830
And it's like fighting against that.
It's fighting.
Yes,

2703
02:35:41.980 --> 02:35:46.140
but I prefer the term struggle.
Okay.
Right.

2704
02:35:46.630 --> 02:35:47.590
We're not even struggle,

2705
02:35:47.591 --> 02:35:52.510
but like it con is you constantly have to be aware of it.

2706
02:35:52.720 --> 02:35:57.400
You constantly have to be on alert and make sure that the Eagle never pops up.

2707
02:35:57.610 --> 02:35:59.830
You've got to constantly,
cause you know,

2708
02:35:59.831 --> 02:36:04.831
if you're under stress or if you're not diligent with your exercise and

2709
02:36:05.081 --> 02:36:08.380
meditation,
you can allow your thoughts to get away from you.
Oh,

2710
02:36:08.381 --> 02:36:11.590
in La and take over.
And then my other question was going to be,

2711
02:36:11.680 --> 02:36:15.550
so I find it really fascinating that you're saying that because I know women and

2712
02:36:15.551 --> 02:36:19.070
men think totally differently and I can tell you that,
right?
Sure.
Right.

2713
02:36:19.150 --> 02:36:24.150
My thought process changed the way I interact and people don't tend to realize

2714
02:36:24.221 --> 02:36:24.640
that.

2715
02:36:24.640 --> 02:36:28.420
Why I think men and women always have problems with each other in relationships.

2716
02:36:28.600 --> 02:36:30.730
Men's needs are different than women's needs.

2717
02:36:30.820 --> 02:36:34.420
And it's a reality that people don't want to talk about.
It's true.

2718
02:36:34.450 --> 02:36:37.870
It's like this.
Do you think that that is true?
Oh,
for sure.
Yeah.

2719
02:36:38.050 --> 02:36:41.970
I mean I assume it's true,
but it's true.
It's true.

2720
02:36:42.070 --> 02:36:46.090
And I think a lot of problems could be solved in the world as well as

2721
02:36:46.091 --> 02:36:50.470
relationships.
If people just are okay with that and they don't fight against it,

2722
02:36:50.471 --> 02:36:53.920
like the woman needs these sent things necessary for me to be happy in this.

2723
02:36:54.070 --> 02:36:55.000
And then the man needs this.

2724
02:36:55.001 --> 02:36:58.300
And it causes this huge conflict within that relationship,
whatever.

2725
02:36:58.301 --> 02:37:01.690
If it's a friendship or a marriage or whatever.
That's also with friendships too.

2726
02:37:01.691 --> 02:37:06.310
I mean,
some people require a lot.
A lot.
Yeah,
and some people don't,

2727
02:37:06.340 --> 02:37:11.230
and the people that require a lot don't hang out with them.
They're not worth it.

2728
02:37:11.500 --> 02:37:15.950
They're never worth it there.
Now you're telling me,
right,
they're never worth it.

2729
02:37:16.520 --> 02:37:19.820
<v 5>I don't care if they have golden pussy or Magic Dick,
whatever.</v>

2730
02:37:20.060 --> 02:37:22.270
After a while you're going to get bored.
No Way.

2731
02:37:22.320 --> 02:37:24.380
You have to feel like you're both getting that,

2732
02:37:24.381 --> 02:37:28.050
situate that and the people that require an exorbitant amount of attention,

2733
02:37:28.070 --> 02:37:31.300
exorbitant money,
they're out.
They're never worth it.
Way in the long run.

2734
02:37:31.301 --> 02:37:36.170
You're going,
I dated this girl once and she was so fucking dramatic.

2735
02:37:36.200 --> 02:37:39.500
Everything was a struggle and everything was against her and everything was

2736
02:37:39.800 --> 02:37:40.633
about her.

2737
02:37:40.660 --> 02:37:45.660
Everything that went well for someone had to be turned around to highlight how

2738
02:37:46.191 --> 02:37:49.640
bad her life has gone,
including things that would go well for me.

2739
02:37:49.790 --> 02:37:54.230
It would immediately turn into woe is me because I don't have anything good

2740
02:37:54.231 --> 02:37:55.850
going on in mine.
It was so brutal.

2741
02:37:55.940 --> 02:37:59.390
And we broke up and then I started dating this other girl who was really nice

2742
02:37:59.750 --> 02:38:04.750
and it was like I got an a balloon that was flying around the city and this

2743
02:38:05.010 --> 02:38:08.240
other girl was like friendly and she cracked jokes all the time and everything

2744
02:38:08.241 --> 02:38:11.560
was funny to her.
And I was like,
Oh,
crime,
any,

2745
02:38:13.190 --> 02:38:18.110
there's hope in the world.
It's like my soul was on a balloon,
like up,

2746
02:38:18.290 --> 02:38:22.400
up in a way.
Beautiful.
Beautiful.

2747
02:38:22.430 --> 02:38:25.610
But she connected with you now.
It wasn't just her being a woman.

2748
02:38:25.611 --> 02:38:29.350
I think there was a connection,
but the crazy one was better than people level.

2749
02:38:29.700 --> 02:38:34.340
The crazy one.
Batteries.
Crazy,
wild pitch water.
Fuck.
Like,
like a dog.

2750
02:38:35.240 --> 02:38:37.970
She wanted to just distract herself from her miserable mind.

2751
02:38:38.330 --> 02:38:41.990
So she wanted us to wild,
crazy fucking hair,

2752
02:38:41.991 --> 02:38:45.290
pulling madness.
She just wanted a growl.

2753
02:38:45.350 --> 02:38:47.870
That's pretty honest with the other one was just a sweetie,

2754
02:38:49.710 --> 02:38:51.170
you know.
And then again,

2755
02:38:51.171 --> 02:38:55.820
it's the balance of the fucking crazy world we live in is totally 100%.
The,
um,

2756
02:38:55.910 --> 02:39:00.730
the other problem is not just the men who,
um,
you know,

2757
02:39:00.950 --> 02:39:04.610
who think that they understand how women think and the women who think they

2758
02:39:04.611 --> 02:39:06.920
understand how men think is the people.

2759
02:39:07.060 --> 02:39:11.750
The other problem is the people who pretend to be someone else to placate the

2760
02:39:11.751 --> 02:39:15.800
opposite gender.
Oh my God,
that's so huge issue.
It happens all the time.

2761
02:39:16.550 --> 02:39:21.350
Those are the White Knights?
Yes.
The male male bitches of the world.

2762
02:39:21.380 --> 02:39:23.900
Well this guys who get together with like for example,

2763
02:39:23.901 --> 02:39:26.210
I have a obviously stripper friends.

2764
02:39:26.810 --> 02:39:31.010
Obviously I say obviously because I work in the sex industry.

2765
02:39:31.011 --> 02:39:34.070
Of course they have stripper friends and then like the guys get with the girls

2766
02:39:34.220 --> 02:39:36.590
and they don't want him to strip anymore.
That's hilarious.

2767
02:39:36.730 --> 02:39:40.560
It's all the time porn stars to right and points nurse can't do that anymore.

2768
02:39:40.940 --> 02:39:43.090
Like what the fuck is that all about?
Yeah.

2769
02:39:43.460 --> 02:39:47.160
Or they make weird rules like you're allowed to fuck other people but only or

2770
02:39:47.180 --> 02:39:51.470
you only,
it felt how difficult girls in front of me.
Only girls in front of me.

2771
02:39:51.620 --> 02:39:55.100
Or you can only fuck like a short list of guys that I'm friends with.
Exactly.

2772
02:39:55.370 --> 02:40:00.370
And they can't come in your face and we're going to get real specific

2773
02:40:01.310 --> 02:40:05.660
penetration on one woman,
Bro.
It's really,
that's ego stuff going.

2774
02:40:05.930 --> 02:40:09.020
It is.
But you know,
they say,
you mean if you,

2775
02:40:09.080 --> 02:40:12.380
if you really pay attention to the heavy duty psychedelic heads,

2776
02:40:12.410 --> 02:40:14.040
they say that at one point in time

2777
02:40:14.040 --> 02:40:18.240
<v 4>when people regularly consume psychedelics,
we were much more like chimpanzees.</v>

2778
02:40:18.241 --> 02:40:22.110
We had this orgiastic community,
small group,
you know,

2779
02:40:22.170 --> 02:40:25.680
50 to a hundred people and we all shared in fact,
um,

2780
02:40:25.920 --> 02:40:27.940
one of the guys that we have on the podcast all the time,

2781
02:40:27.941 --> 02:40:32.130
it's a guy named doctor Chris Ryan and he wrote a book called sex at dawn and

2782
02:40:32.131 --> 02:40:36.630
it's a fascinating book about the origins of human sexual interaction and his,

2783
02:40:36.900 --> 02:40:41.560
his take on is really,
first of all,
it's really well studied.
These,
uh,

2784
02:40:41.561 --> 02:40:44.970
secondly,
the,
the,
just the origin of words like promiscuous,

2785
02:40:45.180 --> 02:40:49.260
the original origin of promiscuous doesn't mean like having sex with random

2786
02:40:49.261 --> 02:40:53.070
people.
Like that never happened.
It means mixed,

2787
02:40:53.310 --> 02:40:57.840
mixed sexuality,
like having sex with several partners.
That was promiscuous,

2788
02:40:57.841 --> 02:41:00.090
but it was always people in the community.

2789
02:41:00.210 --> 02:41:02.790
It was always people that knew each other.
Right.

2790
02:41:02.820 --> 02:41:05.550
Cause there was only 50 of you and you're hanging out in the Amazon,

2791
02:41:05.730 --> 02:41:08.610
you know when you're shooting darts at monkeys and trying to stay alive and keep

2792
02:41:08.611 --> 02:41:09.930
that fire lit.
Right.

2793
02:41:09.990 --> 02:41:13.260
It wasn't like going to a club and picking some strange guy and letting them

2794
02:41:13.261 --> 02:41:17.970
come inside you.
That didn't happen.
They didn't allow strangers in the camp.

2795
02:41:17.971 --> 02:41:21.210
You know,
they didn't,
they didn't just go meet people and fuck.
Right.

2796
02:41:21.330 --> 02:41:23.180
It's like polyamory or something.
Yes.

2797
02:41:24.570 --> 02:41:27.570
It's also the idea exists in fighter pilots.

2798
02:41:27.571 --> 02:41:32.571
I was another really fascinating aspect of this guy's books that fighter pilots

2799
02:41:32.791 --> 02:41:35.310
and people in intense high risk,

2800
02:41:35.311 --> 02:41:37.860
high death rate jobs would often wife swap.

2801
02:41:38.460 --> 02:41:42.810
And the idea of the psychology behind it was the wife swapping was to ensure

2802
02:41:42.811 --> 02:41:44.850
that they're the one that they love so dearly.

2803
02:41:45.120 --> 02:41:48.330
It's not that they didn't want to have this connection only with them,

2804
02:41:48.450 --> 02:41:51.300
but they wanted other people to love them too because they probably wouldn't be

2805
02:41:51.301 --> 02:41:55.680
around.
Ah,
wow.
That's really fascinating.
Yes,

2806
02:41:55.681 --> 02:41:57.750
and it's very common amongst fighter pilots.

2807
02:41:57.751 --> 02:42:01.470
Like this is a switch that goes off when you're in this intense,
you know,

2808
02:42:01.471 --> 02:42:04.740
the odds of me dying or very hot odds of you dying,

2809
02:42:04.741 --> 02:42:08.280
or probably 30% or something crazy like that,
so I just made that up.

2810
02:42:08.280 --> 02:42:11.610
Then I know why it dropped 30% I had to define it.
That's what,
that's the,

2811
02:42:11.820 --> 02:42:14.880
that's the ego
having to come up with a number,

2812
02:42:15.270 --> 02:42:17.520
but that they do that on a regular basis.

2813
02:42:17.530 --> 02:42:20.970
That's a super common thing among soldiers.
Some police officers,

2814
02:42:21.210 --> 02:42:24.890
a lot of pickups wound up doing that and they totally do.
Yeah.
That's what it is.

2815
02:42:24.900 --> 02:42:27.090
That's what it's about.
It's about this.

2816
02:42:27.360 --> 02:42:32.310
There is a primal need to have your loved ones loved by others so that they'll

2817
02:42:32.311 --> 02:42:36.750
be safe when you're gone.
Wow.
That's really fascinating.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2818
02:42:37.140 --> 02:42:37.680
The human,

2819
02:42:37.680 --> 02:42:42.680
human sexuality morphs so much dependent upon circumstance tell,

2820
02:42:42.900 --> 02:42:45.090
you know something.
People don't,
they just think,
oh,

2821
02:42:45.210 --> 02:42:49.620
that's why people want guys especially need to go out.
It's part of your DNA.

2822
02:42:49.621 --> 02:42:53.190
It's part of,
you need to spread your seed.
It's very normal.

2823
02:42:53.191 --> 02:42:56.610
I think that guys go out and need to have sex with lots of different people.

2824
02:42:56.611 --> 02:43:01.440
I think it's part of explaining that to my wife or anybody I know.

2825
02:43:01.530 --> 02:43:03.180
I'm just kidding.
But you can't eat,

2826
02:43:03.750 --> 02:43:06.090
be okay with that if you did that or would she not be okay?

2827
02:43:06.120 --> 02:43:08.160
I think she'd probably be pretty sad.
Really?
Yeah.

2828
02:43:08.161 --> 02:43:11.710
No women don't want you to go fuck other guys or other girls

2829
02:43:12.010 --> 02:43:14.750
<v 3>now you can't be fucking,
you can't,</v>

2830
02:43:14.920 --> 02:43:17.950
well you don't want them to fuck other guys and they don't want you to fuck

2831
02:43:17.951 --> 02:43:21.550
other items and even if your DNA is telling you to go do it,
you know,

2832
02:43:21.570 --> 02:43:24.730
I know some people who are totally okay with that and they have a bunch of

2833
02:43:24.731 --> 02:43:27.010
strippers and free established this.

2834
02:43:27.430 --> 02:43:30.420
I know all the polyamory people who fuck each other.
I think um,

2835
02:43:30.490 --> 02:43:33.970
every man would certainly want that.
If it was a one way street,

2836
02:43:34.330 --> 02:43:38.020
but I think most men will.
Would you be okay with your wife fucking someone else?

2837
02:43:38.050 --> 02:43:40.210
No,
that wouldn't be nice.
Yeah,
I wouldn't enjoy that.

2838
02:43:40.630 --> 02:43:42.310
Now you're living in China when if you watch,

2839
02:43:42.730 --> 02:43:46.540
my question for you though is because you were a woman and now you're a man.

2840
02:43:46.550 --> 02:43:50.530
Right?
How has your thoughts on that changed?

2841
02:43:50.860 --> 02:43:52.210
You were always a lesbian though,

2842
02:43:52.930 --> 02:43:57.250
identified as a gay woman for my ears because I was the only thing I knew how I

2843
02:43:57.251 --> 02:44:01.750
could identify though I felt like a man.
Then when I told my lesbian community,

2844
02:44:01.960 --> 02:44:05.380
well,
I kinda feel like a man and I'm going to have this change.
They all got me.

2845
02:44:05.530 --> 02:44:09.220
I lost all my friends.
They were like,
you're a trader.
Basically.
They said,

2846
02:44:09.221 --> 02:44:12.940
I'm a trader.
Why?
Going to the bad side?
Wait a minute.

2847
02:44:13.390 --> 02:44:17.260
That was the actual,
oh yeah.
I actually said,

2848
02:44:17.261 --> 02:44:21.680
you're going to the other side totally dead.
And I was like dumped.

2849
02:44:22.270 --> 02:44:26.060
Wouldn't you think that people who have been marginalized,

2850
02:44:26.110 --> 02:44:30.100
I think that forced to just tow it up,

2851
02:44:30.400 --> 02:44:35.400
all sorts of prejudice and hurtful things that they would be more accepting.

2852
02:44:35.710 --> 02:44:39.160
You would think that that's a very good point.
What is wrong with,
well,

2853
02:44:39.210 --> 02:44:42.070
I guess 20 years ago,
I don't know if so many lesbians feel the way,

2854
02:44:42.071 --> 02:44:45.790
but I think that there is this whole thing going on in the gay women's community

2855
02:44:45.791 --> 02:44:48.310
where they feel sort of,
I don't know.
I actually,

2856
02:44:48.311 --> 02:44:51.430
I can't say anything about that because I've always wondered why they don't take

2857
02:44:51.431 --> 02:44:53.200
up real estate the way that gay men do.

2858
02:44:53.470 --> 02:44:56.770
Like gay men can fucking dominate an entire community.

2859
02:44:56.771 --> 02:45:01.750
It's a male and a male and female thing.
It certainly is of course the,
the,

2860
02:45:01.790 --> 02:45:05.020
the building of male communities,
like gay communities.
Yeah.

2861
02:45:05.050 --> 02:45:08.640
It's like they're like,
Ooh,
it's that.

2862
02:45:09.480 --> 02:45:11.600
It is like men need to do,

2863
02:45:11.650 --> 02:45:15.520
women are really much more passive and they're fine with that and they're fine

2864
02:45:15.521 --> 02:45:18.550
with their situation there.
They don't need to be making a big deal out of it.

2865
02:45:18.950 --> 02:45:19.240
I mean,

2866
02:45:19.240 --> 02:45:23.770
I know that you experienced prejudice and hate as a woman who's a gay woman,

2867
02:45:23.771 --> 02:45:28.060
but I think it's less so than gay men experience.
Yeah,

2868
02:45:28.061 --> 02:45:30.880
because they're less out there.
Right.
Like I just said,

2869
02:45:30.890 --> 02:45:35.260
that gay man are out there making that statement where the gay women are very

2870
02:45:35.261 --> 02:45:38.440
comfortable being in their environment and not really making a big deal.

2871
02:45:38.530 --> 02:45:41.440
But it's also like if gay women moved next door,

2872
02:45:41.470 --> 02:45:43.150
it wouldn't freak a lot of people out.

2873
02:45:43.270 --> 02:45:46.330
But if a gay man that interest or they would start going,
oh,

2874
02:45:46.331 --> 02:45:50.250
he's going to try to fuck me.
That's what it is right there,
man.
Totally.
Oh,

2875
02:45:50.300 --> 02:45:52.420
men don't want to feel like a a sex object.

2876
02:45:52.840 --> 02:45:54.610
I want to feel like they way they treat women,

2877
02:45:57.450 --> 02:46:00.340
but I think some men to other men,

2878
02:46:01.460 --> 02:46:03.070
if you're a straight man and you're like,
no,

2879
02:46:03.071 --> 02:46:04.300
that's not totally cool and you're not,

2880
02:46:04.480 --> 02:46:08.320
you're not affected by the gay women because you might want to watch the gay

2881
02:46:08.321 --> 02:46:10.070
women have sex.
Yeah.
The game women are no

2882
02:46:10.070 --> 02:46:12.960
<v 4>problem at all.
It's not a matter of fact.
Try to be friendly.
It's fine.</v>

2883
02:46:13.500 --> 02:46:18.020
I get invited over for the pioneers.
I'm just quiet here and it can be buds.

2884
02:46:19.100 --> 02:46:22.100
Well listen man,
this is a great conversation.
It's really,
really fun.

2885
02:46:22.101 --> 02:46:25.090
I'm glad we had it and uh,
I'm glad we covered,
you know,

2886
02:46:25.190 --> 02:46:28.450
so many of the various aspects of,
uh,
the,
the,

2887
02:46:28.451 --> 02:46:31.790
the world of transgender and gender identity and a,

2888
02:46:31.791 --> 02:46:35.690
I think a lot of people got a lot out of this.
At least I'd hope.

2890
02:46:37.700 --> 02:46:42.700

understand that,
you know,
it doesn't matter man.

2922
02:48:41.270 --> 02:48:45.100
We're bringing in Joey Diaz for sure.

uh,
the local posse,

just get as many people in here as possible and we'll all get lit up and we'll

really stupid and it's going to be excellent.

2930
02:49:03.451 --> 02:49:05.810
And I'll probably wind up being an animated thing online.
Uh,

2931
02:49:05.870 --> 02:49:09.390
so we'll for sure see you guys on Friday,
most likely.
