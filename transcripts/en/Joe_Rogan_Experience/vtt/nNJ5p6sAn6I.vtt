1
00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:06.170
<v Speaker 1>Which was really that excited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:08.900
<v Speaker 1>Hello,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any.</v>

3
00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:10.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How are you?</v>

4
00:00:10.571 --> 00:00:13.350
<v Speaker 1>A sports sunglasses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like those glasses.</v>

5
00:00:13.351 --> 00:00:14.450
<v Speaker 1>Glasses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sunglasses.</v>

6
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.500
<v Speaker 1>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is how I look in your face.</v>

7
00:00:16.501 --> 00:00:18.150
<v Speaker 1>Well thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a good choice.</v>

8
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.740
<v Speaker 1>We do have been flirting with me since I</v>
<v Speaker 1>arrived.</v>

9
00:00:19.741 --> 00:00:22.890
<v Speaker 1>A little bit casual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing weird.</v>

10
00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.010
<v Speaker 1>Just the way you button that shirt all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way up to the top.</v>

11
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.940
<v Speaker 1>That little top button.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Jean Jacket,</v>

12
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:30.360
<v Speaker 1>that Jay Leno's garage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look.</v>

13
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just came from dot Levins podcast.</v>

14
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:35.551
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

15
00:00:35.551 --> 00:00:39.470
<v Speaker 1>we were just talking about the fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd stopped you before we actually</v>

16
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.240
<v Speaker 1>talked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were just feeling like,</v>

17
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.850
<v Speaker 1>like this is more evidence that we are</v>
<v Speaker 1>living in a computer simulation.</v>

18
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.600
<v Speaker 1>Like everything is getting weirder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Politics is the most bizarre.</v>

19
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything is falling apart and it's</v>

20
00:00:50.911 --> 00:00:53.400
<v Speaker 1>like the Matrix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Programmers can't keep up with the code.</v>

21
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.240
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that maybe like when one or</v>
<v Speaker 1>two things go weird,</v>

22
00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:58.410
<v Speaker 1>like the election?</v>

23
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.880
<v Speaker 1>I think the election,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think having a reality star television</v>

24
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.570
<v Speaker 1>host guy who's a media mogul become the</v>
<v Speaker 1>president of United States is so odd to</v>

25
00:01:09.601 --> 00:01:14.601
<v Speaker 1>people that I think it gives us this</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling of instability and that feeling</v>

26
00:01:15.451 --> 00:01:18.330
<v Speaker 1>of instability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instability has like a ripple effect and</v>

27
00:01:18.331 --> 00:01:22.320
<v Speaker 1>it starts to fuck with all these other</v>
<v Speaker 1>aspects of our reality and then these</v>

28
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.360
<v Speaker 1>blurbs just start popping up and these</v>
<v Speaker 1>weirdnesses what's Kinda like rather</v>

29
00:01:27.361 --> 00:01:29.850
<v Speaker 1>than it being a proof that it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>simulation.</v>

30
00:01:29.851 --> 00:01:31.830
<v Speaker 1>This is the most reality we've had in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>long time.</v>

31
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.600
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we've all been living in this like</v>

32
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.090
<v Speaker 1>pseudo thi this theater of stability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that hype.</v>

33
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you've talked about</v>
<v Speaker 1>hypernormalization on this podcast</v>

34
00:01:39.511 --> 00:01:42.120
<v Speaker 1>before having to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the documentary,</v>

35
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.060
<v Speaker 1>it's real good if people haven't caught</v>
<v Speaker 1>up to it yet.</v>

36
00:01:45.061 --> 00:01:47.820
<v Speaker 1>It's on youtube and in its entirety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's dense.</v>

37
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.080
<v Speaker 1>It's not like a light.</v>

38
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.860
<v Speaker 1>It's not a light fun documentary is like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a three hour long British guide droning</v>

39
00:01:52.861 --> 00:01:55.170
<v Speaker 1>on too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like found footage on pvc.</v>

40
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.670
<v Speaker 1>But his basic point is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

41
00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.710
<v Speaker 1>society is unstable and has been for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>very long time.</v>

42
00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.570
<v Speaker 1>That greenland is melting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have nukes second,</v>

43
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.720
<v Speaker 1>destroy us at any point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there was no way for the leaders to</v>

44
00:02:09.721 --> 00:02:12.930
<v Speaker 1>actually run a functional and stable</v>
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>

45
00:02:12.931 --> 00:02:15.300
<v Speaker 1>So what they do instead is they put up</v>
<v Speaker 1>this artifice of stability.</v>

46
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.510
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit is fucking collapsing behind the</v>

47
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.520
<v Speaker 1>set and basically prove out example uses</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Soviet Union,</v>

48
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.550
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is like Soviet Union stopped working</v>

49
00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:27.720
<v Speaker 1>almost immediately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

50
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.750
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they tried this utopic communistic</v>

51
00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.390
<v Speaker 1>beautiful society and everything fell</v>
<v Speaker 1>apart immediately.</v>

52
00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.370
<v Speaker 1>Everybody knew what fell apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone in in,</v>

53
00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.320
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Russia knew it wasn't working,</v>

54
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.380
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it served them more to pretend that it</v>

55
00:02:40.381 --> 00:02:43.920
<v Speaker 1>was working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so people got into this willful,</v>

56
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.830
<v Speaker 1>a sort of voluntary suspension of</v>
<v Speaker 1>disbelief.</v>

57
00:02:46.831 --> 00:02:49.260
<v Speaker 1>This voluntary cognitive dissonance to</v>
<v Speaker 1>like say,</v>

58
00:02:49.261 --> 00:02:50.190
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything's good.</v>

59
00:02:50.191 --> 00:02:52.020
<v Speaker 1>Even though they go to the fucking the</v>
<v Speaker 1>store,</v>

60
00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.230
<v Speaker 1>there's no bread.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would just get.</v>

61
00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.130
<v Speaker 1>Everybody was walking around as if it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was real.</v>

62
00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.100
<v Speaker 1>So maybe when somebody like trump gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>elected this fake realness of like</v>

63
00:03:00.101 --> 00:03:01.720
<v Speaker 1>everything's good Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>

64
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.300
<v Speaker 1>What a wonderful place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A utopic society with all these</v>

65
00:03:04.301 --> 00:03:05.980
<v Speaker 1>freedoms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that rips the seam.</v>

66
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.860
<v Speaker 1>Then Anthony Rumble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Johnson retired from MMA</v>

67
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:11.643
<v Speaker 1>or something.</v>

68
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.280
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where do you go with that?</v>

69
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.870
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always been problems with</v>

70
00:03:19.871 --> 00:03:20.621
<v Speaker 1>society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

71
00:03:20.621 --> 00:03:23.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go back to ancient Rome,</v>

72
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you ever visited the coliseum?</v>

73
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:25.623
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

74
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:26.500
<v Speaker 1>Fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

75
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.400
<v Speaker 1>It crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

76
00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.640
<v Speaker 1>And when you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's only,</v>

77
00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're only talking about a thousand,</v>

78
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:32.890
<v Speaker 1>2000 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

79
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.650
<v Speaker 1>Like when did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when did it all start in Rome?</v>

80
00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.580
<v Speaker 1>Rome was around for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for 2000 years.</v>

81
00:03:39.581 --> 00:03:40.090
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

82
00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean there were like 10 times as long</v>
<v Speaker 1>as this American superpower has existed.</v>

83
00:03:44.231 --> 00:03:45.640
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

84
00:03:45.641 --> 00:03:47.440
<v Speaker 1>And they were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is they didn't have the</v>

85
00:03:47.441 --> 00:03:51.430
<v Speaker 1>technology to strip mine the world the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way we do technology has now caught up</v>

86
00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.080
<v Speaker 1>human evil or whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or human avarice has always been</v>

87
00:03:56.081 --> 00:03:57.220
<v Speaker 1>probably equal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

88
00:03:57.221 --> 00:04:01.660
<v Speaker 1>But my point was that there's never been</v>
<v Speaker 1>like any example of a society or a true</v>

89
00:04:01.661 --> 00:04:04.780
<v Speaker 1>Utopian society that was like really</v>
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>

90
00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:06.190
<v Speaker 1>very relaxed.</v>

91
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.290
<v Speaker 1>People are Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no war,</v>

92
00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:09.580
<v Speaker 1>there was no crime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no rape.</v>

93
00:04:09.581 --> 00:04:12.070
<v Speaker 1>There was no stealing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The best example of that is hippie</v>

94
00:04:12.071 --> 00:04:12.904
<v Speaker 1>communes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

95
00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.290
<v Speaker 1>Because they're specifically designed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>create a mini utopia and they always</v>

96
00:04:17.291 --> 00:04:21.310
<v Speaker 1>fall apart with a guy at the top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking everybody flies every time.</v>

97
00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:24.880
<v Speaker 1>It's never not happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A friend of mine's ex-girlfriend grew up</v>

98
00:04:24.881 --> 00:04:27.390
<v Speaker 1>in one of those and she was so fucked up</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of it.</v>

99
00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.900
<v Speaker 1>They're always fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

100
00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.410
<v Speaker 1>They're all the best you'll ever get out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a guy or a girl that grew up in one</v>

101
00:04:32.411 --> 00:04:34.570
<v Speaker 1>of those communes is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

102
00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.670
<v Speaker 1>it was in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was some really good parts that's</v>

103
00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.670
<v Speaker 1>as good as you can get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

104
00:04:39.671 --> 00:04:41.560
<v Speaker 1>And that's someone that's just really</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind.</v>

105
00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:43.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they,</v>

106
00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.330
<v Speaker 1>people always try to reengineer cycling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

107
00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.000
<v Speaker 1>I was reading something today about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

108
00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:53.170
<v Speaker 1>a free housing that free housing should</v>
<v Speaker 1>be a universal right for people that</v>

109
00:04:53.171 --> 00:04:54.370
<v Speaker 1>everyone should have free housing.</v>

110
00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.040
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was reading this was taking a shit</v>

111
00:04:57.041 --> 00:05:01.510
<v Speaker 1>so I didn't go into it too deeply,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that immediately I was thinking,</v>

112
00:05:01.511 --> 00:05:03.160
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's gonna build the housing.</v>

113
00:05:03.161 --> 00:05:05.080
<v Speaker 1>Like how is that a right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

114
00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.790
<v Speaker 1>it can't have a universal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

115
00:05:06.791 --> 00:05:10.150
<v Speaker 1>If some people just don't want to build</v>
<v Speaker 1>a house and they don't want to work and</v>

116
00:05:10.151 --> 00:05:12.430
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to do anything and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>want somebody else to build a house for</v>

117
00:05:12.431 --> 00:05:14.410
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's always going to be a possibility.</v>

118
00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.340
<v Speaker 1>Like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

119
00:05:15.341 --> 00:05:15.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

120
00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:16.601
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

121
00:05:16.601 --> 00:05:18.160
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what are rights rights are</v>

122
00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:19.750
<v Speaker 1>completely constructed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

123
00:05:19.751 --> 00:05:20.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure,</v>

124
00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:23.880
<v Speaker 1>a lion has no right to loan that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That should be a right,</v>

125
00:05:23.881 --> 00:05:27.730
<v Speaker 1>but the right to privacy rabbit of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lion or a ape has no rights.</v>

126
00:05:27.731 --> 00:05:30.070
<v Speaker 1>It's just an ape getting eaten and</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked by its neighbor.</v>

127
00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.920
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we decided what rights are so that.</v>

128
00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:36.190
<v Speaker 1>So the same idea that says something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything is a right.</v>

129
00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.360
<v Speaker 1>You could also say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

130
00:05:37.361 --> 00:05:38.370
<v Speaker 1>housing is a right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>

131
00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.450
<v Speaker 1>if society deems that that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

132
00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.420
<v Speaker 1>Or if society has the resources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do have the resources.</v>

133
00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.860
<v Speaker 1>That's true of right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think yeah,</v>

134
00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.130
<v Speaker 1>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine we have the rights or</v>

135
00:05:48.131 --> 00:05:50.450
<v Speaker 1>the resources rather than how's</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody in the car?</v>

136
00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.530
<v Speaker 1>Not In the best way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not a sweet apartment,</v>

137
00:05:53.531 --> 00:05:56.470
<v Speaker 1>but you know what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a roof over your head.</v>

138
00:05:56.471 --> 00:05:57.800
<v Speaker 1>Warmth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

139
00:05:57.801 --> 00:06:02.801
<v Speaker 1>I think like the idea that we were</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting way into the theoretics of</v>

140
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.010
<v Speaker 1>taxation and civil responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like the idea that we spend</v>

141
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:11.270
<v Speaker 1>trillions of dollars on a protective</v>
<v Speaker 1>military when we are,</v>

142
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.600
<v Speaker 1>we've lapped every other military so</v>
<v Speaker 1>many times over.</v>

143
00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:17.000
<v Speaker 1>Like we could everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every homeless person.</v>

144
00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean there are countries where they</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have homeless people,</v>

145
00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:19.640
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

146
00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:23.120
<v Speaker 1>They just don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been in Israel and it's like people</v>

147
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:26.450
<v Speaker 1>who are homeless in Israel or there are</v>
<v Speaker 1>homeless because they're crazy and want</v>

148
00:06:26.451 --> 00:06:29.640
<v Speaker 1>to be homeless or my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my brother was just in um,</v>

149
00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of those,</v>

150
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.740
<v Speaker 1>one of those super white countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Switzerland,</v>

151
00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.880
<v Speaker 1>I think it was Switzerland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everybody was like,</v>

152
00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:38.930
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't have.</v>

153
00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:39.831
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is crazy.</v>

154
00:06:39.831 --> 00:06:40.664
<v Speaker 1>What he told me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

155
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:41.990
<v Speaker 1>what's this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what society?</v>

156
00:06:41.991 --> 00:06:43.370
<v Speaker 1>Like you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's cool,</v>

157
00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:44.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't have like a poverty.</v>

158
00:06:44.991 --> 00:06:47.660
<v Speaker 1>So that's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they don't have poor people.</v>

159
00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not a part of their society.</v>

160
00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:51.980
<v Speaker 1>Is that Switzerland?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that.</v>

161
00:06:51.981 --> 00:06:53.840
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was Switzerland.</v>

162
00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:56.900
<v Speaker 1>They have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they figured out a way to make money on</v>

163
00:06:56.901 --> 00:06:58.640
<v Speaker 1>the Bank of Denmark is Kinda like that</v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

164
00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:00.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean northern Europe,</v>

165
00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:01.730
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've done something right.</v>

166
00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:02.900
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

167
00:07:02.901 --> 00:07:05.720
<v Speaker 1>I think they're also dealing with a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>small population of people that have</v>

168
00:07:05.721 --> 00:07:07.580
<v Speaker 1>existed for a long time in the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

169
00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:11.380
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you kind of normalize and they've</v>

170
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:13.210
<v Speaker 1>never conquered their conquerors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

171
00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:16.580
<v Speaker 1>they're not spreading their resources</v>
<v Speaker 1>thin across the globe,</v>

172
00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:18.620
<v Speaker 1>making battleships and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

173
00:07:18.621 --> 00:07:20.900
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about you on the way over</v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

174
00:07:20.901 --> 00:07:23.630
<v Speaker 1>I think this is connected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about you and the</v>

175
00:07:23.631 --> 00:07:27.950
<v Speaker 1>flirtation we were going to be doing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was wondering,</v>

176
00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.830
<v Speaker 1>because you're bent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've watched her stand up since trump</v>

177
00:07:30.831 --> 00:07:34.790
<v Speaker 1>got elected and you and a lot of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys at the store or I would say I've</v>

178
00:07:34.791 --> 00:07:36.890
<v Speaker 1>always taken the store,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a libertarian,</v>

179
00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:39.540
<v Speaker 1>a intellectual epicenter of comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

180
00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:43.520
<v Speaker 1>And then like if you go to go east it</v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes more and more like socialist</v>

181
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:45.380
<v Speaker 1>further to travel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

182
00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:47.820
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess what I'm the hot,</v>

183
00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:49.640
<v Speaker 1>it's like the neocons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at any rate,</v>

184
00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:52.820
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say your bent is like,</v>

185
00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.750
<v Speaker 1>everything's fucking fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

186
00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:57.050
<v Speaker 1>you're crying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're making a crisis that doesn't</v>

187
00:07:57.051 --> 00:07:57.884
<v Speaker 1>exist.</v>

188
00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:00.350
<v Speaker 1>And I was wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you still think that it's not</v>

189
00:08:00.351 --> 00:08:05.351
<v Speaker 1>necessarily really my bent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the way that it works now.</v>

190
00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:06.970
<v Speaker 1>That's a real comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

191
00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:09.350
<v Speaker 1>the community as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually I believe it's just one of the</v>

192
00:08:09.351 --> 00:08:11.900
<v Speaker 1>things that I say on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I say,</v>

193
00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:13.010
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

194
00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:15.170
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of the stuff I say it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked up.</v>

195
00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.230
<v Speaker 1>So if I say anything that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you don't agree with,</v>

196
00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:21.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't agree with a lot of Shit I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's funnier than when I agree with</v>

197
00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:26.720
<v Speaker 1>like some of the things I say clearly</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking around.</v>

198
00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:29.030
<v Speaker 1>And then some of the things I say it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like where's he,</v>

199
00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:33.370
<v Speaker 1>is he on the fence on this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what a lot of it is,</v>

200
00:08:33.371 --> 00:08:37.760
<v Speaker 1>is just to set up this idea that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole system has always been</v>

201
00:08:37.761 --> 00:08:38.840
<v Speaker 1>preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>

202
00:08:38.841 --> 00:08:41.240
<v Speaker 1>It's just that it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost our fault,</v>

203
00:08:41.241 --> 00:08:41.450
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

204
00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:46.450
<v Speaker 1>Because he'd take a guy like a Clinton</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a guy like an Obama who's fairly</v>

205
00:08:46.971 --> 00:08:51.971
<v Speaker 1>successful at the job and people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>just constantly trying to find chinks in</v>

206
00:08:52.041 --> 00:08:54.770
<v Speaker 1>the armor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly trying to find cracks in who</v>

207
00:08:54.771 --> 00:08:57.000
<v Speaker 1>he is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was Clinton and obviously it was</v>

208
00:08:57.001 --> 00:08:59.670
<v Speaker 1>the philandering with Obama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a chink,</v>

209
00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:04.440
<v Speaker 1>the size of a pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinks sounds like a weird word to use</v>

210
00:09:04.441 --> 00:09:08.400
<v Speaker 1>even if you're not using it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And erase the word niggardly got in</v>

211
00:09:08.401 --> 00:09:09.760
<v Speaker 1>trouble for saying niggardly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

212
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:11.190
<v Speaker 1>And they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't say that word.</v>

213
00:09:11.191 --> 00:09:13.010
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not even etymologically</v>

214
00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:14.670
<v Speaker 1>connected to the n word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we were like,</v>

215
00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.890
<v Speaker 1>we don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's spelled differently.</v>

216
00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:20.390
<v Speaker 1>Not the same root word that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't use it,</v>

217
00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:23.700
<v Speaker 1>but I feel that way about swastikas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know those hippy swastikas and</v>

218
00:09:23.701 --> 00:09:26.850
<v Speaker 1>the Indians Swastika and all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>hippies and am like,</v>

219
00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Buddhists are always like,</v>

220
00:09:28.111 --> 00:09:30.240
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a different spots to cuts a special</v>

221
00:09:30.241 --> 00:09:32.160
<v Speaker 1>swastika,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the good swastika.</v>

222
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:34.350
<v Speaker 1>It's like the good witch and the bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>witch from the wizard of Oz.</v>

223
00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:35.560
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alright,</v>

224
00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:38.910
<v Speaker 1>that's cool Buddhist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think you should just abandon the</v>

225
00:09:38.911 --> 00:09:40.760
<v Speaker 1>good swastika.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotta own.</v>

226
00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:44.370
<v Speaker 1>You've got other shit you could do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a symbol used in Okinawa and</v>

227
00:09:44.371 --> 00:09:45.810
<v Speaker 1>karate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

228
00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:48.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually it's made its rounds.</v>

229
00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:49.410
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because he was in India,</v>

230
00:09:49.411 --> 00:09:52.080
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a Hindu temples,</v>

231
00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.060
<v Speaker 1>Okinawa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's Buddhism,</v>

232
00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.650
<v Speaker 1>Hinduism to Buddhism to karate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like that.</v>

233
00:09:56.651 --> 00:09:57.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>

234
00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:01.740
<v Speaker 1>why it was in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I remember seeing it a long time ago</v>

235
00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:04.740
<v Speaker 1>in a store like this Okinawan karate</v>
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>

236
00:10:04.741 --> 00:10:08.340
<v Speaker 1>And there was this like these symbols</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was like this bizarre,</v>

237
00:10:08.341 --> 00:10:11.640
<v Speaker 1>like a swastika is a part of karate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it might've been reversed,</v>

238
00:10:11.641 --> 00:10:13.220
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they do it the opposite way,</v>

239
00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:15.420
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's symbols gone.</v>

240
00:10:15.421 --> 00:10:16.254
<v Speaker 1>You got to let that go.</v>

241
00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.830
<v Speaker 1>Well let's just abandon that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you could walk away from that with</v>

242
00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:21.300
<v Speaker 1>you got other symbols.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a lot like the Hitler</v>

243
00:10:21.301 --> 00:10:22.620
<v Speaker 1>mustache,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's no need.</v>

244
00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:26.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chaplain suffered,</v>

245
00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:29.190
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet Mr. Mr Miyagi was like,</v>

246
00:10:29.191 --> 00:10:30.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wax on,</v>

247
00:10:30.421 --> 00:10:32.400
<v Speaker 1>wax off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put that swastika on your shoulder.</v>

248
00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:35.160
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it funny that you could just</v>
<v Speaker 1>stretch that bitch just a little bit and</v>

249
00:10:35.161 --> 00:10:37.940
<v Speaker 1>you're okay if you just trim it just</v>
<v Speaker 1>light.</v>

250
00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:38.710
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about.</v>

251
00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:42.030
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as it's not the actual Hitler.</v>

252
00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:45.210
<v Speaker 1>If you just stretch it slightly towards</v>
<v Speaker 1>the corner of your mouth,</v>

253
00:10:45.211 --> 00:10:48.480
<v Speaker 1>you just keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just bring that bitch back like this.</v>

254
00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:51.720
<v Speaker 1>You're okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought you were being so vulgar for a</v>

255
00:10:51.721 --> 00:10:55.050
<v Speaker 1>second and that you just had the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>like pornography pornographic thought</v>

256
00:10:55.051 --> 00:10:55.831
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That crazy.</v>

257
00:10:55.831 --> 00:10:57.660
<v Speaker 1>If you just stretch that bitch just a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit,</v>

258
00:10:57.661 --> 00:10:58.050
<v Speaker 1>you're just.</v>

259
00:10:58.050 --> 00:10:59.400
<v Speaker 1>You're okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just stretch it.</v>

260
00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:00.960
<v Speaker 1>Stretch it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But his mouth.</v>

261
00:11:00.961 --> 00:11:02.440
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about a pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

262
00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:02.940
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

263
00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:04.350
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's weird that you just went there</v>

264
00:11:04.351 --> 00:11:05.700
<v Speaker 1>and we're talking about Hitler's</v>
<v Speaker 1>mustache.</v>

265
00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:06.780
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get turned on.</v>

266
00:11:06.781 --> 00:11:08.880
<v Speaker 1>When I think about the Nazis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a real,</v>

267
00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:11.690
<v Speaker 1>like some of the synopsis in my Jewish</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brain got cross.</v>

268
00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:13.380
<v Speaker 1>She called that desk the next special</v>
<v Speaker 1>mouth.</v>

269
00:11:13.381 --> 00:11:17.040
<v Speaker 1>Fucking Hitler</v>
<v Speaker 1>stretching Hitler's mouth.</v>

270
00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:19.860
<v Speaker 1>But isn't it a weird thing like that</v>
<v Speaker 1>mustache,</v>

271
00:11:19.861 --> 00:11:22.230
<v Speaker 1>like it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a certain amount of space it can</v>

272
00:11:22.231 --> 00:11:26.190
<v Speaker 1>cover on your lip and it's okay because</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as it goes far enough left and</v>

273
00:11:26.191 --> 00:11:27.030
<v Speaker 1>right where I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

274
00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:30.840
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the Hitlers haircut is making a</v>

275
00:11:30.841 --> 00:11:32.670
<v Speaker 1>huge comeback.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

276
00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:34.800
<v Speaker 1>And people get in trouble for that</v>
<v Speaker 1>haircut.</v>

277
00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:37.380
<v Speaker 1>I was the first guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I was on the first wave,</v>

278
00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:41.790
<v Speaker 1>I would say I was in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the first right of hipsters</v>

279
00:11:41.791 --> 00:11:42.840
<v Speaker 1>reclaiming that haircut.</v>

280
00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:46.170
<v Speaker 1>Well it's like a longer on the side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>write longer on the side,</v>

281
00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:48.980
<v Speaker 1>sort of puffy on the top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

282
00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:51.140
<v Speaker 1>you got rocky hit late night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to know this.</v>

283
00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:53.200
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've changed since because it got too</v>

284
00:11:53.201 --> 00:11:55.010
<v Speaker 1>cool and I truly am a hipster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I follow,</v>

285
00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:57.510
<v Speaker 1>I follow where the trends go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I used to have a,</v>

286
00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:01.270
<v Speaker 1>I used to have a bit about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the dilemma that a Jew has when</v>

287
00:12:01.271 --> 00:12:03.190
<v Speaker 1>he's telling a barbara what he wants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the only,</v>

288
00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:05.980
<v Speaker 1>the quickest way to describe it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just to say Hitler.</v>

289
00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:07.790
<v Speaker 1>So you want something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

290
00:12:07.791 --> 00:12:10.400
<v Speaker 1>like a kind of old timey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of a like a military cut like</v>

291
00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.550
<v Speaker 1>Hitler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hitler,</v>

292
00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:15.400
<v Speaker 1>the destroyer of my people make me look</v>
<v Speaker 1>like him.</v>

293
00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:18.190
<v Speaker 1>And then the punch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tag was as my grandparents turned</v>

294
00:12:18.191 --> 00:12:19.930
<v Speaker 1>over and they're shallow unmarked</v>
<v Speaker 1>graves.</v>

295
00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:21.990
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

296
00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:22.620
<v Speaker 1>let's start.</v>

297
00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:23.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was dark.</v>

298
00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:26.950
<v Speaker 1>But my point was originally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not really that I had a point,</v>

299
00:12:26.951 --> 00:12:31.951
<v Speaker 1>but when we chipping away at this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we know that politicians are doing</v>

300
00:12:32.411 --> 00:12:34.240
<v Speaker 1>an act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know that there when,</v>

301
00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always mocked the way they</v>

302
00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.710
<v Speaker 1>communicate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the way they give speeches,</v>

303
00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:43.120
<v Speaker 1>the long pauses in this very distinct</v>
<v Speaker 1>pattern of behavior that's completely</v>

304
00:12:43.121 --> 00:12:45.460
<v Speaker 1>alien to anything other than a political</v>
<v Speaker 1>speech.</v>

305
00:12:45.461 --> 00:12:48.580
<v Speaker 1>Like the only way this country survives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

306
00:12:48.581 --> 00:12:51.220
<v Speaker 1>like that kind of the strange thing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do.</v>

307
00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:53.440
<v Speaker 1>But when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we're always like chipping away at</v>

308
00:12:53.441 --> 00:12:55.430
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're always trying to like get to like</v>

309
00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:57.400
<v Speaker 1>be real key.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We gotta get,</v>

310
00:12:57.530 --> 00:13:01.540
<v Speaker 1>we gotta find out what's real and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>we get this guy who realer than anyone's</v>

311
00:13:01.541 --> 00:13:02.560
<v Speaker 1>ever been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

312
00:13:02.561 --> 00:13:03.970
<v Speaker 1>And we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well fuck this,</v>

313
00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:05.560
<v Speaker 1>this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it scares us.</v>

314
00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:09.130
<v Speaker 1>That's the point of that documentary we</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to be lied to.</v>

315
00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:14.260
<v Speaker 1>It makes us all feel calm and</v>
<v Speaker 1>comfortable to be given a stable lie</v>

316
00:13:14.261 --> 00:13:17.490
<v Speaker 1>than to be shown the real truth of how</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked up and unstable everything.</v>

317
00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:18.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the.</v>

318
00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:22.540
<v Speaker 1>The trailer has this text over over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like stock footage.</v>

319
00:13:22.541 --> 00:13:23.980
<v Speaker 1>It's just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's so scary.</v>

320
00:13:23.981 --> 00:13:28.720
<v Speaker 1>It's the words are a politicians lie to</v>
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>

321
00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:31.090
<v Speaker 1>We know they lie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they know,</v>

322
00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.340
<v Speaker 1>we know they lie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just don't care.</v>

323
00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:38.020
<v Speaker 1>And I just always sent chills down my</v>
<v Speaker 1>spine because it's so true and everybody</v>

324
00:13:38.021 --> 00:13:40.150
<v Speaker 1>knows it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yet we're all engaged in this</v>

325
00:13:40.151 --> 00:13:41.920
<v Speaker 1>willful suspension of disbelief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

326
00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:42.161
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

327
00:13:42.161 --> 00:13:43.090
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything's good.</v>

328
00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:44.253
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

329
00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:48.160
<v Speaker 1>both America's both the greatest country</v>
<v Speaker 1>on earth and it needs to be made great.</v>

330
00:13:48.161 --> 00:13:50.800
<v Speaker 1>Again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like we're all in this weird,</v>

331
00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:53.680
<v Speaker 1>like we're unclear on what were even</v>
<v Speaker 1>arguing for.</v>

332
00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:58.570
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like what trump's done is</v>
<v Speaker 1>put a totally new engine in the heart of</v>

333
00:13:58.571 --> 00:13:59.470
<v Speaker 1>the car.</v>

334
00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:04.890
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you have an old car like</v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington and it relies on a combustion</v>

335
00:14:05.081 --> 00:14:08.410
<v Speaker 1>engine and then someone comes along and</v>
<v Speaker 1>puts an electrical engine and then</v>

336
00:14:08.411 --> 00:14:08.831
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>

337
00:14:08.831 --> 00:14:09.250
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

338
00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:11.230
<v Speaker 1>what are you saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't need congress anymore.</v>

339
00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:13.450
<v Speaker 1>You don't need the Senate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't need this.</v>

340
00:14:13.451 --> 00:14:15.430
<v Speaker 1>You don't need that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't need the cronies.</v>

341
00:14:15.431 --> 00:14:19.750
<v Speaker 1>You don't need the lobbyists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have this whole new system and you</v>

342
00:14:19.751 --> 00:14:22.750
<v Speaker 1>don't need to pretend to talk like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even more importantly,</v>

343
00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:24.700
<v Speaker 1>you don't need to do the theatrics</v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

344
00:14:24.701 --> 00:14:27.340
<v Speaker 1>You can be a real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real terrible person who always wore</v>

345
00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:31.750
<v Speaker 1>and everybody goes along with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the weirdest thing to me about</v>

346
00:14:31.751 --> 00:14:33.640
<v Speaker 1>this election is not the president</v>
<v Speaker 1>himself,</v>

347
00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:39.370
<v Speaker 1>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how many people on line who you've</v>

348
00:14:39.371 --> 00:14:43.420
<v Speaker 1>never seen politically engaged are now</v>
<v Speaker 1>in it like like a,</v>

349
00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:46.350
<v Speaker 1>like a sports fan?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

350
00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:49.210
<v Speaker 1>I do understand well to the people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>hate trump.</v>

351
00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:51.770
<v Speaker 1>I understand because what it did was</v>

352
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:57.250
<v Speaker 2>it disrupted our programming on such a</v>
<v Speaker 2>profound level that people.</v>

353
00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:00.500
<v Speaker 2>I was talking to somebody last night</v>
<v Speaker 2>that said that it was much more</v>

354
00:15:00.501 --> 00:15:03.590
<v Speaker 2>disturbing when trump got elected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then nine slash 11 was to them,</v>

355
00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:09.580
<v Speaker 2>and I understand that sentiment because</v>
<v Speaker 2>nine slash 11 was a terrible event.</v>

356
00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:15.020
<v Speaker 2>This feels like a terrible new chapter</v>
<v Speaker 2>in American history,</v>

357
00:15:15.021 --> 00:15:18.380
<v Speaker 2>but nine slash 11 happened while Bush</v>
<v Speaker 2>was in office and Dick Cheney was the</v>

358
00:15:18.381 --> 00:15:20.960
<v Speaker 2>vice president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was one of the scariest guys to ever</v>

359
00:15:20.961 --> 00:15:22.650
<v Speaker 2>have no doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that is the.</v>

360
00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:24.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the best point that you're</v>

361
00:15:24.291 --> 00:15:29.120
<v Speaker 2>making is like Dick Cheney's pretending</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he's stable while meanwhile he's</v>

362
00:15:29.121 --> 00:15:33.590
<v Speaker 2>like Japan stowing evil in to bombing</v>
<v Speaker 2>Iraq and you know,</v>

363
00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:37.640
<v Speaker 2>do you want a guy that makes you feel</v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhat comfortable and stable?</v>

364
00:15:37.641 --> 00:15:42.260
<v Speaker 2>Who is actually the most evil Satan</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucker in the world or a guy that makes</v>

365
00:15:42.261 --> 00:15:44.900
<v Speaker 2>you feel the evil but isn't as bad.</v>

366
00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:47.400
<v Speaker 3>Way more transparent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His motivations.</v>

367
00:15:47.401 --> 00:15:49.580
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cheney was the ceo of Halliburton and</v>

368
00:15:49.581 --> 00:15:51.900
<v Speaker 3>then all sudden Halliburton wants to</v>
<v Speaker 3>bomb Iraq.</v>

369
00:15:51.901 --> 00:15:55.710
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he does rather they get these billion</v>

370
00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:56.790
<v Speaker 3>dollar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>multibillion dollar,</v>

371
00:15:56.791 --> 00:16:00.780
<v Speaker 3>no bid contracts to rebuild what they've</v>
<v Speaker 3>bombed and you're like,</v>

372
00:16:00.781 --> 00:16:03.000
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little kid can connect the dots here.</v>

373
00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:04.440
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is insane.</v>

374
00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:07.670
<v Speaker 2>I always just wonder what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much money do you want?</v>

375
00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:10.870
<v Speaker 2>I never quite get it like you're willing</v>
<v Speaker 2>to just in.</v>

376
00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:13.250
<v Speaker 2>It just seems too simple to me to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>

377
00:16:13.251 --> 00:16:15.050
<v Speaker 2>they just wanted money like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's,</v>

378
00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:17.180
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They all had a lot of money.</v>

379
00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:19.340
<v Speaker 2>When I talk to a big businessman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now</v>

380
00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:20.241
<v Speaker 3>you know what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

381
00:16:20.241 --> 00:16:22.370
<v Speaker 3>It's the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all about the deal.</v>

382
00:16:22.371 --> 00:16:24.140
<v Speaker 3>It's all about closing deals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>making deals,</v>

383
00:16:24.141 --> 00:16:25.250
<v Speaker 3>closing deals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and winning.</v>

384
00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:26.890
<v Speaker 3>That's what it's all about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

385
00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:30.650
<v Speaker 3>that's like saying to someone that loves</v>
<v Speaker 3>video games.</v>

386
00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:33.140
<v Speaker 3>Why are you playing video games?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like why are you playing them?</v>

387
00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:35.030
<v Speaker 3>You've already played.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You played it,</v>

388
00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:37.190
<v Speaker 3>you've got the game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know how to play a game.</v>

389
00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:40.310
<v Speaker 3>Why keep playing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because they're getting a little juice</v>

390
00:16:40.311 --> 00:16:42.500
<v Speaker 3>out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every time they do it at the closing</v>

391
00:16:42.501 --> 00:16:45.380
<v Speaker 3>deals or buying a new yacht.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got an amazing,</v>

392
00:16:45.381 --> 00:16:47.180
<v Speaker 3>amazing New York,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the biggest shot ever,</v>

393
00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:49.100
<v Speaker 3>so the most wonderful yacht,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the yacht.</v>

394
00:16:49.101 --> 00:16:50.840
<v Speaker 3>You'll see this yacht.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>

395
00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:52.400
<v Speaker 3>Wait to you see it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's incredible.</v>

396
00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:55.130
<v Speaker 3>The biggest yacht.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's trump at a nutshell,</v>

397
00:16:55.131 --> 00:16:55.540
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

398
00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:57.140
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do would you want the biggest yacht?</v>

399
00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:58.580
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't either.</v>

400
00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:00.410
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know a guy has one.</v>

401
00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:03.290
<v Speaker 3>It's a giant target.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to have like have these</v>

402
00:17:03.291 --> 00:17:05.920
<v Speaker 3>military guys at guard this fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing because he'll.</v>

403
00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:10.880
<v Speaker 3>What they'll do is they'll travel this</v>
<v Speaker 3>yacht without him just south of France</v>

404
00:17:11.570 --> 00:17:15.380
<v Speaker 3>and then he flies in private jet of</v>
<v Speaker 3>course flies in to the south of France</v>

405
00:17:15.381 --> 00:17:20.270
<v Speaker 3>and this private jet climbs out and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have to escort him to his gigantic</v>

406
00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:25.720
<v Speaker 3>multi hundred million dollar house that</v>
<v Speaker 3>floats in the water and you have to keep</v>

407
00:17:25.911 --> 00:17:29.450
<v Speaker 3>people from getting on your lawn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Essentially the like the lawn becomes</v>

408
00:17:29.451 --> 00:17:33.050
<v Speaker 3>all the water around your multibillion</v>
<v Speaker 3>dollar house or multimillion dollar</v>

409
00:17:33.051 --> 00:17:33.380
<v Speaker 3>house</v>

410
00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:35.960
<v Speaker 2>and it's just so that you can show your</v>
<v Speaker 2>other billionaire friends like,</v>

411
00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:39.050
<v Speaker 2>look what I got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it's also probably fun as fuck to</v>

412
00:17:39.051 --> 00:17:41.100
<v Speaker 2>take no doubt floating mansion</v>

413
00:17:41.850 --> 00:17:46.560
<v Speaker 3>out there on the south of France,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I guess it's just why else have the</v>

414
00:17:46.561 --> 00:17:47.394
<v Speaker 3>money?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

415
00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:50.130
<v Speaker 3>why not?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're balling and you enjoy</v>

416
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:52.740
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I guess they just want more.</v>

417
00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:54.660
<v Speaker 1>They just keep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep going.</v>

418
00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:59.130
<v Speaker 1>There's something more to it than just</v>
<v Speaker 1>the acquisition of money because once</v>

419
00:17:59.131 --> 00:18:02.430
<v Speaker 1>you have a billion dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can afford thing all of the things</v>

420
00:18:02.431 --> 00:18:04.020
<v Speaker 1>that you need or can afford.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All those things though.</v>

421
00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:06.600
<v Speaker 1>See One of these mansions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you,</v>

422
00:18:06.601 --> 00:18:11.601
<v Speaker 1>if you look at a mansion like a crazy</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking Hampton's mansion,</v>

423
00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:14.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could get one of those for like $50</v>

424
00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:15.960
<v Speaker 1>million,</v>
<v Speaker 1>$50 million,</v>

425
00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:18.480
<v Speaker 1>$100,000,000 before taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

426
00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:19.920
<v Speaker 1>Taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>expenses,</v>

427
00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:21.160
<v Speaker 1>sales tax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to makeup,</v>

428
00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:25.830
<v Speaker 1>you have to earn profit of $100,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get the $50,000,000 mansion and then</v>

429
00:18:25.831 --> 00:18:27.870
<v Speaker 1>that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not shit.</v>

430
00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:32.220
<v Speaker 1>Compared to some of these yachts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a yacht can go for half a billion.</v>

431
00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:35.070
<v Speaker 1>Like they have yachts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what's the most expensive yet we,</v>

432
00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:37.410
<v Speaker 1>we've covered this before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't it like a billion?</v>

433
00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:38.910
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a billion.</v>

434
00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:41.790
<v Speaker 1>A billion dollars for a boat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A billion dollar million dollar boat.</v>

435
00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:43.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then what we'll do,</v>

436
00:18:43.621 --> 00:18:46.470
<v Speaker 1>you have to have a jack about how empty</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel inside when you sit the first</v>

437
00:18:46.471 --> 00:18:48.630
<v Speaker 1>night and your billion dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It depends on how much coke you're</v>

438
00:18:48.631 --> 00:18:52.180
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might feel totally full full of coke</v>

439
00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:54.570
<v Speaker 1>and hookers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

440
00:18:54.571 --> 00:18:56.880
<v Speaker 1>you probably do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you have three phone calls going on</v>

441
00:18:56.881 --> 00:19:01.881
<v Speaker 1>at the same time doing deals and that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>why I 100 percent believe the reports of</v>

442
00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:05.670
<v Speaker 1>that streets of Monaco $1,000,000,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is crazy.</v>

443
00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:06.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

444
00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:10.140
<v Speaker 1>it's a castle on a boat that floats in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the water.</v>

445
00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:12.180
<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

446
00:19:12.181 --> 00:19:14.520
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a battleship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an aircraft carrier.</v>

447
00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:16.080
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really like a city.</v>

448
00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:18.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look how it's designed.</v>

449
00:19:18.271 --> 00:19:23.271
<v Speaker 1>I mean it looked the outside of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It all looks like this amazing block and</v>

450
00:19:23.311 --> 00:19:26.730
<v Speaker 1>what this is theoretical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they will build for someone if they</v>

451
00:19:26.731 --> 00:19:28.050
<v Speaker 1>give them a billion dollars.</v>

452
00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:29.370
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's see.</v>

453
00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:31.380
<v Speaker 1>The difference in a yacht and number</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

454
00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:35.250
<v Speaker 1>which is a $650,000,000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's triple the cost.</v>

455
00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:37.500
<v Speaker 1>What is a billion buying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will nothing yet.</v>

456
00:19:37.501 --> 00:19:39.090
<v Speaker 1>This one still in construction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The design,</v>

457
00:19:39.091 --> 00:19:41.550
<v Speaker 1>that fantastic yacht,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unlike the traditional model.</v>

458
00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:46.470
<v Speaker 1>So this is the probably the most.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so it's a replica of a casinos and</v>

459
00:19:46.471 --> 00:19:50.430
<v Speaker 1>the Monaco Grand Prix track.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so funny to me that you spend a</v>

460
00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:53.460
<v Speaker 1>billion dollars on something and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>looks that fucking Gadi and disgusting,</v>

461
00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:57.240
<v Speaker 1>like there's nothing about that that</v>
<v Speaker 1>looks cool other than it's billion this.</v>

462
00:19:57.540 --> 00:19:58.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the only.</v>

463
00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:02.040
<v Speaker 1>It looks cool because it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's mimicking Monaco number,</v>

464
00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:04.230
<v Speaker 1>but the number two one is how much that</v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

465
00:20:04.231 --> 00:20:07.350
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's foreign and $50 million to one</v>

466
00:20:07.351 --> 00:20:10.230
<v Speaker 1>point $2 billion and I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody with a billion dollar yacht</v>

467
00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:13.830
<v Speaker 1>should be murdered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I'm going out on a limb by</v>

468
00:20:13.831 --> 00:20:15.270
<v Speaker 1>saying that they should be killed.</v>

469
00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:17.850
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It costs a billion dollars.</v>

470
00:20:17.851 --> 00:20:20.700
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we don't know the exact cost of</v>
<v Speaker 1>building such a monstrosity,</v>

471
00:20:20.701 --> 00:20:23.490
<v Speaker 1>but various source of listed the price</v>
<v Speaker 1>of construction.</v>

472
00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:28.230
<v Speaker 1>Even as high as one point 5 billion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's manned by 70 crew members and owned</v>

473
00:20:28.231 --> 00:20:32.910
<v Speaker 1>by Russian billionaire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roman Abramovich contains its own</v>

474
00:20:32.911 --> 00:20:37.080
<v Speaker 1>private defense system designed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>detect intruders and camera wielding</v>

475
00:20:37.081 --> 00:20:39.210
<v Speaker 1>spectators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

476
00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:41.760
<v Speaker 1>It's got a laser to kill to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We get that.</v>

477
00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:44.850
<v Speaker 1>It uses modern light technology to block</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cameras.</v>

478
00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:50.660
<v Speaker 1>Is Room for 24 to hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>IPADS and has its own private submarine.</v>

479
00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:53.320
<v Speaker 1>By the time you get the private</v>
<v Speaker 1>submarine money,</v>

480
00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:56.260
<v Speaker 1>something's gone very right and very</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong in your life,</v>

481
00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:58.450
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a Russian billionaire,</v>

482
00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:00.790
<v Speaker 1>you have to be in bed with Putin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

483
00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:01.780
<v Speaker 1>you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

484
00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:04.660
<v Speaker 1>You can't just like be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just politically agnostic.</v>

485
00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:08.510
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll be straight up drinking a arsenic</v>

486
00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:11.350
<v Speaker 1>at some point or they'll just take your</v>
<v Speaker 1>company and lock you up.</v>

487
00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:12.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've done that to a bunch of</v>

488
00:21:12.641 --> 00:21:15.010
<v Speaker 1>oligarchs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd just takes your company,</v>

489
00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:17.770
<v Speaker 1>puts you in the pokey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I wonder,</v>

490
00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:20.230
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think that you can be that there</v>

491
00:21:20.231 --> 00:21:20.751
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

492
00:21:20.751 --> 00:21:23.560
<v Speaker 1>I guess like Bill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill Gates and Warren Buffet seemed like</v>

493
00:21:23.561 --> 00:21:25.570
<v Speaker 1>Nice people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it seems like if you're a</v>

494
00:21:25.571 --> 00:21:28.870
<v Speaker 1>billionaire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're probably like at least a cousin</v>

495
00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:31.750
<v Speaker 1>of evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you've done something terrible.</v>

496
00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:33.250
<v Speaker 1>Is that true though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

497
00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:35.920
<v Speaker 1>it's got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's gotta be a way to be an ethical</v>

498
00:21:35.921 --> 00:21:39.010
<v Speaker 1>billionaire if there is a way to make a</v>
<v Speaker 1>million dollars ethically,</v>

499
00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:41.650
<v Speaker 1>which we believe there is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's gotta be a way to make a</v>

500
00:21:41.651 --> 00:21:42.461
<v Speaker 1>billion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

501
00:21:42.461 --> 00:21:45.670
<v Speaker 1>it's just a matter of keeping going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

502
00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:48.620
<v Speaker 1>Buffet seems like a good guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you get into what good guy</v>

503
00:21:48.621 --> 00:21:50.170
<v Speaker 1>means for a billionaire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

504
00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:52.510
<v Speaker 1>Like good buffets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good guy is like,</v>

505
00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:56.590
<v Speaker 1>I will allow $800,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million to go to AIDS in Africa,</v>

506
00:21:56.770 --> 00:22:01.000
<v Speaker 1>but I will not allow that same 800</v>
<v Speaker 1>million to go to famine in Somalia.</v>

507
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.620
<v Speaker 1>So there's a kind of a weird moral</v>
<v Speaker 1>arbiter thing that happens which happens</v>

508
00:22:05.621 --> 00:22:08.140
<v Speaker 1>to the president to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like when people point out that</v>

509
00:22:08.141 --> 00:22:10.830
<v Speaker 1>like Obama bombed people with drones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

510
00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:13.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was pretty disgusted by a lot of</v>

511
00:22:13.271 --> 00:22:16.090
<v Speaker 1>things Obama did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like that is part of the</v>

512
00:22:16.091 --> 00:22:20.230
<v Speaker 1>morality of being a world leader is you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to be comfortable with a morality</v>

513
00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:24.670
<v Speaker 1>that includes killing innocent people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why I would never want to be</v>

514
00:22:24.671 --> 00:22:27.910
<v Speaker 1>the leader of anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only one reason why there's a ton of</v>

515
00:22:27.911 --> 00:22:29.500
<v Speaker 1>reasons why you'd never want to do that</v>
<v Speaker 1>job.</v>

516
00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:30.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The worst.</v>

517
00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:31.773
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

518
00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:34.240
<v Speaker 1>there's this idea that people love the</v>
<v Speaker 1>president,</v>

519
00:22:34.241 --> 00:22:37.000
<v Speaker 1>which also like really kind of blows my</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>

520
00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:40.480
<v Speaker 1>Like why do we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do we love our president?</v>

521
00:22:40.481 --> 00:22:42.310
<v Speaker 1>They don't love the president in every</v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

522
00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:46.150
<v Speaker 1>There was a super disturbing video that</v>
<v Speaker 1>a guy no took where he was at the</v>

523
00:22:46.151 --> 00:22:51.151
<v Speaker 1>inauguration and trump is coming up the</v>
<v Speaker 1>stairs and as trauma's coming stairs,</v>

524
00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:52.540
<v Speaker 1>all supporters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

525
00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:53.403
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

526
00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:54.141
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

527
00:22:54.141 --> 00:22:57.160
<v Speaker 1>the heart of his love and as he's coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>up the stairs,</v>

528
00:22:57.161 --> 00:23:02.161
<v Speaker 1>people are clapping and applauding and</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy next to this guy I know who's</v>

529
00:23:02.651 --> 00:23:05.290
<v Speaker 1>holding the camera says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you,</v>

530
00:23:05.291 --> 00:23:07.780
<v Speaker 1>Mr Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are a godsend.</v>

531
00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:10.930
<v Speaker 1>Thank you sir.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much.</v>

532
00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:13.810
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he barely acknowledges that guy of</v>

533
00:23:13.811 --> 00:23:16.420
<v Speaker 1>course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just because it was $100 million people.</v>

534
00:23:16.421 --> 00:23:19.300
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he wanders up the stairs and goes</v>

535
00:23:19.301 --> 00:23:22.090
<v Speaker 1>through the room and all these people</v>
<v Speaker 1>are following him with the camera on</v>

536
00:23:22.091 --> 00:23:24.160
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what a guy like that once</v>

537
00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:26.460
<v Speaker 1>he wants somebody to say that to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

538
00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:29.920
<v Speaker 1>He wants to be that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand actually being trucked in</v>

539
00:23:29.921 --> 00:23:31.630
<v Speaker 1>that situation and want people to</v>
<v Speaker 1>worship you.</v>

540
00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:32.860
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can get there.</v>

541
00:23:32.861 --> 00:23:36.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm a comedian that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's close enough to a desperate ego</v>

542
00:23:36.011 --> 00:23:38.530
<v Speaker 1>where you like laugh at me is similar to</v>
<v Speaker 1>worship me,</v>

543
00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:44.280
<v Speaker 1>but why do we worship politicians?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't wrap my brain around it.</v>

544
00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:45.980
<v Speaker 1>Like Gore Vidal</v>

545
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:50.980
<v Speaker 3>said that he called it the uniquely</v>
<v Speaker 3>American religion of worshiping the</v>

546
00:23:52.161 --> 00:23:53.300
<v Speaker 3>president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

547
00:23:53.301 --> 00:23:56.270
<v Speaker 3>I think it goes back to the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've never had a king,</v>

548
00:23:56.630 --> 00:24:00.620
<v Speaker 3>so our president is a different thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think the idea to have the one</v>

549
00:24:00.621 --> 00:24:04.130
<v Speaker 3>alpha is just some ancient ape shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

550
00:24:04.131 --> 00:24:06.590
<v Speaker 3>One hundred percent does only makes</v>
<v Speaker 3>sense.</v>

551
00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:10.370
<v Speaker 3>There's always an Alpha champ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's an Alpha gorilla and there's</v>

552
00:24:10.371 --> 00:24:13.880
<v Speaker 3>just like these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these hierarchies exist in the primitive</v>

553
00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:16.880
<v Speaker 3>versions of us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why wouldn't they exist in the most</v>

554
00:24:16.881 --> 00:24:18.110
<v Speaker 3>advanced?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's really interesting.</v>

555
00:24:18.111 --> 00:24:19.830
<v Speaker 3>I never thought about it like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like A,</v>

556
00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:25.030
<v Speaker 3>we're so intelligent that we've created</v>
<v Speaker 3>a stratified Alpha pyramid that is $300</v>

557
00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:28.970
<v Speaker 3>million big with a parliamentary system</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a constitution,</v>

558
00:24:28.971 --> 00:24:31.910
<v Speaker 3>but it's still just a bunch of apes know</v>
<v Speaker 3>running around,</v>

559
00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:33.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>2001 in.</v>

560
00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:34.640
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even like,</v>

561
00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:36.710
<v Speaker 3>go back to what we're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Bill Gates,</v>

562
00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:39.340
<v Speaker 3>who's this in incredibly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

563
00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:41.340
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

564
00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:43.760
<v Speaker 3>what he's done charitably is amazing.</v>

565
00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:48.740
<v Speaker 3>He does a lot of great stuff with his</v>
<v Speaker 3>money mean their foundation is really,</v>

566
00:24:48.741 --> 00:24:53.741
<v Speaker 3>really beneficial to a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but everybody knows him as the king ape</v>

567
00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:55.700
<v Speaker 3>of Microsoft.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

568
00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:59.360
<v Speaker 3>that's how these businesses work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tim Cook,</v>

569
00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:02.220
<v Speaker 3>that's the king eight of Apple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

570
00:25:02.250 --> 00:25:05.110
<v Speaker 3>we always have a king ape or queen ape,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

571
00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:08.710
<v Speaker 3>Very rarely a queen a put when we have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't seem to work out.</v>

572
00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:12.750
<v Speaker 3>When named Queen Eight that Toronto is</v>
<v Speaker 3>chick was a big queen a,</v>

573
00:25:12.751 --> 00:25:15.020
<v Speaker 3>but it didn't work out because it turns</v>
<v Speaker 3>out she was a fraud.</v>

574
00:25:15.021 --> 00:25:16.840
<v Speaker 3>Who's Toronto's?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to story.</v>

575
00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:17.571
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

576
00:25:17.571 --> 00:25:19.310
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing story.</v>

577
00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:24.580
<v Speaker 3>It's a story of something where people</v>
<v Speaker 3>wanted something to be true.</v>

578
00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:29.380
<v Speaker 3>So they kind of said yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We finally have and they didn't do any</v>

579
00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:32.930
<v Speaker 3>investigating on it until finally</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody actually did.</v>

580
00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:34.760
<v Speaker 3>I think it might've been the Wall Street</v>
<v Speaker 3>Journal.</v>

581
00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:35.600
<v Speaker 3>It took it down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

582
00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:39.230
<v Speaker 3>I was just woman Elizabeth something or</v>
<v Speaker 3>another.</v>

583
00:25:39.231 --> 00:25:41.450
<v Speaker 3>She,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she founded this company called Toronto.</v>

584
00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:43.190
<v Speaker 3>There she is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Elizabeth Holmes,</v>

585
00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:47.240
<v Speaker 3>and she dressed like Steve Jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She wore a black turtleneck black stuff.</v>

586
00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:52.480
<v Speaker 3>She acted like she was this super genius</v>
<v Speaker 3>character and when she was 19 she left</v>

587
00:25:53.721 --> 00:25:56.260
<v Speaker 3>college to start this company called</v>
<v Speaker 3>Toronto.</v>

588
00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:59.930
<v Speaker 3>And Toronto is a company that would do</v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

589
00:25:59.931 --> 00:26:04.931
<v Speaker 3>I'm very cheap and effective blood scan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they would take a drop of your</v>

590
00:26:06.411 --> 00:26:11.330
<v Speaker 3>blood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>prick your blood and test you for all</v>

591
00:26:11.331 --> 00:26:13.480
<v Speaker 3>sorts of different diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

592
00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:16.160
<v Speaker 3>it turns out it doesn't work at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a black box.</v>

593
00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:18.500
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just hugely ineffective.</v>

594
00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:23.960
<v Speaker 3>And she was worth in one point in time</v>
<v Speaker 3>$34 billion dollars because of what this</v>

595
00:26:23.961 --> 00:26:28.961
<v Speaker 3>company was assessed as being valued at</v>
<v Speaker 3>which she could have been able to do.</v>

596
00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:32.780
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it turned out that they started looking</v>

597
00:26:32.781 --> 00:26:34.880
<v Speaker 3>into it and then there was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>whistleblower from the company that was</v>

598
00:26:34.881 --> 00:26:37.520
<v Speaker 3>saying that she was ignoring all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>negatives and concentrate on the</v>

599
00:26:37.521 --> 00:26:40.220
<v Speaker 3>positives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And these people know untold,</v>

600
00:26:40.670 --> 00:26:42.650
<v Speaker 3>tens of thousands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And even,</v>

601
00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:44.070
<v Speaker 3>I think maybe even a</v>

602
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:46.620
<v Speaker 1>million people were put it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many people find out how many people</v>

603
00:26:46.621 --> 00:26:50.760
<v Speaker 1>were tested by this shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they were all put at risk because</v>

604
00:26:50.761 --> 00:26:53.130
<v Speaker 1>it's hugely effective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like off by like 40,</v>

605
00:26:53.131 --> 00:26:56.550
<v Speaker 1>50 percent negatives and positives and</v>
<v Speaker 1>just wasn't right.</v>

606
00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:59.610
<v Speaker 1>It just was wrong all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does this idea that she was going to</v>

607
00:26:59.611 --> 00:27:03.240
<v Speaker 1>bypass this traditional system and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were putting them in like walgreens and</v>

608
00:27:03.241 --> 00:27:06.210
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that and allowing people to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get tested and screened for all these</v>

609
00:27:06.211 --> 00:27:11.211
<v Speaker 1>diseases and it really wasn't effective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she was one of the very rare king</v>

610
00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:15.450
<v Speaker 1>queen chimps were the matriarchal</v>
<v Speaker 1>society was,</v>

611
00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:17.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her business and it didn't work.</v>

612
00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:20.010
<v Speaker 1>You conflating the collapse of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>business to know.</v>

613
00:27:20.011 --> 00:27:22.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying she was the only one</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I can think of.</v>

614
00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:25.240
<v Speaker 1>What would that have been very effective</v>
<v Speaker 1>female world leaders though.</v>

615
00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:26.660
<v Speaker 1>Top,</v>

00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:23.380
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

637
00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:24.670
<v Speaker 1>it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

638
00:28:24.671 --> 00:28:26.590
<v Speaker 1>Margaret Thatcher is a good example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

639
00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:29.670
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like companies like lily,</v>

640
00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:31.360
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about like Bill Gates</v>
<v Speaker 1>and stuff like that.</v>

641
00:28:31.361 --> 00:28:33.310
<v Speaker 1>You never see that rent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

642
00:28:33.311 --> 00:28:35.580
<v Speaker 1>at the top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the top of a Qa.</v>

643
00:28:35.650 --> 00:28:39.790
<v Speaker 1>Carly Fiorina you got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was the head of,</v>

644
00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:42.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she ran the Republican,</v>

645
00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:47.270
<v Speaker 1>one of the Republican people that ran</v>
<v Speaker 1>for president this and she was at</v>

646
00:28:47.530 --> 00:28:51.570
<v Speaker 1>Hewlett Packard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted something like that maybe.</v>

647
00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:54.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think it is?</v>

648
00:28:54.911 --> 00:28:57.100
<v Speaker 1>You really think it's just an ape shit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

649
00:28:57.101 --> 00:28:59.530
<v Speaker 1>I think there's definitely some women</v>
<v Speaker 1>that have a more masculine</v>

650
00:28:59.531 --> 00:29:04.531
<v Speaker 1>characteristics and enjoy the</v>
<v Speaker 1>competition of the board room and that</v>

651
00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:09.370
<v Speaker 1>kind of stuff more than some women do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that a day.</v>

652
00:29:09.371 --> 00:29:12.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the country was at Pakistan,</v>

653
00:29:12.911 --> 00:29:13.481
<v Speaker 1>Pakistan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

654
00:29:13.481 --> 00:29:15.310
<v Speaker 1>I was gonna say Pakistan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but didn't want to fuck it up.</v>

655
00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:19.280
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

656
00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:20.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

657
00:29:20.471 --> 00:29:22.720
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is a masculine characteristics?</v>

658
00:29:22.721 --> 00:29:26.610
<v Speaker 1>What's a feminine characteristics?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously there's massive variations in,</v>

659
00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:30.340
<v Speaker 1>in both genders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but why are almost all lead?</v>

660
00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:32.170
<v Speaker 1>It's the patriarchy man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

661
00:29:32.171 --> 00:29:34.870
<v Speaker 1>it is the patriarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it is.</v>

662
00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:37.090
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What it means is that therapists,</v>

663
00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:42.200
<v Speaker 1>there are systems in place and maybe are</v>
<v Speaker 1>biological systems is what suggesting</v>

664
00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:44.320
<v Speaker 2>it's a primary thing and maybe their</v>
<v Speaker 2>societal systems.</v>

665
00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:47.800
<v Speaker 2>Probably the truth is that they're both.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that a person that really</v>

666
00:29:47.801 --> 00:29:51.610
<v Speaker 2>believes in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in like feminism and patriarchy would</v>

667
00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:54.160
<v Speaker 2>say the societal systems are more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are the bigger,</v>

668
00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:55.820
<v Speaker 2>the bigger issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

669
00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:58.090
<v Speaker 2>but even you can believe in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>patriarchy that's biological,</v>

670
00:29:58.091 --> 00:30:01.570
<v Speaker 2>but just that it's more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a barrier to entry that starts</v>

671
00:30:01.690 --> 00:30:05.020
<v Speaker 2>in kindergarten.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It starts in child rearing that would,</v>

672
00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:06.250
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that every,</v>

673
00:30:06.550 --> 00:30:11.550
<v Speaker 2>in order for a woman to become a CEO,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to have to jump every hoop</v>

674
00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:16.480
<v Speaker 2>higher than the male that want is on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same path because there are systems or</v>

675
00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:21.240
<v Speaker 2>structural systems in place that want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>snip smack that woman down towards like</v>

676
00:30:21.250 --> 00:30:25.390
<v Speaker 2>a more what is perceived as a no do</v>
<v Speaker 2>something a little bit more feminine.</v>

677
00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:27.040
<v Speaker 2>And so they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in order to be,</v>

678
00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:30.790
<v Speaker 2>it's this idea that is true with all</v>
<v Speaker 2>oppressed people that in order to be</v>

679
00:30:30.791 --> 00:30:32.080
<v Speaker 2>average you have to be great.</v>

680
00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:34.360
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw that directly with like my mother</v>

681
00:30:34.510 --> 00:30:37.820
<v Speaker 2>who's a deaf and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in order I just,</v>

682
00:30:37.930 --> 00:30:40.090
<v Speaker 2>the deaf community is so fascinating and</v>
<v Speaker 2>weird,</v>

683
00:30:40.091 --> 00:30:42.940
<v Speaker 2>but like in order to be what my mother</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

684
00:30:42.941 --> 00:30:44.740
<v Speaker 2>which is like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she has a master's degree and she's</v>

685
00:30:44.741 --> 00:30:48.430
<v Speaker 2>college educated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to try 20 times as hard as an</v>

686
00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:51.310
<v Speaker 2>average person that wants to get a</v>
<v Speaker 2>master's degree because there's so much</v>

687
00:30:51.311 --> 00:30:55.330
<v Speaker 2>insane barrier to entry from day one</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the first day you were born.</v>

688
00:30:56.170 --> 00:30:59.830
<v Speaker 2>So I think that's the patriarchy I don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>think is really up for debate.</v>

689
00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:02.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean even if you believe just in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>biological imperative,</v>

690
00:31:03.170 --> 00:31:07.480
<v Speaker 2>men are in charge and therefore they</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep women from getting to positions of</v>

691
00:31:07.481 --> 00:31:09.460
<v Speaker 2>being in charge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in order to get up there,</v>

692
00:31:09.461 --> 00:31:12.520
<v Speaker 2>in order to be a ceo you have to be more</v>
<v Speaker 2>aggressive,</v>

693
00:31:12.550 --> 00:31:14.970
<v Speaker 2>more powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more more Steve Jobs,</v>

694
00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:17.260
<v Speaker 2>you gotta put a put more turtle necks</v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

695
00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:18.430
<v Speaker 3>Well yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But is that,</v>

696
00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:23.700
<v Speaker 3>is that the actual system that's in</v>
<v Speaker 3>place or are there far more men who want</v>

697
00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:25.090
<v Speaker 3>to do that job?</v>

698
00:31:25.570 --> 00:31:27.640
<v Speaker 2>But why would there be more men that</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to do the job?</v>

699
00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:29.020
<v Speaker 2>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it</v>

700
00:31:29.030 --> 00:31:30.290
<v Speaker 3>natural?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

701
00:31:30.291 --> 00:31:34.370
<v Speaker 3>is it natural for women to gravitate</v>
<v Speaker 3>towards nursing and physicians and,</v>

702
00:31:34.371 --> 00:31:38.060
<v Speaker 3>and healthcare because that is</v>
<v Speaker 3>overwhelmingly run by women,</v>

703
00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:40.400
<v Speaker 2>but then why are they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

704
00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:43.550
<v Speaker 2>why aren't they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't they gravitate towards being a</v>

705
00:31:43.551 --> 00:31:46.520
<v Speaker 2>doctor if there is a lot of women do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

706
00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:47.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

707
00:31:47.090 --> 00:31:51.350
<v Speaker 2>but doc be being a doctor is largely and</v>
<v Speaker 2>historically dominated by men and there</v>

708
00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:54.460
<v Speaker 2>something that's the case anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might not be anymore.</v>

709
00:31:54.770 --> 00:31:55.340
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

710
00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:58.430
<v Speaker 2>I guess what I'm saying is like if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at a woman and say,</v>

711
00:31:58.460 --> 00:31:58.881
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well they,</v>

712
00:31:58.881 --> 00:32:01.880
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are biologically predisposed to</v>

713
00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:03.770
<v Speaker 2>nurture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you would say,</v>

714
00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:04.311
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

715
00:32:04.311 --> 00:32:07.250
<v Speaker 2>Then it would make sense that all of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>great doctors of history would have been</v>

716
00:32:07.251 --> 00:32:09.110
<v Speaker 2>women or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or it would have been dominated in the</v>

717
00:32:09.111 --> 00:32:09.950
<v Speaker 2>same way nursing has.</v>

718
00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:13.130
<v Speaker 3>Well not necessarily because a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the great doctors in history,</v>

719
00:32:13.131 --> 00:32:17.330
<v Speaker 3>you're talking a lot about science.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about the ability to</v>

720
00:32:17.390 --> 00:32:22.390
<v Speaker 3>recognize issues before anyone else does</v>
<v Speaker 3>and try to like formulate some sort of a</v>

721
00:32:22.731 --> 00:32:25.040
<v Speaker 3>solution to figure out some biological</v>
<v Speaker 3>issue.</v>

722
00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:28.640
<v Speaker 3>A lot of that is science and obviously</v>
<v Speaker 3>science has been dominated by men for</v>

723
00:32:28.641 --> 00:32:31.310
<v Speaker 3>the longest time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The real questions are why.</v>

724
00:32:31.330 --> 00:32:31.960
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

725
00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:34.210
<v Speaker 3>And for sure there's been some sexism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

726
00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:36.920
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure there's been some oppressing</v>

727
00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:37.611
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

728
00:32:37.611 --> 00:32:38.550
<v Speaker 3>women's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

729
00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:40.490
<v Speaker 3>ideas</v>

730
00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:44.030
<v Speaker 1>and their ambitions and entering into</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain fields.</v>

731
00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:47.990
<v Speaker 1>And there's old boys clubs where they</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want women around because he can't</v>

732
00:32:47.991 --> 00:32:50.600
<v Speaker 1>talk about pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can talk about mustaches.</v>

733
00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:52.011
<v Speaker 1>Hitler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hitler,</v>

734
00:32:52.011 --> 00:32:52.844
<v Speaker 1>pussies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

735
00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:56.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a certain amount of</v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom that men enjoy when they were</v>

736
00:32:56.411 --> 00:33:00.530
<v Speaker 1>around only other men and that's in</v>
<v Speaker 1>place because they're the,</v>

737
00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:04.490
<v Speaker 1>they are the Alphas of society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so like the freedom that we desire</v>

738
00:33:04.491 --> 00:33:05.690
<v Speaker 1>as men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

00:33:43.191 --> 00:33:44.120
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neat.</v>

761
00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:45.153
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird.</v>

762
00:33:45.710 --> 00:33:48.920
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird thing like a admitting like</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to go</v>

763
00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:53.090
<v Speaker 1>because we know if you're a real</v>
<v Speaker 1>progressive,</v>

764
00:33:53.091 --> 00:33:54.590
<v Speaker 1>if you're real caring person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

765
00:33:54.591 --> 00:33:56.240
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're eating murdered animals.</v>

766
00:33:56.570 --> 00:33:58.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

767
00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:03.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that I am as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as ardent a meat eating supporter as you</v>

768
00:34:03.621 --> 00:34:05.960
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I also am not a.</v>

769
00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:08.330
<v Speaker 1>There is a moral imperative not to eat</v>
<v Speaker 1>meat,</v>

770
00:34:08.410 --> 00:34:08.820
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

771
00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:11.150
<v Speaker 1>I fall somewhere in the middle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is.</v>

772
00:34:11.330 --> 00:34:13.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think every thinking person falls in</v>

773
00:34:13.131 --> 00:34:16.350
<v Speaker 1>the middle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is meat probably isn't an</v>

774
00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:19.400
<v Speaker 1>obviously immoral thing to eat because</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want it.</v>

775
00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:20.540
<v Speaker 1>We are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are,</v>

776
00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:23.630
<v Speaker 1>we are animals and we want need and if</v>
<v Speaker 1>we didn't,</v>

777
00:34:23.660 --> 00:34:26.570
<v Speaker 1>why does a lie in the meat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we shouldn't.</v>

778
00:34:26.930 --> 00:34:28.220
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not a carnivore,</v>

779
00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:29.750
<v Speaker 1>but we are an Omnivore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

780
00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:31.190
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that,</v>

781
00:34:31.191 --> 00:34:32.540
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of people that say</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not.</v>

782
00:34:32.541 --> 00:34:33.560
<v Speaker 1>That's the big argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

783
00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:35.860
<v Speaker 1>I have this weird herbivores.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will.</v>

784
00:34:35.861 --> 00:34:37.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's odd to say the word divorce because</v>

785
00:34:37.521 --> 00:34:40.830
<v Speaker 1>we're not like Mcdonald's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mcdonald's,</v>

786
00:34:40.850 --> 00:34:41.720
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just that.</v>

787
00:34:41.721 --> 00:34:43.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that we can get away with eating it,</v>

788
00:34:43.431 --> 00:34:45.620
<v Speaker 1>but their faces designed for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

789
00:34:45.621 --> 00:34:46.160
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

790
00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:47.510
<v Speaker 1>For for a big block.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually.</v>

791
00:34:48.350 --> 00:34:49.280
<v Speaker 1>Perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually.</v>

792
00:34:49.281 --> 00:34:50.690
<v Speaker 1>Have you heard about the new big Mac?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

793
00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:52.760
<v Speaker 1>So there's a new hamburger at</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mcdonald's.</v>

794
00:34:52.761 --> 00:34:54.950
<v Speaker 1>It's a big Mac,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you don't want all that food,</v>

795
00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:57.380
<v Speaker 1>it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've taken out one button and one</v>

796
00:34:57.381 --> 00:34:58.720
<v Speaker 1>patty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's just a.</v>

797
00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:01.940
<v Speaker 1>it's a cheeseburger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're calling to the mack Jr.</v>

798
00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:05.990
<v Speaker 1>This is the kind of pernicious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Real demenTia is a fucking cheeseburger.</v>

799
00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:08.060
<v Speaker 1>So that's what they're calling it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so stupid.</v>

800
00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:09.170
<v Speaker 1>The mac.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>

801
00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:11.620
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come back to you and your solid one less</v>

802
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.600
<v Speaker 1>layer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it has the same amount of patties.</v>

803
00:35:14.601 --> 00:35:15.730
<v Speaker 1>Is that to patties?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

804
00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:17.690
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one less patty.</v>

805
00:35:17.691 --> 00:35:19.850
<v Speaker 1>One less button.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a fucking cheeseburger.</v>

806
00:35:19.851 --> 00:35:20.391
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

808
00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:22.490
<v Speaker 1>But it comes with our special sauce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

809
00:35:22.491 --> 00:35:25.580
<v Speaker 1>so it's a bad cheeseburger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to have a joke that actresses are</v>

810
00:35:25.581 --> 00:35:27.260
<v Speaker 1>like big macs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They never look as good as their</v>

811
00:35:27.261 --> 00:35:30.060
<v Speaker 1>pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

812
00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:32.090
<v Speaker 1>when's the last time you saw a big back</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that?</v>

813
00:35:32.091 --> 00:35:33.530
<v Speaker 1>Like god damn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that looks great.</v>

814
00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:35.060
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about the third big mac?</v>

815
00:35:35.061 --> 00:35:36.680
<v Speaker 1>The grand mac.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>what's in the grant?</v>

817
00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:40.560
<v Speaker 1>for those that didn't think the big mac</v>
<v Speaker 1>was big enough,</v>

818
00:35:41.130 --> 00:35:43.300
<v Speaker 1>it's a 100 percent beef patties ways.</v>

819
00:35:43.350 --> 00:35:45.750
<v Speaker 1>A third of a pound,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two slices,</v>

820
00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:49.230
<v Speaker 1>one that this is the problem with two</v>
<v Speaker 1>slices of melty,</v>

821
00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:51.120
<v Speaker 1>melty american cheese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

822
00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:51.661
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

823
00:35:51.661 --> 00:35:53.430
<v Speaker 1>it's not real cheese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we call it melty,</v>

824
00:35:53.431 --> 00:35:56.220
<v Speaker 1>melty american cheese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's melty american cheese is all one</v>

825
00:35:56.221 --> 00:35:57.900
<v Speaker 1>word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Melty american cheese.</v>

826
00:35:57.930 --> 00:36:01.450
<v Speaker 1>Stay woke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stay melty cheese at all.</v>

827
00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:03.960
<v Speaker 1>Those I eat melty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

828
00:36:04.110 --> 00:36:08.070
<v Speaker 1>this is the problem with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not you shooting an elk with a</v>

829
00:36:08.071 --> 00:36:10.320
<v Speaker 1>fucking bow and arrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's mcdonald's.</v>

830
00:36:10.321 --> 00:36:11.850
<v Speaker 1>Like having like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

831
00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:13.150
<v Speaker 1>couch weights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

832
00:36:13.530 --> 00:36:16.770
<v Speaker 1>stacked up and like they'Re eating their</v>
<v Speaker 1>own shit and we're all like just</v>

833
00:36:16.771 --> 00:36:20.310
<v Speaker 1>consuming it at the detriment of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>global world.</v>

834
00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:22.170
<v Speaker 1>Green greenhouse gases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

835
00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:27.470
<v Speaker 1>if only if everybody hunted to the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hunt then then there would be no</v>

836
00:36:27.601 --> 00:36:30.620
<v Speaker 1>moral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There'd be no moral question about elk.</v>

837
00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:33.090
<v Speaker 1>They would starve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't,</v>

838
00:36:33.210 --> 00:36:35.250
<v Speaker 1>we wouldn't make it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I will.</v>

839
00:36:35.250 --> 00:36:37.140
<v Speaker 1>We don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't even need meat.</v>

840
00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:38.520
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't need it.</v>

841
00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:42.900
<v Speaker 1>That's what I think the weird argument</v>
<v Speaker 1>about veganism from a moralistic</v>

842
00:36:42.901 --> 00:36:44.610
<v Speaker 1>perspective can be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you talk about it from an</v>

843
00:36:44.611 --> 00:36:46.290
<v Speaker 1>environmental perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>

844
00:36:46.291 --> 00:36:49.650
<v Speaker 1>very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always say like when you talk about,</v>

845
00:36:49.830 --> 00:36:51.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I want to say this on</v>
<v Speaker 1>your podcast,</v>

846
00:36:51.511 --> 00:36:54.820
<v Speaker 1>but when you talk to them about when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about environmental effects of</v>

847
00:36:54.821 --> 00:36:57.690
<v Speaker 1>neat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the same way that it feels the same</v>

848
00:36:57.691 --> 00:36:59.430
<v Speaker 1>as when you bring up the settlements in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Israel,</v>

849
00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:02.340
<v Speaker 1>you can have all these great</v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual discussions on well</v>

850
00:37:02.341 --> 00:37:03.330
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

851
00:37:03.331 --> 00:37:06.220
<v Speaker 1>and then you bring up the environmental</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you just go back.</v>

852
00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:07.500
<v Speaker 1>Can't defend that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>

853
00:37:07.610 --> 00:37:09.810
<v Speaker 1>there's no defense there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel the Same way with the settlements</v>

854
00:37:09.811 --> 00:37:12.360
<v Speaker 1>in Israel is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can make an impassioned plea for</v>

855
00:37:12.361 --> 00:37:13.860
<v Speaker 1>Israel and then when you bring up the</v>
<v Speaker 1>settlements,</v>

856
00:37:13.861 --> 00:37:14.401
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

857
00:37:14.401 --> 00:37:14.970
<v Speaker 1>I got nothing.</v>

858
00:37:14.970 --> 00:37:18.170
<v Speaker 1>Once you start bulldozing people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

859
00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:23.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure what tanks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we started this whole thing off with</v>

860
00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:28.050
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure out why women gravitate</v>
<v Speaker 1>towards certain things and whether or</v>

861
00:37:28.051 --> 00:37:30.300
<v Speaker 1>not there'd be suppressed and this is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>subject.</v>

862
00:37:30.301 --> 00:37:32.350
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like racism where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

863
00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:35.190
<v Speaker 1>if you're not a black person and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>start talking about black lives matter,</v>

864
00:37:35.191 --> 00:37:35.731
<v Speaker 1>people go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

865
00:37:35.731 --> 00:37:36.930
<v Speaker 1>fuck head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like whaT?</v>

866
00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:39.810
<v Speaker 1>What you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you either be ultra supportive or shut</v>

867
00:37:39.811 --> 00:37:42.660
<v Speaker 1>the fuck up now you get to be an ally</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

868
00:37:42.661 --> 00:37:43.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get out of the way.</v>

869
00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:45.930
<v Speaker 1>I hear that there is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

870
00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:47.610
<v Speaker 1>I hear that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's kind of representative I</v>

871
00:37:47.611 --> 00:37:50.850
<v Speaker 1>think of the way a lot of women feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the struggle is so pervasive and</v>

872
00:37:50.851 --> 00:37:53.370
<v Speaker 1>it's so much a part of their lives and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't get supported in it.</v>

873
00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:55.950
<v Speaker 1>And iT's so frustrating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially a woman that is trying to</v>

874
00:37:55.951 --> 00:37:56.910
<v Speaker 1>climb the corporate ladder.</v>

875
00:37:57.180 --> 00:37:59.280
<v Speaker 1>Like I have a good friend who's a big</v>
<v Speaker 1>tiMe executive.</v>

876
00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:04.110
<v Speaker 1>She was at google now setting up another</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of those big tech companies and</v>

877
00:38:04.111 --> 00:38:06.540
<v Speaker 1>she's a super,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super intelligent,</v>

878
00:38:06.541 --> 00:38:10.590
<v Speaker 1>super ambitious too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she's one of Those rare women that</v>

879
00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:12.780
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well her mom's like that too.</v>

880
00:38:12.781 --> 00:38:14.760
<v Speaker 1>So it's kind of interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting when you meet her mom</v>

881
00:38:14.761 --> 00:38:16.620
<v Speaker 1>who's this older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super sharp lady,</v>

882
00:38:17.010 --> 00:38:22.010
<v Speaker 1>but she's just always been like the type</v>
<v Speaker 1>of person that enjoys achieving.</v>

883
00:38:22.530 --> 00:38:24.540
<v Speaker 1>She'd like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is like her mindset.</v>

884
00:38:24.541 --> 00:38:27.450
<v Speaker 1>She enJoys it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She likes to achieving problem solving.</v>

885
00:38:27.451 --> 00:38:30.510
<v Speaker 1>She likes getting deals done and she's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>very nice person.</v>

886
00:38:30.570 --> 00:38:33.540
<v Speaker 1>It's not like she's some ruthless</v>
<v Speaker 1>monster who,</v>

887
00:38:33.541 --> 00:38:36.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does sit at forsaking all things for</v>

888
00:38:36.971 --> 00:38:38.820
<v Speaker 1>profit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

889
00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:40.750
<v Speaker 1>but there's not a lot of women like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

890
00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:42.430
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that many.</v>

891
00:38:42.431 --> 00:38:44.740
<v Speaker 1>So if you look at the great pool of</v>
<v Speaker 1>humans,</v>

892
00:38:45.130 --> 00:38:48.700
<v Speaker 1>like how muCh of it is them being held</v>
<v Speaker 1>back or how much of it is them being</v>

893
00:38:48.701 --> 00:38:50.330
<v Speaker 1>like really rare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like so.</v>

894
00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:54.460
<v Speaker 1>So few people like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you get 100 women in the room is one</v>

895
00:38:54.461 --> 00:38:55.480
<v Speaker 1>of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like my friend,</v>

896
00:38:55.481 --> 00:38:58.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the question always is why would</v>

897
00:38:58.121 --> 00:38:59.800
<v Speaker 1>there be so few women that are like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

898
00:38:59.801 --> 00:39:01.150
<v Speaker 1>There's no way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

899
00:39:01.151 --> 00:39:04.030
<v Speaker 1>it's all an intellectual exercise</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's no way that you could</v>

900
00:39:04.031 --> 00:39:08.620
<v Speaker 1>strip away all the thousands of years of</v>
<v Speaker 1>programming and systemic societal</v>

901
00:39:08.621 --> 00:39:10.480
<v Speaker 1>oppression to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

902
00:39:10.481 --> 00:39:11.740
<v Speaker 1>if we're on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always make.</v>

903
00:39:11.830 --> 00:39:14.980
<v Speaker 1>I always think about like if I took 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 kids,</v>

904
00:39:14.981 --> 00:39:19.300
<v Speaker 1>I used to think about this in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>gender dysphoria and trans transgender</v>

905
00:39:19.330 --> 00:39:22.780
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you were to take 50 kidS,</v>

906
00:39:23.110 --> 00:39:26.260
<v Speaker 1>50 boys and 50 girls and go put them on</v>
<v Speaker 1>a colony on the moon where they were</v>

907
00:39:26.261 --> 00:39:28.720
<v Speaker 1>raised by robots with no reference to</v>
<v Speaker 1>their gender.</v>

908
00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:33.100
<v Speaker 1>What things would you find that were</v>
<v Speaker 1>true about the women back home that were</v>

909
00:39:33.101 --> 00:39:34.300
<v Speaker 1>true of the women up there?</v>

910
00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:36.730
<v Speaker 1>Like if you could somehow strip away</v>
<v Speaker 1>society altogether,</v>

911
00:39:36.850 --> 00:39:39.340
<v Speaker 1>then what would be leftover?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What truly is male?</v>

912
00:39:39.341 --> 00:39:42.460
<v Speaker 1>What truly is female?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think there's actually a,</v>

913
00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:45.850
<v Speaker 1>there is an intersection between meat</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating and feminine and feminine and</v>

914
00:39:45.851 --> 00:39:49.570
<v Speaker 1>systemic feminism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really like human beings are</v>

915
00:39:49.690 --> 00:39:54.370
<v Speaker 1>this weird concoction of like conscious</v>
<v Speaker 1>aware,</v>

916
00:39:54.430 --> 00:39:59.080
<v Speaker 1>awake woke boys and girls and little</v>
<v Speaker 1>primate,</v>

917
00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:00.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kill the alpha.</v>

918
00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:02.440
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck the woman.</v>

919
00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:06.130
<v Speaker 1>My monkeys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so we're trying to grapple with that</v>

920
00:40:06.131 --> 00:40:11.131
<v Speaker 1>constantly like is it in inherent in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>notion that you should morally not eat</v>

921
00:40:11.261 --> 00:40:14.380
<v Speaker 1>meat is the idea that you are morally</v>
<v Speaker 1>superior to an animal that can't discern</v>

922
00:40:14.381 --> 00:40:18.130
<v Speaker 1>between the moral correctness of eating</v>
<v Speaker 1>meat and you know what I'm saying?</v>

923
00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:20.710
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're just an animal and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like any dog will eat anything you</v>

924
00:40:20.711 --> 00:40:22.690
<v Speaker 1>put in front of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's also,</v>

925
00:40:23.170 --> 00:40:25.030
<v Speaker 1>there's an Intellectual argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

926
00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:29.170
<v Speaker 1>Like if you leave these animals loan to</v>
<v Speaker 1>their own devices,</v>

927
00:40:29.171 --> 00:40:31.000
<v Speaker 1>what do they do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

928
00:40:31.001 --> 00:40:32.900
<v Speaker 1>they slaughter each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's what.</v>

929
00:40:32.950 --> 00:40:34.600
<v Speaker 1>That's what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what it is,</v>

930
00:40:34.601 --> 00:40:37.570
<v Speaker 1>is a bunch of stuff that grows and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of dumb stuff that eats</v>

931
00:40:37.571 --> 00:40:40.900
<v Speaker 1>the stuff that grows and then as much</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff that eats the dumb stuff and</v>

932
00:40:40.901 --> 00:40:43.030
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's nature and that really is the</v>

933
00:40:43.031 --> 00:40:46.820
<v Speaker 1>whole stuff that eats other mean stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>is mean stuff that he's bigger mean</v>

934
00:40:46.821 --> 00:40:51.821
<v Speaker 1>stuff and smaller mean stuff and then if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you step in and you take some of those</v>

935
00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:58.630
<v Speaker 1>dumb things that are eating the grass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can feel better [inaudible] healthy.</v>

936
00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:01.240
<v Speaker 1>Your body performs better and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a fact.</v>

937
00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:03.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people that want to say</v>

938
00:41:03.730 --> 00:41:06.520
<v Speaker 1>that meaning is bad for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is absolutely not.</v>

939
00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:08.250
<v Speaker 1>It's just not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's bad for you.</v>

940
00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:10.120
<v Speaker 1>Sedentary lifestyle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's bad for you,</v>

941
00:41:10.121 --> 00:41:14.710
<v Speaker 1>his sugar was bad for you is simple</v>
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrates and high quantities.</v>

942
00:41:14.890 --> 00:41:17.760
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of things that are bad for</v>
<v Speaker 1>your processed foods are bad for your</v>

943
00:41:17.761 --> 00:41:20.290
<v Speaker 1>preservatives are very bad for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of things,</v>

944
00:41:20.291 --> 00:41:22.240
<v Speaker 1>carcinogens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those things are bad for you,</v>

945
00:41:22.510 --> 00:41:25.720
<v Speaker 1>but just meat is protein and water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's really what it is,</v>

946
00:41:25.721 --> 00:41:28.960
<v Speaker 1>is a bunch of amino acids and there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of vitamins in it and as long as</v>

947
00:41:28.961 --> 00:41:32.950
<v Speaker 1>you're not eating too much of anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been proven that there's a lot of</v>

948
00:41:33.770 --> 00:41:34.130
<v Speaker 1>to eating</v>

949
00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:34.851
<v Speaker 3>meat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

950
00:41:34.851 --> 00:41:37.400
<v Speaker 3>be 12,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which really doesn't even exist in a</v>

951
00:41:37.401 --> 00:41:41.900
<v Speaker 3>vegan diet unless you're taking in weird</v>
<v Speaker 3>algaes and or bugs.</v>

952
00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:44.570
<v Speaker 3>Some people were willing to eat bugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bugs are the future,</v>

953
00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:46.400
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're all goiNg to be eating crickets,</v>

954
00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:49.190
<v Speaker 3>but it's a weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The distinctions of life,</v>

955
00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:52.670
<v Speaker 3>like we decide like for if you wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 3>eat something that's really simple and</v>

956
00:41:52.671 --> 00:41:53.750
<v Speaker 3>stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if your,</v>

957
00:41:53.751 --> 00:41:58.751
<v Speaker 3>if your issue is awareness or if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your issue is whether it's something</v>

958
00:41:59.061 --> 00:42:01.550
<v Speaker 3>sentient,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eat mollusks.</v>

959
00:42:01.830 --> 00:42:04.420
<v Speaker 3>There are some of the dumbest fuckIng</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing on the planet dumber.</v>

960
00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:07.070
<v Speaker 3>Even then plants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like plants communicate with each other.</v>

961
00:42:07.071 --> 00:42:10.610
<v Speaker 3>It's been proven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Michael pollan had some amazing work</v>

962
00:42:10.611 --> 00:42:13.310
<v Speaker 3>about it and not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have,</v>

963
00:42:14.210 --> 00:42:16.130
<v Speaker 3>not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's been proven that the communicate</v>

964
00:42:16.131 --> 00:42:17.760
<v Speaker 3>with each other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they also produce human</v>

965
00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:20.180
<v Speaker 3>neurotransmitters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They produce like serotonin,</v>

966
00:42:20.450 --> 00:42:23.060
<v Speaker 3>like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some arguments that they,</v>

967
00:42:23.061 --> 00:42:25.580
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they actually allocate resources to</v>

968
00:42:25.581 --> 00:42:28.730
<v Speaker 3>support other plants in the community</v>
<v Speaker 3>and talking about those like root</v>

969
00:42:28.731 --> 00:42:29.660
<v Speaker 3>systems or whatever.</v>

970
00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:31.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have a micrOrisal relationship with</v>

971
00:42:31.671 --> 00:42:34.250
<v Speaker 3>different funguses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some trees where if you go into it,</v>

972
00:42:34.251 --> 00:42:35.930
<v Speaker 3>there's a group of elves make them</v>
<v Speaker 3>cookies.</v>

973
00:42:36.530 --> 00:42:37.363
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

974
00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:40.880
<v Speaker 3>that's responsible for a lot of forest</v>
<v Speaker 3>fires.</v>

975
00:42:41.290 --> 00:42:44.690
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>All those killing cookie up man.</v>

976
00:42:45.050 --> 00:42:46.880
<v Speaker 3>But one of those elves actually made it</v>
<v Speaker 3>really far.</v>

977
00:42:46.881 --> 00:42:49.190
<v Speaker 3>He's actually the attorney general of</v>
<v Speaker 3>our country.</v>

978
00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:51.380
<v Speaker 3>What's happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>jeff sessIons and now he was an</v>

979
00:42:51.410 --> 00:42:52.770
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

980
00:42:53.660 --> 00:42:54.820
<v Speaker 3>one was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was,</v>

981
00:42:54.850 --> 00:42:59.850
<v Speaker 3>he was like a top or doping,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the um,</v>

982
00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:03.770
<v Speaker 3>I think plants talk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's interesting.</v>

983
00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:05.990
<v Speaker 3>I think they communicate with each other</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a way that we don't understand.</v>

984
00:43:05.991 --> 00:43:07.790
<v Speaker 3>And this is one of the reasons I read,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think this,</v>

985
00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.900
<v Speaker 3>they've done these studies where they</v>
<v Speaker 3>played the sound of caterpillars,</v>

986
00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:17.080
<v Speaker 3>played the sound of caterpillars</v>
<v Speaker 3>munching on leaves next to an acacia</v>

987
00:43:17.571 --> 00:43:20.930
<v Speaker 3>tree and it changed the way the tree</v>
<v Speaker 3>tastes.</v>

988
00:43:21.530 --> 00:43:23.090
<v Speaker 3>Like when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you,</v>

989
00:43:23.210 --> 00:43:26.050
<v Speaker 3>there's certain trees that when they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

990
00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:28.250
<v Speaker 3>when an animal's chewing them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the acacia bushes,</v>

991
00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:31.880
<v Speaker 3>a famous one when an animal's chewing</v>
<v Speaker 3>them up wind.</v>

992
00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:34.880
<v Speaker 3>So like something's chewing it and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>sent comes down wind to them,</v>

993
00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:40.120
<v Speaker 3>they changed their flavor profile and</v>
<v Speaker 3>become a toxic tasting so that animals</v>

994
00:43:40.281 --> 00:43:42.890
<v Speaker 3>will actually starve to death rather</v>
<v Speaker 3>than eat them.</v>

995
00:43:43.310 --> 00:43:45.560
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they changed so that the caterpillar</v>

996
00:43:45.561 --> 00:43:47.660
<v Speaker 3>won't eat them to discourage predation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow,</v>

997
00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:50.360
<v Speaker 3>thAt's wild.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They do it based on sound,</v>

998
00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:54.200
<v Speaker 3>like they'll do it based on the smell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also sound plants respond</v>

999
00:43:54.201 --> 00:43:56.060
<v Speaker 3>defensively.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The sound of caterpillars eating their</v>

1000
00:43:56.061 --> 00:43:57.500
<v Speaker 3>leaves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they produce these,</v>

1001
00:43:57.620 --> 00:43:59.010
<v Speaker 3>these poisons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they,</v>

1002
00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:01.400
<v Speaker 3>they taste like shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but so that no one eats them and it</v>

1003
00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:04.010
<v Speaker 3>literally will cause they figured this</v>
<v Speaker 3>out from giraffes,</v>

1004
00:44:04.330 --> 00:44:06.860
<v Speaker 3>but that's not evidence of sanctions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1005
00:44:06.861 --> 00:44:09.510
<v Speaker 3>it's evidence of some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>communication because one,</v>

1006
00:44:09.570 --> 00:44:13.310
<v Speaker 3>one plant way up there is communicating</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the other plants that are nowhere</v>

1007
00:44:13.311 --> 00:44:13.550
<v Speaker 3>near.</v>

1008
00:44:13.550 --> 00:44:14.720
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So okay.</v>

1009
00:44:14.721 --> 00:44:18.860
<v Speaker 3>So all of the trees and the network will</v>
<v Speaker 3>start tasting like shit just starts.</v>

1010
00:44:18.861 --> 00:44:20.750
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some sort of a network.</v>

1011
00:44:20.980 --> 00:44:22.340
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the michael pollan Book,</v>

1012
00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:25.040
<v Speaker 3>I forget which book it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where he goes into depth about this,</v>

1013
00:44:25.490 --> 00:44:28.340
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's quite a few different,</v>

1014
00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:31.200
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>scientific papers that have been done on</v>

1015
00:44:31.201 --> 00:44:36.201
<v Speaker 3>plant intelligent intelligence and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>a fairly new and emerging field and it's</v>

1016
00:44:36.691 --> 00:44:40.710
<v Speaker 3>very disturbing field people that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>vegan because they like to pretend that,</v>

1017
00:44:40.711 --> 00:44:41.510
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well we have,</v>

1018
00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:44.640
<v Speaker 3>what we're doing is causing no harm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not true.</v>

1019
00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:46.320
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone causes harm.</v>

1020
00:44:46.350 --> 00:44:49.230
<v Speaker 3>Life eats life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the weird things that people</v>

1021
00:44:49.231 --> 00:44:51.090
<v Speaker 3>do where they have no problem eating</v>
<v Speaker 3>with their vegan.</v>

1022
00:44:51.091 --> 00:44:52.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm just gonna eat vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1023
00:44:52.531 --> 00:44:56.430
<v Speaker 3>large scale agriculture is one of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>most devastating things that can happen</v>

1024
00:44:56.431 --> 00:44:59.070
<v Speaker 3>to the ground that those plants are</v>
<v Speaker 3>planted on you.</v>

1025
00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:02.550
<v Speaker 3>You complete,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you see a field and it's like a</v>

1026
00:45:02.550 --> 00:45:05.310
<v Speaker 3>thousand acres of corn that is so not</v>
<v Speaker 3>normal.</v>

1027
00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:10.020
<v Speaker 3>I mean that is just sO weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And even if it's totally organic,</v>

1028
00:45:10.270 --> 00:45:11.103
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you're,</v>

1029
00:45:11.110 --> 00:45:14.340
<v Speaker 3>you're displacing all this wildlife to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do that.</v>

1030
00:45:14.341 --> 00:45:16.420
<v Speaker 3>You're changing that environment</v>
<v Speaker 3>entirely.</v>

1031
00:45:16.430 --> 00:45:17.820
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're stripping nutrients from the</v>

1032
00:45:17.821 --> 00:45:20.850
<v Speaker 3>soil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>are we like running toward a cliff?</v>

1033
00:45:21.010 --> 00:45:23.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the way to put the nutrients back is</v>

1034
00:45:23.071 --> 00:45:26.400
<v Speaker 3>you're dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Things used fish are dead animals and</v>

1035
00:45:26.401 --> 00:45:28.770
<v Speaker 3>that's how they get the nutrients back</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the store.</v>

1036
00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:30.920
<v Speaker 3>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was an interesting article article</v>

1037
00:45:30.930 --> 00:45:31.763
<v Speaker 3>that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1038
00:45:32.070 --> 00:45:36.980
<v Speaker 3>I tweeted a about a year back that</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody got so mad that it's actually</v>

1039
00:45:36.990 --> 00:45:40.200
<v Speaker 3>impossible to be a vegetarian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And thIs is by someone who is a vegan</v>

1040
00:45:40.590 --> 00:45:41.480
<v Speaker 3>saying this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What did they,</v>

1041
00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:41.910
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

1042
00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:44.850
<v Speaker 3>what are they saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not adjusting every animal,</v>

1043
00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:50.300
<v Speaker 3>every plant like devours living things</v>
<v Speaker 3>in order to stay alive and your</v>

1044
00:45:50.430 --> 00:45:54.570
<v Speaker 3>devouring the nutrients from those</v>
<v Speaker 3>living things like by eating these</v>

1045
00:45:54.571 --> 00:45:56.340
<v Speaker 3>plants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're eating something.</v>

1046
00:45:56.350 --> 00:45:58.130
<v Speaker 3>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's actually impossible to be a</v>

1047
00:45:58.140 --> 00:46:03.140
<v Speaker 3>vegetarians fascinating read because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's written by a vegan and it's.</v>

1048
00:46:03.501 --> 00:46:05.190
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a weird argument,</v>

1049
00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:06.930
<v Speaker 3>but you realize,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1050
00:46:06.931 --> 00:46:09.300
<v Speaker 3>there's this connection that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>inexorable.</v>

1051
00:46:09.330 --> 00:46:11.790
<v Speaker 3>Like it's not like these plants just</v>
<v Speaker 3>live only on water</v>

1052
00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:12.990
<v Speaker 2>but isn't the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1053
00:46:13.010 --> 00:46:17.120
<v Speaker 2>here's the idea that brings us back to</v>
<v Speaker 2>this feminism idea and what structure on</v>

1054
00:46:17.130 --> 00:46:20.180
<v Speaker 2>what is and isn't the idea that if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>

1055
00:46:20.210 --> 00:46:22.910
<v Speaker 2>If you believe that humanity has a</v>
<v Speaker 2>moral,</v>

1056
00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:27.500
<v Speaker 2>it's encumbered upon humanity to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>morally forthright in a more,</v>

1057
00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:30.470
<v Speaker 2>to be more than an animal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you have to reckon with what's the</v>

1058
00:46:30.471 --> 00:46:32.060
<v Speaker 2>way that I can do the least harm in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

1059
00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:34.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying I do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying that is,</v>

1060
00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:38.120
<v Speaker 2>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the moral and intellectual idea</v>

1061
00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:40.790
<v Speaker 2>of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know how to deal with systemic</v>

1062
00:46:40.970 --> 00:46:44.420
<v Speaker 2>oppression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to deal with a low impact diet.</v>

1063
00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:49.720
<v Speaker 2>Like I think like there's no question</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you hunting elk is in the framework</v>

1064
00:46:49.791 --> 00:46:52.160
<v Speaker 2>of if I'm god in the acceptibility</v>
<v Speaker 2>range,</v>

1065
00:46:52.310 --> 00:46:53.060
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible],</v>

1066
00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:58.060
<v Speaker 2>but then factory farMing And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>worst Case scenario and worst case</v>

1067
00:46:58.431 --> 00:47:00.680
<v Speaker 2>scenario is this is the scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1068
00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:06.240
<v Speaker 3>I Think what also would happen is these</v>
<v Speaker 3>societies that we enjoy these</v>

1069
00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:08.680
<v Speaker 3>civilizations like New York city,</v>
<v Speaker 3>la,</v>

1070
00:47:09.010 --> 00:47:14.010
<v Speaker 3>they got too big before we engineered</v>
<v Speaker 3>them before rather we engineered like</v>

1071
00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:19.820
<v Speaker 3>I'm an engineer is the wrong word before</v>
<v Speaker 3>we really managed the resources that you</v>

1072
00:47:20.891 --> 00:47:25.891
<v Speaker 3>need to allocate to in order to feed 20,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have 25 million people in the greater</v>

1073
00:47:26.441 --> 00:47:28.210
<v Speaker 3>los angeles area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's about all that shit.</v>

1074
00:47:28.510 --> 00:47:29.343
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot of,</v>

1075
00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:30.040
<v Speaker 3>it's so</v>

1076
00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:31.540
<v Speaker 2>much shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you do with the shit?</v>

1077
00:47:31.541 --> 00:47:33.910
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever have a story of the ocean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You ever hear the story about New York</v>

1078
00:47:33.911 --> 00:47:35.230
<v Speaker 2>city's shit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1079
00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:36.580
<v Speaker 2>Where's it go?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty fascinating.</v>

1080
00:47:36.730 --> 00:47:38.380
<v Speaker 2>So they basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1081
00:47:38.430 --> 00:47:40.060
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it all goes in the same place.</v>

1082
00:47:40.061 --> 00:47:41.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it all goes to plants,</v>

1083
00:47:41.111 --> 00:47:43.050
<v Speaker 2>which is a treatment plan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

1084
00:47:43.051 --> 00:47:45.130
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not plants that feel and make themselves</v>

1085
00:47:45.131 --> 00:47:46.520
<v Speaker 2>tastes bitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but treatment plans.</v>

1086
00:47:46.650 --> 00:47:47.680
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So every,</v>

1087
00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:49.830
<v Speaker 2>every shitty like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1088
00:47:49.850 --> 00:47:53.290
<v Speaker 2>lower eastside hipster and chinatown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chinese person and like upper east side,</v>

1089
00:47:53.291 --> 00:47:54.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do it all.</v>

1090
00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:57.850
<v Speaker 2>There's little squiggly shits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll go into electric plants where they</v>

1091
00:47:57.851 --> 00:48:01.780
<v Speaker 2>treat it and then their leftover with</v>
<v Speaker 2>this pile of fucking big old New York</v>

1092
00:48:01.781 --> 00:48:02.830
<v Speaker 2>city shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>

1093
00:48:02.831 --> 00:48:06.640
<v Speaker 2>what do we do with the shit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't have a farm lands nearby.</v>

1094
00:48:06.641 --> 00:48:09.290
<v Speaker 2>And so they basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because a lot of it goes to fertilizer,</v>

1095
00:48:09.291 --> 00:48:11.080
<v Speaker 2>so they started trying to take it out on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1096
00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:13.900
<v Speaker 2>on the free market you can sell shit on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the free market.</v>

1097
00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:17.710
<v Speaker 2>Oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that real?</v>

1098
00:48:17.711 --> 00:48:18.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You sell it to farms.</v>

1099
00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:24.030
<v Speaker 2>And the funny part is that all these</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Kansas and Indiana and like real</v>

1100
00:48:24.430 --> 00:48:26.830

<v Speaker 2>we're good.</v>

1102
00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:33.660
<v Speaker 2>We don't want that big city city slicker</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit to our community.</v>

1103
00:48:35.590 --> 00:48:39.070
<v Speaker 2>Oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically the stigma of New York,</v>

1104
00:48:39.071 --> 00:48:42.160
<v Speaker 2>yankee ness was too big for them to</v>
<v Speaker 2>accept the shit.</v>

1105
00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:44.110
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not even for free.</v>

1106
00:48:44.350 --> 00:48:45.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They wouldn't take the,</v>

1107
00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:47.200
<v Speaker 2>take it for free and if they buy cow</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>

1108
00:48:47.230 --> 00:48:50.950
<v Speaker 2>but isn't cow shit way better because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all grass will cow shit.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's better.</v>

1110
00:48:52.931 --> 00:48:54.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a shit expert.</v>

1111
00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:56.090
<v Speaker 2>I just dabble in shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1112
00:48:56.260 --> 00:48:58.060
<v Speaker 2>I dabble in shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1113
00:48:58.061 --> 00:49:01.750
<v Speaker 2>so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I smelled like it and I think</v>

1114
00:49:01.751 --> 00:49:03.590
<v Speaker 2>about it a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But other than that I talk a lot of it.</v>

1115
00:49:04.510 --> 00:49:07.650
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1116
00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:10.660
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you think about like how much shit</v>

1117
00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:15.550
<v Speaker 2>it has to go somewhere and all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>garbage when you order stuff.</v>

1118
00:49:16.060 --> 00:49:18.070
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was getting ready for uh,</v>

1119
00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:23.280
<v Speaker 2>for burning man this year and I went to</v>
<v Speaker 2>target to buy pillows and I bought</v>

1120
00:49:23.321 --> 00:49:26.740
<v Speaker 2>pillows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brand new pillows for $4 and I was just</v>

1121
00:49:26.741 --> 00:49:27.521
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is great.</v>

1122
00:49:27.521 --> 00:49:30.210
<v Speaker 2>And tossed the pillow fresh pillows and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then uh,</v>

1123
00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:34.570
<v Speaker 2>my wife was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that there are $4 pillows is</v>

1124
00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:39.070
<v Speaker 2>systemically connected to societies</v>
<v Speaker 2>collapse on some level.</v>

1125
00:49:39.071 --> 00:49:44.071
<v Speaker 2>Like there's no way to make a $4 pillow</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not have the earth like suffering at</v>

1126
00:49:44.201 --> 00:49:47.500
<v Speaker 2>some point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just how do you do that and all the</v>

1127
00:49:47.501 --> 00:49:50.590
<v Speaker 2>garbage and I can go to burning man and</v>
<v Speaker 2>sleep on it for a week and be like,</v>

1128
00:49:50.591 --> 00:49:52.690
<v Speaker 2>this is dusty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Toss it into a landfill.</v>

1129
00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:56.200
<v Speaker 2>Where is this stuff going?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't the argument that target pLaces</v>

1130
00:49:56.201 --> 00:49:58.570
<v Speaker 2>like tarGet and walmart especially are</v>
<v Speaker 2>subsidized?</v>

1131
00:49:59.140 --> 00:50:00.040
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

1132
00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:01.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they definitely are,</v>

1133
00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:03.940
<v Speaker 2>but in one way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shape or form,</v>

1134
00:50:03.941 --> 00:50:06.970
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>To welfare or through food stamps or</v>

1135
00:50:06.971 --> 00:50:09.130
<v Speaker 2>through actually not welfare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1136
00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:13.030
<v Speaker 2>They have to certain wage to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You mean to.</v>

1137
00:50:13.250 --> 00:50:16.970

<v Speaker 2>In order to support like w how much you</v>

1138
00:50:16.971 --> 00:50:19.320
<v Speaker 2>have to qualify for welfare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1139
00:50:19.870 --> 00:50:21.910
<v Speaker 2>I think you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I grew up on welfare.</v>

1140
00:50:21.911 --> 00:50:25.210
<v Speaker 2>Actually need to know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you really do you like that about</v>

1141
00:50:25.211 --> 00:50:27.970
<v Speaker 2>yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find a great of pride in this.</v>

1142
00:50:27.990 --> 00:50:29.210
<v Speaker 1>Said it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just blurted it out.</v>

1143
00:50:29.211 --> 00:50:29.811
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1146
00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:38.390
<v Speaker 1>than a person Who's never interacted</v>
<v Speaker 1>with real poor people.</v>

1147
00:50:38.391 --> 00:50:41.150
<v Speaker 1>Talking about the lazy people on</v>
<v Speaker 1>welfare.</v>

1149
00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:46.520

<v Speaker 1>although we were on welfare,</v>

1150
00:50:47.060 --> 00:50:50.660
<v Speaker 1>she worked too and got to a point where</v>
<v Speaker 1>she didn't have to be on welfare anymore</v>

1151
00:50:50.661 --> 00:50:52.100
<v Speaker 1>and then she got off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same with me.</v>

1152
00:50:52.700 --> 00:50:54.320
<v Speaker 1>So it made me realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1153
00:50:54.620 --> 00:50:56.450
<v Speaker 1>like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this actually can work,</v>

1154
00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:57.470
<v Speaker 1>can help,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same here,</v>

1155
00:50:57.500 --> 00:50:59.180
<v Speaker 1>that are super poor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had food stamps,</v>

1156
00:50:59.181 --> 00:51:01.040
<v Speaker 1>the whole deal and my thing has always</v>
<v Speaker 1>been,</v>

1157
00:51:01.041 --> 00:51:02.120
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to welfare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1158
00:51:02.121 --> 00:51:07.121
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't you rather allow a person to</v>
<v Speaker 1>take advantage of the system so that</v>

1159
00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:09.620
<v Speaker 1>some percentage of those people can</v>
<v Speaker 1>write,</v>

1160
00:51:09.830 --> 00:51:12.280
<v Speaker 1>can raise through the ranks and get off</v>
<v Speaker 1>of welfare and,</v>

1161
00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:13.910
<v Speaker 1>and better themselves and better their</v>
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>

1162
00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:16.280
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't you rather have that system in</v>
<v Speaker 1>place?</v>

1163
00:51:16.281 --> 00:51:17.690
<v Speaker 1>Then the system that says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

1164
00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:20.660
<v Speaker 1>we're worried about people taking</v>
<v Speaker 1>advantage of the systeM so everybody</v>

1165
00:51:20.661 --> 00:51:22.760
<v Speaker 1>including the good people can go fuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

1166
00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:25.090
<v Speaker 1>Which society do you want to live in?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1167
00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:27.260
<v Speaker 1>There's certainly the former.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1168
00:51:27.261 --> 00:51:28.470
<v Speaker 1>I think with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1169
00:51:28.850 --> 00:51:31.880
<v Speaker 1>with my mom's situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was also important to send the</v>

1170
00:51:31.881 --> 00:51:35.870
<v Speaker 1>messaGe that it gives a woman an option</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get away from an abusive man.</v>

1171
00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:37.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My mom left,</v>

1172
00:51:37.611 --> 00:51:41.690
<v Speaker 1>my dad and My stepdad didn't have any</v>
<v Speaker 1>money and they weren't married at the</v>

1173
00:51:41.691 --> 00:51:43.100
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were boyfriend and girlfriend and</v>

1174
00:51:43.101 --> 00:51:45.100
<v Speaker 1>he was a student and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1175
00:51:45.150 --> 00:51:46.880
<v Speaker 1>we got on welfare and we ate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1176
00:51:46.990 --> 00:51:48.650
<v Speaker 1>we drink powdered milk and the whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>deal,</v>

1177
00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:51.280
<v Speaker 1>but it's very similar situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very similar.</v>

1178
00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:53.840
<v Speaker 1>My mom left my dad when I was one and</v>
<v Speaker 1>came out here.</v>

1179
00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:57.260
<v Speaker 1>She's a disabled wOman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like everything was stacked against</v>

1180
00:51:57.261 --> 00:51:58.970
<v Speaker 1>her and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1181
00:51:59.420 --> 00:52:02.720
<v Speaker 1>so we were raised on food stamps and</v>
<v Speaker 1>welfare jews on welfare.</v>

1182
00:52:02.721 --> 00:52:04.060
<v Speaker 1>Very rare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very rare.</v>

1183
00:52:04.150 --> 00:52:04.983
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1184
00:52:05.230 --> 00:52:05.801
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1185
00:52:05.801 --> 00:52:09.530
<v Speaker 1>it definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have a society that's a caring</v>

1186
00:52:09.531 --> 00:52:10.970
<v Speaker 1>society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1187
00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:14.150
<v Speaker 1>it certainly serves its function.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What people are worried about is the</v>

1188
00:52:14.151 --> 00:52:16.460
<v Speaker 1>same thing you're worried about when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're talking about free housing.</v>

1189
00:52:16.850 --> 00:52:18.860
<v Speaker 1>I was just gonna say we can bring it all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way back.</v>

1190
00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:20.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're worried about people that come</v>

1191
00:52:20.721 --> 00:52:22.820
<v Speaker 1>along that juke the system that don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to work,</v>

1192
00:52:22.821 --> 00:52:24.140
<v Speaker 1>that are lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>who cares?</v>

1193
00:52:24.330 --> 00:52:25.101
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let them.</v>

1194
00:52:25.101 --> 00:52:26.300
<v Speaker 1>Duke wouldn't you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1195
00:52:26.330 --> 00:52:28.670
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would rather help people that need the</v>

1196
00:52:28.671 --> 00:52:33.671
<v Speaker 1>help and allow someone to juke the</v>
<v Speaker 1>system than I would live in a stark</v>

1197
00:52:33.771 --> 00:52:36.380
<v Speaker 1>society that says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry we don't help people here</v>

1198
00:52:36.381 --> 00:52:39.680
<v Speaker 1>because we're worried that somebody</v>
<v Speaker 1>might steal 100 percent and you know,</v>

1199
00:52:39.681 --> 00:52:43.760
<v Speaker 1>there's a real issue that's coming up</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now with artificial intelligence</v>

1200
00:52:43.761 --> 00:52:47.780
<v Speaker 1>and automation that's gonna remove</v>
<v Speaker 1>millions and millions of jobs just by</v>

1201
00:52:47.781 --> 00:52:49.550
<v Speaker 1>virtue of automated cars are done.</v>

1202
00:52:49.730 --> 00:52:53.690
<v Speaker 1>And so people were talking very</v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously about universal basic income</v>

1203
00:52:53.790 --> 00:52:56.780
<v Speaker 1>is either inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are two inevitabilities,</v>

1204
00:52:56.990 --> 00:53:01.310
<v Speaker 1>either universal basic income will come</v>
<v Speaker 1>and take the place of the income that</v>

1205
00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:03.920
<v Speaker 1>was stripped away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not because anybody did anything wrong,</v>

1206
00:53:03.921 --> 00:53:08.921
<v Speaker 1>but because they did everything right</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the eventual automated reality is</v>

1207
00:53:08.931 --> 00:53:12.020
<v Speaker 1>that there aren't jobs from people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's job for you and me,</v>

1208
00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:15.920
<v Speaker 1>but there's not a job for a skilled</v>
<v Speaker 1>journeymen worker because there's a</v>

1209
00:53:15.921 --> 00:53:18.260
<v Speaker 1>fucking machine that can work 24 hours a</v>
<v Speaker 1>truck driver.</v>

1210
00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:20.540
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A truck drivers are there first.</v>

1211
00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:23.300
<v Speaker 1>They're the shock troops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why this whole thing with trump</v>

1212
00:53:23.301 --> 00:53:24.560
<v Speaker 1>saving coal jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1213
00:53:24.740 --> 00:53:26.190
<v Speaker 1>I hate to say it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like coal jobs</v>

1214
00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:27.220
<v Speaker 5>don't matter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1215
00:53:27.590 --> 00:53:29.410
<v Speaker 5>and in the long,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I know it's like,</v>

1216
00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:33.420
<v Speaker 5>it's like this hollywood,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like comedian juggler look cool jobs</v>

1217
00:53:33.421 --> 00:53:35.880
<v Speaker 5>don't matter and I know if you're a coal</v>
<v Speaker 5>miner listening to this,</v>

1218
00:53:36.210 --> 00:53:38.250
<v Speaker 5>the coal job matters to you more than</v>
<v Speaker 5>anything else,</v>

1219
00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:39.840
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know how Few coal jobs are.</v>

1220
00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:41.220
<v Speaker 5>It's very few,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very few.</v>

1221
00:53:41.250 --> 00:53:46.250
<v Speaker 5>There's like $75,000 overall coal jobs</v>
<v Speaker 5>and there's some insane like new energy,</v>

1222
00:53:46.471 --> 00:53:49.380
<v Speaker 5>like there's a half a million new energy</v>
<v Speaker 5>jobs just in California alone.</v>

1223
00:53:49.410 --> 00:53:50.540
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1224
00:53:50.910 --> 00:53:52.710
<v Speaker 5>And so everybody kind of made those</v>
<v Speaker 5>numbers up,</v>

1225
00:53:53.190 --> 00:53:58.050
<v Speaker 5>but it's big and everybody paid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody focuses on the human being.</v>

1226
00:53:58.051 --> 00:53:59.430
<v Speaker 5>Does every,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they focus on the,</v>

1227
00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:01.530
<v Speaker 5>on the day to day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they focus on the sun going up and down.</v>

1228
00:54:01.531 --> 00:54:03.510
<v Speaker 5>They don't focus on the year going by,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1229
00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:05.010
<v Speaker 5>It's like you go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1230
00:54:05.011 --> 00:54:07.230
<v Speaker 5>but my job is gone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want my job back.</v>

1231
00:54:07.260 --> 00:54:09.380
<v Speaker 5>But it's like your job doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1232
00:54:09.690 --> 00:54:11.700
<v Speaker 5>entire coal industry employs fewer</v>
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

1233
00:54:11.701 --> 00:54:14.550
<v Speaker 5>That arby's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>holy shit.</v>

1234
00:54:14.580 --> 00:54:16.350
<v Speaker 5>Imagine if he was talking about arby's</v>
<v Speaker 5>though,</v>

1235
00:54:16.530 --> 00:54:21.210
<v Speaker 5>but I think what he's doing is sort of</v>
<v Speaker 5>like this giant pro business push</v>

1236
00:54:21.211 --> 00:54:22.770
<v Speaker 5>transparent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so transparent.</v>

1237
00:54:22.820 --> 00:54:24.090
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's obvious.</v>

1238
00:54:24.091 --> 00:54:28.260
<v Speaker 5>It's just about Making a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 5>that he knows money and allowing a bunch</v>

1239
00:54:28.261 --> 00:54:32.790
<v Speaker 5>of people that have lost money that have</v>
<v Speaker 5>probably in some way or shape or form</v>

1240
00:54:32.791 --> 00:54:34.380
<v Speaker 5>contributed to him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1241
00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:36.840
<v Speaker 5>And also he's not an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it might be,</v>

1242
00:54:37.020 --> 00:54:41.180
<v Speaker 5>but he also won the election by about</v>
<v Speaker 5>the amount of people that work for me.</v>

1243
00:54:41.230 --> 00:54:44.550
<v Speaker 5>It's</v>
<v Speaker 5>definitely not an idiot.</v>

1244
00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:49.470
<v Speaker 5>She's probably got some kind of high iq</v>
<v Speaker 5>that is overshadowed by a severe</v>

1245
00:54:49.471 --> 00:54:50.950
<v Speaker 5>personality disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1246
00:54:50.970 --> 00:54:53.190
<v Speaker 5>And what do you think that is?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like narcissistic.</v>

1247
00:54:53.220 --> 00:54:54.480
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just think he's.</v>

1248
00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:56.850
<v Speaker 5>There's something wrong with him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No doubt about that.</v>

1249
00:54:57.030 --> 00:54:58.390
<v Speaker 5>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's something wrong with them.</v>

1250
00:54:58.410 --> 00:55:01.470
<v Speaker 5>Don't you think that in order for</v>
<v Speaker 5>someone to put their name up on</v>

1251
00:55:01.590 --> 00:55:03.960
<v Speaker 5>everything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I was in New York this past weekend</v>

1252
00:55:04.170 --> 00:55:07.020
<v Speaker 5>and we drove by this like trump</v>
<v Speaker 5>research,</v>

1253
00:55:07.090 --> 00:55:11.770
<v Speaker 5>a rehabilitation center,</v>
<v Speaker 5>trump rehabilitation center.</v>

1254
00:55:12.310 --> 00:55:14.130
<v Speaker 5>It was like this real shitty old</v>
<v Speaker 5>building.</v>

1255
00:55:14.131 --> 00:55:15.120
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What they do is they put a,</v>

1256
00:55:15.121 --> 00:55:17.630
<v Speaker 5>they put a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a crack rock in front of you and it,</v>

1257
00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:18.900
<v Speaker 5>and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which one do you want to grab?</v>

1258
00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:25.560
<v Speaker 5>Just keep diverting you do the pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then further down the line it was</v>

1259
00:55:25.561 --> 00:55:29.580
<v Speaker 5>trump links were driving on this road</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it said trump links golf course.</v>

1260
00:55:29.590 --> 00:55:32.330
<v Speaker 5>So it was golf.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know about the trunks.</v>

1261
00:55:32.430 --> 00:55:34.500
<v Speaker 5>Trump steaks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>steaks.</v>

1262
00:55:34.530 --> 00:55:35.160
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1263
00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:37.140
<v Speaker 5>have you never seen this commercial?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's really funny.</v>

1264
00:55:37.260 --> 00:55:39.180
<v Speaker 5>The trumps state commercial is like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>the real issue with us,</v>

1271
00:55:52.630 --> 00:55:53.750

<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1272
00:55:53.790 --> 00:55:58.350
<v Speaker 5>animal attack videos because those get</v>
<v Speaker 5>so many hits that somebody owns them and</v>

1273
00:55:58.351 --> 00:56:00.710
<v Speaker 5>claims them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then you get pulled off of facebook.</v>

1313
00:58:17.741 --> 00:58:20.350
<v Speaker 5>talking about sticks in the exact same</v>
<v Speaker 5>way that he's talking about governmental</v>

1314
00:58:20.351 --> 00:58:21.250
<v Speaker 5>policy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>how the fuck,</v>

<v Speaker 5>world.</v>

1317
00:58:25.451 --> 00:58:26.210
<v Speaker 5>If there's no place,</v>

1318
00:58:26.210 --> 00:58:29.970
<v Speaker 2>I would rather get my meat and then the</v>
<v Speaker 2>sharper image I go to brookstone or</v>

1319
00:58:29.971 --> 00:58:30.710
<v Speaker 2>sharper image.</v>

1320
00:58:30.710 --> 00:58:32.960
<v Speaker 5>That's my butcher donnelly that whoever</v>
<v Speaker 5>wrote that,</v>

1321
00:58:32.970 --> 00:58:37.970
<v Speaker 5>like that's in need of a second draft,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so is a terrible why it's so good.</v>

1322
00:58:39.100 --> 00:58:41.210
<v Speaker 5>I would eat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would push back and say,</v>

1323
00:58:41.211 --> 00:58:43.550
<v Speaker 5>donald trump's not a big second draft</v>
<v Speaker 5>guy.</v>

1324
00:58:43.910 --> 00:58:45.090
<v Speaker 5>He's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1325
00:58:45.170 --> 00:58:48.200
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to say I'm really good and</v>
<v Speaker 5>know a lot about it and let's do this.</v>

1326
00:58:48.230 --> 00:58:50.720
<v Speaker 5>He's right up there with l ron hubbard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When it comes to second drafts,</v>

1327
00:58:50.840 --> 00:58:51.673
<v Speaker 5>did you</v>

1328
00:58:51.880 --> 00:58:55.330
<v Speaker 2>you watch the choice on frontline during</v>
<v Speaker 2>the election?</v>

1329
00:58:55.420 --> 00:58:58.570
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was this amazing documentary about</v>

1330
00:58:58.571 --> 00:59:02.250
<v Speaker 2>hillary clinton and Donald Trump and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>shows you exactly who they are and why</v>

1331
00:59:02.350 --> 00:59:04.480
<v Speaker 2>they are the way that they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hillary clinton,</v>

1332
00:59:04.481 --> 00:59:08.740
<v Speaker 2>who cares at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but trump is so interesting.</v>

1333
00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:11.950
<v Speaker 2>Like basically he was raised with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>father that was extremely harsh,</v>

1334
00:59:12.010 --> 00:59:15.040
<v Speaker 2>not loving it all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he found this father figure,</v>

1335
00:59:15.041 --> 00:59:18.880
<v Speaker 2>this guy ray cohn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was this like an extremely</v>

1336
00:59:18.881 --> 00:59:22.010
<v Speaker 2>aggressive lawyer in new,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was</v>

1337
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:25.220
<v Speaker 1>a big in the mccarthy erA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a prosecutor in the mccarthy</v>

1338
00:59:25.250 --> 00:59:29.270
<v Speaker 1>communism trials and cones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whole strategy and philosophy was when</v>

1339
00:59:29.271 --> 00:59:32.900
<v Speaker 1>someone hits you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hit them back on a level that's so</v>

1340
00:59:33.050 --> 00:59:37.520
<v Speaker 1>disproportionately out of control that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they forget about the thing that you are</v>

1341
00:59:37.580 --> 00:59:39.950
<v Speaker 1>even talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the example of,</v>

1342
00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:41.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how he got sued for racial</v>

1343
00:59:41.631 --> 00:59:43.910
<v Speaker 1>discrimination is getting sued for</v>
<v Speaker 1>racial discrimination.</v>

1344
00:59:43.911 --> 00:59:45.140
<v Speaker 1>That's a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember that.</v>

1345
00:59:45.950 --> 00:59:50.600
<v Speaker 1>And he sued the people that Were suing</v>
<v Speaker 1>him for $25,000,000 in 1970.</v>

1346
00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:54.020
<v Speaker 1>So it's like now the story is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1347
00:59:54.700 --> 00:59:57.590
<v Speaker 1>a $25,000,000 suit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>donald trump's suing some poor kid for</v>

1348
00:59:57.591 --> 01:00:01.130
<v Speaker 1>$25 million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's talking about the original</v>

1349
01:00:01.131 --> 01:00:03.080
<v Speaker 1>thing anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're only looking at this flashy,</v>

1350
01:00:03.081 --> 01:00:07.250
<v Speaker 1>insane pt barnum level lawsuit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The racial discrimination thing was in</v>

1351
01:00:07.251 --> 01:00:08.240
<v Speaker 1>regards to housing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1352
01:00:08.450 --> 01:00:10.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That basIcally there was a,</v>

1353
01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:15.580
<v Speaker 1>they were setting up the systems where</v>
<v Speaker 1>black people and latinos wouldn't get,</v>

1354
01:00:17.330 --> 01:00:21.200
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't be allowed into trump housing</v>
<v Speaker 1>through like weird coded language or</v>

1355
01:00:21.201 --> 01:00:22.034
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

1356
01:00:22.780 --> 01:00:24.770
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's definitely a very litigious guy.</v>

1357
01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:27.240
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is fascinating that this woman who</v>

1358
01:00:27.241 --> 01:00:30.980
<v Speaker 1>is suing him for sexual harassing or</v>
<v Speaker 1>groping or what is she?</v>

1359
01:00:30.981 --> 01:00:33.380
<v Speaker 1>What is exact?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a gloria allred thing.</v>

1360
01:00:34.190 --> 01:00:35.330
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the suit that you're</v>

1361
01:00:35.331 --> 01:00:37.100
<v Speaker 1>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are they still going?</v>

1362
01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:38.000
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the thing.</v>

1363
01:00:38.001 --> 01:00:40.220
<v Speaker 1>He just claimed immunity because he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>the president.</v>

1364
01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:45.500
<v Speaker 1>Like this woman was suing him before she</v>
<v Speaker 1>was one of the ones that sued him once</v>

1365
01:00:45.501 --> 01:00:47.570
<v Speaker 1>he became president or once he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>running,</v>

1366
01:00:47.780 --> 01:00:51.500
<v Speaker 1>she came out like one of the last few to</v>
<v Speaker 1>came out and gloria allred was behind</v>

1367
01:00:51.501 --> 01:00:52.450
<v Speaker 1>her and everybody was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1368
01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:55.340
<v Speaker 1>see this coming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's gloria allred's in your corner.</v>

1369
01:00:55.341 --> 01:00:56.031
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1370
01:00:56.031 --> 01:00:57.890
<v Speaker 1>I See what's going on here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm just trying to get paid.</v>

1371
01:00:58.100 --> 01:01:00.410
<v Speaker 1>But okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone's trying to get paid jump claims</v>

1372
01:01:00.411 --> 01:01:03.560
<v Speaker 1>immunity from apprentice contestants</v>
<v Speaker 1>lawsuit that somebody's trying to get</v>

1373
01:01:03.561 --> 01:01:03.800
<v Speaker 1>paid.</v>

1374
01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:06.380
<v Speaker 1>That's a fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could see that argument.</v>

1375
01:01:06.590 --> 01:01:09.230
<v Speaker 1>The other argument would be he's about</v>
<v Speaker 1>to become the president,</v>

1376
01:01:09.231 --> 01:01:12.890
<v Speaker 1>so a person who he's violated who was</v>
<v Speaker 1>willing to let it go when he was just</v>

1377
01:01:12.891 --> 01:01:15.740
<v Speaker 1>some weird guy selling steaks for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sharper image is now like,</v>

1378
01:01:15.980 --> 01:01:18.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm not gonna let this monster become</v>
<v Speaker 1>the president.</v>

1379
01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:20.390
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could look at it that way.</v>

1380
01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:22.150
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what is,</v>

1381
01:01:22.190 --> 01:01:24.360
<v Speaker 1>what did he do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he did,</v>

1382
01:01:24.660 --> 01:01:27.380
<v Speaker 1>but her claim that she's been pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>open about our clamp.</v>

1383
01:01:27.650 --> 01:01:29.330
<v Speaker 1>He made a passenger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1384
01:01:29.410 --> 01:01:30.440
<v Speaker 1>that's really it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>YeAh.</v>

1385
01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:34.400
<v Speaker 1>So it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not really like what it can</v>

1386
01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:36.320
<v Speaker 1>constitutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

1387
01:01:36.530 --> 01:01:38.300
<v Speaker 1>you're not talking about something</v>
<v Speaker 1>monstrous.</v>

1388
01:01:38.330 --> 01:01:39.290
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not talking about it.</v>

1389
01:01:39.740 --> 01:01:41.810
<v Speaker 1>But in this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gloria allred thing,</v>

1390
01:01:42.170 --> 01:01:42.910
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1391
01:01:42.910 --> 01:01:46.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gloria read like I was a woman and uh,</v>

1392
01:01:46.130 --> 01:01:48.800
<v Speaker 1>something was going down like that where</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to get paid.</v>

1393
01:01:49.340 --> 01:01:51.170
<v Speaker 1>That's who I'd go to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's her thing.</v>

1394
01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:52.550
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was some,</v>

1395
01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:57.710
<v Speaker 1>some article written about how many</v>
<v Speaker 1>cases of hers actually go to trial and</v>

1396
01:01:57.711 --> 01:02:00.560
<v Speaker 1>how many get settled and it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's a settlement person.</v>

1397
01:02:00.590 --> 01:02:03.130
<v Speaker 1>You ever been sued now you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1398
01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:04.460
<v Speaker 1>Clothes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about,</v>

1399
01:02:04.990 --> 01:02:08.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lIne in my book and uh,</v>

1400
01:02:08.590 --> 01:02:13.590
<v Speaker 1>and it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you realize immediately that it was a</v>

1401
01:02:13.821 --> 01:02:16.130
<v Speaker 1>stupid line and one that if I had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had,</v>

1402
01:02:16.131 --> 01:02:18.590
<v Speaker 1>had hindsight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just never would have put it in and</v>

1403
01:02:18.591 --> 01:02:23.591
<v Speaker 1>the person right to be upset and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you realize very quickly that</v>

1404
01:02:26.190 --> 01:02:28.260
<v Speaker 1>this is poker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're just playing poker,</v>

1405
01:02:28.590 --> 01:02:32.490
<v Speaker 1>like it costs so much money for you to</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to trial and defend yourself if you,</v>

1406
01:02:32.491 --> 01:02:34.020
<v Speaker 1>even if you felt like you did nothing</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong,</v>

1407
01:02:34.021 --> 01:02:35.940
<v Speaker 1>which in this cAse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1408
01:02:36.180 --> 01:02:37.950
<v Speaker 1>I probably wouldn't have even made that</v>
<v Speaker 1>claim.</v>

1409
01:02:38.030 --> 01:02:39.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing about writing a memoir is it's</v>

1410
01:02:39.991 --> 01:02:42.560
<v Speaker 1>all like these wisps of memory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1411
01:02:42.570 --> 01:02:45.480
<v Speaker 1>and you're just like grabbing stuff and</v>
<v Speaker 1>throwing it in and like you have to.</v>

1412
01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:47.760
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like you have to write the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first one in order to realize like,</v>

1413
01:02:47.790 --> 01:02:49.320
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here are the responsible ways to do</v>

1414
01:02:49.321 --> 01:02:51.480
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't just like grab memories</v>

1415
01:02:51.630 --> 01:02:54.420
<v Speaker 1>thinking that all of your memories</v>
<v Speaker 1>belong to you because other people are</v>

1416
01:02:54.421 --> 01:02:55.380
<v Speaker 1>in them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1417
01:02:55.650 --> 01:02:59.790
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically it's like if you could defend</v>

1418
01:02:59.791 --> 01:03:01.860
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you have a defense will cost you</v>

1419
01:03:01.861 --> 01:03:06.240
<v Speaker 1>$200,000 or you could settle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I no longer buy this idea</v>

1420
01:03:06.241 --> 01:03:08.940
<v Speaker 1>that like if you settled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an implication of guilt.</v>

1421
01:03:08.941 --> 01:03:10.200
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's coMplete bullshit.</v>

1422
01:03:10.590 --> 01:03:14.580
<v Speaker 1>Anybody thAt's been sued is realizing</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reality that like you could fight</v>

1423
01:03:14.581 --> 01:03:17.780
<v Speaker 1>for your honor and it'll cost you double</v>
<v Speaker 1>the amount for you to just say here's</v>

1424
01:03:17.781 --> 01:03:19.750
<v Speaker 1>some money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know a bunch of people that have</v>

1425
01:03:19.751 --> 01:03:23.130
<v Speaker 1>been sued and settled when they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely 100 percent innocent and they</v>

1426
01:03:23.131 --> 01:03:25.800
<v Speaker 1>actually passed a rule at the ufc.</v>

1427
01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:29.100
<v Speaker 1>Were you not allowed to take pictures</v>
<v Speaker 1>choking people because of it?</v>

1428
01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:30.590
<v Speaker 1>Because people would ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1429
01:03:30.620 --> 01:03:33.330
<v Speaker 1>chuck liddell come choke me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take a picture.</v>

1430
01:03:33.331 --> 01:03:36.780
<v Speaker 1>You put me in a rear naked choke hold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both chocolate dell and matt hugheS were</v>

1431
01:03:36.781 --> 01:03:39.420
<v Speaker 1>sued.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chocolate dell wound up settling and he</v>

1432
01:03:39.421 --> 01:03:42.300
<v Speaker 1>absolutely didn't do anything wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this guy had a picture of him</v>

1433
01:03:42.301 --> 01:03:43.710
<v Speaker 1>getting choked and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1434
01:03:43.740 --> 01:03:45.210
<v Speaker 1>this guy hurt me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'S a killer.</v>

1435
01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:46.920
<v Speaker 1>You hurt me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the picture.</v>

1436
01:03:47.130 --> 01:03:48.870
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty cut and dry here.</v>

1437
01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:50.790
<v Speaker 1>And the other one was mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was the same thing.</v>

1438
01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.610
<v Speaker 1>This guy wanted matt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was choking him so mad he was choked</v>

1439
01:03:53.611 --> 01:03:57.720
<v Speaker 1>him and this guy wound up suing them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they do an investigation on the guy</v>

1440
01:03:57.810 --> 01:04:00.660
<v Speaker 1>and like they go into it and they find</v>
<v Speaker 1>out that this guy is a corrupt cop.</v>

1441
01:04:00.810 --> 01:04:04.320
<v Speaker 1>So the guy winds up going to jail for</v>
<v Speaker 1>being a corrupt cop.</v>

1442
01:04:04.350 --> 01:04:07.110
<v Speaker 1>Hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He started this whole cascade that</v>

1443
01:04:07.111 --> 01:04:08.910
<v Speaker 1>eventually wound up with him being in</v>
<v Speaker 1>jail.</v>

1444
01:04:08.940 --> 01:04:09.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean people are.</v>

1445
01:04:10.350 --> 01:04:12.020
<v Speaker 1>LiTigiousness is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

1446
01:04:12.090 --> 01:04:14.280
<v Speaker 1>is a monster of our age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it works.</v>

1447
01:04:14.281 --> 01:04:15.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it works really well.</v>

1448
01:04:15.380 --> 01:04:17.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean a company that I'm part of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got sued recently,</v>

1449
01:04:18.070 --> 01:04:20.640
<v Speaker 1>some weird funky patent lawsuit and</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1450
01:04:20.670 --> 01:04:21.750
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do we do here?</v>

1451
01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:23.310
<v Speaker 1>And it was one of those things where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1452
01:04:23.370 --> 01:04:25.860
<v Speaker 1>if you settle you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get this amount,</v>

1453
01:04:26.300 --> 01:04:28.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you give them this amount.</v>

1454
01:04:28.230 --> 01:04:30.390
<v Speaker 1>If you go to trial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to cost you in legal fees</v>

1455
01:04:30.391 --> 01:04:33.870
<v Speaker 1>three times that even if you win,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's chocolate l supposed to do it.</v>

1456
01:04:34.290 --> 01:04:34.921
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chuck,</v>

1457
01:04:34.921 --> 01:04:37.110
<v Speaker 1>you could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could defend yourself and maybe when</v>

1458
01:04:37.410 --> 01:04:40.590
<v Speaker 1>you could spend $250,000 and maybe when</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though you're right,</v>

1459
01:04:40.650 --> 01:04:44.670
<v Speaker 1>or you could write this check for</v>
<v Speaker 1>$20,000 and never think about it again.</v>

1460
01:04:44.790 --> 01:04:46.380
<v Speaker 1>It's like I get that.</v>

1461
01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:50.340
<v Speaker 1>What's weird about trump being so</v>
<v Speaker 1>litigious is that the republicans were</v>

1462
01:04:50.341 --> 01:04:52.620
<v Speaker 1>the ones that made it almost impossible</v>
<v Speaker 1>to sue people.</v>

1463
01:04:52.830 --> 01:04:55.680
<v Speaker 1>That's their whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you saw that hot coffee documentary?</v>

1464
01:04:55.770 --> 01:04:56.910
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So fucking good.</v>

1465
01:04:56.950 --> 01:04:59.490
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was a republican talking point.</v>

1466
01:04:59.491 --> 01:05:00.930
<v Speaker 1>It's like we have to start with tort</v>
<v Speaker 1>reform,</v>

1467
01:05:00.931 --> 01:05:03.750
<v Speaker 1>tort reform,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then all of a sudden there were all</v>

1468
01:05:03.950 --> 01:05:04.650
<v Speaker 1>these like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1469
01:05:04.650 --> 01:05:07.680
<v Speaker 1>meaningless and frivolous lawsuits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a bIg talking point in the glp</v>

1470
01:05:07.681 --> 01:05:11.220
<v Speaker 1>and all of a sudden now trump is like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most suing this mother fucker that's</v>

1471
01:05:11.221 --> 01:05:12.840
<v Speaker 1>ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever touched anything.</v>

1472
01:05:12.900 --> 01:05:14.470
<v Speaker 1>Would you hear him talk about it during</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1473
01:05:15.210 --> 01:05:16.290
<v Speaker 1>during the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1474
01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:18.340
<v Speaker 1>run for president?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was talking about</v>

1475
01:05:18.370 --> 01:05:21.250
<v Speaker 2>people writing things about you that</v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't true,</v>

1476
01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:24.430
<v Speaker 2>and we're going to change the laws.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to change the law so we can</v>

1477
01:05:24.460 --> 01:05:27.130
<v Speaker 2>go after those people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's harvey firestone or trump.</v>

1478
01:05:27.131 --> 01:05:28.340
<v Speaker 2>They're doing right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1479
01:05:28.341 --> 01:05:29.460
<v Speaker 2>that was trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

01:05:29.470 --> 01:05:32.390
<v Speaker 2>I was not good now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hover fire thing that maybe that was too</v>

1481
01:05:32.620 --> 01:05:33.910
<v Speaker 2>deep of a cut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to.</v>

1482
01:05:34.270 --> 01:05:36.340
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody wanted that would be more like,</v>

1483
01:05:36.940 --> 01:05:39.580

<v Speaker 2>I just don't know.</v>

1484
01:05:39.581 --> 01:05:44.581
<v Speaker 2>A good trump says I can't make that</v>
<v Speaker 2>speaks to your spirit.</v>

1485
01:05:45.010 --> 01:05:46.210
<v Speaker 2>Does it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That you can't find that.</v>

1486

<v Speaker 2>You're good at tyson.</v>

1487
01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:49.240

<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty good.</v>

1488
01:05:49.330 --> 01:05:50.590
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's difficult.</v>

1490
01:05:53.410 --> 01:05:54.880

01:06:30.790 --> 01:06:32.380
<v Speaker 2>Like captain crunch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know about that guy.</v>

1509
01:06:32.890 --> 01:06:35.710
<v Speaker 2>He's an interesting dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew that dude really when I was a</v>

<v Speaker 2>little boy explain who he is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1511
01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:40.600
<v Speaker 2>so captain crunch is one of the first</v>
<v Speaker 2>phone freak hackers and the thing that</v>

1512
01:06:40.601 --> 01:06:44.030
<v Speaker 2>he did is he found a whistle and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>captain crunch box and he found that it</v>

1513
01:06:44.110 --> 01:06:46.780
<v Speaker 2>had the tonality that if you play it</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the phone,</v>

1514
01:06:47.020 --> 01:06:51.760
<v Speaker 2>like whatever the tones that the phone</v>
<v Speaker 2>was hearing were similar to the dial</v>

1515
01:06:51.761 --> 01:06:55.120
<v Speaker 2>tones that would connect people to long</v>
<v Speaker 2>distance so he could get free long</v>

1516
01:06:55.121 --> 01:06:55.690
<v Speaker 2>distance.</v>

1517
01:06:55.690 --> 01:06:58.230

<v Speaker 2>to the guy,</v>

1606
01:10:24.591 --> 01:10:27.590
<v Speaker 2>my grandma came out and was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chased the guy away.</v>

1607
01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:30.020
<v Speaker 2>So if it wasn't for these negotiation</v>
<v Speaker 2>skills,</v>

1608
01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:31.790
<v Speaker 2>that's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be in a sex dungeon.</v>

1609
01:10:31.791 --> 01:10:31.990
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1610
01:10:31.990 --> 01:10:33.040
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you were annoying.</v>

1611
01:10:33.041 --> 01:10:35.590
<v Speaker 5>You had the guy away from me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now that's hilarious.</v>

1612
01:10:35.710 --> 01:10:36.970
<v Speaker 5>even a child molester,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was like,</v>

1613
01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:38.230
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1614
01:10:38.260 --> 01:10:39.820
<v Speaker 5>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>forget it.</v>

1615
01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:41.020
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can keep it.</v>

1616
01:10:41.140 --> 01:10:45.430
<v Speaker 5>I was on my way out the door with this</v>
<v Speaker 5>guy and the lady who worked the counter</v>

1617
01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:49.720
<v Speaker 5>at the library or the librarian screamed</v>
<v Speaker 5>at joseph,</v>

1618
01:10:49.721 --> 01:10:52.870
<v Speaker 5>you get away from that man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He just got out of jail.</v>

1619
01:10:52.930 --> 01:10:57.930
<v Speaker 5>Jesus and the guy ran.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He ran and I started crying and just</v>

1620
01:10:58.181 --> 01:11:01.240
<v Speaker 5>crying and crying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The joe rogan experience could have been</v>

1621
01:11:01.241 --> 01:11:05.460
<v Speaker 5>so different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1622
01:11:06.190 --> 01:11:08.440
<v Speaker 5>the Guy just got out of jail.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He probably did want to go back to jail</v>

1623
01:11:08.441 --> 01:11:10.980
<v Speaker 5>again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do those little things,</v>

1624
01:11:11.070 --> 01:11:14.820
<v Speaker 2>minutes and seconds between you and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>most dastardly thing.</v>

1625
01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:15.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only that,</v>

1626
01:11:15.780 --> 01:11:17.190
<v Speaker 2>this is 1970,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1627
01:11:17.191 --> 01:11:19.350
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good luck catching that guy like,</v>

1628
01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:21.420
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever almost died?</v>

1629
01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:24.810
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the most dangerous thing you've</v>

1630
01:11:24.811 --> 01:11:25.561
<v Speaker 2>ever done?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1631
01:11:25.561 --> 01:11:26.940
<v Speaker 2>jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1632
01:11:27.510 --> 01:11:32.160
<v Speaker 2>Fight the fight and die and a drive safe</v>
<v Speaker 2>or drive unsafe.</v>

1633
01:11:32.370 --> 01:11:36.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember I was a kid and we were</v>

1634
01:11:36.001 --> 01:11:36.750
<v Speaker 2>always like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1635
01:11:36.750 --> 01:11:41.470
<v Speaker 2>exploring places to go smoke weed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was like when you're young,</v>

1636
01:11:41.630 --> 01:11:42.900
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe it's different now,</v>

1637
01:11:42.901 --> 01:11:44.860
<v Speaker 2>now that weed's legal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you're young and we,</v>

1638
01:11:44.870 --> 01:11:46.740
<v Speaker 2>it was illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like you always were like looking</v>

1639
01:11:46.741 --> 01:11:48.850
<v Speaker 2>for these cubbies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just smoke weed.</v>

1640
01:11:49.210 --> 01:11:51.330
<v Speaker 2>And so you'll appreciate this as a bay</v>
<v Speaker 2>area guy.</v>

1641
01:11:51.630 --> 01:11:52.410
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1642
01:11:52.410 --> 01:11:57.410
<v Speaker 2>somebody found this a chain link area</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you could get over and get onto</v>

1643
01:11:58.201 --> 01:11:58.790
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1644
01:11:58.790 --> 01:12:01.140
<v Speaker 2>the bart tracks where you would go.</v>

1645
01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:03.960
<v Speaker 2>I've been in the bar tracks before</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I was a graffiti writer when I</v>

1646
01:12:03.961 --> 01:12:05.520
<v Speaker 2>was a kid and so we would sneak down</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

1647
01:12:05.521 --> 01:12:10.521
<v Speaker 2>but this was like a very narrow liquid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a foot long walkway and we end.</v>

1648
01:12:10.710 --> 01:12:15.600
<v Speaker 2>Somebody said that there was like a room</v>
<v Speaker 2>inside of the tunnel that was between</v>

1649
01:12:15.601 --> 01:12:18.660
<v Speaker 2>oakland and contra costa county,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there was this little,</v>

1650
01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:20.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how they knew that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like a little anti chamber.</v>

1651
01:12:20.851 --> 01:12:22.770
<v Speaker 2>We were always like looking for anti</v>
<v Speaker 2>chambers to like,</v>

1652
01:12:23.010 --> 01:12:26.720
<v Speaker 2>there was another one that was like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>sewer tunnel in oakland in rockridge</v>

1653
01:12:26.730 --> 01:12:28.260
<v Speaker 2>that I could show somebody where it is</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now,</v>

1654
01:12:28.261 --> 01:12:32.220
<v Speaker 2>but it's basically you go down and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>would bring flashlights and hairspray</v>

1655
01:12:32.221 --> 01:12:35.520
<v Speaker 2>and lighter so that we could like torch</v>
<v Speaker 2>spiders if we saw there was a little</v>

1656
01:12:35.521 --> 01:12:38.000
<v Speaker 2>anti chamber there too and there was an</v>
<v Speaker 2>anti chamber,</v>

1657
01:12:38.010 --> 01:12:40.320
<v Speaker 2>like a little know a room inside of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>tunnel,</v>

1658
01:12:40.321 --> 01:12:41.210
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a.</v>

1659
01:12:41.300 --> 01:12:42.750
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why it was there,</v>

1660
01:12:42.780 --> 01:12:45.330
<v Speaker 2>but there was like this little sewer</v>
<v Speaker 2>room in there that this guy fro hawk</v>

1661
01:12:45.331 --> 01:12:48.900
<v Speaker 2>lived in and there was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was like a black punk rocker.</v>

1662
01:12:48.990 --> 01:12:50.220
<v Speaker 2>He lived there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did.</v>

1663
01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:54.560
<v Speaker 2>He had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he lived on the lawn on a lawn of like a</v>

1664
01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:57.090
<v Speaker 2>pool folding chair down there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He slept.</v>

1665
01:12:57.091 --> 01:12:59.160
<v Speaker 2>I slept there one night actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>

1666
01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:01.410
<v Speaker 2>so we were always just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you not relate to that,</v>

1667
01:13:01.411 --> 01:13:02.760
<v Speaker 2>like you're always like looking at you</v>
<v Speaker 2>and your friends,</v>

1668
01:13:02.761 --> 01:13:07.140
<v Speaker 2>like looking for a weird place to do ill</v>
<v Speaker 2>explore.</v>

1669
01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:08.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly what to do that kinship.</v>

1670
01:13:08.910 --> 01:13:11.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we were in there and I was like,</v>

1671
01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:15.600
<v Speaker 2>I was kind of chubby when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they made me go with the back.</v>

1672
01:13:15.630 --> 01:13:17.400
<v Speaker 2>It was like a one person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1673
01:13:17.550 --> 01:13:19.860
<v Speaker 2>walkway to get to the room in the middle</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the tunnel,</v>

1674
01:13:19.861 --> 01:13:22.830
<v Speaker 2>not the sewer tunnel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now the bart train tunnel and we're</v>

1675
01:13:22.831 --> 01:13:25.140
<v Speaker 2>on this little one foot walkway.</v>

1676
01:13:25.470 --> 01:13:29.600
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was aT the back of the line and we're</v>

1677
01:13:29.610 --> 01:13:33.870
<v Speaker 2>walking towards the room and of course</v>
<v Speaker 2>we will get into the tunnel and we could</v>

1678
01:13:33.871 --> 01:13:38.871
<v Speaker 2>feel all of a sudden like the air got</v>
<v Speaker 2>hot and sucked out of the tunnel and it</v>

1679
01:13:39.211 --> 01:13:39.870
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh.</v>

1680
01:13:39.870 --> 01:13:42.170
<v Speaker 2>And you could hear that level of like</v>
<v Speaker 2>bbb,</v>

1681
01:13:42.210 --> 01:13:45.720
<v Speaker 2>bbb beep and the train was coming and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>

1682
01:13:46.290 --> 01:13:49.200
<v Speaker 2>it was so close to us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>

1683
01:13:49.530 --> 01:13:51.390
<v Speaker 2>my memory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if my memory is accurate,</v>

1684
01:13:51.391 --> 01:13:52.880
<v Speaker 2>but my memory is that it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1685
01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:56.350
<v Speaker 2>this as close as this mic is to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like food,</v>

1686
01:13:56.580 --> 01:13:59.190
<v Speaker 2>food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we were all like up against the</v>

1687
01:13:59.191 --> 01:14:01.620
<v Speaker 2>wall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the funny part was that we all</v>

1688
01:14:01.621 --> 01:14:06.070
<v Speaker 2>stopped and then the train stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember they pulled the,</v>

1689
01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:08.700
<v Speaker 2>like the train stopped in the tunnel and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they must have maybe they saw us or</v>

1690
01:14:08.701 --> 01:14:11.930
<v Speaker 2>something and somehow it stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I</v>

1691
01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:14.290
<v Speaker 1>don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's not an accurate memory,</v>

1692
01:14:14.291 --> 01:14:16.350
<v Speaker 1>but I feel like yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the train stopped and I,</v>

1693
01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:20.260
<v Speaker 1>I know that the people at the front of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the line screamed,</v>

1694
01:14:20.770 --> 01:14:25.540
<v Speaker 1>turn around and like run,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now all of a sudden fat moshe,</v>

1695
01:14:25.900 --> 01:14:28.990
<v Speaker 1>young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fat moshe wiifm is at the front of the</v>

1696
01:14:28.991 --> 01:14:29.800
<v Speaker 1>line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1697
01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:32.920
<v Speaker 1>And it's like a strip stand by me</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation because I'm like chubby,</v>

1698
01:14:33.050 --> 01:14:34.900
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's all this wind coming at me</v>

1699
01:14:34.901 --> 01:14:36.970
<v Speaker 1>because the wind is all been pushed by</v>
<v Speaker 1>the train.</v>

1700
01:14:37.180 --> 01:14:41.860
<v Speaker 1>So I'm like trying to run from the train</v>
<v Speaker 1>conductor and they're screaming all my</v>

1701
01:14:41.861 --> 01:14:43.180
<v Speaker 1>friends like run,</v>

<v Speaker 1>The worst,</v>

1703
01:14:47.140 --> 01:14:49.300
<v Speaker 1>scariest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>craziest experiences.</v>

1704
01:14:49.660 --> 01:14:53.720
<v Speaker 1>And then the train finally pulled off</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the we'd like hopped back over and</v>

1705
01:14:53.770 --> 01:14:56.850
<v Speaker 1>like shaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd like smoked weed in the just in</v>

<v Speaker 1>public are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck it,</v>

1707
01:14:58.060 --> 01:15:00.340

1708
01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:05.620
<v Speaker 1>Me and a buddy of mine in high school</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopped on the back of the tea in boston,</v>

1709
01:15:06.350 --> 01:15:07.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the um,</v>

1710
01:15:07.790 --> 01:15:10.240
<v Speaker 1>public transport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a train essentially.</v>

1711
01:15:10.990 --> 01:15:15.640
<v Speaker 1>It stopped and we jumped onto the tracks</v>
<v Speaker 1>and climbed onto the back and wrote it.</v>

1712
01:15:15.850 --> 01:15:17.770
<v Speaker 1>The train served on the back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done that.</v>

1713
01:15:17.771 --> 01:15:18.670
<v Speaker 1>Not on the train,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but on the,</v>

1714
01:15:18.730 --> 01:15:20.500
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the buses,</v>

1715
01:15:20.530 --> 01:15:24.100
<v Speaker 1>the ac transit buses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a trick where you could grab</v>

1716
01:15:24.101 --> 01:15:25.930
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there used to be like a handle on the</v>

1717
01:15:25.931 --> 01:15:29.050
<v Speaker 1>back of the bus and you put your feet on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bumper and right,</v>

1718
01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:33.160
<v Speaker 1>like basically write it like you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a illegal immigrant or something</v>

1719
01:15:33.250 --> 01:15:36.310
<v Speaker 1>and we would just do that for fun from</v>
<v Speaker 1>one if you want to take like one stop or</v>

1720
01:15:36.311 --> 01:15:37.720
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was so scary.</v>

1721
01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:41.650
<v Speaker 1>It was so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the risk of like falling off</v>

1722
01:15:41.651 --> 01:15:43.060
<v Speaker 1>of that thing was so dumb.</v>

1723
01:15:43.210 --> 01:15:44.530
<v Speaker 1>You were on top of it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1724
01:15:44.531 --> 01:15:45.520
<v Speaker 1>we were on the back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1725
01:15:45.521 --> 01:15:46.900
<v Speaker 1>just holding on just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

1726
01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:49.210
<v Speaker 1>it's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like standing on something and holding</v>

1727
01:15:49.211 --> 01:15:51.280
<v Speaker 1>onto something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it wasn't a good grip.</v>

1728
01:15:51.330 --> 01:15:52.280
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1729
01:15:52.380 --> 01:15:54.250
<v Speaker 1>And if there was anything that really</v>
<v Speaker 1>bumped you,</v>

1730
01:15:54.460 --> 01:15:56.440
<v Speaker 1>not that it would on a train,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if it did,</v>

1731
01:15:56.920 --> 01:15:59.200
<v Speaker 1>most likely I wouldn't let go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1732
01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:01.720
<v Speaker 1>it was fun though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Being young was very fun.</v>

1733
01:16:01.750 --> 01:16:03.550
<v Speaker 1>Stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Being stupid was fun.</v>

1734
01:16:03.820 --> 01:16:05.770
<v Speaker 1>It's just amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you think about how many times</v>

1735
01:16:05.830 --> 01:16:07.090
<v Speaker 1>things like that happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>

1736
01:16:07.091 --> 01:16:09.070
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was that time like you asked me,</v>

1737
01:16:09.130 --> 01:16:10.400
<v Speaker 1>did I do anything dangerous?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1738
01:16:10.470 --> 01:16:11.680
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me think.</v>

1739
01:16:12.060 --> 01:16:14.090
<v Speaker 1>And you have to go over these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1740
01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:17.050
<v Speaker 1>I did a lot of stupid shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of climbing things you shouldn't</v>

1741
01:16:17.051 --> 01:16:18.160
<v Speaker 1>have climbed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

1742
01:16:18.310 --> 01:16:19.450
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1743
01:16:19.750 --> 01:16:22.120
<v Speaker 1>We'd start a fire once in a warehouse.</v>

1744
01:16:23.410 --> 01:16:25.540
<v Speaker 1>I remember once we found this chemical</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>

1745
01:16:25.541 --> 01:16:28.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a way somebody broke into a car and</v>

1746
01:16:28.541 --> 01:16:30.850
<v Speaker 1>found all this chemical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it was,</v>

1747
01:16:30.851 --> 01:16:34.300
<v Speaker 1>but it was some like volatile flammable</v>
<v Speaker 1>chemical.</v>

1748
01:16:34.750 --> 01:16:39.100
<v Speaker 1>And there was this cement slide at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>elementary school in the neighborhood</v>

1749
01:16:39.101 --> 01:16:41.950
<v Speaker 1>that we lived in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we poured the chemical down the</v>

1750
01:16:41.951 --> 01:16:46.951
<v Speaker 1>slide and lit it on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just not familiar with the concept of</v>

1751
01:16:47.531 --> 01:16:49.270
<v Speaker 1>explosives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was,</v>

1752
01:16:49.300 --> 01:16:51.250
<v Speaker 1>there was a wall of flame,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it was,</v>

1753
01:16:51.251 --> 01:16:54.390
<v Speaker 1>but it was so big that we were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we were on acid and,</v>

1754
01:16:54.630 --> 01:16:57.730
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we were in the after this big old</v>

1755
01:16:57.731 --> 01:16:59.800
<v Speaker 1>wall of sliding flame,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1756
01:17:00.020 --> 01:17:02.770
<v Speaker 1>like the cut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were chilling out in this place,</v>

1757
01:17:02.771 --> 01:17:06.820
<v Speaker 1>the grassy field up above there and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cops came and they were like,</v>

1758
01:17:06.821 --> 01:17:09.730
<v Speaker 1>we've heard reports that there's someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>playing with a flame thrower.</v>

1759
01:17:09.830 --> 01:17:12.860
<v Speaker 1>I remember we laughed so much at peace</v>
<v Speaker 1>ops because like,</v>

1760
01:17:13.780 --> 01:17:15.470
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now that was a good memory.</v>

1761
01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:20.600
<v Speaker 1>Well we were a lighting bottle rockets</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this field and I'm one of the bottle</v>

1762
01:17:20.601 --> 01:17:25.480
<v Speaker 1>rockets ignited some grass and I stomped</v>
<v Speaker 1>on some of the grass but then some,</v>

1763
01:17:25.530 --> 01:17:28.250
<v Speaker 1>it started out real small,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a laptop size fire,</v>

1764
01:17:28.251 --> 01:17:29.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stomped on it,</v>

1765
01:17:29.691 --> 01:17:32.090
<v Speaker 1>but it just kept going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was going left and right.</v>

1766
01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:36.110
<v Speaker 1>And then you try to circle around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then the side of it gets bigger and</v>

1767
01:17:36.111 --> 01:17:37.790
<v Speaker 1>then you can't catch it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it got to the point where like,</v>

1768
01:17:37.850 --> 01:17:38.900
<v Speaker 1>oh fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't do this.</v>

1769
01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:40.640
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't stop this out,</v>

1770
01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:45.760
<v Speaker 1>and then it's whoosh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it became a fire and we were</v>

1771
01:17:46.191 --> 01:17:50.990
<v Speaker 1>like 13 and we ran and we got to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>street right when we got to the street.</v>

1772
01:17:50.991 --> 01:17:51.800
<v Speaker 1>Just dumb luck.</v>

1773
01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:54.410
<v Speaker 1>Aqap was there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just gave it up right away.</v>

1774
01:17:54.420 --> 01:17:58.070
<v Speaker 1>We started firing and the cop was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get the fuck outta here.</v>

1775
01:17:58.071 --> 01:18:02.090
<v Speaker 1>And we ran and we ran and then the</v>
<v Speaker 1>firetruck came and then we assessed it.</v>

1776
01:18:02.091 --> 01:18:04.460
<v Speaker 1>The next day we went by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't go anywhere near it.</v>

1777
01:18:04.461 --> 01:18:06.440
<v Speaker 1>We were just hoping and praying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like to this day,</v>

1778
01:18:06.441 --> 01:18:10.640
<v Speaker 1>my parents don't know I did it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hoping and praying that nobody died</v>

1779
01:18:10.670 --> 01:18:11.570
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1780
01:18:11.630 --> 01:18:14.570
<v Speaker 1>we didn't go to jail so we didn't tell</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody about it.</v>

1781
01:18:14.620 --> 01:18:15.800
<v Speaker 1>Then we went the next day and it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

1782
01:18:15.801 --> 01:18:20.000
<v Speaker 1>it's massive surface area of fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything was black.</v>

1783
01:18:20.001 --> 01:18:24.140
<v Speaker 1>This enormous field,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like several football fields sized.</v>

1784
01:18:24.480 --> 01:18:26.670
<v Speaker 1>Obviously it's number 13.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1785
01:18:26.690 --> 01:18:31.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember that we were once out in,</v>

1786
01:18:31.341 --> 01:18:32.960
<v Speaker 1>we were all on mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember this.</v>

1787
01:18:33.170 --> 01:18:34.970
<v Speaker 1>this is all when I'm like 13,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

1788
01:18:35.020 --> 01:18:37.400
<v Speaker 1>Jesus christ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the problem.</v>

1789
01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:38.420
<v Speaker 1>That's why I got sober,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so yeah.</v>

1790
01:18:38.510 --> 01:18:42.590
<v Speaker 1>You're a bad example though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For someone who uses drugs as well.</v>

1791
01:18:42.591 --> 01:18:44.540
<v Speaker 1>If you do drugs and fucks your brain up</v>
<v Speaker 1>because look,</v>

1792
01:18:44.541 --> 01:18:46.620
<v Speaker 1>you're very smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>DId it.</v>

1793
01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:49.250
<v Speaker 1>Did a lot of acid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of mushrooms.</v>

1794
01:18:49.251 --> 01:18:50.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I loved it.</v>

1795
01:18:50.421 --> 01:18:51.590
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I loved it.</v>

1796
01:18:51.591 --> 01:18:54.700
<v Speaker 1>we talked about it last time I was here</v>
<v Speaker 1>at how much I fondly remember I'm</v>

1797
01:18:55.130 --> 01:18:57.470
<v Speaker 1>psychedelics anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you,</v>

1798
01:18:57.471 --> 01:19:00.450
<v Speaker 1>you're sober because of other things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1799
01:19:00.530 --> 01:19:01.520
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in reality,</v>

1800
01:19:01.521 --> 01:19:04.820
<v Speaker 1>I think we talked about this last time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in reality it's like now that I look</v>

1801
01:19:04.821 --> 01:19:05.654
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1802
01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:08.210
<v Speaker 1>especially writing that book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the book covers all of this stuff,</v>

1803
01:19:08.211 --> 01:19:10.790
<v Speaker 1>all these wayward youth stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these insane.</v>

1804
01:19:10.940 --> 01:19:13.130
<v Speaker 1>It's called catcher in the rye in case</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody wants it.</v>

1805
01:19:13.190 --> 01:19:17.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm very proud of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like once I wrote that book I</v>

1806
01:19:17.961 --> 01:19:21.530
<v Speaker 1>realized like I was a wild kid just like</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1807
01:19:21.610 --> 01:19:22.443
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

1808
01:19:22.510 --> 01:19:24.800
<v Speaker 1>or maybe wilder than when you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>really young,</v>

1809
01:19:24.801 --> 01:19:27.320
<v Speaker 1>but I was a wild kid with a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>behavioral issues,</v>

1810
01:19:27.620 --> 01:19:29.540
<v Speaker 1>a lot of mental health stuff going on.</v>

1811
01:19:29.570 --> 01:19:32.270
<v Speaker 1>Not like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not like chronic and systemic,</v>

1812
01:19:32.271 --> 01:19:37.271
<v Speaker 1>but like circumstantial and I spent a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of time thinking of myself as like</v>

1813
01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:42.920
<v Speaker 1>an alcoholic and I don't knoW what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if I even believe that,</v>

1814
01:19:42.940 --> 01:19:45.800
<v Speaker 1>that I didn't even know if I believe in</v>
<v Speaker 1>that label any longer.</v>

1815
01:19:46.130 --> 01:19:48.240
<v Speaker 1>But you don't believe in the label.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1816
01:19:48.610 --> 01:19:53.390
<v Speaker 1>I just talk about this afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean basically I don't know is</v>

1817
01:19:53.391 --> 01:19:57.050
<v Speaker 1>basically it has nothing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People always want to ask you that.</v>

1818
01:19:57.140 --> 01:19:57.501
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1819
01:19:57.501 --> 01:19:58.370
<v Speaker 1>I got sober.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was 15,</v>

1820
01:19:58.371 --> 01:19:59.031
<v Speaker 1>and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1821
01:19:59.031 --> 01:19:59.721
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>

1822
01:19:59.721 --> 01:20:01.280
<v Speaker 1>What were you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

1823
01:20:01.370 --> 01:20:03.260
<v Speaker 1>then the answer is always very</v>
<v Speaker 1>embarrassing.</v>

1824
01:20:03.340 --> 01:20:07.530
<v Speaker 1>So nothing asset,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pot drinking and now I realize like it's</v>

1825
01:20:07.531 --> 01:20:08.550
<v Speaker 1>not really embarrassing</v>

1826
01:20:09.180 --> 01:20:12.570
<v Speaker 2>because the only reason it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>embarrassing is because I've been like,</v>

1827
01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:15.990
<v Speaker 2>I want to say heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the people will go,</v>

1828
01:20:15.991 --> 01:20:17.070
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I acknowledged that.</v>

1829
01:20:17.071 --> 01:20:19.200
<v Speaker 2>That's legitimate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't have that story.</v>

1830
01:20:19.201 --> 01:20:22.830
<v Speaker 2>That's Not the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The truth is really the question is why</v>

1831
01:20:22.831 --> 01:20:24.330
<v Speaker 2>did it should be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why did you get sober?</v>

1832
01:20:24.331 --> 01:20:27.330
<v Speaker 2>And the answer probably would be because</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a juvenile delinquent and that was</v>

1833
01:20:27.331 --> 01:20:32.310
<v Speaker 2>the way out that I found at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I probably could take mushrooms now</v>

1834
01:20:32.311 --> 01:20:33.930
<v Speaker 2>and before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know,</v>

1835
01:20:34.090 --> 01:20:35.520
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>

1836
01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:40.740
<v Speaker 2>That's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So do you ever think about exploring it?</v>

1837
01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:42.100
<v Speaker 2>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1838
01:20:42.180 --> 01:20:44.310
<v Speaker 2>I Think we did talk about this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1839
01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:45.960
<v Speaker 2>But definitely I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what,</v>

1840
01:20:45.990 --> 01:20:49.680
<v Speaker 2>what keeps you from doing that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it this distinction that you have</v>

1841
01:20:49.681 --> 01:20:52.050
<v Speaker 2>where you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a sober person for sure.</v>

1842
01:20:52.051 --> 01:20:54.030
<v Speaker 2>There's that membrane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think about that a lot.</v>

1843
01:20:54.050 --> 01:20:55.260
<v Speaker 2>It's like membrane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're either,</v>

1844
01:20:55.290 --> 01:20:58.110
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you are either you are or you are</v>

1845
01:20:58.111 --> 01:20:58.944
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1846
01:20:58.950 --> 01:21:01.210
<v Speaker 2>And that's part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Part of it is a,</v>

1847
01:21:01.211 --> 01:21:02.190
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1848
01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:04.710
<v Speaker 2>a harm reductIon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>best practices type of thing.</v>

1849
01:21:04.810 --> 01:21:06.920
<v Speaker 2>It's like everything's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1850
01:21:06.990 --> 01:21:09.120
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot of drug addicts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot of people that use drugs</v>

1851
01:21:09.121 --> 01:21:10.740
<v Speaker 2>and have great experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1852
01:21:11.250 --> 01:21:13.740
<v Speaker 2>But I know a lot of people that got</v>
<v Speaker 2>sober and thought,</v>

1853
01:21:13.741 --> 01:21:14.550
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll try again,</v>

1854
01:21:14.550 --> 01:21:16.260
<v Speaker 2>and then they're all fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1855
01:21:16.680 --> 01:21:18.720
<v Speaker 2>I don't necessarily think that would be</v>
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>

1856
01:21:18.750 --> 01:21:20.120
<v Speaker 2>but I do know that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1857
01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:23.580
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and one a and finally I just,</v>

1858
01:21:23.581 --> 01:21:25.320
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess I worry about like,</v>

1859
01:21:25.590 --> 01:21:28.170
<v Speaker 2>just habituated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean,</v>

1860
01:21:28.171 --> 01:21:30.780
<v Speaker 2>it hasn't affected you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems to have affected you in the</v>

1861
01:21:30.781 --> 01:21:32.320
<v Speaker 2>opposite way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1862
01:21:32.950 --> 01:21:34.050
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're better.</v>

1863
01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:36.420
<v Speaker 2>But everybody's different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody is different.</v>

1864
01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:40.440
<v Speaker 2>And what I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doing coke doing meth.</v>

1865
01:21:40.470 --> 01:21:43.270
<v Speaker 2>There's no argument for meth or coke</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe even see.</v>

1866
01:21:43.320 --> 01:21:45.690
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's no argument from math</v>
<v Speaker 2>period that just doesn't.</v>

1867
01:21:45.750 --> 01:21:48.780
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not going to expand your mind.</v>

1868
01:21:48.781 --> 01:21:51.090
<v Speaker 2>Although I guess there's an argument for</v>
<v Speaker 2>adderall.</v>

1869
01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:52.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you want to sit down to write a</v>

1870
01:21:52.771 --> 01:21:55.230
<v Speaker 2>script over a weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is an argument to be made for.</v>

1871
01:21:55.231 --> 01:21:57.510
<v Speaker 2>That might be a bullshit script about</v>
<v Speaker 2>cleaning</v>

1872
01:22:00.020 --> 01:22:02.730
<v Speaker 2>script,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about organizing your underwear based on</v>

1873
01:22:02.731 --> 01:22:03.620
<v Speaker 2>color.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1874
01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:04.740
<v Speaker 2>drugs are weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1875
01:22:04.830 --> 01:22:06.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big drug advocate.</v>

1876
01:22:06.570 --> 01:22:08.310
<v Speaker 2>Big time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

1877
01:22:08.330 --> 01:22:08.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1878
01:22:08.990 --> 01:22:10.900
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that they're powerful and</v>

1879
01:22:11.010 --> 01:22:16.010
<v Speaker 2>unnecessary and I want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want psychedelic experiences.</v>

1880
01:22:16.570 --> 01:22:17.880
<v Speaker 2>I've had them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I had them.</v>

1881
01:22:17.910 --> 01:22:21.450
<v Speaker 2>I always say like the funny part about</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking mind expanding drugs when you're</v>

1882
01:22:21.630 --> 01:22:24.810
<v Speaker 2>12 years old is that there's very little</v>
<v Speaker 2>mind upon which to expand,</v>

1883
01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:27.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like doing these things that are</v>

1884
01:22:27.001 --> 01:22:30.810
<v Speaker 2>like rom das,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ask like deep diving into the fractal</v>

1885
01:22:30.811 --> 01:22:34.050
<v Speaker 2>pool of existential reality and there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing there.</v>

1886
01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:37.350
<v Speaker 2>You're just like point it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a weird experience.</v>

1887
01:22:37.351 --> 01:22:39.210
<v Speaker 2>Like you're having these freakouts and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1888
01:22:39.211 --> 01:22:42.360
<v Speaker 2>your mind is bursting open,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

1889
01:22:43.170 --> 01:22:46.890
<v Speaker 2>I certainly wish I would like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience of trying that with an adult</v>

1890
01:22:46.891 --> 01:22:50.100
<v Speaker 2>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe It'd be worse maybe,</v>

1891
01:22:50.101 --> 01:22:51.800
<v Speaker 2>but I doubt it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1892
01:22:51.810 --> 01:22:54.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that what would drugs do,</v>

1893
01:22:54.541 --> 01:22:57.780
<v Speaker 2>what any drug does is it alters your</v>
<v Speaker 2>brain chemistry,</v>

1894
01:22:57.781 --> 01:23:00.210
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And everybody's brain chemistry is</v>

1895
01:23:00.211 --> 01:23:02.940
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So some people could use a cup of</v>

1896
01:23:02.941 --> 01:23:03.780
<v Speaker 2>coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1897
01:23:03.781 --> 01:23:06.130
<v Speaker 2>And some people it freaks them out and</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people</v>

1898
01:23:06.130 --> 01:23:10.240
<v Speaker 1>could use some pot and some people just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people that I know that</v>

1899
01:23:10.270 --> 01:23:14.770
<v Speaker 1>they just go into deep paranoid fits if</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get involved with marijuana in any</v>

1900
01:23:14.771 --> 01:23:15.551
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shape or form.</v>

1901
01:23:15.551 --> 01:23:17.920
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas I kind of liked that self</v>

1902
01:23:17.921 --> 01:23:20.760
<v Speaker 1>exploratory and examination aspect of it</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think,</v>

1903
01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:26.360
<v Speaker 1>I think it's far too easy to be cocky as</v>
<v Speaker 1>far too easy to not be introspective or</v>

1904
01:23:27.071 --> 01:23:29.200
<v Speaker 1>that paranoid feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it just,</v>

1905
01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:33.840
<v Speaker 1>it forces your brain to examine all</v>
<v Speaker 1>these perhaps uncomfortable truths.</v>

1906
01:23:33.841 --> 01:23:36.510
<v Speaker 1>So you're saying you'd like the paranoia</v>
<v Speaker 1>aspect of it?</v>

1907
01:23:36.610 --> 01:23:38.500
<v Speaker 1>I think it's beneficial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really interesting.</v>

1908
01:23:38.501 --> 01:23:40.690
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard that before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's beneficial because I think</v>

1909
01:23:40.691 --> 01:23:44.390
<v Speaker 1>what you're paranoid of when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>paranoid the.</v>

1910
01:23:44.500 --> 01:23:47.200
<v Speaker 1>Unless you're thinking the government</v>
<v Speaker 1>spying on you and I'm like,</v>

1911
01:23:47.201 --> 01:23:50.110
<v Speaker 1>I know a buddy who was a big time</v>
<v Speaker 1>pothead and he started thinking that</v>

1912
01:23:50.111 --> 01:23:52.270
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the government was waiting outside</v>

1913
01:23:52.271 --> 01:23:54.700
<v Speaker 1>of his house with a car and they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching them constantly.</v>

1914
01:23:54.700 --> 01:23:56.980
<v Speaker 1>Everywhere he went and as soon as he</v>
<v Speaker 1>left they would come out of the bushes,</v>

1915
01:23:56.981 --> 01:24:00.280
<v Speaker 1>like he got a little crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think he had his own issues.</v>

1916
01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:01.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was also dealing with.</v>

1917
01:24:01.811 --> 01:24:04.120
<v Speaker 1>His dad was dying and it was a lot lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on,</v>

1918
01:24:04.121 --> 01:24:06.140
<v Speaker 1>but that's one of the weird parts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>drugs is that.</v>

1919
01:24:06.420 --> 01:24:09.190
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think that I have this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you obviously don't,</v>

1920
01:24:09.191 --> 01:24:13.030
<v Speaker 1>but one of the weird things about drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have latent mental illness and</v>

1921
01:24:13.031 --> 01:24:15.580
<v Speaker 1>you get into your brain and you pour a</v>
<v Speaker 1>chemical on it,</v>

1922
01:24:15.640 --> 01:24:17.530
<v Speaker 1>it'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll unlock itself,</v>

1923
01:24:17.590 --> 01:24:20.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get the dragon will uncoil and make</v>

1924
01:24:20.861 --> 01:24:22.460
<v Speaker 1>itself known.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that.</v>

1925
01:24:22.510 --> 01:24:24.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm not worried about that for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that is interesting.</v>

1926
01:24:24.461 --> 01:24:27.250
<v Speaker 1>I've seen that a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a dude's like 25 and it's like,</v>

1927
01:24:27.251 --> 01:24:28.750
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'll try start trying</v>

1928
01:24:28.780 --> 01:24:31.750
<v Speaker 1>psychedelics or weed and it just goes in</v>
<v Speaker 1>there and it's like,</v>

1929
01:24:31.751 --> 01:24:32.920
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't know you had that.</v>

1930
01:24:32.980 --> 01:24:35.230
<v Speaker 1>Not that they wouldn't have had that</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience anyway,</v>

1931
01:24:35.231 --> 01:24:38.950
<v Speaker 1>but it's definitely a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a incidental onset of mental illness.</v>

1932
01:24:38.980 --> 01:24:40.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a study they did about the</v>

1933
01:24:40.991 --> 01:24:45.220
<v Speaker 1>correlation between marijuana and</v>
<v Speaker 1>schizophrenia because a lot of people</v>

1934
01:24:45.221 --> 01:24:47.290
<v Speaker 1>have tried to connect marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>schizophrenia.</v>

1935
01:24:47.291 --> 01:24:50.410
<v Speaker 1>And what they found is essentially the</v>
<v Speaker 1>numbers are stable.</v>

1936
01:24:50.650 --> 01:24:52.900
<v Speaker 1>It's one percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one percent across the board.</v>

1937
01:24:52.901 --> 01:24:56.230
<v Speaker 1>So it's one percent that whether they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing pot or not doing pot.</v>

1938
01:24:56.650 --> 01:25:00.130
<v Speaker 1>And so you can make that correlation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this guy got into pot and look at</v>

1939
01:25:00.131 --> 01:25:03.550
<v Speaker 1>all these examples of people who started</v>
<v Speaker 1>smoking pot and became schizophrenic,</v>

1940
01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:05.110
<v Speaker 1>but that's just humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1941
01:25:05.350 --> 01:25:09.520
<v Speaker 1>There's a certain percentage of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that just will become mentally ill.</v>

1942
01:25:09.580 --> 01:25:11.530
<v Speaker 1>That's a scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the scariest thing.</v>

1943
01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:15.460
<v Speaker 1>I have a brother who has schizophrenia</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's like the scariest thing ever.</v>

1944
01:25:15.490 --> 01:25:18.550
<v Speaker 1>Regular kid rig,</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally regular sweet person.</v>

1945
01:25:18.610 --> 01:25:20.110
<v Speaker 1>And then all of a sudden one day It was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1946
01:25:20.440 --> 01:25:20.980
<v Speaker 1>are you okay?</v>

1947
01:25:20.980 --> 01:25:23.230
<v Speaker 1>And then couple of years later it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1948
01:25:23.290 --> 01:25:24.020
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1949
01:25:24.020 --> 01:25:27.370
<v Speaker 1>you are done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your brain is cooked and what is,</v>

1950
01:25:27.430 --> 01:25:28.720
<v Speaker 1>what is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens?</v>

1951
01:25:29.260 --> 01:25:30.100
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1952
01:25:30.290 --> 01:25:34.540
<v Speaker 1>he was in New York so I didn't see the</v>
<v Speaker 1>entire uncoiling but it's basically,</v>

1953
01:25:34.650 --> 01:25:37.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he starts weird and gets weirder and</v>

1954
01:25:37.151 --> 01:25:38.410
<v Speaker 1>then at a certain point you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1955
01:25:38.411 --> 01:25:40.240
<v Speaker 1>you're different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a different human being.</v>

1956
01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:45.010
<v Speaker 1>Like you just giggling to himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smirking weird outbursts,</v>

1957
01:25:45.070 --> 01:25:47.020
<v Speaker 1>just scary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scary stuff.</v>

1958
01:25:47.021 --> 01:25:49.900
<v Speaker 1>And it's like your brain turns on you</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's no.</v>

1959
01:25:50.260 --> 01:25:52.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean it happened around when my dad</v>
<v Speaker 1>died.</v>

1960
01:25:52.450 --> 01:25:54.640
<v Speaker 1>So I sometimes I think to myself like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1961
01:25:54.641 --> 01:25:57.370
<v Speaker 1>maybe that was it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe in the same way you pour weed on</v>

1962
01:25:57.371 --> 01:25:58.204
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe if you pour,</v>

1963
01:25:58.240 --> 01:26:02.980
<v Speaker 1>you pour trauma on it because trauma's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain chemistry buster to 100 percent</v>

1964
01:26:03.110 --> 01:26:04.040
<v Speaker 1>and so I think</v>

1965
01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:08.540
<v Speaker 2>that probably like popped the scab open</v>
<v Speaker 2>or whatever that was in his brain,</v>

1966
01:26:08.541 --> 01:26:10.490
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a year later was lIke,</v>

1967
01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:11.720
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a different person.</v>

1968
01:26:11.721 --> 01:26:14.060
<v Speaker 2>You don't have the same personality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't.</v>

1969
01:26:14.180 --> 01:26:17.450
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just shows you how much of you is</v>

1970
01:26:17.451 --> 01:26:21.440
<v Speaker 2>just brain chemistry and how lucky you</v>
<v Speaker 2>are in the same way.</v>

1971
01:26:21.441 --> 01:26:23.090
<v Speaker 2>You were lucky not to get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1972
01:26:23.390 --> 01:26:27.140
<v Speaker 2>kidnapped by a monster at the library.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're also lucky that the monster</v>

1973
01:26:27.141 --> 01:26:29.020
<v Speaker 2>wasn't living inside your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1974
01:26:29.300 --> 01:26:30.650
<v Speaker 2>me too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1975
01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:34.000
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's all sorts of dIfferent kinds of</v>

1976
01:26:34.001 --> 01:26:35.200
<v Speaker 3>mental illnesses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1977
01:26:35.390 --> 01:26:39.880
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure I've got a few right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like whether or not they're beneficial.</v>

1978
01:26:39.910 --> 01:26:41.350
<v Speaker 3>That's the other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I of the,</v>

1979
01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:44.650
<v Speaker 3>I was talking to michael irvin once the</v>
<v Speaker 3>football player and he was describing to</v>

1980
01:26:44.651 --> 01:26:47.950
<v Speaker 3>me what happens to someone's brain when</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're in the womb,</v>

1981
01:26:48.190 --> 01:26:50.910
<v Speaker 3>when the mother experiences violence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1982
01:26:51.100 --> 01:26:54.510
<v Speaker 3>the mother experiences any sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>violence or really bad neighborhoods or</v>

1983
01:26:54.760 --> 01:26:58.630
<v Speaker 3>around traumatic situations that it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it elevates the,</v>

1984
01:26:58.680 --> 01:27:01.150
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fight or flight response in the baby.</v>

1985
01:27:01.151 --> 01:27:06.151
<v Speaker 3>So kids come out of the womb,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like pre predetermined to overreact to</v>

1986
01:27:07.181 --> 01:27:09.310
<v Speaker 3>violent situations are dangerous</v>
<v Speaker 3>situations.</v>

1987
01:27:09.730 --> 01:27:12.100
<v Speaker 3>I definitely think I have that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>

1988
01:27:12.380 --> 01:27:14.710
<v Speaker 3>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I ramp up way too quick.</v>

1989
01:27:14.740 --> 01:27:17.050
<v Speaker 3>I calm myself and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm very aware of it.</v>

1990
01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:18.033
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1991
01:27:18.050 --> 01:27:21.100
<v Speaker 3>I control it and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know what it is,</v>

1992
01:27:21.490 --> 01:27:24.360
<v Speaker 3>but like if something goes on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I,</v>

1993
01:27:24.470 --> 01:27:29.470
<v Speaker 3>I hit red line,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like immediately laura goes from zero to</v>

1994
01:27:30.011 --> 01:27:34.690
<v Speaker 3>100 miles an hour in like a second.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's not usually manageable.</v>

1995
01:27:34.730 --> 01:27:38.510
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that maybe that's a link to our</v>

1996
01:27:38.511 --> 01:27:41.780
<v Speaker 2>earlier conversation about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>patriarchy.</v>

1997
01:27:42.290 --> 01:27:45.200
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you can pass on incidental trauma to</v>

1998
01:27:45.201 --> 01:27:47.750
<v Speaker 2>a child because the mom is experiencing</v>
<v Speaker 2>violence.</v>

1999
01:27:48.140 --> 01:27:50.900
<v Speaker 2>If a woman is living in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2000
01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:55.960
<v Speaker 2>infrastructural like 20 700,000 layers</v>
<v Speaker 2>deep of infrastructural oppression,</v>

2001
01:27:58.010 --> 01:28:01.220
<v Speaker 2>then it stands to figure that a female</v>
<v Speaker 2>child is born with a little bit of that</v>

2002
01:28:01.221 --> 01:28:05.840
<v Speaker 2>trauma too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a little bit of dna based like,</v>

2003
01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:08.600
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I won't fight that fight or maybe</v>

2004
01:28:08.601 --> 01:28:12.770
<v Speaker 2>I won't be pushy or maybe I won't be</v>
<v Speaker 2>allowed broad or maybe I won't,</v>

2005
01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>argue because that's not feminine or you</v>

2006
01:28:15.261 --> 01:28:18.620
<v Speaker 2>know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so all of that in,</v>

2007
01:28:18.650 --> 01:28:19.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trauma,</v>

2008
01:28:19.851 --> 01:28:23.090
<v Speaker 2>intergenerational trauma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which has been studied and proven,</v>

2009
01:28:23.510 --> 01:28:26.180
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is maybe is maybe in every woman that</v>

2010
01:28:26.181 --> 01:28:27.014
<v Speaker 2>you've ever met.</v>

2011
01:28:27.410 --> 01:28:28.550
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no doubt about it.</v>

2012
01:28:28.551 --> 01:28:30.740
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think all of us have some form of</v>

2013
01:28:30.741 --> 01:28:31.491
<v Speaker 3>programming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2014
01:28:31.491 --> 01:28:35.090
<v Speaker 3>if you ever been around a kid who has an</v>
<v Speaker 3>overly oppressive dad,</v>

2015
01:28:35.510 --> 01:28:36.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're,</v>

2016
01:28:36.411 --> 01:28:38.120
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're handicapped by it.</v>

2017
01:28:38.170 --> 01:28:38.931
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>literally,</v>

2018
01:28:38.931 --> 01:28:43.931
<v Speaker 3>like whether it's a boy or a girl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that their life is affected by this</v>

2019
01:28:43.971 --> 01:28:48.971
<v Speaker 3>overbearing person who's constantly</v>
<v Speaker 3>engaging in manipulation and control of</v>

2020
01:28:49.701 --> 01:28:50.534
<v Speaker 3>their reality.</v>

2021
01:28:50.910 --> 01:28:52.920
<v Speaker 2>That's what you get when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you ever had a.</v>

2022
01:28:53.010 --> 01:28:54.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you've had a friend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a drug addict.</v>

2023
01:28:54.960 --> 01:28:57.630
<v Speaker 2>The most tempting thought in the world</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you have a friend that's a drug</v>

2024
01:28:57.631 --> 01:28:59.550
<v Speaker 2>addict is just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't you just stop,</v>

2025
01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:02.100
<v Speaker 2>just stop doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stop it.</v>

2026
01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:07.160
<v Speaker 2>It seems so stoppable cause it's so</v>
<v Speaker 2>selfish and so like obviously the wrong</v>

2027
01:29:07.411 --> 01:29:10.500
<v Speaker 2>thing to do and you're over here doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>the right thing and such with such ease</v>

2028
01:29:10.950 --> 01:29:13.770
<v Speaker 2>and what having my brother's mental</v>
<v Speaker 2>illness,</v>

2029
01:29:13.771 --> 01:29:14.940
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my younger brother,</v>

2030
01:29:15.330 --> 01:29:18.390
<v Speaker 2>it made me realize is like you actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>have the same thought when there's a</v>

2031
01:29:18.391 --> 01:29:20.300
<v Speaker 2>mentally ill person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just with the,</v>

2032
01:29:20.420 --> 01:29:22.340
<v Speaker 2>the next reality is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2033
01:29:22.640 --> 01:29:25.470
<v Speaker 2>he really can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes everything clearer,</v>

2034
01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:27.030
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like sickness,</v>

2035
01:29:27.031 --> 01:29:29.670
<v Speaker 2>cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't say to the person stop because</v>

2036
01:29:29.671 --> 01:29:32.130
<v Speaker 2>you're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh you can't mental illness.</v>

2037
01:29:32.131 --> 01:29:34.350
<v Speaker 2>You say stop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you realize you can't drug</v>

2038
01:29:34.351 --> 01:29:36.570
<v Speaker 2>addiction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is like kind of a mental illness.</v>

2039
01:29:36.571 --> 01:29:40.740
<v Speaker 2>You say stop and it seems seductive to</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe that they could stop and if you</v>

2040
01:29:40.741 --> 01:29:42.990
<v Speaker 2>could really be compassionate and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2041
01:29:42.991 --> 01:29:44.390
<v Speaker 2>he can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like,</v>

2042
01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:46.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like compassionate nirvana.</v>

2043
01:29:46.910 --> 01:29:48.620
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you can take it to another place</v>

2044
01:29:48.621 --> 01:29:49.610
<v Speaker 5>too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>With gambling,</v>

2045
01:29:50.230 --> 01:29:53.270
<v Speaker 5>it's really the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So an emulation of human human</v>

2046
01:29:53.271 --> 01:29:55.160
<v Speaker 5>neurochemistry,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like somehow or another,</v>

2047
01:29:55.580 --> 01:29:59.870
<v Speaker 5>a betting money on things gives you that</v>
<v Speaker 5>charge that you cannot.</v>

2048
01:30:00.020 --> 01:30:02.960
<v Speaker 5>You can't escape the grip of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like there's a lot of people that are</v>

2049
01:30:03.020 --> 01:30:04.850
<v Speaker 5>really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really addicted to gambling.</v>

2050
01:30:04.851 --> 01:30:05.900
<v Speaker 5>I've seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy.</v>

2051
01:30:05.960 --> 01:30:08.690
<v Speaker 5>Which is really crazy that the</v>
<v Speaker 5>government has fucking legalized</v>

2052
01:30:08.691 --> 01:30:12.290
<v Speaker 5>gambling everywhere at gas stations.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those goddamn scratch tickets are</v>

2053
01:30:12.291 --> 01:30:15.740
<v Speaker 5>nothing more than legalized gambling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Lottery legalized gambling.</v>

2054
01:30:15.770 --> 01:30:17.420
<v Speaker 5>Are you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you're not anti-gambling though.</v>

2055
01:30:17.480 --> 01:30:18.313
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm for it.</v>

2056
01:30:18.340 --> 01:30:19.820
<v Speaker 5>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by the way I want it.</v>

2057
01:30:19.940 --> 01:30:21.620
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't do it a lot,</v>

2058
01:30:21.621 --> 01:30:25.350
<v Speaker 5>but like before I worked for the ufc,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I used to bet on fights all the time.</v>

2059
01:30:25.351 --> 01:30:26.870
<v Speaker 5>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't have the.</v>

2060
01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:29.990
<v Speaker 5>You don't have the bug,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the bug?</v>

2061
01:30:30.080 --> 01:30:32.570
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I used to enjoy betting on pool to play</v>

2062
01:30:32.630 --> 01:30:34.760
<v Speaker 5>pool a lot and I would gamble on pool</v>
<v Speaker 5>games,</v>

2063
01:30:35.120 --> 01:30:37.760
<v Speaker 5>but it just made it more thrilling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I never got addicted to it.</v>

2064
01:30:37.790 --> 01:30:41.930
<v Speaker 5>But you do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you run the risk,</v>

2065
01:30:42.230 --> 01:30:44.450
<v Speaker 5>you run the risk,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you run the risk of getting caught up in</v>

2066
01:30:44.451 --> 01:30:46.010
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe to a lesser extent than someone</v>

2067
01:30:46.011 --> 01:30:49.520
<v Speaker 5>who has an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People seem to have inherent issues with</v>

2068
01:30:49.521 --> 01:30:53.210
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like it gets you filipino woo.</v>

<v Speaker 5>after the war,</v>

2077
01:31:12.170 --> 01:31:15.440
<v Speaker 5>after the war,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Like if you were going to play chess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rook to king,</v>

01:32:50.770 --> 01:32:51.603
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2123
01:32:51.610 --> 01:32:55.420
<v Speaker 2>it's less thought out than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just messy and chaotic and what's</v>

2124
01:32:55.421 --> 01:32:58.270
<v Speaker 2>the most offensive in most insane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2125
01:32:58.271 --> 01:33:01.270
<v Speaker 2>most wild crazy attack that I can make.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

2126
01:33:01.660 --> 01:33:02.560
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

2127
01:33:02.630 --> 01:33:06.130
<v Speaker 2>there's a philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird kind of anarchistic</v>

2128
01:33:06.131 --> 01:33:08.410
<v Speaker 2>philosophy to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it started in four,</v>

2129
01:33:08.411 --> 01:33:09.620
<v Speaker 2>chan and kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2130
01:33:09.880 --> 01:33:11.830
<v Speaker 2>it bubbled out to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2131
01:33:12.130 --> 01:33:14.800
<v Speaker 2>to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anonymous is an outcropping of the</v>

2132
01:33:14.810 --> 01:33:16.540
<v Speaker 2>fortune.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't call them shit posters</v>

2133
01:33:16.541 --> 01:33:19.630
<v Speaker 2>because they have like at least kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>a cogent philosophy,</v>

2134
01:33:19.660 --> 01:33:20.740
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2135
01:33:20.741 --> 01:33:21.341
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>

2136
01:33:21.341 --> 01:33:25.120
<v Speaker 2>the shit posters are the people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you tweet something sincere about</v>

2137
01:33:25.121 --> 01:33:28.660
<v Speaker 2>how angry you are about trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden you see like 90 cartoons</v>

2138
01:33:28.670 --> 01:33:32.130
<v Speaker 2>of the most offensive thing that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>could possibly imagine.</v>

2139
01:33:32.140 --> 01:33:33.460
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why did these people,</v>

2140
01:33:33.670 --> 01:33:36.460
<v Speaker 2>why are they attacking me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's because they like looking for</v>

2141
01:33:36.461 --> 01:33:37.840
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Little whiny bitches.</v>

2142
01:33:37.841 --> 01:33:39.700
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2143
01:33:39.701 --> 01:33:40.331
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2144
01:33:40.331 --> 01:33:41.860
<v Speaker 2>we found a little tiny bits come this</v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

2145
01:33:41.861 --> 01:33:45.280
<v Speaker 2>And then all of a sudden it's just a</v>
<v Speaker 2>tidal wave of these things.</v>

2146
01:33:45.340 --> 01:33:46.660
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you call them,</v>

2147
01:33:46.990 --> 01:33:49.850
<v Speaker 2>if you say their name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where it gets really strange.</v>

2148
01:33:49.851 --> 01:33:54.220
<v Speaker 2>So she wears done exactly what she's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I looked at some posts that she made</v>

2149
01:33:54.221 --> 01:33:56.230
<v Speaker 2>recently about some magazine cover that</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was on,</v>

2150
01:33:56.650 --> 01:33:58.360
<v Speaker 2>showed up on my feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I read the comments.</v>

2151
01:33:58.361 --> 01:34:00.820
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jesus christ.</v>

2152
01:34:00.910 --> 01:34:01.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>

2153
01:34:01.781 --> 01:34:05.260
<v Speaker 2>if she was a ship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be so filled with rats.</v>

2154
01:34:05.261 --> 01:34:07.000
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to light a fire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2155
01:34:07.001 --> 01:34:07.834
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2156
01:34:07.850 --> 01:34:10.480
<v Speaker 2>it is like rats and barnacles too</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's just like all of a sudden</v>

2157
01:34:10.481 --> 01:34:11.830
<v Speaker 2>they're just like two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>

2158
01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:12.101
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>

2159
01:34:12.101 --> 01:34:12.630
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two.</v>

2160
01:34:12.630 --> 01:34:14.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But barnacles could be on a cool ship</v>

2161
01:34:14.830 --> 01:34:17.530
<v Speaker 2>and you get in there and there's a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of people drinking and have a good time</v>

2162
01:34:17.531 --> 01:34:20.950
<v Speaker 2>and barnacles on the outside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is rats beCause it's everywhere.</v>

2163
01:34:20.951 --> 01:34:23.380
<v Speaker 2>It's in the pantry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's in every aspect of it.</v>

2164
01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:26.980
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is a part of the new landscape and</v>

2165
01:34:27.090 --> 01:34:29.950
<v Speaker 2>where we live,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this digital landscape is filled with.</v>

2166
01:34:30.680 --> 01:34:32.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I don't,</v>

2167
01:34:33.400 --> 01:34:36.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't like them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously they're not nice but.</v>

2168
01:34:36.280 --> 01:34:38.650
<v Speaker 2>and I think decency is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a sad,</v>

2169
01:34:38.760 --> 01:34:41.960
<v Speaker 2>a collateral damage of the digital age,</v>

<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

2171
01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:47.350
<v Speaker 2>Somehow people Think that being in</v>
<v Speaker 2>decent as positive and that if somebody</v>

2172
01:34:47.351 --> 01:34:51.220
<v Speaker 2>disagrees with you politically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's fun and okay to just try to</v>

2173
01:34:51.221 --> 01:34:54.610
<v Speaker 2>destroy that person emotionally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you're not really communicating</v>

2174
01:34:54.611 --> 01:34:55.750
<v Speaker 2>with them in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in front of you.</v>

2175
01:34:55.780 --> 01:34:58.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly that that is a huge aspect of</v>

2176
01:34:58.521 --> 01:35:01.160
<v Speaker 2>being a person is looking at someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>while you communicate with that,</v>

2177
01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:03.650
<v Speaker 2>removed that there's consequences to</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2178
01:35:03.740 --> 01:35:04.310
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2179
01:35:04.310 --> 01:35:05.070
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pr,</v>

2180
01:35:05.070 --> 01:35:08.720
<v Speaker 2>a big problem is the other end and the d</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the internet has made othering so</v>

2181
01:35:08.810 --> 01:35:10.400
<v Speaker 2>simple and easy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2182
01:35:10.401 --> 01:35:14.030
<v Speaker 2>it's like the arcgis was watching this</v>
<v Speaker 2>documentary and they were talking about,</v>

2183
01:35:14.620 --> 01:35:17.030
<v Speaker 2>it was this really good documentary</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually about,</v>

2184
01:35:17.060 --> 01:35:20.420
<v Speaker 2>I forget the name of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was about this guy who he's a</v>

2185
01:35:20.421 --> 01:35:24.170
<v Speaker 2>black dude that confronts kkk members</v>
<v Speaker 2>like one on one,</v>

2186
01:35:24.380 --> 01:35:27.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he like talks to them and to them he</v>

2187
01:35:27.321 --> 01:35:30.410
<v Speaker 2>converts them and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's d hooded like 24 clansman or</v>

2188
01:35:30.411 --> 01:35:33.290
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there was a story or hooded them as</v>

2189
01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:34.450
<v Speaker 2>It were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What were,</v>

2190
01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:36.910
<v Speaker 2>what hood there.</v>

2191
01:35:39.420 --> 01:35:41.840
<v Speaker 2>There's actually an a very intense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen the documentary?</v>

2192
01:35:41.870 --> 01:35:42.381
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't,</v>

2193
01:35:42.381 --> 01:35:45.350
<v Speaker 2>but I've heard of it super intense</v>
<v Speaker 2>moment in the film because the whole</v>

2194
01:35:45.351 --> 01:35:48.950
<v Speaker 2>time you're with a guy so charismatic</v>
<v Speaker 2>and brilliant and interesting and you're</v>

2195
01:35:48.951 --> 01:35:49.341
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

2196
01:35:49.341 --> 01:35:51.470
<v Speaker 2>this guy's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy's righteous.</v>

2197
01:35:51.471 --> 01:35:52.520
<v Speaker 2>Can you look it up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>

2198
01:35:52.521 --> 01:35:53.780
<v Speaker 2>I can find it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's his name?</v>

2199
01:35:53.781 --> 01:35:56.900
<v Speaker 2>He's really fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamiel what's the moment?</v>

2200
01:35:57.200 --> 01:35:58.880
<v Speaker 2>so there's a moment in the documentary</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you're,</v>

2201
01:35:58.890 --> 01:36:00.380
<v Speaker 2>you're the whole time you're in there</v>
<v Speaker 2>going like,</v>

2202
01:36:00.381 --> 01:36:02.540
<v Speaker 2>this guy's righteous and awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's cool.</v>

2203
01:36:02.541 --> 01:36:04.910
<v Speaker 2>And d hooding these people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he goes and speaks with these</v>

2204
01:36:04.911 --> 01:36:09.040
<v Speaker 2>black lives matter activists who are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

2205
01:36:09.050 --> 01:36:11.210
<v Speaker 2>accidental courtesy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

2206
01:36:11.240 --> 01:36:14.830
<v Speaker 2>Daryl davis and race in America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2207
01:36:15.650 --> 01:36:17.900
<v Speaker 2>he's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then he goes and he talks to these</v>

2208
01:36:17.901 --> 01:36:22.620
<v Speaker 2>black lives matter activists and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>so angry with him there.</v>

2209
01:36:22.640 --> 01:36:27.590
<v Speaker 2>So not into what he's doing because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're basically like,</v>

2210
01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:31.760
<v Speaker 2>we were In the streets fighting for</v>
<v Speaker 2>black America and here you are spending</v>

2211
01:36:31.761 --> 01:36:34.790
<v Speaker 2>your entire life talking to these</v>
<v Speaker 2>racists and you've only,</v>

2212
01:36:35.210 --> 01:36:37.190
<v Speaker 2>you've only d hooded 24 of them.</v>

2213
01:36:37.400 --> 01:36:38.670
<v Speaker 2>But it's also.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's,</v>

2214
01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:40.010
<v Speaker 2>there's a point that they're making.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2215
01:36:40.011 --> 01:36:41.930
<v Speaker 2>what are you even doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's even the point of what you're</v>

2216
01:36:41.931 --> 01:36:45.020
<v Speaker 2>doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But his point is I'm making micro</v>

2217
01:36:45.021 --> 01:36:49.070
<v Speaker 2>victories and I'm converting people one</v>
<v Speaker 2>person at a time.</v>

2218
01:36:49.520 --> 01:36:52.190
<v Speaker 2>But there's a bigger conversation which</v>
<v Speaker 2>is really interesting.</v>

2219
01:36:53.060 --> 01:36:58.060
<v Speaker 2>Which is that the person that is closest</v>
<v Speaker 2>to you ideologically is more offensive</v>

2220
01:37:00.561 --> 01:37:03.320
<v Speaker 2>to you when they don't do what you want</v>
<v Speaker 2>them to.</v>

2221
01:37:03.321 --> 01:37:05.960
<v Speaker 2>Then the person that's furthest away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

2222
01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:10.070
<v Speaker 2>when a person calls me ju online,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some dude in the Philippines with like</v>

2223
01:37:10.071 --> 01:37:13.070
<v Speaker 2>an anime avatar and he puts like</v>
<v Speaker 2>antisemitic stuff.</v>

2224
01:37:13.340 --> 01:37:15.260
<v Speaker 2>I give a fuck about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not real.</v>

2225
01:37:15.320 --> 01:37:18.920
<v Speaker 2>That's not real to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when a person who lIke seems like</v>

2226
01:37:18.921 --> 01:37:22.650
<v Speaker 2>they should get it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who seems like they should know that</v>

2227
01:37:22.700 --> 01:37:25.820
<v Speaker 2>better says some weird antisemitic shit</v>
<v Speaker 2>or talks about like,</v>

2228
01:37:26.090 --> 01:37:28.040
<v Speaker 2>you know how cushner is connected.</v>

2229
01:37:28.040 --> 01:37:32.180
<v Speaker 2>Like the global zionism is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when it bothers me more.</v>

2230
01:37:32.181 --> 01:37:33.140
<v Speaker 2>Does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2231
01:37:33.141 --> 01:37:34.250
<v Speaker 2>No it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does.</v>

2232
01:37:34.251 --> 01:37:37.910
<v Speaker 2>Because you think they should know</v>
<v Speaker 2>better and they're ruining the cost</v>

2233
01:37:37.911 --> 01:37:40.040
<v Speaker 2>because they're connected to your idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2234
01:37:40.360 --> 01:37:43.370
<v Speaker 2>So at any rate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a story in there where he talks</v>

2235
01:37:43.371 --> 01:37:47.350
<v Speaker 2>about a talking to this person who's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a.</v>

2236
01:37:47.390 --> 01:37:50.840
<v Speaker 2>He lived in an all white town except one</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the klansmen that was d hood.</v>

2237
01:37:50.841 --> 01:37:54.500
<v Speaker 2>It talks about he lived in this all</v>
<v Speaker 2>white town and he was raised very racist</v>

2238
01:37:54.501 --> 01:37:57.900
<v Speaker 2>and that black people were the worst and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was one black family like the</v>

2239
01:37:57.901 --> 01:38:00.030
<v Speaker 2>johnson's or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and his father told him,</v>

2240
01:38:00.031 --> 01:38:02.730
<v Speaker 2>all black people are the worst of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>monkeys.</v>

2241
01:38:02.731 --> 01:38:05.700
<v Speaker 2>They're the worst except the johnsons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The johnsons are good.</v>

2242
01:38:05.730 --> 01:38:08.520
<v Speaker 2>They're good people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he had thIs realization,</v>

2243
01:38:08.521 --> 01:38:10.950
<v Speaker 2>this tickle in his brain of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

2244
01:38:11.070 --> 01:38:15.030
<v Speaker 2>my father hates all the black people</v>
<v Speaker 2>except the black family that he's met.</v>

2245
01:38:15.540 --> 01:38:19.650
<v Speaker 2>like all black people are bad except the</v>
<v Speaker 2>one group that he's actually met.</v>

2246
01:38:20.400 --> 01:38:22.740
<v Speaker 2>And that is like the phenomenon of</v>
<v Speaker 2>othering,</v>

2247
01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:23.633
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2248
01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:24.900
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>black people are bad.</v>

2249
01:38:24.930 --> 01:38:27.450
<v Speaker 2>Muslims are bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But actually my friend tom,</v>

2250
01:38:27.451 --> 01:38:30.600
<v Speaker 2>the muslim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's nice but muslims wanna kill me.</v>

2251
01:38:30.601 --> 01:38:33.360
<v Speaker 2>But the tom over here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a good dude.</v>

2252
01:38:34.030 --> 01:38:35.040
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

2253
01:38:35.250 --> 01:38:38.280
<v Speaker 2>I think othering is like the big one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the big problems that we have.</v>

2254
01:38:38.490 --> 01:38:39.300
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also,</v>

2255
01:38:39.300 --> 01:38:41.400
<v Speaker 2>I think what's going on with black lives</v>
<v Speaker 2>matter.</v>

2256
01:38:41.401 --> 01:38:44.400
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that's going on is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're in the middle of the battle</v>

2257
01:38:44.580 --> 01:38:46.240
<v Speaker 2>right in the middle of the battle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyday.</v>

2258
01:38:46.290 --> 01:38:49.080
<v Speaker 2>YOu wake up prime for battle getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>online,</v>

2259
01:38:49.081 --> 01:38:50.110
<v Speaker 2>you're active,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2260
01:38:50.120 --> 01:38:50.840
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2261
01:38:50.840 --> 01:38:53.470
<v Speaker 2>you're activating your membership,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2262
01:38:53.530 --> 01:38:55.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>organizing,</v>

2263
01:38:55.590 --> 01:38:57.720
<v Speaker 2>doing whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then this guy comes along and he's</v>

2264
01:38:57.721 --> 01:39:01.410
<v Speaker 2>doing something totally different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's out there talking to the klansmen.</v>

2265
01:39:01.450 --> 01:39:02.760
<v Speaker 2>You'll fuck those people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2266
01:39:03.030 --> 01:39:04.380
<v Speaker 2>Doing right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>

2267
01:39:04.381 --> 01:39:07.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was for my show that,</v>

2268
01:39:07.400 --> 01:39:09.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I'm doing my comedy central show.</v>

2269
01:39:09.691 --> 01:39:13.800
<v Speaker 2>We're doing like we just did a cultural</v>
<v Speaker 2>appropriation episode and I was</v>

2270
01:39:14.460 --> 01:39:15.390
<v Speaker 2>studying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I was studying.</v>

2271
01:39:15.450 --> 01:39:17.610
<v Speaker 2>I was like deep in the cultural</v>
<v Speaker 2>appropriation of the reading.</v>

2272
01:39:17.611 --> 01:39:19.590
<v Speaker 2>So much shit about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But one of the more interesting things</v>

2273
01:39:19.591 --> 01:39:23.640
<v Speaker 2>that said about black lives matter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of connected to this is that</v>

2274
01:39:23.641 --> 01:39:27.630
<v Speaker 2>one thing that happens with cultural</v>
<v Speaker 2>appropriation and things in general is</v>

2275
01:39:27.631 --> 01:39:31.170
<v Speaker 2>that people seize on language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're in like a crazy language war right</v>

2276
01:39:31.171 --> 01:39:31.651
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2277
01:39:31.651 --> 01:39:34.400
<v Speaker 2>Like so many of the phrases that we use,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2278
01:39:34.510 --> 01:39:36.690
<v Speaker 2>are so charged with secondary and</v>
<v Speaker 2>tertiary,</v>

2279
01:39:36.691 --> 01:39:38.820
<v Speaker 2>meaning that we can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't even mean anything anymore.</v>

2280
01:39:38.970 --> 01:39:42.690
<v Speaker 2>Like white privilege is a concept that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the moment you bring it up,</v>

2281
01:39:42.870 --> 01:39:45.600
<v Speaker 2>there's so many I levels of eye roll</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's like,</v>

2282
01:39:45.660 --> 01:39:48.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't even think it's a useful phrase</v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore because it's like the moment you</v>

2283
01:39:48.241 --> 01:39:51.420
<v Speaker 2>say white privilege than a person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the white person who you're saying it's</v>

2284
01:39:51.421 --> 01:39:54.690
<v Speaker 2>privileged just going like fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the minute someone saying fuck you,</v>

2285
01:39:54.820 --> 01:39:56.340
<v Speaker 2>your conversation has ended.</v>

2286
01:39:56.940 --> 01:40:00.090
<v Speaker 2>So the thIng they said about black lives</v>
<v Speaker 2>matter was also a lot of silly.</v>

2287
01:40:00.091 --> 01:40:01.950
<v Speaker 2>People use that expression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No doubt.</v>

2288
01:40:02.100 --> 01:40:05.940
<v Speaker 2>That's the weird baggage that it has.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's good.</v>

2289
01:40:05.941 --> 01:40:08.910
<v Speaker 2>The thing that we learned about that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>learned about cultural appropriation</v>

2290
01:40:08.911 --> 01:40:09.750
<v Speaker 2>because for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>

2291
01:40:09.810 --> 01:40:13.170
<v Speaker 2>I roll my eyes so deeply.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The concept of cultural appropriation,</v>

2292
01:40:13.171 --> 01:40:13.890
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2293
01:40:13.890 --> 01:40:15.780
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I shouldn't eat burritos anymore.</v>

2294
01:40:15.781 --> 01:40:19.050
<v Speaker 2>Is that what you're also.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always think I'm always really tickled</v>

2295
01:40:19.051 --> 01:40:20.880
<v Speaker 2>with the idea of like the person saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2296
01:40:20.881 --> 01:40:24.420
<v Speaker 2>you shouldn't wear that tribal gear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it's like go to the third world</v>

2297
01:40:24.421 --> 01:40:29.370
<v Speaker 2>country where the market is and tell</v>
<v Speaker 2>them like impoverished a merchant like,</v>

2298
01:40:29.400 --> 01:40:32.550
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry I can't buy this bit of silk</v>

2299
01:40:32.551 --> 01:40:35.220
<v Speaker 2>from you because it's racist for me to</v>
<v Speaker 2>wear it.</v>

2300
01:40:35.221 --> 01:40:36.180
<v Speaker 2>That person's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please,</v>

2301
01:40:36.210 --> 01:40:37.650
<v Speaker 2>please buy it and wear it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2302
01:40:37.930 --> 01:40:38.880
<v Speaker 2>or you know what I'm saying?</v>

2303
01:40:38.940 --> 01:40:40.170
<v Speaker 2>Or like the family that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2304
01:40:40.171 --> 01:40:42.970
<v Speaker 2>it would be a great honor if you would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the sorry or whatever.</v>

2305
01:40:43.320 --> 01:40:47.970
<v Speaker 2>So it's a big eye-roll except then you</v>
<v Speaker 2>start to think like upon reading it it's</v>

2306
01:40:47.971 --> 01:40:48.481
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2307
01:40:48.481 --> 01:40:51.540
<v Speaker 2>the thing is it's not incidental,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's emotional.</v>

2308
01:40:51.900 --> 01:40:55.420
<v Speaker 2>It's like deeper than,</v>
<v Speaker 2>than just like trying to parse out the</v>

2309
01:40:55.421 --> 01:40:58.960
<v Speaker 2>logic and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh well I found an example where your</v>

2310
01:40:59.020 --> 01:41:02.260
<v Speaker 2>thing falls apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's emotional.</v>

2311
01:41:02.261 --> 01:41:04.080
<v Speaker 2>There's an emotional reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when,</v>

2312
01:41:04.090 --> 01:41:06.860
<v Speaker 2>when somebody you know affects,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2313
01:41:07.420 --> 01:41:09.400
<v Speaker 2>dreads up their hair even though you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

2314
01:41:09.401 --> 01:41:13.630
<v Speaker 2>but people have been dreading their hair</v>
<v Speaker 2>in other cultures for a million years.</v>

2315
01:41:13.631 --> 01:41:18.580
<v Speaker 2>Vikings had dreads and that is true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter because the person</v>

2316
01:41:18.581 --> 01:41:21.250
<v Speaker 2>that's in front of you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a black person that's going,</v>

2317
01:41:21.730 --> 01:41:25.900
<v Speaker 2>I have pain when I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have this pain that I'm looking at,</v>

2318
01:41:25.930 --> 01:41:27.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a person that's affecting my culture</v>

2319
01:41:27.551 --> 01:41:29.260
<v Speaker 2>without any of the negative parts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

2320
01:41:29.350 --> 01:41:31.600
<v Speaker 2>so you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can wear the hair and you can have</v>

2321
01:41:31.601 --> 01:41:31.990
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>

2322
01:41:31.990 --> 01:41:34.100
<v Speaker 3>why is that okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just because of the word culture,</v>

2323
01:41:34.220 --> 01:41:36.080
<v Speaker 3>because if that's the case with someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>else,</v>

2324
01:41:36.110 --> 01:41:38.720
<v Speaker 3>some someone else wearing something that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might find a failure.</v>

2325
01:41:38.780 --> 01:41:42.980
<v Speaker 3>What if you're a person that's extremely</v>
<v Speaker 3>a conservative when it comes to dress</v>

2326
01:41:42.981 --> 01:41:45.260
<v Speaker 3>and you see a woman in a short skirt and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have pain,</v>

2327
01:41:45.530 --> 01:41:48.290
<v Speaker 3>should that impose upon that woman's</v>
<v Speaker 3>ability to wear that skirt?</v>

2328
01:41:48.330 --> 01:41:49.141
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely,</v>

2329
01:41:49.141 --> 01:41:54.141
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not making a case that anybody's</v>
<v Speaker 2>pain ought to be automatically adopted</v>

2330
01:41:55.081 --> 01:41:57.330
<v Speaker 2>as like a behavioral standard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2331
01:41:57.331 --> 01:41:59.210
<v Speaker 2>That's not really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I,</v>

2332
01:41:59.270 --> 01:42:04.270
<v Speaker 2>I learned from this whole discussion is</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like it's not really about going.</v>

2333
01:42:05.190 --> 01:42:10.190
<v Speaker 2>No one is really saying except the most</v>
<v Speaker 2>emotionally kind of a inferior,</v>

2334
01:42:10.730 --> 01:42:13.910
<v Speaker 2>like the person that doesn't have the</v>
<v Speaker 2>language to express what they're really</v>

2335
01:42:13.911 --> 01:42:16.190
<v Speaker 2>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Almost no one that I read when I was</v>

2336
01:42:16.440 --> 01:42:19.520
<v Speaker 2>reading these real like intellectuals</v>
<v Speaker 2>and their concepts of cultural</v>

2337
01:42:19.521 --> 01:42:24.110
<v Speaker 2>appropriation is saying white people</v>
<v Speaker 2>should stop doing this stuff altogether.</v>

2338
01:42:24.290 --> 01:42:28.340
<v Speaker 2>Almost no one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't find one left wing woke article</v>

2339
01:42:28.341 --> 01:42:32.510
<v Speaker 2>that said white people should stop</v>
<v Speaker 2>adopting the culture of other,</v>

2340
01:42:32.900 --> 01:42:34.640
<v Speaker 2>of people of color.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2341
01:42:35.180 --> 01:42:39.470
<v Speaker 2>I read a lot of right wing think pieces</v>
<v Speaker 2>that were saying this is absurd.</v>

2342
01:42:39.500 --> 01:42:42.080
<v Speaker 2>Why are you telling us to stop adopting</v>
<v Speaker 2>these cultures?</v>

2343
01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:44.780
<v Speaker 2>Isn't all culture a melting pot and all</v>
<v Speaker 2>cultural borrowing,</v>

2344
01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:48.890
<v Speaker 2>but not once did I read somebody's</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying white people stopped this</v>

2345
01:42:48.891 --> 01:42:50.880
<v Speaker 2>altogether,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what did you read?</v>

2346
01:42:50.890 --> 01:42:52.130
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so mostly,</v>

2347
01:42:52.131 --> 01:42:55.670
<v Speaker 2>and I hope I can articulate this well</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'm not the best advocate for</v>

2348
01:42:55.671 --> 01:42:57.440
<v Speaker 2>this position because like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2349
01:42:57.441 --> 01:42:59.330
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one that I struggle with that's</v>

2350
01:42:59.331 --> 01:43:01.430
<v Speaker 2>dubious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dubious and difficult.</v>

2351
01:43:01.450 --> 01:43:04.700
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there are ridiculous parts of the</v>

2352
01:43:04.701 --> 01:43:08.590
<v Speaker 2>cultural appropriation argument,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one thing that like,</v>

2353
01:43:09.380 --> 01:43:13.400
<v Speaker 2>it's all connected to historical trauma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all deeper.</v>

2354
01:43:13.550 --> 01:43:16.910
<v Speaker 2>Like basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's see if I can articulate this well,</v>

2355
01:43:16.940 --> 01:43:18.410
<v Speaker 2>what this one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2356
01:43:18.750 --> 01:43:21.410
<v Speaker 2>this one person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I wish I could find his name</v>

2357
01:43:21.411 --> 01:43:22.510
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

2358
01:43:22.550 --> 01:43:25.910
<v Speaker 2>because he deserves it because he's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>really deep thinker about this stuff was</v>

2359
01:43:25.911 --> 01:43:27.480
<v Speaker 2>talking about was that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2360
01:43:27.710 --> 01:43:30.290
<v Speaker 2>we have racism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Racism is a,</v>

2361
01:43:30.620 --> 01:43:35.620
<v Speaker 2>a huge word that describes everything</v>
<v Speaker 2>from a white person like hugging their</v>

2362
01:43:36.621 --> 01:43:40.910
<v Speaker 2>purse closer to their chest when a black</v>
<v Speaker 2>person walks by or even like a weird,</v>

2363
01:43:40.911 --> 01:43:41.744
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2364
01:43:41.870 --> 01:43:45.980
<v Speaker 2>just the smallest little racial</v>
<v Speaker 2>weirdness all the way to lighting across</v>

2365
01:43:46.040 --> 01:43:49.520
<v Speaker 2>on somebody on somebody's lawn to</v>
<v Speaker 2>murdering someone.</v>

2366
01:43:49.520 --> 01:43:52.610
<v Speaker 2>LIke that's all encompassed and racism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they started trying to like parse it</v>

2367
01:43:52.611 --> 01:43:53.900
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are going,</v>

2368
01:43:54.020 --> 01:43:55.700
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you call someone a racist,</v>

2369
01:43:55.760 --> 01:43:56.481
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They go,</v>

2370
01:43:56.481 --> 01:43:58.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're calling me a monster.</v>

2371
01:43:58.251 --> 01:43:59.390
<v Speaker 2>And then somebody will go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>

2372
01:43:59.391 --> 01:44:03.710
<v Speaker 2>I meant like a systemically racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you need more specific</v>

2373
01:44:04.220 --> 01:44:07.220
<v Speaker 2>examples.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So cultural appropriation is one,</v>

2374
01:44:07.310 --> 01:44:09.070
<v Speaker 2>white privilege is another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's all these,</v>

2375
01:44:09.240 --> 01:44:12.710
<v Speaker 2>but still go back to what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what cultural appropriation.</v>

2376
01:44:12.711 --> 01:44:16.190
<v Speaker 2>Like you said that no one was saying</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't do it.</v>

2377
01:44:16.250 --> 01:44:17.110
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what.</v>

2378
01:44:17.480 --> 01:44:19.790
<v Speaker 2>So what are they doing when they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to chop someone's dreads off?</v>

2379
01:44:19.820 --> 01:44:21.480
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about the spa.</v>

2380
01:44:21.620 --> 01:44:22.710
<v Speaker 2>A spa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2381
01:44:22.790 --> 01:44:23.780
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what example?</v>

2382
01:44:23.781 --> 01:44:26.080
<v Speaker 2>You mean the san francisco state example</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the girl attacked guy.</v>

2383
01:44:26.190 --> 01:44:30.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean that girl was just inarticulately</v>
<v Speaker 2>expressing some insanity.</v>

2384
01:44:30.231 --> 01:44:31.760
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's defensible.</v>

2385
01:44:31.761 --> 01:44:34.070
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think most of the articles in the</v>

2386
01:44:34.190 --> 01:44:37.010
<v Speaker 2>stuff that I read about that specific</v>
<v Speaker 2>instance or just like basically saying</v>

2387
01:44:37.011 --> 01:44:37.580
<v Speaker 2>that women's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2388
01:44:37.580 --> 01:44:39.260
<v Speaker 2>an uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lunatic.</v>

2389
01:44:39.290 --> 01:44:41.090
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard people though enforce it and</v>

2390
01:44:41.091 --> 01:44:44.810
<v Speaker 2>I know someone who was mad at their</v>
<v Speaker 2>friend is a black girls matter.</v>

2391
01:44:44.811 --> 01:44:47.450
<v Speaker 2>Her friend who was a white girl who had</v>
<v Speaker 2>braids,</v>

2392
01:44:47.870 --> 01:44:50.720
<v Speaker 2>she had like cornrows and she was mad</v>
<v Speaker 2>because she was saying that it's</v>

2393
01:44:50.721 --> 01:44:52.820
<v Speaker 2>cultural appropriate cultural</v>
<v Speaker 2>appropriation.</v>

2394
01:44:52.821 --> 01:44:54.260
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you know about bo?</v>

2395
01:44:54.261 --> 01:44:56.990
<v Speaker 2>Derek?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like she was one of the first people</v>

2396
01:44:56.991 --> 01:45:00.260
<v Speaker 2>to ever have cornrows on roman coins</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually.</v>

2397
01:45:00.261 --> 01:45:01.094
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

2398
01:45:01.150 --> 01:45:03.350
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy thing to call that cultural</v>
<v Speaker 2>appropriation,</v>

2399
01:45:03.351 --> 01:45:07.430
<v Speaker 2>but also saying that a white person</v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't wear that.</v>

2400
01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:09.800
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking crazy because what do</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

2401
01:45:09.830 --> 01:45:11.720
<v Speaker 2>What about a black guy wearing a polo</v>
<v Speaker 2>shirt?</v>

2402
01:45:11.930 --> 01:45:12.321
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2403
01:45:12.321 --> 01:45:12.910
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2404
01:45:12.910 --> 01:45:16.730
<v Speaker 2>There was a good example is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>

2405
01:45:16.731 --> 01:45:18.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm not like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not the greatest advocate for this</v>

2406
01:45:18.951 --> 01:45:21.440
<v Speaker 2>position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just read so much that made me</v>

2407
01:45:21.500 --> 01:45:24.200
<v Speaker 2>empathize with the position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not necessarily agree with it,</v>

2408
01:45:24.201 --> 01:45:25.700
<v Speaker 2>but empathize with where it's coming</v>
<v Speaker 2>from.</v>

2409
01:45:25.880 --> 01:45:29.360
<v Speaker 2>So the polo for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you see you as a white dude or me</v>

2410
01:45:29.361 --> 01:45:31.490
<v Speaker 2>as a white dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I see somebody wearing a polo,</v>

2411
01:45:31.670 --> 01:45:34.600
<v Speaker 2>it's just a polo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has no historical antecedent,</v>

2412
01:45:34.601 --> 01:45:39.601
<v Speaker 2>it has no historical baggage to it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no connection to systemic racism</v>

2413
01:45:40.161 --> 01:45:42.320
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or elvis presley stealing the cream of</v>

2414
01:45:42.321 --> 01:45:46.070
<v Speaker 2>the intellectual musical crop and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>never giving back to that community or</v>

2415
01:45:46.370 --> 01:45:49.070
<v Speaker 2>iggy azalea coming in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>adopting a black accent and then just</v>

2416
01:45:49.071 --> 01:45:50.750
<v Speaker 2>like taking all the money and running,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2417
01:45:50.930 --> 01:45:54.450
<v Speaker 2>it has no connection to deeper root</v>
<v Speaker 2>systems like these trees have the</v>

2418
01:45:54.451 --> 01:45:56.720
<v Speaker 2>communicate with each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like taste bitter,</v>

2419
01:45:56.870 --> 01:45:59.120
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all it is is a polo.</v>

2420
01:45:59.121 --> 01:46:02.300
<v Speaker 2>It's just a guy wearing a polo and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why the the counterargument</v>

2421
01:46:02.301 --> 01:46:05.930
<v Speaker 2>doesn't make sense because it's like</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody's upset when they see a black</v>

2422
01:46:05.931 --> 01:46:09.330
<v Speaker 2>dude and a polo shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe some weird racist guy is</v>

2423
01:46:09.350 --> 01:46:10.430
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but mostly not.</v>

2424
01:46:11.060 --> 01:46:14.960
<v Speaker 2>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when a person sees a,</v>

2425
01:46:15.080 --> 01:46:18.890
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a white person affecting a deep part of</v>

2426
01:46:18.891 --> 01:46:23.260
<v Speaker 2>black culture without any of the baggage</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is associated with it.</v>

2427
01:46:23.261 --> 01:46:24.350
<v Speaker 2>Like for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dreads,</v>

2428
01:46:24.351 --> 01:46:26.630
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the arguments I read a lot is</v>

2429
01:46:26.631 --> 01:46:29.180
<v Speaker 2>that like white people wearing braids</v>
<v Speaker 2>and dreads,</v>

2430
01:46:29.450 --> 01:46:31.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get rewarded for it,</v>

2431
01:46:31.071 --> 01:46:34.310
<v Speaker 2>you look cool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look awesome and meanwhile black</v>

2432
01:46:34.311 --> 01:46:37.100
<v Speaker 2>women are having a difficult time</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting a job because they have black</v>

2433
01:46:37.101 --> 01:46:40.760
<v Speaker 2>hair or black people getting fired from</v>
<v Speaker 2>jobs because they have dreads.</v>

2434
01:46:40.910 --> 01:46:43.340
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's these consequences that black</v>

2435
01:46:43.341 --> 01:46:46.730
<v Speaker 2>people experience because of black shit</v>
<v Speaker 2>that white people that are adopting it</v>

2436
01:46:46.850 --> 01:46:48.920
<v Speaker 2>don't necessarily experience think</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's true at all.</v>

2437
01:46:48.921 --> 01:46:49.980
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you were working in</v>

2438
01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:54.240
<v Speaker 5>an office and some white dude at dreads,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he'd be highly suspicious of his</v>

2439
01:46:54.241 --> 01:46:54.810
<v Speaker 5>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2440
01:46:54.810 --> 01:46:57.510
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like is this guy's kind of like a dork?</v>

2441
01:46:57.511 --> 01:46:59.040
<v Speaker 5>I hear what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to hire him.</v>

2442
01:46:59.400 --> 01:47:02.850
<v Speaker 5>There's a guy that had hair like you and</v>
<v Speaker 5>right next to him with some stinky white</v>

2443
01:47:02.851 --> 01:47:04.650
<v Speaker 5>dude with them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Stinky dreads has dreads.</v>

2444
01:47:04.651 --> 01:47:05.550
<v Speaker 5>Stink.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2445
01:47:05.560 --> 01:47:07.760
<v Speaker 5>Take dreads out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's say that's a good example.</v>

2446
01:47:08.290 --> 01:47:10.870
<v Speaker 5>Would there in the us military,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was just a,</v>

2447
01:47:10.950 --> 01:47:12.630
<v Speaker 5>a new,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2448
01:47:12.900 --> 01:47:17.010
<v Speaker 5>a new set of acceptable hairstyles and</v>
<v Speaker 5>mo,</v>

2449
01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:20.100
<v Speaker 5>almost every one of the unacceptable</v>
<v Speaker 5>hairstyles that they,</v>

2450
01:47:20.160 --> 01:47:22.170
<v Speaker 5>that they accept,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that they put into place.</v>

2451
01:47:22.420 --> 01:47:26.670
<v Speaker 5>It was basically black hair,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like braids,</v>

2452
01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:30.420
<v Speaker 5>wearing your hair natural.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know the actuaL.</v>

2453
01:47:30.450 --> 01:47:31.050
<v Speaker 5>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2454
01:47:31.050 --> 01:47:33.180
<v Speaker 5>I would have to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we'd have to be like an afro.</v>

2455
01:47:33.560 --> 01:47:35.790
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Short afro.</v>

2456
01:47:35.810 --> 01:47:36.450
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2457
01:47:36.450 --> 01:47:37.410
<v Speaker 5>you're not allowed to do that.</v>

2458
01:47:37.860 --> 01:47:40.620
<v Speaker 5>You'd have to pull up the article to</v>
<v Speaker 5>give these specific examples.</v>

2459
01:47:40.621 --> 01:47:43.800
<v Speaker 5>But basically there are a million</v>
<v Speaker 5>different examples like that.</v>

2460
01:47:43.801 --> 01:47:44.880
<v Speaker 5>And like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not,</v>

2461
01:47:45.180 --> 01:47:48.180
<v Speaker 5>I'm not necessarily an advocate for heat</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

2462
01:47:48.330 --> 01:47:52.350
<v Speaker 5>and honor the call of the appropriation</v>
<v Speaker 5>accuser.</v>

2463
01:47:52.680 --> 01:47:55.860
<v Speaker 5>I'm more like now realizing that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2464
01:47:56.010 --> 01:47:59.700
<v Speaker 5>I'm more now realizing that there's like</v>
<v Speaker 5>just a lot of deep emotional,</v>

2465
01:47:59.880 --> 01:48:04.140
<v Speaker 5>weird trauma underneath every,</v>
<v Speaker 5>every accusation of appropriation.</v>

2466
01:48:04.410 --> 01:48:07.980
<v Speaker 5>It's not that I think therefore white</v>
<v Speaker 5>girls shouldn't wear braids.</v>

2467
01:48:07.981 --> 01:48:12.981
<v Speaker 5>It's that I think I understand more</v>
<v Speaker 5>where the person that is upset is coming</v>

2468
01:48:13.081 --> 01:48:15.600
<v Speaker 5>from it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just from a compassion perspective.</v>

2469
01:48:16.580 --> 01:48:17.790
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get that.</v>

2470
01:48:17.970 --> 01:48:19.950
<v Speaker 5>I get that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It just logically,</v>

2471
01:48:20.190 --> 01:48:22.170
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't jive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not about logic.</v>

2472
01:48:22.260 --> 01:48:24.270
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it should be all human interaction</v>

2473
01:48:24.271 --> 01:48:26.940
<v Speaker 5>should have some basis in logic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you're going to communicate with</v>

2474
01:48:26.941 --> 01:48:28.770
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't agree because emotions aren't</v>

2475
01:48:28.771 --> 01:48:29.550
<v Speaker 5>about logic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2476
01:48:29.550 --> 01:48:33.320
<v Speaker 5>But should anybody be subject to your</v>
<v Speaker 5>oWn emotions like should like,</v>

2477
01:48:33.390 --> 01:48:35.700
<v Speaker 5>you change your behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your dress.</v>

2478
01:48:35.940 --> 01:48:39.420
<v Speaker 5>If you're a person who's completely not</v>
<v Speaker 5>racist but you enjoy the way your hair</v>

2479
01:48:39.421 --> 01:48:42.870
<v Speaker 5>looks and braids should you take into</v>
<v Speaker 5>consideration all the people that you're</v>

2480
01:48:42.871 --> 01:48:45.810
<v Speaker 5>going to run into and they're going to</v>
<v Speaker 5>be upset at you over braids,</v>

2481
01:48:45.811 --> 01:48:48.920
<v Speaker 5>even though they're ignorant about the</v>
<v Speaker 5>history of braids and carneros,</v>

2482
01:48:49.200 --> 01:48:51.720
<v Speaker 5>should you alter or change your</v>
<v Speaker 5>behavior?</v>

2483
01:48:51.870 --> 01:48:54.690
<v Speaker 5>Should you accept the fact that you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>just going to have a certain amount of</v>

2484
01:48:54.691 --> 01:48:55.890
<v Speaker 5>cultural appropriation?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2485
01:48:55.891 --> 01:48:57.990
<v Speaker 5>let me ask you this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if you.</v>

2486
01:48:58.050 --> 01:49:00.340
<v Speaker 5>I don't have an answer to that question.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think so.</v>

2487
01:49:00.430 --> 01:49:02.340
<v Speaker 5>That is an important part of this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2488
01:49:02.341 --> 01:49:04.830
<v Speaker 5>if you're going to accept the fact</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's some sort of an emotional</v>

2489
01:49:04.831 --> 01:49:07.110
<v Speaker 5>attachment to these things and that's</v>
<v Speaker 5>where the argument comes from.</v>

2490
01:49:07.560 --> 01:49:11.830
<v Speaker 5>Shouldn't you decide or at least</v>
<v Speaker 5>contemplate whether or not that emotion</v>

2491
01:49:11.831 --> 01:49:12.664
<v Speaker 5>is valid?</v>

2492
01:49:12.750 --> 01:49:15.810
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't seem to be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Seems to me there's real examples of</v>

2493
01:49:15.811 --> 01:49:18.140
<v Speaker 5>racism and horrible things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if you want to,</v>

2494
01:49:18.390 --> 01:49:21.300
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>make your eyes squinty and look like a</v>

2495
01:49:21.330 --> 01:49:24.420
<v Speaker 5>japanese character from a bugs bunny</v>
<v Speaker 5>cartoon in,</v>

2496
01:49:24.600 --> 01:49:27.720
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>1940 and then you want to go to a party</v>

2497
01:49:27.721 --> 01:49:30.000
<v Speaker 5>and people think you're a racist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You should,</v>

2498
01:49:30.090 --> 01:49:34.590
<v Speaker 5>you should be aware that you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>presenting an image that is inherently</v>

2499
01:49:34.591 --> 01:49:35.221
<v Speaker 5>racist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

2500
01:49:35.221 --> 01:49:37.470
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's something that's kind of fucked</v>

2501
01:49:37.471 --> 01:49:41.370
<v Speaker 5>up and you should be considered about</v>
<v Speaker 5>the way people's emotions are going to</v>

2502
01:49:41.640 --> 01:49:44.310
<v Speaker 5>fire up looking at your image.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what I'm saying.</v>

2503
01:49:44.820 --> 01:49:46.180
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's a different thing than</v>

2504
01:49:46.290 --> 01:49:47.710
<v Speaker 5>braids.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2505
01:49:47.711 --> 01:49:49.160
<v Speaker 5>but oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's what I'm.</v>

2506
01:49:49.280 --> 01:49:51.040
<v Speaker 5>I'm not advocating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>

2507
01:49:51.041 --> 01:49:53.800
<v Speaker 5>I'm not advocating anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just saying I've done.</v>

2508
01:49:53.830 --> 01:49:58.510
<v Speaker 5>I've delved into this topic enough that</v>
<v Speaker 5>I started to understand where people are</v>

2509
01:49:58.511 --> 01:50:01.180
<v Speaker 5>coming from when they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when they get activated by this stuff</v>

2510
01:50:01.370 --> 01:50:02.860
<v Speaker 5>too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think a big part of it is</v>

2511
01:50:02.870 --> 01:50:06.130
<v Speaker 5>reinforcement in the community that</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's acceptable to be upset at people</v>

2512
01:50:06.131 --> 01:50:07.810
<v Speaker 5>for corn rows or brave and I don't.</v>

2513
01:50:07.810 --> 01:50:10.750
<v Speaker 5>I actually don't disagree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think you're right about that and yet</v>

2514
01:50:10.751 --> 01:50:15.751
<v Speaker 5>I think it also is connected to like a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a legitimate emotional reality that's</v>

2515
01:50:15.881 --> 01:50:17.320
<v Speaker 5>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like for example,</v>

2516
01:50:17.470 --> 01:50:18.400
<v Speaker 5>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the logic is,</v>

2517
01:50:18.490 --> 01:50:22.660
<v Speaker 5>is very important and I would say logic</v>
<v Speaker 5>is more important than emotion when it</v>

2518
01:50:22.661 --> 01:50:25.780
<v Speaker 5>comes to communication,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it doesn't because something is more</v>

2519
01:50:25.781 --> 01:50:27.760
<v Speaker 5>important,</v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't negate the,</v>

2520
01:50:27.850 --> 01:50:30.100
<v Speaker 5>the importance of the other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2521
01:50:30.101 --> 01:50:33.040
<v Speaker 5>it certainly doesn't solve the situation</v>
<v Speaker 5>just by clearly using the logic.</v>

2522
01:50:33.041 --> 01:50:35.500
<v Speaker 5>You mIght get a certain percentage of</v>
<v Speaker 5>the people that agree with you because</v>

2523
01:50:35.501 --> 01:50:37.870
<v Speaker 5>of logic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's more rare than it is common,</v>

2524
01:50:37.871 --> 01:50:38.620
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

2525
01:50:38.620 --> 01:50:41.530
<v Speaker 5>would you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Would You feel comfortable going to a</v>

2526
01:50:41.531 --> 01:50:44.260
<v Speaker 5>native american powwow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2527
01:50:44.261 --> 01:50:45.850
<v Speaker 5>with a headdress on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not even a power.</v>

2528
01:50:45.851 --> 01:50:48.340
<v Speaker 5>There's a powwow next door.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can see It and you're at a music</v>

2529
01:50:48.341 --> 01:50:48.940
<v Speaker 5>festival.</v>

2530
01:50:48.940 --> 01:50:50.680
<v Speaker 5>Would you were an indian headdress?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't,</v>

2531
01:50:50.681 --> 01:50:54.220
<v Speaker 5>but the reason why you can't and the</v>
<v Speaker 5>reason why you shouldn't or the reason</v>

2532
01:50:54.221 --> 01:50:56.470
<v Speaker 5>why it's an issue is because the people</v>
<v Speaker 5>are marginalized.</v>

2533
01:50:56.471 --> 01:50:59.680
<v Speaker 5>Let me tAke my own people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm italian and my people,</v>

2534
01:51:00.070 --> 01:51:03.050
<v Speaker 5>for the longest time there was a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 5>anti italian races.</v>

2535
01:51:03.070 --> 01:51:06.100
<v Speaker 5>My grandfather talked to me about it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what it was like coming off the boat,</v>

2536
01:51:06.370 --> 01:51:11.070
<v Speaker 5>but then somewhere along the line it</v>
<v Speaker 5>became acceptable for italians in,</v>

2537
01:51:11.120 --> 01:51:14.410
<v Speaker 5>in american culture where it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no real racism.</v>

2538
01:51:14.411 --> 01:51:18.940
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't stick and cause a Guinea to</v>
<v Speaker 5>our face.</v>

2539
01:51:18.970 --> 01:51:20.770
<v Speaker 5>We will laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No one cares.</v>

2540
01:51:21.010 --> 01:51:23.260
<v Speaker 5>You could make meatballs and spaghetti</v>
<v Speaker 5>all day long.</v>

2541
01:51:23.261 --> 01:51:25.750
<v Speaker 5>Nobody gives a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nobody accuses you of,</v>

2542
01:51:25.800 --> 01:51:26.620
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2543
01:51:26.620 --> 01:51:28.690
<v Speaker 5>you have a pizza party.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nobody thinks it's cultural</v>

2544
01:51:28.691 --> 01:51:30.880
<v Speaker 5>appropriation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but try having a taco party,</v>

2545
01:51:30.881 --> 01:51:33.340
<v Speaker 5>try having taco tuesdays people get</v>
<v Speaker 5>pissed to you.</v>

2546
01:51:33.340 --> 01:51:35.890
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because mexicans still experienced real</v>

2547
01:51:35.891 --> 01:51:38.680
<v Speaker 5>racism in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whereas italians largely just don't,</v>

2548
01:51:38.710 --> 01:51:40.750
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>and like taco tuesdays and example of</v>

2549
01:51:40.751 --> 01:51:42.310
<v Speaker 5>something that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who fucking cares,</v>

2550
01:51:42.311 --> 01:51:43.620
<v Speaker 5>that's not important.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

2551
01:51:43.920 --> 01:51:48.010
<v Speaker 5>and so if I'm wearing a sombrero,</v>
<v Speaker 5>exactly offensive to people,</v>

2552
01:51:48.070 --> 01:51:50.560
<v Speaker 5>If that's as,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's as deep as most people go,</v>

2553
01:51:51.250 --> 01:51:52.510
<v Speaker 5>that's dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What are you talking about?</v>

2554
01:51:52.511 --> 01:51:54.940
<v Speaker 5>A kennedy to taco.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's done and it is dumb,</v>

2555
01:51:55.240 --> 01:51:58.200
<v Speaker 5>but if you kinda like get under the dme,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is the name of my,</v>

2556
01:51:58.320 --> 01:52:00.280
<v Speaker 5>my third,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my third special.</v>

2557
01:52:00.281 --> 01:52:02.220
<v Speaker 5>So it's mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's live,</v>

2558
01:52:02.290 --> 01:52:05.410
<v Speaker 5>live in oakland now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking hitler and then get under the</v>

2559
01:52:05.411 --> 01:52:07.390
<v Speaker 5>dme.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But if you get under the first,</v>

2560
01:52:07.410 --> 01:52:10.150
<v Speaker 5>like the most,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the epidermal layer of like flashy</v>

2561
01:52:10.151 --> 01:52:13.240
<v Speaker 5>insanity and go like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's really happening here is like,</v>

2562
01:52:13.300 --> 01:52:14.740
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just what you're saying actually</v>

2563
01:52:14.741 --> 01:52:17.080
<v Speaker 5>you're more woke than you than you let</v>
<v Speaker 5>on june interest.</v>

2564
01:52:17.081 --> 01:52:19.330
<v Speaker 5>It's like it's really about power</v>
<v Speaker 5>dynamics.</v>

2565
01:52:19.331 --> 01:52:21.430
<v Speaker 5>Is that really about the appropriation</v>
<v Speaker 5>incident?</v>

2566
01:52:21.760 --> 01:52:24.910
<v Speaker 5>Although on some level maybe it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's really about the power dynamic</v>

2567
01:52:24.911 --> 01:52:25.870
<v Speaker 5>underneath it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2568
01:52:25.871 --> 01:52:28.930
<v Speaker 5>I think one of the things that we're</v>
<v Speaker 5>seeing in universities in particular is</v>

2569
01:52:28.931 --> 01:52:33.820
<v Speaker 5>people that are exercising the ability</v>
<v Speaker 5>to affect change.</v>

2570
01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:37.540
<v Speaker 5>Even if it doesn't make sense,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have the ability to,</v>

2571
01:52:37.580 --> 01:52:39.910
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>point out something that they think is</v>

2572
01:52:40.180 --> 01:52:44.560
<v Speaker 5>incorrect or is unjust and then they</v>
<v Speaker 5>attack it and go after it and then they</v>

2573
01:52:44.561 --> 01:52:46.190
<v Speaker 5>see and by seeing</v>

2574
01:52:46.190 --> 01:52:49.340
<v Speaker 3>those results,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's almost in a lot of ways kind of</v>

2575
01:52:49.341 --> 01:52:52.490
<v Speaker 3>attached to the same idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you're worth x amount of</v>

2576
01:52:52.491 --> 01:52:53.930
<v Speaker 3>dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why do you still chase money?</v>

2577
01:52:54.050 --> 01:52:57.200
<v Speaker 3>Because you're trying to get the thrill</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the accomplishment.</v>

2578
01:52:57.230 --> 01:52:59.960
<v Speaker 3>There's the game that's going on and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a certain amount of game going</v>

2579
01:52:59.961 --> 01:53:03.620
<v Speaker 3>on trying to get that white kid that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't even know to cut off his dreads.</v>

2580
01:53:03.770 --> 01:53:05.900
<v Speaker 3>Whether or not you know that the romans</v>
<v Speaker 3>wore dreads,</v>

2581
01:53:05.901 --> 01:53:06.531
<v Speaker 3>whether or not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2582
01:53:06.531 --> 01:53:09.290
<v Speaker 3>the greeks wore dreads,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the vikings and all these different</v>

2583
01:53:09.291 --> 01:53:11.120
<v Speaker 3>people have them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter.</v>

2584
01:53:11.240 --> 01:53:14.240
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's a little tiny white</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy and that girl could yell at that</v>

2585
01:53:14.241 --> 01:53:16.010
<v Speaker 3>white guy then chase him with a pair of</v>
<v Speaker 3>scissors.</v>

2586
01:53:16.360 --> 01:53:17.141
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

2587
01:53:17.141 --> 01:53:19.810
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the incidence are the absurdity.</v>

2588
01:53:19.930 --> 01:53:21.520
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the current,</v>

2589
01:53:21.550 --> 01:53:24.190
<v Speaker 2>the conceptual current is somewhat</v>
<v Speaker 2>valid.</v>

2590
01:53:24.200 --> 01:53:25.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to you,</v>

2591
01:53:25.520 --> 01:53:26.353
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2592
01:53:26.580 --> 01:53:29.470
<v Speaker 2>to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like even you and I think that you're</v>

2593
01:53:29.500 --> 01:53:32.470
<v Speaker 2>naturally skeptical towards concepts</v>
<v Speaker 2>like cultural appropriation because,</v>

2594
01:53:32.520 --> 01:53:34.840
<v Speaker 2>and I am too because as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially as comedians,</v>

2595
01:53:35.200 --> 01:53:38.250
<v Speaker 2>it's very easy to see the absurdity and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's stupid and it's so,</v>

2596
01:53:38.280 --> 01:53:40.300
<v Speaker 2>it's so pointless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>

2597
01:53:40.750 --> 01:53:43.960
<v Speaker 2>We can't not adopt each other's cultures</v>
<v Speaker 2>that won't ever happen.</v>

2598
01:53:44.200 --> 01:53:46.120
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but even we go,</v>

2599
01:53:46.180 --> 01:53:49.180
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I wouldn't wear a sombrero to a</v>

2600
01:53:49.181 --> 01:53:51.790
<v Speaker 2>mexican club.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't walk into a club like,</v>

2601
01:53:51.791 --> 01:53:52.211
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2602
01:53:52.211 --> 01:53:53.050
<v Speaker 2>what's up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2603
01:53:53.080 --> 01:53:54.310
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you say,</v>

2604
01:53:54.311 --> 01:53:56.170
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost pornography,</v>

2605
01:53:56.171 --> 01:53:57.340
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it when I see it.</v>

2606
01:53:57.430 --> 01:53:59.230
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know when I know it's offensive when I</v>

2607
01:53:59.231 --> 01:54:00.064
<v Speaker 2>feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2608
01:54:00.070 --> 01:54:03.250
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you kind of expand further and go,</v>

2609
01:54:03.251 --> 01:54:05.050
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even the absurd examples,</v>

2610
01:54:05.051 --> 01:54:07.960
<v Speaker 2>I kind of understood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to try to understand for me,</v>

2611
01:54:08.200 --> 01:54:10.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to try to understand where</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are coming from with that.</v>

2612
01:54:10.870 --> 01:54:14.140
<v Speaker 2>Then I can kind of contextualize it now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to agree with it,</v>

2613
01:54:14.141 --> 01:54:15.490
<v Speaker 2>but I can at least say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2614
01:54:15.491 --> 01:54:19.300
<v Speaker 2>I get where this is coming from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's coming from historical antecedents</v>

2615
01:54:19.301 --> 01:54:22.180
<v Speaker 2>of racism and oppression that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>connected to hairstyle and,</v>

2616
01:54:22.390 --> 01:54:23.260
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2617
01:54:23.261 --> 01:54:24.094
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2618
01:54:24.190 --> 01:54:27.790
<v Speaker 2>all of these musicians that have taken</v>
<v Speaker 2>black culture and made money off of it.</v>

2619
01:54:27.791 --> 01:54:32.260
<v Speaker 2>There's all this like deeper sedimentary</v>
<v Speaker 2>layers of emotionality.</v>

2620
01:54:32.560 --> 01:54:34.960
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to heat it and change</v>
<v Speaker 2>accordingly,</v>

2621
01:54:34.961 --> 01:54:37.210
<v Speaker 2>but I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would be foolish to ignore it.</v>

2622
01:54:37.260 --> 01:54:38.060
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2623
01:54:38.060 --> 01:54:39.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that completely makes sense.</v>

2624
01:54:39.711 --> 01:54:44.030
<v Speaker 3>And also I get it from a point of view</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a person who comes from a culture</v>

2625
01:54:44.031 --> 01:54:46.550
<v Speaker 3>that used to be maligned and isn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

2626
01:54:46.910 --> 01:54:47.680
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

2627
01:54:47.680 --> 01:54:50.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm from a culture that used to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>maligned and then I thought wasn't</v>

2628
01:54:50.441 --> 01:54:52.210
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then very recently things have</v>

2629
01:54:52.211 --> 01:54:53.044
<v Speaker 2>gotten weird again.</v>

2630
01:54:53.730 --> 01:54:57.720
<v Speaker 3>It's really easy to say that jews are</v>
<v Speaker 3>responsible for a large problem.</v>

2631
01:54:57.930 --> 01:55:00.950
<v Speaker 3>Part of the problem in the world today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen it a lot lately.</v>

2632
01:55:00.970 --> 01:55:05.460
<v Speaker 3>It used to be like reAlly inappropriate</v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking and talking just 20 years ago</v>

2633
01:55:05.461 --> 01:55:05.500
<v Speaker 3>ago,</v>

2634
01:55:05.500 --> 01:55:07.960
<v Speaker 2>it used to be very taboo and it is not</v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

2635
01:55:08.380 --> 01:55:10.120
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's uh,</v>

2636
01:55:10.210 --> 01:55:11.230
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's weird.</v>

2637
01:55:11.231 --> 01:55:12.280
<v Speaker 2>It's very weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely,</v>

2638
01:55:12.281 --> 01:55:13.360
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2639
01:55:13.361 --> 01:55:18.361
<v Speaker 2>I don't take stuff antisemitism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Antisemitism is like the closest I come</v>

2640
01:55:18.731 --> 01:55:23.731
<v Speaker 2>to believing in magic because it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like I'm not a big mystical guy,</v>

2641
01:55:24.581 --> 01:55:27.940
<v Speaker 2>but like antisemitism has never gone</v>
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>

2642
01:55:28.330 --> 01:55:31.030
<v Speaker 2>It just has an eye.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could see if you're an anti semite</v>

2643
01:55:31.060 --> 01:55:33.970
<v Speaker 2>you're going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The evil of the jews is the closest I</v>

2644
01:55:33.971 --> 01:55:36.670
<v Speaker 2>come to believing in magic because they</v>
<v Speaker 2>just never stopped being evil.</v>

2645
01:55:36.671 --> 01:55:39.460
<v Speaker 2>Like I just don't understand how this</v>
<v Speaker 2>never goes away.</v>

2646
01:55:39.580 --> 01:55:43.210
<v Speaker 2>It never goes away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so fucking weird.</v>

2647
01:55:43.650 --> 01:55:47.940
<v Speaker 2>Like no matter where jews have lived,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no matter how assimilated they've been,</v>

2648
01:55:48.030 --> 01:55:51.060
<v Speaker 2>you know that the jews in berlin where</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most assimilated jews in history,</v>

2649
01:55:51.200 --> 01:55:51.731
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2650
01:55:51.731 --> 01:55:54.360
<v Speaker 2>they didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were known for having christmas</v>

2651
01:55:54.361 --> 01:55:57.890
<v Speaker 2>trees and eating pork and that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>would describe these christmas parties</v>

2652
01:55:57.900 --> 01:56:00.510
<v Speaker 2>were only be jews because the germans</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't go,</v>

2653
01:56:00.511 --> 01:56:03.600
<v Speaker 2>but it would be all of them worshiping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean a celebrated christmas.</v>

2654
01:56:03.840 --> 01:56:05.370
<v Speaker 2>They were the most assimilated jews</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>

2655
01:56:05.371 --> 01:56:07.830
<v Speaker 2>And that was the epicenter of the nazi</v>
<v Speaker 2>movement.</v>

2656
01:56:08.010 --> 01:56:11.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it follows the jews and I mean,</v>

2657
01:56:11.041 --> 01:56:13.470
<v Speaker 2>I know that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure at least one of your listeners</v>

2658
01:56:13.471 --> 01:56:14.790
<v Speaker 2>is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2659
01:56:14.850 --> 01:56:16.740
<v Speaker 2>the jews follow it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like,</v>

2660
01:56:17.190 --> 01:56:19.200
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just won't go away.</v>

2661
01:56:19.320 --> 01:56:20.250
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

2662
01:56:20.251 --> 01:56:22.800
<v Speaker 2>it's a virus that won't ever ever die</v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

2663
01:56:23.670 --> 01:56:24.010
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2664
01:56:24.010 --> 01:56:29.010
<v Speaker 3>I think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a bunch of problems with this</v>

2665
01:56:29.951 --> 01:56:32.140
<v Speaker 3>antisemitic thing going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2666
01:56:32.320 --> 01:56:37.210
<v Speaker 3>and one of them is the accomplishments</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the jews are very disproportionate,</v>

2667
01:56:37.420 --> 01:56:40.960
<v Speaker 3>especially european jews.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you look at european jews and nobel</v>

2668
01:56:40.961 --> 01:56:44.230
<v Speaker 3>prize winners,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fucking staggering saying jews who</v>

2669
01:56:44.231 --> 01:56:45.910
<v Speaker 3>were intellectuals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chess champions,</v>

2670
01:56:46.200 --> 01:56:49.090
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is a select gene pool,</v>

2671
01:56:49.430 --> 01:56:54.430
<v Speaker 3>especially particularly european jews.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody talks about it that I don't think</v>

2672
01:56:54.821 --> 01:56:55.780
<v Speaker 3>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2673
01:56:56.370 --> 01:56:59.340
<v Speaker 3>true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was a no.</v>

2674
01:56:59.440 --> 01:57:00.460
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2675
01:57:00.910 --> 01:57:03.250
<v Speaker 3>Giant people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So everyone's probably a huge hogs.</v>

2676
01:57:04.130 --> 01:57:06.400
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but do you know the story of fritz</v>

2677
01:57:06.401 --> 01:57:10.300
<v Speaker 3>haber?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fritz harbor's one of the most shocking</v>

2678
01:57:10.390 --> 01:57:13.740
<v Speaker 3>a jewish stories in terms of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

2679
01:57:13.750 --> 01:57:17.950
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a jewish scientist who was a part of</v>

2680
01:57:17.951 --> 01:57:20.650
<v Speaker 3>world war one on the side of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>germans.</v>

2681
01:57:20.830 --> 01:57:24.160
<v Speaker 3>He aLso invented the hopper method of</v>
<v Speaker 3>extracting nitrogen from the</v>

2682
01:57:24.161 --> 01:57:25.750
<v Speaker 3>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2683
01:57:26.020 --> 01:57:28.890
<v Speaker 3>nitrogen Is one of the most important</v>
<v Speaker 3>things when it comes to fertilizer.</v>

2684
01:57:28.890 --> 01:57:33.700
<v Speaker 3>We were talking about fertilizer plans</v>
<v Speaker 3>and nitrogen is 80 percent of the air we</v>

2685
01:57:33.701 --> 01:57:36.190
<v Speaker 3>breathe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most people think the air is oxygen and</v>

2686
01:57:36.191 --> 01:57:38.320
<v Speaker 3>carbon dioxide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's mostly nitrogen.</v>

2687
01:57:38.650 --> 01:57:42.310
<v Speaker 3>And then there's some oxygen and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some carbon dioxide we breathe</v>

2688
01:57:42.311 --> 01:57:46.000
<v Speaker 3>out that that plants use.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fritz harbor figured out a way to</v>

2689
01:57:46.001 --> 01:57:51.001
<v Speaker 3>extract nitrogen from the acts of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>actual oxygen from the actual air around</v>

2690
01:57:52.031 --> 01:57:56.920
<v Speaker 3>us and take that nitrogen and use it in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the soil as fertilizer.</v>

2691
01:57:58.030 --> 01:58:03.030
<v Speaker 3>And he won a nobel prize for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And 50 percent of the nitrogen in most</v>

2692
01:58:04.421 --> 01:58:08.270
<v Speaker 3>people's bodies came from the harbor</v>
<v Speaker 3>method like his.</v>

2693
01:58:08.530 --> 01:58:10.840
<v Speaker 3>This is like from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2694
01:58:10.841 --> 01:58:13.190
<v Speaker 3>the early 19 hundreds of sky figured</v>
<v Speaker 3>this out.</v>

2695
01:58:13.220 --> 01:58:17.830
<v Speaker 3>It's still being used today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He also was the first guy to invent</v>

2696
01:58:17.831 --> 01:58:21.880
<v Speaker 3>using poison gas and they use it on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>allied troops in world war one.</v>

2697
01:58:22.030 --> 01:58:25.870
<v Speaker 3>So he was wanted for crimes against</v>
<v Speaker 3>humanity and simultaneously winning the</v>

2698
01:58:25.871 --> 01:58:27.970
<v Speaker 3>nobel prize during world war one.</v>

2699
01:58:28.480 --> 01:58:31.240
<v Speaker 3>And then when the nazis took over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

2700
01:58:31.241 --> 01:58:33.580
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he created zyklon,</v>

2701
01:58:33.640 --> 01:58:36.760
<v Speaker 3>a client a is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2702
01:58:37.210 --> 01:58:40.240
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a gas that has a very distinct</v>

2703
01:58:40.241 --> 01:58:45.010
<v Speaker 3>smell and I think it was a pesticide and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they used a,</v>

2704
01:58:45.770 --> 01:58:50.470
<v Speaker 3>the smell was added to it to make people</v>
<v Speaker 3>acutely aware that this pesticide was</v>

2705
01:58:50.471 --> 01:58:54.290
<v Speaker 3>being used because it was very poisonous</v>
<v Speaker 3>they changed it to be,</v>

2706
01:58:54.400 --> 01:58:56.110
<v Speaker 3>which is they use the gas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the jews.</v>

2707
01:58:56.380 --> 01:59:01.380
<v Speaker 3>So this fucking guy created the actual</v>
<v Speaker 3>gas that was used in the fucking</v>

2708
01:59:03.160 --> 01:59:08.160
<v Speaker 3>concentration camps to kill the jews and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just took the smell out of it.</v>

2709
01:59:08.800 --> 01:59:11.610
<v Speaker 3>That's how they created zyklon b,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever that thing was,</v>

2710
01:59:11.630 --> 01:59:13.960
<v Speaker 3>they added to icon a to make it smell</v>
<v Speaker 3>bad.</v>

2711
01:59:14.170 --> 01:59:17.470
<v Speaker 3>They took that out for his icon based.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was almost odorless and they were</v>

2712
01:59:17.471 --> 01:59:21.040
<v Speaker 3>killing people left and right with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was forced out of the country.</v>

2713
01:59:21.430 --> 01:59:22.660
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a crazy,</v>

2714
01:59:22.661 --> 01:59:24.640
<v Speaker 3>crazy story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2715
01:59:24.730 --> 01:59:26.840
<v Speaker 3>when he was going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2716
01:59:26.950 --> 01:59:30.160
<v Speaker 3>the front line to help implement his</v>
<v Speaker 3>gas,</v>

2717
01:59:30.510 --> 01:59:31.300
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

2718
01:59:31.300 --> 01:59:34.360
<v Speaker 3>on the allied troops,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his wife shot herself in front of him</v>

2719
01:59:34.960 --> 01:59:38.770
<v Speaker 3>and he left his kid behind with his</v>
<v Speaker 3>dying wife to go to war.</v>

2720
01:59:39.700 --> 01:59:41.560
<v Speaker 3>it's fucking crazy stories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Crazy.</v>

2721
01:59:41.561 --> 01:59:45.280
<v Speaker 3>And he wound up dying seeking refuge</v>
<v Speaker 3>away from Germany.</v>

2722
01:59:45.400 --> 01:59:49.210
<v Speaker 3>He was one of the few scientists that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't want a few jews.</v>

2723
01:59:49.211 --> 01:59:53.440
<v Speaker 3>They didn't lock up and he just couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>tolerate.</v>

2724
01:59:53.470 --> 01:59:57.970
<v Speaker 3>I mean he couldn't stand by while these</v>
<v Speaker 3>other jews that he knew were going to</v>

2725
01:59:57.971 --> 02:00:01.720
<v Speaker 3>the concentration camps and people were</v>
<v Speaker 3>being rounded up and he'd go leaving.</v>

2726
02:00:02.110 --> 02:00:03.810
<v Speaker 3>Did he know that cycle b?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2727
02:00:04.090 --> 02:00:07.330
<v Speaker 3>I think that might have happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like while he was,</v>

2728
02:00:07.480 --> 02:00:10.740
<v Speaker 3>while he was on the run.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not sure I'd have to get into that,</v>

2729
02:00:10.750 --> 02:00:13.000
<v Speaker 2>but I mean that would be a crazy</v>
<v Speaker 2>realization that,</v>

2730
02:00:13.060 --> 02:00:13.881
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2731
02:00:13.881 --> 02:00:15.860
<v Speaker 2>the t and t guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I either built dynamite,</v>

2732
02:00:15.861 --> 02:00:17.620
<v Speaker 2>like realizing what he'd done to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

2733
02:00:17.621 --> 02:00:18.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how about oppenheimer,</v>

2734
02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:19.990
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2735
02:00:20.160 --> 02:00:22.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean oppenheimer is quoting the</v>
<v Speaker 2>bhagavad gita.</v>

2736
02:00:22.700 --> 02:00:27.220
<v Speaker 2>We played that on the podcast last week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come the death destroyer of worlds.</v>

2737
02:00:27.430 --> 02:00:30.850
<v Speaker 2>Fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Speaking of billionaires,</v>

2738
02:00:30.851 --> 02:00:31.930
<v Speaker 2>being able,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2739
02:00:32.520 --> 02:00:36.220
<v Speaker 2>to have that quote is like that's a big</v>
<v Speaker 2>yikes moment.</v>

2740
02:00:36.280 --> 02:00:37.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2741
02:00:37.500 --> 02:00:39.550
<v Speaker 3>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's.</v>

2742
02:00:39.551 --> 02:00:44.551
<v Speaker 3>That is that jews have been so almost</v>
<v Speaker 3>genetically smart for so long.</v>

2743
02:00:45.300 --> 02:00:46.430
<v Speaker 2>There's a reason for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2744
02:00:46.770 --> 02:00:47.603
<v Speaker 2>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2745
02:00:47.820 --> 02:00:51.810
<v Speaker 2>it's that basically in the whole of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>dark ages,</v>

2746
02:00:51.840 --> 02:00:54.600
<v Speaker 2>the dark ages are characterized by</v>
<v Speaker 2>people being illiterate.</v>

2747
02:00:54.870 --> 02:00:58.140
<v Speaker 2>That's they were in the dark and only</v>
<v Speaker 2>the clergy could read that.</v>

2748
02:00:58.141 --> 02:01:03.141
<v Speaker 2>The jews were a 98 percent literate</v>
<v Speaker 2>people and that is literally the reason</v>

2749
02:01:05.310 --> 02:01:08.430
<v Speaker 2>if you want to talk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it actually comes all the way back to</v>

2750
02:01:08.431 --> 02:01:10.050
<v Speaker 2>systemic oppression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2751
02:01:10.190 --> 02:01:12.990
<v Speaker 2>In the same way that there are barriers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2752
02:01:12.991 --> 02:01:15.300
<v Speaker 2>if you're deaf or if you're black or if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a woman,</v>

2753
02:01:15.420 --> 02:01:18.480
<v Speaker 2>there are barriers you have to jump past</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you are given an advantage.</v>

2754
02:01:18.510 --> 02:01:19.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all evolution,</v>

2755
02:01:19.800 --> 02:01:21.990
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you're going to leap forward,</v>

2756
02:01:22.290 --> 02:01:26.700
<v Speaker 2>and so when you have a history of 500</v>
<v Speaker 2>years where no one in europe reads,</v>

2757
02:01:26.701 --> 02:01:29.130
<v Speaker 2>except for the jews and the clergy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2758
02:01:29.310 --> 02:01:30.750
<v Speaker 2>no shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they ended up,</v>

2759
02:01:30.830 --> 02:01:33.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being at the front lines of,</v>

2760
02:01:33.910 --> 02:01:35.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2761
02:01:35.330 --> 02:01:38.430
<v Speaker 2>of nobel prize winning and science and</v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectual ism,</v>

2762
02:01:38.431 --> 02:01:41.990
<v Speaker 2>not because they're obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but because they just were reading that</v>

2763
02:01:41.991 --> 02:01:42.824
<v Speaker 2>whole time.</v>

2764
02:01:42.990 --> 02:01:45.140
<v Speaker 2>And there'S a reason for the idea of</v>
<v Speaker 2>jewish greek too,</v>

2765
02:01:45.530 --> 02:01:46.041
<v Speaker 2>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2766
02:01:46.041 --> 02:01:47.540
<v Speaker 2>about this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that,</v>

2767
02:01:47.630 --> 02:01:50.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jesus said somethinG about usury.</v>

2768
02:01:50.930 --> 02:01:55.250
<v Speaker 2>Basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>catholics were not okay with a lending</v>

2769
02:01:55.251 --> 02:01:58.370
<v Speaker 2>money at interest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at an interest rate that was against the</v>

2770
02:01:58.371 --> 02:01:59.270
<v Speaker 2>rules,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2771
02:01:59.720 --> 02:02:00.860
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2772
02:02:00.890 --> 02:02:02.840
<v Speaker 2>so you're not going to lend people money</v>
<v Speaker 2>for no interest.</v>

2773
02:02:02.841 --> 02:02:05.870
<v Speaker 2>That's just not how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there were some people that</v>

2774
02:02:05.871 --> 02:02:09.590
<v Speaker 2>weren't subject to the rules of</v>
<v Speaker 2>christian anti usury laws and those were</v>

2775
02:02:09.591 --> 02:02:12.230
<v Speaker 2>the jews.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the jews would lend you money at</v>

2776
02:02:12.231 --> 02:02:14.990
<v Speaker 2>an interest rate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But who do you hate more than anybody on</v>

2777
02:02:14.991 --> 02:02:16.580
<v Speaker 2>earth?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who is the person you wish you were</v>

2778
02:02:16.581 --> 02:02:17.930
<v Speaker 2>dead?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your creditor.</v>

2779
02:02:18.260 --> 02:02:21.320
<v Speaker 2>You're the banker that is going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>foreclose on your home and is going to.</v>

2780
02:02:21.560 --> 02:02:24.230
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm not saying that's good or bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also hate the banker,</v>

2781
02:02:24.231 --> 02:02:27.490
<v Speaker 2>but that's just historically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they called jews moneylenders,</v>

2782
02:02:27.560 --> 02:02:29.420
<v Speaker 2>it's not because jews are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2783
02:02:29.421 --> 02:02:31.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm pernicious and I want to fill this</v>
<v Speaker 2>gap.</v>

2784
02:02:31.460 --> 02:02:34.940
<v Speaker 2>It's that nobody else in society would</v>
<v Speaker 2>lend people money.</v>

2785
02:02:34.941 --> 02:02:37.460
<v Speaker 2>And so not only were they the creditors</v>
<v Speaker 2>that people hate it,</v>

2786
02:02:37.670 --> 02:02:42.080
<v Speaker 2>but they were also the financier's that</v>
<v Speaker 2>made the possibility of european,</v>

2787
02:02:42.370 --> 02:02:45.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>greatness occur because without capital,</v>

2788
02:02:45.830 --> 02:02:47.960
<v Speaker 2>without funds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't build a society.</v>

2789
02:02:48.260 --> 02:02:49.410
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2790
02:02:49.430 --> 02:02:53.300
<v Speaker 2>that is one of the many reasons that</v>
<v Speaker 2>people have come to hate the jews,</v>

2791
02:02:53.301 --> 02:02:56.840
<v Speaker 2>is that they lent them the money and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they needed.</v>

2792
02:02:56.930 --> 02:02:58.640
<v Speaker 2>And then when it was time to come</v>
<v Speaker 2>collecting,</v>

2793
02:02:58.850 --> 02:03:00.440
<v Speaker 2>they'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck this dude.</v>

2794
02:03:00.800 --> 02:03:03.740
<v Speaker 2>So fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could find the root of certain</v>

2795
02:03:03.741 --> 02:03:05.600
<v Speaker 2>prejudices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

2796
02:03:06.470 --> 02:03:07.250
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

2797
02:03:07.250 --> 02:03:08.770
<v Speaker 2>That's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those,</v>

2798
02:03:08.771 --> 02:03:12.590
<v Speaker 2>those two are very good ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially the one about being literate.</v>

2799
02:03:12.830 --> 02:03:13.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

2800
02:03:13.671 --> 02:03:16.760
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that it wasn't until I was like</v>

2801
02:03:16.761 --> 02:03:21.761
<v Speaker 2>the 14 hundreds with martin luther that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they distorted translating the bible</v>

2802
02:03:22.161 --> 02:03:26.570
<v Speaker 2>into a phonetic alphabet where people</v>
<v Speaker 2>could read it and means stop and think</v>

2803
02:03:26.580 --> 02:03:27.260
<v Speaker 2>about that.</v>

2804
02:03:27.260 --> 02:03:31.400
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is what happened with martin luther,</v>

2805
02:03:32.090 --> 02:03:36.980
<v Speaker 2>the reformation and the printing press</v>
<v Speaker 2>with martin luther is the was the</v>

2806
02:03:36.981 --> 02:03:41.981
<v Speaker 2>cracking of the old guard of of society</v>
<v Speaker 2>and finally made demo democratization of</v>

2807
02:03:43.191 --> 02:03:47.210
<v Speaker 2>knowledge available to everybody and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know that everybody was at a</v>

2808
02:03:47.211 --> 02:03:51.260
<v Speaker 2>disadvantage of historical disadvantage</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the same thing as you can see that</v>

2809
02:03:51.320 --> 02:03:54.710
<v Speaker 2>truth in other systems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a system of oppression to.</v>

2810
02:03:54.820 --> 02:03:55.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

2811
02:03:55.300 --> 02:03:58.760
<v Speaker 2>That's a systemic oppression where the</v>
<v Speaker 2>clergy wanted to keep information from</v>

2812
02:03:58.761 --> 02:04:01.820
<v Speaker 2>the people so that they could keep them</v>
<v Speaker 2>stupid and keep them under foot.</v>

2813
02:04:01.970 --> 02:04:04.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and those people.</v>

2814
02:04:04.220 --> 02:04:08.240
<v Speaker 2>There was a patriarchy there too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>except that the patriarch was god or</v>

2815
02:04:08.450 --> 02:04:11.960
<v Speaker 2>papa the pope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was really the clergy more than it</v>

2816
02:04:11.961 --> 02:04:14.240
<v Speaker 2>was god.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God wasn't really enforcing these laws,</v>

2817
02:04:14.241 --> 02:04:17.960
<v Speaker 2>but the literal patriarch pope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was one of the most problematic</v>

2818
02:04:18.020 --> 02:04:21.320
<v Speaker 2>things about martin luther apparently</v>
<v Speaker 2>was that he was telling people,</v>

2819
02:04:21.321 --> 02:04:23.720
<v Speaker 2>you're allowed to interpret what this</v>
<v Speaker 2>means.</v>

2820
02:04:24.380 --> 02:04:27.800
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to accept anybody else's</v>
<v Speaker 2>interpretation because they're just men</v>

2821
02:04:27.801 --> 02:04:28.700
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2822
02:04:28.780 --> 02:04:30.440
<v Speaker 2>Those are just human beings</v>
<v Speaker 2>interpretation,</v>

2823
02:04:30.500 --> 02:04:34.130
<v Speaker 2>interpreting the word of god,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you interpret it to be a different</v>

2824
02:04:34.131 --> 02:04:35.450
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're allowed to do that.</v>

2825
02:04:35.451 --> 02:04:37.560
<v Speaker 2>And they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what in the fuck is this saying?</v>

2826
02:04:37.790 --> 02:04:38.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2827
02:04:38.060 --> 02:04:40.440
<v Speaker 5>I mean think about how seductive that</v>
<v Speaker 5>must've been for the church.</v>

2828
02:04:40.470 --> 02:04:40.861
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2829
02:04:40.861 --> 02:04:43.860
<v Speaker 5>we can just keep the information from</v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody and just tell them anything we</v>

2830
02:04:43.861 --> 02:04:45.860
<v Speaker 5>want.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'll bAck then also the.</v>

2831
02:04:45.960 --> 02:04:50.040
<v Speaker 5>The pope had women.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The pope was allowed to fuck all the</v>

2832
02:04:50.041 --> 02:04:51.720
<v Speaker 5>clergy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck they were rockstars.</v>

2833
02:04:51.810 --> 02:04:55.380
<v Speaker 5>They weren't what we think of now as</v>
<v Speaker 5>these creepy dudes molest children,</v>

2834
02:04:55.410 --> 02:04:56.130
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2835
02:04:56.130 --> 02:04:58.050
<v Speaker 5>they were fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There were.</v>

2836
02:04:58.860 --> 02:05:03.810
<v Speaker 5>These were people that had armies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean they called upon the pope when</v>

2837
02:05:03.811 --> 02:05:08.700
<v Speaker 5>gang is con was conquering,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like going over the steps and conquering</v>

2838
02:05:08.701 --> 02:05:11.340
<v Speaker 5>Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were calling upon the pope and</v>

2839
02:05:11.341 --> 02:05:15.810
<v Speaker 5>though the army of rome,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's literally where he had</v>

2840
02:05:15.811 --> 02:05:18.120
<v Speaker 5>power.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's very strange when you look at how</v>

2841
02:05:18.121 --> 02:05:22.740
<v Speaker 5>that's changed and now it's become this</v>
<v Speaker 5>weird cabal of odd older gay men,</v>

2842

<v Speaker 5>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what do you think of that's about by the</v>

2843

<v Speaker 5>way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>thank you.</v>

2844
02:05:25.230 --> 02:05:28.380

<v Speaker 5>and the only people that are going to</v>

2845
02:05:28.381 --> 02:05:32.610
<v Speaker 5>stay are the people that are creepy and</v>
<v Speaker 5>sexually repressed and there's a few</v>

2846

<v Speaker 5>that hang in there and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2848
02:05:37.231 --> 02:05:41.220
<v Speaker 5>get weirded out and then sex becomes</v>
<v Speaker 5>this horrible taboo thing and of course</v>

2849
02:05:41.221 --> 02:05:45.250
<v Speaker 5>when sex becomes a horrible taboo thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then people gravitate towards sex.</v>

2850
02:05:45.450 --> 02:05:48.690
<v Speaker 5>She'd take the ability of people to have</v>
<v Speaker 5>sex away from people.</v>

2851
02:05:49.020 --> 02:05:52.440
<v Speaker 5>They want to have sex more than they</v>
<v Speaker 5>want anything in life,</v>

2852
02:05:52.620 --> 02:05:55.050
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like a or or is the opposite?</v>

2853
02:05:55.051 --> 02:05:56.460
<v Speaker 5>True?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is it that people are.</v>

2854
02:05:56.490 --> 02:06:01.490
<v Speaker 5>Predators are attracted to a system that</v>
<v Speaker 5>is shrouded in privacy and no sex and</v>

2855
02:06:02.521 --> 02:06:03.650
<v Speaker 5>they can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2856
02:06:04.220 --> 02:06:05.850
<v Speaker 5>they can.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I gueSs the question is like,</v>

2857
02:06:06.060 --> 02:06:10.230
<v Speaker 5>do you go in there trying to be holy or</v>
<v Speaker 5>trying to get away from your sexuality</v>

2858
02:06:10.231 --> 02:06:14.460
<v Speaker 5>that then bursts out in this abberant</v>
<v Speaker 5>way or are you an absolute monster that</v>

2859
02:06:14.670 --> 02:06:17.880
<v Speaker 5>goes into the clergy to prey on people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but once it's been established,</v>

2860
02:06:17.910 --> 02:06:20.190
<v Speaker 5>maybe both,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but once it's been established,</v>

2861
02:06:20.191 --> 02:06:22.230
<v Speaker 5>that becomes part of the issue because</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you're,</v>

2862
02:06:22.410 --> 02:06:25.810
<v Speaker 5>you're also indoctrinating young</v>
<v Speaker 5>children that do get molested by the</v>

2863
02:06:25.830 --> 02:06:26.610
<v Speaker 5>priest.</v>

2864
02:06:26.610 --> 02:06:29.850
<v Speaker 5>If you have some altar boys and these</v>
<v Speaker 5>priests molesting these kids and they</v>

2865
02:06:29.851 --> 02:06:33.480
<v Speaker 5>stay in the system,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the odds of them turning into molesters</v>

2866
02:06:33.481 --> 02:06:35.470
<v Speaker 5>themselves or it's extremely high.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2867
02:06:35.910 --> 02:06:37.140
<v Speaker 5>What do you think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2868
02:06:37.740 --> 02:06:40.590
<v Speaker 5>why do you think people molest children?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Boy,</v>

2869
02:06:40.620 --> 02:06:44.700
<v Speaker 5>I think there's probably a whole host of</v>
<v Speaker 5>reasons for that psychological reasons,</v>

2870
02:06:44.701 --> 02:06:48.270
<v Speaker 5>but I think that a big part of it was</v>
<v Speaker 5>being molested themselves.</v>

2871
02:06:48.340 --> 02:06:53.010
<v Speaker 5>There's some enormous percentage of</v>
<v Speaker 5>people who have been molested,</v>

2872
02:06:53.011 --> 02:06:55.860
<v Speaker 5>who turned to become the very thing that</v>
<v Speaker 5>victimized them.</v>

2873
02:06:55.861 --> 02:07:00.160
<v Speaker 5>It's almost like they want to get back</v>
<v Speaker 5>at someone and best way to do the</v>

2874
02:07:00.180 --> 02:07:01.140
<v Speaker 5>attack,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the innocent.</v>

2875
02:07:01.141 --> 02:07:04.160
<v Speaker 5>It's the only way you can impart that</v>
<v Speaker 5>same har crazy.</v>

2876
02:07:04.190 --> 02:07:06.660
<v Speaker 5>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's also like a kind of weird dark</v>

2877
02:07:06.661 --> 02:07:07.650
<v Speaker 5>magic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

2878
02:07:07.740 --> 02:07:09.660
<v Speaker 5>why are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why are there a certain percentage of</v>

2879
02:07:09.661 --> 02:07:11.880
<v Speaker 5>human beings that do that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Kind of the weirdest,</v>

2880
02:07:11.881 --> 02:07:14.940
<v Speaker 5>most abhorrent thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you hear the,</v>

2881
02:07:15.030 --> 02:07:18.650
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a really interesting radiolab,</v>

2882
02:07:18.720 --> 02:07:21.660
<v Speaker 5>I think episode that's basically about</v>
<v Speaker 5>these kids,</v>

2883
02:07:21.750 --> 02:07:25.890
<v Speaker 5>this kid who realized that he was a</v>
<v Speaker 5>pedophile,</v>

2884
02:07:26.370 --> 02:07:29.820
<v Speaker 5>like he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what he wanted and he realized</v>

2885
02:07:29.821 --> 02:07:33.180
<v Speaker 5>he'd never offended.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that a reason why it's a few years</v>

2886
02:07:33.180 --> 02:07:34.410
<v Speaker 5>old,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he realized he'd never,</v>

2887
02:07:34.620 --> 02:07:36.130
<v Speaker 5>he had never offended.</v>

2888
02:07:36.700 --> 02:07:38.350
<v Speaker 2>And so he went to his mother and was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2889
02:07:38.470 --> 02:07:41.740
<v Speaker 2>there's something wrong with me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm a pedophile or whatever.</v>

2890
02:07:42.140 --> 02:07:44.830
<v Speaker 2>It's like a teenager.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the mother tried to find</v>

2891
02:07:44.831 --> 02:07:49.831
<v Speaker 2>treatment for him but nobody would treat</v>
<v Speaker 2>him because it's such a deep taboo of</v>

2892
02:07:50.440 --> 02:07:53.140
<v Speaker 2>evil that people like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to get involved in that.</v>

2893
02:07:53.800 --> 02:07:56.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to treat you and then have</v>
<v Speaker 2>you offended and then have it come back</v>

2894
02:07:56.531 --> 02:07:59.110
<v Speaker 2>on me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So basically he'd never offended.</v>

2895
02:07:59.380 --> 02:08:04.030
<v Speaker 2>He had these desires and he couldn't get</v>
<v Speaker 2>help and he started this organization</v>

2896
02:08:04.450 --> 02:08:09.130
<v Speaker 2>for other people like him that it's like</v>
<v Speaker 2>a support group of pedophiles that have</v>

2897
02:08:09.131 --> 02:08:10.420
<v Speaker 2>never offended.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't.</v>

2898
02:08:10.421 --> 02:08:15.340
<v Speaker 2>If you've offended you're not eligible</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a membership in this group and you</v>

2899
02:08:15.341 --> 02:08:20.341
<v Speaker 2>can help each other not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like pretty deep in the annals of</v>

2900
02:08:20.710 --> 02:08:23.320
<v Speaker 2>like with a weird dark web or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or I don't know where they find each</v>

2901
02:08:23.321 --> 02:08:24.490
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

2902
02:08:24.610 --> 02:08:25.443
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty crazy.</v>

2903
02:08:25.520 --> 02:08:27.280
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

2904
02:08:27.360 --> 02:08:31.460
<v Speaker 3>there's a whole market that's being</v>
<v Speaker 3>developed where they're going to make</v>

2905
02:08:31.730 --> 02:08:35.740
<v Speaker 3>like artificial children on like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2906
02:08:35.900 --> 02:08:37.730
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a sex doll,</v>

2907
02:08:37.760 --> 02:08:40.730
<v Speaker 3>like a child sex doll.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's this argument that that</v>

2908
02:08:40.731 --> 02:08:44.210
<v Speaker 3>would prevent people from becoming</v>
<v Speaker 3>pederasts.</v>

2909
02:08:44.310 --> 02:08:45.960
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is crazy.</v>

2910
02:08:45.961 --> 02:08:49.230
<v Speaker 2>Like the ultimate iteration of</v>
<v Speaker 2>teledildonics is that it cures</v>

2911
02:08:49.860 --> 02:08:50.693
<v Speaker 2>pedophilia.</v>

2912
02:08:51.190 --> 02:08:53.410
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the same argument they would use</v>

2913
02:08:53.411 --> 02:08:55.560
<v Speaker 3>towards a anime,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anime,</v>

2914
02:08:55.570 --> 02:08:57.610
<v Speaker 3>pedophilia or any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any sort of,</v>

2915
02:08:57.611 --> 02:08:58.710
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2916
02:08:58.720 --> 02:09:03.370
<v Speaker 3>cgi based pedophilia is that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you could look at child porn,</v>

2917
02:09:03.460 --> 02:09:07.420
<v Speaker 3>that's not real and no one's a victim of</v>
<v Speaker 3>it and your lock yourself in your room,</v>

2918
02:09:07.421 --> 02:09:10.450
<v Speaker 3>you could alleviate your desire to have</v>
<v Speaker 3>this thing,</v>

2919
02:09:11.440 --> 02:09:13.670
<v Speaker 3>but maybe that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Problem with that is man,</v>

2920
02:09:13.760 --> 02:09:17.410
<v Speaker 3>there's a real argument that that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>feeding your desire to do that because</v>

2921
02:09:17.411 --> 02:09:20.710
<v Speaker 3>that's what happens with men when it</v>
<v Speaker 3>comes to regular pornography.</v>

2922
02:09:20.800 --> 02:09:23.480
<v Speaker 2>just what I was going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would only hold true if it wasn't</v>

2923
02:09:23.481 --> 02:09:26.470
<v Speaker 2>for the fact that you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you didn't see something important to</v>

2924
02:09:26.471 --> 02:09:27.304
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to try that.</v>

2925
02:09:27.700 --> 02:09:30.340
<v Speaker 3>I think the problem is we're looking for</v>
<v Speaker 3>a solution like,</v>

2926
02:09:30.341 --> 02:09:31.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2927
02:09:31.020 --> 02:09:32.440
<v Speaker 3>there's a fire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>throw water on it.</v>

2928
02:09:32.441 --> 02:09:36.790
<v Speaker 3>There's no like when it comes to people</v>
<v Speaker 3>and thinking especially like sexual</v>

2929
02:09:36.791 --> 02:09:39.460
<v Speaker 3>things and behavioral things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a dictum things.</v>

2930
02:09:39.940 --> 02:09:40.960
<v Speaker 3>people are messy.</v>

2931
02:09:41.200 --> 02:09:43.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a crazy ted talk.</v>

2932
02:09:43.571 --> 02:09:47.320
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a ted talk out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This woman who's worked with teenage sex</v>

2933
02:09:47.321 --> 02:09:52.321
<v Speaker 2>offenders like her whole career and she</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically says that we think of that.</v>

2934
02:09:55.610 --> 02:09:57.910
<v Speaker 2>It's at least with teenage sex</v>
<v Speaker 2>offenders,</v>

2935
02:09:58.060 --> 02:10:02.020
<v Speaker 2>which is like pedophilia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>teenage on younger pedophilia.</v>

2936
02:10:02.440 --> 02:10:07.440
<v Speaker 2>The cure and recidivism rate is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's extremely treatable,</v>

2937
02:10:07.990 --> 02:10:09.250
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's very,</v>

2938
02:10:09.251 --> 02:10:13.330
<v Speaker 2>very treatable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we look at that phenomenon as you.</v>

2939
02:10:13.360 --> 02:10:16.150
<v Speaker 2>Once you are that you are that forever</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you will always re-offend and</v>

2940
02:10:16.151 --> 02:10:21.130
<v Speaker 2>there's no hope and no going back from</v>
<v Speaker 2>it and it's not statistically that</v>

2941
02:10:21.190 --> 02:10:24.340
<v Speaker 2>doesn't hold water and her point is</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically like,</v>

2942
02:10:25.090 --> 02:10:29.320
<v Speaker 2>it is easier for us to think of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>people as monsters than to think of them</v>

2943
02:10:29.321 --> 02:10:30.910
<v Speaker 2>as sick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People that could get better if we can</v>

2944
02:10:30.911 --> 02:10:33.770
<v Speaker 2>just say like throw them away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll never be better</v>

2945
02:10:34.190 --> 02:10:36.620
<v Speaker 1>than we can kind of synthesize it into</v>
<v Speaker 1>our brain.</v>

2946
02:10:36.621 --> 02:10:40.300
<v Speaker 1>But in reality these are messy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you said,</v>

2947
02:10:40.640 --> 02:10:42.610
<v Speaker 3>even bring that up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you just said.</v>

2948
02:10:42.611 --> 02:10:44.300
<v Speaker 3>You're a sympathizer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2949
02:10:44.830 --> 02:10:47.350
<v Speaker 3>You know that these people are monsters</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think the idea is that,</v>

2950
02:10:47.580 --> 02:10:49.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were talking about spectrums like</v>

2951
02:10:49.300 --> 02:10:52.060
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like say if you get a 100,000 people,</v>

2952
02:10:52.061 --> 02:10:52.600
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

2953
02:10:52.600 --> 02:10:57.400
<v Speaker 3>how many of those hundred thousand</v>
<v Speaker 3>people feel like they were born into the</v>

2954
02:10:57.401 --> 02:10:59.470
<v Speaker 3>wrong sex?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know how many,</v>

2955
02:10:59.500 --> 02:11:04.210
<v Speaker 3>how many of those 100,000 people have</v>
<v Speaker 3>some bizarre sexual attraction to body</v>

2956
02:11:04.211 --> 02:11:09.211
<v Speaker 3>parts or to a underage people or to</v>
<v Speaker 3>older people,</v>

2957
02:11:09.250 --> 02:11:10.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>vulnerable people.</v>

2958
02:11:10.601 --> 02:11:14.440
<v Speaker 3>There'S,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a bunch and what causes those</v>

2959
02:11:14.441 --> 02:11:16.870
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a host of different reasons,</v>

2960
02:11:17.290 --> 02:11:21.040
<v Speaker 3>but it's so messy and so complicated for</v>
<v Speaker 3>people to defend,</v>

2961
02:11:21.041 --> 02:11:23.270
<v Speaker 3>especially to defend pedophilia in any</v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

2962
02:11:23.850 --> 02:11:25.020
<v Speaker 3>It's a radioactive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2963
02:11:25.040 --> 02:11:26.380
<v Speaker 3>You want to kill those people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

2964
02:11:26.381 --> 02:11:27.640
<v Speaker 3>That solution is killam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>killam,</v>

2965
02:11:27.641 --> 02:11:28.400
<v Speaker 3>black and white.</v>

2966
02:11:28.400 --> 02:11:29.630
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2967
02:11:29.690 --> 02:11:33.410
<v Speaker 1>Everybody in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this makes every player in this story</v>

2968
02:11:33.411 --> 02:11:35.810
<v Speaker 1>makes sense where it doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>History.</v>

2969
02:11:36.380 --> 02:11:36.831
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2970
02:11:36.831 --> 02:11:38.180
<v Speaker 1>Because they used to have different</v>
<v Speaker 1>views of.</v>

2971
02:11:38.220 --> 02:11:41.120
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make sense that everybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was like,</v>

2972
02:11:41.360 --> 02:11:42.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

2973

<v Speaker 1>I mean you go through the line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were all monSters,</v>

2975
02:11:46.441 --> 02:11:49.030
<v Speaker 1>so it was their quote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never been able to verify it's</v>

2976
02:11:49.040 --> 02:11:49.873
<v Speaker 1>real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the.</v>

2977
02:11:50.140 --> 02:11:52.820
<v Speaker 1>They say the persian said a woman for</v>
<v Speaker 1>duty,</v>

2978
02:11:52.940 --> 02:11:55.370

<v Speaker 1>ecstasy.</v>

<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

2981
02:12:02.261 --> 02:12:04.060
<v Speaker 3>That's ecstasy because it lived in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>desert.</v>

2982
02:12:04.150 --> 02:12:05.740
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure they fucked a melon.</v>

<v Speaker 3>gone over to Afghanistan to write.</v>

2991

<v Speaker 1>Especially as a guy with daughters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not really.</v>

3017
02:13:29.241 --> 02:13:30.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a.</v>

02:13:30.620 --> 02:13:32.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't have daughters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you throw it back</v>

3019
02:13:32.070 --> 02:13:33.070

<v Speaker 5>Actually wrote back.</v>

3020
02:13:33.170 --> 02:13:34.830
<v Speaker 5>That's how that's going to have a son</v>
<v Speaker 5>either</v>

3021
02:13:36.630 --> 02:13:39.360
<v Speaker 5>do any melons.</v>
<v Speaker 5>MelonS up there.</v>

3022
02:13:39.420 --> 02:13:44.420
<v Speaker 5>It's what we're looking at about 10.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It looks like maybe younger even.</v>

3023
02:13:45.310 --> 02:13:46.143
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3024
02:13:46.200 --> 02:13:48.090
<v Speaker 5>that was disturbing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3025
02:13:48.120 --> 02:13:50.340
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the ideas that somehow or another</v>

3026
02:13:50.341 --> 02:13:53.280
<v Speaker 5>that's going to be able to stop people</v>
<v Speaker 5>from molesting kids by fucking that</v>

3027
02:13:53.281 --> 02:13:58.200
<v Speaker 5>rubber doll or is it going to charge up</v>
<v Speaker 5>their desires even further?</v>

3028
02:13:58.220 --> 02:13:58.560
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3029
02:13:58.560 --> 02:13:59.790
<v Speaker 5>that's a crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

3030
02:13:59.880 --> 02:14:00.930
<v Speaker 5>I have no way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No way to.</v>

3031
02:14:01.560 --> 02:14:02.760
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't want to fuck a dog by the</v>
<v Speaker 5>way.</v>

3032
02:14:02.790 --> 02:14:05.760
<v Speaker 5>That's the number one argument against</v>
<v Speaker 5>pornography.</v>

3033
02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:07.560
<v Speaker 5>Pornography rather.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Prostitution.</v>

3034
02:14:07.860 --> 02:14:11.790
<v Speaker 5>Number one argument that I've ever heard</v>
<v Speaker 5>against it because I feel like a grown</v>

3035
02:14:11.791 --> 02:14:13.560
<v Speaker 5>woman,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she'd be like,</v>

3036
02:14:13.590 --> 02:14:15.780
<v Speaker 5>there's all sorts of levels of</v>
<v Speaker 5>prostitution,</v>

3037
02:14:16.080 --> 02:14:17.760
<v Speaker 5>like here's the level,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's,</v>

3038
02:14:17.790 --> 02:14:21.270
<v Speaker 5>here's an acceptable level.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A woman who likes to give massages.</v>

3039
02:14:21.540 --> 02:14:25.110
<v Speaker 5>Say if you're a woman and you're a</v>
<v Speaker 5>massage therapist and you have a select</v>

3040
02:14:25.111 --> 02:14:27.510
<v Speaker 5>group of clients and you enjoy giving</v>
<v Speaker 5>those men massages,</v>

3041
02:14:27.720 --> 02:14:30.360
<v Speaker 5>you're giving them some sort of physical</v>
<v Speaker 5>pleasure with their body.</v>

3042
02:14:30.540 --> 02:14:35.010
<v Speaker 5>You can have the same sort of deal with</v>
<v Speaker 5>a bunch of people and give them sex,</v>

3043
02:14:35.040 --> 02:14:35.730
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

3044
02:14:35.730 --> 02:14:38.580
<v Speaker 5>And that's all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just a in you like them.</v>

3045
02:14:38.581 --> 02:14:40.050
<v Speaker 5>They're your friends.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You hugged them,</v>

3046
02:14:40.051 --> 02:14:42.280
<v Speaker 5>they give you some money and you're.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Thank you.</v>

3047
02:14:42.330 --> 02:14:44.340
<v Speaker 5>We'll see you next tuesday.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You gonna keep your tuesday appointment.</v>

3048
02:14:44.341 --> 02:14:44.981
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

3049
02:14:44.981 --> 02:14:47.020
<v Speaker 5>I'll see you tuesday.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The guy looks forward to tuesday,</v>

3050
02:14:47.021 --> 02:14:48.870
<v Speaker 5>caesar on tuesday.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They get together.</v>

3051
02:14:49.050 --> 02:14:49.590
<v Speaker 5>She,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3052
02:14:49.590 --> 02:14:52.230
<v Speaker 5>she gives him a backrub.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She light some candles.</v>

3053
02:14:52.231 --> 02:14:53.610
<v Speaker 5>They have sex.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He gives her money.</v>

3054
02:14:53.910 --> 02:14:56.820
<v Speaker 5>That's to me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a victimless crime.</v>

3055
02:14:56.821 --> 02:15:00.690
<v Speaker 5>One hundred percent,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then you get into the idea of sex</v>

3056
02:15:00.691 --> 02:15:03.690
<v Speaker 5>slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You get into the idea of indenture child</v>

3057
02:15:03.691 --> 02:15:06.270
<v Speaker 5>sex slaves and there's actually a</v>
<v Speaker 5>crazier argument.</v>

3058
02:15:06.300 --> 02:15:09.120
<v Speaker 5>I'm not crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but more a more even more compelling</v>

3059
02:15:09.121 --> 02:15:12.090
<v Speaker 5>argument for the moral good of</v>
<v Speaker 5>prostitution,</v>

3060
02:15:12.570 --> 02:15:15.990
<v Speaker 5>which is that there are these</v>
<v Speaker 5>prostitutes that only sleep with a</v>

3061
02:15:16.410 --> 02:15:18.640
<v Speaker 5>severely disabled people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3062
02:15:18.840 --> 02:15:21.180
<v Speaker 5>and I heard this radio special on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was very interesting.</v>

3063
02:15:21.181 --> 02:15:23.560
<v Speaker 5>This guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he himself was a radio producer but also</v>

3064
02:15:23.840 --> 02:15:27.330
<v Speaker 5>had lou gehrig's disease and he said</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's very similar to pedophiles.</v>

3065
02:15:27.331 --> 02:15:31.350
<v Speaker 5>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We like to think of disabled people as</v>

3066
02:15:31.351 --> 02:15:34.290
<v Speaker 5>having no sex drive as when they became</v>
<v Speaker 5>disabled.</v>

3067
02:15:34.291 --> 02:15:37.800
<v Speaker 5>Their sex drive's were disabled as well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the reason we like to think of it</v>

3068
02:15:38.130 --> 02:15:39.770
<v Speaker 5>similarly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we like to think a pedophiles as</v>

3069
02:15:39.780 --> 02:15:43.200
<v Speaker 5>monsters because that simplifies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is it's nice for us to think of</v>

3070
02:15:43.201 --> 02:15:46.560
<v Speaker 5>disabled people like not having</v>
<v Speaker 5>horniness because they can't get laid.</v>

3071
02:15:46.590 --> 02:15:49.920
<v Speaker 5>I mean if we're being frank,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there are certain levels of disability</v>

3072
02:15:49.921 --> 02:15:51.900
<v Speaker 5>that it's very difficult to find a</v>
<v Speaker 5>partner,</v>

3073
02:15:51.960 --> 02:15:52.501
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

3074
02:15:52.501 --> 02:15:55.590
<v Speaker 5>you're intense to look at or you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>drooling all over yourself,</v>

3075
02:15:56.160 --> 02:15:57.990
<v Speaker 5>but you're still just as horny as every</v>
<v Speaker 5>other person.</v>

3076
02:15:58.230 --> 02:16:02.010
<v Speaker 5>So there was this radio special of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>sex workers that go and they fuck or</v>

3077
02:16:02.011 --> 02:16:06.460
<v Speaker 5>jerk-off these severely disabled people</v>
<v Speaker 5>who are so they are so disabled they</v>

3078
02:16:06.461 --> 02:16:09.210
<v Speaker 5>can't even masturbate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's like,</v>

3079
02:16:09.810 --> 02:16:12.200
<v Speaker 5>I heard that and I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I went from going like it.</v>

3080
02:16:12.240 --> 02:16:15.000
<v Speaker 5>Prostitution is something I sort of</v>
<v Speaker 5>agree with to like,</v>

3081
02:16:15.150 --> 02:16:18.210
<v Speaker 5>these people are heroes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These are like miracle workers.</v>

3082
02:16:18.360 --> 02:16:20.820
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's not a whole lot different</v>

3083
02:16:20.821 --> 02:16:23.760
<v Speaker 5>than massaging those people that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3084
02:16:23.761 --> 02:16:25.860
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the key,</v>

3085
02:16:26.280 --> 02:16:27.690
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if you've ever heard of</v>
<v Speaker 5>rolfing,</v>

3086
02:16:27.691 --> 02:16:29.980
<v Speaker 5>you've heard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>so one of the best</v>

3087
02:16:29.980 --> 02:16:34.420
<v Speaker 3>therapies for injuries to recover,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it breaks up fascia and it's really</v>

3088
02:16:34.421 --> 02:16:37.000
<v Speaker 3>brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Deep tissue massage that doesn't feel</v>

3089
02:16:37.001 --> 02:16:38.080
<v Speaker 3>good at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very painful,</v>

3090
02:16:38.210 --> 02:16:41.070
<v Speaker 2>a massage inside of your mouth and your</v>
<v Speaker 2>nose to do that.</v>

3091
02:16:41.280 --> 02:16:43.460
<v Speaker 2>There's like a ralph 10 and one of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>10,</v>

3092
02:16:43.530 --> 02:16:47.940
<v Speaker 2>the 10 different treatments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the 10 is the soft palate of</v>

3093
02:16:47.941 --> 02:16:50.160
<v Speaker 2>your mouth inside of your nos inside</v>
<v Speaker 2>your nose.</v>

3094
02:16:50.220 --> 02:16:51.870
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's real intense.</v>

3095
02:16:52.020 --> 02:16:53.730
<v Speaker 2>Why do they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3096
02:16:53.910 --> 02:16:56.610
<v Speaker 2>Some theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I'm going to fucking</v>

3097
02:16:56.611 --> 02:16:59.190
<v Speaker 2>just go on a theory and let you stick a</v>
<v Speaker 2>rod up my nose.</v>

3098
02:16:59.191 --> 02:17:01.170
<v Speaker 2>I know that it's their fingers.</v>

3099
02:17:01.280 --> 02:17:02.450
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come on.</v>

3100
02:17:02.451 --> 02:17:03.940
<v Speaker 3>You're not even supposed to pick your</v>
<v Speaker 3>nose,</v>

3101
02:17:03.990 --> 02:17:05.150
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3102
02:17:05.180 --> 02:17:07.910
<v Speaker 3>you're talking to a guy who's had nasal</v>
<v Speaker 3>surgery because my nose was broken so</v>

3103
02:17:07.911 --> 02:17:10.310
<v Speaker 3>many times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've deviated septum surgery where they</v>

3104
02:17:10.311 --> 02:17:14.300
<v Speaker 3>went in and they had a cut parts of my</v>
<v Speaker 3>nose out that calcified.</v>

3105
02:17:15.140 --> 02:17:17.200
<v Speaker 3>Oh jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to this gala.</v>

3106
02:17:18.850 --> 02:17:22.790
<v Speaker 3>Our structural integration knows work</v>
<v Speaker 3>for insight.</v>

3107
02:17:23.780 --> 02:17:25.840
<v Speaker 3>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that visual.</v>

3108
02:17:26.270 --> 02:17:28.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's some asshole that wants</v>

3109
02:17:28.251 --> 02:17:30.980
<v Speaker 3>to stick their finger up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your nose doesn't make any sense.</v>

3110
02:17:31.130 --> 02:17:33.200
<v Speaker 3>Nasal doctors tell you not to pick your</v>
<v Speaker 3>nose.</v>

3111
02:17:33.710 --> 02:17:37.010
<v Speaker 3>Cause infections.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very close to the bloodstream.</v>

3112
02:17:37.011 --> 02:17:40.150
<v Speaker 3>The thIn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the skin is very thin on the inside of</v>

3113
02:17:40.151 --> 02:17:41.720
<v Speaker 3>the nose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why picking your nose is</v>

3114
02:17:41.721 --> 02:17:44.660
<v Speaker 3>dangerous because you can get infections</v>
<v Speaker 3>and infection goes right to your</v>

3115
02:17:44.661 --> 02:17:47.490
<v Speaker 3>bloodstream and straight to your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3116
02:17:47.570 --> 02:17:48.950
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3117
02:17:49.020 --> 02:17:49.700
<v Speaker 3>we started.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3118
02:17:49.700 --> 02:17:52.130
<v Speaker 3>so rolfing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like what they do is,</v>

3119
02:17:52.131 --> 02:17:55.280
<v Speaker 3>I'm ida rolf,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the woman who invented rolfing.</v>

3120
02:17:55.340 --> 02:17:56.173
<v Speaker 3>I think that's her name.</v>

3121
02:17:56.820 --> 02:17:58.500
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really a dog from the muppets.</v>

3122
02:17:58.770 --> 02:18:01.740
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's off the dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think the piano player.</v>

3123
02:18:01.800 --> 02:18:02.850
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not the same role.</v>

3124
02:18:03.760 --> 02:18:04.231
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

3125
02:18:04.231 --> 02:18:06.690
<v Speaker 3>go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the woman invented it because</v>

3126
02:18:06.691 --> 02:18:11.460
<v Speaker 3>her son had cerebral palsy and was one</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the best ways to alleviate some of</v>

3127
02:18:11.461 --> 02:18:16.260
<v Speaker 3>his mess muscle issues was this intense</v>
<v Speaker 3>form of manipulation because he'd become</v>

3128
02:18:16.261 --> 02:18:21.090
<v Speaker 3>so bound up by his disease that she had</v>
<v Speaker 3>figured out a way to loosen up the</v>

3129
02:18:21.091 --> 02:18:25.680
<v Speaker 3>tissue so they had more range of motion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I found some great relief with that</v>

3130
02:18:25.681 --> 02:18:27.470
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's ruthlessly pain.</v>

3131
02:18:27.670 --> 02:18:29.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had some rolfing done to.</v>

3132
02:18:29.300 --> 02:18:29.840
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3133
02:18:29.840 --> 02:18:31.570
<v Speaker 2>it's nice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also awful.</v>

3134
02:18:31.720 --> 02:18:33.850
<v Speaker 2>it's great in its result.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But man,</v>

3135
02:18:33.851 --> 02:18:37.090
<v Speaker 2>it's brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to make one final point about</v>

3136
02:18:37.160 --> 02:18:41.140
<v Speaker 2>that because I think I figured out how</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make my cultural appropriation point.</v>

3137
02:18:41.860 --> 02:18:43.540
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to take us back too far,</v>

3138
02:18:43.541 --> 02:18:47.620
<v Speaker 2>but I think what we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we're doing is like we came to a</v>

3139
02:18:47.621 --> 02:18:50.890
<v Speaker 2>good place with a dislike.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we're talking about.</v>

3140
02:18:50.891 --> 02:18:51.880
<v Speaker 2>It's all about language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3141
02:18:51.881 --> 02:18:54.420
<v Speaker 2>So cultural appropriation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your immediate reaction is that's</v>

3142
02:18:54.540 --> 02:18:56.830
<v Speaker 2>absurd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And some of the examples people use is</v>

3143
02:18:56.831 --> 02:18:58.020
<v Speaker 2>absurd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

3144
02:18:58.280 --> 02:19:00.640
<v Speaker 2>the underneath the racism is just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about racial</v>

3145
02:19:00.650 --> 02:19:02.950
<v Speaker 2>insensitivity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about being sensitive and</v>

3146
02:19:02.951 --> 02:19:07.090
<v Speaker 2>if you try to just focus on that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can get to like other reality</v>

3147
02:19:07.091 --> 02:19:09.580
<v Speaker 2>of what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the original point I wanted to make</v>

3148
02:19:09.581 --> 02:19:13.780
<v Speaker 2>waS in this article I read about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it said that we often get locked on</v>

3149
02:19:13.781 --> 02:19:18.300
<v Speaker 2>these linguistic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the boat that the concept floats in on</v>

3150
02:19:18.310 --> 02:19:19.180
<v Speaker 2>the absurd boat.</v>

3151
02:19:19.390 --> 02:19:21.520
<v Speaker 2>So like black lives matter is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimate example you gave.</v>

3152
02:19:21.521 --> 02:19:23.050
<v Speaker 2>I just thought this was such a</v>
<v Speaker 2>fascinating point,</v>

3153
02:19:23.350 --> 02:19:28.220
<v Speaker 2>is like black lives matter is the name</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the organization that is there to</v>

3154
02:19:28.221 --> 02:19:31.610
<v Speaker 2>fight against police brutality and</v>
<v Speaker 2>killing of black kids.</v>

3155
02:19:31.760 --> 02:19:34.520
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people react to the words,</v>

3156
02:19:34.760 --> 02:19:36.110
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So people go,</v>

3157
02:19:36.140 --> 02:19:37.430
<v Speaker 2>what are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Black lives matter.</v>

3158
02:19:37.460 --> 02:19:39.170
<v Speaker 2>All lives matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Blue lives matter.</v>

3159
02:19:39.470 --> 02:19:44.150
<v Speaker 2>And basically if you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't acknowledge that it's black</v>

3160
02:19:44.151 --> 02:19:46.370
<v Speaker 2>lives matter too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really obvious,</v>

3161
02:19:46.490 --> 02:19:48.650
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're fighting about the words black</v>

3162
02:19:48.651 --> 02:19:50.870
<v Speaker 2>lives matter where we haven't been</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking.</v>

3163
02:19:50.930 --> 02:19:54.950
<v Speaker 2>You've left the foundation principle</v>
<v Speaker 2>behind like a long time ago,</v>

3164
02:19:55.010 --> 02:19:56.870
<v Speaker 2>which is police brutality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one's even talking about police</v>

3165
02:19:56.871 --> 02:19:58.550
<v Speaker 2>brutality anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now they're just talking about the</v>

3166
02:19:58.551 --> 02:20:00.440
<v Speaker 2>language that you chose to call your</v>
<v Speaker 2>group.</v>

3167
02:20:01.040 --> 02:20:03.590
<v Speaker 2>So at any rate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that was the thing I was trying</v>

3168
02:20:03.591 --> 02:20:04.424
<v Speaker 2>to say.</v>

3169
02:20:04.730 --> 02:20:05.630
<v Speaker 3>Make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

3170
02:20:06.110 --> 02:20:10.130
<v Speaker 3>all of it makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If what is going on is people are being</v>

3171
02:20:10.131 --> 02:20:11.550
<v Speaker 3>racist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3172
02:20:11.640 --> 02:20:15.960
<v Speaker 3>If someone is doing something for racial</v>
<v Speaker 3>and appropriation or sex or culture and</v>

3173
02:20:15.961 --> 02:20:20.030
<v Speaker 3>appropriation at the heart of it</v>
<v Speaker 3>involves racial insensitivity,</v>

3174
02:20:20.080 --> 02:20:20.660
<v Speaker 3>racist</v>

3175
02:20:20.660 --> 02:20:23.150
<v Speaker 2>insensitivity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a difference,</v>

3176
02:20:23.240 --> 02:20:24.620
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Racist.</v>

3177
02:20:25.310 --> 02:20:28.310
<v Speaker 2>Theoretically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>racist is an.</v>

3178
02:20:28.370 --> 02:20:29.990
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>racism is a word that doesn't have a lot</v>

3179
02:20:29.991 --> 02:20:33.980
<v Speaker 2>of use anymore either because you</v>
<v Speaker 2>described the same phenomenon of you</v>

3180
02:20:33.981 --> 02:20:35.600
<v Speaker 2>saying too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like your black friend.</v>

3181
02:20:35.660 --> 02:20:38.360
<v Speaker 2>Like wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't expect you to be so articulate.</v>

3182
02:20:38.390 --> 02:20:39.510
<v Speaker 2>You mean well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3183
02:20:40.280 --> 02:20:44.420
<v Speaker 2>You mean you're trying to be polite or.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like black people there.</v>

3184
02:20:44.590 --> 02:20:46.340
<v Speaker 2>They're bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are the same.</v>

3185
02:20:46.430 --> 02:20:48.320
<v Speaker 2>It's the same word to describe both of</v>
<v Speaker 2>those things.</v>

3186
02:20:48.360 --> 02:20:50.940
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in sensitivity is,</v>

3187
02:20:51.180 --> 02:20:54.650
<v Speaker 2>is not overt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>An aggressive racism.</v>

3188
02:20:54.740 --> 02:20:55.573
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

3189
02:20:55.910 --> 02:20:56.630
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3190
02:20:56.630 --> 02:20:58.430
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's insensitive.</v>

3191
02:20:59.300 --> 02:21:00.800
<v Speaker 2>It's insensitive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Racism.</v>

3192
02:21:01.010 --> 02:21:03.980
<v Speaker 2>Like you're not being sensitive to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>possibility that you're saying something</v>

3193
02:21:03.981 --> 02:21:06.060
<v Speaker 2>offensive or just doing something</v>
<v Speaker 2>boringly dump.</v>

3194
02:21:06.080 --> 02:21:08.360
<v Speaker 2>Now I agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The logic is more important than that</v>

3195
02:21:08.600 --> 02:21:11.080
<v Speaker 2>the nap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think you know,</v>

3196
02:21:11.090 --> 02:21:14.390
<v Speaker 2>the more aware we can all be about how</v>
<v Speaker 2>to not be a dick.</v>

3197
02:21:14.680 --> 02:21:15.513
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3198
02:21:15.570 --> 02:21:17.880
<v Speaker 3>It's like people want to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3199
02:21:17.881 --> 02:21:20.370
<v Speaker 3>you could never have all in the family</v>
<v Speaker 3>on tv today.</v>

3200
02:21:20.520 --> 02:21:23.070
<v Speaker 3>Could you imagine people would go crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3201
02:21:23.160 --> 02:21:27.060
<v Speaker 3>that's because we moved past that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's what's going on.</v>

3202
02:21:27.061 --> 02:21:30.120
<v Speaker 3>What's going on is there's a process and</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things is disturbing to</v>

3203
02:21:30.121 --> 02:21:35.121
<v Speaker 3>people about trump and what's disturbing</v>
<v Speaker 3>to people about this new freedom to mock</v>

3204
02:21:36.481 --> 02:21:40.050
<v Speaker 3>jews are appointed them as the root of</v>
<v Speaker 3>all evil and then it's much more open</v>

3205
02:21:40.051 --> 02:21:42.960
<v Speaker 3>than it's been before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that we thought we got through that</v>

3206
02:21:43.050 --> 02:21:48.050
<v Speaker 3>and then slowly but surely the</v>
<v Speaker 3>demonization of individual groups and in</v>

3207
02:21:48.871 --> 02:21:53.610
<v Speaker 3>terms of like who are the bad guys and</v>
<v Speaker 3>who are the good guys and instead having</v>

3208
02:21:53.611 --> 02:21:58.611
<v Speaker 3>it been boiled down to activities and</v>
<v Speaker 3>behaviors and individual human beings</v>

3209
02:21:58.981 --> 02:22:03.270
<v Speaker 3>that have the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not giant groups of people that believe</v>

3210
02:22:03.271 --> 02:22:06.600
<v Speaker 3>in one god versus another god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what it's been historically.</v>

3211
02:22:06.630 --> 02:22:09.750
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea is that as time goes on and as</v>

3212
02:22:09.751 --> 02:22:13.020
<v Speaker 3>people like my people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the italians become so integrated that</v>

3213
02:22:13.021 --> 02:22:16.020
<v Speaker 3>you can't be racist about us anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't work.</v>

3214
02:22:16.050 --> 02:22:16.850
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>

3215
02:22:16.850 --> 02:22:18.420
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it really doesn't work.</v>

3216
02:22:18.720 --> 02:22:20.280
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the best examples of it.</v>

3217
02:22:20.660 --> 02:22:22.730
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fascinating because there's so many</v>

3218
02:22:22.820 --> 02:22:24.470
<v Speaker 2>things that are there still and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3219
02:22:24.500 --> 02:22:26.220
<v Speaker 2>they don't have any charge or power</v>

3220
02:22:26.220 --> 02:22:27.270
<v Speaker 1>any longer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>

3221
02:22:27.271 --> 02:22:29.190
<v Speaker 1>there's so much gross behavior by</v>
<v Speaker 1>italian.</v>

3222
02:22:29.310 --> 02:22:31.990
<v Speaker 1>It just goes unchecked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3223
02:22:31.991 --> 02:22:34.530
<v Speaker 1>and I think the sopranos is probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsible for a lot of that.</v>

3224
02:22:34.560 --> 02:22:38.520
<v Speaker 1>I was in Italy last year and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>walking home real late at night and I</v>

3225
02:22:38.521 --> 02:22:41.280
<v Speaker 1>saw this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got his girlfriend up against the</v>

3226
02:22:41.281 --> 02:22:44.790
<v Speaker 1>car and he's fucking like going off on</v>
<v Speaker 1>her and I'm like this little like</v>

3227
02:22:44.940 --> 02:22:48.030
<v Speaker 1>liberal american boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like is somebody going to call the</v>

3228
02:22:48.031 --> 02:22:50.080
<v Speaker 1>police?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I kind of stood there for a</v>

3229
02:22:50.081 --> 02:22:53.290
<v Speaker 1>while longer and he's screaming in her</v>
<v Speaker 1>face and then I just look for about like</v>

3230
02:22:53.370 --> 02:22:54.270
<v Speaker 1>two or three minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

3231
02:22:54.750 --> 02:22:56.250
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is just some italian shit.</v>

3232
02:22:58.110 --> 02:23:01.610
<v Speaker 1>I just walked home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like realize like,</v>

3233
02:23:01.611 --> 02:23:02.670
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing happening here.</v>

3234
02:23:02.700 --> 02:23:03.680
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They used to.</v>

3235
02:23:03.720 --> 02:23:05.440
<v Speaker 1>That's what they used to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3236
02:23:05.460 --> 02:23:06.510
<v Speaker 1>And they still do it over there.</v>

3237
02:23:06.510 --> 02:23:08.190
<v Speaker 1>When I was over there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my driver,</v>

3238
02:23:08.191 --> 02:23:13.050
<v Speaker 1>we had this cab driver and this</v>
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker was a cartoon.</v>

3239
02:23:13.290 --> 02:23:15.420
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was driving and driving like a</v>

3240
02:23:15.421 --> 02:23:16.710
<v Speaker 1>maniac.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he would pause.</v>

3241
02:23:16.740 --> 02:23:18.840
<v Speaker 1>oh mama mia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at this girl's ass.</v>

3242
02:23:18.841 --> 02:23:21.780
<v Speaker 1>And no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Italy iS so italian.</v>

3243
02:23:21.810 --> 02:23:23.700
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are parts of how italian it is.</v>

3244
02:23:23.701 --> 02:23:27.510
<v Speaker 1>That will boggle your mind like a dude</v>
<v Speaker 1>smoking a cigarette on a vest.</v>

3245
02:23:27.511 --> 02:23:31.350
<v Speaker 1>But with a girl sitting sideways and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything is like the most italian</v>

3246
02:23:31.351 --> 02:23:32.810
<v Speaker 1>thing you could ever imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3247
02:23:32.820 --> 02:23:36.000
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's funny because I went there with my</v>

3248
02:23:36.001 --> 02:23:38.010
<v Speaker 1>family and my wife was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

02:23:38.011 --> 02:23:42.480
<v Speaker 1>so this is where you get your shit for</v>
<v Speaker 1>like from a group of eight people.</v>

3250
02:23:42.570 --> 02:23:44.790
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Italy is the best.</v>

3251
02:23:44.850 --> 02:23:46.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The best place,</v>

3252
02:23:46.530 --> 02:23:48.730
<v Speaker 1>it's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We went to the mall fee coast.</v>

3253
02:23:49.340 --> 02:23:50.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm all for incredible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so good.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's insane.</v>

3256
02:23:53.581 --> 02:23:56.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean Italy is like a jewel box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just everything.</v>

3257
02:23:56.760 --> 02:23:59.250
<v Speaker 1>any further into it you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The more pretty good heard.</v>

3258
02:23:59.251 --> 02:24:01.480
<v Speaker 1>CecIly is really beautiful too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never went on.</v>

3259
02:24:01.490 --> 02:24:04.920
<v Speaker 1>I haven't even either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went up to tuscany and I drove all</v>

3260
02:24:04.921 --> 02:24:08.910
<v Speaker 1>through there and me and natasha found</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this bath cities,</v>

3261
02:24:09.330 --> 02:24:11.500
<v Speaker 1>these cities where the romans would come</v>
<v Speaker 1>to bay.</v>

3262
02:24:11.501 --> 02:24:12.271
<v Speaker 1>Then it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3263
02:24:12.271 --> 02:24:15.330
<v Speaker 1>every time italian city has like a town</v>
<v Speaker 1>square,</v>

3264
02:24:15.870 --> 02:24:20.870
<v Speaker 1>this had a town pool in the center of it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was so cool and weird and there</v>

3265
02:24:21.001 --> 02:24:25.680
<v Speaker 1>was this big old mountain like mound of</v>
<v Speaker 1>sulphuric residue.</v>

3266
02:24:25.681 --> 02:24:30.681
<v Speaker 1>This like soft white mountain gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>called theosophy fossil bianco and it's</v>

3267
02:24:30.871 --> 02:24:33.220
<v Speaker 1>just big white mountain of like soft,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chalky,</v>

3268
02:24:33.240 --> 02:24:35.370
<v Speaker 1>sulphuric residue that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3269
02:24:35.410 --> 02:24:39.810
<v Speaker 1>the like the soda water has been fallen</v>
<v Speaker 1>on it for so long that it's carved these</v>

3270
02:24:39.811 --> 02:24:43.050
<v Speaker 1>pools into it and they're like little</v>
<v Speaker 1>hot tubs that you can get into on this</v>

3271
02:24:43.051 --> 02:24:45.510
<v Speaker 1>mountain and italy's bananas.</v>

3272
02:24:45.540 --> 02:24:48.360
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We wanted to go to,</v>

3273
02:24:48.361 --> 02:24:50.490
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the place where the volcano went</v>

3274
02:24:50.491 --> 02:24:52.740
<v Speaker 1>off and everybody does stromboli oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a pump,</v>

3275
02:24:52.741 --> 02:24:55.620
<v Speaker 1>a pump a I wanted to go to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we never got around to it.</v>

3276
02:24:55.621 --> 02:24:57.570
<v Speaker 1>I thought that would have been</v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating to see what these people</v>

3277
02:24:57.571 --> 02:25:01.710
<v Speaker 1>just hanging out and all of a sudden</v>
<v Speaker 1>lava and ash covered everybody and</v>

3278
02:25:01.711 --> 02:25:03.600
<v Speaker 1>they've frozen their tracks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Died.</v>

3279
02:25:03.601 --> 02:25:06.150
<v Speaker 1>Their pumping is a wild place for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3280
02:25:06.210 --> 02:25:08.790
<v Speaker 1>It's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also interesting to go to europe</v>

3281
02:25:08.791 --> 02:25:10.800
<v Speaker 1>because you realize how old everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

3282
02:25:11.280 --> 02:25:11.820
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

3283
02:25:11.820 --> 02:25:14.220
<v Speaker 1>this culture's been around for thousands</v>
<v Speaker 1>of years here.</v>

3284
02:25:14.280 --> 02:25:16.740
<v Speaker 1>Will brings us back to the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the roman empire.</v>

3285
02:25:16.920 --> 02:25:19.780
<v Speaker 1>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at the artifice,</v>

3286
02:25:20.400 --> 02:25:24.610
<v Speaker 1>the residue of the all the hugest</v>
<v Speaker 1>society</v>

3287
02:25:24.610 --> 02:25:26.760
<v Speaker 5>that has ever existed mean the coliseum</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

3288
02:25:26.820 --> 02:25:30.490
<v Speaker 5>they made.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They killed so many animals for sport.</v>

3289
02:25:30.520 --> 02:25:35.520
<v Speaker 5>They put certain animals out of business</v>
<v Speaker 5>like they extincted some animals.</v>

3290
02:25:35.980 --> 02:25:37.630
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 5>which ones?</v>

3291
02:25:37.690 --> 02:25:38.860
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't,</v>

3292
02:25:38.890 --> 02:25:42.340
<v Speaker 5>they don't have them anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 5>But like certain kinds of animals that</v>

3293
02:25:42.341 --> 02:25:43.600
<v Speaker 5>they would important,</v>
<v Speaker 5>important,</v>

3294
02:25:43.601 --> 02:25:44.350
<v Speaker 5>important.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're just like,</v>

3295
02:25:44.350 --> 02:25:46.450
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we killed them all just for sport.</v>

3296
02:25:46.530 --> 02:25:49.720
<v Speaker 5>It's not for any other reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When we were in the coliseum,</v>

3297
02:25:49.721 --> 02:25:51.850
<v Speaker 5>they were explaining where the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3298
02:25:52.090 --> 02:25:54.880
<v Speaker 5>they had those elevators.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It would take the animals up from the</v>

3299
02:25:54.881 --> 02:25:58.750
<v Speaker 5>ground floor and open the floor up and</v>
<v Speaker 5>then the animals would pop through and</v>

3300
02:25:58.751 --> 02:26:01.510
<v Speaker 5>they would do battle with them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they were talking about how they had</v>

3301
02:26:01.511 --> 02:26:05.590
<v Speaker 5>to raise up the side of the fences</v>
<v Speaker 5>because the lower levels,</v>

3302
02:26:05.591 --> 02:26:07.450
<v Speaker 5>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the rich people sat larry and they</v>

3303
02:26:07.451 --> 02:26:08.800
<v Speaker 5>were getting jacked by lions.</v>

3304
02:26:09.220 --> 02:26:13.000
<v Speaker 5>The lions figured out how to jump up and</v>
<v Speaker 5>get the people that were at the top.</v>

3305
02:26:13.001 --> 02:26:14.770
<v Speaker 5>Fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We needed to get some lines back to get</v>

3306
02:26:14.771 --> 02:26:17.110
<v Speaker 5>those billionaires with their yachts and</v>
<v Speaker 5>just eat them.</v>

3307
02:26:17.880 --> 02:26:19.090
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How much money do you have to have to</v>

3308
02:26:19.570 --> 02:26:22.120
<v Speaker 5>put one point $5.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Billion of it into a boat.</v>

3309
02:26:22.450 --> 02:26:24.550
<v Speaker 5>So crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had a friend who bought a boat for</v>

3310
02:26:24.551 --> 02:26:27.760
<v Speaker 5>like $60,000 and he took her for one</v>
<v Speaker 5>ride,</v>

3311
02:26:27.790 --> 02:26:30.220
<v Speaker 5>crashed into the pier,</v>
<v Speaker 5>put it in the garage for two years and</v>

3312
02:26:30.221 --> 02:26:33.880
<v Speaker 5>then sold it for 20,000.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he took a $40,000 boat ride.</v>

3313
02:26:34.050 --> 02:26:35.680
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>jesus christ.</v>

3314
02:26:36.280 --> 02:26:37.120
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what they say,</v>

3315
02:26:37.121 --> 02:26:40.300
<v Speaker 5>it's a hole in the water where you pour</v>
<v Speaker 5>money into right now,</v>

3316
02:26:40.540 --> 02:26:45.540
<v Speaker 5>but if you like to fish it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The cool thing about boats is that when</v>

3317
02:26:45.881 --> 02:26:46.361
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

3318
02:26:46.361 --> 02:26:47.650
<v Speaker 5>if you save,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have something,</v>

3319
02:26:47.651 --> 02:26:49.810
<v Speaker 5>you'd go out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>marina del rey in,</v>

3320
02:26:49.930 --> 02:26:51.520
<v Speaker 5>you just go out into the water.</v>

3321
02:26:51.940 --> 02:26:53.980
<v Speaker 5>You could kind of go wherever the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 5>you want.</v>

3322
02:26:54.310 --> 02:26:55.960
<v Speaker 5>Like there's no road.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

3323
02:26:55.990 --> 02:26:58.200
<v Speaker 5>But you can go where it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

3324
02:26:58.201 --> 02:27:02.230
<v Speaker 5>it's all water so you can go left and</v>
<v Speaker 5>right and as long as you don't hit an</v>

3325
02:27:02.231 --> 02:27:04.630
<v Speaker 5>island you can kind of do whatever the</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck you want.</v>

3326
02:27:04.660 --> 02:27:06.520
<v Speaker 5>Did you see that maiden voyage</v>
<v Speaker 5>documentary?</v>

3327
02:27:06.610 --> 02:27:10.720
<v Speaker 5>Was that it's about this 14 year old or</v>
<v Speaker 5>16 year old girl that sales around the</v>

3328
02:27:10.721 --> 02:27:12.190
<v Speaker 5>world by herself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

3329
02:27:12.191 --> 02:27:14.100
<v Speaker 5>I heard about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So interesting.</v>

3330
02:27:14.110 --> 02:27:17.680
<v Speaker 5>Who the fuck are her parents?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean there are some northern european</v>

3331
02:27:17.710 --> 02:27:20.100
<v Speaker 5>danish,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like previous events,</v>

3332
02:27:20.210 --> 02:27:22.480
<v Speaker 5>white people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>white people that don't have poverty.</v>

3333
02:27:22.510 --> 02:27:25.650
<v Speaker 5>That's</v>
<v Speaker 5>poverty.</v>

3334
02:27:25.760 --> 02:27:28.270
<v Speaker 5>I mentioned that call when you land,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you should get some poverty.</v>

3335
02:27:28.271 --> 02:27:30.430
<v Speaker 5>Actually that'll give you a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 5>more to do with your life.</v>

3336
02:27:30.550 --> 02:27:32.710
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you gotta think that the negative</v>

3337
02:27:32.711 --> 02:27:37.210
<v Speaker 5>aspects of certain societies do create</v>
<v Speaker 5>some sort of a rebound effect from those</v>

3338
02:27:37.211 --> 02:27:38.050
<v Speaker 5>negative aspects.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3339
02:27:38.051 --> 02:27:39.640
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They didn't make rock and roll in</v>

3340
02:27:39.641 --> 02:27:42.070
<v Speaker 5>Sweden.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They didn't make hip hop and fucking</v>

3341
02:27:42.071 --> 02:27:43.270
<v Speaker 5>Denmark.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>

3342
02:27:43.390 --> 02:27:47.260
<v Speaker 5>They didn't make all these like</v>
<v Speaker 5>vaudeville and standup comedy.</v>

3343
02:27:47.290 --> 02:27:50.790
<v Speaker 5>I mean this all came from people of</v>
<v Speaker 5>oppression and that's why about</v>

3344
02:27:50.800 --> 02:27:51.790
<v Speaker 5>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3345
02:27:51.791 --> 02:27:55.120
<v Speaker 5>I mean thinking about like you growing</v>
<v Speaker 5>up with a deaf mom being poor and all</v>

3346
02:27:55.121 --> 02:27:59.410
<v Speaker 5>that craziness that you went through and</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're a kid like that kind of all that.</v>

3347
02:28:01.970 --> 02:28:05.020
<v Speaker 5>It pushes something through.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's totally true.</v>

3348
02:28:05.380 --> 02:28:06.101
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't.</v>

3349
02:28:06.101 --> 02:28:09.010
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't go back and have been raised.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are rich with normal parents?</v>

3350
02:28:09.011 --> 02:28:10.420
<v Speaker 5>Not for a million dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No way.</v>

3351
02:28:10.480 --> 02:28:11.830
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not now.</v>

3352
02:28:11.890 --> 02:28:14.560
<v Speaker 5>Once you've already done it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I w I wouldn't have wanted it to</v>

3353
02:28:14.561 --> 02:28:17.620
<v Speaker 5>have been done in a different way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like the trauma will also,</v>

3354
02:28:17.621 --> 02:28:20.710
<v Speaker 5>you know that you made you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well a lot of people helped you,</v>

3355
02:28:20.800 --> 02:28:23.750
<v Speaker 5>but you made yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whereas if your parents were trump,</v>

3356
02:28:24.620 --> 02:28:27.380
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or your parents were the rockefellers or</v>

3357
02:28:27.381 --> 02:28:30.620
<v Speaker 5>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they gave you this monthly stipend.</v>

3358
02:28:31.360 --> 02:28:32.540
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck man.</v>

3359
02:28:32.600 --> 02:28:34.460
<v Speaker 5>Who are you then?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who is trump?</v>

3360
02:28:34.461 --> 02:28:36.530
<v Speaker 5>He's the same.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's the same version.</v>

3361
02:28:37.070 --> 02:28:40.610
<v Speaker 5>He started from nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean he started from $2 million from 2</v>

3362
02:28:40.610 --> 02:28:43.700
<v Speaker 5>million bucks from his father who was</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the richest people in upstate New</v>

3363
02:28:43.700 --> 02:28:44.660
<v Speaker 5>York.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And now who is he?</v>

3364
02:28:44.900 --> 02:28:47.810
<v Speaker 5>Is he.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is he like when the lights are off?</v>

3365
02:28:47.810 --> 02:28:51.020
<v Speaker 5>I wish I could have a fucking a feed of</v>
<v Speaker 5>trump's brain.</v>

3366
02:28:51.021 --> 02:28:53.150
<v Speaker 5>When the lights go down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's probably chaos.</v>

3367
02:28:53.210 --> 02:28:54.440
<v Speaker 5>What is he thinking?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is he like,</v>

3368
02:28:54.441 --> 02:28:55.730
<v Speaker 5>I'm killing it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or is he like,</v>

3369
02:28:55.731 --> 02:28:58.280
<v Speaker 5>what have I done?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think there's got to be both.</v>

3370
02:28:58.400 --> 02:29:00.650
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's got to be a.</v>

3371
02:29:00.710 --> 02:29:01.550
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he doesn't drink.</v>

3372
02:29:01.590 --> 02:29:02.670
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't do drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3373
02:29:02.900 --> 02:29:06.350
<v Speaker 5>And I think there's got to be a part of</v>
<v Speaker 5>his brain that's pushing down the what</v>

3374
02:29:06.351 --> 02:29:09.050
<v Speaker 5>have I done?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And reinforcing,</v>

3375
02:29:09.051 --> 02:29:12.380
<v Speaker 5>doubling down on the I'm the greatest.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm the best.</v>

3376
02:29:12.770 --> 02:29:14.480
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's why I kept saying about his</v>

3377
02:29:14.481 --> 02:29:17.120
<v Speaker 5>inauguration.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Numbers are so many people were there</v>

3378
02:29:17.121 --> 02:29:20.120
<v Speaker 5>and even when they told him that it</v>
<v Speaker 5>wasn't the case,</v>

3379
02:29:20.121 --> 02:29:22.610
<v Speaker 5>he fought it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then when he kept parenting,</v>

3380
02:29:22.790 --> 02:29:26.000
<v Speaker 5>not just parenting to friends but doing</v>
<v Speaker 5>it to the news,</v>

3381
02:29:26.001 --> 02:29:30.290
<v Speaker 5>doing it to the press that he got the</v>
<v Speaker 5>largest number of electoral college</v>

3382
02:29:30.291 --> 02:29:31.124
<v Speaker 5>votes.</v>

3383
02:29:31.370 --> 02:29:34.670
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's psychedelic narcissism.</v>

3384
02:29:34.850 --> 02:29:38.090
<v Speaker 5>It's like it's so far out there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It starts to seem like,</v>

3385
02:29:38.690 --> 02:29:41.150
<v Speaker 5>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're bending reality and actually is</v>

3386
02:29:41.151 --> 02:29:42.590
<v Speaker 5>bending reality.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's done.</v>

3387
02:29:42.830 --> 02:29:47.570
<v Speaker 5>He's done a fascinating job of just</v>
<v Speaker 5>making people not know what's real</v>

3388
02:29:47.571 --> 02:29:50.930
<v Speaker 5>anymore and no one knows what's real</v>
<v Speaker 5>anymore and Syria as the ultimate</v>

3389
02:29:50.931 --> 02:29:53.840
<v Speaker 5>example because it's unclear what</v>
<v Speaker 5>Israel.</v>

3390
02:29:53.841 --> 02:29:56.150
<v Speaker 5>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no one knows what the right thing to do</v>

3391
02:29:56.151 --> 02:29:58.100
<v Speaker 5>is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who are we attacking and why?</v>

3392
02:29:58.101 --> 02:30:00.420
<v Speaker 5>What are we trying to stop?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You sent bombs,</v>

3393
02:30:00.421 --> 02:30:03.740
<v Speaker 5>so the people that are fighting isis to</v>
<v Speaker 5>fight those people from doing chemical</v>

3394
02:30:03.741 --> 02:30:06.860
<v Speaker 5>warfare on their own people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then we also were fighting isis with</v>

3395
02:30:06.861 --> 02:30:08.960
<v Speaker 5>them and then it's just the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're just like,</v>

3396
02:30:09.020 --> 02:30:13.130
<v Speaker 5>I give up you ron.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Paul was saying that the chemical attack</v>

3397
02:30:13.131 --> 02:30:16.970
<v Speaker 5>doesn't make sense,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so certain certain republicans are</v>

3398
02:30:16.971 --> 02:30:18.410
<v Speaker 5>actually looking at ms dot ron paul.</v>

3399
02:30:18.410 --> 02:30:20.720
<v Speaker 5>Technically republicans more libertarian</v>
<v Speaker 5>than anything,</v>

3400
02:30:21.020 --> 02:30:23.230
<v Speaker 5>but they're looking at it and saying</v>
<v Speaker 5>like this.</v>

3401
02:30:23.380 --> 02:30:25.700
<v Speaker 5>This might not even been real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3402
02:30:25.970 --> 02:30:28.700
<v Speaker 5>I just.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I heard this great thing about how no</v>

3403
02:30:28.701 --> 02:30:31.520
<v Speaker 5>one in Israel believes that rabin was</v>
<v Speaker 5>killed by yigal amir,</v>

3404
02:30:31.521 --> 02:30:33.460
<v Speaker 5>the jewish guy like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>

3405
02:30:33.530 --> 02:30:37.820
<v Speaker 5>they believe in that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Basically hearing a conspiracy theory</v>

3406
02:30:37.821 --> 02:30:42.821
<v Speaker 5>that widely believed in a country that</v>
<v Speaker 5>isn't my own made me realize how wildly</v>

3407
02:30:43.880 --> 02:30:46.100
<v Speaker 5>desperate for conspiracy theory everyone</v>
<v Speaker 5>is.</v>

3408
02:30:46.700 --> 02:30:48.320
<v Speaker 5>Like somehow the distance where it was</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

3409
02:30:48.321 --> 02:30:48.851
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's Israel.</v>

3410
02:30:48.851 --> 02:30:50.690
<v Speaker 5>It's not really me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Made me go like,</v>

3411
02:30:50.720 --> 02:30:52.010
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is so interesting.</v>

3412
02:30:52.011 --> 02:30:56.030
<v Speaker 5>Like everybody wants to believe it</v>
<v Speaker 5>wasn't one hour until they were saying</v>

3413
02:30:56.031 --> 02:30:58.850
<v Speaker 5>that the chemical attack by assad was</v>
<v Speaker 5>not real.</v>

3414
02:30:58.851 --> 02:31:02.030
<v Speaker 5>Even though assad has done gas based</v>
<v Speaker 5>chemical attacks on his own people</v>

3415
02:31:02.031 --> 02:31:06.080
<v Speaker 5>before and his father did before him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Somehow this one was like,</v>

3416
02:31:06.450 --> 02:31:06.760
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3417
02:31:06.760 --> 02:31:07.593
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is fake.</v>

3418
02:31:07.820 --> 02:31:10.300
<v Speaker 5>It might be fake.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what's so crazy and mind bend</v>

3419
02:31:10.301 --> 02:31:13.460
<v Speaker 5>day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It might be fake and yet I don't buy any</v>

3420
02:31:13.461 --> 02:31:16.160
<v Speaker 5>conspiracy theories anymore because I</v>
<v Speaker 5>know how desperate people are to believe</v>

3421
02:31:16.161 --> 02:31:16.641
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3422
02:31:16.641 --> 02:31:19.980
<v Speaker 5>this was the same scenario that led</v>
<v Speaker 5>obama</v>

3423
02:31:19.980 --> 02:31:24.420
<v Speaker 1>to make that speech saying that we need</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go into Syria and the whole american</v>

3424
02:31:24.421 --> 02:31:27.540
<v Speaker 1>people went fuck that because we were</v>
<v Speaker 1>deep in the Iraq war,</v>

3425
02:31:27.541 --> 02:31:30.380
<v Speaker 1>deepen the Afghanistan war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that was when this,</v>

3426
02:31:30.530 --> 02:31:35.530
<v Speaker 1>I think that was 2013 or 14,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but trump made quotes.</v>

3427
02:31:35.810 --> 02:31:40.140
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy that he tweeted like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does the us have to gain for going</v>

3428
02:31:40.141 --> 02:31:42.600
<v Speaker 1>into Syria?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should be America first and then</v>

3429
02:31:42.660 --> 02:31:47.090
<v Speaker 1>winds up acting almost instantaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It happens.</v>

3430
02:31:47.100 --> 02:31:48.870
<v Speaker 1>People keep dropping these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>

3431
02:31:48.871 --> 02:31:53.430
<v Speaker 1>this bombs at trump's feet like he cares</v>
<v Speaker 1>about intellectual coherence or</v>

3432
02:31:53.431 --> 02:31:54.630
<v Speaker 1>hypocrisy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't care.</v>

3433
02:31:54.780 --> 02:31:58.140
<v Speaker 1>He's a fucking brat trapped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's trapped in a corner of a maze and</v>

3434
02:31:58.141 --> 02:31:59.970
<v Speaker 1>he's going like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck do I do?</v>

3435
02:32:00.050 --> 02:32:00.790
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just do this.</v>

3436
02:32:00.790 --> 02:32:02.190
<v Speaker 1>It's so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so transparent,</v>

3437
02:32:02.191 --> 02:32:07.170
<v Speaker 1>like 35 percent approval rating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything is collapsing under your own</v>

3438
02:32:07.171 --> 02:32:08.790
<v Speaker 1>weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have the house and the senate and</v>

3439
02:32:08.791 --> 02:32:09.780
<v Speaker 1>you can't get anything done.</v>

3440
02:32:09.930 --> 02:32:11.550
<v Speaker 1>No one likes you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're the worst,</v>

3441
02:32:11.610 --> 02:32:15.210
<v Speaker 1>so what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You fucking make something explode.</v>

3442
02:32:15.270 --> 02:32:18.960
<v Speaker 1>It's just such a terrible recipe of</v>
<v Speaker 1>something actually goes wrong.</v>

3443
02:32:18.990 --> 02:32:22.170
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Syria as a minor issue.</v>

3444
02:32:22.230 --> 02:32:23.860
<v Speaker 1>No one died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally bomb.</v>

3445
02:32:23.861 --> 02:32:26.210
<v Speaker 1>Some airfields.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They ruined some.</v>

3446
02:32:26.500 --> 02:32:27.950
<v Speaker 1>Some ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

3447
02:32:27.970 --> 02:32:32.520
<v Speaker 1>Ruined some air ships planes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what happens if something really</v>

3448
02:32:32.521 --> 02:32:35.190
<v Speaker 1>goes down and that guy is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the figurehead,</v>

3449
02:32:35.370 --> 02:32:40.320
<v Speaker 1>that is the difference between the roman</v>
<v Speaker 1>empire and this empire is that the roman</v>

3450
02:32:40.321 --> 02:32:45.090
<v Speaker 1>empire didn't have the power to press a</v>
<v Speaker 1>button and destroy like half the</v>

3451
02:32:45.091 --> 02:32:48.390
<v Speaker 1>countries on earth and we do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the scary part.</v>

3452
02:32:50.150 --> 02:32:52.200
<v Speaker 1>Come to the comedy store that saturday</v>
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3467
02:33:27.240 --> 02:33:30.060
<v Speaker 1>basically it's a theme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every week is a theme of some of the,</v>

3468
02:33:30.390 --> 02:33:30.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3469
02:33:30.970 --> 02:33:32.820
<v Speaker 1>the undercurrents of society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking,</v>

3470
02:33:32.850 --> 02:33:34.800
<v Speaker 1>we're not talking politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about like the,</v>

3471
02:33:34.950 --> 02:33:37.080
<v Speaker 1>the tectonic plates underneath them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3472
02:33:37.081 --> 02:33:40.380
<v Speaker 1>so cultural appropriation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the internet is changing our brain,</v>

3473
02:33:40.410 --> 02:33:41.940
<v Speaker 1>the dark web,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these kind of like,</v>

3474
02:33:42.180 --> 02:33:43.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the fun stuff that you'd like</v>

3475
02:33:43.981 --> 02:33:44.980
<v Speaker 1>to go to to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3476
02:33:45.030 --> 02:33:46.530
<v Speaker 1>just these big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big concept,</v>

3477
02:33:46.531 --> 02:33:47.364
<v Speaker 1>big ideas.</v>

3478
02:33:47.490 --> 02:33:49.410
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a talk show where.</v>

3479
02:33:49.520 --> 02:33:51.320
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other cool thing is it's very</v>

3480
02:33:51.360 --> 02:33:53.640
<v Speaker 1>donahue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we'd go out into the audience and let</v>

3481
02:33:53.641 --> 02:33:57.210
<v Speaker 1>people ask questions and get on up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>say their piece.</v>

3482
02:33:57.211 --> 02:33:59.790
<v Speaker 1>And so you do it in front of a live</v>
<v Speaker 1>crowd from the live audience.</v>

3483
02:33:59.850 --> 02:34:03.120
<v Speaker 1>And so some of it's done in the field</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you bring it back and show it</v>

3484
02:34:03.121 --> 02:34:04.160
<v Speaker 1>to the audience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>

3485
02:34:04.170 --> 02:34:06.420
<v Speaker 1>so like we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this week we're,</v>

3486
02:34:06.480 --> 02:34:07.980
<v Speaker 1>we're doing the how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3487
02:34:08.040 --> 02:34:10.620
<v Speaker 1>how technology is changing us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have this guy nick carr that wrote</v>

3488
02:34:10.621 --> 02:34:14.580
<v Speaker 1>the shallows on and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a couple of comedians to make</v>

3489
02:34:14.581 --> 02:34:18.010
<v Speaker 1>it fun and funny and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically,</v>

3490
02:34:18.090 --> 02:34:20.500
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every week as a different topic and a,</v>

3491
02:34:20.620 --> 02:34:23.230
<v Speaker 2>and we ask a question and hopefully we</v>
<v Speaker 2>get to the bottom of it.</v>

3492
02:34:23.620 --> 02:34:25.630
<v Speaker 2>Did you come on sometimes though?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will love to.</v>

3493
02:34:25.800 --> 02:34:27.580
<v Speaker 2>What do you want me to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know yet.</v>

3494
02:34:28.120 --> 02:34:29.020
<v Speaker 2>What do you think you would?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3495
02:34:29.021 --> 02:34:31.040
<v Speaker 2>I'll send you some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll send you all the topics and we'll</v>

3496
02:34:31.870 --> 02:34:32.650
<v Speaker 2>figure something out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3497
02:34:32.650 --> 02:34:33.311
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3498
02:34:33.311 --> 02:34:33.761
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3499
02:34:33.761 --> 02:34:34.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's perfect for,</v>

3500
02:34:34.900 --> 02:34:37.660
<v Speaker 2>it's perfect for people that like this</v>
<v Speaker 2>show because it's like real</v>

3501
02:34:37.661 --> 02:34:40.330
<v Speaker 2>conversations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like it's an actual.</v>

3502
02:34:40.331 --> 02:34:42.240
<v Speaker 2>I think people are desperate for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's,</v>

3503
02:34:42.600 --> 02:34:44.590
<v Speaker 2>I think you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were actually kind of ahead of the</v>

3504
02:34:44.591 --> 02:34:48.550
<v Speaker 2>curve on the real conversation thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think people are like podcasts in</v>

3505
02:34:48.551 --> 02:34:50.950
<v Speaker 2>general are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's so interesting that we are</v>

3506
02:34:50.951 --> 02:34:55.420
<v Speaker 2>simultaneously like making technology</v>
<v Speaker 2>and entertainment shorter and shorter</v>

3507
02:34:55.421 --> 02:34:59.500
<v Speaker 2>and shorter and shorter and there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like your show where there like</v>

3508
02:34:59.620 --> 02:35:02.260
<v Speaker 2>two hour episodes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like at the same time people are</v>

3509
02:35:02.261 --> 02:35:04.270
<v Speaker 2>driven to distraction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're also like trying to.</v>

3510
02:35:04.570 --> 02:35:07.210
<v Speaker 2>They're desperate to get some depth and</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3511
02:35:07.270 --> 02:35:09.850
<v Speaker 2>hopefully this will will find.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it just fills a different,</v>

3512
02:35:10.260 --> 02:35:12.990
<v Speaker 2>a different void that's a</v>

3513
02:35:13.200 --> 02:35:16.680
<v Speaker 3>available in entertainment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially when people are driving.</v>

3514
02:35:16.740 --> 02:35:18.180
<v Speaker 3>Like if you're driving for long periods</v>
<v Speaker 3>of time,</v>

3515
02:35:18.181 --> 02:35:20.070
<v Speaker 3>which a lot of people listen to this</v>
<v Speaker 3>right now are doing,</v>

3516
02:35:20.340 --> 02:35:21.300
<v Speaker 3>hi everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How you doing?</v>

3517
02:35:21.301 --> 02:35:25.650
<v Speaker 3>Drivers tune in if you're on a plane</v>
<v Speaker 3>flight and it's going to take you 14</v>

3518
02:35:25.651 --> 02:35:27.600
<v Speaker 3>hours,</v>
<v Speaker 3>downloaded a bunch of podcasts.</v>

3519
02:35:28.050 --> 02:35:30.540
<v Speaker 3>That stuff is the best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you can just sit there and</v>

3520
02:35:30.541 --> 02:35:35.080
<v Speaker 3>chill and it allows you to enrich your</v>
<v Speaker 3>mind because you,</v>

3521
02:35:35.130 --> 02:35:39.500
<v Speaker 3>you listen to these conversations and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you feel like you're there and you,</v>

3522
02:35:39.501 --> 02:35:44.501
<v Speaker 3>you also know this is like the thinnest</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of organization available as bare</v>

3523
02:35:46.591 --> 02:35:48.510
<v Speaker 3>bones as it gets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is leanne.</v>

3524
02:35:48.610 --> 02:35:49.443
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

3525
02:35:49.790 --> 02:35:51.340
<v Speaker 2>that's the part of it's beauty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's,</v>

3526
02:35:51.341 --> 02:35:55.190
<v Speaker 2>and that's the difference between making</v>
<v Speaker 2>a show and podcasts and podcasts and</v>

3527
02:35:55.191 --> 02:35:59.200
<v Speaker 2>it's awesome because you can find the</v>
<v Speaker 2>colonel in minute 48 and you're like,</v>

3528
02:35:59.201 --> 02:36:00.070
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found what that</v>

3529
02:36:00.380 --> 02:36:01.930
<v Speaker 3>it was about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we've done a couple of times in</v>

3530
02:36:01.931 --> 02:36:04.480
<v Speaker 3>this conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go back to things and see how they're</v>

3531
02:36:04.481 --> 02:36:07.000
<v Speaker 3>connected,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we don't have an executive standing</v>

3532
02:36:07.001 --> 02:36:09.610
<v Speaker 3>over our shoulder telling us to hit all</v>
<v Speaker 3>the data points.</v>

3533
02:36:09.760 --> 02:36:11.710
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I hopefully,</v>

3534
02:36:11.711 --> 02:36:13.660
<v Speaker 2>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy central has been,</v>

3535
02:36:13.690 --> 02:36:15.310
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not just saying this is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>company man,</v>

3536
02:36:15.311 --> 02:36:18.490
<v Speaker 2>they've been cool about saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go get weird.</v>

3537
02:36:18.520 --> 02:36:19.780
<v Speaker 2>They kind of have to know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

3538
02:36:19.781 --> 02:36:20.650
<v Speaker 2>I totally agree.</v>

3539
02:36:20.870 --> 02:36:22.550
<v Speaker 3>They're locked into the spot like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my god,</v>

<v Speaker 3>which is the best.</v>

3543
02:36:28.280 --> 02:36:31.040

<v Speaker 3>which is a monster and they don't have</v>

<v Speaker 2>when a comic had a show,</v>

3558
02:36:52.691 --> 02:36:53.920
<v Speaker 2>it was a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

02:36:53.921 --> 02:36:56.980
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

3560
02:36:56.981 --> 02:37:00.730
<v Speaker 2>comic doing like a doing a comedy</v>
<v Speaker 2>central presents or,</v>

<v Speaker 2>or premium blend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3562
02:37:02.260 --> 02:37:04.930
<v Speaker 2>it's like the same equation and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>young comics are so funny because</v>

3563
02:37:04.931 --> 02:37:07.180
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they think they deserve a show and it's</v>

3569
02:37:17.810 --> 02:37:19.880
<v Speaker 2>It definitely is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a weird time.</v>

3570
02:37:19.970 --> 02:37:21.170
<v Speaker 2>But you don't podcast too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3574
02:37:25.950 --> 02:37:28.940
<v Speaker 2>it's called the hound tall discussion</v>
<v Speaker 2>series and it's basically what led to</v>

3575
02:37:28.941 --> 02:37:32.060
<v Speaker 2>this a tv show on comedy central,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was that we were getting,</v>

3576
02:37:32.061 --> 02:37:35.710
<v Speaker 2>we get one expert on and it's in front</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a hound tall instead of the town</v>

3577
02:37:35.711 --> 02:37:36.544
<v Speaker 2>hall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3578
02:37:36.770 --> 02:37:38.690
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The little play on words that we expect</v>

3579
02:37:38.691 --> 02:37:40.900
<v Speaker 2>people to remember that no ill advise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad name.</v>

3580
02:37:41.090 --> 02:37:42.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm willing to admit that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3581
02:37:42.501 --> 02:37:44.150
<v Speaker 2>about three episodes in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said to them,</v>

3582
02:37:44.360 --> 02:37:45.260
<v Speaker 2>the listeners,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

3583
02:37:45.450 --> 02:37:47.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm willing to change his name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking that stupid.</v>

3584
02:37:47.570 --> 02:37:48.560
<v Speaker 2>They all were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3585
02:37:48.561 --> 02:37:51.080
<v Speaker 2>we like it now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>so don't listen to them in the first</v>

3586
02:37:51.081 --> 02:37:51.350
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

3587
02:37:51.350 --> 02:37:54.050
<v Speaker 2>They're the ones who are willing to</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen to it with a crazy name.</v>

3588
02:37:54.320 --> 02:37:58.440
<v Speaker 2>So we basically get an expert on and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>have that person tried to give a talk in</v>

3589
02:37:58.441 --> 02:38:00.440
<v Speaker 2>this field of expertise while comics</v>
<v Speaker 2>riff over it.</v>

3590
02:38:00.850 --> 02:38:03.030
<v Speaker 2>So it's like mystery science theater</v>
<v Speaker 2>meets a ted talk kind of.</v>

3591
02:38:03.090 --> 02:38:03.830
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3593
02:38:05.210 --> 02:38:07.490
<v Speaker 2>every.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's kind of what led to the tv</v>

3594
02:38:07.491 --> 02:38:09.800
<v Speaker 2>shows that every week is a different</v>
<v Speaker 2>topic and this is,</v>

3595
02:38:09.801 --> 02:38:12.620
<v Speaker 2>every episode is a different topic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you enjoyed doing this conversation</v>

3596

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fun.</v>

3600
02:38:17.241 --> 02:38:20.180
<v Speaker 2>conversations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's harder to have big conversations in</v>

3601
02:38:20.181 --> 02:38:21.470
<v Speaker 2>bite size,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3602
02:38:21.680 --> 02:38:22.880
<v Speaker 2>use it half,</v>
<v Speaker 2>half hour,</v>

3603
02:38:22.910 --> 02:38:25.270
<v Speaker 2>half hour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like it to get to be an hour if,</v>

3604
02:38:25.290 --> 02:38:26.270
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if all goes well,</v>

3605
02:38:26.271 --> 02:38:29.270
<v Speaker 2>I'd like that to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially when you're dealing with</v>

3606
02:38:29.271 --> 02:38:30.830
<v Speaker 2>things like cultural appropriation.</v>

3607
02:38:30.880 --> 02:38:33.770
<v Speaker 2>I know just the opposing sides,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to take more than 15</v>

3608
02:38:33.771 --> 02:38:34.640
<v Speaker 2>minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's electric,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's electric.</v>

3610
02:38:37.520 --> 02:38:40.430
<v Speaker 2>The full tapings have been really fun</v>
<v Speaker 2>and electric and then you have to</v>

3611
02:38:40.640 --> 02:38:43.580
<v Speaker 2>squeeze them into 22 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're going to be releasing a bunch</v>

3612
02:38:43.581 --> 02:38:44.550

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3617
02:38:55.100 --> 02:38:58.760
<v Speaker 2>Mc search used to have the worst talk</v>
<v Speaker 2>show in the history of the known</v>

3618
02:38:58.761 --> 02:39:03.260
<v Speaker 2>universe and it was so bad they will</v>
<v Speaker 2>play clips of it on opiod anthony and</v>

3619

<v Speaker 2>Third base.</v>

3625
02:39:14.780 --> 02:39:19.780
<v Speaker 2>He's like the original guy and we were</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking with like a 1981 white rapper</v>

3626
02:39:19.941 --> 02:39:22.250
<v Speaker 2>about cultural appropriation when it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a really cool,</v>

02:39:28.360 --> 02:39:29.193
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he went deep.</v>

02:39:29.300 --> 02:39:31.400
<v Speaker 2>He went to duke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He saId something so funny in this</v>

3631
02:39:31.401 --> 02:39:36.170
<v Speaker 2>interview I was asking is it different</v>
<v Speaker 2>that when white people appropriate just</v>

3632
02:39:36.171 --> 02:39:38.240
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about it's different</v>
<v Speaker 2>with black people appropriate versus</v>

3633
02:39:38.241 --> 02:39:40.400
<v Speaker 2>when white people appropriate and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>goes,</v>

3634
02:39:40.401 --> 02:39:41.630
<v Speaker 2>he thinks for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

3635
02:39:41.840 --> 02:39:46.840
<v Speaker 2>well white people as a whole or the</v>
<v Speaker 2>devils of society.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3638
02:39:54.291 --> 02:39:56.990
<v Speaker 2>it was just so bizarre,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but anyway,</v>

3639
02:39:57.200 --> 02:39:59.150
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3640
02:39:59.270 --> 02:40:00.103
<v Speaker 2>smart guy.</v>

3641
02:40:00.110 --> 02:40:02.390
<v Speaker 2>I think he's a very smart guy.</v>
