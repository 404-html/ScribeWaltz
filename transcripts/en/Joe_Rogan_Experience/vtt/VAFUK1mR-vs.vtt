<v Speaker 2>when someone's gone,</v>

71
00:02:40.521 --> 00:02:43.340

<v Speaker 2>when you were around them.</v>

72
00:02:43.341 --> 00:02:48.341
<v Speaker 2>You just like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even then it was never her fault.</v>

80
00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.201
<v Speaker 2>material and the whole deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And every comedian feels so </v>

81
00:03:10.201 --> 00:03:13.801
<v Speaker 2>uncomfortable working around them that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they flashed a light whenever he's in </v>

82
00:03:13.801 --> 00:03:13.801
<v Speaker 2>the room so that no one does their </v>
<v Speaker 2>material.</v>

83
00:03:13.801 --> 00:03:15.490
<v Speaker 2>And you just start working the crowd.</v>

<v Speaker 2>She always gave me good spots,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like hard fucking spots,</v>

121
00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.660
<v Speaker 2>always after dice after Martin Lawrence </v>
<v Speaker 2>after if anybody would crush,</v>

122
00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.670
<v Speaker 2>I'd gone after him after Chris Rock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after this guy,</v>

123
00:04:54.671 --> 00:04:57.390
<v Speaker 2>after that guy anyway that would crush </v>
<v Speaker 2>she.</v>

124
00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:58.860
<v Speaker 2>She liked you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She would give you the.</v>

125
00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:03.940
<v Speaker 2>The deaths spots really well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you realized that you have to.</v>

126
00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.010
<v Speaker 2>You gotta eat shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

127
00:05:06.011 --> 00:05:07.840
<v Speaker 2>You got to develop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't just have.</v>

128
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:13.040
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's an analogy with </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting like you can't just fight </v>

129
00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.050
<v Speaker 2>people that you could beat the shit out </v>
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>

130
00:05:14.051 --> 00:05:15.670
<v Speaker 2>You have to fight people that are going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to test you.</v>

131
00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:20.730
<v Speaker 2>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because otherwise you're going to </v>

132
00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:22.070
<v Speaker 2>develop like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an unrealistic sense of your abilities </v>

133
00:05:22.451 --> 00:05:26.800
<v Speaker 2>and an unrealistic sense of other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people's abilities and you have to.</v>

134
00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.530
<v Speaker 2>You have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to feel what it's like.</v>

135
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.800
<v Speaker 2>I think as an up and comic comic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you start thinking you're pretty </v>

136
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:35.350
<v Speaker 2>good and then you have to see someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>who's really good and then you go,</v>

137
00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:36.490
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm terrible.</v>

138
00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:41.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you go on after them and that </v>

139
00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.111
<v Speaker 2>feeling of just total ineptitude or you </v>
<v Speaker 2>just feel so shitty and clunky and </v>

140
00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.260
<v Speaker 2>awful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to feel that too.</v>

141
00:05:47.261 --> 00:05:49.420
<v Speaker 2>Just it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the number one motive,</v>

142
00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:52.440
<v Speaker 2>like bombing is one of the best things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that can happen to a comedian.</v>

143
00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:55.300
<v Speaker 2>That feeling of following someone great </v>
<v Speaker 2>is basically.</v>

144
00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:57.290
<v Speaker 2>It almost feels like shame,</v>

145
00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:59.340
<v Speaker 4>shame,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shame.</v>

146
00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.500
<v Speaker 4>Like someone goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

147
00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:03.590
<v Speaker 4>do you want to feel humiliated?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's fucking shame,</v>

148
00:06:03.591 --> 00:06:04.360
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

149
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:09.610
<v Speaker 4>I see it all the time too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I watched it the other day at the </v>

150
00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:09.610
<v Speaker 4>Improv.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I watched somebody bomb.</v>

151
00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:14.980
<v Speaker 4>They went on after somebody's crushed </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they just would just choking like </v>

152
00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:15.470
<v Speaker 4>right away and you just go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>woof.</v>

153
00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:16.990
<v Speaker 4>You got to reexamine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

154
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.460
<v Speaker 4>but it's a gift.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It really is.</v>

155
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:24.490
<v Speaker 4>It helps you in those moments are gifts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those moments of failure are gifts.</v>

156
00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:30.040
<v Speaker 4>They just feel like shit at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you got to realize that that like </v>

157
00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.860
<v Speaker 4>every like leap that I've made in my act</v>
<v Speaker 4>in or in my,</v>

158
00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:34.400
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>

159
00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:37.610
<v Speaker 4>my career as a comedian has come from a </v>
<v Speaker 4>humiliation,</v>

160
00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.430
<v Speaker 4>like you hit that humiliation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they go fuck.</v>

161
00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.880
<v Speaker 4>Then he come back strong in that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what everything else to totally.</v>

162
00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.120
<v Speaker 4>Because as long as you actually think </v>
<v Speaker 4>about it and try to address it.</v>

163
00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.440
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it is a,</v>

164
00:06:48.441 --> 00:06:51.920
<v Speaker 4>it's devastating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's only not helpful if you go,</v>

165
00:06:51.921 --> 00:06:56.921
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just not going to even put any </v>

166
00:06:56.921 --> 00:06:57.950
<v Speaker 4>thought into that experience at all guys</v>
<v Speaker 4>do do that.</v>

167
00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:59.960
<v Speaker 4>Of course they did lock it out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>block it out,</v>

168
00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:04.961
<v Speaker 4>block everything out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they never go anywhere and they're </v>

169
00:07:04.961 --> 00:07:04.961
<v Speaker 4>still doing the same 15.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

170
00:07:04.961 --> 00:07:07.130
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a defense mechanism.</v>

171
00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:12.300
<v Speaker 4>You get just get scared and you can sort</v>
<v Speaker 4>of just autopilot your way through some </v>

172
00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:18.440
<v Speaker 4>half ass bullshit.</v>

201
00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:27.530
<v Speaker 4>that's for pussies jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't do that anymore.</v>

202
00:08:27.531 --> 00:08:30.290
<v Speaker 4>You know that egg white thing is </v>
<v Speaker 4>bullshit.</v>

203
00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.510
<v Speaker 4>They realized that most of the protein </v>
<v Speaker 4>and.</v>

204
00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:34.700
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the whole idea was about.</v>

205
00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:38.360
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's hard to shake off old ideas when it</v>

206
00:08:38.361 --> 00:08:43.361
<v Speaker 4>comes to nutrition and the old idea was </v>
<v Speaker 4>that dietary cholesterol is bad for you,</v>

207
00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:47.690
<v Speaker 4>but it's not right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dietary cholesterol is actually good for</v>

208
00:08:47.691 --> 00:08:49.500
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It sounds crazy to hear it.</v>

209
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:50.540
<v Speaker 4>And also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>

210
00:08:50.541 --> 00:08:52.360
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know this sounds like a real simpleton</v>

211
00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:57.400
<v Speaker 4>thing to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but how do they get this shit wrong for </v>

212
00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:57.400
<v Speaker 4>so long?</v>

213
00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:57.400
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

214
00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:01.910
<v Speaker 2>It's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All we here for years and years is this </v>

215
00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:06.020
<v Speaker 2>is doctors are telling you to do this </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it feels like one day like,</v>

216
00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:07.680
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got all that shit wrong.</v>

217
00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:12.900
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can use someone like Chris crusher </v>

218
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:14.670
<v Speaker 2>or Dr Rhonda Patrick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or like Robb Wolf,</v>

219
00:09:14.671 --> 00:09:19.671
<v Speaker 2>like real nutrition experts that really </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand the way nutrients like the </v>

220
00:09:21.901 --> 00:09:25.320
<v Speaker 2>way your body absorbs them and what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's necessary,</v>

221
00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:30.360
<v Speaker 2>what's not necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What they're finding out is that first </v>

222
00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:30.360
<v Speaker 2>of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was,</v>

223
00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:34.950
<v Speaker 2>you know about the whole thing where the</v>
<v Speaker 2>sugar industry paid off scientist to say</v>

224
00:09:34.951 --> 00:09:37.050
<v Speaker 2>that saturated fat was the cause of </v>
<v Speaker 2>heart disease.</v>

225
00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:38.250
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he didn't know about that.</v>

226
00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:39.540
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in the New York Times.</v>

227
00:09:39.541 --> 00:09:41.280
<v Speaker 2>It was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In 19 fifties.</v>

228
00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:47.060
<v Speaker 2>Sugar Industry paid off scientists to </v>
<v Speaker 2>take the blame away from sugar and put </v>

229
00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:51.921
<v Speaker 2>it on saturated fat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know the sugar lobby is insanity and </v>

230
00:09:51.921 --> 00:09:54.420
<v Speaker 2>that that's the only thing we haven't </v>
<v Speaker 2>seen on the percentages of,</v>

231
00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:57.930
<v Speaker 2>of daily value is the percentage of that</v>
<v Speaker 2>sugar you're supposed to have.</v>

232
00:09:57.990 --> 00:09:58.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

233
00:09:58.651 --> 00:10:00.690
<v Speaker 2>when you see like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

234
00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:02.240
<v Speaker 2>presenting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

235
00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.140
<v Speaker 2>And then what percentage of and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>sugar,</v>

236
00:10:04.141 --> 00:10:06.640
<v Speaker 2>it'll be like 52 grams percentage </v>
<v Speaker 2>nonexistent.</v>

237
00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:11.890
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they fucked everybody up because they </v>

238
00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:13.590
<v Speaker 2>got everybody thinking that it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>saturated fat.</v>

239
00:10:13.591 --> 00:10:17.010
<v Speaker 2>That was a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's really a refined carbohydrates,</v>

240
00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:18.750
<v Speaker 2>bread,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pasta.</v>

241
00:10:18.751 --> 00:10:21.060
<v Speaker 2>Your body converts that into sugar and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then sugar itself.</v>

242
00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.530
<v Speaker 2>So there was that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was,</v>

243
00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:23.850
<v Speaker 2>you know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's also,</v>

244
00:10:23.851 --> 00:10:28.440
<v Speaker 2>there's a reality of refined </v>
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrates mixed with saturated fat.</v>

245
00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:31.290
<v Speaker 2>It's not a good combination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you mix the two of them together,</v>

246
00:10:31.291 --> 00:10:34.530
<v Speaker 2>it is not good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially for some people,</v>

247
00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:37.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different people's body bodies absorb it</v>

248
00:10:37.321 --> 00:10:40.770
<v Speaker 2>differently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you're on a high fat,</v>

249
00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:43.350
<v Speaker 2>low carb diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very important that you,</v>

250
00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:45.720
<v Speaker 2>that's how you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can cut that out.</v>

251
00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:50.760
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to go high fat and </v>
<v Speaker 2>refined carbohydrates and sugars as </v>

252
00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:50.940
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

253
00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:53.660
<v Speaker 2>It's not good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that that is like a.</v>

254
00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:57.300
<v Speaker 2>So there's a mechanism to it that Dr </v>
<v Speaker 2>Rhonda Patrick explained.</v>

255
00:10:57.301 --> 00:10:59.700
<v Speaker 2>But essentially it's just terrible for </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

256
00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:00.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I have,</v>

257
00:11:00.741 --> 00:11:05.250
<v Speaker 2>I have high fat and if I go one week </v>
<v Speaker 2>just not even go crazy.</v>

258
00:11:05.251 --> 00:11:06.150
<v Speaker 2>But just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

259
00:11:06.151 --> 00:11:11.151
<v Speaker 2>I'll have bread with this and like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in three days I'll weigh eight </v>

260
00:11:11.151 --> 00:11:13.110
<v Speaker 2>pounds more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy and I just go,</v>

261
00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:18.190
<v Speaker 2>I can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy how the weight just piles on </v>

262
00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:18.190
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

263
00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:21.760
<v Speaker 2>It's bananas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Speaking to wait bird specialist also </v>

264
00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:21.760
<v Speaker 2>coming out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Speaking a way.</v>

265
00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:21.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's coming out.</v>

266
00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:22.950
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does it have to do with weight?</v>

267
00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:25.090
<v Speaker 2>I was just saying births fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just kidding.</v>

268
00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:28.330
<v Speaker 2>I was just associating words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>attitude that.</v>

269
00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:31.650
<v Speaker 2>But I think it's considered a Hashtag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hashtag Bert is enormous.</v>

270
00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.050
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's great.</v>

271
00:11:34.051 --> 00:11:35.970
<v Speaker 2>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's also shirtless in this one.</v>

272
00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:40.430
<v Speaker 2>He took his shirt off and special.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

273
00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:44.250
<v Speaker 2>at least you'd be able to see the </v>
<v Speaker 2>background being different.</v>

274
00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:46.320
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's so crazy.</v>

275
00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:46.980
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

276
00:11:46.981 --> 00:11:49.020
<v Speaker 2>that was coming out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Netflix this summer I think.</v>

277
00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:51.720
<v Speaker 2>Does he just always take your shirt off </v>
<v Speaker 2>now?</v>

278
00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:53.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think on,</v>

279
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:54.190
<v Speaker 2>I think when it's a big,</v>

280
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:56.380
<v Speaker 3>like a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If he's doing his weekend,</v>

282
00:11:57.970 --> 00:11:59.530

<v Speaker 3>I think he's doing spots.</v>

283
00:11:59.531 --> 00:12:00.770
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't necessarily do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it,</v>

284
00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:04.580

<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

331
00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:44.230
<v Speaker 3>it was a blast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was one of the most.</v>

332
00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:48.320
<v Speaker 3>It was so much fun because I had so much</v>
<v Speaker 3>anxiety going into it.</v>

333
00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:53.370
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it was the first big show of </v>

334
00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:56.231
<v Speaker 3>new.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been doing some club weekends and </v>

335
00:13:56.231 --> 00:13:56.231
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>clubs are just different.</v>

336
00:13:56.231 --> 00:13:57.260
<v Speaker 3>They're just different and you can get </v>
<v Speaker 3>away with more,</v>

337
00:13:57.410 --> 00:14:00.800
<v Speaker 3>you can get away with more and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>more exposed in a big room.</v>

338
00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:02.930
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was like,</v>

339
00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:04.400
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the night before I was like,</v>

340
00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:08.540
<v Speaker 3>what if none of this works like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that kind of feeling,</v>

341
00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:09.650
<v Speaker 3>or I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what am I doing?</v>

342
00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:11.810
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

343
00:14:11.811 --> 00:14:14.030
<v Speaker 3>I woke up early that morning and I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>just like,</v>

344
00:14:14.031 --> 00:14:14.860
<v Speaker 3>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'll be all right now.</v>

345
00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:16.580
<v Speaker 3>You got to be fun now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be fucking terrible.</v>

346
00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:21.690
<v Speaker 3>Like I was going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was going back and forth like that on </v>

347
00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:23.330
<v Speaker 3>that show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it ended up being just utter chaos.</v>

348
00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:24.650
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were just,</v>

349
00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:26.510
<v Speaker 3>they were all about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was really fun.</v>

350
00:14:26.511 --> 00:14:27.740
<v Speaker 3>I mean I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

351
00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:32.950
<v Speaker 3>it was so much more fun because I had </v>
<v Speaker 3>that feeling of uncertainty of course.</v>

352
00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:37.500
<v Speaker 3>So that's one of the cool things about </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing a special is that like you,</v>

353
00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:43.030
<v Speaker 3>you get so introspective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you examine every bid with a microscope,</v>

354
00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:47.540
<v Speaker 3>you go over it with a fine tooth comb </v>
<v Speaker 3>for like weeks before you shoot.</v>

355
00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:49.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You start second guessing everything.</v>

356
00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:51.530
<v Speaker 3>And then that week of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that,</v>

357
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:54.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the last one I did in Denver,</v>

358
00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:59.890
<v Speaker 3>I did a show Wednesday and Thursday I </v>
<v Speaker 3>did Oakland.</v>

359
00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:06.690
<v Speaker 3>And then Friday I came into Denver,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did a midnight show at the works </v>

360
00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:09.800
<v Speaker 3>downtown and every show is different and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

361
00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:15.370
<v Speaker 3>this is terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then you know,</v>

362
00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:19.590
<v Speaker 3>and then you have those two tapings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think every.</v>

363
00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:20.690
<v Speaker 3>This.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did my,</v>

364
00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:22.130
<v Speaker 3>that was my third,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

365
00:15:22.131 --> 00:15:26.150
<v Speaker 3>I think our one and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think almost all three.</v>

366
00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:28.820
<v Speaker 3>The first taping is over and you're like</v>
<v Speaker 3>this good.</v>

367
00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:31.040
<v Speaker 3>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We could use it.</v>

368
00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:34.300
<v Speaker 3>And then every time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The second one is just</v>

369
00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:35.390
<v Speaker 2>loops.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

370
00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:37.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once you get it into camp,</v>

371
00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:40.100
<v Speaker 2>that's why I decided to do for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's smart.</v>

372
00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I feel like you do four and then</v>

373
00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:44.660
<v Speaker 2>one of them's going to be like a real </v>
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>

374
00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:45.860
<v Speaker 2>True.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

375
00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:47.690
<v Speaker 2>And the thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I've found out,</v>

376
00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:50.540
<v Speaker 2>what I've found out though is if I have </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the first one,</v>

377
00:15:50.541 --> 00:15:52.950
<v Speaker 2>turns out to be a real show because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not as.</v>

378
00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:55.330
<v Speaker 2>Not as under as much pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

379
00:15:57.850 --> 00:15:59.450
<v Speaker 2>Because if you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have two barrels,</v>

380
00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:02.850
<v Speaker 2>like you get the one done and then you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you feel like,</v>

381
00:16:02.851 --> 00:16:03.680
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got it now.</v>

382
00:16:03.681 --> 00:16:05.690
<v Speaker 2>It can be loose for the second one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you have four,</v>

383
00:16:05.691 --> 00:16:06.470
<v Speaker 2>you feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>

384
00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:11.620
<v Speaker 2>let's see what happens with this one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you could at least that's how San </v>

385
00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:12.780
<v Speaker 2>Francisco was when I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

386
00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:14.270
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fillmore.</v>

387
00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:16.820
<v Speaker 2>That's a good spy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's great spot.</v>

388
00:16:16.821 --> 00:16:19.660
<v Speaker 2>But it's a high ceiling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really excited about the Wilbert.</v>

389
00:16:19.661 --> 00:16:20.960
<v Speaker 2>Wilbert is kind of a high ceiling too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>

390
00:16:20.961 --> 00:16:22.280
<v Speaker 2>Wilbur,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked the wilburn.</v>

391
00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:27.340
<v Speaker 2>Each place has a low ceiling was three </v>
<v Speaker 2>stacks of people and then like you have </v>

392
00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:30.500
<v Speaker 2>a high ceiling and there's a high </v>
<v Speaker 2>ceiling and Bong amongst the,</v>

393
00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:33.680
<v Speaker 2>a above the front people in the very </v>
<v Speaker 2>front row.</v>

394
00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:38.800
<v Speaker 2>But it's basically the three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>300 seat comedy clubs stacked on top of </v>

395
00:16:39.051 --> 00:16:40.020
<v Speaker 2>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it's like.</v>

396
00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:42.110
<v Speaker 2>Such a great room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking amazing.</v>

397
00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:43.110
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

398
00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:43.930
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

399
00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:44.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

400
00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:49.350
<v Speaker 3>my next one will be a while from now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've already started talking about </v>

401
00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:50.630
<v Speaker 3>with my guy about how I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

402
00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:52.790
<v Speaker 3>even though on the tour I'll do some big</v>
<v Speaker 3>rooms,</v>

403
00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:58.100
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I want to go to like a 1200 </v>

404
00:16:58.100 --> 00:16:58.100
<v Speaker 3>seater that to actually shoot it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

405
00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:00.740
<v Speaker 3>I think those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are in my experience as of recent,</v>

406
00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:05.300
<v Speaker 3>that thousand to 1500 seat venue is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>most fun show.</v>

407
00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:08.720
<v Speaker 3>It's like where it's big enough where </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's crazy energy,</v>

408
00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:13.930
<v Speaker 3>but it's small enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You still kind of connect with the </v>

409
00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:13.930
<v Speaker 3>audience.</v>

410
00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:14.060
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes those big shows that are crazy</v>

411
00:17:14.061 --> 00:17:15.890
<v Speaker 2>fun too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I did 6,000</v>

412
00:17:15.891 --> 00:17:17.280
<v Speaker 2>seats in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in um,</v>

413
00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:20.150
<v Speaker 2>Dallas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck yeah.</v>

414
00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:25.450
<v Speaker 2>Me and Tony and Ian were pulling up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a big fucking traffic jam or </v>

415
00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:25.880
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God damn,</v>

416
00:17:25.881 --> 00:17:27.950
<v Speaker 2>we're all these people going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we realized,</v>

417
00:17:27.951 --> 00:17:32.951
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to the show coming to see </v>

418
00:17:32.951 --> 00:17:32.951
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

419
00:17:32.951 --> 00:17:32.951
<v Speaker 2>It was very bizarre.</v>

420
00:17:32.951 --> 00:17:34.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That place was hyped up.</v>

421
00:17:34.841 --> 00:17:39.841
<v Speaker 3>That was a lot of fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did this one theater last year and </v>

422
00:17:39.841 --> 00:17:39.970
<v Speaker 3>that was a 3000 seater.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which one is Toronto?</v>

423
00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:41.320
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've done that.</v>

424
00:17:41.321 --> 00:17:42.640
<v Speaker 3>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was a great,</v>

425
00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:44.990
<v Speaker 3>great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like for like a pretty big size.</v>

426

<v Speaker 3>I never did hall.</v>

429
00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:54.900
<v Speaker 4>Some of these places you get to work at.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like they're like museums.</v>

430
00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:56.910
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well the Tabernacle is.</v>

431
00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:58.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that we're talking about.</v>

432
00:17:58.921 --> 00:18:01.350
<v Speaker 4>I go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can you imagine if the Baptist ministers</v>

433
00:18:01.351 --> 00:18:05.070
<v Speaker 4>that used to give sermons heard what I </v>
<v Speaker 4>was saying on their stage and I like how</v>

434
00:18:05.071 --> 00:18:07.500
<v Speaker 4>upset they are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those guys.</v>

435
00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:10.290
<v Speaker 4>That's what.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was a baptist church.</v>

436
00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:15.610
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it doesn't have an Oregon behind </v>

437
00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:15.610
<v Speaker 4>her,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they still have.</v>

438
00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:15.610
<v Speaker 4>The pipes are still there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

439
00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:16.860
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Over 100 year old church.</v>

440
00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:19.140
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking amazing venue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

441
00:18:19.141 --> 00:18:20.610
<v Speaker 4>it really is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

442
00:18:20.611 --> 00:18:23.010
<v Speaker 4>We're super lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We get to work these places.</v>

443
00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:26.140
<v Speaker 4>I did the king's theater in Brooklyn </v>
<v Speaker 4>last weekend I was at.</v>

444
00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:28.590
<v Speaker 4>Oh amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's old,</v>

445
00:18:28.591 --> 00:18:30.780
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>All this fuck from the 19 hundreds,</v>

446
00:18:30.781 --> 00:18:35.781
<v Speaker 4>early 19 hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then it closed down from like 77 to </v>

447
00:18:35.781 --> 00:18:37.920
<v Speaker 4>2005.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then in 2005 they started renovating</v>

448
00:18:37.921 --> 00:18:38.010
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

449
00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:39.240
<v Speaker 4>It's a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that close,</v>

450
00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:42.060
<v Speaker 4>long time it was just sitting there and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then they,</v>

451
00:18:42.061 --> 00:18:47.061
<v Speaker 4>they took forever to renovate it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then they reopened it in 2015,</v>

452
00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:49.590
<v Speaker 4>2010.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They restarted it somewhere.</v>

453
00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:51.270
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Brooklyn,</v>

459

<v Speaker 4>Brooklyn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Stunning.</v>

461
00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:14.190
<v Speaker 4>Like the inside of it is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not totally designed for comedy.</v>

462
00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:16.860
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what's normally there were kind</v>

463
00:19:16.861 --> 00:19:18.780
<v Speaker 4>of like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I dunno bands probably.</v>

464
00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:21.000
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure some comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

465
00:19:21.001 --> 00:19:23.520
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>think Chris rock did it.</v>

466
00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:25.500
<v Speaker 4>I think some people do comedy there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>

467
00:19:25.501 --> 00:19:30.501
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they've only been doing shows </v>

468
00:19:30.501 --> 00:19:31.680

495
00:20:30.271 --> 00:20:30.540
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

496

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well you're scrambling a little busy </v>

497
00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:35.810
<v Speaker 4>scrambling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

498
00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:35.810
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's good.</v>

499
00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:36.210
<v Speaker 4>It's good man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Speaking to current events.</v>

500
00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:38.820
<v Speaker 4>Is the president going to jail?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to figure this out.</v>

501
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.220
<v Speaker 4>Is he going to jail?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It seems like.</v>

502
00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:44.040
<v Speaker 4>Seems like some serious shit is going </v>
<v Speaker 4>down.</v>

503
00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:46.880
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] it sure feels like it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

504
00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.490
<v Speaker 4>when it feels like it's really </v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting.</v>

505
00:20:48.491 --> 00:20:50.530
<v Speaker 4>It's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like you're watching a show.</v>

506
00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:52.840
<v Speaker 4>It's a really entertaining show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

507
00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:57.930
<v Speaker 4>I mean I don't mind that house of cards </v>
<v Speaker 4>is in production because this is a good </v>

508
00:20:57.930 --> 00:20:59.010
<v Speaker 4>show we're watching.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

509
00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:02.080
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's ramping up whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever is going on.</v>

510
00:21:02.081 --> 00:21:07.081
<v Speaker 4>It's like they're building towards an </v>
<v Speaker 4>event and it seems like they have been </v>

511
00:21:07.081 --> 00:21:10.921
<v Speaker 4>planning this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they're systematically attacking </v>

512
00:21:10.921 --> 00:21:13.150
<v Speaker 4>different parts of his administration,</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting people to fold,</v>

513
00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:18.480
<v Speaker 4>getting people to turn state's evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting people to to plead guilty and </v>

514
00:21:19.361 --> 00:21:20.560
<v Speaker 4>they're slowly chipping away.</v>

515
00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:22.700
<v Speaker 4>There's no way that the end result could</v>
<v Speaker 4>be like,</v>

516
00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:23.470
<v Speaker 4>eh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's it.</v>

517
00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:25.240
<v Speaker 4>We're done this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As far as we got,</v>

518
00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:28.510
<v Speaker 4>it feels like there's definitely a </v>
<v Speaker 4>shoe's going to drop.</v>

519
00:21:28.511 --> 00:21:29.170
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

520
00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:34.200
<v Speaker 4>the crazy thing is they're going to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>them for campaign financing because of </v>

521
00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:39.580
<v Speaker 4>his attorney paint off stormy Daniels.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the thing that I read,</v>

522
00:21:39.581 --> 00:21:44.581
<v Speaker 4>I could be getting this wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that it's that pay off within a </v>

523
00:21:44.581 --> 00:21:44.860
<v Speaker 4>certain number of days of the election,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

524
00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:49.890
<v Speaker 4>That starts to break a finance law.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess because they said that that </v>

525
00:21:49.890 --> 00:21:53.110
<v Speaker 4>payment was within a certain number of </v>
<v Speaker 4>days of the election.</v>

526
00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:58.140
<v Speaker 4>So what it means is that it's affecting </v>
<v Speaker 4>the election potentially,</v>

527
00:21:58.630 --> 00:21:59.440
<v Speaker 4>is what.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

528
00:21:59.441 --> 00:22:01.630
<v Speaker 4>what the accusation could be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Isn't that interesting?</v>

529
00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:06.840
<v Speaker 4>It's like you're paying someone to </v>
<v Speaker 4>affect opinion and so that's like,</v>

530
00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:10.660
<v Speaker 4>it's a campaign finance violation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

531
00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:12.600
<v Speaker 4>It's also amazing that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I dunno,</v>

532
00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:17.640
<v Speaker 4>I mean I guess at the time somebody </v>
<v Speaker 4>comes to you with that check and you're </v>

533
00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:17.640
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>

534
00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:21.030
<v Speaker 4>But in retrospect,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking how much leverage she would've </v>

535
00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:21.030
<v Speaker 4>had done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you go back then and,</v>

536
00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:23.110
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and she gets to say,</v>

537
00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:25.240
<v Speaker 4>you want me to keep this thing silent?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No problem.</v>

538
00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:29.020
<v Speaker 4>But you need to up that check.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bill O'reilly,</v>

539
00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:33.050
<v Speaker 4>Bill paid one lady 32 million.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not.</v>

540
00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:35.050
<v Speaker 4>Did he do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

541
00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:38.020
<v Speaker 4>that's not a squeezing an ass cheek.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

542
00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:40.120
<v Speaker 4>What did he do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What did he do?</v>

543
00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:42.250
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much money does he have?</v>

544
00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:43.790
<v Speaker 4>Thirty $2.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Million is like,</v>

545
00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:45.230
<v Speaker 4>just pay it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just pay it off.</v>

546
00:22:45.231 --> 00:22:46.300
<v Speaker 4>Just write it off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

547
00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:47.680
<v Speaker 4>What does that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A years our.</v>

548
00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:52.710
<v Speaker 4>They have a lot of fucking settlements.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Roger ailes and seen the bit I'm doing </v>

549
00:22:52.951 --> 00:22:54.070
<v Speaker 4>on Fox News.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

550
00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:58.480
<v Speaker 4>it's one of my favorite belly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I love doing this will be in the new </v>
<v Speaker 4>one.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I look forward to seeing you there.</v>

555
00:23:03.441 --> 00:23:06.490
<v Speaker 4>So it's such a fascinating little place </v>
<v Speaker 4>over there.</v>

556
00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:09.730
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and right now they're what they're doing</v>

557
00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:11.230
<v Speaker 4>for the most part.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not every show,</v>

558
00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:16.500
<v Speaker 4>but the show other than Tucker Carlson I</v>
<v Speaker 4>think is one of the few guys over there </v>

559
00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:20.110
<v Speaker 4>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he seems.</v>

560
00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:23.920
<v Speaker 4>He seems the most reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

561
00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:27.160
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You think he's more reasonable than like</v>

562
00:23:27.161 --> 00:23:28.960
<v Speaker 4>Shepard Smith?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

563
00:23:28.961 --> 00:23:31.990
<v Speaker 4>I never watched that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that guy is saying he has a.</v>

564
00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:37.020
<v Speaker 4>he's there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he seems to have like a little more </v>

565
00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:37.020
<v Speaker 4>back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like unbiased.</v>

566
00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:41.371
<v Speaker 4>Balanced.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They give you are doing ecstasy with </v>

567
00:23:41.371 --> 00:23:41.371
<v Speaker 4>Shepard Smith.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He tried to kiss you?</v>

568
00:23:41.371 --> 00:23:41.890
<v Speaker 4>I hope so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I've been losing weight.</v>

569
00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.860
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the</v>

570
00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:51.340
<v Speaker 3>rest of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My point is the rest of this show seems </v>

571
00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:51.890
<v Speaker 3>like state run propaganda.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's,</v>

<v Speaker 3>it's kind of fascinating,</v>

574
00:23:56.661 --> 00:24:01.661
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That it's not a secret that he has real </v>

575
00:24:01.661 --> 00:24:02.990
<v Speaker 3>relationships with multiple on air </v>

00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:34.391
<v Speaker 3>something about this shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they just did a segment on it and </v>

586
00:24:34.391 --> 00:24:37.931
<v Speaker 3>then that also throws his aids and his </v>
<v Speaker 3>staff a curve balls because there'll be </v>

587
00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:41.420
<v Speaker 3>not expecting that he's going to bring </v>
<v Speaker 3>this up,</v>

588
00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:43.850
<v Speaker 3>but he sees it on tv and there and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>they have to go like,</v>

589
00:24:43.851 --> 00:24:48.851
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course we are going to do that </v>

590
00:24:48.851 --> 00:24:48.851
<v Speaker 3>because keep him from the TV.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

591
00:24:48.851 --> 00:24:51.530
<v Speaker 3>it's fucking nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He watches a lot of cable TV.</v>

592
00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:56.680
<v Speaker 3>They say watches eight hours a day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't like to go to the office </v>

593
00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:56.680
<v Speaker 3>early and that's one of my other </v>
<v Speaker 3>favorite ones.</v>

594
00:24:56.770 --> 00:25:00.980
<v Speaker 3>Like the like John Kelly has been like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got to get here earlier.</v>

595
00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:07.060
<v Speaker 3>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said I sit out for a.</v>

596
00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:12.180
<v Speaker 3>He was showing up at 11 and that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were trying to get them to come at nine </v>

597
00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:13.640
<v Speaker 3>and then I think they settled on 10 or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

598
00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:17.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just want to get their fucking nine.</v>

599
00:25:17.541 --> 00:25:19.310
<v Speaker 3>That's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

600
00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:21.400
<v Speaker 3>It's so interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They really.</v>

601
00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:26.100
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't get us into a war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Having him as the president will be very</v>

602
00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:27.800
<v Speaker 3>beneficial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

603
00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:33.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I think that we're going to </v>

604
00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:35.021
<v Speaker 3>realize how fucking crazy it is to give </v>
<v Speaker 3>one person so much power based on a </v>

605
00:25:35.021 --> 00:25:35.920
<v Speaker 3>popularity contest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It.</v>

606
00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:40.310
<v Speaker 3>It does kind of highlight the absurdity </v>
<v Speaker 3>of not just of him of the presidency.</v>

607
00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:41.720
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Completely absurd.</v>

608
00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:46.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'd never do it that way today if we </v>

609
00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:49.031
<v Speaker 3>had no government at all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we lived in some sort of Bizarro </v>

610
00:25:49.031 --> 00:25:51.971
<v Speaker 3>universe where a government had never </v>
<v Speaker 3>been established when decided enough is </v>

611
00:25:51.971 --> 00:25:51.971
<v Speaker 3>enough.</v>

612
00:25:51.971 --> 00:25:54.380
<v Speaker 3>We can't live with anarchy anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need to have some sort of a system of</v>

613
00:25:54.381 --> 00:25:56.300
<v Speaker 3>rules,</v>
<v Speaker 3>checks and balances and put an.</v>

614
00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:57.530
<v Speaker 3>We never say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

615
00:25:57.531 --> 00:26:00.710
<v Speaker 3>let's have a popularity contest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See One dude,</v>

616
00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:05.660
<v Speaker 3>and let's let them get financed by giant</v>
<v Speaker 3>groups of people know.</v>

617
00:26:05.661 --> 00:26:07.340
<v Speaker 3>That shit's all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's ridiculous.</v>

618
00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:12.640
<v Speaker 3>It's so fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know this and then it seems like </v>

619
00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:15.440
<v Speaker 3>everybody agrees that that's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they never changes.</v>

620
00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:20.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been hearing for a decade plus </v>

621
00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:22.130
<v Speaker 3>about campaign finance reform stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then it's still,</v>

622
00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:24.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>powerful Super Pacs,</v>

623
00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:26.130
<v Speaker 3>collect them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

624
00:26:26.131 --> 00:26:28.250
<v Speaker 3>we'll just find a loophole and then we </v>
<v Speaker 3>get them money that way.</v>

625
00:26:28.251 --> 00:26:29.270
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing changes.</v>

626
00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:34.660
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the just the amount of money and </v>

627
00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:36.221
<v Speaker 3>influence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all tied in together to try to </v>

628
00:26:36.221 --> 00:26:38.620
<v Speaker 3>completely shake that off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd have to get people to be 100 </v>

629
00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:38.620
<v Speaker 3>percent ethical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would have to say,</v>

630
00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:38.620
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

631
00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:40.490
<v Speaker 3>This is just not the way to run the </v>
<v Speaker 3>government.</v>

632
00:26:40.491 --> 00:26:42.710
<v Speaker 3>It's not right for the people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're not going to do that.</v>

633
00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:44.100
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>too much influence.</v>

634
00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:47.760
<v Speaker 3>It just shows you how sneaky and snaky </v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole thing is,</v>

635
00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:53.030
<v Speaker 3>but it's also really interesting too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we're going to be forced with </v>

636
00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:54.240
<v Speaker 3>this guy because of all this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>chaos.</v>

637
00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:56.670
<v Speaker 3>We're going to be forced to reexamine </v>
<v Speaker 3>how we do things.</v>

638
00:26:57.180 --> 00:27:02.180
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it'll be a little change for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>next president with the.</v>

639
00:27:03.010 --> 00:27:08.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The real worry would be that he would </v>

640
00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:08.010
<v Speaker 3>get through eight years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then one of his sons would take over.</v>

641
00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:10.180
<v Speaker 3>I guess it's not out of the realm of </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibility.</v>

642
00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:15.190
<v Speaker 3>It's not even a little.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have this theory that I think he </v>

643
00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:18.111
<v Speaker 3>actually in a way will really relish and</v>
<v Speaker 3>enjoy the midterms in November going </v>

644
00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:25.350
<v Speaker 3>Democrat because that totally feeds into</v>
<v Speaker 3>his.</v>

645
00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:30.510
<v Speaker 3>They're attacking and like being able to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be like course nothing gets done because</v>

646
00:27:30.511 --> 00:27:35.511
<v Speaker 3>he's fucking concert or an office now </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think that he would really </v>

647
00:27:35.511 --> 00:27:37.140
<v Speaker 3>actually almost enjoy because he loves </v>
<v Speaker 3>combative,</v>

648
00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:41.050
<v Speaker 3>combative relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's actually going to.</v>

649
00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:44.520
<v Speaker 3>If it goes that way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he will like really enjoy it.</v>

650
00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:50.000
<v Speaker 3>I think so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I also think that he likes winning </v>

651
00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:50.000
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He does like winning.</v>

652
00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.070
<v Speaker 3>Of course he likes winning and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>compulsive.</v>

653
00:27:53.071 --> 00:27:55.930
<v Speaker 3>You can tell that when they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know oprah,</v>

654
00:27:55.931 --> 00:27:56.820
<v Speaker 3>you're going to run.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>

655
00:27:56.821 --> 00:27:57.180
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

656
00:27:57.181 --> 00:27:58.820
<v Speaker 3>I hope she runs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kick her fucking ass.</v>

657
00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:00.460
<v Speaker 3>He can't help himself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

658
00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:03.450
<v Speaker 3>He has that kind of competitive side to </v>
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>

659
00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:04.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

660
00:28:04.651 --> 00:28:09.651
<v Speaker 3>he definitely does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well they say they don't want them to </v>

661
00:28:09.651 --> 00:28:09.970
<v Speaker 3>testify because they know they're going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to catch him lying there.</v>

662
00:28:10.010 --> 00:28:11.150
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't do it.</v>

663
00:28:11.850 --> 00:28:13.070
<v Speaker 3>Don't worry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not gonna lie it.</v>

664
00:28:13.170 --> 00:28:15.140
<v Speaker 3>All his lawyers have said like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a hundred percent,</v>

665
00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:16.110
<v Speaker 3>don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>

666
00:28:16.111 --> 00:28:17.070
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll think about it.</v>

667
00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:19.230
<v Speaker 3>Which means that like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

668
00:28:19.231 --> 00:28:20.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he,</v>

669
00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:25.180
<v Speaker 3>he says that a lot with uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can tell them when they have those </v>

670
00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:25.620
<v Speaker 3>off the cuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

671
00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:27.750
<v Speaker 3>press,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he lets the press in,</v>

672
00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:28.920
<v Speaker 3>they'll ask him something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'll be like,</v>

673
00:28:28.921 --> 00:28:30.810
<v Speaker 3>we'll see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is totally like,</v>

674
00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:32.880
<v Speaker 3>I might do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might not,</v>

675
00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:35.600
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that everybody in his size,</v>

676
00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:38.850
<v Speaker 3>like please don't say anything at this </v>
<v Speaker 3>point.</v>

677
00:28:38.851 --> 00:28:41.010
<v Speaker 3>They might not even be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They might be like,</v>

678
00:28:41.011 --> 00:28:42.030
<v Speaker 3>go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

679
00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:43.170
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go ahead.</v>

680
00:28:43.171 --> 00:28:44.630
<v Speaker 3>Tough guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go talk,</v>

681
00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:46.080
<v Speaker 3>go talk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who knows,</v>

682
00:28:46.081 --> 00:28:47.340
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll get another job.</v>

683
00:28:47.341 --> 00:28:50.420
<v Speaker 3>How amazing would it be to watch that </v>
<v Speaker 3>deposition or,</v>

684
00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:51.600
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

685
00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:53.190
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>interview.</v>

686
00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:56.870
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember when Bill Clinton was </v>
<v Speaker 3>grilled about Monica Lewinsky?</v>

687
00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:58.440
<v Speaker 3>The word is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

688
00:28:58.850 --> 00:28:59.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>

689
00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:04.770
<v Speaker 3>And just the term sexual relations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as I understand it,</v>

690
00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:08.590
<v Speaker 3>the way I understand the word,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not it.</v>

691
00:29:08.970 --> 00:29:10.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

692
00:29:10.681 --> 00:29:12.520
<v Speaker 3>I mean that was fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eight.</v>

693
00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:14.850
<v Speaker 3>He's so shameless.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

694
00:29:14.851 --> 00:29:15.870
<v Speaker 3>not just that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

695
00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:19.170
<v Speaker 3>it seems so strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

696
00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:24.230
<v Speaker 3>Back then in the 19 nineties to be able </v>
<v Speaker 3>to watch the president in video get </v>

697
00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:27.450
<v Speaker 3>grilled and clearly they wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 3>release this video to humiliate them.</v>

698
00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:28.590
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

699
00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:30.840
<v Speaker 3>but it was just bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like I've never,</v>

700
00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:35.870
<v Speaker 3>we'd never seen anything like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've never seen a sitting president </v>

701
00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:39.960
<v Speaker 3>like getting grilled by people and </v>
<v Speaker 3>especially about sex and the shift mode.</v>

702
00:29:39.961 --> 00:29:40.890
<v Speaker 3>Like uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

703
00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:45.990
<v Speaker 3>we knew him as this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously you'd see him on the campaign </v>

704
00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:47.170
<v Speaker 3>trail or meeting people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like this super charming,</v>

707
00:29:53.810 --> 00:29:53.810

708
00:29:53.810 --> 00:29:53.990
<v Speaker 3>You don't really good at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>

709

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>knows how to be a politician.</v>

710
00:29:56.740 --> 00:30:01.670
<v Speaker 3>But in that deposition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he switched onto lawyer mode and,</v>

711
00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:04.090
<v Speaker 3>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not here to charm you motherfucker,</v>

712
00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:09.100
<v Speaker 3>because he was spin on is what does is </v>
<v Speaker 3>mean is like,</v>

713
00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:11.020
<v Speaker 3>I remember just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm a kid,</v>

714
00:30:11.021 --> 00:30:12.670
<v Speaker 3>I think I was in high school watching </v>
<v Speaker 3>that and be like,</v>

715
00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:16.050
<v Speaker 3>how does anyone struggle with is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is this.</v>

716
00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:18.910
<v Speaker 3>And I didn't know he was like playing a </v>
<v Speaker 3>game with them too,</v>

717
00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:20.020
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

718
00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:22.500
<v Speaker 3>Well they were playing lawyer games.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

719
00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:25.690
<v Speaker 3>Total war games.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trump can't do that.</v>

720
00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:28.100
<v Speaker 3>He's not smart enough to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

721
00:30:28.390 --> 00:30:30.520
<v Speaker 3>he's not a lawyer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's not.</v>

722
00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:33.820
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't say he's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that trump is not smart.</v>

723
00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:36.070
<v Speaker 3>I think he's smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

724
00:30:36.071 --> 00:30:37.660
<v Speaker 3>I've.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially when you listen to interviews</v>

725
00:30:37.661 --> 00:30:40.750
<v Speaker 3>of him from the past,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he's like,</v>

726
00:30:40.751 --> 00:30:41.910
<v Speaker 3>there's some interviews in the past.</v>

727
00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:43.150
<v Speaker 3>Very articulate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

728
00:30:43.210 --> 00:30:45.010
<v Speaker 3>And obviously been very successful in </v>
<v Speaker 3>business,</v>

729
00:30:45.250 --> 00:30:50.250
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think he's an interested in </v>
<v Speaker 3>expanding his horizons mentally.</v>

730
00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:52.120
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he's interested in </v>
<v Speaker 3>reading.</v>

731
00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:57.150
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he also thinks that he </v>

732
00:30:57.150 --> 00:30:59.101
<v Speaker 3>really 100 percent does the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did run his business off of instinct </v>

733
00:30:59.770 --> 00:31:04.770
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and like gut and relationships and </v>

734
00:31:04.770 --> 00:31:07.270
<v Speaker 3>loyalty and stuff that he's promoting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When they say like,</v>

735
00:31:07.630 --> 00:31:09.310
<v Speaker 3>you can't do that here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like trucking,</v>

736
00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:11.440
<v Speaker 3>mark.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm the president.</v>

737
00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:13.000
<v Speaker 3>Fuck off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People want it.</v>

738
00:31:13.030 --> 00:31:16.090
<v Speaker 3>Do you want to read this briefing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

739
00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:18.070
<v Speaker 3>I don't like to be brief.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like to read.</v>

740
00:31:18.071 --> 00:31:19.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't like to read.</v>

741
00:31:19.450 --> 00:31:22.180
<v Speaker 3>They say they put the word trump in his </v>
<v Speaker 3>briefings a bunch of times,</v>

742
00:31:22.181 --> 00:31:24.460
<v Speaker 3>just so that he reads it screwed ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

743
00:31:24.461 --> 00:31:26.770
<v Speaker 3>This is about me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What else about me?</v>

744
00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:29.820
<v Speaker 3>Amazing French.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

745
00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:34.830
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does feel like it's going to star </v>

746
00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:34.830
<v Speaker 3>report.</v>

747
00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:34.830
<v Speaker 3>This is what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

748
00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:36.590
<v Speaker 3>blood to a star.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

749
00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:42.080
<v Speaker 3>This will be like Miller's report that </v>
<v Speaker 3>would be coming out maybe later this </v>

750
00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:42.080
<v Speaker 3>year or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that the equivalent?</v>

751
00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:43.270
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

752
00:31:43.271 --> 00:31:44.250
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess if they get,</v>

753
00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:46.900
<v Speaker 3>if they get to a real special council </v>
<v Speaker 3>report.</v>

754
00:31:46.901 --> 00:31:47.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

755
00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:52.600
<v Speaker 3>The Mueller thing is so strange because </v>
<v Speaker 3>technically can he fire Mueller?</v>

756
00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:56.080
<v Speaker 3>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a big article about whether or</v>

757
00:31:56.081 --> 00:32:01.081
<v Speaker 3>not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the White House said that they </v>

758
00:32:01.081 --> 00:32:02.350
<v Speaker 3>believe that he does have the power to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do that.</v>

759
00:32:03.210 --> 00:32:04.600
<v Speaker 3>But.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you don't know if that's.</v>

760
00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:09.660
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would think that that means that </v>

761
00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:12.151
<v Speaker 3>they're sent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just wants to put that signal out </v>

762
00:32:12.151 --> 00:32:12.151
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

763
00:32:12.151 --> 00:32:15.600
<v Speaker 3>I can't do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there was other legal minds that </v>

764
00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:19.261
<v Speaker 3>said that he couldn't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he would have to get a bra because </v>

765
00:32:20.231 --> 00:32:22.840
<v Speaker 3>sessions has recused himself from this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

766
00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:26.230
<v Speaker 3>the deputy attorney general Rod </v>
<v Speaker 3>Rosenstein is it,</v>

767
00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:30.790
<v Speaker 3>and that he would have to get him to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>it and then they said that,</v>

768
00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:32.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he would,</v>

769
00:32:32.410 --> 00:32:36.460
<v Speaker 3>would not do that unless,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean Rosenstein said he wouldn't do it</v>

770
00:32:36.461 --> 00:32:40.040
<v Speaker 3>unless a Mueller had done ms.ms</v>
<v Speaker 3>dot</v>

771
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:41.030
<v Speaker 4>conduct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

772
00:32:41.031 --> 00:32:41.470
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

773
00:32:41.471 --> 00:32:43.160
<v Speaker 4>and that if the president tried to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>him do that,</v>

774
00:32:43.161 --> 00:32:48.161
<v Speaker 4>he would resign,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in which case they would have to get </v>

775
00:32:48.161 --> 00:32:48.950
<v Speaker 4>another person either appointed to do it</v>
<v Speaker 4>or whoever's below him to do it.</v>

776
00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:52.610
<v Speaker 4>So it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a really good episode.</v>

777
00:32:56.360 --> 00:33:01.360
<v Speaker 4>I can't remember a time where I felt </v>
<v Speaker 4>like there was nobody at the wheel more </v>

778
00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:02.030
<v Speaker 4>than I do now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

779
00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:05.920
<v Speaker 4>It does feel like chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's,</v>

780
00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:08.960
<v Speaker 4>there's all people that are in </v>
<v Speaker 4>positions,</v>

781
00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:11.150
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's the secretary of state,</v>

782
00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:12.830
<v Speaker 4>there's the chief of staff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's all these,</v>

783
00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:15.620
<v Speaker 4>there's all these different people that </v>
<v Speaker 4>are in positions,</v>

784
00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:17.160
<v Speaker 4>but it feels like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

785
00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:22.500
<v Speaker 4>like make believe and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what happens because this happens </v>

786
00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:25.271
<v Speaker 4>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We get lost in our experience of it </v>

787
00:33:25.271 --> 00:33:28.901
<v Speaker 4>because we live here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm really fascinated by how it looks </v>

788
00:33:28.901 --> 00:33:30.920
<v Speaker 4>outside of have here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

789
00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:33.770

<v Speaker 4>It must really seem like an even crazier</v>

790
00:33:33.771 --> 00:33:34.670
<v Speaker 4>show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>years in the White House lacked.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

00:34:48.010 --> 00:34:52.691
<v Speaker 4>Education Secretary Betsy Devos attended</v>
<v Speaker 4>the weekly sessions in Washington.</v>

818
00:34:53.091 --> 00:34:55.370
<v Speaker 4>While trolling ger claims he doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>tell members,</v>

819
00:34:55.371 --> 00:34:58.550
<v Speaker 4>he's advised in the past how to vote.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He notes that he would,</v>

820
00:34:58.890 --> 00:35:02.270
<v Speaker 4>in quotes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>put the blueprint on the engineer's seat</v>

821
00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:06.410
<v Speaker 4>on the train.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what's going on.</v>

822
00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:12.250
<v Speaker 4>People look to their faith as a source </v>
<v Speaker 4>of guidance and inspiration and Lgbtq </v>

823
00:35:12.250 --> 00:35:13.880
<v Speaker 4>people in our family and friends are no </v>
<v Speaker 4>different.</v>

824
00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:15.890
<v Speaker 4>Drone jurors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>brand of faith,</v>

<v Speaker 4>however,</v>
<v Speaker 4>seeks to drive a wedge between the LG,</v>

826
00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:21.140
<v Speaker 4>that lgbt thing.</v>

827
00:35:21.650 --> 00:35:26.650
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how did trans people get locked in with </v>

828
00:35:26.650 --> 00:35:30.350
<v Speaker 4>queer people or gay people?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Isn't that a different thing?</v>

829
00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:33.170
<v Speaker 4>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they're just all marginalized.</v>

830
00:35:33.171 --> 00:35:34.480
<v Speaker 4>Marginalized groups.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

831
00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:37.710
<v Speaker 4>but they do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know there's a to an a plus.</v>

832
00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:39.240
<v Speaker 4>Do you know that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

833
00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:41.340
<v Speaker 4>Now it's a and a plus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is like a.</v>

834
00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:46.640
<v Speaker 4>This is an abbreviated list,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you really want to be completely </v>

835
00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:49.611
<v Speaker 4>not inclusive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to include asexual people as </v>

836
00:35:49.611 --> 00:35:51.711
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They feel marginalized because they're </v>

837
00:35:51.711 --> 00:35:51.711
<v Speaker 4>not trans than not gay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not straight,</v>

838
00:35:51.711 --> 00:35:52.910
<v Speaker 4>they just not sex weight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why cute?</v>

839
00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:57.920
<v Speaker 4>Q for Queer Queer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but why is that as African Gay and </v>

840
00:35:57.920 --> 00:35:57.920
<v Speaker 4>lesbian?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because it's just Ahmad.</v>

841
00:35:57.920 --> 00:35:59.090
<v Speaker 4>I'm just a weird guy.</v>

842
00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:04.500
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is queer?</v>

843
00:36:04.530 --> 00:36:06.250
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought that men,</v>

844
00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:10.780
<v Speaker 4>people right now are screaming at us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gendered assholes.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

848
00:36:18.130 --> 00:36:18.890
<v Speaker 4>Acu.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

849
00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:20.130
<v Speaker 4>That is different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

850
00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:22.740
<v Speaker 4>What is queer?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is the devastating what?</v>

851
00:36:22.770 --> 00:36:25.620
<v Speaker 4>It's good because we're used to be just </v>
<v Speaker 4>gain gay.</v>

<v Speaker 4>bisexual,</v>
<v Speaker 4>transgender.</v>

866
00:37:03.481 --> 00:37:08.481
<v Speaker 4>To recognize this inclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A popular variant adds the queue for </v>

867
00:37:08.481 --> 00:37:11.220
<v Speaker 4>those who identify as queer or are </v>
<v Speaker 4>questioning their sexual identity.</v>

872
00:37:18.841 --> 00:37:20.550
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or at least that's an answer.</v>

873
00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:22.040
<v Speaker 4>It's fence sitters.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I'm there.</v>

875
00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:28.070
<v Speaker 4>They should have to fence it and my </v>
<v Speaker 4>genders,</v>

876
00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:29.500
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

877
00:37:29.730 --> 00:37:30.930
<v Speaker 4>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Movement.</v>

878
00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:33.420
<v Speaker 4>A fluid gender fluid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's my favorite.</v>

879
00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:35.040
<v Speaker 4>You're a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One day a boy.</v>

880
00:37:35.041 --> 00:37:37.580
<v Speaker 4>The next day I had somebody email me </v>
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>

881
00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:40.470
<v Speaker 4>They said at work they said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

882
00:37:40.530 --> 00:37:44.640
<v Speaker 4>you can pick your gender for emails,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for company emails.</v>

883
00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:49.840
<v Speaker 4>So like this person picked a agenda and </v>
<v Speaker 4>he's like,</v>

884
00:37:50.191 --> 00:37:51.960
<v Speaker 4>I think I'm going to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I said,</v>

885
00:37:51.961 --> 00:37:53.580
<v Speaker 4>well what if your gender is changing?</v>

886
00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:55.260
<v Speaker 4>I think you should send them an email </v>
<v Speaker 4>every day.</v>

887
00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:58.510
<v Speaker 4>So it'd be like today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

888
00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:00.090
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to try it.</v>

889
00:38:00.091 --> 00:38:01.140
<v Speaker 4>See what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do they.</v>

890
00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:02.660
<v Speaker 4>They can't say shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess they can't.</v>

891
00:38:02.690 --> 00:38:03.690
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't say shit all.</v>

892
00:38:03.691 --> 00:38:05.820
<v Speaker 4>You have to just keep a straight face </v>
<v Speaker 4>today.</v>

893
00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:07.580
<v Speaker 4>Identify as a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>

894
00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:10.290
<v Speaker 4>you literally can do whatever you want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Definitely.</v>

895
00:38:10.350 --> 00:38:11.640
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which I mean,</v>

896
00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:14.130
<v Speaker 4>and then people argue that you should </v>
<v Speaker 4>have the right to do that,</v>

897
00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:17.970
<v Speaker 4>to change whenever you want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess.</v>

898
00:38:18.330 --> 00:38:22.710
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's not convenient for everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I guess you can.</v>

899
00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:24.570
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess you can.</v>

900
00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:26.280
<v Speaker 4>It's not the worst thing in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

901
00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:29.520
<v Speaker 4>But when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when do we call it nonsense?</v>

902
00:38:32.130 --> 00:38:37.130
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess there would be a limit because </v>

903
00:38:37.130 --> 00:38:37.130
<v Speaker 4>if you switched it on the hour,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like get the fuck Outta here with that.</v>

904
00:38:37.130 --> 00:38:41.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well what if you decide that you like </v>

905
00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:41.630
<v Speaker 4>identify with things that aren't even </v>
<v Speaker 4>real?</v>

906
00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:46.450
<v Speaker 4>Like elves does Elf kin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a good point.</v>

907
00:38:46.510 --> 00:38:48.940
<v Speaker 4>I think I would have you just decide </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I'm in now.</v>

908
00:38:48.970 --> 00:38:50.530
<v Speaker 4>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if somebody came in your office,</v>

909
00:38:50.531 --> 00:38:53.650
<v Speaker 4>especially if they were a valuable </v>
<v Speaker 4>employee and they were like,</v>

910
00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:57.280
<v Speaker 4>I'm an Elf and they had a straight face </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're like,</v>

911
00:38:57.281 --> 00:38:59.680

<v Speaker 4>company.</v>

912
00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:05.260
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if someone comes into your office </v>

913
00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:05.260
<v Speaker 4>and they're a woman and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>today I'm a man.</v>

914
00:39:05.370 --> 00:39:06.280
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>today.</v>

915
00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:11.520
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I reserved the right to be a woman </v>

916
00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:11.520
<v Speaker 4>back again tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

919
00:39:13.210 --> 00:39:14.380
<v Speaker 4>just to man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

920
00:39:14.381 --> 00:39:14.680
<v Speaker 4>Today.</v>

921
00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:19.240
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There they,</v>

922
00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:23.350
<v Speaker 4>they're letting you decide whether or </v>
<v Speaker 4>not you can accept nonsense.</v>

923
00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:25.150
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

924
00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:26.130
<v Speaker 4>here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

925
00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:32.340
<v Speaker 4>it's spreading though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is growing and it's really a matter </v>

926
00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:35.791
<v Speaker 4>of how many people that don't do that </v>
<v Speaker 4>except that this is a new reality.</v>

927
00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:42.740
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then there's also the thing that we </v>

928
00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:45.271
<v Speaker 4>all know is that some people have an </v>
<v Speaker 4>extreme desire to be special without </v>

929
00:39:45.271 --> 00:39:45.271
<v Speaker 4>doing any work whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

930
00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:47.830
<v Speaker 4>They don't want to have to work to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>special.</v>

931
00:39:48.010 --> 00:39:51.190
<v Speaker 4>They just want to be special.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if they can just say there's a lot of</v>

932
00:39:51.191 --> 00:39:52.200
<v Speaker 4>them on instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

934
00:39:53.570 --> 00:39:56.290
<v Speaker 4>If they could just say they're a part of</v>
<v Speaker 4>some marginalized group,</v>

935
00:39:56.860 --> 00:40:01.860
<v Speaker 4>then instantaneously they get more </v>
<v Speaker 4>respect and this is not taken away from </v>

936
00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:02.380
<v Speaker 4>the people that I think are legitimately</v>
<v Speaker 4>trans.</v>

937
00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:04.830
<v Speaker 4>I think there's definitely people that </v>
<v Speaker 4>are legitimately transfers.</v>

938
00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:06.960
<v Speaker 4>I think those people that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>legitimate,</v>

939
00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:09.910
<v Speaker 4>Lee Trans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she'd be upset at these gender fluid.</v>

940
00:40:09.911 --> 00:40:12.160
<v Speaker 4>Fucking weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was bouncing back and forth all day.</v>

941
00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:17.080
<v Speaker 4>There's a radio lab about that where the</v>
<v Speaker 4>guy decides during the conversation that</v>

942
00:40:17.081 --> 00:40:19.510
<v Speaker 4>he's a man and then he's a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now I switched over.</v>

943
00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:20.920
<v Speaker 4>Now I'm Paul,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now I'm betty.</v>

944
00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:25.450
<v Speaker 4>I just changed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do we address that as 100 percent?</v>

945
00:40:25.451 --> 00:40:27.730
<v Speaker 4>Either you're fucking with me or you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>mentally ill,</v>

946
00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:30.730
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't say mentally ill when it comes</v>

947
00:40:30.731 --> 00:40:34.120
<v Speaker 4>to gender.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the one area where mentally ill,</v>

948
00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:36.020
<v Speaker 4>like if it's violence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

949
00:40:36.310 --> 00:40:39.910
<v Speaker 4>If it's impulsive things like gambling </v>
<v Speaker 4>or something along those lines,</v>

950
00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:42.430
<v Speaker 4>all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could say you're mentally ill.</v>

951
00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:45.760
<v Speaker 4>You cannot say you're mentally ill when </v>
<v Speaker 4>it comes to gender.</v>

952
00:40:45.790 --> 00:40:47.890
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because we're scared.</v>

953
00:40:48.010 --> 00:40:50.950
<v Speaker 4>We're scared of being called out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if somebody is like,</v>

954
00:40:51.010 --> 00:40:53.690
<v Speaker 4>I'm talking right now and they switch </v>
<v Speaker 4>and this switch gender again,</v>

955
00:40:53.710 --> 00:40:57.160
<v Speaker 4>then they switched and they switched the</v>
<v Speaker 4>fourth time in an hour conversation.</v>

956
00:40:57.170 --> 00:41:02.170
<v Speaker 4>We're supposed to just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's exactly that fucking dude that </v>

957
00:41:02.170 --> 00:41:03.100

<v Speaker 4>forth.</v>

1068
00:46:47.230 --> 00:46:47.570
<v Speaker 4>whole life and then all of a sudden you </v>

<v Speaker 4>He asked me to check on the pep story.</v>

1075
00:46:58.261 --> 00:47:00.470
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I swear that's not true and I'm going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>get the FBI on the case on the pis </v>

1078

<v Speaker 4>Do I have your loyalty?</v>

1081
00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:21.980
<v Speaker 4>Checking those pits tapes on real man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Crazy man.</v>

1082
00:47:22.070 --> 00:47:24.260
<v Speaker 4>That'd be another thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Would be fun to watch other pis tapes.</v>

1083
00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:26.990
<v Speaker 4>He's fun for comedy though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tell you what,</v>

1084
00:47:26.991 --> 00:47:27.980
<v Speaker 4>because he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's like,</v>

1085
00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:30.370
<v Speaker 4>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the same time</v>

1086
00:47:31.150 --> 00:47:36.150
<v Speaker 2>you're seeing this massive political </v>
<v Speaker 2>correctness backlash where like people </v>

1087
00:47:36.150 --> 00:47:38.390
<v Speaker 2>are angry at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at him and they,</v>

1088
00:47:38.410 --> 00:47:41.140
<v Speaker 2>they're like pushing really hard and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>other direction.</v>

1089
00:47:41.141 --> 00:47:44.860
<v Speaker 2>So it's created this very volatile </v>
<v Speaker 2>social environment.</v>

1090
00:47:44.890 --> 00:47:48.430
<v Speaker 2>You know the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Zeit geist yeah.</v>

1091
00:47:49.190 --> 00:47:51.430
<v Speaker 2>Verizon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's possible.</v>

1092
00:47:51.431 --> 00:47:54.100
<v Speaker 2>Trump was with hookers peeing on each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>

1093
00:47:56.900 --> 00:47:58.410
<v Speaker 2>It's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1094
00:47:58.650 --> 00:48:00.760
<v Speaker 2>how did he say that in an interview?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1095
00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:05.020
<v Speaker 2>How did he say it though?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to hear it like his actual words.</v>

1096
00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:08.230
<v Speaker 2>If it's on here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is to.</v>

1097
00:48:08.250 --> 00:48:11.050
<v Speaker 2>He says it's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could it be like,</v>

1098
00:48:11.051 --> 00:48:11.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1099
00:48:12.730 --> 00:48:17.730
<v Speaker 8>per conversation about how the trump </v>
<v Speaker 8>team would position this and what they </v>

1100
00:48:17.730 --> 00:48:22.711
<v Speaker 8>could say about this.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They actually started talking about </v>

1101
00:48:22.711 --> 00:48:24.880
<v Speaker 8>drafting a press release with us still </v>
<v Speaker 8>sitting there and the reason that was so</v>

1102
00:48:24.881 --> 00:48:27.730
<v Speaker 8>striking to me is that that's just not </v>
<v Speaker 8>done.</v>

1103
00:48:28.270 --> 00:48:30.880
<v Speaker 8>That the intelligence community does </v>
<v Speaker 8>intelligence.</v>

1104
00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:36.250
<v Speaker 8>The White House does pr and spin.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You also said you were struck by what?</v>

1105
00:48:36.251 --> 00:48:40.720
<v Speaker 8>They didn't ask very much.</v>
<v Speaker 8>No one to my recollection asked,</v>

1106
00:48:40.990 --> 00:48:44.230
<v Speaker 8>so what?</v>
<v Speaker 8>What's coming next from the Russians?</v>

1107
00:48:44.260 --> 00:48:47.620
<v Speaker 8>How might we stop it?</v>
<v Speaker 8>What's the future look like?</v>

1108
00:48:47.830 --> 00:48:52.830
<v Speaker 8>It was all might not come up.</v>
<v Speaker 8>What can we say about what they did and </v>

1109
00:48:52.830 --> 00:48:56.461
<v Speaker 8>how it affects the election that we just</v>
<v Speaker 8>had call me then asked to meet alone </v>

1110
00:48:56.461 --> 00:49:00.751
<v Speaker 8>with trump,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but was it a longer than trump's ties to</v>

1111
00:49:02.111 --> 00:49:07.111
<v Speaker 8>Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 8>including allegations of trump's </v>

1112
00:49:07.111 --> 00:49:07.111
<v Speaker 8>encounters with prostitutes,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Moscow.</v>

1113
00:49:07.111 --> 00:49:09.730
<v Speaker 8>I'm about to meet with a person who </v>
<v Speaker 8>doesn't know me.</v>

1114
00:49:10.090 --> 00:49:15.090
<v Speaker 8>It's just been elected president of the </v>
<v Speaker 8>United States by all accounts and from </v>

1115
00:49:15.641 --> 00:49:20.641
<v Speaker 8>my watching him during the campaign </v>
<v Speaker 8>could be volatile and I'm about to talk </v>

1116
00:49:20.711 --> 00:49:25.711
<v Speaker 8>to him about allegations that he was </v>
<v Speaker 8>involved with prostitutes in Moscow and </v>

1117
00:49:26.171 --> 00:49:29.230
<v Speaker 8>that the Russians taped it and have </v>
<v Speaker 8>leverage over him.</v>

1118
00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:34.320
<v Speaker 8>Was there any choice there a why?</v>
<v Speaker 8>If this was salacious and this </v>

1119
00:49:35.261 --> 00:49:38.110
<v Speaker 8>particular part of the dossier?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Unverified.</v>

1120
00:49:38.111 --> 00:49:40.000
<v Speaker 8>Still unverified by the way?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yes.</v>

1121
00:49:40.690 --> 00:49:42.730
<v Speaker 8>So far as when I got fired,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it was unverified.</v>

1122
00:49:42.820 --> 00:49:47.820
<v Speaker 8>Did you tell him that the steele dossier</v>
<v Speaker 8>had been financed by his political </v>

1123
00:49:47.820 --> 00:49:47.820
<v Speaker 8>opponents?</v>
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

1124
00:49:47.820 --> 00:49:52.020
<v Speaker 8>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't even think I used the term </v>

1125
00:49:52.020 --> 00:49:52.020
<v Speaker 8>steele dossier.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I just talked about additional material,</v>

1126
00:49:52.020 --> 00:49:56.760
<v Speaker 8>but did he have a right to know that </v>
<v Speaker 8>that had been financed by his political </v>

1127
00:49:56.760 --> 00:49:57.400
<v Speaker 8>opponents?</v>
<v Speaker 8>That I don't know the answer to,</v>

1128
00:49:57.430 --> 00:50:01.390
<v Speaker 8>that it wasn't necessary for.</v>

<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Why doesn't he have to take a pee test?</v>

1154

<v Speaker 2>You have to take a peek.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trump,</v>

<v Speaker 2>He doesn't sleep a lot.</v>

1160
00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:19.700
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of energy and there's some</v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence from many different reporters </v>

1161
00:51:19.700 --> 00:51:22.670
<v Speaker 2>that one reporter even named the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pharmacy where he used to get a speed.</v>

1162
00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:25.730
<v Speaker 2>He was on diet pills that you're only </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to take for a little while.</v>

1163
00:51:25.731 --> 00:51:30.731
<v Speaker 2>He took him for like six years and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>there was another reporter we talked </v>

1164
00:51:30.731 --> 00:51:34.790
<v Speaker 2>about recently that was saying that he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>on one of the fence.</v>

1165
00:51:35.570 --> 00:51:38.150
<v Speaker 2>He's won one of those now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which totally makes sense.</v>

1166
00:51:38.151 --> 00:51:40.490
<v Speaker 2>He is 70 what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seventy one?</v>

1167
00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:42.810
<v Speaker 2>Seventy one?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1168
00:51:43.190 --> 00:51:44.870
<v Speaker 2>How does he have so much fucking energy?</v>

1169
00:51:45.030 --> 00:51:47.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy has a shit ton of energy.</v>

1170
00:51:47.211 --> 00:51:48.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he was on the campaign trail,</v>

1171
00:51:48.831 --> 00:51:49.670
<v Speaker 2>he just would go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

1172
00:51:49.671 --> 00:51:53.150
<v Speaker 2>go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like three stops of fucking day,</v>

1173
00:51:53.410 --> 00:51:54.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting on plane land somewhere.</v>

1174
00:51:54.990 --> 00:51:58.490
<v Speaker 2>I do a rally good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No Problem Eating Kentucky Fried Chicken</v>

1175
00:51:58.860 --> 00:52:02.330
<v Speaker 2>wasn't eating healthy fried chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

1176
00:52:02.540 --> 00:52:04.160
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah man,</v>

1177
00:52:04.161 --> 00:52:09.161
<v Speaker 2>I think he's on speed and it makes me </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to get on speed pace.</v>

1178
00:52:10.170 --> 00:52:12.260
<v Speaker 2>We want to be more productive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's,</v>

1179
00:52:12.290 --> 00:52:14.630
<v Speaker 2>there's so many people I know that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>on adderall.</v>

1180
00:52:14.660 --> 00:52:15.980
<v Speaker 2>So many.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never tried it.</v>

1181
00:52:16.100 --> 00:52:18.170
<v Speaker 2>I never have either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie gave me some of them scared,</v>

1182
00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:20.000
<v Speaker 2>just sitting around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you watch that documentary yet?</v>

1183
00:52:20.030 --> 00:52:25.030
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just talks about how many people are </v>

1184
00:52:25.030 --> 00:52:25.030
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just is crazy.</v>

1185
00:52:25.030 --> 00:52:26.040
<v Speaker 2>So many all day everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1186
00:52:26.170 --> 00:52:31.170
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my stem cell doctor was telling me that </v>

1187
00:52:31.170 --> 00:52:33.020
<v Speaker 2>when he was in medical school that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that it was with,</v>

1188
00:52:33.170 --> 00:52:34.080
<v Speaker 2>like all the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1189
00:52:34.081 --> 00:52:39.081
<v Speaker 2>the people who's going to school with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were all taken adderall and he was </v>

1190
00:52:39.081 --> 00:52:41.681
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would watch them finish papers and I </v>

1191
00:52:41.681 --> 00:52:41.681
<v Speaker 2>just couldn't understand where they had </v>
<v Speaker 2>the energy from.</v>

1192
00:52:41.681 --> 00:52:41.681
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

1193
00:52:41.681 --> 00:52:46.451
<v Speaker 2>we're on adderall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this is the way to go and just </v>

1194
00:52:46.451 --> 00:52:46.451
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

1195
00:52:46.451 --> 00:52:50.740
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes you feel like you have to get </v>

1196
00:52:50.740 --> 00:52:51.830
<v Speaker 2>on it because all these people are so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so productive when they're on it.</v>

1197
00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:56.920
<v Speaker 2>I've heard comics talk about it to </v>
<v Speaker 2>comics really don't think I would think </v>

1198
00:52:56.920 --> 00:53:01.841
<v Speaker 2>you'd be to ramped up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think when they said they had like a </v>

1199
00:53:01.841 --> 00:53:02.690
<v Speaker 2>lot of work to do those jobs and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1200
00:53:02.691 --> 00:53:04.640
<v Speaker 2>I gotta get this done and get that done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1201
00:53:04.910 --> 00:53:08.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The downsides got to be rough though.</v>

1202
00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:10.240
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

1203
00:53:10.241 --> 00:53:11.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know anything about it really.</v>

1204
00:53:11.631 --> 00:53:13.910
<v Speaker 2>I mean I know that it's popular and </v>
<v Speaker 2>people have been taking it for,</v>

1205
00:53:14.150 --> 00:53:17.750
<v Speaker 2>but I mean like when you come off it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure Jamie did you ever.</v>

1206
00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:20.870
<v Speaker 2>You did it right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did it twice I think,</v>

1207
00:53:20.871 --> 00:53:23.600
<v Speaker 2>but I think I also took two different </v>
<v Speaker 2>versions of it because there's different</v>

1208
00:53:23.601 --> 00:53:24.680
<v Speaker 2>kinds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not just like,</v>

1209
00:53:24.710 --> 00:53:26.040
<v Speaker 2>was it in a row and now you're taking</v>

1210
00:53:26.060 --> 00:53:27.300
<v Speaker 3>adderall?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was it to work?</v>

1211
00:53:27.301 --> 00:53:29.580
<v Speaker 3>Or like just recreation had like art </v>
<v Speaker 3>projects or something.</v>

1212
00:53:29.581 --> 00:53:31.820
<v Speaker 3>I was trying to get done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I really wanted to get it done.</v>

1213
00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:36.920
<v Speaker 3>I was also interested to see what it </v>
<v Speaker 3>would be like because I've never taken </v>

1214
00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:36.920
<v Speaker 3>it and I've heard friends take it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some,</v>

1215
00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:37.310
<v Speaker 3>some of my friends really just take it </v>
<v Speaker 3>to drink more,</v>

1216
00:53:37.890 --> 00:53:39.570
<v Speaker 3>most of it because we're not in college </v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore,</v>

1217
00:53:39.571 --> 00:53:41.130
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

1218
00:53:41.340 --> 00:53:46.340
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the one time I took it I had a day </v>

1219
00:53:46.340 --> 00:53:46.650
<v Speaker 3>off and it kept me up the whole time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what I thought would happen.</v>

1220
00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:49.410
<v Speaker 3>But then the next day I was also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just still up.</v>

1221
00:53:49.411 --> 00:53:51.150
<v Speaker 3>I tried to go to bed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't go to,</v>

1222
00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:53.710
<v Speaker 3>couldn't fall asleep with a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's out of your system.</v>

1223
00:53:53.711 --> 00:53:55.440
<v Speaker 3>It's just a little bit to like five </v>
<v Speaker 3>milligrams,</v>

1224
00:53:55.441 --> 00:53:58.500
<v Speaker 3>maybe 10 of the slow release because </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's also fast release.</v>

1225
00:53:58.530 --> 00:54:03.530
<v Speaker 3>You can pop the pill and take the salts </v>
<v Speaker 3>directly in without having a time </v>

1226
00:54:03.530 --> 00:54:04.410
<v Speaker 3>release.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's different variations.</v>

1227
00:54:04.411 --> 00:54:06.240
<v Speaker 3>What about the day after that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you just crash?</v>

1228
00:54:06.241 --> 00:54:07.340
<v Speaker 3>Super.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was fine.</v>

1229
00:54:07.350 --> 00:54:08.730
<v Speaker 3>I was normal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just thought I was.</v>

1230
00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:10.230
<v Speaker 3>I was afraid to go to work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was serving.</v>

1231
00:54:10.231 --> 00:54:15.231
<v Speaker 3>I thought I was going to crash while I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was serving people's tables and drop </v>

1232
00:54:15.231 --> 00:54:15.231
<v Speaker 3>food everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have the day off,</v>

1233
00:54:15.231 --> 00:54:15.231
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1234
00:54:15.231 --> 00:54:15.450
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1235
00:54:16.090 --> 00:54:17.460
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1236
00:54:17.490 --> 00:54:19.410
<v Speaker 3>you remember Robert Schimmel?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1237
00:54:19.470 --> 00:54:21.660
<v Speaker 3>He accidentally took it once.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Accidentally.</v>

1238
00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:25.470
<v Speaker 3>He got the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So not bob shoveled personality.</v>

1239
00:54:25.470 --> 00:54:25.470
<v Speaker 3>They.</v>

1240
00:54:25.570 --> 00:54:26.410
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>

1241
00:54:27.310 --> 00:54:28.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was like super mellow.</v>

1242
00:54:28.810 --> 00:54:29.950
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he told me,</v>

1243
00:54:29.951 --> 00:54:34.951
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he accidentally took it and he called </v>

1244
00:54:34.951 --> 00:54:35.090
<v Speaker 2>his doctor panicking because he had </v>
<v Speaker 2>serious heart condition.</v>

1245
00:54:35.091 --> 00:54:36.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the doctor said,</v>

1246
00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:38.320
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just,</v>

1247
00:54:38.321 --> 00:54:40.540
<v Speaker 2>it's just gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's gonna last for about 12 hours.</v>

1248
00:54:41.260 --> 00:54:41.890
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1249
00:54:41.891 --> 00:54:43.540
<v Speaker 2>I got so much shit done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

1250
00:54:43.541 --> 00:54:45.940
<v Speaker 2>I just sat in front of my computer and </v>
<v Speaker 2>organize my notes.</v>

1251
00:54:45.941 --> 00:54:49.540
<v Speaker 2>I got all my act together just makes you</v>
<v Speaker 2>really productive apparently,</v>

1252
00:54:50.350 --> 00:54:55.350
<v Speaker 2>but we're gonna you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to change the way people </v>

1253
00:54:55.420 --> 00:54:58.030
<v Speaker 2>interact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to change the way he made.</v>

1254
00:54:58.050 --> 00:55:00.000
<v Speaker 2>If more and more people continue to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1255
00:55:00.010 --> 00:55:02.870
<v Speaker 2>going to change the way people feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>about other people,</v>

1256
00:55:02.871 --> 00:55:07.871
<v Speaker 2>they're going to be all jazzed up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think he's on some version of that </v>

1257
00:55:07.871 --> 00:55:07.990
<v Speaker 2>president?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1258
00:55:08.260 --> 00:55:10.850
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to try it.</v>

1259
00:55:10.850 --> 00:55:13.210
<v Speaker 2>And I think if these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if these reporters are correct,</v>

1260
00:55:13.300 --> 00:55:18.190
<v Speaker 2>pull up that story about the reporter </v>
<v Speaker 2>that even listed the Duane Reed pharmacy</v>

1261
00:55:18.191 --> 00:55:23.191
<v Speaker 2>in New York where trump was on the shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>for six years and then they think that </v>

1262
00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:28.440
<v Speaker 2>trump is on something now and they even </v>
<v Speaker 2>specified the stuff that he's on.</v>

1263
00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:34.600
<v Speaker 2>Hillary was on some shit too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's on either in new vigil or pro </v>

1264
00:55:34.811 --> 00:55:37.210
<v Speaker 2>vigil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're both very similar.</v>

1265
00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:42.600
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's the stuff that they give to </v>

1266
00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:42.600
<v Speaker 2>narcolepsy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People with narcolepsy.</v>

1267
00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:43.510
<v Speaker 2>Really awake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1268
00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:44.830
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It keeps you awake,</v>

1269
00:55:44.831 --> 00:55:46.030
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have to drive,</v>

1270
00:55:46.060 --> 00:55:47.380
<v Speaker 2>he'd pop on them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>New vigils.</v>

1271
00:55:47.740 --> 00:55:52.740
<v Speaker 2>That's an interesting one because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't give you the same sort of </v>

1272
00:55:52.740 --> 00:55:52.740
<v Speaker 2>speediness I'm really bad at night </v>
<v Speaker 2>driving.</v>

1273
00:55:52.740 --> 00:55:57.511
<v Speaker 2>I feel tired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those lines they started hitting into </v>

1274
00:55:57.511 --> 00:56:00.720
<v Speaker 2>just to embrace you will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll keep you calm.</v>

1275
00:56:01.070 --> 00:56:02.140
<v Speaker 2>And if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's warm,</v>

1276
00:56:02.200 --> 00:56:04.390
<v Speaker 2>if you're in a cold place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the heat on in the car,</v>

1277
00:56:05.290 --> 00:56:10.290
<v Speaker 2>that's rough.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

1296
00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:51.850
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fun Fact.</v>

1297
00:56:52.180 --> 00:56:57.180
<v Speaker 2>Nineteen 82.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trump started taking amphetamine </v>

1298
00:56:57.180 --> 00:56:57.180
<v Speaker 2>derivatives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Abused them.</v>

1299
00:56:57.180 --> 00:56:59.800
<v Speaker 2>Only supposed to take two for 25 days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stayed on him for eight years.</v>

1300
00:57:00.490 --> 00:57:01.480
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1301
00:57:01.780 --> 00:57:03.520
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the White House.</v>

1302
00:57:03.521 --> 00:57:08.521
<v Speaker 2>Admitted it to me saying only for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>short time for diet when he was not </v>

1303
00:57:08.521 --> 00:57:08.521
<v Speaker 2>overweight.</v>

1304
00:57:08.530 --> 00:57:10.990
<v Speaker 2>I countered with medical records.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They cut me off.</v>

1305
00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:15.910
<v Speaker 2>People misreading drug was die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ethel probe,</v>

1306
00:57:16.490 --> 00:57:21.490
<v Speaker 2>p n d I e t h y l p r o p t I o n 75 </v>
<v Speaker 2>milligrams a day prescription filled at </v>

1307
00:57:26.411 --> 00:57:31.411
<v Speaker 2>Duane reed on 57th street in Manhattan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not that I know things get crazy.</v>

1308
00:57:32.590 --> 00:57:37.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm the doctor wrote the prescription Dr</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joseph Greenberg diagnosed him with </v>

1309
00:57:37.751 --> 00:57:41.080
<v Speaker 2>metabolic imbalance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we have never heard about.</v>

1310
00:57:41.081 --> 00:57:46.081
<v Speaker 2>Again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Greenberg was later publicly slammed as </v>

1311
00:57:46.081 --> 00:57:47.560
<v Speaker 2>someone who would provide uppers to rich</v>
<v Speaker 2>people in Manhattan,</v>

1312
00:57:47.830 --> 00:57:52.830
<v Speaker 2>metabolic imbalance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if true could be an electrolyte </v>

1313
00:57:52.830 --> 00:57:55.180
<v Speaker 2>insufficiencies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anaerobic imbalances,</v>

1314
00:57:55.510 --> 00:58:00.510
<v Speaker 2>acid imbalances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and as sort of an assortment of related </v>

1315
00:58:00.510 --> 00:58:02.680
<v Speaker 2>disorders that can have serious health </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequences.</v>

1316
00:58:02.681 --> 00:58:07.200
<v Speaker 2>Yet his other doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dr Harold Bornstein said,</v>

1317
00:58:07.210 --> 00:58:12.210
<v Speaker 2>been trump's dr since 1988.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never mentioned the metal bulk and </v>

1318
00:58:12.210 --> 00:58:14.020
<v Speaker 2>balance found by Greenberg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this guy would just like Tommy,</v>

00:58:14.140 --> 00:58:17.490
<v Speaker 2>you've got a medical imbalance or </v>
<v Speaker 2>metabolic metabolic imbalance.</v>

<v Speaker 2>those pills.</v>

1355
00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:38.930
<v Speaker 2>The thing about when you think about </v>
<v Speaker 2>amphetamines,</v>

1356
00:59:39.020 --> 00:59:44.020
<v Speaker 2>when you think about brash decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about people that are overly,</v>

<v Speaker 2>overly confident,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>conspiracy.</v>

1363
00:59:55.370 --> 00:59:56.690
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To say that that's happening.</v>

1364
00:59:56.780 --> 00:59:58.310
<v Speaker 2>It's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But now that's my question,</v>

1365
00:59:58.311 --> 01:00:00.600
<v Speaker 2>like why don't they test them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>coop.</v>

1394
01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:03.680
<v Speaker 2>Just kill them all and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll just kill them all and then I'll</v>

1395
01:01:03.681 --> 01:01:04.630
<v Speaker 2>kill them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1396
01:01:05.210 --> 01:01:07.220
<v Speaker 2>But that's just fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would you do?</v>

1397
01:01:07.290 --> 01:01:08.780
<v Speaker 2>Shoot him?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

1398
01:01:08.930 --> 01:01:10.350
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1399
01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:14.130
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if my neighbors would tell the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cops if they're heard pop,</v>

1400
01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:14.870
<v Speaker 2>pop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pop.</v>

1401
01:01:15.030 --> 01:01:19.010
<v Speaker 2>We just hit him with a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That shotgun fucking head checking.</v>

1402
01:01:19.220 --> 01:01:22.190
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what I would use.</v>

1403
01:01:22.310 --> 01:01:27.310
<v Speaker 2>It'd be hard to shoot him with a bow </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'd have to get them to sit </v>

1404
01:01:27.310 --> 01:01:27.740
<v Speaker 2>still.</v>

1405
01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:32.800
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I drew back and then they'd be </v>

1406
01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:34.901
<v Speaker 2>running around the chicken coop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'd be in there with them in the </v>

1407
01:01:34.901 --> 01:01:34.901
<v Speaker 2>chicken coop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1408
01:01:34.901 --> 01:01:35.340
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what would they do?</v>

1409
01:01:35.341 --> 01:01:36.740
<v Speaker 2>Would they attack me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>

1410
01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:38.840
<v Speaker 2>Maybe if they're feeling panicked to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that panic,</v>

1411
01:01:38.940 --> 01:01:43.940
<v Speaker 2>they felt trapped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It certainly will be running around in </v>

1412
01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:43.940
<v Speaker 2>circles with whether or not they decide </v>
<v Speaker 2>to just leap at me,</v>

1413
01:01:43.970 --> 01:01:45.890
<v Speaker 2>bite my face off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe a rifle.</v>

1414
01:01:46.010 --> 01:01:48.680
<v Speaker 2>That'd be the easiest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably loud as fuck.</v>

1415
01:01:48.681 --> 01:01:49.730
<v Speaker 2>Super loud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1416
01:01:49.731 --> 01:01:54.731
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a couple of those going off in </v>

1417
01:01:54.731 --> 01:01:54.731
<v Speaker 2>the backyard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People gonna call the cops.</v>

1418
01:01:54.731 --> 01:01:57.880
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then would you get in trouble for </v>

1419
01:01:57.880 --> 01:01:58.430
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you're supposed to shoot a</v>

1420
01:01:58.431 --> 01:01:59.810
<v Speaker 2>gun in your yard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tom.</v>

1421
01:01:59.930 --> 01:02:02.840
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what if you feel threatened?</v>

1422
01:02:03.050 --> 01:02:04.520
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you were,</v>

1423
01:02:04.580 --> 01:02:09.580
<v Speaker 2>if someone was breaking into your home </v>
<v Speaker 2>and threatening your life and you shot </v>

1424
01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:09.680
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be one thing.</v>

1425
01:02:09.770 --> 01:02:12.620
<v Speaker 2>Defensive Life and property.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not this.</v>

1426
01:02:13.790 --> 01:02:15.830
<v Speaker 2>This is like you have a varmint in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>backyard.</v>

1427
01:02:16.220 --> 01:02:18.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you'd get in trouble for </v>
<v Speaker 2>killing coyotes.</v>

1428
01:02:19.830 --> 01:02:20.430
<v Speaker 2>Coyotes</v>

1429
01:02:20.490 --> 01:02:25.490
<v Speaker 4>are thought of as like rats as crazy as </v>
<v Speaker 4>that because we have a hierarchy when it</v>

1430
01:02:25.561 --> 01:02:26.430
<v Speaker 4>comes to animals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1431
01:02:26.490 --> 01:02:28.020
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean we love,</v>

1432
01:02:29.010 --> 01:02:34.010
<v Speaker 4>we love dogs and cats,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we don't really give a shit about </v>

1433
01:02:34.010 --> 01:02:34.010
<v Speaker 4>mice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1434
01:02:34.010 --> 01:02:34.740
<v Speaker 4>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everywhere you go.</v>

1435
01:02:34.741 --> 01:02:36.780
<v Speaker 4>You buy mice traps.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Snap their necks.</v>

1436
01:02:36.781 --> 01:02:38.190
<v Speaker 4>Electrocute them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1437
01:02:38.790 --> 01:02:39.930
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even glue traps.</v>

1438
01:02:39.931 --> 01:02:42.270
<v Speaker 4>Those are the worst mice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Get stuck on the glue.</v>

1439
01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:47.360
<v Speaker 4>Put One of those.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I tell you that like 10 years ago I </v>

1440
01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:48.030
<v Speaker 4>lived in silver lake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see rats crawling over here.</v>

1441
01:02:48.031 --> 01:02:49.710
<v Speaker 4>Rats.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see rats all the time.</v>

1442
01:02:50.010 --> 01:02:54.000
<v Speaker 4>I went to this at this office.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was working part time and they go,</v>

1443
01:02:54.001 --> 01:02:54.780
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the guy was like,</v>

1445
01:02:55.951 --> 01:02:58.470

<v Speaker 4>take these rat traps with you,</v>

1446
01:02:58.620 --> 01:03:01.030
<v Speaker 4>like glue traps and they'll get stuck in</v>
<v Speaker 4>it and uh,</v>

1447
01:03:01.420 --> 01:03:02.340
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's perfect.</v>

1448
01:03:02.341 --> 01:03:03.060
<v Speaker 4>That's what you should do.</v>

1449
01:03:03.630 --> 01:03:05.790
<v Speaker 4>So I took it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>put some peanut butter on it,</v>

1450
01:03:05.791 --> 01:03:10.791
<v Speaker 4>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>put it in the backyard and the next day </v>

1451
01:03:10.791 --> 01:03:13.300
<v Speaker 4>they were flipped over and shit on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like the rat step.</v>

1452
01:03:13.301 --> 01:03:14.640
<v Speaker 4>Then it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck this,</v>

1453
01:03:15.030 --> 01:03:17.190
<v Speaker 4>flipped it over and took a shit on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1454
01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:17.970
<v Speaker 4>fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1455
01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:19.590

<v Speaker 4>I told him.</v>

1456
01:03:19.591 --> 01:03:20.010
<v Speaker 4>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1457
01:03:20.020 --> 01:03:22.410
<v Speaker 4>that's pretty big rat then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1458
01:03:22.830 --> 01:03:27.450
<v Speaker 4>I caught a big one in my backyard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my garage rather when I lived in Encino,</v>

1459
01:03:28.050 --> 01:03:28.590
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1460
01:03:28.670 --> 01:03:30.330
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the trap came down,</v>

1461
01:03:30.331 --> 01:03:31.770
<v Speaker 4>snapped his neck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>killed him.</v>

1462
01:03:31.830 --> 01:03:33.240
<v Speaker 4>I went out there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's up fat boy.</v>

1463
01:03:33.241 --> 01:03:34.260

01:03:36.781 --> 01:03:39.180
<v Speaker 4>I'll get that in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just left it out there.</v>

1466
01:03:39.181 --> 01:03:44.181
<v Speaker 4>I went back in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was eating everything except the </v>

1467
01:03:44.181 --> 01:03:44.181
<v Speaker 4>tail.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They ate him though.</v>

1468
01:03:44.181 --> 01:03:44.400
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that makes sense.</v>

1469
01:03:44.970 --> 01:03:45.990
<v Speaker 4>On each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Netflix?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1473
01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:54.480
<v Speaker 4>Woo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Say it should.</v>

1474

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1475
01:03:57.050 --> 01:03:58.470
<v Speaker 4>I don't need it in my head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't need it.</v>

1476
01:03:58.770 --> 01:04:00.070
<v Speaker 4>Need it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jeremy saw it.</v>

1477
01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:01.920
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking great.</v>

1478
01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:07.600
<v Speaker 4>Let me just makes you realize the sheer </v>
<v Speaker 4>volume of them in American cities </v>

1479
01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:07.600
<v Speaker 4>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

1480
01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:08.820
<v Speaker 4>It's more rats in New York City than </v>
<v Speaker 4>there are people.</v>

1481
01:04:08.850 --> 01:04:10.810
<v Speaker 4>They said that they'll get through the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1482
01:04:10.890 --> 01:04:15.890
<v Speaker 4>or mice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At least we'll get through a hole the </v>

1483
01:04:15.890 --> 01:04:18.250
<v Speaker 4>size of a dime or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're flexible and they're.</v>

1484
01:04:18.251 --> 01:04:21.420
<v Speaker 4>They just shove their way in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not like us.</v>

1485
01:04:21.750 --> 01:04:23.220
<v Speaker 4>They're crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're crazy smart.</v>

1486
01:04:23.221 --> 01:04:27.000
<v Speaker 4>To the older rats,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll send younger rats to go check on</v>

1487
01:04:27.001 --> 01:04:32.001
<v Speaker 4>bates and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or someone leaves behind rat bait that </v>

1488
01:04:32.001 --> 01:04:32.100
<v Speaker 4>is poisoning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The old rats will sit back like,</v>

1489
01:04:32.101 --> 01:04:34.200
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so on the young rats,</v>

1490
01:04:34.210 --> 01:04:35.360
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>move over here.</v>

1491
01:04:35.370 --> 01:04:36.450
<v Speaker 4>Was that food?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your car,</v>

1492
01:04:36.470 --> 01:04:38.100
<v Speaker 4>your car is not going to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not going to eat.</v>

1493
01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:39.070
<v Speaker 4>Good man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good.</v>

1494
01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:41.910
<v Speaker 4>I eat and then he'll eat and die and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll go,</v>

1495
01:04:41.911 --> 01:04:43.470
<v Speaker 4>yep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought so.</v>

1496
01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:47.080
<v Speaker 4>So because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've developed poisoned.</v>

1497
01:04:47.100 --> 01:04:49.620
<v Speaker 4>That takes like 10,</v>
<v Speaker 4>11 hours to kick in.</v>

1498
01:04:50.070 --> 01:04:51.640
<v Speaker 4>So one rattle eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

1499
01:04:51.641 --> 01:04:52.740
<v Speaker 4>how are you feeling?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm feeling great,</v>

1500
01:04:53.010 --> 01:04:54.270
<v Speaker 4>I'm fine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm fine.</v>

1501
01:04:54.540 --> 01:04:56.400
<v Speaker 4>And then the other rats will eat it too </v>
<v Speaker 4>because they're like,</v>

1502
01:04:56.430 --> 01:04:57.180
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's okay.</v>

1503
01:04:57.780 --> 01:04:59.120
<v Speaker 4>And then yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they're,</v>

1504
01:04:59.121 --> 01:05:04.121
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're developing these slow release </v>

1505
01:05:04.121 --> 01:05:06.261
<v Speaker 4>poisons,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then you just have this rotting rat </v>

1506
01:05:06.261 --> 01:05:07.320
<v Speaker 4>like you're not stop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no way you're going to eradicate</v>

1507
01:05:07.321 --> 01:05:08.580
<v Speaker 4>the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if someone said,</v>

1508
01:05:08.581 --> 01:05:13.581
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've got a solution to completely </v>

1509
01:05:13.581 --> 01:05:13.581
<v Speaker 4>eliminate all the rats were New York </v>
<v Speaker 4>City,</v>

1510
01:05:13.581 --> 01:05:14.130
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no you don't.</v>

1511
01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:15.970
<v Speaker 4>Is there no solution?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no solution isn't.</v>

1512
01:05:16.100 --> 01:05:21.100
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Unless you little robot rats that eat </v>

1513
01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:21.100
<v Speaker 4>rats.</v>

1514
01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:23.050
<v Speaker 4>Oh right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All they do is eat rats.</v>

1515
01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:26.950
<v Speaker 4>That's what you'd have to let loose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He'd have to let loose a scourge.</v>

1516
01:05:27.430 --> 01:05:32.430
<v Speaker 4>Just a pack of robot rat eating rats </v>
<v Speaker 4>that only eat rats and they can do what </v>

1517
01:05:33.491 --> 01:05:35.770
<v Speaker 4>rats do there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the one that had a bought flying.</v>

1518
01:05:35.780 --> 01:05:37.840
<v Speaker 4>It's body that was like the size of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>football.</v>

1519
01:05:38.110 --> 01:05:40.660
<v Speaker 4>What was in his body?</v>
<v Speaker 4>A Bot fly that lava.</v>

1520
01:05:41.290 --> 01:05:43.750
<v Speaker 4>See that whole next to his neck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was a.</v>

1521
01:05:43.751 --> 01:05:45.640
<v Speaker 4>There was a parasite in there that was </v>
<v Speaker 4>that big.</v>

1522
01:05:45.820 --> 01:05:49.030
<v Speaker 4>That's like if you had a soccer ball </v>
<v Speaker 4>growing out of your chest.</v>

1523
01:05:49.900 --> 01:05:54.900
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the rats dead and that thing is </v>

1524
01:05:54.900 --> 01:05:54.900
<v Speaker 4>alive still.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

1525
01:05:54.900 --> 01:05:55.120
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's in the dock.</v>

1526
01:05:55.210 --> 01:05:56.960
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the.</v>

1527
01:05:56.961 --> 01:06:01.090
<v Speaker 4>And they were finding all these crazy </v>
<v Speaker 4>diseases that are just totally fatal,</v>

1528
01:06:01.390 --> 01:06:04.600
<v Speaker 4>just floating around inside the rat's </v>
<v Speaker 4>body and rats,</v>

1529
01:06:04.780 --> 01:06:07.960
<v Speaker 4>like they're fine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it would kill us.</v>

1530
01:06:08.050 --> 01:06:09.280
<v Speaker 4>How's that happened?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1531
01:06:09.281 --> 01:06:11.270
<v Speaker 4>there's a foul,</v>
<v Speaker 4>foul little creature.</v>

1532
01:06:11.310 --> 01:06:16.310
<v Speaker 4>So fat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why don't we just set like all these </v>

1533
01:06:16.310 --> 01:06:17.971
<v Speaker 4>sewers on fire that's going to work like</v>
<v Speaker 4>a little kid then?</v>

1534
01:06:18.091 --> 01:06:19.450
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like a little kid solution.</v>

1535
01:06:20.650 --> 01:06:22.600
<v Speaker 4>Just fucking poor gasoline in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>sewage,</v>

1536
01:06:22.990 --> 01:06:25.390
<v Speaker 4>but there's certain problems that we </v>
<v Speaker 4>just don't have an answer to.</v>

1537
01:06:25.420 --> 01:06:29.050
<v Speaker 4>That's the problem of rats in cities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't have an answer to.</v>

1538
01:06:29.530 --> 01:06:33.490
<v Speaker 4>I mean you can mitigate it by </v>
<v Speaker 4>controlling your trash or this or that.</v>

1539
01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:37.690
<v Speaker 4>There's a few things you could do to </v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of keep them like at least at bay,</v>

1540
01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:40.510
<v Speaker 4>but they're going to be hungry and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're going to be searching around and</v>

1541
01:06:40.511 --> 01:06:41.950
<v Speaker 4>people are always going to leave </v>
<v Speaker 4>garbage.</v>

1542
01:06:41.951 --> 01:06:43.720
<v Speaker 4>There's always going to be food in New </v>
<v Speaker 4>York,</v>

1543
01:06:44.050 --> 01:06:44.980
<v Speaker 4>in New York City.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1544
01:06:46.060 --> 01:06:51.060
<v Speaker 4>So much filth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many rats do you think are in </v>

1545
01:06:51.060 --> 01:06:51.060
<v Speaker 4>Manhattan?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1546
01:06:51.060 --> 01:06:53.910
<v Speaker 4>let's see how many people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's $7,000,000.</v>

1547
01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:56.620
<v Speaker 4>This is about eight point 6 million pa </v>
<v Speaker 4>point 6 million people.</v>

1548
01:06:56.830 --> 01:07:01.780
<v Speaker 4>I'd say 13 million rats come.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to go with 24.</v>

1549
01:07:02.350 --> 01:07:06.970
<v Speaker 4>This estimate says there are </v>
<v Speaker 4>approximately 33 point $6 million,</v>

1550
01:07:06.971 --> 01:07:09.490
<v Speaker 4>which is as many as five rats per </v>
<v Speaker 4>person.</v>

1551
01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:14.560
<v Speaker 4>So many.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 4>And there's different ones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uptown and downtown.</v>

1554
01:07:18.521 --> 01:07:23.521
<v Speaker 4>There's a dip.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Genetically Genetically Distinguishable </v>

1555
01:07:23.521 --> 01:07:26.431
<v Speaker 4>groups.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many groups to to genetically </v>

1556
01:07:26.431 --> 01:07:26.680
<v Speaker 4>distinguishable groups of uptown and </v>

<v Speaker 4>feeling of panic and like moving </v>

1563

<v Speaker 2>You're a real person.</v>

1664
01:11:49.411 --> 01:11:51.780
<v Speaker 2>Real fake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fake.</v>

1665
01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:57.480
<v Speaker 2>It looks real fake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think it's just shitty shitty </v>

1666
01:11:57.480 --> 01:11:57.480
<v Speaker 2>photography and they probably added </v>
<v Speaker 2>color to it later.</v>

1667
01:11:58.770 --> 01:12:03.770
<v Speaker 2>So Tommy buttons yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tell me about the controversy </v>

1668
01:12:03.770 --> 01:12:06.150
<v Speaker 2>surrounding your use of the r word in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your last special.</v>

1669
01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:09.450
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was good that that was,</v>

1670
01:12:09.780 --> 01:12:12.180
<v Speaker 2>that was bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a lot man.</v>

1671
01:12:12.410 --> 01:12:14.340
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it was also.</v>

1672
01:12:14.550 --> 01:12:19.550
<v Speaker 2>What I found interesting about it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>people were lying about the bit and they</v>

1673
01:12:21.001 --> 01:12:25.200
<v Speaker 2>were doing it in articles and they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it in email campaigns.</v>

1674
01:12:25.201 --> 01:12:26.970
<v Speaker 2>They were lying about the content of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>bit.</v>

1675
01:12:27.650 --> 01:12:30.690
<v Speaker 2>There were changing what you were saying</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the bit and the.</v>

1676
01:12:30.691 --> 01:12:35.691
<v Speaker 2>They had to be doing it on purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They definitely didn't listen to the </v>

1677
01:12:35.691 --> 01:12:35.691
<v Speaker 2>bit.</v>

1678
01:12:35.691 --> 01:12:36.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think it took me a while to figure</v>

1679
01:12:36.611 --> 01:12:41.611
<v Speaker 3>out what was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what really was happening was that </v>

1680
01:12:41.611 --> 01:12:45.420
<v Speaker 3>someone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone's agenda or idea of what they </v>

1681
01:12:45.420 --> 01:12:49.201
<v Speaker 3>want to accomplish is to highlight a </v>
<v Speaker 3>campaign to eradicate saying a word and </v>

1682
01:12:50.951 --> 01:12:55.951
<v Speaker 3>then they had a channel to pursue by </v>
<v Speaker 3>having a comedy bit that did it,</v>

1683
01:12:58.450 --> 01:12:59.920
<v Speaker 3>but they could be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>

1684
01:12:59.970 --> 01:13:01.670
<v Speaker 3>let's go after it like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1685
01:13:01.870 --> 01:13:03.250
<v Speaker 3>but it didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't go.</v>

1686
01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:04.690
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1687
01:13:05.020 --> 01:13:07.480
<v Speaker 3>basically what it was funny thing is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that like the,</v>

1688
01:13:07.540 --> 01:13:12.540
<v Speaker 3>that joke was something that I worked </v>
<v Speaker 3>back when I did that bit backwards.</v>

1689
01:13:14.530 --> 01:13:18.280
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had the end piece of the bit,</v>

1690
01:13:18.660 --> 01:13:21.100
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was that while I was doing by itself,</v>

1691
01:13:21.370 --> 01:13:24.790
<v Speaker 3>which was a story about I saw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I witnessed a fight in Philly,</v>

1692
01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:26.950
<v Speaker 3>have a white guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a black guy in the park,</v>

1693
01:13:27.370 --> 01:13:30.700
<v Speaker 3>and the white dude was screaming and </v>
<v Speaker 3>bombs and it was,</v>

1694
01:13:30.730 --> 01:13:31.480
<v Speaker 3>it was nuts.</v>

1695
01:13:31.690 --> 01:13:34.140
<v Speaker 3>So I would tell that story and then I </v>
<v Speaker 3>would,</v>

1696
01:13:34.190 --> 01:13:37.920
<v Speaker 3>I worked backwards into getting into the</v>
<v Speaker 3>story because I always try to figure out</v>

1697
01:13:37.930 --> 01:13:41.620
<v Speaker 3>like if something funny happens or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something I want to tell a story,</v>

1698
01:13:41.890 --> 01:13:46.890
<v Speaker 3>it's always better to figure out why are</v>
<v Speaker 3>you telling the story than just to be </v>

1699
01:13:46.890 --> 01:13:46.890
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the story.</v>

1700
01:13:46.890 --> 01:13:49.090
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I told the story of the,</v>

1701
01:13:49.180 --> 01:13:52.150
<v Speaker 3>the fight in the park.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then I worked into,</v>

1702
01:13:52.180 --> 01:13:56.140
<v Speaker 3>like I figured out right before that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about racial slurs and how,</v>

1703
01:13:56.680 --> 01:13:59.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most racial slurs are not acceptable.</v>

1704
01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:04.200
<v Speaker 3>And then I figured out they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless they're like white racial slurs </v>

1705
01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:08.431
<v Speaker 3>are totally acceptable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like call people mix and crowds and </v>

1706
01:14:08.431 --> 01:14:11.510
<v Speaker 3>frogs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>polacks Guinea wipes like this whole </v>

1707
01:14:11.510 --> 01:14:11.510
<v Speaker 3>list of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I worked before that,</v>

1708
01:14:11.510 --> 01:14:16.230
<v Speaker 3>just the way into saying that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why should talk about words that you </v>

1709
01:14:16.230 --> 01:14:18.640
<v Speaker 3>can't say that that kind of changed over</v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

1710
01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:21.790
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was just like one of those jokes.</v>

1711
01:14:21.791 --> 01:14:22.120
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1712
01:14:22.121 --> 01:14:24.460
<v Speaker 3>it's helping me get into the bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

1713
01:14:24.461 --> 01:14:24.920
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1714
01:14:25.250 --> 01:14:27.690
<v Speaker 3>I started the bit by saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1715
01:14:27.700 --> 01:14:29.450
<v Speaker 3>you can't say retarded anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does the,</v>

1716
01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:31.990
<v Speaker 3>that's the first line of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the entire bit,</v>

1717
01:14:32.410 --> 01:14:34.300
<v Speaker 3>which ended up being like eight or 10 </v>
<v Speaker 3>minutes long.</v>

1718
01:14:34.870 --> 01:14:38.150
<v Speaker 3>And then people would say to me like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to start with,</v>

1719
01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:39.820
<v Speaker 3>when I started getting mail about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>

1720
01:14:39.821 --> 01:14:40.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't say retarded.</v>

1721
01:14:40.851 --> 01:14:43.240
<v Speaker 3>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the line that I say like,</v>

1722
01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:45.190
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the line in the joke.</v>

1723
01:14:45.340 --> 01:14:48.400
<v Speaker 3>But they didn't hear the bet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He will just heard that you were doing a</v>

1724
01:14:48.401 --> 01:14:51.700
<v Speaker 3>bit about the word retarded once it blew</v>
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

1725
01:14:51.910 --> 01:14:56.890
<v Speaker 3>Like once it got to a huge amount of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1726
01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:59.530
<v Speaker 3>like when it was an organized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>orchestrated campaign,</v>

1727
01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:02.650
<v Speaker 3>you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was people messaging me that would</v>

1728
01:15:02.651 --> 01:15:03.310
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1729
01:15:03.380 --> 01:15:06.790
<v Speaker 3>I heard you want to kill all children </v>
<v Speaker 3>with down's.</v>

1730
01:15:06.790 --> 01:15:07.540
<v Speaker 3>And I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

1731
01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:10.820
<v Speaker 3>where did you see that facebook </v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere said it.</v>

1732
01:15:10.821 --> 01:15:15.821
<v Speaker 3>Someone said it does have the message </v>
<v Speaker 3>messages I started to get and how many </v>

1733
01:15:15.821 --> 01:15:18.691
<v Speaker 3>people at the height of it sign this </v>
<v Speaker 3>petition to get you kicked off in that </v>

1734
01:15:18.691 --> 01:15:20.530
<v Speaker 3>floats over 100,000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1735
01:15:21.730 --> 01:15:23.140
<v Speaker 3>But here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's what I mean.</v>

1736
01:15:23.380 --> 01:15:27.700
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to portray myself as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>victim or anything,</v>

1737
01:15:27.701 --> 01:15:28.360
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I,</v>

1738
01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:33.840
<v Speaker 3>I did a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can handle people not liking it or </v>

1739
01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:33.840
<v Speaker 3>liking it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1740
01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:37.291
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people message me that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were into it and I just didn't share </v>

1741
01:15:37.291 --> 01:15:39.130
<v Speaker 3>those because you don't want to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's someone who said they like it,</v>

1742
01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:41.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and people and people,</v>

1743
01:15:41.711 --> 01:15:44.710
<v Speaker 3>even people with a children and siblings</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1744
01:15:44.711 --> 01:15:45.540
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1745
01:15:45.670 --> 01:15:47.170
<v Speaker 3>with downstream messaged me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1746
01:15:47.171 --> 01:15:50.470
<v Speaker 3>I just didn't post those messages.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I don't know,</v>

1747
01:15:51.010 --> 01:15:56.010
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not the victim in this whole thing </v>

1748
01:15:56.010 --> 01:15:56.010
<v Speaker 3>at all.</v>

1749
01:15:56.010 --> 01:15:58.470
<v Speaker 3>I learned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I learned that when people </v>

1750
01:15:58.470 --> 01:16:00.541
<v Speaker 3>are super upset about something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to let them just be upset and </v>

1751
01:16:00.541 --> 01:16:02.350
<v Speaker 3>be outraged if they want to be outraged,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1752
01:16:02.590 --> 01:16:03.310
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're right.</v>

1753
01:16:03.510 --> 01:16:08.510
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course it's uncomfortable to me that </v>

1754
01:16:08.510 --> 01:16:09.100
<v Speaker 3>you can't get out in front and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1755
01:16:09.101 --> 01:16:10.900
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're misrepresenting it.</v>

1756
01:16:11.310 --> 01:16:16.310
<v Speaker 3>Because people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like even in the campaign language it </v>

1757
01:16:16.310 --> 01:16:17.950
<v Speaker 3>said like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we want this bit taken out of the,</v>

1758
01:16:18.010 --> 01:16:23.010
<v Speaker 3>of the joke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We went the trailer for the special </v>

1759
01:16:23.010 --> 01:16:24.790
<v Speaker 3>removed and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>

1760
01:16:25.170 --> 01:16:30.170
<v Speaker 3>And then I realized that the trailer has</v>
<v Speaker 3>a joke that they're confusing with the </v>

1761
01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:34.150
<v Speaker 3>joke where I say retarded,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they're,</v>

1762
01:16:34.300 --> 01:16:36.760
<v Speaker 3>they think the two are related.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the one on the trailer?</v>

1763
01:16:37.100 --> 01:16:38.380
<v Speaker 3>The trailer is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I say,</v>

1764
01:16:38.381 --> 01:16:39.930
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1765
01:16:40.150 --> 01:16:42.580
<v Speaker 3>like some of something's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1766
01:16:42.610 --> 01:16:45.400
<v Speaker 3>disabilities are not funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but some are,</v>

1767
01:16:45.670 --> 01:16:50.670
<v Speaker 3>and it's a whole bit about obscure </v>
<v Speaker 3>things like a foreign accent syndrome </v>

1768
01:16:50.890 --> 01:16:55.890
<v Speaker 3>and oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was hit on the head and then they </v>

1769
01:16:55.890 --> 01:16:55.890
<v Speaker 3>start speaking in French.</v>

1770
01:16:55.890 --> 01:16:57.670
<v Speaker 3>So that was the setup to that bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they were,</v>

1771
01:16:57.880 --> 01:17:02.880
<v Speaker 3>but they were saying they were basically</v>
<v Speaker 3>making it where that setup is about </v>

1772
01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:04.900
<v Speaker 3>downs or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1773
01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:07.030
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they happened 40 minutes apart.</v>

1774
01:17:07.031 --> 01:17:09.740
<v Speaker 3>One has nothing to do with the other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but by not it,</v>

1775
01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:11.600
<v Speaker 3>by just watching the trailer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going,</v>

1776
01:17:11.630 --> 01:17:16.630
<v Speaker 3>oh see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is like how he's making fun of us </v>

1777
01:17:16.630 --> 01:17:19.220
<v Speaker 3>will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You shouldn't even have a point where </v>

1778
01:17:19.220 --> 01:17:19.220
<v Speaker 3>you could say some disabilities are </v>
<v Speaker 3>funny.</v>

1779
01:17:19.220 --> 01:17:19.400
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

1780
01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:20.780
<v Speaker 3>she can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1781
01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:22.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what,</v>

1782
01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:23.420
<v Speaker 3>that's what I was told.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1783
01:17:23.660 --> 01:17:28.660
<v Speaker 3>it's what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the new power that people have to </v>

1784
01:17:28.660 --> 01:17:29.570
<v Speaker 3>complain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean people have always complained but</v>

1785
01:17:29.571 --> 01:17:34.571
<v Speaker 3>they haven't had the instantaneous </v>
<v Speaker 3>access to complaining and then you can </v>

1786
01:17:34.571 --> 01:17:38.531
<v Speaker 3>get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And here's the thing I learned about </v>

1787
01:17:38.531 --> 01:17:39.380
<v Speaker 3>Kinda like mob mentality too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was kind of fascinating to watch.</v>

1788
01:17:39.410 --> 01:17:41.810
<v Speaker 3>I mean I was in it so it's different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once I could step back,</v>

1789
01:17:42.110 --> 01:17:45.980
<v Speaker 3>I realized that once you get signed to a</v>
<v Speaker 3>certain message out,</v>

1790
01:17:46.430 --> 01:17:51.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people would read the thing that says </v>

1791
01:17:51.430 --> 01:17:52.850
<v Speaker 3>this guy hates people with downs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

1792
01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:57.880
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's not a hard thing to get </v>

1793
01:17:57.880 --> 01:17:57.880
<v Speaker 3>behind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

1794
01:17:57.880 --> 01:18:01.630
<v Speaker 3>so then people would just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would sign it and I would also get </v>

1795
01:18:01.630 --> 01:18:03.350
<v Speaker 3>messages that said things like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1796
01:18:03.410 --> 01:18:06.410
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know evil like you existed in </v>
<v Speaker 3>this world,</v>

1797
01:18:06.530 --> 01:18:07.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things like that,</v>

1798
01:18:07.371 --> 01:18:08.240
<v Speaker 3>and I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

<v Speaker 3>And I didn't engage nearly,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1802
01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:19.250
<v Speaker 3>the amount of people that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would contact me.</v>

1803
01:18:19.251 --> 01:18:24.251
<v Speaker 3>But I did engage a few.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did like go back and forth with one </v>

1835
01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:31.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's gotten to the point where you </v>

1836
01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:33.851
<v Speaker 3>don't even say the word Nigger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like just saying it.</v>

1837
01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:36.350
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>a real word.</v>

1841
01:19:45.021 --> 01:19:46.340
<v Speaker 3>It's like a forbidden thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1842
01:19:46.341 --> 01:19:50.390
<v Speaker 3>part of this campaign is to refer to it </v>

1843
01:19:50.410 --> 01:19:50.870
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>

1849
01:19:59.660 --> 01:20:03.190
<v Speaker 3>some people were very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very upset about it and you know,</v>

1850

<v Speaker 3>It's not like I go like,</v>

1852
01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:08.430
<v Speaker 3>I don't even understand how you can be </v>
<v Speaker 3>upset.</v>

1853
01:20:08.700 --> 01:20:13.700
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the natural thing I think if you're a </v>

1854
01:20:13.700 --> 01:20:15.300
<v Speaker 3>comic is you want to walk someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>through the joke,</v>

1855
01:20:15.390 --> 01:20:19.140
<v Speaker 3>but what you realize later is like </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody who's,</v>

1856
01:20:19.320 --> 01:20:24.320
<v Speaker 3>who's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's advocating to stop saying a word </v>

1857
01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:25.860
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't care the details of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>joke.</v>

1858
01:20:25.910 --> 01:20:30.910
<v Speaker 3>I mean the joke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the other thing that sucks about </v>

1859
01:20:30.910 --> 01:20:30.910
<v Speaker 3>reading.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People would read transcripts.</v>

1860
01:20:30.910 --> 01:20:34.230
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>transcripts have no intent tone.</v>

1861
01:20:34.300 --> 01:20:36.450
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you just read people's like,</v>

1862
01:20:36.630 --> 01:20:39.690
<v Speaker 3>I know we've talked about what your </v>
<v Speaker 3>closing on now,</v>

1863
01:20:39.691 --> 01:20:41.160
<v Speaker 3>which will probably close out your </v>
<v Speaker 3>special.</v>

1864
01:20:41.340 --> 01:20:43.320
<v Speaker 3>If you just type that out and give us </v>
<v Speaker 3>the one,</v>

1865
01:20:43.321 --> 01:20:45.010
<v Speaker 3>they'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you like,</v>

1866
01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:49.440
<v Speaker 3>you're a horrible man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's in a couple of days.</v>

1867
01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:54.440
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's in the context of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy show where there's an unspoken </v>

1868
01:20:54.440 --> 01:20:55.770
<v Speaker 3>agreement between performer and </v>
<v Speaker 3>audience.</v>

1869
01:20:56.130 --> 01:20:58.020
<v Speaker 3>It's the intent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>

1870
01:20:58.021 --> 01:21:03.021
<v Speaker 3>How did you intend this bit to go tone?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You mean is it said satirically?</v>

1871
01:21:03.421 --> 01:21:07.570
<v Speaker 3>Ironically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that bit what I'm doing in the bit is,</v>

1872
01:21:07.610 --> 01:21:12.480
<v Speaker 3>is basically lamenting but accepting </v>
<v Speaker 3>that words are changing,</v>

1873
01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:13.740
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that's the tone of it.</v>

1874
01:21:14.070 --> 01:21:16.800
<v Speaker 3>The tone of it is I'm going like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't say retarded anymore.</v>

1875
01:21:16.801 --> 01:21:18.720
<v Speaker 3>That fucking sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I'm also like,</v>

1876
01:21:19.110 --> 01:21:20.460
<v Speaker 3>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

1877
01:21:20.461 --> 01:21:21.780
<v Speaker 3>Like you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1878
01:21:21.810 --> 01:21:24.210
<v Speaker 3>you want to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I make an example.</v>

1879
01:21:24.211 --> 01:21:27.870
<v Speaker 3>Like one thing that people got really </v>
<v Speaker 3>upset about it was like I said,</v>

1880
01:21:27.900 --> 01:21:30.000
<v Speaker 3>at the end of this bit of the retarded </v>
<v Speaker 3>part,</v>

1881
01:21:30.001 --> 01:21:33.180
<v Speaker 3>I say like you got now you got to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

1882
01:21:33.181 --> 01:21:36.930
<v Speaker 3>Your idea has an extra 21st chromosome </v>
<v Speaker 3>if you asked me.</v>

1883
01:21:37.050 --> 01:21:39.390
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the next part,</v>

1884
01:21:40.110 --> 01:21:45.110
<v Speaker 3>the very next line that they would cut </v>
<v Speaker 3>out when people were sharing this thing </v>

1885
01:21:45.110 --> 01:21:48.620
<v Speaker 3>is I go like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not the same meaning that the example </v>

1886
01:21:48.620 --> 01:21:51.810
<v Speaker 3>was they purposely bad example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The joke is that if you were to say 21st</v>

1887
01:21:51.811 --> 01:21:53.490
<v Speaker 3>chromosome,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's absurd.</v>

1888
01:21:53.491 --> 01:21:56.650
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't work like you wouldn't make </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1889
01:21:56.820 --> 01:22:01.820
<v Speaker 3>but people would attack me and go like </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're telling people to start saying </v>

1890
01:22:01.820 --> 01:22:01.820
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1891
01:22:01.820 --> 01:22:02.310
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sharing that.</v>

1892
01:22:02.311 --> 01:22:03.420
<v Speaker 3>It's a bad idea.</v>

1893
01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:08.880
<v Speaker 4>I saw someone getting mad at someone </v>
<v Speaker 4>calling someone stupid because they were</v>

1894
01:22:09.581 --> 01:22:12.820
<v Speaker 4>saying that's ablest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you know what a it is?</v>

1895
01:22:12.890 --> 01:22:14.540
<v Speaker 3>Ablest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1896
01:22:14.541 --> 01:22:17.690
<v Speaker 3>Because you have your of sound.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're able.</v>

1897
01:22:17.900 --> 01:22:18.860
<v Speaker 3>You're able to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1898
01:22:18.930 --> 01:22:20.570
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like a.</v>

1899
01:22:21.060 --> 01:22:25.650
<v Speaker 4>If you are mocking someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 4>diminished mentally.</v>

1900
01:22:26.070 --> 01:22:27.300
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you fucking idiot.</v>

1901
01:22:27.330 --> 01:22:28.310
<v Speaker 4>That's ablest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1902
01:22:28.710 --> 01:22:30.510
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which is crazy.</v>

1903
01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:32.340
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're able bodied.</v>

1904
01:22:32.850 --> 01:22:37.850
<v Speaker 4>Their brain doesn't work so good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're an ableist if you call them </v>

1905
01:22:37.850 --> 01:22:40.821
<v Speaker 4>stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's going to get to the point </v>

1906
01:22:40.821 --> 01:22:42.330
<v Speaker 4>where if you give up certain words,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean if we keep going like this,</v>

1907
01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:47.360
<v Speaker 4>it's going to get to the point where </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're just gonna have a very hard time </v>

1908
01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:47.730
<v Speaker 4>communicating effectively.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I totally agree.</v>

1909
01:22:47.731 --> 01:22:49.380
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1910
01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:54.500
<v Speaker 4>There's an.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's the thing that it is an endless </v>

1911
01:22:54.500 --> 01:22:54.500
<v Speaker 4>cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1912
01:22:54.500 --> 01:22:57.351
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we just don't have that next </v>

1913
01:22:57.351 --> 01:22:57.351
<v Speaker 4>unacceptable word,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1914
01:22:57.351 --> 01:22:58.740
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like everybody knows.</v>

1915
01:22:58.741 --> 01:23:03.741
<v Speaker 4>I think a lot of people know that as far</v>
<v Speaker 4>as somebody who's a doesn't have is </v>

1916
01:23:03.741 --> 01:23:07.120
<v Speaker 4>developmentally disabled.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Retarded was kind of the Mo.</v>

1917
01:23:07.210 --> 01:23:10.900
<v Speaker 4>The latest term that was once acceptable</v>
<v Speaker 4>is clearly not.</v>

1918
01:23:10.900 --> 01:23:12.610
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is kind of the point.</v>

1919
01:23:12.940 --> 01:23:14.200
<v Speaker 4>But before that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1920
01:23:14.290 --> 01:23:17.080
<v Speaker 4>moron was a medical term wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1921
01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:21.790
<v Speaker 4>mongoloid idiot was what they used to </v>
<v Speaker 4>call 'em down syndrome children.</v>

1922
01:23:21.850 --> 01:23:24.820
<v Speaker 4>that was like 100 years ago was on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>birth certificate.</v>

1923
01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:25.720
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I'm saying,</v>

1924
01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:28.570
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people who are saying,</v>

1925
01:23:29.110 --> 01:23:30.670
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just to stop saying return,</v>

1926
01:23:30.700 --> 01:23:35.700
<v Speaker 4>they're not wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there is also another word down the </v>

1927
01:23:36.041 --> 01:23:36.730
<v Speaker 4>pipeline,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1928
01:23:36.731 --> 01:23:41.731
<v Speaker 4>There's something else that's coming </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's going to be a medical word or </v>

1929
01:23:41.731 --> 01:23:43.540
<v Speaker 4>term and then that'll be used to insult </v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

1930
01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:48.600
<v Speaker 4>but that's the way people use language.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like once we identify this is the word </v>

1931
01:23:49.211 --> 01:23:53.710
<v Speaker 4>people use to label someone with a </v>
<v Speaker 4>developmental disability,</v>

1932
01:23:54.040 --> 01:23:58.330
<v Speaker 4>people in the slang will grow from that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People will start using that.</v>

1933
01:23:59.110 --> 01:24:04.110
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's interesting to me is that when </v>

1934
01:24:04.110 --> 01:24:07.350
<v Speaker 4>we're talking about words,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not going to change the way </v>

1935
01:24:07.350 --> 01:24:07.350
<v Speaker 4>people think.</v>

1936
01:24:07.350 --> 01:24:08.310
<v Speaker 4>So words are supposed to convey intent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1937
01:24:08.311 --> 01:24:13.311
<v Speaker 4>Supposed to be sounds that we all agree </v>
<v Speaker 4>mean a certain thing and the more depth,</v>

1938
01:24:15.430 --> 01:24:20.430
<v Speaker 4>the more access towards you have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the more you can sort of flavor your </v>

1939
01:24:20.430 --> 01:24:21.280
<v Speaker 4>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I uNderstand what you're saying.</v>

1940
01:24:21.580 --> 01:24:24.850
<v Speaker 4>Like if you're saying this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I kind of get it,</v>

1941
01:24:24.851 --> 01:24:27.370
<v Speaker 4>but you feel like this fucking guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1942
01:24:27.371 --> 01:24:28.860
<v Speaker 4>well tom is really mad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know whaT I mean?</v>

1943
01:24:28.980 --> 01:24:31.180
<v Speaker 4>That and to take that out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1944
01:24:31.270 --> 01:24:32.860
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1945
01:24:33.350 --> 01:24:37.900
<v Speaker 4>So sometimes you take those things out </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're like on a television show or</v>

1946
01:24:37.901 --> 01:24:41.140
<v Speaker 4>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but all television shows because of that</v>

1947
01:24:41.170 --> 01:24:46.060
<v Speaker 4>all censored television shows only </v>
<v Speaker 4>exists within a certain band.</v>

1948
01:24:46.150 --> 01:24:48.430
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A certain frequency they'd never get out</v>

1949
01:24:48.431 --> 01:24:50.560
<v Speaker 4>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the joey diaz frequency is like,</v>

1950
01:24:50.561 --> 01:24:51.880
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no fucking roof.</v>

1951
01:24:52.210 --> 01:24:54.010
<v Speaker 4>There's no fence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ah,</v>

1952
01:24:54.250 --> 01:24:55.060
<v Speaker 4>true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This,</v>

1953
01:24:55.210 --> 01:24:59.740
<v Speaker 4>this frequency that you get on like late</v>
<v Speaker 4>night talk shows or a sitcom,</v>

1954
01:24:59.980 --> 01:25:04.980
<v Speaker 4>this very narrow band that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that there's no concept in that band.</v>

1955
01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:08.860
<v Speaker 4>There's no motherfucker this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all those things are not in there,</v>

1956
01:25:08.890 --> 01:25:10.840
<v Speaker 4>which is what you're all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like whenever you're.</v>

1957
01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:13.360
<v Speaker 4>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I'm watching something like that,</v>

1958
01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:16.390
<v Speaker 4>part of my Brain is always like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go find a motherfucker somewhere.</v>

1959
01:25:17.150 --> 01:25:19.610

01:25:32.881 --> 01:25:32.881
<v Speaker 4>wife,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your mom's house.</v>

1966
01:25:32.881 --> 01:25:37.380
<v Speaker 4>If anybody just wanted to go cherry pick</v>
<v Speaker 4>things and write them down.</v>

1967
01:25:38.170 --> 01:25:43.170
<v Speaker 4>Write some of the things you guys joke </v>
<v Speaker 4>around about where you're clearly </v>

1968
01:25:43.170 --> 01:25:45.220
<v Speaker 4>joking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but take it and write it down in quotes.</v>

1969
01:25:45.221 --> 01:25:48.310
<v Speaker 4>And then tom said to his wife,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah,</v>

1970
01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:50.290
<v Speaker 4>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>100,000</v>

1971
01:25:50.291 --> 01:25:55.291
<v Speaker 4>times worse than anything in life </v>
<v Speaker 4>stanhope ever said is set on that </v>

1973
01:25:55.291 --> 01:25:58.510
<v Speaker 4>it's not even comparable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so much worse.</v>

1974
01:25:58.540 --> 01:26:03.540
<v Speaker 4>The content.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like we don't go into the show of </v>

1975
01:26:03.540 --> 01:26:03.590
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's be offensive,</v>

1976
01:26:03.890 --> 01:26:04.160
<v Speaker 4>but</v>

1977

<v Speaker 3>we play in a no rules like have fun </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment.</v>

1978
01:26:09.390 --> 01:26:10.880
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like free flowing,</v>

1979
01:26:11.450 --> 01:26:13.490
<v Speaker 3>just say whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's the fun of the show.</v>

1980
01:26:13.730 --> 01:26:18.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's also everybody knows you're </v>

1981
01:26:18.730 --> 01:26:20.810
<v Speaker 3>joking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fan base is like 100 percent on </v>

1982
01:26:20.810 --> 01:26:24.881
<v Speaker 3>board with this is an uncensored just </v>
<v Speaker 3>loose,</v>

1983
01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:27.230
<v Speaker 3>fun going for it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>going for jokes.</v>

1984
01:26:27.290 --> 01:26:31.010
<v Speaker 3>What I also found too is that during </v>
<v Speaker 3>this whole controversy,</v>

1985
01:26:31.011 --> 01:26:35.060
<v Speaker 3>after your special was released,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got bigger.</v>

1986
01:26:35.450 --> 01:26:40.450
<v Speaker 3>It's like people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they by doing that campaign and then </v>

1987
01:26:40.450 --> 01:26:45.040
<v Speaker 3>people who did investigate the guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually this guy was really fucking </v>

1988
01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:45.040
<v Speaker 3>funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I got,</v>

1989
01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:45.800
<v Speaker 3>I usually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1990
01:26:45.801 --> 01:26:50.801
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never publicize these things because </v>

1991
01:26:50.801 --> 01:26:50.801
<v Speaker 3>it's gross,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1992
01:26:50.801 --> 01:26:52.160
<v Speaker 3>to be like check out this compliment or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

1993
01:26:52.790 --> 01:26:55.940
<v Speaker 3>But like I got so manY messages from </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who are like,</v>

1994
01:26:56.210 --> 01:27:01.210
<v Speaker 3>I saw this thing on the news because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was on a lot of local news that there's </v>

1995
01:27:01.210 --> 01:27:03.080
<v Speaker 3>a controversial netflix thing out.</v>

1996
01:27:03.590 --> 01:27:07.130
<v Speaker 3>People would message me and I saw this </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing so I decided to check you out.</v>

1997
01:27:07.131 --> 01:27:12.131
<v Speaker 3>new fan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just bought tickets to see you at blah </v>

1998
01:27:12.131 --> 01:27:14.111
<v Speaker 3>blah blah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I started to get a bunch of messages </v>

1999
01:27:14.111 --> 01:27:17.051
<v Speaker 3>like that for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're going to get 30 percent </v>

2000
01:27:17.051 --> 01:27:17.051
<v Speaker 3>of the people that aren't even going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>read it,</v>

2001
01:27:17.051 --> 01:27:17.300
<v Speaker 3>they're just going to call you piece of </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit,</v>

2002
01:27:17.570 --> 01:27:19.910
<v Speaker 3>but the other people are going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is going on over here?</v>

2003
01:27:19.911 --> 01:27:24.911
<v Speaker 3>And then next thing you know they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to investigate and they got to go </v>

2004
01:27:24.911 --> 01:27:24.911
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're doing.</v>

2005
01:27:24.911 --> 01:27:24.911
<v Speaker 3>This guy dirty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2006
01:27:24.911 --> 01:27:25.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then boom,</v>

2007
01:27:26.420 --> 01:27:29.510
<v Speaker 3>I got a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got a lot of support that I never.</v>

2008
01:27:30.050 --> 01:27:35.050
<v Speaker 3>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never made light of the fact that </v>

2009
01:27:35.050 --> 01:27:35.050
<v Speaker 3>people were being supportive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but people were being very supportive.</v>

2010
01:27:35.050 --> 01:27:36.800
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just seems like there,</v>

2011
01:27:36.860 --> 01:27:41.860
<v Speaker 3>there's different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's different rules now for standup </v>

2012
01:27:41.860 --> 01:27:42.500
<v Speaker 3>and you got to really cover your ass.</v>

2013
01:27:42.620 --> 01:27:47.620
<v Speaker 3>But in your case you did cover your ass </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they disingenuously left that part </v>

2014
01:27:48.111 --> 01:27:50.810
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they deceptively left that out when</v>

2015
01:27:50.811 --> 01:27:52.430
<v Speaker 3>they were writing down what you had </v>
<v Speaker 3>said.</v>

2016
01:27:52.630 --> 01:27:55.070
<v Speaker 3>He didn't put it in the context.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

2017
01:27:55.071 --> 01:27:55.760
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then,</v>

2018
01:27:55.761 --> 01:27:58.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of you goes a man,</v>

2019
01:27:58.281 --> 01:28:03.281
<v Speaker 3>like I'm not trying to paint myself as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>martyr or you know what I mean,</v>

2020
01:28:04.610 --> 01:28:08.240
<v Speaker 3>and like people who are going down this </v>
<v Speaker 3>path of,</v>

2021
01:28:08.780 --> 01:28:13.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have family or friends with a </v>

2022
01:28:13.780 --> 01:28:16.890
<v Speaker 3>disability.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like I'm not gonna my whole thing </v>

2023
01:28:16.890 --> 01:28:20.711
<v Speaker 3>was never to attack them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm not going to try to make it a </v>

2024
01:28:20.711 --> 01:28:23.120
<v Speaker 3>battle that I have to win.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So once,</v>

2025
01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:26.870
<v Speaker 3>once I saw like kind of what I thought </v>
<v Speaker 3>clearly was happening,</v>

2026
01:28:26.900 --> 01:28:27.560
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2027
01:28:27.561 --> 01:28:32.561
<v Speaker 3>just let people vent their frustration </v>
<v Speaker 3>about if it's about me or about what I </v>

2028
01:28:32.561 --> 01:28:33.710
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just let it happen.</v>

2029
01:28:33.860 --> 01:28:34.910
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2030
01:28:34.911 --> 01:28:39.911
<v Speaker 3>because I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't hold it against them that </v>

2031
01:28:39.911 --> 01:28:41.891
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they have that they're upset about </v>

2032
01:28:41.891 --> 01:28:41.891
<v Speaker 3>this issue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2033
01:28:41.891 --> 01:28:43.600
<v Speaker 3>And even though like you're saying your </v>
<v Speaker 3>instinct is,</v>

2034
01:28:43.660 --> 01:28:45.140
<v Speaker 3>is wants to go like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hold on,</v>

2035
01:28:45.170 --> 01:28:47.050
<v Speaker 3>why don't you put it clearly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>RighT.</v>

2036
01:28:47.070 --> 01:28:49.670
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after a moment of it,</v>

2037
01:28:49.671 --> 01:28:52.940
<v Speaker 3>I realized that that wasn't the point </v>
<v Speaker 3>for me in that,</v>

2038
01:28:52.941 --> 01:28:55.070
<v Speaker 3>in that time I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just let people.</v>

2039
01:28:55.440 --> 01:28:57.170
<v Speaker 3>Because I also figured out that if </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

2040
01:28:57.330 --> 01:28:58.940
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people were going to read it,</v>

2041
01:28:59.540 --> 01:29:04.540
<v Speaker 3>say something and go like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy's fucking worst and it's kind </v>

2042
01:29:04.540 --> 01:29:04.540
<v Speaker 3>of feels good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes it'd be like,</v>

2043
01:29:04.540 --> 01:29:06.820
<v Speaker 3>you want to know who the bad guy is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy and I,</v>

2044
01:29:06.860 --> 01:29:08.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though you want to be like,</v>

2045
01:29:08.281 --> 01:29:10.460
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not that bad of a guy a.</v>

2046
01:29:10.680 --> 01:29:15.680
<v Speaker 3>If someone wants to just go there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just kind of have to let it go and </v>

2047
01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:19.050
<v Speaker 3>then let the people who were enjoying it</v>
<v Speaker 3>or who were investigating it and finding</v>

2048
01:29:19.051 --> 01:29:19.440
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2049
01:29:19.441 --> 01:29:21.240
<v Speaker 3>it's a little different than it's being </v>
<v Speaker 3>presented.</v>

2050
01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:22.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>discovery.</v>

2051
01:29:22.750 --> 01:29:23.050
<v Speaker 3>That one.</v>

2052
01:29:23.220 --> 01:29:27.990
<v Speaker 2>There's so many outlets that are looking</v>
<v Speaker 2>for outrageous stories.</v>

2053
01:29:28.110 --> 01:29:29.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>

2054
01:29:29.011 --> 01:29:31.800
<v Speaker 2>More than ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And recreational outlet age,</v>

2055
01:29:32.010 --> 01:29:35.150
<v Speaker 2>recreational outrage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Peddlers or like an an all time high and</v>

2056
01:29:35.151 --> 01:29:36.420
<v Speaker 2>there's so many people out there that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are working.</v>

2057
01:29:36.450 --> 01:29:41.450
<v Speaker 2>The journalists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the writers they work in for these </v>

2058
01:29:41.450 --> 01:29:42.150
<v Speaker 2>websites and they got to produce </v>
<v Speaker 2>content.</v>

2059
01:29:42.151 --> 01:29:42.420
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

2060
01:29:42.470 --> 01:29:47.470
<v Speaker 3>I got to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the one of the most amazing discoveries </v>

2061
01:29:47.470 --> 01:29:51.100
<v Speaker 3>of that process is not the people who </v>
<v Speaker 3>got upset at me and would start whatever</v>

<v Speaker 3>saying pam saying things.</v>

2063

<v Speaker 3>news pieces and also not familiar with </v>

2077
01:30:36.591 --> 01:30:39.590
<v Speaker 2>doing and then pretending that they're </v>

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>elon musk,</v>

2343
01:42:25.301 --> 01:42:29.380
<v Speaker 4>plan for high speed car tunnel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gets initial approvals from la.</v>

2344
01:42:29.440 --> 01:42:32.470
<v Speaker 4>I would like to see the documentary </v>
<v Speaker 4>about the presentation.</v>

2345
01:42:32.560 --> 01:42:37.560
<v Speaker 4>I'd like to see what happens when the </v>
<v Speaker 4>earthquake kits and that thing fills up </v>

2346
01:42:37.560 --> 01:42:38.920
<v Speaker 4>with water rushing towards you and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're on that scooter.</v>

2347
01:42:39.140 --> 01:42:44.140
<v Speaker 4>God damn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Two point seven mile proof of concept </v>

2348
01:42:44.140 --> 01:42:44.140
<v Speaker 4>puddle along alongside polenta.</v>

2349
01:42:45.940 --> 01:42:48.860
<v Speaker 4>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Zero missions.</v>

2350
01:42:48.970 --> 01:42:53.970
<v Speaker 4>High speed underground alternative means</v>
<v Speaker 4>of transit for personal vehicles and </v>

2351
01:42:53.970 --> 01:42:58.351
<v Speaker 4>slash or single rider use according to </v>
<v Speaker 4>urbanize which reported on the approval </v>

2352
01:42:59.050 --> 01:43:00.520
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2353
01:43:00.521 --> 01:43:01.060
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

2354
01:43:01.270 --> 01:43:04.390
<v Speaker 4>what motivates a guy like that to do so </v>
<v Speaker 4>many different things.</v>

2355
01:43:04.391 --> 01:43:05.890
<v Speaker 4>That's what's so confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2356
01:43:05.891 --> 01:43:06.670
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2357
01:43:06.671 --> 01:43:09.490
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it really is that real curious.</v>

2358
01:43:09.550 --> 01:43:11.780
<v Speaker 4>He's an engineer at heart and it's that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

2359
01:43:11.980 --> 01:43:13.910
<v Speaker 4>I think it's the curiosity and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2360
01:43:13.930 --> 01:43:18.930
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the challenge and accomplishing </v>

2361
01:43:18.930 --> 01:43:21.250
<v Speaker 4>something that hasn't been done before </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I want to make it possible.</v>

2362
01:43:21.430 --> 01:43:22.750
<v Speaker 4>I feel like that has to be the real </v>
<v Speaker 4>drive.</v>

2363
01:43:22.751 --> 01:43:25.100
<v Speaker 4>It can't be the money and the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2364
01:43:25.120 --> 01:43:30.120
<v Speaker 4>the stardom of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like he really gets off on how </v>

2365
01:43:30.120 --> 01:43:30.760
<v Speaker 4>can I find a solution to this thing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2366
01:43:30.761 --> 01:43:32.860
<v Speaker 4>well they're all technologically based </v>
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

2367
01:43:33.160 --> 01:43:35.960
<v Speaker 4>Everything he's doing is like tesla,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the tesla,</v>

2368
01:43:36.250 --> 01:43:38.470
<v Speaker 4>those home units,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the tiles,</v>

2369
01:43:38.500 --> 01:43:42.850
<v Speaker 4>the solar tiles that he's putting on </v>
<v Speaker 4>people's roofs and also it all ties into</v>

2370
01:43:42.970 --> 01:43:45.030
<v Speaker 4>better for humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2371
01:43:45.230 --> 01:43:46.720
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was amazing.</v>

2372
01:43:47.050 --> 01:43:47.550
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's an,</v>

2373
01:43:47.620 --> 01:43:49.780
<v Speaker 4>he's an incredibly lucky that we got a </v>
<v Speaker 4>guy like that.</v>

2374
01:43:49.781 --> 01:43:52.310
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's essentially like our version</v>

2375
01:43:52.310 --> 01:43:57.310
<v Speaker 2>of a tesla.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nikola tesla guy just keeps coming up </v>

2376
01:43:57.310 --> 01:44:01.430
<v Speaker 2>with new crazier shit to just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

2377
01:44:01.820 --> 01:44:04.040
<v Speaker 2>there's only one of those guys though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

2378
01:44:04.460 --> 01:44:09.460
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other ones like you would think </v>

2379
01:44:09.460 --> 01:44:09.460
<v Speaker 2>there'd be a bunch of those kind of guys</v>
<v Speaker 2>now he's.</v>

2380
01:44:09.550 --> 01:44:11.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if he wasn't born?</v>

2381
01:44:13.130 --> 01:44:15.690
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when,</v>

2382
01:44:15.860 --> 01:44:18.440
<v Speaker 2>when you have a guy who's that much of </v>
<v Speaker 2>an outlier,</v>

2383
01:44:19.060 --> 01:44:22.310
<v Speaker 2>it's just so it's so strange because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're forced to consider like how,</v>

2384
01:44:22.390 --> 01:44:24.800
<v Speaker 2>how is kind of creePy and a nation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>300,</v>

2385
01:44:24.801 --> 01:44:28.310
<v Speaker 2>20 million people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that one individual be such an outlier,</v>

2386
01:44:28.970 --> 01:44:33.970
<v Speaker 2>but even I would even outside of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's not even someone like really </v>

2387
01:44:33.970 --> 01:44:34.650
<v Speaker 2>liked him somewhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's really like,</v>

2388
01:44:34.930 --> 01:44:36.800
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 7 billion people.</v>

2389
01:44:36.900 --> 01:44:37.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2390
01:44:37.731 --> 01:44:42.731
<v Speaker 2>Who is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is the one person that you think of </v>

2391
01:44:42.731 --> 01:44:45.250
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to technological </v>
<v Speaker 2>innovation and and producing crazy new </v>

2392
01:44:45.250 --> 01:44:49.070
<v Speaker 2>inventions and using them to the public </v>
<v Speaker 2>of jobs like that.</v>

2393
01:44:49.070 --> 01:44:51.100
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it Was sorta,</v>

2394
01:44:51.310 --> 01:44:56.310
<v Speaker 2>sorta.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't do it the way that this guy </v>

2395
01:44:56.310 --> 01:44:57.881
<v Speaker 2>does know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was just within my company is new </v>

2396
01:44:57.881 --> 01:44:57.881
<v Speaker 2>shit you're going to want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2397
01:44:57.950 --> 01:45:00.460
<v Speaker 2>That was really him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

2398
01:45:00.461 --> 01:45:05.461
<v Speaker 2>You see so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So many people talking shit about apple </v>

2399
01:45:05.461 --> 01:45:05.461
<v Speaker 2>lately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but their laptops,</v>

2400
01:45:05.461 --> 01:45:09.020
<v Speaker 2>people are just tired of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm tired of the lack of innovation.</v>

2401
01:45:09.021 --> 01:45:13.370
<v Speaker 2>It's just all the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the mac books look the same but by a</v>

2402
01:45:13.371 --> 01:45:18.371
<v Speaker 2>windows laptop you by infinite variety,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of different types and styles and </v>

2403
01:45:18.371 --> 01:45:22.700
<v Speaker 2>macbook air.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thirteen inch or 15 inch macbook pro was</v>

2404
01:45:22.730 --> 01:45:25.830
<v Speaker 2>considered kind of a dud I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I know that sucks.</v>

2405
01:45:25.870 --> 01:45:30.870
<v Speaker 2>Home pod didn't sell well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They thought that it was going to be a </v>

2406
01:45:30.870 --> 01:45:33.221
<v Speaker 2>big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the thing where it's like </v>

2407
01:45:33.221 --> 01:45:35.320
<v Speaker 2>you only have so much momentum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's by jobs and then the new guy tim </v>

2408
01:45:35.361 --> 01:45:40.361
<v Speaker 2>cook has to takeover and he's got to </v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out a way to keep that thing </v>

2409
01:45:40.361 --> 01:45:42.590
<v Speaker 2>rolling and it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not the same guy.</v>

2410
01:45:42.820 --> 01:45:44.640
<v Speaker 2>it seems like way healthier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

2411
01:45:45.340 --> 01:45:46.430
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not,</v>

2412
01:45:46.431 --> 01:45:47.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean healthier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just physically,</v>

2413
01:45:47.961 --> 01:45:49.070
<v Speaker 2>but mentally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not.</v>

2414
01:45:49.130 --> 01:45:50.780
<v Speaker 2>He's not obsessed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2415
01:45:50.860 --> 01:45:51.800
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2416
01:45:51.980 --> 01:45:53.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because jobs was obsessed.</v>

2417
01:45:54.230 --> 01:45:56.480
<v Speaker 2>You need to be obsessed to be that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2418
01:45:57.360 --> 01:46:02.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's probably one of the things that </v>

2419
01:46:02.360 --> 01:46:02.360
<v Speaker 2>made them sick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was your take on it and you know,</v>

2420
01:46:02.360 --> 01:46:03.110
<v Speaker 2>you've probably already talked about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so sorry if you did,</v>

2421
01:46:03.111 --> 01:46:07.100

<v Speaker 2>And the story behind it is that artem </v>

2424
01:46:16.240 --> 01:46:20.021
<v Speaker 2>low bob,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is one of connor stablemates,</v>

2425
01:46:21.080 --> 01:46:26.080
<v Speaker 2>had an issue with khabib number go </v>
<v Speaker 2>madoff because he said something in an </v>

2426
01:46:26.090 --> 01:46:28.880
<v Speaker 2>interview that could be pulled out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fights and the conners,</v>

2427
01:46:28.881 --> 01:46:32.660
<v Speaker 2>the real real fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then khabib's a coward,</v>

2428
01:46:32.870 --> 01:46:36.290
<v Speaker 2>so could be found him and kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>smacked him a little.</v>

2429
01:46:36.440 --> 01:46:39.080
<v Speaker 2>Said you'd call me a coward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker like that kind of shit,</v>

2430
01:46:39.530 --> 01:46:41.090
<v Speaker 2>and there's a video of him saying it to </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

2431
01:46:41.091 --> 01:46:46.091
<v Speaker 2>talking to them in russian and connor </v>
<v Speaker 2>saw that video and flew from Ireland </v>

<v Speaker 2>the way to New York to crazy.</v>

2433
01:46:51.510 --> 01:46:56.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There might've been some substances </v>

2434
01:46:56.510 --> 01:46:56.510
<v Speaker 2>involved.</v>

2435
01:46:56.790 --> 01:46:57.910
<v Speaker 2>Not good though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2436
01:46:58.020 --> 01:47:03.020
<v Speaker 2>I mean he might.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He literally might wind up wind up in </v>

2437
01:47:03.020 --> 01:47:05.031
<v Speaker 2>jail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's entirely possible that new york's </v>

2438
01:47:05.031 --> 01:47:05.031
<v Speaker 2>going to prosecute him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that was like a salt.</v>

2439
01:47:05.031 --> 01:47:09.620
<v Speaker 2>he threw a dolly at a car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People get their eyes cut their face </v>

2440
01:47:09.620 --> 01:47:09.620
<v Speaker 2>cut.</v>

<v Speaker 2>And luckily it wasn't.</v>

2443
01:47:13.220 --> 01:47:18.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to Say it any better that </v>

2444
01:47:18.220 --> 01:47:18.220
<v Speaker 2>men get cut,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but imagine if he did it to rose.</v>

2445
01:47:18.220 --> 01:47:18.220
<v Speaker 2>Nama.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eunice,</v>

<v Speaker 2>she's beautiful little 24 year old girl </v>
<v Speaker 2>who's a world champion would have.</v>

2447
01:47:23.431 --> 01:47:26.070
<v Speaker 2>she got cut by the glass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if he ruined her career?</v>

2448
01:47:26.400 --> 01:47:28.620
<v Speaker 2>Like what if she never got to fight </v>
<v Speaker 2>again with the glass?</v>

2449
01:47:28.621 --> 01:47:33.230
<v Speaker 2>Cut her eye and we lost rose and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>would've been the day of or day before a</v>

2450
01:47:33.231 --> 01:47:34.430
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Before a fight.</v>

2451
01:47:34.650 --> 01:47:39.650
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she thought about pulling out of the </v>

2452
01:47:39.650 --> 01:47:39.650
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>

2453
01:47:39.650 --> 01:47:40.590
<v Speaker 2>She was so distraught by the whole event</v>
<v Speaker 2>that she really pulling out.</v>

2454
01:47:40.591 --> 01:47:41.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because she was on that bus.</v>

2455
01:47:42.030 --> 01:47:43.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2456
01:47:45.610 --> 01:47:47.130
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely not going to get them.</v>

2457
01:47:47.131 --> 01:47:50.520
<v Speaker 2>I guess I don't know it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then in a way it does.</v>

2458
01:47:50.670 --> 01:47:52.320
<v Speaker 2>I know there's people who are talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

2459
01:47:52.350 --> 01:47:57.350
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is all coordinated planned like </v>

2460
01:47:57.350 --> 01:47:57.350
<v Speaker 2>teams on your rent press thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2461
01:47:57.350 --> 01:47:59.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can definitely see how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how it could be.</v>

2462
01:47:59.970 --> 01:48:01.080
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't,</v>

2463
01:48:01.230 --> 01:48:02.130
<v Speaker 2>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2464
01:48:02.810 --> 01:48:04.880
<v Speaker 2>it's just not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it.</v>

2465
01:48:04.881 --> 01:48:06.840
<v Speaker 2>It's not gonna is it gonna lower his </v>
<v Speaker 2>draw.</v>

2466
01:48:06.930 --> 01:48:10.110
<v Speaker 2>Probably gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's gonna be even bigger than ever.</v>

2467
01:48:10.111 --> 01:48:12.810
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when he actually does fight khabib,</v>

2468
01:48:13.220 --> 01:48:16.110
<v Speaker 2>if those to do fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if let's say,</v>

2469
01:48:17.890 --> 01:48:21.760
<v Speaker 2>let's say they solve everything civilly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning connor pays everybody off,</v>

2470
01:48:21.850 --> 01:48:25.660
<v Speaker 2>pays off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pays ray borg off.</v>

2471
01:48:25.930 --> 01:48:29.530
<v Speaker 2>Pays off emotional duress to anyone who </v>
<v Speaker 2>sues him.</v>

2472
01:48:29.531 --> 01:48:34.531
<v Speaker 2>That was on the bus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>PaY some sort of a fine to the state of </v>

2473
01:48:34.531 --> 01:48:35.590
<v Speaker 2>New York.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That'S pretty significant.</v>

2474
01:48:35.890 --> 01:48:38.050
<v Speaker 2>Gives up a few million dollars for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2475
01:48:38.470 --> 01:48:43.470
<v Speaker 2>Then they put the fight together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be giant.</v>

2476
01:48:44.250 --> 01:48:46.060
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be giant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that would be the rule.</v>

2477
01:48:47.530 --> 01:48:51.220
<v Speaker 2>Conor mcgregor's comeback fight as </v>
<v Speaker 2>already being mooted as.</v>

2478
01:48:51.520 --> 01:48:55.180
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean as the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 2>record breaker in ufc history?</v>

2479
01:48:55.181 --> 01:48:56.720
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen that word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mu did.</v>

2480
01:48:58.120 --> 01:48:59.920
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever seen it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it means touted it,</v>

2481
01:48:59.921 --> 01:49:04.921
<v Speaker 2>but never seen it either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The biggest record breaker in ufc </v>

<v Speaker 2>If he fights khabib.</v>

2484
01:49:07.210 --> 01:49:12.210
<v Speaker 2>Experts are predicting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'll be back in the octagon within a </v>

2485
01:49:12.210 --> 01:49:12.210
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2486
01:49:12.210 --> 01:49:14.200

<v Speaker 2>that's not a like a much of a stretch.</v>

2487
01:49:15.710 --> 01:49:17.790

<v Speaker 2>potentially.</v>

<v Speaker 2>big as local news.</v>

2536
01:51:29.390 --> 01:51:32.650
<v Speaker 2>Local news is huge at at forming </v>
<v Speaker 2>opinions,</v>

2537
01:51:32.651 --> 01:51:33.750
<v Speaker 2>which I believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2538
01:51:33.980 --> 01:51:35.730
<v Speaker 2>I believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

2539
01:51:35.850 --> 01:51:40.850
<v Speaker 2>It's so fascinating to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then this facebook thing is </v>

2540
01:51:40.850 --> 01:51:44.231
<v Speaker 2>fascinating to me too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we were talking about facebook </v>

2541
01:51:44.231 --> 01:51:44.450
<v Speaker 2>yesterday that what we were watching </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

2542
01:51:45.130 --> 01:51:47.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he was being grilled zuckerberg.</v>

2543
01:51:47.330 --> 01:51:52.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things they were talking </v>

2544
01:51:52.330 --> 01:51:52.330
<v Speaker 2>about his upcoming elections </v>
<v Speaker 2>internationally.</v>

2545
01:51:52.330 --> 01:51:52.520
<v Speaker 2>He's talking about how facebook has </v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

2546
01:51:52.790 --> 01:51:57.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to concentrate and all these </v>

2547
01:51:57.790 --> 01:51:58.820
<v Speaker 2>upcoming elections and make sure there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>no bad actors that are like what?</v>

2548
01:51:58.880 --> 01:52:02.720
<v Speaker 2>Like facebook is involved in shaping the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

2549
01:52:02.750 --> 01:52:04.090
<v Speaker 2>It'S incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2550
01:52:04.580 --> 01:52:05.030
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see,</v>

2551
01:52:05.031 --> 01:52:10.031
<v Speaker 2>I saw an article about how they said </v>
<v Speaker 2>that these senators that grilled him </v>

2552
01:52:10.760 --> 01:52:13.580
<v Speaker 2>miss so many things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically because they're old,</v>

2553
01:52:13.850 --> 01:52:18.850
<v Speaker 2>they're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't ask so many questions </v>

2554
01:52:18.850 --> 01:52:19.730
<v Speaker 2>because they don't understand how </v>
<v Speaker 2>facebook works.</v>

2555
01:52:20.180 --> 01:52:22.610
<v Speaker 2>There's a funny video that I put up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jamie,</v>

2556
01:52:22.730 --> 01:52:27.730
<v Speaker 2>you find it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's on twitter of some of the more </v>

2557
01:52:27.730 --> 01:52:31.511
<v Speaker 2>hilarious things that came out of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>interaction and one of them was the guy </v>

2558
01:52:31.641 --> 01:52:36.641
<v Speaker 2>asks a zuckerberg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you tell us the hotel you're </v>

<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

01:52:49.500 --> 01:52:50.180
<v Speaker 1>I'Ll get to that part,</v>

01:52:56.860 --> 01:52:57.470
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>

<v Speaker 2>back it up.</v>

2569
01:53:00.640 --> 01:53:04.120
<v Speaker 12>That's nine fertilizer or campaign,</v>
<v Speaker 12>uh,</v>

2570
01:53:04.210 --> 01:53:05.420
<v Speaker 12>who,</v>
<v Speaker 12>who asks for it?</v>

2571
01:53:05.830 --> 01:53:08.740
<v Speaker 12>Mr zuckerberg,</v>
<v Speaker 12>would you be comfortable sharing with us</v>

2572
01:53:08.741 --> 01:53:10.480
<v Speaker 12>the name of the hotel you stayed in last</v>
<v Speaker 12>night?</v>

2573
01:53:15.550 --> 01:53:17.530
<v Speaker 11>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 11>no.</v>

2574
01:53:20.090 --> 01:53:24.470
<v Speaker 12>If you've messaged anybody this week,</v>
<v Speaker 12>would you share with us the names of the</v>

2575
01:53:24.471 --> 01:53:25.340
<v Speaker 12>people you've messaged?</v>

2576
01:53:26.670 --> 01:53:27.290
<v Speaker 2>Senator?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2577
01:53:27.291 --> 01:53:29.870
<v Speaker 2>I would probably not choose to do that </v>
<v Speaker 2>publicly here.</v>

2578
01:53:30.160 --> 01:53:30.410
<v Speaker 2>I think</v>

2579
01:53:30.660 --> 01:53:32.250
<v Speaker 12>maybe what this is all about,</v>

2580
01:53:32.870 --> 01:53:34.850
<v Speaker 5>here's what everybody's been trying to </v>
<v Speaker 5>tell you.</v>

2581
01:53:34.851 --> 01:53:35.570
<v Speaker 5>That,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I,</v>

2582
01:53:35.690 --> 01:53:40.690
<v Speaker 5>I say this gently,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your user agreement shocks.</v>

2583
01:53:44.120 --> 01:53:49.120
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to suggest to you that you go </v>
<v Speaker 5>back home and rewrite it until you're </v>

2584
01:53:49.550 --> 01:53:51.190
<v Speaker 5>$1,200</v>
<v Speaker 5>an hour lawyers.</v>

2585
01:53:51.200 --> 01:53:52.970
<v Speaker 5>No disrespect,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're good,</v>

2586
01:53:53.840 --> 01:53:58.840
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but tell hIm you want it written in </v>

2587
01:53:58.840 --> 01:54:00.941
<v Speaker 5>english and swahili so the average </v>
<v Speaker 5>american can understand that would be a </v>

2588
01:54:02.691 --> 01:54:04.600
<v Speaker 5>start quite a story,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2589
01:54:08.540 --> 01:54:10.520
<v Speaker 2>There's no competition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what's really weird.</v>

2590
01:54:10.720 --> 01:54:12.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like as far as like,</v>

2591
01:54:12.260 --> 01:54:13.790
<v Speaker 2>there's twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2592
01:54:13.820 --> 01:54:18.820
<v Speaker 2>that is just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's cool that we have these three </v>

2593
01:54:18.820 --> 01:54:18.820
<v Speaker 2>different ones too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really fascinating.</v>

2594
01:54:19.640 --> 01:54:22.130
<v Speaker 2>You got twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is just some text,</v>

2595
01:54:22.340 --> 01:54:25.790
<v Speaker 2>like I saw this article,</v>
<v Speaker 2>check it out and then people retweet it.</v>

2596
01:54:25.791 --> 01:54:27.770
<v Speaker 2>I liked that aspect of the product.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

2597
01:54:27.771 --> 01:54:29.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could state your opinion on things,</v>

2598
01:54:29.841 --> 01:54:34.250
<v Speaker 2>you could clarify things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then there is instagram,</v>

2599
01:54:34.280 --> 01:54:35.620
<v Speaker 2>just photos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2600
01:54:35.750 --> 01:54:39.700
<v Speaker 2>this is my time in Peru,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at the beautiful buildings.</v>

2601
01:54:39.701 --> 01:54:41.180
<v Speaker 2>They own that one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not a competitor.</v>

2602
01:54:41.210 --> 01:54:43.260
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean the three different things.</v>

2603
01:54:43.990 --> 01:54:48.990
<v Speaker 2>And then there's facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is like a lot of arguments in </v>

2604
01:54:48.990 --> 01:54:50.260
<v Speaker 2>discussions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deep discussion,</v>

2605
01:54:50.300 --> 01:54:53.120
<v Speaker 2>politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like the big one when it comes to</v>

2606
01:54:53.121 --> 01:54:55.640
<v Speaker 2>like deep political discussions.</v>

2607
01:54:57.420 --> 01:55:02.420
<v Speaker 2>It's a wonder what is coming next </v>
<v Speaker 2>because these we typically people try to</v>

2608
01:55:02.890 --> 01:55:05.020
<v Speaker 2>my goals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you're right.</v>

2609
01:55:05.021 --> 01:55:07.090
<v Speaker 2>But I feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

2610
01:55:07.150 --> 01:55:09.010
<v Speaker 2>they have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have a pretty strong grip.</v>

2611
01:55:09.011 --> 01:55:09.460
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2612
01:55:09.461 --> 01:55:14.461
<v Speaker 2>snapchat is really popular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as soon as snapchat looked like it </v>

2613
01:55:14.461 --> 01:55:19.081
<v Speaker 2>was about to just really explode an </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning that it would be the kind of </v>

2614
01:55:19.210 --> 01:55:21.100
<v Speaker 2>premier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2615
01:55:21.160 --> 01:55:23.680
<v Speaker 2>a visual one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instagram was like,</v>

2616
01:55:23.681 --> 01:55:26.470
<v Speaker 2>we're going to add that that same,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2617
01:55:26.740 --> 01:55:31.740
<v Speaker 2>aspect to instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instagram stories just squashed that </v>

2618
01:55:31.740 --> 01:55:33.730
<v Speaker 2>squashed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instagram's a better platform.</v>

2619
01:55:34.570 --> 01:55:39.570
<v Speaker 2>But it's just really interesting to see </v>
<v Speaker 2>like what we choose to put our time and </v>

2620
01:55:39.570 --> 01:55:42.910
<v Speaker 2>our energy and where it's going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when Is the first virtual reality or</v>

2621
01:55:42.930 --> 01:55:47.930
<v Speaker 2>augmented reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>social network going to what's got to be</v>

2622
01:55:48.660 --> 01:55:53.660
<v Speaker 2>around the corner?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They must be scrambling to be the first </v>

2623
01:55:53.660 --> 01:55:53.660
<v Speaker 2>to come up with it.</v>

2624
01:55:53.660 --> 01:55:56.400
<v Speaker 2>Because if you can like if you tried,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a thing called views.</v>

2625
01:55:56.401 --> 01:55:58.470
<v Speaker 2>There still is a Thing called views.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got on it.</v>

2626
01:55:58.471 --> 01:56:03.471
<v Speaker 2>I told them once people get on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't even opened it and fucking </v>

2627
01:56:03.471 --> 01:56:07.401
<v Speaker 2>month if you put a cup v use,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put a couple pictures up and then I </v>

2628
01:56:07.401 --> 01:56:08.700
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gave up.</v>

2629
01:56:08.701 --> 01:56:12.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean I signed up for it but I can't do</v>
<v Speaker 2>another one right now.</v>

2630
01:56:12.450 --> 01:56:16.840
<v Speaker 2>I just can't see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know what it's called.</v>

2631
01:56:16.841 --> 01:56:18.420
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forgot his fucking name.</v>

2632
01:56:18.810 --> 01:56:21.790
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's on that goddamn thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was also confusing,</v>

2633
01:56:21.791 --> 01:56:24.630
<v Speaker 2>like no one could comment on my pictures</v>
<v Speaker 2>and less like accepted them.</v>

2634
01:56:24.900 --> 01:56:27.630
<v Speaker 2>And then I looked at thirtY 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>people to accept.</v>

2635
01:56:27.631 --> 01:56:29.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gotta do one by one.</v>

2636
01:56:29.520 --> 01:56:31.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seemed like it.</v>

2637
01:56:31.860 --> 01:56:34.800
<v Speaker 2>Put them in groups.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh come all the way off.</v>

2638
01:56:34.800 --> 01:56:38.100
<v Speaker 2>Fuck off with that gap all the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck outta here wIth that.</v>

2639
01:56:38.120 --> 01:56:40.500
<v Speaker 2>Am I going to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How am I going to do that with 35,000</v>

2640
01:56:40.501 --> 01:56:42.150
<v Speaker 2>people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>IT might even be more than that now.</v>

2641
01:56:42.330 --> 01:56:44.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know how many I have now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell me how many I have.</v>

2642
01:56:44.850 --> 01:56:47.790
<v Speaker 2>I haven't been there in forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know the name of it.</v>

2643
01:56:48.180 --> 01:56:53.180
<v Speaker 2>Kona views veered so far off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Google views.</v>

2644
01:56:55.620 --> 01:56:57.960
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to figure out how to look to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's Your.</v>

2645
01:56:58.020 --> 01:57:03.020

2646
01:57:03.020 --> 01:57:04.440
<v Speaker 2>instagram added to it seems to be the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most.</v>

2647
01:57:04.441 --> 01:57:05.980
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you can put an image of text,</v>

02:06:31.111 --> 02:06:36.111
<v Speaker 3>on information,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but those animals would get eaten by </v>

2880
02:06:36.111 --> 02:06:36.790
<v Speaker 3>other animals because it's dead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2881
02:06:36.870 --> 02:06:39.880
<v Speaker 3>So then they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they figured out that nothing.</v>

2882
02:06:39.940 --> 02:06:44.940
<v Speaker 3>No wild animal basically likes tabasco.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they would douse dead animals with </v>

2883
02:06:46.381 --> 02:06:48.900
<v Speaker 3>tabasco and have a note.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2884
02:06:48.930 --> 02:06:50.670
<v Speaker 3>Tucked into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Never get eaten.</v>

2885
02:06:51.240 --> 02:06:53.250
<v Speaker 3>They would smell that and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck that.</v>

2886
02:06:53.460 --> 02:06:54.930
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd be like,</v>

2887
02:06:55.160 --> 02:06:56.070
<v Speaker 3>hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was pretty good.</v>

2888
02:06:56.100 --> 02:06:57.150
<v Speaker 3>This might be doable.</v>

2889
02:06:57.150 --> 02:06:59.220
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was in new orleans,</v>

2890
02:06:59.221 --> 02:07:03.940
<v Speaker 3>they have hot chicken,</v>

2935
02:08:38.160 --> 02:08:42.810
<v Speaker 4>this was a bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I should have just stuck to the one we </v>

2936
02:08:42.810 --> 02:08:46.591
<v Speaker 4>were in columbus once and we went to a </v>
<v Speaker 4>bar after we did the comedy show and </v>

2937
02:08:46.960 --> 02:08:51.960
<v Speaker 4>there was a guy in front of the bar that</v>
<v Speaker 4>was selling venison sausage sandwiches </v>

2938
02:08:52.150 --> 02:08:56.590

2940
02:09:01.591 --> 02:09:02.500
<v Speaker 4>eaten a venison sausage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this guy killed the deer himself.</v>
