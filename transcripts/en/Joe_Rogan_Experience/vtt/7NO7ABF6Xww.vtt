23
00:00:57.191 --> 00:00:57.881
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

24
00:00:57.881 --> 00:00:59.350
<v Speaker 1>emerging of the podcast,</v>

25
00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:00.940
<v Speaker 1>two huge influences.</v>

26
00:01:00.941 --> 00:01:02.740
<v Speaker 1>One you influenced me to,</v>

27
00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.230
<v Speaker 1>to have the fleshlight sponsor the podcast.</v>

28
00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:06.460
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're talking about.</v>

29
00:01:06.461 --> 00:01:07.090
<v Speaker 1>I was like fucking,</v>

30
00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.110
<v Speaker 1>I was going to jump in.</v>

31
00:01:08.111 --> 00:01:09.130
<v Speaker 1>Like I can vouch for it.</v>

32
00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:11.230
<v Speaker 1>I fucked many of those things.</v>

33
00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.660
<v Speaker 1>But we also made the fleshlight legit.</v>

34
00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.961
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

35
00:01:13.961 --> 00:01:17.410
<v Speaker 1>if I tried to do that before you were using them as a podcast sponsor,</v>

36
00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.951
<v Speaker 1>it'd be like,</v>

37
00:01:17.951 --> 00:01:21.910
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing connecting yourself with such a vile sex toy?</v>

38
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.170
<v Speaker 1>Somebody had to go first.</v>

39
00:01:23.171 --> 00:01:23.471
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

40
00:01:23.471 --> 00:01:24.370
<v Speaker 1>Kevin Smith has,</v>

41
00:01:24.371 --> 00:01:26.170
<v Speaker 1>his whole podcast is sponsored by it.</v>

42
00:01:26.171 --> 00:01:27.040
<v Speaker 1>He has these logos.</v>

43
00:01:27.041 --> 00:01:29.770
<v Speaker 1>He puts up this big flashlight banners and shit.</v>

44
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:30.070
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

45
00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.210
<v Speaker 1>my feeling was this,</v>

46
00:01:31.211 --> 00:01:31.600
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

47
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.190
<v Speaker 1>women have,</v>

48
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

49
00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

50
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:33.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

51
00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.660
<v Speaker 1>something to come with for years other than me other than you something else.</v>

52
00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.070
<v Speaker 1>And it's socially acceptable and they make fucking jokes about it on sitcoms and</v>

53
00:01:42.071 --> 00:01:42.790
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

54
00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:43.421
<v Speaker 1>We're just like,</v>

55
00:01:43.421 --> 00:01:44.320
<v Speaker 1>you could go now,</v>

56
00:01:44.321 --> 00:01:45.220
<v Speaker 1>my friend is here.</v>

57
00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.980
<v Speaker 1>So in a world war that's become socially acceptable,</v>

58
00:01:47.981 --> 00:01:48.521
<v Speaker 1>I felt like,</v>

59
00:01:48.521 --> 00:01:49.330
<v Speaker 1>why not?</v>

60
00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:50.410
<v Speaker 1>Why not vice versa?</v>

61
00:01:50.411 --> 00:01:51.790
<v Speaker 1>Why can't I have something to fuck?</v>

62
00:01:51.791 --> 00:01:54.160
<v Speaker 1>It's funny that we feel bad about feeling good.</v>

63
00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.850
<v Speaker 1>We feel bad about wanting something to feel shame they build.</v>

64
00:01:56.851 --> 00:01:57.271
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

65
00:01:57.271 --> 00:01:58.150
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
