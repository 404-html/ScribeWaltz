1
00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:01.321
<v Speaker 1>I try,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2
00:00:01.321 --> 00:00:03.270
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't take them unless I can actually</v>

3
00:00:03.271 --> 00:00:06.000
<v Speaker 1>sell it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but having to sell it more than once,</v>

4
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.660
<v Speaker 1>which doesn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which you have squarespace now.</v>

5
00:00:09.661 --> 00:00:10.830
<v Speaker 1>I think we're live right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're live.</v>

6
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.590
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like that one because it's real,</v>

7
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.450
<v Speaker 1>like there's no disputing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a really good product like.</v>

8
00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Charlie does my website and uses</v>

9
00:00:19.531 --> 00:00:23.130
<v Speaker 1>squarespace so he can actually tell the</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit that it does.</v>

10
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.260
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>red bands made like no bullshit,</v>

11
00:00:25.261 --> 00:00:30.261
<v Speaker 1>like a dozen or more websites during the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time in which it took to do a</v>

12
00:00:30.451 --> 00:00:33.060
<v Speaker 1>squarespace commercial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would just slap together a bunch of</v>

13
00:00:33.061 --> 00:00:35.880
<v Speaker 1>pictures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>call it red blood easy and put it up</v>

14
00:00:35.881 --> 00:00:38.460
<v Speaker 1>online in like 30 seconds and I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshitting.</v>

15
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.290
<v Speaker 1>It's that easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

16
00:00:40.291 --> 00:00:43.500
<v Speaker 1>we made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was the one that he made some gay</v>

17
00:00:43.501 --> 00:00:45.450
<v Speaker 1>one with Ari.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember?</v>

18
00:00:45.451 --> 00:00:48.450
<v Speaker 1>Jamie burt?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Squirts was one of them,</v>

19
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.790
<v Speaker 1>but there was something about Ari's legs</v>
<v Speaker 1>or something,</v>

20
00:00:50.791 --> 00:00:54.120
<v Speaker 1>something sexually feet on the table or</v>
<v Speaker 1>some shit like that.</v>

21
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:54.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

22
00:00:54.961 --> 00:00:55.910
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

23
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.740
<v Speaker 1>So it's probably not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't exist anymore.</v>

24
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.660
<v Speaker 1>Maybe some fan picked it up in Omaha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

25
00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.070
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a legit sponsor,</v>

26
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.330
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't argue with it.</v>

27
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.810
<v Speaker 1>Some of them to get sketchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a couple light turn down some</v>

28
00:01:12.091 --> 00:01:16.890
<v Speaker 1>luxurious sheets and I have no idea what</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

29
00:01:16.891 --> 00:01:20.610
<v Speaker 1>but I do buy nice sheets because I sleep</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot.</v>

30
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.890
<v Speaker 1>So they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to send you a free set of</v>

31
00:01:22.891 --> 00:01:27.891
<v Speaker 1>these luxurious sheets and these are</v>
<v Speaker 1>$300 sheets that are shittier than the</v>

32
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.950
<v Speaker 1>$59 ones I bought from some triple a</v>
<v Speaker 1>promotion on a email spam blast.</v>

33
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm not promoting that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Money's not that good.</v>

34
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.910
<v Speaker 1>But we had this one called lumosity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you heard of that one?</v>

35
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.420
<v Speaker 1>And it's like brain games and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually kind of cool.</v>

36
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.190
<v Speaker 1>They're fun to play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're stimulating,</v>

37
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.580
<v Speaker 1>but I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>games are good for you.</v>

38
00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.740
<v Speaker 1>Like if you play chess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chess is good for the brain.</v>

39
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:54.780
<v Speaker 1>It's good for the brand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Try to solve puzzles,</v>

40
00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:56.550
<v Speaker 1>try to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like an exercise.</v>

41
00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.630
<v Speaker 1>So that's undeniable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I guess someone had fucked up and</v>

42
00:02:00.631 --> 00:02:04.560
<v Speaker 1>like made some outlandish claims.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it helps early onset Alzheimer's</v>

43
00:02:04.561 --> 00:02:07.410
<v Speaker 1>disease and memory loss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of like,</v>

44
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who said what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what happened,</v>

45
00:02:09.571 --> 00:02:12.450
<v Speaker 1>but they lost millions of dollars in</v>
<v Speaker 1>court so they must have said some stupid</v>

46
00:02:12.451 --> 00:02:15.510
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were one of our sponsors and while</v>

47
00:02:15.511 --> 00:02:18.870
<v Speaker 1>we were doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people will like one of my sponsors and</v>

48
00:02:18.871 --> 00:02:22.440
<v Speaker 1>that really went sideways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got in late,</v>

49
00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.990
<v Speaker 1>you're late adapter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

50
00:02:24.991 --> 00:02:27.280
<v Speaker 1>There were just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a bad product.</v>

51
00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.310
<v Speaker 1>It's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're fun.</v>

52
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.200
<v Speaker 1>It's fun to play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're stimulating little games,</v>

53
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.630
<v Speaker 1>but I guess they don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make you smarter or fix your problem is</v>

54
00:02:36.631 --> 00:02:40.020
<v Speaker 1>I would promote shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not my sponsor just because I</v>

55
00:02:40.021 --> 00:02:44.400
<v Speaker 1>liked it because I had to go to break.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just make up a fucking neck stuff you</v>

56
00:02:44.401 --> 00:02:48.480
<v Speaker 1>like or stuff I didn't even.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would just pick random things out of.</v>

57
00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.940
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say a Bangor Maine,</v>

58
00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.310
<v Speaker 1>a wedding attire and this google</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's shop and then do a whole like</v>

59
00:02:56.431 --> 00:02:58.470
<v Speaker 1>really dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

60
00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.790
<v Speaker 1>you're getting married on Tuesday.</v>

61
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.070
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where is your wife going to get a</v>

62
00:03:03.071 --> 00:03:07.600
<v Speaker 2>wedding dress on short notice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just and do the actual company without</v>

63
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.920
<v Speaker 2>their knowledge or consent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And just do a really bad commercial just</v>

64
00:03:11.921 --> 00:03:13.720
<v Speaker 2>for fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good move.</v>

65
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.580
<v Speaker 2>That's a real good move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

66
00:03:15.581 --> 00:03:20.581
<v Speaker 2>But things that I actually liked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've bet on a bed online dot age.</v>

67
00:03:21.131 --> 00:03:23.530
<v Speaker 2>That's where I do my sports betting and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we.</v>

68
00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.870
<v Speaker 2>But I promote them all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how am I going to get a deal of</v>

69
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.990
<v Speaker 2>them promote free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

70
00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.020
<v Speaker 2>I keep telling you that what'll happen</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that's Brian Hennigan,</v>

71
00:03:32.021 --> 00:03:36.700
<v Speaker 2>my filthy uncut,</v>
<v Speaker 2>scotsmen manager sitting in who tells me</v>

72
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.360
<v Speaker 2>don't say anything for free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brian.</v>

73
00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.160
<v Speaker 2>That's a good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's always a good move.</v>

74
00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.050
<v Speaker 2>Don't say nothing for free,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

75
00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.470
<v Speaker 2>You're a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're off often on his podcast.</v>

76
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.480
<v Speaker 2>Very enjoyable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well listen you guys together.</v>

77
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:50.330
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>podcasts.</v>

78
00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.980
<v Speaker 2>Pretty bad ass.</v>

79
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.570
<v Speaker 2>I enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so loose.</v>

80
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.750
<v Speaker 2>So one of my favorite because it like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has no beginning.</v>

81
00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.720
<v Speaker 2>It's just the conversations in mid</v>
<v Speaker 2>stride.</v>

82
00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.160
<v Speaker 2>When is it on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's fucking on this.</v>

83
00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:02.330
<v Speaker 2>Things moving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

84
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:05.260
<v Speaker 2>It's my open mic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have comedy there.</v>

85
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.440
<v Speaker 2>So I do a podcast as open mic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just to keep in the mode of talking in</v>

86
00:04:11.471 --> 00:04:15.820
<v Speaker 2>an entertainment arena.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you cross training?</v>

87
00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.390
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically it is,</v>

88
00:04:19.391 --> 00:04:22.480
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it kind of in a way a defacto</v>

89
00:04:22.481 --> 00:04:26.590
<v Speaker 2>open mic where otherwise I'd just be</v>
<v Speaker 2>watching fucking Netflix all the time so</v>

90
00:04:26.591 --> 00:04:30.940
<v Speaker 2>I have to at least do something</v>
<v Speaker 2>artistically creatively.</v>

91
00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.700
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We haven't put out a podcast.</v>

92
00:04:33.701 --> 00:04:38.080
<v Speaker 2>We need to a week we try to hit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many people do we have?</v>

93
00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.180
<v Speaker 2>Just over 5,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you guys,</v>

94
00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:46.230
<v Speaker 2>do you think that it's possible that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>could sustain a small comedy club,</v>

95
00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.700
<v Speaker 2>a small local comedy club?</v>

96
00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.190
<v Speaker 2>Like we were kind of talking about this</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other night at the comedy store.</v>

97
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.350
<v Speaker 2>Like I think if you put together like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>small comedy clubs like you know,</v>

98
00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.740
<v Speaker 2>150 seats or so like you could fill that</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though it's a weird place,</v>

99
00:04:59.741 --> 00:05:02.710
<v Speaker 2>it's in the middle of nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could make it like a destination</v>

100
00:05:02.711 --> 00:05:04.090
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like guys like me would do it.</v>

101
00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.550
<v Speaker 2>I would do it for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Problem is the.</v>

102
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.420
<v Speaker 2>And I make jokes about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the main source of income and</v>

103
00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:15.460
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] his permanent disability or</v>
<v Speaker 2>handyman really.</v>

104
00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.040
<v Speaker 2>So no one charges when I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

105
00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:23.050
<v Speaker 2>I've filmed as my last special there and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that I was charging money at</v>

106
00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.830
<v Speaker 2>all was reprehensible to a lot of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the town really.</v>

107
00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.830
<v Speaker 2>Fortunately it sold out with out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>towners within under an hour.</v>

108
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.250
<v Speaker 2>Probably a better move that way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

109
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people in a small town,</v>

110
00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:38.680
<v Speaker 2>they like.</v>

111
00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm a rich guy there and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a destination at the weekend,</v>

112
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.740
<v Speaker 2>meaning it's the same as every comedy</v>
<v Speaker 2>club on the planet.</v>

113
00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.060
<v Speaker 2>It only makes money at the weekends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could.</v>

114
00:05:49.061 --> 00:05:51.280
<v Speaker 2>And it could do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could do that because you're only</v>

115
00:05:51.281 --> 00:05:53.500
<v Speaker 2>like how far from Tucson?</v>
<v Speaker 2>An hour and a half.</v>

116
00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.980

<v Speaker 2>That's fucking.</v>

138
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:08.290
<v Speaker 2>How ridiculous is that that all you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do to become a citizen is you got to</v>

139
00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:12.950
<v Speaker 2>get a person in that country to sign</v>

<v Speaker 2>This is real.</v>

143
00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:21.400
<v Speaker 2>The fact that they'll fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>investigate like I don't believe it.</v>

145
00:07:25.491 --> 00:07:26.790
<v Speaker 2>material.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were going to gain,</v>

<v Speaker 2>before it was officially canceled.</v>

148
00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:38.480
<v Speaker 2>I remember I was in the Atlanta</v>
<v Speaker 2>punchline parking lot drunk and I called</v>

149
00:07:38.481 --> 00:07:39.650

<v Speaker 2>canceled,</v>

151
00:07:41.601 --> 00:07:45.170
<v Speaker 2>but please.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just when Massachusetts legalized</v>

152
00:07:45.171 --> 00:07:47.230
<v Speaker 2>gay marriage was New Hampshire was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

<v Speaker 2>would be.</v>

156

<v Speaker 2>You want to go bowling?</v>

158
00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:06.101
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

159
00:08:06.101 --> 00:08:11.101
<v Speaker 2>we explain how awesome the gay lifestyle</v>
<v Speaker 2>really would be other than the gay</v>

160
00:08:11.181 --> 00:08:12.280
<v Speaker 2>parts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

161
00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:14.190
<v Speaker 2>Other than all the bud fucking Dick</v>
<v Speaker 2>Soccer</v>

162
00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:19.970
<v Speaker 2>seems like a great time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you do that before you get</v>

163
00:08:19.971 --> 00:08:22.370
<v Speaker 2>married?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just get it out of the way.</v>

164
00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:27.830
<v Speaker 2>Every fucking Sitcom with a married</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hetero couple is uh,</v>

165
00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:28.400
<v Speaker 2>uh.</v>

166
00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:29.990
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to fuck.</v>

167
00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.860
<v Speaker 2>Oh fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

168
00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:36.350
<v Speaker 2>what's fascinating to me is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>reinvigoration of manhood that I</v>

169
00:08:36.351 --> 00:08:38.630
<v Speaker 2>witnessed and men that are in their</v>
<v Speaker 2>forties,</v>

170
00:08:38.631 --> 00:08:43.631
<v Speaker 2>they get divorced like p segway talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>to live again,</v>

171
00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:49.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't you notice that the saddest part</v>

172
00:08:49.551 --> 00:08:54.551
<v Speaker 2>is it's men or women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I noticed the women who just,</v>

173
00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:59.880
<v Speaker 2>they kids when they were 18 and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>married some fucking dentist and now</v>

174
00:09:00.001 --> 00:09:04.320
<v Speaker 2>they're pushing 40 and the kids in</v>
<v Speaker 2>college and they get divorced and</v>

175
00:09:04.321 --> 00:09:08.190
<v Speaker 2>they're going to go out on the town and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to have fun tonight and they</v>

176
00:09:08.191 --> 00:09:12.270
<v Speaker 2>just stand out like they're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>dance when no one else is dancing on the</v>

177
00:09:12.271 --> 00:09:13.990
<v Speaker 2>dance floor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yeah,</v>

178
00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:15.970
<v Speaker 2>it's sad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's odd.</v>

179
00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:18.420
<v Speaker 2>We go right back to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

180
00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:22.740
<v Speaker 2>when they graduated college,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now they're 41.</v>

181
00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:25.890
<v Speaker 2>But isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fascinating because like as a human</v>

182
00:09:25.891 --> 00:09:26.341
<v Speaker 2>being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

183
00:09:26.341 --> 00:09:27.960
<v Speaker 2>you're supposed to be like living in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>moment.</v>

184
00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:30.840
<v Speaker 2>You're supposed to be enjoying the</v>
<v Speaker 2>moment like you are alive.</v>

185
00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:35.340
<v Speaker 2>Is it just the inevitable doom of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>clock ticking in the background that</v>

186
00:09:35.341 --> 00:09:38.370
<v Speaker 2>makes it so sad?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it is every morning?</v>

187
00:09:38.371 --> 00:09:42.930
<v Speaker 2>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do not wake up on a morning without</v>

188
00:09:42.931 --> 00:09:44.940
<v Speaker 2>thinking about how much time do I have</v>
<v Speaker 2>left,</v>

189
00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:48.600
<v Speaker 2>when will I die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stinks the great demise.</v>

190
00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:51.600
<v Speaker 2>But I've been doing that since my early</v>
<v Speaker 2>mid thirties.</v>

191
00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:52.660
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

192
00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:54.690
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you think about it,</v>

193
00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:59.720
<v Speaker 2>it becomes inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean everyone bashing your lifestyle</v>

194
00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:04.470
<v Speaker 2>because there wasn't an error.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Sam Kinison era,</v>

195
00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:09.030
<v Speaker 2>probably bad example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well he died in a drunk driving</v>

196
00:10:09.031 --> 00:10:10.270
<v Speaker 2>accident.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't even drunk.</v>

197
00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:11.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was sober.</v>

198
00:10:11.431 --> 00:10:15.480
<v Speaker 2>But where that was acceptable and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>it became unacceptable.</v>

199
00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:16.810
<v Speaker 2>So I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

200
00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:22.070
<v Speaker 2>I can name me and Ron White as the two</v>
<v Speaker 2>comics have any tenure that still</v>

201
00:10:23.701 --> 00:10:27.570
<v Speaker 2>actually drink heavily and smokes</v>
<v Speaker 2>cigarettes.</v>

202
00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:29.010
<v Speaker 2>He smoked cigars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

203
00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:31.670
<v Speaker 2>Dumb or rarely drinks pretty heavily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does he?</v>

204
00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's pretty open about it.</v>

205
00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:35.580
<v Speaker 2>He drinks pretty much every night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

206
00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:37.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

207
00:10:37.381 --> 00:10:39.900
<v Speaker 2>We heard he's not known for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he doesn't,</v>

208
00:10:39.901 --> 00:10:44.220
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't bring it up a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't walk out onstage at three</v>

209
00:10:44.221 --> 00:10:46.430
<v Speaker 2>drinks under his arm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Neil Hamburger.</v>

210
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.840
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But for real now he'll go up there with</v>

211
00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:52.080
<v Speaker 2>a drink or so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he's such a great guy.</v>

212
00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:56.380
<v Speaker 2>I just saw them last week or the salt of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Earth Chi,</v>

213
00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:59.790
<v Speaker 2>that expression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said no more true than that guy.</v>

214
00:10:59.791 --> 00:11:02.880
<v Speaker 2>He's just so sweet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's such a lovable guy.</v>

215
00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:03.750
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see him.</v>

216
00:11:03.751 --> 00:11:05.000
<v Speaker 2>I just can't wait to hug them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

217
00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:08.910
<v Speaker 2>we're on a cruise ship and I was just a</v>
<v Speaker 2>passenger.</v>

218
00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:13.110
<v Speaker 2>It was the impractical jokers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I fucking love their shows so</v>

219
00:11:13.111 --> 00:11:16.590
<v Speaker 2>much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They put on a fan crews and I've founded</v>

220
00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:19.740
<v Speaker 2>and I go bingo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I.</v>

221
00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:21.540
<v Speaker 2>Who is impractical jokers?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jokers.</v>

222
00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:22.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was two weeks ago.</v>

223
00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:25.350
<v Speaker 2>Who are they?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's untrue TV.</v>

224
00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:27.420
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the worst networks out there.</v>

225
00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:29.400
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's for guys.</v>

226
00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:34.170
<v Speaker 2>They're all friends and they do pranks</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you would do with your buddies.</v>

227
00:11:34.171 --> 00:11:37.100
<v Speaker 2>It's not like fucking Ashton Kutcher on</v>
<v Speaker 2>punked.</v>

228
00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:39.700
<v Speaker 2>They just dare each other to do shots</v>
<v Speaker 2>fired</v>

229
00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:43.450
<v Speaker 2>is when you explained it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't.</v>

230
00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:47.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm the first to say Ashton Kutcher,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy you haven't heard about an eight</v>

231

<v Speaker 1>You forget where you got them from and</v>

286
00:14:21.071 --> 00:14:22.780

<v Speaker 1>companies calling him up.</v>

296
00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:52.370
<v Speaker 1>Apparently he had used his money or uses</v>
<v Speaker 1>number other to uh,</v>

297
00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:56.420

<v Speaker 1>some pharmaceutical drugs.</v>

298
00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:58.510
<v Speaker 1>So they would just randomly call him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

299
00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:02.090
<v Speaker 1>they gave out his number so he would</v>
<v Speaker 1>just be fucking sit around and they</v>

300
00:15:02.091 --> 00:15:05.810
<v Speaker 1>would call him and ask him if he wants</v>
<v Speaker 1>to buy various drugs.</v>

301
00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:07.310

<v Speaker 1>well yeah,</v>

306
00:15:19.821 --> 00:15:22.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm definitely buying some stuff and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>put the phone down the street that's</v>

307
00:15:22.551 --> 00:15:26.900
<v Speaker 1>called a stroker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm from the old telemarketing days.</v>

308
00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:28.610
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a stroke or someone who would</v>

309
00:15:28.611 --> 00:15:32.690
<v Speaker 1>just purposely keep you on the phone and</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck with you for as long as they could,</v>

310
00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:37.190
<v Speaker 1>which is actually a good move while we</v>
<v Speaker 1>were fucking defrauding people.</v>

311
00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:39.560
<v Speaker 1>So you can't hold it against him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

312
00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:41.450
<v Speaker 1>it's fun if you get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a smart one.</v>

313
00:15:41.451 --> 00:15:43.490
<v Speaker 1>You got a smart one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got one that Didn't fall into the</v>

314
00:15:43.491 --> 00:15:46.370
<v Speaker 1>hive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate bounty hunters just because their</v>

315
00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:47.413
<v Speaker 1>cocks.</v>

316
00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:51.950
<v Speaker 1>I meAn you have a point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a stroke or as a point.</v>

317
00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:54.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stroke or as a point for sure.</v>

318
00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:58.250
<v Speaker 1>Random phone calls like especially the</v>
<v Speaker 1>unsolicited phone calls.</v>

319
00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:02.480
<v Speaker 1>Fuck them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all just get the fucking robots now</v>

320
00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:05.210
<v Speaker 1>and what I get now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if anyone else gets this.</v>

321
00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:10.630
<v Speaker 1>They mimic your own phone number,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it will have my same area,</v>

322
00:16:11.451 --> 00:16:15.380
<v Speaker 1>code and prefix,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then just screw up the last four</v>

323
00:16:15.381 --> 00:16:18.170
<v Speaker 1>numbers a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>

324
00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:22.910
<v Speaker 1>I Assume the psychology is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you recognize that phone number and then</v>

325
00:16:22.911 --> 00:16:24.320
<v Speaker 1>answer it and then you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh fuck,</v>

326
00:16:24.321 --> 00:16:27.350
<v Speaker 1>that's my phone number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now you're listening to a bot call.</v>

327
00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:31.940
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to extend your warranty?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a liMited time.</v>

328
00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:34.900
<v Speaker 1>How many people actually buy into those?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

329
00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:37.460
<v Speaker 1>it has to be worthwhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise they wouldn't just keep doing</v>

330
00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:38.303
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

331
00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:39.530
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a robot.</v>

332
00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:43.880
<v Speaker 1>it's a fucking computer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you could just hit a program and</v>

333
00:16:43.881 --> 00:16:47.510
<v Speaker 1>then go off to whatever you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>selling shoes.</v>

334
00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:50.180
<v Speaker 1>Some people are just really fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>lonely too.</v>

335
00:16:50.181 --> 00:16:52.190
<v Speaker 1>That's one thing to take into</v>
<v Speaker 1>consideration.</v>

336
00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:54.830
<v Speaker 1>My grandfather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before he died,</v>

337
00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:57.980
<v Speaker 1>my grandmother died and then my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was one of those classic stories</v>

338
00:16:57.981 --> 00:17:00.530
<v Speaker 1>where my grandmother dies and then my</v>
<v Speaker 1>grandfather dies a year later,</v>

339
00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:04.250
<v Speaker 1>just just didn't want to live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in that year that you didn't visit,</v>

340
00:17:04.251 --> 00:17:06.920
<v Speaker 1>he got lonely and I would take all</v>
<v Speaker 1>around here,</v>

<v Speaker 1>they would call him up and they would</v>
<v Speaker 1>like offer him like catalogs and stuff</v>

347
00:17:26.961 --> 00:17:27.760
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he would,</v>

348
00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who get the catalogs,</v>

349
00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:32.000
<v Speaker 1>he would order things from the catalogs</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it became like a problem.</v>

350
00:17:32.001 --> 00:17:35.480
<v Speaker 1>Like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just would get it just like his wife</v>

351
00:17:35.481 --> 00:17:37.910
<v Speaker 1>was gone and who know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his wife was there his whole life.</v>

352
00:17:37.911 --> 00:17:40.040
<v Speaker 1>So it's like you don't have anybody to</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk to.</v>

353
00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:45.340
<v Speaker 1>I think part of you just goes insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like part of you Blows a fuse,</v>

354
00:17:45.411 --> 00:17:49.440
<v Speaker 1>like the normal inputs just not there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like usually it's you and the wife</v>

355
00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:51.150
<v Speaker 3>and the husband,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you and the,</v>

356
00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:53.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then it's gone and they're like,</v>

357
00:17:53.221 --> 00:17:55.020
<v Speaker 3>where's that thing that's part of my</v>
<v Speaker 3>life?</v>

358
00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.450
<v Speaker 3>It's like a part of you dies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

359
00:17:57.451 --> 00:18:00.300
<v Speaker 3>And that they really do just want to die</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's how they go.</v>

360
00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:06.080
<v Speaker 2>How do you correlAte that to shopping?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is my beef with fucking hoarders is</v>

361
00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:09.840
<v Speaker 2>hoarders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll do a montage like intervention</v>

362
00:18:09.841 --> 00:18:11.880
<v Speaker 2>does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>

363
00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:16.230
<v Speaker 2>Then her husband left for another woman</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then she started</v>

364
00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:20.910
<v Speaker 2>stockIng the basement full of dollar</v>
<v Speaker 2>stores.</v>

365
00:18:20.911 --> 00:18:22.980
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that.</v>

366
00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:25.800
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the cause and effect.</v>

367
00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:28.890
<v Speaker 2>There's no scientific.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your psych intervention,</v>

368
00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:31.410
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell me one bad thing that ever happened</v>

369
00:18:31.411 --> 00:18:33.570
<v Speaker 2>to you and we'll do a montage about</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

370
00:18:33.571 --> 00:18:36.650
<v Speaker 2>And that's why you're a fucking crack</v>
<v Speaker 2>addict is though.</v>

371
00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:40.170
<v Speaker 2>No scientific proof.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why you're a crack addict.</v>

372
00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:44.100
<v Speaker 2>That they try to pin it on something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's plenty of people who had great</v>

373
00:18:44.101 --> 00:18:46.380
<v Speaker 2>childhoods that are fucking crack</v>
<v Speaker 2>addicts,</v>

374
00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:51.770
<v Speaker 2>but they need to have some reason this a</v>
<v Speaker 2>chicks would fucking self help books all</v>

375
00:18:52.201 --> 00:18:53.090
<v Speaker 2>over their shelf.</v>

376
00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:55.620
<v Speaker 3>Why thing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not an either or thing.</v>

377
00:18:55.621 --> 00:18:58.800
<v Speaker 3>I think that's part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a lot of people that have</v>

378
00:18:58.801 --> 00:19:01.440
<v Speaker 3>drug addictions because of abuse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

379
00:19:01.441 --> 00:19:03.240
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we all know them because a lot</v>

380
00:19:03.241 --> 00:19:06.510
<v Speaker 3>of people that get involved in drug</v>
<v Speaker 3>addiction because they were abused as a</v>

381
00:19:06.511 --> 00:19:11.511
<v Speaker 3>child and whatever fuse blew.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like constantly trying to put</v>

382
00:19:11.641 --> 00:19:12.690
<v Speaker 3>out that fire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

383
00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:15.930
<v Speaker 3>There's that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then there's also people that they</v>

384
00:19:15.931 --> 00:19:18.900
<v Speaker 3>just fucking can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just can't drink or they can't.</v>

385
00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:20.610
<v Speaker 3>They can't do drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just can't.</v>

386
00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:24.870
<v Speaker 3>They do it and then they get sharp eyes</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're fucking gone.</v>

387
00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:26.850
<v Speaker 3>They're just off to the races and we've</v>
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>

388
00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:27.750
<v Speaker 3>We've all met people.</v>

389
00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:31.910
<v Speaker 2>I know sean rouse is what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but i'M saying it.</v>

00:19:49.001 --> 00:19:51.280
<v Speaker 2>that wasn't the case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can understand why you would think</v>

396
00:19:51.281 --> 00:19:55.780
<v Speaker 2>that for your grandpa specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was.</v>

00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:08.260
<v Speaker 2>It was really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was good.</v>

462
00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:10.161
<v Speaker 2>She was good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

463
00:23:10.161 --> 00:23:13.600
<v Speaker 2>I saw her at her best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's when I knew your mats once she</v>

464
00:23:13.601 --> 00:23:16.120
<v Speaker 2>started drinking again was right after</v>
<v Speaker 2>the man show.</v>

465
00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:17.200
<v Speaker 2>Oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>

466
00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:20.710
<v Speaker 2>She had been like 22 years sober.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was sneaking it.</v>

467
00:23:20.711 --> 00:23:23.790
<v Speaker 2>She'd be drinking cough syrup because</v>
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>

468
00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:27.460
<v Speaker 2>she's a lifelong menthol smoker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so she always had a cough.</v>

469
00:23:27.461 --> 00:23:29.650
<v Speaker 2>So anytime you went to that filthy</v>
<v Speaker 2>apartment,</v>

470
00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:33.640
<v Speaker 2>she had a little shot glass of cough</v>
<v Speaker 2>syrup.</v>

471
00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:38.830
<v Speaker 2>So she was kinda like weaning or way</v>
<v Speaker 2>back into drinking,</v>

472
00:23:38.831 --> 00:23:43.690
<v Speaker 2>but using the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking dollar store robitussin.</v>

473
00:23:43.691 --> 00:23:46.370
<v Speaker 2>I remember talking about it on my first</v>
<v Speaker 2>cd,</v>

474
00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:51.410
<v Speaker 2>year 2001 probably when.</v>

475
00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:53.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think back then you could get the real</v>

476
00:23:53.641 --> 00:23:55.860
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a.</v>

477
00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:58.400
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't get real shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was a dollar store for you,</v>

478
00:23:58.770 --> 00:24:01.200
<v Speaker 3>nicole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like nicole would fuck you up.</v>

479
00:24:01.201 --> 00:24:04.590
<v Speaker 3>Back then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a comic that used to get one</v>

480
00:24:04.591 --> 00:24:08.670
<v Speaker 3>of the guys who worked at a rascals in</v>
<v Speaker 3>west orange.</v>

481
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.410
<v Speaker 3>There was a comic he used to get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the guys worked there to go buy</v>

482
00:24:13.411 --> 00:24:18.411
<v Speaker 3>him bottles of nyquil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would just drink bottles of fucking</v>

483
00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:19.830
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

484
00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:22.110
<v Speaker 2>when my brother was in the marine corps</v>
<v Speaker 2>in okinawa,</v>

485
00:24:22.111 --> 00:24:25.770
<v Speaker 2>there was a whole bunch of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They called themselves the robo raiders</v>

486
00:24:26.550 --> 00:24:29.010
<v Speaker 2>because they would drink robot testing</v>
<v Speaker 2>until they hallucinate.</v>

487
00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:37.600
<v Speaker 3>Fucking listen to this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

488
00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:42.110
<v Speaker 3>the regular nyquil I think had coding</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it didn't have jamie,</v>

489
00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:47.600
<v Speaker 3>you could get so fucked up like an</v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing way.</v>

490
00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:49.003
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

491
00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:54.220
<v Speaker 3>I got to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why I've had to morphine</v>

492
00:24:54.381 --> 00:24:56.960
<v Speaker 3>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of them was in the hospital after I</v>

493
00:24:56.961 --> 00:24:58.910
<v Speaker 3>had knee surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They gave me this thing that you could</v>

494
00:24:58.911 --> 00:25:01.580
<v Speaker 3>press and you can press it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every time you press it you get more and</v>

495
00:25:01.581 --> 00:25:02.780
<v Speaker 3>more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

496
00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:05.630
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well let's being high score.</v>

497
00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:07.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am in agony.</v>

498
00:25:07.371 --> 00:25:09.750
<v Speaker 3>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they drilled some shit into my knee,</v>

499
00:25:09.810 --> 00:25:14.390
<v Speaker 3>replaced a ligament and cut one and took</v>
<v Speaker 3>out bone and screwed it together.</v>

500
00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:16.420
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking agony.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm just like,</v>

501
00:25:16.421 --> 00:25:18.300
<v Speaker 3>oh pam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pam,</v>

502
00:25:18.301 --> 00:25:20.840
<v Speaker 3>pam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it just took me to this amazing</v>

503
00:25:20.841 --> 00:25:21.980
<v Speaker 3>place of bliss.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

504
00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:24.710
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no wonder why that shit's hard to get.</v>

505
00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:27.470
<v Speaker 3>No wonder why it's illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the next time I never would</v>

506
00:25:27.471 --> 00:25:32.471
<v Speaker 3>take medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I got a bad cold and I just needed</v>

507
00:25:32.481 --> 00:25:35.480
<v Speaker 3>to sleep and I couldn't sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I took some nyquil and it was</v>

508
00:25:35.481 --> 00:25:38.240
<v Speaker 3>amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was the same feeling that I had when</v>

509
00:25:38.241 --> 00:25:41.420
<v Speaker 3>I had surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the nyquil just took me to</v>

510
00:25:41.421 --> 00:25:46.421
<v Speaker 3>this butte,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fell back into the most amazing down</v>

511
00:25:46.910 --> 00:25:49.310
<v Speaker 3>pillow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just have love to</v>

512
00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:55.860
<v Speaker 2>people that are a beautiful jagged on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the vicodin percocet.</v>

513
00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:01.600
<v Speaker 2>So an opiate where I've taken vicodin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It did nothing.</v>

514
00:26:01.601 --> 00:26:06.601
<v Speaker 2>Even when I had one surgery in my adult</v>
<v Speaker 2>life was an umbilical hernia and they</v>

515
00:26:06.731 --> 00:26:10.270
<v Speaker 2>gave it to me as a painkiller and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't feel any pain,</v>

516
00:26:10.271 --> 00:26:12.640
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't feel any high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

517
00:26:12.641 --> 00:26:17.320
<v Speaker 2>maybe this just doesn't hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why buddy that got into vicodin</v>

518
00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:19.490
<v Speaker 3>for writing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would write on it.</v>

519
00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:23.120
<v Speaker 3>He would take vicodin and write music.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was his thing.</v>

520
00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:28.020
<v Speaker 3>He loved to crush up vicodins and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would take it and I don't know how he</v>

521
00:26:28.021 --> 00:26:29.760
<v Speaker 3>would do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>snort it or whether you would just</v>

522
00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:31.430
<v Speaker 3>swallow them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he would,</v>

523
00:26:31.431 --> 00:26:33.530
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would say that as music had become</v>

524
00:26:33.531 --> 00:26:34.364
<v Speaker 3>very creative native</v>

525
00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:39.360
<v Speaker 2>and it would do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't write on anything but a fear.</v>

526
00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:43.020
<v Speaker 2>Seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I write sober,</v>

527
00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:44.130
<v Speaker 2>afraid I'll</v>

528
00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:49.110
<v Speaker 4>write some shit down when I'm drunk</v>
<v Speaker 4>ideas and then sober me will have to go</v>

529
00:26:49.111 --> 00:26:50.470
<v Speaker 4>back and clean them up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

530
00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:55.410
<v Speaker 4>I got at best I can remember the premise</v>
<v Speaker 4>and now I have to make this good.</v>

531
00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:58.280
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

532
00:26:58.390 --> 00:27:01.830
<v Speaker 4>there's drugs that are good for stage</v>
<v Speaker 4>cocaine,</v>

533
00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:06.890
<v Speaker 4>which I'm not a regular user of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I've had shows where I'm just tired</v>

534
00:27:08.371 --> 00:27:11.520
<v Speaker 4>of saying this shit and do a bump before</v>
<v Speaker 4>stage.</v>

535
00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:15.510
<v Speaker 4>It's great for stage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but for writing nothing other than see</v>

536
00:27:15.610 --> 00:27:18.930
<v Speaker 4>fear and coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Joey diaz says that coke was terrible</v>

537
00:27:18.931 --> 00:27:20.040
<v Speaker 4>for him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for the stage.</v>

538
00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:22.380
<v Speaker 4>Joey said that coke would make them lock</v>
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>

539
00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:25.110
<v Speaker 4>It would make them feel evil and make</v>
<v Speaker 4>them feel greedy.</v>

540
00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:27.600
<v Speaker 4>He goes away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Would would take out the love.</v>

541
00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:32.520
<v Speaker 4>The amount of toke joey diaz was</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably doing is different than a small</v>

542
00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:37.940
<v Speaker 4>bic cap</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I would do like a 48 hour energy</v>

543
00:27:39.961 --> 00:27:40.794
<v Speaker 4>drink.</v>

544
00:27:41.370 --> 00:27:45.690
<v Speaker 4>Do you remember that time?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We did a musHrooms the day of the war.</v>

545
00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:48.720
<v Speaker 4>We took this as,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never had cocaine,</v>

546
00:27:48.721 --> 00:27:53.721
<v Speaker 4>but I did have this fucking coca leaves</v>
<v Speaker 4>tea from [inaudible] and he had this</v>

547
00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:58.980
<v Speaker 4>montay to cocoa tea was tea that was</v>
<v Speaker 4>made out of cocoa leaves and you would,</v>

548
00:27:59.881 --> 00:28:02.190
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you would drink it and I just couldn't</v>

549
00:28:02.191 --> 00:28:06.360
<v Speaker 4>shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>RememBer I was talking to you about,</v>

550
00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:09.360
<v Speaker 4>you and I were having this conversation</v>
<v Speaker 4>about it.</v>

551
00:28:09.361 --> 00:28:11.040
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is what coke is like,</v>

552
00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:13.080
<v Speaker 4>oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is awful.</v>

553
00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:16.180
<v Speaker 4>We've always said you're terrified of</v>
<v Speaker 4>trying because if I like,</v>

554
00:28:16.181 --> 00:28:17.880
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go fucking hay wire.</v>

555
00:28:17.881 --> 00:28:22.590
<v Speaker 4>And I think I'm terrified of it because</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I grew up I saw two people that it</v>

556
00:28:22.591 --> 00:28:24.960
<v Speaker 4>was pretty close to a completely ruined</v>
<v Speaker 4>their lives.</v>

557
00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:29.280
<v Speaker 4>One was a really good friend and anoTher</v>
<v Speaker 4>one was a really good friend's cousin</v>

558
00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:31.980
<v Speaker 4>and I watched their life just go to</v>
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>

559
00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:36.330
<v Speaker 4>I've seen the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw a couple of fat girls get thin.</v>

560
00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:41.140
<v Speaker 4>Do you remember when they had phen phen?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you remember?</v>

561
00:28:41.141 --> 00:28:42.800
<v Speaker 4>If I remember existing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is,</v>

562
00:28:42.810 --> 00:28:47.520
<v Speaker 4>I knew a girl diet pill.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His fucking truck stops speed basically,</v>

563
00:28:47.521 --> 00:28:50.190

<v Speaker 4>umbrella.</v>

564
00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:53.910
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was really fucking bad for you.</v>

565
00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:59.930
<v Speaker 4>I knew a girl who was god on it and she</v>
<v Speaker 4>went from being unfortunately like</v>

566
00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:03.150

567
00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:06.690
<v Speaker 4>ellen burstyn and requiem for a dream.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

568
00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:07.740
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a different girl.</v>

569
00:29:07.890 --> 00:29:10.110
<v Speaker 4>She was like a little plump.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Three people out there got that</v>

570

<v Speaker 4>Good.</v>

571
00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:13.980
<v Speaker 4>But that was a good movie though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Requiem for a dream was the shit.</v>

572
00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:19.660
<v Speaker 4>I almost forgotten about that movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said the fen phen lost a ton of</v>

<v Speaker 4>looked amazing,</v>

574
00:29:21.210 --> 00:29:23.460
<v Speaker 4>but then started feeling really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really bad.</v>

575

<v Speaker 1>fucking cold outside or how dare you.</v>

596
00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:34.450
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this girl was drunk.</v>

597
00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:37.960
<v Speaker 1>So you gotta think this girl has</v>
<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>

00:30:41.051 --> 00:30:42.970
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's fucking six below zero.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Have you seen doug?</v>

603
00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:50.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking you blacked out when</v>
<v Speaker 1>wandering off into the fucking arctic.</v>

604
00:30:50.170 --> 00:30:52.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go outside looking for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would immediately,</v>

605
00:30:52.810 --> 00:30:54.700
<v Speaker 1>if we were all hammered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I knew we were fucked up,</v>

606
00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:58.600
<v Speaker 1>so she's leaving a bar and she's fucked</v>
<v Speaker 1>up and her friends don't pay attention,</v>

607
00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:03.430
<v Speaker 1>just curls up on the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dies like there's more to her personal</v>

608
00:31:03.431 --> 00:31:06.550
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm using that as an extreme example</v>

609
00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:11.090
<v Speaker 1>of when you see chips waiting in line at</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bar like chill coot,</v>

610
00:31:11.091 --> 00:31:15.610
<v Speaker 1>charlie's in Alaska and there's a line</v>
<v Speaker 1>around the block at midnight in the</v>

611
00:31:15.611 --> 00:31:19.300
<v Speaker 1>winter and it's freezing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're all dressed up horsley and</v>

612
00:31:19.301 --> 00:31:24.301
<v Speaker 1>fish nets and whatever because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't say rather be in agony than look</v>

613
00:31:24.851 --> 00:31:25.684
<v Speaker 1>bad.</v>

614
00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:30.400
<v Speaker 1>There's so much power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a girl with a hot body and you</v>

615
00:31:30.401 --> 00:31:33.940
<v Speaker 1>have fish nets on and you walk into a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bar and you have like black leather</v>

616
00:31:33.941 --> 00:31:37.900
<v Speaker 1>shorts and fish nets and high heels and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a nice ass and great legs,</v>

617
00:31:38.170 --> 00:31:41.020
<v Speaker 1>you are a queen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

618
00:31:41.021 --> 00:31:42.580
<v Speaker 1>you are god,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know what?</v>

619
00:31:42.581 --> 00:31:45.850
<v Speaker 1>If you're a fat girl that can outlast</v>
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>

620
00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:48.430
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get the same fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>action.</v>

621
00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:52.690
<v Speaker 1>So the same doug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is the lady.</v>

622
00:31:52.691 --> 00:31:55.180
<v Speaker 1>It's the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the girl with the fucking,</v>

623
00:31:55.450 --> 00:31:58.450
<v Speaker 1>she gets all the attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She might get on instagram and get</v>

624
00:31:58.451 --> 00:32:01.670
<v Speaker 1>fucking millions of friends and</v>
<v Speaker 1>squarespace starts giving her money.</v>

625
00:32:01.671 --> 00:32:04.500
<v Speaker 1>Millions of real honest friends like</v>
<v Speaker 1>salted.</v>

626
00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:08.410
<v Speaker 1>The earth close to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but enough is it just fills the void.</v>

627
00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:12.640
<v Speaker 1>Like it doesn't have to be that void.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The kardashians made it</v>

628
00:32:15.150 --> 00:32:18.280
<v Speaker 1>started that fire and then she fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>vanished before the bomb went off.</v>

629
00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:20.680
<v Speaker 1>she got out and vanished.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She got out,</v>

630
00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:22.390
<v Speaker 1>she got the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

631
00:32:22.391 --> 00:32:23.480
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

632
00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:26.410
<v Speaker 1>just like old comics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't get out of the game.</v>

633
00:32:26.411 --> 00:32:27.930
<v Speaker 1>They got replaced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

634
00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:31.090
<v Speaker 1>but we got out of the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She didn't need the money.</v>

635
00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:33.010
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she develops a bunch of business</v>

636
00:32:33.070 --> 00:32:35.170
<v Speaker 1>ventures that are extremely successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

637
00:32:35.310 --> 00:32:38.860
<v Speaker 1>Like she makes a fucking ungodly amount</v>
<v Speaker 1>of money and decided to like lay.</v>

638
00:32:39.650 --> 00:32:40.100
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she</v>

639
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:45.100
<v Speaker 2>realized that the ego has a horriBle</v>
<v Speaker 2>byproduct.</v>

640
00:32:45.191 --> 00:32:48.710
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that fame comes at a price and the</v>

641
00:32:48.711 --> 00:32:53.711
<v Speaker 2>price became too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She didn't need to be seen with beaver</v>

642
00:32:54.201 --> 00:32:55.970
<v Speaker 2>hanging out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably Brittany Spears,</v>

643
00:32:55.971 --> 00:32:57.470
<v Speaker 2>but they're all the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll do that though,</v>

644
00:32:57.570 --> 00:32:59.060
<v Speaker 2>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a time where girls are just</v>

645
00:32:59.061 --> 00:33:04.061

<v Speaker 2>It was like right when social media</v>

00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:08.000
<v Speaker 2>first started popping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those girls were fucking gangster about</v>

647
00:33:08.001 --> 00:33:08.601
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just said,</v>

648
00:33:08.601 --> 00:33:11.360

<v Speaker 2>place where no fucking photographer</v>
<v Speaker 2>would ever be and I'm going to pretend</v>

<v Speaker 2>bentley.</v>

653
00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:26.960
<v Speaker 2>That shit doesn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not what happened.</v>

654
00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:30.570
<v Speaker 2>They have people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have security teams that rival the</v>

655
00:33:30.571 --> 00:33:34.400
<v Speaker 2>secret service to make sure that doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

656
00:33:34.910 --> 00:33:38.600
<v Speaker 2>yet it happened to you in the most</v>
<v Speaker 2>flattering way on the day.</v>

659
00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:47.270

<v Speaker 2>That's where porn.</v>

660
00:33:47.271 --> 00:33:52.240
<v Speaker 2>One more just one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If amy schumer shaved her posts,</v>

<v Speaker 2>stealing jokes thing because I don't</v>

<v Speaker 2>My three rolls of fat,</v>

667
00:34:14.811 --> 00:34:19.400

<v Speaker 2>hollywood won't touch a person like</v>

668
00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:23.770
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a fucking grotesquely hanging</v>

00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:38.920
<v Speaker 2>I had that picture dick him ball sack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have a huge dick to compensate</v>

673
00:34:39.231 --> 00:34:42.230
<v Speaker 2>for the ball sack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it kind of looks all proportionate.</v>

674
00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:46.940
<v Speaker 2>I have a small dick with hanging balls</v>
<v Speaker 2>are one hangs way lower than the other</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

677
00:34:54.801 --> 00:34:59.090
<v Speaker 2>The porn industry doesn't accept people</v>
<v Speaker 2>like me,</v>

678
00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:02.600
<v Speaker 2>but this is the reality of cock and</v>

<v Speaker 2>No one wants to fucking see it.</v>

680
00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:11.200
<v Speaker 2>It bothers me that people who you just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not hollywood that tells you what's</v>

684
00:35:21.651 --> 00:35:24.290
<v Speaker 2>couch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as laughing out loud.</v>

<v Speaker 2>She's funny on podcasts.</v>

686
00:35:27.070 --> 00:35:29.420
<v Speaker 2>She's really funny on radio shows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's very quick.</v>

687
00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:34.070
<v Speaker 2>I liked her a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not just people will go,</v>

<v Speaker 4>fuck.</v>

713
00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:03.660
<v Speaker 4>She's doing one of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

715
00:37:09.871 --> 00:37:14.871
<v Speaker 4>doing is what I hope you fell into that</v>
<v Speaker 4>I fell into when we were at that same</v>

716

<v Speaker 4>age where we both started getting</v>

<v Speaker 4>I think she's so big that she feels like</v>
<v Speaker 4>she is the voice for all females because</v>

720
00:37:33.571 --> 00:37:38.220
<v Speaker 4>they're telling her she is and she's</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably overcompensating on some level.</v>

721
00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:40.710
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's probably overwhelmed by the g</v>

<v Speaker 4>force of fame.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the g force of family she's</v>

<v Speaker 3>They just went under the real parking</v>

757
00:38:57.851 --> 00:39:00.100
<v Speaker 3>issue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they're moving to a new location,</v>

<v Speaker 3>save pieces of the stage and saved</v>

759
00:39:04.481 --> 00:39:09.481

00:39:15.131 --> 00:39:17.830
<v Speaker 3>it said so he doesn't get sued.</v>

770
00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:36.360

<v Speaker 3>I think this was,</v>

771
00:39:36.850 --> 00:39:40.150
<v Speaker 3>it was an old fucking club that the club</v>
<v Speaker 3>had been around forever,</v>

772
00:39:40.151 --> 00:39:43.990
<v Speaker 3>but everybody was saying that at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>time there was a million halfassed hicks</v>

773
00:39:44.410 --> 00:39:46.820
<v Speaker 3>and that's what you could call them</v>
<v Speaker 3>tours.</v>

774
00:39:46.990 --> 00:39:47.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

775
00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:49.930
<v Speaker 3>like right now there's like 100 of</v>
<v Speaker 3>towels.</v>

776
00:39:50.530 --> 00:39:54.580
<v Speaker 3>There's so many guys who talk like dave,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so many,</v>

777
00:39:54.610 --> 00:39:56.830
<v Speaker 3>there's so many fucking that tells,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

778
00:39:56.831 --> 00:39:58.990
<v Speaker 3>there's a bunch of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Patrice is when patrice was alive.</v>

779
00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:01.870
<v Speaker 3>There's a few.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Patrice has quite a few hedbergs oh yeah</v>

780
00:40:01.871 --> 00:40:04.360
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they've kind of branched out into</v>

781
00:40:04.361 --> 00:40:06.430
<v Speaker 3>the road,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what happens man.</v>

782
00:40:06.610 --> 00:40:10.990
<v Speaker 3>It's like in the beginning it's what's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's awkward is that we're watching</v>

783
00:40:10.991 --> 00:40:12.640
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we all kind of went through like I</v>

784
00:40:12.641 --> 00:40:17.290
<v Speaker 3>had a bad richard jeni period,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man where it was onstage and I realized</v>

785
00:40:17.291 --> 00:40:22.090
<v Speaker 3>I was like open mic level one year in</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was onstage and myself.</v>

786
00:40:22.091 --> 00:40:23.260
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my god,</v>

787
00:40:23.261 --> 00:40:26.140
<v Speaker 3>I'm definitely stealing the way richard</v>
<v Speaker 3>jenny talks.</v>

788
00:40:26.410 --> 00:40:29.260
<v Speaker 3>Like I was talking just like I'm the</v>
<v Speaker 3>same cadence.</v>

789
00:40:29.350 --> 00:40:32.080
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't even being myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I realized that like it's just</v>

790
00:40:32.081 --> 00:40:35.170
<v Speaker 3>because I admired them and I was scared.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was trying to figure out how to do it</v>

791
00:40:35.171 --> 00:40:38.500
<v Speaker 3>on my own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it becomes a lot of these guys.</v>

792
00:40:38.501 --> 00:40:41.440
<v Speaker 3>I think that's what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's guys that had been compared</v>

793
00:40:41.441 --> 00:40:43.870
<v Speaker 3>to hedberg then you can't really say</v>
<v Speaker 3>that anymore.</v>

794
00:40:43.871 --> 00:40:45.130
<v Speaker 3>Like you watch them now and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

795
00:40:45.131 --> 00:40:48.580
<v Speaker 3>he's found his own little weird thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but hannibal burress,</v>

796
00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:52.090
<v Speaker 3>when I first saw hannibal it fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>brilliant.</v>

797
00:40:53.110 --> 00:40:53.741
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

798
00:40:53.741 --> 00:40:55.480
<v Speaker 3>he sounds like hedberg it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I go,</v>

799
00:40:57.010 --> 00:41:01.300
<v Speaker 3>I think hedbergs stole sounding black</v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit,</v>

800
00:41:01.301 --> 00:41:02.940
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little bit.</v>

801
00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:06.190
<v Speaker 3>He had one of my all time favorite jokes</v>
<v Speaker 3>about bananas.</v>

802
00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:08.440
<v Speaker 3>Someone said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do want a frozen banana?</v>

803
00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:09.313
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

804
00:41:09.490 --> 00:41:12.640
<v Speaker 3>but I want a regular banana latest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yes,</v>

805

<v Speaker 3>favorite hedberg and it tells,</v>

00:41:18.250 --> 00:41:22.750
<v Speaker 3>and I don't have a girlfriend,</v>

807
00:41:22.751 --> 00:41:25.120
<v Speaker 3>upset if she heard me say that.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew that girl like that.</v>

809
00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:34.100
<v Speaker 3>So his jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of them</v>

810
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:39.100
<v Speaker 2>were reality based even though that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably why he hated the Steven Wright</v>

811
00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:43.430
<v Speaker 2>comparison where he was saying real</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

812
00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:48.080
<v Speaker 2>He really did give free bread to a duck</v>
<v Speaker 2>at subway like that.</v>

813
00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:52.160
<v Speaker 2>These things actually happened and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrote it in a way that was hilarious.</v>

814
00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:54.050
<v Speaker 2>You are with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

815
00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:55.940

818
00:42:06.021 --> 00:42:09.620
<v Speaker 2>and I was all excited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I played tennis with my friend doug,</v>

819
00:42:09.621 --> 00:42:12.760

824
00:42:28.281 --> 00:42:31.250
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just his own little weird category.</v>

1012
00:52:06.791 --> 00:52:10.210

1018
00:52:20.530 --> 00:52:23.170

<v Speaker 2>TwItter trains you to abbreviate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

1031
00:53:02.491 --> 00:53:03.280
<v Speaker 2>It's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1032
00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:04.890
<v Speaker 2>it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did one of their hours</v>

1033
00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:09.530
<v Speaker 3>or one of their videos online.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll just say that and it was all about</v>

1034
00:53:09.590 --> 00:53:13.910
<v Speaker 3>these mormons that live in Mexico still</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they have a fucking compound,</v>

1035
00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:17.960
<v Speaker 3>like an armed waco style compound and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's where he came from.</v>

1036
00:53:18.110 --> 00:53:21.350
<v Speaker 3>So essentially it's like that guy from</v>
<v Speaker 3>david koresh.</v>

1037
00:53:21.410 --> 00:53:23.360
<v Speaker 3>Imagine david koresh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his son.</v>

1038
00:53:23.660 --> 00:53:26.130
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Moves to Mexico</v>

1039
00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:29.430
<v Speaker 1>and runs for president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is what it's like.</v>

1040
00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:32.910
<v Speaker 1>It's like that similar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean oBviously like dude crush I guess</v>

1041
00:53:32.911 --> 00:53:34.860
<v Speaker 1>like shots and federal agents chill like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1042
00:53:34.861 --> 00:53:39.840
<v Speaker 1>So it gets a little trickier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's this branches out into a</v>

1043
00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:42.300
<v Speaker 1>Whole bunch of uva,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but these fucking people have.</v>

1044
00:53:42.330 --> 00:53:44.430
<v Speaker 1>They have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have guns and they have to fight</v>

1045
00:53:44.431 --> 00:53:48.360
<v Speaker 1>off the bad guys in Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they're stuck dOwn there like this</v>

1046
00:53:48.361 --> 00:53:52.140
<v Speaker 1>is where they've decided to like look</v>
<v Speaker 1>white people that look like they're from</v>

1047
00:53:52.141 --> 00:53:54.060
<v Speaker 1>fucking Utah and they were living in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexico.</v>

1048
00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:55.680
<v Speaker 1>It's weird as fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1049
00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:58.230
<v Speaker 1>It's really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's real weird.</v>

1050
00:53:58.231 --> 00:54:02.430
<v Speaker 1>But if we started a compounded because</v>
<v Speaker 1>our opinions are not popular,</v>

1051
00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:07.280
<v Speaker 1>fuck this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go to some other country or</v>

1052
00:54:07.300 --> 00:54:11.040
<v Speaker 1>place where no one fucks with us and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to have this death valley</v>

1053
00:54:11.060 --> 00:54:14.220
<v Speaker 1>party for life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why Not?</v>

1054
00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:15.360
<v Speaker 1>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why not?</v>

1055
00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:16.630
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm don't get me wrong.</v>

1056
00:54:16.710 --> 00:54:19.080
<v Speaker 1>Mitt romney for having a fucked up</v>
<v Speaker 1>parents.</v>

1057
00:54:19.081 --> 00:54:22.330
<v Speaker 1>He was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not down there fucking tweLve year</v>

1058
00:54:22.330 --> 00:54:23.760
<v Speaker 1>olds.</v>

1059
00:54:23.820 --> 00:54:25.530
<v Speaker 1>you will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't even belIeve brain.</v>

1060
00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:28.620
<v Speaker 1>David koresh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If david koresh gotten to situation,</v>

1061
00:54:28.770 --> 00:54:33.240
<v Speaker 1>we had a bunch of people and he made</v>
<v Speaker 1>them all have their wives sleep with</v>

1062
00:54:33.241 --> 00:54:37.500
<v Speaker 1>them like that's fucking his keys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stopped calling it a cult and start</v>

1063
00:54:37.501 --> 00:54:41.790
<v Speaker 1>calling it a fan base.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden you're living the free</v>

1064
00:54:41.791 --> 00:54:43.320
<v Speaker 1>market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>American dream.</v>

1065
00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:46.560
<v Speaker 1>The problem is you label it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all about tHe nomenclature.</v>

1066
00:54:47.420 --> 00:54:52.320
<v Speaker 1>you got to label it correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what the whole scientology thing</v>

1067
00:54:52.321 --> 00:54:53.940
<v Speaker 1>was about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The nomenclature of whether it's a</v>

1068
00:54:53.941 --> 00:54:54.890
<v Speaker 1>church or whether it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1069
00:54:55.020 --> 00:54:58.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That koresh guy was charismatic and he</v>

1070
00:54:58.261 --> 00:54:59.520
<v Speaker 1>had a lot of fans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1071
00:54:59.820 --> 00:55:01.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really what use them.</v>

1072
00:55:01.230 --> 00:55:04.620
<v Speaker 1>If they're having a good time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's to say his comedy stinks?</v>

1073
00:55:04.860 --> 00:55:06.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like these guys,</v>

1074
00:55:06.631 --> 00:55:09.960
<v Speaker 1>if they want to stay a deal's a deal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to let the cult leader fuck</v>

1075
00:55:09.961 --> 00:55:14.040
<v Speaker 1>your wife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just how it goes and it's not</v>

1076
00:55:14.041 --> 00:55:16.110
<v Speaker 1>like we can't do the same thing in</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy.</v>

1077
00:55:16.170 --> 00:55:17.160
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry buddy.</v>

1078
00:55:17.870 --> 00:55:22.530
<v Speaker 1>She cAme with me after the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus says it's okay,</v>

1079
00:55:22.531 --> 00:55:23.560
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do.</v>

1080
00:55:23.730 --> 00:55:27.090
<v Speaker 1>Did you really move with the comedian?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How terrible.</v>

1081
00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:28.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm leaving this colt.</v>

1082
00:55:31.050 --> 00:55:36.050
<v Speaker 1>It's funny that even in 2016 there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>ones that will buy into and ones who</v>

1083
00:55:36.541 --> 00:55:38.970
<v Speaker 1>were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was fucking stupid.</v>

1084
00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:41.100
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's like as a culture,</v>

1085
00:55:41.130 --> 00:55:43.320
<v Speaker 1>as a society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we get the main ones.</v>

1086
00:55:43.470 --> 00:55:47.730
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like political parties</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's just as ridiculous to have</v>

1087
00:55:47.731 --> 00:55:52.731
<v Speaker 1>the democrats or libertarians or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>green party or because it's ridiculous.</v>

1088
00:55:53.050 --> 00:55:55.740
<v Speaker 1>Just having leaders is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ridiculous.</v>

1089
00:55:55.741 --> 00:55:59.520
<v Speaker 1>All of it's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all in some ancient hominid</v>

1090
00:55:59.550 --> 00:56:01.640
<v Speaker 1>bullshit that we have stuck in our</v>
<v Speaker 1>genetics.</v>

1091
00:56:01.660 --> 00:56:06.660
<v Speaker 1>We think we have to have one leader that</v>
<v Speaker 1>stands over all of us and fucking</v>

1092
00:56:06.781 --> 00:56:09.180
<v Speaker 1>where's the special suit and puts his</v>
<v Speaker 1>hand up.</v>

1093
00:56:09.181 --> 00:56:10.770
<v Speaker 1>We all applaud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's retarded.</v>

1094
00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:12.270
<v Speaker 1>It's retarded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's ancient.</v>

1095
00:56:12.570 --> 00:56:14.910
<v Speaker 1>It's so archaic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just fucking stupid.</v>

1096
00:56:15.300 --> 00:56:16.110
<v Speaker 1>We've got to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1097
00:56:16.110 --> 00:56:19.000
<v Speaker 1>but if you're the first guy to not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're.</v>

1098
00:56:19.590 --> 00:56:21.180
<v Speaker 1>Then you're a dildo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1099
00:56:21.270 --> 00:56:23.320
<v Speaker 1>it's someone's going to have to figure</v>
<v Speaker 1>out how to break it.</v>

1100
00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:26.320
<v Speaker 1>Like they're going to have to like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It almost is going to take it and you</v>

1101
00:56:26.321 --> 00:56:28.120
<v Speaker 1>know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to take no one running for</v>

1102
00:56:28.121 --> 00:56:30.040
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The charIsmatic leader,</v>

1103
00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:34.870
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you'd have to get a charismatic</v>

1104
00:56:34.871 --> 00:56:36.380
<v Speaker 1>leader that definitely didn't want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>

1105
00:56:37.810 --> 00:56:39.250
<v Speaker 1>Listen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

1106
00:56:39.490 --> 00:56:42.970
<v Speaker 1>Everyone follow me and not following me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1107
00:56:42.971 --> 00:56:45.460
<v Speaker 1>That's the move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People don't want to fuck fend for</v>

1108
00:56:45.461 --> 00:56:49.270
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're gonna have to come up with</v>

1109
00:56:49.450 --> 00:56:52.750
<v Speaker 1>in like in our lifetime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are going to realize that there's</v>

1110
00:56:52.751 --> 00:56:57.250
<v Speaker 1>a lot of things that are just in place</v>
<v Speaker 1>that were we were born with and the</v>

1111
00:56:57.251 --> 00:56:59.890
<v Speaker 1>people that set them up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just did not have access to the</v>

1112
00:56:59.891 --> 00:57:02.710
<v Speaker 1>information that they needed to form</v>
<v Speaker 1>those decisions.</v>

1113
00:57:02.890 --> 00:57:06.070
<v Speaker 1>Like the reason why they started off the</v>
<v Speaker 1>electoral college.</v>

1114
00:57:06.071 --> 00:57:09.790
<v Speaker 1>All the bullshit that we have to contend</v>
<v Speaker 1>with today is because it made sense in</v>

1115
00:57:09.791 --> 00:57:11.080
<v Speaker 1>1776.</v>

1116
00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:13.480
<v Speaker 1>It made sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were just trying to piece together</v>

1117
00:57:13.481 --> 00:57:15.010
<v Speaker 1>this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to stick with that,</v>

1118
00:57:15.550 --> 00:57:17.440
<v Speaker 1>to stick with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time someone says,</v>

1119
00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:20.830
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the constitution it says,</v>

1120
00:57:21.010 --> 00:57:21.880
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

1121
00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:24.640
<v Speaker 1>if you can make a better constitution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make it.</v>

1122
00:57:24.641 --> 00:57:27.490
<v Speaker 1>If you can make that's going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>progress.</v>

1123
00:57:27.700 --> 00:57:31.060
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a bunch of things we</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to agree on if we want to call</v>

1124
00:57:31.061 --> 00:57:36.061
<v Speaker 1>ourselves America because otherwise we</v>
<v Speaker 1>become some like we've become like a</v>

1125
00:57:36.521 --> 00:57:40.510
<v Speaker 1>fuckin</v>
<v Speaker 1>become like the mantra with you and I</v>

1126
00:57:40.511 --> 00:57:45.040
<v Speaker 1>versus the mantra with adam and jimmy</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes up with the same name.</v>

1127
00:57:45.420 --> 00:57:47.170
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is this fucking thing?</v>

1128
00:57:47.171 --> 00:57:50.920
<v Speaker 1>This is not what I signed up for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody signed up for America and the</v>

1129
00:57:50.921 --> 00:57:53.140
<v Speaker 1>idea of America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's supposed to be freedom of speech.</v>

1130
00:57:53.260 --> 00:57:54.590
<v Speaker 1>That's a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1131
00:57:54.970 --> 00:57:58.750
<v Speaker 1>But how many people today are in trouble</v>
<v Speaker 1>for talking about?</v>

1132
00:57:58.750 --> 00:57:59.680
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1133
00:57:59.681 --> 00:58:04.590
<v Speaker 1>how many people today are in trouble for</v>
<v Speaker 1>revealing information or talking out</v>

1134
00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:09.600
<v Speaker 1>about things that they changed the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ellsberg verses snowden or chelsea</v>

1135
00:58:10.481 --> 00:58:11.770
<v Speaker 1>manning?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1136
00:58:11.830 --> 00:58:13.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ellsberg's a fucking hero.</v>

1137
00:58:13.661 --> 00:58:14.650
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You went with chelsea?</v>

1138
00:58:15.190 --> 00:58:17.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I did the correct gender.</v>

1139
00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:18.593
<v Speaker 1>I did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

1140
00:58:19.300 --> 00:58:24.300
<v Speaker 1>I had a lot of full of stimulants and</v>
<v Speaker 1>viagra and the fucking chick I thought</v>

1141
00:58:24.881 --> 00:58:27.360
<v Speaker 1>was a short thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>turned out to be a dude.</v>

1142
00:58:27.430 --> 00:58:27.851
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1158
00:59:11.321 --> 00:59:15.040
<v Speaker 1>if you didn't sign for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the credit card that's eating it,</v>

1159
00:59:15.041 --> 00:59:19.000
<v Speaker 1>not you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where I went to The Bahamas once and</v>

1160
00:59:19.001 --> 00:59:22.080
<v Speaker 1>came back and there was a charge for</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand</v>

1161
00:59:22.110 --> 00:59:25.970
<v Speaker 2>plus dollars for porcelain tile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1162
00:59:25.971 --> 00:59:30.470
<v Speaker 2>that's what I do when I'm on vacation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bought it porcelain kitchen tile.</v>

1163
00:59:31.100 --> 00:59:36.100
<v Speaker 2>$7,000 worth of credit card company eats</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wise.</v>

1164
00:59:36.120 --> 00:59:38.360
<v Speaker 2>That's what they have to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all those,</v>

1165
00:59:38.980 --> 00:59:41.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interested anyone steal your identity or</v>

1166
00:59:41.670 --> 00:59:44.120
<v Speaker 2>steal your credit card will protect you</v>
<v Speaker 2>against that.</v>

1167
00:59:44.390 --> 00:59:46.390
<v Speaker 2>Know the fucking vehcile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat it.</v>

1168
00:59:46.430 --> 00:59:50.200
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>leave that shit laying out and then I'll</v>

1169
00:59:50.210 --> 00:59:51.620
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't sign for it.</v>

1170
00:59:52.110 --> 00:59:56.180
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have this idea about information that</v>

1171
00:59:56.330 --> 00:59:59.090
<v Speaker 3>money essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't really mean anything anymore,</v>

1172
00:59:59.091 --> 01:00:00.560
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not backed by gold.</v>

1173
01:00:00.950 --> 01:00:03.170
<v Speaker 3>It's just all stored up on a computer</v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere.</v>

1174
01:00:03.171 --> 01:00:05.090
<v Speaker 3>We agree that $100,</v>
<v Speaker 3>$100,</v>

1175
01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:08.690
<v Speaker 3>but the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's the theory.</v>

1176
01:00:08.691 --> 01:00:10.310
<v Speaker 3>That's fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's data.</v>

1177
01:00:10.410 --> 01:00:13.100
<v Speaker 3>It's just just ones and zeros.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no physical thing.</v>

1178
01:00:13.430 --> 01:00:15.740
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing what's happening with</v>

1179
01:00:15.741 --> 01:00:20.090
<v Speaker 3>technology is technology is bringing</v>
<v Speaker 3>people and ideas like closer together</v>

1180
01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:22.280
<v Speaker 3>quicker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you have an idea,</v>

1181
01:00:22.281 --> 01:00:26.540
<v Speaker 3>you tweeted a fucking 100,000 people</v>
<v Speaker 3>might get ahold of that idea within a</v>

1182
01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:26.960
<v Speaker 3>couple of seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1183
01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:28.250
<v Speaker 3>Videos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you put up a video,</v>

1184
01:00:28.251 --> 01:00:29.390
<v Speaker 3>it gets crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it gets viral.</v>

1185
01:00:29.610 --> 01:00:34.020
<v Speaker 3>A million people and I see it in day or</v>
<v Speaker 3>two that the more technology improves,</v>

1186
01:00:34.021 --> 01:00:36.740
<v Speaker 3>the quicker and easier it is to get to</v>
<v Speaker 3>people quicker.</v>

1187
01:00:36.741 --> 01:00:38.510
<v Speaker 3>It easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is to communicate well.</v>

1188
01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:41.540
<v Speaker 3>Money is information and communication.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just about information.</v>

1189
01:00:41.780 --> 01:00:45.110
<v Speaker 3>We might come a time where the</v>
<v Speaker 3>bottleneck is money,</v>

1190
01:00:45.380 --> 01:00:50.380
<v Speaker 3>like we can't have possessions in order</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be this one in order to everyone</v>

1191
01:00:51.410 --> 01:00:56.410
<v Speaker 3>connects together and some sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>weIrd artificial evolution induced like</v>

1192
01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.700
<v Speaker 3>connection to technology that we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>inevitably going to have.</v>

1193
01:01:02.010 --> 01:01:02.780
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's common.</v>

1194
01:01:02.780 --> 01:01:05.450
<v Speaker 3>It's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The bottleneck might be money.</v>

1195
01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:09.770
<v Speaker 3>I think we're going to get to a point</v>
<v Speaker 3>where money's not real and instead of</v>

1196
01:01:09.771 --> 01:01:11.600
<v Speaker 3>drinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I had no idea what you said,</v>

1197
01:01:11.601 --> 01:01:12.770
<v Speaker 3>but I nodded a lot.</v>

1198
01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:18.320
<v Speaker 3>I think we're going to get to a point</v>
<v Speaker 3>where there's no more money.</v>

1199
01:01:19.010 --> 01:01:22.910
<v Speaker 3>I think that's what's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to get to some weird point.</v>

1200
01:01:23.470 --> 01:01:27.370
<v Speaker 2>We're gonna get to a lot of weird points</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we're not going to be here for and</v>

1201
01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:30.850
<v Speaker 2>the differences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have kids so you worry about it a</v>

1202
01:01:30.851 --> 01:01:33.210
<v Speaker 2>little bit more than I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably go.</v>

1203
01:01:33.220 --> 01:01:37.030
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I mean everything from 100 years</v>

1204
01:01:37.031 --> 01:01:42.031
<v Speaker 2>ago that you could not possibly imagine</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are happening now is happening now.</v>

1205
01:01:43.460 --> 01:01:45.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so a lot of weird shit we can't even</v>

1206
01:01:45.431 --> 01:01:48.310
<v Speaker 2>imagine will happen and I just won't be</v>
<v Speaker 2>here for it,</v>

1207
01:01:48.340 --> 01:01:50.500
<v Speaker 2>but isn't it really cool at the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>time?</v>

1208
01:01:51.130 --> 01:01:53.550
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like it's not negative.</v>

1209
01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:56.770
<v Speaker 2>It's like even the loss of moneY,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this idea,</v>

1210
01:01:57.010 --> 01:01:59.410
<v Speaker 2>like look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone's the negative people that are</v>

1211
01:01:59.411 --> 01:02:01.540
<v Speaker 2>the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>global warming and yes,</v>

1212
01:02:01.550 --> 01:02:05.050
<v Speaker 2>shit's going to go underwater and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>not going to be the Maldives anymore,</v>

1213
01:02:05.051 --> 01:02:08.590
<v Speaker 2>but it's going to be warmer in Wisconsin</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what?</v>

1214
01:02:08.591 --> 01:02:11.950

<v Speaker 2>many kids next to what coastline</v>

<v Speaker 3>What will we,</v>

1237
01:03:15.550 --> 01:03:19.730
<v Speaker 3>what were you just talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were just sayIng something that was</v>

1238
01:03:19.731 --> 01:03:21.650
<v Speaker 3>really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck did you just say?</v>

1239
01:03:21.651 --> 01:03:23.150
<v Speaker 3>Just before that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>

1240
01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:26.510
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>About worrying about the future more</v>

1241
01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:28.250
<v Speaker 3>because I have children.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's probably true,</v>

1242
01:03:28.820 --> 01:03:30.080
<v Speaker 3>but you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not just that.</v>

1243
01:03:30.290 --> 01:03:34.770
<v Speaker 3>It's not even necessarily worrying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's about like if I see a pattern and</v>

1244
01:03:34.771 --> 01:03:38.240
<v Speaker 3>then I see some things happening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I see a bunch of things that are</v>

1245
01:03:38.241 --> 01:03:41.330
<v Speaker 3>moving in a certain direction because</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like you,</v>

1246
01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:45.950
<v Speaker 3>I don't have a conventional job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not overwhelmed with having to do</v>

1247
01:03:45.951 --> 01:03:49.550
<v Speaker 3>shit that other people want me to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so most of my day spent thinking about</v>

1248
01:03:49.551 --> 01:03:53.000
<v Speaker 3>shit that I want to think about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so when I look at this whole weird</v>

1249
01:03:53.001 --> 01:03:54.350
<v Speaker 3>pattern like what are we doing?</v>

1250
01:03:54.620 --> 01:03:58.880
<v Speaker 3>Like what is this society doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Were some weird fucking builder creature</v>

1251
01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:02.210
<v Speaker 3>that's making better and better</v>
<v Speaker 3>technology every year because that's</v>

1252
01:04:02.211 --> 01:04:05.690
<v Speaker 3>ultimately what we're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but forget about all the shit about the</v>

1253
01:04:05.691 --> 01:04:09.860
<v Speaker 3>kardashians and all the shit about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>democrats and the liberals and</v>

1254
01:04:09.861 --> 01:04:13.580
<v Speaker 3>transgender rights and we're making</v>
<v Speaker 3>better and better technology.</v>

1255
01:04:13.581 --> 01:04:16.520
<v Speaker 3>All that other stuff just allows us to</v>
<v Speaker 3>have fun while we're doing it.</v>

1256
01:04:16.700 --> 01:04:21.700
<v Speaker 3>Just creates conflict and resolutions</v>
<v Speaker 3>and $50 hookers and all that shit just</v>

1257
01:04:22.610 --> 01:04:24.830
<v Speaker 3>rose up together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the.</v>

1258
01:04:24.831 --> 01:04:27.470
<v Speaker 3>At the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we're doing is making better and</v>

1259
01:04:27.471 --> 01:04:29.660
<v Speaker 3>better technology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all we're doing.</v>

1260
01:04:29.810 --> 01:04:32.360
<v Speaker 3>That's the one constant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we stay alive,</v>

1261
01:04:32.570 --> 01:04:34.310
<v Speaker 3>we innovate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we stay alive,</v>

1262
01:04:34.311 --> 01:04:34.950
<v Speaker 3>we keep going.</v>

1263
01:04:34.950 --> 01:04:39.950
<v Speaker 2>But if innovation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have to keep making more shit</v>

1264
01:04:39.991 --> 01:04:42.840
<v Speaker 2>just to make people buy more shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1265
01:04:42.930 --> 01:04:45.330
<v Speaker 2>isn't this shit we have enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1266
01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:46.290
<v Speaker 2>it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1267
01:04:46.380 --> 01:04:49.680
<v Speaker 2>It isn't us since we live a comfortable</v>
<v Speaker 2>lifestyle.</v>

1268
01:04:49.681 --> 01:04:52.860
<v Speaker 2>There was some story today where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1269
01:04:53.070 --> 01:04:57.900
<v Speaker 2>if the 62 richest americans gave way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most are their wealth,</v>

1270
01:04:58.260 --> 01:05:01.590
<v Speaker 2>everyone would live above the poverty</v>
<v Speaker 2>line and you go,</v>

1271
01:05:01.591 --> 01:05:03.870
<v Speaker 2>but then there would be a new poverty</v>
<v Speaker 2>line.</v>

1272
01:05:04.380 --> 01:05:08.670
<v Speaker 2>So then those people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At what point do you go,</v>

1273
01:05:08.671 --> 01:05:09.504
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1274
01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:12.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm rich enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got enough shit,</v>

1275
01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:16.260
<v Speaker 2>but I live above the poverty line</v>
<v Speaker 2>because zuckerberg gave me a bunch of</v>

1276
01:05:16.261 --> 01:05:18.010
<v Speaker 2>shit and now I</v>

1277
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:22.480
<v Speaker 1>live in a one bedroom instead of a tent</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a cardboard box.</v>

1278
01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:25.960
<v Speaker 1>Well then now you live in a one bedroom</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you see the guy in the two bedroom</v>

1279
01:05:25.961 --> 01:05:29.110
<v Speaker 1>and you go fucking dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1280
01:05:29.170 --> 01:05:32.080
<v Speaker 1>So what's going to happen on the poverty</v>
<v Speaker 1>line again?</v>

1281
01:05:32.190 --> 01:05:33.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to enjoy your studio</v>

<v Speaker 1>apartment.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Just like football as well,</v>

1285
01:05:41.231 --> 01:05:43.330
<v Speaker 1>there's a problem with getting shit for</v>
<v Speaker 1>free.</v>

1286
01:05:43.420 --> 01:05:45.100
<v Speaker 1>There's always a problem with getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>shipped for free.</v>

1287
01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:47.830
<v Speaker 1>That's not a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you porn.</v>

<v Speaker 1>cease and desist.</v>

<v Speaker 1>trey and ate them all at once.</v>

<v Speaker 1>movies and they put them up for free and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so like people shouldn't be supporting</v>

1299
01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:21.720
<v Speaker 1>those sites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's like a,</v>

1300
01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:25.360

<v Speaker 1>I would have him escorted out.</v>

1305
01:06:40.810 --> 01:06:43.690

1349
01:08:50.420 --> 01:08:53.120
<v Speaker 3>I want to do what I want to do when I</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to do it within reason,</v>

1350
01:08:53.390 --> 01:08:56.750
<v Speaker 3>within moral and ethical obligations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the law and all that kind of stuff,</v>

1351
01:08:56.751 --> 01:09:00.350
<v Speaker 3>but I don't want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I decide I want to go to bed at 5:00</v>

1352
01:09:00.351 --> 01:09:02.930
<v Speaker 3>in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to hear shit from anybody.</v>

1353
01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:06.380
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't wanna I don't want anybody</v>
<v Speaker 3>telling me you can't go to bed at 5:00</v>

1354
01:09:06.381 --> 01:09:07.970
<v Speaker 3>in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't sleep until two in the</v>

1355
01:09:07.971 --> 01:09:10.670
<v Speaker 3>afternoon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why not tell me why not?</v>

1356
01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:12.500
<v Speaker 3>Why can't I wake up at noon?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

1357
01:09:12.530 --> 01:09:14.360
<v Speaker 3>Who the fuck are you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a stupid.</v>

1358
01:09:14.450 --> 01:09:18.440
<v Speaker 3>So all my life I've wanted to get to a</v>
<v Speaker 3>place where I could go to bed when I</v>

1359
01:09:18.441 --> 01:09:21.770
<v Speaker 3>wanted to go to bed within reason and</v>
<v Speaker 3>wake up whenever I want to wake up.</v>

1360
01:09:21.860 --> 01:09:25.970
<v Speaker 3>So then if I decided to get up early,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like because I have to like see my kids</v>

1361
01:09:25.971 --> 01:09:29.480
<v Speaker 3>at school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I decide because I have a boss,</v>

1362
01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:31.400
<v Speaker 3>it's because I want to because I want to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get up,</v>

1363
01:09:31.401 --> 01:09:34.730
<v Speaker 3>I have an obligation to be with the kids</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I enjoy it and want to hang out with</v>

1364
01:09:34.731 --> 01:09:35.750
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1365
01:09:36.260 --> 01:09:38.420
<v Speaker 3>I think that if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you got to go in life,</v>

1366
01:09:38.450 --> 01:09:41.780
<v Speaker 3>the goal shouldn't be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>be as successful as you can be.</v>

1367
01:09:42.020 --> 01:09:45.980
<v Speaker 3>I think the goal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's not a money thing,</v>

1368
01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:51.220
<v Speaker 3>the goal is to make it as much like what</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit you would normally do.</v>

1369
01:09:52.130 --> 01:09:55.970
<v Speaker 3>Like give her a driven guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But my point is the opposite.</v>

1370
01:09:55.971 --> 01:10:00.971
<v Speaker 3>You're always driven to do something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the same shit every time I talked</v>

1371
01:10:01.851 --> 01:10:02.071
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

<v Speaker 3>why don't you just take a vacation and</v>

1373
01:10:04.971 --> 01:10:09.520
<v Speaker 3>just go fucking sit on a beach somewhere</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he's always not your,</v>

1374
01:10:09.521 --> 01:10:12.860
<v Speaker 3>your positive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Intel's always negative steak.</v>

1375
01:10:12.890 --> 01:10:13.970
<v Speaker 3>I lifted up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

1376
01:10:13.971 --> 01:10:15.350
<v Speaker 3>buy cds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No good.</v>

1377
01:10:15.370 --> 01:10:16.370
<v Speaker 3>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Steaks.</v>

1378
01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:18.590
<v Speaker 3>He makes me sad like that because he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>so brIlliant.</v>

1379
01:10:18.591 --> 01:10:19.870
<v Speaker 3>But it's such a nice kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

1380
01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:24.880
<v Speaker 3>I can't imagine either of you going to a</v>
<v Speaker 3>remote beach and relaxing.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Now I learned how to do that.</v>

<v Speaker 2>A burger king's next mcdonald's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would go with mcdonald's.</v>

1481
01:14:48.100 --> 01:14:50.980
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know why burger king was next to</v>

1482
01:14:50.981 --> 01:14:53.740
<v Speaker 2>payless shoes?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd go with shoes.</v>

1483
01:14:56.410 --> 01:14:59.060
<v Speaker 2>I said that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm surprised that every time I watch</v>

1484
01:14:59.061 --> 01:15:02.110
<v Speaker 2>him naked and afraid they don't stumble</v>
<v Speaker 2>into a burger.</v>

1485
01:15:02.111 --> 01:15:05.380
<v Speaker 2>King was no other option.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1486
01:15:05.940 --> 01:15:08.830
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking worst.</v>

1487
01:15:08.831 --> 01:15:11.170
<v Speaker 2>But I had to because there's nothing</v>
<v Speaker 2>else around.</v>

1488
01:15:11.530 --> 01:15:15.640
<v Speaker 2>Mcdonald's broughT the fucking breakfast</v>
<v Speaker 2>menu to all day,</v>

1489
01:15:15.641 --> 01:15:20.290
<v Speaker 2>but they didn't bring the mcgriddle</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't bring the greatest creation.</v>

1490
01:15:20.470 --> 01:15:23.170
<v Speaker 2>That pancake thing with sausage and</v>
<v Speaker 2>cheese.</v>

1491
01:15:23.390 --> 01:15:25.430
<v Speaker 2>It's the gray one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Creation they've ever made and what?</v>

1492
01:15:25.450 --> 01:15:28.030
<v Speaker 2>You can't have it all day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have a limited breakfast menu.</v>

1493
01:15:28.031 --> 01:15:33.031
<v Speaker 2>But today on newser,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mcdonald's soaring because they brought</v>

1494
01:15:34.060 --> 01:15:37.480
<v Speaker 2>breakfast all day and if you know my</v>
<v Speaker 2>body of work,</v>

1495
01:15:37.510 --> 01:15:42.510
<v Speaker 2>one of my biggest beefs ever is no</v>
<v Speaker 2>breakfast after 11 because as comics</v>

<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>

1498
01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:54.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to do the bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Point is that mcdonald's brought</v>

01:15:54.611 --> 01:15:55.660
<v Speaker 2>breakfast all day.</v>

1503
01:16:02.050 --> 01:16:04.300
<v Speaker 2>through the roof.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just can't take a risk because if,</v>

1504
01:16:04.301 --> 01:16:05.134
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't feel guilty about eating eggs</v>
<v Speaker 2>and english muffins.</v>

1517
01:16:46.751 --> 01:16:49.720
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty simple and straightforward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we'll put a process cheese,</v>

<v Speaker 1>fucking thing they did to your knee and</v>

<v Speaker 1>morphine and I can go straight to</v>

1533
01:17:36.140 --> 01:17:38.410
<v Speaker 1>morphe.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I got like three hernias work and I</v>

1538
01:17:48.801 --> 01:17:51.020
<v Speaker 1>don't lift anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you get them fixed,</v>

1539
01:17:51.021 --> 01:17:53.510
<v Speaker 1>it's so easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eddie bravo got to have them fixed at</v>

1540
01:17:53.511 --> 01:17:55.550
<v Speaker 1>the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just stick these.</v>

1541
01:17:55.810 --> 01:17:59.960
<v Speaker 1>They have this webbing they put</v>
<v Speaker 1>underneath the umbilical one fit because</v>

1542
01:17:59.961 --> 01:18:03.650
<v Speaker 1>you get it fixed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the other two I got the ventral.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Not a problem,</v>

1545
01:18:11.900 --> 01:18:13.790
<v Speaker 1>but the ventral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that regular?</v>

1546
01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:17.150
<v Speaker 1>The inguinal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the groin hernia.</v>

1547
01:18:17.900 --> 01:18:22.430

<v Speaker 1>One word is why I don't fix those</v>

<v Speaker 1>Catheter and catheter is not a part of</v>

1565
01:19:11.841 --> 01:19:13.580
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many surgeries have you had?</v>

1566
01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:16.160
<v Speaker 1>Not that many.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Honestly.</v>

1567
01:19:16.910 --> 01:19:18.630
<v Speaker 1>My nose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1568
01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:20.460
<v Speaker 1>both my knees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your nose?</v>

1569
01:19:20.470 --> 01:19:24.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a deviated septum and I also had a</v>

1570
01:19:24.651 --> 01:19:29.651
<v Speaker 1>bunch of blood that had pooled up inside</v>
<v Speaker 1>the walls of my nose and become</v>

1571
01:19:31.251 --> 01:19:33.920
<v Speaker 1>calcified,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a cauliflower ear,</v>

1572
01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:37.070
<v Speaker 1>like a wrestler's area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had that in there too.</v>

1573
01:19:37.310 --> 01:19:41.450
<v Speaker 1>They had a carve out some holes and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>had to do something called trim your</v>

1574
01:19:41.451 --> 01:19:44.120
<v Speaker 1>turbinates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your turbinates are like,</v>

1575
01:19:44.121 --> 01:19:46.720
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's like these bumps inside</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1576
01:19:46.721 --> 01:19:48.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the side of your nose and they clean</v>

1577
01:19:48.990 --> 01:19:52.190
<v Speaker 1>those and flatten them down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I broke my nose when I was five.</v>

1578
01:19:52.370 --> 01:19:55.250
<v Speaker 1>I fell down a flight of stairs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even before martial arts smashed my</v>

1579
01:19:55.251 --> 01:19:58.160
<v Speaker 1>nose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember crying and blood and snot and</v>

1580
01:19:58.161 --> 01:20:00.200
<v Speaker 1>my nose is always been crooked even</v>
<v Speaker 1>since then.</v>

1581
01:20:00.650 --> 01:20:02.820
<v Speaker 1>And then from that time on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

1582
01:20:02.900 --> 01:20:05.990
<v Speaker 1>Nobody ever says [inaudible] gorgeous</v>
<v Speaker 1>except for the nose,</v>

1583
01:20:07.290 --> 01:20:08.170
<v Speaker 1>but it's been broken</v>

1584
01:20:08.210 --> 01:20:10.440
<v Speaker 3>by four times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but nothing compared to some people I</v>

1585
01:20:10.441 --> 01:20:10.831
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1586
01:20:10.831 --> 01:20:13.560
<v Speaker 3>I know dudes who've had dozens of nose</v>
<v Speaker 3>breaks,</v>

1587
01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:18.090
<v Speaker 3>at least probably six or seven when I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you hear people bitching about</v>

1588
01:20:18.091 --> 01:20:23.091
<v Speaker 3>athletes making too much money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have a professional athlete.</v>

1589
01:20:23.131 --> 01:20:27.690
<v Speaker 3>Will have several surgeries in a season.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could be.</v>

1590
01:20:28.460 --> 01:20:31.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>if your dad's getting a hernia surgery,</v>

1591
01:20:31.261 --> 01:20:35.360
<v Speaker 3>you'll fly back from college because you</v>
<v Speaker 3>never know an anesthesia.</v>

1592
01:20:35.880 --> 01:20:38.220
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and these guys just have surgery.</v>

1593
01:20:38.490 --> 01:20:41.880
<v Speaker 3>That's the big argument for steroids</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the biggest argument for</v>

1594
01:20:41.881 --> 01:20:45.840
<v Speaker 3>steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>steroids rapidly improve your ability to</v>

1595
01:20:45.841 --> 01:20:49.410
<v Speaker 3>recover rapidly improved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if these guys get a surgery,</v>

1596
01:20:49.650 --> 01:20:51.870
<v Speaker 3>like a kelly's tenant or some shit like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1597
01:20:51.900 --> 01:20:56.640
<v Speaker 3>the difference between recovery when you</v>
<v Speaker 3>do steroids and recovery on the notch,</v>

1598
01:20:56.880 --> 01:21:00.660
<v Speaker 3>fucking cheyenne difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean absolutely gigantic difference.</v>

1599
01:21:01.110 --> 01:21:03.510
<v Speaker 3>They're not taking this stuff just for</v>
<v Speaker 3>performance.</v>

1600
01:21:03.750 --> 01:21:05.460
<v Speaker 3>They're also taking this stuff for</v>
<v Speaker 3>recovery.</v>

1601
01:21:05.460 --> 01:21:09.270
<v Speaker 3>It's in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean done correctly.</v>

1602
01:21:09.271 --> 01:21:11.490
<v Speaker 3>Like you should allow all athletes to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1603
01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:13.320
<v Speaker 3>Whether it's martial artists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's anybody.</v>

1604
01:21:13.470 --> 01:21:16.740
<v Speaker 3>The problem is like if you're talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about like a knee surgery,</v>

1605
01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.820
<v Speaker 3>the real problem is you can get gains</v>
<v Speaker 3>from that,</v>

1606
01:21:20.850 --> 01:21:23.490
<v Speaker 3>that you will be permanent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a certain percentage of those</v>

1607
01:21:23.491 --> 01:21:28.491
<v Speaker 3>gains gains meaning you gained speed</v>
<v Speaker 3>explosiveness just from taking these</v>

1608
01:21:28.591 --> 01:21:32.250
<v Speaker 3>steroids while your going through</v>
<v Speaker 3>rehabilitation because of surgery.</v>

1609
01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:34.760
<v Speaker 3>So it is tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is tricky because that,</v>

1610
01:21:34.770 --> 01:21:36.480
<v Speaker 3>that cheating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's playing football,</v>

1611
01:21:36.481 --> 01:21:38.460
<v Speaker 3>what have you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that cheating will be permanent.</v>

1612
01:21:38.670 --> 01:21:41.760
<v Speaker 3>Like you'll be a different person you</v>
<v Speaker 3>like literally will be more explosive.</v>

1613
01:21:41.970 --> 01:21:45.540
<v Speaker 3>Maybe even like only fractionally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like maybe a half of one percent or</v>

1614
01:21:45.720 --> 01:21:47.040
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's measurable.</v>

1615
01:21:47.250 --> 01:21:48.440
<v Speaker 3>You can measure the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1616
01:21:48.441 --> 01:21:51.660
<v Speaker 3>the tissues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can measure the amount of gains you</v>

1617
01:21:51.661 --> 01:21:53.790
<v Speaker 3>keep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's been some studies on it.</v>

1618
01:21:53.790 --> 01:21:54.420
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1619
01:21:54.420 --> 01:21:58.890
<v Speaker 3>it's tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much do you need as we near 50 years</v>

1620
01:21:58.891 --> 01:22:01.230
<v Speaker 3>old?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a hobby of mine.</v>

1621
01:22:01.410 --> 01:22:03.360
<v Speaker 3>I enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the problem.</v>

1622
01:22:03.420 --> 01:22:07.650
<v Speaker 3>I enjoy training like it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it helps me for me personally,</v>

1623
01:22:07.651 --> 01:22:10.260
<v Speaker 3>like we talked about like I do too many</v>
<v Speaker 3>things or I do a lot of different</v>

1624
01:22:10.261 --> 01:22:12.060
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that it seems like a</v>

1625
01:22:12.061 --> 01:22:17.061
<v Speaker 3>half to do in order to stay even is that</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to do a lot of physical activity.</v>

1626
01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:19.980
<v Speaker 3>If I don't do a lot of physical</v>
<v Speaker 3>activity,</v>

1627
01:22:19.981 --> 01:22:23.820
<v Speaker 3>whether it's like anything go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go hiking,</v>

1628
01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:25.620
<v Speaker 3>I could workout,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could do something,</v>

1629
01:22:25.621 --> 01:22:28.830
<v Speaker 3>but if I don't push my body and drained</v>
<v Speaker 3>some energy out,</v>

1630
01:22:29.460 --> 01:22:32.340
<v Speaker 3>then I don't feel my best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't feel,</v>

1631
01:22:32.350 --> 01:22:33.540
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1632
01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:35.670
<v Speaker 3>uneven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't feel relaxed enough.</v>

1633
01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:39.660
<v Speaker 3>Like I have to drain the battery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for me like to keep my sanity and</v>

1634
01:22:39.661 --> 01:22:42.420
<v Speaker 3>perspective and clarity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to drain the battery.</v>

1635
01:22:43.190 --> 01:22:46.140
<v Speaker 3>That's why I do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The best way to do that.</v>

1636
01:22:47.790 --> 01:22:49.560
<v Speaker 3>I thought you were gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say cocktails.</v>

1637
01:22:52.030 --> 01:22:56.430
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's got their own way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A problem is my way.</v>

1638
01:22:56.431 --> 01:22:59.010
<v Speaker 3>It's prejudiced against.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are prejudiced against my way.</v>

1639
01:22:59.610 --> 01:23:04.520
<v Speaker 3>My way is the way of the meathead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can always find someone who's,</v>

1640
01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:06.070
<v Speaker 3>oh fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He brought whiskey.</v>

1641
01:23:06.580 --> 01:23:08.590
<v Speaker 1>I thought I should just bring whiskey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

1642
01:23:09.330 --> 01:23:13.390
<v Speaker 1>Got a lot of Jack Daniels in bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I been drinking jack and coke,</v>

1643
01:23:13.391 --> 01:23:18.391
<v Speaker 1>but what I don't like is the koch koch</v>
<v Speaker 1>or red bull or anything like that feels</v>

1644
01:23:19.211 --> 01:23:22.870
<v Speaker 1>worse than like if you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather do methamphetamine,</v>

1645
01:23:22.900 --> 01:23:27.410
<v Speaker 1>which is the worst drug ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked myself into putting the coconut</v>

1646
01:23:27.430 --> 01:23:30.310
<v Speaker 1>so I don't feel like a deviant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just drink it straight.</v>

1647
01:23:30.311 --> 01:23:32.980
<v Speaker 1>Jack daniels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems like something someone is a</v>

1648
01:23:33.250 --> 01:23:35.920
<v Speaker 1>reckless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not if you drink it on the rocks and a</v>

1649
01:23:35.921 --> 01:23:39.560
<v Speaker 1>proper rocks glass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The nectar of the gods and they be</v>

1650
01:23:40.090 --> 01:23:44.700
<v Speaker 1>tinkle the glass and the new snippet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that one an entre cold?</v>

1651
01:23:44.701 --> 01:23:46.960
<v Speaker 1>It isn't that like part of a Jack</v>
<v Speaker 1>Daniels commercial.</v>

1652
01:23:46.990 --> 01:23:51.990
<v Speaker 1>The nectar of the gods baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a you're thinking of and one of</v>

1653
01:23:52.571 --> 01:23:57.130
<v Speaker 1>the last to go know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a commercial for jack.</v>

1654
01:23:57.130 --> 01:23:58.540
<v Speaker 1>Daniel was there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1655
01:23:58.790 --> 01:24:00.340
<v Speaker 1>pretty sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a commercial for Jack Daniels</v>

1656
01:24:00.341 --> 01:24:05.341
<v Speaker 1>that featured sinatra talking about Jack</v>
<v Speaker 1>Daniels calling it the nectar of the</v>

1657
01:24:05.471 --> 01:24:08.290
<v Speaker 1>gods was during one of his shows in</v>
<v Speaker 1>vegas.</v>

1658
01:24:08.770 --> 01:24:10.030
<v Speaker 1>The satins or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1659
01:24:10.031 --> 01:24:10.631
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1660
01:24:10.631 --> 01:24:14.790
<v Speaker 1>they had that rat pack era,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the most amazing times.</v>

1661
01:24:14.830 --> 01:24:16.010
<v Speaker 1>let's say here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll listen to it.</v>

1662
01:24:16.020 --> 01:24:17.290
<v Speaker 1>Put your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Put your headphones on real quick,</v>

1663

<v Speaker 1>is this the one where he does it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>His jet carried it to foreign lands.</v>

1665
01:24:26.830 --> 01:24:29.380
<v Speaker 1>I can't get this whole fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>commercial codes in the end.</v>

1666
01:24:35.140 --> 01:24:38.110
<v Speaker 1>You gotta you gotta fucking try these in</v>
<v Speaker 1>advance on how.</v>

1667
01:24:38.170 --> 01:24:40.870
<v Speaker 1>Either way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The point is no one was tweeting.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Sinatra going don't die on us,</v>

1670
01:24:46.151 --> 01:24:46.871
<v Speaker 1>going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

1671
01:24:46.871 --> 01:24:48.340
<v Speaker 1>they thought cigarettes were made you</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy,</v>

1672
01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:49.301
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's back.</v>

1673
01:24:49.301 --> 01:24:51.000
<v Speaker 1>When did you see the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1674
01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:53.060
<v Speaker 1>you've seen the leonardo dicaprio movie</v>
<v Speaker 1>on</v>

1675
01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:55.930
<v Speaker 1>wall street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the one,</v>

1676
01:24:57.130 --> 01:24:59.170
<v Speaker 1>the one where he played,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1677
01:24:59.640 --> 01:25:00.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fbi guy,</v>

1678
01:25:00.941 --> 01:25:03.010
<v Speaker 1>j edgar hooverj,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dot edgar hoover,</v>

1679
01:25:03.190 --> 01:25:06.400
<v Speaker 1>the j edgar hooverj,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dot edgar hoover's mom was like talking</v>

1680
01:25:06.401 --> 01:25:10.660
<v Speaker 1>about him being sickly and how the</v>
<v Speaker 1>doctor had prescribed him cigarettes and</v>

1681
01:25:10.661 --> 01:25:13.060
<v Speaker 1>she'd be smoking cigarettes to become</v>
<v Speaker 1>more robust.</v>

1682
01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:16.210
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1683
01:25:16.211 --> 01:25:19.850
<v Speaker 1>Always wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't back then they were fucking wrong.</v>

1684
01:25:21.100 --> 01:25:24.410
<v Speaker 1>J edgar hoover sadly died when he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>with 35.</v>

1685
01:25:24.690 --> 01:25:27.140
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he lived a full fucking life to</v>

1686
01:25:28.090 --> 01:25:29.680
<v Speaker 1>fortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but still.</v>

1687
01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:34.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you keep tweeting me don't die</v>

1688
01:25:34.631 --> 01:25:39.010
<v Speaker 1>on us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know a live a unhealthy lifestyle as</v>

1689
01:25:39.011 --> 01:25:41.770
<v Speaker 1>far as we know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm enjoying it.</v>

1690
01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:47.520
<v Speaker 1>So until you're a fucking doctor who was</v>
<v Speaker 1>prescient better than the doctors who</v>

1691
01:25:47.561 --> 01:25:51.040
<v Speaker 1>said j dot edgar hoover's mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she'd be more robust.</v>

1692
01:25:51.330 --> 01:25:53.160
<v Speaker 1>Smoking cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1693
01:25:53.170 --> 01:25:57.040
<v Speaker 1>you're a study in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I was a scientist or a doctor who's</v>

1694
01:25:57.041 --> 01:26:00.110
<v Speaker 1>trying to study people that are healthy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and happy and why I'm.</v>

1695
01:26:00.130 --> 01:26:01.900
<v Speaker 1>I would study you because I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1696
01:26:01.901 --> 01:26:04.940
<v Speaker 1>here's this guy that's doing whatever</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fuck he wants to do.</v>

1697
01:26:04.941 --> 01:26:06.110
<v Speaker 1>Smoking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was drinking,</v>

1698
01:26:06.140 --> 01:26:10.610
<v Speaker 1>but he appears relatively healthy in</v>
<v Speaker 1>comparison to a lot of other people that</v>

1699
01:26:10.611 --> 01:26:13.490
<v Speaker 1>are not doing those things but are</v>
<v Speaker 1>working full time,</v>

1700
01:26:14.350 --> 01:26:16.580
<v Speaker 1>solace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thankless jobs,</v>

1701
01:26:16.790 --> 01:26:20.900
<v Speaker 1>and they're the same age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if I followed your happiness meter,</v>

1702
01:26:21.020 --> 01:26:24.410
<v Speaker 1>like if there's a score card and it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a fucking college basketball game</v>

1703
01:26:24.411 --> 01:26:29.411
<v Speaker 1>and I could look at the happiness meter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be a dominating victory in the</v>

1704
01:26:29.910 --> 01:26:34.910
<v Speaker 1>nine to five offer over the normal 47</v>
<v Speaker 1>year old doesn't have its downfalls.</v>

1705
01:26:35.570 --> 01:26:39.590
<v Speaker 1>I wake up in sheer terror and I wake up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even when I'm home,</v>

1706
01:26:39.591 --> 01:26:41.660
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gotta get the fuck outta here and I go</v>

1707
01:26:41.661 --> 01:26:46.390
<v Speaker 1>right to delta.com and see what the next</v>
<v Speaker 1>flight and then I chill out and then I</v>

1708
01:26:47.300 --> 01:26:48.680
<v Speaker 1>eased back in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

1709
01:26:48.710 --> 01:26:50.870
<v Speaker 1>there's downtimes to this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying,</v>

1710
01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:52.310
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy all the time.</v>

1711
01:26:52.311 --> 01:26:57.140
<v Speaker 1>Being a drunk and a chain smoker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but well we all are freaking.</v>

1712
01:26:57.141 --> 01:27:00.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean This is a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is like a core tenant of being a</v>

1713
01:27:00.321 --> 01:27:02.720
<v Speaker 1>human being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're paying attention,</v>

1714
01:27:03.170 --> 01:27:06.350
<v Speaker 1>you're freaking out about your</v>
<v Speaker 1>expiration date.</v>

1715
01:27:06.740 --> 01:27:11.600
<v Speaker 1>You're freaking out about the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a finite experience.</v>

1716
01:27:11.601 --> 01:27:15.110
<v Speaker 1>It's going to end and we don't know when</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we don't know why and we're getting</v>

1717
01:27:15.111 --> 01:27:17.090
<v Speaker 1>closer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're getting closer every day,</v>

1718
01:27:17.091 --> 01:27:20.120
<v Speaker 1>but you know what could have happened</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you were to have to a lot of people</v>

1719
01:27:20.121 --> 01:27:20.954
<v Speaker 1>at two.</v>

1720
01:27:21.060 --> 01:27:22.970
<v Speaker 1>Could it happened in a car accident when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were five?</v>

1721
01:27:23.540 --> 01:27:25.010
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people in car accidents when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

1722
01:27:25.130 --> 01:27:30.130
<v Speaker 1>but guys like you that make me feel like</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit about just sitting and watching</v>

1723
01:27:30.681 --> 01:27:35.681
<v Speaker 1>netflix for four straight days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not getting up other than to piss or get</v>

1724
01:27:37.551 --> 01:27:39.620
<v Speaker 1>a snack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you enjoy that time.</v>

1725
01:27:39.621 --> 01:27:41.660
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish I Could just go,</v>

1726
01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:42.860
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just me.</v>

1727
01:27:42.890 --> 01:27:46.490
<v Speaker 1>Why can't I enjoy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do I have to always think I see</v>

1728
01:27:46.491 --> 01:27:50.000
<v Speaker 1>someone who can dance and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll never be able to dance.</v>

1729
01:27:50.001 --> 01:27:55.001
<v Speaker 1>Why don'T why I don't excel at any of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rather than focusing on what I do,</v>

1730
01:27:55.311 --> 01:27:59.540
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I too much focus on what other people do</v>

1731
01:27:59.541 --> 01:28:03.350
<v Speaker 1>that I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where obsessive struggle comes</v>

1732
01:28:03.351 --> 01:28:04.420
<v Speaker 1>into play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doug.</v>

1733
01:28:04.421 --> 01:28:06.040
<v Speaker 1>Stan hope because it was tests have</v>
<v Speaker 1>struggle with.</v>

1734
01:28:06.060 --> 01:28:09.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm really into when I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what you call fucking groping</v>

1735
01:28:09.231 --> 01:28:09.770
<v Speaker 1>men?</v>

1736
01:28:09.770 --> 01:28:10.470
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1737
01:28:10.470 --> 01:28:13.950
<v Speaker 1>That's my obsessive struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It.</v>

1738
01:28:13.990 --> 01:28:16.130
<v Speaker 1>It'll fall in everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything.</v>

1739
01:28:16.131 --> 01:28:19.700
<v Speaker 1>I do groping men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shoot 100 hours a day.</v>

1740
01:28:20.350 --> 01:28:22.490
<v Speaker 1>Archery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I just shoot at targets because I</v>

1741
01:28:22.491 --> 01:28:23.660
<v Speaker 1>love practicing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fun.</v>

1742
01:28:23.700 --> 01:28:25.820
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a great example.</v>

1743
01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:29.930
<v Speaker 1>If I shot 100 arrows a day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would be thinking,</v>

1744
01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:34.370
<v Speaker 1>why am I not doing more with my life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like no matter what you do,</v>

1745
01:28:34.371 --> 01:28:39.371
<v Speaker 1>I think I should be doing something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other people that I respect are doing</v>

1746
01:28:39.810 --> 01:28:41.210
<v Speaker 1>what you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you do,</v>

1747
01:28:41.211 --> 01:28:43.850
<v Speaker 1>and I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't get comfortable with just doing</v>

1748
01:28:43.851 --> 01:28:45.890
<v Speaker 1>what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No matter what it is.</v>

1749
01:28:46.250 --> 01:28:50.420
<v Speaker 1>I see someone else who does something I</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't do and go work kid.</v>

1750
01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:51.890
<v Speaker 1>Maybe this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe this will help.</v>

1751
01:28:51.920 --> 01:28:54.050
<v Speaker 1>ThiS is an insight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's one thing that's true.</v>

1752
01:28:54.260 --> 01:28:57.470
<v Speaker 1>If I have things to do and I don't do</v>
<v Speaker 1>them and I go shoot those arrows,</v>

1753
01:28:57.590 --> 01:29:00.710
<v Speaker 1>then I feel like a fucking loser.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one weird thing.</v>

1754
01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:02.010
<v Speaker 1>I can just see the</v>

1755
01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:04.190
<v Speaker 4>fuck on shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fucking bullseyes isn't.</v>

1756
01:29:04.250 --> 01:29:08.910
<v Speaker 4>I still feel like a loser.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like that took me until I was in my</v>

1757
01:29:08.911 --> 01:29:13.911
<v Speaker 4>forties to realize that I can't have</v>
<v Speaker 4>anything like the price you pay for</v>

1758
01:29:14.401 --> 01:29:17.640
<v Speaker 4>fucking off on something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The price you pay in mental mortgage is</v>

1759
01:29:17.641 --> 01:29:19.350
<v Speaker 4>never worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just not worth it.</v>

1760
01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:22.950
<v Speaker 4>If I have shit that I have to get done,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have to get it done Because if I don't</v>

1761
01:29:22.951 --> 01:29:24.640
<v Speaker 4>get it done,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's gonna fucking haunting me.</v>

1762
01:29:24.780 --> 01:29:29.070
<v Speaker 4>but what is get it done and what is</v>
<v Speaker 4>within reason and that's what I had to</v>

1763
01:29:29.140 --> 01:29:33.540
<v Speaker 4>like hit my forties far.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Realize there is a diminishing return.</v>

1764
01:29:33.810 --> 01:29:35.070
<v Speaker 4>What is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well it's,</v>

1765
01:29:35.170 --> 01:29:37.080
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like have to get done.</v>

1766
01:29:37.081 --> 01:29:38.860
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to take care of your shit.</v>

1767
01:29:39.180 --> 01:29:39.790
<v Speaker 4>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

1768
01:29:39.790 --> 01:29:43.140
<v Speaker 4>but other shit like exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because if I don't exercise I do fucking</v>

1769
01:29:43.141 --> 01:29:46.350
<v Speaker 4>freak out because of my body's just so</v>
<v Speaker 4>used to it.</v>

1770
01:29:46.350 --> 01:29:50.250
<v Speaker 4>It's been doing it for so many years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if I don't do some form of rigorous</v>

1771
01:29:50.251 --> 01:29:51.300
<v Speaker 4>exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my body's like,</v>

1772
01:29:51.301 --> 01:29:53.100
<v Speaker 4>come on bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are you gonna make us just sit</v>

1773
01:29:53.101 --> 01:29:56.370
<v Speaker 4>around on the stand that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But we all have different standards or</v>

1774
01:29:56.410 --> 01:30:01.410
<v Speaker 4>or or perceptions of what we have to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where do you go,</v>

1775
01:30:02.250 --> 01:30:07.250
<v Speaker 4>what do I really have to do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would consistently obsessively make</v>

1776
01:30:07.771 --> 01:30:12.771
<v Speaker 4>lists of shit I have to do and then I</v>
<v Speaker 4>would find one from a year,</v>

1777
01:30:14.140 --> 01:30:18.250
<v Speaker 4>six months ago that I lost and made a</v>
<v Speaker 4>new list and I,</v>

1778
01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:23.320
<v Speaker 4>I didn't have to do any of that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I have to do shit.</v>

1779
01:30:23.850 --> 01:30:26.400
<v Speaker 4>That's definitely true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You definitely don't have to do</v>

1780
01:30:26.401 --> 01:30:28.260
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just have to survive,</v>

1781
01:30:28.350 --> 01:30:29.280
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Definitely.</v>

1782
01:30:29.550 --> 01:30:32.700
<v Speaker 4>But if you want to try to achieve</v>
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>

1783
01:30:32.701 --> 01:30:35.970
<v Speaker 4>like if you want to try,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you have a netflix special that</v>

1784
01:30:35.971 --> 01:30:39.600
<v Speaker 4>you're going to film in six months and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you decide I am going to piece together</v>

1785
01:30:39.601 --> 01:30:42.030
<v Speaker 4>a perspective and I'm going to try to</v>
<v Speaker 4>get this material,</v>

1786
01:30:42.170 --> 01:30:45.090
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to try to take it on the road,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm going to need to have some life</v>

1787
01:30:45.091 --> 01:30:45.690
<v Speaker 4>experiences.</v>

1788
01:30:45.690 --> 01:30:49.230
<v Speaker 4>So I'm going to need to go to the museum</v>
<v Speaker 4>of creationism.</v>

1789
01:30:49.510 --> 01:30:51.090
<v Speaker 4>It's in Kentucky.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to go there.</v>

1790
01:30:51.091 --> 01:30:53.550
<v Speaker 4>I want to fucking sit down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm talk to the people I'm going to.</v>

1791
01:30:53.551 --> 01:30:55.080
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to get us some information if</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1792
01:30:55.081 --> 01:30:57.780
<v Speaker 4>if you have some shit that you Want to</v>
<v Speaker 4>do,</v>

1793
01:30:58.020 --> 01:31:00.900
<v Speaker 4>then you have some shit that you need to</v>
<v Speaker 4>do in order to accomplish the thing that</v>

1794
01:31:00.901 --> 01:31:02.400
<v Speaker 4>you want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's real,</v>

1795
01:31:02.760 --> 01:31:05.640
<v Speaker 4>but it's only on your choice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but once that's when it's at its best</v>

1796
01:31:05.641 --> 01:31:08.070
<v Speaker 4>and that's the beautiful thing about</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you're doing,</v>

1797
01:31:08.071 --> 01:31:11.190
<v Speaker 4>what I'm been able to do and what it's a</v>
<v Speaker 4>matter of that are listening to this</v>

1798
01:31:11.191 --> 01:31:14.700
<v Speaker 4>that are self employed or they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>artists or that are trying to do that.</v>

1799
01:31:14.701 --> 01:31:17.190
<v Speaker 4>That's the ultimate goal is to do what</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're doing.</v>

1800
01:31:17.220 --> 01:31:22.220
<v Speaker 4>It's decipher between what you have to</v>
<v Speaker 4>do for you versus what you think you</v>

1801
01:31:24.241 --> 01:31:29.100
<v Speaker 4>have to do for other people or to live</v>
<v Speaker 4>up to the fans or to whatever.</v>

1802
01:31:29.490 --> 01:31:32.520
<v Speaker 4>What do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do I actually have to do versus</v>

1803
01:31:32.521 --> 01:31:37.110
<v Speaker 4>what I think I'm supposed to do and</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what I can't get rid of,</v>

1804
01:31:37.111 --> 01:31:40.880
<v Speaker 4>so I always think I'm supposed to do so</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have to.</v>

1805
01:31:40.950 --> 01:31:41.783
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's the key.</v>

1806
01:31:41.910 --> 01:31:44.880
<v Speaker 4>Here's one key that I've found.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is just my personal perspective.</v>

1807
01:31:44.910 --> 01:31:45.760
<v Speaker 4>Kettle pay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1808
01:31:46.300 --> 01:31:47.640
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

1809
01:31:47.641 --> 01:31:50.220
<v Speaker 4>Don't get an assistant when you get an</v>
<v Speaker 4>assistant,</v>

1810
01:31:50.250 --> 01:31:52.050
<v Speaker 4>you're just putting a bandaid on a</v>
<v Speaker 4>problem.</v>

1811
01:31:52.440 --> 01:31:54.570
<v Speaker 4>The problem is your life has gotten too</v>
<v Speaker 4>complicated.</v>

1812
01:31:54.571 --> 01:31:57.300
<v Speaker 4>For one person I have now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's who said,</v>

1813
01:31:57.301 --> 01:31:58.590
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you guys have a partnership.</v>

1814
01:31:58.620 --> 01:32:00.310
<v Speaker 4>This is a completely different</v>
<v Speaker 4>experience.</v>

1815
01:32:00.800 --> 01:32:02.770
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't have an assistant.</v>

<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Don't do shit you don't want to do when</v>

1848
01:33:28.121 --> 01:33:29.860
<v Speaker 4>you don't have to do it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's another one.</v>

1849
01:33:30.100 --> 01:33:31.660
<v Speaker 4>A lot of times people get famous and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they get,</v>

1850
01:33:31.750 --> 01:33:34.720
<v Speaker 4>they get successful and they get wealthy</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then they start thinking,</v>

1851
01:33:34.900 --> 01:33:37.390
<v Speaker 4>I just got a full group is going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we need to do movies,</v>

1852
01:33:37.391 --> 01:33:38.350
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to do.</v>

1853
01:33:38.500 --> 01:33:40.890
<v Speaker 4>We're going to do our own truck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what?</v>

1854
01:33:43.690 --> 01:33:46.590
<v Speaker 4>Don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go back to when you and I were 21.</v>

1855
01:33:46.670 --> 01:33:49.850
<v Speaker 4>What you started when you were like 24.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was 21,</v>

1856
01:33:51.170 --> 01:33:52.690
<v Speaker 4>but essentially we're in our early</v>
<v Speaker 4>twenties.</v>

1857
01:33:52.691 --> 01:33:56.200
<v Speaker 4>What did we want to do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We wanted to fucking make a living</v>

1858
01:33:56.201 --> 01:33:59.980
<v Speaker 4>telling jokes.</v>

<v Speaker 4>karaoke,</v>

1860
01:34:03.611 --> 01:34:07.510
<v Speaker 4>but comedy was a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could go up and sign on a list and</v>

1861
01:34:07.511 --> 01:34:09.850
<v Speaker 4>then try to get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because that's the embryonic stage,</v>

1862
01:34:09.851 --> 01:34:12.220
<v Speaker 4>but once you became a full multicell</v>
<v Speaker 4>organism,</v>

1863
01:34:12.520 --> 01:34:15.940
<v Speaker 4>when he became an actual like guys</v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to put together an act,</v>

1864
01:34:15.941 --> 01:34:20.860
<v Speaker 4>what was the ultimate goal?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just wanted to do it.</v>

1865
01:34:20.950 --> 01:34:22.960
<v Speaker 4>I wanted to be able to do it.</v>

1869
01:34:28.930 --> 01:34:32.740
<v Speaker 4>That was a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I spent three years of just going,</v>

1870
01:34:32.920 --> 01:34:37.920
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe I'm driving to Montana,</v>
<v Speaker 4>18 hours to get free cheese cubes at a</v>

1875
01:34:47.590 --> 01:34:52.150
<v Speaker 4>We stayed in a fucking storage house</v>
<v Speaker 4>where they stored canned goods.</v>

1876
01:34:52.270 --> 01:34:54.640
<v Speaker 4>They had cans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is an island you had to go to.</v>

1877
01:34:54.760 --> 01:34:56.800
<v Speaker 4>The people were so drunk they were</v>
<v Speaker 4>barely.</v>

1878
01:34:57.800 --> 01:35:00.020
<v Speaker 4>The audience is filmed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was no comedy to be had.</v>

1879
01:35:00.021 --> 01:35:02.510
<v Speaker 4>I never even got on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They canceled the show.</v>

<v Speaker 4>rooms in all of Massachusetts.</v>

<v Speaker 4>so we got a boat.</v>

1897
01:35:48.900 --> 01:35:52.880
<v Speaker 4>We took off some fucking stupid island</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the middle of nowhere where these</v>

<v Speaker 4>people were just drinking himself to</v>
<v Speaker 4>death.</v>

<v Speaker 4>She looked like don burris with a dress</v>

<v Speaker 2>It was probably worse,</v>

1908
01:36:30.290 --> 01:36:33.920
<v Speaker 2>but most of the time I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe I'm doing this in the</v>

1929
01:37:44.300 --> 01:37:48.650
<v Speaker 2>jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember the time you brought me to a</v>

1930
01:37:49.520 --> 01:37:54.020
<v Speaker 2>ufc in vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only time I've seen it live and you</v>

1931
01:37:54.021 --> 01:37:55.800
<v Speaker 2>walked through the crowd</v>

1932
01:37:56.460 --> 01:38:00.390
<v Speaker 1>as they're all lined up to get into this</v>
<v Speaker 1>monster agro fucking</v>

1933
01:38:03.310 --> 01:38:06.190
<v Speaker 1>and just everyone's just glommed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>joel.</v>

1934
01:38:06.270 --> 01:38:09.750
<v Speaker 1>We get a picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't get a picture with 3000</v>

1935
01:38:09.751 --> 01:38:12.240
<v Speaker 1>fucking people that are in line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1936
01:38:12.241 --> 01:38:15.500
<v Speaker 1>you can't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you just walked through like you're</v>

1937
01:38:15.510 --> 01:38:18.360
<v Speaker 1>fucking moses part and sees a cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1938
01:38:18.370 --> 01:38:22.860
<v Speaker 1>I gotta go gotta go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have three people when I'm trying to</v>

1939
01:38:22.861 --> 01:38:24.240
<v Speaker 1>rush out and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>god,</v>

1940
01:38:24.480 --> 01:38:27.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm such a fucking dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>

1941
01:38:27.140 --> 01:38:30.390
<v Speaker 1>I try to run out the back door like</v>
<v Speaker 1>hedberg used to do.</v>

1942
01:38:30.570 --> 01:38:35.570
<v Speaker 1>Hedberg was legendary on a one nighter</v>
<v Speaker 1>with 100 people not asking for</v>

1943
01:38:36.331 --> 01:38:40.530
<v Speaker 1>autographs because he's not famous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he couldn't even deal with people</v>

1944
01:38:40.620 --> 01:38:42.510
<v Speaker 1>tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>giving him feedback.</v>

1945
01:38:43.530 --> 01:38:45.790
<v Speaker 1>He just run out the back door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1946
01:38:45.970 --> 01:38:49.500
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely an issue if you really</v>
<v Speaker 1>are worried about that.</v>

1947
01:38:49.560 --> 01:38:52.710
<v Speaker 1>If you're thinking about feedback or if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just were worried about interacting</v>

1948
01:38:52.711 --> 01:38:55.530
<v Speaker 1>with these people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>worth is is it's a weighted</v>

1949
01:38:55.531 --> 01:38:57.000
<v Speaker 1>conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1950
01:38:57.001 --> 01:38:58.650
<v Speaker 1>like they like you and you don't know</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

1951
01:38:58.920 --> 01:39:02.120
<v Speaker 1>so it's weighted and the problem with</v>
<v Speaker 1>weighted conversations,</v>

1952
01:39:02.130 --> 01:39:07.130
<v Speaker 1>the big one is that those can become</v>
<v Speaker 1>intoxicating and you could only want to</v>

1953
01:39:07.201 --> 01:39:08.610
<v Speaker 1>have a weighted conversation.</v>

1954
01:39:08.850 --> 01:39:12.780
<v Speaker 1>You only want to have conversations with</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who adore you and you can't.</v>

1955
01:39:12.781 --> 01:39:14.790
<v Speaker 1>Those are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are terrible choices.</v>

1956
01:39:14.791 --> 01:39:17.460
<v Speaker 1>Like that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a reality that only exists for</v>

1957
01:39:17.461 --> 01:39:20.370
<v Speaker 1>very few people and it's not in our</v>
<v Speaker 1>code.</v>

1958
01:39:20.371 --> 01:39:23.820
<v Speaker 1>We don't understand how to handle that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially when it comes to you for no</v>

1959
01:39:23.821 --> 01:39:25.950
<v Speaker 1>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're a child actor on a</v>

1960
01:39:25.951 --> 01:39:27.990
<v Speaker 1>television show and you've never known</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything else.</v>

1961
01:39:28.060 --> 01:39:31.350
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that's an impossible mathematical</v>

1962
01:39:31.351 --> 01:39:34.290
<v Speaker 1>equation to ask some little kid to grow</v>
<v Speaker 1>up in.</v>

1963
01:39:34.480 --> 01:39:38.430
<v Speaker 1>You are going to grow up and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna have requirements on you that no</v>

1964
01:39:38.431 --> 01:39:41.250
<v Speaker 1>human being is going to be able to as</v>
<v Speaker 1>rate with no one's gonna understand,</v>

1965
01:39:41.251 --> 01:39:44.310
<v Speaker 1>you're essentially a prince.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know you're born and you're five</v>

1966
01:39:44.311 --> 01:39:46.350
<v Speaker 1>years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're on a tv show and the world</v>

1967
01:39:46.351 --> 01:39:48.210
<v Speaker 1>screams whenever they see you on</v>
<v Speaker 1>televIsion.</v>

1968
01:39:48.211 --> 01:39:49.044
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make any sense.</v>

1969
01:39:49.050 --> 01:39:52.290
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I get cut out of it.</v>

1970
01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:52.770
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1971
01:39:52.770 --> 01:39:55.440
<v Speaker 1>I saw a trailer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chris rock movie.</v>

1972
01:39:55.441 --> 01:39:57.660
<v Speaker 1>I take five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take five.</v>

1973
01:39:57.750 --> 01:39:59.090
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he uh,</v>

1974
01:39:59.110 --> 01:40:04.110
<v Speaker 1>I believe in the trailer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says that's a problem with being a</v>

1975
01:40:04.141 --> 01:40:08.040
<v Speaker 1>celebrity is you can only complain to</v>
<v Speaker 1>other celebrities.</v>

1976
01:40:08.100 --> 01:40:13.100
<v Speaker 1>Will there's loss using that level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I think that's his line in that</v>

1977
01:40:13.381 --> 01:40:15.990
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't watch it because I got cut out</v>

1978
01:40:15.991 --> 01:40:18.630
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's so famous we can't be friends with</v>

1979
01:40:18.631 --> 01:40:21.120
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what I mean?</v>

1980
01:40:21.200 --> 01:40:23.010
<v Speaker 1>like we're not famous enough to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>friends with.</v>

01:40:24.150 --> 01:40:25.000
<v Speaker 1>I say hi.</v>

2007
01:41:43.050 --> 01:41:46.750
<v Speaker 4>That's the way I think joey diaz</v>
<v Speaker 4>might've been the instigator.</v>

2008
01:41:46.930 --> 01:41:49.440
<v Speaker 4>I think joey dee is my nigga.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got fuck with me.</v>

<v Speaker 4>soldier because when that was,</v>

2010
01:41:55.211 --> 01:42:00.211
<v Speaker 4>when diaz was trying to figure out how</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be dheas dheas between 96 and 98 was</v>

2011
01:42:00.461 --> 01:42:04.770
<v Speaker 4>in his like hatching phase and then he</v>
<v Speaker 4>burst out of his egg and became joey d</v>

01:42:04.771 --> 01:42:08.590
<v Speaker 4>as in [inaudible] 99 and I'll never met.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll never forget it because I take them</v>

2013
01:42:08.591 --> 01:42:11.860
<v Speaker 4>on the road with me and all of a sudden</v>
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't follow him like around</v>

2014
01:42:11.861 --> 01:42:13.270
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] 98.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't follow him.</v>

2015
01:42:13.271 --> 01:42:15.070
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>follow that guy.</v>

2016
01:42:15.130 --> 01:42:16.900
<v Speaker 4>Oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were in west orange,</v>

2017
01:42:16.901 --> 01:42:18.960
<v Speaker 4>New Jersey.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The same place where the guy bought a</v>

2018
01:42:19.330 --> 01:42:21.760
<v Speaker 4>for the comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He bought a bunch of fucking nyquil</v>

2019
01:42:21.761 --> 01:42:23.480
<v Speaker 4>bottles that I was talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2020
01:42:23.660 --> 01:42:24.493
<v Speaker 4>same place.</v>

2021
01:42:24.550 --> 01:42:26.200
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I brought in joey and this is also the</v>

2022
01:42:26.201 --> 01:42:29.800
<v Speaker 4>same place where joey notoriously would</v>
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>

2023
01:42:29.830 --> 01:42:31.720
<v Speaker 4>he was a wild man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just disappeared.</v>

2024
01:42:31.750 --> 01:42:34.390
<v Speaker 4>Shit would go wrong or right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2025
01:42:34.391 --> 01:42:37.610
<v Speaker 4>he'd have a fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a big bag of coke and some crazy girl</v>

2026
01:42:37.611 --> 01:42:39.430
<v Speaker 4>and it'd be holed up and he never make</v>
<v Speaker 4>it to a show.</v>

2027
01:42:39.670 --> 01:42:41.950
<v Speaker 4>So I didn't want to not use joey</v>
<v Speaker 4>anymore,</v>

2028
01:42:41.951 --> 01:42:44.110
<v Speaker 4>so I started bringing ari on the road</v>
<v Speaker 4>with me,</v>

2029
01:42:44.420 --> 01:42:48.100
<v Speaker 4>other guys in the room with me as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So joey didn't show up.</v>

2030
01:42:48.101 --> 01:42:52.480
<v Speaker 4>At least I had like one opening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got booked at a uncle funnies in</v>

2031
01:42:52.481 --> 01:42:55.780
<v Speaker 4>davie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Florida with otto and george because he</v>

2032
01:42:55.781 --> 01:43:00.781
<v Speaker 4>had such a reputation of not showing up</v>
<v Speaker 4>for shows because he was a crack addict.</v>

2033
01:43:01.480 --> 01:43:06.480
<v Speaker 4>That's a build it as a triple x show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they would go headlong in case he</v>

2034
01:43:06.761 --> 01:43:07.900
<v Speaker 4>went on a crack binge.</v>

2035
01:43:07.900 --> 01:43:12.900
<v Speaker 4>I could cover the time because we're</v>
<v Speaker 4>both of an ilk of triple x.</v>

2036
01:43:13.480 --> 01:43:15.820
<v Speaker 4>You will be for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'd fit right in there.</v>

2037
01:43:15.850 --> 01:43:17.470
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>back then I could do.</v>

2038
01:43:17.550 --> 01:43:20.440
<v Speaker 4>I was just all dick jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's triple x.</v>

2039
01:43:20.560 --> 01:43:25.560
<v Speaker 4>I'm not on youporn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did a bunch of jersey shore gaze with</v>

2040

2083
01:45:56.450 --> 01:46:00.830
<v Speaker 2>In a fucking hotel room at the montreal</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy feStival and I thought,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm definitely going to die and the</v>

01:46:06.651 --> 01:46:11.651
<v Speaker 2>other people are going to die before me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus fucking Dylan Moran falling asleep</v>

2086
01:46:12.981 --> 01:46:17.030
<v Speaker 2>with a lit cigarette,</v>
<v Speaker 2>waiting for more cocktail to be brought</v>

2087
01:46:17.031 --> 01:46:20.300
<v Speaker 2>up to the room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was at the fucking gas station in</v>

2088
01:46:20.301 --> 01:46:24.830
<v Speaker 2>hollywood right next to the laugh</v>
<v Speaker 2>factory for the night driving home and I</v>

2089
01:46:24.831 --> 01:46:27.560
<v Speaker 2>never tried.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried to navigate gays and gentlemen,</v>

2090
01:46:27.590 --> 01:46:30.470
<v Speaker 2>if you're ever near the laugh factory</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you need gas,</v>

2091
01:46:30.471 --> 01:46:32.240
<v Speaker 2>we're going to stop and do a commercial</v>
<v Speaker 2>break.</v>

2092
01:46:32.330 --> 01:46:33.590
<v Speaker 2>Go to the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

2093
01:46:33.650 --> 01:46:37.130
<v Speaker 2>This fucking guy walks up to me and he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>cracked out of his head.</v>

2094
01:46:37.190 --> 01:46:38.720
<v Speaker 2>there's something wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something wrong.</v>

2095
01:46:39.050 --> 01:46:41.030
<v Speaker 2>He's asking a bunch of weird fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>questions.</v>

2096
01:46:41.031 --> 01:46:43.430
<v Speaker 2>he's real speedy and fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's smoking.</v>

2097
01:46:44.810 --> 01:46:48.410
<v Speaker 2>When I went to pump gas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone had done some fucking sneaky</v>

2098
01:46:48.411 --> 01:46:50.120
<v Speaker 2>trick where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2099
01:46:50.610 --> 01:46:51.361
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you press,</v>

2100
01:46:51.361 --> 01:46:52.560
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what gauge do you want?</v>

2101
01:46:52.600 --> 01:46:54.090
<v Speaker 4>You press the button,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you pull the thing out.</v>

2102
01:46:54.450 --> 01:46:59.450
<v Speaker 4>They had left it already pulled back aNd</v>
<v Speaker 4>locked in place some spraying,</v>

2103
01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:02.830
<v Speaker 4>spraying gasoline.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I let it go.</v>

2104
01:47:02.831 --> 01:47:04.380
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck is this?</v>

2105
01:47:04.830 --> 01:47:06.300
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2106
01:47:06.301 --> 01:47:08.810
<v Speaker 4>I undo the little thing that keeps it on</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there.</v>

2107
01:47:08.850 --> 01:47:12.450
<v Speaker 4>But there's gas all over the floor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I started pumping gas in my car</v>

2108
01:47:12.451 --> 01:47:14.310
<v Speaker 4>and this guy walks up with a cigarette.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh no,</v>

2109
01:47:14.770 --> 01:47:18.300
<v Speaker 4>he's got a cigarette just a few feet</v>
<v Speaker 4>from this gas on the ground.</v>

2110
01:47:18.510 --> 01:47:22.020
<v Speaker 4>And if the guy decided just throw a</v>
<v Speaker 4>cigarette on the ground.</v>

2111
01:47:22.021 --> 01:47:24.630
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're literally depending upon the</v>

2112
01:47:24.631 --> 01:47:29.631
<v Speaker 4>choices of a fucking moron to not have</v>
<v Speaker 4>my car blow up me die.</v>

2113
01:47:30.340 --> 01:47:34.560
<v Speaker 4>I'm literally thinking right now I might</v>
<v Speaker 4>have to sprint out of this position</v>

2114
01:47:34.561 --> 01:47:37.120
<v Speaker 4>because have you ever seen what happens</v>
<v Speaker 4>to people when they get in those,</v>

2115
01:47:37.350 --> 01:47:40.320
<v Speaker 4>those like they say that you shouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>even have a cell phone out.</v>

2116
01:47:40.470 --> 01:47:43.020
<v Speaker 4>IT's there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's potential for a cell phone to</v>

2117
01:47:43.021 --> 01:47:45.570
<v Speaker 4>have a spark and that spark ignites the</v>
<v Speaker 4>fumes.</v>

2118
01:47:45.571 --> 01:47:48.750
<v Speaker 4>That fuel ignites the gas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And people have died like that.</v>

2119
01:47:48.780 --> 01:47:50.790
<v Speaker 4>It's very rare,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's one of those,</v>

2120
01:47:50.940 --> 01:47:54.570
<v Speaker 4>the right amount of humidity in the air,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the right amount of static electricity.</v>

2121
01:47:54.660 --> 01:47:57.840
<v Speaker 4>Weird shit can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This fucking guY's just standing there</v>

2122
01:47:57.841 --> 01:47:59.910
<v Speaker 4>with a cigarette and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a nice car man.</v>

2123
01:48:00.150 --> 01:48:02.880
<v Speaker 4>Which get it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got it from a car store</v>

2124
01:48:04.610 --> 01:48:07.350
<v Speaker 4>and then the guy in the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>loudspeakers going,</v>

2125
01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:10.600
<v Speaker 4>sir,</v>
<v Speaker 4>will you step away from the pumps?</v>

2126
01:48:10.690 --> 01:48:14.190
<v Speaker 4>You're smoking a cigarette while you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>while you're standing in the pumps.</v>

2127
01:48:14.490 --> 01:48:19.490
<v Speaker 4>So this guY is angry now because they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>suggesting that he shouldn't be near the</v>

2128
01:48:19.561 --> 01:48:22.770
<v Speaker 4>pump.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So then he holds his hand up over where</v>

2129
01:48:22.771 --> 01:48:26.250
<v Speaker 4>the gases real touch and go,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I am not going to fucking burn to death</v>

2131

<v Speaker 4>for some moron and I'm trying to figure</v>
<v Speaker 4>out what I'm going to do.</v>

2132
01:48:32.370 --> 01:48:33.660
<v Speaker 4>like what am I doing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do what do I do?</v>

2133
01:48:33.661 --> 01:48:36.570
<v Speaker 4>Do I jump out of the way or do I just</v>
<v Speaker 4>charge at this guy?</v>

2134
01:48:36.720 --> 01:48:38.490
<v Speaker 4>like there's one of two things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is gonna happen.</v>

2135
01:48:38.640 --> 01:48:41.220
<v Speaker 4>Either I'm going to jump out of the way</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he's going to light this whole</v>

2136
01:48:41.221 --> 01:48:44.790

<v Speaker 4>the road.</v>

2137
01:48:44.940 --> 01:48:49.940
<v Speaker 4>I might get to laurel canyon before the</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking gigantic explosion and all these</v>

2138
01:48:50.221 --> 01:48:52.830

2141
01:48:58.770 --> 01:49:01.410
<v Speaker 4>I don't have any idea what happened to</v>
<v Speaker 4>you that got you to this position,</v>

2142

<v Speaker 4>looking at me and you're holding a</v>

2143
01:49:05.221 --> 01:49:09.630
<v Speaker 4>cigarette over where the gasoline</v>
<v Speaker 4>spilled on the ground because the guy in</v>

2144

<v Speaker 4>six,</v>

2147
01:49:20.671 --> 01:49:24.060

01:49:34.230 --> 01:49:37.140
<v Speaker 4>That's how racist I am.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was something wrong with this</v>

<v Speaker 4>There was a bunch of.</v>

2154
01:49:38.431 --> 01:49:39.840
<v Speaker 4>It was probably a bunch of things wrong</v>
<v Speaker 4>with them.</v>

2155
01:49:40.200 --> 01:49:42.420
<v Speaker 4>I think there's probably drugs and it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably something else.</v>

2156
01:49:42.690 --> 01:49:45.810
<v Speaker 4>It was stupid and drugs together,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there was definitely some drugs</v>

2157
01:49:46.200 --> 01:49:47.070

<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2208
01:52:20.190 --> 01:52:25.190
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's what I do all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I drive an hour and 45 minutes from</v>

2209
01:52:25.481 --> 01:52:30.110

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:40.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm not afraid of death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to avoid it.</v>

2213
01:52:40.840 --> 01:52:42.460
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just don't want to die because an</v>

2214
01:52:42.490 --> 01:52:46.010
<v Speaker 1>assholes doing fucking truck or math.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He decided to start</v>

01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:49.400
<v Speaker 4>beating off all over his fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>steering wheel and he can't hold onto</v>

2216
01:52:49.401 --> 01:52:53.660
<v Speaker 4>the thing when he hits a possum and his</v>
<v Speaker 4>things all slippery like lube and he</v>

01:53:02.091 --> 01:53:03.920
<v Speaker 4>what.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why I drink is beautiful because</v>

2220
01:53:03.921 --> 01:53:06.050
<v Speaker 4>what drinking does is it limits</v>
<v Speaker 4>inhibitions.</v>

2221
01:53:06.051 --> 01:53:08.150
<v Speaker 4>That blows them away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It takes them away.</v>

2222
01:53:08.151 --> 01:53:10.120
<v Speaker 4>It brings you to a place where you don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>care anymore.</v>

<v Speaker 4>You'Re like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can enjoy this moment.</v>

2224
01:53:12.590 --> 01:53:15.230
<v Speaker 4>There's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's some fucking magic shit in that.</v>

2225
01:53:15.680 --> 01:53:19.250
<v Speaker 4>The the whole key to whether it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>drinking or smoking weed or doing</v>

2226
01:53:19.251 --> 01:53:21.230
<v Speaker 4>mushrooms are doing nothing or</v>
<v Speaker 4>exercising.</v>

2227
01:53:21.430 --> 01:53:25.310
<v Speaker 4>It's like this harmonious balance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there's a path.</v>

<v Speaker 4>This is from brian's book.</v>

2232
01:53:37.790 --> 01:53:40.760
<v Speaker 4>Alcohol cannot cure every problem in</v>
<v Speaker 4>life,</v>

2233
01:53:41.050 --> 01:53:45.170
<v Speaker 4>but if we removed the problems that it</v>
<v Speaker 4>can cure than the path is clear.</v>

2234
01:53:46.990 --> 01:53:47.930
<v Speaker 4>Brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>

<v Speaker 4>that's true.</v>

2238

01:53:59.391 --> 01:54:00.650
<v Speaker 4>drink.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2240
01:54:00.940 --> 01:54:03.350
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying that drinking is the end</v>
<v Speaker 4>all be all,</v>

2241
01:54:03.351 --> 01:54:06.830
<v Speaker 4>but it's also an option and as soon as</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not an option for people.</v>

2242
01:54:06.831 --> 01:54:08.660
<v Speaker 4>There's two.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's two reasons why it's not an</v>

2243
01:54:08.661 --> 01:54:10.130
<v Speaker 4>option.</v>

<v Speaker 4>know people that just fucking have that</v>

2289
01:56:06.810 --> 01:56:11.100
<v Speaker 4>First shipping on the curb.</v>

2290
01:56:11.101 --> 01:56:16.050
<v Speaker 4>one of those</v>
<v Speaker 4>was there for that,</v>

2291
01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:21.300
<v Speaker 4>but at her best she was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She was beautiful.</v>

2293
01:56:23.610 --> 01:56:27.030

<v Speaker 4>that's the most magical thing about</v>

2294
01:56:27.031 --> 01:56:29.160
<v Speaker 4>people is that they're not like the</v>
<v Speaker 4>idea,</v>

2295
01:56:29.161 --> 01:56:33.480
<v Speaker 4>like this is why I hate when people</v>
<v Speaker 4>start to shame people or attack people</v>

2296
01:56:33.481 --> 01:56:38.220
<v Speaker 4>on twitter and go after people because</v>
<v Speaker 4>you cannot be defined by moments.</v>

2297
01:56:38.520 --> 01:56:42.540
<v Speaker 4>You're defined by the culmination of</v>
<v Speaker 4>your life's experiences and your</v>

2298
01:56:42.541 --> 01:56:46.620
<v Speaker 4>interactions and as soon as you find</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone who's trying to,</v>

2299
01:56:46.830 --> 01:56:51.830
<v Speaker 4>like I just label someone or lock</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone into one partIcular moment,</v>

2300
01:56:54.180 --> 01:56:58.170
<v Speaker 4>you're finding someone who's just trying</v>
<v Speaker 4>to avoid all the flaws they have in</v>

2301
01:56:58.171 --> 01:57:01.170
<v Speaker 4>their self when no one's perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 4>none of us are.</v>

2302
01:57:01.310 --> 01:57:03.930
<v Speaker 4>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Idea that you can lock a quote down</v>

2303
01:57:03.931 --> 01:57:07.770
<v Speaker 4>and put it doug stand hope said that he</v>
<v Speaker 4>thinks that fucking,</v>

2304
01:57:07.771 --> 01:57:08.640
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

02:00:00.131 --> 02:00:03.280
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure have talents,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but joey diaz has a very marketable</v>

2363
02:00:03.281 --> 02:00:05.350
<v Speaker 4>talent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he goes onstage and kills and you</v>

2364
02:00:05.351 --> 02:00:08.620
<v Speaker 4>forgive him for everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When Julie Diaz goes on stage and</v>

<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2369
02:00:19.010 --> 02:00:21.670
<v Speaker 4>that is the reason why,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like in the late nineties,</v>

2370
02:00:21.671 --> 02:00:25.750
<v Speaker 4>I brought an extra eye opener.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was only because of joey because I</v>

2371
02:00:25.751 --> 02:00:30.751
<v Speaker 4>just realized that that's what started</v>
<v Speaker 4>that conversation was joey diaz one time</v>

2372
02:00:31.721 --> 02:00:36.721
<v Speaker 4>the lake shore theater.</v>

2373
02:00:37.600 --> 02:00:41.800
<v Speaker 4>he just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the last minute hours before it calls</v>

2374
02:00:41.801 --> 02:00:45.880
<v Speaker 4>up the book or it says I can get some</v>
<v Speaker 4>shit going on.</v>

2375
02:00:46.120 --> 02:00:47.150
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2376
02:00:47.260 --> 02:00:47.770
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shit happens.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I'm working at rascals and this is.</v>

2381
02:00:59.260 --> 02:01:03.430
<v Speaker 4>This is before I decided to start</v>
<v Speaker 4>bringing the second opening act and it's</v>

2382
02:01:03.431 --> 02:01:05.800
<v Speaker 4>the reason why first time he just</v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't show up.</v>

2383
02:01:05.980 --> 02:01:08.290
<v Speaker 4>He says he didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know.</v>

2384
02:01:08.291 --> 02:01:13.291
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know the god and talk to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't sure if it was real and then</v>

2385
02:01:13.871 --> 02:01:16.150
<v Speaker 4>the next night,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they had to get some local guy.</v>

2386
02:01:16.151 --> 02:01:18.130
<v Speaker 4>Look.</v>

2387
02:01:18.131 --> 02:01:20.620
<v Speaker 4>starts 40 minutes late.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The whole thing's a disaster.</v>

2388
02:01:20.830 --> 02:01:21.960
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>guy does well.</v>

02:01:22.510 --> 02:01:23.780
<v Speaker 4>We salvage the show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2390
02:01:24.520 --> 02:01:27.550
<v Speaker 4>Second night,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an hour before the show,</v>

2391
02:01:27.700 --> 02:01:29.920
<v Speaker 4>I finally get a job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He had a pager back then.</v>

2392
02:01:30.100 --> 02:01:33.520
<v Speaker 4>If you lost that pager,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was two years ago.</v>

2393
02:01:34.990 --> 02:01:39.230
<v Speaker 4>The second night he called,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get 'em on the phone and he goes,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>with them,</v>

2400
02:01:53.540 --> 02:01:56.300
<v Speaker 1>so I need to get another opening act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to give us more money.</v>

2401
02:01:58.010 --> 02:02:03.010

2411
02:02:34.641 --> 02:02:37.370
<v Speaker 1>take them to the dance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but once they're at the dance that you</v>

2412
02:02:37.371 --> 02:02:38.720
<v Speaker 1>can tell them where the good music is.</v>

2413
02:02:38.960 --> 02:02:42.230
<v Speaker 1>Unless after the dance they start biting</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

2414
02:02:42.260 --> 02:02:46.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is all sorts of levels of fucked up</v>

2418
02:02:53.510 --> 02:02:57.020

<v Speaker 1>I think we both realized we're fucked up</v>

2419
02:02:57.021 --> 02:03:01.400
<v Speaker 1>in very different ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're both channels were functional</v>

02:03:01.430 --> 02:03:04.070
<v Speaker 1>and we're both nice guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that'S one of the things like when</v>

2421
02:03:04.071 --> 02:03:07.760

<v Speaker 1>A lot of people forget that's the most</v>

2422
02:03:07.761 --> 02:03:10.040
<v Speaker 1>important part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the most important things</v>

2423
02:03:10.041 --> 02:03:15.041
<v Speaker 1>you see fucking guys that you thought</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't you retire when I started comedy</v>

<v Speaker 1>while they're still working there</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're nice guys and they're</v>

2425
02:03:19.491 --> 02:03:21.890
<v Speaker 1>friends with the owner even though they</v>

<v Speaker 4>Like ever since he figured it out,</v>

2464
02:04:55.330 --> 02:04:56.041
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

2465

<v Speaker 4>I just love them and give them hugs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>he was a door guy,</v>

2470
02:05:06.331 --> 02:05:08.490
<v Speaker 4>the store.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I started taking them on the road with</v>

2471
02:05:08.491 --> 02:05:11.880
<v Speaker 4>me and giving them money to do gigs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the first time I took him as a,</v>

2472
02:05:12.150 --> 02:05:16.920
<v Speaker 4>I think the first gig he ever did with</v>
<v Speaker 4>me was the comedy works in denver and</v>

2473
02:05:16.921 --> 02:05:20.120
<v Speaker 4>Mike Young,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she used to go on the road with me and</v>

2474
02:05:20.130 --> 02:05:22.830
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I called my guns back like the early</v>

2475
02:05:22.830 --> 02:05:24.770
<v Speaker 4>days.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a flip phone and I called Mike</v>

2476
02:05:24.770 --> 02:05:25.603
<v Speaker 4>Young ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mike young.</v>

2477
02:05:25.770 --> 02:05:28.860
<v Speaker 4>I go because Mike Young had to cancel</v>

2484
02:05:45.570 --> 02:05:47.580
<v Speaker 4>He was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The only reason why he was there was</v>

2485
02:05:47.581 --> 02:05:49.920
<v Speaker 4>because joe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he couldn't come to denver because he</v>

<v Speaker 4>Joey and his trading order with the club</v>
<v Speaker 4>that he literally could not go in the</v>

2606

<v Speaker 4>Well that's what it'll do to you.</v>

2607
02:12:29.350 --> 02:12:31.450
<v Speaker 4>That wasn't the improv night was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2608
02:12:31.460 --> 02:12:32.220
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

2609
02:12:32.220 --> 02:12:37.220
<v Speaker 4>That was as.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'd always a smart move.</v>

2610
02:12:38.320 --> 02:12:41.500
<v Speaker 4>The dmt was a smart move.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were doing the mancho when we came</v>

2611
02:12:41.501 --> 02:12:45.490
<v Speaker 4>over to my place to try to write and try</v>
<v Speaker 4>to storm ideas and come up with some new</v>

2612
02:12:45.491 --> 02:12:49.510
<v Speaker 4>sketches and just and then deal with the</v>
<v Speaker 4>hand that we'd been dealt because stan</v>

2613
02:12:49.511 --> 02:12:50.530
<v Speaker 4>hope and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we both,</v>

2614
02:12:50.720 --> 02:12:53.470
<v Speaker 4>we had this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to name any names,</v>

2615
02:12:53.471 --> 02:12:58.471
<v Speaker 4>but there's a bunch of people that sold</v>
<v Speaker 4>us an idea that we could go in and do</v>

2616
02:12:58.631 --> 02:13:03.120
<v Speaker 4>something chaotic executives,</v>
<v Speaker 4>executive teams.</v>

2617
02:13:03.210 --> 02:13:06.610
<v Speaker 4>They're fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People wanted to get us attached.</v>

2618
02:13:06.640 --> 02:13:10.060
<v Speaker 4>If we were attached,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they knew they had some names and they</v>

2619
02:13:10.061 --> 02:13:11.830
<v Speaker 4>could take that and they could resell</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

2620
02:13:11.900 --> 02:13:12.733
<v Speaker 4>so that's what they did.</v>

2621
02:13:12.940 --> 02:13:16.330
<v Speaker 4>But then once we were working,</v>
<v Speaker 4>once we asked on the set,</v>

2622
02:13:16.600 --> 02:13:21.600
<v Speaker 4>they had very different ideas as to what</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would be versus what we had and our</v>

2623
02:13:22.871 --> 02:13:26.800
<v Speaker 4>ideas were based on the conversations</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we had that made us agree to do it</v>

2624
02:13:26.801 --> 02:13:29.590
<v Speaker 4>in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas their ideas are based on the old</v>

2625
02:13:29.591 --> 02:13:32.670
<v Speaker 4>shows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there was a little manipulation,</v>

2626
02:13:32.671 --> 02:13:34.600
<v Speaker 4>but that's just part of what the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 4>happened.</v>

2627
02:13:34.601 --> 02:13:38.640
<v Speaker 4>So we would go back to my.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We went back to my place one night and I</v>

2628
02:13:38.641 --> 02:13:43.560
<v Speaker 4>don't remember whether we decided it was</v>
<v Speaker 4>the end where this was the end of this</v>

2629
02:13:43.561 --> 02:13:48.420
<v Speaker 4>show and we had to write these monologue</v>
<v Speaker 4>or whatever bullshit we were already</v>

2630
02:13:48.421 --> 02:13:50.130
<v Speaker 4>going through,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like such stupid shit.</v>

2631
02:13:50.131 --> 02:13:55.110
<v Speaker 4>Like we had this game show called.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was called make me hard.</v>

2632
02:13:55.140 --> 02:13:58.560
<v Speaker 4>That sort of supposed to be called.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what doug's original name for it</v>

2633
02:13:58.561 --> 02:13:59.394
<v Speaker 4>was because it was your idea.</v>

2634
02:13:59.430 --> 02:14:01.770
<v Speaker 2>Make me laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was a game show.</v>

2635
02:14:01.890 --> 02:14:06.210
<v Speaker 2>That was a where you get a contestant</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's three comedians if you can</v>

2640
02:14:19.741 --> 02:14:22.350
<v Speaker 2>to not laugh while three comedians</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucked with them.</v>

2641
02:14:22.890 --> 02:14:27.890
<v Speaker 2>So we were doing a spoof called make me</v>
<v Speaker 2>hard where someone tried to not get a</v>

<v Speaker 4>it was a totally different story.</v>

2682
02:16:34.810 --> 02:16:38.290
<v Speaker 4>Once the paperwork had been signed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were committed to this project.</v>

2683
02:16:38.920 --> 02:16:43.330
<v Speaker 4>Then there was the executives,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the executives sort of had control over</v>

2684
02:16:43.331 --> 02:16:46.900

<v Speaker 4>doing something that wasn't what we set</v>

2688
02:16:57.880 --> 02:17:00.130

<v Speaker 4>and then there was like a bunch of</v>

2689
02:17:00.131 --> 02:17:02.860
<v Speaker 4>arguments and one of them was how the</v>

2718
02:18:17.860 --> 02:18:22.860
<v Speaker 4>A big fat fucking guy deck crew,</v>
<v Speaker 4>giant balls and an old ladies pantyhose.</v>

2719
02:18:24.100 --> 02:18:27.010
<v Speaker 4>They were ridiculous as balls are</v>
<v Speaker 4>comical in their own.</v>

2720
02:18:27.760 --> 02:18:29.620
<v Speaker 4>Look at him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He does not look real.</v>

2721
02:18:29.680 --> 02:18:34.000
<v Speaker 4>You'd have to sell me on joining.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's one of the greatest human beings</v>

2722
02:18:34.001 --> 02:18:35.500
<v Speaker 4>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Walked the face of the fire in the</v>

2723
02:18:35.501 --> 02:18:36.161
<v Speaker 4>background.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2724
02:18:36.161 --> 02:18:37.330
<v Speaker 4>Fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Austin,</v>

2725
02:18:37.331 --> 02:18:38.740
<v Speaker 4>Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's back.</v>

2726
02:18:38.741 --> 02:18:40.360
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that place doesn't exist anymore.</v>

2727
02:18:40.570 --> 02:18:42.880
<v Speaker 4>That place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a dude pounded on my door asking</v>

2728
02:18:42.881 --> 02:18:46.410
<v Speaker 4>me for someone named ed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was looking for crack.</v>

2729
02:18:46.790 --> 02:18:49.720
<v Speaker 4>It was like a crack house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2730
02:18:49.900 --> 02:18:50.800
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wait a minute.</v>

2731
02:18:51.190 --> 02:18:53.230
<v Speaker 4>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to take that back.</v>

2732
02:18:53.470 --> 02:18:55.090
<v Speaker 4>That's actually austin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Texas.</v>

2733
02:18:55.120 --> 02:18:56.980
<v Speaker 4>That's not houston.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's austin,</v>

2734
02:18:56.981 --> 02:18:58.420
<v Speaker 4>Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was Texas.</v>

2735
02:18:58.630 --> 02:19:00.480
<v Speaker 4>Now I'm regrouping.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's in.</v>

2736
02:19:00.510 --> 02:19:04.210
<v Speaker 4>That's the place that's down the street</v>
<v Speaker 4>from cap city comedy club.</v>

2737
02:19:05.230 --> 02:19:07.660
<v Speaker 4>He's the best.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's from a blog that I wrote called</v>

2738
02:19:07.661 --> 02:19:10.000
<v Speaker 4>happy pills because you still read a</v>
<v Speaker 4>blog.</v>

2739
02:19:10.280 --> 02:19:12.910
<v Speaker 4>Not not much anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I keep it in myself.</v>

2740
02:19:12.911 --> 02:19:14.890
<v Speaker 4>I write them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they become material.</v>

2741
02:19:15.160 --> 02:19:19.570
<v Speaker 4>What I found was that I was writing</v>
<v Speaker 4>blogs and then I was taking some of the</v>

2742
02:19:19.571 --> 02:19:22.570
<v Speaker 4>ideas out of those blogs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I was turning them into</v>

2743
02:19:22.571 --> 02:19:25.180
<v Speaker 4>bits,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the problem was people would be</v>

2744
02:19:25.181 --> 02:19:27.610
<v Speaker 4>upset though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well then this is sucking.</v>

2745
02:19:27.910 --> 02:19:30.020
<v Speaker 4>I've saw that it was in your blog and</v>
<v Speaker 4>will go,</v>

2746
02:19:30.021 --> 02:19:32.210
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well I have to make a decision here.</v>

2747
02:19:32.490 --> 02:19:36.350
<v Speaker 4>Either I keep doing the blogs and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>bits are in the blogs and people don't</v>

2748
02:19:36.351 --> 02:19:40.810
<v Speaker 4>mind or people get annoying and they</v>
<v Speaker 4>start complaining that the genesis of</v>

2749
02:19:40.811 --> 02:19:42.470
<v Speaker 4>the bits occurred in the box.</v>

2750
02:19:42.500 --> 02:19:45.170
<v Speaker 4>Guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was two guys that said that and it</v>

2751
02:19:45.171 --> 02:19:48.870
<v Speaker 4>gets in your fucking head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't know this,</v>

2752
02:19:49.280 --> 02:19:51.380
<v Speaker 4>but you know better if you think it</v>
<v Speaker 4>through,</v>

2753
02:19:51.410 --> 02:19:53.690
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>initially two guys,</v>

2754
02:19:53.810 --> 02:19:57.800
<v Speaker 4>I won't do two shows in a night because</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm afraid someone will stick around for</v>

2755
02:19:57.801 --> 02:20:02.240
<v Speaker 4>the second show and go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's a magic act will shit.</v>

2756
02:20:02.270 --> 02:20:03.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they will.</v>

2757
02:20:03.190 --> 02:20:05.600
<v Speaker 4>They will.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why I don't do two shows a night.</v>

2758
02:20:06.110 --> 02:20:06.950
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2759
02:20:06.951 --> 02:20:08.330
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could look at it that way,</v>

2760
02:20:08.331 --> 02:20:09.470
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2761
02:20:09.740 --> 02:20:14.000
<v Speaker 4>I've heard it said go take a post.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you piss on standing up?</v>

2762
02:20:14.090 --> 02:20:19.090
<v Speaker 4>I've heard it said that maybe it's not</v>
<v Speaker 4>bad if someone goes to the first show</v>

2763
02:20:19.730 --> 02:20:23.090
<v Speaker 4>and the second show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a few people in the audience actually</v>

2764
02:20:23.091 --> 02:20:26.690
<v Speaker 4>makes you think because those people</v>
<v Speaker 4>were there and you're aware of them.</v>

2765
02:20:26.900 --> 02:20:28.010
<v Speaker 4>You have to do it fresh.</v>

2766
02:20:28.220 --> 02:20:30.650
<v Speaker 4>You have to figure out a way to put a</v>
<v Speaker 4>new spin on it.</v>

2767
02:20:30.651 --> 02:20:35.450
<v Speaker 4>You have to figure out a way to present</v>
<v Speaker 4>it in a way that maybe it'll be exciting</v>

2768
02:20:35.451 --> 02:20:38.420
<v Speaker 4>for you and that way will be exciting</v>
<v Speaker 4>for them as well.</v>

2769
02:20:38.540 --> 02:20:41.480
<v Speaker 4>So in a way where instead of just</v>
<v Speaker 4>pressing play,</v>

2770
02:20:41.720 --> 02:20:44.690
<v Speaker 4>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even though this is something that I've</v>

2771
02:20:44.691 --> 02:20:48.740
<v Speaker 4>said multiple times over the course of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the last x amount of months that I've</v>

2772
02:20:48.741 --> 02:20:52.370
<v Speaker 4>been working on it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to say it in a new and</v>

2773
02:20:52.371 --> 02:20:55.850
<v Speaker 4>inspired way because I know these two</v>
<v Speaker 4>people from the first show going to be</v>

2774
02:20:55.851 --> 02:20:56.720
<v Speaker 4>here at the second show.</v>

2775
02:20:59.570 --> 02:21:04.570
<v Speaker 4>He wOn't tell me if there's people that</v>
<v Speaker 4>have stayed over town because he gets</v>

2776
02:21:04.990 --> 02:21:06.260
<v Speaker 4>old party.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2777
02:21:06.261 --> 02:21:08.210
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get my head.</v>

2778
02:21:08.211 --> 02:21:11.300
<v Speaker 4>I'll try to do completely different</v>
<v Speaker 4>material.</v>

2779
02:21:11.301 --> 02:21:13.820
<v Speaker 4>That's not even materials to care for</v>
<v Speaker 4>us.</v>

2780
02:21:13.860 --> 02:21:15.830
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because two fucking people.</v>

2781
02:21:16.010 --> 02:21:16.790
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2782
02:21:16.790 --> 02:21:19.360
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've shows the awkward people their</v>

2783
02:21:19.370 --> 02:21:20.660
<v Speaker 4>money back going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

2784
02:21:20.661 --> 02:21:23.390
<v Speaker 4>I saw you in manchester.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to come see him leads</v>

2785
02:21:23.391 --> 02:21:25.630
<v Speaker 4>tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll give you your money back right now.</v>

2786
02:21:25.700 --> 02:21:28.430
<v Speaker 4>Don't do that to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I told this dude and manchester,</v>

2787
02:21:28.670 --> 02:21:29.830
<v Speaker 4>if you're going to come.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>

2788
02:21:30.180 --> 02:21:32.000
<v Speaker 4>I'm coming to two shows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

2789
02:21:32.001 --> 02:21:33.890
<v Speaker 4>you got to get really fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The first show.</v>

2790
02:21:33.940 --> 02:21:38.420
<v Speaker 4>The second show is novel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't come to think about my</v>

2791
02:21:38.421 --> 02:21:41.600
<v Speaker 4>audience is most of them are drunks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they don't remember.</v>

2792
02:21:41.870 --> 02:21:44.090
<v Speaker 4>I get emails all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

2793
02:21:44.091 --> 02:21:47.120
<v Speaker 4>I hope that thing that specialists</v>
<v Speaker 4>coming up,</v>

2794
02:21:47.121 --> 02:21:50.410
<v Speaker 4>because I don't remember I was there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't remember a thing from it.</v>

2795
02:21:50.780 --> 02:21:52.940
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that potheads and alcoholics,</v>

2796
02:21:52.941 --> 02:21:57.000
<v Speaker 4>shane share that the lack of memory,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's this,</v>

2797
02:21:57.230 --> 02:21:59.600
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is what's beautiful about alcohol</v>

2798
02:21:59.601 --> 02:22:04.190
<v Speaker 4>as well as beautiful about pot is this</v>
<v Speaker 4>desire to somehow or another embrace</v>

2799
02:22:04.520 --> 02:22:07.520
<v Speaker 4>this moment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And with pot it's always the fear of</v>

2800
02:22:07.521 --> 02:22:12.521
<v Speaker 4>getting carried away by the new found</v>
<v Speaker 4>ideas of what reality really is.</v>

2801
02:22:14.540 --> 02:22:19.070
<v Speaker 4>Whereas with alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the ignorance of those ideas.</v>

2802
02:22:19.071 --> 02:22:21.650
<v Speaker 4>The point like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who fucking cares?</v>

2803
02:22:21.860 --> 02:22:26.280
<v Speaker 4>Who cares what we do in shots,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who've going to Mexico,</v>

2804
02:22:27.070 --> 02:22:29.550
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's where it comes in with alcohol.</v>

2805
02:22:29.610 --> 02:22:30.960
<v Speaker 4>Whereas his weed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2806
02:22:30.961 --> 02:22:32.820
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know how to get to the roof.</v>

2807
02:22:32.840 --> 02:22:35.370
<v Speaker 4>Let's go man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just like,</v>

2808
02:22:35.371 --> 02:22:38.400
<v Speaker 4>it's so weird to think that there's just</v>
<v Speaker 4>a few hundred miles.</v>

2809
02:22:38.401 --> 02:22:42.330
<v Speaker 4>There's fucking gas and like what does</v>
<v Speaker 4>it magnets or something like,</v>

2810
02:22:42.331 --> 02:22:43.920
<v Speaker 4>what's the magnetosphere?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

2811
02:22:43.921 --> 02:22:45.270
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let me get my phone.</v>

2812
02:22:45.420 --> 02:22:48.300
<v Speaker 4>And you're trying to figure out why the</v>
<v Speaker 4>earth.</v>

2813
02:22:48.330 --> 02:22:51.210
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't just absorb radiation from</v>
<v Speaker 4>the sun somehow or another.</v>

2814
02:22:51.211 --> 02:22:53.910
<v Speaker 4>It's been designed so there's like the</v>
<v Speaker 4>seal.</v>

2815
02:22:54.060 --> 02:22:56.580
<v Speaker 4>It's like circular shit that you don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>understand.</v>

2816
02:22:56.760 --> 02:23:01.260
<v Speaker 4>The magnetos fear and the honest fear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all fucking filtering gamma</v>

2817
02:23:01.261 --> 02:23:05.400
<v Speaker 4>radiation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That becomes your freak out instead of</v>

2818
02:23:05.401 --> 02:23:09.180
<v Speaker 4>the alcoholic freak out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is just a number.</v>

2819
02:23:09.280 --> 02:23:11.710
<v Speaker 4>Your jack and then I gotta get the fuck</v>

<v Speaker 4>That's where I'm going.</v>

2823

<v Speaker 4>This means you're going to do some</v>

<v Speaker 4>It was the worst parts about the job.</v>

<v Speaker 4>If you watch it on tv,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you don't have to try.</v>

3037
02:34:40.660 --> 02:34:42.370
<v Speaker 1>When I hear people doing the counseling</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>as long as you don't have to keep doing</v>

3041
02:34:48.671 --> 02:34:50.650
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the one of the problems that the</v>

3042
02:34:50.651 --> 02:34:54.020
<v Speaker 1>counseling is a lot of people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've done out.</v>

3043
02:34:54.500 --> 02:34:56.130
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3044
02:34:56.590 --> 02:35:00.760
<v Speaker 1>but I have on my life he had been like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>going into isolation tanks.</v>

3045
02:35:01.230 --> 02:35:05.810
<v Speaker 1>That's my own form of counseling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pot cookies or any sort of pot edible in</v>

3046
02:35:05.811 --> 02:35:10.811
<v Speaker 1>an isolation tank is so much more</v>
<v Speaker 1>intensely introspective than any,</v>

3047
02:35:12.340 --> 02:35:14.170
<v Speaker 1>any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any other person that you don't really</v>

3048
02:35:14.171 --> 02:35:15.400
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you know,</v>

3049
02:35:15.401 --> 02:35:16.690
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3050
02:35:16.780 --> 02:35:18.040
<v Speaker 1>you know you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you,</v>

3051
02:35:18.880 --> 02:35:23.880
<v Speaker 1>if you do like some real heavy dose of</v>
<v Speaker 1>edible marijuana in an isolation tank,</v>

3052
02:35:24.850 --> 02:35:29.850
<v Speaker 1>you get to look at yourself and like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>really weirdly introspective way.</v>

3053
02:35:30.850 --> 02:35:32.280
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3054
02:35:32.430 --> 02:35:36.700
<v Speaker 1>I think that's one of the things that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>so fun about alcohol because it frees</v>

3055
02:35:36.701 --> 02:35:41.701
<v Speaker 1>you from a lot of the nonsense that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>involved and introspective thought with</v>

3056
02:35:41.921 --> 02:35:44.460
<v Speaker 1>a finite lifespan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3057
02:35:44.660 --> 02:35:45.380
<v Speaker 1>because like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3058
02:35:45.380 --> 02:35:47.440
<v Speaker 1>well how much you can figure out pitch.</v>

3059
02:35:47.740 --> 02:35:50.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much you going to figure out you're</v>

3060
02:35:50.141 --> 02:35:55.141
<v Speaker 1>going to die no matter what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the freedom of that.</v>

3061
02:35:56.231 --> 02:36:01.231
<v Speaker 1>Alcohol sort of throws your way is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom of realization that sometimes</v>

3062
02:36:03.191 --> 02:36:08.191
<v Speaker 1>moments are critically important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are sometimes more important in the</v>

3063
02:36:09.761 --> 02:36:13.930
<v Speaker 1>future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same way you must enjoy the,</v>

3064
02:36:13.931 --> 02:36:18.931
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the theater of like smoking pot.</v>

3065
02:36:19.650 --> 02:36:22.630
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way you chop up lines,</v>

3066
02:36:22.631 --> 02:36:24.460
<v Speaker 1>you don't drink coke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ceremony.</v>

3067
02:36:24.940 --> 02:36:28.030
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chopping up lines and then finding a</v>

3068
02:36:28.031 --> 02:36:32.080
<v Speaker 1>straw and doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that with alcohol.</v>

3069
02:36:32.590 --> 02:36:37.590
<v Speaker 1>Like I carry my own cocktail straws</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I like a short glass with a</v>

3070
02:36:38.831 --> 02:36:43.520
<v Speaker 1>small cocktail straw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked the ceremony and uh,</v>

3071
02:36:44.200 --> 02:36:46.630
<v Speaker 1>there's something to that and then I get</v>
<v Speaker 1>drunk and go,</v>

3072
02:36:46.631 --> 02:36:47.980
<v Speaker 1>fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to drink off.</v>

3073
02:36:47.990 --> 02:36:50.560
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know my thoughts are on rogan's</v>

3074
02:36:50.630 --> 02:36:54.070
<v Speaker 1>bottle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Drink it straight to the ceremony.</v>

3075
02:36:54.160 --> 02:36:55.330
<v Speaker 1>I have thoughts on that.</v>

3076
02:36:55.650 --> 02:37:00.650
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever go to the place where he</v>
<v Speaker 1>grew up in a visit and you have like</v>

3077
02:37:00.790 --> 02:37:02.840
<v Speaker 1>this weird feeling like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

3078
02:37:03.030 --> 02:37:07.150
<v Speaker 1>I haven't been to the place where I live</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was in high school until I was</v>

3079
02:37:07.151 --> 02:37:12.151
<v Speaker 1>like 44 or 45 or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went back and when I went back for the</v>

3080
02:37:14.051 --> 02:37:16.130
<v Speaker 1>first time in all those years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was really bizarre.</v>

3081
02:37:16.131 --> 02:37:19.250
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's like an attachment of ideas that</v>

3082
02:37:19.251 --> 02:37:21.890
<v Speaker 1>I have to this place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3083
02:37:22.700 --> 02:37:26.350
<v Speaker 1>and I think that kind of carries on to</v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

3084
02:37:26.750 --> 02:37:28.250
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

3085
02:37:29.380 --> 02:37:34.380
<v Speaker 1>Having to write that book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>memories I have not shut out,</v>

3086
02:37:35.211 --> 02:37:39.140
<v Speaker 1>I just don't matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I had to go back to write that book</v>

3087
02:37:39.141 --> 02:37:43.580
<v Speaker 1>and I just remembering these things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>

3088
02:37:43.581 --> 02:37:44.414
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3089
02:37:44.780 --> 02:37:47.270
<v Speaker 1>that's that feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3090
02:37:47.990 --> 02:37:51.590
<v Speaker 1>Just when I had her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was doing that dumb run for</v>

3091
02:37:51.591 --> 02:37:56.591
<v Speaker 1>president and had to go back to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking high school to talk to people</v>

3092
02:37:56.601 --> 02:37:57.180
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

3093
02:37:57.180 --> 02:38:00.710
<v Speaker 1>It was a short lived,</v>
<v Speaker 1>funny idea that wasn't funny at all.</v>

3094
02:38:00.950 --> 02:38:05.950
<v Speaker 1>But walking into a high school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that fear was absolutely relevant in</v>

3095
02:38:08.091 --> 02:38:11.510
<v Speaker 1>2007.</v>
<v Speaker 1>LIke I was 19,</v>

3096
02:38:11.511 --> 02:38:13.160
<v Speaker 1>79.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3097
02:38:13.161 --> 02:38:17.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm terrified of being in a highschool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone's going to beat me up,</v>

3098
02:38:17.241 --> 02:38:21.500
<v Speaker 1>someone's going to pick on me was just</v>
<v Speaker 1>right there at the surface.</v>

3099
02:38:21.860 --> 02:38:26.570
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely a correlation.</v>

3100
02:38:27.230 --> 02:38:31.870
<v Speaker 1>I remember when you were doing the run</v>
<v Speaker 1>for president thing and you realized</v>

3101
02:38:32.120 --> 02:38:34.430
<v Speaker 1>early on there's no way you could do</v>
<v Speaker 1>standup.</v>

3102
02:38:36.100 --> 02:38:41.100
<v Speaker 1>That one has any money I made from</v>
<v Speaker 1>standup would be a donations to the and</v>

3103
02:38:43.491 --> 02:38:47.360
<v Speaker 1>then you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't do taxes when I do my taxes,</v>

3104
02:38:47.361 --> 02:38:52.361
<v Speaker 1>I just over pay on their behalf because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suck at math so bad that if you ever</v>

3105
02:38:54.021 --> 02:38:56.630
<v Speaker 1>audited me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you owe me money.</v>

3106
02:38:56.930 --> 02:38:59.900
<v Speaker 1>Does that make sense though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean why would I stink at it?</v>

3107
02:39:00.020 --> 02:39:01.010
<v Speaker 1>But what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would it.</v>

3108
02:39:01.070 --> 02:39:04.220
<v Speaker 1>Why would they be so terrified of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking publicly?</v>

3109
02:39:04.630 --> 02:39:05.720
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's what it is.</v>

3110
02:39:05.721 --> 02:39:08.210
<v Speaker 1>Like what is about your shows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you,</v>

3111
02:39:08.211 --> 02:39:10.790
<v Speaker 1>if you were a dentist and you're running</v>
<v Speaker 1>for president,</v>

3112
02:39:10.791 --> 02:39:13.040
<v Speaker 1>I would assume the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would still be able to work on</v>

3113
02:39:13.041 --> 02:39:13.940
<v Speaker 1>people's teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

3114
02:39:14.810 --> 02:39:19.220
<v Speaker 1>but as a public performer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you are going to be some sort of a</v>

3115
02:39:19.221 --> 02:39:21.770
<v Speaker 1>political figure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're going to have a voice on a</v>

3116
02:39:21.771 --> 02:39:23.810
<v Speaker 1>soap box in front of all these people</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a microphone.</v>

3117
02:39:24.110 --> 02:39:28.610
<v Speaker 1>You can't do anything else on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>microphone because it's kinda the same</v>

3118
02:39:28.611 --> 02:39:32.330
<v Speaker 1>thing and their eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something that's really similar</v>

3119
02:39:32.660 --> 02:39:36.980
<v Speaker 1>between someone doing a political</v>
<v Speaker 1>politician act and someone doing a</v>

3120
02:39:36.981 --> 02:39:39.230
<v Speaker 1>standup act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're almost interchangeable.</v>

3121
02:39:39.320 --> 02:39:41.720
<v Speaker 1>They're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're essentially admitting that it's</v>

3122
02:39:41.721 --> 02:39:44.150
<v Speaker 1>show business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no two drink minimum at a</v>

3123
02:39:44.151 --> 02:39:46.700
<v Speaker 1>fucking Donald Trump event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should be.</v>

3124
02:39:47.270 --> 02:39:49.910
<v Speaker 1>Should it be fucking awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Humanity.</v>

3125
02:39:50.610 --> 02:39:52.140
<v Speaker 1>Just wait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the countdown,</v>

3126
02:39:52.170 --> 02:39:53.600
<v Speaker 1>so someone screams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nigger</v>

3127
02:39:57.390 --> 02:40:00.190
<v Speaker 1>feeding them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Drake's just waiting.</v>

3128
02:40:00.650 --> 02:40:03.890
<v Speaker 1>Just waiting for someone to fucking pop</v>
<v Speaker 1>the n word views.</v>

3129
02:40:04.480 --> 02:40:08.810
<v Speaker 1>Just drunk enough to get a fucking giant</v>
<v Speaker 1>room full of trump supporters drunk</v>

3130
02:40:08.811 --> 02:40:11.390
<v Speaker 1>enough people say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3131
02:40:11.600 --> 02:40:13.860
<v Speaker 1>as a comic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't it be great if trump got</v>

3132
02:40:13.861 --> 02:40:16.230
<v Speaker 1>elected because your dad is so much</v>
<v Speaker 1>material?</v>

3133
02:40:16.290 --> 02:40:16.801
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3134
02:40:16.801 --> 02:40:20.400
<v Speaker 1>I'd have so much entertainment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go material.</v>

3135
02:40:20.610 --> 02:40:24.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comics who just find a news of the weird</v>

3136
02:40:24.211 --> 02:40:27.570
<v Speaker 1>article and just repeated on stage with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3137
02:40:27.571 --> 02:40:30.780
<v Speaker 1>the joke was already written in the news</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the weird article.</v>

3138
02:40:30.781 --> 02:40:34.710
<v Speaker 1>You need punchlines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump would be hilarious to me.</v>

3139
02:40:34.711 --> 02:40:38.040
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't use it as material because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's inherently funny.</v>

3140
02:40:38.041 --> 02:40:40.980
<v Speaker 1>Like a news of the weird article.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't make sense.</v>

3141
02:40:41.420 --> 02:40:43.470
<v Speaker 1>It is kind of right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how.</v>

3142
02:40:43.490 --> 02:40:46.530
<v Speaker 1>How much weirder is he than mitt romney?</v>

3143
02:40:46.680 --> 02:40:50.190
<v Speaker 1>Because if I have to choose between a</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy who's,</v>

3144
02:40:50.340 --> 02:40:54.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a part of some weird fucking ideology,</v>

3145
02:40:55.030 --> 02:40:55.591
<v Speaker 1>we.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3146
02:40:55.591 --> 02:41:00.591
<v Speaker 1>weird ideology or a guy who's just a</v>
<v Speaker 1>super ambitious reality star who also a</v>

3147
02:41:01.861 --> 02:41:04.620
<v Speaker 1>billionaire real estate developer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going with that guy.</v>

3148
02:41:04.621 --> 02:41:06.090
<v Speaker 1>Even if he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3149
02:41:06.540 --> 02:41:10.280
<v Speaker 1>he's for entertainment for himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

3150
02:41:11.890 --> 02:41:15.510
<v Speaker 1>but maybe not just he doesn't give a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck about you or the country,</v>

3151
02:41:15.511 --> 02:41:18.120
<v Speaker 1>but maybe he's entertaining.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe a little,</v>

3152
02:41:18.420 --> 02:41:21.450
<v Speaker 1>maybe a little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember when barack first get elected</v>

3153
02:41:21.451 --> 02:41:22.261
<v Speaker 1>and you thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3154
02:41:22.261 --> 02:41:25.980
<v Speaker 1>maybe he's over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things will really change in within</v>

3155
02:41:25.981 --> 02:41:26.790
<v Speaker 1>minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>

3156
02:41:26.790 --> 02:41:28.690
<v Speaker 1>nah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nah dude,</v>

3157
02:41:28.710 --> 02:41:31.590
<v Speaker 1>it was black people and white people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same.</v>

3158
02:41:31.620 --> 02:41:36.620
<v Speaker 1>It's just the amount of money they have</v>
<v Speaker 1>or why it was a.</v>

3159
02:41:36.990 --> 02:41:41.130
<v Speaker 1>It was a moment where I think I've kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of like for the first time I understood</v>

3160
02:41:41.131 --> 02:41:46.131
<v Speaker 1>that to be someone that gets into a</v>
<v Speaker 1>position like the president or something</v>

3161
02:41:47.341 --> 02:41:47.910
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

3162
02:41:47.910 --> 02:41:52.500
<v Speaker 1>The idea that that one person makes all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the calls for all the decisions that get</v>

3163
02:41:52.501 --> 02:41:56.610
<v Speaker 1>made about all the functions of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>government and education system and,</v>

3164
02:41:56.960 --> 02:41:58.260
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it is,</v>

3165
02:41:58.610 --> 02:42:01.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first responders and cops and</v>

3166
02:42:01.021 --> 02:42:02.400
<v Speaker 1>firefighters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no way.</v>

3167
02:42:02.550 --> 02:42:04.620
<v Speaker 1>There's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no way you can pin it on one</v>

3168
02:42:04.621 --> 02:42:05.910
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just can't do it.</v>

3169
02:42:05.911 --> 02:42:07.020
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

3170
02:42:07.590 --> 02:42:12.590
<v Speaker 1>It's an american one president that has</v>
<v Speaker 1>affected your life that your life</v>

3171
02:42:14.521 --> 02:42:17.550

<v Speaker 1>It's on netflix.</v>

3178
02:42:31.800 --> 02:42:35.130
<v Speaker 1>I haven't watched it yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get on it immediately.</v>

3179
02:42:35.210 --> 02:42:39.210
<v Speaker 1>You know why I haven't watched it yet</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think that I have things I</v>

3180
02:42:39.211 --> 02:42:42.570
<v Speaker 1>have to do and I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm putting off narcos until I have some</v>
<v Speaker 1>time off from the life I have that</v>

3182
02:42:49.170 --> 02:42:51.810
<v Speaker 1>sedentary anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I have a list.</v>

3183
02:42:51.990 --> 02:42:54.120
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Creating a mentor too drunk to be on</v>

3184
02:42:54.121 --> 02:42:57.270
<v Speaker 1>this podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make or have you gotten there yet?</v>

3185
02:42:57.460 --> 02:43:01.950
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have not watched this staircase,</v>

3186
02:43:02.490 --> 02:43:07.080
<v Speaker 1>watched that and then watch making a</v>
<v Speaker 1>murderer because making a murder of will</v>

3187
02:43:07.081 --> 02:43:12.081
<v Speaker 1>make you very upset for about 24 hours</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you in hindsight</v>

3188

<v Speaker 2>full access to the prosecution as well.</v>

3191
02:43:23.920 --> 02:43:28.920
<v Speaker 2>Making a murderer is completely biased.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to make you think that</v>

02:44:55.610 --> 02:44:56.450
<v Speaker 4>We've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're all right.</v>

3220
02:44:56.870 --> 02:44:58.530
<v Speaker 4>Hannigan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're in charge of this fucking ship,</v>

3221
02:44:58.550 --> 02:44:59.840
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a question for you.</v>

3222
02:44:59.841 --> 02:45:02.480
<v Speaker 4>joe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're evolve as a question for you.</v>

3223
02:45:02.520 --> 02:45:06.890
<v Speaker 4>Do you use two phrases of the year</v>
<v Speaker 4>phrases or did he come from somewhere?</v>

3224
02:45:06.910 --> 02:45:10.160
<v Speaker 4>I would say obsessive struggle and</v>
<v Speaker 4>mental mortgage.</v>

3225
02:45:10.580 --> 02:45:12.130
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>

3226
02:45:12.250 --> 02:45:14.330
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I can claim either one of</v>
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>

3227
02:45:14.331 --> 02:45:17.030
<v Speaker 4>but obsessive struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I am.</v>

3228
02:45:17.270 --> 02:45:19.310
<v Speaker 4>The first time I said it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think was just.</v>

3229
02:45:19.311 --> 02:45:21.170
<v Speaker 4>Then I don't believe I've said that</v>
<v Speaker 4>before,</v>

3230
02:45:21.380 --> 02:45:26.380
<v Speaker 4>but the idea is</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone at it throwing someone at a</v>

3231
02:45:29.741 --> 02:45:34.741
<v Speaker 4>swing and careful about how we express</v>
<v Speaker 4>our opinion about this amy schumer thing</v>

3232
02:45:35.991 --> 02:45:39.080
<v Speaker 4>without being completely serious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

3233
02:45:39.200 --> 02:45:42.440
<v Speaker 4>It's another podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm too drunk to defend my.</v>

3234
02:45:42.990 --> 02:45:47.990
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to jeopardize</v>
<v Speaker 4>the only like you live here.</v>

3235
02:45:49.670 --> 02:45:52.370
<v Speaker 4>I don't live around comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have more knowledge.</v>

3236
02:45:52.430 --> 02:45:56.660
<v Speaker 4>I would defend amy schumer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but with blanks because I don't know.</v>

3237
02:45:56.740 --> 02:45:58.130
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know either,</v>

3238
02:45:58.430 --> 02:46:02.710
<v Speaker 4>but I do know the w.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's been proven is that the real</v>

3239
02:46:02.720 --> 02:46:06.980
<v Speaker 4>agregious ones that people believe are</v>
<v Speaker 4>an issue were written by other people</v>

3240
02:46:07.340 --> 02:46:10.180
<v Speaker 4>written by writers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a.</v>

3241
02:46:10.550 --> 02:46:15.320
<v Speaker 1>That's why I was going to use schumer</v>
<v Speaker 1>who I know nothing about other than I</v>

3242
02:46:15.321 --> 02:46:19.010
<v Speaker 1>laughed at or special,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there were times where bill maher</v>

3243
02:46:19.670 --> 02:46:20.990
<v Speaker 1>did shit where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yo,</v>

3244
02:46:21.380 --> 02:46:24.410
<v Speaker 1>that's fucking mine because I'm a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3245
02:46:25.250 --> 02:46:29.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's not a pedestrian</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking comic and I would blame the</v>

3246
02:46:29.181 --> 02:46:32.270
<v Speaker 1>writers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't care because they can write</v>

3247
02:46:32.271 --> 02:46:33.530
<v Speaker 1>other shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3248
02:46:33.531 --> 02:46:37.550
<v Speaker 1>there was a time where they kicked</v>
<v Speaker 1>writers of the back of the comedy store</v>

3249
02:46:37.760 --> 02:46:38.450
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3250
02:46:38.450 --> 02:46:43.310
<v Speaker 1>they were writing for a sketch show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were going on stage,</v>

3251
02:46:43.490 --> 02:46:47.480
<v Speaker 1>these comics going onstage and coming up</v>
<v Speaker 1>with these funny premises that would</v>

3252
02:46:47.481 --> 02:46:49.520
<v Speaker 1>wind up on these television sketch</v>
<v Speaker 1>shows,</v>

3253
02:46:49.850 --> 02:46:54.320
<v Speaker 1>it wanting to be acted out in a sketch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the people that were the writers of</v>

3254
02:46:54.321 --> 02:46:57.440
<v Speaker 1>the sketch show would go to the comedy</v>
<v Speaker 1>store and sit in the back room and they</v>

3255
02:46:57.441 --> 02:46:58.130
<v Speaker 1>got kicked out.</v>

3256
02:46:58.130 --> 02:46:59.120
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3257
02:46:59.180 --> 02:47:01.130
<v Speaker 1>And they got kicked out because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>

3258
02:47:01.280 --> 02:47:03.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was in the nineties,</v>

3259
02:47:03.150 --> 02:47:05.120
<v Speaker 1>ish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could get away with doing that kind</v>

3260
02:47:05.121 --> 02:47:06.520
<v Speaker 1>of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

3261
02:47:06.660 --> 02:47:09.860
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like to put it all on her</v>

3262
02:47:09.861 --> 02:47:10.820
<v Speaker 1>shoulders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His work.</v>

3263
02:47:10.821 --> 02:47:12.050
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

3264
02:47:12.051 --> 02:47:16.070
<v Speaker 1>who the fuck knows who's writing those</v>
<v Speaker 1>sketches?</v>

3265
02:47:16.370 --> 02:47:18.170
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows what's writing those things.</v>

3266
02:47:18.200 --> 02:47:20.570
<v Speaker 1>The point is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if she's already said it,</v>

3267
02:47:21.440 --> 02:47:23.810
<v Speaker 1>then it should be done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If she said it publicly,</v>

3268
02:47:23.990 --> 02:47:25.820
<v Speaker 1>if you're in the back of the comedy</v>
<v Speaker 1>store,</v>

3269
02:47:25.821 --> 02:47:30.821
<v Speaker 1>when someone's working out some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had several people do shit that I</v>

3270
02:47:33.381 --> 02:47:38.381
<v Speaker 1>already put out on dvd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them became famous because of one</v>

3271
02:47:38.631 --> 02:47:42.410
<v Speaker 1>of a kevin booths,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3272
02:47:42.440 --> 02:47:43.250
<v Speaker 1>word of mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

3273
02:47:43.250 --> 02:47:47.510
<v Speaker 1>and he's admitted to me that he stole</v>
<v Speaker 1>that bit and that's what made it.</v>

3274
02:47:47.690 --> 02:47:50.300
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I stopped doing that because I put it on</v>

3275
02:47:50.301 --> 02:47:54.170
<v Speaker 1>a dvd and he's a nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got some problems,</v>

3276
02:47:54.560 --> 02:47:57.950
<v Speaker 1>but I don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got real problems in life.</v>

3277
02:47:58.800 --> 02:48:00.640
<v Speaker 1>It's just become.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

3278
02:48:00.641 --> 02:48:03.470
<v Speaker 1>it's not like saying like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone comes up with somebody else's</v>

3279
02:48:03.471 --> 02:48:05.030
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could never come up with their own</v>

3280
02:48:05.600 --> 02:48:07.460
<v Speaker 1>because you still can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

3281
02:48:09.080 --> 02:48:13.190
<v Speaker 1>you're way better off just trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>come up with all your own ideas.</v>

3282
02:48:13.220 --> 02:48:18.220
<v Speaker 1>If you came out with a story about a</v>
<v Speaker 1>euthanizing your own mother or attending</v>

3283
02:48:19.671 --> 02:48:22.150
<v Speaker 1>that euthanization like yerba.</v>

3284
02:48:26.060 --> 02:48:28.370
<v Speaker 1>I already put it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck.</v>

3285
02:48:28.790 --> 02:48:31.310
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only way someone would ever be able</v>

3286
02:48:31.311 --> 02:48:36.311
<v Speaker 1>to get away with it is if it was their</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience and they acknowledged that</v>

3287
02:48:38.121 --> 02:48:40.460
<v Speaker 1>they had heard of your experience as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

3288
02:48:41.120 --> 02:48:46.120
<v Speaker 1>Like if someone becAme famous because of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and</v>

3289
02:48:48.290 --> 02:48:51.800
<v Speaker 1>you're going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if some open mic or tried to do it,</v>

3290
02:48:51.810 --> 02:48:54.920
<v Speaker 1>who are going to be fucking called out</v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually fuck you.</v>

3291
02:48:54.921 --> 02:48:57.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm my life moves on.</v>

3292
02:48:57.651 --> 02:49:00.650
<v Speaker 1>I have real problems in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But let me ask you this because that's</v>

3293
02:49:00.651 --> 02:49:03.070
<v Speaker 1>an intensely personal thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If a,</v>

3294
02:49:03.071 --> 02:49:07.950
<v Speaker 1>an open mic or say really did have an</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience where his mother</v>

3295
02:49:08.130 --> 02:49:13.130
<v Speaker 4>wanted him to help her commit suicide</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he went through with it and she died</v>

3296
02:49:14.070 --> 02:49:19.070
<v Speaker 4>and he decided to do a bit about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But acknowledging that he had seen your</v>

3297
02:49:21.871 --> 02:49:26.420
<v Speaker 4>bit as well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like not not going through with it.</v>

3298
02:49:26.430 --> 02:49:26.661
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3299
02:49:26.661 --> 02:49:30.090
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't acknowledged me at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well I think you should.</v>

3300
02:49:30.150 --> 02:49:34.410
<v Speaker 4>If someone stole that blatantly from me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a different story.</v>

3301
02:49:34.440 --> 02:49:37.590
<v Speaker 4>But eliminate fuck because I have real</v>
<v Speaker 4>problem.</v>

3302
02:49:37.600 --> 02:49:40.990
<v Speaker 4>But to eliminate doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if a guy only has on stage an hour,</v>

3303
02:49:41.130 --> 02:49:41.990
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

3304
02:49:42.330 --> 02:49:45.330
<v Speaker 4>you don't want anybody in a state of</v>
<v Speaker 4>confusion going,</v>

3305
02:49:46.050 --> 02:49:48.570
<v Speaker 4>doug stanhope just joke about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3306
02:49:48.660 --> 02:49:51.480
<v Speaker 4>putting his mother to death.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to address that because that's</v>

3307
02:49:51.481 --> 02:49:54.200
<v Speaker 4>a big joke that you have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's like it's,</v>

3308
02:49:54.201 --> 02:49:58.170
<v Speaker 4>it's really like well respected and</v>
<v Speaker 4>enjoyed.</v>

3309
02:49:58.200 --> 02:50:00.840
<v Speaker 4>Joke,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so if someone was a doug stanhope fan</v>

3310
02:50:01.140 --> 02:50:05.310
<v Speaker 4>and they came to see this new dude and</v>
<v Speaker 4>this new dude really did have to help</v>

3311
02:50:05.311 --> 02:50:06.570
<v Speaker 4>his mom killed herself.</v>

3312
02:50:06.750 --> 02:50:07.583
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

3313
02:50:07.630 --> 02:50:08.580
<v Speaker 4>and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3314
02:50:08.880 --> 02:50:11.400
<v Speaker 4>I just have to say before I talked to</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

3315
02:50:11.540 --> 02:50:14.700
<v Speaker 4>I've talked about this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like one of my favorite comedians,</v>

3316
02:50:14.701 --> 02:50:19.410
<v Speaker 4>doug stan hope or a guy I think is</v>
<v Speaker 4>fairly mediocre but extremely exciting.</v>

3317
02:50:19.590 --> 02:50:21.750
<v Speaker 4>Like whatever description he has for</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

3318
02:50:22.190 --> 02:50:24.870
<v Speaker 4>he should have to admit I'm a doug stand</v>
<v Speaker 4>hold fan.</v>

3319
02:50:24.871 --> 02:50:27.380
<v Speaker 4>I've listened to his comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he's great and I,</v>

3320
02:50:27.381 --> 02:50:29.550
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't believe this was happening to</v>

3321
02:50:29.551 --> 02:50:32.340
<v Speaker 4>me as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like then he's talking about his own</v>

3322
02:50:32.341 --> 02:50:35.820
<v Speaker 4>life experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you can't eliminate a person's life</v>

3323
02:50:35.821 --> 02:50:40.821
<v Speaker 4>experience from the right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think you like to make it easier</v>

3324
02:50:40.861 --> 02:50:43.620
<v Speaker 4>for everybody listening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They should probably knowledge.</v>

3325
02:50:43.830 --> 02:50:47.160
<v Speaker 4>Like if someone did have to help their</v>
<v Speaker 4>mom committed suicide,</v>

3326
02:50:47.161 --> 02:50:51.420
<v Speaker 4>they should have to say in some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 4>a way if they shouldn't have to,</v>

3327
02:50:51.421 --> 02:50:53.580
<v Speaker 4>but it would be smart to say I've done</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

3328
02:50:53.580 --> 02:50:57.840
<v Speaker 4>Where I go is like so and so said.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3329
02:50:57.870 --> 02:50:59.490
<v Speaker 4>but this happened to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3330
02:51:00.240 --> 02:51:04.470
<v Speaker 4>Know it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A question with a question would be like</v>

3331
02:51:04.710 --> 02:51:07.290
<v Speaker 4>going back to something jo said earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was,</v>

3332
02:51:07.500 --> 02:51:12.500
<v Speaker 4>what if that person is chris rock who's</v>
<v Speaker 4>like so much bigger and nobody knows who</v>

3333
02:51:13.741 --> 02:51:17.100
<v Speaker 4>the fuck you are?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then you as joe rogan to step in and go,</v>

3334
02:51:17.220 --> 02:51:20.040
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry carlos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but are we already did that</v>

3335
02:51:21.660 --> 02:51:25.000
<v Speaker 4>and then you crush.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's not a whole lot of guys that are</v>

3336
02:51:25.040 --> 02:51:30.030
<v Speaker 4>little spot where his career,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I don't know if it's because you</v>

3337
02:51:30.031 --> 02:51:35.031
<v Speaker 4>deflated his ego so much or his</v>
<v Speaker 4>confidence or the people spoke out,</v>

3338
02:51:37.440 --> 02:51:42.440
<v Speaker 4>but after that incident he disappeared.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He went down to my level where if we're</v>

3339
02:51:43.921 --> 02:51:48.810
<v Speaker 4>doing a wednesday at the cleveland</v>
<v Speaker 4>improv one show only,</v>

3340
02:51:48.811 --> 02:51:53.811
<v Speaker 4>he's doing a thursday or vice versa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but honestly that is not a bad thing.</v>

3341
02:51:55.200 --> 02:52:00.200
<v Speaker 4>Like what his life is is really good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If he's headlined in these really nice</v>

3342
02:52:00.391 --> 02:52:03.840
<v Speaker 4>clubs all over the country,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's not like in a bad place.</v>

3343
02:52:04.260 --> 02:52:06.010
<v Speaker 4>You know what happened?</v>

3344
02:52:06.010 --> 02:52:11.010
<v Speaker 3>There was all judgment aside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What a.</v>

3345
02:52:11.980 --> 02:52:16.340
<v Speaker 3>There was like a blip in the matrix.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a problem with the,</v>

3346
02:52:16.341 --> 02:52:19.960
<v Speaker 3>the the operating system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a reaL issue with how things</v>

3347
02:52:19.961 --> 02:52:24.940
<v Speaker 3>were going and guys like all of us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody that was watching it was going,</v>

3348
02:52:24.941 --> 02:52:26.900
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are being being fucking</v>

3349
02:52:27.130 --> 02:52:29.110
<v Speaker 3>victimized here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we had a real problem here,</v>

3350
02:52:29.320 --> 02:52:31.360
<v Speaker 3>like someone's taken.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't even taken from me.</v>

3351
02:52:31.630 --> 02:52:34.840
<v Speaker 3>he wasn't taken from you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was some weird parasitic</v>

3352
02:52:34.841 --> 02:52:38.800
<v Speaker 3>situation that had been accepted into</v>
<v Speaker 3>the community because of sort of,</v>

3353
02:52:39.400 --> 02:52:42.070
<v Speaker 3>I don't like the term reverse racism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's some,</v>

3354
02:52:42.160 --> 02:52:47.160
<v Speaker 3>some weird thing about choosing to like</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretend that some guys mexican is</v>

3355
02:52:47.530 --> 02:52:51.520
<v Speaker 3>because you think there's a market for</v>
<v Speaker 3>mexicans and this guy goes in there and</v>

3356
02:52:51.521 --> 02:52:54.820
<v Speaker 3>start stealing people's bits and</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody accepts everything and then</v>

3357
02:52:54.830 --> 02:52:56.920
<v Speaker 3>the artists are sitting back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sitting back on,</v>

3358
02:52:56.921 --> 02:52:59.830
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you guys have found some weird</v>

3359
02:53:00.610 --> 02:53:04.170
<v Speaker 3>vein,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some weird river of revenue and the</v>

3360
02:53:04.230 --> 02:53:06.460
<v Speaker 3>attention,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and in this river of revenue and</v>

3361
02:53:06.461 --> 02:53:08.200
<v Speaker 3>attention,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to have a specific sort of</v>

3362
02:53:08.290 --> 02:53:10.710
<v Speaker 3>stereotypical ethnicity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3363
02:53:10.910 --> 02:53:13.830
<v Speaker 3>so let's change your layout.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3364
02:53:14.580 --> 02:53:19.580
<v Speaker 2>but that's exactly where you should not</v>
<v Speaker 2>give a fuck because those are not the</v>

3365
02:53:20.161 --> 02:53:23.670
<v Speaker 2>people you want to talk to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The the whole idea that,</v>

3366
02:53:23.880 --> 02:53:24.713
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3367
02:53:24.750 --> 02:53:28.050
<v Speaker 2>he only likes them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I always hate the audience</v>

3368
02:53:28.051 --> 02:53:31.400
<v Speaker 2>instead of the artists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you can fucking have you,</v>

3369
02:53:31.620 --> 02:53:35.210
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to be a televangelist</v>
<v Speaker 2>and make a lot of people clap.</v>

3370

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to hate you,</v>

3371
02:53:37.500 --> 02:53:39.800

<v Speaker 2>I can't hate you too much because you</v>

<v Speaker 2>they don't give a fuck.</v>

3382
02:54:13.820 --> 02:54:16.050
<v Speaker 2>That's not the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the body issue.</v>

3383
02:54:16.750 --> 02:54:18.010
<v Speaker 2>The problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

3384
02:54:18.030 --> 02:54:20.640
<v Speaker 2>People didn't feel like they could go on</v>

3385
02:54:20.810 --> 02:54:24.770
<v Speaker 3>stage in front of him if they weren't</v>
<v Speaker 3>famous because he would do their stuff</v>

3386
02:54:24.771 --> 02:54:28.040
<v Speaker 3>on comedy central and then this stuff</v>
<v Speaker 3>would no longer be their stuff because</v>

3387
02:54:28.041 --> 02:54:29.190
<v Speaker 3>if a guy's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3388
02:54:29.230 --> 02:54:32.750
<v Speaker 3>lupe fiasco and he's going up fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>thursday night at the comedy store.</v>

3389
02:54:32.920 --> 02:54:34.340
<v Speaker 2>Dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm tired.</v>

3390
02:54:35.050 --> 02:54:40.050
<v Speaker 2>I've been in the loop for awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a million channels between</v>

3391
02:54:40.260 --> 02:54:45.260
<v Speaker 2>the internet and tv and everything so I</v>
<v Speaker 2>could actually steal people's material</v>

3392
02:54:47.250 --> 02:54:52.250
<v Speaker 2>and they would never know because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's such a broad spectrum.</v>

3393
02:54:53.430 --> 02:54:55.770
<v Speaker 2>Not ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not for channels.</v>

3394
02:54:55.771 --> 02:55:00.771
<v Speaker 2>Like when we were kids and oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said that on Johnny Carson last</v>

3395
02:55:00.990 --> 02:55:04.710
<v Speaker 2>night.</v>

<v Speaker 1>bit on one of his cds.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That was one of my bits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know we didn't steal it and then I had</v>

3398
02:55:14.961 --> 02:55:19.010
<v Speaker 1>one a bit silly and I called him up and</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

02:55:38.661 --> 02:55:41.330
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely a case of parallel</v>

3405
02:55:41.331 --> 02:55:43.220
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you would always know that if you</v>

3406
02:55:43.221 --> 02:55:47.090
<v Speaker 1>know fitzsimmons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you felt very comfortable in</v>

3407
02:55:47.091 --> 02:55:50.900
<v Speaker 1>doing that bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even after I heard fitzsimmons do it on</v>

3408

<v Speaker 1>Comedy is used to be a very small</v>

3412
02:56:03.561 --> 02:56:04.394
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>

3413

3415
02:56:10.041 --> 02:56:12.000

<v Speaker 1>he'll,</v>

3416
02:56:12.020 --> 02:56:13.940
<v Speaker 1>he'll be 100 percent real with you.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It'd be like breathing underwater.</v>

3421
02:56:24.050 --> 02:56:26.060
<v Speaker 1>Like he's never going to be a thief.</v>

<v Speaker 3>racetrack?</v>

3478
02:59:32.390 --> 02:59:34.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some guy got out of his car.</v>

3479
02:59:34.740 --> 02:59:38.550
<v Speaker 3>Tony stewart hit him with his car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so crazy to watch,</v>

3480
02:59:39.000 --> 02:59:42.360
<v Speaker 3>but I remember thinking like that guy in</v>
<v Speaker 3>nascar,</v>

3481
02:59:42.420 --> 02:59:44.580
<v Speaker 3>like that's nascar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that tony's tour guy.</v>

3482
02:59:44.820 --> 02:59:48.690
<v Speaker 3>That guy drives on the dirt too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you drive on the dirt and like a</v>

3483
02:59:48.691 --> 02:59:51.420
<v Speaker 3>dune buggy and the people he drives</v>
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

3484
02:59:51.421 --> 02:59:53.430
<v Speaker 3>they get mad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They get out of their fucking car and</v>

3485
02:59:53.431 --> 02:59:58.431
<v Speaker 3>you run them over like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What they get out of their fucking car.</v>

3486
02:59:58.530 --> 03:00:02.190
<v Speaker 3>Could you imagine someone in nascar got</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of their fucking car?</v>

3487
03:00:02.880 --> 03:00:05.460
<v Speaker 3>How fast those guys going?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea.</v>

3488
03:00:05.590 --> 03:00:07.250
<v Speaker 3>Injured 200 miles an hour.</v>

3489
03:00:10.740 --> 03:00:12.060
<v Speaker 3>But that's how I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same thing,</v>

3490
03:00:12.061 --> 03:00:12.894
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3491
03:00:12.930 --> 03:00:15.320
<v Speaker 3>Kind of the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's the idea that you'd get her</v>

3492
03:00:15.410 --> 03:00:17.580
<v Speaker 3>standing in the way of a car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was bizarre.</v>

3493
03:00:17.581 --> 03:00:22.581
<v Speaker 3>The guy got out and stood there I think</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the tony stewart guy's car hit</v>

3494
03:00:23.551 --> 03:00:27.330
<v Speaker 3>his car and so he got out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh jesus.</v>

3495
03:00:27.331 --> 03:00:29.160
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why don't you make us watch that dude</v>

3496
03:00:29.161 --> 03:00:33.150
<v Speaker 3>cut tumbled under that car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh god.</v>

3497
03:00:33.151 --> 03:00:36.090
<v Speaker 3>That's so awful there for them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's so awful.</v>

3498
03:00:36.120 --> 03:00:37.380
<v Speaker 3>So he did that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

3499
03:00:37.381 --> 03:00:39.000
<v Speaker 3>he's dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That guy's dead.</v>

3500
03:00:39.170 --> 03:00:41.980
<v Speaker 3>And his whole family was upset and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>blamed,</v>

3501
03:00:41.981 --> 03:00:46.981
<v Speaker 3>really upset because he was killed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They dreamed it blamed on the driver.</v>

3502
03:00:48.450 --> 03:00:50.610
<v Speaker 3>I don't know enough about driving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

3503
03:00:50.640 --> 03:00:53.970
<v Speaker 3>I don't know enough about driving to</v>
<v Speaker 3>determine whether or not</v>

3504
03:00:54.070 --> 03:00:57.210
<v Speaker 2>he can drive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm fine.</v>

3505
03:00:58.720 --> 03:01:00.080
<v Speaker 2>I know I know enough about</v>

3506
03:01:00.100 --> 03:01:02.860
<v Speaker 1>lawyers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

3507
03:01:02.861 --> 03:01:05.890
<v Speaker 1>but how does one make the distinction</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not he's at fault?</v>

3508
03:01:06.970 --> 03:01:08.590
<v Speaker 1>That's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a tricky distinction,</v>

3509
03:01:08.591 --> 03:01:10.720
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that guy just standing out there</v>

3510
03:01:10.721 --> 03:01:12.670
<v Speaker 1>in the middle of the track.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

3511
03:01:13.000 --> 03:01:18.000
<v Speaker 1>Watching footbaLl yesterday where we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching fucking helmet to helmet</v>

3512
03:01:18.041 --> 03:01:19.160
<v Speaker 1>contact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

3513
03:01:19.600 --> 03:01:23.470
<v Speaker 1>That's assault and battery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like intent to fuck.</v>

3514
03:01:23.590 --> 03:01:27.550
<v Speaker 1>That's attempted murder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically your maiming people in a way.</v>

3515
03:01:27.640 --> 03:01:29.050
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're smashing people.</v>

3516
03:01:29.170 --> 03:01:32.050
<v Speaker 1>If I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I headbutted some dude in a bar,</v>

3517
03:01:32.051 --> 03:01:36.130
<v Speaker 1>could could I get a 15 yard penalty and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it,</v>

3518
03:01:36.250 --> 03:01:40.300
<v Speaker 1>but here's the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you totally 100 percent be</v>

3519
03:01:40.320 --> 03:01:45.320
<v Speaker 1>responsible for head on head collisions</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you didn't intend them to be a head</v>

3520
03:01:45.551 --> 03:01:49.360
<v Speaker 1>on head collision and you're running</v>
<v Speaker 1>full clip towards some guy who's trying</v>

3521
03:01:49.361 --> 03:01:52.150
<v Speaker 1>to not have you tackle him like some</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy shit happens,</v>

3522
03:01:52.151 --> 03:01:53.860
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you have to take that into</v>

3523
03:01:53.861 --> 03:01:55.250
<v Speaker 1>consideration funnel.</v>

3524
03:01:55.380 --> 03:01:59.380
<v Speaker 1>What would it not completely go to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>criminal element where you go,</v>

3525
03:02:00.220 --> 03:02:04.170
<v Speaker 1>if it was against the law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it was against the rules and it was a</v>

3526
03:02:04.180 --> 03:02:08.280
<v Speaker 1>hockey brush,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shira thing where you got fucking wacky</v>

3527
03:02:08.380 --> 03:02:11.200
<v Speaker 1>with a stick and the guy did time</v>
<v Speaker 1>horrific.</v>

3528
03:02:11.260 --> 03:02:13.660
<v Speaker 1>That was horrific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See hockey's a problem.</v>

3529
03:02:14.320 --> 03:02:16.990
<v Speaker 1>and here's one of the problems with</v>
<v Speaker 1>hockey.</v>

3530
03:02:17.210 --> 03:02:18.940
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's awesome.</v>

3531
03:02:19.150 --> 03:02:21.460
<v Speaker 1>That's one problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the reasons why it's awesome</v>

3532
03:02:21.461 --> 03:02:23.310
<v Speaker 1>as they let them fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh no,</v>

3533
03:02:23.320 --> 03:02:28.090
<v Speaker 1>it's awesome because of hd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now when you have 60 inches high</v>

3534
03:02:28.091 --> 03:02:31.090
<v Speaker 1>definition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can watch this fucking sport and</v>

3535
03:02:31.091 --> 03:02:31.924
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>love it.</v>

3536
03:02:32.260 --> 03:02:33.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love hockey too,</v>

3537
03:02:33.431 --> 03:02:34.930
<v Speaker 1>for the same reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love music.</v>

3538
03:02:34.990 --> 03:02:37.330
<v Speaker 1>So I have zero fucking talent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't even skate.</v>

3539
03:02:37.720 --> 03:02:39.760
<v Speaker 1>If I got on skates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll fall flat on my ass.</v>

3540
03:02:39.761 --> 03:02:41.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm just retarded.</v>

3572
03:04:03.570 --> 03:04:04.880

<v Speaker 2>I took,</v>

3573
03:04:04.890 --> 03:04:09.890
<v Speaker 2>I add an hour's worth of shit that</v>
<v Speaker 2>either I hadn't done on tape or get cut</v>

3574
03:04:11.031 --> 03:04:16.031
<v Speaker 2>out of other specials to make it an hour</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I got it while we're filming here.</v>

3575
03:04:16.851 --> 03:04:19.790
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have a crew that's film one right in</v>

3576
03:04:19.791 --> 03:04:24.170
<v Speaker 2>the house at the funhouse going put 35</v>
<v Speaker 2>people tightly packed</v>

3577
03:04:25.880 --> 03:04:29.540
<v Speaker 2>and it fucking killed except when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>see the footage.</v>

3578
03:04:29.750 --> 03:04:34.750
<v Speaker 2>It was too brightly lit and that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>could do the reverse sweatshirts on the</v>

3579
03:04:36.891 --> 03:04:39.920
<v Speaker 2>internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you could use a negative filter,</v>

3580
03:04:40.070 --> 03:04:43.070
<v Speaker 2>so filter that makes it look like more</v>
<v Speaker 2>gloomy.</v>

3581
03:04:43.190 --> 03:04:47.690
<v Speaker 2>like maybe I</v>
<v Speaker 2>should try to make it gloomy.</v>

3582
03:04:47.840 --> 03:04:48.621
<v Speaker 2>Don't worry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'll be fake.</v>

<v Speaker 2>live.</v>

3618
03:06:35.730 --> 03:06:40.730
<v Speaker 2>When we do podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people are drinking and they</v>

3623
03:06:53.960 --> 03:06:56.160
<v Speaker 2>it should be a swap cast where you both</v>

3624
03:06:56.160 --> 03:06:57.840
<v Speaker 4>put it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Two birds.</v>

3625
03:06:57.841 --> 03:06:58.674
<v Speaker 4>One stone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3626
03:06:58.680 --> 03:07:00.210
<v Speaker 4>That's a good move.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3627
03:07:00.510 --> 03:07:03.720
<v Speaker 4>and I've been pitching this since I've</v>
<v Speaker 4>been doing it.</v>

3628
03:07:03.750 --> 03:07:05.190
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could take this one if you want.</v>

3629
03:07:05.370 --> 03:07:06.970
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's probably some content going.</v>

3630
03:07:07.030 --> 03:07:08.550
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stan hope already did it.</v>

3631
03:07:08.551 --> 03:07:10.860
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm saying you should steal that idea.</v>

3632
03:07:11.310 --> 03:07:14.040
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that a can't do it with you.</v>

3633
03:07:14.090 --> 03:07:14.580
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whoa.</v>

3634
03:07:14.580 --> 03:07:17.020
<v Speaker 4>We definitely could do it with me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could definitely take.</v>

3635
03:07:17.030 --> 03:07:18.930
<v Speaker 4>We'll give you a copy of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that,</v>

3636
03:07:18.990 --> 03:07:22.200
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think regardless of how many people</v>

3637
03:07:22.201 --> 03:07:24.900
<v Speaker 4>are listening,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's 10 or a million or 10</v>

3638
03:07:24.900 --> 03:07:25.733
<v Speaker 4>million,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who gives a shit,</v>

3639
03:07:26.820 --> 03:07:28.730
<v Speaker 4>it should.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody was just sort of like</v>

3640
03:07:28.770 --> 03:07:30.240
<v Speaker 4>distributed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3641
03:07:30.570 --> 03:07:32.790
<v Speaker 4>the whole.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The beautiful thing about podcasts is</v>

3642
03:07:32.791 --> 03:07:35.130
<v Speaker 4>that everybody can get them for four</v>
<v Speaker 4>days and it doesn't,</v>

3643
03:07:35.131 --> 03:07:40.050
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't hurt me to give you the copy</v>
<v Speaker 4>of our show.</v>

3644
03:07:40.260 --> 03:07:41.550
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it shouldn't hurt you.</v>

3645
03:07:41.550 --> 03:07:43.680
<v Speaker 4>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's all I want.</v>

3646
03:07:44.010 --> 03:07:45.900
<v Speaker 4>I want people to listen to your show</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I listened to it.</v>

3647
03:07:46.160 --> 03:07:51.160
<v Speaker 4>Like there's plenty of that creeped me</v>
<v Speaker 4>out whether I listened that you had the</v>

3648
03:07:51.571 --> 03:07:55.440
<v Speaker 4>time to listen to a podcast that degas</v>
<v Speaker 4>shit out,</v>

3649
03:07:55.441 --> 03:07:56.580
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got time.</v>

3650
03:07:56.581 --> 03:07:59.190
<v Speaker 4>I just don't waste it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get sHit done.</v>

3651
03:07:59.191 --> 03:08:02.100
<v Speaker 4>I know that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I realized if I didn't drink,</v>

3652
03:08:02.101 --> 03:08:06.420
<v Speaker 4>I'd have eight more hours in every day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have sat in the fun house in bisbee</v>

3653
03:08:06.421 --> 03:08:10.980
<v Speaker 4>and look at god and like look to joe</v>
<v Speaker 4>rogan's activity on a spreadsheet and</v>

3654
03:08:10.981 --> 03:08:13.110
<v Speaker 4>try to work out when it is your</v>
<v Speaker 4>sleeping.</v>

3655
03:08:13.640 --> 03:08:15.240
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're like high on a minute.</v>

3656
03:08:15.270 --> 03:08:17.610
<v Speaker 4>He's doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this and this happened.</v>

3657
03:08:17.640 --> 03:08:20.160
<v Speaker 4>But even if you did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm telling you,</v>

3658
03:08:20.161 --> 03:08:22.590
<v Speaker 4>it's just seems way more impressive than</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is.</v>

3659
03:08:22.970 --> 03:08:25.380
<v Speaker 4>It's not that impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because like most days,</v>

3660
03:08:25.381 --> 03:08:28.740
<v Speaker 4>like jamie and I do a podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we worked for three hours maximum.</v>

3661
03:08:28.950 --> 03:08:32.220
<v Speaker 4>He works more than me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He worked four and a half and we're</v>

3662
03:08:32.221 --> 03:08:34.530
<v Speaker 4>done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we do that like three days a week.</v>

3663
03:08:34.830 --> 03:08:36.810
<v Speaker 4>And that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's a podcast right?</v>

3664
03:08:36.811 --> 03:08:38.760
<v Speaker 4>And Then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then there's the,</v>

3665
03:08:39.170 --> 03:08:42.720
<v Speaker 4>the fake research that goes into finding</v>
<v Speaker 4>podcast guests,</v>

3666
03:08:42.930 --> 03:08:44.880
<v Speaker 4>which is just really just shit I'm</v>
<v Speaker 4>interested in.</v>

3667
03:08:44.881 --> 03:08:46.320
<v Speaker 4>I never think like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

3668
03:08:46.321 --> 03:08:47.450
<v Speaker 4>I've got to fuck.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Who's that?</v>

3670
03:08:49.230 --> 03:08:51.090
<v Speaker 4>Who is this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a character.</v>

3671
03:08:51.091 --> 03:08:52.750
<v Speaker 4>you're going to come in and a wig?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3672
03:08:53.190 --> 03:08:56.850
<v Speaker 4>we're cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you had rat radley balko on yet.</v>

3673
03:08:57.290 --> 03:08:58.150
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>andy kaufman,</v>

3674
03:08:58.151 --> 03:09:01.640
<v Speaker 4>he used to work for a police and now</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's huffington post.</v>

3675
03:09:02.310 --> 03:09:06.540
<v Speaker 4>he's the guy that gets,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's an investigative journalist that</v>

3676
03:09:06.600 --> 03:09:11.600
<v Speaker 4>does all the cops that stopped people</v>
<v Speaker 4>and bust them and steal their shit.</v>

3677
03:09:13.030 --> 03:09:14.550
<v Speaker 4>He wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he wrote a book last year.</v>

3678
03:09:14.551 --> 03:09:17.400
<v Speaker 4>The rise of the warrior cop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

3679
03:09:17.401 --> 03:09:18.420
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3680
03:09:18.421 --> 03:09:19.410
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have that book,</v>

3681
03:09:19.411 --> 03:09:19.800
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

3682
03:09:19.800 --> 03:09:21.450
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's fucking brilliant.</v>

3683
03:09:21.540 --> 03:09:22.560
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have that book.</v>

3684
03:09:22.860 --> 03:09:26.610
<v Speaker 4>That's when I was books that I started</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then I just got distracted and never</v>

3685
03:09:26.611 --> 03:09:27.650
<v Speaker 4>finished it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Get a myth.</v>

3686
03:09:27.660 --> 03:09:30.430
<v Speaker 4>Fucking unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not even their fault.</v>

3687
03:09:31.200 --> 03:09:33.510
<v Speaker 4>That's the same thing we were talking</v>
<v Speaker 4>about earlier.</v>

3688
03:09:33.511 --> 03:09:38.511
<v Speaker 4>And I really believe in my office,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no motivated algae about a technology</v>

3689
03:09:39.181 --> 03:09:42.780
<v Speaker 4>progresses and as long as people stay</v>
<v Speaker 4>alive and you can feed them,</v>

3690
03:09:42.950 --> 03:09:45.240
<v Speaker 4>there is no famine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no diseases.</v>

3691
03:09:45.480 --> 03:09:47.100
<v Speaker 4>Technology's going to continue to</v>
<v Speaker 4>progress.</v>

3692
03:09:47.730 --> 03:09:52.730
<v Speaker 4>I think that like the same thing happens</v>
<v Speaker 4>With like enforcing the law,</v>

3693
03:09:53.530 --> 03:09:54.350
<v Speaker 4>whether it comes</v>

3694
03:09:54.350 --> 03:09:58.810
<v Speaker 3>or trying to make money or whatever it</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that people pursue.</v>

3695
03:09:58.811 --> 03:10:03.340
<v Speaker 3>They tried to improve upon whatever</v>
<v Speaker 3>results they've had the previous</v>

3696
03:10:03.341 --> 03:10:05.020
<v Speaker 3>trimester,</v>
<v Speaker 3>semester,</v>

3697
03:10:05.021 --> 03:10:06.490
<v Speaker 3>year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>quarter,</v>

3698
03:10:06.491 --> 03:10:09.040
<v Speaker 3>whatever the fuck it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just an inherent part of being a</v>

3699
03:10:09.041 --> 03:10:11.770
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if it's about busting people,</v>

3700
03:10:12.040 --> 03:10:14.950
<v Speaker 3>you want a bus more fudging people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

3701
03:10:14.970 --> 03:10:17.170
<v Speaker 3>it's a game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it becomes an busting.</v>

3702
03:10:17.171 --> 03:10:20.500
<v Speaker 3>You becomes a game and as soon as it</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a wind loss,</v>

3703
03:10:20.650 --> 03:10:24.490
<v Speaker 3>then you're getting people that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>addicted to like winning in football or</v>

3704
03:10:24.491 --> 03:10:28.720
<v Speaker 3>baseball or fucking whatever else it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or dancing with the stars.</v>

3705
03:10:29.020 --> 03:10:30.830
<v Speaker 3>When is dancing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

3706
03:10:30.870 --> 03:10:34.000
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a competition.</v>

3707
03:10:34.990 --> 03:10:37.750
<v Speaker 3>For years people have not been judged</v>
<v Speaker 3>for their next.</v>

3708
03:10:38.420 --> 03:10:43.310
<v Speaker 2>No one would watch it and it's no shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one would watch it until it became a</v>

3709
03:10:43.311 --> 03:10:45.050
<v Speaker 2>competition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It should be.</v>

3710
03:10:45.300 --> 03:10:46.400
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As one of your pins.</v>

3711
03:10:46.850 --> 03:10:49.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything's one of our bits.</v>

3712
03:10:49.370 --> 03:10:53.910
<v Speaker 2>I know the bots,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bots being uh,</v>

3713
03:10:54.230 --> 03:10:58.850
<v Speaker 2>when we've been doing it this long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you realize you're just doing an old</v>

3714
03:10:58.851 --> 03:11:00.560
<v Speaker 2>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3715
03:11:00.950 --> 03:11:04.010
<v Speaker 2>In a way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean how many coffees something you</v>

3716
03:11:04.011 --> 03:11:07.760
<v Speaker 2>thought of before and now you're saying</v>
<v Speaker 2>it different on a podcast in a</v>

3717
03:11:07.761 --> 03:11:09.680
<v Speaker 2>conversational way and then you go,</v>

3718
03:11:10.050 --> 03:11:12.790
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And even in the most original thought,</v>

3719
03:11:12.791 --> 03:11:14.290
<v Speaker 3>there's still like a rhythm to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3720
03:11:14.291 --> 03:11:16.540
<v Speaker 3>There's still that rhythm of three that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we all follow.</v>

3721
03:11:16.780 --> 03:11:21.780
<v Speaker 3>If for some reason works well because</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're deaf now I don't know if it's</v>

3722
03:11:23.680 --> 03:11:25.270
<v Speaker 3>genetics or real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is,</v>

3723
03:11:25.360 --> 03:11:26.400
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3724
03:11:26.710 --> 03:11:28.600
<v Speaker 3>of course I know gen x are real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know.</v>

3725
03:11:28.601 --> 03:11:33.280
<v Speaker 3>It's like expressing ideas through jokes</v>
<v Speaker 3>from one parent to child.</v>

3726
03:11:33.281 --> 03:11:36.940
<v Speaker 3>I don't knoW if that's possible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but people believe it is that they</v>

3727
03:11:36.941 --> 03:11:41.650
<v Speaker 3>believe that it's possible that memes</v>
<v Speaker 3>and even racism might be passed from.</v>

3728
03:11:41.651 --> 03:11:43.240
<v Speaker 3>And I don'T mean memes like internet</v>
<v Speaker 3>means,</v>

3729
03:11:43.241 --> 03:11:46.180
<v Speaker 3>but like ideas like ideas might be able</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be passed,</v>

3730
03:11:46.690 --> 03:11:51.690
<v Speaker 3>like the reaction and contemplation and</v>
<v Speaker 3>solution of an idea might be passed from</v>

3731
03:11:55.001 --> 03:11:59.800
<v Speaker 3>parent to child where the child almost</v>
<v Speaker 3>immediately goes to the same resolution</v>

3732
03:11:59.801 --> 03:12:02.260
<v Speaker 3>or solution that the parent did almost</v>
<v Speaker 3>instinctively.</v>

3733
03:12:02.410 --> 03:12:04.060
<v Speaker 3>Like they have it programmed their</v>
<v Speaker 3>genome,</v>

3734
03:12:04.210 --> 03:12:09.210
<v Speaker 3>but it's really controversial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've seen that footage of the monkeys</v>

3735
03:12:09.581 --> 03:12:11.040
<v Speaker 3>with assault and.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3736
03:12:11.041 --> 03:12:13.160
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly what that is,</v>

3737
03:12:13.440 --> 03:12:14.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of ways they've done it with</v>

3738
03:12:14.951 --> 03:12:19.930
<v Speaker 3>mice where they figured out a way to</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a citrus smell and they would spray</v>

3739
03:12:19.931 --> 03:12:22.180
<v Speaker 3>the citrus smell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would smell it and they would shock</v>

3740
03:12:22.181 --> 03:12:25.900
<v Speaker 3>their feet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the mice offspring who did not</v>

3741
03:12:25.901 --> 03:12:30.100
<v Speaker 3>experience the same experiment still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they would blast the citrus smell,</v>

3742
03:12:30.220 --> 03:12:32.300
<v Speaker 3>they would have some sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3743
03:12:32.301 --> 03:12:35.680
<v Speaker 3>a reaction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a stress reaction to like something</v>

03:13:49.960 --> 03:13:53.440
<v Speaker 1>I have a novel that I just know it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>republication of uh,</v>

3769
03:13:53.480 --> 03:13:58.480
<v Speaker 1>my first novel that was published in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>uk a while ago and it got great reviews</v>

3770
03:13:59.000 --> 03:14:00.310
<v Speaker 1>and it was never published in the u.</v>

3771
03:14:00.310 --> 03:14:02.120
<v Speaker 1>S beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

3772
03:14:02.121 --> 03:14:03.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fiction.</v>

3773
03:14:03.320 --> 03:14:07.490
<v Speaker 1>I never read fiction and I tried to read</v>
<v Speaker 1>his book,</v>

3774
03:14:07.491 --> 03:14:11.360
<v Speaker 1>but I know him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm listening to the first 30,</v>

3775
03:14:11.361 --> 03:14:16.361
<v Speaker 1>40 pages in his voice and then then I</v>
<v Speaker 1>got past that and it was funny as shit.</v>

3776
03:14:19.280 --> 03:14:24.280
<v Speaker 1>So I went to his apartment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was staying there when he was away and</v>

3777
03:14:24.681 --> 03:14:28.310
<v Speaker 1>I just left it with the last three pages</v>
<v Speaker 1>unread.</v>

3778
03:14:28.490 --> 03:14:33.490
<v Speaker 1>Like I read the whole book and became so</v>
<v Speaker 1>disinterested in three pages.</v>

3779
03:14:35.300 --> 03:14:37.670
<v Speaker 1>I left it open like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't notice.</v>

3780
03:14:38.840 --> 03:14:40.970
<v Speaker 1>That'S true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's probably digging up.</v>
