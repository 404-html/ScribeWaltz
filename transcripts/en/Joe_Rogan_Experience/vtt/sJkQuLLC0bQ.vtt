Release the hounds.

13
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.000
Herman Cain.
Explain it.

14
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.020
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

16
00:01:07.431 --> 00:01:10.190
They're following scared me.
It scared me with your tricky work.

17
00:01:10.191 --> 00:01:13.850
I'm a sound Duncan trussell's here folks.
Hello.

18
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.580
And Whenever Duncan trussell's here.
Sure it gets weird.

19
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.770
That's your realm bro.
You're,
you're the king of weird shit.

20
00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.380
Speaking of Weird Shit.
You know how they,

21
00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.650
it's odd that they call the flashlight a sex toy.

22
00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.340
Why did they get it's toys the wrong word for what that is.
That's it.

23
00:01:31.341 --> 00:01:33.440
That's cool.
Not a toy.

24
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.320
A toy makes it seem like you would like sit and like Gi joes would play on top

25
00:01:39.381 --> 00:01:43.510
of it.
Okay.
Well it's,
it's toy I think because of the fact that it's silly.
Yeah.

26
00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.620
<v 0>You can't help but laugh at it.
Yeah.
I guess you play with it.</v>

27
00:01:47.621 --> 00:01:51.700
You know what it's like a less offensive way of describing what it really is.

28
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:53.990
Some thing you fuck,
you

29
00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.480
<v 1>know?
Imagine if it just said that it's the fleshlight something you fuck,</v>

30
00:01:57.481 --> 00:02:01.100
that'd be great.
I just call it that.
1 million times better than a sex toy.

31
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.080
It's like a John Wayne Gacy term.
You got,

32
00:02:04.081 --> 00:02:08.430
you kids want to play with my sex twice in the basement.
You know,
they,

33
00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.040
they sell sex toys at target now they're do.
Yeah,
they,
they,
they,

34
00:02:13.041 --> 00:02:15.180
they have all these new companies are not new companies,

35
00:02:15.181 --> 00:02:19.080
like condom companies are now getting into vibrators and like they have

36
00:02:19.081 --> 00:02:23.760
vibrators now at a target and it's called like personal massage units or

37
00:02:23.761 --> 00:02:28.230
something.
But it's just vibrators at target really.
Yeah.

38
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.270
But they have to pretend it's for something else.

39
00:02:30.271 --> 00:02:33.140
They have to show the girl like rubbing her face with it so it doesn't even to

40
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.820
temples.

41
00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.250
So strangely a big fucking rubber dick is that you're out oppressed society.

42
00:02:38.251 --> 00:02:40.590
So fucking repressed.
Did they get,

43
00:02:40.591 --> 00:02:44.690
they got to call the person on the side or they can't say a fuck tool and you've

44
00:02:44.691 --> 00:02:46.740
got to call it a toy if you do this,
that.

45
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.440
And the other weird thing about it is if you want to talk about sex,

46
00:02:49.441 --> 00:02:51.210
you have to say,
well,
it's adult entertainment.

47
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.760
Like what's that me adult entertainment that makes you think you're going to be

48
00:02:56.761 --> 00:03:00.810
watching a symphony,
not like fucking do that.

49
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.420
All this repression when it comes to sexuality is a direct result of

50
00:03:04.421 --> 00:03:06.520
overpopulation.
Is that what it is?

51
00:03:06.521 --> 00:03:11.430
Is it like we feel overpopulated and we're trying to slow down?
Yeah,
no,

52
00:03:11.431 --> 00:03:14.430
I don't think,
I've never thought that.
I think it's all based on the,
uh,

53
00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.090
[inaudible] it's all based on the fundamentalists of all religions are,

54
00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.490
where's their urge from,
with this urge to control sexuality.

55
00:03:24.491 --> 00:03:26.710
What is the root of it as an m?

56
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.150
It's a kinds of extreme and m you know that joke you do about,
um,

57
00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.010
that joke you do about the priests sitting in the fucking,
in the,

58
00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.150
in the confession booth with this tiny little hole is they listened to people

59
00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.000
tell their darkest secrets.
That's us.

60
00:03:43.001 --> 00:03:47.320
An m like that could be in a sex club if there was no confession booths,

61
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.470
that would probably be a thing where it's like,
yeah,
go into secret booth,
man.

62
00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:55.580
People tell you really dirty things and he can't jerk off this,
that crazy.

63
00:03:55.581 --> 00:04:00.070
Yeah.
That must be so hot for them.
Oh,
you're like really crazy stories.

64
00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.220
It's erotic dude.
It's really sexy cause these,
because you know,

65
00:04:03.221 --> 00:04:04.780
there's guys in the booth being like,
man,

66
00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.860
I put my fingers in her pussy and then she wanted her father.

67
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.980
She wanted me to fist her pussy.
Cool.
Go on.

68
00:04:11.981 --> 00:04:16.570
My son and I was just pumping and pumping and father,
she's Squirt,

69
00:04:16.571 --> 00:04:19.570
she squirted father,
you haven't had sex.
You're,

70
00:04:19.571 --> 00:04:24.380
this is a guy who isn't theoretically not had sex in years listening to live or

71
00:04:24.381 --> 00:04:27.070
maybe they have,
I mean they had,

72
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.980
they have at least they have nocturnal emissions.

73
00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:34.020
Like they come at night and their sleeve priests are always blast and just,

74
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.080
this is at night

75
00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:40.130
<v 3>dickless that after all we know in 2011 that people that anyone would not,</v>

76
00:04:43.261 --> 00:04:45.180
not even just that anybody would do that,

77
00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.360
but then anyone would at all take anybody willing to do that seriously and not

78
00:04:50.881 --> 00:04:55.320
think they're fucking crazy.
Like when you see the pope,
like having an interview,

79
00:04:55.321 --> 00:04:57.720
like sitting down with great heads of states,

80
00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.390
politicians and kings and queens from around the world,

81
00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.330
you're literally looking at this guy like this is,

82
00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.620
this guy's wearing a fucking superhero outfit.
Okay.

83
00:05:07.621 --> 00:05:12.621
He's wearing some crazy Jesus superhero outfit on and he's getting to tie and

84
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.960
he's a fucking cult leader and he's getting to talk to presidents.

85
00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:21.330
If Catholicism was new,
if it just came out,
if someone just advantaged it,
okay.

86
00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:25.110
You would for sure make fun of it.

87
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:29.520
And for sure it would be labeled a cult,
no different than the moonies.

88
00:05:29.521 --> 00:05:30.690
No different than the Hari.

89
00:05:30.691 --> 00:05:35.340
Krishna is no different than any other new ideology that tries to get introduced

90
00:05:35.341 --> 00:05:39.560
into our system.
But Catholicism is one of the weirdest ones.

91
00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:42.270
I mean,
as someone who grew up in it,
you know,

92
00:05:42.271 --> 00:05:46.020
someone just spin around those churches and the stained glass windows and

93
00:05:46.021 --> 00:05:48.480
everything is dark and no one is fucking

94
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.190
<v 1>happy.
But how about the trans substantiation of the communion wafer?</v>

95
00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.960
Why they believe that they convert the communion wafer into the flesh of Jesus?

96
00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:58.070
Yeah.
What?
And they bully they,
it's

97
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.710
<v 4>not assemble.
There's like I,
I've heard that,</v>

98
00:06:00.711 --> 00:06:03.200
that they really truly believe when they do their,

99
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.290
whatever the spell is over the crisp,

100
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:11.390
that it turns into Jesus skin and then they're breaking up the flesh of Jesus in

101
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:15.140
consuming the flesh of the man.
God,

102
00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:16.890
<v 0>they don't really,
you know,
they'll only,</v>

103
00:06:16.891 --> 00:06:20.970
people who are really into Catholics are dudes who are fighting off the gay and

104
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.570
a lot of old women,
a lot of old women get really an old man.

105
00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.910
And like get the fuck Outta here with this.
It's old Catholics that I knew it.

106
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.370
I had the joke about Catholics suicide bombers,

107
00:06:30.371 --> 00:06:33.060
so you'll never see a Catholic suicide bomber cause none of us believe in it

108
00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:37.860
that much.
Catholicism was like,
fuck it.
You never know religion.

109
00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:42.300
It might be real but you know it's fun.
Count on this.
But old women,

110
00:06:42.301 --> 00:06:45.660
old women and dudes fighting off the guy.
Good dudes fighting off the gay man.

111
00:06:45.661 --> 00:06:47.670
They dive into the fucking Lord's word.

112
00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:50.610
When I was in high school there was this poor kid who wanted to be a priest and

113
00:06:50.611 --> 00:06:55.530
he was just fighting off the cock just every day.
He was like the space shuttle,

114
00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:00.620
reentering orbit with leaky titles and just fighting off the urge.

115
00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:02.050
Just dial in the car.

116
00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:06.780
He was so gay and he was really religious man.
I think he became a priest.

117
00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:11.490
<v 4>Please God keep cocks out of my mouth today.</v>

118
00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:17.770
<v 0>I was reading about this fucking crazy story where there's a lesbian couple and</v>

119
00:07:17.771 --> 00:07:20.290
they have a son and they want to,

120
00:07:20.291 --> 00:07:25.291
the son is 11 years old and they want to block his hormones because he says that

121
00:07:25.931 --> 00:07:27.850
he's a girl and he wants to be a girl.

122
00:07:27.851 --> 00:07:32.851
So they want him to be positioned for gender reassignment at 11 years old.

123
00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:37.360
But he's making his decisions and his name is Tommy,

124
00:07:37.361 --> 00:07:39.730
but they say that he only refers to Tammy.

125
00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:43.210
He calls himself Tammy dresses and dresses and he wants to be a girl.

126
00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:47.650
She's parkade.
Yeah.
What happened there is,
do you think the kid is,

127
00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:50.440
is that uh,
um,
an emotional thing?

128
00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:54.340
Is that a physiological thing?
Does anybody have that nailed?

129
00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:56.380
Like why people wish that they were another side?

130
00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:59.990
<v 4>I guarantee that it's not like just a decision for an 11.</v>

131
00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:03.800
No 11 year old is going to like put themselves through turning into a,

132
00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:04.671
he wasn't just like,

133
00:08:04.671 --> 00:08:06.440
this is going to be interesting and they don't try to be a girl.

134
00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:10.710
<v 0>Well,
according to the parents,
um,
he had done that since he was a baby baby.</v>

135
00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:11.940
It's physiological.

136
00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:17.010
So you think it's just some wacky coincidence that this is happening in the

137
00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:20.760
presence of this lesbian couple that's raising him?
You know,

138
00:08:20.761 --> 00:08:24.570
cause this is where the real argument comes in about sociology versus
physiology.

139
00:08:24.571 --> 00:08:29.400
Like what,
what exactly causes certain behavior or certain once and inclinations?

140
00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:34.370
I don't know,
you know,
I mean,
I'm,
no,
I'm no expert,
but I,
you know,

141
00:08:34.410 --> 00:08:38.370
I know that people were real uncomfortable when they hear that a lesbian couple

142
00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:42.720
has a boy that they adopted and that this boy is being considered for gender

143
00:08:42.721 --> 00:08:46.620
reassignment to become a woman at 11.
Even want to go like,
whoa.
It was okay.

144
00:08:46.621 --> 00:08:51.120
Did you,
what do you guys like?
Can I sit down and talk to you?
You know,

145
00:08:51.121 --> 00:08:53.720
how do you feel about men?
You fucking hate him?

146
00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:58.150
Do you talk shit about him day please?
His mom?
I don't know.
No,

147
00:08:58.151 --> 00:09:01.800
I don't think that.
I definitely don't think,
I don't have an opinion.

148
00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:04.700
I have no opinion.
You know,
I honestly,
I,
I,
uh,

149
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:07.540
I just find the whole subject to be incredibly fascinating though,

150
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:10.320
whole idea of gender reassignment term.
It's fascinating.

151
00:09:10.321 --> 00:09:13.050
It sounds like something happened to even in the military,

152
00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:17.610
obviously gender reassignment,
boy,
it's like the robot military,

153
00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.390
they should not let,
like,

154
00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:24.510
hopefully that kid has to be 18 to honestly be able to do that,
right?
No,
no,
no,

155
00:09:24.511 --> 00:09:25.070
no,
no.

156
00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:29.850
What they're trying to do is they're trying to give the kid a blockers that keep

157
00:09:29.851 --> 00:09:32.490
him from reaching puberty.
That's,
yeah,
but that's,

158
00:09:32.491 --> 00:09:35.060
that should be against the law for them to be able to do that.
I would,

159
00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:38.020
that's what I would think that the kid can't make a decision for himself.

160
00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:42.760
I don't think you can fucking Jack Nature like that at 11.
You,

161
00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:45.120
you don't know what you're doing.
You don't know the repercussions.

162
00:09:45.121 --> 00:09:50.040
How could an 11 year old possibly wrap their head around the idea of what they

163
00:09:50.041 --> 00:09:52.290
should be responsible with for the whole future?
They're not,

164
00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:55.560
you're not a man yet.
You're not even responsible for yourself.
You know,

165
00:09:55.980 --> 00:10:00.480
your mom has to check to make sure you wipe your butt,
you know,
and you're 11,

166
00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:03.900
you know,
I can't imagine.
I can't imagine that said,

167
00:10:03.901 --> 00:10:05.460
I have a friend who's going through that.

168
00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:10.710
I have a friend whose son is going through a gender reassignment issue and
these,

169
00:10:10.711 --> 00:10:13.290
um,
that's a new,
is that a new word?
That's a new term.

170
00:10:13.291 --> 00:10:17.990
This is like a new add or something.
I've never believe it is.
I think,
you know,

171
00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:20.580
that's what they calling it when they chop your dick off.

172
00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:26.730
I was scared to the patients up.
This is the chop your dick off clinic.

173
00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:31.270
Oh,
you're here to get yourself a fake vagina and no penis.
So,
right.

174
00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:35.580
Like do items on the menu,
giving them money.
Yeah.

175
00:10:35.581 --> 00:10:40.430
That's two hours of chop your dick off.
Chop your Dick off.
Uh,

176
00:10:40.431 --> 00:10:43.950
so,
so a Dick,
oh,
well for women,
you know,
the,
the,

177
00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:47.430
I don't know how many of them get an artificially constructed penis.

178
00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:52.390
They convert the clearest,
right?
Well,
not really.
What they do is,
um,

179
00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:53.311
for the most part,

180
00:10:53.311 --> 00:10:57.780
they just jack them up with roids and roids make the clit turned into like a

181
00:10:57.781 --> 00:10:59.790
little Dick Shit.

182
00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:04.320
The clitoris and the penis are apparently made out of the same sort of tissue

183
00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:09.000
and when the clitoris is in the presence of massive doses of testosterone,

184
00:11:09.001 --> 00:11:13.500
just chimpanzee rage doses,
it becomes a dick.

185
00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:16.530
It gets so ferocious,
it grows like a rhino horn

186
00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:21.480
and that's just from just pumping test into a woman's body.

187
00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:25.590
It's so crazy to me,
man.
I,
I've been around bodybuilders before.

188
00:11:25.591 --> 00:11:27.630
I knew girls that did roids for sure.

189
00:11:27.631 --> 00:11:29.940
There was girls that at this gym that I went to,

190
00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:31.890
there's a one one gym that I went to in north Hollywood.

191
00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:35.190
They were fucking gigantic women.
They were big.

192
00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:37.860
They were like a buck 80 solid muscle,

193
00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:41.370
5% body fat dude,
you don't get that way.

194
00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:43.900
There's a lady who used to live down the street from me that was like a Miss

195
00:11:43.901 --> 00:11:47.700
Olympia.
So you know,
it's,
it's a weird thing man.

196
00:11:47.701 --> 00:11:49.710
You start when they do it backwards,
they're like,

197
00:11:49.711 --> 00:11:51.410
when they take the tick off to make it a pussy,

198
00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:54.190
don't they used to put the dick hole and then they kind of like just open

199
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:57.460
<v 5>it up like an artichoke or something like that?
I think yes.</v>

200
00:11:57.461 --> 00:11:58.510
Something along those lines.

201
00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:04.180
I think they actually tried to sever the penis and use it to line the skin of

202
00:12:04.181 --> 00:12:07.810
the vagina.
So as the PR,
if the person's still gets excited,

203
00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:12.640
they still have like a feeling,
but they can't orgasm anymore.
No orgasms forever.

204
00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:15.930
It makes me wonder then like if there's tearing sensation to get,
you know,

205
00:12:15.931 --> 00:12:19.120
like you see those videos that were like,
people are shoving pencils up there,

206
00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:22.960
Dick Holes and stuff like that.
Of course it has.
Does that feel good?

207
00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:29.240
Does it have a sensation?
It's kind of things that a new way to check off.
Um,
I,

208
00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:31.570
I think once it heals up,

209
00:12:31.571 --> 00:12:35.290
it probably doesn't feel too terrible and they're probably so excited about the

210
00:12:35.291 --> 00:12:39.190
fact that I got this little fake pussy that probably they'd probably feels good.

211
00:12:39.191 --> 00:12:42.040
I thought you meant pencil on your Dick Hole.
That's like,

212
00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:47.260
that's horrible.
And you pause for a second.
I'm like,
no,

213
00:12:47.261 --> 00:12:47.890
no,

214
00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:50.950
because it's the same hole is what I'm saying is when they split up in the dig

215
00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:53.680
and
that's the whole year.

216
00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:59.140
That's a good question.
You might be right.
He might be right.

217
00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:04.870
There's no way you're fucking,
you're,
you're,
they're not fucking,
I'm just saying,

218
00:13:04.871 --> 00:13:05.980
right.
They stretch it out.

219
00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:10.260
Get your penis trainer like an anal trainer.

220
00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:12.250
The first person who did this operation,

221
00:13:12.251 --> 00:13:15.070
that's what I want to know that start out with the shell of a bullets.

222
00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:19.990
Let's start off with a number one pencil and they go to number two and then they

223
00:13:19.991 --> 00:13:23.650
go to that night's fact,
three one that we actually get to a 38 round.

224
00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:28.090
We really pack it in there and stretch on the tip of that car and it's a six

225
00:13:28.091 --> 00:13:30.610
month process until it becomes something that you can fist.

226
00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:35.160
I've seen videos of chicks knuckle deep and

227
00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:41.790
really pushing down and do his Dick Hall just fishing around down.

228
00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:46.490
No bacteria on those nails,
fecal matter.

229
00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:48.460
And this girl,

230
00:13:48.461 --> 00:13:52.270
I know she does webcam videos and a lot of guys do that.

231
00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:56.440
I was surprised she will screen capture all of them

232
00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:02.020
so they can see her as she sees them.

233
00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:07.180
That what's that chat relay?
Is that the thing that shakes do?
I'm sorry,

234
00:14:07.181 --> 00:14:12.181
is that the thing that tricks do now you you beat off and they look at you one

235
00:14:12.341 --> 00:14:13.600
on one.
It's kind of like,

236
00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:17.710
it's what you always used to do with girls from forms and stuff for free.

237
00:14:17.711 --> 00:14:21.310
But now they're charging like something like $10 every two minutes.

238
00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:25.270
And it's kind of cool because now you're making a personalized porn video,

239
00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:27.670
you know?
So it's pretty much like chat roulette.

240
00:14:27.671 --> 00:14:32.110
But the girl is hot on the other side.
They can screen capture,

241
00:14:32.111 --> 00:14:35.250
they can get photos of everything as well.
It's mostly just cocked.

242
00:14:35.251 --> 00:14:39.550
They don't have faces and terrible.
She's like all screen capture and Dick's.

243
00:14:39.551 --> 00:14:44.230
That's just rude man.
There's great
fictional.

244
00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:47.950
Well he going to have to take out of the beat off of the [inaudible] only does

245
00:14:47.951 --> 00:14:50.820
it when it's pencils in the Dick Holes.
You know what I mean?

246
00:14:50.821 --> 00:14:53.540
I can crazy or there's something ridiculous.

247
00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:56.510
Doesn't she have to take an oath before she becomes a Webcam?

248
00:14:56.511 --> 00:14:58.820
And you should have to like have a hippocratic oath.

249
00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:03.390
<v 0>Okay.
Not Allowed to harm a little take screenshots and dude's Dick.</v>

250
00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:06.660
You're here in the service industry.
That's right.
Oh,

251
00:15:06.661 --> 00:15:08.700
I screen capture all that time.
All Day.

252
00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:12.120
There really should be sexual service industry.
There really should be,
you know,

253
00:15:12.121 --> 00:15:15.360
the idea that that's illegal.
It's so fucking gross.
You know,

254
00:15:15.361 --> 00:15:19.920
I think it probably causes more rape causes more anger if

255
00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:23.850
I don't want my daughter to be a prostitute of course.

256
00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:27.630
But if prostitution with legal people are going to do it and guess what?

257
00:15:27.631 --> 00:15:30.260
Some people are going to actually like to do it and some people are going to

258
00:15:30.261 --> 00:15:32.370
enjoy going there and some people,

259
00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:35.430
they're just crazy bitches and they really wouldn't do anything else anyway.

260
00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:37.380
And what are you gonna do?
Are you gonna fix the whole world?

261
00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:38.370
You're going to fix the whole world?

262
00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:42.180
Or are you going to let them get tested and get taxed and let them be treated

263
00:15:42.181 --> 00:15:46.570
like they're not some outlaw.
You know,
it's not an,
it's an outlaw thing.
You're a,

264
00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:51.270
if you're a prostitute,
you're a criminal.
If you're giving away sex for free,

265
00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:55.110
you're just a whore.
But if you're actually getting money for it,
you go to jail,

266
00:15:55.111 --> 00:15:56.520
they lock you in a cage.

267
00:15:56.730 --> 00:16:01.470
And the idea that we still have that in 2011 regardless of what your beliefs are

268
00:16:01.471 --> 00:16:04.350
about sex,
whether you should or shouldn't go to a prostitute.
I agree.

269
00:16:04.351 --> 00:16:07.650
That's kind of a weird thing.
It's a little dehumanizing.
The whole conditions.

270
00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:10.430
It's very strange,
but fucking for sure it should be illegal.

271
00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:12.990
You can't lock people in a jail.

272
00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:16.560
You lock people in a cage for making someone feel good with their mouth.

273
00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:21.300
What the fuck is wrong with you?
It's insanity.
It's absolute fucking insane.

274
00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:25.230
Fucking lunacy,
man.
Complete insanity.
And the fact that it's not challenged,

275
00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:29.840
the fact that that's not challenged in 2011 like what?

276
00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:32.270
<v 5>And the fact that apple is not censoring it off as Siri.</v>

277
00:16:32.271 --> 00:16:34.640
When you're asking for a blow job and they tell you what they look,

278
00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:39.170
the closest escort agency is.
Did you know that this is what he did?
He asked it.

279
00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:42.350
He,
he's actually,
no,
I haven't told you this.
I go,
I took it last night.

280
00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:45.290
I just sit there in bed and try new things,
you know,
and I'm sitting there.

281
00:16:45.291 --> 00:16:47.300
He'll go,
I need to,
I want a blow job.
And they're like,

282
00:16:47.301 --> 00:16:51.470
we found Ford escort agencies closest to you and it was like 27 miles away.

283
00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:54.820
You know,
Steve Jobs,
his program,
do some shit in there.
That's it.

284
00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:57.050
Just waiting for someone to say the right thing.

285
00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:00.170
I just hope they don't start censoring it though.
Apples keep on going that way.

286
00:17:00.171 --> 00:17:02.180
Make it like the Internet.
Don't start censoring it.

287
00:17:02.181 --> 00:17:06.500
That's fucking cool that you actually have that in their portal,
Siri.

288
00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:10.070
He just put it in there knowing eventually.
Right.

289
00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:14.410
<v 0>What is exactly going to happen on December 21st,
2012</v>

290
00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:19.500
<v 5>cannot access future node.
That's fine.</v>

291
00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:22.530
Yeah.
That's fucking cool man.
One thing that seems interesting.

292
00:17:22.531 --> 00:17:26.400
It seems like that it's a run off a server because it's been,
you know,

293
00:17:26.401 --> 00:17:28.710
everyone's activating this Siri,

294
00:17:28.711 --> 00:17:32.070
which is a remote assistant on the new iPhone four s is what we're talking
about.

295
00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:36.860
<v 0>Well,
you know what it's based on,
right?
Uh,
the dragon or no,</v>

296
00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:38.400
based on Wolfram Alpha,

297
00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:42.980
which was that search engine that was created by all these PhDs they wanted,

298
00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:46.920
they literally wanted to put together the concept is a website that can answer

299
00:17:46.921 --> 00:17:49.810
any questions.
So no matter what your question,
you know how I'm,

300
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:54.560
<v 5>what is the weight of one pound of nuclear waste it before I've used it for a</v>

301
00:17:54.561 --> 00:17:58.590
ship.
Yeah.
Awesome.
Yeah,
so apparently that's what,
that's what,

302
00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:01.880
what's behind all that?
That's really cool.
It's amazing.
Yeah.

303
00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:05.930
When you asked for a dead body,
it goes a sewer and old warehouse.
A junk yard.

304
00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:09.150
Yeah.
He said where to put a dead body.
Yeah.
You didn't make that.

305
00:18:09.151 --> 00:18:11.730
I thought this is a fake.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

306
00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:15.540
I've been laying in bed using it just like fucking making up shit.

307
00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:17.880
You ever have a device?

308
00:18:17.881 --> 00:18:20.250
If you ever have a gadget and you want to learn everything about it.

309
00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:24.750
I just by Brian One too,
right?
Then I say,

310
00:18:24.751 --> 00:18:26.580
where are we at now?
And he's like,
dude,

311
00:18:26.581 --> 00:18:29.310
this is what I just found out and he'll find shit on it that you would never

312
00:18:29.311 --> 00:18:32.730
figure it out yourself.
Fucking know.
Yeah,
well he's just a gadget whore.

313
00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:37.500
I need to figure it out with them and I think it's run off a server,

314
00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:41.490
like I think like that they're going to be able to constantly upgrade it as time

315
00:18:41.491 --> 00:18:44.700
goes on.
And I'm just worried now that with all the attention to all the,

316
00:18:44.701 --> 00:18:47.530
of course the x rated stuff that they're going to start censoring it.

317
00:18:47.531 --> 00:18:50.270
It went and I hope they don't start doing that and,
but,

318
00:18:50.271 --> 00:18:53.250
but it is cool to think like what Siri in five years is going to be,

319
00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:56.580
just like when we first saw the iPhone one to see how it's changed the

320
00:18:56.581 --> 00:18:59.160
technology from then it's going to be pretty much a PR,

321
00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:02.010
like most relationships without sex,
it's going to be better than that.

322
00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:05.070
You know it's,
it's,
it's going to be anything you want to talk about.

323
00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:07.950
Any questions you have to add and you're going to,
it's going to learn.

324
00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:09.870
It's going to get to know you.
It's,
you know,

325
00:19:09.871 --> 00:19:12.840
it's pretty much going to be like artificial intelligence.

326
00:19:12.841 --> 00:19:15.870
I think that relationships with that sex,

327
00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:18.870
cause what else says that you're sitting there talking to a computer?

328
00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:23.800
Most of the like most like a relationship without sex.
What?

329
00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:29.090
You won't feel the same if you know that the robot is there for you because it's

330
00:19:29.281 --> 00:19:30.810
artificial,
you're going to abuse it.

331
00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:33.120
It's not like a person that you love to have around.

332
00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:36.570
I think most people would probably just beat the fuck out of their robots.

333
00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:42.840
The robot wasn't a person but was always going to like look out for them and be

334
00:19:43.021 --> 00:19:43.860
there for them.

335
00:19:43.861 --> 00:19:46.890
And then you would find that robot but ignoring and you would kick his ass cause

336
00:19:46.891 --> 00:19:49.650
you know he couldn't fight back to protect you.
Right.

337
00:19:49.651 --> 00:19:53.290
But if it gets to know you better and me,
I'm already late.
Oh man,
it's a robot.

338
00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:57.360
But if it gets to know what your answers would be in your personality better

339
00:19:57.390 --> 00:20:01.160
cause I'm already interested in it and it's just not even smart right now.

340
00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:05.100
But what if it starts to get to know you and now you're so interested in it,

341
00:20:05.101 --> 00:20:09.600
like crack.
If you fall in love with your phone.
Yeah,
she's,

342
00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:10.530
she has things.

343
00:20:10.531 --> 00:20:13.410
I even asked it to sing the other day and I started singing me a song.

344
00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:18.450
I mean it's pretty much,
it's,
it has,
it's fascinating.
Like I want it,

345
00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:22.560
I'm addicted to it.
I'm addicted to Brian just got a curse.
The iPhone,

346
00:20:22.561 --> 00:20:24.690
it's not Siri,
it's got a demon.
And

347
00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:31.530
I mean if you were a real fundamentalist,
if there's anymore Satan,
this is,

348
00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:34.440
this is the devil in the machine.
Oh,
that's right.
That's true.

349
00:20:34.441 --> 00:20:37.110
That's what Satan does.
You know,
someone told me once,

350
00:20:37.111 --> 00:20:41.310
Satan cannot create,
only God can create.

351
00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:43.650
Seitan is only capable of imitation.

352
00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:48.070
That's why Satan is the God of music,
of rock

353
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:49.940
<v 1>music.
Satan is the God.</v>

354
00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:54.880
It's like I love dudes who just like have knowledge like that.
Oh,

355
00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:58.360
they want to give it to you.
This is I'm going to tell you,

356
00:20:58.361 --> 00:21:02.050
and they're all confident and they're just saying just crazy shit.
Yeah,

357
00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:04.630
just think about that.
Just think about that.

358
00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:06.670
I've always said that if you believe in the devil,

359
00:21:06.671 --> 00:21:08.260
that's a different kind of crazy cause.

360
00:21:08.261 --> 00:21:12.610
There's a lot of people that will talk all day about God.
Like on TV.

361
00:21:12.611 --> 00:21:17.170
God bless America.
May God save our troops.
You know,
God is on our side,

362
00:21:17.171 --> 00:21:20.260
Bush and God is on our side on TV.
I believe God is on our side.

363
00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:23.750
Could you imagine if he said,
we found the devil,
he's in Afghanistan.
Yeah.

364
00:21:23.751 --> 00:21:26.950
He'd be like,
oh,
this guy's crazy.
Oh yeah,
that is a fucking mine.
Well,
you don't,

365
00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:31.600
you didn't really find the devil,
but it's okay to invoke God into the equation.

366
00:21:31.601 --> 00:21:34.990
As long as it's sort of an abstract thing that you're pretty sure you're never

367
00:21:34.991 --> 00:21:38.530
going to meet in this light.
It's amazing what invoking God can do.

368
00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:40.720
I mean clearly the God that the Christians are invoking,

369
00:21:40.721 --> 00:21:44.530
if there isn't Satan is Satan because the god that they're invoking as this like

370
00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:49.740
homophobic destroyer of like everything that isn't a Christian.

371
00:21:50.621 --> 00:21:54.030
And if you don't fear him,
he will fuck you up to you up.
He will.

372
00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:56.980
Anything bad,

373
00:21:56.981 --> 00:22:01.210
he'll fuck you up so bad that fucking Herman Cain if you like.

374
00:22:01.211 --> 00:22:02.170
There's a thing on the Internet,

375
00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:06.840
somebody asking Herman Cain what he thinks about homosexuality and his response

376
00:22:06.841 --> 00:22:11.560
is,
well,
I'm a Bible believing Christian and so I believe it's a sin.

377
00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:13.960
So if you think about that,

378
00:22:13.961 --> 00:22:18.640
this guy's running for president and those two things he put next to each other,

379
00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:22.330
he believes that there's a fucking someone of the same.

380
00:22:22.331 --> 00:22:25.570
Gender is not just bad,
it's bad.

381
00:22:25.571 --> 00:22:30.571
On a metaphysical level it's bad because there is a super intelligent being out

382
00:22:31.931 --> 00:22:36.931
there that gets infuriated when these microscopic Amoeba like creatures put

383
00:22:38.321 --> 00:22:42.250
their penis in an in an asshole of the same gender.

384
00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:45.700
He believes in that creature and that fucking guy.

385
00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:49.150
Once the keys do the largest nuclear arsenal,

386
00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:54.840
you can't give him that.
Do you think they re I dispel,

387
00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:56.200
I don't believe that anymore.

388
00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:59.440
I don't believe they have the rights to the largest nuclear arsenal and apply.

389
00:22:59.441 --> 00:23:01.950
I don't believe the president has any size.
Say,

390
00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:06.160
I think the president is just doing a job.
He's in there playing a role.

391
00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:10.540
I think it's really clear now and the clearest evidence of that as Obama.

392
00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:11.530
What Obama,

393
00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:16.530
the way he's changed his stance on things from being a presidential candidate to

394
00:23:16.631 --> 00:23:21.250
being the president and his done everything that you would have asked him to do

395
00:23:21.251 --> 00:23:25.570
if you were in corporate America,
you were one of the people that put him at all.

396
00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:27.670
He's done everything you've asked.
It's like a maitre d,

397
00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:31.000
including what they're doing with the pharmaceutical companies going after

398
00:23:31.001 --> 00:23:35.290
medical marijuana.
Now closing down stores,
threatening,
uh,

399
00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:37.090
take their property owners.
Yeah.

400
00:23:37.091 --> 00:23:40.090
People who are renting places out to medical marijuana places.

401
00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:41.980
They're saying they're gonna take their property away.

402
00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:46.160
They're threatening newspapers for airing advertisements for medical

403
00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:47.230
<v 3>marijuana.
Meanwhile,</v>

404
00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:51.980
there's been study after fucking study after fucking study showing so many

405
00:23:51.981 --> 00:23:54.320
benefits that people have that are sick.
You know,

406
00:23:54.321 --> 00:23:58.790
forget about people like me who just use it because I like the way it makes me

407
00:23:58.791 --> 00:24:01.880
feel.
You know what I mean?
I mean,
it makes me relax though.
I like,

408
00:24:01.881 --> 00:24:02.870
it helps me go to sleep.

409
00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:06.800
<v 4>No,
I'm fine.
Do you know any reason?
Just like aspirin,
if you have a headache,</v>

410
00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:10.010
you should be able to take aspirin.
Goddammit.
You're a fucking grown human being.

411
00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:12.520
Yeah.
The idea that a one person should be able to stop you.

412
00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:17.210
<v 3>Ridiculous.
But in this day and age,
with all the information that we have now,</v>

413
00:24:17.211 --> 00:24:19.730
the fact that it's still illegal at a certain point in time,

414
00:24:19.731 --> 00:24:22.310
you just have to fucking scream.
Okay.

415
00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:25.700
<v 4>It just infuriates infuriate well,
the a poll just came out,</v>

416
00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:29.690
it just was popping up on the Internet that now 50% of Americans believe that

417
00:24:29.691 --> 00:24:33.740
marijuana should be legal.
And somebody tweeted to me that in California,

418
00:24:33.741 --> 00:24:37.430
like the Medical Association came out and said that they think it should be

419
00:24:37.431 --> 00:24:39.200
legal because it causes more harm,

420
00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:43.700
breaks up more families that the war on it is breaking up families,
you know,

421
00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:44.930
taking people's property.

422
00:24:44.931 --> 00:24:49.160
Why putting people in jail that's a million times more harmful than whatever

423
00:24:49.161 --> 00:24:51.800
they're,
the harmful effects may be if smoking marijuana,

424
00:24:51.801 --> 00:24:54.860
which is far as I can tell her like naps that are too good.

425
00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:59.310
And it makes world of Warcraft fucking unavoidable.

426
00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:03.680
And your life,
it does make food taste better and makes sex feel good too.
Yeah.

427
00:25:03.681 --> 00:25:06.830
So it's so,
so there's,
uh,
so yeah,
when you start,

428
00:25:06.831 --> 00:25:10.130
when like that I got really depressed when that shit started hitting Twitter

429
00:25:10.131 --> 00:25:14.680
about Obama cracking down again.
Like I got really,
I like,

430
00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:16.520
like,
like sad.

431
00:25:16.521 --> 00:25:19.910
I still am a little gloomy from that because it's just this idea of like what

432
00:25:19.911 --> 00:25:22.070
are we in fucking more door and Lord of the rings,

433
00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:25.790
is there some guy on like a black thrown with fucking uh,

434
00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:27.550
metal gloves and Oh,

435
00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:32.560
horn helmet being like we must crush the marijuana that is making these people

436
00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:37.580
slapping.
Yeah,
exactly.
You can not have the people be happy,

437
00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:38.800
happy.

438
00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:43.000
<v 3>The grossest example of corruption available rosis example of corruption.</v>

439
00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:46.030
Whenever there's something where someone's trying to crack down on thing.
No,

440
00:25:46.031 --> 00:25:46.840
this,

441
00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:50.530
when someone is threatening the crackdown on something where they're going after

442
00:25:50.531 --> 00:25:53.350
certain organizations.
Ha,
there's money involved.

443
00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:56.110
100% there's money involved.
Right.

444
00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:59.830
And the money can go one way or the other.
You know,

445
00:25:59.831 --> 00:26:02.830
it could go that they realize they can make a lot of money through these medical

446
00:26:02.831 --> 00:26:06.370
marijuana places and the marijuana places give them a nice fat tax.

447
00:26:06.371 --> 00:26:10.540
Like maybe say,
hey,
instead of,
you know,
uh,
whatever tax we're playing.

448
00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:13.990
How about medical marijuana?
You make them pay x amount of tax,

449
00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:17.500
maybe just a little bit more that those profits go to try to straighten out the

450
00:26:17.501 --> 00:26:19.750
economy a little bit.
Yeah.
And uh,
you know,

451
00:26:19.751 --> 00:26:21.850
and everybody's still can make a shitload of fucking money.

452
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.950
Then they have to stop packing thing and go,
wow,

453
00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:26.370
they're giving us more money than the pharmaceutical companies aren't.
Right,

454
00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:27.640
right.
And then,

455
00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:31.090
and only then are you going to be able to fucking stop all this bullshit?

456
00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:32.890
You're going to have to have a marijuana lobby.

457
00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:35.920
You're going to have to have people that have shitloads of fucking money and

458
00:26:35.921 --> 00:26:40.030
they want marijuana to be legal.
And then all of these current politicians,

459
00:26:40.031 --> 00:26:43.950
all these corrupt little whores with their assholes sticking straight up in the

460
00:26:43.951 --> 00:26:47.220
air,
all of them will come around,
all of them.

461
00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:50.280
But that's only then only when they get the people who put them in office,

462
00:26:50.281 --> 00:26:53.670
when their daddies who put them in position and tell them what the fuck to say.

463
00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.190
There's no clear piece of evidence that Obama,

464
00:26:56.191 --> 00:27:00.600
a man who admitted he smoked marijuana and they're locking people in cages for

465
00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:01.100
second

466
00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:04.510
<v 4>property taking their problem right in front of their closing down.</v>

467
00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:07.120
<v 3>Why are they doing it?
There's only one reason money.</v>

468
00:27:07.150 --> 00:27:12.100
There's only one reason someone is making money off it,
not being legal

469
00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:16.330
<v 4>or there's the deep,
that's one part of it.
But there is like that deeper uh,</v>

470
00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:19.020
id o and the deeper conspiracy theory about it,

471
00:27:19.021 --> 00:27:20.610
which is that it's not just the money.

472
00:27:20.611 --> 00:27:25.611
It's the fact that that state of consciousness it induces isn't one that works

473
00:27:25.741 --> 00:27:28.650
for a capital o type of capitalism we have right now.

474
00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:32.370
And I think there's something to that man,
if people start,

475
00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:37.550
and also it's like try getting really high on a really good weed and start

476
00:27:37.621 --> 00:27:42.210
thinking about those fucking drones zooming around Afghanistan and plast and

477
00:27:42.211 --> 00:27:43.170
missiles at kids.

478
00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:48.410
And it's like you'll really start getting a clear understanding of how fucked up

479
00:27:48.541 --> 00:27:49.740
that is.
You know,

480
00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:53.490
no matter what even let's say even those drone attacks we had to do them,

481
00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:58.500
it's still fucked up.
It still creates more of a sensitivity towards,
um,

482
00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:02.140
people getting their limbs blown off of their bodies,
um,

483
00:28:02.590 --> 00:28:06.660
in the pursuit of some ridiculous war.
And that kind of,
you know,

484
00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:09.210
that's hitting the military industrial complex.

485
00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:13.020
It's hitting the pharmaceutical companies because if you start getting high,

486
00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:16.500
you're going to start experiencing a better level of happiness.

487
00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:18.930
It's going to make you start dealing with your bullshit.

488
00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:21.030
Or maybe you don't make you depressed because you're lazy,

489
00:28:21.031 --> 00:28:25.800
but either way it won't allow you to like sink into the kind of sedated hypnosis

490
00:28:25.801 --> 00:28:30.801
that it seems like that works really fucking well for Applebee's.

491
00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:33.780
You know,
it works really well for the corporations,

492
00:28:33.781 --> 00:28:38.781
for people to be in a sedated hypnotic state where they can really make sense of

493
00:28:40.471 --> 00:28:44.850
going down to a shopping mall and,
and like eating at a fucking,

494
00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:47.250
I dunno,
chicken place with their,

495
00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:49.940
with their kids and then going up and buying some shit.

496
00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:54.570
At a shoe store and then spinning their day just consuming shit they don't

497
00:28:54.571 --> 00:28:58.050
really need and then going home and sitting back to watch TV with more

498
00:28:58.051 --> 00:29:01.530
advertisements and not thinking that's weird and falling asleep and that kind of

499
00:29:01.531 --> 00:29:06.300
depress lumber that is really hard to do if you're high,

500
00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:11.370
if you're really high,
it's really hard to watch normal TV and not be like,

501
00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:16.380
this is horrible.
Look at these advertisements.
Are you kidding?

502
00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:19.770
They think that that's going to work on me.
Oh my God.

503
00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:24.590
$48,000 for a fucking car you're going to pay for.

504
00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:27.510
That's like over a year's wage.
For some people,

505
00:29:27.511 --> 00:29:32.511
you're going to make sense of buying a brand new car payments of $285 a month

506
00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:36.420
when you for like four grand,
you can go buy a fucking car,

507
00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:40.140
get it fixed up through the year and have like a shit load extra money and not

508
00:29:40.141 --> 00:29:43.450
be in debt.
That's what part makes you think if you're,
you know,

509
00:29:43.451 --> 00:29:47.950
but if you're like drunk and you're fucking scratching your balls and watching

510
00:29:47.951 --> 00:29:52.080
the game and a fucking the new Lexus,
you'll start thinking like,
well,

511
00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:53.920
my credit score went up this year.

512
00:29:54.550 --> 00:29:58.660
I think I might be able to take out a loan from the bank and get a new Lexus.

513
00:29:58.870 --> 00:30:02.380
Even though you're fucking broke and living in hell and it's going to just

514
00:30:02.530 --> 00:30:05.890
create this weight on your budget that's going to make you miserable.
Dude,

515
00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:08.500
I don't mean to go on a long rant,
but did I ever tell you the time?

516
00:30:08.770 --> 00:30:11.440
A friend of mine picked me up and it's fucking Mercedes and took me to his

517
00:30:11.441 --> 00:30:13.380
apartment.
Debra,
tell you this.
No,

518
00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:17.490
you had a brand new Mercedes and I know this guy knew what his job was picking

519
00:30:17.491 --> 00:30:19.450
me up in his and I knew he can afford a Mercedes.

520
00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:21.850
Picks me up in his brand new Mercedes and he's like,
Hey,

521
00:30:21.851 --> 00:30:25.780
I got to stop by my apartment.
Come inside for a second,
go into his apartment.

522
00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:28.270
It is a size of a fucking closet.

523
00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:32.920
It is the smallest department I've ever seen in my life.
Like barely could eat.

524
00:30:32.921 --> 00:30:36.490
Like he had to like kind of like almost like walk sideways against the wall to

525
00:30:36.491 --> 00:30:38.320
get around the bed to get to the bathroom.

526
00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:41.720
It's like a New York style just shit box.

527
00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:46.330
Meanwhile that guy's car payments have gotta be like five 5,600 a month.

528
00:30:46.331 --> 00:30:51.331
I mean this is a nice fucking Mercedes and in his mind he had like his logic

529
00:30:52.031 --> 00:30:55.930
behind it was like yeah it's better to have like a really nice car then like a

530
00:30:55.931 --> 00:31:00.370
comfortable living situation.
I talk about this,
he's like a d one last thing.

531
00:31:00.490 --> 00:31:03.160
That guy is a tramp demon cause why?

532
00:31:03.161 --> 00:31:07.240
Cause he's a tramp demon because Trump see that Mercedes and they're like let's

533
00:31:07.241 --> 00:31:10.480
go back to your apartment cause they think he's rich and then they get in this

534
00:31:10.481 --> 00:31:13.020
tiny little fucking shitty closet space.

535
00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:17.220
<v 0>We have some rap about that.
They're making my new place or fixing up town.</v>

536
00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:18.580
Staying here for a little while.

537
00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:22.740
<v 4>Yeah.
See Ya.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's so fucking set,</v>

538
00:31:22.741 --> 00:31:25.960
the look on those tramps face when they walk in that door and realize it,

539
00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:27.970
they barely room to stand.

540
00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:31.360
There's like two feet of carpet between the door and the bed.

541
00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:35.330
<v 0>There's a lot of people who believe in those really small sustainable houses.</v>

542
00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:37.010
You know,
that people are making these like really,

543
00:31:37.011 --> 00:31:41.240
really little houses and you like move things out for the kitchen and move

544
00:31:41.241 --> 00:31:45.020
things up in the bed is like a little loft area and you know,
and yeah,

545
00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:47.480
like it's like a whole trend on the internet.

546
00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:48.590
There's a lot of people who are doing that.

547
00:31:48.730 --> 00:31:51.520
<v 4>It's cool.
I don't think there's anything wrong about living simply.</v>

548
00:31:51.521 --> 00:31:55.100
It's just hilarious when people,
uh,
oh yeah,
no,

549
00:31:55.230 --> 00:32:00.010
throw themselves into hellish debt,
uh,
for a symbol.
Yeah.
And,
and,
and well,

550
00:32:00.011 --> 00:32:00.470
it's not just,
just

551
00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:04.540
<v 0>that honestly,
it's a,
you,
you,
you,
you enjoy the fuck out of a nice car.
Sure.</v>

552
00:32:04.541 --> 00:32:05.560
You get an a Mercedes,

553
00:32:05.561 --> 00:32:07.930
you can't believe you're allowed to drive this thing everywhere where you go,

554
00:32:08.050 --> 00:32:10.090
people look at you like you must be special looking at him.

555
00:32:10.091 --> 00:32:12.160
He's getting into that Mercedes.
I'm like,
oh my God.

556
00:32:12.161 --> 00:32:15.730
For a lot of people that is a tangible benefit of having a car like that they

557
00:32:15.731 --> 00:32:18.430
liked this quarter.
You could say it's shallow all day,

558
00:32:18.431 --> 00:32:20.740
but men driving one of those things is beautiful.

559
00:32:20.741 --> 00:32:25.360
It's an amazing piece of engineering and as a a year head,
you know,

560
00:32:25.361 --> 00:32:28.330
I'm sort of a minor league area because I don't know exactly how all of it
works.

561
00:32:28.331 --> 00:32:33.100
Yeah.
But like Adam Corollas,
like a legit gearhead and he can like build cars.

562
00:32:33.370 --> 00:32:36.430
I just like buy them from people who know how to build them and they appreciate

563
00:32:36.431 --> 00:32:40.130
the fuck out of him.
I think they're interesting,
but the driving

564
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:44.780
<v 1>one you've drive like a really well engineered piece of,
it's amazing,
man.
I,</v>

565
00:32:44.781 --> 00:32:48.880
if I had shit shitloads of money,
I would buy a nice car.

566
00:32:48.930 --> 00:32:52.310
I wouldn't feel weird about it.
Cause anything to like to,

567
00:32:52.311 --> 00:32:57.311
to dull the fucking existential horror that comes over me on the one oh one and

568
00:32:57.681 --> 00:33:02.210
traffic.
That's beautiful.
I'm just saying when those commercials,

569
00:33:02.570 --> 00:33:05.750
you know,
there are,
they're not just appealing to rich people.
They're,
they're,

570
00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:10.780
they're manipulating idiots into somehow convincing them that they're logically

571
00:33:11.691 --> 00:33:16.670
makes sense to get in debt to a bank for 50 grand.
It's not just idiots.

572
00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:21.110
It's people that are not happy.
That's what they're offering you happiness.
See,

573
00:33:21.111 --> 00:33:23.210
most people throughout their day,

574
00:33:23.390 --> 00:33:26.570
they have a job that can occasionally be interesting,

575
00:33:26.571 --> 00:33:29.790
but they would never fucking do for free.
And whether they're good at or not,

576
00:33:29.791 --> 00:33:32.120
they take some sense of pride in their work.
They get through their day,

577
00:33:32.270 --> 00:33:35.660
but they're fucking tired,
man.
And people were unsatisfied.

578
00:33:35.661 --> 00:33:37.850
They feel like they worked so fucking hard.

579
00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:41.630
They put so much in and what am I getting?
I'm just existing to,

580
00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:45.980
this is what I'm doing.
I'm existing.
So what do they do?
They get fucking shit.

581
00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:47.960
They buy a new bowling ball,
they get a new,

582
00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:51.290
they get a new Lexus and no one for them.
You know,

583
00:33:51.291 --> 00:33:52.550
for some of them you say it's sad,

584
00:33:52.551 --> 00:33:55.310
but for some of those guys that are stuck in that life,
no matter what they do,

585
00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:56.400
that might prevent,

586
00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:59.710
that might give them like a little bit more happiness driving,
you know?
Yeah.

587
00:33:59.750 --> 00:34:01.730
But that's plastic and nice new Mustang on the way.

588
00:34:01.731 --> 00:34:04.040
The word plastic fucking fruit.

589
00:34:04.041 --> 00:34:07.430
I mean really the idea is get underneath that.
Don't start.

590
00:34:07.431 --> 00:34:09.890
You're starting at the top start way deep.

591
00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:14.780
Start down deep and then worry about the fucking Mercedes for you.
Yes,

592
00:34:14.810 --> 00:34:17.210
for you,
for you,
for a guy who thinks,

593
00:34:17.630 --> 00:34:22.630
but for someone who's just locked into the life of a drone and accepts it and

594
00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:24.800
Nice Little Red Mercedes,
look at that.

595
00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:28.070
Look at the look on Bob's face and he's so happy.

596
00:34:28.071 --> 00:34:32.330
Then he gets into his red Mercedes.
Even the girls,
hey girls,

597
00:34:32.930 --> 00:34:37.160
I don't buy Mercedes but I didn't say ladies,
you know like I get myself in debt.

598
00:34:37.161 --> 00:34:38.870
Always have been.
I,
I did the same shit.

599
00:34:38.871 --> 00:34:42.380
I don't buy Mercedes already or go to that crazy,
but my shit was always like,

600
00:34:42.381 --> 00:34:47.381
I grew up super poor and then now I have credits so now I could buy things and

601
00:34:47.431 --> 00:34:51.590
Duke like most of my life was like hand me down shit or you know like shitty

602
00:34:51.591 --> 00:34:53.920
toys or you know,
just not like you walk.

603
00:34:53.970 --> 00:34:56.930
You live in a neighborhood with a bunch of kids that get anything they wanted

604
00:34:56.960 --> 00:35:00.590
growing up,
I can't,
I don't have to see these kids.
And you're like,
wow,

605
00:35:00.591 --> 00:35:04.370
you got vultron how'd you get Voltron?
That's just like $80,
you know,

606
00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:07.100
and then now you're an adult,
you're kind of over.

607
00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:11.060
Like if you feel like I deserve this because I didn't have that stuff growing
up,

608
00:35:11.061 --> 00:35:14.270
I,
I want what I want.
You know,
like,
like these kids always had growing.

609
00:35:14.690 --> 00:35:17.240
He fucking objects have to sue them,

610
00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:22.270
give me a big computer monitor and fucking world of Warcraft and some medicinal

611
00:35:22.971 --> 00:35:27.350
marijuana.
And that's all I need.
And that costs 1399 a month.

612
00:35:27.530 --> 00:35:31.160
Oh Shit.
I guess I can't say what that,
what I did cause it,

613
00:35:31.161 --> 00:35:35.360
they'll cancel my account.
But can I tell you what,

614
00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:37.170
can I tell you what a friend of mine did?

615
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:42.510
<v 4>A friend of mine recently went on like a really bad world of Warcraft bench.</v>

616
00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:43.710
Like he,
like,

617
00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:48.920
he didn't mean to when he started playing in this guy's name.
His name's,
uh,

618
00:35:48.921 --> 00:35:52.800
his name's Ah,
oh,
you know him.
Well,

619
00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:57.400
Hobo started playing and I,
he went in there and he started playing.
He's got to,

620
00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:00.750
me and them are similar in that we both have a level,
uh,

621
00:36:00.830 --> 00:36:04.200
83 a warlock and little Hobo started,

622
00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:07.110
little little Hobo started playing and he went in deep.

623
00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:11.430
I don't know what happened to him,
but like it's like he really,
really,

624
00:36:11.490 --> 00:36:16.080
we're really like got hooked on it for like three days and since he's deleted,

625
00:36:16.110 --> 00:36:18.750
you did delete the game from his computer so he couldn't play.

626
00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:21.150
But in the midst of this binge,

627
00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:26.330
he decided to buy gold from a one because they sell gold online for world of

628
00:36:26.461 --> 00:36:30.900
Warcraft.
They sell gold.
Do you know this?
They sell world of Warcraft currency.

629
00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:34.080
So he decided to buy just because he saw an ad and he's like,

630
00:36:34.081 --> 00:36:37.410
I wonder if this really works.
He decided to buy 6,000 gold,

631
00:36:37.411 --> 00:36:40.470
which takes a long time to gather up in that game.

632
00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:43.600
And so we went online and he ordered it and you have to put,

633
00:36:43.830 --> 00:36:47.340
he had to put his phone number in and he got a fucking call from him.

634
00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:51.510
He's Chinese.
People are like,
you buy goal,
you buy,

635
00:36:51.511 --> 00:36:55.110
go meet,
meet an Oga,
Ma at the bank.
Oh good.

636
00:36:55.111 --> 00:36:57.480
My Bank now come now like really?

637
00:36:57.530 --> 00:37:02.370
Like they couldn't really speak English that well and fucking you go and you

638
00:37:02.371 --> 00:37:06.420
meet a gold dealer in the game,
in the game.

639
00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:08.860
They call you up in real life and tell you that the gold,

640
00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:11.040
the gold is ready get online.

641
00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:14.450
Then you go and you meet this like level one character and they,

642
00:37:14.451 --> 00:37:15.900
it's like fucking drug deal.

643
00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:19.320
They have you meet kind of out there like valley of spirits come now valley is

644
00:37:19.321 --> 00:37:21.360
spirits.
You come now they're brusk.

645
00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:26.580
You go there and then they like give you 6,000 gold and their character
vanishes.

646
00:37:27.250 --> 00:37:29.460
It was so fun.
You think two things.

647
00:37:29.461 --> 00:37:33.330
Do you think either there's a Foxconn of kids that are forced to play this game

648
00:37:33.331 --> 00:37:35.250
and then all sweatshirt sweatshop?
Yeah,

649
00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:40.110
sweatshop thousand gold for for for $7 it would take,

650
00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:43.470
it would take days for me to gather up 6,000 gold,

651
00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:48.710
$7 they're getting paid like 10 cents an hour if that together or blizzards.

652
00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:53.040
One of the most intelligent companies in the whole entire world and they

653
00:37:53.041 --> 00:37:55.560
discovered that like,
hey,
this is like paying,
you know,

654
00:37:55.561 --> 00:37:57.540
we could act like these people existed.

655
00:37:57.690 --> 00:38:00.930
You know where we're actually making money.
Like we just made $7 off Dunkin.

656
00:38:00.931 --> 00:38:05.760
You know,
we made up this imaginary goal.
This was some blade runner shit.

657
00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:10.790
This is like kids in a fucking bunker.
It was like,
it's,

658
00:38:10.791 --> 00:38:13.830
it's like,
it felt genuinely,
I can't,

659
00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:17.670
well little Hobo told me that it was like one of the,

660
00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:19.583
one of the most,

661
00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:24.760
<v 6>that is one of the most fun experiences you are able to command without getting</v>

662
00:38:25.641 --> 00:38:29.920
arrested.
So glad elbows

663
00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:31.600
<v 4>back.
Yeah,
me too.
He's real.</v>

664
00:38:31.601 --> 00:38:35.440
He's been enjoying getting out on the road again is you're using the

665
00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:39.370
<v 1>little guy or the,
the little guy's been working fine.</v>

666
00:38:39.371 --> 00:38:42.970
Nobody seems to want to see it seems to care.
It's the same thing.

667
00:38:42.971 --> 00:38:45.970
It's just with like the little guys a little cuter.
He's a little nicer.

668
00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:49.090
Not on state.
I mean he's,
he's an ass on tweeter.

669
00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:52.450
Looking what you were saying that it is like blade runner type shit.

670
00:38:52.451 --> 00:38:56.200
It really is.
We're,
we're things are getting so bizarre,
bizarre.

671
00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:59.230
They're getting so bizarre.
And the closing with the Siri thing,

672
00:38:59.231 --> 00:39:01.720
you're absolutely right Brian.
This is the next level.

673
00:39:01.870 --> 00:39:05.950
This ability to interact with your inner eyes.
Yeah,
we're,
we're,

674
00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:09.600
we're like knocking on the door of some really,
really bizarre times.

675
00:39:09.601 --> 00:39:10.780
You know what?
I think it is many things.

676
00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:15.220
I think the next thing it's going to be interactive surfaces where it's going to

677
00:39:15.221 --> 00:39:19.450
be like some,
it's,
it's some kind of like,
I don't know,

678
00:39:19.451 --> 00:39:22.270
material that you could lay down on top of a table,

679
00:39:22.271 --> 00:39:26.020
like kind of like tile or just some kind of cloth you could lay on top of

680
00:39:26.021 --> 00:39:28.390
something that turned into a screen.

681
00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:30.550
So I think that the new thing is going to be,

682
00:39:30.551 --> 00:39:34.300
they're going to be walls made of interactive surfaces so that you could tell

683
00:39:34.301 --> 00:39:34.991
the wall,
you know,

684
00:39:34.991 --> 00:39:39.280
like beach view and suddenly you're just sitting on some beautiful beach looking

685
00:39:39.281 --> 00:39:40.101
out at the ocean.

686
00:39:40.101 --> 00:39:44.710
I think they already have that shit like that wall technology,

687
00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:46.030
but it's gotta be,
it's going to get,

688
00:39:46.031 --> 00:39:48.790
I think it's going to get like totally normal.
Like,
you know,

689
00:39:48.791 --> 00:39:50.870
we're now when you go to a hotel and you're like,
oh fuck,

690
00:39:50.930 --> 00:39:54.160
they don't have wireless.
It'll be like,
you'll go to a hotel and be like,
ah,

691
00:39:54.161 --> 00:39:57.790
there's no interactive surfaces and no,
this doesn't have interactive walls.

692
00:39:57.910 --> 00:40:01.600
I think eventually what it's going to be is we're going to have hologram units

693
00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:04.820
and that you're going to be able to watch things and Hologram,
you know,

694
00:40:04.821 --> 00:40:08.010
like you'll be able to look,
you remember when,
uh,
uh,

695
00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:12.100
was it r two d two had princess Leia and real,
there's a little,

696
00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:16.380
a little video that you could watch and it was her help us.
He'll be one year,

697
00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:18.970
so primitive,
you know,
when you think about it.
But um,

698
00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:22.780
I think eventually there'll be some sort of a large form of that total living

699
00:40:22.781 --> 00:40:25.210
room.
Like your living room.
We'll have an open space.

700
00:40:25.211 --> 00:40:29.110
Instead of having a 55 inch TV,
you'll have like a 55 inch square on the ground,

701
00:40:29.590 --> 00:40:29.951
you know,

702
00:40:29.951 --> 00:40:33.670
and then there'll be something above it and they'll just project some three

703
00:40:33.671 --> 00:40:35.890
dimensional totally and fully three dimensional.

704
00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:37.720
And you can control with your hands.

705
00:40:37.721 --> 00:40:39.520
You can like move shit around with your hands and stuff.

706
00:40:39.521 --> 00:40:41.260
I mean that when that happens,

707
00:40:41.530 --> 00:40:45.640
that's when fucking starcraft two is going to become the ultimate sport because

708
00:40:45.641 --> 00:40:49.180
they're going to put that shit in like Ah,
they're going to put that in stadiums.

709
00:40:49.370 --> 00:40:54.050
Imagine I wish I was sponsored by blizzard.
They're going to have it like,
uh,

710
00:40:54.310 --> 00:40:59.310
stadiums are going to be laid out with these huge holograms of like video games

711
00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:03.640
fighting each other.
That look super realistic.
That's coming.

712
00:41:03.641 --> 00:41:08.260
I know it's going to happen.
It's going to be so imagine if they have life size,

713
00:41:08.290 --> 00:41:09.310
video game,

714
00:41:09.370 --> 00:41:13.500
hologram things interact with each other and you could watch a game of quake.

715
00:41:13.501 --> 00:41:18.130
Play out.
Exactly.
Watch,
play out in an arena.
Watch like a dude,

716
00:41:18.131 --> 00:41:23.110
like an artificial dude
shooting guns and shit.
That's where it's heading,

717
00:41:23.111 --> 00:41:27.100
man.
It's already like so fucking fun to watch.
E sports.
I'm hooked.

718
00:41:27.310 --> 00:41:30.850
I've been watching these starcraft two tournaments and they're like bad ass.

719
00:41:30.851 --> 00:41:34.820
There's so fun to watch when you know what's happening.
Fucking Koreans,
man.

720
00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:39.020
They're the fucking,
they are to star craft what black people are to football.

721
00:41:39.021 --> 00:41:44.021
They're just like being through read things through everyone.

722
00:41:44.421 --> 00:41:48.080
There's so good man.
And they have like the way they set up the cameras,

723
00:41:48.081 --> 00:41:50.540
they show like their hands on the keyboard.

724
00:41:50.541 --> 00:41:52.640
Sometimes you can see how fast they're moving their hands.

725
00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:55.340
It's like lightening fast.

726
00:41:55.341 --> 00:41:58.430
It's like $100,000 is what they're competing for.

727
00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:03.380
So it's real money and it's fucking cool.
Well quick thinking and intelligence,

728
00:42:03.381 --> 00:42:08.050
you know it is really what's required to play star.
Yeah,
that's a,

729
00:42:08.070 --> 00:42:09.320
that's a tricky ass game.

730
00:42:09.321 --> 00:42:12.710
That's not like I was in debt like fast twitch muscle games.

731
00:42:12.711 --> 00:42:16.700
I was into like aim games like quake because it was like really intense.

732
00:42:16.701 --> 00:42:20.390
I was into like one on one duals and all that type of shit.
But the,
the,
the,

733
00:42:20.391 --> 00:42:23.750
the amount of calculations involved in a game like starcraft,

734
00:42:23.751 --> 00:42:26.510
it's not just like moving your hands quick.

735
00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:30.170
There's no one on the automatic,
it's fat.

736
00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:34.010
It's that it's fast twitch because you do have to be able to move super fast and

737
00:42:34.011 --> 00:42:35.860
there's like,
the way they break it down is there's like,

738
00:42:35.890 --> 00:42:40.520
it's not an aim fast twitch.
Oh No.
Cision involved in like quick,

739
00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:45.020
like you had to get like set special mouses with like mices Meese,
mice,

740
00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:49.350
whether were three,
2000 DPI,
300 DPI.
Like,

741
00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:54.520
like they had these razor mindset that they created specifically just to make as

742
00:42:54.870 --> 00:42:57.450
her,
yeah,
but you need them as much fuck yeah,
because,

743
00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:01.310
because like the micro gate,
the macro game is like your big plan,
what your,

744
00:43:01.311 --> 00:43:04.700
what different setups you're going to use to try to defeat your opponent and the

745
00:43:04.701 --> 00:43:07.400
broad scale.
Then there's the micro game,
which is,

746
00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:11.470
so when you're having individuals score skirmishes between armies sell,

747
00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:16.250
like I only do macro,
I'm terrible at micro.
But uh,
the micro game is,

748
00:43:16.251 --> 00:43:19.760
let's say you've got like five [inaudible] five zero s which are these like

749
00:43:19.790 --> 00:43:23.630
alien predatorial creatures and they're fighting five protons,

750
00:43:23.631 --> 00:43:27.810
which are like kind of like Saifai space people.
Uh,

751
00:43:28.050 --> 00:43:30.170
you have to,
you have to like,

752
00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:33.230
if you're really good is your unit start getting injured.

753
00:43:33.410 --> 00:43:34.940
You pull them out of the fight,

754
00:43:34.941 --> 00:43:37.820
you pull them back out of the fight so that they don't get killed and they can

755
00:43:37.821 --> 00:43:40.940
heal in the back.
While the people who aren't getting hurt can fight.

756
00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:44.750
And there's like tricks based around that and you've got to move fast as fuck to

757
00:43:44.751 --> 00:43:47.750
pull that off.
And meanwhile,
while you're doing that in the middle of a skirmish,

758
00:43:47.930 --> 00:43:50.960
you gotta be thinking about all the shit back at your base.

759
00:43:50.961 --> 00:43:55.961
Your fucking spawning pool has got to get adrenal glands on your fucking exurbs.

760
00:43:56.330 --> 00:44:00.890
You gotta update your fucking high.
Your queens got to be spread the Queens,

761
00:44:01.010 --> 00:44:05.120
cause I played Zurich.
They were like bad as aliens.
The queens like the Queens,

762
00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:08.480
they spit this.
They know.
I think it comes out of their ass.

763
00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:13.160
They like turn around and spray this weird high with their eggs and that light

764
00:44:13.161 --> 00:44:16.880
creates larva.
From what?
You grow these aliens,
you gotta be thinking,

765
00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:20.150
I've got to spray the fucking hive.
I gotta make a God damn it.

766
00:44:20.151 --> 00:44:24.080
I don't have time for this.
I've got to make a failing nest.
It's awesome.

767
00:44:24.081 --> 00:44:26.900
No time for this gay men about the olive garden.
What the fuck was that?

768
00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:31.530
It's the greatest game.
It's the greatest game all the time.
Well,

769
00:44:31.531 --> 00:44:34.080
I guess if you really get into it,
it'd become your life though.

770
00:44:34.110 --> 00:44:37.680
It seems like it's so complex and there's so much involved in it.

771
00:44:37.850 --> 00:44:42.270
Do you kind of have to play it all day?
Do you find yourself ever,

772
00:44:42.670 --> 00:44:44.460
sometimes you got to moderate,

773
00:44:44.461 --> 00:44:46.980
I mean you've got to take control of yourself later.
It seems like you,
you're,

774
00:44:46.981 --> 00:44:48.990
you're,
you're constantly being stimulated.

775
00:44:48.991 --> 00:44:52.200
You're constantly having tasks to perform.
It's never ending,

776
00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:54.720
especially if you're playing on when you're playing against a person.

777
00:44:54.721 --> 00:44:59.520
And so you're getting the added silly endorphin rush of like crushing someone

778
00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:01.080
and also it ranks you.

779
00:45:01.081 --> 00:45:04.130
So the way they got it set up is there's different leagues in Starcraft's that

780
00:45:04.131 --> 00:45:08.880
you have,
like the bronze league.
Then you have like,
uh,
the silver league,

781
00:45:08.881 --> 00:45:11.700
the Gold League,
I think they have one above that called the diamond league.

782
00:45:11.701 --> 00:45:14.880
So like the players,
if you were really good,

783
00:45:14.881 --> 00:45:19.200
theoretically you would rise up in the ranks and eventually you could get to the

784
00:45:19.201 --> 00:45:22.410
point where you became like,
people want to watch your games.

785
00:45:22.411 --> 00:45:25.260
People want to start watching the games that they're really good players cause

786
00:45:25.261 --> 00:45:29.820
you learn tricks from watching them and like so I like watching video games in

787
00:45:29.821 --> 00:45:30.181
general.

788
00:45:30.181 --> 00:45:33.840
I think there is a future for that because I mean I was always a fan of like

789
00:45:33.841 --> 00:45:34.290
when I,

790
00:45:34.290 --> 00:45:37.110
my friend would want to play a video game to sit there and watch him play.

791
00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:42.120
I liked it.
Now I didn't watch starcraft two it's totally your touch,
quick games,

792
00:45:42.121 --> 00:45:42.960
quick demos.

793
00:45:42.961 --> 00:45:45.690
But I don't think I would want to watch a game that I'm not aware of.

794
00:45:45.690 --> 00:45:48.930
Like I've watched people play battle field earth or one of those fucking

795
00:45:48.990 --> 00:45:51.610
battlefield.
I don't feel I've watched people play that.

796
00:45:51.611 --> 00:45:54.090
It looks like fun but it's not exciting to me cause I don't play it.

797
00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:57.990
You have to play the game to be excited about watching a video of it.

798
00:45:58.020 --> 00:45:59.520
That's true.
Otherwise it just sounds,

799
00:45:59.521 --> 00:46:02.010
it seems like in San is what I would say about pool.

800
00:46:02.011 --> 00:46:03.510
Like nobody wants to watch pool on TV.

801
00:46:03.511 --> 00:46:08.190
That's why you know what does well on TV for pool trick shot shows those stupid

802
00:46:08.191 --> 00:46:09.840
trick shot shows,
which I can't even watch.

803
00:46:10.050 --> 00:46:12.840
I have like a set up on my DVR to record pool shows,

804
00:46:12.841 --> 00:46:14.610
but whenever there's a trick shot show,

805
00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:17.850
I get annoyed like I don't want to watch this.
I don't care what they're doing.

806
00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:19.590
They're just,
it's not a game.
It's not a real game.

807
00:46:20.010 --> 00:46:24.510
The only reason why I like it is because I play pool.
If you don't play pool,

808
00:46:24.511 --> 00:46:27.780
you'd be like,
what the fuck stupid shit are you watching?

809
00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:32.960
You're watching some idiot shoot round balls at an other round balls and knocked

810
00:46:33.121 --> 00:46:35.580
him in the holes and you get excited when it goes into a hole.

811
00:46:35.610 --> 00:46:38.910
You're talking about basketball,
no pool.
Oh that too.

812
00:46:39.090 --> 00:46:42.300
Same Shit and involves any game really.
If you don't play them,

813
00:46:42.660 --> 00:46:43.660
if you don't play them you,

814
00:46:43.661 --> 00:46:48.240
you could admire great feats of physical athletic ability.

815
00:46:48.241 --> 00:46:50.850
Like when a guy can jump through the air and slam dunk a ball,

816
00:46:50.851 --> 00:46:53.760
but if you don't play it,
you don't give a fuck.
If you play it,

817
00:46:53.761 --> 00:46:57.330
then it becomes something you like.
How would I have gotten out in that game?

818
00:46:57.331 --> 00:47:00.480
How would I have dealt with his ERGs?
How would I have,
you know?

819
00:47:00.481 --> 00:47:04.560
And then that's the thing you're learning.
Yeah.
When you play it,
you're learning.

820
00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:07.320
You're kind of like watching it and getting tricks and you and you know how

821
00:47:07.321 --> 00:47:09.000
you're going to apply it.
And maybe it's like,
yeah,

822
00:47:09.001 --> 00:47:12.270
I'm sure it's so complicated though.
Oh it's,
it's incredibly complex.

823
00:47:12.271 --> 00:47:13.350
I mean it's infinitely con.

824
00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:17.730
I mean it's very complex but there are like some simple basic things that just

825
00:47:17.850 --> 00:47:20.760
mimic any,
any battle.
I mean it's,
it's,

826
00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:25.560
it's very similar to like re like real skirmishes and stuff.

827
00:47:25.561 --> 00:47:28.800
Cause you're having to be deceptive.
You're having to use deception.

828
00:47:28.801 --> 00:47:32.050
You don't want them to understand what set up you're using initially.

829
00:47:32.051 --> 00:47:33.840
Like in the very beginning of the game,
you,

830
00:47:33.970 --> 00:47:38.020
you'll send out a scout to go into their base and you'll look and you'll be
like,

831
00:47:38.050 --> 00:47:40.030
oh shit man,
it's only been like a second.

832
00:47:40.031 --> 00:47:42.250
They've already like created a spawning pool.

833
00:47:42.251 --> 00:47:43.760
That means they're going to do a zero garage.

834
00:47:43.761 --> 00:47:48.240
So that means that you're killing me.
I know.
I'm sorry.
I'll shut up.
I'm most,

835
00:47:48.490 --> 00:47:48.761
yeah,

836
00:47:48.761 --> 00:47:52.720
but it's only the only people that could understand what the fuck you're talking

837
00:47:52.721 --> 00:47:54.660
about is people that actually do it.
Yeah,
maybe.

838
00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:56.710
I mean you could sort of follow it along,

839
00:47:56.711 --> 00:48:01.030
but I mean it just seems like so fucking calm.
It's complex.
It's a complex game,

840
00:48:01.031 --> 00:48:05.740
but it's the first in what I think is going to be this entire new generation of

841
00:48:05.741 --> 00:48:10.270
these types of games and I really think it's going to grow and become like,

842
00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:14.920
I think eventually 10 years down the road they're going to have an ESPN for east

843
00:48:14.930 --> 00:48:17.920
sports where they're going to have leagues and they're going to have,

844
00:48:17.950 --> 00:48:19.830
well they're going to do in Korea.
Right?

845
00:48:20.570 --> 00:48:24.940
Like a real professional players took off in Korea like though.
But yeah,

846
00:48:24.970 --> 00:48:27.130
I do have it here,
but not like they do in Korea,

847
00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:29.890
especially star trek or star starcraft,

848
00:48:30.550 --> 00:48:33.070
starcraft and Korea's bonkers.
Judge.

849
00:48:33.071 --> 00:48:36.430
I've watched a big tournament's would they have audiences watch and it's really

850
00:48:36.431 --> 00:48:39.670
crazy.
It just took off there for some reason,
but I think it's good.
So good.

851
00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:45.100
Well because they train,
like they,
they,
they treat it like a real sports.

852
00:48:45.101 --> 00:48:48.550
So they have like coaches,
they train,

853
00:48:48.551 --> 00:48:51.400
they learned techniques and tactics and stuff.

854
00:48:51.401 --> 00:48:53.890
I think fans are intense people intense.
You know,

855
00:48:53.891 --> 00:48:58.450
I grew up all around Koreans because of my taekwondo background,
you know,

856
00:48:58.451 --> 00:49:02.320
and uh,
we were always nervous to fight Koreans too.
Like if you had a flight,

857
00:49:02.321 --> 00:49:04.870
Koreans and taekwondo tournament's everyone was terrified.

858
00:49:05.180 --> 00:49:09.790
Guy would show up with a Gian with,
uh,
with the Korea on the back of it.

859
00:49:09.791 --> 00:49:14.760
You'd shit your pants like,
oh fuck,
he's a Korean.
They just were so intense.

860
00:49:14.761 --> 00:49:17.680
It's so much better at taekwondo for a long time.

861
00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:20.830
Eventually Americans and a lot of the other,
uh,
countries caught up,

862
00:49:20.831 --> 00:49:24.340
but in the beginning they were,
they were really far ahead and so intense,
man,

863
00:49:24.850 --> 00:49:28.300
Korean people are so fucking competitive.
Dude.
Desmond,

864
00:49:28.301 --> 00:49:33.250
Korea have like one of the fastest download speeds,
if any.
Yeah,

865
00:49:33.410 --> 00:49:34.990
yeah,
they're super high tech.
You know,

866
00:49:35.290 --> 00:49:38.170
all the Samsung phones apparently are made in Korea.

867
00:49:38.290 --> 00:49:41.860
And then we were talking about the whole thing about,
um,
you know,
uh,

868
00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:43.240
sweatshops and shit like that.
Some,

869
00:49:43.241 --> 00:49:47.650
some of the parts though are still made in China,
but,
um,
they make them in Korea.

870
00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:51.220
Here's something interesting that Korea is that one of the number one podcast on

871
00:49:51.221 --> 00:49:55.300
iTunes is a Korean podcast and it's all in Korean.

872
00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:58.840
You won't even understand it or anything.
And so I was researching like,

873
00:49:58.841 --> 00:50:00.640
what the fuck is this podcast?

874
00:50:00.641 --> 00:50:03.490
Because it keeps on being number one of all podcasts lately.

875
00:50:03.820 --> 00:50:08.050
And what it is is like the Korean news is like Fox,
it's like horrible,
you know,

876
00:50:08.051 --> 00:50:12.040
just like bias news,
right?
And so this podcast is a,

877
00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:14.200
is supposedly like the daily show,

878
00:50:14.290 --> 00:50:19.290
but like for real news and it's gotten so big and finally that the Koreans are

879
00:50:19.661 --> 00:50:23.380
getting like nudes from a different source that's a little bit more honest and a

880
00:50:23.381 --> 00:50:26.620
little bit more edgy.
And for them it's blowing up right now.

881
00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:29.360
So it's kind of interesting.
I wish I could understand it though,
you know,

882
00:50:29.390 --> 00:50:33.470
I wish it was it possible to translate it.
Wow.
But,
uh,
yeah,
it's weird.

883
00:50:33.471 --> 00:50:37.220
It's pretty cool.
It's called a,
I think that d d a n,

884
00:50:37.221 --> 00:50:39.440
Z I s the dances or something like that.

885
00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:43.110
<v 3>So it's pretty interesting shit man.
Yeah,
we take it for granted.</v>

886
00:50:43.111 --> 00:50:47.590
This is censored as our media is,
we,
you know,
we're still,

887
00:50:47.591 --> 00:50:51.940
we're doing way better than a huge chunk of the rest of the world.
That's true.

888
00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:54.500
What do you think about this fucking occupy Wall Street thing,
man?

889
00:50:54.501 --> 00:50:56.040
Because this is,
you know,

890
00:50:56.330 --> 00:51:00.010
people are getting actually getting mad at me for not talking about this and uh,

891
00:51:00.011 --> 00:51:03.460
I've,
I've had people get mad on my message board out at me on Twitter.

892
00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:07.060
I've been re tweeting things left and right where you can have videos,

893
00:51:07.061 --> 00:51:08.530
retweeting all kinds of things about it.

894
00:51:08.531 --> 00:51:11.350
And I've been trying to formulate an opinion on it.
And first of all,

895
00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:12.610
it's very exciting.

896
00:51:12.850 --> 00:51:17.850
And what's exciting is that it seems like for the first time in my life that I

897
00:51:17.891 --> 00:51:21.580
can remember people are standing up to the government,
standing up to the,

898
00:51:21.790 --> 00:51:26.380
to the federal bank in a,
in a giant way.
You never seen this before.

899
00:51:26.590 --> 00:51:30.220
I've never seen just droves of people in the streets sleeping.

900
00:51:30.221 --> 00:51:33.640
They're staying there.
Cops losing their fucking Shit,
man.

901
00:51:33.820 --> 00:51:36.520
Cops freaking out because of stress and punching people.

902
00:51:36.521 --> 00:51:40.200
Have you seen these people getting maced and all the shit that's going on?
Man,

903
00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:43.780
it's,
yeah,
dude,
they're becoming white shirts.
People are calling.

904
00:51:43.781 --> 00:51:47.260
I never heard cops called white shirts short man.
Now that's what I hear.

905
00:51:47.261 --> 00:51:51.640
A white shirt punches a female protest or video on youtube or vine watching it.

906
00:51:51.970 --> 00:51:52.803
Is that what it is?

907
00:51:52.910 --> 00:51:54.180
<v 1>The white shirts are violent.
They,</v>

908
00:51:54.181 --> 00:51:58.500
the white shirts are the ones who are higher up and they,
they,

909
00:51:58.970 --> 00:52:03.170
they seem to be more entitled there.
The video is coming back that I've seen.

910
00:52:03.171 --> 00:52:07.400
It's always a white shirt in there.
I like kind of like fucking thug fat.

911
00:52:07.460 --> 00:52:10.170
They've got that thug fat or the,
you know what I'm talking about?
Like yeah,

912
00:52:10.370 --> 00:52:14.570
they're like bell shaped or something and they were just like fucking pop people

913
00:52:14.571 --> 00:52:19.160
in the face by the way.
Whoever the cop is,
what a bitch ass right hand you have.

914
00:52:19.161 --> 00:52:23.210
Dude does a terrible punk.
It was all like down in the word.

915
00:52:23.390 --> 00:52:26.870
No technique and as a professional fight commentator,
I was appalled.

916
00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:31.640
I was
like Dexter,

917
00:52:31.710 --> 00:52:35.010
I gave up on Dexter because he had a shitty rear naked choke.
Yeah.

918
00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:38.510
Lithgow had a shitty new rear naked choke choke in some girl I gave up on the

919
00:52:38.511 --> 00:52:40.690
whole season that she's done for me.
Almost done.

920
00:52:40.700 --> 00:52:44.420
I'm giving you a couple more episodes of this season's been sloppy.
Bad acting,

921
00:52:44.421 --> 00:52:47.090
bad editing,
bat writing,
bad everything.

922
00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:51.680
You can only do a show for so long until you take yourself too seriously.
Yeah,

923
00:52:51.681 --> 00:52:53.380
that's right.
I know.
Shows ever Everlast.

924
00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:55.940
That's the cool thing about the BBC is they'll just do it.
They're like,

925
00:52:55.941 --> 00:52:59.870
it's only going to be one season.
Tell the story.
In this season there's not.

926
00:52:59.871 --> 00:53:01.970
It's not going to be based on whether it's popular.

927
00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:05.870
We do it and tell the story in that sentence.
You get more quality shows.

928
00:53:06.020 --> 00:53:10.130
You don't get this shit where they extend and extend and extend and then it ends

929
00:53:10.131 --> 00:53:12.380
up petering out and a crappy way.
Well,

930
00:53:12.381 --> 00:53:15.770
the crazy thing is that we take those BBC shows,
redoing with American class,

931
00:53:15.771 --> 00:53:20.090
make a much more mediocre.
I'm gonna let you go on forever.
They just stretch out.

932
00:53:20.090 --> 00:53:24.020
Go on fucking forever.
For years and years and years.
But Dude,

933
00:53:24.021 --> 00:53:25.620
I watch the fucking walking dead.

934
00:53:25.621 --> 00:53:30.240
Two episode one C are rathers walking dead season two episode one today.

935
00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:34.620
Damn.
It is so good.
Every time I watched that show,

936
00:53:34.890 --> 00:53:38.310
I ended up curled up in my fucking chair like Jesus.
Jesus,

937
00:53:38.311 --> 00:53:42.640
Jesus took zombies in that show are so fucked up.
That's a,

938
00:53:42.750 --> 00:53:46.440
that's a legit show.
You know what else?
A legit show arc and horror story.
Oh,

939
00:53:46.441 --> 00:53:49.260
is that good?
I just started watching that and start washing.

940
00:53:49.261 --> 00:53:53.340
That freed her of Glee.
It's creepy as fuck.
Yes it is.

941
00:53:53.820 --> 00:53:57.420
Wow.
He went deep.
Dude.
This is cool.
This is,
they're doing shit.
But you can't,

942
00:53:57.421 --> 00:53:59.790
I don't want to spoiler alert.
No,

943
00:53:59.791 --> 00:54:02.610
I won't say listen to won't and tell anybody cause it's a real recent show.

944
00:54:02.611 --> 00:54:05.770
But there they do some shit that I've never seen people do on TV where I'm like,

945
00:54:05.820 --> 00:54:10.620
wow,
you can do that now.
Feels,
yeah,
it feels kind of twin peaks ish or something.

946
00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:15.510
Yeah,
it's freaky.
It's kind of David Lynch ish.
You know.
Horror movie.
No,
no.

947
00:54:15.511 --> 00:54:19.950
It's scary,
man.
It's,
it's,
it's interesting,
man.
I like it,
dude.
Um,

948
00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:22.710
but to get back to the occupy Wall Street thing,

949
00:54:24.540 --> 00:54:28.350
it's fucking insane how it's spreading all over the globe,

950
00:54:28.650 --> 00:54:32.190
not just in America.
It's spreading everywhere.
And you can't,
you know,

951
00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:34.290
it's funny how many videos,
you know,

952
00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:37.170
people have like taken up like the thing with,
what are you doing over there?

953
00:54:37.230 --> 00:54:39.780
Sorry about that.
I got the Mayan calendar here.

954
00:54:39.781 --> 00:54:42.920
I'm clutching it as we talk about the revolution.
Um,
you know,

955
00:54:42.990 --> 00:54:44.790
people are always trying to marginalize things.
Like,

956
00:54:45.090 --> 00:54:48.310
did you ever see those videos that there's a really funny guy made with,
uh,

957
00:54:48.330 --> 00:54:49.790
Sarah Palin's,
uh,

958
00:54:49.900 --> 00:54:52.650
the people waiting in line for a book signing a Sarah Palin and he's

959
00:54:52.651 --> 00:54:57.150
interviewing them and my one in Columbus,
Ohio,
and they're all almost retarded.

960
00:54:57.360 --> 00:55:00.840
You know,
they'll have no idea what she stands for.

961
00:55:01.020 --> 00:55:05.320
They have no idea what's wrong with this country.
They'll know there's,
you know,

962
00:55:05.370 --> 00:55:06.360
they just,
they really,

963
00:55:06.390 --> 00:55:09.450
they're just that she's hooked into the cult of personality.

964
00:55:09.660 --> 00:55:13.800
So it's clip after clip of him interviewing these people and these people just

965
00:55:13.801 --> 00:55:15.240
being completely fucking clueless.

966
00:55:15.600 --> 00:55:19.500
And I've seen a few of those where people have done that about uh,
the,
uh,

967
00:55:19.770 --> 00:55:23.970
the occupy Wall Street movement where they sit down with some young kid and they

968
00:55:23.971 --> 00:55:27.360
take the kid and they,
you know,
they catch him on some facts and they,
you know,

969
00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:30.570
they show school.
I'm about corporate taxes.
You know,

970
00:55:30.571 --> 00:55:34.020
it was just like one snotty guy with an English accent.
It phones one dumb dude,

971
00:55:34.380 --> 00:55:36.930
but I can't believe that that's the only person you ran into.
Stupid.

972
00:55:37.050 --> 00:55:38.130
That's the video you made.

973
00:55:38.250 --> 00:55:42.420
You went down there and there's 100,000 people sleeping on the ground screaming

974
00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:46.590
at these fucking cunts and whores who've been ruining and poisoning our youth

975
00:55:46.740 --> 00:55:50.400
and our financial system.
And all you can find is this one guy.

976
00:55:50.430 --> 00:55:53.910
That's your depiction.
Yeah,
it's weird,
right?
They want to sabotage.

977
00:55:54.240 --> 00:55:59.190
Breitbart was down at occupy La,
you know,
Breitbart has,
he was down to occupy La.

978
00:55:59.191 --> 00:56:01.710
I was there with a friend of mine,
high Eq or Tim Heidecker.

979
00:56:01.711 --> 00:56:05.730
We went down there together and fucking,
I'm past Breitbart on the street,

980
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:08.220
you know,
it's,
you know,
Tim,
I decker is a Tim and Eric show

981
00:56:10.370 --> 00:56:11.890
and there's one of my favorite shows,

982
00:56:11.891 --> 00:56:15.100
but we're walking down the street and I only,
not a name drop.

983
00:56:15.101 --> 00:56:17.400
I'm only saying it because it's,
this seems really out of character.

984
00:56:17.401 --> 00:56:20.290
If you know that show walking down the street pass,

985
00:56:20.291 --> 00:56:24.220
fucking Breitbart and I decker,
I didn't even recognize

986
00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:28.510
<v 4>him.
Heidecker no hesitation.
It's like,
hey,
Breitbart,</v>

987
00:56:28.690 --> 00:56:32.350
you piece of fucking Shit.
Get the fuck out of here.

988
00:56:32.351 --> 00:56:34.840
You fucking piece of shit screaming.

989
00:56:34.841 --> 00:56:39.700
You're bright bar like instantaneously pissed.
Breitbart's like,
Yay.
Yeah.
Hi.

990
00:56:39.701 --> 00:56:43.480
That goes like you're dope.
You've capped it off with you dealt.
But it was,

991
00:56:43.690 --> 00:56:47.830
it was so awesome to see.
I'm like,
dude,
what the fuck?

992
00:56:48.010 --> 00:56:52.690
There was no filter.
It was like,
it was like when my dog sees a squirrel,

993
00:56:52.691 --> 00:56:55.990
it was just instantaneous.
You mother fucker.

994
00:56:56.050 --> 00:57:00.910
Why is Breitbart's such a piece of shit?
Well,
because he's a,
he's like,
um,
he,
uh,

995
00:57:00.940 --> 00:57:02.620
he slants his stories.

996
00:57:02.621 --> 00:57:07.120
He got in trouble recently because there's a black ladies in charge of some form

997
00:57:07.121 --> 00:57:11.680
of housing or something.
And like she,
uh,
I can't remember the exact thing,
but he,

998
00:57:11.681 --> 00:57:15.610
she was giving a speech and talking about how she was gay.

999
00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:18.610
There was a white family that needed some kind of financial help from this,

1000
00:57:18.660 --> 00:57:22.050
a white family that needed financial help from this organization.
And um,

1001
00:57:22.540 --> 00:57:26.200
she's like,
you know,
they're white and I didn't want to help him.

1002
00:57:26.620 --> 00:57:30.130
So that was the first,
remember that?
And then the next part is her being like,

1003
00:57:30.131 --> 00:57:32.530
but then I realized I should help them,

1004
00:57:32.770 --> 00:57:37.090
but Breitbart only puts up the part where she's like,
seemingly are racist.

1005
00:57:37.300 --> 00:57:41.850
That gets her fucking fired.
Uh,
and then they tried to rehire,

1006
00:57:41.860 --> 00:57:43.210
but she wouldn't go back.
She's like,

1007
00:57:43.211 --> 00:57:47.890
fuck you if you're going to fire me for some bullshit that Breitbart pissed off,

1008
00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:49.510
put pissed up on the Internet.

1009
00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:55.180
<v 0>You actually said was that she realized that,
you know,
there's the,</v>

1010
00:57:55.310 --> 00:57:59.740
you know,
that it's not about who's black,
who's white.
It's about who needs,

1011
00:58:00.070 --> 00:58:02.830
who needs help.
Yeah.
That was her.
It was like a lesson.

1012
00:58:02.831 --> 00:58:05.480
Like she was talking about how when she was younger or you know,

1013
00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:07.570
earlier in her life how she thought about things,

1014
00:58:07.571 --> 00:58:09.010
but now she realized differently.

1015
00:58:09.310 --> 00:58:12.280
She was just talking about growing as a human being.
Yeah.
You know what I mean?

1016
00:58:12.281 --> 00:58:13.810
What if you don't start off perfect?

1017
00:58:13.811 --> 00:58:15.640
You have to shoot yourself in the fucking head.
Right.
You know,

1018
00:58:15.641 --> 00:58:18.790
you can't have ever been a racist when you were younger or said racist things

1019
00:58:18.791 --> 00:58:22.450
cause you were,
and being insensitive or dumb or conditioned by your environment.

1020
00:58:22.840 --> 00:58:26.050
You know the,
the idea that people can't,
can't grow as gross,

1021
00:58:26.230 --> 00:58:30.670
<v 4>but then that Mollusk Breitbart,
that human fucking slime,</v>

1022
00:58:30.820 --> 00:58:35.380
he like feels okay it cre,
that's,
that's just creating evil.

1023
00:58:35.530 --> 00:58:39.280
That's like,
to me that's a,
if you want to believe in evil,
Bro,
that guy,

1024
00:58:39.281 --> 00:58:44.281
Breitbart is like an example of that where you can rationalize showing a skewed

1025
00:58:45.310 --> 00:58:47.860
depiction of something that you've intentionally put up there.

1026
00:58:47.861 --> 00:58:52.000
I seemingly intentionally put up there to fuck someone over and to try to push

1027
00:58:52.001 --> 00:58:53.130
your agenda had.
Yeah.

1028
00:58:53.240 --> 00:58:57.200
<v 0>Which is,
that's just basic internet journalism.
I mean the Internet,</v>

1029
00:58:57.230 --> 00:59:01.280
I mean that that's what you do.
You,
you take a section of something,
put a dot,

1030
00:59:01.281 --> 00:59:02.560
dot,
dot.
Don't,
you know,

1031
00:59:02.630 --> 00:59:06.980
take it out of context and you could put it on an article and have that be

1032
00:59:06.981 --> 00:59:09.960
something that someone finds and then they'll read your stupid site.
Right.

1033
00:59:10.010 --> 00:59:11.490
It's let's help people do it.
Yeah.

1034
00:59:11.510 --> 00:59:14.480
You do that in then may reporting they do it in everything,
man.
Well,

1035
00:59:14.510 --> 00:59:17.570
that's fucked up.
It's bad and it's worse.
It's fucked up.
But it's,
it's,

1036
00:59:17.630 --> 00:59:19.140
that's how it's done,
you know?

1037
00:59:19.380 --> 00:59:22.310
<v 4>Right.
I mean,
that's the problem.
You watch a fucking news.</v>

1038
00:59:22.460 --> 00:59:26.180
<v 3>What he's doing though,
I mean in the,
in that,
in that one situation,
you know,</v>

1039
00:59:26.360 --> 00:59:30.260
what he's doing is,
you know,
it's especially sleazy because he's,
you know,

1040
00:59:30.290 --> 00:59:35.290
someone exposed themselves to him in a really introspective way where she was

1041
00:59:35.451 --> 00:59:38.960
honest about her own shortcomings and you know,

1042
00:59:38.961 --> 00:59:42.530
and realize the right thing to do and did the right thing.
So when,

1043
00:59:42.531 --> 00:59:46.760
when someone exposes themselves like that and sort of does it in a way where

1044
00:59:46.761 --> 00:59:49.930
they're trying to,
you know,
let you know how,
you know,
they,

1045
00:59:49.931 --> 00:59:52.550
they think in a better way and then that's the right way to think.

1046
00:59:52.700 --> 00:59:55.420
And then you just take a little snippet of that and make them look at your cunt.

1047
00:59:55.460 --> 00:59:58.250
Yeah.
Like that's it.
That's as a shitty human move.

1048
00:59:58.280 --> 00:59:59.960
That's a shame thing for a human to,

1049
01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:02.790
<v 4>well,
he's a tarantula and he's like,
he's the,</v>

1050
01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:07.200
the fact that people like that are allowed to carry on the fact that people like

1051
01:00:07.201 --> 01:00:12.201
that are allowed to continue to spread their poison and wise and Phil throughout

1052
01:00:12.241 --> 01:00:16.530
the world with without anyone doing anything to stop it.
Like fucking Glenn Beck.

1053
01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:18.450
Did you see that quote by Glen Beck?

1054
01:00:18.451 --> 01:00:23.190
Sang The occupy Wall Street protesters are gonna like drag you out of here homes

1055
01:00:23.191 --> 01:00:26.890
or something?
Yeah.
Was it was people were tweeting.
It was on,
um,
well,

1056
01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:31.310
<v 3>well listen,
they will was right.
He's right.</v>

1057
01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:32.900
You think they find a banker's house?

1058
01:00:33.050 --> 01:00:36.110
You think when they get a fucking giant group of them and there's one con that

1059
01:00:36.111 --> 01:00:40.290
got $100 million in the bailout and he got his,
his,
his giant,
you know,

1060
01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:42.050
parachute reward for whatever,

1061
01:00:42.051 --> 01:00:46.100
for fucking over x amount of people and they know he's right behind some dates

1062
01:00:46.101 --> 01:00:49.190
in new haven,
Connecticut or wherever the fuck they'd be,
I guess Bridgeport.

1063
01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:51.800
That's where all the rich people live,
dude.
Yeah.

1064
01:00:52.010 --> 01:00:54.350
People are going to go after that guy.
Of course they are.

1065
01:00:54.351 --> 01:00:57.350
I think it was a mob man.
This is a mob.
They're not going to,

1066
01:00:57.351 --> 01:00:59.280
it's not a bad thing.
It's not a bad

1067
01:00:59.490 --> 01:01:03.450
<v 4>way too many drum circles and that mob to be dragging bankers out of their
hands.</v>

1068
01:01:03.451 --> 01:01:04.284
And a lot of them are.

1069
01:01:04.990 --> 01:01:09.270
<v 3>You say that you say that,
but look,
no one's doing anything violent.</v>

1070
01:01:09.271 --> 01:01:11.120
And I'm not accusing anyone to do anything violent,

1071
01:01:11.121 --> 01:01:15.950
but I am saying is that if there was one guy's house and you knew that this one

1072
01:01:15.951 --> 01:01:20.660
guy was responsible for a lot of evil fucking shit and a lot of people lost

1073
01:01:20.661 --> 01:01:23.900
their homes and a lot of people became homeless and a lot of people lost their

1074
01:01:23.901 --> 01:01:26.030
life savings and 11,
this guy is

1075
01:01:26.550 --> 01:01:28.740
<v 4>spring.
Are you talking about the president?</v>

1076
01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:33.000
Are you talking about the White House?
No,

1077
01:01:33.001 --> 01:01:36.390
I'm talking about better the people who pay the White House.
Right?
Yeah.
Yeah.

1078
01:01:36.660 --> 01:01:40.360
Well,
you know,
man,
I don't know.
I think that the,
um,
the,

1079
01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:44.650
you definitely have got to it some point.
If you really do want to,
uh,

1080
01:01:44.670 --> 01:01:47.160
have a revolution,
you're going to have to,
you know,

1081
01:01:47.161 --> 01:01:50.770
maybe do a little dragon out of houses here and there.
But exactly know,
like if,

1082
01:01:50.910 --> 01:01:53.970
if that is what you want,
I just think that we're,
I don't know that this is,

1083
01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:57.660
but I dunno.
I mean the crowd psychology,
it really could spread.

1084
01:01:57.661 --> 01:02:02.430
And perhaps that's the weird thing about this kind of my like very tiny little,

1085
01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:06.390
well in the grand scheme of things,
a,
the very,
very first spark of revolution,

1086
01:02:06.391 --> 01:02:09.350
we're seeing the spark of revolution.
We're seeing a fatigue.

1087
01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:11.310
It's a spark that boy,
if fire freedom,

1088
01:02:11.311 --> 01:02:15.720
it's a fire that springs up when people are being oppressed and it's a beautiful

1089
01:02:15.721 --> 01:02:18.900
thing to see.
It's a beautiful type of fire and it's a very dangerous type of,

1090
01:02:19.170 --> 01:02:19.980
and it's killed

1091
01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:24.780
<v 1>millions of people through throughout time.
Um,
but you know,
when you see,</v>

1092
01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:29.190
when you see the very first spark of it like that or anything,
Holy Shit,

1093
01:02:29.820 --> 01:02:32.370
there could be living among us right now.

1094
01:02:32.970 --> 01:02:35.490
The future is equivalent of like George Washington.

1095
01:02:35.820 --> 01:02:40.080
There could be the right now living among us,
the first post revolution leader.

1096
01:02:40.410 --> 01:02:42.790
You know what I mean?
There could be someone right now if,

1097
01:02:42.890 --> 01:02:44.970
if this shit's spread and there was a coupon,

1098
01:02:44.990 --> 01:02:46.530
you don't want to put that thought out there.

1099
01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:49.440
The called the personality and some wacky motherfucker thinks he's going to be

1100
01:02:49.441 --> 01:02:52.980
the next Jesus.
Oh,
that was runs this whole thing.
But you all,

1101
01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:56.400
the beautiful thing about this whole pro occupy Wall Street is there's no
leader.

1102
01:02:56.460 --> 01:03:00.060
That's the beautiful thing.
This is a hive mind conclusion.
It's way better.

1103
01:03:00.061 --> 01:03:01.800
This way.
Your idea sucks.

1104
01:03:02.010 --> 01:03:06.840
The idea of having one new George Washington con Shithead,
listen,
fuck.

1105
01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:10.080
All those leaders don't need leaders.
We all know what's right.

1106
01:03:10.110 --> 01:03:12.630
We all know what's right and what's right is it.
This system sucks.

1107
01:03:12.810 --> 01:03:14.460
Once the system gets broken down,

1108
01:03:14.490 --> 01:03:19.320
then they need to come up with a new lease show.
Rise to power.
Listen to me,

1109
01:03:19.710 --> 01:03:22.890
take the throne they need.
Um,

1110
01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:26.670
they need someone who's interest coming.
Someone who's done a lot of mushrooms,

1111
01:03:26.850 --> 01:03:29.370
that's what they need.
Yeah,
sure.
Well they need a group of people.

1112
01:03:29.371 --> 01:03:31.660
You got to what?
Because yeah,
of course.
It's fun.

1113
01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:34.350
Here's the fun thing to think about it.
It's fun to think about.
Okay,

1114
01:03:34.650 --> 01:03:39.240
let's say that Obama and the entire government get their feelings hurt by occupy

1115
01:03:39.241 --> 01:03:43.530
Wall Street and they're like,
all right,
you guys,
here are the keys.
Come on in.

1116
01:03:43.740 --> 01:03:47.550
We're on the show and you are one of the people that gets picked.
What do you do?

1117
01:03:47.790 --> 01:03:52.200
How do you redo things?
What are the steps you take to reduce redo things?

1118
01:03:52.201 --> 01:03:53.760
Do you you get rid of the Federal Reserve?

1119
01:03:53.761 --> 01:03:57.780
I guess that's the first thing would be like saying here cleanout Ted Bundys car

1120
01:03:57.781 --> 01:04:01.680
and you can drive it.
That's what that would be like though.

1121
01:04:01.681 --> 01:04:04.890
Why would you want to take over this crazy fucking org?

1122
01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:07.200
This organization that has deep,

1123
01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:11.090
deep roots in criminal behavior and murder all over the globe.
Yeah,

1124
01:04:11.091 --> 01:04:13.920
but if you're just going to take over and what you're going to make everything,

1125
01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:14.330
oh,

1126
01:04:14.330 --> 01:04:18.300
instead we're going to drop lollipops and flowers on everybody and pull out of

1127
01:04:18.301 --> 01:04:20.250
all,
what are you going to do though?
You wouldn't even,

1128
01:04:20.251 --> 01:04:22.860
how the fuck you remember you were talking about starcraft,
you,

1129
01:04:22.900 --> 01:04:23.880
you're talking about all different things.

1130
01:04:23.881 --> 01:04:25.860
You have to manage and click on this and click on that.

1131
01:04:25.950 --> 01:04:29.610
Imagine trying to run the United States of America,

1132
01:04:29.850 --> 01:04:33.510
the military industrial complex,
and it's deep,
deep,

1133
01:04:33.511 --> 01:04:37.940
deep roots into the financial system and the CIA and the NSA.
And you know,

1134
01:04:38.190 --> 01:04:40.920
the fact that the CIA is essentially a shadow government,

1135
01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:44.670
a government inside the government that does everything,
including murder people.

1136
01:04:45.170 --> 01:04:48.690
So it's funny,
it's all of that.
It's like you try to take over this.

1137
01:04:48.691 --> 01:04:51.330
That's what I'm saying.
How could you,
so what's the answer?
Well,

1138
01:04:51.331 --> 01:04:53.160
the answer is you would never get,
first of all,

1139
01:04:53.161 --> 01:04:54.990
you can't have access to all the fucking top.

1140
01:04:54.991 --> 01:04:57.750
So you get information until you become the president.
Right.
And even then,

1141
01:04:57.870 --> 01:05:00.300
we don't know what the fuck they really tell you about.

1142
01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:03.180
So you would have to go there and then to learn everything that the American

1143
01:05:03.181 --> 01:05:06.290
public doesn't learn,
learn everything about what we're doing in Beirut.

1144
01:05:06.291 --> 01:05:08.220
They're going to,
if everything about what we're doing in Israel,

1145
01:05:08.221 --> 01:05:10.830
whatever went through everything that we've got going on in Pakistan,

1146
01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:13.080
you would have to fucking be abreast of all of it.

1147
01:05:13.260 --> 01:05:17.010
And that if you were really the leader,
you know,
or can even sing one liter.

1148
01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:18.100
I'm saying imagine

1149
01:05:18.130 --> 01:05:20.780
<v 0>if what I'm saying it's impossible to fix.
I'm saying,</v>

1150
01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:24.040
you said what would you do when you go,
what?
So if it's impossible to fix,

1151
01:05:24.250 --> 01:05:29.020
then what's the next best solution?
It has to be an internet based system.

1152
01:05:29.170 --> 01:05:32.740
We have to have a system of government that's through the Internet because

1153
01:05:32.741 --> 01:05:34.630
through the engine that people can really communicate.

1154
01:05:34.810 --> 01:05:37.720
You could have civilizations and you can have communities on the inner,

1155
01:05:37.721 --> 01:05:39.550
I have a community,
the Rogan board,

1156
01:05:39.551 --> 01:05:43.600
it's a community on the Internet and we've established clear patterns of

1157
01:05:43.601 --> 01:05:45.610
behavior in that community.
And you know there's,

1158
01:05:45.611 --> 01:05:48.790
it's hard for any message board when you have a bunch of people to keep people

1159
01:05:48.791 --> 01:05:50.290
in line,
keep people cool.

1160
01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:54.580
But generally speaking that that message board is pretty filled with interesting

1161
01:05:54.581 --> 01:05:56.890
people.
Cool conversations.
And if you're a con,

1162
01:05:56.920 --> 01:06:00.380
they throw you in the retard room and there's a,
there's a,
there's a special tag.

1163
01:06:00.410 --> 01:06:02.830
An observatory.
Yeah,
the holding cell.

1164
01:06:02.831 --> 01:06:05.590
And then you get a pink name and you can only talk with the other assholes.

1165
01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:09.040
It's like all the assholes get lumped in together that did that as a community.

1166
01:06:09.070 --> 01:06:11.800
And that's a community where you have just a few people running in and the

1167
01:06:11.950 --> 01:06:14.890
people get upset that the few people that are running it or being too,
you know,

1168
01:06:14.891 --> 01:06:15.730
they're,
they're,
they're,
you know,

1169
01:06:15.790 --> 01:06:19.750
they're closing things down and yelling at people and abusing power and then you

1170
01:06:19.751 --> 01:06:23.500
have to scale things back and you have to make some sort of a happy medium,

1171
01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:24.970
a happy,
you know,

1172
01:06:24.971 --> 01:06:29.810
a happy community where everybody agrees and the only way to do that in,

1173
01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:31.660
in our world right now,

1174
01:06:31.661 --> 01:06:35.230
the thing that makes the most sense to me is the Internet because the internet

1175
01:06:35.231 --> 01:06:38.620
is a way that everybody has a fair shot of communicating who they are.

1176
01:06:39.180 --> 01:06:40.690
You have a fair shot of expressing yourself.

1177
01:06:40.691 --> 01:06:44.020
You have a fair shot at agreeing and disagreeing.
It's reddit system.

1178
01:06:44.021 --> 01:06:48.040
I think reddit figured it out with the upvote system.
It's some version of that.

1179
01:06:48.041 --> 01:06:49.740
Perfect.
Something like that.
Yeah,

1180
01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:53.260
that's very similar to what I was talking about.
Like having a message board,

1181
01:06:53.261 --> 01:06:56.860
having an online community,
you know,
real life communities.

1182
01:06:56.861 --> 01:06:58.690
Of course you've got to deal with a lot of different shit.
A lot.

1183
01:06:59.110 --> 01:07:00.400
It's a lot more complicated,

1184
01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:04.540
but I think the idea that we could run the world through the Internet is

1185
01:07:04.541 --> 01:07:08.860
eventually going to be some sort of a reality because we'll be able to how,

1186
01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:14.440
how,
how can you influence other countries?
How can you influence this country?

1187
01:07:14.441 --> 01:07:17.590
How can you influence large groups of people you gotta be able to communicate

1188
01:07:17.591 --> 01:07:21.580
with?
And there's no better tool of communication other than the Internet,

1189
01:07:21.610 --> 01:07:24.190
but don't you think we're still going to have a problem with like the same

1190
01:07:24.191 --> 01:07:27.520
reason why you look at like the middle of the country,

1191
01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:30.720
there's still going to be people voting for annoying orange.
You know,

1192
01:07:30.730 --> 01:07:33.880
in the stupid annoying videos where you see on youtube,
you're like,

1193
01:07:33.881 --> 01:07:37.770
how does that have 90,000 hits?
Who's watching this movie?
And so you have the,

1194
01:07:37.900 --> 01:07:40.730
the majority of the people,
you've gotta know what I mean?
Yeah,

1195
01:07:40.810 --> 01:07:44.170
I see what you're saying.
You know,
look,
the real issue is we're,

1196
01:07:44.250 --> 01:07:47.640
we're all trying to pretend that everyone's equal and everyone's on equal,
right?

1197
01:07:47.910 --> 01:07:50.950
They're just,
we're just not,
you know,
we're not equal of mind.

1198
01:07:50.951 --> 01:07:55.570
We're not equal of body.
We're not equal.
Of,
of chance or not equal of,
you know,

1199
01:07:55.690 --> 01:07:59.230
opportunities.
We're not,
it's just,
it's a random hodgepodge of human beings.

1200
01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:04.390
And because of that,
people are,
you know,
they're very hesitant to,

1201
01:08:04.391 --> 01:08:08.350
uh,
to admit that if you're going to make a really big important decision,

1202
01:08:09.130 --> 01:08:11.200
there's some people that shouldn't be included in that decision.

1203
01:08:11.230 --> 01:08:16.190
The fallacy being the majority is always right.
Right?
Yeah.
Especially in a

1204
01:08:16.190 --> 01:08:21.190
<v 3>country that's been baby fed like this motherfucker has for the last few</v>

1205
01:08:21.230 --> 01:08:24.620
decades.
We've been baby fed,
you know,
there's no fights here on our soil.

1206
01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:28.700
We get attacked once and we go apeshit create 10 wars with people that never

1207
01:08:28.701 --> 01:08:32.090
touched us and somehow justify the entire thing.
You know?
Meanwhile,

1208
01:08:32.091 --> 01:08:33.740
we were attacked by suicide bombers.
You know,

1209
01:08:33.741 --> 01:08:36.890
the people that attacked us are dead on impact,
right?

1210
01:08:36.891 --> 01:08:39.320
And yet we still branch out all over the glove.

1211
01:08:39.321 --> 01:08:43.490
But this is our one thing we've been baby fed our whole existence.

1212
01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:45.440
So for us,
yeah.

1213
01:08:45.570 --> 01:08:49.680
<v 4>So what?
So what?
So at some kind of like,
so the idea would be it's,
and I'm not,</v>

1214
01:08:49.710 --> 01:08:50.011
by the way,

1215
01:08:50.011 --> 01:08:53.160
I'm not expecting you to invent some new form of government right now on a

1216
01:08:53.161 --> 01:08:55.530
podcast,
but it's a fun thing to think about.
Like,
okay,

1217
01:08:55.650 --> 01:08:58.120
so it's like some kind of upvotes system.
Yeah.

1218
01:08:58.140 --> 01:09:02.590
But that's still implies a majority and a majority is still making the decision

1219
01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:05.300
<v 3>be hard.
It's always going to be hard.
You know,
there's no,</v>

1220
01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:10.070
there's no perfect way to do it,
but I think you can develop a good

1221
01:09:10.270 --> 01:09:15.250
<v 4>make,
make,
make the,
the voting system be really expensive.
What the fuck?</v>

1222
01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:20.170
Why would you do that?
That's ridiculous.
Make the voting to $50 he goes,

1223
01:09:20.171 --> 01:09:22.700
then you lost my train of thought because of that.
How dare you.
No,
no,

1224
01:09:22.890 --> 01:09:24.370
but what I'm saying is like,
you know,
the,

1225
01:09:24.371 --> 01:09:27.640
the dumber person doesn't have the high paying jobs,
so they can't know.

1226
01:09:27.641 --> 01:09:28.690
That's not true.
That's true.

1227
01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:31.840
There's a lot of fucking real idiots that are pretty right.

1228
01:09:32.330 --> 01:09:34.110
<v 3>Be Amazed at how business owners,
I've,</v>

1229
01:09:34.111 --> 01:09:37.330
I've had emails where business owners where they send me emails and I'm just

1230
01:09:37.331 --> 01:09:40.020
like,
you thought that's the spelling of that all right.
You know,

1231
01:09:40.021 --> 01:09:43.240
or what that fucking you,
you just got to you as like a hundred employees.

1232
01:09:43.270 --> 01:09:46.560
You know,
some people are just ambitious but they're idiots.
They're just fucking,

1233
01:09:47.580 --> 01:09:49.570
they figured out a way to bulldog their way through things,

1234
01:09:49.571 --> 01:09:52.630
but there's still stupid as fuck.
Like this Herman Cain,
Callan character,

1235
01:09:52.690 --> 01:09:56.260
<v 4>he's a bible believing Christian and as a bat to be,
who wants to be the king?</v>

1236
01:09:56.510 --> 01:09:58.480
Oh Dude,
let me tell you this.
I meant to,

1237
01:09:58.481 --> 01:10:00.130
I was going to tell you before the podcast,

1238
01:10:00.131 --> 01:10:04.870
so you know the Herman Cain has been quoting and man if you pull it up,

1239
01:10:04.871 --> 01:10:08.770
it's a funny cause sometimes in his speeches and like a couple of species is

1240
01:10:08.771 --> 01:10:13.771
like to a quota of special poet and he quotes Donna Summers.

1241
01:10:14.530 --> 01:10:15.460
He says it's a poet.

1242
01:10:15.461 --> 01:10:19.690
He quotes Donna Summers and what he's quoting is the theme song that she wrote

1243
01:10:19.691 --> 01:10:21.520
for a Po for the Pokemon movie.

1244
01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:22.730
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

1245
01:10:22.730 --> 01:10:27.730
<v 4>So Herman Cain is quoting Donna Summers from a Pokemon movie.</v>

1246
01:10:27.990 --> 01:10:31.880
Yes.
What is the message?
Can you look it up?
The thing it's,

1247
01:10:31.881 --> 01:10:36.440
it's not exactly,
it's not even like that smartest statement.
It's like stupid.

1248
01:10:36.770 --> 01:10:40.280
You can play the song.
You can look at,
if you look up the song on Youtube,

1249
01:10:40.550 --> 01:10:43.130
you'll find a video with like Pokemon dancing around.

1250
01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:44.620
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

1251
01:10:44.620 --> 01:10:48.770
<v 4>All right,
here it is.
I'm a poet.
Once said,
life can be a challenge.</v>

1252
01:10:48.830 --> 01:10:50.660
Life can seem impossible,

1253
01:10:50.810 --> 01:10:54.050
but it's never easy when there's so much on the line.

1254
01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:55.110
<v 7>Okay.</v>

1255
01:10:55.110 --> 01:10:58.470
<v 4>And then,
so I guess that's Donna Summers from the Pokemon movie</v>

1256
01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:02.110
<v 1>economic engine moving by putting fuel in the engine.</v>

1257
01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:04.250
All of the rest of it won't matter.

1258
01:11:04.910 --> 01:11:09.140
A poet once said life can be a challenge.
Life can seem impossible,

1259
01:11:09.141 --> 01:11:14.100
but it's never easy when there's so much on the line.
We have a lot now

1260
01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:14.993
<v 4>look up,</v>

1261
01:11:15.060 --> 01:11:18.870
look up Donna Summers Pokemon and play the musical version of what he quoted.

1262
01:11:19.730 --> 01:11:23.040
All right,
and do you know his tax plan?
You know about his tax plan,
right?

1263
01:11:23.310 --> 01:11:27.240
He wants to text 9% nine 909 is his tax plan.

1264
01:11:27.241 --> 01:11:31.920
And it's the same tax plan from Sim city.
Wow.
So he's like quoting,

1265
01:11:32.490 --> 01:11:37.490
he's quoting Pokemon and his economic system is based on Sim city.

1266
01:11:37.890 --> 01:11:40.590
Does he have kids and he's got grandkids.
That's what it is.

1267
01:11:41.010 --> 01:11:43.770
We're just sitting here going,
I like what he did.
She just said,

1268
01:11:43.771 --> 01:11:46.620
right now how am I going to do as a bible believing Christian,

1269
01:11:46.621 --> 01:11:50.160
what are some tenants?
Sim City worked for me.

1270
01:11:51.150 --> 01:11:52.200
It's amazing man.

1271
01:11:52.201 --> 01:11:56.190
And also the fact that he said that thing about the poet not knowing someone's

1272
01:11:56.191 --> 01:12:00.060
just going to do a simple Google search and the Pokemon theme is going to come

1273
01:12:00.061 --> 01:12:03.750
up.
Oh,
he probably is like maybe it's a pygmy employer and he thinks that's cool.

1274
01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:08.070
If he was a Pokemon player,
he would get my vote.
That would be awesome.
Yeah,

1275
01:12:08.100 --> 01:12:10.470
I would vote for him right away.
He played Pokemon,
but Joe,

1276
01:12:10.471 --> 01:12:13.110
the other thing I was telling Brian,
his tax plan,

1277
01:12:13.140 --> 01:12:18.140
Urban Kane's got this tax plan 9% 9% 9% nine but you know where that comes from,

1278
01:12:18.631 --> 01:12:22.820
right?
Sim City or a devil worshipers.
It's the same tech.

1279
01:12:23.190 --> 01:12:27.150
It's the same tax plan that using Sim city,
like eas,
eas,

1280
01:12:27.151 --> 01:12:31.500
really excited about it because it's their basic tax planning.
Look it up,

1281
01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:34.320
look up Herman Cain,
Sim city.
It's amazing.

1282
01:12:36.820 --> 01:12:39.940
<v 3>So he got his,
his plans from video games,</v>

1283
01:12:41.070 --> 01:12:45.760
<v 4>Pokemon in Sim city or two major influences on who may be the Republican</v>

1284
01:12:45.761 --> 01:12:46.880
presidential candidate,

1285
01:12:47.890 --> 01:12:52.840
<v 3>a guy they're moving into position to take the black people away from Obama to</v>

1286
01:12:52.841 --> 01:12:57.070
black people going to have a,
you know,
a a different alternative to,
you know,

1287
01:12:57.071 --> 01:12:58.870
to support someone that's intelligent.

1288
01:12:58.871 --> 01:13:02.260
And I mean they went through an amazing time.
First first black president ever.

1289
01:13:02.261 --> 01:13:06.130
Incredibly articulate and intelligent.
But now you know,

1290
01:13:06.250 --> 01:13:09.580
most people in this country or disappointed with Obama,

1291
01:13:09.581 --> 01:13:11.890
they say his approval rate is some ridiculously low,

1292
01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:15.430
like 30% or something asshole.
So that's 70% of the people.

1293
01:13:15.431 --> 01:13:17.340
That's a lot of black people out there.
They're disenfranchised.

1294
01:13:17.380 --> 01:13:21.100
And their idea is to use is Herman Cain guy and go look at this.

1295
01:13:21.101 --> 01:13:21.550
We've got enough.

1296
01:13:21.550 --> 01:13:25.960
We've got a very intelligent hard nose guy who's super successful,

1297
01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:30.700
made his way to pizza all on his own.
Yeah,
business owner.

1298
01:13:30.730 --> 01:13:31.680
He owns godfathers beat.

1299
01:13:31.890 --> 01:13:35.820
<v 4>Are you serious?
Yeah,
I am voting for this guy.
That's the best pizza ever.
Shit.</v>

1300
01:13:35.821 --> 01:13:40.230
Godfather's pizza you need if you want to retard bread.
Seriously?

1301
01:13:40.260 --> 01:13:43.640
Did you guys have godfathers growing up though?
No.
Oh,
it's delicious.
Yes,

1302
01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:48.660
<v 3>dude.
I had Nikki's pizza in white plains in New York.</v>

1303
01:13:48.900 --> 01:13:51.660
There's right down from executive billiards is the best fucking pizza on the

1304
01:13:51.661 --> 01:13:54.300
planet.
You got to have real east coast pizza.

1305
01:13:54.330 --> 01:13:58.360
The water's different pizza out here.
It's just not the same taste.
Good.

1306
01:13:58.361 --> 01:14:00.570
It tastes pretty good here.
I had a friend still good.

1307
01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:02.760
I had a friend who would order pizzas from New York

1308
01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:07.710
<v 4>and there's like special services that will rush pizzas that are like on dry ice</v>

1309
01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:12.130
from New York.
TTU whoa.
He so he ordered one of these pieces that was terrible.

1310
01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:15.100
<v 1>There's places in Los Angeles that I shipped the water.
Yeah,</v>

1311
01:14:15.190 --> 01:14:18.400
I think Boston pizza does that.
Dalton ship shipping from Boston.

1312
01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:22.060
Isn't that weird?
That there's water?
There's a difference in the water.
Yeah,

1313
01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:25.570
it is weird.
Yeah.
What the fuck is the difference?
I didn't know as the water,

1314
01:14:25.571 --> 01:14:27.100
I thought it was something else like that.

1315
01:14:28.620 --> 01:14:32.190
They say bagels are no good out here either.
Really?
Yeah.

1316
01:14:32.710 --> 01:14:35.160
It could be moisture in the air too.
Could be a lot of things.

1317
01:14:35.161 --> 01:14:38.770
Flora and probably not so fucking good to be living in an oven like this.

1318
01:14:38.830 --> 01:14:42.520
No moisture in the air.
You know whenever you go to like Houston in July you go,

1319
01:14:42.580 --> 01:14:47.260
Oh wow,
this is what it's like to be in wet air.
Wet,
damp air.
Well,

1320
01:14:47.261 --> 01:14:47.801
I'll tell you this,

1321
01:14:47.801 --> 01:14:51.700
if you didn't know anything about the planet and someone like flu you around the

1322
01:14:51.701 --> 01:14:54.130
planet and said,
where do you want to live?
You're not going to be like,
Hey,

1323
01:14:54.910 --> 01:14:57.220
what's under that giant yellow?
He cloud is smog.

1324
01:14:57.310 --> 01:15:02.310
I think I want to live there at that over overpopulated thing festering with

1325
01:15:02.351 --> 01:15:04.100
yellow smog.
Let's live there.
I don't,

1326
01:15:04.350 --> 01:15:06.190
I don't want to live around all this green shit.

1327
01:15:06.250 --> 01:15:07.800
Well that has nothing to do with the climate anyway.

1328
01:15:07.810 --> 01:15:11.100
I mean if people aren't living swimming anyway,
people are living here for,
um,

1329
01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:12.580
for the industry.

1330
01:15:12.670 --> 01:15:15.790
That's why you live in the industries here because there's not that many,
uh,

1331
01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:19.390
rainy days.
That's why they first moved the movie business here.
They're like,

1332
01:15:19.391 --> 01:15:22.590
Jesus,
we've got this one spot where it never gets ridiculously high.

1333
01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:26.980
Like Phoenix gets stupid hot.
Phoenix cracks it up even more than La.

1334
01:15:26.981 --> 01:15:29.110
So it's like a little bit cooler than Phoenix.

1335
01:15:29.111 --> 01:15:33.490
It's by the ocean and it never rains.
Okay,
thank you.
That fucking ocean.

1336
01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:38.560
Once I went down to Venice beach and a whim and went swimming and Venice beach,

1337
01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:43.480
I was pissing out of my asshole man.
I got so sick from swimming.

1338
01:15:43.780 --> 01:15:46.540
There are people swimming there that people at Venice beach floating in the

1339
01:15:46.541 --> 01:15:50.440
waves having a great time.
I'd fucking diapers floating by.

1340
01:15:51.100 --> 01:15:54.940
Really?
Yeah.
It's filthy water.
I'm an idiot for swimming in it,
but it's like,

1341
01:15:54.941 --> 01:15:55.721
it's disgusting.

1342
01:15:55.721 --> 01:15:58.750
Not to mention they do these like measurements of the amount of feces and the

1343
01:15:58.751 --> 01:16:01.480
sand is cause it's,
it's,
you know,

1344
01:16:01.481 --> 01:16:05.590
it's a beach at the edge of like a s a a massive city.

1345
01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:07.780
Homeless water runs in there.

1346
01:16:07.781 --> 01:16:11.500
All the fucking chemicals and God knows what Weird Shit.

1347
01:16:11.501 --> 01:16:16.501
Old fucking decomposing hookers and just nasty shit rushing out of the city.

1348
01:16:17.650 --> 01:16:20.830
Dead Rats and fucking hypodermic needles.

1349
01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:24.430
I'm surprised people swimming at Venice beach don't just immediately dissolve in

1350
01:16:24.431 --> 01:16:28.150
the water.
It's disgusting.
Probably good for your immune system swim there.

1351
01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:30.850
It's like a challenge.
It's like lifting weights for your immune system

1352
01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:35.110
and you did it all the time.
You'd probably never get sick.

1353
01:16:35.530 --> 01:16:39.640
You can just go and swim anywhere,
man.
You would get you,
oh,
maybe.
I don't know.

1354
01:16:39.641 --> 01:16:42.070
I think it's,
you got to go up the coast anyway.

1355
01:16:42.071 --> 01:16:43.510
If you're going to go out in the water around here,

1356
01:16:43.511 --> 01:16:45.790
you have to like get away from population density.

1357
01:16:45.940 --> 01:16:48.580
What do you want to think about that garbage patch situation?

1358
01:16:48.940 --> 01:16:51.240
That's a scary thing.
Oh yeah.
What's that passion?

1359
01:16:51.260 --> 01:16:52.370
The middle of the Pacific Ocean.

1360
01:16:52.390 --> 01:16:55.690
I think that there's more than one guy or whatever they call or they call it the

1361
01:16:55.691 --> 01:17:00.100
North Atlantic gyre guyers and there's a weird name for it.
This is just dead,

1362
01:17:00.610 --> 01:17:03.210
just dead water and nothing's living in it.
She's like,
no,

1363
01:17:03.340 --> 01:17:06.290
I'm talking about the garbage patch.
They'd go,
yeah,
the fucking,

1364
01:17:06.291 --> 01:17:08.860
they have a weird name for it.
Like the north,
there's a name for it called,

1365
01:17:08.861 --> 01:17:09.900
they call it a gyres.

1366
01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:10.680
<v 4>I Dunno.</v>

1367
01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:10.890
<v 0>Look,</v>

1368
01:17:10.890 --> 01:17:14.250
I'm talking about where all the garbage from all the different countries pools

1369
01:17:14.251 --> 01:17:16.980
up into Warren.
I know.
And it's all swirled together.

1370
01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:22.020
It's like rubber duckies or is a different thing with dead dead water.

1371
01:17:22.021 --> 01:17:25.430
Like they've had like mass fish die offs and like,
oh no,
I was happening.

1372
01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:28.500
We're talking about,
okay.
We are,
okay.

1373
01:17:28.650 --> 01:17:32.720
So when we're talking about is this big slick of uh,
I mean not even,

1374
01:17:32.740 --> 01:17:36.120
it goes below the surface,
deep below surface of plastic.
It's like,

1375
01:17:36.340 --> 01:17:38.700
like the size of a state.
Like it's enormous.

1376
01:17:38.701 --> 01:17:43.440
It's like Texas sized and it's just the one spot where in a lot of it is like

1377
01:17:43.441 --> 01:17:45.240
broken down because apparently they're like,
it's like,

1378
01:17:45.241 --> 01:17:48.990
it's a lot of it is plastic and after a long time in the ocean,

1379
01:17:48.991 --> 01:17:53.991
all this plastic is broken down to just like this Google lobby fucking shit man.

1380
01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:58.350
And it's an enormous area that is covered in garbage.
Yeah.

1381
01:17:58.410 --> 01:18:01.680
The people who were discovering it with the people who discovered this and then

1382
01:18:01.681 --> 01:18:04.740
the people who have been investigating it,
the scientists were horrified,

1383
01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:08.460
you know,
I mean,
what a,
what a crazy discovery to find out that,
you know,

1384
01:18:08.461 --> 01:18:08.911
when you go,

1385
01:18:08.911 --> 01:18:11.640
well these people are living right next to the ocean and the ocean seems to be

1386
01:18:11.641 --> 01:18:16.050
okay.
No the fuck it does.
No,
there's giant patches.

1387
01:18:16.410 --> 01:18:18.870
All People's bullshit that they've thrown in there.

1388
01:18:19.010 --> 01:18:23.630
<v 4>Yeah.
Just rolls in in the middle.
I might my um,
and no way to fix it either.</v>

1389
01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:25.760
It my,
uh,
my um,

1390
01:18:26.090 --> 01:18:30.380
my mom has some property on this little island off the coast of Georgia and it's

1391
01:18:30.381 --> 01:18:33.560
like kind of like empty out their ally.
Ally,

1392
01:18:33.890 --> 01:18:36.260
you go walking on the beach there because no one's there you go walking on the

1393
01:18:36.261 --> 01:18:41.060
beach there and the shit that comes up on that beach,
it's like,
dude,

1394
01:18:41.061 --> 01:18:45.830
it's the weirdest fucking thing cause it's like bottles from Jamaica in like,

1395
01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:46.941
like there was,

1396
01:18:46.941 --> 01:18:50.870
we found like one of those old like refugee rafts that somebody had like

1397
01:18:50.871 --> 01:18:54.170
fabricated together just kind of twisted and washed up there.

1398
01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:59.440
It's so fucking weird how interconnected everything is via the ocean.

1399
01:19:00.231 --> 01:19:03.080
It's really,
really strange that the current,

1400
01:19:03.081 --> 01:19:06.620
she's Carrie like coconuts and it's fucking,

1401
01:19:06.650 --> 01:19:09.560
it's crazy and it's like people,

1402
01:19:10.090 --> 01:19:14.330
I love to live under the illusion that we're not all connected.

1403
01:19:14.690 --> 01:19:17.450
That's one of the things that people really like to believe,

1404
01:19:17.451 --> 01:19:22.451
that there's no interrelation between what you do in the rest of the world and

1405
01:19:24.411 --> 01:19:27.860
what the rest of the world does and you when the truth of the matter is we're

1406
01:19:27.861 --> 01:19:31.520
completely connected in every single fucking way.

1407
01:19:31.910 --> 01:19:36.660
We're all one big thing pretending that it's an end.

1408
01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:37.060
It's,

1409
01:19:37.060 --> 01:19:41.390
it's made up of individuals and the result of that kind of thinking is you get

1410
01:19:41.391 --> 01:19:43.280
fucking a giant patch,

1411
01:19:43.281 --> 01:19:47.430
a dead water in the middle of the ocean and like that's not if,

1412
01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:51.380
and then like that's not affecting other things.
God knows what that's affecting.

1413
01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:56.120
The like having that much dead space that used to be alive and filled with fish

1414
01:19:56.121 --> 01:20:00.530
and dolphins and whales and God knows what else.
She's dead space.

1415
01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:02.450
<v 0>I use this quote in the last podcast,</v>

1416
01:20:02.451 --> 01:20:05.630
but I'll say it again because you're here because it's the perfect quote.

1417
01:20:05.631 --> 01:20:09.690
Some guy said that the human race and the way it deals with the environment and

1418
01:20:09.691 --> 01:20:13.800
the resources is like people that are living in a 10 story building and every

1419
01:20:13.801 --> 01:20:17.850
day you go down to the first floor and you pull a couple bricks out and then you

1420
01:20:17.851 --> 01:20:22.680
get on the roof and you start building another floor.
Okay.
For now,

1421
01:20:22.770 --> 01:20:25.920
but we all know that eventually it's going to fall apart.

1422
01:20:25.950 --> 01:20:26.810
They shit isn't going to work.

1423
01:20:31.950 --> 01:20:35.370
Well,
he's never going to be president.
That's a choke candidate.

1424
01:20:35.450 --> 01:20:39.750
It's like Sarah Palin entertainment candidate.
Yeah,
well he's talking crazy.

1425
01:20:40.020 --> 01:20:43.950
You know when,
when you,
when you started talking about his is seven,
seven,
nine,

1426
01:20:43.951 --> 01:20:46.340
nine,
nine,
whatever the fuck it is,
tax plan,
that's just,

1427
01:20:46.750 --> 01:20:48.600
everyone looks at that and goes,
get the fuck outta here.

1428
01:20:48.601 --> 01:20:52.260
It's going to cost people more money.
It's going to cost the 99% more money.

1429
01:20:52.290 --> 01:20:55.050
What about the one,
this is a stupid,
they're going to save money.

1430
01:20:55.530 --> 01:20:57.700
The 1% are going to pay less.
You know,
you're,

1431
01:20:57.701 --> 01:21:00.990
you're supposed to pay more than 9% taxes when you got billions of dollars,
man,

1432
01:21:01.350 --> 01:21:02.250
the fuck Outta here.

1433
01:21:02.550 --> 01:21:04.400
<v 4>Time to move to Canada.</v>

1434
01:21:06.940 --> 01:21:10.990
<v 0>This guy is a,
a real like no nonsense sort of,
uh,</v>

1435
01:21:11.590 --> 01:21:13.510
extremist character,
right?

1436
01:21:13.810 --> 01:21:14.940
<v 4>You gotta be extreme and athlete.</v>

1437
01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:19.460
That's another funny thing is like people right now that's,
that's a uh,

1438
01:21:19.810 --> 01:21:21.220
um,
insult.

1439
01:21:21.250 --> 01:21:23.310
That's what they say when they're trying to discredit some of their [inaudible].

1440
01:21:23.410 --> 01:21:25.000
He's an extremist,
but it's like,

1441
01:21:25.300 --> 01:21:30.300
it's a fireman that's in a house with a sledgehammer bashing down doors to get

1442
01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:34.420
your kids to pull him out because the house is on fire.
That's an extreme is too,

1443
01:21:34.630 --> 01:21:37.300
he's got to be a fucking extreme as he can't go into the house and kind of

1444
01:21:37.301 --> 01:21:41.680
piddle around and be like,
oh,
see I watch watching TV and then I'll go get you.

1445
01:21:41.740 --> 01:21:43.740
Get your,
your daughters.
I was part of what is your point?

1446
01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:47.890
My point is that right now the overpopulation,

1447
01:21:48.070 --> 01:21:49.850
the fact that um,

1448
01:21:50.020 --> 01:21:54.040
there's so many people on the planet and that there's horrific wars happening.

1449
01:21:54.041 --> 01:21:58.450
People have nuclear weapons.
Maybe it's a time where people need to be extremist.

1450
01:21:58.630 --> 01:22:02.380
Maybe you need to be Herman Cain.
Oh No,
not until you're talking about though.

1451
01:22:02.381 --> 01:22:04.810
I thought you were talking about the guy who gave you that awesome quote about

1452
01:22:04.811 --> 01:22:06.370
taking breaks out from under the house.

1453
01:22:06.940 --> 01:22:11.580
<v 0>Oh,
okay man.
Sorry,
I got a lot.
I don't know what you're saying.</v>

1454
01:22:11.590 --> 01:22:15.070
You're like,
suddenly I'd become,
suddenly I'd become a supporter of Herman.

1455
01:22:15.080 --> 01:22:18.470
Cain didn't understand.
I thought you were being need cane.

1456
01:22:20.970 --> 01:22:23.700
No,
I'm sorry I got confused.
Yeah.
Well,
yeah,

1457
01:22:23.710 --> 01:22:25.990
we certainly need something different than now.

1458
01:22:26.100 --> 01:22:28.750
And You keep saying look like as if there's a leader.

1459
01:22:29.020 --> 01:22:31.750
If there's one person that's going to pull it off.
And I keep saying that.

1460
01:22:31.751 --> 01:22:35.050
I think that's one of the coolest things about this whole occupy Wall Street

1461
01:22:35.051 --> 01:22:37.600
thing is cause I don't think there's a fucking leader.
You know,

1462
01:22:37.601 --> 01:22:38.171
there's no leader.

1463
01:22:38.171 --> 01:22:40.900
You can't arrest one person and then the whole thing shuts down.

1464
01:22:40.901 --> 01:22:43.660
There's not one figurehead.
There's not one voice.
You know,

1465
01:22:43.670 --> 01:22:47.950
I've heard Janine Garafalo talking about it,
but you know,
she's not the voice.

1466
01:22:47.951 --> 01:22:51.510
Who's the voice?
There's no voice.
I don't know.
I mean,
people

1467
01:22:51.510 --> 01:22:53.670
<v 4>who've got like really smart,
they're these got,</v>

1468
01:22:53.671 --> 01:22:55.710
when I went down to occupy Wall Street there,

1469
01:22:55.711 --> 01:22:59.580
these guys who have a podcast called red list or radio and they like,

1470
01:22:59.820 --> 01:23:04.410
they've like really explained a lot of shit about the Federal Reserve and

1471
01:23:04.411 --> 01:23:08.830
quantitative to me in a way that like really helped me understand it.
So I don't,

1472
01:23:08.831 --> 01:23:11.980
I'm not saying it needs some central leader,
but I think it,
it definitely,

1473
01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:16.260
it can't hurt to have some like nodes that are,
you know,

1474
01:23:17.290 --> 01:23:20.470
aggregators of whatever the information coming at is,

1475
01:23:20.471 --> 01:23:22.030
which we already kind of have with like reddit.

1476
01:23:22.270 --> 01:23:26.260
You can go and read it and get good up to date information on ows and stuff.

1477
01:23:26.261 --> 01:23:27.760
But I think it's evolving.

1478
01:23:27.910 --> 01:23:31.390
I think it's going to evolve into something and eventually there will be,

1479
01:23:31.990 --> 01:23:36.850
there's gotta be someone if you don't want it to just be a chaotic mass,

1480
01:23:36.851 --> 01:23:40.330
unless you believe that there's some kind of gestalt that's going to happen with

1481
01:23:40.331 --> 01:23:44.770
this group of people that's going to somehow harmonize and create some kind of
a,

1482
01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:47.500
there's going to be an uh,
an uh,
an effect,

1483
01:23:47.740 --> 01:23:52.210
some kind of weird effect from all this.
Uh,
all these people,
you know,

1484
01:23:52.211 --> 01:23:54.520
having sort of the same idea then cool.

1485
01:23:54.521 --> 01:23:56.620
But someone's got is someone still has to be like,

1486
01:23:56.980 --> 01:23:59.950
here's what we'd like to see changed,
here's what we want to have happen.

1487
01:24:00.430 --> 01:24:03.280
And they are doing that.
They're saying,
you know,
abolish the Federal Reserve.

1488
01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:07.840
That's one of the things they want to have happen.
They want to tax,

1489
01:24:07.841 --> 01:24:09.130
well there's different versions of this,

1490
01:24:09.131 --> 01:24:12.730
but tax like stock transactions or Tax Wall Street,

1491
01:24:12.910 --> 01:24:15.670
there's like they want to do that.
I think they want to tax the,

1492
01:24:15.760 --> 01:24:16.571
well I don't know what they all want.

1493
01:24:16.571 --> 01:24:19.270
You can't say what they all want cause then they'd all don't want that.

1494
01:24:19.570 --> 01:24:23.170
But there is stuff that keeps bubbling up about their basic demands.

1495
01:24:23.171 --> 01:24:24.870
That does seem to be really question,

1496
01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:27.300
<v 3>what does this kind of accomplished?
That's the real question.</v>

1497
01:24:27.301 --> 01:24:31.440
That's why it's so exciting to me cause this is a period of uncertainty.

1498
01:24:31.710 --> 01:24:34.650
You know,
there's,
it's really obvious that people were pissed off.

1499
01:24:34.651 --> 01:24:37.800
It's really obvious that the cat is out of the bag.

1500
01:24:37.830 --> 01:24:41.160
Everyone knows this is a corrupt system.
It's horribly,
horribly corrupt.

1501
01:24:41.370 --> 01:24:44.190
The congress is corrupt.
Congress is bought and paid for.

1502
01:24:44.191 --> 01:24:45.750
The president is bought and paid for.

1503
01:24:45.990 --> 01:24:49.110
Everyone's bought and paid for it and no one's doing anything to stop any of

1504
01:24:49.111 --> 01:24:53.040
this fucking hoarding that's going on.
No one's doing.
The fact that Obama,

1505
01:24:53.041 --> 01:24:56.070
when he gave the bailouts was trying to limit people,

1506
01:24:56.330 --> 01:25:00.660
limit the rewards to $500,000.
You remember that?
Yup.
As if,
well,

1507
01:25:00.661 --> 01:25:04.590
they need more than everyone else.
Right?
We live with them to 500 that like what?

1508
01:25:04.591 --> 01:25:08.160
No.
And she'd be,
they get nothing.
They get none of them get anything.

1509
01:25:08.161 --> 01:25:12.060
If your fucking company needs to get bailed out,
you don't get to get rewards.

1510
01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:16.830
You don't get huge giant fucking corporate payouts because it's in your
contract.

1511
01:25:16.831 --> 01:25:19.890
You know,
your contract doesn't exist.
There's no fucking business anymore.

1512
01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:23.470
It's all done.
You can't,
you store all the fucking money.
You guys rob,

1513
01:25:23.471 --> 01:25:26.050
do you don't,
you don't get a big bonus for that fuck head.

1514
01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:29.160
<v 4>Do you,
do you,
do you think this is part of the,
uh,</v>

1515
01:25:29.790 --> 01:25:33.210
global awakening that everyone has been predicting forever,

1516
01:25:33.211 --> 01:25:35.380
this kind of transitional shift and conscious?

1517
01:25:35.690 --> 01:25:37.280
<v 3>Yes,
I think so.
I think,
you know,</v>

1518
01:25:37.281 --> 01:25:42.281
there's obviously right now the financial system is insanely complicated.

1519
01:25:43.010 --> 01:25:44.210
You know,
I've tried many,

1520
01:25:44.211 --> 01:25:48.800
many times to sit down and truly wrap my head around stocks and bonds and

1521
01:25:48.801 --> 01:25:52.910
dividends and shorting.
I've,
I've,
I've given it a real good,

1522
01:25:53.150 --> 01:25:58.150
like solid auditing of how the whole process works and it's fucking insanely

1523
01:26:00.171 --> 01:26:04.850
complicated.
It's,
there's so many players,
so many pieces,
so many things.

1524
01:26:05.060 --> 01:26:10.060
And just the idea behind confidence raising and lowering the value of something

1525
01:26:10.251 --> 01:26:12.500
and stocked,
climbing and falling,

1526
01:26:12.501 --> 01:26:16.760
the whole thing being alive and mobile and constantly fluctuating.
It's like,

1527
01:26:16.761 --> 01:26:21.500
what the fuck is this?
Right?
What the fuck do you got going on here?

1528
01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:24.520
What kind of,
this is what we're running our system on.

1529
01:26:24.650 --> 01:26:29.300
We're wanting the money of our system on this crazy,
unpredictable,

1530
01:26:29.301 --> 01:26:33.490
sporadic fucking pulsating changing thing.
Yeah.

1531
01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:37.250
Numbers,
ups and downs and so by,
this is the fun.

1532
01:26:37.300 --> 01:26:41.330
This chaos is the foundation of our society.
I'm like,
wow,

1533
01:26:41.331 --> 01:26:43.820
that's Kinda nutty that that shouldn't be that way,

1534
01:26:43.821 --> 01:26:45.980
that the society should be much more stable.

1535
01:26:46.070 --> 01:26:49.490
I understand that people have gotten insanely wealthy through the situation and

1536
01:26:49.491 --> 01:26:50.860
they don't want to change it because they,

1537
01:26:50.990 --> 01:26:55.040
they get good at it and they know how to continue to be insanely wealthy through

1538
01:26:55.041 --> 01:26:59.900
this situation,
but that ain't right,
man.
It's supposed to be based on something.

1539
01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:04.280
It's supposed to be one piece of gold equals one donkey.
That's the,

1540
01:27:04.550 --> 01:27:06.590
that's the easy way for us to do it.
Yeah.

1541
01:27:06.630 --> 01:27:09.020
You start getting into the stock markets and dividends.

1542
01:27:09.110 --> 01:27:11.390
I understand that there's,
there's a need for credit.

1543
01:27:11.430 --> 01:27:13.870
I understand there's a need for a lot of things.
I understand there's a lot of,

1544
01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:16.250
there's a lot of shit that's going on where it's going to be weird where people

1545
01:27:16.251 --> 01:27:19.130
are holding money and saving money and put money here and Zeros there.

1546
01:27:19.131 --> 01:27:23.270
But it's gotta be a way more simple system than the system we have now because

1547
01:27:23.271 --> 01:27:26.750
there's too much room to fuck with it.
There's too much room for shenanigans,

1548
01:27:27.020 --> 01:27:30.860
you know,
the,
and it doesn't have to be the system we operate under.

1549
01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:34.010
The system we operate under should be simple and stringent and should it be

1550
01:27:34.011 --> 01:27:37.430
really easy to follow and that's way easier said than done.

1551
01:27:37.910 --> 01:27:39.380
But that's what we really need to do.

1552
01:27:39.470 --> 01:27:43.940
<v 4>Well yeah,
it's,
it's definitely,
that's a big part of it.</v>

1553
01:27:43.941 --> 01:27:47.060
But there's like a thing underneath that too,
which is that the,

1554
01:27:47.240 --> 01:27:50.360
the people have got to start learning that.

1555
01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:54.430
Buying constantly thinking that you need to have new shit.

1556
01:27:54.510 --> 01:27:57.810
<v 3>Yeah,
that's bad.
But you know what's worse interest.
You know what's worst?</v>

1557
01:27:57.900 --> 01:28:01.000
This idea that a credit card company can charge you 30 fucking percent on your

1558
01:28:01.001 --> 01:28:05.700
money.
The,
this idea that,
you know,
interest for the longest time was illegal.

1559
01:28:05.940 --> 01:28:09.540
It was against the law.
You,
you couldn't ask for interest,

1560
01:28:09.750 --> 01:28:13.140
<v 4>but people,
what I'm saying is for hundreds of years those credit card companies,</v>

1561
01:28:13.141 --> 01:28:16.740
and again this is like,
I know right now this is a long way away,

1562
01:28:16.750 --> 01:28:19.380
maybe will never happen,
but that couldn't function.

1563
01:28:19.500 --> 01:28:24.500
Credit card companies couldn't function if people had learned till like gain

1564
01:28:26.281 --> 01:28:29.760
pleasure from things that weren't just meant the Wa wasn't based on matters.

1565
01:28:29.870 --> 01:28:32.840
<v 3>Well that's sort of silly because when,
when were they,</v>

1566
01:28:33.080 --> 01:28:34.520
are they allowed to buy things?
Sure.

1567
01:28:34.550 --> 01:28:36.770
What if they don't want to have a fucking stack of money on that?

1568
01:28:36.900 --> 01:28:39.900
<v 4>No credit cards.
I'm sure you know you can.
No,
you can totally like,</v>

1569
01:28:39.930 --> 01:28:40.890
like what Brian said,

1570
01:28:40.891 --> 01:28:43.470
he grew up poor and he wants to get an Xbox and all that stuff,

1571
01:28:43.471 --> 01:28:47.460
but I think that it's people's is people start getting smarter and start

1572
01:28:47.461 --> 01:28:48.210
evolving.

1573
01:28:48.210 --> 01:28:53.040
What hopefully will happen is people will be able to distinguish that.

1574
01:28:53.041 --> 01:28:58.041
I will overcome this idea that they're going to be happier if they have a really

1575
01:28:59.251 --> 01:29:02.010
nice car.
You are correct.
I think you're

1576
01:29:02.010 --> 01:29:06.000
<v 0>naive in your portrayal of what credit cards get used for.
I think most people,</v>

1577
01:29:06.001 --> 01:29:07.320
especially people with families,

1578
01:29:07.321 --> 01:29:09.180
they use their fucking credit cards to eat right,

1579
01:29:09.181 --> 01:29:10.830
and these are credit cards to put gas in their car.

1580
01:29:10.831 --> 01:29:13.500
These are credit cards to pay for things that don't have a big pile of money.

1581
01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:17.190
It's not simply a matter of the entire country is filled with materialists that

1582
01:29:17.191 --> 01:29:20.640
have overstepped their boundaries.
No,
there's people out there struggling,
dude,

1583
01:29:20.820 --> 01:29:22.350
and that's what they use their credit card for it.

1584
01:29:22.351 --> 01:29:24.750
It's not saying if you didn't have a credit card,

1585
01:29:24.751 --> 01:29:26.460
you know you'd be better off because you wouldn't

1586
01:29:26.510 --> 01:29:30.950
<v 4>be a materialist.
No,
no,
no.
I know exactly what I'm saying.
I know it seems naive,</v>

1587
01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:35.450
but it is.
I'm,
I'm saying like the,
you're addressing the x,

1588
01:29:35.480 --> 01:29:40.480
you're addressing the external manifestation of an internal problem that's

1589
01:29:41.420 --> 01:29:43.730
existing in our culture as a,

1590
01:29:43.731 --> 01:29:48.150
as an idea of what it means to be happy.
That's what I think.
I think that,

1591
01:29:48.320 --> 01:29:52.010
and I know people need credit cards now to pay for their family and all that

1592
01:29:52.011 --> 01:29:54.350
stuff,
but hey for other credit card pay for other credit cards.

1593
01:29:54.351 --> 01:29:56.910
But I know a lot of people are the,

1594
01:29:56.980 --> 01:30:01.520
their lives have gotten to the point where they get an a in this fucking car

1595
01:30:01.521 --> 01:30:05.870
that they use credit to buy,
to drive to a job,
to,

1596
01:30:06.200 --> 01:30:07.610
to drive two hours,

1597
01:30:07.611 --> 01:30:11.510
a two hour commute to get to a job where they have to work all fucking day long

1598
01:30:11.690 --> 01:30:15.560
and then they come back in a two hour commute completely exhausted and they

1599
01:30:15.561 --> 01:30:19.130
think this is the way we're supposed to be living.
That's no way to live.

1600
01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:22.100
That's a terrible way.
Right?
You're right.
So,
but what's the alternative?

1601
01:30:22.160 --> 01:30:22.700
Well that's,

1602
01:30:22.700 --> 01:30:25.970
that's I think the idea is to begin to open yourself up to the alternative.

1603
01:30:25.971 --> 01:30:28.820
You are clearly,
it's something to do with staying more local.

1604
01:30:29.060 --> 01:30:32.720
Make it like having communities of people that I'm not saying let's go back to

1605
01:30:32.721 --> 01:30:34.040
villages.
Joe.
What I'm saying.

1606
01:30:34.041 --> 01:30:37.670
There is something to be said for communities of people that are living close

1607
01:30:37.671 --> 01:30:40.490
together and doing more than just waving at each other when they walked down

1608
01:30:40.491 --> 01:30:40.670
this way

1609
01:30:40.670 --> 01:30:41.231
<v 0>street.
That's,</v>

1610
01:30:41.231 --> 01:30:45.130
but that's a broad solution for a singular problem that a person has if they are

1611
01:30:45.131 --> 01:30:46.480
stuck in that sort of a situation.

1612
01:30:46.481 --> 01:30:50.680
Like what is the solution for a guy who does have credit and does have a fucking

1613
01:30:50.681 --> 01:30:54.880
car and does have a mortgage and has a family and is driving fucking an hour and

1614
01:30:54.880 --> 01:30:57.490
a half every day to go to work.
What does a solution for that guy?

1615
01:30:57.580 --> 01:30:59.050
Because it's not a village.

1616
01:30:59.650 --> 01:31:00.910
<v 4>Well,
no,
no the,</v>

1617
01:31:00.911 --> 01:31:05.860
I mean the solution for that guys to like start working its way out of those

1618
01:31:05.861 --> 01:31:07.210
fucking handcuffs.

1619
01:31:07.290 --> 01:31:10.160
<v 0>Right.
But that's the real problem.
The most people find themselves in the,</v>

1620
01:31:10.170 --> 01:31:13.320
most people find themselves in the situation where they make barely enough money

1621
01:31:13.321 --> 01:31:16.520
to get by and not nearly enough money to break free.
Well,

1622
01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:18.460
to step away and to be able to,
I mean it's a tear,

1623
01:31:18.461 --> 01:31:19.620
especially if you have children.

1624
01:31:19.670 --> 01:31:21.830
<v 4>Well that's the,
that's that.
See you know,</v>

1625
01:31:21.831 --> 01:31:24.620
a lot of people when they came to the United States,

1626
01:31:24.621 --> 01:31:26.520
there were intentional communities that happen.

1627
01:31:26.521 --> 01:31:30.410
I had this great book on Utopias where people were coming here like the people

1628
01:31:30.411 --> 01:31:34.810
came here,
like the pilgrims,
they wanted to start religious utopias.

1629
01:31:34.820 --> 01:31:38.360
That's what they were trying to do is like restructure society in a way that

1630
01:31:38.361 --> 01:31:40.670
they could live in a,
in a,
in a,
um,

1631
01:31:40.970 --> 01:31:44.060
in paradise and it kind of like Christian based paradise.

1632
01:31:44.061 --> 01:31:48.110
It didn't clearly didn't work.
It turned into it turned into this.
Right.
But the,

1633
01:31:48.440 --> 01:31:51.140
so what you'll hear,
it's the same thing you hear about communism.

1634
01:31:51.141 --> 01:31:54.320
When you hear about like people saying they want to create like an alternate as

1635
01:31:54.321 --> 01:31:57.140
another society or experiment with a new way to live.
People are like,

1636
01:31:57.290 --> 01:32:00.070
it doesn't work.
You can't do it.
Making these

1637
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:03.310
<v 1>alternative communities doesn't work.
There's no way.
They always fall apart.</v>

1638
01:32:03.311 --> 01:32:06.100
They always collapse.
They end up like Waco or whatever.

1639
01:32:06.370 --> 01:32:10.570
But I think there is a way to do it.
I don't know.
Yeah,

1640
01:32:10.600 --> 01:32:13.900
I haven't gotten high enough yet.
I haven't eaten enough mushrooms.
Yeah.

1641
01:32:14.110 --> 01:32:17.710
But I do think that there is a way to do it.
I don't know what it is.

1642
01:32:18.100 --> 01:32:19.840
<v 3>It has to be a small number of people.</v>

1643
01:32:20.200 --> 01:32:22.480
I think when you get over a certain amount of people,

1644
01:32:22.481 --> 01:32:26.400
there's a thing called diffusion of responsibility and it's like if you're

1645
01:32:26.410 --> 01:32:30.190
around,
if there's 300 people there,
you're more likely to get raped.

1646
01:32:30.191 --> 01:32:33.700
And if there's three,
because there's 300 people there,

1647
01:32:33.760 --> 01:32:36.730
all those people think someone's going to help someone's gonna step in,

1648
01:32:36.790 --> 01:32:39.430
someone's going to step in and help,
but no one does.

1649
01:32:39.460 --> 01:32:42.160
And they don't feel responsible because there's so many other people there.
Well,

1650
01:32:42.161 --> 01:32:44.470
no one did.
I didn't step in,
but no one did.

1651
01:32:44.690 --> 01:32:48.570
If it's just you and that one person getting raped,
you feel obligated.
Right?

1652
01:32:48.690 --> 01:32:51.350
Do you have responsibility?
You're a human being.
You're right there.
And when you,

1653
01:32:51.360 --> 01:32:54.580
we get past the diffusion of responsibility number with human beings,

1654
01:32:54.850 --> 01:32:59.850
which is exactly why we all should have a real philosophical problem with drones

1655
01:33:01.710 --> 01:33:05.860
and wars overseas with people that we don't understand and we don't know.

1656
01:33:05.900 --> 01:33:07.330
We don't know why we're doing this.

1657
01:33:08.110 --> 01:33:12.730
It's easy when it's so many people and it's so far away,
it's way over there.

1658
01:33:12.970 --> 01:33:16.870
But if it's right here at home,
then it,
then it hits you fucking hard.

1659
01:33:16.871 --> 01:33:18.190
Then you feel that responsibility,

1660
01:33:18.190 --> 01:33:20.430
<v 1>the weather underground bring the war back home.</v>

1661
01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:25.640
<v 3>Human beings I think are still designed in a system or our minds function in a</v>

1662
01:33:27.961 --> 01:33:32.961
system that works with a small group of people where we know everybody when we

1663
01:33:33.241 --> 01:33:34.320
branch out of that,

1664
01:33:34.350 --> 01:33:38.640
we are not designed to deal with the elect the internet,

1665
01:33:38.641 --> 01:33:41.340
like communicating with people in complete anonymity.

1666
01:33:41.430 --> 01:33:44.700
Why do you think people are such fucking complete rabbit cons online?
Well,

1667
01:33:44.701 --> 01:33:48.000
because they're frustrated in their everyday life and when they get online they

1668
01:33:48.001 --> 01:33:50.910
have this anonymity and they could just lash out at people and fuck with people

1669
01:33:50.911 --> 01:33:54.260
and score points and they actually enjoy it.
They get off on it.
Yeah.

1670
01:33:54.500 --> 01:33:57.980
<v 1>Do you think we could ever get to a point where we could be like every state is</v>

1671
01:33:57.981 --> 01:34:01.160
their own country?
Like how it should be,
you know,
like how it is.

1672
01:34:01.330 --> 01:34:05.660
It's kind of like you had to state law but have less,
uh,
of a,

1673
01:34:05.661 --> 01:34:08.060
a nation government.
They're there to protect,

1674
01:34:08.070 --> 01:34:12.710
but we fuck with too many other countries,
man.
National fraternities.
That's it.

1675
01:34:12.711 --> 01:34:13.421
Yeah.
But the,

1676
01:34:13.421 --> 01:34:16.550
they won't do that because then they start fucking putting you in situations.

1677
01:34:16.700 --> 01:34:17.360
Look,

1678
01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:22.130
Eisenhower warned about the military industrial complex and it sounds like some,

1679
01:34:22.310 --> 01:34:25.790
you know,
Alex Jones sounds like some nutty shit when,
you know,

1680
01:34:25.791 --> 01:34:29.300
you start talking about the idea that people are trying to go to war for money,

1681
01:34:29.301 --> 01:34:30.500
but they fucking arm man.

1682
01:34:30.501 --> 01:34:34.910
And the only way to keep people a and war is you have to,

1683
01:34:35.060 --> 01:34:37.790
you have to force people,
you have to fucking make them go a tad people,

1684
01:34:37.791 --> 01:34:40.730
you have to,
you have to ship them over to different places.
Yeah.

1685
01:34:40.940 --> 01:34:43.130
<v 3>You know,
you have a bunch of states.</v>

1686
01:34:43.131 --> 01:34:47.540
If every state really was like its own country and the United States didn't act

1687
01:34:47.541 --> 01:34:48.141
as a whole,

1688
01:34:48.141 --> 01:34:50.600
it wasn't out there fucking around with all these different parts of the world.

1689
01:34:50.810 --> 01:34:53.990
We wouldn't have,
you know,
it would be completely different setup.

1690
01:34:55.020 --> 01:34:58.040
<v 1>Well it seems like that would make a lot more sense because it seems like it's</v>

1691
01:34:58.040 --> 01:35:00.230
<v 4>too fucked up on a large scale.</v>

1692
01:35:00.231 --> 01:35:04.520
That breaking it down into 50 pieces would be the only way that really save,

1693
01:35:05.080 --> 01:35:06.650
you know,
get any kind of order from it.

1694
01:35:07.340 --> 01:35:11.660
<v 3>The only way to get any order out of it is it's got a breakdown and then be</v>

1695
01:35:11.661 --> 01:35:12.740
rebuilt properly.

1696
01:35:13.180 --> 01:35:16.770
<v 4>That is a,
that idea is a,
is an idea that I,</v>

1697
01:35:16.830 --> 01:35:21.610
some I teeter on.
I,
I'm cause I,
well I don't want it to,
I don't want it to break.

1698
01:35:21.611 --> 01:35:22.421
I don't want it to break down.

1699
01:35:22.421 --> 01:35:25.420
I don't want the fucking thing to collapse and I don't want to,
I don't,
I like,

1700
01:35:25.570 --> 01:35:26.403
I like,

1701
01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:29.770
I like my life and I like it here and I don't want the power to shut off and I

1702
01:35:29.771 --> 01:35:32.480
don't want to,
I don't want,
so I,
so,
but I,
I,

1703
01:35:32.610 --> 01:35:34.420
I consider it and I keep thinking like,

1704
01:35:34.421 --> 01:35:39.421
well probably it's going to require some kind of blip at that level for

1705
01:35:40.750 --> 01:35:45.280
everything to get better.
But I,
I love,
you know,
wedding,
my mind gets it.
Or like,

1706
01:35:45.281 --> 01:35:46.900
okay,
but what if there's another option?

1707
01:35:47.350 --> 01:35:51.250
<v 3>What if those are options technology?
The other option is there's going to be,</v>

1708
01:35:51.310 --> 01:35:55.330
this is what I believe.
If I had to guess what I think is going to happen,

1709
01:35:55.331 --> 01:36:00.331
barring natural disasters or any extreme world conflict that becomes nuclear,

1710
01:36:01.210 --> 01:36:03.610
what's going to happen is we're going to have some sort of,

1711
01:36:03.611 --> 01:36:06.220
have a connection through,

1712
01:36:06.280 --> 01:36:11.280
through online communication that literally allows people to look inside each

1713
01:36:12.311 --> 01:36:15.700
other's heads.
Yeah.
That's what I think to amp up that.
Do you think the same way?

1714
01:36:15.720 --> 01:36:16.030
Oh

1715
01:36:16.030 --> 01:36:19.180
<v 4>fuck yeah,
man,
I've thought that.
I've thought it's the ultimate.
It's,
yeah.</v>

1716
01:36:19.181 --> 01:36:21.310
What it is is it allows you to experience another yeah.

1717
01:36:21.330 --> 01:36:23.480
<v 3>Person's conscience.
Yes,
exactly.
Exactly.</v>

1718
01:36:23.481 --> 01:36:27.290
Do it allows you to even be inside another person's mind,
you know,

1719
01:36:27.291 --> 01:36:31.370
and then we all can link up as one mind and that's not the,
you know,

1720
01:36:31.400 --> 01:36:34.520
that's not nearly as difficult as it sounds when you think about what we've

1721
01:36:34.521 --> 01:36:38.870
already been able to,
to the fact that we can send video through the fucking sky.

1722
01:36:39.230 --> 01:36:40.670
You know,
when I was in Australia,

1723
01:36:40.671 --> 01:36:44.210
my wife was sending me pictures of the baby and she sends me pictures of the

1724
01:36:44.211 --> 01:36:48.950
baby and I get them in a second blip,
right?
Images,

1725
01:36:48.951 --> 01:36:53.840
photos,
video.
It's fucking craziness,
man.
The idea behind it is insane.

1726
01:36:53.990 --> 01:36:58.010
You can send a fucking picture and somehow or another it goes through these.

1727
01:36:58.080 --> 01:36:58.761
Where does it go?

1728
01:36:58.761 --> 01:37:02.630
It goes through the air and that eventually hit some fucking metal box.

1729
01:37:02.631 --> 01:37:07.190
It's got electricity and it sends it to the other side of the fucking planet in

1730
01:37:07.191 --> 01:37:10.730
a second.
All right.
Through the ocean and over the sky.

1731
01:37:10.760 --> 01:37:14.120
How the fuck is it even getting there?
Who knows?
I have no idea,

1732
01:37:14.121 --> 01:37:18.020
but I know it was their bank and that to me is way crazier,

1733
01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:22.280
way crazier than the ability to experience someone else's consciousness.

1734
01:37:22.370 --> 01:37:25.160
You explain the experience,
your consciousness,
right?
You are.

1735
01:37:25.161 --> 01:37:27.920
You tuned into your own contracts.
You're there,
you're inside your head.

1736
01:37:28.370 --> 01:37:30.880
How do we know it's not just a simple frequency?

1737
01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:35.750
I can just tune into it and when your mind and my mind lock up together and

1738
01:37:35.751 --> 01:37:36.850
become one consciousness,

1739
01:37:37.090 --> 01:37:40.690
<v 4>that's a funny moment to that mode because what would happen is that as this</v>

1740
01:37:40.691 --> 01:37:43.150
technology began to spread,
it wouldn't,
you know,

1741
01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:46.510
start off in a laboratory where one scientist would merge minds with another

1742
01:37:46.511 --> 01:37:48.670
scientist and now it changed our lives forever.

1743
01:37:48.671 --> 01:37:51.790
Just merging minds with one person in a real way.

1744
01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:55.950
It's going to forever change you because you'll know how similar you are to

1745
01:37:55.951 --> 01:37:58.440
someone out.
You'll know if maybe you're completely different.

1746
01:37:58.680 --> 01:38:03.300
Maybe this person is actually happy and your whole life you've been lying about

1747
01:38:03.301 --> 01:38:07.910
app being happy to yourself and suddenly feels someone who's really happy and

1748
01:38:07.920 --> 01:38:10.680
you're like,
oh shit.
That's what it feels like.

1749
01:38:10.950 --> 01:38:12.780
That's what real happiness feels like.

1750
01:38:12.781 --> 01:38:14.670
And then you know how to become happy yourself.

1751
01:38:14.790 --> 01:38:18.630
So what would happen is it would spread from the laboratory.
It would spread out,

1752
01:38:18.780 --> 01:38:22.650
but eventually people would rise up against it.
They'd be like,

1753
01:38:22.651 --> 01:38:26.430
don't plug into the mind.
If you plug into the mind,

1754
01:38:26.460 --> 01:38:29.400
you won't want to come back.
You won't be able to come back to your life.

1755
01:38:29.550 --> 01:38:32.040
People would fight it.
It would be a form of suicide.

1756
01:38:32.190 --> 01:38:37.190
Because after you've experienced consciousness at the scale of the merged minds

1757
01:38:37.441 --> 01:38:39.660
of like 15 million people,

1758
01:38:39.930 --> 01:38:41.850
how are you going to come back to your one little mind?

1759
01:38:42.600 --> 01:38:46.590
It would just turn into these pods of people just get out of my head,
you freaks.

1760
01:38:46.740 --> 01:38:51.300
I gotta go beat off.
Uh,
now it's going to beat off into the hive mind.
Fuck yeah,

1761
01:38:51.301 --> 01:38:54.930
the sex,
there'd be huge or gs online.
It would be these,

1762
01:38:55.170 --> 01:38:59.760
it would be probably be like just some massive orgasm because like also think of

1763
01:38:59.761 --> 01:39:03.360
the learning,
so okay,
I don't know how to do like Jujitsu,

1764
01:39:03.690 --> 01:39:07.770
but I merged consciousness with someone who's an expert at it and suddenly I'm

1765
01:39:07.771 --> 01:39:11.370
like,
learn everything that they know about it.
You would,

1766
01:39:11.371 --> 01:39:14.730
everyone would instantaneously gained the information of everyone else.

1767
01:39:15.120 --> 01:39:20.010
Everyone become experts simultaneously and that would create like a surge

1768
01:39:20.011 --> 01:39:20.970
forward and evolution.

1769
01:39:20.971 --> 01:39:24.540
I think that's that fucking singularity McKenna is talking about is it's

1770
01:39:24.690 --> 01:39:27.900
everybody's like the computers are going to crush us.
It's like,
no,

1771
01:39:27.901 --> 01:39:28.681
that's not what it is.

1772
01:39:28.681 --> 01:39:31.860
We're just going to merge with them or we're going to become part of a,

1773
01:39:32.130 --> 01:39:34.980
of a electronic web of consciousness.

1774
01:39:35.220 --> 01:39:38.070
And the moment everyone becomes an expert,

1775
01:39:38.970 --> 01:39:42.210
that's the moment that you know with our minds together.

1776
01:39:42.211 --> 01:39:43.770
That's when you create the time.
As you know,

1777
01:39:43.771 --> 01:39:47.550
that's when he create teleportation or that's when you create some new form of

1778
01:39:47.551 --> 01:39:51.630
life.
Seems like it's inevitable,
inevitable and it is inevitable.
It's an,

1779
01:39:51.990 --> 01:39:56.490
you said this to me once Brian,
about uh,
about um,
the human brain.

1780
01:39:56.491 --> 01:39:58.560
You said it's input output.
It's like,
Oh,

1781
01:39:58.561 --> 01:40:02.730
you have to do is figure out what the fucking output is of this electricity up

1782
01:40:02.731 --> 01:40:05.250
in the,
in your brain.
Understand how that works.

1783
01:40:05.430 --> 01:40:09.240
Figure out a way to input that into a machine where it can decode it and then

1784
01:40:09.241 --> 01:40:10.500
you've got it.
Then you've like,

1785
01:40:10.530 --> 01:40:13.890
then you have electronic telepathy and they were already verging on.

1786
01:40:13.950 --> 01:40:17.610
They're already sort of learning how to identify certain like patterns in the

1787
01:40:17.611 --> 01:40:19.620
brain.
You know how like they can show someone,

1788
01:40:19.830 --> 01:40:23.940
they can do a brain scan on someone and show them a picture of a room and tell

1789
01:40:23.941 --> 01:40:25.950
if they've been in that room or not.
Do you know about that?

1790
01:40:26.280 --> 01:40:30.540
So it's like that's pretty crazy.
It's fucked up man.
It's fucked up.

1791
01:40:30.541 --> 01:40:33.970
If you want to try to get away with something because credible go,

1792
01:40:34.450 --> 01:40:37.950
you've been in here before.
He's like,
no,
I'm never seen it before.
No,

1793
01:40:37.951 --> 01:40:42.030
you definitely have like we can tell it's just the next step is,
okay,

1794
01:40:42.150 --> 01:40:45.380
well can we extract images from a person's mind?
Can we start with,

1795
01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:50.530
we've talked about this before,
the video,
they've already done this.
So then,

1796
01:40:50.590 --> 01:40:53.140
then that's the,
that's it man.
Then it's really crude right now,

1797
01:40:53.141 --> 01:40:53.980
but you know I'm still

1798
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:54.611
<v 0>looks pretty good.</v>

1799
01:40:54.611 --> 01:40:59.410
It looks kind of like if you were to blow up an old cell phone video from 1991

1800
01:40:59.620 --> 01:41:01.180
or something like that and blow it up big.

1801
01:41:01.280 --> 01:41:02.780
<v 4>So yeah,
that's an a,
it's inevitable.</v>

1802
01:41:02.810 --> 01:41:05.810
So then the next step of course is going to be like,
you know,

1803
01:41:05.811 --> 01:41:09.170
perfecting that technology.
Then the next step is going to be like,
okay,

1804
01:41:09.290 --> 01:41:12.320
so I know that when someone's feeling happiness,

1805
01:41:12.620 --> 01:41:15.320
then this is the part of his brain that gets activated,

1806
01:41:15.500 --> 01:41:19.490
so now all I've got to do is like record that activated part of his brain,

1807
01:41:19.730 --> 01:41:22.800
play that video back inside someone's brain,

1808
01:41:22.830 --> 01:41:26.510
figure out a way to stimulate someone else's brain with that same activity and

1809
01:41:26.511 --> 01:41:30.920
boom,
instead of fucking you'll have,
there'll be emotional records.

1810
01:41:31.160 --> 01:41:33.810
You know what I mean?
Instead of like record players,

1811
01:41:33.811 --> 01:41:35.670
there'll be like these emotional devices where he,

1812
01:41:35.730 --> 01:41:38.570
where it'll be like the feelings of a summer day.

1813
01:41:38.830 --> 01:41:41.680
<v 0>I don't even know if we're going to get that indulgent man.
If we all link up.</v>

1814
01:41:41.681 --> 01:41:44.590
I think the linkup was probably going to be before the recording.

1815
01:41:45.040 --> 01:41:47.980
I think the linkup is probably going to come first.
I'm hoping.

1816
01:41:48.010 --> 01:41:51.310
I'm hoping it doesn't just become a self indulgent wine fest.

1817
01:41:51.440 --> 01:41:53.170
We'll get together and,
I don't know,

1818
01:41:53.171 --> 01:41:58.030
there'll be recording rank and watch people experience breakups of terrible

1819
01:41:58.040 --> 01:42:01.660
breakouts.
It's all memories of breakups that go through it on purpose.
Oh,
I got,

1820
01:42:01.661 --> 01:42:05.050
I went through the worst breakup last night.
How a husband came home.

1821
01:42:05.080 --> 01:42:08.380
It's not your husband,
it's just fucking thing.
Okay.
But in the,
in the program,

1822
01:42:08.590 --> 01:42:10.740
my husband came home,
we had four children together,

1823
01:42:10.750 --> 01:42:14.620
we were struggling and he was running off to Mexico with a secretary and I was

1824
01:42:14.621 --> 01:42:17.920
devastated.
And he said,
let the kids starve.
I don't give a fuck.
And he left me.

1825
01:42:17.950 --> 01:42:21.760
It was,
it was horrible.
And he hit me and he fucked me.
And then he left.
Man.

1826
01:42:22.060 --> 01:42:24.070
People write reviews of them people.

1827
01:42:24.100 --> 01:42:27.340
If that was what your real memory and people would cry and then we'd go,

1828
01:42:27.341 --> 01:42:28.420
oh my God,
you want a good cry,

1829
01:42:28.450 --> 01:42:31.870
you have to try this and you'll get really happy like award shows for best

1830
01:42:31.871 --> 01:42:33.340
breakups and yeah.
You know,
best

1831
01:42:34.150 --> 01:42:36.540
<v 4>via about this.
Where like they of course there was like,</v>

1832
01:42:37.180 --> 01:42:40.900
there was this underground yeah.
Tapes of it and shit.
Well,
yeah,

1833
01:42:40.901 --> 01:42:43.420
I think that like,
I think it's going to,
uh,

1834
01:42:43.540 --> 01:42:45.700
it's definitely going to get to that place.
I can't wait.

1835
01:42:45.820 --> 01:42:48.340
<v 0>Well,
the idea of you can see something,
okay.</v>

1836
01:42:48.341 --> 01:42:50.980
If you look at something and then that registers as an image and you can see

1837
01:42:50.981 --> 01:42:54.700
that image on a computer.
What about your imagination?
What about,

1838
01:42:54.730 --> 01:42:59.410
is it possible to see,
I mean,
you're not seeing anything,
but what?

1839
01:42:59.411 --> 01:43:02.140
Where is,
where is it?
What's being registered?

1840
01:43:02.141 --> 01:43:05.950
When you were having a visual experience in a dream,
what exactly,

1841
01:43:05.951 --> 01:43:09.670
where's that registering?
Right.
It's registering in your imagination,
I guess.

1842
01:43:09.820 --> 01:43:14.110
Is there a frequency that can be tuned into just like it is with that image when

1843
01:43:14.111 --> 01:43:17.550
you see it from the eyes,
is there a frequency that can be tuned into it?
Yeah,

1844
01:43:17.560 --> 01:43:19.050
it must be.
Must Be,
right?

1845
01:43:19.140 --> 01:43:19.831
<v 4>It's gotta be,
it's,</v>

1846
01:43:19.831 --> 01:43:22.110
I mean it's definitely something's happening and there's some,

1847
01:43:22.530 --> 01:43:27.210
some biochemical reaction that's happening that's producing the effect of you

1848
01:43:27.211 --> 01:43:29.370
watching fucking werewolf 69

1849
01:43:29.720 --> 01:43:32.810
<v 0>they sound all boiled down to we're going to,</v>

1850
01:43:32.870 --> 01:43:36.800
we're just going to slowly break down the matter of reality itself.

1851
01:43:37.040 --> 01:43:38.780
That's what we're at right now.
You know,

1852
01:43:38.781 --> 01:43:42.140
Makenna described what's going to happen with the exponential increase in the,

1853
01:43:42.420 --> 01:43:42.620
in,

1854
01:43:42.620 --> 01:43:46.850
in technology that it's like a funnel and then if you spin a quarter around the

1855
01:43:46.851 --> 01:43:49.970
lip of the funnel,
it takes a long time to go around in a circle.

1856
01:43:50.180 --> 01:43:52.910
But as it gets lower and lower in the funnel,

1857
01:43:52.911 --> 01:43:55.760
it picks up speed and it goes faster and faster and faster.

1858
01:43:55.960 --> 01:43:57.020
And that's really what it's like.

1859
01:43:57.021 --> 01:44:00.200
It takes it just a millisecond to make a full revolution now.

1860
01:44:00.201 --> 01:44:04.250
Whereas before it was years.
Yeah.
That's,
and,
and yeah,
it's going to be,

1861
01:44:04.430 --> 01:44:07.730
and we're experiencing the very,
very beginning of that.

1862
01:44:07.731 --> 01:44:12.260
And it's weird how a lot of that is like coming out and like the form of cell

1863
01:44:12.261 --> 01:44:14.390
phones.
Do you think that that's too convenient?

1864
01:44:14.770 --> 01:44:17.810
What the world is going to change and the,
the,

1865
01:44:17.811 --> 01:44:21.860
the reality itself is going to change during the time of your life?

1866
01:44:22.360 --> 01:44:25.700
I'm never,
do you ever stop and think that wow,
maybe this is a work of fiction?

1867
01:44:25.790 --> 01:44:27.380
Well,
no I don't.
I don't think,

1868
01:44:27.381 --> 01:44:32.180
I can't think it's a work of fiction because you w in our,
in this year,

1869
01:44:32.181 --> 01:44:35.060
if you watch technological advances this fucking year,

1870
01:44:35.330 --> 01:44:38.330
this year for the first time,
as far as I know,

1871
01:44:38.490 --> 01:44:41.240
because I know that the phones have had voice recognition technology,

1872
01:44:41.241 --> 01:44:46.241
but this year for the first time in human history we have now we now we have a

1873
01:44:47.031 --> 01:44:49.310
device or you can talk to it like a person.

1874
01:44:49.370 --> 01:44:53.000
I don't think you can understand what I'm saying.
I'm saying life itself,

1875
01:44:53.190 --> 01:44:55.850
a work of fiction.
Oh right.
This is,

1876
01:44:55.851 --> 01:44:59.780
this is too convenient stories theory.
Fuck that.

1877
01:44:59.781 --> 01:45:03.710
So much of it seems so bizarre and so much of it seems so fake.

1878
01:45:03.711 --> 01:45:05.770
And you know,
speaking of Breitbart,

1879
01:45:05.780 --> 01:45:09.440
he's the one who busted Andrew Wiener for showing his cock.
You know?
I mean,

1880
01:45:09.441 --> 01:45:13.490
you know you,
you know what I'm saying?
Like these wars,
this economy,

1881
01:45:13.580 --> 01:45:17.630
occupy Wall Street rising up,
just as you're getting older,
this is,

1882
01:45:17.631 --> 01:45:21.830
your body is slowly starting to slow down and you're checking your heart from

1883
01:45:21.840 --> 01:45:25.910
weird things.
Every now and then and meanwhile everything's picking up overseas.

1884
01:45:26.150 --> 01:45:27.290
Don't,
don't,
don't,
don't,
don't.

1885
01:45:27.291 --> 01:45:30.380
There's more war and then we might go to war with Iran.
Ooh.

1886
01:45:30.500 --> 01:45:35.500
It's almost like as your life becomes more and more complex and reaches the

1887
01:45:36.831 --> 01:45:40.700
inevitable end,
yeah.
Your story is getting more and more complicated.

1888
01:45:40.701 --> 01:45:43.280
Your story is getting more and more involved.
Your story,

1889
01:45:43.281 --> 01:45:46.100
the story of the world that you live in,
this,

1890
01:45:46.280 --> 01:45:50.770
this work of imagination that whoever the fuck is hearing this has created in

1891
01:45:50.771 --> 01:45:53.840
each one of us has created our own little version of it and they're all

1892
01:45:53.841 --> 01:45:58.841
intertwined inexorably and some just crazy meshy matrix of reality and thinking

1893
01:46:00.561 --> 01:46:05.561
and love and peace and anger and bullshit and all intertwined together.

1894
01:46:05.960 --> 01:46:10.460
Just signals,
just ones and Zeros flying around through fucking space.

1895
01:46:10.730 --> 01:46:15.170
And as you get further and further along your version of it just more and more

1896
01:46:15.171 --> 01:46:16.004
fucked.

1897
01:46:16.280 --> 01:46:19.910
The point where you can't drink the water anymore and this guy's fucking brown

1898
01:46:19.911 --> 01:46:24.911
and pollution and earthquakes and war and crackings cracking crackings they

1899
01:46:26.001 --> 01:46:26.300
fell.

1900
01:46:26.300 --> 01:46:30.260
They found evidence of a crack and they believe that at one point the dinosaur

1901
01:46:30.261 --> 01:46:33.990
bonds.
Yeah.
They believe at one point in time there was a giant mother,

1902
01:46:34.020 --> 01:46:37.030
mother fucker of an octopus that was just a good,

1903
01:46:37.050 --> 01:46:41.960
they have fossils of imprints of giant suction cups.

1904
01:46:41.961 --> 01:46:46.310
It's one of the things that led them to believe this and the dinosaur graveyards

1905
01:46:46.311 --> 01:46:48.170
that were clearly arranged,

1906
01:46:48.470 --> 01:46:53.370
the same octopus's arrange or Octopi arrange their kill.

1907
01:46:53.710 --> 01:46:55.610
Right?
Yeah.
And so they think that,
you know,

1908
01:46:55.620 --> 01:46:57.600
the idea that sailor is always afraid of the crack.

1909
01:46:57.601 --> 01:46:59.550
And that might've been a real animal at one point in time,

1910
01:46:59.670 --> 01:47:03.660
but it was a soft tissue animal like an octopus is.
So when it,
it's gone,

1911
01:47:03.661 --> 01:47:05.100
it's gone.
It doesn't leave any evidence.

1912
01:47:06.120 --> 01:47:10.340
<v 4>Um,
yeah.
So you think that that's,
that's novelty.</v>

1913
01:47:10.341 --> 01:47:13.340
That's like McCain is novelty stuff like that popping up is like,

1914
01:47:13.610 --> 01:47:15.390
cause Mckenna talked about how his wife

1915
01:47:16.020 --> 01:47:18.690
<v 0>thinking that this whole thing might be someone's imagination.</v>

1916
01:47:18.900 --> 01:47:21.220
It might be your imagination.
It might be my imagination now.

1917
01:47:21.221 --> 01:47:24.910
It'd be a combination of everyone's imagination.
I mean things are real.
They,

1918
01:47:24.911 --> 01:47:28.230
there's real laws to this life.
Yeah.
Cause are,
but it,
God damn,

1919
01:47:28.231 --> 01:47:29.670
it operates like a work of fiction.

1920
01:47:30.490 --> 01:47:34.540
<v 4>Well,
yeah,
it's a,
yeah.
Yeah,
it does kind of seem like that.
It does seem like,</v>

1921
01:47:35.110 --> 01:47:37.810
you know,
like you'll run into somebody,
like sometimes you'll,

1922
01:47:37.900 --> 01:47:40.260
you'll run into someone that you haven't seen in a long time and you've,

1923
01:47:40.410 --> 01:47:41.980
and you've thought about him and it just stopped.
Oh,

1924
01:47:41.990 --> 01:47:44.790
hides of running into them or,
but,
and you know,
people will quotes too,

1925
01:47:44.830 --> 01:47:47.650
<v 0>two sticks and people would try to talk you out of thinking that way and they'll</v>

1926
01:47:47.651 --> 01:47:50.740
tell you,
well,
I went through my entire life and I'm real and you're not,

1927
01:47:50.741 --> 01:47:52.000
you didn't just think me up.

1928
01:47:52.001 --> 01:47:55.370
And I have a memory of my childhood and I'm really good at football.

1929
01:47:55.371 --> 01:47:57.730
And I learned how to play that over years and years of hard work.

1930
01:47:57.880 --> 01:48:00.760
So I'm not a part of your fucking imagination,
pal.
I'm a real person.

1931
01:48:01.240 --> 01:48:04.400
You might be a part of your own imagination.
Am I you,

1932
01:48:04.401 --> 01:48:07.990
you might be creating your thing with your imagination as I create mine with

1933
01:48:07.991 --> 01:48:10.660
mine.
And they intertwined.
It's not either or.

1934
01:48:10.710 --> 01:48:13.980
<v 4>You know what this reminds me of,
and stop me if I've already said this before,</v>

1935
01:48:14.190 --> 01:48:15.023
but I,

1936
01:48:15.210 --> 01:48:19.530
did I ever talk about the idea of what would happen if the universe suddenly

1937
01:48:19.531 --> 01:48:23.100
gained consciousness out of nothingness?
Did ever talk about this idea I had?

1938
01:48:23.350 --> 01:48:27.450
I ain't tripping.
It's like so like,
cause I was thinking like,
okay,
what happened?

1939
01:48:27.480 --> 01:48:28.830
What would happen if the universe woke up?

1940
01:48:28.831 --> 01:48:30.640
All of a sudden now there's nothing was here.
It was nothing.

1941
01:48:30.641 --> 01:48:35.310
That's pre big bang conditions,
right?
Right.
Universe wakes up.
Pure consciousness,

1942
01:48:35.311 --> 01:48:38.510
pure fucking consciousness,
no differentiation.
Just consciousness.

1943
01:48:38.520 --> 01:48:39.810
Just pure awareness,
right?

1944
01:48:40.350 --> 01:48:45.060
Nobody but infinitely conscious of itself.
Completely aware.

1945
01:48:45.870 --> 01:48:50.870
Now I was thinking like that the initial reaction to that sense of being aware

1946
01:48:50.881 --> 01:48:54.990
that you're nothing that your nothingness,
he,
it's,
it's this weird resonance.

1947
01:48:54.991 --> 01:48:59.991
It would create horror is what it would do is create this anguished terror from

1948
01:49:00.751 --> 01:49:03.570
waking up and realizing you're here,

1949
01:49:03.571 --> 01:49:07.890
you're some primordial thing and then that terror would be,
I don't get it.
Why?

1950
01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:09.820
Well it's like a,
would that be terror?

1951
01:49:09.821 --> 01:49:12.930
Especially if you don't have a body and you have no ego.
Where's the terror?

1952
01:49:13.110 --> 01:49:15.330
The terror comes from this.
This idea came,

1953
01:49:15.390 --> 01:49:19.650
came to me and I was thinking like what would happen if something fucked up and

1954
01:49:19.651 --> 01:49:24.651
my consciousness got trapped and like a table or something like that.

1955
01:49:24.990 --> 01:49:28.620
You know what I mean?
Oh,
is tripping.

1956
01:49:28.621 --> 01:49:31.320
I was on Lsd and I was thinking,
cause I was looking at,
I was,

1957
01:49:31.321 --> 01:49:34.410
this is when I was in science class and I still remember I was tripping in high

1958
01:49:34.411 --> 01:49:35.010
school.

1959
01:49:35.010 --> 01:49:39.030
I had my head in my arms and I was looking at the fucking table and for a second

1960
01:49:39.031 --> 01:49:43.170
it felt like my consciousness had shifted into the table and was kind of like

1961
01:49:43.171 --> 01:49:43.950
trapped there.

1962
01:49:43.950 --> 01:49:46.950
<v 0>It isn't a school thought that everything has a consciousness.
I mean,
yeah,</v>

1963
01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:48.070
I mean I've,

1964
01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:51.130
we've talked about it several times at planets may very well be some sort of a

1965
01:49:51.131 --> 01:49:55.300
super organism that can express itself in movement to us.

1966
01:49:55.301 --> 01:49:58.450
So we don't think of it as a,
as a living thing or was it a conscious thing,

1967
01:49:58.451 --> 01:50:02.670
but the whole planet might have a type of consciousness.
Imagine that scene.

1968
01:50:03.090 --> 01:50:05.190
<v 4>Let's,
let's just put into this weird idea.</v>

1969
01:50:05.191 --> 01:50:09.030
The idea that this infinite consciousness had some ability to experience

1970
01:50:09.450 --> 01:50:13.890
aloneness,
you know,
loneliness,
aloneness.
It was just by itself

1971
01:50:14.150 --> 01:50:16.530
<v 0>Nicholas.
Cause that's a human idea or an animal id.</v>

1972
01:50:16.531 --> 01:50:20.360
And the only reason why you have this feeling of needing to be with someone is

1973
01:50:20.361 --> 01:50:23.030
because that's how you fucking stay alive and not get eaten by Jaguars.

1974
01:50:23.031 --> 01:50:24.250
It's built into fortunately spirit.

1975
01:50:24.290 --> 01:50:28.820
But my point is you're attaching like these human,

1976
01:50:29.630 --> 01:50:33.980
you are the universe.
We are the universe,
humans are the universe,
right?

1977
01:50:33.981 --> 01:50:36.470
But where we are obviously here with a task,

1978
01:50:36.800 --> 01:50:41.600
we are obviously some weird little crazy button push and monkey with a task and

1979
01:50:41.630 --> 01:50:46.220
this,
this need for this task has ingrained into us all of these,

1980
01:50:46.340 --> 01:50:50.620
these really needy characteristics that you can't associate gods with how we're

1981
01:50:50.630 --> 01:50:53.990
we're,
I'm not saying God at all,
I'm saying universal consciousness.

1982
01:50:54.020 --> 01:50:54.853
The universe itself,

1983
01:50:55.420 --> 01:50:58.940
we are one inarguable thing is we're an extrusion of the universe.

1984
01:50:59.030 --> 01:51:02.150
That's what we are.
We're the universe in extruding itself,

1985
01:51:02.151 --> 01:51:05.530
in the form of a thing that is capable of feeling loneliness.

1986
01:51:05.531 --> 01:51:08.570
It is capable of what you're saying is that the universe is everything,

1987
01:51:08.780 --> 01:51:12.770
including people separately.
The whole universe isn't just the planets.

1988
01:51:12.890 --> 01:51:16.370
It's not just the stars.
It's every organism,
every,
so we're a partner.

1989
01:51:16.890 --> 01:51:18.180
We're worthy universe.
Yeah.

1990
01:51:18.270 --> 01:51:22.260
<v 4>Experiencing itself in this specific way.
The universe has</v>

1991
01:51:24.110 --> 01:51:28.800
divided itself.
The university's divided itself into a lot of shit.

1992
01:51:29.100 --> 01:51:33.480
And part of that shit is feeling lonely,
pain,

1993
01:51:33.690 --> 01:51:38.160
suffering,
anchor,
text,
horror,
happiness,

1994
01:51:38.310 --> 01:51:42.330
joy,
all of it.
It is the universe experiencing itself.

1995
01:51:42.360 --> 01:51:45.480
There's no way to to uh,
deny that you,
if you,

1996
01:51:45.481 --> 01:51:47.490
unless you think humans aren't part of the universe,

1997
01:51:47.670 --> 01:51:50.670
unless you think you're some kind of thing that's distanced or outside of

1998
01:51:50.671 --> 01:51:53.870
everything else,
you are part,

1999
01:51:53.880 --> 01:51:58.620
you are infinity sticking its head into this little bubble of whatever this

2000
01:51:58.621 --> 01:52:01.600
place is and feeling.
So I,

2001
01:52:01.680 --> 01:52:06.390
what I thought was maybe what fucking happened was,
uh,
this,

2002
01:52:06.391 --> 01:52:10.680
uh,
this consciousness,
it or what did happen is we do know it exploded.

2003
01:52:11.040 --> 01:52:12.750
We don't know if there was something before the Big Bang,

2004
01:52:12.751 --> 01:52:15.450
but we do know it blew up.
Something exploded.

2005
01:52:15.600 --> 01:52:18.150
So I'm thinking maybe it had some kind of fucking nervous breakdown.

2006
01:52:18.420 --> 01:52:23.420
It's shattered into a bunch of fucking infinite pieces of which we're one part,

2007
01:52:23.730 --> 01:52:24.970
we're part of that we're,

2008
01:52:25.030 --> 01:52:30.030
what we are is one tiny little broken shard of the universe that blew up a long

2009
01:52:30.451 --> 01:52:31.284
time ago.

2010
01:52:31.320 --> 01:52:35.700
And it's like what I considered what I thought would be like this initial state

2011
01:52:35.701 --> 01:52:39.870
of absolute are I think everyone in their own lives in their own ways,

2012
01:52:39.871 --> 01:52:42.870
dealing with it in a very small level,
the fear of death,

2013
01:52:43.140 --> 01:52:46.400
the fear of merging back into the,
the fear,

2014
01:52:46.520 --> 01:52:51.290
all that stuff manifest in your life is these like is his fear and,
and,
and,

2015
01:52:51.291 --> 01:52:52.730
and weakness.

2016
01:52:52.970 --> 01:52:56.630
And it's like we're like tiny little fragments of the universe trying to fix

2017
01:52:56.631 --> 01:53:00.860
itself on a minuscule level.
That's what I was thinking when I was tripping out.

2018
01:53:02.300 --> 01:53:04.340
<v 3>I see good people,
uh,
in a different way.</v>

2019
01:53:04.341 --> 01:53:09.341
And I think the reason why we have a ego and desire and lust and greed and

2020
01:53:11.690 --> 01:53:15.470
selfishness and you know,
any,

2021
01:53:15.471 --> 01:53:17.930
any jealousy and Yg,
all of these issues,

2022
01:53:18.170 --> 01:53:22.150
they're all negatives and positives.
They are all pullers.

2023
01:53:22.151 --> 01:53:25.850
There are tractors to get us to do specific things and most importantly to make

2024
01:53:25.851 --> 01:53:30.590
sure that things stay in motion and that people continue to innovate and they

2025
01:53:30.591 --> 01:53:35.450
continue to want to produce things and continue to want to do things that are

2026
01:53:35.451 --> 01:53:40.430
special so that they get attention or money or reward or could pile up objects.

2027
01:53:40.670 --> 01:53:41.780
And I think that all these things,

2028
01:53:41.781 --> 01:53:46.520
whether their greed or selfishness or jealousy or fear or lost,

2029
01:53:46.790 --> 01:53:48.030
all of them are,

2030
01:53:48.031 --> 01:53:52.130
are essentially numbers or equations in the,

2031
01:53:52.131 --> 01:53:55.730
in a grand scheme of mathematical,

2032
01:53:56.830 --> 01:54:01.190
like,
what's the word,
not not an algorithm,

2033
01:54:01.340 --> 01:54:06.340
but like a program like literally like every thing that exists,

2034
01:54:07.010 --> 01:54:12.010
whether it's hot or cold or pleasure or pain or all these different things that

2035
01:54:13.160 --> 01:54:18.080
the human animal in any other animal experiences or to guide that animal into a

2036
01:54:18.081 --> 01:54:21.890
certain direction to make sure the deer can keep breathing and staying alive to

2037
01:54:21.891 --> 01:54:24.920
feed all the mountain lions,
it's gotta be difficult to catch it.
Here's a branch,

2038
01:54:24.921 --> 01:54:28.880
snap,
boom.
The ears turn,
they're very big.
They pick up everything.
Why?

2039
01:54:28.881 --> 01:54:29.780
Why is all that there?

2040
01:54:29.781 --> 01:54:32.330
That's all that there is cause that deer better be scared as fuck cause that

2041
01:54:32.331 --> 01:54:34.700
mountain line can run fast bitch.
All right,
you're going to get fucked.

2042
01:54:34.790 --> 01:54:36.680
So if you want to keep reading,
you want to stay alive.

2043
01:54:36.740 --> 01:54:40.620
You have to be a scare fee.
Scaredy cat little deer that freaks out.
Yeah.

2044
01:54:40.870 --> 01:54:44.390
All the shit that we have is designed to make us move and the way that we're

2045
01:54:44.391 --> 01:54:48.840
moving right now,
all of our fears,
anxieties,
greed,
everything.
If I looked at it,

2046
01:54:48.870 --> 01:54:50.780
I look at it as like a program.
I don't,

2047
01:54:50.840 --> 01:54:54.470
I don't look at it as like the universe is going to be feel fearful like we are

2048
01:54:54.471 --> 01:54:56.810
and it is fearful like you are actually scared.

2049
01:54:56.850 --> 01:54:59.840
This is consciousness is like we are.
I don't think that at all.

2050
01:55:00.020 --> 01:55:04.460
I think that we are moving in this very certain direction and we are influenced

2051
01:55:04.461 --> 01:55:08.060
by these very certain feelings and energies and emotions because we have a goal

2052
01:55:08.061 --> 01:55:09.140
to do and we we,

2053
01:55:09.160 --> 01:55:13.190
we were here on some sort of a weird task of accomplishing something,

2054
01:55:13.400 --> 01:55:17.900
taking probably most likely the human animal to the next stage of evolution.

2055
01:55:18.080 --> 01:55:20.510
Whether it's some sort of a symbiotic connection that we're going to have with

2056
01:55:20.511 --> 01:55:21.650
computers,
whatever it is.

2057
01:55:21.800 --> 01:55:26.390
But it seems to me to be progress and technology driven.
All of it,
all of it,

2058
01:55:26.391 --> 01:55:29.900
all the greed and lust and material possessions and everything.

2059
01:55:29.901 --> 01:55:34.310
Everything that that fuels human beings and all this is this existential
wanting,

2060
01:55:34.610 --> 01:55:36.950
you know?
And that I think is because that's,

2061
01:55:36.980 --> 01:55:41.000
that's just like the be swarming around the queen and making a beehive.

2062
01:55:41.030 --> 01:55:44.010
I think it's the same thing.
I think we're,
we're moving in a way

2063
01:55:44.010 --> 01:55:46.460
<v 0>that's far more complex and we have this,
you know,
the,</v>

2064
01:55:46.461 --> 01:55:50.130
the illusion of free will and,
and all these other things that are sort of,

2065
01:55:50.160 --> 01:55:53.790
you know,
guiding us to believe that there's a much more grandiose thing,

2066
01:55:53.820 --> 01:55:55.650
a plan to all.
But this,
these,

2067
01:55:55.651 --> 01:55:59.630
these polls and this ego and fear and death and the longing and loading,

2068
01:55:59.760 --> 01:56:03.450
it might really just be a part of our program that keeps us moving.
What is it?

2069
01:56:03.480 --> 01:56:07.230
What is mechanical?
It,
it's a strange attractor is that idea.

2070
01:56:07.231 --> 01:56:11.070
So it's like there's a magnet in the future,
not to downward for it,

2071
01:56:11.071 --> 01:56:14.220
but there's a thing and if future that's drawing us towards it and causing us to

2072
01:56:14.221 --> 01:56:16.830
organize is it pulls us closer.
Yep.

2073
01:56:16.860 --> 01:56:18.110
<v 4>It's the Omega point daily.</v>

2074
01:56:18.111 --> 01:56:22.290
Our Day Xarden it's like there's a Jesuit priest talked about this too,

2075
01:56:22.291 --> 01:56:23.124
which is that,
right?

2076
01:56:23.150 --> 01:56:26.330
<v 0>There's an organizing principle in the future that's drawing as towards it and</v>

2077
01:56:26.331 --> 01:56:30.420
that sort of like spiral that we're moving towards.
Yeah.
It's a nature.
Yes,

2078
01:56:30.860 --> 01:56:31.640
he had an n.
Yeah,

2079
01:56:31.640 --> 01:56:34.330
but Mckenna had a really interesting way of looking at it because Mckenna,

2080
01:56:34.331 --> 01:56:37.430
his idea was that there is a foregone conclusion.

2081
01:56:37.431 --> 01:56:41.120
There is a an end point that must be reached in that what this,

2082
01:56:41.121 --> 01:56:46.121
this endpoint does is it makes things become more and more complex as they reach

2083
01:56:48.021 --> 01:56:50.660
it,
until it literally manifests itself.

2084
01:56:51.150 --> 01:56:56.030
It's manifesting itself in our innovation and human beings in general in the,

2085
01:56:56.050 --> 01:57:01.050
the massive explosion of change that we have in just a few thousand years have

2086
01:57:01.371 --> 01:57:04.040
imparted on this planet.
Like right now we're booting up,

2087
01:57:04.190 --> 01:57:07.840
but the earth has a computer and it's booting up and it's the,
it's about to go

2088
01:57:07.970 --> 01:57:12.660
<v 4>all along and then it's going to be this.
The next thing.
And I,</v>

2089
01:57:12.680 --> 01:57:14.340
I believe that,
but,
and I,

2090
01:57:14.341 --> 01:57:19.341
I think it's fascinating that the universe as you are in is I am an extrusion

2091
01:57:21.841 --> 01:57:23.970
of,
it talks about it as it's happening.

2092
01:57:24.120 --> 01:57:28.230
The Universe is trying to decode and understand what's happening to it in the

2093
01:57:28.231 --> 01:57:32.040
form of human philosophy and the form of science.

2094
01:57:32.150 --> 01:57:35.390
<v 0>Or maybe it just does like you do when your xenon stage,</v>

2095
01:57:35.420 --> 01:57:36.950
and maybe that's what the universe does.

2096
01:57:36.951 --> 01:57:40.820
Maybe the universe is when you tune into your best moments and you just do,

2097
01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:45.200
you just in that zone you become zen.
Maybe the universe is just ultimate zen.

2098
01:57:45.710 --> 01:57:47.540
What we're doing,
the Dow.
Exactly.

2099
01:57:47.541 --> 01:57:51.350
And what we're doing by tuning into it in little brief moments with brilliant

2100
01:57:51.351 --> 01:57:55.970
music or a great book or an incredible movie or something that just locks into

2101
01:57:55.971 --> 01:58:00.440
it.
Well we're doing is tapping into that groove that you hit when you truly hit

2102
01:58:00.441 --> 01:58:03.110
anything.
Excellent.
And that groove is the universe itself.

2103
01:58:03.290 --> 01:58:06.530
And that the universe has never scared and alone and all that.
That's silly.

2104
01:58:06.531 --> 01:58:10.430
It's Super Zen.
Why can you say,
but it is.
How can you say that?
Well,

2105
01:58:10.431 --> 01:58:13.580
because you know what?
The university,
I'm part of the universe,
so I just saying,

2106
01:58:14.110 --> 01:58:18.950
isn't it your fear?
I can tell you this,
this little stretch of the universe here,

2107
01:58:19.130 --> 01:58:21.440
sometimes it gets scared and feels lonely.
Well,

2108
01:58:21.441 --> 01:58:24.050
this little stretch of the universe is its own little thing,

2109
01:58:24.290 --> 01:58:26.180
but it's still part of the universe,
but it's just a little,

2110
01:58:26.270 --> 01:58:29.000
a little segment that got accomplished.
Got It.

2111
01:58:30.190 --> 01:58:33.210
It's got a a a task.
No,
you don't think that that's,

2112
01:58:33.360 --> 01:58:38.360
there's like all like sort of really pragmatic reasons for fears and for lust

2113
01:58:39.591 --> 01:58:41.410
and for desires goals.

2114
01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:46.100
<v 4>I think their reason doesn't that I think I where it seems like we're where</v>

2115
01:58:46.101 --> 01:58:48.900
we're,
I don't know if it's a disagreement,
but my,

2116
01:58:48.940 --> 01:58:52.160
my conception of it is it human beings,

2117
01:58:52.190 --> 01:58:56.600
just like any other thing in the world,
in the universe,
in space,

2118
01:58:56.630 --> 01:58:59.630
he's part of the university.
And as part of the universe,

2119
01:58:59.900 --> 01:59:01.700
that means that the experience,

2120
01:59:01.701 --> 01:59:06.680
the individual experience that you're having is a part of the universe.

2121
01:59:06.890 --> 01:59:10.100
Having the experience now,
the reasons that you're having the experience,

2122
01:59:10.101 --> 01:59:14.450
don't dis,
don't,
uh,
take away the fact that you're experiencing it.

2123
01:59:14.451 --> 01:59:17.180
So what I mean is if you're happy,

2124
01:59:17.660 --> 01:59:22.660
then you are one tiny little pixel of the universe experiencing happiness.

2125
01:59:23.660 --> 01:59:28.460
If you're scared,
you're one tiny little pixel of the universe experiencing fear,

2126
01:59:28.880 --> 01:59:29.440
you know,

2127
01:59:29.440 --> 01:59:32.400
<v 0>and that sounds like a nice cop out.
It's not be a pussy.
You're like,</v>

2128
01:59:32.510 --> 01:59:35.680
I'm not really a pussy.
It's the university university being a pussy through me.

2129
01:59:36.100 --> 01:59:38.920
That's hilarious.
The Ute I am,

2130
01:59:38.921 --> 01:59:42.580
while I'm crying is not a buzzy.
No,
you are.

2131
01:59:43.430 --> 01:59:47.140
I used to always say
waterfalls.

2132
01:59:49.600 --> 01:59:51.680
You automatically,
uh,

2133
01:59:51.790 --> 01:59:56.790
associated the universal consciousness with fear and terror.

2134
01:59:57.070 --> 01:59:57.401
And I,

2135
01:59:57.401 --> 02:00:01.270
and I think you're justifying it in a backdoor situation by saying that you're a

2136
02:00:01.271 --> 02:00:02.460
piece of the universe.
You,

2137
02:00:02.461 --> 02:00:04.600
you were talking about the universe being one consciousness.

2138
02:00:04.601 --> 02:00:06.980
We weren't talking about any human beings existing.
What do you think?

2139
02:00:06.990 --> 02:00:08.260
I don't know.
Dominators no.

2140
02:00:08.261 --> 02:00:11.740
If there's no goal that the human being has to achieve and if there's no

2141
02:00:11.741 --> 02:00:14.680
conscious awareness of the temporary existence of its lifespan,

2142
02:00:14.800 --> 02:00:18.250
because it's not a lifespan,
it's not alive.
It is universal consciousness.

2143
02:00:18.251 --> 02:00:21.190
That is the universe.
Why the fuck would it be scared?
That's my point.

2144
02:00:21.360 --> 02:00:21.900
<v 4>Well,</v>

2145
02:00:21.900 --> 02:00:26.900
I think the predominant mood on this planet is one of fear and,

2146
02:00:28.050 --> 02:00:32.740
<v 0>Oh man,
I can't,
I couldn't disagree more.
I can't remember any more.
Yeah.</v>

2147
02:00:32.760 --> 02:00:36.960
I think people were freaked out.
No Man,
people,
some people are freaked out.

2148
02:00:37.110 --> 02:00:39.480
Part of people are freaked out part of the day,

2149
02:00:39.630 --> 02:00:42.330
but if you added up 24 hours in the day and all of the people,

2150
02:00:42.480 --> 02:00:46.260
most people aren't,
it's not fucking mad max out there,
man.
It ain't that bad.

2151
02:00:46.290 --> 02:00:46.860
Oh No.

2152
02:00:46.860 --> 02:00:48.660
<v 4>But Mad Max,
that kind of fear,</v>

2153
02:00:48.661 --> 02:00:51.990
it would be better than the kind of fear that's infected people these days.

2154
02:00:52.110 --> 02:00:53.340
They kind of fear that's infected.

2155
02:00:53.341 --> 02:00:57.840
People these days is far worse than fighting some fucking Max bandit with a

2156
02:00:57.841 --> 02:01:02.160
flame thrower.
The fear,
the fear that people experience and not,
okay.

2157
02:01:02.161 --> 02:01:04.170
What fear of define [inaudible],

2158
02:01:04.290 --> 02:01:08.080
<v 0>what fear are they experiencing all day?
Turn on the fucking watch the company.</v>

2159
02:01:08.090 --> 02:01:09.740
Is it all newsman?
Cause no,
nothing new.

2160
02:01:09.770 --> 02:01:12.450
A lot of people out there having a good time.
I've met him,
man.

2161
02:01:12.451 --> 02:01:16.180
We were in Ontario,
California this weekend.
Had a great fucking time.
I meet,

2162
02:01:16.200 --> 02:01:20.160
I meet people having a great time too.
It's not the predominant mood is not fear.

2163
02:01:20.190 --> 02:01:22.350
Fear is an element in this world.
No doubt.
Okay.

2164
02:01:22.590 --> 02:01:23.430
<v 4>I think people are,</v>

2165
02:01:23.460 --> 02:01:27.900
I think a lot of people are scared.

2166
02:01:28.450 --> 02:01:33.100
<v 0>Yes.
But they're also happy and they're all also horny and they're also drunk.</v>

2167
02:01:33.101 --> 02:01:36.190
And you know,
there's a lot of different room on the dial.

2168
02:01:36.250 --> 02:01:37.390
There's room on the dial phones,

2169
02:01:37.420 --> 02:01:39.650
different emotions to say the predominant one is fear.

2170
02:01:39.680 --> 02:01:44.240
That's the primary in this country.
Really.
I think in this country,
man,
he look,

2171
02:01:44.250 --> 02:01:47.960
it's the times are hard just like all over the world.
[inaudible] orange,

2172
02:01:48.380 --> 02:01:51.860
they don't even do that anymore,
but they did it for a long time.
Okay.

2173
02:01:51.861 --> 02:01:52.370
But I don't,

2174
02:01:52.370 --> 02:01:56.300
I think that people are can dwell on that shit and it makes it way worse than it

2175
02:01:56.301 --> 02:01:58.580
really is.
I think for sure there's some fear out there.

2176
02:01:58.581 --> 02:02:01.490
But to say that it's the predominant emotion of people that are living their

2177
02:02:01.520 --> 02:02:02.241
everyday lives,

2178
02:02:02.241 --> 02:02:06.290
working and having sex and playing with their children and going to the movies.

2179
02:02:06.470 --> 02:02:09.800
I don't think the primary one is fear.
I think it's in there,

2180
02:02:09.890 --> 02:02:14.270
but I think fear and it's definitely not as much as it was after nine 11 you

2181
02:02:14.271 --> 02:02:17.280
know,
and shit like that.
I think if anything it's you,

2182
02:02:17.290 --> 02:02:20.680
you tend to lean towards the morose and either do line,

2183
02:02:20.720 --> 02:02:24.830
but you're applying these thoughts to the whole of humanity.

2184
02:02:24.831 --> 02:02:27.560
I don't mean it is a hopeless thing though.
I don't mean it is,

2185
02:02:27.570 --> 02:02:29.870
I don't mean fear as a hopeless thing.
Not at all.

2186
02:02:30.260 --> 02:02:32.750
I think you got to acknowledge it.
I don't know man.

2187
02:02:32.751 --> 02:02:35.780
But you don't have to acknowledge it.
If you just living life,
enjoying yourself,

2188
02:02:35.781 --> 02:02:38.120
go to Hawaii and see how people just chilling at the beach.

2189
02:02:38.500 --> 02:02:41.360
Do you know what it's like to live in Hawaii?
Is someone living in Hawaii?

2190
02:02:41.660 --> 02:02:44.450
Look it up.
They call it like the golden cage.

2191
02:02:44.570 --> 02:02:48.790
It's so fucking expensive to live there.
That to,
to,
to to,

2192
02:02:48.830 --> 02:02:51.920
you have to work like two or three jobs.
If you're a native Hawaiian,

2193
02:02:51.921 --> 02:02:55.670
it's really tough there.
So I mean,
maybe fear is the wrong word for it.

2194
02:02:55.671 --> 02:02:58.150
What does that have to do with just chill out?
Well,
no,

2195
02:02:58.190 --> 02:03:01.010
there's people on the culture is like a chilled out culture is what I'm saying.

2196
02:03:01.011 --> 02:03:03.880
I think there's tourists on the beach,
but also like,
what was it?

2197
02:03:04.040 --> 02:03:06.960
I feel like I'm to defend myself.
I feel like I'm going to have,
I'm dry,

2198
02:03:07.010 --> 02:03:10.410
I'm driving deeper and deeper into a pessimistic place.
And,

2199
02:03:10.411 --> 02:03:14.600
and I think that maybe the way that I chose my words is like not exactly

2200
02:03:14.601 --> 02:03:18.760
straight.
Sometimes in absolutes.
All right.
You know,
and I think you,
you,

2201
02:03:18.761 --> 02:03:22.200
you chase down an idea.
And I do,
I'm guilty as well.
Um,

2202
02:03:22.220 --> 02:03:25.430
you chase down an idea and sometime in chasing down that idea,

2203
02:03:25.450 --> 02:03:30.450
you discard or discount possible other ideas that might interfere with the path

2204
02:03:30.861 --> 02:03:33.920
that you're on.
You know?
And that is something that a lot of people do.

2205
02:03:33.921 --> 02:03:36.000
I do it too.
You know,
it's,
it's dissolved.

2206
02:03:36.150 --> 02:03:40.340
I wanted just to finish the thought what I was trying to get at doing it right

2207
02:03:40.341 --> 02:03:45.140
there.
I want to dissolve.
You want it to dissolve the fucking dissolve.

2208
02:03:45.200 --> 02:03:48.230
The fear and underneath that is love is love.

2209
02:03:48.231 --> 02:03:52.910
I think what I'm saying is I don't think the universe has any fucking fear at

2210
02:03:52.911 --> 02:03:55.480
all.
I think if the universe was a universal consciousness,
well,

2211
02:03:55.520 --> 02:03:58.700
one thing that knew everything and had,
and it was by itself,
I did,

2212
02:03:58.760 --> 02:04:02.660
I don't think it would tweak,
you know,
because I don't think it needs to be,
uh,

2213
02:04:02.840 --> 02:04:06.080
in the buddy system.
I think it's the fucking universe.
The universe is good.

2214
02:04:06.110 --> 02:04:10.850
Our fears that we have that are all biological and all of our fears that we have

2215
02:04:10.851 --> 02:04:14.390
about being alone and all pharaoh's about dying,
they're all biological.

2216
02:04:14.480 --> 02:04:18.450
They're all just these fail safe mechanisms designed to keep us running.
But the,

2217
02:04:18.480 --> 02:04:21.320
the university as a whole.
Okay.

2218
02:04:21.321 --> 02:04:24.650
The university as a whole and understanding that this poll is freaking out,

2219
02:04:24.651 --> 02:04:28.150
but as individual units it definitely,
parts of it aren't freaking out.

2220
02:04:28.170 --> 02:04:32.090
You not understand that you are applying individual units or something that you

2221
02:04:32.091 --> 02:04:34.010
initially said has no individual units.

2222
02:04:34.220 --> 02:04:38.100
The first thing you were saying was the universe would be nothing.
There was

2223
02:04:38.100 --> 02:04:40.910
<v 4>nothing that big bang.
I'm glad you said this.</v>

2224
02:04:40.920 --> 02:04:45.780
It lets me throw out an esoteric can do words and he said this.
Okay,
what is it?

2225
02:04:45.810 --> 02:04:48.780
The word is,
and I'm probably going to mispronounce it,
the word is a sink,

2226
02:04:48.781 --> 02:04:53.560
a sink of Beta Tada.
And what that word translates into is simultaneous oneness.

2227
02:04:53.610 --> 02:04:56.790
Indifference,
which is the explanation they give for the universe,

2228
02:04:56.791 --> 02:04:59.470
which is its existing,
uh,

2229
02:04:59.550 --> 02:05:03.450
as an entirety as a whole is a good start is one thing.

2230
02:05:03.750 --> 02:05:06.420
But also while it's existing as this one thing,

2231
02:05:06.421 --> 02:05:10.650
it's existing as infinite number of units,
units that are making it up.

2232
02:05:11.040 --> 02:05:15.570
And so those units that are making up the sum total,
some of those units,

2233
02:05:15.720 --> 02:05:16.890
their experiences,

2234
02:05:17.130 --> 02:05:21.210
one of fear or one of anger or the more negative emotions and whether or not

2235
02:05:21.211 --> 02:05:24.680
this is a biological imperative,
let's imagine humans didn't even exist it off.

2236
02:05:24.690 --> 02:05:28.230
It's just squirrels,
then the,
the or,
or animals.

2237
02:05:28.380 --> 02:05:33.240
Then those animals are still parts of the universe experiencing this certain

2238
02:05:33.241 --> 02:05:33.910
emotion.

2239
02:05:33.910 --> 02:05:36.910
<v 0>Right.
But isn't that just so that they can keep breeding is,</v>

2240
02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:40.570
are these just electrical signals that trigger certain behavior patterns that

2241
02:05:40.571 --> 02:05:44.020
allow them to continue to keep their little cycle or whatever the fuck they are

2242
02:05:44.021 --> 02:05:47.110
there for?
Whether they are to cultivate the ground so the trees grow better.

2243
02:05:47.170 --> 02:05:48.050
So they,
they,
you know,

2244
02:05:48.070 --> 02:05:52.000
they complete their cycles to dig an at the ground or whether they're the,

2245
02:05:52.001 --> 02:05:53.410
the human animal that,
you know,

2246
02:05:53.411 --> 02:05:56.560
that fucking sparks the atom that blows up the fucking earth.
Yes.
You know,

2247
02:05:56.800 --> 02:06:00.500
whatever it is that all these moves that they do in,
in,

2248
02:06:00.780 --> 02:06:03.810
<v 4>there's no real fear.
It doesn't exist.
It's,
it's,
it's a,</v>

2249
02:06:03.811 --> 02:06:06.980
it's a charge on the game,
uh,

2250
02:06:07.750 --> 02:06:11.280
an influence on the game.
It's still,
I mean,
you,
well,
let's,

2251
02:06:11.310 --> 02:06:14.370
why don't you know why I have to use the word fear.
Let's say it's like,
you know,

2252
02:06:14.460 --> 02:06:18.390
orgasm because they experience of orgasm is a chemical reaction that's part of

2253
02:06:18.391 --> 02:06:21.960
some grand,
um,
uh,
equation.

2254
02:06:21.961 --> 02:06:25.770
Working itself out doesn't negate the fact that orgasms exist or that they're

2255
02:06:25.800 --> 02:06:30.780
there.
They're obviously real.
So it is a,
it's a,
it's a real thing,
you know,

2256
02:06:30.781 --> 02:06:35.220
and whether or not we feel fear because we're in some predetermined,
uh,

2257
02:06:35.760 --> 02:06:39.360
we're in some predetermined thing that's working itself out or whether or not we

2258
02:06:39.361 --> 02:06:41.510
feel fear because we're,
um,

2259
02:06:41.610 --> 02:06:46.050
<v 0>well,
fear is a motivator man.
Right?
It's really simple.
I mean,
we,
we,
we,
we have,</v>

2260
02:06:46.080 --> 02:06:49.770
uh,
a lot of investment in fear.
We have a lot of investment in love.

2261
02:06:49.771 --> 02:06:52.560
We have a lot of investment in all these things that are just motivators that,

2262
02:06:52.620 --> 02:06:55.980
you know,
they,
they,
they push us in certain directions,
keep us from things,

2263
02:06:56.130 --> 02:06:59.790
keep us,
you know,
you,
you learn from a bark,
bark,
bark animal can kill you,

2264
02:06:59.910 --> 02:07:03.750
run away.
You know,
you're scared of dogs.
This is,
there's all these things exist.

2265
02:07:03.751 --> 02:07:06.970
They're just,
they just move action.
Yeah.
They're just motivators.
Right.

2266
02:07:06.980 --> 02:07:10.170
I'm in no way trying to say that I understand the consciousness of the universe.

2267
02:07:10.290 --> 02:07:13.290
I'm in no way trying to say that.
You know I'm right and you're wrong.

2268
02:07:13.440 --> 02:07:17.550
What I'm trying to say is you automatically assume that the universe has fear

2269
02:07:17.551 --> 02:07:18.480
because it has consciousness.

2270
02:07:18.950 --> 02:07:21.880
<v 4>I thought that was really telling.
I don't mean to keep going back to this point,</v>

2271
02:07:21.881 --> 02:07:24.940
but the reason that,
oh,
right.
Oh yes.
I see what you're saying.

2272
02:07:24.970 --> 02:07:28.720
Then with the initial idea that the first thing that you would feel,

2273
02:07:28.750 --> 02:07:30.970
that's what you say,
you attached yourself.

2274
02:07:30.971 --> 02:07:33.200
What does that call to answer promoters when you,
you ask,

2275
02:07:33.210 --> 02:07:37.630
you think I projected my guys.
I made the ultimate that.
Okay,

2276
02:07:37.840 --> 02:07:38.790
so I get it.
Fear.

2277
02:07:38.830 --> 02:07:43.830
I made the ultimate narcissistic error rejecting narcissistic in what happens

2278
02:07:45.041 --> 02:07:49.150
when a baby pops out of a pussy for the first time they cry.
They freak out.
Yeah.

2279
02:07:49.151 --> 02:07:52.720
It's cause they changed environments a fucking cry.
So in that same way,

2280
02:07:52.721 --> 02:07:56.860
I think that when the universe first popped out,
this universal consciousness,

2281
02:07:56.861 --> 02:08:01.000
and I also must say that I do not know this.
Again,

2282
02:08:01.120 --> 02:08:02.770
to go back to the original point I made,

2283
02:08:02.771 --> 02:08:07.120
this happened while I was drooling onto my desk in a science class on acid,

2284
02:08:07.300 --> 02:08:10.480
but I think that the initial burst of the universe,

2285
02:08:10.750 --> 02:08:13.840
that feeling would be very similar to a baby crying.

2286
02:08:14.230 --> 02:08:18.460
What the fuck?
What the fuck?

2287
02:08:18.490 --> 02:08:21.370
And it would break into a billion pieces with that.

2288
02:08:21.640 --> 02:08:26.640
What the fuck and that what the fuck is encapsulated and every single person and

2289
02:08:27.641 --> 02:08:30.400
it's our life task and maybe this purpose you're talking about,

2290
02:08:30.580 --> 02:08:31.810
maybe we agree on this point.

2291
02:08:31.990 --> 02:08:36.990
It's our life task to turn that what the fuck into this is awesome.

2292
02:08:37.690 --> 02:08:40.540
This is amazing.
Oh my God,
this is,

2293
02:08:40.600 --> 02:08:44.740
this is the best thing that could ever happen and maybe is that feeling begins

2294
02:08:44.741 --> 02:08:47.980
to escalate inside of people,
which are parts of the universe.

2295
02:08:48.130 --> 02:08:51.730
Then maybe it'll keep escalating and escalating and escalating to the universe

2296
02:08:51.731 --> 02:08:56.680
goes into this like amazing cascade into like eternal bliss,

2297
02:08:56.920 --> 02:08:58.150
eternal happiness,

2298
02:08:58.330 --> 02:09:02.260
a bliss that we can't even imagine that keeps exponentially increasing and

2299
02:09:02.261 --> 02:09:06.580
increasing and increasing and increasing.
And we're just one tiny node on this.

2300
02:09:06.581 --> 02:09:10.990
A movement towards that.
Both wrong.
What's the answer?
I don't know.

2301
02:09:11.050 --> 02:09:13.620
Prove me right
Brian.

2302
02:09:13.950 --> 02:09:14.161
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

2303
02:09:14.161 --> 02:09:17.250
but you guys are just talking to like for like 40 minutes on stuff that you both

2304
02:09:17.251 --> 02:09:20.910
can't be right or wrong with that.
No,
there's no right or wrong a unquestionably.

2305
02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:24.150
What's wrong with my problem is you as a person,

2306
02:09:24.180 --> 02:09:29.160
I know you very well and you lean towards fear.
You know,
and you,
you,
you,

2307
02:09:29.161 --> 02:09:30.080
you have,
you know,

2308
02:09:30.260 --> 02:09:33.390
you're a very intelligent person and intelligent people for the most part are

2309
02:09:33.391 --> 02:09:36.960
more scared of things because you realize the variables,
you know and you,

2310
02:09:36.961 --> 02:09:41.520
you think of,
you know,
you think of it.
Think of a negative results.

2311
02:09:41.670 --> 02:09:42.580
When you were thinking,

2312
02:09:42.680 --> 02:09:46.830
you were talking about people and by the way folks sending mean messages on

2313
02:09:46.831 --> 02:09:50.590
Twitter.
We're not.
No one's arguing.
We're just talking.
And he's like,

2314
02:09:50.640 --> 02:09:54.420
what are people saying do to,
can talk?
You know,

2315
02:09:54.421 --> 02:09:58.800
you're not as open minded as you sound,
man.
We're throwing ideas.
No,
this is fun.

2316
02:09:59.560 --> 02:10:02.850
It's like,
I understand what we're doing.
We're,
we're throwing ideas around,

2317
02:10:02.880 --> 02:10:05.880
and I'm not saying that I'm writing,
I'm fucking for sure not right.

2318
02:10:06.060 --> 02:10:09.810
But what I'm saying is yet you can't,
it can't just say,
you know,

2319
02:10:09.990 --> 02:10:13.380
you can't say the universe has fear.
You can't say it's,
you know,

2320
02:10:13.410 --> 02:10:15.300
he can't eat these,

2321
02:10:15.301 --> 02:10:19.650
these subjects are so fucking twisted in bizarre that no one can have an

2322
02:10:19.651 --> 02:10:21.690
absolutely.
You know,
why are there so

2323
02:10:21.780 --> 02:10:25.290
<v 4>fun to talk about?
And that's something,
Brian,
you seem to like,
you don't</v>

2324
02:10:25.440 --> 02:10:28.080
<v 0>checkout.
I hate what efs,
you don't want you wasting your time.</v>

2325
02:10:28.140 --> 02:10:31.740
Like fake trying to figure that out.
You know,
going back and forth.
I got it.

2326
02:10:31.940 --> 02:10:34.100
I think it's,
you can't say it's your time because it's very

2327
02:10:34.100 --> 02:10:35.840
<v 5>entertaining.
It's entertaining,</v>

2328
02:10:35.860 --> 02:10:39.350
but there's no way into it because there's no answer to why does it have to have

2329
02:10:39.351 --> 02:10:42.470
an end?
Because that's how my mind thinks.
I want to figure out how shit works.

2330
02:10:42.471 --> 02:10:45.530
I don't want to fucking like,
that's just like wasting your time,
you know?

2331
02:10:45.620 --> 02:10:50.210
I'm not going to need to know what the secret to the life and universities have

2332
02:10:50.211 --> 02:10:52.670
as conscious.
If it's like a baby popping out giant,

2333
02:10:53.620 --> 02:10:54.830
how are you supposed to be spent?

2334
02:10:54.860 --> 02:10:57.110
How do you think you're supposed to be spending your time?
Uh,

2335
02:10:57.440 --> 02:11:00.320
trying to live in the now instead of living on something you will never figure

2336
02:11:00.321 --> 02:11:04.400
it out.
But part of living in,
but it's can,
it's interesting,

2337
02:11:04.401 --> 02:11:06.050
but there's no one's right or wrong though.
That's just,

2338
02:11:07.550 --> 02:11:09.430
that doesn't mean that you shouldn't have a cigarette.

2339
02:11:09.500 --> 02:11:12.170
That's why I think that's what I think I know.
So when you guys talk at what if,

2340
02:11:12.180 --> 02:11:15.050
so I just feel like I keep away from everything really deep though.

2341
02:11:15.051 --> 02:11:19.790
Even if it's not what is
making them stories that you think are right,

2342
02:11:19.820 --> 02:11:21.290
which aren't because you don't know.

2343
02:11:23.270 --> 02:11:24.021
<v 3>No Man,
listen,</v>

2344
02:11:24.021 --> 02:11:26.810
he's not just what iffing when he's talking about a human being being a

2345
02:11:26.811 --> 02:11:28.530
representative of the universe,
because it's

2346
02:11:28.630 --> 02:11:33.610
<v 5>part of,
it's true.
It is true.
I agree with that.
Absolutely.
Agree with that,</v>

2347
02:11:33.611 --> 02:11:36.610
but that doesn't mean that that,
that the universe has feelings.

2348
02:11:36.670 --> 02:11:39.880
You don't have feelings because you're part of the universe.
All right.

2349
02:11:39.970 --> 02:11:41.480
If you say it like that,
that means to tense.

2350
02:11:41.880 --> 02:11:45.100
That's what if you're calling and you're saying no,
you're saying,
well,

2351
02:11:45.101 --> 02:11:46.300
you're part of the university.

2352
02:11:46.320 --> 02:11:49.110
It goes back to what I was saying like a drum circle believe.
Do

2353
02:11:49.110 --> 02:11:53.130
<v 3>you believe it's possible that we are all our own universe and that somehow or</v>

2354
02:11:53.131 --> 02:11:56.460
another,
this isn't something that you can bang on with a hammer.
It's not.

2355
02:11:56.710 --> 02:12:00.750
The whole world isn't the material world of of things being solid,

2356
02:12:00.870 --> 02:12:05.760
but there is some sort of a fictional aspect to life and that it almost is like

2357
02:12:05.850 --> 02:12:10.410
your imagination and your mind and your,
your,
your,
your,
you know,

2358
02:12:10.440 --> 02:12:15.440
just your intent really does have some effect on physical reality and that all

2359
02:12:15.781 --> 02:12:19.830
of our physical reality is all of these seem to be the exact same thing that

2360
02:12:19.831 --> 02:12:21.120
were all inserted into.

2361
02:12:21.240 --> 02:12:25.560
We all have our own unique oneness and that are unique.
One.

2362
02:12:25.561 --> 02:12:27.860
This interacts with everyone else's unique one is,

2363
02:12:27.960 --> 02:12:32.040
which is why it's very important to surround yourself with positive people.

2364
02:12:32.130 --> 02:12:35.700
Then you surround yourself with a bunch of positive universes.

2365
02:12:35.820 --> 02:12:40.350
You create more and more positive energy,
more and more positive experiences.

2366
02:12:40.500 --> 02:12:43.440
More and more good things are happening to all the people around you.

2367
02:12:43.441 --> 02:12:46.950
More and more happiness is total interchange between each other.

2368
02:12:47.190 --> 02:12:49.830
That's how you really make a real community.
Right?
Right.
Yeah.

2369
02:12:49.831 --> 02:12:52.470
It's your association and so important and your own.
You're,

2370
02:12:52.471 --> 02:12:55.970
you're making a community,
making your own universe.
Man.
Did you have you?

2371
02:12:55.971 --> 02:12:59.840
I'm practically and Willie,
you know,
cause practically it's,

2372
02:12:59.841 --> 02:13:02.190
it's just a smart thing to surround yourself with good people,

2373
02:13:02.340 --> 02:13:03.790
but the idea that you don't,

2374
02:13:03.970 --> 02:13:08.970
we're not exactly sure with this fuzzy line between consciousness and

2375
02:13:09.330 --> 02:13:14.330
unconsciousness and sleeping and dreaming and it's all going on and on in one

2376
02:13:14.371 --> 02:13:16.610
cycle,
but we're not exactly sure what,
what,

2377
02:13:16.630 --> 02:13:20.670
what part of it we're playing all the time.
We have to hit on things to be sure.

2378
02:13:21.260 --> 02:13:23.540
You mean how many times have you had dreams where you,
oh,

2379
02:13:23.550 --> 02:13:26.760
it's a dream or to dream.
Oh,
it's a dream.

2380
02:13:26.850 --> 02:13:29.340
How do you not know that knocking out of things isn't a fucking dream.

2381
02:13:29.520 --> 02:13:31.800
That the whole idea that you dream,

2382
02:13:31.920 --> 02:13:34.560
the idea that you could imagine the idea that there's some,

2383
02:13:35.130 --> 02:13:39.780
some mystical part of your brain that sees things that aren't really there and

2384
02:13:39.781 --> 02:13:43.320
puts them into position and moves them around and gives you a little fucking

2385
02:13:43.321 --> 02:13:47.100
cartoon light bulb and then you write this down and you get together with a

2386
02:13:47.101 --> 02:13:48.540
hammer and nail and some fucking wood,

2387
02:13:48.630 --> 02:13:50.760
and you create this thing that's never been created before.

2388
02:13:50.850 --> 02:13:52.050
What the fuck is that?

2389
02:13:52.200 --> 02:13:55.770
This is something that's manifesting itself in a solid form that it's come out

2390
02:13:55.771 --> 02:14:00.450
of nowhere.
Yeah.
I have a feeling that whole nowhere is a real realm.

2391
02:14:00.780 --> 02:14:04.770
The realm of thinking,
the realm of consciousness and imagination.

2392
02:14:04.920 --> 02:14:08.370
Just because you can't bang on it with a fucking hammer doesn't mean it's not a

2393
02:14:08.371 --> 02:14:12.870
real realm.
A real,
a huge part of the ingredients of life.

2394
02:14:13.320 --> 02:14:17.370
And I think that we only measure the shit that we can bang on with a hammer and

2395
02:14:17.371 --> 02:14:20.320
we look at the way that people are influenced their lives.
You know,
she'll,

2396
02:14:20.321 --> 02:14:22.300
she'll get a tech job and look what she did to her lips.
We,

2397
02:14:22.350 --> 02:14:26.010
we look at all the different things that you physically do to the stuff that you

2398
02:14:26.011 --> 02:14:28.050
can hit.
That's what we measure.

2399
02:14:28.110 --> 02:14:31.170
And we decide that that's the entire ingredient list of life.

2400
02:14:31.470 --> 02:14:33.960
And I don't think it is,
man.
I think there's some,

2401
02:14:34.170 --> 02:14:36.570
there's some woo woo shit going on man.

2402
02:14:37.080 --> 02:14:40.890
There's some woowoo Depok shopper type shit going on that seems ridiculous.

2403
02:14:41.010 --> 02:14:42.120
You just can't measure it.

2404
02:14:42.130 --> 02:14:43.270
<v 4>You know what they call it?
You know the,</v>

2405
02:14:43.271 --> 02:14:46.450
of course the name for the universe that is Maya.

2406
02:14:46.451 --> 02:14:49.360
You've heard the term [inaudible] of course.
Illusion.
So like it's,

2407
02:14:49.570 --> 02:14:53.740
and I think there's like exercises and some yoga systems where you begin to try

2408
02:14:53.741 --> 02:14:56.130
to deconstruct what exactly what you're saying.
You,

2409
02:14:56.131 --> 02:15:00.220
you start like trying to like find what is real,
what Israel,
you know,
is this,

2410
02:15:00.370 --> 02:15:03.040
for example,
this table,
like you take the table for example,

2411
02:15:03.041 --> 02:15:06.100
the table is only real in this moment right now.

2412
02:15:06.101 --> 02:15:08.890
If you were to look at the table through the,
uh,

2413
02:15:09.040 --> 02:15:11.260
through the course of thousands and thousands of years,

2414
02:15:11.261 --> 02:15:15.470
you would see this table was trees and before it was trees,
it was seeds.

2415
02:15:15.471 --> 02:15:16.271
And before it was seeds,

2416
02:15:16.271 --> 02:15:20.710
there's this combination of carbon molecules and you would see that this table

2417
02:15:20.711 --> 02:15:25.270
is only existing in a very temporary transient moment.
And this one second,

2418
02:15:25.271 --> 02:15:27.010
it's almost liquid.
If you look at time,

2419
02:15:27.011 --> 02:15:32.011
it's just kind of wave this undulation that's happening that we mistake it as a

2420
02:15:32.201 --> 02:15:35.140
solid,
right?
And so we think,
Oh yes,
this is permanent and this is real.
It's like,

2421
02:15:35.280 --> 02:15:37.930
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
This is completely impermanent.

2422
02:15:37.931 --> 02:15:40.270
You just happened to see it as real on this one second.

2423
02:15:40.510 --> 02:15:43.660
And so you begin to be like,
okay,
well that's not real.
Then you begin to think,

2424
02:15:43.661 --> 02:15:46.260
well what about me?
Am I,
what am I?
And then you're also,

2425
02:15:46.270 --> 02:15:50.770
you're part of that fucking paint swirl to your swirled in with a table right

2426
02:15:50.771 --> 02:15:55.090
now.
Your swirled in and before you swirled into the human entity that you are,

2427
02:15:55.300 --> 02:15:57.670
you are a bunch of other shit,
you know you are,

2428
02:15:57.970 --> 02:16:01.810
you are ultimately like they talk about how like parts of what's inside of us is

2429
02:16:01.811 --> 02:16:06.010
from supernovas and quasars and things exploding.

2430
02:16:06.770 --> 02:16:07.750
Start us.
Yeah.

2431
02:16:08.010 --> 02:16:11.020
<v 3>We did have to have a Supernova to make the shift to make people right.
Yes.</v>

2432
02:16:11.021 --> 02:16:13.600
You need it.
Some sort of a fucking explosion of a star.

2433
02:16:13.650 --> 02:16:15.930
<v 4>That's the recipe and so when you start,</v>

2434
02:16:16.200 --> 02:16:20.310
instead of just theoretically talking about it like what you don't like,

2435
02:16:20.430 --> 02:16:21.900
if you start like really thinking,
okay,

2436
02:16:21.901 --> 02:16:25.380
well then what does that mean for my life?
How am I supposed to,
you know,

2437
02:16:25.410 --> 02:16:26.910
how am I supposed to start acting?

2438
02:16:26.911 --> 02:16:30.040
Then if I realize that I'm just some infinite part

2439
02:16:30.040 --> 02:16:33.790
<v 1>of something else,
it's going to swirl back out and then nothingness real quick.</v>

2440
02:16:33.820 --> 02:16:37.420
What do you think the guy first felt when he realized that the sun has a

2441
02:16:37.421 --> 02:16:38.254
lifespan?

2442
02:16:38.470 --> 02:16:41.890
The Guy who first realize that eventually this fucker's going to go out.
Right.

2443
02:16:41.891 --> 02:16:42.160
You know,

2444
02:16:42.160 --> 02:16:44.940
when he calculated how many billionaires when you have lung transplant are all

2445
02:16:44.950 --> 02:16:46.750
fine,
you know,
and then they figured out,
you know,

2446
02:16:46.751 --> 02:16:51.100
most sons only live to 500 million years.
Did you know that?
No,
I didn't.
No,

2447
02:16:51.101 --> 02:16:54.500
I didn't know that either.
I thought like they're all billions.
Billions of years.

2448
02:16:54.840 --> 02:16:58.480
No,
no,
no,
no.
Most sons,
500 billion years or 500 million years.
Really?
Yeah.

2449
02:16:58.510 --> 02:17:01.810
So we got an older son,
a crazy slow burning sun.

2450
02:17:01.811 --> 02:17:05.290
Some of them just fucking blast off.
Some of the really big giant ones,
man,

2451
02:17:05.380 --> 02:17:08.650
they're just fucking blah.
They just rage for like a,
you know,

2452
02:17:08.651 --> 02:17:11.740
a few million years and then shut the fuck off.
Yeah.
But some of them,

2453
02:17:11.750 --> 02:17:13.840
a lot of them die out at 500 million.

2454
02:17:13.990 --> 02:17:18.130
So we're in a rare sort of a goldilocks situation where life can get this

2455
02:17:18.131 --> 02:17:22.570
advanced and get this complex,
you know,
4.6 billion years or something like that.

2456
02:17:23.100 --> 02:17:26.710
This planet has been around in the sun is even older than that.
You know,

2457
02:17:26.740 --> 02:17:30.200
pretty fascinating stuff.
When you really stop and think about it,
you know what,

2458
02:17:30.250 --> 02:17:32.890
that's all got a lifespan,
that fucking,

2459
02:17:32.891 --> 02:17:37.891
that level of thinking that you can begin to like really start experiencing like

2460
02:17:38.140 --> 02:17:39.550
novelty again in your life.

2461
02:17:39.551 --> 02:17:42.040
Cause I think people get shut off to that way of thinking.

2462
02:17:42.041 --> 02:17:44.110
They don't want to think like that and things can get boring.

2463
02:17:44.260 --> 02:17:45.640
It's like when you sit,

2464
02:17:45.700 --> 02:17:50.700
when you go outside in a hot day and you just think I'm experiencing heat from a

2465
02:17:51.941 --> 02:17:53.680
fucking thing in space.

2466
02:17:53.681 --> 02:17:56.810
Like this heat is radiating out of this thing that's so fucking hot.

2467
02:17:56.811 --> 02:18:01.060
It's making its way through space and changing my skin color a little bit.

2468
02:18:01.061 --> 02:18:02.200
It can burn my skin.

2469
02:18:02.830 --> 02:18:07.330
That's to me that if I allow myself to think that way things become so much more

2470
02:18:07.331 --> 02:18:09.700
fascinating and interesting.
It's just weird.

2471
02:18:09.701 --> 02:18:13.000
The stuff you choose to not use specifically that people

2472
02:18:14.440 --> 02:18:16.960
<v 5>yeah,
but that's not what you guys were talking about you and talking about,</v>

2473
02:18:16.980 --> 02:18:19.330
hey the sun makes you tan where that's hot and that's nice.

2474
02:18:19.331 --> 02:18:20.530
I mean I think everyone thinks about that.

2475
02:18:20.980 --> 02:18:23.090
I'm thinking about like the stuff that where you,
you know,
if you,

2476
02:18:23.110 --> 02:18:26.380
if you're trying to figure out what the universe is,
if it's alive,

2477
02:18:26.381 --> 02:18:28.810
it's doing this or that,
that's all great and stuff like that.

2478
02:18:28.811 --> 02:18:29.920
But you don't really have no answer.

2479
02:18:29.921 --> 02:18:33.850
I don't like fascinate or thinking about that kind of shit because there will

2480
02:18:33.851 --> 02:18:35.290
never probably know that answer.

2481
02:18:35.470 --> 02:18:38.710
I'd rather figure out my fucking life going on with this

2482
02:18:39.050 --> 02:18:41.360
<v 1>son.
You ain't never going to figure out your love.
You better off.</v>

2483
02:18:41.361 --> 02:18:46.160
Just distract yourself with bullshit.
Well,
I mean
listen,

2484
02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:49.370
let it go kid.
I know.

2485
02:18:50.660 --> 02:18:52.460
I know what if's can be fun here and there,

2486
02:18:52.461 --> 02:18:56.840
but by getting obsessed with them is with Dunkin.
Until I starve to death,

2487
02:18:57.260 --> 02:19:02.090
we can what if till the cows come home?
It's fun.
Fucking philosophy.

2488
02:19:04.140 --> 02:19:08.250
So much of Mckenna's work was what if you know so much of his uh,

2489
02:19:08.450 --> 02:19:10.850
possibilities of prognosticating,

2490
02:19:10.851 --> 02:19:13.660
the eventual technological singularity and he's a,

2491
02:19:13.700 --> 02:19:15.170
he was a big proponent of time travel.

2492
02:19:15.171 --> 02:19:17.570
He really felt like time travel was going to be the one thing that fucked

2493
02:19:17.571 --> 02:19:19.670
everything up.
Can I do it?
What if real quick,

2494
02:19:20.150 --> 02:19:23.510
what if Brian worked for the CIA and he was like,

2495
02:19:23.511 --> 02:19:28.070
infiltrate the podcast to try to get us from doing what ifs.
Cause if we he,

2496
02:19:28.070 --> 02:19:31.340
<v 3>they know that if we keep what iffing we're going to come up with something that</v>

2497
02:19:31.341 --> 02:19:34.640
isn't just bullshit.
You're right,
dude,
you might be a fucking fed.

2498
02:19:35.330 --> 02:19:38.760
Speaking of which,
where are you out this weekend?
Oh,
I'm at the Ama Ama,

2499
02:19:38.761 --> 02:19:43.760
the Ann Arbor.
I'm showcasing an arbitrage comedy showcase in Ann Arbor,
Thursday,

2500
02:19:43.761 --> 02:19:45.030
Friday,
and Saturday.
By the way,

2501
02:19:45.050 --> 02:19:47.420
if you never been to comedy showcase in Ann Arbor,
Michigan,

2502
02:19:47.450 --> 02:19:50.840
it is one of the most perfect comedy clubs in the country.

2503
02:19:51.050 --> 02:19:55.580
It's one of those places that you get there and they go,
ah,
these still exist.

2504
02:19:55.700 --> 02:20:00.170
These,
these mom pop owned really well set up,

2505
02:20:00.171 --> 02:20:04.570
well-designed,
small,
intimate space,
great sound system,

2506
02:20:04.590 --> 02:20:07.160
coolest fuck staff.
The whole staff smoke me out.

2507
02:20:07.310 --> 02:20:10.400
We went in the backyard and pass it around to places.
The Shit,

2508
02:20:10.900 --> 02:20:14.050
the cops there were cool as fuck.
Everybody's cool shit.
I can't wait.

2509
02:20:14.440 --> 02:20:19.070
The club is the shit.
I did it with [inaudible] did it.
It was a,

2510
02:20:19.071 --> 02:20:23.990
we had a great,
great,
great fucking time.
Then there's a few of those clubs left,

2511
02:20:23.991 --> 02:20:27.080
you know,
in the country.
That was a half on Denver.
Comedy works.

2512
02:20:27.110 --> 02:20:31.610
Denver comedy set up perfect.
What's that?
Portland,
Oregon is my new faith.

2513
02:20:31.640 --> 02:20:35.210
Portland's helium is the shit that's a new club to love that.

2514
02:20:35.270 --> 02:20:38.280
But Portland has been dying for standup comedy forever and Portland.

2515
02:20:38.281 --> 02:20:41.120
Such a cool community.
So many cool motherfuckers up there.

2516
02:20:41.330 --> 02:20:45.700
Portland's amazing man.
It's a great city.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I love Portland.

2517
02:20:45.701 --> 02:20:47.390
I just don't know if I could deal with the winter time.

2518
02:20:47.690 --> 02:20:49.340
People say just gets fucking crazy.

2519
02:20:49.341 --> 02:20:52.340
I've talked to people that didn't say that years ago.

2520
02:20:52.341 --> 02:20:55.700
I have friends that live in Seattle and years ago I would ask them,
you know,

2521
02:20:55.730 --> 02:20:58.020
does it ever bother you?
The rain now,
you know,
no big deals,

2522
02:20:58.040 --> 02:21:00.980
whatever man and the summertime summertime's they're amazing and just,
you know,

2523
02:21:00.981 --> 02:21:02.600
and just kind of deal with it.
This is what the,
what it is.

2524
02:21:02.720 --> 02:21:04.160
And then you talked to him a couple of years later,
man,

2525
02:21:04.190 --> 02:21:06.830
fuck this fucking weather.
Fuck this is,

2526
02:21:06.831 --> 02:21:10.070
it seems to me to be something you think you could deal with and you can deal

2527
02:21:10.071 --> 02:21:14.660
with it.
It might slowly fuck with you if you don't realize.

2528
02:21:15.060 --> 02:21:16.580
As long as you don't realize there is an alternative.

2529
02:21:16.581 --> 02:21:20.030
Like if you ever lived in southern California and then you moved up to Seattle,

2530
02:21:20.150 --> 02:21:22.190
you might,
after a while I'd be like,
God damn,

2531
02:21:22.191 --> 02:21:24.770
can I get some sun up in this bitch?
Like you fucking,

2532
02:21:24.771 --> 02:21:28.670
people are depressed for a reason,
man.
You're not getting any sun vitamin D.

2533
02:21:29.300 --> 02:21:32.000
Exactly.
But to have a comedy club up there,

2534
02:21:32.090 --> 02:21:35.420
there's so many cool fuckers up there,
man,
Seattle,
Portland,

2535
02:21:35.421 --> 02:21:38.930
that whole northwest bad ass.
It's great.

2536
02:21:38.960 --> 02:21:42.050
It's like always good times.
I've never had a bad show up there.

2537
02:21:42.050 --> 02:21:46.100
They've always been fun.
Portland is fucking that.
That helium comedy club,

2538
02:21:46.230 --> 02:21:51.110
one of the best places we ever worked.
It's amazing.
I've heard great,

2539
02:21:51.111 --> 02:21:53.270
great everything.
Those helium guys and the guys from Philly,

2540
02:21:53.271 --> 02:21:55.470
they just know exactly what they're doing.
They're there,

2541
02:21:55.640 --> 02:21:59.080
they're fucking masters at it.
You know?
It's just like,
you know,

2542
02:21:59.260 --> 02:22:01.010
there's a few of those clubs like Improv.

2543
02:22:01.011 --> 02:22:04.890
It's like we did the Ontario Improv this weekend.
Fuck.
It was awesome.
Yeah.

2544
02:22:04.940 --> 02:22:08.540
That Ontario Improv is one of the most underrated Improv's math because the

2545
02:22:08.541 --> 02:22:13.080
people out there as cool as shit,
it's always packed.
Every show was sold out.

2546
02:22:13.081 --> 02:22:15.060
It was fucking awesome.
Yeah.

2547
02:22:15.061 --> 02:22:18.800
There seems to be a real correlation to how cool comedy clubs are getting and

2548
02:22:18.801 --> 02:22:21.200
how your podcast is becoming popular.

2549
02:22:21.201 --> 02:22:25.140
Because there's a lot of fucking podcast fans that come out to these shows and

2550
02:22:25.141 --> 02:22:25.974
they're fucking

2551
02:22:26.010 --> 02:22:26.843
<v 0>awesome.</v>

2552
02:22:26.850 --> 02:22:31.440
Somebody fucking palm banana bread in a Ziploc bag in my hand in Atlanta.

2553
02:22:31.890 --> 02:22:36.030
That was one of the funniest,
cool,
coolest things because,

2554
02:22:36.650 --> 02:22:41.220
and it was just banana bread.
That's a Brownie somebody gave me.
I'm scared of.

2555
02:22:41.280 --> 02:22:44.530
It's right there.
Forget it.
You just don't know.
I'm scared.

2556
02:22:46.080 --> 02:22:49.020
I'm gonna feed it to my job in the original form.
You can't lie.

2557
02:22:49.110 --> 02:22:52.320
You just never know.
You never know what it could be,
man.

2558
02:22:52.321 --> 02:22:56.400
That could be some Jacob's ladder shit you cause.
So if they want to see you,

2559
02:22:56.610 --> 02:22:58.620
how do they buy tickets for this cause on my website,

2560
02:22:58.621 --> 02:23:01.350

master.
He just has this down to a science.

2587
02:24:29.890 --> 02:24:32.760
That's why he interjects.
He tried to a fuck with your thought waves.

2588
02:24:32.761 --> 02:24:33.780
I fucked up the show today.

2589
02:24:34.140 --> 02:24:37.620
What if he's out the conversation as a time traveler and he knows that we're

2590
02:24:37.621 --> 02:24:39.700
trying to talk about time travel.
I told him to write faggots.
