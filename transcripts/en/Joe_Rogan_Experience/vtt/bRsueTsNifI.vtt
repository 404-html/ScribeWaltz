<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.080
<v Speaker 1>What's it like hanging out with those guys?</v>

3
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:05.183
<v Speaker 1>I listened junk.</v>

4
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.390
<v Speaker 1>When I went in there,</v>

5
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:07.710
<v Speaker 1>I told myself,</v>

6
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.420
<v Speaker 1>I ain't talking to nobody.</v>

7
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:10.793
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

8
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to speak when spoken to,</v>

9
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:15.420
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

10
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.330
<v Speaker 1>there was a part when they were kind of lighting the narrow and I,</v>

11
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.470
<v Speaker 1>and were standing face to face and he's looking at me and I'm looking right at</v>

12
00:00:22.471 --> 00:00:22.950
<v Speaker 1>him and um,</v>

13
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.300
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't gonna say nothing.</v>

14
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:26.420
<v Speaker 1>And then he comes in and my,</v>

15
00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:27.570
<v Speaker 1>my tiny,</v>

16
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.070
<v Speaker 1>tiny needs to be tight and a little bit and he cinched my tie</v>

17
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.660
<v Speaker 1>straight down.</v>

18
00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:38.940
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

19
00:00:38.941 --> 00:00:39.900
<v Speaker 1>I had a wig.</v>

20
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.700
<v Speaker 1>They put me in a wig.</v>

21
00:00:41.701 --> 00:00:42.970
<v Speaker 1>And what kind of wig would it look like?</v>

22
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:44.191
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>

23
00:00:44.191 --> 00:00:45.024
<v Speaker 1>there's there,</v>

24
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.590
<v Speaker 1>if you type up Sebastian Maniscalco Irishman that it should pop up.</v>

25
00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.941
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

26
00:00:50.941 --> 00:00:51.660
<v Speaker 1>there it is.</v>

27
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:52.411
<v Speaker 1>What is the difference?</v>

28
00:00:52.411 --> 00:00:53.244
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

29
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:55.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm so confused.</v>

30
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.670
<v Speaker 1>Why did they give you a wig?</v>

31
00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.920
<v Speaker 1>It's got sideburns.</v>

32
00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:59.221
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

33
00:00:59.221 --> 00:00:59.521
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

34
00:00:59.521 --> 00:01:00.990
<v Speaker 1>if you see it in person,</v>

35
00:01:00.991 --> 00:01:02.640
<v Speaker 1>you'll understand maybe why I have,</v>

36
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:04.180
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

37
00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.510
<v Speaker 1>It's not that much of a departure from,</v>

38
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.230
<v Speaker 1>from my,</v>

39
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.921
<v Speaker 1>my real hair.</v>

40
00:01:07.921 --> 00:01:08.281
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

41
00:01:08.281 --> 00:01:09.114
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

42
00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.680
<v Speaker 1>did they give you the option of growing sideburns and you like it?</v>

43
00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.611
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

44
00:01:12.611 --> 00:01:13.750
<v Speaker 1>they just said again,</v>

45
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:15.430
<v Speaker 1>I didn't say nothing.</v>

46
00:01:15.431 --> 00:01:16.600
<v Speaker 1>They said you're going to wear a wig.</v>

47
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:17.200
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

48
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.770
<v Speaker 1>no problem.</v>

49
00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:18.640
<v Speaker 1>Whatever you want me to do.</v>

50

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:12.410
<v Speaker 2>Gets to my turn</v>

269
00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:15.013
<v Speaker 2>in the nose.</v>

270
00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.440
<v Speaker 2>All of a sudden I feel like I've got acid on my brain,</v>

271
00:06:18.441 --> 00:06:19.640
<v Speaker 2>like chlorine in my head.</v>

272
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:21.290
<v Speaker 2>I break into the sweat,</v>

273
00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:25.070
<v Speaker 2>my eyes explode and I'm like wobbling like this.</v>

274
00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.510
<v Speaker 2>And it 30 seconds later I'm just curled over in the fetal position,</v>

275
00:06:29.511 --> 00:06:32.630
<v Speaker 2>just projectile vomiting cannot hold it together.</v>

276
00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:33.650
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

277
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:34.221
<v Speaker 2>Lorenzo,</v>

00:06:34.821 --> 00:06:37.370
<v Speaker 2>the tribal shaman goes good,</v>

281
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:38.151
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

282
00:06:38.151 --> 00:06:38.601
<v Speaker 2>And we're like,</v>

283
00:06:38.601 --> 00:06:39.411
<v Speaker 2>why is this good?</v>

284
00:06:39.411 --> 00:06:39.771
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

285
00:06:39.771 --> 00:06:41.210
<v Speaker 2>he had a bad spirit in him.</v>

286
00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.530
<v Speaker 2>If he had gone up the river,</v>

287
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:43.640
<v Speaker 2>he would have been killed.</v>

288
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:45.140
<v Speaker 2>He's just got the bad spirit out.</v>

289
00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:46.430
<v Speaker 2>This is why I had to bless you.</v>

290
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:47.630
<v Speaker 2>Now you can go.</v>

291
00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.960
<v Speaker 2>And I was the only one that had hit like that out of our five person crew.</v>

292
00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:51.740
<v Speaker 2>Everybody else was like,</v>

293
00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:51.921
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

295
00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:53.061
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

296
00:06:53.061 --> 00:06:55.100
<v Speaker 2>I was literally fetal position,</v>

297
00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:56.240
<v Speaker 2>feverish,</v>

298
00:06:56.241 --> 00:06:57.350
<v Speaker 2>puking cray.</v>

299
00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:59.900
<v Speaker 2>And I've never done any drugs like hard drugs.</v>

300
00:06:59.901 --> 00:07:01.340
<v Speaker 2>Like it's just not my thing.</v>

301
00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:04.220
<v Speaker 2>And this thing just hit me like a ton of brick.</v>

302
00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:05.051
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

303
00:07:05.051 --> 00:07:06.310
<v Speaker 3>so the Liam Neeson thing,</v>

304
00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:07.601
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

305
00:07:07.601 --> 00:07:08.860
<v Speaker 3>forgive me if I,</v>

306
00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:11.560
<v Speaker 3>if there's some detail that has come out that I'm not aware of,</v>

307
00:07:11.561 --> 00:07:14.530
<v Speaker 3>but my understanding of it is he,</v>

308
00:07:14.531 --> 00:07:14.711
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

309
00:07:14.711 --> 00:07:19.480
<v Speaker 3>he had a friend who was raped and then he reported this state of mind,</v>

310
00:07:19.481 --> 00:07:24.250
<v Speaker 3>this murderous state of mind he was in where he was walking around with,</v>

311
00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:26.960
<v Speaker 3>I think he calls it a a,</v>

312
00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.270
<v Speaker 3>that's a British word for like,</v>

313
00:07:28.271 --> 00:07:28.510
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

314
00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:28.931
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

315
00:07:28.931 --> 00:07:29.100
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

316
00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:30.340
<v Speaker 3>a small metal club.</v>

317
00:07:30.341 --> 00:07:31.174
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

318
00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:32.133
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

319
00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:35.020
<v Speaker 3>there's like a black jack or like another term for it,</v>

320
00:07:35.021 --> 00:07:35.680
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

321
00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:40.680
<v Speaker 3>And I'm looking for a black eye to kill a,</v>

322
00:07:41.251 --> 00:07:41.411
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

323
00:07:41.411 --> 00:07:41.561
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

324
00:07:41.561 --> 00:07:44.410
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't hoping someone's going to come out of the woodwork and threatened him</v>

325
00:07:44.411 --> 00:07:49.411
<v Speaker 3>so that he could kill this guy in this act of instrumental violence because his</v>

326
00:07:49.631 --> 00:07:51.100
<v Speaker 3>friend had been raped by a black guy.</v>

327
00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:51.300
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

328
00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:52.630
<v Speaker 3>Just like any black guy will do.</v>

329
00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:52.781
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

330
00:07:52.781 --> 00:07:53.051
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

331
00:07:53.051 --> 00:07:53.950
<v Speaker 3>that's sort of like the,</v>

332
00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:58.570
<v Speaker 3>the extra horrific wrinkle to the story right now.</v>

333
00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:04.260
<v Speaker 3>And he's confessing this as a kind of a symptom of transient mental illness,</v>

334
00:08:04.661 --> 00:08:05.750
<v Speaker 3>at least as far as I know.</v>

335
00:08:05.751 --> 00:08:06.001
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

336
00:08:06.001 --> 00:08:06.081
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

337
00:08:06.081 --> 00:08:09.010
<v Speaker 3>he's horrified by the fact that he was in the state of mind.</v>

338
00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:09.161
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

339
00:08:09.161 --> 00:08:11.050
<v Speaker 3>Can you imagine like the Liam Neeson,</v>

340
00:08:11.051 --> 00:08:11.884
<v Speaker 3>that an actor?</v>

341
00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:12.870
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

342
00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:16.010
<v Speaker 3>I have everything to lose and although I don't remember why,</v>

343
00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:17.950
<v Speaker 3>at what point in his life he said this happened.</v>

344
00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:18.850
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

345
00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:20.290
<v Speaker 3>can you imagine that?</v>

346
00:08:20.291 --> 00:08:21.580
<v Speaker 3>I was in the state of mind.</v>

347
00:08:21.581 --> 00:08:22.270
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

348
00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:23.350
<v Speaker 3>And this is,</v>

349
00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:24.520
<v Speaker 3>as you say,</v>

350
00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:26.500
<v Speaker 3>an all too honest disclosure,</v>

351
00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:30.160
<v Speaker 3>but it is damn interesting.</v>

352
00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:30.730
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

353
00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:35.080
<v Speaker 3>And it is the kind of thing that we should be able to talk about.</v>

354
00:08:35.290 --> 00:08:35.561
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

355
00:08:35.561 --> 00:08:36.430
<v Speaker 3>And it's not,</v>

356
00:08:36.431 --> 00:08:41.431
<v Speaker 3>and the fact that this is becoming synonymous with racism seems just wrong</v>

357
00:08:41.831 --> 00:08:42.430
<v Speaker 3>given,</v>

358
00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:43.360
<v Speaker 3>given how he's,</v>

359
00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:44.201
<v Speaker 3>he described,</v>

360
00:08:44.201 --> 00:08:45.100
<v Speaker 3>or at least how I've,</v>

361
00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.930
<v Speaker 3>I've heard this because he's saying,</v>

362
00:08:46.931 --> 00:08:47.231
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

363
00:08:47.231 --> 00:08:52.060
<v Speaker 3>if this had been an Armenian guy or an Italian or a Japanese guy,</v>

364
00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:53.470
<v Speaker 3>I'd be looking for one of them.</v>

365
00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:53.711
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

366
00:08:53.711 --> 00:08:53.950
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

367
00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:54.141
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

368
00:08:54.141 --> 00:08:54.550
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

369
00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:55.383
<v Speaker 3>what this,</v>

370
00:08:55.950 --> 00:09:00.840
<v Speaker 3>at least on his talent is the virus of instrumental violence.</v>

371
00:09:00.841 --> 00:09:00.991
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

372
00:09:00.991 --> 00:09:03.780
<v Speaker 3>the vi the virus of like,</v>

373
00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:07.960
<v Speaker 3>this is how every blood feud ever in human history gets started.</v>

374
00:09:07.961 --> 00:09:08.794
<v Speaker 3>It's like you,</v>

375
00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:11.700
<v Speaker 3>like someone from your tribe killed my brother.</v>

376
00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:15.600
<v Speaker 3>And now what I want to do is kill anyone from your tribe.</v>

377
00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:15.841
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

378
00:09:15.841 --> 00:09:16.674
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't matter who.</v>

379
00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:17.310
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

380
00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:17.761
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

381
00:09:17.761 --> 00:09:18.870
<v Speaker 3>and that's,</v>

382
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:19.801
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

383
00:09:19.801 --> 00:09:22.620
<v Speaker 3>clearly as toxic as it gets,</v>

384
00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:23.011
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

385
00:09:23.011 --> 00:09:23.844
<v Speaker 3>ethically.</v>

386
00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:26.160
<v Speaker 3>But that's not racism.</v>

387
00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:26.551
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

388
00:09:26.551 --> 00:09:27.384
<v Speaker 3>That's just,</v>

389
00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:29.640
<v Speaker 3>that is that we have a word for it.</v>

390
00:09:29.641 --> 00:09:29.980
<v Speaker 3>It's in,</v>

391
00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:31.260
<v Speaker 3>it's instrumental violence.</v>

392
00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:32.610
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

393
00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:33.390
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

394
00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:33.661
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

395
00:09:33.661 --> 00:09:36.060
<v Speaker 3>Obviously he's getting totally pilloried over this.</v>

396
00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:36.810
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

397
00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:37.680
<v Speaker 3>but we need,</v>

398
00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:44.270
<v Speaker 3>we just need to figure out how to talk about how people can redeem themselves</v>

399
00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:48.040
<v Speaker 3>once something this unsavory is,</v>

400
00:09:48.041 --> 00:09:49.890
<v Speaker 3>is revealed about their past,</v>

401
00:09:49.891 --> 00:09:51.360
<v Speaker 3>whether they reveal it or whether it's just,</v>

402
00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:51.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

403
00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:52.690
<v Speaker 3>found out about [inaudible].</v>

404
00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:55.600
<v Speaker 4>What people don't seem to realize when it comes to history is that when you read</v>

405
00:09:55.601 --> 00:09:56.590
<v Speaker 4>about World War II,</v>

406
00:09:56.710 --> 00:10:00.010
<v Speaker 4>we've condensed all the highlights into a very short paragraph or a series of</v>

407
00:10:00.011 --> 00:10:00.471
<v Speaker 4>paragraphs.</v>

408
00:10:00.471 --> 00:10:02.350
<v Speaker 4>And you don't realize the war was several years.</v>

409
00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:04.090
<v Speaker 4>There were periods where nothing happened,</v>

410
00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:05.050
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

411
00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:07.480
<v Speaker 4>I was in Egypt during the second revolution.</v>

412
00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:11.290
<v Speaker 4>You could look down and you could see Tahrir Square people screaming,</v>

413
00:10:11.291 --> 00:10:11.831
<v Speaker 4>laser pointers,</v>

414
00:10:11.831 --> 00:10:12.401
<v Speaker 4>helicopters,</v>

415
00:10:12.401 --> 00:10:13.234
<v Speaker 4>Apaches.</v>

416
00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:14.440
<v Speaker 4>And they announced in the news,</v>

417
00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:15.040
<v Speaker 4>we've just,</v>

418
00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:16.870
<v Speaker 4>we've deposed the president two blocks away.</v>

419
00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:19.930
<v Speaker 4>A dude's eating a cheeseburger at Mcdonald's watching a football match as if</v>

420
00:10:19.931 --> 00:10:20.764
<v Speaker 4>nothing's happening.</v>

421
00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:22.690
<v Speaker 4>So when you look at the street battles,</v>

422
00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:23.620
<v Speaker 4>the political violence,</v>

423
00:10:23.621 --> 00:10:24.680
<v Speaker 4>when you look at the,</v>

424
00:10:24.681 --> 00:10:24.891
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

425
00:10:24.891 --> 00:10:27.220
<v Speaker 4>the bias Banning's you look at the dude,</v>

426
00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:31.090
<v Speaker 4>there was a guy who fired a couple of rounds at a police officer and Eugene,</v>

427
00:10:31.091 --> 00:10:34.690
<v Speaker 4>Oregon and some bombs got planted at the police department or somebody planted</v>

428
00:10:34.691 --> 00:10:36.070
<v Speaker 4>bombs that a statue in Houston.</v>

429
00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:40.060
<v Speaker 4>It starts to feel like there's some kind of political violence that is bubbling</v>

430
00:10:40.061 --> 00:10:41.620
<v Speaker 4>up that can't be mended at this point.</v>

431
00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:45.430
<v Speaker 4>And a lot of this comes from the suppression that we're talking about where</v>

432
00:10:45.431 --> 00:10:49.150
<v Speaker 4>people don't feel like they have a voice or that voice is being suppressed by an</v>

433
00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:50.380
<v Speaker 4>opposing ideologies,</v>

434
00:10:50.381 --> 00:10:51.190
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

435
00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:52.000
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

436
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.380
<v Speaker 4>But it is really complicated and it's,</v>

437
00:10:53.381 --> 00:10:53.840
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

438
00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:54.040
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

439
00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:56.380
<v Speaker 4>I can't claim to know how everything happens,</v>

440
00:10:56.381 --> 00:11:01.030
<v Speaker 4>but what I will say is I believe social media is responsible for the political</v>

441
00:11:01.031 --> 00:11:01.570
<v Speaker 4>violence.</v>

442
00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:02.260
<v Speaker 4>I believe it's,</v>

443
00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:02.530
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

444
00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:03.700
<v Speaker 4>it's not just about suppression.</v>

445
00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:05.580
<v Speaker 4>It's you,</v>

446
00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:06.281
<v Speaker 4>you look at,</v>

447
00:11:06.281 --> 00:11:06.820
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

448
00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:08.200
<v Speaker 4>the systems that were built Facebook,</v>

449
00:11:08.201 --> 00:11:08.800
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

450
00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:11.620
<v Speaker 4>What content can make it to the front page of your Facebook posts,</v>

451
00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:12.910
<v Speaker 4>of your Facebook profile.</v>

452
00:11:12.911 --> 00:11:14.290
<v Speaker 4>When you're looking at your newsfeed while Twitter,</v>

453
00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:17.110
<v Speaker 4>Facebook has to build an algorithm to determine what matters.</v>

454
00:11:17.111 --> 00:11:20.890
<v Speaker 4>Most companies then figure out how to manipulate that algorithm to get that</v>

455
00:11:20.891 --> 00:11:21.790
<v Speaker 4>content in front of you.</v>

456
00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:22.571
<v Speaker 4>Because you know,</v>

457
00:11:22.571 --> 00:11:24.520
<v Speaker 4>at most even see what three posts on Facebook.</v>

458
00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:26.350
<v Speaker 4>So what happens is early on,</v>

459
00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:31.510
<v Speaker 4>companies quickly found out that anger drives the most shares of any emotion.</v>

460
00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:34.120
<v Speaker 4>All of a sudden we see a wave of police brutality videos.</v>

461
00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:38.290
<v Speaker 4>There was one website that posted almost exclusively police brutality content,</v>

462
00:11:38.291 --> 00:11:39.160
<v Speaker 4>and it was like Alexa,</v>

463
00:11:39.161 --> 00:11:40.630
<v Speaker 4>400 in the world,</v>

464
00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:42.520
<v Speaker 4>some ridiculously high number of blew my mind.</v>

465
00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:43.270
<v Speaker 4>I knew Pete,</v>

466
00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:43.600
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

467
00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.880
<v Speaker 4>someone claims to that they're making six figures,</v>

468
00:11:45.881 --> 00:11:49.630
<v Speaker 4>writing police brutality articles because it was pure rage bait,</v>

469
00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:50.380
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

470
00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:52.000
<v Speaker 4>Content that just shares really easily,</v>

471
00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:56.380
<v Speaker 4>but that constantly being put in front of somebody breeds an ideology.</v>

472
00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:57.730
<v Speaker 4>You then tell someone,</v>

473
00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.380
<v Speaker 4>did you know that?</v>

474
00:11:59.381 --> 00:11:59.621
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

475
00:11:59.621 --> 00:12:03.160
<v Speaker 4>white supremacy is on the rise and there are 11 million white supremacists in</v>

476
00:12:03.161 --> 00:12:04.270
<v Speaker 4>the U S and they go,</v>

477
00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:05.133
<v Speaker 4>I can believe it.</v>

478
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:06.161
<v Speaker 4>But that's nonsense.</v>

479
00:12:06.161 --> 00:12:06.720
<v Speaker 4>It's just not,</v>

480
00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:07.570
<v Speaker 4>there's not the case.</v>

481
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:08.141
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

482
00:12:08.141 --> 00:12:11.260
<v Speaker 4>the Anti Defamation League and the SPLC say that we're at rough estimates,</v>

483
00:12:11.261 --> 00:12:12.520
<v Speaker 4>or maybe like 10 or 12,000,</v>

484
00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:15.220
<v Speaker 4>but people really believe that there is,</v>

485
00:12:15.221 --> 00:12:19.540
<v Speaker 4>like at the president does secretly a Nazi and that he's being propped up by the</v>

486
00:12:19.541 --> 00:12:20.291
<v Speaker 4>secret cabal,</v>

487
00:12:20.291 --> 00:12:23.710
<v Speaker 4>or there's an alternative influence network on Youtube where you and me or</v>

488
00:12:23.711 --> 00:12:25.900
<v Speaker 4>somehow trying to convince people to,</v>

489
00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:26.111
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

490
00:12:26.111 --> 00:12:26.944
<v Speaker 4>this is ridiculous.</v>

491
00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:27.640
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
