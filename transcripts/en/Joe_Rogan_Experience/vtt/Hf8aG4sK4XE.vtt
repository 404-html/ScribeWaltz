00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:03.090

2
00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:06.410
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>

3
00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:07.910

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.020
<v Speaker 2>Really stoked to be here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's cool to have you.</v>

6
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.930
<v Speaker 2>Hey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I wanted to talk about what we were</v>

7
00:00:13.931 --> 00:00:16.660
<v Speaker 2>talking about right before we started.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always watched you play drums and</v>

8
00:00:16.661 --> 00:00:18.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how the fuck does that guy's arms not</v>

9
00:00:18.891 --> 00:00:20.600
<v Speaker 2>fall off?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

10
00:00:20.601 --> 00:00:23.720
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have so much repetitive motion.</v>

11
00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.150
<v Speaker 2>I've never understood how you could do</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

12
00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.110
<v Speaker 2>Just barely know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

13
00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.190
<v Speaker 2>I pull this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pull this thing like write up like a</v>

14
00:00:31.191 --> 00:00:32.480
<v Speaker 2>fist from your face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There we go.</v>

15
00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.940
<v Speaker 2>I always do battle ropes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

16
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:35.721
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That happened.</v>

17
00:00:35.721 --> 00:00:38.000
<v Speaker 2>That must constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll do 30 minutes.</v>

18
00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm not high intensity the whole time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just keep my shoulders and arms</v>

19
00:00:42.561 --> 00:00:46.400
<v Speaker 2>moving as I prepare for a tour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

20
00:00:46.401 --> 00:00:49.190
<v Speaker 2>I think my risk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my risk probably have gone through the</v>

21
00:00:49.191 --> 00:00:51.290
<v Speaker 2>most hell over the years.</v>

22
00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.290
<v Speaker 2>Like I just feel like just normal</v>
<v Speaker 2>people's risk strength that probably</v>

23
00:00:54.291 --> 00:00:56.540
<v Speaker 2>don't have because there's been so much</v>
<v Speaker 2>grinding,</v>

24
00:00:56.541 --> 00:01:00.050
<v Speaker 2>like they pop and oh Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you all sorts of weird things.</v>

25
00:01:00.051 --> 00:01:01.850
<v Speaker 2>But yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm still,</v>

26
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like because I do battle ropes</v>

27
00:01:03.981 --> 00:01:07.340
<v Speaker 2>and because I box and the kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>workout fast twitch muscles,</v>

28
00:01:07.341 --> 00:01:09.100
<v Speaker 2>I really don't get tired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

29
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.490
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing because so many people have</v>
<v Speaker 2>repetitive stress injuries.</v>

30
00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.070
<v Speaker 2>I mean even secretaries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get carpal tunnel,</v>

31
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people get who write a lot,</v>

32
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.700
<v Speaker 2>get carpal tunnel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kids are getting injuries on their</v>

33
00:01:19.701 --> 00:01:22.220
<v Speaker 2>thumbs from fucking around with their</v>
<v Speaker 2>phone too much.</v>

34
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt like when I smoked cigarettes a</v>

35
00:01:24.141 --> 00:01:27.800
<v Speaker 2>lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was feeling kind of the first symptoms</v>

36
00:01:27.801 --> 00:01:30.290
<v Speaker 2>of that stuff and I wasn't drinking a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot.</v>

37
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.930
<v Speaker 2>I was kind of a dumpster on tour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

38
00:01:32.931 --> 00:01:35.750
<v Speaker 2>not really taking care of my body and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>could really feel it.</v>

39
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.720
<v Speaker 2>And then why are you still Vegan?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

40
00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.760
<v Speaker 2>And you run that restaurant was</v>
<v Speaker 2>crossroads or it's one of your.</v>

41
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.200
<v Speaker 2>One of the owners running it is saying a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot.</v>

42
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.590
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't have said running.</v>

43
00:01:48.591 --> 00:01:51.200
<v Speaker 2>No towel towel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ronan is the man.</v>

44
00:01:51.201 --> 00:01:55.330
<v Speaker 2>He's like the Las Vegan chef ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's like an old punk rock hardcore</v>

45
00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.170
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like knew John Joseph.</v>

46
00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.560
<v Speaker 2>John Joseph keeps trying to get me to go</v>
<v Speaker 2>there and I almost went last time he was</v>

47
00:02:00.561 --> 00:02:02.270
<v Speaker 2>in town with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Next time I'm going to make it down</v>

48
00:02:02.271 --> 00:02:05.270
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think probably 80,</v>

49
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.410
<v Speaker 2>90 percent of the people that eat there</v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't vegan because it's that good.</v>

50
00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:10.401
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I hear.</v>

51
00:02:10.401 --> 00:02:11.660
<v Speaker 2>Dana White said that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

52
00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:12.291
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

53
00:02:12.291 --> 00:02:14.270
<v Speaker 2>Dana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We usually have dinner there when he's</v>

54
00:02:14.271 --> 00:02:16.940
<v Speaker 2>in town,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I think for Dana to be able to sit</v>

55
00:02:16.941 --> 00:02:21.650
<v Speaker 2>through it and enjoy it and Matt Serra,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he brought everyone for like,</v>

56
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it was like fight</v>
<v Speaker 2>companion.</v>

57
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.880
<v Speaker 2>It was like one of those was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

58
00:02:24.881 --> 00:02:26.890
<v Speaker 2>it was Dana White's looking for a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

59
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.150
<v Speaker 2>Youtube show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

60
00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.350
<v Speaker 2>I was on tour but they facetime me from</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

61
00:02:30.351 --> 00:02:33.050
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>towel is a like a GE.</v>

62
00:02:33.051 --> 00:02:35.270
<v Speaker 2>He's the best Vegan chef in the world by</v>
<v Speaker 2>far.</v>

63
00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.400
<v Speaker 2>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did you get involved with that?</v>

64
00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.170
<v Speaker 2>Is it what you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were you already,</v>

65
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.680
<v Speaker 2>you're cleaning your diet up because of</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

66
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.090
<v Speaker 2>your injuries or because you were trying</v>
<v Speaker 2>to keep your body tuned for drumming or</v>

67
00:02:47.241 --> 00:02:48.740
<v Speaker 2>you just wanted to clean it up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Period.</v>

68
00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.840
<v Speaker 2>Now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was vegetarian since I was 13.</v>

69
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:51.740
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

70
00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.030
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

71
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.940
<v Speaker 2>after my accident I was in the hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually long story,</v>

72
00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 2>I'll just sum</v>

73
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.300
<v Speaker 3>up into real plain piece.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

74
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.700
<v Speaker 3>And I had to eat meat in the hospital</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they didn't have any other kind</v>

75
00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:08.740
<v Speaker 3>of Vegan options,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a protein,</v>

76
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.560
<v Speaker 3>Saudi bags of beef Jerky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

77
00:03:11.561 --> 00:03:14.590
<v Speaker 3>They would give me whatever I could</v>
<v Speaker 3>stomach and not like kind of like think</v>

78
00:03:14.591 --> 00:03:19.591
<v Speaker 3>about what I was eating because I wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>eating at all and I was just ditching my</v>

79
00:03:19.601 --> 00:03:21.220
<v Speaker 3>food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>given it to my friends because I didn't</v>

80
00:03:21.221 --> 00:03:23.890
<v Speaker 3>want to eat any of it and I got caught</v>
<v Speaker 3>so long story short,</v>

81
00:03:23.891 --> 00:03:28.891
<v Speaker 3>a little bit of meat and in the hospital</v>
<v Speaker 3>and when I got out I just felt like the</v>

82
00:03:28.931 --> 00:03:33.580
<v Speaker 3>next evolution of my eating would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would try and be Vegan and it was so</v>

83
00:03:33.581 --> 00:03:36.130
<v Speaker 3>easy in la because we have so many great</v>
<v Speaker 3>vegan restaurants.</v>

84
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:37.383
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was,</v>

85
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.490
<v Speaker 3>that was pretty much it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was already Vegan.</v>

86
00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.440
<v Speaker 3>I was actually at a bad brain show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the best hardcore bands in the</v>

87
00:03:44.441 --> 00:03:45.970
<v Speaker 3>world to ever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever do it.</v>

88
00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.700
<v Speaker 3>And tell approached me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're saying,</v>

89
00:03:48.701 --> 00:03:50.280
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had this idea for a restaurant I'd</v>

90
00:03:50.281 --> 00:03:51.090
<v Speaker 3>really like to beat you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

91
00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.170
<v Speaker 3>you to be involved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

92
00:03:53.171 --> 00:03:55.120
<v Speaker 3>say no more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just tell me what you need.</v>

93
00:03:55.121 --> 00:03:59.980
<v Speaker 3>Because I do think before of a weird</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing to approach someone with a man</v>

94
00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.980
<v Speaker 3>thinking about open up a restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

95
00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:03.670
<v Speaker 3>I need this drummer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

96
00:04:03.671 --> 00:04:04.421
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

97
00:04:04.421 --> 00:04:07.840
<v Speaker 3>I think he was just reaching out to</v>
<v Speaker 3>friends and family because he was,</v>

98
00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.490
<v Speaker 3>he was oprah's chef and he was ellen</v>
<v Speaker 3>degeneres chef and he was all these</v>

99
00:04:12.491 --> 00:04:13.750
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

100
00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.900
<v Speaker 3>really high profile people is Vegan chef</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they would,</v>

101
00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do a Vegan diet for however long.</v>

102
00:04:19.811 --> 00:04:20.950
<v Speaker 3>Some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some forever,</v>

103
00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:23.830
<v Speaker 3>some just like a two week thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

104
00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.920
<v Speaker 3>I think he just got to the point where</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wants to do something for himself.</v>

105
00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:32.050
<v Speaker 3>And then crossroads was born and I knew</v>
<v Speaker 3>how good he was.</v>

106
00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.270
<v Speaker 3>So I just told him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say no more,</v>

107
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.010
<v Speaker 3>tell me what you need from me and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

108
00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:37.840
<v Speaker 3>And then it just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

109
00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.350
<v Speaker 3>I think it's been five years now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it's got a fantastic reputation.</v>

110
00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.410
<v Speaker 3>I know a bunch of people that have eaten</v>
<v Speaker 3>there and they love it.</v>

111
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.680
<v Speaker 3>Well it's not because of me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's because of talent is food for sure.</v>

112
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:48.551
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Talents.</v>

<v Speaker 3>promoting it?</v>

<v Speaker 3>construction of it or nothing with like</v>

118
00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.210
<v Speaker 3>the decor or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would run stuff by us like hey check</v>

119
00:05:04.211 --> 00:05:05.950
<v Speaker 3>this out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tell us what you guys think of this.</v>

120
00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:10.390
<v Speaker 3>As you know there's basically menus</v>
<v Speaker 3>change every season so it's not the same</v>

121
00:05:10.391 --> 00:05:11.590
<v Speaker 3>menu all year long.</v>

122
00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.040
<v Speaker 3>So as we prepare for the next season's</v>
<v Speaker 3>menu,</v>

123
00:05:15.041 --> 00:05:17.590
<v Speaker 3>he's like testing it on us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

124
00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:18.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the season prior.</v>

125
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.600
<v Speaker 3>So he'll be bringing out dishes and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and letting us try it.</v>

126
00:05:22.601 --> 00:05:24.340
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he curates the whole thing.</v>

127
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:26.800
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when he gets his food,</v>

128
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.800
<v Speaker 3>when he's preparing his food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is he getting his stuff directly from</v>

129
00:05:29.801 --> 00:05:30.850
<v Speaker 3>farmers?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how,</v>

130
00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.550
<v Speaker 3>how is he getting his food?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

131
00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.420
<v Speaker 3>directly from farms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

132
00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:38.450
<v Speaker 3>So he has to curate these relationships</v>
<v Speaker 3>with these farmers and just like go</v>

133
00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.110
<v Speaker 3>visit them and find out how they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>growing their food.</v>

134
00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:42.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

135
00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.580
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll be all set with a menu if it's</v>

136
00:05:45.581 --> 00:05:47.770
<v Speaker 3>fall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then those same vegetables aren't in</v>

137
00:05:47.771 --> 00:05:52.180
<v Speaker 3>season so he has to rethink everything</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the next season and not kinda repeat</v>

138
00:05:52.181 --> 00:05:54.310
<v Speaker 3>himself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he really,</v>

139
00:05:54.311 --> 00:05:57.530
<v Speaker 3>he's really got it down to a science.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And how long has he been Vegan for?</v>

140
00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:59.480
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how long.</v>

141
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.710
<v Speaker 3>Tasmin Vegan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never really asked because it's got</v>

142
00:06:02.711 --> 00:06:05.030
<v Speaker 3>to be incredibly difficult to be a Vegan</v>
<v Speaker 3>chef.</v>

143
00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:07.040
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine being a regular chef was</v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult.</v>

144
00:06:07.041 --> 00:06:09.490
<v Speaker 3>But when you put all those restrictions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

145
00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.520
<v Speaker 3>and just have to make things taste</v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting and different and yeah,</v>

146
00:06:15.081 --> 00:06:18.650
<v Speaker 3>I think that's where chef Scott comes in</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he's actually comes from a meat</v>

147
00:06:18.651 --> 00:06:21.830
<v Speaker 3>background.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he was working at Italian restaurants</v>

148
00:06:21.831 --> 00:06:24.410
<v Speaker 3>in Italian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mediterranean restaurants that cooked</v>

149
00:06:24.411 --> 00:06:28.580
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was infusing this Vegan obviously</v>

150
00:06:28.581 --> 00:06:31.730
<v Speaker 3>like lifestyle of eating with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

151
00:06:31.731 --> 00:06:35.810
<v Speaker 3>chef Scott's tastes as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I think he had to think that out to</v>

152
00:06:35.811 --> 00:06:39.410
<v Speaker 3>where it would appeal in and mediators</v>
<v Speaker 3>would eat there too and not really</v>

153
00:06:39.411 --> 00:06:41.660
<v Speaker 3>notice a difference because I agree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

154
00:06:41.661 --> 00:06:45.810
<v Speaker 3>sometimes I'll be on tour and you go to</v>
<v Speaker 3>a Vegan spot and I'll take my bus driver</v>

155
00:06:45.811 --> 00:06:47.780
<v Speaker 3>ran or my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoever's traveling at me and they're</v>

156
00:06:47.781 --> 00:06:48.561
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh man,</v>

157
00:06:48.561 --> 00:06:49.370
<v Speaker 3>this is rough.</v>

158
00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:51.170
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they can't stand it.</v>

159
00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:54.320
<v Speaker 3>Crossroads is not one of those spots</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you're thinking about like,</v>

160
00:06:54.321 --> 00:06:56.150
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might not enjoy this meal.</v>

161

192
00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:19.590
<v Speaker 3>Let's try to not talk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I could do it.</v>

193
00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.850
<v Speaker 3>Intermittent fasting is like as much as</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can do.</v>

194
00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:24.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do that every night,</v>

195
00:08:24.651 --> 00:08:28.910
<v Speaker 3>but that's the vowel sciences frequently</v>
<v Speaker 3>that silence is freaking me out.</v>

196
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He and I,</v>

197
00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:33.500
<v Speaker 3>I've never really pried and kind of like</v>
<v Speaker 3>asked a bunch of questions.</v>

198
00:08:33.501 --> 00:08:35.090
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because they even have to write a lot.</v>

199
00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:36.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that too,</v>

200
00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:38.690
<v Speaker 3>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been around when people ask him,</v>

201
00:08:38.691 --> 00:08:42.030
<v Speaker 3>he just said he wanted a time out for 22</v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

202
00:08:42.031 --> 00:08:43.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a serious fucking time.</v>

203
00:08:43.551 --> 00:08:47.630
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how old his homeboy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got to be probably in his fifties,</v>

204
00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:49.370
<v Speaker 3>so almost half his life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>what the fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he spends Christmas with me,</v>

206

209
00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:59.490

<v Speaker 2>Basically.</v>

210
00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:02.640
<v Speaker 2>He'd be a good guy to sit next to</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who's on coke.</v>

211
00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:04.790
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would just talk his ear off.</v>

212
00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:07.160
<v Speaker 2>He just be sitting there all silent</v>
<v Speaker 2>night,</v>

213
00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:08.040
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

216
00:09:12.571 --> 00:09:14.890
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does he make any noises?</v>

217
00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:16.830
<v Speaker 2>You Whistle?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

218
00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:20.010

<v Speaker 2>was laughing so hard,</v>

219
00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:23.670
<v Speaker 2>but that was about as close as it gets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he doesn't laugh out loud like,</v>

220
00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:24.830
<v Speaker 2>ha ha,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ha ha,</v>

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:34.800
<v Speaker 2>He has a march to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's called March of silence.</v>

225
00:09:34.801 --> 00:09:38.730
<v Speaker 2>That happens once a year where you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of them that basically,</v>

226
00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:41.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are basically marching for the</v>

227
00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:45.090
<v Speaker 2>march of silence for like the cruelty of</v>
<v Speaker 2>animals and whatever else.</v>

228
00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:48.780

<v Speaker 2>see how long you talked to them for.</v>

00:09:59.941 --> 00:10:02.100
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when you said that I got excited</v>

235
00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:04.140
<v Speaker 2>and the guy has been salvatore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

236
00:10:04.141 --> 00:10:05.100
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

237
00:10:05.101 --> 00:10:07.410

<v Speaker 2>It makes you go wow.</v>

238
00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:11.490
<v Speaker 2>I was talking Hella loud when I first</v>
<v Speaker 2>met him and he was like,</v>

239
00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:13.230
<v Speaker 2>I can hear you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

240
00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:16.380
<v Speaker 2>because it was trying to wrap my head</v>
<v Speaker 2>around,</v>

241
00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:19.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one did an introduction going,</v>

242
00:10:19.261 --> 00:10:20.200
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy's silent.</v>

243
00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:21.700
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't tell you?</v>

244
00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:24.090
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea.</v>

245
00:10:24.091 --> 00:10:29.091
<v Speaker 2>So I'm talking really loud and he like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he like just whispers to me like mouse</v>

246
00:10:29.281 --> 00:10:30.180
<v Speaker 2>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can hear you.</v>

247
00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:31.260
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

248
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:33.660
<v Speaker 2>Then I just figured out over time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

249
00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:36.180
<v Speaker 2>Silent by choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who?</v>

250
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:37.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's heavy.</v>

251
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.950
<v Speaker 2>What is he involved?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like heavy meditation or Buddhism or</v>

252
00:10:40.951 --> 00:10:42.700
<v Speaker 2>anything very strange like that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

253
00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:46.200
<v Speaker 2>he meditates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he has like a lot of kind of</v>

254
00:10:46.201 --> 00:10:49.740
<v Speaker 2>Buddhist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a kind of qualities like kind of.</v>

255
00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.810
<v Speaker 2>I think he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he had to lean in some kind of</v>

256
00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:54.120
<v Speaker 2>religion or practice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be that.</v>

257
00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:55.900
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

258
00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:58.950
<v Speaker 2>that's intense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a serious commitment,</v>

259
00:10:58.951 --> 00:11:01.950
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't even imagine going 22 days</v>

260
00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:04.590
<v Speaker 2>without talking a day I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any,</v>

261
00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:05.460
<v Speaker 2>any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything?</v>

262
00:11:05.461 --> 00:11:08.340
<v Speaker 2>I think we'd catch ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It being very hard.</v>

263
00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:13.860
<v Speaker 2>I was going to get my tonsils and</v>
<v Speaker 2>adenoids removed because I have sleep</v>

264
00:11:13.861 --> 00:11:16.140
<v Speaker 2>apnea because I have a fat neck.</v>

265
00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.540
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found a mouthpiece that I couldn't</v>

266
00:11:18.541 --> 00:11:21.690
<v Speaker 2>sleep with that keeps my tongue from</v>
<v Speaker 2>falling over because I have a.</v>

267
00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:27.390
<v Speaker 2>When when your neck is thick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your wind hole is smaller believer,</v>

268
00:11:27.391 --> 00:11:31.140
<v Speaker 2>not because the more muscle you put it</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the small year your whole gets.</v>

269
00:11:31.141 --> 00:11:33.540
<v Speaker 2>And then if you have a big tongue when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you lay back,</v>

270
00:11:33.541 --> 00:11:35.880
<v Speaker 2>you can actually block your airway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

271
00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:38.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so friends that I know have had</v>

272
00:11:38.581 --> 00:11:40.620
<v Speaker 2>their adenoids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their tonsils removed,</v>

273
00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:43.750
<v Speaker 2>and they actually take some of the soft</v>
<v Speaker 2>tissue out of your,</v>

274
00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:45.780
<v Speaker 2>your passageway so you can breathe</v>
<v Speaker 2>easier.</v>

275
00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:49.740
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is you can't talk for</v>
<v Speaker 2>like seven days.</v>

276
00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.360
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would probably be real for.</v>

277
00:11:51.361 --> 00:11:54.040
<v Speaker 2>You may wonder if wide neck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

278
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:54.873
<v Speaker 3>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

279
00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:57.280
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Internet phenomenon has the same</v>

280
00:11:57.281 --> 00:11:59.140
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get like I must sleep terrible.</v>

281
00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His neck starts up here.</v>

282
00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:03.460
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As next starts at the top of his ears</v>

283
00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:06.180
<v Speaker 3>and works its way to his shoulders.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tonsils out is a,</v>

284
00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:08.080
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a bum out.</v>

285
00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:09.220
<v Speaker 3>I did that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you,</v>

286
00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:14.620
<v Speaker 3>did you have taught politeness or</v>
<v Speaker 3>now you knew what I had is I had,</v>

287
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:18.190
<v Speaker 3>I was smoking tons of weed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

288
00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:21.580
<v Speaker 3>But I would smoke backwards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I love the woods.</v>

289
00:12:21.581 --> 00:12:23.520
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything is right here.</v>

290
00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:25.180
<v Speaker 3>I got them right here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

291
00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:28.600
<v Speaker 3>So I'd smoke about 20,</v>
<v Speaker 3>20 backwards a day.</v>

292
00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:33.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was recording an album with the</v>

293
00:12:33.221 --> 00:12:35.950
<v Speaker 3>transplants and I turned to skinhead rob</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was like,</v>

294
00:12:35.951 --> 00:12:37.830
<v Speaker 3>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I think I have something like</v>

295
00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:40.780
<v Speaker 3>something's lodged in my throat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I could barely breathe right now.</v>

296
00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:44.320
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kept smoking,</v>

297
00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:45.190
<v Speaker 3>didn't even,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

298
00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:47.020
<v Speaker 3>didn't I didn't really know what was</v>
<v Speaker 3>going on.</v>

299
00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:50.560
<v Speaker 3>And then I went to the hospital that</v>
<v Speaker 3>night and they rushed me to another</v>

300
00:12:50.561 --> 00:12:54.490
<v Speaker 3>hospital to get my tonsils removed</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they were like twice the size of</v>

301
00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:57.670
<v Speaker 3>they should be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I had a throat infection and</v>

302
00:12:57.671 --> 00:13:00.490
<v Speaker 3>then it comes to find out I had what's</v>
<v Speaker 3>called the bear to soft goods,</v>

303
00:13:00.491 --> 00:13:05.491
<v Speaker 3>which is like precancer lining my</v>
<v Speaker 3>esophagus from smoking and I don't know,</v>

304
00:13:07.001 --> 00:13:10.000
<v Speaker 3>I guess just abuse over the years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that was,</v>

305
00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:12.070
<v Speaker 3>that's what led to my tonsils being</v>
<v Speaker 3>pulled out.</v>

306
00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:14.530
<v Speaker 3>These are serious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when you think about this,</v>

307
00:13:14.531 --> 00:13:18.400
<v Speaker 3>like you probably shouldn't smoke too</v>
<v Speaker 3>many of those because it's just plain</v>

308
00:13:18.401 --> 00:13:20.050
<v Speaker 3>tobacco.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love,</v>

309
00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:22.030
<v Speaker 3>I love them though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It got to the point where I couldn't</v>

310
00:13:22.031 --> 00:13:25.120
<v Speaker 3>smoke joints.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't smoke out of a bong a pipe.</v>

311
00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:27.520
<v Speaker 3>It had to be a backward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where I am.</v>

312
00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's part of it.</v>

313
00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:30.820
<v Speaker 3>I like them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you ever smoke cigarettes?</v>

314
00:13:30.821 --> 00:13:32.040
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cio date.</v>

315
00:13:32.041 --> 00:13:35.200
<v Speaker 3>I smoked a lot of cigarettes and then I</v>
<v Speaker 3>quit smoking cigarettes.</v>

316
00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:38.920
<v Speaker 3>Just smoked weed and then I discovered</v>
<v Speaker 3>backwoods and I was kinda getting a</v>

317
00:13:38.921 --> 00:13:41.980
<v Speaker 3>little bit of both.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Still getting the tobacco that I missed.</v>

318
00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:44.140
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

319
00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:46.720
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My friend already said that he started</v>

320
00:13:46.721 --> 00:13:49.060
<v Speaker 3>smoking spliffs in England,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

321
00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:51.820
<v Speaker 3>and when he was over in the UK,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the next,</v>

322
00:13:51.821 --> 00:13:55.690
<v Speaker 3>the weed with tobacco and he got totally</v>
<v Speaker 3>hooked on tobacco again because he had</v>

323
00:13:55.691 --> 00:13:59.610
<v Speaker 3>quit cigarettes for years and then he</v>
<v Speaker 3>started smoking the weed mixed with</v>

324
00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:02.230
<v Speaker 3>tobacco and before he knew it he was</v>
<v Speaker 3>smoking cigarettes again.</v>

325
00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:04.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he smoked while he was over there and</v>

326
00:14:04.451 --> 00:14:07.220
<v Speaker 3>then he quit soon as he was done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then came back to you.</v>

327
00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:08.081
<v Speaker 3>US?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

328
00:14:08.081 --> 00:14:10.840
<v Speaker 3>I feel like they just started smoking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just pure weed over there,</v>

329
00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:13.480
<v Speaker 3>Jeffrey bearish for years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was both.</v>

330
00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:15.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand that.</v>

331
00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:16.570
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how'd that,</v>

332
00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:18.170
<v Speaker 3>how'd that work out over there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

333
00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:22.030
<v Speaker 3>So illegal over there too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like Jesus fucking Christ.</v>

334
00:14:22.031 --> 00:14:27.031
<v Speaker 3>It's 2019 fellows times when I used to</v>
<v Speaker 3>fly over there we'd have to take tons of</v>

335
00:14:27.341 --> 00:14:30.250
<v Speaker 3>wheat to our nuts just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just to be able to.</v>

336
00:14:30.251 --> 00:14:33.430
<v Speaker 3>And in our road cases just so we could</v>
<v Speaker 3>smoke over there because they had dirt,</v>

337
00:14:33.431 --> 00:14:34.180
<v Speaker 3>weed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

338
00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:35.230
<v Speaker 3>it was horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'd.</v>

339
00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.420
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a pain in the ass.</v>

340
00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:40.120
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking dangerous bringing that</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff overseas though.</v>

341
00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:41.550
<v Speaker 3>If you get arrested.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>

342
00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:43.210
<v Speaker 3>That's serious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

343
00:14:43.211 --> 00:14:45.520
<v Speaker 3>I brought it aside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bring it everywhere like that.</v>

344
00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:50.550
<v Speaker 3>And we went to tape a gaff tape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus man,</v>

345
00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:55.700
<v Speaker 3>like you teared up the first layer of</v>
<v Speaker 3>your nuts off when you go to grab your</v>

346
00:14:55.701 --> 00:14:56.470
<v Speaker 3>weed.</v>

347
00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:57.590
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we would do that.</v>

348
00:14:57.591 --> 00:14:59.450
<v Speaker 3>And then it's a commitment though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

349
00:14:59.451 --> 00:15:02.660
<v Speaker 3>I actually brought it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I made the big mistake of not bringing a</v>

350
00:15:02.661 --> 00:15:04.100
<v Speaker 3>bunch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I got to Iraq.</v>

351
00:15:04.101 --> 00:15:07.700
<v Speaker 3>We went to Iraq for like right when the</v>
<v Speaker 3>war broke out.</v>

352
00:15:07.701 --> 00:15:11.610
<v Speaker 3>What was it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like 2003 or 2004 and we were over there</v>

353
00:15:11.611 --> 00:15:14.510
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a scandalous Esteban oil,</v>

354
00:15:14.511 --> 00:15:16.530
<v Speaker 3>the photographer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's over there with us documenting the</v>

355
00:15:16.531 --> 00:15:20.840
<v Speaker 3>whole thing and I pull it out because</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're at this airport and ball rain,</v>

356
00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:23.600
<v Speaker 3>but I feel like it's a field and no</v>
<v Speaker 3>one's going to mess with us.</v>

357
00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:25.280
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey bro,</v>

358
00:15:25.281 --> 00:15:26.060
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at,</v>

359
00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:27.500
<v Speaker 3>look at the back of your fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>passport.</v>

360
00:15:27.501 --> 00:15:29.000
<v Speaker 3>Look what it says.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it says right there,</v>

361
00:15:29.001 --> 00:15:32.000
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're basically like they'll kill you</v>

362
00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:33.260
<v Speaker 3>if they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they find,</v>

363
00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:36.360
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You brought any drugs and direct or you</v>

364
00:15:36.361 --> 00:15:39.890
<v Speaker 3>know where we were a ball rain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I did away with everything and I just</v>

365
00:15:39.891 --> 00:15:44.891
<v Speaker 3>kind of took up drinking</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not really much of a drinker but</v>

366
00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:46.430
<v Speaker 3>do you still smoke weed?</v>

367
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.480
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a friend who's like a dear friend</v>

368
00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:53.330
<v Speaker 3>is like a cool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like young doctor named Dr B in San</v>

369
00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:56.510
<v Speaker 3>Diego and I called them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He actually removed my,</v>

370
00:15:56.590 --> 00:16:00.260
<v Speaker 3>my tonsils and then like a week later I</v>
<v Speaker 3>found out I had what was called</v>

371
00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:02.930
<v Speaker 3>precancer Barrett's esophagus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

372
00:16:02.931 --> 00:16:05.000
<v Speaker 3>what does this mean Dr [inaudible]</v>
<v Speaker 3>should I just like,</v>

373
00:16:05.001 --> 00:16:07.520
<v Speaker 3>Kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kinda like toned down like how much I'm</v>

374
00:16:07.521 --> 00:16:08.360
<v Speaker 3>smoking?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>

375
00:16:08.361 --> 00:16:10.670
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this means this is your warning shot.</v>

376
00:16:10.671 --> 00:16:15.490
<v Speaker 3>Like pay attention,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stop smoking esophageal cancers.</v>

377
00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:18.320
<v Speaker 3>A rough one to killed Christopher</v>
<v Speaker 3>hitchins.</v>

378
00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:20.120
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

379
00:16:20.121 --> 00:16:21.470
<v Speaker 3>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a rough one.</v>

380
00:16:21.471 --> 00:16:25.430
<v Speaker 3>That kills a lot of fucking people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once you get it and you're gone,</v>

381
00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:29.030
<v Speaker 3>I think it kills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like think hitch said like 95 percent of</v>

382
00:16:29.031 --> 00:16:31.850
<v Speaker 3>the people get it now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

383
00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:35.090
<v Speaker 3>So I felt like he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's always pretty honest with me and I</v>

384
00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:36.140
<v Speaker 3>just stopped.</v>

385
00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:39.560
<v Speaker 3>Like I love CBD.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty much what I mess with now.</v>

386
00:16:39.561 --> 00:16:44.210
<v Speaker 3>But that's all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you find a lot of people use cbd and</v>

387
00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:46.790
<v Speaker 3>they fund that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It alleviates anxiety and let them sleep</v>

388
00:16:46.791 --> 00:16:48.110
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you find that?</v>

389
00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:51.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as long as I take like triple or</v>

390
00:16:51.081 --> 00:16:54.770
<v Speaker 3>quadruple the amount that it says to</v>
<v Speaker 3>take on the bottle because I feel like</v>

391
00:16:54.771 --> 00:16:57.290
<v Speaker 3>what I take,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I take what the proper dosages,</v>

392
00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:01.820
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't do much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm one of those people whose minds</v>

393
00:17:01.821 --> 00:17:05.390
<v Speaker 3>racing constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll get home from the studio at one or</v>

394
00:17:05.391 --> 00:17:09.500
<v Speaker 3>two and I'm just like kind of like</v>
<v Speaker 3>figuring out how long I got to sleep</v>

395
00:17:09.501 --> 00:17:13.040
<v Speaker 3>before I get to wake up my kids and go</v>
<v Speaker 3>to school and I just sat there with my</v>

396
00:17:13.041 --> 00:17:16.790
<v Speaker 3>wheels spinning and less.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I use cbd and then that kind of helps.</v>

397
00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:19.910
<v Speaker 3>And then I had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have what's called trigeminal</v>

398
00:17:19.911 --> 00:17:20.480
<v Speaker 3>neuralgia.</v>

399
00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:21.650
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever heard of that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

400
00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:22.910
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the fucking worst.</v>

401
00:17:22.911 --> 00:17:26.780
<v Speaker 3>It's called the suicide disease because</v>
<v Speaker 3>basically all of your nerves in your</v>

402
00:17:26.781 --> 00:17:31.700
<v Speaker 3>face or firing all at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it almost feels like what you feel</v>

403
00:17:31.701 --> 00:17:34.550
<v Speaker 3>when you think you need a root canal or</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have like a tooth that's messed up,</v>

404
00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:39.230
<v Speaker 3>but I got trigeminal Neuralgia and I've</v>
<v Speaker 3>only had four episodes,</v>

405
00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:42.050
<v Speaker 3>but when I do get it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I use cbd and it.</v>

406
00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:44.930
<v Speaker 3>It's been amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you look it up,</v>

407
00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:47.450
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people go actually go to a</v>
<v Speaker 3>dentist,</v>

408
00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:52.470
<v Speaker 3>get a bunch of root canals done that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't need or they don't know how</v>

409
00:17:52.471 --> 00:17:55.110
<v Speaker 3>to treat it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and usually people kill themselves.</v>

410
00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:56.280
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

411
00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:57.800
<v Speaker 3>It's gnarly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't really know about it.</v>

412
00:17:57.810 --> 00:17:58.980
<v Speaker 3>I just was home with Dan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

413
00:17:58.981 --> 00:18:02.010
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like my face is burning.</v>

414
00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:05.813
<v Speaker 3>It's miserable</v>

415
00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:08.900
<v Speaker 4>pain condition that affects the</v>
<v Speaker 4>trigeminal nerve,</v>

416
00:18:08.901 --> 00:18:11.150
<v Speaker 4>which carries a sensation for your face</v>
<v Speaker 4>to your brain.</v>

417
00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:14.930
<v Speaker 4>If you have trigeminal Neuralgia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even mild stimulation of your face,</v>

418
00:18:14.931 --> 00:18:18.650
<v Speaker 4>such as from brushing your teeth or</v>
<v Speaker 4>putting on makeup may trigger a jolt of</v>

419
00:18:18.651 --> 00:18:21.230
<v Speaker 4>excruciating pain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit Man.</v>

420
00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:23.810
<v Speaker 4>What is the cause?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What causes that?</v>

421
00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:26.120
<v Speaker 3>All different things they thought like</v>
<v Speaker 3>mine,</v>

422
00:18:26.121 --> 00:18:30.620
<v Speaker 3>I maybe got mind from impact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like from my accident and then maybe</v>

423
00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:34.100
<v Speaker 3>little sparring that I've done has,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has triggered it.</v>

424
00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:37.130
<v Speaker 3>Also dental,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I get dental work done,</v>

425
00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:42.090
<v Speaker 3>it triggers it so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the CBD stops it cbd in it.</v>

426
00:18:42.091 --> 00:18:44.290
<v Speaker 3>If it's really bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's um,</v>

427
00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:48.170
<v Speaker 3>this medication called Gabba Pinton.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

428
00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:53.000
<v Speaker 3>and I feel like that's been a real great</v>
<v Speaker 3>way to kind of mask the pain.</v>

429
00:18:53.001 --> 00:18:56.360
<v Speaker 3>And what once the Gabapentin calms the</v>
<v Speaker 3>nerves kind of duds the nerve.</v>

430
00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:58.940
<v Speaker 3>Twenty four,</v>
<v Speaker 3>48 hours it's gone.</v>

431
00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:02.120
<v Speaker 3>If it's a really bad episode of it's not</v>
<v Speaker 3>so bad,</v>

432
00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:04.910
<v Speaker 4>it just keeps it away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

433
00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:09.410
<v Speaker 4>they see that a lot of nerve diseases</v>
<v Speaker 4>are inflammation caused.</v>

434
00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:11.780
<v Speaker 4>So sometimes like if you change your</v>
<v Speaker 4>diet,</v>

435
00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:13.550
<v Speaker 4>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can smooth some of those out,</v>

436
00:19:13.551 --> 00:19:16.790
<v Speaker 4>like lower the sugar intake and some of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the other things that might be causing</v>

437
00:19:16.791 --> 00:19:19.010
<v Speaker 4>inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did they give you any advice like that</v>

438
00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:21.490
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but around the same time I figured out I</v>

439
00:19:21.491 --> 00:19:24.730
<v Speaker 3>was allergic to gluten,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I really thought was horse shit,</v>

440
00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:25.391
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

441
00:19:25.391 --> 00:19:25.871
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

442
00:19:25.871 --> 00:19:26.471
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

443
00:19:26.471 --> 00:19:28.400
<v Speaker 3>we need to be gluten free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

444
00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:32.170
<v Speaker 3>then I tried it and the doctor I had</v>
<v Speaker 3>seen said,</v>

445
00:19:32.171 --> 00:19:35.380
<v Speaker 3>well you really got to try it though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to commit 100 percent,</v>

446
00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:38.500
<v Speaker 3>you got to give it at least like two to</v>
<v Speaker 3>three weeks and see how you feel.</v>

447
00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:43.300
<v Speaker 3>And I did it and it was a game changer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I felt normal.</v>

448
00:19:43.301 --> 00:19:46.750
<v Speaker 3>Whereas I'd have a lot of ups and downs</v>
<v Speaker 3>depending on what I was eating and I'm</v>

449
00:19:46.751 --> 00:19:49.330
<v Speaker 3>still eating clean at the time I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>still eating Vegan,</v>

450
00:19:49.331 --> 00:19:50.071
<v Speaker 3>I'm eating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

451
00:19:50.071 --> 00:19:55.071
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But a lot of a lot of us can't digest</v>

452
00:19:55.461 --> 00:19:57.550
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or kind of our bodies can absorb the</v>

453
00:19:57.551 --> 00:19:58.110
<v Speaker 3>gluten.</v>

454
00:19:58.110 --> 00:19:58.943
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well it's.</v>

455
00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:02.340
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever had pasta in Europe?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very different.</v>

456
00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:04.460
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So much shit in ours,</v>

457
00:20:04.461 --> 00:20:05.294
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so much.</v>

458
00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:08.910
<v Speaker 4>Well it's the Maynard Maynard Keenan</v>
<v Speaker 4>from tool.</v>

459
00:20:08.911 --> 00:20:11.760
<v Speaker 4>He explained it to you because you know</v>
<v Speaker 4>he runs in Austria in Arizona.</v>

460
00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:12.750
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

461
00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:15.120
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's the guy's a fucking wizard man.</v>

462
00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:20.300
<v Speaker 4>He's got his own winery runs in Austria,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he said that when we subsequently</v>

463
00:20:22.951 --> 00:20:25.350
<v Speaker 4>looked it up after he told me this in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

464
00:20:25.351 --> 00:20:28.050
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>early turn of the century when they were</v>

465
00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:31.680
<v Speaker 4>growing wheat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they experimented and change the wheat</v>

466
00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:36.450
<v Speaker 4>to make it more dense so that you could</v>
<v Speaker 4>get more yield out of an acre.</v>

467
00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:41.610
<v Speaker 4>And so by doing that they changed what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how your body processes it and is more</v>

468
00:20:41.611 --> 00:20:44.160
<v Speaker 4>complex gluten's in like a stock of</v>
<v Speaker 4>wheat,</v>

469
00:20:44.161 --> 00:20:47.920
<v Speaker 4>like an old old timey wheat like you</v>
<v Speaker 4>would get like in Italy or France or</v>

470
00:20:47.921 --> 00:20:48.754
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>

471
00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:50.320
<v Speaker 4>It's a different wheat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It looks different.</v>

472
00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:54.430
<v Speaker 4>It's a much more scrawny looking plant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so if they had an acre that you</v>

473
00:20:54.431 --> 00:20:57.910
<v Speaker 4>don't get nearly as much wheat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so in America we said,</v>

474
00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:00.520
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>boogers boater and we made it bigger and</v>

475
00:21:00.521 --> 00:21:03.880
<v Speaker 4>better and thicker and your body has a</v>
<v Speaker 4>much harder time processing it.</v>

476
00:21:03.881 --> 00:21:07.240
<v Speaker 4>And that's why people get so much</v>
<v Speaker 4>inflammation and leaky gut and all these</v>

477
00:21:07.241 --> 00:21:11.560
<v Speaker 4>different ailments that people get from</v>
<v Speaker 4>bread and pasta in this country.</v>

478
00:21:11.561 --> 00:21:14.200
<v Speaker 4>It's because of this much more complex.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We.</v>

479
00:21:14.201 --> 00:21:17.770
<v Speaker 4>But I buy pasta overseas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I buy this,</v>

480
00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:21.520
<v Speaker 4>I'm God dammit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll say the name of it.</v>

481
00:21:21.521 --> 00:21:24.220
<v Speaker 4>It's I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I found out about it in Italy that they</v>

482
00:21:24.221 --> 00:21:26.740
<v Speaker 4>sell it in America.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just for that reason.</v>

483
00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:29.740
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I can eat it and if I want</v>

484
00:21:29.741 --> 00:21:31.930
<v Speaker 4>pasta,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not that disgusting.</v>

485
00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:34.900
<v Speaker 4>I'm fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love Pasta.</v>

486
00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:36.690
<v Speaker 4>I do too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's just,</v>

487
00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:41.200
<v Speaker 4>it's something that I've found if I eat</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of it just fucks me so I have to</v>

488
00:21:41.201 --> 00:21:42.220
<v Speaker 4>make sure that I don't.</v>

489
00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:46.690
<v Speaker 4>Let me find it real quick and I'll pull</v>
<v Speaker 4>up the name of it and I felt like leaky</v>

490
00:21:46.691 --> 00:21:47.800
<v Speaker 4>gut,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was like a hoax.</v>

491
00:21:47.801 --> 00:21:49.150
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are you talking about?</v>

492
00:21:49.151 --> 00:21:52.830
<v Speaker 4>I've never even heard about this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I feel like it's legit and they're</v>

493
00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:56.950
<v Speaker 4>spot on about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's called Morelli,</v>

494
00:21:56.950 --> 00:22:00.490
<v Speaker 4>Morelli Spaghetti and it's from Italy</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the type of wheat that they use,</v>

495
00:22:00.491 --> 00:22:02.800
<v Speaker 4>it's a very different type of wheat I</v>
<v Speaker 4>get.</v>

496
00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:05.680
<v Speaker 4>It tastes different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't blow you up as much.</v>

497
00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:09.580
<v Speaker 4>It's A.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think somebody explained it to me like</v>

498
00:22:09.581 --> 00:22:14.581
<v Speaker 4>what kind of wheat you're looking for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what I found is that I've tried the</v>

499
00:22:15.101 --> 00:22:19.540
<v Speaker 4>gluten free pasta and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I like better than gluten</v>

500
00:22:19.541 --> 00:22:21.640
<v Speaker 4>free pasta,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Spaghetti squash,</v>

501
00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:25.720
<v Speaker 4>spaghetti squash with Marinara sauce.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking delicious.</v>

502
00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:28.810
<v Speaker 4>And I actually sometimes like it better</v>
<v Speaker 4>than pasta,</v>

503
00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:31.270
<v Speaker 4>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they sell that at Erewhon all the time</v>

504
00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:32.620
<v Speaker 4>in the hot part.</v>

505
00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:35.720
<v Speaker 4>It's spaghetti squash is outstanding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

506
00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:37.540
<v Speaker 4>And it's guilt free,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

507
00:22:37.541 --> 00:22:38.374
<v Speaker 4>you can eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>

508
00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:41.140
<v Speaker 4>you're not thinking you're bloating</v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself up.</v>

509
00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:43.420
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But we've ruined pasta.</v>

510
00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:45.770
<v Speaker 4>We ruined ruined pot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

511
00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:47.260
<v Speaker 4>it gives you that feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

512
00:22:47.261 --> 00:22:48.720
<v Speaker 4>that feeling you get after you eat a lot</v>
<v Speaker 4>of it,</v>

513
00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:49.800
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

514
00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:51.160
<v Speaker 4>that's what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or your body's like,</v>

515
00:22:51.161 --> 00:22:53.410
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck am I doing with this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

516
00:22:53.411 --> 00:22:57.220
<v Speaker 4>you're immediately tired loaded.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you eat an Italy,</v>

517
00:22:57.221 --> 00:22:59.860
<v Speaker 4>you don't get that feeling and you look</v>
<v Speaker 4>at those people over there,</v>

518
00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:01.810
<v Speaker 4>they're not fat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's weird.</v>

519
00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:04.060
<v Speaker 4>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

520
00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:07.460
<v Speaker 4>They're walking around all over the</v>
<v Speaker 4>place and they're eating pasta and</v>

521
00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:10.750
<v Speaker 4>Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everyone's walking or riding bikes.</v>

522
00:23:10.751 --> 00:23:12.490
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Americans.</v>

523
00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:14.920
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the thing about France to France,</v>

524
00:23:14.921 --> 00:23:16.920
<v Speaker 4>when they're eating those baguettes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

525
00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:21.070
<v Speaker 4>they're eating it with this very rich</v>
<v Speaker 4>butter that's like a grass fed butter.</v>

526
00:23:21.071 --> 00:23:24.540
<v Speaker 4>It's a dark yellow butter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's very high fat content.</v>

527
00:23:24.541 --> 00:23:28.820
<v Speaker 4>It's got a lot of essential fatty acids</v>
<v Speaker 4>in it just you're just getting in.</v>

528
00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:32.470
<v Speaker 4>It's a different kind of bread to and</v>
<v Speaker 4>meanwhile they're not fat and they're</v>

529
00:23:32.471 --> 00:23:35.320
<v Speaker 4>drinking one and they're not fat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it doesn't make any sense.</v>

530
00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:37.540
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>agreed.</v>

531
00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:40.300
<v Speaker 4>Standard American Diet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just fucked up,</v>

532
00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:44.630
<v Speaker 4>but I've always wanted to ask you that</v>
<v Speaker 4>about like the drumming because I mean</v>

533
00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:46.250
<v Speaker 4>everything that I do</v>

534
00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:49.880
<v Speaker 2>like everything repetitive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's boxing or even archery.</v>

535
00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:53.870
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people get injuries and archery</v>
<v Speaker 2>just from repetitive stress from just</v>

536
00:23:53.871 --> 00:23:55.700
<v Speaker 2>pulling the bow back over and over</v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

537
00:23:55.701 --> 00:23:57.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God Damn Travis,</v>

538
00:23:57.231 --> 00:23:59.240
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your whole fucking thing is repetitive.</v>

539
00:23:59.241 --> 00:24:02.230
<v Speaker 2>It's like I see you every time I see</v>
<v Speaker 2>like my,</v>

540
00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:03.170
<v Speaker 2>my shoulders hurt,</v>

541
00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:06.970
<v Speaker 3>my elbows hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm in my first week hurts.</v>

542
00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:09.070
<v Speaker 3>My first week sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like on tour,</v>

543
00:24:09.071 --> 00:24:13.300
<v Speaker 3>really like getting acclimated because</v>
<v Speaker 3>even practice rehearsals are not a show.</v>

544
00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:15.190
<v Speaker 3>It's just a different intensity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

545
00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:17.590
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as long as I trained for it,</v>

546
00:24:17.591 --> 00:24:22.060
<v Speaker 3>I'm cool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kinda like boxing has helped so much</v>

547
00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:26.470
<v Speaker 3>and I don't box because I think I'm a</v>
<v Speaker 3>tough guy or I think I can beat people's</v>

548
00:24:26.471 --> 00:24:29.860
<v Speaker 3>asses or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really just for functionality,</v>

549
00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:32.490
<v Speaker 3>like so I can play the drums the way I</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to say.</v>

550
00:24:32.491 --> 00:24:34.960
<v Speaker 3>And I started doing it for that reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well No,</v>

551
00:24:34.961 --> 00:24:37.810
<v Speaker 3>I started when I knew my son was being</v>
<v Speaker 3>born,</v>

552
00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:39.730
<v Speaker 3>like when my girlfriend at the time was</v>
<v Speaker 3>pregnant,</v>

553
00:24:40.150 --> 00:24:45.070
<v Speaker 3>I woke up that morning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I ran to the freeway and back like twice</v>

554
00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:48.460
<v Speaker 3>and then I wouldn't found a boxing gym.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I walked into 10 goose.</v>

555
00:24:48.461 --> 00:24:52.600
<v Speaker 3>I actually walked into John Prays who</v>
<v Speaker 3>used to be Tyson sparring partner,</v>

556
00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:58.250
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was like 2005 to 2003.</v>

557
00:24:59.230 --> 00:25:03.380
<v Speaker 3>And then I started boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just walked into 10 goose and I,</v>

558
00:25:03.381 --> 00:25:07.270
<v Speaker 3>I started jump roping and hitting pads</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't know,</v>

559
00:25:07.271 --> 00:25:12.190
<v Speaker 3>I just had this urge to want to like box</v>
<v Speaker 3>and be better.</v>

560
00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:14.860
<v Speaker 3>That's so interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like just knowing that you were going to</v>

561
00:25:14.861 --> 00:25:16.690
<v Speaker 3>be a dad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just wanted it to be better.</v>

562
00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:20.620
<v Speaker 3>I wanted like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>immediately I just thought to myself I</v>

563
00:25:20.621 --> 00:25:24.220
<v Speaker 3>wanted a lifestyle change,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I needed to evolve and I needed to know</v>

564
00:25:24.221 --> 00:25:29.221
<v Speaker 3>how to protect this little human I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>bringing into the world and I knew I</v>

565
00:25:29.231 --> 00:25:31.180
<v Speaker 3>needed to change my lifestyle because I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was</v>

566
00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:34.560
<v Speaker 2>kind of out of control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

567
00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:38.420
<v Speaker 2>It's an amazing thing that happens to</v>
<v Speaker 2>you when you become a father.</v>

568
00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:41.720
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird switch that goes off in</v>
<v Speaker 2>your brain that you can't really</v>

569
00:25:41.721 --> 00:25:44.000
<v Speaker 2>describe to people that don't have kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

570
00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:46.340
<v Speaker 2>And it's even weirder when the switch</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't go off.</v>

571
00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:48.050
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

572
00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:52.030
<v Speaker 2>you see people who are horrible father's</v>
<v Speaker 2>parents and I just don't get like,</v>

573
00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:55.010
<v Speaker 2>how didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how did that switch turned on for you?</v>

574
00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:58.460
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how like the ones who don't want to be</v>

575
00:25:58.461 --> 00:26:00.710
<v Speaker 2>around the kids freaked me out the most.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

576
00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:03.530
<v Speaker 2>They just don't want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just want to be away all the time.</v>

577
00:26:03.531 --> 00:26:04.490
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't get it.</v>

578
00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:05.810
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why.</v>

579
00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:07.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't imagine.</v>

580
00:26:07.101 --> 00:26:09.050
<v Speaker 3>But yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now I love boxing.</v>

581
00:26:09.051 --> 00:26:11.150
<v Speaker 3>Like it's one of my favorite things to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

582
00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:15.080
<v Speaker 3>I've been doing Muay Thai a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 3>more because I can kind of save my hands</v>

583
00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:17.510
<v Speaker 3>because it's not good on my hands in any</v>
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>

584
00:26:17.511 --> 00:26:18.344
<v Speaker 3>shape,</v>
<v Speaker 3>perform.</v>

585
00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:21.250
<v Speaker 2>How so?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just the impact over and over.</v>

586
00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:24.800
<v Speaker 2>Do you feel professionally wrapped?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get umbrella correctly,</v>

587
00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:27.580
<v Speaker 2>but it still bothers my knuckles hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

588
00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:29.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you using big heavy gloves?</v>

589
00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:31.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a one ounce gloves are you using?</v>

590
00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:36.400
<v Speaker 2>I think there are 14 ounce.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe she'd switch to like 18 or 20.</v>

591
00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:39.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get a thicker padding in the front.</v>

592
00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:41.980
<v Speaker 2>It'll protect your knuckles better and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it even gives you a better workout</v>

593
00:26:41.981 --> 00:26:43.200
<v Speaker 2>really because you're pushing more</v>
<v Speaker 2>weight.</v>

594
00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:44.083
<v Speaker 2>A little heavier.</v>

595
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:46.020
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pushing more weight and you'll have</v>

596
00:26:46.021 --> 00:26:47.370
<v Speaker 4>more,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more impact.</v>

597
00:26:47.371 --> 00:26:50.320
<v Speaker 4>But another thing I would say is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

598
00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:52.350
<v Speaker 4>get a bag.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a water bag.</v>

599
00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:55.050
<v Speaker 4>Water bags are fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever seen those before?</v>

600
00:26:55.051 --> 00:26:58.230
<v Speaker 4>I've seen him at the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get awesome fucking dig into those</v>

601
00:26:58.231 --> 00:27:00.570
<v Speaker 4>things and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's minimal impact,</v>

602
00:27:00.571 --> 00:27:02.550
<v Speaker 4>but you still pushing the same amount of</v>
<v Speaker 4>weight,</v>

603
00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:04.410
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>through throwing the punches.</v>

604
00:27:04.411 --> 00:27:06.300
<v Speaker 4>You can still explode at the same amount</v>
<v Speaker 4>of force,</v>

605
00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:08.790
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're sinking into that bag.</v>

606
00:27:08.791 --> 00:27:13.791
<v Speaker 4>And so a lot of people with tendinitis</v>
<v Speaker 4>find that that's a way better option is</v>

607
00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:14.663
<v Speaker 4>another.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

608
00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:16.630
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have two bags out there.</v>

609
00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:21.660
<v Speaker 4>One of them's a fair tax bag and fair</v>
<v Speaker 4>texts makes it's a Moitai bag,</v>

610
00:27:21.961 --> 00:27:24.540
<v Speaker 4>but it's softer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the other one's a monster bag.</v>

611
00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:27.380
<v Speaker 4>The monster bags are really hard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dense,</v>

612
00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:30.120
<v Speaker 4>dense as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I like the combination of the two,</v>

613
00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:31.770
<v Speaker 4>but the fair one is good.</v>

614
00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:33.870
<v Speaker 4>If I'm injured,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if like my shoulder's bothering me or</v>

615
00:27:33.871 --> 00:27:36.540
<v Speaker 4>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can dig into that bag and it's not</v>

616
00:27:36.541 --> 00:27:39.990
<v Speaker 4>going to have the same jolt is hitting</v>
<v Speaker 4>something solid and hard.</v>

617
00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:41.520
<v Speaker 4>So if you're having problems with your</v>
<v Speaker 4>hands,</v>

618
00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:44.790
<v Speaker 4>that's what I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Another thing you can do is they make</v>

619
00:27:44.791 --> 00:27:47.460
<v Speaker 4>wraps that are gel wraps.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You slide them on your hand,</v>

620
00:27:47.461 --> 00:27:48.770
<v Speaker 4>almost like a glove.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

621
00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:50.700
<v Speaker 4>that's what he just told me about as I</v>
<v Speaker 4>trained with.</v>

622
00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:52.200
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those are great.</v>

623
00:27:52.410 --> 00:27:54.600
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then that on top of the heavier</v>

624
00:27:54.601 --> 00:27:56.640
<v Speaker 4>glove,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I bet it'll stop all the hand stuff.</v>

625
00:27:56.980 --> 00:27:57.550
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

626
00:27:57.550 --> 00:27:58.331
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to try that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

627
00:27:58.331 --> 00:28:00.370
<v Speaker 3>he just told me about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That'll protect my knuckles a little bit</v>

628
00:28:00.371 --> 00:28:04.150
<v Speaker 3>more because I find if I lift weights I</v>
<v Speaker 3>never get big.</v>

629
00:28:04.151 --> 00:28:09.151
<v Speaker 3>Like I never look big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I feel kind of stiff and just slow.</v>

630
00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:13.030
<v Speaker 3>It's the worst feeling ever and I did it</v>
<v Speaker 3>one time right before tour I had,</v>

631
00:28:13.390 --> 00:28:16.660
<v Speaker 3>I was living in Cheviot hills for a</v>
<v Speaker 3>little while and I was working out at a</v>

632
00:28:16.661 --> 00:28:19.450
<v Speaker 3>gym over there and it was all</v>
<v Speaker 3>bodybuilder guys and I would train with</v>

633
00:28:19.451 --> 00:28:23.590
<v Speaker 3>one just to like be pushed and I got</v>
<v Speaker 3>behind my kit and it was the worst</v>

634
00:28:23.591 --> 00:28:25.330
<v Speaker 3>feeling ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The worst.</v>

635
00:28:25.331 --> 00:28:29.800
<v Speaker 3>I felt like it was in slow motion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I figured out like I need to train</v>

636
00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:33.130
<v Speaker 3>how I want to move when I'm actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>playing the drums.</v>

637
00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:36.450
<v Speaker 4>Weightlifting is fine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you have to do it lightly.</v>

638
00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:39.810
<v Speaker 4>The thing about weightlifting is people</v>
<v Speaker 4>want to do it to failure all the time.</v>

639
00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:43.140
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do 10 sets of this and five sets of that</v>

640
00:28:43.141 --> 00:28:45.000
<v Speaker 4>and go to failure every time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Come on,</v>

641
00:28:45.001 --> 00:28:45.481
<v Speaker 4>push,</v>
<v Speaker 4>push,</v>

642
00:28:45.481 --> 00:28:46.314
<v Speaker 4>push,</v>
<v Speaker 4>push.</v>

643
00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:48.420
<v Speaker 4>Don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You shouldn't do that.</v>

644
00:28:48.990 --> 00:28:51.690
<v Speaker 4>I subscribed to the Pavel Tat Salini</v>
<v Speaker 4>method.</v>

645
00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:57.690
<v Speaker 4>He's a famous Russian Kettlebell</v>
<v Speaker 4>instructor and his philosophy is that</v>

646
00:28:57.930 --> 00:29:01.500
<v Speaker 4>you should do more sets but less</v>
<v Speaker 4>repetition.</v>

647
00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:04.830
<v Speaker 4>So like say if you could do a weight and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could lift it 10 times,</v>

648
00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:09.770
<v Speaker 4>don't lift at 10 times lived at five.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He lifted 10 bucks going on my voice.</v>

649
00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:15.600
<v Speaker 4>All this talk about esophageal cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My Voice is rebelling,</v>

650
00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:18.570
<v Speaker 4>but if you say if you could lift</v>
<v Speaker 4>something 10 times,</v>

651
00:29:18.571 --> 00:29:23.460
<v Speaker 4>lifted five times and just do more sets</v>
<v Speaker 4>and give yourself a lot of time in</v>

652
00:29:23.461 --> 00:29:25.650
<v Speaker 4>between sets because if you're training</v>
<v Speaker 4>for strength,</v>

653
00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:30.210
<v Speaker 4>you can do certain things like</v>
<v Speaker 4>kettlebells and specific where it's</v>

654
00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:31.650
<v Speaker 4>strength but it's also endurance.</v>

655
00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:33.990
<v Speaker 4>But really if you just want to do</v>
<v Speaker 4>strength,</v>

656
00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:39.020
<v Speaker 4>the best way to do it is to do a short</v>
<v Speaker 4>set of a few repetitions and then do</v>

657
00:29:41.231 --> 00:29:44.740
<v Speaker 4>multiple versions of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like take a long time off like five,</v>

658
00:29:44.741 --> 00:29:46.780
<v Speaker 4>10 minutes and then do another five</v>
<v Speaker 4>reps,</v>

659
00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:47.763
<v Speaker 4>five,</v>
<v Speaker 4>10 minutes,</v>

660
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:51.940
<v Speaker 4>do another five reps and then do it</v>
<v Speaker 4>again in a couple of days and then do it</v>

661
00:29:51.941 --> 00:29:54.700
<v Speaker 4>again instead of like once a week where</v>
<v Speaker 4>you just blow your body out and then</v>

662
00:29:54.701 --> 00:29:55.840
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ah.</v>

663
00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:58.550
<v Speaker 4>That feeling where you can barely move.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's terrible.</v>

664
00:29:58.870 --> 00:30:01.630
<v Speaker 4>It's not a smart way because you don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>recover as well.</v>

665
00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:03.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you ended up getting hurt or having</v>

666
00:30:03.771 --> 00:30:05.180
<v Speaker 3>to take a day off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

667
00:30:05.181 --> 00:30:08.210
<v Speaker 3>what I started doing was with this one</v>
<v Speaker 3>trainer named Don,</v>

668
00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:10.520
<v Speaker 3>we figured out kind of like a metronome</v>
<v Speaker 3>workout.</v>

669
00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:16.160
<v Speaker 3>So you're actually like a tempo workout</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you're training to a tempo so you</v>

670
00:30:16.161 --> 00:30:17.720
<v Speaker 3>have to do high reps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you know,</v>

671
00:30:17.721 --> 00:30:20.690
<v Speaker 3>you'll stay to a minute and maybe the</v>
<v Speaker 3>tempo is like,</v>

672
00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:23.510
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So whatever.</v>

673
00:30:23.511 --> 00:30:27.800
<v Speaker 3>Even if it's quick and you're not doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything like exactly technique wise,</v>

674
00:30:27.801 --> 00:30:30.460
<v Speaker 3>really slow and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

675
00:30:30.490 --> 00:30:32.930
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of like making sure you stay</v>
<v Speaker 3>up with the tempo,</v>

676
00:30:32.931 --> 00:30:37.250
<v Speaker 3>which I feel like really helped me with</v>
<v Speaker 3>staying quick and fast with drums and</v>

677
00:30:37.251 --> 00:30:38.450
<v Speaker 3>more endurance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

678
00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:39.490
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That makes sense.</v>

679
00:30:39.490 --> 00:30:42.690
<v Speaker 4>Like his drumming a young man's game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

680
00:30:42.691 --> 00:30:45.000
<v Speaker 4>is it like athletics where as you get</v>
<v Speaker 4>older,</v>

681
00:30:45.001 --> 00:30:46.050
<v Speaker 4>drummer slowdown?</v>

682
00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:48.570
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't.</v>

683
00:30:48.690 --> 00:30:50.850
<v Speaker 3>I played just as wild as I did back in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the day.</v>

684
00:30:50.851 --> 00:30:51.684
<v Speaker 3>And how old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

685
00:30:51.690 --> 00:30:53.520
<v Speaker 3>43.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You look great.</v>

686
00:30:53.690 --> 00:30:54.990
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't look 43.</v>

687
00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:57.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Max Weinberg told me one time he was,</v>

688
00:30:57.150 --> 00:31:00.930
<v Speaker 3>he watched me play and he was like at a</v>
<v Speaker 3>show or blink played and he's like,</v>

689
00:31:00.931 --> 00:31:02.310
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how much longer you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>play.</v>

690
00:31:02.311 --> 00:31:05.460
<v Speaker 3>Like that real hard dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

691
00:31:05.490 --> 00:31:08.310
<v Speaker 3>you're going to need back surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You play like you rabies.</v>

692
00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:11.760
<v Speaker 3>Just smashing the fucking drums.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So knock on wood,</v>

693
00:31:11.761 --> 00:31:15.540
<v Speaker 3>nothing has changed and I've just a play</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly how I always have,</v>

694
00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:16.830
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

695
00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:19.800
<v Speaker 3>I don't even want to think about a day</v>
<v Speaker 3>where I have to play any different.</v>

696
00:31:20.370 --> 00:31:21.090
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'll come.</v>

697
00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:23.250
<v Speaker 3>But do you get massages?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

698
00:31:23.410 --> 00:31:24.740
<v Speaker 3>That'll help.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

699
00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:27.330
<v Speaker 3>Massages,</v>
<v Speaker 3>epson salt baths.</v>

700
00:31:29.170 --> 00:31:30.550
<v Speaker 4>That's where the tank comes in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Play,</v>

701
00:31:30.551 --> 00:31:31.990
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That thing looks amazing.</v>

702
00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:34.120
<v Speaker 4>The tank is all epsom salts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at you dude.</v>

703
00:31:34.490 --> 00:31:38.500
<v Speaker 4>You're fucking crazy</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you watch that.</v>

704
00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:40.600
<v Speaker 4>I watch you play.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I would just go,</v>

705
00:31:40.601 --> 00:31:45.280
<v Speaker 4>how the fuck is this guy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maintain this pace because everybody</v>

706
00:31:45.281 --> 00:31:46.540
<v Speaker 4>drums differently.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

707
00:31:46.541 --> 00:31:48.100
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's really interesting to watch</v>

708
00:31:48.101 --> 00:31:51.730
<v Speaker 4>people's different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Especially my friend bill burr really</v>

709
00:31:51.731 --> 00:31:53.800
<v Speaker 4>got into drumming and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

710
00:31:53.801 --> 00:31:55.870
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's really into it and I like watching</v>

711
00:31:55.871 --> 00:31:58.000
<v Speaker 4>them play and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's interesting to see someone take</v>

712
00:31:58.001 --> 00:32:00.940
<v Speaker 4>something up and get better and take</v>
<v Speaker 4>lessons and learn it.</v>

713
00:32:00.941 --> 00:32:05.941
<v Speaker 4>But the thing that really strikes me is</v>
<v Speaker 4>how many repetitions are involved.</v>

714
00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:08.150
<v Speaker 4>Like as you're doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the,</v>

715
00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:12.220
<v Speaker 4>the amount of times you're hitting these</v>
<v Speaker 4>drums is fucking insanity.</v>

716
00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:15.770
<v Speaker 3>You got to pace yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it's a two hour set,</v>

717
00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:17.120
<v Speaker 3>I know like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

718
00:32:17.121 --> 00:32:19.070
<v Speaker 3>this is a verse of the song.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can kind of.</v>

719
00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:21.200
<v Speaker 3>This is not a big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>big part,</v>

720
00:32:21.250 --> 00:32:22.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can kind of show,</v>

721
00:32:22.311 --> 00:32:23.900
<v Speaker 3>but it's like around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

722
00:32:23.901 --> 00:32:26.420
<v Speaker 3>if you're doing around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look up at the clock and you realize,</v>

723
00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:28.010
<v Speaker 3>Oh wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still have two minutes left,</v>

724
00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:30.830
<v Speaker 3>we'll pace yourself and you know what I</v>
<v Speaker 3>mean?</v>

725
00:32:30.850 --> 00:32:32.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's kind of how I approached shows,</v>

726
00:32:32.451 --> 00:32:35.090
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the goal is to train so much before</v>

727
00:32:35.091 --> 00:32:38.480
<v Speaker 3>you even get on tour that you're not</v>
<v Speaker 3>even having to think about that.</v>

728
00:32:38.550 --> 00:32:40.640
<v Speaker 3>You're just playing the show exactly how</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to play.</v>

729
00:32:40.641 --> 00:32:42.950
<v Speaker 3>It's almost,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I imagine it's like that with fighting</v>

730
00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:47.990
<v Speaker 3>where you envision what you want to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>in your head and you're in the shape and</v>

731
00:32:47.991 --> 00:32:50.210
<v Speaker 3>you know the technique to execute.</v>

732
00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:51.970
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to think about our like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

733
00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:52.940
<v Speaker 3>I can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>

734
00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:56.300
<v Speaker 3>I didn't practice that enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to be able to just do whatever</v>

735
00:32:56.990 --> 00:32:59.840
<v Speaker 3>I'm feeling and not be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh shit,</v>

736
00:32:59.841 --> 00:33:03.530
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how to do that or I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get tired if I do that.</v>

737
00:33:03.531 --> 00:33:05.300
<v Speaker 3>I don't want that to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

738
00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:08.990
<v Speaker 3>So that's the goal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just being able to execute what you</v>

739
00:33:08.991 --> 00:33:11.840
<v Speaker 3>have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea in your head won't musicians</v>

740
00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:14.630
<v Speaker 3>have to have discipline because you have</v>
<v Speaker 3>to practice.</v>

741
00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:19.820
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the things that makes you</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys so unique in the entertainment</v>

742
00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:20.900
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

743
00:33:20.901 --> 00:33:23.090
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess maybe actress have to practice</v>

744
00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:25.460
<v Speaker 3>standup comedians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We only practice in front of an</v>

745
00:33:25.461 --> 00:33:29.470
<v Speaker 3>audience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you guys have to fucking practice.</v>

746
00:33:29.670 --> 00:33:32.120
<v Speaker 3>We don't go through your show before you</v>
<v Speaker 3>go out.</v>

747
00:33:32.290 --> 00:33:36.260
<v Speaker 3>Now I write,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I write and I listened to recordings of</v>

748
00:33:36.261 --> 00:33:38.780
<v Speaker 3>old sets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't like to sit in front of a</v>

749
00:33:38.781 --> 00:33:39.290
<v Speaker 3>mirror goal.</v>

750
00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:40.930
<v Speaker 3>Hey folks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

751
00:33:41.230 --> 00:33:43.340
<v Speaker 3>don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know anybody because it would</v>

752
00:33:43.341 --> 00:33:45.920
<v Speaker 3>feel so weird when you go up to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would feel rehearsed,</v>

753
00:33:45.921 --> 00:33:46.910
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

754
00:33:46.911 --> 00:33:49.250
<v Speaker 3>That's the last thing you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to be in the moment.</v>

755
00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:52.420
<v Speaker 3>Same thing happens with a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you practice too much as a band and</v>

756
00:33:52.421 --> 00:33:54.410
<v Speaker 3>the ego,</v>
<v Speaker 3>try to play those songs and act like</v>

757
00:33:54.411 --> 00:33:56.360
<v Speaker 3>you're having fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That happens.</v>

758
00:33:57.050 --> 00:34:01.100
<v Speaker 3>So I try to practice a lot on my own and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not even practicing those songs.</v>

759
00:34:01.101 --> 00:34:03.680
<v Speaker 3>Just kind of just drill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

760
00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:08.150
<v Speaker 3>like Sam Kinison used to have a joke</v>
<v Speaker 3>about the beach boys about,</v>

761
00:34:08.151 --> 00:34:08.500
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

762
00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:12.320
<v Speaker 3>they're going out there playing a wish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They could all be California girls</v>

763
00:34:12.350 --> 00:34:14.490
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Jesus fucking Christ.</v>

764
00:34:14.740 --> 00:34:18.620
<v Speaker 3>Whereas like it becomes a job that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't want,</v>

765
00:34:18.621 --> 00:34:22.010
<v Speaker 3>that you want it to be fresh and</v>
<v Speaker 3>exciting and you want it to be something</v>

766
00:34:22.011 --> 00:34:23.750
<v Speaker 3>that you're really in the moment and</v>
<v Speaker 3>really thinking about.</v>

767
00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:27.590
<v Speaker 3>So I make up new shit on the spot too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the best is I just make up new</v>

768
00:34:27.591 --> 00:34:32.090
<v Speaker 3>fills or just try to reinvent the songs</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the point where even like Marco</v>

769
00:34:32.091 --> 00:34:34.380
<v Speaker 3>looked back at me and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

770
00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:36.320
<v Speaker 3>like that's the best,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

771
00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:41.090
<v Speaker 3>just kind of freaking it on the fly and</v>
<v Speaker 3>even to the crowd it's like,</v>

772
00:34:41.091 --> 00:34:42.380
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's cool.</v>

773
00:34:42.381 --> 00:34:46.400
<v Speaker 3>You haven't heard that before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's like after two or three months</v>

774
00:34:46.401 --> 00:34:47.840
<v Speaker 3>of being on tour,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do stuff like that.</v>

775
00:34:48.470 --> 00:34:50.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you get off tour,</v>

776
00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:55.550
<v Speaker 3>do you consciously give yourself arrest?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

777
00:34:55.610 --> 00:34:58.040
<v Speaker 3>I'm busier at home than I am on tour on</v>
<v Speaker 3>tour.</v>

778
00:34:58.041 --> 00:35:01.820
<v Speaker 3>So lavish man like you have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have someone saying,</v>

779
00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:06.800
<v Speaker 3>I mean you do have people kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>waiting on you hand and foot somewhat,</v>

780
00:35:06.830 --> 00:35:07.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a catering,</v>

781
00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:11.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ready if you want to eat or hey you got</v>

782
00:35:11.141 --> 00:35:14.080

<v Speaker 3>you go onstage,</v>

783
00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:16.460
<v Speaker 3>a cars outside waiting for you after the</v>
<v Speaker 3>show,</v>

785
00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:22.900

<v Speaker 3>home I do so many other things besides</v>

786
00:35:22.971 --> 00:35:25.820
<v Speaker 3>playing the band.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I produced a bunch of rap artists.</v>

<v Speaker 3>a bunch of different artists.</v>

816
00:36:36.810 --> 00:36:39.720
<v Speaker 4>Do you like sap because it's a different</v>
<v Speaker 4>genre,</v>

817
00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:42.780
<v Speaker 4>helps you mix it up a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're just a big rap fan is why</v>

818
00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:44.010
<v Speaker 4>obviously you're wearing an ice cube.</v>

819
00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:44.901
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

820
00:36:44.901 --> 00:36:47.440
<v Speaker 3>I grew up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually listened to rap music before.</v>

821
00:36:47.441 --> 00:36:52.441
<v Speaker 3>This isn't any kind of music at all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like beastie boys and run DMC and public</v>

822
00:36:52.701 --> 00:36:56.270
<v Speaker 3>enemy in the far side and Krs one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I grew up on.</v>

823
00:36:56.720 --> 00:37:01.190
<v Speaker 3>And then I discovered I loved metal too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd love to slayer and king diamond and</v>

824
00:37:01.191 --> 00:37:05.690
<v Speaker 3>then then I discovered a band called</v>
<v Speaker 3>minor threat and the descendants and</v>

825
00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:08.690
<v Speaker 3>black flag and bad brains and I just</v>
<v Speaker 3>liked it all.</v>

826
00:37:08.691 --> 00:37:12.080
<v Speaker 3>And then my dad listened to jazz music</v>
<v Speaker 3>and country rebel music,</v>

827
00:37:12.081 --> 00:37:15.130
<v Speaker 3>so I was born in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>raised on like Johnny Cash and buckles</v>

828
00:37:15.290 --> 00:37:20.290
<v Speaker 3>and everything so and I kinda learned to</v>
<v Speaker 3>love it all and I had people around me</v>

829
00:37:21.291 --> 00:37:24.050
<v Speaker 3>when I was young when I was first</v>
<v Speaker 3>learning how to read music that just</v>

830
00:37:24.051 --> 00:37:27.600
<v Speaker 3>kept embedding in my head like you got</v>
<v Speaker 3>to listen to everything catches me,</v>

831
00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:31.190
<v Speaker 3>can just learn one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was actually taught how to play</v>

832
00:37:31.310 --> 00:37:35.780
<v Speaker 3>traditional jazz when I was really young</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I taught myself how to play</v>

833
00:37:35.781 --> 00:37:38.060
<v Speaker 3>everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking cool.</v>

834
00:37:38.090 --> 00:37:39.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's always loved everything.</v>

835
00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:40.470
<v Speaker 3>That's nice.</v>

836
00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:42.810
<v Speaker 4>You have an appreciation for all those</v>
<v Speaker 4>different genres too.</v>

837
00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:46.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'd be like if all you did was UFC</v>

838
00:37:46.661 --> 00:37:47.620
<v Speaker 3>commentating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd be like,</v>

839
00:37:48.030 --> 00:37:51.340
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this must be so much fun for you</v>

840
00:37:51.341 --> 00:37:53.290
<v Speaker 3>and all of your other endeavors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like same thing,</v>

841
00:37:53.291 --> 00:37:56.020
<v Speaker 3>like if I was only making,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

842
00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:59.320
<v Speaker 3>punk rock records or pop punk records or</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it was,</v>

843
00:37:59.321 --> 00:38:01.660
<v Speaker 3>I think I would go insane and it's been</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that for,</v>

844
00:38:02.170 --> 00:38:03.730
<v Speaker 3>for years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

845
00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:05.380
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think different people.</v>

846
00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:08.200
<v Speaker 4>I think some people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they're just doing like baseball</v>

847
00:38:08.201 --> 00:38:10.420
<v Speaker 4>commentary or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're fucking happy as shit.</v>

848
00:38:10.421 --> 00:38:12.310
<v Speaker 4>They love it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just want to do that.</v>

849
00:38:12.610 --> 00:38:16.300
<v Speaker 4>But there's some people like you or</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe like me that they need different</v>

850
00:38:16.301 --> 00:38:17.290
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

851
00:38:17.291 --> 00:38:18.160
<v Speaker 4>I will go crazy.</v>

852
00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:22.370
<v Speaker 3>I love like studio life is awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I did a Hans Zimmer thing and the</v>

853
00:38:22.371 --> 00:38:26.210
<v Speaker 3>other week and then the next day I'm in</v>
<v Speaker 3>with a band called nothing.</v>

854
00:38:26.211 --> 00:38:28.100
<v Speaker 3>Nowhere doing something completely</v>
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>

855

<v Speaker 3>This week I'm doing a little peep and</v>
<v Speaker 3>xxx remix it's,</v>

<v Speaker 3>really bored.</v>

857
00:38:35.330 --> 00:38:38.340
<v Speaker 3>I just don't feel creative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so kind of like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>How does that work?</v>

860
00:38:41.250 --> 00:38:43.320
<v Speaker 4>Like you get a phone call or someone</v>
<v Speaker 4>texts you,</v>

<v Speaker 3>three,</v>

867
00:38:55.381 --> 00:39:00.381
<v Speaker 3>three that I produce and write with and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just got nominated for a grammy</v>

869
00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:06.900

<v Speaker 3>Jason and we started literally a year</v>

<v Speaker 3>So like stuff like that,</v>

872
00:39:14.941 --> 00:39:18.180
<v Speaker 3>like kind of being an architecture</v>
<v Speaker 3>without building buildings,</v>

873
00:39:18.510 --> 00:39:21.660
<v Speaker 3>being architecture and music or whatever</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>

874
00:39:21.661 --> 00:39:25.860
<v Speaker 3>Whatever it is you're passionate about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That excites me is building sounds like</v>

875
00:39:25.861 --> 00:39:26.640
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing</v>

876
00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:29.560
<v Speaker 4>and working with different genres to has</v>
<v Speaker 4>got to be exciting too because you can</v>

877
00:39:29.561 --> 00:39:32.170
<v Speaker 4>mix it up and yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

879
00:39:34.451 --> 00:39:35.740
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do use,</v>

<v Speaker 4>good Lord,</v>

923
00:41:31.971 --> 00:41:34.070
<v Speaker 4>that audience must be beaten a coma.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh</v>

924
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:36.020
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then the headliners on who they are</v>

925
00:41:36.021 --> 00:41:38.300
<v Speaker 3>really there to see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that,</v>

926
00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:43.120
<v Speaker 3>that was a big accomplishment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just being able to play in that genre of</v>

927
00:41:43.121 --> 00:41:47.050
<v Speaker 3>music because I listened to it as a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's never really been a home for</v>

928
00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:50.190
<v Speaker 3>live drummer in a wrap scenario right</v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

929
00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:53.210
<v Speaker 3>So from the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

930
00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:57.050
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know what year it was when</v>
<v Speaker 3>puff call me when I had just joined</v>

931
00:41:57.051 --> 00:41:57.681
<v Speaker 3>blinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

932
00:41:57.681 --> 00:41:59.660
<v Speaker 3>y'all want you to be in this video?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

933
00:41:59.661 --> 00:42:00.530
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

934
00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:02.990
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I've pretty much was.</v>

935
00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:03.971
<v Speaker 3>I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

936
00:42:03.971 --> 00:42:04.671
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in,</v>

937
00:42:04.671 --> 00:42:07.820
<v Speaker 3>what are the biggest bands in the world?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm so stoked.</v>

938
00:42:07.821 --> 00:42:11.000
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't ask for anything more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I always want to go.</v>

939
00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:14.570
<v Speaker 3>I always wanted to get something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That tour was so fun.</v>

940
00:42:15.290 --> 00:42:17.390
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once puff asked me to be in a video is</v>

941
00:42:17.391 --> 00:42:21.080
<v Speaker 3>kind of like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just snowballed from there.</v>

942
00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:22.940
<v Speaker 3>You just got into that world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

943
00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:25.790
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had no idea why he wanted me,</v>

944
00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:27.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was just like,</v>

945
00:42:27.051 --> 00:42:28.460
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is so cool.</v>

946
00:42:28.461 --> 00:42:32.090
<v Speaker 3>Because I grew up on Biggie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I loved all that genre of music,</v>

947
00:42:32.091 --> 00:42:34.430
<v Speaker 3>but I was okay with just staying in my</v>
<v Speaker 3>lane as well,</v>

948
00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:39.820
<v Speaker 3>but when I got accepted with open arms</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was invited to do like bet awards</v>

949
00:42:39.831 --> 00:42:43.970
<v Speaker 3>with Tbi or Tiger Wayne and it was just</v>
<v Speaker 3>insane,</v>

950
00:42:43.971 --> 00:42:44.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>playing the grammy's.</v>

951
00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:47.510
<v Speaker 3>The funny thing is I've never played.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The grammy's will blink,</v>

952
00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:51.710
<v Speaker 3>but I played the grammys with black pit</v>
<v Speaker 3>bull drake.</v>

953
00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:53.090
<v Speaker 3>Eminem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

954
00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:55.010
<v Speaker 3>it's so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so weird to me.</v>

955
00:42:55.011 --> 00:42:58.820
<v Speaker 3>I just feel it's a trip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The opportunities I've had outside of</v>

956
00:42:58.821 --> 00:43:02.810
<v Speaker 3>rock music has been such blessings to</v>
<v Speaker 3>you when you say all those things and</v>

957
00:43:02.811 --> 00:43:05.120
<v Speaker 3>you know that you did all these things</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it almost seems like you're living in</v>

958
00:43:05.121 --> 00:43:05.810
<v Speaker 3>a dream.</v>

959
00:43:05.810 --> 00:43:07.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like smacking myself.</v>

960
00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:09.410
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't feel real when people go</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

961
00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:10.700
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who would you like to collaborate with?</v>

962
00:43:11.690 --> 00:43:16.460
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I'm so spoiled and I've been</v>
<v Speaker 3>so blessed to play with all these</v>

963
00:43:16.461 --> 00:43:18.650
<v Speaker 3>musicians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love that.</v>

<v Speaker 3>times.</v>

983
00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:56.120

<v Speaker 3>Because he,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

<v Speaker 3>and he would come down and train because</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would train with this one guy josh</v>

989
00:44:08.301 --> 00:44:10.960
<v Speaker 3>over here in Woodland Hills and he said,</v>

991
00:44:12.391 --> 00:44:12.891
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

992
00:44:12.891 --> 00:44:15.620
<v Speaker 3>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Little did I know it'd be dom tossing me</v>

993
00:44:15.621 --> 00:44:18.680
<v Speaker 3>around and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my gosh,</v>

994
00:44:18.681 --> 00:44:20.420
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was so difficult,</v>

995
00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:23.270
<v Speaker 3>but you roll with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well now it'd be.</v>

996
00:44:23.271 --> 00:44:24.560
<v Speaker 3>He'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>try to sleep me.</v>

997
00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:26.540
<v Speaker 3>I try to knock me out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jay,</v>

998
00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:30.380
<v Speaker 3>so I'm giving my all and just using his</v>
<v Speaker 3>defense and you know,</v>

999
00:44:30.381 --> 00:44:31.980
<v Speaker 3>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you actually swinging</v>

1000
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:34.830
<v Speaker 2>in the air and you're not landing it</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually more tiresome new when you're</v>

1001
00:44:34.850 --> 00:44:37.380
<v Speaker 2>hitting somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm swinging in the air,</v>

1002
00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:39.860
<v Speaker 2>he's like on the side of me all of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>sudden like,</v>

1003
00:44:39.861 --> 00:44:42.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's so quick like footwork and then I'm</v>

1004
00:44:42.721 --> 00:44:46.370
<v Speaker 2>wrestled to the ground and it's just a</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrap every time and he's so,</v>

1005
00:44:46.730 --> 00:44:48.410
<v Speaker 2>so talented.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yes,</v>

1006
00:44:48.810 --> 00:44:50.470
<v Speaker 2>I love that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1007
00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:52.350
<v Speaker 2>He just has the most ridiculous</v>
<v Speaker 2>footwork.</v>

1008
00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:55.950
<v Speaker 2>His footwork is so unique to him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to everything he does.</v>

1009
00:44:55.951 --> 00:44:57.840
<v Speaker 2>He's got like this weird herky jerky</v>
<v Speaker 2>little.</v>

1010
00:44:57.850 --> 00:44:59.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he does.</v>

1011
00:44:59.011 --> 00:45:01.830
<v Speaker 2>He's probably one of the most unique mma</v>
<v Speaker 2>fighters ever.</v>

1012
00:45:02.070 --> 00:45:06.100
<v Speaker 2>I feel like a lot of people have kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>borrowed from his style for sure.</v>

1013
00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:07.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

1014
00:45:07.291 --> 00:45:08.700
<v Speaker 2>Not to say they didn't make it their</v>
<v Speaker 2>own,</v>

1015
00:45:08.701 --> 00:45:10.670
<v Speaker 2>but I feel like dom was the first one</v>
<v Speaker 2>you saw,</v>

1016
00:45:11.250 --> 00:45:12.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of move.</v>

1017
00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:13.290
<v Speaker 2>Unquestionably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1018
00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:16.080
<v Speaker 2>And that's because of his intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he doesn't like getting hit.</v>

1019
00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:17.071
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1020
00:45:17.071 --> 00:45:18.840
<v Speaker 2>I gotta figure out a way to not get hit</v>
<v Speaker 2>so much.</v>

1021
00:45:18.841 --> 00:45:20.340
<v Speaker 2>Like what's the best way to knock it</v>
<v Speaker 2>hit.</v>

1022
00:45:20.610 --> 00:45:24.180
<v Speaker 2>And it just just came up with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very unorthodox way of moving.</v>

1023
00:45:24.390 --> 00:45:27.600
<v Speaker 2>He's a real encyclopedia of information</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you start talking to them about</v>

1024
00:45:27.601 --> 00:45:29.520
<v Speaker 2>fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he's a really enjoyed doing</v>

1025
00:45:29.521 --> 00:45:32.730
<v Speaker 2>commentary with him because he's so</v>
<v Speaker 2>insightful.</v>

1026
00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:36.570
<v Speaker 2>He's so good at pointing out little</v>
<v Speaker 2>areas where he thinks people are making</v>

1027
00:45:36.571 --> 00:45:39.990
<v Speaker 2>mistakes or how to capitalize on certain</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that people are doing.</v>

1028
00:45:40.170 --> 00:45:41.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've watched fights with him before and</v>

1029
00:45:41.851 --> 00:45:43.120
<v Speaker 2>he's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he,</v>

1030
00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:45.360
<v Speaker 2>he gives a different insight than what</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm seeing.</v>

1031
00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:46.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1032
00:45:46.370 --> 00:45:47.040
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1033
00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:49.290
<v Speaker 2>he's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially when it comes to wrestling</v>

1034
00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:54.320
<v Speaker 2>clinch work and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and even like weird striking techniques.</v>

1035
00:45:54.361 --> 00:45:58.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's so good at befuddling people that</v>

1036
00:45:58.291 --> 00:46:02.370
<v Speaker 2>he fights with with movement and</v>
<v Speaker 2>information like he's given them looks</v>

1037
00:46:02.371 --> 00:46:02.910
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're,</v>

1038
00:46:02.910 --> 00:46:04.800
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to set up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1039
00:46:04.810 --> 00:46:07.200
<v Speaker 2>they're standing there trying to set up</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they don't know what the fuck he's</v>

1040
00:46:07.201 --> 00:46:07.470
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

1041
00:46:07.470 --> 00:46:09.600
<v Speaker 2>Then they have to reset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they try and again,</v>

1042
00:46:09.630 --> 00:46:13.080
<v Speaker 2>then he's given them a different look</v>
<v Speaker 2>and standing over here and then he's in</v>

1043
00:46:13.081 --> 00:46:14.880
<v Speaker 2>front of with his hands down and he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>

1044
00:46:14.881 --> 00:46:16.360
<v Speaker 2>And Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1045
00:46:16.430 --> 00:46:18.020
<v Speaker 2>That's a trip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's great.</v>

1046
00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:20.820
<v Speaker 2>Just fucked up his shoulder again man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know man.</v>

1047
00:46:20.821 --> 00:46:22.860
<v Speaker 2>I think he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he trained so much.</v>

1048
00:46:22.890 --> 00:46:23.970
<v Speaker 2>I feel like he just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1049
00:46:24.130 --> 00:46:25.770
<v Speaker 2>he's a snap session.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1050
00:46:25.771 --> 00:46:27.600
<v Speaker 2>he's a savage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he,</v>

1051
00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:32.280
<v Speaker 2>he got back from knee surgery and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>went so hard that he gave himself</v>

1052
00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:35.700
<v Speaker 2>plantar fasciitis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say fucked up the bottom of his feet</v>

1053
00:46:35.701 --> 00:46:39.300
<v Speaker 2>from running and sprinting and doing all</v>
<v Speaker 2>kinds of crazy shit to get in shape.</v>

1054
00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:42.960
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got over that and I mean he's had so</v>

1055
00:46:42.961 --> 00:46:44.730
<v Speaker 2>many different surgeries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nice.</v>

1056
00:46:44.731 --> 00:46:45.930
<v Speaker 2>Are miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you had that?</v>

1057
00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:47.190
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never had planner.</v>

1058
00:46:47.250 --> 00:46:49.290
<v Speaker 2>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had it on a tour where I would,</v>

1059
00:46:49.790 --> 00:46:50.623
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd get these.</v>

1060
00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:53.670
<v Speaker 2>I get these weird kind of things where I</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to do a certain thing before I go</v>

1061
00:46:53.671 --> 00:46:56.220
<v Speaker 2>on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things I did on a tour</v>

1062
00:46:56.221 --> 00:46:57.250
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1063
00:46:57.251 --> 00:47:00.690
<v Speaker 2>it was about a four month tour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is run four to five miles before the</v>

1064
00:47:00.691 --> 00:47:04.050
<v Speaker 2>show and by the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the middle of that tour I had</v>

1065
00:47:04.051 --> 00:47:06.450
<v Speaker 2>actually given myself a stress fracture</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my foot.</v>

1066
00:47:06.980 --> 00:47:09.630
<v Speaker 2>It was terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you run on concrete?</v>

1067
00:47:09.810 --> 00:47:11.500
<v Speaker 2>Not a treadmill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

1068
00:47:11.610 --> 00:47:12.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1069
00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:14.010
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well sometimes.</v>

1070
00:47:14.250 --> 00:47:16.290
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when there was no treadmill,</v>

1071
00:47:16.291 --> 00:47:19.380
<v Speaker 2>I'd just run out in the street,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I kind of get like that where I just</v>

1072
00:47:19.381 --> 00:47:20.700
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1073
00:47:20.730 --> 00:47:22.670
<v Speaker 2>I get obsessive about stuff and I want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1074
00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:26.100
<v Speaker 2>I want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get to kind of throw myself all the</v>

1075
00:47:26.101 --> 00:47:28.440
<v Speaker 2>way in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what kind of running shoes do you</v>

1076
00:47:28.441 --> 00:47:30.130
<v Speaker 2>run?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you run with house</v>

1077
00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:31.060
<v Speaker 3>running?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like honestly,</v>

1078
00:47:31.061 --> 00:47:34.390
<v Speaker 3>on that tour sometimes I'd running vans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is probably half of my problem,</v>

1079
00:47:34.391 --> 00:47:36.040
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'd be so quick like,</v>

1080
00:47:36.070 --> 00:47:39.550
<v Speaker 3>oh I have an hour here to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

1081
00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:42.760
<v Speaker 3>that wasn't fun though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was painful.</v>

1082
00:47:43.010 --> 00:47:45.020
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you have overused injuries,</v>

1083
00:47:45.021 --> 00:47:46.910
<v Speaker 4>those are some of the hardest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Especially your feet.</v>

1084
00:47:46.940 --> 00:47:49.310
<v Speaker 4>There's some of the hardest to recover</v>
<v Speaker 4>from because you have to walk.</v>

1085
00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:52.720
<v Speaker 4>It's not like if you hurt your elbow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could just not use it for a while</v>

1086
00:47:53.130 --> 00:47:56.420
<v Speaker 4>and it will eventually heal up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you need to use your feet.</v>

1087
00:47:57.200 --> 00:47:58.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Planners,</v>

1088
00:47:58.130 --> 00:47:58.940
<v Speaker 4>a rough one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1089
00:47:58.940 --> 00:48:00.380
<v Speaker 4>I know a lot of people that have got</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1090
00:48:00.410 --> 00:48:03.750
<v Speaker 4>I've been very lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I came from a martial arts background,</v>

1091
00:48:03.751 --> 00:48:07.040
<v Speaker 4>a lot of kicking and stuff like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so my feet are pretty strong from</v>

1092
00:48:07.041 --> 00:48:10.040
<v Speaker 4>moving,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I found that a running with minimal</v>

1093
00:48:10.041 --> 00:48:12.860
<v Speaker 4>issues on hills that that made him even</v>
<v Speaker 4>stronger.</v>

1094
00:48:12.890 --> 00:48:13.890
<v Speaker 4>Yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yoga,</v>

1095
00:48:14.170 --> 00:48:15.130
<v Speaker 4>stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what?</v>

1096
00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:17.560
<v Speaker 4>Those weird kind of a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do they call vibram?</v>

1097
00:48:17.561 --> 00:48:20.330
<v Speaker 4>Five finger shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wear those and where there's another</v>

1098
00:48:20.331 --> 00:48:22.640
<v Speaker 4>company called Vivo barefoot or wear</v>
<v Speaker 4>those.</v>

1099
00:48:23.060 --> 00:48:25.970
<v Speaker 4>I like those a little bit better for</v>
<v Speaker 4>running on the hills because I'm running</v>

1100
00:48:25.971 --> 00:48:28.800
<v Speaker 4>on a lot of rocks and shit and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>vibrams they.</v>

1101
00:48:28.820 --> 00:48:30.710
<v Speaker 4>They would be great if everything was</v>
<v Speaker 4>soft dirt,</v>

1102
00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:34.520
<v Speaker 4>but I'm running on weird jagged rocks</v>
<v Speaker 4>and shit and it just.</v>

1103
00:48:34.650 --> 00:48:36.650
<v Speaker 4>It hurts your feet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got to be real careful where you</v>

1104
00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:37.780
<v Speaker 4>place your feet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1105
00:48:38.270 --> 00:48:43.130
<v Speaker 4>but it just forces your feet to work as</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're supposed to as opposed to like a</v>

1106
00:48:43.131 --> 00:48:45.990
<v Speaker 4>big cushiony running shoe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1107
00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:50.090
<v Speaker 4>like cushiony running shoe feels good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It feels good to run on it because you</v>

1108
00:48:50.091 --> 00:48:52.070
<v Speaker 4>get all this cushion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not so jarring,</v>

1109
00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:55.220
<v Speaker 4>but your body really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really should run.</v>

1110
00:48:55.310 --> 00:48:57.500
<v Speaker 4>I think personally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unless you're a runner,</v>

1111
00:48:57.680 --> 00:49:02.450
<v Speaker 4>he should probably run less with a</v>
<v Speaker 4>minimal issue then you should run</v>

1112
00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:05.210
<v Speaker 4>because it's more comfortable to run</v>
<v Speaker 4>with the big fat cushion.</v>

1113
00:49:05.450 --> 00:49:09.200
<v Speaker 4>I think you ultimately give yourself</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably more injuries that way.</v>

1114
00:49:09.330 --> 00:49:11.150
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can get injuries from those</v>

1115
00:49:11.180 --> 00:49:15.050
<v Speaker 4>minimal issues too if you don't pay</v>
<v Speaker 4>close attention.</v>

1116
00:49:15.051 --> 00:49:16.490
<v Speaker 4>He tried too hard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>too quick.</v>

1117
00:49:17.010 --> 00:49:18.350
<v Speaker 4>Your foot's not conditioned for it.</v>

1118
00:49:18.450 --> 00:49:19.720
<v Speaker 3>My feet are terrible too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1119
00:49:19.740 --> 00:49:21.780
<v Speaker 3>I had what was called a lis franc</v>
<v Speaker 3>fracture.</v>

1120
00:49:22.020 --> 00:49:24.010
<v Speaker 3>What have you heard of that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's basically your,</v>

1121
00:49:24.011 --> 00:49:26.100
<v Speaker 3>your foot breaks in half,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like all your,</v>

1122
00:49:26.430 --> 00:49:28.950
<v Speaker 3>all your tendons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your ligaments and your bones.</v>

1123
00:49:29.730 --> 00:49:33.060
<v Speaker 3>How the fuck did you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was high as a kite and it was in</v>

1124
00:49:33.061 --> 00:49:37.290
<v Speaker 3>Australia and I was running to the bus</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I had like two huge bags that were</v>

1125
00:49:37.291 --> 00:49:39.150
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably like I probably had 40 pounds</v>

1126
00:49:39.151 --> 00:49:42.810
<v Speaker 3>on my back and I was just trying to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the bus to get to the next show or</v>

1127
00:49:42.811 --> 00:49:46.050
<v Speaker 3>whatever and it was the stupidest thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever,</v>

1128
00:49:46.051 --> 00:49:47.250
<v Speaker 3>but it was a little like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1129
00:49:47.251 --> 00:49:50.640
<v Speaker 3>the little cracks in the sidewalk where</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's up higher and I didn't see and I</v>

1130
00:49:50.641 --> 00:49:55.410
<v Speaker 3>fell with all that weight on me and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the bus and I'm starting to think,</v>

1131
00:49:55.411 --> 00:49:57.270
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is really bad in my tour managers.</v>

1132
00:49:57.270 --> 00:49:59.580
<v Speaker 3>Like Amen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just get the blood flow and try walking</v>

1133
00:49:59.581 --> 00:50:03.360
<v Speaker 3>on it and I'm trying to just suck it up</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm walking in the airport.</v>

1134
00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:05.580
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost like tearing,</v>

1135
00:50:05.581 --> 00:50:08.370
<v Speaker 3>like I'm fucking hurting so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1136
00:50:08.371 --> 00:50:11.490
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I need to get an x ray or like</v>

1137
00:50:11.491 --> 00:50:12.840
<v Speaker 3>an MRI.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This isn't good.</v>

1138
00:50:13.170 --> 00:50:15.960
<v Speaker 3>So I play like the next two shows with</v>
<v Speaker 3>my other foot.</v>

1139
00:50:16.620 --> 00:50:19.890
<v Speaker 3>I get an x ray.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They said I've broken my foot and half I</v>

1140
00:50:19.891 --> 00:50:22.080
<v Speaker 3>need surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>

1141
00:50:22.081 --> 00:50:24.300
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I ended up doing a couple of</v>

1142
00:50:24.301 --> 00:50:26.250
<v Speaker 3>weeks of the tour,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I shouldn't have,</v>

1143
00:50:26.251 --> 00:50:29.450
<v Speaker 3>I should have gone and that surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I played it with my other foot and</v>

1144
00:50:29.451 --> 00:50:32.330
<v Speaker 3>then I got home,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did the surgery and I was like six</v>

1145
00:50:32.331 --> 00:50:36.710
<v Speaker 3>months on crutches and just recovering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was terrible.</v>

1146
00:50:36.711 --> 00:50:40.960
<v Speaker 3>Six months on crutches and then I feel</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I wasn't feeling that great because</v>

1147
00:50:40.970 --> 00:50:43.880
<v Speaker 3>I was taking so many painkillers and</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

1148
00:50:43.881 --> 00:50:47.180
<v Speaker 3>It was slowing down the process,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I don't know if you've heard of,</v>

1149
00:50:47.181 --> 00:50:50.840
<v Speaker 3>but that it really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like my bones became super brittle from</v>

1150
00:50:50.841 --> 00:50:53.090
<v Speaker 3>pink from painkillers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>painkillers,</v>

1151
00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:55.280
<v Speaker 3>norcos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1152
00:50:55.370 --> 00:50:58.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1153
00:50:58.910 --> 00:51:01.490
<v Speaker 3>But I would imagine the pain must've</v>
<v Speaker 3>been fucking excruciating.</v>

1154
00:51:02.030 --> 00:51:03.560
<v Speaker 3>Snapping your foot and half.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1155
00:51:03.561 --> 00:51:05.690
<v Speaker 3>it was so painful when it first</v>
<v Speaker 3>happened.</v>

1156
00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:09.410
<v Speaker 3>It's something else for pain medication</v>
<v Speaker 3>after you got off of that stuff and just</v>

1157
00:51:09.411 --> 00:51:10.520
<v Speaker 3>smoked weed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1158
00:51:10.550 --> 00:51:11.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that enough?</v>

1159
00:51:12.020 --> 00:51:13.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty good with pain.</v>

1160
00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:18.140
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't really bug me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What about edibles?</v>

1161
00:51:19.250 --> 00:51:21.320
<v Speaker 3>Haven't really done it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't fuck with edibles,</v>

1162
00:51:21.650 --> 00:51:25.670
<v Speaker 3>really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't had anything for 10 years.</v>

1163
00:51:25.730 --> 00:51:26.690
<v Speaker 3>Nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>

1164
00:51:26.780 --> 00:51:27.920
<v Speaker 3>Zero,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no alcohol,</v>

1165
00:51:27.950 --> 00:51:28.731
<v Speaker 3>no weed?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1166
00:51:28.731 --> 00:51:30.460
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Damn yeah,</v>

1167
00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:31.660
<v Speaker 3>10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was a big,</v>

1168
00:51:31.910 --> 00:51:35.210
<v Speaker 3>well after my accident as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was fed,</v>

1169
00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:38.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>four months in a hospital being fed</v>

1170
00:51:38.001 --> 00:51:42.500
<v Speaker 3>morphine every day for four months and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then being on all these bipolar meds and</v>

1171
00:51:42.501 --> 00:51:44.960
<v Speaker 3>everything else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I honestly didn't want to put anything</v>

1172
00:51:44.961 --> 00:51:47.510
<v Speaker 3>in my body when I got out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even take painkillers when I</v>

1173
00:51:47.511 --> 00:51:49.340
<v Speaker 3>got home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

1174
00:51:49.341 --> 00:51:52.060
<v Speaker 3>What kind of bipolar meds they put you</v>
<v Speaker 3>on to it?</v>

1175
00:51:52.100 --> 00:51:54.950
<v Speaker 3>I don't even remember.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was on like four or five.</v>

1176
00:51:54.951 --> 00:51:57.140
<v Speaker 3>Just bipolar and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I had like,</v>

1177
00:51:57.830 --> 00:52:00.680
<v Speaker 3>I had so many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I probably had like 12 medications I got</v>

1178
00:52:00.681 --> 00:52:04.370
<v Speaker 3>sent home with and I did it for about a</v>
<v Speaker 3>week or two and then I wouldn't see my</v>

1179
00:52:04.371 --> 00:52:05.120
<v Speaker 3>doctor.</v>

1180
00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:09.230
<v Speaker 3>I had actually overheard one of my</v>
<v Speaker 3>friends talking who was like a brother</v>

1181
00:52:09.231 --> 00:52:12.380
<v Speaker 3>to me and I had heard him talking to</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone else and he was like,</v>

1182
00:52:12.381 --> 00:52:15.380
<v Speaker 3>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like travis seems a little different,</v>

1183
00:52:15.620 --> 00:52:18.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems a little bit slow or something.</v>

1184
00:52:18.870 --> 00:52:20.510
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I had overheard him.</v>

1185
00:52:20.511 --> 00:52:23.840
<v Speaker 3>He didn't know I overheard him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was these meds.</v>

1186
00:52:23.841 --> 00:52:25.240
<v Speaker 3>I had been telling my doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1187
00:52:25.250 --> 00:52:26.690
<v Speaker 3>I just don't feel like me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel,</v>

1188
00:52:27.050 --> 00:52:29.420
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel weird and I just don't feel like</v>

1189
00:52:29.421 --> 00:52:31.880
<v Speaker 3>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I just flushed them down the toilet</v>

1190
00:52:31.881 --> 00:52:34.070
<v Speaker 3>one day and the next week I came back to</v>
<v Speaker 3>see him and he's like,</v>

1191
00:52:34.071 --> 00:52:34.791
<v Speaker 3>how are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

1192
00:52:34.791 --> 00:52:37.220
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm off all those meds you told me I'd</v>

1193
00:52:37.221 --> 00:52:39.860
<v Speaker 3>be on for the rest of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

1194
00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:41.900
<v Speaker 3>oh dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from what you've been through,</v>

1195
00:52:41.901 --> 00:52:44.330
<v Speaker 3>like you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's okay to be on something like that.</v>

1196
00:52:44.330 --> 00:52:45.260
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1197
00:52:45.710 --> 00:52:47.810
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing fine though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't need those,</v>

1198
00:52:47.811 --> 00:52:48.644
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

1199
00:52:48.690 --> 00:52:51.110
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to put you on a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of the plane crash.</v>

1200
00:52:51.170 --> 00:52:51.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They like,</v>

1201
00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:55.760
<v Speaker 3>don't shame yourself by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by giving yourself a hard time that you</v>

1202
00:52:55.761 --> 00:52:57.830
<v Speaker 3>have to take these pills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

1203
00:52:57.831 --> 00:52:58.730
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1204
00:52:58.731 --> 00:53:00.230
<v Speaker 3>I honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't feel like they're doing what</v>

1205
00:53:00.231 --> 00:53:03.590
<v Speaker 3>they're supposed to for me and actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>having a negative effect on me,</v>

1206
00:53:03.591 --> 00:53:05.210
<v Speaker 3>so I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really don't want to take them.</v>

1207
00:53:05.211 --> 00:53:07.460
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They also told me I'd never run again,</v>

1208
00:53:07.461 --> 00:53:09.080
<v Speaker 3>I'd never do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never do that again.</v>

1209
00:53:09.081 --> 00:53:11.330
<v Speaker 3>So I think I just got to the point where</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1210
00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:15.680
<v Speaker 3>let me see how many things I can prove</v>
<v Speaker 3>otherwise that they've told me,</v>

1211
00:53:16.010 --> 00:53:17.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once I stopped taking the pills,</v>

1212
00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:21.470
<v Speaker 3>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they put you on bipolar medication</v>

1213
00:53:21.471 --> 00:53:23.420
<v Speaker 3>because of a traumatic crash?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1214
00:53:23.540 --> 00:53:25.620
<v Speaker 3>that seems odd to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1215
00:53:25.621 --> 00:53:26.430
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a doctor</v>

1216
00:53:26.430 --> 00:53:27.390
<v Speaker 4>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but.</v>

1217
00:53:27.730 --> 00:53:29.770
<v Speaker 3>Well I was kinda crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1218
00:53:29.771 --> 00:53:33.310
<v Speaker 3>I was suicidal when I was in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>hospital.</v>

1219
00:53:33.430 --> 00:53:35.980
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was on so many drugs I couldn't even,</v>

1220
00:53:36.340 --> 00:53:37.990
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even know my friends had passed</v>
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>

1221
00:53:38.530 --> 00:53:41.440
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even know the two pilots had</v>
<v Speaker 3>passed away.</v>

1222
00:53:41.620 --> 00:53:44.800
<v Speaker 3>I didn't remember anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kept thinking like everyone was in the</v>

1223
00:53:44.801 --> 00:53:47.170
<v Speaker 3>hospital,</v>
<v Speaker 3>including the two pilots,</v>

1224
00:53:47.171 --> 00:53:51.370
<v Speaker 3>including my two best friends and am.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought everyone was just in different</v>

1225
00:53:51.371 --> 00:53:54.070
<v Speaker 3>rooms until about two weeks before I</v>
<v Speaker 3>left.</v>

1226
00:53:54.940 --> 00:53:59.940
<v Speaker 3>And then I went crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then it was like they had a 50 1:50</v>

1227
00:54:00.071 --> 00:54:01.180
<v Speaker 3>cases on their hands,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1228
00:54:01.181 --> 00:54:03.100
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't in a good place.</v>

1229
00:54:03.430 --> 00:54:04.870
<v Speaker 3>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then I did,</v>

1230
00:54:05.140 --> 00:54:09.610
<v Speaker 3>I did a lot of like posttraumatic like</v>
<v Speaker 3>therapy when I was in the hospital to</v>

1231
00:54:09.611 --> 00:54:11.620
<v Speaker 3>kind of like calm things down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1232
00:54:11.621 --> 00:54:15.340
<v Speaker 3>once I got through all my surgeries and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then yeah,</v>

1233
00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:17.140
<v Speaker 3>I mean over time it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was cool,</v>

1234
00:54:17.141 --> 00:54:20.290
<v Speaker 3>but it was never cool but I started to</v>
<v Speaker 3>feel better,</v>

1235
00:54:20.590 --> 00:54:22.130
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1236
00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:25.150
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was cause I was so crazy at</v>

1237
00:54:25.151 --> 00:54:26.610
<v Speaker 3>the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's,</v>

1238
00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:27.473
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting</v>

1239
00:54:27.580 --> 00:54:32.580
<v Speaker 4>that I would think that bipolar</v>
<v Speaker 4>medication would be something that you</v>

1240
00:54:32.581 --> 00:54:37.581
<v Speaker 4>would give someone who has like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a condition that just is sort of pre</v>

1241
00:54:39.060 --> 00:54:40.410
<v Speaker 4>predisposed to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1242
00:54:40.411 --> 00:54:44.220
<v Speaker 4>I don't know anything about bipolar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I would think that that's something</v>

1243
00:54:44.221 --> 00:54:47.790
<v Speaker 4>that you just have to have a mental</v>
<v Speaker 4>condition.</v>

1244
00:54:48.270 --> 00:54:50.730
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't think that it would be</v>
<v Speaker 4>something that they would give you to</v>

1245
00:54:50.731 --> 00:54:52.620
<v Speaker 4>overcome a traumatic incident.</v>

1246
00:54:53.170 --> 00:54:54.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they were afraid I was going to</v>

1247
00:54:54.881 --> 00:54:57.460
<v Speaker 3>be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had like a mental condition after</v>

1248
00:54:57.640 --> 00:54:58.690
<v Speaker 3>everything happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1249
00:54:58.830 --> 00:55:01.590
<v Speaker 4>they think like maybe because you're an</v>
<v Speaker 4>artist that you're probably a little</v>

1250
00:55:01.591 --> 00:55:02.424
<v Speaker 4>crazy anyway.</v>

1251
00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:03.770
<v Speaker 3>Possibly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1252
00:55:03.790 --> 00:55:06.290
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I was a mess too.</v>

1253
00:55:06.291 --> 00:55:06.741
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1254
00:55:06.741 --> 00:55:09.650
<v Speaker 3>like I had done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd smoke so much weed,</v>

1255
00:55:09.710 --> 00:55:12.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every day and I'd taken so many pills</v>

1256
00:55:12.321 --> 00:55:17.321
<v Speaker 3>and I would self medicate quite a bit</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I woke up probably out of 11 and my</v>

1257
00:55:17.511 --> 00:55:22.511
<v Speaker 3>30 surgeries I had in the burn center,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I woke up swinging on doctors so I would</v>

1258
00:55:23.781 --> 00:55:27.080
<v Speaker 3>wake up and I would just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be opened up and I would just go</v>

1259
00:55:27.081 --> 00:55:28.880
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

1260
00:55:28.881 --> 00:55:30.580
<v Speaker 3>So trying to get off the table.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1261
00:55:30.581 --> 00:55:33.320
<v Speaker 3>we would just try to get off the table.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even think I really knew what</v>

1262
00:55:33.321 --> 00:55:35.660
<v Speaker 3>was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just wasn't,</v>

1263
00:55:35.690 --> 00:55:38.720
<v Speaker 3>they couldn't give me enough medication</v>
<v Speaker 3>and knocked me out because I had been</v>

1264
00:55:38.721 --> 00:55:42.680
<v Speaker 3>self medicating for so long and abusing</v>
<v Speaker 3>meds for so long.</v>

1265
00:55:42.740 --> 00:55:45.530
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you would get up from anesthesia,</v>

1266
00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:47.720
<v Speaker 3>you would just wake up in the middle of</v>
<v Speaker 3>anesthesia.</v>

1267
00:55:49.940 --> 00:55:52.640
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was crying.</v>

1268
00:55:52.670 --> 00:55:54.890
<v Speaker 3>That was a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1269
00:55:54.970 --> 00:55:57.680
<v Speaker 3>how did you clean up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1270
00:55:57.800 --> 00:56:01.600
<v Speaker 3>I think after,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the last time I swung under a</v>

1271
00:56:01.601 --> 00:56:02.810
<v Speaker 3>doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were kinda like,</v>

1272
00:56:03.290 --> 00:56:04.190
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to,</v>

1273
00:56:04.250 --> 00:56:06.860
<v Speaker 3>you can't be here no more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I was like,</v>

1274
00:56:06.950 --> 00:56:10.010
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I need x amount of more surgeries</v>

1275
00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:13.280
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really was just in fighting demons,</v>

1276
00:56:13.281 --> 00:56:16.040
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just figured out like my two best</v>

1277
00:56:16.041 --> 00:56:19.730
<v Speaker 3>friends had passed away and the pilots</v>
<v Speaker 3>had passed away and I was just like in</v>

1278
00:56:19.731 --> 00:56:21.800
<v Speaker 3>an ugly place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

1279
00:56:21.820 --> 00:56:22.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

1280
00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:26.830
<v Speaker 3>my kids couldn't visit me because 65</v>
<v Speaker 3>percent of my body was burnt so I</v>

1281
00:56:26.831 --> 00:56:29.410
<v Speaker 3>couldn't be around people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was just in it man.</v>

1282
00:56:29.411 --> 00:56:30.244
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1283
00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:31.720
<v Speaker 3>and then I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

1284
00:56:31.721 --> 00:56:36.721
<v Speaker 3>I turned a corner and then I was like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>team player and I don't think I was on</v>

1285
00:56:36.881 --> 00:56:40.060
<v Speaker 3>as many meds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of my surgeries were over and just</v>

1286
00:56:40.090 --> 00:56:42.460
<v Speaker 3>learning how to walk again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1287
00:56:42.910 --> 00:56:45.100
<v Speaker 3>being able to take a shower by myself</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

1288
00:56:45.130 --> 00:56:46.030
<v Speaker 3>all that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1289
00:56:46.031 --> 00:56:49.300
<v Speaker 3>I think that was just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are the good points that helped me</v>

1290
00:56:49.301 --> 00:56:51.550
<v Speaker 3>turn the corner and I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just had more strength,</v>

1291
00:56:51.551 --> 00:56:52.240
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1292
00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:54.310
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So wow.</v>

1293
00:56:54.370 --> 00:56:58.790
<v Speaker 4>So you just just turned a corner in your</v>
<v Speaker 4>mind and just sort of accepted it and.</v>

1294
00:56:58.950 --> 00:57:00.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same with drugs,</v>

1295
00:57:00.451 --> 00:57:04.620
<v Speaker 3>like I didn't ever do rehab or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was mainly my kids and just a</v>

1296
00:57:05.250 --> 00:57:07.890
<v Speaker 3>second life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a second chance at life was enough for</v>

1297
00:57:07.891 --> 00:57:08.724
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1298
00:57:08.860 --> 00:57:10.590
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never want to do any of that stuff</v>

1299
00:57:10.591 --> 00:57:11.424
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1300
00:57:11.490 --> 00:57:14.070
<v Speaker 4>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So once you get a certain amount of</v>

1301
00:57:14.071 --> 00:57:19.071
<v Speaker 4>distance between you and those days,</v>
<v Speaker 4>does it seem like it wasn't even real?</v>

1302
00:57:19.480 --> 00:57:21.060
<v Speaker 4>That's wasn't you doing those things?</v>

1303

<v Speaker 3>it again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you realize nom I'm all good.</v>

1341
00:58:48.150 --> 00:58:50.400
<v Speaker 3>I used to have dreams like that where I</v>
<v Speaker 3>had to go back to high school.</v>

1342
00:58:50.490 --> 00:58:52.710
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to have dreams for years.</v>

1343
00:58:52.711 --> 00:58:53.970
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you hate high school</v>

1344
00:58:55.690 --> 00:58:57.900
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think anyone likes it unless</v>

1345
00:58:57.910 --> 00:58:59.670
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1346
00:58:59.671 --> 00:59:01.820
<v Speaker 3>soon to be a professor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking doctors.</v>

1347
00:59:02.240 --> 00:59:05.780
<v Speaker 4>Well I just had no idea what I wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 4>do for a living and I was just like,</v>

1348
00:59:06.380 --> 00:59:10.490
<v Speaker 4>being trapped in a classroom constantly</v>
<v Speaker 4>was excruciating.</v>

1349
00:59:11.060 --> 00:59:14.270
<v Speaker 4>I must have had.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I probably do have some crazy</v>

1350
00:59:14.271 --> 00:59:15.620
<v Speaker 4>form of add.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1351
00:59:15.621 --> 00:59:17.630
<v Speaker 4>I've never been diagnosed that been to a</v>
<v Speaker 4>shrink.</v>

1352
00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:20.300
<v Speaker 4>But if I did I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'm sure they'd probably try to</v>

1353
00:59:20.301 --> 00:59:24.320
<v Speaker 4>put me on if I tried to tell them what's</v>
<v Speaker 4>going on in my head all the time,</v>

1354
00:59:24.321 --> 00:59:25.011
<v Speaker 4>they'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus,</v>

1355
00:59:25.011 --> 00:59:25.760
<v Speaker 4>sit down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hold on.</v>

1356
00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:28.610
<v Speaker 4>I take these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>take these.</v>

1357
00:59:28.611 --> 00:59:31.280
<v Speaker 4>Whatever you do is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when I was in high school,</v>

1358
00:59:31.281 --> 00:59:35.270
<v Speaker 4>I fucking hated it and I barely got by.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then when I got out of high school,</v>

1359
00:59:35.271 --> 00:59:39.030
<v Speaker 4>I would have these dreams where I'd wake</v>
<v Speaker 4>up in the middle of the night and I</v>

1360
00:59:39.140 --> 00:59:41.330
<v Speaker 4>didn't have enough credits to graduate</v>
<v Speaker 4>and have to go back.</v>

1361
00:59:41.940 --> 00:59:46.520
<v Speaker 4>Then it was sitting there in my bed</v>
<v Speaker 4>before I woke up trying to decide</v>

1362
00:59:46.521 --> 00:59:51.170
<v Speaker 4>whether or not I was just going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking drop out and not graduate from</v>

1363
00:59:51.171 --> 00:59:54.020
<v Speaker 4>high school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not have a high school diploma or go</v>

1364
00:59:54.021 --> 00:59:56.990
<v Speaker 4>back and do another fucking year of</v>
<v Speaker 4>hell.</v>

1365
00:59:57.420 --> 00:59:59.930
<v Speaker 4>And it was my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my guts would turn and I'd wake up and</v>

1366
01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:00.920
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I graduated.</v>

1367
01:00:00.950 --> 01:00:01.720

01:00:31.330 --> 01:00:32.320
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was the same way.</v>

1379
01:00:32.350 --> 01:00:35.680
<v Speaker 3>Just just skated by high school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I remember I didn't even want</v>

1380
01:00:35.681 --> 01:00:37.240
<v Speaker 3>to walk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fucking hated it so much.</v>

1381
01:00:37.241 --> 01:00:40.960
<v Speaker 3>I actually rode my skateboard with my</v>
<v Speaker 3>friends that were like much older than</v>

1382
01:00:40.961 --> 01:00:42.790
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Daddy go skateboarding with every day</v>

1383
01:00:42.940 --> 01:00:46.120
<v Speaker 3>and we were skateboarding by the high</v>
<v Speaker 3>school is everyone walked and got their</v>

1384
01:00:46.121 --> 01:00:47.800
<v Speaker 3>diploma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just.</v>

1385
01:00:47.950 --> 01:00:49.280
<v Speaker 3>Did you get your diploma?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That?</v>

1386
01:00:49.300 --> 01:00:50.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they sent it to me,</v>

1387
01:00:50.171 --> 01:00:52.150
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't want to fucking be there.</v>

1388
01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.320
<v Speaker 4>Go to my graduation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1389
01:00:54.321 --> 01:00:56.440
<v Speaker 4>I'm gone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is.</v>

1390
01:00:56.840 --> 01:00:58.070
<v Speaker 4>Once I got through it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1391
01:00:58.071 --> 01:01:01.250
<v Speaker 4>you don't have me anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can be free.</v>

1392
01:01:01.710 --> 01:01:04.010
<v Speaker 4>It took me a while to figure out what</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fuck to do next.</v>

1393
01:01:04.510 --> 01:01:05.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would sit there and they will be like,</v>

1394
01:01:05.771 --> 01:01:07.690
<v Speaker 3>so what do you want to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like counselors?</v>

1395
01:01:07.691 --> 01:01:09.520
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just want to play drums in a band</v>

1396
01:01:09.521 --> 01:01:11.020
<v Speaker 3>really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they'd be like,</v>

1397
01:01:11.350 --> 01:01:16.060
<v Speaker 3>well that's not an option.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you going to talk to me?</v>

1398
01:01:16.061 --> 01:01:18.130
<v Speaker 3>Like I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just insane.</v>

1399
01:01:18.430 --> 01:01:19.263
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that crazy?</v>

1400
01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:21.610
<v Speaker 4>There's so many bands and there's so</v>
<v Speaker 4>many drummers.</v>

1401
01:01:21.730 --> 01:01:22.900
<v Speaker 4>Why is that not an option?</v>

1402
01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is that not an option?</v>

1403
01:01:24.650 --> 01:01:26.300
<v Speaker 3>It'd be better if they just said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1404
01:01:26.570 --> 01:01:28.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I don't know if they motivated you</v>

1405
01:01:28.581 --> 01:01:31.910
<v Speaker 3>to actually do what you're passionate</v>
<v Speaker 3>about instead of just being,</v>

1406
01:01:31.911 --> 01:01:33.170
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's not gonna happen,</v>

1407
01:01:33.171 --> 01:01:34.130
<v Speaker 3>so what do you want to do?</v>

1408
01:01:35.650 --> 01:01:39.460
<v Speaker 4>Fucking people that probably wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 4>be drummers and just never got a push</v>

1409
01:01:39.461 --> 01:01:40.420
<v Speaker 4>and never,</v>
<v Speaker 4>never,</v>

1410
01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:44.680
<v Speaker 4>never made it through.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then there's the other argument that</v>

1411
01:01:44.681 --> 01:01:46.770
<v Speaker 4>if you really want it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll find a.</v>

1412
01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:48.710
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to do it.</v>

1413
01:01:48.711 --> 01:01:50.360
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my dad used to tell me the same thing.</v>

1414
01:01:50.361 --> 01:01:53.840
<v Speaker 3>He'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you gotta have a plan B,</v>

1415
01:01:55.100 --> 01:01:57.320
<v Speaker 3>and I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1416
01:01:57.321 --> 01:01:59.270
<v Speaker 3>if I have a plan B,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to try that hard.</v>

1417
01:01:59.490 --> 01:02:02.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started thinking in my head and then</v>

1418
01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:04.430
<v Speaker 3>that's when I just said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nah,</v>

1419
01:02:04.431 --> 01:02:05.540
<v Speaker 3>fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1420
01:02:05.590 --> 01:02:08.500
<v Speaker 3>it's only this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no matter if I'm rich or poor,</v>

1421
01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:10.790
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever the circumstances,</v>

1422
01:02:11.210 --> 01:02:14.000
<v Speaker 3>this is what I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't give a fuck what the</v>

1423
01:02:14.001 --> 01:02:14.834
<v Speaker 3>outcome is.</v>

1424
01:02:14.970 --> 01:02:19.020
<v Speaker 4>I think that's the right mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think people get by that.</v>

1425
01:02:19.770 --> 01:02:22.800
<v Speaker 4>When I was just starting to do standup,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a lot of guys who had full</v>

1426
01:02:22.801 --> 01:02:25.930
<v Speaker 4>time jobs and they got degrees and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

1427
01:02:25.950 --> 01:02:28.950
<v Speaker 4>they would work their full time job and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then they would just do standup at a</v>

1428
01:02:28.951 --> 01:02:31.050
<v Speaker 4>couple of nights a week.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They never made it.</v>

1429
01:02:31.510 --> 01:02:36.150
<v Speaker 4>It was the obsessed guys and women,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the people that were just like,</v>

1430
01:02:36.180 --> 01:02:38.100
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is my fucking life.</v>

1431
01:02:38.130 --> 01:02:40.380
<v Speaker 4>This is what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to do this.</v>

1432
01:02:40.710 --> 01:02:43.230
<v Speaker 4>Those are the ones that do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that no safety net people and the ones</v>

1433
01:02:43.231 --> 01:02:43.980
<v Speaker 4>that made it.</v>

1434
01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:45.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's going to fucking happen.</v>

1435
01:02:45.900 --> 01:02:48.780
<v Speaker 3>You just have to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to stick with it.</v>

1436
01:02:49.710 --> 01:02:53.040
<v Speaker 3>I feel like the people who really stick</v>
<v Speaker 3>with it and give it like 110 percent,</v>

1437
01:02:53.610 --> 01:02:55.070
<v Speaker 3>your time will come.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It will,</v>

1438
01:02:55.230 --> 01:02:57.420
<v Speaker 3>however big or small it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something will happen,</v>

1439
01:02:57.630 --> 01:02:58.170
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1440
01:02:58.170 --> 01:02:59.220
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1441
01:02:59.221 --> 01:03:02.790
<v Speaker 4>If you figure it out and keep improving</v>
<v Speaker 4>and keep learning and learn from your</v>

1442
01:03:02.791 --> 01:03:06.990
<v Speaker 4>mistakes and learn from your setbacks</v>
<v Speaker 4>and keep trying to push and get better</v>

1443
01:03:06.991 --> 01:03:10.950
<v Speaker 4>and improve.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you do all those things is as</v>

1444
01:03:11.010 --> 01:03:14.640
<v Speaker 4>hopeless and helpless as it seems.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you continue to improve,</v>

1445
01:03:14.670 --> 01:03:17.610
<v Speaker 4>you've got to get to a better place,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got to get better and one day you'll</v>

1446
01:03:17.611 --> 01:03:20.550
<v Speaker 4>be undeniable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you don't,</v>

1447
01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:23.490
<v Speaker 4>and if you just fall back on that safety</v>
<v Speaker 4>net,</v>

1448
01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:27.300
<v Speaker 4>you're always gonna wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're always going to look at Travis</v>

1449
01:03:27.300 --> 01:03:29.690
<v Speaker 4>Barker going fucking hand on the drums</v>
<v Speaker 4>going,</v>

1450
01:03:29.700 --> 01:03:30.810
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That could have been me,</v>

1451
01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:31.891
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I almost did it.</v>

1452
01:03:31.891 --> 01:03:33.510
<v Speaker 3>I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at one point in my pops,</v>

1453
01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:35.560
<v Speaker 3>my pops is awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

1454
01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:40.190
<v Speaker 3>he's a Vietnam vet and wrote him a</v>
<v Speaker 3>Harley his whole life and he just</v>

1455
01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:41.220
<v Speaker 3>basically said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

1456
01:03:41.221 --> 01:03:42.620
<v Speaker 3>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you gotta eat,</v>

1457
01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:44.390
<v Speaker 3>they gotta start paying rent at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>house because,</v>

1458
01:03:44.410 --> 01:03:47.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not in high school anymore or a</v>

1459
01:03:47.630 --> 01:03:52.350
<v Speaker 3>and get like a 60 hour a week job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a real job or you need to go,</v>

1460
01:03:52.450 --> 01:03:54.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go fucking play drums but you're not</v>

1461
01:03:54.121 --> 01:03:56.490
<v Speaker 3>going to do it here in my garage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was like,</v>

1462
01:03:56.491 --> 01:03:58.110
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was probably the best thing that</v>

1463
01:03:58.111 --> 01:03:59.130
<v Speaker 3>was ever said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1464
01:03:59.131 --> 01:04:04.131
<v Speaker 3>as harsh as it was or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I had actually caved in and I</v>

1465
01:04:04.141 --> 01:04:05.910
<v Speaker 3>just told my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my friend Nola was like,</v>

1466
01:04:05.940 --> 01:04:08.370
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm just gonna I'm going to get</v>

1467
01:04:08.371 --> 01:04:11.070
<v Speaker 3>this fucking job because I just somehow</v>
<v Speaker 3>got a job that made,</v>

1468
01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:13.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a warehouse it was like target</v>

1469
01:04:13.111 --> 01:04:16.230
<v Speaker 3>warehouse making pretty good money</v>
<v Speaker 3>compared to what I was making at the</v>

1470
01:04:16.231 --> 01:04:17.064
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

1471
01:04:17.310 --> 01:04:19.700
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he hit me the next day and he's</v>

1472
01:04:19.710 --> 01:04:21.300
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you're making a big mistake.</v>

1473
01:04:21.301 --> 01:04:24.840
<v Speaker 3>I think you're very fucking talented and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you'll regret this and you can</v>

1474
01:04:24.841 --> 01:04:27.600
<v Speaker 3>get this bullshit job any anytime down</v>
<v Speaker 3>the line,</v>

1475
01:04:28.020 --> 01:04:29.150
<v Speaker 3>come live with me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1476
01:04:29.190 --> 01:04:30.780

<v Speaker 3>You could sleep on the floor,</v>

1477
01:04:30.781 --> 01:04:34.410
<v Speaker 3>the couch and let's play in this fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>band and do it.</v>

1478
01:04:34.770 --> 01:04:35.910
<v Speaker 3>And I did it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1479
01:04:35.911 --> 01:04:39.900
<v Speaker 3>I was like a trash man in Laguna beach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lived in like this studio apartment with</v>

1480
01:04:39.901 --> 01:04:43.770
<v Speaker 3>a couple of the guys and just fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>took off.</v>

1481
01:04:43.830 --> 01:04:46.350
<v Speaker 3>Like I had to like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was like humility too,</v>

1482
01:04:46.351 --> 01:04:48.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was like playing bar after bar and</v>

1483
01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:50.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1484
01:04:50.980 --> 01:04:52.590
<v Speaker 3>but I was eating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was eating,</v>

1485
01:04:52.591 --> 01:04:53.341
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1486
01:04:53.341 --> 01:04:55.560
<v Speaker 3>I was skateboarding every day and I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>living at the beach,</v>

1487
01:04:55.561 --> 01:04:59.010
<v Speaker 3>playing in a band with my friend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for me I had already made it.</v>

1488
01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:02.460
<v Speaker 3>Those are the best stories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the best stories.</v>

1489
01:05:02.490 --> 01:05:05.250
<v Speaker 3>And I think back even to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go to Laguna sometimes I'm like,</v>

1490
01:05:05.610 --> 01:05:07.650
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was kind of one of the best moments</v>

1491
01:05:07.651 --> 01:05:11.280
<v Speaker 3>of my life besides my children being</v>
<v Speaker 3>born like poor,</v>

1544
01:07:17.951 --> 01:07:20.940

01:07:20.941 --> 01:07:25.770
<v Speaker 3>my neck and she always had to see it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's the only time I've ever done</v>

<v Speaker 3>To me.</v>

1550
01:07:30.650 --> 01:07:33.180
<v Speaker 3>It all tells a story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a moment in time and I got it</v>

<v Speaker 3>for a reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was trying to be cool and you know</v>

01:09:44.570 --> 01:09:45.440
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I lost,</v>

1609
01:09:45.620 --> 01:09:47.990
<v Speaker 3>I lost my first tattoo ever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was a dag nasty.</v>

1610
01:09:47.991 --> 01:09:52.760
<v Speaker 3>Tattoos is hardcore band punk band that</v>
<v Speaker 3>I loved forever in a bones tattoo,</v>

1611
01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:55.200
<v Speaker 3>which was my nickname growing up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1612
01:09:55.490 --> 01:09:58.620
<v Speaker 3>but I lost everything on my legs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then they do like,</v>

1613
01:09:59.270 --> 01:10:02.030
<v Speaker 3>they do what's called that grafting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they.</v>

1614
01:10:02.090 --> 01:10:03.680
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I lost some tattoos from my back so</v>

1615
01:10:03.681 --> 01:10:06.500
<v Speaker 3>they take,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a cheese grater and they grade</v>

1616
01:10:06.530 --> 01:10:11.530
<v Speaker 3>all of your skin off your back and my</v>
<v Speaker 3>thighs and then they staple it to you</v>

1617
01:10:12.351 --> 01:10:15.290
<v Speaker 3>with pig cadaver and they will wait for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1618
01:10:15.590 --> 01:10:16.880
<v Speaker 3>for you to start healing.</v>

1619
01:10:17.420 --> 01:10:19.130
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so yeah.</v>

1620
01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:23.360
<v Speaker 3>So I lost a lot of tattoos and then I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did like on my thighs.</v>

1621
01:10:23.361 --> 01:10:24.230
<v Speaker 3>You can't really see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did,</v>

1622
01:10:24.290 --> 01:10:27.650
<v Speaker 3>I did memorials for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for though Chris Chain,</v>

1623
01:10:27.730 --> 01:10:29.900
<v Speaker 3>a Dj am who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1624
01:10:29.930 --> 01:10:34.730
<v Speaker 3>who all passed away in the accident.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I put them on my legs over the graph</v>

1625
01:10:34.731 --> 01:10:36.350
<v Speaker 3>so you can't really see it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

1626
01:10:36.351 --> 01:10:40.190
<v Speaker 3>I mean I got out pretty well man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I mean you can kind of see it on my</v>

1627
01:10:40.191 --> 01:10:40.881
<v Speaker 3>hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my hand.</v>

1628
01:10:40.881 --> 01:10:45.710
<v Speaker 3>You can see it's discolored and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But for having almost 70 percent of my</v>

1629
01:10:45.711 --> 01:10:47.690
<v Speaker 3>body burnt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you can't really tell.</v>

1630
01:10:48.110 --> 01:10:49.160
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1631
01:10:49.220 --> 01:10:52.060
<v Speaker 3>Really tell it all because you're so</v>
<v Speaker 3>tattooed up that up.</v>

1632
01:10:52.220 --> 01:10:56.150
<v Speaker 3>The pain of healing burns is supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be excruciating.</v>

1633
01:10:56.270 --> 01:10:59.210
<v Speaker 3>It's the fucking worst thing ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well for,</v>

1634
01:10:59.290 --> 01:11:00.800
<v Speaker 3>for me to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1635
01:11:00.860 --> 01:11:02.840
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you guys ever think about</v>
<v Speaker 3>being burnt.</v>

1636
01:11:02.870 --> 01:11:05.030
<v Speaker 3>I know I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would just be like,</v>

1637
01:11:05.180 --> 01:11:08.570
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just never think about fire until</v>

1638
01:11:08.571 --> 01:11:10.700
<v Speaker 3>you're on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you're like,</v>

1639
01:11:10.701 --> 01:11:12.170
<v Speaker 3>oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then.</v>

1640
01:11:12.620 --> 01:11:15.240
<v Speaker 3>And then</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1641
01:11:15.410 --> 01:11:18.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the treatments afterwards to like do</v>

1642
01:11:18.151 --> 01:11:19.170
<v Speaker 3>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1643
01:11:19.171 --> 01:11:22.290
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they would put me in this big pan</v>

1644
01:11:22.291 --> 01:11:26.010
<v Speaker 3>that was literally about as big as this</v>
<v Speaker 3>table with different people all around</v>

1645
01:11:26.011 --> 01:11:28.860
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they would scrape all my brain with</v>

1646
01:11:28.861 --> 01:11:31.290
<v Speaker 3>a metal brush to get rid of all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>infection because I had,</v>

1647
01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:35.400
<v Speaker 3>I basically when I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I jumped through the emergency</v>

1648
01:11:35.401 --> 01:11:36.840
<v Speaker 3>exit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I open the emergency exit,</v>

1649
01:11:36.841 --> 01:11:40.080
<v Speaker 3>before the plane blew up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in such a hurry to get out of the</v>

1650
01:11:40.380 --> 01:11:43.530
<v Speaker 3>plane and exit the plane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I jumped right into the jet,</v>

1651
01:11:44.190 --> 01:11:48.270
<v Speaker 3>which is full of fuel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So my whole body lit up,</v>

1652
01:11:48.420 --> 01:11:52.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I had jet fuel just in my whole body,</v>

1653
01:11:52.861 --> 01:11:55.500
<v Speaker 3>like I burped jet fuel for almost three</v>
<v Speaker 3>months.</v>

1654
01:11:56.670 --> 01:11:59.760
<v Speaker 3>So they had like that was the main thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get rid of the infection is they</v>

1655
01:11:59.761 --> 01:12:03.780
<v Speaker 3>scrub you with a metal brush to get rid</v>
<v Speaker 3>of all of it and all of the dead skin.</v>

1656
01:12:04.170 --> 01:12:08.310
<v Speaker 3>And then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I did about 30 surgeries to</v>

1657
01:12:08.550 --> 01:12:10.560
<v Speaker 3>repair everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like skin graft surgeries.</v>

1658
01:12:10.830 --> 01:12:13.290
<v Speaker 3>They saved my foot because at one point</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were going to amputate my right</v>

1659
01:12:13.291 --> 01:12:14.790
<v Speaker 3>foot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1660
01:12:14.820 --> 01:12:18.160
<v Speaker 3>It was wild.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would picture strategy burnt that they</v>

1661
01:12:18.450 --> 01:12:21.420
<v Speaker 3>have to amputate my right foot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Almost didn't make it.</v>

1662
01:12:21.450 --> 01:12:24.960
<v Speaker 3>Was it because of the way it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was it was necrosis or like what was</v>

1663
01:12:24.961 --> 01:12:26.550
<v Speaker 3>going on that they were going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>amputate it?</v>

1664
01:12:26.610 --> 01:12:30.870
<v Speaker 3>I think because that was the thing that</v>
<v Speaker 3>was most soaked was,</v>

1665
01:12:30.930 --> 01:12:34.320
<v Speaker 3>was my shoes and socks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I jumped into the jets,</v>

1666
01:12:34.380 --> 01:12:36.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I had done,</v>

1667
01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:39.840
<v Speaker 3>I had exited the plane,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started running,</v>

1668
01:12:39.930 --> 01:12:44.400
<v Speaker 3>I started like ripping off my clothes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just that's what my instinct told me.</v>

1669
01:12:44.510 --> 01:12:47.940
<v Speaker 3>Just get rid of everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But little did I know I would still be</v>

1670
01:12:47.941 --> 01:12:50.610
<v Speaker 3>on fire because the jet fuel was soaked</v>
<v Speaker 3>in it.</v>

1671
01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:56.300
<v Speaker 3>So I'm actually running towards a</v>
<v Speaker 3>highway highways right on the side of me</v>

1672
01:12:56.670 --> 01:12:58.310
<v Speaker 3>and I just hear some guy yelled,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1673
01:12:58.311 --> 01:12:59.640
<v Speaker 3>stop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>drop and roll.</v>

1674
01:12:59.850 --> 01:13:03.510
<v Speaker 3>And it just like I heard it out of all</v>
<v Speaker 3>this chaos of every sirens and</v>

1675
01:13:03.511 --> 01:13:05.720
<v Speaker 3>everything and I stopped dropping</v>
<v Speaker 3>enrolled.</v>

1676
01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:09.030
<v Speaker 3>And the only thing that was still on</v>
<v Speaker 3>fire was my feet in,</v>

1677
01:13:09.031 --> 01:13:10.400
<v Speaker 3>am came in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1678
01:13:10.510 --> 01:13:13.440
<v Speaker 3>patted them out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think they were on fire the longest</v>

1679
01:13:13.441 --> 01:13:15.450
<v Speaker 3>two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So still like my,</v>

1680
01:13:15.620 --> 01:13:19.560
<v Speaker 3>I think my right foot is probably like</v>
<v Speaker 3>over 50 percent of it's a graft.</v>

1681
01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:20.700
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1682
01:13:21.330 --> 01:13:22.580
<v Speaker 3>it's wild,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>

1683
01:13:23.010 --> 01:13:23.791
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was like,</v>

1684
01:13:23.791 --> 01:13:25.140
<v Speaker 3>I never,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

1685
01:13:25.141 --> 01:13:27.510
<v Speaker 3>I never even thought about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not something you think about until</v>

1686
01:13:27.511 --> 01:13:30.180
<v Speaker 3>it happens to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but being burnt is like,</v>

1687
01:13:30.181 --> 01:13:31.080
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1688
01:13:31.110 --> 01:13:32.370
<v Speaker 3>it's horrific.</v>

1689
01:13:32.430 --> 01:13:34.920
<v Speaker 3>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Were you affected by the recent fires</v>

1690
01:13:34.921 --> 01:13:38.190
<v Speaker 3>out here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It came about a couple hundred yards</v>

1691
01:13:38.191 --> 01:13:39.810
<v Speaker 3>from one of my houses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>

1692
01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:42.720
<v Speaker 3>But I was in Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was actually playing a show.</v>

1693
01:13:43.020 --> 01:13:46.920
<v Speaker 3>We left that morning and then we got</v>
<v Speaker 3>phone calls saying you got to evacuate,</v>

1694
01:13:46.921 --> 01:13:48.600
<v Speaker 3>but we were already gone with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank God.</v>

1695
01:13:48.601 --> 01:13:49.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1696
01:13:49.620 --> 01:13:51.510
<v Speaker 3>my dogs with me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1697
01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:53.940
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my housekeeper was at the house so she</v>

1698
01:13:53.941 --> 01:13:56.810
<v Speaker 3>was able to get the rest of our dogs out</v>
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>

1699
01:13:56.970 --> 01:13:57.803
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were,</v>

1700
01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:00.150
<v Speaker 3>as long as I had them there with me and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1701
01:14:00.151 --> 01:14:02.340
<v Speaker 3>everything else is replaceable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's whatever.</v>

1702
01:14:02.790 --> 01:14:03.511
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

1703
01:14:03.511 --> 01:14:04.650

<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1704
01:14:05.310 --> 01:14:08.620
<v Speaker 3>you saw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously you live very close to it.</v>

1705
01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:10.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we got evacuated.</v>

1706
01:14:10.081 --> 01:14:12.100
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>while we ourselves,</v>

1707
01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:14.710
<v Speaker 4>before they had a mandatory at two in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the morning,</v>

1708
01:14:14.711 --> 01:14:18.130
<v Speaker 4>I came back from the comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My wife and I were looking out the</v>

1709
01:14:18.131 --> 01:14:20.950
<v Speaker 4>window in the flames are coming over the</v>
<v Speaker 4>hill and I said,</v>

1710
01:14:20.951 --> 01:14:22.930
<v Speaker 4>no one's going to save us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here I go,</v>

1711
01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:25.120
<v Speaker 4>we have to figure out what the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to do.</v>

1712
01:14:25.390 --> 01:14:26.860
<v Speaker 4>And she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we should go.</v>

1713
01:14:27.250 --> 01:14:28.240
<v Speaker 4>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>alright,</v>

1714
01:14:28.300 --> 01:14:30.820
<v Speaker 4>I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we just got a hotel room and we just</v>

1715
01:14:30.821 --> 01:14:35.140
<v Speaker 4>bailed and I just grabbed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I literally grabbed my laptop and I</v>

1716
01:14:35.141 --> 01:14:36.390
<v Speaker 4>think that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some,</v>

1717
01:14:36.460 --> 01:14:39.580
<v Speaker 4>some clothes and then the kids were a</v>
<v Speaker 4>little freaked out.</v>

1718
01:14:39.581 --> 01:14:40.081
<v Speaker 4>But I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1719
01:14:40.081 --> 01:14:41.860
<v Speaker 4>we'll just look.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're here.</v>

1720
01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:44.590
<v Speaker 4>We're all right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like we could buy more shit.</v>

1721
01:14:45.010 --> 01:14:46.900
<v Speaker 4>Like the dog's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're fine.</v>

1722
01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:48.640
<v Speaker 4>That's how I was too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1723
01:14:49.060 --> 01:14:50.140
<v Speaker 4>let it burn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1724
01:14:50.230 --> 01:14:52.330
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want it to burn obviously,</v>

1725
01:14:52.331 --> 01:14:54.670
<v Speaker 4>but rather than you being hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1726
01:14:54.671 --> 01:14:55.720
<v Speaker 4>fuck man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>

1727
01:14:55.990 --> 01:14:59.280
<v Speaker 4>this is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an inconvenience when when you're,</v>

1728
01:14:59.340 --> 01:15:02.740
<v Speaker 4>when you lose your house,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a horrific tragedy when you lose</v>

1729
01:15:02.741 --> 01:15:03.850
<v Speaker 4>your life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1730
01:15:03.851 --> 01:15:05.740
<v Speaker 4>we're not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to get the fuck outta here.</v>

1731
01:15:06.210 --> 01:15:08.800
<v Speaker 4>And so they were freaked out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But within a day or two,</v>

1732
01:15:08.830 --> 01:15:11.860
<v Speaker 4>I mean we stayed in a hotel for a week,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but within a day or two they were.</v>

1733
01:15:11.890 --> 01:15:13.420
<v Speaker 4>They were cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were laughing about it.</v>

1734
01:15:13.450 --> 01:15:15.070
<v Speaker 3>Same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We did the same thing that came,</v>

1735
01:15:15.130 --> 01:15:18.460
<v Speaker 3>came home but did not really home at a</v>
<v Speaker 3>hotel for a week.</v>

1736
01:15:18.970 --> 01:15:21.280
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you felt kind of helpless,</v>

1737
01:15:21.281 --> 01:15:22.580
<v Speaker 3>like you couldn't do much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1738
01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:25.990
<v Speaker 3>it's not like I could sit there and and</v>
<v Speaker 3>put out the fire myself,</v>

1739
01:15:25.991 --> 01:15:27.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they wouldn't even let us in our</v>

1740
01:15:27.071 --> 01:15:27.580
<v Speaker 3>community.</v>

1741
01:15:27.580 --> 01:15:28.590
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Same here.</v>

1742
01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:31.840
<v Speaker 4>Crazy for people that weren't around</v>
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>

1743
01:15:31.870 --> 01:15:36.700
<v Speaker 4>They don't know how crazy it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the sky was filled with smoke</v>

1744
01:15:36.970 --> 01:15:40.600
<v Speaker 4>everywhere you looked with smoke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean all of La was filled with smoke.</v>

1745
01:15:40.601 --> 01:15:41.770
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never,</v>

1746
01:15:41.830 --> 01:15:43.540
<v Speaker 4>we were.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We stayed in Beverly Hills at the</v>

1747
01:15:43.541 --> 01:15:47.530
<v Speaker 4>Waldorf and you look out the balcony</v>
<v Speaker 4>window and it's just fucking gray.</v>

1748
01:15:47.740 --> 01:15:50.860
<v Speaker 4>Just smoke everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never seen fires like that before.</v>

1749
01:15:50.861 --> 01:15:51.694
<v Speaker 4>Never in my life</v>

1750
01:15:51.710 --> 01:15:53.660
<v Speaker 3>neither.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I always see we're on high alert.</v>

1751
01:15:53.930 --> 01:15:57.260
<v Speaker 3>Do you not see it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like my kids are at school over in</v>

1752
01:15:57.261 --> 01:16:01.820
<v Speaker 3>Malibu or really close to there and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>always see high alert but nothing's ever</v>

1753
01:16:01.821 --> 01:16:02.880
<v Speaker 3>really happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1754
01:16:02.881 --> 01:16:05.840
<v Speaker 3>there's been small fires,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that was horrific.</v>

1755
01:16:05.841 --> 01:16:08.450
<v Speaker 3>That was just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it looked like Hiroshima in our</v>

1756
01:16:08.451 --> 01:16:09.730
<v Speaker 3>neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you know,</v>

1757
01:16:09.770 --> 01:16:14.330
<v Speaker 3>airplanes flying really low,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dropping fire retardant and it was,</v>

1758
01:16:14.390 --> 01:16:15.230
<v Speaker 3>it was crazy.</v>

1759
01:16:15.650 --> 01:16:19.190
<v Speaker 4>Bill burr flies helicopters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got his helicopter license and we</v>

1760
01:16:19.191 --> 01:16:24.191
<v Speaker 4>took a flight around Malibu around point</v>
<v Speaker 4>dume and you go over there and you see</v>

1761
01:16:24.471 --> 01:16:28.040
<v Speaker 4>these massive estates just burnt to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>ground.</v>

1762
01:16:28.070 --> 01:16:33.070
<v Speaker 4>These gorgeous houses with the perfect</v>
<v Speaker 4>view on the bluff overlooking the ocean.</v>

1763
01:16:33.530 --> 01:16:35.960
<v Speaker 4>Gone huge lots,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1764
01:16:35.961 --> 01:16:40.580
<v Speaker 4>$20,000,000 houses gone just burnt to</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ground and there's so many of them.</v>

1765
01:16:40.610 --> 01:16:44.180
<v Speaker 4>And then like one house standing there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one house out of just random.</v>

1766
01:16:44.540 --> 01:16:46.860
<v Speaker 3>That's how it was in our neighborhood to</v>
<v Speaker 3>house caught fire,</v>

1767
01:16:46.861 --> 01:16:48.630
<v Speaker 3>but nothing near it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Caught fire hose.</v>

1768
01:16:48.660 --> 01:16:49.480
<v Speaker 3>It's weird.</v>

1769
01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:50.201
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some shit.</v>

1770
01:16:50.201 --> 01:16:53.680
<v Speaker 4>We'll fly through the air land on</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone's house and if you have like</v>

1771
01:16:53.980 --> 01:16:57.610
<v Speaker 4>pine needles or something on your roof</v>
<v Speaker 4>or a flammable roof,</v>

1772
01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:00.880
<v Speaker 4>just catches,</v>
<v Speaker 4>catches on fire.</v>

1773
01:17:00.910 --> 01:17:03.090
<v Speaker 4>Was it a campfire that started taking</v>
<v Speaker 4>part?</v>

1774
01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:04.790
<v Speaker 4>It's called Campfire.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1775
01:17:04.900 --> 01:17:08.050
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it was a campfire.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was the name of the fire.</v>

1776
01:17:08.110 --> 01:17:09.660
<v Speaker 4>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>

1777
01:17:09.710 --> 01:17:12.170
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what the fuck the cause of</v>
<v Speaker 4>that fire was.</v>

1778
01:17:12.171 --> 01:17:13.280
<v Speaker 4>Jamie CV.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You find that out.</v>

1779
01:17:13.370 --> 01:17:16.250
<v Speaker 4>Do you know what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've been trying to blame or blame</v>

1780
01:17:16.251 --> 01:17:18.980
<v Speaker 4>has been put on like different utility</v>
<v Speaker 4>companies and whatnot.</v>

1781
01:17:18.981 --> 01:17:21.020
<v Speaker 4>And they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not taking the blame or they can</v>

1782
01:17:21.021 --> 01:17:23.810
<v Speaker 4>prove that it wasn't them and wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's been being passed around.</v>

1783
01:17:23.811 --> 01:17:26.600
<v Speaker 4>I don't know that anybody knows yet what</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been looking at.</v>

1784
01:17:26.830 --> 01:17:29.420
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's fucking crazy though,</v>

1785
01:17:29.421 --> 01:17:30.201
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When,</v>

1786
01:17:30.201 --> 01:17:31.190
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was in boulder,</v>

1787
01:17:31.191 --> 01:17:35.360
<v Speaker 4>there was a giant fire that broke out</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was a fireman accidentally started</v>

1788
01:17:36.020 --> 01:17:36.680
<v Speaker 4>a fire.</v>

1789
01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:39.320
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He had a fire pit in his backyard and</v>

1790
01:17:39.580 --> 01:17:44.580
<v Speaker 4>some fucking embers blew out of his fire</v>
<v Speaker 4>pit and started a giant fire and just</v>

1791
01:17:45.180 --> 01:17:50.180
<v Speaker 4>burn massive amounts of wild forest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just gone.</v>

1792
01:17:50.750 --> 01:17:52.450
<v Speaker 4>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A fireman.</v>

1793
01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:55.850
<v Speaker 4>I imagine he must,</v>
<v Speaker 4>must've felt like shit.</v>

1794
01:17:56.650 --> 01:17:57.920
<v Speaker 4>It mean anybody start.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1795
01:17:58.010 --> 01:18:02.060
<v Speaker 4>just couldn't fucking imagine if it was</v>
<v Speaker 4>your fault that one of these things get</v>

1796
01:18:02.061 --> 01:18:03.410
<v Speaker 4>started.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

1797
01:18:03.411 --> 01:18:04.480
<v Speaker 4>The guilt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would.</v>

1798
01:18:05.380 --> 01:18:08.690
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't be sleeping for weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Decrease territory is northern</v>

1799
01:18:08.691 --> 01:18:11.570
<v Speaker 4>California.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Northern California got it way where we</v>

1800
01:18:11.571 --> 01:18:13.520
<v Speaker 4>got it bad down here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>worse than I've ever seen.</v>

1801
01:18:13.521 --> 01:18:15.590
<v Speaker 4>But they get it way worse in northern</v>
<v Speaker 4>California,</v>

1802
01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:19.160
<v Speaker 4>Northern California.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They lost a shitload of people died on</v>

1803
01:18:19.161 --> 01:18:21.650
<v Speaker 4>the highway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I see burned to death in</v>

1804
01:18:21.651 --> 01:18:23.420
<v Speaker 4>their cars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see those photos?</v>

1805
01:18:23.510 --> 01:18:25.580
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck man.</v>

1806
01:18:26.910 --> 01:18:29.990
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of this is because of,</v>

1807
01:18:30.470 --> 01:18:31.910
<v Speaker 4>you mean there's a lot of issues,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1808
01:18:31.911 --> 01:18:34.270
<v Speaker 4>There's the dry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1809
01:18:34.450 --> 01:18:36.110
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fact that dry climate,</v>

1810
01:18:36.111 --> 01:18:39.230
<v Speaker 4>the fact that climate change is</v>
<v Speaker 4>happening,</v>

1811
01:18:39.231 --> 01:18:43.910
<v Speaker 4>but also the fact that there is no small</v>
<v Speaker 4>fires like although those dead trees are</v>

1812
01:18:43.911 --> 01:18:48.560
<v Speaker 4>supposed to get knocked down by small</v>
<v Speaker 4>fires like controlled fires and those,</v>

1813
01:18:48.740 --> 01:18:51.950
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't really happen anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't want small fires that can</v>

1814
01:18:51.951 --> 01:18:56.330
<v Speaker 4>possibly get out of hand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so you have these forests that are</v>

1815
01:18:56.331 --> 01:19:01.010
<v Speaker 4>oftentimes filled with dead trees right</v>
<v Speaker 4>next to live trees and a lot of dead</v>

1816
01:19:01.011 --> 01:19:02.150
<v Speaker 4>trees all over the place.</v>

1817
01:19:02.490 --> 01:19:03.600
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they're supposed to do,</v>

1818
01:19:03.630 --> 01:19:05.970
<v Speaker 3>that's like maintenance burning like the</v>
<v Speaker 3>small gallons</v>

1819
01:19:06.050 --> 01:19:09.130
<v Speaker 4>before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's May mean some people advocate</v>

1820
01:19:09.131 --> 01:19:12.190
<v Speaker 4>doing it for maintenance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but in nature that's like a natural</v>

1821
01:19:12.191 --> 01:19:14.110
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the lightning would hit light</v>

1822
01:19:14.111 --> 01:19:18.310
<v Speaker 4>something shit on fire and the live</v>
<v Speaker 4>trees would probably survive and a lot</v>

1823
01:19:18.311 --> 01:19:21.640
<v Speaker 4>of the dead ones would burn to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>ground and we'd actually regenerate the</v>

1824
01:19:21.641 --> 01:19:22.474
<v Speaker 4>forest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1825
01:19:22.870 --> 01:19:25.210
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the crazy thing is like you look</v>

1826
01:19:25.211 --> 01:19:28.060
<v Speaker 4>how fucking lush and green it looks out</v>
<v Speaker 4>here now,</v>

1827
01:19:28.340 --> 01:19:31.840
<v Speaker 4>but you would never imagine that just a</v>
<v Speaker 4>few months ago this was a raging</v>

1828
01:19:31.841 --> 01:19:35.710
<v Speaker 4>inferno.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It actually is good for the ground,</v>

1829
01:19:36.190 --> 01:19:37.060
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and all that</v>

1830
01:19:37.090 --> 01:19:39.350
<v Speaker 3>still smells like fire too right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Prices.</v>

1831
01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:41.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every time it rains it's starting to get</v>

1832
01:19:41.711 --> 01:19:44.350
<v Speaker 3>a little bit better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But does it freak you out when you see</v>

1833
01:19:44.351 --> 01:19:46.930
<v Speaker 3>fire now because of your accident?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1834
01:19:46.931 --> 01:19:49.480
<v Speaker 3>it took a little while for us to have</v>
<v Speaker 3>pyro again.</v>

1835
01:19:49.820 --> 01:19:52.900
<v Speaker 3>Oh you never.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like we just got back together</v>

1836
01:19:54.970 --> 01:19:58.390
<v Speaker 3>and like this really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really like killer,</v>

1837
01:19:58.391 --> 01:20:01.540
<v Speaker 3>like photographer had this idea to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>this photo shoot and they wanted us</v>

1838
01:20:01.541 --> 01:20:06.480
<v Speaker 3>holding like the watchman call it the</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing like the flares accent.</v>

1839
01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:09.810
<v Speaker 3>He got me to hold it for a second and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>

1840
01:20:09.811 --> 01:20:12.780
<v Speaker 3>oh bro,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't do this wrong photo shoot.</v>

1841
01:20:12.790 --> 01:20:14.670
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1842
01:20:14.671 --> 01:20:17.670
<v Speaker 3>I know you have this vision,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's an insensitive vision.</v>

1843
01:20:17.671 --> 01:20:19.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I.</v>

1844
01:20:19.980 --> 01:20:21.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1845
01:20:21.230 --> 01:20:22.740
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would have been a little bit more</v>

1846
01:20:22.741 --> 01:20:26.720
<v Speaker 3>fitting but.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then and now we do pyro stuff on,</v>

1847
01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:27.930
<v Speaker 3>on stage and production.</v>

1848
01:20:27.970 --> 01:20:31.410
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't really bug me but I'm very</v>
<v Speaker 3>cautious around the house.</v>

1849
01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:35.490
<v Speaker 3>Like with my daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she has like a straight iron plugged in</v>

1850
01:20:35.491 --> 01:20:38.430
<v Speaker 3>or for my son,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever lights a candle.</v>

1851
01:20:38.431 --> 01:20:40.800
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm so crazy about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which</v>

1852
01:20:42.630 --> 01:20:45.710
<v Speaker 3>are a little weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I have to ask you this,</v>

1853
01:20:45.720 --> 01:20:47.910
<v Speaker 3>Tom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Talk about Ufos all the time.</v>

1854
01:20:48.300 --> 01:20:49.440
<v Speaker 3>Well you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not in the band.</v>

1855
01:20:49.490 --> 01:20:50.560
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

1856
01:20:50.860 --> 01:20:53.040
<v Speaker 3>but I always do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He always did.</v>

1857
01:20:53.250 --> 01:20:57.990
<v Speaker 3>We used to get loaded and just look out</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bus window and I used to do it with</v>

1858
01:20:57.991 --> 01:20:58.910
<v Speaker 3>him as like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

1859
01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:03.120
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of a bonding experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like if you wanted to show me bow</v>

1860
01:21:03.121 --> 01:21:04.850
<v Speaker 3>and arrows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever were on tour together,</v>

1861
01:21:04.950 --> 01:21:06.130
<v Speaker 3>I sit there and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1862
01:21:06.180 --> 01:21:07.710
<v Speaker 3>check it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So with Tom,</v>

1863
01:21:07.711 --> 01:21:10.590
<v Speaker 3>that was his thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like fucking let's get high and look for</v>

1864
01:21:10.591 --> 01:21:13.830
<v Speaker 3>Ufo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he would just sit there and like</v>

1865
01:21:13.860 --> 01:21:17.220
<v Speaker 3>stare out the bus window,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at Ufo or like he would even go as</v>

1866
01:21:17.221 --> 01:21:20.550
<v Speaker 3>far as when we're on tour,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like let's go and fucking look for</v>

1867
01:21:20.551 --> 01:21:21.384
<v Speaker 3>bigfoot.</v>

1868
01:21:21.860 --> 01:21:23.470
<v Speaker 3>But whatever it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1869
01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:26.280
<v Speaker 3>and he would assemble a crew and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>would go do it.</v>

1870
01:21:26.340 --> 01:21:28.530
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never got me on one of those trips</v>

1871
01:21:28.531 --> 01:21:30.600
<v Speaker 3>because that was just to fairy tale for</v>
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

1872
01:21:30.601 --> 01:21:32.130
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>

1873
01:21:32.210 --> 01:21:33.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd do that.</v>

1874
01:21:33.061 --> 01:21:36.690
<v Speaker 3>And he was always,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really not something he just got</v>

1875
01:21:36.691 --> 01:21:41.691
<v Speaker 3>into from the day I fucking met him when</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was obsessed with Ufo and aliens and</v>

1876
01:21:41.761 --> 01:21:45.720
<v Speaker 3>was always very passionate about it to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the point where like I didn't know</v>

1877
01:21:45.721 --> 01:21:49.830
<v Speaker 3>enough to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to have any kind of,</v>

1878
01:21:49.860 --> 01:21:53.030
<v Speaker 3>I guess like opinion on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just very open and,</v>

1879
01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:55.050
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just took it all in,</v>

1880
01:21:56.190 --> 01:21:58.260
<v Speaker 3>but nothing has changed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's still,</v>

1881
01:21:58.410 --> 01:21:59.370
<v Speaker 3>the other day I talked to him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

1882
01:21:59.371 --> 01:22:00.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm on the way to the fucking White</v>
<v Speaker 3>House Bro.</v>

1883
01:22:02.480 --> 01:22:05.580
<v Speaker 3>And I don't ask any questions I like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you should be,</v>

1884
01:22:05.610 --> 01:22:06.443
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

1885
01:22:07.250 --> 01:22:11.550
<v Speaker 3>Let's fucking go get a great response.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1886
01:22:11.580 --> 01:22:12.450
<v Speaker 3>Good luck with that.</v>

1887
01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:15.540
<v Speaker 4>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's crazy.</v>

1888
01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:16.770
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was a trip man.</v>

1889
01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:19.920
<v Speaker 4>Having a conversation with him was very</v>
<v Speaker 4>strange because I'm,</v>

1890
01:22:19.921 --> 01:22:23.970
<v Speaker 4>a part of me was like skype putting me</v>
<v Speaker 4>on like what is happening is dead ass</v>

1891
01:22:24.230 --> 01:22:27.450
<v Speaker 4>just seemed like it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we would look at these videos that</v>

1892
01:22:27.451 --> 01:22:31.020
<v Speaker 4>were so clearly horseshit and he would</v>
<v Speaker 4>be like amazing.</v>

1893
01:22:31.021 --> 01:22:31.830
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they're like,</v>

1894
01:22:31.830 --> 01:22:34.920
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you think that that's an actual</v>

1895
01:22:34.921 --> 01:22:37.170
<v Speaker 4>Ufo?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that is the fakest fucking video.</v>

1896
01:22:37.171 --> 01:22:39.630
<v Speaker 4>I've ever seen in my life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he didn't see that at all,</v>

1897
01:22:39.820 --> 01:22:43.680
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in his mind he was seeing a real alien</v>

1898
01:22:43.681 --> 01:22:44.514
<v Speaker 4>spaceship.</v>

1899
01:22:44.540 --> 01:22:45.830
<v Speaker 3>Even on tour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be like,</v>

1900
01:22:45.890 --> 01:22:47.880
<v Speaker 3>walk in my room and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you doing?</v>

1901
01:22:47.910 --> 01:22:48.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1902
01:22:48.260 --> 01:22:49.760
<v Speaker 3>check this thing out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just made up whatever,</v>

1903
01:22:49.761 --> 01:22:50.594
<v Speaker 3>playing drums.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'd be like,</v>

1904
01:22:51.020 --> 01:22:52.790
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking whatever.</v>

1905
01:22:52.791 --> 01:22:55.400
<v Speaker 3>George Bush just did you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he needs just coming at me with some</v>

1906
01:22:55.401 --> 01:22:57.470
<v Speaker 3>like politics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's been watching CNN or,</v>

1907
01:22:57.920 --> 01:23:01.190
<v Speaker 3>or like he's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's always been obsessed with it,</v>

1908
01:23:01.850 --> 01:23:04.820
<v Speaker 3>so he's obsessed with all sorts of like</v>
<v Speaker 3>hidden things,</v>

1909
01:23:04.821 --> 01:23:06.030
<v Speaker 3>so not just Ufo</v>

1910
01:23:06.090 --> 01:23:07.310
<v Speaker 4>but big foot too.</v>

1911
01:23:07.460 --> 01:23:09.410
<v Speaker 3>Conspiracy theories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>politics,</v>

1912
01:23:09.980 --> 01:23:11.690
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very,</v>

1913
01:23:11.750 --> 01:23:15.950
<v Speaker 3>very passionate about all those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Conspiracy theories and politics.</v>

1914
01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:17.600
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting how those things</v>

1915
01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:21.180
<v Speaker 4>go together because people are always</v>
<v Speaker 4>wondering like,</v>

1916
01:23:21.181 --> 01:23:24.510
<v Speaker 4>who the fuck is running things?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's really going on?</v>

1917
01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:28.650
<v Speaker 4>What's happening behind the scenes?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who's pulling the strings?</v>

1918
01:23:28.770 --> 01:23:32.040
<v Speaker 4>What is it all really mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

1919
01:23:33.370 --> 01:23:35.070
<v Speaker 4>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the UFO thing,</v>

1920
01:23:35.071 --> 01:23:36.060
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>boy,</v>

1921
01:23:36.690 --> 01:23:37.550
<v Speaker 4>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you gotta.</v>

1922
01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:40.440
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I absolutely believe there could be</v>

1923
01:23:40.441 --> 01:23:44.580
<v Speaker 4>intelligent life out there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I haven't seen a fucking single</v>

1924
01:23:44.581 --> 01:23:47.310
<v Speaker 4>thing that makes me think that anybody's</v>
<v Speaker 4>got a picture</v>

1925
01:23:47.790 --> 01:23:48.750
<v Speaker 3>video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1926
01:23:48.770 --> 01:23:50.880
<v Speaker 3>I feel like it could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it could be real.</v>

1927
01:23:50.881 --> 01:23:52.540
<v Speaker 3>I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not,</v>

1928
01:23:52.680 --> 01:23:56.610
<v Speaker 3>I can't fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not dedicating my life to search for</v>

1929
01:23:56.611 --> 01:23:57.460
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1930
01:23:57.960 --> 01:24:01.860
<v Speaker 3>and I give it to a man to like honestly</v>
<v Speaker 3>to walk away from your fucking very</v>

1931
01:24:01.861 --> 01:24:06.861
<v Speaker 3>successful band to go do that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I have nothing but respect for his</v>

1932
01:24:07.381 --> 01:24:10.590
<v Speaker 3>passion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's like I couldn't do that.</v>

1933
01:24:10.620 --> 01:24:11.550
<v Speaker 3>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1934
01:24:11.551 --> 01:24:14.220
<v Speaker 3>It's like that just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it really shows like he's,</v>

1935
01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:16.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's very,</v>

1936
01:24:16.381 --> 01:24:18.570
<v Speaker 3>very passionate about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It will be saved up some money.</v>

1937
01:24:18.750 --> 01:24:19.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>me too.</v>

1938
01:24:21.020 --> 01:24:22.180
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a survivor.</v>

1939
01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:24.410
<v Speaker 4>Survivorman Les Stroud.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nah,</v>

1940
01:24:24.620 --> 01:24:25.940
<v Speaker 4>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you ever see that show?</v>

1941
01:24:25.990 --> 01:24:28.590
<v Speaker 4>A fucking great show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He would.</v>

1942
01:24:28.820 --> 01:24:33.710
<v Speaker 4>Survivor man would go out into the woods</v>
<v Speaker 4>with a limited amount of things.</v>

1943
01:24:33.770 --> 01:24:34.640
<v Speaker 4>He would say like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1944
01:24:34.641 --> 01:24:37.550
<v Speaker 4>I've got this bucket,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've got a fucking pocket knife and I</v>

1945
01:24:37.551 --> 01:24:41.180
<v Speaker 4>got a ball,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a ball of yarn and I'm going to survive</v>

1946
01:24:41.181 --> 01:24:44.870
<v Speaker 4>out here for seven days.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in and he films the whole thing and</v>

1947
01:24:44.871 --> 01:24:48.500
<v Speaker 4>he'd be filming himself like eating</v>
<v Speaker 4>frogs and catching a squirrel and</v>

1948
01:24:48.501 --> 01:24:52.570
<v Speaker 4>finding edible plants and just living</v>
<v Speaker 4>out in the forest and oftentimes going</v>

1949
01:24:52.580 --> 01:24:56.210
<v Speaker 4>days and days without food.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then he would have like a point</v>

1950
01:24:56.211 --> 01:24:59.030
<v Speaker 4>where he'd get rescued seven days in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there would be a spot where they would</v>

1951
01:24:59.031 --> 01:24:59.930
<v Speaker 4>meet him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1952
01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:05.320
<v Speaker 4>he had an experience when he was in</v>
<v Speaker 4>Alaska a long time ago where he was</v>

1953
01:25:05.421 --> 01:25:10.040
<v Speaker 4>camping and he said he heard footsteps,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like big heavy footsteps.</v>

1954
01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:12.960
<v Speaker 4>And you heard some sound that sounded</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a gorilla,</v>

1955
01:25:13.990 --> 01:25:18.800
<v Speaker 4>like something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then it ran off.</v>

1956
01:25:18.890 --> 01:25:22.580
<v Speaker 4>And to this day he's convinced that that</v>
<v Speaker 4>was a big foot.</v>

1957
01:25:22.970 --> 01:25:27.970
<v Speaker 4>And so now he has survivor man bigfoot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he goes out into the woods and just</v>

1958
01:25:29.991 --> 01:25:32.360
<v Speaker 4>looks for evidence of sasquatch.</v>

1959
01:25:32.940 --> 01:25:33.660
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he should.</v>

1960
01:25:33.660 --> 01:25:34.650
<v Speaker 3>He needs to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He needs,</v>

1961
01:25:34.651 --> 01:25:35.400
<v Speaker 3>they hit up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tom.</v>

1962
01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:37.160
<v Speaker 3>Tom pull up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'll go with.</v>

1963
01:25:37.170 --> 01:25:39.450
<v Speaker 3>And he would love that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure he would.</v>

1964
01:25:39.451 --> 01:25:40.284
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

1965
01:25:40.840 --> 01:25:42.300
<v Speaker 4>He's trying to get me to go with them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1966
01:25:42.340 --> 01:25:43.510
<v Speaker 4>good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did.</v>

1967
01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:47.380
<v Speaker 4>I did it one time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went hunting for big foot for a</v>

1968
01:25:47.381 --> 01:25:50.110
<v Speaker 4>television show I did for Scifi.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I called Joe Rogan questions,</v>

1969
01:25:50.111 --> 01:25:53.650
<v Speaker 4>everything we went looking for bigfoot</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the more I talk to these big foot</v>

1970
01:25:53.651 --> 01:25:57.010
<v Speaker 4>folks that Maura was convinced,</v>
<v Speaker 4>none of these motherfuckers have ever</v>

1971
01:25:57.011 --> 01:25:59.710
<v Speaker 4>seen big flood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was one lady that I talked to,</v>

1972
01:25:59.770 --> 01:26:04.520
<v Speaker 4>one lady who just did not seem like a</v>
<v Speaker 4>liar and she was telling me that she saw</v>

1973
01:26:04.521 --> 01:26:08.390
<v Speaker 4>something in the woods and it was</v>
<v Speaker 4>standing up and it was tall,</v>

1974
01:26:08.391 --> 01:26:09.710
<v Speaker 4>like seven,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eight feet tall,</v>

1975
01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:12.650
<v Speaker 4>and she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why is there a gorilla in the woods?</v>

1976
01:26:13.220 --> 01:26:15.020
<v Speaker 4>And then she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>

1977
01:26:15.050 --> 01:26:16.730
<v Speaker 4>that's pig foot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he said,</v>

1978
01:26:16.780 --> 01:26:21.500
<v Speaker 4>and it was the Pacific northwest outside</v>
<v Speaker 4>of Washington state or in Washington</v>

1979
01:26:21.501 --> 01:26:25.130
<v Speaker 4>state outside of Seattle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the woods are so dense up there that</v>

1980
01:26:25.131 --> 01:26:27.260
<v Speaker 4>if anything goes 10,</v>
<v Speaker 4>20 feet,</v>

1981
01:26:27.261 --> 01:26:28.094
<v Speaker 4>it's gone.</v>

1982
01:26:28.490 --> 01:26:31.460
<v Speaker 4>The problem with that is that there's</v>
<v Speaker 4>black bears up there in black bear,</v>

1983
01:26:31.461 --> 01:26:34.590
<v Speaker 4>sometimes standing up on two feet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They do it all the time and if you saw a</v>

1984
01:26:34.591 --> 01:26:37.000
<v Speaker 4>blackfoot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially a black bear rather,</v>

1985
01:26:37.010 --> 01:26:39.680
<v Speaker 4>especially from a distance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you would think it was a big gorilla.</v>

1986
01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:41.960
<v Speaker 4>It was standing up on two feet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which they do do,</v>

1987
01:26:42.110 --> 01:26:43.460
<v Speaker 4>especially when they're trying to see</v>
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>

1988
01:26:43.461 --> 01:26:47.060
<v Speaker 4>They'll stand up and they'll even walk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a lot of videos of them walking</v>

1989
01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:51.320
<v Speaker 4>on two feet and just never seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy.</v>

1990
01:26:51.321 --> 01:26:55.520
<v Speaker 4>I could see a big 400 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I think,</v>

1991
01:26:55.550 --> 01:26:56.383
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that lady is</v>

1992
01:26:56.490 --> 01:26:57.360
<v Speaker 2>liar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

1993
01:26:57.720 --> 01:26:58.553
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't.</v>

1994
01:26:59.010 --> 01:27:00.900
<v Speaker 2>She might look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might be real.</v>

1995
01:27:00.930 --> 01:27:02.220
<v Speaker 2>There might be a few of them left.</v>

1996
01:27:02.380 --> 01:27:06.700
<v Speaker 4>There definitely was a thing called</v>
<v Speaker 4>gigantic [inaudible] that lived in Asia</v>

1997
01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:10.180
<v Speaker 4>and the thought is that it came across</v>
<v Speaker 4>the bering land bridge the same time</v>

1998
01:27:10.181 --> 01:27:14.850
<v Speaker 4>that native Americans came across from</v>
<v Speaker 4>Asia and that they came across and</v>

1999
01:27:15.130 --> 01:27:19.750
<v Speaker 4>because they lived in Asia and this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this gigantic Pythius I think lived as</v>

2000
01:27:19.751 --> 01:27:24.751
<v Speaker 4>recently I think as 100,000 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the most recent fossils they</v>

2001
01:27:25.691 --> 01:27:28.180
<v Speaker 4>have of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is human beings were alive back</v>

2002
01:27:28.181 --> 01:27:32.530
<v Speaker 4>then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this thing was a six or an eight to</v>

2003
01:27:32.531 --> 01:27:36.490
<v Speaker 4>10 foot tall bipedal hominid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it was a huge,</v>

2004
01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:39.490
<v Speaker 4>huge apelike creature.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So check this out.</v>

2005
01:27:39.491 --> 01:27:40.240
<v Speaker 4>This is a</v>

2006
01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:43.520
<v Speaker 2>look at this bear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the craziest shit ever.</v>

2007
01:27:44.060 --> 01:27:46.430
<v Speaker 2>Bears walking on two legs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at him.</v>

2008
01:27:46.670 --> 01:27:49.050
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2010
01:27:52.281 --> 01:27:55.550

<v Speaker 2>Especially if you believe the hype and</v>

2011
01:27:55.551 --> 01:27:57.800
<v Speaker 2>do your search for big foot out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>You see his right foot or something</v>

2020
01:28:10.911 --> 01:28:12.950
<v Speaker 2>wrong with his right foot sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2021
01:28:12.980 --> 01:28:16.910
<v Speaker 2>It looks like he's missing his front.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paws says sometimes bears will fight</v>

2022
01:28:16.911 --> 01:28:18.230
<v Speaker 2>with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One barrel.</v>

2023
01:28:18.650 --> 01:28:23.150
<v Speaker 2>Bite the bear's foot off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or he could have gotten shot or it could</v>

2024
01:28:23.151 --> 01:28:25.610
<v Speaker 2>have broke it off on something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2026
01:28:27.170 --> 01:28:28.220
<v Speaker 2>He's missing a foot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's.</v>

2027
01:28:28.610 --> 01:28:32.210

<v Speaker 2>But everybody else.</v>

<v Speaker 2>when I'm talking to them,</v>

2029
01:28:34.940 --> 01:28:36.560

<v Speaker 2>Walking around.</v>

<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2035
01:28:48.710 --> 01:28:52.580

<v Speaker 2>feeding them.</v>

01:28:56.420 --> 01:29:00.340
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't seem like America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>South Korea is South Korea.</v>

2038
01:29:00.580 --> 01:29:01.920
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 2>where the animals are all.</v>

2040
01:29:06.090 --> 01:29:07.770
<v Speaker 2>And you're in a car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean wildlife,</v>

2042
01:29:10.591 --> 01:29:13.440

<v Speaker 2>Have you ever see that video where the</v>

2043
01:29:13.441 --> 01:29:16.320

<v Speaker 2>of those parks and she got in a fight</v>

2044

<v Speaker 2>with her boyfriend.</v>

<v Speaker 2>She's more fucked up because her mom</v>
<v Speaker 2>came out to rescue her.</v>

<v Speaker 2>hands.</v>

2067
01:30:02.041 --> 01:30:06.060
<v Speaker 2>He smothered to death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jacked him while he was jogging.</v>

2068
01:30:06.270 --> 01:30:08.820
<v Speaker 2>He was running on the trails.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The mountain lion grabbed him from</v>

2069
01:30:08.821 --> 01:30:10.770
<v Speaker 2>behind.</v>

<v Speaker 2>able to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe is a Jujitsu guy.</v>

2075
01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.580
<v Speaker 2>We see him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen him when my kids were really</v>

2076
01:30:32.581 --> 01:30:37.440
<v Speaker 2>young in Calabasas where I live,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw one like just pacing back and</v>

<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

2080
01:30:44.251 --> 01:30:46.650
<v Speaker 2>But mountain lions,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2082
01:30:48.180 --> 01:30:50.880
<v Speaker 2>A friend of mine just sent me a message</v>
<v Speaker 2>this morning when I was.</v>

2083
01:30:51.240 --> 01:30:53.910
<v Speaker 2>When I posted that thing on instagram</v>
<v Speaker 2>about that guy that killed it and he</v>

2084
01:30:53.911 --> 01:30:58.911
<v Speaker 2>said he was running on this fire road</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he realized he like,</v>

2085
01:30:59.460 --> 01:31:04.460
<v Speaker 2>felt weird and looked over and 20 feet</v>
<v Speaker 2>away from him was a big cat right above</v>

2086
01:31:05.911 --> 01:31:08.370
<v Speaker 2>him on this Ridge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 feet.</v>

2087
01:31:08.700 --> 01:31:12.900
<v Speaker 2>So that's basically us to that wall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Big Cat just look at and he said he</v>

2088
01:31:12.901 --> 01:31:17.790
<v Speaker 2>waved his arms to look bigger and think</v>
<v Speaker 2>just walked away like a.</v>

2089
01:31:18.570 --> 01:31:23.570
<v Speaker 2>I carry a knife when I run,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I carry a fucking half phase blades has</v>

2090
01:31:24.501 --> 01:31:27.660
<v Speaker 2>got to like a loop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could stick your thumb into it so it</v>

2091
01:31:27.661 --> 01:31:31.230
<v Speaker 2>stays in your hand and people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are you running with a knife?</v>

2092
01:31:31.231 --> 01:31:34.860
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck he doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you don't need it until you do.</v>

2093
01:31:35.370 --> 01:31:39.580
<v Speaker 2>And when you do you want to have it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Didn't someone get attacked by a coyote</v>

2094
01:31:39.581 --> 01:31:43.530
<v Speaker 2>and hidden hills?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like running to the story about that.</v>

2095
01:31:43.531 --> 01:31:46.680
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ran in my neighborhood before and it</v>

2096
01:31:47.300 --> 01:31:51.780
<v Speaker 2>to coyotes ran right past me and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>usually don't mess with like humans,</v>

2097
01:31:51.781 --> 01:31:54.570
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well we had a problem with them killing</v>

2098
01:31:54.571 --> 01:31:58.410
<v Speaker 2>chickens because chickens in my yard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've lost a bunch of chickens to.</v>

2099
01:31:58.411 --> 01:31:59.170
<v Speaker 2>Coyotes were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were,</v>

2100
01:31:59.170 --> 01:32:00.250
<v Speaker 2>they were on top of the chicken</v>

2101
01:32:00.250 --> 01:32:01.960
<v Speaker 4>coop,</v>
<v Speaker 4>poem tiles off of it.</v>

2102
01:32:02.510 --> 01:32:04.870
<v Speaker 4>They're creepy little fuckers man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're little,</v>

2103
01:32:04.890 --> 01:32:06.400
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these are like 35,</v>

2104
01:32:06.401 --> 01:32:08.680
<v Speaker 4>45 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not very big,</v>

2105
01:32:08.681 --> 01:32:12.580
<v Speaker 4>but they're creepy and some about their</v>
<v Speaker 4>little wolves and they're looking at you</v>

2106
01:32:12.581 --> 01:32:14.560
<v Speaker 4>and they're trying to figure out a way</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what can they eat,</v>

2107
01:32:14.561 --> 01:32:16.510
<v Speaker 4>what can't the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're out there scraping,</v>

2108
01:32:16.810 --> 01:32:18.910
<v Speaker 4>scraping and grinding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're sneaky.</v>

2109
01:32:18.911 --> 01:32:19.744
<v Speaker 4>Like</v>

2110
01:32:19.870 --> 01:32:22.200
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I saw one of my friends,</v>

2111
01:32:22.201 --> 01:32:25.670
<v Speaker 3>a dear friend of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lost both of his dogs to coyotes and he</v>

2112
01:32:25.671 --> 01:32:27.620
<v Speaker 3>had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he had like surveillance of it</v>

2113
01:32:27.950 --> 01:32:30.080
<v Speaker 3>and one is in the yard and he's playing</v>
<v Speaker 3>dead.</v>

2114
01:32:30.860 --> 01:32:33.800
<v Speaker 3>And then his dogs approach what they</v>
<v Speaker 3>think is dead.</v>

2115
01:32:34.250 --> 01:32:39.250
<v Speaker 3>And then basically like his home,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he comes out of nowhere and attacks and</v>

2116
01:32:40.100 --> 01:32:41.990
<v Speaker 3>a both.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the one that's playing dead attacks</v>

2117
01:32:42.320 --> 01:32:44.880
<v Speaker 3>and both of his dogs were a rap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How big dogs?</v>

2118
01:32:45.490 --> 01:32:47.090
<v Speaker 3>Small.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there were smaller dogs,</v>

2119
01:32:47.091 --> 01:32:49.910
<v Speaker 3>but now he has like big German shepherds</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's,</v>

2120
01:32:49.940 --> 01:32:51.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's kind of like got bigger dogs now.</v>

2121
01:32:51.801 --> 01:32:53.570
<v Speaker 3>But it was really sad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2122
01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:56.300
<v Speaker 3>It is a very tactical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like very,</v>

2123
01:32:57.140 --> 01:32:58.010
<v Speaker 3>very crazy.</v>

2124
01:32:58.290 --> 01:32:58.741
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

2125
01:32:58.741 --> 01:33:02.430
<v Speaker 4>they figure out some way to work and</v>
<v Speaker 4>cooperate together without</v>

2126
01:33:02.431 --> 01:33:04.190
<v Speaker 4>communicating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very interesting.</v>

2127
01:33:04.710 --> 01:33:07.230
<v Speaker 4>Like if it wasn't so sad that they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>killing someone's pat,</v>

2128
01:33:07.250 --> 01:33:09.180
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's really kind of fascinating that</v>

2129
01:33:09.181 --> 01:33:11.490
<v Speaker 4>they're so smart that they would play</v>
<v Speaker 4>dead.</v>

2130
01:33:12.810 --> 01:33:17.670
<v Speaker 4>There was a guy that used to work at</v>
<v Speaker 4>this pet store that I go to and he also</v>

2131
01:33:17.671 --> 01:33:21.060
<v Speaker 4>worked in a veterinary center,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a medical place,</v>

2132
01:33:21.330 --> 01:33:25.070
<v Speaker 4>and a pit bull came in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Big One of those big Jack pitbulls just</v>

2133
01:33:25.071 --> 01:33:27.480
<v Speaker 4>covered and cuts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cuts all over its body.</v>

2134
01:33:27.930 --> 01:33:29.390
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the owner was,</v>

2135
01:33:29.810 --> 01:33:31.350
<v Speaker 4>they asked the owner like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck happened?</v>

2136
01:33:31.351 --> 01:33:32.250
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2137
01:33:32.280 --> 01:33:34.500
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I came home and he's covered in cots.</v>

2138
01:33:34.501 --> 01:33:36.300
<v Speaker 4>I really have no idea what happened to</v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

2139
01:33:36.630 --> 01:33:39.380
<v Speaker 4>So they stitched the dog up like</v>
<v Speaker 4>hundreds of stitches all over the dog's</v>

2140
01:33:39.390 --> 01:33:42.930
<v Speaker 4>body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then he takes a walk outside of his</v>

2141
01:33:42.931 --> 01:33:47.580
<v Speaker 4>house and he follows his dog's blood and</v>
<v Speaker 4>he goes up into the hills near his house</v>

2142
01:33:47.581 --> 01:33:49.860
<v Speaker 4>and he finds nine dead coyotes.</v>

2143
01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:52.120
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That pit pole was</v>

2144
01:33:53.910 --> 01:33:57.660
<v Speaker 4>apparently tear and he said it looked</v>
<v Speaker 4>like Vietnam.</v>

2145
01:33:57.690 --> 01:34:01.770
<v Speaker 4>It looked like a fucking like saving</v>
<v Speaker 4>private Ryan just ripped apart coyotes.</v>

2146
01:34:02.040 --> 01:34:05.010
<v Speaker 4>Nine of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This motherfucker just went mall and</v>

2147
01:34:05.640 --> 01:34:08.850

<v Speaker 4>like this dog.</v>

2148
01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:09.720
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's nine of us.</v>

2149
01:34:09.721 --> 01:34:10.440

<v Speaker 4>We're good.</v>

2150
01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:14.580
<v Speaker 4>We got this guy here and then you see</v>
<v Speaker 4>this fucking fire hydrant head.</v>

2151
01:34:14.620 --> 01:34:17.730
<v Speaker 4>Just</v>
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't feel pain.</v>

2152
01:34:18.520 --> 01:34:21.720
<v Speaker 4>They've engineered those things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there's some pit bulls.</v>

<v Speaker 2>this dogs 110 pounds bigger.</v>

2179
01:35:34.660 --> 01:35:35.960
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it doesn't even make any sense.</v>

2180
01:35:40.430 --> 01:35:43.290
<v Speaker 2>So fucking tank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2181
01:35:43.291 --> 01:35:45.470
<v Speaker 2>but that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of my favorite coyote death,</v>

2182
01:35:45.710 --> 01:35:48.290
<v Speaker 2>death stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy going up into the hills and</v>

2183
01:35:48.291 --> 01:35:51.080
<v Speaker 2>find all these dead coyote just laying</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a pile.</v>

2184
01:35:51.890 --> 01:35:53.180
<v Speaker 2>They try to ambush them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When they would do,</v>

2185
01:35:53.181 --> 01:35:57.080
<v Speaker 2>they try to get one to come out and try</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get chased and then the one would run</v>

2186
01:35:57.230 --> 01:36:00.410
<v Speaker 2>and then the other ones would jump it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's like a gang straight up.</v>

2187
01:36:00.650 --> 01:36:03.860
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy that they think like that</v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

2188
01:36:03.990 --> 01:36:06.260
<v Speaker 2>The fact that they have actually have</v>
<v Speaker 2>strategies,</v>

2189
01:36:06.440 --> 01:36:08.060
<v Speaker 2>they're savages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2190
01:36:08.900 --> 01:36:11.930
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the downside of living in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the suburbs,</v>

2191
01:36:12.140 --> 01:36:14.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the upside is you get a nice yard and</v>

2192
01:36:14.211 --> 01:36:17.900
<v Speaker 2>he'd get a little view and yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>early.</v>

2221
01:37:24.260 --> 01:37:25.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

01:37:28.340 --> 01:37:29.640
<v Speaker 2>we don't normally see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2224
01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:35.080
<v Speaker 2>But I got to really think about it like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that fucking fire festival if they</v>

2225
01:37:35.601 --> 01:37:40.070
<v Speaker 2>had booked us on and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so glad because I would have had to</v>

2226
01:37:40.071 --> 01:37:42.650
<v Speaker 2>drive five or six days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2227
01:37:42.651 --> 01:37:44.330
<v Speaker 2>to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Florida to Fort Lauderdale,</v>

2228
01:37:44.340 --> 01:37:47.570
<v Speaker 2>then get in a boat and then get over to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bomb as.</v>

2229
01:37:47.930 --> 01:37:49.850
<v Speaker 2>So thank God man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I was,</v>

2230
01:37:49.851 --> 01:37:52.070
<v Speaker 2>I was literally on my way there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2231
01:37:52.071 --> 01:37:54.340
<v Speaker 2>So when you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you actually drive yourself or do you</v>

2232
01:37:54.341 --> 01:37:55.590
<v Speaker 2>have someone drive?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2233
01:37:55.591 --> 01:38:00.060
<v Speaker 2>I'd be white knuckling driving the tour</v>
<v Speaker 2>bus if you driven a fucking scary man</v>

2234
01:38:00.180 --> 01:38:01.040
<v Speaker 2>while you driving like this.</v>

2235
01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:04.920
<v Speaker 2>I've done it like wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when I was 19 or 20,</v>

2236
01:38:04.921 --> 01:38:08.130
<v Speaker 2>when I was on a tour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the driver let me drive and it was the</v>

2237
01:38:08.131 --> 01:38:09.660
<v Speaker 2>scariest fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2238
01:38:09.690 --> 01:38:13.500
<v Speaker 2>take the fucking wheel man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is so like a white knuckling,</v>

2239
01:38:13.501 --> 01:38:18.390
<v Speaker 2>like just being in control,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being responsible over that big of a</v>

2240
01:38:18.391 --> 01:38:20.730
<v Speaker 2>bus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And all of my homeys are all your</v>

2241
01:38:20.731 --> 01:38:22.260
<v Speaker 2>friends are sleeping in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

2242
01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:24.270
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh gosh man,</v>

2243
01:38:24.271 --> 01:38:28.860
<v Speaker 2>I give it bus drivers or that's a hard</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking job and a drive for,</v>

2244
01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:31.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we usually do eight to 10 hour</v>

2245
01:38:31.441 --> 01:38:34.380
<v Speaker 2>days a day bus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a long time.</v>

2246
01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:36.750
<v Speaker 2>It is a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's quite a drive.</v>

2247
01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:38.400
<v Speaker 2>But in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2248
01:38:38.460 --> 01:38:41.880
<v Speaker 2>they have to stay awake and maintain</v>
<v Speaker 2>their focus and I don't know about you</v>

2249
01:38:41.881 --> 01:38:45.780
<v Speaker 2>but when I see those white lines to</v>
<v Speaker 2>something about that,</v>

2250
01:38:45.781 --> 01:38:46.800
<v Speaker 2>it's not good for me.</v>

2251
01:38:46.800 --> 01:38:48.350
<v Speaker 2>I start non.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2252
01:38:48.360 --> 01:38:51.210
<v Speaker 2>It's like hypnotizing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is hypnotized.</v>

2253
01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:53.760
<v Speaker 2>You can do like two or three hours and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm cool.</v>

2254
01:38:53.761 --> 01:38:56.550
<v Speaker 2>I don't exactly know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>San Diego is about as far as I want to</v>

2255
01:38:56.551 --> 01:38:57.270
<v Speaker 2>drive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2256
01:38:57.270 --> 01:39:00.700
<v Speaker 2>They're built different and I know fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2257
01:39:00.701 --> 01:39:04.770
<v Speaker 2>they say it's way more dangerous to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the road in a bus or on a car than</v>

2258
01:39:04.771 --> 01:39:06.720
<v Speaker 2>being in a plane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

2259
01:39:07.040 --> 01:39:08.370
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one day I always say like,</v>

2260
01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:11.130
<v Speaker 2>my kids want to fly one day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I'll be down.</v>

2261
01:39:11.520 --> 01:39:16.520
<v Speaker 2>But the thought of me leaving to go play</v>
<v Speaker 2>some show or do something cool and</v>

2262
01:39:17.821 --> 01:39:20.370
<v Speaker 2>something happening while they're at</v>
<v Speaker 2>home like fucks me up.</v>

2263
01:39:20.750 --> 01:39:22.500
<v Speaker 2>So I don't really do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what you mean.</v>

2264
01:39:22.770 --> 01:39:23.910
<v Speaker 2>I can only imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2265
01:39:23.911 --> 01:39:26.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't think anybody's ever going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>able to understand what you've gone</v>

2266
01:39:26.791 --> 01:39:29.280
<v Speaker 2>through with that kind of an ordeal.</v>

2267
01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:34.600
<v Speaker 2>That plane crash where your friends died</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the pilots are dead and you managed</v>

2268
01:39:34.651 --> 01:39:38.790
<v Speaker 2>to get out alive but almost lost your</v>
<v Speaker 2>foot and burned half your body plus.</v>

2269
01:39:39.010 --> 01:39:40.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No fuck man.</v>

2270
01:39:40.980 --> 01:39:43.620
<v Speaker 2>It's crippling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I try not to let it be too much of a</v>

2271
01:39:43.621 --> 01:39:47.460
<v Speaker 2>handicap for traveling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but seemed like you seem like you got to</v>

2272
01:39:47.461 --> 01:39:49.260
<v Speaker 2>work around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You figured it out.</v>

2273
01:39:49.340 --> 01:39:51.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Australia can go fuck itself.</v>

2274
01:39:51.100 --> 01:39:52.130

<v Speaker 2>readily available to do that shit.</v>

2334
01:42:21.971 --> 01:42:22.804
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

2336
01:42:25.301 --> 01:42:27.520
<v Speaker 2>it's I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sit and scratch my head and go.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't know either.</v>

2338
01:42:29.110 --> 01:42:33.130
<v Speaker 2>I just fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's such a talented talented due to</v>

2339
01:42:33.160 --> 01:42:34.840
<v Speaker 2>manny's like such a good songwriter.</v>

2342
01:42:38.201 --> 01:42:40.270
<v Speaker 2>talented guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just so interesting that that's his</v>

2343
01:42:40.271 --> 01:42:41.610
<v Speaker 2>main point of focus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2344
01:42:41.770 --> 01:42:43.930
<v Speaker 2>I would think that if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if aliens were real,</v>

2345
01:42:43.990 --> 01:42:46.510
<v Speaker 2>trump would've told us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really do believe that.</v>

2346
01:42:46.530 --> 01:42:47.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy is,</v>

2347
01:42:47.470 --> 01:42:51.010
<v Speaker 2>he's such a fucking loose cannon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He became the president.</v>

2348
01:42:51.310 --> 01:42:54.880
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe they hid it from him or his</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking chaotic is shit is right now.</v>

2349
01:42:54.910 --> 01:42:55.950
<v Speaker 2>It was some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

2350
01:42:55.960 --> 01:42:57.620
<v Speaker 2>something would slip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2351
01:42:58.020 --> 01:42:58.520
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2352
01:42:58.520 --> 01:43:02.800
<v Speaker 2>I would think that if they told him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they brought him a dose of two</v>

2353
01:43:02.801 --> 01:43:05.410
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would want to know who killed JFK.</v>

2354
01:43:06.190 --> 01:43:09.010
<v Speaker 2>Those are two things I'd want to know if</v>
<v Speaker 2>I became the president and our aliens.</v>

2355
01:43:09.011 --> 01:43:09.970

2358
01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:14.950
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to defer to you guys.</v>

2359
01:43:14.950 --> 01:43:16.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a military expert.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2360
01:43:16.781 --> 01:43:18.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want war,</v>

2361
01:43:18.430 --> 01:43:20.380
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want you guys to have support.</v>

2362
01:43:20.381 --> 01:43:23.390
<v Speaker 2>I got full respect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tell me about the elite.</v>

2363
01:43:23.830 --> 01:43:25.180
<v Speaker 2>What do you got?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's it trump orders?</v>

<v Speaker 2>He did that.</v>

2365
01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:28.540
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The space fourth,</v>

2366
01:43:28.720 --> 01:43:32.930
<v Speaker 2>but that's because there's actually a</v>
<v Speaker 2>military strategy because they're</v>

2367
01:43:32.950 --> 01:43:37.660
<v Speaker 2>concerned that as technology improves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russians are going to be in space and</v>

2368
01:43:37.690 --> 01:43:41.830
<v Speaker 2>we're going to be in space or war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fight off the aliens.</v>

2369
01:43:42.060 --> 01:43:43.810
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like will Smith Type Shit?</v>

2370
01:43:44.340 --> 01:43:45.173
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at him.</v>

2371
01:43:45.490 --> 01:43:47.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mike pence is behind them going.</v>

2372
01:43:47.021 --> 01:43:48.040
<v Speaker 2>Jesus was going to say almost.</v>

2373
01:43:51.470 --> 01:43:52.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know man.</v>

2374
01:43:52.581 --> 01:43:54.830
<v Speaker 2>But if I became president and I never</v>
<v Speaker 2>will,</v>

2375
01:43:54.831 --> 01:43:56.870
<v Speaker 2>but if I did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are the two things that I'd want</v>

2376
01:43:56.871 --> 01:43:59.960
<v Speaker 2>to know who killed jfk and where the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking aliens.</v>

2377
01:44:00.710 --> 01:44:03.170
<v Speaker 2>Do you think they know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think they know anything more</v>

2378
01:44:03.171 --> 01:44:05.300
<v Speaker 2>than regular people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you've got to feel like they</v>

2379
01:44:05.301 --> 01:44:07.550
<v Speaker 2>come in every four years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone would open their mouth.</v>

2380
01:44:08.720 --> 01:44:10.470
<v Speaker 2>Somebody knows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody knows</v>

2381
01:44:12.680 --> 01:44:15.980
<v Speaker 2>he's an alien.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not going to rat on his friends.</v>

2382
01:44:15.981 --> 01:44:17.960
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you drive that car,</v>

2383
01:44:17.961 --> 01:44:20.540
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you the cake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just take it for a tour or just take it</v>

2384
01:44:20.541 --> 01:44:21.830
<v Speaker 2>for a spin out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will.</v>

2385
01:44:21.890 --> 01:44:23.870
<v Speaker 2>That fucking tests will make you believe</v>
<v Speaker 2>in aliens.</v>

2386
01:44:24.230 --> 01:44:27.290
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't even make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does not make sense.</v>

2387
01:44:29.180 --> 01:44:31.340
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I'm driving a computer when</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in a tesla.</v>

2388
01:44:32.260 --> 01:44:35.690
<v Speaker 2>It's like every car other than that</v>
<v Speaker 2>seems stupid.</v>

2389
01:44:35.870 --> 01:44:37.730
<v Speaker 2>So the first one you've had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2390
01:44:38.290 --> 01:44:40.760
<v Speaker 2>You're just completely in love with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sold.</v>

2391
01:44:41.180 --> 01:44:43.040
<v Speaker 2>Sold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I drove one.</v>

2392
01:44:43.100 --> 01:44:47.790
<v Speaker 2>There was a rental car company that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>sponsoring the podcast and it was like</v>

2393
01:44:47.791 --> 01:44:49.280
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like uber for rental cars.</v>

2394
01:44:49.460 --> 01:44:51.740
<v Speaker 2>They would drop off a rental car and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would.</v>

2395
01:44:51.770 --> 01:44:52.850
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember the name of that</v>
<v Speaker 2>company?</v>

2396
01:44:54.140 --> 01:44:56.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if they're around anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

2397
01:44:57.590 --> 01:44:58.101
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2398
01:44:58.101 --> 01:44:59.900
<v Speaker 2>I want to try a tesla,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I drove it.</v>

2399
01:44:59.901 --> 01:45:01.010
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is kind of interesting,</v>

2400
01:45:01.011 --> 01:45:03.590
<v Speaker 2>but this was years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like maybe five years ago.</v>

2401
01:45:03.591 --> 01:45:08.591
<v Speaker 2>Was that four years ago?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Five years ago it wasn't as impressive,</v>

2402
01:45:08.990 --> 01:45:13.760
<v Speaker 2>but now I got the model s p 100 d,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what he told me to get.</v>

2403
01:45:13.761 --> 01:45:14.361
<v Speaker 2>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

2404
01:45:14.361 --> 01:45:16.610
<v Speaker 2>I'll get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I drove that thing.</v>

2405
01:45:16.611 --> 01:45:18.740
<v Speaker 2>The moment I drove it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the very first,</v>

2489
01:48:35.100 --> 01:48:37.710

<v Speaker 2>I was originally going to get an f made</v>

2490
01:48:37.711 --> 01:48:41.790
<v Speaker 2>from him and I went there and I saw the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bronco and person with that matte silver</v>

2491
01:48:41.791 --> 01:48:43.500
<v Speaker 2>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

2492
01:48:44.120 --> 01:48:47.940
<v Speaker 2>Did I go scrap the fucking F J we need</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get this going.</v>

<v Speaker 2>list for a long time.</v>

2496
01:48:55.470 --> 01:48:58.260
<v Speaker 2>And then I think the build took close to</v>
<v Speaker 2>a year.</v>

2497
01:48:58.620 --> 01:49:02.310
<v Speaker 2>It's like close to a year.</v>

2521
01:49:56.820 --> 01:49:58.300
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was really impressed.</v>

2522
01:49:58.301 --> 01:49:59.350
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it fucking,</v>

2523
01:49:59.380 --> 01:50:00.730
<v Speaker 2>it was really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really fast.</v>

2524
01:50:00.760 --> 01:50:02.980
<v Speaker 2>Which one did he have?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did he have the 100 day?</v>

2525
01:50:03.340 --> 01:50:06.070
<v Speaker 2>I imagine it's the one before the one</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about because it was a</v>

2526
01:50:06.071 --> 01:50:07.930
<v Speaker 2>couple of years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those were fast.</v>

2527
01:50:07.931 --> 01:50:09.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was still impressive.</v>

2528
01:50:09.520 --> 01:50:11.020
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those were fast.</v>

2529
01:50:11.021 --> 01:50:14.200
<v Speaker 2>They're still fast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this one is fucking stupid.</v>

2530
01:50:14.250 --> 01:50:16.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make sense.</v>

2531

<v Speaker 2>It's like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like you're defying what you think</v>

2564
01:51:28.740 --> 01:51:30.000

<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

2565
01:51:30.100 --> 01:51:31.210
<v Speaker 2>where it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's.</v>

2566
01:51:31.260 --> 01:51:35.080

<v Speaker 2>Guys come before him and case everything</v>

2568
01:51:36.250 --> 01:51:37.083

2569
01:51:38.980 --> 01:51:43.420
<v Speaker 2>What did I conic photo</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the Freak party sign above his</v>

2570
01:51:43.421 --> 01:51:45.700
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like we planned it and</v>

2571
01:51:45.701 --> 01:51:47.890
<v Speaker 2>Steven Tyler,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Steven Tyler's mugshot and the</v>

2572
01:51:47.891 --> 01:51:52.330
<v Speaker 2>background</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy man he takes from your guys'</v>

2573
01:51:52.331 --> 01:51:54.880
<v Speaker 2>interview to where he's just like</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking stone.</v>

2574
01:51:54.881 --> 01:51:56.960
<v Speaker 2>Be Honest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So great.</v>

2575
01:51:57.010 --> 01:51:59.770
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he got stoned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he really inhaled.</v>

2576
01:52:00.070 --> 01:52:03.820
<v Speaker 2>He took like a tiny puff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he puffed it like a cigar</v>

2577
01:52:04.940 --> 01:52:06.100
<v Speaker 2>smokes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We didn't inhale.</v>

2578
01:52:06.220 --> 01:52:07.960
<v Speaker 2>He drinks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We drank.</v>

2579
01:52:08.230 --> 01:52:12.790
<v Speaker 2>That's what was interesting about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The blowback or the backlash is that we</v>

2580
01:52:12.791 --> 01:52:16.210
<v Speaker 2>drank for two hours before we even</v>
<v Speaker 2>busted out the weed,</v>

2581
01:52:16.510 --> 01:52:18.100
<v Speaker 2>but the weed was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are they doing?</v>

2582
01:52:18.430 --> 01:52:21.130
<v Speaker 2>God takes one hit of weed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are they doing?</v>

2583
01:52:21.950 --> 01:52:25.720
<v Speaker 2>And then it went crazy and stock</v>
<v Speaker 2>plummeted six percent,</v>

2584
01:52:26.460 --> 01:52:30.400
<v Speaker 2>but it went back up to nine percent</v>
<v Speaker 2>smoke before you drink.</v>

2585
01:52:30.401 --> 01:52:33.280
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you get really fucked up if you</v>

2586
01:52:33.281 --> 01:52:35.830
<v Speaker 2>don't smoke a lot and you smoke after</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've been drinking.</v>

2587
01:52:35.890 --> 01:52:36.850
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a wrap.</v>

2588
01:52:36.950 --> 01:52:37.783
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2589
01:52:38.770 --> 01:52:39.750
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He never seen it.</v>

2590
01:52:39.751 --> 01:52:40.960
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it affected him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

2591
01:52:41.020 --> 01:52:42.940
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's so.</v>

2592
01:52:43.780 --> 01:52:45.770
<v Speaker 2>His brain is wired so different.</v>

2593
01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:48.860
<v Speaker 4>You know what his brain is like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like you ever see like,</v>

2594
01:52:49.160 --> 01:52:51.500
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no disrespect to Pete Holmes,</v>

2595
01:52:51.501 --> 01:52:52.820
<v Speaker 4>but you know Pete Holmes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the comedian,</v>

2596
01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.640
<v Speaker 4>like look at his body and then look at</v>
<v Speaker 4>Usain bolt's.</v>

2597
01:52:56.420 --> 01:52:59.540
<v Speaker 4>That's how I feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the way if they had a race,</v>

2598
01:52:59.690 --> 01:53:03.500
<v Speaker 4>that's how I feel like with my brain in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the room with Elan's brain,</v>

2599
01:53:03.530 --> 01:53:03.921
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2600
01:53:03.921 --> 01:53:08.000
<v Speaker 4>these are barely the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Keep up man.</v>

2601
01:53:08.001 --> 01:53:10.550
<v Speaker 4>Like you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've had some crazy guests that are</v>

2602
01:53:10.551 --> 01:53:13.460
<v Speaker 4>talking about atoms and fucking the</v>
<v Speaker 4>universe and whatever else,</v>

2603
01:53:13.461 --> 01:53:15.730
<v Speaker 4>and you're always like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

2604
01:53:15.731 --> 01:53:19.580
<v Speaker 4>You keep up with everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an illusion to memorize things.</v>

2605
01:53:20.190 --> 01:53:21.470
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what the fuck I'm talking</v>

2606
01:53:21.471 --> 01:53:21.861
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They know.</v>

2607
01:53:21.861 --> 01:53:24.050
<v Speaker 4>They understand the actual concepts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

2608
01:53:24.051 --> 01:53:26.540
<v Speaker 4>I might be able to repeat things that</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've learned in red,</v>

2609
01:53:26.900 --> 01:53:28.610
<v Speaker 4>but I don't know what the fuck I'm</v>
<v Speaker 4>really talking about.</v>

2610
01:53:28.640 --> 01:53:30.500
<v Speaker 4>They know what the fuck they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I'm saying?</v>

2611
01:53:30.501 --> 01:53:34.190
<v Speaker 4>It's like if someone never did Jujitsu</v>
<v Speaker 4>before and they want to talk about</v>

2612
01:53:34.550 --> 01:53:37.760
<v Speaker 4>choking someone out a triangle and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>hear them say and I'm like,</v>

2613
01:53:37.780 --> 01:53:38.640
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yay.</v>

2614
01:53:38.660 --> 01:53:40.070
<v Speaker 4>That's how you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how you do it.</v>

2615
01:53:40.400 --> 01:53:42.770
<v Speaker 4>But they don't really know how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm saying?</v>

2616
01:53:42.830 --> 01:53:44.990
<v Speaker 4>But then if you're talking to hoists</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gracie,</v>

2617
01:53:45.210 --> 01:53:46.910
<v Speaker 4>he tells you how to choke someone out</v>
<v Speaker 4>with a triangle like this.</v>

2618
01:53:46.920 --> 01:53:49.580
<v Speaker 4>Motherfucker did it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He knows how to do it.</v>

2619
01:53:49.581 --> 01:53:52.820
<v Speaker 4>He does it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a different conversation,</v>

2620
01:53:53.330 --> 01:53:54.350
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's the difference.</v>

2621
01:53:54.351 --> 01:53:56.630
<v Speaker 4>Like me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like a spectator talking to these</v>

2622
01:53:56.660 --> 01:53:59.840
<v Speaker 4>geniuses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I just trying to pull information</v>

2623
01:53:59.841 --> 01:54:01.880
<v Speaker 4>out of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just trying to get them to talk,</v>

2624
01:54:02.160 --> 01:54:05.420
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just try to know a little bit about</v>

2625
01:54:05.421 --> 01:54:06.260
<v Speaker 4>what they're talking about.</v>

2626
01:54:06.440 --> 01:54:08.450
<v Speaker 4>The guys that were on a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

2627
01:54:08.451 --> 01:54:10.290
<v Speaker 4>what was it last week,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the guys that we're talking about like</v>

2628
01:54:10.400 --> 01:54:11.450
<v Speaker 4>longevity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like living.</v>

2629
01:54:12.120 --> 01:54:13.150
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Davidson,</v>

2630
01:54:13.150 --> 01:54:15.200
<v Speaker 4>Clara.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was pretty crazy.</v>

2631
01:54:15.260 --> 01:54:17.450
<v Speaker 4>Fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fascinating.</v>

2632
01:54:17.840 --> 01:54:18.650
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This.</v>

2633
01:54:18.650 --> 01:54:20.390
<v Speaker 4>I'm glad there's people like that out</v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

2634
01:54:20.391 --> 01:54:24.260
<v Speaker 4>I think within the next 15 to 20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people are going to start going back in</v>

2635
01:54:24.261 --> 01:54:29.000
<v Speaker 4>aging like legitimately they're going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>be able to not just slow down aging,</v>

2636
01:54:29.210 --> 01:54:32.780
<v Speaker 4>but we're going to see like 60 year old</v>
<v Speaker 4>ladies are hot as fuck.</v>

2637
01:54:33.290 --> 01:54:35.600
<v Speaker 4>We're going to see 60 year old ladies</v>
<v Speaker 4>looked at 32.</v>

2638
01:54:35.990 --> 01:54:38.810
<v Speaker 4>I really believe that I do to coming</v>
<v Speaker 4>around the corner.</v>

2639
01:54:38.930 --> 01:54:41.950
<v Speaker 4>Especially that guy who's talking about</v>
<v Speaker 4>that diabetic medicine that he takes</v>

2640
01:54:42.170 --> 01:54:43.340
<v Speaker 4>metformin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2641
01:54:43.730 --> 01:54:44.690
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But apparently,</v>

2642
01:54:44.691 --> 01:54:47.510
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that stuff has negative impacts on</v>

2643
01:54:47.540 --> 01:54:49.520
<v Speaker 4>athletic performance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's one of the things that I was</v>

2644
01:54:49.521 --> 01:54:53.120
<v Speaker 4>curious about when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when he discussed it and Dr Rhonda</v>

2645
01:54:53.120 --> 01:54:55.700
<v Speaker 4>Patrick sent me something on it and Ben</v>
<v Speaker 4>Greenfield actually brought it up on the</v>

2646
01:54:55.701 --> 01:54:56.180
<v Speaker 4>podcast.</v>

2647
01:54:56.180 --> 01:54:59.120
<v Speaker 4>We did a couple of days afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2648
01:54:59.121 --> 01:54:59.801
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2649
01:54:59.801 --> 01:55:00.410
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

2650
01:55:00.410 --> 01:55:02.540
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's probably good for longevity but not</v>

2651
01:55:02.541 --> 01:55:04.450
<v Speaker 4>good for athletic performance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a,</v>

2652
01:55:04.970 --> 01:55:08.150
<v Speaker 4>I'm not willing to make that sacrifice</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he's probably not really concerned</v>

2653
01:55:08.151 --> 01:55:09.530
<v Speaker 4>with athletic performance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2654
01:55:09.770 --> 01:55:11.840
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He barely worked out and he wasn't into</v>

2655
01:55:11.900 --> 01:55:13.700
<v Speaker 4>working out hard either.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was like his,</v>

2656
01:55:13.790 --> 01:55:16.430
<v Speaker 4>his deals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like just maintain a little bit of</v>

2657
01:55:16.431 --> 01:55:19.040
<v Speaker 4>exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just kind of keep the blood moving.</v>

2658
01:55:19.041 --> 01:55:24.041
<v Speaker 4>But a lot of those guys that are these</v>
<v Speaker 4>super genius sort of longevity experts,</v>

2659
01:55:27.440 --> 01:55:32.440
<v Speaker 4>they're just interested in how you can</v>
<v Speaker 4>slow the clock down as much as possible.</v>

2660
01:55:34.090 --> 01:55:38.990
<v Speaker 4>And then there's other people like Ben</v>
<v Speaker 4>Greenfield or like I'm Rhonda Patrick,</v>

2661
01:55:39.170 --> 01:55:42.260
<v Speaker 4>they're more interested in performance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what is,</v>

2662
01:55:42.261 --> 01:55:46.200
<v Speaker 4>what's the thing for you in terms of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for your mental performance,</v>

2663
01:55:46.201 --> 01:55:49.140
<v Speaker 4>physical performance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm more in line with that,</v>

2664
01:55:49.141 --> 01:55:50.940
<v Speaker 4>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm also,</v>

2665
01:55:51.030 --> 01:55:52.980
<v Speaker 4>I want to know what these guys are</v>
<v Speaker 4>working on.</v>

2666
01:55:53.770 --> 01:55:56.430
<v Speaker 4>The Davidson Claire's of the world</v>
<v Speaker 4>because he's at the top of the,</v>

2667
01:55:56.500 --> 01:55:58.230
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the tip of the spear when it comes to</v>

2668
01:55:58.231 --> 01:56:01.450
<v Speaker 4>longevity and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and gene editing and you know,</v>

2669
01:56:01.870 --> 01:56:06.870
<v Speaker 4>what they're talking about is being able</v>
<v Speaker 4>to inject certain what certain genes are</v>

2670
01:56:08.101 --> 01:56:10.020
<v Speaker 4>bacteria that carry genes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's going to fix it.</v>

2671
01:56:10.080 --> 01:56:11.300
<v Speaker 2>Eyesight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2672
01:56:11.360 --> 01:56:12.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>

2673
01:56:12.981 --> 01:56:14.860
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like people that are blind are going to</v>

2674
01:56:14.870 --> 01:56:16.490
<v Speaker 2>be able to see again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2675
01:56:16.610 --> 01:56:17.330
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2676
01:56:17.330 --> 01:56:22.330
<v Speaker 4>they're going to be able to do some mad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mad shit as long as human beings don't.</v>

2677
01:56:23.020 --> 01:56:27.130
<v Speaker 4>We don't figure out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean we don't nuke ourselves or fuck</v>

2678
01:56:27.131 --> 01:56:28.800
<v Speaker 4>the world to a point where,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2679
01:56:28.840 --> 01:56:32.020
<v Speaker 4>scientific research halts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If these guys can keep going,</v>

2680
01:56:32.740 --> 01:56:35.860
<v Speaker 4>if we can make it to the next 50 years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people are probably going to live to be</v>

2681
01:56:35.861 --> 01:56:36.790
<v Speaker 4>300 years old.</v>

2682
01:56:36.990 --> 01:56:37.990
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2684
01:56:40.600 --> 01:56:42.400
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How fucking smart people are going to be</v>

2685
01:56:42.401 --> 01:56:43.450
<v Speaker 2>at the 300.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2686
01:56:43.451 --> 01:56:45.490
<v Speaker 2>think about how smart you are compared</v>
<v Speaker 2>to when you were 20.</v>

2687
01:56:46.530 --> 01:56:49.240
<v Speaker 2>I was a dummy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So done.</v>

2688
01:56:49.940 --> 01:56:51.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm so dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm amazed.</v>

2689
01:56:51.161 --> 01:56:53.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm still here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I stop and think about how I used</v>

2690
01:56:53.741 --> 01:56:55.800
<v Speaker 2>to drive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll say,</v>

01:57:05.411 --> 01:57:08.860
<v Speaker 2>like old schools.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are safer at a couple of impalas.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what a like a,</v>

2728
01:58:21.940 --> 01:58:25.990
<v Speaker 2>not just a car but of window into time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2729
01:58:26.020 --> 01:58:29.050
<v Speaker 2>that's history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean back in 1941.</v>

2730
01:58:29.051 --> 01:58:30.760
<v Speaker 2>That's what people drove,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2731
01:58:30.761 --> 01:58:34.450
<v Speaker 2>That was the shit back then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People tooling around Manhattan and one</v>

2732
01:58:34.451 --> 01:58:35.131
<v Speaker 2>of those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2733
01:58:35.131 --> 01:58:36.450
<v Speaker 2>I love seeing those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2734
01:58:36.451 --> 01:58:40.210
<v Speaker 2>the movies that take place during those</v>
<v Speaker 2>timers and they find all those classics.</v>

2735
01:58:40.270 --> 01:58:41.290
<v Speaker 2>So cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2736
01:58:41.380 --> 01:58:44.170
<v Speaker 2>it was great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The more recent version of the great</v>

2737
01:58:44.171 --> 01:58:47.230
<v Speaker 2>gatsby with Leonardo Dicaprio when they</v>
<v Speaker 2>drove those cars,</v>

2738
01:58:47.231 --> 01:58:52.180
<v Speaker 2>but it was a weird movie because they</v>
<v Speaker 2>made those cars almost like modern.</v>

2739
01:58:52.520 --> 01:58:55.140
<v Speaker 2>It's very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how Romeo and Juliet was two.</v>

2740
01:58:55.150 --> 01:58:58.660
<v Speaker 2>The one with the one with Leonardo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm talking about.</v>

2741
01:58:58.661 --> 01:59:02.440
<v Speaker 2>Did you notice that all the guns in</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were super ill cars,</v>

2742
01:59:03.820 --> 01:59:04.360
<v Speaker 2>sick.</v>

2743
01:59:04.360 --> 01:59:05.980
<v Speaker 2>They do some futuristic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2744
01:59:05.981 --> 01:59:07.920
<v Speaker 2>Some weird interpretation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2745
01:59:08.130 --> 01:59:09.550
<v Speaker 2>a time period.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Correct,</v>

2746
01:59:09.551 --> 01:59:10.390
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2747
01:59:10.420 --> 01:59:12.130
<v Speaker 2>So that time period.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

2748
01:59:12.131 --> 01:59:15.550
<v Speaker 2>But when he drove that car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it drove like no fucking car.</v>

2749
01:59:15.990 --> 01:59:20.990
<v Speaker 2>Like cvs find a scene where he actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>drove the car because it sounded like it</v>

2750
01:59:21.971 --> 01:59:25.540
<v Speaker 2>was supercharged and it's flying and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's handling well,</v>

2751
01:59:25.541 --> 01:59:28.810
<v Speaker 2>but it's all like cartoonish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Almost like everything.</v>

2752
01:59:28.811 --> 01:59:32.050
<v Speaker 2>The scenes or like when they're driving</v>
<v Speaker 2>these cars,</v>

2753
01:59:32.290 --> 01:59:34.870
<v Speaker 2>they're nothing like those cars were</v>
<v Speaker 2>back then.</v>

2754
01:59:35.110 --> 01:59:36.460
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they don't move like that.</v>

2755
01:59:37.410 --> 01:59:38.880
<v Speaker 2>Especially in the road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2756
01:59:38.950 --> 01:59:41.380
<v Speaker 2>Unless you do like an ls swap and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>read everything.</v>

2757
01:59:41.620 --> 01:59:44.350
<v Speaker 2>Like when they're on the road,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like these fucking cars didn't drive</v>

2758
01:59:44.351 --> 01:59:45.910
<v Speaker 2>like that man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't.</v>

2759
01:59:45.970 --> 01:59:50.970
<v Speaker 2>They'd have skinny ass bullshit tires.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They barely could break.</v>

2760
01:59:51.190 --> 01:59:53.680
<v Speaker 2>You hit the brakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It took forever to slow down.</v>

2761
01:59:54.500 --> 01:59:57.340
<v Speaker 2>That was a great movie though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2762
01:59:57.341 --> 01:59:58.330
<v Speaker 2>those are sick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2763
01:59:58.331 --> 01:59:59.680
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all going sideways around</v>

2764
01:59:59.681 --> 02:00:01.660
<v Speaker 2>corners and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody did that back then.</v>

2765
02:00:02.910 --> 02:00:03.743
<v Speaker 2>It was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2766
02:00:03.860 --> 02:00:07.130
<v Speaker 2>It's weird how they do that with movies</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they have this like they're having</v>

2767
02:00:07.131 --> 02:00:09.290
<v Speaker 2>a race.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're racing.</v>

2768
02:00:09.330 --> 02:00:14.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean with that electric car outside</v>
<v Speaker 2>will follow by these motherfuckers show.</v>

2769
02:00:17.030 --> 02:00:21.500
<v Speaker 2>The problem with those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those Teslas is that once you get in one</v>

2770
02:00:22.160 --> 02:00:26.240
<v Speaker 2>other cars just seem kind of dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They seem kind of old.</v>

2771
02:00:26.540 --> 02:00:27.091
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet.</v>

2772
02:00:27.091 --> 02:00:29.590
<v Speaker 2>I feel like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're stepping into the future when you</v>

2773
02:00:29.610 --> 02:00:32.910
<v Speaker 2>drive those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything else wouldn't seem even up to</v>

2774
02:00:32.911 --> 02:00:33.744
<v Speaker 2>date,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2775
02:00:34.010 --> 02:00:38.330
<v Speaker 2>but there's something about cars like</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're 41 cadillac that have a theme to</v>

2776
02:00:38.331 --> 02:00:41.120
<v Speaker 2>them that you're never going to get from</v>
<v Speaker 2>a new car.</v>

2777
02:00:41.210 --> 02:00:43.670
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's cool about those is like when</v>

2778
02:00:43.671 --> 02:00:46.340
<v Speaker 2>you're in those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not concerned with whatever's on</v>

2779
02:00:46.341 --> 02:00:49.580
<v Speaker 2>the radio or talking on the phone or I</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know,</v>

2780
02:00:49.581 --> 02:00:53.570
<v Speaker 2>you're into just your content with just</v>
<v Speaker 2>hearing the car and driving.</v>

2781
02:00:53.570 --> 02:00:54.920
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>driving is fun.</v>

2782
02:00:54.960 --> 02:00:59.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas like if you're just in 2019</v>

2783
02:00:59.721 --> 02:01:01.670
<v Speaker 2>chevy truck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to feel like that,</v>

2784
02:01:01.671 --> 02:01:03.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you take it that far back.</v>

2785
02:01:03.561 --> 02:01:05.180
<v Speaker 2>Just the smell of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything.</v>

2786
02:01:05.181 --> 02:01:06.014
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

2787
02:01:06.080 --> 02:01:07.760
<v Speaker 2>it's a vibe and it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2788
02:01:08.240 --> 02:01:10.010
<v Speaker 2>You can't compare it to anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2789
02:01:10.011 --> 02:01:12.710
<v Speaker 2>When I bought my 65 corvette,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first thing I do is pull the radio</v>

2790
02:01:13.190 --> 02:01:14.390
<v Speaker 2>gear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That outta here.</v>

2791
02:01:14.391 --> 02:01:16.820
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to hear that radio is</v>
<v Speaker 2>unnecessarily.</v>

2792
02:01:16.850 --> 02:01:18.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to have those side pipes in the</v>

2793
02:01:18.891 --> 02:01:23.600
<v Speaker 2>wind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's going to be a thing of the</v>

2794
02:01:23.601 --> 02:01:24.434
<v Speaker 2>past.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

2795
02:01:24.770 --> 02:01:27.590
<v Speaker 2>I really firmly believe that now after</v>
<v Speaker 2>driving this car,</v>

2796
02:01:27.620 --> 02:01:29.990
<v Speaker 2>I think 50 years from now those things</v>
<v Speaker 2>are going to be.</v>

2797
02:01:30.340 --> 02:01:32.870
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be like seeing some guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>drive by on a model.</v>

2798
02:01:32.871 --> 02:01:35.600
<v Speaker 2>T engines are going to be a thing of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>past.</v>

2799
02:01:35.601 --> 02:01:37.340
<v Speaker 2>It's probably better for the environment</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyway.</v>

2800
02:01:37.550 --> 02:01:38.383
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

2801
02:01:40.880 --> 02:01:42.710
<v Speaker 4>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's it.</v>

2802
02:01:43.250 --> 02:01:44.720
<v Speaker 4>Let's wrap this up.</v>
