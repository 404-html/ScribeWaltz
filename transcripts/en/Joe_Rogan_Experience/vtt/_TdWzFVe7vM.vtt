00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:01.200
<v Speaker 1>Dah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dah,</v>

2
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.033
<v Speaker 1>Dah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dah.</v>

3
00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:06.480
<v Speaker 1>We are live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be the black bottle we're</v>

4
00:00:06.481 --> 00:00:08.730
<v Speaker 1>discussing how annoying it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>

5
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.570
<v Speaker 1>I listened to the podcast and episode</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I did with Whitney Cummings.</v>

6
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.470
<v Speaker 1>I was listening to it because it had the</v>
<v Speaker 1>long drive back from Irvine and I</v>

7
00:00:16.471 --> 00:00:18.690
<v Speaker 1>realized how annoying it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm always clearing my throat.</v>

8
00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.040
<v Speaker 1>I was telling Jamie he makes the best</v>
<v Speaker 1>butter coffee,</v>

9
00:00:23.041 --> 00:00:25.190
<v Speaker 1>but it's a stout batch and it gives you</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot.</v>

10
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.570
<v Speaker 1>A lot of butter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

11
00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.410
<v Speaker 1>it's good though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Taste goddamn good.</v>

12
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.750
<v Speaker 1>It's like a hug</v>
<v Speaker 1>hug.</v>

13
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.230
<v Speaker 1>Tate says about coffee tape from Quebec</v>
<v Speaker 1>or I'm coughing.</v>

14
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.780
<v Speaker 1>He says it's like a warm hug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>

15
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.230
<v Speaker 1>I was with Keith Jardine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

16
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.500
<v Speaker 1>I kind of ran into him at the airport</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we were where we were somewhere.</v>

17
00:00:46.501 --> 00:00:48.060
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember if he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to follow me.</v>

18
00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.961
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

19
00:00:48.961 --> 00:00:49.830
<v Speaker 1>I think that's just follow me.</v>

20
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.570
<v Speaker 1>There's a very special coffee place</v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

21
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:53.370
<v Speaker 1>And literally I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

22
00:00:53.371 --> 00:00:56.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where I'm going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we walked a mile,</v>

23
00:00:56.281 --> 00:01:01.170
<v Speaker 1>like airports brings me to this place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the one place they have very</v>

24
00:01:01.171 --> 00:01:03.290
<v Speaker 1>good coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it talks kind of like really Kinda</v>

25
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.880
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were closing and he said,</v>

26
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.950
<v Speaker 1>do you mind staying open just a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit longer?</v>

27
00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:09.990
<v Speaker 1>And the guy was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at his ears.</v>

28
00:01:09.991 --> 00:01:10.531
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

29
00:01:10.531 --> 00:01:11.420
<v Speaker 1>I suppose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

30
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.650
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll have a couple of these coffees.</v>

31
00:01:13.651 --> 00:01:16.620
<v Speaker 1>Police guy pushes the coffees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it was just so funny to watch</v>

32
00:01:16.621 --> 00:01:21.050
<v Speaker 1>this brute of a man sip the coffee with</v>
<v Speaker 1>such detail and,</v>

33
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.180
<v Speaker 1>and break down this taste.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

34
00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.160
<v Speaker 1>lot of citrus in this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like you're about to get</v>

35
00:01:26.161 --> 00:01:29.590
<v Speaker 1>raped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then I felt know,</v>

36
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.520
<v Speaker 1>but then I just suck this because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't really want to come with me.</v>

37
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.870
<v Speaker 1>Can you stay open?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't really want to just stay open.</v>

38
00:01:36.871 --> 00:01:40.530
<v Speaker 1>This weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to talk to you about</v>

39
00:01:40.531 --> 00:01:43.020
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody gives a fuck about flavor of</v>

40
00:01:43.021 --> 00:01:47.070
<v Speaker 1>coffee now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I want you to smell my breath after</v>

41
00:01:47.071 --> 00:01:48.770
<v Speaker 1>I drank it and get a little closer to my</v>
<v Speaker 1>mouth.</v>

42
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.290
<v Speaker 1>Now let's go ahead and drink deeply of</v>
<v Speaker 1>my lips.</v>

43
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:53.580
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for real though.</v>

47
00:01:58.921 --> 00:02:01.530
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we get done draining and he would take</v>

<v Speaker 1>off to a bookstore or a coffee shop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put on his glasses are just read and sip</v>

<v Speaker 1>you might be a piece of shit.</v>

<v Speaker 1>interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>humble guy who fucking loves coffee.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Sit here and he'll.</v>

61
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.390
<v Speaker 1>We'll do a podcast together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The motherfucker will down for Nitros.</v>

62
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.900
<v Speaker 1>Each nitrile is 270 milligrams of</v>
<v Speaker 1>caffeine.</v>

63
00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:40.580
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.270
<v Speaker 1>We're in this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're in this case.</v>

65
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.550
<v Speaker 1>Where were we at in Texas?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Dallas.</v>

66
00:02:44.551 --> 00:02:46.560
<v Speaker 1>We are one of his clubs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had our after parties.</v>

67
00:02:46.561 --> 00:02:48.000
<v Speaker 1>Honky tonk place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

68
00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:49.620
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was bro.</v>

69
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.260
<v Speaker 1>I have four kegs at night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

70
00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.250
<v Speaker 1>it's one in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was supposed to do with it.</v>

71
00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:57.840
<v Speaker 1>You go all night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

72
00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.380
<v Speaker 1>You don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's sober,</v>

73
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.980
<v Speaker 2>sober and he'll use a lot of butter in</v>
<v Speaker 2>that beard.</v>

74
00:03:02.981 --> 00:03:06.610
<v Speaker 2>He leaves a lot of butter in that beard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beard was not above grabbing me about</v>

75
00:03:06.611 --> 00:03:08.650
<v Speaker 2>the waste and pulling me right into his</v>
<v Speaker 2>lap.</v>

76
00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:12.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm sitting in your lap right now and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm afraid to move out of the way.</v>

77
00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.910
<v Speaker 2>She smells like a bookstore is like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>unique smell.</v>

78
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.320
<v Speaker 2>Like a hippie bookstore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

79
00:03:17.321 --> 00:03:21.770
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like wax and tattered cover.</v>

80
00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:23.400
<v Speaker 2>You call it the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

81
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.400
<v Speaker 2>I call it possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He smells like woodstock,</v>

82
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.930
<v Speaker 2>but see a lot of those dudes that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>sober and you know,</v>

83
00:03:31.931 --> 00:03:35.230
<v Speaker 2>I love Keith Keith tape to death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love both of them,</v>

84
00:03:35.231 --> 00:03:37.120
<v Speaker 2>but I love to death like tate's my</v>
<v Speaker 2>brother.</v>

85
00:03:37.121 --> 00:03:41.740
<v Speaker 2>I love that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does a lot of the alcoholics anonymous</v>

86
00:03:41.741 --> 00:03:43.840
<v Speaker 2>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any any sobriety guys?</v>

87
00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.480
<v Speaker 2>They drink a lot of pot of coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like,</v>

88
00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.640
<v Speaker 2>that's where they're getting their to</v>
<v Speaker 2>just get a little charge,</v>

89
00:03:48.641 --> 00:03:51.580
<v Speaker 2>a manageable charge that doesn't fuck up</v>
<v Speaker 2>your life,</v>

90
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:52.593
<v Speaker 2>but it gives you a little.</v>

91
00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:55.870
<v Speaker 2>They like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of them like cigarettes.</v>

92
00:03:55.871 --> 00:03:58.390
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Coffee and cigarettes together for</v>

93
00:03:58.391 --> 00:04:01.120
<v Speaker 2>alcoholics like my boys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you're doing.</v>

94
00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean I guess you're not ruining your</v>
<v Speaker 2>life in terms of decision making with</v>

95
00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:06.910
<v Speaker 2>the cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it would be with the booze in your</v>

96
00:04:06.911 --> 00:04:09.960
<v Speaker 2>body up though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Still a nicotine addiction more.</v>

97
00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.740
<v Speaker 2>It's replacing one addiction for</v>
<v Speaker 2>another.</v>

98
00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:13.780
<v Speaker 2>It depends on how much you're boozing</v>
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>

99
00:04:13.781 --> 00:04:15.160
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet you could kill yourself.</v>

100
00:04:15.161 --> 00:04:16.330
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could definitely kill yourself in</v>

101
00:04:16.331 --> 00:04:19.660
<v Speaker 2>one night with booze and you can't do</v>
<v Speaker 2>that with cigarettes.</v>

102
00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:22.870
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I guess it's more toxic to drunk.</v>

103
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.450
<v Speaker 2>A lot of those addicts become like</v>
<v Speaker 2>marathon runners because the endorphins</v>

104
00:04:26.451 --> 00:04:28.510
<v Speaker 2>that you get from running long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the same thing.</v>

105
00:04:28.511 --> 00:04:30.210
<v Speaker 2>So he get all skinny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was that.</v>

106
00:04:30.211 --> 00:04:34.570
<v Speaker 2>I was with Joe Schilling yesterday and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just so cool to watch that guy just</v>

107
00:04:34.571 --> 00:04:38.920
<v Speaker 2>light up to be just a world champion</v>
<v Speaker 2>kickboxer and then just smoke a</v>

108
00:04:38.921 --> 00:04:39.790
<v Speaker 2>cigarette once in a while.</v>

109
00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.950
<v Speaker 2>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so fucking tobacco.</v>

110
00:04:41.951 --> 00:04:45.070
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't fucking fuck with me man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll kick cancer into us.</v>

111
00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.860
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how long you been smoking goes since I</v>

112
00:04:47.861 --> 00:04:49.630
<v Speaker 2>was 12.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

113
00:04:49.631 --> 00:04:52.570
<v Speaker 2>It's unfortunate because I think it</v>
<v Speaker 2>slows them down a little bit.</v>

114
00:04:52.571 --> 00:04:56.050
<v Speaker 2>Joe's awesome even with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I definitely think it's a</v>

115
00:04:56.051 --> 00:04:58.180
<v Speaker 2>performance detriment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just is.</v>

116
00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.260
<v Speaker 2>If a sport relies on cardio is a huge</v>
<v Speaker 2>factor,</v>

117
00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.560
<v Speaker 2>why would you personally limit one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the biggest factors you could mean you</v>

118
00:05:08.201 --> 00:05:12.340
<v Speaker 2>can mitigate it somewhat with hard</v>
<v Speaker 2>training and a healthy lifestyle and</v>

119
00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.770
<v Speaker 2>moderation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Only smoke a few days.</v>

120
00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.430
<v Speaker 2>You can admit it may mitigate it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but think about a sport where people are</v>

121
00:05:18.431 --> 00:05:23.431
<v Speaker 2>trying so hard for little tiny fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>bumps have improved at that level.</v>

122
00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about one percent world champion.</v>

123
00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.620
<v Speaker 2>Like sometimes they hold on to zero</v>
<v Speaker 2>difference between.</v>

124
00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:33.130
<v Speaker 2>I mean the amount of decrease in</v>
<v Speaker 2>performance you would get from smoking</v>

125
00:05:33.131 --> 00:05:36.850
<v Speaker 2>cigarettes versus the amount of increase</v>
<v Speaker 2>in performance you could get from taking</v>

126
00:05:36.851 --> 00:05:37.890
<v Speaker 2>some things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

127
00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:41.380
<v Speaker 2>what's this shit they keep getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>popped with the Russian boxer just got</v>

128
00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:43.840
<v Speaker 2>blood wod Maloney.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

129
00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:45.030
<v Speaker 2>what is it called?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie?</v>

130
00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:46.450
<v Speaker 2>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See if you could find that please.</v>

131
00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:48.050
<v Speaker 2>It's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's called [inaudible].</v>

132
00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:51.950
<v Speaker 2>Like a version of EPO.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it raises your redlands Novinski</v>

133
00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:54.940
<v Speaker 2>explained it to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of Russian guys are getting</v>

134
00:05:54.941 --> 00:05:56.120
<v Speaker 2>caught with it all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

135
00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:57.960
<v Speaker 2>but here's the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is</v>

136
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.100
<v Speaker 3>what's important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was legal until December,</v>

137
00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:06.610
<v Speaker 3>but it's going back to Joe Schilling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is my only and I don't advocate</v>

138
00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:07.720
<v Speaker 3>smoking ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

139
00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.390
<v Speaker 3>My family members die from it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cancer,</v>

140
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.350
<v Speaker 3>all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But with Joe Schilling,</v>

141
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.200
<v Speaker 3>a guy like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if he smokes every now and then,</v>

142
00:06:15.201 --> 00:06:18.340
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how often he smoked him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If he's smoking cigarettes and it,</v>

143
00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.100
<v Speaker 3>it allows him to be more free and</v>
<v Speaker 3>creative inside the ring.</v>

144
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:26.920
<v Speaker 3>It's almost helping them because parents</v>
<v Speaker 3>were lime to be more creative.</v>

145
00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:28.940
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it calms his nerves.</v>

146
00:06:28.941 --> 00:06:32.150
<v Speaker 3>He's been doing it for so long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's such a good choice for them.</v>

147
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:34.940
<v Speaker 3>So it's almost the same thing with Jon</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jones.</v>

148
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.370
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can smoke a little weed and still be</v>

149
00:06:37.371 --> 00:06:39.140
<v Speaker 3>world champion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the baddest man on the planet.</v>

150
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:42.320
<v Speaker 3>We don't have to take all this winter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You gotta wear dockers and act like</v>

151
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:44.490
<v Speaker 3>God's child.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

152
00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:49.540
<v Speaker 3>I've seen people who have to be very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very specific and correct and intense in</v>

153
00:06:49.741 --> 00:06:53.000
<v Speaker 3>something a lot of times the way they</v>
<v Speaker 3>manage that stress,</v>

154
00:06:53.001 --> 00:06:56.720
<v Speaker 3>the stress of competition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the stress of living up to expectations</v>

155
00:06:56.721 --> 00:07:00.320
<v Speaker 3>is they have one vice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They typically will give themselves a</v>

156
00:07:00.321 --> 00:07:02.690
<v Speaker 3>recess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most smoking girls,</v>

157
00:07:02.691 --> 00:07:05.510
<v Speaker 3>whatever it might be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Human beings tend to do that more than</v>

158
00:07:05.511 --> 00:07:07.730
<v Speaker 3>they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most athletes don't and I would say that</v>

159
00:07:07.731 --> 00:07:10.760
<v Speaker 3>was my biggest problem was I had to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything had to go.</v>

160
00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:12.890
<v Speaker 3>It had to be mapped out to be written</v>
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>

161
00:07:12.891 --> 00:07:16.610
<v Speaker 3>plan for plan minute by minute and if</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything went wrong I freaked out and I</v>

162
00:07:16.611 --> 00:07:20.090
<v Speaker 3>always wish I was more of that maverick</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe Schilling maybe have a cigarette,</v>

163
00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:22.670
<v Speaker 3>maybe go crash a Bentley with hookers</v>
<v Speaker 3>and cocaine,</v>

164
00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:27.170
<v Speaker 3>but don't you think that that's maybe</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the cigarettes aren't necessary.</v>

165
00:07:27.171 --> 00:07:31.520
<v Speaker 3>It's the attitude behind the choice to</v>
<v Speaker 3>make cigarettes part of your life.</v>

166
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:32.870
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what's necessary.</v>

167
00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:35.120
<v Speaker 3>Like that was made though when he was</v>
<v Speaker 3>much younger.</v>

168
00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:37.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he doesn't have to continue that</v>

169
00:07:37.041 --> 00:07:40.010
<v Speaker 3>pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very destructive lot.</v>

170
00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.260
<v Speaker 3>Like I noticed now we've talked about</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

171
00:07:42.261 --> 00:07:43.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I know he's.</v>

172
00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:46.490
<v Speaker 3>He's tried to stop me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's tried to stop when there is my</v>

173
00:07:46.491 --> 00:07:48.410
<v Speaker 3>feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you try to stop something,</v>

174
00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:52.070
<v Speaker 3>it means you want to stop something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so if you try to stop and then you don't</v>

175
00:07:52.071 --> 00:07:53.960
<v Speaker 3>stop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that means it beat your ass.</v>

176
00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:57.350
<v Speaker 3>Like that is an important part of your</v>
<v Speaker 3>life where you can,</v>

177
00:07:57.351 --> 00:07:59.750
<v Speaker 3>when you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're in a competition with</v>

178
00:07:59.751 --> 00:08:03.470
<v Speaker 3>yourself and you can win and you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is my feeling about this and I'm</v>

179
00:08:03.471 --> 00:08:05.600
<v Speaker 3>not trying to be hard on people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think this is an important</v>

180
00:08:05.601 --> 00:08:08.300
<v Speaker 3>distinction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you fail yourself,</v>

181
00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:12.410
<v Speaker 3>when you decide to yourself that you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to take care of something and</v>

182
00:08:12.411 --> 00:08:14.270
<v Speaker 3>you're going to kick an addiction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to do something and you</v>

183
00:08:14.271 --> 00:08:15.080
<v Speaker 3>don't do it.</v>

184
00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:18.950
<v Speaker 3>You don't like yourself as much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess one of the most important things</v>

185
00:08:18.951 --> 00:08:23.780
<v Speaker 3>about accomplishments and about</v>
<v Speaker 3>overcoming bad things in your life.</v>

186
00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:27.260
<v Speaker 3>If you have something you're doing like</v>
<v Speaker 3>smoking cigarettes and you don't kick</v>

187
00:08:27.261 --> 00:08:29.870
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you won't respect yourself the same.</v>

188
00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.090
<v Speaker 3>The only thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only thing I would say though is</v>

189
00:08:32.091 --> 00:08:37.091
<v Speaker 3>that sometimes liking yourself isn't so</v>
<v Speaker 3>important for accomplishing great</v>

190
00:08:38.571 --> 00:08:40.720
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are a lot of people that would is</v>

191
00:08:40.721 --> 00:08:42.150
<v Speaker 3>for happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

192
00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:42.981
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

193
00:08:42.981 --> 00:08:45.530
<v Speaker 3>sometimes happiness can be the great</v>
<v Speaker 3>stopper.</v>

194
00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:46.940
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like Harriet door.</v>

195
00:08:46.941 --> 00:08:48.080
<v Speaker 3>When she wanted the book award,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they said,</v>

196
00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:49.940
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you happy being a housewife for 35</v>

197
00:08:49.941 --> 00:08:50.631
<v Speaker 3>years?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she said,</v>

198
00:08:50.631 --> 00:08:52.370
<v Speaker 3>why would anybody was happy write a</v>
<v Speaker 3>book.</v>

199
00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:54.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that you have to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>suffering,</v>

200
00:08:54.531 --> 00:08:55.950
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of times</v>

201
00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:00.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that being satisfied,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having peace of mind and and even being</v>

202
00:09:00.961 --> 00:09:03.180
<v Speaker 1>happy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which of course we all are striving for</v>

203
00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:08.490
<v Speaker 1>sometimes that can be a hindrance to</v>
<v Speaker 1>what got you where you are in the first</v>

204
00:09:10.471 --> 00:09:12.140
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm speaking primarily a lot of</v>

205
00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:14.340
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of great books,</v>

206
00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:18.410
<v Speaker 1>screenplays,</v>
<v Speaker 1>films made by smoke and and so,</v>

207
00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:19.890
<v Speaker 1>so in that sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

208
00:09:19.891 --> 00:09:21.540
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when it comes to addiction,</v>

209
00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:24.540
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that they've found</v>
<v Speaker 1>that way easier to deal with.</v>

210
00:09:24.541 --> 00:09:25.520
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

211
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:29.550
<v Speaker 1>stop smoking because it'll kill you or</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop smoking because it makes no sense</v>

212
00:09:29.551 --> 00:09:30.840
<v Speaker 1>or stopped throwing because you're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>disciplined.</v>

213
00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:34.260
<v Speaker 1>That tends to not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That might work for a short period of</v>

214
00:09:34.261 --> 00:09:35.730
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people always go back to their set</v>

215
00:09:35.731 --> 00:09:39.510
<v Speaker 1>point and what does work better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you should say always</v>

216
00:09:39.511 --> 00:09:40.560
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of people quit.</v>

217
00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:41.770
<v Speaker 1>They do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what?</v>

218
00:09:41.771 --> 00:09:43.860
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What helps with quitting from what I</v>

219
00:09:43.861 --> 00:09:48.420
<v Speaker 1>have read and what I've talked to and</v>
<v Speaker 1>even in my own experience is that you</v>

220
00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:53.421
<v Speaker 1>have to start associating the act of</v>
<v Speaker 1>smoking or whatever your vice might be</v>

221
00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:59.510
<v Speaker 1>with something negative and associating</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even feeling the difference.</v>

222
00:09:59.791 --> 00:10:01.140
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always say about people that want to</v>

223
00:10:01.141 --> 00:10:02.580
<v Speaker 1>get in shape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you could feel.</v>

224
00:10:02.581 --> 00:10:05.070
<v Speaker 1>If people are out of shape and eat a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>and eat food,</v>

225
00:10:05.071 --> 00:10:07.800
<v Speaker 1>if they could feel how much better they</v>
<v Speaker 1>they feel.</v>

226
00:10:07.801 --> 00:10:09.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm just talking about the pleasure</v>
<v Speaker 1>principle.</v>

227
00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:12.270
<v Speaker 1>They could feel what it's like to be in</v>
<v Speaker 1>shape.</v>

228
00:10:12.271 --> 00:10:15.540
<v Speaker 1>I think they'd have a heart easier time</v>
<v Speaker 1>going over that road to get there.</v>

229
00:10:15.541 --> 00:10:18.330
<v Speaker 1>There'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you won't realize how good you feel</v>

230
00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:21.140
<v Speaker 1>smoke until,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the withdrawals and it's gonna</v>

231
00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:25.260
<v Speaker 1>take forever to get through that point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a hard point to argue and I</v>

232
00:10:25.261 --> 00:10:26.520
<v Speaker 1>don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've obviously,</v>

233
00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.690
<v Speaker 1>but some people who have smoked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Ari said to this day,</v>

234
00:10:30.691 --> 00:10:32.400
<v Speaker 1>he quit years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>still think what he said.</v>

235
00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:33.780
<v Speaker 1>He still gets an itch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

236
00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:35.540
<v Speaker 1>you'll see people smoking and we'll go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

237
00:10:35.541 --> 00:10:38.310
<v Speaker 1>it looks good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it is a powerful,</v>

238
00:10:38.311 --> 00:10:41.220
<v Speaker 1>powerful drug guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like schilling can't kick it.</v>

239
00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.290
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he wants to bad enough,</v>

240
00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:45.510
<v Speaker 1>but also with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with this Kito Diet,</v>

241
00:10:45.511 --> 00:10:48.420
<v Speaker 1>I stopped all sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't walk by Mrs Fields.</v>

242
00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.490
<v Speaker 1>Don't welcome me by Mrs. Fields that</v>
<v Speaker 1>will freak the fuck out.</v>

243
00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:54.390
<v Speaker 1>So it's back now because for a while you</v>
<v Speaker 1>were saying you don't even,</v>

244
00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:57.350
<v Speaker 1>you don't even crave it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's only if I go by Mrs. Fields like I</v>

245
00:10:57.351 --> 00:11:00.150
<v Speaker 1>was at the mall with my brother and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was literally like,</v>

246
00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:03.620
<v Speaker 1>Oh Dang son,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me take my wall here.</v>

247
00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:05.180
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

248
00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:08.340
<v Speaker 1>it causes more of it if you go the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mentality of scarcity.</v>

249
00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:10.980
<v Speaker 1>So if you start thinking this is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>last cookie on the planet,</v>

250
00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:11.843
<v Speaker 1>you're going to go for it.</v>

251
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:14.040
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it slows your metabolism down.</v>

252
00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:16.650
<v Speaker 1>You know when you start going into</v>
<v Speaker 1>scarcity mode,</v>

253
00:11:16.651 --> 00:11:19.560
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the things that they say</v>
<v Speaker 1>about people that were incorrectly</v>

254
00:11:19.561 --> 00:11:21.630
<v Speaker 1>starving themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you'll have like a little tiny</v>

255
00:11:21.631 --> 00:11:24.720
<v Speaker 1>portions of carbs and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then your body's like,</v>

256
00:11:24.721 --> 00:11:28.470
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And your body slows down because it's</v>

257
00:11:28.471 --> 00:11:31.140
<v Speaker 1>worried about losing resources because</v>
<v Speaker 1>no foods coming in.</v>

258
00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.120
<v Speaker 1>They can actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

259
00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:36.480
<v Speaker 1>your metabolism slows down a hanging</v>
<v Speaker 1>onto this shit.</v>

260
00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:40.890
<v Speaker 1>The only way like fasting is good is</v>
<v Speaker 1>when your body is in Ketosis because</v>

261
00:11:40.891 --> 00:11:44.580
<v Speaker 1>then your body just starts burning fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fucked up thing about addictions is</v>

262
00:11:44.581 --> 00:11:46.620
<v Speaker 1>that this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a evolutionary biologist,</v>

263
00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:50.190
<v Speaker 1>his name escapes me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was talking about how the fact that if</v>

264
00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:53.740
<v Speaker 1>like an addictive mindset,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are extreme,</v>

265
00:11:53.741 --> 00:11:54.220
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who</v>

266
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:56.020
<v Speaker 3>need a lot of food for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or whatever,</v>

267
00:11:56.410 --> 00:12:00.220
<v Speaker 3>that kind of mindset actually served our</v>
<v Speaker 3>ancestors,</v>

268
00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:03.370
<v Speaker 3>cave men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea of finding,</v>

269
00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:06.610
<v Speaker 3>pinpointing what you want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is that deer and running after it</v>

270
00:12:06.611 --> 00:12:09.940
<v Speaker 3>for three days until it falls over and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

271
00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:12.760
<v Speaker 3>that need,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that sort of left brain.</v>

272
00:12:12.761 --> 00:12:14.950
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it's the problem is when you take</v>

273
00:12:14.951 --> 00:12:17.060
<v Speaker 3>away the fact that you have to chase the</v>
<v Speaker 3>deer for three,</v>

274
00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:19.200
<v Speaker 3>three days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you that,</v>

275
00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:23.500
<v Speaker 3>that we still have a lot of that</v>
<v Speaker 3>reptilian sort of caveman mentality and</v>

276
00:12:23.501 --> 00:12:28.501
<v Speaker 3>the most successful people in those</v>
<v Speaker 3>societies now will tend to be the same</v>

277
00:12:29.081 --> 00:12:32.110
<v Speaker 3>people that have the same insane drive</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get,</v>

278
00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:34.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do all the cocaine or eat all the food</v>

279
00:12:34.781 --> 00:12:36.400
<v Speaker 3>or drink all the alcohol or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>

280
00:12:36.401 --> 00:12:38.680
<v Speaker 3>or the the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or the addictive to,</v>

281
00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:41.580
<v Speaker 3>to working out or to their sport.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then those,</v>

282
00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:43.120
<v Speaker 3>most times those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>

283
00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these people.</v>

284
00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:46.300
<v Speaker 3>So to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those world,</v>

285
00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:48.270
<v Speaker 3>those elite of the elite,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the one percenters,</v>

286
00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:52.570
<v Speaker 3>they're not the funds to hang out with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of them are not the guy like</v>

287
00:12:52.571 --> 00:12:54.430
<v Speaker 3>Michael Jordan used to say that Michael</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jordan,</v>

288
00:12:54.431 --> 00:12:57.230
<v Speaker 3>if you beat him playing ping pong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wouldn't talk to you for two weeks.</v>

289
00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:59.650
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking be angry at you.</v>

290
00:12:59.651 --> 00:13:01.570
<v Speaker 3>It was fun to hang out with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

291
00:13:01.571 --> 00:13:06.250
<v Speaker 3>and that's what produces that intense</v>
<v Speaker 3>level of focus that creates a guy like</v>

292
00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:08.500
<v Speaker 3>Michael Jordan and they still don't like</v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves though.</v>

293
00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:11.500
<v Speaker 3>There's a little bit of that in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the question becomes,</v>

294
00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:14.590
<v Speaker 3>do you want to be happy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you want to be healthy or do you just</v>

295
00:13:14.591 --> 00:13:16.990
<v Speaker 3>want to be successful?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like do you want to be like some</v>

296
00:13:16.991 --> 00:13:19.540
<v Speaker 3>miserable person?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's laden with addictions that you may</v>

297
00:13:19.541 --> 00:13:23.260
<v Speaker 3>or may not be managing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that is creating some success.</v>

298
00:13:23.261 --> 00:13:25.570
<v Speaker 3>Like in the form of art,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like maybe music or something like that.</v>

299
00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:27.190
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of musicians,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's.</v>

300
00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:31.240
<v Speaker 3>There's an argument for that versus like</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bet nickelback eat a lot of Vegan</v>

301
00:13:31.241 --> 00:13:32.650
<v Speaker 3>food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look man,</v>

302
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:37.560
<v Speaker 3>my told him</v>
<v Speaker 3>bring water.</v>

303
00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:40.570
<v Speaker 3>I bet they get up early and do yoga so</v>
<v Speaker 3>much.</v>

304
00:13:40.571 --> 00:13:41.890
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They dropped some hips,</v>

305
00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:46.000
<v Speaker 3>have some songs I enjoy here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have that one.</v>

306
00:13:46.001 --> 00:13:48.490
<v Speaker 3>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's that one song that everybody has</v>

307
00:13:48.491 --> 00:13:49.700
<v Speaker 3>song,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was.</v>

308
00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:51.391
<v Speaker 3>Listen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

309
00:13:51.391 --> 00:13:51.820
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

310
00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:53.650
<v Speaker 3>It's the theme.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Rock Star Song.</v>

311
00:13:53.651 --> 00:13:56.140
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm a rockstar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's like the fucking,</v>

312
00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.240
<v Speaker 3>my favorite version of the Cypress Hill</v>
<v Speaker 3>version.</v>

313
00:13:58.290 --> 00:14:00.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your mind to be a rock star.</v>

314
00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:02.850
<v Speaker 3>That's the shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

315
00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:06.100
<v Speaker 3>That's the best version of the back</v>
<v Speaker 3>superstars back's got.</v>

316
00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:10.870
<v Speaker 3>They got their own version of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of those are never good song.</v>

317
00:14:10.871 --> 00:14:14.800
<v Speaker 3>Unfortunately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd love to sample the sample up</v>

318
00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:21.070
<v Speaker 3>broken nickelback song.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's.</v>

319
00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:23.560
<v Speaker 3>There is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's something that I think we</v>

320
00:14:23.561 --> 00:14:28.561
<v Speaker 3>all recognize about what they did is</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there's just something sort of</v>

321
00:14:31.121 --> 00:14:34.330
<v Speaker 3>disingenuous or something contrived or</v>
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>

322
00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:35.990
<v Speaker 3>but it's still good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me see.</v>

323
00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:39.400
<v Speaker 3>Let me see if I think they're almost</v>
<v Speaker 3>fake.</v>

324
00:14:39.401 --> 00:14:40.234
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the.</v>

325
00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:41.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I can't be friends.</v>

326
00:14:41.531 --> 00:14:45.830
<v Speaker 3>I think they're fake at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I think Ben just to.</v>

327
00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:50.680
<v Speaker 3>They're successful and I think a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>dumb people like them.</v>

328
00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:51.763
<v Speaker 3>It's not that they're</v>

329
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:53.690
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they are good.</v>

330
00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:57.710
<v Speaker 1>I think that a lot you get associated</v>
<v Speaker 1>with some of your fans.</v>

331
00:14:57.711 --> 00:15:01.310
<v Speaker 1>There's that and someone started picking</v>
<v Speaker 1>on them and using them as a punchline</v>

332
00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:05.510
<v Speaker 1>and then it became that punch line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Catches fire is like,</v>

333
00:15:05.511 --> 00:15:09.050
<v Speaker 1>look at all the bad musical artists and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say bad,</v>

334
00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:12.530
<v Speaker 1>obviously tasted suggests subjective and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just talking about my opinion,</v>

335
00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:16.070
<v Speaker 1>which is my taste for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so much shit out there,</v>

336
00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:19.010
<v Speaker 1>but people love it and it doesn't become</v>
<v Speaker 1>a punchline.</v>

337
00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:22.030
<v Speaker 1>Like nickelback became a punchline for</v>
<v Speaker 1>white dude.</v>

338
00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:27.040
<v Speaker 1>It's a little too good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael had Fox fluxion Bolton was</v>

339
00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:32.390
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael was saying I became a punchline.</v>

340
00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:35.360
<v Speaker 1>Michael Bolton was saying I was just</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing music and all of a sudden like the</v>

341
00:15:35.361 --> 00:15:38.060
<v Speaker 1>right people started making fun of me</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the guy with the hair.</v>

342
00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:40.130
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they said people started making fun</v>

343
00:15:40.131 --> 00:15:42.380
<v Speaker 1>of me and I and it just caught fire and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

344
00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:43.790
<v Speaker 1>shit literally became.</v>

345
00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:46.640
<v Speaker 1>I was just writing my music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had long hair and he had like a</v>

346

00:19:04.111 --> 00:19:08.400
<v Speaker 3>incorporating wrestling and submissions.</v>

<v Speaker 3>in on randy for five rounds.</v>

<v Speaker 3>and I'm trying to hold mitts.</v>

<v Speaker 3>This dude fucked me up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean go hit me in the chin nose.</v>

484
00:21:45.701 --> 00:21:46.534
<v Speaker 3>whatever he wants.</v>

485
00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:50.380
<v Speaker 3>This dude fucked me up every round like</v>
<v Speaker 3>god damn iT.</v>

486
00:21:50.381 --> 00:21:53.190
<v Speaker 3>So he wants you to hit pads and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>shoot doubles and you know,</v>

487
00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:56.080
<v Speaker 3>he's gonna shoot doubles on you and take</v>
<v Speaker 3>you down and hit you as well.</v>

488
00:21:56.081 --> 00:21:57.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was like doing this setup where he</v>

489
00:21:57.971 --> 00:21:58.750
<v Speaker 3>would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

490
00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:02.500
<v Speaker 3>it was like a straight right left hook</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then get in on a single leg and I</v>

491
00:22:02.501 --> 00:22:03.460
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>god man,</v>

492
00:22:03.461 --> 00:22:04.030
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

493
00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:07.730
<v Speaker 3>when you come in and strike and I feel</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you're open for it because his</v>

494
00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:08.471
<v Speaker 3>setup,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

495
00:22:08.471 --> 00:22:09.170
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>random.</v>

496
00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:12.180
<v Speaker 3>I didn't train them before that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I didn't feel like I was in the</v>

497
00:22:12.181 --> 00:22:15.550
<v Speaker 3>position to say anything because I feel</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you're opening yourself up with</v>

498
00:22:15.551 --> 00:22:17.230
<v Speaker 3>liotta man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not going to be there.</v>

<v Speaker 3>LIke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're coming straight at him.</v>

500
00:22:18.521 --> 00:22:20.490
<v Speaker 3>He's not going to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I told his coach them,</v>

501
00:22:20.491 --> 00:22:21.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

502
00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:22.180
<v Speaker 3>he got this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

503
00:22:22.181 --> 00:22:22.750
<v Speaker 3>he's been there before.</v>

504
00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:23.081
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

505
00:22:23.081 --> 00:22:23.740
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Training,</v>

506
00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:25.080
<v Speaker 3>couture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pan,</v>

507
00:22:25.081 --> 00:22:30.081
<v Speaker 3>watching the fight tooth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He got knocked out like way to go shop.</v>

508
00:22:32.021 --> 00:22:33.430
<v Speaker 3>You're the son of a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jumping,</v>

509
00:22:33.431 --> 00:22:35.560
<v Speaker 3>jumping front kick is what I meant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was.</v>

510
00:22:35.561 --> 00:22:36.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly what it was.</v>

511
00:22:36.611 --> 00:22:39.100
<v Speaker 3>I was in toronto.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the biggest event ever.</v>

512
00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:42.020
<v Speaker 3>How about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how about when Jack Wright did to a</v>

513
00:22:42.410 --> 00:22:43.720
<v Speaker 3>vitara this weekend?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Damn.</v>

514
00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:45.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a monster.</v>

515
00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:46.600
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that was very surprising</v>
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>

516
00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:47.593
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

517
00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:50.020
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the vittorio you're looking at,</v>

518
00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:51.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this tour that you're looking at right</v>

519
00:22:51.971 --> 00:22:55.510
<v Speaker 3>now is with diminished hormone levels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>30 nine off,</v>

520
00:22:55.900 --> 00:23:00.610
<v Speaker 3>which going to has legs look so skinny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ennis asked wasn't there and you can't.</v>

521
00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:04.150
<v Speaker 3>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's like there's only so much your</v>

522
00:23:04.151 --> 00:23:09.151
<v Speaker 3>body can do if you're not supplementing</v>
<v Speaker 3>your hormones after a certain age and</v>

523
00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:14.340
<v Speaker 3>when you see guys that fucked with</v>
<v Speaker 3>steroids most of their life and then</v>

524
00:23:14.801 --> 00:23:16.300
<v Speaker 3>tried to operate off of them.</v>

525
00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:20.170
<v Speaker 3>You have real problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just kickstarting your endocrine system.</v>

526
00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:21.910
<v Speaker 3>Stefan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>employee overeem,</v>

527
00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:24.700
<v Speaker 3>testing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's up?</v>

528
00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:25.630
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's.</v>

529
00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:29.020
<v Speaker 3>He's figured out a way to get down to</v>
<v Speaker 3>240 pounds.</v>

530
00:23:29.021 --> 00:23:31.270
<v Speaker 3>He's younger a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then first of all,</v>

531
00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:34.330
<v Speaker 3>but he's figured out a way to get down</v>
<v Speaker 3>to 2:40 and maybe it doesn't have as</v>

532
00:23:34.331 --> 00:23:37.270
<v Speaker 3>much power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who I think when he's realizing now is</v>

533
00:23:37.271 --> 00:23:41.940
<v Speaker 3>technically like as a striker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he has had a fucking very high level,</v>

534
00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:45.740
<v Speaker 3>more technical than anyone use the same</v>
<v Speaker 3>mistakes.</v>

535
00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:49.160
<v Speaker 3>He's made mistakes in some of his fights</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the mistakes in his approaches.</v>

536
00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:53.420
<v Speaker 3>Mistakes in like how big he tried to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>or running out of gas.</v>

537
00:23:53.421 --> 00:23:56.660
<v Speaker 3>Like in the travis brown fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When travis caught him with that front</v>

538
00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:59.670
<v Speaker 3>kick to the face,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would try to finish guys off and they</v>

539
00:23:59.671 --> 00:24:03.130
<v Speaker 3>didn't finish that guys off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'd kind of be fucked and they'll land</v>

540
00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:03.690
<v Speaker 3>on skills.</v>

541
00:24:03.690 --> 00:24:06.860
<v Speaker 3>there's also with winkeljohn that that</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking jackson team,</v>

542
00:24:06.861 --> 00:24:08.660
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of great people for him to</v>

543
00:24:08.661 --> 00:24:10.210
<v Speaker 3>train with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's really skills.</v>

544
00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:14.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying now that he's one of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys where you see drug testing kick in</v>

545
00:24:14.871 --> 00:24:16.640
<v Speaker 3>and obviously he looks completely</v>
<v Speaker 3>different,</v>

546
00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:21.500
<v Speaker 3>but now he has to adapt the way fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has more skills in the heavyweight</v>

547
00:24:21.501 --> 00:24:23.000
<v Speaker 3>division thAn anyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When it comes striking.</v>

548
00:24:23.790 --> 00:24:26.700
<v Speaker 3>It's not even close to grand prix.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wanted the grant</v>

549
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.550
<v Speaker 3>technique is so fun to watch and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>donald,</v>

550
00:24:31.551 --> 00:24:33.650
<v Speaker 3>we'll spar with them and says he just</v>
<v Speaker 3>learns.</v>

551
00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:36.500
<v Speaker 3>Watching the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is what I'm saying is he's a</v>

552
00:24:36.501 --> 00:24:39.170
<v Speaker 3>guy where this strict drug tests testing</v>
<v Speaker 3>kicks in.</v>

553
00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:42.230
<v Speaker 3>You can see a physical change and he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>still doing well.</v>

554
00:24:42.231 --> 00:24:43.880
<v Speaker 3>He's better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's better in fights.</v>

555
00:24:43.881 --> 00:24:45.050
<v Speaker 3>More cautiously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't ask.</v>

556
00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:47.120
<v Speaker 3>He's fighting really smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd say smarter,</v>

557
00:24:47.121 --> 00:24:47.750
<v Speaker 3>not cautiously.</v>

558
00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:50.420
<v Speaker 3>wastewater [inaudible] used to come in</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a meathead because he has so much</v>

559
00:24:50.421 --> 00:24:51.230
<v Speaker 3>power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

560
00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:54.440
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that allowed him to get clipped and</v>

561
00:24:54.441 --> 00:24:56.340
<v Speaker 3>I think that when you're seeing them</v>
<v Speaker 3>fight now,</v>

562
00:24:56.341 --> 00:25:00.590
<v Speaker 3>like especially perfect examples,</v>
<v Speaker 3>junior dos santos like he not junior dos</v>

563
00:25:00.591 --> 00:25:03.080
<v Speaker 3>santos and a lot of people like god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe juniors,</v>

564
00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:04.480
<v Speaker 3>maybe he's done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

565
00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:07.080
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's just not the same anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then junior comes back and bites</v>

566
00:25:07.081 --> 00:25:09.470
<v Speaker 3>brand ben rothwell it looks better than</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's ever looked.</v>

567
00:25:09.471 --> 00:25:11.450
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So junior looked fantastic and then you</v>

568
00:25:11.451 --> 00:25:12.320
<v Speaker 3>realize,</v>

618
00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:24.250

<v Speaker 3>It's striking is no fucking joke for.</v>

619
00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:27.150
<v Speaker 3>It was really good too because He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he did a lot of box and had good</v>

620
00:27:27.151 --> 00:27:28.680
<v Speaker 3>defense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Beat the fuck out of over him,</v>

623
00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:37.440
<v Speaker 3>running away from him and then he folds</v>
<v Speaker 3>against them and then when they fought</v>

624
00:27:37.441 --> 00:27:39.210
<v Speaker 3>strikeforce,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just never moved him over.</v>

625

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess not.</v>

626
00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:43.550
<v Speaker 3>I wonder what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he had some injuries for awhile</v>

627
00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:43.800
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

628
00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:45.420
<v Speaker 3>I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe he had some,</v>

629
00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:48.160
<v Speaker 3>some issues and he gained a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>weight beCause of it.</v>

630
00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:49.550
<v Speaker 3>remember he got like real heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

631
00:27:49.630 --> 00:27:52.080
<v Speaker 3>Because he lost in the heavyweight grand</v>
<v Speaker 3>prix.</v>

632
00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:57.030
<v Speaker 3>That [inaudible] he was in that he lost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you think is going to happen?</v>

633
00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:59.850
<v Speaker 3>I won't say barnett.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

634
00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:00.743
<v Speaker 3>And barnett?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Beto.</v>

635
00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:04.350
<v Speaker 3>Jimmy am I going crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember that fight.</v>

636
00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:08.880
<v Speaker 3>What do you think is going to happen</v>
<v Speaker 3>when steve pay fights over?</v>

637
00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:10.860
<v Speaker 3>That's next one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hundred percent.</v>

638
00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:14.200
<v Speaker 3>If you look at their scheduling to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>boat,</v>

639
00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:17.250
<v Speaker 3>they both fall around the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Overeem's next.</v>

640
00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:19.620
<v Speaker 3>He's won four in a row.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's the guy for the job.</v>

641
00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:22.170
<v Speaker 3>they're both there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tHink you have to wait until travis</v>

642
00:28:22.171 --> 00:28:24.570
<v Speaker 3>browne fights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm cain velasquez,</v>

643
00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:26.820
<v Speaker 3>I think when cain button,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is my thought.</v>

644
00:28:27.150 --> 00:28:30.420
<v Speaker 3>Cain velasquez,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if he beats travis brown and some</v>

645
00:28:30.421 --> 00:28:33.090
<v Speaker 3>spectacular way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to be calling for him to</v>

646
00:28:33.091 --> 00:28:33.810
<v Speaker 3>fight for the title.</v>

647
00:28:33.810 --> 00:28:38.700
<v Speaker 3>That's the toughest fight I think for me</v>
<v Speaker 3>only because travis will be in his grill</v>

648
00:28:38.970 --> 00:28:41.850
<v Speaker 3>if it's for healthy travel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

649
00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:46.530
<v Speaker 3>if cain is in shape and that cardio</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing and just in his grill boxing,</v>

650
00:28:46.650 --> 00:28:50.010
<v Speaker 3>getting close and wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hit the better east probably at least</v>

651
00:28:50.011 --> 00:28:53.210
<v Speaker 3>as good a wrestler or a better wrestler</v>
<v Speaker 3>than state back.</v>

652
00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:58.220
<v Speaker 3>Cain is overwHelming as</v>
<v Speaker 3>fighters I suppose as a person who's</v>

653
00:28:59.611 --> 00:29:03.570
<v Speaker 3>watched fighters my whole life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like watching the ufc,</v>

654
00:29:03.571 --> 00:29:06.810
<v Speaker 3>all the thousands of fights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd never seen a heavyweight that can</v>

655
00:29:06.811 --> 00:29:08.770
<v Speaker 3>put the kind of pressure on somebody</v>
<v Speaker 3>that came care.</v>

656
00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:11.910
<v Speaker 3>He's just different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His cardio is just different.</v>

657
00:29:11.911 --> 00:29:14.100
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like he's got double lungs.</v>

658
00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:16.120
<v Speaker 3>I'm not even joking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maps.</v>

659
00:29:16.390 --> 00:29:19.290
<v Speaker 3>I've been overwhelmed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Watching his fights can be an argument.</v>

660
00:29:19.291 --> 00:29:21.030
<v Speaker 3>He's number one best heavyweight of all</v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

661
00:29:21.031 --> 00:29:22.560
<v Speaker 3>He can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do argue that,</v>

662
00:29:22.561 --> 00:29:24.690
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people get mad at me,</v>

663
00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:26.460
<v Speaker 3>they say fado is number one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

664
00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:27.960
<v Speaker 3>nah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe.</v>

665
00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:29.160
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>

666
00:29:29.161 --> 00:29:29.911
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

667
00:29:29.911 --> 00:29:33.210
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really think that you have to be open</v>

668
00:29:33.211 --> 00:29:36.630
<v Speaker 3>minded about this number one debate and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think until silverdome just got</v>

669
00:29:36.631 --> 00:29:39.960
<v Speaker 3>knocked out for dumas in the running for</v>
<v Speaker 3>the debate 100 percent.</v>

670
00:29:40.050 --> 00:29:42.160
<v Speaker 3>I mean the system is in his prime</v>

671
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:45.970
<v Speaker 2>really submits minotauro and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>think fader wasn't as prime though.</v>

672
00:29:45.971 --> 00:29:47.780
<v Speaker 2>That's why I disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was the first guy.</v>

673
00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:52.030
<v Speaker 2>He was the first guy to do it when it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was faye door and then after that it was</v>

674
00:29:52.031 --> 00:29:56.290
<v Speaker 2>a guy he did gain already,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think he was already on the slide.</v>

675
00:29:56.430 --> 00:30:01.430
<v Speaker 2>He was sitting there was still that kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of prestigious like app after he lost</v>

676
00:30:01.481 --> 00:30:02.540
<v Speaker 2>that and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh fuck it.</v>

677
00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:07.450
<v Speaker 2>Coaches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Coaches were saying that his view,</v>

678
00:30:07.530 --> 00:30:12.530
<v Speaker 2>his own mma coach after he knocked out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brett rogers said that fate or one with</v>

679
00:30:12.641 --> 00:30:15.580
<v Speaker 2>his old tricks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he would have liked to have him for</v>

680
00:30:15.581 --> 00:30:18.250
<v Speaker 2>more time training and he thinks he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>

681
00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:21.450
<v Speaker 2>He's not approaching it correctly and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>just won by being fatal,</v>

682
00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:22.830
<v Speaker 2>but he also caught,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

683
00:30:22.910 --> 00:30:25.240
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for dme with that old trick.</v>

684
00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:27.400
<v Speaker 2>He caught him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>knocked him down,</v>

685
00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:30.700
<v Speaker 2>and then the mistake of federal members,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he jumped into his guard,</v>

686
00:30:30.701 --> 00:30:33.850
<v Speaker 2>but remember he jumped into pounder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he caught him really,</v>

687
00:30:33.851 --> 00:30:34.570
<v Speaker 2>really well.</v>

688
00:30:34.570 --> 00:30:39.160
<v Speaker 2>Knocked him down with the exact same</v>
<v Speaker 2>time that he did to everybody before</v>

689
00:30:39.161 --> 00:30:40.660
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So maybe,</v>

690
00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:46.930
<v Speaker 2>or maybe verdugo goes down on purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The moment a punch hits him so he could</v>

691
00:30:46.931 --> 00:30:49.610
<v Speaker 2>drag you into which he does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

692
00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:53.170
<v Speaker 2>He's a smart guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a very smart guy.</v>

693
00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:57.040
<v Speaker 2>Fight smarter than saturday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely did not face first because he</v>

694
00:30:57.041 --> 00:30:59.500
<v Speaker 2>got tagged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you watch the stoppage,</v>

695
00:30:59.530 --> 00:31:01.030
<v Speaker 2>if you see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you can find the highlights,</v>

696
00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:03.850
<v Speaker 2>I'll show it to you because this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that I wish somebody brought</v>

697
00:31:03.851 --> 00:31:08.851
<v Speaker 2>up during the actual commentary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got tagged right before he got</v>

698
00:31:09.041 --> 00:31:11.500
<v Speaker 2>knocked out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got tagged on the same thing with the</v>

699
00:31:11.501 --> 00:31:13.060
<v Speaker 2>right hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He moved forward.</v>

700
00:31:13.061 --> 00:31:14.620
<v Speaker 2>He was making these advances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He moved forward.</v>

701
00:31:14.621 --> 00:31:18.310
<v Speaker 2>He got tagged with that right hand and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think he was on queer street and I think</v>

702
00:31:18.311 --> 00:31:22.750
<v Speaker 2>he went running at steep a on queer</v>
<v Speaker 2>street and got knocked the fuck out and</v>

703
00:31:22.751 --> 00:31:23.740
<v Speaker 2>the way steep a did.</v>

704
00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:28.740
<v Speaker 2>It was a fucking work of art.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The angle it was forest baby step to the</v>

705
00:31:29.381 --> 00:31:31.210
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's better,</v>

706
00:31:32.050 --> 00:31:34.210
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His angle was sick and obviously his</v>

707
00:31:34.211 --> 00:31:39.211
<v Speaker 2>right hand was nasty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also volume did get hit early and</v>

708
00:31:41.141 --> 00:31:46.030
<v Speaker 2>in training if you've seen him trained,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this competition within that.</v>

709
00:31:46.031 --> 00:31:47.230
<v Speaker 2>Jim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you get hit it's like,</v>

710
00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:49.850
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got to get them back more.</v>

711
00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:52.820
<v Speaker 2>He gets hit and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go charging bull.</v>

712
00:31:52.821 --> 00:31:54.010
<v Speaker 2>And was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck this man.</v>

713
00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:57.790
<v Speaker 2>I think it's probably a little of both.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree because I definitely think both.</v>

714
00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:01.720
<v Speaker 2>He got crack crack and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that is a big right hand that he</v>

715
00:32:01.721 --> 00:32:03.460
<v Speaker 2>got hit with and it's in the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>manner.</v>

716
00:32:03.530 --> 00:32:05.260
<v Speaker 2>The same enters charging for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got hit.</v>

717
00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:07.780
<v Speaker 2>That's how although got knocked out</v>
<v Speaker 2>against mcgregor.</v>

718
00:32:07.790 --> 00:32:09.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to be fucking real careful</v>

719
00:32:09.641 --> 00:32:14.641
<v Speaker 2>charging for</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] and steve bay's not got some</v>

720
00:32:15.551 --> 00:32:18.480
<v Speaker 2>great guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's not a knockout artists per safe</v>

721
00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:21.340
<v Speaker 2>compared to like a Mark Nelson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not knockout artist.</v>

722
00:32:21.550 --> 00:32:24.850
<v Speaker 2>When the guy's charging in like that and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're counting with right hand,</v>

723
00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:26.950
<v Speaker 2>it makes it seem way worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

724
00:32:27.010 --> 00:32:30.310
<v Speaker 2>here's my take on steve based power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think steve has big power,</v>

725
00:32:30.311 --> 00:32:33.010
<v Speaker 2>but I think he fights economically and</v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligently.</v>

726
00:32:33.011 --> 00:32:36.260
<v Speaker 2>He's a smooth fighter boxer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a very good boxer,</v>

727
00:32:36.261 --> 00:32:40.040
<v Speaker 2>a golden gloves boxer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's like smooth and relaxed in the</v>

728
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:41.960
<v Speaker 3>way he spars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the things that makes them</v>

729
00:32:41.961 --> 00:32:45.110
<v Speaker 3>so dangerous because as he does things</v>
<v Speaker 3>very correctly,</v>

730
00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:46.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think,</v>

731
00:32:46.770 --> 00:32:49.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dc was on the commentary for the ufc</v>

732
00:32:49.791 --> 00:32:51.620
<v Speaker 3>recently who was talking about getting</v>
<v Speaker 3>the rub.</v>

733
00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:53.750
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was talking about that experience.</v>

734
00:32:53.751 --> 00:32:55.790
<v Speaker 3>When you have a tough fight with</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone,</v>

735
00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:59.340
<v Speaker 3>you get the rub and he fought junior dos</v>
<v Speaker 3>santos and they went to war.</v>

736
00:32:59.341 --> 00:33:01.190
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean rubbed the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what I mean,</v>

737
00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:02.860
<v Speaker 3>what he was saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

738
00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:04.640
<v Speaker 3>daniel says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you fight someone that's really</v>

739
00:33:04.641 --> 00:33:07.760
<v Speaker 3>good and they're better than you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if you lose you,</v>

740
00:33:07.790 --> 00:33:09.670
<v Speaker 3>it elevates you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get the rub,</v>

741
00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:12.530
<v Speaker 3>but just by sharing the ring with them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just by being in that,</v>

742
00:33:12.770 --> 00:33:15.920
<v Speaker 3>by competing with them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you realize how good you are to actually</v>

743
00:33:15.921 --> 00:33:18.110
<v Speaker 3>get better and you realize how good that</v>
<v Speaker 3>person is.</v>

744
00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:20.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he got the rub when he fought</v>

745
00:33:20.421 --> 00:33:24.110
<v Speaker 3>junior dos santos in a way because he</v>
<v Speaker 3>went five rounds with a guy who was the</v>

746
00:33:24.111 --> 00:33:26.210
<v Speaker 3>one of the toughest of the tough guy was</v>
<v Speaker 3>at one,</v>

747
00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:27.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a champion and knocked out cain</v>

748
00:33:27.801 --> 00:33:31.760
<v Speaker 3>velasquez was one punch and he went five</v>
<v Speaker 3>hard rounds with them and the decision</v>

749
00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:33.030
<v Speaker 3>will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could've went either way and,</v>

750
00:33:33.031 --> 00:33:34.340
<v Speaker 3>and took his best shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

751
00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:37.940
<v Speaker 3>and I also think that to go back to</v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] point and your point with</v>

752
00:33:37.941 --> 00:33:41.120
<v Speaker 3>the rub,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think at the ufc level,</v>

753
00:33:41.121 --> 00:33:42.860
<v Speaker 3>special wouldn't get in that top</v>
<v Speaker 3>echelon.</v>

754
00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:43.800
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're getting,</v>

755
00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:46.970
<v Speaker 3>people are telling you you're good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like when he beat arloski,</v>

756
00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:48.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>starched them.</v>

757
00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:52.010
<v Speaker 3>You don't learn much from that man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When he go up to a decision with a world</v>

758
00:33:52.011 --> 00:33:54.530
<v Speaker 3>class guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you know like you're doing</v>

759
00:33:54.531 --> 00:33:55.880
<v Speaker 3>something right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your camp,</v>

760
00:33:55.881 --> 00:33:57.710
<v Speaker 3>you're doing it right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you had good gas,</v>

761
00:33:57.860 --> 00:33:59.690
<v Speaker 3>you realize what works,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does it,</v>

762
00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:02.000
<v Speaker 3>so you've learned so much more and he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to,</v>

763
00:34:02.030 --> 00:34:04.700
<v Speaker 3>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more with jds and we see them getting</v>

764
00:34:04.701 --> 00:34:05.750
<v Speaker 3>better and better.</v>

765
00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:10.070
<v Speaker 3>What's really interesting now is here's</v>
<v Speaker 3>the dark horse.</v>

766
00:34:10.130 --> 00:34:13.340
<v Speaker 3>Nobody talks about stephan struve is</v>
<v Speaker 3>only 28 years old.</v>

767
00:34:13.970 --> 00:34:18.230
<v Speaker 3>That fucking dude is gigantic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's seven feet tall and if he could put</v>

768
00:34:18.231 --> 00:34:20.800
<v Speaker 3>it together and he put it together on</v>
<v Speaker 3>big foot silver the other night,</v>

769
00:34:20.830 --> 00:34:23.260
<v Speaker 3>knocked him out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love the guy has a bunch of knockout</v>

770
00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:24.830
<v Speaker 3>losses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know he does,</v>

771
00:34:25.070 --> 00:34:29.380
<v Speaker 3>but he knocked out steepbank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Struve not got steep and that was his</v>

772
00:34:29.390 --> 00:34:30.610
<v Speaker 3>only loss than the ufc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

773
00:34:30.670 --> 00:34:32.920
<v Speaker 3>let's do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do struve do not count that guy out.</v>

774
00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:36.950
<v Speaker 3>Stripped at an inside leg kick and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least got that heart issue and stuff.</v>

775
00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:38.660
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what he's got going on</v>

776
00:34:38.661 --> 00:34:40.820
<v Speaker 3>physically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm saying that kid,</v>

777
00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:44.180
<v Speaker 3>if he puts it all together when you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>seven feet tall,</v>

778
00:34:44.660 --> 00:34:47.930
<v Speaker 3>how long does it take before you even</v>
<v Speaker 3>get coordinated?</v>

779
00:34:47.931 --> 00:34:50.270
<v Speaker 3>RiGht?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean east like you're sending a</v>

780
00:34:50.271 --> 00:34:54.500
<v Speaker 3>message and it's got to go so far before</v>
<v Speaker 3>it gets to your fucking hand.</v>

781
00:34:54.740 --> 00:34:55.670
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

782
00:34:55.730 --> 00:34:58.520
<v Speaker 3>have you thought you guys are super tall</v>
<v Speaker 3>like jack man,</v>

783
00:34:58.521 --> 00:35:02.440
<v Speaker 3>those guys?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean like the thing is,</v>

784
00:35:02.441 --> 00:35:06.140
<v Speaker 3>is steep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>steep based struve would be such a</v>

785
00:35:06.141 --> 00:35:09.020
<v Speaker 3>fricking handful of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could learn to use his reach,</v>

786
00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:13.460
<v Speaker 3>but you guys like Roy Nelson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you get these upper echelon guys,</v>

787
00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:15.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing gets big foot,</v>

788
00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:18.460
<v Speaker 3>but off trt or whatever the case he</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually needs it offered.</v>

789
00:35:18.461 --> 00:35:22.040
<v Speaker 3>It's I think anyone that top 20 kinda</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucked him up.</v>

790
00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:24.770
<v Speaker 3>But with struve,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the real testament who they give them</v>

791
00:35:24.771 --> 00:35:26.330
<v Speaker 3>that because that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got fucked up.</v>

792
00:35:26.331 --> 00:35:29.960
<v Speaker 3>I overeem and overcome those toys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Superintelligent fight the way father</v>

794
00:35:31.041 --> 00:35:33.580
<v Speaker 3>Take down on top of him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just ground upon the show about</v>

<v Speaker 3>40 fights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

799
00:35:41.450 --> 00:35:43.520

<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

800
00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:45.240
<v Speaker 3>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what he's got.</v>

801
00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:47.670

<v Speaker 3>I forget.</v>

802
00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:50.010
<v Speaker 3>We have the same manager,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he deals with it all the time.</v>

803
00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:51.990
<v Speaker 3>That Mark Hunt knockouts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>jesus christ.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm curious to see if steve can get</v>
<v Speaker 3>within boxing distance of allister and</v>

811
00:36:09.751 --> 00:36:11.580
<v Speaker 3>take away any of those kicks and how he</v>
<v Speaker 3>sets it up.</v>

812
00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:14.190
<v Speaker 3>It was going to be interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alster combox man.</v>

813
00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:15.210
<v Speaker 3>He can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Knocked out junior with one punch.</v>

816
00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.150
<v Speaker 3>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's the best striker in the ufc</v>

817
00:36:24.151 --> 00:36:25.770
<v Speaker 3>heavyweight division maybe of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

818
00:36:25.771 --> 00:36:26.604
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So steve.</v>

819
00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:29.400
<v Speaker 3>Steve bay then is going to have to close</v>
<v Speaker 3>that distance and knocks him.</v>

820
00:36:29.490 --> 00:36:31.730
<v Speaker 3>Not necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Steve bay could crack him.</v>

821
00:36:31.731 --> 00:36:33.090
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ben rothwell knocked him out in the</v>

822
00:36:33.091 --> 00:36:34.470
<v Speaker 3>first round.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cep has better,</v>

823
00:36:34.870 --> 00:36:38.530
<v Speaker 3>can happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and footwork and has been stopped a lot.</v>

824
00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:41.550
<v Speaker 3>Chins the question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>ThIs is the thing people forget with</v>

825
00:36:41.551 --> 00:36:43.800
<v Speaker 3>allister.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The motherfucking grapple.</v>

826
00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:45.140
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In wrestling.</v>

827
00:36:45.141 --> 00:36:47.220
<v Speaker 3>Grapple his ass off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you want to go to the ground with</v>

828
00:36:47.221 --> 00:36:48.360
<v Speaker 3>them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're gonna be in a world of trouble.</v>

829
00:36:48.361 --> 00:36:51.130
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he won the abu dhabi european trials and</v>

830
00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:53.370
<v Speaker 3>in pride he submitted vituro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got an.</v>

831
00:36:53.371 --> 00:36:56.090
<v Speaker 3>He also submitted Mark Hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has a nasty good team.</v>

832
00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:56.933
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Zoos.</v>

833
00:36:56.960 --> 00:37:01.110
<v Speaker 3>I always forget about just as a striker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you want to get to the ground.</v>

834
00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:03.420
<v Speaker 3>I don't think steve bay has a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>submission.</v>

835
00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:07.560
<v Speaker 3>Work under is so steep and I trained for</v>
<v Speaker 3>two years together.</v>

836
00:37:07.561 --> 00:37:10.020
<v Speaker 3>That kid has submission defense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

837
00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:11.160
<v Speaker 3>rashad is his black belt.</v>

838
00:37:11.610 --> 00:37:15.060
<v Speaker 3>If you ask god to show you like a homo</v>
<v Speaker 3>plot or a real specific,</v>

839
00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:16.980
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>offensive move,</v>

840
00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:19.740
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think at that black belt level,</v>

841
00:37:20.010 --> 00:37:24.960
<v Speaker 3>but his defense and that defense is nest</v>
<v Speaker 3>super nasty.</v>

842
00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:26.430
<v Speaker 3>It's jUst what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's really good at.</v>

843
00:37:26.431 --> 00:37:28.710
<v Speaker 3>Defense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a very smart athlete,</v>

844
00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:32.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and in good it's when you have a guy</v>

845
00:37:32.191 --> 00:37:34.530
<v Speaker 3>who's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who could probably be a professional</v>

846
00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:35.730
<v Speaker 3>ballplayer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

847
00:37:35.731 --> 00:37:38.010
<v Speaker 3>You will see bay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He could probably be a professional</v>

848
00:37:38.011 --> 00:37:38.970
<v Speaker 3>ball.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't make it.</v>

849
00:37:39.210 --> 00:37:39.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he didn't make,</v>

850
00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:42.960
<v Speaker 3>but he's at this level of an of an</v>
<v Speaker 3>athlete now.</v>

851
00:37:42.961 --> 00:37:46.830
<v Speaker 3>What I'm saying is it's rare that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>see a guy like that who comes over to</v>

852
00:37:46.831 --> 00:37:50.100
<v Speaker 3>mma and fights like super technical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>super smart,</v>

853
00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:53.590
<v Speaker 3>who's also really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really tough firefighter.</v>

854
00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:55.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For professional,</v>

855
00:37:55.470 --> 00:37:58.230
<v Speaker 3>full time head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His head is the biggest head I've ever,</v>

856
00:37:58.290 --> 00:37:59.310
<v Speaker 3>ever seen into large set.</v>

857
00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:01.170
<v Speaker 3>Nicest guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a great guy,</v>

858
00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:04.470
<v Speaker 3>but he's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got a rare set of attributes,</v>

859
00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:07.650
<v Speaker 3>meaning that he's at pro sports athlete</v>
<v Speaker 3>level,</v>

860
00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:10.530
<v Speaker 3>like as far as like his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his ability,</v>

861
00:38:10.531 --> 00:38:14.070
<v Speaker 3>his movement and his intelligence and</v>
<v Speaker 3>his approach and his training and then</v>

862
00:38:14.071 --> 00:38:19.071
<v Speaker 3>on top of that he's tough as fuck stuff</v>
<v Speaker 3>is tough as fuck.</v>

863
00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:21.390
<v Speaker 3>Like in this fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me tell you something,</v>

864
00:38:21.391 --> 00:38:22.500
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wAtched this fight,</v>

865
00:38:22.501 --> 00:38:27.420
<v Speaker 3>very careful and one of the things that</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was noticing was like how calm he was</v>

866
00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:30.110
<v Speaker 3>through everything through the walk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they watched,</v>

867
00:38:30.111 --> 00:38:32.640
<v Speaker 3>when they're staring each other down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things you Really pay</v>

868
00:38:32.641 --> 00:38:37.641
<v Speaker 3>attention to is the shortness of the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you watch people breathing during</v>

869
00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:42.010
<v Speaker 3>nervous situations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of times even if they look calm,</v>

870
00:38:42.310 --> 00:38:46.570
<v Speaker 3>you could sort of see this uneasiness in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way they're taking in oxygen.</v>

871
00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:47.890
<v Speaker 3>You're sensing tension.</v>

872
00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.170
<v Speaker 3>You don't see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't sense any of that shit looking</v>

873
00:38:50.171 --> 00:38:50.441
<v Speaker 3>at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

874
00:38:50.441 --> 00:38:54.070
<v Speaker 3>what's impressive to if he doesn't Come</v>
<v Speaker 3>from like a mastermind camp.</v>

875
00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:56.020

876
00:38:56.021 --> 00:38:58.120
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just might have a mastermind can be.</v>

877
00:38:58.121 --> 00:39:00.610
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of masterminds out there</v>
<v Speaker 3>that don't have the right pupil.</v>

878
00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:03.940
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying He's not from like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>jackson's ha att.</v>

879
00:39:03.941 --> 00:39:08.941
<v Speaker 3>He kicks his shit within cleveland and</v>
<v Speaker 3>does work and then goes and saves people</v>

880
00:39:09.581 --> 00:39:11.350
<v Speaker 3>from burning buildings.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Just some fucking thick dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

902
00:40:08.110 --> 00:40:09.610
<v Speaker 3>eddie bravo had a real good point about</v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

903
00:40:09.611 --> 00:40:10.990
<v Speaker 3>We were talking about it on the phone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>

904
00:40:11.110 --> 00:40:13.270
<v Speaker 3>fabrizio looked too relaxed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He like,</v>

905
00:40:13.271 --> 00:40:14.650
<v Speaker 3>he was coming up to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the ring.</v>

906
00:40:14.651 --> 00:40:16.360
<v Speaker 3>He was making that face that he may say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

907
00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:17.700
<v Speaker 3>so sick of that face.</v>

908
00:40:17.730 --> 00:40:19.150
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's being funny.</v>

909
00:40:19.151 --> 00:40:21.610
<v Speaker 3>It's being silly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think theRe's anything wrong</v>

910
00:40:21.611 --> 00:40:24.250
<v Speaker 3>with a fighter trying to stay loose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't at all.</v>

911
00:40:24.550 --> 00:40:27.880
<v Speaker 3>I think that's one of the things that</v>
<v Speaker 3>fabrizio does to have a good time.</v>

912
00:40:27.881 --> 00:40:30.220
<v Speaker 3>He likes to make that sale.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's also been doing it forever.</v>

913
00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:33.040
<v Speaker 3>He's the man he's supposed for over to</v>
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>

914
00:40:33.041 --> 00:40:34.730
<v Speaker 3>If he won the fight and made that face</v>
<v Speaker 3>number one,</v>

915
00:40:34.750 --> 00:40:37.780
<v Speaker 3>say a fucking word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If he went out theRe and head kicked,</v>

917
00:40:40.091 --> 00:40:42.790

<v Speaker 3>but it didn't work out.</v>

918
00:40:42.791 --> 00:40:45.790
<v Speaker 3>So when It doesn't work out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's when everybody comes shitting on</v>

<v Speaker 3>it's just what comes.</v>

932
00:41:16.061 --> 00:41:19.840
<v Speaker 3>It's part of what people love about</v>
<v Speaker 3>people bragging or they want to bring</v>

933
00:41:19.841 --> 00:41:20.674
<v Speaker 3>you down though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

934
00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:23.750
<v Speaker 3>No matter how I look how loose steep it</v>
<v Speaker 3>looks because loose.</v>

935
00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:26.350
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's fighting for the title nice</v>
<v Speaker 3>and loose,</v>

936
00:41:26.351 --> 00:41:30.070
<v Speaker 3>so he moves away keeping the argued.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He should have got titled earlier too,</v>

937
00:41:30.071 --> 00:41:33.660
<v Speaker 3>but he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's just such a nice guy and a lot of</v>

938
00:41:33.770 --> 00:41:36.010
<v Speaker 3>checking to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lot of good checking of kicks.</v>

939
00:41:36.130 --> 00:41:38.530
<v Speaker 3>Her kids more ties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very good luck,</v>

940
00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:43.010
<v Speaker 3>very educated with his movements and</v>
<v Speaker 3>look for breezy has got some fucking</v>

941
00:41:43.011 --> 00:41:45.140
<v Speaker 3>nasty kicks man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's like right there.</v>

942
00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:48.890
<v Speaker 3>His striking is much improved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We saw in the travis brown fight,</v>

943
00:41:48.891 --> 00:41:52.740
<v Speaker 3>man over dangerous on the statement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the last fight,</v>

944
00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:55.340
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his striking is fucking legit.</v>

945
00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:58.910
<v Speaker 3>He's long as shit and he's got</v>
<v Speaker 3>confidence in it.</v>

946
00:41:58.911 --> 00:42:01.440
<v Speaker 3>That nice switch kick their butt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a beast.</v>

947
00:42:01.710 --> 00:42:03.800
<v Speaker 3>I think in order to be that dangerous of</v>
<v Speaker 3>a fighter,</v>

948
00:42:03.801 --> 00:42:05.840
<v Speaker 3>you're going to have to open yourself up</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little bit.</v>

949
00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:08.610
<v Speaker 3>Then when he fight a real strategic guy</v>
<v Speaker 3>like steep a year,</v>

950
00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:10.010
<v Speaker 3>didn't get a little bit of trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

951
00:42:10.011 --> 00:42:14.060
<v Speaker 3>I think what happened in this fight in</v>
<v Speaker 3>particular is that he forced it.</v>

952
00:42:14.350 --> 00:42:14.910
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank.</v>

953
00:42:14.910 --> 00:42:19.550
<v Speaker 3>He was in this gigantic soccer arena.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the biggest crowd in history and</v>

954
00:42:19.551 --> 00:42:22.030
<v Speaker 3>mma in Brazil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at that beautiful leg kick though.</v>

955
00:42:23.250 --> 00:42:25.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The inside the chat doesn't have that.</v>

956
00:42:26.250 --> 00:42:27.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all nice.</v>

957
00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:30.860
<v Speaker 3>Like the technique is real nice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think for breesa was just so</v>

958
00:42:30.861 --> 00:42:34.460
<v Speaker 3>ramped up because there's all these</v>
<v Speaker 3>people in Brazil and I think he's a</v>

959
00:42:34.461 --> 00:42:35.120
<v Speaker 3>confident man.</v>

960
00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:37.310
<v Speaker 3>I think he thinks he's the fucking best</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the world.</v>

961
00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:39.660
<v Speaker 3>He just has to get ahold of this dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a right hand.</v>

962
00:42:39.661 --> 00:42:40.540
<v Speaker 3>He nailed right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

963
00:42:41.090 --> 00:42:43.040
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so now we can take a shot tab.</v>

964
00:42:43.130 --> 00:42:44.240
<v Speaker 3>But now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But now look,</v>

965
00:42:44.241 --> 00:42:46.610
<v Speaker 3>he's forcing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Forcing it because he landed at.</v>

966
00:42:46.730 --> 00:42:47.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So watch.</v>

967
00:42:47.631 --> 00:42:51.650
<v Speaker 3>When he starts to force it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he gets hit real hard and then he gets</v>

968
00:42:51.651 --> 00:42:54.110
<v Speaker 3>hit hard and knocked out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He tried that knee,</v>

969
00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:59.180
<v Speaker 3>tries forward and when sees he got a</v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible single attempt there.</v>

970
00:42:59.181 --> 00:43:01.190
<v Speaker 3>That was like such a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like getting steeper on that.</v>

971
00:43:01.191 --> 00:43:03.890
<v Speaker 3>He was also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he might've been just trying to</v>

972
00:43:03.891 --> 00:43:08.540
<v Speaker 3>make them work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe open up possibilities can drop in</v>

973
00:43:08.670 --> 00:43:10.590
<v Speaker 3>his mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

974
00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:12.330
<v Speaker 3>and range.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's not afraid to just be right in</v>

975
00:43:12.331 --> 00:43:13.400
<v Speaker 3>their grills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not toby,</v>

976
00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:16.700
<v Speaker 3>he's not writing range,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's real relaxed.</v>

977
00:43:16.701 --> 00:43:18.190
<v Speaker 3>Like even the waste throwing that tap,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tap,</v>

978
00:43:18.191 --> 00:43:18.681
<v Speaker 3>tap,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tap,</v>

979
00:43:18.681 --> 00:43:18.890
<v Speaker 3>tap.</v>

980
00:43:18.890 --> 00:43:22.440
<v Speaker 3>Now like he's economical and when your</v>
<v Speaker 3>economical and a five round fight,</v>

981
00:43:22.441 --> 00:43:25.730
<v Speaker 3>it's super difficult chat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was a very nice lady by fabrizio.</v>

982
00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:28.040
<v Speaker 3>These timing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that jabin great inside.</v>

983
00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:33.080
<v Speaker 3>Located in the jab also is super light.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he's just floating it out there.</v>

984
00:43:33.591 --> 00:43:34.970
<v Speaker 3>Pop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nice lock.</v>

985
00:43:35.250 --> 00:43:36.530
<v Speaker 3>Step 20 jeff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he steps to the,</v>

986
00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:39.530
<v Speaker 3>to the side there like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like look at that jacket,</v>

987
00:43:39.790 --> 00:43:41.480
<v Speaker 3>like that is to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

988
00:43:41.481 --> 00:43:43.820
<v Speaker 3>he's not just no tension there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

989
00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:46.550
<v Speaker 3>LIke it's like flowing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They check that link again.</v>

990
00:43:46.551 --> 00:43:47.650
<v Speaker 3>Nice leg kick by.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Steep.</v>

991
00:43:47.660 --> 00:43:48.800
<v Speaker 3>A nice switch.</v>

992
00:43:51.770 --> 00:43:54.350
<v Speaker 3>So right now for me was realizing like</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

993
00:43:54.351 --> 00:43:57.810
<v Speaker 3>this is an easy</v>
<v Speaker 3>part.</v>

994
00:43:57.950 --> 00:43:59.570
<v Speaker 3>That's the one you're reading right</v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

995
00:43:59.630 --> 00:44:00.750
<v Speaker 3>Bang.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the chaos.</v>

996
00:44:01.070 --> 00:44:02.490
<v Speaker 3>Now back it up again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Watch.</v>

997
00:44:02.810 --> 00:44:05.900
<v Speaker 3>Just just back it up just a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 3>to where it's chasing them.</v>

998
00:44:06.110 --> 00:44:09.110
<v Speaker 3>So watching these chance he got rocky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ideal player is really</v>

999
00:44:11.070 --> 00:44:12.650
<v Speaker 3>your problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're right.</v>

1000
00:44:12.651 --> 00:44:13.980
<v Speaker 3>I saw that correct though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>joe.</v>

1001
00:44:14.090 --> 00:44:16.340
<v Speaker 3>I didn't see that until.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he got mad and he came out.</v>

1002
00:44:16.341 --> 00:44:17.180
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

1003
00:44:17.181 --> 00:44:18.210
<v Speaker 3>He got his tag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1004
00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:20.600
<v Speaker 3>He got tagged hard with that right hand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

1005
00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:23.840
<v Speaker 3>And then he kept charging and then he</v>
<v Speaker 3>got face planted with the second one</v>

1006
00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:25.910
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that first right hand had him on queer</v>

1007
00:44:25.911 --> 00:44:27.800
<v Speaker 3>street.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guarantee you because he's moving</v>

1008
00:44:27.801 --> 00:44:31.230
<v Speaker 3>forward and steep aid drops it in on</v>
<v Speaker 3>them and it's the same punch he knocked</v>

1009
00:44:31.231 --> 00:44:34.320
<v Speaker 3>him out with and when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when steve bay throws a punch and this</v>

1010
00:44:34.321 --> 00:44:36.330
<v Speaker 3>is how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know he's good at me,</v>

1011
00:44:36.410 --> 00:44:38.870
<v Speaker 3>obviously it was fucking good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is how you,</v>

1012
00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:40.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>techniques at a real high level.</v>

1013
00:44:41.070 --> 00:44:46.070
<v Speaker 3>His arm is like loose and then he throws</v>
<v Speaker 3>it and then as it gets to his face he</v>

1014
00:44:47.550 --> 00:44:52.550
<v Speaker 3>tightens it down and does this stack</v>
<v Speaker 3>like as he's moving away he's like,</v>

1015
00:44:52.681 --> 00:44:57.681
<v Speaker 3>it's a super efficient,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like really technical punch to the</v>

1016
00:44:58.171 --> 00:45:01.320
<v Speaker 3>throat that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Moving back back in that sense,</v>

1017
00:45:01.321 --> 00:45:03.540
<v Speaker 3>it's very much like what anderson did to</v>
<v Speaker 3>forrest griffin.</v>

1018
00:45:03.541 --> 00:45:07.080
<v Speaker 3>It's also calculated because he threw it</v>
<v Speaker 3>twice and they both land in there,</v>

1019
00:45:07.081 --> 00:45:09.490
<v Speaker 3>but you can tell they're working on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He threw,</v>

1020
00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:13.650
<v Speaker 3>he threw the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The left hook twice to check,</v>

1021
00:45:13.651 --> 00:45:13.921
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1022
00:45:13.921 --> 00:45:17.310
<v Speaker 3>Moving back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>moving back to the side when he does</v>

1023
00:45:17.311 --> 00:45:22.290
<v Speaker 3>that or if it doesn't even necessarily</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to be that he planned it out and</v>

1024
00:45:22.291 --> 00:45:24.780
<v Speaker 3>that was a part of the game plan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think steve bay does that.</v>

1025
00:45:24.820 --> 00:45:28.140
<v Speaker 3>I think he's a really good striker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you look at his Movie and I think</v>

1026
00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:31.920
<v Speaker 3>you're looking at a guy who's super</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking determined,</v>

1027
00:45:31.921 --> 00:45:34.740
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>steve bay is super determined and when</v>

1028
00:45:34.741 --> 00:45:38.490
<v Speaker 3>you're a guy that's that focused,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get fucking really good</v>

1029
00:45:38.491 --> 00:45:39.324
<v Speaker 3>at everything.</v>

1030
00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:41.250
<v Speaker 3>So after he gets that fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that jab,</v>

1031
00:45:41.550 --> 00:45:42.790
<v Speaker 3>jab,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so flu,</v>

1032
00:45:42.791 --> 00:45:44.760
<v Speaker 3>it's like an upper country and it is</v>
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

1033
00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:48.510
<v Speaker 3>It's so like everything he's doing is so</v>
<v Speaker 3>relaxed and efficient.</v>

1034
00:45:48.570 --> 00:45:51.810
<v Speaker 3>You don't see a lot of jabs in february.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can see a lot of jabs,</v>

1035

00:50:51.900 --> 00:50:54.020
<v Speaker 1>super tall as it was back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something,</v>

1151
00:50:54.210 --> 00:50:59.210
<v Speaker 1>a national debate going on on whether or</v>
<v Speaker 1>not women should have to go into the</v>

1152
00:51:00.111 --> 00:51:03.260
<v Speaker 1>same restroom as transgender people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a national debate.</v>

1153
00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:06.890
<v Speaker 1>Who would've ever thought that it would</v>
<v Speaker 1>be this country be so concerned with</v>

1154
00:51:06.891 --> 00:51:10.100
<v Speaker 1>hurting people's feelings that that</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be a big part of the national</v>

1155
00:51:10.101 --> 00:51:13.130
<v Speaker 1>debate part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if a band went out and did that,</v>

1156
00:51:13.580 --> 00:51:15.320
<v Speaker 1>we'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get the fuck out of here with that gay</v>

1157
00:51:15.321 --> 00:51:16.610
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>

1158
00:51:16.670 --> 00:51:21.380
<v Speaker 1>I would repost tHe obama at the federal</v>
<v Speaker 1>government now asking public schools.</v>

1159
00:51:21.380 --> 00:51:24.040
<v Speaker 1>They get public funds to create a</v>
<v Speaker 1>separate bath while.</v>

1160
00:51:24.041 --> 00:51:25.160
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on?</v>

1161
00:51:25.220 --> 00:51:27.170
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this just the internet?</v>

1162
00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:29.720
<v Speaker 1>Is it the pressure of of groups on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>internet?</v>

1163
00:51:29.721 --> 00:51:32.600
<v Speaker 1>Like what is it about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think like anything else for the first</v>

1164
00:51:32.601 --> 00:51:34.790
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the transgender community has a voice</v>

1165
00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:36.860
<v Speaker 1>for the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anytime you have that,</v>

1166
00:51:38.150 --> 00:51:40.580
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have people that get</v>

1167
00:51:40.581 --> 00:51:42.020
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very loud and they're.</v>

1168
00:51:42.170 --> 00:51:45.050
<v Speaker 1>This is their chance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is their moment to say,</v>

1169
00:51:45.051 --> 00:51:46.550
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're here.</v>

1170
00:51:46.850 --> 00:51:51.080
<v Speaker 1>We've been in the closet forever and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're probably going to have the louder</v>

1171
00:51:51.081 --> 00:51:56.081
<v Speaker 1>voices in that community and even the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ones that are more extreme drive the</v>

1172
00:51:56.181 --> 00:51:58.670
<v Speaker 1>debate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is that,</v>

1173
00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:01.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are concerns for all of us.</v>

1174
00:52:01.161 --> 00:52:04.820
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you identify with a different sex,</v>

1175
00:52:04.970 --> 00:52:07.430
<v Speaker 1>if it's really the civil rights act was</v>
<v Speaker 1>all about sex,</v>

1176
00:52:07.431 --> 00:52:07.940
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1177
00:52:07.940 --> 00:52:12.500
<v Speaker 1>But now you're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you're talking about discrimination</v>

1178
00:52:12.501 --> 00:52:17.501
<v Speaker 1>based on How I perceive myself so I can</v>
<v Speaker 1>be a man and if I put a wig on,</v>

1179
00:52:18.750 --> 00:52:21.050
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I say I'm a woman,</v>

1180
00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:25.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm identifying with that gender by</v>
<v Speaker 1>federal law,</v>

1181
00:52:25.790 --> 00:52:30.790
<v Speaker 1>am I then allow to go into a woman's</v>
<v Speaker 1>bathroom that it becomes difficult.</v>

1182
00:52:30.890 --> 00:52:34.880
<v Speaker 1>The problem I have b is like I have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be cool with everything.</v>

1183
00:52:34.970 --> 00:52:37.890
<v Speaker 1>It might be a little weird to me if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1184
00:52:38.180 --> 00:52:40.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a dude in a dress I'm not used</v>

1185
00:52:40.311 --> 00:52:41.110
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I didn't grow up.</v>

1186
00:52:41.110 --> 00:52:45.500
<v Speaker 1>And you're allowed to caItlyn jenner's</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the front of vanity fair or how about</v>

1187
00:52:45.501 --> 00:52:48.140
<v Speaker 1>caitlyn jenner now saying I might want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go back to bruce.</v>

1188
00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:49.250
<v Speaker 1>Do you hear that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1189
00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:50.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1190
00:52:50.940 --> 00:52:54.230
<v Speaker 1>so I know you hate that shit joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm just saying to me it's a little</v>

1191
00:52:54.231 --> 00:52:56.780
<v Speaker 1>weird that she's on the front cover of</v>
<v Speaker 1>sports illustrated.</v>

1192
00:52:56.840 --> 00:52:57.371
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

1193
00:52:57.371 --> 00:53:01.040
<v Speaker 1>I used to be fucking bruce and then I</v>
<v Speaker 1>can hold a homophobe or something like</v>

1194
00:53:01.041 --> 00:53:04.640
<v Speaker 1>that because to me it's a little strange</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I can't have questions sums up.</v>

1195
00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:07.100
<v Speaker 1>I can't be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't force me to accept you're</v>

1196
00:53:07.101 --> 00:53:07.910
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But just,</v>

1197
00:53:07.910 --> 00:53:10.340
<v Speaker 1>if this is the way to look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>

1198
00:53:10.930 --> 00:53:11.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1199
00:53:11.991 --> 00:53:14.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a lot of different minorities.</v>

1200
00:53:14.510 --> 00:53:18.200
<v Speaker 1>Let's just take transgender.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are sexual minority forever.</v>

1201
00:53:18.201 --> 00:53:21.500
<v Speaker 1>they have been relegated to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1202
00:53:21.510 --> 00:53:24.410
<v Speaker 1>the shadows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had to keep it a secret.</v>

1203
00:53:24.580 --> 00:53:25.980
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you felt different,</v>

1204
00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:27.630
<v Speaker 1>etc. Etc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know the stories.</v>

1205
00:53:28.060 --> 00:53:31.320
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what makes a country strong and great is</v>

1206
00:53:31.321 --> 00:53:34.350
<v Speaker 1>the fact that in this country is great</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the difference between this country</v>

1207
00:53:34.351 --> 00:53:38.670
<v Speaker 1>and say Russia is Russia has one idea of</v>
<v Speaker 1>what strength is and that is the biggest</v>

1208
00:53:38.671 --> 00:53:40.470
<v Speaker 1>muscles and the biggest guns.</v>

1209
00:53:40.710 --> 00:53:42.960
<v Speaker 1>And the United States has that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But remember,</v>

1210
00:53:42.961 --> 00:53:47.670
<v Speaker 1>what makes this countrY strong and</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting as a culture is the fact</v>

1211
00:53:47.671 --> 00:53:52.560
<v Speaker 1>that we create a safe haven for people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who think and act differently.</v>

1212
00:53:52.561 --> 00:53:56.970
<v Speaker 1>That's where you get people like marilyn</v>
<v Speaker 1>manson and prince and great artists.</v>

1213
00:53:57.270 --> 00:54:01.620
<v Speaker 1>So the debate becomes how do you make</v>
<v Speaker 1>those people feel safe without,</v>

1214
00:54:01.890 --> 00:54:05.340
<v Speaker 1>without creating major inconvenience</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

1215
00:54:05.730 --> 00:54:06.251
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1216
00:54:06.251 --> 00:54:09.570
<v Speaker 1>the vast majority of the who say we may</v>
<v Speaker 1>not have the funds for a third bath.</v>

1217
00:54:09.610 --> 00:54:12.930
<v Speaker 1>I now you're talking about all an entire</v>
<v Speaker 1>different infrastructure.</v>

1218
00:54:12.931 --> 00:54:16.830
<v Speaker 1>So how do we work the funds to set up a</v>
<v Speaker 1>electric centers for teslas?</v>

1219
00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:18.600
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck You.</v>

1220
00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:19.730
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1221
00:54:19.890 --> 00:54:21.720
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a good debate to have.</v>

1222
00:54:21.721 --> 00:54:24.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the answer was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I meant to talk to you about the show</v>

1223
00:54:24.871 --> 00:54:27.900
<v Speaker 1>about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found the mr han's video.</v>

1224
00:54:28.050 --> 00:54:29.640
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's get back to this because I think</v>

1225
00:54:29.670 --> 00:54:31.690
<v Speaker 1>we're done with this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1226
00:54:32.300 --> 00:54:33.310
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1227
00:54:33.410 --> 00:54:35.920
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I definitely think that there is a</v>

1228
00:54:35.921 --> 00:54:40.921
<v Speaker 3>spectrum of transgender people and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think there's people that you wouldn't</v>

1229
00:54:41.111 --> 00:54:45.130
<v Speaker 3>even notice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there's people that look a lot</v>

1230
00:54:45.131 --> 00:54:50.131
<v Speaker 3>like men and one identify with women and</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are going to be scared of that</v>

1231
00:54:50.380 --> 00:54:53.710
<v Speaker 3>and there's gonna be weirdness of</v>
<v Speaker 3>involved with that because not because</v>

1232
00:54:53.711 --> 00:54:55.390
<v Speaker 3>of the transgender people might be</v>
<v Speaker 3>creepy,</v>

1233
00:54:55.600 --> 00:54:59.560
<v Speaker 3>but because we know that there are men</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are predators that are not</v>

1234
00:54:59.561 --> 00:55:02.430
<v Speaker 3>transgender men that are straight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>THat's what I care about.</v>

1235
00:55:02.530 --> 00:55:06.220
<v Speaker 3>And if you give them the opportunity to</v>
<v Speaker 3>wear a dress and go into the women's</v>

1236
00:55:06.221 --> 00:55:10.360
<v Speaker 3>room and just say they identify with</v>
<v Speaker 3>being a woman one what they wanted on</v>

1237
00:55:10.361 --> 00:55:13.630
<v Speaker 3>North Carolina.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is where it gets interesting is</v>

1238
00:55:13.690 --> 00:55:16.300
<v Speaker 3>you had to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not that you had to be a</v>

1239
00:55:16.301 --> 00:55:19.000
<v Speaker 3>transgender person that please someone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Correct me if I'm wrong,</v>

1240
00:55:19.001 --> 00:55:19.960
<v Speaker 3>because I don't think I am.</v>

1241
00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:22.870
<v Speaker 3>It's not that you couldn't go in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>bathroom.</v>

1242
00:55:22.871 --> 00:55:26.320
<v Speaker 3>If you're a transgender person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's you have to go into the bathroom</v>

1243
00:55:26.500 --> 00:55:29.260
<v Speaker 3>that matches the gender on your birth</v>
<v Speaker 3>certificate.</v>

1244
00:55:29.410 --> 00:55:32.380
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're born a Woman,</v>

1245
00:55:32.530 --> 00:55:36.280
<v Speaker 3>but you want to be a man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can get that changed on your birth</v>

1246
00:55:36.281 --> 00:55:38.400
<v Speaker 3>certificate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know that can.</v>

1247
00:55:38.470 --> 00:55:39.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Apparently you can.</v>

1248
00:55:40.220 --> 00:55:43.870
<v Speaker 3>Did it so if they do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they get it changed on the,</v>

1249
00:55:43.900 --> 00:55:47.410
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how they could change on</v>
<v Speaker 3>your birth certificate 60 years later,</v>

1250
00:55:47.430 --> 00:55:48.263
<v Speaker 3>like they do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1251
00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:51.850
<v Speaker 3>here's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're now we're in this weird semantics</v>

1252
00:55:51.851 --> 00:55:55.060
<v Speaker 3>thing where it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not talking about like technical,</v>

1253
00:55:55.210 --> 00:55:56.620
<v Speaker 3>like what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how,</v>

1254
00:55:56.650 --> 00:55:59.350
<v Speaker 3>how fluid is gender.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we're in.</v>

1255
00:55:59.660 --> 00:56:04.330
<v Speaker 3>We need to really define this before you</v>
<v Speaker 3>just allow someone to wear a dress.</v>

1256
00:56:05.560 --> 00:56:09.030
<v Speaker 1>How someone identifies and it's a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

1257
00:56:09.060 --> 00:56:12.960
<v Speaker 1>It's a very different area than the</v>
<v Speaker 1>legislation that exists.</v>

1258
00:56:12.990 --> 00:56:16.230
<v Speaker 1>It's cloudy because now you're talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about you're not talking about male,</v>

1259
00:56:16.231 --> 00:56:17.790
<v Speaker 1>female.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not saying,</v>

1260
00:56:17.791 --> 00:56:21.570
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you are in the pension plan in this</v>

1261
00:56:21.571 --> 00:56:24.190
<v Speaker 1>company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because women live say 15</v>

1262
00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:27.670
<v Speaker 3>years longer or whatever it might be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to pay more into that pension</v>

1263
00:56:27.671 --> 00:56:28.600
<v Speaker 3>plan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As an example.</v>

1264
00:56:28.601 --> 00:56:31.360
<v Speaker 3>That was unconstitutional because it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>sex discrimination.</v>

1265
00:56:31.361 --> 00:56:36.361
<v Speaker 3>Now these laws are concerned with how</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone identifies.</v>

1266
00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:40.390
<v Speaker 3>It's very murky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you may have a penis,</v>

1267
00:56:40.510 --> 00:56:44.020
<v Speaker 3>but you identify as a woman and you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>taking hormones.</v>

1268
00:56:44.170 --> 00:56:45.520
<v Speaker 3>Now we're in a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very good.</v>

1269
00:56:45.530 --> 00:56:47.650
<v Speaker 3>Here's the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to be taking hormones.</v>

1270
00:56:47.740 --> 00:56:50.260
<v Speaker 3>That's right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just identify with being a woman</v>

1271
00:56:50.261 --> 00:56:52.900
<v Speaker 3>to not want to do anything different</v>
<v Speaker 3>than what you are right now and then go</v>

1272
00:56:52.901 --> 00:56:55.750
<v Speaker 3>into women's rooms like exception though</v>
<v Speaker 3>joe,</v>

1273
00:56:55.751 --> 00:56:57.910
<v Speaker 3>like there's plenty of exceptions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1274
00:56:58.000 --> 00:56:59.670
<v Speaker 3>because if you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

1275
00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:01.960
<v Speaker 3>well guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you gonna put on dress and just to go</v>

1276
00:57:01.961 --> 00:57:03.100
<v Speaker 3>look at little girls something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when.</v>

1277
00:57:03.101 --> 00:57:06.220
<v Speaker 3>That'd be the exception overall perhaps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1278
00:57:06.310 --> 00:57:07.143
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1279
00:57:07.270 --> 00:57:09.610
<v Speaker 3>how many transgender people using</v>
<v Speaker 3>bathrooms,</v>

1280
00:57:10.330 --> 00:57:11.290
<v Speaker 3>that's the exception.</v>

1281
00:57:11.560 --> 00:57:13.990
<v Speaker 3>That's a huge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Except with the exception to that is</v>

1282
00:57:13.991 --> 00:57:16.960
<v Speaker 3>that they're going to go in there just</v>
<v Speaker 3>to look at little girls or molest little</v>

1283
00:57:16.961 --> 00:57:17.830
<v Speaker 3>boys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're right,</v>

1284
00:57:17.831 --> 00:57:20.860
<v Speaker 3>but if it's one out of 100,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's something we should talk about you.</v>

1285
00:57:20.861 --> 00:57:22.210
<v Speaker 3>If it's one out of a can tell you about</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1286
00:57:22.211 --> 00:57:25.330
<v Speaker 3>but you can't make a decision based on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the accepted but you have to figure out</v>

1287
00:57:25.331 --> 00:57:28.990
<v Speaker 3>what it is like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where it gets almost impossible.</v>

1288
00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:32.860
<v Speaker 3>You get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really hard to protect women and</v>

1289
00:57:32.861 --> 00:57:37.660
<v Speaker 3>children from creepy dudes like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is not a slight on transgenders</v>

1290
00:57:37.661 --> 00:57:40.270
<v Speaker 3>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is talking about transgender.</v>

1291
00:57:40.271 --> 00:57:43.210
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about men who are talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about taking advantage of take advantage</v>

1292
00:57:43.211 --> 00:57:44.044
<v Speaker 3>of a law.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

1293
00:57:44.050 --> 00:57:49.030
<v Speaker 3>This has nothing to do with transgenders</v>
<v Speaker 3>giving any possible loophole where a</v>

1294
00:57:49.031 --> 00:57:54.031
<v Speaker 3>piece of shit creepy male predator is</v>
<v Speaker 3>allowed to use a bathroom with a 10 year</v>

1295
00:57:54.041 --> 00:57:55.810
<v Speaker 3>old girl and under the sanction of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>law.</v>

1296
00:57:55.870 --> 00:57:57.070
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>under the sanctions of the law.</v>

1297
00:57:57.970 --> 00:58:00.660
<v Speaker 3>I don't know about all that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not cool with it because when my</v>

1298
00:58:00.670 --> 00:58:02.980
<v Speaker 3>daughter steven crowder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not.</v>

1299
00:58:02.990 --> 00:58:04.510
<v Speaker 3>When you're making a law for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>exception,</v>

1300
00:58:04.511 --> 00:58:07.510
<v Speaker 3>the first place to make a law that says</v>
<v Speaker 3>that transgender people can use a</v>

1301
00:58:07.511 --> 00:58:10.120
<v Speaker 3>woman's room is is an exception.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1302
00:58:10.121 --> 00:58:12.910
<v Speaker 3>Because you are making a law about a</v>
<v Speaker 3>very rare thing.</v>

1303
00:58:13.090 --> 00:58:17.380
<v Speaker 3>A rare thing that when you look at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>entire internet and 7 billion people,</v>

1304
00:58:17.381 --> 00:58:19.420
<v Speaker 3>you see millions of examples of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you go,</v>

1305
00:58:19.421 --> 00:58:21.430
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>transgender community is strong.</v>

1306
00:58:21.431 --> 00:58:24.190
<v Speaker 3>We should recognize that they're being</v>
<v Speaker 3>discriminated against and that's all</v>

1307
00:58:24.191 --> 00:58:25.710
<v Speaker 3>good and I think we all believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1308
00:58:25.750 --> 00:58:29.920
<v Speaker 3>We for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that is a rare thing to make a law</v>

1309
00:58:29.921 --> 00:58:33.540
<v Speaker 3>for when you're dealing with how many</v>
<v Speaker 3>women have to use that restaurant.</v>

1310
00:58:33.541 --> 00:58:35.050
<v Speaker 3>So do you think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hold on a second.</v>

1311
00:58:35.050 --> 00:58:36.700
<v Speaker 3>How many women have to use that</v>
<v Speaker 3>restroom,</v>

1312
00:58:36.870 --> 00:58:38.200
<v Speaker 3>but wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many,</v>

1313
00:58:38.500 --> 00:58:40.600
<v Speaker 3>how many transgenders want to use that</v>
<v Speaker 3>restroom?</v>

1314
00:58:40.601 --> 00:58:43.300
<v Speaker 3>Like what are the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is the actual numbers that we're</v>

1315
00:58:43.301 --> 00:58:46.840
<v Speaker 3>looking at before we start talking about</v>
<v Speaker 3>this and having this goddamn national</v>

1316
00:58:46.841 --> 00:58:50.650
<v Speaker 3>debate training new bathrooms created.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that might be the only way,</v>

1317
00:58:50.651 --> 00:58:54.010
<v Speaker 3>but what are the fucking numbers?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can we just get some data on the</v>

1318
00:58:54.050 --> 00:58:55.360
<v Speaker 3>numbers?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there any actual numbers?</v>

1319
00:58:55.420 --> 00:58:58.900
<v Speaker 3>It must be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then how many men are sexual</v>

1320
00:58:58.901 --> 00:58:59.591
<v Speaker 3>predators?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1321
00:58:59.591 --> 00:59:01.210
<v Speaker 3>that's where it gets really fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>easy.</v>

1322
00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:04.090
<v Speaker 3>All you have to do is go to those sexual</v>
<v Speaker 3>predator apps on your iphone.</v>

1323
00:59:04.270 --> 00:59:07.210
<v Speaker 3>Everywhere you fucking look.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's sexual predators now.</v>

1324
00:59:07.630 --> 00:59:12.200
<v Speaker 3>It could be a lot of different things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know a dude who be got labeled a</v>

1325
00:59:12.201 --> 00:59:15.280
<v Speaker 3>sexual predator because he got caught</v>
<v Speaker 3>taking a piss outside.</v>

1326
00:59:15.850 --> 00:59:18.370
<v Speaker 3>He went outside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exposes dick stepped outside of a bar</v>

1327
00:59:18.371 --> 00:59:19.180
<v Speaker 3>and pissed.</v>

1328
00:59:19.180 --> 00:59:21.290
<v Speaker 3>And because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is ridiculous,</v>

1329
00:59:21.291 --> 00:59:25.010
<v Speaker 3>but it's one of those backwoods country</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck states and it wasn't like the 19</v>

1330
00:59:25.011 --> 00:59:27.890
<v Speaker 3>eighties or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this guy got arrested,</v>

1331
00:59:27.920 --> 00:59:29.560
<v Speaker 3>took a piss off a porsche,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>

1332
00:59:29.710 --> 00:59:31.490
<v Speaker 3>don't piss around a playground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>

1333
00:59:31.510 --> 00:59:34.940
<v Speaker 3>not just one guy that's happened to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This happened to a bunch of guys,</v>

1334
00:59:35.150 --> 00:59:38.140
<v Speaker 3>especially if you expose yourself</v>
<v Speaker 3>anywhere near a school or something.</v>

1335
00:59:38.710 --> 00:59:39.970
<v Speaker 3>This round elements,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sexual,</v>

1336
00:59:40.250 --> 00:59:44.750
<v Speaker 3>sexual predator.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's a lot of what we mean by</v>

1337
00:59:44.751 --> 00:59:47.960
<v Speaker 3>sexual predator problem is how do you</v>
<v Speaker 3>define.</v>

1338
00:59:48.170 --> 00:59:50.810
<v Speaker 3>How do you define what a guy said?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

1339
00:59:50.811 --> 00:59:54.110
<v Speaker 3>there's an artIcle that I read the other</v>
<v Speaker 3>day about a guy with a beard.</v>

1340
00:59:54.260 --> 00:59:56.780
<v Speaker 3>He has a full beard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he identifies as a woman.</v>

1341
00:59:56.781 --> 00:59:59.090
<v Speaker 3>He wants to be able to use women's rooms</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he doesn't,</v>

1342
00:59:59.120 --> 01:00:00.950
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't take hormones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he is a woman.</v>

1343
01:00:00.950 --> 01:00:02.630
<v Speaker 3>He feels like he's a woman and he wants</v>
<v Speaker 3>to go.</v>

1344
01:00:02.631 --> 01:00:04.670
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't want to have surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he identifies.</v>

1345
01:00:04.671 --> 01:00:05.401
<v Speaker 3>can't have that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

1346
01:00:05.401 --> 01:00:06.500
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So here's how I feel.</v>

1347
01:00:06.501 --> 01:00:07.334
<v Speaker 3>My daughterS.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1348
01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:09.320
<v Speaker 3>how about that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you,</v>

1349
01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:11.570
<v Speaker 3>my daughter's eight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other day I had a center into a</v>

1350
01:00:11.571 --> 01:00:15.260
<v Speaker 3>public bathroom at the movie theater.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I assume when I send my eight year old</v>

1351
01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:18.980
<v Speaker 3>into into a woman's bathroom that she's</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be safe because it's going to</v>

1352
01:00:18.981 --> 01:00:20.570
<v Speaker 3>be little girls and women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>

1353
01:00:20.571 --> 01:00:24.500
<v Speaker 3>If I say if there's a dude in there with</v>
<v Speaker 3>a beard who says he identifies as a</v>

1354
01:00:24.501 --> 01:00:27.050
<v Speaker 3>woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not letting my daughter go in that</v>

1355
01:00:27.051 --> 01:00:31.040
<v Speaker 3>bathroom until that guy's out of there</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know why I don't know who that</v>

1356
01:00:31.041 --> 01:00:34.490
<v Speaker 3>dude is and he might say he's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He identifies as a woman.</v>

1357
01:00:34.740 --> 01:00:39.170
<v Speaker 3>He might be fuCking crazy too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's also that possibility,</v>

1358
01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:41.600
<v Speaker 3>but he's not getting near my daughter</v>
<v Speaker 3>and my whoop your ass.</v>

1359
01:00:42.110 --> 01:00:43.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I also don't trust him.</v>

1360
01:00:43.710 --> 01:00:45.920
<v Speaker 3>We'll call it big bearded dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1361
01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.140
<v Speaker 3>I can't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you,</v>

1362
01:00:48.141 --> 01:00:51.230
<v Speaker 3>you know when someone will say that's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>woman and you should say she's a woman.</v>

1363
01:00:51.590 --> 01:00:53.280
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say that's a mega.</v>

1364
01:00:53.390 --> 01:00:54.830
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so when do we draw the line?</v>

1365
01:00:54.831 --> 01:00:56.090
<v Speaker 3>Man?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When we draw the line,</v>

1366
01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:58.640
<v Speaker 3>where do we draw the line?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here was,</v>

1367
01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:02.810
<v Speaker 3>this was a big part of the fallon fox</v>
<v Speaker 3>debate about found fox becoming a</v>

1368
01:01:02.811 --> 01:01:05.440
<v Speaker 3>transgender and then fighting women and</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying she's a woman now.</v>

1369
01:01:05.441 --> 01:01:06.380
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well with,</v>

1370
01:01:06.530 --> 01:01:10.340
<v Speaker 3>with a man's frame.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then it becomes a sociological or</v>

1371
01:01:10.341 --> 01:01:14.840
<v Speaker 3>political issue more than a scientific</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a have a fight analysis,</v>

1372
01:01:15.260 --> 01:01:19.310
<v Speaker 3>which is stupid because physically she's</v>
<v Speaker 3>built like a man fighting little girl.</v>

1373
01:01:19.340 --> 01:01:24.340
<v Speaker 3>There's a bunch of different reactions</v>
<v Speaker 3>some time that one's easy to make and</v>

1374
01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:27.010
<v Speaker 3>then there's also hips,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1375
01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:30.080
<v Speaker 3>the shape of the hips power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like toss it aside.</v>

1376
01:01:30.100 --> 01:01:32.180
<v Speaker 3>But then again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck do you do about someone</v>

1377
01:01:32.181 --> 01:01:35.510
<v Speaker 3>like gabby garcia who is clearly taking</v>
<v Speaker 3>male hormones?</v>

1378
01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:38.000
<v Speaker 3>Like where does that fit in because</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1379
01:01:38.250 --> 01:01:40.970
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're fighting against women and if</v>

1380
01:01:40.971 --> 01:01:44.150
<v Speaker 3>you're fighting against women who are</v>
<v Speaker 3>just taking nothing but you're taking</v>

1381
01:01:44.151 --> 01:01:45.620
<v Speaker 3>male hormones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

1382
01:01:45.710 --> 01:01:47.750
<v Speaker 3>where's this line?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it penis,</v>

1383
01:01:47.751 --> 01:01:49.820
<v Speaker 3>vagina?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that the only line or is there a</v>

1384
01:01:49.821 --> 01:01:52.880
<v Speaker 3>certain amount of hormones you take?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Will you become a fucking dude?</v>

1385
01:01:53.090 --> 01:01:55.130
<v Speaker 3>And if you look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you do it like,</v>

1386
01:01:55.190 --> 01:01:56.990
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like chastity bono,</v>

1387
01:01:57.020 --> 01:01:59.690
<v Speaker 3>chaz bono.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And So she takes the hormones.</v>

1388
01:01:59.691 --> 01:02:01.820
<v Speaker 3>She becomes he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she becomes chaz.</v>

1389
01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:04.130
<v Speaker 3>That's male.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hormones turns into a dude,</v>

1390
01:02:04.131 --> 01:02:05.720
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We all agree because she says it.</v>

1391
01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:08.570
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's gonna be cursio on more or less</v>

1392
01:02:08.690 --> 01:02:11.050
<v Speaker 3>than her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I would suggest but more,</v>

1393
01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:15.290
<v Speaker 3>but I would suggest that question</v>
<v Speaker 3>becomes relevant only when competition</v>

1394
01:02:15.291 --> 01:02:20.291
<v Speaker 3>begins to interfere with your day</v>
<v Speaker 3>routine</v>

1395
01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:21.750
<v Speaker 1>rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When it,</v>

1396
01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:24.960
<v Speaker 1>when it starts getting into situations</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you're going to have to share,</v>

1397
01:02:24.961 --> 01:02:26.640
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an example,</v>

1398
01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:28.980
<v Speaker 1>public space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bathroom,</v>

1399
01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:33.030
<v Speaker 1>some something intimate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fight and sport.</v>

1400
01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:36.610
<v Speaker 1>FighTing sports.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love sports.</v>

1401
01:02:36.620 --> 01:02:40.230
<v Speaker 1>It's even more in spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's way more important because if gabby</v>

1402
01:02:40.231 --> 01:02:43.320
<v Speaker 1>gfsi is on some shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's fighting some poor girl who's just</v>

1403
01:02:43.321 --> 01:02:44.154
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1404
01:02:44.220 --> 01:02:47.100
<v Speaker 1>the regular protein.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's illegal to physically</v>

1405
01:02:47.101 --> 01:02:48.750
<v Speaker 1>get her accidentally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not illegal,</v>

1406
01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:50.690
<v Speaker 1>so I don't legal in Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why.</v>

1407
01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:52.930
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1408
01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:54.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>fallon fox one America.</v>

1409
01:02:54.860 --> 01:02:56.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's situation.</v>

1410
01:02:56.540 --> 01:02:58.050
<v Speaker 1>Toss them aside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's when,</v>

1411
01:02:58.110 --> 01:03:02.250
<v Speaker 1>what are we defining gender?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are we defining it by your own personal</v>

1412
01:03:02.251 --> 01:03:04.350
<v Speaker 1>choices?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you just decide I'm this.</v>

1413
01:03:04.351 --> 01:03:07.020
<v Speaker 1>I feel like a girl would be joanna man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going,</v>

1414
01:03:07.021 --> 01:03:09.130
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's talK about this.</v>

1415
01:03:09.300 --> 01:03:12.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you looked at cyborg d this weekend</v>

1416
01:03:12.750 --> 01:03:15.730
<v Speaker 1>and she was fighting a leslie smith,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smith,</v>

1417
01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:18.960
<v Speaker 1>bless her heart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will look at cyborg and she's a</v>

1418
01:03:18.961 --> 01:03:21.840
<v Speaker 1>woman of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there is something about her</v>

1419
01:03:21.841 --> 01:03:26.841
<v Speaker 1>physicality that clearly she just looks</v>
<v Speaker 1>like she was built to fucking bang on</v>

1420
01:03:27.790 --> 01:03:28.670
<v Speaker 1>people's drama.</v>

1421
01:03:28.730 --> 01:03:30.630
<v Speaker 1>If you ever seen her first fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1422
01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:32.790
<v Speaker 1>she didn't look like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1423
01:03:32.970 --> 01:03:36.250
<v Speaker 1>A lot of it is genetically modified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The.</v>

1424
01:03:36.260 --> 01:03:40.290
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of speculation as to what</v>
<v Speaker 1>she did to in order to look like that,</v>

1425
01:03:40.291 --> 01:03:42.390
<v Speaker 1>but she's also one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's one thing,</v>

1426
01:03:42.391 --> 01:03:46.230
<v Speaker 1>undeniable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That woman works hard.</v>

1427
01:03:46.530 --> 01:03:49.650
<v Speaker 1>She runs six miles everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She trains like A fucking beast.</v>

1428
01:03:49.651 --> 01:03:51.900
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently according to her trainers,</v>

1429
01:03:52.020 --> 01:03:54.600
<v Speaker 1>she has an insane work rate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1430
01:03:54.990 --> 01:03:57.240
<v Speaker 1>But she definitely is tested positive</v>
<v Speaker 1>for something.</v>

1431
01:03:57.241 --> 01:04:00.440
<v Speaker 1>She's does pause,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also now she is in the ufc and I</v>

1432
01:04:00.441 --> 01:04:01.170
<v Speaker 1>don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know.</v>

1433
01:04:01.170 --> 01:04:03.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying she's taking shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got to wait until the drug results</v>

1434
01:04:03.781 --> 01:04:05.700
<v Speaker 1>come back in Brazil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this past fight,</v>

1435
01:04:05.850 --> 01:04:10.850
<v Speaker 1>but at 1:40 1:35,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's by far the best female fighter in</v>

1436
01:04:11.881 --> 01:04:14.850
<v Speaker 1>the ufc until you beat her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Ain't shit dude.</v>

1437
01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:19.260
<v Speaker 1>The way she ran punch your leslie smith</v>
<v Speaker 1>face technique is flawless.</v>

1438
01:04:19.290 --> 01:04:22.050
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the credit has to go to jason</v>

1439
01:04:22.051 --> 01:04:24.900
<v Speaker 1>parillo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's her boxing coach because at her</v>

1440
01:04:24.901 --> 01:04:26.280
<v Speaker 1>level she's been doing it forever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1441
01:04:26.430 --> 01:04:31.430
<v Speaker 1>To take a fighter that has that many</v>
<v Speaker 1>fights and to give them this set of</v>

1442
01:04:31.591 --> 01:04:32.281
<v Speaker 1>skills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1443
01:04:32.281 --> 01:04:35.040
<v Speaker 1>because notice this is what was most</v>
<v Speaker 1>impressive to me in that fight.</v>

1444
01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:37.380
<v Speaker 1>She didn't get hit right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had head movement,</v>

1445
01:04:37.470 --> 01:04:40.080
<v Speaker 1>foot work angles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She didn't get hit.</v>

1446
01:04:40.230 --> 01:04:41.570
<v Speaker 1>Cyborg gets hit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When she fights,</v>

1447
01:04:41.571 --> 01:04:45.260
<v Speaker 1>she'll trade sit bang Mike Tyson style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had footwork.</v>

1448
01:04:45.620 --> 01:04:46.530
<v Speaker 1>Lindsey smith,</v>
<v Speaker 1>atlanta,</v>

1449
01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:48.060
<v Speaker 1>a single punch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see that one.</v>

1450
01:04:48.300 --> 01:04:51.120
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perillo should begin all the credit and</v>

1451
01:04:51.121 --> 01:04:53.100
<v Speaker 1>also perilla work and granted I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

1452
01:04:53.310 --> 01:04:54.510
<v Speaker 1>I've never worked with pearl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

1453
01:04:54.810 --> 01:04:58.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm just analyzing his fighters with</v>
<v Speaker 1>brisbane to bisping box.</v>

1454
01:04:58.530 --> 01:05:02.340
<v Speaker 1>Anderson silva's face off a box and</v>
<v Speaker 1>clinic.</v>

1455
01:05:02.370 --> 01:05:04.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you could shake like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and save face.</v>

1456
01:05:05.260 --> 01:05:06.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't just drop.</v>

1457
01:05:06.380 --> 01:05:08.330
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to exaggerate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The point did drop.</v>

1458
01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:10.830
<v Speaker 1>He dropped him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he also landed the most shots ever.</v>

1459
01:05:10.831 --> 01:05:12.090
<v Speaker 1>An interest in civil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

1460
01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:14.790
<v Speaker 1>a veteran fighter in brisbane who's been</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting forever.</v>

1461
01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.320
<v Speaker 1>What's the one common denominator before</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget,</v>

1462
01:05:17.321 --> 01:05:18.154
<v Speaker 1>coach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you</v>

1463
01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:22.270
<v Speaker 3>think it was dirty when anderson jumping</v>
<v Speaker 3>kneed him in the face or do you think</v>

1464
01:05:22.271 --> 01:05:26.110
<v Speaker 3>that michael bisping's not supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 3>call for a resets on his mouth?</v>

1465
01:05:26.510 --> 01:05:30.520
<v Speaker 3>Bisbing before every fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Herb dean or big john count.</v>

1466
01:05:30.521 --> 01:05:31.130
<v Speaker 3>Go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

1467
01:05:31.130 --> 01:05:32.590
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Protect yourself at all times.</v>

1468
01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:35.380
<v Speaker 3>Don't stop unless I come in and stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We all know that,</v>

1469
01:05:35.470 --> 01:05:38.740
<v Speaker 3>but he's trying to say my mouthpiece.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's talking to the ref and the in,</v>

1470
01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:41.020
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't you think?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would you.</v>

1471
01:05:41.021 --> 01:05:43.210
<v Speaker 3>Would you agree like when is there a</v>
<v Speaker 3>break in the action?</v>

1472
01:05:43.211 --> 01:05:46.690
<v Speaker 3>Technically if a guy's talk to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>referee and he's moving away and he's</v>

1473
01:05:46.691 --> 01:05:47.470
<v Speaker 3>not an exchange,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

1474
01:05:47.470 --> 01:05:48.300
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll drop my mouth.</v>

1475
01:05:48.300 --> 01:05:50.620
<v Speaker 3>Just dropped my mouthpiece.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that a break in the action or is he</v>

1476
01:05:50.621 --> 01:05:54.290
<v Speaker 3>calling for a break in the action and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>could be perceived these calling for a</v>

1477
01:05:54.291 --> 01:05:56.950
<v Speaker 3>break in the action because the momentum</v>
<v Speaker 3>is not shifting his way.</v>

1478
01:05:56.980 --> 01:05:57.890
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1479
01:05:58.110 --> 01:06:01.420
<v Speaker 3>I can't stop until I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

1480
01:06:01.421 --> 01:06:03.760
<v Speaker 3>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm fighting to the death until that's a</v>

1481
01:06:03.761 --> 01:06:04.481
<v Speaker 3>bad term.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There,</v>

1482
01:06:04.481 --> 01:06:07.600
<v Speaker 3>but until a ref tells me not right on</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1483
01:06:07.770 --> 01:06:09.070
<v Speaker 3>so like when I hit cro,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cop,</v>

1484
01:06:09.190 --> 01:06:11.770
<v Speaker 3>that's on herb dean step step your 40</v>
<v Speaker 3>time up son.</v>

1485
01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:14.440
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but should he be allowed to stop to see</v>

1486
01:06:14.441 --> 01:06:16.030
<v Speaker 3>the break in the action things</v>
<v Speaker 3>ambiguous.</v>

1487
01:06:16.031 --> 01:06:17.830
<v Speaker 3>Here's my thought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you move back,</v>

1488
01:06:17.850 --> 01:06:20.500
<v Speaker 3>move back and you put your hands up and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go my mouthpiece and you put your</v>

1489
01:06:20.501 --> 01:06:22.660
<v Speaker 3>hands up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're calling for a break in the action</v>

1490
01:06:22.870 --> 01:06:24.520
<v Speaker 3>and the referee says that's not your</v>
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>

1491
01:06:24.660 --> 01:06:26.140
<v Speaker 3>Your place is to compete.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is correct.</v>

1492
01:06:26.170 --> 01:06:28.390
<v Speaker 3>Or do theY have to wait to an actual</v>
<v Speaker 3>break in the action?</v>

1493
01:06:28.780 --> 01:06:30.580
<v Speaker 3>I think they have to wait for an actual</v>
<v Speaker 3>break,</v>

1494
01:06:30.730 --> 01:06:32.230
<v Speaker 3>but why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you should be.</v>

1495
01:06:32.231 --> 01:06:33.250
<v Speaker 3>You should not be able to fight.</v>

1496
01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:34.900
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should definitely be penalized.</v>

1497
01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:38.260
<v Speaker 3>Like did you see when simon mark has</v>
<v Speaker 3>fought joe schilling kept spitting out</v>

1498
01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:41.170
<v Speaker 3>mouthpiece so they took a point away</v>
<v Speaker 3>from them because they.</v>

1499
01:06:41.230 --> 01:06:45.910
<v Speaker 3>They thought because he kept spitting it</v>
<v Speaker 3>out that he was tired and was trying to</v>

1500
01:06:45.911 --> 01:06:47.460
<v Speaker 3>take a break,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what he was doing.</v>

1501
01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:50.920
<v Speaker 3>Some guys do do that so that in order to</v>
<v Speaker 3>stop that from happening,</v>

1502
01:06:50.921 --> 01:06:52.030
<v Speaker 3>they penalize you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>veterans,</v>

1503
01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:55.840
<v Speaker 3>but referee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if he knows that your mouthpiece is out,</v>

1504
01:06:56.240 --> 01:06:57.790
<v Speaker 3>he should have stopped the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's real.</v>

1505
01:06:57.850 --> 01:06:59.940
<v Speaker 3>It's real tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like just the referee after what?</v>

1506
01:06:59.950 --> 01:07:01.540
<v Speaker 3>Because you really find me looking at</v>
<v Speaker 3>something else though.</v>

1507
01:07:01.541 --> 01:07:03.280
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You really shouldn't be able to see.</v>

1508
01:07:03.281 --> 01:07:06.430
<v Speaker 3>the problem is like lips and gums with</v>
<v Speaker 3>teeth,</v>

1509
01:07:06.431 --> 01:07:08.350
<v Speaker 3>with raw teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>your face getting fucked up.</v>

1510
01:07:08.390 --> 01:07:09.310
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's been an interesting.</v>

1511
01:07:09.311 --> 01:07:11.710
<v Speaker 3>We're kind of in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like it was kinda hit it and it</v>

1512
01:07:11.711 --> 01:07:12.421
<v Speaker 3>came out and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1513
01:07:12.421 --> 01:07:12.600
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1514
01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:12.730
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1515
01:07:12.730 --> 01:07:13.320
<v Speaker 3>Stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stop.</v>

1516
01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:14.310
<v Speaker 3>YeaH.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>

1517
01:07:14.330 --> 01:07:17.480
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He pointed at his mouthpiece low.</v>

1518
01:07:17.530 --> 01:07:21.070
<v Speaker 3>Remember when Paul Harris with nate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mark core turned the ref and said,</v>

1519
01:07:21.071 --> 01:07:22.000
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got stick.</v>

1520
01:07:22.060 --> 01:07:25.280
<v Speaker 3>He's got slippery stuff on his ankle and</v>
<v Speaker 3>nate just dove in and my bow bow bow</v>

1521
01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:30.680
<v Speaker 3>that that's got to be on the fighter who</v>
<v Speaker 3>voluntarily unilaterally take salsa.</v>

1522
01:07:31.241 --> 01:07:32.380
<v Speaker 3>Not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's not dirty.</v>

1523
01:07:32.381 --> 01:07:34.780
<v Speaker 3>It's not dirty because that's a fighter</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>

1524
01:07:34.781 --> 01:07:37.960
<v Speaker 3>It's a very dangerous sport.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see any glimpse where I can get an</v>

1525
01:07:37.961 --> 01:07:40.570
<v Speaker 3>advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm fucking like floyd mayweather and</v>

1526
01:07:40.571 --> 01:07:43.150
<v Speaker 3>victor ortiz.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no problem with that.</v>

1527
01:07:43.151 --> 01:07:45.450
<v Speaker 3>Was that to me was fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's no,</v>

1528
01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:48.040
<v Speaker 3>it's a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He came up and said,</v>

1529
01:07:48.041 --> 01:07:48.874
<v Speaker 3>heY man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorry.</v>

1530
01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:50.870
<v Speaker 3>I already said sorry twice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

1531
01:07:50.890 --> 01:07:52.110
<v Speaker 3>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1532
01:07:52.330 --> 01:07:53.660
<v Speaker 3>that's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bullshit.</v>

1533
01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:54.800
<v Speaker 3>Bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bullshit.</v>

1534
01:07:54.810 --> 01:07:56.560
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you what.</v>

1535
01:07:56.561 --> 01:07:58.570
<v Speaker 3>It was victorious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's at a mental breakdown.</v>

1536
01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:02.800
<v Speaker 3>He was succumbing to the pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was fouling a floyd,</v>

1537
01:08:02.801 --> 01:08:06.520
<v Speaker 3>had this head butting him and he got</v>
<v Speaker 3>penalized for it when it got penalized</v>

1538
01:08:06.521 --> 01:08:10.070
<v Speaker 3>for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wanted to make friends with floyd and</v>

1539
01:08:10.090 --> 01:08:12.220
<v Speaker 3>in the making friends part like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry bro.</v>

1540
01:08:12.460 --> 01:08:14.260
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of times you can't have that in a</v>

1541
01:08:14.261 --> 01:08:15.940
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't that in flight because the</v>

1542
01:08:15.941 --> 01:08:16.610
<v Speaker 3>disruption</v>

1543
01:08:16.610 --> 01:08:19.370
<v Speaker 1>of your focus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's adding in this emotional connection</v>

1544
01:08:19.371 --> 01:08:21.080
<v Speaker 1>with this person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now this person's your buddy.</v>

1545
01:08:21.230 --> 01:08:22.490
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

<v Speaker 1>really famous and things started taking</v>

1553
01:08:40.161 --> 01:08:41.780
<v Speaker 1>off,</v>

<v Speaker 1>He was like the golden boy and then it</v>

<v Speaker 1>just never worked out.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I can't wait for andre.</v>

1564
01:09:06.590 --> 01:09:08.920
<v Speaker 1>Ward is so smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just has to fight more.</v>

1565
01:09:08.940 --> 01:09:11.540
<v Speaker 1>He's so smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that might not be enough.</v>

1566
01:09:11.870 --> 01:09:14.450
<v Speaker 1>Might not be enough against koval other</v>
<v Speaker 1>meds so hard.</v>

1567
01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:17.170
<v Speaker 1>Well he's not so skillful is fuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>killed.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Killer.</v>

1569
01:09:20.690 --> 01:09:22.570
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't give a fuck about,</v>

1570
01:09:22.740 --> 01:09:24.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's kinda stupid talking about.</v>

1571
01:09:24.651 --> 01:09:26.490
<v Speaker 1>But it has legs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Floyd mayweather.</v>

1572
01:09:26.491 --> 01:09:27.510
<v Speaker 1>conor mcgregor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1573
01:09:27.910 --> 01:09:30.260
<v Speaker 1>and if we know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know doesn't have any legs.</v>

1574
01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:31.790
<v Speaker 1>It kinda does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>

1575
01:09:31.940 --> 01:09:33.150
<v Speaker 1>It kinda does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know why?</v>

1576
01:09:33.350 --> 01:09:34.940
<v Speaker 1>Because floyd ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter.</v>

1577
01:09:36.180 --> 01:09:37.910
<v Speaker 1>New ufc is not gonna let it happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1578
01:09:37.911 --> 01:09:40.310
<v Speaker 1>but see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tHe only reason why I disagree with you</v>

1579
01:09:40.311 --> 01:09:43.910
<v Speaker 1>there is because dana goes in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Floyd wants to make that fight happened.</v>

1580
01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:45.950
<v Speaker 1>Call me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dana is a businessman.</v>

1581
01:09:46.010 --> 01:09:47.330
<v Speaker 1>They care about money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know big.</v>

1582
01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:49.280
<v Speaker 1>That fight would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much money do you think they could</v>

1583
01:09:49.281 --> 01:09:53.780
<v Speaker 1>make if floyd mayweather fights conor</v>
<v Speaker 1>mcgregor biggest biggest paper of all</v>

1584
01:09:53.781 --> 01:09:55.350
<v Speaker 1>time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1585
01:09:55.770 --> 01:09:58.880
<v Speaker 1>you don't think so?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's of yet?</v>

1586
01:09:59.110 --> 01:10:04.110
<v Speaker 1>It might be</v>
<v Speaker 1>the biggest draw already in ufc mma</v>

1587
01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:07.050
<v Speaker 1>made,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's the biggest paper,</v>

1588
01:10:07.060 --> 01:10:09.770
<v Speaker 1>you draw a box and ball time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mixed the world.</v>

1589
01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:11.810
<v Speaker 1>Everyone would tune in including your</v>
<v Speaker 1>dad.</v>

1590
01:10:11.900 --> 01:10:16.040
<v Speaker 1>I would you tell them you wouldn't do an</v>
<v Speaker 1>end now because you're so full of.</v>

1591
01:10:17.430 --> 01:10:21.760
<v Speaker 1>Should very unInteresting taken two hits</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of the little baby face.</v>

1592
01:10:22.250 --> 01:10:24.330
<v Speaker 1>If I know it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fascinating.</v>

1593
01:10:24.340 --> 01:10:25.870
<v Speaker 1>This spark joy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1594
01:10:25.890 --> 01:10:29.300
<v Speaker 1>So what would happen is floyd mayweather</v>
<v Speaker 1>would box with conor mcgregor and</v>

1595
01:10:29.301 --> 01:10:31.070
<v Speaker 1>basically move around and be like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>god's going to be a spectacle.</v>

1597
01:10:32.660 --> 01:10:35.570
<v Speaker 1>It's just not a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't be a fight where you were</v>

1598
01:10:35.571 --> 01:10:38.320
<v Speaker 1>fucking party pooper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1599

<v Speaker 1>And then our cheer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1600
01:10:39.910 --> 01:10:44.720
<v Speaker 1>This is the thing you gotta remember the</v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing that dana and floyd mayweather</v>

1601
01:10:44.721 --> 01:10:47.060
<v Speaker 1>who would be responsible in this fight</v>
<v Speaker 1>together and connor,</v>

1602
01:10:47.061 --> 01:10:49.850
<v Speaker 1>for that matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all they care about is money and</v>

1603
01:10:49.851 --> 01:10:53.510
<v Speaker 1>numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That fight would be money and fucKing</v>

1604
01:10:53.511 --> 01:10:54.380
<v Speaker 1>numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would break.</v>

1605
01:10:54.381 --> 01:10:55.700
<v Speaker 1>Pack you all made with the kennedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1606
01:10:55.701 --> 01:10:57.950
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I'm saying is that how would,</v>

1607
01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:00.040
<v Speaker 1>how would they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how would that fight come?</v>

1608
01:11:00.090 --> 01:11:03.230
<v Speaker 1>What would they do in that fight?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So floyd probably can knock them out</v>

1609
01:11:03.260 --> 01:11:04.190
<v Speaker 1>anytime he wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1610
01:11:04.430 --> 01:11:05.810
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1611
01:11:06.020 --> 01:11:09.620
<v Speaker 1>Connor has a very good chin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean kinda got knocked up by nate diaz</v>

1612
01:11:09.621 --> 01:11:12.770
<v Speaker 1>or he got knocked down and hurt and</v>
<v Speaker 1>wobbled by nate diaz.</v>

1613
01:11:12.771 --> 01:11:13.604
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1614
01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:15.720
<v Speaker 2>Little gloves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

1615
01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:18.030
<v Speaker 2>native.</v>
<v Speaker 2>ReallY good puncher needs a big guy,</v>

1616
01:11:18.250 --> 01:11:19.780
<v Speaker 2>a nate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nate's fought at one 70.</v>

1617
01:11:19.781 --> 01:11:21.840
<v Speaker 2>He's a lot bigger than floyd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like physically alive.</v>

1618
01:11:22.890 --> 01:11:26.460
<v Speaker 2>but floyd is a guy who's broken his</v>
<v Speaker 2>hands many,</v>

1619
01:11:26.461 --> 01:11:31.080
<v Speaker 2>many times and he's not known for really</v>
<v Speaker 2>uncorking all of his might and trying to</v>

1620
01:11:31.081 --> 01:11:32.880
<v Speaker 2>knock it down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>knock out artists in the least bit.</v>

1621
01:11:32.910 --> 01:11:35.370
<v Speaker 2>But he could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he certainly could.</v>

1622
01:11:35.570 --> 01:11:36.301
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>

1623
01:11:36.301 --> 01:11:40.770
<v Speaker 2>The floor doesn't hit real hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you box real smart knockouts</v>

1624
01:11:40.771 --> 01:11:43.080
<v Speaker 2>come,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the opportunity comes like the ricky</v>

1625
01:11:43.081 --> 01:11:44.670
<v Speaker 2>hatton fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That'S a perfect example.</v>

1626
01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:46.350
<v Speaker 2>That knockout came.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

1627
01:11:46.351 --> 01:11:48.410
<v Speaker 2>It sound like he went looking for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>victor or five.</v>

1628
01:11:48.450 --> 01:11:50.690
<v Speaker 2>Victor just fucked up and he just left</v>
<v Speaker 2>hook right hand.</v>

1629
01:11:50.691 --> 01:11:51.511
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was,</v>

1630
01:11:51.511 --> 01:11:53.790
<v Speaker 2>he was a total sucker punch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you had no idea what was going on</v>

1631
01:11:53.870 --> 01:11:55.850
<v Speaker 2>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Has issues of scale,</v>

1632
01:11:55.970 --> 01:11:56.810
<v Speaker 2>like madonna.</v>

1633
01:11:57.050 --> 01:12:02.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you suggest the first fight he</v>
<v Speaker 2>box the shit out of them did.</v>

1634
01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:04.140
<v Speaker 2>But it may dilute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if,</v>

1635
01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:06.450
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I was college coaching that fight</v>

1636
01:12:06.451 --> 01:12:07.500
<v Speaker 2>were to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1637
01:12:07.530 --> 01:12:09.820
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't be pretty thin on the outside and</v>

1638
01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:11.510
<v Speaker 2>hit this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We make this a dogfight.</v>

1639
01:12:11.570 --> 01:12:14.280
<v Speaker 2>You're the bigger guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think connor would actually give</v>

1640
01:12:14.460 --> 01:12:16.950
<v Speaker 2>floyd mayweather a boxing match?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is tHat what I'm hearing?</v>

1641
01:12:17.130 --> 01:12:18.960
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not what anybody's saying.</v>

1642
01:12:18.990 --> 01:12:20.530
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the thing we're saying that he's</v>

1643
01:12:20.531 --> 01:12:22.980
<v Speaker 2>the biggest straw and saying that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't think floyd would juSt go out and</v>

1644
01:12:22.981 --> 01:12:27.030
<v Speaker 2>try to knock them out in the box.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you Would canelo alvarez them,</v>

1645
01:12:27.031 --> 01:12:30.420
<v Speaker 2>but key obviously canelo's way more</v>
<v Speaker 2>skillful in boxing.</v>

1646
01:12:30.421 --> 01:12:33.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean canelo is a world champion.</v>

1647
01:12:33.541 --> 01:12:35.640
<v Speaker 2>One punch knockout artists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boxer.</v>

1648
01:12:35.641 --> 01:12:38.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean that fucking amir khan knockout.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey jesus.</v>

1649
01:12:38.620 --> 01:12:39.720
<v Speaker 2>Louise's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1650
01:12:39.890 --> 01:12:43.800
<v Speaker 2>was a super fucking home run on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>button.</v>

1651
01:12:43.830 --> 01:12:45.690
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>floyd got hit.</v>

1652
01:12:45.810 --> 01:12:49.290
<v Speaker 2>He said after he got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When he fought canelo he got punched in</v>

1653
01:12:49.291 --> 01:12:52.500
<v Speaker 2>the thigh by canelo had trouble walking</v>
<v Speaker 2>for two days.</v>

1654
01:12:52.501 --> 01:12:55.440
<v Speaker 2>He literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he didn't show it after the fight.</v>

1655
01:12:55.441 --> 01:12:55.951
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

1656
01:12:55.951 --> 01:12:58.860
<v Speaker 2>my thigh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He punched me in the thigh so hard.</v>

1657
01:12:58.861 --> 01:13:00.860
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am having trouble walking that to</v>

1658
01:13:00.890 --> 01:13:02.790
<v Speaker 2>live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lloyd is never going to fight mma</v>

1659
01:13:02.820 --> 01:13:06.810
<v Speaker 2>because if connor would fucking break</v>
<v Speaker 2>his legs like literally mma be.</v>

1660
01:13:07.230 --> 01:13:10.360
<v Speaker 2>It would be more embarraSsing than tonic</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing just box.</v>

1661
01:13:10.930 --> 01:13:14.160
<v Speaker 2>He would get way more embarrassing</v>
<v Speaker 2>because is a big guy.</v>

1662
01:13:14.780 --> 01:13:17.640
<v Speaker 2>Employed would have to like box smart</v>
<v Speaker 2>alec connor.</v>

1663
01:13:17.790 --> 01:13:22.650
<v Speaker 2>I think kinda would have just</v>
<v Speaker 2>unbelievably difficult time even coming</v>

1664
01:13:22.651 --> 01:13:24.080
<v Speaker 2>close to hitting him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I man,</v>

1665
01:13:24.110 --> 01:13:27.000
<v Speaker 2>I think he's gonna straight boxing with</v>
<v Speaker 2>grazing stuff.</v>

1666
01:13:27.030 --> 01:13:29.520
<v Speaker 2>He's probably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're Talking about if not the greatest</v>

1667
01:13:29.521 --> 01:13:31.170
<v Speaker 2>boxer of all time and his defense is</v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

1668
01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:33.450
<v Speaker 2>It would be a great show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a good.</v>

1669
01:13:33.730 --> 01:13:38.070
<v Speaker 2>It'd be the best defense ever for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's on the fence in floyd and now</v>

1670
01:13:38.071 --> 01:13:42.240
<v Speaker 2>you're taking a guy who he's an elite</v>
<v Speaker 2>strike in the ufc but boxing's a</v>

1671
01:13:42.241 --> 01:13:43.680
<v Speaker 2>different game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

1672
01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:44.471
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would.</v>

1673
01:13:44.471 --> 01:13:48.690
<v Speaker 2>Would've loved to seen canelo fight</v>
<v Speaker 2>floyd like in a couple of years when</v>

1674
01:13:48.691 --> 01:13:53.691
<v Speaker 2>canelo's like 27,</v>
<v Speaker 2>28 when he has the experience because I</v>

1675
01:13:54.031 --> 01:13:57.640
<v Speaker 2>think like if you look at like sugar ray</v>
<v Speaker 2>leonard versus roberto duran,</v>

1676
01:13:57.690 --> 01:14:02.690
<v Speaker 2>like both guys were like really in their</v>
<v Speaker 2>prime experience world in big.</v>

1677
01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:07.590
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes like your prime comes early,</v>

1678
01:14:07.620 --> 01:14:10.530
<v Speaker 2>like tyson and sometimes you prime comes</v>
<v Speaker 2>later,</v>

1679
01:14:10.620 --> 01:14:13.800
<v Speaker 2>you know bernard hopkins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when a guy's in his prime,</v>

1680
01:14:13.801 --> 01:14:16.390
<v Speaker 2>he know he's in his prime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think canelo wasn't in his prime when</v>

1681
01:14:16.391 --> 01:14:17.860
<v Speaker 2>he fought for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I still don't.</v>

1682
01:14:17.910 --> 01:14:21.640
<v Speaker 2>I think he's getting there and if I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>canelo's management and as a fan I won't</v>

1683
01:14:21.641 --> 01:14:24.640
<v Speaker 2>see canelo triple g and greg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they say canal is probably gonna have to</v>

1684
01:14:24.641 --> 01:14:25.360
<v Speaker 2>vacate and his belt.</v>

1685
01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:27.360
<v Speaker 2>If he doesn't fight triple g,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what they're saying.</v>

1686
01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:28.233
<v Speaker 2>But that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>

1687
01:14:28.270 --> 01:14:31.030
<v Speaker 2>why does he want 1:55 that's not</v>
<v Speaker 2>middleweight.</v>

1688
01:14:31.060 --> 01:14:35.080
<v Speaker 2>Like why are they sending it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is making all these fights at 1:55 and</v>

1689
01:14:35.081 --> 01:14:37.390
<v Speaker 2>they're calling a middleweight because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's over 1:54.</v>

1690
01:14:37.590 --> 01:14:39.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have a weird thing going on.</v>

1691
01:14:39.550 --> 01:14:42.490
<v Speaker 2>That's what's wrong with boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if i'M canelo's camp,</v>

1692
01:14:42.940 --> 01:14:44.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sending that fight up yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

<v Speaker 2>and because also you gotta remember</v>

<v Speaker 2>We know him.</v>

1699
01:14:56.560 --> 01:14:58.030
<v Speaker 2>We're in the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not a draw at all.</v>

1700
01:14:58.270 --> 01:15:02.740
<v Speaker 2>His paper you did I think 125,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>175,000 and then listen,</v>

1701
01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:08.040
<v Speaker 2>big drama show big drama drama show soon</v>
<v Speaker 2>as the belt series business.</v>

1702
01:15:09.710 --> 01:15:11.050
<v Speaker 2>That guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's awesome,</v>

1703
01:15:11.580 --> 01:15:13.000
<v Speaker 2>but he's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just not like a,</v>

1704
01:15:13.210 --> 01:15:15.490
<v Speaker 2>as far as being a paper view,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drawing power.</v>

1705
01:15:15.491 --> 01:15:19.300
<v Speaker 2>He's not there yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the new 30 and knock him the fuck</v>

1706
01:15:19.301 --> 01:15:20.134
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He won't do it.</v>

1707
01:15:20.430 --> 01:15:23.290
<v Speaker 2>He won't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You toss canelo like lemieux or someone</v>

1708
01:15:23.291 --> 01:15:25.510
<v Speaker 2>else so you can just merch and keep</v>
<v Speaker 2>building his name.</v>

1709
01:15:25.540 --> 01:15:27.670
<v Speaker 2>well he wants to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1710
01:15:27.790 --> 01:15:30.790
<v Speaker 2>he wanted to be one 60 and canelo wants</v>
<v Speaker 2>it to be 1:55.</v>

1711
01:15:30.820 --> 01:15:33.400
<v Speaker 2>Apparently that's a hold up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1712
01:15:33.700 --> 01:15:35.230
<v Speaker 2>he triples.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a bigger guy.</v>

1713
01:15:35.610 --> 01:15:37.840
<v Speaker 2>If triple g has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she dropped down five pounds,</v>

1714
01:15:37.841 --> 01:15:39.190
<v Speaker 2>they think it'll be enough to weaken</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

1715
01:15:39.191 --> 01:15:41.080
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe canelo can have a chance and they</v>

1716
01:15:41.081 --> 01:15:44.890
<v Speaker 2>can slug it out in the trenches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But If you look at the fight,</v>

1717
01:15:45.130 --> 01:15:50.130
<v Speaker 2>the actual fight itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when amir khan just fought canelo,</v>

1718
01:15:50.291 --> 01:15:53.950
<v Speaker 2>he did expose that speed and movement</v>
<v Speaker 2>are still a problem.</v>

1719
01:15:54.010 --> 01:15:54.850
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just,</v>

1720
01:15:54.851 --> 01:15:56.650
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't have the same speed or the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same movement.</v>

1721
01:15:56.651 --> 01:15:59.560
<v Speaker 2>It's floyd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but his speed and movement were a bit of</v>

1722
01:15:59.561 --> 01:16:00.970
<v Speaker 2>a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have some real issues,</v>

1723
01:16:01.210 --> 01:16:02.950
<v Speaker 2>some real estate to his landing all</v>
<v Speaker 2>night.</v>

1724
01:16:02.980 --> 01:16:04.510
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially in the first round.</v>

1725
01:16:04.540 --> 01:16:06.550
<v Speaker 2>The first round he lit him up with some</v>
<v Speaker 2>straight right hand.</v>

1726
01:16:06.551 --> 01:16:07.361
<v Speaker 2>So that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ooo,</v>

1727
01:16:07.361 --> 01:16:09.430
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how's this gonna play out?</v>

1728
01:16:09.730 --> 01:16:12.550
<v Speaker 2>But I think that there is no one else in</v>
<v Speaker 2>that division that can do that.</v>

1729
01:16:12.610 --> 01:16:15.650
<v Speaker 2>Photo couldn't do it to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Canelo outbox codo mean.</v>

1730
01:16:15.820 --> 01:16:18.100
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then floyd was really the only guy</v>

1731
01:16:18.101 --> 01:16:19.360
<v Speaker 2>to expose it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But floyd floyd,</v>

1732
01:16:19.361 --> 01:16:22.040
<v Speaker 2>there's no other floyd's yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So who the fuck else is in the division?</v>

1733
01:16:22.060 --> 01:16:27.060
<v Speaker 2>But I think triple g canelo right now is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it'd be a bad decision for canelo</v>

1734
01:16:27.090 --> 01:16:31.870
<v Speaker 2>will terrence crawford is 1:47,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so talented 1:47 and one slash four and</v>

1735
01:16:31.871 --> 01:16:32.940
<v Speaker 2>next door neighbors my.</v>

1736
01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:33.880
<v Speaker 2>OH,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here it is.</v>

1737
01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:35.530
<v Speaker 2>They fight over like two and three</v>
<v Speaker 2>pounds.</v>

1738
01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:38.410
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can make the weight different than mma</v>

1739
01:16:38.411 --> 01:16:39.850
<v Speaker 2>in that regard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So weird mma,</v>

1740
01:16:39.851 --> 01:16:42.460
<v Speaker 2>you're dealing with a middle way to</v>
<v Speaker 2>light heavyweight,</v>

1741
01:16:42.461 --> 01:16:46.120
<v Speaker 2>which guys jumped back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You dealing with 20 fucking pounds.</v>

1742
01:16:46.450 --> 01:16:47.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's madness.</v>

1743
01:16:47.730 --> 01:16:49.910
<v Speaker 2>Be more away classes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1744
01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:53.380
<v Speaker 2>I've been saying this from the jump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There should be a weight class every 10</v>

1745
01:16:53.381 --> 01:16:54.640
<v Speaker 2>pounds and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1746
01:16:54.641 --> 01:16:56.320
<v Speaker 2>if there's too many champions in waters</v>
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>

1747
01:16:56.410 --> 01:17:00.040
<v Speaker 2>I completely disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're telling me some of these amazing</v>

1748
01:17:00.041 --> 01:17:03.280
<v Speaker 2>fighters that you have that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>superstars like a donald cerrone,</v>

1749
01:17:03.550 --> 01:17:06.080
<v Speaker 2>like a diego sanchez,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like all these different guys,</v>

1750
01:17:06.081 --> 01:17:07.270
<v Speaker 2>so it was just so amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guys.</v>

1751
01:17:07.271 --> 01:17:10.040
<v Speaker 2>I've never won a title that are huge</v>
<v Speaker 2>favorites,</v>

1752
01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:11.750
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you look at all these different guys,</v>

1753
01:17:11.900 --> 01:17:14.600
<v Speaker 3>uriah favors and other ones you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>telling me those guys couldn't have been</v>

1754
01:17:14.601 --> 01:17:19.580
<v Speaker 3>champions and you wouldn't have had even</v>
<v Speaker 3>more champions and an even crazier thing</v>

1755
01:17:19.581 --> 01:17:22.170
<v Speaker 3>if there were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If there was a weight class every teN</v>

1756
01:17:22.170 --> 01:17:25.210
<v Speaker 3>pounds and a better product a better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're getting better performances from</v>

1757
01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:28.190
<v Speaker 3>because donald's not destroying his body</v>
<v Speaker 3>to make 55.</v>

1758
01:17:28.191 --> 01:17:31.430
<v Speaker 3>You're not having these monsters make</v>
<v Speaker 3>these weight classes and the actual</v>

1759
01:17:31.431 --> 01:17:33.680
<v Speaker 3>world champions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's sponsorships.</v>

1760
01:17:33.780 --> 01:17:36.950
<v Speaker 3>So enough weight classes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's classes two.</v>

1761
01:17:36.951 --> 01:17:37.351
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>six,</v>

1762
01:17:37.351 --> 01:17:38.210
<v Speaker 3>two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two 65.</v>

1763
01:17:38.211 --> 01:17:39.830
<v Speaker 3>How dare you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

1764
01:17:39.831 --> 01:17:41.860
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy,</v>

1765
01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:42.810
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tim?</v>

1766
01:17:42.810 --> 01:17:45.050
<v Speaker 3>It too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what's interesting is the best guys</v>

1767
01:17:45.051 --> 01:17:50.051
<v Speaker 3>seem to like flatten out around 2:42.</v>
<v Speaker 3>so my thought is let's make a to 40,</v>

1768
01:17:50.270 --> 01:17:55.270
<v Speaker 3>let's make that heavyweight and then two</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a half to two to 40 to 65 or a</v>

1769
01:17:55.631 --> 01:17:56.270
<v Speaker 3>little champions.</v>

1770
01:17:56.270 --> 01:17:57.470
<v Speaker 3>The better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the way up.</v>

1771
01:17:59.290 --> 01:18:02.910
<v Speaker 3>The only time you Can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a little bit of a problem.</v>

1772
01:18:03.310 --> 01:18:05.150
<v Speaker 3>A problem is with cyborg,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1773
01:18:05.151 --> 01:18:06.740
<v Speaker 3>Because she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she goes,</v>

1774
01:18:06.741 --> 01:18:10.730
<v Speaker 3>I'll fight anyone at 1:40,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at one forties have I heard from my</v>

1775
01:18:10.731 --> 01:18:12.410
<v Speaker 3>source?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a beast for it to get to.</v>

1776
01:18:12.420 --> 01:18:15.620
<v Speaker 3>I think she's the 1:45 pound invicta</v>
<v Speaker 3>champion.</v>

1777
01:18:15.621 --> 01:18:20.621
<v Speaker 3>They have a 1:35 in the ufc 1:45 and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think you can do 1:40 5:40.</v>

1778
01:18:21.081 --> 01:18:23.060
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But why do it?</v>

1779
01:18:23.061 --> 01:18:25.340
<v Speaker 3>Why maker make it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's a 1:45 pound champ.</v>

1780
01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:27.620
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's not a lot of all the</v>

1781
01:18:27.621 --> 01:18:31.580
<v Speaker 3>superstars on 1:35 can make 1:40 to make</v>
<v Speaker 3>them put on 10 pounds.</v>

1782
01:18:31.581 --> 01:18:36.581
<v Speaker 3>Ever build it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They will come have right now mr rogen</v>

1783
01:18:37.270 --> 01:18:39.410
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You understand she's the invicta</v>

1784
01:18:39.411 --> 01:18:41.270
<v Speaker 3>champion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so she's fighting people in invicta.</v>

1785
01:18:41.570 --> 01:18:42.730
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1786
01:18:42.740 --> 01:18:43.573
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's true.</v>

1787
01:18:43.910 --> 01:18:45.350
<v Speaker 3>She's better than all of them anyway.</v>

1788
01:18:45.460 --> 01:18:48.050
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you shouldn't be forcing her to kill</v>

1789
01:18:48.051 --> 01:18:50.330
<v Speaker 3>herself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When 1:45 is already established.</v>

1790
01:18:50.331 --> 01:18:52.880
<v Speaker 3>Weight class.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Misha tate was the 1:45 pound champion.</v>

1791
01:18:52.890 --> 01:18:54.040
<v Speaker 3>Strikeforce.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's good point.</v>

1792
01:18:54.050 --> 01:18:56.170
<v Speaker 3>Established way that you would fight or</v>
<v Speaker 3>two.</v>

1793
01:18:56.870 --> 01:18:59.480
<v Speaker 3>It's an established weight class,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think at 1:40 though.</v>

1794
01:18:59.660 --> 01:19:01.880
<v Speaker 3>Well listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>holly homes for people in boxing as high</v>

1795
01:19:01.881 --> 01:19:05.440
<v Speaker 3>as 1:52.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's 1:45 and established weight class</v>

1796
01:19:05.770 --> 01:19:08.760
<v Speaker 3>to sign up the house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How doeS holly holm do cyborg?</v>

1797
01:19:08.950 --> 01:19:13.850
<v Speaker 3>A holly holm as his.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She has the best chance because cyborg</v>

1798
01:19:13.851 --> 01:19:17.390
<v Speaker 3>is a ruthless marauder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's berserker a tower.</v>

1799
01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:19.540
<v Speaker 3>Shoot the box style.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not this last night.</v>

1800
01:19:19.620 --> 01:19:20.860
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she wasn't this last site.</v>

1801
01:19:21.470 --> 01:19:24.140
<v Speaker 3>Who will and those hits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1802
01:19:24.141 --> 01:19:28.010
<v Speaker 3>oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That counter that counter right hands</v>

1803
01:19:28.011 --> 01:19:30.310
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let's fix these card.</v>

1804
01:19:31.010 --> 01:19:32.810
<v Speaker 3>Nice hard core.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's mad at thomas.</v>

1805
01:19:32.930 --> 01:19:33.870
<v Speaker 3>She's a beast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She should.</v>

1806
01:19:34.070 --> 01:19:36.020
<v Speaker 3>She should.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She should.</v>

1807
01:19:36.050 --> 01:19:37.700
<v Speaker 3>She should definitely thanked the</v>
<v Speaker 3>referee.</v>

1808
01:19:37.790 --> 01:19:39.520
<v Speaker 3>The referee saved her from herself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1809
01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:42.500
<v Speaker 3>but she's just so tough fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's so tough that you want.</v>

1810
01:19:42.740 --> 01:19:44.260
<v Speaker 3>She wanted to go out on our shield.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1811
01:19:44.370 --> 01:19:47.360
<v Speaker 3>She was already gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She doesn't understand ground and pound.</v>

1812
01:19:47.390 --> 01:19:52.390
<v Speaker 3>That shit is ill fate or days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was punching him in the face.</v>

1813
01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:57.880
<v Speaker 3>She's so much more advanced than anybody</v>
<v Speaker 3>else creates so much more to perillo.</v>

1814
01:19:58.950 --> 01:20:00.800
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's different than holly.</v>

1815
01:20:00.830 --> 01:20:03.770
<v Speaker 3>Completely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holly is a counter striker and holly</v>

1816
01:20:03.771 --> 01:20:08.670
<v Speaker 3>also had a really brutal knockout in</v>
<v Speaker 3>boxing against a larger woman and have</v>

1817
01:20:08.700 --> 01:20:09.600
<v Speaker 3>watched it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1818
01:20:09.601 --> 01:20:12.810
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the kind of knockout that you never</v>

1819
01:20:12.811 --> 01:20:17.300
<v Speaker 3>really fight that way again because you</v>
<v Speaker 3>realize the consequences now and like</v>

1820
01:20:17.301 --> 01:20:19.930
<v Speaker 3>someone gets brutally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>brutally knocked out there,</v>

1821
01:20:19.950 --> 01:20:24.330
<v Speaker 3>aware of that as a consequence and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think she's become much more of a</v>

1822
01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:27.610
<v Speaker 3>defensive minded counter striker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was super effective against ronda</v>

1823
01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:29.040
<v Speaker 3>better I think for her.</v>

1824
01:20:29.060 --> 01:20:30.960
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it didn't look so good against misha</v>

1825
01:20:31.170 --> 01:20:34.620
<v Speaker 3>because misha was fighting super smart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was also.</v>

1826
01:20:35.850 --> 01:20:37.740
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's also because misha doesn't rush</v>

1827
01:20:37.741 --> 01:20:42.110
<v Speaker 3>after all your anxiety on the outside</v>
<v Speaker 3>flat.</v>

1828
01:20:42.150 --> 01:20:44.220
<v Speaker 3>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I also thought for whatever reason</v>

1829
01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:47.190
<v Speaker 3>holly didn't fight like herself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She doesn't like was it pulling the</v>

1830
01:20:47.191 --> 01:20:49.560
<v Speaker 3>trigger?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She doesn't like to lead to lead and</v>

1831
01:20:49.561 --> 01:20:52.290
<v Speaker 3>she's worried about being taken down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once she got taken down by me shaLl we</v>

1832
01:20:52.291 --> 01:20:54.110
<v Speaker 3>realized why she doesn't like to lead</v>
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>

1833
01:20:54.120 --> 01:20:55.920
<v Speaker 3>should took her down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>beat the shit out of her on the ground,</v>

1834
01:20:55.921 --> 01:20:59.930
<v Speaker 3>like destroyed her in that second round</v>
<v Speaker 3>was on top of or most of the round just</v>

1835
01:20:59.940 --> 01:21:01.710
<v Speaker 3>beating her ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we knew,</v>

1836
01:21:01.711 --> 01:21:02.850
<v Speaker 3>look of me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she gets her down,</v>

1837
01:21:02.851 --> 01:21:05.010
<v Speaker 3>she's fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then she fights like a,</v>

1838
01:21:05.070 --> 01:21:07.500
<v Speaker 3>like a craftsman to the third and fourth</v>
<v Speaker 3>round.</v>

1839
01:21:07.501 --> 01:21:10.110
<v Speaker 3>She just fights real smart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stays on the outside edges,</v>

1840
01:21:10.111 --> 01:21:10.944
<v Speaker 3>those rounds.</v>

1841
01:21:10.980 --> 01:21:13.830
<v Speaker 3>And then she's forced to go for broke</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the fifth and mission wound up</v>

1842
01:21:13.831 --> 01:21:15.780
<v Speaker 3>taking her out and choking.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's taken so long for her to finally</v>

1858

01:25:22.210 --> 01:25:24.390
<v Speaker 1>I disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the brazilian colona</v>

1940
01:25:27.590 --> 01:25:30.840
<v Speaker 1>colona</v>
<v Speaker 1>boom by,</v>

1941
01:25:31.220 --> 01:25:34.360
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's boom by a bom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dia.</v>

1942
01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:37.530
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about matt brown could have gotten</v>

1943
01:25:37.570 --> 01:25:38.230
<v Speaker 1>any worse?</v>

1944
01:25:38.230 --> 01:25:42.130
<v Speaker 1>I didn't say it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My fucking my goddamn dvr fucked up.</v>

1945
01:25:42.131 --> 01:25:45.550
<v Speaker 1>Somehow my kids put like max and ruby on</v>
<v Speaker 1>or some shit,</v>

1946
01:25:46.760 --> 01:25:47.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1947
01:25:47.380 --> 01:25:50.080
<v Speaker 1>like sometimes people try to have two</v>
<v Speaker 1>things being taped.</v>

1948
01:25:50.150 --> 01:25:52.210
<v Speaker 1>It stops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My wife will move up.</v>

1949
01:25:52.270 --> 01:25:55.540
<v Speaker 1>The kid shows to the top of the order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I didn't,</v>

1950
01:25:55.541 --> 01:25:59.120
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even watch this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he gets fucked up by the fans and</v>

1951
01:25:59.121 --> 01:26:01.690
<v Speaker 1>they kicked this fan out by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fifth punched him in the face</v>

1952
01:26:01.930 --> 01:26:03.560
<v Speaker 1>because he's flipping everyone off weigh</v>
<v Speaker 1>ins.</v>

1953
01:26:04.130 --> 01:26:07.310
<v Speaker 1>And then his old coach after the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was in their head,</v>

1954
01:26:07.311 --> 01:26:08.170
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got mad.</v>

1955
01:26:08.210 --> 01:26:10.730
<v Speaker 1>A couple guys smacked him in the head</v>
<v Speaker 1>they took.</v>

1956
01:26:10.731 --> 01:26:12.350
<v Speaker 1>They took that dude out of the arena</v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

1957
01:26:12.980 --> 01:26:14.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But a couple of guys smacked him in the</v>

1958
01:26:14.511 --> 01:26:16.550
<v Speaker 1>head as he's running in before the guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>punched him.</v>

1959
01:26:16.551 --> 01:26:18.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying they took one of the guys out</v>
<v Speaker 1>to smack them.</v>

1960
01:26:18.770 --> 01:26:20.390
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did they really should have taken all of</v>

1961
01:26:20.391 --> 01:26:21.160
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

1962
01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:22.610
<v Speaker 1>Stupid.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1966
01:26:28.101 --> 01:26:30.170
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he uncorked a bomb on someone's face.</v>

1967
01:26:30.180 --> 01:26:32.240
<v Speaker 1>Damien maia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>matt brown in the face.</v>

1968
01:26:32.870 --> 01:26:35.770
<v Speaker 1>Damien maia said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>welcome to my country about to choke.</v>

01:26:35.830 --> 01:26:37.880
<v Speaker 1>So I love to see the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

1973
01:26:42.290 --> 01:26:46.640

<v Speaker 1>He's in the hotel and his old coach</v>

1974
01:26:46.700 --> 01:26:48.830
<v Speaker 1>sucker punched in back of the head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I heard.</v>

1975
01:26:48.860 --> 01:26:53.840
<v Speaker 1>And then got his old coaches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>old brown brown's old grappling punch</v>

1976
01:26:53.870 --> 01:26:55.490
<v Speaker 1>sucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Punched him back in the head and then he</v>

1977
01:26:55.491 --> 01:26:56.900
<v Speaker 1>runs off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh no,</v>

1978
01:26:56.901 --> 01:26:58.910
<v Speaker 1>you ain't running because matt brennan's</v>
<v Speaker 1>coaches around.</v>

1979
01:26:58.911 --> 01:27:02.870
<v Speaker 1>Lisa bowling is other coach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They catch this dude beat the brakes off</v>

1980
01:27:02.871 --> 01:27:04.070
<v Speaker 1>of him and got arrested.</v>

1981
01:27:04.100 --> 01:27:06.190
<v Speaker 1>Read harris was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1982
01:27:06.210 --> 01:27:08.310
<v Speaker 1>just went all aggro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Caught the studio.</v>

1983
01:27:08.650 --> 01:27:10.100
<v Speaker 1>Why they punched him in the back of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>head?</v>

1984
01:27:10.460 --> 01:27:13.100
<v Speaker 1>Because they have a history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What an asshole.</v>

1985
01:27:13.370 --> 01:27:15.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but can you get a p on my big huge dick?</v>

1986
01:27:15.321 --> 01:27:18.590
<v Speaker 1>I'll be right back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let us know about it.</v>

1987
01:27:18.680 --> 01:27:23.000
<v Speaker 1>Thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's all trimmed up,</v>

1988
01:27:23.001 --> 01:27:24.120
<v Speaker 1>huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1989
01:27:24.620 --> 01:27:26.750
<v Speaker 1>How much does he lost?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I swear to god.</v>

1990
01:27:26.751 --> 01:27:31.640
<v Speaker 1>He's got to be usually walked around at</v>
<v Speaker 1>2:55 and every bit he's probably to 40</v>

1991
01:27:31.641 --> 01:27:33.890
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has it made you think about changing</v>

1992
01:27:33.891 --> 01:27:36.380
<v Speaker 1>your diet now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You like eating bread and shit?</v>

1993
01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:39.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do well with carbs like rice and eat</v>

1994
01:27:39.180 --> 01:27:40.730
<v Speaker 1>pretty clean rice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Potatoes.</v>

1995
01:27:40.731 --> 01:27:41.481
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind it.</v>

1996
01:27:41.481 --> 01:27:43.520
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I'm the body type.</v>

1997
01:27:43.521 --> 01:27:44.960
<v Speaker 1>I think I'd get even skinnier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

1998
01:27:44.990 --> 01:27:45.620
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1999
01:27:45.620 --> 01:27:48.140
<v Speaker 1>for me I need all the carbs I can get.</v>

2000
01:27:48.140 --> 01:27:52.190
<v Speaker 1>I sleep well on carbs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever tried not having them?</v>

2001
01:27:52.850 --> 01:27:54.200
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how do you know?</v>

2002
01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:55.350
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I have though.</v>

2003
01:27:55.370 --> 01:27:56.420
<v Speaker 1>Actually that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

2004
01:27:56.421 --> 01:27:59.150
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I stay very far away from sugar to them,</v>

2005
01:27:59.151 --> 01:28:02.030
<v Speaker 1>but that's I think the most important</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing to sugar.</v>

2006
01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:05.180
<v Speaker 1>That's what I was telling people when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>moved the first attempt at doing</v>

2007
01:28:05.181 --> 01:28:05.950
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went,</v>

2008
01:28:05.950 --> 01:28:07.610
<v Speaker 1>I tried gluten,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no gluten,</v>

2009
01:28:07.850 --> 01:28:09.830
<v Speaker 1>but I think the real issue is I wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating bread,</v>

2010
01:28:10.150 --> 01:28:12.200
<v Speaker 1>so if I'm eating bread I'm not getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>sugar.</v>

2011
01:28:12.230 --> 01:28:13.520
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2012
01:28:13.521 --> 01:28:16.070
<v Speaker 1>And when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't eat a lot of bread because</v>

2013
01:28:16.071 --> 01:28:20.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm aware of because I monitor my body</v>
<v Speaker 1>like so if I eat two slices,</v>

2014
01:28:20.271 --> 01:28:24.770
<v Speaker 1>even if really good bread,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I notice that my energy kind of.</v>

2015
01:28:24.860 --> 01:28:27.170
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same as if I eat slow</v>
<v Speaker 1>cooked oatmeal,</v>

2016
01:28:27.350 --> 01:28:28.610
<v Speaker 1>I feel really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2017
01:28:29.460 --> 01:28:29.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2018
01:28:29.720 --> 01:28:33.650
<v Speaker 1>There's definitely some spikes going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Insulin spikes going on when you eat</v>

2019
01:28:33.651 --> 01:28:35.900
<v Speaker 1>sugar and you eat bread and we're just</v>
<v Speaker 1>used to them.</v>

2020
01:28:36.330 --> 01:28:38.360
<v Speaker 1>Remember I only eat a lot either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the other thing.</v>

2021
01:28:38.361 --> 01:28:39.450
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a big deal.</v>

2022
01:28:39.500 --> 01:28:42.140
<v Speaker 1>We got to fight and here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Damien maia and matt brown.</v>

2023
01:28:43.050 --> 01:28:44.780
<v Speaker 1>This is around three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2024
01:28:45.290 --> 01:28:46.670
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what was going on before</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2025
01:28:46.671 --> 01:28:50.330
<v Speaker 1>but we assume it was good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't look too sprawling.</v>

2026
01:28:51.290 --> 01:28:53.540
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to keep it standing up with</v>

2027
01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:55.280
<v Speaker 1>damien.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maia is doing a good job of standing on</v>

2028
01:28:55.281 --> 01:28:59.030
<v Speaker 1>the outside of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's making it a real obvious that</v>

2029
01:28:59.031 --> 01:29:02.040
<v Speaker 1>he wants to take them down and shoots in</v>
<v Speaker 1>as move away from the</v>

2030
01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:03.990
<v Speaker 2>keck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's so big at one 70.</v>

2031
01:29:03.991 --> 01:29:06.750
<v Speaker 2>My miles a beast at one 70.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never seen him in person.</v>

2032
01:29:06.920 --> 01:29:08.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean you fought for the title at one</v>
<v Speaker 2>85.</v>

2033
01:29:08.551 --> 01:29:09.950
<v Speaker 2>Who's a big guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoo.</v>

2034
01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:12.180
<v Speaker 2>Good job there by mine and he tries to</v>
<v Speaker 2>take down again.</v>

2035
01:29:12.820 --> 01:29:15.360
<v Speaker 2>Matt brown punches him and matt brown</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets on top.</v>

2036
01:29:15.361 --> 01:29:16.500
<v Speaker 2>This is where you fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2037
01:29:16.770 --> 01:29:18.480
<v Speaker 2>Can't do that dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a trap.</v>

2038
01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:21.540
<v Speaker 2>You trap you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We thought he heard them.</v>

2039
01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:24.840
<v Speaker 2>You know he didn't really hurt him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Damien maia did exactly.</v>

2040
01:29:24.870 --> 01:29:27.360
<v Speaker 2>Britain shop just returns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did exactly what we were saying about</v>

2041
01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:30.390
<v Speaker 2>for breach over dealing with fader.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He pretends he gets hurt and matt brown</v>

2042
01:29:30.391 --> 01:29:35.220
<v Speaker 2>moved in to try to finish them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then maya got ahold of him in my</v>

2043
01:29:35.260 --> 01:29:37.410
<v Speaker 2>drag them to the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is how confident he is in his</v>

2044
01:29:37.411 --> 01:29:38.910
<v Speaker 2>jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He lets him mount him.</v>

2045
01:29:39.700 --> 01:29:41.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean he drags him to the ground just</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do this,</v>

2046
01:29:41.791 --> 01:29:42.570
<v Speaker 2>just to sweep them.</v>

2047
01:29:42.570 --> 01:29:45.570
<v Speaker 2>And now matt brown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sequence,</v>

2048
01:29:45.571 --> 01:29:49.080
<v Speaker 2>that whole sequence was so advanced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What he just did theRe,</v>

2049
01:29:49.290 --> 01:29:52.350
<v Speaker 2>he let matt brown drag him down in matt</v>
<v Speaker 2>brown.</v>

2050
01:29:52.500 --> 01:29:55.620
<v Speaker 2>His instincts is a destroyer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were to immeDiately get on top of him</v>

2051
01:29:55.650 --> 01:29:57.870
<v Speaker 2>because he's not seen that in training.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one's done training.</v>

2052
01:29:57.900 --> 01:30:00.060
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially not allowing him to</v>

2053
01:30:00.540 --> 01:30:02.790
<v Speaker 2>potentially knock them out with some</v>
<v Speaker 2>ground and pound,</v>

2054
01:30:03.150 --> 01:30:07.860
<v Speaker 2>but damien maia is jujitsu is so solid</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so slick that whatever shot</v>

2055
01:30:07.861 --> 01:30:10.110
<v Speaker 2>attempts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he gets off mostly a deflected and then</v>

2056
01:30:10.160 --> 01:30:13.380
<v Speaker 2>eventually sweeps him and now he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>mounting up against the cage and matt</v>

2057
01:30:13.381 --> 01:30:17.340
<v Speaker 2>brown right now is in quicksand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you have damien maia on top of you</v>

2058
01:30:17.341 --> 01:30:19.290
<v Speaker 2>and your legs are pinned together like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2059
01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:23.460
<v Speaker 2>That's a terrifying because what he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>done here is he's isolated his legs with</v>

2060
01:30:23.461 --> 01:30:26.130
<v Speaker 2>a triangle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So by having those legs extended like</v>

2061
01:30:26.131 --> 01:30:28.050
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has no power from his hips.</v>

2062
01:30:28.110 --> 01:30:30.720
<v Speaker 2>He can't throw any punches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he can't get his feet back under them</v>

2063
01:30:30.721 --> 01:30:33.930
<v Speaker 2>and can't get those legs back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's got to commit with his hands.</v>

2064
01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:36.720
<v Speaker 2>So he's got to push down with his hands</v>
<v Speaker 2>and while he's pushing down his hands,</v>

2065
01:30:36.721 --> 01:30:40.500
<v Speaker 2>mike and punch him in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so finally he gets his half guard</v>

2066
01:30:40.501 --> 01:30:41.880
<v Speaker 2>back up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But whatever.</v>

2067
01:30:41.881 --> 01:30:45.150
<v Speaker 2>Good luck with that butterfly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'll get these butterflies,</v>

2068
01:30:45.151 --> 01:30:47.220
<v Speaker 2>a mild.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll just sit on your legs and wear</v>

2069
01:30:47.221 --> 01:30:49.290
<v Speaker 2>them out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put pressure on you,</v>

2070
01:30:49.470 --> 01:30:51.800
<v Speaker 2>and then when you stand up and just get</v>
<v Speaker 2>to an even better position.</v>

2071
01:30:51.810 --> 01:30:53.300
<v Speaker 2>This for all three rounds by the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2072
01:30:53.310 --> 01:30:54.480
<v Speaker 2>this is what he does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2073
01:30:54.481 --> 01:30:58.410
<v Speaker 2>He did it to rick story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rick story is a real law.</v>

2074
01:30:58.530 --> 01:31:03.530
<v Speaker 2>He's a gorilla wrestler who walks around</v>
<v Speaker 2>a 200 cuts down to one 70 and demian</v>

2075
01:31:04.141 --> 01:31:06.060
<v Speaker 2>maia ragdoll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That wasn't that precedent.</v>

2076
01:31:06.090 --> 01:31:09.640
<v Speaker 2>He did it to gunner nelson and then neil</v>
<v Speaker 2>magnums like,</v>

2077
01:31:09.641 --> 01:31:10.381
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're on a winning streak.</v>

2078
01:31:10.381 --> 01:31:11.520
<v Speaker 2>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Check this out.</v>

2079
01:31:14.580 --> 01:31:18.600
<v Speaker 2>Jake shields beat damien maia grappling</v>
<v Speaker 2>contest will create eight.</v>

2080
01:31:18.601 --> 01:31:21.870
<v Speaker 2>Shields is legit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the best in the world and as a</v>

2081
01:31:21.871 --> 01:31:23.550
<v Speaker 2>grappler,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the best in the world.</v>

2082
01:31:23.580 --> 01:31:25.370
<v Speaker 2>I beat him in the ufc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2083
01:31:25.680 --> 01:31:27.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's my grappling.</v>

2084
01:31:27.481 --> 01:31:29.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because if they were grappling,</v>

2085
01:31:29.161 --> 01:31:30.690
<v Speaker 2>jake would give him a hell of a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>run.</v>

2086
01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:34.720
<v Speaker 2>Jake is a base dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His grappling is absolutely world class.</v>

2087
01:31:34.740 --> 01:31:36.180
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His problem in the ufc,</v>

2088
01:31:36.181 --> 01:31:37.950
<v Speaker 2>he's always been a speed and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>striking.</v>

2089
01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:41.060
<v Speaker 2>He's just not a dangerous striker in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way a lot of guys are.</v>

2090
01:31:41.100 --> 01:31:43.800
<v Speaker 2>It's not even that he's a born fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2091
01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:45.960
<v Speaker 2>not to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the breast.</v>

2092
01:31:45.961 --> 01:31:48.280
<v Speaker 2>So you look at you look at who he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>been.</v>

2093
01:31:48.290 --> 01:31:51.720
<v Speaker 2>This he's beat the very best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's beat I think top five guys.</v>

2094
01:31:51.930 --> 01:31:54.960
<v Speaker 2>He's beat robbie lawler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at all these guys.</v>

2095
01:31:54.990 --> 01:31:56.750
<v Speaker 2>Damien maia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2096
01:31:56.790 --> 01:31:57.623
<v Speaker 2>you had this.</v>

2097
01:31:57.640 --> 01:31:59.410
<v Speaker 2>He's trying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's trying to protect himself,</v>

2098
01:31:59.411 --> 01:32:02.380
<v Speaker 2>but it's just few tile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just when maya gets that body</v>

2099
01:32:02.381 --> 01:32:05.440
<v Speaker 2>triangle round on you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just constantly manipulating you.</v>

2100
01:32:05.441 --> 01:32:10.441
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't try and one direction only</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he is setting up escape doors.</v>

2101
01:32:10.780 --> 01:32:12.940
<v Speaker 2>So if you try to move through one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>those escape doors,</v>

2102
01:32:12.941 --> 01:32:16.450
<v Speaker 2>a new trap is waiting for you and those</v>
<v Speaker 2>traps you're not going to see because</v>

2103
01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:18.610
<v Speaker 2>from years and years and years of</v>
<v Speaker 2>jujitsu,</v>

2104
01:32:18.640 --> 01:32:21.130
<v Speaker 2>so your basic movements that usually get</v>
<v Speaker 2>you out.</v>

2105
01:32:21.320 --> 01:32:23.890
<v Speaker 2>It happen right in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Over and over.</v>

2106
01:32:23.940 --> 01:32:24.773
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't say,</v>

2107
01:32:25.110 --> 01:32:26.260
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well let me ask you this.</v>

2108
01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:27.670
<v Speaker 2>You would know this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

2109
01:32:27.671 --> 01:32:31.840
<v Speaker 2>WHen they showed the top contenders in</v>
<v Speaker 2>185 pound weight class was yoel romero</v>

2110
01:32:31.841 --> 01:32:34.230
<v Speaker 2>not there because he's just got clear</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he just got.</v>

2111
01:32:34.240 --> 01:32:35.680
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he didn't get cleared to fight again.</v>

2112
01:32:36.010 --> 01:32:38.410
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they cleared the possibility that he</v>

2113
01:32:38.411 --> 01:32:42.190
<v Speaker 2>might get a lesser sentence because they</v>
<v Speaker 2>found that supplement that he took,</v>

2114
01:32:42.191 --> 01:32:45.790
<v Speaker 2>but you're not supposed to take</v>
<v Speaker 2>supplements when you just buy some shit</v>

2115
01:32:45.791 --> 01:32:46.330
<v Speaker 2>at gnc.</v>

2116
01:32:46.330 --> 01:32:48.880
<v Speaker 2>He's just beat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mine has just beaten on them and</v>

2117
01:32:48.910 --> 01:32:51.340
<v Speaker 2>manipulating them with that body</v>
<v Speaker 2>triangle man.</v>

2118
01:32:51.400 --> 01:32:53.830
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because there is not clear.</v>

2119
01:32:53.850 --> 01:32:54.840
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was clear to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2120
01:32:55.600 --> 01:32:57.130
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they've made a clear</v>

2121
01:32:57.131 --> 01:32:59.690
<v Speaker 2>decision yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they've opened the door for him with</v>

2122
01:32:59.720 --> 01:33:00.521
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my god.</v>

2123
01:33:00.521 --> 01:33:02.440
<v Speaker 2>He tried to punch back behind him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>

2124
01:33:02.940 --> 01:33:04.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm surprised you did that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2125
01:33:04.361 --> 01:33:06.480
<v Speaker 2>he's done exactly once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's under the neck.</v>

2126
01:33:06.680 --> 01:33:07.460
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this one.</v>

2127
01:33:07.460 --> 01:33:10.420

2155
01:34:10.181 --> 01:34:12.370
<v Speaker 2>It was too small.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't strong enough to overwhelm</v>

2156
01:34:12.371 --> 01:34:15.460
<v Speaker 2>them at one slash 70 but,</v>

01:34:29.470 --> 01:34:32.020

01:34:37.511 --> 01:34:40.330
<v Speaker 2>who knows what was going on and now</v>
<v Speaker 2>weidman says he had a broken foot,</v>

2167
01:34:40.331 --> 01:34:42.070
<v Speaker 2>but luke said he had a bad staph</v>
<v Speaker 2>infection.</v>

2168
01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:45.820
<v Speaker 2>You know more than anybody when you go</v>
<v Speaker 2>into fights most of the time you're not</v>

2169
01:34:45.821 --> 01:34:47.090
<v Speaker 2>100 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>100 percent.</v>

2170
01:34:47.091 --> 01:34:50.230
<v Speaker 2>And with with weidman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from what I hear from this campaign from</v>

2171
01:34:50.231 --> 01:34:52.660
<v Speaker 2>him is it was the worst camp of his</v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

2172
01:34:52.690 --> 01:34:56.500
<v Speaker 2>Like he knew he needed to change things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he thought he was so talented as</v>

2173
01:34:56.501 --> 01:34:57.160
<v Speaker 2>real champions.</v>

2174
01:34:57.160 --> 01:34:58.370
<v Speaker 2>Fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Didn't even do anything.</v>

2175
01:34:58.430 --> 01:35:02.150
<v Speaker 2>Why was it the worst camp?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess he had injuries and certain</v>

2176
01:35:02.151 --> 01:35:06.150
<v Speaker 2>things like he should have been flying</v>
<v Speaker 2>people in and he just didn't in a.</v>

2177
01:35:06.280 --> 01:35:07.760
<v Speaker 2>He should have been going somewhere</v>
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>

2178
01:35:07.820 --> 01:35:11.010
<v Speaker 2>Was working with Mark Henry Moore and</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing other stuff and he's just a good</v>

2179
01:35:11.011 --> 01:35:13.070
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2180
01:35:13.710 --> 01:35:17.110
<v Speaker 2>and it ended up costing them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is no,</v>

2181
01:35:17.730 --> 01:35:21.010
<v Speaker 2>this is no gimme fight for either god or</v>
<v Speaker 2>either guy.</v>

2182
01:35:21.011 --> 01:35:22.880

<v Speaker 2>This is a war,</v>

<v Speaker 2>through them this time because he thinks</v>

<v Speaker 2>he doesn't have a staph infection and</v>

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:37.890
<v Speaker 2>Whereas back and forth from here that</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the third round fight of the</v>

2280
01:39:37.891 --> 01:39:39.630
<v Speaker 2>night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it was.</v>

2281
01:39:39.631 --> 01:39:41.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was the diego brandao fight.</v>

2282
01:39:41.761 --> 01:39:43.530
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And randall said,</v>

2283
01:39:43.531 --> 01:39:45.540
<v Speaker 2>you know what man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go to strip clubs with a</v>

2284
01:39:45.541 --> 01:39:47.190
<v Speaker 2>gun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see how this works out?</v>

2285
01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:48.720
<v Speaker 2>Then use said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

2286
01:39:48.930 --> 01:39:50.780
<v Speaker 2>you're not John Jones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to fletcher.</v>

2287
01:39:50.790 --> 01:39:55.670
<v Speaker 2>go bless you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go to a strip club with a gun idea.</v>

2288
01:39:56.460 --> 01:40:00.270
<v Speaker 2>Bad idea or impulse control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm remembering the fight.</v>

2289
01:40:00.300 --> 01:40:01.950
<v Speaker 2>It was super,</v>
<v Speaker 2>super impressive.</v>

2290
01:40:02.260 --> 01:40:04.650
<v Speaker 2>That plagues weedo or tayga one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fun.</v>

2291
01:40:04.830 --> 01:40:07.380
<v Speaker 2>When they told me you got that match up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said this the perfect fight for you</v>

2292
01:40:07.390 --> 01:40:10.200
<v Speaker 2>because the big name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a great style match up for you and</v>

2293
01:40:10.201 --> 01:40:12.000
<v Speaker 2>everyone loves clay and it puts you more</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the map.</v>

2294
01:40:12.160 --> 01:40:14.280
<v Speaker 2>You know clay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's he?</v>

2295
01:40:14.310 --> 01:40:15.580
<v Speaker 2>Where's he at now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is he's still trying to.</v>

2296
01:40:15.581 --> 01:40:19.460
<v Speaker 2>jackson's or jackson muscle farm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like in his rv and shit.</v>

2297
01:40:19.470 --> 01:40:21.870
<v Speaker 2>Driving around nonstop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been awhile since he said a good.</v>

2298
01:40:21.871 --> 01:40:24.120
<v Speaker 2>When I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You gotta wonder how much longer he's</v>

2299
01:40:24.121 --> 01:40:25.830
<v Speaker 2>going to be doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agreement.</v>

2300
01:40:25.860 --> 01:40:27.900
<v Speaker 2>So this could be a make or break fight</v>
<v Speaker 2>for him,</v>

2301
01:40:27.901 --> 01:40:29.250
<v Speaker 2>but if he wins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows?</v>

2302
01:40:29.480 --> 01:40:33.450
<v Speaker 2>Resurgence after cruz favor with three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2303
01:40:33.540 --> 01:40:35.670
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just not excited for it.</v>

2304
01:40:35.790 --> 01:40:36.660
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2305
01:40:36.661 --> 01:40:38.550
<v Speaker 2>Why are you out of your mind knowing</v>
<v Speaker 2>that weird.</v>

2306
01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:41.400
<v Speaker 2>Oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you cite for maybe I'd love this</v>

2307
01:40:41.401 --> 01:40:43.410
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love this fight because first of all,</v>

2308
01:40:43.800 --> 01:40:48.540
<v Speaker 2>I think uriah faber is as close as you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can get to being a world champion.</v>

2309
01:40:48.870 --> 01:40:51.840
<v Speaker 2>Goddamn me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's on the edge.</v>

2310
01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:53.650
<v Speaker 2>Like everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He fights.</v>

2311
01:40:54.250 --> 01:40:57.160
<v Speaker 2>Like if he loses to like a world</v>
<v Speaker 2>champion,</v>

2312
01:40:57.161 --> 01:41:02.161
<v Speaker 2>it's like a whisper thin decision close</v>
<v Speaker 2>or the one fight that he had with hanan</v>

2313
01:41:02.561 --> 01:41:06.790
<v Speaker 2>barao he got cracked and that was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>weird stoppage man as like he definitely</v>

2314
01:41:06.791 --> 01:41:09.460
<v Speaker 2>got cracked and if hanan barao cracks</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got fucking problems.</v>

2315
01:41:09.460 --> 01:41:11.170
<v Speaker 2>But I thought the stop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was a little weird,</v>

2316
01:41:11.950 --> 01:41:15.220
<v Speaker 2>but anybody can get cracked like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anybody can lose like that.</v>

2317
01:41:15.221 --> 01:41:18.040
<v Speaker 2>That's just a part of this game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think if you look at talent level</v>

2318
01:41:18.041 --> 01:41:20.230
<v Speaker 2>and skill level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go back to like the Michael Macdonald</v>

2319
01:41:20.231 --> 01:41:23.870
<v Speaker 2>fight when he fucking just blitzkrieg</v>
<v Speaker 2>dumb and smashed him.</v>

2320
01:41:24.090 --> 01:41:27.250
<v Speaker 2>Donaldson just came back recently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>came back recently and one looked</v>

2321
01:41:27.251 --> 01:41:28.460
<v Speaker 2>fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Looked good.</v>

2322
01:41:28.461 --> 01:41:30.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that fight was kinda like,</v>

2323
01:41:30.101 --> 01:41:31.040
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2324
01:41:31.150 --> 01:41:33.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to take a little break.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when uriah beat them,</v>

2325
01:41:33.700 --> 01:41:35.500
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it really cemented in my hand.</v>

2326
01:41:35.501 --> 01:41:36.290
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2327
01:41:36.290 --> 01:41:39.210
<v Speaker 2>you got to never sleep on this kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's never that.</v>

2328
01:41:39.220 --> 01:41:41.290
<v Speaker 2>You can't man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's one of the biggest draws to.</v>

2329
01:41:41.350 --> 01:41:44.590
<v Speaker 2>He's super competitive and I think he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>

2330
01:41:44.650 --> 01:41:47.770
<v Speaker 2>I think he keeps getting better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he's a guy that's in a</v>

2331
01:41:47.771 --> 01:41:48.670
<v Speaker 2>static state.</v>

2332
01:41:48.760 --> 01:41:50.380
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he's like a veteran that's</v>

2333
01:41:50.381 --> 01:41:51.131
<v Speaker 2>kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2334
01:41:51.131 --> 01:41:53.620
<v Speaker 2>just putting in the work and phoning it</v>
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>

2335
01:41:53.621 --> 01:41:55.180
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just gets in shape.</v>

2336
01:41:55.181 --> 01:41:56.100
<v Speaker 2>Brings us new.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Normal.</v>

2337
01:41:56.130 --> 01:41:58.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To always changing.</v>

2338
01:41:58.070 --> 01:42:00.010
<v Speaker 2>Always gas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he just keeps getting better</v>

2339
01:42:00.620 --> 01:42:02.470
<v Speaker 2>with this fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gun guns blazing.</v>

2340
01:42:02.500 --> 01:42:05.620
<v Speaker 2>You know what I want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I want the fucking winner of this</v>

2341
01:42:05.770 --> 01:42:07.930
<v Speaker 2>light's Mighty mouse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mighty mouse.</v>

2342
01:42:07.931 --> 01:42:09.070
<v Speaker 2>Beg for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2343
01:42:09.940 --> 01:42:11.040
<v Speaker 2>Beg for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

2344
01:42:11.120 --> 01:42:14.680
<v Speaker 2>California.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you imagine if your riaa faber beats</v>

2345
01:42:14.710 --> 01:42:17.980
<v Speaker 2>cruz anD that's a big f and then fight</v>
<v Speaker 2>mighty mouse.</v>

2346
01:42:19.030 --> 01:42:21.490
<v Speaker 2>Mighty mouse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you hate money and fame?</v>

2347
01:42:21.640 --> 01:42:23.440
<v Speaker 2>Let's do a dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uriah faber would,</v>

2348
01:42:23.500 --> 01:42:26.530
<v Speaker 2>for the first time in his career,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just dwarf somebody.</v>

2349
01:42:26.531 --> 01:42:27.970
<v Speaker 2>That bigger guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'd be like,</v>

2350
01:42:27.971 --> 01:42:32.230
<v Speaker 2>sideboard on shorter is mighty mouth</v>
<v Speaker 2>quite a bit,</v>

2351
01:42:32.231 --> 01:42:34.420
<v Speaker 2>but at pitt he's a small guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's just lice.</v>

2352
01:42:34.870 --> 01:42:37.830
<v Speaker 2>He makes up for tremendous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's impossible to hit and possible.</v>

2353
01:42:37.840 --> 01:42:41.280
<v Speaker 2>That's what he's heard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dominick cruz in my new method before.</v>

2354
01:42:41.760 --> 01:42:44.940
<v Speaker 2>How is that 1:35 and dominic wanted</v>
<v Speaker 2>decision.</v>

2355
01:42:45.060 --> 01:42:48.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but dominic is like got his own style.</v>

2356
01:42:48.580 --> 01:42:50.800
<v Speaker 2>If you look at his movement and his</v>
<v Speaker 2>patterns,</v>

2357
01:42:50.890 --> 01:42:53.950
<v Speaker 2>good luck finding anybody to replicate</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2358
01:42:54.250 --> 01:42:59.250
<v Speaker 2>His footwork and his movement and his</v>
<v Speaker 2>patterns are all designed to constantly</v>

2359
01:42:59.621 --> 01:43:03.340
<v Speaker 2>keep you guessing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're constantly like being overrun</v>

2360
01:43:03.370 --> 01:43:05.890
<v Speaker 2>with infoRmation of a guy stands in</v>
<v Speaker 2>front of you.</v>

2361
01:43:05.891 --> 01:43:08.590
<v Speaker 2>The less data that's coming your way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more that you have to.</v>

2362
01:43:08.620 --> 01:43:11.740
<v Speaker 2>You can concentrate on what's at hand</v>
<v Speaker 2>and focus on what you're trying to do.</v>

2363
01:43:11.790 --> 01:43:15.340
<v Speaker 2>Smartest guy in the sport I think and</v>
<v Speaker 2>dominic gives you that he doesn't give</v>

2364
01:43:15.341 --> 01:43:17.650
<v Speaker 2>you that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's never a time where he's standing</v>

2365
01:43:17.651 --> 01:43:18.940
<v Speaker 2>in front of you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just tying.</v>

2366
01:43:19.060 --> 01:43:23.020
<v Speaker 2>You</v>
<v Speaker 2>were talking to them and you were just</v>

2367
01:43:23.021 --> 01:43:25.400
<v Speaker 2>blown away or training with them and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>was training me in jail.</v>

2368
01:43:25.401 --> 01:43:27.580
<v Speaker 2>Like we're two white pills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like jesus christ.</v>

2369
01:43:27.581 --> 01:43:28.570
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a wizard.</v>

2370
01:43:28.840 --> 01:43:30.890
<v Speaker 2>He's a wizard dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're sleeping on poor.</v>

2371
01:43:30.900 --> 01:43:32.730
<v Speaker 2>You poor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know I'm not,</v>

2372
01:43:32.770 --> 01:43:34.500
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not sleeping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

2373
01:43:36.120 --> 01:43:39.440
<v Speaker 2>Bobby Green hasn't been in a big fight</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a while too.</v>

2374
01:43:39.600 --> 01:43:42.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm psyched to see him back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bobby greens want a lot of shit talking</v>

2375
01:43:42.800 --> 01:43:44.440
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He always does a lot of shit talking,</v>

2376
01:43:44.441 --> 01:43:47.530
<v Speaker 2>but Bobby Green when he's at his best,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is one of the best at 1:50.</v>

2377
01:43:47.531 --> 01:43:49.950
<v Speaker 2>So the diamond to man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it feels like five now.</v>

2378
01:43:50.020 --> 01:43:52.340
<v Speaker 2>They fell off just a tad</v>

2379
01:43:52.340 --> 01:43:54.290
<v Speaker 1>and then he's at 55 and connor knocked</v>
<v Speaker 1>him out.</v>

2380
01:43:55.040 --> 01:43:57.020
<v Speaker 1>He got knocked out in the first round by</v>
<v Speaker 1>connor and he just,</v>

2381
01:43:57.050 --> 01:43:59.810
<v Speaker 1>he started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He struggled too hard to make that</v>

2382
01:43:59.811 --> 01:44:00.644
<v Speaker 1>fucking wait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2383
01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:03.200
<v Speaker 1>And big dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those were doing the ivy days too,</v>

2384
01:44:03.320 --> 01:44:04.430
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

2385
01:44:05.450 --> 01:44:07.640
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting to see the</v>
<v Speaker 1>difference in a lot of these guys'</v>

2386
01:44:07.641 --> 01:44:10.580
<v Speaker 1>bodies now that there's so much testing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really is.</v>

2387
01:44:10.650 --> 01:44:13.970
<v Speaker 1>It's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of them,</v>

2388
01:44:14.480 --> 01:44:17.780
<v Speaker 1>some of them for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like what I would always think</v>

2389
01:44:17.781 --> 01:44:21.260
<v Speaker 1>is if you wrestled and you did jujitsu</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you boxed and you kicked you,</v>

2390
01:44:21.320 --> 01:44:23.480
<v Speaker 1>you'd come out looking very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very muscular.</v>

2391
01:44:23.930 --> 01:44:26.720
<v Speaker 1>When you look at guys back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2392
01:44:26.810 --> 01:44:29.060
<v Speaker 1>five years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you look at guys now,</v>

2393
01:44:29.330 --> 01:44:31.520
<v Speaker 1>there is a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if anything they look,</v>

2394
01:44:31.521 --> 01:44:35.720
<v Speaker 1>they get kind of skinnier or they've</v>
<v Speaker 1>realized that here's a big one.</v>

2395
01:44:35.750 --> 01:44:37.510
<v Speaker 1>Epo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can't use epo,</v>

2396
01:44:37.550 --> 01:44:39.810
<v Speaker 1>you gotta lose body mass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just have torres.</v>

2397
01:44:39.920 --> 01:44:40.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

2398
01:44:40.971 --> 01:44:45.350
<v Speaker 1>It's a big part of endurance oxygen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>melodion law,</v>

2399
01:44:45.570 --> 01:44:48.800
<v Speaker 1>whatever that stuff wasn't a boxer got</v>
<v Speaker 1>caught from is it mirrors that affects</v>

2400
01:44:48.890 --> 01:44:53.890
<v Speaker 1>russians are balls deep and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what the guy who fought on you</v>

2401
01:44:55.450 --> 01:44:58.220
<v Speaker 1>read.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You read about the sochi olympics,</v>

2402
01:44:58.390 --> 01:45:01.540
<v Speaker 1>but and how they've uncovered that there</v>
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>

2403
01:45:01.570 --> 01:45:05.990
<v Speaker 1>They don't know how they got into those</v>
<v Speaker 1>bottles that they make in Switzerland.</v>

2404
01:45:06.050 --> 01:45:09.170
<v Speaker 1>They're like tamper proof,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but however they did it,</v>

2405
01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:13.250
<v Speaker 1>they're drawing this whole thing where</v>
<v Speaker 1>every they think 100 athletes in the</v>

2406
01:45:13.251 --> 01:45:15.890
<v Speaker 1>olympics were cheating on the russian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the russian side,</v>

2407
01:45:16.370 --> 01:45:21.370
<v Speaker 1>and the information came from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>russian guy who ran the lab and the</v>

2408
01:45:21.441 --> 01:45:24.260
<v Speaker 1>other two guys that he worked with</v>
<v Speaker 1>mysteriously died.</v>

2409
01:45:24.530 --> 01:45:27.560
<v Speaker 1>So this guy exiled himself to los</v>
<v Speaker 1>angeles.</v>

2410
01:45:27.561 --> 01:45:30.530
<v Speaker 1>He ran the entire lab and now he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming clean and saying,</v>

2411
01:45:30.860 --> 01:45:35.120
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our intelligence operatives were were</v>

2412
01:45:35.121 --> 01:45:40.121
<v Speaker 1>basically involved in getting clean</v>
<v Speaker 1>samples to water,</v>

2413
01:45:40.530 --> 01:45:41.360
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

2414
01:45:41.360 --> 01:45:44.850
<v Speaker 1>Why is he snitching?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's basically out of us because</v>

2415
01:45:44.851 --> 01:45:48.950
<v Speaker 1>there's two colleagues work till killed</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they had.</v>

2416
01:45:48.951 --> 01:45:52.280
<v Speaker 1>They knew things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he went la and shut your mouth,</v>

2417
01:45:52.281 --> 01:45:54.340
<v Speaker 1>but he did know he was rushing to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>ya.</v>

2418
01:45:54.410 --> 01:45:57.470
<v Speaker 1>You can't shut your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can still get them.</v>

2419
01:45:57.530 --> 01:45:58.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he had to prove that he was.</v>

2420
01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:00.380
<v Speaker 1>He was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His life was in danger.</v>

2421
01:46:00.640 --> 01:46:02.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't think they'd get you if you</v>

2422
01:46:02.331 --> 01:46:03.830
<v Speaker 1>shut your mouth and you moved to la.</v>
<v Speaker 1>OH,</v>

2423

<v Speaker 1>you made it.</v>

2424
01:46:05.540 --> 01:46:07.570
<v Speaker 1>You touched base.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They killed that guy in dc and the</v>

2425
01:46:07.580 --> 01:46:10.850
<v Speaker 1>movies they killed by russian</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence can find you who they kill</v>

<v Speaker 1>This guy found he was bread with blunt</v>

2427
01:46:14.780 --> 01:46:16.820
<v Speaker 1>force trauma to the head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder how that happened.</v>

2428
01:46:16.821 --> 01:46:17.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but here's the thing,</v>

2429
01:46:17.691 --> 01:46:20.360
<v Speaker 1>the autopsy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they didn't do an autopsy for a</v>

2430
01:46:20.361 --> 01:46:24.260
<v Speaker 1>long time and initially the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cause of death was ruled as like a</v>

2431
01:46:24.261 --> 01:46:27.110
<v Speaker 1>heart attack and then they found a blunt</v>
<v Speaker 1>force trauma in his head.</v>

2432
01:46:27.140 --> 01:46:28.560
<v Speaker 1>How do you miss thAt?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2433
01:46:30.260 --> 01:46:33.860
<v Speaker 1>because it's a spooky story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>X eight to putin died a blunt force</v>

2434
01:46:33.861 --> 01:46:37.040

<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

2435
01:46:37.041 --> 01:46:40.310
<v Speaker 1>but like look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they found him and look when they.</v>

2436
01:46:40.400 --> 01:46:44.780
<v Speaker 1>They actually made the autopsy claim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was like quite a bit of time.</v>

2437
01:46:44.840 --> 01:46:49.740
<v Speaker 1>He actually died from blunt force trauma</v>
<v Speaker 1>kettlebell in the fucking head.</v>

2438
01:46:49.741 --> 01:46:49.980
<v Speaker 1>That's what</v>

2439
01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:53.950
<v Speaker 2>they did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some russian bugging kettle.</v>

2440
01:46:53.951 --> 01:46:57.210
<v Speaker 2>Then he tied him up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They tied him up and then you just did</v>

2441
01:46:57.211 --> 01:47:01.680
<v Speaker 2>fucking swings right at his head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you imagine somebody killed you with</v>

2442
01:47:01.681 --> 01:47:04.440
<v Speaker 2>a kettlebell?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just being tied up by some russian</v>

2443
01:47:04.470 --> 01:47:05.303
<v Speaker 2>thugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Aeon,</v>

2444
01:47:05.430 --> 01:47:07.410
<v Speaker 2>flux brother.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>

2445
01:47:07.440 --> 01:47:11.510
<v Speaker 2>It said family members told russian news</v>
<v Speaker 2>media and november that they thought</v>

2446
01:47:11.520 --> 01:47:16.520
<v Speaker 2>leslie had suffered a heart attack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's when they put that down in</v>

2447
01:47:16.651 --> 01:47:19.200
<v Speaker 2>november.</v>
<v Speaker 2>so when was this article where they</v>

2448
01:47:19.201 --> 01:47:21.690
<v Speaker 2>decided that this is really recently as</v>
<v Speaker 2>march?</v>

2449
01:47:22.070 --> 01:47:22.561
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

2450
01:47:22.561 --> 01:47:26.280
<v Speaker 2>so there's all those months that went by</v>
<v Speaker 2>before it was announced that he was</v>

2451
01:47:26.281 --> 01:47:31.230
<v Speaker 2>killed in a hotel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now been caught just blatantly cheating</v>

2452
01:47:31.650 --> 01:47:33.850
<v Speaker 2>on in the olympics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2453
01:47:33.851 --> 01:47:37.170
<v Speaker 2>but this is a guy that says this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that there's been.</v>

2454
01:47:37.260 --> 01:47:39.720
<v Speaker 2>I've read the article.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that there's been</v>

2455
01:47:39.721 --> 01:47:42.330
<v Speaker 2>definitive proof that everything he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying is true.</v>

2456
01:47:42.390 --> 01:47:47.120
<v Speaker 2>That he has an exaggerated times that</v>
<v Speaker 2>ran two articles on their front page of</v>

2457
01:47:47.150 --> 01:47:49.320
<v Speaker 2>the New York times is going to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've checked their sources.</v>

2458
01:47:49.370 --> 01:47:50.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not a matter of checking</v>

2459
01:47:50.791 --> 01:47:54.600
<v Speaker 2>sources like what is the physical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the physical evidence that you</v>

2460
01:47:54.601 --> 01:47:55.560
<v Speaker 2>have?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The physical,</v>

2461
01:47:56.220 --> 01:47:59.880
<v Speaker 2>they're there very well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could be a story there that the New York</v>

2462
01:47:59.881 --> 01:48:02.250
<v Speaker 2>times must run and I'm sure that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>checked their sources,</v>

2463
01:48:02.550 --> 01:48:05.220
<v Speaker 2>but is there anything that they can hold</v>
<v Speaker 2>up and say,</v>

2464
01:48:05.400 --> 01:48:09.930
<v Speaker 2>this needs to be examined because this</v>
<v Speaker 2>is proof positive that it'd be great if</v>

2465
01:48:09.931 --> 01:48:13.140
<v Speaker 2>they did see be on cnn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't think it's there yet,</v>

2466
01:48:13.470 --> 01:48:16.650
<v Speaker 2>but look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's 100 percent going on.</v>

2467
01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:19.140
<v Speaker 2>Is anyone surprised?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2468
01:48:19.200 --> 01:48:21.990
<v Speaker 2>of course not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll novitsky told me straight up that</v>

2469
01:48:21.991 --> 01:48:25.470
<v Speaker 2>they're figuring out a way to move</v>
<v Speaker 2>around these things and that while he's</v>

2470
01:48:25.471 --> 01:48:26.191
<v Speaker 2>doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

2471
01:48:26.191 --> 01:48:27.024
<v Speaker 2>I always know.</v>

2472
01:48:27.200 --> 01:48:30.640
<v Speaker 2>And novitsky is jeff novitsky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's the guy who caught lance armstrong</v>

2473
01:48:30.641 --> 01:48:33.330
<v Speaker 2>was guy works for the ufc now because</v>
<v Speaker 2>for people listening to.</v>

2474
01:48:33.380 --> 01:48:34.560
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The golden snitch.</v>

2475
01:48:34.590 --> 01:48:35.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

2476
01:48:35.190 --> 01:48:39.030
<v Speaker 2>he's the guy that catches guys doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything and you know,</v>

2477
01:48:39.150 --> 01:48:41.940
<v Speaker 2>they're on top of the latest and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>greatest and he,</v>

2478
01:48:42.110 --> 01:48:43.800
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the government's money and the</v>

2479
01:48:43.801 --> 01:48:46.020
<v Speaker 2>latest I know he doesn't want to admit</v>
<v Speaker 2>that our money,</v>

2480
01:48:46.050 --> 01:48:48.840
<v Speaker 2>he wants to pretend he wants to pretend</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it was way less than that.</v>

2481
01:48:48.841 --> 01:48:50.640
<v Speaker 2>He was giving me like a figure on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>show and that's how,</v>

2482
01:48:50.790 --> 01:48:54.240
<v Speaker 2>that's why lance armstrong came on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>show because what he's not counting is</v>

2483
01:48:54.241 --> 01:48:57.480
<v Speaker 2>like salaries and flights and all this</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff with their county is like the</v>

2484
01:48:57.481 --> 01:48:59.820
<v Speaker 2>amount of money they actually had to</v>
<v Speaker 2>spend like on voucher.</v>

2485
01:48:59.830 --> 01:49:01.500
<v Speaker 2>So that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the government.</v>

2486
01:49:01.530 --> 01:49:04.500
<v Speaker 2>So that's the federal government with</v>
<v Speaker 2>unlimited resources.</v>

2487
01:49:04.680 --> 01:49:08.700
<v Speaker 2>Spending $32,</v>
<v Speaker 2>million dollars on a cyclist who still</v>

2488
01:49:08.720 --> 01:49:10.530
<v Speaker 2>wanted anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

2489
01:49:10.650 --> 01:49:14.100
<v Speaker 2>god still going after they're going</v>
<v Speaker 2>after him now for $100,000,000 still</v>

2490
01:49:14.101 --> 01:49:17.900
<v Speaker 2>because he's defrauded the government of</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much they paid him because he,</v>

2491
01:49:18.460 --> 01:49:21.290
<v Speaker 2>he raced for the post office,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keeps the ship.</v>

2492
01:49:21.310 --> 01:49:23.160
<v Speaker 2>You raise your tax dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But here's the thing,</v>

2493
01:49:23.161 --> 01:49:25.590
<v Speaker 2>if you race for the post office,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the post office is the government.</v>

2494
01:49:25.591 --> 01:49:28.200
<v Speaker 2>So they charge you for three times what</v>
<v Speaker 2>you took.</v>

2495
01:49:28.370 --> 01:49:31.320
<v Speaker 2>So if you took 33,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're charging them for a million</v>

2496
01:49:31.770 --> 01:49:32.800
<v Speaker 2>calls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It tyranny.</v>

2497
01:49:32.840 --> 01:49:34.120
<v Speaker 2>Riding a bike.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2498
01:49:34.210 --> 01:49:36.480
<v Speaker 2>Thirty three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They go after him for 100 letters,</v>

2499
01:49:36.540 --> 01:49:38.040
<v Speaker 2>write a letter to the government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see what happens.</v>

2500
01:49:38.060 --> 01:49:42.240
<v Speaker 2>He's the ultimate golden snitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why you say golden snitch was the golden</v>

2501
01:49:42.241 --> 01:49:45.030
<v Speaker 2>because he's at another level just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he's not a snItch.</v>

2502
01:49:45.060 --> 01:49:48.340
<v Speaker 2>He's an investigator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not to involve a snitch.</v>

2503
01:49:48.340 --> 01:49:50.840
<v Speaker 1>Will be victor conte.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Victor conte is a snitch.</v>

2504
01:49:50.940 --> 01:49:54.280
<v Speaker 1>He got to content on top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he didn't even rat on people.</v>

2505
01:49:54.281 --> 01:49:55.990
<v Speaker 1>When he got caught you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can't even call him a snitch.</v>

2506
01:49:56.230 --> 01:50:01.120
<v Speaker 1>You call them a post operative because</v>
<v Speaker 1>he lived on rats where I come from,</v>

2507
01:50:01.150 --> 01:50:01.990
<v Speaker 1>but he's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

2508
01:50:01.991 --> 01:50:04.450
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He used to be involved in it.</v>

2509
01:50:04.451 --> 01:50:06.820
<v Speaker 1>He's not involved in anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now he's going after people who are</v>

2510
01:50:06.821 --> 01:50:08.680
<v Speaker 1>involved with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what is that?</v>

2511
01:50:09.510 --> 01:50:12.050
<v Speaker 1>That's like an informer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But can I ask you a question?</v>

2512
01:50:12.100 --> 01:50:14.230
<v Speaker 1>Did they ever actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie says,</v>

2513
01:50:14.231 --> 01:50:16.030
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe did to kind of be a snitch because</v>

2514
01:50:16.031 --> 01:50:18.280
<v Speaker 1>he's really revealing all this</v>
<v Speaker 1>backstory,</v>

2515
01:50:18.520 --> 01:50:23.170
<v Speaker 1>but he could be reforMed and since</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're primarily concentrates on combat</v>

2516
01:50:23.171 --> 01:50:25.510
<v Speaker 1>sports athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could see him as a.</v>

2517
01:50:26.110 --> 01:50:30.940
<v Speaker 1>He's helping people like he'S keeping</v>
<v Speaker 1>people from cheating content or content.</v>

2518
01:50:31.900 --> 01:50:32.860
<v Speaker 1>Could you see it that way?</v>

2519
01:50:33.220 --> 01:50:34.870
<v Speaker 1>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he benefited.</v>

2520
01:50:35.080 --> 01:50:39.280
<v Speaker 1>The reason why he has a name reasonably</v>
<v Speaker 1>get so big is because he was helping so</v>

2521
01:50:39.281 --> 01:50:42.100
<v Speaker 1>many big name athletes and then now he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>against it,</v>

2522
01:50:42.250 --> 01:50:45.010
<v Speaker 1>but should that can be affected?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's helping all those big name</v>

2523
01:50:45.011 --> 01:50:48.070
<v Speaker 1>athletes could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should that disclude him from being able</v>

2524
01:50:48.071 --> 01:50:51.850
<v Speaker 1>to realize the error of his ways and</v>
<v Speaker 1>make an attempt to try to clean up the</v>

2525
01:50:51.851 --> 01:50:53.110
<v Speaker 1>sport?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that possible?</v>

2526
01:50:53.380 --> 01:50:54.550
<v Speaker 1>It's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's possible.</v>

2527
01:50:54.551 --> 01:50:56.930
<v Speaker 1>Right and possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how I hope to look at it.</v>

2528
01:50:56.931 --> 01:51:01.931
<v Speaker 1>If they ever find physical evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>physical evidence test that that showed</v>

2529
01:51:02.651 --> 01:51:05.930
<v Speaker 1>that lance armstrong actually cheated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has never commented,</v>

2530
01:51:06.190 --> 01:51:08.590
<v Speaker 1>so 500 tests or whatever it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it was,</v>

2531
01:51:08.620 --> 01:51:10.090
<v Speaker 1>he never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He passed all of them.</v>

2532
01:51:10.330 --> 01:51:12.100
<v Speaker 1>Thirty $2,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million dollars later,</v>

2533
01:51:12.101 --> 01:51:15.700
<v Speaker 1>but finally he admits that he used</v>
<v Speaker 1>performance enhancing drugs to oprah.</v>

2534
01:51:16.290 --> 01:51:19.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's very interesting to me.</v>

2535
01:51:19.720 --> 01:51:23.110
<v Speaker 1>What do you think the beneFit of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

2536
01:51:23.111 --> 01:51:26.230
<v Speaker 1>and I do think that there's a benefit to</v>
<v Speaker 1>going after people who are cheating,</v>

2537
01:51:26.380 --> 01:51:28.420
<v Speaker 1>who are trying to change the playing</v>
<v Speaker 1>field.</v>

2538
01:51:28.420 --> 01:51:31.030
<v Speaker 1>I know everybody does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know everybody does,</v>

2539
01:51:31.360 --> 01:51:32.860
<v Speaker 1>but it's an.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a.</v>

2540
01:51:32.870 --> 01:51:34.720
<v Speaker 1>It's a difficult thing because.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2541
01:51:34.721 --> 01:51:36.280
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not an american game.</v>

2542
01:51:36.760 --> 01:51:38.700
<v Speaker 1>You're in another country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're,</v>

2543
01:51:38.701 --> 01:51:41.940
<v Speaker 1>you're giving someone some sort of a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

2544
01:51:41.941 --> 01:51:45.100
<v Speaker 1>you're investigating them being involved</v>
<v Speaker 1>in something that's not even taking</v>

2545
01:51:45.101 --> 01:51:48.700
<v Speaker 1>place on american soil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the dubious right there.</v>

2546
01:51:49.030 --> 01:51:51.730
<v Speaker 1>Second of all you are saying as the post</v>
<v Speaker 1>office,</v>

2547
01:51:51.731 --> 01:51:54.340
<v Speaker 1>you're suing this guy for all the money</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he made while he was cheating and</v>

2548
01:51:54.341 --> 01:51:57.310
<v Speaker 1>using drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't know that cyclists are</v>

2549
01:51:57.311 --> 01:51:59.050
<v Speaker 1>cheating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you doing in the</v>

2550
01:51:59.051 --> 01:52:02.440
<v Speaker 1>cyclist business?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I know I'm a comedian living in</v>

2551
01:52:02.441 --> 01:52:04.310
<v Speaker 1>la and I know they're all cheating</v>
<v Speaker 1>exact,</v>

2552
01:52:04.311 --> 01:52:09.311
<v Speaker 1>so I know how much did he do for the us</v>
<v Speaker 1>postal office and also a lot of cycling.</v>

2553
01:52:10.610 --> 01:52:12.580
<v Speaker 1>Cycling to lance I'm sure started</v>
<v Speaker 1>kicking ass.</v>

2554
01:52:12.580 --> 01:52:14.320
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how much money did you raise for all</v>

2555
01:52:14.321 --> 01:52:15.550
<v Speaker 1>this cancer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a lot.</v>

2556
01:52:15.580 --> 01:52:17.640
<v Speaker 1>How Many people were running those</v>
<v Speaker 1>yellow wristband?</v>

2557
01:52:17.800 --> 01:52:20.220
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't disclose the,</v>

2558
01:52:20.230 --> 01:52:22.150
<v Speaker 1>here's the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is where he fucked up.</v>

2559
01:52:22.210 --> 01:52:25.480
<v Speaker 1>He Sued a bunch of people that were</v>
<v Speaker 1>telling the truth and he uses money.</v>

2560
01:52:25.840 --> 01:52:26.990
<v Speaker 1>That's where he fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

2561
01:52:27.140 --> 01:52:28.700
<v Speaker 1>that's where he's a bad guy at that</v>
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

2562
01:52:28.930 --> 01:52:31.720
<v Speaker 1>But also in his spoil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to go down to 15th place.</v>

2563
01:52:31.721 --> 01:52:33.760
<v Speaker 1>They were all doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The level playing field.</v>

2564
01:52:33.790 --> 01:52:37.570
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was about everybody was ratting on</v>

2565
01:52:37.571 --> 01:52:38.750
<v Speaker 1>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were,</v>

2566
01:52:38.800 --> 01:52:40.930
<v Speaker 1>they got caught.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were giving people up,</v>

2567
01:52:41.050 --> 01:52:44.080
<v Speaker 1>there was a lot of that going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And lance armstrong starts suing people</v>

2568
01:52:44.081 --> 01:52:44.950
<v Speaker 1>when they given up him.</v>

2569
01:52:45.980 --> 01:52:48.140
<v Speaker 3>That is where people have an issue with</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2570
01:52:48.470 --> 01:52:51.180
<v Speaker 3>And when his mind was touching himself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2571
01:52:52.160 --> 01:52:53.570
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can see both sides,</v>

2572
01:52:53.571 --> 01:52:54.740
<v Speaker 3>but I'm with lance armstrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2573
01:52:54.741 --> 01:52:56.180
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a snitch on me.</v>

2574
01:52:56.181 --> 01:52:58.190
<v Speaker 3>I gotta protect myself too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

2575
01:52:58.250 --> 01:53:01.430
<v Speaker 3>I started at first snitching on me and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the stitching.</v>

2576
01:53:01.790 --> 01:53:03.410
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we're boys,</v>

2577
01:53:03.500 --> 01:53:06.400
<v Speaker 3>the snitching is worse than the lawsuit</v>
<v Speaker 3>by far.</v>

2578
01:53:06.530 --> 01:53:08.030
<v Speaker 3>Especially was a team.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

2579
01:53:08.031 --> 01:53:10.550
<v Speaker 3>we represent America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but some of those guys weren't his boys</v>

2580
01:53:10.551 --> 01:53:11.900
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't like them anymore.</v>

2581
01:53:11.901 --> 01:53:13.550
<v Speaker 3>So why snitch?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very few people like.</v>

2582
01:53:13.930 --> 01:53:15.290
<v Speaker 3>Did you get anything out of it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You.</v>

<v Speaker 3>the word,</v>

2584

<v Speaker 3>but I'm not a liar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

2617
01:54:23.240 --> 01:54:24.670
<v Speaker 3>You definitely didn't say you're a</v>
<v Speaker 3>purple belt.</v>

2618
01:54:24.710 --> 01:54:26.150
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never said it was a purple</v>

2619
01:54:26.250 --> 01:54:27.350
<v Speaker 3>accidentally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once.</v>

2620
01:54:27.351 --> 01:54:28.750
<v Speaker 3>A little bit drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never even said it.</v>

2621
01:54:28.780 --> 01:54:31.090
<v Speaker 3>Tapped a purple truck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>ProbablY did once.</v>

2622
01:54:32.840 --> 01:54:35.500
<v Speaker 3>Saying b is the reason why he's lance</v>
<v Speaker 3>armstrong,</v>

2623
01:54:35.540 --> 01:54:37.580
<v Speaker 3>because these can be competitive at</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

2624
01:54:37.581 --> 01:54:39.790
<v Speaker 3>Anyone who's an ultra winter you just</v>
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

2625
01:54:39.791 --> 01:54:41.080
<v Speaker 3>I wish I was like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>

2626
01:54:41.970 --> 01:54:45.530
<v Speaker 3>why would you wish you would like you</v>
<v Speaker 3>are going to be a cyclist?</v>

2627
01:54:45.560 --> 01:54:46.371
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>

2628
01:54:46.371 --> 01:54:50.060
<v Speaker 3>What you want to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you are is a guy who always wants</v>

2629
01:54:50.061 --> 01:54:51.860
<v Speaker 3>to be something other than you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>ExActly,</v>

2630
01:54:52.010 --> 01:54:54.290
<v Speaker 3>and that's paRt of the fun being around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brian.</v>

2631
01:54:54.930 --> 01:54:58.580
<v Speaker 3>I wish it was that guy and then you'd go</v>
<v Speaker 3>into this romanticized version with that</v>

2632
01:54:58.581 --> 01:55:01.010
<v Speaker 3>guy is as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That guy lives liviNg in austin and</v>

2633
01:55:01.011 --> 01:55:02.330
<v Speaker 3>people throw an exit his house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2634
01:55:02.520 --> 01:55:07.400
<v Speaker 3>CAn't post sociAl media and I hate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's sort of relaxing a bit now,</v>

2635
01:55:07.401 --> 01:55:10.610
<v Speaker 3>but I mean look to when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the storm comes your way,</v>

2636
01:55:10.640 --> 01:55:13.520
<v Speaker 3>like when you get in trouble for</v>
<v Speaker 3>something along those lines,</v>

2637
01:55:13.521 --> 01:55:17.540
<v Speaker 3>the storm of being a national disgrace</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

2638
01:55:17.550 --> 01:55:21.170
<v Speaker 3>and someone who everyone's selling green</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's so much going on with the</v>

<v Speaker 3>lawsuits and the and he's still involved</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a lawsuit with the post office.</v>

2640
01:55:24.471 --> 01:55:29.090
<v Speaker 3>Like the storm of pressure and stress is</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably overwhelming and never end,</v>

2641
01:55:29.390 --> 01:55:33.980
<v Speaker 3>but also gives everyone now have voice</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2668
01:56:35.580 --> 01:56:39.720
<v Speaker 1>I think his parents had money because he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was going,</v>

2669
01:56:39.721 --> 01:56:42.120
<v Speaker 1>what I know from the internet is there</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

2670
01:56:42.690 --> 01:56:44.550
<v Speaker 1>I love what you do that with air quotes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>internet</v>

2671
01:56:46.920 --> 01:56:51.920
<v Speaker 1>underworld.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was playing that he has all this</v>

2672
01:56:52.111 --> 01:56:53.220
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this stuff from being one of these</v>

2673
01:56:53.221 --> 01:56:56.340
<v Speaker 1>top poker players in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But It came out that he comes from a lot</v>

2674
01:56:56.341 --> 01:56:59.410
<v Speaker 1>of money on this lifestyle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2675
01:56:59.670 --> 01:57:02.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lIke shooting guns with this color and</v>

2676
01:57:02.510 --> 01:57:04.650
<v Speaker 1>blah blah was drafting against the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rules.</v>

2677
01:57:04.800 --> 01:57:07.440
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't allowed to draft.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I did most of the trip I</v>

2678
01:57:07.441 --> 01:57:09.210
<v Speaker 1>think is behind a van like that.</v>

2679
01:57:09.480 --> 01:57:12.000
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where someone drove the van.</v>

2680
01:57:12.030 --> 01:57:14.080
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his beard is a major air drag.</v>

2681
01:57:14.250 --> 01:57:15.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2682
01:57:15.091 --> 01:57:17.580
<v Speaker 1>that's a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it wasn't within the</v>

2683
01:57:17.581 --> 01:57:19.110
<v Speaker 1>rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you should have set the rules</v>

2684
01:57:19.111 --> 01:57:21.810
<v Speaker 1>before they made that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if the wind is headed his</v>

2685
01:57:21.811 --> 01:57:24.780
<v Speaker 1>face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the wind that y'all got hustled,</v>

2686
01:57:24.920 --> 01:57:26.820
<v Speaker 1>the whim is headed towards his face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know what,</v>

2687
01:57:26.821 --> 01:57:29.670
<v Speaker 1>if they didn't put that in the rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they fucked up because bilzerian is a</v>

2688
01:57:29.671 --> 01:57:32.460
<v Speaker 1>smart bitch and look what he's got to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The vans back.</v>

2689
01:57:32.461 --> 01:57:35.160
<v Speaker 1>Doors are open so they could have a fan</v>
<v Speaker 1>blowing on him.</v>

2690
01:57:35.161 --> 01:57:37.440
<v Speaker 1>But like mr and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a pimp.</v>

2691
01:57:37.980 --> 01:57:41.010
<v Speaker 1>How do you not love that guy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every picture he takes got 100 whores</v>

2692
01:57:41.011 --> 01:57:43.560
<v Speaker 1>with him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does say I say that with all love,</v>

2693
01:57:43.620 --> 01:57:48.620
<v Speaker 1>all love and respect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Humans private jets and say he has 100</v>

2694
01:57:48.811 --> 01:57:50.550
<v Speaker 1>beautiful women with them because that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he does,</v>

2695
01:57:50.610 --> 01:57:53.150
<v Speaker 1>but that's kind of his persona.</v>

2696
01:57:53.400 --> 01:57:54.840
<v Speaker 1>Charlie's angels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of work.</v>

2697
01:57:54.841 --> 01:57:55.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2698
01:57:56.080 --> 01:57:58.980
<v Speaker 1>actually it is worth kind of like</v>
<v Speaker 1>dilating out a little bit.</v>

2699
01:57:58.981 --> 01:58:00.150
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2700
01:58:00.360 --> 01:58:04.740
<v Speaker 1>it's just not thAt inspiring to me and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I</v>

2701
01:58:06.850 --> 01:58:09.640
<v Speaker 1>can tell you right up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can tell you right now what brian's</v>

2702
01:58:09.660 --> 01:58:11.970
<v Speaker 1>trying to do is say that he's not a fan</v>
<v Speaker 1>of this guy.</v>

2703
01:58:11.980 --> 01:58:15.810
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to be very pc because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>never fucking draw the line with</v>

2704
01:58:15.890 --> 01:58:18.870
<v Speaker 1>anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't like this culture that is</v>

2705
01:58:18.990 --> 01:58:22.050
<v Speaker 1>essentially celebrating itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't.</v>

2706
01:58:22.320 --> 01:58:25.260
<v Speaker 1>That's not a guy to hang out with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're that happy with yourself and</v>

2707
01:58:25.261 --> 01:58:25.911
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2708
01:58:25.911 --> 01:58:26.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to spend met him.</v>

2709
01:58:27.120 --> 01:58:30.030
<v Speaker 1>Guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my business manager saying spending 125</v>

2710
01:58:30.031 --> 01:58:34.110
<v Speaker 1>k on a private jet was a bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I disagree with this naked girl.</v>

2711
01:58:34.320 --> 01:58:36.150
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure I'd love hanging out with them,</v>

2712
01:58:36.151 --> 01:58:39.720
<v Speaker 1>but it's just not that inspiring to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to realize that people</v>

2713
01:58:39.721 --> 01:58:42.730
<v Speaker 1>doing this or akin in a lot of ways too.</v>

2714
01:58:42.760 --> 01:58:46.180
<v Speaker 1>Gangsta rappers like what they're doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>is putting out an image.</v>

2715
01:58:46.181 --> 01:58:51.181
<v Speaker 1>That image becomes popular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That popular image equates to millions</v>

2716
01:58:52.240 --> 01:58:53.880
<v Speaker 1>and millions of followers on instagram</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he's manipulated the media.</v>

2717
01:58:53.881 --> 01:58:56.830
<v Speaker 1>Yes to all and he can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he can use that to promote himself</v>

2718
01:58:56.831 --> 01:59:00.370
<v Speaker 1>and all sorts of different ways and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>he becomes a business mode himself.</v>

2719
01:59:00.400 --> 01:59:02.410
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you do when you're promoting</v>

2720
01:59:02.411 --> 01:59:04.690
<v Speaker 1>shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm saying is like a person promotes</v>

2721
01:59:04.691 --> 01:59:07.060
<v Speaker 1>himself on instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's a girl's got yoga pants and a</v>

2722
01:59:07.061 --> 01:59:09.700
<v Speaker 1>nice big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she makes money all of a sudden</v>

2723
01:59:09.730 --> 01:59:12.220
<v Speaker 1>doing squats and I'm at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a lot of those people,</v>

2724
01:59:12.221 --> 01:59:13.240
<v Speaker 1>but there's a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2725
01:59:13.241 --> 01:59:16.600
<v Speaker 1>look at that time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the difference between a girl</v>

2726
01:59:16.601 --> 01:59:19.000
<v Speaker 1>sticking her butt out or him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got $17.</v>

2727
01:59:19.001 --> 01:59:20.010
<v Speaker 1>Million is two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no difference.</v>

2728

<v Speaker 1>You're just saying it's not inspiring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2729
01:59:21.701 --> 01:59:25.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't you think it's a little bit maybe</v>

2730
01:59:25.151 --> 01:59:29.560
<v Speaker 1>like the difference between you see a</v>
<v Speaker 1>body that's built for something like if</v>

2731
01:59:29.561 --> 01:59:33.010
<v Speaker 1>you look at joe showings body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's built for a purpose and then you</v>

2732
01:59:33.011 --> 01:59:35.920
<v Speaker 1>see somebody who's a bodybuilder all due</v>
<v Speaker 1>respect to body parts is a hard thing to</v>

2733
01:59:35.921 --> 01:59:36.140
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

2734
01:59:36.140 --> 01:59:38.650
<v Speaker 1>Look on there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just that cool.</v>

2735
01:59:38.770 --> 01:59:41.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three is 343,000.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You're saying he doesn't have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't have skills,</v>

2737
01:59:43.930 --> 01:59:45.200
<v Speaker 1>you're saying he doesn't possess the</v>
<v Speaker 1>skill,</v>

2738
01:59:45.340 --> 01:59:47.590
<v Speaker 1>skill of self promotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it ends there.</v>

2739
01:59:47.610 --> 01:59:49.570
<v Speaker 1>so thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you say that,</v>

2740
01:59:49.571 --> 01:59:51.790
<v Speaker 1>but how do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because he's also a professional poker</v>

2741
01:59:51.791 --> 01:59:53.800
<v Speaker 1>player,</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes millions of dollars gambling.</v>

2742
01:59:54.150 --> 01:59:57.460
<v Speaker 1>So they say so is it debatable?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2743
01:59:57.490 --> 01:59:59.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't he win this fucking debate that</v>

2744
01:59:59.200 --> 02:00:01.240
<v Speaker 1>he won this million dollar bet to go to</v>
<v Speaker 1>vegas?</v>

2745
02:00:01.860 --> 02:00:03.820
<v Speaker 1>But he did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I meAn he worked hard.</v>

2746
02:00:03.821 --> 02:00:05.260
<v Speaker 1>He worked hard for five weeks to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2747
02:00:05.261 --> 02:00:07.720
<v Speaker 1>It's not like an empty guy with no</v>
<v Speaker 1>character.</v>

2748
02:00:07.721 --> 02:00:10.390
<v Speaker 1>It might be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what might be some</v>

2749
02:00:10.400 --> 02:00:12.340
<v Speaker 1>stiffness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He might be a wild,</v>

02:00:12.341 --> 02:00:16.360
<v Speaker 1>fun seeking motherfucker that's actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>pulling it off as a marketing genius.</v>

2751
02:00:16.420 --> 02:00:19.930
<v Speaker 1>If you were a guy I didn't have any set</v>
<v Speaker 1>of skills and all of a sudden by hook or</v>

2752
02:00:19.931 --> 02:00:23.950

<v Speaker 1>yourself with $100,000,000.</v>

<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

2764
02:00:50.440 --> 02:00:52.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm tRying to think of who.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever.</v>

02:00:52.570 --> 02:00:55.990
<v Speaker 1>Do you mean right before the show as too</v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

2770
02:01:01.210 --> 02:01:05.090

<v Speaker 1>because he has skills to be.</v>

2771
02:01:05.110 --> 02:01:06.580
<v Speaker 1>If you can be $100,000,000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

2772
02:01:06.790 --> 02:01:07.720
<v Speaker 1>you can be 100 million dollars.</v>

2773
02:01:07.720 --> 02:01:09.240
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm going to do the</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility.</v>

2774
02:01:09.260 --> 02:01:14.260
<v Speaker 1>Don't say I'm reading your mind to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>a difference in the world and you try</v>

2775
02:01:14.341 --> 02:01:15.174
<v Speaker 1>and do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

2776
02:01:15.250 --> 02:01:18.470
<v Speaker 1>I am at least,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least with the skills I have.</v>

2777
02:01:18.550 --> 02:01:19.061
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2778
02:01:19.061 --> 02:01:22.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to be as original as I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're not doing that because you</v>

2779
02:01:22.991 --> 02:01:24.580
<v Speaker 1>enjoy it because you're entertaining</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

2780
02:01:24.640 --> 02:01:25.330
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not.</v>

2781
02:01:25.330 --> 02:01:28.150
<v Speaker 1>You're not going out seeking to make a</v>
<v Speaker 1>difference in the world.</v>

2782
02:01:28.300 --> 02:01:31.210
<v Speaker 1>You're going out having a good time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making it,</v>

2783
02:01:31.560 --> 02:01:33.910
<v Speaker 1>doing a good packed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly right,</v>

2784
02:01:33.911 --> 02:01:37.930
<v Speaker 1>but I also do try to make a difference</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world in my own way charity wise</v>

2785
02:01:37.931 --> 02:01:39.290
<v Speaker 1>and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

2786
02:01:39.440 --> 02:01:42.950
<v Speaker 1>I spend money on charity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spend money to make the world.</v>

2787
02:01:43.170 --> 02:01:44.920
<v Speaker 1>If you give me a $100,000,000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had a guy,</v>

2788
02:01:44.970 --> 02:01:46.850
<v Speaker 1>but let's be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not a guy who's like really</v>

2789
02:01:46.851 --> 02:01:51.851
<v Speaker 1>promoting charities a lot and talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it a lot and giving money to go to</v>

2790
02:01:52.370 --> 02:01:52.850
<v Speaker 1>do is.</v>

2791
02:01:52.850 --> 02:01:56.030
<v Speaker 1>What I'm trying to do is go to friends</v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

2792
02:01:56.310 --> 02:01:58.030
<v Speaker 1>Let's just take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's take standup.</v>

2793
02:01:58.230 --> 02:02:02.630
<v Speaker 1>So stand up for me with stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least what I'm trying to do in my own</v>

2794
02:02:02.631 --> 02:02:05.060
<v Speaker 1>mind is surprised myself and come up</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

2795
02:02:05.170 --> 02:02:07.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see what I'm made of and trying to get</v>

2796
02:02:07.300 --> 02:02:10.040
<v Speaker 1>people doing your thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's your way of giving.</v>

2797
02:02:10.340 --> 02:02:13.390
<v Speaker 1>This is not a criticism of your standup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're hilarious.</v>

2798
02:02:13.410 --> 02:02:13.961
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love.</v>

2799
02:02:13.961 --> 02:02:15.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're saying is that what I'm</v>

2800
02:02:15.711 --> 02:02:19.040
<v Speaker 1>saying is that I think there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>difference between the skill of standup,</v>

2801
02:02:19.060 --> 02:02:21.260
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and come up with a body of work and</v>

2802
02:02:21.261 --> 02:02:25.640
<v Speaker 1>taken all that money and shooting guns</v>
<v Speaker 1>and being on a private jet and having</v>

2803
02:02:25.670 --> 02:02:26.990
<v Speaker 1>chicks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the problem.</v>

2804
02:02:26.991 --> 02:02:28.280
<v Speaker 1>We know he's not giving to charity</v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

2805
02:02:28.281 --> 02:02:30.320
<v Speaker 1>listen man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know that and here's the deal.</v>

2806
02:02:30.350 --> 02:02:31.010
<v Speaker 1>He might.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He might be.</v>

2807
02:02:31.010 --> 02:02:32.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might not be.</v>

2808
02:02:32.510 --> 02:02:34.490
<v Speaker 1>Who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I'm seeing is a show.</v>

2809
02:02:34.760 --> 02:02:38.150
<v Speaker 1>It's a very short snippet show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you just saw there when he's</v>

2810
02:02:38.151 --> 02:02:40.340
<v Speaker 1>walking by that girl's butt and he's got</v>
<v Speaker 1>a machine.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is criteria for how to live your</v>

2840
02:04:02.241 --> 02:04:03.074
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

2841
02:04:03.120 --> 02:04:04.580
<v Speaker 1>There's criteria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to live your life,</v>

2842
02:04:04.940 --> 02:04:08.480
<v Speaker 1>and I think if you spent $125,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million thousand dollars,</v>

2843
02:04:08.481 --> 02:04:11.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm whatever on looking great and</v>
<v Speaker 1>celebrating yourself.</v>

2844
02:04:11.870 --> 02:04:15.770
<v Speaker 1>I just think it kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just not really.</v>

2845
02:04:16.160 --> 02:04:17.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

2846
02:04:18.630 --> 02:04:21.560
<v Speaker 1>It's a brilliant marketing plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get that.</v>

2847
02:04:21.561 --> 02:04:24.920
<v Speaker 1>It might not be your thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have to be your thing.</v>

2848
02:04:24.970 --> 02:04:27.360
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly what I'd do with my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My point is like,</v>

2849
02:04:27.860 --> 02:04:32.270
<v Speaker 1>to me it's not offensive at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No more offensive than the kardashians.</v>

2850
02:04:32.271 --> 02:04:34.250
<v Speaker 1>The kardashians don't offend me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2851
02:04:34.251 --> 02:04:37.200
<v Speaker 1>I can make fun of it all day long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not offended by what they're</v>

2852
02:04:37.201 --> 02:04:38.670
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anything's wrong with it.</v>

2853
02:04:38.700 --> 02:04:41.850
<v Speaker 1>I do itself celebration and I find that</v>
<v Speaker 1>very.</v>

2854
02:04:42.010 --> 02:04:44.040
<v Speaker 1>I just all around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not my favorite thing,</v>

2855
02:04:44.400 --> 02:04:47.280
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't bother me saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this guy is funny.</v>

2856
02:04:47.490 --> 02:04:49.140
<v Speaker 1>I think this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this instagram,</v>

2857
02:04:49.170 --> 02:04:52.620
<v Speaker 1>what I'm taken out of this to me is</v>
<v Speaker 1>amusement and humor.</v>

2858
02:04:52.710 --> 02:04:54.870
<v Speaker 1>This is what I'm getting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see it as a persona,</v>

2859
02:04:54.871 --> 02:04:57.750
<v Speaker 1>like it's a gimmick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that picture on the couch.</v>

2860
02:04:57.980 --> 02:05:02.430
<v Speaker 1>Like to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is an exaggeration of all the</v>

2861
02:05:02.431 --> 02:05:07.170
<v Speaker 1>stereotypes of some super rich guy that</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't exist.</v>

2862
02:05:07.171 --> 02:05:09.420
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got the girl me hanging around in</v>

2863
02:05:09.421 --> 02:05:10.980
<v Speaker 1>their underwear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all in lingerie,</v>

2864
02:05:11.010 --> 02:05:13.840
<v Speaker 1>but if this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is leftover random picture,</v>

2865
02:05:14.630 --> 02:05:15.990
<v Speaker 1>would that be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

2866
02:05:16.050 --> 02:05:17.220
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2867
02:05:17.221 --> 02:05:18.540
<v Speaker 1>just think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

2868
02:05:18.541 --> 02:05:20.250

<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2919
02:07:14.530 --> 02:07:17.700
<v Speaker 1>That's</v>
<v Speaker 1>my problem with you is you're acting</v>

2920
02:07:17.701 --> 02:07:18.900
<v Speaker 1>like your mother teresa.</v>

2921
02:07:18.900 --> 02:07:23.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing all this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not coming down to the fact is that</v>

2922
02:07:23.840 --> 02:07:25.950
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do live in a culture that somehow</v>

2923
02:07:26.370 --> 02:07:29.160
<v Speaker 1>celebrates that and I just find it kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of boring.</v>

2924
02:07:29.190 --> 02:07:30.023
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

2925
02:07:30.420 --> 02:07:33.330
<v Speaker 1>But for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to,</v>

2926
02:07:33.360 --> 02:07:35.590
<v Speaker 1>but you don't have to celebrate it to</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2927
02:07:35.830 --> 02:07:36.371
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2928
02:07:36.371 --> 02:07:39.250
<v Speaker 1>it is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's part of the folly of humanity.</v>

2929
02:07:39.251 --> 02:07:40.150
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>

2930
02:07:40.190 --> 02:07:43.570
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a music or taking a sense</v>
<v Speaker 1>of humor and you should be,</v>

2931
02:07:43.571 --> 02:07:46.000
<v Speaker 1>you should take a humorous approach to</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2932
02:07:46.140 --> 02:07:47.970
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet you that guy dan bilzerian is</v>

2933
02:07:47.980 --> 02:07:49.780
<v Speaker 1>probably actually a funny guy and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>silly goose.</v>

2934
02:07:49.900 --> 02:07:51.520
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I met him he was very nice.</v>

2935
02:07:51.560 --> 02:07:52.990
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't assume that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2936
02:07:53.680 --> 02:07:57.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a shit what I was using him</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an expression.</v>

2937
02:08:01.270 --> 02:08:05.830
<v Speaker 1>It's an expression of kind of what this</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture has to offer.</v>

2938
02:08:05.831 --> 02:08:09.640
<v Speaker 1>Whenever you make a point and I see</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're wearing boots and these are like</v>

2939
02:08:09.641 --> 02:08:14.641
<v Speaker 1>a taser to zip up boots too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I see that and you need cross your</v>

2940
02:08:14.711 --> 02:08:17.140
<v Speaker 1>legs and has a really elegant way that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't even do.</v>

2941
02:08:17.800 --> 02:08:20.290
<v Speaker 1>You can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that you can't cross flexible</v>

2942
02:08:20.760 --> 02:08:22.390
<v Speaker 1>enough that dick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got fat,</v>

2943
02:08:23.110 --> 02:08:24.790
<v Speaker 1>but I also have fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let it happen.</v>

2944

<v Speaker 1>I tell leg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I take my skinny jeans on it happening.</v>

2945
02:08:27.790 --> 02:08:31.540
<v Speaker 1>I tape my genitals down to my mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

2946
02:08:31.960 --> 02:08:33.910
<v Speaker 1>I see you're wearing the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>stretchy jeans.</v>

2947
02:08:34.160 --> 02:08:36.550
<v Speaker 1>They're wearing them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you were doing during the kid,</v>

2948
02:08:36.551 --> 02:08:39.160
<v Speaker 1>it's all or were you wearing them now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are my five for jeans.</v>

<v Speaker 1>jeans are my five fours.</v>

2950
02:08:45.040 --> 02:08:46.660
<v Speaker 1>Five fourths.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are stretchy jeans.</v>

2951
02:08:46.661 --> 02:08:49.770
<v Speaker 1>That's what I will call it a stretch to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why do you guys need stretchy jeans</v>

02:12:21.490 --> 02:12:24.950

3033
02:12:31.010 --> 02:12:35.300
<v Speaker 1>It's funny how a giant crowd like that</v>
<v Speaker 1>though in some ways is so different than</v>

3034
02:12:35.301 --> 02:12:38.750
<v Speaker 1>like an intimate crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Works like timing's yeah.</v>

3035
02:12:39.100 --> 02:12:41.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The laughter kind of roles and you got</v>

3036
02:12:41.341 --> 02:12:43.560
<v Speaker 1>to wait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas I'm here.</v>

3037
02:12:43.620 --> 02:12:46.190
<v Speaker 1>You're not aware of your effect with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>huge crowd like that.</v>

3038
02:12:46.220 --> 02:12:48.670
<v Speaker 1>In the same way as you're aware of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>effect with 200 people,</v>

3039
02:12:48.671 --> 02:12:49.940
<v Speaker 1>you have you ever sat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3040
02:12:49.950 --> 02:12:54.290
<v Speaker 1>what's a really good thing to do is sit</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the audience when someone's on stage</v>

3041
02:12:54.291 --> 02:12:55.700
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you ever get a chance,</v>

3042
02:12:55.760 --> 02:13:00.650
<v Speaker 1>like if you want to see Louis Black.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was working the night after he was at</v>

3043
02:13:00.651 --> 02:13:05.480
<v Speaker 1>a theater in New Jersey and me and diaz</v>
<v Speaker 1>went across the street to the theater</v>

3044
02:13:05.750 --> 02:13:06.690
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3045
02:13:06.740 --> 02:13:09.770
<v Speaker 1>we sat down in the audience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We actually got like seats in a nice</v>

3046
02:13:09.771 --> 02:13:12.530
<v Speaker 1>spot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was a nice spot like in the</v>

3047
02:13:12.530 --> 02:13:16.880
<v Speaker 1>middle towards the back and I was amazed</v>
<v Speaker 1>at how difficult it is to understand</v>

3048
02:13:16.990 --> 02:13:21.650
<v Speaker 1>really what he's saying once the</v>
<v Speaker 1>laughter roles because when you're on</v>

3049
02:13:21.651 --> 02:13:23.780
<v Speaker 1>stage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're on stage,</v>

3050
02:13:23.850 --> 02:13:25.610
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hear your mic,</v>

3051
02:13:25.611 --> 02:13:29.120
<v Speaker 1>you have monitors that are projecting</v>
<v Speaker 1>towards you and you're saying things and</v>

3052
02:13:29.121 --> 02:13:31.130
<v Speaker 1>the punchline hits and then the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>laugh.</v>

3053
02:13:31.470 --> 02:13:33.810
<v Speaker 1>You have to be real careful what you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>

3054
02:13:33.811 --> 02:13:35.460
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are laughing.</v>

3055
02:13:35.660 --> 02:13:38.310
<v Speaker 1>Don't miss it because it's different</v>
<v Speaker 1>than a comedy club in a comedy club.</v>

3056
02:13:38.311 --> 02:13:39.980
<v Speaker 1>You can just hammer over it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3057
02:13:40.050 --> 02:13:42.630
<v Speaker 1>There's 200 people in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You say something that's funny,</v>

3058
02:13:42.780 --> 02:13:46.290
<v Speaker 1>they're laughing and you could add a tag</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the middle of it and it makes even</v>

3059
02:13:46.291 --> 02:13:48.840
<v Speaker 1>funny ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joey diaz as the master of that.</v>

3060
02:13:49.050 --> 02:13:50.710
<v Speaker 1>He just like in the middle of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>laughing,</v>

3061
02:13:50.711 --> 02:13:53.280
<v Speaker 1>it'll slam you with something else and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then slammed me with something else.</v>

3062
02:13:53.610 --> 02:13:57.390
<v Speaker 1>But in a theater that's like 3000 plus</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

3063
02:13:57.420 --> 02:14:00.780
<v Speaker 1>You have to wait because when I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting in the audience it,</v>

3064
02:14:00.810 --> 02:14:02.220
<v Speaker 1>it occurred to me like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>to it.</v>

3084
02:14:52.740 --> 02:14:55.430
<v Speaker 1>But going back to your point about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>theater,</v>

02:14:56.020 --> 02:14:57.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm brand new at this so I thought</v>

<v Speaker 1>everything was the same and brian and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>went to do the shows like 700 people</v>

3087
02:15:01.891 --> 02:15:04.980
<v Speaker 1>sold out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was a giant ballroom and brian's</v>

3088
02:15:04.981 --> 02:15:07.380
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now don't get discouraged because you're</v>

3089
02:15:07.381 --> 02:15:08.940

3090
02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:09.833
<v Speaker 1>So I'd like,</v>

3098
02:15:21.931 --> 02:15:23.310
<v Speaker 1>crowd's reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll get off stage.</v>

3115
02:16:03.661 --> 02:16:06.300
<v Speaker 1>but he would do carbs just because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was so enjoyable.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I think she's 49.</v>

3428
02:30:19.810 --> 02:30:21.430
<v Speaker 2>I think she's a little older than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think she's.</v>

3429
02:30:21.940 --> 02:30:22.610
<v Speaker 2>She's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's,</v>

<v Speaker 2>They have this,</v>

<v Speaker 2>stops and they start taking photos of</v>
<v Speaker 2>her and she just starts posing.</v>

3439
02:30:54.470 --> 02:30:56.560
<v Speaker 2>So no one talks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one's taught like everyone's just</v>

3440
02:30:56.570 --> 02:30:58.490
<v Speaker 2>watching because it's naomi campbell</v>
<v Speaker 2>party,</v>

3441
02:30:58.610 --> 02:31:00.920

3445
02:31:17.301 --> 02:31:19.620
<v Speaker 2>party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a good thing to dip my toe into</v>

3446
02:31:19.621 --> 02:31:22.230
<v Speaker 2>and get the fuck out of there as quickly</v>
<v Speaker 2>as realize why you don't go to.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I like to stay on the outskirts,</v>

3466
02:32:04.501 --> 02:32:06.480
<v Speaker 2>that list.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like to be in the suburbs that last.</v>

3470
02:32:17.860 --> 02:32:19.500
<v Speaker 2>Slowing down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>slowing down.</v>

3471
02:32:20.830 --> 02:32:23.090
<v Speaker 2>Thinking about moving to like yosemite,</v>

02:32:30.901 --> 02:32:33.840
<v Speaker 2>If I give you one other alternative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a few different possibilities.</v>

3476
02:32:34.710 --> 02:32:37.290
<v Speaker 2>I really liked Colorado have always</v>
<v Speaker 2>liked Colorado.</v>

3477
02:32:37.410 --> 02:32:39.300
<v Speaker 2>Colorado is always going to be one of my</v>
<v Speaker 2>best choIces.</v>

3478
02:32:39.330 --> 02:32:41.280
<v Speaker 2>He's been there though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked the people.</v>

3479
02:32:41.460 --> 02:32:43.380
<v Speaker 2>I liked the environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like the vibe.</v>

3480
02:32:43.770 --> 02:32:47.400
<v Speaker 2>I like standup community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like the comedy works and I love</v>

3481
02:32:47.401 --> 02:32:48.900
<v Speaker 2>wendy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The owner of the comedy works.</v>

3482
02:32:49.590 --> 02:32:52.000
<v Speaker 2>That's the spot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the spot where I could live a.</v>

3483
02:32:52.010 --> 02:32:53.880
<v Speaker 2>I could live in seattle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just couldn't deal with the winter.</v>

3484
02:32:54.120 --> 02:32:56.400
<v Speaker 2>I just think it's stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think regional</v>

3485
02:32:58.140 --> 02:32:59.730
<v Speaker 2>folks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it rains too much up there.</v>

3486
02:32:59.760 --> 02:33:03.800
<v Speaker 2>Your summers are of the guys and I get</v>
<v Speaker 2>it that you have to like.</v>

3487
02:33:03.810 --> 02:33:06.060
<v Speaker 2>It makes you appreciate one when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have the other,</v>

3488
02:33:06.061 --> 02:33:11.061
<v Speaker 2>but it's hard to know that all I do is</v>
<v Speaker 2>get on a jet and I could be in la and</v>

3489
02:33:11.251 --> 02:33:15.300
<v Speaker 2>it's perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem in la right now is that it's</v>

3490
02:33:15.360 --> 02:33:18.720
<v Speaker 2>really good like comedy wines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's never been better.</v>

3491
02:33:18.960 --> 02:33:20.520
<v Speaker 2>Like there's more clubs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's more.</v>

3492
02:33:20.521 --> 02:33:22.740

<v Speaker 2>where else can this take place?</v>

3496

<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so rAre that you'll go there and</v>

<v Speaker 2>wall hanging.</v>

3502
02:33:43.690 --> 02:33:47.000
<v Speaker 2>Don't you think if you move to denver,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your podcast would suffer because you're</v>

3503
02:33:47.001 --> 02:33:49.320
<v Speaker 2>not going to have as many big guest</v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>find out who doesn't care.</v>

3505
02:33:52.660 --> 02:33:56.100
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can always fly in once a week and do</v>

3506
02:33:56.310 --> 02:33:58.530
<v Speaker 2>that would get tired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I probably have a free weekend flex on</v>

3509
02:33:59.970 --> 02:34:03.420
<v Speaker 2>Well I can definitely fly someone there</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they were willing to go,</v>

3510
02:34:03.570 --> 02:34:06.650
<v Speaker 2>I could look for like local people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that would run dry very,</v>

3511
02:34:06.710 --> 02:34:09.060
<v Speaker 2>very full on denver.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3512
02:34:11.380 --> 02:34:16.380
<v Speaker 2>There's no better spot than la to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>podcasts and stand up and stand up this</v>

3513
02:34:16.870 --> 02:34:19.590
<v Speaker 2>kit find better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's also the,</v>

3514
02:34:19.591 --> 02:34:22.690
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the vast numbers of human beings that</v>

3552
02:35:53.261 --> 02:35:55.480
<v Speaker 2>time in more than one place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3553
02:35:55.700 --> 02:35:57.820
<v Speaker 2>the only thing that holds me back</v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

3554
02:35:58.060 --> 02:36:00.760
<v Speaker 2>it's not really holding me back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but having a family,</v>

3555
02:36:00.820 --> 02:36:03.260
<v Speaker 2>like you have to take them into</v>
<v Speaker 2>consideration when you make any move</v>

3556
02:36:04.120 --> 02:36:06.220
<v Speaker 2>them around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kids don't like that stability.</v>

3557
02:36:06.221 --> 02:36:07.054
<v Speaker 2>Some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3558
02:36:07.070 --> 02:36:08.800
<v Speaker 2>So I grew up there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my to me,</v>

3559
02:36:09.740 --> 02:36:11.380
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'll tell you one thing,</v>

3560
02:36:11.590 --> 02:36:14.110
<v Speaker 2>when they turn 18,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they decided to go to college</v>

3561
02:36:14.111 --> 02:36:16.540
<v Speaker 2>somewhere and move somewhere else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm ghost.</v>

3562
02:36:17.220 --> 02:36:19.240
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no way I'm going to be doing</v>

3563
02:36:19.241 --> 02:36:20.170
<v Speaker 2>this in 10 years.</v>

3564
02:36:20.440 --> 02:36:23.440
<v Speaker 2>There's no way I'm going to because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't think the city sustainable.</v>

3565
02:36:23.560 --> 02:36:27.060
<v Speaker 2>I think the city is like a game of</v>
<v Speaker 2>musical chairs and I think after awhile</v>

3566
02:36:27.130 --> 02:36:28.690
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be Mexico city.</v>

3567
02:36:28.720 --> 02:36:30.730
<v Speaker 2>I've been to Mexico city.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what it's like.</v>

3568
02:36:30.760 --> 02:36:32.920
<v Speaker 2>It's overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The amount of people,</v>

3569
02:36:32.921 --> 02:36:36.640
<v Speaker 2>like the traffic jams are insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you go through them and you're</v>

3570
02:36:36.641 --> 02:36:37.900
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how is this real?</v>

3571
02:36:38.050 --> 02:36:41.530
<v Speaker 2>Nobody gives a fuck about a red light or</v>
<v Speaker 2>a green light and when they want to</v>

3572
02:36:41.531 --> 02:36:44.170
<v Speaker 2>merge they just have to shut themselves</v>
<v Speaker 2>out into traffic.</v>

3573
02:36:44.171 --> 02:36:46.870
<v Speaker 2>Nobody lets you in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I remember sitting there thinking</v>

3574
02:36:46.871 --> 02:36:48.970
<v Speaker 2>they're watching this going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's this beautiful city,</v>

3575
02:36:48.971 --> 02:36:52.210
<v Speaker 2>this crazy ancient city in the mountains</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Mexico.</v>

3576
02:36:52.211 --> 02:36:54.430
<v Speaker 2>Six,</v>
<v Speaker 2>7,000 feet above sea level,</v>

3577
02:36:54.630 --> 02:36:58.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just with 20 plus million people stuffed</v>

3578
02:36:58.271 --> 02:37:02.890
<v Speaker 2>in it and like la is not that far off</v>
<v Speaker 2>and las growth from the time I moved</v>

3579
02:37:02.891 --> 02:37:06.970
<v Speaker 2>here in 1994 to today in 2016 is</v>
<v Speaker 2>unbelievable.</v>

3580
02:37:07.240 --> 02:37:09.730
<v Speaker 2>Twenty two years later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Operating values are so because I know</v>

3581
02:37:09.731 --> 02:37:11.590
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's going to happen here.</v>

3582
02:37:11.591 --> 02:37:13.480
<v Speaker 2>You think it's going to keep going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep going.</v>

3583
02:37:13.510 --> 02:37:15.380
<v Speaker 2>What's gonna happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are going to wise up and become</v>

3584
02:37:15.381 --> 02:37:16.040
<v Speaker 2>awesome.</v>

3585
02:37:16.040 --> 02:37:17.750
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're gonna keep going to keep moving</v>

3586
02:37:17.751 --> 02:37:19.070
<v Speaker 3>here because we're show business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

3587
02:37:19.610 --> 02:37:21.170
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to convince my dad to move</v>
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>

3588
02:37:21.171 --> 02:37:24.170
<v Speaker 3>especially because his grandsons here</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so he doesn't seem like that</v>

3589
02:37:24.300 --> 02:37:26.420
<v Speaker 3>movement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's different though.</v>

3590
02:37:26.421 --> 02:37:28.390
<v Speaker 3>I mean that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3591
02:37:28.470 --> 02:37:29.920
<v Speaker 3>to live here with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3592
02:37:30.170 --> 02:37:31.220
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're here,</v>

3593
02:37:31.221 --> 02:37:32.990
<v Speaker 3>your business is here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and your family's here.</v>

3594
02:37:33.020 --> 02:37:34.670
<v Speaker 3>If that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People will move though.</v>

3595
02:37:34.671 --> 02:37:38.020
<v Speaker 3>The thing is it's so expensive to live</v>
<v Speaker 3>here like anything else.</v>

3596
02:37:38.210 --> 02:37:39.950
<v Speaker 3>What happens is people go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

3597
02:37:39.951 --> 02:37:40.820
<v Speaker 3>la is great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

3598
02:37:40.821 --> 02:37:42.350
<v Speaker 3>this is place raleigh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>North Carolina.</v>

3599
02:37:42.351 --> 02:37:45.260
<v Speaker 3>They're really do with a billion</v>
<v Speaker 3>infrastructure and people move to those</v>

3600
02:37:45.261 --> 02:37:46.710
<v Speaker 3>places of nashville,</v>
<v Speaker 3>raleigh.</v>

3601
02:37:47.450 --> 02:37:49.430
<v Speaker 3>Look what happened to portland.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's secret.</v>

3602
02:37:49.431 --> 02:37:50.600
<v Speaker 3>Got out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People moved there.</v>

3603
02:37:50.601 --> 02:37:52.790
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the secret's out the winter sucks,</v>

3604
02:37:53.810 --> 02:37:57.710
<v Speaker 3>but as you get like one of the things I</v>
<v Speaker 3>noticed is like I'll be in places like</v>

3605
02:37:57.711 --> 02:38:01.040
<v Speaker 3>that place we were in in Oklahoma slash</v>
<v Speaker 3>Arkansas and middle of nowhere.</v>

3606
02:38:01.041 --> 02:38:04.580
<v Speaker 3>This tiny little beautiful town.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We found the best coffee shop with the</v>

3607
02:38:04.581 --> 02:38:07.190
<v Speaker 3>best single source,</v>
<v Speaker 3>single origin shade,</v>

3608
02:38:07.191 --> 02:38:08.240
<v Speaker 3>grown coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3609
02:38:08.420 --> 02:38:10.880
<v Speaker 3>designer fucking coffee worthy of keith</v>
<v Speaker 3>jardine.</v>

3610
02:38:10.881 --> 02:38:12.640
<v Speaker 3>This is the kind of shit that he gets</v>
<v Speaker 3>excited about,</v>

3611
02:38:12.700 --> 02:38:16.010
<v Speaker 3>but</v>
<v Speaker 3>we ate great food too.</v>

3612
02:38:16.011 --> 02:38:20.410
<v Speaker 3>We had a great</v>
<v Speaker 3>high.</v>

3613
02:38:20.690 --> 02:38:24.650
<v Speaker 3>No phones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know Oklahoma hall.</v>

3614
02:38:27.380 --> 02:38:31.520
<v Speaker 3>Here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's good places in small towns from</v>

3615
02:38:31.521 --> 02:38:34.220
<v Speaker 3>20 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The internet is here and people are</v>

3616
02:38:34.221 --> 02:38:36.800
<v Speaker 3>evolving and changing everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a different world.</v>

3617
02:38:36.830 --> 02:38:40.310
<v Speaker 3>You can find a lot of what you liked</v>
<v Speaker 3>from big cities and small towns now more</v>

3618
02:38:40.311 --> 02:38:41.450
<v Speaker 3>and more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more and more,</v>

3619
02:38:41.510 --> 02:38:44.980
<v Speaker 3>and I think that that it's important to</v>
<v Speaker 3>note that the look,</v>

3620
02:38:44.981 --> 02:38:48.470
<v Speaker 3>the only reason to be in la,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of retro until I have all</v>

3621
02:38:48.471 --> 02:38:51.290
<v Speaker 3>these people jammed in together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea is that this is where the cool</v>

3622
02:38:51.291 --> 02:38:52.460
<v Speaker 3>people are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is where we have to live.</v>

3623
02:38:52.490 --> 02:38:54.830
<v Speaker 3>This is where show businesses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what kind of show business are you</v>

3624
02:38:54.831 --> 02:38:56.930
<v Speaker 3>really involved in anymore other than</v>
<v Speaker 3>the goldbergs.</v>

3625
02:38:56.990 --> 02:39:00.440
<v Speaker 3>I guess that's like the last traditional</v>
<v Speaker 3>client about that too and a lot of stuff</v>

3626
02:39:00.441 --> 02:39:03.380
<v Speaker 3>doesn't shoot in la,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also you don't want to shoot anyway.</v>

3627
02:39:03.560 --> 02:39:04.670
<v Speaker 3>There's stuff that you're doing.</v>

3628
02:39:04.670 --> 02:39:06.560
<v Speaker 3>Most of it is you doing standup on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>road.</v>

<v Speaker 1>like a high school girl when they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>first starting out.</v>

3743
02:44:03.250 --> 02:44:05.860
<v Speaker 1>Has they hold onto the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have like little stopper.</v>

3744
02:44:06.360 --> 02:44:07.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That horse is not buying that.</v>

3745
02:44:08.380 --> 02:44:13.090
<v Speaker 1>Just the tip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to put an inflatable safety</v>

3746
02:44:13.091 --> 02:44:14.800
<v Speaker 1>ring on that bad boy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't get to stop that.</v>

3747
02:44:14.801 --> 02:44:17.170
<v Speaker 1>Fucking males.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's this weird.</v>

3748
02:44:17.230 --> 02:44:21.610
<v Speaker 1>It's weird because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's weird because they've met online in</v>

3749
02:44:21.611 --> 02:44:24.040
<v Speaker 1>a forum where people were turned on by</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>

3750
02:44:24.060 --> 02:44:27.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they met on this forum and then</v>

3751
02:44:27.431 --> 02:44:31.600
<v Speaker 1>decided to meet in this place that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>legal in Washington state.</v>

3752
02:44:31.601 --> 02:44:34.870
<v Speaker 1>It was legal until recently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As long as the animal's penetrating you.</v>

3753
02:44:34.871 --> 02:44:37.720
<v Speaker 1>If you're penetrating the animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that shit's illegal son.</v>

3754
02:44:37.810 --> 02:44:40.260
<v Speaker 1>LIke you can't fuck a horse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's you.</v>

3755
02:44:40.500 --> 02:44:42.150
<v Speaker 1>I guess that changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's mr.</v>

3756
02:44:42.240 --> 02:44:43.480
<v Speaker 1>Van dyke is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense.</v>

3757
02:44:43.481 --> 02:44:46.200
<v Speaker 1>That's like that guy jonathan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so balls deep in it,</v>

3758
02:44:46.240 --> 02:44:49.480
<v Speaker 1>but as soon as I was that I was on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>plane just researching the shit out of</v>

3759
02:44:49.481 --> 02:44:50.920
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was this guy jonathan haidt</v>

3760
02:44:50.921 --> 02:44:52.450
<v Speaker 1>who's a social scientist talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

3761
02:44:52.451 --> 02:44:55.080
<v Speaker 1>like certain things are legal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they,</v>

3762
02:44:55.100 --> 02:44:58.300
<v Speaker 1>they elicit a disgust response even</v>
<v Speaker 1>though they don't hurt anybody.</v>

3763
02:44:58.300 --> 02:45:01.360
<v Speaker 1>So like he does this example of um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two things where he goes,</v>

3764
02:45:01.540 --> 02:45:06.430
<v Speaker 1>if a brother and sister are in the woods</v>
<v Speaker 1>having sex with a condom on,</v>

3765
02:45:07.090 --> 02:45:09.910
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing inherently harmful to</v>
<v Speaker 1>both of them.</v>

3766
02:45:09.911 --> 02:45:11.380
<v Speaker 1>But all of us go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3767
02:45:11.530 --> 02:45:15.040
<v Speaker 1>or If the guy jerks off or if a guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucks a chicken,</v>

3768
02:45:15.041 --> 02:45:16.540
<v Speaker 1>then eats it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all go,</v>

3769
02:45:16.610 --> 02:45:19.360
<v Speaker 1>god daMn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's now really the chicken's</v>

3770
02:45:19.361 --> 02:45:20.370
<v Speaker 1>already dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

3771
02:45:20.710 --> 02:45:25.120
<v Speaker 1>And it elicits in disgust reaction even</v>
<v Speaker 1>though it technically you can't really</v>

3772
02:45:25.450 --> 02:45:28.960
<v Speaker 1>define why it's wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why you signed to that bit about it.</v>

3773
02:45:28.990 --> 02:45:31.630
<v Speaker 1>But why is it okay to kill something?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you can't fuck it after you kill it.</v>

3774
02:45:32.240 --> 02:45:34.060
<v Speaker 1>That's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't do that.</v>

3775
02:45:34.061 --> 02:45:35.920
<v Speaker 1>But if you jerked off of the chicken</v>
<v Speaker 1>cutlet,</v>

3776
02:45:35.921 --> 02:45:37.960
<v Speaker 1>I bet you wouldn't go to jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody call you,</v>

3777
02:45:38.060 --> 02:45:41.110
<v Speaker 1>caught you fucking a chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people be really mad,</v>

3778
02:45:41.260 --> 02:45:44.140
<v Speaker 1>but if you just took the breast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chicken breast wrapped around your</v>

3779
02:45:44.141 --> 02:45:46.210
<v Speaker 1>dick and jerked off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one can say shit.</v>

3780
02:45:46.390 --> 02:45:47.080
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we,</v>

3781
02:45:47.080 --> 02:45:51.850
<v Speaker 1>we still have thIs automatic discussed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird to like ground beef.</v>

3782
02:45:51.880 --> 02:45:54.960
<v Speaker 1>If you take ground beef and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just take like</v>

3783
02:45:56.800 --> 02:46:00.130
<v Speaker 1>warm it up to like body temperature and</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a plastic ziploc bag,</v>

3784
02:46:00.340 --> 02:46:03.540
<v Speaker 1>wrap it around your dick and just start</v>
<v Speaker 1>jerking yourself with this warm basal a</v>

3785
02:46:03.550 --> 02:46:05.410
<v Speaker 1>terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you knew that you allowed to do</v>

3786
02:46:05.440 --> 02:46:07.370
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess you can do that</v>

3787
02:46:08.990 --> 02:46:10.250
<v Speaker 1>where people might not invite</v>

3788
02:46:10.250 --> 02:46:12.560
<v Speaker 2>you to their cocktail party,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you get caught fucking a pig,</v>

3789
02:46:12.561 --> 02:46:14.240
<v Speaker 2>even if the pigs having a great old</v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

3790
02:46:14.480 --> 02:46:17.870
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you a fucking pig.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the pigs like loving it,</v>

3791
02:46:19.010 --> 02:46:19.970
<v Speaker 2>loving it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that,</v>

3792
02:46:19.971 --> 02:46:23.840
<v Speaker 2>is that your big impression pig?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just really hitting at the right spot</v>

3793
02:46:23.841 --> 02:46:25.030
<v Speaker 2>that pigs like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh</v>

3794
02:46:27.620 --> 02:46:29.510
<v Speaker 2>that's illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's illegal.</v>

3795
02:46:29.590 --> 02:46:33.980
<v Speaker 2>Like even if the pig like finds you and</v>
<v Speaker 2>starts backing up towards you since you</v>

3796
02:46:33.981 --> 02:46:37.310
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you bend over in that pigs like,</v>

3797
02:46:37.311 --> 02:46:39.140
<v Speaker 2>yo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me get that at that asshole.</v>

3798
02:46:39.560 --> 02:46:41.290
<v Speaker 2>It's legal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's go back to danville.</v>

3799
02:46:41.370 --> 02:46:42.560
<v Speaker 2>No talking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3800
02:46:42.590 --> 02:46:46.370
<v Speaker 2>it's not necessarily legal and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>think it's legal in Washington state</v>

3801
02:46:46.380 --> 02:46:48.440
<v Speaker 2>anyMore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mr dan stein.</v>

3802
02:46:48.560 --> 02:46:51.890
<v Speaker 2>But it's not like a proactive active.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's.</v>

3803
02:46:51.950 --> 02:46:54.950
<v Speaker 2>I think it's illegal to just be engaging</v>
<v Speaker 2>in sex.</v>

3804
02:46:55.060 --> 02:46:55.893
<v Speaker 2>I think it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3805
02:46:55.940 --> 02:46:58.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In a weird who gives us the questions</v>

3806
02:46:58.180 --> 02:46:59.510
<v Speaker 2>like can you do body parts?</v>

3807
02:47:00.320 --> 02:47:01.980
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3808
02:47:02.920 --> 02:47:06.380
<v Speaker 2>what about the guy who paid the guy to</v>
<v Speaker 2>kill them and eat them?</v>

3809
02:47:06.590 --> 02:47:08.990
<v Speaker 2>And they ate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They ate his genitals together.</v>

3810
02:47:09.050 --> 02:47:11.000
<v Speaker 2>They need is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They stick together.</v>

3811
02:47:11.240 --> 02:47:13.640
<v Speaker 2>Like technically there was a legal</v>
<v Speaker 2>quagmire.</v>

3812
02:47:13.641 --> 02:47:14.451
<v Speaker 2>There were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>didn't want to craigslist and we end.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Oh yes.</v>

3816
02:47:24.380 --> 02:47:26.510
<v Speaker 2>He wanted to be slaughtered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Put an ad out on craigslist.</v>

3817
02:47:26.520 --> 02:47:29.810
<v Speaker 2>And where was that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And some dude was like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'll do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>genitals and serve them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Know this is a different one.</v>

<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3824
02:47:43.520 --> 02:47:46.910
<v Speaker 2>this is a guy who didn't like his</v>
<v Speaker 2>gender.</v>

3825
02:47:46.970 --> 02:47:50.930
<v Speaker 2>He was asexual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he decided to cut his dick and balls</v>

3826
02:47:50.931 --> 02:47:53.110
<v Speaker 2>off and then serve them.</v>

<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3829
02:47:56.150 --> 02:47:59.030
<v Speaker 2>he.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They knew they were garnished with</v>

3830
02:47:59.031 --> 02:48:02.360
<v Speaker 2>mushrooms and parsley.</v>
<v Speaker 2>they paid a 160.</v>

3831
02:48:02.361 --> 02:48:04.850
<v Speaker 2>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pounds per person.</v>

3832
02:48:05.420 --> 02:48:07.430
<v Speaker 2>Way too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Way too much to eat.</v>

3833
02:48:07.431 --> 02:48:10.730
<v Speaker 2>His severed genitalium mushrooms and</v>
<v Speaker 2>parsley.</v>

3834
02:48:10.790 --> 02:48:13.760
<v Speaker 2>I like mine with lemon damn paper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get everything though.</v>

3835
02:48:13.820 --> 02:48:16.460
<v Speaker 2>You get the shaft,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the testes and the scrotum.</v>

3836
02:48:16.520 --> 02:48:19.400
<v Speaker 2>look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He cooked the genitalia himself as he</v>

3837
02:48:19.401 --> 02:48:22.220
<v Speaker 2>was supervised by a chef.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

3838
02:48:22.221 --> 02:48:24.890
<v Speaker 2>In a tweet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He offered to cook his penis for a guest</v>

3839
02:48:24.891 --> 02:48:26.260
<v Speaker 2>for whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's quickly.</v>

3840
02:48:26.350 --> 02:48:27.800
<v Speaker 2>mark,</v>
<v Speaker 2>male genitals,</v>

3841
02:48:28.040 --> 02:48:31.650
<v Speaker 2>full penis testes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scrotum them as a meal for 100,000.</v>

3842
02:48:31.651 --> 02:48:33.410
<v Speaker 2>In the end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's 800 pounds.</v>

3843
02:48:33.620 --> 02:48:35.590
<v Speaker 2>So that's roughly what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A thousand dollars.</v>

3844
02:48:35.630 --> 02:48:37.900
<v Speaker 2>1,200 little asian guy though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a</v>

3845
02:48:39.970 --> 02:48:42.560
<v Speaker 2>dollar less than dollar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it varies,</v>

3846
02:48:42.650 --> 02:48:43.483
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3847
02:48:43.550 --> 02:48:46.300
<v Speaker 2>It's more now it's worth more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So 800 pounds,</v>

3848
02:48:46.320 --> 02:48:48.860
<v Speaker 2>like a thousand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He decided to split the meal between six</v>

3849
02:48:48.861 --> 02:48:50.450
<v Speaker 2>guests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're not getting a lot of dick for</v>

3850
02:48:50.451 --> 02:48:52.700
<v Speaker 2>your money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The organs were surgically removed at</v>

3851
02:48:52.701 --> 02:48:56.060
<v Speaker 2>age 22.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was tested to be free of venereal</v>

3852
02:48:56.061 --> 02:48:58.730
<v Speaker 2>diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The organs were of normal function.</v>

3853
02:48:58.760 --> 02:49:01.400
<v Speaker 2>I was not receiving female hormone</v>
<v Speaker 2>treatment,</v>

3854
02:49:02.150 --> 02:49:05.960
<v Speaker 2>so he took the dick and balls away a</v>
<v Speaker 2>year ago.</v>

3855
02:49:06.500 --> 02:49:07.590

<v Speaker 2>up at his door with my every bite.</v>

4004
02:55:53.841 --> 02:55:58.310
<v Speaker 2>My memory of him grew stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy behind bars.</v>

4005
02:55:58.311 --> 02:56:01.220
<v Speaker 2>Muse told detectives that he first</v>
<v Speaker 2>consumed his victim with the bottom of</v>

<v Speaker 2>The unprecedented case had proven</v>

4011
02:56:19.161 --> 02:56:22.400
<v Speaker 2>problematic for german lawyers who</v>
<v Speaker 2>discovered the cannibalism is not</v>

4012
02:56:22.430 --> 02:56:24.230
<v Speaker 2>illegal in Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's murder.</v>

<v Speaker 3>We just put some twizzlers and were</v>
<v Speaker 3>done.</v>

4198
03:04:34.341 --> 03:04:35.570
<v Speaker 3>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am,</v>

4199
03:04:35.571 --> 03:04:38.500
<v Speaker 3>but if you put in my face like the</v>
<v Speaker 3>cadbury egg,</v>

4200
03:04:38.510 --> 03:04:39.730
<v Speaker 3>like yoda,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ugly this week.</v>

4201
03:04:39.730 --> 03:04:40.810
<v Speaker 3>Oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's this?</v>

4202
03:04:41.290 --> 03:04:43.070
<v Speaker 3>When do a goddamn thing to me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>

4203
03:04:43.071 --> 03:04:44.450
<v Speaker 3>if you really weak this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4204
03:04:44.750 --> 03:04:47.060
<v Speaker 3>chili mangoes faze me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't cheated.</v>

4205
03:04:47.061 --> 03:04:49.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doug and I said something else in that</v>

4206
03:04:49.731 --> 03:04:52.030
<v Speaker 3>bag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I walked in and you had fresh cadbury</v>

4207
03:04:52.031 --> 03:04:53.960
<v Speaker 3>eggs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>peel from the wrapper without those</v>

4208
03:04:53.961 --> 03:04:55.430
<v Speaker 3>chili mangoes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We actually just opened one of those</v>

4209
03:04:55.431 --> 03:04:56.500
<v Speaker 3>bags.</v>
<v Speaker 3>let you smell it.</v>

4210
03:04:57.440 --> 03:04:58.770
<v Speaker 3>I'll get excited.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4211
03:04:59.330 --> 03:05:02.000
<v Speaker 3>if you had the five or you can only five</v>
<v Speaker 3>foods,</v>

4212
03:05:02.001 --> 03:05:03.950
<v Speaker 3>what would they be?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Temporary eggs and my five foods</v>

4213
03:05:03.951 --> 03:05:05.440
<v Speaker 3>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I would,</v>

4214
03:05:05.480 --> 03:05:07.190
<v Speaker 3>if I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I was restricted to that,</v>

4215
03:05:07.191 --> 03:05:09.200
<v Speaker 3>I would do it only based on nutrition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So elk,</v>

4216
03:05:09.230 --> 03:05:10.150
<v Speaker 3>elk meat?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4217
03:05:10.160 --> 03:05:12.320
<v Speaker 3>I would eat something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wild game,</v>

4218
03:05:12.321 --> 03:05:13.520
<v Speaker 3>meat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>avocados,</v>

4219
03:05:13.610 --> 03:05:17.300
<v Speaker 3>healthy vegetables like kale.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would be all boring shit because it</v>

4220
03:05:17.390 --> 03:05:18.410
<v Speaker 3>will help me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not boring,</v>

4221
03:05:18.411 --> 03:05:21.320
<v Speaker 3>but if I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know that I would have to like leave</v>

4222
03:05:21.321 --> 03:05:21.920
<v Speaker 3>it at that.</v>

4223
03:05:21.920 --> 03:05:25.280
<v Speaker 3>But I think if you only ate five things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd probably going to get sick unless</v>

4224
03:05:25.281 --> 03:05:28.580
<v Speaker 3>you're supplementing yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've goT to make sure you're getting a</v>

4225
03:05:28.581 --> 03:05:31.400
<v Speaker 3>proper amount of vitamin c.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd be fucking chance.</v>

4226
03:05:31.430 --> 03:05:33.450
<v Speaker 3>I'd imagined yams,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kale,</v>

4227
03:05:33.470 --> 03:05:34.910
<v Speaker 3>avocado,</v>
<v Speaker 3>elk.</v>

4228
03:05:35.090 --> 03:05:36.230
<v Speaker 3>You get a lot of stuff there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

4229
03:05:36.410 --> 03:05:38.900
<v Speaker 3>I think people benefit more than other</v>
<v Speaker 3>animals too,</v>

4230
03:05:38.930 --> 03:05:42.050
<v Speaker 3>on a variety of different foods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>On varying your diet.</v>

4231
03:05:42.360 --> 03:05:44.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>More like animals have a problem with</v>

4232
03:05:44.121 --> 03:05:44.990
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like dogs,</v>

4233
03:05:44.991 --> 03:05:48.200
<v Speaker 3>like you can't switch up dog food if you</v>
<v Speaker 3>give a dog one kind of food,</v>

4234
03:05:48.210 --> 03:05:51.680
<v Speaker 3>then you give him something else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just get explosive babies the same way</v>

4235
03:05:51.681 --> 03:05:53.280
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you changed the formula baby</v>

4236
03:05:54.230 --> 03:05:56.810
<v Speaker 3>shit everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you get too much iron from eating</v>

4237
03:05:56.811 --> 03:05:59.540
<v Speaker 3>meat every day?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shows much iron.</v>

4238
03:05:59.541 --> 03:06:00.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>

4239
03:06:00.951 --> 03:06:02.930
<v Speaker 3>I've never heard that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had high iron,</v>

4240
03:06:03.310 --> 03:06:05.830
<v Speaker 3>high iron count one time when I went and</v>
<v Speaker 3>got my blood done.</v>

4241
03:06:05.880 --> 03:06:07.430
<v Speaker 3>How much media you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he said,</v>

4242
03:06:07.460 --> 03:06:09.230
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he said,</v>

4243
03:06:09.231 --> 03:06:10.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fucking crazy.</v>

4244
03:06:11.000 --> 03:06:13.880
<v Speaker 3>I was cooking from a cast iron.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

4245
03:06:13.940 --> 03:06:16.640
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the cast iron iron in your food</v>

4246
03:06:17.230 --> 03:06:18.063
<v Speaker 3>tray.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Siren because.</v>

4247
03:06:18.760 --> 03:06:19.850
<v Speaker 3>Hi ferris.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I levels.</v>

4248
03:06:19.870 --> 03:06:20.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I cook a lot.</v>

4249
03:06:20.901 --> 03:06:23.210
<v Speaker 3>And iron pants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the best thing for you.</v>

4250
03:06:23.211 --> 03:06:24.640
<v Speaker 3>It's a good way to get iron.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4251
03:06:24.980 --> 03:06:28.230
<v Speaker 3>Probably a good way for people to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>iron to that are vegetarians like if you</v>

4252
03:06:28.540 --> 03:06:32.180
<v Speaker 3>feel like that's exactly what they tell</v>
<v Speaker 3>vegetarians to cook in a cast iron</v>

4253
03:06:32.210 --> 03:06:32.901
<v Speaker 3>skillet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4254
03:06:32.901 --> 03:06:35.360
<v Speaker 3>That's a good way to do it because you</v>
<v Speaker 3>get low iron if you're a vegetarian,</v>

4255
03:06:35.750 --> 03:06:38.210
<v Speaker 3>you also get a lot of creatine if you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>eating a lot of red meat,</v>

4256
03:06:38.570 --> 03:06:41.330
<v Speaker 3>like you don't need a dose on created.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to take so much creatine,</v>

4257
03:06:41.450 --> 03:06:43.790
<v Speaker 3>but because it's not a little lot of red</v>
<v Speaker 3>meat,</v>

4258
03:06:43.791 --> 03:06:45.050
<v Speaker 3>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't take any credit.</v>

4259
03:06:45.070 --> 03:06:46.970
<v Speaker 3>So you're doinG your keto genic right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4260
03:06:46.971 --> 03:06:49.610
<v Speaker 3>I think creatine is like legit</v>
<v Speaker 3>supplement.</v>

4261
03:06:49.700 --> 03:06:53.090
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the few legit supplements</v>
<v Speaker 3>that actually does really increase your</v>

4262
03:06:53.091 --> 03:06:54.460
<v Speaker 3>strength.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been taken in.</v>

4263
03:06:54.470 --> 03:06:55.650
<v Speaker 3>Recovery does.</v>

4264
03:06:55.980 --> 03:06:57.450
<v Speaker 1>It's legit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4265
03:06:57.451 --> 03:07:01.320
<v Speaker 1>a lot of these things that like the tool</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes back to the yoel yoel romero thing</v>

4266
03:07:01.350 --> 03:07:05.310
<v Speaker 1>and even adjust jeff novitsky thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the Stuff that we see in these</v>

4267
03:07:05.311 --> 03:07:10.311
<v Speaker 1>stores like gnc and health stores that</v>
<v Speaker 1>have these muscle building things,</v>

4268
03:07:10.830 --> 03:07:13.290
<v Speaker 1>a lot of those things are really</v>
<v Speaker 1>steroids really now.</v>

4269
03:07:13.350 --> 03:07:14.183
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4270
03:07:14.750 --> 03:07:16.880
<v Speaker 1>Form like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

4271
03:07:17.290 --> 03:07:21.150
<v Speaker 1>you guys keep pissing hot from the usada</v>
<v Speaker 1>has a website that we,</v>

4272
03:07:21.210 --> 03:07:24.300
<v Speaker 1>when novitsky was here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he sent us to the website and you go</v>

4273
03:07:24.301 --> 03:07:28.050
<v Speaker 1>like a through z,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you find whatever the supplement is and</v>

4274
03:07:28.051 --> 03:07:31.060
<v Speaker 1>you list to see if whether or not people</v>
<v Speaker 1>have been popped for it,</v>

4275
03:07:31.360 --> 03:07:34.320
<v Speaker 1>like they test and and they pull these</v>
<v Speaker 1>things off the market and they just come</v>

4276
03:07:34.321 --> 03:07:35.850
<v Speaker 1>back with some new name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They switch.</v>

4277
03:07:37.130 --> 03:07:39.480
<v Speaker 1>Remember mark maguire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stuff he was using,</v>

4278
03:07:39.481 --> 03:07:41.130
<v Speaker 1>you could buy at jet style.</v>

4279
03:07:42.340 --> 03:07:44.320
<v Speaker 1>I took that shit that you get by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4280
03:07:45.310 --> 03:07:47.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well sort of as a steroid precursor</v>

4281
03:07:47.701 --> 03:07:49.920
<v Speaker 1>hormone precursor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but here's the deal.</v>

4282
03:07:50.700 --> 03:07:55.700
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't thinking that he's holding his</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking whatever.</v>

4283
03:07:55.831 --> 03:07:59.190
<v Speaker 1>Even think he was taking that for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck of it.</v>

4284
03:07:59.220 --> 03:08:03.330
<v Speaker 1>Just to see how he fell maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was injecting straight to this,</v>

4285
03:08:04.590 --> 03:08:08.060
<v Speaker 1>that anderson and worked a little but he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>

4286
03:08:08.510 --> 03:08:11.990
<v Speaker 1>He was on the is that you see how like</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

4287
03:08:12.030 --> 03:08:13.910
<v Speaker 1>it's been a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been a less than me where I looked</v>

4288
03:08:13.911 --> 03:08:16.660
<v Speaker 1>back and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I realized when you play sports in the</v>

4289
03:08:16.730 --> 03:08:20.580
<v Speaker 1>weights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody's 240 pounds in just that jack.</v>

4290
03:08:20.610 --> 03:08:24.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean some people have a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>professionals you don't do.</v>

4291
03:08:24.390 --> 03:08:26.490
<v Speaker 1>You don't go from being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true,</v>

4292
03:08:26.520 --> 03:08:31.190
<v Speaker 1>but you don't want me one 85 when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>25 and then the big dramatic difference,</v>

4293
03:08:31.220 --> 03:08:32.840
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're like a veteran.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4294
03:08:32.841 --> 03:08:34.590
<v Speaker 1>something's up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of freaks.</v>

4295
03:08:34.590 --> 03:08:39.030
<v Speaker 1>You can achieve some incredible results</v>
<v Speaker 1>with discipline and the right protocol</v>

4296
03:08:39.031 --> 03:08:42.090
<v Speaker 1>with hypertrophy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could eat a lot of food all day</v>

4297
03:08:42.091 --> 03:08:44.370
<v Speaker 1>long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lift crazy weights and when you're</v>

4298
03:08:44.371 --> 03:08:46.800
<v Speaker 1>young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if your body holds up to the workload,</v>

4299
03:08:46.950 --> 03:08:49.200
<v Speaker 1>you can put on some massive weight when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're young,</v>

4300
03:08:49.201 --> 03:08:51.120
<v Speaker 1>when your hormones are strong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you do it the right way,</v>

4301
03:08:51.121 --> 03:08:54.060
<v Speaker 1>like say if you had like a strength</v>
<v Speaker 1>lifting coach and you said,</v>

4302
03:08:54.061 --> 03:08:56.520
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to gain 20 pounds of muscle.</v>

4303
03:08:56.521 --> 03:08:58.010
<v Speaker 1>If you had to do it right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would go,</v>

4304
03:08:58.020 --> 03:08:59.250
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got to fuck with your hormones.</v>

4305
03:08:59.670 --> 03:09:03.070
<v Speaker 1>Like you're too old at this point that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you want,</v>

4306
03:09:03.780 --> 03:09:08.780
<v Speaker 1>but if you were 20 and you did the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing to your body type,</v>

4307
03:09:09.450 --> 03:09:11.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't really think I could do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4308
03:09:11.200 --> 03:09:13.830
<v Speaker 1>it's hard for me to put on any muscle</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe.</v>

4309
03:09:13.890 --> 03:09:17.100
<v Speaker 1>But You're not a guy who's ever tried</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you don't really know if your</v>

4310
03:09:18.120 --> 03:09:18.953

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4330
03:10:06.730 --> 03:10:10.870
<v Speaker 1>one of the things about [inaudible] is</v>
<v Speaker 1>interview with tim ferriss.</v>

4331
03:10:10.871 --> 03:10:14.560
<v Speaker 1>He was talking about his dad getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in power lifting when he was in</v>

4332
03:10:14.561 --> 03:10:19.210
<v Speaker 1>his sixties is he taught his dad power</v>
<v Speaker 1>lifting was dad was in his sixties and</v>

4333
03:10:19.211 --> 03:10:22.690
<v Speaker 1>like six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven years later he put on x amount of</v>

4334
03:10:22.691 --> 03:10:25.980
<v Speaker 1>pounds of muscle and he said he looks</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a 40 year old man now from like if</v>

4335
03:10:25.990 --> 03:10:27.520
<v Speaker 1>you see his back and he did.</v>

4336
03:10:28.330 --> 03:10:31.240
<v Speaker 1>I think if you did leave my skeptical</v>
<v Speaker 1>hippo.</v>

4337
03:10:33.340 --> 03:10:34.580
<v Speaker 1>Hippo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know about skeptical,</v>

4338
03:10:34.930 --> 03:10:36.250
<v Speaker 1>skeptical hippo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>

4339
03:10:36.251 --> 03:10:37.170

<v Speaker 1>Powerlifting is good.</v>

4342
03:10:44.020 --> 03:10:45.910
<v Speaker 1>If you do it right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's probably good for your</v>

4343
03:10:45.911 --> 03:10:48.760
<v Speaker 1>hormones and good for your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I feel good when I lift heavy,</v>

4344
03:10:49.000 --> 03:10:51.780
<v Speaker 1>like I have more energy that releases</v>
<v Speaker 1>testosterone.</v>

4347
03:10:53.561 --> 03:10:57.610
<v Speaker 1>with pavel things</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you told me that six year old put</v>

4350
03:11:01.890 --> 03:11:05.800
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen from the more skeptical</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was talking about with ferris was</v>

4351
03:11:05.801 --> 03:11:08.500
<v Speaker 1>talking about or pavel was talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>rather was his protocol,</v>

4352
03:11:08.650 --> 03:11:12.820
<v Speaker 1>which is that never more than five</v>
<v Speaker 1>repetitions and never go to failure.</v>

4353
03:11:13.200 --> 03:11:13.470
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

4354
03:11:13.470 --> 03:11:14.051
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4355
03:11:14.051 --> 03:11:18.340
<v Speaker 1>his ideas that if you say if you lift</v>
<v Speaker 1>something and like the most reps you can</v>

4356
03:11:18.341 --> 03:11:21.760
<v Speaker 1>do is like seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cut it off at five and and put it down</v>

4357
03:11:21.790 --> 03:11:25.390
<v Speaker 1>and that strength is a skill and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want what he calls the greasing the</v>

4358
03:11:25.391 --> 03:11:27.220
<v Speaker 1>groove,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like doing something over and over</v>

4359
03:11:27.221 --> 03:11:29.050
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>giving yourself plenty of time in</v>

4360
03:11:29.051 --> 03:11:30.550
<v Speaker 1>between it so that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're strong,</v>

4361
03:11:30.551 --> 03:11:33.670

<v Speaker 1>stronger and you'll get stronger fast.</v>

<v Speaker 1>cleans and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then later that night I'll do like clean</v>

4391
03:12:44.801 --> 03:12:47.830
<v Speaker 1>squat press.</v>

4392
03:12:47.831 --> 03:12:52.520
<v Speaker 1>I'll do my psets throughout the daylight</v>
<v Speaker 1>that split it instead of smashing it in,</v>

4393
03:12:52.820 --> 03:12:57.820
<v Speaker 1>but my cardio I still do in one big set,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what I do like to do for cardio is I</v>

4394
03:12:58.071 --> 03:13:01.040
<v Speaker 1>like to lift weights first and get</v>
<v Speaker 1>really fucking tired.</v>

4395
03:13:01.340 --> 03:13:05.210
<v Speaker 1>Then once I'm really tired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do like balls out cardio for a half</v>

4396
03:13:05.210 --> 03:13:10.210
<v Speaker 1>hour already exhausted and then I feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more of a mental thing for me is my</v>

4397
03:13:11.871 --> 03:13:13.070
<v Speaker 1>cardio and that's great.</v>

4398
03:13:13.730 --> 03:13:14.290
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

4399
03:13:14.290 --> 03:13:17.090
<v Speaker 1>I've been doing get my cardio in with my</v>
<v Speaker 1>lifting,</v>

4400
03:13:17.091 --> 03:13:21.770
<v Speaker 1>so I'll do like heavy deadlifts and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>set is whatever set of 10 of heavy</v>

4401
03:13:21.771 --> 03:13:23.600
<v Speaker 1>deadlifts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go straight from there to the</v>

4402
03:13:23.601 --> 03:13:25.970
<v Speaker 1>treadmill and I'll sprint as fast I can</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a minute.</v>

4403
03:13:26.300 --> 03:13:27.920
<v Speaker 1>Unlike level 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>11,</v>

4404
03:13:27.921 --> 03:13:29.990
<v Speaker 1>12,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just literally as fast as I can and I go</v>

4405
03:13:29.991 --> 03:13:32.680
<v Speaker 1>to pull ups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do that for five heavy debt.</v>

4406
03:13:32.690 --> 03:13:34.880
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three 15.</v>

4407
03:13:34.910 --> 03:13:38.510
<v Speaker 1>If I'm doing 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot because you do five rounds.</v>

4408
03:13:39.250 --> 03:13:40.083
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the</v>

4409
03:13:41.420 --> 03:13:45.770
<v Speaker 1>deadly heavy dead lifts for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cardio was me the fun for me.</v>

4410
03:13:45.771 --> 03:13:48.140
<v Speaker 1>I do the cross bar where I stand in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>middle of it,</v>

4411
03:13:48.180 --> 03:13:49.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I do deadlift with that,</v>

4412
03:13:50.140 --> 03:13:50.931
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that to me,</v>

4413
03:13:50.931 --> 03:13:53.030
<v Speaker 1>is that what I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my always my go to,</v>

4414
03:13:53.240 --> 03:13:58.100
<v Speaker 1>they say specifically that bar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like using that trap bar for deadlIfts</v>

4415
03:13:58.130 --> 03:14:03.130
<v Speaker 1>is one of the best ways to like excite</v>
<v Speaker 1>your entire system safest to one of the</v>

4416
03:14:03.261 --> 03:14:06.170
<v Speaker 1>safest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also like you're gripping it</v>

4417
03:14:06.230 --> 03:14:07.010
<v Speaker 1>the way you're gripping it.</v>

4418
03:14:07.010 --> 03:14:09.890
<v Speaker 1>Like there's something weird about that</v>
<v Speaker 1>over under grip that you do with a</v>

4419
03:14:09.900 --> 03:14:12.830
<v Speaker 1>standard dumbbell and then you bang it</v>
<v Speaker 1>off your shins and straighten your</v>

4420
03:14:12.860 --> 03:14:15.230
<v Speaker 1>backup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this motherfucker is like right in</v>

4421
03:14:15.231 --> 03:14:17.540
<v Speaker 1>the group so you could have really</v>
<v Speaker 1>excellent posture,</v>

4422
03:14:17.570 --> 03:14:21.950
<v Speaker 1>puts less of a load on your lower back</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you could really fucking stack up</v>

4423
03:14:21.951 --> 03:14:24.030
<v Speaker 1>with some heavy weight.</v>
