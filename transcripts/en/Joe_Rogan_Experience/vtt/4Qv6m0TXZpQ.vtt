00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:02.890
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

3
00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:08.230
<v Speaker 1>but you've also been real open about steroids in which I think is very</v>

4
00:00:08.231 --> 00:00:11.680
<v Speaker 1>commendable because it's one of those things in the world of power lifting the</v>

5
00:00:11.681 --> 00:00:13.960
<v Speaker 1>world of bodybuilding and even in the world of fighting,</v>

6
00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:15.310
<v Speaker 1>it's a dirty,</v>

7
00:00:15.311 --> 00:00:18.460
<v Speaker 1>dark secret that people like to keep to themselves.</v>

8
00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:19.840
<v Speaker 2>But your grandpa can take it.</v>

9
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

10
00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:21.551
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

11
00:00:21.551 --> 00:00:21.940
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

12
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:22.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

13

<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

14
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.950
<v Speaker 2>I believe in my,</v>

15
00:00:23.951 --> 00:00:24.790
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion,</v>

16
00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:25.481
<v Speaker 2>there should be,</v>

17
00:00:25.481 --> 00:00:26.620
<v Speaker 2>you should pass the physical.</v>

18
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.080
<v Speaker 2>No one has the right to tell you what to do in this world.</v>

19
00:00:29.081 --> 00:00:29.560
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

20
00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.400
<v Speaker 2>when it comes time to die on the one that's got a die so much time for me to</v>

21
00:00:33.401 --> 00:00:33.641
<v Speaker 2>live,</v>

22
00:00:33.641 --> 00:00:35.170
<v Speaker 2>let me lead the life I want to live.</v>

23
00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.060
<v Speaker 1>But what do you think in terms of the,</v>

24
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.240
<v Speaker 1>the problem with a lot of people have the problem,</v>

25
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.640
<v Speaker 1>the problem they see with using steroids in sports is it's going to force young</v>

26
00:00:46.641 --> 00:00:49.520
<v Speaker 1>people to use steroids to be able to compete with the people that are using</v>

27
00:00:49.521 --> 00:00:50.000
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

28
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.130
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

29
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.331
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

30
00:00:50.331 --> 00:00:51.164
<v Speaker 1>Anyhow.</v>

31
00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.093
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

32
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.670
<v Speaker 1>But if everybody's forced to be cleaned and they don't like what we're doing now</v>

33
00:00:55.671 --> 00:00:56.361
<v Speaker 1>with the UFC,</v>

34
00:00:56.361 --> 00:00:57.770
<v Speaker 1>you were like the Usada,</v>

35
00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.360
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

36
00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.560
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

37
00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.660
<v Speaker 1>the people that have stepped in,</v>

38
00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.370
<v Speaker 1>Jeff Novitsky running that program,</v>

39
00:01:01.371 --> 00:01:03.320
<v Speaker 1>the guy who caught Lance Armstrong,</v>

40
00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.540
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

41
00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.310
<v Speaker 2>actually Lance Armstrong was never caught,</v>

42
00:01:06.311 --> 00:01:06.600
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

43
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.980
<v Speaker 2>Hey Pat,</v>

44
00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:07.570
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

45
00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.080
<v Speaker 2>He passed 25 tests for seven years in a row and never was tested.</v>

46
00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:11.501
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

47
00:01:11.501 --> 00:01:13.060
<v Speaker 2>it's not against the rules to take drugs.</v>

48
00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.640
<v Speaker 2>It's against the rules and get caught taking drugs.</v>

49
00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:17.263
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

50
00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.150
<v Speaker 1>that's a fucking loophole.</v>

51
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.160
<v Speaker 2>You've got a good doctor.</v>

52
00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:22.270
<v Speaker 2>You're on the craft,</v>

53
00:01:22.271 --> 00:01:22.631
<v Speaker 2>but not,</v>

54
00:01:22.631 --> 00:01:23.290
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>

55
00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:24.590
<v Speaker 2>So that's why there should be no,</v>

56
00:01:24.591 --> 00:01:25.120
<v Speaker 2>do you know,</v>

57
00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.580
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

58
00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.330
<v Speaker 2>tie should period said make it an even playing field.</v>

59
00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.470
<v Speaker 2>Stopped the drug test.</v>

60
00:01:29.471 --> 00:01:32.710
<v Speaker 2>I'd say the same thing and we're not all born was seeing my testosterone.</v>

61
00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:33.370
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

62
00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.641
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

63
00:01:33.641 --> 00:01:34.474
<v Speaker 2>when I was a kid,</v>

64
00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:36.580
<v Speaker 2>if I was born today,</v>

65
00:01:36.581 --> 00:01:37.600
<v Speaker 2>I would be in prison.</v>

66
00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.910
<v Speaker 2>You're not telling me I teach all these,</v>

67
00:01:40.911 --> 00:01:41.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

68
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.790
<v Speaker 2>some of those fighters have got way more testosterone.</v>

69
00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:44.910
<v Speaker 2>Did another fighter that's true.</v>

70
00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:45.360
<v Speaker 2>Not born.</v>

71
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.193
<v Speaker 2>Same amount.</v>

72
00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:47.410
<v Speaker 2>So the only thing you could,</v>

73
00:01:47.411 --> 00:01:48.040
<v Speaker 2>why not for,</v>

74
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

75
00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.671
<v Speaker 2>train.</v>

76
00:01:48.671 --> 00:01:49.504
<v Speaker 2>You've got a better,</v>

77
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:50.500
<v Speaker 2>if you've got a better,</v>

78
00:01:50.501 --> 00:01:50.800
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

79
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.400
<v Speaker 2>you know you could kick my ass because you do Jujitsu and shit and I don't do</v>

80
00:01:54.401 --> 00:01:54.880
<v Speaker 2>any,</v>

81
00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.200
<v Speaker 2>but that don't mean you're tougher than me.</v>

82
00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.970
<v Speaker 2>I just mean you had a better coach in me.</v>

83
00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:59.710
<v Speaker 2>So are you cheating me?</v>

84
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.233
<v Speaker 1>That's a good point.</v>

85
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.560
<v Speaker 1>But if two guys do have the same coaches and they do have similar body types,</v>

86
00:02:07.301 --> 00:02:09.040
<v Speaker 1>and one guy's taking steroids,</v>

87
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.390
<v Speaker 1>he's going to have an advantage,</v>

88
00:02:10.391 --> 00:02:10.710
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

89
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.450
<v Speaker 2>But isn't it pharmaceutical?</v>

90
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.020
<v Speaker 2>What are you looking at your watch TV every five minutes you got a drug</v>

91
00:02:16.021 --> 00:02:16.854
<v Speaker 2>commercial one,</v>

92
00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:17.130
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

93
00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.130
<v Speaker 2>Every year I'll be 69 and let's take all the,</v>

94
00:02:20.131 --> 00:02:20.370
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

95
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm 68 I'll be 600 to almost take all the health medication of 68 year old.</v>

96
00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.760
<v Speaker 2>I'd be the only one left on her.</v>

97
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.140
<v Speaker 2>I don't have any ailment.</v>

98
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.620
<v Speaker 2>Common will tell you my problem is they go to the doctor does note that Romy,</v>

99
00:02:31.621 --> 00:02:32.454
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing wrong with me.</v>

100
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.830
<v Speaker 2>I had to beat the crap out of myself physically.</v>

101
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't have high blood pressure and cholesterol,</v>

102
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:38.700
<v Speaker 2>I don't have anything.</v>

103
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.100
<v Speaker 2>And so let's just take all the drugs away.</v>

104
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.560
<v Speaker 2>But all the old 68 year old guys die off as permanent.</v>

105
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.581
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

106
00:02:44.581 --> 00:02:46.190
<v Speaker 2>it'd be the only one lip for garlic.</v>

107
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.033
<v Speaker 2>All the old women.</v>

108
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.133
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

109
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.860
<v Speaker 1>Well for a guy like you who's not competing and Z,</v>

110
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.800
<v Speaker 1>one of the arguments for fighting is that steroids allow you to do more damage</v>

111
00:02:57.801 --> 00:02:58.634
<v Speaker 1>to your opponent.</v>

112
00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.210
<v Speaker 1>And that is one of the reasons why,</v>

113
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.451
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

114
00:03:01.451 --> 00:03:04.900
<v Speaker 1>steroids should be illegal is because you can train harder,</v>

115
00:03:04.901 --> 00:03:06.700
<v Speaker 1>you have more endurance and not just steroids,</v>

116
00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:09.040
<v Speaker 1>but things like EPO and bunch of other stuff.</v>

117
00:03:09.041 --> 00:03:10.590
<v Speaker 1>You'll have more energy in a fight.</v>

118
00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.490
<v Speaker 1>You could possibly land more blows,</v>

119
00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.200
<v Speaker 1>possibly wind up beating someone that you wouldn't be able to beat and do damage</v>

120
00:03:17.201 --> 00:03:17.501
<v Speaker 1>to them.</v>

121
00:03:17.501 --> 00:03:19.180
<v Speaker 1>So it's different in a lot of ways.</v>

122
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:20.310
<v Speaker 2>Or why,</v>

123
00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.230
<v Speaker 2>why wouldn't person take us force for him?</v>

124
00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.680
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

125
00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.530
<v Speaker 2>it's called PE,</v>

126
00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.830
<v Speaker 2>these performance enhancing drugs.</v>

127
00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.540
<v Speaker 2>Why wouldn't you do that in sport?</v>

128
00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.510
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

129
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.900
<v Speaker 2>it's because they would think of it as cheating.</v>

130
00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.171
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

131
00:03:31.171 --> 00:03:32.004
<v Speaker 2>who does?</v>

132
00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.581
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

133
00:03:32.581 --> 00:03:35.310
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people don't know how many guys are cry their eyes out,</v>

134
00:03:35.311 --> 00:03:36.144
<v Speaker 2>but you get caught.</v>

135
00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.380
<v Speaker 2>Then it cried like bitches.</v>

136
00:03:37.381 --> 00:03:38.214
<v Speaker 2>And they lie.</v>

137
00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.700
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

138
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:39.570
<v Speaker 2>Baseball players,</v>

139
00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:40.171
<v Speaker 2>they don't,</v>

140
00:03:40.171 --> 00:03:40.951
<v Speaker 2>they never took drugs.</v>

141
00:03:40.951 --> 00:03:42.450
<v Speaker 2>You get caught in a cry like bitches.</v>

142
00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.780
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

143
00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:43.650
<v Speaker 2>That's what I don't like.</v>

144
00:03:43.651 --> 00:03:44.460
<v Speaker 2>Just tell him.</v>

145
00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.760
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

146
00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:45.361
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you,</v>

147
00:03:45.361 --> 00:03:46.440
<v Speaker 2>I'll never read the Bible,</v>

148
00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.750
<v Speaker 2>but I see the billboards on the freeway says,</v>

149
00:03:48.751 --> 00:03:49.800
<v Speaker 2>I shall not lie.</v>

150
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.340
<v Speaker 2>Just quit line and come out and say,</v>

151
00:03:53.341 --> 00:03:54.180
<v Speaker 2>I take droids,</v>

152
00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.601
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

153
00:03:54.601 --> 00:03:55.434
<v Speaker 2>the NFL.</v>

154
00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.970
<v Speaker 2>Why would you be on as far as like the NFL,</v>

155
00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.770
<v Speaker 2>you know what drugs do is for recovery.</v>

156
00:03:59.200 --> 00:03:59.970
<v Speaker 2>That's all it is.</v>

157
00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:00.200
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

158
00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:00.600
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

159
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.991
<v Speaker 2>you take,</v>

160
00:04:00.991 --> 00:04:03.690
<v Speaker 2>I can give my strongest people I've ever seen,</v>

161
00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:04.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

162
00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.580

<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

164
00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.710
<v Speaker 2>I've seen we'd guys take more drugs than anyone I've ever had my gym.</v>

165
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.930
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

166
00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:09.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

167
00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:10.830
<v Speaker 2>Jugs don't make you strong.</v>

168
00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:12.300
<v Speaker 2>You're born that way.</v>

169
00:04:12.301 --> 00:04:13.111
<v Speaker 2>You're born fast.</v>

170
00:04:13.111 --> 00:04:13.980
<v Speaker 2>You're born slow.</v>

171
00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.840
<v Speaker 2>You're born with an attitude.</v>

172
00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.030
<v Speaker 2>I know you're not well,</v>

173
00:04:18.031 --> 00:04:20.040
<v Speaker 2>that's the big misconception about steroids,</v>

174
00:04:20.041 --> 00:04:20.310
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

175
00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:21.690
<v Speaker 2>Is that they make you bigger.</v>

176
00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.040
<v Speaker 2>The work makes you bigger,</v>

177
00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.130
<v Speaker 2>is to recovery,</v>

178
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.570
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

179
00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:25.890
<v Speaker 2>Cause you to recover.</v>

180
00:04:25.891 --> 00:04:29.400
<v Speaker 2>To do more workouts so everyone doesn't want to do workouts.</v>

181
00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.020
<v Speaker 2>Did the people you know,</v>

182
00:04:31.021 --> 00:04:32.700
<v Speaker 2>say they want to be an MMA fighter,</v>

183
00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:33.151
<v Speaker 2>intimidate,</v>

184
00:04:33.151 --> 00:04:34.350
<v Speaker 2>get in a cage one time?</v>

185
00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:35.520
<v Speaker 2>They never get,</v>

186
00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:36.360
<v Speaker 2>but Coleman told me,</v>

187
00:04:36.361 --> 00:04:39.450
<v Speaker 2>mark said he had a million restaurants when he had hammer house here.</v>

188
00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:40.920
<v Speaker 2>Soon as they got our bar one time,</v>

189
00:04:40.921 --> 00:04:41.910
<v Speaker 2>but he never came back.</v>

190
00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:43.333
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

191
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.833
<v Speaker 2>But there's,</v>

192
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.430
<v Speaker 1>there's a mile benefit to taking testosterone,</v>

193
00:04:47.431 --> 00:04:49.950
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of other stuff without doing any physical work.</v>

194
00:04:49.951 --> 00:04:52.730
<v Speaker 1>But almost all of it is in the fact that you could put in more work or</v>

195
00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:55.220
<v Speaker 2>work and you recover far quicker than the average person.</v>

196
00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.241
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

197
00:04:56.241 --> 00:04:57.770
<v Speaker 2>But see that way if everyone took it,</v>

198
00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:58.693
<v Speaker 2>you're not cheating.</v>

199
00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:59.330
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

200
00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.780
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>

201
00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:00.613
<v Speaker 2>you gotta you got,</v>

202
00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:01.663
<v Speaker 2>you got a corvette,</v>

203
00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:03.400
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to put high test cas in.</v>

204
00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:04.620
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

205
00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.610
<v Speaker 2>But don't you think that like it also,</v>

206
00:05:07.611 --> 00:05:08.480
<v Speaker 2>but for young guys,</v>

207
00:05:08.481 --> 00:05:11.420
<v Speaker 2>he can fuck up your endocrine system and fucks up your body's production</v>

208
00:05:11.421 --> 00:05:12.290
<v Speaker 2>testosterone.</v>

209
00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:13.753
<v Speaker 2>So what?</v>

210
00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.850
<v Speaker 2>So that's what hcg sport,</v>

211
00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:17.890
<v Speaker 2>you got to spark donkey.</v>

212
00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:18.430

214
00:05:22.491 --> 00:05:23.031
<v Speaker 2>take tests,</v>

215
00:05:23.031 --> 00:05:25.910
<v Speaker 2>you're taking more than mother nature told you so you're not shrink up.</v>

216
00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.390
<v Speaker 2>But there are morons anyhow because you took Casey cheat your nuts wouldn't</v>

217
00:05:29.391 --> 00:05:31.310
<v Speaker 2>drink up hcg.</v>

218
00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:32.091
<v Speaker 2>What does that stand for?</v>

219
00:05:32.091 --> 00:05:32.930
<v Speaker 2>Any trophic hormone?</v>

220
00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:37.550
<v Speaker 2>It raises all your home meant vendors and sports there you cannot,</v>

221
00:05:37.551 --> 00:05:39.740
<v Speaker 2>there's no sportsmanship and sports.</v>

222
00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.830
<v Speaker 2>It mean you was to fight in front of a big crowd.</v>

223
00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.500
<v Speaker 2>Half the crowd would want me to knock you out and the other half the crowd,</v>

224
00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:47.570
<v Speaker 2>we want you to knock me out.</v>

225
00:05:47.571 --> 00:05:48.470
<v Speaker 2>Does that sportsmanship?</v>

226
00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:51.200
<v Speaker 2>Well that's just people.</v>

227
00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean but,</v>

228
00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:55.370
<v Speaker 2>but that sportsmanship is supposed to be the athletes competing without</v>

229
00:05:55.371 --> 00:05:56.090
<v Speaker 2>cheating.</v>

230
00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:56.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean if I,</v>

231
00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:57.350
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

232
00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:58.100
<v Speaker 2>if there was a pill</v>

233
00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.840
<v Speaker 1>that you can take that made you invulnerable,</v>

234
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.990
<v Speaker 1>gave you like a God pill and you took and you went into a fight and the other</v>

235
00:06:02.991 --> 00:06:04.160
<v Speaker 1>guy thought he was fighting a man,</v>

236
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:04.610
<v Speaker 1>but you're,</v>

237
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:05.700
<v Speaker 1>you're invulnerable,</v>

238
00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:06.573
<v Speaker 1>no one can hurt you.</v>

239
00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:10.430
<v Speaker 1>You can't be hurt and you don't get tired of superhuman strength,</v>

240
00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:13.010
<v Speaker 1>which show Roy still be legal or illegal point.</v>

241
00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:13.910
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

242
00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:15.440
<v Speaker 1>it would be better than steroids.</v>

243
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.390
<v Speaker 1>It would be like a superstar.</v>

244
00:06:17.391 --> 00:06:18.081
<v Speaker 1>Roid but I mean,</v>

245
00:06:18.081 --> 00:06:19.580
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't you think that that would be cheating?</v>

246
00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:20.300
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

247
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:20.930
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

248
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:21.350
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

249
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:22.820
<v Speaker 1>but we'll then nobody can beat old buddy.</v>

250
00:06:22.821 --> 00:06:25.640
<v Speaker 1>You just beat the fuck out of each other and nothing would ever happen to hills</v>

251
00:06:25.641 --> 00:06:26.450
<v Speaker 1>right here.</v>

252
00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:27.680
<v Speaker 1>It all starts up in your brain,</v>

253
00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:28.521
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

254
00:06:28.521 --> 00:06:28.731
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

255
00:06:28.731 --> 00:06:32.600
<v Speaker 1>I kind of could see how you can make that argument with other sports.</v>

256
00:06:32.601 --> 00:06:33.590
<v Speaker 1>But with fighting,</v>

257
00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:35.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean fighting is about,</v>

258
00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:39.830
<v Speaker 1>is fighting is problem solving with dire physical consequences.</v>

259
00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:40.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's what it is.</v>

260
00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:44.660
<v Speaker 1>And if you can minimize those consequences through drugs,</v>

261
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.760
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people would think that that would be cheating.</v>

262
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:48.650
<v Speaker 1>I look at like this,</v>

263
00:06:48.651 --> 00:06:49.970
<v Speaker 1>I look at the Diaz brothers.</v>

264
00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm guessing they got a lot of testosterone.</v>

265
00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:54.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who in the hell their dad was,</v>

266
00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:56.170
<v Speaker 1>but he must had a lot of tests.</v>

267
00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:56.750
<v Speaker 1>Testosterone.</v>

268
00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:56.931
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

269
00:06:56.931 --> 00:06:57.501
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting.</v>

270
00:06:57.501 --> 00:07:00.080
<v Speaker 1>Those guys eat Vegan and for the most part thing,</v>

271
00:07:00.081 --> 00:07:02.300
<v Speaker 1>Nate eats fish and eggs too.</v>

272
00:07:02.301 --> 00:07:03.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know if Nikki,</v>

273
00:07:03.351 --> 00:07:05.600
<v Speaker 1>it's fish he might have in the past,</v>

274
00:07:05.601 --> 00:07:06.620
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think he does anymore.</v>

275
00:07:06.621 --> 00:07:07.880
<v Speaker 1>I think he's pretty much Vegan,</v>

276
00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:13.090
<v Speaker 1>which most people that eat vegan have lower testosterone because the substrate</v>

277
00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:18.880
<v Speaker 1>for developing testosterone is fats is like a cholesterol and fats and one of</v>

278
00:07:19.491 --> 00:07:20.324
<v Speaker 1>the most important,</v>

279
00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:22.490
<v Speaker 1>it's like when people get on ketogenic diets.</v>

280
00:07:22.491 --> 00:07:25.340
<v Speaker 1>One of the more interesting things that happens when they consume a large amount</v>

281
00:07:25.341 --> 00:07:29.510
<v Speaker 1>of fats and saturated fats and cholesterol is that their testosterone goes way</v>

282
00:07:29.511 --> 00:07:30.344
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

283
00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.990
<v Speaker 1>I should wait and that you're going high cholesterol diet.</v>

284
00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:33.920
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

285
00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:34.670
<v Speaker 1>So I don't,</v>

286
00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:37.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't necessarily know if those guys have high testosterone.</v>

287
00:07:37.071 --> 00:07:38.720
<v Speaker 1>What they do have is high endurance.</v>

288
00:07:38.721 --> 00:07:39.980
<v Speaker 1>Their endurance is through the roof.</v>

289
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:40.220
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

290
00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:42.710
<v Speaker 1>But a lot of that is because they participate in triathlons,</v>

291
00:07:42.711 --> 00:07:44.570
<v Speaker 1>a lot of endurance running and during swimming,</v>

292
00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:45.860
<v Speaker 1>biking things on those lines.</v>

293
00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:48.500
<v Speaker 1>So you still have to have,</v>

294
00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:48.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

295
00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:49.280
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

296
00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:49.930
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

297
00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:51.890
<v Speaker 1>the brain thought to go kick someone's ass.</v>

298
00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:52.490
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

299
00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:55.010
<v Speaker 1>But don't tell you think that Ronda Rousey has that brain thought to.</v>

300
00:07:55.011 --> 00:07:56.240
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't have any testosterone.</v>

301
00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:56.461
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

302
00:07:56.461 --> 00:07:56.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

303
00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:57.980
<v Speaker 1>she has some but not a lot.</v>

304
00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:58.521
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

305
00:07:58.521 --> 00:07:59.600
<v Speaker 1>But more than other girls.</v>

306
00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:00.201
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

307
00:08:00.201 --> 00:08:01.580
<v Speaker 1>but not more than fine work.</v>

308
00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:03.200
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a little different.</v>

309
00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.810
<v Speaker 1>See that's the argument for steroids right there.</v>

310
00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:08.510
<v Speaker 1>That's the argument because she actually has been caught,</v>

311
00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:12.050
<v Speaker 1>but she's actually tested positive and then she's passing a test now,</v>

312
00:08:12.051 --> 00:08:12.884
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

313
00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:13.551
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

314
00:08:13.551 --> 00:08:18.290
<v Speaker 1>But you know as well as I do that when a woman takes male hormones for a long</v>

315
00:08:18.291 --> 00:08:19.130
<v Speaker 1>period of time,</v>

316
00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.930
<v Speaker 1>even if they get off of them,</v>

317
00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:23.180
<v Speaker 1>there's benefits that they keep forever.</v>

318
00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:24.470
<v Speaker 1>Same thing with men.</v>

319
00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:25.400
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

320
00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.050
<v Speaker 1>And just because you're passing the drug test,</v>

321
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:28.310
<v Speaker 1>I won't say who,</v>

322
00:08:28.311 --> 00:08:30.770
<v Speaker 1>but I trained the top international shot putter.</v>

323
00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:33.440
<v Speaker 1>He could golf off hand YPAR in eight days and pass a drug test.</v>

324
00:08:33.441 --> 00:08:34.350
<v Speaker 1>IOC said,</v>

325
00:08:34.351 --> 00:08:35.060
<v Speaker 1>I will say,</v>

326
00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:35.893
<v Speaker 1>see that's it's,</v>

327
00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:37.290
<v Speaker 1>it's only eight days you can get on.</v>

328
00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:37.850
<v Speaker 1>Oh Nana.</v>

329
00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:40.020
<v Speaker 1>Is the antivirus one of the quickest ones to get off,</v>

330
00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:40.190
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

331
00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:40.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

332
00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:41.550
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>

333
00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:44.300
<v Speaker 1>and I mean how I forget to take stuff for eight days.</v>

334
00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:51.230
<v Speaker 1>So the benefits unquestionably a are permanent or at least some of them are.</v>

335
00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:52.130
<v Speaker 1>What I think about,</v>

336
00:08:52.131 --> 00:08:52.431
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

337
00:08:52.431 --> 00:08:53.211
<v Speaker 1>what you're looking at.</v>

338
00:08:53.211 --> 00:08:56.280
<v Speaker 1>You're looking at a fight career as you see it in an envelope.</v>

339
00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:58.140
<v Speaker 2>And then when that day that tough fire retires,</v>

340
00:08:58.210 --> 00:08:59.043
<v Speaker 2>you forget about them.</v>

341
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:02.250
<v Speaker 2>But what about the years later after a fighter's career,</v>

342
00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.170
<v Speaker 2>if he was on antibiotics,</v>

343
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:08.610
<v Speaker 2>he would survive the fighting years and be able to continue with his older years</v>

344
00:09:08.611 --> 00:09:09.444
<v Speaker 2>like me.</v>

345
00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:13.510
<v Speaker 1>So what you're saying is that listening?</v>

346
00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:14.060
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

347
00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:15.950
<v Speaker 1>longevity post career.</v>

348
00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:17.160
<v Speaker 1>I totally understand that.</v>

349
00:09:17.161 --> 00:09:18.590
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of fighters believe that as well.</v>

350
00:09:18.591 --> 00:09:19.970
<v Speaker 1>Like testosterone replacement,</v>

351
00:09:19.971 --> 00:09:23.240
<v Speaker 1>growth hormone therapy for guys who have retired.</v>

352
00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:25.280
<v Speaker 1>But while they're competing themselves,</v>

353
00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:27.950
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to do anything because they don't want to think that the reason</v>

354
00:09:27.951 --> 00:09:29.090
<v Speaker 1>why they accomplish those goals,</v>

355
00:09:29.091 --> 00:09:30.290
<v Speaker 1>because they were taking drugs.</v>

356
00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:35.240
<v Speaker 1>I could shoot tons of Roy's and someone's ass ain't going make them kick my ass.</v>

357
00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:37.370
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to make them kick their ass.</v>

358
00:09:37.371 --> 00:09:41.030
<v Speaker 1>But there's no question that some fighters fight better when they're taking</v>

359
00:09:41.031 --> 00:09:41.820
<v Speaker 1>steroids.</v>

360
00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:43.970
<v Speaker 1>How about just a nutritionist?</v>

361
00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:45.680
<v Speaker 1>I was just cut out the nutritionist.</v>

362
00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:46.941
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

363
00:09:46.941 --> 00:09:48.320
<v Speaker 1>but the nutritionist look,</v>

364
00:09:48.321 --> 00:09:48.560
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

365
00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:50.060
<v Speaker 1>everybody knows how to eat healthy.</v>

366
00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:50.811
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

367
00:09:50.811 --> 00:09:53.000
<v Speaker 1>if you're eating healthy and you're training hard,</v>

368
00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:55.490
<v Speaker 1>but one guy's taking steroids and one guy's not,</v>

369
00:09:55.491 --> 00:09:57.830
<v Speaker 1>there's a giant advantage for the guy was taking steroids.</v>

370
00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:00.700
<v Speaker 1>I just know too many people take steroids in any passenger.</v>

371
00:10:00.701 --> 00:10:02.210
<v Speaker 1>I guess that's all I'm trying to say.</v>

372
00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:02.601
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

373
00:10:02.601 --> 00:10:03.740
<v Speaker 1>Well that bring up any names.</v>

374
00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:05.480
<v Speaker 1>I understand and I know you're not,</v>

375
00:10:05.481 --> 00:10:09.710
<v Speaker 1>but that's one of the reasons why the UFC has instituted this incredibly</v>

376
00:10:09.711 --> 00:10:10.580
<v Speaker 1>invasive.</v>

377
00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:14.030
<v Speaker 1>You sought a policy where they don't wake you up at six 30 in the morning.</v>

378
00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:16.430
<v Speaker 1>Well l how'd you like that watch you piss in a cup.</v>

379
00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:17.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't like it exactly,</v>

380
00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:19.390
<v Speaker 1>but that's the only way to catch people.</v>

381
00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:20.283
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

382
00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:22.320
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

383
00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:22.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

384
00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:23.980
<v Speaker 2>I'll never go to drug test.</v>

385
00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:24.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't think the NFL,</v>

386
00:10:24.911 --> 00:10:25.601
<v Speaker 2>she had drug test.</v>

387
00:10:25.601 --> 00:10:26.490
<v Speaker 2>I don't think in India.</v>

388
00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:28.360
<v Speaker 1>There's a good argument there,</v>

389
00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:28.960
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

390
00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:29.441
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

391
00:10:29.441 --> 00:10:31.240
<v Speaker 1>it's a good argument for baseball because baseball,</v>

392
00:10:31.241 --> 00:10:33.280
<v Speaker 1>no one's getting hurt in the NFL.</v>

393
00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:36.700
<v Speaker 1>You can make the argument that you're able to hurt guys more and then that</v>

394
00:10:36.701 --> 00:10:38.770
<v Speaker 1>damages them and it shortens their career.</v>

395
00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:39.520
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

396
00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:40.181
<v Speaker 1>but baseball,</v>

397
00:10:40.181 --> 00:10:40.871
<v Speaker 1>there's no argument,</v>

398
00:10:40.871 --> 00:10:41.500
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>

399
00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:42.820
<v Speaker 1>baseball's boring as fuck.</v>

400
00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:43.530
<v Speaker 1>And if,</v>

401
00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:44.320
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

402
00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:45.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean some people like it,</v>

403
00:10:45.371 --> 00:10:46.000
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

404
00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.560
<v Speaker 1>But what I'm saying is like if,</v>

405
00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:48.210
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

406
00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:51.010
<v Speaker 1>if you got a drug that lets you hit more balls over the fence,</v>

407
00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:52.053
<v Speaker 1>take that.</v>

408
00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:55.400
<v Speaker 2>That's the only thing interesting about baseballs home runs.</v>

409
00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:58.470
<v Speaker 2>So how do you let that for get away with it?</v>

410
00:10:58.471 --> 00:10:59.161
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

411
00:10:59.161 --> 00:11:00.570
<v Speaker 2>Why not make it legal for all?</v>

412
00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:01.021
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

413
00:11:01.021 --> 00:11:02.580
<v Speaker 2>like baseball's a funny thing.</v>

414
00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:02.970
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

415
00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:04.290
<v Speaker 2>if he hit less than 50 home runs,</v>

416
00:11:04.291 --> 00:11:05.071
<v Speaker 2>that gets your drug free,</v>

417
00:11:05.071 --> 00:11:08.790
<v Speaker 2>but you start hitting 51 your Roy dry and seems like that's what this called.</v>

418
00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:09.810
<v Speaker 2>And he talked about the base,</v>

419
00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:10.713
<v Speaker 2>the steroid year.</v>

420
00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:13.020
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] we're taking a drug in 1960.</v>

421
00:11:13.021 --> 00:11:14.700
<v Speaker 2>So who are they trying to kid where they,</v>

422
00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:15.340
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

423
00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:16.020
<v Speaker 2>it's Saint Louis,</v>

424
00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:16.321
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

425
00:11:16.321 --> 00:11:16.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

426
00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:17.700
<v Speaker 2>as a football team,</v>

427
00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:18.360
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

428
00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:18.541
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

429
00:11:18.541 --> 00:11:19.374
<v Speaker 2>the Raiders,</v>

430
00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:19.660
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

431
00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:22.380
<v Speaker 2>I've heard stories where I think it's a document on ESPN.</v>

432
00:11:22.381 --> 00:11:25.560
<v Speaker 2>Never gone and had the ball tabs on the training table.</v>

433
00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:26.340
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

434
00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:31.340
<v Speaker 2>Well you know what I just say to the Raiders or the baseball team that the oral,</v>

435
00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:32.680
<v Speaker 2>the um,</v>

436
00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:33.350
<v Speaker 2>the A's,</v>

437
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:34.183
<v Speaker 2>the athletics.</v>

438
00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:35.423
<v Speaker 2>What was like,</v>

439
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:36.610
<v Speaker 2>if they're in the same town,</v>

440
00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:38.450
<v Speaker 2>it's like Siamese twins.</v>

441
00:11:38.451 --> 00:11:39.990
<v Speaker 2>You're having sex with one girl's room section.</v>

442
00:11:39.991 --> 00:11:40.824
<v Speaker 2>Both the girls.</v>

443
00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:42.443
<v Speaker 2>What</v>

444
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.550
<v Speaker 2>if no one tested it?</v>

445
00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:48.270
<v Speaker 2>New football players were taking it.</v>

446
00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:49.500
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

447
00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:50.050
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

448
00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:51.550
<v Speaker 2>Oakland but why was,</v>

449
00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.030
<v Speaker 2>why wouldn't the baseball player,</v>

450
00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.670
<v Speaker 2>you taken it right down the street.</v>

451
00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:55.970
<v Speaker 1>Clearly it probably would,</v>

452
00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:59.210
<v Speaker 1>but do you think that people were thinking of steroids is being like,</v>

453
00:11:59.260 --> 00:11:59.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

454
00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:02.150
<v Speaker 1>like that kind of power being a crucial aspect of baseball?</v>

455
00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:03.150
<v Speaker 2>I think what it was.</v>

456
00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:03.810
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

457
00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:05.170
<v Speaker 2>But baseball is more of a skill game.</v>

458
00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:07.320
<v Speaker 2>Did anyone ever from Mickey Mantle,</v>

459
00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:08.280
<v Speaker 2>Roger Maris,</v>

460
00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:09.413
<v Speaker 2>Hank Aaron,</v>

461
00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:11.710
<v Speaker 2>do you think Hank Aaron was doing steroids course?</v>

462
00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:13.390
<v Speaker 2>They had steroids back then.</v>

463
00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:13.680
<v Speaker 2>Pants,</v>

464
00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:14.880
<v Speaker 2>shirts 1939.</v>

465
00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:18.450
<v Speaker 2>But where Pete were athletes taking them know exactly.</v>

466
00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:19.171
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

467
00:12:19.171 --> 00:12:20.190
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm trying to say.</v>

468
00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:20.510
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

469
00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:21.990
<v Speaker 2>If the football team was taking it,</v>

470
00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:23.100
<v Speaker 2>why wouldn't the baseball,</v>

471
00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:25.110
<v Speaker 2>so we'll get these fortunate answers.</v>

472
00:12:25.111 --> 00:12:25.561
<v Speaker 2>All geeks.</v>

473
00:12:25.561 --> 00:12:25.920
<v Speaker 2>Anyhow,</v>

474
00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:27.570
<v Speaker 2>there was a god damn thing in her life.</v>

475
00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:31.590
<v Speaker 2>But there they're also a hypocritical and they got these ideas and their puppy</v>

476
00:12:31.591 --> 00:12:33.120
<v Speaker 2>on air probably taking a,</v>

477
00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:33.851
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

478
00:12:33.851 --> 00:12:34.110
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

479
00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:35.970
<v Speaker 2>testosterone therapy as it is.</v>

480
00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:37.081
<v Speaker 2>How's that?</v>

481
00:12:37.081 --> 00:12:40.800
<v Speaker 2>Apparently one time and his doctors are big fat guy and he's talking about how</v>

482
00:12:40.801 --> 00:12:42.420
<v Speaker 2>bad boy jar sub does listen to them.</v>

483
00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:43.411
<v Speaker 2>And then when,</v>

484
00:12:43.411 --> 00:12:43.831
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>

485
00:12:43.831 --> 00:12:44.760
<v Speaker 2>what's a patch on here?</v>

486
00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:45.091
<v Speaker 2>He's all,</v>

487
00:12:45.091 --> 00:12:46.200
<v Speaker 2>that's a testosterone patch.</v>

488
00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:47.413
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

489
00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:50.350
<v Speaker 1>What kind of thinking is that?</v>

490
00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:51.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's very,</v>

491
00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:52.593
<v Speaker 1>it's a true story.</v>

492
00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:55.750
<v Speaker 1>Well there's a lot of hypocritical you when it comes to that stuff for sure.</v>

493
00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:56.490
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

494
00:12:56.490 --> 00:12:56.761
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

495
00:12:56.761 --> 00:13:00.280
<v Speaker 1>it's an interesting debate and a lot of people think that you should be able to</v>

496
00:13:00.281 --> 00:13:01.120
<v Speaker 1>do whatever you want.</v>

497
00:13:01.121 --> 00:13:04.330
<v Speaker 1>Like the pride days during the pride days,</v>

498
00:13:04.331 --> 00:13:05.290
<v Speaker 1>which in my opinion,</v>

499
00:13:05.291 --> 00:13:09.550
<v Speaker 1>where some of the most exciting all time mixed martial arts fights,</v>

500
00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:11.680
<v Speaker 1>those guys did whatever the fuck they wanted.</v>

501
00:13:11.681 --> 00:13:16.681
<v Speaker 1>And the Japanese literally told them like in their contract we will not test you</v>

502
00:13:16.751 --> 00:13:17.530
<v Speaker 1>for steroids.</v>

503
00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:19.570
<v Speaker 1>They told them that like,</v>

504
00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:20.530
<v Speaker 1>look at horse racing.</v>

505
00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:21.543
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

506
00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:21.910
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

507
00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:22.810
<v Speaker 1>Dog Racing.</v>

508
00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:23.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

509
00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:24.341
<v Speaker 1>But everybody,</v>

510
00:13:24.341 --> 00:13:24.920
<v Speaker 1>that's okay.</v>

511
00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:26.320
<v Speaker 1>So he just were worried about that.</v>

512
00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:26.640
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

513
00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:27.910
<v Speaker 1>equal poise right.</v>

514
00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:28.370
<v Speaker 1>Echo.</v>

515
00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:29.520
<v Speaker 1>Poises aqua.</v>

516
00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:31.780
<v Speaker 1>It's like got a horse in the fucking title.</v>

517
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:32.321
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

518
00:13:32.321 --> 00:13:32.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

519
00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:36.040
<v Speaker 1>and that's something that people take and it's a hormone for steroids.</v>

520
00:13:36.041 --> 00:13:36.940
<v Speaker 1>For horses.</v>

521
00:13:36.941 --> 00:13:37.774
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

522
00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:38.733
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

523
00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:42.190
<v Speaker 1>so you don't think there's anything negative.</v>

524
00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:45.460
<v Speaker 1>There's obviously gotta be some drawbacks of steroids.</v>

525
00:13:45.461 --> 00:13:46.294
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

526
00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:50.710
<v Speaker 2>I went on antibiotics in 19 January,</v>

527
00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:54.170
<v Speaker 2>1970 1970 1970 and uh,</v>

528
00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:55.750
<v Speaker 2>so it was this 2016.</v>

529
00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:56.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

530
00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:57.183
<v Speaker 2>I'd never been off.</v>

531
00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:58.940
<v Speaker 1>You never been off in 46 years.</v>

532
00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:00.230
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

533
00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:03.890
<v Speaker 1>It just stay on him.</v>

534
00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:04.580
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

535
00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:05.960
<v Speaker 1>No cycle that go off</v>

536
00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:10.040
<v Speaker 1>to tell everybody or off him.</v>

537
00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:11.193
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

538
00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:14.060
<v Speaker 2>I go out there and tell him the truth.</v>

539
00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:16.040
<v Speaker 2>I don't lie to people get upset.</v>

540
00:14:16.041 --> 00:14:17.420
<v Speaker 2>Are you that you're so honest about it?</v>

541
00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:18.860
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a damn of the upset,</v>

542
00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:22.330
<v Speaker 2>but I'm just curious and you'll never come up at the council self-respecting.</v>

543
00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:24.290
<v Speaker 2>I give him hell about these geeks.</v>

544
00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:25.520
<v Speaker 2>They're not doing crap.</v>

545
00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:27.170
<v Speaker 2>They suck when they were kids.</v>

546
00:14:27.171 --> 00:14:29.390
<v Speaker 2>They suck when you're at middle age and they suck when you're old.</v>

547
00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:36.920
<v Speaker 2>That's how I look at it.</v>

548
00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:38.181
<v Speaker 2>Our Damn prison.</v>

549
00:14:38.181 --> 00:14:38.901
<v Speaker 2>I'll be on roids.</v>

550
00:14:38.901 --> 00:14:39.640
<v Speaker 2>I'll count you bev.</v>

551
00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:39.831
<v Speaker 2>Roy,</v>

552
00:14:39.831 --> 00:14:40.491
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't be putting,</v>

553
00:14:40.491 --> 00:14:41.750
<v Speaker 2>our world would be in its shape.</v>

554
00:14:41.751 --> 00:14:42.584
<v Speaker 2>It's in the day.</v>

555
00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:44.000
<v Speaker 2>If they had some nuts,</v>

556
00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:46.390
<v Speaker 1>but if they had nuts,</v>

557
00:14:46.391 --> 00:14:47.380
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't need steroids.</v>

558
00:14:47.381 --> 00:14:47.621
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

559
00:14:47.621 --> 00:14:48.454
<v Speaker 1>Cause then</v>

560
00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:51.093
<v Speaker 2>let's just say some,</v>

561
00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:52.160
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

562
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:52.810
<v Speaker 1>Some aggression.</v>

563
00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:53.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

564
00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:57.250
<v Speaker 2>So my premise is a psychologist and he would test people in prisons,</v>

565
00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:58.700
<v Speaker 2>a rapist hammers.</v>

566
00:14:58.701 --> 00:14:59.860
<v Speaker 2>He said he had tested some,</v>

567
00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:05.090
<v Speaker 2>had 25 times the rate testosterone and normal man does 25 one time.</v>

568
00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:07.300
<v Speaker 2>That's why I say,</v>

569
00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:07.961
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

570
00:15:07.961 --> 00:15:09.040
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't even possible.</v>

571
00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.990
<v Speaker 2>Well why are they out there raping people and why they killing people with no,</v>

572
00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:14.080
<v Speaker 2>no remorse.</v>

573
00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:15.990
<v Speaker 2>Because he got an enormous amount.</v>

574
00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:17.650
<v Speaker 2>He said that he saw it.</v>

575
00:15:17.651 --> 00:15:18.760
<v Speaker 2>That's why they probably did it.</v>

576
00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:19.683
<v Speaker 2>He didn't,</v>

577
00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:20.140
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

578
00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:20.973
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

579
00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:22.630
<v Speaker 2>if you can't do that stuff,</v>

580
00:15:22.631 --> 00:15:23.231
<v Speaker 2>he realized that.</v>

581
00:15:23.231 --> 00:15:26.200
<v Speaker 2>But he thought that's why they would be on a course to do stuff like that.</v>

582
00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:27.520
<v Speaker 2>It just absolutely crazy.</v>

583
00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:28.480
<v Speaker 2>You take,</v>

584
00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:29.201
<v Speaker 2>look at elephants,</v>

585
00:15:29.201 --> 00:15:30.970
<v Speaker 2>you dug these elephants while they call,</v>

586
00:15:30.971 --> 00:15:31.720
<v Speaker 2>when they,</v>

587
00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:32.590
<v Speaker 2>they just ease.</v>

588
00:15:32.591 --> 00:15:33.550
<v Speaker 2>I'll test house in or out,</v>

589
00:15:33.551 --> 00:15:35.110
<v Speaker 2>killing each other and knock it down.</v>

590
00:15:35.111 --> 00:15:35.944
<v Speaker 2>Villagers.</v>

591
00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:37.550
<v Speaker 1>So the world needs more of that.</v>

592
00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:38.161
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

593
00:15:38.161 --> 00:15:40.350
<v Speaker 2>I think it needs more because of the kind of look at,</v>

594
00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:41.430
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

595
00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:42.270
<v Speaker 2>When I was a kid,</v>

596
00:15:42.271 --> 00:15:43.230
<v Speaker 2>just 10% gay.</v>

597
00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:44.180
<v Speaker 2>Now they say there's 34</v>

598
00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:47.990
<v Speaker 1>four 34% 4% but colleges,</v>

599
00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:51.740
<v Speaker 1>I believe it too,</v>

600
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:52.280
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

601
00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:53.113
<v Speaker 1>boy bands,</v>

602
00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:56.160
<v Speaker 1>there's no ways.</v>

603
00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:58.940
<v Speaker 1>34% 4% oh man.</v>

604
00:15:58.970 --> 00:15:59.420
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

605
00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:01.440
<v Speaker 1>well I'm sure someone probably want to test out your,</v>

606
00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:02.490
<v Speaker 1>because look at Jeffrey Dahmer.</v>

607
00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:03.350
<v Speaker 1>He's out there killing people.</v>

608
00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:04.911
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

609
00:16:04.911 --> 00:16:05.744
<v Speaker 1>he was gay too,</v>

610
00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:07.843
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think,</v>

611
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't necessarily think that's a testosterone thing.</v>

612
00:16:10.041 --> 00:16:10.281
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

613
00:16:10.281 --> 00:16:12.280
<v Speaker 1>That's a sociopath psychopath thing.</v>

614
00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:13.130
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

615
00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:13.963
<v Speaker 1>I will say that.</v>

616
00:16:14.050 --> 00:16:14.240
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

617
00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:14.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't think,</v>

618
00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:15.763
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

619
00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:17.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm not talking about the gay part,</v>

620
00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:20.320
<v Speaker 1>the other part of the eating people crazy ash.</v>

621
00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:21.673
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

622
00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:22.701
<v Speaker 1>but that's,</v>

623
00:16:22.701 --> 00:16:25.910
<v Speaker 1>but that's not a good argument for testosterone if you seen that prisoners and</v>

624
00:16:25.911 --> 00:16:27.680
<v Speaker 1>rapists and murderers have a lot of it,</v>

625
00:16:27.681 --> 00:16:28.330
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

626
00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:30.100
<v Speaker 2>but it got a lot of opinions about Roy's,</v>

627
00:16:30.101 --> 00:16:33.160
<v Speaker 2>but I've seen probably a thousand people on Roy's over the years.</v>

628
00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:33.640
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

629
00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:34.010
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

630
00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:34.721
<v Speaker 2>Dell maybe more,</v>

631
00:16:34.721 --> 00:16:34.961
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

632
00:16:34.961 --> 00:16:35.560
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

633
00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:38.620
<v Speaker 2>The ones who took the most drugs were not always the strongest.</v>

634
00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:42.370
<v Speaker 2>I can see the strong guys didn't take that much and a lot of them.</v>

635
00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:44.650
<v Speaker 2>And then the lesser guys take a ton of shit,</v>

636
00:16:44.651 --> 00:16:45.440
<v Speaker 2>but he just can't do it.</v>

637
00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:45.680
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>

638
00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:46.740
<v Speaker 1>They're just not what strong.</v>

639
00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:47.311
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

640
00:16:47.311 --> 00:16:51.540
<v Speaker 1>isn't there also a point of diminishing returns where like taking too much of it</v>

641
00:16:51.541 --> 00:16:54.290
<v Speaker 1>throws your body out of balance to the point where you're not going to recover</v>

642
00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:54.810
<v Speaker 1>correctly.</v>

643
00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:58.350
<v Speaker 1>Cause your body's constantly dealing with this and it makes you crazy.</v>

644
00:16:58.530 --> 00:16:58.960
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

645
00:16:58.960 --> 00:16:59.820
<v Speaker 1>It can't concentrate.</v>

646
00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:00.451
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

647
00:17:00.451 --> 00:17:00.841
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>

648
00:17:00.841 --> 00:17:02.880
<v Speaker 1>that's a real problem that people don't want to admit.</v>

649
00:17:02.881 --> 00:17:04.440
<v Speaker 1>The roid rage isn't a real thing.</v>

650
00:17:04.441 --> 00:17:05.061
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it.</v>

651
00:17:05.061 --> 00:17:05.551
<v Speaker 1>It's real.</v>

652
00:17:05.551 --> 00:17:06.510
<v Speaker 1>It's 100% real.</v>

653
00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:09.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's such a thing you don't think so know.</v>

654
00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:10.410
<v Speaker 1>Well you said it makes you crazy.</v>

655
00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:11.011
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

656
00:17:11.011 --> 00:17:11.910
<v Speaker 1>But I don't see the little,</v>

657
00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:12.840
<v Speaker 1>the little guys,</v>

658
00:17:12.841 --> 00:17:13.051
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

659
00:17:13.051 --> 00:17:16.590
<v Speaker 1>there's plenty of fighters would fight a 300 pound guy cause they're just crazy,</v>

660
00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:17.370
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>

661
00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:17.611
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

662
00:17:17.611 --> 00:17:18.444
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

663
00:17:18.570 --> 00:17:19.830
<v Speaker 1>enrollees are fucking crazy.</v>

664
00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:20.161
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

665
00:17:20.161 --> 00:17:24.030
<v Speaker 1>But when people are taking too much steroids and it makes you crazy,</v>

666
00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:27.320
<v Speaker 1>a little guy's not going to jump on a big guy and get his ass great.</v>

667
00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:27.670
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

668
00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:28.710
<v Speaker 1>because a roid rage,</v>

669
00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:30.150
<v Speaker 1>he'll do it because he's,</v>

670
00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:30.991
<v Speaker 1>he was born that way.</v>

671
00:17:30.991 --> 00:17:31.760
<v Speaker 1>To do it.</v>

672
00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:32.190
<v Speaker 1>You're more,</v>

673
00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:33.840
<v Speaker 1>there's two kinds of people praying predator.</v>

674
00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:35.850
<v Speaker 1>You'll find out which one you are real quick.</v>
