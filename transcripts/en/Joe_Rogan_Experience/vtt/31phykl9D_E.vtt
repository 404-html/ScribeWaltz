129
00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.430

<v Speaker 2>So I went in the studio,</v>

130
00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to make some real fucking country</v>

131
00:05:08.241 --> 00:05:11.480
<v Speaker 2>music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And at the time I didn't know what had</v>

132
00:05:11.481 --> 00:05:12.470
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

133
00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:14.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm in Nashville,</v>

134
00:05:14.481 --> 00:05:16.700
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the fuck's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

135
00:05:16.701 --> 00:05:19.910
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whenever I write a song,</v>

136
00:05:19.911 --> 00:05:21.920
<v Speaker 2>like my first instinct is just not to</v>
<v Speaker 2>censor it,</v>

137
00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would you and I started playing in</v>

<v Speaker 1>that's probably the cleanest song.</v>

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.000
<v Speaker 1>It's a funny song though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Funny,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the point I'm trying,</v>

170
00:06:32.871 --> 00:06:35.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started getting around.</v>

171
00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:37.790
<v Speaker 1>What was interesting to me was I started</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting around through,</v>

172
00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:38.661
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

173
00:06:38.661 --> 00:06:41.120
<v Speaker 1>like big promotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just people passing it on.</v>

174
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.880
<v Speaker 1>Someone would find out about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd send it to this guy and he would</v>

175
00:06:43.881 --> 00:06:45.860
<v Speaker 1>send it to his friends and that's how I</v>
<v Speaker 1>got it.</v>

176
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:47.720
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might've been stirred all the sound</v>

177
00:06:47.721 --> 00:06:48.830
<v Speaker 1>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very pop.</v>

178
00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.090
<v Speaker 1>Cause every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what had happened,</v>

179
00:06:50.091 --> 00:06:53.270
<v Speaker 1>what happened was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and kind of the main point was I was in</v>

180
00:06:53.271 --> 00:06:56.390
<v Speaker 1>the studio back to what we were talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about and I'm listening to playback to</v>

181
00:06:56.391 --> 00:06:57.200
<v Speaker 1>fuck fuck you bitch.</v>

182
00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:57.621
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

183
00:06:57.621 --> 00:06:59.780
<v Speaker 1>this is so pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I made it clean,</v>

184
00:06:59.781 --> 00:07:00.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like love you girl,</v>

185
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:01.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

186
00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.020
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this could get played on the radio.</v>

187
00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:05.540
<v Speaker 1>And they look at me like I'm crazy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go,</v>

188
00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:08.510
<v Speaker 1>this ain't getting played on the radio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

189
00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:10.820
<v Speaker 1>why not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go cause it's real country music</v>

190
00:07:10.821 --> 00:07:12.410
<v Speaker 1>and they don't play that on the radio</v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

191
00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:13.610
<v Speaker 1>Then I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's just,</v>

192
00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:15.920
<v Speaker 1>if I can get in and get banned for</v>
<v Speaker 1>playing real country,</v>

193
00:07:15.921 --> 00:07:20.360
<v Speaker 1>why not just fucking not censor myself</v>
<v Speaker 1>at all and do it fucking X.</v>

194
00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:20.811
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>

195
00:07:20.811 --> 00:07:24.830
<v Speaker 1>that's what kind of convinced me just to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it my fucking way.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>

<v Speaker 1>check the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>check it with the papers of enemies of</v>

394
00:15:14.901 --> 00:15:18.410
<v Speaker 1>does it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I wasn't the specifics.</v>

395
00:15:18.411 --> 00:15:19.640
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

396
00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:23.300
<v Speaker 1>I got a little stone and I thought this</v>
<v Speaker 1>was what happened and I should have</v>

397
00:15:23.301 --> 00:15:24.800
<v Speaker 1>asked him about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is true,</v>

398
00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:29.330
<v Speaker 1>but so he just started accusing him of</v>
<v Speaker 1>being a CIA has done to his face.</v>

399
00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:31.790
<v Speaker 1>I did it on a couple of radio shows and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>

400
00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:34.340
<v Speaker 1>and this is probably going to break it</v>
<v Speaker 1>open a little bit,</v>

401
00:15:34.341 --> 00:15:35.750
<v Speaker 1>but anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now he's,</v>

402
00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:39.200
<v Speaker 1>he won't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why will he confront me about it?</v>

403
00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:40.500
<v Speaker 1>Because it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

404
00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:43.730
<v Speaker 1>And why is this new album all about him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You heard the record.</v>

405
00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:47.420
<v Speaker 1>It just him talking to his son because</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's seeing shit at night.</v>

406
00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:48.650
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's seen the shit,</v>

407
00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:53.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do you write up an album about this?</v>

408
00:15:53.601 --> 00:15:57.740
<v Speaker 1>Serious about doing as like a serious</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk to your child because you've seen</v>

409
00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:01.400

<v Speaker 1>No one does it.</v>

411
00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:06.110

<v Speaker 1>that's not a reason to make a record.</v>

412
00:16:06.111 --> 00:16:08.810
<v Speaker 1>He says he's telling his kids warning</v>
<v Speaker 1>him don't do what I did.</v>

413
00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:12.290
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's a hired government assassin and</v>

414
00:16:12.291 --> 00:16:15.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm almost positive about this and we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the it,</v>

415
00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:17.150
<v Speaker 1>but I'm also getting the truth out</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

416
00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:19.520
<v Speaker 1>Don't you worry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to take you out for exposing</v>

417
00:16:19.521 --> 00:16:20.510
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm talking about it.</v>

418
00:16:20.511 --> 00:16:22.430
<v Speaker 1>Because now they know if he takes me</v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

419
00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:27.530
<v Speaker 1>we'll know then my story will be true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what their gut thought in Russia.</v>

420
00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:29.570
<v Speaker 1>Remember that dude in Russia?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They was talking shit about,</v>

<v Speaker 1>the Putin.</v>

423
00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:36.740
<v Speaker 1>And he thought because he was so public,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd never take them out.</v>

424
00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:40.280
<v Speaker 1>They shot him with his girlfriend while</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's with his girlfriend.</v>

425
00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:42.290
<v Speaker 1>They shot him in front of a government</v>
<v Speaker 1>building.</v>

426
00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:46.330
<v Speaker 1>Let doesn't help my fucking hang tight</v>

<v Speaker 1>why wouldn't he talk to me about it?</v>

433
00:16:58.461 --> 00:17:00.380
<v Speaker 1>Then you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>but whatever.</v>

<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

455
00:17:44.151 --> 00:17:47.180
<v Speaker 1>this is the thing though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems that</v>

456
00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:50.160
<v Speaker 1>music are a lot</v>

457
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:54.630
<v Speaker 3>like television producers in that what</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want to do is sell the most shit</v>

458
00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:58.870
<v Speaker 3>and like some of these people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not necessarily there.</v>

459
00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:01.390
<v Speaker 3>It's not that they're not artists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're definitely artists.</v>

460
00:18:01.391 --> 00:18:04.110
<v Speaker 3>They're creating music,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the creating music that they</v>

461
00:18:04.111 --> 00:18:08.070
<v Speaker 3>specifically want to sell a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want it to hit with people.</v>

462
00:18:08.071 --> 00:18:11.370
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like they want to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 3>how to press those buttons,</v>

463
00:18:11.371 --> 00:18:12.390
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

464
00:18:12.391 --> 00:18:15.930
<v Speaker 3>they want to put it in a nice juicy</v>
<v Speaker 3>formula when they get press those</v>

465
00:18:15.931 --> 00:18:16.710
<v Speaker 3>buttons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

466
00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:21.710
<v Speaker 3>And you'll sell a lot of units,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a guy like sturgeon or a guy like</v>

467
00:18:21.811 --> 00:18:24.330
<v Speaker 3>shooter jennings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like these guys are not doing that.</v>

468
00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:27.330
<v Speaker 3>What they're doing is expressing</v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves and then you get to find out</v>

469
00:18:27.331 --> 00:18:30.630
<v Speaker 3>who they actually are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's so much more interesting than</v>

470
00:18:30.631 --> 00:18:33.180
<v Speaker 3>the same canned bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the same can bullshits fine</v>

471
00:18:33.181 --> 00:18:35.490
<v Speaker 3>sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean sometimes I like listening to</v>

472
00:18:35.491 --> 00:18:38.580
<v Speaker 3>some stupid pop music song just for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck of it.</v>

473
00:18:38.581 --> 00:18:40.440
<v Speaker 3>Who Cares?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not the worst thing in the world.</v>

474
00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:41.840
<v Speaker 2>I think that's fine too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But my,</v>

475
00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:44.400
<v Speaker 2>my actual might even bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not even bigger issue,</v>

476
00:18:44.401 --> 00:18:47.640
<v Speaker 2>but speaking like I like fucking pop</v>
<v Speaker 2>music just like you,</v>

477
00:18:47.641 --> 00:18:52.110
<v Speaker 2>but the country pop his fucking 20 is 30</v>
<v Speaker 2>years is there,</v>

478
00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:54.870
<v Speaker 2>I don't mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like sturgill is a good example of</v>

479
00:18:54.871 --> 00:18:57.600
<v Speaker 2>someone who's taken country and moving</v>
<v Speaker 2>it forward.</v>

480
00:18:57.670 --> 00:18:59.760
<v Speaker 2>These guys aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're adding beats from like the</v>

481
00:18:59.761 --> 00:19:01.590
<v Speaker 2>eighties and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going backwards.</v>

482
00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:02.453
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're trying,</v>

483
00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:05.910
<v Speaker 2>I know people who go into studios of</v>
<v Speaker 2>major country artists with one of those</v>

484
00:19:05.911 --> 00:19:09.300
<v Speaker 2>fucking clickers clicker things and</v>
<v Speaker 2>making sure it's the right is not made</v>

485
00:19:09.301 --> 00:19:10.860
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Making sure it's the right beats per</v>

486
00:19:10.861 --> 00:19:11.880
<v Speaker 2>minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So slow it down,</v>

487
00:19:11.881 --> 00:19:13.440
<v Speaker 2>speed up to make sure we get on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>radio.</v>

488
00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:17.650
<v Speaker 2>So my goal with my record,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's in that fucking crazy.</v>

489
00:19:17.651 --> 00:19:20.790
<v Speaker 2>That's weird that like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's you imagine someone coming in</v>

490
00:19:20.791 --> 00:19:23.920
<v Speaker 2>here with one of those clickers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It speed up or slow down your Po,</v>

491
00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:25.410
<v Speaker 2>like you fucking kick him out of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>room.</v>

492
00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:27.410
<v Speaker 3>Well we've talked about this a hundred</v>
<v Speaker 3>times.</v>

493
00:19:27.411 --> 00:19:32.030
<v Speaker 3>Like if we actually had a network or a</v>
<v Speaker 3>producer or an executive behind the</v>

494
00:19:32.031 --> 00:19:35.000
<v Speaker 3>showed it never worked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one had never let us do any of this</v>

495
00:19:35.001 --> 00:19:36.860
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How would it had arguments with people</v>

496
00:19:36.861 --> 00:19:38.420
<v Speaker 3>every day about some of the things we</v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

497
00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:41.260
<v Speaker 2>hey tell totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why the podcast so great and</v>

498
00:19:41.261 --> 00:19:43.090
<v Speaker 2>so big and a lot of these pots,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

499
00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:47.380
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a natural reaction when like,</v>

500
00:19:47.381 --> 00:19:49.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>radio turns to shit.</v>

501
00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:51.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Podcast had to happen because people</v>

502
00:19:51.701 --> 00:19:54.640
<v Speaker 2>were sick of bullshit radio in the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing with country.</v>

503
00:19:54.641 --> 00:19:56.920
<v Speaker 2>I went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically my goal was I said,</v>

504
00:19:57.460 --> 00:19:58.810
<v Speaker 2>I gave him cash.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

505
00:19:58.811 --> 00:20:00.610
<v Speaker 2>no one's touching this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I said,</v>

506
00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:03.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to make the best country</v>
<v Speaker 2>record of the year and I'm going to make</v>

507
00:20:03.791 --> 00:20:06.880
<v Speaker 2>it completely unplayable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want it to be able to be played</v>

508
00:20:06.881 --> 00:20:08.390
<v Speaker 2>anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you're making out Mike,</v>

509
00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:12.190
<v Speaker 2>that you're literally only listening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not thinking outside the room.</v>

510
00:20:12.191 --> 00:20:16.270
<v Speaker 2>You recorded it because the assumption</v>
<v Speaker 2>was nobody was going to fucking hear it.</v>

511
00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:18.390
<v Speaker 2>So when you make an album that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>assumed,</v>

512
00:20:18.391 --> 00:20:21.490
<v Speaker 2>nobody's going to hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an interesting shit kind of</v>

513
00:20:21.491 --> 00:20:22.130
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

514
00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:23.390
<v Speaker 2>got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got fucking dirty.</v>

515
00:20:23.391 --> 00:20:25.510
<v Speaker 2>You don't get me wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it went fucking x rated,</v>

516
00:20:25.511 --> 00:20:26.800
<v Speaker 2>but it's fun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

517
00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:30.190
<v Speaker 2>It's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what you said was true to like 20</v>

518
00:20:30.191 --> 00:20:31.630
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>1510 years ago,</v>

519
00:20:31.631 --> 00:20:33.460
<v Speaker 2>this would have to be sold in the back</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a Nudie Mag.</v>

520
00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:35.470
<v Speaker 2>It's on Itunes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's on Amazon.</v>

521
00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:36.311
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

522
00:20:36.311 --> 00:20:37.040
<v Speaker 2>it's not Walmart.</v>

523
00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:40.100
<v Speaker 3>You had to give it to people and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>would have had to start talking about</v>

524
00:20:40.101 --> 00:20:42.050
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there was a few a warrant</v>

525
00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:44.920
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>few like dirty albums or guys would sink</v>

526
00:20:44.921 --> 00:20:45.540
<v Speaker 3>dirty</v>

527
00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:46.960
<v Speaker 2>his back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And David Allan Coe,</v>

528
00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:49.320
<v Speaker 2>the most famous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually opened up to shows for David</v>

529
00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:50.410
<v Speaker 2>Allen Coe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's dirty.</v>

530
00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:51.341
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

531
00:20:51.341 --> 00:20:53.590
<v Speaker 2>he's a legit country artist and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually a real story.</v>

532
00:20:53.591 --> 00:20:54.311
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

533
00:20:54.311 --> 00:20:56.710
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shel Silverstein was a,</v>

534
00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:57.910
<v Speaker 2>the writer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a country,</v>

535
00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:00.220
<v Speaker 2>you know the kids children's book</v>
<v Speaker 2>writer,</v>

536
00:21:00.221 --> 00:21:03.970
<v Speaker 2>but he also wrote country music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wrote boy named sue for Johnny Cash.</v>

537
00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:05.430
<v Speaker 2>Somebody told me that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

538
00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:06.750
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He ain't,</v>

539
00:21:06.751 --> 00:21:10.030
<v Speaker 2>he's recorded here and there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So David Allan Coe was playing these</v>

540
00:21:10.031 --> 00:21:13.030
<v Speaker 2>really dirty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these really dirty songs for Shel</v>

541
00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:13.863
<v Speaker 2>Silverstein.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>

542
00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:19.350
<v Speaker 2>you got to record this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I got a great record label.</v>

543
00:21:19.721 --> 00:21:20.470
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

544
00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:22.720
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the seventies I can't record.</v>

545
00:21:22.721 --> 00:21:23.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking</v>

546
00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:26.250
<v Speaker 2>should I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like,</v>

547
00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:31.620
<v Speaker 2>I consider myself an equal opportunity</v>
<v Speaker 2>offender and I'm a David Allan Coe fan.</v>

548
00:21:32.381 --> 00:21:33.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no disrespect,</v>

549
00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:34.270
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

550
00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:37.510
<v Speaker 2>70 he's used as for f and I don't think</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a racist because it comes up a lot.</v>

551
00:21:37.511 --> 00:21:38.410
<v Speaker 2>But he used the n word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

552
00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:43.060
<v Speaker 2>it gives crazy shit and those decks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was sold and he recorded it</v>

553
00:21:43.061 --> 00:21:46.600
<v Speaker 2>obviously off the radar and it was sold</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the back of backer mags,</v>

554
00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:49.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and those albums they got to me and</v>

555
00:21:49.211 --> 00:21:49.911
<v Speaker 2>Kentucky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

556
00:21:49.911 --> 00:21:52.980
<v Speaker 2>like they get around but it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a different machine behind him.</v>

557
00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:55.390
<v Speaker 3>Well do you remember the Jerky Boys?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

558
00:21:55.391 --> 00:21:56.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember they had a,</v>

559
00:21:56.821 --> 00:21:59.070
<v Speaker 3>there was a cassette that you would get</v>
<v Speaker 3>from people.</v>

560
00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:01.950
<v Speaker 3>That's how we all got the Jerky boys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember getting that in Kentucky.</v>

561
00:22:01.951 --> 00:22:04.500
<v Speaker 3>Just like you got to hear this part.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause we all used to do prank calls.</v>

562
00:22:04.501 --> 00:22:07.290
<v Speaker 3>Like you got to hear this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think those guys did that shit all on</v>

563
00:22:07.291 --> 00:22:08.380
<v Speaker 3>their own and put the thing,</v>

564
00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:11.790
<v Speaker 2>didn't they do a movie?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You probably won't go mainstream,</v>

565
00:22:11.791 --> 00:22:15.110
<v Speaker 2>but it went south there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>

566
00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:16.920
<v Speaker 2>but what you're saying is totally right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

567
00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:20.940
<v Speaker 2>and now you've got word of mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how you ended up on the billboard</v>

568
00:22:20.941 --> 00:22:24.120
<v Speaker 2>charts is when you got word of mouth</v>
<v Speaker 2>plus the Internet,</v>

569
00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:27.750
<v Speaker 2>which is instead of town 10 French,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're actually telling a thousand</v>

570
00:22:27.751 --> 00:22:30.480
<v Speaker 2>friends and we're outselling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

571

<v Speaker 2>Wynnona judd record and sold more copies</v>

572
00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:38.550
<v Speaker 2>and I'm from Kentucky and I got nothing</v>
<v Speaker 2>against,</v>

573
00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:40.470
<v Speaker 2>I've got nothing against the judge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way.</v>

574
00:22:40.471 --> 00:22:42.320
<v Speaker 2>Did I tell you I got in a twitter fight</v>
<v Speaker 2>with Wendona.</v>

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:03.940
<v Speaker 3>you know the big picture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's money.</v>

694
00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:07.000
<v Speaker 3>It's just like television shows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you want to watch those terrible two</v>

695
00:27:07.001 --> 00:27:10.030
<v Speaker 3>and a half men style television shows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do you think they're making those</v>

696
00:27:10.031 --> 00:27:11.410
<v Speaker 3>things?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because people are buying them.</v>

697
00:27:11.411 --> 00:27:14.050
<v Speaker 3>They're gobbling them up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a certain frequency that you can</v>

698
00:27:14.051 --> 00:27:17.200
<v Speaker 3>hit when you make like really dull,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bland stuff.</v>

699
00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:19.360
<v Speaker 3>And people like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people that like that.</v>

700
00:27:19.361 --> 00:27:20.950
<v Speaker 3>And so they know how to do it and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>bang it out.</v>

701
00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:23.980
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's what's happening with</v>
<v Speaker 3>producers,</v>

702
00:27:23.981 --> 00:27:27.130
<v Speaker 3>but it's not what the public wants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's why you're getting these</v>

703
00:27:27.131 --> 00:27:32.131
<v Speaker 3>shows like mad men or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>walking dead or you know,</v>

704
00:27:33.611 --> 00:27:35.260
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the game of thrones,</v>

705
00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:38.860
<v Speaker 3>you're getting these interesting shows</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are so much different than all</v>

706
00:27:38.861 --> 00:27:42.190
<v Speaker 3>these formulaic bullshit shows that had</v>
<v Speaker 3>been on television forever.</v>

707
00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:44.470
<v Speaker 3>And because people were changing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have to,</v>

708
00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:47.680
<v Speaker 3>they have to adapt to the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 3>people have too many options now.</v>

709
00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:50.710
<v Speaker 3>They don't have to just eat your spoon</v>
<v Speaker 3>fed bullshit.</v>

710
00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:52.230
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

711
00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:53.600
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like,</v>

712
00:27:53.601 --> 00:27:54.434
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

713
00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:56.510
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the girl who dumped me,</v>

714
00:27:57.470 --> 00:28:00.890
<v Speaker 1>and I'm telling you she's not a bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when she left my,</v>

715
00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:02.690
<v Speaker 1>and in my head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking,</v>

716
00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:05.210
<v Speaker 1>fuck as any guy would fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitch.</v>

717
00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:07.460
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do I have to cover up that emotion</v>

718
00:28:07.461 --> 00:28:10.490
<v Speaker 1>that I felt after the song for some</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking record label?</v>

719
00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:11.600
<v Speaker 1>So I just sang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>

720
00:28:11.601 --> 00:28:14.300
<v Speaker 1>But of course everyone that's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>studious guys are playing drums.</v>

721
00:28:14.301 --> 00:28:16.910
<v Speaker 1>Like what the Fuck's wrong with this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that video have on Youtube?</v>

722
00:28:16.911 --> 00:28:17.990
<v Speaker 1>It's something insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

723
00:28:17.991 --> 00:28:18.850
<v Speaker 1>it's not that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

724
00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:20.570
<v Speaker 1>we're still at the very beginnings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:24.140
<v Speaker 1>what's so crazy is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the amount of records I sold,</v>

<v Speaker 3>sense.</v>

762
00:29:39.341 --> 00:29:40.840
<v Speaker 3>But right now he's baffled.</v>

764
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:44.260

<v Speaker 1>if it makes people happy and people like</v>

765
00:29:44.261 --> 00:29:45.840
<v Speaker 1>this fucking crap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

766
00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:46.733
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

767
00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:49.190
<v Speaker 1>I liked their medallions but the fake</v>
<v Speaker 1>soldiers,</v>

768
00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:52.150
<v Speaker 1>I got nothing against it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm also the only fucking dude in</v>

769
00:29:52.151 --> 00:29:55.090
<v Speaker 1>Nashville talking shit about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about him and Sam Hunt,</v>

770
00:29:55.091 --> 00:29:58.560
<v Speaker 1>this guy who fucking wraps and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why does that guy have a dog tag on and</v>

771
00:29:58.561 --> 00:29:59.650
<v Speaker 1>go back to that please.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>

772
00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:03.580
<v Speaker 1>he's got a diamond and crusted dog tag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That should be,</v>

773
00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:07.390
<v Speaker 1>that's like some stolen valor shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he works for us.</v>

775
00:30:12.911 --> 00:30:17.050
<v Speaker 1>what a fucking dog tag is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A dog tag is aluminum and it represents</v>

776
00:30:17.051 --> 00:30:21.880
<v Speaker 1>a memory of someone who died in the war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a dog tag shaped diamond</v>

777
00:30:21.881 --> 00:30:23.590
<v Speaker 1>encrusted thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

778
00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:26.810
<v Speaker 1>this is hilarious is the real dog tags</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't diamond and crest.</v>

779
00:30:26.811 --> 00:30:28.930
<v Speaker 1>Is that what you're trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm trying to say this is the,</v>

780
00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:32.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is literally like the devil</v>
<v Speaker 1>is selling us a band.</v>

781
00:30:33.150 --> 00:30:34.300
<v Speaker 1>It really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is the thing.</v>

00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:37.360
<v Speaker 1>This is what they're selling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you wonder why I'm pissing off music</v>

<v Speaker 1>They look like they'd be wonderful to</v>
<v Speaker 1>hang out with.</v>

808
00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:41.320
<v Speaker 1>And you think those two guys know what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>locked to have loved and lost.</v>

809

<v Speaker 1>And those guys hadn't been down that</v>

<v Speaker 1>Girls are crazy.</v>

00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:57.730
<v Speaker 1>They don't even appreciate what's in</v>
<v Speaker 1>front of them.</v>

816
00:31:57.760 --> 00:31:58.810
<v Speaker 1>You want to hear that?</v>

00:32:07.181 --> 00:32:10.060
<v Speaker 1>black striped shirt is not going to give</v>
<v Speaker 1>you what you're looking for.</v>

823
00:32:10.601 --> 00:32:11.560

<v Speaker 1>I don't think he's,</v>

824
00:32:11.561 --> 00:32:14.050
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just the two dudes he</v>
<v Speaker 1>wishes he was in the cure,</v>

825
00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:15.670

<v Speaker 1>I'll bet the two guys in the front.</v>

827
00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:24.370

<v Speaker 1>I would if they become my favorite band</v>

828
00:32:24.371 --> 00:32:25.990

862
00:33:40.791 --> 00:33:42.590

<v Speaker 3>Honestly,</v>

863
00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:46.890
<v Speaker 3>it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's pop music like it's like a poppy</v>

864
00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:48.680
<v Speaker 3>poppy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

865
00:33:48.681 --> 00:33:50.840
<v Speaker 3>They're doing a lot of hip hop movements</v>
<v Speaker 3>with their hands.</v>

866
00:33:51.050 --> 00:33:52.970
<v Speaker 3>It's all like they're stealing from</v>
<v Speaker 3>black people.</v>

867
00:33:52.971 --> 00:33:55.370
<v Speaker 3>It's cultural appropriation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tony should end it.</v>

868
00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:56.780
<v Speaker 3>We should end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>

869
00:33:56.781 --> 00:33:59.690
<v Speaker 3>white people have never stopped stealing</v>
<v Speaker 3>from black people.</v>

870
00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:02.090
<v Speaker 3>They're not going to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're moving into country music.</v>

871
00:34:02.091 --> 00:34:02.924
<v Speaker 3>Was He right though?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

872
00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:03.763
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

873
00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:04.700
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

874
00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:06.920
<v Speaker 3>It's wrapped for people who are scared</v>
<v Speaker 3>of black people.</v>

875
00:34:06.921 --> 00:34:08.810
<v Speaker 3>That's 100% rav.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For people that are scared of black,</v>

876
00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:10.610
<v Speaker 3>catchy tune,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it probably sold.</v>

877
00:34:10.611 --> 00:34:13.070
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously we'll fucking more than me,</v>

878
00:34:13.071 --> 00:34:14.060
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

879
00:34:14.061 --> 00:34:17.060
<v Speaker 3>I'm the only one who's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what you were saying,</v>

880
00:34:17.061 --> 00:34:19.850
<v Speaker 3>people coming at me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which has been happening some,</v>

881
00:34:19.851 --> 00:34:22.610
<v Speaker 3>but for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't want to piss off the real</v>

882
00:34:22.611 --> 00:34:24.890
<v Speaker 3>money maker so they don't want to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>associated with that.</v>

883
00:34:25.490 --> 00:34:30.390
<v Speaker 3>It seems like there's a lot of country</v>
<v Speaker 3>music that's sort of reinforcing of</v>

884
00:34:30.391 --> 00:34:35.391
<v Speaker 3>mindset and so one of the only music</v>
<v Speaker 3>genres that reinforces a mindset and</v>

885
00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:38.180
<v Speaker 3>that mindset is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a simple person.</v>

886
00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:40.850
<v Speaker 3>I got a nice truck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got a good dog,</v>

887
00:34:40.851 --> 00:34:42.950
<v Speaker 3>I got a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but someone broke my heart.</v>

888
00:34:42.951 --> 00:34:44.900
<v Speaker 3>Or maybe I love you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe I'd die for you.</v>

889
00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:48.650
<v Speaker 3>There's like all these like really no</v>
<v Speaker 3>bull and really,</v>

890
00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:53.660
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really like iconic like country music</v>

891
00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:59.840
<v Speaker 3>themes and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a iconic country music ideas that</v>

892
00:34:59.841 --> 00:35:02.570
<v Speaker 3>get pushed in these and they just get</v>
<v Speaker 3>repeated over and over and over again.</v>

893
00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:06.560
<v Speaker 3>It's reinforcing the benefits of living</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a rural environment.</v>

894
00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:10.040
<v Speaker 3>It's reinforcing being near nature and</v>
<v Speaker 3>rivers and shit like that.</v>

895
00:35:10.041 --> 00:35:15.041
<v Speaker 3>But it's also reinforcing being dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's reinforcing like God got to have</v>

896
00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:17.420
<v Speaker 3>God involved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of God involved and</v>

897
00:35:17.421 --> 00:35:19.220
<v Speaker 3>there's some of that shit that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>listened to.</v>

898
00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:21.110
<v Speaker 3>Why go?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This can't be real.</v>

899
00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:23.810
<v Speaker 3>I don't think surgical simpson is a CIA</v>
<v Speaker 3>assassin,</v>

900
00:35:23.930 --> 00:35:26.420
<v Speaker 3>but I've listened to some country music</v>
<v Speaker 3>songs where I go,</v>

901
00:35:26.421 --> 00:35:29.270
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a fucking cyber plot.</v>

902
00:35:29.570 --> 00:35:32.030
<v Speaker 3>This is the government is trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>figure out how to get into people's</v>

903
00:35:32.031 --> 00:35:33.860
<v Speaker 3>minds and make them dumber.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

904
00:35:33.861 --> 00:35:37.200
<v Speaker 3>the other thing too is as a guy from</v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] and I'm with you 100% right,</v>

905
00:35:37.201 --> 00:35:38.300
<v Speaker 3>but seems like it totally</v>

906
00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:40.920
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it feels like it was made to brainwash.</v>

907
00:35:40.930 --> 00:35:43.080
<v Speaker 1>It's a psych psych,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psy ops.</v>

908
00:35:43.081 --> 00:35:45.840
<v Speaker 1>Is that what they call those things?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The government's just created super</v>

909
00:35:45.841 --> 00:35:49.110
<v Speaker 1>popular music that enforces the idea of</v>
<v Speaker 1>being stupid.</v>

910
00:35:49.770 --> 00:35:51.540
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But also as the guy from Kentucky,</v>

911
00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:54.390
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in Kentucky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>must my family from Tennessee and it</v>

912
00:35:54.391 --> 00:35:57.450
<v Speaker 1>makes me look like a fucking dumb ass</v>
<v Speaker 1>that like this is what people,</v>

913
00:35:57.480 --> 00:36:00.750
<v Speaker 1>this is not what the south is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a lot of really all my friends are</v>

914
00:36:00.751 --> 00:36:02.760
<v Speaker 1>from itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's great man.</v>

915
00:36:02.770 --> 00:36:03.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all the best for me.</v>

916
00:36:03.901 --> 00:36:06.060
<v Speaker 1>You know it's the fucking great</v>
<v Speaker 1>greatest,</v>

917
00:36:06.061 --> 00:36:07.740
<v Speaker 1>but you see this and that's what</v>
<v Speaker 1>reinforced,</v>

918
00:36:07.770 --> 00:36:11.100
<v Speaker 1>not only say cultural appropriation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's reinforcing stereotypes.</v>

919
00:36:11.101 --> 00:36:12.750
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going in there and making some</v>
<v Speaker 1>real,</v>

920
00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:15.510
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually would have less of a problem</v>

921
00:36:15.511 --> 00:36:17.400
<v Speaker 1>if they just didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they just called that pop music,</v>

922
00:36:17.730 --> 00:36:18.450
<v Speaker 1>it's pop music.</v>

923
00:36:18.450 --> 00:36:20.100
<v Speaker 1>Why Co?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they're given an act.</v>

924
00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:23.220
<v Speaker 1>It's pop music with an accent and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>accent is what makes it country.</v>

925
00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:25.470
<v Speaker 1>But it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't,</v>

926
00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:28.410
<v Speaker 1>there's very little bragging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like hip hop.</v>

927
00:36:28.590 --> 00:36:30.750
<v Speaker 1>Hip Hop is like a lot about bragging,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

928
00:36:30.751 --> 00:36:33.020
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

929
00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:35.430
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of what I'm going to do to</v>
<v Speaker 1>use a lot of what I own.</v>

<v Speaker 1>fucking dual blow bang guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jank you jacking each other off the 69</v>

936
00:36:51.810 --> 00:36:54.470
<v Speaker 1>spinning in a circle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the tweet that got me blocked to</v>

937
00:36:54.471 --> 00:36:55.310
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

938
00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:57.660
<v Speaker 1>that'll do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're probably not.</v>

939
00:36:57.690 --> 00:36:58.530
<v Speaker 1>They're probably nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guys.</v>

940
00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:00.290
<v Speaker 1>I heard they were nice guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it has nothing.</v>

941
00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:02.670
<v Speaker 1>And if they are listening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which they're not,</v>

942
00:37:02.970 --> 00:37:04.710
<v Speaker 1>but it's a great job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure they're happy,</v>

943
00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:06.900
<v Speaker 1>they get 7 million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's not that,</v>

944
00:37:06.901 --> 00:37:10.710
<v Speaker 1>it's not them personally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just that machine that Nashville is</v>

945
00:37:10.711 --> 00:37:15.711
<v Speaker 1>putting out that I'm so against.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I decided that it pisses me off that</v>

946
00:37:17.130 --> 00:37:20.490
<v Speaker 1>it's that country music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I love so much and I love,</v>

947
00:37:21.210 --> 00:37:22.440
<v Speaker 1>but that's not the stuff we've been</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking.</v>

948
00:37:22.441 --> 00:37:23.460
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my heroes,</v>

949
00:37:23.461 --> 00:37:26.790

<v Speaker 1>Johnny Cash and Merle just passed away</v>

950
00:37:26.791 --> 00:37:28.800
<v Speaker 1>and like the Louvin brothers just passed</v>
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

951
00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:32.610
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Louvin brothers or banner do what this</v>

952
00:37:32.611 --> 00:37:34.260
<v Speaker 1>country do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I use to love and they're singing about,</v>

953
00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:36.510
<v Speaker 1>they had to sell him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Satan is real and almost looks like a</v>

954
00:37:36.511 --> 00:37:37.980
<v Speaker 1>joke where they're sick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like,</v>

955
00:37:38.010 --> 00:37:39.540
<v Speaker 1>but they're serious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're serious.</v>

956
00:37:39.541 --> 00:37:40.760
<v Speaker 1>Satan is real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're real.</v>

957
00:37:40.890 --> 00:37:42.690
<v Speaker 1>But they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're talking about,</v>

958
00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:45.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the struggle of the devil versus like,</v>

959
00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:46.740
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting to me.</v>

960
00:37:47.130 --> 00:37:47.620
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

961
00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:49.950
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they know I'm not,</v>

962
00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:50.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

963
00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:52.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to sing sing when I sing and</v>

964
00:37:52.471 --> 00:37:53.730
<v Speaker 1>talk about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if they're talking about the</v>

965
00:37:53.731 --> 00:37:56.400
<v Speaker 1>struggle between the two sides and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I can listen,</v>

966
00:37:56.610 --> 00:37:59.880
<v Speaker 1>but if you're just talking about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is pop music.</v>

967
00:37:59.881 --> 00:38:02.670
<v Speaker 1>It's ain't country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's why I decided not to censor</v>

968
00:38:02.671 --> 00:38:04.620
<v Speaker 1>myself on the record.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like if I'm going to duke real</v>

969
00:38:04.621 --> 00:38:06.750
<v Speaker 1>country and ain't going to get played on</v>
<v Speaker 1>country radio,</v>

970
00:38:06.751 --> 00:38:08.940
<v Speaker 1>no matter what I do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter anymore though.</v>

971
00:38:08.941 --> 00:38:13.350
<v Speaker 1>It does it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean did you please check this,</v>

972
00:38:13.351 --> 00:38:15.750
<v Speaker 1>cause I'm not sure if it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of the comedy store was saying that</v>

973
00:38:15.751 --> 00:38:18.150
<v Speaker 1>CBS is unloading all of its radio</v>
<v Speaker 1>properties.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I've heard they're currently exploring</v>

975
00:38:21.481 --> 00:38:24.320
<v Speaker 1>options on what to do with their stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that it's officially how</v>

978
00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:30.840
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not nearly as good as a CD or an</v>

979
00:38:30.841 --> 00:38:31.740
<v Speaker 1>MP.</v>

<v Speaker 1>half minutes and it would be censored.</v>

984
00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:44.950
<v Speaker 1>You can't talk about the record and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would have to say traffic brought to</v>

<v Speaker 1>you by pet code.</v>

992
00:38:59.771 --> 00:39:01.570

<v Speaker 1>but also he wanted to do it himself.</v>

1038
00:40:37.650 --> 00:40:40.080
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't have nobody involved just so</v>

1039
00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:41.500
<v Speaker 1>they get it all himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really,</v>

1040
00:40:41.501 --> 00:40:42.820
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't that the same thing with your</v>

1041
00:40:42.821 --> 00:40:45.220
<v Speaker 1>pocket?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that the lesson really is if,</v>

1042
00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:49.000
<v Speaker 1>why not only do things if you're willing</v>
<v Speaker 1>to put up your own fucking money,</v>

1043
00:40:49.330 --> 00:40:51.040
<v Speaker 1>two and a half men or what you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about,</v>

1044
00:40:51.041 --> 00:40:52.660
<v Speaker 1>that kind of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck yeah.</v>

1045
00:40:52.661 --> 00:40:53.590
<v Speaker 1>Make it three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I'm,</v>

1046
00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:56.800
<v Speaker 1>if the whole thing's a bust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I s I lose zero.</v>

1047
00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:58.060
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if this is a bust,</v>

1048
00:40:58.061 --> 00:40:58.870
<v Speaker 1>I lose a lot of money.</v>

1049
00:40:58.870 --> 00:41:00.850
<v Speaker 1>You lose money if your podcast goes up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1050
00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:03.280
<v Speaker 1>it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they make it seem so easy.</v>

1051
00:41:03.490 --> 00:41:05.590
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're going to do a record with</v>
<v Speaker 1>some major label,</v>

1052
00:41:05.620 --> 00:41:06.610
<v Speaker 1>they're going to take care of</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You're going to glad hand a bunch of</v>

1056
00:41:13.001 --> 00:41:14.920
<v Speaker 1>people were really behind this record.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I listen to your stuff in the car.</v>

1059
00:41:18.071 --> 00:41:19.940
<v Speaker 1>I was crying laughing.</v>

<v Speaker 1>just total bullshit.</v>

1062
00:41:24.071 --> 00:41:26.370
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you leave and then another guy goes in,</v>

<v Speaker 1>they do the same fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't really give a fuck about you</v>

1064
00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:31.080
<v Speaker 1>hope that you'll make some money and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll kind of protect me.</v>

1065
00:41:31.110 --> 00:41:33.610

<v Speaker 2>ain't got nothing to do with it.</v>

1068
00:41:35.890 --> 00:41:39.530
<v Speaker 2>Because when they heard the record and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>went to the top of the top of those big</v>

1069
00:41:39.810 --> 00:41:42.830
<v Speaker 2>brokers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cutting companies and I sat there and</v>

<v Speaker 2>Take this line out and I the second they</v>

1073

<v Speaker 2>you know I took the meetings,</v>

1075
00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:56.240
<v Speaker 2>I figured it's worth taking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1076
00:41:56.270 --> 00:41:58.670
<v Speaker 2>I'll listen to them.</v>

1077
00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:02.420
<v Speaker 2>and I will tell you this and this is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>credit to the producer Dave,</v>

<v Speaker 2>but it was not a cre.</v>

1080
00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:14.780
<v Speaker 2>The amount of money that it cost to make</v>
<v Speaker 2>a record in 2016 is not that much</v>

1081
00:42:14.781 --> 00:42:15.380
<v Speaker 2>fucking money.</v>

1082
00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:16.880
<v Speaker 2>When you look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you look at it,</v>

1083
00:42:17.020 --> 00:42:22.020
<v Speaker 2>right to sell years fucking the labels</v>
<v Speaker 2>will make it cost a million by charging</v>

<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went a little higher but it,</v>

1090
00:42:35.561 --> 00:42:37.850
<v Speaker 2>even that my jaw dropped when he told me</v>
<v Speaker 2>the prize.</v>

1091
00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:39.860

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I don't want people to come to him</v>

00:42:46.791 --> 00:42:51.791
<v Speaker 2>you charged him so and so and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also since then he's also his last</v>

1097
00:42:51.891 --> 00:42:53.480
<v Speaker 2>director.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's sold millions of records</v>

1098
00:42:53.481 --> 00:42:55.310
<v Speaker 2>since then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so as I'm sure it was price is going up.</v>

1099
00:42:55.311 --> 00:42:57.530
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's also,</v>

1100
00:42:57.531 --> 00:42:59.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure if some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he loved it,</v>

1101
00:42:59.031 --> 00:42:59.900
<v Speaker 2>an artist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'd just,</v>

1102
00:42:59.901 --> 00:43:03.150
<v Speaker 2>he'd record them for fucking free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if he's some of the big label,</v>

1103
00:43:03.151 --> 00:43:04.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'll take whatever you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>They essentially do it for free.</v>

<v Speaker 3>They go and they'll do a cameo on each</v>
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I could sing.</v>

1150
00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:11.410
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could go sang some auto tune.</v>

1151
00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:12.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With the audit cut up.</v>

1152
00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:14.370
<v Speaker 1>You got the look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got everything.</v>

1153
00:45:14.371 --> 00:45:16.770
<v Speaker 1>You knew some like Peter Frampton ship</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when we used to do,</v>

1154
00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:19.290
<v Speaker 1>do you feel like I do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was like the first guy to use auto</v>

1155
00:45:19.291 --> 00:45:20.590
<v Speaker 1>tune.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't that auto tune?</v>

1156
00:45:20.610 --> 00:45:23.580
<v Speaker 1>I think that was a different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A voco you know that thing with the</v>

1157
00:45:23.581 --> 00:45:24.600
<v Speaker 1>guitar?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like no,</v>

1158
00:45:25.740 --> 00:45:28.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that was up to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>

1159
00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:29.461
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had,</v>

1160
00:45:29.461 --> 00:45:30.870
<v Speaker 1>what was it called?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The talk box.</v>

1161
00:45:30.950 --> 00:45:31.960
<v Speaker 1>Talk Box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1162
00:45:32.090 --> 00:45:34.740
<v Speaker 1>James.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a friend who worked who,</v>

1163
00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:37.890
<v Speaker 1>who uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>auto tune a major country pop star.</v>

1164
00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:41.070
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said my voice was fucking better.</v>

1165
00:45:41.250 --> 00:45:43.410
<v Speaker 1>Congratulations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said who looked better and I</v>

1166
00:45:43.411 --> 00:45:45.150
<v Speaker 1>didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't tell you that you don't get a</v>

1167
00:45:45.151 --> 00:45:46.470
<v Speaker 1>response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1168
00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:50.820
<v Speaker 1>I think there's nothing wrong with</v>
<v Speaker 1>making those two and a half men shows.</v>

1169
00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:52.470
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing wrong with what we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>

1170
00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:57.420
<v Speaker 1>But as far as like what interest me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not interested in those poppy songs.</v>

1171
00:45:57.421 --> 00:46:00.300
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it goes in my head and my head just</v>

1172
00:46:00.301 --> 00:46:01.410
<v Speaker 1>starts rejecting it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1173
00:46:01.420 --> 00:46:02.400
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're eating plastic.</v>

1174
00:46:02.401 --> 00:46:03.400
<v Speaker 1>Get it out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1175
00:46:03.410 --> 00:46:06.360
<v Speaker 1>it's like you could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could live for like a few days off</v>

1176
00:46:06.361 --> 00:46:09.720
<v Speaker 1>of hostess cupcakes if you wanted to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could probably live for a month.</v>

1177
00:46:10.030 --> 00:46:11.610
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just hostess cupcakes.</v>

1178
00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:13.770
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't recommend it though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1179
00:46:13.771 --> 00:46:15.330
<v Speaker 1>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would definitely not recommend that.</v>

1180
00:46:15.331 --> 00:46:16.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'd be fucking your,</v>

1181
00:46:16.770 --> 00:46:18.630
<v Speaker 1>your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your brain would probably fucking,</v>

1182
00:46:19.130 --> 00:46:20.550
<v Speaker 1>you probably have no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no protein,</v>

1183
00:46:20.551 --> 00:46:22.470
<v Speaker 1>no vitamins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long could you live off hostess</v>

1184
00:46:22.471 --> 00:46:24.120
<v Speaker 1>cupcakes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's gotta be the equivalent of just</v>

1185
00:46:24.330 --> 00:46:25.650
<v Speaker 1>going without food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1186
00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:27.990
<v Speaker 1>There would be a really interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>experiment.</v>

1187
00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:28.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they should do that.</v>

1188
00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:31.270
<v Speaker 1>We could do that red band,</v>
<v Speaker 1>red band,</v>

1189
00:46:31.290 --> 00:46:31.990
<v Speaker 1>be willing to do that.</v>

1190
00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:33.360
<v Speaker 1>That's supersize me guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did.</v>

1191
00:46:33.361 --> 00:46:34.530
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just said fast food.</v>

1192
00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:36.730
<v Speaker 1>He did fast food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if someone just eight hosts,</v>

1193
00:46:36.810 --> 00:46:39.090
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people just eat fast food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That didn't really count.</v>

1194
00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:40.210
<v Speaker 1>That's normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1195
00:46:40.530 --> 00:46:41.610
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people.</v>

1196
00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:42.421
<v Speaker 1>Amen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1197
00:46:42.421 --> 00:46:47.130
<v Speaker 1>People have criticized that show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That movie supersize me like all of his</v>

1198
00:46:47.131 --> 00:46:48.450

<v Speaker 1>all that stuff.</v>

1199
00:46:48.451 --> 00:46:49.440
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>

1200
00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:50.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I remember he like,</v>

1201
00:46:50.521 --> 00:46:53.550
<v Speaker 1>he threw up on day one a festival all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

1202
00:46:53.570 --> 00:46:56.010
<v Speaker 1>You don't fucking Barf,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he wasn't saying it's Vegan or</v>

1203
00:46:56.011 --> 00:46:56.701
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before that,</v>

1204
00:46:56.701 --> 00:46:59.130
<v Speaker 1>it was like super healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before that was a Vegan chef or</v>

1205
00:46:59.131 --> 00:46:59.780
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1206
00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:02.430
<v Speaker 1>but also I always get pissed when I see</v>
<v Speaker 1>you moving like that and they're like</v>

1207
00:47:03.410 --> 00:47:06.510
<v Speaker 1>any in conclusion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fast food is not good for you.</v>

1208
00:47:06.511 --> 00:47:06.961
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>not only that,</v>

1211
00:47:09.721 --> 00:47:11.280
<v Speaker 1>they say don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't need it every day.</v>

1212
00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:12.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not supposed to eat it every day.</v>

1213
00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:15.720
<v Speaker 1>That fast food is supposed to be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>guilty thing that you eat when you got</v>

1214
00:47:15.721 --> 00:47:18.360
<v Speaker 1>no time to do anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you want to just pull on the Burger</v>

1215
00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:18.571
<v Speaker 1>King.</v>

1216
00:47:18.571 --> 00:47:19.404

<v Speaker 1>Let's do this.</v>

1217
00:47:19.590 --> 00:47:22.200
<v Speaker 1>That's what it's supposed to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twice a year you get hung over and you</v>

1218
00:47:22.201 --> 00:47:24.300
<v Speaker 1>go to fucking Jack in the box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Above is fine.</v>

1219
00:47:24.301 --> 00:47:25.230
<v Speaker 1>It's no big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't,</v>

1220
00:47:25.580 --> 00:47:28.950
<v Speaker 1>the people that aren't like thinking of</v>
<v Speaker 1>slinging health food,</v>

1221
00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:29.793
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1222
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:32.260
<v Speaker 1>Well they're trying to catch up to that</v>
<v Speaker 1>now though.</v>

1223
00:47:32.261 --> 00:47:35.550
<v Speaker 1>You see like Mcdonald's has salads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's,</v>

1224
00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:37.720
<v Speaker 1>imagine how nasty that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

1225
00:47:37.721 --> 00:47:39.220
<v Speaker 1>their salad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does it tastes like?</v>

1226
00:47:39.221 --> 00:47:40.790
<v Speaker 1>Like Fukushima letters?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if it,</v>

1227
00:47:40.930 --> 00:47:42.820
<v Speaker 1>what if it was like the best salad</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've ever had?</v>

1228
00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:44.560
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's possible.</v>

1229
00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:46.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is totally possible.</v>

1230
00:47:46.210 --> 00:47:46.960
<v Speaker 1>Like you just don't want it.</v>

1231
00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:48.520
<v Speaker 1>Like that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are new,</v>

1232
00:47:48.521 --> 00:47:51.480
<v Speaker 1>a sponsor on your fucking show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1233
00:47:51.550 --> 00:47:53.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever had any big corporate</v>

1234
00:47:53.021 --> 00:47:54.250
<v Speaker 1>sponsors on here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1235
00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:56.920
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I prefer to do it the way we're doing it</v>

1236
00:47:56.921 --> 00:47:59.680
<v Speaker 1>to mostly companies that sell things</v>
<v Speaker 1>only online.</v>

1237
00:48:00.010 --> 00:48:01.780
<v Speaker 1>Well that's squarespace and stuff like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1238
00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:02.330
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1239
00:48:02.330 --> 00:48:05.560
<v Speaker 1>I think the website development company</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got,</v>

1240
00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:08.540
<v Speaker 1>I've gotten emails from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they do my website well,</v>

1241
00:48:08.690 --> 00:48:11.740
<v Speaker 1>you can make your own website on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's super easy to do.</v>

1242
00:48:11.950 --> 00:48:16.120
<v Speaker 1>But there's like a lot of companies that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're using the internet now and using</v>

1243
00:48:16.121 --> 00:48:17.350
<v Speaker 1>podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sponsors,</v>

1244
00:48:17.410 --> 00:48:20.680
<v Speaker 1>because they don't have to have a store,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have to have like a retail</v>

1245
00:48:20.681 --> 00:48:23.830
<v Speaker 1>place and have to have a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 1>employees that were an Abercrombie and</v>

1246
00:48:23.831 --> 00:48:26.380
<v Speaker 1>Fitch spray.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can just sell stuff online.</v>

1247
00:48:26.410 --> 00:48:30.970
<v Speaker 1>I think someone was telling me at the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the place that distributes the record</v>

1248
00:48:30.971 --> 00:48:33.940
<v Speaker 1>that</v>
<v Speaker 1>80 more or something,</v>

1249
00:48:33.941 --> 00:48:38.290
<v Speaker 1>more percent of my albums sold have been</v>
<v Speaker 1>itunes and Amazon because people can't</v>

1250
00:48:38.291 --> 00:48:39.220
<v Speaker 1>find,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no way to,</v>

1251
00:48:39.250 --> 00:48:40.100
<v Speaker 1>the stores aren't carrying.</v>

1252
00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:41.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now one can find it.</v>

1253
00:48:41.591 --> 00:48:43.510
<v Speaker 1>And when I was a kid and when you were a</v>
<v Speaker 1>kid,</v>

1254
00:48:44.050 --> 00:48:46.300
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if word of mouth got to you about</v>

1255
00:48:46.301 --> 00:48:47.590
<v Speaker 1>this record,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't buy it.</v>

1256
00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:49.630
<v Speaker 1>You went in Kentucky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to the record store.</v>

1257
00:48:49.631 --> 00:48:52.030
<v Speaker 1>I remember I want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone was telling me about the velvet</v>

1258
00:48:52.031 --> 00:48:53.350
<v Speaker 1>underground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to go here,</v>

1259
00:48:53.380 --> 00:48:56.950
<v Speaker 1>velvet underground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I went to this local record store and</v>

1260
00:48:56.980 --> 00:48:58.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1261
00:48:58.031 --> 00:49:00.130

1262
00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:02.170

<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1263
00:49:02.171 --> 00:49:03.940
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1264
00:49:03.941 --> 00:49:05.870
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He be like four weeks to hear what this</v>

1265
00:49:05.871 --> 00:49:08.680
<v Speaker 1>band sounds like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he had a high from a catalog.</v>

1266
00:49:08.860 --> 00:49:09.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd be,</v>

1267
00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:12.760
<v Speaker 1>they had a catalog of all every record</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause no one in there's buying it.</v>

1268
00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:14.110
<v Speaker 1>So why would they order it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1269
00:49:14.111 --> 00:49:16.750
<v Speaker 1>So you have to order it and then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>just have to buy it and listen to it</v>

1270
00:49:16.751 --> 00:49:17.740
<v Speaker 1>because you're not going to hear it</v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

1271
00:49:17.770 --> 00:49:20.320
<v Speaker 1>That's what we're asked to me is the big</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing has changed music.</v>

1272
00:49:20.321 --> 00:49:21.790
<v Speaker 1>Like I used to again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

1273
00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:24.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even Lexan,</v>

1274
00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:26.590
<v Speaker 1>which is not that small of a town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're an island.</v>

1275
00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:28.660
<v Speaker 1>Rarely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you would get rolling stone.</v>

1276
00:49:28.661 --> 00:49:32.020
<v Speaker 1>You read about like the Jesus Lizard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you remember that band</v>

1277
00:49:32.021 --> 00:49:33.220
<v Speaker 1>really hardcore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were really cool.</v>

1278
00:49:33.221 --> 00:49:36.870
<v Speaker 1>And I remember the guy writing about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Lizard in Rolling Stone said it.</v>

1279
00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:37.900
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real,</v>

1280
00:49:37.901 --> 00:49:40.540
<v Speaker 1>at least is not a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These fuckers are fucking crazy.</v>

1281
00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:43.620
<v Speaker 1>And it's the craziest music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whenever they said got me wind listened</v>

1282
00:49:43.630 --> 00:49:45.760
<v Speaker 1>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nowadays you read that you don't need</v>

1283
00:49:45.761 --> 00:49:47.800
<v Speaker 1>the article,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just click on the fucking music.</v>

1284
00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:51.700
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I had to wait weeks to fucking hear</v>

1285
00:49:51.701 --> 00:49:53.830
<v Speaker 1>that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't press on the fucking article</v>

1286
00:49:53.831 --> 00:49:57.550
<v Speaker 1>and it's like the mystery of it's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that being said,</v>

1287
00:49:57.551 --> 00:49:59.320
<v Speaker 1>the positive is that I can actually sell</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

1288
00:50:00.190 --> 00:50:02.290
<v Speaker 1>my record fucking m street.</v>

1289
00:50:02.350 --> 00:50:05.710
<v Speaker 1>It's all positives to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can sell your record also that like,</v>

1290
00:50:06.220 --> 00:50:09.490
<v Speaker 1>like people could start talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>you through twitter and facebook and</v>

1291
00:50:09.491 --> 00:50:12.250
<v Speaker 1>things along those lines and it just</v>
<v Speaker 1>spreads across the whole country like</v>

1292
00:50:12.251 --> 00:50:12.851
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1293
00:50:12.851 --> 00:50:16.340
<v Speaker 1>can you imagine even 10 years ago or if</v>
<v Speaker 1>not more like,</v>

1294
00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:18.940
<v Speaker 1>like I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm banned from Walmart.</v>

1295
00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:22.330
<v Speaker 1>Imagine getting that call 10 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're gestating devastating.</v>

1296
00:50:22.590 --> 00:50:24.340
<v Speaker 1>This wasn't even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a divorce.</v>

1297
00:50:24.370 --> 00:50:26.320
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course you're going to be banned from</v>

1298
00:50:26.321 --> 00:50:28.430
<v Speaker 1>Walmart does honor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1299
00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:31.190
<v Speaker 1>I think they probably use just like they</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

1300
00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:34.310
<v Speaker 1>they probably band 50 other records.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1301

<v Speaker 1>Band.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So much shit.</v>

1302
00:50:35.810 --> 00:50:37.400
<v Speaker 1>But there's this whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you are talking about,</v>

<v Speaker 1>copies,</v>

<v Speaker 1>listen.</v>

1311
00:50:55.371 --> 00:50:57.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you still do radio promote</v>
<v Speaker 1>shows and shit like that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>they're a charity thing.</v>

1315
00:51:04.170 --> 00:51:06.440
<v Speaker 1>They're awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of the time I'm not doing that much</v>

1316
00:51:06.441 --> 00:51:06.920
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

1317
00:51:06.920 --> 00:51:09.500
<v Speaker 1>that's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See I talked too much already.</v>

1318
00:51:09.830 --> 00:51:11.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to talk more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's all.</v>

1319
00:51:12.260 --> 00:51:13.160
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm jealous,</v>

1320
00:51:13.161 --> 00:51:15.530
<v Speaker 1>but then the second of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's awesome that you got a big enough</v>

1321
00:51:15.531 --> 00:51:17.540
<v Speaker 1>platform that you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to do it.</v>

1322
00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:19.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's super fortunate,</v>

1323
00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:21.920
<v Speaker 1>but I mean it's not that I didn't enjoy</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing some radio,</v>

1324
00:51:21.921 --> 00:51:23.960
<v Speaker 1>but the problem is for us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in the morning.</v>

1325
00:51:24.410 --> 00:51:26.510
<v Speaker 1>Like for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always at like six o'clock in the</v>

1326
00:51:26.511 --> 00:51:27.920
<v Speaker 1>morning or seven o'clock in the morning.</v>

1327
00:51:27.980 --> 00:51:29.360
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're preaching to the converted.</v>

1328
00:51:29.361 --> 00:51:30.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to get up.</v>

1329
00:51:31.340 --> 00:51:32.060
<v Speaker 1>I've had to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1330
00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:36.680
<v Speaker 1>get up at seven to do fucking radio idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can only listen to it at a</v>

1331
00:51:36.681 --> 00:51:41.330
<v Speaker 1>specific time is so fucking stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't have to do that anymore.</v>

1332
00:51:41.331 --> 00:51:43.150
<v Speaker 1>We have a way better way of getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuck.</v>

1333
00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:45.140
<v Speaker 1>So funny you said that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm so dumb.</v>

1334
00:51:45.141 --> 00:51:49.550
<v Speaker 1>It's like who are they fooling?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like why?</v>

1335
00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:52.370
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think like podcasts would</v>
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>

1336
00:51:52.550 --> 00:51:54.080
<v Speaker 1>we're going to happen no matter what</v>
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>

1337
00:51:54.110 --> 00:51:56.460
<v Speaker 1>If it was just bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who fucking started,</v>

1338
00:51:56.480 --> 00:52:00.110
<v Speaker 1>but it had to happen because people want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to listen to what they want and what to</v>

1339
00:52:00.111 --> 00:52:02.420
<v Speaker 1>do and when you fucking get startup your</v>
<v Speaker 1>car again,</v>

1340

<v Speaker 1>off,</v>

1341
00:52:04.130 --> 00:52:07.010
<v Speaker 1>left off and it just syncs up to cart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rocket Science.</v>

1342
00:52:07.070 --> 00:52:07.521
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1343

<v Speaker 1>I look at the the podcast,</v>

1345

1348
00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:21.320
<v Speaker 1>And then my car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the light turns green.</v>

1349
00:52:21.321 --> 00:52:23.480
<v Speaker 1>I start driving and I'm listening to you</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

1350

<v Speaker 1>The old days you'd go,</v>

00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:41.570
<v Speaker 1>you know how things you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>

1358
00:52:41.571 --> 00:52:44.000

<v Speaker 1>time or listen to the radio,</v>

1359
00:52:44.030 --> 00:52:45.240
<v Speaker 1>like drive time.</v>

<v Speaker 1>drive and the will,</v>

1362
00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:50.810
<v Speaker 1>the first thing that switched it up with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sirius Xm,</v>

1363
00:52:51.050 --> 00:52:52.940
<v Speaker 1>cause when serious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it was x Sam,</v>

1364
00:52:53.060 --> 00:52:55.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a opie and anthony were on and</v>

<v Speaker 1>Howard stern's on what they figured out</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they were doing this.</v>

1366
00:52:58.101 --> 00:52:58.934
<v Speaker 1>Or it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1367
00:52:59.030 --> 00:53:02.870
<v Speaker 1>we don't have to have any censorship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could say whatever the fuck we want.</v>

1368
00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:06.200
<v Speaker 1>But they started getting in trouble too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like opie and Anthony got banned off the</v>

1369
00:53:06.201 --> 00:53:08.960
<v Speaker 1>air once because they brought in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>homeless guy and he started talking</v>

1370
00:53:08.961 --> 00:53:13.010
<v Speaker 1>about banging Condoleezza Rice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh I didn't,</v>

1371
00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:14.570
<v Speaker 1>I did open anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were cool.</v>

1372
00:53:14.571 --> 00:53:17.090
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not opening anthony now opiate</v>

1373
00:53:17.100 --> 00:53:21.180
<v Speaker 1>and Jimmy Anthony's got his own thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>now he's got,</v>

1374

<v Speaker 1>he got care radio.</v>

1375
00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:25.980
<v Speaker 1>But I remember it was funny too because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're right</v>

1376
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:28.140
<v Speaker 3>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sirius Xm was one a big thing.</v>

1377
00:53:28.141 --> 00:53:30.990
<v Speaker 3>Cause I remember when hat on stern who I</v>
<v Speaker 3>used to listen to,</v>

1378
00:53:31.050 --> 00:53:31.471
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

1379
00:53:31.471 --> 00:53:33.750
<v Speaker 3>I lived in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's do later because Kentucky,</v>

1380
00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:37.200
<v Speaker 3>my home town didn't have stern going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I started listening to him and I</v>

1381
00:53:37.201 --> 00:53:40.510
<v Speaker 3>loved him and the city is going to sell</v>
<v Speaker 3>like radio where can say wherever it</v>

1382
00:53:40.511 --> 00:53:41.970
<v Speaker 3>wants and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1383
00:53:41.971 --> 00:53:44.160
<v Speaker 3>he's not going to be as funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Half the fun is listen to him trying to</v>

1384
00:53:44.161 --> 00:53:46.380
<v Speaker 3>talk around and then you listen and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>

1385
00:53:46.590 --> 00:53:48.980
<v Speaker 3>that's such a fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so much fucking funny.</v>

1386
00:53:48.981 --> 00:53:51.010
<v Speaker 3>Or when he's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's just saying it.</v>

1387
00:53:51.210 --> 00:53:53.480
<v Speaker 3>That idea that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's more fun to be censored.</v>

1388
00:53:53.810 --> 00:53:57.460
<v Speaker 3>Love when people proof theory's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know that's a dump theory though.</v>

1389
00:53:57.540 --> 00:53:59.430
<v Speaker 3>That's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't you hear that all the time?</v>

1390
00:53:59.431 --> 00:54:00.610
<v Speaker 3>I heard that all the fucking time.</v>

1391
00:54:00.640 --> 00:54:02.580
<v Speaker 3>Never heard that I see here that about</v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy,</v>

1392
00:54:02.940 --> 00:54:06.110
<v Speaker 3>but I was always like whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sam kinison and Richard Pryor,</v>

1393
00:54:06.140 --> 00:54:08.730
<v Speaker 3>my all time favorites.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how the fuck can you tell me who's</v>

1394
00:54:08.731 --> 00:54:09.780
<v Speaker 3>funnier?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Richard Pryor.</v>

1395
00:54:09.781 --> 00:54:10.441
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was funny.</v>

1396
00:54:10.441 --> 00:54:13.740
<v Speaker 3>The Richard Pryor and how could you tell</v>
<v Speaker 3>me that beating around the Bush would be</v>

1397
00:54:13.741 --> 00:54:15.660
<v Speaker 3>better than what prior was doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't,</v>

1398
00:54:15.780 --> 00:54:18.240
<v Speaker 3>you can't say you have to be quiet and</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe it was more in the south,</v>

1399
00:54:18.241 --> 00:54:19.074
<v Speaker 3>but I kept hearing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1400
00:54:19.290 --> 00:54:22.260
<v Speaker 3>now that he's not got like the FCC to</v>
<v Speaker 3>fight against and he can,</v>

1401
00:54:22.261 --> 00:54:24.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fun was him trying to get around the</v>

1402
00:54:24.331 --> 00:54:26.640
<v Speaker 3>census and he really listened to it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go,</v>

1403
00:54:26.641 --> 00:54:29.510
<v Speaker 3>it's so much fucking better now that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know shit.</v>

1404
00:54:29.930 --> 00:54:32.220
<v Speaker 3>Just to be free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Completely free to express yourself</v>

1405
00:54:32.221 --> 00:54:36.030
<v Speaker 3>without any worry about a word that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to get you fine for hundreds of</v>

1406
00:54:36.030 --> 00:54:36.170
<v Speaker 3>thousands of dollars.</v>

1407
00:54:36.170 --> 00:54:39.630
<v Speaker 3>And you got to remember like he got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he got sued by the FCC,</v>

1408
00:54:39.631 --> 00:54:41.910
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like [inaudible] task.</v>

1409
00:54:41.911 --> 00:54:46.860
<v Speaker 3>He had to go to court over that shit and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they wound up finding him like ungodly</v>

1410
00:54:46.861 --> 00:54:49.770
<v Speaker 3>amounts of money and there was nobody</v>
<v Speaker 3>out there with him when he was doing</v>

1411
00:54:49.771 --> 00:54:51.740
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he's this,</v>

1412
00:54:51.750 --> 00:54:54.210
<v Speaker 3>one of the reasons why I'll never</v>
<v Speaker 3>criticize that guy.</v>

1413
00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:56.580
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like one of the most important</v>

1414
00:54:56.581 --> 00:55:01.581
<v Speaker 3>pioneers when it comes to radio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if it wasn't for that guy and going</v>

1415
00:55:01.651 --> 00:55:03.710
<v Speaker 3>out there like that and getting sued</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1416
00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:06.060
<v Speaker 3>and having,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was all during the fucking Bush</v>

1417
00:55:06.061 --> 00:55:09.930
<v Speaker 3>administration man when they were those</v>
<v Speaker 3>johnny and Jack fucking time.</v>

1418
00:55:09.990 --> 00:55:11.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those John Ashcroft fucks.</v>

1419
00:55:11.731 --> 00:55:13.860
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That guy was scary though.</v>

1420
00:55:13.861 --> 00:55:15.480
<v Speaker 3>All these people that were trying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was,</v>

1421
00:55:15.481 --> 00:55:17.550
<v Speaker 3>there was a lot of religious shit behind</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1422
00:55:17.560 --> 00:55:20.220
<v Speaker 3>It'll be shit their shit in their boots</v>
<v Speaker 3>over this fucking record.</v>

1423
00:55:20.870 --> 00:55:22.440
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would be dying over that record,</v>

1424
00:55:22.441 --> 00:55:24.270
<v Speaker 3>but he got sued.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he,</v>

1425
00:55:24.271 --> 00:55:26.520
<v Speaker 3>he actually had to spend real money and</v>
<v Speaker 3>real stress.</v>

1426
00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:30.120
<v Speaker 3>Imagine the government trying to take</v>
<v Speaker 3>you out all you are as a dirty morning</v>

1427
00:55:30.121 --> 00:55:33.000
<v Speaker 3>radio guy and the fucking government is</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to take you out.</v>

1428
00:55:33.030 --> 00:55:34.620
<v Speaker 3>You fucking probably get paranoid as</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

1429
00:55:34.650 --> 00:55:37.110
<v Speaker 3>You should get paranoid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You fucking should be paranoid.</v>

1430
00:55:37.170 --> 00:55:40.470
<v Speaker 3>What does it say here Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There all the different fines he had to</v>

1431

<v Speaker 3>got paid.</v>

1433
00:55:45.481 --> 00:55:47.180
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this isn't probably the initial fines</v>

1434
00:55:47.181 --> 00:55:49.590
<v Speaker 3>that they started as either,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think this is what they got</v>

1435
00:55:49.620 --> 00:55:54.620
<v Speaker 3>whittled down to or and read them off.</v>

<v Speaker 3>He but he didn't even say bad words.</v>

1445
00:56:35.381 --> 00:56:38.600
<v Speaker 3>He didn't swear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what was crazy was just top its</v>

1446
00:56:38.601 --> 00:56:41.650
<v Speaker 3>subject matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The d like talking about farts or Piss</v>

1447
00:56:41.651 --> 00:56:44.650

<v Speaker 3>It was so crazy though.</v>

1448
00:56:44.651 --> 00:56:47.260
<v Speaker 3>Such a crazy time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I were to say that to someone who</v>

1449
00:56:47.261 --> 00:56:48.010
<v Speaker 3>didn't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they think,</v>

1450
00:56:48.010 --> 00:56:52.150
<v Speaker 3>oh you mean that the 50s or the 40 this</v>
<v Speaker 3>is fucking 2000 thousand four and if he</v>

1451
00:56:52.151 --> 00:56:55.210
<v Speaker 3>didn't go through that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there wasn't this backlash from the</v>

1452
00:56:55.211 --> 00:56:58.330
<v Speaker 3>public finding out about it because</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody I know that heard about it was</v>

1453
00:56:58.331 --> 00:56:59.164
<v Speaker 3>like what?</v>

1454
00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:04.200
<v Speaker 3>How are they wasting our fucking money?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Suing him over a radio show that by the</v>

1455
00:57:04.541 --> 00:57:07.660
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has 20 million people listening to it</v>

1456
00:57:07.661 --> 00:57:09.880
<v Speaker 3>every morning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty obvious that people were</v>

1457
00:57:09.881 --> 00:57:12.790
<v Speaker 3>enjoying this radio show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when they stop enjoying it,</v>

1458
00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:15.100
<v Speaker 3>it'll go off the air.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what the fucking free market is</v>

1459
00:57:15.101 --> 00:57:16.660
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it wasn't about that.</v>

1460
00:57:16.661 --> 00:57:20.050
<v Speaker 3>What it was about is controlling</v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhat cause it wasn't just his dirty</v>

1461
00:57:20.051 --> 00:57:22.120
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not what concerned them as much</v>

1462
00:57:22.121 --> 00:57:23.980
<v Speaker 3>as his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his criticism of the Bush</v>

1463
00:57:23.981 --> 00:57:25.700
<v Speaker 3>administration,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his criticism,</v>

1464
00:57:25.900 --> 00:57:29.620
<v Speaker 3>political political policies and his</v>
<v Speaker 3>willingness to say whatever the fuck he</v>

1465
00:57:29.621 --> 00:57:31.030
<v Speaker 3>wants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a dangerous guy.</v>

1466
00:57:31.060 --> 00:57:33.040
<v Speaker 3>He said too much power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You thank him.</v>

1467
00:57:33.490 --> 00:57:35.560
<v Speaker 3>You think that's what Kinda started</v>
<v Speaker 3>podcasts?</v>

1468
00:57:35.561 --> 00:57:36.850
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1469
00:57:36.851 --> 00:57:38.440
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's what started</v>
<v Speaker 3>podcasts.</v>

1470
00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:41.140
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think that for him that started</v>

1471
00:57:41.141 --> 00:57:41.800
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1472
00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:45.700
<v Speaker 3>the journey eventually to Xm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he had due to serious whatever it</v>

1473
00:57:45.701 --> 00:57:47.410
<v Speaker 3>was at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had to,</v>

1474
00:57:47.740 --> 00:57:49.480
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were fucking with him constantly</v>

1475

<v Speaker 3>all the time.</v>

1476
00:57:50.310 --> 00:57:52.270
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he gets enough credit for</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1477
00:57:52.271 --> 00:57:53.470
<v Speaker 3>It's insanity,</v>

<v Speaker 3>games and stuff too.</v>

1483
00:58:08.051 --> 00:58:13.030
<v Speaker 3>If you remember the Tennessee guy and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then he got to vis and attorney Jack</v>

1484

<v Speaker 3>but it was official.</v>

1489
00:58:23.080 --> 00:58:26.680
<v Speaker 3>I guarantee you a lot of it was about</v>
<v Speaker 3>controlling a powerful guy.</v>

1490
00:58:26.860 --> 00:58:29.020
<v Speaker 3>Cause he had talked about running for</v>
<v Speaker 3>governor member,</v>

1491
00:58:29.500 --> 00:58:30.310
<v Speaker 3>remember?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1492
00:58:30.310 --> 00:58:31.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he would have got to have to</v>

1493
00:58:31.511 --> 00:58:34.480
<v Speaker 3>disclose how much money he made and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's when he decided not to do it.</v>

1494
00:58:34.600 --> 00:58:38.050
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if he would do that now because</v>
<v Speaker 3>now everybody knows he's got a hundreds</v>

1495
00:58:38.050 --> 00:58:39.870
<v Speaker 3>of millions of dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if it even like the gut people</v>

1496
00:58:39.880 --> 00:58:41.860
<v Speaker 3>run now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They haven't disclosed shit.</v>

1497
00:58:42.100 --> 00:58:43.300
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trump has.</v>

1498
00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:45.490
<v Speaker 3>Trump says he's worth more than he</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually is.</v>

1499
00:58:45.491 --> 00:58:47.500
<v Speaker 3>That's what's hilarious about him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

1500
00:58:47.501 --> 00:58:49.600
<v Speaker 3>but I'm saying has he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have we seen the actual like,</v>

1501
00:58:49.690 --> 00:58:51.370
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bernie Sanders just released his tax</v>

1502
00:58:51.371 --> 00:58:55.630

<v Speaker 3>made less money last year than Hillary</v>

1503
00:58:55.630 --> 00:58:58.030
<v Speaker 3>Clinton did for one single speech.</v>

<v Speaker 3>as I think to 90 for once be maybe even</v>

1505
00:59:03.281 --> 00:59:06.010
<v Speaker 3>in the threes for one speech.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to ask you to negotiate.</v>

1519
00:59:35.211 --> 00:59:37.460
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just bizarre that she won't release</v>

<v Speaker 1>the transcripts of the bribery money</v>

1521
00:59:39.831 --> 00:59:42.510
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to release something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always been good.</v>

1522
00:59:42.530 --> 00:59:44.690
<v Speaker 1>Imagine what she said.</v>

00:59:53.751 --> 00:59:56.270
<v Speaker 1>she kept her mouth shut.</v>

1547
01:00:32.950 --> 01:00:34.220
<v Speaker 1>He thought he was worried for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>

1548
01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:36.320
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was really weird.</v>

1574
01:01:33.471 --> 01:01:36.110
<v Speaker 1>This is before porn hit the internet and</v>

1575
01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:36.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1576
01:01:36.830 --> 01:01:39.140
<v Speaker 1>back then he was selling those</v>
<v Speaker 1>magazines.</v>

1577
01:01:39.290 --> 01:01:42.290
<v Speaker 1>He was rich from selling magazine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was going to lose everything because</v>

1578
01:01:42.291 --> 01:01:44.480
<v Speaker 1>of a fucking joke,</v>

<v Speaker 1>When I first came to la,</v>

1581
01:01:47.991 --> 01:01:51.170

<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1583
01:01:52.070 --> 01:01:55.390
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the norm is fucking huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know some of the,</v>

1584
01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:57.100
<v Speaker 1>the of his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1585
01:01:57.510 --> 01:02:00.620
<v Speaker 1>I've met him briefly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know some of his family members back</v>

1586
01:02:00.621 --> 01:02:02.270
<v Speaker 1>in Kentucky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>they got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1588
01:02:03.771 --> 01:02:05.210
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an empire,</v>

1589
01:02:05.211 --> 01:02:07.810
<v Speaker 1>but also I think when he dies it'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>come.</v>

1590
01:02:07.870 --> 01:02:09.080
<v Speaker 1>There'll be talking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1591
01:02:09.081 --> 01:02:11.870
<v Speaker 1>they'll be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll be the jokey national new shit,</v>

1592
01:02:11.871 --> 01:02:16.871
<v Speaker 1>but there'll be some really interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking pieces written about what he</v>

1593
01:02:17.511 --> 01:02:18.170
<v Speaker 1>actually did.</v>

1594
01:02:18.170 --> 01:02:21.570
<v Speaker 1>Cause he really changed everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like this album,</v>

1595
01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:23.520
<v Speaker 1>literally this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't make this album without</v>

1596
01:02:23.521 --> 01:02:24.210
<v Speaker 1>lyric.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

1597
01:02:24.210 --> 01:02:27.330
<v Speaker 1>And I think that what was going on with</v>
<v Speaker 1>him at the same time as what was going</v>

1598
01:02:27.331 --> 01:02:29.550
<v Speaker 1>on with a Howard Stern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were all real similar.</v>

1599
01:02:29.730 --> 01:02:32.850
<v Speaker 1>I was real similar in the government was</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to decide what people couldn't,</v>

1600
01:02:32.890 --> 01:02:36.210
<v Speaker 1>couldn't do and the people that didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>get defended where the dirty ones,</v>

1601
01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:38.790
<v Speaker 1>dirty magazine guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dirty radio guy,</v>

1602
01:02:38.791 --> 01:02:41.040
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason we didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't get defended.</v>

1603
01:02:41.041 --> 01:02:43.290
<v Speaker 1>Where a journalist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if a journalist is getting attacked like</v>

1604
01:02:43.291 --> 01:02:44.940
<v Speaker 1>that for revealing the truth about</v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

1605
01:02:44.941 --> 01:02:47.310
<v Speaker 1>people would be up in arms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the intellectuals be up in arms,</v>

1606
01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:50.520
<v Speaker 1>but nobody recognized that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just as dangerous to tell people</v>

1607
01:02:50.521 --> 01:02:54.030
<v Speaker 1>that they can't jerk off to hustler as</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is to tell,</v>

1608
01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:54.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

1609
01:02:54.770 --> 01:02:56.960
<v Speaker 1>a political dissident that he can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>speak.</v>

1610
01:02:56.980 --> 01:02:59.250
<v Speaker 1>That's what I said at the trial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the Ed Norton Guy Played Him.</v>

1611
01:02:59.251 --> 01:03:01.490
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this has nothing to do with whether you</v>

1612
01:03:01.510 --> 01:03:02.370
<v Speaker 1>like hustler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1613
01:03:02.540 --> 01:03:05.100
<v Speaker 1>Has to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's no different than any free speech</v>

1614
01:03:05.730 --> 01:03:07.770
<v Speaker 1>trial anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But by the way,</v>

1615
01:03:07.771 --> 01:03:08.820
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1616
01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.500
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you rule against this,</v>

1617
01:03:11.070 --> 01:03:14.340
<v Speaker 1>that it could lead to people being</v>
<v Speaker 1>censored in all,</v>

1618
01:03:14.341 --> 01:03:16.230
<v Speaker 1>in all different forms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this is,</v>

1619
01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:20.250
<v Speaker 1>it took something that fall that crazy</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get it to the supreme court and</v>

1620
01:03:20.251 --> 01:03:23.820
<v Speaker 1>someone that fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just too problematic when you,</v>

1621
01:03:23.821 --> 01:03:26.400
<v Speaker 1>when you tell people what they can and</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't talk about,</v>

1622
01:03:26.401 --> 01:03:28.170
<v Speaker 1>it's too problematic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1623
01:03:28.190 --> 01:03:30.870
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you censor someone for a specialty,</v>

1624
01:03:30.871 --> 01:03:33.990
<v Speaker 1>like sexual stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you censor someone for putting out</v>

1625
01:03:33.991 --> 01:03:35.690
<v Speaker 1>a magazine where people have sex and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1626
01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:37.410
<v Speaker 1>obviously people have liked that</v>
<v Speaker 1>forever.</v>

1627
01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:39.230
<v Speaker 1>You do know what the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the actual trial was.</v>

1628
01:03:39.310 --> 01:03:39.940
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

1629
01:03:39.940 --> 01:03:41.890
<v Speaker 1>I'll repeat if it was an obscenity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1630
01:03:41.910 --> 01:03:43.000
<v Speaker 1>But he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did it.</v>

1631
01:03:43.050 --> 01:03:45.510
<v Speaker 1>He acted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had comic pieces in the magazine</v>

1632
01:03:45.511 --> 01:03:49.080
<v Speaker 1>and he did a piece where he said that</v>
<v Speaker 1>this one,</v>

1633
01:03:49.081 --> 01:03:51.810
<v Speaker 1>I may need help,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Jerry is Jerry Falwell.</v>

1634
01:03:51.811 --> 01:03:53.470
<v Speaker 1>I think men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but men find it.</v>

1635
01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:55.860
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you said that before.</v>

1636
01:03:55.861 --> 01:03:57.990
<v Speaker 1>I find out it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to get the guy's name right</v>

1639
01:04:03.550 --> 01:04:05.570
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jerry Falwell's guy that got caught a</v>

1640
01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:07.620
<v Speaker 1>hooker too,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It was awesome.</v>

1643
01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:14.960
<v Speaker 1>You don't remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1644
01:04:15.290 --> 01:04:17.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean I used to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to watch that shit all the time.</v>

1645
01:04:17.411 --> 01:04:21.090
<v Speaker 1>It was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was amazing because we all knew that</v>

1646
01:04:21.091 --> 01:04:24.050
<v Speaker 1>he was a crazy fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We knew it's not your fault.</v>

1647
01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:28.680
<v Speaker 1>It's a Larry flynt and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just Google Larry Flynt Supreme Court.</v>

1648
01:04:28.681 --> 01:04:31.230
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the point was this preacher</v>

1649
01:04:32.730 --> 01:04:36.440
<v Speaker 1>had sex with his mom in and out house</v>
<v Speaker 1>and an outhouse.</v>

1650
01:04:36.470 --> 01:04:39.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the magazine and me had a cartoon of</v>

1651
01:04:39.181 --> 01:04:39.751
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1652
01:04:39.751 --> 01:04:41.650
<v Speaker 1>And I went and saw Larry Flynt speak</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I said,</v>

1653
01:04:41.730 --> 01:04:43.290
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big fan of his.</v>

1654
01:04:43.830 --> 01:04:47.040
<v Speaker 1>And so they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the guy sued him.</v>

1655
01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:48.810
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Jerry Falwell.</v>

1656
01:04:48.811 --> 01:04:49.644
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I thought.</v>

1657
01:04:49.830 --> 01:04:52.920
<v Speaker 1>So he said Jerry Falwell had sex with</v>
<v Speaker 1>his mom and an outhouse and there was a</v>

1658
01:04:52.930 --> 01:04:57.930
<v Speaker 1>cartoon like a mad magazine prior to and</v>
<v Speaker 1>your follow suit them for liable,</v>

1659
01:04:58.351 --> 01:04:58.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

1660
01:04:58.890 --> 01:05:01.110
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's obviously a fucking joke.</v>

1661
01:05:01.170 --> 01:05:02.670
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you know,</v>

1662
01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:05.760
<v Speaker 1>this is fucking comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he sued him and I went to the</v>

1663
01:05:05.761 --> 01:05:08.880
<v Speaker 1>fucking supreme court and I went and saw</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Larry flynt talk.</v>

1664
01:05:08.881 --> 01:05:12.030
<v Speaker 1>And when they repeat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the lawyer,</v>

1665
01:05:12.180 --> 01:05:15.060
<v Speaker 1>this is Larry Flynt said this is what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he knew he knew he was going to win</v>

1666
01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:18.700
<v Speaker 1>the supreme court trial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When his lawyer repeated</v>

1667
01:05:19.540 --> 01:05:24.540
<v Speaker 2>what the article said that his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his mom had sex at,</v>

1668
01:05:24.730 --> 01:05:27.280
<v Speaker 2>Jerry Falwell had sex his in our house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He saw the supreme,</v>

1669
01:05:27.281 --> 01:05:31.300
<v Speaker 2>he saw the judge just giggle for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>second and the lawyer stopped and he's</v>

1670
01:05:31.301 --> 01:05:35.170
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's when he knew he had the trial</v>

1671
01:05:35.171 --> 01:05:37.300
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause the whole point is you laughed</v>

1672
01:05:37.301 --> 01:05:40.660
<v Speaker 2>when I said it that this guy fucking his</v>
<v Speaker 2>mom out in an outhouse.</v>

1673
01:05:41.050 --> 01:05:44.320
<v Speaker 2>Obviously it's how are we going to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>an argument that's not comedy when all f</v>

1674
01:05:44.530 --> 01:05:47.230
<v Speaker 2>all you fuckers just started laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said from that point on,</v>

1675
01:05:47.231 --> 01:05:49.660
<v Speaker 2>he knew he was going to win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was funny too,</v>

1676
01:05:49.661 --> 01:05:53.680
<v Speaker 2>he also said that Jerry Falwell came to</v>
<v Speaker 2>him years later and they became friends</v>

1677
01:05:54.310 --> 01:05:56.590
<v Speaker 2>and he wanted to go do a speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause I guess he had,</v>

1678
01:05:56.920 --> 01:05:58.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe not watch his money.</v>

1679
01:05:58.690 --> 01:06:01.480
<v Speaker 2>He wanted to go do a speaking tour with</v>
<v Speaker 2>Larry Flynt.</v>

1680
01:06:02.290 --> 01:06:04.350
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1681
01:06:05.370 --> 01:06:05.951
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1682
01:06:05.951 --> 01:06:09.220
<v Speaker 2>I want the biggest supreme court freedom</v>
<v Speaker 2>of speech he's ever again.</v>

1683
01:06:09.490 --> 01:06:11.010
<v Speaker 2>He said he realized that's when they</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of,</v>

1684
01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:13.810
<v Speaker 2>it's like to Jerry Falwell too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all a show,</v>

1685
01:06:13.811 --> 01:06:15.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all,</v>

1686
01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:18.040
<v Speaker 2>it was just a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just theater to him.</v>

1687
01:06:18.580 --> 01:06:20.470
<v Speaker 2>Like we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can go out and make some money on the</v>

1688
01:06:20.471 --> 01:06:22.190
<v Speaker 2>road and talk about each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1689
01:06:22.220 --> 01:06:23.230
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck you.</v>

1690
01:06:23.231 --> 01:06:23.741
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

1691
01:06:23.741 --> 01:06:25.780
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was serious about it.</v>

1692
01:06:26.350 --> 01:06:27.100
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1693
01:06:27.100 --> 01:06:29.710
<v Speaker 2>when a funny though it was like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>party with Jerry Falwell find out what</v>

1694
01:06:29.711 --> 01:06:32.560
<v Speaker 2>it goes down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when he did become friends and</v>

1695
01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:33.820
<v Speaker 2>another one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to look,</v>

1696
01:06:33.910 --> 01:06:35.920
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm almost positive that when he died,</v>

1697
01:06:36.370 --> 01:06:37.790
<v Speaker 2>Larry Flynt wrote his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1698
01:06:37.810 --> 01:06:40.840
<v Speaker 2>maybe for the La Times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Larry Flynt wrote his obituary.</v>

1699
01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:42.070
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1700
01:06:42.550 --> 01:06:43.570
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

1701
01:06:43.571 --> 01:06:44.860
<v Speaker 2>they became friendly or later.</v>

1702
01:06:44.860 --> 01:06:46.420
<v Speaker 2>But it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an interesting trial.</v>

<v Speaker 2>movie is sums it up,</v>

01:07:16.521 --> 01:07:20.540
<v Speaker 1>on because they were so preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them and there was so graphic</v>

1717
01:07:21.110 --> 01:07:21.741
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

1718
01:07:21.741 --> 01:07:23.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that must've been the one that was the</v>

1719
01:07:23.181 --> 01:07:24.014
<v Speaker 1>guy who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1720
01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:27.290
<v Speaker 1>this is the letter he wrote in the La</v>
<v Speaker 1>Times after he died.</v>

1721
01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:29.550
<v Speaker 1>How has find myself into there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

1722
01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:31.820
<v Speaker 1>He is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's his,</v>

<v Speaker 1>audit.</v>

1724
01:07:35.020 --> 01:07:37.130
<v Speaker 1>Coal is called the porn king and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>preacher.</v>

1725
01:07:38.730 --> 01:07:43.730
<v Speaker 1>Interesting is there the 1997 automatic</v>
<v Speaker 1>biography called an unseemly man.</v>

1726
01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:48.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's hilarious.</v>

1727
01:07:48.750 --> 01:07:51.870
<v Speaker 1>He sued him for $50 million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I went to the Supreme Court.</v>

1728
01:07:51.900 --> 01:07:56.100
<v Speaker 1>He kept losing the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lost repeatedly yet eventually won a</v>

1729
01:07:56.100 --> 01:07:56.701
<v Speaker 1>Supreme Gore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1730
01:07:56.701 --> 01:07:59.400
<v Speaker 1>He kept losing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now he's hugging me in front of millions</v>

1731
01:07:59.401 --> 01:08:01.200
<v Speaker 1>on the Larry King show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

1732
01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:01.910
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1733
01:08:01.910 --> 01:08:03.040
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

1734
01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:07.190
<v Speaker 1>how much it cost him to fight those off</v>
<v Speaker 1>because someone suing you for $50</v>

1735
01:08:07.190 --> 01:08:08.330
<v Speaker 1>million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he lost her repeatedly,</v>

1736
01:08:08.690 --> 01:08:09.523
<v Speaker 1>each one of those things</v>

1737
01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:12.510
<v Speaker 2>it had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>luckily it was the right guy who was</v>

1738
01:08:12.511 --> 01:08:13.650
<v Speaker 2>crazy enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>

1739
01:08:13.651 --> 01:08:16.280
<v Speaker 2>and had the money to fight it because</v>
<v Speaker 2>most people would have just never</v>

1740
01:08:16.820 --> 01:08:19.670
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't have thought at once much less</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the way up to the supreme court.</v>

1741
01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:21.740
<v Speaker 3>It's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1742
01:08:22.460 --> 01:08:24.020
<v Speaker 3>It's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The whole thing is funny.</v>

1743
01:08:25.130 --> 01:08:26.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the real story.</v>

1744
01:08:26.331 --> 01:08:29.070
<v Speaker 3>It's one of those things where the real</v>
<v Speaker 3>stories crazier in the fucking movie.</v>

1745
01:08:29.071 --> 01:08:31.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it's crazy that it's such a pivotal</v>

1746
01:08:31.431 --> 01:08:34.520
<v Speaker 3>moment and free speech history yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you said,</v>

1747
01:08:34.521 --> 01:08:37.700
<v Speaker 3>it's not something anybody ever talks</v>
<v Speaker 3>about that he actually had to go out</v>

1748
01:08:37.701 --> 01:08:40.050
<v Speaker 3>there like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they were saying before they're,</v>

1749
01:08:40.051 --> 01:08:43.160
<v Speaker 3>they're saying snl might not exist if</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was,</v>

1750
01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:45.170
<v Speaker 3>if he had won that case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1751
01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:46.980
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if he can daily showering you that shit.</v>

1752
01:08:46.981 --> 01:08:51.410
<v Speaker 3>If you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you can't parody public figures,</v>

1753
01:08:51.580 --> 01:08:53.840
<v Speaker 3>SNL can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't do the daily show,</v>

1754
01:08:53.870 --> 01:08:55.700
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we could prove that in.</v>

1755
01:08:55.701 --> 01:08:57.650
<v Speaker 3>Here's the way to prove it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's sort of a round about way,</v>

1756
01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:02.800
<v Speaker 3>but marijuana is still illegal in 2016</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of some bullshit propaganda that</v>

1757
01:09:03.831 --> 01:09:08.000
<v Speaker 3>was made in the 1930s so that momentum</v>
<v Speaker 3>carries on,</v>

1758
01:09:08.090 --> 01:09:09.410
<v Speaker 3>even though it doesn't make any sense.</v>

1759
01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:11.420
<v Speaker 3>You could still go to jail today for</v>
<v Speaker 3>growing pot.</v>

1760
01:09:11.540 --> 01:09:14.780
<v Speaker 3>So if you think that if Howard stern</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't have those lawsuits,</v>

1761
01:09:14.781 --> 01:09:17.590
<v Speaker 3>didn't pay all that money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't make this big public outright did</v>

1762
01:09:17.980 --> 01:09:20.870
<v Speaker 3>public outcry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't have to go to Sirius satellite</v>

1763
01:09:20.871 --> 01:09:23.720
<v Speaker 3>radio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If all those things didn't happen and</v>

1764
01:09:23.721 --> 01:09:25.370
<v Speaker 3>they won,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what did they shut him down?</v>

1765
01:09:25.371 --> 01:09:28.910
<v Speaker 3>What if they pulled him off the air with</v>
<v Speaker 3>Larry Larry flynt loss and never fought</v>

1766
01:09:28.911 --> 01:09:32.690
<v Speaker 3>it would have everything buckled down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How long would it take care of the</v>

1767
01:09:32.691 --> 01:09:35.350
<v Speaker 3>Internet to happen?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How would it would have taken forward?</v>

1768
01:09:35.410 --> 01:09:39.890
<v Speaker 3>It have things like reddit or four chan</v>
<v Speaker 3>or these fucking uncensored blogs or</v>

1769
01:09:39.891 --> 01:09:42.320
<v Speaker 3>uncensored youtube content where you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>do whatever you want.</v>

1770
01:09:42.470 --> 01:09:44.420
<v Speaker 3>Vimeo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that shit podcast,</v>

1771
01:09:44.690 --> 01:09:49.490
<v Speaker 3>that ripple from those two guys is like</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the most important ripples for</v>

1772
01:09:49.491 --> 01:09:52.670
<v Speaker 3>free speech media in 2016 and what's one</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the most important,</v>

1773
01:09:52.671 --> 01:09:56.000
<v Speaker 3>like pivotal moments in the history of</v>
<v Speaker 3>free speech and we're talking about</v>

1774
01:09:56.001 --> 01:09:56.630
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1775
01:09:56.630 --> 01:09:59.240
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking crazy and crazy that we're</v>

1776
01:09:59.241 --> 01:10:03.350
<v Speaker 3>talking about an x ray had record that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>own on a podcast that you own.</v>

1777

<v Speaker 3>This wouldn't have been fucking like</v>

1778
01:10:05.781 --> 01:10:07.910
<v Speaker 3>this whole world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The whole thing wouldn't have happened.</v>

1779
01:10:07.911 --> 01:10:09.500
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't be able to do that record</v>
<v Speaker 3>in one way.</v>

1780
01:10:09.570 --> 01:10:11.180
<v Speaker 3>Like he would've found out about it the</v>
<v Speaker 3>bigger,</v>

1781
01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:13.460
<v Speaker 3>even though I make fun of like those</v>

<v Speaker 1>brain works by the way.</v>

1951

<v Speaker 1>Seen her lately.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Was it fun?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fee for at the beginning or know the</v>

1996
01:18:05.511 --> 01:18:07.160

<v Speaker 1>too many days where you wake up,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2002
01:18:15.171 --> 01:18:17.720
<v Speaker 1>Just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially now that we're getting older</v>

2003
01:18:17.721 --> 01:18:20.540
<v Speaker 1>and the younger even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was crazy when they were young.</v>

2004
01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:22.040
<v Speaker 1>We were younger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2005

2008
01:18:28.310 --> 01:18:30.620
<v Speaker 1>one thing that helps is to do it with</v>
<v Speaker 1>people you really like.</v>

2009
01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:31.970
<v Speaker 1>That helps a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

2010
01:18:32.470 --> 01:18:34.730
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of stuff that helps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're still,</v>

2011
01:18:35.330 --> 01:18:37.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're a kid you're just like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>He hasn't tried to do a damn thing.</v>

2046
01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:51.590
<v Speaker 1>They showed the trainer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they showed the jockeys shut the horse,</v>

<v Speaker 3>his day.</v>

2058
01:20:13.351 --> 01:20:13.981
<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll read,</v>

2059
01:20:13.981 --> 01:20:16.230
<v Speaker 3>I'll go fucking Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still think,</v>

2060
01:20:16.231 --> 01:20:18.210
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2061
01:20:18.270 --> 01:20:19.103
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2062
01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:21.510
<v Speaker 3>fear and loathing is one of my favorite</v>
<v Speaker 3>books of all time.</v>

2063
01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:24.420
<v Speaker 3>Fear and loathing is outstanding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you remember when they did that</v>

2064
01:20:24.421 --> 01:20:29.380
<v Speaker 3>thing where Johnny Depp read the passage</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he talked about like the,</v>

2065
01:20:29.381 --> 01:20:34.381
<v Speaker 3>the change that was coming in the 1970s</v>
<v Speaker 3>and how it all pulled back and that he</v>

2066
01:20:34.471 --> 01:20:37.410
<v Speaker 3>saw it all happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he was the perfect guy to</v>

2067
01:20:37.411 --> 01:20:38.120
<v Speaker 3>capture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2068
01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:38.850
<v Speaker 3>in the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the movie,</v>

2069
01:20:38.850 --> 01:20:40.800
<v Speaker 3>it was fucking great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Johnny Depp was the perfect guy.</v>

2070
01:20:40.801 --> 01:20:44.520
<v Speaker 3>But I mean hunter was the perfect guy to</v>
<v Speaker 3>capture because he had been in the 60s</v>

2071
01:20:44.521 --> 01:20:46.800
<v Speaker 3>and Berkeley during the acid times and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2072
01:20:46.801 --> 01:20:49.620
<v Speaker 3>the Timothy leary and the merry</v>
<v Speaker 3>pranksters and all that shit.</v>

2073
01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:52.020
<v Speaker 3>He had been with those guys and the Ken</v>
<v Speaker 3>Keyes.</v>

2074
01:20:52.290 --> 01:20:56.100
<v Speaker 3>And then when it all pulled away and</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody just got locked up and went to</v>

2075
01:20:56.101 --> 01:20:58.320
<v Speaker 3>jail and the war on drugs and all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>things happen,</v>

2076
01:20:58.620 --> 01:21:02.790
<v Speaker 3>he saw this death of the American dream</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he put it so eloquently and then</v>

2077
01:21:02.791 --> 01:21:07.110
<v Speaker 3>Johnny Depp pretending to be him did it</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a scene in that movie.</v>

2078
01:21:07.170 --> 01:21:11.970
<v Speaker 3>And it's fucking sensational wonder too</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it's cause di Johnny Depp's also from</v>

2079
01:21:11.971 --> 01:21:12.631
<v Speaker 3>Kentucky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want,</v>

2080
01:21:12.631 --> 01:21:14.920
<v Speaker 3>it's also a good friend of his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were friends and new,</v>

2081
01:21:15.470 --> 01:21:18.390
<v Speaker 3>if you're starting from the same place</v>
<v Speaker 3>and your friends,</v>

2082
01:21:18.750 --> 01:21:20.370
<v Speaker 3>it Kinda probably seeps into you a</v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit,</v>

2083
01:21:20.371 --> 01:21:22.770
<v Speaker 3>but certainly helps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Johnny stayed with him like when he</v>

2084
01:21:22.771 --> 01:21:25.080
<v Speaker 3>was doing that movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he stayed with them for a long time.</v>

2085
01:21:25.081 --> 01:21:27.540
<v Speaker 3>He lived with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that book is a perfect example of</v>

2086
01:21:27.541 --> 01:21:30.300
<v Speaker 3>like real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just first of all,</v>

2087
01:21:30.301 --> 01:21:31.530
<v Speaker 3>laugh out loud.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Funny Shit,</v>

2088
01:21:31.531 --> 01:21:32.700
<v Speaker 3>the funniest shit you've ever read.</v>

2089
01:21:33.370 --> 01:21:36.250
<v Speaker 3>Dylan's up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But so fucking he can read,</v>

2090
01:21:36.270 --> 01:21:38.280
<v Speaker 3>he goes deep emotionally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You forget,</v>

2091
01:21:38.281 --> 01:21:41.070
<v Speaker 3>he goes fucking deep and that it is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>great book.</v>

2092
01:21:41.490 --> 01:21:44.220
<v Speaker 3>That's his well between that and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

2093
01:21:44.310 --> 01:21:47.790
<v Speaker 3>there's a few things that he wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like small pieces that he wrote to that</v>

2094
01:21:47.791 --> 01:21:50.130
<v Speaker 3>just go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were some pieces right before he</v>

2095
01:21:50.131 --> 01:21:53.700
<v Speaker 3>died that he wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was on espn website that were</v>

2096
01:21:53.701 --> 01:21:57.320
<v Speaker 3>like kind of predicted the whole world</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was going to happen.</v>

2097
01:21:57.570 --> 01:22:00.480
<v Speaker 3>That was when after nine 11 or check out</v>

2100
01:22:03.421 --> 01:22:04.650

<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>he was also like a serious alcoholic to</v>

2103
01:22:08.221 --> 01:22:11.680
<v Speaker 3>the point where when he was almost dead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you couldn't even understand them</v>

<v Speaker 3>weeks after he got a hip replacement and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was walking without a limp and I was</v>

<v Speaker 3>holes.</v>

2135
01:23:17.141 --> 01:23:20.290
<v Speaker 3>Graham,</v>

<v Speaker 3>least.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's in his late fifties and he got a</v>

<v Speaker 3>hip replacement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want an old people used to get,</v>

2142
01:23:32.740 --> 01:23:35.590
<v Speaker 3>When they did it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'd saw off your fucking femur and</v>

2143
01:23:35.591 --> 01:23:40.360
<v Speaker 3>screw a bolt in there and it's like</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a raw that had to go deep in</v>

2144
01:23:40.361 --> 01:23:41.860

<v Speaker 3>without a limp.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I was like a couple of years ago and</v>

2171
01:24:54.161 --> 01:24:55.840
<v Speaker 3>he's an all star is here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's incredible.</v>

2172
01:24:55.860 --> 01:24:57.880
<v Speaker 3>It's like just snapped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But now you know,</v>

2173
01:24:58.290 --> 01:25:01.120
<v Speaker 3>they have all the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this way healing things.</v>

2174
01:25:01.180 --> 01:25:05.350
<v Speaker 3>They use all sorts of different methods</v>
<v Speaker 3>to accelerate healing.</v>

2175
01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:07.090
<v Speaker 3>They just keep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're getting so good at it.</v>

2176
01:25:07.091 --> 01:25:09.850
<v Speaker 3>Doctors are just fucking unbelievable at</v>
<v Speaker 3>it now.</v>

2177
01:25:09.860 --> 01:25:13.350
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's incredible time to be injured and</v>

2178
01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:15.940
<v Speaker 3>if you get injured now they just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they fix you in a way that just wasn't</v>

2179
01:25:15.941 --> 01:25:18.370
<v Speaker 3>available.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I have to replaced acs,</v>

2180
01:25:18.870 --> 01:25:21.820
<v Speaker 3>but I have a buddy of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my friend Steve who was on the ski team,</v>

2181
01:25:21.850 --> 01:25:26.850
<v Speaker 3>the US ski team in the 1980s and he's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>badass skier in the 1980s and his knees</v>

2182
01:25:28.900 --> 01:25:31.450
<v Speaker 3>are devastated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's had,</v>

2183
01:25:31.451 --> 01:25:33.730
<v Speaker 3>and I would actually have to call him to</v>
<v Speaker 3>confirm this,</v>

2184
01:25:33.731 --> 01:25:37.840
<v Speaker 3>but I know he's had more than 20 knee</v>
<v Speaker 3>surgeries after.</v>

2185
01:25:37.870 --> 01:25:40.570
<v Speaker 3>How do you fucking go through an animal?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't give a fuck.</v>

2186
01:25:40.970 --> 01:25:41.651
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2187
01:25:41.651 --> 01:25:44.660
<v Speaker 3>He's in his sixties and still fights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He still goes to gym and spars.</v>

2188
01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:47.350
<v Speaker 3>It's thinking about competing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like going to the fucking</v>

2189
01:25:47.351 --> 01:25:50.230
<v Speaker 3>dentist at that point or getting a</v>
<v Speaker 3>haircut or something.</v>

2190
01:25:50.290 --> 01:25:52.000
<v Speaker 3>He's just an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This guy is just,</v>

2191
01:25:52.060 --> 01:25:57.060
<v Speaker 3>there's certain people that like pain is</v>
<v Speaker 3>a non factor to [inaudible] movement.</v>

2192
01:25:57.880 --> 01:25:59.590
<v Speaker 3>What does that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the well look at it.</v>

2193
01:25:59.591 --> 01:26:03.040
<v Speaker 3>Poking out of the skin right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy that the local guy.</v>

2194
01:26:03.070 --> 01:26:03.903
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2195
01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:05.430
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's hardcore.</v>

2196
01:26:05.450 --> 01:26:07.420
<v Speaker 1>Do you know how hardcore that is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2197
01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:12.620
<v Speaker 1>I felt for the guy and I fucking hate</v>
<v Speaker 1>little so that that means it's serious</v>

2198
01:26:12.621 --> 01:26:15.230
<v Speaker 1>shit that is serious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a tour through the skin</v>

2199
01:26:15.231 --> 01:26:18.800
<v Speaker 1>and all the muscle and everything too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that is a serious trauma that</v>

2200
01:26:18.801 --> 01:26:20.300
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was live on television.</v>

2201
01:26:20.420 --> 01:26:21.970
<v Speaker 1>They were worried about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2202
01:26:22.010 --> 01:26:23.300
<v Speaker 1>with uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the octagon,</v>

2203
01:26:23.330 --> 01:26:24.680
<v Speaker 1>they're worried about that ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>

2204
01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:28.310
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only breaks we've seen on legs and arms</v>

2205
01:26:28.311 --> 01:26:30.740
<v Speaker 1>have been non compound breaks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think when it happens,</v>

2206
01:26:30.741 --> 01:26:33.980
<v Speaker 1>like that guy just had it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes more problematic because when</v>

2207
01:26:33.981 --> 01:26:35.750
<v Speaker 1>it breaks the skin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have all this possibility for</v>

2208
01:26:35.751 --> 01:26:37.700
<v Speaker 1>infection that exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gets real bad.</v>

2209
01:26:37.730 --> 01:26:38.563
<v Speaker 1>Well I remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2210
01:26:39.140 --> 01:26:42.320
<v Speaker 1>them really fast going over there with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>towel and covering it up cause it was on</v>

2211
01:26:42.321 --> 01:26:43.700
<v Speaker 1>live TV and they covered it up.</v>

2212
01:26:43.730 --> 01:26:45.110
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh that's cause they didn't want people</v>

2213
01:26:45.111 --> 01:26:46.000
<v Speaker 1>to see it probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2214
01:26:46.070 --> 01:26:46.791
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm saying.</v>

2215
01:26:46.791 --> 01:26:48.050
<v Speaker 1>It's like the first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2216
01:26:48.230 --> 01:26:51.740
<v Speaker 1>we live in a world where the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>reaction was get this shit off TV.</v>

2217
01:26:51.741 --> 01:26:54.230
<v Speaker 1>But yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why not go to fucking commercial?</v>

2218
01:26:54.440 --> 01:26:59.440
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't it funny man that like movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's every big action movie that you</v>

2219
01:26:59.541 --> 01:27:02.120
<v Speaker 1>go to Wa watch somebody die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every one of them.</v>

2220
01:27:02.190 --> 01:27:03.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's no big deal.</v>

2221
01:27:03.141 --> 01:27:04.040
<v Speaker 1>But people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

2222
01:27:04.490 --> 01:27:06.530
<v Speaker 1>it becomes a disgrace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a real problem.</v>

2223
01:27:06.590 --> 01:27:09.260
<v Speaker 1>It's a disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you have to remember that Brown</v>

2224
01:27:09.261 --> 01:27:11.900
<v Speaker 1>bunny movie where Vincent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the flux is,</v>

2225
01:27:11.901 --> 01:27:12.850
<v Speaker 1>Miss Gallo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2226
01:27:12.950 --> 01:27:14.960
<v Speaker 1>He had a movie where the chloe's</v>
<v Speaker 1>Virginia.</v>

2227
01:27:14.961 --> 01:27:17.810
<v Speaker 1>Did she fucking suck his Dick in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie?</v>

2228
01:27:17.840 --> 01:27:18.710
<v Speaker 1>It's already,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I saw it.</v>

2229
01:27:18.950 --> 01:27:20.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the only reason why I started to,</v>

2230
01:27:20.520 --> 01:27:22.430
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seemed like that whole movie was just</v>

2231
01:27:22.431 --> 01:27:23.860
<v Speaker 1>like getting to the blowjob.</v>

2232
01:27:24.020 --> 01:27:24.831
<v Speaker 1>Like I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

2233
01:27:24.831 --> 01:27:26.090
<v Speaker 1>blah blah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's get,</v>

2234
01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:29.390
<v Speaker 1>let's cut the walk to the scene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I can go home and get on a fucking</v>

2235
01:27:29.391 --> 01:27:31.250
<v Speaker 1>website in two seconds and see all that</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

2236
01:27:31.300 --> 01:27:36.300
<v Speaker 1>Well I think his idea was why can't we</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a real sex scene?</v>

2237
01:27:36.381 --> 01:27:41.240
<v Speaker 1>Like if you can have like people kissing</v>
<v Speaker 1>for real and rubbing each other for real</v>

2238
01:27:41.241 --> 01:27:43.610
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know intellectually that they're</v>

2239
01:27:43.611 --> 01:27:47.420
<v Speaker 1>not actually having sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's supposed to be a sex scene.</v>

2240
01:27:47.630 --> 01:27:50.990
<v Speaker 1>So if you have these two people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vincent Gallo and chloe's suffocating</v>

2241
01:27:50.991 --> 01:27:54.350
<v Speaker 1>doing and that are adults and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>agree,</v>

2242
01:27:54.500 --> 01:27:57.350
<v Speaker 1>they agree like I think you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>attractive or I'm willing to do this or</v>

2243
01:27:57.351 --> 01:27:59.000
<v Speaker 1>I think it'd be cool to do this in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>film.</v>

2244
01:27:59.300 --> 01:28:02.030
<v Speaker 1>I want to actually give you head in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>

2245
01:28:02.180 --> 01:28:04.400
<v Speaker 1>Why is that bad?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was real.</v>

2246
01:28:04.430 --> 01:28:06.440
<v Speaker 1>It was 100% really came on her face and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

2247
01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:10.070
<v Speaker 1>Like she sucked his dick like a champ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Outstanding.</v>

2248
01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:14.000
<v Speaker 1>It just put boat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird that it be like we all,</v>

2249
01:28:14.270 --> 01:28:16.070
<v Speaker 1>everybody I assume has gotten their Dick</v>
<v Speaker 1>sock.</v>

2250
01:28:16.130 --> 01:28:17.390
<v Speaker 1>I assume.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you haven't,</v>

2251
01:28:17.391 --> 01:28:20.340
<v Speaker 1>I feel so bad for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you haven't put out a fucking record,</v>

2252
01:28:20.341 --> 01:28:23.750
<v Speaker 1>let my man nonstop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens.</v>

2253
01:28:23.751 --> 01:28:24.900
<v Speaker 1>It's nonstop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dick Second.</v>

2254
01:28:25.070 --> 01:28:27.740
<v Speaker 1>I can't even put,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish I had fucking two dicks right</v>

2255
01:28:27.741 --> 01:28:30.050
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What'd you did that video for?</v>

2256
01:28:30.051 --> 01:28:33.760
<v Speaker 1>A eating pussy and sucking dick or even</v>
<v Speaker 1>pussy and kicking ass.</v>

2257
01:28:33.780 --> 01:28:35.810
<v Speaker 1>Sandik doesn't come into that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That comes through to the end.</v>

2258
01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:37.820
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that audience,</v>

2259
01:28:37.850 --> 01:28:40.490
<v Speaker 1>what was going on there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did they have the ideal?</v>

2260
01:28:40.491 --> 01:28:42.710
<v Speaker 1>It's told,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because I got kind of thrown,</v>

2261
01:28:42.890 --> 01:28:44.870
<v Speaker 1>they told just an audience that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to to get here,</v>

2262
01:28:44.871 --> 01:28:48.290
<v Speaker 1>like you're just going to watch a real</v>
<v Speaker 1>country guy just in country.</v>

2263
01:28:48.291 --> 01:28:49.610
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that they had told them</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2264
01:28:49.700 --> 01:28:51.510
<v Speaker 1>but there was only like 15 people in</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

2265
01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:53.990
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like there was a more like 150,</v>

2266
01:28:53.991 --> 01:28:56.120
<v Speaker 1>a hundred and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so they were just waiting for a</v>

2267
01:28:56.121 --> 01:28:57.560
<v Speaker 1>country song,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I find out later.</v>

2268
01:28:57.561 --> 01:29:00.560
<v Speaker 1>And then when I got to even the eating</v>
<v Speaker 1>pussy,</v>

2269
01:29:00.561 --> 01:29:02.400
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their faces fucking dropped.</v>

2270
01:29:02.401 --> 01:29:03.960
<v Speaker 1>I knew I was and this is not my best</v>
<v Speaker 1>gig.</v>

2271
01:29:04.350 --> 01:29:07.290
<v Speaker 1>And then I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got to get to the,</v>

2272
01:29:07.560 --> 01:29:08.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Dick Suck,</v>

2273
01:29:08.810 --> 01:29:11.880
<v Speaker 1>which is going to ramp it up a notch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2274
01:29:13.170 --> 01:29:16.200
<v Speaker 1>then I think a couple people walked out</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like weren't too happy.</v>

2275
01:29:16.201 --> 01:29:18.810
<v Speaker 1>But I'll tell you what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one for the ages.</v>

2276
01:29:18.811 --> 01:29:20.940
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got the shit out there.</v>

2277
01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:23.310
<v Speaker 1>I was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody yelled anything out like nobody</v>

2278
01:29:23.311 --> 01:29:24.960

<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone told me that they were at,</v>

2280
01:29:27.370 --> 01:29:29.240
<v Speaker 1>I think they were extra,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I think they probably lost.</v>

2281
01:29:29.700 --> 01:29:31.120
<v Speaker 1>Oh you probably would have knocked.</v>

2282
01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:34.770

<v Speaker 1>that's why you need that second voice.</v>

2741
01:49:18.041 --> 01:49:20.140
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes that shit is a good one too.</v>

2742
01:49:20.140 --> 01:49:23.680
<v Speaker 1>It's like a good introduction song to</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing and having that be the</v>

2743
01:49:23.681 --> 01:49:26.860
<v Speaker 1>first song of smart because if someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>listens to that then they'll get hooked</v>

2744
01:49:26.861 --> 01:49:29.250
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then by the time they get to eat and</v>

2745
01:49:29.251 --> 01:49:31.270
<v Speaker 1>pussy kicking ass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're already in.</v>

2746
01:49:31.271 --> 01:49:34.180
<v Speaker 1>Well that's what I've noticed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look on itunes later,</v>

2747
01:49:34.181 --> 01:49:37.420
<v Speaker 1>like every fucking country record on</v>
<v Speaker 1>itunes,</v>

2748
01:49:37.421 --> 01:49:40.150
<v Speaker 1>it's all five stars because everyone who</v>
<v Speaker 1>buys it on the ratings,</v>

2749
01:49:40.151 --> 01:49:41.350
<v Speaker 1>they all buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know what they're getting,</v>

2750
01:49:41.351 --> 01:49:43.300
<v Speaker 1>they love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the only one on there,</v>

2751
01:49:43.330 --> 01:49:46.240
<v Speaker 1>like literally it's five stars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one star or five stars.</v>

2752
01:49:47.750 --> 01:49:48.010
<v Speaker 1>And I</v>

2753
01:49:48.010 --> 01:49:49.720
<v Speaker 2>promise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause it's like this is not what country</v>

2754
01:49:49.721 --> 01:49:50.411
<v Speaker 2>means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're supposed to be,</v>

2755
01:49:50.411 --> 01:49:52.280
<v Speaker 2>you can't curse in country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2756
01:49:52.650 --> 01:49:55.360
<v Speaker 2>and I'm telling you right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those one star fuckers are selling my</v>

2757
01:49:55.361 --> 01:49:59.520
<v Speaker 2>album way more than the five star cars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're telling what was like from that</v>

2758
01:49:59.680 --> 01:50:00.520
<v Speaker 2>private parts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2759
01:50:00.521 --> 01:50:04.510
<v Speaker 2>it's like the f I'm paraphrasing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the five star people are telling</v>

2760
01:50:04.511 --> 01:50:05.810
<v Speaker 2>three friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one start,</v>

2761
01:50:05.811 --> 01:50:07.590
<v Speaker 2>people are telling 20 friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2762
01:50:07.591 --> 01:50:10.660
<v Speaker 2>and they're the ones getting the word</v>
<v Speaker 2>out because I don't know why they think</v>

2763
01:50:10.661 --> 01:50:15.100
<v Speaker 2>it's so no one I love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love country music so much,</v>

2764
01:50:15.101 --> 01:50:17.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and those are my heroes so much that I</v>

2765
01:50:17.951 --> 01:50:22.060
<v Speaker 2>hate to see what's happening to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then those fuckers who listened to</v>

2766
01:50:22.061 --> 01:50:26.890
<v Speaker 2>this dog shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking pop rap garbage are yelling at</v>

2767

01:50:30.820 --> 01:50:32.470
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't like I can,</v>

2770
01:50:32.500 --> 01:50:34.300

<v Speaker 2>you know that's fine.</v>

2771
01:50:34.330 --> 01:50:35.620
<v Speaker 2>That's has nothing to do with what I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

2772
01:50:35.770 --> 01:50:40.630
<v Speaker 2>But if you think that it's legit because</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm cursing or talking about fucking</v>

2773

<v Speaker 2>Or like there's family trees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a song about a girl that I liked your</v>

<v Speaker 2>But then of course I take it a step</v>

2778
01:50:54.011 --> 01:50:55.030
<v Speaker 2>further.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

01:51:02.531 --> 01:51:04.900

<v Speaker 2>but just funny to think about it.</v>

2784
01:51:05.190 --> 01:51:08.690
<v Speaker 2>Then you go over toward the song and of</v>
<v Speaker 2>course you know the players and I was</v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a song on here called can't</v>

<v Speaker 2>used to say,</v>

2790
01:51:19.931 --> 01:51:22.150
<v Speaker 2>and now it's like you've been through</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2791
01:51:22.780 --> 01:51:24.880
<v Speaker 2>Everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone's had a heartbreak,</v>

2792
01:51:25.120 --> 01:51:27.160
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you try to fuck some other girls to</v>

2793
01:51:27.161 --> 01:51:29.200
<v Speaker 2>get over it and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all you're doing is thinking about the</v>

2794
01:51:29.201 --> 01:51:33.550
<v Speaker 2>first girl I tried to fuck a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 2>girls and it never works it to know what</v>

2795
01:51:33.551 --> 01:51:36.160
<v Speaker 2>else could works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to fuck the right girls.</v>

2796
01:51:36.190 --> 01:51:38.260
<v Speaker 2>Well I fucked the wrong ones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you fucked the right ones.</v>

2797
01:51:38.261 --> 01:51:40.150
<v Speaker 2>You don't even care about the other one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you,</v>

2798
01:51:40.151 --> 01:51:43.000
<v Speaker 2>but don't you think that's something</v>
<v Speaker 2>people can relate to at the very least.</v>

2799
01:51:43.180 --> 01:51:46.000
<v Speaker 2>So they can't sing about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the other thing too is one</v>

2800
01:51:46.570 --> 01:51:49.040
<v Speaker 2>mainstream press,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially except for a few places</v>

2801
01:51:49.070 --> 01:51:51.700
<v Speaker 2>pretty much like there's no reviews of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it really anywhere.</v>

2802
01:51:51.970 --> 01:51:54.040
<v Speaker 2>But one guy wrote a review.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was pretty interesting.</v>

2803
01:51:54.041 --> 01:51:57.340
<v Speaker 2>He actually used that [inaudible]</v>
<v Speaker 2>Florida Georgia line as an example.</v>

2804
01:51:57.790 --> 01:52:00.160
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish I could remember who it was.</v>

2805
01:52:00.161 --> 01:52:03.700
<v Speaker 2>It might've been a blog called state and</v>
<v Speaker 2>country music.</v>

2806
01:52:03.701 --> 01:52:06.670
<v Speaker 2>I think it's what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they use an example of a floor of</v>

2807
01:52:06.671 --> 01:52:10.450
<v Speaker 2>Georgia line lyric that was like in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were talking about sticking my pink</v>

2808
01:52:10.451 --> 01:52:14.020
<v Speaker 2>and your stride was like kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking.</v>

2809
01:52:14.021 --> 01:52:16.960
<v Speaker 2>He was saying the article about how like</v>
<v Speaker 2>these mainstream guys who talked this</v>

2810
01:52:16.961 --> 01:52:20.980
<v Speaker 2>dirty shit but co sugarcoat it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>little girls are hearing it.</v>

2811
01:52:21.400 --> 01:52:23.550
<v Speaker 2>What did they say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know exactly what,</v>

2812
01:52:23.560 --> 01:52:26.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the actual lyric but it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of gross.</v>

2813
01:52:26.051 --> 01:52:27.940
<v Speaker 2>But that they do that to have it</v>
<v Speaker 2>censored.</v>

2814
01:52:28.420 --> 01:52:30.280
<v Speaker 2>Kevin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not to have it be played on the radio so</v>

2815
01:52:30.281 --> 01:52:32.590
<v Speaker 2>they can make money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what I'm doing as much better,</v>

2816
01:52:32.591 --> 01:52:35.830
<v Speaker 2>because I'm saying this is for adults,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the CD,</v>

2817
01:52:35.910 --> 01:52:38.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean the CD and the online has the</v>
<v Speaker 2>sticker on it.</v>

2818
01:52:38.440 --> 01:52:39.300
<v Speaker 2>Adults,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2819

<v Speaker 2>They're the ones trying to give it to</v>

2821
01:52:43.631 --> 01:52:44.890
<v Speaker 2>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is for adults.</v>

2822
01:52:44.891 --> 01:52:46.220

01:57:47.911 --> 01:57:52.110
<v Speaker 1>fuck those folks can get too many beam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be Joe Rogan only soon.</v>

2968
01:57:52.111 --> 01:57:53.960
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of other cool ones you've</v>

2969
01:57:53.961 --> 01:57:57.930
<v Speaker 1>got to do like Bert Kreischer and do as</v>
<v Speaker 1>many people as you can around town.</v>

2970
01:57:58.110 --> 01:57:59.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While I'm here and not playing</v>

2971
01:57:59.161 --> 01:58:00.600
<v Speaker 1>Coachella,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I may as well do the whole fucking</v>

2972
01:58:00.601 --> 01:58:01.800
<v Speaker 1>round.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hilarious.</v>

2973
01:58:01.801 --> 01:58:03.390
<v Speaker 1>At coachella.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thought you were too risky.</v>

2974
01:58:03.780 --> 01:58:05.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would love to see you up there.</v>

2975
01:58:05.341 --> 01:58:06.150
<v Speaker 1>You won't push.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2976
01:58:06.150 --> 01:58:08.220
<v Speaker 1>I think it is kicking in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think part of it is,</v>

2977
01:58:08.850 --> 01:58:11.700
<v Speaker 1>it's like in the kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's cause it's country and it's</v>

2978
01:58:11.701 --> 01:58:12.750
<v Speaker 1>just so weird to hear.</v>

2979
01:58:12.780 --> 01:58:15.710
<v Speaker 1>And also when it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not as loud so that every,</v>

2980
01:58:15.750 --> 01:58:18.980
<v Speaker 1>all the bad words are so fucking clear</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can hear it so well.</v>

2981
01:58:19.340 --> 01:58:21.780
<v Speaker 1>Like when you sync clip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can really hear it.</v>

2982
01:58:21.810 --> 01:58:25.140
<v Speaker 1>I just would love to see all those</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking hipsters that are just going to,</v>

2983
01:58:25.141 --> 01:58:27.060
<v Speaker 1>the cool thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like people were like,</v>

2984
01:58:27.061 --> 01:58:28.440
<v Speaker 1>we're here for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cool thing was I was going to</v>

2985
01:58:28.450 --> 01:58:29.640
<v Speaker 1>Coachella.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>

2986
01:58:30.540 --> 01:58:32.310
<v Speaker 1>that's the whole fuck that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2987
01:58:32.370 --> 01:58:33.990
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's funny you brought that up.</v>

2988
01:58:35.430 --> 01:58:36.101
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but seriously,</v>

2989
01:58:36.101 --> 01:58:37.380
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad you brought that up because</v>

2990
01:58:37.381 --> 01:58:40.680
<v Speaker 1>part of the point of this record to was</v>
<v Speaker 1>to piss off everybody.</v>

2991
01:58:40.681 --> 01:58:41.920
<v Speaker 1>I want it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2992
01:58:42.010 --> 01:58:45.160
<v Speaker 2>my redneck friends back home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted them to get pissed off by this.</v>

2993
01:58:45.250 --> 01:58:47.080
<v Speaker 2>I wanted the hipsters to get pissed off</v>
<v Speaker 2>by,</v>

2994
01:58:47.090 --> 01:58:47.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2995
01:58:47.500 --> 01:58:49.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's something to piss off</v>

2996
01:58:49.151 --> 01:58:49.990
<v Speaker 2>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2997
01:58:49.991 --> 01:58:53.230
<v Speaker 2>So the goal was again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about thinking no one's gonna</v>

2998
01:58:53.231 --> 01:58:55.270
<v Speaker 2>hear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The goal was to fucking make sure nobody</v>

2999
01:58:55.271 --> 01:58:57.880
<v Speaker 2>bought it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did everything in my power to make</v>

3000
01:58:57.881 --> 01:59:00.590
<v Speaker 2>sure no one would listen to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think yes,</v>

3001
01:59:01.940 --> 01:59:03.210
<v Speaker 2>the key,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3002
01:59:03.211 --> 01:59:05.320
<v Speaker 2>cause there's something to piss off</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone on here.</v>

3003
01:59:05.460 --> 01:59:07.110
<v Speaker 3>What's this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a hilarious idea.</v>

3004
01:59:07.170 --> 01:59:08.640
<v Speaker 3>The whole idea behind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's Hilarious,</v>

3005
01:59:09.400 --> 01:59:10.350
<v Speaker 3>but I think people get it</v>

3006
01:59:10.380 --> 01:59:11.250
<v Speaker 2>that it's re,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3007
01:59:11.940 --> 01:59:14.010
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't make music like this.</v>

3008
01:59:14.011 --> 01:59:16.310
<v Speaker 2>That sounds like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's not coming from a real fucking</v>

3009
01:59:17.130 --> 01:59:17.963
<v Speaker 3>place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3010
01:59:18.030 --> 01:59:18.990
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3011
01:59:19.020 --> 01:59:19.610
<v Speaker 3>I'm going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3012
01:59:19.610 --> 01:59:21.590
<v Speaker 3>and I think this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this kind of stuff on,</v>

3013
01:59:21.591 --> 01:59:22.780
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to sound grander,</v>

3014
01:59:22.800 --> 01:59:24.870
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think this ushers in the future,</v>

3015
01:59:25.260 --> 01:59:30.260
<v Speaker 3>because it's proving</v>
<v Speaker 3>people like a lot of stuff that you're</v>

3016
01:59:31.051 --> 01:59:33.480
<v Speaker 3>not going to get it from these</v>
<v Speaker 3>mainstream purveyors.</v>

3017
01:59:33.600 --> 01:59:36.090
<v Speaker 3>You're just not going to get it from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>not going to risk it.</v>

3018
01:59:36.150 --> 01:59:38.250
<v Speaker 3>They're not going to put the money out</v>
<v Speaker 3>for something like this because they</v>

3019
01:59:38.251 --> 01:59:41.460
<v Speaker 3>can't sell it to the radio stations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can't do what they normally do.</v>

3020
01:59:41.461 --> 01:59:43.140
<v Speaker 3>They don't have a place for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't know what it is.</v>

3021
01:59:43.230 --> 01:59:45.000
<v Speaker 3>So then you come along and you do it on</v>
<v Speaker 3>your own.</v>

3022
01:59:45.120 --> 01:59:49.080
<v Speaker 3>It takes off like a fucking wildfire and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that now they're scrambling.</v>

3023
01:59:49.200 --> 01:59:53.130
<v Speaker 3>Like you must be getting a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>mainstream music producer guys and</v>

3024
01:59:53.131 --> 01:59:55.500
<v Speaker 3>executives that are coming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You trying to get in on this.</v>

3025
01:59:55.660 --> 01:59:56.291
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>totally.</v>

3026
01:59:56.291 --> 01:59:57.400
<v Speaker 2>And I tell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

3027
01:59:57.850 --> 02:00:01.390
<v Speaker 2>You always got to remember what the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we talking about,</v>

3028
02:00:01.391 --> 02:00:03.040
<v Speaker 2>don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to keep that attitude.</v>

3029
02:00:03.041 --> 02:00:06.570
<v Speaker 2>Or you're going to fall down the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>drag you into the fucking the dental</v>

3030
02:00:06.590 --> 02:00:08.050
<v Speaker 2>staff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is going to be like,</v>

3031
02:00:08.420 --> 02:00:09.760
<v Speaker 2>and listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like money.</v>

3032
02:00:09.790 --> 02:00:11.350
<v Speaker 2>We all like money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're going to go,</v>

3033
02:00:11.351 --> 02:00:13.990
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you tone down a little on the next</v>

3034
02:00:13.991 --> 02:00:15.490
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can get you on whatever.</v>

3035
02:00:15.491 --> 02:00:18.070
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can get you on MTV or cnt or whatever</v>

3036
02:00:18.071 --> 02:00:20.170
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I'll go and then like,</v>

3037
02:00:20.171 --> 02:00:22.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that'll be 10 times the money and then</v>

3038
02:00:22.600 --> 02:00:24.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll think about it.</v>

3039
02:00:24.161 --> 02:00:26.140
<v Speaker 2>Don't get me wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just got to stick with,</v>

3040
02:00:27.020 --> 02:00:28.790
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I don't think they're wrong though,</v>

3041
02:00:28.880 --> 02:00:30.650
<v Speaker 3>they might.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might be 10 times the money right</v>

3042
02:00:30.651 --> 02:00:33.710
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think in the future this is going</v>

3043
02:00:33.711 --> 02:00:35.900
<v Speaker 3>to be giant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't give a fucking shit if it</v>

3044
02:00:35.930 --> 02:00:39.350
<v Speaker 3>doesn't beat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's good it because if I'm not</v>

3045
02:00:39.351 --> 02:00:41.090
<v Speaker 3>doing it the way I want it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I'll be miserable.</v>

3046
02:00:41.150 --> 02:00:42.770
<v Speaker 3>But because you are doing it the way you</v>
<v Speaker 3>want it,</v>

3047
02:00:42.800 --> 02:00:44.810
<v Speaker 3>it's fucking hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like what,</v>

3048
02:00:44.840 --> 02:00:46.370
<v Speaker 3>what kind of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to name names,</v>

3049
02:00:46.371 --> 02:00:49.580
<v Speaker 3>but like what kind of people have come</v>
<v Speaker 3>up to you and tried to get in on this?</v>

3050
02:00:49.820 --> 02:00:53.000
<v Speaker 3>What kind of music?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Executive type characters</v>

3051
02:00:53.490 --> 02:00:55.770
<v Speaker 2>I'll say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm talking about country stars and</v>

3052
02:00:55.771 --> 02:00:59.070

<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3054

<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to name names but I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about the biggest stars in</v>

3055

<v Speaker 2>I've heard through the grapevine cause I</v>

3057
02:01:11.971 --> 02:01:13.620
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't travel in those circles,</v>

3058
02:01:13.980 --> 02:01:15.840
<v Speaker 2>but some people who really love it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people,</v>

3059
02:01:16.470 --> 02:01:20.010
<v Speaker 2>some people are not untrue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joke have reached out to friends of mine</v>

3060
02:01:20.011 --> 02:01:24.240
<v Speaker 2>who know me making sure that I don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit on that because I talk shit about</v>

<v Speaker 2>everybody and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't you tell him I'm cool because</v>

3062

<v Speaker 2>it wasn't shit on me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a couple of people have come up with</v>

<v Speaker 2>things that wouldn't even my name but</v>

3064
02:01:33.510 --> 02:01:36.840
<v Speaker 2>they don't want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's funny too cause I have some fans</v>

3065
02:01:36.841 --> 02:01:40.130
<v Speaker 2>who are literally the biggest country</v>
<v Speaker 2>stars on planet who won't</v>

3066
02:01:41.360 --> 02:01:44.810
<v Speaker 1>say that there until it becomes okay to</v>
<v Speaker 1>say it.</v>

3067
02:01:44.811 --> 02:01:46.610
<v Speaker 1>They're not saying it right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said it to my face.</v>

3068
02:01:46.611 --> 02:01:48.290
<v Speaker 1>I've literally met them and they've said</v>
<v Speaker 1>it to my face,</v>

3069
02:01:48.470 --> 02:01:52.910
<v Speaker 1>but they won't say it anywhere because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to lose their fucking</v>

3070
02:01:53.750 --> 02:01:54.950
<v Speaker 1>fans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like once it becomes,</v>

3071
02:01:54.951 --> 02:01:57.020
<v Speaker 1>if it becomes mainstream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I hope it doesn't,</v>

3072
02:01:57.230 --> 02:02:00.410
<v Speaker 1>but if it does maybe it will be cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what's mainstream though?</v>

3073
02:02:00.411 --> 02:02:02.810
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no mainstream anymore.</v>

3074
02:02:02.811 --> 02:02:04.610
<v Speaker 1>Mainstream used to be radio and</v>
<v Speaker 1>television.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3079
02:02:12.891 --> 02:02:15.290
<v Speaker 1>because one thing you do is play late</v>
<v Speaker 1>night shows and they're like they ain't</v>

3080
02:02:15.291 --> 02:02:15.951
<v Speaker 1>going to have you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3081
02:02:15.951 --> 02:02:17.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did they mean?</v>

3082
02:02:17.270 --> 02:02:19.940
<v Speaker 1>Anything anymore now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It used to be if you did like the</v>

3083
02:02:19.941 --> 02:02:24.050
<v Speaker 1>tonight show like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then once it changed in like the</v>

3084
02:02:24.050 --> 02:02:27.470
<v Speaker 1>nineties like it started going away and</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the 90s and the two thousands they</v>

3085
02:02:27.471 --> 02:02:29.080
<v Speaker 1>were telling me that the numbers that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are even,</v>

3086
02:02:29.120 --> 02:02:30.770
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't do obviously those big</v>

3087
02:02:30.771 --> 02:02:32.510
<v Speaker 1>talkers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're saying you don't fucking,</v>

3088
02:02:32.570 --> 02:02:34.490
<v Speaker 1>those numbers don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I'm moving the needle.</v>

3089
02:02:34.910 --> 02:02:38.180
<v Speaker 1>It's better than your podcasts going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>move to need a lot more than any fucking</v>

3090
02:02:38.181 --> 02:02:39.320
<v Speaker 1>talk show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you that.</v>

3091
02:02:39.350 --> 02:02:41.000
<v Speaker 1>That's bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3092
02:02:41.030 --> 02:02:41.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3093
02:02:41.440 --> 02:02:42.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope I'm right,</v>

3094
02:02:42.831 --> 02:02:43.820
<v Speaker 1>but I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3095
02:02:43.821 --> 02:02:46.290
<v Speaker 1>but I'm almost positive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard it about books and other people</v>

3096
02:02:46.291 --> 02:02:48.800
<v Speaker 1>see positive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm positive.</v>

3097
02:02:48.801 --> 02:02:50.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I sterns play it a couple times,</v>

3098
02:02:50.781 --> 02:02:53.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that shit so much bigger than doing</v>

3099
02:02:53.061 --> 02:02:57.200
<v Speaker 1>a fucking a tonight show or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever those shows are,</v>

3100
02:02:57.290 --> 02:02:57.950
<v Speaker 1>which is enough.</v>

3101
02:02:57.950 --> 02:02:59.300
<v Speaker 1>I mind if I'm in town,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want me to play,</v>

3102
02:02:59.301 --> 02:03:01.370
<v Speaker 1>I'll do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they can't have me on.</v>

3103
02:03:01.460 --> 02:03:03.140
<v Speaker 1>So it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't have you on.</v>

3104
02:03:03.141 --> 02:03:05.570
<v Speaker 1>And one of the problems with those shows</v>
<v Speaker 1>is like say you know,</v>

3105
02:03:05.600 --> 02:03:08.900
<v Speaker 1>no offense to any of these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but say if Konan has someone on a show</v>

3106
02:03:08.901 --> 02:03:12.380
<v Speaker 1>that's a band,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how much input Konan has or</v>

3107
02:03:12.381 --> 02:03:14.810
<v Speaker 1>like maybe the tonight show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy Fallon.</v>

3108
02:03:14.811 --> 02:03:17.060
<v Speaker 1>How much input does he have on what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>guests are?</v>

3109
02:03:17.090 --> 02:03:19.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I letterman I was told was the one who</v>

3110
02:03:19.251 --> 02:03:21.590
<v Speaker 1>really did like was like real country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

3111
02:03:22.400 --> 02:03:23.900
<v Speaker 1>that was always the place where like</v>
<v Speaker 1>actual,</v>

3112
02:03:23.901 --> 02:03:27.140
<v Speaker 1>like Isabel played there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know like he would,</v>

3113
02:03:27.590 --> 02:03:29.570
<v Speaker 1>and Jason Isbell also is on an</v>
<v Speaker 1>independent label,</v>

3114
02:03:29.571 --> 02:03:31.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's hard for him to get on.</v>

3115
02:03:31.011 --> 02:03:33.530
<v Speaker 1>But with letterman given the approval,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3116
02:03:33.531 --> 02:03:34.240
<v Speaker 1>he can get on it.</v>

3117
02:03:34.240 --> 02:03:36.340
<v Speaker 1>So some of those guys have like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people,</v>

3118
02:03:36.341 --> 02:03:38.180
<v Speaker 1>like Jay Leno was talking to me about</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

3119
02:03:38.181 --> 02:03:41.330
<v Speaker 1>like that he hated when he was doing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>tonight show and you'd have to have some</v>

3120
02:03:41.331 --> 02:03:44.900
<v Speaker 1>guy on from some TV show that he didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>give a fuck about and he had to pretend</v>

3121
02:03:44.901 --> 02:03:47.060
<v Speaker 1>that we care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd think he'd be in a position to</v>

3122
02:03:47.061 --> 02:03:50.960
<v Speaker 1>fucking wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was doing the most mainstream shows.</v>

3123
02:03:50.961 --> 02:03:53.240
<v Speaker 1>But that's why is because it was so</v>
<v Speaker 1>mainstream.</v>

3124
02:03:53.241 --> 02:03:55.670
<v Speaker 1>He had to be like right down the middle</v>
<v Speaker 1>like non-offensive.</v>

3125
02:03:55.910 --> 02:03:59.020
<v Speaker 1>But now he's doing his own show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's doing that Jay Leno's garage.</v>

3126
02:03:59.021 --> 02:03:59.920
<v Speaker 1>If you ever seen that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3127
02:03:59.921 --> 02:04:01.760
<v Speaker 1>Is it good?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get to see what Jay was like.</v>

3128
02:04:01.820 --> 02:04:04.730
<v Speaker 1>Jay Leno's no weird on my TV for 20</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

3129
02:04:04.731 --> 02:04:06.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what he's like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a great guy.</v>

3130
02:04:06.650 --> 02:04:08.570
<v Speaker 1>He was in here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did a podcast with us.</v>

3131
02:04:08.570 --> 02:04:13.250
<v Speaker 1>He was fucking here talking about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing a show for the mob and he was</v>

3132
02:04:13.520 --> 02:04:17.530
<v Speaker 1>talking about his mom heard about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leno screamed you fucking Cock sucker.</v>

3133
02:04:17.670 --> 02:04:20.540
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's bizarre like seeing him scream you</v>

3134
02:04:20.541 --> 02:04:21.740
<v Speaker 1>fucking cock sucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3135
02:04:21.860 --> 02:04:23.750
<v Speaker 1>oh I remember hearing stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3136
02:04:23.751 --> 02:04:26.150
<v Speaker 1>cause I obviously got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of my friends are musicians like</v>

3137
02:04:26.151 --> 02:04:28.040
<v Speaker 1>who they'll be playing a show and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

3138
02:04:28.100 --> 02:04:30.080
<v Speaker 1>oh somebody canceled on the t is years</v>
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>

3139
02:04:30.110 --> 02:04:33.560
<v Speaker 1>Cancel on the tonight show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can get out to la.</v>

3140
02:04:33.561 --> 02:04:36.200
<v Speaker 1>He played tonight show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do the show in whatever.</v>

3141
02:04:36.350 --> 02:04:37.950
<v Speaker 1>And they crunched the numbers and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>costs,</v>

3142
02:04:38.750 --> 02:04:42.510
<v Speaker 1>it's not moving in a band.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so expensive.</v>

3143
02:04:43.200 --> 02:04:46.620
<v Speaker 1>And they crunched the numbers and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it wasn't worth their money to</v>

3144
02:04:46.621 --> 02:04:48.120
<v Speaker 1>play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how fucking crazy is that?</v>

3145
02:04:48.270 --> 02:04:50.040
<v Speaker 1>That's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we become a band,</v>

3146
02:04:50.041 --> 02:04:52.380
<v Speaker 1>a small band,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's not worth the money to play.</v>

3147
02:04:52.380 --> 02:04:56.390
<v Speaker 1>The tonight show won't get enough return</v>
<v Speaker 1>on your money and far as far as they</v>

3148
02:04:56.400 --> 02:05:00.120
<v Speaker 1>were saying that it was 40 grand to play</v>
<v Speaker 1>cars with your paying the musicians,</v>

3149
02:05:00.160 --> 02:05:01.200
<v Speaker 1>a crew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the trucks,</v>

3150
02:05:01.201 --> 02:05:02.950
<v Speaker 1>everything and driving all the way out</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

3151
02:05:02.951 --> 02:05:04.650
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're not going to make 40</v>

3152
02:05:04.651 --> 02:05:07.560
<v Speaker 1>grand in record sale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just stowing weird and the old days</v>

3153
02:05:07.561 --> 02:05:10.110
<v Speaker 1>like you were saying one play on that</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're playing arenas.</v>

3154
02:05:10.250 --> 02:05:12.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to Paul Stanley about that</v>

3155
02:05:12.451 --> 02:05:14.610
<v Speaker 1>when he was in here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was real weird talking to him because</v>

3156
02:05:14.630 --> 02:05:18.690
<v Speaker 1>Paul Stanley of course was a huge</v>
<v Speaker 1>superstar in the 70s and it was all</v>

3157
02:05:18.691 --> 02:05:20.250
<v Speaker 1>record sales.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as a matter of fact,</v>

3158
02:05:20.251 --> 02:05:22.080
<v Speaker 1>they couldn't get on the radio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3159
02:05:22.081 --> 02:05:24.030
<v Speaker 1>kiss had a really hard time being on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>radio.</v>

3160
02:05:24.031 --> 02:05:26.070
<v Speaker 1>They were sorta Kinda blackballed on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside.</v>

3161
02:05:26.220 --> 02:05:29.340
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But just because of the love from their</v>

3162
02:05:29.341 --> 02:05:30.174
<v Speaker 1>fans.</v>

3163
02:05:30.330 --> 02:05:33.660
<v Speaker 1>They stayed valid of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they sell him fucking lunchboxes and</v>

3164
02:05:33.661 --> 02:05:35.400
<v Speaker 1>dolls and weird man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3165
02:05:35.401 --> 02:05:37.800
<v Speaker 1>when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a US kiss song on the radio,</v>

3166
02:05:37.801 --> 02:05:40.410
<v Speaker 1>like it was a moment to be excited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

3167
02:05:40.411 --> 02:05:43.050
<v Speaker 1>they're playing kiss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think dawn one they've ever played was</v>

<v Speaker 1>But they pay Detroit rock city</v>

3170

3174
02:05:54.211 --> 02:05:55.950
<v Speaker 1>remember being blown away like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

3175
02:05:55.951 --> 02:05:57.630
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe they're definitely not</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking seriously.</v>

3176
02:05:57.631 --> 02:05:58.231
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3177
02:05:58.231 --> 02:06:01.080

3179
02:06:02.171 --> 02:06:04.680

02:06:33.001 --> 02:06:34.980
<v Speaker 1>Like some of the all time great ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did kiss,</v>

3192
02:06:35.400 --> 02:06:37.130
<v Speaker 1>kiss double platinum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were really excited.</v>

3193
02:06:37.190 --> 02:06:40.590
<v Speaker 1>So I would get advanced copies of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit when I was a little kid.</v>

3194
02:06:41.100 --> 02:06:43.910
<v Speaker 1>I can't even imagine what getting an</v>
<v Speaker 1>advanced copy of record was when you're,</v>

3195
02:06:44.250 --> 02:06:45.960
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't something I would have known.</v>

3196
02:06:45.960 --> 02:06:49.250
<v Speaker 1>What an advance copy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you probably look it up.</v>

3197
02:06:49.270 --> 02:06:51.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my uncle was involved with that.</v>

3198
02:06:51.811 --> 02:06:53.430
<v Speaker 1>And who's involved at a couple of other</v>
<v Speaker 1>ones?</v>

3199
02:06:53.431 --> 02:06:54.264
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that the name?</v>

3200
02:06:54.270 --> 02:06:56.460
<v Speaker 1>There's a name there only.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who the guy who did the</v>

3201
02:06:56.461 --> 02:06:57.950
<v Speaker 1>painting was my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3202
02:06:58.020 --> 02:06:59.520
<v Speaker 1>I think they hired someone to do the</v>
<v Speaker 1>painting,</v>

3203
02:06:59.690 --> 02:07:04.170
<v Speaker 1>but there what the advertising agency</v>
<v Speaker 1>would do was designed like the inside of</v>

3204
02:07:04.171 --> 02:07:05.580
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like graphic design,</v>

3205
02:07:05.581 --> 02:07:08.640
<v Speaker 1>put all the photos and place and decide</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the font would look and all that</v>

3206
02:07:08.641 --> 02:07:10.050
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was really cool.</v>

3207
02:07:10.051 --> 02:07:13.080
<v Speaker 1>So when I was a kid that he would send</v>
<v Speaker 1>me these posters.</v>

3208
02:07:13.320 --> 02:07:16.380
<v Speaker 1>My mom just had them recently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I beat these fucking,</v>

3209
02:07:16.410 --> 02:07:18.450
<v Speaker 1>when they had their solo albums,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3210
02:07:18.451 --> 02:07:22.440
<v Speaker 1>they all have a individual hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had the actual posters from the</v>

3211
02:07:22.441 --> 02:07:23.730
<v Speaker 1>fucking way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3212
02:07:24.240 --> 02:07:26.940
<v Speaker 1>I had each one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think each record was dedicated to the</v>

3213
02:07:26.941 --> 02:07:27.420
<v Speaker 1>other three.</v>

3214

<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I was,</v>

3215
02:07:28.880 --> 02:07:33.880

3218
02:07:40.320 --> 02:07:41.790

3221
02:07:45.341 --> 02:07:47.020
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't have a song about a 16 year</v>

<v Speaker 1>got to have you.</v>

<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>

3224
02:07:55.090 --> 02:07:55.751
<v Speaker 1>Don't say it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I taught,</v>

3227
02:07:59.890 --> 02:08:00.750
<v Speaker 1>taught me out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3228
02:08:00.770 --> 02:08:01.480
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3229
02:08:01.480 --> 02:08:04.150
<v Speaker 1>There was a couple of good songs off</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the soul albums back in the New</v>

3230
02:08:04.150 --> 02:08:05.020
<v Speaker 1>York group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a good age.</v>

3231
02:08:05.021 --> 02:08:06.790
<v Speaker 1>Freely Song.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that was from the silhouette.</v>

3232
02:08:06.850 --> 02:08:07.683
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3233
02:08:07.750 --> 02:08:08.780
<v Speaker 1>Back in the New York group.</v>

3234
02:08:09.280 --> 02:08:11.890
<v Speaker 1>Unheralded Song.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aces Solo record was the best of the</v>

3235
02:08:11.900 --> 02:08:13.240
<v Speaker 1>solid ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3236
02:08:13.960 --> 02:08:16.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember him that well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I remember liking that one the best.</v>

3237
02:08:16.870 --> 02:08:18.310
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to go back and listen to them</v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

3238
02:08:18.760 --> 02:08:21.850
<v Speaker 1>Remember they did a little disco and for</v>
<v Speaker 1>awhile like I was made for loving you.</v>

3239
02:08:22.210 --> 02:08:24.280
<v Speaker 1>They went disco people make fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kinda like,</v>

3240
02:08:24.300 --> 02:08:26.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean looking back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was getting kinda good at the time</v>

3241
02:08:26.351 --> 02:08:28.060
<v Speaker 1>you hit song.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that song.</v>

3242
02:08:28.210 --> 02:08:29.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

3243
02:08:30.850 --> 02:08:33.100
<v Speaker 1>I want a disco shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was so shitty.</v>

3244
02:08:33.130 --> 02:08:34.240
<v Speaker 1>You listen to me now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds,</v>

3245
02:08:35.050 --> 02:08:37.960
<v Speaker 1>everything in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in looking back it was like,</v>

3246
02:08:38.590 --> 02:08:43.030
<v Speaker 1>now that music has gotten so shitty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean bg sound fucking likely the best</v>

3247
02:08:43.031 --> 02:08:45.010
<v Speaker 1>band you ever heard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's what's interesting is I</v>

3248
02:08:45.011 --> 02:08:49.210
<v Speaker 1>think they were unjustly criticized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you listened to their style of</v>

3249
02:08:49.211 --> 02:08:50.910
<v Speaker 1>music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3250
02:08:51.010 --> 02:08:53.230
<v Speaker 1>they had some really good songs.</v>

3251
02:08:53.230 --> 02:08:55.680
<v Speaker 1>The bgs had some interesting songs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can,</v>

3252
02:08:55.730 --> 02:08:57.200
<v Speaker 1>I can name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3253
02:08:57.220 --> 02:09:00.220
<v Speaker 1>but there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can name you 20 killer bg songs and</v>

3254
02:09:00.221 --> 02:09:01.480
<v Speaker 1>that's another thing too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3255
02:09:01.510 --> 02:09:03.310
<v Speaker 1>it's important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like you're,</v>

3256
02:09:03.340 --> 02:09:04.270
<v Speaker 1>you're with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3257
02:09:04.500 --> 02:09:08.320
<v Speaker 1>Was Not all kinds of music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love all kinds of people that make the</v>

3258
02:09:08.321 --> 02:09:11.410
<v Speaker 1>shitty country that we were pointing out</v>
<v Speaker 1>before all they listened to his pop</v>

3259
02:09:11.411 --> 02:09:13.060
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all I listen to the people.</v>

3260
02:09:13.540 --> 02:09:16.690
<v Speaker 1>I was reading an interview with prince</v>
<v Speaker 1>once and he was,</v>

3261
02:09:17.470 --> 02:09:19.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember exactly what he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's talking about how much you</v>

3262
02:09:19.361 --> 02:09:22.090
<v Speaker 1>loved</v>
<v Speaker 1>James Brown.</v>

3263
02:09:22.091 --> 02:09:24.190
<v Speaker 1>He in later in the interview he talks</v>
<v Speaker 1>about Joni Mitchell,</v>

3264
02:09:24.191 --> 02:09:26.490
<v Speaker 1>how much you love Joni Mitchell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how you become prints,</v>

3265
02:09:26.580 --> 02:09:28.690
<v Speaker 1>right when you love James Brown and Joni</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mitchell.</v>

3266
02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:30.730
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's two completely different</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

3267
02:09:30.731 --> 02:09:32.590
<v Speaker 1>And then it comes out through prince as</v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

3268
02:09:32.600 --> 02:09:36.010
<v Speaker 1>but if he only listened to James Brown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just sounded like a James Brown repo.</v>

3269
02:09:36.310 --> 02:09:39.200
<v Speaker 1>It's the other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the folk music and the Weird Shit that</v>

3270
02:09:39.201 --> 02:09:41.270
<v Speaker 1>you listened to that made him such a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking kid.</v>

3271
02:09:41.271 --> 02:09:43.780
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think music is a lot like everything</v>

3272
02:09:43.781 --> 02:09:46.150
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I like variety and all kinds of</v>

3273
02:09:46.151 --> 02:09:50.320
<v Speaker 1>different foods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like variety and art and architecture</v>

3274
02:09:50.321 --> 02:09:53.800
<v Speaker 1>and I like variety and music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting to hear like more than</v>

3275
02:09:53.801 --> 02:09:56.140
<v Speaker 1>a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a good fucking song.</v>

3276
02:09:56.170 --> 02:09:57.810
<v Speaker 1>That bg song.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

3277
02:09:58.510 --> 02:10:00.430
<v Speaker 1>When you saw it in that movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saturday night fever,</v>

3278
02:10:00.850 --> 02:10:03.730
<v Speaker 1>it's a great fun try not dance into</v>
<v Speaker 1>staying alive.</v>

3279
02:10:03.760 --> 02:10:05.260
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm talking about.</v>

3280
02:10:05.290 --> 02:10:07.160
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good fucking song.</v>

3281
02:10:07.960 --> 02:10:10.210
<v Speaker 1>That era,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were looking at that like,</v>

3282
02:10:10.211 --> 02:10:12.130
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have this instead of led Zepplin.</v>

3283
02:10:12.370 --> 02:10:14.260
<v Speaker 1>This is what replaced the doors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3284
02:10:14.261 --> 02:10:15.430
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you get older,</v>

3285
02:10:15.431 --> 02:10:17.370
<v Speaker 1>you realize that you can listen to both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kind of what happened to,</v>

3286
02:10:17.410 --> 02:10:19.440
<v Speaker 1>like I was talking about before with me</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's like,</v>

3287
02:10:19.630 --> 02:10:20.740
<v Speaker 1>when you got into rock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3288
02:10:20.950 --> 02:10:21.783
<v Speaker 1>wait a second.</v>

3289
02:10:22.740 --> 02:10:26.690
<v Speaker 1>Leyland and John Lennon aren't that</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking far apart.</v>

3290
02:10:27.580 --> 02:10:30.850
<v Speaker 1>They're much closer together than like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what's playing on the radio</v>

3291
02:10:30.851 --> 02:10:32.000
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3292
02:10:32.530 --> 02:10:33.363
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3293
02:10:34.180 --> 02:10:35.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean waylon used to play with buddy</v>
<v Speaker 1>holly.</v>

3294
02:10:35.720 --> 02:10:37.490
<v Speaker 1>That's all you got to start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No Shit.</v>

3295
02:10:37.790 --> 02:10:38.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he started,</v>

3296
02:10:38.450 --> 02:10:40.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's the most famous story of</v>
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

3297
02:10:40.581 --> 02:10:42.170
<v Speaker 1>but he had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's supposed to be on that plane.</v>

3298
02:10:42.500 --> 02:10:46.370
<v Speaker 1>Dwight Yoakam was probably the first guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a real country guy that I was a</v>

3299
02:10:46.371 --> 02:10:47.900
<v Speaker 1>fan of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a fan of Dwight.</v>

3300
02:10:47.901 --> 02:10:50.120
<v Speaker 1>He kinda crossed over a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to happen.</v>

3301
02:10:50.121 --> 02:10:53.000
<v Speaker 1>He's a Kentucky boy as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of great music from Kentucky.</v>

3302
02:10:53.001 --> 02:10:54.080
<v Speaker 1>Huh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he,</v>

3303
02:10:54.140 --> 02:10:56.510
<v Speaker 1>I always thought of him as the Kentucky</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guy and he is,</v>

3304
02:10:56.511 --> 02:10:59.180
<v Speaker 1>but he actually had to move to la to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make it.</v>

3305
02:10:59.181 --> 02:11:02.420
<v Speaker 1>He had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was in the punk scene out here cause</v>

3306
02:11:02.421 --> 02:11:06.050
<v Speaker 1>back then like wearing a dressing like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

3307
02:11:06.051 --> 02:11:10.820
<v Speaker 1>wearing the cowboy hat and plan kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>old style buck owens country was thought</v>

3308
02:11:10.830 --> 02:11:12.170
<v Speaker 1>of as crazy as it.</v>

3309
02:11:12.230 --> 02:11:13.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't playing,</v>

3310
02:11:14.540 --> 02:11:15.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>punk music,</v>

3311
02:11:15.651 --> 02:11:19.090
<v Speaker 1>but he was an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was kind of an out right outside or</v>

3312
02:11:19.100 --> 02:11:19.860
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3313
02:11:19.860 --> 02:11:22.010
<v Speaker 1>and that was thought of as like a weird</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing to be doing.</v>

3314
02:11:22.130 --> 02:11:26.360
<v Speaker 1>He'd seemed to me that what he was doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>was like an Ode to the classics,</v>

3315
02:11:26.570 --> 02:11:28.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like he was a [inaudible].</v>

3316
02:11:28.740 --> 02:11:33.140
<v Speaker 1>He also put his own spin on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>200% a hundred percent but you like it</v>

3317
02:11:33.141 --> 02:11:35.840
<v Speaker 1>reminiscent of like really great country</v>
<v Speaker 1>music of old.</v>

3318
02:11:35.841 --> 02:11:39.540
<v Speaker 1>Like he was obviously a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a huge fan of that music and</v>

3319
02:11:39.541 --> 02:11:40.970
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt like he was one of the first guys</v>

3320
02:11:41.510 --> 02:11:45.940
<v Speaker 1>who</v>
<v Speaker 1>brought that old sound back but kind of</v>

3321
02:11:45.941 --> 02:11:49.220
<v Speaker 1>got some,</v>

<v Speaker 1>with going back to the old guys.</v>

<v Speaker 1>done that.</v>

3327
02:12:00.561 --> 02:12:03.440
<v Speaker 1>It was a huge hit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was inspiration to subtract two</v>

<v Speaker 1>there's something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

02:15:04.851 --> 02:15:08.340
<v Speaker 1>so I don't get mad when people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is very outlaw and a lot of ways</v>

3409
02:15:08.341 --> 02:15:10.270
<v Speaker 1>by the method of going about putting it</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

3410
02:15:10.600 --> 02:15:15.360
<v Speaker 1>But I'll to defend them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you don't want to claim it because</v>

3411
02:15:15.361 --> 02:15:17.670
<v Speaker 1>it's like an iconic name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like outlaw country,</v>

3412
02:15:17.671 --> 02:15:19.170
<v Speaker 1>like those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But those guys were,</v>

3413
02:15:19.200 --> 02:15:21.780
<v Speaker 1>that was when pop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that was when country music,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that country on the radio then sound</v>

3415
02:15:23.800 --> 02:15:24.900
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sounds great now,</v>

3416
02:15:24.901 --> 02:15:26.910
<v Speaker 1>but it was a lot of strings and got</v>
<v Speaker 1>really lush.</v>

3417
02:15:27.510 --> 02:15:30.780
<v Speaker 1>And then people like Waylon Willie moved</v>
<v Speaker 1>out in Nashville,</v>

3418
02:15:30.781 --> 02:15:33.030

<v Speaker 1>So they were really pushing the</v>

3427
02:15:46.501 --> 02:15:47.400
<v Speaker 1>envelope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3428
02:15:47.401 --> 02:15:50.010
<v Speaker 1>way more than anything I've ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nashville have any,</v>

3429
02:15:50.011 --> 02:15:52.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much of Nashville like real music</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3431
02:15:54.840 --> 02:15:56.550

3432
02:15:56.700 --> 02:16:00.090
<v Speaker 1>it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so funny because like I said,</v>

3433
02:16:00.091 --> 02:16:02.820
<v Speaker 1>most of my family's from Nashville,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I went there all the time growing up</v>

3434
02:16:03.250 --> 02:16:04.890
<v Speaker 1>and it was really almost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a ghost town,</v>

3435
02:16:04.891 --> 02:16:07.140
<v Speaker 1>but it was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a kind of,</v>

3436
02:16:07.210 --> 02:16:09.930
<v Speaker 1>had a small town feel and you would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you would see crystal gayle or</v>

3437
02:16:09.931 --> 02:16:13.740
<v Speaker 1>whoever it was on the streets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but has known it was senator of country</v>

3438
02:16:13.741 --> 02:16:14.670

<v Speaker 1>but it was,</v>

3439
02:16:15.630 --> 02:16:19.080
<v Speaker 1>it was not</v>
<v Speaker 1>a flashy town.</v>

3440
02:16:19.080 --> 02:16:20.790
<v Speaker 1>And now it's the place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Honey honey.</v>

3561
02:20:39.901 --> 02:20:42.110
<v Speaker 1>His last album was fucking great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ren Dunkin.</v>

3562
02:20:42.140 --> 02:20:43.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was awesome.</v>

3563
02:20:43.250 --> 02:20:45.740
<v Speaker 1>They were amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're really good man.</v>

3564
02:20:45.741 --> 02:20:47.390
<v Speaker 1>And he does it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does this,</v>

3565
02:20:48.020 --> 02:20:49.850
<v Speaker 1>that's them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's them backing me at honey.</v>

3566
02:20:49.851 --> 02:20:53.630
<v Speaker 1>Honey engaging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a,</v>

3567
02:20:55.190 --> 02:20:56.720
<v Speaker 1>she has a beard on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3568
02:20:56.721 --> 02:20:58.190
<v Speaker 1>I think that that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>

3569
02:20:58.360 --> 02:21:01.640
<v Speaker 1>that was a sign of things to come when</v>
<v Speaker 1>people want to dress up in costume,</v>

3570
02:21:01.641 --> 02:21:02.940
<v Speaker 1>when they're backing me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're on station,</v>

3571
02:21:03.620 --> 02:21:05.720
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to be seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I should've seen that as a,</v>

3572
02:21:06.110 --> 02:21:07.700
<v Speaker 1>as a possible sign that maybe I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

3573
02:21:07.700 --> 02:21:08.810
<v Speaker 1>It was a little bit out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3574
02:21:08.840 --> 02:21:11.090
<v Speaker 1>what I was going to say about them was</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have this song,</v>

3575
02:21:11.340 --> 02:21:14.790
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I used a part of the song on my,</v>

3576
02:21:14.791 --> 02:21:17.000
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the music for it with my comedy central</v>

3577
02:21:17.001 --> 02:21:18.230
<v Speaker 1>special,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the opening music.</v>

3578
02:21:18.560 --> 02:21:20.390
<v Speaker 1>That's all from them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how I know her music.</v>

3579
02:21:20.750 --> 02:21:25.750
<v Speaker 1>And it's a song called punk kid and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't put it out because they made it,</v>

3580
02:21:26.211 --> 02:21:27.890
<v Speaker 1>they spent all their own money making</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

3581
02:21:27.891 --> 02:21:31.250
<v Speaker 1>but the record company wanted it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so like when the record company</v>

3582
02:21:31.251 --> 02:21:33.800
<v Speaker 1>hired them to do a song or do a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an album,</v>

3583
02:21:33.920 --> 02:21:36.920
<v Speaker 1>they wanted the punk kid song and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted it for free and they're like,</v>

3584
02:21:36.921 --> 02:21:38.480
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we spent all this money on that</v>

3585
02:21:38.481 --> 02:21:39.440
<v Speaker 1>song.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is our song.</v>

3586
02:21:39.441 --> 02:21:40.820
<v Speaker 1>We wrote it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't own this.</v>

3587
02:21:40.821 --> 02:21:42.820
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't gain the song.</v>

3588
02:21:42.830 --> 02:21:44.180
<v Speaker 1>When they tried to and they said no.</v>

3589
02:21:44.180 --> 02:21:46.610
<v Speaker 1>So that song,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's out in the ether.</v>

3590
02:21:46.640 --> 02:21:48.980
<v Speaker 1>So you have to figure out what to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>with that song that's going to hold onto</v>

3591
02:21:48.981 --> 02:21:51.410
<v Speaker 1>it for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will say I did learn,</v>

3592
02:21:51.411 --> 02:21:53.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being around the music as much in the</v>

3593
02:21:53.241 --> 02:21:55.670
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew I'd heard all those stories.</v>

3594
02:21:55.700 --> 02:21:57.160
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I bought my mat,</v>

3595
02:21:57.490 --> 02:21:59.060
<v Speaker 1>my master's degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't do fucking,</v>

3596
02:21:59.090 --> 02:22:00.560
<v Speaker 1>you can't touch this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't.</v>

3597
02:22:00.561 --> 02:22:02.360
<v Speaker 1>You don't need them anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I'm quoting the hammer,</v>

3598
02:22:02.440 --> 02:22:05.030
<v Speaker 1>you know you don't need them anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like what we're talking about</v>

3599
02:22:05.031 --> 02:22:07.040
<v Speaker 1>about distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll get more distribution from doing</v>

3600
02:22:07.041 --> 02:22:09.300
<v Speaker 1>this show or more people here.</v>
